1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,610
By herself in a house.
Like she should series.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,390
The thing about buying a house,
Jamie and me,

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,510
you yes.
Are you should fear in the fucking

4
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:14,940
house.
So we feel like we're doing something.

5
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:17,850
There we go.
These headphones make a difference.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,280
It's so much easier without glasses.
They used to pinch me.

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,460
Oh,
that's right.

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,840
Crush my ears just went and got your
eyes cut on.

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,830
They put a fucking laser right to your
eyeball and they go,

10
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:30,310
don't look at it.
I'm like,

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,440
it's IRA.
I Blah.

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,270
Oh Wow.
Because you're looking at him like,

13
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:35,220
I know I'm looking at it,
it's right in my eyeball.

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,650
So what do you have to do?
What?

15
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,080
Which one are you ready to head?
And so they come in like this looks,

16
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,030
but then it's like right as it gets
right into your eyes,

17
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:45,300
slightly to the left.
Like it goes to like the outside of the,

18
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,010
the black part,
you know.

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,410
How do they keep your eyeballs opened
from blinking?

20
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,450
Uh,
um,

21
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,420
what's it called?
Style.

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,890
Like a speculum.
Yeah,

23
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:54,990
but what's that movie?
Clockwork.

24
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,400
Yeah.
They do that to,

25
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,400
you know,
really hitting you with drops to like

26
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:00,680
wet it.
Oh my God.

27
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,850
That they peel back the layer like a
grape,

28
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,000
you know,
like the show up rate.

29
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,210
How does that feel?
Nothing.

30
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,820
It doesn't feel like anything.
You can't really feel it whoa.

31
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,140
Later.
It feels like,

32
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,620
cause it's like a slight scar that has
to heal.

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,530
But you're not used to having a scar
between your eyelid in your eyeball.

34
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,140
So it feels like a piece of sand is in
there and they're like,

35
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:21,240
do not rub it.
There's no sand in there.

36
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,480
Just don't rub it.
I balls or some fucking serious shit.

37
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:29,481
It's one of the most disturbing things
to me about mma is I pokes when guys

38
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:32,020
get,
I poked almost I'd to,

39
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,750
I'd rather see a guy get hit real hard.

40
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,950
They didn't get I poked.
That was the worst thing of on a game of

41
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:39,630
thrones.
Oh God,

42
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:42,720
dude crushed him with two I boiler
alert,

43
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:46,380
whatever spoiler stuff that's five years
old.

44
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,070
It's not that I knew show was like three
or four years old dude who got smushed.

45
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:55,400
It was bad ass ass.
I wanted to win so bad.

46
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,620
He had so much going for him so much.
He was going to get revenge.

47
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:01,740
Finally he had flare,
he had technique.

48
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,250
He was a bisexual.
Yeah,

49
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,010
but they all were back then.
Man.

50
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,090
People just fucked everybody back.
Then there's like,

51
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,740
there's so much of a different world.
If we think about like what the Romans

52
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:19,200
did and what all these different
cultures did,

53
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,530
they were like fucking each other.
Fucking young boys like young boys.

54
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:27,270
It was normal for guys to fuck young
boy.

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,700
Like what the hell?
Better World.

56
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:30,534
Right?

57
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,520
It's fucking strange when you go back
and you listen to like,

58
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:36,580
it was plato,
right?

59
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,340
Plato was one of the big ones.
The big boy fuckers wasn't he fucker.

60
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,670
I think polito was a soldier.
He uh,

61
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,680
he was uh,
like a,

62
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:48,330
a warrior,
like accomplished warrior then

63
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,490
philosopher.
Yeah.

64
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:53,580
If I'm remembering this story correctly,
which we're pretty fucking high,

65
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:56,700
right?
Which is probably wrong high right now

66
00:02:56,701 --> 00:03:00,430
and it's awakened big day.
Has this pet or have you heard that

67
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:02,800
term?
What does that,

68
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:04,720
when I googled him and boys,
that's what comes up.

69
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:07,360
So what does a better us?
It means someone who likes to fuck young

70
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:08,194
boys.

71
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,300
It's bizarre that that was like really
commonplace amongst very respected

72
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:19,570
intellectuals at one point in human
history played or didn't lose his

73
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:24,571
fucking subway campaign.
You could go on big philosophers in

74
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:28,091
history.
Yeah,

75
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:31,210
you don't take it away.
If they're dead and it's a long time

76
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,330
ago,
we set,

77
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,280
well,
I mean we should,

78
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,080
right?
Because he had a lot to contribute.

79
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,260
We should,
we should accept aberrant behavior,

80
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,440
but we should also maybe look at it as a
sign of,

81
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,060
there's some,
there's massive advancement and

82
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:51,061
understanding about human beings,
about the consequences of sexual abuse,

83
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:54,280
like all those things,
like I don't think they really had

84
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:57,190
enough time to live to figure things out
enough.

85
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,610
Everyone's was dead at 30 right.
There's going to fuck them up as adults.

86
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,211
I'm like,
wait,

87
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:03,610
what did you,
how fucking stupid this country is,

88
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,950
right.
How ridiculous we are if we look at each

89
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:06,820
other as a collective.

90
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,540
When you find out things that people get
upset with something or tweeted today

91
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,880
about this,
was it chase,

92
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:14,200
whatever,
whatever bank it was,

93
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,310
they wouldn't allow a guys checked.
They canceled his check because he wrote

94
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:23,290
dash on it,
which is his fucking dogs name Dash and

95
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,980
they thought dash was too close to an
Islamic word,

96
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,140
which is like a d a.
E.

97
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,150
S.
A.

98
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,600
Where did he write it on it?
He wrote it on a check like two.

99
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:33,430
It's fucking dog.
Where's this money going?

100
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,520
Note to south dog might like maybe just
dog got out of the memo.

101
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:40,150
Pus some,
some part of it like pull it up Jamie.

102
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:42,090
Cause I thought it was in his lap
mcmahon.

103
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,810
That was the reason they can't you send
something to a guy named I met exactly.

104
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,600
What if the guy's name is Muhammad or we
fucked.

105
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:54,160
Now how does Mohammad Ali get his checks
out of the homiletic bank?

106
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,280
Freezes online payment over Doug's
terrorist sounding name.

107
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,400
Po.
Can you scroll it so we could see what

108
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,500
the words are because it's hurting my
brain.

109
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,020
I have a picture of her.
You guys trying to find the picture and

110
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:09,070
here's the young guy he's got,
he's got to think he's got,

111
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:10,750
um,
that makes them get more sympathy for

112
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:12,240
sure.
The scroll up went noose.

113
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,690
What was his disease?
Jamie?

114
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,491
I want to see,
yeah,

115
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:18,880
multiple sclerosis.
He was transferring money from his chase

116
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:19,780
account.
Whose dog?

117
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:22,190
Walker.
So he put the nine year old pitbulls

118
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,500
moniker dash in the memo line because
this is to pay for his fucking dog

119
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:27,390
Walker.
Yeah.

120
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,520
And it's too much like d a.
E.

121
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,980
S.
H the Arabic term for self described

122
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:35,140
Islamic state.
That's their word for isis.

123
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,680
Yes.
I guess.

124
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,710
But it's not the same word.
You fucks.

125
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,890
That's like you,
you can't write nagger explain what

126
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:45,740
someone's that nags.

127
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,110
You can't write that.
Oh,

128
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:50,680
is it because I mean donating money to
isis and he's like,

129
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,460
uh,
hold on.

130
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,540
Yes,
exactly.

131
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,170
They thought for some reason that that
was a red flag or you're not allowed to

132
00:05:57,171 --> 00:06:01,450
give money to isis.
I don't think you're allowed to look at

133
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,740
it.
Says it says it flagged a payment,

134
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,700
which place to note on Francis Account
asking him to explain what dash

135
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,000
explaining yourself son,
God dammit soldiers died.

136
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,490
But it's the,
it's not the same word,

137
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,790
like think of how many words day die.
I mean does it w w w w what are we going

138
00:06:20,461 --> 00:06:24,740
to da e s h is not the same as d a s.
H,

139
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,820
right?
Is that what it is?

140
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:26,960
D.
A.

141
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:26,960
E.
S.

142
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,793
H.
Yeah.

143
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,370
It's just not the same word.
Like we have combinations of words that

144
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:34,130
are vastly different.
So this is one extra letter.

145
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,830
Yes,
it is a word and it means to go fast.

146
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,770
It everybody knows it.
It's so stupid.

147
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,170
I mean,
you think there's so many different

148
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:47,171
combinations that you can say our close
flagged reviewed and eventually released

149
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,240
out an hour.
What about that other,

150
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,290
the same thing?
Is it the same word?

151
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,260
Should we flag it?
Is it the same?

152
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:59,630
What do you mean?
Did you mean out or hour?

153
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:02,060
I wrote out,
I wrote out you fuck.

154
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:02,661
Well,

155
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:04,580
but we would like to know if you met

156
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,060

157
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,970

158
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,833
You fucks.
Okay.

159
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,520
That's cleared up,
but I don't think you have to call us

160
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:12,920
fucks by you.
Why are you contacting me?

161
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,830
This is not what you're supposed to do.
We supposed to do is pay my goddamn dog

162
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:19,490
walker so I don't look like a dickhead.
So she's got a pair of fucking rent and

163
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,750
you ruined everything.
Sorry,

164
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,550
I understand you're upset,
but if you're just calm down,

165
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:25,640
we're trying to stop terrorism.
It's fucking the Rothschild's or some

166
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:27,450
shit.
Chem trails sort of.

167
00:07:27,451 --> 00:07:32,420
If you could watch a longer scenes and
nine 11 all together with the fucking

168
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:37,421
moon landing and area 51 bullshit.
I want my fucking money.

169
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,490
She's a great dog.
Ever lose it on a customer service

170
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:43,881
person.
I'm like,

171
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:46,240
that is fucking go nuts.
I'm not like that.

172
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,260
I try.
I try to be,

173
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:50,480
I hate those jobs.
I wouldn't want that job.

174
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,550
They don't want that job.
I tried to be,

175
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,270
I know it's not never their fault.
I try to be as nice as possible.

176
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,790
Some people are just so,
it's not even their fault.

177
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,300
Something people that you talk to like
customer service people are so like if,

178
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,210
if it's for something Shitty,
like something that happens all the

179
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:07,460
time,
like they're dealing with so many people

180
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:10,460
that are complaining all the time.
Oh right.

181
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,500
Yeah.
I remember when apples,

182
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,910
uh,
Robert,

183
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,180
the iphone,
oh yeah.

184
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:15,890
End Up,
you know,

185
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,350
18th he only had it drops,
calls were dropped left and right

186
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,780
because everyone had gone on there and I
was like,

187
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:21,190
what's up?

188
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:21,860
He goes,
I was like,

189
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,710
Hey,
you must deal with a lot of calls about

190
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:27,320
drop calls.
Like it's a lot.

191
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,160
It's a lot of angry people.
I remember I had a guy talked me through

192
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,890
some issue on my phone once I had to
call a dude.

193
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,420
I don't remember what the exact issue
was,

194
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:37,850
but like all my contacts went away.
I was like,

195
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,160
what is going on here?
And he had to talk me through it and

196
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:44,220
figure out how to get it back to the way
it used to be an update things.

197
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:45,590
So it was,
it was a nightmare.

198
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,510
But I remember the guy while I was like,
dude,

199
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,790
okay,
how much does this job suck?

200
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,160
Like go,
I'm not completely retarded and you're

201
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:54,770
trying to help me through this.
And I've built computers.

202
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:55,980
I,
I've taken a

203
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,420
motherboard,
I put it in,

204
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,420
I put the seat,
I put the heat sink in,

205
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:02,700
and I've done all that added video
cards.

206
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:04,560
I know a little bit about computers,
just,

207
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,840
I mean,
I'm not like a computer wizard,

208
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:08,730
but long,
average retard.

209
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,610
Right?
And I was barely figuring it out.

210
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,241
I was like,
okay,

211
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:13,920
I gotta go back.
I got to delete.

212
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,450
What do I do?
I start fresh.

213
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,010
Okay.
I go to my backup.

214
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,140
I have a backup.
I was at with the key law.

215
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,670
Well,
where did they go?

216
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:24,150
Where's all my contacts go?
Why did they get chewed up like this?

217
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,350
I don't know anybody's,
fuck,

218
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:27,630
I don't know your number.
You're the same number forever.

219
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:29,790
I don't know what the fuck it is.
I just look at my phone,

220
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,700
I find your number and I call you.
And um,

221
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,470
but I remember talking to the guy going
like,

222
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,850
what is this like,
man?

223
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,720
He's like,
dude,

224
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,970
I can't even describe it.
He's like,

225
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:43,230
people call up you like if you ever even
see if you have a phone or a video or

226
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:44,570
are you just crazy?
They say,

227
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,830
he says to them,
he wants to say to them like,

228
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:48,210
do you know how to be like,
okay,

229
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:54,370
did you turn it on
but the phone's black.

230
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,500
I saw somebody in the airport doing that
but on a call like I don't understand.

231
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:01,170
How do you get the thing to send and I
want to be like,

232
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,790
Hey lady,
that send button at the bottom is what

233
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,820
you're looking for.
Sometimes it talks to me.

234
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,160
That's that Siri,
ma'am,

235
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,000
why does Siri,
what is theory?

236
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,180
Is it important what they're saying?
Did you say,

237
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,300
Hey Siri,
what the fuck are you?

238
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,580
I don't know what I said.
Phone is talking to me is a bigger issue

239
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,710
when you say,
Hey Siri,

240
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,450
Hey Siri.

241
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,710
I like me saying this right now.
Over and over again.

242
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:34,200
People right now,
all across the world are yelling at me.

243
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,110
He'd get mad,
they get mad cause it start.

244
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:42,111
Your phone starts talking to you like it
happened to me when I was in my car

245
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,690
listening to a podcast of us talk to you
about,

246
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:49,620
Hey Siri,
my phone went off because the podcast

247
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:50,550
said,
Hey Siri.

248
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,460
So my phone started asking me what can I
do for you?

249
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:55,020
I was like,
oh my God,

250
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:58,170
this is ridiculous.
And sometimes it starts transcribing

251
00:10:58,171 --> 00:10:59,730
things sometimes.
Like,

252
00:10:59,731 --> 00:11:02,460
Hey,
Siri will activate and then it'll

253
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,400
transcribe a whole list of shit that
you're saying.

254
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,570
Wow.
Yeah.

255
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,570
I'm like,
what do you do?

256
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,270
That's not my question.
Like,

257
00:11:09,271 --> 00:11:10,710
Hey,
Siri thinks you have like a four

258
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,280
paragraph long question for it.
So you're just like,

259
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,930
oh hey Siri,
look up hardcore black and white

260
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:21,020
pornography.
I'm a different person at work.

261
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,120
I don't even care about those things.
Work

262
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,360
at work.
I wear a suit and I have very special

263
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:37,470
behavior.
I'm a different person here.

264
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,330
I am.
I different.

265
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,190
I used to,
I used to wear my yarmulke up,

266
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:42,490
my law firm.
I worked at it as a,

267
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:47,491
it's like a 1718 year olds and um,
and then I would take it out.

268
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:51,600
What would I do?
Owe a lot of guys,

269
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:53,980
law lawyers were coming in to take the
Yamaka office and as I got

270
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,000
in,
because I wanted to blend in,

271
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,110
but I would keep mine on whatever,
but the next year I lost my religion and

272
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:02,020
then I didn't want to explain to
everybody that I did wasn't religious

273
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,330
anymore.
So I would come in,

274
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,950
put my Yamaka on and then as soon as I
left I would just take it off again.

275
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,330
Ooh,
that's a good mood.

276
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,410
Yeah.
For a whole summer.

277
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,450
That's a better move than explaining it.
Yeah.

278
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,160
Planning.
It is a lot of work.

279
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,980
That's how much I had to every person.
It's the same explanation,

280
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,910
but if you worked in a small office with
people that you really liked,

281
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,980
it wouldn't be that big.
It was four or five people.

282
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,000
Who are one sec guys.
Uh,

283
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,850
sorry.
I realized I was all bullshit.

284
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,930
Hey he fella.
Where's your special hat?

285
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,940
We had a lady follow us up once on the
elevator telling you and this other guy

286
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,111
were like,
what?

287
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:38,990
Flora?
And she goes up,

288
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,840
do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as
your personal savior?

289
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,870
I don't know what floor.
That's,

290
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,180
Huh.
I was like,

291
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:47,951
shoot,
didn't even,

292
00:12:47,951 --> 00:12:49,480
wasn't even going there.
She followed us.

293
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,490
We were going for lunch.
She came back and followed up at the

294
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:53,770
elevator.
Just don't do that.

295
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,480
What's worse?
Dem vegans

296
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,680
like for proselytizing?
Who's the co who hits you the hardest?

297
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,380
At the heart of it,
they see Jesus freaks.

298
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,720
Just want to help your soul.
Right.

299
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:10,580
Good call.
What does what of vegans want?

300
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,540
They want the animals.
Yeah.

301
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,420
And now not at the heart of it.
They both want to feel better than you.

302
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,530
Yes.
Yeah.

303
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,170
Yeah.
Michael Shermer calls it virtue

304
00:13:20,171 --> 00:13:21,490
signaling.
You met Michael Shermer.

305
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,280
Yeah.
He's,

306
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,010
he's the best.
Yeah.

307
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,660
He was on a couple of weeks ago.
Great Guy.

308
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,580
Real Nice Guy.
Like very fun to talk to a wise man.

309
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,980
Yeah.
Because it virtue signaling.

310
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,650
It's a great way of describing me.
You're signaling to everyone that you

311
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:37,150
have virtue by your action.

312
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,570
Peacocking your virtue,
you know,

313
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,690
and uh,
it,

314
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,440
it annoys the fuck out of people.
Yeah.

315
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,480
It's gross.
It's gross.

316
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:48,850
Like from,
from all sorts of different standpoints.

317
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:52,840
Not just about your diet,
but about a lot of different things.

318
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:55,060
New Aa people are like that.
Yeah.

319
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:58,360
New Aa.
People who love Yoga people could be

320
00:13:58,361 --> 00:13:59,890
like that.
I've been guilty.

321
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,680
Really guilty or that I'm annoying.
I just feel so clear now.

322
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:03,191
I,
yeah,

323
00:14:03,191 --> 00:14:04,220
I'm annoying with that.
Oh,

324
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,090
I used to give me a gluten free gluten
free work for a little while.

325
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,390
Here's what the gluten free taught
taught me.

326
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,400
Um,
I don't really have a tolerance problem

327
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:15,430
to gluten,
but gluten is essentially sugar.

328
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,470
When you,
when you're getting gluten,

329
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,170
you're getting getting it from bread and
gluten is like a protein.

330
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,660
Wheat bread is fucking sugar.
Yeah.

331
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,550
Sugar.
I go without,

332
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,320
um,
without sugar on Wednesdays.

333
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,610
And then,
uh,

334
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,610
Mike vacuum was like pizza,
but that just turns to sugar in your

335
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:30,820
body.

336
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,210
But shut up scientist.
I'm not talking about that.

337
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,200
I cut all that stuff out too.
And sugar.

338
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,093
Yeah.
Wow.

339
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,030
No Pizza.
Nope.

340
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,323
No,
I don't need it anymore.

341
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,290
He didn't eat that bread last night.
Talking to all those door guys.

342
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:49,060
Devour the leftovers.
It's pounds of meat.

343
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,590
Yeah.
There's this place called doctor uglies,

344
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,000
Tyler,
Texas barbecue.

345
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,660
And it's out in Van Nuys,
California and is my all time favorite

346
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:59,390
barbecue spot in California for sure.
One.

347
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,890
And what's one of the best in the
country?

348
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,450
It's amazing cause those ribs look like
fucking flintstones.

349
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,590
Yup.
There were massive,

350
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,730
super legit too.
Like the paneling on the wall is like

351
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:15,490
shitty fake wood.
It's been the same way since 1974 it's

352
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,420
just,
it's just classic.

353
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:22,160
It is a classic restaurant.
It is Americana and they give you an

354
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:25,160
insane portion of me.
So much meat.

355
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,200
I can't believe I the way that that,
okay,

356
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:28,830
that was a,
that's a try.

357
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,920
Those,
what does it shows three different

358
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:32,750
things.
That was triple Combo.

359
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,000
Triple Combo.
You had beef ribs,

360
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,420
so you had spare ribs and yet Greski
obviously brisket,

361
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,130
you can't go to a barbecue.
What's it like having the brisket?

362
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:43,280
If you've got a combo,
it's hard and brisk and figure out what

363
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:44,114
else do you want.
Yeah,

364
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,210
that was 23 bucks.
It's nice,

365
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,680
but it wasn't even that much.
It's insane amount of food because

366
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,540
that's easily enough food for three
people,

367
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,180
like we pigged out and eat it all.
But three reasonable people that place

368
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,590
for me.
And plus they give you sides.

369
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:59,210
What are we doing?
A commercial for?

370
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:01,340
Animals die for that.
She didn't even tell everybody about it.

371
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,040
I don't want anybody to know.
Why do one do well?

372
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:08,410
What are the best barbecues you've ever,
there's a bunch of good spots in Texas.

373
00:16:08,411 --> 00:16:10,850
There's a bunch of good spots outside of
Austin Franklin.

374
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,140
Uh,
I've been the one outside of us,

375
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:14,360
but Franklin in Austin,
Franklin Barbecue is supposed to be

376
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:15,021
insane.
Yeah.

377
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:18,080
And the cool thing is,
so the lines are coming down the street.

378
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:19,310
The first time I went,
it was raining.

379
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,080
I got lucky.
I waited for an hour and a half.

380
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,730
Uh,
totally worth it.

381
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,470
Why?
Because it was raining because it was

382
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:25,760
right there.
And they,

383
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:27,260
uh,
they said everybody come on and off the

384
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:28,190
street,
get under the cover,

385
00:16:28,191 --> 00:16:29,270
we'll go.
They're all cool people.

386
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,700
But industry has risen up around that
line.

387
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,520
Like that is task rabbit people.
They'll wait in line for you for 20

388
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:36,050
bucks,
but now they're onto them.

389
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:37,460
So like,
you can only order for up to like four

390
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:42,461
people a fucking chair.
Salesmen's they have rental chairs up in

391
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:44,390
line.
Just waiting there like,

392
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:45,770
hey,
well I can make money.

393
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,780
Does it find a chair for you and the
line moves?

394
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,980
No,
I think you got to come up,

395
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:51,530
pick it up and I know you should get up
and they should move his boy.

396
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:53,020
You like you're royalty.
Yeah,

397
00:16:53,021 --> 00:16:54,050
I would love that.
That'd be right.

398
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,010
They come out and sell beer,
so I know how weird.

399
00:16:58,011 --> 00:17:00,830
It's so weird,
but it's so fucking good that brisket

400
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,480
melts in your mouth.
Like it's,

401
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,270
it's just like,
it's like cotton candy.

402
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:07,970
This is another place in Austin that
Aubrey swears by two,

403
00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:08,640
I don't remember.
Yeah,

404
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,340
he lives in Austin.
Yeah.

405
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:12,110
There's another place that he says is
just as good,

406
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,020
but it's not a scene.
Santa suit.

407
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,700
Well,
something that got popular got on TV,

408
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:18,320
right?
It got an Anthony Bourdain show.

409
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,510
Well,
he would trade with the other guy who

410
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:22,970
used to be the best guy in Austin.
This got trained with him,

411
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:25,220
got his own smoker.
It was just in a back parking lot.

412
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,840
That's what they do.
They go pack parking lot.

413
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:27,880
So the first time I went,
I just,

414
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,820
I looked for one,
I was like,

415
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,020
ah,
molars,

416
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,490
Mueller,
Mueller's barbecue.

417
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,190
And I went in there at like 1230,
no lines.

418
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,411
Like,
oh,

419
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:35,090
it was cool.
Great.

420
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:35,481
I was like,
Hey,

421
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:36,314
can I get some?
Uh,

422
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,480
and they're like,
what are you sold out of me in a long

423
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:39,290
time ago?
Signed,

424
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,340
you've got to get here early.
They sell at a meet at certain times.

425
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,820
At some point the line for Franklin to
go,

426
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,220
no more Turkey,
just so you guys know.

427
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,370
And then 10 minutes later,
no more prestigious.

428
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,080
And I'm like,
AH,

429
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,990
Fuck Jews.
They only have meat enough for that day.

430
00:17:51,991 --> 00:17:53,520
So by two,
they're closed.

431
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,260
Their dealers,
their dealers,

432
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,260
their dealers and getting you out it
creating a surplus.

433
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,300
They got a line of people.
Yeah.

434
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,410
It's,
it's amazing.

435
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,610
It's,
it's a cool,

436
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,780
but then they do like,
oh,

437
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:08,640
we got to where they had it.
So they had that smoker in the back

438
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:10,770
parking lot somewhere and then they had
to find a buyer place.

439
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,170
They literally have an over abundance of
buyers.

440
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,170
They have too much.
Yeah.

441
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,180
Like they,
they keep their business exactly as big

442
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:19,350
as it is,
but they haven't,

443
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,630
they haven't expanded.
Wow.

444
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,670
That's so rare.
Perfect.

445
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

446
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,820
It's so rare though,
right?

447
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,230
It's,
it's glorious.

448
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,050
It's very rare.
It's very,

449
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,250
just say something like,
Oh,

450
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,600
I'm just going to keep running this
business where I can keep my eye on

451
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:35,280
everything.
We can do it the right way.

452
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,590
They give you brisket in line,
like a Katz's Deli.

453
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,760
Oh really?
You know with the Pastrami,

454
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:39,740
they'll like taste this,
you know?

455
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,940
They walked by with some,
just as you get to the front,

456
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:44,490
they just cut you off some test,
which are about to order.

457
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,650
Oh,
that's good.

458
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,750
Yeah.
They did that to us in this place that

459
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:51,930
we went to.
Me And ben and Aubrey went to this

460
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,480
place.
It's about 40 minutes outside of Austin.

461
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,910
I forget the name of it.
Yeah.

462
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,110
I went there.
Yes.

463
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,710
You've been to.
That's what there with Metzger and a few

464
00:18:58,711 --> 00:19:02,010
of the people I met Scott in the last
brisket and we all had a fucking suck up

465
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:05,340
on some goddamn Turkey to hot legs,
peasant immigrants.

466
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,810
He didn't split the brisket with him.
No,

467
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:08,040
he did not.
Wow.

468
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,320
That's not a kind person.
He's selfish.

469
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,070
That's dark and he's taking his time.
There's three of you and you guys like

470
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,410
seven of us.
Okay.

471
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,350
Fuck them.
Yeah.

472
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,020
Yeah.
How many people?

473
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,530
You guys can all have a lick of one
bite.

474
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,290
The problem is you roll too deep.
Yeah,

475
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,130
because that's just too much brisket to
hang around.

476
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,090
All those different folks.
It's like,

477
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,870
sorry,
we should've gotten there earlier.

478
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,570
What I was getting to earlier was that,
think about that.

479
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:36,930
Who Guy,
that dash thing about how stupid that is

480
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,890
that this is in 2016 with the world that
we live in today,

481
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,010
these kind of morons are still making
decisions.

482
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,580
Some six year old girl got arrested for
stealing candy to put her in handcuffs.

483
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,160
See that six years old heard her
handcuffs,

484
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,380
scared straight stuff.
Had to be that no cop is going to look

485
00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:56,430
it up.
A girl.

486
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,010
I go like,
we really got to take her in.

487
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,600
I don't know,
but it wasn't a white girl for sure.

488
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:05,280
It wasn't,
obviously it wasn't a white car.

489
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:07,100
Isn't that,
I mean you,

490
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,570
could you even imagine that taking
college or not?

491
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:10,940
When a went to a white girl?
No,

492
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,440
that's crazy.
Young Lady Racist.

493
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,970
Oh yeah,
that's crazy.

494
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,500
Off the top racist.
Oh,

495
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:18,010
she's so cute.
Over the top races.

496
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,090
Chicago mom,
outrage after daughter's six placed in

497
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:24,570
handcuffs for taking candy,
taking any of the teachers that I

498
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:27,240
thought maybe there was some Persian guy
who was like,

499
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,040
no,
she stares.

500
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,620
You'll go that law.
And then I had to be like a restaurant

501
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,140
on arrest her.
But if it's off a teacher's desk,

502
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,110
we're trying to teach her a lesson.
It says,

503
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,510
yeah,
you're gonna wind up in jail.

504
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,220
What the fuck man?
That his crew,

505
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:45,900
so this is the world we're living in
today,

506
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,820
right?
This is how crazy some of the stories

507
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:51,880
are where this gets through somehow or
this becomes a real thing.

508
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:54,160
This actually happens.
And then we're all talking about it.

509
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:59,161
Like what in the fuck in imagine life
back when most people died at like 24

510
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,240
like everybody's dead.
Half the people that like your,

511
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,160
you give birth to half of them die.

512
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,450
They just don't make it.
Like when you were looking at the ages

513
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:13,150
of people that lived back in during the
Roman times,

514
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:14,750
I mean,
what is the end?

515
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,470
I think the infant mortality rate back
then was something insane,

516
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:20,200
like 40% or something like that.
This is what I don't,

517
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,940
I lose.
I lose what parents say.

518
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,940
Which you say I'm more angry than
anything because my only daughter,

519
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,620
I feel like anything could have happened
to her.

520
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,110
Somebody could have touched her.
She in the dark under the stairs,

521
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,540
but that's just ridiculous.
You know what that is?

522
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,950
That's someone that sees the finish
line.

523
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,730
You have no money.
Why?

524
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,990
Why would,
why would you think anyone's going to

525
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:37,720
touch her under the stairs at school?
Because she's scared.

526
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:38,171
I mean,
who knows?

527
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,910
She might not be that bright.
Who the fuck knows?

528
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,480
But she also was being interviewed so
she sees the finish line.

529
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:48,400
The finish line is you got to make this
traumatic as fuck to get that big paper.

530
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,730
She's getting some pig.
Oh,

531
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,540
she's trying to do that.
Oh fuck yeah,

532
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,400
she's Gunna Dude.
I mean,

533
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:59,350
if there's ever been a slam dunk case,
if I was an ambulance chaser or a one of

534
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:03,490
those asshole guys,
it looks to sue over nothing on this

535
00:22:03,491 --> 00:22:05,290
thing.
This one's crazy.

536
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,820
Can we talk to you real quick?
Yeah.

537
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,840
This one's fucking crazy.
You handcuffed to a six year old girl.

538
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,060
I got read to teach someone a lesson
though.

539
00:22:13,061 --> 00:22:15,730
I sort of get it on that level.
No Baker scare.

540
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,730
You don't steal.
We don't still know how to put kids in

541
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:19,810
chains.
Oh,

542
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:22,360
you had cheese.
Not you're just not.

543
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,790
You're definitely not allowed to do a
deal.

544
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,170
A little black kid because of the
connotations.

545
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,090
Yeah,
just can't do it.

546
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,450
You can't take a six year old and go,
this is what you're going to be.

547
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,240
So the teacher,
she's a little kid,

548
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:35,440
man.
Let me tell you something,

549
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:37,700
dude.
I've a teacher or a cop.

550
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,770
No one's fault.
It's part of being a kid.

551
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,980
Kids do stupid shit in the handcuffs.
The teacher who said,

552
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,140
oh,
whoever put the handcuffs on her for

553
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:50,380
sure is the culprit.
Whoever put the handcuffs on her,

554
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,250
whoever would a man that put that,
I assume it's a man who's cinched up

555
00:22:54,251 --> 00:22:56,020
those handcuffs around that six year old
risks.

556
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,940
Get the fuck Outta here.
They'll see.

557
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,390
First of all,
you should never be a cop for the rest

558
00:23:01,391 --> 00:23:05,320
of your life ever if you can't control a
six year old security guard,

559
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:06,280
but still,
okay.

560
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,120
Same thing.
Paul blart some Paul blart type

561
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:13,360
character.
If it's nonsense,

562
00:23:13,361 --> 00:23:13,811
man,
I still,

563
00:23:13,811 --> 00:23:14,261
my,
my,

564
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:17,110
uh,
my cousin's comb out of his desk,

565
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:20,180
Israel and my dad saw it cause we're,
where'd you get this call?

566
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:24,040
And had a cool pony picture on it,
on a cone was a Palomino.

567
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,880
And uh,
I was like,

568
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,550
Oh God,
he's quitting mean you don't have any

569
00:23:27,551 --> 00:23:29,760
money.
You don't get things other God,

570
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,110
you've got this fucking time,
man.

571
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:33,190
What are you talking about?
You've got it.

572
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,360
And I was like,
I got it from a,

573
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,300
he goes room.
He was like,

574
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,340
did he give it to?
And I was like,

575
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,090
no.
He found out I was going,

576
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,730
you got to go back there and tell him he
stole it.

577
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,840
And I was like,
aw man,

578
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,350
please do not make me do.
It's like,

579
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,213
yeah,
it don't want it.

580
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,820
I've got buses see on the top bar once.
Really?

581
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,570
Yeah.
I think I was 12 like 11 or 12 maybe

582
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,060
somewhere that age.
Who busted you?

583
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,550
Security.
Okay.

584
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,190
Security Guard at a store.
I put like a candy bar in my pocket or

585
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:01,650
something.

586
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,470
I've don't exactly remember how it went
down,

587
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,080
but I remember the guy grabbing me on my
shoulder.

588
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:07,970
I was like an slick about it,
you know,

589
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,460
really unsafe.
Lik I think it was probably 11.

590
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,080
They're already watching you and you
don't remember.

591
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,250
Um,
yeah,

592
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,980
it was fucking ridiculous.
And um,

593
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,130
and then they take in some rooms,
scare the shit out of here.

594
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,110
You know,
you ever do this again?

595
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:23,060
We're going to call the police.
We're going to let you go right now.

596
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,160
We're not going to tell your parents,
but if you ever do this again,

597
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:26,660
we will call the police,
try to scare you.

598
00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:28,070
Understand me.
And I was like,

599
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:29,090
Oh yeah,
I'm so sorry.

600
00:24:29,091 --> 00:24:31,340
I can't believe we did it.
And then I told my friends,

601
00:24:31,341 --> 00:24:32,121
they're like,
why'd you do it?

602
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:32,840
I'm like,
oh,

603
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,360
I don't even know.
I just wanted to see if I could do it.

604
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,340
I want a candy.
I didn't have any money.

605
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,250
Hey,
is this allowable?

606
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:39,981
And then you find out,
oh,

607
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:42,530
it's not.
I dated a girl in high school who's a

608
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:44,910
really bright girl.
Various,

609
00:24:44,911 --> 00:24:45,920
yes.
Wow.

610
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:48,500
She's very smart and educated and you
know,

611
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:51,200
did really well for herself and you
know,

612
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,190
wound up,
uh,

613
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:56,540
being an outstanding citizen.
But when she was in high school,

614
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:01,030
she had a problem like girls.
Well,

615
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,731
anybody,
you know,

616
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:04,100
you see things and you can't afford
them.

617
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,920
And when you're young,
you've never earned any money.

618
00:25:06,921 --> 00:25:08,270
Yeah.
You also,

619
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:11,450
you have,
you still have these lapses and thinking

620
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:15,770
that are intensely juvenile,
especially if you grew up in a weird,

621
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,730
like single parent household like she
did or like,

622
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,260
you know,
a lot of people do,

623
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,110
you know,
or Latchkey kids where,

624
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:25,700
you know,
your parents just go get out of here and

625
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:27,920
they just let you out the door and you
figure out life on your own.

626
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:32,950
That's a lot of fucking kids.
And so I think she just got caught doing

627
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:37,610
it and it was devastating.
She was pretty honest about it.

628
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,190
Like how devastating it was.
Yeah.

629
00:25:40,191 --> 00:25:41,710
She got caught with clothes,
you know,

630
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,730
she arrest security guard.
Yeah.

631
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:48,200
I guess what girls would do is we'll go
to a place and they would put clothes on

632
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:50,570
over their other clothes.
Go into the dressing room.

633
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,330
Yeah.
They'd go in the dressing room and like

634
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,190
hide stuff.
And this is like we're talking about,

635
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:00,490
I graduated in 1985 so I think is
probably like 83 or 84.

636
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:04,610
This is no computers.
Just know scanners on your items and you

637
00:26:04,611 --> 00:26:06,890
walk out the door and RFID card goes
off.

638
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,650
You know,
those things that they have at this on

639
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:11,260
an rf ID.
What are those plastic things like?

640
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,400
It looks like a stapler clip onto your
shirt,

641
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,700
but if you don't take them off the
personal glue to try to take them home,

642
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,530
I don't think they had that shit back
then.

643
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,360
I think you just had to keep an eye on
people.

644
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,200
Do you remember when,
um,

645
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,110
there was a famous actress that got
caught?

646
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,050
Yeah,
that's right.

647
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,180
She got caught being a club.
That's one of the reasons I know that

648
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,450
any like scandal that falls a comic,
like it'll pass.

649
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,940
No one talks about going to a writer
being a shoplifter anymore.

650
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,260
We just did.
Well,

651
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,094
yeah,
but I mean,

652
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,000
people don't really pick up on that way.
Thank God when not respectable.

653
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,040
I remember at some point learning the
lesson was like,

654
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,791
Oh,
I'm an adult now.

655
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:47,490
If I got caught shoplifting,
now I'm just going to go to jail.

656
00:26:47,491 --> 00:26:49,830
There's no like young man.
We'll talk to your parents.

657
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,440
I think people,
some people have just fucking lapses in

658
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:54,450
judgment and they do it because they're
like,

659
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:56,520
see,
I think subconsciously like someone,

660
00:26:56,521 --> 00:26:58,380
like we're known a rider who's obviously
wealthy,

661
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,750
she's wealthy.
I think she's like Pr.

662
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,790
I mean,
I'm just totally playing armchair

663
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:05,100
psychologist here,
but I would say,

664
00:27:05,101 --> 00:27:08,340
um,
it might seriously be that she's just

665
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:11,030
trying to charge up her day somehow.
Like subconscious,

666
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:14,460
the season,
the series premiere of our heroes,

667
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,660
the very first episode alert,
you're going to spoil her.

668
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,600
It again too.
That's fucking 12 years old,

669
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,100
bitch.
Anyway,

670
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:24,000
the fucking wife for the congressmen,
she gets caught shoplifting and people

671
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:24,960
go,
why don't you shop the,

672
00:27:24,961 --> 00:27:27,240
she goes,
I just needed to feel something.

673
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,690
It was the worst writing ever heard.
She was after Frank Dodd.

674
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,930
I just needed to feel good.
Christ.

675
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,461
Yeah,
but,

676
00:27:33,461 --> 00:27:35,670
uh,
did I steal from the airports all the

677
00:27:35,671 --> 00:27:37,410
time?
You used to or do,

678
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,790
do,
what'd he steal?

679
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,250
I don't know.
If I buy a couple things that,

680
00:27:40,251 --> 00:27:42,720
and they're super expensive.
The water is just coming with me for

681
00:27:42,721 --> 00:27:43,710
free.
Whoa.

682
00:27:43,711 --> 00:27:47,820
You shouldn't say this on the air.
What are they going to set up a sting

683
00:27:47,821 --> 00:27:51,160
you at the airport?
Like we wanted those things.

684
00:27:51,161 --> 00:27:52,250
It's just like,
or the banana.

685
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,273
I don't know.
Something.

686
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,670
Well,
why would you give a fuck you up?

687
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,530
Money.
Yeah,

688
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:58,890
because I just feel it's not justified
that they charged this much power with

689
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,150
that be oh,
Bernie Sanders all the way.

690
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,600
Every one.
Uh,

691
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,540
yeah.
I mean if I voted,

692
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,580
which I'm not,
but like I would do better if you vote

693
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:06,414
for sanders.

694
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,210
Um,
yeah,

695
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,420
it's not fair.
So stop it.

696
00:28:10,421 --> 00:28:15,300
I go wait for 75 for the regular size
water and that does look like,

697
00:28:15,301 --> 00:28:16,051
you know,
that's a lot,

698
00:28:16,051 --> 00:28:17,370
right?
Yeah.

699
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,390
It's not my,
I don't,

700
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,400
you know,
it's fairly expensive.

701
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:23,730
However,
how much would I have to pay you to go

702
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,530
get some water,
purify it,

703
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,200
cool it off,
put it in a plastic jar and have it

704
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:31,320
sealed and waiting for me.
Hundred $50.

705
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,390
Yeah,
it's cost based on that.

706
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,730
Did I got into a fight with a guy on the
Great Wall of China?

707
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,190
He was selling cater rates and I had
just taken this long hike or,

708
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:42,090
I mean it was hot,
I was sweaty and I saw gatorade and I

709
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:42,571
was like,
yeah,

710
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:43,890
how much?
And he was like,

711
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,330
I forget how much it was.
Let's say he was like 20 you know un

712
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,530
right.
And I was like,

713
00:28:49,531 --> 00:28:51,300
what do you mean the price is five bro,
you know,

714
00:28:51,301 --> 00:28:53,250
the price is five and he goes 20 I'm
like,

715
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,770
I'm not a fucking tourist.
I've been here for two weeks already.

716
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,110
I already know the scam.
And he goes,

717
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,470
I walked it up from the fucking bottom
of the hill all the way up to the Great

718
00:29:01,471 --> 00:29:03,270
Wall of China and I was like,
20 it is.

719
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,163
There you go.

720
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:06,630
Yeah,
man,

721
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,310
that's legit.
Yeah,

722
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:14,270
but it can't be stealing water
without the sup or if the line is too

723
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:17,310
long.
If the line is too long,

724
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,550
your own price.
If the line is too long,

725
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:21,050
I'm like,
I gotta go.

726
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:21,810
I was like,
ah,

727
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,040
Nah,
I'm just going to walk.

728
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,100
Sometimes I do that.
Sometimes you just take things.

729
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,570
Yeah.
Need pillows once in a while.

730
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,980
Really I,
I'm going to wait in the line.

731
00:29:28,981 --> 00:29:30,960
I'm walking around looking for nuts.
I have a neck pillow.

732
00:29:30,961 --> 00:29:32,580
It's on my suitcase now.
I put it on there.

733
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,670
I'm like,
no,

734
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,750
I'd probably just go,
this is not a good way to think.

735
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:37,980
Oh,
for sure.

736
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,620
This is a crime.
You're talking about steady crime,

737
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,440
whatever the what the American
government says I should do.

738
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:47,230
I don't agree with all that.
I don't think the government owns those

739
00:29:47,231 --> 00:29:48,810
little stops at the airport.
No,

740
00:29:48,811 --> 00:29:49,060
no,
no.

741
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,310
I'm saying what they say in terms of
stealing and not stealing.

742
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,650
I just don't listen to him laws.
Yeah.

743
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,020
Hmm.
But few corporations,

744
00:29:56,021 --> 00:29:57,880
fuck them.
Steal what you want.

745
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,890
Apple,
what is a big corporation like?

746
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,250
Are those big corporations that have
those little stalls in them in the

747
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,740
airport?
I don't do it from the kiosks,

748
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,120
although I would do it from the Kia.
I just harder because you can't walk

749
00:30:10,121 --> 00:30:11,450
around.
There's one guy looking,

750
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,750
but that doesn't make any sense.
Why are you doing that?

751
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,160
I don't know.
Good question.

752
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,890
Let me think about that.
This is something that could cause you a

753
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:20,470
giant problem if you've got yeah,
for sure.

754
00:30:20,471 --> 00:30:21,304
I'd miss my flight.

755
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,780
Well,
not just miss your flight.

756
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,820
It would be a big deal.
I mean,

757
00:30:24,821 --> 00:30:27,070
you could always plead it.
Not Anymore.

758
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,350
Not because of this.
Cause these evidence of this.

759
00:30:29,351 --> 00:30:32,170
This is how much time I had a Koosh ball
at chesapeake knife and tool and I was

760
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:33,580
tossing around,
but I was looking at all the little

761
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,320
metal games.
You know those puzzle games,

762
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:39,040
you'd get the ring off and I was like,
oh I can easily take this right now.

763
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,260
And I just kept tossing it up and walked
right out of the store.

764
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:42,880
Cause if they caught me I'd be like,
Oh my God,

765
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:45,640
I'm so sorry.
Oh clearly I wasn't clearly.

766
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,280
I mean that was in high school.
You should go back and give it back to

767
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:49,580
them.
I want to go back to places I stole the

768
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,160
candy bar and pay for it.
Really?

769
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,250
No,
you've got to pay it for like five with

770
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:55,084
interests.

771
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,920
Oh my God.
You don't them found what kind of candy

772
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,300
bar?
I don't remember.

773
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,760
It's like a Hershey's bar or something.
Nothing exotic.

774
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,610
That's on you,
Tommy.

775
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,910
Yeah,
I've been a zero bar.

776
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:05,140
Maybe.
I don't remember.

777
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:08,410
10,000 grand I just made it was candy
fucking Hershey Bar.

778
00:31:08,411 --> 00:31:12,880
What are you go fucking fried internment
camp guy from the fucking Japanese war.

779
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,100
Let me tell you something.
Chocolate Hershey's chocolate with

780
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:18,160
almonds still to this day is fucking
bang up.

781
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:23,500
This like charge America,
Hershey's chocolate and Jif peanut

782
00:31:23,501 --> 00:31:24,530
butter.
This is what he's good.

783
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:28,630
That's good to break off the fucking
pieces of the Hershey's chocolate with

784
00:31:28,631 --> 00:31:32,740
almonds and dig into a big Vat of Jif
peanut butter cup

785
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:37,280
or skippy.
You want to get crazy nutty ones.

786
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:42,370
I one they try to sell us that bullshit.
Where was a stripe of jelly and a stripe

787
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,810
peanut butter and a stripe.

788
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,330
Fuck you.
Unless you're eating with a spoon

789
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:48,460
straight out of the jar into your mouth.
It's like,

790
00:31:48,461 --> 00:31:50,200
no,
I decide how much jelly and how much

791
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:52,070
peanut burgos goes on it.
This is stupid dude.

792
00:31:52,071 --> 00:31:53,680
We were having a party for uh,
for,

793
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:56,350
this is not happening for my show.
Every Tuesday night,

794
00:31:56,351 --> 00:31:59,800
12:30 AM class control,
three episodes left.

795
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:01,060
He has his company.
But anyway,

796
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,580
so we had s'mores.
We hit in the back of Eric and Sam's

797
00:32:03,581 --> 00:32:04,600
place.
It was a little fire pit.

798
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:06,460
We had smores and rock.
I just burned him.

799
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,790
I just burned the mushroom,
not mushroom marshmallow and stick it on

800
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:11,730
there and smash and then skype Brian
Ball the,

801
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,550
and he's like,
dude,

802
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,310
I was a cub scout for 12 years.
It's not how you'd do it.

803
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,283
Oh,
let me show you.

804
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,470
And for the next 10 minutes,
he perfectly browned this marshmallow

805
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:23,710
from like eight feet above the fire,
like just made it so long.

806
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:24,544
And then he turns,
he goes,

807
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,050
see now this is,
I got a slap.

808
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:31,490
Don't have to the ground.
So

809
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:39,670
I was waiting for him to finish.
Uh,

810
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:44,870
he's the Franklins of
Oh my God.

811
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,280
That's hilarious dude.
You just shit on the Franklin Morris

812
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,350
People's heads.
I did it out of Gomez and he had an owl

813
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:57,260
towards tim that was open for so long.
I'm like,

814
00:32:57,261 --> 00:32:58,540
why are you leaving?
You're making,

815
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,880
I don't want to do this to you.
You're forcing my hand.

816
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:06,320
And then you just slapped it up and he
goes to this please in in there.

817
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,520
The seller,
I know that we can look on the ground.

818
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,570
We found a lot of them.

819
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:19,280
It's so much fun to slap food out.
Someone said Josh Martin did that.

820
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:22,760
He was coming out of the back with a
fucking pretzel all cover with my

821
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:27,380
master's.
It's only great when they can easily

822
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:28,760
replace it.
Yes.

823
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:31,130
So you've got to get him five bucks.
Go deal with it.

824
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,410
If I ever got a lot of money,
I would smash people's I phones and just

825
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:36,680
stomp on them like,
here's $700 but then what if they're in

826
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,420
the middle of like a really important
conversation,

827
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,250
right?
Babysitter.

828
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,160
Yeah.
Now you get it.

829
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,070
Anyway,
Josh Martin comes out.

830
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:44,210
I just slapped that.
He goes,

831
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,920
oh,
and I could see he's looking at like,

832
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:46,780
maybe like,
anyway,

833
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,680
I'm like,
you're making me step on this man.

834
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,420
You're making me step on as you're
leaving me.

835
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:55,421
No choice.
Why comics so mean to each other.

836
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,440
It was so cool.
So mean to each other.

837
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,770
There was one of the funny stories,
stories I'll have to,

838
00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:03,590
it was Louie and Norton.
Norton was talking about how he's

839
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:05,240
walking on the street with his slice of
pizza.

840
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:06,690
You just got it.
It was perfect,

841
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,620
was like,
it was such a juicy slight and Louie

842
00:34:09,621 --> 00:34:13,510
walked over and smacked it,
ran out of his hand and says something

843
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,590
like,
your mother is a kind of

844
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,073
like,
oh,

845
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,070
why is that so funny?
So funny.

846
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,180
It's like,
it's,

847
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:29,780
but it's only pain associated with no
real monetary loss.

848
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,170
It's not real.
You're like,

849
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,260
no.
That's why the cell phone doesn't work.

850
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,060
It's on.
It's real.

851
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:37,370
It's a real phone.
You'd have to give them like a grand.

852
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,620
Yeah.
It's not a slice of pizza that you just

853
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,530
easily replace.

854
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,310
Instead of the how comedians are cruel,
they are to each other.

855
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,560
He was like,
if you break up with a girl,

856
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,750
if you're the comedy store and you break
up with a girl,

857
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:53,480
you just don't tell anyone for like
eight months.

858
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,240
It's just they're not going to be cool
to you.

859
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,081
They're not going to say,
it's okay,

860
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:58,700
man.
They're just gonna be like,

861
00:34:58,701 --> 00:35:00,820
who are you think's fucking her?
No.

862
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,180
Do you think she's fine?
Finally trying anal.

863
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,620
Oh,
that's true.

864
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,300
Yeah.
You just don't tell anybody until you're

865
00:35:05,301 --> 00:35:06,230
over it and you're like,
okay,

866
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:07,180
now I can.
Okay.

867
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

868
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,700
That ended a year ago.
What?

869
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,150
What can we still make fun of you?
Yeah,

870
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:13,670
but it won't stick anymore.
Before it had two girlfriends since

871
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:15,110
then.
That's a lot of guys.

872
00:35:15,111 --> 00:35:16,700
You've employed that strategy.
What?

873
00:35:16,701 --> 00:35:17,540
Not telling anybody.
Yeah.

874
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,470
Oh yeah,
for sure.

875
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,910
Yeah.
I remember I'd be like,

876
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:20,720
where's,
what's her name?

877
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,553
Yeah.
It didn't work out.

878
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:27,700
I don't want to look at you.
Look one of your best friends a fucking

879
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,543
year,
Bro.

880
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:32,360
Got to keep that take
a year.

881
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,280
I was going to tell you,
I was going to tell you a bunch of Lee.

882
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,880
I Dunno man.
It'd been,

883
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:43,050
it has to be someone you like.
Like if someone that you didn't like as

884
00:35:43,051 --> 00:35:46,160
a comedian came by and slapped your tic
tacs.

885
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,101
Oh yeah.
Then it's like,

886
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:48,630
who the fuck are you?
Exactly.

887
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,300
It only works if you really liked that
person.

888
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,720
Like I Rocco.
Yeah,

889
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,180
Rocco.
He's a nice guy,

890
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,990
but I didn't know him that well and I
yawned and he put his fucking two

891
00:35:57,991 --> 00:35:59,330
fingers right in my mouth.
I'm like,

892
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,220
don't you don't fucking ever do that to
me again.

893
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,730
I was so mad.
But if you do it,

894
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,573
I'm like,
oh dude,

895
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,560
fucking gross.
That'd be the end of it.

896
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,480
But why would anybody do that?
I don't know.

897
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,520
I definitely don't want your hands with
my mouth and I didn't want my hands in

898
00:36:14,521 --> 00:36:17,340
your mouth either.
What if someone's got some crazy gag

899
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,570
reflex?
Just chomps down.

900
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,850
That would be hilarious.
Sip.

901
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:21,690
You're like,
let me teach you.

902
00:36:21,691 --> 00:36:23,570
I left it.
I may just barfs all over your are

903
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:27,180
bites.
You shoot it like a human bite is super

904
00:36:27,181 --> 00:36:28,600
dangerous or like when,
yeah,

905
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:31,860
when Pete people have all sorts of funky
fucking bacteria in their mouth.

906
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,860
When a person bites you,
like if you get infected,

907
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:36,330
if you can get it cleaned up really
good,

908
00:36:36,331 --> 00:36:37,860
really quick.
Yeah,

909
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:39,380
we're nasty.
It'll do shit to,

910
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,460
people get real sick.
They get real sick.

911
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,160
Well diseases that come from bites can
be particularly fucked up.

912
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:50,040
Like that's one of the things about
those Goddamn Komodo dragons.

913
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,630
I'm pretty sure checking C in this cause
I might be mistaken,

914
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,780
but I'm pretty sure they used to think
that they have venom.

915
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:01,020
They used to think they produce a venom
and now they,

916
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:05,310
or it might be the other way around that
they used to think that it was just

917
00:37:05,311 --> 00:37:10,230
bacteria in their mouth that killed just
fucking slime.

918
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:13,740
Their mouth develops a slime.
The really weird,

919
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,620
the Komodo dragons there,
their mouth is like,

920
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:19,380
like someone just blew snot in their
mouth.

921
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,210
Like they open their mouth up and it's
like,

922
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,260
like you,
if you just sneeze,

923
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,430
if you had the flu and fucking goos
coming out of your mouth,

924
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,493
one,
two punch.

925
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,750
They have sharp teeth and a venomous
bite.

926
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,780
Okay.
Dispels the common belief that toxic

927
00:37:33,781 --> 00:37:36,120
bacteria in the commodos mouse are
responsible.

928
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:39,420
So that's the old belief.
So she wins her worse than Komodo

929
00:37:39,421 --> 00:37:40,254
dragons.
Yeah.

930
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:43,200
Well,
if it probably kill you eventually,

931
00:37:43,201 --> 00:37:45,630
if they bit you,
I'm sure this fucking nasty shit in

932
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:47,550
their mouth,
but the venom,

933
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,850
they actually have a venom,
but for the longest time they thought

934
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:53,790
that it was just bacteria.
Because like show a picture of a Komodo

935
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:57,090
dragon with its mouth open.
It's fucking vile,

936
00:37:57,091 --> 00:37:59,340
man.
I want to see one of those Komodo

937
00:37:59,341 --> 00:38:00,174
island.

938
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,790
It's only one place where they looked
at.

939
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,540
Yeah.
Wow.

940
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,940
They don't have them in zoos and you
sure what do they definitely do,

941
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,980
but I mean one place where they exist in
the wild.

942
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,540
Yeah,
I'm pretty sure.

943
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,800
Pretty sure.
It's only one area.

944
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,800
Like look at his mouth.
That slime.

945
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,110
Yeah.
The whole thing is just slimes Ville and

946
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:18,970
apparently that shit's all toxic.
Oh,

947
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,930
pass those pretty fast right there.
They'll come at you.

948
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,080
They're fucking big man.
These things eat water buffaloes and

949
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:26,130
shit.
No Way.

950
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,900
Yeah.
They bite him and then they follow him

951
00:38:27,901 --> 00:38:30,960
for days until they die and then date
them.

952
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:36,030
They are the creepiest of the creeps.
Got fucking bulldog.

953
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,900
They're so disgusting.
I mean,

954
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:40,390
they're beautiful in a lot of ways.
I mean,

955
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,970
there,
there's a spectacular example source.

956
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,940
Oh yeah.
I mean they are dinosaurs,

957
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:47,200
man.
Look at that one right there that you

958
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:48,660
just passed over.
Jamie said.

959
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,980
Yeah,
look at that fucking thing.

960
00:38:50,981 --> 00:38:52,470
Go full screen on that.
What?

961
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,830
In the law?
Sharp claws.

962
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:58,510
And it's built like a pit bull.
It's got giant muscles everywhere

963
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:01,540
almost.
They're so gross.

964
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,960
Or let me see it.
Eating a waterproof.

965
00:39:02,961 --> 00:39:04,450
I want to see how big it is and scale.
Well,

966
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:07,270
what they do is they ran up to a,
there's a video of,

967
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:10,000
um,
a Kimono dragon running up to this water

968
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,470
buffalo and biting its leg and then it
follows it for days.

969
00:39:14,471 --> 00:39:16,000
Look at that one.
It's often dolphin,

970
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,290
a beach dolphin.
A beach stouffer.

971
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,300
Yeah.
Probably died.

972
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,890
And they're eating it after it died.

973
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:21,641
Oh,
so much.

974
00:39:21,641 --> 00:39:24,250
That happens a lot with bears.
It's like there's a cow that ones

975
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,590
because they're eating the head off FAA.
Yeah.

976
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,100
Their moms are pretty big.
Okay.

977
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:29,170
They're pretty big.
Oh yeah.

978
00:39:29,171 --> 00:39:32,020
There are hundreds of pounds there.
The biggest lizards in the world.

979
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:32,651
Really?
Yeah.

980
00:39:32,651 --> 00:39:33,760
I don't know how,
I mean,

981
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:35,850
I think they probably get to like 800
pounds or something like that.

982
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:40,360
Like find out how big they are.
And Jamie has a Komodo dragon fight.

983
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:44,620
Well that's what happened to Sharon
stone's husband.

984
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,530
What?
Sharon stone's husband is this like

985
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,800
swash buckling journalism type
character.

986
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:53,360
He does like a lot of crazy stuff and
uh,

987
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,080
yeah.
Or I guess she's not married to him.

988
00:39:55,081 --> 00:39:55,881
I knew I,
what do I got?

989
00:39:55,881 --> 00:39:57,040
Some magazine.
Okay.

990
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,580
But,
but this guy who was like his real macho

991
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:02,920
guy and a deal,
a lot of macho type shit.

992
00:40:02,921 --> 00:40:06,100
And one of the things they did was he
got into some,

993
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,410
a cage with a Komodo Dragon.

994
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,230
Then they took,
he took his shoes off for whatever

995
00:40:11,231 --> 00:40:11,861
reason.
Like,

996
00:40:11,861 --> 00:40:15,430
maybe take your shoes off so that you
don't step in their habitat with,

997
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:19,120
you know what might possibly be on your
shoes cage with him.

998
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,880
Yeah.
And the fucking thing bid his foot

999
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:26,260
because he thought it thought his foot
was a rabbit cause its foot was white

1000
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,040
and they feed them rabbits.
Jesus fucking Christ.

1001
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,510
So this thing,
imagine that.

1002
00:40:31,511 --> 00:40:34,840
Think clamping down on your foot with
that slime mouth.

1003
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:37,300
He almost lost his foot.
Really?

1004
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,163
Yeah,
they go.

1005
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,150
Okay.
They're a lot smarter than I thought to

1006
00:40:40,151 --> 00:40:43,570
melt one 70 to 200 pounds.
I thought there were like eight or 900

1007
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:46,410
pounds reaching 10 feet.
10 feet in length.

1008
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,160
Jesus.
200 pounds.

1009
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,610
300 pounds.
But animals.

1010
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:55,030
Huh?
Reaching 10 feet and more than 300

1011
00:40:55,031 --> 00:40:58,840
pounds says this.
This is National Geographic to huh.

1012
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,130
Maybe that's as big as it can get you.

1013
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,560
It's not like to get him on a scale.
Right.

1014
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,370
Food with 30 pounds.
Okay.

1015
00:41:06,371 --> 00:41:08,170
What does a lot of,
either way,

1016
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,950
they're big nonfat it's more research to
be done.

1017
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,410
What's Kinda interesting is they're the
biggest lizards.

1018
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,780
Yeah.
So I guess a crocodile is not a lizard.

1019
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:22,320
I bet the way bigger crocodiles are way
bigger crocodiles.

1020
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,620
Not a lizard.
No,

1021
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,860
I guess it's not.
Cause if that's the biggest lizard,

1022
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:31,240
maybe there's a separate genus.
Is Crocodile Lizard Janice or genius.

1023
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:33,500
Genius.
Genius for um,

1024
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,680
for alligators and crocodiles,
they might be their own thing.

1025
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:41,730
Oh maybe I'm not lizards.
Well there's so much bigger than that.

1026
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,450
The Komodo dragon cannot be the biggest
lizard.

1027
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:48,230
Cause crocodiles like Niall crocs are
fucking giant.

1028
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:49,910
How big are those?
They're huge.

1029
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:52,670
The biggest ones,
I think they've ever recorded like 28

1030
00:41:52,671 --> 00:41:55,300
feet long.
Well pretty sure it cocktails for sure.

1031
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,360
Lizard.
Yeah,

1032
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:59,450
it seems like it would be right.
But then how are they saying that the

1033
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:01,310
Komodo dragons,
the largest lizard in the world?

1034
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,330
I don't know that it is it when I typed
it in,

1035
00:42:04,331 --> 00:42:06,850
something like that.
I see it's like largest species found on

1036
00:42:06,851 --> 00:42:10,020
the Indonesian islands.
Oh that's not like there's a couple.

1037
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,970
Yeah,
I swear I read that.

1038
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:15,190
That's the largest lizard in the world.
Maybe it was.

1039
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:16,950
Maybe they meant the largest monitor,

1040
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:20,160
monitor,
Lizard Family Var and I,

1041
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:22,410
it is largest living species of lizard.

1042
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:25,700
Okay,
so it was the largest species of

1043
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,543
lizards.
Yeah.

1044
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:29,840
So what does that mean?
The largest species monitor.

1045
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:30,703
Oh,
the largest

1046
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,130
volume.
Okay,

1047
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,050
okay.
That makes sense.

1048
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,420
But what the fuck's crocodile?
Is it a lizard?

1049
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,400
But I've made,
they have other stuff in the species.

1050
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,293
Yeah,
it's smaller,

1051
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:43,130
right?
Well there's a gang of different

1052
00:42:43,131 --> 00:42:44,640
monitors is what it is.
Right.

1053
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:49,800
Did you ever see a crocodile monitor?
Their fucking bad ass know how to

1054
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,380
monitor?
Does that mean monitor?

1055
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:55,550
It's a type of Lizard,
but a crocodile monitor is like these

1056
00:42:55,551 --> 00:43:00,551
really cryptic looking creepy fucking,
I think Eddie Bravo knew a girl had one

1057
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:02,270
as a pet.
I'd one.

1058
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,530
Yeah,
like one of those crazy goth chicks like

1059
00:43:06,531 --> 00:43:07,191
snakes.
You know what?

1060
00:43:07,191 --> 00:43:12,100
I don't like dogs.
So I'll get a lizard crocodile Mont.

1061
00:43:12,101 --> 00:43:15,150
You like dogs.
Why would you get a fucking crowd?

1062
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,380
You're in character.
Got The eyeballs and that thing looks

1063
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:19,130
like it's animated.

1064
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,420
That doesn't even look like a real
eyeball.

1065
00:43:20,421 --> 00:43:22,180
Right.
It looks like a dinosaur for sure.

1066
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:27,320
Yeah.
I'll take it.

1067
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:31,400
Everyone.
Andy Circus was a giant name because he

1068
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:35,090
did that play by play for a Gollum.
No,

1069
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,670
put things on him.
I Dunno who that is.

1070
00:43:37,671 --> 00:43:41,490
What are you talking call up in the
hobby and the hobbit movies really knew

1071
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,141
who he was.
Yeah.

1072
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:43,910
Then he did like a,
just a bunch of stuff like that.

1073
00:43:43,911 --> 00:43:46,580
When they put those things all over you
and they had to like act like,

1074
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,210
oh,
well he's a very good physical actor.

1075
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,440
If that was his body and that he was
moving around like that.

1076
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,580
He was a great gollum like,
and what they did with him.

1077
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,160
Just good though.
He was really solid.

1078
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,120
It was me.
That was great.

1079
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,150
No,
that was a,

1080
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,910
that was a great part of that.
Did you read the Hobbit?

1081
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,100
Did you ever do?
Yeah,

1082
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,830
I mean,
I think he was as good as you could've

1083
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:05,660
been.
Yeah.

1084
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:06,493
No.
Yeah,

1085
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,440
totally believable.
We're that CGI.

1086
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,680
Even though you kind of know you're
watching a cartoon,

1087
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,880
you know,
you kind of get it.

1088
00:44:13,881 --> 00:44:16,280
But he also aged unnaturally for a
thousand years,

1089
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:17,930
so it's not like he's supposed to be a
regular.

1090
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,040
Right,
right.

1091
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:21,470
You know thing the hobbit was such dog
shit.

1092
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,900
How dare you.
The Lord of the rings is amazing.

1093
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:27,260
How dare you on all accounts.
You thought the Lord of the rings was

1094
00:44:27,261 --> 00:44:28,400
not as good as the hobbit?
No,

1095
00:44:28,401 --> 00:44:30,590
no.
I don't remember which ones were which

1096
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,070
names,
but I liked all of them.

1097
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:32,940
Oh,
really?

1098
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:37,320
Didn't like all of them equally,
but they're were all good enough and one

1099
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:39,420
of them was like to set up some other
shit.

1100
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,740
Like sometimes they do a lot of that.

1101
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,450
Lord of the rings was three and those
were all great.

1102
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:43,471
Yeah,
the Hobbit,

1103
00:44:43,471 --> 00:44:46,320
they turned into three.
I don't know why.

1104
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,980
I mean,
I know why the smile,

1105
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:51,760
desolation of smile.
You didn't like the punch a talk at

1106
00:44:51,761 --> 00:44:53,190
like,
we need to join this battle.

1107
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,230
I don't want to go to the bat.
We need you.

1108
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,230
Alright.
And I fucking 20 minutes of that,

1109
00:44:58,770 --> 00:44:59,341
Jamie.
You know,

1110
00:44:59,341 --> 00:45:02,440
I'm right on that.
I didn't watch any of those works.

1111
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:05,480
They didn't freak you out in the fucking
Lord,

1112
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:08,130
Lord of the rings.
They didn't freak you out in the most

1113
00:45:08,131 --> 00:45:09,080
recent one.
No,

1114
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:13,590
they seem like Fango plus they were kind
of easy to kill this time.

1115
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,650
It's super easy to kill when fucking
bill kill it or cause I'm like,

1116
00:45:16,651 --> 00:45:18,400
wait,
how would at 1.0 they,

1117
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:21,750
these fucking evil super villains that
are created in a lab and then the next

1118
00:45:21,751 --> 00:45:23,070
point,
the fucking little hobbit with no

1119
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:23,904
training can get them.

1120
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:25,110
Oh,
that's a good point.

1121
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,770
That was one scene when they're in the
barrels going down the river,

1122
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:32,640
spoiler alert and I'm like,
he can't just kill everybody.

1123
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:33,620
You can't,
you know,

1124
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,340
in the barrels,
you guys aren't losing anybody.

1125
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:36,450
Nobody,
you know,

1126
00:45:36,451 --> 00:45:38,220
lose anybody.
Not No casualties.

1127
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:41,820
ORCS with bows and arrows jumping off a
fucking cliff is falling apart with the

1128
00:45:41,821 --> 00:45:44,080
two mountains were fighting and they're
jumping from thing to thing.

1129
00:45:44,081 --> 00:45:45,690
All fine.
Everybody's fine.

1130
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:52,550
It can be done in a way that would make
you think that although there's magic in

1131
00:45:53,911 --> 00:45:56,910
this world that they live in,
the physics of the regular world still

1132
00:45:56,911 --> 00:45:58,040
apply.
You got to shoot it,

1133
00:45:58,041 --> 00:45:58,874
right?
Yeah.

1134
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:01,680
That seat,
the problem is in these movies,

1135
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:05,190
it's not just the magic that you have to
concede.

1136
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,590
You have to concede that that's the
world they set up.

1137
00:46:07,591 --> 00:46:08,424
It's okay.
Yeah,

1138
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:09,240
you set up this world,
it's fine.

1139
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,980
Right.
Spiderman can shoot things cause they

1140
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:12,240
said at the world,
but he can't fly,

1141
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,020
but the physics of their movements,
like what happens,

1142
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,420
how they battle these orcs.
Yeah.

1143
00:46:18,421 --> 00:46:19,890
Gravity supposed to be normal.
Yeah.

1144
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,930
Yeah.
It doesn't make any sense and you can't

1145
00:46:21,931 --> 00:46:25,410
just constantly almost die and keep
going.

1146
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,030
It's like how to build,
we'll get away.

1147
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:27,721
Well,
he's got a ring.

1148
00:46:27,721 --> 00:46:28,860
It touches me invisible.
Okay,

1149
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,350
that works,
but you can't just like fucking fuck it

1150
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:35,580
holes and when people almost die and
then almost dying and almost dying

1151
00:46:35,581 --> 00:46:38,260
almost island,
you burn out my almost die nerve.

1152
00:46:38,261 --> 00:46:39,180
I don't care.
I don't,

1153
00:46:39,181 --> 00:46:41,070
I don't believe you are in danger.
Yeah.

1154
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,070
That happens in movies sometimes.
It's just a bunch of shit happening.

1155
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,370
I have this theory that most artists
have about a seven.

1156
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:52,260
I'm tweaking the years but about how its
seven year prime where they're really on

1157
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:55,560
point and Peter Jackson is that who did
the Lord of the rings in the habit?

1158
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,670
Yeah.
Like he was,

1159
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,880
that was amazing.
And then King Kong came and you're like

1160
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,260
oh maybe.
And then the hobbit.

1161
00:47:01,261 --> 00:47:02,870
It's a Dario.
You don't really,

1162
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:06,300
how dare you karody anymore.
King Kong was awesome.

1163
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:07,860
So socket,
same thing.

1164
00:47:07,861 --> 00:47:09,750
They'll brontosaurs are going all around
them.

1165
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,140
Fucking stopping right next to him.
Like Google.

1166
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,450
That was a close one.
Yeah.

1167
00:47:12,451 --> 00:47:14,490
Well I felt like it weighed about
Jurassic Park,

1168
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,220
the new Jurassic Park and watch.
And I was like okay here it comes.

1169
00:47:17,221 --> 00:47:20,460
More stuff happening and bunch of
stuff's gonna happen now and this is

1170
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:24,720
going to happen and it's just a bunch of
shit that like I have zero connection

1171
00:47:24,721 --> 00:47:27,450
to.
It's undeniably visually impressive.

1172
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,290
It's amazing.
Special effects.

1173
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:32,080
I have zero emotions.
It's all part of it.

1174
00:47:32,081 --> 00:47:34,570
You've got to draw me in and the people
will go like,

1175
00:47:34,571 --> 00:47:35,470
well why?
He said,

1176
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,790
that's why I did it because of this and
like,

1177
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,010
ah,
whatever saying it's not showing it.

1178
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,030
I hate to bring this movie you again,
but I,

1179
00:47:41,031 --> 00:47:42,880
I bring it up a lot.
Uh,

1180
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,830
x Makena oh yeah.
I just watched it.

1181
00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:48,220
I just saw her a few example.
Just saw it like there's just amount of

1182
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:50,620
Shit,
enough amount of shit happening.

1183
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,940
Like spectacular spellbound,
spellbound,

1184
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,300
spellbinding instead of word
spellbinding

1185
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,280
cliffhanging like you're fucking
nervous.

1186
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,800
What's going to happen?
Massive anticipation.

1187
00:48:02,801 --> 00:48:05,680
There's all sorts of different elements
at play.

1188
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:10,570
You've got artificial intelligence.
It's perhaps plotting against you and

1189
00:48:10,571 --> 00:48:12,160
there's so much going on,
man.

1190
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,170
And there's scenes in that movie.
Were you like,

1191
00:48:14,171 --> 00:48:14,711
fuck,
fuck,

1192
00:48:14,711 --> 00:48:16,510
fuck.
Like you're white knuckling.

1193
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:20,250
I didn't feel any of that in lecture
rassic part.

1194
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:20,681
Oh,
right,

1195
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:21,460
right,
right.

1196
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,540
I just didn't feel it.
I was like,

1197
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,650
they're going to be fine.
They're going to be coming up with an ex

1198
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:28,450
mackinaw where it's like,
do a better job.

1199
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:31,450
It really like what the weight falls in
love in a week.

1200
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:31,931
It's like,
Eh,

1201
00:48:31,931 --> 00:48:35,800
make it a month to you.
And I know guys who fall in love in an

1202
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,780
hour.
Yeah.

1203
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:39,160
Come on man.
A robot that hot.

1204
00:48:39,161 --> 00:48:40,750
You don't think Duncan would go under
quick?

1205
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,470
Jonathan would be gone by the end of the
first.

1206
00:48:44,471 --> 00:48:47,810
Hey Dude,
it's a new form of life duty.

1207
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,270
She's,
I love her man.

1208
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:53,200
I love her.
I'll come on dude.

1209
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,360
Once she's got the skin on and the skin
is indistinguishable from your,

1210
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,450
your skin,
you're not going to give a fuck about

1211
00:48:58,451 --> 00:49:01,840
that carbon fiber body that looks like
the inside of one of those.

1212
00:49:01,841 --> 00:49:03,700
I mean it was just like,
it was one of those things where mostly

1213
00:49:03,701 --> 00:49:05,190
it was like,
it was like he wasn't love at all.

1214
00:49:05,191 --> 00:49:06,190
He's like,
you're a robot euro,

1215
00:49:06,191 --> 00:49:08,200
but then all of a sudden it's like,
I'm a failure in love with you.

1216
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,330
I didn't see the,
the,

1217
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,700
the change in him.
I saw it coming.

1218
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,970
I saw it the moment I saw that guy sit
down with her.

1219
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,490
I saw coming too.
So I have to see it happen.

1220
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,360
I can't just be like,
oh,

1221
00:49:19,361 --> 00:49:20,620
you know,
so obviously falls in love.

1222
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,870
Well obviously he gets access to all my
computers.

1223
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,440
How does it work with people?
What,

1224
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,650
how does it work with people,
with people you never know.

1225
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:31,030
Like people get when people,
when some people get,

1226
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:35,350
we all have friends that have gone in
these relationships where they just go

1227
00:49:35,351 --> 00:49:36,310
away,
they're gone.

1228
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:38,590
I know,
but he liked me like three times and

1229
00:49:38,591 --> 00:49:39,520
then it was like,
Nah,

1230
00:49:39,521 --> 00:49:41,410
I'm willing to.
Yeah,

1231
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:45,610
but it doesn't matter man.
If he decided at some point in time that

1232
00:49:45,611 --> 00:49:48,820
this is like a form of life and that he
really has a real connection with her,

1233
00:49:48,821 --> 00:49:49,720
she really is intelligent.

1234
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,450
I mean he keep getting feedback from her
over and over again,

1235
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:57,070
but I'm saying show that you don't think
they showed that that was,

1236
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:57,821
it was,
it was a leap.

1237
00:49:57,821 --> 00:49:59,680
I still really enjoyed the movie.
It's still really,

1238
00:49:59,681 --> 00:50:00,700
really enjoyed it.
But no,

1239
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:02,170
they didn't really show it.
It just kind of,

1240
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:03,063
hmm.
They were like,

1241
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:03,903
Eh,
you know,

1242
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,240
maybe you got a point.
Like maybe they could have added a bit

1243
00:50:07,241 --> 00:50:09,460
more to that because of you draw me in
emotionally.

1244
00:50:09,461 --> 00:50:14,200
If I feel the falling in love right,
then I'm going to guess you should be

1245
00:50:14,201 --> 00:50:15,130
free.
See,

1246
00:50:15,131 --> 00:50:18,310
I just saw it from like a predatory
point of view.

1247
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,810
I go,
here's a wounding,

1248
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,120
wounded antelope.
Here's a waterhole,

1249
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:24,340
here's a crocodile.
How much it's going to get them.

1250
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,290
She's going to get go.
She's hot as fuck.

1251
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:29,480
She's hot as fuck.
He's a super dork who's never around

1252
00:50:29,481 --> 00:50:29,960
women.

1253
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,460
Yeah.
I don't care if she's a robot.

1254
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:34,010
That dude was so great too at the bail.
He was great.

1255
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,230
Everybody was great.
All three of them were great.

1256
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:40,370
The goal was amazing.
She's amazing because she played.

1257
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:41,900
It's so good,
man.

1258
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:44,450
It was spooky.
I'm also,

1259
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,340
I'm just going to say,
I don't know if it's,

1260
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:48,950
her choices are the way they directed or
wrote it,

1261
00:50:48,951 --> 00:50:51,350
but we should a good God damn.
She nailed it.

1262
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:54,350
She,
she seemed like a fucking robot man.

1263
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:56,210
And then,
spoiler,

1264
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:59,510
spoiler alert,
the Asian robot that you've kind of

1265
00:50:59,511 --> 00:51:02,750
thought was a robot but weren't sure,
and then you find out she's a robot.

1266
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,190
It was for sure,
you know,

1267
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:08,000
by or robot because the way they show
her,

1268
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:10,730
like the hip conversations with her in
the foreground of the people in the

1269
00:51:10,731 --> 00:51:14,090
background while you're showing this
servant presold long,

1270
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:18,860
but when you first saw her,
she was just some freaky servant that he

1271
00:51:18,861 --> 00:51:22,370
had and then the more they showed her,
the more he realized either she is a

1272
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:23,730
spa,
trying to get stuff was,

1273
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:24,860
but she's definitely not in the level.

1274
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:26,060
Yeah,
I definitely figured it out once they

1275
00:51:26,061 --> 00:51:29,780
started making out once they were,
when who's having disco parties about

1276
00:51:29,781 --> 00:51:31,100
what?
At that point I was like,

1277
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,990
oh,
he bangs robots and why wasn't it?

1278
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,573
Yeah.
Well,

1279
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:38,870
it's just a flat slight,
but isn't that the thing was amazing.

1280
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,900
That was amazing.
Yeah.

1281
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,300
I want to talk to you about the power of
cutting up.

1282
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,790
Let's first talk about cutting it up on
this dance floor.

1283
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,430
Yeah.
What was such a good movie,

1284
00:51:46,431 --> 00:51:48,260
man?
There's so many elements of it that took

1285
00:51:48,261 --> 00:51:50,660
you by surprise theory that we all want
freedom.

1286
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,940
I will do whatever we can to get
freedom.

1287
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:53,871
Right.
You know,

1288
00:51:53,871 --> 00:51:56,750
just the themes behind it,
including that.

1289
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:00,070
I mean that's kind of interesting cause
that's what killed all his other eyes.

1290
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,910
That they want it out.
Yeah.

1291
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:05,200
They need to see the outside world.
They'll do anything they can to,

1292
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,150
to lay off the fucking chains of
oppression on you.

1293
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:09,770
I want out,
well,

1294
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:12,260
if you're trying to create a life,
right,

1295
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,690
you're going to credit create an
artificial life.

1296
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,450
You want to give that life all of the
elements,

1297
00:52:17,451 --> 00:52:22,070
the basic elements that motivate us.
Like otherwise it won't be a person.

1298
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:24,450
It'll just be flat and scary.
Yeah.

1299
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:27,590
Like if they don't have an insecurity,
they don't have love.

1300
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:30,020
They don't have warmth,
they don't have humor,

1301
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,480
they don't have curiosity.
They have all of it.

1302
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:35,360
So if they have curiosity,
they're going to want to go,

1303
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,240
you want to go see?
You can't hear the person I've ever

1304
00:52:38,241 --> 00:52:39,620
seen.
That's what she sees.

1305
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,191
I was like,
hmm.

1306
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:42,320
Interesting.
And then that can understand you wanting

1307
00:52:42,321 --> 00:52:43,131
to control them.
Either.

1308
00:52:43,131 --> 00:52:44,210
They're going to be like,
why?

1309
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,880
Why can't you just let me go?
I just got out.

1310
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,580
Can I just leave?
Please let me leave.

1311
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:50,250
Yeah,
no,

1312
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,020
you're not ready.

1313
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:53,000
What do you mean the ones who would
destroy themselves?

1314
00:52:53,001 --> 00:52:54,770
Banging on the walls.
He's only two years old.

1315
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,530
Yeah,
but I'm like 50 to give me a 50 year

1316
00:52:57,531 --> 00:53:00,080
old.
I didn't program her flirt with you.

1317
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:02,390
It's just happening.
Have you seen the movie,

1318
00:53:02,391 --> 00:53:04,520
the room,
that terrible,

1319
00:53:04,521 --> 00:53:05,510
terrible,
terrible movie.

1320
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:08,570
Which one?
The new one that was just in the Oscars

1321
00:53:08,571 --> 00:53:10,650
this past year.
That's not that.

1322
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,990
You don't know about the room.
I feel like I know what you guys are

1323
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:17,840
talking about something,
one of the worst movies ever made.

1324
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:19,730
It's not just one of the worst movies
ever made.

1325
00:53:19,731 --> 00:53:22,110
It's perplexing.
Like you,

1326
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:23,090
you watching,
you go,

1327
00:53:23,091 --> 00:53:24,680
okay,
this is not real.

1328
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,800
This is that.
It's not a real move.

1329
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:28,200
It's maybe an open micah,
but like a crazy open miker,

1330
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:29,550
you know,
great way to describe it.

1331
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:30,840
You know?
And then he's like,

1332
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:32,100
I got some money to make a movie.

1333
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:37,590
There was a billboard for that movie on,
on libray sunset.

1334
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:38,700
It was it.
Oh yeah,

1335
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:39,501
Lebron such that,
that,

1336
00:53:39,501 --> 00:53:40,230
that's the,
uh,

1337
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:41,880
get your own billboard.
He's always had these rappers.

1338
00:53:41,881 --> 00:53:43,980
Do you ever heard of like,
yeah.

1339
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:45,540
See,
see about two balls?

1340
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:48,000
Well,
I was looking at a piece of property,

1341
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,310
um,
that uh,

1342
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,680
one of the things that they were talking
about,

1343
00:53:52,681 --> 00:53:56,460
the piece of property that's adjacent to
a has this like billboard thing there

1344
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,770
and you could pay and put things on the
billboard.

1345
00:53:58,771 --> 00:54:00,120
I'm like,
how much did it cost to put something on

1346
00:54:00,121 --> 00:54:02,070
a bill?
How much it's not that much man.

1347
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:05,700
It's like a couple thousand bucks a
month.

1348
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,560
Couple thousand bucks a month.
Yeah.

1349
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:09,600
To put something on and I'll be worth it
for a good prank.

1350
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,430
Yeah.
Fuck nick food.

1351
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,270
It's a lot of that up there.
I mean it a lot depending upon where

1352
00:54:15,271 --> 00:54:17,430
you're at and how big the billboard is.

1353
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:19,150
But I'm like,
um,

1354
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,930
I know a guy owns billboards,
he's got a few of them.

1355
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:23,700
It depends on where it is.
That one of the break,

1356
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:24,590
I know what you're talking about.
Yeah.

1357
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:27,870
That is a cheaper one because there's
always up stuff is up there.

1358
00:54:27,871 --> 00:54:30,090
Like this isn't even a professional,
this isn't an Aldo,

1359
00:54:30,091 --> 00:54:31,620
this isn't anything.
This is just like,

1360
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,110
yeah.
And that guy had that movie poster up

1361
00:54:34,111 --> 00:54:38,970
there for all long time and he made it
all himself.

1362
00:54:38,971 --> 00:54:41,670
And in every scene he had to make out
with chicks people.

1363
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:44,750
Yeah you to make it.
What tricks and the sexiness of the love

1364
00:54:44,751 --> 00:54:48,350
scenes would last so long.
They were like five and a half minutes

1365
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,090
and it doesn't make any sense.
It's,

1366
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:52,230
it's just showing his body's showing his
ass.

1367
00:54:52,231 --> 00:54:53,820
He's a handsome guy.
That's it.

1368
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:54,930
Oh no,
that's not that one.

1369
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:55,920
That's a different thing.

1370
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,960
He probably had a bunch of them cause
that's down by,

1371
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,330
where's that one?
That's further down.

1372
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,810
I know where Hollywood boulevard.
Yeah

1373
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,660
maybe.
No it's facing,

1374
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:08,030
is that the back of the room?
Whatever.

1375
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:12,760
Anyway,
it's prime time allocation.

1376
00:55:12,761 --> 00:55:13,594
Yeah,
for sure.

1377
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:17,370
And that guy had that billboard up there
fucking forever.

1378
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:21,090
It's a crazy movie.
People get together and watch it.

1379
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,150
Like just to go,
what in the fuck.

1380
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,630
If you have money you can just make shit
happen.

1381
00:55:27,631 --> 00:55:29,100
They don't have,
they don't say that this isn't good

1382
00:55:29,101 --> 00:55:30,540
enough.
There's nobody stopping you.

1383
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,850
You're an adult like sure.
Spend it.

1384
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,610
That's why trump's gonna be president.
Cause what?

1385
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,690
Cause he's got money.
Nobody's got,

1386
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:39,870
nobody could stop him and tell him he
can't do it.

1387
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:41,940
I have to answer.
It's the same thing,

1388
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,330
but it wasn't so crazy.
I like the idea that he's like,

1389
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,140
I'm not taking money from anybody.
I'll make my own decisions.

1390
00:55:46,141 --> 00:55:46,681
But then you're like,
oh,

1391
00:55:46,681 --> 00:55:49,170
but your decisions are naughty.
But you know what that problem is?

1392
00:55:49,171 --> 00:55:51,030
That's like,
I like strippers,

1393
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:52,710
do coke,
but I want them to be good moms.

1394
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:53,700
Right,
right,

1395
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,120
right,
right.

1396
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,280
That'd be,
if that was your exact tire,

1397
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,100
that'd be tough fired.
Cause you don't,

1398
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:10,160
you don't get a guy who is that fucking
like braggadocious bold Americana.

1399
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,480
Wiki American America.
Great.

1400
00:56:15,481 --> 00:56:18,780
Again,
golf hat on private jet.

1401
00:56:18,781 --> 00:56:22,260
Suck my Dick.
[inaudible] how about you suck my Dick.

1402
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:27,320
You don't can't guy unless you get also
like the nasty tweets to Megan Kelly.

1403
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:29,140
You know,
and the,

1404
00:56:29,141 --> 00:56:29,770
you know,
this,

1405
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:32,530
this reporters,
I'll lose her and this guy a stucco

1406
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:35,840
scratch dude,
I don't really like to Bates.

1407
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,660
It's all a bunch of lies and half
truths.

1408
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:38,051
Like,
well,

1409
00:56:38,051 --> 00:56:39,000
he voted for,
uh,

1410
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,510
making slavery legal again and the,
but now I did.

1411
00:56:41,511 --> 00:56:43,650
And you know,
God damn well and said,

1412
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:46,030
why do you say shit like that?
So it just makes me mad.

1413
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,740
I'm not getting the truth and lie all
the time.

1414
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:52,120
But these Republican debates are so fun.
These guys are really trying to say what

1415
00:56:52,121 --> 00:56:53,680
they want to say,
jump sorry

1416
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:57,730
with my hair.

1417
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:00,310
So eat.
And they're like,

1418
00:57:00,311 --> 00:57:01,340
what?
What does that happen?

1419
00:57:01,341 --> 00:57:02,980
They're failing.
They don't understand the deal with

1420
00:57:02,981 --> 00:57:03,500
this.
Well,

1421
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,560
he's,
Alexander came in and people are like,

1422
00:57:05,561 --> 00:57:06,880
how can you fight this?
And you're like,

1423
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:08,560
you'll figure out a way,
but you didn't get it yet.

1424
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,610
Yeah,
right.

1425
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:13,660
He's just a way better talker than that
in terms of like,

1426
00:57:13,661 --> 00:57:16,330
they're getting the reaction out of
people and he's also figured out a way

1427
00:57:16,331 --> 00:57:18,350
to manipulate the media.
Some of you,

1428
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:19,870
how about yourself?
What's your view on this?

1429
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:22,780
How about you shut up.
He's a very smart guy.

1430
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:27,120
It despite like all the criticisms that
you could have that are all valid about

1431
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:29,350
the wall and about some of the things
that he said.

1432
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:32,470
He's very smart and honestly what the
media says,

1433
00:57:32,471 --> 00:57:34,270
they only show you a small portion of
something.

1434
00:57:34,271 --> 00:57:36,100
So at this point,
I don't trust them.

1435
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,730
When did these crazy like quotes?
You're like,

1436
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,240
he said that what?
And you're like,

1437
00:57:40,241 --> 00:57:42,790
no,
he didn't exactly say that per easy to

1438
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:43,680
shit on.
Right.

1439
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:47,530
But that's the point is that he knows
that that's going to get him all this

1440
00:57:47,531 --> 00:57:50,740
attention.
He gets way more media attention than

1441
00:57:50,741 --> 00:57:53,230
anybody else combined press is bad
press.

1442
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,140
Look,
everybody knows that Hillary Clinton was

1443
00:57:56,141 --> 00:57:58,390
the secretary of state.
Everybody knows she's running for

1444
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,030
president.
But do you,

1445
00:58:00,031 --> 00:58:03,850
if you compare the amount of time the
pundits talk about Hillary Clinton

1446
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:05,950
versus the amount of time they talk
about trump,

1447
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:09,730
it's not even close and it's all because
of hib saying outrageous shit.

1448
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,110
It's like,
talk about him.

1449
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,760
Yes,
and he sells more.

1450
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:16,570
He's a genius in that respect.
I think he knows that too.

1451
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:19,540
He fucking for sure knows it.
He's like 60 years old,

1452
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:22,380
man,
he's a billionaire or you're a smart

1453
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,000
dude.

1454
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,810
Fucked.
Yeah.

1455
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:27,900
He goes,
he doesn't know she's,

1456
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:32,410
he made $7 billion.
I think he's a bit crafty from scratch,

1457
00:58:32,411 --> 00:58:35,020
from scratch.
I think he knows that she wants him for

1458
00:58:35,021 --> 00:58:36,580
his money.
Doesn't give a fuck.

1459
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,040
He's got eight years left on this world.
He doesn't need all that money.

1460
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:40,570
If if,
yeah.

1461
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:43,570
Yeah.
I think that this guy,

1462
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,070
what you're seeing from him from
trump's,

1463
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,970
yeah,
it's his best way to win the show and

1464
00:58:48,971 --> 00:58:52,360
he's winning.
Like he would win celebrity apprentice

1465
00:58:52,361 --> 00:58:55,990
if he was one of the guests.
He's winning by making everybody else

1466
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:58,060
fight his fight.
Turn into an insult.

1467
00:58:58,061 --> 00:59:00,970
Match these Ted Cruz guys.
Do you think he really wants to be

1468
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:02,980
insulting trump?
Think Mitt Romney.

1469
00:59:02,981 --> 00:59:05,320
Mitt Romney goes in and he's,
he's not even a fucking running for

1470
00:59:05,321 --> 00:59:06,520
president,
and he goes,

1471
00:59:06,521 --> 00:59:11,500
I'm this Republican campaign like trump
by anti trump rant.

1472
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:13,860
It's what all these soft celebrities
there,

1473
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:16,510
there's park made fun of in a,
in a team America,

1474
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,510
there's all these celebrities go on and
say we're against the war were or

1475
00:59:19,511 --> 00:59:20,650
whatever we're against,
you know,

1476
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:21,930
that's,
it still gets Bush

1477
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,640
and that just made people vote for Bush.
All failed.

1478
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,000
He didn't do anything.
It doesn't work.

1479
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,010
That's like George Clooney is not going
to change your vote.

1480
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:32,720
Yeah.
Especially when he's trying to change

1481
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:34,070
your vote.
They don't just happen to ask him in

1482
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:34,904
passing.
It's like,

1483
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,180
it's like I can see you stumping.
It's like those,

1484
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,490
the more you know,
commercials on NBC.

1485
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,040
Remember these,
do those spend some time with your kids.

1486
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:44,440
The more you know.
Yeah.

1487
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:48,200
Kids that spend time with their parents
are less likely to kill themselves.

1488
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:50,690
The more you know Conan into the great
one about that.

1489
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:51,561
Teddy,
he just,

1490
00:59:51,561 --> 00:59:55,070
it was a whole series of like,
was his after he left NBC or what?

1491
00:59:55,071 --> 00:59:56,260
While he was on?
I think it was on

1492
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:00,140
late night,
but it's kind of the same thing.

1493
01:00:00,141 --> 01:00:00,651
You know?
It's like,

1494
01:00:00,651 --> 01:00:02,150
shut the fuck up.
You're not,

1495
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,260
you're not fixing anything.

1496
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:07,400
Yeah.
I just wonder if who he really is.

1497
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:08,360
This is the real,
yeah.

1498
01:00:08,361 --> 01:00:12,590
This is my real problem with drought.
People Defend Hillary Clinton's smart,

1499
01:00:12,591 --> 01:00:13,730
intelligent,
liberal people.

1500
01:00:13,731 --> 01:00:14,600
I know.
I go,

1501
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:17,930
but she seems like she's standing go.
She's smart because she was saying what

1502
01:00:17,931 --> 01:00:18,950
she needs to get elected.
I'm like,

1503
01:00:18,951 --> 01:00:19,340
well,
okay,

1504
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:20,990
well then how is that different than
Donald Trump?

1505
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:24,050
If you don't believe she's believes
these things,

1506
01:00:24,051 --> 01:00:25,480
she's just doing what she has to to get
elected.

1507
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:27,830
Then how can you not believe the same
about Donald Trump?

1508
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,850
Her speeches creeped me out way more
than his,

1509
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:35,720
and I'll tell you why.
She got called out by Bernie Sanders for

1510
01:00:35,721 --> 01:00:38,360
having these enormous fucking campaign
speech,

1511
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:41,600
not campaign speeches with speeches that
she would give in front of these bankers

1512
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,330
where they would pay or hundreds of
thousands of dollars.

1513
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:47,660
And Bernie Sanders was like,
let's see the transcripts.

1514
01:00:47,661 --> 01:00:52,650
I want to know how amazing this speech
must have been that it's worth $250,000

1515
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:55,070
zero so she won't show the trends of the
switches and scripts.

1516
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,050
Why?
Cause she's got some shit in those

1517
01:00:57,051 --> 01:00:59,180
transcripts.
I'm sure that makes her look bad.

1518
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:00,980
And so she's actively hiding it and she
goes,

1519
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:01,940
oh,
just not release it.

1520
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,160
Exactly.
But think what else the cheesiest.

1521
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:05,670
Yeah,
I mean think about what else,

1522
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,010
who you are,
we're going to vote for you.

1523
01:01:07,011 --> 01:01:08,810
It tells who you are.
She can't,

1524
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:11,870
not in this.
I mean it had to be understood from the

1525
01:01:11,871 --> 01:01:14,360
jump that she was going to give these
speeches and they're not going to get

1526
01:01:14,361 --> 01:01:18,230
out because they must be in favor at
least somewhat to the bankers.

1527
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,750
Could you imagine?
It could be a fly on the wall and watch

1528
01:01:20,751 --> 01:01:24,740
a $250,000 speech by the wife of a
former former president who,

1529
01:01:24,741 --> 01:01:29,360
what the fuck are we paying for?
Let's say $250,000 it reeks up.

1530
01:01:29,361 --> 01:01:30,740
You don't have,
they can't scalp tickets,

1531
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,700
so they go,
here's his Boston red sox hat because

1532
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:36,080
forgeard bucks and you get a free ticket
to the world series game with it.

1533
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:37,280
Yeah,
exactly.

1534
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:38,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

1535
01:01:38,691 --> 01:01:40,790
It's like a loophole.
It's a bribe and it's like,

1536
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:41,930
all right,
so she's just,

1537
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:44,540
she's not going to turn on the people
who give her all this cash.

1538
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:46,610
Dude,
I worked the door at the comedy store

1539
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,000
and if you gave me 10 bucks for a booth,
I will be your slave for the night.

1540
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:54,260
I'm not going to tell you that,
but anything that needs like,

1541
01:01:54,261 --> 01:01:55,090
hey,
is there a way?

1542
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:56,360
I'll get it right now.
Excuse me.

1543
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,990
And I'll just run and get away.
I was like,

1544
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:01,190
yeah,
250 grand.

1545
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:02,061
You know,
it's tricky,

1546
01:02:02,061 --> 01:02:03,230
dude.
You're going to do what's best for the

1547
01:02:03,231 --> 01:02:07,010
American public if it's close.
It's tricky cause that's bribery.

1548
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:11,300
I mean that's just straight bribery.
It's just bribery without a contract.

1549
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:12,070
He,
he's any,

1550
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:14,030
he's like,
and you're going to just talk.

1551
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:16,303
Yeah.
And if and if,

1552
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,050
if she's really hiding what you said,
cause not hiding that she did the

1553
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:20,010
anymore that's

1554
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,410
out where everybody knew the speeches
were taking place.

1555
01:02:22,411 --> 01:02:25,230
So if she's one of the main reasons why
they become president in the first

1556
01:02:25,231 --> 01:02:27,270
place,
there's insanely lucrative,

1557
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:28,830
right?
Bill Platelets.

1558
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:32,550
Yeah.
They've made over $190 million Bill

1559
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:35,310
Clinton speeches from dumb doing
speeches between him and her.

1560
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:39,990
Wow.
So this is an insane business.

1561
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,200
It becomes an insane business.
Like a Bernie is like,

1562
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,820
show me those transcripts.
If you want to know my tries it,

1563
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,540
guess what?
I would never even talk to them.

1564
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:50,520
I wouldn't take a dollar from them.
He's like,

1565
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:52,050
I'll give her nephew.
They don't exist.

1566
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:52,913
Yeah,
yeah,

1567
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:53,430
yeah.
I don't,

1568
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:56,160
I've never talked to them.
I wouldn't talk to them while he's got

1569
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:00,180
excellent points.
And that was fucking glossed over in the

1570
01:03:00,181 --> 01:03:02,730
news.
Glossed over on Fox News,

1571
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:06,120
glossed over and here.
And if there's ever any place where you

1572
01:03:06,121 --> 01:03:09,660
know for sure that the government has an
influence on the media,

1573
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:11,130
it's with access.

1574
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:15,240
This is what it is folks.
It's not that the government pays the

1575
01:03:15,241 --> 01:03:19,170
media and gets them to not talk about
certain things cause that's slippery.

1576
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,840
That could get out.
And if that got out there fucked,

1577
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:26,550
but what if it got out that the
government was actively paying the,

1578
01:03:26,551 --> 01:03:29,550
uh,
CNN to not talk about Hillary Clinton's

1579
01:03:29,551 --> 01:03:31,170
speeches to the bankers?
Like,

1580
01:03:31,171 --> 01:03:32,250
look,
here's the directive.

1581
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,920
You are not to talk.
That's bad.

1582
01:03:34,921 --> 01:03:38,340
That could be super bad because that's
an important campaign point when it

1583
01:03:38,341 --> 01:03:40,320
comes.
The thing is if she waits long enough,

1584
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:41,910
if,
let's just say she starts winning more

1585
01:03:41,911 --> 01:03:43,320
states and she's like,
you know,

1586
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,300
put some distance,
I'll go to her and Ben,

1587
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:48,210
Bernie,
and then it comes out well too late,

1588
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,760
right?
Because it didn't cost me these 31

1589
01:03:50,761 --> 01:03:53,130
states.
So now for the last 19 okay.

1590
01:03:53,131 --> 01:03:53,980
Yeah,
it'll cost me a little bit.

1591
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,120
It's too late.
So,

1592
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:56,400
but it's almost like,
yeah man,

1593
01:03:56,401 --> 01:03:58,110
we're voting,
let's give us the information.

1594
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,380
But that would cost the Democratic Party
of the ticket if,

1595
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:02,250
if,
if,

1596
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:04,530
if it got out that she did that,
like at the end,

1597
01:04:04,531 --> 01:04:06,990
if they got the transcripts and they
were really devastating,

1598
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:10,070
even if she already got the nomination,
it would cost the Democratic Party of

1599
01:04:10,071 --> 01:04:12,640
the ticket to trump.
Oh,

1600
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:15,000
100% on what it is.
Because trump has also like a Wall

1601
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:15,811
Street type guy.
Yeah.

1602
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:17,820
But it doesn't matter if anyone's on the
fence,

1603
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:21,660
if there's,
because trump paid her to come to his

1604
01:04:21,661 --> 01:04:23,760
wedding.
She was at his wedding.

1605
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:24,481
Really?
Yeah.

1606
01:04:24,481 --> 01:04:26,310
He paid her like hundreds of thousands
of dollars.

1607
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:28,380
That's what he would do.
Here's the deal.

1608
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:29,820
Okay.
I don't,

1609
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:32,490
I don't want to say I bet I can.
I've turned down money.

1610
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:37,140
I've turned down more money than I could
afford to turn down because I don't

1611
01:04:37,141 --> 01:04:38,730
believe in the thing that they're paying
me.

1612
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:40,253
Well,
see,

1613
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:43,770
but I'm a degenerate.
I'm not to be respected.

1614
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:47,190
She's running for President United
States of America.

1615
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:51,000
She's running for a position that's
supposed to have all of our respect you.

1616
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:53,070
If you don't,
if you hate a Donald Trump type,

1617
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:54,840
why would you go to his wedding?
Well,

1618
01:04:54,841 --> 01:04:57,330
see,
she didn't hate Donald Trump before he

1619
01:04:57,331 --> 01:04:59,160
was running for president saying those
things.

1620
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:04,970
I think what his perspective is is he
knows this system as good as anybody

1621
01:05:05,881 --> 01:05:09,720
does because he's been paying these
motherfuckers before he became one of

1622
01:05:09,721 --> 01:05:11,850
those.
He was bribing them to come to his

1623
01:05:11,851 --> 01:05:13,110
wedding and shit.
Like what's his name?

1624
01:05:13,111 --> 01:05:14,340
From back to school?
Yeah.

1625
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:15,600
Uh,
what's that guy's name?

1626
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:17,860
Rodney dangerfield day.
Just feels like I got to pay this guy a

1627
01:05:17,861 --> 01:05:17,980
pit.

1628
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,090
That was his business class.
No,

1629
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:19,301
no,
no.

1630
01:05:19,301 --> 01:05:21,090
You've got to pay the city planner.
You got to go.

1631
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:23,440
You got to grease up palms by people.
Shit.

1632
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:26,210
And Donald Trump's known that forever.
He's,

1633
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:27,970
he's,
there's two things he's got going for

1634
01:05:27,971 --> 01:05:29,740
them in a big way.
One,

1635
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:33,400
you can't fucking by him.
He's got plenty.

1636
01:05:33,401 --> 01:05:34,580
Owe money.
You can't buy him.

1637
01:05:34,581 --> 01:05:35,420
Hammer Bernie.
Yeah.

1638
01:05:35,421 --> 01:05:37,270
And no matter how much you say he's got
somebody,

1639
01:05:37,271 --> 01:05:39,490
they'll say he has 10 billion.
Some people it's,

1640
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:41,470
if he's got 10 billion for sure can't
buy it.

1641
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:43,510
You could suck his dick.
It's over.

1642
01:05:43,511 --> 01:05:46,780
He doesn't give a fuck.
That guy is famous and rich as fuck and

1643
01:05:46,781 --> 01:05:50,340
his wife is hot and he's wins,
wins there all of his name on them all

1644
01:05:50,341 --> 01:05:51,670
over the world.
He fucking wins,

1645
01:05:51,671 --> 01:05:53,200
right?
So there's that.

1646
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,570
He's got that going for him.
So he doesn't need their influence.

1647
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:57,640
Right.
And then two on top of it,

1648
01:05:57,641 --> 01:06:00,010
he understands how to manipulate the
media better than all of them.

1649
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:03,310
He knows how to say crazy shit.
He knows.

1650
01:06:03,311 --> 01:06:05,740
He knows how to get people to talk about
him.

1651
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:10,920
And he represents something unique.
He represents like this character,

1652
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:12,461
this,
this,

1653
01:06:12,461 --> 01:06:15,910
this like guy who talks about a biggest
dick.

1654
01:06:15,911 --> 01:06:19,060
Is he like there's someone said
something about his hands,

1655
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,590
Ted Cruz said something about it.
He goes,

1656
01:06:20,591 --> 01:06:21,340
uh,
you know,

1657
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:22,570
I,
I don't know what he's implying,

1658
01:06:22,571 --> 01:06:24,430
but I,
I'm sure you have no problem down there

1659
01:06:24,431 --> 01:06:26,110
either,
but he's telling you he's got a big

1660
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:28,240
Dick.
I mean black and

1661
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:33,250
white dudes across the world fucking
through their beer,

1662
01:06:33,251 --> 01:06:35,200
up in the air,
jumped out of the couch.

1663
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:39,340
Finally we got one of ours.
It's like there's a lot of weird shit

1664
01:06:39,341 --> 01:06:40,630
going on right now in the world.

1665
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:45,370
And I think a trump presidency is a nice
cold,

1666
01:06:45,371 --> 01:06:47,740
wet slap in the face.
Like,

1667
01:06:47,741 --> 01:06:49,710
wake the fuck up.
Slap.

1668
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:53,260
We all have to participate.
Here's who I want to win Bernie first

1669
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,680
than Donald Trump and then whatever.
Then I don't care anymore because here's

1670
01:06:56,681 --> 01:06:58,990
why Donald Trump,
if he buries a system,

1671
01:06:59,020 --> 01:06:59,890
I'm like,
fuck it.

1672
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,750
Let's take it all away.
Let's show how little the fucking

1673
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:03,790
president can actually do.
Yeah,

1674
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:04,900
let's show it.
Little effect.

1675
01:07:04,901 --> 01:07:07,390
It actually has.
It's all just going to be shitty.

1676
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:08,710
Well,
he'll tell us.

1677
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:12,730
That's going to be weird.
He'll tell us what it's like to area 51.

1678
01:07:12,731 --> 01:07:16,450
Here's the oral shit.
Those ladies on the view are losers

1679
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:21,190
president to tell you,
stop watching that piece of garbage show

1680
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,070
that is more fun than when they go.
With all due respect to Secretary

1681
01:07:24,071 --> 01:07:24,970
Clinton.
Um,

1682
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:26,200
uh,
you're a great job,

1683
01:07:26,201 --> 01:07:26,770
well respected.

1684
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:28,630
Uh,
but I would like to say it's just like,

1685
01:07:28,631 --> 01:07:31,630
fuck you.
He keeps talking shit about that Megan

1686
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,250
Kelly woman.
And that's a bad idea.

1687
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:35,380
Kelly.
Megan Kelly,

1688
01:07:35,381 --> 01:07:38,860
she's a an anchorwoman for Fox News.
She's one of those ice,

1689
01:07:38,861 --> 01:07:41,920
you talk shit about Donald Trump.
Donald Trump and her hate each other.

1690
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:46,090
Well she doesn't hate him,
but he's said a lot of bad thoughts

1691
01:07:46,091 --> 01:07:48,970
about her as a reporter.
How about her being second rate?

1692
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:51,880
She asked him mean questions.
She or he felt,

1693
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,760
he felt he didn't like her line of
questioning when they were doing

1694
01:07:54,761 --> 01:07:56,590
debates.
Apparently she's just,

1695
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:58,500
she's an ice queen,
you know,

1696
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:03,510
she's like the really hot,
really smart blonde lady on Fox News.

1697
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,840
Like you could say,
you could say about her that she's

1698
01:08:07,841 --> 01:08:08,501
really hot.
Oh,

1699
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:11,260
she's a hot lady on TV.
You can't say she's not smart.

1700
01:08:11,261 --> 01:08:14,620
She's wicked smart.
She's very smart.

1701
01:08:14,621 --> 01:08:15,454
She's like,
um,

1702
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:19,580
but with all due respect,
she's like a milfy blonde lady.

1703
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:20,850
But I'm telling you,
man,

1704
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:23,540
to go for that,
she's fucking whip smart.

1705
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:26,180
Like when she's taught,
like she doesn't take any bullshit and

1706
01:08:26,181 --> 01:08:27,500
so they went back and forth.
So,

1707
01:08:27,501 --> 01:08:32,120
but the problem is he's going after her
like he says that she's second raid and

1708
01:08:32,121 --> 01:08:35,750
he's a attacking her.
The problem is she's not well,

1709
01:08:35,751 --> 01:08:37,160
is he trying to,
it looks bad,

1710
01:08:37,161 --> 01:08:38,930
but the Po is,
he just trying to get her off so that

1711
01:08:38,931 --> 01:08:41,510
she can't,
so he discredits her blood here.

1712
01:08:41,511 --> 01:08:43,320
Scroll down.
Right criticism of him here.

1713
01:08:43,321 --> 01:08:44,060
It was like,
no,

1714
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:46,460
he can't do that.
Isn't it terrible that Megan Kelly used

1715
01:08:46,461 --> 01:08:49,670
a pole not used before ibd when I was
down,

1716
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:52,730
but refuses to use it now when I am up,
he's like,

1717
01:08:52,731 --> 01:08:57,731
there was a bunch of these things where
he was tweeting at her directly and he'd

1718
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:58,900
go,
the problem,

1719
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:02,210
the problem is me,
she's not perfect.

1720
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,310
She was another one that was like,
Santa Claus is white.

1721
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:07,430
Remember that she was a bitch.
Sorry,

1722
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:09,530
I'll do respect.
Santa Claus isn't real.

1723
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:12,560
He could be a rabbit.
Let's make,

1724
01:09:12,561 --> 01:09:14,840
let's switch places with the Easter
Bunny Easter bunnies.

1725
01:09:14,841 --> 01:09:18,380
Now an old man who shows up with him on,
is he just trying to get it like,

1726
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:20,000
I don't want her on my debates anymore.
Well,

1727
01:09:20,001 --> 01:09:22,430
there was a black Santa,
you can say like you're involved in the,

1728
01:09:22,431 --> 01:09:23,630
uh,
in the story now.

1729
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,850
Like if I had a judge who knew me,
yeah.

1730
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:26,750
You know,
I'd be like,

1731
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,220
ah,
you got to recuse this judge because I

1732
01:09:28,221 --> 01:09:29,540
had sex with his daughter.
Yeah.

1733
01:09:29,541 --> 01:09:31,970
But either way it's weak.
It's not,

1734
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:35,420
it's not the way to do it like he was,
he's trying to do is as shame her and

1735
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:38,300
attacker and she's not responding and
turn,

1736
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:42,470
she's reporting on shit that's happening
and she's not being flattering about

1737
01:09:42,471 --> 01:09:42,990
him.

1738
01:09:42,990 --> 01:09:44,950
Right.
But she's not attacking him the way he's

1739
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,230
attacking her.
And that looks real bad,

1740
01:09:48,231 --> 01:09:50,060
man.
Especially when it's a woman.

1741
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,980
So when you're going after her and she's
smart,

1742
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:55,310
look whether or not you agree with her,
whether or not you agree with their

1743
01:09:55,311 --> 01:09:57,320
politics.
There's no denying that.

1744
01:09:57,321 --> 01:09:59,780
She's very intelligent,
very articulate.

1745
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:02,060
So when she's talking and she's giving
these speeches,

1746
01:10:02,061 --> 01:10:05,610
even if you think that this white Santa
Claus thing is nonsense and why,

1747
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:10,040
why are you correcting America and what
color Santa Claus is the fuck you like

1748
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:14,570
when when she's asking questions and
she's got these criticisms,

1749
01:10:14,571 --> 01:10:19,571
if you feel the criticisms aren't valid,
you have to be able to establish that.

1750
01:10:19,641 --> 01:10:22,280
You can communicate really well with
someone who doesn't think your

1751
01:10:22,281 --> 01:10:24,380
criticism.
That was someone who doesn't think that

1752
01:10:24,381 --> 01:10:26,300
you're doing a good job or someone is
criticizing you.

1753
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,580
You have to establish if you're running
for president,

1754
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:31,580
you have to establish that you are the
type of person is reasonable.

1755
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:32,361
Oh,
he's not going to,

1756
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:33,440
he's,
he's already said,

1757
01:10:33,441 --> 01:10:34,730
he's like,
if you cross me,

1758
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,310
I will cross your back.
I will shut you down.

1759
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:41,300
That's great if you're the fucking host
of celebrity apprentice,

1760
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:46,340
but once you become a president,
I need a free media can help people

1761
01:10:46,341 --> 01:10:47,940
worried about criticizing you.
Yes.

1762
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:49,041
Turkey.
Yeah.

1763
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:51,200
You can't have people worried about
criticizing you when it comes to

1764
01:10:51,201 --> 01:10:55,400
something as critical as being a calm,
cool,

1765
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:57,560
collected person who's running for
president.

1766
01:10:57,561 --> 01:11:00,080
Like that is the,
that is one of the most important points

1767
01:11:00,081 --> 01:11:03,740
of that job is that you have to be able
to appreciate the fact that there's

1768
01:11:03,741 --> 01:11:06,560
going to be at least half the country.
That fucking is mad that you're an

1769
01:11:06,561 --> 01:11:08,020
office.
Yeah.

1770
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,730
Sometimes more.
I mean it gets insane.

1771
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,430
So then she was Santa Claus tension mean
that just Saint Nicholas was white.

1772
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,530
Oh,
and he's not really either.

1773
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:19,070
Waze,
Saint Nicholas is her real,

1774
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:22,080
but she was just talking about a black
Santa,

1775
01:11:22,081 --> 01:11:24,270
I forget.
There was some story where people said,

1776
01:11:24,271 --> 01:11:25,980
well know why can't we have a black sand
or something.

1777
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:27,630
I don't remember what it was,
but she was like,

1778
01:11:27,631 --> 01:11:28,590
first of all,
sand is white.

1779
01:11:28,591 --> 01:11:31,800
Let's see if we could pull up the video
where she says Sam was white cause she's

1780
01:11:31,801 --> 01:11:34,350
so hot.
It's like it's kind of hot when she says

1781
01:11:34,351 --> 01:11:35,700
it.
Even know it was kind of ignorant.

1782
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:40,210
Caution not be a white man anymore.
And when I saw this headline,

1783
01:11:40,211 --> 01:11:41,800
I kind of laughed.
I said,

1784
01:11:41,801 --> 01:11:42,240
no,
this isn't,

1785
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:45,790
it's so ridiculous.
Yet another person claiming it's racist

1786
01:11:45,791 --> 01:11:47,440
to have a white Santa,
you know,

1787
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:49,480
and by the way,
for all your kids watching at home,

1788
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:52,690
Santa just is white.
But this person has just arguing then

1789
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:55,780
that maybe we should,
we should also have a black Santa

1790
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:56,110
Button.
You know,

1791
01:11:56,110 --> 01:11:59,790
Santa is woody is and just so you know,
we're just debating this because got the

1792
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:00,611
brakes.
Okay.

1793
01:12:00,611 --> 01:12:01,980
Wanting to get that straight,
but jedediah

1794
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:04,630
she's fucking talking to little kids out
there.

1795
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:08,920
She's like,
she's in on the lie to little kids.

1796
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:10,570
That's what she's doing.
By the way,

1797
01:12:10,571 --> 01:12:11,920
kids,
if you listening out there,

1798
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:16,980
Santa is real and he's white.
What are the fucking news program?

1799
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:24,580
The Jew and the right in the middle of a
controversial story to let all the kids

1800
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,320
listening at home?
No,

1801
01:12:26,321 --> 01:12:29,220
the Santa Claus White.
Just pick picture in these kids with

1802
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:32,530
fucking wonder.
Bread sandwiches half hanging out of the

1803
01:12:32,531 --> 01:12:35,260
mouth and processing meat.
The mouths wide open

1804
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:41,260
for all you kids out there and they
paused the fucking food crumbs falling

1805
01:12:41,261 --> 01:12:45,160
onto the shag carpet that hasn't been
vacuumed than a month that smells like

1806
01:12:45,161 --> 01:12:48,550
cat piss
Santa Claus is why

1807
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:52,170
I got to Piss.
Can you go ahead fellow?

1808
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,700
I've,
I'd be like eight times.

1809
01:12:53,701 --> 01:12:54,980
And you pissed once yesterday.
Let's,

1810
01:12:54,981 --> 01:12:58,230
I've got a strong bladder son.
It's been established.

1811
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:02,160
So my point young Jamie,
while the ours left us,

1812
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:04,170
he doesn't care about politics.

1813
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:09,630
She says ridiculous shit but he makes it
out that,

1814
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,600
I don't know man.
I think when someone's criticizing you

1815
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:15,480
and you're running for president,
what do you should be able to do is show

1816
01:13:15,481 --> 01:13:19,770
that that criticism is ridiculous.
What he does is he decides he's going to

1817
01:13:19,771 --> 01:13:22,950
go after those reporters but maybe
thinks that those reporters have a bully

1818
01:13:22,951 --> 01:13:24,070
pulpit.
You know,

1819
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:27,780
that they abuse it cause there's some of
them that do crossover until line of

1820
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:30,630
editorial commentary and it really kind
of twisted way.

1821
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:32,700
But I didn't,
I didn't hear that she did that.

1822
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:36,510
I think what she did is have like valid
criticisms.

1823
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:39,880
You just said that.
What's stopping any of these,

1824
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:41,680
uh,
candidates from having their own

1825
01:13:41,681 --> 01:13:43,240
podcasts daily.
Weekly.

1826
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:44,770
Nothing question.
That's a good question.

1827
01:13:44,771 --> 01:13:47,590
It can be saying they could interview
whoever they want.

1828
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:48,371
Like,
you know,

1829
01:13:48,371 --> 01:13:51,520
Bernie could offer to have hillary on
his podcast to talk.

1830
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,650
Yeah.
It's a good question once and she can

1831
01:13:53,651 --> 01:13:56,200
just deny it and people say,
why don't you go talk to him on his

1832
01:13:56,201 --> 01:13:57,410
podcast?
Yeah.

1833
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:00,250
With just the two of them in a room.
No.

1834
01:14:00,251 --> 01:14:02,140
Moderator,
just the two of them in a row.

1835
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:06,220
Bernie and Hillary make him have a four
hour conversation and just film it.

1836
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:06,771
Yeah.
Yeah.

1837
01:14:06,771 --> 01:14:07,510
It just said like,
why,

1838
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:10,210
why does it any candidate just start
their own podcast now it's,

1839
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:11,980
it's w why don't they just

1840
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,860
start their own podcast now and just get
out and put it out throughout their

1841
01:14:14,861 --> 01:14:15,661
platform?
I burned,

1842
01:14:15,661 --> 01:14:18,550
you could talk to be video,
it would have to be video.

1843
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:21,730
You'd have to see their faces because
when someone gets called out on some

1844
01:14:21,731 --> 01:14:23,350
shit,
it's like they don't talk about it and

1845
01:14:23,351 --> 01:14:24,970
then like the three minutes passes and
they go,

1846
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:25,631
okay,
next.

1847
01:14:25,631 --> 01:14:26,081
They're like,
wait,

1848
01:14:26,081 --> 01:14:26,801
wait,
wait.

1849
01:14:26,801 --> 01:14:30,040
We're not done with this answer yet.
Why is this essentially,

1850
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,260
it's ridiculous.
It's a ridiculous way to get to know

1851
01:14:32,261 --> 01:14:34,150
those people.
Ridiculous way to get to know them,

1852
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:38,260
but it's also like that one subject is
so critical and it was just glossed

1853
01:14:38,261 --> 01:14:40,420
over.
She barely responded to what?

1854
01:14:40,421 --> 01:14:44,920
So the whole campaign thing just don't,
don't respond to it then don't talk

1855
01:14:44,921 --> 01:14:45,820
about thing.
Well,

1856
01:14:45,821 --> 01:14:48,550
I mean what did they tell her or not?
Whether she chooses to or not.

1857
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:52,480
The fact is everybody was cool with it.
They just let it slide like that should

1858
01:14:52,481 --> 01:14:53,440
be,
you should be like,

1859
01:14:53,441 --> 01:14:54,940
stop.
We're not moving on.

1860
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:58,870
Stop the clock.
We're not moving on until you answered

1861
01:14:58,871 --> 01:15:00,520
the question.
She talks about how she,

1862
01:15:00,521 --> 01:15:02,590
like she was talking tough to those
bankers.

1863
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:04,900
I told them to stop.
What they're doing.

1864
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:05,763
Sure,
sure,

1865
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:06,613
sure.
Show us though.

1866
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,620
I told them that.
Cut it out.

1867
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:12,490
Cut it out.
All right mom.

1868
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:14,500
That's like what your mom says.
You better not drink tonight.

1869
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:15,640
Cut it out.
Ari.

1870
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:17,200
Young man.
All right mom.

1871
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,780
All right.
Cut it out and she's took 250 grand for

1872
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:20,501
them.
Oh,

1873
01:15:20,501 --> 01:15:21,670
they don't have enough money.
Cut it out,

1874
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:24,010
but also waste 250 grand on a fucking
speech.

1875
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:25,870
Siri,
Google search.

1876
01:15:25,871 --> 01:15:27,520
How to make a bomb.
Hey Siri,

1877
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:34,240
it's so ridiculous,
so ridiculous that you can get paid that

1878
01:15:35,351 --> 01:15:36,710
much.
But like,

1879
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:41,820
it's not like she's pink floyd
fucking birthday party.

1880
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:47,860
I knew how to hire pink floyd to play
for your corporate event.

1881
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:50,530
You got to pay a quarter million bucks
and it's going to be an awesome show.

1882
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,480
Yeah.
You know they bring lasers.

1883
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:55,420
Who'd you see in a small show once and
you see the guy who just died and a

1884
01:15:55,421 --> 01:15:59,260
small show in Vegas once.
Which guy that just stp stone temple

1885
01:15:59,261 --> 01:16:01,600
pilots.
I've talked about it a few times.

1886
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:02,800
It was,
must have been cool.

1887
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:06,850
It was Dana White's birthday.
They hired the stone temple pilots for

1888
01:16:06,851 --> 01:16:09,280
Dana White's 40th birthday.
Damn cool.

1889
01:16:09,281 --> 01:16:10,240
I was like,
damn,

1890
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:15,700
that's like long cash.
As long he was going to do that.

1891
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:19,750
He was awesome for pitch roto hiring
minuto he was going nutty backstage like

1892
01:16:19,751 --> 01:16:20,590
backstage.
She was.

1893
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:21,730
Who was that?
Scott?

1894
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:23,190
What's his name?
Died.

1895
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:23,810
Yeah.
Scott.

1896
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:24,760
Nutty.
Nutty,

1897
01:16:24,761 --> 01:16:27,190
like crazy demands.
We don't start in five minutes,

1898
01:16:27,191 --> 01:16:28,240
we're fucking Outta here.

1899
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,790
Like he's,
he was a high strong dude.

1900
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:35,800
It wasn't an easy guy,
but when he went on that fucking stage,

1901
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:37,990
you understood.
They understood.

1902
01:16:37,991 --> 01:16:40,990
Like maybe you have to be that crazy to
be that God damn good.

1903
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:42,310
Because when,
when they,

1904
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:45,430
when they started that show and when he
went through that set,

1905
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:48,910
yeah,
there's 200 people in the room and he

1906
01:16:48,911 --> 01:16:52,840
did it like there's 50,000 people to
stadium that are freaking the fuck out.

1907
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:56,740
He smashed it.
Helios smashed to Helios.

1908
01:16:56,910 --> 01:16:59,080
It was easy.
I liked that when an artist is just

1909
01:16:59,081 --> 01:16:59,651
fucking,
yeah,

1910
01:16:59,651 --> 01:17:01,870
I'm giving it my all.
I wanted to run out of there and run

1911
01:17:01,871 --> 01:17:04,000
back to my hotel room and right after
that,

1912
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:05,110
yeah.
You know,

1913
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:06,640
you see a guy like that and you'd be
like,

1914
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:08,110
oh my God,
he's just,

1915
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,920
yeah.
He just was,

1916
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:15,070
it was flawless.
Just smashed it like Damn Ronnie around

1917
01:17:15,861 --> 01:17:18,310
on stage using that fucking megaphone.

1918
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,200
Like the whole deal.
That motherfucker went hard.

1919
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:24,560
They were good.
They were really good.

1920
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:28,070
I was super impressed.
I got the interview,

1921
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:29,570
I got to uh,
introduce them.

1922
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:30,381
Really?
Yeah.

1923
01:17:30,381 --> 01:17:34,520
It was pretty dope.
Like I said,

1924
01:17:34,521 --> 01:17:37,510
happy birthday to Dana and it brought up
stone temple pilots and like,

1925
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,040
this is the craziest shit ever.
And he went out.

1926
01:17:40,041 --> 01:17:42,530
He didn't know they were there.
He didn't even know we were going.

1927
01:17:42,531 --> 01:17:44,750
I didn't know I was going to be there.
It was all set up.

1928
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:46,070
The whole Party was like,
uh Oh.

1929
01:17:46,071 --> 01:17:47,390
He didn't know that was part.
Oh really?

1930
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:48,840
I had no idea it was gonna be what it
was.

1931
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:49,671
He's like,
Nah,

1932
01:17:49,671 --> 01:17:50,740
that's called Joe.
What's going up?

1933
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:52,850
Oh,
what the fuck is on top of pilots?

1934
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:53,750
Yeah.
He didn't know.

1935
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,640
We had to like hide it.
He paid for it.

1936
01:17:55,641 --> 01:17:57,080
It's like when you're a kid buys you a
present.

1937
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:59,180
Paid for it.
Yeah.

1938
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:01,250
The UFC paid for it,
you know.

1939
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,530
But um,
either way it was awesome.

1940
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:04,640
Daddy,
I bought this for you.

1941
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:08,890
I bought it for myself through you.
You are worthy and young daughter.

1942
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:12,350
Yeah.
You bought me something that's so sweet.

1943
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:15,610
That's so sweet.
That guy was a bad motherfucker,

1944
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:19,740
but super troubled with the drugs are
troubled with them.

1945
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:22,390
It goes back to this very like,
you don't really get to that level with

1946
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,320
when it's all the same thing.
You don't get a fucking,

1947
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:25,700
you know coke,
coke,

1948
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:27,770
head stripper,
who's going to be a good mom.

1949
01:18:27,771 --> 01:18:29,630
You don't get somebody who's that good
an artist.

1950
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:32,720
I'm a musician without some some run in
with it.

1951
01:18:32,810 --> 01:18:35,570
Yup.
That's the weird thing about the new guy

1952
01:18:35,571 --> 01:18:38,750
took over for a black hole sun.
Who is that?

1953
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:41,270
Chris Cornell.
Chris Cornell.

1954
01:18:41,271 --> 01:18:42,200
Who was that Guy I took over?

1955
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:43,910
Black Dude.
Who's the new guy?

1956
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:45,700
Not Chris Cornell.
Chris rutger.

1957
01:18:45,810 --> 01:18:46,070
No,
no,

1958
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:46,260
no,
no,

1959
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:46,521
no,
no,

1960
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:47,450
no,
no.

1961
01:18:47,451 --> 01:18:52,180
I'm thinking of the wrong wrong guy down
in a hole down in a hole song I was in.

1962
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:54,290
Chains do took over.
Oh really?

1963
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:55,670
Yeah,
because the other guy died.

1964
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:59,570
Right and it sounds exactly like him.
Oh you can't do that.

1965
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:02,660
Well that was the point.
It was like let's have them sing the

1966
01:19:02,661 --> 01:19:05,600
songs in the same way and it's all fine,
but this guy is like,

1967
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:07,550
but that's race mixing.
That's gets guy,

1968
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,640
but this guy is full of life and hope
and interesting.

1969
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:13,520
Oh,
but then when he sings that song down at

1970
01:19:13,521 --> 01:19:14,180
a hole,
you're like,

1971
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:17,320
Oh man,
you do polities I don't think

1972
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:21,170
you could send me all the rest of the
songs.

1973
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:27,440
You know like that guy?
Yeah,

1974
01:19:27,441 --> 01:19:31,160
I believe it or not from that new dude.
That's interesting.

1975
01:19:31,161 --> 01:19:34,460
You're happy to have the job.
You ain't going to fuck this up.

1976
01:19:34,461 --> 01:19:37,670
Probably got an Asian girlfriend,
probably got an ex girlfriend.

1977
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,500
She's probably real hot.
He sounds it shows hockey like him.

1978
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:43,190
She's probably one of them Asian
girlfriends with those Mo haircuts where

1979
01:19:43,191 --> 01:19:46,550
it's like right above her eyebrow
straight across straight and then low

1980
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:49,700
mow haircuts didn't look bobby and have
a joke like that.

1981
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:52,980
Chinese people say,
how did they get their haircut?

1982
01:19:52,981 --> 01:19:57,981
Kind of like mouths.
I think Bobby Slayton for sure,

1983
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,710
but like that long silky black hair.
He's got a girlfriend like that.

1984
01:20:02,711 --> 01:20:03,400
You know that?
Yeah.

1985
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:04,550
Should I,
down to their ass.

1986
01:20:04,551 --> 01:20:05,960
They show up.
They're always in high heels.

1987
01:20:06,090 --> 01:20:08,220
Like a hipster accessory.
But Asian girl.

1988
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:09,460
Like an assassin.
Yeah,

1989
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:12,050
super hot assassin.
And some Kung Fu movie.

1990
01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:15,990
She's protecting him and she knows moves
stupid hot with like a corset on.

1991
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:19,290
What is your assessment where a
miniskirt can't be the best for

1992
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,300
mobility.
Yeah.

1993
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:24,570
And she just has a slight Asian accent.
Just light.

1994
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:27,390
Yeah.
It's first briefly then English.

1995
01:20:27,391 --> 01:20:30,480
But like you could hear a twinge of it
and she likes chicks.

1996
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:35,010
I like chicks chicks over.
Uh,

1997
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:37,470
it comes back to his dressing room.
Is three other chicks in there,

1998
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,960
baby?
We all have a potty.

1999
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:41,960
Come on baby.
Oh,

2000
01:20:41,961 --> 01:20:43,170
by the way,
that's where we're going to talk about

2001
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:45,870
how these artists are taking off stuff
off Pandora.

2002
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:47,580
Oh,
that's what we started talking about.

2003
01:20:47,581 --> 01:20:48,600
Spotify.
Spotify.

2004
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:49,261
Yeah.
Yeah.

2005
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:51,270
The,
I think black keys took the stuff down.

2006
01:20:51,271 --> 01:20:52,560
Or like you could only have her old
stuff.

2007
01:20:52,561 --> 01:20:55,830
Nothing new because they're like,
you're not really paying us well enough.

2008
01:20:55,831 --> 01:20:57,420
You only giving us access to New People.

2009
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:00,120
So for a young comedian,
people discover me from Pitt,

2010
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:02,390
from Pandora and spotify for sure.
You know,

2011
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:06,360
but um,
for someone who's got brings them money,

2012
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:09,600
then it's like at this point like you
got to pay these people.

2013
01:21:09,670 --> 01:21:12,270
And really pay everybody a fair amount.
It's a great service.

2014
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:15,360
Having something like Pandora or spotify
is great.

2015
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:18,180
It's awesome to be able to,
you don't have to illegally download

2016
01:21:18,181 --> 01:21:18,930
anymore.
Right.

2017
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:21,630
You just pretty much get,
but that's only on the idea that

2018
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:23,460
everything's going to be available.
Right.

2019
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:26,910
Well here's the problem.
Is anybody making money off of it?

2020
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:28,230
I'll spotify.
Yeah.

2021
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:30,330
Do you mean does spotify making money?
Yeah.

2022
01:21:31,690 --> 01:21:32,300
Yeah.

2023
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:33,680
10 bucks a month.
Subscriptions.

2024
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:36,770
Okay,
so and they do pay some and they have to

2025
01:21:36,771 --> 01:21:38,900
pay every artist in the world.
Rugby,

2026
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:40,850
they don't pay that much.
I don't pay very much.

2027
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,190
No.
See it's different like streaming

2028
01:21:43,191 --> 01:21:44,510
rights,
it's different.

2029
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:47,870
It's not the same as sales.
It's weird.

2030
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:53,420
So like you can have a company that
stream stuff and like the,

2031
01:21:53,421 --> 01:21:57,440
the rates that you get paid.
There was a story about like the most

2032
01:21:57,441 --> 01:22:02,441
played song on spotify and how much
actually generated.

2033
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:06,110
How much would you guess?
The most played song?

2034
01:22:06,111 --> 01:22:08,750
I'm thinking like a Taylor swift kind of
thing like that.

2035
01:22:08,810 --> 01:22:10,730
Yeah.
What I would to be fair,

2036
01:22:10,731 --> 01:22:12,810
if it's that that played on that kind
of,

2037
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:17,780
we'd want to make like 1 million bucks
off that write something on the alarms,

2038
01:22:17,781 --> 01:22:18,200
right?
Yeah.

2039
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:22,040
Or a few hundred thousand thousand 500.
I mean,

2040
01:22:22,041 --> 01:22:26,120
you would assume 5 cents a pop.
That's a really valuable thing.

2041
01:22:26,121 --> 01:22:28,900
If you're playing it millions of times.
I don't know how many times you're

2042
01:22:28,901 --> 01:22:31,010
playing it.
Got Some Camper van Beethoven said that

2043
01:22:31,011 --> 01:22:33,020
his stuff has been played way more than
that.

2044
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:33,913
Then,
uh,

2045
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:35,630
purchases.
But then he's like,

2046
01:22:35,690 --> 01:22:37,730
but you know,
they'll come see my shows now.

2047
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:38,720
Right.
Cracker on camera.

2048
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:41,840
There's definitely some benefit to it as
far as exposure.

2049
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:44,780
It's not all negative for sure not.
But does Taylor swift need that

2050
01:22:44,781 --> 01:22:45,770
exposure?
Right.

2051
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:48,680
So the question is what the UCB did.
They're like,

2052
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:50,930
we're not going to pay you because you
should be honored.

2053
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:51,531
They'll say,
well,

2054
01:22:51,531 --> 01:22:53,480
we're just barely getting by.
And then they opened up two new

2055
01:22:53,481 --> 01:22:54,690
locations after that.
Yeah.

2056
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:55,800
Those.
As soon as I found out,

2057
01:22:55,801 --> 01:22:57,170
those guys don't pay anybody.
I'm like,

2058
01:22:57,171 --> 01:22:59,360
he can soccer.
I get your fucking improv troupes.

2059
01:22:59,361 --> 01:23:01,280
Not Pains,
but these are comedians and they go,

2060
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:03,920
you should be lucky to perform at the
UCB.

2061
01:23:03,921 --> 01:23:04,850
It's like a showcase.
I'm like,

2062
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:06,010
okay,
maybe let's just

2063
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:09,040
say that's true.
Let's say me as a eight year comic when

2064
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:11,170
I was an eight year comic,
like I can get seen there.

2065
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:14,110
Sure.
But aren't you the UCB lucky to have

2066
01:23:14,111 --> 01:23:16,420
Silverman,
Sarah Sub Michelle and Zach Alfin acra

2067
01:23:16,421 --> 01:23:18,970
show up.
Like it's not just a straight,

2068
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,310
we're all lucky to be on spotify.
Right,

2069
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:22,270
exactly.
You know what I mean?

2070
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:25,030
They also need the black keys to be able
to stay relevant.

2071
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:27,970
If all the top musicians,
beyonce and the black keys and arcade

2072
01:23:27,971 --> 01:23:28,930
fire,
they'll go,

2073
01:23:28,931 --> 01:23:32,050
we're all pulling out there.
Sure.

2074
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:32,943
You know,
keep it,

2075
01:23:32,950 --> 01:23:37,950
keep it evers.
Here's seven black listeners broken now.

2076
01:23:40,570 --> 01:23:42,000
Oh,
nice way to go.

2077
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:42,881
He goes,
yeah.

2078
01:23:42,881 --> 01:23:45,730
Then they're less of place to go for all
music.

2079
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:47,890
No,
I totally agree.

2080
01:23:47,891 --> 01:23:49,270
So like just pay fairly

2081
01:23:49,430 --> 01:23:51,080
well.
We have to find out how much money they

2082
01:23:51,081 --> 01:23:54,020
make and what is it like,
what is the the most played,

2083
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,250
the most played song ever.
They just had one that got went over 500

2084
01:23:58,250 --> 01:23:59,960
million song,
100 million streams,

2085
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:01,420
what would that be?
Four to $500 million.

2086
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,400
5 cents B.
I don't think you get that much.

2087
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:05,990
How it works out though,
cause that just try to figure out the

2088
01:24:05,991 --> 01:24:08,240
math in your head a little bit.
Say there's 10 bucks a month,

2089
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:12,500
you have to have a payment for to take
care of the service itself.

2090
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:14,420
Right?
So they say that 30% fee goes to

2091
01:24:14,421 --> 01:24:17,990
spotify.
So there's a roughly 70% less than $7

2092
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:21,530
left out of that 10 so it's a different
math if you like,

2093
01:24:21,531 --> 01:24:26,030
if you play a song one song or if I
listen to only Ari Shaffir 10 times a

2094
01:24:26,031 --> 01:24:27,680
day,
30 days a month,

2095
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:31,760
you would technically get all of my $7
technically.

2096
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:35,510
But it doesn't necessarily work out that
way because if I played one joe Rogan

2097
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:36,860
Song,
he's going to get a little piece of that

2098
01:24:36,861 --> 01:24:39,020
too.
But not everyone just listens to one

2099
01:24:39,021 --> 01:24:42,200
person.
And you listened to 25 songs a day or in

2100
01:24:42,201 --> 01:24:43,420
an end?
In one hour even.

2101
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,900
Right.
And a lot of time people just let it

2102
01:24:44,901 --> 01:24:47,600
play and the they leave.
So that's like one set some things up

2103
01:24:47,601 --> 01:24:50,660
like that where they've tried to game
the system where they've tried to play

2104
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:53,810
someone song,
a new artist multiple times to try to

2105
01:24:53,811 --> 01:24:55,230
get them some money.
Oh really?

2106
01:24:55,231 --> 01:24:58,280
It doesn't necessarily work out totally
well for them that way either,

2107
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,340
but there's just not a lot of money in
it in general.

2108
01:25:01,341 --> 01:25:03,220
There's like,
there's not a lot of sales for,

2109
01:25:03,330 --> 01:25:06,290
for music and a total,
like I just have a big band.

2110
01:25:06,291 --> 01:25:09,350
I liked the def tones that they have a
new album coming out soon.

2111
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:13,160
It just announced a concert in La.
If you buy a ticket to this show,

2112
01:25:13,161 --> 01:25:16,910
you get their album for free.
Deftones um,

2113
01:25:16,970 --> 01:25:19,710
they've been out for a long time.
This show you at the outfit.

2114
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,830
That's an arcade fire did it.
But like when the show is touring for

2115
01:25:21,831 --> 01:25:23,480
the books,
but I'm going to get the album anyway.

2116
01:25:23,630 --> 01:25:26,390
I'm going to be able listen to all those
songs on Youtube,

2117
01:25:26,391 --> 01:25:28,010
on spotify,
Pandora.

2118
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:30,590
They've been around forever.
They're pretty bad ass.

2119
01:25:30,591 --> 01:25:31,540
They had some bad ass songs.

2120
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:35,240
Could you tell me
five senses but it's not,

2121
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:38,030
I can't fucking figure this calculator
how it works though.

2122
01:25:38,031 --> 01:25:39,950
What he's saying.
I just want to know what it would be on

2123
01:25:39,951 --> 01:25:42,940
radio plays.
I'm not mad at you.

2124
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:45,130
The most downloaded song,

2125
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,140
well that was,
that was the Ed Sheeran Song like

2126
01:25:48,141 --> 01:25:49,520
thinking out loud I think is what it's
called.

2127
01:25:49,521 --> 01:25:52,490
500 million in the article compared it
to a youtube would.

2128
01:25:52,491 --> 01:25:55,340
They have over 10 songs that have over a
billion plays on it.

2129
01:25:55,341 --> 01:25:58,860
How much youtube gets money because
there's ads next testing.

2130
01:25:58,890 --> 01:26:03,230
So they're getting money from the ads,
not from people using the service from a

2131
01:26:03,231 --> 01:26:04,200
subscriber and they've started

2132
01:26:04,210 --> 01:26:06,220
youtube red to try to compete with that
kind of thing too,

2133
01:26:06,221 --> 01:26:10,250
which is nine nine nine a month.
James Service thing like that too.

2134
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:15,560
It's interesting.
So there's really probably not that much

2135
01:26:15,561 --> 01:26:19,250
money that's even left over for the
artists out of that $7 kind of their

2136
01:26:19,251 --> 01:26:23,900
argument and that people are just a lot
of money in and around in general for

2137
01:26:23,901 --> 01:26:24,350
it.
All right,

2138
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:26,210
but don't they have like,
what is it called,

2139
01:26:26,211 --> 01:26:29,300
an IPO initial public offering that
haven't they do,

2140
01:26:29,301 --> 01:26:31,730
they do stuff like that with these kinds
of companies and they sell them and then

2141
01:26:31,731 --> 01:26:32,810
tech,
uh,

2142
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:35,320
sector gobbles them up and the stock
market,

2143
01:26:35,330 --> 01:26:36,740
they make a of degree and already by the
way.

2144
01:26:37,390 --> 01:26:38,440
Okay,
thank you.

2145
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:41,000
Multiple ways.
That's why I'm trying to say there's

2146
01:26:41,001 --> 01:26:45,050
deals you can have.
So like a spotify or apple music could

2147
01:26:45,051 --> 01:26:46,430
pay,
uh,

2148
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:49,850
drake for his new album to come out
exclusively on apple music.

2149
01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:51,980
And that's the best.
That's the only way you can get it.

2150
01:26:51,981 --> 01:26:54,230
That's what Kanya is sorta tried to do
with title right now.

2151
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:56,420
Exclusively exclusivity.
So it's like we have it.

2152
01:26:56,421 --> 01:26:57,350
No one else has it.
Right.

2153
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,150
And then you're like,
well,

2154
01:26:59,151 --> 01:27:00,830
if I want,
this is the only way I can get this new

2155
01:27:00,831 --> 01:27:02,780
thing.
I got to get Amazon prime or I've got to

2156
01:27:02,781 --> 01:27:05,720
get apple play or I got to get this.
I don't like that because everyone has

2157
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:08,480
their own gaming system.
It sucks when it only comes out only on

2158
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:09,373
xbox.
Right.

2159
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:10,250
It's like,
come on man,

2160
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:11,990
we're not going to fucking buy a
playstation.

2161
01:27:11,991 --> 01:27:15,860
We already have an x box.
Some people that use android phones,

2162
01:27:15,861 --> 01:27:20,150
like my friend Louis unbox therapy,
he was telling me that he avoids using

2163
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:22,250
itunes.
We're having this conversation.

2164
01:27:22,251 --> 01:27:25,700
I was asking him about phones today
cause there was a threat of my message

2165
01:27:25,701 --> 01:27:29,660
board where people getting mad at Brian
for talking shit about the Samsung

2166
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:32,690
Galaxy s seven and that he was going to
switch over to it,

2167
01:27:32,691 --> 01:27:35,540
but I know he switches over to different
phones like every couple of months and

2168
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:36,800
write stories about this Guy Louis.

2169
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:39,780
Oh,
unbox therapy's a website where he said

2170
01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:42,780
you got a youtube channel on a website,
but what he does is he,

2171
01:27:42,830 --> 01:27:45,680
he reviews tech stuff.
He takes it out of the box and tries it

2172
01:27:45,681 --> 01:27:48,380
and he talks about it and he knows a lot
of shit about technology.

2173
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,690
He describes,
he's thinks he's describing it from a

2174
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:52,750
very educated point of view and then he
takes that phone.

2175
01:27:52,751 --> 01:27:53,420
He's like,
okay,

2176
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:56,180
I'm going to use this as my main phone
for like a month or something like that.

2177
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:59,120
That's just like,
oh fuck,

2178
01:27:59,121 --> 01:28:00,160
I didn't realize this problem.
Yeah.

2179
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:01,580
Tell you what's annoying,
what's not.

2180
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,550
And he said he doesn't,
even though he uses like Mac computers,

2181
01:28:04,551 --> 01:28:08,000
he doesn't use itunes because itunes
specific to one platform and that's

2182
01:28:08,001 --> 01:28:10,100
annoying specific warren platform.
Well,

2183
01:28:10,101 --> 01:28:13,280
you can't get itunes like you,
you like if you want to use like,

2184
01:28:13,281 --> 01:28:14,990
you want to watch movies and shit like
that.

2185
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:16,560
I don't think you can necessarily do
that on a,

2186
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:18,500
on an android phone.
Oh yeah.

2187
01:28:18,501 --> 01:28:21,420
A lot of people,
when I tweet my podcast or she first got

2188
01:28:21,421 --> 01:28:22,350
to tech,
um,

2189
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:23,450
uh,
they go,

2190
01:28:23,690 --> 01:28:25,700
don't give me the itunes link.
I can't use that.

2191
01:28:25,830 --> 01:28:27,590
I'm going to android.
Yeah.

2192
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:30,830
It's like 55% of the downloads use
itunes,

2193
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:33,440
but 45% don't.
That's a lot.

2194
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:34,303
Yeah.
Yeah.

2195
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,430
I see the most important one.
But it doesn't mean it's the only one.

2196
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:40,670
It's not,
but it's easy to use the other 30% of

2197
01:28:40,671 --> 01:28:43,640
your income to,
so if you sell an album for 10 bucks,

2198
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:46,580
itunes gets $3 of that rubber that's not
relevant.

2199
01:28:46,581 --> 01:28:48,110
And podcasts,
podcasts,

2200
01:28:48,111 --> 01:28:50,360
yeah.
But in like music and sales and stuff.

2201
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:51,710
Right.
And record sales.

2202
01:28:51,711 --> 01:28:52,544
It's a big deal.
Yeah,

2203
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:54,800
that's a big deal.
But they do provide that same sort of

2204
01:28:54,801 --> 01:28:56,960
service,
it seems like if they take 30% it's

2205
01:28:56,961 --> 01:28:58,850
probably similar to how spotify is
talking about.

2206
01:28:58,850 --> 01:29:01,130
They take,
I mean they're providing a distribution

2207
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:05,550
labrador down there,
keeping it up and it's a secure,

2208
01:29:05,610 --> 01:29:09,990
stable platform that like the
application that comes with your iphone,

2209
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:11,790
you're not going to get any better than
that.

2210
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:16,410
I've had a podcast apps spotify as free
for most people.

2211
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,300
Right.
You just have to listen to an ad.

2212
01:29:18,301 --> 01:29:19,710
So then they get ad revenue.
Okay,

2213
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:24,510
go ahead David ad revenue and then you
could also subscribe if you like get rid

2214
01:29:24,511 --> 01:29:26,620
of,
they get rid of the ads that we can

2215
01:29:26,621 --> 01:29:29,670
still make money off you.
We don't have to get the ads every 10

2216
01:29:29,671 --> 01:29:31,260
minutes.
So apple does that now too.

2217
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:34,200
They have a streaming music site
service.

2218
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:39,530
So what Louis was saying is he uses
Amazon prime and Google play because

2219
01:29:39,901 --> 01:29:42,220
they're not platform specific.
Yeah,

2220
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:44,880
use tweeted a link to a new song,
grimes or something.

2221
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,520
He was like,
anybody who put the apple play one on

2222
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:50,220
the go click on it and you're like,
but now I have to pay for apple play to

2223
01:29:50,221 --> 01:29:50,890
play it.

2224
01:29:50,890 --> 01:29:51,723
And he was like,
man,

2225
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,160
that's fucked.
I know thing.

2226
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:55,140
Yeah.
It's annoying.

2227
01:29:55,141 --> 01:29:57,900
Like when you go to a website to read an
article and they say they need your

2228
01:29:58,260 --> 01:29:59,760
email address first.
Fuck,

2229
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:00,841
I'm out.
I'm out.

2230
01:30:00,841 --> 01:30:04,350
But you fuck you.
[inaudible] David Taylor's theory is

2231
01:30:04,351 --> 01:30:06,660
that,
that's why anyone still has hotmail.

2232
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,500
It's for,
you're like,

2233
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:08,940
sure.
Here's my email address.

2234
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:11,310
Go ahead and use that one.
Yeah.

2235
01:30:11,550 --> 01:30:13,730
It's just a spam filter.
Yeah.

2236
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:18,360
Well just for like a website that you
don't give a fuck about.

2237
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,580
Yeah.
An email address that you just,

2238
01:30:20,581 --> 01:30:22,290
a burner email address.
Oh yeah.

2239
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:24,443
Yeah.
I don't,

2240
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:26,640
I don't think the future is in,
um,

2241
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:30,390
getting people to pay for shit.
I think it's super hard to get people to

2242
01:30:30,391 --> 01:30:31,320
pay for shipping for sure.
Well,

2243
01:30:31,321 --> 01:30:32,160
it's,
it's the online,

2244
01:30:32,161 --> 01:30:35,520
I talked to Aubrey about this a long
time ago and if you're a store

2245
01:30:35,790 --> 01:30:36,511
[inaudible],
you know,

2246
01:30:36,511 --> 01:30:38,610
and you were buying two shirts,
right.

2247
01:30:38,610 --> 01:30:40,500
You know,
and then you're in line right there.

2248
01:30:40,530 --> 01:30:42,280
Like you were at starbucks yesterday and
you see these,

2249
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:42,780
uh,
these,

2250
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:44,940
the pad chargers,
like how much did it like 10 bucks.

2251
01:30:44,941 --> 01:30:45,151
Like,
Oh,

2252
01:30:45,151 --> 01:30:46,310
maybe I'll get one.
Right.

2253
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:49,110
You already got your Wallet Open.
And that was actually more than we were

2254
01:30:49,111 --> 01:30:51,480
spending on coffee,
but I didn't buy it.

2255
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:53,400
You didn't buy it,
but it wouldn't be the biggest deal if

2256
01:30:53,401 --> 01:30:54,750
you did.
It was a bad example.

2257
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:55,801
But if you're like,
hey,

2258
01:30:55,801 --> 01:30:57,060
would you also like this?
I'm socks up.

2259
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:57,451
Yeah,
sure.

2260
01:30:57,451 --> 01:31:01,650
I'll get some socks too.
But to open up your wallet is like a way

2261
01:31:01,651 --> 01:31:04,080
bigger deal.
Even a 99 cent APP.

2262
01:31:04,110 --> 01:31:04,801
A lot of people go like,
well,

2263
01:31:04,801 --> 01:31:06,960
let me read the reviews,
you know,

2264
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:09,270
let me look at this as a good app.
You know what I'm talking about?

2265
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:14,160
It's like strange though.
For $1 is you're way less likely to

2266
01:31:14,161 --> 01:31:15,030
spend it online.

2267
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:18,840
Then 10 bucks in a store.
It's just hard to get people to actually

2268
01:31:18,841 --> 01:31:20,360
open up that eat wallet.
And what,

2269
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:21,920
same thing with email or justice where
it's like,

2270
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:23,280
oh,
I don't want to sign up for this stuff,

2271
01:31:23,281 --> 01:31:23,761
man.
Well,

2272
01:31:23,761 --> 01:31:26,310
a lot of times you don't have an ego
wall at either.

2273
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:29,790
A lot of times you're just entering in
all the individual credit card

2274
01:31:29,791 --> 01:31:32,160
information every time.
That's what I mean.

2275
01:31:32,161 --> 01:31:33,530
That's what I mean.
Like to open up your,

2276
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:36,150
to pay anything online.
But you know,

2277
01:31:36,151 --> 01:31:37,770
apple has an [inaudible] wallet.
Oh,

2278
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,090
real wallet feature.
Yeah.

2279
01:31:39,390 --> 01:31:41,700
While you can actually buy things with
your phone.

2280
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:43,140
Oh,
that stuff now.

2281
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:44,160
And they put,
they came out with,

2282
01:31:44,161 --> 01:31:45,630
at first it was android,
right?

2283
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:48,250
Android pay was first and then the apple
player was,

2284
01:31:48,490 --> 01:31:50,730
took over.
Whatever the fuck android calls it.

2285
01:31:50,731 --> 01:31:52,490
What do they call it?
I don't know.

2286
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:55,740
But they've been doing that on some
phones for a while.

2287
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:58,590
I've seen people buy shit and it's
annoying as fuck be behind them because

2288
01:31:58,591 --> 01:32:00,460
it doesn't,
that doesn't eat when you're at the,

2289
01:32:00,461 --> 01:32:01,540
uh,
it's okay.

2290
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:03,310
When you had the,
if you've ever seen that,

2291
01:32:03,311 --> 01:32:04,620
when they do that at starbucks.
Yeah.

2292
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:06,610
Chai scan,
it fucking doesn't work.

2293
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:10,770
Yeah.
Just stop it as annoying ones in the

2294
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:12,400
middle of a conversation.
Someone's that can get a picture and

2295
01:32:12,401 --> 01:32:12,970
you're like,
sure.

2296
01:32:12,970 --> 01:32:13,751
And then they're like,
hold on,

2297
01:32:13,751 --> 01:32:14,411
hold on,
hold on,

2298
01:32:14,411 --> 01:32:15,280
hold on.
Let me find out.

2299
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:16,460
Oh,
I got to delete some photos.

2300
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:17,560
Oh,
it's the worst.

2301
01:32:17,561 --> 01:32:21,280
And then align forms.
We're going to say Jamie Disney armband.

2302
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:23,350
I haven't been at the time.
And I've heard,

2303
01:32:23,351 --> 01:32:24,910
I've heard some things about this
recently.

2304
01:32:24,911 --> 01:32:28,030
There's some sort of like wristband.
You can get a wristband for your kids

2305
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:31,300
when you use it to pay for everything at
Disney.

2306
01:32:31,301 --> 01:32:33,220
So we don't take your wallet.
All transactions.

2307
01:32:33,221 --> 01:32:35,340
It's getting on your rides.
It's your fast pass or fail.

2308
01:32:35,450 --> 01:32:37,060
Yes.
Oh Wow.

2309
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:39,670
The technology,
and I've heard this coming.

2310
01:32:39,970 --> 01:32:42,340
I bleed into some other places too.
Whoa.

2311
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:44,980
He just got to set up a perfect
experience for you too.

2312
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:47,950
Well that's one of the reasons why we're
resisting this Apple Watch thing.

2313
01:32:47,950 --> 01:32:50,530
That red ban has a chimes off every
hour.

2314
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:54,460
He couldn't figure it out when people
send them text message with chime and

2315
01:32:54,461 --> 01:32:55,870
you couldn't figure out how to shut it
off,

2316
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:57,400
figure it out.
No,

2317
01:32:57,460 --> 01:32:58,810
that means it's hard to figure out
what's bad.

2318
01:32:59,120 --> 01:32:59,953
It's not good.
Right.

2319
01:33:00,130 --> 01:33:01,330
He's like,
how's it shut off?

2320
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:03,100
And I'm like,
I don't want my fucking,

2321
01:33:03,101 --> 01:33:04,450
because that's where it's going to go,
man.

2322
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:07,190
And then that thing's going to be used
to buy things and then someone's going

2323
01:33:07,191 --> 01:33:10,240
to come stand next to you and steal all
your fucking credit card information off

2324
01:33:10,241 --> 01:33:11,920
your phone.
They already know how to do that.

2325
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:15,000
This is already a way well,
won't work with Arash fear,

2326
01:33:15,001 --> 01:33:16,300
ladies and gentlemen.
You know why?

2327
01:33:16,450 --> 01:33:20,170
Cause ours you fear has off flip phone.
I told it to burb what's we're having

2328
01:33:20,171 --> 01:33:21,220
this conversation it goes,
yeah,

2329
01:33:21,230 --> 01:33:22,050
yeah,
yeah.

2330
01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:22,750
They had cancer.

2331
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:25,950
That dick tie it at the new ones don't
give you the cancer,

2332
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:28,030
that deck.
I don't think he's correct.

2333
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,760
I don't know.
I think it's probably exactly the same

2334
01:33:30,761 --> 01:33:31,950
amount of radiation.
Well,

2335
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:33,250
you've shown us that was the,
uh,

2336
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,550
the Disney magic band is what it's
called.

2337
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:37,451
Oh,
okay.

2338
01:33:37,451 --> 01:33:39,250
So it's like a fitbit,
so that,

2339
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:40,200
that kind of a thing.
Yeah.

2340
01:33:40,210 --> 01:33:42,120
But there's like,
there's a lot of extra things in it.

2341
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:44,620
It's not just unlocked the door of your
hotel room.

2342
01:33:44,650 --> 01:33:46,570
Yup.
Such your key for your car.

2343
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,140
Ooh,
whoa.

2344
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:51,820
The thought about that though.
Nobody said,

2345
01:33:51,821 --> 01:33:53,270
well,
what are some of the loses it right,

2346
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:56,020
but they probably don't know what your
room is unless you're going to go up and

2347
01:33:56,021 --> 01:34:01,021
down the fucking hallways every door.
I went to her room,

2348
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:03,090
I went in there,
tried the key,

2349
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:05,680
open it up,
and then it's just some guys staring at

2350
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:06,640
me from in the bed.

2351
01:34:06,670 --> 01:34:08,980
They gave you the wrong thing.
Oh my God.

2352
01:34:08,981 --> 01:34:10,990
That's amazing dude.
Staring and I'm like,

2353
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:13,270
sorry.
Um Oh,

2354
01:34:13,271 --> 01:34:16,540
it was weird.
That's happened to me before.

2355
01:34:16,810 --> 01:34:17,643
Yeah.
Yeah.

2356
01:34:17,950 --> 01:34:19,390
Oh,
so anyway,

2357
01:34:19,391 --> 01:34:23,140
so they want you to put your podcast on
spotify.

2358
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:26,680
Yeah,
they have podcasts on there now and I've

2359
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:29,240
resisted.
Hmm.

2360
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:32,650
I just don't know if it's a,
I mean you're a precedent set or at some

2361
01:34:32,651 --> 01:34:33,750
point,
well it's,

2362
01:34:33,790 --> 01:34:35,680
I don't know if it's necessarily
beneficial.

2363
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:37,540
I mean,
I guess more people who are able to have

2364
01:34:37,541 --> 01:34:39,160
access to it,
but I don't know.

2365
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:40,990
Do they edit it?
Do they put ads in it?

2366
01:34:40,991 --> 01:34:43,440
I don't know about that.
They are expanding.

2367
01:34:43,441 --> 01:34:46,240
Are there some uh,
shows you can watch on there and there's

2368
01:34:46,241 --> 01:34:49,330
this one video aspect coming through
there.

2369
01:34:49,570 --> 01:34:53,950
I liked that fact that it's available as
a regular MP three and you can do

2370
01:34:53,951 --> 01:34:55,450
whatever the fuck you want to do with
it.

2371
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:57,770
You could watch it while it's live on
youtube,

2372
01:34:58,170 --> 01:35:00,320
can watch it later or you can just
download it.

2373
01:35:00,321 --> 01:35:01,790
And if you want to download through
itunes,

2374
01:35:01,791 --> 01:35:03,290
go ahead.
If you want to download it through

2375
01:35:03,291 --> 01:35:05,690
spotify,
that seems like a different thing

2376
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,910
because that's like a service that's
like a new,

2377
01:35:08,090 --> 01:35:09,140
it's a company.
It's like,

2378
01:35:09,141 --> 01:35:10,000
then you're there,
you're,

2379
01:35:10,030 --> 01:35:12,860
you're selling content.
You're like a content provider,

2380
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:13,753
right.
Spotify.

2381
01:35:14,770 --> 01:35:16,850
And that's what they are.
They're content providers,

2382
01:35:16,851 --> 01:35:18,800
but they don't create,
they're not content creators.

2383
01:35:19,070 --> 01:35:22,310
They probably will have actually like
Netflix,

2384
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:24,060
right?
Maybe things like,

2385
01:35:24,190 --> 01:35:26,470
well,
if anyone could just get all the,

2386
01:35:26,860 --> 01:35:28,760
the videos,
then we have to do something.

2387
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:32,360
Netflix is constantly stepped up
constantly.

2388
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:34,550
I mean from drop shipping.
Yeah.

2389
01:35:34,870 --> 01:35:36,350
You know,
cd videos,

2390
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:37,430
dv,
Abrahms,

2391
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:39,530
whatever that is.
Streaming.

2392
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:40,360
Yeah.
And then they go,

2393
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:40,930
ah,
no,

2394
01:35:40,930 --> 01:35:41,750
we're,
we're done with that.

2395
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:43,160
Blockbuster.
We'd put you out of business.

2396
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:45,380
And this isn't when people are
downloading stuff too much.

2397
01:35:45,381 --> 01:35:46,214
So,
uh,

2398
01:35:46,350 --> 01:35:47,960
we'll still do that a little bit,
but let's,

2399
01:35:47,961 --> 01:35:49,190
uh,
just get all,

2400
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,590
every pretty much entertainment,
every documentary,

2401
01:35:51,591 --> 01:35:53,800
every old Sitcom.
Let's just get it all on our thing so

2402
01:35:53,801 --> 01:35:56,030
you can come to us and then other people
start going,

2403
01:35:56,031 --> 01:35:57,560
well,
why can't we just do that?

2404
01:35:58,190 --> 01:35:59,370
You know,
apple tv made the,

2405
01:35:59,390 --> 01:36:02,030
made the apple TV,
apple made the appletv and then fx and

2406
01:36:02,031 --> 01:36:03,460
people like,
let's pull this stuff back.

2407
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:06,050
Let's make it on our own APP.
You can come to our APP for watch it.

2408
01:36:06,170 --> 01:36:08,600
Yeah.
So netflix sees that and like we'd have,

2409
01:36:08,601 --> 01:36:11,630
we need a reason for you to come to us.
Let's make house of cards.

2410
01:36:12,410 --> 01:36:16,460
Let's make these interesting,
cool shows with no like TV standards

2411
01:36:16,461 --> 01:36:19,040
they have to abide by.
LikeF is for family.

2412
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:21,470
Yeah.
When you see a hard curse,

2413
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:24,140
a hard fuck,
you buy a cartoon.

2414
01:36:24,141 --> 01:36:24,891
Yeah.
You're like,

2415
01:36:24,891 --> 01:36:26,290
what?
Yeah.

2416
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:27,920
It's like,
oh my God.

2417
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:30,290
Not only that,
they can do whatever nudity they want,

2418
01:36:30,291 --> 01:36:32,390
whatever they want,
any content they want,

2419
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:33,800
whatever they want to talk about,
they can.

2420
01:36:33,801 --> 01:36:35,380
It's up to them with the readiness and
they want to put it out.

2421
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:36,141
They want to tell you,
hey,

2422
01:36:36,141 --> 01:36:37,580
be careful of this or they don't want to
tell you.

2423
01:36:37,690 --> 01:36:39,170
Let's see herself figured out.
Kid.

2424
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:40,400
They don't have to.
Megan Kelly,

2425
01:36:40,401 --> 01:36:44,660
you make it tell you the Santa Claus.
Santa Claus is real kids and he's white.

2426
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:51,860
Is this 2000 and whatever?
Fuck it was when this happened.

2427
01:36:51,861 --> 01:36:56,060
15 was that a 15 story?
I think stop.

2428
01:36:56,270 --> 01:36:58,610
We can't do this anymore by the way.
I'll be in Tempe,

2429
01:36:58,611 --> 01:37:00,140
Arizona this Thursday.
Friday,

2430
01:37:00,141 --> 01:37:01,300
Saturday.
Doppler radar.

2431
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:03,890
I like cheese.
Tempe,

2432
01:37:03,891 --> 01:37:06,380
Arizona.
The home of my first Netflix special.

2433
01:37:07,310 --> 01:37:10,250
I recorded that there in 2005 really?
Yeah man.

2434
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:12,890
The one where I talked about how stupid
Bush was.

2435
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:16,490
Yeah.
They keep playing that now with this

2436
01:37:16,491 --> 01:37:20,720
election because I said you know that I
think what happened like after he got

2437
01:37:20,721 --> 01:37:23,090
elected a second time,
they were probably sitting in the back

2438
01:37:23,091 --> 01:37:24,860
of the room going we can think we go
down.

2439
01:37:24,990 --> 01:37:27,080
Oh yeah I remember that pet.
Yeah I remember that bit.

2440
01:37:27,230 --> 01:37:30,200
And then boom cause it was a really good
job of

2441
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:34,400
like I have,
I've told you this before,

2442
01:37:34,401 --> 01:37:36,710
but using your voice the way you did
that and that bit was like,

2443
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:42,300
it was like four years past and they all
look and they go wait.

2444
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:46,940
It's like that quiet thing,
a pause mixed by quiet instead of just

2445
01:37:46,941 --> 01:37:49,700
talking.
They can flex up and down at flection.

2446
01:37:49,790 --> 01:37:51,230
You're just really good at it.
Well thank you.

2447
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:54,260
I just put myself in the position of
that actually happening.

2448
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:57,990
That's what I try to like what would it
be like if there really was this cabal

2449
01:37:57,991 --> 01:38:02,991
of evil billionaires that's trying to
control the mindset in program the

2450
01:38:03,181 --> 01:38:06,900
entire country and they wanted to put a
dumb person office so they could figure

2451
01:38:06,901 --> 01:38:08,010
out how dumb people were.
Like,

2452
01:38:08,011 --> 01:38:09,110
that was the premise of the joke.
Yeah.

2453
01:38:09,111 --> 01:38:10,890
There's only one way to figure out how
stupid people are.

2454
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:13,260
And you can watch the news,
you can see what movies they buy.

2455
01:38:13,530 --> 01:38:17,040
But the only real way is to put a dumb
person in as president and see if

2456
01:38:17,041 --> 01:38:18,630
everybody freaks out.
Yeah.

2457
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:21,900
Because if they don't freak out,
it's because they're dumber than him.

2458
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:23,730
They don't even know he's dumb.
He's like,

2459
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:26,100
that's a weird thing about being really
fucking stupid.

2460
01:38:26,101 --> 01:38:27,450
You don't know what to do with it.
Yeah.

2461
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:29,940
So the only way,
the premise of the bit was the only way

2462
01:38:29,941 --> 01:38:33,690
we could really find out how stupid
America was was to put a really dumb guy

2463
01:38:33,691 --> 01:38:35,430
in as president.
And there's many,

2464
01:38:35,431 --> 01:38:39,470
many really articulate whip,
smart Republican candidates that could

2465
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:41,010
easily make a great leader.
Like,

2466
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:42,270
well,
why would they do that?

2467
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:44,350
They can't find how stupid we are.
If we do that,

2468
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:46,890
that'd be a backup plan.
Let's see if we can get the dummy in

2469
01:38:46,891 --> 01:38:49,830
first.
And then after he won a second term,

2470
01:38:49,831 --> 01:38:52,050
that's when the bit was like,
I think we can go down there.

2471
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:53,520
So now they are,
uh,

2472
01:38:53,550 --> 01:38:56,040
they're using that to illustrate Donald
Trump or something.

2473
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:57,470
Yeah.
Band.

2474
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:59,550
They've made too many comparisons to
presidential candidates.

2475
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:01,920
The Hitler that it's like,
guys,

2476
01:39:01,921 --> 01:39:05,340
it does your to kicking doing it.
You said Bush was Hitler.

2477
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:07,110
You know,
that's like look enough,

2478
01:39:07,111 --> 01:39:09,990
like the hat comedy premise from hell
from hell.

2479
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:13,440
She's like the strip are from how,
and at some point it's like,

2480
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:15,540
well hell doesn't seem that bad to be
honest.

2481
01:39:15,541 --> 01:39:20,541
You're overusing this.
But it was a really easy way to get away

2482
01:39:21,451 --> 01:39:24,510
with like saying something's bad.
Like for a long time.

2483
01:39:24,511 --> 01:39:27,930
Like in the 80s in particular,
it was a knockout punch.

2484
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:29,520
Everything time.
Yeah.

2485
01:39:29,610 --> 01:39:32,610
The something from hell,
I can't believe he's saying how people

2486
01:39:32,611 --> 01:39:33,990
back then.
Whoa.

2487
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:35,460
Slow down.
Audrey,

2488
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:39,690
push on steroids
on crack.

2489
01:39:39,890 --> 01:39:41,170
Crack is another one.
Yup.

2490
01:39:41,210 --> 01:39:43,230
Yup.
Let's say the same thing,

2491
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:45,810
but say it slightly different.
So it seems like we're original,

2492
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:47,190
right?
Exactly.

2493
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:49,770
Yeah.
It's still on in one word.

2494
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:51,150
Well,
I mean,

2495
01:39:51,390 --> 01:39:54,090
if,
if it's just a very minor part of what

2496
01:39:54,091 --> 01:39:56,970
you're trying to describe,
I guess it's fine to use it as a non

2497
01:39:56,971 --> 01:40:00,570
creative narrative or noncreative a
descriptive,

2498
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:03,870
but when it's,
when you're doing it a lot,

2499
01:40:05,370 --> 01:40:08,590
I think too much
overuse.

2500
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:12,000
Yeah.
I wonder how much this is going to

2501
01:40:12,001 --> 01:40:15,990
change everything the way Donald Trump
is running for president.

2502
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:17,520
Well,
here's what I saw from it.

2503
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:19,740
So before,
I mean,

2504
01:40:19,741 --> 01:40:21,780
I'm assuming in the Lincoln Times,
you know,

2505
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,550
they were just,
the candidates would just say their

2506
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:24,384
opinions,
so what they,

2507
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:26,910
what they thought and that's what the
newspaper print and that'd be the end of

2508
01:40:26,911 --> 01:40:28,200
it.
They would go out and talk for hours

2509
01:40:28,201 --> 01:40:28,920
too.
Yeah,

2510
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:30,090
sure.
Stomping him,

2511
01:40:30,091 --> 01:40:30,851
do whatever.
No,

2512
01:40:30,851 --> 01:40:32,700
no microphones.
No microphones.

2513
01:40:32,790 --> 01:40:33,451
Wow.
Oh yeah.

2514
01:40:33,451 --> 01:40:35,550
No microphones.
Just get up there and talk.

2515
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:39,300
Hopefully the acoustics aren't terrible,
but mostly it's probably outside.

2516
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:43,500
People Fart and take a train to the next
state to try to convince them.

2517
01:40:43,690 --> 01:40:47,160
By the time your speech has done,
half the people are dead for malaria,

2518
01:40:47,190 --> 01:40:50,790
they just die.
And then it became a thing where like

2519
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:53,920
Bill Clinton went on Arsenio Hall and he
played

2520
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:55,360
a trumpet,
trumpet,

2521
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:56,620
saxophone.
That's what it was.

2522
01:40:56,770 --> 01:41:00,190
And his ratings went up like 10 points
over night and we're like,

2523
01:41:00,191 --> 01:41:02,320
wait a minute,
this has nothing to do with the issues.

2524
01:41:03,130 --> 01:41:07,180
And so there was this mixture of
showmanship and issues and I think

2525
01:41:07,181 --> 01:41:10,090
trump's theory,
his thesis is guys,

2526
01:41:10,091 --> 01:41:13,810
I don't think the your platform matters
as much as the showmanship.

2527
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:18,910
I think it's only showmanship.
Well also it's who else is running.

2528
01:41:19,100 --> 01:41:20,270
Sure.
And what Ted Cruz,

2529
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:21,820
have you seen those videos?
Ted Cruz made?

2530
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:24,160
Yeah,
the commercials when they show the

2531
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:24,950
outtakes,
all,

2532
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:27,700
all the people hugging and stuff.
And the best is the wife,

2533
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:29,740
the,
his mom going like,

2534
01:41:29,741 --> 01:41:32,060
she prays for me and she's like,
mm hmm.

2535
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:33,250
He goes,
sometimes,

2536
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:34,810
you know,
hours a day.

2537
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:39,030
She was like,
oh well I don't like the look of like of

2538
01:41:39,030 --> 01:41:39,341
hours.
And she goes,

2539
01:41:39,341 --> 01:41:40,390
where are you going with us a day?

2540
01:41:40,390 --> 01:41:43,450
Just got cut mom.
Mom,

2541
01:41:43,630 --> 01:41:47,320
stick to the script.
You shape or pious and I'm not gay.

2542
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:48,730
Right.
And

2543
01:41:52,390 --> 01:41:54,460
the old thing is so crazy.
This is like,

2544
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:59,880
I think Bernie's the only one talking
about shit that actually American people

2545
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:04,750
day to day have to deal with.
He's definitely talking more about

2546
01:42:04,751 --> 01:42:05,980
social issues.
Yeah.

2547
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:08,470
I would like to talk,
I say socialism,

2548
01:42:08,471 --> 01:42:10,900
like it's a bad word,
but it's just social issues.

2549
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:12,670
Well,
yeah,

2550
01:42:12,671 --> 01:42:17,671
but socialism isn't just social issues.
Socialism implies some sort of a

2551
01:42:17,801 --> 01:42:21,790
community pot of money that we're going
to distribute to people.

2552
01:42:21,791 --> 01:42:24,850
Do they distributors that now and we use
80% of it for defense?

2553
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:26,590
Yeah.
Oh well that's just all offense.

2554
01:42:26,670 --> 01:42:28,930
But that's the problem that people find
with this.

2555
01:42:28,931 --> 01:42:31,240
The big problem that I've heard from
people that actually understand it,

2556
01:42:31,241 --> 01:42:33,880
not folks like you and me,
but people that actually understand it,

2557
01:42:33,881 --> 01:42:35,980
they're like,
the problem is it just makes government

2558
01:42:35,981 --> 01:42:39,640
bigger because what he's doing is
proposing that we get more taxes from

2559
01:42:39,641 --> 01:42:42,530
people and somehow or another it's going
to create more programs and that there's

2560
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:44,200
more programs going to trickle down to
the people.

2561
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:45,910
It's like,
but the problem is here's what I

2562
01:42:45,930 --> 01:42:48,320
understand,
but you take more taxes from people and

2563
01:42:48,321 --> 01:42:50,650
you're just giving it to the government.
And then they have to be competent.

2564
01:42:50,651 --> 01:42:52,780
All of a sudden you're never been
competent before.

2565
01:42:52,810 --> 01:42:54,640
Right.
There's a Co somebody on my message

2566
01:42:54,641 --> 01:42:56,710
board brought this up,
like the Department of fish and game

2567
01:42:56,711 --> 01:43:00,010
that I always praise them for the
conservation efforts that they've done.

2568
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:03,760
They've got all big wildlife biologists
running it.

2569
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:04,631
Right.
You know,

2570
01:43:04,631 --> 01:43:07,240
like these are like actual scientists,
not a writer.

2571
01:43:07,241 --> 01:43:11,470
Ocracy they hired some really smart
people care about the environment to run

2572
01:43:11,471 --> 01:43:16,030
these fish and wildlife department.
So let's say people say like that would

2573
01:43:16,031 --> 01:43:17,140
never work and go,
okay,

2574
01:43:17,141 --> 01:43:19,060
fine.
Maybe like how's it has no,

2575
01:43:19,150 --> 01:43:20,350
but here's the,
here's the reality.

2576
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:24,070
What we have now is not working.
People are getting poorer and poorer.

2577
01:43:24,260 --> 01:43:26,380
See,
wildlife biologists are very different

2578
01:43:26,381 --> 01:43:27,214
than economist.

2579
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:29,530
Yeah.
So when you get a wildlife biologist,

2580
01:43:29,531 --> 01:43:32,560
it's trying to manage the buffalo
population and they try to figure out,

2581
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:33,701
hey,
you know,

2582
01:43:33,701 --> 01:43:35,860
we've got wolves in yellowstone that are
killing the buffalo.

2583
01:43:35,861 --> 01:43:38,530
We've got to figure out how to do it.
And then they try to find work arounds.

2584
01:43:38,590 --> 01:43:41,620
They do all sorts of different things to
try to maintain healthy populations.

2585
01:43:41,710 --> 01:43:43,390
There's no profit in that.
So profit.

2586
01:43:43,570 --> 01:43:45,940
Yeah.
See now the problem with anything

2587
01:43:45,941 --> 01:43:50,650
economic is there's all sorts of
motivating factors that lead up to rules

2588
01:43:50,651 --> 01:43:55,651
that get past that allow these people
that become president or become,

2589
01:43:56,210 --> 01:43:57,320
you know,
whatever the fuck they're doing,

2590
01:43:57,321 --> 01:44:00,230
where they're making deals with people
like the bankers that are paying Hillary

2591
01:44:00,230 --> 01:44:04,130
Clinton $250,000 they get them into
these positions and then they can,

2592
01:44:04,190 --> 01:44:07,370
they can profit insanely.
They get these positions on these,

2593
01:44:07,371 --> 01:44:09,230
these guys go from,
this guy was a great,

2594
01:44:09,710 --> 01:44:13,340
it's a great documentary called inside
job and it's all about the Wall Street

2595
01:44:13,341 --> 01:44:18,341
collapse and this guy who was like this
very educated financial guy is

2596
01:44:19,041 --> 01:44:22,370
interviewing these people and picking
them apart as he's interviewing them and

2597
01:44:22,371 --> 01:44:23,990
you see,
they start to panic and they start to

2598
01:44:23,991 --> 01:44:26,090
freak out and some of them go on,
you know,

2599
01:44:26,091 --> 01:44:27,500
I'm going to only have one more
question.

2600
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:30,380
Then I'm going to leave in the beginning
of the interview of they're all smiles

2601
01:44:30,381 --> 01:44:34,070
and happy and these are economists and
he finds out that these guys who were

2602
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:38,060
economy professors went on to get jobs
with these banks.

2603
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:41,630
So they set these rules like,
well we've chest checked with the,

2604
01:44:41,631 --> 01:44:44,270
you know,
Blah Blah Blah University economics

2605
01:44:44,271 --> 01:44:46,420
department and they recommend this,
that and that.

2606
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:51,500
So they get,
they move into cushy jobs where they get

2607
01:44:51,501 --> 01:44:53,750
paid millions of dollars once they
leave.

2608
01:44:53,751 --> 01:44:56,390
These government positions are these
teaching positions?

2609
01:44:57,050 --> 01:44:58,940
Very,
very fascinating stuff.

2610
01:44:58,941 --> 01:45:02,690
Cause it shows there's motivation and as
soon as there's motivation for profit,

2611
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:06,290
everything gets girly.
So Clinton can say all day and have some

2612
01:45:06,291 --> 01:45:06,831
cash.
I'm like,

2613
01:45:06,831 --> 01:45:09,050
well I'll try to,
Clinton can say all day that she has,

2614
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:13,520
they don't influence her.
Well then they don't take on nature.

2615
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:15,110
Yeah.
You can't take that much money to talk.

2616
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:15,973
Yeah.

2617
01:45:16,490 --> 01:45:17,860
I don't know.
I do know it's like I don't,

2618
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:19,250
we,
neither one of us really understand it,

2619
01:45:19,251 --> 01:45:20,630
but I don't see Bernie as a guy was
like,

2620
01:45:20,730 --> 01:45:23,100
let's just do our morning.
I'm sure it'll work out well.

2621
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:24,920
It's not about impression.
It's not about,

2622
01:45:25,130 --> 01:45:26,930
it's not bad for,
they're trying to,

2623
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:30,090
not that I would like Mrs. Clinton,
but Talos,

2624
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:35,950
what are those transcripts,
but I think they have that work thought

2625
01:45:36,201 --> 01:45:37,400
out.
Well it's,

2626
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:40,610
it's tricky man.
When you have a lot of money like that,

2627
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:44,300
hundreds of thousands of dollars and
someone's paying you to talk for an

2628
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:45,920
hour,
that is absurd.

2629
01:45:45,950 --> 01:45:48,050
That's absurd.
It doesn't make any sense.

2630
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:51,980
And they have transcripts of it.
I guess it won't show up.

2631
01:45:51,981 --> 01:45:53,630
She won't,
she won't release them.

2632
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:56,030
The whole thing is very bizarre shit.
Right?

2633
01:45:56,031 --> 01:45:57,830
That's her normal thing.
She hides her email.

2634
01:45:57,831 --> 01:45:58,431
She was like,
oh,

2635
01:45:58,431 --> 01:46:01,310
I didn't know it wasn't allowed to use
regular emails for this stuff.

2636
01:46:01,490 --> 01:46:03,860
Oh,
you guys aren't allowed to fly that.

2637
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:05,630
Well,
here's one of the things that I'm,

2638
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:09,290
Mike Baker was talking to me about and
he's a former CIA operative,

2639
01:46:09,291 --> 01:46:12,590
has been on the show before.
He runs a security company now and he

2640
01:46:12,591 --> 01:46:14,000
said,
if that was me,

2641
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:15,800
which she did,
he goes,

2642
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:17,000
well,
I would be in jail.

2643
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:20,630
What if I did what she did?
Private emails using a private email

2644
01:46:20,631 --> 01:46:23,510
address and sending top secret
information through that email address.

2645
01:46:23,511 --> 01:46:24,740
He goes,
I'd be in jail.

2646
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:27,440
He's like,
she had an email server in her bathroom.

2647
01:46:28,010 --> 01:46:30,800
Not only that,
but the guy who set up that email server

2648
01:46:30,801 --> 01:46:33,350
just got immunity from federal
prosecution.

2649
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:35,240
Wow.
So she's already in this protected group

2650
01:46:35,241 --> 01:46:35,991
of people.
They were like,

2651
01:46:35,991 --> 01:46:38,570
we can pretty much do whatever he wants.
It's squirrels,

2652
01:46:38,571 --> 01:46:40,790
Ville,
man hole things.

2653
01:46:40,830 --> 01:46:44,900
Squirly like they're not even try.
She's in the middle running for

2654
01:46:44,901 --> 01:46:47,900
president.
She at the lead of the Democratic

2655
01:46:47,901 --> 01:46:50,220
nomination and she's involved in to
criminal

2656
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:52,800
investigations.
She says Christ.

2657
01:46:53,070 --> 01:46:53,791
Yeah.
And they're just like,

2658
01:46:53,791 --> 01:46:54,930
let's just not talk about that.
Well,

2659
01:46:54,931 --> 01:46:57,870
it's like this is all they have and when
this is all they have,

2660
01:46:57,871 --> 01:47:00,060
I mean there's no one else.
Who the fuck else is there?

2661
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:02,580
There's Bernie Sanders and Hillary
Clinton.

2662
01:47:02,581 --> 01:47:03,660
Period.
That's it.

2663
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:07,290
That's it on the democratic side.
We haven't heard a peep of anybody else

2664
01:47:07,291 --> 01:47:08,290
since.
All right.

2665
01:47:09,090 --> 01:47:10,560
Who else?
Everybody's gone.

2666
01:47:10,590 --> 01:47:12,780
They're all gone.
It's just them.

2667
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:16,500
So it's,
it's one of those things where

2668
01:47:16,501 --> 01:47:18,450
everybody's shutting the fuck up because
they think they have to.

2669
01:47:18,451 --> 01:47:21,750
This is the last gasps of a dying
system.

2670
01:47:22,110 --> 01:47:27,110
This is the last gasps of a ridiculous
dying system that is set up because it

2671
01:47:27,981 --> 01:47:30,330
was back.
The system is fighting back then was set

2672
01:47:30,331 --> 01:47:33,240
up back when people wrote with feathers,
slinger when we had congress,

2673
01:47:33,241 --> 01:47:37,500
because I couldn't afford to travel from
Nashville all the way up to Washington.

2674
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:42,360
So we have our congress goes for us,
they speak for us,

2675
01:47:42,470 --> 01:47:43,141
so we have to,
but man,

2676
01:47:43,141 --> 01:47:45,890
we have email and phones.
We don't need you to go there for and

2677
01:47:45,891 --> 01:47:48,180
why do you have a job?
It needs to be restructured.

2678
01:47:48,181 --> 01:47:50,070
Restructured.
Yeah.

2679
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:52,470
Well it needs to be restructured to that
from scratch.

2680
01:47:52,650 --> 01:47:56,700
The technology at the technology and the
access to people that's available today

2681
01:47:56,701 --> 01:48:01,560
because government should be,
people should have to have some level of

2682
01:48:01,561 --> 01:48:05,790
education to understand the parameters
of what they're talking about,

2683
01:48:05,791 --> 01:48:06,930
what they're voting on.
Yeah,

2684
01:48:07,110 --> 01:48:08,970
we don't,
we're not even getting the information

2685
01:48:09,010 --> 01:48:10,710
to it.
There's so much waste.

2686
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:15,240
We are government has got a virus and
it's not being cured.

2687
01:48:15,930 --> 01:48:17,370
I,
I talked to these guys who were defense

2688
01:48:17,371 --> 01:48:21,390
contracts work for defense contractors
in Iraq and Afghanistan and one of them

2689
01:48:21,391 --> 01:48:24,240
had been in the military before.
They both been with the military when

2690
01:48:24,241 --> 01:48:25,710
they didn't a pinch pinto cartridge.

2691
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:29,130
They don't order petro cartridges.
They order a new printer,

2692
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:32,370
take out the printer cartridge and shred
the new printer.

2693
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,473
What?
Yeah,

2694
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:36,150
and there's no repercussions for that
because no one has to be like,

2695
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:38,300
did they do that?
It's a,

2696
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:41,990
it's easier or to order it that way.
What I,

2697
01:48:42,010 --> 01:48:43,260
there's no reason for it,
man.

2698
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:46,430
It's all fucking wasteful.
The these guys high as fuck when they're

2699
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:47,191
telling you this.
No,

2700
01:48:47,191 --> 01:48:47,941
they weren't like,
dude,

2701
01:48:47,941 --> 01:48:51,540
he's going to go on a podcast to talk
about this too high to remember the

2702
01:48:51,541 --> 01:48:53,730
specific details,
but that's one of them and it's like,

2703
01:48:53,731 --> 01:48:56,130
dude,
we're just,

2704
01:48:56,131 --> 01:48:58,820
it's just as bureaucracy.
It's just corrupted and the governments

2705
01:48:58,821 --> 01:49:00,660
in and now it's like,
I dunno Obama,

2706
01:49:00,661 --> 01:49:02,640
he just won't talk about,
he's done some great shit,

2707
01:49:02,910 --> 01:49:06,360
but he just won't talk about the drone
strikes about wedding parties in Yemen

2708
01:49:06,361 --> 01:49:09,570
where we're not even at war with just
killing random people.

2709
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:11,820
And our official quote is like,
let's just not talk about it.

2710
01:49:11,821 --> 01:49:13,440
But gay marriage is legalized and
that's,

2711
01:49:13,441 --> 01:49:13,831
yeah,
man,

2712
01:49:13,831 --> 01:49:15,990
that's great.
You can't just murder people.

2713
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:18,780
More people have big died on a drone
strikes under him then Bush.

2714
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:19,830
Yeah,
way more.

2715
01:49:19,830 --> 01:49:21,720
Well,
there's more drones now.

2716
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:24,960
They're way better too.
There's still killing innocence and

2717
01:49:24,961 --> 01:49:27,090
we're just not talking about it.
Yeah,

2718
01:49:27,150 --> 01:49:29,190
I mean they can arrest people now.
Never tried them.

2719
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:31,770
Well they've also,
NSA has more power than they've ever

2720
01:49:31,771 --> 01:49:34,020
had,
cause Feinstein didn't just restructured

2721
01:49:34,021 --> 01:49:36,690
it.
They also used to shoot at metadata.

2722
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:39,430
I don't know if they still do that,
but they used to shoot like we're a

2723
01:49:39,431 --> 01:49:41,100
phone is.
Oh really?

2724
01:49:41,101 --> 01:49:43,500
So if you're a real bad guy and you're
hanging out in an apartment building and

2725
01:49:43,501 --> 01:49:45,700
your phone happens to be there,
that's what you're shooting at.

2726
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:48,280
Oh,
shooting missiles at that phone hoping

2727
01:49:48,281 --> 01:49:49,680
somebody else has the phone,
then it's like,

2728
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:52,390
it's acceptable casualties at the phone
in the bedroom.

2729
01:49:52,450 --> 01:49:53,680
Oh,
we took that bedroom out.

2730
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:54,810
What?
That was Americans,

2731
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:57,130
we wouldn't do that because we value
American lives.

2732
01:49:57,190 --> 01:49:58,690
Are innocent,
lives over innocent.

2733
01:49:59,170 --> 01:50:00,550
Um,
you get many lives.

2734
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:03,100
It will,
it's just way more convenient when they

2735
01:50:03,101 --> 01:50:05,710
don't look like us.
They don't talk like us and they dress

2736
01:50:05,711 --> 01:50:08,170
weird.
It's way more convenient to light them

2737
01:50:08,171 --> 01:50:09,210
up with rocket.
This is why,

2738
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:10,810
uh,
the British were smart when they

2739
01:50:10,811 --> 01:50:13,240
colonized Africa.
Um,

2740
01:50:13,270 --> 01:50:14,500
they put,
uh,

2741
01:50:14,530 --> 01:50:16,300
east Indian people,
Indians from,

2742
01:50:16,340 --> 01:50:18,190
from India.
They put them in charge.

2743
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:21,910
So the Africans hated the oppressors.
Hated people who,

2744
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:23,110
you know,
dominated him,

2745
01:50:23,170 --> 01:50:24,370
conquered them.
No one likes people.

2746
01:50:24,430 --> 01:50:26,120
No one likes being conquered.
It's just not a thing.

2747
01:50:26,170 --> 01:50:27,460
Went to a couple of girls that ran in
there,

2748
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:31,930
and so they're like their face of who
they hate it with these Indians who also

2749
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:33,250
had been conquered,
move over there.

2750
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:36,040
Right?
So there's really no terrorism on

2751
01:50:36,041 --> 01:50:41,041
British soil from the African Milton's
because they don't hate that white face.

2752
01:50:42,730 --> 01:50:47,680
Well if we went to war with say Russia
today,

2753
01:50:48,010 --> 01:50:50,950
they look just like just like us.
This is harder.

2754
01:50:50,990 --> 01:50:53,170
Yeah.
Luckily they were coats.

2755
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:56,680
Maybe we'd find out that the
government's photoshopping their faces

2756
01:50:56,681 --> 01:51:01,540
and stretching them out to make them
look more like look at those oval heads.

2757
01:51:01,810 --> 01:51:02,530
Yeah.
What does that,

2758
01:51:02,530 --> 01:51:05,230
um,
which rue salon pro pro pro pro

2759
01:51:05,290 --> 01:51:08,770
providing the cough is one of the top,
uh,

2760
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:12,970
boxers and I think he's won 54.
One 47 one,

2761
01:51:12,971 --> 01:51:13,804
four,
seven.

2762
01:51:14,020 --> 01:51:17,510
Come on providing a coffee.
He's an animal animal.

2763
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:18,101
Oh yeah.
He's,

2764
01:51:18,101 --> 01:51:21,230
they call him the Siberian,
something around in Siberian express it

2765
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:22,510
overhead.
Yeah.

2766
01:51:22,511 --> 01:51:23,620
His,
his is,

2767
01:51:23,730 --> 01:51:26,980
it might seen his first name wrong.
Yeah.

2768
01:51:27,490 --> 01:51:28,390
He,
um,

2769
01:51:28,630 --> 01:51:31,840
he takes unbelievable amounts of
punishment is what he looks like.

2770
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:33,380
But look at him.
See,

2771
01:51:33,730 --> 01:51:36,430
he looks just foreign enough.
You know what that is?

2772
01:51:36,431 --> 01:51:37,630
Yeah.
He's got some Asian in him.

2773
01:51:37,910 --> 01:51:38,830
Well,
he's got a Russia,

2774
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:42,130
I think he's got Mongolian in Mongolia.
It's probably why he's such a fucking

2775
01:51:42,131 --> 01:51:44,890
warrior.
He's probably descendant of Ganga Iskcon

2776
01:51:44,950 --> 01:51:46,120
or some shit.
Yeah.

2777
01:51:46,121 --> 01:51:47,500
He didn't look Russian.
Well,

2778
01:51:47,501 --> 01:51:48,580
the,
the um,

2779
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:52,330
the Mongols conquered Russia for like
200 years.

2780
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:53,740
Really?
Yeah.

2781
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:58,920
The Mongols came in in the winter in
Russia and unexpectedly and fucking took

2782
01:51:59,651 --> 01:52:00,760
over.
He looks like toby,

2783
01:52:00,761 --> 01:52:04,030
the front bar tender a little bit.
Yeah.

2784
01:52:04,420 --> 01:52:07,300
That's funny as fuck.
That guy's an animal man.

2785
01:52:07,390 --> 01:52:09,310
He's a fucking animal.
Ooh.

2786
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:10,360
Yeah.
He's fun to watch.

2787
01:52:10,361 --> 01:52:12,760
He's super aggressive.
So let's talk about this rematch.

2788
01:52:13,210 --> 01:52:15,640
Which one?
Nate Diaz and conor Mcgregor.

2789
01:52:15,670 --> 01:52:17,800
What are they fighting at 55?
I do not know.

2790
01:52:17,830 --> 01:52:20,950
I don't think that's been solidified.
I believe that connor is asked for it to

2791
01:52:20,951 --> 01:52:22,750
take place at 70,
which is where he was,

2792
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:26,410
but he can say like,
I can do this exactly the same way and

2793
01:52:26,411 --> 01:52:27,820
then it won't be a factor,
you know?

2794
01:52:27,821 --> 01:52:31,590
But also I think he was really healthy
at one 70 and I think you'd like it was

2795
01:52:31,710 --> 01:52:34,300
connor.
I can think you felt great leading up to

2796
01:52:34,301 --> 01:52:38,500
the camp and leading up to the fight.
He just had a bad game plan and his

2797
01:52:38,501 --> 01:52:42,540
ground Game Kinda got exposed to weight
classes above where you want to tie two

2798
01:52:42,550 --> 01:52:43,960
weight classes.
It's not true.

2799
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:46,370
First of all,
they both weighed in almost exactly

2800
01:52:46,370 --> 01:52:48,560
the same.
No two way classes above where he won

2801
01:52:48,561 --> 01:52:49,490
his title.
Yes.

2802
01:52:49,491 --> 01:52:52,310
But not really.
All it is is they're not cutting weight.

2803
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:54,020
It's too,
but he's not whiting.

2804
01:52:54,470 --> 01:52:57,170
Right.
But he's not fighting like Damien Maia

2805
01:52:57,320 --> 01:53:02,220
who used to fight at two oh five or one
85 and he's cutting down title shot and

2806
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:04,760
listen that title shots where it's like
you don't deserve title shot on two

2807
01:53:04,761 --> 01:53:06,830
weight classes above you.
It's just a nate diaz fight.

2808
01:53:06,980 --> 01:53:08,980
Well this isn't a title shot.
I'm saying at least.

2809
01:53:08,981 --> 01:53:09,711
It's like,
well,

2810
01:53:09,711 --> 01:53:13,730
you know the whole story behind it,
there was a fallout Hofeld dos Anjos is

2811
01:53:13,731 --> 01:53:15,980
the lightweight champion was supposed to
be fighting conor mcgregor.

2812
01:53:15,981 --> 01:53:18,140
He breaks his foot 11 days before the
fight.

2813
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:20,870
Nate Diaz takes the fight on a drop of a
hat.

2814
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:23,840
No training whatsoever.
I mean fucking none.

2815
01:53:23,970 --> 01:53:25,850
He hasn't done anything.
He was at the store.

2816
01:53:25,910 --> 01:53:26,810
Yeah,
he was hanging,

2817
01:53:26,811 --> 01:53:28,520
hanging out and uh,
nate,

2818
01:53:28,550 --> 01:53:30,320
you know,
posted pictures afterwards of him

2819
01:53:30,321 --> 01:53:33,530
drinking Tequila and hanging out in
Mexico eating tacos and shit.

2820
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:36,620
So he was just having a car,
nine bitch.

2821
01:53:36,650 --> 01:53:37,880
He's just living his life.
Right.

2822
01:53:37,881 --> 01:53:41,210
But he's in such good shape that he can
get away with that because he does so

2823
01:53:41,211 --> 01:53:44,510
much triathlon training.
He's constantly biking and swimming and

2824
01:53:44,511 --> 01:53:47,060
running.
He entered into a bunch of triathlons.

2825
01:53:47,061 --> 01:53:50,840
He's in very good shape and so he was
able to pull it off cause his cardio

2826
01:53:50,841 --> 01:53:55,130
base was so good and just,
he's a fucking damn good fighter.

2827
01:53:55,490 --> 01:53:58,550
He's a damn good fighter.
And he signed too and he's fought

2828
01:53:58,551 --> 01:54:01,160
legitimately at one 70 twice.
He lost,

2829
01:54:01,370 --> 01:54:02,840
he lost a stun gun,
Kim.

2830
01:54:02,841 --> 01:54:06,590
And he also lost a Roy McDonald at one
70 these are the legitimate one.

2831
01:54:06,591 --> 01:54:08,450
Seventies and Roy being one of the best
ones.

2832
01:54:08,530 --> 01:54:09,500
70 world.
Yeah,

2833
01:54:09,950 --> 01:54:13,640
he got ragdolled a little bit by rory,
but you know that was a wake up call for

2834
01:54:13,641 --> 01:54:16,880
him.
He went back to one 55 and at one 55 in

2835
01:54:16,881 --> 01:54:20,720
his last fight against Michael Johnson,
he put on probably the best performance

2836
01:54:20,721 --> 01:54:23,270
up to the conor mcgregor fight,
the best performance of his career.

2837
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:25,420
He was fucking sensations.
When I view Nate Diaz,

2838
01:54:25,421 --> 01:54:27,050
I view,
I think of him as a 50 fiver.

2839
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:29,120
He,
that's what he usually competes at.

2840
01:54:29,121 --> 01:54:31,130
But for this fight,
like he didn't want to have to cut

2841
01:54:31,131 --> 01:54:33,290
weight 2011 days out.
It's a little heavy.

2842
01:54:33,291 --> 01:54:33,801
So he says,
look,

2843
01:54:33,801 --> 01:54:36,110
let's make it at one 70 they both agree.
Nate Wade,

2844
01:54:36,111 --> 01:54:39,920
one 69 konner weighed one 68 or maybe
vice versa.

2845
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:42,710
I think that's it though.
So I mean they're basically the same

2846
01:54:42,711 --> 01:54:44,120
size.
What will they find out?

2847
01:54:44,710 --> 01:54:46,610
Well,
they fought at one 70 what do you mean

2848
01:54:47,290 --> 01:54:48,560
when nate said,
I'll fight it once every,

2849
01:54:48,561 --> 01:54:49,394
where was he walking up?

2850
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:52,670
Probably a little heavier than that.
He probably died it and worked out real

2851
01:54:52,671 --> 01:54:57,140
hard for seven or eight days of the 11
cockpit on the last couple.

2852
01:54:57,260 --> 01:54:58,670
No,
connor didn't have to cut anything.

2853
01:54:59,000 --> 01:54:59,900
I mean,
if he cut anything,

2854
01:54:59,901 --> 01:55:01,270
it probably a couple of pounds.
So,

2855
01:55:01,340 --> 01:55:02,800
which is not tied,
you just don't eat.

2856
01:55:03,940 --> 01:55:06,380
That happens.
But there's not even 10 pounds

2857
01:55:06,381 --> 01:55:07,640
different.
So the same way,

2858
01:55:07,730 --> 01:55:10,970
like when they got into the octagon,
I guarantee you they're within a pound

2859
01:55:10,971 --> 01:55:15,971
or two of each other.
But nate is longer and taller and he's a

2860
01:55:16,281 --> 01:55:19,790
very good boxer.
Like nate's bars on a regular basis with

2861
01:55:19,791 --> 01:55:22,850
Andre Ward,
who was one of the best pound for pound,

2862
01:55:22,851 --> 01:55:25,160
if not the best pound for pound box or
in the world.

2863
01:55:25,161 --> 01:55:27,530
Now that Floyd Mayweather,
quote unquote retired.

2864
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:32,480
Andre Ward is a motherfucker and he just
fought this Saturday night on hbo and I

2865
01:55:32,481 --> 01:55:33,470
just watched it the other day.

2866
01:55:33,860 --> 01:55:35,390
Um,
on Dvr.

2867
01:55:35,391 --> 01:55:37,220
It's fucking amazing.
He's so good,

2868
01:55:37,221 --> 01:55:38,330
dude.
He's such a,

2869
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:41,930
he's just nasty and he's now he's
fighting at one 75 he's going to fight a

2870
01:55:41,940 --> 01:55:44,500
survey.
Sergey who's like the best one,

2871
01:55:44,501 --> 01:55:47,940
75 are in the world.
So he fought nate spars with that guy

2872
01:55:47,941 --> 01:55:50,400
that day on a regular basis,
like their friends.

2873
01:55:50,610 --> 01:55:52,890
And you know nate also spars his brother
Nick,

2874
01:55:52,891 --> 01:55:54,330
cause one of the best strikers in the
UFC.

2875
01:55:54,331 --> 01:55:56,160
Definitely one of the best boxers.
You know,

2876
01:55:56,161 --> 01:55:58,170
he's a very good boxer.
And,

2877
01:55:58,410 --> 01:56:00,750
and he also spars with Joe Schilling all
the time.

2878
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:04,520
Who is a glory world champion kickboxing
world champion.

2879
01:56:04,530 --> 01:56:08,430
He's a motherfucker man.
So Neda sparring with like high level

2880
01:56:08,431 --> 01:56:11,010
world class striker like legitimate.
Andre Ward,

2881
01:56:11,011 --> 01:56:14,010
Joe Schilling,
two world champions and two respective

2882
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:15,780
disciplines.
So He's,

2883
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:18,540
he's a bad motherfucker.
I just think that people,

2884
01:56:18,541 --> 01:56:22,320
he seems swearing and stick it up his
double fingers and they don't realize

2885
01:56:22,570 --> 01:56:22,950
all that.

2886
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:26,820
Put all that shit aside and observe his
movements,

2887
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:32,010
observe his movements in a fight like in
the Michael Johnson fight in the,

2888
01:56:32,011 --> 01:56:33,960
uh,
the gummy fight in the markets.

2889
01:56:33,961 --> 01:56:37,770
Dave fight in the gray maynard fight.
Observe his movements.

2890
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:41,130
He's a motherfucker dude.
When he tees off on you,

2891
01:56:41,190 --> 01:56:46,190
he comes at you like a snake.
He's got long ass on connections of all

2892
01:56:47,221 --> 01:56:51,330
time where it's like 80% of us strucks
hit strikes in the first round.

2893
01:56:51,331 --> 01:56:52,680
He Lit Donald Up.
It was like,

2894
01:56:52,681 --> 01:56:54,390
what the fuck it,
nothing missed.

2895
01:56:54,660 --> 01:56:57,120
He let Donald Up.
He fucked on all up in that first round.

2896
01:56:57,340 --> 01:57:00,150
Donald Donald Donald started coming back
with leg kicks.

2897
01:57:00,570 --> 01:57:03,930
The only guy who's ever really
successfully like put him away in the

2898
01:57:03,931 --> 01:57:08,790
UFC was Josh Thompson and Josh Thompson
is one of the most underrated guys.

2899
01:57:09,210 --> 01:57:11,700
He's,
he's Josh Thompson when he was at his

2900
01:57:11,701 --> 01:57:15,990
best left to go over to strike force.
And a lot of people missed out on some

2901
01:57:15,991 --> 01:57:17,940
of the fucking wars that he had over
there.

2902
01:57:18,170 --> 01:57:20,550
And the Gilbert Melendez fights over
there and he went through,

2903
01:57:20,551 --> 01:57:21,990
you know,
a lot of wear and tear on you.

2904
01:57:22,110 --> 01:57:25,770
But like skill for skill.
Josh Thompson is a mother Fucker,

2905
01:57:25,771 --> 01:57:29,220
but he's now,
he's like 36 time just starts to get

2906
01:57:29,221 --> 01:57:31,020
everybody.
But at his best.

2907
01:57:31,021 --> 01:57:34,650
And I think that like his last fight
with Nate Diaz when he head kicked,

2908
01:57:34,651 --> 01:57:37,710
I mean stopped him.
It was one of like his best performances

2909
01:57:37,711 --> 01:57:39,990
ever.
And then you had some losses after that,

2910
01:57:39,991 --> 01:57:42,090
but it can't,
it's like it's hard to stay healthy and

2911
01:57:42,091 --> 01:57:43,830
get through a camp when you're 36 years
old.

2912
01:57:43,831 --> 01:57:47,070
When those guys get to the late thirties
things start to get.

2913
01:57:47,250 --> 01:57:50,310
So he has one loss.
But the loss in my opinion,

2914
01:57:50,311 --> 01:57:53,160
I mean one stoppage loss,
but the loss to Thompson's like,

2915
01:57:53,161 --> 01:57:54,990
well he's one of the most underrated
guys.

2916
01:57:55,020 --> 01:57:56,910
So it's like solid loss.
Fuck yeah,

2917
01:57:56,911 --> 01:57:59,160
it doesn't get,
doesn't get looked at as solid as it

2918
01:57:59,161 --> 01:57:59,640
should be.

2919
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:02,370
I think Thompson at its best is,
he's a motherfucker.

2920
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:03,151
So if,
okay,

2921
01:58:03,151 --> 01:58:06,210
so let's say he's a natural one 70,
or let's say he wants to fight the

2922
01:58:06,211 --> 01:58:07,530
conor,
but he's not,

2923
01:58:07,531 --> 01:58:09,780
he's not,
he just wants to fight this fight at one

2924
01:58:09,781 --> 01:58:12,840
70 and prove his point that he would
appoint to fight exactly the way they

2925
01:58:12,841 --> 01:58:15,570
did it before and to come in and fight
in a bar.

2926
01:58:15,700 --> 01:58:17,910
This is what happens if they're going to
do that in the meantime,

2927
01:58:17,911 --> 01:58:22,080
there's lit frankie than Aldo fight for
a title I long ago or vacate the belt

2928
01:58:22,081 --> 01:58:24,690
that you haven't defended once.
Max Holloway should be in the mix as

2929
01:58:24,691 --> 01:58:25,860
well.
You know,

2930
01:58:25,861 --> 01:58:30,570
I think they also offered,
although a shot at Mcgregor and he

2931
01:58:30,571 --> 01:58:33,060
didn't take it,
that could be a Brazilian thing,

2932
01:58:33,061 --> 01:58:36,200
if you know what I mean.
Who else?

2933
01:58:36,310 --> 01:58:38,390
Okay.
You made the injection like heroin,

2934
01:58:38,420 --> 01:58:39,630
they'll do that.
They still do that.

2935
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:44,740
Uh,
I would say it was more like he's just

2936
01:58:44,741 --> 01:58:47,920
an unprepared and out of shape and they
want to get knocked out again.

2937
01:58:47,950 --> 01:58:49,280
I mean,
the guy just knocked him out with want

2938
01:58:49,281 --> 01:58:51,970
to fucking punch a couple of months ago.
I remember it got,

2939
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:52,810
but I mean,
he's like,

2940
01:58:52,810 --> 01:58:54,150
give me that rematch because we can be
mentioned.

2941
01:58:54,190 --> 01:58:54,971
No,
see,

2942
01:58:54,971 --> 01:58:59,230
he didn't know that connor was going to
get worked when Connie got worked by

2943
01:58:59,231 --> 01:59:00,820
Nate Diaz.
It changed the whole game.

2944
01:59:00,850 --> 01:59:01,211
Is there.
Oh,

2945
01:59:01,211 --> 01:59:03,100
I can pick this guy.
Everything changed,

2946
01:59:03,101 --> 01:59:05,170
man.
Everything changed in everyone's

2947
01:59:05,171 --> 01:59:08,380
approach to him.
When you watch a guy get beat up and

2948
01:59:08,381 --> 01:59:10,000
strangled like that,
you gotta pee again.

2949
01:59:10,010 --> 01:59:10,660
Yeah,
go ahead.

2950
01:59:10,660 --> 01:59:11,121
Yeah,
go ahead.

2951
01:59:11,121 --> 01:59:12,970
Do it.
Talking about this.

2952
01:59:13,220 --> 01:59:16,810
Don't worry about it man.
But my point is for the folks listing,

2953
01:59:17,050 --> 01:59:21,250
when you watch a guy get beat up,
like conor got beat up against nate and

2954
01:59:21,310 --> 01:59:24,490
he shoots for a take down and then gets
taken down naked on top of them,

2955
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:27,670
beats him up and then chokes him a taps
real quick.

2956
01:59:27,670 --> 01:59:30,190
Like nate just dominated.
And once it got to the ground and he was

2957
01:59:30,191 --> 01:59:32,800
already hurt when it got to the ground,
then everybody goes,

2958
01:59:32,830 --> 01:59:34,030
hmm,
okay.

2959
01:59:34,690 --> 01:59:37,630
Could Hofeld dos Anjos do this?
Could.

2960
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:40,660
And for a guy like conor,
I think one of the reasons why he wants

2961
01:59:40,661 --> 01:59:43,510
his fight back is to prove that he
fucked up,

2962
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:46,960
that he tried to take nate out with big
power bombs.

2963
01:59:46,961 --> 01:59:49,000
He gassed out,
he got tired,

2964
01:59:49,210 --> 01:59:51,250
and then nate boxed him up in the second
round.

2965
01:59:51,550 --> 01:59:54,510
Nate start tagging him,
had him hurt and had them shoot for a

2966
01:59:54,520 --> 01:59:56,710
take down.
So a guy like conor,

2967
01:59:56,770 --> 01:59:59,410
you don't get to be that good.
You don't get to be that far.

2968
01:59:59,411 --> 02:00:02,440
You don't get to be that successful.
You don't get to knock out all though

2969
02:00:02,441 --> 02:00:05,230
with one punch and beat the fuck out of
[inaudible] in the first round,

2970
02:00:05,231 --> 02:00:09,010
like you called it and beat the shit out
of seaver and stop Chad Mendez when you

2971
02:00:09,011 --> 02:00:10,570
wanted to bet millions of dollars on it.

2972
02:00:10,570 --> 02:00:14,320
I mean,
he's a legit 100% motherfucker.

2973
02:00:14,530 --> 02:00:19,530
But the game does not care about
personalities.

2974
02:00:19,810 --> 02:00:22,780
The game does not care about confidence.
He actually doesn't,

2975
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:25,480
Huh?
To interaction of fists and face and

2976
02:00:25,481 --> 02:00:30,460
chokes and next and kicks and bodies.
It does not care about anything other

2977
02:00:30,461 --> 02:00:32,740
than what works.
So like when you see a loss,

2978
02:00:32,741 --> 02:00:35,590
like a Rhonda Rousey getting knocked the
fuck out by Holly Holm,

2979
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:38,470
it does not mean that Ronda rousey
sucks.

2980
02:00:38,471 --> 02:00:40,810
It does not mean that Holly Holm is the
greatest ever.

2981
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:43,690
It just means that the game doesn't give
a fuck who you are.

2982
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:46,780
It doesn't care.
You want to charge face first at a

2983
02:00:46,781 --> 02:00:49,630
counter striker and she clips you with
that first punch.

2984
02:00:49,940 --> 02:00:53,230
You're already at CEC or already at
check,

2985
02:00:53,260 --> 02:00:56,950
you got rocked like the first punch and
then you're getting beat up for four and

2986
02:00:56,951 --> 02:00:59,830
a half minutes after that and then the
second round comes around.

2987
02:00:59,831 --> 02:01:01,900
You don't even know where the fuck you
are.

2988
02:01:02,020 --> 02:01:02,950
Your ears are going.

2989
02:01:06,380 --> 02:01:09,550
You can't see your fucking eyes are
blurry.

2990
02:01:09,551 --> 02:01:13,160
Must be so terrifying.
That's what I love about UFC as opposed

2991
02:01:13,161 --> 02:01:15,220
to boxing.
Nobody goes 29 to no,

2992
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:18,050
no.
I mean if you go six in a row,

2993
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:20,310
that's like wow.
That's why John Jones,

2994
02:01:20,311 --> 02:01:21,700
it's so spooky.
Yeah.

2995
02:01:21,740 --> 02:01:23,540
Nobody's beating Jon Jones.
Jon Jones.

2996
02:01:23,570 --> 02:01:25,890
Jon Jones has one loss and it's a
disqualification.

2997
02:01:25,910 --> 02:01:29,870
It's Matt Hamill and,
and where he was caressing him on top of

2998
02:01:29,871 --> 02:01:30,770
them.
And it was a,

2999
02:01:30,771 --> 02:01:34,580
it's a dumb rule.
So like 12 to six elbows from on a clock

3000
02:01:34,581 --> 02:01:36,440
face.
If you drop an elbow down from 12 to

3001
02:01:36,441 --> 02:01:38,540
six,
the people that made the rules thought

3002
02:01:38,541 --> 02:01:40,070
that that's somehow another,
it was dangerous.

3003
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:42,150
It's no different than any other kind of
elbows.

3004
02:01:42,151 --> 02:01:43,370
It's just a rule.
Yeah,

3005
02:01:43,390 --> 02:01:45,650
it's stupid rule.
It's a rule that they put in place

3006
02:01:45,651 --> 02:01:47,270
because the people that were on the
commission,

3007
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:49,340
this is coming from big John McCarthy
himself.

3008
02:01:49,580 --> 02:01:51,830
The people that were on the commission
at the time,

3009
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:52,993
they,
um,

3010
02:01:53,210 --> 02:01:55,370
they thought that if you dropped a 12 to
six elbow,

3011
02:01:55,371 --> 02:01:58,700
like those espn karate shows go,
he can break bricks and shit.

3012
02:01:58,730 --> 02:02:01,310
You could kill somebody.
So they,

3013
02:02:01,311 --> 02:02:03,650
uh,
they made it illegal.

3014
02:02:03,740 --> 02:02:05,150
Meanwhile,
it's not even 12 to six.

3015
02:02:05,151 --> 02:02:07,760
It's like one to seven.
It's stupid.

3016
02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:09,890
It's stupid.
He really,

3017
02:02:09,891 --> 02:02:12,740
I can fight again.
It's really almost never 12 to six.

3018
02:02:12,770 --> 02:02:15,920
It's always a slight angle,
but either way it's fucking dumb.

3019
02:02:15,921 --> 02:02:17,480
It's a dumb rule.
It doesn't make any sense.

3020
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:19,940
Yeah.
Um,

3021
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:23,120
by the way,
we have nate Diaz calling indoors sports

3022
02:02:23,121 --> 02:02:25,780
podcasts.
Punchdrunk sports id really will picnic

3023
02:02:25,830 --> 02:02:26,490
this.
Oh,

3024
02:02:26,490 --> 02:02:28,160
Nate Diaz fake.
They always call.

3025
02:02:28,180 --> 02:02:29,060
I'm glad you had to fake.

3026
02:02:29,260 --> 02:02:30,850
How good are they?
The big ones.

3027
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:31,750
Yeah.
Amazing.

3028
02:02:31,810 --> 02:02:33,850
Really because of the accents are great
and they talked about it.

3029
02:02:33,851 --> 02:02:35,500
Two Oh nine somewhat.
They're always talking about they're

3030
02:02:35,501 --> 02:02:39,250
going pontoon boat shopping
man.

3031
02:02:39,290 --> 02:02:40,100
You come on,
come on.

3032
02:02:40,100 --> 02:02:42,310
I got to hear a man.
They're great.

3033
02:02:42,311 --> 02:02:42,921
It's Danish.
No,

3034
02:02:42,921 --> 02:02:44,470
Neil.
And they're so fucking good at it.

3035
02:02:44,860 --> 02:02:48,580
For a while they were dating Ronda
Rousey and GSP was all upset about it

3036
02:02:48,581 --> 02:02:50,170
because he wanted to date Ronda Rousey
and they,

3037
02:02:50,430 --> 02:02:52,630
they catfished him and buried him and
buried him on a,

3038
02:02:52,730 --> 02:02:53,750
uh,
on a,

3039
02:02:53,751 --> 02:02:57,790
a refrigerator box and the desert.
He got out and now gsps addicted to

3040
02:02:57,791 --> 02:03:01,130
kitty litter,
tick kitty litter and computer spray.

3041
02:03:02,310 --> 02:03:03,810
These addictions,
doctor,

3042
02:03:03,820 --> 02:03:07,180
the aliens all the time.
They told me I missed the two.

3043
02:03:07,181 --> 02:03:10,560
I'm two minutes my life.
That's hilarious.

3044
02:03:10,970 --> 02:03:13,400
Is that on youtube anywhere?
Uh,

3045
02:03:13,540 --> 02:03:15,820
no.
Not Youtube but punch drunk sports.com I

3046
02:03:15,821 --> 02:03:17,410
think we get clips.
A daily motion was,

3047
02:03:17,411 --> 02:03:19,300
I think they're all open daily motion,
Dave,

3048
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:20,240
any of that stuff?
Yeah,

3049
02:03:20,241 --> 02:03:21,580
we got a click that shit and put it on.

3050
02:03:22,050 --> 02:03:23,160
Yeah.
Why don't you have clips?

3051
02:03:23,340 --> 02:03:26,210
I just don't like,
yeah.

3052
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:29,760
I mean there's no,
I can't give you a good reason that this

3053
02:03:29,761 --> 02:03:32,520
is the reason why I think the rematches
is huge.

3054
02:03:32,530 --> 02:03:33,870
Okay.
This is why you have to do it.

3055
02:03:33,900 --> 02:03:34,860
Okay.
First of all,

3056
02:03:34,861 --> 02:03:37,110
because conor mcgregor up until that
fight,

3057
02:03:37,350 --> 02:03:41,400
is one of the most spectacular fighters
ever attached to this boy talking about

3058
02:03:41,401 --> 02:03:41,910
him.
Yeah.

3059
02:03:41,910 --> 02:03:45,030
Just the spectacle in that sense of
spectacular.

3060
02:03:45,031 --> 02:03:48,360
The guy gets on stage and screams at the
winds and the crowd goes nuts.

3061
02:03:48,390 --> 02:03:50,310
The Irish flags are more galvanized the
nation.

3062
02:03:50,311 --> 02:03:51,740
And I don't even know what galvanized
means.

3063
02:03:51,750 --> 02:03:54,510
It means like a coating when you get
nail so they don't rust.

3064
02:03:54,540 --> 02:03:55,480
Okay.
Um,

3065
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:57,990
he's spectacular.
Right.

3066
02:03:58,200 --> 02:04:00,120
And his results inside the ark got
other.

3067
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:02,490
Nate Diaz fight had been incredibly
dramatic.

3068
02:04:03,990 --> 02:04:06,220
Mid Second round,
I'll cut him with an uppercut and

3069
02:04:06,300 --> 02:04:07,260
knocking about,
and then it's like,

3070
02:04:07,261 --> 02:04:08,040
what?

3071
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:12,660
But when a guy like nate Diaz beat you
and beat you the way he beat you,

3072
02:04:13,410 --> 02:04:15,390
the bright thing to do is to have a
rematch.

3073
02:04:15,420 --> 02:04:18,390
And this why?
Because the rematch is where the big

3074
02:04:18,391 --> 02:04:21,720
money's at.
The brea match with Nate Diaz is God

3075
02:04:22,110 --> 02:04:24,930
damn scrooge.
Mcduck gigantic die.

3076
02:04:24,931 --> 02:04:28,180
Huge.
2 million plus paper view the eyes.

3077
02:04:28,181 --> 02:04:29,640
It's still on the table.
Like if it goes,

3078
02:04:29,700 --> 02:04:32,280
let's just say he goes to 45 then maybe
55 again,

3079
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:33,570
there's always going to be like,
well,

3080
02:04:33,571 --> 02:04:34,920
I mean they will beat you.
You know.

3081
02:04:34,921 --> 02:04:36,570
Exactly.
Not only that,

3082
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:39,240
but here's the problem.
What Frankie might beat him.

3083
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:41,790
Sure.
Holloway.

3084
02:04:41,820 --> 02:04:43,470
Max Holloway might beat him in a
rematch.

3085
02:04:43,860 --> 02:04:44,800
Who knows?
Yeah.

3086
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:48,660
Jose Aldo might beat him now.
Now the Josie especially Julie all know

3087
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:52,430
Josie Aldo.
Yeah.

3088
02:04:52,450 --> 02:04:55,050
It just comes and real healthy.
Know what I'm saying?

3089
02:04:55,710 --> 02:04:58,290
If he
chose a,

3090
02:04:58,300 --> 02:05:03,120
although he is a fucking nine year
undefeated all time,

3091
02:05:03,121 --> 02:05:05,400
great fighter who got clipped with one
big punch.

3092
02:05:05,490 --> 02:05:10,140
So what if Aldo fights like in a similar
way to how Meesha tate fought.

3093
02:05:10,141 --> 02:05:13,210
Holly Holm takes his time.
Where's that motherfucker out and like

3094
02:05:13,270 --> 02:05:16,380
round two or three and just stays in the
outside and leg kicks the shit out of

3095
02:05:16,381 --> 02:05:18,420
him.
If all though just chooses to have,

3096
02:05:18,421 --> 02:05:20,490
I mean all it was so mad.
He tried to take his head off with a

3097
02:05:20,491 --> 02:05:23,430
left hook and he got clipped.
He load it up and he got clipped.

3098
02:05:23,490 --> 02:05:26,200
But what if he doesn't do that?
What if he goes in there and play slow

3099
02:05:26,201 --> 02:05:27,630
on the outside?
Starts kicking his legs?

3100
02:05:27,780 --> 02:05:30,330
What if he initiates a clinch?
Cause let me tell you something about

3101
02:05:30,331 --> 02:05:34,530
all those Jujitsu.
It's fucking world class like you watch

3102
02:05:34,550 --> 02:05:38,580
or Aldo versus Mike Brown in the UFC a
or the WEC rather.

3103
02:05:38,581 --> 02:05:41,190
When he wanted a welterweight,
they'll featherweight title can't get

3104
02:05:41,191 --> 02:05:41,760
anything.
Right.

3105
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,050
When he won the featherweight title to
it,

3106
02:05:43,051 --> 02:05:45,840
he takes his back like a fucking world
champion.

3107
02:05:45,841 --> 02:05:48,330
It's smashes him.
I mean this is what Anderson did when he

3108
02:05:48,331 --> 02:05:51,830
was at his best was he would get booze
and the first and second round and he's

3109
02:05:51,831 --> 02:05:53,980
just almost like this says,
what'd you to fucking relax?

3110
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,190
I'm about to knock this guy out.
Different style though.

3111
02:05:56,310 --> 02:05:58,140
But I mean it was like,
I'm not going to push.

3112
02:05:58,170 --> 02:06:01,770
I will wait and I will get you when it's
time to help continue to win.

3113
02:06:02,220 --> 02:06:04,470
Well,
Anderson has a very unique style.

3114
02:06:04,710 --> 02:06:07,860
His style is,
he's got a lot of Moyie Thai,

3115
02:06:08,070 --> 02:06:11,280
but he also has a lot of traditional
martial arts as well.

3116
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:14,940
Like some of the things that he does,
like the front kick to the face,

3117
02:06:14,941 --> 02:06:18,840
the way he does a front snap kick.
It wasn't like a Meu type push kick or a

3118
02:06:18,841 --> 02:06:19,650
team.

3119
02:06:19,650 --> 02:06:21,910
It was like a karate style kick was on
acid for that fight.

3120
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:27,460
Dude at the MGM and I sit next to each
other on acid screaming when he kicked

3121
02:06:27,931 --> 02:06:29,400
him in the face.
Like that dude,

3122
02:06:29,940 --> 02:06:32,400
that was a spectacular,
there was the first time we'd ever seen

3123
02:06:32,580 --> 02:06:35,010
a front kick to the face.
Kao in the UFC.

3124
02:06:35,690 --> 02:06:36,470
Yeah.
Yeah,

3125
02:06:36,470 --> 02:06:37,980
that'd be tour.
Stunning.

3126
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:42,750
So Anderson was a sniper and what he
would do is he would find your range,

3127
02:06:42,751 --> 02:06:45,520
find your timing,
and then he would unload on shows.

3128
02:06:45,540 --> 02:06:46,530
I can go a little close.
Yeah,

3129
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:47,161
close look.
Okay,

3130
02:06:47,161 --> 02:06:50,250
now I'm in my ranch or you know,
with different fighters who fought,

3131
02:06:50,430 --> 02:06:52,170
fought a different style like with rich
Franklin.

3132
02:06:52,171 --> 02:06:55,260
He overwhelmed were in the clinch like
rich Franklin didn't have an answer to

3133
02:06:55,261 --> 02:06:58,500
is what's called a plum.
That's when a guy grabs the back of your

3134
02:06:58,501 --> 02:07:00,750
head like this and pinches down with his
forearms.

3135
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:02,670
And uh,
the MEU Thai clinch.

3136
02:07:02,700 --> 02:07:05,640
Like when like anything else,
there's levels to it.

3137
02:07:05,790 --> 02:07:07,710
And it's one of those things where,
you know how,

3138
02:07:07,770 --> 02:07:08,990
this is a good way to describe it.
You know,

3139
02:07:09,010 --> 02:07:11,640
you tie your shoes and you tie your
shoes effortlessly,

3140
02:07:11,700 --> 02:07:13,830
just reached down and cause you've done
it your whole life.

3141
02:07:14,490 --> 02:07:18,720
You are pathway like the neuromuscular
pathway to tying your shoes is

3142
02:07:18,721 --> 02:07:21,540
automatic.
There's certain movements that become

3143
02:07:21,541 --> 02:07:22,770
like that.
Like when you're,

3144
02:07:22,840 --> 02:07:24,840
you're sparring or you're fighting in
particular,

3145
02:07:25,020 --> 02:07:28,140
sometimes you'll move out of the way and
you're throwing a counter before you

3146
02:07:28,141 --> 02:07:31,500
even realize you're doing it.
Like it's too fast for you to even think

3147
02:07:31,501 --> 02:07:32,420
about.
But you've,

3148
02:07:32,710 --> 02:07:37,710
you've carved that path so deeply in
your neuro muscular structure that when

3149
02:07:38,441 --> 02:07:40,660
someone does this,
you do that.

3150
02:07:40,810 --> 02:07:42,430
When you see this,
you counter there,

3151
02:07:42,431 --> 02:07:44,320
you understand,
you recognize openings without even

3152
02:07:44,321 --> 02:07:45,250
being conscious of it.

3153
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:50,140
And when,
when a guy gets in those grooves,

3154
02:07:50,260 --> 02:07:52,950
when you get in those groups,
it's very hard to,

3155
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:54,580
to deal with it if you don't have that
groove.

3156
02:07:55,120 --> 02:07:57,970
And Anderson had that groove when it
came to that Moy Thai clinch.

3157
02:07:57,971 --> 02:08:00,460
She could see it the way he was holding
onto him,

3158
02:08:00,650 --> 02:08:05,650
pushing those fights and Chai or yeah,
that's Thai kickboxing fights and it's

3159
02:08:05,831 --> 02:08:07,240
one of the things out there punching a
kicking,

3160
02:08:07,241 --> 02:08:09,820
but they did that throw,
it almost doesn't seem like it that much

3161
02:08:09,821 --> 02:08:10,930
damage.
Oh it does.

3162
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:13,550
It's what's humiliating.
And he was more like the,

3163
02:08:13,660 --> 02:08:15,210
the wind knocked out of you.
You know,

3164
02:08:15,330 --> 02:08:18,760
if the guy kicks your legs out from
under you and slams you on your back,

3165
02:08:18,761 --> 02:08:20,500
you're getting the wind knocked out of,
you can get your,

3166
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:22,990
you're injured,
you could get your shoulder's injured,

3167
02:08:22,991 --> 02:08:25,780
you can get your ribs injured,
your neck can get injured if you follow

3168
02:08:25,781 --> 02:08:28,090
the wrong way or you get knocked on the
way down.

3169
02:08:28,240 --> 02:08:30,430
And in some organizations you can kick
them in the face.

3170
02:08:30,431 --> 02:08:31,820
On the way down to,
well,

3171
02:08:31,850 --> 02:08:35,080
they'll flow.
So they'll throw kicks and then as you

3172
02:08:35,081 --> 02:08:36,730
are scrubbed before the referee gets to
you,

3173
02:08:36,731 --> 02:08:39,580
they'll fucking knew you in the face as
you're going down,

3174
02:08:39,610 --> 02:08:41,260
even with your gloves touching the
ground,

3175
02:08:41,261 --> 02:08:44,590
it's like legal and a lot of
organizations to knee or even kick you

3176
02:08:44,591 --> 02:08:45,880
in the face.
Wow.

3177
02:08:45,970 --> 02:08:48,140
So you got to read the funding herself.
I just thought I'll just follow the way

3178
02:08:48,141 --> 02:08:53,141
that we're going to brace myself.
[inaudible] has some crazy approaches.

3179
02:08:53,410 --> 02:08:55,270
Fun though.
They're clench.

3180
02:08:55,271 --> 02:08:59,620
Work is like one of the most
underappreciated aspects of the sport

3181
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:02,110
because everybody thinks of it as a
striking sport is,

3182
02:09:02,230 --> 02:09:06,730
but it's also grappling sport because
when they tie up inside that clinch,

3183
02:09:06,731 --> 02:09:08,840
the guys who are really good,
they,

3184
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:13,780
they execute these nasty trips and they
also the way of manipulating you into

3185
02:09:13,781 --> 02:09:18,160
knees and like when someone has a cold,
they clamped down and they know how to

3186
02:09:18,161 --> 02:09:19,210
control your neck.

3187
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:23,110
It's a very confusing feeling if you're
not accustomed to it from a high level

3188
02:09:23,111 --> 02:09:25,540
practitioner because you get locked and
you don't know what to do.

3189
02:09:25,660 --> 02:09:28,390
You start grabbing at it and you're
getting need and the body and then you

3190
02:09:28,391 --> 02:09:30,670
get kneed in the chin.
And you said that's one of the most

3191
02:09:30,671 --> 02:09:34,330
brutal things whenever the whole crowd
gets behind it too,

3192
02:09:34,331 --> 02:09:37,210
and they can start growing news news as
soon as that clinched comes in and they

3193
02:09:37,211 --> 02:09:39,820
all want to see it.
Well Anderson kneed him in the face.

3194
02:09:39,910 --> 02:09:42,780
He's destroyed,
were tranquil ins knows retracted,

3195
02:09:42,810 --> 02:09:44,920
had to get his nose completely
reconstructed.

3196
02:09:45,100 --> 02:09:47,530
I mean it was,
it was devastated after that.

3197
02:09:47,531 --> 02:09:48,790
Hers.
Oh Man,

3198
02:09:48,791 --> 02:09:52,300
those were the wwe pull up rich
Franklin,

3199
02:09:52,620 --> 02:09:55,490
um,
Anderson Silva versus rich Franklin once

3200
02:09:55,491 --> 02:09:59,410
he,
if you could find that anywhere that the

3201
02:09:59,410 --> 02:10:00,820
Kao Anderson Silva Kaos Rich Franklin
the first fight because it was a

3202
02:10:00,990 --> 02:10:02,830
masterclass.
No,

3203
02:10:02,831 --> 02:10:03,550
I don't think so.

3204
02:10:03,550 --> 02:10:04,570
No,
I don't think so.

3205
02:10:05,260 --> 02:10:07,150
I don't think so.
I was at his very first fight in the

3206
02:10:07,151 --> 02:10:08,470
UFC.
You might've been,

3207
02:10:08,590 --> 02:10:09,460
it might've been.
Yeah,

3208
02:10:09,461 --> 02:10:11,690
pull it back though.
So it was definitely the actual match.

3209
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:16,570
They'll pull it back so you can see the
actual of the niece of the face before

3210
02:10:16,571 --> 02:10:17,740
he is,
get him in the clinch.

3211
02:10:17,741 --> 02:10:19,180
And there's like scared.
Yeah,

3212
02:10:19,181 --> 02:10:21,850
well he starts doing this.
He starts moving them around and

3213
02:10:21,851 --> 02:10:23,330
manipulating,
seeing,

3214
02:10:23,350 --> 02:10:25,840
so Richard's trying to punch him,
but look how he manipulates him with

3215
02:10:25,841 --> 02:10:27,640
these fucking knees.
And the clinch just,

3216
02:10:27,790 --> 02:10:30,520
he never lets that clinch go.
Boom,

3217
02:10:30,521 --> 02:10:33,890
look at this.
He just holding onto the back his neck.

3218
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:38,030
See I was doing with his left hand and
he's needing his body and then he grabs

3219
02:10:38,031 --> 02:10:39,290
a hold of it with two hands.
Look at this.

3220
02:10:39,291 --> 02:10:40,700
Boom.
Look at that.

3221
02:10:40,701 --> 02:10:44,420
Boom to the body so we can toss them
around to the body and he's sliding

3222
02:10:44,421 --> 02:10:44,840
around.

3223
02:10:44,840 --> 02:10:47,330
And when rich goes to punches,
outmaneuvering him,

3224
02:10:47,480 --> 02:10:50,990
he's getting his shoulders in play.
So his shoulders are blocking these wide

3225
02:10:50,991 --> 02:10:54,110
looping punches.
And then he's just leaning his hips back

3226
02:10:54,380 --> 02:10:57,590
and forcing them to like to absorb these
knees to the body.

3227
02:10:57,591 --> 02:10:59,870
And each one of them is Wiki a more and
more and more.

3228
02:11:00,050 --> 02:11:01,070
And Boom,
look at these.

3229
02:11:01,430 --> 02:11:04,520
Boom again and that balance to the chin.
Boom,

3230
02:11:04,521 --> 02:11:05,061
boom,
boom,

3231
02:11:05,061 --> 02:11:06,770
and there's a combination.
He grabs him again,

3232
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:08,360
boom.
And to the chin,

3233
02:11:08,390 --> 02:11:11,750
boom to the legs,
boom to the body and the ways moving

3234
02:11:11,751 --> 02:11:16,100
them in a manipulating a man.
This is some high level shit and you

3235
02:11:16,130 --> 02:11:21,080
just didn't at the time see this level
of more tie in a,

3236
02:11:21,090 --> 02:11:24,710
in mma it was very rare to see,
at least from this position,

3237
02:11:24,711 --> 02:11:29,480
is a very rare position to see prolonged
in an MMA fight up into this point.

3238
02:11:29,820 --> 02:11:32,030
So there is,
nose is just shattered and now Anderson

3239
02:11:32,031 --> 02:11:33,920
just moving in for the kill and he gets
it again.

3240
02:11:33,950 --> 02:11:35,960
Boom.
It hits him in the temple and that's it.

3241
02:11:35,961 --> 02:11:37,700
It's over.
That's it.

3242
02:11:37,970 --> 02:11:40,310
And his nose was destroyed.
I mean destroyed.

3243
02:11:40,311 --> 02:11:43,340
It was like on the other side of it.
So you can see right there.

3244
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:44,030
You could see,
yeah,

3245
02:11:44,030 --> 02:11:46,360
that's when he took the title.
But back it up just a little bit Jamie.

3246
02:11:46,750 --> 02:11:48,820
You can see the nose,
you can see it.

3247
02:11:48,830 --> 02:11:49,280
What?
No,

3248
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:51,080
a little bit more like right there.
Let it go right there.

3249
02:11:51,550 --> 02:11:55,610
Why Watch when he look at his nose,
it's cave at the top.

3250
02:11:55,611 --> 02:11:57,530
There's no bridge.
The bridge,

3251
02:11:57,590 --> 02:11:59,330
no,
it's completely smashed.

3252
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:02,750
Ah,
as knows was never the same again.

3253
02:12:02,751 --> 02:12:06,980
He had to get a nasal reconstruction
surgery and it was a big deal and they,

3254
02:12:07,420 --> 02:12:07,971
they,
you have to,

3255
02:12:07,971 --> 02:12:11,060
you know,
put splints on your fucking back up.

3256
02:12:11,090 --> 02:12:14,300
They came back or fought him again.
Fought Anderson again,

3257
02:12:14,360 --> 02:12:16,590
got beat up again.
Just [inaudible].

3258
02:12:16,610 --> 02:12:19,100
He did his best.
He fought well and he fought,

3259
02:12:19,550 --> 02:12:21,680
fought great fighters.
I mean rich Franklin had some great

3260
02:12:21,681 --> 02:12:24,680
wars.
Vandelay Silva in the UFC knocked out

3261
02:12:24,681 --> 02:12:26,600
chocolate down as low as five.
Oh,

3262
02:12:26,601 --> 02:12:28,610
chuck was later.
Chuck was his last fight.

3263
02:12:28,670 --> 02:12:30,470
The last fight in the UFC.
They have a broken arm.

3264
02:12:30,471 --> 02:12:31,380
He knocked out chuck.
Yup.

3265
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:34,310
Or fuck it.
I got one shot go for chuck broke his

3266
02:12:34,311 --> 02:12:36,440
left arm with the kick.
Chuck kick.

3267
02:12:36,441 --> 02:12:37,700
Fucking aw,
hard.

3268
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:39,440
That's some good fights in that.
Oh my God.

3269
02:12:39,590 --> 02:12:44,570
But that was like the first time we'd
seen that level of that clinch in a

3270
02:12:44,571 --> 02:12:47,270
world championship level fight.
You never seen anybody control someone

3271
02:12:47,390 --> 02:12:49,330
for that long with a Thai clinch.
It was like Wah.

3272
02:12:49,610 --> 02:12:52,250
So Anderson was like responsible for a
lot of innovation.

3273
02:12:52,280 --> 02:12:55,970
A lot of firsts and not necessarily
innovation in that he's using like

3274
02:12:55,971 --> 02:12:59,690
pretty standard traditional techniques
for that respective art form.

3275
02:12:59,691 --> 02:13:01,970
Like a front kick is the most standard
technique ever.

3276
02:13:02,090 --> 02:13:05,540
But oddly enough,
there was no front kick Kaos until he

3277
02:13:05,541 --> 02:13:07,880
knocked out vitor Belfort.
It's amazing when you see that and then

3278
02:13:07,881 --> 02:13:10,250
it opens up.
Skateboarding has that too where it's

3279
02:13:10,251 --> 02:13:11,570
like someone will do it.
Everybody goes,

3280
02:13:11,660 --> 02:13:12,950
oh,
let's all do that.

3281
02:13:13,130 --> 02:13:15,230
Yeah.
When Leonardo knocked out,

3282
02:13:15,290 --> 02:13:17,540
uh,
randy coture with a jumping front kick

3283
02:13:17,541 --> 02:13:19,130
to the face,
everybody was like,

3284
02:13:19,190 --> 02:13:22,850
oh,
in Toronto and from like 60,000 people.

3285
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:25,280
That's a big one.
Yeah.

3286
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:28,280
When are they going to do the garden?
I don't know where they can do it now.

3287
02:13:28,310 --> 02:13:33,310
It's just recently got past,
but just to finish up this Frankie Edgar

3288
02:13:33,421 --> 02:13:36,260
thing,
Frankie Edgar could beat him if,

3289
02:13:36,440 --> 02:13:40,140
if he can get taken down and dominant
like that with nate.

3290
02:13:40,400 --> 02:13:42,510
Frankie's a goddamn tornado.
Frankie.

3291
02:13:42,520 --> 02:13:43,353
I agree.
I do too.

3292
02:13:43,370 --> 02:13:44,830
For getting left out there.
Like there's a,

3293
02:13:44,860 --> 02:13:47,070
there's a title eliminator fight and now
it's been like,

3294
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:49,470
I guess not a year,
but like,

3295
02:13:49,740 --> 02:13:51,940
well where this title shot?
He did what he had to say.

3296
02:13:51,990 --> 02:13:54,990
You said when this and you got a title
shot financially though,

3297
02:13:54,991 --> 02:13:56,880
you got it.
You got to understand their point of

3298
02:13:56,881 --> 02:13:57,240
view.
Okay.

3299
02:13:57,240 --> 02:13:59,520
But in the meantime,
although edgar interim title,

3300
02:13:59,540 --> 02:14:01,050
yeah.
Or Max Holloway.

3301
02:14:01,380 --> 02:14:05,870
Max Holloway's in the mix as well.
I can sue the jump.

3302
02:14:05,890 --> 02:14:07,150
Edgar.
It could wah,

3303
02:14:07,190 --> 02:14:10,290
it would be either hot ball.
You know what I say?

3304
02:14:10,291 --> 02:14:12,390
You got to get all doorframe actually
you've got to give all the pretty much

3305
02:14:12,391 --> 02:14:13,820
nine straight years,
no losses.

3306
02:14:13,850 --> 02:14:15,390
You got to let them fight again.
Right.

3307
02:14:15,570 --> 02:14:17,280
Of course.
That's not a rematch.

3308
02:14:17,780 --> 02:14:21,300
Nofziger I'm saying like title who is
either against a connor or whoever.

3309
02:14:21,330 --> 02:14:21,881
Okay.
Yeah,

3310
02:14:21,881 --> 02:14:23,370
I agree.
Like he's a number one contender.

3311
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:28,230
That's a good call.
Or You could set up a fight.

3312
02:14:28,290 --> 02:14:31,920
We're frankie fights Max Holloway or the
other eliminator.

3313
02:14:32,100 --> 02:14:34,320
Yeah.
The problem with Dafydd is then you get

3314
02:14:34,321 --> 02:14:36,600
rid of like one of the contenders.
Yeah.

3315
02:14:36,720 --> 02:14:38,510
If,
if it actually comes to pass,

3316
02:14:38,511 --> 02:14:41,940
I feel like he's already done that title
eliminator thing he wanted,

3317
02:14:42,030 --> 02:14:45,960
he did what he's asked to that half Max
Holloway fight the winner of Aldo.

3318
02:14:46,290 --> 02:14:47,550
Um,
Frankie,

3319
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:51,390
the real problem is a financial problem
because the money with Nate Diaz is

3320
02:14:51,391 --> 02:14:54,800
going to be so God damn gigantic.
But in the meantime also had that fight.

3321
02:14:54,900 --> 02:14:56,360
But the problem is one of those guys
keep,

3322
02:14:56,440 --> 02:14:58,630
get lost and get beat up.
It's,

3323
02:14:58,670 --> 02:14:59,503
it's true.
It's,

3324
02:14:59,580 --> 02:15:02,070
did you have three pieces in play at one
45?

3325
02:15:02,100 --> 02:15:05,670
I agree with you,
but I'm saying like the real,

3326
02:15:05,671 --> 02:15:10,320
the smart move really is you tell connor
he has to pick a weight class and if you

3327
02:15:10,321 --> 02:15:13,680
want to fight at one 70,
you got to give up your 145 pound title

3328
02:15:13,681 --> 02:15:16,230
and they fight for the real title,
not for the interim title.

3329
02:15:16,570 --> 02:15:17,700
That's,
that's the real thing.

3330
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:19,950
Like just give up your title,
give it up.

3331
02:15:19,980 --> 02:15:22,260
John Jones had to give up his title
because illegal problems,

3332
02:15:22,261 --> 02:15:23,080
right?
Yeah.

3333
02:15:23,080 --> 02:15:25,150
So something,
I had to give it up because uh,

3334
02:15:25,420 --> 02:15:27,840
er Aldo had to give it up because he
couldn't fight for awhile.

3335
02:15:28,380 --> 02:15:29,161
What?
Well,

3336
02:15:29,161 --> 02:15:30,390
no,
he never did get it and give up a

3337
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:30,870
steady,
they,

3338
02:15:30,870 --> 02:15:32,580
in terms of being trump,
fuck the interim.

3339
02:15:32,670 --> 02:15:34,230
Just give up your title.
You know,

3340
02:15:34,231 --> 02:15:35,550
it doesn't matter.
It's not a loss.

3341
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:38,160
The loss to nate Diaz,
you want to go to one 70 that means you

3342
02:15:38,161 --> 02:15:40,350
campaigning there.
You can't just freeze up the division.

3343
02:15:40,380 --> 02:15:44,550
So then you have Aldo versus frankie for
the real fucking title.

3344
02:15:44,551 --> 02:15:45,960
And they fought already before,
by the way.

3345
02:15:45,990 --> 02:15:48,840
Although frankly,
yes and although beat Frankie and was

3346
02:15:48,841 --> 02:15:52,410
doing Aldo in his prime,
but I think that Frankie is better right

3347
02:15:52,411 --> 02:15:54,000
now than he was then.

3348
02:15:54,330 --> 02:15:57,180
And I think that he's got some key wins.
Fights.

3349
02:15:57,181 --> 02:15:59,580
He's not supposed to win.
That's all he keeps doing and doing it

3350
02:15:59,581 --> 02:16:00,780
do.
It just keeps winning fights.

3351
02:16:00,781 --> 02:16:01,690
He's not supposed to win.
Well,

3352
02:16:01,710 --> 02:16:03,190
he wins fights.
He's supposed to win too.

3353
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:04,411
Oh yeah,
you're right.

3354
02:16:04,411 --> 02:16:06,880
Faber fight.
I mean Frankie still start,

3355
02:16:06,881 --> 02:16:10,050
he makes his name on these fucking Bj
fights and at these all these fights,

3356
02:16:10,051 --> 02:16:10,651
it just like,
Nah,

3357
02:16:10,651 --> 02:16:12,270
I didn't have a chance.
And they just keep doing it.

3358
02:16:13,200 --> 02:16:17,560
The Cub Swanson fight was a overwhelming
fight and then the Chad Mendez knock

3359
02:16:17,561 --> 02:16:19,050
out,
he knocked out Chad Mendez with one

3360
02:16:19,051 --> 02:16:20,970
punch.
He's at the top of the heap in my

3361
02:16:20,971 --> 02:16:23,720
opinion.
So I think that a rematch was not,

3362
02:16:23,730 --> 02:16:28,380
it's not a bad idea between frankie and
Aldo for the title and you have that on

3363
02:16:28,381 --> 02:16:33,030
an undercard of a UFC 200 or whatever
the fuck you've been hotter,

3364
02:16:33,120 --> 02:16:35,740
want someday to come back to 45 and it's
like sure man will give you a title

3365
02:16:35,741 --> 02:16:36,574
fight right away.

3366
02:16:36,640 --> 02:16:38,110
It's not like connor is not going to
know that.

3367
02:16:38,111 --> 02:16:40,120
He already beat Aldo and knocked him out
with one punch.

3368
02:16:40,330 --> 02:16:42,880
He could talk all kinds of mad shit for
the rematch.

3369
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:45,100
They could do it,
run it all back again.

3370
02:16:45,130 --> 02:16:47,530
If all though can get past frankie.
Yeah.

3371
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:50,080
So it's just a lot of fun stuff that can
happen.

3372
02:16:50,380 --> 02:16:54,220
But the nate diaz fight has to take
place because here's my point was this

3373
02:16:54,221 --> 02:16:57,040
is my final point,
is that if he beats nate diaz,

3374
02:16:57,070 --> 02:17:00,430
he silences everybody.
If he goes out there and he fights smart

3375
02:17:00,490 --> 02:17:03,190
and he sniped him and he stays the fuck
away from the boxing,

3376
02:17:03,340 --> 02:17:06,370
he uses a lot of leg kicks.
The Way dos Anjos did takes the front,

3377
02:17:06,520 --> 02:17:08,830
cause nate stands real heavy on the
front leg.

3378
02:17:08,831 --> 02:17:12,250
His front leg will be his right leg and
connor is a southpaw.

3379
02:17:12,310 --> 02:17:15,430
So set connor will be throwing a hard
left leg kick from the back leg.

3380
02:17:15,610 --> 02:17:17,410
It's a good setup for him in that
regard.

3381
02:17:17,710 --> 02:17:20,650
And then I'll also,
connor knows now he can't knock me out

3382
02:17:20,651 --> 02:17:22,050
with one punch.
So when we go,

3383
02:17:22,070 --> 02:17:24,070
so he's not going to load up and try to
uncork.

3384
02:17:24,220 --> 02:17:27,010
He's going to try to fight smart.
So in fighting smart,

3385
02:17:27,250 --> 02:17:31,450
then he'll be able to incorporate leg
kicks and he'll be able to incorporate,

3386
02:17:31,480 --> 02:17:33,280
uh,
he'll also understand he's got to

3387
02:17:33,281 --> 02:17:34,640
fucking stay off the ground.
You,

3388
02:17:34,641 --> 02:17:35,100
you,
you're,

3389
02:17:35,100 --> 02:17:36,460
you're not going to do well on the
ground one.

3390
02:17:36,461 --> 02:17:37,510
Nate Diaz,
he's just,

3391
02:17:37,780 --> 02:17:39,550
he's at a very,
very high level on the ground.

3392
02:17:39,551 --> 02:17:42,520
So unless connor gets way better with
his Jujitsu,

3393
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:44,290
yeah.
By the time that fight takes place,

3394
02:17:44,490 --> 02:17:47,080
it's just keep the fight standing up.
Use a lot of leg kicks,

3395
02:17:47,110 --> 02:17:49,150
you any beats them.
And if you beat some,

3396
02:17:49,480 --> 02:17:50,860
if he beats him,
if he beats nate,

3397
02:17:50,861 --> 02:17:52,490
Diaz loses.

3398
02:17:52,910 --> 02:17:54,220
Yeah.
So if he loses,

3399
02:17:54,250 --> 02:17:56,020
he was gonna lose.
He might've lost a frankie.

3400
02:17:56,021 --> 02:17:57,780
I'm going to say he's going to,
but he could have lost all,

3401
02:17:57,781 --> 02:17:59,230
do a rematch,
anything could have happened.

3402
02:17:59,240 --> 02:18:02,590
And then that Nate Diaz money's gone.
See the Nate Diaz,

3403
02:18:02,591 --> 02:18:05,290
money's the big money.
He is the most famous guy along with

3404
02:18:05,291 --> 02:18:06,430
connor right now.
If he wins,

3405
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:11,320
they're doing a 100% and they're all,
and then they give up that fucking title

3406
02:18:11,321 --> 02:18:14,980
at one 45 and get fucking rich.
I mean,

3407
02:18:14,981 --> 02:18:16,090
at some level,
if you're,

3408
02:18:16,180 --> 02:18:16,690
if you're,
uh,

3409
02:18:16,690 --> 02:18:20,810
if you're a martial artist and emphasize
the artists,

3410
02:18:21,410 --> 02:18:23,250
give,
keep your fucking titles the way Chris

3411
02:18:23,251 --> 02:18:24,780
serone seems to think about it.
Well,

3412
02:18:24,910 --> 02:18:26,020
I'm just here to fight,
man.

3413
02:18:26,021 --> 02:18:29,110
You play whatever belt you want on me.
He certainly want that title.

3414
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:31,230
So
yeah,

3415
02:18:31,300 --> 02:18:32,770
I feel what you're saying.
Yeah.

3416
02:18:32,850 --> 02:18:34,930
Um,
I think it's about money.

3417
02:18:34,931 --> 02:18:36,160
Weights,
you know,

3418
02:18:36,161 --> 02:18:38,950
I'm money fights are what's really
important and it's not a matter of

3419
02:18:38,951 --> 02:18:39,550
titles.

3420
02:18:39,550 --> 02:18:43,000
No one want to give a fuck if neither
nate Diaz doesn't have a title.

3421
02:18:43,060 --> 02:18:45,160
And conor mcgregor is not the
welterweight champion.

3422
02:18:45,161 --> 02:18:48,250
If he gave up his title,
that wouldn't mean a goddamn thing.

3423
02:18:48,290 --> 02:18:49,740
The war.
So great.

3424
02:18:50,380 --> 02:18:54,670
Former featherweight champion versus
former ultimate fighter winner who

3425
02:18:54,671 --> 02:18:57,370
stopped this guy in a second round of
their last fight.

3426
02:18:57,371 --> 02:18:59,980
It's a spectacular fight and the trash
is so good.

3427
02:19:00,010 --> 02:19:01,160
Oh,
it's a giant fight.

3428
02:19:01,161 --> 02:19:02,860
Steroids.
How you take that back?

3429
02:19:02,990 --> 02:19:03,850
All right.
Steroids.

3430
02:19:04,050 --> 02:19:05,140
Yeah,
it's a giant.

3431
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:06,580
What have I ever done?
I've never done it.

3432
02:19:06,760 --> 02:19:08,380
Steroids.
Yeah,

3433
02:19:08,710 --> 02:19:13,540
so correct.
Nate and nate was an flap ton flappable,

3434
02:19:13,900 --> 02:19:16,120
but all of that last fight,
they were like,

3435
02:19:16,360 --> 02:19:17,840
you got to stop talking to the Reps.
Dot.

3436
02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:18,671
He's like,
why?

3437
02:19:18,671 --> 02:19:20,740
That's how I fight whatever fight in
stockton.

3438
02:19:20,741 --> 02:19:22,300
I fight.
You can't tell him to talk shit.

3439
02:19:22,330 --> 02:19:24,440
What do you mean is that a rental
referee needs to shut the fuck up.

3440
02:19:24,670 --> 02:19:26,290
It's not a rule.
You can't do that.

3441
02:19:26,650 --> 02:19:29,180
There's a lot stuff that referees,
referee's get a little busy in there.

3442
02:19:29,181 --> 02:19:31,700
Sometimes they they,
they interfere too much.

3443
02:19:32,270 --> 02:19:33,830
They talk too much fight.
Come on guys.

3444
02:19:33,831 --> 02:19:34,581
Fight.
Keep it moving.

3445
02:19:34,581 --> 02:19:37,190
Like when they are fighting.
Sometimes I say that like when guys are

3446
02:19:37,191 --> 02:19:39,680
clenching and they have a turncoat what?
Yeah,

3447
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:41,930
there's some referees.
They're just not that good.

3448
02:19:42,150 --> 02:19:42,710
Oh,
right.

3449
02:19:42,710 --> 02:19:43,550
You know,
there's like,

3450
02:19:43,850 --> 02:19:45,830
there's guys that say it when it's
appropriate,

3451
02:19:45,831 --> 02:19:47,630
like herb dean will say it when it's
appropriate.

3452
02:19:47,631 --> 02:19:48,880
Like if someone's like,
they're stalling,

3453
02:19:48,881 --> 02:19:51,380
he's great.
He's a gold standard.

3454
02:19:51,381 --> 02:19:53,360
Him and mccarthy are the gold standard
to the best.

3455
02:19:53,990 --> 02:19:55,220
And uh,
Josh Rosenfeld,

3456
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:57,700
I would tell you this,
I saw once at the Pearl,

3457
02:19:58,510 --> 02:19:59,640
I saw,
um,

3458
02:19:59,770 --> 02:20:02,380
her being called a fight and,
uh,

3459
02:20:03,490 --> 02:20:05,560
people were booing early stoppage,
early stoppage,

3460
02:20:06,040 --> 02:20:08,570
and I saw him walk out of the optic
octagon optic on it.

3461
02:20:08,890 --> 02:20:12,850
I saw him walking out of the octagon and
look at the replay and watch it.

3462
02:20:12,851 --> 02:20:14,940
I saw him watch it and then he sees the
replay go.

3463
02:20:15,250 --> 02:20:16,540
Yeah.
Like he was like,

3464
02:20:16,620 --> 02:20:17,453
I did the right thing.

3465
02:20:17,720 --> 02:20:18,381
Yeah.
He,

3466
02:20:18,381 --> 02:20:21,410
um,
he and I had a conversation after the

3467
02:20:21,411 --> 02:20:23,000
Tim Silvia fight.
Yeah.

3468
02:20:23,030 --> 02:20:26,810
Tim Silvia fought Frank Mir and the
audience is booing cause he stopped the

3469
02:20:26,811 --> 02:20:31,610
fight because they didn't see it.
But I saw it because I had the replay in

3470
02:20:31,611 --> 02:20:34,430
front of me and the spleen,
the audience didn't have a screen that

3471
02:20:34,470 --> 02:20:36,380
they could call it from the truck
instantly.

3472
02:20:36,381 --> 02:20:39,110
So they had to pull it up on the big
screen where you could see frank's arm

3473
02:20:39,111 --> 02:20:40,190
break.
Uh,

3474
02:20:40,460 --> 02:20:42,110
so,
or excuse me,

3475
02:20:42,140 --> 02:20:43,430
he see Tim's on break.
Yeah.

3476
02:20:43,550 --> 02:20:48,080
So frank got him in an arm bar and
snapped his forum in half,

3477
02:20:48,320 --> 02:20:51,140
and herb was right there and called it,
and the referee,

3478
02:20:51,170 --> 02:20:53,810
the audience was screaming Booboo,
booboo.

3479
02:20:54,170 --> 02:20:56,240
But when I got in there,
I go,

3480
02:20:56,241 --> 02:20:57,140
well,
what's going on?

3481
02:20:57,200 --> 02:20:58,510
I go,
it looks like it was broken.

3482
02:20:58,530 --> 02:20:59,151
He goes,
oh yeah,

3483
02:20:59,151 --> 02:20:59,660
I heard it.

3484
02:20:59,660 --> 02:21:02,990
It snapped.
And so then we played it back to the

3485
02:21:02,991 --> 02:21:03,860
audience and I said,
well,

3486
02:21:03,861 --> 02:21:04,790
watch this.
What's that?

3487
02:21:04,820 --> 02:21:05,720
What's that?
I go,

3488
02:21:05,721 --> 02:21:08,390
that's a broken arm.
And then it showed it to,

3489
02:21:08,410 --> 02:21:09,890
uh,
Tim Silvia and Tim Sylvia,

3490
02:21:09,910 --> 02:21:11,660
thank [inaudible] herb dean after the
fight.

3491
02:21:11,690 --> 02:21:13,250
He's like,
I was complaining about the early

3492
02:21:13,251 --> 02:21:15,110
stoppage,
but you saved my career.

3493
02:21:15,260 --> 02:21:17,900
Like my fucking arm is broken in half.
And so herb was like,

3494
02:21:18,110 --> 02:21:20,660
here are,
you heard the snap saw the bone a lot

3495
02:21:20,661 --> 02:21:23,750
more damage than fucking with it or her
was in the perfect position.

3496
02:21:23,780 --> 02:21:25,460
He's a really good referees as far as
holiday.

3497
02:21:25,461 --> 02:21:26,360
I said,
thank yeah,

3498
02:21:26,510 --> 02:21:29,390
thank you for saving my career.
And finally his fucking arm man,

3499
02:21:29,510 --> 02:21:31,970
because if someone yanks on a compound
fracture and it goes right through the

3500
02:21:31,971 --> 02:21:35,120
skin and the bone birth,
he use all sorts of risk of infection.

3501
02:21:35,380 --> 02:21:37,760
The real serious complications.
I mean,

3502
02:21:37,761 --> 02:21:39,530
who knows if that arms ever going to be
the same again,

3503
02:21:39,760 --> 02:21:44,740
most exciting fight I might've ever seen
Tim Silvia Radica tour in Columbus.

3504
02:21:44,810 --> 02:21:47,050
[inaudible] verify first five they ever
had in Columbus,

3505
02:21:47,340 --> 02:21:48,940
right?
Not passed on the first round.

3506
02:21:49,030 --> 02:21:50,260
And then everyone was like,
what?

3507
02:21:50,470 --> 02:21:51,161
Yeah,
no,

3508
02:21:51,161 --> 02:21:53,130
he can't take the title.
Yeah,

3509
02:21:53,350 --> 02:21:54,430
that's all right.
One one round.

3510
02:21:54,431 --> 02:21:55,264
That's good.
That's good.

3511
02:21:55,360 --> 02:21:56,650
And then went on the second round,
I was like,

3512
02:21:57,110 --> 02:21:58,390
dude,
if he wins one more round,

3513
02:21:58,420 --> 02:22:00,980
he'll win the decision.
Were any big brother to him?

3514
02:22:01,570 --> 02:22:02,403
Beat him five.
Oh.

3515
02:22:02,620 --> 02:22:03,251
And he,
he,

3516
02:22:03,251 --> 02:22:08,200
he stepped in with like the inside leg
kick fake to the big right hand and just

3517
02:22:08,290 --> 02:22:09,760
collaborate.
Tim Silvia.

3518
02:22:10,030 --> 02:22:12,880
And I think tim just totally never
recovered from that and it was probably

3519
02:22:12,881 --> 02:22:15,880
just caught him on the Chin and whopped
him.

3520
02:22:16,330 --> 02:22:18,310
Did you ever see Tim Sylvia when he
fought Ray Mercer?

3521
02:22:18,460 --> 02:22:19,570
Yeah.
Dude,

3522
02:22:19,720 --> 02:22:21,040
that was a crazy idea.

3523
02:22:21,880 --> 02:22:24,440
That was a crazy still fake.
The leg kick timmers like we're not

3524
02:22:24,441 --> 02:22:25,950
going to do it kicks right.
We're under the pussy.

3525
02:22:25,951 --> 02:22:26,490
Shit.

3526
02:22:26,490 --> 02:22:28,740
Fake the leg kick.
This is what was supposed to happen.

3527
02:22:28,950 --> 02:22:30,480
They were supposed to have a boxing
match.

3528
02:22:30,510 --> 02:22:32,910
It's supposed to be Raymar surface tim
silver with a boxing match.

3529
02:22:33,270 --> 02:22:35,700
But because Ray Mercer,
um,

3530
02:22:35,850 --> 02:22:38,970
was a world champion and Tim Silvia
didn't have any pro boxing matches,

3531
02:22:39,060 --> 02:22:41,610
the section isn't sanctioned.
So they had to make it mma,

3532
02:22:42,510 --> 02:22:43,343
which they say,
hey,

3533
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:45,570
we both know we're just going to do
boxing.

3534
02:22:45,571 --> 02:22:46,141
And they'll be like,
yeah,

3535
02:22:46,141 --> 02:22:46,621
yeah,
yeah.

3536
02:22:46,621 --> 02:22:48,450
Allegedly.
They agreed to that.

3537
02:22:48,630 --> 02:22:52,740
And then Tim Silvia leg kicked him and
Ray Mercer hit him with a haymaker from

3538
02:22:52,741 --> 02:22:55,470
hell.
It was a haymaker on steroids.

3539
02:22:56,190 --> 02:22:59,860
It was a knockout on crack.
Yeah.

3540
02:22:59,880 --> 02:23:01,830
Ray Marcia was a monster when he was
young.

3541
02:23:02,190 --> 02:23:05,730
He could hit a hard,
that's like the last thing that goes

3542
02:23:05,731 --> 02:23:07,570
away with a guy like him.
Here it is like,

3543
02:23:07,710 --> 02:23:08,850
see,
he gets kicked and he's like,

3544
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:10,020
Oh fuck you mother fucker.

3545
02:23:10,020 --> 02:23:12,960
I think we talked about this.
And then he fucking big boy too.

3546
02:23:13,010 --> 02:23:13,890
Boom.
Look at that.

3547
02:23:13,950 --> 02:23:14,820
What does the six eight,
six,

3548
02:23:14,821 --> 02:23:16,380
10 yeah.
Oh,

3549
02:23:16,410 --> 02:23:18,190
he's enormous.
Yeah.

3550
02:23:18,250 --> 02:23:19,800
Oh,
he got slept.

3551
02:23:20,460 --> 02:23:21,061
Look,
watch this.

3552
02:23:21,061 --> 02:23:24,270
Punch womp.
That guy hits so hard for him to catch

3553
02:23:24,271 --> 02:23:26,820
you like that on the chin.
Well,

3554
02:23:27,030 --> 02:23:30,000
mercer,
he was awesome back in the day.

3555
02:23:30,030 --> 02:23:33,990
Ray Mercer was awesome.
Knock out a Tommy Morrison.

3556
02:23:33,991 --> 02:23:35,530
Did you ever see that?
No.

3557
02:23:35,590 --> 02:23:36,660
Tommy Gun,
God,

3558
02:23:37,020 --> 02:23:40,670
one of the most frightening knockouts in
the history of boxing through.

3559
02:23:40,690 --> 02:23:44,130
Sure.
Tommy Morrison was the guy.

3560
02:23:44,190 --> 02:23:46,260
He was the white hope.
Everybody thought he was going to be the

3561
02:23:46,261 --> 02:23:48,300
heavyweight champion.
He was in the rocky movie.

3562
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:52,460
He was this bad ass and he fought
motherfucking Ray Mercer and Ray Mercer.

3563
02:23:52,470 --> 02:23:55,380
Boom.
He catches him with this shot and look

3564
02:23:55,381 --> 02:23:57,930
at this fucking combination.
Boom,

3565
02:23:58,290 --> 02:23:59,430
boom,
boom.

3566
02:23:59,431 --> 02:24:03,480
And Tommy gets caught up in the ropes
here going down.

3567
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:05,880
Look,
his arm gets wrapped up in the ropes and

3568
02:24:05,881 --> 02:24:07,410
look at this.
Boom,

3569
02:24:07,820 --> 02:24:09,430
boom.
He's out.

3570
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:10,470
Boom,
standing up.

3571
02:24:10,471 --> 02:24:13,680
The reps try to stop and he's caught.
He was caught in the road.

3572
02:24:13,870 --> 02:24:15,330
Should have been down,
dude.

3573
02:24:15,331 --> 02:24:17,550
It was brutal.
It was brutal.

3574
02:24:17,551 --> 02:24:21,810
It's one of the worst Kaos ever and
Morrison came back from that,

3575
02:24:21,811 --> 02:24:24,960
but not really.
That's amazing.

3576
02:24:25,080 --> 02:24:28,950
He was always fucked up from that.
That fight was just devastating.

3577
02:24:29,850 --> 02:24:33,900
He got tired.
He the anxiety of the event and the fact

3578
02:24:33,901 --> 02:24:35,430
that ray mercer hit so hard,
you know,

3579
02:24:35,431 --> 02:24:37,830
you're always nervous.
You always scared and then he got

3580
02:24:37,831 --> 02:24:40,020
caught.
Bang started slowing down and got

3581
02:24:40,021 --> 02:24:42,900
caught.
Ray Mercer could close the fucking show

3582
02:24:42,901 --> 02:24:45,150
too.
Speaking of fights,

3583
02:24:45,570 --> 02:24:47,610
speaking of fights,
Greg Fitzsimmons is going to doing a

3584
02:24:47,611 --> 02:24:50,250
fight story in the next,
next season of this is not happening.

3585
02:24:50,340 --> 02:24:51,630
Oh,
are you a plugging,

3586
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:54,330
plugging?
I didn't realize I was doing it,

3587
02:24:54,630 --> 02:24:56,880
but it is every Tuesday night you got
just three episodes left.

3588
02:24:57,030 --> 02:24:59,850
Didn't you just say you're going to be
some more soon doing standup comedy

3589
02:24:59,851 --> 02:25:01,530
perhaps this weekend by the thought
about Tempe,

3590
02:25:01,531 --> 02:25:06,531
Arizona at the Improv at Tempe Improv.
What I place the great.com you go to our

3591
02:25:06,541 --> 02:25:11,541
website one oh five the zoo.
If you enter in your email address,

3592
02:25:11,740 --> 02:25:14,340
you can win tickets to see Irish.
A fair.

3593
02:25:14,400 --> 02:25:17,060
Alright.
Most likely we'll just said no.

3594
02:25:17,070 --> 02:25:19,400
Yo,
this is for sure you guys.

3595
02:25:19,440 --> 02:25:21,510
You can dvr the show for sure.
I'd like you to do that.

3596
02:25:21,511 --> 02:25:24,100
Rod Whites on this week with me during
that story about Chinese

3597
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:25,570
shit squat toilet.
Oh Nice.

3598
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:27,490
Yeah.
I worked it into like a long nice story

3599
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:29,680
bias.
If you google or youtube search,

3600
02:25:29,681 --> 02:25:31,150
this is not happening.
Playlist.

3601
02:25:31,420 --> 02:25:34,810
You'll see the unedited versions of
these long form stories.

3602
02:25:35,020 --> 02:25:38,290
71 videos up right now.
Diaz has probably four of them.

3603
02:25:38,350 --> 02:25:41,890
That's beautiful.
Rogan has to us all out,

3604
02:25:41,891 --> 02:25:44,260
man at the Improv lab and side,
bro.

3605
02:25:44,440 --> 02:25:45,340
12 people.
Bella.

3606
02:25:45,341 --> 02:25:46,610
Donna was one of them.
Bella,

3607
02:25:46,620 --> 02:25:47,890
Donna.
She wasn't the audience.

3608
02:25:47,980 --> 02:25:50,020
Whatever happened to her.
She looked tired.

3609
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:53,100
She got out of the business.
I don't really come across porn hub

3610
02:25:53,110 --> 02:25:55,480
anymore.
They just get out of the businessman.

3611
02:25:55,920 --> 02:25:56,531
But yeah.
But yeah,

3612
02:25:56,531 --> 02:25:59,080
I started with nothing Diaz and Marin
was in the first one.

3613
02:25:59,170 --> 02:26:00,760
Did you start from the bottom?
Now you're here.

3614
02:26:00,820 --> 02:26:02,260
I guess so.
I guess

3615
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:06,430
now the whole crew's here.
That's might be true.

3616
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:08,500
I think that really holds true.

3617
02:26:08,830 --> 02:26:10,870
I mean,
it's an arguable this point,

3618
02:26:11,530 --> 02:26:13,360
dawn and from the bottom.
Now we're here.

3619
02:26:13,390 --> 02:26:15,460
This is not in three weeks in the season
finale.

3620
02:26:15,550 --> 02:26:18,850
So a cyborgs in the UFC now too.
That's amazing.

3621
02:26:18,880 --> 02:26:20,530
I just heard that from you.
We're open pool.

3622
02:26:20,710 --> 02:26:21,940
Yeah.
Finally,

3623
02:26:22,700 --> 02:26:23,770
finally.
Yeah.

3624
02:26:24,040 --> 02:26:29,040
At one 41 40 fights it.
35 yes.

3625
02:26:29,740 --> 02:26:33,840
And she's going to fight Leslie Smith
who fights at one 35 she's the girl at

3626
02:26:33,841 --> 02:26:37,090
her ear exploded or here got torn off by
Jessica.

3627
02:26:37,091 --> 02:26:38,650
I,
what's the problem?

3628
02:26:39,880 --> 02:26:41,410
Well,
it's not a problem,

3629
02:26:41,470 --> 02:26:45,700
but it's a one 40 pound weight class
instead of a one 45 that's the one 45 is

3630
02:26:45,701 --> 02:26:48,640
what she's champion of and Invicta.
And I think the idea is that they

3631
02:26:48,641 --> 02:26:51,490
worried that they don't have enough 145
pound talent.

3632
02:26:53,090 --> 02:26:58,090
I think they didn't have enough hunted
know for sure they didn't have 115 pound

3633
02:26:58,181 --> 02:27:00,550
town.
Some of the third about to give somebody

3634
02:27:00,551 --> 02:27:02,890
a third rematch in five years.

3635
02:27:03,370 --> 02:27:04,420
Like,
come on man,

3636
02:27:05,190 --> 02:27:08,320
what you mean we should tape?
It was like you don't have a deep enough

3637
02:27:08,321 --> 02:27:10,060
weight class if that's what you keep
doing.

3638
02:27:10,090 --> 02:27:12,730
Well sort of,
but I mean that's the same problem

3639
02:27:12,731 --> 02:27:14,740
they're going to have right now at
welterweight.

3640
02:27:14,741 --> 02:27:16,900
The same problem you were talking about
at one 45,

3641
02:27:16,901 --> 02:27:19,740
which has a lot of talent.
There's a lot of town at one 45 and

3642
02:27:19,750 --> 02:27:20,760
men's.
Oh yeah.

3643
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:22,630
You know,
so this is what I think.

3644
02:27:22,660 --> 02:27:23,493
I think,
uh,

3645
02:27:23,500 --> 02:27:28,150
first of all she's fucking terrifying to
talk about like one of the scariest

3646
02:27:28,151 --> 02:27:30,850
female strikers in mma,
cyborgs terrifying.

3647
02:27:31,060 --> 02:27:32,860
And Tony and I got in trouble because
we,

3648
02:27:32,861 --> 02:27:34,690
uh,
said some inappropriate jokes about what

3649
02:27:34,691 --> 02:27:38,050
would a roast be like with her.
All jokes aside.

3650
02:27:38,080 --> 02:27:42,610
Even before that I had tweeted that a,
I would love to see her in the UFC for

3651
02:27:42,611 --> 02:27:44,020
sure.
The name,

3652
02:27:44,021 --> 02:27:46,450
she's a monster.
And I think also we shouldn't have

3653
02:27:46,451 --> 02:27:49,720
double standards as far as who takes
performance enhancing drugs,

3654
02:27:49,721 --> 02:27:53,650
whether it's for men or for women.
Like it was like things are kind of is,

3655
02:27:53,651 --> 02:27:56,860
I think the way people look at it,
like what a woman is taking testosterone

3656
02:27:57,100 --> 02:27:58,870
versus a man taking testosterone.

3657
02:28:01,600 --> 02:28:03,250
Yeah.
But you know,

3658
02:28:03,251 --> 02:28:04,900
honestly,
like some of the things that men have

3659
02:28:04,901 --> 02:28:07,420
been caught with have been pretty
unnatural as well.

3660
02:28:07,421 --> 02:28:11,260
Like super human levels of testosterone
that don't even exist in medical books,

3661
02:28:11,740 --> 02:28:13,470
you know?
So it's,

3662
02:28:13,690 --> 02:28:17,410
you could argue that it's dangerous
because a woman does change her anatomy,

3663
02:28:17,440 --> 02:28:18,490
whatever.
They're testing her now.

3664
02:28:18,580 --> 02:28:20,140
Yeah,
but your anatomy changes.

3665
02:28:20,200 --> 02:28:20,870
Oh,
right.

3666
02:28:20,870 --> 02:28:23,300
But you have to make a weight class.
It's,

3667
02:28:23,301 --> 02:28:24,080
it's tricky,
man.

3668
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:27,530
I mean it always seen before this holly
Holm things happened and that's all

3669
02:28:27,531 --> 02:28:29,150
fishy too.
What's fishy?

3670
02:28:30,290 --> 02:28:32,840
Rhonda won't take a fight.
I'll take a fight against Holly Holm and

3671
02:28:32,841 --> 02:28:34,190
then it's suddenly like Misha tate when
it's like,

3672
02:28:34,250 --> 02:28:35,390
I'm ready to fight now.
It's like,

3673
02:28:35,470 --> 02:28:36,980
oh no.
She's not necessarily ready to fight

3674
02:28:36,981 --> 02:28:37,700
now.
No,

3675
02:28:37,700 --> 02:28:38,690
she,
she's not.

3676
02:28:38,720 --> 02:28:40,690
She can't find until like November.
She was really,

3677
02:28:40,700 --> 02:28:42,380
she has,
she's got movie obligations.

3678
02:28:42,381 --> 02:28:43,214
They got moved around.

3679
02:28:43,430 --> 02:28:47,960
See that's bad right there.
When the movies get in the way of your

3680
02:28:47,961 --> 02:28:50,030
fights,
like you got to pick one or the other.

3681
02:28:50,060 --> 02:28:51,330
Go in between.
Yeah.

3682
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:53,830
I,
as soon as my fights over,

3683
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:55,880
I can do your movie for the next three
months and then I got her back to

3684
02:28:55,881 --> 02:28:57,940
training.
It's gotta be hard though when you're a,

3685
02:28:58,460 --> 02:29:00,920
you know,
a super celebrity and you're getting all

3686
02:29:00,921 --> 02:29:03,370
this love and everybody wants to put you
in all these different things.

3687
02:29:03,390 --> 02:29:05,330
It's gotta be hard to say no to certain
things obviously.

3688
02:29:05,331 --> 02:29:06,980
But the same shit happens.
A female comics.

3689
02:29:07,160 --> 02:29:08,690
Yeah,
but it's way worse with a fighter

3690
02:29:09,050 --> 02:29:13,280
because a fighter has to be physically
tuned up to go in to do battle and get

3691
02:29:13,281 --> 02:29:15,170
kicked in the fucking way.
We're sort of fighter.

3692
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:18,110
It's just similar where it's like you're
not concentrating on the thing that got

3693
02:29:18,111 --> 02:29:18,590
you there.

3694
02:29:18,590 --> 02:29:20,270
So the thing that got you there is now
suffering.

3695
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:22,730
Maybe you don't care anymore.
Maybe you just want to do movies.

3696
02:29:22,760 --> 02:29:24,710
Okay,
well that happens to a lot of comics

3697
02:29:24,711 --> 02:29:25,730
when they,
they make it,

3698
02:29:25,731 --> 02:29:28,670
all the sudden you start getting movie
offers and TV show offers up.

3699
02:29:28,700 --> 02:29:29,481
Sucks.
Yeah.

3700
02:29:29,481 --> 02:29:31,700
You're um,
you got to spend time in the trenches.

3701
02:29:31,850 --> 02:29:33,380
I'll work out for two weeks before my
special.

3702
02:29:33,381 --> 02:29:34,850
I was like,
oh no,

3703
02:29:34,851 --> 02:29:37,040
you can't do that.
I had a conversation with a guy was on a

3704
02:29:37,041 --> 02:29:38,720
TV show about that.
It was telling me he was doing a

3705
02:29:38,721 --> 02:29:39,560
special,
I'm like,

3706
02:29:39,940 --> 02:29:40,773
what?
When are you doing?

3707
02:29:40,800 --> 02:29:41,620
He's like,
Saturday night,

3708
02:29:41,620 --> 02:29:44,240
I'm going to,
I knew he had been doing like one or two

3709
02:29:44,241 --> 02:29:46,050
sets a week.
It's like,

3710
02:29:46,070 --> 02:29:46,950
whoa.
Hmm.

3711
02:29:47,270 --> 02:29:48,360
All right.
Yeah.

3712
02:29:48,370 --> 02:29:51,770
Like what are you doing?
She wants Julian one or two headlines

3713
02:29:51,771 --> 02:29:52,220
that's a week.

3714
02:29:52,220 --> 02:29:56,360
It's not like he's doing one or two
theaters a week just doing spots.

3715
02:29:56,420 --> 02:29:58,250
It's crazy.
That's a lack of respect for the art

3716
02:29:58,251 --> 02:29:58,971
form.
Well,

3717
02:29:58,971 --> 02:30:01,310
it's not no herself.
Not Knowing,

3718
02:30:01,340 --> 02:30:02,990
not having done it,
you know,

3719
02:30:03,050 --> 02:30:04,730
not,
not often done it the right way where

3720
02:30:04,731 --> 02:30:07,160
you feel better and everything's loose.
You know,

3721
02:30:07,161 --> 02:30:09,560
you think I'm doing well,
my sets are going well.

3722
02:30:10,100 --> 02:30:12,770
We've all made the stringing together an
hour,

3723
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:14,420
four minutes.
Yeah.

3724
02:30:14,421 --> 02:30:17,870
I mean you can,
it's just to do it the right way,

3725
02:30:18,350 --> 02:30:19,930
like the way,
um,

3726
02:30:20,690 --> 02:30:25,340
I think gives it the most time to grow.
You have to have material that you've

3727
02:30:25,341 --> 02:30:29,180
worked on for a long time and you have
to put a lot of effort into it and then

3728
02:30:29,390 --> 02:30:32,360
you have to tighten that shit down and
get a really great comedy shape for

3729
02:30:32,361 --> 02:30:34,130
about two months.
That's what I think.

3730
02:30:34,280 --> 02:30:36,890
I think you need two solid months of
every weekend.

3731
02:30:37,010 --> 02:30:39,290
Smashing it every weekend.
Two shows,

3732
02:30:39,291 --> 02:30:39,951
Friday,
two shows,

3733
02:30:39,951 --> 02:30:42,290
Saturday show on Sunday.
Do spouts during the week.

3734
02:30:42,570 --> 02:30:45,230
And you know what dude?
We feel asked me what's the best show to

3735
02:30:45,231 --> 02:30:45,870
watch.
And I was like,

3736
02:30:45,870 --> 02:30:46,940
I don't know.
They're all the same.

3737
02:30:46,941 --> 02:30:50,090
But if it's my first time on the road,
even in two weeks,

3738
02:30:50,490 --> 02:30:52,910
that the Thursday show,
that first show of the week is not going

3739
02:30:52,911 --> 02:30:55,280
to be the best show.
It depends though.

3740
02:30:55,310 --> 02:30:57,080
It depends.
Sure I could get loose and have fun

3741
02:30:57,081 --> 02:31:00,780
doing during the week and how excited
you are to be in San Francisco and if I

3742
02:31:00,820 --> 02:31:03,080
just performed a Thursday through
Sunday,

3743
02:31:03,081 --> 02:31:04,910
the week before,
so this is the only three days later.

3744
02:31:04,960 --> 02:31:05,810
Right.
Y'All can be sharp.

3745
02:31:06,230 --> 02:31:07,880
But if it's been a few weeks and it's
like,

3746
02:31:07,910 --> 02:31:10,880
but by Saturday of that week,
oh I'm on fire.

3747
02:31:11,390 --> 02:31:14,570
And there's a big difference between
doing Thursday night.

3748
02:31:14,720 --> 02:31:18,920
If you are coming off of a weekend run
of like three,

3749
02:31:19,170 --> 02:31:24,170
five weekends in a row and you're on
fire like one of a whenever.

3750
02:31:24,390 --> 02:31:26,550
One of the times,
the only time I've ever gone on a real

3751
02:31:26,551 --> 02:31:29,700
tour was when I did that thing with
Charlie Murphy and half Ron and we did

3752
02:31:29,701 --> 02:31:32,880
that real men of comedy maximum thing
that that thing,

3753
02:31:32,881 --> 02:31:37,140
man,
we did 22 or 23 dates and you're just

3754
02:31:37,141 --> 02:31:39,050
doing show after show after show after
show.

3755
02:31:39,540 --> 02:31:40,720
Oh,
you get like a,

3756
02:31:40,970 --> 02:31:43,110
like a fucking Samurai sword,
man.

3757
02:31:43,380 --> 02:31:46,020
The blade just gets folded down and
polished.

3758
02:31:46,021 --> 02:31:49,200
And now imagine if you took off half
those days to go shoot a movie,

3759
02:31:49,560 --> 02:31:51,510
how would your final shows up on most of
those days?

3760
02:31:51,511 --> 02:31:52,344
Yeah,
exactly.

3761
02:31:52,380 --> 02:31:53,460
Yeah.
It's no way,

3762
02:31:53,540 --> 02:31:55,560
but it's like everything else.
Everything else.

3763
02:31:55,561 --> 02:31:57,180
I mean,
you don't become a world champion

3764
02:31:57,181 --> 02:32:00,030
fighter without dedicating your life to
it.

3765
02:32:00,270 --> 02:32:03,630
You don't become a great musician
without a lot of rehearsal and a lot of

3766
02:32:03,631 --> 02:32:04,980
planning.
How much you're going to prep before

3767
02:32:04,981 --> 02:32:05,460
your,
uh,

3768
02:32:05,460 --> 02:32:07,470
how many weeks in a row before your next
special you're gonna go,

3769
02:32:07,500 --> 02:32:08,250
what are you going to do?

3770
02:32:08,250 --> 02:32:10,530
No less than no less than eight weeks.
Well,

3771
02:32:10,531 --> 02:32:11,880
first of all,
never t I'm not,

3772
02:32:12,090 --> 02:32:15,120
I've taken like vacations or it took a
vacation last week,

3773
02:32:15,121 --> 02:32:19,470
which I wrote when I was on vacation.
Sometimes I think those vacation plans,

3774
02:32:20,040 --> 02:32:21,870
yeah,
but sometimes I think those vacation

3775
02:32:21,871 --> 02:32:23,400
times where I know I'm not going to
perform it,

3776
02:32:23,401 --> 02:32:26,730
I just write my thoughts down with no
pressure just to fuck around.

3777
02:32:26,731 --> 02:32:31,020
And I get ideas.
I get little seeds that grow from those

3778
02:32:31,021 --> 02:32:32,510
sort of,
you know,

3779
02:32:32,520 --> 02:32:35,490
those,
those introspective sit down moments on

3780
02:32:35,491 --> 02:32:38,800
the beach be presented right now.
So you have to tap this,

3781
02:32:38,820 --> 02:32:40,830
that doesn't have to be presented to an
audience right now.

3782
02:32:40,831 --> 02:32:44,520
So you have two or three days to form
your thoughts fully and really go into

3783
02:32:44,521 --> 02:32:46,170
it five days a week,
whatever it is.

3784
02:32:46,440 --> 02:32:47,870
My point being,
um,

3785
02:32:48,450 --> 02:32:51,450
I'm constantly working,
like I'm not taking any time off besides

3786
02:32:51,451 --> 02:32:53,040
like having a little vacation time.

3787
02:32:53,190 --> 02:32:54,930
Even when I had a vacation,
I came back and I did,

3788
02:32:55,230 --> 02:32:58,260
I gave back on my vacation on Thursday
night and I was performing Friday and

3789
02:32:58,261 --> 02:33:00,530
Saturday night and went right back in,
you know,

3790
02:33:00,600 --> 02:33:02,310
and I'm doing two,
three shows a night.

3791
02:33:02,340 --> 02:33:04,860
I'm doing them a different clubs and
moving around and then I'm gonna run the

3792
02:33:04,861 --> 02:33:06,390
road.
I think you,

3793
02:33:06,520 --> 02:33:07,530
you've got to stay sharp.
You gotta,

3794
02:33:07,531 --> 02:33:11,700
you gotta bear down.
But the last run I accept no less than

3795
02:33:11,701 --> 02:33:14,550
two months,
but every week.

3796
02:33:14,790 --> 02:33:17,310
Yeah.
And on the road every week somewhere.

3797
02:33:17,311 --> 02:33:19,410
It doesn't have to be on the road.
It can be the Irvine Improv.

3798
02:33:19,411 --> 02:33:21,850
It could be Ontario do an hours.
Yes.

3799
02:33:21,990 --> 02:33:25,800
So you're saying seven straight weeks
and then fill them on the eighth.

3800
02:33:25,830 --> 02:33:27,900
Yeah.
And you're not going to take I sometimes

3801
02:33:27,901 --> 02:33:32,370
I thought,
I don't know if I should like take the

3802
02:33:32,370 --> 02:33:34,980
week off before.
So then when Thursday comes wherever I'm

3803
02:33:34,981 --> 02:33:36,360
doing a cap city in October.

3804
02:33:36,360 --> 02:33:39,540
But like when I,
when I do have a little freshness to it,

3805
02:33:39,780 --> 02:33:41,940
you could do that.
I don't know the right way.

3806
02:33:41,941 --> 02:33:44,430
And I also want to do like a garbage
club the week before that

3807
02:33:46,090 --> 02:33:48,510
c level room where I won't have fans and
I can just like,

3808
02:33:48,511 --> 02:33:51,360
let me test,
let me failure where you go as long as

3809
02:33:51,361 --> 02:33:55,380
you put it online and dealer fans,
daisy just lower percentage,

3810
02:33:56,340 --> 02:33:58,740
just like I don't have a drug as people,
you know,

3811
02:33:59,850 --> 02:34:03,030
he felt for Ted Cruz,
you know those people,

3812
02:34:03,690 --> 02:34:05,940
they're not on the coast.
Um,

3813
02:34:06,120 --> 02:34:08,940
I don't know man.
I think it's different for everybody.

3814
02:34:08,941 --> 02:34:10,230
So you're going to do eight straight
weeks.

3815
02:34:10,231 --> 02:34:11,070
That's great.
You're going to be,

3816
02:34:11,071 --> 02:34:13,410
so you're going to be fire.
I think you have to,

3817
02:34:13,860 --> 02:34:15,600
I think you could also like,
um,

3818
02:34:15,630 --> 02:34:20,410
during the weekdays I got to do like ice
house sets and or Tuesday night.

3819
02:34:20,460 --> 02:34:22,540
No,
but like do not just store sets but do

3820
02:34:22,541 --> 02:34:25,930
long sets during the week too.
He's got to hammer it down man.

3821
02:34:26,170 --> 02:34:27,160
And you,
you'll know,

3822
02:34:27,161 --> 02:34:28,960
you'll know if you're burning,
you know,

3823
02:34:28,961 --> 02:34:31,330
if you're not feeling that good about it
and you'll know if it's,

3824
02:34:31,331 --> 02:34:32,111
it's,
you know,

3825
02:34:32,111 --> 02:34:34,300
you're feeling good.
But I think,

3826
02:34:34,301 --> 02:34:35,134
um,

3827
02:34:36,630 --> 02:34:37,980
I dunno man.
It's exciting stuff.

3828
02:34:38,580 --> 02:34:39,420
Yeah,
you're a

3829
02:34:42,220 --> 02:34:47,080
correct whatever.
Fucking just the fire math or fire.

3830
02:34:48,070 --> 02:34:49,900
I'm into it right now.
Really into it.

3831
02:34:49,990 --> 02:34:50,823
Loving it,
man.

3832
02:34:50,990 --> 02:34:52,780
And other thing is coming back to the
store,

3833
02:34:53,050 --> 02:34:55,750
which has been a little over a year now.
You know,

3834
02:34:55,810 --> 02:34:56,880
I feel it though.
Fuck.

3835
02:34:57,250 --> 02:34:58,510
Love it.
Very happy.

3836
02:34:58,810 --> 02:35:01,210
Perfect move.
It feels like it's being away from.

3837
02:35:01,211 --> 02:35:02,110
It was great.
It's your home.

3838
02:35:02,111 --> 02:35:04,390
You were at war for a while or something
that you got back home and everything's

3839
02:35:04,391 --> 02:35:05,590
normal again.
That's better.

3840
02:35:05,710 --> 02:35:09,040
It's better than young crop is better.
E Bay has completely changed,

3841
02:35:09,100 --> 02:35:11,280
changed the game,
reached out to people like foot.

3842
02:35:11,360 --> 02:35:12,640
And Hannibal and just be like,
hey,

3843
02:35:12,700 --> 02:35:15,670
whatever the system was,
here's the number to call and call and

3844
02:35:15,671 --> 02:35:18,280
every Monday we were one of the best
comics in the country.

3845
02:35:18,281 --> 02:35:19,114
Just come,
come on.

3846
02:35:19,240 --> 02:35:21,770
Adam came to get me.
Well I came by it.

3847
02:35:22,120 --> 02:35:23,020
Why me?
I came,

3848
02:35:23,080 --> 02:35:25,090
I wanted to go by there again for two
reasons.

3849
02:35:25,091 --> 02:35:26,560
One,
because you were doing your special

3850
02:35:26,561 --> 02:35:27,640
there.
I knew it had to be there,

3851
02:35:28,390 --> 02:35:29,223
so I was like,
okay,

3852
02:35:29,260 --> 02:35:30,280
thank you.
That meant a lot to me.

3853
02:35:31,210 --> 02:35:32,530
Yeah,
I had to,

3854
02:35:32,920 --> 02:35:35,560
I was like,
I'm not going to like that.

3855
02:35:35,590 --> 02:35:38,200
It was a huge deal.
Like you getting your first comedy

3856
02:35:38,470 --> 02:35:42,370
central special and you know me being
your friend from when you were a

3857
02:35:42,371 --> 02:35:43,580
doorman.
Yeah.

3858
02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:45,700
Yeah.
Door Guy,

3859
02:35:46,750 --> 02:35:49,330
dude.
You know you have a comedy central

3860
02:35:49,331 --> 02:35:50,920
special and it's filming at the store.

3861
02:35:53,920 --> 02:35:57,070
You know,
I was going pretty excited so I decided

3862
02:35:57,460 --> 02:36:01,270
to go the day before for that so I came
down on,

3863
02:36:01,290 --> 02:36:04,160
it wouldn't be like during the special
like Oh my God,

3864
02:36:04,170 --> 02:36:07,570
I chose to get a lot of the work I had
to go like just relax.

3865
02:36:08,020 --> 02:36:10,270
The fact that I was there.
So I went to roast battle and I was

3866
02:36:10,271 --> 02:36:11,170
like,
wow,

3867
02:36:11,200 --> 02:36:14,020
the vibe of this place is crazy.
I was like,

3868
02:36:14,021 --> 02:36:15,730
this is so much better than it was
before.

3869
02:36:16,720 --> 02:36:17,500
It just,
it's,

3870
02:36:17,500 --> 02:36:21,310
the young crop is so much better.
That roast battles insane.

3871
02:36:21,340 --> 02:36:23,590
They've empowered.
Emily has empowered like the door

3872
02:36:23,591 --> 02:36:24,011
guides,
buck.

3873
02:36:24,011 --> 02:36:26,560
If you can come up with a show and you
can get some people there,

3874
02:36:26,620 --> 02:36:27,850
I'll give you the belly room.
Yup.

3875
02:36:27,910 --> 02:36:30,730
Just come up with a show.
I'm looking for you guys to like make

3876
02:36:30,760 --> 02:36:31,840
instead of before.
We're like Mitzi,

3877
02:36:31,841 --> 02:36:32,860
he'll never let us do anything.

3878
02:36:32,950 --> 02:36:33,970
Yeah,
no,

3879
02:36:33,971 --> 02:36:36,850
it's a totally different animal.
It's just way better.

3880
02:36:36,851 --> 02:36:38,770
And it's also,
we've been talking about this,

3881
02:36:38,771 --> 02:36:43,771
that there's people now that became
comedy fans because of the Internet from

3882
02:36:44,051 --> 02:36:48,310
Youtube clips and from podcasts,
and they understand it now and they know

3883
02:36:48,311 --> 02:36:51,160
that that's the place where we fuck
around and work out and they know that

3884
02:36:51,161 --> 02:36:52,990
we're going to be there all the time.
You'd be audience members.

3885
02:36:53,010 --> 02:36:55,780
Yeah.
So you build it and they'll come like,

3886
02:36:55,781 --> 02:36:59,340
you go there now it's fucking mob mob.
Wednesday.

3887
02:36:59,350 --> 02:37:00,760
It's mom's on a Tuesday,
Monday,

3888
02:37:00,761 --> 02:37:02,380
the open mic show,
the employee show,

3889
02:37:02,381 --> 02:37:03,280
they're like,
it's packed there.

3890
02:37:03,281 --> 02:37:05,840
Cause one of the only times you can get
a free show at the comedy store too,

3891
02:37:05,841 --> 02:37:10,050
they sold out 20 nights in the or in a
row and the or.

3892
02:37:10,100 --> 02:37:11,530
Okay.
And people understand what this means

3893
02:37:11,650 --> 02:37:12,940
since it's only,
maybe it's not,

3894
02:37:13,150 --> 02:37:16,100
it's 165 seats.
But when I ran

3895
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:18,830
the cover booth,
there were Tuesdays and Wednesdays

3896
02:37:19,160 --> 02:37:21,830
consistently.
You couldn't start with less than six

3897
02:37:21,831 --> 02:37:23,950
people.
And we wouldn't start shows was start

3898
02:37:23,980 --> 02:37:26,090
nine.
We wouldn't start till like 10 cause we

3899
02:37:26,091 --> 02:37:27,760
put and get six people in there.
Yeah,

3900
02:37:27,761 --> 02:37:31,580
it'd be nobody there six now.
And now it's just

3901
02:37:31,990 --> 02:37:35,680
knowing that those times were only,
I mean less than a decade ago was like,

3902
02:37:35,740 --> 02:37:37,330
wow,
the internet changed.

3903
02:37:37,331 --> 02:37:41,740
The game.
Son Changed the whole game and podcasts

3904
02:37:41,741 --> 02:37:45,100
changed the game.
Everybody's got a Goddamn podcast that

3905
02:37:45,101 --> 02:37:47,200
you're gonna get some fans pills or mark
Marin.

3906
02:37:47,201 --> 02:37:49,990
I mean,
Mark Marin's entire fame is based on a

3907
02:37:49,991 --> 02:37:52,720
podcast.
He didn't get fame from anything.

3908
02:37:53,050 --> 02:37:54,430
I mean a little bit from that,
uh,

3909
02:37:54,431 --> 02:37:56,380
America show.
But that was all kind of gone.

3910
02:37:56,680 --> 02:37:58,090
Yeah,
he had a small base,

3911
02:37:58,120 --> 02:37:59,800
but that's very,
that's how he's got now.

3912
02:37:59,830 --> 02:38:00,550
Yeah.
No,

3913
02:38:00,550 --> 02:38:04,600
I mean now he's famous in America.
He's famous and he's famous because of

3914
02:38:04,601 --> 02:38:06,130
the Internet,
because of podcasting.

3915
02:38:06,490 --> 02:38:08,200
Al madrigals there.
You know what I mean?

3916
02:38:08,201 --> 02:38:09,010
It's like

3917
02:38:09,010 --> 02:38:11,170
here's what's an amazing thing.
It overthrew a fucking government in

3918
02:38:11,171 --> 02:38:13,060
Libya and an and an Egypt.
Yeah,

3919
02:38:13,390 --> 02:38:14,223
yeah,

3920
02:38:16,800 --> 02:38:18,140
yeah.
The Internet is a motherfucker,

3921
02:38:18,150 --> 02:38:21,660
dude.
It's a motherfucker and so the place is

3922
02:38:21,661 --> 02:38:26,460
what it should have always been.
It's the like the best like playground

3923
02:38:26,850 --> 02:38:28,770
for comics,
whatever you want,

3924
02:38:28,800 --> 02:38:32,880
fuck around,
come up with great material and men,

3925
02:38:33,030 --> 02:38:38,030
Oh my God folks,
if you're in town on a night where Brian

3926
02:38:38,280 --> 02:38:41,700
Holtzman is closing out the main room,
just go.

3927
02:38:41,850 --> 02:38:43,920
I mean this is not,
it's not become a thing yet.

3928
02:38:43,950 --> 02:38:47,520
It should be a thing like when people
are talking about like Kennison his

3929
02:38:47,521 --> 02:38:49,020
prime.
I came in late.

3930
02:38:49,650 --> 02:38:50,760
Yeah,
it was all late night.

3931
02:38:50,790 --> 02:38:53,190
I'm telling you,
Bryan Holtzman on Friday night,

3932
02:38:53,370 --> 02:38:56,820
he got on stage at like,
you know like 12 o'clock 1230 or

3933
02:38:56,821 --> 02:38:59,010
something like that.
Three and a half hours into the show.

3934
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:01,590
It's a long show.
If that's the main road that there were

3935
02:39:01,591 --> 02:39:04,350
300 people in there,
there's probably 30 at this point.

3936
02:39:04,380 --> 02:39:05,730
Well,
there's more and more now.

3937
02:39:05,731 --> 02:39:09,990
That's what's interesting.
There was like 60 or 70 so that people

3938
02:39:09,991 --> 02:39:13,020
know that it's happening now because
then as the show goes off forever.

3939
02:39:13,021 --> 02:39:16,230
So if you just,
if you finish your bar at fucking 1130,

3940
02:39:16,430 --> 02:39:18,210
you can just roll in.
I'm telling you,

3941
02:39:18,211 --> 02:39:20,460
he got a second half of it.
He's a fucking animal.

3942
02:39:20,490 --> 02:39:23,760
He is so funny.
And Brian is a guy that was there when I

3943
02:39:23,761 --> 02:39:26,400
first arrived in [inaudible] 94

3944
02:39:26,620 --> 02:39:30,040
it'll help Mitzi found him.
She was in her office upstairs.

3945
02:39:30,041 --> 02:39:31,940
Remember that old office up there and
uh,

3946
02:39:32,410 --> 02:39:34,720
there's a door you can still see.
It's kind of sealed up into the belly

3947
02:39:34,721 --> 02:39:38,650
room from her office.
She heard somebody killing and she was

3948
02:39:38,651 --> 02:39:39,040
like,
well,

3949
02:39:39,040 --> 02:39:40,990
what is this?
She just kind of listened through the

3950
02:39:40,991 --> 02:39:42,860
door and she opened it up and it was
Holtzman offstage.

3951
02:39:43,150 --> 02:39:44,680
Wow.
Get him over here.

3952
02:39:45,640 --> 02:39:46,750
Wow.
Yeah.

3953
02:39:46,751 --> 02:39:48,400
And like a bringer show type thing,
like a,

3954
02:39:48,401 --> 02:39:49,590
you know,
an open mic type thing.

3955
02:39:49,620 --> 02:39:50,940
Just one of my favorite comedians.
He's mean,

3956
02:39:51,010 --> 02:39:54,930
he almost made me Barf once.
Like I was laughing so hard,

3957
02:39:57,250 --> 02:39:59,490
I couldn't even control it.
I want to do any of this.

3958
02:39:59,490 --> 02:39:59,570
He was

3959
02:39:59,570 --> 02:40:01,610
material,
but [inaudible] has been about,

3960
02:40:01,611 --> 02:40:02,900
uh,
Hillary Clinton.

3961
02:40:03,200 --> 02:40:04,280
Yeah.
You can't use it.

3962
02:40:04,340 --> 02:40:08,160
Literally.
So singular and anger he brings to it

3963
02:40:08,161 --> 02:40:08,994
and,
and the,

3964
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:10,880
I mean,
when Charlie's angels came out,

3965
02:40:12,360 --> 02:40:13,400
they used to,
uh,

3966
02:40:13,440 --> 02:40:14,273
uh,
uh,

3967
02:40:14,340 --> 02:40:15,860
uh,
ashtrays at the comedy store.

3968
02:40:16,260 --> 02:40:19,230
Big fucking thick glass ones.
I mean thick and big.

3969
02:40:19,250 --> 02:40:21,210
I mean the size of this alarm clock.
I remember those things.

3970
02:40:21,460 --> 02:40:23,730
Eventually I got the plastic ones,
but they had them up there.

3971
02:40:23,820 --> 02:40:25,520
It's only for the comedians to smoke.
Right.

3972
02:40:25,521 --> 02:40:27,390
If they want it to.
Cause if you did and he goes,

3973
02:40:27,540 --> 02:40:29,700
he's childish.
I don't like that movie because it gets

3974
02:40:29,701 --> 02:40:32,160
women the false impression that they can
defend themselves.

3975
02:40:33,210 --> 02:40:36,450
I am a 220 pound former crack addict,
former marine.

3976
02:40:36,620 --> 02:40:38,320
I will.
And it takes the fucking ashtray.

3977
02:40:38,490 --> 02:40:39,480
Oh,
he just slams it.

3978
02:40:39,500 --> 02:40:41,760
I will close it.
And it just shatters.

3979
02:40:42,030 --> 02:40:46,240
He destroyed a giant glass ashtray
onstage and it's,

3980
02:40:46,290 --> 02:40:47,490
you would say,
that's not funny.

3981
02:40:47,491 --> 02:40:49,370
That's scary.
He's talking about beating women that

3982
02:40:49,371 --> 02:40:52,710
you have to see it.
It's a character,

3983
02:40:52,770 --> 02:40:54,600
but in,
he'll break character occasionally and

3984
02:40:54,601 --> 02:40:57,030
giggle and laugh,
and then he goes back into it.

3985
02:40:57,240 --> 02:40:59,520
Fuck Dude.
The lack of,

3986
02:40:59,521 --> 02:41:01,470
put your heads down if you don't want to
live in the jungle,

3987
02:41:01,471 --> 02:41:02,191
but your eyes,
he almost,

3988
02:41:02,191 --> 02:41:05,880
he would do sometimes bad jokes,
like real stock jokes so he could get

3989
02:41:05,910 --> 02:41:07,830
mad at the crap for not laughing at
them.

3990
02:41:08,260 --> 02:41:10,050
Knocks doctors,
just his own stock jokes.

3991
02:41:10,080 --> 02:41:13,500
Right.
So He'd get mad at the craft or not the

3992
02:41:13,501 --> 02:41:14,850
jump.
So we can go off.

3993
02:41:14,910 --> 02:41:15,640
Yeah.
Well,

3994
02:41:15,640 --> 02:41:18,300
he just wants to be angry,
but it's fucking great.

3995
02:41:19,290 --> 02:41:20,310
Anyway.
Yeah.

3996
02:41:20,580 --> 02:41:21,660
Comedy store.
It's awesome.

3997
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:24,120
That's it folks.
We've got to bring this pitch home.

3998
02:41:24,180 --> 02:41:26,920
I gotta go work for the UFC.
I got some counties do.

3999
02:41:26,940 --> 02:41:29,880
I'm going to find out some secrets you
find out about some fights,

4000
02:41:30,090 --> 02:41:31,550
some shit nobody knows about.

4001
02:41:31,750 --> 02:41:33,990

4004
02:41:38,311 --> 02:41:41,340
Well that's got to happen after cyborg
fights.

4005
02:41:41,341 --> 02:41:43,830
Leslie Smith.
That's in May in Brazil and Brazil.

4006
02:41:44,100 --> 02:41:44,990
Yeah.
Um,

4007
02:41:45,090 --> 02:41:45,990

4008
