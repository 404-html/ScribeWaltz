1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,910
So Jamie Vernon has some facebook stock
for sale.

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,640
He's got,
he's uploaded it to Craig's slowly take

3
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:15,050
it,
take it off my hands.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,960
I think it will bounce back if you guys
don't know what we're talking about.

5
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:20,900
Facebook a apparently Jamie,
you were the one who first told me about

6
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:22,080
it.
Why don't you fill people in?

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,070
From what I saw,
there's something going on like the

8
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:29,090
company's called Cambridge Analytica,
which uh,

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,420
what I've also then learned is that
Steve Bannon used to be the vp of this

10
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:34,880
company,
but that was before he was in the trump

11
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:38,210
campaign.
And they are responsible for scraping

12
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:39,920
millions of users.
Personal information,

13
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:42,890
I think through a couple apps.
Maybe like the,

14
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:45,200
like a personality APP.
If someone took one of a personality

15
00:00:45,201 --> 00:00:46,034
quiz,
right?

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,020
Those online quizzes.
Polls,

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,260
yeah.
But let's be,

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,900
those are morons that answer those
things.

19
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,940
Right.
For the most part where people that are

20
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:58,370
super bored and that's how you get most
of the time,

21
00:00:58,371 --> 00:00:59,570
how you get your,
your facebook,

22
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:01,580
like passwords stolen is from those
things.

23
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,720
So yeah,
or from sneaky emails that tell you your

24
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,740
account's been compromised,
please reenter your password and you

25
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:11,150
know they were doing
well.

26
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:16,151
It doesn't say facebook on the url.
They can be sneaky with their urls to

27
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:19,070
like put something in front of it and
then facebook and you're like,

28
00:01:19,071 --> 00:01:20,240
oh,
it looks like facebook.

29
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:25,190
You know.
So the FTC is looking into this case

30
00:01:25,191 --> 00:01:29,210
right now apparently as of yesterday.
And what I read is they face up to

31
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,240
potentially $40,000 fine for every
infraction,

32
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:34,460
which would total over two million two
trillion dollars,

33
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,900
I'm sorry,
with a t trillion.

34
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,980
So it's a,
there's their stock has tanked.

35
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,460
I think it was like 8% yesterday.
It's at eight and a half so far today

36
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:48,080
it's down to $165 a share.
It was like 185 two days ago.

37
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,540
So,
and then a lot of people that are also

38
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:53,030
not talking about just getting rid of
their facebook account altogether.

39
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,300
I talked about this last night.
I'm on the actual fence of doing that

40
00:01:56,301 --> 00:01:59,600
just because I can't take it anymore.
That's the only place I go to where it's

41
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:01,340
just I get annoyed.
I get in fights,

42
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,070
I have to see my sister talk about trump
every day.

43
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:05,000
You know,
like it's just,

44
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,120
I get it just upsetting now.
It's a very good forum for people that

45
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:13,910
are into political arguments,
like political arguments,

46
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,670
gay rights arguments.
There's a lot of like,

47
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,970
that's like one of the last places where
it's okay to say that you don't think

48
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:21,770
gay people should be married.
Yes.

49
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,540
It's like,
you know,

50
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,580
I know,
um,

51
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,800
I just,
I just know some people that are

52
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:29,570
probably shouldn't know anymore.
Yeah.

53
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,980
And occasionally,
you know,

54
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,910
we're all my real facebook page,
which I never go to.

55
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:36,890
Like if I go to it once a year,
it's a lot.

56
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,930
And that's where all the fake news stuff
is.

57
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:41,930
Like I thought Pam Anderson died the
other day and it was just one of those

58
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:44,240
fake news stories.
And that's always where you find it is

59
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:46,670
on facebook.
Whenever you go and read an article and

60
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:48,620
those,
those two things at the bottom that

61
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:50,600
like,
you should see what she looks like now.

62
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,180
And there's like 30 of them.
Like wait a minute.

63
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:55,490
Like they just throwing shit at you.
Yeah.

64
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,080
They just literally like,
come on,

65
00:02:57,081 --> 00:02:58,790
you're going to bite on one of these.
Come on.

66
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,280
What is it,
Kevin Costner.

67
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,760
You can't believe what he looks like now
you remember that girl from precious.

68
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,080
You can't believe it often.
Does it work though?

69
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,920
Check.
So every so often right now I don't need

70
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,480
more.
I take got me a few times in the early

71
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,310
days.
Google it.

72
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,960
Yeah.
Well I thought that those were below c.

73
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,170
It's a sneaky thing because they took
the place of real stories.

74
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,230
It's like it used to,
you go to CNN and everything would be

75
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:22,120
cnn,
but now you go to CNN,

76
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:26,770
everything's CNN up a dual line and then
below the line it's like sponsored

77
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:27,521
content.
Like wait,

78
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:27,821
wait,
wait,

79
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:28,151
wait,
wait,

80
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:28,870
wait,
wait.

81
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,230
This isn't,
this is so sneaky cause this is barely

82
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:35,140
an ad.
This is like an article on CNN that

83
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:39,280
takes you to some new place and every
page,

84
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,150
like you have to keep changing pages.
And every page is like one paragraph,

85
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,190
like one paragraph on what Kevin Costner
looked like in 1980 okay.

86
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,980
What about 81 boom.
Next page in [inaudible] 81 Kevin

87
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,970
Costner started to gain weight.
You're like,

88
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,920
yeah.
And then there's usually not the photo

89
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:56,530
that you want to see.
You know how like the thumbnail has like

90
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:58,270
Kevin Costner head blown apart and
you're like,

91
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,000
I want to see that picture.
And it's,

92
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,930
it's not even in there.
It's fake.

93
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,090
Some these sons of bitches clickbait
that insists that and snapchat,

94
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:09,860
I think it should go.
I might be out done with this to the

95
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,290
snapchat.
Rihanna,

96
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,330
Chris Brown thing is crazy.
The fact that somebody green lit that it

97
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:19,720
costs them almost a billion dollars.
Like instantly,

98
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:24,580
weren't they down like some $800 million
or some fucking insane number?

99
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,600
Yeah,
I mean that was,

100
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,520
yeah.
The second time that's happened in a

101
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,270
couple of weeks.
Yeah.

102
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,520
One of them was like Kylie Jenner saying
it sucks.

103
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,190
Right?
The current action.

104
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,580
So 800 million,
they dropped after Rihanna condemned ad

105
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:37,990
making light of domestic violence.

106
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,910
So the question was in the poll,
would you rather slap Rihanna or punched

107
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:44,500
Chris Brown?
Like what would you,

108
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,880
what would you look at this?
Look at that.

109
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,180
Of course everyone wants a punched,
like who wants the slippery on it?

110
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,850
There's a lot of dudes,
there's a lot of assholes out there.

111
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,440
There's got to be probably a sizeable
percentage of the people clicked slap

112
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:01,030
Rihanna just cause they don't like their
life.

113
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,210
Well woke the beach.
I would like to see that.

114
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:06,760
What the results were of this.
Yeah.

115
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:10,720
Well you would have to join the band and
administration and then they get you

116
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:14,180
involved in Cambridge analytics and
you've got to give up your fingerprints.

117
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,240
I don't know how anybody could say yeah,
put that on snapchat.

118
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,590
Like that seems so fucking insane.
That seems like a joke,

119
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,480
like in a movie,
you know,

120
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,270
like can you talk about like a clueless
executive,

121
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,980
you know,
like this is my idea.

122
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:31,420
What do you think?
Lots of clicks,

123
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,860
lots of clicks,
you know,

124
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:36,100
cut to him with a sad face holdings,
boxes,

125
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:39,610
stuff as he's being kicked out of his
office and stay out.

126
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,973
You know.
I mean,

127
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,820
that doesn't seem like something that
something is huge as snapchat.

128
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,460
How could they do that?
They,

129
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,480
they've been fighting,
I mean the whole redesign they did

130
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:51,850
recently.
It already was confusing and annoying to

131
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,580
begin with,
but don't use it at all now it's even

132
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:56,140
worse.
And like every,

133
00:05:56,141 --> 00:05:57,980
they even had a,
a,

134
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,450
a website where,
you know,

135
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,950
every,
a petition to the,

136
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:03,890
to switch back.
I think they got up to a million users

137
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:05,690
saying,
we want the old snapchat back.

138
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,620
And they were like,
no,

139
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,670
it's,
it's better now.

140
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,960
We're in not listening to you.
Oh,

141
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,343
well instagram

142
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,090
listened,
right?

143
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,210
They went back to things being in
chronological order.

144
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,540
Did they do that?
It's,

145
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,190
it's uh,
the tested it.

146
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,850
I was like a Beta test.
It hasn't happened for everyone yet,

147
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:22,250
but it probably will happen or it's
going to become an option soon.

148
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,110
Yeah.
Nobody likes this nonsense.

149
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,080
I'll look at my feed from real recent
and it says,

150
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,580
I'll look at someone's post.
I'll say,

151
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,820
this is yesterday.
And then I look at the time it says 26

152
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:32,511
hours ago.
I'm like,

153
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:34,610
what the fuck is that?
Hate that.

154
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,860
Why are you showing me something from a
day ago?

155
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,251
Yeah.
Like,

156
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:40,400
or I'm going to be here tonight and that
was from like three days ago already.

157
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,250
This concert I've ever seen.
This joe just came out recently.

158
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:44,830
This snapchat,
uh,

159
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,400
opened up their map.
It's called the snap map.

160
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,291
So that,
that word,

161
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,870
the hot zones are where snaps are taking
place right now.

162
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,550
What the universal stories basically
like a stalker map for people that don't

163
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:57,530
have everything private.
But like this is universal studios,

164
00:06:57,531 --> 00:06:59,690
so it's a hot zone.
This is the Hollywood and highland hot

165
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:02,810
zone over here in Ucla.
Hodson where the kids are,

166
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,600
right?
So you can like watch where trends are,

167
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:07,670
things are happening while they're
happening and whatnot.

168
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,690
Makes Sense.
I mean that they can track that.

169
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:13,220
And those spots,
I would assume,

170
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,270
you know,
like Disneyland,

171
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:15,620
right?
It's gotta be a hot zone.

172
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,840
Like anywhere there's a giant population
area.

173
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,850
But what,
I don't even know what the fuck a snap

174
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:21,380
is.
Is it just like a picture?

175
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,560
Just like instagram.
It's like instagram second picture or

176
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,260
video or whatever.
But it goes away if you want it to.

177
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,550
It doesn't have to anymore.
It used to,

178
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:29,400
I used to be the idea.
Yeah,

179
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:31,790
just disappeared.
Yeah.

180
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,390
But everyone competed and so now they
have to keep it around.

181
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:35,700
Right.

182
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,280
So funny how privacy is changed over the
years.

183
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:42,240
Remember aol one or two where it used to
have member directory where you just

184
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:46,140
type in your address and will show you
all the users near your house and then

185
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:48,480
you could just instant message these
people out of the blue and go,

186
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,070
hey,
I you look cute.

187
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:51,960
I lived down the street from you.
You want to hook up?

188
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,200
Like that's how like they even showed
where you were.

189
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,320
Well,
we were talking to him about this

190
00:07:56,321 --> 00:07:59,110
yesterday with Kurt Metzger.
We were talking about Barry crimmins.

191
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,360
How Barry Crimmins,
you know,

192
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,000
Barry Crimmins has a,
um,

193
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:06,400
there was a documentary that bobcat made
forum about him called the Co,

194
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,990
the call me lucky.
Is that what it's called?

195
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,500
Or just lucky call me lucky.
Call me lucky.

196
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,680
Anyway,
in the documentary at details,

197
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:19,681
his battle with AOL where AOL was
allowing people to trade child porn and

198
00:08:20,561 --> 00:08:25,120
they had a policy where if three strikes
and you're out so you could trade trade

199
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:26,800
child porn,
call me lucky.

200
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:30,100
Yeah,
you could trade child porn three times

201
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,460
like and it's fucking insane.
And he,

202
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,240
he actually was a big part of that trial
and bringing it to trial.

203
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,600
Yeah.
The thing is insane that that wasn't

204
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:42,940
that long ago.
That was 20 years ago.

205
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,930
20 years ago you could trade child porn
on AOL.

206
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,220
Jesus.
She like,

207
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,220
and if you got caught they just said,
hey,

208
00:08:51,221 --> 00:08:54,550
don't do that again.
Like now they come to your fucking house

209
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:58,320
and they lock up.
Like it's really interesting how much

210
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:00,480
that's advanced.
You know,

211
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,780
this is what I was going to show you
guys a second ago.

212
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,440
I just saw a story yesterday that never
before the thought I funds could be

213
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,100
cracked.
And now this company has this little

214
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:09,480
box,
which uh,

215
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,180
there's a picture right here.
It's not that expensive.

216
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:15,590
$15,000 gets the police,
300 uh,

217
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,680
licensed unlocks and then they can spend
double and Gav unlimited unlocks and it

218
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:24,090
will unlock every iphone and newer than
an iphone five s it said it.

219
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:27,180
Their pricing structure is weird because
if you get the 15,001,

220
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:30,390
you're only allowed to do it at a
location that's like Geo fenced in.

221
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:31,890
You're not allowed to do it anywhere
else.

222
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,351
Hold on.
Sorry.

223
00:09:32,351 --> 00:09:35,340
Can you just said newer than an iphone
five s it can five,

224
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,990
five s and newer and newer up up to
right now,

225
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:40,430
like you just have a five,
I guess.

226
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,440
Would it be the older operating system?
I think we're going to talk about with

227
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,080
that with phones,
but you might not be able to use those

228
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:46,800
anymore.
You know,

229
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,620
it's just so convenient to do things on
your phone.

230
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,930
That's part of the problem.
You know what I'd take taking the doing

231
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:53,460
lately,
using apple pay,

232
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:54,570
the grocery store,
who,

233
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,610
it's so exciting.
It's very exciting.

234
00:09:56,611 --> 00:09:59,130
It's like I'm living in the future.
I double click it,

235
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,900
sees my face,
you know,

236
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,670
woo.
Oh,

237
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,040
I just bought one of those little square
devices,

238
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,110
you know?
So like if you're selling shirts after a

239
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:09,420
show or something and it has that built
into it,

240
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:11,460
so you could just,
people are just using your iphone is on

241
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:11,730
it.

242
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,720
Whoa.
Yeah.

243
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,200
$20 device you get on Amazon.
That's crazy,

244
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,330
isn't it?
With your Imac is good too.

245
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,030
Yeah.
It's your I Mac,

246
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,520
if you buy something on your Imac and
it's linked to your phone,

247
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,410
it'll just like,
do you wanna use apple pay and then you

248
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:28,890
pull out your phone and confirmed well
on my laptop,

249
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:32,190
but it's a fingerprint I don't have for
like for apple pay.

250
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

251
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:35,640
That's retina scans be paid with your
Apple Watch though.

252
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:38,880
Like a pimp yet cheese.
That's too much.

253
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,050
So I mean like this is gotta be
escalating,

254
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,811
right?
It was.

255
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:46,350
So the people that are sitting back,
the forecasters,

256
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:48,600
they're looking like,
what is technology going to be in 10

257
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:50,700
years?
Like what are they saying?

258
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,830
What's their predictions?
Because this is a,

259
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,640
it's getting into your body somehow.
It's coming in one of the holes.

260
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,970
It's like a dude right now rubbing his
dick on the outside trying to find a

261
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:00,840
place to stick it in.

262
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:05,080
He's got it on your wrist,
he's got it in your pocket and he's,

263
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,190
he's trying to get it into,
your body's got it in your ears.

264
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,270
They're,
they're putting,

265
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,350
you know,
earbuds in like those airpods said it

266
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:15,090
best.
You do fucking Siri with a double tap

267
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,580
and your airpods.
It knows when you're taking him out of

268
00:11:17,581 --> 00:11:19,830
your ear so it pauses your music or
videos.

269
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,070
It's incredible.
They're incredible and they don't fall

270
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:24,990
out when you work out either.
I thought that was gonna be a problem.

271
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,240
We're not as good.
They're not as good for working out,

272
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,810
but the what,
what is is what's actually even better

273
00:11:30,811 --> 00:11:33,900
to me is that for the sound as those
beats threes,

274
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,380
I got those wireless beats ones.
Those things hook over your ear with

275
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:40,770
that little rubber thing and they,
they lock in place that you could get a

276
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:43,380
serious work on him with those on the
airpods there,

277
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,490
they do fall off.

278
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,510
They do fall off occasionally.
They have these skins too to make a

279
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,620
little tighter on Amazon.
Yeah.

280
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:53,110
It's just like just like generic thing
that goes over it to kind of tighten it

281
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:55,060
up in your ear.
It's an awesome idea.

282
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:58,210
It's not perfect.
It would be perfect if they hooked onto

283
00:11:58,211 --> 00:12:01,180
your ear but then they wouldn't be
fitting into that box.

284
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,180
So it's almost like they can't be
perfect cause like part of the thing is

285
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,060
that they fit in a little tiny ass box.
You pop it open,

286
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,940
it's got a little green light on and
it's a battery pack too.

287
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,030
And it's magnetic.
I mean shit that slick.

288
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,460
That's slick.
No one saw that coming either.

289
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,070
That's one of those weird ones where
nobody saw it coming.

290
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,370
You know,
I wasn't really necessary,

291
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,920
but no one saw it in the being necessary
until someone made it.

292
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,320
I think I tell you what's not necessary
is that home pod,

293
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:29,710
they release that thing is just a dump.
They think stocks.

294
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:33,940
I mean it sounds amazing but serious.
So stupid compared to Alexa.

295
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:35,470
It's weird.
Is it Alexis?

296
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:38,710
Just smart as fuck.
And so Amazon's Alexa,

297
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,760
Siri.
And then there's,

298
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:42,790
what about the Google home?
Have you tried that one chart?

299
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,380
That one's supposed to be better too,
I think.

300
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:45,770
I think it probably is.
I mean it's,

301
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,650
if it's the same as the android phone
line,

302
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:51,280
it's good series.
Like that girl that was really hot but

303
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:54,430
decided to stop working out,
you know?

304
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:55,900
And she's like,
she's still pretty hot,

305
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:58,450
but then all these other girls are going
to the gym all the time.

306
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,550
You look at them and like good or bad
though.

307
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:04,720
Look at her legs and series,
just kinda series kind of sloppy.

308
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,670
It's pretty annoying now how many times
my Siri and my Alexis go off just from

309
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:10,660
people going,
Hey Siri,

310
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:12,640
you know,
like on a podcast or something and it

311
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:14,140
just ruins everything.
Yeah.

312
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,600
If you have it set like that,
I mean when we've,

313
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,960
we've probably triggered a thought,
a ton of people just you doing that

314
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:22,180
right there.
People always complain when I say that.

315
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,880
And then there's the,
hey google complaint too.

316
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:25,840
Same thing.
Say,

317
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:27,760
hey google and someone's got their
system,

318
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,580
whatever it is.
What is the thing you're supposed to

319
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:32,500
say?
Hey Google.

320
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,640
Hey,
okay,

321
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,070
go.
You should be able to put anything you

322
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:36,970
want though by now,
right?

323
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,070
Fuck face.
Yes sir.

324
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,710
It should be fuck face.
That would be the best.

325
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,530
Just call your computer.
Fuck face.

326
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,780
My Alexa dig.
When those things were out of the blue.

327
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:49,330
I think it was in the news recently
where he just sitting there and then she

328
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:51,980
just starts laughing and heard about
that too.

329
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,810
Like a witch.
What is that?

330
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,710
I would shoot that thing.
I would take it outside and fill it full

331
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,320
of holes.
Flux.

332
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:02,110
You,
I can't fucking sleep with a robot

333
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:05,470
laughing at my house.
Fuck you wake up to get a drink middle

334
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:06,640
of the night here.
I laugh.

335
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,300
She also,
it's so weird how many Easter eggs she

336
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:12,560
has.
Like she also has like seven songs and

337
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:13,480
out like,
like you go,

338
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:14,830
Hey Siri,
send me a love song.

339
00:14:14,831 --> 00:14:17,430
She will sing you a score on Siri or
Alexa.

340
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,333
Alexa,
Alexa,

341
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,590
sing me a love song.
Love songs.

342
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:21,400
Ready?
Yeah,

343
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,320
that she sings and she has like a rap
song and she has one about technology.

344
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,110
I always wonder what Stephen Hawking
never upgraded his voice.

345
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,220
You didn't want to.
I think,

346
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,710
yeah.
I think I remember reading that he liked

347
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,540
keeping it that way,
but yeah,

348
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,370
I get,
I get it.

349
00:14:36,371 --> 00:14:37,990
That's why he kept it that way.
But I mean,

350
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,060
what,
what kind of logic behind that is that

351
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,570
maybe he just wanted to keep it creepy.
Like if you,

352
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,020
he didn't want to,
he wanted to keep it obviously

353
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,350
electronic.
Whereas there's some places you can get

354
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:52,190
to with some these new

355
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,920
voice things there.
What was that movie?

356
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:58,070
She,
the movers are keen.

357
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,340
Joaquin Phoenix.
That was an interesting movie.

358
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,050
Yeah.
They could have paid anybody to be his

359
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:05,430
voice.
I would imagine that at the time the

360
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:07,600
technology figured out he could have
been Samuel Jackson,

361
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,020
but in a,
yeah,

362
00:15:09,021 --> 00:15:10,180
for Stephen Hawking.
Yeah.

363
00:15:10,181 --> 00:15:12,170
Yeah.
But it probably would sound off like

364
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:14,720
this.
It wouldn't sound like a real

365
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,840
conversation,
you know?

366
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,260
It'd be all,
you know what I mean?

367
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:20,660
It was like you've heard them do that
with voice.

368
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,930
Like when they take people's voices and
they chop them up and try to piece

369
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:26,630
together some sort of audio of something
that they didn't really say.

370
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,540
If they're being obvious about it,
but you know there's technology right

371
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:34,110
now like photoshop that's going to allow
people to Stich audio together and I

372
00:15:34,111 --> 00:15:36,020
believe we've talked about it on the
podcast before.

373
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,910
Yeah,
it's getting better and better.

374
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:42,170
There's a radio lab episode where they
showed where it's at now and it's one of

375
00:15:42,171 --> 00:15:44,990
those things where it's right now it's
not ready.

376
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,200
It's still like if you heard it you go,
oh that's not Brian.

377
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,950
That's a fake conversation put together
from a bunch of shit.

378
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:56,060
Brian said it's like that porn,
that fake porn that was,

379
00:15:56,061 --> 00:16:00,770
that's even more crazy cause they could
just take your face like take pictures

380
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:05,390
and pretty seamlessly stitch your face
onto the character with emotions,

381
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:07,370
with opening mouth,
long linking and stuff.

382
00:16:07,371 --> 00:16:10,700
I've seen some really good ones.
Like the girl from Harry Potter.

383
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,040
Yeah,
well it's what they're doing with

384
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,000
snapchat.
Right?

385
00:16:14,001 --> 00:16:16,700
When someone pretends to be a rick from
the walking dead,

386
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,820
like Deleah did that and I'm like,
God damn,

387
00:16:19,821 --> 00:16:22,610
that's pretty close.
It's pretty close.

388
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:27,050
Like I know that it's obviously that
there's a thing going on here but it's

389
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:29,720
pretty close to what it would really
look like.

390
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,680
Fucks get enough good enough to make you
a whoa.

391
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,630
This wasn't around before.
Like if someone showed you that snapchat

392
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,510
thing that all the girls do where they
put dog faces on and shit and Barf Barf

393
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:43,640
and pretend to be a puppy dog or
Unicorns or whatever.

394
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:48,850
Someone showed you that just 10 years
ago you would be holy Shit.

395
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,680
You wouldn't believe it.
You wouldn't believe it.

396
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,190
You would look at like that thing that
lets you become rick from the walking

397
00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:57,320
dead and you'd go,
what the fuck man,

398
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,760
this is incredible.
If someone showed you that 1998 well how

399
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,970
mind blowing and groundbreaking that
would be.

400
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:10,180
Now it's a part of an APP that's on your
phone that sits in your pocket like what

401
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:14,960
happened and how quick did this happen
and which holds it going in.

402
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,740
It's probably going to be a suppository
just so that the ale,

403
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:21,700
it's like a ironic like that.

404
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:26,120
The aliens have figured out a way to
mock us while defeating us and the way

405
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:30,170
is just to give you the most ultimate
bliss with his tiny little robot deck,

406
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:32,510
you don't even feel it.
It just put this robot dick and your

407
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:36,500
butt's depository and because your
button does nav like skin,

408
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,930
it's not the same.
It's like open tissue.

409
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,420
That's why it's so good for getting
infected.

410
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:46,870
So this little robot can just seamlessly
interact with all that open tissue and

411
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:53,501
that's how you with God,
they're going to talk us in just with

412
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,010
the way they did with these Cambridge
analytics.

413
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,520
They sneak you in the door.
You think it's a personality quiz really

414
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:01,350
electing a dumb president,
you know,

415
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,400
same thing.
You think,

416
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:04,410
well I'm just going to go meet God.
No,

417
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,160
you giving birth to the robot empire
through little tiny robot dicks.

418
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,580
It's not impossible to think,
look,

419
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,670
we're willing to put glasses over our
face so we could see better.

420
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,540
Why wouldn't we put little little metal
bullets up our,

421
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:22,440
but if you found out that it makes life
infinitely better,

422
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,390
they're like,
we can't believe that this is the case.

423
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,230
The only way to do it is up your bud.
You know we've,

424
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:30,360
we've tried and then people like,
oh come on,

425
00:18:30,361 --> 00:18:32,340
I'm not doing that.
And then a few guys do it and they're

426
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:33,930
walking around your neighborhood and
fuck it.

427
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:36,960
Sparkles are coming out of their eyes.
They're so happy.

428
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,080
They're so happy.
They couldn't be happier.

429
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,270
And you're like,
God damn it,

430
00:18:41,271 --> 00:18:43,620
I need to try it.
People are flying.

431
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,300
They're flying around your neighborhood
because they have that robot deck.

432
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,160
Yeah.
Like Andy Stumpf from the s in a

433
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,790
wingsuit.
They're doing that around your

434
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,310
neighborhood but they control it
themselves and it's all because of this

435
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,680
robot Dick,
that Ben Space and time just have to do

436
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:56,070
at once.

437
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,130
Or is it a every day keeping your house
when you take it out of your ass,

438
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:03,670
then you become a normal human and then
eventually they figured out a way to

439
00:19:03,671 --> 00:19:05,610
keep it in there to keep it in there.
Yeah,

440
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,700
they like bolt it to the wall.
Your asshole strap we should but strap,

441
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,090
yeah,
you've got to get it cleaned out every

442
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:13,740
now and then cause shit gets caked on
it.

443
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:15,520
On the way out.
It doesn't,

444
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,560
it doesn't always get the full signal to
your skin,

445
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,720
you know,
do you have to have somebody do it?

446
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,620
I could do it in myself.
I'm not opposed to,

447
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,820
I need to go some doctor sticker,
robot Dick in my butt.

448
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,790
Come on
suck.

449
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,290
If you were like bungee jumping and your
robot dick fell out and all of a sudden,

450
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,290
you know,
sadness in the middle of the day,

451
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,460
that would be crazy.

452
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,930
Look,
we're already doing that with pills,

453
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:42,660
right?
People that are addicted to Xanax and I

454
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:45,810
know a few.
That shit apparently makes you feel

455
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:47,910
great.
Is that the upper or downer?

456
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,800
That's the,
uh,

457
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,820
there's no,
no problems in the world drug.

458
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:55,140
That's an anxiety reliever.
And the people that take it,

459
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:57,300
man,
they get hooked on that shit.

460
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,250
Dom irrera is very open about it.
He takes a shit every day.

461
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,090
He's so great.
He's great.

462
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:05,280
He had him last night on killed Tony.
He's the best of that.

463
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,720
No one's better at killed Tony.
The dumber.

464
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,170
Yeah.
He's so quick,

465
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,570
you know,
and he knows like the most ridiculous

466
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:15,030
shit to say.
Yeah.

467
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,890
But he,
he likes them.

468
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:19,440
Xanax.
I know a lot of Stan hope like xanax

469
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:21,510
too.
It was just joking around about if he

470
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:25,080
got out of a plane and a kiss the floor
when he,

471
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,930
when he landed in America,
it'd be because he saw xanax on the

472
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:28,764
ground.

473
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,440
They love those things.
I'm scared of that shit.

474
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,210
I don't want,
I don't want anything that makes me feel

475
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:39,030
like there's no problems.
I think the only reason why a lot of

476
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:42,150
people don't do it is because they don't
have a friend that has a bunch of Xanax

477
00:20:42,151 --> 00:20:44,130
that's constantly giving them Xanax or
something.

478
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:46,180
Cause I'd never see pills or,
you know,

479
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,230
I'm not around that road at all at like,
oh,

480
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,900
I don't even want a xanax.
Looks like,

481
00:20:49,901 --> 00:20:50,920
you know?
Yeah.

482
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,500
But I bet if we had a friend that always
had xanax on,

483
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:55,090
I'm always [inaudible] Xanax,
you know?

484
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,960
I bet that's how you get into it.
I think somebody just tells you,

485
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:01,290
you need to relax.
You know,

486
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,240
you're like,
but just,

487
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,930
there's so much anxiety.
I mean,

488
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:09,820
the world is filled with possibility.
The world is filled with danger.

489
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,010
The world's filled with good things and
bad things.

490
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,960
I mean,
there's a lot of shit going on.

491
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,890
If you don't have some anxiety,
it must be because you're just choosing

492
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:20,830
to not pay attention.
Like anybody who lives in New York City,

493
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,910
you live in New York City.
I imagine all the shit that's going on

494
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:27,520
around you all the time while you're
just sitting there.

495
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,970
You're supposed to be aware of it.
Just supposed to hope everybody keeps

496
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:33,130
together.
He's supposed to have everybody's cool.

497
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,420
You're,
you're in your apartment.

498
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:37,290
You're on the 13th floor of a 60 floor
building.

499
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,720
It's filled with people.
There's another one right next to it.

500
00:21:40,721 --> 00:21:43,060
There's another one right next to that.
They go all the way down the street.

501
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:45,910
They're filled with people.
People are fucking everywhere and you're

502
00:21:45,911 --> 00:21:49,330
supposed to just be chilled out.
That doesn't make no sense to me,

503
00:21:49,331 --> 00:21:50,560
man.
I'm,

504
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:52,270
I'm with you.
If you're nervous,

505
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,070
you're anxious.

506
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:58,270
You're driving and traffic every day and
people are on their phones and then not

507
00:21:58,271 --> 00:22:00,610
paying attention and everything you eat
gives you cancer.

508
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,620
You're not,
you're not anxious.

509
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,210
Yeah,
I don't understand you.

510
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,920
You should be anxious.
You know,

511
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:08,620
this is the argument for not living the
way we live.

512
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:12,100
It's not the argument for taking a pill
that kills that part of your brain that

513
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:16,720
makes you anxious.
Do you ought to audibly cy a lot?

514
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,150
Mostly for humor.
Yeah.

515
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:24,210
I don't audibly sigh like by myself like
oh but I'll do it like that.

516
00:22:24,581 --> 00:22:25,730
Like for a joke.
Oh

517
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,970
I catch myself more audible audibly
signing more and more.

518
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,320
The order I get like just like little
things where I'll just like look at

519
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:34,630
something like,
oh that kind of shit.

520
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,010
But I didn't used to do that.
Like I'm going to go to oil.

521
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,600
Oil is a good one,
but it's like the things I grew up with.

522
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,640
Oil event.
Is it cultural appropriation?

523
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,640
I have to ask my Jewish friends from La
to start saying Oi Bay.

524
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,760
Yeah.
Cause like nobody ever got mad at

525
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:56,170
anybody who wasn't Italian who'd say
model model and this girl,

526
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,910
nobody cares about those.
You like the use of like fungal.

527
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,840
It's not used that often that it is in
Jersey.

528
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:06,990
Okay.

529
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,470
Go to the east coast.
Go to where those old school guineas

530
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:15,450
landed on boats and fucked each other on
the rocks and made a bunch of them and

531
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:18,720
they all stayed there about fungal.
What's the,

532
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,160
what's the Italian Horn like?
If you're Italian,

533
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:22,450
you know it's happening and had one of
those

534
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:29,580
shows you're a moron.
I don't know.

535
00:23:29,581 --> 00:23:31,950
I don't know where it came from.
We all have them in high school though.

536
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,340
It was like if you had a gold chain with
a horn,

537
00:23:35,341 --> 00:23:37,440
like wow,
look at stylish,

538
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:41,320
did not know that thing existed.
It's called the Costello.

539
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,820
Seen that sperm before,
but that's probably what it is.

540
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,630
Cold sperm,
Little Horn or horn let sometimes

541
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:51,500
abbreviated to Como.
Isn't Italian amulet or talisman worn to

542
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:56,501
protect against the evil eye
or Mala Chico and bad luck in general

543
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:01,940
and historically to promote fertility
and virility.

544
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,880
That's the last thing we need to promote
fertility and kids in high school

545
00:24:04,881 --> 00:24:06,680
wearing those things.
So it is a sperm?

546
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,850
Yeah,
ill Neapolitan.

547
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:13,550
It's called Kumi sallow or variance
thereof.

548
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,350
We talk.
Wow,

549
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,350
that's crazy.
It is just golden.

550
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,380
TJ's on your chest essentially.
Right?

551
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,370
The Golden Tj's or protect you from the
evil eye.

552
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,020
You get me block,
but I still got my not off.

553
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,630
Oh,
dad gave this to me.

554
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,200
The fucking evil eye over here.

555
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,030
Yeah.
What you're wearing it right where a

556
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:43,250
pearl necklace with Lynn too.
Yeah,

557
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,160
it's foul.
What a fowl little amulet.

558
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,630
Imagine they talk those kids into
wearing golden tj's around their neck

559
00:24:50,631 --> 00:24:51,980
and all these years they thought,
hey,

560
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,050
that fucking evil.
I could suck my Dick.

561
00:24:54,051 --> 00:24:55,510
How about that?
I'm like,

562
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:00,110
I'm going to go out and I got a good
amount of gold chains.

563
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,180
I got up.
Good solid fucking horn here.

564
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,550
Look at that.
Can't Catholic priests probably give

565
00:25:04,551 --> 00:25:07,860
them to me it looks like com.
Yeah,

566
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,310
it doesn't even look like a horn.
What kind of fucking Horn is that?

567
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:12,920
Where it's round at the top like a,
like a sperm head.

568
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,450
Horns aren't rounded at the top.
It's all rounded.

569
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:19,000
The top.
It looks like it's swimming up stream

570
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:21,110
and like to the guys.
Madison is going in your mouth.

571
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,060
If you go back,
go back to those pictures of different

572
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:28,120
ones.
Is there anyone that has a flat top that

573
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,140
looks like a fucking horn?
No.

574
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:32,660
All of them are rounded at the top.
Like Jizz,

575
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:37,970
those Italian horns,
they're all rounded at the top.

576
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:39,680
Like Tj's,
this is insane.

577
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,530
I don't see any of them that look,
I go,

578
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,500
that's not an Italian horn.
That's the wrong,

579
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:49,490
that's some,
that's some like Gucci Shit.

580
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,160
Like someone,
some designer got ahold of it and the

581
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:55,700
new take on the Italian horn,
it's all the rage everyone wears.

582
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,460
Everyone was,
yes,

583
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,570
I've got three on.

584
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,260
I can't believe people wear that shit.
They do.

585
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,020
They can't help themselves.
They grow up in those communities.

586
00:26:09,021 --> 00:26:10,550
I did it too.
I wore one.

587
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,030
You're around a bunch of,
uh,

588
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,360
east coast Italian people.
They're all wearing it.

589
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:16,220
You're all wearing it.
It's like,

590
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:18,050
God,
you got yet Italian horn.

591
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,520
And when I,
when I saw the guy that had it on,

592
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:23,180
he took,
I got,

593
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,520
yeah,
I got in and kissed it.

594
00:26:24,521 --> 00:26:28,910
So he kissed the ges.
It's just my good luck,

595
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:31,760
judge.
God bless you.

596
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,570
God bless you.
What saint be Saint Peter,

597
00:26:35,571 --> 00:26:36,990
right?
Yeah.

598
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:38,451
Right.
I mean,

599
00:26:38,451 --> 00:26:40,550
it's gotta be which one's attached to
it.

600
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,580
That's like weird.
Like there's always affiliations,

601
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,980
like certain saints are

602
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,930
attached to certain,
you know,

603
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,360
fucking ridiculous.
It's all those ancient immigrant

604
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:54,270
cultures,
but is it any different really than like

605
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:59,271
looking back at like aol in 1996
trafficking porn people are just way

606
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:03,570
different now.
They're just way different.

607
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,800
Like human beings are way more aware of
shit today.

608
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:12,950
Even if they're misinformed.
They're at least more aware of a lot of

609
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:17,670
things in 1990 then,
then they were in 1994 [inaudible] 96

610
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,650
it's like,
I would say it's like a several fold

611
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:27,240
increase and how much we're aware of and
what we actually look out in the world.

612
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,340
It's just,
it's a completely different thing now,

613
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,230
don't you think?
Oh yeah,

614
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,090
I see.
What are we doing today that they're

615
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:39,750
going to look back on and go,
those fucking morons.

616
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,390
How did they do that besides
circumcision?

617
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,170
Circumcision is a big one.
The one day they can stop cutting baby

618
00:27:46,171 --> 00:27:47,580
decks and they're going to look back and
go,

619
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:50,670
what the fuck people,
this is crazy,

620
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:51,600
right?
You hope not.

621
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,270
You're taking a baby day.
You don't want to stand out.

622
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,050
No,
I don't like the uncut ones,

623
00:28:01,051 --> 00:28:01,861
man.
It freaked me out.

624
00:28:01,861 --> 00:28:03,570
I think we've talked about this,
but the way they look,

625
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,620
right?
Yeah.

626
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:07,410
Just the luck cause I don't really don't
think that affects you.

627
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,430
I've asked you out there sucking dicks
on the sneak.

628
00:28:09,431 --> 00:28:12,230
KIPP asked and I've heard they smell
more than a regular dick.

629
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,490
Why don't I think you should wash your
deck basically.

630
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,030
Overall though,
the advice I'd give anybody's Dick.

631
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,751
Yeah.
Yeah,

632
00:28:18,751 --> 00:28:21,370
but that's still crazy.
I bet if you trim pussy loves to be

633
00:28:21,371 --> 00:28:23,580
easier to take care of that thing too.
It's still crazy.

634
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,890
Told you that.
It's just nuts.

635
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,280
It's,
it's,

636
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,340
it's a nutty thing that we've just
gotten really accustomed to doing.

637
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,340
Cutting skin off your deck.
Like why?

638
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,950
What and the fact that the majority do
that.

639
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:40,040
What they're going to look back in 2018
they're going to look back at this time

640
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:44,670
period and they're going to go,
how was that possible that they had the

641
00:28:44,671 --> 00:28:47,820
internet,
they had all this knowledge,

642
00:28:47,821 --> 00:28:50,220
all they had,
all these scientific studies that had

643
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:50,760
been done.

644
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,590
They knew about psychology and
ideologies.

645
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:54,640
They knew about the health.
Like what?

646
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,510
Health benefits boat,
bogus fucking health benefits,

647
00:28:57,511 --> 00:29:00,030
all less likely to get the fuck outta
here.

648
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,150
Wash your Dick.
Everybody wash it.

649
00:29:02,151 --> 00:29:05,010
If you're getting AIDS or not getting
aids based on the fact that your

650
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:09,660
circumstances are not circumcised,
you are dancing on such a fine edge in

651
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:14,190
your life.
Like I want to see more data from that

652
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:15,810
study.
I don't want to just see,

653
00:29:15,811 --> 00:29:17,850
do you get aids?
I want to see how fucking,

654
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:22,440
how crazy are you?
The whole thing is crazy cut and baby

655
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:23,460
dicks.
That'd be one.

656
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,913
What else?

657
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,340
Tax exempt shots.
Tax exempt status for religions

658
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,530
yet that one cause otherwise,
why can't I start a religion right now

659
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:39,330
and get tax exempt status?
Why can't you?

660
00:29:39,331 --> 00:29:40,830
You telling me scientology,
you can do it.

661
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,110
How many people makes a religion?
Do you have a number top gimme your

662
00:29:44,111 --> 00:29:45,880
number.
Tell me what your numbers are.

663
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,710
What?
How do you know whether or not someone's

664
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:52,000
legit?
How do you decide that no one should be

665
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,090
tax exempt,
especially someone who's taking in Shit

666
00:29:55,091 --> 00:29:59,080
fucking ton piles of money.
If you're some sort of church or

667
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:02,860
whatever and you're getting donations in
the millions and millions of dollars and

668
00:30:02,861 --> 00:30:05,200
you're like one of them,
Benny Hinn assholes out there driving a

669
00:30:05,201 --> 00:30:08,800
Bentley.
Amazon ANC paid zero federal taxes in

670
00:30:08,801 --> 00:30:13,480
2017 gets 789 million windfall from new
tax law.

671
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,270
They paid zero cause I work.
Yeah,

672
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,970
that Kinda Shit shouldn't happen.
That shouldn't happen either.

673
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,870
But the idea is that a corporation,
now,

674
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:25,600
this is not my idea,
so don't think I'm supporting this.

675
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,750
I have to preface this,
but the idea is that corporations

676
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:33,730
shouldn't pay tax because all of the
individuals who are making money in that

677
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:38,110
corporation already pay taxes.
This is the argument that I've heard and

678
00:30:38,111 --> 00:30:39,220
that made me go,
oh,

679
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:42,010
okay.
And the argument was why might've been

680
00:30:42,011 --> 00:30:43,990
Peter Schiff?
Did he say that to me?

681
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,980
I don't think it was on the air.
Might not have been him.

682
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,570
Shit.
Anyway,

683
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:53,890
sidetrack.
The idea is that a corporation is not an

684
00:30:53,891 --> 00:30:56,410
individual,
so why should it pay taxes?

685
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,740
It's not a person.
It's a conglomeration of people.

686
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,550
Those people already pay taxes.
The corporation has money that it's,

687
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,870
that's piled up right.
And then like it's got a value and it's

688
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:10,870
got,
it's on the stock market and it goes up

689
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:13,810
and it goes down and you know,
and they're always kind of looking to

690
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:18,811
improve their bottom line and universal
constant growth.

691
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,740
But it's not a person.

692
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:28,510
I feel like corporations have gotten
rights like people over the last 20 plus

693
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:29,344
years.
You're right,

694
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,390
they have,
they gotten rights in terms of how much

695
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:34,480
they could donate to charities to uh,
excuse me,

696
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:38,500
political campaigns.
And that used to be not the case.

697
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:42,340
They used to have a limit and now they
are like an individual in which they can

698
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:45,250
donate as much money as they want to.
Political campaigns and doesn't a

699
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:48,070
corporation also act to defend itself?
Sort of like,

700
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,500
yes.
Can you google that,

701
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:53,110
make sure that's true that corporations,
um,

702
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,800
they can donate as much as they want to.
Political campaigns.

703
00:31:56,801 --> 00:31:59,260
Now I think there's,
I want to say this is like

704
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:05,350
during the Obama administration.
Fucking Obama.

705
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,910
Obama,
yeah,

706
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,980
I think this was during the Obama
administration.

707
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:12,250
It's a disturbing one.
That's a disturbing one to me because

708
00:32:12,251 --> 00:32:13,780
that is a,
that a sale.

709
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,780
That's a lot of influence where someone
like a Amazon,

710
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:20,080
I don't think Amazon's evil.
What's the limit wanted to be?

711
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,000
I don't know.
I mean if the limits like hi,

712
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,250
you know,
maxine either thousand dollars,

713
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,980
there's no limit limit to should be a
limit.

714
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,040
But I don't think there is.
There has to be,

715
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,000
well,
I don't know.

716
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,760
How sad is it that I don't know.
I should know.

717
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,730
Okay.
See what we got here.

718
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,090
I've seen various things.
The one I'm right now is that an s

719
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:44,900
corp can uh,
deduct up to 50% of its adjusted gross

720
00:32:44,901 --> 00:32:46,940
income to be,
uh,

721
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,940
as a qualified yes.

722
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,980
No.
How much money can,

723
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,740
no,
there was a law passed and I'm looking

724
00:32:52,741 --> 00:32:54,740
at,
it's not popping up how much money

725
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:01,370
there was a law passed that stated how
much money a corporation can donate to

726
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:04,610
political campaigns.
There was very specific that a

727
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:09,380
corporation is seen as an individual.
When you look up that corporations seen

728
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:12,110
as individual for donation,
political campaigns,

729
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,020
it's just,
it's not in anybody's good at,

730
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:21,170
in anybody's interest that these huge
companies like Amazon or anything that

731
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:25,670
size that is fucking billions of dollars
that they should just be able to get

732
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:30,500
together and influence a politician with
a shit ton of money and then the

733
00:33:30,501 --> 00:33:33,820
politician does their bidding and helps
them be bigger and stronger and it may

734
00:33:33,821 --> 00:33:36,140
be fucks over.
Some people gotta be really careful

735
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:39,710
about that because the politicians could
find a way of arguing it.

736
00:33:39,711 --> 00:33:40,521
Well,
I could see,

737
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:45,050
but what is that how he would vote
without that influence?

738
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,360
No.
So all these politicians and get into

739
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:49,970
those positions are all just influence
peddlers.

740
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,950
They're just peddling influence.
The saying,

741
00:33:51,951 --> 00:33:52,611
listen,
you know,

742
00:33:52,611 --> 00:33:54,680
if you help me,
I'll help you scratch my back.

743
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:57,110
I'll scratch yours.
Then not looking out for the people that

744
00:33:57,111 --> 00:33:59,720
voted them in at all.
They're looking out for the people that

745
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:04,190
paid all the money to make them more
prominent so that people would vote them

746
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:05,990
in.
It's very sneaky,

747
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,480
like it should have been fixed a long
time ago.

748
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,370
It's really,
if you think of all the shit like

749
00:34:10,371 --> 00:34:12,410
insider trading,
that is illegal.

750
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,423
Like if,
uh,

751
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:17,240
if Jamie really did know something about
facebook and then,

752
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:18,830
uh,
he told us and like,

753
00:34:18,831 --> 00:34:20,300
hey dude,
shit's going down.

754
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:24,050
Get rid of all your facebook stock right
now and you and I went crazy and got rid

755
00:34:24,051 --> 00:34:26,060
of it.
We could get in trouble.

756
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,840
Like Paul Ryan's in trouble for it now.
Something thing he goes supposedly was

757
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,910
he sold a bunch of stock.
Oh,

758
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,880
so someone told him and he bailed.
Yeah.

759
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:38,400
See that.
How is that illegal?

760
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:43,610
But it's not illegal to influence
politicians and have corporations spend

761
00:34:44,911 --> 00:34:47,400
shit,
tons of money and then obviously get

762
00:34:47,401 --> 00:34:50,550
preferential treatment and obviously get
laws pushed.

763
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,910
Here it is.
Paul Ryan's sold shares on same day as

764
00:34:53,911 --> 00:34:58,911
private briefing of banking crisis webs.
That seems like a dumb move,

765
00:35:00,241 --> 00:35:01,170
Dude.
Wow.

766
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,950
You got to take the hit.
So now you've got to take the hit their

767
00:35:04,951 --> 00:35:06,180
fellow.
You can't do that.

768
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,700
That's terrible.
Somebody told me you better sell your

769
00:35:08,701 --> 00:35:11,850
toys are us stock right now.
That's what I hear.

770
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,150
But this thing about this guy,
like when Ken,

771
00:35:15,151 --> 00:35:15,984
he

772
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:19,180
like trade those stocks.
You have to wait cause that's what

773
00:35:19,181 --> 00:35:20,710
Martha Stewart got in trouble for it to
you.

774
00:35:20,711 --> 00:35:23,020
Right?
Well she lied about doing it.

775
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:26,620
She got like a,
they found a note that had like the

776
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:30,100
information on or something.
God Damn my memory's dog shit lately.

777
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:33,880
It just real quick on the tax thing,
I think there is a limit but then that's

778
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,640
why super pacs became a thing.
So you can donate to another

779
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,810
organization that's not directly to them
and the neck come back group and give

780
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:42,570
the money as they say,
oh it's just a work around with like a

781
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:46,410
loophole.
You know what the limit is though?

782
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:52,110
I believe it's 2,700 for an individual
and then there's like for a company can

783
00:35:52,111 --> 00:35:55,950
give like up to $10,000 or something.
So it's 2,700 for an individual.

784
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:57,270
That's interesting.
For election.

785
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:57,950
Lot

786
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:01,040
of money,
but not as much money as you would think

787
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:01,730
it would be.
Right.

788
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,320
Look,
you would think it'd be like a million.

789
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,503
Yeah.
You know,

790
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,330
there's a bunch of fucking wackadoos it
would give a million.

791
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,440
The thing is,
man,

792
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:14,690
there's weird things that happen with
politicians that you don't factor in

793
00:36:14,691 --> 00:36:17,480
when you think about bribery.
And one of the weird ones,

794
00:36:17,481 --> 00:36:19,730
his,
did you ever see that movie about the

795
00:36:19,731 --> 00:36:22,550
financial crisis?
Uh,

796
00:36:22,551 --> 00:36:26,380
which one was it called?
Hmm.

797
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,520
Lot inside job.
Inside job.

798
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,100
It's fucking amazing.
But one of the things that had details

799
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:35,780
is how many of these guys were
professors that were making these

800
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:40,520
suggestions,
like working as consultants to the

801
00:36:40,521 --> 00:36:43,940
government making these suggestions that
why not to be horribly irresponsible

802
00:36:43,941 --> 00:36:46,850
financially.
And then those guys get giant jobs

803
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,150
afterwards.
It pay fucking millions of dollars and

804
00:36:50,151 --> 00:36:51,320
you're like,
wait a minute,

805
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,510
what happened here?
You're a professor,

806
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,220
you made these sort of,
you know,

807
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,840
weird suggestions that if you looked at
like in the,

808
00:36:59,841 --> 00:37:00,800
in the movie,
inside job,

809
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,440
he goes over it with these professors
like,

810
00:37:02,441 --> 00:37:03,920
well,
how the fuck could you have thought

811
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:04,610
this?

812
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:05,810
Why did you push this?
Like,

813
00:37:05,811 --> 00:37:07,910
why were you,
why were you guys promoting that?

814
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,960
And then they go on to get these
gigantic fucking jobs at banks.

815
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,161
And you're like,
oh,

816
00:37:13,161 --> 00:37:15,320
this is crazy.
This is like a clear path.

817
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:19,100
Like do the right thing here and then
you're gonna make $5 million a year

818
00:37:19,101 --> 00:37:22,510
here.
And so they all do it and this movie's

819
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,180
really good because in one of the scenes
he's talking to one of these big time

820
00:37:26,181 --> 00:37:28,790
bank guys and in the middle of talking
to him,

821
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:33,530
the guy realizes what's going on and he
gets a real hostile but he keeps going.

822
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,050
He like he,
his arrogance allows him to like keep

823
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:37,970
battling sky,
but it keeps like looking dumber and

824
00:37:37,971 --> 00:37:40,670
dumber because the guy who was doing the
interview is really good.

825
00:37:40,671 --> 00:37:43,040
The Guy who put together this
documentary is really good.

826
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,770
It's an,
it's a fascinating documentary that

827
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:49,670
gives you a real insight into how
complicated,

828
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:54,940
complicated and fucking distorted the
system is.

829
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,510
Like it's very distorted for those
people that are just like those rich

830
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:03,470
banker guys.
All they're doing is moving money.

831
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,690
I didn't have all that money and we do
put money over here and then get it

832
00:38:07,691 --> 00:38:08,524
over.
Pick it up.

833
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,120
Aren't you glad you're not doing that
though?

834
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,380
No,
I don't understand it.

835
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,540
Actually,
I couldn't,

836
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,300
I,
I just can't imagine we still use it.

837
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,090
I mean,
I'm sure some of like Peter Shift could

838
00:38:20,091 --> 00:38:21,650
come in school me and explained it to
me,

839
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,920
but I feel like it should be like one
goat equals one piece of gold.

840
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,790
I think it's an issue go higher than
that.

841
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,090
It just,
it soon as you get into speculation and

842
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:41,970
shorting and oh my God,
buying and selling stock in a company

843
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:45,700
and a company can crash like that.
And that's like,

844
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,540
unfortunately what's happened to babies
r us and toys r us is that they weren't

845
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:53,920
getting killed by Amazon.
It was just them taking debt in and like

846
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,860
this finance company that bought them
just pretty much,

847
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:00,130
you know,
going crazy in depth,

848
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,960
uh,
from bad spending.

849
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:04,750
And it had nothing to do at the boys are
s's business.

850
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:07,090
They were doing fine.
It was all about the finance company

851
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:09,280
that owned them.
That's a sad thing man.

852
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,920
But the,
it might be a good thing for like mom

853
00:39:11,921 --> 00:39:13,750
pop toy stores,
toy stores.

854
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,790
Because here's the thing about toy
stores.

855
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:19,570
As a parent,
kids love to go to the fucking toy

856
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:21,580
store.
It's a fun time.

857
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,760
It's like we're gonna that toys dog woo.
Like if my kids would do something good

858
00:39:27,221 --> 00:39:28,810
or would make a promise like,
hey,

859
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:31,660
if you were going to do this project and
when we're done with this project,

860
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:32,650
you guys could pick out a toy.

861
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:35,620
So you give him like a work reward type
situation.

862
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,860
Do they get fucking crazy?
They're running down those aisles is all

863
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:42,640
his stuffed animals and all these games
and it's an exciting place for little

864
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:44,920
kids.
You can't replicate that online.

865
00:39:44,921 --> 00:39:48,370
It's just not the same.
You're looking through amazon.com or

866
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:50,320
something like that.
It's great that it's very convenient.

867
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:53,500
You can just press,
press one click and have it sent to your

868
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:56,440
house.
But for toy stores in particular,

869
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,060
this is a colossal,
there's a,

870
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,310
there's an opening for sure.
Uh,

871
00:40:00,311 --> 00:40:01,930
for another company,
there's,

872
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:03,950
this is the time to start a new toy
start.

873
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,590
Cause Look,
look at all the toy stores are gone.

874
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:08,080
Like kb toys.
Remember that in the mall that there was

875
00:40:08,081 --> 00:40:10,930
a toy store that was bought by the
company that bought toys are us.

876
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:13,540
So that's gone too now.
Like all the toy stores are gone.

877
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,760
There was a little place up here in
Calabasas.

878
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,030
It was real nice man.
Real tiny little mom and pop place had

879
00:40:19,031 --> 00:40:21,280
real cool toys.
Their kids used to love it,

880
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:24,670
but the guy was telling me like,
guy or Gal want a woman?

881
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,430
I'm a sexist.
I don't remember who it was.

882
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:30,040
I'm thinking of my bid woman them.
But they were saying that no,

883
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:33,730
it was a guy.
Now I remember he couldn't keep it open,

884
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,850
um,
to make money if he's only doing it for

885
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:40,480
fun because he enjoyed it.
It was just barely breaking even.

886
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,360
But it's probably one of those toy
stores where it was mostly like puppets

887
00:40:43,361 --> 00:40:44,350
and like,
like you know,

888
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,320
educational toys and it wasn't like Gi
joes.

889
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:49,780
They had everything.
They had a lot of stuff.

890
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:53,230
They had regular like action figures for
comic books and stuff like that.

891
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,183
What are you doing?

892
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,530
I just,
there's this documentary on Netflix

893
00:40:56,531 --> 00:41:01,060
right now called the toys that made us,
and it's very interesting and like you

894
00:41:01,061 --> 00:41:03,550
learn so much like I showed the history
of Barbie,

895
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,760
Barbie started off as a hooker.
Like it was a hooker doll.

896
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,860
The in Germany.
Come on.

897
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:09,700
Yeah.
Swear to God.

898
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,430
Like they uh,
Google please.

899
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:13,640
Yeah.
There was this tree,

900
00:41:13,641 --> 00:41:16,540
that Barbie doll,
there was a doll that looked exactly

901
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:20,650
like Barbie that they used to guys used
to like carry around and give to women.

902
00:41:20,651 --> 00:41:24,310
And it was like a way of like a flirting
with a woman.

903
00:41:24,311 --> 00:41:24,890
Like,
Hey I,

904
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:27,270
this is what I want to see you wearing
later I want.

905
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:33,120
And so this person came over to Germany
and solve this doll and modeled Barbie

906
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:34,100
right

907
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,100
after this hooker doll.
And so if you look at the original

908
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:39,500
Barbie,
but what it was modeled off of it was

909
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:43,230
just like a creepy looking hooker chick.
I'm sure you can find a picture.

910
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,310
Uh,
but this documentary is so amazing cause

911
00:41:46,311 --> 00:41:48,620
it goes through like all the famous
things in your mind.

912
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,500
I just definitely gonna look into the
history of Barbie.

913
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,960
It's just a documentary.
It just goes to the toys,

914
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,630
the toys that made us,
it's so good.

915
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,860
And it goes through like he man and Gi
Joe Gi Joe is interesting because you

916
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:02,660
know that back in the day,
you know,

917
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,700
releasing a guy doll like,
no,

918
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:06,110
we're not going to make no guides.
All,

919
00:42:06,111 --> 00:42:08,930
no one's going to play that.
But Gi joe ended up being like one of

920
00:42:08,931 --> 00:42:10,980
the biggest toys in the whole entire,
and that's,

921
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,930
you had a call and an action figure.
I used to have Steve Austin,

922
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,940
$6 million man action figures.
You had to call it an action figure

923
00:42:16,941 --> 00:42:18,560
that,
and that's where action figures came

924
00:42:18,561 --> 00:42:19,490
from.
Gi Joe.

925
00:42:19,491 --> 00:42:21,200
That was the way around the doll thing.

926
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,310
Yeah.
Smart move.

927
00:42:23,311 --> 00:42:24,960
Because dolls,
yeah,

928
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:29,880
dolls are not for boys and that funny,
but you could have dinosaurs,

929
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:31,003
right?
Ah,

930
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:36,050
what does that sort of doll?
It's a doll.

931
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,460
It's a daughter.
Sarah doll.

932
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,990
One of them was,
which one was it?

933
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:40,861
No,
gi Joe.

934
00:42:40,861 --> 00:42:44,310
One of those was like a,
they made a whole cartoon and just made

935
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:45,410
the toy.
He man.

936
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,413
Yeah,
yeah,

937
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,930
yeah.
It was just designed to as a marketing

938
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,100
tool.
Yeah.

939
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,610
Yeah.
They decided how do,

940
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:54,040
how are we gonna Fight Star Wars toys?
And we're like,

941
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:57,610
let's make it bigger and stronger.
So if you see a he man doll next to a

942
00:42:57,611 --> 00:42:58,810
star wars toy,
it's like,

943
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,490
well here's this little pussy doll.
You know,

944
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:03,790
so and then they made a cartoon around
it and uh,

945
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:06,730
it's really interesting.
Like you wouldn't think it would be that

946
00:43:06,731 --> 00:43:08,410
interesting.
But even the Barbie part,

947
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:09,401
it was like,
wow,

948
00:43:09,401 --> 00:43:12,040
this is fascinating.
And how they changed barbies.

949
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:15,730
Look every year like nadir sexier made
her like her waist.

950
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,480
Like she gets so much shit because her
waist is really small and light stuff.

951
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:23,050
That's because when you put clothes on
for it to fit and look right,

952
00:43:23,051 --> 00:43:24,780
that's how they had to make her waist
just,

953
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,220
it was more for like the style of the
clothes she was wearing,

954
00:43:27,221 --> 00:43:29,580
not of what it looked like.
It was more like,

955
00:43:29,581 --> 00:43:29,680
like

956
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,240
just to have the doll work.
Right.

957
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:36,980
It's really cool.
It's got to be fucking super hard to be

958
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:40,910
a check and look at like those dolls and
look at your body and go,

959
00:43:40,911 --> 00:43:43,280
what in the fuck?
This is not even possible.

960
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,380
You know,
cause a lot of those dolls,

961
00:43:45,381 --> 00:43:47,960
they're not possible.
But what's really funny is one of the

962
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:51,770
things in the 50s what does the say?
There is the only dog.

963
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:54,860
Yep.
Build Lilly dollars by lily dog can be

964
00:43:54,861 --> 00:43:57,560
bought and tobacco shops,
bars and adult themes.

965
00:43:57,561 --> 00:44:00,770
Toy stores,
Gerber rights men got Lily Dallas's gag

966
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:03,740
gifts at bachelor parties.
Put them on their card dashboard,

967
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:07,040
dangled them from the rear view mirror
or gave them to girlfriends as

968
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:09,350
suggestive keepsake.
What does that mean?

969
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,080
Suggestive keepsake.
Hey look at this,

970
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:16,640
but I want to style this.
Prodo Barbie was just shy of a foot tall

971
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:21,440
with bulging breasts and platinum blonde
ponytail made up for a night on the town

972
00:44:21,441 --> 00:44:23,600
with red puckered lips and blue
eyeshadow.

973
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,910
Wow.
Interesting.

974
00:44:25,911 --> 00:44:27,110
The Journal,
German dolls,

975
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:31,950
heavy makeup and subjectively arched
eyebrows didn't carry to the American

976
00:44:31,951 --> 00:44:32,610
version.

977
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:34,350
That's interesting,
Huh?

978
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,290
They tried to lighten it up a little.

979
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,760
Yeah.
Then they even go into like how her eyes

980
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:44,620
are looking to the side not right at you
and then wants to sneak,

981
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,380
see if she could fuck you in this alley.
Yes.

982
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:48,000
Saint to becoming,
Oh God,

983
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:52,970
they're comics for this little adult.
To what?

984
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:54,020
Yeah,
like a comic.

985
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,400
Oh,
that's hilarious.

986
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:59,210
Lily was witty,
irreverent and sexually uninhibited.

987
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,400
One stripped summarize by Lord who's
Lord,

988
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,720
Lord of the writer,
the writer.

989
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:10,220
Okay.
Shows lily covering her naked body with

990
00:45:10,221 --> 00:45:14,960
a newspaper explaining to a friend.
We had a fight and he took back all the

991
00:45:14,961 --> 00:45:17,420
presence he gave me.
Get it.

992
00:45:17,421 --> 00:45:20,300
She's naked.
Another shows lilly in a bikini.

993
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:24,110
When a police man tells her that two
piece swimsuits are illegal,

994
00:45:24,111 --> 00:45:25,700
she says,
oh,

995
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:29,420
and in your opinion,
which part should I take off that dirty

996
00:45:29,421 --> 00:45:30,254
bitch.

997
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,900
One interesting thing too is like,
you know how Barbara gets so much shit

998
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:35,880
for him,
you know like being a fatter woman

999
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:38,190
having it,
you know the body issues and stuff like

1000
00:45:38,191 --> 00:45:38,941
that.
Shit.

1001
00:45:38,941 --> 00:45:43,200
There was like a workout Barbie and she
had a little scale and the scale was,

1002
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:46,230
had a sticker on it and it was stuck at
a 110 pounds.

1003
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,990
And then there was also a book that came
with it,

1004
00:45:48,991 --> 00:45:52,710
like a cookbook or like a book that's
like how to lose weight on the back of

1005
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:54,590
says don't eat instead.
So that

1006
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,010
came out.
Dude does dark.

1007
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:01,410
Yeah.
And then it talked about how Malibu

1008
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:03,440
Barbie,
like what's the first one that like have

1009
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:06,840
the eye stare right at you.
So it was like more sexual or something

1010
00:46:06,841 --> 00:46:08,190
like that.
It's interesting shit

1011
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:11,110
dude.
You don't want to,

1012
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,780
you know,
I mean that's the thing about those

1013
00:46:13,781 --> 00:46:17,920
dolls and all that stuff is like you're,
you're putting something in a kid's

1014
00:46:17,921 --> 00:46:20,410
head.
This is what an adult looks like,

1015
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,090
but I guess you're doing the same thing
with he-man,

1016
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,790
right?
Oh yeah.

1017
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,730
Like you putting that in a boy's head
and then he gets into the mirror and it

1018
00:46:27,731 --> 00:46:30,970
was like,
that's why people flex and have your

1019
00:46:30,971 --> 00:46:33,210
Italian horn.
They're looking at their muscles in

1020
00:46:33,211 --> 00:46:37,300
their life.
What in comparison to he,

1021
00:46:37,301 --> 00:46:38,440
man,
I'm nothing.

1022
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,590
You know,
that's the argument too about the rock

1023
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:46,630
or anybody who's like some beautiful
muscular cre creature like that.

1024
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,520
It's like how the fuck do you aspire to
that?

1025
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:53,590
But guys don't complain about that Shit.
Like you don't hear a lot of complaints

1026
00:46:53,591 --> 00:46:58,060
about male positive body image.
You know,

1027
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,540
you don't hear that.
Like people don't care if guys are fat

1028
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,320
life guys feel sad because they're fat.
Nobody gives a fuck,

1029
00:47:05,321 --> 00:47:07,990
thank God.
But you know what I mean?

1030
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,950
I mean it's like a,
it's a big deal like fat shaming men.

1031
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,220
When was the last time anybody got
accused of fat shaming a guy?

1032
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,830
It's always a woman,
right?

1033
00:47:17,831 --> 00:47:19,120
It's always,
if you're fat shaming,

1034
00:47:19,121 --> 00:47:22,120
it's implied you're fat shaming a woman
cause he's the only ones who care.

1035
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,820
Come on.
Bird Tom at birth.

1036
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:28,720
That was a different kind of fat.
They got locked up because people found

1037
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,130
it a target like,

1038
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,200
oh well it's,
let's figure out what we can say here.

1039
00:47:32,201 --> 00:47:37,201
Oh it's fat shaming.
But just genuinely unlike untrue,

1040
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:42,190
like with,
without it ever being requested by

1041
00:47:42,191 --> 00:47:45,160
someone.
Like if you just on your own,

1042
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:48,190
you decided that to say that's fat
shaming.

1043
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:50,770
Like you saw it,
you pointed out and it became an issue

1044
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,340
about a public event or a public person
or a public celebrity said,

1045
00:47:54,341 --> 00:47:55,750
I'm,
I'm being fat shamed,

1046
00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:00,580
and it was a man fucking never tested.
It means that it hasn't happened.

1047
00:48:00,581 --> 00:48:02,860
Maybe it has an ID.
I have been paying attention,

1048
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:06,880
but I can't imagine that some guy would
fucking complaint because he has a gut

1049
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:10,660
and someone's fat shaming them publicly.
He would just look at that gut and go,

1050
00:48:10,661 --> 00:48:13,240
fuck the right.
I've got to stop eating.

1051
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:16,660
You know,
like the Tom at birth thing,

1052
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,180
people really did think they were
serious.

1053
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:22,150
That's where it got weird.
Like people would get angry at Bert or

1054
00:48:22,151 --> 00:48:26,020
angry at Tom and they'll pick sides,
but was telling me about this the other

1055
00:48:26,021 --> 00:48:27,970
day.
He hired me to like drive him on this

1056
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:32,560
golf cart for this marathon.
Like in between taking instagram photos

1057
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:37,580
like you imagine you get mad.
That's what I found out.

1058
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,580
It's crazy.
He ran five 33 that's pretty good.

1059
00:48:43,581 --> 00:48:46,360
That's pretty good.
An hour slower than oprah,

1060
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,940
but hey,
he's fat and he drinks a lot.

1061
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,700
What's interesting is like the guy that,
the first place guy,

1062
00:48:51,701 --> 00:48:53,680
the guy that actually,
you know one,

1063
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:56,070
it was like two and a half hours and
says no,

1064
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:59,260
no,
no ones is it that can't be,

1065
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:00,430
and it's,
it's an interest.

1066
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,440
So it's two hours that they can't break.
Right.

1067
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:03,980
They can't break two hours.
Yeah.

1068
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:09,930
I was thinking that it's two years,
so like two 1146 that's what he did.

1069
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,830
Oh my God,
that's the same what?

1070
00:49:11,831 --> 00:49:14,550
Burt was five and a half.
That's insane.

1071
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,790
Runs so,
so fast.

1072
00:49:15,791 --> 00:49:16,900
That's insane.
I can't,

1073
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:19,420
I've tried to run that fast for like a
mile.

1074
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:22,180
It's,
Oh my God,

1075
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:24,130
I didn't know they did it that fast.
I thought like,

1076
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:27,700
I thought it was one of them.
If I was guessing when you said two 30

1077
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:29,680
or whatever the fuck we thought it was,
I would be like,

1078
00:49:29,681 --> 00:49:31,300
well that's like a world record or some
shit.

1079
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:34,060
What did it used to be?
Didn't it used to be three hours,

1080
00:49:34,061 --> 00:49:35,490
like a big deal?
I don't know.

1081
00:49:35,491 --> 00:49:36,370
I'm,
no,

1082
00:49:36,371 --> 00:49:38,110
it was like a three minute mile is the
big deal.

1083
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:39,880
No,
four minute mile.

1084
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:43,580
Right.
Then easiest came out and changed him.

1085
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,980
Easiest changed the game.
You got so much more bounce.

1086
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:50,440
How about this?
Go back to the world record marathon.

1087
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,660
A world record.
Boston Marathon,

1088
00:49:52,661 --> 00:49:56,080
1980 I have a feeling it's like in the
threes.

1089
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:58,110
It probably is.
I mean,

1090
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,510
just wouldn't be world record.
Boston marathon.

1091
00:50:01,511 --> 00:50:05,230
That's a stupid thing to say.
It's a possum marathon record.

1092
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:10,330
Who's the who want it to someone in
20001120302 yeah,

1093
00:50:10,331 --> 00:50:14,920
but that's 2011 I want to go down in
1980 and 19 old record.

1094
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,630
It's been replaced.
Right,

1095
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:20,140
but not the record.
Just like what is the result from 1980

1096
00:50:20,141 --> 00:50:22,840
Boston marathon result in 1980 I want
to,

1097
00:50:22,841 --> 00:50:27,841
I want to say that was probably the last
time I paid attention because I lived in

1098
00:50:28,341 --> 00:50:31,610
Boston.
I don't give a fuck about the La

1099
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:33,110
Marathon.
I hear about it and I go,

1100
00:50:33,111 --> 00:50:34,610
oh,
can't drive there now,

1101
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,200
but I'm not like,
oh,

1102
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:38,270
what a smart thing.
These people were all running on the

1103
00:50:38,271 --> 00:50:41,900
street.
I think the reason why you're

1104
00:50:41,901 --> 00:50:44,810
remembering that it's because that's
when the woman faked the time.

1105
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,610
Oh,
that's right.

1106
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:50,120
That's right.
I forgot about her.

1107
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,160
Oh my God.
That was 1980.

1108
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,150
That's right.
Well she hopped on the tee and they

1109
00:50:56,151 --> 00:50:59,930
busted or people saw her on the tea.
Um,

1110
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,890
what was her time?

1111
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:06,260
Wouldn't just show it the pain.
I remember it.

1112
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:10,790
Well,
just you're a terrible person and talked

1113
00:51:10,791 --> 00:51:13,160
about this cause you keep taking us down
more and more rabbit holes.

1114
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:19,530
1980 [inaudible] 1980 [inaudible]
popping up.

1115
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,090
Okay.
Um,

1116
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:28,150
Boston marathon results.
1980s put an s on that bitch.

1117
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:34,190
Put 1979
results.

1118
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:35,690
If we go,
here we go.

1119
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:39,290
Okay.
What do we got to 2020.

1120
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,240
Wow.
Okay.

1121
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:42,760
I'm way off.
What's still 10 minutes?

1122
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:46,310
Six third place.
Two 47 the first place.

1123
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:49,700
Women's top results.
So women do it in two 47 the man was

1124
00:51:49,701 --> 00:51:53,480
doing in two 2120.
It's fucking crazy.

1125
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:57,620
That is so crazy.
You can run 26 miles and two hours.

1126
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:00,360
20 minutes.
Ooh.

1127
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,870
I would imagine that would have been
like a world record.

1128
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,420
I'm so off,
you know,

1129
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:08,720
but it's,
I wonder what they way,

1130
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:10,970
you know,
that's another thing like Bert,

1131
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:15,590
what's really impressive is how big bird
is births like 350 pounds more than

1132
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:15,770
that.

1133
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:16,640
Probably.
Probably.

1134
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:19,460
Yeah.
He's 800 pounds and he's running out

1135
00:52:19,461 --> 00:52:22,250
there.
Did he get a shoe sponsor?

1136
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:23,570
No.
Why not?

1137
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:25,250
Well,
I need to get a shoe sponsor.

1138
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:28,340
Sports Bra should have got some Reebok's
tight,

1139
00:52:28,341 --> 00:52:30,140
Reebok's.
We run around that tracking.

1140
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,010
They would've,
they would've sent a couple hundred

1141
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:35,780
bucks as well.
Come up with some stuff.

1142
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:36,631
Oh yeah.
There you go.

1143
00:52:36,631 --> 00:52:37,071
Oh,
that's right.

1144
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:37,641
He said,
thank you,

1145
00:52:37,641 --> 00:52:39,020
Nike.
Yeah,

1146
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:41,690
good move.
They should have gave him that marathon

1147
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:45,530
shoe that they created just so that
someone could break two hours and see a

1148
00:52:45,531 --> 00:52:46,430
bird.
Could be the one.

1149
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:48,680
It's supposedly shaves like 4% off of
your time.

1150
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:50,720
That showed the fuck out of here.
How is that possible?

1151
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,610
There's like a,
titanium is crazy.

1152
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:56,900
It means you run a hundred miles.
You get there for mild quicker than you

1153
00:52:56,901 --> 00:52:58,820
did without that.
That shit's ridiculous.

1154
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,630
There's a titanium plate in there.
It's supposed to help propel you

1155
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,400
springs.
You run it on spraying.

1156
00:53:05,401 --> 00:53:07,640
So remember those air shocks,
those Nike Shox,

1157
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:11,270
you'd have springs in your heels.
Look like frog shares.

1158
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:14,030
I mean a beating this dead horse many
times.

1159
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:18,080
Not a bad idea of beat it one more time.
But I like barefoot running.

1160
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:23,780
I run with the smallest,
tiniest amount of soul and it's changed

1161
00:53:23,781 --> 00:53:26,130
my feet.
Like I used to get ice

1162
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:29,910
of completely flat feet.
So if like I stepped in water and then I

1163
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:32,670
stepped like on the tile,
like next to the pool,

1164
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,550
it feels like symantec or something that
we could see my footprint.

1165
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:38,280
You would see a flat cave band
footprint.

1166
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:41,400
Same.
But since I've been running with these,

1167
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:44,640
those are used,
those vibrams four fingers shoes and I

1168
00:53:44,641 --> 00:53:46,260
use a couple of different,
um,

1169
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:48,360
the vose.
I like those,

1170
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:50,520
those are,
they have real good traction in them.

1171
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,170
What about the impact on your knees
though?

1172
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:53,970
And your joints are running on the ball.
You're foot,

1173
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,620
you're foot is a natural shock absorber
to thing is people change the way they

1174
00:53:58,621 --> 00:54:03,621
ran in the 1970s when Nike came out with
that really thick heel for those running

1175
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:07,740
shoes and the idea was that you would
land on the heel and then go for it.

1176
00:54:07,741 --> 00:54:09,630
But that's a terrible way for your foot
to land.

1177
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,000
That's all the shock goes straight to
your knee.

1178
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:15,480
There's no give there.
The only give would be the cushioning of

1179
00:54:15,481 --> 00:54:18,510
the shoe,
but your foot is naturally designed to

1180
00:54:18,511 --> 00:54:20,430
decelerate.
You land on the ball,

1181
00:54:20,431 --> 00:54:22,710
your feet,
your foot decelerates and you go

1182
00:54:22,711 --> 00:54:25,530
forward.
And what it's done is strengthen all the

1183
00:54:25,531 --> 00:54:30,531
muscles in my feet in a crazy way.
Like I mean there's a big difference,

1184
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:35,070
like a big difference and my legs just,
they just work better,

1185
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:38,190
like a more balanced,
it's so crazy like it's,

1186
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,290
it's changed.
Like I think about this,

1187
00:54:40,291 --> 00:54:44,040
I'm like if I was doing this back when I
was like really involved in martial

1188
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:45,710
arts,
I think it would've changed my footwork.

1189
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:49,080
It would have made my,
my movement in and out better and faster

1190
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:51,560
cause like your feet strength.
The,

1191
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:53,790
they'd be,
your fee becomes so much stronger when

1192
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,950
you run hills with no shoes on.

1193
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,630
I mean it's basically,
there's shoes,

1194
00:54:57,631 --> 00:55:00,060
there's a thin tread,
but there's no cushioning.

1195
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:04,140
I mean it's all just,
the tread is like a layer of protection

1196
00:55:04,141 --> 00:55:05,970
from sharp rocks.
That's it.

1197
00:55:05,971 --> 00:55:07,210
You're going to try these.
Oh,

1198
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:10,740
I have those in my ass right now and we
pull it out.

1199
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:13,650
Um,
go pull up Vivo,

1200
00:55:13,651 --> 00:55:16,740
barefoot trail running shoes.
These are the ones that I've been using

1201
00:55:16,741 --> 00:55:19,050
a lot lately and the vibrams five
fingers.

1202
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,300
But the,
the problem with the vibrams is they

1203
00:55:21,301 --> 00:55:25,440
don't have as much tread and um,
when it's muddy,

1204
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,100
you slide all over the fucking place.
And I don't want to fuck my knees up.

1205
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,090
No,
I don't,

1206
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:32,520
that's not those,
those are like Ninja toes.

1207
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:33,660
Hoy.
Aw.

1208
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:35,820
Have you tried running barefoot on the
beach yet?

1209
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,020
Yes,
I've done.

1210
00:55:37,021 --> 00:55:38,820
That.
Has Gotten better for you since you've

1211
00:55:38,821 --> 00:55:40,140
done that?
Yeah.

1212
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,910
Well it's,
everything's better.

1213
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:44,570
What's interesting is that's what it
looks like on the bottom of those.

1214
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:46,680
Cool.
So it's a good tread on the bottom and

1215
00:55:46,681 --> 00:55:49,920
it protects you from sharp rocks.
But that that shoe is super,

1216
00:55:49,921 --> 00:55:52,380
super flexible.
Do you have to trail specific one?

1217
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:54,840
Yeah,
because that's all I'm running on.

1218
00:55:54,841 --> 00:55:58,950
I'm not running on any hard ground and I
have zero problems with my knees.

1219
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,210
Zero,
zero.

1220
00:56:00,211 --> 00:56:04,140
Sometimes my ankles are a little,
I'm a little stiff,

1221
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:06,600
like sometimes they're little still sore
when I first start running,

1222
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:07,710
but I'm like,
well,

1223
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:08,610
no,
Duh.

1224
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,610
Think about all the,
the beating I'm giving them as her.

1225
00:56:10,611 --> 00:56:12,510
Cool.
It was the ones that were now,

1226
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,180
but right now,
as soon as it dries up,

1227
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:16,440
because it's been raining a lot out
here,

1228
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:19,070
soon as it dries up,
I'll go back to those vibram five

1229
00:56:19,071 --> 00:56:23,220
fingers because those things make you
use your toes,

1230
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:28,090
like your shoe is in a coffin man,
like your or your foot rather in your

1231
00:56:28,091 --> 00:56:28,450
shoe.

1232
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:29,680
Is it?
It's like a coffin.

1233
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,720
It wraps it up.
It locks it down.

1234
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,570
It's a cast and your feet don't move.
Right.

1235
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,570
They don't spread out.
Your toes don't grip into the ground and

1236
00:56:37,571 --> 00:56:40,420
push off.
And Steve Maxwell was the first one to

1237
00:56:40,421 --> 00:56:43,630
tell me about that when in in regards to
weightlifting,

1238
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,940
he was like,
you should wait live barefoot and if you

1239
00:56:45,941 --> 00:56:48,670
don't want to wait with barefoot where
those like five finger shoes.

1240
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:51,370
And as soon as I started doing that I
started realizing like,

1241
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,233
oh yeah,
like you,

1242
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:56,410
you push off those toes,
you feel them dig into the ground and,

1243
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:57,310
and,
and,

1244
00:56:57,311 --> 00:57:01,450
and certain exercises.
But if they're all trapped up in a shoe,

1245
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:03,490
it's like it doesn't,
they don't move.

1246
00:57:03,491 --> 00:57:06,100
Right.
It's just they don't expand.

1247
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,800
They don't grip the ground.
They don't look,

1248
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:11,830
they don't dig in.
But when you're running barefoot,

1249
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:12,810
like my,
my,

1250
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:16,820
like I feel the muscles in my feet,
they like afterwards,

1251
00:57:16,821 --> 00:57:18,010
like they get worked out.

1252
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:19,450
Yeah,
like those kinds of things.

1253
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,840
That's exactly what those are.
City ones,

1254
00:57:22,841 --> 00:57:24,160
Huh?
Those are the ones for wearing around

1255
00:57:24,161 --> 00:57:25,090
the city.
Look,

1256
00:57:25,091 --> 00:57:27,610
they look gross.
There's no doubt about it.

1257
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,680
I mean,
you're used to looking at different

1258
00:57:29,681 --> 00:57:32,230
kinds of shoes.
You look at that little tiny slipper

1259
00:57:32,231 --> 00:57:33,850
thing on a dude's like,
Hey,

1260
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,880
get out of here.
What your weird ideas with your fucking

1261
00:57:36,881 --> 00:57:38,770
slipper feet.
But it's just something you got to get

1262
00:57:38,771 --> 00:57:42,190
used to.
I prefer them now and if I don't wear

1263
00:57:42,191 --> 00:57:44,620
those,
I usually wear shit like this.

1264
00:57:44,621 --> 00:57:47,830
Like converse all stars because there's,
there's nothing there.

1265
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:50,170
There's an,
it's like it's totally flat.

1266
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,030
You don't have a raised,
he'll see like that.

1267
00:57:52,031 --> 00:57:54,630
She right there has a raised he air Max
right there.

1268
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,210
Fat,
right?

1269
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:55,840
You're like,
um,

1270
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,340
but those,
those heels,

1271
00:57:57,370 --> 00:58:00,130
that raised heel,
it shortens your achilles tendon.

1272
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:03,490
If you wear those all the time and
we're,

1273
00:58:03,491 --> 00:58:05,740
or wear high heels all the time,
think about it.

1274
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:09,760
You are foot is always in this weird
position where your back,

1275
00:58:09,761 --> 00:58:13,930
the back heel is elevated.
So you're 10 is not traveling as far.

1276
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:17,140
So then when you do something where it
does have to travel far,

1277
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:19,900
it can get ruptured like you'd have,
you can have issues with it.

1278
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,550
It's just not,
it's not.

1279
00:58:21,551 --> 00:58:24,520
It's like you ever heard of like people
that drive cars a lot and they have a

1280
00:58:24,521 --> 00:58:27,280
big fat wallet,
they wind up getting problems with their

1281
00:58:27,281 --> 00:58:30,490
back.
Like they'll get a disc slippage because

1282
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:33,010
you know they're,
they're kind of getting a bulging disks.

1283
00:58:33,011 --> 00:58:38,011
They're always leaning on one side.
You're doing your body a disservice by

1284
00:58:38,441 --> 00:58:42,100
keeping it in an in an unnatural
position or in any sort of static

1285
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:46,120
position for long periods of time.
So when you have a static position like

1286
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,790
sitting with a big fat wallet and your
ass,

1287
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,680
it eventually starts to break you down.

1288
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:54,160
The argument is that that same kind of
shit is happening with heels.

1289
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:57,160
So if you're wearing a sneaker that has
like a heel to it,

1290
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,640
that you are constantly,
especially if you're doing explosive

1291
00:59:00,641 --> 00:59:03,670
exercises,
you're constantly limiting the range of

1292
00:59:03,671 --> 00:59:05,290
your heel.
Does that make sense?

1293
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,440
Yeah.
My,

1294
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:07,990
my,
my thing though is that because I also

1295
00:59:07,991 --> 00:59:11,860
have bad flat flat feet that if I have
like a congress all star,

1296
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:14,440
I feel like I need more support cause I,
it makes me walk right.

1297
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,720
Pig Pig,
you know,

1298
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:18,790
pitch a tent or something like that.
I don't think that's true.

1299
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,680
I think you probably just need to
strengthen your feet.

1300
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:22,550
Yeah,
I think,

1301
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:26,990
I mean it's just,
I just don't think that that's where you

1302
00:59:26,991 --> 00:59:28,280
get support from.
I mean,

1303
00:59:28,281 --> 00:59:30,440
you do get support from that.
If you go on mountaineering or

1304
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:31,940
something,
you know you have to hike.

1305
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:35,780
But if you're looking for like an
overall solution should try to get your

1306
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:36,730
feet stronger.
Yeah.

1307
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:39,620
Doctors,
that Doctor Scholl thing,

1308
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:42,890
you can do it up like put your foot on
it and it tests your walking gait and

1309
00:59:42,891 --> 00:59:45,830
they give you the proper insole.
This kind of help a little bit.

1310
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:47,690
Yeah,
those insoles will definitely help your

1311
00:59:47,691 --> 00:59:48,750
comfort level.
Right.

1312
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:51,320
The thing is like what's causing the
discomfort?

1313
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:54,920
Is it a lack of strength?
Is it a lack of mobility?

1314
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:56,180
Like what,
what are the issues?

1315
00:59:56,181 --> 00:59:58,100
You know,
so it's like if you're going to go

1316
00:59:58,101 --> 00:59:59,770
mountaineering next week,
all right,

1317
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:02,420
you should definitely go and get some
fitted in souls.

1318
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,760
You could,
you should go get some stiff ass boots

1319
01:00:04,761 --> 01:00:07,040
that you know.
I mean that's definitely the way to go,

1320
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:08,360
even if you're mountaineering,
period.

1321
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:12,380
But if we're not talking about that you
want to talk about like a solution for

1322
01:00:12,381 --> 01:00:14,450
your life,
like why do your feet hurt when you do

1323
01:00:14,451 --> 01:00:14,750
things?

1324
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:18,470
Why it might very well be they're not
conditioned well and they're not,

1325
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:23,090
they're not being used correctly because
you're shoving them into these fucking

1326
01:00:23,091 --> 01:00:28,091
casts that we call sneakers.
Hippy talk one on one and my sneakers

1327
01:00:29,181 --> 01:00:31,340
have this new material that's been a lot
of shoots for a while,

1328
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:34,070
but this like fly net material.
So it stretches with your foot.

1329
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,640
Yeah.
Good.

1330
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,350
Yeah.
I mean you don't have to,

1331
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:40,130
they don't need breaking in.
Like she was kind of did for a long time

1332
01:00:40,131 --> 01:00:42,140
in the 80s nineties whatever.
Don't get me wrong man.

1333
01:00:42,141 --> 01:00:44,930
I'll still wear a pair of running shoes
every now and then if I feel are good,

1334
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:47,540
you know?
But I just don't think they should be

1335
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:49,580
worn every day.
I don't think it's a normal thing.

1336
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:51,320
I just,
I definitely don't think you should work

1337
01:00:51,321 --> 01:00:54,650
out in them.
Like in terms of like running in them.

1338
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:58,580
And a lot of the shit that people do,
I mean there's,

1339
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:02,570
they have some shoes.
Like I know a underarmour has a show

1340
01:01:02,571 --> 01:01:06,230
called the speed freak that's um,
pretty flat.

1341
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,120
You know,
there's a lot of these companies are

1342
01:01:08,121 --> 01:01:11,660
making flatter and flatter shoes now,
but people like they sell good,

1343
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:13,430
you know,
you see that big fat,

1344
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:15,640
that big fat.
He'll like go,

1345
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:16,850
Ooh,
look at all that cushioning.

1346
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,340
They like,
it sells good if was hard ones for

1347
01:01:19,341 --> 01:01:21,740
people that work out like it,
it's a big crossfit shoe.

1348
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:23,690
Like Nike's metcon three I think is what
it is.

1349
01:01:23,691 --> 01:01:25,670
It's got that hard plastic and I'm
talking about,

1350
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:27,620
Oh yeah,
that's for squats,

1351
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,840
right?
They want you to have a heel for squat.

1352
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:31,800
People do them and converse or barefoot
though.

1353
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:34,880
They're just a good question.
You know,

1354
01:01:34,881 --> 01:01:37,460
I've heard,
I know some people step on plates.

1355
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:40,400
They'll put like a 10 pound plate on the
ground and they'll,

1356
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:44,720
they'll put their heel on those plates
and they'll do squats that way I'm not,

1357
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:46,820
I don't know who's right or who's wrong
when it comes to that.

1358
01:01:46,821 --> 01:01:48,920
I do everything barefoot,
all lifting,

1359
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:51,140
all lifting.
Either barefoot or with those little

1360
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:54,020
five finger shoes on.
So she was,

1361
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:56,210
aren't you worried about getting
ringworm all over your feet?

1362
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,940
No.
Why do you think you get ringworm?

1363
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:00,260
Aren't gems.
Oh,

1364
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:01,610
I guess you haven't yet.
Private Gym,

1365
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:04,170
like Jim said,
you're just like the dirty subsidiary.

1366
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,660
But here's the,
the thing,

1367
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,150
you know,
ringworm and um,

1368
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:10,940
uh,
athlete's foot at the same thing.

1369
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:12,013
Oh,
okay.

1370
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:13,213
Do you know that?
Yeah,

1371
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:14,900
exactly the same thing.
Yeah.

1372
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:18,620
It's just skin fungus.
The best way to prevent against skin

1373
01:02:18,621 --> 01:02:23,490
fungus have healthy skin flora.
So don't fuck with any antibacterial

1374
01:02:23,491 --> 01:02:26,160
soaps because when you,
unless you're a doctor obviously,

1375
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:29,340
but when you're using antibacterial
soap,

1376
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:32,280
soap on a regular basis,
you're killing everything.

1377
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:37,530
You're killing all the good bacteria to
which you want is soap that promotes

1378
01:02:37,531 --> 01:02:39,660
healthy skin floor,
like defense soap.

1379
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:44,250
They make this soap with tea tree oil
and eucalyptus oil smells good.

1380
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:45,480
Yeah.
And it,

1381
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,400
but it's really healthy for your skin.
It's not,

1382
01:02:47,401 --> 01:02:49,140
there's no chemicals,
there's no bullshit.

1383
01:02:49,141 --> 01:02:52,680
It's just natural oils that promote
healthy bacteria and,

1384
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:56,130
uh,
and they deny the growth of shitty

1385
01:02:56,131 --> 01:02:58,620
bacteria somehow or another.
I mean there's a lot of stuff like that

1386
01:02:58,621 --> 01:03:01,680
in nature that does teach.
Aerial is a big one for that.

1387
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:05,010
Promotes healthy bacteria,
kills off all the bad shit.

1388
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,480
I use it everyday.
And how like just keeping everything

1389
01:03:08,481 --> 01:03:09,410
dry,
you know,

1390
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:11,450
like that's good too.
But what if you live in the jungle

1391
01:03:11,451 --> 01:03:14,810
bitch,
just make sure you're circumcise too.

1392
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:17,420
Oh yeah,
that's probably right.

1393
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:22,160
Sweaty Dick in the jungle.
A lot of ringworm everywhere you're a,

1394
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,920
your body has like a whole system,
you know,

1395
01:03:24,921 --> 01:03:28,400
and that,
that whole system is fortified by you

1396
01:03:28,401 --> 01:03:33,080
eating fermented foods and things that
are probiotic and yogurt and like,

1397
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:35,300
oh,
this is like strategies that people have

1398
01:03:35,301 --> 01:03:39,710
come up with over the years to introduce
probiotic foods into their diet.

1399
01:03:39,711 --> 01:03:42,470
And some of it was by accident by just
trying to preserve things and they

1400
01:03:42,471 --> 01:03:44,630
fermented and some of it was,
you know,

1401
01:03:44,631 --> 01:03:45,800
they figured out like,
Hey,

1402
01:03:45,801 --> 01:03:48,170
you know,
we can do this it and I have a better

1403
01:03:48,171 --> 01:03:49,004
result with that.

1404
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:51,790
And you know,
that's,

1405
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,840
that's really what's the

1406
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:56,300
cause of a lot of skin issues.
I mean,

1407
01:03:56,301 --> 01:03:59,960
you're going to get ringworm anyway.
If you're exposed to it all the time and

1408
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:02,120
you have open sores,
you can't get to a shower in time.

1409
01:04:02,121 --> 01:04:03,710
It's totally likely that you could get
it.

1410
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:07,920
But I guarantee your recovery time and
the instances that you get,

1411
01:04:07,921 --> 01:04:10,910
it will be less likely if you take
acidophilus.

1412
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:12,410
If you take a,
there's a,

1413
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,830
I like Kombucha.
There's a bunch of different probiotics

1414
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:15,703
you can take

1415
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:20,080
and it's just very,
it's a very smart thing for your body.

1416
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:22,990
But that's one of the one things about
diet coke.

1417
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:25,480
I think diet coke all as delicious as it
is.

1418
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,390
Rex,
you're healthy skin flora within your

1419
01:04:28,391 --> 01:04:29,300
gut flora.
Yeah,

1420
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:31,330
it probably does.
I just read the other day,

1421
01:04:31,331 --> 01:04:35,740
like if you drink one diet coke a day,
like something about Alzheimer's.

1422
01:04:35,741 --> 01:04:38,350
I think it is that where there's like a
direct connection to,

1423
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:39,880
uh,
I forget it.

1424
01:04:39,881 --> 01:04:40,990
Fuck it.
What it was,

1425
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:42,610
but uh,
that's pretty,

1426
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:44,800
pretty scary.
Dot cooks so bad.

1427
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:47,230
Took out Tammy Faye Bakker.
Yeah,

1428
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:48,431
that's it.
Took her out,

1429
01:04:48,431 --> 01:04:49,264
right?
That coke.

1430
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:54,670
That's what they say.
Just one can triple your risk of stroke.

1431
01:04:54,970 --> 01:04:57,550
Meanwhile,
Donald Trump drinks 12 a day.

1432
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,310
Done mother fuckers invincible as I
just,

1433
01:05:00,311 --> 01:05:04,430
cokes are probably better for it.
Cuffs do Donald's story.

1434
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:05,830
What?
Mysterious.

1435
01:05:05,831 --> 01:05:08,830
Loch ness type.
Sea Creature washes ashore and Georgia

1436
01:05:08,831 --> 01:05:09,220
beach.

1437
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:10,540
Well,
come on.

1438
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:13,840
It is apparently,
and this just came out yesterday that,

1439
01:05:13,841 --> 01:05:15,760
but they still like marine wildlife
experts,

1440
01:05:15,761 --> 01:05:18,430
quote unquote don't know what it,
that's the only picture of it.

1441
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:19,630
Yeah.
There's this video of it.

1442
01:05:19,631 --> 01:05:21,070
Let me see that again.
Wait,

1443
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:23,080
how big is that?
It's caught five feet long.

1444
01:05:23,081 --> 01:05:26,010
I think it's like a plesiosaur.
That's what they said.

1445
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:28,190
They a certain,
uh,

1446
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,730
sea mammals can decompose to look like
that.

1447
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:31,783
Wow.
No one,

1448
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:34,370
it just showed up on a beach here
showing that video again.

1449
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:35,351
Oh,
there's the picture.

1450
01:05:35,351 --> 01:05:37,270
Get bigger with that.
I blurred out the part where it was like

1451
01:05:37,271 --> 01:05:39,880
a gut or something.
Whoa.

1452
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:43,360
It looks like it's just a piece of
seaweed and it's like at one inch long

1453
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:45,160
and it looks,
that's hilarious.

1454
01:05:45,161 --> 01:05:47,140
They blurt out the guts.
They're going to show you this dead

1455
01:05:47,141 --> 01:05:48,460
body,
but they're blur out the gods.

1456
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,600
No,
go back to the picture.

1457
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:50,630
Live video.
No,

1458
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:51,100
no,
no.

1459
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:53,560
Does somebody see it?
Um hmm.

1460
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:57,500
The flippers are very unusual,
like in that long ass neck.

1461
01:05:57,770 --> 01:05:59,870
That's a very weird animal.
Whatever that is,

1462
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:03,920
that'd be fucking dope if they found
some new crazy looking in Georgia

1463
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,530
dinosaur type fish right off the coast
of Georgia.

1464
01:06:06,531 --> 01:06:08,510
There's so much shit down there.
I mean,

1465
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:13,010
you think about how many different
animals and organisms they are,

1466
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:15,950
um,
constantly finding on earth.

1467
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:16,950
Right?
I mean that,

1468
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,580
that new crayfish that they found in the
ocean,

1469
01:06:19,581 --> 01:06:21,400
that's all female that,
uh,

1470
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:24,260
reproduces by cloning.
If you heard about that one.

1471
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:26,150
There's,
they're finding these fucking things

1472
01:06:26,151 --> 01:06:28,370
constantly that's in fresh water and
wheat,

1473
01:06:28,371 --> 01:06:31,460
but we have a way better account and
understanding of what's going on in

1474
01:06:31,461 --> 01:06:35,810
freshwater and we do of the ocean.
There's so much down there that we don't

1475
01:06:35,811 --> 01:06:37,760
know.
There's so many life forms down there

1476
01:06:37,761 --> 01:06:38,590
that we're not aware of.

1477
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:40,690
Do you know how much of the ocean floor
has been,

1478
01:06:40,770 --> 01:06:44,560
uh,
thinking less than 10% and 5% and why we

1479
01:06:44,561 --> 01:06:46,240
work.
I don't understand why we're so

1480
01:06:46,241 --> 01:06:49,570
concerned about going to a different
planet when we haven't even figured out

1481
01:06:49,571 --> 01:06:51,400
this planet yet.
That's ridiculous.

1482
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:55,030
Then when James Cameron went and as his
movie the movie,

1483
01:06:55,031 --> 01:06:57,520
he made it to go as far down as anybody
has gone.

1484
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:01,930
I was looking into this the other day.
He didn't break the record in 1962 guys

1485
01:07:01,931 --> 01:07:05,530
got into a submarine and went lower than
he did by like a hundred meters or some

1486
01:07:05,531 --> 01:07:06,400
shit.
Whoa,

1487
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:09,280
wait 29,000 feet or something down.
Jesus,

1488
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:13,120
and it's still,
there's still more and I think they just

1489
01:07:13,121 --> 01:07:16,200
discovered an area near where they were
going that's lower than what they

1490
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:18,430
thought.
The deepest part of the ocean was.

1491
01:07:18,431 --> 01:07:22,240
Top there for a second.
29,000 feet under the ground isn't a

1492
01:07:22,241 --> 01:07:22,720
mile.

1493
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:26,440
5,000 feet.
So what?

1494
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:32,350
What are you serious like they're almost
six miles down.

1495
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:37,380
35,797 feet is the actual record.
What in the fuck ban?

1496
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,580
That's seven miles.
Is that real?

1497
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:44,400
Yeah.
Think a seven miles.

1498
01:07:44,401 --> 01:07:49,401
Seven miles is like here to studio city.
The thing that they did under water,

1499
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:54,580
how far can you see?
You can't see seven miles,

1500
01:07:54,581 --> 01:07:55,330
right?
No.

1501
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:57,130
Like the distance of the curve of the
earth.

1502
01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:00,000
The curve of the earth.
Like you gotta find the flat too.

1503
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,150
Yeah.
But if you're flat,

1504
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:03,880
if you're on like a c level and you're
looking straight,

1505
01:08:03,881 --> 01:08:07,750
how far can you see on a clear day?
I think you could probably see seven or

1506
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:08,620
eight mile,
probably farther.

1507
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,410
Hmm.
That's nuts man.

1508
01:08:11,411 --> 01:08:13,000
It's seven miles.
Is this the guy?

1509
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:14,260
Yeah,
there's two guys actually,

1510
01:08:14,261 --> 01:08:15,890
they're still alive.
Uh,

1511
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:16,520
Don Lawson,

1512
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:19,550
jock picard shot and I don't know.
I bet you never recover from something

1513
01:08:19,551 --> 01:08:21,470
like that.
You go all the way down there and you're

1514
01:08:21,471 --> 01:08:22,490
just like,
what in the fuck?

1515
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:25,730
Fuck what the fuck?
What the fuck are DNA probably changes

1516
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:28,640
like that astronaut guy.
Yes.

1517
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:31,740
Some day explained that,
that that was exaggerated,

1518
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,680
that,
that people were,

1519
01:08:33,681 --> 01:08:38,681
I'm oversimplifying simplifying the
situation to say that there is DNA

1520
01:08:39,051 --> 01:08:43,940
didn't change the way you think it did.
It's probably just like one molecule off

1521
01:08:43,941 --> 01:08:45,680
or something like that.
It's probably not that big of a deal.

1522
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:48,020
It's probably off though.
I mean,

1523
01:08:48,021 --> 01:08:48,441
what,
what,

1524
01:08:48,441 --> 01:08:51,010
what,
what are they saying caused him see,

1525
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:54,560
um,
Google astronauts.

1526
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:56,660
DNA didn't change the way you think it
did.

1527
01:08:58,370 --> 01:08:59,300
I think,
um,

1528
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:02,840
we just don't understand like how it
yeah,

1529
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:06,260
no Scott Kelly's DNA did not change in
space.

1530
01:09:06,261 --> 01:09:11,261
And this is from wastes.com the way it's
a weight local news station o w a t

1531
01:09:13,101 --> 01:09:15,380
e.com is probably just an AP story that
had put up.

1532
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:16,760
Yeah,
I think it exactly is.

1533
01:09:16,761 --> 01:09:19,610
Cause I know I saw it on something else.
Get it a little beer so I can read it

1534
01:09:19,611 --> 01:09:20,930
here.
Uh,

1535
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,610
after the Internet was abuzz about
astronauts,

1536
01:09:22,611 --> 01:09:25,430
Scott Kelly's purported altered DNA
after his year in space,

1537
01:09:25,431 --> 01:09:27,680
NASA is clarified the findings in their
study.

1538
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:32,480
His DNA did not change by 7%.
He's still an identical twin to his

1539
01:09:32,481 --> 01:09:33,021
brother.
Mark.

1540
01:09:33,021 --> 01:09:37,940
I want my money back from all those
things I clicked you fuckhead NASA says

1541
01:09:37,941 --> 01:09:42,941
University of Tennessee's graduate,
gene's expression changed by about 7%

1542
01:09:43,491 --> 01:09:47,840
gene expression is how your body reacts
to your environment and stress

1543
01:09:47,841 --> 01:09:49,250
fractures,
fractures.

1544
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:54,580
They said this level of change in gene
expression was within the expected range

1545
01:09:54,591 --> 01:09:58,830
for humans in stressful environments
like scuba diving or Mountain Climb,

1546
01:09:58,831 --> 01:10:00,440
ag biome,
you fucks.

1547
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:04,100
So every time you go mountain climbing,
you're not an identical twin to your

1548
01:10:04,101 --> 01:10:06,620
brother anymore.
We're assholes.

1549
01:10:06,621 --> 01:10:08,060
We're just lying to ourselves.

1550
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:11,060
We just lie to ourselves for clicks.
I'm Matt,

1551
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:13,820
I'm Ha,
I've had enough.

1552
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:18,080
It's like these people need to be
punished for their clickbait.

1553
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:20,960
Yeah,
they're doing it on purpose at its worst

1554
01:10:20,961 --> 01:10:23,570
on like youtube.
I mean you could put up a little

1555
01:10:23,571 --> 01:10:27,710
thumbnail and get people clicking on
stuff and make thousands of dollars just

1556
01:10:27,711 --> 01:10:28,670
for that.
That's true.

1557
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:33,440
I went deep on youtube the other day.
Have you ever watched somebody die from

1558
01:10:33,441 --> 01:10:35,090
rabies?
Oh No.

1559
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:37,940
There's videos of people dying from
rabies on Youtube.

1560
01:10:37,941 --> 01:10:41,690
It's the most fascinating thing ever.
They're like,

1561
01:10:41,691 --> 01:10:43,520
I didn't know people still died from
rabies,

1562
01:10:43,521 --> 01:10:46,550
but there's like people that have rabies
and if you watch it's haunting,

1563
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:49,370
you pretty much are going crazy.
Why don't they just kill them?

1564
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,380
Yeah,
they know why.

1565
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:55,400
Why do we need people to die 100%
naturally?

1566
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,410
Like what is that about?
Like look at,

1567
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,870
I mean it's,
it's so interesting to watch these

1568
01:10:59,871 --> 01:11:01,970
videos,
man.

1569
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:05,930
What year is this?
Seems like an old fifties sixties or

1570
01:11:05,931 --> 01:11:08,570
something like that and you just die.
Rabies,

1571
01:11:08,571 --> 01:11:10,220
you don't bounce back.
Right and right.

1572
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:13,800
And it's very sad.
You can't hold water in

1573
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:16,650
a,
so you just constantly spit out water.

1574
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,480
Oh Shit,
dude.

1575
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,450
Um,
this is scary stuff,

1576
01:11:23,451 --> 01:11:24,284
man.
He's trying to eat.

1577
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:25,620
Yeah,
it does.

1578
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:27,640
It won't work.
He just puts it in his mouth and it will

1579
01:11:27,641 --> 01:11:28,760
spit it out.
Probably.

1580
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:31,460
What a fucked up disease,
man.

1581
01:11:31,670 --> 01:11:36,670
Rabies is so crazy because it really is
like a Zombie disease for dogs,

1582
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:38,270
right?
Yeah.

1583
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:40,100
For dogs or animals,
they get it.

1584
01:11:40,101 --> 01:11:40,911
They,
oh my God,

1585
01:11:40,911 --> 01:11:43,040
look at me foaming at the mouth.
Yeah.

1586
01:11:43,190 --> 01:11:46,340
Now let me ask you this.
At what point in time to just give this

1587
01:11:46,341 --> 01:11:48,920
guy a lethal dose of morphine and get
this over with right now?

1588
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,470
Like why did they let him get this far
gone?

1589
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:52,970
They're just letting them die on his
own.

1590
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:56,030
What is it about people that want people
to die on their own?

1591
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:58,430
Like there's a certain amount we know
about the human body,

1592
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,680
right?
When he gets to that sort of a stage.

1593
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:02,961
Got It.
I mean,

1594
01:12:02,961 --> 01:12:07,010
the guy's foaming at the mouth,
twitching and bucking while he's

1595
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:07,780
strapped to it.

1596
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:08,620
Bed at.
And.

1597
01:12:08,621 --> 01:12:10,000
T.
There's videos of kids.

1598
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:12,930
It's just like little like,
like three year old kids having rabies

1599
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,800
like,
and you can't do anything.

1600
01:12:14,801 --> 01:12:16,510
Just have to,
they should kill her.

1601
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:18,820
But like it's in,
they do now.

1602
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:22,210
I think they just let him today suffer
today.

1603
01:12:22,211 --> 01:12:23,920
I don't think you're allowed to kill
anybody,

1604
01:12:23,921 --> 01:12:24,670
you know?
No.

1605
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:27,160
I mean I saw him.
I mean if you have rabies,

1606
01:12:27,161 --> 01:12:29,050
do they have a cure?
I think like,

1607
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:31,750
like if as an example,
if you get bit by a raccoon,

1608
01:12:31,751 --> 01:12:34,180
you'd have to go through all those like
a hundred shots.

1609
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:34,841
Right.
You know,

1610
01:12:34,841 --> 01:12:39,070
type thing.
I don't know how long you have til to do

1611
01:12:39,071 --> 01:12:39,904
that.

1612
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:45,260
Anybody that thinks that all
vaccinations are bad is a fucking idiot.

1613
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:53,300
If you really think that it's all some
sort of a big giant conspiracy to ruin

1614
01:12:53,431 --> 01:12:55,680
people and make a ton of money,
you're crazy.

1615
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:58,590
If people getting jacked by
vaccinations,

1616
01:12:58,591 --> 01:13:03,570
that is an unfortunate side effect of
one of the most spectacular things that

1617
01:13:03,571 --> 01:13:06,780
human beings have ever created.
They created a way to combat diseases

1618
01:13:06,781 --> 01:13:11,781
that killed untold millions.
Let me think about the fuck of malaria

1619
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,200
vaccinations.
They can give you malaria shots,

1620
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:19,290
a bunch of different shit they give you
or malaria pills.

1621
01:13:19,291 --> 01:13:23,340
You take pills and then you,
you go over there and you live where

1622
01:13:23,341 --> 01:13:24,810
malaria kills everybody.

1623
01:13:26,590 --> 01:13:27,520
Polio.
I mean,

1624
01:13:27,521 --> 01:13:29,590
they basically wiped out polio.
It did.

1625
01:13:29,591 --> 01:13:32,140
It just recently come back.
Just because people aren't vaccinating

1626
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,060
the kids anymore.
Yeah.

1627
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,220
There's a lot of people that aren't,
uh,

1628
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:37,960
mumps,
measles.

1629
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:40,360
There's a lot of different ones.
They're making their way back.

1630
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:42,670
Yeah.
Mean they figured out,

1631
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:43,990
look,
it's not perfect,

1632
01:13:44,110 --> 01:13:47,800
but there's not a damn thing that
involves putting chemicals in your body.

1633
01:13:47,801 --> 01:13:49,270
That's perfect.
Not a damn thing.

1634
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:53,800
But what they've done with vaccinations
is fucking amazing.

1635
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,770
Now I think I agree with you on flu
shots.

1636
01:13:56,950 --> 01:13:58,610
I don't get flu shots.
Okay.

1637
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:00,460
I never had one.
I don't,

1638
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,910
I don't think that they don't work.
I think they work sometimes,

1639
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:06,790
but I know people that have taken flu
shots and gotten sick.

1640
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:07,231
Okay.
Yeah.

1641
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:09,060
Cause it's the flu and you're not
supposed to.

1642
01:14:09,061 --> 01:14:12,040
But I usually for a couple of days you
might a little sick.

1643
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:13,630
He wants that.
What does this,

1644
01:14:13,730 --> 01:14:15,670
it's the disease express itself in two
forms.

1645
01:14:15,671 --> 01:14:17,240
Furious rabies,
whoa.

1646
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:21,010
70% of human cases cause hyper excited
behavior,

1647
01:14:21,011 --> 01:14:24,700
a strong fear of water and sometimes a
strong fear of flying.

1648
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:29,020
This will eventually result in death by
cardio respiratory arrest,

1649
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:34,240
paralytic rabies.
30% is a less exciting and takes longer

1650
01:14:34,241 --> 01:14:37,240
to kill you with it.
Your muscles gradually paralyzed

1651
01:14:37,241 --> 01:14:39,820
beginning at the source of the infection
spreading outwards.

1652
01:14:39,821 --> 01:14:42,220
What is this article from everything you
want to talk about?

1653
01:14:42,221 --> 01:14:43,450
Rabies cause that Gizmodo.
Yeah.

1654
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:47,500
Wow.
With extreme aggression that most

1655
01:14:47,501 --> 01:14:50,560
strongly characterize the disease when
the animals have it.

1656
01:14:50,561 --> 01:14:52,990
What's fascinating to me is that they
want to bite you,

1657
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:57,940
so which would help spread the disease.
It's almost like the disease uses the

1658
01:14:57,941 --> 01:15:01,750
animal system.
It makes the the animal more likely to

1659
01:15:01,751 --> 01:15:04,570
bite.
Like it's like piloting the animal and

1660
01:15:04,571 --> 01:15:06,550
getting it to attack Zombie.

1661
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:09,460
Yeah.
Have you ever seen the the rat with

1662
01:15:09,461 --> 01:15:13,280
rabies chasing the cat?
I mean think we've talked about stop

1663
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,640
rabies.
The Rad has toxoplasma.

1664
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:17,920
It's a different thing.
It's a different parasite.

1665
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:20,950
Oh yeah.
That's the thing that's super common

1666
01:15:20,951 --> 01:15:25,900
with cats and rats and people get it.
And somewhere around 50 million

1667
01:15:25,901 --> 01:15:28,250
Americans have,
it affects your judgment,

1668
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:31,150
uh,
makes you more impulsive in it.

1669
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:34,510
Um,
there's a direct relationship to people

1670
01:15:34,511 --> 01:15:38,500
or toxoplasma infected and motorcycle
accidents.

1671
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:40,990
Yeah.
They're more likely to get in motorcycle

1672
01:15:40,991 --> 01:15:42,990
accidents.
Robert Sapolsky talked about,

1673
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:44,230
he was on a podcast.
We did.

1674
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:46,420
It's one of my favorite ones,
but it was really quick.

1675
01:15:46,421 --> 01:15:48,340
It was only looking at it for us.
It was like an hour.

1676
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:51,040
And so Paul ski is,
um,

1677
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:56,100
just world renowned for his study of
toxo plasma and what it does to people,

1678
01:15:56,950 --> 01:15:59,080
but it affects the cats.
Um,

1679
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:01,210
well first of all affects the rats.

1680
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:04,540
Um,
sexual reward system hijacks his brain,

1681
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:08,350
gives it a boner to get erect at the
smell of cat urine sometimes.

1682
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,590
Wow.
And it takes away their fear of cats

1683
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:12,680
completely.
So they go wander around cat.

1684
01:16:12,681 --> 01:16:16,990
The cats kill them and then they get
into the cat that way because they can

1685
01:16:16,991 --> 01:16:19,270
only reproduce inside the cat's
digestive system.

1686
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,050
It's crazy.
So these worms get into the cat's body.

1687
01:16:23,051 --> 01:16:25,810
So they can reproduce and then they shit
out.

1688
01:16:25,811 --> 01:16:27,880
Catch it.
People come in contact with the cat

1689
01:16:27,881 --> 01:16:29,800
shit.
Sometimes even through their feet,

1690
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:32,020
through walking around barefoot around
cat shit.

1691
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:35,750
The toxo gets in their system and it
affects the way they behave.

1692
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,970
Some crazy amount of people in the world
habit like at one point in time at

1693
01:16:39,971 --> 01:16:43,330
France it was more than 40% of the
people had it.

1694
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:44,830
Yeah,
it's nuts.

1695
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:47,110
Yeah.
That's what's doing it to that cat.

1696
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:49,450
That was,
there's a lot of those things,

1697
01:16:49,451 --> 01:16:51,490
man.
How about that aquatic worm that makes

1698
01:16:51,730 --> 01:16:55,960
grasshoppers drown themselves,
grows inside a bug's body and then says,

1699
01:16:55,961 --> 01:16:57,610
hey faggot.
Once you go jump in that water,

1700
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:02,250
I will jump in that water and they
jumped in the water and they drown.

1701
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:03,890
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

1702
01:17:03,891 --> 01:17:08,230
They talk this organism and it killing
itself so that they can pop out in the

1703
01:17:08,231 --> 01:17:09,100
water and live.

1704
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:12,950
There's a bunch of things like that in
nature.

1705
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:14,690
We,
you have to wonder like how,

1706
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,840
how did this evolve?
Like what kind of,

1707
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:21,980
what is what's going on?
Like what is the actual process that

1708
01:17:21,981 --> 01:17:26,300
allows something to evolve into a,
like a plant that can eat a rat.

1709
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:30,200
You ever see that plant that gets her
all slippery and smells good?

1710
01:17:30,201 --> 01:17:33,830
So the rats come here and they fall into
the hole and it's into this like this

1711
01:17:33,831 --> 01:17:37,700
looks like a like a two lip,
like a giant thick two lip and it just

1712
01:17:37,701 --> 01:17:40,670
absorbs the rat.
Like how the fuck did that start?

1713
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:43,010
And that's what it does all the time.
I get tricks,

1714
01:17:43,011 --> 01:17:45,640
the rats like what the fuck?
Like what,

1715
01:17:45,641 --> 01:17:48,140
what was stage one?
Like what was that thing like in the

1716
01:17:48,141 --> 01:17:49,460
beginning?
What did it like?

1717
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:52,220
He did it a catch a bug and the bugs are
cool,

1718
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,980
but let's get one of the furry fuckers.
It's always chewing on my leaves,

1719
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:59,920
you know,
does just so many different forms of

1720
01:17:59,921 --> 01:18:02,440
life.
And this is all we know about earth.

1721
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:05,530
Like we were talking about exploring the
ocean.

1722
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:10,990
You imagine if we found some crazy
fucking half human looking things that

1723
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:12,390
live on it.
And I think that,

1724
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:14,670
I told you about this before,
but there's this plant,

1725
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:16,800
it's on planet earth two,
so I'm not really going to show the

1726
01:18:16,801 --> 01:18:19,490
footage,
but it has these seedlings on this

1727
01:18:19,491 --> 01:18:23,520
specific island somewhere that these
birds come and land and they eat the

1728
01:18:23,521 --> 01:18:24,960
seeds,
and then they also,

1729
01:18:24,961 --> 01:18:27,330
if they get stuck to the bird's bodies
and as they fly around,

1730
01:18:27,331 --> 01:18:31,170
that's how it spreads.
But the birds can get them stuck to them

1731
01:18:31,230 --> 01:18:36,230
so much that it gets stuck on the ground
and they can't fly anymore and they end

1732
01:18:36,601 --> 01:18:41,601
up dying and then being decomposed and
the plants sort of like he throws out of

1733
01:18:41,641 --> 01:18:42,630
them.
Yeah.

1734
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:43,870
Yeah.
They're covered in these things,

1735
01:18:43,871 --> 01:18:45,970
like the birds trying to clean the
things off him.

1736
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:47,650
Yeah.
The birds eat them.

1737
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:49,030
Oh look,
he's decomposing.

1738
01:18:49,031 --> 01:18:50,830
Yeah,
and the trees growing out of them.

1739
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:52,360
Fuck,
that's crazy.

1740
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:55,480
That's insane.
The planner to stuff is awesome.

1741
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:57,550
Oh yeah.
Planet Earth and planet earth two are

1742
01:18:57,610 --> 01:18:59,470
both amazing.
Yeah.

1743
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:02,770
I mean when you,
when you see the very bizarre ways that

1744
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:06,610
nature figures out how to,
how to take advantage of a situation.

1745
01:19:06,970 --> 01:19:09,760
My favorite one is that cordyceps
mushroom that grows in those,

1746
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:14,300
um,
those ants and the other ants recognize

1747
01:19:14,301 --> 01:19:17,380
that this is a problem,
that this thing died with these ants.

1748
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:20,650
These ants died with these mushrooms
growing inside of it.

1749
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:25,860
And the spores will build up inside this
thing's body and then explode and spray

1750
01:19:26,081 --> 01:19:27,760
through the air.
And in fact,

1751
01:19:27,790 --> 01:19:30,370
all the other ants around it,
like literally,

1752
01:19:30,371 --> 01:19:31,570
like,
it's like a bomb.

1753
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:33,850
And somehow or another,
the ants know this.

1754
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:37,840
So the ants take the body and they drag
it out of town.

1755
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,550
They're like,
we gotta get 'em out of here before the

1756
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:40,840
poor blows.
I mean,

1757
01:19:40,841 --> 01:19:43,720
it's literally like someone throws the
hangry and your car,

1758
01:19:43,721 --> 01:19:47,050
you just chuck it out just in time.
It's fucking nuts,

1759
01:19:47,051 --> 01:19:47,884
man.

1760
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:51,390
I love shit like that.
It's fucking nuts.

1761
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:53,220
Yeah,
it's fucking nuts.

1762
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,180
I mean,
it really is.

1763
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:56,760
How does it know?
I mean,

1764
01:19:56,761 --> 01:20:00,060
how these Goddamn ants know that they
have to get this thing out of there so

1765
01:20:00,061 --> 01:20:01,410
the thing's dead.
Right.

1766
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:04,200
And then little spores start growing out
of its head.

1767
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:06,750
See the spore grown out of its head.
This is crazy.

1768
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:07,790
That's nuts.
Yeah.

1769
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,800
So the mushrooms grow inside their
bodies,

1770
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:15,840
and I don't know how the ants know this,
but the ants know they got to get that

1771
01:20:15,841 --> 01:20:18,840
fucking thing out of town.
Wow.

1772
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:22,890
And they drag him away.
Maybe it's like a smell.

1773
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:26,040
I mean,
I don't think answer cannibals,

1774
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:29,130
but look how crazy that is.
This thing grows out of its body.

1775
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:34,270
How is that any different than like
the promethium movie or alien movies?

1776
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:38,610
You know?
I mean,

1777
01:20:38,611 --> 01:20:39,510
how was that different?
I mean,

1778
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:43,750
it's really not.
It's some crazy organism that eats its

1779
01:20:43,751 --> 01:20:48,751
host and the ants look mushrooms
mushroom is that thrive off of carbon

1780
01:20:51,631 --> 01:20:55,950
monoxide or some day they're just like
us.

1781
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:58,800
They eat oxygen and breathe carbon
dioxide.

1782
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:00,540
Now here's a thing,
the quarter Zips,

1783
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:03,780
mushrooms that get harvested for things
like on it,

1784
01:21:03,781 --> 01:21:06,780
shroom tech,
the way they harvest those things is off

1785
01:21:06,781 --> 01:21:08,400
caterpillars.
Really?

1786
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:09,383
Yes.

1787
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:11,310
So the,
like this,

1788
01:21:11,390 --> 01:21:12,540
he said it to so that,
that,

1789
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,270
that those mushrooms wouldn't be
psychedelic like it was in when he tried

1790
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:17,310
to take those little ant mushrooms.
No,

1791
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:20,580
they're not psychedelic become some of,
I mean there's a bunch of different

1792
01:21:20,581 --> 01:21:25,410
kinds of quarter subs mushroom,
but what they found is that high

1793
01:21:25,411 --> 01:21:29,250
altitude Yak herders or our cattle
herders think it was cattle.

1794
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:32,280
I forget what it was.
They noticed that when their animals

1795
01:21:32,281 --> 01:21:36,720
were eating these mushrooms,
they were more active and so they

1796
01:21:36,721 --> 01:21:39,300
started feeding their mushrooms,
you know,

1797
01:21:39,301 --> 01:21:42,990
feeding the mushrooms to people and they
had some pretty great results with it

1798
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:46,680
and they started noticing that it helps
people and they did some studies on it.

1799
01:21:46,681 --> 01:21:48,180
There's,
you can go to on it and you could read

1800
01:21:48,181 --> 01:21:52,170
the studies on cordyceps mushrooms or
just google it independently.

1801
01:21:52,290 --> 01:21:54,120
There's some interesting studies.
The Chinese,

1802
01:21:54,990 --> 01:21:56,490
see that's a little tricky though.

1803
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:59,850
They say that Chinese Olympic team used
him and they want a bunch of metals.

1804
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:04,560
Here's what's tricky about that.
It's entirely likely that they said,

1805
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:06,780
oh yeah,
we were only using them mushrooms.

1806
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,270
Definitely no steroids.
You know,

1807
01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:12,840
I mean,
in the interest of full disclosure,

1808
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,430
you know,
we're in a fucking onnit tee shirt,

1809
01:22:14,690 --> 01:22:15,523
right,
right.

1810
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:19,740
It's entirely possible.
They were doing steroids to most likely

1811
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:22,350
that they were doing steroids.
Did you see [inaudible] and you see

1812
01:22:22,351 --> 01:22:24,780
they're moving?
I think they're all doing steroids.

1813
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:29,220
I think like especially all those
communist countries that rely so heavily

1814
01:22:29,221 --> 01:22:32,000
on propaganda like Russia,
like Russia has been doing state.

1815
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:36,500
They had a state sponsored drug program
100% it's all documented in that,

1816
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:37,770
that Mo,
that movie.

1817
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:41,580
So when China says that they want these
track and field metals because they were

1818
01:22:41,581 --> 01:22:44,430
taking this quarter steps mushroom,
I bet it helped,

1819
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:45,570
but it helped.

1820
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:46,890
I take it,
but guess what?

1821
01:22:46,891 --> 01:22:49,440
It doesn't feel like a steroid.
When I take shroom tech,

1822
01:22:49,441 --> 01:22:51,570
it's like a nice little boost.
They get a little boost,

1823
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,010
just a little bit,
not speedy,

1824
01:22:53,011 --> 01:22:55,110
but a little boost.
I definitely feel an extra gear,

1825
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:57,420
but it ain't like I'm not,
you know,

1826
01:22:57,780 --> 01:23:00,510
there's some else other shit too.
Those guys were doing,

1827
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,000
they fucking do everything they can,
man.

1828
01:23:03,001 --> 01:23:06,040
Anything they can get away with whatever
the they can get away with.

1829
01:23:06,041 --> 01:23:08,260
They do and they're not testing them all
the time.

1830
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:10,000
They're just not.
If there are,

1831
01:23:10,001 --> 01:23:11,770
they're hiding shit.
People get busted.

1832
01:23:11,771 --> 01:23:14,260
They've already proven that people get
busted and they let them slide.

1833
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:16,270
You know,
there's a lot of influence peddling.

1834
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,990
I mean,
maybe it would be less now because

1835
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:22,720
Russia wasn't even allowed to compete
now that people had to compete under the

1836
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:25,900
Olympic flag.
That certain athletes brush is so crazy.

1837
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:27,790
You see that?
Do they killed in England?

1838
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:29,590
The nerve gas?
Is he dead yet?

1839
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:33,670
Does him and his daughter or something
like that or his wife?

1840
01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:36,280
The killed him in England with nerve
gas.

1841
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:38,090
Really?
Well,

1842
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:39,790
if he's not dead,
he might as well be dead.

1843
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:42,850
He's on his way to dead.
He's incredibly horrible critical

1844
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:44,890
condition.
It's just like,

1845
01:23:44,891 --> 01:23:48,190
this is some spy versus spy shit and
this is some really,

1846
01:23:48,191 --> 01:23:51,160
it's like some movie shit.
They're killing them with nerve gas.

1847
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:52,720
They're killing,
you know,

1848
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:55,930
he,
I think he was like a double agent or

1849
01:23:55,931 --> 01:23:58,330
something.
Is that what he was supposedly Russia's

1850
01:23:58,331 --> 01:24:00,730
now hacking our power grades.
Oh No.

1851
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:04,690
Like I guess he didn't die.
Nathan.

1852
01:24:04,730 --> 01:24:07,180
If,
if it was a Russian military grade

1853
01:24:07,181 --> 01:24:08,620
agent,
he would have died on the spot,

1854
01:24:08,621 --> 01:24:10,210
obviously.
Is what Putin said.

1855
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:11,950
Oh,
that's what Putin said.

1856
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:14,830
Fuck cut.
We should definitely listen to him

1857
01:24:14,831 --> 01:24:15,664
always.

1858
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:20,380
What is a remainer chronic critical
condition?

1859
01:24:20,410 --> 01:24:22,360
What did pull up a story on him?
Who is he and why?

1860
01:24:22,361 --> 01:24:25,630
Why are they trying to whack this dude,
he's in critical condition.

1861
01:24:26,890 --> 01:24:27,430
Well,
hold up.

1862
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:28,600
Go Up.
Scroll up.

1863
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:33,730
Putin calls Russian poisoned x by
nonsense and delirium.

1864
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,710
Oh,
well then they definitely did it make

1865
01:24:35,711 --> 01:24:37,770
that bigger,
uh,

1866
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:42,810
sloughed off the notion that Russia was
behind the poisoning former Russian spy

1867
01:24:43,121 --> 01:24:46,600
and his daughter saying any sensible
person would understand that this is

1868
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:50,320
delirium and nonsense.
It is unthinkable that we would do such

1869
01:24:50,321 --> 01:24:53,380
a thing.
The first thing that came to mind,

1870
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:58,060
if it was a military grade agent,
he would have died on the spot on.

1871
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:00,970
They would have died on the spot.
Obviously said Putin speaking in the

1872
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:04,600
party headquarters in Moscow shortly
after he spoke to a crowd and central

1873
01:25:04,601 --> 01:25:06,940
Moscow.
Russia does not have any such agents.

1874
01:25:06,941 --> 01:25:10,390
We destroyed it all.
Okay.

1875
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:11,680
I don't believe that

1876
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:15,560
it puts an asa says he's never met trump
before the election.

1877
01:25:15,561 --> 01:25:18,410
And then there's like video from like
three years ago,

1878
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:20,090
trump saying guy,
I met Putin,

1879
01:25:20,091 --> 01:25:20,924
you know,
and like,

1880
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:21,651
Oh really?
Yeah.

1881
01:25:21,651 --> 01:25:22,484
It's just like,

1882
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:23,540
oh,
bullshit.

1883
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:27,140
Everything's bullshit.
It's a fun time though.

1884
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,060
I hate it.
I think this is a fun time.

1885
01:25:29,061 --> 01:25:30,650
You like this?
I'm okay.

1886
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:36,580
I'm enjoying it because I think this is
what's fun about this time is,

1887
01:25:37,041 --> 01:25:40,370
um,
even with like in this is partly because

1888
01:25:40,371 --> 01:25:45,020
we have a guy like trump in office is
that everything seems like there's

1889
01:25:45,021 --> 01:25:47,630
nobody at the wheel.
Everything from top to bottom,

1890
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:51,590
ms people scrambling and take the wheel.
I'll take the wheel and right the ship,

1891
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:54,710
but there's no one at the wheel.
It's all craziness right now.

1892
01:25:54,711 --> 01:25:56,030
It's crazy.
And it's culturally,

1893
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:58,280
it's craziness.
Politically.

1894
01:25:58,970 --> 01:26:02,300
It's craziness economically.
Like none of it makes any sense.

1895
01:26:02,301 --> 01:26:04,010
It's racially,
I mean,

1896
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:06,170
people are fighting,
people are mad at Bruno Mars,

1897
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:08,810
Bruno,
Bruno Mars or cultural appropriation.

1898
01:26:08,811 --> 01:26:09,740
How's that possible?
I mean,

1899
01:26:09,741 --> 01:26:12,020
there's so many different things that
are happening today that are so

1900
01:26:12,021 --> 01:26:13,190
outrageous.
Oh,

1901
01:26:13,191 --> 01:26:15,290
how about this one?
A guy got fucking,

1902
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:18,290
uh,
sentenced or he got convicted and will

1903
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:21,620
be sent in soon.
I think he gets sentenced in April for,

1904
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:25,010
uh,
getting his dog to make a Hitler salute.

1905
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:27,710
Making a video.
Yes.

1906
01:26:27,711 --> 01:26:28,760
It's on my,
uh,

1907
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:30,230
my twitter page.
I retweeted it.

1908
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:34,790
The guy is in Scotland and he's a proud
shit poster.

1909
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:37,460
He's one of those guys,
Jamie loves ship posters.

1910
01:26:37,490 --> 01:26:39,880
It's one of his favorite things,
you know.

1911
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:42,470
Um,
but he's one of those guys that just,

1912
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:45,860
he posts stupid shit to get a reaction
from people.

1913
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:50,300
And so just to piss his girlfriend off,
he decided he'd tried to get his dog to

1914
01:26:50,301 --> 01:26:53,060
do the Hitler salute,
the Nazi salute.

1915
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:54,560
And uh,
you know,

1916
01:26:54,561 --> 01:26:57,470
he,
he gets his dog to do it on this video

1917
01:26:57,620 --> 01:27:00,860
and he says gas the Jews apparently,
you know,

1918
01:27:00,861 --> 01:27:04,850
like trying to like get his dog to do
this.

1919
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:05,960
Like when he,
I guess,

1920
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:07,580
you know,
he thought it was funny.

1921
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:11,960
Then he puts it on youtube.
Not only does it get him in trouble,

1922
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:14,090
which I get people being mad like,
hey,

1923
01:27:14,091 --> 01:27:15,140
that's insensitive.
Okay,

1924
01:27:15,141 --> 01:27:17,090
whatever.
It's what he's trying to be insensitive.

1925
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:21,740
They fucking arrested him.
They tried him and they convicted him.

1926
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,420
Which country?
Scotland.

1927
01:27:24,830 --> 01:27:26,690
The UK.
I mean,

1928
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,750
this guy's convicted and now he'll be
sentenced.

1929
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:31,670
Wow.
It's fucking crazy.

1930
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:34,160
If you've seen the video [inaudible]
Jamie,

1931
01:27:34,161 --> 01:27:36,830
pull up that video because it's crazy to
watch.

1932
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:41,380
It's not that big a deal thing has been
pushed off up until April time.

1933
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:42,214
Yet next month.
Yeah,

1934
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:44,930
that's what I said.
What is the pull up the video.

1935
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:48,140
Yeah,
he's um,

1936
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,360
that's one thing about United States,
man.

1937
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:53,120
You forget about free speech.
Like I was talking to somebody from a

1938
01:27:53,121 --> 01:27:54,200
different country recently.
He goes,

1939
01:27:54,201 --> 01:27:58,520
you have no idea how big that is.
And we kind of take it for granted.

1940
01:27:58,550 --> 01:27:59,870
Giant.
Giant.

1941
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:00,300
Yeah.

1942
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:02,850
It's giant and it's,
it's everything.

1943
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:06,300
Okay.
It has been identified by Youtube

1944
01:28:06,301 --> 01:28:09,360
community is inappropriate and offensive
to some audiences.

1945
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:11,970
I understand.
Please proceed.

1946
01:28:12,110 --> 01:28:12,943
Give me some volume.

1947
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:18,550
And so I'll throw out,
I'll be calling them.

1948
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,970
And Evie least cute thing that I could
think of.

1949
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,540
Oh,
you can't even understand a word.

1950
01:28:22,541 --> 01:28:24,940
He says.
Why don't they just speak English?

1951
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:30,490
God Gas the Jews,
the Jews were more gassy juice.

1952
01:28:30,491 --> 01:28:34,110
So you always asked the juice.
[inaudible] juice.

1953
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:36,580
[inaudible] juice,
the juice,

1954
01:28:38,370 --> 01:28:41,670
the juice.
So He's,

1955
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:44,560
it took them forever to teach this dog
this.

1956
01:28:44,561 --> 01:28:45,510
Is this the idea?
Yeah.

1957
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:47,440
That's where we're watching this over
and over again.

1958
01:28:51,390 --> 01:28:52,650
Oh God,
Gosh.

1959
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:56,610
Cio.
Oh Wow.

1960
01:28:56,611 --> 01:28:58,650
Boy,
he's adorable.

1961
01:28:58,970 --> 01:29:01,800
It is very cute.
He taught the to do that.

1962
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:04,870
It's crazy,
man.

1963
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:07,040
It sucks that he's getting,
well,

1964
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:10,820
it's a classic shit post video.
Yeah.

1965
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:14,430
It's like these guys.
This is the whole pepe,

1966
01:29:14,431 --> 01:29:16,590
the frog thing.
You can take it down.

1967
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:19,230
This is the whole,
it's all the same shit.

1968
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:21,840
It's a bunch of people that are having
fun sang shit.

1969
01:29:21,841 --> 01:29:24,630
That's totally inappropriate.
This is what it is.

1970
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:26,790
That's what that is.
It's the same thing.

1971
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,460
And the people that think that,
like anybody who would do that is a

1972
01:29:29,461 --> 01:29:31,770
Nazi.
You're not correct.

1973
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:35,040
That's not true.
I guarantee you the guys not a Nazi,

1974
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,200
I think.
I don't know.

1975
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:40,410
I'm assuming he's not a Nazi.
I'm assuming he's a shit poster.

1976
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:43,530
He's a guy who's trying to be funny.
I hundred percent.

1977
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:44,820
That's just ignorance.
Yeah,

1978
01:29:44,821 --> 01:29:47,070
and that funniness is funny to them.

1979
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:48,120
See,
here's the thing.

1980
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:50,640
You might not like it.
You might think it's,

1981
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:52,590
it's horribly and offensive,
but here's the thing.

1982
01:29:52,591 --> 01:29:57,591
No Jews got an ma got gassed during the
making of that video and the worst thing

1983
01:29:58,411 --> 01:30:03,270
it did is get racist to laugh.
The best thing it did is get people to

1984
01:30:03,271 --> 01:30:06,120
talk about what's appropriate.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1985
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:08,580
I mean it's not good.
I mean I don't like it.

1986
01:30:08,610 --> 01:30:10,320
I wouldn't do it.
I wouldn't tell people,

1987
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:12,480
hey this is the most awesome video ever.
Come watch it.

1988
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:16,440
But to put that guy,
not only to put him on trial but the

1989
01:30:16,441 --> 01:30:19,980
fucking convict him and Scotland,
how dare you,

1990
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:22,110
you people are supposed to be ahead of
the curve.

1991
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:24,600
Skyland supposed to be a pretty fucking
bad ass place.

1992
01:30:25,650 --> 01:30:27,790
That's ridiculous.
Isn't Scotland though?

1993
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:31,980
Like the like the like a place that you,
I think it's Scotland where you can't

1994
01:30:31,981 --> 01:30:33,630
even talk about sex on stage.

1995
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:36,990
You can cuss,
you can like show you pull a tid out.

1996
01:30:36,991 --> 01:30:39,090
But like if you're talking to,
to talk about sex,

1997
01:30:39,091 --> 01:30:41,490
I think it's Scotland.
There's a noble cause.

1998
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:45,480
Billy Connolly's from Scotland to Billy
Connolly's a pretty famous worldwide

1999
01:30:45,481 --> 01:30:46,610
comedian.
I think it sweet.

2000
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:48,960
It's pretty outrageous guy.
I might be thinking to Sweden.

2001
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:51,240
Yeah,
Co Cause Connolly's pretty,

2002
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:56,190
he's,
he's like in the line of like popular

2003
01:30:56,191 --> 01:31:00,780
American standup comics of his era.
He was a very respected guy and he's

2004
01:31:00,781 --> 01:31:02,020
from Scotland.
It must be.

2005
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:04,800
So I think I'm thinking of Sweden maybe.
I don't know.

2006
01:31:04,890 --> 01:31:07,500
I don't know Jack Shit about those other
countries that I only visit

2007
01:31:07,501 --> 01:31:08,370
occasionally.
Right.

2008
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:09,270
But,
but when you go to,

2009
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:11,130
when you go to these countries to do
comedy,

2010
01:31:11,131 --> 01:31:12,480
do you ever have to be like,
Hey,

2011
01:31:12,481 --> 01:31:13,950
don't talk about,
no,

2012
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:17,520
I wouldn't go if I went to a place they
told me I couldn't talk about something,

2013
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:18,960
I'd be like,
well why would I go there?

2014
01:31:18,970 --> 01:31:19,890
All right,
well I'll just go somewhere,

2015
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:22,470
work and talk about anything.
I don't want to go somewhere where only

2016
01:31:22,471 --> 01:31:24,780
talk about certain things.
So like I,

2017
01:31:24,781 --> 01:31:26,760
I've done a few,
uh,

2018
01:31:26,790 --> 01:31:30,570
air quote clean shows in my day where I
got a Gig,

2019
01:31:30,571 --> 01:31:31,950
especially when I was first starting
out.

2020
01:31:31,951 --> 01:31:32,341
They're like,
Hey,

2021
01:31:32,341 --> 01:31:34,980
can you do a half an hour clean?
And I go,

2022
01:31:34,981 --> 01:31:35,850
okay.
Yeah.

2023
01:31:35,851 --> 01:31:38,220
And I would just edit.
I'll just edit the shit out of

2024
01:31:38,221 --> 01:31:40,170
something.
Use words that you know,

2025
01:31:40,430 --> 01:31:44,760
there's like Innuendo that you could get
away with and I could sort of squeak by

2026
01:31:44,761 --> 01:31:46,740
with a bullshit half hour set,
you know?

2027
01:31:47,610 --> 01:31:50,180
But I would never do that today.
Like I don't want to,

2028
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:53,190
I don't want to,
it's just like what I want to be able to

2029
01:31:53,191 --> 01:31:58,191
do is find out what's the best way to
express the thoughts that are in my mind

2030
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:02,050
that are funny.
Does the best way is never by censoring

2031
01:32:02,051 --> 01:32:02,770
yourself.

2032
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:05,800
The best way is by figuring out what's
the best way to express yourself.

2033
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:08,710
Sometimes censorship can be a tool
though for writing.

2034
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:11,590
Like if you know that you can't swear or
you know,

2035
01:32:11,710 --> 01:32:12,910
like for joke writing,
one of the,

2036
01:32:12,911 --> 01:32:17,911
one of the cool things about twitter was
that you had 140 characters.

2037
01:32:17,951 --> 01:32:22,951
Now obviously you have more of to 80 but
the one 40 made you write a joke very

2038
01:32:23,711 --> 01:32:25,480
concisely.
If you want it to be funny,

2039
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:27,910
you know,
you'd have to have set up punchline cut

2040
01:32:27,911 --> 01:32:28,451
out all that.
You're like,

2041
01:32:28,451 --> 01:32:30,790
Oh,
I'm 10 10 letters over shit.

2042
01:32:30,970 --> 01:32:33,040
And you back it up a little.
Oh just take this out.

2043
01:32:33,041 --> 01:32:36,550
And I could say in one word,
it makes you understand that the economy

2044
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:39,340
of words better.
And sometimes that's the case with

2045
01:32:39,341 --> 01:32:42,160
writing too.
Like you can get out of a joke easy by

2046
01:32:42,161 --> 01:32:46,060
just adding swear words or adding sexual
innuendo or stuff like that.

2047
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:49,540
But that doesn't,
but that,

2048
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:53,500
that's like just an exercise.
Like when you're actually expressing

2049
01:32:53,501 --> 01:32:55,450
yourself,
when you're actually doing the work,

2050
01:32:55,451 --> 01:32:56,950
like going on stage,
doing a show,

2051
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:59,560
you should be able to do whatever the
fuck you want.

2052
01:32:59,561 --> 01:33:03,400
Otherwise it's not stand up and it's
either funny or it's not funny.

2053
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:05,950
I mean it's not funny.
You just weren't funny.

2054
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:10,240
But it's not because it's the subject
matter that's just fucking stupid.

2055
01:33:10,450 --> 01:33:12,970
That's stupid.
Cause anything can be almost anything

2056
01:33:12,971 --> 01:33:15,520
can be funny.
And I'm sure there's probably a few

2057
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:18,130
things that can't be,
but for the most part,

2058
01:33:18,131 --> 01:33:20,170
if you think it's funny,
if you have a point,

2059
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:21,573
it's possible.

2060
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:23,640
Did you see what happened with Hannibal
the other day?

2061
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:24,930
Another thing.
Yeah.

2062
01:33:24,931 --> 01:33:25,351
He,
uh,

2063
01:33:25,351 --> 01:33:30,351
when he got a Gig at Loyola Chicago and
they cut his mic after he supposedly

2064
01:33:31,860 --> 01:33:34,230
said some stuff that they mutually
agreed he shouldn't say,

2065
01:33:34,231 --> 01:33:38,700
but what he put the email up on a
projector I guess and was making jokes

2066
01:33:38,701 --> 01:33:39,750
about the Catholic church.

2067
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:45,230
Hannibal burress sex standup set is
interrupted at Layola after his sex

2068
01:33:45,231 --> 01:33:46,100
abuse joke

2069
01:33:47,010 --> 01:33:49,510
and it cut his mic and then everyone
started booing.

2070
01:33:49,511 --> 01:33:52,120
Everyone was laughing apparently.
And all the kids are saying,

2071
01:33:52,121 --> 01:33:53,320
I'm like,
they should have known what they were

2072
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:55,060
getting themselves into basically.

2073
01:33:55,690 --> 01:33:57,160
Well,
you can't do colleges,

2074
01:33:57,161 --> 01:33:59,290
man.
I've been telling people you can't do

2075
01:33:59,291 --> 01:34:01,930
colleges.
It's not worth it.

2076
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:05,080
It's not worth it.
It's a lot of money though.

2077
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,630
That's the thing.
College is we'll pay you some serious

2078
01:34:07,631 --> 01:34:10,210
cash.
When I was coming up in the early days,

2079
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:13,270
um,
I did one of those knacker conferences

2080
01:34:13,330 --> 01:34:17,050
and if you like National Association for
College Campus Activities,

2081
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:20,080
I think it is.
And if you get booked by a bunch of

2082
01:34:20,081 --> 01:34:23,260
schools Tude it is amazing.
It's amazing.

2083
01:34:23,261 --> 01:34:25,660
You make thousands of dollars.
It was great.

2084
01:34:25,930 --> 01:34:28,180
Like I'm,
that was the first time I made good

2085
01:34:28,181 --> 01:34:30,670
money.
I would travel and go to all these

2086
01:34:30,671 --> 01:34:35,020
different weird like fucking Olivet
Michigan,

2087
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:38,260
some university there and some weird
university in the middle of nowhere in

2088
01:34:38,261 --> 01:34:40,420
Ohio.
And they take you out to some local

2089
01:34:40,421 --> 01:34:43,020
fucking country bar afterwards.
You're doing shots with kids,

2090
01:34:43,030 --> 01:34:47,230
go to school there because I was
basically their age or a couple of years

2091
01:34:47,230 --> 01:34:47,380
older.

2092
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:51,640
This is when I was like 23 or 24 may me,
you know,

2093
01:34:51,641 --> 01:34:54,820
and they were all like 20 so we're all
like in the same wheelhouse.

2094
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:57,380
And then there people that work at the
school that were older,

2095
01:34:57,381 --> 01:34:59,630
they come out drink and when you two
different times fan,

2096
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:05,060
but you could make real money like you
do a Gig and you'd make $1,000 or $1,500

2097
01:35:05,061 --> 01:35:10,010
or $2,000 like holy shit for one show is
crazy for an unknown comedian.

2098
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:14,120
So everybody like aspired to do those
college gigs.

2099
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:18,560
But back then man,
even back then they were real sensitive.

2100
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:21,410
Kids are real sensitive and they're
always looking to,

2101
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:23,840
they don't have a lot of life experience
right.

2102
01:35:24,110 --> 01:35:26,660
So their life experience is limited to
18 years.

2103
01:35:26,661 --> 01:35:29,720
Most of it's been under the care of
their parents for most kids.

2104
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:33,230
And then all of a sudden they're at
school and they're flexing their wings

2105
01:35:33,231 --> 01:35:37,070
and their muscles and you know the,
the objective things and they've decided

2106
01:35:37,071 --> 01:35:39,530
that these things are inappropriate and
these things shouldn't be said.

2107
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:42,250
And this isn't true.
They can't take certain,

2108
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:45,620
they can't take a lot of sarcasm.
They don't know.

2109
01:35:45,650 --> 01:35:46,210
I mean they,
they,

2110
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:50,840
they take you literally too often they
think some subjects or just period taboo

2111
01:35:50,841 --> 01:35:55,760
because they are period taboo in offices
and in some schools and there's some

2112
01:35:55,761 --> 01:35:57,920
things they can't say.
So if they can't say they don't want you

2113
01:35:57,921 --> 01:36:00,410
to say it,
it's a very weird time for kids.

2114
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:03,890
You know?
That's why it's so crazy that you have

2115
01:36:03,891 --> 01:36:08,750
all these fucking dorks that are stuck
in that system,

2116
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:12,050
that graduated from college,
then started teaching and have these

2117
01:36:12,051 --> 01:36:16,850
ridiculous Marxist ideas and loony
fucking left wing ideologies and they're

2118
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:22,120
brainwashing these kids about gender
neutral or gender fluidity and making

2119
01:36:22,401 --> 01:36:26,720
safe spaces and all this stupid shit.
Like what what you're doing is,

2120
01:36:26,721 --> 01:36:31,040
is like further cushioning and coddling
them and then they're just what,

2121
01:36:31,050 --> 01:36:31,760
uh,
what are they gonna do?

2122
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:34,130
They're gonna just gonna join academia
as well.

2123
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:36,530
They're going to get through their
schooling and then teach in this weird

2124
01:36:36,531 --> 01:36:39,170
insulated little thought bubble that you
guys have created.

2125
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:44,030
So when people look at these people
screaming and yelling and calling people

2126
01:36:44,031 --> 01:36:47,660
Nazis and on school campuses and all
this fucking chaos that's going on,

2127
01:36:47,870 --> 01:36:50,990
this is what happens.
This is what happens when you baby

2128
01:36:50,991 --> 01:36:52,980
people.
This is what happens when you,

2129
01:36:52,981 --> 01:36:57,890
you set up this environment where they
can never ever interface with the real

2130
01:36:57,891 --> 01:37:00,440
world.
They just exist in this super

2131
01:37:00,441 --> 01:37:03,740
hypersensitive,
hyper progressive bubble where nothing

2132
01:37:03,741 --> 01:37:05,780
is produced.
Nothing is created.

2133
01:37:05,930 --> 01:37:09,590
You just teaching people ideas and
you're teaching people ideas and the

2134
01:37:09,591 --> 01:37:13,430
ideas are being,
they're being promoted by a person who

2135
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:17,810
in a lot of situations has never even
been out in the real world working like

2136
01:37:17,811 --> 01:37:20,630
there.
It's a bullshit fucking thing.

2137
01:37:20,631 --> 01:37:22,850
And then they have tenure so they can
never be fired.

2138
01:37:25,030 --> 01:37:26,330
Whew.
It's crazy.

2139
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:29,630
Nerfing it's fascinating.
It's pretty fascinating.

2140
01:37:29,631 --> 01:37:31,190
No,
you know that this,

2141
01:37:31,191 --> 01:37:32,300
this,
these are these.

2142
01:37:32,450 --> 01:37:37,060
They're in a lot of ways it's kind of
like royalty and a lot of ways it's kind

2143
01:37:37,061 --> 01:37:39,200
of like,
like weird political systems that get

2144
01:37:39,201 --> 01:37:40,550
corrupt,
like things,

2145
01:37:40,551 --> 01:37:43,580
ideas get corrupt as much as like
finances get corrupt.

2146
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:48,970
Like people feel a way to extract social
points for by promoting their ideas and

2147
01:37:50,151 --> 01:37:52,490
by,
by forcing their ideas down other

2148
01:37:52,491 --> 01:37:55,040
people's throats and having them accept
it and mimic that as well.

2149
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:58,530
And also reinforce it that they're doing
their life right and everybody else is

2150
01:37:58,531 --> 01:38:01,410
doing their live wrong.
So it becomes this weird psychological

2151
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:04,410
wrestling match that people are doing
with people.

2152
01:38:04,780 --> 01:38:06,150
You know,
in the outside world.

2153
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:07,071
I mean,
I've,

2154
01:38:07,071 --> 01:38:09,060
I've,
I've had a lot of guests on to talk

2155
01:38:09,061 --> 01:38:11,190
about this subject,
but I think this subject,

2156
01:38:12,330 --> 01:38:16,020
it's one of the reasons why it rings
true to people is because I think we all

2157
01:38:16,021 --> 01:38:18,960
realize this is happening in just in
life in general,

2158
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:23,220
and there's a lot of weird control
battles going on in life in general.

2159
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:28,440
And in telling a guy that he can't have
his dog say,

2160
01:38:28,441 --> 01:38:30,780
see,
I can't say sieg heil his dog and his

2161
01:38:30,781 --> 01:38:33,600
dog lift his arm up,
telling you the guy that he can't do

2162
01:38:33,601 --> 01:38:35,820
that.
It's just stupid because you're,

2163
01:38:35,821 --> 01:38:38,130
you're making it a way bigger thing that
it should be.

2164
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:40,710
It should be a stupid video that no one
cares about.

2165
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:42,360
I mean,
it's still up on youtube.

2166
01:38:42,361 --> 01:38:47,160
So that shows you how stupid it is.
Yanked Shit left and right.

2167
01:38:47,610 --> 01:38:50,940
Like what?
You see what youtube did to a crowder

2168
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:52,770
when Steven crowder went to this,
uh,

2169
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:57,800
they went to a Lbgtq,
a event in Austin and he had a dude show

2170
01:39:00,211 --> 01:39:04,590
up and saying that he identifies as a
robot and he says all this really rude

2171
01:39:04,591 --> 01:39:05,560
shit.
Twitter,

2172
01:39:05,561 --> 01:39:06,720
it got him in trouble now.
Youtube,

2173
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:09,300
youtube was youtube.
Still have it up.

2174
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:10,710
I thought they put it up there.

2175
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:13,080
I thought it was dee dee monetized or
twitter.

2176
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:15,960
Bandom yeah,
but I thought Youtube bandom as well.

2177
01:39:16,110 --> 01:39:18,420
Facebook bandom no,
someone has to.

2178
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:22,290
Someone else did too.
It might be youtube check.

2179
01:39:23,010 --> 01:39:25,800
Either way.
Um,

2180
01:39:26,610 --> 01:39:29,730
people are trying to control what people
do and don't say.

2181
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:32,430
And I think when you do that,
you run into real problems.

2182
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:34,950
Like who the fuck are you?
Who are you,

2183
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:38,160
who you to decide,
you know,

2184
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:43,290
and even know Noam Chomsky said
something about Sam Harrison,

2185
01:39:43,770 --> 01:39:48,770
Jordan Peterson that uh,
free speech does not impro does not

2186
01:39:49,021 --> 01:39:51,300
apply to hate speech.
Like why?

2187
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:54,090
It's like,
yes it does.

2188
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:55,410
Yes,
it does.

2189
01:39:55,470 --> 01:39:59,550
That's crazy that someone who's really
smart can say it doesn't.

2190
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:00,301
Yeah.
Okay.

2191
01:40:00,301 --> 01:40:02,540
So it's available on Youtube.
Um,

2192
01:40:03,210 --> 01:40:06,600
he say he puts some posting saying that
he was blocked from something.

2193
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:10,680
Doesn't matter.
The point is,

2194
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:16,260
one thing that's been shown is that
they're trying to silence more.

2195
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:21,320
They're trying to stop the spread of
conservative ideology and spread liberal

2196
01:40:22,771 --> 01:40:25,380
ideology.
Like they're actively trying to do that.

2197
01:40:25,710 --> 01:40:30,710
I feel like there's a real worry that
when you have a platform,

2198
01:40:32,131 --> 01:40:33,690
whether it's youtube or something like
that,

2199
01:40:34,830 --> 01:40:38,340
that you could get infected,
but like say shit posters,

2200
01:40:38,341 --> 01:40:40,230
if ship posters just,
they're more,

2201
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:43,050
they're more prolific right there.
Like,

2202
01:40:43,051 --> 01:40:44,970
if you look,
just look at the comments on Youtube,

2203
01:40:45,370 --> 01:40:48,690
like in a lot of like really popular
things that comments are horrific,

2204
01:40:49,170 --> 01:40:53,740
like way disproportionate to how they
would be in the real world.

2205
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:57,430
Like the comments and the p,
the anger that you find in a lot of

2206
01:40:57,431 --> 01:40:59,050
youtube videos,
especially if you look at like the

2207
01:40:59,051 --> 01:41:01,540
comments of podcasts.
Holy Shit Dude.

2208
01:41:01,541 --> 01:41:03,060
People are opinionated,
right?

2209
01:41:03,070 --> 01:41:05,060
They've got some crazy wild fucking
opinion.

2210
01:41:05,130 --> 01:41:06,070
Now,
if you were youtube,

2211
01:41:06,071 --> 01:41:09,100
you'd be like,
we have to figure out a way to stop

2212
01:41:09,310 --> 01:41:12,790
people from saying Faggot or we have to
figure out a way to stop people from

2213
01:41:12,791 --> 01:41:15,040
doing this or stop people from,
uh,

2214
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:16,750
from being homophobic.

2215
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:19,330
We have to figure out a way to stop
people from supporting trump.

2216
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:22,780
We have to figure out a way to stop
people from talking about the wall.

2217
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:26,170
You have to figure out a way and as soon
as you start doing that kind of stuff,

2218
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:30,600
you run into a real slippery when you're
deciding what people shouldn't,

2219
01:41:30,610 --> 01:41:32,800
shouldn't be able to say,
even if it's legal.

2220
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:36,400
That gets real weird because then you
don't have a free speech platform.

2221
01:41:36,401 --> 01:41:40,360
You have a left wing platform like your,
your platform has now left wing,

2222
01:41:40,361 --> 01:41:43,030
and I'm not saying you're wrong,
but I'm saying it,

2223
01:41:43,110 --> 01:41:48,100
it strengthens the position of the
people that you oppose because they are

2224
01:41:48,101 --> 01:41:49,570
being suppressed.
Like you could see there being

2225
01:41:49,571 --> 01:41:51,640
suppressed.
Even if they're wrong,

2226
01:41:52,030 --> 01:41:54,490
you put a guy in jail because his dog
says,

2227
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:58,280
listen Paul,
when he says see high like boy you,

2228
01:41:58,281 --> 01:42:03,280
you just looked real fucking stupid to
most people and now the fight is on and

2229
01:42:03,281 --> 01:42:07,180
now it's going to be this swarm of
controversy where people are freaking,

2230
01:42:07,181 --> 01:42:08,560
I just found out about it yesterday.

2231
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:12,170
I just found out about it last night I
think might not even,

2232
01:42:12,171 --> 01:42:13,570
it might might've been this morning when
I woke up.

2233
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:16,690
Youtube has reported,
did you care about your kids?

2234
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:20,020
Because what this famous conspiracy
theorists,

2235
01:42:20,290 --> 01:42:24,910
his videos have been coming up in the
youtube kids app teaching like flat

2236
01:42:24,911 --> 01:42:26,880
earth Type Shit and like we didn't get
it.

2237
01:42:26,881 --> 01:42:30,760
The planet or moon good stuff.
Yeah,

2238
01:42:30,860 --> 01:42:33,480
a good mood.
Getting into a lot of where they can,

2239
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:34,930
Whoa,
this is too much.

2240
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:37,360
Here's the thing about youtube,
now,

2241
01:42:37,361 --> 01:42:40,570
this is in defense of them,
because I'd talked though I had dinner

2242
01:42:40,571 --> 01:42:44,440
with some big wigs at Youtube and there
was some of the stuff they said was very

2243
01:42:44,441 --> 01:42:48,700
annoying and not recalling things,
hate speech that just weren't like,

2244
01:42:48,701 --> 01:42:51,610
I'm talking about someone who got a
community guideline strike because they

2245
01:42:51,611 --> 01:42:53,620
put a cup,
put a conversation up in their playlist

2246
01:42:54,010 --> 01:42:59,010
between Sam Harris and um,
Douglas Murray to intellectuals and

2247
01:43:01,061 --> 01:43:01,281
they,
they,

2248
01:43:01,281 --> 01:43:03,580
they said that it was because it was
hate speech and I was like,

2249
01:43:03,581 --> 01:43:05,380
that is the fact.
They could just say,

2250
01:43:05,381 --> 01:43:09,670
that just drove me nuts.
But they're dealing with who knows how

2251
01:43:09,671 --> 01:43:11,140
many videos every day.
I mean,

2252
01:43:11,141 --> 01:43:12,460
it's insane.
How could they,

2253
01:43:12,940 --> 01:43:14,890
how could they possibly even know the
videos?

2254
01:43:15,130 --> 01:43:17,170
Okay.
The total number of people use Youtube

2255
01:43:17,171 --> 01:43:19,210
is,
what is that number?

2256
01:43:19,690 --> 01:43:20,680
Oh my God.

2257
01:43:23,140 --> 01:43:25,990
301 billion.
300 million,

2258
01:43:27,010 --> 01:43:29,890
300 hours of video uploaded to youtube
every minute.

2259
01:43:29,950 --> 01:43:34,690
Almost 5 billion videos are watched on
youtube every single day in an average

2260
01:43:34,690 --> 01:43:37,000
month,
eight out of 10 18 to 49 year olds watch

2261
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:39,100
youtube.
One of the things this woman said to me

2262
01:43:39,101 --> 01:43:42,070
that I,
I agree with her on and I mean I believe

2263
01:43:42,071 --> 01:43:45,070
her because this is not about about
opinion,

2264
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:48,010
is about the way youtube works.
She said,

2265
01:43:48,011 --> 01:43:52,310
right now we have very crude tools to
find the offensive hate speech.

2266
01:43:52,350 --> 01:43:56,690
They're very crude tools.
Sometimes the Mr Mark and sometimes when

2267
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:59,480
you're dealing with like subtlety,
like humor,

2268
01:43:59,810 --> 01:44:01,400
like I could say,
hey you fuck.

2269
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:02,840
And you know people go,
oh,

2270
01:44:02,841 --> 01:44:04,550
he was angry.
Like obviously not.

2271
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:07,400
You hear the tone,
you know like someone saying that

2272
01:44:07,401 --> 01:44:09,080
they're saying it to friends and they're
joking around,

2273
01:44:09,081 --> 01:44:10,730
they're being silly and everybody's
laughing.

2274
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:13,910
Youtube misses that.
They don't,

2275
01:44:13,940 --> 01:44:16,070
they don't know what's humor and what's
not.

2276
01:44:16,190 --> 01:44:19,460
So are you saying that you can never
make a joke about,

2277
01:44:19,550 --> 01:44:21,530
you know,
a guy's Dick or you can never make a

2278
01:44:21,531 --> 01:44:25,760
joke about a girl's vagina or you never
big joke about heterosexual sex,

2279
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:26,571
can you?
No,

2280
01:44:26,571 --> 01:44:27,321
no,
you can do that.

2281
01:44:27,321 --> 01:44:29,300
Okay.
Can I make a joke about gay sex?

2282
01:44:29,690 --> 01:44:30,530
No.
No,

2283
01:44:30,531 --> 01:44:32,210
you can't.
Oh,

2284
01:44:32,211 --> 01:44:33,500
I see.
Because I'm not gay.

2285
01:44:33,710 --> 01:44:35,810
Okay.
Can I make a joke about why people,

2286
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,610
yes.
Can you make a joke about black people?

2287
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:38,910
No.
Oh,

2288
01:44:38,980 --> 01:44:41,060
okay.
What do we do in here?

2289
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:43,850
What are we doing?
You're deciding what people can and

2290
01:44:43,851 --> 01:44:46,880
can't say.
And then they're also demonetizing

2291
01:44:46,881 --> 01:44:50,300
things.
And we've had some demonetize ones that

2292
01:44:50,301 --> 01:44:50,931
were just like,
okay,

2293
01:44:50,931 --> 01:44:53,390
there's gotta be some sort of an
algorithm going on here where there's a

2294
01:44:53,391 --> 01:44:58,160
word we say and that word triggers some
sort of a response and then they say

2295
01:44:58,161 --> 01:44:59,120
that it's up for,
we,

2296
01:44:59,140 --> 01:45:01,010
we,
we have it up for manual review

2297
01:45:01,011 --> 01:45:02,330
sometimes,
but the,

2298
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:06,260
our Douglas Murray one where we talked
about youtube demonetizing videos,

2299
01:45:06,410 --> 01:45:09,650
that one got demonetized he says,
so it's like,

2300
01:45:09,651 --> 01:45:11,660
okay,
are they doing that to fuck with us or

2301
01:45:11,661 --> 01:45:14,270
are they doing that because he douglas
talked about,

2302
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:16,700
um,
radical fundamentalist Islam.

2303
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:19,310
Like what is it?
And their defense,

2304
01:45:19,311 --> 01:45:21,890
it's just that their platform,
they should be able to do whatever they

2305
01:45:21,891 --> 01:45:22,760
want.
Should they though,

2306
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,860
because what are they then?
If it's,

2307
01:45:24,861 --> 01:45:26,780
who is they?
Who is they?

2308
01:45:26,781 --> 01:45:29,390
The people they hired like doesn't that
shift?

2309
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:33,620
Like the assumption is that everybody
who works in management,

2310
01:45:33,621 --> 01:45:37,130
everybody who works behind the scenes
all shares a mindset.

2311
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:39,350
That's crazy.
That doesn't even make any sense.

2312
01:45:39,351 --> 01:45:43,100
That's not even the society like group
think tanks like that.

2313
01:45:43,130 --> 01:45:43,621
Like if,
if,

2314
01:45:43,621 --> 01:45:46,100
if they all agree,
and this was one of the things that

2315
01:45:46,101 --> 01:45:49,790
James Damore pointed out about Google,
it's like they don't leave any room

2316
01:45:49,791 --> 01:45:52,850
whatsoever for conservatives.
Like they absolutely discriminate

2317
01:45:52,851 --> 01:45:55,160
against conservatives.
I'm not conservative,

2318
01:45:55,610 --> 01:45:58,670
but if I was and I worked at a company
like Google,

2319
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:01,550
yeah.
Imagine how fucking on the outside you

2320
01:46:01,551 --> 01:46:04,190
would feel like,
is it illegal to be conservative?

2321
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:08,270
Like isn't there a responsible ethical
form of conservatism that's not racist?

2322
01:46:08,271 --> 01:46:09,580
Not Homophobic,
but,

2323
01:46:09,820 --> 01:46:14,300
but presumes that a conservative person
in power would be more fiscally

2324
01:46:14,301 --> 01:46:16,940
responsible,
will have economic policies that they

2325
01:46:16,941 --> 01:46:19,790
agree with interventionist policies they
agree with.

2326
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:21,830
I don't,
I don't think that that's outside the

2327
01:46:21,831 --> 01:46:25,460
realm of possibility that a reasonable
person could be conservative.

2328
01:46:25,610 --> 01:46:30,610
But if you work for any big tech company
that's not in the menu,

2329
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:34,370
you don't get to be that.
Like you don't get to promote that.

2330
01:46:34,371 --> 01:46:36,650
You don't get to agree with that.
It's weird.

2331
01:46:37,430 --> 01:46:40,370
It's not good because it's not,
it's not open speech.

2332
01:46:41,090 --> 01:46:42,770
You're supposed to be able to talk shit
through.

2333
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:45,650
I'm a,
I like to listen to someone who has a

2334
01:46:45,651 --> 01:46:48,260
very strong opinion about something and
see if it resonates with me.

2335
01:46:48,470 --> 01:46:49,800
Now,
if you stop the stop,

2336
01:46:49,801 --> 01:46:52,340
that'll stifle that.
I was just going to demonetizing

2337
01:46:52,341 --> 01:46:54,330
monetizing a video though isn't,
uh,

2338
01:46:54,630 --> 01:46:55,830
censoring someone.

2339
01:46:55,860 --> 01:46:57,780
It's encouraging censorship.
This is why,

2340
01:46:57,781 --> 01:47:01,320
because you don't want to be demonetized
if you have a video in that video can

2341
01:47:01,321 --> 01:47:03,720
make you $500.
If it's,

2342
01:47:03,721 --> 01:47:06,270
um,
if it's up and it gets ads or it can

2343
01:47:06,271 --> 01:47:08,250
make you $0 million,
but that's,

2344
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:11,910
that's a $500 incentive for you to not
talk about whatever the fuck got it.

2345
01:47:11,911 --> 01:47:13,260
Demonetized right.
But that's,

2346
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:15,150
that then makes your argument,
I'm like,

2347
01:47:15,151 --> 01:47:17,340
what were you making the content for in
the first place?

2348
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:18,620
Or you just make it doesn't to me.
No,

2349
01:47:18,630 --> 01:47:18,991
no,
no,

2350
01:47:18,991 --> 01:47:19,321
no,
no,

2351
01:47:19,321 --> 01:47:19,651
no,
no,

2352
01:47:19,651 --> 01:47:19,951
no,
no.

2353
01:47:19,951 --> 01:47:22,980
It's,
it's a motivation for you to censor your

2354
01:47:22,981 --> 01:47:25,260
speech,
whatever you're making it for in the

2355
01:47:25,261 --> 01:47:28,080
first place.
You presume that someone was just making

2356
01:47:28,081 --> 01:47:31,530
it to make it,
but there's an absolute monetary value

2357
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:35,700
if they put ads on it.
So if they take away the monetary value

2358
01:47:36,150 --> 01:47:39,810
and they do it specifically because you
chose a certain subject that is in fact

2359
01:47:39,811 --> 01:47:43,230
a form of censorship there,
where they're doing is encouraging you

2360
01:47:43,231 --> 01:47:45,450
to self censor in order to make more
money.

2361
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:46,373
They can say,
hey,

2362
01:47:46,430 --> 01:47:49,920
you can do whatever the fuck you want.
We're going to decide that if you talk

2363
01:47:49,921 --> 01:47:53,280
about fill in the blank,
that subject no money,

2364
01:47:53,910 --> 01:47:55,230
so don't talk about that subject
anymore.

2365
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:57,780
They're not going to give you money
because they're sharing that money with

2366
01:47:57,781 --> 01:47:59,970
you though.
You could still share that video on your

2367
01:47:59,971 --> 01:48:02,820
twitter channel.
You could still share it on your blog

2368
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:05,380
and still make money if you can find her
on advertisers.

2369
01:48:05,381 --> 01:48:06,540
There's just,
they see what you're doing.

2370
01:48:06,570 --> 01:48:08,460
I see what you're doing,
but it's not a good argument.

2371
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:10,950
The reason why it's not a good argument
is because they made a concerted

2372
01:48:10,951 --> 01:48:13,710
decision.
They made a very clear decision to take

2373
01:48:13,711 --> 01:48:16,500
away the ads on videos where they don't
like what you're saying.

2374
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:19,590
That just could be because they don't
have advertisers that are willing to pay

2375
01:48:19,591 --> 01:48:21,630
them.
That's all.

2376
01:48:21,630 --> 01:48:24,350
That's the way I would look at it that
I've advertised.

2377
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:28,140
W didn't willing to pay that because of
like Douglas Murray and Sam Harris

2378
01:48:28,141 --> 01:48:28,891
talking.
They just couldn't,

2379
01:48:28,891 --> 01:48:30,810
maybe they couldn't find the money for
it and they're like,

2380
01:48:30,811 --> 01:48:32,770
I guess what?
This does not monetize.

2381
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:33,571
Okay.
You don't know.

2382
01:48:33,571 --> 01:48:36,570
There's this weird making a guess
because you're doing this to try to

2383
01:48:36,571 --> 01:48:38,370
reinforce your original opinion.
I don't.

2384
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:40,710
I don't think it is censorship.
It's a form of censorship.

2385
01:48:41,070 --> 01:48:44,790
I think that the monetizing is not a
good thing because of other ways,

2386
01:48:44,850 --> 01:48:47,970
other reasons that it happens.
I'm on youtube because they then have an

2387
01:48:47,971 --> 01:48:51,240
incentive to share monetize videos
because they're making money on them.

2388
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:54,600
I get that,
but it's just because it's democratized.

2389
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:57,660
Understand that you too,
who has a youtube has an incentive to

2390
01:48:57,661 --> 01:49:00,480
share monetize videos because they're
sharing in the profit of every single

2391
01:49:00,481 --> 01:49:03,260
video monetize video doesn't,
uh,

2392
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:05,880
critters that get 100% of the money,
they get half of the money.

2393
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:07,350
Right?
Youtube gets the other half.

2394
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:09,970
So if a,
if a video is monetized as theirs,

2395
01:49:10,390 --> 01:49:12,300
they've been a fitness sharing them.
Right,

2396
01:49:12,330 --> 01:49:13,080
right,
right.

2397
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:16,230
So that even reinforces more the idea
that they're censoring.

2398
01:49:16,290 --> 01:49:17,071
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

2399
01:49:17,071 --> 01:49:19,950
But like the third,
they're censoring the ability for it to

2400
01:49:19,951 --> 01:49:21,990
share it,
to be shared in the youtube platform,

2401
01:49:22,050 --> 01:49:24,540
not on the Internet.
That's true as a whole,

2402
01:49:24,570 --> 01:49:29,570
but they're not censoring what they're
doing is promoting self censorship by

2403
01:49:30,901 --> 01:49:35,010
giving you a fiscal reward for following
their line.

2404
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,170
Again,
that's just where I'm saying like as a

2405
01:49:37,171 --> 01:49:39,930
creator,
if you're making content to just make

2406
01:49:39,931 --> 01:49:42,690
money on youtube,
then you have to play by their rules.

2407
01:49:43,050 --> 01:49:45,450
Yeah,
I understand what you're saying,

2408
01:49:45,630 --> 01:49:50,630
but what my point about this is,
is what they're doing is they're there,

2409
01:49:52,031 --> 01:49:54,880
they're making their own,
they're making these decisions.

2410
01:49:54,881 --> 01:49:57,310
And who is making these decisions that,
that,

2411
01:49:57,490 --> 01:50:01,330
that also could be definitely said they
should say these are the rules,

2412
01:50:01,390 --> 01:50:01,570
right?

2413
01:50:01,570 --> 01:50:04,270
I'm the person responsible for making
that statement.

2414
01:50:04,330 --> 01:50:06,070
What are the rules?
Here's they don't say,

2415
01:50:06,071 --> 01:50:08,590
they don't say this is what's weird
about it.

2416
01:50:08,620 --> 01:50:12,670
It's totally arbitrary.
There's no like written law that you

2417
01:50:12,671 --> 01:50:14,500
have to follow.
There's no like,

2418
01:50:14,530 --> 01:50:15,820
oh,
you can't say cunt.

2419
01:50:16,030 --> 01:50:18,310
Because if you say con,
you know playtex doesn't want to

2420
01:50:18,311 --> 01:50:20,290
advertise in your fucking video anymore,
right?

2421
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:21,670
No,
there's not that.

2422
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:24,070
It's weird that they don't tell you what
to do.

2423
01:50:24,071 --> 01:50:27,730
Monetize video is like when we get one,
they don't say it's because you guys

2424
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:29,880
talked about about youtube.
No,

2425
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:30,820
they don't say shit.

2426
01:50:31,270 --> 01:50:32,620
It's,
it's fucking weird,

2427
01:50:32,621 --> 01:50:34,660
man.
Never fucked with me in eight years.

2428
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:36,850
Youtube fucks with me every day.
Right.

2429
01:50:36,851 --> 01:50:37,450
But the thing about

2430
01:50:37,450 --> 01:50:41,020
Vimeo is the difference in the numbers
is so radical.

2431
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:42,820
Like,
if we have a video that gets a million

2432
01:50:42,821 --> 01:50:45,430
hits on Youtube,
it'll get 20,000 on vimeo.

2433
01:50:45,450 --> 01:50:46,283
Right?

2434
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:49,810
Like I've been using vimeo live lately.
And you know,

2435
01:50:49,811 --> 01:50:52,840
if you have youtube liar,
you look at the chat room in Youtube,

2436
01:50:53,290 --> 01:50:57,640
90% just negative,
angry horseshit vimeo community.

2437
01:50:57,720 --> 01:51:00,970
Like I think we had like 400 people last
night watching killed Tony.

2438
01:51:01,570 --> 01:51:03,190
Everyone was positive,
just nice,

2439
01:51:03,191 --> 01:51:05,050
happy,
no negative trolling,

2440
01:51:05,230 --> 01:51:07,590
which is like a different popular yet.
Yeah,

2441
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:12,550
but it was a different environment.
Guess that's why they don't get like

2442
01:51:12,551 --> 01:51:15,460
youtube,
they don't have things like ip bands.

2443
01:51:15,461 --> 01:51:17,080
They're like,
if you get banned on Youtube,

2444
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:19,510
you just get a new gene,
Gmail address and now you have a new

2445
01:51:19,511 --> 01:51:22,990
fucking thing where like other places
like vimeo and stuff like that,

2446
01:51:22,991 --> 01:51:24,910
you get banned.
You're pretty much band band.

2447
01:51:24,911 --> 01:51:25,960
You know?
That's how it should be.

2448
01:51:25,961 --> 01:51:26,794
Right?
Right.

2449
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:30,400
Damn fault.
Who should be deciding if you get

2450
01:51:30,401 --> 01:51:31,090
banned,
banned,

2451
01:51:31,090 --> 01:51:33,940
that's going to be an ip band that like
someone was at your house and now you're

2452
01:51:33,941 --> 01:51:37,360
banned from using youtube because
someone was over or a neighbor is using

2453
01:51:37,361 --> 01:51:40,360
your wifi and they fucked you.
It's also your responsibility to know

2454
01:51:40,361 --> 01:51:41,970
that.
I guess it'd be mb.

2455
01:51:42,180 --> 01:51:43,600
I mean that's like looking at Kiddie
porn.

2456
01:51:43,601 --> 01:51:45,280
Like go to your friend's house and look
at Kitty Porn.

2457
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:46,780
You'd get arrested,
you know,

2458
01:51:46,781 --> 01:51:50,230
cause it's your ip address.
Or if you go over a friends house and

2459
01:51:50,231 --> 01:51:52,540
watch his Kiddie Porn,
did you get arrested?

2460
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:55,240
If you do it in a car,
you're not supposed to watch it.

2461
01:51:55,241 --> 01:51:57,700
Right?
What are you like to listen to it?

2462
01:51:58,290 --> 01:52:00,870
That's a good question.
Yeah,

2463
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:01,870
right.
No,

2464
01:52:01,871 --> 01:52:04,510
I bet you're not.
I mean,

2465
01:52:04,511 --> 01:52:07,990
but that's one of those things where we
decide that people shouldn't have that

2466
01:52:07,991 --> 01:52:09,940
in their life,
you know?

2467
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:14,860
But here's the question.
What are they going to do when they have

2468
01:52:15,010 --> 01:52:20,010
CGI
that they can program to have very

2469
01:52:20,770 --> 01:52:25,770
realistic looking pedophile porn,
but there's no human being involved.

2470
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:29,990
Then it was kind of like those dogs.
You saw those dollars as pd dolls,

2471
01:52:30,250 --> 01:52:31,540
pedophile dollars.
Do you,

2472
01:52:31,740 --> 01:52:33,800
what do you think about those?
Do you think there should be the sex

2473
01:52:33,801 --> 01:52:36,600
doll kid sect stalls?
I don't know about that.

2474
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:41,310
Disney's latest research project can
turn scripts into virtual reality.

2475
01:52:41,340 --> 01:52:43,920
What does that something new that it's
definitely not out yet,

2476
01:52:43,921 --> 01:52:46,070
but they're just showed this that they
can turn

2477
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:51,070
written scripts into very crude CGI
virtual reality experiences.

2478
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:52,940
Holy Shit.
Yeah,

2479
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:57,020
so this is just the early version of it.
This might take off if they decide to

2480
01:52:57,021 --> 01:52:59,600
continue to push money into it and
figure it out.

2481
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:03,350
Get deciphered by the commuter computer,
which creates images.

2482
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:06,060
I believe so.
I was trying to read it to understand

2483
01:53:06,061 --> 01:53:07,620
it.
That's sort of what they're saying.

2484
01:53:08,860 --> 01:53:10,880
That's sweet.
That's so crazy.

2485
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:12,530
That's a,
but that's inevitable.

2486
01:53:12,710 --> 01:53:15,800
This is probably going to be like the
upper level CGI,

2487
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:17,570
like you're going to be able to write
it.

2488
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:20,870
Then you're going to be able to talk
into it and it's going to create things.

2489
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:24,350
You're going to have a fucking headset
on and you're going to be in a room and

2490
01:53:24,351 --> 01:53:28,340
you're going to say,
I want to be in the Avatar world and

2491
01:53:28,341 --> 01:53:32,150
ride a dragon and I want to be blue and
I want to have a bow and Arrow and I

2492
01:53:32,151 --> 01:53:34,580
want to go to the tree of life.
And all that shit is going to be right

2493
01:53:34,581 --> 01:53:36,480
in front of you.
Yeah.

2494
01:53:36,530 --> 01:53:38,990
They're going to just to be able to do
it with virtual reality based on your

2495
01:53:38,991 --> 01:53:41,780
suggestions and then they're gonna
figure out a way to get your brain to

2496
01:53:41,781 --> 01:53:43,100
interface with that thing.

2497
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:46,070
Whereas they've already figured out a
way to get a kid to move his car.

2498
01:53:46,100 --> 01:53:49,640
Someone was paralyzed and they got this
person to move their cursor.

2499
01:53:49,670 --> 01:53:51,380
I don't know if it was a kid.
Um,

2500
01:53:51,590 --> 01:53:54,050
they've,
they've had a bunch of different things

2501
01:53:54,051 --> 01:53:56,330
where they've used the mind to control
things.

2502
01:53:56,570 --> 01:53:59,780
I did a thing on Joe Rogan questions,
everything where I put this headset on

2503
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:01,220
and I got,
um,

2504
01:54:02,050 --> 01:54:02,790
uh,
a,

2505
01:54:02,790 --> 01:54:06,410
a drone to listen to me.
I could get it to lift up off the ground

2506
01:54:06,411 --> 01:54:09,470
if I thought a certain way and that shit
is coming.

2507
01:54:09,650 --> 01:54:10,540
It's already out.
Yeah.

2508
01:54:10,620 --> 01:54:13,250
But I mean that shit in like in your
mind,

2509
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:15,410
be able to conceive a whole different
world.

2510
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:17,000
Right.
Did you see a,

2511
01:54:17,001 --> 01:54:18,620
an isolation?
No.

2512
01:54:18,650 --> 01:54:19,910
It's trippy.
It's that.

2513
01:54:20,090 --> 01:54:22,010
That's the new movie from the
[inaudible] a guy.

2514
01:54:22,670 --> 01:54:23,950
Oh yeah.
Fuck,

2515
01:54:23,980 --> 01:54:24,860
that's good.
Okay.

2516
01:54:25,010 --> 01:54:27,350
Trippy.
I see that trippy to the point where you

2517
01:54:27,351 --> 01:54:28,460
go,
what am we're watching here?

2518
01:54:28,770 --> 01:54:31,360
So this,
I think I showed you this once before,

2519
01:54:31,361 --> 01:54:33,760
but this is a good video of it.
This is a eye tracking thing that's

2520
01:54:33,761 --> 01:54:36,550
built into laptops.
It's built in an alienware laptops now.

2521
01:54:36,700 --> 01:54:38,270
Whoa.
This guy's just looking at those dots

2522
01:54:38,271 --> 01:54:39,310
and they're exploding.
He's,

2523
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:43,210
Oh,
so he just eyes his eyes just mice.

2524
01:54:43,270 --> 01:54:45,490
Oh my God.
And it works really well.

2525
01:54:45,610 --> 01:54:46,980
That's crazy.
Yeah.

2526
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:49,500
So your eyes control the mouse.
Yeah,

2527
01:54:49,510 --> 01:54:52,350
you can play games with it.
Oh my God.

2528
01:54:52,420 --> 01:54:54,580
Justice eyes.
No Way.

2529
01:54:54,700 --> 01:54:58,750
That'd be amazing for your eyes.
That seems like an awesome I exercise,

2530
01:54:59,140 --> 01:55:01,150
but it's a,
it's not there yet though.

2531
01:55:02,770 --> 01:55:03,610
Very,
very new.

2532
01:55:03,611 --> 01:55:06,620
And it's already out and they just like
announced the new vibe pro.

2533
01:55:06,850 --> 01:55:09,520
Or if you try to play quake on this,
they're gonna fuck you up.

2534
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:12,370
Try to use your shitty eyes and some
dude's holding a mouse.

2535
01:55:13,460 --> 01:55:16,360
It's very close to having this like with
either in your phone so you can just

2536
01:55:16,361 --> 01:55:19,960
control games on your phone or put that
in a little Ar Vr headset.

2537
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:23,770
I can't say I'm shocked.
Ready player one this Friday.

2538
01:55:24,210 --> 01:55:26,410
Is that,
that the book?

2539
01:55:26,740 --> 01:55:29,020
Have you read ready player one?
It's about the future.

2540
01:55:29,050 --> 01:55:31,030
Uh,
it's new Spielberg movie that comes out

2541
01:55:31,031 --> 01:55:32,430
I think Friday.
Uh,

2542
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:33,041
about,
oh,

2543
01:55:33,041 --> 01:55:34,830
I've seen the ads for that bad.
Yeah.

2544
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:37,870
That looks crazy in here.
Ooh,

2545
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:42,160
this will describe the whole future.
You keep bringing up and like everyone

2546
01:55:42,161 --> 01:55:44,190
lives in a pod locking into

2547
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:45,023
the vr.

2548
01:55:45,610 --> 01:55:47,500
It's going to happen.
This is Columbus,

2549
01:55:47,501 --> 01:55:50,140
Ohio Dude.
How many people do you run into that are

2550
01:55:50,141 --> 01:55:53,140
just not doing good?
They're not living a good life.

2551
01:55:53,170 --> 01:55:55,090
Like everything's not going so well.
Like,

2552
01:55:55,091 --> 01:55:57,910
I was just in Fresno the other day and
um,

2553
01:55:58,360 --> 01:56:00,240
uh,
when we were drought,

2554
01:56:00,250 --> 01:56:02,950
Tony and I did a gig up there and when
we're driving around the town,

2555
01:56:03,370 --> 01:56:06,220
there's streets filled with homeless
people,

2556
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:08,830
homeless,
like encampments everywhere.

2557
01:56:09,610 --> 01:56:12,250
I mean there's,
there's people that just are in a bad

2558
01:56:12,251 --> 01:56:16,060
place and they can't,
it's not going to get any better where

2559
01:56:16,061 --> 01:56:19,230
they live.
If someone comes along and introduces

2560
01:56:19,260 --> 01:56:21,670
something and it's just like a cell
phone,

2561
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:25,780
everybody has it.
And you all lock into that thing.

2562
01:56:26,290 --> 01:56:27,280
Yeah.
Columbus,

2563
01:56:27,281 --> 01:56:29,660
Ohio to 20,
45 is that we did it.

2564
01:56:29,690 --> 01:56:33,140
This is what it's like homeless people,
all the streets put this headset on and

2565
01:56:33,460 --> 01:56:34,840
in the world.
Yeah.

2566
01:56:36,150 --> 01:56:37,560
The real cool thing I think about the
movie,

2567
01:56:37,561 --> 01:56:39,480
which is the plot,
which isn't giveaway much cause I

2568
01:56:39,481 --> 01:56:40,680
haven't read the book.
So I don't know.

2569
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:43,920
It sounds like something that could
happen soon is that there's like a bug

2570
01:56:44,070 --> 01:56:47,640
in the game and there's a prize for it
that everyone's going after the bug

2571
01:56:47,641 --> 01:56:50,600
price ever confined.
It gets on like Willy Wonka style.

2572
01:56:50,601 --> 01:56:51,420
Yeah.
You could do the thing.

2573
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:54,270
And what's really interesting is that
the movie also has,

2574
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:57,330
cause you pick an Avatar just like a
video game or facebook.

2575
01:56:57,420 --> 01:57:01,050
So people are picking like I went to be
King Kong kongs in,

2576
01:57:01,051 --> 01:57:04,910
in like back to the future cars in it,
in the cure is motorcycles in it and you

2577
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:07,740
know the iron giant Senate and oh Freddy
Krueger's in it.

2578
01:57:07,950 --> 01:57:08,461
It's just,
you know,

2579
01:57:08,461 --> 01:57:09,360
so they,
they've,

2580
01:57:09,810 --> 01:57:12,420
they got to use a lot of different
franchise.

2581
01:57:12,421 --> 01:57:15,420
There's a speed racer car back to the
future.

2582
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:16,320
Yeah.
I mean it's,

2583
01:57:16,321 --> 01:57:18,180
this is,
this is all inevitable.

2584
01:57:18,330 --> 01:57:22,710
I mean if they're going to continue the
same path that they're on now,

2585
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:25,650
if you go back and look at the video
games that we used to see when we were

2586
01:57:25,651 --> 01:57:28,830
kids,
like can you play mortal Kombat on a

2587
01:57:28,831 --> 01:57:30,540
console?
It was kind of cool.

2588
01:57:30,570 --> 01:57:32,280
But the,
compared to this,

2589
01:57:32,460 --> 01:57:33,720
it's like Pong,
right?

2590
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:35,910
And it's going to happen.
It's just going to keep going.

2591
01:57:36,270 --> 01:57:38,880
It's just a matter of where,
where it's going to leave us.

2592
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:41,190
Like what are,
we're not going to be people anymore

2593
01:57:41,191 --> 01:57:43,680
real soon.
Cause in a hundred years we're not going

2594
01:57:43,681 --> 01:57:45,810
to be people anymore.
We're going to be some weird new thing.

2595
01:57:48,300 --> 01:57:50,280
Do you think we'll be here?
I don't think so.

2596
01:57:50,550 --> 01:57:51,690
We'll be dead.
Um,

2597
01:57:51,780 --> 01:57:54,990
but like that thing that's on the bottom
of the ocean that they found that

2598
01:57:54,991 --> 01:57:56,640
dinosaur thing,
we're going to be like one of those

2599
01:57:56,641 --> 01:57:57,840
things like,
oh Jesus,

2600
01:57:58,170 --> 01:58:01,140
like that thing like it's crazy because
we know that they used to exist.

2601
01:58:01,141 --> 01:58:02,520
Right?
So if we find one today,

2602
01:58:02,521 --> 01:58:03,480
like wow,
nuts.

2603
01:58:03,481 --> 01:58:05,640
I think still here that's going to be
like people,

2604
01:58:05,670 --> 01:58:08,640
they find some dude who's living in the
mountains outside of Colorado is like

2605
01:58:08,990 --> 01:58:12,210
he'd catch his own fish.
He's 116 years old and they finally

2606
01:58:12,220 --> 01:58:13,290
like,
look at this guy.

2607
01:58:13,410 --> 01:58:15,480
He's got no electronics and it's all
body.

2608
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:18,420
Do you think it'd be like Amish people
would still ask her that for instance,

2609
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:19,530
or would be,
would that be them?

2610
01:58:19,770 --> 01:58:21,430
We'd kill those.
Eat them.

2611
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:24,040
They would have to kill him.
The robot people would have to kill the

2612
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:24,530
moms.

2613
01:58:24,530 --> 01:58:25,710
We can't have him around.
They would,

2614
01:58:25,711 --> 01:58:28,020
they would think they would say,
well are there like wildlife?

2615
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:31,980
They like wildlife after a certain point
because if we all started out as some

2616
01:58:31,981 --> 01:58:35,490
sort of pro hominid back in the early
days of evolution,

2617
01:58:35,491 --> 01:58:37,110
right?
We started as some sort of primitive

2618
01:58:37,111 --> 01:58:40,050
primate and that eventually evolved to
be what we are now,

2619
01:58:40,410 --> 01:58:42,970
but there's still chimps around there
still monkeys around.

2620
01:58:42,971 --> 01:58:47,800
There's still a lot of primitive
primates like did they evolve at a later

2621
01:58:47,801 --> 01:58:50,280
date?
Did they start later than us to dislike

2622
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:52,900
that they get a different car call time
to the race,

2623
01:58:53,320 --> 01:58:58,320
like what happened or did some things
stay the same while other things change

2624
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:01,450
and it's just the rate of change seem so
spectacularly quick,

2625
01:59:01,570 --> 01:59:03,130
but it's only because of our
perspective,

2626
01:59:03,490 --> 01:59:08,410
but really there could be groups of
people and might be the amish that stay

2627
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:13,560
exactly the same and then the new beings
treat them like colobus monkeys in the

2628
01:59:13,961 --> 01:59:15,160
jungle or leg.

2629
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:19,020
Some fucking weird giraffe that you see
when you go on a safari.

2630
01:59:19,030 --> 01:59:19,511
Look,
look,

2631
01:59:19,511 --> 01:59:20,890
look.
The people that make their own butter,

2632
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:22,810
they're real,
they're real,

2633
01:59:22,930 --> 01:59:24,910
and we'd wave at him,
hello,

2634
01:59:25,390 --> 01:59:27,820
I love your wagon.
I mean,

2635
01:59:28,990 --> 01:59:32,860
they could become wildlife.
They can become a very primitive form of

2636
01:59:32,861 --> 01:59:35,110
wildlife.
They could become like uncontacted

2637
01:59:35,111 --> 01:59:37,570
tribes in the Amazon where we just leave
them alone.

2638
01:59:37,571 --> 01:59:39,040
We think they're novel.
Look,

2639
01:59:39,041 --> 01:59:40,960
look,
they're painted all read their whole

2640
01:59:40,961 --> 01:59:43,000
body.
They have a bow and arrow that they made

2641
01:59:43,001 --> 01:59:45,550
themselves.
This is amazing.

2642
01:59:45,730 --> 01:59:48,340
We get all excited about it,
but it's the same exact shit,

2643
01:59:49,210 --> 01:59:53,170
same exact shit to us like then when the
new things take over,

2644
01:59:53,171 --> 01:59:55,480
they just keep the amish.
They keep tribes,

2645
01:59:55,481 --> 01:59:57,580
people,
they keep the weird shit that's not

2646
01:59:57,581 --> 01:59:59,620
going to fuck with them.
Anything that doesn't know how to work

2647
01:59:59,621 --> 02:00:01,990
electricity,
all those people that are out there

2648
02:00:01,991 --> 02:00:06,340
living without electricity.
You know like those Alaska,

2649
02:00:06,341 --> 02:00:09,040
the last frontier shows,
those people would have to all plead for

2650
02:00:09,041 --> 02:00:10,570
their life and would be like,
look,

2651
02:00:10,571 --> 02:00:15,571
I'm just here homogenous over just
taking care of cattle and I'm not

2652
02:00:15,701 --> 02:00:18,510
planning on getting any weapons and we
are.

2653
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:21,970
We like a simple life and we're happy
for our robot overlords.

2654
02:00:21,971 --> 02:00:25,080
Congratulations on your victory and just
leave this up here.

2655
02:00:25,970 --> 02:00:28,640
Ha Ha,
fuck that.

2656
02:00:28,641 --> 02:00:31,910
Right
when I was getting my eyes looked at,

2657
02:00:31,940 --> 02:00:36,810
the doctor said that how people's eyes
are a lot worse nowadays and we number.

2658
02:00:36,830 --> 02:00:38,120
When you're a kid,
your mom was like,

2659
02:00:38,210 --> 02:00:40,400
don't sit so close to your team,
the the TV.

2660
02:00:40,401 --> 02:00:44,180
But now we're putting goggles in her
eyes like one inch from our eye.

2661
02:00:44,510 --> 02:00:46,970
What's the,
why are we doing that?

2662
02:00:46,971 --> 02:00:49,400
Like what?
Why does no one talked about ihealth?

2663
02:00:49,690 --> 02:00:53,510
You know,
cause it seems like if my optician or

2664
02:00:53,511 --> 02:00:56,780
whatever she's called is telling me
about like how do you should get these

2665
02:00:56,781 --> 02:01:00,230
blue blocker things now you're,
everyone's eyes are so stressed

2666
02:01:00,231 --> 02:01:02,030
nowadays.
I think that's true.

2667
02:01:02,090 --> 02:01:05,600
I think guys are definitely stress,
but it's also that we're getting old.

2668
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:07,130
Yeah.
When you get old your eyes,

2669
02:01:07,131 --> 02:01:10,370
you go to shit.
Everybody's always has except like my

2670
02:01:10,371 --> 02:01:15,050
friend Cameron Hanes,
he's 50 his fucking eyes are like 2018

2671
02:01:15,051 --> 02:01:15,470
or something.

2672
02:01:15,470 --> 02:01:17,630
It's crazy.
Like I had a crack on my iphone.

2673
02:01:17,631 --> 02:01:19,730
I dropped my iphone and I looked at it.
I'm like,

2674
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:20,571
ah,
I think it's all right.

2675
02:01:20,571 --> 02:01:20,841
He goes,
no,

2676
02:01:20,841 --> 02:01:21,770
you got to crack.
I go,

2677
02:01:21,771 --> 02:01:22,910
really?
He goes,

2678
02:01:22,911 --> 02:01:24,320
where?
He goes right in the lower right hand

2679
02:01:24,321 --> 02:01:24,980
corner.
I'm like,

2680
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:26,060
motherfucker.
I'm like,

2681
02:01:26,061 --> 02:01:29,930
how'd you even see that?
He could see it from my hand,

2682
02:01:30,140 --> 02:01:34,430
like my hand over here and he's here.
He's like fucking five feet away from

2683
02:01:34,431 --> 02:01:34,851
me.
You can see it.

2684
02:01:34,851 --> 02:01:37,310
I got this fucker inches from my face.
I can't see it.

2685
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:41,540
I mean it's been three years since I,
my eyes checked and I used to always be

2686
02:01:41,541 --> 02:01:43,730
perfect.
This was the first time where that

2687
02:01:43,731 --> 02:01:45,050
bottom row,
I was like,

2688
02:01:45,070 --> 02:01:47,610
it's an eight or a zero.
Is that an eight or does he wrong?

2689
02:01:48,290 --> 02:01:49,880
You get a menu in a restaurant.
You're like,

2690
02:01:49,910 --> 02:01:51,320
okay,
I'm going to have to start a fire and I

2691
02:01:51,321 --> 02:01:54,130
see this.
I'm going to have to bust out a little

2692
02:01:54,131 --> 02:01:55,550
wider.
Like a fucking concert.

2693
02:01:55,730 --> 02:01:56,680
Yeah,
or use the,

2694
02:01:56,720 --> 02:01:58,940
the gets super obnoxious if you use your
phone,

2695
02:01:59,090 --> 02:02:02,920
that light on your phone or there's a
magnifying app on the phone now it's

2696
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:04,180
like zooms in a little seat.

2697
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:05,630
Dark.
My,

2698
02:02:05,820 --> 02:02:08,780
my low light sensitivities way
different.

2699
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:10,870
I'm just,
I think it's probably because my,

2700
02:02:10,900 --> 02:02:14,360
my brain is overwhelmed by brightness
too much.

2701
02:02:14,380 --> 02:02:16,820
You know,
like staring at a computer screen.

2702
02:02:17,390 --> 02:02:19,790
That's one of the things that I like
about that right room app.

2703
02:02:20,090 --> 02:02:21,710
I'm going to sneeze.
Unfortunately.

2704
02:02:23,350 --> 02:02:26,830
That right room APP gives you a dark
black screen with green lighting,

2705
02:02:27,010 --> 02:02:28,590
green writing.
I guess it's a sweat.

2706
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:30,760
These glasses do they block the blue
light?

2707
02:02:30,761 --> 02:02:32,910
It's kind of like night mode on your Mac
or,

2708
02:02:33,250 --> 02:02:35,070
or your phone where it turns yellow.
Oh,

2709
02:02:35,071 --> 02:02:37,150
okay.
But that supposedly way better on your

2710
02:02:37,151 --> 02:02:38,260
eyes.
I'm sure it's better,

2711
02:02:38,261 --> 02:02:39,640
but we're still falling.
Hameroff fucked.

2712
02:02:39,700 --> 02:02:41,560
We're going down.
It's going down.

2713
02:02:41,590 --> 02:02:43,390
They're gonna replace her eyes with a
lots of can't wait.

2714
02:02:43,750 --> 02:02:44,950
Oh,
that's these drops.

2715
02:02:44,951 --> 02:02:46,270
Yeah,
they have seen some news.

2716
02:02:46,360 --> 02:02:48,910
New eyedrops they think they're gonna be
able to put in your eye and you never

2717
02:02:48,911 --> 02:02:51,700
have to wear glasses again.
What do they do though?

2718
02:02:51,730 --> 02:02:53,840
Is it a genetic thing?
Nanoparticles.

2719
02:02:54,150 --> 02:02:57,010
So fucking Christ,
that's how they're going to get in to

2720
02:02:57,011 --> 02:03:02,011
getting in through your eyes.
So how's it explained how it works prior

2721
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:06,040
to drop them in every couple of weeks or
every week or maybe even every day.

2722
02:03:06,190 --> 02:03:08,620
It's not for sure yet,
but it's not even out yet.

2723
02:03:08,621 --> 02:03:10,100
Obviously you there?
That's crazy.

2724
02:03:10,101 --> 02:03:11,020
And just very new.

2725
02:03:11,330 --> 02:03:13,400
It works though.
That's crazy.

2726
02:03:14,240 --> 02:03:18,770
Three step process performing the
smartphone or the measurement of the

2727
02:03:18,771 --> 02:03:19,550
eyes.
Your fraction.

2728
02:03:19,550 --> 02:03:20,630
Okay.
Wow.

2729
02:03:20,690 --> 02:03:22,550
And you'll just be able to drop it in
there.

2730
02:03:23,300 --> 02:03:28,040
Apply to the eye for less than one
second a laser though.

2731
02:03:28,041 --> 02:03:32,660
So then doctors create a very specific
laser pattern which is applied to the

2732
02:03:32,661 --> 02:03:35,960
eye for less than one second.
The laser creates tiny grooves in the

2733
02:03:35,961 --> 02:03:39,260
surface of the cornea.
Lastly,

2734
02:03:39,261 --> 02:03:42,410
special eyedrops or applied.
Whoa.

2735
02:03:42,411 --> 02:03:44,990
Like a good idea.
So they get a measurement of your IRA

2736
02:03:44,991 --> 02:03:48,440
fraction,
which can then be performed with a smart

2737
02:03:48,441 --> 02:03:49,640
phone.
Wow.

2738
02:03:49,670 --> 02:03:51,220
That can be performed with the
smartphone.

2739
02:03:51,230 --> 02:03:54,620
The first part.
And the doctors create the laser pattern

2740
02:03:54,621 --> 02:03:58,270
and then they,
they fucking storm trooper your eyeball,

2741
02:03:59,460 --> 02:04:02,750
drop some chemicals on there and the
chemicals get in through the holes that

2742
02:04:02,751 --> 02:04:07,160
you've made in your eyeball.
What chicken?

2743
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:09,080
The right.
How amazing is that?

2744
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:12,580
What does that works?
I mean I've been,

2745
02:04:12,650 --> 02:04:15,290
I think that's going to happen with that
hearing will probably be get something

2746
02:04:15,291 --> 02:04:17,420
for that soon too because what if it's
one of those,

2747
02:04:17,421 --> 02:04:20,750
uh,
artificial hip things like artificial

2748
02:04:20,751 --> 02:04:22,520
hip is like,
it does work.

2749
02:04:22,670 --> 02:04:24,050
But I was like,
I'm always like,

2750
02:04:24,051 --> 02:04:25,710
man,
I feel like they're going to figure out

2751
02:04:25,711 --> 02:04:28,190
a better way right now.
Like five years.

2752
02:04:28,191 --> 02:04:31,880
Like how long can you hang in there?
I feel like there it's so close to

2753
02:04:31,881 --> 02:04:36,881
regenerating tissue re,
re the regenerating all sorts of um,

2754
02:04:37,060 --> 02:04:41,200
cartilage and people and in certain
people that have had like a,

2755
02:04:41,201 --> 02:04:44,750
I know women had bladder cancer,
they regenerated and an entire,

2756
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:47,550
um,
a bladder for her made out of skin

2757
02:04:47,551 --> 02:04:50,790
tissue.
They did this all with stem cells and

2758
02:04:50,791 --> 02:04:53,970
Mel Gibson's dad and that dude was,
uh,

2759
02:04:54,060 --> 02:04:59,060
his dad was 92 and he was like on the
door and it got shot up with stem cells

2760
02:04:59,251 --> 02:05:01,140
and now he's not even a wheelchair
anymore.

2761
02:05:01,530 --> 02:05:02,161
Yeah,
the whole story,

2762
02:05:02,161 --> 02:05:04,650
it was like what?
Like his hip was bothering him so bad.

2763
02:05:04,860 --> 02:05:06,230
He was in a wheelchair,
goes,

2764
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:08,820
gets shot up with stem cells.
And then all of a sudden he's walking

2765
02:05:08,821 --> 02:05:09,654
around.
Yeah,

2766
02:05:10,530 --> 02:05:13,530
yeah.
This and this is like without being able

2767
02:05:13,531 --> 02:05:17,760
to be fully explored in the United
States like this is they have to go to

2768
02:05:17,761 --> 02:05:20,190
Panama to do this.
They're really weren't that guy.

2769
02:05:20,191 --> 02:05:25,191
Dr Neil Riordan is working to try to
bring it to Texas and if anybody would

2770
02:05:25,230 --> 02:05:26,640
be like,
we don't give a fuck,

2771
02:05:26,641 --> 02:05:28,350
let's do it.
It would be Texas,

2772
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:31,560
you know,
because this is all adult stem cells.

2773
02:05:31,561 --> 02:05:34,000
There's no issues with like fetal stem
cells.

2774
02:05:34,001 --> 02:05:37,020
So w religious people wouldn't get
involved in it and there's a lot of

2775
02:05:37,021 --> 02:05:39,360
folks that have like some serious
fucking injuries.

2776
02:05:39,400 --> 02:05:41,250
This shit could really help.
Hell yeah.

2777
02:05:41,430 --> 02:05:43,890
Even I heard that you could do things
for the mouth now.

2778
02:05:43,890 --> 02:05:48,890
Like teeth re Greek row a my gums and
teeth and you can pretty much do

2779
02:05:49,321 --> 02:05:51,630
anything now.
I believe this Tim's house,

2780
02:05:51,870 --> 02:05:55,590
I think this is only one step.
I think when,

2781
02:05:55,591 --> 02:05:57,840
you know,
we're thinking back like 2030 years ago,

2782
02:05:57,841 --> 02:06:00,300
you never heard about this shit and now
you're hearing about it.

2783
02:06:00,330 --> 02:06:02,160
Like what?
How much better is it going to be in

2784
02:06:02,161 --> 02:06:03,840
2030 years from now?
I mean,

2785
02:06:03,841 --> 02:06:07,950
how much of it it's going to be
nanoparticles mixed with stem cells and

2786
02:06:07,951 --> 02:06:10,020
they just fucking regenerate your whole
body.

2787
02:06:10,590 --> 02:06:13,290
You know,
I think that's what's going to happen.

2788
02:06:13,650 --> 02:06:16,650
I think people are going to be able to
not just regenerate limbs,

2789
02:06:16,860 --> 02:06:18,840
but I think they're going to be able to
regrow your Bot.

2790
02:06:18,841 --> 02:06:23,400
Like refresh your body,
like whatever your old bullshit ass

2791
02:06:23,401 --> 02:06:25,950
cells that you have in your body,
they're going to figure out where the

2792
02:06:25,951 --> 02:06:29,430
memories are actually stored.
That's going to be,

2793
02:06:29,620 --> 02:06:33,420
that's going to be a trip if we find out
that memories are not just in your head,

2794
02:06:33,421 --> 02:06:37,170
but also in your body.
So like what if we completely redo the

2795
02:06:37,171 --> 02:06:39,510
body but keep the brain and you don't
remember shit.

2796
02:06:42,630 --> 02:06:46,020
If your brain,
your brain is just a conduit for these

2797
02:06:46,021 --> 02:06:49,740
memories that are stored in your soul
and you've kind of replaced yourself

2798
02:06:49,741 --> 02:06:54,741
with some fake Zombie body with Nano
bots and the brain didn't remember shit.

2799
02:06:55,740 --> 02:06:59,790
Our shadows memories,
that doesn't make any sense.

2800
02:07:00,780 --> 02:07:02,010
They do think that,
um,

2801
02:07:02,190 --> 02:07:03,520
the people have,
uh,

2802
02:07:03,540 --> 02:07:08,540
neurons in their heart that they might,
that this idea of like following your

2803
02:07:08,881 --> 02:07:12,760
heart and thinking with your heart
apparently is more neurons in the heart

2804
02:07:12,761 --> 02:07:16,980
and there on the brain.
It's a true and gut and gut.

2805
02:07:17,100 --> 02:07:18,810
The heart and gut than there are on the
brain.

2806
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:22,340
Nice.
And my stomach was smarter than my head,

2807
02:07:22,430 --> 02:07:23,590
not brain cells.
I don't think that,

2808
02:07:23,730 --> 02:07:27,060
well that's no just neurons.
But that makes sense,

2809
02:07:27,061 --> 02:07:28,990
right?
Trust your gut like that.

2810
02:07:29,090 --> 02:07:31,230
You always heard that says trust your
heart.

2811
02:07:31,500 --> 02:07:33,780
40,000 neurons in the heart.
Whoa.

2812
02:07:33,870 --> 02:07:34,710
How many is in the brain?

2813
02:07:37,120 --> 02:07:39,040
Trust your heart.
Trust your gut.

2814
02:07:40,210 --> 02:07:43,810
Trust your mind.
Your mind is the only thing that

2815
02:07:43,811 --> 02:07:47,740
controls your perspective.
Weird feeling about this.

2816
02:07:47,980 --> 02:07:50,620
Well that's the thing about eating
healthy food.

2817
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:54,340
That's a big thing is that you're,
you're changing the gut bacteria,

2818
02:07:54,370 --> 02:07:57,670
which literally changes who you are.
You have to think about it that way.

2819
02:07:58,060 --> 02:08:02,020
Like it changes the person you are
because the person you are,

2820
02:08:02,580 --> 02:08:04,300
it's all those things have to be in
order.

2821
02:08:04,301 --> 02:08:06,020
Your head has to be in order.
You know,

2822
02:08:06,021 --> 02:08:09,910
you have to like have the right amount
of certain healthy bacteria in your

2823
02:08:09,911 --> 02:08:10,950
system.
Otherwise it doesn't.

2824
02:08:11,010 --> 02:08:12,280
It doesn't,
it's not even you anymore.

2825
02:08:12,450 --> 02:08:17,310
It's just some crazy takeover of 10 DDA.
It's quite,

2826
02:08:17,350 --> 02:08:19,900
according to the article,
I just found about 40,000 and the heart,

2827
02:08:20,140 --> 02:08:22,270
100 million in the stomach.
Wow.

2828
02:08:22,271 --> 02:08:23,830
Whoa.
100 billion in your brain.

2829
02:08:24,330 --> 02:08:25,570
Why Lillian?
Oh,

2830
02:08:25,571 --> 02:08:26,440
well that's wrong.

2831
02:08:27,130 --> 02:08:28,960
Whoever said that,
it is more in the heart.

2832
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:32,230
That's so wrong.
Boy.

2833
02:08:32,231 --> 02:08:35,950
Glad I googled that one.
It says it's in both.

2834
02:08:35,980 --> 02:08:37,540
It's in the heart and stomach.
Just not,

2835
02:08:37,630 --> 02:08:40,090
there's not more.
What did I fucking,

2836
02:08:40,210 --> 02:08:42,620
how did I read that then?
How could someone be that off that I

2837
02:08:42,621 --> 02:08:44,350
read it or it was just my memory is that
bad.

2838
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:47,830
I'm going to go with my memory.
Whatever it is.

2839
02:08:48,410 --> 02:08:51,820
Um,
imagine that those memories in that

2840
02:08:51,821 --> 02:08:56,821
heart remain in the heart and you
transfer your heart into somebody else's

2841
02:08:57,011 --> 02:08:59,620
body.
Like that's what happens when people get

2842
02:08:59,621 --> 02:09:02,830
heart transplants and certain people
have said that they have certain weird

2843
02:09:02,831 --> 02:09:06,220
cravings and they think about things you
know,

2844
02:09:06,221 --> 02:09:10,000
that they never thought about before.
It's like you might be literally

2845
02:09:10,001 --> 02:09:11,920
interfacing with someone else's
memories,

2846
02:09:13,250 --> 02:09:15,760
imagined it in someone else's memories
in your body.

2847
02:09:16,420 --> 02:09:18,190
Like people that kick kidney
transplants.

2848
02:09:19,270 --> 02:09:20,920
How'd you get some memories along with
that and you're like,

2849
02:09:20,921 --> 02:09:24,670
what is this is a dream,
this is a dream or do I remember some

2850
02:09:24,671 --> 02:09:29,671
shit I did when I was five but it wasn't
me that Donald Donnie like think about

2851
02:09:31,031 --> 02:09:34,120
your memories of being five.
How fleeting,

2852
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:37,510
how,
how like barely visible.

2853
02:09:37,570 --> 02:09:40,480
How like in the darkest,
darkest,

2854
02:09:40,540 --> 02:09:45,540
darkest corner of what you could
possibly describe as a real memory in

2855
02:09:46,121 --> 02:09:51,070
terms of like being able to describe all
the everything around you that this is

2856
02:09:51,071 --> 02:09:53,230
like almost nothing.
They're almost nothing there.

2857
02:09:53,500 --> 02:09:56,650
Not to give that to somebody else.
Give that to somebody else and they have

2858
02:09:56,651 --> 02:09:59,200
that shit just bouncing around their
head and like,

2859
02:09:59,201 --> 02:10:04,201
am I crazy to really think this?
Is this a dream or it's the fucking

2860
02:10:05,660 --> 02:10:08,500
kidney,
I believe in that shit.

2861
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:12,640
Somebody else's DNA mixing with your
ors?

2862
02:10:12,910 --> 02:10:14,830
Well,
I think it's because of the heart thing

2863
02:10:14,831 --> 02:10:16,350
because it has neurons.
Yeah.

2864
02:10:16,720 --> 02:10:20,020
I mean they don't know,
right where memories are stored.

2865
02:10:20,080 --> 02:10:22,510
Do they,
do they know that for sure.

2866
02:10:23,710 --> 02:10:28,710
The question would be
every cell in your body reproduces

2867
02:10:30,040 --> 02:10:32,230
right.
Every cell in your body changes.

2868
02:10:32,231 --> 02:10:34,940
And over the course of seven to eight
years,

2869
02:10:35,510 --> 02:10:39,290
you essentially don't have any of the
same cells in your body except your

2870
02:10:39,291 --> 02:10:43,970
neurons.
Is that a urban legend or is that 100%

2871
02:10:43,971 --> 02:10:46,310
real light?
I think that's 100% real.

2872
02:10:47,030 --> 02:10:49,760
I think your body's cells change over.
Yeah.

2873
02:10:49,761 --> 02:10:51,650
I've always heard that the neurons do
not,

2874
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:53,810
you have the same neurons forever
apparently.

2875
02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:56,660
Yeah.
Which is,

2876
02:10:56,661 --> 02:10:59,300
um,
one of the more interesting things about

2877
02:10:59,301 --> 02:11:02,540
some of those neuroprotectant plants and
then,

2878
02:11:02,541 --> 02:11:04,700
um,
some certain funguses like what does it

2879
02:11:04,701 --> 02:11:08,840
lion's mane that promotes neuro
neurological health.

2880
02:11:10,020 --> 02:11:10,790
Yeah.
There's certain,

2881
02:11:10,790 --> 02:11:13,430
there's certain mushrooms that actually
are really good for your brain's

2882
02:11:13,431 --> 02:11:15,140
development.
It's really fascinating.

2883
02:11:15,490 --> 02:11:17,160
Hmm.
But,

2884
02:11:17,161 --> 02:11:17,900
um,
what's up?

2885
02:11:17,900 --> 02:11:19,160
I was just looking around.
They're all,

2886
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:21,440
every part of your body.
It grows at different rates,

2887
02:11:22,340 --> 02:11:25,500
but it over the course of eight years is
that they said that.

2888
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:25,911
Yeah.
I mean,

2889
02:11:25,911 --> 02:11:29,060
that's every eight years the whole
thing's changed over.

2890
02:11:29,480 --> 02:11:31,310
It's like you're a new person every
eight years.

2891
02:11:31,311 --> 02:11:32,480
Yeah,
but except your neurons,

2892
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:35,120
your neurons are where the memories are
stored.

2893
02:11:35,210 --> 02:11:38,390
That would kind of make sense.
But I think my theory,

2894
02:11:38,391 --> 02:11:41,090
and I'm a fucking,
I'm no scientist,

2895
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:46,360
but my theory is that memories that you
have are really just memories of how you

2896
02:11:46,401 --> 02:11:49,790
remember your memories that all of our
memories are like,

2897
02:11:49,791 --> 02:11:51,680
this is weird.
Whispery stories,

2898
02:11:51,681 --> 02:11:53,270
you know,
it's like a copy.

2899
02:11:54,490 --> 02:11:55,323
Okay.

2900
02:11:55,560 --> 02:11:56,393
Yeah.
Like I,

2901
02:11:57,870 --> 02:11:58,703
I just,

2902
02:12:00,070 --> 02:12:04,170
there's certain things that I've done in
my life where I'll look back and I'm

2903
02:12:04,310 --> 02:12:06,130
like,
I don't even really think that was me.

2904
02:12:07,180 --> 02:12:09,520
You know,
like the martial arts stuff particular,

2905
02:12:09,580 --> 02:12:13,030
I do not think that's me.
I think that that definitely wasn't me.

2906
02:12:13,270 --> 02:12:15,740
Yeah.
Or like even when I watch myself on news

2907
02:12:15,741 --> 02:12:16,990
radio,
I'm like,

2908
02:12:17,050 --> 02:12:19,780
that isn't even me.
I go watch like a youtube video on my

2909
02:12:19,781 --> 02:12:20,620
car,
doesn't even me.

2910
02:12:21,100 --> 02:12:23,960
I coat.
That's weird that,

2911
02:12:24,080 --> 02:12:26,950
that this is captured and for most
people,

2912
02:12:26,951 --> 02:12:31,000
most of their life right up until like
the last hundred or so years,

2913
02:12:31,240 --> 02:12:34,420
that was never an option.
It was never an option to go back and

2914
02:12:34,421 --> 02:12:37,990
look at yourself from 10 years ago or 20
years ago or 30 years ago.

2915
02:12:38,530 --> 02:12:43,530
But now it's super common place.
How much has that affected who people

2916
02:12:44,171 --> 02:12:46,660
are because you become so much more self
aware.

2917
02:12:46,990 --> 02:12:48,760
Right.
Remember that bit that I was doing last

2918
02:12:48,760 --> 02:12:50,380
year about like,
um,

2919
02:12:50,381 --> 02:12:52,870
I was doing my last netflix special
about the selfie.

2920
02:12:53,090 --> 02:12:57,790
I like somehow along the line people
change the way they pose it pictures.

2921
02:12:58,070 --> 02:12:59,470
It does.
You look at the first pictures.

2922
02:12:59,590 --> 02:13:01,000
People just stood there and looked
hungry.

2923
02:13:01,310 --> 02:13:03,700
I call holds pictures from the 18
hundreds.

2924
02:13:03,910 --> 02:13:06,310
They just look skinny and gaunt and
hungry.

2925
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:10,990
And if you saw a picture from like 1860
and there was a girl with her butt out

2926
02:13:10,991 --> 02:13:13,960
and she's doing duck lips,
feel like that pitch is a time traveler.

2927
02:13:14,260 --> 02:13:17,230
There's no way.
There's no way she could have been

2928
02:13:17,231 --> 02:13:19,840
there.
Like there's no way someone at that time

2929
02:13:20,020 --> 02:13:22,810
new to pout,
make kissy face and do the peace sign

2930
02:13:22,811 --> 02:13:25,270
and stick your ass out.
Just that's a pose.

2931
02:13:25,271 --> 02:13:27,580
That's um,
a modern pose.

2932
02:13:27,850 --> 02:13:31,500
And it came about because of being
extremely self conscious because so many

2933
02:13:31,501 --> 02:13:32,100
people,
I

2934
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:34,200
see images of themselves every,
I mean,

2935
02:13:34,620 --> 02:13:36,990
did he charge you Magii the grown
Jumanji they're really pretty.

2936
02:13:36,991 --> 02:13:39,030
Girl was obsessed with taking photos of
herself.

2937
02:13:39,270 --> 02:13:40,950
That's fucking really shit,
man.

2938
02:13:40,951 --> 02:13:43,260
Yeah,
so kids do right away.

2939
02:13:43,261 --> 02:13:46,680
One of the best movies,
surprisingly best movies I've seen in a

2940
02:13:46,681 --> 02:13:47,820
long time.
Fucking movie.

2941
02:13:47,850 --> 02:13:49,500
What a great take on it.
Yes,

2942
02:13:49,501 --> 02:13:50,430
I loved it.
Oh,

2943
02:13:50,431 --> 02:13:53,260
there's this cat time traveler.
Funny.

2944
02:13:53,340 --> 02:13:55,620
Is he a but yeah,
but that's how they lived back then.

2945
02:13:55,621 --> 02:13:58,560
He's probably drunk cause like,
well I've got to do shit like this.

2946
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:00,320
Okay.
Yeah.

2947
02:14:00,420 --> 02:14:02,400
That's how they look.
They look hungry,

2948
02:14:02,550 --> 02:14:03,750
man.
I just sticking it to the,

2949
02:14:03,810 --> 02:14:06,000
to her or him.
She's the one of them,

2950
02:14:07,130 --> 02:14:08,880
right?
Looks like that one actor that's in all

2951
02:14:08,890 --> 02:14:10,800
those.
Imagine being in a small cabin.

2952
02:14:10,801 --> 02:14:11,634
Go back up.
Please.

2953
02:14:11,670 --> 02:14:14,190
Imagine being in a small cabin with that
dude.

2954
02:14:14,191 --> 02:14:18,060
Just playing that stupid guitar and
singing these horrible songs was rotten.

2955
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:18,893
Shit.
Breath.

2956
02:14:20,070 --> 02:14:21,900
They didn't even,
they didn't even know what the fuck a

2957
02:14:21,901 --> 02:14:23,720
toothbrush was.
Right.

2958
02:14:23,770 --> 02:14:25,680
Your teeth just fell out of your fucking
head.

2959
02:14:25,681 --> 02:14:28,710
Like everybody else,
that guide below the box here,

2960
02:14:28,711 --> 02:14:31,350
it looks like it's not even like he's
trying to like be tough.

2961
02:14:31,351 --> 02:14:34,100
He's like,
I'm just doing a defense that's going to

2962
02:14:34,101 --> 02:14:35,020
lead away.
She,

2963
02:14:35,050 --> 02:14:39,090
I'm not even coming at Ya.
I'm coming at you with Dick First.

2964
02:14:40,860 --> 02:14:43,200
That's what they would do.
They would come at your Dick First.

2965
02:14:43,350 --> 02:14:45,060
Wow.
This thing looked like he knows how to

2966
02:14:45,061 --> 02:14:46,230
fight at all.
Well look away.

2967
02:14:46,231 --> 02:14:49,620
They would hold their hands up to,
they held their hands very differently.

2968
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:52,560
But um,
those fights were very different fights

2969
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:56,400
because they had real small gloves.
You couldn't get hit as much.

2970
02:14:56,880 --> 02:14:58,560
You couldn't hit each other as much
either.

2971
02:14:58,590 --> 02:15:01,710
Like you couldn't just like modern
boxing,

2972
02:15:01,890 --> 02:15:05,010
we just flowed with punches and got
crazy with punches.

2973
02:15:05,220 --> 02:15:06,690
You couldn't do that.
You'd break your hands.

2974
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:09,990
You had to be much more judicious with
where you hit people and they clinched a

2975
02:15:09,991 --> 02:15:11,690
lot.
Those old school boxes,

2976
02:15:11,691 --> 02:15:14,040
they would grab each other and wrestle
each other a lot and punch each other.

2977
02:15:14,041 --> 02:15:15,150
In the clinch,
there was a,

2978
02:15:15,151 --> 02:15:18,750
there was a lot more of that.
And there is now it's different world so

2979
02:15:18,751 --> 02:15:22,500
I guess they just cause it in heaven
like tiny gloves or no gloves.

2980
02:15:22,680 --> 02:15:26,100
They just decided they're going to try
to lean away from the punches more and

2981
02:15:26,101 --> 02:15:27,900
just kind of jab at each other with
knuckles.

2982
02:15:27,901 --> 02:15:30,900
You can't just wait in like um,
I mean you could if you were Mike Tyson,

2983
02:15:30,901 --> 02:15:33,600
but they just didn't,
they didn't know how to do it right back

2984
02:15:33,601 --> 02:15:35,580
then either.
Like even if you watch,

2985
02:15:36,570 --> 02:15:38,940
you go,
like if you watch modern boxing,

2986
02:15:38,941 --> 02:15:43,350
like you watch like Canelo Alvarez
versus Gennady Golovkin and you see like

2987
02:15:43,470 --> 02:15:45,900
the two,
two of the highest level guys in the

2988
02:15:45,901 --> 02:15:47,130
game go at each other.

2989
02:15:47,490 --> 02:15:50,670
It looks so much different than watching
like old school boxing.

2990
02:15:50,940 --> 02:15:54,000
Like old school boxing was like you had
sugar ray Robinson.

2991
02:15:54,001 --> 02:15:57,840
It was could have fought and been the
world champion today and then a bunch of

2992
02:15:57,841 --> 02:16:00,600
guys that he beat the shit out of.
And then you have a bunch of guys that

2993
02:16:00,601 --> 02:16:04,920
have like one kind of style and there's
inconsistencies in the greatness.

2994
02:16:05,490 --> 02:16:07,800
Like some of them look like,
like Marvin Hagler could have been a

2995
02:16:07,801 --> 02:16:10,980
world champion today.
And then other ones you go back like way

2996
02:16:10,981 --> 02:16:13,260
far back and you go,
hmm,

2997
02:16:13,290 --> 02:16:15,300
this guy's got like this weird fucking
style.

2998
02:16:15,301 --> 02:16:18,900
Like a wonder if the style is just
derived because of the little gloves and

2999
02:16:19,350 --> 02:16:21,180
they just didn't know as much about
boxing.

3000
02:16:21,181 --> 02:16:21,900
Then like,
watch,

3001
02:16:21,900 --> 02:16:23,910
go watch it like an old jim jefferies
fight.

3002
02:16:24,150 --> 02:16:26,100
And then imagine what Lennox Lewis would
do to him.

3003
02:16:26,460 --> 02:16:27,150
You know,
like there's,

3004
02:16:27,150 --> 02:16:29,410
there's levels that guy's got to where
they were just,

3005
02:16:29,550 --> 02:16:30,070
they were on

3006
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:33,880
another level,
like clearly who's that referee,

3007
02:16:33,881 --> 02:16:37,120
that boxing referee that it's been like
in a video lately on twitter that is

3008
02:16:37,121 --> 02:16:39,190
like the funniest shit.
I don't remember his name,

3009
02:16:39,191 --> 02:16:41,830
but I know what you're talking about.
Like loves his job and he's just in the

3010
02:16:41,831 --> 02:16:42,970
background.
You're like smiling.

3011
02:16:43,690 --> 02:16:45,460
Yeah,
it's hilarious.

3012
02:16:45,700 --> 02:16:46,840
I forget his name.
Uh,

3013
02:16:47,060 --> 02:16:50,530
this was a great video though.
Expressions are fucking hilarious.

3014
02:16:50,531 --> 02:16:52,570
Yeah.
Dudes get popped and he goes,

3015
02:16:52,620 --> 02:16:56,350
oh dude,
do boxing referee's ever go to the UFC

3016
02:16:56,380 --> 02:16:57,680
or this guy,
his name was Steve,

3017
02:16:57,940 --> 02:17:00,420
Steve Willis.
He will accept playlists.

3018
02:17:01,510 --> 02:17:03,430
I'll fix your,
I don't know why it's not playing.

3019
02:17:03,670 --> 02:17:08,650
Oh,
I usually just reload and that the whole

3020
02:17:08,651 --> 02:17:10,330
video is still video.
Oh,

3021
02:17:10,331 --> 02:17:13,360
it's a still video.
Oh,

3022
02:17:13,361 --> 02:17:15,670
that's probably what it is.
Uh,

3023
02:17:17,650 --> 02:17:18,820
he's a hilarious guy.

3024
02:17:21,010 --> 02:17:22,780
He gets very excited.
Yeah.

3025
02:17:23,650 --> 02:17:25,870
But these are good.
A good referee.

3026
02:17:26,050 --> 02:17:28,600
He's great.
And not just enthusiastic.

3027
02:17:28,601 --> 02:17:30,430
I mean,
that's a good thing to do to give a guy

3028
02:17:30,431 --> 02:17:32,170
a real clear eight count.
Oh,

3029
02:17:32,480 --> 02:17:35,680
got the best expressions.
Oh Shit.

3030
02:17:36,430 --> 02:17:38,260
Terrence Crawford,
terrence Crawford.

3031
02:17:38,290 --> 02:17:41,230
Beat your ass and then talk shit after
you get stopped.

3032
02:17:42,820 --> 02:17:45,280
You know,
terrence Crawford is one of the best

3033
02:17:45,281 --> 02:17:46,780
pound for pound fighters in the world.
Brian,

3034
02:17:47,530 --> 02:17:49,530
better learn.
I started to go beat yourself.

3035
02:17:49,540 --> 02:17:51,430
Learned.
What is that?

3036
02:17:52,860 --> 02:17:55,900
Oh,
connor talkers up open bed already and

3037
02:17:55,910 --> 02:17:58,990
make May.
Whether applying for MMA law license

3038
02:17:58,991 --> 02:18:01,900
wants six to eight months to train.
He's screwed.

3039
02:18:03,340 --> 02:18:05,440
This is a,
in my opinion,

3040
02:18:05,620 --> 02:18:10,620
this is a 40% proposition,
which means it's 40% likely that he

3041
02:18:10,841 --> 02:18:13,750
might actually do this.
The reason why he might do this is

3042
02:18:13,751 --> 02:18:17,920
because I think they will give him in on
godly som of money.

3043
02:18:18,220 --> 02:18:21,160
I mean an ungodly sum and I think they
should.

3044
02:18:21,640 --> 02:18:26,640
I think that if the UFC can talk,
floyd mayweather into going into an mma

3045
02:18:26,681 --> 02:18:27,910
ring,
first of all,

3046
02:18:28,210 --> 02:18:32,830
they should give him everything they can
get their greasy pause on to get them to

3047
02:18:32,831 --> 02:18:34,150
fight.
Conor and MMA fight.

3048
02:18:34,210 --> 02:18:34,900
Just say,
look,

3049
02:18:34,900 --> 02:18:38,080
we can give you cm punk will give you cm
punk for half of them.

3050
02:18:38,200 --> 02:18:41,050
Half a bill I half a billion.
It was a lot of money but you can go

3051
02:18:41,051 --> 02:18:45,730
through that in five years instead.
How about we give you conor mcgregor for

3052
02:18:45,731 --> 02:18:50,440
a full billy and we'll give you six to
eight months to practice Jiu Jitsu.

3053
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:55,000
Six six to eight months to just figure
out how you're going to get fucked up.

3054
02:18:55,030 --> 02:18:58,330
You'd be screwed.
He wouldn't just be screwed.

3055
02:18:58,331 --> 02:19:02,590
That's like,
that's unfair to like for people that

3056
02:19:02,591 --> 02:19:07,540
have been screwed.
You would need a way more way more

3057
02:19:07,570 --> 02:19:12,570
outrageous example.
It's not just getting screwed what he's,

3058
02:19:13,780 --> 02:19:18,780
he would like someone said it should be
a thousand to one that's not high

3059
02:19:18,791 --> 02:19:20,800
enough.
It's not high enough.

3060
02:19:20,890 --> 02:19:24,670
If conor mcgregor was going to fight
floyd mayweather in mma,

3061
02:19:24,671 --> 02:19:28,100
it is as close to 100%

3062
02:19:28,310 --> 02:19:31,970
as anything ever gets ever.
Cause if you think floyd is all of a

3063
02:19:31,971 --> 02:19:36,971
sudden going to become this
fucking one punch destroyer like John

3064
02:19:39,531 --> 02:19:42,320
the bees Mugabi in the 1980s or wherever
the fuck that was,

3065
02:19:42,530 --> 02:19:44,120
if you think that's going to happen out
of nowhere,

3066
02:19:44,121 --> 02:19:46,340
you're crazy.
That's not what's going to happen.

3067
02:19:46,490 --> 02:19:49,880
What's going to happen is he's probably
gonna Punch Connor in the face a couple

3068
02:19:49,881 --> 02:19:51,890
of times.
It's probably going to suck,

3069
02:19:52,160 --> 02:19:56,240
but Khan is going to get ahold of him
and then he's going to be like a baby.

3070
02:19:56,600 --> 02:19:59,840
And if that doesn't happen,
he'll kick floyd's legs out from under

3071
02:19:59,841 --> 02:20:02,450
him.
He'll kick his legs sideways,

3072
02:20:02,451 --> 02:20:05,210
he'll kick them from the outside,
will kick them from the inside.

3073
02:20:05,390 --> 02:20:10,070
He'll stay way the fuck away from any
sort of arrange where floyd can punch

3074
02:20:10,071 --> 02:20:12,350
him.
It'll be a completely alien range for

3075
02:20:12,351 --> 02:20:15,110
floyd.
And every time floyd goes in front kick

3076
02:20:15,111 --> 02:20:16,190
to the stomach,
boom,

3077
02:20:16,191 --> 02:20:17,720
front kick to the stomach,
boom,

3078
02:20:17,840 --> 02:20:18,830
front kick to the stomach.

3079
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:20,810
How many of those can you take?
Okay,

3080
02:20:20,811 --> 02:20:22,220
boom.
Inside leg kick.

3081
02:20:22,221 --> 02:20:24,890
Boehm outside leg kick.
He's laughing at you now.

3082
02:20:24,980 --> 02:20:27,590
Now he's talking Shit and you realize
you've got to get past those legs.

3083
02:20:27,800 --> 02:20:29,430
You could try to close the distance.
Boom,

3084
02:20:29,431 --> 02:20:30,710
spinning back,
kick to the liver.

3085
02:20:30,890 --> 02:20:33,140
Fuck.
What are you going to do now?

3086
02:20:33,170 --> 02:20:36,290
What are you gonna do now?
You're going to be picked apart until he

3087
02:20:36,291 --> 02:20:39,860
decides to take you to the ground and
cut your face open with elbows.

3088
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:43,220
How about that?
How about he pins your right arm down

3089
02:20:43,221 --> 02:20:46,370
with his left Shin,
gets on top of you and just start

3090
02:20:46,371 --> 02:20:50,150
smashing the edge of the elbow into your
eye sockets,

3091
02:20:50,270 --> 02:20:54,080
into your nose,
cuts across your forehead slices you

3092
02:20:54,081 --> 02:20:58,280
opened like a fucking melon.
You don't have a chance.

3093
02:20:58,340 --> 02:21:03,340
No one has a chance that hasn't had a
long history of grappling and getting

3094
02:21:03,951 --> 02:21:04,784
kicked.

3095
02:21:05,240 --> 02:21:09,770
It's like you're a regular boxer is like
especially the best ever like floyd.

3096
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:14,920
It's phenomenal at what he does,
but if you put takedowns and kicks into

3097
02:21:15,230 --> 02:21:16,011
that,
it changes.

3098
02:21:16,011 --> 02:21:18,170
Everything,
changes everything.

3099
02:21:19,010 --> 02:21:21,350
He'd be fucked.
I wonder if he's done any training at

3100
02:21:21,351 --> 02:21:22,490
all.
Well,

3101
02:21:22,491 --> 02:21:27,440
I know these talk to Tyron Woodley and
Tyron Woodley was a apparently willing

3102
02:21:27,441 --> 02:21:29,960
to help him prepare.
That would be very interesting because

3103
02:21:29,961 --> 02:21:33,200
Willie's had some issues with connor.
I don't think he's going to fight conor

3104
02:21:33,201 --> 02:21:35,720
though.
I think if he does choose to fight mma,

3105
02:21:35,990 --> 02:21:40,730
I really believe the move is the correct
move is you fight someone like cm punk.

3106
02:21:41,270 --> 02:21:45,470
Cause with cm you got a guy who's,
he's been training in mma for a long

3107
02:21:45,471 --> 02:21:46,880
time now.
It's been a few years,

3108
02:21:46,881 --> 02:21:48,380
not a long time,
but a few years now.

3109
02:21:48,381 --> 02:21:52,550
He had one mma fight in the UFC but was
very overmatched it.

3110
02:21:52,550 --> 02:21:56,600
We really wasn't fair like for him.
Didn't make it that kid.

3111
02:21:57,080 --> 02:22:00,110
I mean it's just the difference between
the two of them.

3112
02:22:00,560 --> 02:22:04,850
You know,
Micky Gall is a real professional elite

3113
02:22:04,851 --> 02:22:08,490
fighter.
I mean he can beat really good guys and

3114
02:22:09,140 --> 02:22:12,090
he's just not in that world.
Like cm pucks,

3115
02:22:12,110 --> 02:22:16,700
a 40 year old guy who is a professional
entertainer who is basically a beginner.

3116
02:22:16,840 --> 02:22:20,300
Right.
But he knows enough where you would,

3117
02:22:20,390 --> 02:22:23,710
we would bet money on him.
He knows enough where you're like,

3118
02:22:23,711 --> 02:22:28,470
imagine if cm punk who is a big guy,
he cuts down to one 70 and compare it to

3119
02:22:28,471 --> 02:22:31,800
floyd floyd's fight it like,
I think he fought it started this

3120
02:22:31,810 --> 02:22:36,510
career.
I want to say one 31 35 we'll go to

3121
02:22:36,511 --> 02:22:40,140
floyd mayweather's beginning fights,
see what,

3122
02:22:40,620 --> 02:22:45,330
but at the very least he's definitely
fought at one 45 as a grown man.

3123
02:22:45,510 --> 02:22:48,800
He's fought at one 55
cm punk,

3124
02:22:48,810 --> 02:22:49,530
way bigger.

3125
02:22:49,530 --> 02:22:52,470
He's just a way bigger guy.
So if he could figure out a way to get

3126
02:22:52,471 --> 02:22:56,340
to fight to the ground and like lock in
something simple like a guillotine,

3127
02:22:56,610 --> 02:22:59,130
if he has a good Ghia teen,
that's what I would say.

3128
02:22:59,250 --> 02:23:01,050
If I was going to work with a guy like
that,

3129
02:23:01,051 --> 02:23:03,090
I would say you're going to come,
we're going to concentrate on one

3130
02:23:03,210 --> 02:23:07,440
fucking choke and we're going to get
that thing down to like laser beam.

3131
02:23:08,040 --> 02:23:12,480
Perfect precision.
So just if you just spent all your time

3132
02:23:12,481 --> 02:23:15,600
doing like one Marcello Garcia style
choke,

3133
02:23:15,601 --> 02:23:20,280
just figured out one good show,
one where you know that if you get that

3134
02:23:20,340 --> 02:23:24,390
Chin down,
you tuck it in and slap it on one choke,

3135
02:23:24,391 --> 02:23:28,440
whatever it is that you know how to
close that fucker up 90% of the time on

3136
02:23:28,441 --> 02:23:31,080
people that know how to defend.
There's a lot of guys that have that

3137
02:23:31,081 --> 02:23:34,530
like maybe they'd have a triangle or
maybe they have a head in our head and

3138
02:23:34,531 --> 02:23:35,490
arm choke is a good one.

3139
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:38,880
That's a good one to master.
Some guy just finished most people with

3140
02:23:38,881 --> 02:23:42,990
like that one choke if he just had that
and just got fully to the ground and

3141
02:23:42,991 --> 02:23:46,740
just got his neck.
It's super super possible that he could

3142
02:23:46,741 --> 02:23:51,060
win like it's possible that he could win
but it's also possible the floyd can

3143
02:23:51,061 --> 02:23:53,190
win.
That's what makes that interesting cause

3144
02:23:53,191 --> 02:23:56,460
floyd is still one of the best boxers of
all time if not the best,

3145
02:23:56,580 --> 02:24:01,180
still a fucking elite athlete.
Still light speed in the,

3146
02:24:01,181 --> 02:24:03,270
in there,
like with his footwork and his movement,

3147
02:24:03,271 --> 02:24:05,550
his head movement,
he's so fast,

3148
02:24:05,850 --> 02:24:09,780
he's going to be way faster and cm punk.
So if cm punk can't get ahold of them,

3149
02:24:09,900 --> 02:24:13,620
and every time he moves in,
he gets his face lit up with a dude

3150
02:24:13,621 --> 02:24:16,200
who's fast as fuck with six ounce
gloves.

3151
02:24:16,201 --> 02:24:19,170
Now he's got four ounce gloves on,
very little padding and he's catching

3152
02:24:19,171 --> 02:24:22,440
you right on the chin and you can't do
shit about it.

3153
02:24:22,441 --> 02:24:24,090
You're trying to close the distance and
he stutter,

3154
02:24:24,091 --> 02:24:27,660
step in and move it in front of you and
cm punk is not like the best kicker in

3155
02:24:27,661 --> 02:24:31,110
the world.
I'll buy it,

3156
02:24:31,500 --> 02:24:32,333
I'll buy it.

3157
02:24:32,940 --> 02:24:34,940
Okay.
But he'll have to fight me.

3158
02:24:34,941 --> 02:24:39,290
Whether if he comes to mma that would,
you mean you'd have to fight,

3159
02:24:39,310 --> 02:24:40,143
um,
or uh,

3160
02:24:40,340 --> 02:24:41,690
connor connor?
No.

3161
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:42,673
No,
you wouldn't.

3162
02:24:42,770 --> 02:24:44,720
You don't think so.
He'd get killed.

3163
02:24:44,870 --> 02:24:47,930
He would literally get killed.
I know,

3164
02:24:47,931 --> 02:24:50,450
but that he would get smashed.
She ends up doing it my may.

3165
02:24:50,451 --> 02:24:51,820
You know,
everyone wants to see that though.

3166
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:53,450
That's what everybody wants to see.
For sure.

3167
02:24:53,451 --> 02:24:55,960
Rhonda and him fight.
That would be a good one.

3168
02:24:57,090 --> 02:24:59,900
Yeah.
Um,

3169
02:24:59,970 --> 02:25:03,630
I don't think he's going to do it.
I don't think he's gonna Fight Mcgregor

3170
02:25:03,631 --> 02:25:06,090
ever and mma,
but I think you might fight cm punk.

3171
02:25:06,450 --> 02:25:08,130
I believe that.
I believe that could happen.

3172
02:25:08,131 --> 02:25:11,400
I know they're not even,
that's not even like official talk,

3173
02:25:11,850 --> 02:25:14,760
but I really believe that can happen.
It sounds crazy.

3174
02:25:14,761 --> 02:25:17,220
I know,
but the whole thing sounds crazy.

3175
02:25:17,250 --> 02:25:21,360
It sounds crazy to think that he could
fight anybody in mma that he would be

3176
02:25:21,361 --> 02:25:23,860
willing to do it.
He must know something

3177
02:25:25,330 --> 02:25:28,840
because he could just go into boxing.
He must know that he's his time as a

3178
02:25:28,841 --> 02:25:29,980
boxer.
It's just done.

3179
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:32,860
Who Cares?
You have enough money to do what you

3180
02:25:32,861 --> 02:25:33,671
want to do,
dude,

3181
02:25:33,671 --> 02:25:35,410
you don't understand.
You don't ball that way.

3182
02:25:36,010 --> 02:25:39,490
You know ball like you balls.
He's balling on a level that neither of

3183
02:25:39,491 --> 02:25:42,340
us could ever understand how much money
you have to spend.

3184
02:25:42,341 --> 02:25:46,360
Just fly everywhere in private chats and
have limos everywhere you go and have

3185
02:25:46,390 --> 02:25:48,910
five bentleys and six Ferrari's and all
the shit.

3186
02:25:48,930 --> 02:25:52,300
That guy has so much money it takes to
maintain that lifestyle.

3187
02:25:52,630 --> 02:25:55,370
And then he's got a strip club and he's
got a giant mansion.

3188
02:25:55,400 --> 02:25:58,720
He's got a bunch of people working for
him all the time and he spends on

3189
02:25:58,721 --> 02:26:01,030
everything.
That dude buys half million dollar

3190
02:26:01,031 --> 02:26:03,220
watches.
He's just always buying shit.

3191
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:07,630
He buys the most ridiculous shit and
puts it on his instagram

3192
02:26:09,220 --> 02:26:13,930
and gamble's like crazy,
crazy gambling like bet $1 million on a

3193
02:26:14,110 --> 02:26:15,400
fucking basketball game.

3194
02:26:16,300 --> 02:26:18,190
Yo,
I dunno,

3195
02:26:19,630 --> 02:26:21,400
I don't pay attention dude.
I got shit to do.

3196
02:26:22,710 --> 02:26:25,750
Believe that the money team time piece,
Oh shit.

3197
02:26:25,751 --> 02:26:30,751
Look at that tmt Hubo time pieces.
We'll only appreciate and value.

3198
02:26:30,880 --> 02:26:35,770
Go to your nearest tube load boutique
and shop right now for my limited

3199
02:26:35,771 --> 02:26:40,360
edition shoe below Hashtag [inaudible]
Hashtag tmt the money team.

3200
02:26:40,361 --> 02:26:43,300
Go back to that again.
Please look at that fucking watch man

3201
02:26:43,390 --> 02:26:45,190
with a diamonds in that bitch.
Ooh,

3202
02:26:45,490 --> 02:26:49,900
if you want to let bitches know that you
got some real shitty taste in jewelry

3203
02:26:49,901 --> 02:26:53,260
and a lot of disposable income,
look at that thing that's pretty

3204
02:26:53,290 --> 02:26:55,240
actually ethnic.
That's better than the other one.

3205
02:26:55,241 --> 02:26:58,090
But the whole tmt thing,
who the fuck's buying that?

3206
02:26:58,600 --> 02:27:02,500
Who's going to buy another man's like
braggadocious logo?

3207
02:27:02,650 --> 02:27:04,480
I see on a watch.
Not on a watch,

3208
02:27:04,481 --> 02:27:06,370
but I,
I when you go to sporting events I

3209
02:27:06,410 --> 02:27:10,930
suppose whereas a tee shirt,
maybe I get that big fan of what the

3210
02:27:10,931 --> 02:27:11,440
guy's done.

3211
02:27:11,440 --> 02:27:13,990
You see the selfie he posted,
I said Nice Romantic,

3212
02:27:14,660 --> 02:27:16,020
beautiful,
handsome man.

3213
02:27:16,030 --> 02:27:19,300
Kind of hashtags are saying on their
early morning sophie or early morning

3214
02:27:19,301 --> 02:27:20,290
selfie.
All right.

3215
02:27:20,620 --> 02:27:22,620
Thank you.
Glad you did.

3216
02:27:22,960 --> 02:27:25,030
Hey look man,
he's a silly fella,

3217
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:27,550
but he's also the greatest boxer of all
time.

3218
02:27:27,670 --> 02:27:30,910
He's also unbelievably physically
talented isolation or uh,

3219
02:27:31,160 --> 02:27:32,920
so that's uh,
cryo.

3220
02:27:32,980 --> 02:27:34,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

3221
02:27:34,061 --> 02:27:35,680
He's got,
he's got to learn about the one where

3222
02:27:35,681 --> 02:27:36,880
your whole head gives under.
Yeah.

3223
02:27:36,881 --> 02:27:38,290
Is that better?
That they'll feel better?

3224
02:27:38,650 --> 02:27:40,030
Yeah,
it's way better.

3225
02:27:40,660 --> 02:27:41,261
Okay.
We'll see.

3226
02:27:41,261 --> 02:27:42,820
Seen enough money,
team jewelry,

3227
02:27:43,390 --> 02:27:46,680
but he's got millions of dollars and
just jewelry to,

3228
02:27:46,690 --> 02:27:47,740
it's very interesting,
man.

3229
02:27:47,980 --> 02:27:50,680
It's very interesting because what he is
is like a,

3230
02:27:51,280 --> 02:27:56,280
he's the most like braggy showy,
like a rich,

3231
02:27:56,830 --> 02:27:58,420
rich type guy.
And because of that,

3232
02:27:58,421 --> 02:28:01,060
people go to see him fight,
hoping he's going to lose,

3233
02:28:01,061 --> 02:28:04,930
and he always wins.
It's genius way to make yourself

3234
02:28:04,931 --> 02:28:08,350
exciting because he has a really smart
boxing style.

3235
02:28:08,420 --> 02:28:12,340
I like his style is extremely defensive.
Like he's one of the best defensive

3236
02:28:12,341 --> 02:28:14,560
boxers,
if not the best of all time.

3237
02:28:14,740 --> 02:28:18,850
It's very hard to hit.
So when he's boxing and he's like hardly

3238
02:28:18,851 --> 02:28:21,980
ever getting hit and winning decisions,
like there's gotta be a

3239
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:23,840
way to get people to keep coming to
these fights.

3240
02:28:23,870 --> 02:28:28,400
And this is the way everybody like
rooting against you have ever.

3241
02:28:28,410 --> 02:28:30,050
But look at all this money.
You ain't got shit.

3242
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:31,670
Look at all my money.
Look at this car.

3243
02:28:31,671 --> 02:28:32,770
Look at this house.
Ooh.

3244
02:28:36,110 --> 02:28:39,230
It's kind of funny.
Brian Red Band Peters out at about an

3245
02:28:39,260 --> 02:28:42,440
hour and two hours and 40 minutes and
that's about all you got.

3246
02:28:42,550 --> 02:28:45,590
Now
it's everybody.

3247
02:28:45,950 --> 02:28:47,660
Everybody gets tired.
Except Kurt Metzger.

3248
02:28:47,870 --> 02:28:50,930
We had Kurt Metzger on yesterday.
He had 150 red bulls.

3249
02:28:51,350 --> 02:28:55,960
He had 16 different caveman coffee
nitros how many did he have while we

3250
02:28:55,961 --> 02:28:56,990
were here?
He had at least two.

3251
02:28:57,020 --> 02:28:57,621
I think he,
yeah,

3252
02:28:57,621 --> 02:28:59,900
he walked in and drink and one,
I think he had two more early on and a

3253
02:28:59,901 --> 02:29:00,440
half.
At least.

3254
02:29:00,440 --> 02:29:04,490
He had three total and a poor.
Oh and Benjamin got talked over.

3255
02:29:04,491 --> 02:29:09,491
So go to huge penis.com and check out
owens a new special that he released.

3256
02:29:09,620 --> 02:29:13,070
He shot it,
filled it himself and released it on his

3257
02:29:13,071 --> 02:29:15,710
website,
which is huge pianist because he's huge.

3258
02:29:15,820 --> 02:29:18,260
I just forget how big he is.
He said when he came in here and gave me

3259
02:29:18,261 --> 02:29:19,760
a hug yesterday,
I was like a little kid.

3260
02:29:19,970 --> 02:29:21,890
I'm dick hide on him.
He's six,

3261
02:29:21,891 --> 02:29:23,060
seven.
He's six,

3262
02:29:23,061 --> 02:29:25,850
seven.
He's almost a foot taller than me.

3263
02:29:25,910 --> 02:29:29,930
That's crazy.
He's a giant human in a big barrel.

3264
02:29:30,110 --> 02:29:31,940
Fucking,
and then I think he's gotten bigger

3265
02:29:31,941 --> 02:29:33,440
since he's moved to the woods.
Oh yeah.

3266
02:29:33,830 --> 02:29:36,380
Cause he's been upstate New York.
I feel like he's grown.

3267
02:29:37,070 --> 02:29:40,070
It just seems like he's like fitting
into the environment.

3268
02:29:40,071 --> 02:29:42,110
You know,
this is a thing that animals do in the

3269
02:29:42,111 --> 02:29:43,190
colder,
uh,

3270
02:29:43,970 --> 02:29:47,640
the colder parts of their reach or
their,

3271
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:49,190
where they are,
where they roam.

3272
02:29:49,530 --> 02:29:51,770
Um,
they get larger.

3273
02:29:52,910 --> 02:29:56,270
So like if an animal in the range,
that's the word I was looking for.

3274
02:29:56,450 --> 02:30:00,960
Like if an animal has a winter range or
an animal has like a like say like white

3275
02:30:00,961 --> 02:30:03,380
tail deer,
like a whitetail deer in Florida is real

3276
02:30:03,381 --> 02:30:04,910
tiny thing.
We only have a hundred pounds.

3277
02:30:05,350 --> 02:30:07,490
You go to a whitetail deer in
Saskatchewan,

3278
02:30:07,590 --> 02:30:09,860
they were like 300 pounds.
They're huge.

3279
02:30:10,070 --> 02:30:13,430
They're giant ass fucking deer.
And that's like as big as a white tail

3280
02:30:13,431 --> 02:30:15,350
deer gets.
And they di they look massive.

3281
02:30:15,650 --> 02:30:18,980
They're just a different animal.
It's because when the colder climates,

3282
02:30:19,340 --> 02:30:22,040
they have to have more body mass to stay
warm.

3283
02:30:22,280 --> 02:30:25,640
That's why polar bears are the biggest
fucking bears called polar bears.

3284
02:30:25,641 --> 02:30:27,800
And then Kodiak Grizzlies I think are
also,

3285
02:30:28,340 --> 02:30:30,560
they're pretty close.
But the Kodiak Brown bears,

3286
02:30:30,561 --> 02:30:32,030
it's just because there's salmon
everywhere.

3287
02:30:32,031 --> 02:30:34,490
They're just feasting these fucking
monsters.

3288
02:30:36,020 --> 02:30:40,520
Do your feet grow the older you got?
Because when I've gone up like from like

3289
02:30:40,850 --> 02:30:44,160
10 to like now,
almost 12 he takes can't vary too.

3290
02:30:44,160 --> 02:30:46,940
Maybe.
So it's Dick Pills and it was idea.

3291
02:30:48,740 --> 02:30:50,270
That's a good move to,
um,

3292
02:30:50,420 --> 02:30:51,500
I think that,
uh,

3293
02:30:51,560 --> 02:30:53,090
what you're carrying around a lot of
weight,

3294
02:30:54,280 --> 02:30:55,970
you know,
you think about what you weigh and how

3295
02:30:55,971 --> 02:30:58,670
many times your feet are walking around,
I would imagine.

3296
02:30:59,240 --> 02:31:01,880
But you didn't your,
you're just in a am I did a half size,

3297
02:31:01,881 --> 02:31:04,310
half size.
I used to be a 10 and a half and then

3298
02:31:04,311 --> 02:31:09,311
somewhere around 30 ish.
My Shit was like getting cramped in a 10

3299
02:31:09,981 --> 02:31:11,960
and a half.
Then I moved to an 11.

3300
02:31:12,020 --> 02:31:14,390
Yeah.
Although I have found recently that 10

3301
02:31:14,391 --> 02:31:19,070
and a half fits better for me in those
five finger shoes for whatever reason.

3302
02:31:19,950 --> 02:31:20,070
I

3303
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:22,730
think I had one.
I think one of them might just getting

3304
02:31:22,890 --> 02:31:25,110
stretched out a little bit.
They just get,

3305
02:31:25,780 --> 02:31:27,360
I beat the fuck out of those things.
You know,

3306
02:31:27,361 --> 02:31:31,680
I'm taking those things on these serious
hills and they get stretched out.

3307
02:31:31,950 --> 02:31:33,930
You're working out now,
what are you doing?

3308
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:36,700
Uh,
30 to 40 minutes of Cardio and then

3309
02:31:36,710 --> 02:31:40,550
about 20 minutes of weights.
But I just did this new step cardio

3310
02:31:40,551 --> 02:31:42,890
thing by mistake the other day and
killed me.

3311
02:31:43,100 --> 02:31:45,890
Like the ones where you're kind of
climbing up stairs while doing,

3312
02:31:46,370 --> 02:31:47,380
they looked at movie.
Yeah.

3313
02:31:47,390 --> 02:31:48,440
Yeah,
I've seen that one.

3314
02:31:48,441 --> 02:31:49,274
Yeah,
you're not that.

3315
02:31:49,790 --> 02:31:52,940
I did it for like 35 minutes,
which is normal,

3316
02:31:52,941 --> 02:31:55,970
but man,
it broke me like I'm in so much pain

3317
02:31:55,971 --> 02:31:56,540
right now.

3318
02:31:56,540 --> 02:31:57,890
Yeah,
your muscles get sore,

3319
02:31:57,891 --> 02:31:59,840
but that's good.
That means you're doing something that's

3320
02:31:59,841 --> 02:32:00,720
difficult.
Yeah,

3321
02:32:01,240 --> 02:32:02,800
no.
Well just saying Janet,

3322
02:32:02,801 --> 02:32:04,760
one Albert's doing today.
Birds dead.

3323
02:32:04,761 --> 02:32:06,020
Walking around.
Yeah,

3324
02:32:06,021 --> 02:32:08,090
he's hurting.
He was saying that he's super sore.

3325
02:32:08,780 --> 02:32:10,940
Wow.
I mean he's,

3326
02:32:11,060 --> 02:32:12,380
yeah,
he's a silly boy,

3327
02:32:13,280 --> 02:32:15,560
but hey,
that was great that he did that.

3328
02:32:15,561 --> 02:32:17,330
It's good that he did and he really
didn't.

3329
02:32:17,480 --> 02:32:20,240
I mean it didn't like specifically
prepare for it where he's doing like

3330
02:32:20,241 --> 02:32:22,970
half marathons all the time.
You just got over being sick for two

3331
02:32:22,971 --> 02:32:24,410
weeks.
Just went to a cryo place.

3332
02:32:24,420 --> 02:32:28,760
Looks like for some help
out of control.

3333
02:32:29,860 --> 02:32:30,171
Oh,
he,

3334
02:32:30,171 --> 02:32:32,900
so he went to crowd healthcare now an
probably 20 minutes ago.

3335
02:32:33,020 --> 02:32:33,830
Oh,
okay.

3336
02:32:33,830 --> 02:32:34,910
Which one?
That looks like,

3337
02:32:35,090 --> 02:32:36,080
I don't know.
Which one that is.

3338
02:32:36,140 --> 02:32:40,820
There's a few of those places now.
Do you think that is a fad or do you

3339
02:32:40,821 --> 02:32:42,560
think this is going to,
you know,

3340
02:32:42,890 --> 02:32:44,240
Bert?
No crap.

3341
02:32:47,610 --> 02:32:48,350
No,
no.

3342
02:32:48,350 --> 02:32:50,390
There's real benefits.
If it feels good,

3343
02:32:50,660 --> 02:32:52,370
it feels really good when you get out
like your,

3344
02:32:52,400 --> 02:32:56,930
your body feels good and it's because of
your brain produces really strong

3345
02:32:56,931 --> 02:32:58,490
chemicals when you were in there because
it's,

3346
02:32:58,520 --> 02:32:59,211
you know,
it's going,

3347
02:32:59,211 --> 02:33:00,480
Holy Shit.
We're dying.

3348
02:33:00,490 --> 02:33:02,090
The producers,
cold shock proteins,

3349
02:33:02,091 --> 02:33:06,140
what they call them and uh,
and it also produces a nor epinephrin,

3350
02:33:06,440 --> 02:33:08,960
which is like a version of adrenaline
that's,

3351
02:33:08,961 --> 02:33:11,740
or as a cousin of adrenaline.
Isn't that how they described it?

3352
02:33:11,741 --> 02:33:12,501
Yeah.
Yeah.

3353
02:33:12,501 --> 02:33:13,520
Epinephrin is adrenaline.

3354
02:33:13,560 --> 02:33:17,640
Joey Diaz just did it the other day.
This is about the kind of air

3355
02:33:17,641 --> 02:33:18,690
conditioning I want in my house.

3356
02:33:18,930 --> 02:33:22,460
Ah.
We would go into his hotel room when we

3357
02:33:22,461 --> 02:33:25,000
would go on the road with Joey and we'd
open up the door and be like,

3358
02:33:25,001 --> 02:33:28,750
Jesus Christ fucking penguins or waddled
around inside of his room,

3359
02:33:28,780 --> 02:33:30,580
50 degrees,
whatever.

3360
02:33:30,581 --> 02:33:33,190
That when there was a slider and you can
get over to the blue,

3361
02:33:33,310 --> 02:33:37,930
that shit would be pegged like at the
coldest it could possibly get that thing

3362
02:33:37,931 --> 02:33:39,400
never shut off.
Yeah,

3363
02:33:39,510 --> 02:33:44,510
no it does in room ones that would kick
on the real loud and you're like,

3364
02:33:44,530 --> 02:33:49,530
no spray on you daughter.
The worst is when they go on and off

3365
02:33:49,661 --> 02:33:52,570
intermittently in the night and wake you
up in the middle of the night.

3366
02:33:55,030 --> 02:33:58,690
When we were at the Detroit fillmore,
they were talking about how men used to

3367
02:33:58,691 --> 02:34:00,590
come in there during,
you know,

3368
02:34:00,591 --> 02:34:03,010
like whatever the fuck year it was when
they invented this,

3369
02:34:03,011 --> 02:34:05,710
um,
where they built this amazing theater in

3370
02:34:05,711 --> 02:34:07,030
Detroit,
but it was the,

3371
02:34:07,060 --> 02:34:09,130
one of the first places in town,
they've got air conditioning.

3372
02:34:09,460 --> 02:34:13,690
So people would buy a ticket just to
come in and sleep because it was so hot

3373
02:34:13,691 --> 02:34:16,060
in the summertime.
And then they'd go there and they'd be

3374
02:34:16,061 --> 02:34:17,400
like,
ah.

3375
02:34:17,730 --> 02:34:21,890
He would just sit there
snore at,

3376
02:34:21,940 --> 02:34:22,481
that's how I,
like,

3377
02:34:22,481 --> 02:34:25,600
my gym has 24 hour fitness.
Do you have fucking homeless people will

3378
02:34:25,601 --> 02:34:29,350
live in their showers there.
That's what people do,

3379
02:34:29,351 --> 02:34:30,670
right?
If they want to live out of their car,

3380
02:34:30,671 --> 02:34:35,110
they get a 24 hour fitness membership.
So I like going late at night.

3381
02:34:35,111 --> 02:34:38,050
Like sometimes we'll go like at one in
the morning and then you just like,

3382
02:34:38,051 --> 02:34:39,640
why is there so many people here?
Oh,

3383
02:34:39,641 --> 02:34:43,220
all these people are homeless or to
sleep.

3384
02:34:43,260 --> 02:34:43,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

3385
02:34:43,950 --> 02:34:46,600
Where do you sleep if you're homeless?
Car Cars.

3386
02:34:46,830 --> 02:34:48,070
I have a car,
but that's not,

3387
02:34:48,120 --> 02:34:48,911
that's,
let's see,

3388
02:34:48,911 --> 02:34:50,200
I just think there's homeless and then
there's,

3389
02:34:50,201 --> 02:34:51,550
I've got a car homeless.
Hey.

3390
02:34:51,730 --> 02:34:52,411
It's like Damn,
look,

3391
02:34:52,411 --> 02:34:54,270
guy's a pimp.
And I was like,

3392
02:34:54,310 --> 02:34:55,240
that's the next level

3393
02:34:56,430 --> 02:35:00,390
video that's out right now about this
guy who was an ultra marathon runner.

3394
02:35:00,391 --> 02:35:02,280
He's 76 years old.
See if you could find,

3395
02:35:02,281 --> 02:35:04,860
I found it on dig.
It's called the most elusive man in

3396
02:35:04,861 --> 02:35:08,460
North America.
And this dude has a school bus that he

3397
02:35:08,461 --> 02:35:12,090
lives in.
He parked the school bus in the woods

3398
02:35:12,300 --> 02:35:16,350
and he just runs every day and they're
all like looking for this guy.

3399
02:35:17,310 --> 02:35:22,290
I want to say he's like 78 years old.
Does it say

3400
02:35:24,320 --> 02:35:28,890
76 76 years old.
He's 76 years old and he runs ultra

3401
02:35:28,891 --> 02:35:31,370
marathons and this guy lives in the
forest.

3402
02:35:31,371 --> 02:35:33,460
You got to go way till they find them
these,

3403
02:35:33,540 --> 02:35:36,960
they had to go and seek this guy out and
do these interviews with him.

3404
02:35:38,820 --> 02:35:43,820
There he is right there.
And so all he does is drink beer and run

3405
02:35:45,650 --> 02:35:48,240
and eat food.
And I think he lives by himself and he

3406
02:35:48,241 --> 02:35:49,800
lives in this tiny little thing.

3407
02:35:50,040 --> 02:35:53,940
And but what's fascinating is when you
talk to him,

3408
02:35:54,420 --> 02:35:56,730
when you sit and listen to the guy talk,
you'd go,

3409
02:35:56,760 --> 02:36:01,470
oh well this is a very intelligent man
and he just finds what he likes.

3410
02:36:01,471 --> 02:36:05,070
What he likes to do is create trails.
So he makes his own trails in the woods.

3411
02:36:05,310 --> 02:36:08,140
He knocks over sticks and move stuff
aside and,

3412
02:36:08,220 --> 02:36:12,450
and creates a path so that he could use
it over and over again and,

3413
02:36:12,650 --> 02:36:15,840
and just runs all the time.
It's just constantly pushing himself.

3414
02:36:15,841 --> 02:36:20,430
But he's talking about challenging
himself in the things that he does.

3415
02:36:20,431 --> 02:36:23,430
And why does it mean he doesn't need
anything more than this bus to live in

3416
02:36:23,760 --> 02:36:25,980
and he's just,
he's not.

3417
02:36:26,220 --> 02:36:28,110
See the thing is,
you would see someone like that and you

3418
02:36:28,111 --> 02:36:29,280
dismiss them and you'd go,
well,

3419
02:36:29,281 --> 02:36:31,410
that guy is a fool,
but he's not a fool.

3420
02:36:31,560 --> 02:36:33,330
And you listen to him talk and you go,
okay,

3421
02:36:33,600 --> 02:36:36,930
so this is his philosophy behind this.
These got,

3422
02:36:37,140 --> 02:36:40,830
he's really thought this out to the
point where he's become very comfortable

3423
02:36:40,831 --> 02:36:45,110
just living in this bus in the middle of
the forest and he looks good for a guy

3424
02:36:45,111 --> 02:36:48,270
who's 76 who runs hundreds of miles.
I mean,

3425
02:36:48,271 --> 02:36:49,680
he looks sexy.
Santa.

3426
02:36:50,160 --> 02:36:51,540
Yeah,
he doesn't look like,

3427
02:36:51,720 --> 02:36:53,310
you know,
he's going to enter in any bodybuilding

3428
02:36:53,311 --> 02:36:56,100
competitions,
but he looks like a guy who's got

3429
02:36:56,101 --> 02:36:57,180
vitality.
You know,

3430
02:36:57,181 --> 02:36:59,010
he's got,
he's got energy

3431
02:37:00,490 --> 02:37:05,490
like a creepy old dude.
He's got a lot of time down on with that

3432
02:37:06,271 --> 02:37:07,680
skin.
Oh Matt,

3433
02:37:07,681 --> 02:37:10,400
Sun damage did this guy never even heard
of sunscreen.

3434
02:37:10,410 --> 02:37:11,940
He's just run out there with no shirt
on.

3435
02:37:12,270 --> 02:37:14,580
He's out here with no shirt on.
Just running.

3436
02:37:15,470 --> 02:37:15,960
He's,
yeah,

3437
02:37:15,960 --> 02:37:16,040
it

3438
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:19,570
looks mountain nourished while he's
definitely not eating a lot.

3439
02:37:19,571 --> 02:37:20,211
Like,
I mean,

3440
02:37:20,211 --> 02:37:21,980
where's he getting his food?
I mean,

3441
02:37:21,981 --> 02:37:23,480
I don't know where he's getting money
from.

3442
02:37:23,630 --> 02:37:25,130
I don't,
I don't know how he does this.

3443
02:37:25,580 --> 02:37:27,920
Yeah.
I'm not really sure what he does for

3444
02:37:27,921 --> 02:37:29,510
funds or if,
you know,

3445
02:37:29,511 --> 02:37:33,320
it tries to live off the land and what's
going on unless he just park a bus in

3446
02:37:33,321 --> 02:37:36,140
there and just hang out.
Live to good question.

3447
02:37:37,130 --> 02:37:38,810
I mean there might be places where you
can,

3448
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:40,380
you have permanent parking.
Oh,

3449
02:37:40,620 --> 02:37:42,770
he's got a watch.
It's not a cheap watch.

3450
02:37:42,800 --> 02:37:43,910
Yeah,
he hasn't slide that,

3451
02:37:43,911 --> 02:37:44,810
watch it.
No.

3452
02:37:44,930 --> 02:37:45,763
No.
How much is that?

3453
02:37:45,850 --> 02:37:48,350
Watched those gps watch this like five,
600 bucks.

3454
02:37:48,410 --> 02:37:49,280
Oh really?
Yeah.

3455
02:37:49,880 --> 02:37:51,500
So it was like one of them Garmin's
yeah,

3456
02:37:51,690 --> 02:37:54,800
that's still look like.
So he creates these paths that he runs,

3457
02:37:55,130 --> 02:37:58,370
so he runs,
he'll break a path down,

3458
02:37:58,550 --> 02:38:02,210
like create a trail and then run it over
and over and over again.

3459
02:38:03,310 --> 02:38:03,770
Okay.

3460
02:38:03,770 --> 02:38:05,120
Which is kind of interesting,
right?

3461
02:38:05,121 --> 02:38:07,700
Cause he's like following his own
footprints.

3462
02:38:08,830 --> 02:38:12,350
He's got Oakley's on,
but he doesn't have a Sun Tan Sun

3463
02:38:12,350 --> 02:38:13,190
Lotion.
Right.

3464
02:38:13,191 --> 02:38:14,810
He doesn't give a fuck about skin
cancer.

3465
02:38:15,200 --> 02:38:17,840
He tells skin cancer to suck his dick.
Look at him.

3466
02:38:18,530 --> 02:38:21,140
He's like,
you can they make leather cancer in

3467
02:38:21,141 --> 02:38:22,940
Canada?
That's where all the had all those flags

3468
02:38:22,941 --> 02:38:24,500
or DDM?
British Columbia.

3469
02:38:24,640 --> 02:38:25,990
Yeah.
Someone,

3470
02:38:26,010 --> 02:38:29,240
the mountains of Vernon,
British Columbia lives a 76 year old man

3471
02:38:29,241 --> 02:38:32,810
by the name of Dag Abi.
How do you say that?

3472
02:38:33,500 --> 02:38:36,920
Abi Dag Abby,
his no cell phone or email address

3473
02:38:36,921 --> 02:38:40,160
revered by locals for having escaped
from the shackles of modern society.

3474
02:38:40,161 --> 02:38:42,440
He's the champion of the 80 mile ultra
marathon,

3475
02:38:42,470 --> 02:38:47,470
aptly named the death race.
Abby is the oldest person to have ever

3476
02:38:47,841 --> 02:38:48,890
finished the race.

3477
02:38:50,220 --> 02:38:50,620
Okay,

3478
02:38:50,620 --> 02:38:53,140
very fascinating man.
But these,

3479
02:38:53,141 --> 02:38:56,020
here's the thing,
the guy seems content.

3480
02:38:56,410 --> 02:39:00,370
How many 76 year olds do you run into
that are depressed,

3481
02:39:00,880 --> 02:39:04,240
that don't seem content,
that don't seem to have any vitality?

3482
02:39:04,390 --> 02:39:07,750
I mean,
we have to accept what life is going to

3483
02:39:07,751 --> 02:39:10,840
give all of us.
And it's a fucking an end where your

3484
02:39:10,841 --> 02:39:12,910
body's failing.
And you and I are starting to see that

3485
02:39:12,911 --> 02:39:15,010
now with our shit vision.
You know,

3486
02:39:15,090 --> 02:39:17,860
I see it now with um,
my,

3487
02:39:17,861 --> 02:39:22,270
uh,
my ability to recover from injuries like

3488
02:39:22,271 --> 02:39:24,310
special,
especially this tendonitis of have this

3489
02:39:24,311 --> 02:39:28,990
tendonitis in my elbow.
It's really shocking because I never had

3490
02:39:28,991 --> 02:39:31,660
like real tendonitis before.
I didn't know how long it takes.

3491
02:39:31,780 --> 02:39:34,180
I figured out it's like a pulled muscle.
Give it a couple of months,

3492
02:39:34,181 --> 02:39:35,560
we'll be all right.
No,

3493
02:39:35,710 --> 02:39:37,390
no.
A couple months later I still feel that

3494
02:39:37,391 --> 02:39:39,130
fucking thing.
I've done a lot of shit to it.

3495
02:39:39,130 --> 02:39:41,050
To stem cells.
PRP,

3496
02:39:41,051 --> 02:39:42,550
Regena keen.
It's getting better,

3497
02:39:42,880 --> 02:39:47,020
but shit is not quick to heal.
It takes forever and you gotta be real

3498
02:39:47,050 --> 02:39:50,140
delicate with it.
I have that with my hands.

3499
02:39:50,230 --> 02:39:52,600
Also.
If I get out of shape now I get out of

3500
02:39:52,601 --> 02:39:54,460
shape.
It takes way longer to get back into

3501
02:39:54,461 --> 02:39:56,590
shape.
Takes like double the time.

3502
02:39:57,280 --> 02:39:59,080
Like um,
when I did that,

3503
02:39:59,081 --> 02:40:01,780
a hot yoga challenge,
I hardly ever ran.

3504
02:40:01,810 --> 02:40:05,050
I didn't do any and I lost like a big
step.

3505
02:40:05,350 --> 02:40:10,350
It took me a solid two weeks to get back
to our was before doing yoga.

3506
02:40:13,340 --> 02:40:14,173
We're going,

3507
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:16,770
it's going down just like that old man
living in the forest,

3508
02:40:17,310 --> 02:40:19,800
but he's got it right.
He knows it's going down.

3509
02:40:19,830 --> 02:40:22,760
He's leaving behind nothing.
Jeremiah walking.

3510
02:40:22,761 --> 02:40:25,170
It's just lost all of the way that he
gained during that.

3511
02:40:25,171 --> 02:40:26,970
Wait,
it took them three months to lose it.

3512
02:40:27,330 --> 02:40:30,230
We should make Tony get fat.
We should force feed them.

3513
02:40:31,080 --> 02:40:33,690
We feed them that you just can't get
fat.

3514
02:40:33,691 --> 02:40:34,890
He's one of those guys.
I mean,

3515
02:40:34,920 --> 02:40:38,280
I think his whole life he's been had
that problem where he can eat as much as

3516
02:40:38,281 --> 02:40:39,690
you want.
He will never get fat.

3517
02:40:40,350 --> 02:40:42,960
That's not true.
And he will definitely get fat,

3518
02:40:43,230 --> 02:40:45,960
especially if each sugar.
But Tony eats pretty healthy.

3519
02:40:46,350 --> 02:40:48,780
He doesn't eat a lot of sugar.
It doesn't fuck around with anything

3520
02:40:48,781 --> 02:40:50,010
stupid.
And he'll,

3521
02:40:50,011 --> 02:40:52,650
he'll occasionally put like sugar in his
coffee or something like that,

3522
02:40:52,651 --> 02:40:54,090
but he's got a pretty good diet.

3523
02:40:54,570 --> 02:40:56,940
You know?
I just think that he's just,

3524
02:40:57,870 --> 02:40:58,760
you know,
it's,

3525
02:40:59,310 --> 02:41:01,440
that contest was bullshit.
Bullshit,

3526
02:41:01,640 --> 02:41:03,990
bullshit.
He wasn't really trying to gain weight.

3527
02:41:04,200 --> 02:41:06,750
He was like trying to let Jeremiah when
look at that,

3528
02:41:06,900 --> 02:41:09,780
how it was before and now after he lost
it all good for him.

3529
02:41:10,020 --> 02:41:12,930
It's not easy to lose weight.
Brian,

3530
02:41:12,931 --> 02:41:14,160
I'll tell you,
you deal,

3531
02:41:14,190 --> 02:41:16,980
you lost 70 at one point.
Well now it's,

3532
02:41:16,981 --> 02:41:18,660
you know,
I'm so happy with the relationship.

3533
02:41:18,710 --> 02:41:20,790
Me and my girlfriend cooks so nice.
It's,

3534
02:41:20,920 --> 02:41:22,620
it's,
it's more of me just going,

3535
02:41:22,860 --> 02:41:23,341
hey,
wait,

3536
02:41:23,341 --> 02:41:25,590
there's a new quarter pounder.
I know.

3537
02:41:25,950 --> 02:41:27,960
It's hard and a quarter pounder though.
Whoa.

3538
02:41:28,430 --> 02:41:29,430
Is it that good?
Yeah.

3539
02:41:29,431 --> 02:41:31,920
They're using good about it.
They're doing what Wendy's has always

3540
02:41:31,921 --> 02:41:33,210
done.
They're using real meat.

3541
02:41:33,260 --> 02:41:34,860
You know,
just go to Wendy frozen.

3542
02:41:35,010 --> 02:41:37,350
Yeah,
but it's heavy burger.

3543
02:41:37,380 --> 02:41:38,520
Like I was like,
Whoa,

3544
02:41:38,521 --> 02:41:40,710
this is not like a bitch ass
quarterpounder anymore.

3545
02:41:40,710 --> 02:41:42,510
This is,
it feels different.

3546
02:41:42,810 --> 02:41:45,480
It feels heavier.
That's like probably got more and more

3547
02:41:45,481 --> 02:41:46,314
moisture.
Yeah.

3548
02:41:46,770 --> 02:41:50,010
Well you know those places like in and
out and five guys,

3549
02:41:50,011 --> 02:41:53,550
they're always going to be a step ahead,
but you can't just pull in and grab one.

3550
02:41:54,060 --> 02:41:56,280
Think about Wendy's is,
you can pull in and grab one.

3551
02:41:56,281 --> 02:41:58,170
Like it's like boom,
boom,

3552
02:41:58,230 --> 02:42:01,080
boom.
It takes two minutes and all of a sudden

3553
02:42:01,081 --> 02:42:03,780
you've got a cheeseburger.
Shake shack.

3554
02:42:03,781 --> 02:42:05,170
If you've got to shake shack yet.
Yeah,

3555
02:42:05,190 --> 02:42:06,760
I've been to shake shack.
It's okay.

3556
02:42:07,650 --> 02:42:11,100
Shut the fuck up.
There's no way a compares to,

3557
02:42:11,410 --> 02:42:15,330
to black in and out.
Oh my goodness.

3558
02:42:15,380 --> 02:42:16,470
Oh yeah.
You think so.

3559
02:42:16,540 --> 02:42:19,620
Tainted has a water burger guy.
He thinks waterbirds it better.

3560
02:42:19,621 --> 02:42:23,400
But definitely shake shack is posted as
the Chili with the spaghetti.

3561
02:42:23,610 --> 02:42:28,610
No shaking steak and shake states.
Ohio does fucked up.

3562
02:42:30,480 --> 02:42:31,110
I fucked up.

3563
02:42:31,110 --> 02:42:32,970
Pardon me?
Shake shack and wasn't even thinking

3564
02:42:32,971 --> 02:42:35,080
about doing shake.
I'm thinking to steak and shake,

3565
02:42:35,490 --> 02:42:37,140
which also has cheeseburgers.
Right.

3566
02:42:37,800 --> 02:42:41,160
You were saying those little thin
patties that are like right.

3567
02:42:41,310 --> 02:42:42,570
I thought you were saying those words.
Good.

3568
02:42:42,600 --> 02:42:43,710
Okay.
My bad.

3569
02:42:44,340 --> 02:42:45,300
I fucked up.
I,

3570
02:42:45,540 --> 02:42:46,373
yeah,
shake shack.

3571
02:42:46,410 --> 02:42:47,840
I like way better than,
and I,

3572
02:42:47,900 --> 02:42:50,640
I'm not a fan of in and out.
I'm a five guys fan.

3573
02:42:51,030 --> 02:42:53,220
I love five guys.
If I'm going to go off the rails and

3574
02:42:53,221 --> 02:42:54,900
cheat,
I'm going to get a,

3575
02:42:55,090 --> 02:42:58,440
uh,
a double cheeseburger with Bacon and

3576
02:42:58,441 --> 02:43:00,190
Jalapenos.
Woo.

3577
02:43:00,200 --> 02:43:02,190
We sell it.
Call it to their burger is a double

3578
02:43:02,191 --> 02:43:05,160
burger by default.
By default.

3579
02:43:05,161 --> 02:43:07,730
If you want a single,
you've got to order it now to find out

3580
02:43:07,740 --> 02:43:08,820
the fries though.
I mean,

3581
02:43:08,821 --> 02:43:12,190
a lot of people love their fries,
know if they're fried boring

3582
02:43:12,190 --> 02:43:13,510
ass fries,
fool shit.

3583
02:43:13,511 --> 02:43:15,550
You got to get them spicy Cajun ones.
Yeah,

3584
02:43:15,551 --> 02:43:17,650
I got that.
You like to all of them and I'm like,

3585
02:43:17,651 --> 02:43:20,440
that's good.
It's just tech rally fries.

3586
02:43:20,441 --> 02:43:22,100
It's just I don't like too much
seasoning.

3587
02:43:22,930 --> 02:43:24,570
Those are actually supposed to be pretty
good.

3588
02:43:24,650 --> 02:43:27,040
That's not food.
That might as well be a stationary store

3589
02:43:27,041 --> 02:43:28,790
to me when I pass by I'm like,
Oh,

3590
02:43:28,791 --> 02:43:30,450
I'm not eating anything in there.
Yeah,

3591
02:43:30,550 --> 02:43:35,470
Mcdonald's fries all day though.
I'm not a McDonald's fries fan.

3592
02:43:35,471 --> 02:43:38,080
I'm an in and out guys fry's fan.
I'm habit burger.

3593
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:40,060
Mcdonald's fries.
I think that it's,

3594
02:43:40,061 --> 02:43:43,840
in my world it's five guys and in and
out or basically neck and neck.

3595
02:43:43,900 --> 02:43:46,720
I bet if I didn't live around so many in
and outs,

3596
02:43:46,990 --> 02:43:49,630
I would prefer in and out more than I
do,

3597
02:43:49,900 --> 02:43:53,410
but I'm only around like a couple of
five guys or five guys has some novelty,

3598
02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:56,260
but five guys also has Jalapenos.

3599
02:43:56,500 --> 02:43:59,890
There's a lot of good.
I like about five guys said either fries

3600
02:43:59,891 --> 02:44:02,500
I like better.
You don't like Wendy's as much as,

3601
02:44:03,220 --> 02:44:04,780
as much as in and out?
No.

3602
02:44:04,870 --> 02:44:06,100
No chance.
Not as good.

3603
02:44:06,130 --> 02:44:08,790
If I were to take 10 burgers here in
blindfold,

3604
02:44:09,550 --> 02:44:11,470
you know,
I would know.

3605
02:44:11,471 --> 02:44:14,560
What's the difference you'd be able to,
if you just got it from a regular store,

3606
02:44:14,800 --> 02:44:17,770
you remember?
I used to do a joke about actors being a

3607
02:44:17,771 --> 02:44:20,400
lot like cheeseburgers cause he never
looked like their pictures,

3608
02:44:22,690 --> 02:44:24,660
especially actresses.
Um,

3609
02:44:24,790 --> 02:44:29,790
but you never get a cheeseburger from
Wendy's that doesn't look like it's been

3610
02:44:29,981 --> 02:44:34,981
stuffed into one of those fucking foil
things and press down pickles on the

3611
02:44:35,111 --> 02:44:38,170
side so it makes it fresh every time.
Oh you're tricky.

3612
02:44:38,410 --> 02:44:40,060
Pickles on the side.
Tricky boy.

3613
02:44:40,690 --> 02:44:43,810
You sure they don't open that bitch up
and just take some pickles out there so

3614
02:44:43,811 --> 02:44:45,580
fast that Wendy's somehow that's a hack.

3615
02:44:46,030 --> 02:44:49,630
It's a hack the pickles on the side of
hack by writing their fats because

3616
02:44:49,631 --> 02:44:51,100
they're never frozen.
Jamie.

3617
02:44:51,400 --> 02:44:53,530
They're good.
I think they're good.

3618
02:44:53,590 --> 02:44:55,780
I mean I like Wendy's,
don't get me wrong,

3619
02:44:55,781 --> 02:44:58,370
but I just don't think they can ever
fuck with it.

3620
02:44:58,600 --> 02:45:01,390
Doesn't taste as good.
It's like five guys or they don't really

3621
02:45:01,391 --> 02:45:02,860
cook it right when you ask.
Yeah.

3622
02:45:03,190 --> 02:45:04,750
Like when you asked for it,
if five guys,

3623
02:45:04,751 --> 02:45:05,531
they go,
what do you want?

3624
02:45:05,531 --> 02:45:07,810
Okay.
And he see the guy take the patties,

3625
02:45:07,811 --> 02:45:09,070
put it on the grill and start cooking
it.

3626
02:45:09,100 --> 02:45:11,560
That's just a different experience.
Yeah.

3627
02:45:12,040 --> 02:45:14,650
Yeah.
I mean Burgers at Burger for the most

3628
02:45:14,651 --> 02:45:16,810
part,
but I just don't get the in and out shit

3629
02:45:16,811 --> 02:45:19,450
at all.
You know what the best is that nobody,

3630
02:45:19,570 --> 02:45:22,770
nobody respects anymore.
Fuddruckers oh,

3631
02:45:22,790 --> 02:45:25,300
we used to go to flood again.
Ostrich burgers.

3632
02:45:25,660 --> 02:45:28,270
Holy Shit.
I went last week,

3633
02:45:28,330 --> 02:45:28,810
man.

3634
02:45:28,810 --> 02:45:31,830
It's still good and they have to Nacho
cheese too.

3635
02:45:32,170 --> 02:45:35,410
They get scored that she's done.
Why does fuddruckers not get more love?

3636
02:45:35,500 --> 02:45:36,670
I think there's that many of them
around.

3637
02:45:36,671 --> 02:45:38,490
They need to expand.
Burberry.

3638
02:45:38,500 --> 02:45:41,740
Eddie Bravo and I used to go to 24 hour
fitness and I'm,

3639
02:45:42,160 --> 02:45:47,160
what the fuck is that one in?
Not duty on the way to encino in that

3640
02:45:49,931 --> 02:45:50,860
area.
What does that,

3641
02:45:51,050 --> 02:45:53,740
what was that called?
Sherman oaks and the Sherman Oaks

3642
02:45:53,740 --> 02:45:55,780
Galleria.
That's where it is 25 we'd go to eat

3643
02:45:55,781 --> 02:46:00,781
there we go lift weights and then we go
and eat at a fuddruckers and get ostrich

3644
02:46:00,911 --> 02:46:02,200
burgers.
Dude,

3645
02:46:02,710 --> 02:46:06,340
they're phenomenal.
It's an ostrich is you do not feel bad

3646
02:46:06,341 --> 02:46:07,690
for ostriches.
They,

3647
02:46:08,080 --> 02:46:10,100
I had an ostrich peck me in the fucking
head.

3648
02:46:10,100 --> 02:46:12,730
Once they're,
they're ruthless little cunt.

3649
02:46:12,760 --> 02:46:15,120
What's Oscar's tastes like?
I don't think I've ever had issues.

3650
02:46:15,170 --> 02:46:16,900
It's a red meat,
which is weird.

3651
02:46:16,970 --> 02:46:18,410
Huh?
Ostrich is a red meat.

3652
02:46:18,440 --> 02:46:21,080
Like it looks like buffalo or something.
It's a dark red meat.

3653
02:46:21,320 --> 02:46:24,560
It's really good.
It's supposed to be really high in

3654
02:46:24,561 --> 02:46:28,760
nutrients to and ostrich eggs as well.
Ostrich eggs like this fucking big too.

3655
02:46:28,761 --> 02:46:31,040
They're huge.
We made people eat him on fear factor.

3656
02:46:31,041 --> 02:46:33,680
They had to eat a whole egg.
They didn't drink a whole raw.

3657
02:46:34,160 --> 02:46:35,270
Probably terrible for you.
Right.

3658
02:46:36,530 --> 02:46:40,480
Let's wrap this up.
Uh,

3659
02:46:40,640 --> 02:46:44,330
next Tuesday I'll be on Brian's show.
That's at the Improv in Hollywood.

3660
02:46:44,360 --> 02:46:47,450
It's at eight o'clock,

3661
02:46:48,300 --> 02:46:50,930
Then I'll be at Sam triply show with a
store right afterwards.

3662
02:46:50,931 --> 02:46:53,300
I'm fucking crazy.
I'm total it up.

3663
02:46:54,590 --> 02:46:56,210
And uh,

3664
02:46:56,211 --> 02:46:57,560

Do you have a,

3665

road with kill Tony.

3667

Very excited to talk to Pat.
That should be fun.
