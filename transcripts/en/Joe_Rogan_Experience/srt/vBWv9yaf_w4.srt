1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,280
And we're live.
Dave Rubin trying to shut this fucker.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,950
Shut that fucking thing off for two 
seconds.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,990
We're here to celebrate the fact that 
Chris Christie got kicked off of a quiet

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
train this morning for talking on his 
phone while drinking a McDonald's 

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,831
strawberry shake.
And this is the guy who wants to band 

6
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:22,140
pot about band yourself.
You fucking Slob.

7
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:27,141
How dare you.
How dare he drink a McDonald's 

8
00:00:27,141 --> 00:00:28,860
strawberry shake in public and have 
everything.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,650
Not only that,
after having a stomach stapled.

10
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,490
Yeah,
it,

11
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,300
it didn't really take.
Yeah.

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,450
You know,
it's just those bitches out.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,600
You can do.
You have to do saying you think he's 

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:41,600
doing something.
I just keep eating.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,100
You just keep piling through.
I know a guy was blown through two of 

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:46,440
them.
He's had it done twice and blown through

17
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:51,441
a both times.
So you actually like tear open the 

18
00:00:51,441 --> 00:00:51,441
staples like is that I,
you know,

19
00:00:51,441 --> 00:00:54,240
I haven't done any Mris operations on 
these people.

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,850
We are going to go heavy medical stuff 
today,

21
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,970
but it's been explained to me,
Dave Rubin,

22
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:03,840
the skin is flexible and if you just 
keep stretching that bitch out,

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,080
it's clearly when these people,
like I have a friend and his friend,

24
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,220
his friend of mine as well,
but a good friend of his and he was 

25
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:15,450
about,
he's about to go do this and I said,

26
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,180
please try to talk them out of it 
because you don't need surgery.

27
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,870
He just needed to change your life 
because the surgery is only going to fix

28
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:26,871
the physical aspect of it.
There's a reason while you're stuffing 

29
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:27,570
all this sugar and fat and you're just.
You were addicted to food,

30
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,840
so you need to find out what it is,
what's going on.

31
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,880
So you're talking about the 
psychological.

32
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,660
I think that's where it's really at.
I don't think it is the physical thing.

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,900
I think the physical thing is a 
manifestation of a psychological issue 

34
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,230
for sure.
You get physically addicted to shitty 

35
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:45,810
food.
Like I quit sugar recently.

36
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,720
Shouldn't say quit sugar because I had a
little this weekend,

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,820
so I don't.
I didn't quit it,

38
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,030
but I,
I removed it from my primary diet and I 

39
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,080
quit it all together for two weeks and 
what happened to me five days in was 

40
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,150
really shocking because I had a massive 
headache like five days in.

41
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,330
The cravings were freaky and my head was
killing me and it's like snapples and 

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,840
protein bars and low fat milk.
There's all this shit that has sugar in 

43
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,030
it.
You think of granolas healthy and then I

44
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:21,360
would look at him like 20 grams of sugar
in a serving of grunt and I usually have

45
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:23,820
two servings.
You look,

46
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:25,470
it's not even sugar.
What we do,

47
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:30,471
we do in America,
we do high fructose corn syrup to 

48
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:33,060
illuminate you on this,
but in our coke and our can of coke,

49
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,540
because it's cheaper to put corn in it,
to sweeten it.

50
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,500
We're drinking corn instead of sugar.
That's why people get Mexican cokes.

51
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,990
You know what I mean?
You go to a fancy restaurant here in la,

52
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:45,750
they give you a Mexican coke because 
that has real sugar.

53
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,590
Think how just warped our whole system 
is the core thing.

54
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,530
We can do five hours on corn because 
corn is,

55
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,380
you know,
it's in,

56
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,760
it's in wallpaper,
it's an everything to mazing and you 

57
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,040
know,
you're trying to get off sugar,

58
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,100
but what you're really trying to get

59
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,590
off his corn,
there's definitely that as well.

60
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,230
Um,
but I,

61
00:03:04,231 --> 00:03:05,060
I think,
um,

62
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,500
even just simple sugar,
so like even like I read this one thing,

63
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:11,470
it's like a,
I forgot what the product was,

64
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:14,500
but it was one of the ingredients was 
pure cane sugar.

65
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,250
Like you're selling me something 
amazing.

66
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,670
Pepsi now,
pure cane sugar,

67
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:20,320
like holy shit,
sugar,

68
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:22,420
it's still sugar,
but it's still.

69
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:24,630
Your body doesn't necessarily 
differentiate.

70
00:03:24,631 --> 00:03:26,640
It still shows us salt,
you know,

71
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:27,130
like,
that's,

72
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,640
that's how dumb,
that's how dumb people have become about

73
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:35,641
food.
We were talking a little bit about food 

74
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:35,641
before we started,
but like it's really,

75
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:38,190
it's like the most important stuff,
what you put into your body so that then

76
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,950
you can function on this earth.
And we are so warped.

77
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,320
We got corn instead of sugar even just 
now.

78
00:03:45,321 --> 00:03:50,321
So I,
I told you I drank like 17 coffees 

79
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:50,321
before,
but I didn't put any.

80
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:51,880
You have Stevia and everything.
I just went straight,

81
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:52,870
black,
nothing.

82
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,610
I've been drinking straight black lately
too,

83
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,290
but it's actually,
you know,

84
00:03:56,291 --> 00:04:01,291
uh,
think this Guy Peter Giuliano on at one 

85
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,560
point who's a real coffee expert.
And uh,

86
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,800
when you talk to a guy like that and you
talk about putting cream into coffee,

87
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:10,000
you could see his face like,
what are you doing to him?

88
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,770
It's,
it's a sacrilege almost.

89
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,360
So what would,
what would you say to drink it?

90
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:14,980
What's the best way?
Just black.

91
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:16,840
That's it.
And I've been drinking a black.

92
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:22,110
I actually prefer it in a method that 
this Guy Rob Wolf created,

93
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,440
which is you mix it with grass fed 
butter and mct oil.

94
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,650
The problem is for a podcast that gives 
me phlegm and I stopped in the middle 

95
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:35,020
and it's annoying as fuck for people 
that are listening,

96
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:36,970
but it's pretty delicious.
It's very good.

97
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,170
Yeah.
I still do that,

98
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,240
but I just don't do it before podcasts 
anymore.

99
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:42,640
So I did it.
I did it for about six months.

100
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,760
I was doing the grass fed butter and 
coconut oil.

101
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,960
Just take a teaspoon of coconut oil and 
it's amazing and you feel great and it's

102
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:54,961
delicious and all that.
But I did over the course of about six 

103
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:54,961
months,
I probably gained like eight pounds from

104
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,370
all the butter.
It's,

105
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,870
it's a lot of calories to be plowing and
morning,

106
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,880
but he does do some good things.
I think it has something to do with how 

107
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:02,880
the caffeine actually ingests into your 
body.

108
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,760
It slows it down so you don't get that 
burst of energy crash and all that,

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,040
which was all great.
But you know,

110
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,660
eight pounds in six months.
That is a lot to gain.

111
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,920
Most people,
adults,

112
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,650
their appetite and your appetite.

113
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,030
Um,
no,

114
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:18,070
not really.
I don't give up.

115
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,540
I live in West Hollywood.
I,

116
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,600
there's a certain amount of working out 
I have to do and not,

117
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,170
not Joe Rogan level,
but you know,

118
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,300
uh,
it's uh,

119
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,580
just to stay in the neighborhood.
Just certain them out.

120
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,570
Have you ever been to Santa Monica in 
the middle of West Hollywood?

121
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:34,600
I live in the gay place on earth.
I've never seen so many daisy dukes.

122
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,490
It is.
It really bought well,

123
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:41,491
first of all,
I'm considered morbidly obese by these 

124
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:42,220
people's standards because they starve 
themselves.

125
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,240
I don't understand people listening.
Dave Rubin's a very slim and slender and

126
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:49,180
fit.
So the thing is,

127
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:50,240
these guys,
you know,

128
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,260
it's,
the gay is placed on earth and these 

129
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,971
guys work on their bodies all day long.
You should not be carrying

130
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,420
a dog.
They carry their dogs,

131
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:03,050
these relapses and all this other man.
Your bicep shouldn't be bigger than your

132
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:04,190
dog.
You know what I mean?

133
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:06,120
That just shouldn't be,
shouldn't be care.

134
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,030
I have a pimple.
She's not,

135
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,100
you know,
my bicep snapped bigger than her.

136
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,380
I think that's a healthy way to do it.
But yeah,

137
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,850
in West Hollywood,
these guys,

138
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,870
they start,
I don't know how to.

139
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:16,850
You Starve yourself and have huge 
muscles.

140
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,620
I just don't.
The steroids,

141
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,160
steroids,

142
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,990
that certainly helps.
You can.

143
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:26,010
There's some stuff that fighters had 
been caught with that.

144
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,480
Uh,
I think it's called.

145
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,260
There's one called clenbuterol and 
another called the nausea.

146
00:06:32,261 --> 00:06:32,850
No,
I think.

147
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:38,050
And the idea behind any of that stuff.
The cleanse I think is supposed to like 

148
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,050
really just lean you out.
It's a bodybuilder thing and this allows

149
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:45,051
you to keep mass on or helps you assist 
you in keeping mass on when you cut 

150
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:50,001
weight.
So for fighters that are trying to be 

151
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:50,001
like the biggest in their weight class 
right there,

152
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:54,741
dehydrating themselves,
but they want to keep as much muscle 

153
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:54,741
mass as possible.

154
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:55,290
Yeah.
That can't be good for long term health.

155
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,850
Right.
So bad for your body.

156
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,490
I mean I see it with these guys and it's
like,

157
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,320
you know,
they're doing this just so that they can

158
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:04,230
get somebody that has a better body than
them so they can fuck.

159
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,710
And then they move on to the next day.
It's like this endless game.

160
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:09,300
You know what I mean?
Like I got a hot body,

161
00:07:09,301 --> 00:07:10,950
he's got a high body.
I'll fuck him now.

162
00:07:10,951 --> 00:07:13,290
I moved to like,
it's just this climbing this ladder.

163
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,400
Yeah.
It's like Icarus,

164
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,020
you know what I mean?
You're just going up and up and up.

165
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:18,120
But one day this thing is just going to 
blow up in your face.

166
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,860
Yeah.
But you know,

167
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,520
that could be a second.

168
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,340
If you look at life like life is this 
temporary trip,

169
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:29,341
right?
You have maybe 50 years of people 

170
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,410
actually wanting to have sex.
You if you're fucking so lucky you take 

171
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,911
care of everything.
So that's like from 18 to like when 

172
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:40,050
you're closing in on 70,
everybody fucks.

173
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,410
You was just doing new charity

174
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,950
and that's the saddest.
That's the sadducees.

175
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,180
These you,
I see this,

176
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:50,181
these overly tanned hair plugged guys 
that are 70 years old and they're still 

177
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:55,701
at the gym hoping that that 28 year old 
is looking at them and instead they're 

178
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:57,450
staring at everyone and gawking at them 
horribly.

179
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,150
It's all grow.
It's really sad.

180
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:05,380
Or we can get into this a little later,
but it's also shows me why the gay 

181
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,630
marriage thing was so important because 
these are.

182
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,880
I actually have a lot empathy for these 
people that I can,

183
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,230
you know,
it's easy to make fun of,

184
00:08:10,231 --> 00:08:15,231
but like if you couldn't ever enter a 
relationship that then you're going to 

185
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:17,250
build like what you have with your wife 
where you can build a life,

186
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,300
you know,
and you can have kids and move forward 

187
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,501
in life.
Well then if all you have is just 

188
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:24,900
fucking,
you just keep doing it.

189
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,430
You not as many guys as possible 
rotations,

190
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,910
different ones texting you all day long 
trying to put it together.

191
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:32,670
Yeah,
I mean,

192
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,370
but figure out when you get squeezed the
time,

193
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,290
you know,
and it.

194
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,460
Exactly.
And I guess you know,

195
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:40,740
it feels good in the moment,
but for the longterm health of just like

196
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,440
what being human is

197
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,220
not so great,
but I think you know,

198
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,660
interestingly,
interestingly enough,

199
00:08:46,661 --> 00:08:49,750
if you look at the perspective of like a
full long life,

200
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:54,580
like it's just a bunch of moments just 
to like trying to maintain happiness and

201
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:59,581
a certain level as much as possible.
And you could be Chris Christie where 

202
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,160
you're addicted to Mcdonald's shakes and
being a fat slob.

203
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,760
The sausage sandwiches now can advise 
too much ego.

204
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:10,761
He doesn't listen or you could try to 
fill yourself up with that and you know,

205
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,720
be married and have kids and have that 
part of your life achieve normalcy.

206
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Or You can do the Super Tan roided up 
Dick Suck and rampage that,

207
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:25,980
those guys that workout at like Gold 
Gold's gym on Cole.

208
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,090
Do you know that?
That's by.

209
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:28,530
I don't know that one,
but dude,

210
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,390
when I was on news radio,
we used to work out,

211
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,750
uh,
we used to work at sunset and gower that

212
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:37,140
was the studio and Gold's gym was right 
down the street.

213
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,070
So sometimes we'd have off like two 
hours during the middle of the day where

214
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:42,810
they had to rewrite scripts or stuff 
like that.

215
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:45,030
So I'll just shoot over to goals,
get a workout and then come back.

216
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,610
But it is the fucking gays,
Jim.

217
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,620
It's not,
it's,

218
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:53,670
it's a ferocious disco is what it is.
It's just a bunch of men with scrunchy 

219
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:59,011
socks on timberlands and like super 
short shorts and just to tightest tank 

220
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:04,911
tops.
And you walk in there like a wounded 

221
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:06,120
antelope just gingerly stepping close to
the waterhole.

222
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,500
But how did you feel there?
Because you're,

223
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,840
you're in good shape but you're in good 
shape,

224
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,520
right?
Like you care about your body,

225
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:12,870
right?
You're doing the right things,

226
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,560
but you go in there and you see these 
guys and you,

227
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,100
you does it completely.
Like,

228
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,990
Oh fuck.
Like I'm a fat fuck.

229
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,610
No,
it wasn't that at all.

230
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,610
I was,
I was in my twenties when I was doing 

231
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:25,610
that.
This is one,

232
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:25,610
I was on news radio,
but I was.

233
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,200
I was fucking being targeted.
Like that was the problem.

234
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,870
Like guys felt like you could have 20 
pounds on the bar.

235
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,300
Guys like I'll spot you.
Like I don't need to spot dude.

236
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,880
Get your fucking balls from above my 
head.

237
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:41,080
Like they would literally,
you'd be on the bench and dudes would 

238
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,750
just put their dick above your head to 
grab the bar.

239
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:46,320
They just wanted their Dick in proximity
with your face.

240
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,770
You know like when you're doing bench 
presses,

241
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,900
they can literally bench press with 
their Cox.

242
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,810
This was pre Viagra to.
You got to think because this was in the

243
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:57,120
nineties,
these poor bastards were going on in the

244
00:10:57,121 --> 00:11:02,121
match and when it went bad then the coc 
pumps and w was the liberace movie with 

245
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,150
Michael Douglas behind the candelabra.

246
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,160
Yeah,
they have.

247
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,840
They used to have implants,
I guess back in those days.

248
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:14,841
Those poor guys.
I had no idea we were going to start 

249
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:14,841
like I didn't either.
That's the beauty of this show.

250
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,640
Let that bitch run for us a brief 
moment.

251
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:22,830
Not,
not entirely because I can defend 

252
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,951
myself,
but I felt what it was like to be a 

253
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:25,950
woman that was pursued by men because 
men are fucking gross.

254
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,090
Yeah,
well that's the thing.

255
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,420
It has nothing.
It has nothing to do with gay or 

256
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:32,420
straight.
It's a man thing.

257
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,700
So if you happen to be a man into men.
Yes.

258
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,730
Well congratulations.
You just got welcome to that world and 

259
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,450
were treated like a woman.
So I have great sympathy for women that 

260
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,250
have to deal with this shit.
I got treated like a woman with a gun,

261
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,230
like,
you know,

262
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:47,130
like Oh,
okay.

263
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,530
All right.

264
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,310
Relax.
Because I wasn't vulnerable physically 

265
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,550
because I was like stop.
Yeah.

266
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,040
And then it's two dudes looking at each 
other and I'm like,

267
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,090
you know,
come on man.

268
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,120
Get the fuck Outta here.
It wasn't like a woman who could 

269
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,810
physically be overpowered by this guy.
It was like a guy saying,

270
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,940
I'm going to kick your ass if you don't 
stop trying to fuck me.

271
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:12,270
Like stop.
Were you always amazed at their 

272
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,701
relentless,
relentless tenacity to never take a acu 

273
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:18,070
Joe Rogan into it and they can never 
take the cue,

274
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:18,700
right?
Yeah.

275
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:22,120
Well it's only a few guys.
Most guys would figure out that you were

276
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:25,000
straight and they were respectful.
The vast majority,

277
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,510
but it only takes if there's 300 guys 
working out at the gym,

278
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,260
it only takes two guys to fuck up the 
entire experience.

279
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:34,760
Less than one percent and they'll just 
do it.

280
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,210
But those are the ones that are just 
like,

281
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,750
they're going to go for it,
but how,

282
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,860
you know,
there's probably 50 other guys they're 

283
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:43,860
trying to work their way into the friend
zone,

284
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,210
which is what women experience would.
Women experiences a bunch of guys.

285
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:51,450
I can tell you,
especially when I was younger and I was 

286
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,671
single,
how many fucking girls that I dated who 

287
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:54,100
would work with some guy who would say,
well,

288
00:12:54,101 --> 00:12:57,690
Mike from the office says this is.
This is a much trying to fuck you.

289
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,980
Fuck you.
He's not even a real person.

290
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,250
He's not even a real person.
Mike's wearing a Kabuki mask and he's 

291
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:05,250
doing a fucking dance.
It's a mating dance.

292
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,390
That's not what he thinks.
This is bullshit.

293
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,160
Stop it.
Meanwhile,

294
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:10,730
I got to go to the gym and deal with 
that Mike,

295
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:16,070
because Mike is Jesus,
but that's what I mean.

296
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,800
It's there's a reason why there's 7 
billion of us because this,

297
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:24,610
this drive to procreate and not even on 
a conscious level.

298
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,050
It's not like,
oh my God,

299
00:13:26,051 --> 00:13:27,670
I have to get this girl pregnant and 
have a baby.

300
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:29,650
It's like I got to come inside her.
You know,

301
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,740
I have to come.
I have to figure out how to get this 

302
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:34,740
person touched my body and create 
pleasure.

303
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,440
You don't take.
You don't take the,

304
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,750
the,
the objective steps to recognize,

305
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:42,810
oh,
this is a gigantic biological trick 

306
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,331
that's been set in place by nature 
because it was really hard to survive 

307
00:13:45,331 --> 00:13:49,560
just a few thousand years ago.
It was insanely hard to survive and you 

308
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,071
had to make sure you meet as many people
as possible so that they made as many 

309
00:13:53,071 --> 00:13:53,740
people as possible.
So we can keep this retarded party going

310
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:58,741
on.
That's what it is that the end of the 

311
00:13:58,741 --> 00:13:58,741
day.

312
00:13:58,741 --> 00:13:59,190
That's what it is.
And that's why it keeps getting dumber.

313
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,570
I'm sure you've seen idiocracy you're 
not.

314
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,200
I honestly haven't seen it.
I've only seen clips of it,

315
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,950
but I had a bit that people accused me 
of stealing from idiocracy.

316
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,980
But luckily I did the bit before 
idiocracy came out.

317
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:14,230
So I got.
I got grandfathered in.

318
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,110
That's the comedians dilemma when you're
doing good shit.

319
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:19,150
So that 10 years later everyone's like,
oh,

320
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:20,200
you must have stole that.
And you're like,

321
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:20,470
no,
no,

322
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:22,420
no.
I did that 10 years ago.

323
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,160
Well,
it wasn't that close.

324
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:27,820
It was just the concept that many people
have had is a dumb people or outbreeding

325
00:14:27,821 --> 00:14:29,240
smart people.
Then that's the,

326
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,960
that's the movie mine was that explained
the pyramids.

327
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,760
My thing was that the idiot pyramid 
workers would show up one day and go,

328
00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:40,761
uh,
I was supposed to get my chuck on 

329
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:40,761
Friday.
Where is everybody?

330
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:44,250
But all the smart people figured out how
to build the pyramids had already died 

331
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,360
and that we had.
So the people just moved into the 

332
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:47,360
pyramids,
like why we live in these mud houses,

333
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,600
we can live in the periods.
So they moved into the pyramids and 

334
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,100
pretending they built it and it's this 
long thing that sort of explains

335
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,100
what's going on today.
And I think that we all think at a 

336
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:02,291
certain level that that's true,
that there's way more dumb people in 

337
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:05,531
there are smart people and then we all 
think that we benefit from people like 

338
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:08,540
Elan Musk and innovators and geniuses.
But how many of them are there?

339
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,970
Not many.
Not many.

340
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,660
Not many.
Tiny,

341
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,800
tiny number.
Yeah.

342
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:13,970
Well listen,
I,

343
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:16,010
uh,
I just got gay married like a month ago.

344
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,340
I love what you say,
gay marriage.

345
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:18,500
Well,
first off,

346
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,350
people don't believe that I'm gay.
They just simply don't accept.

347
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,870
Why don't they accept it?
They didn't say I don't act gay.

348
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:26,110
I play sports and I don't,
you know,

349
00:15:26,111 --> 00:15:27,650
like,
I got this at the gap,

350
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,790
you know what I mean?
Like I'm not getting,

351
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,850
like ever comprehend Fitch and get 
assaulted with that smell that they zap 

352
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:34,850
you with when you walk in there.

353
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,180
You know,
it's funny,

354
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:38,720
I know that smell a,
I used to be afraid when I was closeted,

355
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:42,020
like in high school and college because 
I didn't come out until really my mid to

356
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:47,021
late twenties,
but I used to be afraid of Abercrombie 

357
00:15:47,021 --> 00:15:47,021
and Fitch because they used to have 
those shirtless,

358
00:15:47,021 --> 00:15:51,850
you know,
like these shirtless hot guys standing 

359
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,580
outside and I felt that they could,
that they would know,

360
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,640
like I just thought like these guys are 
going to know that I'm standing outside 

361
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,440
the store.
Yeah.

362
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,590
Oh you don't remember that.
Like even the stores at the mall,

363
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,420
they'd have just these shirtless guys 
all,

364
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,850
you know,
they are all perfectly Tan.

365
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:07,610
They all look perfect and they would 
just be standing there greeting you.

366
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,200
And to me it was like this.
Yeah,

367
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,220
it was like walking into a porn.
So I was afraid that they were going to 

368
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:15,220
like read gay on me.
So I never,

369
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,171
I'm not kidding.
I don't think I've ever bought anything 

370
00:16:20,171 --> 00:16:20,810
from Abercrombie.
I've been there many times,

371
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,270
but I'd never seen never.

372
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,350
What year was it that they did this?
They were for a long time.

373
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:30,500
They were doing this probably in the mid
to early two thousands.

374
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,400
Yeah,
I know.

375
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:35,360
I probably didn't go to Abercrombie and 
Fitch until the mid two thousands.

376
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,550
Maybe they were phasing it out,
you know,

377
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:42,551
it's really interesting.
That started as a hunting and fishing 

378
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:42,551
supply company.
Yeah,

379
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:43,310
like void.
They fucking make a turn.

380
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,730
And then that guy,
you know,

381
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:47,930
the guy who runs it,
who's got,

382
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,560
he must have body dysmorphia.
So there's this guy up Jamie.

383
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:53,330
He's the one,
I don't know what his name is.

384
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:54,880
He's the one who,
uh,

385
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,980
he really instilled this idea that 
everyone there has to look perfect and 

386
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,671
look the same sort of.
And that's why they've had all these 

387
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:03,671
lawsuits with people that are either a 
little fat.

388
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:08,621
They couldn't get jobs there or I think 
there was a girl who wanted to wear a 

389
00:17:08,621 --> 00:17:08,621
hijab or all that stuff.

390
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,780
And,
but if you look at this guy will pull 

391
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,851
them up,
got so much fucking work done on his 

392
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:15,851
face because he's just close to what you
said before.

393
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:20,561
He's like expressing his own weaknesses 
and he's projecting them onto a 

394
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:25,331
generation of kids and he's also 
expressing his own confusion externally.

395
00:17:26,031 --> 00:17:26,950
Whether you realize,
I mean,

396
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,630
look at that guy like he's had some 
serious shit.

397
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:34,631
Sixty one year old CEO.
We don't need to say his name says dude 

398
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:34,631
a lot.
He'll say,

399
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:35,540
oh,
this is salon.com.

400
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,860
First of all,
fuck,

401
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,600
fuck,
fuck you.

402
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,620
I'm down with that fucking creeps.
Frauds just aggressively shitty and I 

403
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,440
don't fight those fucking headlines.
Those tweets I had done following 

404
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,620
because I was like,
this is such epic Shit and just such 

405
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,751
dishonest trash like a Dave Rubin.
Why he's everything that's wrong with 

406
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:58,140
gay people.
Taglia.

407
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:03,340
Exactly.
You would get those kinds of articles 

408
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,301
and just twisting and distorting your 
real positions to make social brownie 

409
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:07,770
points to appeal to the hardest of 
hardcore,

410
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:10,530
aggressive social justice warrior 
lefties.

411
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:15,590
Can we get everybody to hate everybody?
Fucking split everybody down to just 

412
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:22,371
their color and their sex to the point 
where you can then control everybody 

413
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:23,490
because if anyone gets out of that 
little box,

414
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,820
there is something wrong with them.
Got Something wrong with you.

415
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,000
Well,
this poor guy,

416
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,440
he's not hanging in there.
Well,

417
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,960
like Robert Redford,
that motherfucker's going in there.

418
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:31,410
Well,
yeah,

419
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,460
he's hanging in there.
Well,

420
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:35,490
he's obviously an old dude,
but it doesn't look like a monster.

421
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,510
Yeah.
Like I was at,

422
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:41,511
um,
my kid has a gymnastics class and 

423
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:44,631
there's this poor,
unfortunate woman who goes to this 

424
00:18:44,631 --> 00:18:44,631
gymnastic class who,
uh,

425
00:18:44,631 --> 00:18:47,550
she looks like she's quite wealthy.
She's always dressed very well,

426
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,820
but she's gotten what I call monster 
face and monster faces when they shoot 

427
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,451
their face up with filler and then they 
do the lips and then they pull their 

428
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:56,451
face back.

429
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:57,540
So they have this sort of reptilian 
mouth.

430
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,690
Mouth is way too big.
It's way too big.

431
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:06,160
Pull on this fucking skin.
So the opening of their mouth doesn't 

432
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,670
match a normal person's face because 
it's bigger.

433
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,140
It stretches like this guys,
Chris Christie stomach pulling it,

434
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:15,180
it gets bigger.
Being skin is flexible.

435
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,030
Think how deranged.
Really like the idea of that.

436
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,120
You know,
these people care about what they look 

437
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,120
like,
right?

438
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,120
So they want to look better.
So they go in that first time,

439
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,790
they get a little botox or they get 
wrestling or one of those filters,

440
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:31,140
whatever that is.
But think how the course of that changes

441
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:36,141
the way they think about everything to 
the point where that woman probably 

442
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:36,890
thinks she looks good.
You know what I mean?

443
00:19:36,891 --> 00:19:38,880
That's,
that's an adventure in the psyche,

444
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:40,170
right?
I mean,

445
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:43,470
it's the same as bodybuilders.
It's the same as people with Anorexia.

446
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,570
It's the same as the guys we were 
talking about before.

447
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,440
You know what I mean?
They just,

448
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,410
you just keep doing it.
No matter what you do,

449
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:51,270
you take off your shirt,
you look in the mirror and you go,

450
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,130
this should be a little tighter over 
here,

451
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,640
you know?
And the woman's looking at her,

452
00:19:54,641 --> 00:19:57,390
it's always the upper lip.
That's the women.

453
00:19:57,391 --> 00:20:02,391
They get fat for this poor lady that I 
know that had her lips done and every 

454
00:20:02,731 --> 00:20:07,731
time she talks to you that she's got a 
scar like inside of her mouth that's 

455
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,570
like,
it's her lip,

456
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,100
you know,
it's like it.

457
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,300
There's a line.
So like the lips never moved correctly.

458
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,520
Like Lisa Rena,
is that her name?

459
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,060
She had that thing removed right as she,
she,

460
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,740
she was the one that had like the crazy,
crazy,

461
00:20:22,741 --> 00:20:25,560
crazy lips and I'm pretty sure about a 
year ago,

462
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,860
uh,
she had something taken out or some 

463
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,620
filler or something.
But I get it though,

464
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:36,621
man.
I had hair transplants when I was in my 

465
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:36,621
twenties and didn't take trig.
Definitely didn't take.

466
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:38,580
Not Anymore.
I had a joke about it.

467
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:43,581
The joke was it's like taking really 
healthy people and moving them into a 

468
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:47,070
neighborhood where everybody's dying.
It's like we try to repopulate.

469
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:47,920
Chernobyl,

470
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,130
you thought you were gentrifying the 
front,

471
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:52,840
but in the end you just killed more 
people?

472
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:53,650
Well,
you know what it is,

473
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:55,120
man.
You keep losing hair.

474
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,890
So worked at first like,
oh yeah,

475
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:58,790
the parts that it was falling out.
I filled in.

476
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,280
We're good,
but you're not good.

477
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,300
You key,
it keeps,

478
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:06,570
keeps [inaudible] up.
So you did the thing where you actually 

479
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:06,970
cut out.
Oh yeah.

480
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:09,310
Wow.
They cut a strip out.

481
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:12,730
How long did you let it go before you 
gave up and just said,

482
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,820
well I had it done and then it's slow.
It was just slowly giving up and then 

483
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,750
there's also things you can do,
like you could take Rogaine,

484
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:24,751
which kind of keeps it in,
but how funny is it when your name is 

485
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:26,090
Rogan and you go into buy Rogaine?
That's,

486
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,940
that's ironic.
Just for that reason.

487
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,000
Well you probably shouldn't have been on
it because it was just dealt with it,

488
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,540
dealt with that,
but I'm like if it works I don't give a 

489
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:36,540
shit.

490
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:36,540
And it did kind of work.
And then Propecia,

491
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,220
which works really well but also kills 
your tick.

492
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,880
Yeah.
So you got,

493
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,710
you got a lot of.
Lot of options.

494
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,930
I did.
I was on probation for about six months,

495
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:47,950
about maybe seven or eight years ago and
I couldn't get a boner.

496
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,920
Yeah,
it's a boner killer rather than like,

497
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,390
I can fully say that,
but now that I shaved my head,

498
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:59,200
I actually like it way better.
It's so easy and you don't get kidnapped

499
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:01,760
by people that are cutting your hair 
because uh,

500
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:06,780
I used to cut,
get my hair cut by this lady who I love 

501
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:06,780
dearly,
but sometimes I'd be in a rush.

502
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,670
She would hold me hostage with these 
fucking stories because she'd be holding

503
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:14,671
the scissors and then I told her,
you're not going to fucking talk to me 

504
00:22:14,671 --> 00:22:14,671
like that.
And I'd be like,

505
00:22:14,671 --> 00:22:15,520
oh,
it really interesting.

506
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,310
Cut My fucking hair so I can run,
cut my hair so I can run away.

507
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,400
So basically you shaved your head 
because you didn't want to listen to 

508
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:23,400
this bitch?
No,

509
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:23,400
she's not.
She's not big.

510
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:23,800
She's my friend.
I love her.

511
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,620
But your stories are terrible,
but it's not even that.

512
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,620
It's just,
it's something to not think about.

513
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,630
It's like all of a sudden when I shaved 
it,

514
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:32,830
it was like instant freedom.
Like,

515
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:37,890
Oh yeah.
And I use the back of my head as a 

516
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:37,890
public service announcement.
Like if anybody's thinking about getting

517
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,280
a hair transplant,
I'm like,

518
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,910
look at my head,
let's see the scar.

519
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,970
You don't want one of those,
then it's not the worst thing in the 

520
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:44,970
world.
Let me get this straight.

521
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,691
Can you swim?
Because I always see in the commercials 

522
00:22:48,691 --> 00:22:48,691
when they get the hair,
suddenly they can swim again.

523
00:22:48,691 --> 00:22:53,460
It seems like they couldn't swim.
They had lost the ability to do the 

524
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,250
breast stroke.
The wig commercials are the same.

525
00:22:54,251 --> 00:22:59,251
And the commercials,
they're always underwater just like 

526
00:22:59,251 --> 00:22:59,251
fucking crazy.
So you're telling me you can still swim.

527
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:03,310
It's not as good.
I'm a little sleeker through the water,

528
00:23:03,311 --> 00:23:05,380
so it's confusing,
but timing is off.

529
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,970
It all.
It makes no sense because the,

530
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,370
you see the Olympic guys,
they were the cap.

531
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:13,250
So then it makes it seem like they're 
bald and they're swimming well and yeah,

532
00:23:13,251 --> 00:23:18,251
you watch those commercials and then 
they have a head of hair and they're 

533
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:18,251
swimming well.
So it's a very confusing.

534
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:20,020
I think the idea is that if you get in 
the water,

535
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:24,460
like instantly all the work that you've 
done with hairspray to lock this fucking

536
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:29,730
monster and place it all evolve,
dissolves with the water and you'll 

537
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,120
leave behind an oil slick.
But,

538
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:31,990
uh,
when you,

539
00:23:31,991 --> 00:23:36,991
uh,
when you get in the water with one of 

540
00:23:36,991 --> 00:23:36,991
those wacky wigs hair club,
jammies,

541
00:23:36,991 --> 00:23:39,370
when the idea is that you can,
nobody can tell,

542
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,860
nobody can tell.
Now I know you have theories on things.

543
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:45,290
Do you have a theory on hair loss?
Was it stress related for you?

544
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,070
It's just

545
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,550
purely a hundred percent.
Genetics is dihydrotestosterone.

546
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:51,770
Your body produces a derivative of 
testosterone.

547
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:55,550
DHT causes your hair to fall.
I don't know why it exists in humans.

548
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,060
It's a strange thing and why it exists 
in some and not others,

549
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,050
but they're,
they're like really close to fixing that

550
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,170
apparently with just like some sort of a
pill or a rub,

551
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:09,650
but that'll probably cause cancer or 
blind in one eye.

552
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:14,690
You have diarrhea and all that shit.
Every pill we take causes 20 other 

553
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,080
things,
you know,

554
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,180
you know,
I really think that they need to start.

555
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,420
They need to show us when they talk 
about the pill,

556
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:22,300
whatever pill it is,
you got restless leg syndrome,

557
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:27,310
you got what is that?
Your legs can't stop because that real 

558
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,150
build art is a funny bit.
I that like,

559
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,680
you know,
because we sit all day.

560
00:24:30,681 --> 00:24:32,720
It's your body like revolting against 
you,

561
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,860
like get the fuck up.

562
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,070
I wonder if like joggers get restless 
leg syndrome,

563
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,300
not because they're actually moving.
Yeah,

564
00:24:39,301 --> 00:24:41,610
I mean that would be really interesting 
to study with.

565
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,530
Jamie,
you're a runner.

566
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,690
Do you ever get restless legs?
You do.

567
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,400
You got the late.
My whole life.

568
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,880
You get restless leg but you've run a 
lot.

569
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,410
While I was moving my legs over here 
feel like they need to move.

570
00:24:52,411 --> 00:24:54,170
I don't know.
Wow.

571
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,470
Oh,
I'm not sure.

572
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,880
I don't.
You think they should have to show like 

573
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,280
when they show you the pill and they and
then everyone's running in a field.

574
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:02,840
It's all that bullshit marketing 
nonsense,

575
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,200
but then they'll say I could cause 
suicidal thought they should've show 

576
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,490
someone going through suicidal thoughts 
or show somebody having diarrhea.

577
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,700
Like they keep doing this,
but the guys running through a field 

578
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,011
having a helped show me what it's like 
dos commercial death show a guy walking 

579
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:19,550
down the boardwalk just dropping dead.

580
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,950
You know what I mean?
Like why are they allowed to do that?

581
00:25:21,951 --> 00:25:24,950
It's such mixed messaging.
You don't understand what you're getting

582
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:27,110
yourself into chantix.
You're going to stop smoking.

583
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,610
You might drop dead,
you might,

584
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,020
you know,
explosive diarrhea,

585
00:25:30,021 --> 00:25:31,760
whatever it is.
Like show me.

586
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,830
Yeah.
That's one thing if you're advertising a

587
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:34,610
car,
right?

588
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:39,870
You know,
you've got like the newest Cadillac and 

589
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:39,870
it looks cool and you drive and you look
cool.

590
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:40,220
Driving like,
man,

591
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:43,130
I want to get one of those.
That's sort of okay,

592
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:46,200
but if it's another thing,
if it's some crazy you meant,

593
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:48,520
you remember there was a drug that they 
were selling for a while.

594
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:53,570
They were advertising that was a 
supplement to your current 

595
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:53,570
antidepressants.
Oh,

596
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,230
that was like an bill,
a fly or something like that.

597
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,120
Was that the one with the cloud?
The cartoon cloud that was following the

598
00:25:59,121 --> 00:25:59,390
guy?

599
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,940
I think it was because if you have a 
cartoon in cloud,

600
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:07,330
you've got some serious problems,
but there's something fucked up about 

601
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:11,260
advertising for something that's a drug 
that can affect your mind and possibly 

602
00:26:11,691 --> 00:26:16,691
cause suicidal thoughts because 
advertising is entirely designed to coax

603
00:26:17,061 --> 00:26:18,770
you into buying the product.
Sure.

604
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,800
And that's a big life to say.
Ask Your doctor about it and that you 

605
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,611
shouldn't be allowed to say that.
You shouldn't be allowed to say it 

606
00:26:27,611 --> 00:26:27,800
because then every first off,
everybody's on prescription drugs.

607
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,050
I'm not on any prescription drugs right 
now.

608
00:26:30,051 --> 00:26:35,051
I have been for about six months also 
around the time I was on Lexapro or one 

609
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:39,100
of those mild kills your Dick to.
You got a double whammy.

610
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,910
It was getting kicked.
Punched.

611
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,110
Well,
he's back.

612
00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:43,470
He's back.
And better than ever.

613
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,400
Yeah,

614
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,850
success.
But I was on one of those and when I,

615
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:52,910
when I got off,
I know you're supposed to tell your 

616
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,240
psychiatrist or whatever because they'll
ween you off it.

617
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:56,130
But I was like,
I didn't like the guy and I was like,

618
00:26:56,131 --> 00:27:01,131
I'm just going to get off this thing.
He didn't like the psychiatrists are 

619
00:27:01,131 --> 00:27:01,131
keeping shit from them.
I didn't like.

620
00:27:01,131 --> 00:27:05,500
His last name was Ruben,
which is why I went to him and then I 

621
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:05,500
just didn't like them and I was like,
fuck this.

622
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:05,700
I'm not going to do it.
But anyway,

623
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,110
uh,
I just figured,

624
00:27:07,111 --> 00:27:07,650
all right,
I take,

625
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:12,651
instead of taking one a day,
I'll just do one every other day and 

626
00:27:12,651 --> 00:27:12,651
then one every three days,
something like that.

627
00:27:12,651 --> 00:27:14,490
And it worked.
I weaned off if I kid you not,

628
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:20,390
I swear to God this is true.
I remember when you used to turn on an 

629
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:20,390
old computer,
like an old desktop computer,

630
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:25,190
all the worrying and the buzzing and 
you'd hear the hard drive spinning and 

631
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,190
all that shit.

632
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:28,260
I could feel that in my brain for about 
two weeks when I got off it.

633
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:33,300
Whoa.
I felt my brain actually resetting or 

634
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:33,780
something like literally a worrying 
there was like.

635
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,640
And then like little sparks.
Was this when you were thinking or 

636
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,230
anytime?
I just remember I lived in New York City

637
00:27:40,231 --> 00:27:45,231
at the time.
I remember very vividly one day I was 

638
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:46,911
walking down in Amsterdam and I was 
maybe a week out and I felt my brain 

639
00:27:46,911 --> 00:27:48,540
like just coming back on.
So that shit,

640
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,290
it does something to you.
It does something and forget.

641
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,420
And the boner stuff,
and you know,

642
00:27:54,421 --> 00:27:59,421
all that I had of the reason I got off 
it actually was because one of my best 

643
00:27:59,421 --> 00:28:02,871
friends,
childhood best friends was killed in a 

644
00:28:02,871 --> 00:28:02,871
car accident.
And uh,

645
00:28:02,871 --> 00:28:07,820
when I heard I had almost no reaction is
one of my best friends from four years 

646
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:10,920
old and I just was like,
I was sad,

647
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,220
but like I didn't have a sad reaction,
you know,

648
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,250
like I knew it was sad,
but my reaction was and said,

649
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,330
and then I was like,
all right,

650
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,260
that's it.

651
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:24,410
That's tough.
It's a terrifying thing to remove the 

652
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:24,410
lows.
Yeah.

653
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,820
All the lows.
The lows are there to teach you.

654
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,050
Yeah.
I mean,

655
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:30,450
you gotta learn,
you gotta learn from failure.

656
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,860
Failure is important.
It's an and,

657
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,800
and,
and feeling bad is important.

658
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:37,020
It's,
it really is because it makes,

659
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:42,050
it,
makes you understand and appreciate the 

660
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:42,050
magnitude of feeling good.
I like it.

661
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,150
It draws you towards that as a better 
alternative.

662
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:44,490
Sure.

663
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:49,650
And especially as an artist that someone
that speaks and is supposed to have a 

664
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,770
full set of emotions,
I'd be able to go on stage,

665
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,270
tell people what I think,

666
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:58,390
you know,
that's the argument with school 

667
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,741
shooters.
One of the things about school shooters 

668
00:28:59,741 --> 00:29:00,050
is a massively disproportionate amount 
of them are on.

669
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,730
And the idea is that they can do that 
and you know,

670
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,340
the what is,
for what,

671
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,520
you know,
what came first,

672
00:29:07,521 --> 00:29:12,521
is it the disease,
the mental illness that causes them to 

673
00:29:12,521 --> 00:29:12,680
be able to shoot somebody in the first 
place?

674
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:18,040
Or is it the fact that they're on pills?
Is it the fact that they're on pills 

675
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,280
because they're mentally ill?
Who the fuck knows?

676
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:24,550
But people that I know that have been on
various antidepressants,

677
00:29:24,801 --> 00:29:29,801
Ssri is whatever they,
they tell you that things don't bother 

678
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:29,801
them.
The.

679
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:30,950
So if things don't bond,
like shooting people,

680
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:36,100
like the lack of empathy.
Like it seems to me in my armchair 

681
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,100
psychology,
you know,

682
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,410
position that that would just be a 
correlation there.

683
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:39,860
Well

684
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,190
it's always why we have a real

685
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,920
inability in America to talk about two 
things at once.

686
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:46,930
That two things can be true at the same 
time.

687
00:29:46,931 --> 00:29:49,780
So like when you look at the shootings 
immediately,

688
00:29:49,781 --> 00:29:54,781
the people who are against guns will say
it's about guns and the people who are 

689
00:29:54,781 --> 00:29:56,380
for guns will say it's about mental 
health.

690
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,650
Pretty sure two things can be true at 
the same time.

691
00:29:59,651 --> 00:30:04,651
Absolutely.
We have a mental health problem and we 

692
00:30:04,651 --> 00:30:05,560
have to easy access to guns.
I'm a hunter.

693
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,690
I'm pretty sure your second amendment 
right.

694
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:08,440
Yes.
Yeah.

695
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,500
I'm,
I believe in the second amendment we 

696
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,110
should be able to arm ourselves,
but it is still too easy to get guns.

697
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:19,111
You shouldn't be able to necessarily 
have a assault rifle to plow down 30 

698
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:19,450
people.
It was all that.

699
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,310
Um,
but at the same time,

700
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:24,820
yeah,
a huge percentage of these people are on

701
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,080
some sort of medication.

702
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,470
That's not a coincidence.
Not all men,

703
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,740
if they didn't have something wrong with
them,

704
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,260
no matter how many guns you had access 
to your,

705
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:32,770
your,
uh,

706
00:30:32,771 --> 00:30:33,190
your,
uh,

707
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,800
relatively same guy,
no matter how many guns you have,

708
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,920
you're not going to shoot a school,
right?

709
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:38,950
Yeah.
So that says,

710
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:44,070
yeah,
there's some mental health component to 

711
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,070
this.
Well,

712
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,080
I think it should be really difficult to
get a car to.

713
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,180
I mean I think it should be get 
difficult to get a gun.

714
00:30:46,181 --> 00:30:51,181
I mean in,
in so as they should do some sort of 

715
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:51,181
background check.
They should.

716
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:53,710
They should evaluate whether or not you 
have any competency whatsoever.

717
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,570
Have you.
How much have you learned about shooting

718
00:30:55,571 --> 00:30:57,460
a gun?
And that's not the case right now.

719
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,370
I mean the other problem is there's so 
many guns out there that the people that

720
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:02,980
are doing this shit,
like this last guy in Oregon,

721
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,630
I think he didn't get the gun.

722
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,800
It was his mom that got the same 
results.

723
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:11,850
I can get a gun even if even if you 
shouldn't be able to get a gun that is 

724
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,020
an issue,
but we should make it more difficult.

725
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,140
And the mental health aspect of it as a 
huge problem.

726
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,590
And to say that it's not that it's only 
a gun issue is,

727
00:31:20,591 --> 00:31:23,070
is a blind thing that people do.
Yeah,

728
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,990
I think you're right.
I think there's,

729
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:30,050
there's a bunch of different issues at 
stake here and I think that's the case 

730
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,181
with a lot of different things and 
that's one of the problems that I have 

731
00:31:33,181 --> 00:31:33,181
with like the idea of a left and a 
right.

732
00:31:33,181 --> 00:31:36,430
I think I have a lot of left ideas,
almost all of them,

733
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:41,490
you know,
and then I'll have a few right ideas I 

734
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,561
have.
I'm on sort of both sides of a lot of 

735
00:31:43,561 --> 00:31:43,561
shit.

736
00:31:43,561 --> 00:31:46,260
Yeah.
Well I definitely want to get into that 

737
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:46,260
with you because that's become like my,
my home now.

738
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,840
This is really the split on the left 
between what I'm calling the regressives

739
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,700
and people that I think really stand for
liberal principles.

740
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,460
That's all on the left.
But yeah,

741
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:55,580
I have some good.
I have a lot.

742
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,900
Look,
comedians in general I think have hugely

743
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:02,170
strong libertarian leanings because you 
want to be.

744
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:07,171
I'm a firm believer that the government 
should have very little to do with our 

745
00:32:07,171 --> 00:32:08,020
lives,
make sure I don't get shot,

746
00:32:08,021 --> 00:32:09,850
which they're not that great at that,
uh,

747
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,620
you know,
take care of the economy,

748
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,680
keep us safe.
Like that pretty much is what I think 

749
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:16,680
the government's role should be.
That's it.

750
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:16,690
That's about it,
you know,

751
00:32:16,691 --> 00:32:18,190
make sure we have a good education 
system.

752
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:20,620
The road should be okay.
You're like pretty limited stuff.

753
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:24,880
And I think usually for some reason 
comedians do fall on that scale.

754
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,380
You know,
Chris Rock is there a bill Maher,

755
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:28,180
this,
a zillion comedians on that side of it.

756
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,400
Um,
but I've seen a massive split in the 

757
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,881
left right now and this goes to all the 
social justice warrior shit and 

758
00:32:35,881 --> 00:32:38,350
everyone's a racist and a homophobe and 
it's fucking exhausting.

759
00:32:38,351 --> 00:32:39,650
And it's a,

760
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:45,130
well look,
you've had Sam Harris on a bunch of 

761
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,931
times.
Look what these people have done to Sam 

762
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:46,931
Harris.
It's insane.

763
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:50,030
They're just using him as a target or 
that's what I believe.

764
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:55,090
I believe that instead of looking at his
actual positions and being objective and

765
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,830
saying,
does he have a point?

766
00:32:57,831 --> 00:32:59,900
What is his point?
Let's debate the point.

767
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,640
Let's,
let's debate the merits of the point.

768
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,450
Instead.
He's a guy that you can point to and say

769
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:08,390
he will.
He has a strong position about Islam,

770
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:13,510
so he is Islamophobic.
He is there for racist and he should be 

771
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:17,321
attacked and fuck that piece of shit.
And I mean I've seen the same written 

772
00:33:17,321 --> 00:33:17,710
about Christopher hitchens.
You know,

773
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,680
I saw some people when he died that were
running good written,

774
00:33:20,681 --> 00:33:25,681
so I made fun of this one social justice
war because he was saying good riddance 

775
00:33:25,681 --> 00:33:26,780
to Hitchens,
but then when Osama bin Ladin died,

776
00:33:26,781 --> 00:33:31,781
he was like,
I'm not going to celebrate the death of 

777
00:33:31,781 --> 00:33:31,781
any human being like,
well,

778
00:33:31,781 --> 00:33:31,781
this is fucking hilarious.

779
00:33:31,781 --> 00:33:31,781
This is.
Yeah,

780
00:33:31,781 --> 00:33:33,050
I know what you're doing.
You're not thinking.

781
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,120
You're not thinking you're,
you're writing things.

782
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:40,121
And this is part of the problem with 
social media and I think one of the 

783
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:43,451
things that we're finding with this 
whole social social justice warrior 

784
00:33:43,451 --> 00:33:47,540
issue is that it's not necessarily just 
opinions.

785
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,800
It's opinions that are being expressed 
in a way where they know people are 

786
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,531
going to hear it.
They know people are going to see their 

787
00:33:56,531 --> 00:33:58,391
writing and so that that knowledge that 
someone's going to see what you're 

788
00:33:58,391 --> 00:34:01,610
writing and react to it either positive 
or negative effects your choices.

789
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:06,910
It's like reality TV and what they're 
doing is like when you see people act 

790
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:10,730
fake on reality TV because you know that
they know the cameras are on them.

791
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,730
That's what you're doing when you make a
retarded social justice warrior tweet,

792
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,290
you're a hundred percent right.

793
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,910
So I know someone,
I can't get their name,

794
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:21,940
who right now is pretty big in their 
reality space on a reality show right 

795
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,090
this second.
No,

796
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:27,120
the very well.
And he says to me all the time like 

797
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,010
that's what he's doing.
All he's doing is ramping up to stay on 

798
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,280
the show to keep the whole thing though,
of course.

799
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,380
And that's what these people are doing.
So Sam,

800
00:34:33,381 --> 00:34:35,180
how many times has he been here at least
twice,

801
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:35,970
right?
Horror,

802
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,490
four or five.
Four or five times.

803
00:34:37,491 --> 00:34:41,510
So you've sat with this guy for hours 
and hours with this guy.

804
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,660
Do you think he's racist in any way 
whatsoever,

805
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:45,800
but he's.
You know what he is,

806
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,150
he's fearless.
Yes.

807
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:52,310
And,
and I'm not saying he doesn't have fear 

808
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:52,310
of normal consequences of,
you know,

809
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,540
whatever danger.
It's not that,

810
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:56,750
it's just that if he has a principal who
express it and I've,

811
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,610
I've disagreed with them about certain 
points,

812
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,480
of course,
his,

813
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:04,540
his principles and his opinions are,
he will truly express,

814
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,660
express them.

815
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:11,020
And in unpopular subjects,
like when you're talking about Islam or 

816
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,740
you're talking about religion in 
general,

817
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:17,860
I mean,
he takes a tremendous amount of heat 

818
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:17,860
about that and he only gets it for Islam
though,

819
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,520
right?
Because that's the truth of it.

820
00:35:19,521 --> 00:35:22,550
Like this is a guy who wrote a letter to
a Christian nation.

821
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:25,970
Guess what it was about Christianity.
Nobody called him a Christian.

822
00:35:25,971 --> 00:35:26,660
A phobe,
right?

823
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:31,810
So when Bill Maher,
so that night then the whole thing all 

824
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,290
hell broke loose with athletic on unreal
time or heaven.

825
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:35,180
Heaven broke loose,
right?

826
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:36,170
Exactly.
Uh,

827
00:35:36,171 --> 00:35:38,220
whatever you want to call it.
Some imaginary bullshit.

828
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,600
Um,
that night.

829
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,420
And I know we both talked about this at 
time,

830
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:46,820
but what happened was athletic 
immediately went to the social justice 

831
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,170
warrior.
I'm holier than thou,

832
00:35:49,171 --> 00:35:52,980
I'm going to portray,
protect the downtrodden thing,

833
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,260
right,
and it was nonsense and bullshit.

834
00:35:55,261 --> 00:35:56,730
Sam Sat there.
Again,

835
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:59,160
you can disagree with the premise of 
what he says.

836
00:35:59,161 --> 00:36:03,240
You can disagree with his feelings on 
profiling or nuclear first strike,

837
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:08,390
but he'll debate all of those.
I sat with him for an hour and a half 

838
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:08,550
and he would have done three hours,
but our crew guys had to leave.

839
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:13,551
I mean,
this is a guy who will stake out these 

840
00:36:13,551 --> 00:36:16,281
positions and unpopular positions and 
put them out there and they just want to

841
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:21,741
shout him down and what the.
What the real thing though is it's the 

842
00:36:21,741 --> 00:36:21,870
chilling effect on that.
Is that what?

843
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,220
It's not about shutting down,
Sam.

844
00:36:23,221 --> 00:36:28,221
If Sam disappears tomorrow,
I think it would be really bad for our 

845
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:29,100
discourse as a country and I think this 
is a guy saying important shit,

846
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,220
but ultimately guess what?
They're going to come for Joe Rogan.

847
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:37,310
They're going to come for Dave Rubin and
they're going to come for all the other 

848
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:37,310
people that are tweeting about

849
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:40,180
and what they're really doing is just 
trying to take the moral high ground.

850
00:36:40,181 --> 00:36:42,370
They're trying to teach you some more 
shit of being like.

851
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,270
First of all,
if,

852
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:47,350
if Ben Affleck had a real nuanced and 
objective position,

853
00:36:47,351 --> 00:36:48,880
he certainly didn't express it on that 
show.

854
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:51,370
You mean racist,
racist.

855
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,160
He's a fucking idiot.
It really is a fucking idiot.

856
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:59,200
You know?
I don't know that I can go see that 

857
00:36:59,200 --> 00:36:59,200
Batman movie because he,
I,

858
00:36:59,200 --> 00:36:59,210
he has turned me.
I love superhero movies.

859
00:36:59,211 --> 00:37:00,070
Love them.
With that.

860
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:00,400
The

861
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,400
fact that he was willing to take that 
position on a show like that and argue 

862
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:05,980
with that without,
without.

863
00:37:05,981 --> 00:37:06,850
I mean,
first of all,

864
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:12,090
I like Bill Maher.
I think he's a very funny comic that 

865
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:12,160
show socks.
This is.

866
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,310
This is why I like it a lot.
It's like socks.

867
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,840
It's doesn't suck because it's a sucky 
show.

868
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,960
It sucks because all these subjects are 
massively important and have a bunch of 

869
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,390
people shouting over each other.
Like here,

870
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:27,510
like you and I have very strong opinions
and we want to express ourselves and 

871
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:27,510
there's only two of us luckily because 
it was,

872
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,580
if there was five of us in the room 
right now and we're all talking,

873
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:34,390
it would be really hard to fucking get 
your points across because you've got to

874
00:37:34,391 --> 00:37:36,050
kind of like jump in and,
and,

875
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:41,190
and this is what happens when you get a 
guy like Sam Harris and a guy like Ben 

876
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,460
Affleck and Ben Affleck,
which you're saying you're so racist,

877
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:42,630
right?

878
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,450
So racist.
Right?

879
00:37:43,451 --> 00:37:45,190
Instead of having an hour to go,
okay,

880
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:50,670
well why don't you tell me why it's 
racist and give me your thoughts in the 

881
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,550
Middle East and tell me what you would 
do about,

882
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:56,670
you know,
x amount of people who are so entangled 

883
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:59,650
in their ideology that they want death 
upon people.

884
00:37:59,651 --> 00:38:01,660
They wish death upon people who leave 
the religion.

885
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,340
Yeah.
Tell me what you would do about that.

886
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:08,490
Tell me what you do about people that 
think that it's wrong to have women go 

887
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:09,700
to school.
Tell me what you would do about.

888
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:14,620
We're talking about ideologies.
You can call it Islam,

889
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,570
you can call it the moonies,
you can call it,

890
00:38:16,571 --> 00:38:18,430
scientology,
can call it whatever the fuck you want,

891
00:38:18,431 --> 00:38:22,750
but what it really is is a rigid set of 
ideologies.

892
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:27,990
It's these are ideologies that you are 
forced to subscribe to a predetermined 

893
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:30,730
pattern of behavior and thinking,
and if you are not in that predetermined

894
00:38:30,731 --> 00:38:35,731
pattern of behavior and thinking they 
wished death upon you and they think 

895
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:36,640
that they should be able stone you.
If you're a homosexual,

896
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,560
they should be able to stone you.
If you're an adulterer,

897
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,680
there's a horrible video online of this 
poor woman whose father throws the first

898
00:38:44,051 --> 00:38:45,190
rock.
I've seen it.

899
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,440
Have you seen it?
I've seen it.

900
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,510
She wants to touch him before,
before he kills her and he,

901
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,850
he won't touch her hand and he hits her 
with the rock.

902
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,490
But think about the absurd.
So there's,

903
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,610
there's so much here,
right?

904
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:57,880
So thinking about the absurdity of this,
that the hatred for these people,

905
00:38:57,881 --> 00:38:59,890
the hatred for Sam,
for Bill Maher.

906
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:03,130
So whether you like them or not,
when I say it sucks,

907
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:08,310
what I know is that the constructs,
all those talk show format suck those 

908
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:12,540
splitscreen,
but bill o'reilly things bill talks and 

909
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:12,820
three experts shot.
We'll be right back.

910
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,920
It's just not enough time.
I look,

911
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:20,370
Bill Maher loves Bernie Sanders.
Obviously he had them on the show last 

912
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:20,370
week.

913
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:20,370
He only had six minutes with.
That's crazy.

914
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,110
Imagine what year you would do with that
guy.

915
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:28,111
If he was here right now we could.
We could literally talk all day and he 

916
00:39:28,111 --> 00:39:31,861
should and he should and should have a 
show like that where it's just bill 

917
00:39:31,861 --> 00:39:36,810
sitting down with these people and not 
being forced into that fucking 

918
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:39,340
soundbitey type of conversation because 
that's what they're doing.

919
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,150
Well listen,
I love bill,

920
00:39:40,151 --> 00:39:41,740
but I'll do that.
You'll have that that day,

921
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:46,060
so thank you for that and you'll be 
fucking let him.

922
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:51,540
That's fine.
I just think that format is like 

923
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:51,540
everybody thinks that everybody needs to
be like fast,

924
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:51,820
fast,
fast,

925
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:53,620
fast.
It's not the case.

926
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:58,770
Well look,
I think both of us are proof that it's 

927
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,781
not the kids.
I think for a long time everything was 

928
00:40:00,781 --> 00:40:00,781
getting smaller and smaller.
The Internet burst.

929
00:40:00,781 --> 00:40:02,790
This thing twitter came out,
we're going to talk in 140 characters.

930
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,230
Buying came at six seconds,
so everything kept getting smaller,

931
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:05,920
smaller,
smaller.

932
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:11,130
But what I'm absolutely seeing now,
we've only been doing my show in its 

933
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,760
current incarnation for two months.
Sam was my first guest.

934
00:40:12,761 --> 00:40:16,600
This was the first week in September and
we started doing long form stuff again,

935
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:19,230
exactly what you're doing here.
And what I've seen is the more,

936
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,600
the longer we go,
the more we extrapolate ideas,

937
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,820
talk about stuff and don't scream at 
each other.

938
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:30,060
I'm bringing on people on the right and 
on the left and the more that we do 

939
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,060
this,
the more people want.

940
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,040
So I think there's a bounce back now 
from that short thing,

941
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,930
you know,
where everybody on television,

942
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:35,500
they start,
you know,

943
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:38,050
and it's partly like a show that I love 
on espn.

944
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,020
Pardon the interruption.
And they would have the countdown going,

945
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,670
you know,
and everything had to be quick,

946
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:43,000
quick,
quick,

947
00:40:43,001 --> 00:40:43,510
quick,
quick.

948
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:47,260
But I think people are actually ready 
for this.

949
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,850
And,
and I think clearly,

950
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:53,851
and I don't think it,
I mean that's why this is working for 

951
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:53,851
you.
You know what I mean?

952
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:54,220
People want to actually hear a couple of
thoughts.

953
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:59,221
Let's hear two things that don't 
necessarily line up and let's hear 

954
00:40:59,221 --> 00:41:02,190
people that I listen.
I hope that plenty of people that will 

955
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:02,740
be listening to this will disagree with 
me,

956
00:41:02,741 --> 00:41:05,020
will disagree with you.
And at the end we'll go,

957
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:10,021
well it's not because they're racist,
but they got some ideas that let's 

958
00:41:10,021 --> 00:41:12,070
challenge those ideas.
Well I think the entertainment aspect of

959
00:41:12,071 --> 00:41:17,071
those shows where there's like five 
people in a room and then also you have 

960
00:41:17,071 --> 00:41:20,590
a fucking audience that cheers and they 
agree and some and some of them are just

961
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:25,420
so lefty,
so super fucking applauding and every.

962
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,990
Because he shuts up his own audience,
which,

963
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,730
how many Qa?

964
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:33,930
I've literally seen him do standup where
he's yelled at the audience for giving 

965
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:33,930
him applause breaks.
I mean,

966
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,690
how many times have you ever seen that 
in a comedy show?

967
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:36,960
That that's pretty good.
We,

968
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:37,590
yeah,
in,

969
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,880
during his show,
he does do that with people chime in,

970
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:44,940
but I just think that the entertainment 
aspect of,

971
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
of expressing yourself almost sometimes 
takes precedent over the concepts and 

972
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:55,121
the ideas themselves because it's all in
how you deliver it and how forcefully 

973
00:41:55,121 --> 00:41:57,260
you can get it past the other people 
that are trying to say contrary points.

974
00:41:57,261 --> 00:42:02,261
So the Ben Affleck thing is the perfect 
example of that because by yelling out 

975
00:42:02,261 --> 00:42:03,080
gross and racist within a minute.
Right.

976
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,780
So think about it.
It's pretty much the worst thing you can

977
00:42:05,781 --> 00:42:07,490
say about somebody right to call them 
racist.

978
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:08,480
That's pretty,
you know,

979
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,980
beyond you're a child molester or 
something.

980
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,600
It's pretty much the worst thing you can
say.

981
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,450
Think about if you were having an 
argument with somebody about,

982
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:19,530
about this stuff,
let's say you were privately arguing 

983
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:19,530
with someone about Islam and religion 
and blah blah,

984
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:24,161
blah.
It would take a while for you to call 

985
00:42:24,161 --> 00:42:24,161
them racist,
right?

986
00:42:24,161 --> 00:42:27,380
Like you wouldn't do it to go pretty 
deep by the time that you personally got

987
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:32,381
there,
to that place where you were to say you 

988
00:42:32,381 --> 00:42:32,381
are racist.
I don't think I would even,

989
00:42:32,381 --> 00:42:35,150
I would probably say that idea is 
racist.

990
00:42:35,151 --> 00:42:40,151
Right?
So that would even say your racist 

991
00:42:40,151 --> 00:42:40,670
because I got to think that like some 
people will say,

992
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:41,840
wow,
I have black friends.

993
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,460
Well what do you like about black 
people?

994
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:45,800
You know,
like you go into that for and at the end

995
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,180
of it,
well they smell different.

996
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,730
I like to be around people that are done
with me.

997
00:42:49,731 --> 00:42:50,810
Okay.
You're a fucking racist.

998
00:42:50,811 --> 00:42:51,410
You're a racist.

999
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,070
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1000
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:52,700
Like,
but,

1001
00:42:52,701 --> 00:42:57,701
but that illustrates your point 
perfectly that the problem with these 

1002
00:42:57,701 --> 00:43:00,611
shows and the problem with this 
discussion and problem with social 

1003
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:03,311
justice,
it's all like a perfect storm of 

1004
00:43:03,311 --> 00:43:04,550
craziness because the next day after 
that show,

1005
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,640
all the online sites mediate everybody.
The headlines were all Ben Affleck Calls

1006
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:15,401
Bill Maher and Sam Harris Racist.
So suddenly the onus was on them to 

1007
00:43:15,401 --> 00:43:17,960
prove that they are not raised exactly.
That is not only is that bonkers,

1008
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:22,961
but I asked them about this and he,
he said something that I thought was 

1009
00:43:22,961 --> 00:43:25,511
fascinating.
He was on that show to discuss his book 

1010
00:43:25,511 --> 00:43:27,740
called Waking Up,
which is a spiritual guide to a guide to

1011
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:30,900
spirituality without religion.
So he's talking about meditation.

1012
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:32,690
He's talking about inner peace.
I've read the book,

1013
00:43:32,691 --> 00:43:34,640
you know,
like some pretty lofty stuff.

1014
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,710
He said,
from that point forward,

1015
00:43:36,711 --> 00:43:40,400
the next six months in my life,
we're on a book tour about inner peace,

1016
00:43:40,401 --> 00:43:43,850
but all I had to do is defend myself 
that I'm not a racist.

1017
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:47,960
How cosmically war that is.
Well,

1018
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:52,150
and it came from,
I believe Ben Affleck wanting to state a

1019
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,160
position that he felt would be very 
popular and when resonate it would get 

1020
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,390
him social brownie points because that's
what he did.

1021
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,950
What he said,
the way they express themselves.

1022
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:05,980
It's not nuanced.
It's not objective is not complex and 

1023
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:09,221
well thought out and it's a very,
very deep and important subject and 

1024
00:44:09,221 --> 00:44:12,951
massively important subject because what
we're talking about in 2015 when you 

1025
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:16,830
talking about any ancient religion,
you're talking about clinging to these 

1026
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:21,221
ideas that were formed and ingrained in 
these communities well before science.

1027
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,370
Well before people had a deep 
understanding of human psychology.

1028
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:30,550
Of human nature of the power of 
suggestion and culture and well before 

1029
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:35,130
we understood the the world actually 
works as far as like as far as nature,

1030
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:40,131
as far as physics,
as far as just the formation of the 

1031
00:44:40,131 --> 00:44:40,131
universe.

1032
00:44:40,131 --> 00:44:43,370
All of this information is not 
applicable to most of the religions in 

1033
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:44,520
the world today.
Not only are you right,

1034
00:44:44,521 --> 00:44:49,521
but that's even what Sam wrote in and 
the faith that fat fucking Batman before

1035
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:55,371
the movie even came out,
the new Batman like think how insane 

1036
00:44:55,371 --> 00:44:56,340
that is.
If you really step back and dissect what

1037
00:44:56,341 --> 00:44:58,950
you just said there,
that if you took what the average person

1038
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,240
thought over the world and of science 
and medicine and everything that we know

1039
00:45:03,241 --> 00:45:08,241
of and food and everything in 1840 by 
that standard now in 2015,

1040
00:45:08,671 --> 00:45:13,671
that person would look pretty damn dumb,
but for some reason these books that 

1041
00:45:13,671 --> 00:45:16,050
were written thousands of years in 
whatever it is,

1042
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,960
somehow those have some validity that we
should still respect.

1043
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,300
We shouldn't respect these books.
They're ideas.

1044
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,090
They're ideas that time has long since 
let go of.

1045
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,840
So by respecting them,
we're actually doing something crazy.

1046
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,790
If we want,
if we really want to be free,

1047
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:34,791
if we want to be free thinkers and 
people that I don't give a fuck about 

1048
00:45:34,791 --> 00:45:36,570
anyone's race or religion or sex or 
sexuality,

1049
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:41,750
I judge people on what they say and what
they think and what the social justice 

1050
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:45,981
warriors are doing.
They're trying to win this argument by 

1051
00:45:45,981 --> 00:45:45,981
shutting everybody down.
Yes,

1052
00:45:45,981 --> 00:45:50,150
and they they're doing it.
I think there is a degree of them doing 

1053
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:53,220
it for lofty reasons.
I think Ben Affleck thinks in his lofty,

1054
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,020
rich Hollywood,
whatever,

1055
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:59,070
that he's helping the downtrodden.
I think there's something he does really

1056
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:02,220
know entirely circle.
You know why?

1057
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:05,130
Because I know too many actors and I 
know what they are and you know,

1058
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,540
here's.
Here's the thing about actors,

1059
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:08,520
and this is not all actors,
obviously just like,

1060
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:13,610
you know,
not all comics are heroin addicts and 

1061
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:13,610
drug addicts and whatever.

1062
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:16,910
I think that what it is to be an actor 
is to pretend to be something else.

1063
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:17,980
Right?
That's,

1064
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:23,060
that's what it is and it's also you have
to get passed the audition process and 

1065
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:26,130
the audition process is essentially 
saying all the right things.

1066
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:27,540
So Dave,
wherever you're from,

1067
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,340
where'd you grow up?
And you have to like,

1068
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,200
you know who you voted for this.
Like there's,

1069
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:36,230
there's that shit.
There's a reason why Hollywood liens 

1070
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:36,230
almost entirely left.
Right.

1071
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:40,011
Do you think they really do,
because I think a lot of them are 

1072
00:46:40,011 --> 00:46:40,011
secretly voting Republican taxes.
Right?

1073
00:46:40,011 --> 00:46:44,770
You know,
you've got your Charleston Heston's in 

1074
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:44,770
your fucking,
you know,

1075
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:48,251
there's,
there's a few John voight's out there 

1076
00:46:48,251 --> 00:46:50,451
and the guy from the was,
it will be back in two and two with a 

1077
00:46:50,451 --> 00:46:54,590
chuckle or chuck will follow him on 
twitter just to laugh at all the fucking

1078
00:46:54,691 --> 00:46:55,830
Republican Shit that he writes.

1079
00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:01,070
There's,
there's always gonna be a few Hollywood 

1080
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:02,871
conservatives.
Obviously Chuck woolery is not in any 

1081
00:47:02,871 --> 00:47:05,571
big movies like that,
but there always going to be a few 

1082
00:47:05,571 --> 00:47:06,600
conservatives in Hollywood.
The casting people,

1083
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:08,100
the PR,
the producers,

1084
00:47:08,101 --> 00:47:13,101
the executives overwhelmingly left 
leaning and to be in that club you have 

1085
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:18,090
to agree with them and there's a problem
with that whole audition process when it

1086
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:23,210
comes to actors.
You can't work unless someone approves 

1087
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:26,421
you,
unless someone takes you in and accepts 

1088
00:47:26,421 --> 00:47:26,421
you and chooses you.
Dave,

1089
00:47:26,421 --> 00:47:27,780
you're the right guy for the part.
Yes.

1090
00:47:27,781 --> 00:47:28,430
Yeah.
Now you're.

1091
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:30,760
And you can't say anything controversial

1092
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,930
that will fuck that up.
And then you're essentially like,

1093
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:36,520
you're on a dating program for the 
world.

1094
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:37,360
Not,
not dating,

1095
00:47:37,361 --> 00:47:42,361
like you're trying to get laid,
but like you're trying to get the world 

1096
00:47:42,361 --> 00:47:42,361
to love you.
Yeah.

1097
00:47:42,361 --> 00:47:42,361
So when a guy like Ben Affleck who's 
been doing this,

1098
00:47:42,361 --> 00:47:47,341
his whole life gets on that show and 
someone says something that he thinks I 

1099
00:47:47,341 --> 00:47:49,090
can get in here and make some fucking 
points.

1100
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:51,730
I can get some social brownie points up 
on the board.

1101
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:54,610
I think that's racist.
You're racist and this is gross.

1102
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:58,300
He's just like a guy at an audition.
He's full of Shit.

1103
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:01,190
You know what Rogan I'm going to prove 
to you right now that I,

1104
00:48:01,191 --> 00:48:02,370
uh,
I don't just say shit,

1105
00:48:02,371 --> 00:48:03,960
but I believe it because you've changed 
my mind.

1106
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:09,020
That argument was good enough that 
you've changed my mind that I do agree 

1107
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:12,171
that he wasn't doing it out of some 
lofty thing that it's purely that I'm 

1108
00:48:12,171 --> 00:48:12,171
with I,
there might be a,

1109
00:48:12,171 --> 00:48:16,990
you know,
maybe we can split hairs a little bit 

1110
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:16,990
and it's 80 slash 20 or whatever,
but I think that actually does make more

1111
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:21,531
sense and it also explains why it 
happened within a minute because he was 

1112
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:23,370
ready for it to happen before the 
segment even started.

1113
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,500
So yeah,
I'll go.

1114
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:29,530
I think there are also sociopath to get 
involved in philanthropic ventures to 

1115
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:30,650
make themselves look good.
Oh sure.

1116
00:48:30,651 --> 00:48:35,651
I absolutely 100 percent believe that 
some people do some philanthropic shit 

1117
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:37,690
so that it makes them look better.
And,

1118
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:38,810
and,
and this is,

1119
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:43,830
this is sort of to mask the psychosis 
that bubbles below the surface of their 

1120
00:48:44,511 --> 00:48:46,040
skin that they're trying to hide from 
people.

1121
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:48,920
Like you can't go after me.
I work with the firefighters,

1122
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:49,720
you know,
I'm,

1123
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:50,300
I'm,
I'm,

1124
00:48:50,301 --> 00:48:53,690
I support the first responders 
responders,

1125
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,070
you know,
I'm down with the firefighters.

1126
00:48:55,071 --> 00:48:58,250
You can't call me a plagiarist,
but you can like send Dusky,

1127
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:03,430
like we'll,
we'll be working with little kids 

1128
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:03,430
helping all these little kids won't 
securely.

1129
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:04,730
That guy's not fucking them.
How could he do that?

1130
00:49:04,731 --> 00:49:06,520
He loves the children.
I mean that,

1131
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,710
that is the kind of shit that happens 
with a lot evil

1132
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:10,210
people.
So this is interesting.

1133
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:14,500
So for comics then it really is 
particularly bizarre because there's the

1134
00:49:14,501 --> 00:49:15,610
approval thing,
right?

1135
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:18,160
And comics want approval just the same 
way actors,

1136
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:23,850
but comics are also the good ones and 
unfortunately there's not many of us 

1137
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:25,870
left that you're supposed to stake out 
controversial positions.

1138
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:29,440
So that goes against the sort of mass 
approval thing,

1139
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:33,490
but it doesn't in comedy but.
But right now he's counterculture.

1140
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,750
Cool.
Right now.

1141
00:49:34,751 --> 00:49:35,430
Does,
does any.

1142
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,870
Is there any comic.
There's a couple people I guess,

1143
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,820
that are doing some counterculture 
stuff.

1144
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:40,290
Okay.
Letter.

1145
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,840
Getting credit for find counterculture.
What counterculture that you'd be?

1146
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:46,830
You'd be really against the government.
You'd be against the administration,

1147
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:51,870
you know,
you'd be fighting more for some of the 

1148
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:53,941
things that I think we're doing with the
social justice where yourself fighting 

1149
00:49:53,941 --> 00:49:57,211
for free speech,
relentlessly fighting against bad ideas 

1150
00:49:57,211 --> 00:50:01,531
so you could be fighting against the 
ideas of Islam without being racist or 

1151
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:04,450
you're going to race,
but without even being,

1152
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,850
without being bigoted towards Muslim 
people.

1153
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:09,160
Like right now I think partially because
of Obama,

1154
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:12,130
it's cool to like the president,
you know what I mean?

1155
00:50:12,131 --> 00:50:13,660
Just by his,
by the.

1156
00:50:13,661 --> 00:50:15,040
He's black,
he's cool.

1157
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:20,041
I'd love to play basketball with him.
I'm sure he'd be fun to have a drink 

1158
00:50:20,041 --> 00:50:22,891
with.
So it's cool to like the power right 

1159
00:50:22,891 --> 00:50:22,891
now.
So in a weird way,

1160
00:50:22,891 --> 00:50:26,941
I think if we have a republican 
president next time comedy's going to 

1161
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:28,010
get a lot better real quick because it's
going to be a lot easier to

1162
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,230
attack.
But is it cool to like him?

1163
00:50:30,231 --> 00:50:34,280
If you look at the facts is a cool to 
like when you look at the ways attacked,

1164
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,590
whistleblowers is like nobody's talking 
about that.

1165
00:50:36,591 --> 00:50:37,910
That's my point.
People are,

1166
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,100
there's plenty of people are they are in
podcasts.

1167
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:40,950
Yeah,
yeah,

1168
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,360
I know a lot of really smart people that
are attacking it.

1169
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:45,770
All right,
well that guy's truck trussell,

1170
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,920
Duncan trussell Kurt Metzger.
I know a lot of like very smart comics 

1171
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,370
that just think it's fucking gross that 
you've got a guy that's killed more 

1172
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:57,050
innocent people with drones or been 
responsible for being the lead.

1173
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:02,200
The commander and chief of the greatest 
army in the world has ever known that 

1174
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,920
has caused thousands of people to die 
innocently through drone strikes.

1175
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:05,960
You know that like they're shooting it 
cell phones,

1176
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,570
they're shooting missiles at where a 
cell phone is and that's what,

1177
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,700
that's what metadata is.

1178
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:14,730
We just blew up that hospital,
blew up that hospital and you know,

1179
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:17,390
we could get into a whole thing about 
the,

1180
00:51:17,391 --> 00:51:19,020
about the Middle East,
but like there,

1181
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:24,040
there's terrible shit or the 
whistleblower thing I think is a good 

1182
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,520
spot because you hear Edward Snowden on 
um,

1183
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:26,960
uh,
Neil degrasse Tyson's show.

1184
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:27,650
No,
I didn't.

1185
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:29,270
You should listen to it.
It's amazing.

1186
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,600
It's great,
but please go look,

1187
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:34,850
that's what Obama is doing right now.
That's what he's doing.

1188
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,440
There's a reason that Obama,
you know,

1189
00:51:36,441 --> 00:51:37,970
a lot of people on the left,
the progressives,

1190
00:51:37,971 --> 00:51:39,860
when Obama got in immediately we're 
like,

1191
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:41,390
you know,
he has to try,

1192
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:46,391
you know,
Cheney for war crimes and Blah Blah 

1193
00:51:46,391 --> 00:51:46,391
Blah.
And there's a reason why he didn't.

1194
00:51:46,391 --> 00:51:50,140
That wasn't just about power.
It was also because he's killing a lot 

1195
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,080
of people with drones right now.
In 20 years from now,

1196
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:56,200
he doesn't want that president,
President Willow Smith or whoever it's 

1197
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:56,200
going to be to come in.

1198
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,440
And Samantha,
like j dot j.

1199
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:00,020
that's pink isn't going to win.
Probably.

1200
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:05,660
Maybe.
I guess Jayden probably would be the 

1201
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:05,660
president and curse there.
I don't know,

1202
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,560
but like whoever is going to be,
it's going to be one of them.

1203
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,330
I might vote for will.
How about that?

1204
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,030
You'd vote for.
Well,

1205
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,210
I had my vote for will smith.
Is he running?

1206
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:16,330
I don't know,
but he's a smart motherfucker and I 

1207
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:16,330
like,
I like when I listened to him talk,

1208
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:20,090
I think he's a balanced and intelligent 
guard that expresses himself very well.

1209
00:52:20,091 --> 00:52:24,470
He's extremely well read,
but it's not a scientologist A.

1210
00:52:24,471 --> 00:52:27,260
I don't think he's a scientologist,
but I think he's dabbled.

1211
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:29,180
So as Jerry Seinfeld,
they look.

1212
00:52:29,181 --> 00:52:31,460
I bought dianetics.
I bought it on an online,

1213
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:36,580
not even online.
I got it from one of those late night 

1214
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,120
infomercials in 1994 when I first moved 
to Hollywood.

1215
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:43,120
I remember those commercials all the 
time in the middle of the night for me 

1216
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,280
while I'm in the middle of Lawrence 
Wright's going clear hallways.

1217
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:45,800
I can read it for too long,
man.

1218
00:52:45,801 --> 00:52:48,770
I go to other books because I read it 
for like a few chapters and I go,

1219
00:52:48,771 --> 00:52:53,570
fuck this because it's so crazy.
The thing on Hbs,

1220
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:57,830
I started the book first,
then I watched the thing on hbo and then

1221
00:52:57,831 --> 00:52:59,750
I keep going back to the book,
but I haven't finished.

1222
00:52:59,751 --> 00:53:04,751
It's got.
It's got like probably I'm probably 

1223
00:53:04,751 --> 00:53:04,751
halfway in,
but I,

1224
00:53:04,751 --> 00:53:06,110
I,
I can't,

1225
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:07,520
you know,
it's weird about Kendall's.

1226
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:11,120
You don't see that you're halfway in.
You see numbers like I like,

1227
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:15,050
I like a thickness thing where I'm like,
I'm down to the bottom.

1228
00:53:15,051 --> 00:53:16,370
I got like a very thin.

1229
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,410
But even the numbers on that doesn't 
mean anything to me.

1230
00:53:21,411 --> 00:53:23,390
Those numbers at the bottom,
that show,

1231
00:53:23,391 --> 00:53:25,710
you know,
you're on page 100 and 500 pages.

1232
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:28,020
That's not,
it's not registering.

1233
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:33,080
How do you,
how do you decide if someone in this 

1234
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,091
space,
how much information to put in your 

1235
00:53:35,091 --> 00:53:37,251
brain?
Because that's one of the things that I 

1236
00:53:37,251 --> 00:53:37,251
choose.
Problem.

1237
00:53:37,251 --> 00:53:39,500
Yeah.
I struggle with this all the time 

1238
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,271
because I love politics and I,
I told you I've been going to the spin 

1239
00:53:41,271 --> 00:53:41,271
rooms.
We can talk about some politics stuff.

1240
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:46,310
Um,
and I love all that stuff and I love 

1241
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:48,381
current events and I love Middle East 
politics and I love talking about 

1242
00:53:48,381 --> 00:53:48,381
religion,
all of this shit.

1243
00:53:48,381 --> 00:53:48,780
Like I love all that.
That's what I'm here for,

1244
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:49,860
right?
I'm on this earth,

1245
00:53:49,861 --> 00:53:54,480
that's what I'm here for.
But I do find sometimes I can't.

1246
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:56,760
There's just too much coming into my 
brain.

1247
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:58,760
And then when you have my,
you know,

1248
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:02,070
sitting on the couch and I'm watching 
Seinfeld,

1249
00:54:02,071 --> 00:54:07,071
which I should be,
should be the time that I can shut my 

1250
00:54:07,071 --> 00:54:09,381
brain down,
write an episode that I've seen 150 

1251
00:54:09,381 --> 00:54:11,841
times before that I know every line 
coming out and I had my ipad and I have 

1252
00:54:12,001 --> 00:54:16,440
my iphone and my laptop there and I'm 
doing this and it's like,

1253
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:21,030
it's like minority report from health 
and I really struggled with that,

1254
00:54:21,031 --> 00:54:23,970
like shutting it down sometimes and you 
know,

1255
00:54:23,971 --> 00:54:28,971
I'm not even just talking about the 
devices but just actually the stuff 

1256
00:54:28,971 --> 00:54:31,620
putting in your brain all the time and 
you gotTa Know Your Shit,

1257
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:33,030
you know,
it's tough.

1258
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:38,150
Well,
fortunately I don't necessarily really 

1259
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,290
have to know my shit because you know,
your shit I'll have to do is say I'm not

1260
00:54:40,291 --> 00:54:42,600
sure about that and I'm okay because I'm
a comedian,

1261
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:43,290
right?

1262
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:44,850
We don't.
But you know what I mean,

1263
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:48,240
like especially in these sorts of 
conversations like you and I,

1264
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,870
we exchanged some emails about some 
stuff that'd be cool to talk about,

1265
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:54,750
but we don't have a format.
Obviously we're all over the place where

1266
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,960
gay discos and Ben Affleck's Douche and 
Bill Maher's formats are antiquated and 

1267
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,010
there's,
you can only have so much information in

1268
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:10,011
your head and this is part of the 
problem that I have with is going clear 

1269
00:55:10,011 --> 00:55:12,471
book.
Why keep going to it and then going to 

1270
00:55:12,471 --> 00:55:12,471
other shit.
It's because I feel like,

1271
00:55:12,471 --> 00:55:16,110
why am I fucking reading so much about 
this sociopath fucking nightmare,

1272
00:55:16,111 --> 00:55:18,250
crazy cult leader dude,
that,

1273
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:23,410
that,
that has formed this insane religion 

1274
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:26,640
because I can't.
Part of me can't put it down.

1275
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:31,820
Pardon me?
I started reading about all the crazy 

1276
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:33,441
shit that he did and how nutty this guy 
really was and how many people followed 

1277
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,830
his wacky ideas.

1278
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:40,550
That becomes fascinating.
Could be talking about scientology or 

1279
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:44,271
any religion.
I could some wacky guy with some crazy 

1280
00:55:44,271 --> 00:55:44,271
ideas.
That's a thought.

1281
00:55:44,271 --> 00:55:45,930
Somebody was talking to him.
Next thing you know.

1282
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:47,850
Yeah.
Well there wasn't a lot of cash.

1283
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,270
Well,
there's,

1284
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:53,450
you know,
obviously there's different ones and 

1285
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:53,450
some of them,
the followers,

1286
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,620
like Mormons are notoriously nice 
people.

1287
00:55:55,950 --> 00:56:00,950
I could tell that was one of the 
weirdest religions because there so 

1288
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:01,920
nice.
But then like if you go to Islam,

1289
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,190
Mohammed was a warlord.
Yeah.

1290
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:08,220
And it's got a very different type of 
religion when first of all,

1291
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:13,370
you're dealing with the environment that
these people live in is extremely 

1292
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,180
hostile as far as the temperature is 
extremely hot.

1293
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:16,020
The,
the,

1294
00:56:16,021 --> 00:56:18,510
the,
the battle for natural resources is very

1295
00:56:18,511 --> 00:56:19,950
difficult.
Is the end.

1296
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:24,130
You're also dealing with the cradle of 
civilization and I have this bit about

1297
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,110
Islam that it never really came to 
fruition,

1298
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:31,111
but the eye,
not even Islam but the Middle East 

1299
00:56:31,111 --> 00:56:32,791
rather.
But the Middle East is essentially like 

1300
00:56:32,791 --> 00:56:35,580
they're the townies of the world because
that's where culture was created and 

1301
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:38,920
everybody looked.
Human beings were created in Africa.

1302
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:42,520
That's where the first human beings came
from out by however method,

1303
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:43,400
whether you believe in heaven,

1304
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:48,590
illusion and the drop some shit.
A promethium fucking terrible to be 

1305
00:56:50,471 --> 00:56:52,720
good.
I wanted it to be good.

1306
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,180
I watched the beginning again,
you know,

1307
00:56:55,230 --> 00:57:00,230
with the,
with the guy and he comes down and he 

1308
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:00,230
splits the thing and I was like,
what?

1309
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:00,640
What?
What happened here?

1310
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,280
The idea is that he ceded the world with
his DNA and then he knew somehow or 

1311
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:06,580
another would develop and the human 
being.

1312
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:10,520
Why did shortlist ron not move a little 
to the left when the thing was falling?

1313
00:57:10,521 --> 00:57:11,910
Remember the end.
Oh yeah.

1314
00:57:11,911 --> 00:57:14,300
There's the giant ship and it's falling 
and all she has to do,

1315
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,850
she's running straight in the ships ball
in this way and it's slow.

1316
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:17,840
Real slow.

1317
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:19,610
I want you to do is go a little panic 
attack.

1318
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:22,550
She just freaked out.
She freaked out or panicked.

1319
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:25,550
I don't know this.
We can get into that all day.

1320
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,520
She made up for it in a Mad Max.
Yeah.

1321
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:28,740
That was awesome.
Um,

1322
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:30,110
what was my point?
What the fuck

1323
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:34,650
we're going took you somewhere there.
The beginning of the world.

1324
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:35,580
Mesopotamia

1325
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,640
came from this one.
The,

1326
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:39,170
the,
the,

1327
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,270
the most ancient version of a human 
being like,

1328
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:43,780
I think they think that we're in this 
current form,

1329
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:49,500
correct me if I'm wrong,
but I think they're thinking it's like 

1330
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:49,500
250,000
plus years,

1331
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,011
right?
So whatever that was at one point in 

1332
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:55,711
time,
they left Africa and a lot of them 

1333
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,590
settled in the Middle East.
Egypt of course is a part of Africa,

1334
00:57:56,591 --> 00:58:01,591
but it is in the Middle East officially,
and they spread out all throughout the 

1335
00:58:01,591 --> 00:58:01,670
country.
But the,

1336
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:04,750
the oldest,
what we know today as far as we know,

1337
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,390
the oldest written language,
the oldest,

1338
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,310
uh,
uh,

1339
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:14,340
agriculture,
the oldest government structure was 

1340
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:14,710
Sumir.
And that's where Iraq is,

1341
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:16,640
you know,
is you're dealing with like 6,000

1342
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,310
plus years ago.
That's,

1343
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:19,810
that's Iraq.
I mean,

1344
00:58:19,811 --> 00:58:20,750
that is,
that,

1345
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:23,890
that's the cradle of civilization.
It's a fucking shit hole,

1346
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:27,640
a crazy wacky,
fucked up civil war.

1347
00:58:27,641 --> 00:58:32,641
The Muslims are fighting,
the Muslims that she has and the 

1348
00:58:32,641 --> 00:58:33,490
Sudanese are blowing each other up on 
roadside bombs.

1349
00:58:33,491 --> 00:58:36,010
And it's chaos.
It's chaos.

1350
00:58:36,011 --> 00:58:41,011
And when you get to these parts of the 
world that are amongst the most ancient 

1351
00:58:41,011 --> 00:58:45,601
cultures,
you have what I call the echoes of 

1352
00:58:45,601 --> 00:58:48,241
savages is like the culture has lasted 
for so long and the reverberations of 

1353
00:58:50,411 --> 00:58:54,660
these ancient ideas that have been long 
disproven and they're still there,

1354
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:56,140
they're there,
permeated.

1355
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:56,340
Look,

1356
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:59,250
that's why the Middle East especially,
we could also talk about Israel,

1357
00:58:59,251 --> 00:59:04,170
Palestinian people and all of it is such
a cluster fuck because so you could take

1358
00:59:04,171 --> 00:59:07,380
someone like Sam who will talk about it 
from the religious part,

1359
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,690
right,
and he'll mostly blame religion and then

1360
00:59:09,691 --> 00:59:14,691
you can take a lot of my friends on the 
left and they say it's all geopolitics 

1361
00:59:14,691 --> 00:59:15,660
and they usually blame the United 
States.

1362
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,580
The truth is,
and as I said before,

1363
00:59:17,581 --> 00:59:22,581
we have to have two thoughts at once and
I know it's very hard for people to be 

1364
00:59:22,581 --> 00:59:22,581
able to do that.
It's both.

1365
00:59:22,581 --> 00:59:24,580
It is both in the most extreme ways.
Look,

1366
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:27,080
first of Iraq and Syria right now are 
not even countries.

1367
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:32,190
Your by any estimation of what a 
functioning country is that would 

1368
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:34,070
partake in the world thing,
nor is Libya.

1369
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:35,110
Libya is not in.
Look,

1370
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:38,900
we did think about Libya for second.
Obama did that.

1371
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,610
No Congressional authorization,
right?

1372
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:44,300
Everyone goes crazy on Bush about Iraq.
Now obviously in retrospect,

1373
00:59:44,301 --> 00:59:48,320
the Iraq war is pretty bad and you can 
clearly make a line to it led to Isis,

1374
00:59:48,321 --> 00:59:50,420
which then has now dba destabilize the 
whole thing,

1375
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,090
but he at least had congressional 
authorization.

1376
00:59:53,091 --> 00:59:56,600
Now maybe he lied where we know now know
that they were planting evidence and all

1377
00:59:56,601 --> 01:00:01,601
that,
but Obama went into Libya right when he 

1378
01:00:01,601 --> 01:00:02,480
became president with no congressional 
authorization.

1379
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,790
I have no idea what's going on in Libya 
right now.

1380
01:00:04,791 --> 01:00:05,720
Is it a,
is it a country?

1381
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:09,140
Have you seen a board Danes show on it?
The CNN show?

1382
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,610
Uh,
I don't think it has.

1383
01:00:10,611 --> 01:00:15,611
There been a Libyan just watching it 
last night about a Ethiopia that shows 

1384
01:00:15,611 --> 01:00:15,980
amazing.
Yeah,

1385
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:16,820
he's,
he's amazing.

1386
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,490
But you know,
it's,

1387
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:21,770
it was,
it was shit when Kadafi was running it,

1388
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:26,840
obviously it was a horrible,
horrible place and he was a terrible 

1389
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,040
evil dictator.
But when you remove a dictator,

1390
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:33,310
you create a vacuum and that vacuum gets
sucked up by people that want to try to 

1391
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:34,910
claim power.
Well,

1392
01:00:34,911 --> 01:00:39,911
this is,
this is the strange thing about the 

1393
01:00:39,911 --> 01:00:39,911
neocons,
right?

1394
01:00:39,911 --> 01:00:42,611
So neo-cons believed that we should use 
our American power to either nation 

1395
01:00:42,611 --> 01:00:44,780
build or you know,
like I know,

1396
01:00:44,781 --> 01:00:45,680
and everyone on the left,
they'll say,

1397
01:00:45,681 --> 01:00:50,681
well,
they're doing it because we want their 

1398
01:00:50,681 --> 01:00:50,681
natural resources.
Like it's again,

1399
01:00:50,681 --> 01:00:53,441
it's one of these things that there's a 
zillion reasons why everyone wants some 

1400
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:55,340
piece of that part of the world,
but people will say,

1401
01:00:55,341 --> 01:00:57,680
well,
Iraq was better off with Saddam.

1402
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:00,320
He was doing horrible things to his 
people.

1403
01:01:00,321 --> 01:01:03,010
He was using mustard gas on the,
on the courage,

1404
01:01:03,011 --> 01:01:04,430
right.
I think it was the Kurds.

1405
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,080
Um,
so we've,

1406
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:08,150
we've helped.
We backed leaders.

1407
01:01:08,151 --> 01:01:11,030
Mubarak in Egypt was our guy.
We backed him.

1408
01:01:11,031 --> 01:01:16,031
Then they overthrew him.
Then we backed the Muslim Brotherhood 

1409
01:01:16,031 --> 01:01:19,300
than they overthrew them.
Now we're backing another Mubarak I 

1410
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:19,300
like,
we just do.

1411
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,740
Our policies are all crazy.
It's all military industrial complex and

1412
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:24,770
it's just this endless cycle of 
craziness over there.

1413
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:29,860
I mean,
you can't get any crazier than having a 

1414
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:32,291
guy like Dick Cheney as the vice 
president who the CEO of Halliburton 

1415
01:01:32,291 --> 01:01:33,170
accompany the rebuilds places that we 
blow up.

1416
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:35,480
It sounds like a shorts and egor movie,
right?

1417
01:01:35,481 --> 01:01:40,481
Like he's the bad guy in shorts and 
acrimony from the eighties or the bad 

1418
01:01:40,481 --> 01:01:40,481
guy in Rambo.
I mean it's,

1419
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:43,490
it's almost so obvious and that's why we
can't believe it.

1420
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:48,840
You know,
it ain't because they're showing it to 

1421
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:48,840
us.
Exactly.

1422
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:48,840
Here's what it is,
guys.

1423
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:48,840
No big deal.
Halliburton,

1424
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:53,651
by the way,
they're doing a lot of shit in Iraq 

1425
01:01:53,651 --> 01:01:53,651
right now.
You think it's coincidence?

1426
01:01:53,651 --> 01:01:54,530
Not only that,
they got no bid contracts.

1427
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:59,590
Nobody has to bed.
They have other people who are 

1428
01:01:59,590 --> 01:01:59,870
competing.
What do we do?

1429
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,360
What do we,
what do we do?

1430
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:07,390
We hope that inflammation and the 
distribution of information that's 

1431
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:11,030
available today that was barely 
available when Bush was in office and we

1432
01:02:11,031 --> 01:02:16,031
hope that the spread of that and the 
understanding of that will balance out 

1433
01:02:16,031 --> 01:02:17,990
all this shit and I'm hoping that that's
the case with social justice warriors.

1434
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:20,160
I'm hoping that's the case with these 
right wing

1435
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:25,160
fucking fanatics that want to blow up 
and bomb and invade everything that 

1436
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:29,331
doesn't believe in Jesus.
I'm hoping that all that stuff gets 

1437
01:02:29,331 --> 01:02:32,631
balanced out because I think the amount 
of change that we've experienced in our 

1438
01:02:32,631 --> 01:02:35,160
lifetime is unprecedented cultural 
change information will change,

1439
01:02:35,161 --> 01:02:36,180
has been the big one.
The,

1440
01:02:36,181 --> 01:02:37,890
the,
the invention of the Internet.

1441
01:02:37,891 --> 01:02:40,800
I forget.
I fully believe that when we go back and

1442
01:02:40,801 --> 01:02:42,750
historians look at this point in time,
they,

1443
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:47,751
they see it as an explosion of change,
like a veritable explosion of ideas and 

1444
01:02:48,751 --> 01:02:52,500
have the ability to express themselves 
and your show represents that your,

1445
01:02:52,501 --> 01:02:55,140
your podcast represents that you don't 
have anybody telling you what to do.

1446
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:57,480
You can talk about whatever you want.
There's no,

1447
01:02:57,510 --> 01:03:00,270
there's no studio execs come in and go,
stop Dave.

1448
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,850
We've got to get off this subject.
Dave,

1449
01:03:02,851 --> 01:03:05,340
you can't talk about Ben Affleck.
We're doing a film with Ben.

1450
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:08,710
One of our subsidiaries is very upset 
with this and that and that.

1451
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:10,920
You know,
the affiliates are calling in right now.

1452
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:15,921
They want to cancel our program.
We're gonna have to figure out a way to 

1453
01:03:15,921 --> 01:03:16,290
do this better.
You said some bad things about abilify.

1454
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:21,540
Abilify is one of our new sponsors and 
you should ask your doctor about it 

1455
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:21,540
because maybe you need it.

1456
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:21,780
Yeah.
Then my cloud gets even bigger.

1457
01:03:21,781 --> 01:03:24,050
That's hanging over me all the time.
It's really important,

1458
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,260
but yeah.
I'm with you,

1459
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:28,500
but do you think we've gotten to a 
breaking point with that because I think

1460
01:03:28,501 --> 01:03:33,501
one of the.
One of the reasons that I wanted to do 

1461
01:03:33,501 --> 01:03:35,241
this with you and I've been harassing 
you to come on my show forever is 

1462
01:03:35,241 --> 01:03:37,941
because I see the things that we're 
talking about and our audiences are so 

1463
01:03:37,941 --> 01:03:38,280
interlaced.
Right?

1464
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:43,400
And I really,
really believe it has a lot to do with 

1465
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,130
the Sam thing,
but I think there's been.

1466
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:48,210
We're close to the tipping point of 
defeating the Social Justice Warriors.

1467
01:03:48,211 --> 01:03:50,910
I really think themselves right?
Well,

1468
01:03:50,911 --> 01:03:54,750
because because identity politics 
ultimately has to eat itself.

1469
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,770
That's the fatal flaw,
so that they'll take someone like Bernie

1470
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:03,000
Sanders who stands for every fucking 
progressive principle known to man.

1471
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:05,040
He doesn't want money in politics.

1472
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:08,430
He's everything that the left wants and 
what happens?

1473
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:13,640
He has black lives matter.
People grabbing the mic away from him a 

1474
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:14,910
month ago screaming.
He doesn't care enough about black lives

1475
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:17,160
when,
when there's no reason to believe that,

1476
01:04:17,161 --> 01:04:21,210
but if but if you parse everyone down to
their one issue,

1477
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:26,240
so if you say that these people are only
going to care about black lives matter 

1478
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,390
and these people are only going to care 
about abortion and these people are only

1479
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:29,580
going to care about Islam or whatever it
is,

1480
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:35,150
you ultimately your goal,
you're just a group of people who 

1481
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:36,510
ultimately have interests that have 
nothing to do with each other and you're

1482
01:04:36,511 --> 01:04:41,511
going to destroy each other and that's 
why I think the reaction to this is so 

1483
01:04:41,511 --> 01:04:43,260
good and so powerful and I think it's.
It's real.

1484
01:04:43,261 --> 01:04:44,610
It's happening right now.
I could feel it.

1485
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:47,060
Well when that black lives matter thing 
happened,

1486
01:04:47,061 --> 01:04:49,190
those girls were screaming and then he 
was saying,

1487
01:04:49,191 --> 01:04:51,290
we're going to give them the mic from 
afterwards.

1488
01:04:51,291 --> 01:04:56,291
Like what?
That is not how you get to express 

1489
01:04:56,291 --> 01:04:56,291
yourself.
That's not how you do it.

1490
01:04:56,291 --> 01:05:00,821
You don't interrupt and decide that your
message is more important than their 

1491
01:05:00,821 --> 01:05:00,821
mess.

1492
01:05:00,821 --> 01:05:01,880
Yeah,
and of course their format,

1493
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,520
their place with their microphone at the
same time.

1494
01:05:04,521 --> 01:05:09,521
What did they probably end up doing?
I don't have any empirical evidence on 

1495
01:05:09,521 --> 01:05:09,770
this,
but they probably ended up strengthening

1496
01:05:09,771 --> 01:05:11,720
the people that don't like them.
You see what this,

1497
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,820
what this is doing,
you know,

1498
01:05:13,821 --> 01:05:15,950
so there,
there's so much to it,

1499
01:05:15,951 --> 01:05:17,980
but that's why I really,
I the social justice

1500
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,150
warrior thing and it has a lot the Sam 
thing in the way that they treated him.

1501
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:23,210
I'm talking about,
you know,

1502
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,200
Glenn Greenwald and Reza and my former 
boss Janko.

1503
01:05:26,201 --> 01:05:31,201
I know you've had on here the way these 
people treated him in this dishonest 

1504
01:05:31,201 --> 01:05:32,770
attack on ideas that it came from the 
left.

1505
01:05:32,771 --> 01:05:34,330
We're supposed to debate ideas,
right?

1506
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:35,790
We're on the left.
So what are,

1507
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,740
what is liberalism stand for?
We believe in the debate of ideas.

1508
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,650
You can say the people on the right.
Well they're more dogmatic,

1509
01:05:41,651 --> 01:05:44,140
they're more religious.
They don't want to debate ideas.

1510
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:49,170
So I can't deal with those people.
The right went off the deep end a long 

1511
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:52,321
time ago,
but I have to care about as someone 

1512
01:05:52,321 --> 01:05:54,991
that's on the left and that believes in 
liberal principles and doesn't want to 

1513
01:05:54,991 --> 01:05:56,590
see days thrown off the roof in Syria 
and all of that shit doesn't mean I want

1514
01:05:56,591 --> 01:05:57,400
to invade Syria.

1515
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,570
Doesn't mean you don't want to nation 
build,

1516
01:05:58,810 --> 01:06:03,810
but I should be able to talk about that 
without being called a racist or 

1517
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:03,810
whatever it is.
And,

1518
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:05,110
and I think we've.
We've hit something here.

1519
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:10,170
I think one of the things that we've hit
is there are people that are balanced 

1520
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:15,450
and that are socially aware and that are
fun and interesting to talk to and then 

1521
01:06:16,481 --> 01:06:21,010
there's social retards and social 
retards that form on the left.

1522
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:25,480
They tend to be unbelievably aggressive 
and douchey about really good ideas.

1523
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:30,500
Yeah,
like whether it's black lives matter or 

1524
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,731
whether it's supporting gay rights or 
whether it's transgender rights or any 

1525
01:06:32,731 --> 01:06:35,791
of the ideas that I'm sure you and I 
could both agree with what they're doing

1526
01:06:35,921 --> 01:06:40,921
and the way they're doing it,
as they found something that gives them 

1527
01:06:40,921 --> 01:06:43,471
the green light to be an asshole and one
of the things they're doing in being an 

1528
01:06:43,471 --> 01:06:44,380
asshole is they're making up for being 
picked on.

1529
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:49,560
They're making up for being rejected.
They're making up for the abuse that 

1530
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:53,121
they've suffered at other people's hands
that have caused them to have this 

1531
01:06:53,121 --> 01:06:54,610
unbalanced social persona.
And that's what it's all about.

1532
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:57,550
It's about social retards with really 
good points.

1533
01:06:57,730 --> 01:06:59,080
Yeah,
I mean,

1534
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:00,190
yeah,
you're on it.

1535
01:07:00,191 --> 01:07:02,740
So you could use the gay rights thing as
a great example of that.

1536
01:07:02,741 --> 01:07:03,660
So,
you know,

1537
01:07:03,661 --> 01:07:08,661
look,
we didn't have gay marriage until 

1538
01:07:08,661 --> 01:07:08,661
officially it was June 26,
happened to be my birthday.

1539
01:07:08,661 --> 01:07:11,020
Congratulations on my,
on my birthday.

1540
01:07:11,021 --> 01:07:13,630
The Supreme Court said you're asking,
you know,

1541
01:07:13,631 --> 01:07:18,631
I was engaged already at the time,
but I kinda liked the idea of getting 

1542
01:07:18,631 --> 01:07:22,231
gay married when it wasn't fully legal 
because then I thought I'd be like 

1543
01:07:22,231 --> 01:07:22,231
running from the law or something like 
that.

1544
01:07:22,231 --> 01:07:23,430
Had some.
Yeah,

1545
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,630
I was going to be hunting a guy with one
arm,

1546
01:07:25,631 --> 01:07:26,610
you know,
who killed my wife.

1547
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:31,690
None of it made sense,
but I had this idea of something in my 

1548
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:31,690
head.
But anyway,

1549
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:32,050
if you take that,
that movement,

1550
01:07:32,051 --> 01:07:33,430
look,
it happened pretty damn quick.

1551
01:07:33,431 --> 01:07:35,020
I know gay people have wanted rights for
a long time,

1552
01:07:35,021 --> 01:07:40,021
but if you take the last five years,
the way this thing has evolved and now 

1553
01:07:40,021 --> 01:07:40,021
it's cool.
Look,

1554
01:07:40,021 --> 01:07:41,770
you're,
you're a straight white man.

1555
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,650
Pretty much the worst thing there is,
right?

1556
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:44,020
I mean,
that's,

1557
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:44,890
that's what I hear.
Yeah,

1558
01:07:44,891 --> 01:07:46,540
you're just awful.
Even sitting here,

1559
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:47,980
terrible person.
It's been,

1560
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,090
you know,
very grating for me.

1561
01:07:49,091 --> 01:07:51,370
But uh,
if you look at the gay rights thing,

1562
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:55,000
the left was all about it and I ended.
They love games,

1563
01:07:55,001 --> 01:07:56,620
they love gays,
they love gays.

1564
01:07:56,980 --> 01:08:01,980
But at the end of the day,
now gays have equal rights and I know 

1565
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:01,980
there's still job issues and there's 
some stuff,

1566
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,640
but we got that fucking lady in Kentucky
that.

1567
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:04,870
Yeah.
Oh we can.

1568
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:07,930
Right.
So there's still all kinds of shit.

1569
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,930
I don't mean to say that everything's 
perfect.

1570
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:12,070
Resistance for the point is the Supreme 
Court,

1571
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:15,130
the law of the land now is equal in 
terms of marriage.

1572
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:21,130
But what I realized sort of halfway 
through that was it's not that the left 

1573
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:24,851
really cares about gays as much as sort 
of this idea sort of of what you're 

1574
01:08:25,071 --> 01:08:26,690
talking about.
Because at the end of the day,

1575
01:08:26,691 --> 01:08:29,420
now that gay people have equality,
well guess what?

1576
01:08:29,421 --> 01:08:33,540
Suddenly gay people might start voting 
Republican because they might monitor,

1577
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,100
vote on taxes.
They might,

1578
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:35,870
they might,
you know.

1579
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:40,160
So the identity politics thing is only 
good for a little while.

1580
01:08:40,161 --> 01:08:43,190
And then once everyone's equal,
it's,

1581
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:48,210
it's just,
it's just a way of pitting people 

1582
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:48,210
against each other.
Yeah.

1583
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:49,760
Then you really just become a fat person
with pink hair.

1584
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,140
Yeah.
That's all you are.

1585
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:57,080
You're not this amazing person with this
moral high ground that stands above and 

1586
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:01,061
gets to proclaim how they've been 
fighting for rights and screaming and 

1587
01:09:01,061 --> 01:09:01,061
yelling,
crying.

1588
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:03,580
You're screaming and yelling and crying 
because you're socially retarded because

1589
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:05,030
why are these people,
by the way,

1590
01:09:05,031 --> 01:09:08,000
why are they all anonymous if there so 
lofty in there?

1591
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:08,780
No,
no.

1592
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:10,580
I mean,
I know there's public ones,

1593
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:13,040
but I'm not talking about that,
but I mean the people that'll be yelling

1594
01:09:13,041 --> 01:09:15,130
at me over some social justice yet.
What are some.

1595
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,880
The writers were so.
Oh yeah,

1596
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:18,830
but that's what I mean.
I'm not defending.

1597
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:21,860
I think people sort of think that 
somehow I'm defending the right.

1598
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,820
There is nothing.
I agree with these people on.

1599
01:09:24,821 --> 01:09:27,950
You know what I mean?
I have to clean my house and my house is

1600
01:09:27,951 --> 01:09:30,290
on the left,
so I want the left to be better.

1601
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:32,990
I fully believe now that the 
regressives,

1602
01:09:32,991 --> 01:09:37,991
which is what the progressives have 
become because their ideas are now 

1603
01:09:37,991 --> 01:09:38,120
regressive,
not progressive,

1604
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:42,020
that they are the tea party of the left 
and if the Republicans,

1605
01:09:42,021 --> 01:09:44,480
if the average conservative,
whether you agree with them or not.

1606
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:50,080
Five years ago when the tea party was 
gaining strength and we're not going to 

1607
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:50,960
negotiate with anyone in government shut
downs and all that,

1608
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:53,840
if the average conservative had said,
these are our principles,

1609
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,060
whether you agree or not,
we believe in limited government,

1610
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:57,890
all of that stuff,
low taxes,

1611
01:09:57,891 --> 01:10:02,891
whatever strong defense,
if they would have said that they might 

1612
01:10:02,891 --> 01:10:03,620
have been able to reel the tea party and
a little bit,

1613
01:10:03,621 --> 01:10:05,930
but instead they just went to their 
worst,

1614
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:10,850
the worst piece of them and I see it 
happening with us on the left and that's

1615
01:10:10,851 --> 01:10:12,650
why I'm so against the regressive left.

1616
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:17,650
We got to bring them back because 
otherwise we're going to have the 

1617
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:17,650
regressive left and we're gonna have the
tea party and guess what?

1618
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:19,520
The GIG is up.
Yeah,

1619
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:20,270
I,
I agree,

1620
01:10:20,271 --> 01:10:23,360
but I think that is what you find in the
universe.

1621
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:28,660
You find this extremely broad range.
You find a spectrum and that spectrum 

1622
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:34,270
you have completely psychotic on one 
side and completely psychotic horseshoe 

1623
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:34,570
thing.
Right?

1624
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,260
And then at the end they're the same.
Yeah.

1625
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:38,270
And then this,
it really is.

1626
01:10:38,271 --> 01:10:38,990
I mean,
and then there's,

1627
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:40,880
there's a balance and I think that a lot
of,

1628
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:46,900
I think a lot of us given different 
circumstances could be swayed to have 

1629
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,040
different points of view and different 
ideas and I,

1630
01:10:48,041 --> 01:10:52,280
I'm also polled,
not in a sense like logically,

1631
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:57,170
but I find myself compelled when I see 
people that are really religious.

1632
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:02,320
When I listened to like some Muslim guy 
that's speaking with great confidence 

1633
01:11:02,901 --> 01:11:05,180
and the power of Islam and the truth of 
Islam,

1634
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:06,620
I find myself compelled.

1635
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:08,360
I don't believe it.
I don't,

1636
01:11:08,361 --> 01:11:13,361
I don't support it as an ideology,
but I'm fascinating by the natural 

1637
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:18,390
compulsion to want to join that.
The natural human.

1638
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:23,470
Like there's something about someone who
is unbelievably confident in what 

1639
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:27,141
they're doing is the right thing and is,
is proclaiming it publicly and loudly 

1640
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,360
through a microphone that makes you go,
wow,

1641
01:11:30,361 --> 01:11:32,670
maybe he's right.
Islam is the truth.

1642
01:11:32,671 --> 01:11:35,560
And kinda like hit like exactly like 
his.

1643
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:40,730
But that's.
But that's why it's a human nature 

1644
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:40,730
thing.
It is human nature.

1645
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:43,941
And look if,
if that's why they attract all these 

1646
01:11:43,941 --> 01:11:46,761
people,
there's no doubt that that's what's 

1647
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:46,761
going on here.
And what we have to do,

1648
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:51,620
listen,
I don't know what's going on in the 

1649
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:51,620
universe in the scheme of I have no 
freaking idea,

1650
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,350
but that doesn't,
that's fertile ground for someone having

1651
01:11:55,351 --> 01:11:56,790
to make that leap of faith and being 
like,

1652
01:11:56,990 --> 01:11:58,050
I don't have any idea.

1653
01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:03,050
So yeah,
just say I'm going to follow the Ten 

1654
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:03,050
Commandments.
I mean I'm pretty much.

1655
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:04,740
Well I don't believe in religion in any 
way whatsoever,

1656
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,750
but I get.
If we were to have the 10 commandments,

1657
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:11,770
I'm probably sure I'm pretty much 
following them because they're just 

1658
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:11,770
basic.
I don't kill people.

1659
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:14,430
I don't covet your neighbor's wife.
That's a gay thing.

1660
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:19,431
But you know,
like there was actually a property 

1661
01:12:19,431 --> 01:12:19,431
thing,
you know,

1662
01:12:19,431 --> 01:12:22,170
it was his property.
You by covenant taking her.

1663
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:22,850
Yeah.
But,

1664
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:27,880
but I mean the point is that you can 
live your life as I think both of us do 

1665
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:28,950
and probably most of your listeners do 
buy.

1666
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:34,000
You can have a set of principles that 
has nothing to do with religion and 

1667
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:34,830
which is what waking up is about.
Yeah,

1668
01:12:34,831 --> 01:12:37,300
that's exactly what we're about.
And that's,

1669
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:39,600
that's the crazy part of what the left 
is doing here,

1670
01:12:39,601 --> 01:12:44,601
you know,
there's this onslaught against new 

1671
01:12:44,601 --> 01:12:46,821
atheist,
so against Sam and Richard Dawkins and 

1672
01:12:46,821 --> 01:12:47,580
uh,
and hitchins even though he's not around

1673
01:12:47,581 --> 01:12:48,030
anymore.

1674
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:51,390
And I didn't know what new atheists were
even.

1675
01:12:51,391 --> 01:12:53,490
So I started asking some people in,
my friend Kyle said,

1676
01:12:53,491 --> 01:12:58,491
he said,
I think it's just an atheist who's 

1677
01:12:58,491 --> 01:12:59,850
finally saying I'm here because for a 
long time atheist wouldn't even say that

1678
01:12:59,851 --> 01:13:04,851
they were here.
And now you have the far left is the 

1679
01:13:04,851 --> 01:13:08,301
ones that are attacking atheist.
Isn't it supposed to be the far right 

1680
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:09,750
attacking the people who don't want 
anything to do with religion?

1681
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:11,630
It's incredibly warm.
Yeah.

1682
01:13:11,631 --> 01:13:14,370
It is incredibly warm ups and it doesn't
make any sense whatsoever.

1683
01:13:14,371 --> 01:13:16,310
And there was a real really recent,
um,

1684
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,260
have you seen Sam Harris's,
uh,

1685
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,310
there's something I tweeted a few days 
ago,

1686
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:23,640
Sam Harris on.
It's on something called secular talk.

1687
01:13:23,641 --> 01:13:24,320
It's on youtube.
Yeah.

1688
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:26,810
So Kyle is the guy that I just,
uh,

1689
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:29,010
he's the friend that said to me about 
the new atheist thing.

1690
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:34,370
So they picked up basically where our 
conversation ended because when I did 

1691
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:34,800
that and that.

1692
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:35,910
You're gonna play clip.
No,

1693
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:36,410
no,
I'm not.

1694
01:13:36,411 --> 01:13:39,330
But I was going to say that Sam snapped.
He snapped.

1695
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,790
I wouldn't say snap,
but by his Breton.

1696
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:43,200
Yeah.
He said snapped.

1697
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:44,400
Yeah.
That's how he described it too.

1698
01:13:44,401 --> 01:13:48,960
But he expressed himself about what's 
really going on with these people,

1699
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:54,200
whether it's Greenwald or I'll let him 
pick who it was and what it was.

1700
01:13:55,051 --> 01:13:57,060
But if you listen to it,
it's the thing,

1701
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:57,500
the,
the,

1702
01:13:57,790 --> 01:14:02,790
the channel on Youtube called secular 
talk and the title of it is Sam Harris 

1703
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:04,530
on progressivism torture,
religion and foreign policy.

1704
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:07,230
It's fucking fantastic because he's so 
elegant,

1705
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:08,910
so eloquent,
elegant as well,

1706
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:12,400
but eloquent.
And he just nails perfectly

1707
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:15,460
expressed what's going on.
So is that the inherent problem then?

1708
01:14:15,461 --> 01:14:17,920
Because what I see when I did my sit 
down with him,

1709
01:14:17,921 --> 01:14:19,390
I laid it out very clearly.
I said to him,

1710
01:14:19,391 --> 01:14:24,391
Sam,
let's take the five things that people 

1711
01:14:24,391 --> 01:14:26,191
misquote you about the most and let's 
make it very youtube friendly so that 

1712
01:14:26,191 --> 01:14:26,410
when these crazy people are screaming 
about you,

1713
01:14:26,411 --> 01:14:28,570
anyone on twitter can be like,
here's a link.

1714
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:31,900
Give it five minutes.
So we did it and he laid out a,

1715
01:14:31,901 --> 01:14:32,790
you know,
the profiling.

1716
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,040
He laid out the nuclear first strike.
He laid out all Muslims,

1717
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:37,450
verse Islam,
you know,

1718
01:14:37,451 --> 01:14:39,730
all that.
Islam is the mother lode of bad ideas,

1719
01:14:39,731 --> 01:14:41,470
which he did backtrack a little bit 
because again,

1720
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:43,480
it's about,
it's about ideas,

1721
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,340
not the slanders.
Right?

1722
01:14:45,341 --> 01:14:46,960
So that's how we laid it out.
And then we.

1723
01:14:46,961 --> 01:14:50,350
And then we did the whole thing and I 
felt when I was done with that,

1724
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:52,900
sit down again,
this was my first episode of my show.

1725
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:55,120
I was like,
I'm done with this topic.

1726
01:14:55,230 --> 01:14:57,970
I,
I felt I had added a little something to

1727
01:14:57,971 --> 01:15:02,971
this.
I had helped the discourse a little bit 

1728
01:15:02,971 --> 01:15:03,130
and then suddenly right after that,
they all were worse.

1729
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:07,820
I'll have Glenn Reza Jank.
They all double down.

1730
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:12,990
Literally.
Glen retweeted a misquote from our 

1731
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:17,851
interview that that Sam said it was 
something about Sam mentions profiling 

1732
01:15:17,851 --> 01:15:20,050
and he's talking about Jerry Seinfeld.
He's talking about Jerry Seinfeld,

1733
01:15:20,051 --> 01:15:25,051
the comedian Jerry Seinfeld should not 
be profiled that this is a guy who 

1734
01:15:25,051 --> 01:15:26,410
should be able to walk right through 
because it's a silly use of resources to

1735
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:32,580
Glen retweet something where they said 
people who look like Jerry Seinfeld 

1736
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:34,540
completely not what he said.
Well,

1737
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:36,910
first of all,
Jerry Seinfeld easily could be Arab,

1738
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:39,300
so that's I think one of his parents,
his Syrian.

1739
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:41,410
Actually,
that's a ridiculous thing to say,

1740
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,750
so not look like him.
By the way,

1741
01:15:43,751 --> 01:15:48,010
when Sam does the profiling and he talks
about how he should be profiled based on

1742
01:15:48,011 --> 01:15:50,050
his own looks because because he's a.

1743
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:53,890
he's a middle aged man and if a middle,
a middle aged white guy,

1744
01:15:53,891 --> 01:15:58,891
whatever.
He's not even talking about the race in 

1745
01:15:58,891 --> 01:15:58,891
this instance that if me or you,
if me and you,

1746
01:15:58,891 --> 01:16:01,930
we're right now going lax that we should
be profiled.

1747
01:16:01,931 --> 01:16:05,350
They should look at two guys of a 
certain age and whatever,

1748
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:09,790
whatever their criteria are.
Not based on race or religion,

1749
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,100
but there should be some more,
uh,

1750
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:16,360
they should look at us in a more curious
way than perhaps an eight year old Dutch

1751
01:16:16,361 --> 01:16:21,361
woman that's in a wheelchair or he's 
trying to have smart profiling or what 

1752
01:16:21,361 --> 01:16:25,621
he calls anti profiling.
The problem with profile really is 

1753
01:16:25,621 --> 01:16:27,100
you're getting profiled by people that 
are so fucking dumb.

1754
01:16:27,101 --> 01:16:28,630
They work for the TSA.
Right?

1755
01:16:28,631 --> 01:16:30,130
So that's,
that's a real issue.

1756
01:16:30,230 --> 01:16:32,290
As I read this whole thing that they 
give people,

1757
01:16:32,410 --> 01:16:34,720
like recognizing facial expressions,
like,

1758
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:36,130
get the fuck outta here.

1759
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:41,130
Have you ever.
You ever like paused for a minute when 

1760
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:42,520
you're looking for something and been a 
fly on the wall while the TSA agents are

1761
01:16:42,521 --> 01:16:45,650
talking to each other about what they 
want to eat or what this is saying.

1762
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:49,120
Any and barely paying any attention.
They're just folks work in a job,

1763
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:50,350
you know,
that's what they are.

1764
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:52,000
The folks that got a job.
Well,

1765
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:52,870
to that point,
I mean,

1766
01:16:52,871 --> 01:16:57,871
look,
if we really wanted to profile in the 

1767
01:16:57,871 --> 01:17:00,400
way that profiling should be done,
then you have to do it the way the 

1768
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:00,400
Israelis do it,
which is that you're,

1769
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:05,280
they have cameras on everybody watching 
every bit of body language and every bit

1770
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:08,730
of nuance.
I mean even I went,

1771
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,130
uh,
I went

1772
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:15,130
to Israel I think in 97 and I to get in,
had to go in a separate room and they 

1773
01:17:16,521 --> 01:17:19,340
asked me every question you could 
possibly think of.

1774
01:17:19,341 --> 01:17:21,830
I'm a Jew from long island.
I was profiled,

1775
01:17:21,831 --> 01:17:23,390
you know what I mean?
Like that.

1776
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:25,210
They're not doing it out of fun.
They're not,

1777
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,170
they just don't want their planes to 
explode.

1778
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,000
And I had to explain something about 
where my bar Mitzvah was.

1779
01:17:30,001 --> 01:17:35,001
I mean really crazy shit,
but I'm pretty sure they would prefer 

1780
01:17:35,001 --> 01:17:36,560
not to have to do that.
And I didn't walk away going,

1781
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:38,390
Oh man,
profiling like that.

1782
01:17:38,391 --> 01:17:41,090
That's the worst thing that world.
There are certain things that are these.

1783
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:46,120
This is a very difficult discussion to 
have because the social justice warriors

1784
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:48,350
make it so that even when we're talking 
about this now,

1785
01:17:48,351 --> 01:17:51,050
there's this feeling that somehow I'm 
before profiling,

1786
01:17:51,051 --> 01:17:52,970
I mean,
I think they should just be ignored.

1787
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:56,720
These so called social justice warriors,
and I think that as times going on,

1788
01:17:56,721 --> 01:17:59,630
they're becoming so ridiculous that 
they're either doing it to themselves.

1789
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:02,990
There was a great story that I tweeted a
couple of days ago,

1790
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:08,240
um,
antifeminist speaker disinvited to 

1791
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:11,530
uncomfortable learning in quotes,
lecture series a because she made 

1792
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:14,210
students uncomfortable but don't safe 
spaces.

1793
01:18:14,211 --> 01:18:19,211
But listen to this man.
The thing is called uncomfortable 

1794
01:18:19,211 --> 01:18:19,940
learning.
That is this the lecture series.

1795
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:24,200
And they disinvited her because she made
students uncomfortable.

1796
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:27,170
I mean,
this is fucking madness.

1797
01:18:27,171 --> 01:18:29,360
I mean,
this is exactly what we're talking about

1798
01:18:29,361 --> 01:18:30,080
here.
Also,

1799
01:18:30,081 --> 01:18:34,580
think how dangerous it is to do this to 
college kid more than anything else.

1800
01:18:34,581 --> 01:18:36,560
Because first off,
you're dragging the kids,

1801
01:18:36,561 --> 01:18:37,240
right?
We know,

1802
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:41,690
we know that they're all on Ritalin and 
all that shit right there on all that.

1803
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,930
Now they go to college.
Even the ones that aren't on that,

1804
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:48,940
you if they go to college,
college is supposed to be where you 

1805
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:51,581
figure out what your sort of base ideas 
are before you go out into the real 

1806
01:18:51,581 --> 01:18:51,581
world.

1807
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:52,640
If you're going to sign,
you know,

1808
01:18:52,641 --> 01:18:55,820
the college is Brandeis University 
silenced Ayaan Hirsi Ali.

1809
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:58,780
I have heard on my show next week like I
want to go into that.

1810
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,980
Like what?
Insanity.

1811
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:05,840
You know what I mean?
It's perverse at the highest.

1812
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:10,930
What is their dispute?
Because I think the argument was that 

1813
01:19:10,930 --> 01:19:12,410
she doesn't like Islam,
but she was raised in.

1814
01:19:12,411 --> 01:19:17,411
It almost killed her coworker van Gogh's
grandson or whatever was killed on the 

1815
01:19:17,451 --> 01:19:22,451
street in Holland for cartoon and she's 
talking about ideas again and this is 

1816
01:19:22,731 --> 01:19:24,920
what Sam says all time.
We have to talk about ideas,

1817
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:30,190
not people.
What other set of ideas would we be 

1818
01:19:30,190 --> 01:19:31,460
afraid to talk about?
What is going on in universities though?

1819
01:19:31,461 --> 01:19:33,910
Is it the students that are dictating 
the policy by,

1820
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:37,940
by protesting and is it the professors?
I think.

1821
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:42,970
I think it's coming from the professors 
partly for what you said before about 

1822
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:43,490
athletic,
like there's this idea if you want to be

1823
01:19:43,491 --> 01:19:48,491
a professor,
sort of in Gad said talks about this a 

1824
01:19:48,491 --> 01:19:50,741
lot because he is a college professor 
and I know he's had his struggles as 

1825
01:19:50,741 --> 01:19:50,930
someone that is outing this bullshit.

1826
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:53,180
I think he's had his professional 
struggles.

1827
01:19:53,470 --> 01:19:56,750
I think in our interview he talked a 
little bit about some exchanges he's had

1828
01:19:56,990 --> 01:20:01,990
with other professors where they don't 
want to touch some of his ideas because 

1829
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:05,680
of.
Not that he's talking about anything 

1830
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:05,680
really controversial at the end of the 
day,

1831
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:06,140
they don't want to touch it,
but it's because of the professor of the

1832
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:09,870
PR pressure from the students or is this
coming first?

1833
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:15,500
I think it's coming first from the 
professors or or even whatever is above 

1834
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:18,891
that.
I don't know if it's the 

1835
01:20:18,891 --> 01:20:18,891
administration's or even whatever is 
above that.

1836
01:20:18,891 --> 01:20:18,891
Like I don't know how high you have to 
go with it,

1837
01:20:18,891 --> 01:20:19,740
but I don't think it's the kids that are
doing it.

1838
01:20:19,741 --> 01:20:24,741
I think they are being fed shit and 
they're being fed fear and stupidity and

1839
01:20:25,471 --> 01:20:27,230
then they just bow,
you know,

1840
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:30,840
they just sort of rally around is also a
real problem in colleges.

1841
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:34,020
I believe that these people that operate
in academia,

1842
01:20:34,021 --> 01:20:38,190
I've only worked in Ghana and they don't
really understand the real world because

1843
01:20:38,191 --> 01:20:41,970
they aren't in it and they're in a 
position of power with young people,

1844
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:44,610
so their ideas have incredible 
influence.

1845
01:20:44,611 --> 01:20:47,640
They're standing on this stage,
teat teaching these lectures,

1846
01:20:47,850 --> 01:20:50,790
teaching these classes,
and they have these young impressionable

1847
01:20:50,791 --> 01:20:53,880
people that are listening to them just 
gives them a gigantic ego boost.

1848
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:57,540
They have this platform and they have 
never competed in the real world.

1849
01:20:57,690 --> 01:21:00,930
They've never contributed to the real 
world other than teaching children.

1850
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,890
And there's a lot of them like that that
have gone through the educational system

1851
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:10,010
and then gone from the educational 
system directly to teaching and then 

1852
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:13,690
this is their,
this is their universe and this is how 

1853
01:21:13,690 --> 01:21:14,700
they exist and these people are pretty 
much all part of the regressive left.

1854
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:17,130
They are pretty much all parties.
So if you could think,

1855
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:20,340
here's a simple example of this,
so there's a difference between debating

1856
01:21:20,341 --> 01:21:25,341
ideas and hate speech.
So let's say somebody that that hated 

1857
01:21:25,341 --> 01:21:29,241
Muslim people want it to speak at a 
college and it was going to talk about 

1858
01:21:29,241 --> 01:21:33,351
how we should kick them out of the 
country or we should whatever horrible 

1859
01:21:33,351 --> 01:21:38,090
things to them,
I could see absolutely protest that 

1860
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:41,061
person.
Use Your right of free speech and free 

1861
01:21:41,061 --> 01:21:43,710
assembly to protest that person's ideas.
Should the college not let them come.

1862
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,700
You know,
if it was purely hate,

1863
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:50,250
I suppose.
But I know that that's a really slippery

1864
01:21:50,251 --> 01:21:51,330
slope because everyone,
you know,

1865
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:56,370
versus you could take any of these 
people ion Hirsi Ali,

1866
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,940
she's not against Muslim people.
She's against the doctrine,

1867
01:21:59,941 --> 01:22:04,941
these ideas.
And if we can't make the distinction 

1868
01:22:04,941 --> 01:22:06,330
between hate speech and someone who 
wants to debate ideas,

1869
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:10,740
if you can't do that in college,
then where the hell else can you?

1870
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:15,740
Not only that,
try getting some inflammatory quotes by 

1871
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:19,880
Ian Hirsi Ali that you could argue 
against that aren't live really well 

1872
01:22:20,341 --> 01:22:22,230
thought out,
that aren't articulate,

1873
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:26,550
that aren't based on her personal 
experiences growing up in this religion.

1874
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:29,820
Her understanding of the scripture like 
try,

1875
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:35,000
try,
try finding some ignorant Hayden that 

1876
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:35,250
you're not going to.
These guys don't want to debate ideas.

1877
01:22:35,251 --> 01:22:38,820
It's really as simple as that.
So at the very personal level I can tell

1878
01:22:38,821 --> 01:22:39,980
you.
So you've had Janken.

1879
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:42,420
He was my former boss for two years at 
tyt.

1880
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:48,230
He watched the original thing with Sam 
and then sat down with him for three 

1881
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:49,950
hours.
Did you see any of that shit?

1882
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:52,080
I watched the whole thing.
Three hours.

1883
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:54,000
I watched that thing.
I was working for him at the time.

1884
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:59,570
Literally like my.
I was like this the entire time because 

1885
01:22:59,570 --> 01:23:02,840
I was having a headache because I could 
not believe that this person that I 

1886
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:04,500
worked for who I respect,
who I play basketball with every Sunday,

1887
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:10,500
that he was so dense to the ideas that 
Sam was portraying.

1888
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:15,280
And at the end of it,
just as I said to you before that at the

1889
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:16,660
end of mine,
I thought I had made this conversation a

1890
01:23:16,661 --> 01:23:21,661
little bit better.
Jank only doubled down on all of this 

1891
01:23:21,661 --> 01:23:22,540
shit because they don't want to debate 
ideas.

1892
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:27,600
They want,
they just want Sam to be discredited so 

1893
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,841
that their ideas when.
And that's why we have to fight against 

1894
01:23:30,841 --> 01:23:31,180
it.
Because if sam disappears,

1895
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:33,040
as I said earlier,
if Sam disappears tomorrow,

1896
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:38,041
it's not about him.
It's about all the ideas that will all 

1897
01:23:38,041 --> 01:23:38,680
be afraid to talk about.
That's why Charlie Hebdo cartoons,

1898
01:23:38,681 --> 01:23:41,200
you should be able to,
family guy can do whatever the fuck they

1899
01:23:41,201 --> 01:23:42,220
want on Jesus.
Right?

1900
01:23:42,221 --> 01:23:43,140
Every episode,
there's a,

1901
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:48,300
you know,
there's an episode where Jesus is 

1902
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:50,070
bathing with porn music in the 
background in front of [inaudible] a 

1903
01:23:50,070 --> 01:23:50,070
baby.
Nobody had a problem with that.

1904
01:23:50,070 --> 01:23:51,130
Try doing that with Mohammed.
But we can't have,

1905
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:53,590
we can't just pick,
you can pick,

1906
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:55,990
say whatever the fuck you want about 
Judaism.

1907
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:58,540
Big Goddamn deal.
What is it with Cenk?

1908
01:23:58,630 --> 01:23:59,470
What I mean,
you,

1909
01:23:59,471 --> 01:24:00,130
you know,
um,

1910
01:24:00,131 --> 01:24:00,550
I,
that,

1911
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:05,580
that was really perplexing to me because
I usually feel like you were there are 

1912
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:06,940
agree with him or don't agree with him 
on other things.

1913
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:08,080
I feel like he's,
you know,

1914
01:24:08,081 --> 01:24:10,030
he's got an opinion,
he thinks about it,

1915
01:24:10,031 --> 01:24:12,850
he talks about it,
he tries to be open minded,

1916
01:24:12,851 --> 01:24:17,851
he's passionate about these ideas,
but with that it was so confusing to me 

1917
01:24:17,851 --> 01:24:19,390
because it was almost like he was just 
trying to win,

1918
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:24,250
look like he was trying to find a way to
beat someone who is,

1919
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:27,230
you know,
Samson intellectual black belt,

1920
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:31,960
like a high level world champion black 
belts of the spoken word.

1921
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:37,320
And I think that Jank it's not at the 
same level of Sam when they come when it

1922
01:24:37,691 --> 01:24:42,691
comes to debating these ideas at one 
point about 20 minutes in Sam does lays 

1923
01:24:42,691 --> 01:24:47,341
out some basic probability stuff and 
yanked your says he doesn't believe in 

1924
01:24:47,341 --> 01:24:47,341
it.

1925
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:50,110
I mean that,
that sort of explains it right there.

1926
01:24:50,111 --> 01:24:55,111
Like Sam wasn't laying out a plan.
He was just saying this is sorta how 

1927
01:24:55,111 --> 01:24:55,111
probability works.
And Jack was like,

1928
01:24:55,111 --> 01:24:55,111
no,
no,

1929
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:55,900
no,
no,

1930
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:56,920
I don't.
I don't believe in it.

1931
01:24:57,580 --> 01:24:59,260
I don't know.
And just for the record,

1932
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:03,460
I get no pleasure even talking about 
this because you know,

1933
01:25:03,461 --> 01:25:04,450
you know,
you know what it's like.

1934
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:07,960
Did you debate Cenk or having a 
conversation with him off the air?

1935
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:10,570
No,
we didn't because it just,

1936
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,610
it just never materialized,
you know what I mean?

1937
01:25:12,611 --> 01:25:17,611
A lot of times when,
although I did do the main young Turk 

1938
01:25:17,611 --> 01:25:17,611
show with him a lot,
most of the time because I was on it,

1939
01:25:17,611 --> 01:25:22,541
it was because he was out of town,
so I was either filling in or something 

1940
01:25:22,541 --> 01:25:25,171
like that.
So there wasn't really the forum for 

1941
01:25:25,171 --> 01:25:25,171
that.
Um,

1942
01:25:25,171 --> 01:25:28,540
and then it really had a lot to do with 
why I left because I just could not 

1943
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,190
believe it that,
I mean there's,

1944
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:35,320
there's people that have edited things 
where Jake says one thing directly to 

1945
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:39,380
Sam's face and then days later is saying
the complete reverse thing.

1946
01:25:39,381 --> 01:25:41,230
Sitting down with Reza Aslan and saying 
that,

1947
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,150
yeah,
he means all Muslims.

1948
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:44,680
And it's like,
ugh.

1949
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:47,620
You just said to his face,
you just said to his face that,

1950
01:25:47,621 --> 01:25:50,560
you know,
that's not what he says and I think it's

1951
01:25:50,561 --> 01:25:55,561
partly,
it goes to that AFLAC thing that he's 

1952
01:25:55,561 --> 01:25:57,070
trying to be this,
he's trying to defend Muslim people that

1953
01:25:57,071 --> 01:26:02,071
he feels are being abused and,
and there's a lofty goal there 

1954
01:26:02,071 --> 01:26:04,610
somewhere,
but if you use the tactics of dishonesty

1955
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:07,010
and slander and smearing and all that to
get there,

1956
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:09,680
you,
it's not good.

1957
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:11,840
It's not good.
So I don't know.

1958
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:13,680
It's awful.
But I really liked him.

1959
01:26:13,681 --> 01:26:15,080
That's what fucks me up.
I,

1960
01:26:15,081 --> 01:26:18,640
I feel completely the same way and 
actually I am.

1961
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:21,920
So when I left I just left the thing be 
and I was like,

1962
01:26:21,921 --> 01:26:22,460
all right,
that's it.

1963
01:26:22,461 --> 01:26:23,060
You know,
I left,

1964
01:26:23,061 --> 01:26:25,070
we left on good terms,
we went out to breakfast,

1965
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:28,520
we were good to go,
and then he just kept on twitter,

1966
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:33,550
kept lying about it,
misrepresenting ideas and people and 

1967
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:34,340
tons of his own fans were turning on 
him.

1968
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:36,590
So I just finally,
after months I was like,

1969
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:38,480
I can't take this anymore.
I've got to do something.

1970
01:26:38,481 --> 01:26:43,481
And I didn't know.
I didn't know what to do because you 

1971
01:26:43,481 --> 01:26:43,481
know,
it's like,

1972
01:26:43,481 --> 01:26:43,481
it's like here's a friend,
here's a coworker,

1973
01:26:43,481 --> 01:26:48,401
a contemporary,
like how do I do this in a respectful 

1974
01:26:48,401 --> 01:26:48,401
way?

1975
01:26:48,401 --> 01:26:50,090
And finally one night I laid out like 
eight or 10 tweets in a row.

1976
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:51,980
I thought them all through first and I 
was like,

1977
01:26:51,981 --> 01:26:56,981
Jack,
here's what I think is going on because 

1978
01:26:56,981 --> 01:26:56,981
I needed it to be public because if I 
had just sent them an email,

1979
01:26:56,981 --> 01:26:57,380
I've,
you know,

1980
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:02,500
he could either not respond to respond,
but what does that do at the end of the 

1981
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:02,660
day if me and him get to our mayor 
Kulpa,

1982
01:27:02,661 --> 01:27:04,010
but it's not public,
right?

1983
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:06,460
So in a very respectful and not 
attacking me,

1984
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:09,530
I laid out some stuff.
He completely ignored it.

1985
01:27:09,690 --> 01:27:14,690
A couple of weeks went by,
finally I did something and finally he 

1986
01:27:14,690 --> 01:27:17,120
responded,
but then just kept doing the same shit.

1987
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:19,370
So I don't know what the answer is but 
I.

1988
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,680
But this is what Glenn is done.
This is what Rez is done.

1989
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:23,570
I don't get it.
I looked.

1990
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:27,470
These are tactics,
these are tactics they're using to win.

1991
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:30,440
Marginalized was right on my show who 
cowrote sandblast book,

1992
01:27:30,441 --> 01:27:35,441
it was a discussion about Islam called 
the future of tolerance Islam in the 

1993
01:27:35,441 --> 01:27:38,621
future of tolerance.
So I'm pretty sure these are people on 

1994
01:27:38,621 --> 01:27:38,621
the side of tolerance,
right?

1995
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:43,630
Majid,
who by the way has been treated worse 

1996
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:43,630
than anybody,
you know,

1997
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:43,660
like one of these guys that works at,
at,

1998
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:48,760
uh,
the intercept for Glen called a Mojito 

1999
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:49,280
porch monkey while he was sitting next 
to Sam.

2000
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:50,540
You know what I mean?
Like,

2001
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:51,230
because you,
oh,

2002
01:27:51,231 --> 01:27:56,231
you don't believe what we think you're 
supposed to believe as a Muslim person 

2003
01:27:56,231 --> 01:27:57,800
and you're with an atheist,
you're his porch monkey.

2004
01:27:57,980 --> 01:27:59,630
I mean,
think if that came from the right,

2005
01:27:59,631 --> 01:28:04,631
how we would rightly react,
react to that or how these guys on the 

2006
01:28:04,631 --> 01:28:05,150
left you would react to that.
Um,

2007
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:06,090
so anyway,
so,

2008
01:28:06,230 --> 01:28:08,300
so sadly,
and that's what leaves me with such like

2009
01:28:08,301 --> 01:28:12,050
conflict here is that I don't think it's
going to stop.

2010
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:14,750
And I,
and I think they've learned,

2011
01:28:14,830 --> 01:28:16,340
you know what?
What's that Hitler quote?

2012
01:28:16,341 --> 01:28:17,180
Like,
the bigger the lie,

2013
01:28:17,181 --> 01:28:22,181
the more people will believe it.
I think they're partly operating on 

2014
01:28:22,181 --> 01:28:22,700
that,
that the opportunity cost for Sam,

2015
01:28:22,701 --> 01:28:23,600
for you,
for me,

2016
01:28:23,601 --> 01:28:28,601
for anyone that cares about any of this,
to clean up the mess is is way too much 

2017
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:33,320
for just up Sam's racist.
That's the one that's easy,

2018
01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:38,410
but now same to clean it up and it's.
And it's a two hour frustrated 

2019
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:38,690
conversation that he had and yeah,
as you said,

2020
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,480
if you listen to it fucking brilliant,
brilliant.

2021
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:46,560
It was a two hour conversation that is 
trying to balance out x amount of months

2022
01:28:47,171 --> 01:28:52,171
of disinformation,
but I think that ultimately in the long 

2023
01:28:52,171 --> 01:28:55,501
run his ideas are more accurate.
They're more like what he's saying is 

2024
01:28:56,351 --> 01:29:00,700
well thought through and his opinions 
are better considered.

2025
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:01,760
I when you

2026
01:29:03,190 --> 01:29:06,510
cannot,
cannot made it through one with you.

2027
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:07,500
What with me?
Sure.

2028
01:29:07,501 --> 01:29:10,050
And it wasn't at one and it looked at 
one to the point that I,

2029
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:15,080
as I said before,
I think there's a tipping point coming 

2030
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:15,090
because I do think our site is getting 
stronger.

2031
01:29:15,091 --> 01:29:20,091
I really do.
But the amount of effort and energy he 

2032
01:29:20,091 --> 01:29:22,800
has had to put into this and when you 
see.

2033
01:29:22,801 --> 01:29:24,710
I think it's.
There's a chilling effect when they,

2034
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:26,490
when people see the ad,
I'm not talking about us.

2035
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:30,600
When the average person sees what has 
happened to this guy again,

2036
01:29:30,601 --> 01:29:32,520
you've sat with him for probably 20 
hours,

2037
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:37,670
never thought he was a racist before.
When the average person sees what 

2038
01:29:37,670 --> 01:29:39,030
they've done to him,
it causes the average person not to want

2039
01:29:39,031 --> 01:29:41,280
to speak about something.
I get emails.

2040
01:29:41,281 --> 01:29:43,530
I'm sure you get them.
I got an email a couple of days ago from

2041
01:29:43,531 --> 01:29:46,680
someone in Sweden saying,
I am terrified to talk about any of this

2042
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:46,890
stuff.

2043
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:50,010
I'm terrified to talk about what's 
happening in my country right now.

2044
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:51,740
You know,
and,

2045
01:29:51,830 --> 01:29:56,830
and I'm getting emails from all over 
literally all way from Saudi Arabia and 

2046
01:29:56,830 --> 01:29:56,880
all over the place.
People saying you're talking about stuff

2047
01:29:56,881 --> 01:30:01,881
that people are afraid to talk about.
I'm not doing it for any other reason 

2048
01:30:01,881 --> 01:30:01,881
other than I feel like I have to.
It's not.

2049
01:30:01,881 --> 01:30:06,861
You know what I mean?
Like I feel like I'm on this road 

2050
01:30:06,861 --> 01:30:06,861
because it,
it just appeared before me.

2051
01:30:06,861 --> 01:30:07,620
If this wasn't where I really wanted to 
go,

2052
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:11,970
my standard was a lot about transformers
and gi Joe.

2053
01:30:12,570 --> 01:30:14,760
Stupid Shit,
right?

2054
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:17,170
I don't know.
Yeah.

2055
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:18,750
I don't know either.
I don't know either,

2056
01:30:18,751 --> 01:30:23,751
but I think that when guys like Jank do 
say things that are easily discredited.

2057
01:30:24,361 --> 01:30:25,830
When you say like,
look,

2058
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:29,130
you said this one thing two days ago 
when you were talking to Sam,

2059
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:31,770
now you're saying something completely 
different when he's not here.

2060
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:37,250
That is so bad for people's perception 
of your ideas.

2061
01:30:37,410 --> 01:30:42,410
It's so bad for your own credibility.
It's so bad when you express opinions 

2062
01:30:42,781 --> 01:30:46,110
about other things,
like you can say something like,

2063
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:50,520
as a comic you can say things and you 
can joke around them and I can know that

2064
01:30:50,521 --> 01:30:52,620
you're joking so I can I.
okay.

2065
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:55,470
He doesn't really believe that and 
you're fucking around,

2066
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:58,200
but that's this.
This isn't fucking around.

2067
01:30:58,350 --> 01:31:01,290
So you're being held to your ideas,
your ideas.

2068
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:06,500
You're held accountable for your ideas 
and when your ideas are massively 

2069
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:09,921
inconsistent and contrary days later and
when you are expressing an idea that you

2070
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:16,550
have to know is incorrect.
So that's the part that I don't 

2071
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:17,400
understand because look,
I have fucked up,

2072
01:31:17,610 --> 01:31:19,290
we've all done fucked up things in our 
life.

2073
01:31:19,291 --> 01:31:21,510
We've all,
we've all lied,

2074
01:31:21,511 --> 01:31:22,890
we've all,
whatever I have.

2075
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:25,140
Maybe you bro,
not you,

2076
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:25,530
not you.

2077
01:31:25,530 --> 01:31:26,900
I know.
We've,

2078
01:31:26,910 --> 01:31:29,000
we've asked yourself,
we've all made mistakes.

2079
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:30,390
You know,
look,

2080
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,770
Brian Williams made some stupid part ego
mistake,

2081
01:31:34,771 --> 01:31:36,060
part,
whatever you want to call it.

2082
01:31:36,110 --> 01:31:41,110
A and then only found like 15 different 
but everything being equal,

2083
01:31:41,161 --> 01:31:45,930
they weren't like cataclysmic lies in 
the scheme of what,

2084
01:31:45,931 --> 01:31:50,931
uh,
you know what I mean in the scheme of 

2085
01:31:50,931 --> 01:31:52,041
things,
they were about his little adventures 

2086
01:31:52,041 --> 01:31:52,290
that he exaggerated partly because of 
the media because the media wants you to

2087
01:31:52,291 --> 01:31:57,291
be a star two.
So he has to go on the tonight show and 

2088
01:31:57,291 --> 01:31:57,291
talk about being on a helicopter.
Went actually,

2089
01:31:57,291 --> 01:31:58,980
would Walter Cronkite have done that?
Probably.

2090
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:00,050
I don't know.

2091
01:32:00,970 --> 01:32:03,640
I've got a friend,
Steve Reynolds easy and I think,

2092
01:32:03,641 --> 01:32:04,480
you know,
his story,

2093
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:06,320
the nine slash 11 story.
Um,

2094
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:08,100
and I,
I think they're really similar.

2095
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:11,710
The Brian Williams thing and that like 
both original stories.

2096
01:32:11,711 --> 01:32:16,711
We're actually pretty impressive and 
these guys doctored them up and turned 

2097
01:32:16,711 --> 01:32:20,541
them into this epic thing that 
ultimately cost them a shitload of 

2098
01:32:20,541 --> 01:32:25,261
credibility,
if not all their credibility with Brian 

2099
01:32:25,261 --> 01:32:28,110
Williams.
He was actually in a fucking helicopter 

2100
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:28,110
in Iraq.
The helicopter in front of them was shot

2101
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:28,750
at.
So like,

2102
01:32:28,751 --> 01:32:30,880
that's scary as fuck.
You're a reporter,

2103
01:32:31,090 --> 01:32:34,060
you're getting shot at you,
you're hearing gunshots.

2104
01:32:34,061 --> 01:32:35,740
Go off the people in front of you or a 
hit.

2105
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:41,070
That's a good story.
Your helicopter had to get hit though 

2106
01:32:41,070 --> 01:32:44,791
because ultimately these people are full
of shit and they have to exaggerate and,

2107
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:46,720
and,
and jazz it up.

2108
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:48,760
They don't.
And because of that,

2109
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:51,160
you can't trust what they're saying.

2110
01:32:51,180 --> 01:32:51,900
Right.
So then that,

2111
01:32:51,901 --> 01:32:54,870
then it has that effect where you go at 
this guy did this one.

2112
01:32:54,871 --> 01:32:56,050
Exactly,
but think about it.

2113
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,790
Actually my point was actually the 
reverse of that because what I was going

2114
01:32:58,791 --> 01:33:03,430
to say is that his,
his lies were little additional details,

2115
01:33:03,431 --> 01:33:04,060
you know,
like a little.

2116
01:33:04,061 --> 01:33:09,061
I'm a little cooler details what these 
guys have done have been too blatantly 

2117
01:33:09,370 --> 01:33:10,230
distort.
Yeah.

2118
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,910
Someone's views.
So we talked to you about opponent.

2119
01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:14,500
That's the difference,
right?

2120
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:16,660
Because it's a competition between 
Jenkins,

2121
01:33:16,661 --> 01:33:17,350
Sam.
Right.

2122
01:33:17,351 --> 01:33:18,640
So,
so what do you do with that?

2123
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:21,040
So what do I can't?
Well,

2124
01:33:21,041 --> 01:33:26,041
I,
I like junk but I'm not turning to him 

2125
01:33:26,041 --> 01:33:26,041
for advice or ideas.
Now I can't.

2126
01:33:26,041 --> 01:33:30,871
I mean that's how I listened to his.
When I listened to his opinions about 

2127
01:33:30,871 --> 01:33:33,961
things I unfortunately have to take into
consideration that has been massively 

2128
01:33:33,961 --> 01:33:34,900
inconsistent about this one thing.

2129
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:38,170
So when,
when someone is caught or exposure,

2130
01:33:38,171 --> 01:33:43,171
whatever you want to call it,
to have so severely misrepresented 

2131
01:33:43,171 --> 01:33:46,351
someone else's views,
how were you able to separate that from 

2132
01:33:46,351 --> 01:33:46,351
the other,
the rest?

2133
01:33:46,351 --> 01:33:49,921
So let's say you like 80 percent of his 
views or anybody would have to make it 

2134
01:33:49,921 --> 01:33:49,921
about him.
How,

2135
01:33:49,921 --> 01:33:51,250
how do you separate that out?
Because I,

2136
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:56,251
at this point,
I don't know how I do it at all and I 

2137
01:33:56,251 --> 01:33:56,740
know Sam has said that about Glen.
Even when it comes to the,

2138
01:33:56,741 --> 01:33:58,180
uh,
the NSA stuff,

2139
01:33:58,990 --> 01:34:03,990
he's like,
I don't know what to make of that now 

2140
01:34:03,990 --> 01:34:03,990
because I know what this person is 
capable of.

2141
01:34:03,990 --> 01:34:04,900
I think that's a really interesting 
point.

2142
01:34:04,901 --> 01:34:09,901
It's a very interesting point and it's a
very important point because I have 

2143
01:34:09,901 --> 01:34:13,051
people on this podcast all the time that
I don't agree with and I want to hear 

2144
01:34:13,051 --> 01:34:13,051
their thoughts.

2145
01:34:13,051 --> 01:34:17,250
I want to know why.
I had this conversation with Mark Marin 

2146
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:17,250
the other night at the comedy store and 
he was like,

2147
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:18,610
why'd you have that guy on?
You know that guys have this,

2148
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:21,040
and then he said that because I want to 
find out what makes them tick.

2149
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:23,830
I want to find out what goes on his head
that goes on in his head,

2150
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:28,980
but there's a difference between someone
I don't agree with and someone who I 

2151
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:31,450
know is distorting that use of another 
person,

2152
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:36,660
like changing someone's words,
changing someone's intent and and doing 

2153
01:34:36,821 --> 01:34:41,821
it for their own benefit,
doing it so that they can win this 

2154
01:34:41,821 --> 01:34:44,671
ideological conversation,
this argument that that becomes a real 

2155
01:34:44,671 --> 01:34:45,380
issue and there also becomes a real 
issue.

2156
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:50,400
Like what if I having a conversation 
with you and then two weeks later you 

2157
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:50,710
distort what I say?
Exactly.

2158
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:51,820
I don't want to do that.

2159
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:56,820
I don't.
I don't want to have to defend my ideas 

2160
01:34:56,820 --> 01:34:57,020
because you've mislabeled them or ms.ms
dot,

2161
01:34:57,110 --> 01:34:58,520
you know,
misconstrued.

2162
01:34:58,580 --> 01:34:59,180
You know,
it's funny.

2163
01:34:59,230 --> 01:35:04,230
It's also what is so cool about being in
the digital space because as I said,

2164
01:35:04,491 --> 01:35:06,530
people are first off,
people are clipping things.

2165
01:35:06,531 --> 01:35:08,270
You can clip on twitter,
here's what you did,

2166
01:35:08,271 --> 01:35:09,710
here's what you did and they can explain
to them,

2167
01:35:09,890 --> 01:35:14,890
so first off you've empowered the people
at the bottom of this that are just 

2168
01:35:14,890 --> 01:35:16,700
consuming it are now able to get their 
voices heard,

2169
01:35:16,701 --> 01:35:21,701
to fight the bullshit and I think that 
there has been a real wave with that 

2170
01:35:21,701 --> 01:35:25,181
which is incredibly inspiring to me.
It's so different than ever before and 

2171
01:35:25,181 --> 01:35:25,640
look,
see if someone came on here.

2172
01:35:25,641 --> 01:35:30,641
If I come on here and I said something 
that was profoundly dishonest or was 

2173
01:35:30,641 --> 01:35:32,050
smearing of someone else,
I would never hear the end of it and and

2174
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:37,060
hopefully people would tag you on 
twitter and you retweet the shit out of 

2175
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:37,340
it until everybody had seen.

2176
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:39,890
You see what fucking Rubin did and 
whatever.

2177
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:41,870
Now I'm pretty sure that's not going to 
have not the end of this,

2178
01:35:41,871 --> 01:35:43,400
but when you don't,
it doesn't benefit.

2179
01:35:43,401 --> 01:35:45,470
You know,
it doesn't benefit because you can be.

2180
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,540
That's what I don't understand about 
these guys.

2181
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:50,480
How can you do this?
How can you retweet memes?

2182
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:54,260
Implying that Sam wants to a nuclear 
entire Middle East.

2183
01:35:54,261 --> 01:35:59,261
When you first of all,
you know his whole thing on nuking the 

2184
01:35:59,261 --> 01:35:59,720
first right thing.
It's at the end of end of faith.

2185
01:35:59,870 --> 01:36:04,870
It's about a page and a half.
That's how much time he spent on this 

2186
01:36:04,870 --> 01:36:09,431
topic and they've made it sound like 
this is his bucket and go to his 

2187
01:36:09,431 --> 01:36:12,581
position and he's.
He's talking about a horrific scenario 

2188
01:36:12,650 --> 01:36:17,300
or some isis type civilization has 
control of nuclear weapons and there's a

2189
01:36:17,301 --> 01:36:19,670
real threat that they're going to use 
them on other people.

2190
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:20,660
That's what he's talking about.

2191
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:22,970
Apocalyptic regime.
You asked what he's talking.

2192
01:36:22,971 --> 01:36:26,070
You have to consider that.
If that's possibility,

2193
01:36:26,170 --> 01:36:31,170
if it's a possibility that there could 
be a regime like that somewhere in the 

2194
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:31,170
world,
you have to say,

2195
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:31,250
well,
what would we do?

2196
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:36,430
What are the options?
What could you do in that scenario to 

2197
01:36:36,430 --> 01:36:39,560
not debate that is to like dig your head
in the sand and that's.

2198
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:42,200
That's the bigger problem.
What do you think Barack Obama thinks on

2199
01:36:42,201 --> 01:36:43,370
this?
We have nukes right now.

2200
01:36:43,610 --> 01:36:46,010
We know we have new because we're the 
only country that's used nukes.

2201
01:36:46,220 --> 01:36:51,220
Do you think that Barack Obama would 
only wait until we were nuked to use 

2202
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:52,190
nukes?
Probably not.

2203
01:36:52,191 --> 01:36:53,810
Right?
I don't know.

2204
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:57,050
I mean I couldn't,
no matter how much discussion there.

2205
01:36:57,170 --> 01:37:02,170
Yeah,
there's a discussion there and I think 

2206
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:02,170
that's the.
That's the deal.

2207
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:05,111
It's like a discussion.
I think when you discredit people would 

2208
01:37:05,111 --> 01:37:06,530
be dishonest statements.

2209
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:08,690
When you say things that you know are 
not true,

2210
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:14,810
it becomes a huge issue.
Not not like what you're talking about.

2211
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:16,190
When you said,
well,

2212
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:20,540
I'm pretty sure no one's gonna find 
contradictory statements by me.

2213
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:23,240
Well,
it's because there's no benefit in it.

2214
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:28,360
Yeah.
Like you like is not going to really 

2215
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:29,630
gain points by distorting Sam's 
perspectives on things.

2216
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:34,840
He is only going to gain points with 
people who don't actually know Sam's 

2217
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:37,340
perspective.
He's going to lose massively when people

2218
01:37:37,341 --> 01:37:39,570
do listen to what Sam says.
Yeah,

2219
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:44,710
because then you all of a sudden,
whatever goodwill and whatever,

2220
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:50,080
love and appreciation for your ideas,
that's going to go out the window when 

2221
01:37:51,741 --> 01:37:53,870
they find out that your ideas have been 
distorted,

2222
01:37:54,050 --> 01:37:56,670
that your your points of view rather of 
other people's ideas.

2223
01:37:56,671 --> 01:37:57,780
I've been distorted.
Yeah.

2224
01:37:57,781 --> 01:38:02,160
I've had that happen to me on this show.
I show with a guy that I actually like.

2225
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:07,310
Even though he did this sky,
Jamie Kilstein and ancillary.

2226
01:38:07,551 --> 01:38:09,640
We did.
He's a social justice warrior.

2227
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:11,640
The whole deal.
I don't think he's a bad guy.

2228
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:13,410
I really don't.
I like them as human being.

2229
01:38:13,690 --> 01:38:14,610
I,
every time I talked to him,

2230
01:38:14,611 --> 01:38:17,550
I enjoy talking to them,
but we did a podcast to get together and

2231
01:38:17,551 --> 01:38:22,551
we disagreed on a bunch of things.
Then when he went on his podcast and 

2232
01:38:22,551 --> 01:38:25,950
completely distorted everything that I 
said and changed the entire conversation

2233
01:38:25,951 --> 01:38:27,690
to him being a victim,
which is,

2234
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:28,740
which is one.
Oh,

2235
01:38:28,810 --> 01:38:29,580
one one.
Oh,

2236
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,000
and then this guy online put together 
the actual conversation and Jamie's 

2237
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,680
perception of the conversation and it 
said it was,

2238
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:42,860
I forget the Kilstein delusion.
It was the name of the video and because

2239
01:38:43,321 --> 01:38:48,321
of that he received so much fucking hate
and I think that made him aware of that 

2240
01:38:48,321 --> 01:38:52,881
and he said it was the low moment of his
life and he completely good stop doing 

2241
01:38:52,881 --> 01:38:54,860
that and he doesn't do any of that shit 
anymore and you know,

2242
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:57,480
he's rebounded and now he's happier than
he's ever been before.

2243
01:38:57,630 --> 01:39:01,060
But I think that that type of behavior 
is not to standard.

2244
01:39:01,370 --> 01:39:04,080
It's accepted.
It's almost expected,

2245
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:09,400
you know,
it's like what they do and that's if 

2246
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:09,720
you're a part of that victim culture,
the perpetual victim culture,

2247
01:39:09,870 --> 01:39:11,150
that's how you do it,
you,

2248
01:39:11,151 --> 01:39:16,151
you,
you make it seem like people were 

2249
01:39:16,151 --> 01:39:16,800
yelling at you and there's people and 
they were so upset with me and all I was

2250
01:39:16,801 --> 01:39:18,120
doing was trying to say that women 
shouldn't be raped.

2251
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:20,160
That's not what happened.
Not what happened.

2252
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:22,890
That must've been incredibly validating 
for you.

2253
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,310
Right?
Like because it,

2254
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:29,380
because it's personal too,
and that that's why you can see my body 

2255
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:30,440
language probably when I talk about Jake
doesn't,

2256
01:39:30,910 --> 01:39:34,020
I get no pleasure out of this.
This is not how I see.

2257
01:39:34,070 --> 01:39:37,350
I didn't go to work for this guy and 
agree with so much of,

2258
01:39:37,530 --> 01:39:38,880
you know,
get money out of politics.

2259
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:39,330
You know,
his,

2260
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:44,360
his core stuff.
I didn't go there for my feelings 

2261
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:46,140
ultimately to be this,
but that's where we're at.

2262
01:39:46,141 --> 01:39:47,940
So in a case like you're talking about 
with Jamie,

2263
01:39:48,090 --> 01:39:51,630
it's extremely validating that you 
create a space based on a certain amount

2264
01:39:51,631 --> 01:39:53,760
of principles.
Someone goes against them,

2265
01:39:53,761 --> 01:39:58,761
your audience then calls them out and 
then there's like a teachable moment to 

2266
01:39:58,761 --> 01:39:58,761
him.
It's pretty good,

2267
01:39:58,761 --> 01:40:00,690
pretty great.
I think in that way it's great.

2268
01:40:00,691 --> 01:40:05,691
I don't,
I didn't take any pleasure in the fact 

2269
01:40:05,691 --> 01:40:08,271
that he got fucked up emotionally 
because of it or not that the hate that 

2270
01:40:08,701 --> 01:40:13,701
you get online,
especially if you're like a super 

2271
01:40:13,701 --> 01:40:13,860
sensitive person that's really trolling 
for love.

2272
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:17,880
You know all your fucking lines in the 
water and you're trolling for love.

2273
01:40:17,881 --> 01:40:19,800
That's what you're doing.
And in saying that,

2274
01:40:19,801 --> 01:40:22,200
and even becoming this victim,
you're trolling for love.

2275
01:40:22,530 --> 01:40:22,830
I mean,
it's,

2276
01:40:22,831 --> 01:40:25,290
you're trying to do,
trying to get people to fuck Joe Rogan.

2277
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:26,670
Fuck that.
Transphobic,

2278
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:28,290
homophobic,
racist,

2279
01:40:28,350 --> 01:40:30,150
sexist,
misogynistic,

2280
01:40:30,151 --> 01:40:32,020
asshole.
Like throw them all out there,

2281
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:33,840
throw them all out there.
I mean,

2282
01:40:33,841 --> 01:40:36,560
but that's what's what,
what's going on when someone's.

2283
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:41,630
And you got to realize that when you 
distort people's perceptions or distort 

2284
01:40:41,941 --> 01:40:44,730
people's positions for your own personal
benefit,

2285
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:49,880
you do yourself a horrible disservice 
because you now have ruined any 

2286
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:51,770
validity,
any,

2287
01:40:51,771 --> 01:40:56,771
any,
anything that you have in the past that 

2288
01:40:56,771 --> 01:40:58,741
may resonate with people.
You've ruined that because now you've 

2289
01:40:58,741 --> 01:40:58,741
poisoned that well.

2290
01:40:58,741 --> 01:41:03,000
Yeah.
So it can be so laid out clearly like 

2291
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,281
this.
Let's say that two of the five things 

2292
01:41:05,281 --> 01:41:05,281
that Sam,
you know,

2293
01:41:05,281 --> 01:41:06,610
those controversial things.
So the profiling thing,

2294
01:41:06,611 --> 01:41:08,080
right?
Um,

2295
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:12,520
or we belaboring this point because I 
think it's so there's so much to it.

2296
01:41:12,521 --> 01:41:12,970
Yeah.
Okay.

2297
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:18,360
Um,
but let's say Sam would argue that 

2298
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:20,410
because these are debatable ideas,
we should debate them.

2299
01:41:20,590 --> 01:41:23,300
So imagine if subsequently so they do 
the three hours,

2300
01:41:23,301 --> 01:41:28,301
sit down,
he and Jane and after that instead of 

2301
01:41:28,301 --> 01:41:28,301
saying he wants to profile Muslim Ba,
Ba and Ba,

2302
01:41:28,301 --> 01:41:30,580
ba Ba and all that bravado and bullshit 
and whatever.

2303
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:31,810
I imagine if he had said,
you know,

2304
01:41:31,811 --> 01:41:36,811
Sam and I really disagree on this,
I fear that Sam's use of anti profiling,

2305
01:41:38,321 --> 01:41:39,820
we're profiling whatever you want to 
call it.

2306
01:41:39,850 --> 01:41:44,800
I fear that ultimately it will lead if 
you know for,

2307
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:48,500
for good and you know the road to hell 
is paved with good intentions.

2308
01:41:48,730 --> 01:41:50,500
I think that he's trying to do something
good,

2309
01:41:50,501 --> 01:41:55,030
but ultimately it's going to lead to 
Muslim people feeling persecuted,

2310
01:41:55,031 --> 01:42:00,031
feeling like the other.
But if he had laid that out like that 

2311
01:42:00,031 --> 01:42:03,990
and had an intellectually honest say,
we believe different things here and 

2312
01:42:03,990 --> 01:42:07,300
that's okay.
You have a pretty great place to be.

2313
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,280
Yes,
you have a pretty fucking great place to

2314
01:42:09,281 --> 01:42:14,281
be.
People who who prayer pretty much agree 

2315
01:42:14,281 --> 01:42:14,320
on most things and that we can move 
forward and go,

2316
01:42:14,321 --> 01:42:16,960
we disagree.
But when you do what he did,

2317
01:42:16,961 --> 01:42:17,880
you've,
you've just,

2318
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:23,320
you've ransacked the playing field and 
now and now you just have burned 

2319
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:28,291
bullshit and that's what it's become.
So that's why when you mentioned Kyle's 

2320
01:42:28,291 --> 01:42:29,380
podcast,
that's why Sam,

2321
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:31,200
that's as frustrated as I've ever heard 
him,

2322
01:42:31,210 --> 01:42:36,210
but as you said,
it was still pretty eloquent and pretty 

2323
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:36,210
elegant,
but he's pissed.

2324
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:37,630
He's pissed and I think rightly so.
And that's why,

2325
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:40,960
that's why I've been so defensive over 
the guy because I know it's like,

2326
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:43,540
let's have this,
if we can do this now.

2327
01:42:43,541 --> 01:42:44,620
It's only gonna get worse.

2328
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:49,780
I have as well.
I mean I've been very defensive with 

2329
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:49,780
them as well and unfortunately I have a 
good friend,

2330
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:53,500
Abby Martin that I love dearly as well,
but she and Sam have gone back and forth

2331
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:59,030
about this and I think she in some ways 
distorts his perceptions.

2332
01:42:59,090 --> 01:42:59,860
I mean,
I've seen,

2333
01:42:59,930 --> 01:43:02,090
I've seen her story.
I don't know her that well,

2334
01:43:02,091 --> 01:43:03,860
so I don't want to.
I love her.

2335
01:43:03,861 --> 01:43:04,950
She's awesome.
I've seen her,

2336
01:43:04,951 --> 01:43:07,060
the stored a lot of facts on air to talk
about,

2337
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:12,100
about different things.
She gets very passionate and I think 

2338
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:12,100
sometimes she misses the mark on certain
things,

2339
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:15,560
but she's a very good person and I think
she's ultimately,

2340
01:43:15,590 --> 01:43:20,590
she has all the right intentions,
but the intention is to have the pay the

2341
01:43:21,171 --> 01:43:23,570
road to hell,
those fucking things.

2342
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:25,940
You see what I'm saying?
That yes it is.

2343
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:30,740
It's like with a guy like Genco,
I think he's his own worst enemy in that

2344
01:43:30,741 --> 01:43:33,800
regard because once you start doing 
that,

2345
01:43:33,801 --> 01:43:38,801
then you have to sort of double down 
just to try to figure out a more 

2346
01:43:38,801 --> 01:43:40,940
eloquent way of reestablishing your 
position and when you do that,

2347
01:43:40,970 --> 01:43:42,590
like people don't take you seriously 
anymore.

2348
01:43:42,770 --> 01:43:44,180
That's the problem.
That's a real problem.

2349
01:43:44,181 --> 01:43:45,080
You become your own enemy.

2350
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:50,240
Yeah.
You throw out that bomb of bullshit and 

2351
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:50,280
now you're not going to be.
There was a point,

2352
01:43:50,281 --> 01:43:52,070
there is time.
Look,

2353
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:55,630
if you said something that was 
completely untrue or,

2354
01:43:55,660 --> 01:43:57,290
or you smeared somebody,
right,

2355
01:43:57,470 --> 01:44:00,230
and then two weeks later you thought it 
through.

2356
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:02,210
Even if you.
Even if you knew you were lying when you

2357
01:44:02,211 --> 01:44:03,950
did it,
but two weeks later you're like,

2358
01:44:03,951 --> 01:44:05,330
wow,
I really shouldn't have done that.

2359
01:44:05,331 --> 01:44:07,820
Like I intended to do something good 
there.

2360
01:44:08,420 --> 01:44:13,040
You could backtrack with the value that 
you have in your name and your fans.

2361
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:14,660
They would follow you back.
Yeah.

2362
01:44:14,661 --> 01:44:15,960
A couple of people will be like,
fuck him,

2363
01:44:15,961 --> 01:44:20,961
but.
But people would go and if you calmly 

2364
01:44:20,961 --> 01:44:20,961
explained what happened,
you could.

2365
01:44:20,961 --> 01:44:24,850
The problem with these guys is they've 
gone and they kept going and kept going 

2366
01:44:24,850 --> 01:44:25,220
and kept going,
but they're so off the range now.

2367
01:44:25,430 --> 01:44:30,430
In my view,
there's nothing they could do to ever 

2368
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:30,430
fix this situation.
It's like a guy,

2369
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:32,270
I know where I'm going,
but you really don't,

2370
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:33,970
and then you just keep saying,
I know where you're going.

2371
01:44:33,980 --> 01:44:36,020
Your last further and further in the 
woods.

2372
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:36,620
Like,
dude,

2373
01:44:36,621 --> 01:44:41,621
you're so far from the fucking road.
Now you're going to have to shoot 

2374
01:44:41,621 --> 01:44:43,901
yourself and come back as a baby and 
lived your life again because this is a 

2375
01:44:43,901 --> 01:44:44,640
disaster we created.
Yeah.

2376
01:44:44,930 --> 01:44:45,670
Yeah.
I just.

2377
01:44:45,690 --> 01:44:46,640
I don't know.
I don't.

2378
01:44:46,641 --> 01:44:50,000
I don't know how to fix that,
but I know what it is when I see it.

2379
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:51,710
Yeah.
Well I think this is fixing it.

2380
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:56,860
I think this is fixing that.
That's actually when I woke up this 

2381
01:44:56,860 --> 01:44:56,860
morning and even when I went to bed last
night,

2382
01:44:56,860 --> 01:44:59,270
I was like in a great place because I 
was like,

2383
01:44:59,271 --> 01:45:02,090
I knew I wanted to have this 
conversation and I try.

2384
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:06,020
I've had it in little bites on my show,
but I don't like.

2385
01:45:06,770 --> 01:45:09,470
Not that this has really been about me 
because this is about some big stuff,

2386
01:45:09,650 --> 01:45:13,040
but we're having more of a of a lofty 
thing here.

2387
01:45:13,070 --> 01:45:17,810
Then it is about you in a way because 
you're a part of this big stuff and also

2388
01:45:17,811 --> 01:45:20,570
when you're doing your show like the 
Rubin report,

2389
01:45:20,870 --> 01:45:25,870
what you're doing is you're expressing 
yourself and you become a credible 

2390
01:45:27,171 --> 01:45:30,950
portal to these ideas and information.
So it is about you in a way because it's

2391
01:45:30,951 --> 01:45:35,951
about all of us and it's about your 
credibility as that portal and you,

2392
01:45:36,091 --> 01:45:38,150
you.
You have to defend that,

2393
01:45:38,340 --> 01:45:40,310
that that's fucking.
Look,

2394
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:43,310
I'm wrong about shit all the time,
but if I'm wrong about shit,

2395
01:45:43,550 --> 01:45:48,550
dude,
I'm the first person to tell you I'm 

2396
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:48,550
wrong about it because I'm horrified if 
I.

2397
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:51,740
unless it's some simple stupid mistake,
but when I'm.

2398
01:45:51,770 --> 01:45:53,900
When I'm making.
If I make a mistake,

2399
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:56,120
I want to be the first guy to talk about
it.

2400
01:45:56,300 --> 01:46:01,300
I don't,
I don't want anybody believing anything 

2401
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:01,300
that's not true to help my ego.

2402
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:03,380
So you've had a carer,
Santa Maria on her.

2403
01:46:03,650 --> 01:46:05,180
So she's,
she's a good friend of mine,

2404
01:46:05,181 --> 01:46:07,850
worked with me at tea lover and I am 
not.

2405
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:08,450
Yeah,
I love her too.

2406
01:46:08,451 --> 01:46:11,420
She's fantastic.
And she is a science communicator.

2407
01:46:11,710 --> 01:46:13,430
That's the way she describes herself.
Um,

2408
01:46:13,550 --> 01:46:18,550
I think she had something to do with 
this brain surgery life thing last 

2409
01:46:18,550 --> 01:46:18,550
night.
Yes.

2410
01:46:18,550 --> 01:46:21,391
I machio yes.
So she's doing really good stuff and I 

2411
01:46:21,391 --> 01:46:22,700
really respect her in Laker a many.
I've said to my audience many times,

2412
01:46:22,701 --> 01:46:24,020
you know,
I know a lot about politics,

2413
01:46:24,021 --> 01:46:24,980
garden beds,
all this stuff.

2414
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:26,540
I'm not a science guy,
like,

2415
01:46:27,020 --> 01:46:28,370
you know,
I can understand basic stuff,

2416
01:46:28,371 --> 01:46:33,371
but I'm not a scientist.
So I have to trust people that know 

2417
01:46:33,371 --> 01:46:36,551
about science to tell me things.
So many times I've brought her on just 

2418
01:46:36,551 --> 01:46:37,630
to clean up messes that I've made.
Sure.

2419
01:46:37,730 --> 01:46:40,370
So I never go with the,
uh,

2420
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:45,400
I never go with the presumption to my 
audience that I know everything about 

2421
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:45,400
everything.

2422
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:46,670
I'm going to bring on some people and 
look then.

2423
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:48,860
So when I've done things on GMO is with 
Cara,

2424
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:50,160
she,
she is,

2425
01:46:50,161 --> 01:46:52,560
uh,
she firmly believes in Gmos and that's a

2426
01:46:52,561 --> 01:46:53,760
whole,
that's a whole other thing,

2427
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:58,800
right?
But I know a lot of people don't like 

2428
01:46:58,800 --> 01:46:58,800
her stance on Gmos,
but I say,

2429
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:00,240
here's my science person,
here's what she said about this,

2430
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:05,420
and I'm actually trying to find someone 
that's a little more against GMO is now 

2431
01:47:05,420 --> 01:47:05,420
to come on and refute some of that 
stuff.

2432
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:09,240
We don't have as the interviewer,
as the guy on this side of it.

2433
01:47:09,241 --> 01:47:14,241
We don't have to know everything,
which is what you said before that that 

2434
01:47:14,241 --> 01:47:14,241
does give us a little bit of a leash,
right?

2435
01:47:14,241 --> 01:47:17,910
Because we're sitting across from 
someone and we're just bouncing ideas.

2436
01:47:17,930 --> 01:47:19,920
We're also talking about so many 
different subjects.

2437
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:22,520
It's impossible to be an expert in all 
of that.

2438
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:24,480
Yeah.
I guess this actually goes to your point

2439
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:28,470
about the format of realtime and all 
these shows that look at,

2440
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:31,080
look at where we bounced here already.
You know what I mean?

2441
01:47:31,081 --> 01:47:36,081
There's only a couple areas where I feel
real comfortable and saying I'm an 

2442
01:47:36,081 --> 01:47:37,740
expert,
I'm an expert in stand up comedy and I'm

2443
01:47:37,741 --> 01:47:40,620
an expert in martial arts and even in 
martial arts there's,

2444
01:47:40,710 --> 01:47:44,160
there's certain aspects of martial arts 
where I have to defer to other experts.

2445
01:47:44,190 --> 01:47:44,970
Yeah.
You know,

2446
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,280
there's just too many styles.
There's too many different.

2447
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:47,870
There's,
you know,

2448
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:51,450
there's some different weird Filipinos.
There's C lot,

2449
01:47:51,470 --> 01:47:55,740
there's different stick fighting styles 
and like you can't know everything.

2450
01:47:55,770 --> 01:47:56,640
You can't.
Well you can't,

2451
01:47:56,641 --> 01:48:01,641
not only can't know anything,
but if you want to see how the thing 

2452
01:48:01,641 --> 01:48:01,641
that you consider yourself an expert in 
how it,

2453
01:48:01,641 --> 01:48:06,560
how it all sort of leads to one road,
look what you did with men because you 

2454
01:48:07,801 --> 01:48:09,330
had a set of principles,
right?

2455
01:48:09,570 --> 01:48:12,270
You had a set of principles in something
that you love.

2456
01:48:12,271 --> 01:48:13,320
Stand up.
Right?

2457
01:48:13,321 --> 01:48:18,321
I mean,
is there anything you love more than 

2458
01:48:18,321 --> 01:48:18,321
stand up beside wife and kids?
Like,

2459
01:48:18,321 --> 01:48:18,321
is that it?
Yeah,

2460
01:48:18,321 --> 01:48:19,170
friend's wife,
kids health,

2461
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:22,440
but in terms of the other things like 
standards,

2462
01:48:22,441 --> 01:48:23,060
right?
Yeah.

2463
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:23,710
And,
and,

2464
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:28,730
and what you did with Mensa,
which I'm sure you've talked about a 

2465
01:48:28,730 --> 01:48:28,730
bajillion times already.
Uh,

2466
01:48:28,730 --> 01:48:30,600
do you remember we met one to actually 
know what did we meet?

2467
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:35,720
We met at the young Turks.
You were going to do an air show and we 

2468
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:40,191
were,
we were talking for a few minutes and 

2469
01:48:40,191 --> 01:48:40,191
obviously I knew who you were,
but I didn't want.

2470
01:48:40,191 --> 01:48:40,380
I'm a comic too,
like I just didn't.

2471
01:48:40,381 --> 01:48:45,381
So we just shot the shit for a few 
minutes and we talked about that a 

2472
01:48:45,381 --> 01:48:45,381
little bit,
but my point is that because you,

2473
01:48:45,381 --> 01:48:50,131
you used the set of principles that are 
guiding you right now to do this show 

2474
01:48:50,131 --> 01:48:52,140
are the same principles that you use to 
defend your art in,

2475
01:48:52,141 --> 01:48:53,490
in that moment,
you know,

2476
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:58,700
so all of these things,
they all come together one way or 

2477
01:48:58,700 --> 01:48:58,700
another.

2478
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:00,600
In some ways.
The real problem with that men,

2479
01:49:00,690 --> 01:49:04,980
a thing was that the art form is being 
compromised,

2480
01:49:04,981 --> 01:49:07,080
not just by him stealing from other 
people,

2481
01:49:07,081 --> 01:49:12,081
but him creating an environment where 
people are terrified to express 

2482
01:49:12,081 --> 01:49:12,081
themselves.
Like I mean,

2483
01:49:12,081 --> 01:49:13,770
look at that social justice warrior,
right?

2484
01:49:13,771 --> 01:49:16,680
That's the same thing that they've done 
by jake yelling racist.

2485
01:49:16,681 --> 01:49:18,120
Now what have you done?
Most sort of.

2486
01:49:18,121 --> 01:49:20,280
He was.
You couldn't express yourself because he

2487
01:49:20,281 --> 01:49:23,850
would steal those ideas and call them 
his own and that's why I think there was

2488
01:49:23,851 --> 01:49:28,851
literally like a signal that people 
would do where you'd be on stage for 

2489
01:49:28,851 --> 01:49:32,751
five minutes.
He had a 15 minute set and all of a 

2490
01:49:32,751 --> 01:49:32,751
sudden five minutes in the light would 
be on like,

2491
01:49:32,751 --> 01:49:34,080
why is the light on?
I have 10 more minutes ago.

2492
01:49:34,090 --> 01:49:39,090
It was [inaudible] been ceos in the room
and they would let people know that 

2493
01:49:39,090 --> 01:49:39,090
flashed the light.
Well,

2494
01:49:39,090 --> 01:49:39,450
it was.
It was a problem.

2495
01:49:39,470 --> 01:49:44,470
It was a real problem.
It's also the people that were running 

2496
01:49:44,470 --> 01:49:46,101
the comedy store.
We're fucking retarded as well as the 

2497
01:49:46,101 --> 01:49:47,470
people that were running these agencies 
were fucking retarded.

2498
01:49:47,650 --> 01:49:48,040
Like the

2499
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:53,260
conversation that I had with my agents 
when they were telling me that I had to 

2500
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:55,060
either apologize to him or they were 
going to drop me.

2501
01:49:55,240 --> 01:50:00,240
I go,
do you guys understand what you're 

2502
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:01,771
doing?
Because you're making a decision right 

2503
01:50:01,771 --> 01:50:01,771
now.
You're calling it business.

2504
01:50:01,771 --> 01:50:02,530
You're making a decision that's going to
affect the rest of your life.

2505
01:50:02,710 --> 01:50:05,800
You're supporting criminal and all you 
sell is art.

2506
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:07,960
All you sell is art.
It's all you guys do.

2507
01:50:07,990 --> 01:50:09,730
You don't.
You don't produce widgets.

2508
01:50:09,820 --> 01:50:14,820
You guys aren't building cars.
You guys are set your sellers of other 

2509
01:50:14,820 --> 01:50:19,111
people's art.
That's what an agent is and what you 

2510
01:50:19,111 --> 01:50:20,350
have here is a guy who's stealing art 
and selling it.

2511
01:50:20,590 --> 01:50:23,650
You have a vampire and you're.
You're taking this vampire.

2512
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:27,490
He will suck the blood of the creative 
geniuses that you have on your roster.

2513
01:50:27,970 --> 01:50:30,100
But meanwhile the opposite has happened.

2514
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:31,720
Louis C,
k left them immediately.

2515
01:50:31,721 --> 01:50:34,420
David tell left them.
Nick Swardson left them with people that

2516
01:50:34,421 --> 01:50:35,290
found out about them.
What?

2517
01:50:35,291 --> 01:50:37,720
Fuck this.
Then he left them.

2518
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:43,080
So the whole thing was a disaster for 
Gersh from the agency at the time and 

2519
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:45,850
you know that they've really never 
recovered.

2520
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:49,000
I mean it's,
it's always a little bit.

2521
01:50:49,001 --> 01:50:51,730
I left for other reasons.
It was a fucking disaster for them.

2522
01:50:51,780 --> 01:50:56,780
I mean,
they lost a fuck load of money because 

2523
01:50:56,780 --> 01:50:59,371
of that one conversation that we had 
over the phone where I would've stayed 

2524
01:50:59,371 --> 01:50:59,371
with them.
I'm like,

2525
01:50:59,371 --> 01:50:59,880
if you want to defend this Douche bag,
you know,

2526
01:50:59,890 --> 01:51:02,350
I don't give a fuck.
I've been my agent for years.

2527
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:03,610
You know,
I liked the guy who,

2528
01:51:03,611 --> 01:51:05,620
I'm not going to name him,
he's a good dude.

2529
01:51:05,980 --> 01:51:09,460
But he was being put into position by 
the guy who owned the company that like,

2530
01:51:09,461 --> 01:51:14,461
look,
this guy is calling me up saying he 

2531
01:51:14,461 --> 01:51:16,621
demands that,
that joe apologize to him and he wants 

2532
01:51:16,621 --> 01:51:17,470
it to be a big deal and like,
fuck you.

2533
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:18,880
I'm like,
I'd rather be homeless.

2534
01:51:18,940 --> 01:51:23,940
And basically for people to really 
understand that the reason was because 

2535
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:24,400
at the time he was a bigger star than 
you.

2536
01:51:24,410 --> 01:51:26,670
Right.
That's where the power play was.

2537
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:31,900
He was on.
But I was big enough star that I 

2538
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:31,930
couldn't be hurt by it.
It was rich.

2539
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:33,130
I'm like,
what are you going to do?

2540
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:37,120
I was on fear factor at the time.
I had all this money and I'm like,

2541
01:51:37,121 --> 01:51:39,700
you can't hurt me.
And he tried.

2542
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:42,400
He tried to get me.
He got me banned from the comedy store.

2543
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:47,580
He tried to get my agency and this is a 
person in me where I'm already 

2544
01:51:47,770 --> 01:51:49,960
untouchable in that sense,
like really can't.

2545
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:51,580
You really can't dig in.
Like,

2546
01:51:51,581 --> 01:51:53,170
what are you going to do?
You're going to try though.

2547
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:57,550
So if I was a young comic coming up,
he would have had some real damage.

2548
01:51:57,860 --> 01:51:59,500
He could have done some real damage to 
me.

2549
01:51:59,580 --> 01:52:04,580
Well,
I'm sure there's probably untold amount 

2550
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:04,580
of young comics that he lifted from that
you have no idea of.

2551
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:09,060
Well,
a lot of them contacted me while that 

2552
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:10,300
was going on and some of them didn't 
want to be named and some of them didn't

2553
01:52:10,301 --> 01:52:14,980
mind if I named them.
But I think honestly that most likely he

2554
01:52:14,981 --> 01:52:18,310
stole almost everything he did and that 
he stole it from different sources.

2555
01:52:18,311 --> 01:52:23,311
And change it around,
but you've got that with a lot of 

2556
01:52:23,311 --> 01:52:23,311
comics.
You've got that over with a lot of,

2557
01:52:23,311 --> 01:52:25,090
a lot of,
like really shitty comedians make it.

2558
01:52:25,270 --> 01:52:30,270
And one of the ways they make is they 
take other people's ideas and they move 

2559
01:52:30,270 --> 01:52:30,270
them around.
Just enough.

2560
01:52:30,370 --> 01:52:31,960
Look even good comics.
Look,

2561
01:52:31,961 --> 01:52:33,310
Robin Williams,
who's,

2562
01:52:33,490 --> 01:52:36,940
you know,
has more talent or had more talented his

2563
01:52:36,941 --> 01:52:38,290
finger then I probably have been my 
whole body.

2564
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:40,780
And that's well known deal.
I know,

2565
01:52:40,781 --> 01:52:42,460
I know a comment personally,
you probably know them too,

2566
01:52:42,461 --> 01:52:43,960
but I won't name him for the purpose of 
this,

2567
01:52:43,961 --> 01:52:45,470
but who,
uh,

2568
01:52:45,650 --> 01:52:46,020
Robin's

2569
01:52:46,020 --> 01:52:51,020
stole a bit from,
didn't he never told him but then just 

2570
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:51,380
sent him a check.
You send him a $15,000

2571
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:52,250
check.
He did that.

2572
01:52:52,251 --> 01:52:57,251
So a lot of guys will get better as a 
performer than he was as a creative guy.

2573
01:52:58,860 --> 01:53:02,480
Someone who came up with the ideas 
you've ever heard that phrase.

2574
01:53:02,481 --> 01:53:05,190
Parallel evolution has that.
Uh,

2575
01:53:06,030 --> 01:53:09,950
so I had a comic when I was working in 
New York that I worked with almost every

2576
01:53:09,951 --> 01:53:12,720
night and he started lifting from people
and we all kind of knew at any,

2577
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:17,740
did exactly what you said it was like he
would take the premise but then just 

2578
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:20,050
tweak it enough that every time I'd be 
watching I'd go can't,

2579
01:53:20,140 --> 01:53:20,670
you know,
like,

2580
01:53:20,710 --> 01:53:25,710
but,
but we all knew and one night I finally 

2581
01:53:25,710 --> 01:53:25,710
confronted him,
he's still doing standard by the way,

2582
01:53:25,710 --> 01:53:27,290
and we've since become friends and he 
sort of apologized and whatever.

2583
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:29,300
And he said to me one night,
he goes,

2584
01:53:29,301 --> 01:53:29,990
Dave,
Dave,

2585
01:53:30,050 --> 01:53:35,050
don't you know about parallel evolution.
The premise being that with these jokes 

2586
01:53:35,050 --> 01:53:36,080
just evolve over,
you know,

2587
01:53:36,081 --> 01:53:38,000
if you're talking about sort of current 
event type things,

2588
01:53:38,001 --> 01:53:43,001
we're all going to,
a certain amount of it's just going to 

2589
01:53:43,001 --> 01:53:43,001
evolve at the same time was.
And I said,

2590
01:53:43,001 --> 01:53:43,070
I was about to say his name,
but I said,

2591
01:53:43,130 --> 01:53:44,480
uh,
I said,

2592
01:53:44,780 --> 01:53:49,780
not only are you lifting jokes,
you also made up a theory that's pretty 

2593
01:53:50,021 --> 01:53:52,010
good.
If you could apply that sort of creative

2594
01:53:52,011 --> 01:53:54,770
thinking to your jokes,
maybe we wouldn't be in this problem and

2595
01:53:54,771 --> 01:53:57,110
that is part of the problem is that a 
lot of these people,

2596
01:53:57,160 --> 01:54:02,160
they have a self defeating tendency and 
that's self defeating tendency is that 

2597
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:05,801
they don't.
They're not willing to put in the work 

2598
01:54:05,801 --> 01:54:07,661
because they're afraid of failure,
so instead they see success and they 

2599
01:54:07,661 --> 01:54:09,650
just duplicate it and they literally 
duplicated in the premise,

2600
01:54:09,990 --> 01:54:11,060
duplicate the premises.

2601
01:54:11,210 --> 01:54:14,270
They duplicate the pathway to getting to
the end of the joke,

2602
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:15,950
but the one thing they can't duplicate 
is,

2603
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:18,260
you know what I mean,
and that that's at the end of the day,

2604
01:54:18,261 --> 01:54:23,261
that's all we have.
Forget whether it's stand up or whether 

2605
01:54:23,261 --> 01:54:24,200
it's radio or on your,
like what you have.

2606
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:29,560
The thing that at the end of the day 
they come to you is something that you 

2607
01:54:29,560 --> 01:54:29,560
can't really quantify,
right?

2608
01:54:29,560 --> 01:54:34,061
Like you just people understand a 
certain series of things about you that 

2609
01:54:34,061 --> 01:54:34,061
they like.
So if the average person,

2610
01:54:34,061 --> 01:54:35,510
why do you like Rogan?
They could lay out a couple of things,

2611
01:54:35,810 --> 01:54:38,600
but there's that other thing that just 
is there.

2612
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:41,750
They can't duplicate you bought in the 
case of a guy like Robin Williams.

2613
01:54:41,751 --> 01:54:45,680
He can do all the things that you do 
that people like.

2614
01:54:45,770 --> 01:54:50,770
Well,
it becomes a problem because if he goes 

2615
01:54:50,770 --> 01:54:52,751
on before you.
And that was one of the things that he 

2616
01:54:52,751 --> 01:54:56,021
would do,
he would steal someone's bit and then 

2617
01:54:56,021 --> 01:54:56,060
bring them on because the comedy store,
you tag team,

2618
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:59,030
you would go on and you would say,
thank you very much.

2619
01:54:59,030 --> 01:55:04,030
Good night.
All right this next comment because you 

2620
01:55:04,030 --> 01:55:04,030
know,
and you'd bring up your friend,

2621
01:55:04,030 --> 01:55:04,030
right?
So no MC,

2622
01:55:04,030 --> 01:55:08,350
no Mc at the comedy store.
And he would bring on guys right after 

2623
01:55:08,350 --> 01:55:11,911
he did their closing bit and he would do
it to fuck with them and he would do it 

2624
01:55:11,911 --> 01:55:12,110
because he had some power,
you know?

2625
01:55:12,111 --> 01:55:15,590
And because the Mexican community is 
desperately looking for star Comedians,

2626
01:55:15,591 --> 01:55:17,950
I mean they have a,
they have a few of them.

2627
01:55:18,490 --> 01:55:21,500
Like George Lopez was always a big one.
And Gabriel,

2628
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:25,910
Gabriel Iglesias is a big one.
He sells out everywhere,

2629
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:30,260
but he's a really nice guy.
And the difference being that men,

2630
01:55:30,310 --> 01:55:31,340
ceos,
not really Mexican,

2631
01:55:31,490 --> 01:55:32,130
that was,
you know,

2632
01:55:32,180 --> 01:55:33,920
it was,
he was completely concocted.

2633
01:55:33,950 --> 01:55:38,950
Yeah.
And that's what really did him in more 

2634
01:55:38,950 --> 01:55:38,950
than anything,
it was a fake name.

2635
01:55:38,950 --> 01:55:38,950
What?
Wait,

2636
01:55:38,950 --> 01:55:39,680
what was Israel?
Israeli illness.

2637
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:42,070
And what about,
what's the other one?

2638
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:47,080
Uh,
the one of the redneck guys were 

2639
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:49,390
electric bob or frigerators south.
The cable guy.

2640
01:55:49,391 --> 01:55:50,810
And what's his real name?
And he said,

2641
01:55:51,090 --> 01:55:52,270
Dan Whitney.
And it's like,

2642
01:55:52,271 --> 01:55:54,210
yeah.
But Dan was jokes.

2643
01:55:54,211 --> 01:55:59,211
Yeah.
I don't mind someone like dice clay's 

2644
01:55:59,211 --> 01:55:59,211
real name was in dice clay.
Andrew Silverstein.

2645
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:04,460
I was at a party a couple of weeks ago 
and a dice was there and I was never a 

2646
01:56:04,460 --> 01:56:04,920
huge,
huge fan of his.

2647
01:56:04,921 --> 01:56:07,920
But I do remember around whatever that 
was,

2648
01:56:07,921 --> 01:56:12,921
maybe 89 slash 90,
maybe a little later when he sold out 

2649
01:56:12,921 --> 01:56:12,921
the garden.
And when he was in that,

2650
01:56:12,921 --> 01:56:15,510
you know,
that year of just sanity.

2651
01:56:15,810 --> 01:56:18,450
I remember watching that and thinking 
like,

2652
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:23,540
this is incredible.
Like it was one of the things that 

2653
01:56:23,540 --> 01:56:25,731
really sparked me with standup because 
even though I didn't love the material 

2654
01:56:25,731 --> 01:56:26,520
and I understood that how stupid the 
jokes were sort of,

2655
01:56:26,690 --> 01:56:29,820
but I was like,
the power of this is fucking amazing.

2656
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:35,390
And so I went up to him at this party 
and I tapped my shoulder and I just 

2657
01:56:35,390 --> 01:56:35,390
said,
Dave comic,

2658
01:56:35,390 --> 01:56:35,390
Blah Blah.
He was like,

2659
01:56:35,390 --> 01:56:35,930
yeah,
good.

2660
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:37,530
And then walked away.
Like I was like,

2661
01:56:37,531 --> 01:56:40,610
wow.
Because I've had such good.

2662
01:56:40,710 --> 01:56:45,710
I'm sure you've had this too when you,
when you've met comics over the years 

2663
01:56:45,710 --> 01:56:48,441
that you really admire.
Pretty much every single one that I've 

2664
01:56:48,441 --> 01:56:51,681
ever admired.
When I lived on the upper west in New 

2665
01:56:51,681 --> 01:56:54,140
York,
I lived about two blocks away from 

2666
01:56:54,140 --> 01:56:55,491
Seinfeld,
so I'd bumped into him a lot and he was 

2667
01:56:55,491 --> 01:56:58,280
a little hot and cold,
but like basically like there was the 

2668
01:56:58,280 --> 01:56:58,280
comic bond,
you know what I mean?

2669
01:56:58,280 --> 01:56:58,280
Like,
yeah.

2670
01:56:58,280 --> 01:56:58,980
And I was just,
dice was just,

2671
01:56:59,250 --> 01:57:04,250
he was so over it.
That's unfortunate because he's become 

2672
01:57:04,250 --> 01:57:05,470
his persona.
Well,

2673
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:07,710
he's dressed them,
but you know,

2674
01:57:07,711 --> 01:57:10,770
he wasn't always that guy like that 
dressing,

2675
01:57:10,771 --> 01:57:11,550
that whole thing.

2676
01:57:11,790 --> 01:57:16,790
That was a character in Andrew 
Silverstein's act like the dice man was 

2677
01:57:17,371 --> 01:57:21,030
a guy who would do that was basically 
Jerry Lewis and the nutty professor.

2678
01:57:21,650 --> 01:57:23,370
Like if you've never seen the nutty 
professor,

2679
01:57:23,550 --> 01:57:26,250
it's a great movie and one of the things
that's great about it,

2680
01:57:26,251 --> 01:57:31,251
it's Jerry Lewis is like this nerdy guy 
who takes a potion that was approached 

2681
01:57:31,290 --> 01:57:33,900
and it becomes this super cool daddio 
guy,

2682
01:57:33,901 --> 01:57:36,240
you know,
this is like 19 fucking whatever it was.

2683
01:57:36,241 --> 01:57:41,241
50 something probably,
and it's a hilarious movie because you 

2684
01:57:41,241 --> 01:57:45,941
know,
ultimately this guy becomes this guy 

2685
01:57:45,941 --> 01:57:47,730
that the ladies love and then the 
promotion starts wearing off and he goes

2686
01:57:47,731 --> 01:57:52,260
back to being as nerdy self again and 
dice is that guy.

2687
01:57:52,261 --> 01:57:52,820
I mean,
that's,

2688
01:57:52,850 --> 01:57:57,850
that's who he is on stage.
While it was only a part of his act and 

2689
01:57:57,850 --> 01:57:59,250
then it became the best part of his act 
and then it became his act.

2690
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:02,270
Then it became him outside.
So like,

2691
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:04,440
so now you see him walking around the 
street,

2692
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:09,560
he's got the weightlifting gloves on.
He just got a jacket with the fucking.

2693
01:58:09,661 --> 01:58:12,390
It's got all the glitter on it and shut.
It's be dazzled.

2694
01:58:12,630 --> 01:58:13,300
I mean,
it's,

2695
01:58:13,890 --> 01:58:15,490
he's A.
I,

2696
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:17,730
I have,
I'm happy he exists though.

2697
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:22,790
I enjoy him for sure.
And think about like the fact that at 

2698
01:58:22,790 --> 01:58:23,930
that if you watch that Madison Square 
Garden special,

2699
01:58:23,980 --> 01:58:25,890
that all on youtube,
you can watch it.

2700
01:58:26,430 --> 01:58:30,840
People are announcing the jokes before 
he even finishes the premise.

2701
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:36,500
That was the power.
That's where it showed to me the power 

2702
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:36,500
of standup.
Like I always loved.

2703
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:39,090
I remember what got me into standup was 
I was four years old,

2704
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:41,320
1986,
maybe 19,

2705
01:58:41,321 --> 01:58:46,321
83.
I saw bill cosby himself on Hbo and I 

2706
01:58:46,321 --> 01:58:47,740
was on the floor even though I probably 
don't even really understand what he was

2707
01:58:47,741 --> 01:58:48,370
talking about.

2708
01:58:48,610 --> 01:58:52,630
I thought this was the greatest thing 
ever.

2709
01:58:53,150 --> 01:58:54,310
You know,
you're growing up by the way,

2710
01:58:54,311 --> 01:58:57,640
when your childhood hero becomes a 
serial rapist,

2711
01:58:58,100 --> 01:59:01,030
most successful series of all time.
Yeah.

2712
01:59:01,230 --> 01:59:02,170
Um,
but that,

2713
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:04,820
that sparked it in me,
that sparked laughter and,

2714
01:59:04,821 --> 01:59:07,390
and wanting to make people laugh and 
loving comedy for me.

2715
01:59:07,670 --> 01:59:09,220
Uh,
but the nice thing was like,

2716
01:59:09,250 --> 01:59:10,420
Holy Shit,
this is a real.

2717
01:59:10,450 --> 01:59:15,450
Now I understand the show to um,
well his standup was different in that 

2718
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:19,840
not only did you know the punchline but 
the whole lines would sing a song.

2719
01:59:19,860 --> 01:59:24,860
Yeah.
So they wanted to hear the same jokes 

2720
01:59:24,860 --> 01:59:26,911
again,
which is very different from other 

2721
01:59:26,911 --> 01:59:26,911
standup with stand up most of the time.
You want to hear the new bits.

2722
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:27,400
Yeah.
Well,

2723
01:59:27,401 --> 01:59:32,401
you know,
people want to hear shit they haven't 

2724
01:59:32,401 --> 01:59:32,401
heard before and I know that even 
talking about Cosby,

2725
01:59:32,401 --> 01:59:35,260
it's hard to do at this point because 
everyone associates such terrible stuff.

2726
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:40,260
But I did see him live a couple of times
and one of the most amazing things that 

2727
01:59:40,260 --> 01:59:41,770
I ever saw a comic do ever was that,
you know,

2728
01:59:41,890 --> 01:59:43,930
everyone knew that whole himself 
special.

2729
01:59:44,290 --> 01:59:45,790
Every comic loved it.
Pretty much.

2730
01:59:45,791 --> 01:59:50,791
So many from Chris Rock,
the Seinfeld to a zillion people credit 

2731
01:59:50,791 --> 01:59:53,341
that with like being one of their 
seminal things and the records and all 

2732
01:59:53,341 --> 01:59:55,951
that.
And I saw cosby maybe 10 years ago in 

2733
01:59:55,951 --> 01:59:57,700
Jersey and he was doing all new stuff 
and you know,

2734
01:59:57,701 --> 01:59:58,600
it was kind of,
you know,

2735
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:03,720
by his last 10 years,
haven't been that kind to him and even 

2736
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:03,760
just the way he looks and he's had some 
health things,

2737
02:00:03,761 --> 02:00:05,380
like just what none of it was that 
great.

2738
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:09,190
But then at the end he goes,
I'm going to do one old bit for you.

2739
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:11,140
And he said,
I know you all know it.

2740
02:00:11,350 --> 02:00:13,300
I know you all know it,
but I'm gonna do one little bit for you.

2741
02:00:13,301 --> 02:00:16,660
And he did the dentist routine and 
everyone knew it,

2742
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:20,590
but he was such a master that he was,
it was like watching him.

2743
02:00:20,591 --> 02:00:25,591
It was like watching someone with clay 
because he could take the last before 

2744
02:00:25,591 --> 02:00:27,220
they were coming and then just change it
enough to keep them going more.

2745
02:00:27,430 --> 02:00:29,740
And they weren't yelling out the 
punchlines because it wasn't as,

2746
02:00:29,741 --> 02:00:32,950
you know,
like didactic or just set as,

2747
02:00:33,010 --> 02:00:35,580
as a dice.
But like it was,

2748
02:00:35,620 --> 02:00:40,620
it was amazing to watch to do comedy and
invent your old bit that you've now 

2749
02:00:40,620 --> 02:00:45,241
reinvented a thousand times.
And they know it all and it was like as 

2750
02:00:45,241 --> 02:00:46,540
good as ever it was,
it was amazing to watch his old stuff.

2751
02:00:46,570 --> 02:00:51,570
I mean in the time it's.
And that is a thing that you need to 

2752
02:00:51,570 --> 02:00:51,570
take into consideration when you watch 
standup standup,

2753
02:00:51,570 --> 02:00:55,030
a sort of a,
it's sort of a time machine.

2754
02:00:55,150 --> 02:01:00,150
It's a time capsule and like that's why 
you can go back and listen to Lenny 

2755
02:01:00,490 --> 02:01:03,160
Bruce who is arguably the most important
standup comic ever.

2756
02:01:03,460 --> 02:01:04,810
And he's not very funny.
Yeah.

2757
02:01:04,870 --> 02:01:06,340
It's just not,
it's not very good today.

2758
02:01:06,341 --> 02:01:11,341
And this is coming from someone who has 
lenny bruce posters framed in his house 

2759
02:01:11,341 --> 02:01:12,390
and I have Lenny Bruce live at the 
fillmore in,

2760
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:13,150
in my,
uh,

2761
02:01:13,210 --> 02:01:14,750
my office.
I mean she's,

2762
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:17,290
in my opinion,
the most important guy ever.

2763
02:01:17,320 --> 02:01:19,630
Well he changed the art definitely 
simply.

2764
02:01:19,631 --> 02:01:22,900
He just fucking tore that thing down.
We are not going to do jokes like that.

2765
02:01:22,901 --> 02:01:25,660
We're going to talk about real shit.
And he opened it for everybody,

2766
02:01:26,050 --> 02:01:31,050
period.
And I think that's often the case with a

2767
02:01:31,361 --> 02:01:35,020
lot of the greats.
Like a lot of the old Carlin stuff is in

2768
02:01:35,021 --> 02:01:36,460
that vein,
like a,

2769
02:01:36,461 --> 02:01:41,461
I understand its position in the,
but if you watch it or listen to it 

2770
02:01:41,461 --> 02:01:42,440
today,
it's really not that good.

2771
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:47,670
You know,
it's interesting the case with Cosby as 

2772
02:01:47,670 --> 02:01:47,670
well,
so,

2773
02:01:47,670 --> 02:01:50,140
so cosby for a while and especially now 
cosby has this other thing attached to 

2774
02:01:50,140 --> 02:01:51,280
them that it's,
it just becomes impossible to remove it.

2775
02:01:51,290 --> 02:01:53,320
It's so lined up together.
Carlin,

2776
02:01:53,321 --> 02:01:56,900
so I had Kelly Carlin on this week was a
George's daughter who's a good friend of

2777
02:01:56,901 --> 02:02:01,901
mine and we talked a lot.
We talked about that and we related at 

2778
02:02:01,901 --> 02:02:01,901
all to everything else we've been 
talking about here,

2779
02:02:01,901 --> 02:02:05,540
the social justice stuff and language 
and words and you know,

2780
02:02:05,630 --> 02:02:07,760
being afraid to hear certain ideas and 
all that.

2781
02:02:07,761 --> 02:02:09,740
So it was really,
really interesting conversation.

2782
02:02:10,100 --> 02:02:15,100
And uh,
I watched a bunch of Georgia stuff just 

2783
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:15,100
in preparation.
I've seen it all a thousand times,

2784
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:18,110
but I thought actually a lot of it's 
still does some of it.

2785
02:02:18,260 --> 02:02:23,260
Yeah,
the seven dirty words sorta seemed 

2786
02:02:23,260 --> 02:02:23,260
ridiculous now in a certain way,
but it's still pretty good.

2787
02:02:23,260 --> 02:02:26,510
Like,
and even his last hbo special is fucking

2788
02:02:26,810 --> 02:02:28,520
perfection.
It,

2789
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:29,120
I,
I,

2790
02:02:29,210 --> 02:02:34,210
I've asked her this before.
He knew his health was failing at the 

2791
02:02:34,210 --> 02:02:37,391
time.
I don't think he knew he was gonna die 

2792
02:02:37,391 --> 02:02:39,761
only a few months later,
but in a lot of ways if you watch it 

2793
02:02:39,761 --> 02:02:40,820
knowing that he perhaps thought it was 
his last special,

2794
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:44,210
it brings it to a whole other level 
because he ends it.

2795
02:02:44,211 --> 02:02:48,080
Really just wrapping up,
like wrapping up a 40 year.

2796
02:02:48,350 --> 02:02:49,550
Here's what I think about everything.
It's,

2797
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:51,080
it's pure brilliance.
Well,

2798
02:02:51,081 --> 02:02:55,400
he did a new special every year,
so when you have that much material,

2799
02:02:55,401 --> 02:02:57,680
you're going to have some hits and some 
misses.

2800
02:02:57,681 --> 02:03:00,050
But he certainly had way more hits and 
he had messes.

2801
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:00,740
Sure.
He had,

2802
02:03:00,770 --> 02:03:04,370
he had like a five year,
I think sort of low I guess maybe in the

2803
02:03:04,371 --> 02:03:09,371
mid nineties or something where I 
thought it became just too much about 

2804
02:03:09,371 --> 02:03:09,371
cursing and whatever.

2805
02:03:09,371 --> 02:03:11,660
But beyond that,
that guy,

2806
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,810
I think that represented a low in his 
life though you.

2807
02:03:14,890 --> 02:03:17,210
He had some issues in his own life,
personal life.

2808
02:03:17,690 --> 02:03:18,270
But I,
I'm,

2809
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:20,570
when I was referring to was his old 
stuff.

2810
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:22,700
If you go back to when he looked like a 
weatherman.

2811
02:03:22,701 --> 02:03:27,701
Oh,
you're talking about before he became 

2812
02:03:27,701 --> 02:03:28,310
the George Carlin,
if you go back and put that time capsule

2813
02:03:28,311 --> 02:03:30,770
and try to like wash that today,
it's not really that funny.

2814
02:03:30,890 --> 02:03:33,200
You know,
who is really interesting.

2815
02:03:33,470 --> 02:03:36,890
The old stuff is woody allen.
Woody Allen's also,

2816
02:03:36,891 --> 02:03:41,891
first of all,
he's a fucking pervert and his old 

2817
02:03:41,891 --> 02:03:42,410
stuff.
It's so weird.

2818
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:45,020
Yeah.
Well look at all leaked into his movies,

2819
02:03:45,410 --> 02:03:48,670
his strange sexual stuff and young girls
and you know,

2820
02:03:49,070 --> 02:03:51,120
you know,
how old was Mariel Hemingway in,

2821
02:03:51,140 --> 02:03:52,250
in Manhattan?
She was,

2822
02:03:52,251 --> 02:03:57,251
was first off,
she played under age and I don't know 

2823
02:03:57,251 --> 02:03:57,251
how old she was.

2824
02:03:57,251 --> 02:03:57,251
Yeah,
she was like 17 or something.

2825
02:03:57,251 --> 02:03:58,140
How old was she?
She was,

2826
02:03:58,350 --> 02:03:59,900
it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter,

2827
02:03:59,901 --> 02:04:00,960
but yeah.
Umm,

2828
02:04:01,510 --> 02:04:04,700
but comedy isn't in a weird way.
Like here's,

2829
02:04:04,730 --> 02:04:06,180
here's a good example.
Uh,

2830
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:11,320
Eddie Murphy raw at the time was like 
this monster standup thing that 

2831
02:04:11,781 --> 02:04:13,430
everybody had to see.
Oh my God,

2832
02:04:13,431 --> 02:04:14,300
I saw it.
I was crying.

2833
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:16,670
Try watching that today.
First of all,

2834
02:04:16,671 --> 02:04:19,430
you want to talk about homophobia,
homophobia,

2835
02:04:19,640 --> 02:04:22,580
but violently aggressively homophobic.
Yeah.

2836
02:04:22,610 --> 02:04:27,610
Which is really weird when you consider 
all the allegations that have surfaced 

2837
02:04:27,610 --> 02:04:31,811
since with him and transgender people 
and transsexuals and picking up hookers 

2838
02:04:31,811 --> 02:04:33,680
that were men like it's.
It's very,

2839
02:04:33,681 --> 02:04:35,930
very strange.
Isn't it funny that we try to get.

2840
02:04:36,460 --> 02:04:38,160
Look at Oscar Wilde said,
you know,

2841
02:04:38,161 --> 02:04:39,810
if you want to tell people the truth,
you have to be funny.

2842
02:04:39,811 --> 02:04:41,610
I think it was asking about.
Maybe it was lily Tomlin.

2843
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:43,690
My total.
It's something I can't remember.

2844
02:04:43,950 --> 02:04:46,360
One of them,
I don't know how nice man,

2845
02:04:50,310 --> 02:04:52,700
but you know,
it's funny that we try as,

2846
02:04:52,701 --> 02:04:57,701
as a society,
like so many of the people that of 

2847
02:04:57,701 --> 02:04:59,961
course that we admired but that everyone
is my are comedians because we're 

2848
02:04:59,961 --> 02:05:00,810
supposed to tell the truth.
We are supposed to tell the truth and,

2849
02:05:00,811 --> 02:05:05,811
and then at the same time,
comedians are often either the sad clown

2850
02:05:05,881 --> 02:05:10,881
or severely emotionally crippled or 
wanting that approval thing before and 

2851
02:05:11,011 --> 02:05:14,880
all the lines that you were talking 
about and it's a really bizarre place.

2852
02:05:14,881 --> 02:05:19,881
So then when you get and you suddenly 
get all that approval and then it's 

2853
02:05:19,881 --> 02:05:21,960
like,
can you still also grow as a human while

2854
02:05:21,961 --> 02:05:26,961
you're getting approval for something 
that came out of some disfunction and I 

2855
02:05:26,961 --> 02:05:28,530
know this is the Angeles comedian 
discussion,

2856
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:31,260
you have to adjust what,
why you do it,

2857
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:36,680
you know,
you have to do it for other people 

2858
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:36,680
instead of doing it for yourself and you
have to do it for the,

2859
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:36,900
for the art,
for the work.

2860
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:41,880
And the work is profoundly enjoyable for
people that love standup.

2861
02:05:42,180 --> 02:05:44,430
It's like if you're a painter and you 
only paint for yourself,

2862
02:05:44,431 --> 02:05:48,780
well you know at a certain point in time
you're running out of shit to paint when

2863
02:05:48,781 --> 02:05:53,781
you're painting,
I guess expressing yourself or the 

2864
02:05:53,781 --> 02:05:54,270
desires of other people.
I think then it becomes different.

2865
02:05:54,300 --> 02:05:59,300
Yeah.
I saw George Carlin once just a little 

2866
02:05:59,300 --> 02:06:02,271
bit before he died also on the view and 
he was talking about the art lord poor 

2867
02:06:02,271 --> 02:06:03,710
man.
Guy took years off his life.

2868
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,270
We still have George today if you didn't
make other thing that.

2869
02:06:06,271 --> 02:06:08,250
I think he died that later that day.

2870
02:06:10,680 --> 02:06:15,680
But he said,
he said something that I thought it was 

2871
02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:15,680
really great.
He said,

2872
02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:16,230
you know,
he said when I became a good comment was

2873
02:06:16,231 --> 02:06:18,310
when I got over the need.
Yeah.

2874
02:06:18,510 --> 02:06:21,470
And I think that it's a good lesson for 
humans in general,

2875
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:26,480
just for people like getting over the 
whatever the need is of yourself and we 

2876
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:27,030
all struggle with this.
Of course I struggle with it as a person

2877
02:06:27,031 --> 02:06:30,000
and as a comic and a host or whatever it
is.

2878
02:06:30,220 --> 02:06:33,090
Like we all have that shit and,
and wanting all that approval.

2879
02:06:33,091 --> 02:06:38,091
But when you can get over that and just 
and really do things for the right clean

2880
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:41,490
reasons and,
and live in and at the same time live in

2881
02:06:41,491 --> 02:06:45,360
a way that honors all those things that 
you stand up for.

2882
02:06:46,150 --> 02:06:48,960
I think that's like the secret,
like that's the,

2883
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:51,840
that's the sauce.
Like that's what we should all be trying

2884
02:06:51,841 --> 02:06:52,350
to do at.

2885
02:06:52,640 --> 02:06:54,610
And it transcends,
you know,

2886
02:06:54,950 --> 02:06:58,230
professional transcends comedy and it 
transcends everything pretty much.

2887
02:06:58,410 --> 02:06:59,460
Yeah.
I think you're,

2888
02:06:59,730 --> 02:07:04,730
I think you're onto it.
And I think also that that process of 

2889
02:07:04,730 --> 02:07:08,121
like the need is,
is that's the fuel that gets you off the

2890
02:07:08,161 --> 02:07:13,161
earth and away from the effects of 
gravity and then the momentum of that 

2891
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:18,920
sort of carries you on,
but you don't necessarily have to keep 

2892
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:21,960
that fucking jet engine fire under your 
asshole all the time.

2893
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:23,910
It's.
But that doesn't,

2894
02:07:23,911 --> 02:07:28,560
that explained sorta like a white angst 
and being fucked up or whatever it is.

2895
02:07:28,561 --> 02:07:33,561
You know,
when they say comics are all fucked up 

2896
02:07:33,561 --> 02:07:33,561
or whatever,
you need a certain amount of that.

2897
02:07:33,561 --> 02:07:33,561
Oh you do.
To get going,

2898
02:07:33,561 --> 02:07:34,920
you know.
And for a look,

2899
02:07:34,921 --> 02:07:35,980
I did stand up.
Think about

2900
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:37,060
this.
I did stand up.

2901
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:38,770
We've only known each other for whatever
it is,

2902
02:07:38,771 --> 02:07:43,771
two hours now.
I just signed up for about 10 years in 

2903
02:07:43,771 --> 02:07:46,201
the closet now.
I was mostly doing political stuff and 

2904
02:07:46,201 --> 02:07:49,171
social stuff.
It wasn't like I wasn't like outwardly 

2905
02:07:49,171 --> 02:07:49,171
lying all the time and being like,
ah,

2906
02:07:49,171 --> 02:07:49,171
fuck this chicken that,
you know,

2907
02:07:49,171 --> 02:07:53,741
like it wasn't like that.
But like I constantly was avoiding the 

2908
02:07:53,741 --> 02:07:53,790
truth onstage or if,
you know,

2909
02:07:53,791 --> 02:07:56,710
if I was getting heckled,
there were easy ways that I would insert

2910
02:07:56,750 --> 02:07:58,360
it.
Implied that I was straight or,

2911
02:07:58,361 --> 02:08:03,361
and I'm sure time,
I'm 100 percent sure there were times 

2912
02:08:03,361 --> 02:08:03,580
that I made it seem like I was straight 
or something like that,

2913
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:08,960
but that,
that angst and that fuel really made me 

2914
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:12,721
successful really quick.
Like I was passed at the comedy cellar 

2915
02:08:12,721 --> 02:08:15,970
like a year into doing standup and then,
and then a couple of years later,

2916
02:08:16,360 --> 02:08:20,110
like it basically all crumbled on me 
because I realized that my life,

2917
02:08:20,170 --> 02:08:24,850
my person life was way behind where my 
art was.

2918
02:08:25,060 --> 02:08:30,060
And then I ended up doing gay shows,
which was another fucking nightmare 

2919
02:08:30,060 --> 02:08:31,330
because if you're a gay comic,
they have one at every club,

2920
02:08:31,331 --> 02:08:31,930
right?
Like there's,

2921
02:08:31,931 --> 02:08:34,600
there's sort of one like stereotypical 
gay comic.

2922
02:08:34,780 --> 02:08:37,880
And then suddenly I was the gay comic 
and I don't act that gay,

2923
02:08:37,881 --> 02:08:40,300
whatever the hell that means.
So I wasn't even gay enough for them.

2924
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:45,720
And I ended up.
Then I ended up on a gay TV channel on 

2925
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:46,930
here TV,
which was this like premium gay channel,

2926
02:08:47,080 --> 02:08:49,960
and then I ended up on the gay channel 
on Sirius Xm.

2927
02:08:50,140 --> 02:08:55,140
I want to talk about politics and 
instead I was fucking interviewing real 

2928
02:08:55,140 --> 02:08:58,981
housewives and all that shit and it had 
nothing to do with anything I wanted to 

2929
02:08:59,861 --> 02:09:03,880
do.
Everybody's path is crazy and weird.

2930
02:09:04,030 --> 02:09:09,030
Well,
your paths always going to be crazy and 

2931
02:09:09,030 --> 02:09:09,030
weird because we're human beings and I 
think you,

2932
02:09:09,030 --> 02:09:13,710
you've,
you're onto it as far as like this 

2933
02:09:13,710 --> 02:09:15,220
fucked up aspect of you that needs love 
so badly.

2934
02:09:15,221 --> 02:09:20,221
You want to go on stage with a spotlight
on you and a microphone to amplify your 

2935
02:09:20,221 --> 02:09:21,160
voice.
Pay attention to me.

2936
02:09:21,620 --> 02:09:26,620
Then once you get to that position,
it's up to you to figure out the trick 

2937
02:09:26,680 --> 02:09:30,760
because if you're a music a magician and
you believe that you're really pulling a

2938
02:09:30,761 --> 02:09:33,370
rabbit out of a fucking hat,
you're an idiot.

2939
02:09:33,660 --> 02:09:34,770
You know,
like you're,

2940
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:39,800
you're the guy with the trick and the 
trick is you know your voice is 

2941
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:39,850
amplified.
You're on the stage.

2942
02:09:39,851 --> 02:09:44,851
You figured out the cadence and the 
hypnotic rhythm in order to get people 

2943
02:09:44,851 --> 02:09:45,250
to laugh at your stuff,
but what?

2944
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:46,990
What?
What are you actually trying to do?

2945
02:09:46,990 --> 02:09:49,170
If you're still trying to fill holes,
will you?

2946
02:09:49,190 --> 02:09:50,530
You fucking missed it,
son.

2947
02:09:50,650 --> 02:09:53,710
That's just supposed to get you to the 
dance and once you're at the dance,

2948
02:09:53,711 --> 02:09:58,711
then it's supposed to be about creating 
the art and it's supposed to be about 

2949
02:09:58,711 --> 02:09:59,020
trying to figure out what is the best 
way to make something really funny?

2950
02:09:59,290 --> 02:10:01,230
What is the best way to make something 
so I.

2951
02:10:01,240 --> 02:10:06,240
I contribute to culture.
I contribute to people's entertainment 

2952
02:10:06,341 --> 02:10:07,600
value.
They go out,

2953
02:10:07,601 --> 02:10:08,710
they can say,
hey,

2954
02:10:08,860 --> 02:10:10,570
Dave Rubin has had the ice house 
tonight.

2955
02:10:10,750 --> 02:10:14,620
Let's go on out and have a good time,
and they leave there and they go,

2956
02:10:14,621 --> 02:10:16,510
that was fun.
Oh my God.

2957
02:10:16,511 --> 02:10:18,430
That was great.
That's the goal.

2958
02:10:18,431 --> 02:10:23,431
The goal is to.
You're changing the way people feel and 

2959
02:10:23,431 --> 02:10:24,220
you can do that with ideas and you've 
got to work them through,

2960
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:27,400
but yeah,
what gets you to the dance and the first

2961
02:10:27,401 --> 02:10:30,580
place is you're fucked up past your 
angst,

2962
02:10:30,581 --> 02:10:33,070
your insecurities.
You're all that shit.

2963
02:10:33,230 --> 02:10:37,190
It's a matter of the people that cling 
to those things and they'd never get 'em

2964
02:10:37,340 --> 02:10:42,340
never get rid of them.
Then they make it and they don't know 

2965
02:10:42,340 --> 02:10:42,340
what the fuck to do.

2966
02:10:42,340 --> 02:10:43,750
So that,
that's the really interesting part to me

2967
02:10:43,751 --> 02:10:46,090
because I lived on the upper west,
as I said,

2968
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:51,160
put that microphone closer to you.
You'll hear it more because we can hear 

2969
02:10:51,160 --> 02:10:51,400
each other.
Yeah.

2970
02:10:51,420 --> 02:10:53,650
When I get deep I start leaning into my 
left.

2971
02:10:53,651 --> 02:10:55,690
Um,
so I lived on the upper west,

2972
02:10:55,691 --> 02:11:00,691
which is like a bastion of comedians.
There's just a zillion comics that live 

2973
02:11:00,691 --> 02:11:04,201
up there.
Seinfeld lived up there and Elayne 

2974
02:11:04,201 --> 02:11:06,451
boosler lived up there and uh,
Taylor Negron who I met right before he 

2975
02:11:06,451 --> 02:11:06,820
died,
didn't even know I met him just a couple

2976
02:11:06,821 --> 02:11:08,470
of weeks before he was going to do my 
show.

2977
02:11:08,500 --> 02:11:09,840
He was a great guy,
great,

2978
02:11:09,841 --> 02:11:14,841
great guy.
Just a zillion and a lot of younger 

2979
02:11:14,841 --> 02:11:14,841
comics,
whatever.

2980
02:11:14,841 --> 02:11:14,980
But one,
I used to see Greg Giraldo all the time.

2981
02:11:14,981 --> 02:11:19,981
He lived a couple blocks away from me.
And so I think you'll find this really 

2982
02:11:19,981 --> 02:11:19,981
interesting.

2983
02:11:19,981 --> 02:11:20,440
I didn't,
I didn't know him personally,

2984
02:11:20,441 --> 02:11:22,900
but he knew I was a comic.
We just sort of nod when we were walking

2985
02:11:22,901 --> 02:11:26,440
by and uh,
one day I saw him walking,

2986
02:11:26,441 --> 02:11:31,441
his two kids,
he had his two young sons hand in hand 

2987
02:11:31,441 --> 02:11:31,441
and he was walking between them and I 
thought,

2988
02:11:31,441 --> 02:11:33,820
wow,
here's a guy who I respect as a comic,

2989
02:11:33,821 --> 02:11:36,100
like doing good shit.
He's funny,

2990
02:11:36,250 --> 02:11:41,250
he's real.
You could always tell there was like 

2991
02:11:41,250 --> 02:11:41,250
some pain there,
but like doing it,

2992
02:11:41,250 --> 02:11:45,961
you know,
he's getting certain chances like I 

2993
02:11:45,961 --> 02:11:46,390
think he never got like maybe whatever 
would have been his big chance,

2994
02:11:46,391 --> 02:11:48,730
but like it was,
he was in the mix and respecting.

2995
02:11:48,731 --> 02:11:51,040
Anyway.
Then the next day after that I saw him,

2996
02:11:51,130 --> 02:11:56,130
I went to Equinox,
was the gym I went to on the upper west 

2997
02:11:56,130 --> 02:11:56,130
and I saw him there.
He was working out and I was like,

2998
02:11:56,130 --> 02:11:57,760
look,
there's a guy just with his kids.

2999
02:11:57,761 --> 02:12:00,340
He's working out like it's all seems 
like it's working for this guy.

3000
02:12:00,341 --> 02:12:01,990
Like it actually gave me hope,
like,

3001
02:12:02,020 --> 02:12:07,020
oh,
I can become like a functioning person 

3002
02:12:07,020 --> 02:12:08,830
that weekend,
that weekend he was dead.

3003
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:12,340
I mean,
I don't know enough about him.

3004
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:14,380
Well,
I know him and it was,

3005
02:12:14,450 --> 02:12:16,860
it was a pill thing was a drug thing,
you know,

3006
02:12:16,861 --> 02:12:20,030
and that's,
I'm incredibly unfortunate.

3007
02:12:20,060 --> 02:12:23,540
I knew him when he had a television show
because when Greg had,

3008
02:12:23,541 --> 02:12:24,530
he,
he had a show,

3009
02:12:24,570 --> 02:12:25,490
um,
because,

3010
02:12:25,491 --> 02:12:30,491
you know,
Greg started out as a lawyer and he had 

3011
02:12:30,491 --> 02:12:32,330
a show on one of the networks.
I think NBC,

3012
02:12:32,370 --> 02:12:37,370
I don't think so because I was on NBC at
the time and I don't think we're on the 

3013
02:12:37,370 --> 02:12:38,780
same network.
I think it was ABC,

3014
02:12:38,781 --> 02:12:42,440
but it doesn't matter what matters is we
were on the same lot.

3015
02:12:42,500 --> 02:12:47,500
We're both on that sunset gower lot that
I was talking about and we were next 

3016
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:47,500
door to each other.
So I'd hang out with them,

3017
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:49,310
you know,
we're just fellow comics,

3018
02:12:49,340 --> 02:12:54,340
you know,
and that's the bond that we shared is 

3019
02:12:54,340 --> 02:12:54,340
it,
you know,

3020
02:12:54,340 --> 02:12:56,861
he had a lot more responsibility than me
because I was on this giant ensemble 

3021
02:12:56,861 --> 02:12:58,850
where I was the fifth or sixth person on
the.

3022
02:12:59,150 --> 02:13:00,920
When the credits roll,
you know,

3023
02:13:00,980 --> 02:13:03,680
it'd be like Phil Hartman or Dave Foley,
Mauritania.

3024
02:13:03,880 --> 02:13:06,020
So I had no pressure,
but he,

3025
02:13:06,050 --> 02:13:09,500
he had the Greg Giraldo show,
I don't remember what it was called,

3026
02:13:09,530 --> 02:13:14,530
but it was,
it was his show and he went from that 

3027
02:13:14,530 --> 02:13:18,110
and then he was really a big part of 
tough crowd with Colin Quinn.

3028
02:13:18,111 --> 02:13:20,450
And there's that great moment where he's
shut down.

3029
02:13:20,451 --> 02:13:25,451
Dennis leary on tough crowd is like one 
of my all time favorite moments on tough

3030
02:13:25,551 --> 02:13:30,551
crowd because Dennis was getting upset 
that Greg Geraldo had written jokes.

3031
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:32,040
He had funny things

3032
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:33,330
to say about certain things.
He goes,

3033
02:13:33,331 --> 02:13:34,080
yeah,
a Dennis.

3034
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:35,400
That's what we do.
We write it,

3035
02:13:35,401 --> 02:13:40,401
write jokes.
And it was just a classic moment with 

3036
02:13:40,401 --> 02:13:43,920
Dennis is wearing sunglasses inside.
Greg's like in the prime and Dennis has 

3037
02:13:43,921 --> 02:13:45,950
come in just horse shit.
Yeah.

3038
02:13:46,090 --> 02:13:48,060
Um,
but he,

3039
02:13:48,570 --> 02:13:53,570
he was a guy that I think was really 
respected by a lot of other comedians 

3040
02:13:53,570 --> 02:13:56,550
and was really good at roasts and in 
today's Day,

3041
02:13:56,750 --> 02:13:57,210
you know,
I mean,

3042
02:13:57,211 --> 02:14:02,211
he died a few years back.
He probably would be just right now 

3043
02:14:02,211 --> 02:14:05,331
crushing it like bill burris.
It'd be right now like be in his stride 

3044
02:14:05,331 --> 02:14:07,320
because I think that what he was doing 
and what he was was really good.

3045
02:14:07,490 --> 02:14:08,440
Yeah.
But that,

3046
02:14:08,441 --> 02:14:10,010
that goes to that.
Thanks man.

3047
02:14:10,050 --> 02:14:11,340
Demons.
I mean think about that.

3048
02:14:11,341 --> 02:14:13,440
Literally the day before,
and I'm looking at this guy going,

3049
02:14:13,441 --> 02:14:14,970
holy shit,
he's doing it.

3050
02:14:15,090 --> 02:14:18,360
That pill demon is a different,
different monster than the,

3051
02:14:18,361 --> 02:14:19,800
the opiate addict.

3052
02:14:19,830 --> 02:14:21,480
You know,
that's a different monster.

3053
02:14:21,780 --> 02:14:22,150
You know,
the,

3054
02:14:22,151 --> 02:14:25,500
the person who does meth or coke or you 
know,

3055
02:14:25,550 --> 02:14:28,650
the people that go hard as a totally 
different monster.

3056
02:14:28,900 --> 02:14:30,390
Yeah.
It scares the shit out of me,

3057
02:14:30,391 --> 02:14:33,180
man.
I mean I smoked a ton of pot in my day,

3058
02:14:33,190 --> 02:14:38,190
like pot yesterday.
I got my card a couple of weeks ago 

3059
02:14:38,190 --> 02:14:42,910
actually.
I went to the four slash 20 doctor on 

3060
02:14:42,910 --> 02:14:42,910
melrose.
Wanted to get a prescription,

3061
02:14:42,910 --> 02:14:47,560
isn't it?
I thought I'd have to go through a 

3062
02:14:47,560 --> 02:14:47,560
battery of tests.
Oh my God.

3063
02:14:47,560 --> 02:14:50,610
It was like a day of like probing and I 
thought I was being taken by joking.

3064
02:14:50,611 --> 02:14:51,410
By the way,
folks,

3065
02:14:51,420 --> 02:14:53,970
you want to be a fucking idiot to not 
get a prescription.

3066
02:14:53,971 --> 02:14:57,390
So I could not believe how easy it was.
I went in,

3067
02:14:57,391 --> 02:14:58,500
I literally,
I was like,

3068
02:14:58,510 --> 02:14:59,530
ah,
well I guess like,

3069
02:14:59,550 --> 02:15:01,290
I just wanted weed to smoke weed.

3070
02:15:01,290 --> 02:15:03,480
I don't have any real physical elements,
but I was like,

3071
02:15:03,481 --> 02:15:06,420
I'll tell him I get headaches,
my knees hurt after I play basketball,

3072
02:15:06,460 --> 02:15:08,190
back pain.
I mean the woman looked at me like,

3073
02:15:08,220 --> 02:15:11,370
shut the fuck up.
And then I went into.

3074
02:15:11,371 --> 02:15:16,371
I had never been to one of the stories.
One of the dispensary's went in there 

3075
02:15:16,371 --> 02:15:20,001
for.
I still can't believe I've only been 

3076
02:15:20,001 --> 02:15:21,621
there a couple of times now,
but I can't believe like just the level 

3077
02:15:21,621 --> 02:15:21,621
of,
it's a real salesperson,

3078
02:15:21,621 --> 02:15:24,430
you know,
candy and edibles and oil,

3079
02:15:24,490 --> 02:15:25,230
you know,
careful.

3080
02:15:25,450 --> 02:15:28,640
She wanted oils and uh,
uh,

3081
02:15:28,650 --> 02:15:31,160
so there's oils with a wax.
I was like,

3082
02:15:31,190 --> 02:15:33,210
you have any weed and weed for him.
Like is there any,

3083
02:15:33,211 --> 02:15:34,800
is that it left anymore?
Like,

3084
02:15:34,801 --> 02:15:36,180
just some bud.
So I got,

3085
02:15:36,181 --> 02:15:39,420
I got oil so it's all there.
It's available.

3086
02:15:39,450 --> 02:15:41,340
But yeah,
the problem is once you,

3087
02:15:41,341 --> 02:15:43,770
uh,
once you go down to the first floor,

3088
02:15:43,980 --> 02:15:44,600
you want to go,
what?

3089
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:46,110
Is there a basement then?
Yes,

3090
02:15:46,111 --> 02:15:48,180
there is a basement.
What's that door in the basement.

3091
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:53,360
That's the sub basement.
Let's look in the sub basement and then 

3092
02:15:53,360 --> 02:15:54,690
you start going deep and next thing you 
know you're in a spiral staircase.

3093
02:15:54,691 --> 02:15:56,400
I have.
How much pot these smoke?

3094
02:15:56,840 --> 02:16:01,840
Um,
I spoke a fair bit depending upon 

3095
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:01,920
whether or not I'm at the comedy store 
or not.

3096
02:16:01,921 --> 02:16:04,170
I enjoy getting high and going to the 
comedy store.

3097
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:09,920
I like to get high before I do Jujitsu.
I liked to get high before I give the 

3098
02:16:09,920 --> 02:16:13,161
misses a stabbing.
Nice to get high before I get an 

3099
02:16:13,161 --> 02:16:13,800
isolation tank.
Isolation tank.

3100
02:16:13,801 --> 02:16:15,450
I want to talk about that.
I liked,

3101
02:16:15,580 --> 02:16:17,160
I,
I enjoy marijuana.

3102
02:16:17,260 --> 02:16:18,480
Yeah,
that's one of my friends.

3103
02:16:18,540 --> 02:16:19,370
So I,
yeah,

3104
02:16:19,380 --> 02:16:23,050
I can tell you lit up.
It was great.

3105
02:16:23,340 --> 02:16:28,340
You know.
So also I'd like the fact that I 

3106
02:16:28,340 --> 02:16:28,710
represent the opposite of the 
stereotype.

3107
02:16:29,020 --> 02:16:30,440
You know,
you're doing shit.

3108
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:32,020
Yeah.
I don't buy it.

3109
02:16:32,021 --> 02:16:33,910
I don't buy that.
Marijuana makes you lazy.

3110
02:16:33,911 --> 02:16:37,360
I think you're fucking lazy.
I think you could be lazy and,

3111
02:16:37,410 --> 02:16:39,700
and eat cheetos.
Does that mean cheetos make you lazy?

3112
02:16:39,910 --> 02:16:42,400
You can be lazy and watch TV.
Does that mean TV makes you lazy?

3113
02:16:42,401 --> 02:16:47,401
I don't buy it.
I think we're looking for some reasons 

3114
02:16:47,401 --> 02:16:51,031
why people have flaws and their 
personality and I don't think you could 

3115
02:16:51,031 --> 02:16:52,510
say it's marijuana because marijuana 
have all good aspects to it know,

3116
02:16:52,690 --> 02:16:53,990
like many things.
It's,

3117
02:16:54,010 --> 02:16:56,920
it has good and bad.
The bad thing is the memory,

3118
02:16:57,610 --> 02:16:59,170
the memory thing is a bad thing.
Like what,

3119
02:16:59,260 --> 02:17:01,480
what were we talking about?
But that's fleeting,

3120
02:17:01,570 --> 02:17:03,070
you know,
like longterm memory,

3121
02:17:03,750 --> 02:17:07,960
long term memory is fucking fantastic.
It has to be because of the UFC.

3122
02:17:08,140 --> 02:17:09,140
Look,
I have a,

3123
02:17:09,141 --> 02:17:12,040
a bio when I do the UFC,
which uh,

3124
02:17:12,070 --> 02:17:17,070
will tell me like a fighters record tell
me who they're training with and tell 

3125
02:17:17,070 --> 02:17:17,070
me.

3126
02:17:17,070 --> 02:17:19,060
But when the matches are going on,
I'm not leafing through papers.

3127
02:17:19,061 --> 02:17:24,061
If I start talking about a fight that 
happened seven years ago in another 

3128
02:17:24,061 --> 02:17:24,760
organization,
it's because it's in my head,

3129
02:17:25,160 --> 02:17:30,160
you know,
and when I talked to people and they're 

3130
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:30,160
like,
what kind of preparation do you do?

3131
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:30,160
I'm like,
I'm not doing any preparation,

3132
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:34,920
the preparation that I am,
but I'm not the preparation that I'm 

3133
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:34,920
doing.
I would do anyway.

3134
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:39,181
I want to watch their fights because I 
know they're coming up so I'll wash 

3135
02:17:39,181 --> 02:17:40,450
their shit if I need to know about some 
of their training methods,

3136
02:17:40,451 --> 02:17:45,451
but those,
those are things that I will do because 

3137
02:17:45,451 --> 02:17:45,451
I'm curious about.
I want to,

3138
02:17:45,451 --> 02:17:49,570
I want to broaden my understanding of 
what their preparation is that because I

3139
02:17:49,571 --> 02:17:54,571
want to enjoy the fight more and I enjoy
the fight more if I do that and then I 

3140
02:17:54,571 --> 02:17:55,450
expressed that,
but all that stuff is off memory.

3141
02:17:55,450 --> 02:17:56,260
It's there.
Yeah.

3142
02:17:56,261 --> 02:18:01,261
So when I'm doing like how much,
how many notes do you have in front of 

3143
02:18:01,261 --> 02:18:03,781
you that I write zero on one.
So if you hear me talking about old 

3144
02:18:03,781 --> 02:18:07,771
matches and stuff like that,
all that shit is in my head because I 

3145
02:18:07,771 --> 02:18:09,130
have to have good memory and if I really
thought that pot was fucking with that,

3146
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:12,240
I would stop smoking pot but it doesn't 
but it will fuck with like.

3147
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:13,220
Well we just talked about.
Yeah,

3148
02:18:13,221 --> 02:18:18,221
I know that it'll do that.
What do you think twitter is doing that 

3149
02:18:18,221 --> 02:18:18,221
too?
I'm a firm believer in that,

3150
02:18:18,221 --> 02:18:20,020
that all of these things and having this
phone constantly,

3151
02:18:20,260 --> 02:18:23,770
that that's framing.
I mean I'm talking really just splitting

3152
02:18:23,771 --> 02:18:27,220
and disintegrating people's memory and 
especially short term memory.

3153
02:18:27,340 --> 02:18:30,210
I see on my show all the time now.
Anyone will,

3154
02:18:30,250 --> 02:18:35,250
beyond just talking about anything that 
suddenly they forget what they're 

3155
02:18:35,250 --> 02:18:35,250
saying.

3156
02:18:35,250 --> 02:18:35,250
I'm not talking about 70 year old 
people.

3157
02:18:35,250 --> 02:18:36,660
I'm talking about a 30 year old people.
You know,

3158
02:18:36,670 --> 02:18:41,670
there used to be a time if you were 
going to meet a buddy out for are you 

3159
02:18:41,670 --> 02:18:41,670
going to meet a girl for a drink or 
something?

3160
02:18:41,670 --> 02:18:43,170
You're waiting on a corner and she's 
going to be.

3161
02:18:43,400 --> 02:18:45,880
She's five minutes late.
You'd have to stand there and just.

3162
02:18:46,100 --> 02:18:47,050
Yup.
And wait.

3163
02:18:47,110 --> 02:18:52,110
Think about some shit.
Look at the sky and the people watching 

3164
02:18:52,110 --> 02:18:52,420
whatever,
but now you immediately,

3165
02:18:54,070 --> 02:18:59,070
you immediately do it.
You can immediately scroll and see an 

3166
02:18:59,070 --> 02:18:59,070
approval,
approval,

3167
02:18:59,070 --> 02:18:59,260
approval abroad.
They loved me,

3168
02:18:59,261 --> 02:19:00,070
they love me,
they hate me,

3169
02:19:00,071 --> 02:19:02,170
they love me.
Whatever it is and all of that.

3170
02:19:02,560 --> 02:19:07,560
And it goes to what we started with this
whole thing about and six second videos 

3171
02:19:07,560 --> 02:19:11,220
and all of the shit and this bounce back
of why people like this now is because 

3172
02:19:11,220 --> 02:19:15,391
all of this I really think is they've 
done studies where it's actually 

3173
02:19:15,391 --> 02:19:18,520
rewiring synopsis and all of this stuff.
It's changing people's brains,

3174
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:21,250
uh,
and that the Internet is actually having

3175
02:19:21,251 --> 02:19:26,251
a physical effect on us that's not just 
starting next or hungover and done neck 

3176
02:19:26,251 --> 02:19:28,010
thing is real man.
They're worried that

3177
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:33,010
people are gonna like older people of 
our generation and before or are going 

3178
02:19:33,010 --> 02:19:35,000
to have real issues with their neck 
because they're always looking down.

3179
02:19:35,350 --> 02:19:40,350
And that in looking down like that 
you're stretching the ligaments and 

3180
02:19:40,350 --> 02:19:41,780
stretching your neck and putting 
pressure on your discs.

3181
02:19:43,170 --> 02:19:46,960
Even when I'm holding my ipad I feel 
like I've done something to my pinky.

3182
02:19:47,310 --> 02:19:48,700
Pinky has like,
I'm not kidding,

3183
02:19:48,701 --> 02:19:53,701
like I've got like two little 
indentations here because I'm holding 

3184
02:19:53,701 --> 02:19:53,701
this thing all the time like this,
you know,

3185
02:19:53,701 --> 02:19:56,030
I mean really people,
you do all kinds of weird shit.

3186
02:19:56,060 --> 02:19:57,340
How if you're writing,
I'm a lefty.

3187
02:19:57,341 --> 02:20:02,341
So like if I'm writing like I have a 
little indentation on my index finger 

3188
02:20:02,341 --> 02:20:06,361
because the power is always in there,
like you actually can physically change 

3189
02:20:06,361 --> 02:20:06,670
your body by

3190
02:20:06,890 --> 02:20:10,300
some of this technological 
unquestionable.

3191
02:20:10,490 --> 02:20:13,550
I used to have a from writing from 
drawing.

3192
02:20:13,580 --> 02:20:15,970
I used to have a big callus on the 
inside of my fuck.

3193
02:20:15,971 --> 02:20:19,060
You finger on my right a little extra.
Well it was not,

3194
02:20:19,070 --> 02:20:20,680
it was not that,
but I mean it's just from.

3195
02:20:20,710 --> 02:20:25,710
I drew like hours and hours every day 
when I was young and I always had these 

3196
02:20:25,710 --> 02:20:27,170
big calluses all over there and they've 
all gone away.

3197
02:20:27,171 --> 02:20:29,120
Now.
It's interesting how that happens.

3198
02:20:29,150 --> 02:20:30,230
But to start drawing again.
Yeah,

3199
02:20:30,231 --> 02:20:32,120
maybe.
But the neck thing is a real,

3200
02:20:32,180 --> 02:20:33,140
real concern.
The,

3201
02:20:33,141 --> 02:20:37,160
I think it's gotten me,
I mean obviously your eyes degenerate as

3202
02:20:37,161 --> 02:20:39,740
you get older.
That's the thing about close vision.

3203
02:20:39,741 --> 02:20:44,741
But with me,
I think it's got to be connected at 

3204
02:20:44,741 --> 02:20:47,351
least somewhat to staring at screens.
I know that's bad for your focusing on 

3205
02:20:47,351 --> 02:20:51,791
any short term,
like something that's really close to 

3206
02:20:51,791 --> 02:20:51,791
you.

3207
02:20:51,791 --> 02:20:53,630
And who the fuck was it?
That was on the podcast that referred to

3208
02:20:53,631 --> 02:20:56,540
it as like a cast.
I don't remember who it was.

3209
02:20:57,080 --> 02:21:00,380
Oh,
it was a short term memory.

3210
02:21:00,381 --> 02:21:01,170
Come on.
Who is,

3211
02:21:02,300 --> 02:21:04,670
who sleeps on the ground?
Remember the chick who,

3212
02:21:04,671 --> 02:21:09,671
uh,
she doesn't sleep on beds and she's got 

3213
02:21:09,671 --> 02:21:09,710
this interesting.
Cathy is her name.

3214
02:21:09,720 --> 02:21:11,260
Cathy.
Um,

3215
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:13,490
what Jamie,
you'll find it.

3216
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:18,700
But anyway,
the way she described it as she was 

3217
02:21:18,700 --> 02:21:18,700
saying that when you're staring Kathy 
Bowman.

3218
02:21:18,990 --> 02:21:19,850
Yep.
Yeah.

3219
02:21:20,150 --> 02:21:21,140
Katy Bowman.
Thank you.

3220
02:21:21,170 --> 02:21:26,170
Katy Bowman.
She that she said when you were staring 

3221
02:21:26,170 --> 02:21:28,601
at one distance all the time,
just treating your face and your laptop 

3222
02:21:28,601 --> 02:21:31,870
or your face in your phone is that your 
eyes are supposed to look at clothes,

3223
02:21:31,880 --> 02:21:36,880
things and far things and look at this 
broad range of distances and instead 

3224
02:21:37,730 --> 02:21:42,730
you're only looking at something right 
in front of your face and it fucks with 

3225
02:21:42,730 --> 02:21:44,620
literally shape of your eye.
And then it's your,

3226
02:21:44,621 --> 02:21:49,621
your,
your body doesn't know what the fuck to 

3227
02:21:49,621 --> 02:21:49,621
do.

3228
02:21:49,621 --> 02:21:49,621
I mean,
think about it.

3229
02:21:49,621 --> 02:21:51,810
Our grandparents or even our parents.
Well,

3230
02:21:51,811 --> 02:21:54,600
my dad was born.
There was no such thing as television.

3231
02:21:55,170 --> 02:21:57,110
I'm 39 years old.
That's insane,

3232
02:21:57,111 --> 02:22:02,111
right?
So our grandparents had no screens that 

3233
02:22:02,111 --> 02:22:02,111
didn't even have radio,
right.

3234
02:22:02,111 --> 02:22:03,390
Radio just maybe started,
whatever.

3235
02:22:03,391 --> 02:22:05,040
It wasn't a window radio started giving 
you.

3236
02:22:06,440 --> 02:22:06,840
Right.
Okay.

3237
02:22:06,841 --> 02:22:10,770
So my grandparents were wars.
Is that 19 twenties?

3238
02:22:10,850 --> 02:22:12,930
Yeah.
So I mean really think about that,

3239
02:22:12,931 --> 02:22:16,290
how we've changed 100 years and as you 
were talking about earlier about how the

3240
02:22:16,291 --> 02:22:21,291
Internet's going to change us and we're 
learning so much more faster and all 

3241
02:22:21,291 --> 02:22:24,411
that,
but now it's so involved in this 

3242
02:22:24,411 --> 02:22:24,411
digital.
I mean it's,

3243
02:22:24,411 --> 02:22:27,831
the matrix is becoming real.
Ultimately we're just the batteries for 

3244
02:22:27,831 --> 02:22:30,120
these things to keep going,
you know,

3245
02:22:30,121 --> 02:22:35,040
like they were just putting information.
We're putting whatever our spirit is,

3246
02:22:35,041 --> 02:22:40,041
whatever,
whatever you want to call that is just 

3247
02:22:40,041 --> 02:22:41,160
the battery for this digital thing to 
exist.

3248
02:22:41,250 --> 02:22:44,220
Do you know who Marshall Mcluhan says?
I don't think so.

3249
02:22:44,530 --> 02:22:48,220
Fascinating thinker,
an author from the fifties and sixties,

3250
02:22:48,221 --> 02:22:49,540
I think it was,
and he,

3251
02:22:49,860 --> 02:22:54,860
he was a part of a.
It was a part of the counterculture and 

3252
02:22:54,860 --> 02:22:55,000
a lot of ways a lot of people quote 
them,

3253
02:22:55,001 --> 02:22:59,260
but one of the things that he said about
this is technology before computers,

3254
02:22:59,650 --> 02:23:04,650
he said human beings are the sex organs 
for the machine world and the idea that 

3255
02:23:04,650 --> 02:23:09,571
we exist to create these machines and I 
firmly believe that what we're doing is 

3256
02:23:11,411 --> 02:23:16,411
we are some sort of a technological 
caterpillar and we're giving birth to a 

3257
02:23:16,411 --> 02:23:17,140
new life form.
I really,

3258
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:22,200
really believed that and I think that 
Elon Musk and what he said about 

3259
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:23,740
summoning the demon in the form of 
artificial intelligence,

3260
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:27,130
I don't think that's off at all.
I think there's gonna come a time,

3261
02:23:27,131 --> 02:23:29,110
whether it's 100 years or a thousand 
years,

3262
02:23:29,720 --> 02:23:34,720
human life and this biological,
the biological limitations of our own 

3263
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:36,820
cellular bodies.
It's going to be ridiculous.

3264
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:37,690
We're,
we're gonna.

3265
02:23:38,080 --> 02:23:39,280
We're just gonna.
Get rid of them.

3266
02:23:39,310 --> 02:23:40,150
Yeah.
I mean,

3267
02:23:40,151 --> 02:23:42,950
I don't think it's gonna be that long.
100 or if I forget if that was,

3268
02:23:42,990 --> 02:23:47,990
that was,
we're going to be long gone from this 

3269
02:23:47,990 --> 02:23:49,770
earth.
I don't even think people won't be 

3270
02:23:49,770 --> 02:23:49,770
around a thousand years.
Uh,

3271
02:23:49,770 --> 02:23:50,320
I think we'll have,
I think,

3272
02:23:50,321 --> 02:23:55,321
no,
I think a lot of people are probably 

3273
02:23:55,321 --> 02:23:55,321
going to die here on our dying planet 
and you know,

3274
02:23:55,321 --> 02:23:58,350
rich people mainly are going to be able 
to escape with spaceships.

3275
02:23:58,380 --> 02:23:59,800
Yeah.
We're going to go to.

3276
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:01,900
Are we going?
We're going to lie.

3277
02:24:01,901 --> 02:24:03,880
I guess we've given up on the moon right
now.

3278
02:24:04,130 --> 02:24:05,200
We're going to,
but we're going to go.

3279
02:24:05,201 --> 02:24:10,201
We're going to find something.
We're going to find something that has 

3280
02:24:10,201 --> 02:24:11,950
some of the basic building blocks of 
life like earth,

3281
02:24:12,520 --> 02:24:13,420
you know,
look,

3282
02:24:13,590 --> 02:24:14,830
you know Carl Sagan,
our,

3283
02:24:14,831 --> 02:24:19,831
our,
our son is not spectacular by any 

3284
02:24:19,831 --> 02:24:22,831
stretch and we know that there's 
billions and billions of sons in this 

3285
02:24:22,831 --> 02:24:22,831
galaxy and this university,
you know,

3286
02:24:22,831 --> 02:24:27,481
that whole thing and it endlessly 
extrapolates and all we are just a tiny 

3287
02:24:27,481 --> 02:24:31,861
rock with that had the right distance 
from the sun and the right amount of 

3288
02:24:31,861 --> 02:24:35,551
chemicals to make all this shit happen.
We're going to find something that's 

3289
02:24:35,551 --> 02:24:35,710
going to be similar to this,
but maybe it'll,

3290
02:24:35,740 --> 02:24:37,720
it'll all be 10 degrees hotter.
And because of that,

3291
02:24:37,721 --> 02:24:40,060
everything will have evolved slightly 
differently.

3292
02:24:40,180 --> 02:24:43,060
Or maybe you know,
you could pick like I love star wars,

3293
02:24:43,061 --> 02:24:44,770
you can pick any of those planets,
you know,

3294
02:24:45,370 --> 02:24:50,370
it just evolved differently.
There'll be a planet that's know mostly 

3295
02:24:50,370 --> 02:24:53,341
water and will have to eventually learn 
how to deal with that unless the guys 

3296
02:24:53,341 --> 02:24:55,050
get here first and kill us,
but possible to that is possible

3297
02:24:55,070 --> 02:25:00,070
spoke.
But I think that our own biological 

3298
02:25:00,070 --> 02:25:02,531
limitations are on organisms are so 
acutely adapted to this environment,

3299
02:25:02,780 --> 02:25:07,780
the environment of planet earth that it 
would be insanely difficult for us to 

3300
02:25:09,051 --> 02:25:14,051
colonize another planet and insanely,
insanely problematic when it comes to 

3301
02:25:15,201 --> 02:25:20,201
dealing with whatever life has already.
They're dealing with the environment 

3302
02:25:20,201 --> 02:25:21,740
dealing with that.
It'd be better to just fix this spot.

3303
02:25:22,150 --> 02:25:24,940
Well,
I hope we fucking falling apart.

3304
02:25:25,090 --> 02:25:28,330
Like we're like,
we have a shitty old car and we're like,

3305
02:25:28,360 --> 02:25:33,360
let's just abandon it and leave it on 
the lawn and move to the neighbor's 

3306
02:25:33,360 --> 02:25:33,790
house.
I mean that's really the idea,

3307
02:25:33,791 --> 02:25:38,791
but the neighbor's house is on fire all 
the time and it gets pelted with 

3308
02:25:38,791 --> 02:25:42,331
asteroids.
I think we're going to put all of our 

3309
02:25:42,331 --> 02:25:44,281
effort into flying to some other planet 
and on the way there their son's going 

3310
02:25:44,281 --> 02:25:47,521
to Supernova and then we're going to 
blow up in the middle of space and I'll 

3311
02:25:47,521 --> 02:25:51,001
hope will be lost.
That's what I think people have been 

3312
02:25:51,001 --> 02:25:52,440
inspired by this conversation and now 
you've people back here on earth.

3313
02:25:52,441 --> 02:25:53,860
We're just going to regroup and go,
you know what?

3314
02:25:53,950 --> 02:25:56,950
Let's stop trying to go to space and 
just clean the ocean.

3315
02:25:57,370 --> 02:25:57,760
Yeah.

3316
02:25:58,180 --> 02:26:01,450
I really think are something about 
humans.

3317
02:26:01,960 --> 02:26:04,810
Something about look right now,
like even if we cut,

3318
02:26:05,510 --> 02:26:10,510
and again I'm not a scientist,
we'd even when we cut our greenhouse 

3319
02:26:10,510 --> 02:26:10,510
gases here in America and we do all this
stuff,

3320
02:26:10,510 --> 02:26:12,250
India,
these developing nations,

3321
02:26:12,251 --> 02:26:17,251
China,
they're going through what we went 

3322
02:26:17,251 --> 02:26:19,291
through 60 years ago.
So when we have the UN meet and try to 

3323
02:26:19,291 --> 02:26:22,621
get everybody to come up with numbers 
that we're going to allow to put out 

3324
02:26:22,621 --> 02:26:23,980
this much smog and this much.
All this bullshit.

3325
02:26:24,850 --> 02:26:29,850
It's like,
what right do we have to tell them not 

3326
02:26:29,850 --> 02:26:32,020
to do everything they can to advance 
just the way we did 50 years ago.

3327
02:26:32,200 --> 02:26:32,550
So.
No.

3328
02:26:32,650 --> 02:26:34,150
So it's funny and I live in West 
Hollywood.

3329
02:26:34,151 --> 02:26:35,410
There are no plastic bags.
Right.

3330
02:26:35,411 --> 02:26:37,720
And they don't even want to give me a 
paper bag at trader Joe's anymore.

3331
02:26:37,780 --> 02:26:38,940
You know,
you have to pay for it,

3332
02:26:38,941 --> 02:26:40,050
you have to pay for it.
And that's.

3333
02:26:40,060 --> 02:26:42,160
I mostly just pay for paper bags at this
point.

3334
02:26:42,430 --> 02:26:44,440
They hate me too because I never bring 
my own bag.

3335
02:26:44,441 --> 02:26:46,790
I'm a fucking bad ass.
I pay that ten cents for that.

3336
02:26:47,010 --> 02:26:49,030
They hate you for that.
Yeah,

3337
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:49,960
you can see it.
The judge,

3338
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:52,100
the horrible judge.
I need those paper bags.

3339
02:26:52,610 --> 02:26:55,050
I use the paper bags.
Recycling in them.

3340
02:26:55,080 --> 02:26:57,260
Yeah.
Well that's also how I light the fire.

3341
02:26:57,261 --> 02:27:02,261
When I use my grill,
I stuffed the paper bag underneath the 

3342
02:27:02,261 --> 02:27:02,990
little charcoal chimney I use.
Yeah.

3343
02:27:03,050 --> 02:27:05,230
Well they'd hate you for that.
Oh fuck them.

3344
02:27:06,630 --> 02:27:07,670
Short sided bitches.

3345
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:08,680
Yeah.
Anyway,

3346
02:27:08,690 --> 02:27:09,950
the.
I just think the,

3347
02:27:09,951 --> 02:27:11,810
the earth.
I Dunno,

3348
02:27:12,110 --> 02:27:17,110
I dunno.
I think 100 years they'd be hard for me 

3349
02:27:17,110 --> 02:27:17,110
to believe that things could still be 
going on around here.

3350
02:27:17,110 --> 02:27:17,710
Well,
100 years ago,

3351
02:27:17,711 --> 02:27:19,780
you'd be amazed at what progress has 
taken place.

3352
02:27:19,781 --> 02:27:21,430
Socially.
You'd be amazed.

3353
02:27:21,431 --> 02:27:22,570
I mean,
think about that.

3354
02:27:22,840 --> 02:27:26,500
Think about 18,
65 was the last time slavery was legal,

3355
02:27:26,501 --> 02:27:27,970
right?
Think of that.

3356
02:27:28,180 --> 02:27:30,790
I think that's an awful long time.
Long time ago now.

3357
02:27:30,820 --> 02:27:33,520
That's almost 100 years.
Exactly.

3358
02:27:33,521 --> 02:27:36,160
From when I was born.
I was born in [inaudible] 67,

3359
02:27:36,370 --> 02:27:39,740
so 102 years later I was born after 
sleep,

3360
02:27:39,741 --> 02:27:42,670
but that's nothing.
A 100 years is not that much time.

3361
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:48,000
I think that a thousand years from now 
who the fuck knows what kind of 

3362
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:52,170
technological capabilities we're going 
to have as far as our ability to not 

3363
02:27:52,170 --> 02:27:55,750
just not create waste,
but to use up all the waste that we have

3364
02:27:55,751 --> 02:28:00,040
created and use it in a positive way.
Just because you burn gasoline,

3365
02:28:00,041 --> 02:28:05,041
it creates pollution.
It doesn't mean that's the only way you 

3366
02:28:05,041 --> 02:28:05,980
can get energy and just because 
pollution is in the air,

3367
02:28:05,981 --> 02:28:09,740
carbon dioxide is hitting record levels.
It doesn't mean that can't be maintained

3368
02:28:09,741 --> 02:28:14,741
and regulated.
I think there's gotta be a way that 

3369
02:28:14,741 --> 02:28:17,041
people can figure out how to live 
sustainably if it's possible to live 

3370
02:28:17,041 --> 02:28:21,271
sustainably in a small community.
It's possible to live sustainably 

3371
02:28:21,271 --> 02:28:21,920
globally,
so when you do it for yourself,

3372
02:28:21,921 --> 02:28:22,070
like

3373
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:24,280
when you hunt for your meat and you were
Tommy,

3374
02:28:24,300 --> 02:28:25,250
have chickens before.
When you.

3375
02:28:25,251 --> 02:28:30,251
When you do all that stuff,
do you feel that you're doing it for 

3376
02:28:30,251 --> 02:28:32,330
yourself or you're doing it for your 
community or is it 50 slash 50

3377
02:28:32,400 --> 02:28:36,150
zero and be totally honest?
Zero for my community,

3378
02:28:36,151 --> 02:28:39,060
zero for the earth.
I'm just thinking what's the best way?

3379
02:28:39,260 --> 02:28:41,340
This is just my,
my intent going in.

3380
02:28:41,341 --> 02:28:42,840
I understand that it's better for the 
earth,

3381
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:48,200
but my intent going in is like I don't 
want to rely on other people for my 

3382
02:28:48,200 --> 02:28:52,521
food.
I don't want to rely on some farmer to 

3383
02:28:52,521 --> 02:28:54,540
not shove antibiotics and hormones and 
the food.

3384
02:28:54,990 --> 02:28:56,910
I want to be able to eat clean,
healthy food.

3385
02:28:56,911 --> 02:28:58,140
Also,
ethically,

3386
02:28:58,410 --> 02:29:01,170
I don't want to be a part of the factory
farming system.

3387
02:29:01,171 --> 02:29:04,200
I think when I watch these youtube 
videos,

3388
02:29:04,201 --> 02:29:09,201
he's peta videos on how they raised pigs
and cows and it's fucking evil.

3389
02:29:09,391 --> 02:29:11,730
I'd rather shoot a wild pig.
I'd rather.

3390
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:13,540
I'd rather eat moose,
you know,

3391
02:29:13,560 --> 02:29:16,020
I think it's better for you to the 
protein wise,

3392
02:29:16,021 --> 02:29:21,021
the protein content of elk and Moose is 
far higher than the protein content of 

3393
02:29:21,021 --> 02:29:21,210
beef.
It's better for you.

3394
02:29:21,211 --> 02:29:23,370
You can eat smaller portions.
You get more out of it.

3395
02:29:23,910 --> 02:29:25,710
I just,
for me,

3396
02:29:26,080 --> 02:29:30,120
it gives me a better feeling.
I know where everything came from when I

3397
02:29:30,121 --> 02:29:34,050
eat a steak that I cut from an elk 
myself.

3398
02:29:34,440 --> 02:29:39,440
That is such a different feeling than 
when you go to the supermarket and you 

3399
02:29:39,440 --> 02:29:43,521
get something of ambiguous origins and 
plastic wrapped container and just take 

3400
02:29:43,521 --> 02:29:45,720
it home and cut open a plastic and slap 
it on the grill and.

3401
02:29:45,730 --> 02:29:48,000
Or I'm out here growing locker man.
So you know

3402
02:29:48,310 --> 02:29:52,300
trader Joe's that when you get just 
chopped me from trader Joe's,

3403
02:29:52,330 --> 02:29:57,330
it comes from four different countries.
They have four countries of origin on 

3404
02:29:57,491 --> 02:29:58,270
it.
For beef,

3405
02:29:58,330 --> 02:30:00,310
for beef,
go right now.

3406
02:30:00,520 --> 02:30:01,860
Countries.
Yeah.

3407
02:30:01,870 --> 02:30:03,220
You could go.
Maybe we can google it,

3408
02:30:03,290 --> 02:30:05,290
the that it,
it's coming from,

3409
02:30:05,340 --> 02:30:06,330
you know,
United States,

3410
02:30:06,340 --> 02:30:07,840
something like the United States,
Canada,

3411
02:30:07,841 --> 02:30:12,841
Mexico,
and then like something that we're not 

3412
02:30:12,841 --> 02:30:13,420
even geographically connected to and 
then I guess they package it all here.

3413
02:30:13,810 --> 02:30:18,810
But think about that like,
you know how we're so disconnected from 

3414
02:30:18,810 --> 02:30:22,270
our food that when you eat a freaking 
burger from trader Joe's,

3415
02:30:22,500 --> 02:30:24,940
it came from for country.
I'm not making this up.

3416
02:30:24,941 --> 02:30:25,200
We,

3417
02:30:25,580 --> 02:30:26,470
I believe you.
I didn't think.

3418
02:30:26,510 --> 02:30:31,510
I wouldn't think you were making it up,
but I shouldn't say I'm surprised 

3419
02:30:31,510 --> 02:30:31,850
because if it's cheaper to do it that 
way,

3420
02:30:31,851 --> 02:30:36,851
that's how they're going to do it.
In trader Joe's is known for having 

3421
02:30:36,851 --> 02:30:40,590
fairly inexpensive food.
Shouldn't say cheap because it's all 

3422
02:30:40,590 --> 02:30:41,030
good,
but like whole foods,

3423
02:30:41,031 --> 02:30:42,400
one of the things that are like about 
whole foods,

3424
02:30:42,430 --> 02:30:44,540
people say whole foods is expensive.
It is expensive,

3425
02:30:44,650 --> 02:30:47,510
expensive,
but they'll show you like the farm where

3426
02:30:47,511 --> 02:30:50,960
the beef is being grown and you can 
choose how you want it.

3427
02:30:50,961 --> 02:30:54,590
Like you can choose,
like I did a bordain show the other day.

3428
02:30:54,591 --> 02:30:59,591
We're,
we're hunting pheasants in Montana for 

3429
02:30:59,591 --> 02:31:01,160
an upcoming episode and we were talking 
about steak and he was like,

3430
02:31:01,161 --> 02:31:02,690
you know what I mean?
Everybody says,

3431
02:31:02,691 --> 02:31:03,800
Oh,
you have to have grass fed,

3432
02:31:03,801 --> 02:31:04,430
grass fed.
He goes,

3433
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:06,740
I like a fatty steak.
He goes,

3434
02:31:06,741 --> 02:31:07,750
I like steak.
That's a.

3435
02:31:07,770 --> 02:31:12,770
That eats corn I think.
I think it tastes better and a lot of 

3436
02:31:12,770 --> 02:31:13,190
ways,
but they give you options.

3437
02:31:13,550 --> 02:31:18,550
They give you.
That whole tiered system shows you 

3438
02:31:18,550 --> 02:31:18,550
exactly where the meat is coming from,
how it's.

3439
02:31:18,550 --> 02:31:20,280
There's a fucking photo of the farm,

3440
02:31:20,460 --> 02:31:23,310
like they show you the farm where these 
things are being raised in,

3441
02:31:23,320 --> 02:31:28,320
in.
It's more expensive to eat sustainable 

3442
02:31:28,320 --> 02:31:28,320
food.
It is.

3443
02:31:28,320 --> 02:31:29,670
It's more expensive.
These hunts that I go on doesn't cheap.

3444
02:31:30,780 --> 02:31:33,510
The effort is way more.
I mean if I,

3445
02:31:33,511 --> 02:31:38,511
if I shoot an elk,
it's gonna take me five or six days to 

3446
02:31:38,511 --> 02:31:43,011
put it all together to get one and then 
you have to process to mean Carey and 

3447
02:31:43,011 --> 02:31:43,890
freeze it.
And do you do all of that or do you have

3448
02:31:43,891 --> 02:31:45,270
people?
I assume you have somebody helping you.

3449
02:31:45,271 --> 02:31:48,370
It depends on.
Some of them have done all of it on,

3450
02:31:48,500 --> 02:31:49,860
on,
on other ones.

3451
02:31:49,861 --> 02:31:51,480
If I'm traveling,
I'm flying.

3452
02:31:51,481 --> 02:31:55,410
What I can do is do a lot of it and then
bring the remaining pieces,

3453
02:31:55,411 --> 02:32:00,411
a quarter it and bring the quarters to a
meat processor and ask them to turn it 

3454
02:32:00,501 --> 02:32:03,930
into steaks or turning into sausage or 
have things like that done.

3455
02:32:03,930 --> 02:32:08,700
But the big cuts like the back straps 
and the tenderloins and stuff like that.

3456
02:32:08,701 --> 02:32:10,350
I do all that myself.
The heart and the liver.

3457
02:32:10,500 --> 02:32:13,260
I cut all that stuff out myself and then
I bring it with me.

3458
02:32:13,261 --> 02:32:18,261
I freeze it and you know,
if you want to see how crazy the food 

3459
02:32:18,261 --> 02:32:18,261
system is.
Also you could check,

3460
02:32:18,261 --> 02:32:19,230
you know,
there's so many documentaries on this,

3461
02:32:19,231 --> 02:32:24,231
but the amount of laws that we have that
protect the factory farming from simple 

3462
02:32:24,301 --> 02:32:28,830
things like having cameras in where the 
chickens are illegal,

3463
02:32:29,110 --> 02:32:34,110
things that purdue is getting away with.
I always think purdue to me is like the 

3464
02:32:34,110 --> 02:32:36,210
worst of the worst because if you watch 
their commercials,

3465
02:32:36,211 --> 02:32:37,540
and this goes to what we were talking 
about with the,

3466
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:42,560
with the drugs and the happy people 
during the day and then they're having 

3467
02:32:42,560 --> 02:32:42,600
diarrhea and killing each other,
whatever,

3468
02:32:42,820 --> 02:32:43,510
like the,
the,

3469
02:32:43,600 --> 02:32:44,880
the purdue commercials.

3470
02:32:45,090 --> 02:32:47,730
You've got this guy come out,
he's hanging out with chickens,

3471
02:32:47,731 --> 02:32:48,750
you know,
he's talking to them.

3472
02:32:48,751 --> 02:32:51,030
Oh there is Bernadette.
And did they still have.

3473
02:32:51,300 --> 02:32:53,220
They still do all that stupid shit he 
was.

3474
02:32:53,221 --> 02:32:55,890
Or sometimes it's a cartoon and he walks
in the morning.

3475
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:57,840
What he doesn't say is that he just,
he's about,

3476
02:32:57,990 --> 02:33:02,990
you know,
it's like a Holocaust is going on in 

3477
02:33:02,990 --> 02:33:04,701
there.
He's killing all the chickens and he's 

3478
02:33:04,701 --> 02:33:06,051
going to kill them,
but we have somehow like that's how 

3479
02:33:06,051 --> 02:33:09,471
marketing is so crazy.
We don't let cameras in to watch them 

3480
02:33:09,471 --> 02:33:13,170
rip the beaks off and not let them in.
It's illegal.

3481
02:33:13,860 --> 02:33:15,510
So think about that and can get 
arrested.

3482
02:33:15,540 --> 02:33:18,030
What does that have to do?
Why would the government,

3483
02:33:18,050 --> 02:33:22,320
why would our government that's supposed
to have our best interests at heart?

3484
02:33:22,350 --> 02:33:27,350
Right.
I guess that's the government supposed 

3485
02:33:27,350 --> 02:33:27,350
to have a.
Why would they pass that kind of law?

3486
02:33:27,350 --> 02:33:28,620
A lot of money to be made.
Exactly.

3487
02:33:28,621 --> 02:33:32,640
If you want to go to General Motors and 
you want to film them putting together a

3488
02:33:32,641 --> 02:33:34,980
Camaro,
of course love it.

3489
02:33:35,480 --> 02:33:38,550
They look at what the tour is,
how we do it,

3490
02:33:38,910 --> 02:33:43,910
why?
Because no fucking babies are getting 

3491
02:33:43,910 --> 02:33:46,221
crushed other making Camaro's,
but if you want to go to a pig farm and 

3492
02:33:46,221 --> 02:33:47,280
film it,
you can go to jail.

3493
02:33:47,490 --> 02:33:52,490
Like these are new laws that have been 
passed because of whistleblowers and 

3494
02:33:52,490 --> 02:33:53,910
those laws are evil.
That's evil.

3495
02:33:54,140 --> 02:33:56,010
I mean that should be transparent.
One hundred percent.

3496
02:33:56,011 --> 02:33:58,620
You should be able to know exactly where
your food is coming from.

3497
02:33:58,621 --> 02:34:00,390
There's only one way to do that.
Yeah.

3498
02:34:00,450 --> 02:34:04,530
I mean we've done so many things between
feeding these animals,

3499
02:34:04,560 --> 02:34:07,110
all sorts of shit that they shouldn't be
eating.

3500
02:34:07,350 --> 02:34:08,490
Have you ever drove,
drove up?

3501
02:34:08,491 --> 02:34:13,491
I think it's a five.
If you're driving up towards San 

3502
02:34:13,491 --> 02:34:13,491
Francisco.

3503
02:34:13,491 --> 02:34:13,980
He passed Harris ranch,
Harris ranch.

3504
02:34:13,981 --> 02:34:16,530
I think if I'm not mistaken,
it's the largest.

3505
02:34:17,080 --> 02:34:22,080
A meat producer in the United States are
the largest meat producing ranch in the 

3506
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:23,320
United States,
and when you pass it,

3507
02:34:23,350 --> 02:34:24,790
they call it cow shit.
I mean,

3508
02:34:24,791 --> 02:34:28,390
that's how there is so much.
It stinks of death.

3509
02:34:28,420 --> 02:34:29,740
I mean pure death,
right?

3510
02:34:29,750 --> 02:34:31,930
You've smelled that for a good mile or 
two.

3511
02:34:32,380 --> 02:34:37,380
You can see it in the air.
You see these dirty animals that can 

3512
02:34:37,380 --> 02:34:38,080
barely move.
I mean,

3513
02:34:38,081 --> 02:34:42,460
I love meat on my twitter from last 
night I had grass fed steaks cooked on a

3514
02:34:42,461 --> 02:34:45,520
whole Himalayan salt plate.
I love me.

3515
02:34:45,700 --> 02:34:48,370
Right?
But after that I was like,

3516
02:34:48,430 --> 02:34:50,170
Jesus,
like this is serious.

3517
02:34:50,360 --> 02:34:53,980
That's when I got on at least doing the 
grass fed free range thing.

3518
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:54,740
Well,
this is like,

3519
02:34:54,741 --> 02:34:57,070
I can't be part of this,
but I know it's about money.

3520
02:34:57,220 --> 02:34:58,810
Well,
it's not just about money.

3521
02:34:58,810 --> 02:35:03,810
It's about volume.
Like when you have a community of 20 

3522
02:35:03,810 --> 02:35:05,550
million people across Los Angeles and 
none of them are growing their own food.

3523
02:35:05,551 --> 02:35:10,551
Yeah,
they're going to need food and where's 

3524
02:35:10,551 --> 02:35:11,970
that food going to come from?
It's going to come from somebody else 

3525
02:35:11,970 --> 02:35:11,970
that grows up food and we'll how they're
going to grow that food.

3526
02:35:11,970 --> 02:35:16,200
They're going to grow that food in the 
most cost effective and efficient way 

3527
02:35:16,200 --> 02:35:16,650
possible,
which means stuff.

3528
02:35:16,651 --> 02:35:21,651
These fucking animals into these cages.
Unless you demand something different 

3529
02:35:21,651 --> 02:35:22,150
and well,
if you do demand something different,

3530
02:35:22,151 --> 02:35:27,151
you're going to have a higher price 
because then these companies aren't 

3531
02:35:27,151 --> 02:35:29,671
going to be making much money,
so they're going to have to charge more 

3532
02:35:29,671 --> 02:35:29,671
money for the meat and then people can 
afford it and then it becomes a problem.

3533
02:35:29,671 --> 02:35:32,410
But if you wanna be able to go to in and
out burger or in and out.

3534
02:35:32,410 --> 02:35:34,120
It's not a good example because it takes
a little time,

3535
02:35:34,330 --> 02:35:36,070
but like Jack in the box,
pull in,

3536
02:35:36,430 --> 02:35:41,430
get up,
ground up beef sandwich within 30 

3537
02:35:41,430 --> 02:35:41,430
seconds.
Yeah,

3538
02:35:41,620 --> 02:35:43,210
look,
there's only one way to do that.

3539
02:35:43,490 --> 02:35:46,030
You know,
you got to do it with a massive factory.

3540
02:35:46,210 --> 02:35:48,070
You have to be churning these fuckers 
out,

3541
02:35:48,220 --> 02:35:51,180
hanging above their ankles and putting 
pest piston,

3542
02:35:51,460 --> 02:35:54,250
you know,
through their brain every 30 seconds.

3543
02:35:54,251 --> 02:35:55,660
I mean that's.
That's got to be chunk,

3544
02:35:55,690 --> 02:35:56,290
chunk,
chunk,

3545
02:35:56,350 --> 02:35:58,660
chunk.
You got to be constantly wiping them out

3546
02:35:58,661 --> 02:36:00,040
because there's so many people that are 
hungry.

3547
02:36:00,400 --> 02:36:02,200
How do you think we get people to wake 
up on this?

3548
02:36:02,201 --> 02:36:03,340
Because what we did,
we covered.

3549
02:36:03,341 --> 02:36:08,341
We covered on my show.
Sometimes it's one of the things that I 

3550
02:36:08,341 --> 02:36:08,500
bring on camera to talk about our food 
sources and the way that these,

3551
02:36:08,620 --> 02:36:10,720
you know,
you were eating sick animals and then we

3552
02:36:10,721 --> 02:36:11,710
wonder why we're sick.

3553
02:36:11,710 --> 02:36:13,870
Like it's all.
Of course it's all connected.

3554
02:36:13,871 --> 02:36:15,490
You open up a thing of meat and it's 
great.

3555
02:36:15,491 --> 02:36:17,660
Why is it great?
Why would you put that in your.

3556
02:36:18,370 --> 02:36:21,040
Why would you put that in your body?
But this is one of those things.

3557
02:36:21,041 --> 02:36:26,041
It's like our,
the level of our discourse in America 

3558
02:36:26,041 --> 02:36:30,001
and the level of the nonsense on cable 
news and they can keep us distracted 

3559
02:36:30,190 --> 02:36:35,190
with Kim Davis issues and they can't 
keep us distracted with all of this 

3560
02:36:35,190 --> 02:36:38,941
nonsense and I don't think it's 
necessarily like some big conspiracy of 

3561
02:36:38,941 --> 02:36:43,171
keeping us distracted as much as it's 
what we are as humans is this endless 

3562
02:36:44,141 --> 02:36:49,141
distraction.
There's just this endless distraction 

3563
02:36:49,141 --> 02:36:49,141
and you got a pill for some truth out of
it.

3564
02:36:49,141 --> 02:36:52,630
You gotTa Pill for some way to find 
something that works for you,

3565
02:36:52,780 --> 02:36:54,870
so I don't know that they can ever fix 
it because it's.

3566
02:36:55,030 --> 02:37:00,030
We're just in it.
I don't even know if it's an endless 

3567
02:37:00,030 --> 02:37:03,271
distraction.
I think that life has too many 

3568
02:37:03,271 --> 02:37:06,001
variables.
It's almost impossible to consider all 

3569
02:37:06,001 --> 02:37:08,581
the variables,
so you're going to build your own 

3570
02:37:08,581 --> 02:37:09,961
shelter,
you're going to figure out your own 

3571
02:37:09,961 --> 02:37:09,961
electricity,
you're going to run your own wires.

3572
02:37:09,961 --> 02:37:09,961
Are you going to fix your own washing 
machine?

3573
02:37:09,961 --> 02:37:11,440
You're gonna build your own washing 
machine.

3574
02:37:11,740 --> 02:37:13,060
You know what?
Where are you going to get it?

3575
02:37:13,061 --> 02:37:15,160
We're going to get the parts.
Are you going to the metal?

3576
02:37:15,320 --> 02:37:16,310
It's like there's so

3577
02:37:16,310 --> 02:37:21,310
many things involved with living a 
comfortable healthy life in 2015 in the 

3578
02:37:21,310 --> 02:37:25,790
city that you're going to be responsible
for all aspects or just is it just going

3579
02:37:25,791 --> 02:37:28,220
to be food sourcing?
What about sewage?

3580
02:37:28,370 --> 02:37:33,370
What about waste disposal?
What are you going to do about all that 

3581
02:37:33,370 --> 02:37:33,370
stuff?
You're gonna,

3582
02:37:33,370 --> 02:37:33,370
you're gonna.
Look into that or you just going to like

3583
02:37:33,560 --> 02:37:38,560
flush your shit down the toilet and hope
the guy at the other end knows what to 

3584
02:37:38,560 --> 02:37:41,231
do.
That's essentially what it boils down 

3585
02:37:41,231 --> 02:37:42,830
to.
This super complicated civilization that

3586
02:37:42,831 --> 02:37:44,930
has been created.
You can say we've created,

3587
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:50,200
but it's we're,
we're riding on the momentum of the 

3588
02:37:50,200 --> 02:37:52,871
people that came before us and those 
people that came before is oftentimes 

3589
02:37:52,871 --> 02:37:52,871
didn't know what the fuck they were 
doing.

3590
02:37:52,871 --> 02:37:57,610
Didn't plan for the future.
Certainly didn't think that mean when I 

3591
02:37:57,610 --> 02:38:00,851
was a kid in the 19 seventies there was 
like $100,

3592
02:38:02,061 --> 02:38:04,330
million less people in this country 
think.

3593
02:38:04,330 --> 02:38:09,330
Just think about that.
Think about the numbers between like 

3594
02:38:09,330 --> 02:38:11,300
1975 and 2015.
There's more than.

3595
02:38:11,450 --> 02:38:14,680
I think it's more than $100,
million more people just in this kind of

3596
02:38:14,690 --> 02:38:16,610
baby boomers had all those kids.
It's insane.

3597
02:38:16,611 --> 02:38:20,400
And then there's India that's exploding 
population of China.

3598
02:38:20,430 --> 02:38:22,190
Massive population to the point where 
they're,

3599
02:38:22,370 --> 02:38:25,070
they're trying to limit the amount of 
babies that people have.

3600
02:38:25,130 --> 02:38:26,600
I mean,
we live in a very,

3601
02:38:26,601 --> 02:38:31,601
very strange time in that people are 
awakening to all the problems that have 

3602
02:38:32,301 --> 02:38:37,301
been created by this massive amount of 
people and this incredible need for 

3603
02:38:37,301 --> 02:38:42,131
resources,
but at the same time you're working 

3604
02:38:42,131 --> 02:38:44,831
eight hours a day plus plus commuting,
plus hobbies plus sexual needs and 

3605
02:38:47,240 --> 02:38:52,240
entertainment needs and friendships and 
every poll and push and oh well you've 

3606
02:38:53,151 --> 02:38:55,580
got to have civic responsibility.
Guess what,

3607
02:38:55,581 --> 02:38:57,530
Dave Rubin,
we need you for jury duty.

3608
02:38:57,710 --> 02:38:58,610
You can't catch up.

3609
02:38:58,640 --> 02:38:59,980
You can't catch up.
And we,

3610
02:39:00,050 --> 02:39:05,050
we,
we operate on this fucking constant 

3611
02:39:05,050 --> 02:39:07,571
momentum with very little quiet time and
that's things that I love to this thing.

3612
02:39:08,490 --> 02:39:13,490
That's what I loved the most about those
sensory deprivation tank because I get 

3613
02:39:13,490 --> 02:39:15,500
that quiet time that you don't get,
you know,

3614
02:39:15,501 --> 02:39:17,340
I get,
I get time for reflection.

3615
02:39:17,440 --> 02:39:18,950
How often?
How often are you doing it?

3616
02:39:19,020 --> 02:39:20,060
Well,
I have it in my house.

3617
02:39:20,150 --> 02:39:21,740
Oh Man.
So I do it all the time.

3618
02:39:22,400 --> 02:39:23,660
Wow.
That is really cool.

3619
02:39:23,740 --> 02:39:25,850
Yeah,
I think everyone should do it.

3620
02:39:25,851 --> 02:39:30,851
Just to try,
just to feel what it's like to just be 

3621
02:39:30,851 --> 02:39:31,040
alone with your thoughts because it's 
the only time you're actually alone with

3622
02:39:31,041 --> 02:39:33,290
your thoughts because you're not.
Your body isn't even registering.

3623
02:39:33,350 --> 02:39:35,010
Is there a lock on that thing?
No.

3624
02:39:35,030 --> 02:39:37,130
I would be freaking out the entire time.
No,

3625
02:39:38,090 --> 02:39:39,410
I know,
but doesn't make sense,

3626
02:39:39,411 --> 02:39:42,050
but like would there be some reason that
it could lock?

3627
02:39:42,050 --> 02:39:43,020
No.
Yeah.

3628
02:39:43,021 --> 02:39:48,021
I was not even a latch.
There's not even a door handle or 

3629
02:39:48,021 --> 02:39:48,220
anything.
It just pushes open and push his clothes

3630
02:39:48,230 --> 02:39:49,160
got.
How long do you go in there?

3631
02:39:49,161 --> 02:39:50,090
For?
As long as I want.

3632
02:39:50,150 --> 02:39:54,050
Usually at least an hour usually,
but sometimes two hours.

3633
02:39:54,110 --> 02:39:56,690
I know for the first 20 minutes of being
in there,

3634
02:39:56,691 --> 02:39:57,800
I'd be like,
is this thing locked?

3635
02:39:57,860 --> 02:39:59,590
Did I get lost?
Like it would be a lot.

3636
02:39:59,630 --> 02:40:02,240
Even if I was alone,
I would just be fearing.

3637
02:40:02,330 --> 02:40:04,040
That's funny.
You'd get used to it.

3638
02:40:04,160 --> 02:40:05,870
It's like everything else.
It's not scary at all.

3639
02:40:05,871 --> 02:40:07,550
It's relaxing.
What is one of those run yet?

3640
02:40:07,790 --> 02:40:10,760
It's expensive.
A cheap one for like.

3641
02:40:10,790 --> 02:40:15,790
Well,
I think there's a company called Zen 

3642
02:40:15,790 --> 02:40:16,410
float that makes a small personal one 
that Duncan has in his house.

3643
02:40:16,420 --> 02:40:19,260
I think that one is still fairly 
expensive,

3644
02:40:19,261 --> 02:40:23,910
but it's like 1500 bucks.
I got the top of the line.

3645
02:40:23,940 --> 02:40:27,300
Bad Mama Jama float lab version,
which is like 30 grand.

3646
02:40:27,400 --> 02:40:29,160
Wow.
Really expensive.

3647
02:40:29,161 --> 02:40:34,161
But mine is seven feet tall,
nine feet wide and it looks like a meat 

3648
02:40:34,161 --> 02:40:38,121
locker.
It's like it looks like a gigantic 

3649
02:40:38,121 --> 02:40:38,121
freezer that you step into,
but it's perfect.

3650
02:40:38,121 --> 02:40:39,840
I'd like to see the compound that you 
live on.

3651
02:40:39,850 --> 02:40:44,850
I feel like there's a lot of cool 
between the chickens slash and there's 

3652
02:40:44,850 --> 02:40:45,540
elk.
Yeah.

3653
02:40:45,960 --> 02:40:50,960
Yeah.
Before archery range because that's 100 

3654
02:40:50,960 --> 02:40:53,230
yards in my yard.
Rubber pigs and rubber elk and I have an

3655
02:40:53,231 --> 02:40:54,220
ikea couch.
Yeah,

3656
02:40:55,970 --> 02:40:57,580
I built it.
I don't want to.

3657
02:40:57,910 --> 02:40:59,830
I don't want to brag,
but it's an l pretty,

3658
02:41:00,040 --> 02:41:01,950
pretty sweet.
I was reading this thing that was a.

3659
02:41:01,960 --> 02:41:06,960
They were talking about people they 
experience more satisfaction in the 

3660
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:11,851
ownership of things like Ikea because 
even though it's not like good 

3661
02:41:11,851 --> 02:41:13,090
furniture,
it's not like the best furniture.

3662
02:41:13,270 --> 02:41:18,270
The fact that they put it together 
themselves gives them a sense of 

3663
02:41:18,270 --> 02:41:20,470
satisfaction that I think we're kind of 
missing and part of our culture,

3664
02:41:20,630 --> 02:41:25,630
like someone who built their own house 
and built their own furniture and they 

3665
02:41:25,630 --> 02:41:25,690
sit in their own house,
their own furniture probably gets like a

3666
02:41:25,691 --> 02:41:27,970
deep feeling of satisfaction about that.

3667
02:41:28,030 --> 02:41:33,030
Well,
I can tell you as someone that has 

3668
02:41:33,030 --> 02:41:33,030
almost all Ikea,
you know,

3669
02:41:33,030 --> 02:41:33,190
it's funny.
It's taken me.

3670
02:41:33,191 --> 02:41:34,840
I started,
I'm 39.

3671
02:41:34,841 --> 02:41:37,630
I started standing up and right when I 
got out of college,

3672
02:41:37,631 --> 02:41:40,630
Ninety eight had radio shows.
Like it's been a long,

3673
02:41:40,690 --> 02:41:41,800
long journey.
I finally,

3674
02:41:41,801 --> 02:41:46,801
for the first time in this past,
it's really in the past six months and 

3675
02:41:46,801 --> 02:41:50,491
only in the last couple months that I 
really feel like I'm sort of on the 

3676
02:41:50,491 --> 02:41:52,531
other side for the first time and I know
that that feeling never goes away and I 

3677
02:41:52,531 --> 02:41:52,531
probably just jinxed it on your side.
And what went well.

3678
02:41:52,531 --> 02:41:54,560
The other side meaning like I feel like 
I've,

3679
02:41:54,570 --> 02:41:56,790
I'm here somewhere like I'm in the 
career.

3680
02:41:57,830 --> 02:42:01,330
Like I really have something and know 
what I'm saying and know what I'm doing.

3681
02:42:01,570 --> 02:42:06,570
And being rewarded for it financially 
and personally and by my audience and 

3682
02:42:08,171 --> 02:42:08,380
stuff.

3683
02:42:08,500 --> 02:42:10,480
But I'm not rolling in dough by,
by any stretch.

3684
02:42:10,481 --> 02:42:13,420
I'm going to make six figures but like,
but I'm doing good.

3685
02:42:13,490 --> 02:42:14,710
Right.
You're not scared.

3686
02:42:14,830 --> 02:42:15,430
I'm not.
Yeah.

3687
02:42:15,700 --> 02:42:17,050
But the fear,
it's always there.

3688
02:42:17,550 --> 02:42:19,270
The fear factor,
so to speak.

3689
02:42:19,730 --> 02:42:21,830
I think it probably never leaves the 
moon.

3690
02:42:21,870 --> 02:42:24,340
I have a friend of mine who's on a huge 
Sitcom.

3691
02:42:24,790 --> 02:42:27,940
She's making a boat load of money and 
she talks to me about it all the time.

3692
02:42:28,280 --> 02:42:30,510
She's like,
it could be gone tomorrow and then what?

3693
02:42:30,520 --> 02:42:32,170
And then what am I left it.
So I have some money now,

3694
02:42:32,171 --> 02:42:33,100
but like,
you know,

3695
02:42:33,130 --> 02:42:34,840
what am I left with?
Um,

3696
02:42:35,620 --> 02:42:39,760
but I do aspire my,
my house is pretty much 90 percent Ikea.

3697
02:42:40,160 --> 02:42:42,550
Like I want to get to 100.
No,

3698
02:42:42,551 --> 02:42:44,560
I want to get to the point when there's 
no,

3699
02:42:44,561 --> 02:42:48,640
I want to get to 10 percent.
I mean like my couch is Ikea.

3700
02:42:48,641 --> 02:42:50,340
My bed is Ikea,
my futons,

3701
02:42:50,440 --> 02:42:53,830
Ikea.
The Shit in my kitchen is Ikea.

3702
02:42:53,831 --> 02:42:58,831
Like that would be to me success like 
designer furniture.

3703
02:42:59,300 --> 02:43:01,870
But because the ikea couch more than 
anything is,

3704
02:43:01,960 --> 02:43:03,610
is painful.
Not Good.

3705
02:43:03,670 --> 02:43:04,540
It's not good.
No.

3706
02:43:04,690 --> 02:43:06,490
That might be what my neck hurts.
It's not because of my.

3707
02:43:06,491 --> 02:43:08,270
I be that as well.
Yeah.

3708
02:43:08,500 --> 02:43:09,160
But that.
But,

3709
02:43:09,220 --> 02:43:12,100
but you know like I'm but also like 
there's

3710
02:43:12,100 --> 02:43:15,250
a lot of truth in that like that.
I feel like it's sort of started working

3711
02:43:15,251 --> 02:43:16,810
and I was just looking around my place 
the other day.

3712
02:43:16,811 --> 02:43:21,811
Like maybe the next phase will be like a
little bit more something.

3713
02:43:22,630 --> 02:43:24,430
Well I feel like it's a rabbit hole that
you have.

3714
02:43:24,550 --> 02:43:29,550
You have to be really careful when they 
step in because it will suck your time 

3715
02:43:29,550 --> 02:43:31,240
up.
This hunting thing suck my time up.

3716
02:43:31,241 --> 02:43:34,000
If I went into the manufacturing my own 
furniture thing,

3717
02:43:34,400 --> 02:43:39,400
like doubting my own wood and milling it
and so and unfortunately I have friends 

3718
02:43:39,400 --> 02:43:41,650
that are professional woodworkers,
you know,

3719
02:43:41,990 --> 02:43:44,290
I,
I know like that.

3720
02:43:44,291 --> 02:43:48,580
It is possible to learn all that stuff 
and then build furniture.

3721
02:43:48,581 --> 02:43:50,440
You could do it,
but then you'd have to say,

3722
02:43:50,441 --> 02:43:52,810
okay,
well am I going to weave my own cloth to

3723
02:43:52,811 --> 02:43:55,090
cover this furniture?
You turn it on your own butter.

3724
02:43:55,090 --> 02:43:55,870
I mean,
what are we talking about?

3725
02:43:55,871 --> 02:44:00,871
Going to use the elk that I killed for 
the leather that covers the couch and 

3726
02:44:00,871 --> 02:44:02,770
I'm going to have to kill quite a few 
animals to populate my house.

3727
02:44:02,771 --> 02:44:04,510
The whole thing would be a blood bath,
nuts,

3728
02:44:04,750 --> 02:44:06,280
a lot of work.
So a lot of work.

3729
02:44:06,310 --> 02:44:09,070
Or am I going to get one of them crazy 
Indian weaves,

3730
02:44:09,340 --> 02:44:10,780
you know,
when you'd like to have the yarn,

3731
02:44:10,781 --> 02:44:13,690
you pull it through and you push it down
and make your own cloth.

3732
02:44:13,750 --> 02:44:15,220
Yeah.
It's a lot of fucking words.

3733
02:44:15,310 --> 02:44:17,800
Do you feel like you're there and that 
place,

3734
02:44:17,801 --> 02:44:22,801
that place on the other side where 
you've sort of built what you wanted to 

3735
02:44:22,801 --> 02:44:26,011
build and,
and your life and your work and all of 

3736
02:44:26,011 --> 02:44:26,430
the sort of lined up?
No,

3737
02:44:26,520 --> 02:44:29,160
I don't think that,
yeah,

3738
02:44:29,340 --> 02:44:33,040
I might think like that.
I don't worry about money.

3739
02:44:33,130 --> 02:44:34,540
Yeah,
don't worry about money.

3740
02:44:34,570 --> 02:44:37,420
But um,
I worry about work in,

3741
02:44:37,470 --> 02:44:39,730
in that I want to make sure that 
everything I'm doing is good.

3742
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Whether it's podcasts or whether it's 
stand up or whether it's doing my 

3743
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:48,361
commentary.
I always want to make sure that I'm not 

3744
02:44:48,361 --> 02:44:49,900
doing bad stuff and that if I,
if I have done something that's not that

3745
02:44:49,901 --> 02:44:54,901
good,
I make sure that that doesn't happen 

3746
02:44:54,901 --> 02:44:54,901
ever again or that if it does happen 
again.

3747
02:44:54,901 --> 02:44:55,720
I learned from that one too and then it 
gets better even there.

3748
02:44:55,990 --> 02:44:57,400
So there's that.
Like,

3749
02:44:57,420 --> 02:45:02,420
it's not like shit I gotta pay my bills,
but I do remember that feeling bad and I

3750
02:45:03,281 --> 02:45:05,830
also remember the moment that that went 
away.

3751
02:45:06,100 --> 02:45:09,820
How free it was.
Like I got a development deal when I was

3752
02:45:09,821 --> 02:45:12,470
like,
I don't know how many years in economy,

3753
02:45:12,490 --> 02:45:17,490
but it's like 93 and I got a big check 
from Disney of all people and all of a 

3754
02:45:17,741 --> 02:45:21,040
sudden I didn't have to worry about how 
I was paying my rent all of a sudden for

3755
02:45:21,041 --> 02:45:26,041
at least the next year or so,
or a couple of years it was paid and it 

3756
02:45:26,041 --> 02:45:30,130
was like this silence,
like this weight.

3757
02:45:30,220 --> 02:45:33,400
Just literally a physical weight lifted 
off my shoulders.

3758
02:45:33,700 --> 02:45:35,320
And then I thought about it and I said,
man,

3759
02:45:35,321 --> 02:45:37,690
you know what?
Some people never get to that place.

3760
02:45:37,691 --> 02:45:40,030
They live their life from cradle to the 
grave,

3761
02:45:40,031 --> 02:45:43,060
constantly under the pressure of bills,
check to check,

3762
02:45:43,300 --> 02:45:48,300
and that that freedom of not worrying 
about your bills is massive and people 

3763
02:45:49,361 --> 02:45:54,361
trip themselves up by putting themselves
in debt and by getting in over their 

3764
02:45:54,361 --> 02:45:57,871
head,
giving themselves a bunch of shit that 

3765
02:45:57,871 --> 02:45:57,970
they don't need.
Then they have to pay for it or they buy

3766
02:45:57,971 --> 02:46:00,370
it on credit and they have to fucking 
don't worry.

3767
02:46:00,371 --> 02:46:04,660
I'll figure out a way and that that 
pressure is overwhelming for people.

3768
02:46:05,440 --> 02:46:10,440
When that pressure went away,
it was replaced by the pressure to try 

3769
02:46:10,440 --> 02:46:10,440
to do good stuff,

3770
02:46:10,440 --> 02:46:12,620
to try to do things that I can be proud 
of,

3771
02:46:12,621 --> 02:46:14,810
to try to do things.
Where are you doing that already?

3772
02:46:15,140 --> 02:46:20,140
Yeah,
but I was trying to do it and I was 

3773
02:46:20,140 --> 02:46:21,821
worried about making money at the same 
time and as soon as the worry about 

3774
02:46:21,821 --> 02:46:23,780
making money kind of goes away.
Then your.

3775
02:46:23,810 --> 02:46:26,990
You're left with a pure sense of why 
you're doing it.

3776
02:46:27,020 --> 02:46:30,050
So isn't that for all the things that 
now we put out there,

3777
02:46:30,051 --> 02:46:30,980
podcasts,
video,

3778
02:46:30,981 --> 02:46:32,090
audio,
all that stuff.

3779
02:46:32,120 --> 02:46:33,350
Owning your brand,
all the.

3780
02:46:33,351 --> 02:46:37,560
All the things that you do,
I know I hate it to a boy on your brand.

3781
02:46:39,550 --> 02:46:41,300
People say this,
I want to run from them.

3782
02:46:42,090 --> 02:46:43,730
Yeah.
How do you manage your brand?

3783
02:46:43,820 --> 02:46:47,030
Somebody asked me to do a seminar on 
that really recently.

3784
02:46:47,230 --> 02:46:48,230
Well,
you're not worried about money,

3785
02:46:48,231 --> 02:46:49,550
so I guess he didn't have to be pretty 
good.

3786
02:46:49,850 --> 02:46:51,410
I don't think you make much money on 
those seminars.

3787
02:46:51,680 --> 02:46:52,370
Seminars,
pay,

3788
02:46:52,410 --> 02:46:53,460
you know who,
who gets money?

3789
02:46:53,500 --> 02:46:56,600
The people that run the seminar to the 
pimps.

3790
02:46:56,601 --> 02:46:57,220
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

3791
02:46:57,330 --> 02:46:58,310
No,
uh,

3792
02:46:58,550 --> 02:47:00,380
but that,
that's the beauty of all this stuff.

3793
02:47:00,381 --> 02:47:03,770
So you built this whole thing and then 
you're free.

3794
02:47:03,810 --> 02:47:05,210
You,
you answered it yourself,

3795
02:47:05,410 --> 02:47:10,410
you know,
this is a very unique time for people 

3796
02:47:10,410 --> 02:47:13,721
like us because finally,
all of this exists so that we can 

3797
02:47:13,721 --> 02:47:14,280
control our destiny.
You know,

3798
02:47:14,400 --> 02:47:19,400
and I'm,
I'm attached to a network or has been 

3799
02:47:19,400 --> 02:47:19,400
really good to me.
As you said at the beginning.

3800
02:47:19,400 --> 02:47:19,400
They let me do whatever I want.
I mean,

3801
02:47:19,400 --> 02:47:21,230
literally they sat me down the day 
before the show started,

3802
02:47:21,440 --> 02:47:23,810
an executive who I'd never met in person
before.

3803
02:47:23,990 --> 02:47:25,760
Said he's like,
I have one thing to say to you,

3804
02:47:25,761 --> 02:47:30,761
make the show you want to make,
not to show you think we want you to 

3805
02:47:30,761 --> 02:47:30,761
make.

3806
02:47:30,761 --> 02:47:31,490
What is your show on?
What is it on TV?

3807
02:47:31,491 --> 02:47:34,340
What does that?
Which is Larry King's digital network.

3808
02:47:34,580 --> 02:47:36,560
Larry King has his own digital Mary 
King.

3809
02:47:36,640 --> 02:47:40,520
It's with partners with Carlos Slim.
Is that Carlos Slim Jim?

3810
02:47:40,700 --> 02:47:41,270
They said,
no,

3811
02:47:41,271 --> 02:47:43,040
he's not.
He's even richer than that guy.

3812
02:47:43,350 --> 02:47:48,350
They say he's the.
He was either the richest or second 

3813
02:47:48,350 --> 02:47:48,800
richest man in the world.
He's a Mexican telecom billionaire.

3814
02:47:48,810 --> 02:47:49,730
Yeah.
He partly.

3815
02:47:49,731 --> 02:47:51,770
When's The New York Times now and a 
bunch of other stuff.

3816
02:47:52,160 --> 02:47:54,920
They're part digital network and part 
production company.

3817
02:47:54,921 --> 02:47:59,470
So William Shatner as a show there.
Jesse Ventura as a show say.

3818
02:47:59,510 --> 02:48:01,280
Well,
I mean,

3819
02:48:01,281 --> 02:48:01,800
as I said,
I'm not.

3820
02:48:01,820 --> 02:48:05,300
I'm not making six figures like pause 
and I'm not making six figures,

3821
02:48:06,410 --> 02:48:09,050
but they let me do it at King's almost 
dying.

3822
02:48:09,090 --> 02:48:10,450
Come crash.
Oh,

3823
02:48:10,920 --> 02:48:13,040
oh.
To the hounds.

3824
02:48:13,150 --> 02:48:14,420
Yeah.
He's been very good to me.

3825
02:48:14,460 --> 02:48:15,320
You know what?
I'll tell you,

3826
02:48:15,950 --> 02:48:16,500
I'll tell you what.

3827
02:48:16,900 --> 02:48:19,670
I want to hear better numbers.
Believe me.

3828
02:48:19,671 --> 02:48:22,730
I want to get better at ovaries do,
but actually this is the first deal that

3829
02:48:22,731 --> 02:48:27,731
I ever had my agent close for me and 
because I'd always done even my Sirius 

3830
02:48:27,800 --> 02:48:29,830
xm deals,
I did myself and my podcast deals.

3831
02:48:29,850 --> 02:48:32,840
I'd always done everything and when my 
agent did this,

3832
02:48:33,260 --> 02:48:38,260
it was.
I didn't realize how hard it was going 

3833
02:48:38,260 --> 02:48:38,720
to be for me to let go and be like,
Oh,

3834
02:48:38,721 --> 02:48:42,460
I'm supposed to trust you to actually do
a deal now.

3835
02:48:42,710 --> 02:48:45,110
That was really hard for me to actually 
say,

3836
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:46,460
you know,
but that's.

3837
02:48:46,490 --> 02:48:50,820
But that's how you mature in this thing.
You gotta you gotTa have a good agent.

3838
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:54,650
I told you my issue that I had with the 
agent when dementia thing went down,

3839
02:48:55,260 --> 02:49:00,260
but I've had the same manager scrub.
I was just a kid in my early twenties to

3840
02:49:00,711 --> 02:49:04,190
know what the fuck I was doing that was 
able to since I was an open mic.

3841
02:49:04,460 --> 02:49:06,470
Wow.
That's where I got really lucky.

3842
02:49:06,830 --> 02:49:11,830
My,
he found me in Boston when I was make 

3843
02:49:11,830 --> 02:49:14,571
people laugh and he saw something that 
he thought and we worked together ever 

3844
02:49:14,571 --> 02:49:16,440
since and we've been.
He's one of my best friends.

3845
02:49:16,441 --> 02:49:18,300
He's a great friend,
so,

3846
02:49:18,650 --> 02:49:21,930
but because people are,
I think people always confuse her to the

3847
02:49:21,931 --> 02:49:25,560
manage your aging thing.
A manager really is sorta like it.

3848
02:49:25,561 --> 02:49:29,670
A lot of respects should be your friend 
and your guru and you're sort of helping

3849
02:49:29,671 --> 02:49:31,850
you down that road.
The agent is getting you gates,

3850
02:49:32,040 --> 02:49:37,040
but sometimes they're not.
I mean I have friends that have just 

3851
02:49:37,040 --> 02:49:37,950
really fucked up relationships with 
their managers and when you're not doing

3852
02:49:37,951 --> 02:49:40,710
well,
the manager can be a real hard to get on

3853
02:49:40,711 --> 02:49:42,270
the fringe,
codependent relationship.

3854
02:49:42,510 --> 02:49:47,510
You're saying the people in this town 
can be fair weather friends can't 

3855
02:49:48,550 --> 02:49:49,680
listen.
We're almost out of time,

3856
02:49:49,681 --> 02:49:50,210
but I really.

3857
02:49:50,220 --> 02:49:55,220
Before we leave a half to talk to you 
about one thing that you told me that I 

3858
02:49:55,220 --> 02:49:55,330
think is when you do start doing well,
then your.

3859
02:49:55,350 --> 02:50:00,350
They're your buddy.
Like it's an incestuous reared fucking 

3860
02:50:00,350 --> 02:50:04,041
very strange codependent relationship.
You're saying that people in this town 

3861
02:50:04,041 --> 02:50:07,730
can be fair weather friends that we're 
listening,

3862
02:50:07,731 --> 02:50:09,090
we're almost out of time,
but I really,

3863
02:50:09,091 --> 02:50:14,091
before we leave a half to talk to you 
about one thing that you told me that I 

3864
02:50:14,091 --> 02:50:17,061
think is incredibly fascinating.
You came out literally the to someone 

3865
02:50:18,031 --> 02:50:21,960
for the very first time,
the day before September 11th,

3866
02:50:22,170 --> 02:50:26,460
the night it was.
It was about midnight of September 11th,

3867
02:50:26,580 --> 02:50:29,670
so meaning September 10th.
It just rolled into September 11th.

3868
02:50:29,970 --> 02:50:34,970
The first person ever came out to a 
brilliant comic who you've never heard 

3869
02:50:34,970 --> 02:50:34,970
of and I don't even know what happened 
to him.

3870
02:50:34,970 --> 02:50:35,700
This guy,
Mike Singer,

3871
02:50:35,701 --> 02:50:37,380
was one of the best comics that I ever 
knew.

3872
02:50:37,380 --> 02:50:40,470
We worked for years together.
Sky was wickedly funny.

3873
02:50:40,920 --> 02:50:42,370
I think he lives in Columbia now or 
something.

3874
02:50:42,371 --> 02:50:43,710
You're not doing standup.
Anyway,

3875
02:50:43,860 --> 02:50:46,200
he was gay and he was so.
I in a way,

3876
02:50:46,201 --> 02:50:51,201
I was ahead of my time in terms of being
out as a comic that doesn't necessarily 

3877
02:50:51,391 --> 02:50:56,391
play into every stereotype and all that.
This guy was really ahead of it because 

3878
02:50:56,391 --> 02:50:56,850
he was 15 years older than me and had 
done it already.

3879
02:50:57,390 --> 02:50:59,100
Anyway,
we were in the time square subway.

3880
02:50:59,101 --> 02:51:01,170
I was going back.
I lived on the upper east at the time.

3881
02:51:01,171 --> 02:51:06,171
I was walking to the shuttle thing to go
to get on the east side and I had.

3882
02:51:07,140 --> 02:51:10,820
I was just a fucking complete mess.
It's,

3883
02:51:11,170 --> 02:51:16,170
it's incredibly hard to live one life to
live one life on this planet is a hard 

3884
02:51:16,261 --> 02:51:21,261
thing.
Try living too at the same time and 

3885
02:51:21,261 --> 02:51:24,231
that's what I was doing because I had my
life that everyone knew and then I had 

3886
02:51:24,231 --> 02:51:25,740
this secret life where I was out,
you know,

3887
02:51:25,741 --> 02:51:29,520
hooking up and I was lying to people 
constantly.

3888
02:51:29,520 --> 02:51:33,510
Even though I never intended to lie.
I would be somewhere and I bumped into a

3889
02:51:33,511 --> 02:51:35,700
friend and I'd be with a guy,
a gay person,

3890
02:51:35,820 --> 02:51:36,540
and I could just,
oh,

3891
02:51:36,541 --> 02:51:38,610
that's my cousin.
Like it just,

3892
02:51:39,120 --> 02:51:41,190
it was incredible.
I'd never really,

3893
02:51:41,191 --> 02:51:46,191
I mean I never intended to lie to people
or it just became this really horrible 

3894
02:51:47,041 --> 02:51:52,041
game of cat and mouse and I was 
depressed and I was smoking pot and all 

3895
02:51:52,041 --> 02:51:53,200
this shit anyway.
Um,

3896
02:51:53,210 --> 02:51:54,540
and then when it,
when it really,

3897
02:51:54,541 --> 02:51:55,590
so that,
as I said earlier,

3898
02:51:55,591 --> 02:52:00,591
you know,
that that was the fuel for good comedy 

3899
02:52:00,591 --> 02:52:03,591
for a long time.
And then eventually it just started 

3900
02:52:03,591 --> 02:52:03,591
sputtering.
It was like I wasn't happy,

3901
02:52:03,591 --> 02:52:04,260
I wasn't full.
I wasn't,

3902
02:52:04,500 --> 02:52:05,980
couldn't bring those things to the stage

3903
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:07,900
anymore.
And just my life was a fucking disaster.

3904
02:52:08,380 --> 02:52:10,810
Anyway,
about midnight,

3905
02:52:11,050 --> 02:52:13,990
just eight hours before the first plane 
hit,

3906
02:52:13,991 --> 02:52:16,030
I'm in the time square subway station 
with my friend.

3907
02:52:16,660 --> 02:52:21,660
I told him I was gay.
I don't think he realized even though 

3908
02:52:21,660 --> 02:52:22,660
this guy knew me for years,
I don't think he realized that.

3909
02:52:22,900 --> 02:52:23,950
I don't think I said,
Oh,

3910
02:52:23,951 --> 02:52:25,780
you're the first person I'm telling or 
something like that.

3911
02:52:25,781 --> 02:52:30,781
Like I just said it and we just,
we talked for two or three minutes and 

3912
02:52:30,781 --> 02:52:31,130
he's like,
all right,

3913
02:52:31,280 --> 02:52:33,310
I'll talk to you later this week or 
something.

3914
02:52:33,790 --> 02:52:38,790
And I go home and I woke up.
I turned on the TV in America is under 

3915
02:52:38,951 --> 02:52:42,280
attack and I kid you not like I was 
smoking a lot of pot at the time.

3916
02:52:42,281 --> 02:52:44,620
I was not mentally right.
Like I wasn't.

3917
02:52:44,621 --> 02:52:49,621
I remember probably a few weeks before 
that I was walking to the subway and by 

3918
02:52:49,751 --> 02:52:53,010
living two lives I felt I felt like a 
crazy person.

3919
02:52:53,020 --> 02:52:58,020
It's hard to describe.
The only way I can describe it was I 

3920
02:52:58,020 --> 02:52:59,821
remember walking down second avenue and 
it looked like all the buildings were 

3921
02:53:00,251 --> 02:53:04,300
shaking like I was.
I felt centered like I was okay,

3922
02:53:04,600 --> 02:53:07,510
but literally you'd felt like the world 
was being ripped apart.

3923
02:53:07,540 --> 02:53:12,540
That was like the,
the level of disconnect I had with 

3924
02:53:12,540 --> 02:53:13,990
reality at that point.
Like,

3925
02:53:14,020 --> 02:53:19,020
you know what I mean?
Like if you can't express your love 

3926
02:53:19,020 --> 02:53:19,020
properly,
if you can't,

3927
02:53:19,020 --> 02:53:23,040
you know.
That's why we started this whole thing 

3928
02:53:23,040 --> 02:53:24,781
talking about all these guys that are 
jacked and working out all the time and 

3929
02:53:24,781 --> 02:53:24,781
whatever.
It's like,

3930
02:53:24,781 --> 02:53:28,680
that's what I said.
It's very sad to me because these are 

3931
02:53:28,680 --> 02:53:29,950
people who could not express a very 
human thing in a proper way.

3932
02:53:30,160 --> 02:53:35,160
So they end up acting out at 45 in a way
that they should have acted when they 

3933
02:53:35,160 --> 02:53:38,731
were 15,
partying and having a great Milo 

3934
02:53:38,731 --> 02:53:38,731
Yiannopoulos.

3935
02:53:38,731 --> 02:53:41,110
What do you have against a math?
Well,

3936
02:53:41,111 --> 02:53:42,730
Milo,
who you had on a couple of weeks ago and

3937
02:53:42,731 --> 02:53:45,430
I had them on the day or two after.
I mean we argued about that.

3938
02:53:45,790 --> 02:53:50,790
Me As the liberal,
the gay married liberal who's for that 

3939
02:53:50,790 --> 02:53:52,540
traditional thing and him as the off the
wall,

3940
02:53:52,541 --> 02:53:57,541
British gay,
conservative who's against gay marriage 

3941
02:53:57,541 --> 02:53:58,090
because he wants to talk about drugs and
partying and sex and whatever.

3942
02:53:58,091 --> 02:54:00,700
So that's why I love talking to him in 
all honesty.

3943
02:54:00,720 --> 02:54:04,990
And I really enjoyed talking to Milo.
He's trolling and so many different ways

3944
02:54:04,991 --> 02:54:07,300
simultaneously winking at you the entire
time.

3945
02:54:07,700 --> 02:54:10,330
That's the audience.
I think the audience is aware of it.

3946
02:54:10,331 --> 02:54:12,310
And if he was sitting right here he 
wouldn't answer,

3947
02:54:12,340 --> 02:54:13,750
isn't aware of it.
I don't think,

3948
02:54:13,870 --> 02:54:14,860
Oh,
these people are idiots.

3949
02:54:16,960 --> 02:54:19,340
But anyway,
so I woke up and I,

3950
02:54:19,370 --> 02:54:21,100
I kid you not,
Joe,

3951
02:54:21,101 --> 02:54:26,101
I kid you not.
I thought it had something to do with 

3952
02:54:26,101 --> 02:54:29,131
me.
I thought we were like the world was 

3953
02:54:29,131 --> 02:54:32,400
attacked or we were under attack because
that I finally express this thing that I

3954
02:54:32,401 --> 02:54:34,330
had,
the secret that I had had that it was so

3955
02:54:34,331 --> 02:54:38,410
bad that being out caused the world to 
collapse.

3956
02:54:38,770 --> 02:54:43,770
I know that even saying that now,
I've always told this publicly maybe 

3957
02:54:43,770 --> 02:54:44,830
twice,
like it sounds completely fucking insane

3958
02:54:44,831 --> 02:54:45,970
and it's.
That was.

3959
02:54:45,971 --> 02:54:50,971
And it is insane.
But like that's where my head was at 

3960
02:54:50,971 --> 02:54:51,190
and,
and interestingly after that,

3961
02:54:51,670 --> 02:54:56,670
the way I dealt with coming out was I 
would tell someone and then I would get 

3962
02:54:56,670 --> 02:54:57,870
this little burst of feeling better.
I would suddenly [inaudible] you.

3963
02:54:57,880 --> 02:55:01,270
I was like constricting my heart and 
when I would tell someone it would,

3964
02:55:01,300 --> 02:55:03,110
it would open up a little and I'd feel 
better and I could.

3965
02:55:03,320 --> 02:55:05,330
I really could feel like I could breathe
better,

3966
02:55:05,360 --> 02:55:10,360
like really felt better.
And then I would wait until that 

3967
02:55:10,360 --> 02:55:11,210
pressure would start building again.
Sometimes I would wait months and then I

3968
02:55:11,211 --> 02:55:15,080
would tell someone and then I would do 
this over the course of like two years.

3969
02:55:15,320 --> 02:55:16,790
And then eventually I realized,
I was like,

3970
02:55:16,791 --> 02:55:21,791
you know,
every time I tell somebody this thing 

3971
02:55:21,791 --> 02:55:22,610
that I think is horrible and they're 
pretty much okay and I feel better,

3972
02:55:22,850 --> 02:55:23,960
I was like,
I gotta end this,

3973
02:55:24,020 --> 02:55:25,800
it's time to end this now.
And that's,

3974
02:55:25,850 --> 02:55:28,100
that's basically when I told the 
remaining people.

3975
02:55:28,120 --> 02:55:33,120
And that was it.
It's a weird secret because the people 

3976
02:55:33,120 --> 02:55:36,230
that do care that don't like it,
they're not worth knowing and nobody,

3977
02:55:36,260 --> 02:55:38,630
literally nobody,
nobody that I told,

3978
02:55:38,810 --> 02:55:40,790
you know,
my dad struggled for a little bit or you

3979
02:55:40,791 --> 02:55:41,480
know,
whatever.

3980
02:55:41,481 --> 02:55:42,980
This and that.
My a lot.

3981
02:55:43,010 --> 02:55:46,100
The thing that mostly people got was 
that nobody believed I was gay.

3982
02:55:46,400 --> 02:55:47,330
That was like,
my mate,

3983
02:55:47,340 --> 02:55:50,810
will you play basketball?
You play basketball,

3984
02:55:51,560 --> 02:55:52,430
you know,
like that.

3985
02:55:52,490 --> 02:55:55,100
So nobody could believe like they just 
don't seem gay.

3986
02:55:55,101 --> 02:55:58,970
Like I don't like to dance,
I don't dance.

3987
02:55:59,800 --> 02:56:02,630
I learned my dancing from Cosby,
like that's my move,

3988
02:56:02,680 --> 02:56:05,270
you know?
So all of that.

3989
02:56:05,750 --> 02:56:08,000
So that was the main thing.
Everyone was just sideswiped.

3990
02:56:08,150 --> 02:56:09,740
So a lot of times people will say to me,
you know,

3991
02:56:09,750 --> 02:56:11,620
you're straight or you're straight 
acting or saying,

3992
02:56:11,621 --> 02:56:13,230
which in the gay community is thought 
of.

3993
02:56:13,231 --> 02:56:14,660
It's like this great thing,
you know,

3994
02:56:14,661 --> 02:56:16,400
they're a pure,
straight acting your masculine.

3995
02:56:16,580 --> 02:56:17,960
It's really great.
But I don't,

3996
02:56:18,620 --> 02:56:21,350
I don't take it that way because every 
time someone says it to me,

3997
02:56:21,351 --> 02:56:23,480
it makes me feel like a freak,
you know what I mean?

3998
02:56:23,660 --> 02:56:24,350
Like why am I.

3999
02:56:24,530 --> 02:56:26,720
Yeah.
Because I am who I am.

4000
02:56:26,721 --> 02:56:28,250
This is it.
You know what I mean?

4001
02:56:28,251 --> 02:56:33,251
Like,
like I had gay sex last night after I 

4002
02:56:33,251 --> 02:56:33,830
had that grass fed beef,
you know?

4003
02:56:33,860 --> 02:56:36,630
And so I'm gay,
I'm married to a guy there.

4004
02:56:36,640 --> 02:56:41,640
It sounds like a gay person that's a 
pretty gay married to a guy would say 

4005
02:56:41,640 --> 02:56:42,710
that's pretty gay.
That's what I realized.

4006
02:56:42,711 --> 02:56:43,020
I was like,
Oh,

4007
02:56:43,021 --> 02:56:44,250
I'm marrying this dude.
Like I guess,

4008
02:56:45,550 --> 02:56:48,080
but you know what I mean?
That was like,

4009
02:56:48,081 --> 02:56:49,790
Holy Shit.
Like I guess,

4010
02:56:49,791 --> 02:56:50,380
well,
you know,

4011
02:56:50,430 --> 02:56:52,210
turning it back now.
Um,

4012
02:56:52,250 --> 02:56:54,550
it was a phase I was renting.
Yeah.

4013
02:56:54,551 --> 02:56:56,190
This is a long way.
I'm really like,

4014
02:56:56,510 --> 02:56:58,250
you know,
it's dragging out this phase thing,

4015
02:56:58,280 --> 02:57:02,950
but I realized that if I felt better 
when I told people that,

4016
02:57:03,370 --> 02:57:08,370
that there had to be some value in that 
in a way that I couldn't understand 

4017
02:57:08,370 --> 02:57:08,370
things,
but,

4018
02:57:08,370 --> 02:57:12,320
but to the,
to the straight acting like it means 

4019
02:57:12,320 --> 02:57:14,861
nothing to me when I meet guys that are 
completely flaming or if I meet guys 

4020
02:57:14,861 --> 02:57:15,950
that are,
that you'd have no idea.

4021
02:57:15,950 --> 02:57:20,950
Like I like people based on their values
and their sense of humor and like shit 

4022
02:57:20,950 --> 02:57:25,511
like that.
I never asked to all people that matter 

4023
02:57:25,511 --> 02:57:25,511
as as.
Yeah,

4024
02:57:25,511 --> 02:57:28,900
and you know what?
That's a great way to bring this all 

4025
02:57:28,900 --> 02:57:30,971
around because that gets away from 
judging people on what you're supposed 

4026
02:57:30,971 --> 02:57:34,331
to think about them and all that social 
justice warrior and regressive bullshit 

4027
02:57:34,331 --> 02:57:37,720
versus judging people on the content of 
their character and also gets back to 

4028
02:57:37,720 --> 02:57:42,071
what we're saying earlier that it's like
it's just being aware socially being a 

4029
02:57:42,071 --> 02:57:45,920
good person to communicate with versus 
being socially retarded and just looking

4030
02:57:45,921 --> 02:57:47,980
for those Ben Affleck Brownie moment.
Yeah.

4031
02:57:48,270 --> 02:57:51,230
Let me toss in one other thing that sort
of ties into this really nicely,

4032
02:57:51,231 --> 02:57:54,470
so one one time when I was on the young 
Turks,

4033
02:57:54,870 --> 02:57:59,870
and I'm not gonna mention names here,
but I was on and they were showing a 

4034
02:57:59,870 --> 02:58:03,280
clip from Fox News and they were talking
about how the host that he was such a 

4035
02:58:03,280 --> 02:58:03,480
token black guy.

4036
02:58:03,510 --> 02:58:06,640
He was such a token black guy and 
actually know the guy.

4037
02:58:06,700 --> 02:58:07,740
This guy,
David Webb,

4038
02:58:07,741 --> 02:58:10,170
who I used to work with at Sirius Xm.
I'm pretty good friends with him.

4039
02:58:10,171 --> 02:58:13,650
I had dinner with him last week.
He is a black conservative.

4040
02:58:14,040 --> 02:58:15,990
He is a conservative.
I know him.

4041
02:58:15,991 --> 02:58:20,991
I know what this guy believes.
He spends hours on the air every day 

4042
02:58:20,991 --> 02:58:23,040
professing his beliefs and that's what.
That was another.

4043
02:58:23,041 --> 02:58:25,080
This happened a little bit after that 
whole Sam Harris thing,

4044
02:58:25,320 --> 02:58:30,320
but that was another moment when I 
realized how perverse this whole 

4045
02:58:30,320 --> 02:58:34,250
progressive thing is that here you have 
people on the left that are supposed to 

4046
02:58:34,250 --> 02:58:38,751
be about ideas,
looking at the color of that guy's skin 

4047
02:58:38,751 --> 02:58:38,751
and saying,
well,

4048
02:58:38,751 --> 02:58:40,860
because you don't believe what I think 
you're supposed to believe.

4049
02:58:40,861 --> 02:58:43,710
As a black person,
you're a token black,

4050
02:58:44,380 --> 02:58:45,420
you know,
we've all done that,

4051
02:58:45,421 --> 02:58:50,421
you know,
like when they showed like a Republican 

4052
02:58:50,421 --> 02:58:50,421
convention and there's one black I 
talking about,

4053
02:58:50,421 --> 02:58:53,100
but I realized that's actually racism 
like that was.

4054
02:58:53,130 --> 02:58:58,130
That was really a seminal moment for me 
that really changed my thinking because 

4055
02:58:58,130 --> 02:58:58,130
I was like,
this is crazy.

4056
02:58:58,130 --> 02:59:02,631
I know this person personally.
This is a friend of mine and I know he 

4057
02:59:02,631 --> 02:59:04,050
believes he's not doing this because 
he's a token black.

4058
02:59:04,080 --> 02:59:06,930
This is,
this is what he believes,

4059
02:59:07,200 --> 02:59:10,470
and you as the on the left are pointing 
at this guy and saying,

4060
02:59:10,480 --> 02:59:12,990
you're different than what I think 
you're supposed to be black guy,

4061
02:59:13,200 --> 02:59:16,230
so you must be a token or you're an 
uncle tom or a sell out or something.

4062
02:59:16,860 --> 02:59:19,260
And also all of this,
when you have the gay stuff,

4063
02:59:19,261 --> 02:59:23,730
the social justice or either the 
regressive stuff like judge people based

4064
02:59:23,731 --> 02:59:26,940
on what they say,
what they say and what they believe.

4065
02:59:27,060 --> 02:59:28,950
Nothing else.
That's it.

4066
02:59:29,360 --> 02:59:30,800
That's it.
Wrap it up.

4067
02:59:31,110 --> 02:59:32,480
J Dot Reuben.
Thank you very much.

4068
02:59:32,630 --> 02:59:37,630
I'm glad we got together.
I've never had to pee as badly as I do 

4069
02:59:37,630 --> 02:59:37,630
right this second.
I'll run.

4070
02:59:37,820 --> 02:59:39,620
If I had peed,
I couldn't.

4071
02:59:39,640 --> 02:59:42,080
Just keep going.
Just fine.

4072
02:59:42,110 --> 02:59:45,160
People have done it a bunch of times 
show.

4073
02:59:45,200 --> 02:59:46,270
Thank you.
My pleasure.

4074
02:59:46,540 --> 02:59:50,030
This was beyond the pleasure.
How do people listen to your show?

4075
02:59:50,031 --> 02:59:55,031
How do they get ahold of that Youtube 
Slash Rubin report or a TV or a dot TV 

4076
02:59:55,031 --> 02:59:57,260
slash Rubin Rubin Report on twitter.
My branding.

4077
02:59:57,360 --> 02:59:59,510
I told you at the branding.
Keep that brand alive.

4078
02:59:59,540 --> 03:00:00,550
Thanks brother.
Thanks Bro.

4079
03:00:00,790 --> 03:00:01,730
All Right,
ladies and gentlemen,

4080

Open the door.
