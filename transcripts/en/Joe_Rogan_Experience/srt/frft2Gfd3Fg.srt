1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,580
Listen to me.
Dirty fucks cause among going to say this,

2
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:08,220
once the end of the world show,

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,630
there's 68 fucking tickets left there,
probably all spread out.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,940
You're probably not going to
get to sit with your buddies,

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,090
but you got to have to deal with
that shit. Okay? That's how,

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,200
that's how the world works.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,900
If you don't get your shit
together early and get the tickets,

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,450
you're going to have to live in
the fucking boonies for the show.

9
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:27,240
You're going to have to just go out there,
get your freak on,

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,890
sit with some other people. They will
probably be wearing desk squad tee shirts.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,720
You'll be fine. Honey, honey band,

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,780
Joey motherfucking Diaz,
Doug,

13
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:44,781
Stan hope and Wa 1221 2012 will
it really be the end of the world?

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,530
The fuck knows. No one's ever predicted
anything, right? Ever. Do you know that?

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,290
Do you know that? Okay, and
if the Mayans were so clever,

16
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,150
where the fuck are they
now? Exactly. I don't know.

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,470
This podcast is brought to
you by [inaudible] dot com
if you go to o n n I t.com

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,390
and get yourself some Alpha brain or
some shroom tech or some upgraded coffee.

19
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:13,590
We just started selling Dave Asprey's
bulletproof coffee. Did you know that?

20
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,740
A lot of coffee when you buy it,
this is really kind of crazy,

21
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:19,880
but a lot of coffee when you're buying
it, it has a fungus on it, so it's,

22
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:23,340
it's not healthy for you.
I did not know that until we went to j.

23
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,180
We have the Dave Asprey podcasts
and he explained it to us. Uh, his,

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,100
his coffee does not have any of those
issues is he believes that that's the one

25
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:34,780
of the reasons why coffee
has gotten a bad rap, um,

26
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,810
from people as far as health test,

27
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:39,630
he feels like more tests
need to be done because the,

28
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,610
the negative health repercussions,

29
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:45,960
he believes a lot of them stem from
toxic mold. It's on your coffee.

30
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,470
It's crazy shit.
If you go to bulletproof exec.com,

31
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:53,520
he'll explain everything far better than
me because he's actually smart and not

32
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:57,840
just repeating shit that smart people
have already figured out like me. Um,

33
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,520
also at Onnit we sell kettle bells and
battle ropes and basically all shit

34
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:03,450
manly.
Okay.

35
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,890
If you look at and get your fucking your
life together and live at your optimum

36
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:08,640
best,

37
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,970
we sell all sorts of supplements for that
and we got a lot of crazy shit coming

38
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:14,670
down the pipe. We have a lot
of new stuff, uh, at on it.

39
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:18,690
We're constantly trying to hone your pill
ad you were working on a testosterone

40
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:19,470
booster.

41
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,470
There's apparently a bunch of different
natural herbs like I'm tongue got Ali

42
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:29,040
and a bunch of different ones that
have actually been shown to have a real

43
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,630
effect on, uh, on the, uh, your, your
body's production of testosterone.

44
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,260
It's fascinating standing instant boner
pills that I don't need this. You need,

45
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,700
well, you need that stuff that you were
taking, which was basically a, some of a,

46
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:44,790
a Viagara. They kind of like
fudge it according to a Aubrey.

47
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:48,210
Aubrey explained to us how these
a boner pills work when you buy,

48
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:51,960
like those are the supermarket
or drugstore or whatever.
Those actually do work.

49
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,900
And one of the reasons why they work is
because a lot of these companies they

50
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,150
take and they buy,
uh,

51
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,180
I forget the exact chemical name
for Viagara but whatever it is,

52
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,260
they buy that stuff in bulk and then they
throw it in their supplements. So yeah,

53
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:07,290
you take it,
you get a boner cause it's Fiat agree.

54
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:07,611
Fuck.

55
00:03:07,611 --> 00:03:11,540
Cause I guess there's like this loophole
where the FCC or not the FCC with the

56
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,900
FD. Yeah. And WIA and
Drug Administration. Yeah.

57
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,020
They give you like a warning if they catch
you and so like a little fine and you

58
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:20,520
know,
and then

59
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,280
if you get, if you get busted again like
the third time, apparently it's big one.

60
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,670
It'll just change the cause.
That's what the boner pills are.

61
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,070
We don't have anything fake.
Okay. Everything we're selling,

62
00:03:29,071 --> 00:03:32,220
especially with regards to supplements,
it's very important.

63
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:37,020
Brian and I sort of agreed this when
we first started taking on sponsors,

64
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,850
we didn't want to take on anybody shady.

65
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,840
We've passed on people we've
had some offers for, you know,

66
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,170
would have paid us
money that we were like,

67
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,420
I don't think we shouldn't
be involved with that.

68
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:50,280
We only want to be involved with
people that are doing legit,

69
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,690
honorable things.

70
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:55,770
And one of the coolest things
about [inaudible] is the
supplements are very good

71
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:57,900
that the highest quality available,
but if you don't like,

72
00:03:57,901 --> 00:04:00,660
if you order 30 pills of Alpha brain,
you try it and say,

73
00:04:00,661 --> 00:04:03,810
this doesn't do anything for me. You
get, you can get 100% of your money back.

74
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:06,360
You don't have to return the product.
Do you say the shit sucks? That's how,

75
00:04:06,361 --> 00:04:08,490
first of all, how confident we
are that we'll we're selling.

76
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:13,050
You actually works if you're a mass
and your health is not in order.

77
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,380
You got a neat deal with that first
before you think about any of the facts of

78
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,010
supplements,
especially something subtle and a,

79
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:22,410
although effective like nootropics. You
got to get your body together. Okay,

80
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,320
do you eat healthy?
Drink a fuck load of water.

81
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:29,490
If you're taking opiates, stop.
If you're smoking cigarettes,

82
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:33,570
please try to stop. Drink a fuck load
of water. Take yourself was that,

83
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,350
don't take the powder. If you don't,
you ever find this boner pill at that?

84
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,620
Don't take it. It's not good. No,

85
00:04:37,621 --> 00:04:39,630
because I thought it was good
cause the guy said was awesome.

86
00:04:39,631 --> 00:04:42,930
But look at the bottom right.
It says one capsule for three days.

87
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,970
I had a boner for three days,
so don't do that.

88
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,570
Oh well you know what that means
apparently, but the way it works is

89
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,920
there's Viagra but then there's
Cialis and Cialis, Cialis.

90
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:56,320
I almost will last like a couple of days.

91
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,160
So that's probably what they put in now.

92
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,910
All right, well that's
not a good idea. Yeah,

93
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,070
they're selling you,

94
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:03,980
they're selling you some fucking
drugs and they're sneaking them in.

95
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,560
Well that's the thing about
supplements. It's like, it's really,

96
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:08,990
it's a funky thing because the government,

97
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,110
although obviously they don't do the
best job of regulating the dangerous

98
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,280
chemicals and, and, and um,

99
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,770
actual pharmaceutical drugs because
there's a lot of them that wind up being

100
00:05:18,771 --> 00:05:19,820
like really dangerous.

101
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:23,930
A lot of them that they pass at p people
wind up dying from getting strokes.

102
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:24,561
And I mean,

103
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:29,450
we've all heard those late night lawsuits
where someone who was on x drug for,

104
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:31,010
you know,
during the period of this year,

105
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:33,680
in that year when it's snuck through
and something was really bad for you.

106
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,800
But the supplement industry is
not really regulated at all.

107
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:38,690
It's really kind of a wild west situation.

108
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,680
That's why it's really difficult when
it comes to something like a nootropic.

109
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:47,000
It's like this is this really work cause
this real there on on a.com if you go

110
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:50,630
there, this is a science page
that explains all of the, the,

111
00:05:50,631 --> 00:05:53,120
the clinical studies that have been done
in the various ingredients and what's

112
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:55,100
good about them and what's been shown,

113
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,970
how they've been shown to improve
people's scores. Uh, anecdotal evidence,

114
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:01,210
I'm a huge fan of it.
I'm a poker players.

115
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,650
A lot of poker players love Alpha brain.

116
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,890
It's just another thing that you should
be doing to keep your body functioning

117
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:12,150
at an optimal level. It's not
the one thing that's going
to fix you, but it is a,

118
00:06:12,151 --> 00:06:13,280
another thing that will help you.

119
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,640
It is all the various
nutrients that support the the
brain's production of human

120
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:23,360
neurotransmitters. And even Dennis
Mckenna was impressed by our ingredients,

121
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,630
which was very exciting. Use Account
Code, name, Rogan and save yourself. Um,

122
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,060
10% off any and all supplements.
All right. Your Fox.

123
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,490
We have too many pot.
We have too many sponsors

124
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,370
live anymore. Yeah, we have a
fucking shitload. We've done.

125
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:42,110
You want to say something?
Yeah, I just got my ting. Fun.
Yes. Sponsor. How crazy. Huh?

126
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,110
I said that's our next sponsor
because they finally get,

127
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:47,860
gave me one of these
Samsung Galaxy s three,

128
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,370
which had been playing around like
crazy with and it's great man.

129
00:06:51,371 --> 00:06:53,710
And that fucking big scream
really is a big difference.

130
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,100
Game Changer when you go online. Yeah.
It's a game changer. Apple, you fucked up.

131
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,860
You should've just admitted
that you fucked up and went,

132
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,590
went with the bigger screen. Yeah.
Who's working over the apple now?

133
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,610
Steve jobs probably would have
went with a bigger screen. And you,

134
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,440
it feels great about it because I,
I'm going to be using it as my,

135
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,630
my second phone is that you,

136
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:16,340
if you don't want to like pay for
it, you could just lower your, your,

137
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:20,270
your minutes down to almost nothing
per month. I think that the lowest,

138
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:23,940
it was like six bucks a month for
having like just nothing like, you know,

139
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,240
so how many minutes is it?
Uh,

140
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,570
I think you pay per minute when you're
down at six bucks a month. Oh Wow.

141
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:31,060
So it's like when you're
in a foreign country,

142
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,640
so like you could just pretty much like
Jeff fall off the face of the planet

143
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:35,710
with that phone.
If you want to know.

144
00:07:35,711 --> 00:07:38,590
I know a lot of people have down
to like no phone calls right there.

145
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,480
They're like, oh, you texted me if
you called them up, they don't answer.

146
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:43,550
And it's just say, don't leave
me a message. Leave me a tax.

147
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:46,690
I don't listen to my voicemails.
I know like 10 people that,

148
00:07:46,691 --> 00:07:50,840
that rocket like that.
What Tang is a what Brian's talking about.

149
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,390
Unfortunately honey, honey, it's
just sitting here staring at nothing.

150
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,200
Just nothing here,

151
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,550
but then they have bad ass phones and
they're pretty much unlocked on tings

152
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:04,280
network. So you could pretty
much just get sweet phone.

153
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:08,210
You don't have to have in any contract.
You go there. And I think if you put in,

154
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,360
what does it, ting slash Joe Rogan. It's
broken.ting.com if you go to Rogan dot.

155
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:12,450
Yeah,

156
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,220
ting.com you first of all, you save
50 bucks off of uh, any of these.

157
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:20,090
A really sweet android phones.
They have the uh, the note as well,

158
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:23,700
which is that Samsung fucking
giant tablet phone most.

159
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,770
It's so ridiculous. It's so
awesome though. I that Ma, I
must possess it. It's like,

160
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,260
can I have to add in your pocket?
When I look at it,

161
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:32,960
I get envy because people at shows that
come and they take pictures with me

162
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:35,690
after the shows and they all, so many of
them have that note in that always go,

163
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,280
Ooh, I wish I had your phone,
your phone. I've got phone envy.

164
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,930
The galaxy s three is the phone MV.
I'm fine with that. That one's fine.

165
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,200
It doesn't really need to be any bigger,
but the iPhone, it leaves me lacking.

166
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:48,990
I'm sad.
Dad,

167
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,470
do you remember we've had phone in envy
for so long mean you like you would have

168
00:08:52,471 --> 00:08:56,340
like the, the east seven 15 we're like,
oh my God, they just the e eight 15

169
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,310
like the Motorola flip phone,
stupid phones.

170
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,210
But I took a great fucking picture with
that phone when the greatest pictures

171
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:07,170
that ever took him by the hooker, the
hooker when we're working in downtown La.

172
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,420
And uh, it was not the downtown
La of today, which is a,

173
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,540
what's that word?

174
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,010
What's that word when they move into
a neighborhood gentrify black cloud,

175
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,330
black cloud or wipe out.

176
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,830
This woman was walking by and she was
heating a meatball sub and she had a wig

177
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:26,340
on and she was an overweight
African-american Hooker.

178
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,780
And I looked at her and, and she goes,
how you doing? I go, what's up baby?

179
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,960
And she pulls a tid out as I'm taking
a picture of her with a meatball sub in

180
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:40,440
one hand and a tit and the other.
And it's perfectly framed.

181
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,650
Like if I was a conspiracy theorist,
I would say, well, this was fake.

182
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,620
This is obviously Photoshop.
This never really took place.

183
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,220
Do you think it's perfectly frank? I think
it's online, right? You find it, pull it,

184
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:54,090
pull it up. Oh, it's a woman's breast.

185
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:58,350
It's not even pornographic,
disturbing looking like it.

186
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,140
You can see a male's breasts.
Why can't you see a woman's breasts?

187
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,990
You know what's fascinating?
You can see Chazz Palminteri is brass.

188
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:08,100
Did you know that? Yes. Not
Chazz. Palminteri Chaz Bono.

189
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,950
I get them confused.
The Bronxdale.

190
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,960
I bet you could find it. I bet you
could see his as well. He's married.

191
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,000
No disrespect to Mr Palminteri.

192
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:23,001
It was a slip and met Chaz Bono who used
to be used to be chastity Bono and then

193
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:27,360
it's a famous daughter of share and got
a sex change while there was like these

194
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:31,650
photos of her walking down the beach
topless because now she's a man.

195
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,730
Now she's got like a beard,
so she's allowed to walk topless.

196
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,600
So she's taking advantage of that
and she's walking topless and she's,

197
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,110
that's her. That's her. That's the girl.
That's the lady that is a real picture.

198
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:45,630
Pull that shit up all the way
Ustream was with us. Don't worry.

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,420
Brattle will be fine with it. Dot.
Don't do it, Brian. I'll do that.

200
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,120
Just show them. Show them the meatball
sub. Just the meatball sub in a hand.

201
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:58,440
Come on photos. Perfectly framed. Listen,

202
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,170
do you can you can Photoshop one,
make a copy of that.

203
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,080
Make a copy of that and just put
a little blurry on the nipple

204
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,360
that only take you a second ago.
Can you do that Brian?

205
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,190
The folks that are listening to this
are not getting the full experience,

206
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,390
but you could find,
what is the v how'd you,

207
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,870
if you just type a black hooker
Rogan, there you go. That's my girl.

208
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,440
Greatest picture I ever took and I took
it. One of those stupid flip phones.

209
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,930
So the phones at tin has are a farce
period there. They're the best,

210
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,740
the best android phones
that you could buy.

211
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,360
Imagine the aerial is on those phones.
They must be crazy.

212
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,870
It'd be so crystal clear. Then people
would really say that. I faked it. Um, it,

213
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,680
it's an awesome company.
They don't have contracts.

214
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:46,440
They have really reasonable
rates. And if, uh,

215
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,020
if you don't use all the minutes in your
plan, they refund you the money on your,

216
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,190
the next bill. That's tit. They knock
your next bill down. It's like, it's

217
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,770
like the best company. It's like
they're ethical. They're not evil.

218
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:59,440
It's possible to run a
business and not be evil.

219
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,810
It's possible to provide
an excellent service,

220
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:05,170
which by the way is off the sprint
backbone there on the sprint backbone.

221
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,170
So you're getting sprint coverage.
You're getting, it's not like, you know,

222
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:11,230
fucking Fred cell phone service.
It's like legit.

223
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:15,670
It's a huge nationwide network that's
really excellent. And it's CDMA,

224
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:19,870
which I prefer to GSM. GSMS
at T. And. T. I have both,

225
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,310
but I'm a t and t works better overseas.
Most people accepted overseas,

226
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,070
but CDMA,
I find like Verizon and sprint,

227
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,940
I find that it's just seems to be a better
coverage. That's just where we live.

228
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,740
rogan.ting.com go there.
Save yourself 50 bucks.

229
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:37,740
You dirty fucks.
You got that video game.

230
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:40,160
It's pretty bad ass that I've
been playing. Yes. Kerosene games.

231
00:12:40,161 --> 00:12:45,160
This is our last sponsor. Um, blade
slinger is this game that kerosene games.

232
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,820
Uh, we, you know, we want to
make sure, again as we said,

233
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:52,000
that anything we get involved
with is something that, you know,

234
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:55,570
we would actually use something that we
would actually enjoy and something that

235
00:12:55,571 --> 00:12:58,810
is coming from, you know,
a really a good place.

236
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,260
There's a lot of video games that
they make for the iPad that really,

237
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:03,340
they're not really iPad games.

238
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:07,240
They're like PC games that they it
over to it and they kind of suck.

239
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:12,210
A lot of them suck the way that uh,
this this company, kerosene games,

240
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:13,360
it makes plates slingers done it.

241
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:17,860
They've made this game from the
ground up for IPAD and iPhone.

242
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:21,340
So it's very intuitive
touch controls and with the,

243
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,900
the ability that they have these
processors for these iPads now and,

244
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:26,561
and phones,

245
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:30,850
it's like that was always like an issue
with computer games back in the day was

246
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,160
like, could your video
card handle it? You know,

247
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:34,870
like really like stunning graphics.

248
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:37,690
You remember like playing quake and
those games when video cards were first

249
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:42,070
coming out and people would have like
dual sli where they would have to video

250
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,130
cards just to,
just to power the graphics.

251
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,680
Well these fucking iPads
are so powerful now.

252
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,910
I mean you could see really
amazing graphics on an IFAD.
It's, it's really nuts.

253
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:55,420
We live in strange times. You just
say it. [inaudible] I didn't say that.

254
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,000
I just repeated you iPad
goddammit. Slip of the tongue. Uh,

255
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,590
the game is called blade slimmer.
This is their first game.

256
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:07,591
It will be out for the android operating
system in January or February and it

257
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:12,790
will probably only work on like
the more advanced android phones.

258
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:16,060
Like the newer cause android, you
know, they have like ice cream,

259
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,180
what does an ice cream Sundae or something
like that have a bunch of like weird

260
00:14:19,181 --> 00:14:21,220
names and their operating systems,
they constantly,

261
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,120
so as long as you have like the,
the latest shit it'll probably work for,

262
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:26,560
it's a good one. Uh, but again,
the game is blade slinger.

263
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:30,520
It's a fucking bad ass game. It's only
$2 and 99 cents, which I, you know,

264
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:33,160
I think it's on Sarah, right?
Oh, that's right. That's right.

265
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:35,320
It's on sale for 99 cents.

266
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,630
I think the end of the year you should
totally buy it. Now it's nine, 9 cents.

267
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:41,420
What the fuck is, you know, if you
can't, if you can get a homeless person,

268
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:42,350
a dollar,
you can buy

269
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,380
game, uh, that, that will,
yeah, that's ridiculous.

270
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,810
That's amazing. I didn't know that. Yeah,
I didn't even think about it that way.

271
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,010
You know,
like a homeless guy on a

272
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,970
dollar. Yeah. Like this is
something that you will enjoy.

273
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,290
That homeless guys is going to
be like woo. Dolor yes, exactly.

274
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:05,270
And this guy, um, this game, uh,
what the fuck are you talking about?

275
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,660
If you go to, if you go to kerosene
games.com, forward slash blade slinger,

276
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,990
right. There's a, a really a, a
cool a preview. You could actually,

277
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:18,830
we could actually show it here and it'll
look good as opposed to at my stupid

278
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:22,160
studio, which has shit Internet
bandwidth, have a new studio,

279
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:26,000
but the Internet sucks a fat one. So we're
here. That's what we're here. Oh dear.

280
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,420
A points unknown.

281
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,810
You can't tell the people on the
Internet where the fuck your studio is.

282
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:38,180
Is the phone number, man. I just
want to call and talk to you anyway.

283
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,310
Go there. Go check it out. Go Fuck
Yourself. Okay honey, honey is here.

284
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,970
Goddammit. Video that blade. Sing.
Sure. Put it on. Oh wait, nevermind.

285
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,280
There's an advertisement, an
advertisement first. Come on. Period.

286
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,010
Second advertisement or whoever,
or kerosene games. Listen to me.

287
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:56,130
Take that fucking ad.

288
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,890
You're selling of video game and you're
going to have an ad, the front of it.

289
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,870
They're fucking you man. All right, so the
ruin and your click through rates. Okay.

290
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,450
All right. This doesn't
have one. Here we go. Okay,

291
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,590
so this is uh,
the game graphics actually,

292
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,130
which looks like to me almost
like an x box and a ps three

293
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,780
is a deserted. He sends his days of war.
May Not, that's not the real narrator.

294
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,540
The narrator,
this is a four year old kid.

295
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,920
One of the things we want
to call attention to here
and integrate. So there's,

296
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,370
this is,
this is just like a,

297
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:35,250
a like one of those where
it's a preview of the game,

298
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,250
but it's a trailer

299
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,810
or anything. Yeah, it's a,
but it's cool. You use your,

300
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,240
your iPad to like swipe and you know,
do certain signs when you're,

301
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:47,840
you're attacking and stuff like that.
But uh, the graphics are amazing.

302
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:52,160
It's a fun game. And uh, I think they're
going to be adding onto it cause it's, it,

303
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,210
you know,
it's a,

304
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,350
it's a game that I see has like a good
future where they can just add new maps

305
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:01,280
and stuff like that cause they already
have the, uh, the groundwork down.

306
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,600
So yeah.

307
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,150
Powerful Blade Center. Yeah, go
check it out. Like I said, it's a,

308
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:10,100
it's a dollar now that's a,
that's the latest. So, uh,
they're very happy with it.

309
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:14,960
It's for until December 29th or so,

310
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:19,700
and then returned return to
its normal price. So, uh,
right now get it for a buck.

311
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,140
You are not paying attention.
We're selling people selling souls,

312
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,660
souls, $1 some seriously high
technology. Honey, honey,

313
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:33,950
is he Brian? Cue The music.
Let's get the party started.

314
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,220
That was probably a long
ass series of brochures.

315
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,910
The Joe Rogan experience,
Joe Rogan podcast,

316
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,230
my night,

317
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,130
our commercials on long, they're
wordy, but we get them out of the way

318
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,060
and then once they're done,
they're done but shorter than Thomson.

319
00:17:53,061 --> 00:17:55,240
Her and Christina has it.
[inaudible] podcasts.

320
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,680
They have long commercials
than us. Yeah. Every time I,

321
00:17:57,681 --> 00:18:01,200
I count to where they actually start
the show, it's like 26 minutes in.

322
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,260
They do at the same style where they
just start talking and then they sort of

323
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:08,220
fuck around and go off on tangents and
they go back to tour dates and stuff. No.

324
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,270
Well, it's weird. That's how we started
it. Yeah. It's a good way to do it though,

325
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:13,200
I think.
You know,

326
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:17,880
they keep trying to pressure me to put
commercials inside of podcasts and I keep

327
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:21,330
telling him to go fuck themselves and
casually. No, they bring it up, you know,

328
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:25,350
they say we would like you to
start introducing commercials
in the middle of the

329
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:28,770
podcast and they can be prerecorded
and we'll stick them in afterwards.

330
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,290
But that seems,
that seems sleazy.

331
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,370
That seems like it interrupts the
flow of the conversation, right? Yeah.

332
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:41,030
You guys hammered yet? I feel warmth
and I feel warm and toasty. Yeah,

333
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,130
we're drinking maker's mark.
Shout outs. Shout out to my boy.

334
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:47,910
Justin loves this shit. Hey
Justin, my friend Justin,

335
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:51,210
we were telling him to go out yard.
Yarders a shit. Bikers. Magrigen coke.

336
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,780
Why put the coconut though?
Why don't I just go right with the maker?

337
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,810
Because he's seven feet tall. He does
whatever the fuck he wants to trust me.

338
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,690
Justin wants to put coke in his
makers. You just let him. Wow.

339
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,230
He's a biggest human.
I know.

340
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,270
I like zero slow mover. Uh, well.

341
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,390
I mean you might be able to outrun
them. It might be, but God damn,

342
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:15,180
when he caught you, you'd be in
fucking lots of trouble. He said,

343
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,480
I have a friend who was a true giant,
really sweetheart of a guy.

344
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,770
This is the dude.
Yeah,

345
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,630
it was a true giant is enormous and
talks like a normal guy. But he's like,

346
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,060
he's just a huge fucking guy,
you know?

347
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,830
That's funny how people are like,
just not created equal. You know,

348
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,940
there's dudes like that. There's a
whole art, our tour manager is six,

349
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:39,720
seven and he talks about that a lot. He's
like, it's really difficult. You know,

350
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:42,690
you go to like when we're on tour at
the holiday and he's like in the shower

351
00:19:42,691 --> 00:19:44,850
only comes up to my
chest between my nipples.

352
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:52,020
He's big and tall, you know what I mean?
Is he can never find pants that fit him.

353
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:57,140
He liked to, to represent pants.
I was watching TV today, uh,

354
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:01,170
and there was a fight from 19 or 2009.

355
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:05,370
This guy semi shelt send me, Shell used
to be the k one Grand Prix champion.

356
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,250
I think he's won at least
three if not four times.

357
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:13,170
He's six foot 11 six foot 11 300 pounds.

358
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,380
And it's just like good luck
cause go fight that guy.

359
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:21,150
He's a fucking legit giant.
I mean he really is a giant,

360
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:23,190
small and mighty though.
Like what about that guy was like,

361
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:28,650
not once the big guys learn how to fight.
The big guys learn how to fight too.

362
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,640
The idea is that the small man with
skill can overcome the big man who has no

363
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:36,600
skill. I, I still maintain that most
most of the time. That's accurate,

364
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,840
but a big man was skill is a fucking
pain in the ass like this stupid ones.

365
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,360
You would like to think that everybody
would like to think the good looking guy.

366
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,980
Good looking women.
A lot

367
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,270
of people would like to
think they're stupid.

368
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:52,810
Nobody wants to think there's a girl who
is way harder than you and also a way

369
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:56,920
smarter than you. That's
too, that's depressing. Yeah.
It's suppressing his fuck.

370
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,260
That bitch just got all aces. You know?
She was born with a bunch of aces. Boobs.

371
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,350
Yeah. It's not fair. It's
not. It's totally not fair,

372
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,180
but that's life and they have to deal
with everybody trying to drag them down.

373
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,230
I'm must. Yeah, I would guess,

374
00:21:11,231 --> 00:21:14,020
I would guess it would be really hard
to be a hot check to deal with a lot of

375
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:14,854
country women.

376
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,270
I've seen women get country
with pretty girls for no reason.

377
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:22,750
Like someone will come up and like ask
for directions or something like that.

378
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,950
I've seen like Condi women
just immediately going,

379
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:29,190
do you know where you're going?
Like where I, you know, how,

380
00:21:29,191 --> 00:21:33,380
how much do you know this area? You
know, like immediately like dismissive.

381
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:38,890
Yeah. I like that girl stealing
something from her by existing,

382
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,460
but being in front of her, she's
not a sister. She's not a, you know,

383
00:21:42,461 --> 00:21:43,900
a fellow human to be,

384
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:48,280
that's like someone who's taking away
from your value by their very existence.

385
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,480
You know?

386
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,480
I knew a girl who got furious at a guy
because he brought a really hot girl to

387
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:59,950
her wedding and everybody was paying
attention to the girl. What? So yeah,

388
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,890
she literally said, you know,
she was like yelling at him.

389
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,230
Why the fuck did you bring
that bitch to my wedding?

390
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:08,260
And me and the girl was like a sweetheart.
She's very nice girl.

391
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,920
Didn't do anything to anybody,
but just because she was there,

392
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,840
she dressed nice and she was apparently,

393
00:22:13,841 --> 00:22:17,080
she was very beautiful
and the bride was furious.

394
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:20,080
Like it took away from her big day and
she kept saying that that fucking bitch,

395
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:22,610
she took away from my big
day and then amazing God,

396
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,580
the whole wedding thing
fucking freaks me out.

397
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,630
That's that pressure of it needing
to be this huge monumental thing.

398
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,290
She's a crazy bitch. Like I,
she got a divorce immediately
in me. I do not pass go.

399
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,840
I don't have no idea.
He told me the whole story,

400
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,330
but my buddy told me the whole story.
I was not there,

401
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,370
but it was a fascinating story. It's like
animals. You know, I was talking about,

402
00:22:42,371 --> 00:22:45,310
uh, I've had females, female dogs,

403
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:49,660
female dogs do not like other female dogs.
They just don't like each other.

404
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,040
A dog world is fascinating. They will
fight if death, if we were able to,

405
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:59,200
um, communicate with each other like dogs
where we would just be peeing on each

406
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:00,460
other all day, Huh? Yeah.

407
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:06,680
And humping in public on the
regular figure out who the Alpha is.

408
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,250
He gets to breathe.
It's amazing.

409
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,270
Ben, Ben's Dog van has a dog
named Larry Bird. Oh, that's
awesome. That Larry Brits.

410
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:19,070
I got pictures. He's great. He's fucking
awesome. Awesome. Very. You know he,

411
00:23:19,071 --> 00:23:22,160
he's really, he's really
Zinn. The dog is. He is, yeah.

412
00:23:22,161 --> 00:23:24,370
He doesn't really bark at all.
He just like,

413
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,960
he wants to be scratched on
the head are very good friends.

414
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,650
A friend of a friend found him on the
freeway in Nashville and we moved to town.

415
00:23:30,651 --> 00:23:33,260
Ben's been saying he wanted a dog and a,

416
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,260
my buddy posted an ad on Facebook
and said, hey, we have this dog.

417
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:37,250
We're looking for a good home.

418
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:40,640
And he's got very long legs
and kind of an awkward face.

419
00:23:40,641 --> 00:23:42,320
So the name Larry Byrd came to mind,

420
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,950
kind of Darcy is, he's an Australian
shepherd. It looks bit size.

421
00:23:48,951 --> 00:23:50,310
Probably 45 pounds.
Yeah.

422
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,660
But I don't know if he's zen or if he's
just real stressed out all the time.

423
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:57,800
It's shutting down. Like I can't get very
stressed when Ben leaves. Yeah, I bet.

424
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,770
Well the, you know, it's like all the
sudden he's got something good, you know,

425
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:04,130
and he's got someone who cares for him
and loves him. I had a female like that.

426
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,330
I had a female than I uh,

427
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:08,630
adopted and she was eating out
of garbage is when I got her.

428
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,680
She was all covered in mange.
Yeah.

429
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,430
I took her in and start
feeding or taking care of her,

430
00:24:13,431 --> 00:24:15,560
but she would have a massive
anxiety when I would leave.

431
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:16,640
She would know what to do.

432
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,950
She would freak out because she
didn't think I was coming back.

433
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,360
You know when you,
you know,

434
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:23,120
you get down to that point like she was
like starving to death and I found her

435
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:27,500
like literally in downtown La.
She was just eating out of garbage cans,

436
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:32,180
big dogs. They have access to so much
Joe. It was, things were so happy.

437
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:35,450
Sometimes you get lucky just
as bummed out too. Well,

438
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,290
it's such humans too. It's like
if you get lucky, you could get,

439
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:42,740
you could grow up in a really awesome
household where your mom and dad love you

440
00:24:42,741 --> 00:24:45,220
and they want to see you all
the time. And, and you know,

441
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,710
you're growing up with people that have
sort of a sense of perspective and they

442
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:52,010
can educate you on the ways of the
world and constantly give you love.

443
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:57,250
Or You could grow up with a crazy
fucking shithead mom and a nutty fucking

444
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:02,540
violent, abusive drug addict, Dad,
and you're fucked. You just fucked.

445
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:06,110
You were born into the wrong
spot and he's nothing he did.

446
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,820
And your entire potential
completely changes because of that.

447
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:13,070
Your entire way of absorbing the world,

448
00:25:13,071 --> 00:25:17,570
of even just dealing with
reality is compromised by
this situation that you were

449
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:21,960
born into with no, no effort of
your own, no Karma behind it.

450
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,150
No nothing. You just were there unless
you believe in reincarnation, you know,

451
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:27,280
unless you believe in,
you know,

452
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,720
it wasn't just no fucking
evidence to support any of that.

453
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,700
But the idea that people were responsible,

454
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:35,420
especially like babies are responsible
for terrible things that happened to them

455
00:25:35,421 --> 00:25:37,700
because of things that they did
in the past life. I'd have to say,

456
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:40,640
Jesus fucking Christ help counties,
the universe,

457
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,010
will you let a baby slide, you know, no,

458
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,890
punish it from some shit that some
other entity had done in the past life.

459
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,950
It's so ridiculous. It's just, um, it's,

460
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,620
it's super sad aspect of this world.

461
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,910
So your life could be awesome or it could
be shit and it's just depending on who

462
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,580
gives birth to you and where are you are,
you know,

463
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:07,660
I mean, we're lucky as file. We,

464
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:10,670
I'm crying lucky as fuck you and I,

465
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:15,671
all of us here and to live in America
to live in 2012 in America with fucking

466
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:19,520
medicine and doctors and the
Internet and all this shit.

467
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,480
Well, it's interesting how
the are challenges change
as you're right. Like, yeah.

468
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:29,190
It's kind of a, it's weird. I was, I,
you know, one of my best friends in Ohio,

469
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:34,140
uh, he, he got really mad about a cell
phone bill. He found out that since like,

470
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,340
I don't know, 2007 or something,
he paid t-mobile $5,000,

471
00:26:38,341 --> 00:26:41,910
which is I think normal. If you were
to add that up. And he was like,

472
00:26:41,911 --> 00:26:44,580
this is ridiculous. He's, I want
to spend my money on other things.

473
00:26:44,581 --> 00:26:48,030
So he stopped using a cell phone for
three months. He didn't have a cell phone.

474
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,870
He used a land line or would
communicate through email on he,

475
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:56,460
he was telling me how difficult it was.
But how like incredibly liberating,

476
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,260
you know,
and not that that's a problem.

477
00:26:58,261 --> 00:27:02,400
I'm kind of segwaying into just like
you're talking about how we've evolved and

478
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:05,790
like technology makes everything so easy.
Everything is like you could,

479
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,370
you could take care of things at your
house right now with your cell phone

480
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:13,250
because you have robots there. Yeah.
Yeah. But it's so interesting. You know,

481
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,140
I've always been fascinated
with people who could, um,

482
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:19,980
who were incredibly resourceful
with nature, like boy
scouts and stuff like that.

483
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,470
Yeah. And like how like just to
go home and make a fire right now,

484
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:27,210
like a little bit of, I, yeah, I sticks
together, whittled myself a coffee table

485
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,920
and I find that to be
incredibly fascinating.

486
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:33,330
It really actually had some spare time.

487
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:36,060
Would like to learn a few
tips if anybody has any,

488
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,310
do you want to be like a subsistence?
Well, I want to know how to,

489
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,590
I want to know how to make my own
boat and arrows really. Have you ever

490
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:47,450
watch any of those shows?
Like a Alaska shows where they like,

491
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:50,060
these people are like, uh,
homesteaders out there and they,

492
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,910
they gather all their food within
the summer months and then they,

493
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,960
they're fucking freezer dicks off for like
eight months out of the year. Amazing.

494
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,210
Yeah. If you're into that, if you're
like, you're talking about like,

495
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:03,920
I like people like living off the land
and like trying to survive out there is a

496
00:28:03,921 --> 00:28:08,560
fucking fascinating, crazy. And this
is generations after generations.

497
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,790
These people just live like that.
Yeah.

498
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:14,120
There's this level of awareness
and oneness with nature
that I think is so cool.

499
00:28:14,121 --> 00:28:17,210
Like when you can, you know something,
you know, you're just like, you're,

500
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,660
you're in the earth and so,
you know,

501
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,700
obviously I don't really have
too much experience with that.

502
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:26,940
I know I'm really good at fishing. I
like to fish. Good. Really? Yeah. Yeah.

503
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:28,520
I'm good at it.
I know how to catch them.

504
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:31,970
You like the shit you're like ready for
like bass pro masters tournaments and

505
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:35,240
shit.
Not really red pass master.

506
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,860
Do I do

507
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,380
fish that fishermen make a fuck
load of mine. Did you know that?

508
00:28:40,381 --> 00:28:41,940
Like professional fishermen?
Yeah.

509
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,050
You can make a great living if
you're like a famous fishermen. Yeah.

510
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,310
How hilarious is that? This famous
fisherman I think. I think we should try.

511
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,420
You want to try something?
You start entering the tournaments.

512
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,680
I mean you're in Nashville. It's like
some great bass fishing down in that area

513
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,580
to this.
I think the world record from the south.

514
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,580
That's the same thing though.

515
00:29:00,581 --> 00:29:03,700
That whole oneness like that just
becomes part of their, you know,

516
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:07,330
their receptive faculties is
they know the, the fucking water.

517
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:09,340
They know about the fish.
Yeah. What's going on?

518
00:29:09,341 --> 00:29:12,820
They know they don't like that kind
of tackle that lore. It doesn't work.

519
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,220
Yeah. It certainly becomes, you know,

520
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:18,610
you have this connection with this
animal that you're going after trying to

521
00:29:18,611 --> 00:29:22,090
figure out how to keep pulling them out
of their world, but tricking them with,

522
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:26,530
with fake fish. You know what a for
ruthless fucking game fishing is.

523
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:30,610
You throw out this impossibly
beautiful wiggling,

524
00:29:30,611 --> 00:29:35,160
sparkly thing that makes a poor fish,
just want to go bite it. And he,

525
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:39,850
he bites it and it gets literally
pulled out of the dimension.

526
00:29:39,851 --> 00:29:41,980
He exists in another dimension

527
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,770
that he can't survive in.
He can't move,

528
00:29:44,771 --> 00:29:47,170
he can't fly around in it
like you can in the water.

529
00:29:47,171 --> 00:29:51,010
Like all of a sudden he's in air
and like what the fuck is going on?

530
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,180
And if we pulled them right
and if it's deep enough water,

531
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:58,990
they'll die just from the pressure
just from going through the deep, deep,

532
00:29:58,991 --> 00:30:03,100
deep water to the surface there. Boy,
like they can't even handle it. Like,

533
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,060
what are we doing out here?

534
00:30:04,061 --> 00:30:07,780
We're supposed to be at like 700 feet of
water and just yank those fuckers up to

535
00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:09,940
the surface and they're just
like, ah, you're really,

536
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:14,560
you're really ruining it for
me now. Sorry, there goes my
fishing boner. No, listen,

537
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:17,110
fishing is awesome. I love fishing,
but it's gotta be a fucking,

538
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:21,880
a real freak out for that. Poor
Barracuda, I no bites down on your lure.

539
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:26,230
And then all of a sudden they're not
the rich or they're like, oh yeah,

540
00:30:26,231 --> 00:30:28,300
they're definitely a top shell fish.
I think they're,

541
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,560
I don't think they're tropical.

542
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:34,570
That'll be think people eat them
that much to their favorite song.

543
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:38,740
Yeah. Did you ever, uh, like, did
you like cars when you were a kid?

544
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,740
Like that band heart to sing that song?
Barracuda,

545
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:43,150
they had a bunch of great songs.

546
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,830
I like heart and yes.
What do you have for me?

547
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:50,770
Brian redband are fixing shit.

548
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,210
No disrespect to the vag
pills and what have you.

549
00:30:55,211 --> 00:30:58,300
But what happened to the old fashioned
boners? I mean, just good old fashioned.

550
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,610
Well,
SSRI has killed a lot of them.

551
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:05,030
A lot of people on antidepressants
have a huge problem getting wood. Oh,

552
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,621
I'm normal.

553
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:10,290
Boners but it's nice to have
like that five hour boner boner

554
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,680
while you're like, all
right, I'll take care of you.

555
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,740
You're just trying to challenge
yourself. Really. Yeah.

556
00:31:17,741 --> 00:31:20,590
I want to see how much bone or I
can have Olympic Boehner style.

557
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:25,890
That's marathon Boehner sex.
But here's my question. Um,

558
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,810
your, your partner, I mean, I mean,

559
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:32,020
are they having sex for eight hours
because that sounds kind of painful. Well,

560
00:31:32,021 --> 00:31:35,040
he mostly sleeves.
He mostly slaves,

561
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:40,330
flux conscious, well played.
That's Brian's thing.

562
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,110
Just gives them Ghp he takes
by Agora called Bro rape. Bro.

563
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,040
You gotta be careful about that.
You can't even use it's real.

564
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,260
Or if you joke about rape,
you support rape. Did you
know that? Stop? Oh, careful.

565
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:55,390
Careful. No. One of the
things I've been noticed,

566
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:57,520
I posted this on Twitter
about a lot of lefties.

567
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:03,770
This is a funny thing lately
where I'm like hardcore lefties,

568
00:32:04,511 --> 00:32:06,940
you know, [inaudible] like to
call themselves progressives.

569
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:12,450
They will criticize stereotypical
Muslims and television and film.

570
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:17,230
Like I saw these, uh, these progressive's
that we're criticizing homeland.

571
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:22,810
Yeah. That all of the Muslim
characters are cartoonish, you know,

572
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,500
and it's like, and it's, I
find it offensive. They were
like finding it offensive,

573
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,790
but it's hilarious that they would never
do that with cartoonish Christians.

574
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:34,810
Like if there was like a, you know,
a TV show and all the Christians had,

575
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:38,320
God hates fags posters and we're
walking around that you would never hear

576
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:40,520
progressive's bitching about

577
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,580
fundamentalist Christians that are
represented in a cartoonish way.

578
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,980
But fundamentalist Muslims, it's like, oh,

579
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:50,690
we have to be aware and conscious and
we have to be like really sensitive to

580
00:32:50,691 --> 00:32:55,580
like these foreign people in their
ideas like wackadoos that are brown.

581
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,370
Like you have to be like really
kind to them and show them kind of,

582
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,640
but wackadoos that are white and
look too much like your relatives.

583
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,550
Like fuck them. Fuck, fuck
the Christians. Fuck them.

584
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:08,360
And little let them be as
cartoonish as possible.

585
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:13,520
But you have to be super sensitive about
the way people who, you know, Islam.

586
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:13,880
It is,

587
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,880
it's not all terrorists are not Islam
as if one ideology makes any more sense

588
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:24,980
than another ideology as any of these
fucking goofy calls make any sense,

589
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,390
any of them. But progressive's if they
don't want to criticize Islam lately,

590
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,050
it's like these cartoonish
Muslim characters. Okay.

591
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,540
That's kind of how I feel about culture

592
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,850
isn't that does as much of cold as any
of the other ones being progressive as

593
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:45,380
called for sure. The, the, the hardcore
lefty stance is a cult. I mean,

594
00:33:45,381 --> 00:33:47,990
there's shit that fits in and it
doesn't fit in. It's like when,

595
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:51,230
when it comes to gun control and these
horrible fucking mass shootings have been

596
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,520
going on lately,
you know,

597
00:33:52,521 --> 00:33:57,521
everybody's answer is always gun control
from the left and everybody from the

598
00:33:57,681 --> 00:34:01,940
right is they need to arm people to
make sure that this can't happen because

599
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:06,200
you're not going into an unarmed area.
And that if people had guns of their own,

600
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:10,130
they would know, you know, they, they
couldn't just do this. I mean, you know,

601
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,100
it's a complex issue,
so it's,

602
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:16,700
but anyone from the left never
recognizes that. It's always,

603
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:21,010
it's always gun control. You fucking, and
the right people, are you happy? You know,

604
00:34:21,011 --> 00:34:24,110
we can fucking believe this shit.
Why do you need a gun?

605
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,270
Why do you find a new hobby?
You don't need to hide.

606
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:31,090
Well, it's really interesting
to discuss this topic, um,

607
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,370
because we just moved to
Nashville and that's a gun town.

608
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,970
There's guns everywhere. And, um, I have
friends that carry concealed weapons. Um,

609
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,370
this,
there's this one girl,

610
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:43,480
she's super hot chick and she's always
got a little pistol in her purse,

611
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:48,260
like no big deal. But I think that
something that's, um, you know,

612
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:52,750
maybe I'll tell you about it at a
later date. Um, I think that, uh,

613
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:58,020
you know, it's, it's a really interesting
feeling to be in, in a town, in,

614
00:34:58,021 --> 00:35:02,620
in a community with that. And
where I see it is that like, we,

615
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,030
we've heard all these stories, stories of
like, um, don't worry mom, dad, I'm safe.

616
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:10,560
But, um, you know, like our
friend, like friends of friends
getting shot, um, people,

617
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,670
people being, you know,
shot several links,

618
00:35:12,671 --> 00:35:16,180
all these different stories and you know,
there's a lot of crime everywhere.

619
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:18,140
But you know, they had, they had this, uh,

620
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:22,660
turn your gun in day to like try and
reduce the, the firearm pop population.

621
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:27,730
But like at the end of the day, like
I don't, I'm not pro gun or anti gun,

622
00:35:27,731 --> 00:35:29,410
I don't even know what I am,
but I'm just like,

623
00:35:29,411 --> 00:35:30,640
I was thinking about it and I'm like,

624
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,570
the bad guys aren't going to turn
their guns in. You know, and you know,

625
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,160
it's a noble,
it's a noble cause to try and

626
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,950
alleviate violence of any kind.

627
00:35:40,951 --> 00:35:44,580
But at the same time it's like they're
already there and I just don't see how

628
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:48,060
they could go away, but I
don't, I'm not making that fuck.

629
00:35:48,061 --> 00:35:51,850
That's like a strong statement and you're
making a logical statement because the

630
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,270
real issue is not whether
or not we change the laws,

631
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:58,620
it's whether or not people won't break
those laws. And the majority of crimes,

632
00:35:58,621 --> 00:35:59,700
violent crimes with guns,

633
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:02,040
I believe in this country are
committed with illegal guns.

634
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,980
So it's already this weird situation.
The kid who was,

635
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,340
who was in possession of these guns,
these were his mother's guns. I mean,

636
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,780
you talk about gun control,
he was,

637
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:13,890
he violated a bunch of different laws
before you ever left the house by just

638
00:36:13,891 --> 00:36:15,510
handling these guns and loading them.

639
00:36:15,511 --> 00:36:17,850
And taking them out of it
and weren't his to fuck with.

640
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:21,840
So he was violating laws and then the,
then the law.

641
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:24,480
Then the question is why
do these things even exist?

642
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:27,300
Why does someone need an assault rifle?
Those are legitimate questions.

643
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,480
Those are questions that we really should
consider. There's no doubt about it,

644
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,140
but the idea that we need to take
all guns away, like it's like,

645
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,870
that doesn't make any sense.
Like if people want it to look,

646
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:40,650
a Timothy Mcveigh did with a truck
and some fertilizer, people want to,

647
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:44,550
they can kill people in in a bunch of
different ways with a bunch of different

648
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:48,810
shit that you can get in his plans
for it on the Internet. It's amazing.

649
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,870
We really stop and think about it.
How many people there are that?

650
00:36:51,871 --> 00:36:56,871
There's 300 million of us at least plus
Mexicans in this country and we only

651
00:36:58,501 --> 00:37:03,260
have this many crazy, people weren't
running around shooting people. It's,

652
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:08,040
it's really kind of
shocking. It's amazingly good
considering the, the numbers.

653
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,780
It's just when something does happen,

654
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:13,590
it's so horrible and so heart
wrenching and you, you know it, it,

655
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,950
it fucks with our heads though.
The real statistics though,

656
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,310
if you think about how many people
actually have guns and how many people are

657
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:22,290
running around shooting people,
it's amazing.

658
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,860
It's amazing how behaved everybody is.
Most part,

659
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,450
if you just look at the actual
numbers of human beings is there's,

660
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,650
this is a crazy time to be alive.

661
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,920
There's 300 million people in this
continent driving around in cars getting

662
00:37:38,071 --> 00:37:42,090
stuck in traffic and the amount of
people that actually shoot people's

663
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,440
relatively small,

664
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:47,670
but when you compare it to other
countries with stricter gun control laws,

665
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,490
you see those numbers drop.
That's a hard,

666
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,020
but the issue is they've already had that.
They, you know, it's like the, you know,

667
00:37:55,021 --> 00:37:58,260
the, the, the question of
how do you take the guns,

668
00:37:58,261 --> 00:38:01,800
I mean you'd have to go door to door.
You don't have to storm houses. You know,

669
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,040
it's like how would you eradicate
the guns from our neighborhood?

670
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:08,040
The way they have an England, the
England, they never really habit.

671
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,390
So when you see like low UK gun
violence rates, it's like, yeah,

672
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:16,260
they never really had the guns. Even the
cops don't have them, you know, those,

673
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:16,921
they do.

674
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:21,000
They have them in case of
extreme situations like
American Werewolf in London,

675
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,840
Wolf gets out if that's when they busted,

676
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:29,440
you can't fuck with a werewolf and
you got a Billy club, silly bitch,

677
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:34,050
silver bullet. Anyway, there's, I
think there's arguments on both sides.

678
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,890
There's definitely
arguments on both sides.

679
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,330
But you know what the other argument is?

680
00:38:37,331 --> 00:38:41,500
The unsung discussion is what was his
kid on? What was going on with his head?

681
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:46,600
Was He medicated? Was he on? Who knows
what from the time he was a child?

682
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:48,670
Do you know how many fucking
kids get put on Ritalin?

683
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:52,690
Do you have any fucking kids get put on
antidepressants like an un, a young age.

684
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:58,080
We live in stir range times of just
manipulating with human neuro chemistry.

685
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,790
And especially when you're,
you're mixing things which people do.

686
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:08,020
And we will take illegal drugs with legal
drugs and it's a psychotic combination,

687
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,960
you know? Uh, the Zoloft
and cocaine. It's like,

688
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,190
it's famous for people going
fucking Berserk on it. Try that.

689
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,530
Just kidding.

690
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,300
It's a, well, it's interesting to know
what was, what was wrong with this kid,

691
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,010
you know, whether he had a mental
illness, whether he was, uh, uh,

692
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,050
whether he was medicated,
what was,

693
00:39:30,051 --> 00:39:34,550
there was obviously something fucking
really wrong with him just to be able to

694
00:39:34,551 --> 00:39:38,060
do that. Just to be able to do
physically what he did and shoot kids.

695
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,310
There's gotta be something right.

696
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,040
Way Wrong.
I was worried,

697
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,020
I was thinking about this the other day
about like all these mass shootings and

698
00:39:46,021 --> 00:39:48,180
all the people responsible for them.
And you know,

699
00:39:48,181 --> 00:39:51,570
I wonder if there were to be an,
I mean,

700
00:39:51,571 --> 00:39:53,670
maybe they're already doing this
and I'm foolish, I don't know.

701
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:57,270
But if you were to dissect their brains
and literally if there was like some

702
00:39:57,271 --> 00:40:02,010
sort of similar common thread of an
excess of chemical or something or like

703
00:40:02,011 --> 00:40:04,740
Hitler,
what about him finding out the bad,

704
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:07,020
you know like saying that
there was a human race,

705
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:10,280
like there's a right way to have a
brain and you know what I mean? Like,

706
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,830
like you have to be blonde, blue eyes,
you know, and anyone else, you know.

707
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,240
So you're saying fine.

708
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:20,460
Common Trait [inaudible] he's saying and
I was like I can't drop them in the lab

709
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,940
running.
He's really funny.

710
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:25,300
I common trait of somebody that's fucked
up in their head and put it on my side.

711
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,910
Pro Vigil. So give me
some, what did he die?

712
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,530
You need to get some sense of self,

713
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:36,140
a good doctor to difficult thing to
talk about because it's, it's horrific.

714
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,870
It's her, right. Cause it's
still everybody's, you know,

715
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:44,080
it's so painful and I think that the
end of the day there isn't anything that

716
00:40:44,121 --> 00:40:45,920
we're going to find out
or be able to fix it.

717
00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:48,890
Whether it's gun control or
anything other than trying to,

718
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:53,690
trying to be as a community, more
aware of each other. You know,

719
00:40:53,691 --> 00:40:56,270
we're talking about all these things
about like at your fingertips and like

720
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:59,840
we're, you know, we've,
we've got cell phones that do
everything for us and nobody,

721
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:03,390
like, I think people stop paying
attention to things like, just the,

722
00:41:03,391 --> 00:41:06,940
the most rudimentary level of,
of human existence and,

723
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:11,450
and communication of just like really
seeing someone and being in touch with

724
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:12,284
them.

725
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:17,320
And I think some people get isolated
and more and more isolated and,

726
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:21,290
and I don't, I don't fucking know, you
know, I just, I'll only speak for myself,

727
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,153
you know,

728
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:26,390
there's a lot of us and the problem is
we can't be looking out for everybody

729
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:29,980
around us when we're not even in
contact with them. We live in these,

730
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,020
these communities where,
you know, there's people,

731
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,410
there's a guy who lives right down the
street from you is to whore houses down.

732
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,470
He wouldn't be able to pick them out
in a lineup. And then, yeah, that's me.

733
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,110
I don't fucking know all my neighbors.
And you know,

734
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,990
I live in a community of people that
are basically strangers, you know,

735
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,560
and they're strangers to their community.
And that's not how it used to be.

736
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:52,850
There's something that happened to us
when we invented automobiles and mass

737
00:41:52,851 --> 00:41:53,391
transit.

738
00:41:53,391 --> 00:41:57,860
And the ability to move
along great distances is we
don't live in work clothes.

739
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:58,983
We,
we,

740
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,480
we don't have the same sort of community
that people did before they had cars.

741
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:06,180
And that's sort of how human
beings were invented or rather, uh,

742
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:10,070
how human beings develop. They did, we
developed to grow up in these communities,

743
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:14,000
tribes where we all stick together. We
all hunted together, we, we farm together,

744
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:14,570
we gathered again,

745
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:17,750
we raise each other's children and then
someone figured out cars and it just

746
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:19,400
stopped.
I just started like,

747
00:42:19,401 --> 00:42:22,640
let's live in the fucking east
side and let's drive up cross town.

748
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:25,220
I want to live in a suburb. So I'd
love to have a house in the mountains.

749
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:28,220
And then everybody was able to just
go wherever the fuck they want it to.

750
00:42:28,221 --> 00:42:31,100
And then they would meet for work
or go over each other's houses.

751
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,100
But the sense of community
got further and further apart.

752
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,710
Like I've had this conversations
with some of my friends were like,

753
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:39,410
why don't we all like live in the
same neighborhood, man? You know,

754
00:42:39,411 --> 00:42:40,244
why don't we do that?

755
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:43,010
Wouldn't that be awesome if you lived
across the street from me? I can't.

756
00:42:43,011 --> 00:42:43,880
We make that happen.

757
00:42:43,881 --> 00:42:47,420
Like let's like live it fun to play
basketball with you all the time.

758
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,420
But that would be fine.
I'd be,

759
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:53,930
I mean like wouldn't it be amazing
if you could like literally live in a

760
00:42:53,931 --> 00:42:55,340
community of all of your friends?

761
00:42:55,341 --> 00:42:58,310
I don't know anybody who does that
except like there's these guys, uh,

762
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:00,700
this mixed martial arts
guys in Sacramento, uh,

763
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,990
Uriah Faber and all of his friends,

764
00:43:02,991 --> 00:43:06,590
they got a situation where they bought
a bunch of houses in the same call,

765
00:43:06,591 --> 00:43:10,610
the sac, I think. And they just all live
next to each other, which is awesome.

766
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:11,503
That's the way to do it.
Yeah,

767
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,040
I agree.
I think that'd be really cool.

768
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:18,000
But it's funny to talk about like
tribal existence where we're,

769
00:43:18,001 --> 00:43:21,450
many of us have come from your, I think
we're, we've all come from, you know, the,

770
00:43:21,451 --> 00:43:25,320
the tribal existence was everybody
worked together as you know,

771
00:43:25,321 --> 00:43:28,890
woven into the same cloth and,
but everybody had like a, uh,

772
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:31,080
a job to do and an end to hold up.

773
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:34,320
And we're in a society where everyone's
just an individual, you know,

774
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,213
for the most part.

775
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:38,790
And it's really interesting to think
about if we were going to, you know,

776
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:43,650
to try to, um, have like a communal
type thing. Again, I don't,

777
00:43:43,651 --> 00:43:44,280
I don't know.

778
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,090
Well, we wouldn't have to, if we lost our
ability to travel distances, that would,

779
00:43:48,091 --> 00:43:52,560
would really fuck a lot of people up
if something happened and society was

780
00:43:52,561 --> 00:43:57,220
thrown into chaos and we lost our ability
to get oil and gas. And that's not,

781
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,840
that's not that far outside the
realm of possibility. You know,

782
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,270
if we look at the face of the earth,

783
00:44:03,271 --> 00:44:06,540
like when scientists start like going
into the past and see some of the

784
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:10,380
cataclysmic events that have happened,
like, you know, the predate human beings.

785
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,890
There's been some, uh, some
big ones, like a lot of them,

786
00:44:13,891 --> 00:44:18,030
like a whole shit load of them and it's
really possible that one could happen

787
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:18,990
and if it did happen,

788
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:22,680
we would lose all electricity essentially
forever for the rest of your life.

789
00:44:22,681 --> 00:44:25,500
It'd be no more electricity because no
one's going to be able to figure out how

790
00:44:25,501 --> 00:44:29,220
to fucking fix it without any real
infrastructure available anymore.

791
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,640
And you'd have a few people that
were by living off the land,

792
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:36,390
you'd have a few people, I mean
that we could go back to that again,

793
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,380
like that one supervolcano one asteroid,

794
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:43,680
there was an asteroid that just flew by
and the Chinese got these photographs of

795
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,000
it.
I retweeted it.

796
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,570
Oh it's,

797
00:44:47,571 --> 00:44:50,990
it flies by every four years
and it's over a mile wide.

798
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:56,330
Some mile wide piece of rock that flies
really close to us every year or every

799
00:44:57,651 --> 00:45:01,220
four years. It's a mile and a half
wide. Sorry, a mile and a half wide.

800
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,653
What the fuck?

801
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:07,490
What's going to happen is times pick
Friday when the end of the world comes and

802
00:45:07,491 --> 00:45:11,330
we've got some stragglers, which will
clearly be the majority of the well turn.

803
00:45:11,331 --> 00:45:15,080
You know, I feel like this is a
real hotspot for um, you know,

804
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,550
survivors.
That's right.

805
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:22,070
So we're going to have to come up
with a game plan of um, you know,

806
00:45:22,071 --> 00:45:26,060
I'll bring the canned goods and
make sure the ratio was good though.

807
00:45:26,061 --> 00:45:27,440
I feel like there's going
to be a lot of dudes,

808
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:31,640
it's going to be a lot of sausage.
Should have bring a lot of booze factory.

809
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:35,240
How many breathable females.
Yeah, that's the problem.

810
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:37,460
Some board games we
have to be real careful.

811
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,580
It was to really make sure
we protect our genetics,

812
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:46,250
their whole fate of the human. Russell.
So now you're talking like Hitler though.

813
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,390
A lot of good points.

814
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:52,200
This is crazy. If you had like me, look,

815
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:56,070
if you had some real
engineering of the human race,

816
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:58,880
you would have to do some culling.
Right? It's like when you,

817
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:02,850
you have a thorn or a Rose Bush and
you have some fucking wacky branches,

818
00:46:02,851 --> 00:46:06,960
you've got to trim them bitches. We accept
that. We accept that scientifically.

819
00:46:06,961 --> 00:46:10,890
We accept that in the nature world,
the world of animals and plants,

820
00:46:10,891 --> 00:46:12,270
but we don't accept it with people.

821
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,480
We connect emotions to the most horrific
and fucked up amongst us and we don't

822
00:46:19,681 --> 00:46:23,100
even want to kill them. You know?
We don't have one kill bad people.

823
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,390
We don't want to prune them.

824
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,270
We don't want to send them to
the electric chair is barbaric.

825
00:46:27,271 --> 00:46:30,780
You know it's lethal injections.
Horrific. We're no better than them.

826
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:35,450
What are you doing son? I don't know
why that is. What are you doing playing,

827
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,840
watching cowboy porn?
No,

828
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,700
I was looking for that asteroid and
then an ad came up on this website.

829
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:44,010
You just tweeted at us about the
last thing you ever want to do.

830
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,580
Expert Lindsey as the brain of the killer.
I don't know.

831
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,320
She talk about this right now.

832
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,380
Yeah, I saw that. That
was a documentary. Yeah.

833
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:56,390
It was a guy who found out that he passed
all the tests for being a sociopath or

834
00:46:58,411 --> 00:46:59,940
psychopath,
whichever one that is.

835
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,280
I was going to bring this up earlier
too. There's this article, it says,

836
00:47:03,281 --> 00:47:07,060
I am Adam Lanza as mother and it's
about this woman, or excuse me,

837
00:47:07,061 --> 00:47:10,300
this woman is talking about her own son
who has a lot of similarities between

838
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,070
him and the shooter from
this, uh, from Sandy Hook.

839
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:18,100
And there's all these,
if my phone was kind of freezing here,

840
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:21,450
but it's talking about their struggles
with him and you know, the, the,

841
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,511
the diagnosis,

842
00:47:22,511 --> 00:47:24,940
they're giving them all the mood altering
drugs and they just don't know how to

843
00:47:24,941 --> 00:47:28,920
handle a kid with this type of brain.
Um,

844
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,040
and that's when it

845
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,140
comes back to,
we've been talking about this a lot,

846
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:34,750
just like how do you approach
the mental health aspect of this?

847
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:38,940
And it's such an inexact science. It's
like, how do you treat these kids?

848
00:47:38,941 --> 00:47:42,070
We don't really know what's going on if
the treatment is making them worse or

849
00:47:42,071 --> 00:47:45,550
better. And that's kind of the gray area
that we're stuck in, it seems like. Right?

850
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:46,511
Yeah.

851
00:47:46,511 --> 00:47:51,010
And we also don't understand
why a person develops that way.

852
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:55,030
What makes a person a sociopath? What
makes a person a psychopath? Is it,

853
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:58,870
is it nature? Is it nurture? You know, it,
everyone's different. There's different,

854
00:47:58,871 --> 00:48:03,240
there's a gradient live. Do you mean
there's like a spectrum of different,

855
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:05,560
there's people that are just
a little crazy. They're okay,

856
00:48:05,561 --> 00:48:06,610
but they're just a little crazy.

857
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,780
And then there's people that literally
don't see reality the way we all agree it

858
00:48:10,781 --> 00:48:11,590
looks right.

859
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:14,530
There's these people that you see them
sitting on the side of the road and

860
00:48:14,531 --> 00:48:16,930
they're talking to themselves in their
covered in dirt and they haven't washed

861
00:48:16,931 --> 00:48:20,140
in the year and they're not in back and
forth and having conversations like,

862
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,840
okay, what's that guy seeing?
What's going on? I mean,

863
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:26,080
he's having a fucking full
blown conversation with
people that aren't even there.

864
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:30,190
What's going on? What's going on
there? And we don't exactly know.

865
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:34,060
We know how to give them some drugs and
make them not do that. And you know,

866
00:48:34,061 --> 00:48:38,050
we know there's something wrong was
his firing mechanism is fucking noodle.

867
00:48:38,051 --> 00:48:42,490
But we don't exactly know what
that guy seeing. You know,

868
00:48:42,491 --> 00:48:44,620
he could tell us what he'd
be, might be lying, who know?

869
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:47,380
You might be seeing some shit that he
doesn't even like talk about and see

870
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,640
seeing dragons, you know,
considerable amount of mushrooms.

871
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:56,620
Then you would know what he was saying.
I doubt it. I say we try it. Well,

872
00:48:56,621 --> 00:48:59,790
I see your point.
Lastly,

873
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,890
you want to do is get locked into a
homeless dudes way of thanking you,

874
00:49:02,891 --> 00:49:07,150
become him. I think I take it back to
imagine people pulling the brains out on,

875
00:49:07,151 --> 00:49:11,350
on LSD. Like that guy from
pink Floyd that they, uh,

876
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:14,510
they wrote that song shine
on you crazy diamond there.

877
00:49:14,511 --> 00:49:19,240
That's apparently about a dude who
lost his mind on some LSD. You could,

878
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,850
you could fuck up.
You fuck up and go deep.

879
00:49:21,851 --> 00:49:25,010
And Suzanne just got nervous and
reach for the market. Not Nervous.

880
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,770
I'm smart straight.

881
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:30,340
I'm accessing my pleasure energy.

882
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:36,200
How does that sound? The booze energy.
That's the pleasure energy. I too love it.

883
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,210
Everything's fine guys. Don't worry.
It's, you know, do you find, um,

884
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:44,080
there's a lot of resistance to talking
about loving it, that people like, Hey,

885
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:48,080
actually I found this is
really funny. I, we got to,

886
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,490
well we talk about booze
all the time because I,

887
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,980
I'm, I'm not an alcoholic,
but I love Bourbon. You know,

888
00:49:56,981 --> 00:50:01,040
I don't drink bourbon every day, but um,
you know, I talk about it cause you know,

889
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:05,140
I'm comfortable that way and we've had
a few emails here and there, um, some,

890
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:07,270
some dude with like,

891
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:12,070
I saw you at your show when you were on
tour and you just looked so tired and

892
00:50:12,071 --> 00:50:16,690
look, drugs have torn into people here.
And I was like, let me just go, let me,

893
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:20,470
let's just go right over this again.
You saw me on tour and I look tired.

894
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,150
That is a shocker

895
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,040
parking lot and I, I, I'm not going to

896
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,060
throw them under the bus, you
know, to be concerned. Right.
But it's, you know, well,

897
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:32,440
you know,

898
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,140
from his point,

899
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:36,850
there's a lot of people that think
that the life of a showbiz person,

900
00:50:36,851 --> 00:50:41,600
it's just fucking drugs and barely keeping
it together and stumbling on to stay

901
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:42,850
the night that,
you know,

902
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:47,720
dude, I know, I mean at the same
time, I'm fully aware of that side.

903
00:50:47,721 --> 00:50:51,420
Like I, it does exist. It totally,
and you should, you know, I'm sure,

904
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:56,150
cause it's like when you're on the road
and you're just moving all the time and

905
00:50:56,151 --> 00:50:59,780
you're never in the same place, you're
never in this like you're fucking lonely.

906
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:02,660
You know, you're, there's
just so much going on,

907
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:06,530
like drinking, um, you know,

908
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:09,590
it was a real couple repetition.
Oh yeah. Cause you're going to,

909
00:51:09,591 --> 00:51:11,600
you're in a different club every night,
but there's always,

910
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:16,400
and everybody wants to party with you.
But at the same time, I really, um,

911
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,350
I don't, I don't like, I like,
I love to drink, but I don't,

912
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:22,670
I don't like being wasted.

913
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:26,720
I don't like not being in control
and I don't like losing my voice.

914
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:31,040
So there's like a balance, you
know, and I'm just, I feel,

915
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:35,150
I feel really lucky that I have a partner
who's, you know, we, we do this together.

916
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,790
Like if one of us was slipping there,

917
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:41,780
that would there be a lot to
handle. But we're, we're pretty,

918
00:51:41,781 --> 00:51:43,750
we're going to drag each other.
You're probably slipping down

919
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:48,230
together. I go slow erosion nicely.
You can count on each other.

920
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,810
I remember one time both keep your shit.

921
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,930
I remember one time when we were really,
when we first started touring together,

922
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,110
Ben got really drunk and I helped,

923
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:59,030
he had real long hair and
I know this parabolic cute.

924
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:03,740
Oh that's sweet. I tied it in a
ponytail. So he looked like a,

925
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:08,390
like a yoga instructor and then like
probably like a few days later I got,

926
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:12,980
I got a little drunk and I remember like
I passed out with like my boots on and

927
00:52:12,981 --> 00:52:13,680
I remember like,

928
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,240
well I let a whole squad or these guys
from the show and just went to town on

929
00:52:17,241 --> 00:52:19,620
her. Yeah. That's really,
that's really fun.

930
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:27,650
I think you just contributed to
rape culture. I was going to say,

931
00:52:27,651 --> 00:52:30,320
and I'm going to call you out really Joe.
Really,

932
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,300
it's cool that you guys can

933
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:39,680
count on each other that you know
that you're both in it to, you know,

934
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,890
to do the right shit, you know,
to get it done that you know,

935
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,020
you're both in it to make great music.
You know,

936
00:52:45,021 --> 00:52:48,830
it's like a lot of bands have an issue.
Like there's like five guys

937
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,210
come on that as the picture
and that you can see it flows

938
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:03,170
block out the nipple because apparently
it almost sunk CBS when Janet Jackson

939
00:53:03,171 --> 00:53:07,220
whipped one out. Who knows what it
could do to Ustream, but this, uh,

940
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:10,940
this lady with her, her 10 out, I
did not ask her to do this. Okay.

941
00:53:10,941 --> 00:53:14,690
This was the universe giving me a gift.
No.

942
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:19,800
Well, yes and no. Cielo Green the whole
time. Yes and no. It did not turn me on.

943
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:24,960
It did not turn me on sexually,
but it did turn me on socially because I,

944
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,070
I was going to post

945
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,910
this online and people are going to go
bananas. I was very excited. I was like,

946
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,430
I have to show people this is
going to give them great joy.

947
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,610
I think this is the part where
he started to lose it. Yeah,

948
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,170
mine. Yeah, I remember

949
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:47,710
Ryan, do you think she's alive now? Cause
that was like 2005 if you had a guess,

950
00:53:47,711 --> 00:53:48,860
do you think that woman's Love

951
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:54,210
Paul subs every day? I'm sure
there's some Italians live forever.

952
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:58,650
Do you think God mother fuckers, they
live forever. That's good to know,

953
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:05,010
but that was a real moment for me. It was
a, it was a great, great moment for me.

954
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:09,700
I wish you had that on video though.
That would, yeah, it would be.

955
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,200
It would be awesome. D G
Galaxy s three via. Yeah,

956
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:18,310
but then she probably sue me. I wonder
if she knows the pictures out there.

957
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:20,680
I wonder if someone was like,
girl,

958
00:54:20,681 --> 00:54:24,670
do you know to your pictures online
your titties out. You got to meet boss.

959
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:31,720
That ain't even me. My wig don't look
nothing like that. That is not that good.

960
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:35,850
That is not me, girl. I'm telling
you. That was a Veggie saying

961
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,980
did he has pictures of you. You got
your titty out and uh, meet Moss.

962
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:44,890
I'll be your hand and bitch. You look fat.
You look like big foot earthquake, gut.

963
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:49,370
Oh, that's a gut. I'm a person who doesn't
give a fuck. She doesn't give a fuck.

964
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:53,930
I didn't access the Dick. No, no. That's
all it takes. That's a real tip, bro.

965
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:58,250
Look at it at the tip
tip like that on a man,

966
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:01,790
a fake tits on men always look odd
and the nipples were never big enough.

967
00:55:01,791 --> 00:55:05,720
And you know that that nipples the correct
size. That's the thing about trannies.

968
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:09,350
Oh, by the way, that's another.
Tell us what you know people are,

969
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:14,000
people are transphobic. Did you know that
Brian? That's a new issue. Transphobia.

970
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:16,940
I love the progressive's are going
after people that are trans phobic.

971
00:55:16,941 --> 00:55:21,290
If you're making any jokes about trannies,
really even saying trannies. Yeah.

972
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,670
What did, did they have to joke
about? We need to be more sensitive.

973
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:27,810
I'm fascinated.

974
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,870
Did we already do we talk about buck
angel the last time we were on here?

975
00:55:30,871 --> 00:55:33,300
I feel like we did. We might not
have talked to them all the time.

976
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:37,380
There's never enough talk about
buck angel. This is that we did a,

977
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:41,910
we did a show with him. Yes we did.
No, you did dip. Fucking let me,

978
00:55:41,911 --> 00:55:43,080
I'm telling you the truth.

979
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:48,510
And we were in a Toronto,
Toronto,

980
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:53,330
Asia, just cute. It's in Canada. Um hmm.

981
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,940
It became a country boy. He confused
the shit out of people that were like,

982
00:55:56,950 --> 00:56:01,250
really it was Toronto, a
country in Asia as well. Um,

983
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:03,163
is buck angel?

984
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:05,420
Well we, it was a, it
was called idea city,

985
00:56:05,421 --> 00:56:09,160
which is like Ted talks and
it was a conference for,

986
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:13,010
it was really incredible. And you guys
played music? We did. Yeah, we were,

987
00:56:13,011 --> 00:56:15,830
we were playing with our friend
Adam Cohen. We were his band,

988
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:17,390
so we weren't playing as honey honey,

989
00:56:17,391 --> 00:56:21,530
which was kinda cool because I felt like
we were just a bunch of hired guns. Oh,

990
00:56:21,531 --> 00:56:23,290
that's kind of fun. Right? Singing.

991
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,610
It was fun. Only when I go back and
watch the videos, I did not play well.

992
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:29,850
I'm not proud of my playing,
but I'm,

993
00:56:29,851 --> 00:56:34,180
I'm fucking working on it and I've gotten
better. So for the record. But anyway,

994
00:56:34,181 --> 00:56:38,110
we were,
the whole thing is Steve Martin's good.

995
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:42,400
He's really good. Oh my God, he's so good.
We got to see him in Nashville's. Yeah.

996
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,720
But, um, anyway, buck angel, the,
the conference that we were at,

997
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:51,760
I was a three day conference and the
theme was women and in all the facets of

998
00:56:52,481 --> 00:56:56,110
like, it was going through
scientific evolution and you know,

999
00:56:56,111 --> 00:57:01,111
in society and like there was anywhere
from Olympic gold medalists to doctors

1000
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:07,810
and psychiatrists and lawyers and an
oceanographer. This incredible woman,

1001
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:10,690
Doctor Sylvia Earle. I love her. Um,

1002
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,200
and then they had two different
tranny's transvestites,

1003
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:20,280
transphobia, angel trainings. I won't try
and tune man. Just be you. I don't know.

1004
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:23,140
You can't call people twinks anymore.
Why not?

1005
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:28,540
At the guy who's the head of the Bravo
for an advocate that goes ahead of Bravo.

1006
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:32,380
He made it stop me, Joe.

1007
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:36,360
He had apologized to the twink
neighborhood community. Let's see,

1008
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:40,680
old Greg had a man Jina I
support him. Anyway, so,

1009
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:43,510
so, so buck angel, look,

1010
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:46,450
you should explain to people don't
know what the fuck fucking angel is.

1011
00:57:46,451 --> 00:57:51,390
A very famous transvestite, transsexual,
excuse me, who's a woman, um,

1012
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:56,200
but is,
is almost as jacked as Joe Rogan and,

1013
00:57:56,750 --> 00:58:00,100
uh, just a massive frame of, of, uh,

1014
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:04,880
of a man of a typical man, but
actually is a woman, you know,

1015
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:10,600
porn. Right. And does porn and a
is married to a woman hall law,

1016
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:14,470
but which makes me wonder,
does that make him a lesbian?

1017
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:16,990
Well he does porn with girls or guys,
guys,

1018
00:58:16,991 --> 00:58:21,970
which I did the maybe girls
too, but I did, I did the,

1019
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:26,140
I did myself and unsolid and I
was like, oh I'm, I'm curious.

1020
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:29,740
Cause I was really fascinated
by buck angel talk to,

1021
00:58:29,741 --> 00:58:34,180
so I went online and I looked up some,
some bikinis a point and it was,

1022
00:58:34,181 --> 00:58:35,014
it was really,

1023
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,930
it really kind of messed me up because
I saw him in the elevator the next day

1024
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:41,980
cause he was, and I was just
like, Oh God, like I'm so,

1025
00:58:41,981 --> 00:58:45,970
I'm so confused. I'm just confused.
But I did it feel like gay porn.

1026
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,340
What'd you feel like?
It was just like,

1027
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:52,450
it was a total shaved
badge and it was just so,

1028
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,880
it was like you, you see the top
frame, which is all like look, see,

1029
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,170
he looks like a lumberjack. He's
got a goatee, he's tatted up,

1030
00:59:00,171 --> 00:59:03,400
he has huge muscles and he
lives his life as a man.

1031
00:59:03,401 --> 00:59:06,130
So I feel it's right to
call him him cause he,

1032
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:09,090
I think that's what he prefers and he
was great. Like he was fucking cool.

1033
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,440
I liked hanging out with them but like,
you know,

1034
00:59:11,441 --> 00:59:15,610
after I saw him getting pounded by dude
that look just like him into his vagina,

1035
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:20,410
I was really,
oh there's buck on the right.

1036
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:22,610
That is so crazy.

1037
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:24,800
Look at him.
He's fucking huge.

1038
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:27,840
That really does look like a fucking dude.

1039
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:37,520
Big Guy. That's crazy. There's
Brian added that song by the way.

1040
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:42,270
Did you really? Did you go
look for that bitch job?

1041
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:46,390
If you go to that actual video, you will
not get that folks. Someone needs to meet

1042
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:51,180
the mix. But yeah, that looks like
a big dude it. Yep. And there's no,

1043
00:59:51,181 --> 00:59:54,990
there's no d downstairs, but does he
have like a large classrooms? At least

1044
00:59:57,610 --> 01:00:01,520
it's, but also really, really excited
that he has this project going.

1045
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:07,340
I just want to reach out to your kids and
let you know that I really had a tough

1046
01:00:07,341 --> 01:00:12,320
time and I was a kid. People didn't
understand me. People didn't get that.

1047
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:16,100
I felt like a dye. It
was, I got teased. I got,

1048
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:20,860
I was in fights constantly.
I was isolated. I didn't,

1049
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:24,230
every time I reach out to,
I tried to commit suicide.

1050
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:29,490
Oh God. Okay. Buck. You're bumming me out.
I wanted to watch. It sucks some Dick's.

1051
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,990
I didn't want to watch you try.
You're acting like a little bitch.

1052
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,340
No,
settle the fuck down.

1053
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:42,140
You're insensitive.
This is more phobia.

1054
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,600
Kieve people.
I'm going to throw up my vegan pizza now.

1055
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,740
Oh, that's fine. And that's
it. Anyway, moving on.

1056
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:56,150
Listen to it takes every kind of
people to make this world go round.

1057
01:00:56,450 --> 01:01:01,160
I think we learned that in the
70s and a buck angel. Good on Ya.

1058
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:04,920
Go get that. So then there was
another transvestite that was x,

1059
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:08,760
the same transsexual, excuse me, I'm using
the wrong, the wrong word. I'm invested.

1060
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:13,100
It's just a pretender in my ignorance.
I was just a man in a dress.

1061
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:16,310
I switched to really live a
sheltered life. When you go
and get you shit snipped.

1062
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:19,730
Yes. When they move into the wonderful
world of people that made the commitment,

1063
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,560
you know the name of them
need a store. How did, like,

1064
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,170
so there's all these hormonal treatments
that they have to undergo and have to

1065
01:01:27,171 --> 01:01:30,290
get them every week or every month?
I think so. How do you afford that?

1066
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:34,100
That's a good question. I wonder if, um,
people's insurance companies pay for it.

1067
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:38,540
Oh boy. I bet they do. I bet. Let's find
out. Okay, let's Google. I bet they do.

1068
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:43,160
I bet this is something that people have
been trying. There's a lot of trends

1069
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,580
that are like really in a bad place and
they do not have the money to be happy

1070
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:54,140
if they were just switch the gender.
And I think that as a community,

1071
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:56,810
we should be doing that for branding.
Name this character.

1072
01:01:56,811 --> 01:02:00,560
I want to give my ultra progressive
Dick Wad. Give it, what's the name?

1073
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:05,150
Like curl at whatever you
want. Cammie. Jill. Shelly.

1074
01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:06,860
Yeah.
A man named Shelly.

1075
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,920
What am I looking for? I'm looking, I'm
looking for insurance companies exchange.

1076
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:18,800
Okay. In sure ain't looking at
Buck's star Vagina. Alison. Guys.

1077
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:23,190
This be good for everybody. I don't know
why I said that. What's wrong with you?

1078
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:26,580
Try and keep up with our our
retardedness. Yeah, I think so. Well,

1079
01:02:26,581 --> 01:02:30,670
I think I'm feeling warm. Insurance
Company to pay for sex change. Bam.

1080
01:02:30,671 --> 01:02:35,671
What Queens woman trap for 34 years
in a man's body wins a battle with her

1081
01:02:37,021 --> 01:02:40,680
insurance company that balked at
paying for her sex change operation.

1082
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:44,670
Wow. A Queens woman. I love
how they, first of all,

1083
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:49,320
this is like really shitty journalism.
Really Shitty New York Daily News.

1084
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:54,180
You don't say a Queen's woman trapped
in a man's body wins about it with your

1085
01:02:54,181 --> 01:02:56,220
insurance company. No, no, no, no.

1086
01:02:56,250 --> 01:03:01,250
You say transsexual man who became a
woman wins a battle with an insurance

1087
01:03:02,671 --> 01:03:07,560
company. You don't say someone trapped in
a man's body. How much maybe she's not.

1088
01:03:07,561 --> 01:03:10,440
Maybe hang out with it for a couple
of weeks and weeks and go, oh no,

1089
01:03:10,441 --> 01:03:14,900
this is just someone that's fucking
crazy, you know, isn't that possible? No,

1090
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:19,350
you've made this like huge judgment
and painted this and um, you know,

1091
01:03:19,351 --> 01:03:22,360
a very biased way.
Although she does the glue to check.

1092
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:26,670
There's gotta be some people out there
that have had actual sex changes and then

1093
01:03:26,671 --> 01:03:31,510
tried to go back. Jack, I'm sure.
I'm sure people were bummed out.

1094
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:32,820
I remember this one,

1095
01:03:32,821 --> 01:03:35,340
this guy got really bummed out
because he couldn't come anymore.

1096
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:37,220
He realized that he was
never going to call it.

1097
01:03:37,221 --> 01:03:38,670
That was what Nina story talked about.

1098
01:03:38,671 --> 01:03:41,850
Nina story is the famous transsexual
that was also at this conference,

1099
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:44,640
the ever mentioned conference.
And um,

1100
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:49,080
she had undergone how many
surgeries been? It was like, yeah,

1101
01:03:49,081 --> 01:03:53,760
like she was addicted to plastic
surgery and she had gone into like 60,

1102
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:58,350
60 times under the needle. But she, she
did something that was really interesting.

1103
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:03,500
She chose to have her body be a canvas
and she documented the whole change.

1104
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:09,270
So she's,
she has videos and there is again,

1105
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,620
Nina stories. Oh my God,
what have you done? And,

1106
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:15,210
and it's funny because like you
look at her and she's just like this

1107
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:20,190
unbelievable,
like she has a figure like Jessica Rabbit.

1108
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:23,640
She looks like Jessica Rabbit.
Exactly. And it's, it's,
it's interesting. It's not,

1109
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:27,060
it's just like,
it's a fascinating visual.

1110
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:32,390
And she was really intense and she was
talking about her like her power and her

1111
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:36,420
energy and she had this religion.
This is the wrong person.

1112
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:38,400
There's another Nina's
story that's a singer

1113
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:46,470
who sings. You fucking
ruined her life. Audio clips,

1114
01:04:46,471 --> 01:04:48,570
lyrics,
concert schedule photos,

1115
01:04:48,571 --> 01:04:53,100
a style incorporating pop
alternative rock, jazz and soul.

1116
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:58,320
Say about it being used to have a dick.
Oh No,

1117
01:04:58,321 --> 01:05:00,120
I think it's a different person.

1118
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:05,460
Different person. Did you find it? Oh,
buck angel. Oh, what is that? Oh No,

1119
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:07,930
don't show me buck angels in large.
Cliteracy yeah.

1120
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:12,080
Large. Yes. It's quite funky. Okay,

1121
01:05:12,081 --> 01:05:14,990
I'm going to look up on the
storage to do that, don't you?

1122
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:18,070
It

1123
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:19,830
makes me uncomfortable.
Why?

1124
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:25,510
It makes it so don't be, don't be. But,

1125
01:05:25,511 --> 01:05:29,260
but that was what they both talked about.
It was that, and I don't blame them.

1126
01:05:29,261 --> 01:05:33,910
They said that they didn't want to go
with the full sexual transformation

1127
01:05:33,911 --> 01:05:38,830
because the propensity of losing your
orgasm with very high and he wants to lose

1128
01:05:38,831 --> 01:05:42,340
that, but how are you going to look
like a chick of you still have a duck?

1129
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:44,090
You know? I mean, you're going to,

1130
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:46,330
if you want to really be a woman
and pretend you're a woman,

1131
01:05:46,331 --> 01:05:47,410
you're going to have to give something up.

1132
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:51,430
Are you going to have to give up Shannon
loads called a man Jina shooting loads.

1133
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:56,290
Whenever I think of a woman, you know,
if a man wants to be considered a woman,

1134
01:05:56,291 --> 01:05:59,470
you can't have a deck. Okay? And
if you want us to call you Shane,

1135
01:05:59,471 --> 01:06:00,670
you know what's really funny,
you guys?

1136
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:02,950
I was tempted to tell my
parents to listen to this,

1137
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:07,300
listen to the previous to that
we did here, and I was like,

1138
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:11,220
I bet today's going to be different
because I feel like everything's cool.

1139
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:14,210
Educational. Really. You sure it's on

1140
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:21,640
a story. So we are sorry.
Need a story. No story.

1141
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:27,490
We're so sorry.
Please go support Nina story on iTunes.

1142
01:06:27,491 --> 01:06:32,190
Go buy her shit. We apologize, Nina.
Arceneaux I'm sure at your does.

1143
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:36,690
He does look like a crazy Barbie
doll type thing. Oh Jesus Christ.

1144
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:38,450
This silicone diaries.
Okay.

1145
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:42,470
That's what's really amazing is
the body language cause it's still,

1146
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:45,970
has she still moved like a dude?
Oh stop.

1147
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:50,100
She sat down like,

1148
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,350
well she said that because she said that
when she would open her legs to you,

1149
01:06:53,351 --> 01:06:57,190
that was her power energy coming
at you. Wow. Power Energy.

1150
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:06,860
Her metaphorical whole,
goodness.

1151
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:12,880
Goodness.
Joey Diaz and I were in Vegas once we,

1152
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:17,940
a transsexual showed us the package with
Mrs. Reagan was there as well and she

1153
01:07:18,611 --> 01:07:21,280
got a chance to look at it too.
And Joey said it best.

1154
01:07:21,281 --> 01:07:23,170
He said it looked like a
bat with its mouth open.

1155
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:29,260
It looked like someone had slammed and
apple core in this someone's cock cause

1156
01:07:29,261 --> 01:07:30,490
like you don't need that anymore.

1157
01:07:30,491 --> 01:07:35,170
Let me just sweep that bulge out and then
pull some ball skin over the hole and

1158
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:39,210
like stitch, it looked like an
empty hole where a dick used to be.

1159
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:43,420
Oh yeah dude.
And it's in the wrong spot to by the by.

1160
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:48,600
Have you ever noticed a time we'll fake
vaginas and they're more towards the

1161
01:07:48,671 --> 01:07:52,240
front. Then the real vagina, you
know, real vagina is sort of tucked,

1162
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,770
talked a little bit further
back. Vagina. Well Taste Jeffery,

1163
01:07:56,660 --> 01:08:00,640
a lot more salty.
What are you doing?

1164
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,900
Criminal. But you could show
that. Well that wasn't real.

1165
01:08:07,901 --> 01:08:09,790
It just looked like it
was something sexual,

1166
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:12,430
but it was just a dude
with his hand being silly.

1167
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:17,900
Maybe you guys can fucking exercise the
horrible feelings and thoughts in this

1168
01:08:17,901 --> 01:08:20,240
room and his sweep them
out of here with a song.

1169
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:25,190
He can't do that because this
conversation has gone dark, dark one.

1170
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:30,560
Well somehow or another
we started out with dogs.

1171
01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:33,770
It was like dog world dogs,
people we in on each other.

1172
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:37,970
I mean it's a quick,
but we can't,

1173
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:41,030
we got the school shootings I
think led us to a dark place.

1174
01:08:41,031 --> 01:08:45,650
Then we tried to recover with some
humor and actual doc. I'm exhausted.

1175
01:08:45,651 --> 01:08:48,860
Crazy. Got a little crazy when you
guys brought up the buck cherry.

1176
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:53,350
So buck also,
you guys are,

1177
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:59,850
I mean
you guys know Buck Cherry.

1178
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:02,490
I seen him don't know
him personally. Oh, okay.

1179
01:09:02,491 --> 01:09:07,440
You don't have like a buck cherry story.
I liked that cocaine song.

1180
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,320
I don't even, I've never even done
cocaine, but that song is great.

1181
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:14,680
It gets you got, yeah. Oh Man. He
loves the cocaine. You cocaine.

1182
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:17,070
The new thing is, is
liquid cocaine. I know.

1183
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:20,550
I've seen a lot of people having this
liquid cocaine where it's in like a,

1184
01:09:20,551 --> 01:09:25,300
like a nose spray thing and you just
spray it in your nose. No, wait. Yeah.

1185
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:29,490
That is crazy. And so it just looks
like no nasal looks like you're doing.

1186
01:09:29,491 --> 01:09:32,660
Like you just cleaning your nose
out. You're just doing it. Oh my God.

1187
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:36,720
These people just carry them around in
their purse and he was like, it's crazy.

1188
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:40,330
And I guess it's better also for you.
It's healthy.

1189
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:43,200
It's like cigarettes and good for you.

1190
01:09:43,201 --> 01:09:46,360
It's like the cigarette with a
fucking Stephen Dorff commercial.

1191
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:51,400
Guys, let's take back our
ability to do coke and public.

1192
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:57,700
Say Back our freedom. Have you seen
that commercial, Stephen Dorff?

1193
01:09:57,730 --> 01:10:00,580
Oh my God,
it is possibly.

1194
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:03,730
It possibly broke the Douche scale.

1195
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:07,210
It might've broken the Douche scale.
Brion pull it up please.

1196
01:10:07,211 --> 01:10:11,710
While we're waiting for beautiful
Suzanne to urinate. This is a video.

1197
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:14,860
Blue cigarettes,
Stephen Dorff commercial blue cigarettes.

1198
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:18,820
It is easily the Douchey has
commercial in the history of the world.

1199
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:22,600
He's in black and white. Okay.
And he smoked it an e cigarette.

1200
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:26,320
Take us freedom back, man.
Why was, what's his thing?

1201
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:30,490
How can we know Stephen Dorff?
He's, he was in bleed. Okay.

1202
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:34,600
Was that his breakout role? Not As,
I mean you did a lot of movies but,

1203
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:36,130
but he was in blade.

1204
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:39,370
I mean he was the fucking head
vampire and blade from there on.

1205
01:10:39,371 --> 01:10:43,730
It's been a downhill slide. And to the
point where no disrespect and he's like,

1206
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,770
well, goodbye fear factor guy. We're
just talking about reality here.

1207
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:50,660
Scientists don't get upset.
Know building.

1208
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,900
I probably would have done that commercial
to that cigarette commercial if they

1209
01:10:53,901 --> 01:10:58,360
paid me enough.
Who knows?

1210
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,820
But once you see it, he just like, whoa.

1211
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:05,560
You gotta be really unaware to write this,
to ask someone to do it.

1212
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:09,830
Forget about him. Look
at this. Oh wait, thesis.

1213
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,100
I'm tired of being a walk.
Brian, stop with the music.

1214
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:17,140
I'm tired of being a walk.
Walking Astrid.

1215
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:23,150
I'm tired of feeling guilty every
time I want to light up negative one.

1216
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,290
I'm tired of being a walking
asterik negative too.

1217
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:31,310
I'm tired of feeling guilty every time
I want to light up. I'm Steven door.

1218
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,340
I've been a smoker.

1219
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:35,640
Hold on. Pause the Suzanne
messages. You got to see this cause.

1220
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:40,650
Hurry up and sit down. The Stephen Dorff
cigarette commercial. Have you seen this?

1221
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:44,130
No, I haven't seen. I've seen the ads.
It's the Douchey is commercial. Oh,

1222
01:11:44,131 --> 01:11:44,964
you broke your leg.

1223
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:47,940
It's the Douchey as commercial
and the history of the human race.

1224
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:49,670
I don't think there's been
a douchey or commercial.

1225
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:52,500
It's for Stephen Dorff
for electric cigarettes.

1226
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:57,780
Okay. Juan, who? This? I'm tired of
being a walking ashtray negative too.

1227
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:01,800
I'm tired of feeling guilty every time
I want to light up. I'm Steven door.

1228
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:07,010
I'd been a smoker for 20 years and I
just found the smarter alternative blue.

1229
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:08,593
He says,

1230
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:13,070
blue lets me enjoy smoking without it
affecting the people around Malibu,

1231
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:19,370
not tobacco smoke.
That means no ash and best hall PLO.

1232
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:23,250
Offensive Odor.
We could smoke at the basketball game.

1233
01:12:23,251 --> 01:12:26,550
If you want to and how about not having
to go outside every 10 minutes when

1234
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:27,840
you're in a bar with your friends.

1235
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:33,210
The point is you can smoke blue
virtually anywhere. Oh, that's so dumb.

1236
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:36,570
Oh, I don't like us then. I don't
want to get it. [inaudible] I like,

1237
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:37,950
I like when we take our freedom.

1238
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:42,370
I like how it looks or play.
He paused away, looked at what?

1239
01:12:42,371 --> 01:12:46,960
Stop it with the music. You fuck. Okay,
look it up. I'm just like looking cool.

1240
01:12:46,961 --> 01:12:50,920
Black and white holds it out believable.
It broke to Douche bag scale.

1241
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:55,480
It literally broke the Douche scale. It's
black and white for no fucking reason.

1242
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:58,030
There's no reason for that.
It's an artistic choice.

1243
01:12:58,570 --> 01:13:02,830
I'm going to do this commercial, but I
want it to be already know fuck. I want,

1244
01:13:02,831 --> 01:13:05,260
I want to look like Jack Caraway
and to be honest with you,

1245
01:13:05,261 --> 01:13:08,860
I smoke electronic cigarettes because
there's nothing wrong with small then I

1246
01:13:08,861 --> 01:13:09,101
wouldn't,

1247
01:13:09,101 --> 01:13:12,100
I don't like to tell anyone or do it
in public because I'm unembarrassed.

1248
01:13:12,101 --> 01:13:13,110
But like I,

1249
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:17,140
I'm satisfied because I'm not smoking
regular cigarettes cause I love them,

1250
01:13:17,141 --> 01:13:20,190
but they're bad for me. Well, I don't
think electronic cigarettes, that was,

1251
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:25,410
that was one of the Douchey is
things I've ever been. I'm, and I'm,

1252
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,810
I feel like I need to take, I need
to take a time out. No, listen,

1253
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:32,440
I support the idea of electric cigarettes.

1254
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:36,400
It's not what the idea of electric
cigarettes, I totally support it.

1255
01:13:36,401 --> 01:13:39,060
But that approach,
the cool guy on the beach,

1256
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:42,850
someone should get up there and
be like, hey, I do this. But it's,

1257
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:47,880
it's pretty clean image that they're
trying to portray is like this man who's

1258
01:13:47,891 --> 01:13:49,000
like rugged with his,

1259
01:13:49,001 --> 01:13:53,950
like his stubble by the ocean
with like a Siemens jacket on.

1260
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:57,850
You know? I mean, he has this
fucking Jack Kerouac look to him.

1261
01:13:57,851 --> 01:14:01,000
Like he's going to go write the great
American novel and he's just so cool to be

1262
01:14:01,001 --> 01:14:04,630
around. Goes to the local bar and
they all know him by name. You know,

1263
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:07,790
buck angel like to smoke
cigarettes on them. Meanwhile,

1264
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:12,200
I'd like comes up the puck angels
pregnant, Stephen Dorff loved

1265
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:16,300
child. What if fucking you'll
go. I don't, I don't know.

1266
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:19,420
I don't know if it can work
anymore. Yeah. They would come out.

1267
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:22,660
It would be dragons.
That's where dragons come from.

1268
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:27,250
The societies figuring out how to turn
a man to a woman than a guy fucks it and

1269
01:14:27,251 --> 01:14:31,600
then it gets pregnant. A dragon is born.
I think I saw that in game of Thrones.

1270
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:35,930
Where is it? Chemo Thrones coming out in
March. It's isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Ooh,

1271
01:14:35,931 --> 01:14:37,930
you just made me excited about March.
I can't wait.

1272
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:43,170
[inaudible] the end of the
world can't come. It's, you
know what title I honestly,

1273
01:14:43,171 --> 01:14:46,710
I'm going to take back what I said
before, but what? I think we're okay.

1274
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:50,230
I think we're okay. I really
do. We're okay with just
the aliens are coming. Well,

1275
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:53,910
I think the only is already here. I
know. If you get in an isolation tank,

1276
01:14:53,911 --> 01:14:58,080
they'll talk to you. Did you? There's
that show. This is, I fucking love this.

1277
01:14:58,110 --> 01:14:59,250
I haven't seen it.
I don't even know.

1278
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:04,170
What's the show called on the neighbors
or something where it's about aliens and

1279
01:15:04,171 --> 01:15:06,780
they, they, they come to
life. No, they come to earth.

1280
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:10,130
That's what the dude from me are.
I'm not sure what all I know is Mike.

1281
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:14,550
My friend told me about it, and I
forgive me if I miss miss quote myself,

1282
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:19,890
but the show is about these aliens come
to earth and it looked like people and

1283
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,040
they don't have very,
uh,

1284
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:26,220
they don't have like substantial up to
date information on how to integrate

1285
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:30,810
themselves into the human society. They
have this like sports almanac from 1985,

1286
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:35,190
so they all give themselves names like
Jackie Joyner Kersee and like Larry Bird

1287
01:15:35,191 --> 01:15:36,480
and Kareem Abdul Jabbar,

1288
01:15:36,481 --> 01:15:39,600
and it's like a six year old white kid
and his name is Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

1289
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:42,690
I could be totally wrong.
I've, I've never seen the show,

1290
01:15:42,691 --> 01:15:44,700
but my friend was telling me about
it and I thought that was funny.

1291
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:45,770
That's kind of funny.
Yeah.

1292
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:46,271
Yeah.
That,

1293
01:15:46,271 --> 01:15:49,620
that's how the aliens come and six year
olds at pretend to be black athletes.

1294
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:55,440
Dude, I would, yeah, that's how I do
it. Confused the fuck out of everybody.

1295
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:59,580
Uh, before you guys get started, I
gotta give a shout out to the float lab.

1296
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:04,530
The float lab in Venice, California,
and the premiere isolation tank, uh,

1297
01:16:04,590 --> 01:16:08,040
people builders in the country,
they're there on the west coast.

1298
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:11,580
If you're ever in California, if you're
in San Francisco, oh, take a flight down.

1299
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:14,580
Trust me. You need to see what these
guys are doing there. They have like,

1300
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:17,280
they're taking isolation
tanks to the next level.

1301
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:20,460
They just installed a new one in
my basement this week. It's crazy.

1302
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:21,601
You got to come see it.

1303
01:16:21,601 --> 01:16:23,950
We've got to make a new video and
we'll that last video you, hey,

1304
01:16:23,990 --> 01:16:27,230
let's make a new one because this new
ones insane. And uh, I want to, um,

1305
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:31,860
take care of them. If you, uh, if you're
in Venice or anywhere near it and you can,

1306
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:32,730
you can get there.

1307
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:35,400
I think it's only like 40 bucks for an
hour and a half or something like that.

1308
01:16:35,401 --> 01:16:39,120
They're very reasonable and without a
doubt they have the best equipment on the

1309
01:16:39,121 --> 01:16:39,954
planet earth.

1310
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:45,050
This new one they put in my basement
is eight feet long and six feet wide to

1311
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,180
frank. Go in there, check it.
Yeah, you get get up a group.

1312
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:50,810
You get to have a party in
that bitch. Get Buck, buck,

1313
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:54,030
buck angel and Buck Cherry both together.

1314
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:58,350
If buck angel got
pregnant from Buck Cherry

1315
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:02,270
might be the apocalypse
if you had to be in the,

1316
01:17:02,271 --> 01:17:07,010
in the isolation tank with all of
them and Steven door. Yeah. Wow.

1317
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:09,980
Y'all crazy bitch bitch.
Fuck so good. A lot of top

1318
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:10,813
of it.

1319
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:19,040
Trying to be cool by the beach man. I'll
think what you're doing is cool at all.

1320
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,060
It's isolated. It's together.
Good for electronic cigarette.

1321
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:28,640
Try to be in a guilty but lighten up and
you could light up at a basketball game.

1322
01:17:28,641 --> 01:17:30,830
Cause you know me man.
I like to go to the game.

1323
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:33,470
Oh hang out with the guys have a beer.

1324
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:36,510
Why does your man vaginas
smelled like Jay Moore?

1325
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:39,560
What exactly the chain

1326
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:43,630
smell like?
Bookshare archangel

1327
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:48,080
by boat by the way. I'm a
buck cherry fan. Don't get it.

1328
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,770
Don't get it twisted right.
I love Buck Cherry.

1329
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:56,410
That crazy bitch song.
When I think about my ex girlfriends,

1330
01:17:56,411 --> 01:18:01,240
like all of them that they could play
like all my memories of every check that I

1331
01:18:01,241 --> 01:18:05,560
dated until I was like 26 and throw
them together with a buck cherry song.

1332
01:18:05,561 --> 01:18:09,580
That crazy bitch song. Just all the my
memories of every crazy one of them.

1333
01:18:09,581 --> 01:18:10,810
Splice them all together.

1334
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:15,430
So respect to Buckcherry
and respect to buck angel.

1335
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:20,170
Fuck it man. If you really feel like
you were a dude, fuck it. Get in there.

1336
01:18:20,171 --> 01:18:24,520
So I know you've done a great job of
looking exactly like a dude. You know,

1337
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:26,920
if you were in Jujitsu class,
I wouldn't want to roll with you.

1338
01:18:26,921 --> 01:18:27,754
You look quite big.

1339
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:33,700
I have to deal with that
kind of horsepower. Would
you shrimp out? I will do.

1340
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:37,010
I'll hit escape. Try to hip
escape. You know what we did on,

1341
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:39,710
on a Saturday night this
past weekend inside trim,

1342
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:44,000
we went to an amateur wrestling night
in Nashville. It was Friday night.

1343
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:46,190
That sounds awesome. Those
things. That was our second one.

1344
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,980
We went to one of the most
people in this past year,

1345
01:18:49,010 --> 01:18:52,490
like three months ago by default.
And it is a,

1346
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:56,840
it is an unbelievable thing. It's a
social experiment, right? It really is.

1347
01:18:56,930 --> 01:19:01,310
And it's a, for some reason
around like really big dudes.

1348
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:05,840
I like something happens to me where
like coagulating I think it is,

1349
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:09,050
I swear to God because I like,
okay,

1350
01:19:09,051 --> 01:19:11,900
one time I was in Las Vegas
with my whole family by the way,

1351
01:19:11,901 --> 01:19:13,670
because we all like to drink and gamble.
Um,

1352
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:18,650
and we were at the Rio and
it was Christmas time and
all of a sudden all these

1353
01:19:18,651 --> 01:19:21,320
Chippendale's came out with
Santa Claus and I was like,

1354
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:26,260
oh my God. And I got pulled onto the
stage and I couldn't do anything except go

1355
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:30,820
cause they picked me up
in there just to know big.

1356
01:19:30,821 --> 01:19:34,620
And I just kept touching their arms and
I was like, oh my God. Did you add your,

1357
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:36,490
your hormones start firing time.

1358
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,540
I'm a real, like I'm a real, I'm
a real personality kind of girl.

1359
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:42,830
So the whole thing.

1360
01:19:42,831 --> 01:19:47,831
I think just the actual visual is so
it's such a shock to my system of like a

1361
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:51,950
big dude. Right? He's like picking me
up in his shirts off and he's very,

1362
01:19:51,951 --> 01:19:55,870
he's hairless and greasy. But will
you willing to let it go and like,

1363
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:58,490
except the fantasy. Oh yeah.
It was a total fantasy.

1364
01:19:58,491 --> 01:20:01,860
Total Magic Mike on his mother
fucker. Yeah, I mean, and I dunno,

1365
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:04,370
in my mind he's probably hung
like a field mouse and I was fine.

1366
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:07,980
I'm just in your mind, rationalize
it. I was like, yeah, there's nothing.

1367
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:11,390
This is, this is all wrong.
It's all wrong. But there's
some in your personality,

1368
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:12,480
the big dude,

1369
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:16,710
I mean the big dude thing
is such a crazy phenomenon.

1370
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:20,460
So you could go into a parallel dimension
which could never be accessed again,

1371
01:20:20,461 --> 01:20:22,830
and those Chippendale's guys
could just run a train on you,

1372
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:25,410
but no one would ever know.
You'll be cool with that.

1373
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:28,900
As long as he can just let it go for like,
why it's not even a real,

1374
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:30,090
it doesn't even exist.

1375
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:33,600
And after it's over you go right back
to the moment we thought up that idea.

1376
01:20:33,601 --> 01:20:35,460
You're the only one with memory.
It's all good.

1377
01:20:35,710 --> 01:20:39,000
You know if we had some deep talks and
they held me afterwards I think I'd be

1378
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:39,511
cool with that.

1379
01:20:39,511 --> 01:20:42,810
Tough to find deep talks and the
Chippendale's guys and probably a lot of,

1380
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:44,970
and those guys are listening
to this podcast right now.

1381
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:49,270
Right now they're gone bro. Okay. If
you were in my shoes, fucking magic.

1382
01:20:49,271 --> 01:20:54,120
Mike fucking got me going.
I was into it but anymore I digress.

1383
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:55,860
And he wore,
we were at the,

1384
01:20:55,861 --> 01:20:59,580
we were at the amateur wrestling night
and there was one of those dudes and it

1385
01:20:59,581 --> 01:21:02,600
was like he was not
obviously he wasn't great.

1386
01:21:02,610 --> 01:21:07,300
A top choice muscle meat for me but he
was really interesting and there was

1387
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:11,970
three personality, I disagree, but
grade a top choice of muscle meat.

1388
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,190
How do you define that? Do
you have like, it's all like,

1389
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:19,920
but you're looking for like a
Brock Lesnar type character.

1390
01:21:19,921 --> 01:21:23,960
Like what is your grade A's?
Brock Lesnar, Brock Lesnar,

1391
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:25,350
a former UFC heavyweight champion.

1392
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:30,970
So I need some help with like
the Russian dude and rocky. Yeah.

1393
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:32,700
He looks like a viking.

1394
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:37,820
Like he looks like come here on a
boat with a fucking sword in his hand.

1395
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:42,810
[inaudible] page.
I'd probably cut your head off

1396
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:46,950
while he's, while he's fucking
you. It'd be like an experience.

1397
01:21:47,450 --> 01:21:50,990
This is so bad and I believe I was going
to tell my parents to listen to this,

1398
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,810
to Christ. They don't. I'm sorry honey.

1399
01:21:54,811 --> 01:21:58,350
We really apologize if you're
listening right now. We didn't.

1400
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:02,220
We didn't mean to paint her and such an
unfavorable light. This is all just play.

1401
01:22:02,221 --> 01:22:04,470
We're applying.
This is Internet Haymont and real life.

1402
01:22:04,471 --> 01:22:05,970
I would never talk to
your daughter like that.

1403
01:22:05,971 --> 01:22:09,990
She's a beautiful human being and I
respect it very much, but on the podcast,

1404
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:13,140
we've got to take our shots
for entertainment. Okay.

1405
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:17,700
And that's where the whole gang bang
run a train Chippendales in the parallel

1406
01:22:17,701 --> 01:22:20,490
dimension thing came from.
I don't want that to happen.

1407
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:22,290
I don't think Suzanne wants
that to happen either.

1408
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:26,320
But afterwards where they say,

1409
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:31,470
I don't think anybody knew what to do
because I was just like, wow. I was like,

1410
01:22:31,471 --> 01:22:35,820
I was high. I mean they picked me
up. Right. Is that feel good though?

1411
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:40,530
Kinda kinda tall.
That doesn't happen very often.

1412
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:45,390
I can manhandle you women want that shit.
That's your DNA crying out.

1413
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:48,600
So I do. Doesn't want the opposite
of God doesn't want to check her.

1414
01:22:48,601 --> 01:22:49,680
Carries them upstairs.

1415
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:53,910
Like we'll tell fuck for girl picks you
up and carries you upstairs to fuck you.

1416
01:22:53,911 --> 01:22:57,780
You're like, okay. You already
defeated how many guns that happen.

1417
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:03,540
I don't think it's ever happened to me
yet, but this is Rogan. Life was young.

1418
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:06,070
Things can happen.
People can you crazy?

1419
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:10,480
Yeah, but a man doesn't want
a woman, Karen. Right. Have
you ever had to do carry,

1420
01:23:10,481 --> 01:23:14,860
you met a girl rather carry you Ben?
I'm not in a sexual sense. Maybe. Uh,

1421
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:18,720
just around town. Just hopped on
a few backs, I think. Wow. Yeah.

1422
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:21,070
That's,
you gotta be really confident.

1423
01:23:21,071 --> 01:23:25,060
Someone has a fall backwards and
we'll get back to that stuff. I have.

1424
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,790
Especially when you grab people,
grabbing your ankles, holding you,

1425
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:32,880
and two more of your friends. He's a big
guy to more your friends. Yeah, he's,

1426
01:23:32,881 --> 01:23:35,160
he's locked up three people body to dot.

1427
01:23:35,170 --> 01:23:37,840
Although the w the lady was on
the small side, she was very tiny.

1428
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:40,510
What's the small side? A
hundred pounds. She probably,

1429
01:23:40,511 --> 01:23:42,400
she probably like a five tour.
That's a lot.

1430
01:23:42,401 --> 01:23:46,330
Something like that to add to a duty
dude. He's like your seven foot, bro. Wow.

1431
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:52,300
There's, there's some big humans
out there. It happened. Honey.

1432
01:23:52,301 --> 01:23:55,870
Honey, what are you gonna play for
us? What do you want to do? Excuse me?

1433
01:23:56,790 --> 01:24:01,780
What do Radiohead. Okay, and here we go.

1434
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:07,690
Yeah. No sadness. Cover,
uplift. Obviously.

1435
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:12,190
This is a song by Radiohead that we wrote.
You Ready?

1436
01:24:26,890 --> 01:24:27,723
Okay.

1437
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:34,620
We're just going to go with it yet.
We'll still Betty. Yeah. Is that okay?

1438
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:38,810
Is that okay bro? Bro,
Bro, here we go. Bitches.

1439
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:40,720
One more time too.
Yeah.

1440
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:42,723
Oh,

1441
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:59,190
used to be all right.
What happened?

1442
01:25:00,990 --> 01:25:03,350
The cat gets show Tom.

1443
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:22,553
Wow.

1444
01:25:58,550 --> 01:25:59,383
What happened?

1445
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:18,540
Fifties Ah,

1446
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,433
awesome.

1447
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:36,600
Then you cook this.

1448
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,980
That was fucking,

1449
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:52,520
that was really cool. Very cool.
Very different for you guys.

1450
01:27:53,170 --> 01:27:57,210
It's weird. I love it. I love it.
That's a really interesting guy.

1451
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:01,520
Take on that song too. Yeah. You know,
we, we haven't played that as a duo,

1452
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:04,720
which was oh really? Well we
played with my roommate, uh,

1453
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:07,760
this very talented musician,
Ben Lewis and he played,

1454
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:11,660
we did it a little trio style and
he played mandolin and things.

1455
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:14,180
So it was kind of,
it really sounded bluegrass.

1456
01:28:14,410 --> 01:28:16,370
Is it still scary if you guys make,

1457
01:28:16,371 --> 01:28:19,100
when you think like you guys
performed so much together?

1458
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:24,050
I would think you have almost like a sort
of an ESP and it comes to doing a song

1459
01:28:24,051 --> 01:28:26,720
together and you know how to like
ebb and flow with each other.

1460
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:30,410
Does it like when you like a song like
that we haven't done as a duo before and

1461
01:28:30,411 --> 01:28:33,430
you were just doing it because
you don't want it to suck you?

1462
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:40,610
No, but I mean, especially if you're
going to cover a fucking radio head song,

1463
01:28:40,611 --> 01:28:44,270
you want to, you want to like do it some
justice. I think that was like a B minus.

1464
01:28:44,271 --> 01:28:47,590
What'd you think? Oh that was great. Shut
the fuck up. Don't judge yourself. Okay.

1465
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:50,240
There you go. Right? I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. You sounded really good

1466
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:56,210
on the radio. Had they release all their
shit online, right? Did they do that?

1467
01:28:56,890 --> 01:28:58,670
They do. They do both now. They did.

1468
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,130
Well they did at least one of their
albums on I'm to, yeah, I think

1469
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:04,860
they were the first big band
to say name your price. Yeah.

1470
01:29:05,330 --> 01:29:08,900
Really? Yeah. Oh Wow.
So how do they do that?

1471
01:29:08,901 --> 01:29:11,600
They just say like you put up a paypal
account or something like that so you can

1472
01:29:11,601 --> 01:29:14,300
give us a buck or you can give us,
yeah,

1473
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:19,420
that makes you think if we do that we'll
make millions of dollars to quite there

1474
01:29:19,551 --> 01:29:22,830
yet. I don't know. Maybe we should try.

1475
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:25,550
Do you guys feel a buildup?

1476
01:29:25,870 --> 01:29:28,930
I feel like your crowds are getting larger
or your Twitter followers are getting

1477
01:29:28,931 --> 01:29:30,880
more. You're getting more
attention. Do you feel it?

1478
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:34,630
We're kind of cruising right now
because we're working on this record,

1479
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:38,070
so we haven't been going out much. We
haven't torn that much and it's, it's,

1480
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:42,460
it's not a lot way. It is a low cause
we're not, we're not touring. You're just,

1481
01:29:42,461 --> 01:29:46,210
there isn't the end creating new stuff.
Yeah. Yeah. Do you, um, when you do that,

1482
01:29:46,211 --> 01:29:49,600
how do you, do you take time off
the road and you just like say,

1483
01:29:49,601 --> 01:29:53,110
okay we have to set aside x
amount of weeks. Like how do you,

1484
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:55,620
how do you do it when you
decide you're going to,

1485
01:29:55,790 --> 01:30:00,470
we keep trying to set deadlines. No,
we're setting deadlines. Um, so we're,

1486
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:03,760
we're going to be recording by
late February, but we still,

1487
01:30:03,761 --> 01:30:05,320
we have a lot of work to do.
You know,

1488
01:30:05,321 --> 01:30:08,500
we have a lot of writing that we haven't
done yet and we've been, it's so funny.

1489
01:30:08,501 --> 01:30:12,190
Last time we were here we were doing the
Kickstarter stuff and in between we've

1490
01:30:12,191 --> 01:30:14,710
been making all the rewards,
all the people who donated.

1491
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:17,670
Oh, the videos. So Haikus, man.

1492
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:21,440
I tell you something that's hilarious.
It's been, it's been really, really good

1493
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:25,880
fun and a lot of work.
But like the,

1494
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:29,120
the actual, it's just the two of us,
like nobody's helping us with it,

1495
01:30:29,150 --> 01:30:33,500
which is really, really the
truth. And like each person,

1496
01:30:33,501 --> 01:30:35,840
like half, like, you know, 90% of them,

1497
01:30:35,841 --> 01:30:39,290
we don't know who they are and that it's
such a cool feeling. Like, you know,

1498
01:30:39,291 --> 01:30:43,880
someone gave us like people giving us
$500 or even $25, whatever the case is,

1499
01:30:43,881 --> 01:30:48,820
like a really amazing feeling. And then
like to write them, they're Haiku and,

1500
01:30:48,821 --> 01:30:53,210
and so like stuttering.
Well it's, it's really cool.

1501
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:56,600
I hear what you're saying. It was
fun, but we're almost done. Um,

1502
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:59,930
and we've got a couple of shows, you
know, things like that here in there.

1503
01:30:59,931 --> 01:31:00,980
But really we're just writing.

1504
01:31:01,410 --> 01:31:03,210
It's really cool.
And you know,

1505
01:31:03,211 --> 01:31:05,460
these people were always going to
have this connection with you now,

1506
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:10,450
you know? Yeah. It has been a good thing
to see. See all these names. Now we,

1507
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:14,830
we know the names too, like addresses
we can find. You know where you live.

1508
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:18,500
It's really bad ass when
you stop and think about it.

1509
01:31:18,690 --> 01:31:22,270
I just need to sleep on your
couch. It's so unusual. You know,

1510
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:25,870
I really stop and think about it. How
often does, does a band get to do that?

1511
01:31:25,871 --> 01:31:28,810
I mean the rolling stones
never got a chance to do that
when they were coming up.

1512
01:31:28,811 --> 01:31:30,610
You know who gets chance to do that?
No,

1513
01:31:30,611 --> 01:31:33,850
but they hung out with the hell's
angels and no big deal. Is that okay?

1514
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,480
That's a substitute we need to do is we
need to get a motorcycle gang behind us

1515
01:31:37,481 --> 01:31:41,410
and I think that's just like straight
to the tippy top that gets like people

1516
01:31:41,411 --> 01:31:42,910
stabbed.
You gotta be

1517
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:47,910
careful with that shit. I mean,
it's not so bad. Just kidding.

1518
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:49,400
I got

1519
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:51,320
jokes through.
This is kind of a weird,

1520
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:54,640
maybe terrible thing I got through the
airport. Security with a knife. Yes.

1521
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:58,160
Somebody else just told me the
exact same thing I did. I had,

1522
01:31:58,161 --> 01:31:59,980
I realized he was in my Jack and I said,

1523
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:03,710
fuck I do you carry a knife. 40
domestic. The gift. You're getting crazy.

1524
01:32:03,711 --> 01:32:05,970
It's a gift from out of town.
Maybe I have to shit on the fucker.

1525
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:09,060
When you're a jet, you're a jet
for life. Exactly. I will snap.

1526
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:13,300
Switched plays making a comeback. Yes.
I carry a knife on me all the time.

1527
01:32:13,301 --> 01:32:14,660
Do you really? Yeah. Wow.

1528
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:19,720
It's it, you know what, like when your
package is a really hard to open to them,

1529
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:22,970
you walk to your car,
you want to open something,

1530
01:32:22,971 --> 01:32:25,760
you got a little thread on your code.
Just listen.

1531
01:32:25,761 --> 01:32:28,430
Don't think I don't appreciate it.
If I was a chick that'd be armed as fuck.

1532
01:32:29,740 --> 01:32:30,431
You know,
I,

1533
01:32:30,431 --> 01:32:33,560
I didn't really think about it as
much until I moved to Nashville and I,

1534
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:38,210
I'm alone a lot of the time. So it's like,
nevermind. I'm fine. I'm totally armed.

1535
01:32:38,211 --> 01:32:41,370
I have a big dog. It's just
pulled their pants off. Dude,

1536
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:43,970
I'm fucking a lot of time.
When did you start?

1537
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:51,210
If from the beginning, oh, Suzanne,

1538
01:32:51,390 --> 01:32:52,223
please stop.

1539
01:32:54,450 --> 01:32:57,930
That's my giant only redneck
that sees you at the supermarket.

1540
01:32:58,180 --> 01:33:02,030
I want to fight to the death if I have
to, you know, like how your role, oh,

1541
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:05,740
you gotta do what you gotta
do. It's getting hard. Cool.
Living in Nashville is a

1542
01:33:05,850 --> 01:33:09,720
better, worse, different.
I, I'm going to say better.

1543
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:14,210
Better in the sense that,
uh, from, uh, you know, uh,

1544
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:17,940
I'm here to play music vibe.
Like you get so much more for your dollar.

1545
01:33:17,941 --> 01:33:19,140
It's a very affordable town.

1546
01:33:19,141 --> 01:33:24,141
There's incredible musicians on every
corner that are welcoming and inspiring

1547
01:33:26,191 --> 01:33:28,630
and helpful.
And like we,

1548
01:33:28,850 --> 01:33:33,630
we have all these friends that help us
with like just getting integrated and we,

1549
01:33:33,631 --> 01:33:37,830
um, I really like it. It's funny, I was,
I was telling Red van earlier, he's like,

1550
01:33:37,831 --> 01:33:41,250
how are you doing? And I was
like, you know, I'm great
and I love La. I really do.

1551
01:33:41,251 --> 01:33:43,620
But like the minute I got on the
10 and I was stuck in traffic,

1552
01:33:43,650 --> 01:33:47,880
I was in a foul mood really? Well,
yeah. I just like, I wanted to get here,

1553
01:33:47,881 --> 01:33:51,660
I want him to go pick up band across
town. And like, it was just, it was funny,

1554
01:33:51,690 --> 01:33:55,720
like it took so long to get
here. I left at 1230. Wow.

1555
01:33:56,250 --> 01:34:00,080
And I dunno, there's just something
about Nashville that I really, the, our,

1556
01:34:00,081 --> 01:34:02,910
our productivity, like your energy
you have, I have more energy.

1557
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:07,260
I go to the YMC a like four times a week,
I mean things or look at this,

1558
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:11,640
it's happening. So you have
more time, more time. Much
more time. But why is that?

1559
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:15,780
I'm used to so much slower there just
in general. And it's a smaller town.

1560
01:34:15,810 --> 01:34:20,460
There's not as many people. We know fewer
people you can get around easier. Yes.

1561
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:23,390
Ben Lives like a mile and a half
for me, which is nice. So again,

1562
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:24,510
you guys are moving to new place.

1563
01:34:24,511 --> 01:34:26,340
Why don't you move right next
door to each other. You're crazy.

1564
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:28,500
Why not create such a little community?

1565
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:33,320
Well you are right next door to
each other. Yeah, I mean we're, I,

1566
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:36,540
I couldn't tell you the last time I want
a day without seeing it like a whole

1567
01:34:36,541 --> 01:34:40,410
day. How's that feel? It feels
great. I think you're really great.

1568
01:34:41,310 --> 01:34:45,810
I think you're really funny and you're
so smart and talented and good looking

1569
01:34:46,630 --> 01:34:50,670
full on. Wow. Great Body.
Okay. You guys rolling?

1570
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:55,980
Beautiful. She's got ugly. Do you have to
resist that? Do you have to resist the,

1571
01:34:56,090 --> 01:34:58,070
I mean you think we should
talk about it for a long

1572
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:02,210
time to have to resist romantic urges?
I'm just,

1573
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:06,980
no conversation is going gay these days.
No need to have this conversation.

1574
01:35:07,510 --> 01:35:11,120
Ben's revisiting his life.
It's odd though to, to have a,

1575
01:35:11,121 --> 01:35:16,121
a man woman sort of equal partnership
like this in a band that works and nobody

1576
01:35:16,251 --> 01:35:20,270
winds up cam pregnant. Oh my God,
God, I'm so not ready for that.

1577
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:25,940
You know? I mean you guys are like
bandmates really good friends.

1578
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:26,933
It's a,

1579
01:35:26,990 --> 01:35:29,960
that's a weird position for a man or a
woman to be like really good friends,

1580
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:32,310
isn't it?
In this day and age it's very happy.

1581
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:34,990
You know,
it's diff.

1582
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:39,100
It's difficult in a lot of
different ways because you know,

1583
01:35:39,490 --> 01:35:44,250
for the significant others that we date.
Yeah.

1584
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:49,270
That's like a, that's a big
one too. Cause we're so close.

1585
01:35:49,271 --> 01:35:54,250
I mean we and creativity together
is a very intimate thing. So, um,

1586
01:35:54,310 --> 01:35:56,200
you know, it's, it's a,

1587
01:35:56,201 --> 01:35:59,380
it's a rough road being a musician in
general because like you either date

1588
01:35:59,381 --> 01:36:03,520
someone in your band or you date someone
not in your band that you never see or

1589
01:36:03,521 --> 01:36:07,030
you're with someone that you see
every day. There's like this like

1590
01:36:07,330 --> 01:36:11,320
fine line. Do you ever, did you ever date
a guy? He's like, the fucking Ben Guy.

1591
01:36:11,470 --> 01:36:15,320
Never know. And that would be
ridiculous. That would be like, oh,

1592
01:36:15,910 --> 01:36:18,670
why would I want to date someone who
didn't like my best friend and be like,

1593
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:22,910
yeah,
unless he was a Chippendale,

1594
01:36:23,470 --> 01:36:27,240
I might make some reparations.
Yeah, she was a child.

1595
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:29,080
Just those guys from that night.

1596
01:36:29,081 --> 01:36:32,170
If you can just relay it to be short
lived relationship, let me tell you.

1597
01:36:32,171 --> 01:36:34,080
Oh listen, that's what you're looking
for. What are you trying to do?

1598
01:36:34,090 --> 01:36:37,300
Trying to fix the world. Trying to have
a good time. Okay. What are you gonna do?

1599
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:40,510
Establish a Topia.
I start a new community.

1600
01:36:40,511 --> 01:36:43,240
Know you can get your freak out
with a bunch of fucking shave dudes.

1601
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:47,090
That's the problem.
A little baby oil and a big party.

1602
01:36:47,470 --> 01:36:51,940
The smell of Suntan lotion
in the air, right? God,

1603
01:36:51,941 --> 01:36:55,450
it's so funny. Like shavers, all
of the fellows. How does that,

1604
01:36:55,630 --> 01:36:59,170
I'm white as goat cheese. This
is just like, it's amazing.

1605
01:36:59,171 --> 01:37:02,910
I couldn't get a tan to say my
life. No, I've tried it didn't,

1606
01:37:02,980 --> 01:37:07,870
it didn't work out well.
Nothing. We're gone burn. I
burn. Yeah. You have dark hair?

1607
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:12,130
I do, yeah. What is your
nationality? Italian. I'm a,

1608
01:37:12,131 --> 01:37:16,900
I'm a papa side and my mom is native
American, Indian and European, Huh. Yeah.

1609
01:37:17,130 --> 01:37:20,440
So I'm going to live forever and
be an alcoholic. Hello. Kidding.

1610
01:37:20,830 --> 01:37:22,970
It was not the case like the,

1611
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:27,280
do you find it runs in your community?

1612
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:31,900
Absolutely. Yeah. I mean gift court, first
of all, who's family? I want to know.

1613
01:37:31,901 --> 01:37:36,460
It doesn't have alcoholism
but boring people.

1614
01:37:36,510 --> 01:37:39,750
But I mean it's, it's true. Like

1615
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:44,840
every, every culture has their
physical relationship to it. Um,

1616
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:47,940
genetically speaking. Um,
and I believe that the,

1617
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:51,050
I'm a lightweight as much as
I love to drink. Like I'm,

1618
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:54,890
I'm kinda good after two drinks,
I'm pretty warm. I, my voice,

1619
01:37:54,891 --> 01:37:59,310
my gets louder. Um, you know,
I start taking my clothes off.

1620
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:04,410
That was a lie. Um, uh, in,

1621
01:38:04,411 --> 01:38:07,380
in the most fucking classy kind of way.
Bros,

1622
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:12,060
that's all I know about that for the most
class. You kind of way period. But um,

1623
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:15,600
anyway, yeah, I hope, I hope that I
said that well and it was not offensive.

1624
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:18,400
Do you find is easy to
make friends in Nashville?

1625
01:38:18,401 --> 01:38:22,210
You guys like meeting
people and enjoy it warm?

1626
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:25,580
It's an unusual town. Isn't
it? Yeah. And it's so, it's,

1627
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:30,760
I never realized how huge Ellie was until
you go to Nashville and it really is a

1628
01:38:30,761 --> 01:38:33,040
small town.
Like we'd go out,

1629
01:38:33,070 --> 01:38:35,500
we were there two weeks and he'd go out
and you're seeing people that should

1630
01:38:35,501 --> 01:38:36,660
know,
um,

1631
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:39,460
and you can get across town in 15 minutes
and everybody's just kinda wants to

1632
01:38:39,461 --> 01:38:44,290
hang. It's like a big sitting on the
porch beer drinking community. Yeah.

1633
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:45,220
It's like,

1634
01:38:45,310 --> 01:38:49,510
I think that when towns get too big and
there's a lot of great things about La,

1635
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:50,230
there's a lot of,

1636
01:38:50,230 --> 01:38:53,230
I mean there's so many great
restaurants are so many places to go.

1637
01:38:53,710 --> 01:38:58,060
All my friends live here. I love
La, but I really like smaller towns.

1638
01:38:58,090 --> 01:39:03,010
I really loved living in Boulder.
I really love Portland. I know,

1639
01:39:03,011 --> 01:39:07,480
I really love Nashville, Nashville span
ass. And there's like, um, a better vibe.

1640
01:39:07,510 --> 01:39:10,750
There's like, like, oh, the
frequency in the air is less intense.

1641
01:39:10,751 --> 01:39:14,290
It's not death metal. It's like fucking
piano music. You know what I mean?

1642
01:39:14,291 --> 01:39:19,180
It's like you can relax a little, like
the frequency of the actual city itself.

1643
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:23,410
You go to New York. Okay. New York is,
it's red line. Everywhere you go on,

1644
01:39:26,570 --> 01:39:27,450
there's too many people.

1645
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:31,000
No way to avoid that. It's a
crazy fucking town. You could,

1646
01:39:31,030 --> 01:39:35,560
you could take you an hour to drive
across that stupid island, you know,

1647
01:39:35,561 --> 01:39:39,950
a whole hour easily, easily, which
should take you a minute, you know,

1648
01:39:39,970 --> 01:39:43,090
just take you one minute,
I tell you.

1649
01:39:43,150 --> 01:39:46,330
So that kind of stress is going to
definitely affect people socially and you

1650
01:39:46,331 --> 01:39:49,600
don't get that in like a place like
Nashville. And that in itself is better.

1651
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:55,030
And I ended, it feels like the pace of
everything is slower so you can get more,

1652
01:39:55,210 --> 01:39:57,340
I dunno if you take advantage of it,

1653
01:39:57,341 --> 01:40:01,900
you can get more accomplished because
there's not this constant scurrying,

1654
01:40:01,930 --> 01:40:04,370
but you feel like you have to, or at least
I haven't felt like I had to do in La.

1655
01:40:05,150 --> 01:40:07,270
It was like get to hear, get to
hear. Good to hear, good to hear.

1656
01:40:07,271 --> 01:40:09,550
And then nothing would actually
come with any of these. No,

1657
01:40:09,630 --> 01:40:12,820
I feel that I feel that
constant scoring you. You know,

1658
01:40:12,970 --> 01:40:14,770
I've had friends like Eddie Bravo,

1659
01:40:14,771 --> 01:40:18,970
he used to live in west Hollywood and he
liked living in West Hollywood because

1660
01:40:18,971 --> 01:40:23,530
he felt like when he lived there the
pace was like a faster pace because

1661
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:24,760
everyone is doing things.

1662
01:40:24,761 --> 01:40:26,740
It made him feel like you had
to get up and get things done.

1663
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:30,900
That's the last shit I need.
You know, I do not want it.

1664
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:31,781
Well it's kind of like a,

1665
01:40:31,781 --> 01:40:34,630
you have to get up and get things done
and then you can't get there on time

1666
01:40:34,631 --> 01:40:39,520
cause you have to wait. That's
a difficult thing to, to digest.

1667
01:40:39,610 --> 01:40:41,980
Do you guys do any wean covers?
No.

1668
01:40:41,981 --> 01:40:44,270
We talked about piss up a
rope last time we were here.

1669
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:50,080
Where did she when you were two cheese go.
Oh that's great.

1670
01:40:50,081 --> 01:40:54,010
I love cheese. I love cheese.
You know it's a sad thing about

1671
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:54,460
cheese.

1672
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:59,460
Oh no Joe don't tell him fucking
country people are not allowed to use

1673
01:41:02,110 --> 01:41:03,880
unpasteurized milk to make cheese.

1674
01:41:04,030 --> 01:41:07,870
You have to pasteurize the
milk and homogenize it and
boil it down and kill all

1675
01:41:07,871 --> 01:41:11,440
the stuff that makes the cheese tastes
good. You ever have cheese in Europe?

1676
01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:14,530
Kind of cheese in France.

1677
01:41:14,830 --> 01:41:19,370
You have some non homogenized cheese
and France from an old like the

1678
01:41:19,410 --> 01:41:20,170
cheesemaker.

1679
01:41:20,170 --> 01:41:23,110
Some mother fucker really
knows what they're doing and
you can get it in America.

1680
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:23,980
I mean don't get me wrong,

1681
01:41:23,981 --> 01:41:28,210
there's places and we used to
get some really delicious cheese.

1682
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:30,460
Um,
there's a place in Beverly hills,

1683
01:41:30,461 --> 01:41:32,770
it's like it's a straight cheese
place and I know they probably,

1684
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:36,450
it's probably like a Cuban cigars sort of
a thing. Like you can get Cuban cigars,

1685
01:41:36,470 --> 01:41:37,330
be got to know people,

1686
01:41:37,331 --> 01:41:40,780
they're going to know you first and then
they slip you the non homogenized non

1687
01:41:40,781 --> 01:41:45,490
pasteurized cheese access in Los Angeles.
Do you ever have a raw milk?

1688
01:41:45,491 --> 01:41:49,710
Do you ever drink raw milk?
It's delicious and it's so good.

1689
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:54,640
It's just okay. Raw milk with
cookies. You cannot go wrong. Warm.

1690
01:41:54,641 --> 01:41:59,620
A little curt with some bad ass fucking
straight from the teeth getting on the

1691
01:41:59,621 --> 01:42:04,330
lap of an elderly man. Cubic cares if
you get some bad ass cookies. Okay.

1692
01:42:04,331 --> 01:42:08,080
Some really good like Nestle's tollhouse
type bitches. Like what does that,

1693
01:42:08,110 --> 01:42:08,980
what does that would,

1694
01:42:08,981 --> 01:42:11,710
that place of the airport where you
go to [inaudible] house, cookies.

1695
01:42:12,210 --> 01:42:17,050
Botches type of honeypot. What is
the fucking no nuts in them on the,

1696
01:42:17,051 --> 01:42:21,460
um, those cookies. There
was like the, there's like a
fucking famous cookie chain.

1697
01:42:21,620 --> 01:42:26,490
There are amazing cookies. Got,
I can't remember famous name now.

1698
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:30,070
Older neighbors are pretty good, but
there's like cookies. He get like,

1699
01:42:30,071 --> 01:42:35,050
they're always at the middle. Mrs
Field. Yesterday you go Mrs. Fields,

1700
01:42:36,610 --> 01:42:40,450
take a few of those
chocolate chips and you know what?

1701
01:42:40,450 --> 01:42:43,180
I'm going to find them as this
fields in this area in Pasadena,

1702
01:42:43,420 --> 01:42:46,510
and we're going to go there after this
fucking show. I need some cookies.

1703
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:49,120
You can't go. You gotta get the Hollywood
look. What's happening? How are you like,

1704
01:42:49,180 --> 01:42:52,430
oh my, my comedy special comes out
tomorrow, Ladies and gentlemen. Uh,

1705
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:56,710
tomorrow it comes out on Joe rogan.net.
If you go to Joe rogan.net,

1706
01:42:57,100 --> 01:43:00,550
it's a available, we were having a
problem with the Amazon thing. It's, um,

1707
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:02,440
it was supposed to be ready today,
but it's not.

1708
01:43:02,441 --> 01:43:05,380
So hopefully it will be ready by tomorrow,
but if not the paypal thing,

1709
01:43:05,381 --> 01:43:08,260
we'll definitely still be ready.
I like it to be ready with Amazon.

1710
01:43:08,261 --> 01:43:10,780
So you could do that one click,
which is awesome by the way.

1711
01:43:10,810 --> 01:43:14,870
I'm a huge Amazon one click proponent.
Um,

1712
01:43:15,010 --> 01:43:17,650
so it'll be on Joe rogan.net.
It'll be there too.

1713
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:21,520
That's what it's gonna look
like. You know, you got to
enter in all your nonsense.

1714
01:43:21,521 --> 01:43:26,420
And the, uh, the special something that
I, I paid for it entirely myself, uh,

1715
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:30,340
Louis C K style. I did a
essentially exactly what he did. Um,

1716
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:33,150
I'm releasing it for five bucks.
Uh,

1717
01:43:33,220 --> 01:43:36,730
I think what he did like by setting
that price, it's like really smart.

1718
01:43:36,731 --> 01:43:39,120
I think it's really cool.
And you know, Louise,

1719
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:42,790
one of the best comics in the country,
why would you ask for more? Don't put,

1720
01:43:42,830 --> 01:43:46,510
don't be plants and how to stop that
shit. I know what it is. It's my show,

1721
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:49,840
but it's available, uh, tomorrow. Um,

1722
01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:51,980
and then there's like a whole
thing that I paid for it.

1723
01:43:51,981 --> 01:43:53,750
And please don't steal it.
You know,

1724
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:58,400
of course certain people are
going to steal it. You're
going to, but uh, it's, uh,

1725
01:43:58,460 --> 01:44:01,550
I think it's a reasonable
price. I think, uh,

1726
01:44:01,850 --> 01:44:05,180
I think this sort of model like what we
were talking about with Radiohead would

1727
01:44:05,181 --> 01:44:09,020
they did and allowing people to pick
their own, I think stop playing my shit,

1728
01:44:09,021 --> 01:44:13,700
dude. I wasn't playing city. It's
kind of cool to look at the quality.

1729
01:44:13,701 --> 01:44:15,440
It's dare you know,
it's great.

1730
01:44:15,441 --> 01:44:19,390
Positive image video did it at the same
people that produce the UFC shows. Um,

1731
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,020
and my friend Anthony Giordano,

1732
01:44:21,050 --> 01:44:24,260
he's the director of it and he's the one
who did my last one talking monkey's in

1733
01:44:24,261 --> 01:44:26,750
space too. And uh, we, you know,

1734
01:44:26,751 --> 01:44:29,180
I'm real excited to do it this
way for a couple reasons. One,

1735
01:44:29,181 --> 01:44:32,210
I think it's the best
way to distribute things,

1736
01:44:32,211 --> 01:44:35,540
to distribute them online and to do it
directly to your fans instead of having

1737
01:44:35,541 --> 01:44:38,780
to go through comedy central or
any of these other, for comic,

1738
01:44:38,781 --> 01:44:42,320
like to have an outlet to
release your stuff. There's,
there's only a few options.

1739
01:44:42,321 --> 01:44:45,580
You could do an HBO thing or
a showtime thing or I know,

1740
01:44:45,581 --> 01:44:49,040
and like unfortunately you have to
actually sit down with people when you do

1741
01:44:49,041 --> 01:44:52,550
that and they have to decide what you,
what they like about your material,

1742
01:44:52,551 --> 01:44:56,630
what they don't like and that
shit, that shit is whack. Okay.

1743
01:44:56,631 --> 01:45:00,650
That is like the worst thing about being
a comedian is when you go to release

1744
01:45:00,651 --> 01:45:05,450
your stuff and there's other people that
have a say or want to have a saying in

1745
01:45:05,451 --> 01:45:09,560
the actual content. It's
crazy. It's that. It's the,

1746
01:45:09,710 --> 01:45:14,300
they're the dumbest conversations I've
had. People get upset at the dumbest shit.

1747
01:45:14,630 --> 01:45:18,920
It's, it's really, it's, it's mind
boggling and it's unnecessary.

1748
01:45:19,130 --> 01:45:24,090
And I think one of the things that
is really important about art is a,

1749
01:45:24,110 --> 01:45:25,220
whether it's,
um,

1750
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:30,080
a standup comic or someone who writes
something or whatever it is. I love,

1751
01:45:30,130 --> 01:45:32,660
uh,
an individual's unique point of view.

1752
01:45:32,690 --> 01:45:36,290
I love seeing the way a person
puts it together. You know,

1753
01:45:36,291 --> 01:45:40,700
whether it's perfect or not, if
it comes from you. I liked that.

1754
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:43,190
I liked knowing that you
wrote all your jokes.

1755
01:45:43,191 --> 01:45:46,490
I like knowing that you thought all
these thoughts that you printed all those

1756
01:45:46,491 --> 01:45:50,990
words. I want to be connected with
your, your thoughts, your creativity,

1757
01:45:50,991 --> 01:45:51,830
your consciousness.

1758
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:56,150
And the only way to do that is for a
person to release their own shit. Period.

1759
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:56,691
You know,

1760
01:45:56,691 --> 01:46:00,080
whether it's a band released their own
shit or a comedian to release their own

1761
01:46:00,081 --> 01:46:03,860
shit. As soon as you have some executive
type characters interfering with your

1762
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:07,550
creative process, you're fucked.
You know, you just are, they,

1763
01:46:07,551 --> 01:46:10,790
that's not what they're supposed to be
doing. But when they can, they will,

1764
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:13,850
they get their dirty little
greasy fingers, all of your shit,

1765
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:19,460
and they fuck it up inevitably. And uh,
I guess that's not necessary anymore.

1766
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:22,670
Um, because of, uh, this podcast,

1767
01:46:22,671 --> 01:46:27,590
we've essentially cut out doing most radio
shows. I mean a occasionally do radio,

1768
01:46:27,830 --> 01:46:30,470
but it's not like every week. Like
I used to have to do it. It's,

1769
01:46:30,471 --> 01:46:32,780
I don't have to do as
many different interviews.

1770
01:46:32,780 --> 01:46:36,650
You can talk directly to the
people that enjoy what you do.

1771
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:39,950
And this is, these are
crazy times, you know,

1772
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:43,880
this podcast alone has
changed my life chains.

1773
01:46:43,881 --> 01:46:46,460
Brian's life changed Ari's alive.
Duncan's life.

1774
01:46:46,461 --> 01:46:50,970
Joey's life changed all our lives.
We're, we're in a weird place right now.

1775
01:46:51,180 --> 01:46:51,900
And,
uh,

1776
01:46:51,900 --> 01:46:55,080
I think the only smart thing to do is
just keep going in the same direction.

1777
01:46:55,081 --> 01:47:00,081
That's why I got this new studio set up
and that's why were releasing things on

1778
01:47:00,171 --> 01:47:00,841
line like this.

1779
01:47:00,841 --> 01:47:04,050
And that's why we're all touring and
we're all continuing to write material.

1780
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,150
And you're special by the way,
is outright now.

1781
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:08,910
You could actually buy it this second,
right? This is right second. Yeah.

1782
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:11,490
I'm not supposed to say that because
they're trying to get everything in order,

1783
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:15,270
especially get the Amazon Shit corrected.
But if you want to get crazy,

1784
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:19,600
go ahead and buy it. Download it. It's
supposed to be up. Yeah, I mean, again,

1785
01:47:19,650 --> 01:47:23,070
like I said it and don't say sorry. You
didn't know. How did you know? Uh, yeah,

1786
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:24,300
but tomorrow it's official.

1787
01:47:24,330 --> 01:47:27,840
So wait for tomorrow if you'd like
fucking opening up your presence in the

1788
01:47:27,841 --> 01:47:32,340
morning. If you want to list those
dudes is still believes in Santa.

1789
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:35,880
Wait until tomorrow. Okay. If not, yeah,
you can go fucking get it right now.

1790
01:47:36,150 --> 01:47:39,180
Five Bucks, please don't steal it.
Okay. I paid for the shit constantly.

1791
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:42,960
More than a hundred thousand dollars
to film. It's very expensive, but,

1792
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:46,140
well you did professional style.
Yeah, no, I didn't fuck around.

1793
01:47:46,141 --> 01:47:48,300
And we did it at the
Tabernacle in Atlanta,

1794
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:52,710
which is a beautiful historic theater.
It's an amazing, amazing theater.

1795
01:47:53,010 --> 01:47:56,010
And uh, it was important for, I haven't
been to Atlanta and a couple of years,

1796
01:47:56,011 --> 01:48:00,390
so it was important to do it somewhere
where I hadn't been for a while to cover,

1797
01:48:00,391 --> 01:48:02,880
you know, to I, I don't,

1798
01:48:02,881 --> 01:48:05,850
I hate getting emails from people
like wouldn't fuck you coming back to

1799
01:48:05,851 --> 01:48:09,060
Vancouver. Trust me, I want to come
back to Vancouver. I just don't,

1800
01:48:09,061 --> 01:48:12,240
I haven't had a chance. So that
was an Atlanta sort of a situation.

1801
01:48:12,241 --> 01:48:15,750
So it was really cool to be able to
do it in Atlanta. And Atlanta is a,

1802
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:18,960
does not get enough credit.
That is a bad ass fucking town.

1803
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:24,140
I love Atlanta and it's one of the like
the most diverse like racially diverse

1804
01:48:24,991 --> 01:48:25,824
towns,

1805
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:29,430
Atlanta's miles places where you see
like a lot of black dudes wearing suits.

1806
01:48:29,790 --> 01:48:33,720
Like a lot of like eight or shoes. Yeah,
like expensive clothes and you know,

1807
01:48:33,830 --> 01:48:35,700
driver like it's weird thing.

1808
01:48:35,701 --> 01:48:39,000
It's like there's a lot of like
black professionals in Atlanta.

1809
01:48:39,030 --> 01:48:40,920
It's like the uh,

1810
01:48:40,950 --> 01:48:44,220
the level of interaction between
white people and black people.

1811
01:48:44,221 --> 01:48:48,900
It's way higher in Atlanta.
And uh, that's, that's a
fucking real problem with La.

1812
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:53,220
You know, I'll, La is first of all like
kind of segregate and second of all,

1813
01:48:53,221 --> 01:48:56,040
it's such a car culture
that people don't really,

1814
01:48:56,041 --> 01:48:57,630
it's not like on the subways in New York,

1815
01:48:57,631 --> 01:49:01,380
people will mingle black people mixed with
white people. Everybody gets together,

1816
01:49:01,381 --> 01:49:04,710
people from different, all sorts of
different economic groups are altogether.

1817
01:49:04,860 --> 01:49:07,380
That's in La.
That's not the case in la.

1818
01:49:07,381 --> 01:49:09,210
There's like a lot of haves and have nots.

1819
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:12,390
It's a lot of separation
and everyone's driving,

1820
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:15,990
so no one's like on a train
with a bunch of young kids.

1821
01:49:16,110 --> 01:49:21,030
So it's different sort of a vibe. I think
we miss out because of that. You know,

1822
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:23,910
the idea that, you know,
he'd get a little more,

1823
01:49:23,911 --> 01:49:28,680
a little less crime that way and you know,
it's a little safer that way,

1824
01:49:28,681 --> 01:49:32,340
but you miss out on a little bit of the
whole experience of being a human and

1825
01:49:32,341 --> 01:49:37,220
Atlanta. It's a slot, a lot
of mixing going on. It was
cool. You know, I liked it.

1826
01:49:37,221 --> 01:49:41,490
So a lot of black guys with white
checks, a lot of that. So a lot of that.

1827
01:49:42,090 --> 01:49:44,820
I saw her, a bunch of white dudes
of black chicks too. It was,

1828
01:49:44,821 --> 01:49:47,130
it was an interesting place.
I dig Atlanta,

1829
01:49:47,170 --> 01:49:51,370
but it was a really cool place to
my special jackals. Great. Yeah,

1830
01:49:51,430 --> 01:49:52,990
it's pretty dope.
And that's the name of the special,

1831
01:49:53,230 --> 01:49:55,440
it's live from the tabernacle because a,

1832
01:49:55,441 --> 01:49:57,460
I'm not that creative and I
couldn't come up with a better name.

1833
01:49:58,090 --> 01:50:02,230
That's all I had in my wheel
house. I searched, I found nothing.

1834
01:50:02,310 --> 01:50:07,240
I decided to just release it. So talk from
talking monkey's in space to live from

1835
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:10,900
the last one I ran out of my good names.

1836
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:15,190
Do you do once he released his specialty,
stopped doing that material? Why? Yeah.

1837
01:50:15,191 --> 01:50:18,310
I mean maybe a rare occasion
if someone yell something out,

1838
01:50:18,311 --> 01:50:21,550
I will do it just for fun,
you know? But it's over. Yeah.

1839
01:50:21,551 --> 01:50:25,050
I've got to let that shit go. Move on
to the next material. That's why, uh,

1840
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:27,940
first of all it's what people are like,
why did it take so long to release this?

1841
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:30,220
Because we filmed it on
four 20 in the April.

1842
01:50:30,940 --> 01:50:34,960
So part of it took that time because I
had a new website that just went live

1843
01:50:34,961 --> 01:50:38,800
last week and it takes a long time to
get like a professional website design

1844
01:50:38,801 --> 01:50:40,960
company to build like
exactly what you want.

1845
01:50:40,961 --> 01:50:45,640
And you know that just the website traffic
has been so crazy that it's gotten to

1846
01:50:45,641 --> 01:50:48,730
a point where I needed something that
was like a little bit more robust and a

1847
01:50:48,731 --> 01:50:53,080
little bit more functional
and then incorporating the
podcast into it. And we're,

1848
01:50:53,081 --> 01:50:56,860
we're working on a totally new podcast
website now and that's like the next step.

1849
01:50:57,310 --> 01:51:01,270
But it's, it's the whole
podcast thing is just, it's,

1850
01:51:01,271 --> 01:51:04,600
it's gotten so out of control. It's
almost like, I don't know how Brian,

1851
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:06,130
if you feel about the same way I do,

1852
01:51:06,131 --> 01:51:10,510
but I always feel like we're like on a
fucking little boat on top of some crazy

1853
01:51:10,511 --> 01:51:15,040
wave. And we're like, Whoa,
what do we need to do? We need
for a fucking rafts. Okay,

1854
01:51:15,041 --> 01:51:19,330
let's get rafts. You know, like when
we, when we buy shit for the studio,

1855
01:51:19,331 --> 01:51:21,890
it's always like, what do we need?
Oh, I need more of this shit.

1856
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:22,930
We need more of that shit.

1857
01:51:22,931 --> 01:51:26,470
And it just seems to be kind of grown on
its own and we're just kind of keeping

1858
01:51:26,471 --> 01:51:30,320
up with it. You know, this is
a part of it. So, you know,

1859
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:34,330
these shows that we do, uh, when
I, whenever I ask people like,

1860
01:51:34,331 --> 01:51:37,840
how many guys listen to the
podcast? It, what about a year end?

1861
01:51:38,170 --> 01:51:43,120
It was about 50% and now it's like a
hundred percent. Now it's crazy. And, uh,

1862
01:51:43,540 --> 01:51:47,200
we're having the fucking time of our
lives. I just want to tell you guys,

1863
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:50,590
as much as you, people are
enjoying it, we get these emails,

1864
01:51:50,591 --> 01:51:52,690
we get these tweets and texts messages.

1865
01:51:52,690 --> 01:51:57,690
I get these emails every day that tell
people or are people telling us rather

1866
01:51:58,361 --> 01:52:02,230
that the podcast has changed their life
and change the way they think about

1867
01:52:02,231 --> 01:52:06,430
things and the conversations we've had
with people like Dennis Mckenna yesterday,

1868
01:52:06,700 --> 01:52:11,080
I talked to a guy today who told me
listen to it five times already came out

1869
01:52:11,081 --> 01:52:15,160
yesterday. You know, it's like, it
was such a crazy fucking conversation.

1870
01:52:15,670 --> 01:52:20,290
We are just as you are, we're growing
with these conversations as well.

1871
01:52:20,291 --> 01:52:21,520
There's no other way.

1872
01:52:21,521 --> 01:52:24,910
Brian and I would have had the opportunity
to sit down with all these people and

1873
01:52:24,911 --> 01:52:25,990
have these conversations with them.

1874
01:52:25,991 --> 01:52:28,990
They wouldn't just be willing to come
meet us somewhere and sit down for three

1875
01:52:28,991 --> 01:52:33,490
hours a day if I was just subdued
and lived in a castle somewhere.

1876
01:52:33,700 --> 01:52:36,640
But I need to converse with this man,
bring him to me.

1877
01:52:37,690 --> 01:52:39,800
The only way you can really have a,
a car,

1878
01:52:39,860 --> 01:52:42,760
it has to be worthwhile for them to so
they can get their message out. So it's,

1879
01:52:42,761 --> 01:52:47,000
this whole thing has been a
real symbiotic exchange. So, uh,

1880
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:50,660
when you guys, I can't say it enough,
people keep telling me, you know, hey,

1881
01:52:50,661 --> 01:52:53,730
this podcast changed.
You're changed my life. I,

1882
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:56,780
I've heard it before and I appreciate
the fuck out of it every time.

1883
01:52:57,090 --> 01:52:59,810
And there's no other way to
say it, you know. Um, we're,

1884
01:52:59,811 --> 01:53:02,450
we're blown away by this whole thing.
We appreciate it.

1885
01:53:02,510 --> 01:53:07,380
Is this like love music in the background?
I've had the time of my life. Uh,

1886
01:53:08,430 --> 01:53:11,010
Sam is that dirty dancing?
Yes. Oh, was beautiful.

1887
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:15,740
But there was two hours put baby in a
corner. Okay. All right. So Joe rogan.net.

1888
01:53:15,770 --> 01:53:20,150
Go get it. It's available on paypal
and a, I think Amazon and um,

1889
01:53:20,690 --> 01:53:23,570
hopefully Amazon's already by today.
It was supposed to be. If it's not,

1890
01:53:23,571 --> 01:53:26,610
it should be around tomorrow,
but um, that's it. All right.

1891
01:53:27,290 --> 01:53:31,940
Go Fuck yourself or not. I don't
care honey. Honey, honey. Honey,

1892
01:53:31,941 --> 01:53:32,990
would you like play another song?
Honey?

1893
01:53:32,991 --> 01:53:35,600
Honey would be joining us this
Friday at the end of the world show.

1894
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:38,840
The first time we'd ever done a show with
band ever in the history of the world.

1895
01:53:38,890 --> 01:53:42,890
Yeah, no pressure. Nothing. We've
never yet, please be awesome.

1896
01:53:43,310 --> 01:53:46,100
You guys I believe are the first
people that played live in here, right?

1897
01:53:46,410 --> 01:53:49,690
Warranty. Yeah. Yeah. Everlast was
second. You guys were first. Yeah,

1898
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:54,510
we came for Everlast. Sherry's
left and right too. Yeah. Yeah.

1899
01:53:54,570 --> 01:53:57,270
We Love Pop and Cherries.
Hello?

1900
01:53:58,950 --> 01:54:02,240
I think you just contributed to
rape culture again. No, no, no.

1901
01:54:02,241 --> 01:54:06,210
They can be consensual and Cherry and uh,
she's my cherry pie.

1902
01:54:09,630 --> 01:54:11,670
Hey, thanks for having
us on here again, please.

1903
01:54:11,671 --> 01:54:14,770
We love you guys and the people that,
uh,

1904
01:54:15,210 --> 01:54:17,760
that's online love you guys.
The people that we, we,

1905
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:20,850
we've talked to so many people that say
thank you for turning us on the honey

1906
01:54:20,851 --> 01:54:25,080
honey, Twitter and they're awesome.
Isn't that cool? It's so great.

1907
01:54:25,290 --> 01:54:27,300
It's so good. I don't
know what happened, man,

1908
01:54:27,330 --> 01:54:30,210
but we have the coolest fucking people
in the world that are connected to us.

1909
01:54:30,211 --> 01:54:33,210
I really don't get it. I don't,
I don't know how it took place.

1910
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:38,240
It's an amazing lack of
douchebags staggering the
actual douche numbers to cool

1911
01:54:38,851 --> 01:54:42,090
people numbers. It's crazy. It doesn't
exist anywhere else on the earth.

1912
01:54:42,790 --> 01:54:47,470
We're creating utopia. It's pretty
cool and we appreciate it. Listen, we,

1913
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:50,100
we appreciate you guys.
You guys are awesome.

1914
01:54:50,130 --> 01:54:52,260
You're incredibly talented
and like I said before,

1915
01:54:52,261 --> 01:54:54,300
we do whatever the fuck we
can to promote you guys.

1916
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:58,290
Thank you. Well, speaking of, I want to
say that we have a show in Cleveland,

1917
01:54:58,291 --> 01:55:03,180
my hometown on a 1220 sixth that's the
day after Christmas at the House of Blues

1918
01:55:03,181 --> 01:55:08,130
in downtown and I feel like it's like
only half full right now off of Cleveland

1919
01:55:08,770 --> 01:55:12,420
in the, in the area were headlining.
So we're going to play for a nice,

1920
01:55:12,450 --> 01:55:16,320
nice chunk of time. When you guys do a
headline said, how long do you play for?

1921
01:55:16,610 --> 01:55:19,170
I think they're going to
do 70 minutes. Yeah, 70 75

1922
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:21,970
that's a good number.
I'd like to do that on standup too.

1923
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:25,140
When I do more than that, I feel
like I'm testing people's pain there.

1924
01:55:25,150 --> 01:55:29,590
Their attention. They're like enough,
dude. How much more you want to attention?

1925
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:32,960
Well, we talk a lot too. You know,
there's a lot of, this is just, you know,

1926
01:55:33,470 --> 01:55:36,440

Stanley type banter? Yeah.

1927
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:41,610

Oh. I was like, is that a committee?

1928
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:42,630
I thought it was that guy.
There was like,

1929
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:50,910

pull, pull some of that up.

1930
01:55:50,970 --> 01:55:54,500
Paul Stanley introducing for
kiss before we play this song.

1931
01:55:55,380 --> 01:55:56,430
Paul Shaffer.
No.

1932
01:55:56,431 --> 01:56:01,431
Paul Stanley from Kiss Paul
Stanley talks to the audience.

1933
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:06,210
It's great. No, you have to do it.

1934
01:56:06,211 --> 01:56:10,230
You have to be totally fucking cheesy.
Yeah. Paul tally talks to the audience.

1935
01:56:10,231 --> 01:56:13,770
This is a short video of Paul Stanley
talking and playing with the audience at a

1936
01:56:13,771 --> 01:56:18,650
kiss alive. 35 concert. That's a

1937
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:24,530
we should do, but that's
just, that's Peter. Chris,

1938
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:27,620
Paul Stanley does.
They've made cds out of it and the dude,

1939
01:56:27,621 --> 01:56:30,860
whoever you are that's made those cds.
I forget your name. Thank you very much.

1940
01:56:30,940 --> 01:56:33,290
Guy sent me a stack of them.
They're hilarious.

1941
01:56:33,291 --> 01:56:36,650
It's all Paul's down
from in between songs.

1942
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:40,313
Shit.

1943
01:56:42,770 --> 01:56:46,820
It's like super duty brute. He's getting
mad and shit with a laser. He's getting,

1944
01:56:47,260 --> 01:56:52,100
oh, some guys get a laser
laser come here. Schmuck.

1945
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:57,100
Come here, schmuck. No, you know? Yeah.
People know you're an old Jew when you're,

1946
01:56:57,101 --> 01:56:59,840
you're calling a guy schmuck
and you don't have a shirt on.

1947
01:57:02,380 --> 01:57:05,590
Try to find that one. He
talks to the audience. Yeah,

1948
01:57:05,620 --> 01:57:08,260
that's just so they could
get rid of some douchebag.

1949
01:57:09,270 --> 01:57:13,830
Is that it was amazing. Yeah. How
about that one? What was that one? Oh,

1950
01:57:13,831 --> 01:57:18,210
that's another one. It's
all making fun. Anyway,

1951
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:21,390
my point is I have no point.
That's my point.

1952
01:57:21,810 --> 01:57:25,200
My point is he's a hell of a show
him in that Paul Stanley got it.

1953
01:57:25,970 --> 01:57:28,780
Smart guys. Those kisses. They
made a lot of money though.

1954
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:36,980
You guys fans. What kind of music did
you listen to growing up? I listened to,

1955
01:57:37,450 --> 01:57:38,960
I have a really,
really old dad,

1956
01:57:38,961 --> 01:57:41,570
so I was listening to like
classical music and music.

1957
01:57:41,571 --> 01:57:45,760
Low Twenties and thirties and how old's
your dad? He's super old. He's 91 now.

1958
01:57:45,860 --> 01:57:50,210
Oh wait, how old are
you? I'm 27 Oh shit. You,

1959
01:57:50,211 --> 01:57:51,950
and this was before Cialis.

1960
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:53,913
Five hours

1961
01:57:54,030 --> 01:57:58,830
bars for how old was your jars?
28 years younger than him.

1962
01:57:59,790 --> 01:58:01,110
God bless your dad.

1963
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:06,690
Served in World War II in the Pacific
and in stormed the airfields of Pelu.

1964
01:58:06,990 --> 01:58:10,650
Oh Shit. Yeah, he's hard.

1965
01:58:10,651 --> 01:58:13,580
He's amazingly shit. Marc Jaffe, dude.

1966
01:58:13,581 --> 01:58:16,490
Do your dad is a hero.
It's,

1967
01:58:16,690 --> 01:58:20,640
that's why he got a boner is 28
years younger. Check. Yeah. A hero.

1968
01:58:21,730 --> 01:58:23,300
Hero boner.
You don't look Asian.

1969
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:27,330
How dare you?

1970
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:29,970
He's Russian.
He's a mail order bride.

1971
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:36,330
Easy, easy. Talking about
mom and dad here in the Fox.

1972
01:58:36,780 --> 01:58:40,080
So you listened to classic shit. It's
like, yeah, well I'll listen to like,

1973
01:58:40,290 --> 01:58:42,040
he would start,
you know there's an opera

1974
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:46,930
called the magic flute. Yup. That's gone
there. This is Mozart, Mozart opera,

1975
01:58:46,931 --> 01:58:48,970
couple of magic flute.
He played every single weekend.

1976
01:58:49,090 --> 01:58:52,390
So we'd just be blasting heat blasted,
like he was playing ACDC. But yeah.

1977
01:58:52,490 --> 01:58:56,290
Really? Wow. Every, every weekend. Yeah.

1978
01:58:56,690 --> 01:58:57,550
Can't remember that.

1979
01:58:58,120 --> 01:59:03,040
And then, um, what did he get you
into playing music? No, not really.

1980
01:59:03,070 --> 01:59:05,170
Neither of them did.
They didn't really play that much,

1981
01:59:05,740 --> 01:59:07,480
but I don't know where it started,

1982
01:59:07,481 --> 01:59:09,990
but I just decided I want
to play violin first.

1983
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,040
And I played violin when I
was like six and I dropped it.

1984
01:59:12,430 --> 01:59:15,610
And then I started playing drums and
from there on it just kind of freaked out

1985
01:59:15,611 --> 01:59:18,340
about it and go. So from
age six, you started with

1986
01:59:18,420 --> 01:59:22,680
violin? Yeah. Wow. I can't play it
at all anymore. No. It's a shame.

1987
01:59:22,681 --> 01:59:25,980
I feel like actually it would come back
if I really put it in the time to give

1988
01:59:25,981 --> 01:59:30,090
it a whirl. Yeah. I think no,

1989
01:59:30,330 --> 01:59:33,800
I'm not serious. I believe in you. I
think you can do it too. Mike am my chip

1990
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:40,590
came out of rocky. There
is no tomorrow. Um,

1991
01:59:41,010 --> 01:59:41,850
what about you Suzanne?

1992
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:43,460
How'd you start?
Um,

1993
01:59:43,730 --> 01:59:48,730
well I listened to a lot of like
juxtapose with my folks a ran an Italian

1994
01:59:50,181 --> 01:59:52,940
restaurant,
so I grew up with a lot of like jazz,

1995
01:59:52,941 --> 01:59:57,560
like Rosemary Clooney and Frank Sinatra
and we pre month, stuff like that. Um,

1996
01:59:57,650 --> 02:00:00,890
and I like that a lot.
And then like regular,

1997
02:00:00,891 --> 02:00:05,820
like nineties rock pop,
like Scorpions. My mom, no,

1998
02:00:05,821 --> 02:00:09,590
my mom was to rock set. There was a lot
of rock set in the car. What's rocks at?

1999
02:00:09,620 --> 02:00:14,270
Um, oh God. Um, w what's their
song? Hold on. It'll come to me.

2000
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:20,270
Fucking a red bands. Where
we at here there was, oh God,

2001
02:00:20,950 --> 02:00:25,640
we're upset. It'll come. Hold on.
But there's, there's rock set. Yeah.

2002
02:00:26,090 --> 02:00:29,400
Well how does it go? Uh, you're
trapped. The villa. Yeah.

2003
02:00:31,740 --> 02:00:36,180
Is there anything in fucking medicine
in it? None of it was that song. Yes.

2004
02:00:36,540 --> 02:00:40,530
So there's that. Like my, my mom was
the more sort of contemporary culture.

2005
02:00:40,531 --> 02:00:45,070
My Dad and I used to listen to a lot of
journey together and harmonize you guys

2006
02:00:45,071 --> 02:00:48,530
just to harmonize together.
I remember actually stop.

2007
02:00:50,580 --> 02:00:54,750
It was crazy and I'd be like, you
take the hi. And he'd be like, no,

2008
02:00:56,510 --> 02:01:01,500
dad would sing journey together. And My
dad played some, some acoustic guitar. Oh,

2009
02:01:01,580 --> 02:01:06,210
you know, he, he really like
Jethro Tull a lot. And Hailey.
Yeah, he was, you know, he,

2010
02:01:06,211 --> 02:01:10,010
he had a band in the 70s
and mustache and a perm.

2011
02:01:11,030 --> 02:01:15,410
Whoa. Your Dad's pretty, pretty hip.
That guy. Did he have bell bottoms?

2012
02:01:15,710 --> 02:01:18,150
I hope not, but yeah, of course.
No, I'm sure he did. Yeah.

2013
02:01:18,450 --> 02:01:20,290
There's all these pictures of my,
My,

2014
02:01:20,450 --> 02:01:22,380
my dad and my grandfather
and my uncles and they,

2015
02:01:22,420 --> 02:01:26,960
they look like Italian mobsters.
Like they just, everybody has like,

2016
02:01:27,110 --> 02:01:31,100
everything's like together. There's
like tailored suits and like glass,

2017
02:01:31,220 --> 02:01:35,570
big glasses and that's just the 70s now
retiring Elton John Glasses. Totally.

2018
02:01:35,571 --> 02:01:40,160
It was totally gay. Yeah. But um,
time the 70s or so, it's like they got

2019
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:44,210
disconnected from the mother
nipple of drugs. You know,

2020
02:01:44,230 --> 02:01:49,000
it's like in the 60s they all had an
acid and marijuana and mushrooms and then

2021
02:01:49,010 --> 02:01:52,140
the 70s like, oh, what are we
going to do? Stay sober man,

2022
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:57,110
lose pills, pills, confused.

2023
02:01:57,111 --> 02:02:01,370
Motherfuckers started wearing pointy
shoes and bell bottoms, big belt buckles.

2024
02:02:01,550 --> 02:02:06,170
What am I doing? I don't
what happened back then.

2025
02:02:06,171 --> 02:02:09,170
Dudes for the most part had such,

2026
02:02:09,410 --> 02:02:12,650
there was such a wardrobe wise speaking,

2027
02:02:12,950 --> 02:02:16,820
they were so much more of an effort put
into what guys would wear on a regular

2028
02:02:16,821 --> 02:02:21,470
basis because they didn't have match.com
couldn't just find people online.

2029
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:23,300
You get to pretend to be
something you weren't,

2030
02:02:23,301 --> 02:02:26,480
you had to go somewhere and wear the
outfit and do whatever you could get

2031
02:02:26,481 --> 02:02:30,140
someone to touch you. Jesus
Christ. What do I have to like,

2032
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:35,000
do I have to dance? You know, men
are essentially junkies and they're,

2033
02:02:35,001 --> 02:02:40,001
they're born into this world junkies and
then they go out as young men with full

2034
02:02:41,810 --> 02:02:46,610
raging hormones and it's this massive
quest to figure out how to get someone to

2035
02:02:46,611 --> 02:02:49,550
touch you. And what do I have to do? How,

2036
02:02:49,551 --> 02:02:52,340
what do I have to pretend I
have to talk a certain way,

2037
02:02:52,980 --> 02:02:56,900
cut my hair a certain way.
Let me just get that figured out first.

2038
02:02:56,901 --> 02:03:01,250
And every man is struggling with that
from the time where young, when we're 16,

2039
02:03:01,251 --> 02:03:04,610
17, 18 the conversations we have
is all about how we figure it out.

2040
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:08,930
How to fucking get them to like us.
Yeah.

2041
02:03:09,050 --> 02:03:12,320
Well that's what breeding is all about.
If it wasn't for that sense of urgency,

2042
02:03:12,321 --> 02:03:14,900
there'd be three people on the
planet, you know, you'd have to,

2043
02:03:15,260 --> 02:03:19,720
the only reason why we do it is because
we are junkies. We're just so crazy.

2044
02:03:19,740 --> 02:03:24,110
Just get rid of the loads. Just get him
in there. Quite so many touch. Right?

2045
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:30,200
And so there you go with bell bottoms,
fucking confusing wardrobe things.

2046
02:03:30,201 --> 02:03:33,170
It takes like 10 years for people to
go. What the fuck are we doing? Yeah.

2047
02:03:33,171 --> 02:03:36,320
What the fuck are we doing? These things
looks too, but it's fun. You're right man.

2048
02:03:36,470 --> 02:03:39,950
Fuck Bell Bottoms, pants are
still here. Okay. Pants work.

2049
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:43,600
Everybody's cool with genes. Genes have
been around since fucking, you know,

2050
02:03:43,700 --> 02:03:48,070
butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid at
the same jeans that you wear there wear

2051
02:03:48,071 --> 02:03:51,470
jeans. They were canvas,
which is interesting.

2052
02:03:51,740 --> 02:03:54,680
Most clothes and pants
during like the minor days,

2053
02:03:54,681 --> 02:03:58,250
the cowboy days were actually made with
cannabis. They were made out of hemp.

2054
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:03,620
Yeah. Most clothes. Yeah.
Well before the, um, the, the,

2055
02:04:03,710 --> 02:04:07,730
before slavery was illegal,
that's what most shit was made with the,

2056
02:04:07,731 --> 02:04:10,040
they made more close with,
uh,

2057
02:04:10,070 --> 02:04:13,310
with hemp and more flags and sales.

2058
02:04:13,311 --> 02:04:17,090
All that stuff is made with hemp because
it's much, much stronger than cotton.

2059
02:04:17,270 --> 02:04:21,320
And then when Eli Whitney came
along and made the cotton gin, oh,

2060
02:04:21,321 --> 02:04:23,630
then it became really easy
to make shit with cotton.

2061
02:04:23,870 --> 02:04:28,010
And then the decorticator
was invented in the 1930s.

2062
02:04:28,040 --> 02:04:32,660
In the 1930s was right after
prohibition for alcohol had ended.

2063
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:35,750
And they were trying to figure out
what to do with all these fucking drug

2064
02:04:35,751 --> 02:04:39,180
enforcement agents that were
assigned to go after alcohol.

2065
02:04:39,480 --> 02:04:44,480
And one of the things they did was a
concerted effort between this Guy William

2066
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:46,170
Randolph Hearst that
owned all the newspapers.

2067
02:04:46,350 --> 02:04:50,130
We also owned all these paper mills and
the cover of Popular Science magazine

2068
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:53,040
had this article hemp,
the new billion dollar crop.

2069
02:04:53,430 --> 02:04:56,520
And so everybody was switching over
to hemp cause they had created this

2070
02:04:56,521 --> 02:05:00,870
decorticator which allows you to
effectively processed to hemp fiber,

2071
02:05:00,900 --> 02:05:02,610
the stalk of the plant,

2072
02:05:02,611 --> 02:05:05,900
which is like credibly useful
for making paper and close it.

2073
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:07,920
It allowed you to process
it without slavery,

2074
02:05:08,430 --> 02:05:11,280
allows you to process it like
an economically effectively.

2075
02:05:11,670 --> 02:05:15,030
And so William Randolph Hearst started
printing all these articles about

2076
02:05:15,031 --> 02:05:20,031
marijuana and about how marijuana was
causing blacks and Mexicans to rape white

2077
02:05:20,311 --> 02:05:24,960
women. So that's how they
shut down the hemp business.

2078
02:05:25,080 --> 02:05:27,420
It was all about hemp as a commodity.

2079
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:30,730
It wasn't about cotton interests his own.

2080
02:05:30,970 --> 02:05:35,090
He was protecting paper because he
owned paper mills. He was a, um, uh,

2081
02:05:35,100 --> 02:05:38,970
also dupont had an interest in it
because dupont came up with the chemical

2082
02:05:38,971 --> 02:05:41,340
composition for nylon to make ropes.

2083
02:05:41,580 --> 02:05:46,180
And previously all ropes had been
made at a hemp. So there was, uh,

2084
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:50,700
it's, it's, it's, it's readily
available. You can get it online.

2085
02:05:52,190 --> 02:05:56,010
It's amazing. That is very impressive.
It's just memory. That's all it is.

2086
02:05:56,011 --> 02:05:58,860
It's just, look, you asked me
shit about important things,

2087
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:01,860
like where are your taxes go?
I don't really know that.

2088
02:06:03,510 --> 02:06:08,460
We don't want to know. You should know
or be our overlords are lying to us,

2089
02:06:08,670 --> 02:06:11,520
but that's the only reason why it's still
legal today or it's still legal today

2090
02:06:11,521 --> 02:06:14,890
is now it's gone from a
textile and uh, you know, in a,

2091
02:06:14,891 --> 02:06:16,620
in an issue with like nylon,

2092
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:20,400
now it's gone to pharmaceutical drugs and
the influence of pharmaceutical drugs.

2093
02:06:20,460 --> 02:06:21,240
The only reason why it's,

2094
02:06:21,240 --> 02:06:24,900
and then there's also people that
would profit from it being illegal.

2095
02:06:24,901 --> 02:06:28,950
Like prison guard unions actively
spend money to try to keep marijuana,

2096
02:06:28,951 --> 02:06:31,920
illegal private prisons.

2097
02:06:31,950 --> 02:06:34,810
They will actively try to
spend money to keep marijuana.

2098
02:06:34,811 --> 02:06:37,230
And we didn't go because they want to
keep the prison stock cause that's what

2099
02:06:37,231 --> 02:06:41,250
they make money. Not Amazing.
Yeah. Private prison unions,

2100
02:06:41,251 --> 02:06:46,080
prison guard unions spend money to make
sure that drug stay illegal. That's cute.

2101
02:06:46,290 --> 02:06:49,230
Isn't that cute?
Because they make money.

2102
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:54,360
I mean it literally is like slavery.
I mean if it wasn't illegal,

2103
02:06:54,361 --> 02:06:57,390
those people wouldn't be in jail.
They'd be free.

2104
02:06:57,510 --> 02:07:01,860
So you make something that they do and
you spend money to keep it illegal.

2105
02:07:01,861 --> 02:07:03,540
Something enjoy it.
It doesn't hurt anybody else.

2106
02:07:03,690 --> 02:07:08,520
You spend money to keep it illegal so
you can enslave them and make money from

2107
02:07:08,521 --> 02:07:13,020
the fact that they're locked in a
cage that you own mass incarceration.

2108
02:07:13,740 --> 02:07:17,160
That's amazing. Gary. We're going
to look back on this day in,

2109
02:07:17,161 --> 02:07:19,290
in the future when people are,

2110
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:23,580
when they have full access to
everything including thoughts and all,

2111
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:26,910
all misinformation will be
accounted for and corrected.

2112
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:31,620
We will look back with great shame
and how stupid we ran this world.

2113
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:36,100
We will look back at it with
great shame at the people that we

2114
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:40,840
called our leaders and what a
group of fucking monkeys they are.

2115
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:45,040
When you see them arguing about the
fiscal cliff and all this other nonsense,

2116
02:07:45,041 --> 02:07:49,810
you realized these are incredibly flawed
human beings from a different time and

2117
02:07:49,811 --> 02:07:54,811
an error and they're all trying to appease
these fucking monsters that put them

2118
02:07:54,911 --> 02:07:58,060
into position. These,
these, these corporations,

2119
02:07:58,061 --> 02:08:02,920
they spend millions of dollars in
associate pathic way to try to profit from

2120
02:08:02,921 --> 02:08:04,420
these fucks representing them.

2121
02:08:04,690 --> 02:08:07,600
We're going to look back on this
and we're going to be really,

2122
02:08:07,601 --> 02:08:09,430
really shocked that we were this week.

2123
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:14,880
We're going to be really shocked that
it was this pathetic with our incredible

2124
02:08:14,951 --> 02:08:19,660
access to information that we were
still this wonky with our system of

2125
02:08:19,661 --> 02:08:23,260
government and our system,
money and welfare and and, and,

2126
02:08:23,580 --> 02:08:27,100
and protecting each other and our sense
of community in our willingness to go

2127
02:08:27,101 --> 02:08:29,740
into wars. We're going to look back
on it. It's going to be shocking.

2128
02:08:30,070 --> 02:08:31,660
Just as shocking as the inquisition.

2129
02:08:31,740 --> 02:08:36,210
Don't know what they're doing.
You know? I think that it's,

2130
02:08:36,450 --> 02:08:39,060
it is,
it is a joke to see how,

2131
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:43,200
how the world is run or a country or
whatever. Sometimes. Not all the time,

2132
02:08:43,201 --> 02:08:47,970
but you know, I don't think that it,
it's, it goes like under their radar.

2133
02:08:47,971 --> 02:08:51,930
I think it's just like
politics and selfishness.

2134
02:08:52,180 --> 02:08:55,120
It's damp and it's also completely
out of control. It's so big.

2135
02:08:55,590 --> 02:08:57,520
Like the system is so interconnected.

2136
02:08:57,521 --> 02:09:00,520
There's hundreds of
different organizations.

2137
02:09:00,530 --> 02:09:03,280
There's more than a hundred
different countries.

2138
02:09:03,281 --> 02:09:05,380
There's all this fucking politics.

2139
02:09:05,381 --> 02:09:09,040
There's a certain amount
of natural resources that
they need every fucking day.

2140
02:09:09,310 --> 02:09:10,990
There's so much is going on.

2141
02:09:11,110 --> 02:09:16,110
There's so many different connected
issues and does so many fucking human

2142
02:09:17,711 --> 02:09:21,250
beings. It's so hard. It's like
people were born into this system.

2143
02:09:21,940 --> 02:09:26,260
It's completely chaotic. It's completely
out of control, completely corrupt.

2144
02:09:26,590 --> 02:09:30,040
And it's like everybody agrees. Everybody
looks at it and says it's a mass,

2145
02:09:30,041 --> 02:09:33,280
but no one knows what to do. And they
try to work within the system to fix it,

2146
02:09:33,281 --> 02:09:34,600
but that doesn't seem to be working.

2147
02:09:34,990 --> 02:09:38,890
So it's like our options are wait for
it to completely fall apart and come up

2148
02:09:38,891 --> 02:09:43,891
with something totally new or slowly sort
of chip away at this horrible problem

2149
02:09:44,051 --> 02:09:48,130
that our ancestors have created and left
us with because that's the real issue.

2150
02:09:48,160 --> 02:09:52,090
It's like you and I and we, we
never, we didn't create this world.

2151
02:09:52,091 --> 02:09:57,091
We didn't decide to invade Afghanistan
and we say we are going to war with Iraq.

2152
02:09:57,820 --> 02:09:59,710
We have nothing to do with that.

2153
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:04,420
The fact that some human
beings that somehow or another
represent us cause we're

2154
02:10:04,421 --> 02:10:06,070
all in this one patch of dirt together,

2155
02:10:06,071 --> 02:10:09,790
his car Raese and it's always been crazy.

2156
02:10:09,791 --> 02:10:12,700
It was crazy when the Romans did it.
It's crazy when the Greeks did it,

2157
02:10:12,910 --> 02:10:14,680
but it's even more crazy when we do it.

2158
02:10:14,890 --> 02:10:17,050
It's more crazy when we
do it because we have,

2159
02:10:17,110 --> 02:10:21,040
we have the access to the information
that allows us to see the wiring under the

2160
02:10:21,041 --> 02:10:24,610
board and see what's really motivating
this whole thing and see where this is

2161
02:10:24,611 --> 02:10:27,340
all going from. And it's
embarrassing. It's embarrassing.

2162
02:10:27,550 --> 02:10:30,610
It's embarrassing with there
were so dumb that this is,

2163
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:33,860
these are our leaders at guys like Newt
Gingrich really think there could be

2164
02:10:33,861 --> 02:10:38,510
president. It's embarrassing.
It's embarrassing. Oh,

2165
02:10:38,511 --> 02:10:43,010
of it that a guy like Mitt Romney can
have this incredibly horrific record in

2166
02:10:43,011 --> 02:10:48,011
business and still put himself up as a
businessman for the people and almost get

2167
02:10:48,921 --> 02:10:51,400
elected,
but just as crazy,

2168
02:10:51,401 --> 02:10:55,820
the guy like Obama can win the Nobel
Peace Prize then send 30,000 more people

2169
02:10:55,821 --> 02:11:00,170
with guns to Afghanistan.
Fucking crazy. We're crazy shit.

2170
02:11:01,860 --> 02:11:06,430
Yeah. Circumstances.
Circumstances are right.

2171
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:11,070
It's, it's such a, it's just
like an endless, it's like
that not, what's that thing?

2172
02:11:11,071 --> 02:11:14,060
That Gordian knot or whatever
we just talking about it.

2173
02:11:14,290 --> 02:11:16,350
There's that story about Alexander
the Great and he has this,

2174
02:11:16,351 --> 02:11:19,080
not that no one can untie.

2175
02:11:19,170 --> 02:11:22,600
It's just this endlessly complex knot
and you can't cut it actually that,

2176
02:11:22,620 --> 02:11:26,490
that's what he did. He just sliced it
in half and destroyed this Gordian knot.

2177
02:11:26,580 --> 02:11:28,110
I've never heard of that Gordian knot.

2178
02:11:28,170 --> 02:11:33,090
Yeah. Um, and you have these
people, I don't know. It's, wow.

2179
02:11:33,091 --> 02:11:35,190
It's the first time I've ever heard that.
Um,

2180
02:11:36,570 --> 02:11:41,570
you're dealing with this
infinitely complex situation
and you still have humans

2181
02:11:42,481 --> 02:11:45,680
that are trying to solve
it. Yeah. So I dunno.

2182
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:47,880
I think sometimes

2183
02:11:49,740 --> 02:11:53,960
there's sometimes there's a lot
of energy put towards, you know,

2184
02:11:54,930 --> 02:11:57,780
defaming the people in
power and sing and I'm not,

2185
02:11:57,781 --> 02:12:01,050
I'm not a supporter of a lot of the
people that you're talking about are the

2186
02:12:01,051 --> 02:12:04,830
systems that govern, but I think it
was interesting like this last week,

2187
02:12:04,850 --> 02:12:06,150
sorry to get back on this,

2188
02:12:06,151 --> 02:12:11,100
but the shooting thing and there's this
knee jerk reaction that comes from a

2189
02:12:11,101 --> 02:12:16,101
place of anger with a lot of people and
I think that ends up just being wasted

2190
02:12:16,411 --> 02:12:21,060
energy. And when people just
start spouting off about
how you know, things are,

2191
02:12:21,090 --> 02:12:24,780
are, aren't the way they
should be and reacting angrily,

2192
02:12:24,781 --> 02:12:28,260
it takes away energy from
changing individual lifestyles,

2193
02:12:28,261 --> 02:12:30,220
which is the only thing we
can really do. Right? Like,

2194
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:33,660
that's the only thing that you can
change is how you're living your life and

2195
02:12:33,720 --> 02:12:37,710
your usage of these resources that are
basically the reason why we're in all

2196
02:12:37,711 --> 02:12:41,160
these difficult situations because
of the way we live. Our lives,

2197
02:12:41,220 --> 02:12:44,670
takes up x amount of resource
from, you know, Afghan Joe.

2198
02:12:44,671 --> 02:12:49,010
So we have to go in there and take
his stuff and create, you know,

2199
02:12:49,020 --> 02:12:52,530
complicated situations we can't get
out of. Right. You know, I dunno, I'm,

2200
02:12:52,570 --> 02:12:53,460
I'm just rambling here.

2201
02:12:53,800 --> 02:12:58,570
No, no, no. I agree with you in,

2202
02:12:58,571 --> 02:13:02,680
in a lot of ways and I think that,
um, I would hate to have to be,

2203
02:13:02,681 --> 02:13:05,500
I think if you were elected
president right now, you'd be fucked.

2204
02:13:05,590 --> 02:13:08,140
I think anybody would be people,
even with good intentions,

2205
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:11,140
I think there's so many things you have
to deal with. There's so many pressures,

2206
02:13:11,141 --> 02:13:15,730
so, so much going on and you know, as much
as you want to be the voice of reason,

2207
02:13:15,731 --> 02:13:19,780
you live in a fucking crazy world.
The Pakistan still exists. Okay.

2208
02:13:20,020 --> 02:13:23,920
So fucking completely disconnected
country with nuclear arms and a hate for

2209
02:13:23,921 --> 02:13:26,500
India, their next door neighbor
and they're there. I mean,

2210
02:13:26,501 --> 02:13:29,800
we had Shane Smith from vice.com and
he's talking about how, you know,

2211
02:13:29,801 --> 02:13:32,280
leaders from that part of the
world have said they want to strap

2212
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:35,040
themselves with nuclear bombs and
clover and destroy their enemies,

2213
02:13:35,400 --> 02:13:36,840
but they're fucking crazy.

2214
02:13:37,170 --> 02:13:40,440
And this is 2012 and this is a reality
that people have to deal with. You know,

2215
02:13:40,650 --> 02:13:44,370
that's why you need navy seals. You need
the army, you need the marines, you need,

2216
02:13:44,371 --> 02:13:47,610
I mean, it sounds, people want it. They
don't want to think that that's real.

2217
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:51,030
They don't want to think that you,
you do need a military.

2218
02:13:51,031 --> 02:13:54,180
You fucking need a military man
unless you want your, your, your,

2219
02:13:54,270 --> 02:13:56,880
your wife raped in the
street by Chinese soldiers.

2220
02:13:57,060 --> 02:13:58,830
And I'm not saying the
Chinese want to do that,

2221
02:13:58,950 --> 02:14:02,460
but I'm saying that that traditionally
has been what human beings have done.

2222
02:14:02,461 --> 02:14:05,820
That's what Gangas Kahn did. That's
what the Romans did, is the Greeks did.

2223
02:14:06,420 --> 02:14:08,880
People have been taking over
people from the history, from the,

2224
02:14:08,900 --> 02:14:11,310
for the first time people
started writing things down.

2225
02:14:11,400 --> 02:14:15,270
It's a fucking series of stories
about people taking over other people.

2226
02:14:15,420 --> 02:14:19,440
That's what everybody's always done
and if you don't protect the people,

2227
02:14:19,530 --> 02:14:22,650
then that's most likely going to happen
because we really haven't evolved enough

2228
02:14:22,651 --> 02:14:24,670
to not to not have it happen.
You know,

2229
02:14:24,671 --> 02:14:27,540
it would be beautiful if everybody
was all peace, love and Kumbaya,

2230
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:30,840
but the reality is if you actually
pay attention to the news,

2231
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:35,160
there's a lot of non Kumbaya type shit
going down all over the world. You know,

2232
02:14:35,161 --> 02:14:36,960
you,
you need a little bit of a military.

2233
02:14:37,230 --> 02:14:40,020
The problem is you've got a military
and then you have a bunch of people that

2234
02:14:40,021 --> 02:14:40,830
decide,
you know,

2235
02:14:40,830 --> 02:14:44,190
fucking son his bitches over here and
then we've got some oil and make a lot of

2236
02:14:44,191 --> 02:14:45,024
money.

2237
02:14:45,950 --> 02:14:50,950
Then you go 2012 I have no point to this
and the this bitch and doesn't do any

2238
02:14:51,241 --> 02:14:52,920
good. And the only, the only,

2239
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:54,900
the only thing you could
possibly have was it somebody,

2240
02:14:54,901 --> 02:14:58,170
maybe you could listen to me and run
for president and make some sense.

2241
02:14:58,230 --> 02:15:01,650
That's it. The young, the young people,
the only people that you can change.

2242
02:15:01,980 --> 02:15:04,410
You're not going to change Newt Gingrich,
that all Kofi fuck,

2243
02:15:04,411 --> 02:15:07,340
he's not going to take mushrooms. Well,
you gotta do to Newt Gingrich. Hey,

2244
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:10,000
going to change new kangaroos.
Yes, yes, yes. I slept with him.

2245
02:15:10,001 --> 02:15:11,370
It freak out and have a heart attack,

2246
02:15:12,510 --> 02:15:15,330
cut his dick off and drown himself
in a bathtub. You go crazy.

2247
02:15:19,270 --> 02:15:24,270
No way to ah, no, that's no way to go.
This isn't mean, there's no point to this.

2248
02:15:24,271 --> 02:15:25,104
I mean,
we've,

2249
02:15:25,140 --> 02:15:27,990
we've had this conversation with a hundred
different people a hundred different

2250
02:15:27,991 --> 02:15:29,130
times and there's no,

2251
02:15:29,660 --> 02:15:31,180
I don't think that,
um,

2252
02:15:32,750 --> 02:15:35,810
I really get so uncomfortable talking
about these things because I don't feel

2253
02:15:35,811 --> 02:15:39,870
like I'm, I've informed myself
enough to have a strong opinion. Um,

2254
02:15:40,040 --> 02:15:41,540
but my instincts and just,

2255
02:15:41,900 --> 02:15:45,290
I agree with you that it doesn't matter
who's president. It's like you're,

2256
02:15:45,350 --> 02:15:49,620
you're fucked because you've inherited
is a mountain of Shit, you know?

2257
02:15:50,030 --> 02:15:50,863
Um,

2258
02:15:51,320 --> 02:15:55,610
for centuries I think that unfortunately,
and I'm,

2259
02:15:55,640 --> 02:15:59,510
I got forbid, but you know, I
don't, I don't think that, um,

2260
02:16:00,620 --> 02:16:01,400
you know,

2261
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:04,670
I think it's going to be something
huge that's going to change everything.

2262
02:16:04,671 --> 02:16:07,700
And I don't know what that is. I don't
know if that's something catastrophic.

2263
02:16:07,701 --> 02:16:10,920
I don't know if that's the aliens
coming or whatever the fuck I,

2264
02:16:10,940 --> 02:16:14,690
but something else would have to
happen for anything to really change.

2265
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:18,800
I think it's happening right in front
of our face. I think it's the Internet.

2266
02:16:19,760 --> 02:16:20,320
Oh yeah.

2267
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:24,130
If there's an alien. I think the aliens,
the Internet, the, the, the, this,

2268
02:16:24,160 --> 02:16:29,160
this alien entity that is created
by humans that allows to connect

2269
02:16:30,430 --> 02:16:35,430
and exponentially grow together in some
strange way that would never be possible

2270
02:16:35,561 --> 02:16:40,390
without it to have access to information
that will never be available and no one

2271
02:16:40,391 --> 02:16:43,330
saw coming.
No one saw it coming and it's a factor.

2272
02:16:43,331 --> 02:16:47,980
It's an alien factor created by human
beings. It's alien to the earth.

2273
02:16:48,190 --> 02:16:51,640
It's alien to any of the systems that
have been set up before as far as natural

2274
02:16:51,641 --> 02:16:56,170
systems of natural selection, of,
of, of survival, of the fittest.

2275
02:16:56,171 --> 02:16:58,810
Any of those select.
This is an alien system.

2276
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:03,610
This is an access to information
in language. If the, if
something happens with,

2277
02:17:03,640 --> 02:17:05,710
what'd you say bro?
If the,

2278
02:17:06,150 --> 02:17:08,850
like none of us have the
know how most people,

2279
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:12,300
like if if the Wifi gets knocked out,
you know what I mean?

2280
02:17:12,660 --> 02:17:13,880
Like you lose all access to

2281
02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:16,420
no, that's true. I mean we look,
but you know what? If you're,

2282
02:17:16,450 --> 02:17:20,440
you're a juggler had slit, your blood
falls out and you're done. You know

2283
02:17:21,470 --> 02:17:25,010
God, I hope the Internet. That's why I'm
saying I need to think it's cultural.

2284
02:17:25,670 --> 02:17:30,050
It's culturally my bows and
arrows analogous to our blood.

2285
02:17:30,730 --> 02:17:32,630
Which ones are the good
berries in the bad berries?

2286
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:36,580
You know that ultimate fighter star
with the that that broke his penis? Yes.

2287
02:17:36,620 --> 02:17:39,560
Oh God, yes. Totally

2288
02:17:41,450 --> 02:17:42,710
magical ray lb.

2289
02:17:42,770 --> 02:17:46,340
Apparently he had a girl hopping
up and down on his Johnson and she

2290
02:17:46,341 --> 02:17:51,341
miscalculated her exit and reentry and
it was tank to tip snapped his Penai

2291
02:17:56,080 --> 02:18:00,200
in the hospital for several days getting
his shaft repaired and who knows if

2292
02:18:00,201 --> 02:18:01,360
I've ever totally recover.

2293
02:18:04,020 --> 02:18:05,130
That's how,
that's how I won.

2294
02:18:05,131 --> 02:18:10,131
Ultimate fighter fucks that
tendon dick tissue optic tissue.

2295
02:18:13,560 --> 02:18:17,670
Yeah, it's officially
dictation. I've never broken it,

2296
02:18:17,671 --> 02:18:21,080
but I heard it a couple of times.
Got It.

2297
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:22,913
You can't be,

2298
02:18:23,430 --> 02:18:27,430
you can't let a strange girl doesn't
know how long you penises ride you. Okay?

2299
02:18:27,431 --> 02:18:28,140
You got to,

2300
02:18:28,140 --> 02:18:33,140
you should hold firmly onto her waist
and control her exit and reentry.

2301
02:18:33,660 --> 02:18:35,460
You gotta be careful.
You gotta be careful.

2302
02:18:35,700 --> 02:18:38,640
You got to have a good grip on the waist
and you got to do a lot of kettlebells

2303
02:18:38,740 --> 02:18:42,210
tow. You want to be able to pick
her up in case she gets crazy.

2304
02:18:42,211 --> 02:18:42,920
You want to be able to

2305
02:18:42,920 --> 02:18:46,460
troll that thrust. It's very
important, you know? I mean,

2306
02:18:46,480 --> 02:18:48,890
a lot of girls would like to be on top.
There's nothing wrong with that.

2307
02:18:48,891 --> 02:18:52,880
Folks don't get wrong, but you
men to protect your penis. Okay?

2308
02:18:52,910 --> 02:18:56,540
And the way to protect your penis has
a firm grip on the hips as gotta be a

2309
02:18:56,541 --> 02:18:59,870
certain point where you're in danger.
When they passed this,

2310
02:18:59,960 --> 02:19:00,950
you know how long you,
Dick is.

2311
02:19:01,150 --> 02:19:04,990
Okay? Don't get like bouncing up and down.

2312
02:19:04,991 --> 02:19:06,310
That's the only way to break a dick.

2313
02:19:06,370 --> 02:19:10,960
If he missed fired that fucking that
is you would know you were doing,

2314
02:19:10,961 --> 02:19:13,380
then you would stop while you're doing
it. You wouldn't do it. It's still in.

2315
02:19:13,400 --> 02:19:15,460
The only way to break a
dick is a girl to be on top.

2316
02:19:15,670 --> 02:19:18,220
I think that's 100% of all the
broken decks I've come from.

2317
02:19:18,221 --> 02:19:21,720
A girl being outside is a few off the
bed falls and stuff like that. Yeah.

2318
02:19:21,730 --> 02:19:25,720
Those guys are those natural selection.
They're supposed to fall,

2319
02:19:26,590 --> 02:19:28,850
landed on his dick.
It's happened and then you broke it.

2320
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:32,550
That deck that's happened.
Dude's tripped and landed on his dick

2321
02:19:34,480 --> 02:19:38,990
and Jujitsu once.
I used to not wear a cup and my God,

2322
02:19:39,500 --> 02:19:42,200
that story again. You
love the store. I go,

2323
02:19:42,201 --> 02:19:45,950
I got kneed in the Dick like on the
deck, like flat and my deck out. Bam.

2324
02:19:45,951 --> 02:19:50,630
Really hard by my friend
Einstein, incidentally. Funny
nickname. It's great guy.

2325
02:19:51,050 --> 02:19:53,960
Anyway, it was, it wasn't his fault,
it was just trying to pass my guard.

2326
02:19:53,961 --> 02:19:57,440
He and he slammed his need and my dick
and I didn't know I was hurt. I mean,

2327
02:19:57,441 --> 02:20:02,150
I knew it hurt, but I thought it was okay.
And, uh, you know, it's just like, ah,

2328
02:20:02,151 --> 02:20:03,010
and then you know,
you,

2329
02:20:03,020 --> 02:20:06,420
you sit down for a minute or so
and then he'd go back in when,

2330
02:20:06,430 --> 02:20:08,210
when not in so much pain.

2331
02:20:08,450 --> 02:20:12,180
But then when I went to the
locker room after training, uh,

2332
02:20:12,360 --> 02:20:14,620
I had blue shorts on and I,
or blue pants on.

2333
02:20:14,621 --> 02:20:18,470
I didn't know I took my pants off
of my jock strip was red with blood.

2334
02:20:18,740 --> 02:20:19,610
Oh my gosh.

2335
02:20:19,611 --> 02:20:23,870
So my deck had been bleeding into my jock
strap and then I peed and it came out

2336
02:20:23,871 --> 02:20:26,600
of my Dick. It was bloody. So
then I have to figure out, okay,

2337
02:20:26,990 --> 02:20:30,320
do I overreact here or do I treat
it like I would treat my nose?

2338
02:20:30,560 --> 02:20:34,640
Because if my nose,
my nose is important to me,

2339
02:20:34,850 --> 02:20:36,680
my nose is bloody,
I would go to a doctor.

2340
02:20:36,920 --> 02:20:39,710
So this is one of the things you have
to do when you do Jujitsu on a regular

2341
02:20:39,711 --> 02:20:41,350
basis, you're always
getting hurt. It's all,

2342
02:20:41,351 --> 02:20:44,980
you've got to know what the difference
between a torn ACL is and you know, a,

2343
02:20:45,010 --> 02:20:48,800
a cramp muscle, you know,
so I had to figure out,

2344
02:20:48,801 --> 02:20:53,430
so what I did was I decided I was going to
masturbate. So went home. No, you, yeah,

2345
02:20:54,390 --> 02:20:58,310
no, no. I went home and I was
like, if I have a hard on,

2346
02:20:58,880 --> 02:21:00,980
I'm sure my dick still
works and so I'm good.

2347
02:21:01,130 --> 02:21:04,760
So I got a hard on and a Jack
[inaudible] and it looked like an embryo.

2348
02:21:05,090 --> 02:21:07,440
It looked like, like the
inside of an egg. No,

2349
02:21:10,290 --> 02:21:15,140
no, I don't have much as a
line. This is not online anyway,

2350
02:21:15,670 --> 02:21:16,503
but,

2351
02:21:17,490 --> 02:21:21,830
and it came out that way when a PD came
out of the way for three or four days

2352
02:21:22,040 --> 02:21:25,010
and it slowly, like less
and less. So I was like,

2353
02:21:25,011 --> 02:21:28,040
I kept touching it and make sure
it's not effectives no pain.

2354
02:21:28,041 --> 02:21:31,400
I checked my temperature, no fever, and
everything's cool. There's no infection,

2355
02:21:31,401 --> 02:21:36,210
so it's all right. Just took
a few days off. That was it.

2356
02:21:36,211 --> 02:21:39,320
It healed up pretty sure it's okay.
And I made a baby since then,

2357
02:21:39,321 --> 02:21:40,154
so it's all good.

2358
02:21:42,750 --> 02:21:46,100
I think I made both of
my babies since then,

2359
02:21:46,101 --> 02:21:50,690
so it's 100% fires,
but it was a little scary,

2360
02:21:50,810 --> 02:21:53,690
but it didn't look scary.
It looked normal on the outside.

2361
02:21:53,691 --> 02:21:57,370
That's why I was so confident. It
wasn't like funny, swollen, felt better,

2362
02:21:58,520 --> 02:22:01,580
didn't hurt. That was a crazy thing.
It just blood was coming out of it.

2363
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:05,390
That is bizarre.
Bizarre when you get need that big,

2364
02:22:06,200 --> 02:22:07,980
oh that is from my dick

2365
02:22:11,090 --> 02:22:15,770
didn't put it online. That's just blood.
But it was really weird. But it was,

2366
02:22:15,780 --> 02:22:18,500
it was also, I was like really
questioning my own judgment. I was like,

2367
02:22:18,501 --> 02:22:21,230
what did I just really just
jerk off after I broke my Dick?

2368
02:22:21,500 --> 02:22:22,880
A fuck is wrong with me.

2369
02:22:23,410 --> 02:22:26,790
And I was like sitting there looking
at the sink looking at this, you know?

2370
02:22:28,260 --> 02:22:29,970
And I did it like in
a medical sort of way.

2371
02:22:30,210 --> 02:22:33,110
I didn't like sit in front of like
a computer. Like Ah, Yay, fuck.

2372
02:22:33,111 --> 02:22:36,690
He really had a stern look on your,
I was like all medical shit.

2373
02:22:36,930 --> 02:22:39,510
I'm sure I probably thought about like
some ex girlfriend or something to get

2374
02:22:39,511 --> 02:22:41,130
the job done.
But it was,

2375
02:22:41,630 --> 02:22:44,870
you know, a clinical approach and
everything. I wanted to make sure

2376
02:22:45,410 --> 02:22:46,350
that my dick worked.

2377
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:49,410
Did that disturb you and Nina Hartley
was talking about wearing gloves when she

2378
02:22:49,411 --> 02:22:49,690
was on [inaudible].

2379
02:22:49,690 --> 02:22:54,370
Kevin rather have a person where
it glove and put his finger in her.

2380
02:22:54,410 --> 02:22:56,180
We have Nina Hartley on.
Do you know who she is?

2381
02:22:56,181 --> 02:23:00,710
Still old school porn star from like the
eighties and she's still doing orgies

2382
02:23:00,711 --> 02:23:01,280
and banging

2383
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:04,110
people all over the world.
I do know who that is.

2384
02:23:09,660 --> 02:23:11,700
She likes to,
when people work gloves,

2385
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:16,270
she wears gloves and she wants
them to wear gloves. Like mittens.

2386
02:23:16,640 --> 02:23:21,060
Yeah, like big Christmas Santa Claus
type gloves. She wants them to be clean.

2387
02:23:21,270 --> 02:23:22,380
She wants everybody to be clean.

2388
02:23:22,540 --> 02:23:27,160
I don't blame her. I mean,
I mean come on, you don't

2389
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:31,000
think you're going in there.
Action photography thing.

2390
02:23:33,090 --> 02:23:36,960
How dare you show my ass.
How can we can show my ass on Ustream?

2391
02:23:36,970 --> 02:23:39,550
But you can't show that the hookers
tip because that's not your real,

2392
02:23:39,551 --> 02:23:42,840
but you told me
it's not my real bud.

2393
02:23:45,540 --> 02:23:47,620
You know what? You guys were
gonna play another song about it.

2394
02:23:50,320 --> 02:23:54,280
I kind of like where this is.
Go play one.

2395
02:23:54,720 --> 02:23:59,480
It's called Dick Tissue Tissue.

2396
02:23:59,810 --> 02:24:03,740
You guys have a song called
Dick Shit. Tissue reset. No,

2397
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:09,820
no, no. I just don't know if I want
to play this song. What song is this?

2398
02:24:09,940 --> 02:24:14,210
It's a new song. It's a
tender one. Can we talk about,

2399
02:24:14,240 --> 02:24:19,070
can we like bring it down?
Bring it down. I kept,

2400
02:24:19,080 --> 02:24:19,913
my kids are awesome.

2401
02:24:20,370 --> 02:24:24,690
They're awesome. Yeah, I
love them. They're fun.

2402
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:30,180
Great little girls, little tiny
girls that I hang out with every day.

2403
02:24:30,450 --> 02:24:34,230
A big part of my day is hanging
out. I'm like, you like, yes.

2404
02:24:34,231 --> 02:24:38,670
Do your children like no question.
But uh, it's not just my children.

2405
02:24:38,671 --> 02:24:43,671
It's also a little four year
old individual who happens
to be a girl and she's

2406
02:24:44,221 --> 02:24:47,430
experiencing all these girl things
and I want to be like, what the fuck?

2407
02:24:47,431 --> 02:24:49,350
We're not going to go see that.
I don't want to get to see that shit,

2408
02:24:49,500 --> 02:24:51,780
but for whatever it is
that she wants to go to,

2409
02:24:51,781 --> 02:24:54,870
like we have to go see the Grinch
like you have to like do it,

2410
02:24:54,871 --> 02:24:57,480
will like get excited with her.
Like do you want to go to the carousel?

2411
02:24:57,810 --> 02:25:01,770
Oh yes. I'll be so good.
I want to ride a unicorn.

2412
02:25:01,850 --> 02:25:05,100
Do you think the Unicorn will be
available? Like I bet it will available.

2413
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:09,570
Oh yeah. She's wicked smart. She's
crazy smart, but it's like you,

2414
02:25:09,571 --> 02:25:12,970
you get to see things through
the eyes of a four year old girl.

2415
02:25:13,300 --> 02:25:16,990
It's really interesting. It's
fascinating. It's incredibly fascinating.

2416
02:25:16,991 --> 02:25:19,030
I mean obviously I love her to death.

2417
02:25:19,031 --> 02:25:23,050
She's amazing and I'm so
happy just to having children.

2418
02:25:23,080 --> 02:25:24,040
It's like a really incredible

2419
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:24,610
experience.

2420
02:25:24,610 --> 02:25:27,280
It's really hard to wrap your head
around it and I don't recommend it to

2421
02:25:27,281 --> 02:25:31,330
everybody and I don't recommend it to
people who are in bad situations in their

2422
02:25:31,331 --> 02:25:33,250
relationship or stressed out,
but,

2423
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:37,420
but if you got your ducks in order and
you're in a good place with a nice person,

2424
02:25:37,421 --> 02:25:40,450
having a kid is a crazy
experience when you're, you know,

2425
02:25:40,451 --> 02:25:42,760
when you could just see
it's going to be hard times.

2426
02:25:42,761 --> 02:25:46,360
But when you get to hang out with this
little person that you literally love

2427
02:25:46,361 --> 02:25:47,650
more than you love your own life,

2428
02:25:47,651 --> 02:25:50,170
like you would sacrifice your own
life in order to keep them happy.

2429
02:25:50,350 --> 02:25:54,190
It's a very strange thing.
It's like as an entertainer,

2430
02:25:54,191 --> 02:25:55,600
I'm sure you guys can relate to this,

2431
02:25:55,660 --> 02:25:59,560
especially being around a lot of other
entertainers, you guys are very balanced,

2432
02:25:59,561 --> 02:26:04,510
but not a lot of us are. You
know, a lot of us are very
me, me, me, me, me, you know,

2433
02:26:04,511 --> 02:26:06,550
and it's really hard to get past that.

2434
02:26:06,551 --> 02:26:11,050
There's a lot of selfish ideas out there
in the world of art and creativity.

2435
02:26:11,350 --> 02:26:16,060
And one of the things that's been little
really freeing to me is to actually

2436
02:26:16,510 --> 02:26:19,870
have someone in my life, you
know, have people in my life,

2437
02:26:19,871 --> 02:26:21,590
not just one gang.

2438
02:26:21,620 --> 02:26:25,480
These little people that I literally
love more than I liked me. You know,

2439
02:26:25,481 --> 02:26:29,350
I want more for them than
for me. And that's, I always
thought that was bullshit.

2440
02:26:29,650 --> 02:26:32,830
I always thought that was what people said
because they wanted to hear people go,

2441
02:26:32,860 --> 02:26:37,090
aw, he's so sensitive. Oh he's so yoga.

2442
02:26:38,760 --> 02:26:42,510
You know what I mean? It sounds
like horse shit. But then when you,

2443
02:26:42,840 --> 02:26:47,040
you understand the actual relationship
between a parent and a child,

2444
02:26:47,430 --> 02:26:50,010
it's not just a little human being.

2445
02:26:50,011 --> 02:26:54,720
It's a little human being that is a part
of you. I mean they, they, they literally,

2446
02:26:54,721 --> 02:26:58,590
if it's not, you could never
understand it unless it's yours. The,

2447
02:26:58,591 --> 02:27:02,600
that biological switches that go
off of very strange, you know, like,

2448
02:27:02,601 --> 02:27:03,434
so your whole,

2449
02:27:04,170 --> 02:27:09,170
your whole feeling about love in general
changes when you have children and my

2450
02:27:09,181 --> 02:27:13,080
whole outlook on human beings
because once I had children,

2451
02:27:13,081 --> 02:27:15,990
I changed the way I looked at everybody.
I didn't,

2452
02:27:15,991 --> 02:27:18,200
I don't look at adults as adults anymore.

2453
02:27:18,420 --> 02:27:21,630
I look at adults as
babies that became adults.

2454
02:27:22,290 --> 02:27:26,820
I look at adults as like these bundles
of potential that slowly but surely

2455
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:31,380
became a grown up human being. What
are you playing to Brian? No baby.

2456
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:36,150
You play in babies eating and lemons.
Have you given your babies the lemons yet?

2457
02:27:36,180 --> 02:27:41,100
Yeah, they're like lemmings.
They eat them. It's weird.
Yeah. They make that face.

2458
02:27:41,101 --> 02:27:42,250
Then they bite down chew.

2459
02:27:47,020 --> 02:27:49,950
There's a whole community of
baby's eating lemon grass.

2460
02:27:52,150 --> 02:27:56,470
It's okay because it's not painful,
but it is kinda crazy. You know,

2461
02:27:56,471 --> 02:27:58,840
like you don't feel like the kids
getting tortured because look,

2462
02:27:58,841 --> 02:28:03,250
they still ate it. They don't wipe
their mouth or they just go, Whoa,

2463
02:28:04,750 --> 02:28:06,700
that was a lie.
A kid's a pussy.

2464
02:28:07,510 --> 02:28:11,290
I kid freaked out from a wine lambs.
Aren't even that bad. You little fuck.

2465
02:28:11,680 --> 02:28:14,350
When I was a kid we had to walk 20
miles in the snow just to get a line.

2466
02:28:18,340 --> 02:28:21,380
You feel like we are, we're in the
right groove now. We might gotten there.

2467
02:28:21,540 --> 02:28:21,980
All right.

2468
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:24,920
What's this next song? Well, it's uh,

2469
02:28:28,860 --> 02:28:32,160
it's, it's kind of called,
it's got a weird name.

2470
02:28:32,550 --> 02:28:35,760
I'm not sure if this is what we're
going to call it, but the, the courses,

2471
02:28:35,761 --> 02:28:40,590
which are you going to do now? And it's
not like water, like spelling it out,

2472
02:28:40,620 --> 02:28:44,250
you know? So like what, this is
not even named yet. Not really. No.

2473
02:28:44,490 --> 02:28:48,110
So to have a chance to hear a
silence, not even name, maybe,

2474
02:28:48,120 --> 02:28:50,330
maybe you can name it Joe,
and that'll, that'll be,

2475
02:28:50,331 --> 02:28:54,150
maybe we'll ask the people on Twitter,

It's so great song that Ben
wrote and I think it's awesome.

2523
02:34:21,490 --> 02:34:24,940
Why you think it's a bummer?
Because of the lyrics and how it sounds,

2524
02:34:26,710 --> 02:34:27,550
but what else?
What?

2573
02:39:40,490 --> 02:39:42,870
Oh my God. Yeah. I don't mind
trainees but not that kind of,

2574
02:39:42,900 --> 02:39:45,050
that's a little strong
going the other way.

2575
02:39:46,840 --> 02:39:50,080
Yes. There's, there's different ways
to slice it. No Pun intended. Oh,

2576
02:39:50,190 --> 02:39:51,310
you're okay with the other group?

2577
02:39:52,410 --> 02:39:55,410
Uh, more compatible with the
men who want to be women.

2578
02:39:55,620 --> 02:39:59,460
Then with the women who want to be men.
Those confused me. More, more compatible

2579
02:40:02,260 --> 02:40:05,930
PC way. We'll have you looked at
it like what would you as a man,

2580
02:40:05,960 --> 02:40:08,930
what would you choose? We have to wrap
this up soon. What would you choose?

2581
02:40:08,931 --> 02:40:13,931
Would you rather be the the man who dates
the man who used to be a woman but is

2582
02:40:16,051 --> 02:40:19,120
now a man or you know what I mean?
Like fucking,

2583
02:40:21,120 --> 02:40:24,720
I should ask Ben,
would you rather be a date?

2584
02:40:24,750 --> 02:40:29,750
Would you rather date of bucking Joe
who's clearly very manly but has a vagina

2585
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:33,600
or like a little tie,
little Thai boy,

2586
02:40:35,080 --> 02:40:38,010
a twinkie type situation.
That'd be careful

2587
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:42,000
who becomes a woman.
You would rather have that right?

2588
02:40:42,220 --> 02:40:45,570
Who would rather have a man who
like at least looks like a woman?

2589
02:40:45,990 --> 02:40:50,520
You're saying like a manly vagina
having Ryan or a buck angels.

2590
02:40:50,521 --> 02:40:54,750
Truly a man. Truly a man, but not
really, really is a woman has a vagina.

2591
02:40:55,050 --> 02:41:00,050
Would you rather have that or would you
rather have a guy who used to be a guy

2592
02:41:01,380 --> 02:41:04,130
but wanting to be a girl? Always felt
he was a girl but really looks like

2593
02:41:04,280 --> 02:41:06,130
girl when I talked to them.

2594
02:41:06,410 --> 02:41:09,240
Are they going to listen to you and
what are we going to talk about that?

2595
02:41:09,250 --> 02:41:13,810
Don't you have friends? What's going
on? Surely want out of a relationship.

2596
02:41:13,811 --> 02:41:16,280
You want them to listen to you.
They get a dog man talks,

2597
02:41:16,281 --> 02:41:19,600
I listened to you and they don't have
to fund. Got Larry Bird and Larry Bird.

2598
02:41:20,260 --> 02:41:23,380
Maybe Larry Berg will talk to you.
You won't need a relationship anymore.

2599
02:41:23,410 --> 02:41:27,970
Just jerk off Larry Bird and your life
and cut all the complications out man

2600
02:41:28,030 --> 02:41:30,400
between twinks a short transsexual,
right?

2601
02:41:30,430 --> 02:41:34,540
No twinks or a little gay
fellows who a are, you know,

2602
02:41:34,541 --> 02:41:38,830
fairly non muscular and very boy like

2603
02:41:39,670 --> 02:41:44,080
Oh.

2605
02:41:46,840 --> 02:41:49,630
He prepared that one in his
shitty little mine for like

2606
02:41:51,730 --> 02:41:55,350
20 seconds for like an hour.
He was rolling a while

2607
02:41:56,550 --> 02:42:00,460
introduced that one
bitch by batch.

Yes.

2624
02:43:12,610 --> 02:43:14,380
You son

2625
02:43:14,550 --> 02:43:19,200
of a bitch. Settle the fuck down. Okay.

2626
02:43:19,480 --> 02:43:21,720
Uh,
this show essentially is over.

2627
02:43:22,440 --> 02:43:26,190
This is a fun one. It got
dark, but it was, that was good

2628
02:43:26,590 --> 02:43:30,250
being on it. You know, if,
uh, if it wasn't for you guys,

2629
02:43:30,430 --> 02:43:31,780
we probably would've never went down.

2630
02:43:31,781 --> 02:43:33,930
The road of musical guests
has been really fun.

2631
02:43:35,010 --> 02:43:39,400
Balls of steel, whatever it was, was it,
he was in the fucking stars for us guys.

2632
02:43:39,420 --> 02:43:40,470
Yeah,
I think it was.

2633
02:43:41,220 --> 02:43:43,740
It was a, I mean the guy,
if you don't know the story,

2634
02:43:43,741 --> 02:43:46,430
a guy am I messed up or sent me a message,
a personal message,

2635
02:43:46,440 --> 02:43:48,150
said this is going to
be a new favorite band.

2636
02:43:48,420 --> 02:43:52,710
And it was you guys playing angel of death
on the top of a roof somewhere and in

2637
02:43:52,711 --> 02:43:55,680
la. And it was an acoustic version
of it. And I was like, wow,

2638
02:43:56,160 --> 02:43:58,490
these guys are fucking good.
And then I just started,

2639
02:43:58,500 --> 02:44:02,370
I think I saw my little toy gun.
I think that was the next song I saw.

2640
02:44:02,371 --> 02:44:05,490
And I just watched a bunch of your
videos and I'm like, Holy Shit,

2641
02:44:05,491 --> 02:44:06,324
these guys are awesome.

2642
02:44:06,480 --> 02:44:09,240
And somehow or another we all got
together and now we're besties.

2643
02:44:09,350 --> 02:44:12,310
It's pretty awesome. We are. I like what's
happening here guys. It's beautiful.

2644
02:44:12,311 --> 02:44:12,551
You know,

2645
02:44:12,551 --> 02:44:15,670
this is one of the coolest things about
the internet is the ability to connect

2646
02:44:15,671 --> 02:44:20,230
people. The other cool thing,
stalkers, that's not, oh,

2647
02:44:20,260 --> 02:44:21,520
that's cool.

2648
02:44:22,420 --> 02:44:26,260
I'm being facetious. That's the problem
with the ability to connect people.

2649
02:44:26,261 --> 02:44:28,660
Some people are just not fully developed.
They're not ready.

2650
02:44:28,890 --> 02:44:30,780
Can I know for others,
not,

2651
02:44:30,781 --> 02:44:34,930
not to segue from stockers at all because
that was like a wrong place to go from.

2652
02:44:34,950 --> 02:44:39,950
But I do want to have a little shout
out and a thank you to all the amazing

2653
02:44:40,501 --> 02:44:42,720
death squad fans that
have come to our shows.

2654
02:44:42,721 --> 02:44:45,450
There's some incredible people
that we've met on our, on our,

2655
02:44:45,560 --> 02:44:48,720
it'd be thanking a death squad during our
travels and think about how weird that

2656
02:44:48,721 --> 02:44:50,630
is.
I'd like to thank the desk.

2657
02:44:50,631 --> 02:44:53,940
Why can't you ever think those words would
come here? I don't think I would know.

2658
02:44:54,150 --> 02:44:56,370
Well, they never thought we would
call ourselves a desk quad either.

2659
02:44:56,371 --> 02:44:58,380
So why do you call them the death squad?

2660
02:44:58,800 --> 02:45:03,450
We're on the opiate Anthony show. What
was it, 2006 or some shit like that. Yeah.

2661
02:45:03,540 --> 02:45:06,540
And uh, oop, when we walked in,

2662
02:45:06,541 --> 02:45:09,660
I walked in with Tate Fletcher's big
giant dude from the ultimate fighter,

2663
02:45:09,700 --> 02:45:11,310
good buddy of ours.
And uh,

2664
02:45:11,640 --> 02:45:16,120
Eddie Bravo who's a black belt in
Brazilian Jujitsu and Opie goes, oh,

2665
02:45:16,121 --> 02:45:18,740
here's Joe Rogan. He brought
in the death squad. Like,

2666
02:45:18,990 --> 02:45:23,890
like there's these people that were
killers and we just as a joke start a

2667
02:45:23,891 --> 02:45:27,450
calling ourselves a desk squad,
you know, because he said that.

2668
02:45:27,690 --> 02:45:32,430
And then Brian started desk squad
podcast network and it's sort of spread

2669
02:45:32,431 --> 02:45:32,701
through that.

2670
02:45:32,701 --> 02:45:35,730
And then Brian started selling the desk
squad tee shirts and then people showed

2671
02:45:35,731 --> 02:45:38,850
up at shows and they're all wearing these
desk squad tee shirts and now people

2672
02:45:38,851 --> 02:45:42,810
like put Hashtag [inaudible] Hashtag
[inaudible] the yeah, it's crazy.

2673
02:45:42,840 --> 02:45:44,790
And Brian does like desk squad shows,

2674
02:45:44,940 --> 02:45:47,000
he calls it the comedy
shows desk watch shows.

2675
02:45:47,430 --> 02:45:50,790
It just was a crazy thing that
sorta just grew and became weird

2676
02:45:51,180 --> 02:45:53,930
like our group of friends.
But yeah, it's like our gang,

2677
02:45:53,970 --> 02:45:56,160
you know like we're approving like if,
if you're on the desk,

2678
02:45:56,161 --> 02:46:01,161
why but we pretty much approve of your
comedy or do physicians be in the dust?

2679
02:46:01,640 --> 02:46:03,710
Why? That's great. That's great guys.

2680
02:46:04,160 --> 02:46:09,160
100% death squad approved
unanimously voted now

2681
02:46:10,020 --> 02:46:12,000
herpes so happy.
It's still,

2682
02:46:12,001 --> 02:46:16,290
it's a noise but we don't really mean
the connotation of those words to connect

2683
02:46:16,291 --> 02:46:19,580
it together. Like death squad.
It became something else.

2684
02:46:19,610 --> 02:46:21,920
And even though it has that name,
we don't think of any.

2685
02:46:21,921 --> 02:46:24,410
There's no death involved.
You know, there's no squad.

2686
02:46:24,770 --> 02:46:28,340
It's like a bunch of silly happy people,
you know,

2687
02:46:28,450 --> 02:46:33,150
but they're just ironically call
themselves desk with the Highland Kathy.

2688
02:46:33,200 --> 02:46:35,300
That really does it tomorrow,

2689
02:46:35,301 --> 02:46:40,301
Ladies and gentlemen will be our
300th mother fucking episode.

2690
02:46:42,110 --> 02:46:42,681
Yes,

2691
02:46:42,681 --> 02:46:47,681
you guys were to 99 and joining us
tomorrow will be none other than the Great

2692
02:46:48,110 --> 02:46:51,620
Joey Coco Diaz allegedly cock sucker.
He never know what Joey,

2693
02:46:51,950 --> 02:46:54,680
you never know what's going to happen.
It's part of the fun and it's,

2694
02:46:54,770 --> 02:46:58,130
it's also baby too. You never
know if he's night. Joey Diaz,

2695
02:46:58,131 --> 02:47:00,410
his wife is about to hatch.

2696
02:47:01,240 --> 02:47:05,290
I'm knew Joey d a female.
Joey Diaz,

2697
02:47:05,870 --> 02:47:08,360
who will no doubt be the
funniest girl in preschool.

2698
02:47:09,420 --> 02:47:12,070
It's going to come out of Joey.
I took her to babysit their kid tonight.

2699
02:47:12,100 --> 02:47:15,110
I'm cracking jokes right away.
It's going to be very interesting.

2700
02:47:15,111 --> 02:47:18,740
Joey will be with us Friday night at
the Wiltern honey, honey, Joey Diaz,

2701
02:47:18,770 --> 02:47:21,890
Doug's Stan hope and me. It's going
to be awesome. And, uh, listen,

2702
02:47:21,891 --> 02:47:24,230
I got all these emails from all these
different people saying they're coming

2703
02:47:24,231 --> 02:47:27,080
from all over the world. We appreciate
the fuck out of that. And we're,

2704
02:47:27,081 --> 02:47:29,390
we're very excited and I'm
so glad that we, we, we,

2705
02:47:29,630 --> 02:47:34,190
Doug and I talked about
doing this probably in 2003
when we first started doing

2706
02:47:34,270 --> 02:47:36,950
our shitty version of the man show and
we said we should have an end of the

2707
02:47:36,951 --> 02:47:41,330
world party and a, and we're doing
it Joe rogan.net, my comedy special.

2708
02:47:41,331 --> 02:47:42,530
It's already out.
It's supposed to.

2709
02:47:42,531 --> 02:47:44,090
I'm supposed to not talk
about it til tomorrow,

2710
02:47:44,091 --> 02:47:47,330
but a bunch of people have already saw
it on Twitter while this podcast was

2711
02:47:47,331 --> 02:47:51,090
going on and said they loved it. Which
uh, uh, I'm very happy here. I'm,

2712
02:47:51,091 --> 02:47:54,500
I'm really happy for it. I don't, I
would never put it out of its socket.

2713
02:47:54,890 --> 02:47:55,850
I worked really hard on,

2714
02:47:55,851 --> 02:48:00,110
this is like a good solid
year of preparation and uh,

2715
02:48:00,200 --> 02:48:04,340
and then it was a long time to set up
the infrastructure to sell this and to be

2716
02:48:04,341 --> 02:48:08,450
able to distribute it online. Uh, what
Louis Ck did is a real game changer.

2717
02:48:08,451 --> 02:48:10,610
It sort of changed the way a
lot of people, especially the,

2718
02:48:10,890 --> 02:48:13,600
certainly the way I think about it.
Um,

2719
02:48:13,850 --> 02:48:17,240
releasing things like this was never
even an option or consideration until we

2720
02:48:17,241 --> 02:48:19,910
started doing this podcast. So thank
you very much. We appreciate it.

2721
02:48:19,911 --> 02:48:22,730
The fuck out of you guys.
We were all in this together.

2722
02:48:22,760 --> 02:48:26,480
It's helping me as much as it's
helping you guys. I swear to God,

2723
02:48:27,610 --> 02:48:30,560
I'm gonna believe in God and I swear
to him, I swear I believe in Odin

2724
02:48:32,640 --> 02:48:35,360
and sent him praise. Praise
Odin. Ladies and gentlemen.

2725
02:48:35,420 --> 02:48:39,070
It's not that I don't believe in
God. Let me read it. Said I don't, I,

2726
02:48:39,270 --> 02:48:42,980
I don't believe in him and I don't
not believe in him. If he was there,

2727
02:48:43,400 --> 02:48:46,640
I wouldn't be shocked.
I wouldn't be shocked.

2728
02:48:47,030 --> 02:48:51,530
Life itself is fucking crazy as
an operating system could be.

2729
02:48:51,980 --> 02:48:54,460
God could be the,
the guy who programmed the simulation.

2730
02:48:54,470 --> 02:48:58,910
It can be some autistic kid in Seattle,
the fucking laptop. All right, you fucks.

2731
02:48:58,940 --> 02:49:03,440
Look, we loved that Shit Outta Ya. We're
sending out positive messages to you.

2732
02:49:03,740 --> 02:49:06,530
Take them in and do with them what
you will and we'll see you tomorrow.

2733
02:49:07,800 --> 02:49:12,800
[inaudible].
