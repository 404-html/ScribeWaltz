1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,460
Real good experience.

2
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,593
Can we are

3
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,280
flying Ocean Pacific flying above
the Pacific. I'm with Dana White.

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,410
What's up? Tony has gone hello
everybody. And uh, we're uh,

5
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,650
basically we were in shock right now.
No one,

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,430
no one here should be allowed to vote.
They shouldn't be allowed to drive.

7
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,940
We should all be forced to settle in.
Don't make any rash decisions.

8
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,020
Like right now we're dealing with a,
this is a crazy time. We just got,

9
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,300
we just got done watching.

10
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,440
It might not be the biggest
upset in combat sports history.

11
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:51,790
I know I said it after the fight.

12
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,080
I think Buster Douglas might've been a
bigger upset because buster Douglas was

13
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:59,530
kind of a fuck up.
He was kind of a guy who didn't,

14
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,740
didn't really train hard,
didn't take care of himself,

15
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,070
and he was a 42 to one underdog
when he knocked out Mike Tyson.

16
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,080
Holly Holm was only a 12 to one underdog
when she knocked out Rhonda and Holly

17
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,620
was, you know, very respected
in the combat sports world,

18
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,440
multiple time boxing,
world kickboxing champion,

19
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:21,490
but still on Twitter when I was hyping
this fight off and I was telling people

20
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:24,970
about this fight, so many people saying,
you're trying to sell us bullshit.

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,620
You know Holly doesn't have a chance.

22
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,190
Freddie Roach said Ronda Rousey is
going to destroyer and it was all these

23
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:33,640
articles and you just going.
So it was an upset,

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,540
but it wasn't just that it was an
opposite. It was the way she did it,

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,920
the way she did though.

26
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,750
She fought the perfect fight and when
she had kicked Ronda, just the icing,

27
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,970
the cherry on the cake,

28
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,110
goodnight everybody and hammer fist
at her when she was out. I mean,

29
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,210
we're all shocked.
I'm in shock

30
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,060
placement shot.

31
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,060
I mean there's a reason right now why
literally my phone at four o'clock in the

32
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:03,770
morning was going crazy. Every
media outlet on earth, I mean,

33
00:02:03,771 --> 00:02:08,630
you name it, my Dave Sholler,
our Pr Guy said, pick a,

34
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:11,930
pick an outlet. Say it. Just say
something to pull it, pull the name out,

35
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,390
they call it, and they want either hollow
Holly, Rhonda, they want to talk to him.

36
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,710
I,
and I was saying earlier to you guys,

37
00:02:18,711 --> 00:02:21,720
it's like patriots looking
good this season. They just,

38
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,130
they just went nine to know did
they could win another Superbowl.

39
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:30,110
The world will not go fucking crazy
the way the world went when to,

40
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:35,150
you know, went to bad ass human being
square off and, and uh, and uh, and uh,

41
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,380
you know, combat fight in the
world goes fucking crazy man.

42
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,070
We're not used to women doing that.
And if we are using, there's a,

43
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,140
there was like a brief moment in the past
or Christy Martin got big of the coal

44
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:53,280
miner's daughter and she used to box
on TV and she would have these kinds of

45
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:53,521
fights.

46
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:56,520
But one of the things about watching
women fight was they didn't really knock

47
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:59,980
each other out. They sort of beat
each other. They had each other. But

48
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,120
when when Holly head kicked her
on the last night, he was like,

49
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,590
it wasn't just that she beat her,
it was just that one.

50
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:12,310
It was such a superstar. When such
a superstar gets beaten like that,

51
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,870
the whole Russ to go, what? It's like when
buster Douglas knocked out Mike Tyson.

52
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,590
It wasn't that a guy got knocked out.
Everybody knows guys can knock guys out.

53
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,660
We've seen Mike Tyson
knock out a hundred guys.

54
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:26,750
It's not that it was at Mike
Tyson got knocked out. What? What?

55
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,070
What's like it didn't fit in our
paradigm of how the world works.

56
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,410
The world works. Ronda Rousey runs out,
grabs girls, throws them on their head,

57
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,740
armbars bars or she needs the most
dominant punches him in the face.

58
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,670
Takes him out to see that
happen the way it happened.

59
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:47,671
To See Holly Holm fight the perfect
fight and be so classy to all through the

60
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:53,650
media, everything. She did cool as
a cucumber during the weigh ins.

61
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,480
Rhonda screaming at her in her face,

62
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:59,710
everything Holly was stone faced
never changed her expression.

63
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,150
I mean the whole day,

64
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,170
it's almost the same feeling,
not the same feeling,

65
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,320
but almost the same feeling that I got
on nine 11 watching this Cheyenne trade

66
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:11,950
centers come down. No, I'm serious.

67
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:16,180
I mean we knew when the trade centers got
hit by planes, we were like, holy fuck.

68
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,400
But when you watched him actually
come down and you're like,

69
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:22,930
there's no way something that's solid
and that stabilized and strong and

70
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:24,790
powerful is coming down right now.

71
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,610
And that's how I felt when
the leg kick happened.

72
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,460
Like I felt like if there was a
delayed reaction from everybody,

73
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:33,490
like people are like, oh yeah, she
just got head kicked and she went down,

74
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:35,980
but it's up over.
It's not really over.

75
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,430
And until the graph and tell
her dean wave that hand,

76
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,260
I still think it took 10 2030 seconds
before people really realize what was

77
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:45,094
happening.

78
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,630
I was outlining it before the fight and
what was funny was all these people on

79
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:52,900
Twitter were like, you know, you
try to show us just bullshit.

80
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:55,780
We're already watching. Stop trying
to sell. It's bullshit. You know,

81
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:58,780
Ron is going to kill her.
But as I'm outlining it,

82
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,620
I'm outlining kicks.
I'm talking about old bleak kicks.

83
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:07,621
I'm talking about movement and distance
and Holly Holmes striking credentials

84
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,780
and like this is, this is a complicated
fight for Ronda in this space.

85
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,380
It really sunk in with me when
I saw her at the weigh ins.

86
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,540
You could tell that
she realized like this,

87
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,300
even though Holly wasn't
doing anything disrespectful,

88
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,250
she wanted to get this emotional,

89
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:29,230
she wanted to turn this into
something like very, very
personal and she, you know,

90
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,900
I don't know what was going on,
but Rhonda was,

91
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,270
you know when you do that
at the day of the weigh ins,

92
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,440
you're trying to get in their head,

93
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:40,441
do trying to rattle or shake her up and
Holly was not rattled or shaken one bit

94
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,670
at all exchange.

95
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,700
What was the other thing that we were
talking about during the broadcast?

96
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:47,140
We're saying like this is a girl who's,

97
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,300
she's faced intense pressure before world
championship pressure and boxing and

98
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:56,770
kickboxing. She's been there, man, she's,
we're shooting all over this fight.

99
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,010
I kept saying,
I did

100
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,220
a radio tour the week we
left for Australia. I said,

101
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:06,320
these girls had 45 fights and
had multiple world titles there.

102
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,040
There's a, there's a
sense of, of uh, you know,

103
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,900
experience and,
and,

104
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:16,370
and this just calm feeling even though
she's going in against Ronda Rousey and

105
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:17,480
Rhonda is,
you know,

106
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:23,480
I guess now you could say she was really
the female Tyson for or for the sport

107
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,110
because of the way everybody's
reacting to her a loss. But you know,

108
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,720
this girl has a lot of
experience, man. It's,

109
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:33,950
it's a big deal and she has the distance
to range. She has great head kicks,

110
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,580
you know, and good hands. This
was, this was a great fight.

111
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:38,840
This was the fight to make.

112
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,860
Well, you know, what it was is
that she didn't come into our own,

113
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,720
in the UFC until this fight.

114
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,500
Like even though she looked great and
other organizations and should not be out

115
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,040
when she fought in the UFC,
the few fights she had in the UFC,

116
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,700
she was still trying to find her footing.
Like in the Raquel Pennington fight.

117
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,730
She looked good but she didn't
look like a world beater.

118
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,490
It's like we talk about this all the time,

119
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:06,491
but being in the UFC is such
an overwhelming experience
for fighters that it

120
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:11,570
takes them several fights like Kyle
Noke, like Kyle. No cause had what,

121
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:13,450
10 fights in the UFC.
I don't remember.

122
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,600
I don't even know how many fights
that in the EOC, but last night, Tom,

123
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:21,380
into his own last night when
Kyle Noke fought Sabata,

124
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,730
he came into his own, he landed that,
he looked fantastic, land that front,

125
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:29,180
kick the body and said to himself
a lot when I was interviewing him,

126
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,860
he's finally believe it in themselves.

127
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,020
It takes a while to get
comfortable in there.

128
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,980
The other thing to this sport
and this sport, it's so different

129
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,170
to coach. This is, we're on a plane
right now. What's your name, ma'am?

130
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,180
To sell and just though is, uh, the flight
attendant. Thank you very much, ma'am.

131
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,770
Would you change that to eight
together? I'll blackjack JB on. Yeah.

132
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:55,700
We'll pause this for a moment. We'll
come back in a little bit. Yeah. Oh,

133
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:58,880
you're going to set up the tray right now.
Is that what you're doing? Okay. Okay.

134
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,990
Thanks. All right. Thank you.
Just so well. The other thing is

135
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,370
that in this sport,
and we say this all the time,

136
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:09,890
there's so many different
ways to win and lose and um,

137
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:15,730
it's so hard to be perfect all the time
of the sport to go undefeated and go on

138
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:18,880
these long runs for 10
years like Josie Aldo,

139
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:22,340
or as long as the Anderson Silva did,
or as long as Ronda Rousey did,

140
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,600
it is hard to be perfect
every time you go in there.

141
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,690
Because I don't care how
good of an athlete you are.

142
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,310
How long have you been competing?

143
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,390
Not everybody jumps out of bed every
day and feels perfect and feels good.

144
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,110
The timing is on your body feels
right. You know, it, it just,

145
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,430
it's not possible for that to
happen all the time. It's for,

146
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,010
that's why when people go on these
undefeated runs in this sport, they are,

147
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,550
they're fucking great.
They're truly great. Uh,

148
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,650
and then you take all the things about
physically not being perfect then had the

149
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:58,590
pressure and the workload that gets put
on you when you become a UFC champion.

150
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,040
Ronda Rousey did it better
than anybody's ever done it.

151
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,050
The amount of work and the time she put
in how hard she trained the things that

152
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:07,700
she would do.

153
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,950
She didn't become a huge superstar the
way that she did for no reason. She,

154
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:15,900
she worked at it. And you see Conor work
at it and these guys that, that, that, uh,

155
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,080
that can go on these long runs
or are very unique individuals,

156
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:24,320
pressure that she's under and the
pressure and the distractions, you know,

157
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,270
when you see her and all those media
events move all seen her on all these

158
00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:32,410
different talk shows and all these
magazine articles. Is that yours?

159
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,380
Oh my God. It is like,
listen to this song.

160
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,860
He's got his beats headphones blaring,
but the,

161
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,900
when you see all these things,

162
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,250
I tune into them and I,
I see them,

163
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,420
but I don't think of how many she's doing
that. I'm aware of them. You know, if,

164
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:53,110
if someone's aware of, if you're
aware of someone on the tonight show,

165
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:55,240
if you're aware of someone
in a rolling stone article,

166
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,410
think about how many things they're
doing that you're not aware how much shit

167
00:09:59,411 --> 00:10:03,160
Rhonda is doing all day long constantly.
Or phones blowing up.

168
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,490
Media requests constantly.
People asking her to do things

169
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,200
and you know,
you know,

170
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,830
most people don't realize they look
at somebody and go home, big deal.

171
00:10:11,831 --> 00:10:14,830
You got to do interviews,
you got to do this. It sucks.

172
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:18,370
A lot of energy I imagine doing
that stuff is very time consuming.

173
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,820
You always have to be on, there's
tons of preparation that goes into it.

174
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,880
The travel that's needed to
do it. It's, it's a, it's a,

175
00:10:24,881 --> 00:10:27,760
it's a heavy workload when you're,
when you become the champion.

176
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,070
Let's a heavy workload

177
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,170
guy like you who doesn't have to fight.
It's a heavy workload.

178
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,470
Constantly doing interviews for
someone who has to fight and you have

179
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:39,340
preparation, you have to train, you have
to eat right, you have to sleep right.

180
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,970
You have to make sure that you get
all of your physical preparation in.

181
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,750
I mean the, the, it's, it's, it's
a massive, massive distraction.

182
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,230
Carlos Barsa we'll call those
bars. Uh, um, you know, one top,

183
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,750
she was the champion. She,
we started putting her on,

184
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:57,210
she had to do media than we
needed her to defend her title.

185
00:10:57,211 --> 00:11:01,670
And she started to freak out early.
Like, I, this is, this is, um,

186
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,100
to this too much. I'm, I'm breaking down.
I just got off the ultimate fighter.

187
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:06,540
I trained for this fight.

188
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,220
I won the show and now I've
got to defend the time.

189
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,750
I got to go back and just people start,
you know,

190
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,620
Rhonda said this quote this
last week, she said, um,

191
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,990
these people who think they want to be
the world champion have no idea what it

192
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:25,690
really takes to be the world
champion. And it's so true. You know,

193
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:29,990
I remember when Bj Penn beat Matt Hughes
when I was interviewing Matt in the

194
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:33,170
Octagon and Matt was very
candid and very honest,

195
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:36,350
and I really admire the way he
approached it because no one's ever,

196
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,320
I never interviewed anybody before and
they talked about it like that. He said,

197
00:11:39,321 --> 00:11:41,780
honestly,
losing as a relief.

198
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,070
He said it was a just a tremendous amount
of pressure being the champ and having

199
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:50,630
all these people coming after me. And,
uh, honestly it was a relief from my wow,

200
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,010
what a ballsy guy he is
to admit that bite. That

201
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,630
what an honest guy.
It's so true. Th th the,

202
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,630
the amount of pressure that these guys
are under and the workload and then you

203
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:03,400
take Rhonda and you had
movies on top of it.

204
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,810
She's doing movies on top of it and books
and going on book tours and all this

205
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:12,280
stuff. It's, it's, it's a,
it's a lot of work for anybody.
And uh, like I said, she,

206
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:14,860
she did it better than anybody's
ever done it. She really did.

207
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,980
Now when you look at
the fight stylistically,

208
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,010
that's one of the crazy things
about fights. Um, you know,

209
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:24,970
you can get a guy like Floyd Mayweather
figures out how to box people and get to

210
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:26,410
a 49 to no record,

211
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,880
but to figure out how to beat every
different style of martial artists.

212
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,540
When you're talking about takedowns
leg kicks, all these different things.

213
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,990
We had talked about the one thing that
we hadn't seen Rhonda deal with with

214
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:41,710
someone who knows how to kick and we
really had cats in Ghana was the only

215
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:46,360
possibility. And Kat just made
a, a crazy mistake and rushed.

216
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:48,880
Rhonda got caught in a
scramble and got arm barred.

217
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,730
But what Holly Holm was able to do,

218
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:55,840
it was the first time we ever saw
anybody knows how to kick keep her on the

219
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,600
outside. A lot of
movement, a lot of kicking.

220
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,700
And that's kind of missing in Vonda's
game. The, the, the kicking aspect,

221
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:06,910
we really, I don't, I don't recall
ever seeing or throw a kick.

222
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,430
I mean if she has maybe one or two ever.
I mean if you,

223
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,670
do you remember seeing her
kick? Yeah. I don't know.

224
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,020
The thing is is that Ronda was a fucking
tornado and ripping through everybody,

225
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:19,660
like in seconds. Um, you know,

226
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:24,661
so he probably don't get to see her full
name or what she's got in last night.

227
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,590
You know,
last night was just craziness south.

228
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,600
So it's tough to to sit back and look
at game play because the other thing is

229
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,500
what are you going to do with holidays
now you can look back and said, well,

230
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,620
she probably should have tried to grapple
with or she should maybe try to double

231
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:44,860
leg or getting the clinch, take her down,
do this, that and everything else. But,

232
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,390
but that's not Rhonda. Rhonda
is, I'm going to go out on
a fucking bang with you.

233
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:51,280
I'm going to try to try to throw you off.

234
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:54,160
I get the opportunity to throw
you off throw you. She just,

235
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,730
she never got any opportunities.
She got into a couple of exchanges.

236
00:13:57,731 --> 00:14:00,580
She rocked Holly a couple of
times but she never really,

237
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,780
you think she blocked her? She did.
From what I remember seeing the fight,

238
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,680
I remembered seeing Holly look like she
got hurt a couple times in the fight by

239
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,030
Rhonda.
I didn't see that.

240
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:15,031
I remember seeing her charging after
Holly and maybe connecting a couple of

241
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:18,780
times at punches, but Holly was
always moving back and you know,

242
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:20,830
like when someone's moving
away and you hit them,

243
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,780
it doesn't have nearly as much him.
No doubt.

244
00:14:22,781 --> 00:14:26,740
She was on the outside and she was
picking her apart and hitting her with big

245
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:30,580
shots, planting up, planting and
then throwing that straight left.

246
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,260
No vin planting hit her with a shoulder
one time hitting her with hooks.

247
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,670
She hit her with a couple of those oblique
kick to the legs to jar your knees,

248
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,420
you know,

249
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,420
reminded me of watching an actual both
fight when the bull charges and the,

250
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:51,230
the matador hits that sword a couple
times. Like that's what it reminded of.

251
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,160
So you were saying

252
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,210
about the time where Rhonda

253
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,540
Yeah. Oh my God. When Rhonda missed that
one time and she turns around and looks,

254
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,920
it looked like a scene from a movie when
she misses stumbled. Yeah. She like,

255
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,120
she fell down and, and Holly just
ducked under him, was out of the way,

256
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,710
turned around and she had
a look on her face. Like,

257
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,200
who am I going against right now?

258
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,570
It's exactly what her face said
and she was wearing it and,

259
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,810
and I think that was a huge turning
point. I also think when, you know,

260
00:15:18,811 --> 00:15:23,811
I went crazy when Holly Holm took her
down cause they were clenched up and it

261
00:15:24,481 --> 00:15:28,620
looked like Rando was trying to get that
toss and all of a sudden Holly lifted

262
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:33,240
and sort of just did like a standing
double leg sort of then got her down.

263
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,150
It was, I think psychologically
a huge turning point. There was

264
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,830
clinch there at one point and they ended
up going down to the ground and Rhonda

265
00:15:40,831 --> 00:15:45,750
was trying to get an arm bar owner and
then Holly pulled out of it. Um, yeah,

266
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,110
I got to see the fight again. It
was, it was so fast and crazy.

267
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,940
We replayed the entire second round,
but the second rail,

268
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,390
she was already beaten up. We had time
and I was said to Bruce and the truck,

269
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,250
I was like, let's do the whole fight
again. Let's do the whole fight,

270
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,400
comment on it. And you know, with,

271
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,880
with the knowledge of what had happened
and because we're only dealing with,

272
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,270
you know, seven minutes, let's,
let's do this whole thing again.

273
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:11,110
But we wound up playing the second
round again and Rhonda came out for that

274
00:16:11,111 --> 00:16:15,070
second round already flustered already.
She was so tired.

275
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,190
Going back to that first round lake,
her legs were wobbly.

276
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,820
She was breathing heavy.
And I like Edmond.

277
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,940
I talked to Edmund all the time. I enjoyed
talking to him. I was a hug that guy.

278
00:16:24,941 --> 00:16:28,390
When I see him, I do not, I do not
like what he did in the corner.

279
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,750
He wasn't honest with her. He told
her she did great. He was like, great,

280
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:33,580
round champ. Everything's great. I mean,

281
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:35,830
maybe it was trying to
psychologically pump her up,

282
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:40,630
but that's not what you need to, I mean,
she needed technical advice. She needed,

283
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,200
she needed someone to tell her what
she's doing wrong and how to correct it.

284
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,610
Then I think, you know, I mean,

285
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:50,560
he's more of like a boxing coach
than he is an overall MMA coach.

286
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,720
Yeah. I mean, well, the thing
is, is that, uh, you, uh,

287
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,520
if it isn't broke, don't fix it. Right.
You know, that's a very good point.

288
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,010
The thing is now is as you know,
what do they do?

289
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:06,050
He listened to at the end of the day,
Edmunds,

290
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:09,200
a guy who really cares about
Rhonda and her career and you know,

291
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,950
all of that stuff. So I
think as it, as a team,

292
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:16,820
they'll sit down and try to figure out
what went wrong and what needs to be

293
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:17,654
fixed.

294
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,790
You know, and Tony, you had a great
point. We were at breakfast today.

295
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,040
You were like all these people on Twitter,

296
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:26,130
like they knew what was going to
happen. Oh, you knew he was, oh, well,

297
00:17:26,131 --> 00:17:27,930
I assume you bet everything you had there.

298
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,650
Yeah. Everybody wants to stay that they
knew what happened. Well then where's the,

299
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:33,484
where's your bedding?

300
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,540
Well, you want to know something?
Vegas went down last night.

301
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,590
A lot of people did bet on
Holly home last night. And um,

302
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:45,110
apparently there were some big college
football games last night with,

303
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,360
with huge spreads and they parlayed
Holly Holm and college game.

304
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,210
And this is what I heard,
I don't know if this is fact,

305
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:56,280
but this is what I heard
today here in Australia,

306
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,350
is that the Bellagio had to shut down
for over an hour because they didn't have

307
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:04,720
enough money in the cage to pay
everybody from the Holly Holm bets

308
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,280
that we, you know, and
there's some guy, uh,

309
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:15,810
his name's Vegas Dan or something
like that. He bet $25,000 on her.

310
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,250
Um, 2021 to 40. Yeah.

311
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,340
12 to one allegedly is going to
have to shut off their fountain.

312
00:18:24,341 --> 00:18:28,500
Save that water bill for a little
bit. Huh. They, uh, the other,

313
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:32,340
the other big bet that everybody was
taken was the over the over was around and

314
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:34,980
a half.
Yeah.

315
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,760
You know, it's, um, it's an
interesting situation because, uh,

316
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,590
I'd love Rhonda as a person.
I consider her a good friend.

317
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,980
I really like her and I
know you do too. And, uh,

318
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,740
as a person,

319
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,310
I'm sad for her loss that
this happened to her. Um,

320
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,270
but how home is a great person to,
you know,

321
00:18:57,271 --> 00:19:02,271
and there are two great competitors
and I think ultimately what happened

322
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,470
yesterday last night is great
for martial arts. You know,

323
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:12,420
and it's great for MMA because even though
it was terrible for Rhonda and I feel

324
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:15,870
terrible for her, I still,
I feel great for Holly Holm.

325
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:20,190
It's very con very conflicted. It's
like I'm trying to figure out when I'm,

326
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,620
when I'm interviewing Holly
in the inside the Octagon,

327
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,620
I'm going in there as a
person who cares about Rhonda.

328
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,360
It's tricky because this is the
biggest moment of Holly Holmes Life.

329
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,920
And I want to honor that and I want to
go in there and I am genuinely happy for

330
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:39,260
her while at the same time
genuinely sad for Rhonda and it,

331
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,253
but I can't,

332
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,090
I can't acknowledge that I
have to be happy for Holly.

333
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,910
And not only that, not only do
I have to, I, I wanna I want,

334
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,850
when I'm interviewing
someone inside the octagon,

335
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:55,680
I am trying my best to get them to
express themselves. I want Holly to set,

336
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,860
I mean this is the new
bantamweight champion of the world,

337
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,040
Holly Hall,

338
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,690
and she's got tears in her eyes and her
dad's dad and her husband's there and

339
00:20:06,691 --> 00:20:08,400
winkled John's there and everybody's down.

340
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:12,900
It says intense and tense moment and I
just want, I want to get that out of her.

341
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,810
While that was all happening
and I was thinking to myself,

342
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,250
what a good person she is because she's a,
even though you know,

343
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:24,510
like love Rhonda and I care about Rhonda,
like what a good person Holly Holm is,

344
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,670
you know, she's, she's just
like, you can't help feel
happy for her. That's true.

345
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,430
It's the, it's the crazy thing
about this business that we're in.

346
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,640
It's not just Holly and Ronda to every,
every,

347
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:40,230
every person that goes in there and
competes in the octagon both have these

348
00:20:40,231 --> 00:20:43,580
fucking dreams of,
of winning and glory and,

349
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,920
and world titles and money and all
the things that go along with it.

350
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,480
And then every fucking
weekend when we do a show,

351
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,130
one guy or girl moves forward and one
guy or girl moves backward. It's, it's,

352
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:58,390
it's a crazy thing in the
Holly Holm and her, her,

353
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,500
her father,

354
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:04,810
her husband and all the crew that was
around her could not have been better.

355
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:08,470
People could not have handled the
whole situation, but could it just,

356
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,120
I couldn't agree with you more.
Such a very, very good people. Um,

357
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,550
I went to the hospital last night and
I had Joanna young Jane check there.

358
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,260
I had Valerie Laterno there and that
Ronda Rousey there and I'm walking from

359
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:28,130
room to room going, Jesus Christ, this is
a crazy business more man. You know, it's,

360
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,750
it's just so crazy. These girls, you know,

361
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,380
even even Joanna as, uh, you know,

362
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,920
as dominant as she was last night, she
was hurt. She broke her hand, you know,

363
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,220
she broke her hand. Valerie,
what turnover is? Oh my God. Her,

364
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,690
I was massive. It, I'm serious.

365
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,870
It was the craziest thing that
I've ever seen her eyes last night

366
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,600
and I was so swollen by
the end of the fight,

367
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,670
I can only imagine all
looks like in a hostel.

368
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:59,120
Joe, it was so bad. So then I'm like,

369
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,670
how's your leg?

370
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,240
She looks at me and she pulls the
covers over and shows me her leg.

371
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,240
I've never seen anything like that.
It was,

372
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,660
I'm telling you that for a little
girl is banged up right now.

373
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:17,050
Took some hard, hard shots in her
leg and really kept kicking with it.

374
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:21,520
Kept coming forward. She is so
fucking tough left on top. So time,

375
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,740
the women are tougher than the madman.
Women.

376
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,800
Women have fucking
babies for Christ sakes.

377
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:30,310
They're way tougher than us where he
talked with them. Well, I'll tell you,

378
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,050
I'm so impressed.

379
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:36,520
First of all was a Latino's ability
to rise to the occasion too,

380
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,310
because that was the best
fight ever fought in her life,

381
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,700
or at least what I've seen in the octagon
and against Yolana who's a fucking

382
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,940
killer.
She's so good.

383
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:51,660
See, we always believed in Valerie
thought valor was good, big, strong,

384
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,180
115 pounder for that division.

385
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,470
Now she's at least going to sit
in the rankings where she belongs.

386
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,200
You know what I mean? She wasn't
ranked number eight. She's, she's,

387
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:04,230
she's better than that. Then she
approved it last night. Um, Joann,

388
00:23:04,231 --> 00:23:06,910
it's just bucking the monster.
Yeah.

389
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,720
She's so tough. She's so tough. And
Tony is in love with her, by the way.

390
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,460
Yeah. I'm in love with the
Ohana. If you're listening
right now, Johan, I love it.

391
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:18,950
Yeah. They don't call it
Johana then call Yohanna.

392
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:22,850
Yohanna. Yeah, it's no
age. There's no age.

393
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,020
Everybody pronounces it differently,
including her. I've heard,

394
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:30,090
I've seen her in different interviews and
say her name, toto six different ways.

395
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,750
Some of them, when you know, people would
start calling a yawn. A champion. Yeah.

396
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,870
They call it our champion now.

397
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,700
They don't even want to
fuck with young Jedd check.

398
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:41,530
It's like you try spelling it.
There's three people on the planet.

399
00:23:41,531 --> 00:23:42,540
They could spell her last name.

400
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,270
How bout she broke her hand and was
throwing punches right up until the bell,

401
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:51,530
like she didn't have a broken hand.
She's awesome, man. She's a beast.

402
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:55,480
She's a beast and she's arguably one of
the most technical strikers in him and

403
00:23:55,481 --> 00:23:58,400
made today. I know. She's
so good. Without a doubt.

404
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,420
And then going back to the HollyRod thing,
I mean, Holly and Ronda are the two,

405
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,430
the two best in the world
on a 35 pound division.

406
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,560
Holly Holm fought the perfect
fight last night, man.

407
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,690
As you sit and just think about
it and run it through your head,

408
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:18,500
fought the perfect fight and there
was so much going on to Rhonda.

409
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:22,250
Didn't want to touch gloves.
Were there all the animosity and the land?

410
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:24,410
We Lady Gaga came out today and said,

411
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:26,300
that's what happens when
you don't touch clubs.

412
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,440
Lady Gaga should know cause
she's been fighting for years.

413
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,990
She's been crazy. Fucking Donald
Trump. No, that's crazy. That's,

414
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,450
that's how big this fight was.

415
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,020
When you really try to wrap your
head around how big this fight was,

416
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,520
Donald Trump, who is running for
president tweeted a nasty tweet at Ronda.

417
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,540
Tell us, hey, the between,
uh, he said, uh, he said,

418
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,260
I'm glad Ronda Rousey lost last night.
She's not a good person.

419
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:59,720
And to help Donald Trump's
plane apparently was pissed
because he came out and

420
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:01,910
said that Rhonda was
endorsing him for president.

421
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,370
And then Rhonda came out
and said she was not well,

422
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:06,560
she said she was endorsing
Bernie Sanders and she,

423
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,140
which is ridiculous cause
she's rich. Rhonda, Rhonda,

424
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:16,770
I love you. But Bernie Sanders is that
there's a lunatic socialists then yeah,

425
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,100
he's going to take your
money. Right. You've got too
much money. Go with Hillary.

426
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,030
Had them hunter post to that.
I'm pretty Sanders.

427
00:25:26,031 --> 00:25:28,820
We'll take 90% of her wins as
soon as he's elected president.

428
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,380
He's got some ridiculous
ideas about wealth,

429
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:38,740
but I just can't imagine lady Gaga and
Donald Trump tweeting about an MMA fight.

430
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,650
Like how big this fight was this,

431
00:25:42,651 --> 00:25:47,651
this fight broke every record we've ever
had from the venue to merchandise to

432
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:53,940
commercial paper view. Um, everything,
I mean, everything, the, the,

433
00:25:53,941 --> 00:25:58,270
the numbers that are rolling in
are astronomical. Holly Holm has,

434
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,380
when we just took off, we took off
at 1230 in the afternoon. On Sunday.

435
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,310
No, on Monday, right?
It's Monday and yeah,

436
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,340
we just took off at 1230 in the afternoon
on Monday in Australia and Holly Holm

437
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:15,080
was still trending worldwide, number
one. And the NFL is going on right now.

438
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:19,510
And there were crazy games like
green bay lost, uh, again, the, the,

439
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,230
the Patriots barely beat, uh,
barely beat the giants with us.

440
00:26:24,231 --> 00:26:28,040
Last second field goal with six seconds
left and Brady drove down the field with

441
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:28,311
a minute.

442
00:26:28,311 --> 00:26:32,180
Let Holly Holm is still number one
trending worldwide will because it's so

443
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:33,160
stunning because he,

444
00:26:33,161 --> 00:26:37,230
you've seen football a million times
when the ball goes across the line. Yeah.

445
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,150
But he gets crazy.
But to see someone like Rhonda Rousey,

446
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,250
a movie star, you know, the transcending

447
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:49,250
the world of mixed martial
arts get fucking head kicked
like that flat lined and

448
00:26:49,711 --> 00:26:53,340
blood and the hammer fists like Whoa.

449
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,900
Just so stunning.

450
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,830
And when I think about Lady
Gaga and Donald Trump won,

451
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,510
the first thing that I was thinking when,

452
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:04,950
when we're talking about this was you and
I had been friends for a long time and

453
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:10,310
one of the first UFC that I came to
when we became friends was right after

454
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:15,300
September 11th in 2001 when Tito Ortiz
fought Vladimir Matt Yushchenko and you

455
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:18,890
guys went over the paper
view. So the, the what,

456
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:23,460
what happened was there was a cutoff of
three hour cutoff and when the cutoff

457
00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:26,460
hit, the fight was still going
on. It had timed it wrong.

458
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,860
So then you guys had to
give a fuck load of money.

459
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:30,560
I wasn't even working for you back then.
Right.

460
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,300
I was just your friend
and we were hanging out.

461
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,840
We were drinking and that you
and Lorenzo and frank like Whoa,

462
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,190
he lost millions, millions who just like,
everybody was like, I was a bad one to,

463
00:27:41,191 --> 00:27:45,100
everybody was like,
oh fuck at palms over the base who window.

464
00:27:45,101 --> 00:27:48,870
So the paper view shut off with
two rounds left to the flight.

465
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,630
And uh,
so people,

466
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,590
people want their money back
and it was not that many paper.

467
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,580
If you buys back then, man, it was,

468
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:00,090
it was so fringe and I had to,

469
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:04,440
I felt a responsibility as
a fan to try to support it.

470
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:06,180
But there was no social media back then.

471
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:10,590
It was nothing you could do to support
it. I mean, there was nothing I could do.

472
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:12,960
I did. I talk about it in
the interviews, you know,

473
00:28:12,961 --> 00:28:15,780
I go and do the Howard stern show
a talk about it. But that was,

474
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:20,130
they would put them on these fear factor
tours where he'd do these radio tours

475
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,410
and talk about UFC instead
of your backpack. I mean,

476
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,270
nobody even knew what it was and it
was like, it was so fringe back then.

477
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,580
But to go from that to,

478
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:34,350
here we are in 2015 and a fucking
guy who's running for president,

479
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:39,710
Donald Trump is tweeting about the
results of the fight in a catty way.

480
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,260
And I'm like, I'm glad she's
not a good person. He is.

481
00:28:43,261 --> 00:28:45,270
He running is basically a front runner.
Right?

482
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:49,170
Well I think Ben Carson is for the
Republican Party bike guy doesn't have a

483
00:28:49,171 --> 00:28:54,150
chance. He's a sleeper. I can't even
keep his eyes open when he's talking.

484
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:59,020
It's unbelievable. Well, I
don't know who has a chair.

485
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:03,480
I think they're both Jeb Bush is
probably the more likely candidate.

486
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:05,250
It's like wait for the dust to settle.

487
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:09,750
But just the fact that a guy running for
president is addressing mixed martial

488
00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:11,760
arts, which, you know, we, we've, we,

489
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,940
you and I both talked about that
when we first got involved in it,

490
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,190
it was like talking about
being involved in porn.

491
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:22,360
True. Yes. It's, it's
crazy. And, and, uh, again,

492
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,150
just last night was
massive man last night.

493
00:29:25,151 --> 00:29:29,020
It was massive when you
talk about it and all those,

494
00:29:29,021 --> 00:29:32,440
all the people that were tweeting
about the fight before the fight,

495
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,260
Rhonda brings in this crowd of people
that don't normally watch you, I'm saying.

496
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:42,250
Yeah, sure. Definitely.
Well, John Wayne Parr,

497
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:45,430
who is a 10 time world Moitai champion,
he's a good buddy of mine.

498
00:29:45,431 --> 00:29:47,260
He was at the fight yesterday.
He brought his daughter,

499
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,440
his daughter's a huge Ronda Rousey fan
and his daughter was so conflicted after

500
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:57,590
that fight was over because she's a
kickboxer herself. She loved kickboxing.

501
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,210
So on one hand, while
percent, yeah, she's 12,

502
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:06,100
she's 12 she's, she fights, she fights,
she fights, she's good. And last night,

503
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,503
great kid

504
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,050
felt bad because I was actually sitting
right next to her and she got bon on.

505
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:14,320
Come on, Rhonda. Let's go Rhonda.
And you know me, I want her to,

506
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,430
I'm not going to lie. I wanted to see
history get made. I like Ronda Rousey.

507
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,940
I like villains. I liked
the bad guys. I like an ego.

508
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,000
I want her to see history get made.
I was that close.

509
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:28,780
And I also know that it's good for Rhonda
and it's good for the UFC if Rhonda

510
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:30,190
finally has some competition.

511
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:34,030
And so I was cheering every
time Holly Atlanta to punch.

512
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:36,850
And when Holly landed that takedown,
I launched out of my seat.

513
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:41,470
I couldn't help myself and I felt sort
of bad cause she got con Rhonda Come on

514
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,131
Rhonda.
But me,

515
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:46,180
I selfishly just wanted to watch history
get made and I couldn't believe it when

516
00:30:46,181 --> 00:30:48,190
it happened,
but I think it was great for her.

517
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:52,300
This 12 year old girl who loves
fighting to get the seed that you can do

518
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:54,880
anything, you can accomplish
anything with hard work.

519
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:59,140
And we got to hang out with the
guy that trained Holly before this.

520
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,810
And he said that Greg Jackson.
Yes.

521
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:05,370
Greg said that she trained so
hard every day that you know,

522
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,960
she was almost in tears every day,
training hard.

523
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,890
And that makes me so happy
because it just proves,

524
00:31:11,891 --> 00:31:13,990
it sounds like hacky and redundant,

525
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:18,760
but hard work really pays off
in the sweat and the tears.

526
00:31:18,761 --> 00:31:20,980
That's what it takes to
get good at anything.

527
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,470
So zero and then such a good point.

528
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:27,850
And one of the things Holly said that
was cool at the press conference last

529
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,300
night, she said, they
said, one of the guys that,

530
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,730
did you ever doubt that you could do
this? She goes, yeah, I doubted. She goes,

531
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,370
there were days at the
gym when I had a bad day,

532
00:31:36,371 --> 00:31:39,580
and I just walk out and go in
my car and cry for 1520 minutes,

533
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,690
take an I can't do this. You know what I
mean? I, I look terrible in there today.

534
00:31:43,691 --> 00:31:47,410
If this is the way I'm going to
fight, I'm not going to win. She goes,

535
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,453
then I'd go home,

536
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:52,840
I'd eat and relax and I go back at six
and work on everything that I wasn't good

537
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:56,590
at two hours earlier until I got it right.
You know,

538
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,250
and that goes with exactly what you're
saying is you can tell physically when

539
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,650
she went to the art dot,
she was shredded.

540
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,560
She had a six pack and I've
never seen her hand before.

541
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:09,730
I mean she looked in incredible
shape and she was also so poised,

542
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,660
even though obviously she was under a
tremendous amount of pressure and the

543
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:15,970
enormity of the moment wasn't,
it didn't escape her,

544
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,390
but she was bouncing around
and she would pace and bouts,

545
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,630
pace and bouncing pace and bounce.

546
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,360
I was watching her during Ron doesn't
entire insurance, which is, you know,

547
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:28,960
sitting that close to something that
you don't really get to see on TV.

548
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,950
That I had my camera,
my eyes focus directly on holiday,

549
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,760
on holiday the entire time Rhonda
was coming out and she was,

550
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:39,980
she was doing five steps,
bounce, go the other way, five

551
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,610
steps bounced when she was getting,
uh,

552
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,940
her mouthpiece put in when Rhonda
was stepping in. The octagon.

553
00:32:46,941 --> 00:32:49,620
Holly was nothing but focus,

554
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,170
100% no distractions.
It was amazing to see

555
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:58,990
was a different kind of a focus because
it was a girl who's experienced that

556
00:32:58,991 --> 00:33:03,430
kind of intense pressers
pressure situation before
that world title pressure.

557
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,880
Like when Batchko Hay was in
Brazil and she was facing Rhonda,

558
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,250
she had this look on her
face before that fight,

559
00:33:09,251 --> 00:33:12,460
like she was about to go fight a
werewolf with a butter knife. You know?

560
00:33:12,461 --> 00:33:15,010
She was just like, oh, I'll
put on a brave face. She,

561
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,290
she almost knew she was
going to get fucked up.

562
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:20,050
It was almost like the enormity
of the moment was just like, Ooh,

563
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,170
like you can't breathe. Like you
ever take a shower, a cold shower,

564
00:33:23,171 --> 00:33:27,640
and you can't get, you can't breathe.
You just, that's how it looked like.

565
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:31,330
She was just overwhelmed.
That wasn't the case with holiday.

566
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,680
It wasn't the case at all. She was, she
was. She knew it was intense pressure.

567
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,840
She knew it was a big moment,
but she was prepared

568
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,950
for it.

569
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,920
She's back again.
How great should we do it now?

570
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:48,540
Oh yeah. All right. We'll do
this and we'll come back to
this. What are we at here?

571
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,120
We're at 33 minutes. All right.
Listen, Ladies and gentlemen,
I know you're like, oh,

572
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,860
it's only three, three minutes. How
could that be the whole podcast?

573
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,410
We're gonna eat.
We're going to have a little Vino.

574
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,690
Got a little Sharise and we'll be back.

575
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,710
Maybe I'll even grab Greg Jackson from
the cheap seats. Bring him up here.

576
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,773
See it a bit,

577
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:12,540
and we're back around to ladies and
gentlemen. I was just sitting there.

578
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,720
I was watching Birdman.
God Damn,

579
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:18,060
it's a good movie.
I got to stop listening to Howard Stern.

580
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,580
He was saying it was boring. The
fucking movie's Great. It's really good.

581
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,660
It's really good.
It's really good.

582
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,220
Howard was just jealous that somebody
successful at the bigger news than,

583
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:34,610
Oh, I get it. The bird. Is that what
you're saying? Okay, here we go. Ah,

584
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,070
we were just talking about whether
or not people get pissed at the,

585
00:34:37,071 --> 00:34:41,190
the length of the podcast. Um, they don't,
I mean, they do, but they don't, you know,

586
00:34:41,191 --> 00:34:45,750
it's like some people do, but
that's the UFC, right? I mean,

587
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,100
some people get pissed at everything.
It's like that about it. We have wheat,

588
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:53,790
wheat. I think we're unique in this
era and if you're putting out content,

589
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:56,760
if you putting out a,
anything you do in that,

590
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:00,390
there's too many people that have
opinions. Everybody can talk to you.

591
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:05,640
So it's hard to sample and get like an
accurate assessment of what's going on.

592
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,580
It's hard for me to live in a world now
where everybody gets to have an opinion.

593
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:14,160
How many times have you guys
had to deal with people? Say,

594
00:35:14,161 --> 00:35:19,080
oh he's fucking cords or water down.
I'm tired of this fucking bullshit.

595
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:24,280
How's this guy's still floating?
What is, you have to, you know,

596
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,720
especially in this,
in this new world we're living,

597
00:35:27,721 --> 00:35:29,490
you have to be able to tune that shit out,
man.

598
00:35:29,491 --> 00:35:32,200
If I listen to the shit that you know,

599
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:36,330
the media or on or some of the
Weirdos on social media said,

600
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:37,950
this will be all fucked up.

601
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,600
Do you still fuck with
people on social media?

602
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,790
Cause you used to go back and
forth and get angry at people?

603
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:45,210
I don't get angry when
I'm on social media.

604
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,710
If I'm on there and I'm talking to people,
trust me. It's like I'm having fun.

605
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:52,960
I'm not angry.
I have time to kill me.

606
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,340
And me and a guy called fat boy,
you got into it today.

607
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:03,150
It's fat to wait for the morning
cause Nate, you call that boy. I said,

608
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:05,760
stick to what it looks like
you're good at eating. Um,

609
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,090
let me let me analyst.
But as one with him, uh,

610
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,090
he was saying that now that
women are fighting in the UFC,

611
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:16,320
I must be really desperate.

612
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,010
Like we're going out of business
and I must be really desperate.

613
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:25,090
What's funny is these people and
on social media, he says, uh,

614
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:30,360
he says to me, you know, he
obviously ripping on the UFC.

615
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,950
So I hit him back and I say,
where have you been living under a rock?

616
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,530
You know,
you don't know who Ronda Rousey is a,

617
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:42,390
you didn't know there was a Rhonda
Rousey, Holly Holm Fight. And uh, he says,

618
00:36:42,391 --> 00:36:45,090
yeah, apparently a lot of people
live under a rock. Nobody,

619
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:49,800
nobody watches the UFC anymore.
Nobody would, you know,
something like that. I said,

620
00:36:49,801 --> 00:36:50,070
listen,

621
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:54,180
why don't you stick to what it looks
like you're good at eating and then leave

622
00:36:54,181 --> 00:36:57,420
the fighting of the day. He comes back
and says, I live in the same town.

623
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:01,140
You seem real tough over Twitter. Why
don't you come see that? Yes, exactly.

624
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:05,970
Flutter on the size on,
I'm easy to find fat boy.

625
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,880
Come find me. You know, just
like, but I have fun with it.

626
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:13,380
I'm not serious and I'm
not, you know, listen,

627
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:17,160
if you say stupid shit and I got some
time, I'll play. I'll go with you. I'll,

628
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,630
I'll do it.
It's fun for me.

629
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:23,870
I'm actually actually called Joel
recently and asked Joe what he thought of

630
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:29,070
rose.
Do you like rose and Joe

631
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:35,490
also very opinionated. Head does
not like rose at all and doesn't,

632
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,600
uh, like the type of comedy, I guess.

633
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,570
You know the type of people that would
row somebody that the front, yeah,

634
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:47,710
I like to watch it, but I don't like to
do artistic, this is mine. My personality.

635
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,470
Yeah. I'm, I have, I'm very extreme.

636
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:55,300
Either I go to war with you
or I'll go to war for you.

637
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,730
Either I love you or hate you.
I'm not, I'm not ambivalent.
So like if I loved you,

638
00:38:00,731 --> 00:38:03,280
I don't want to mock you.
Ride this motherfucker.

639
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,740
This is the number one writer
for roasts in the country.

640
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:09,150
He didn't even know he
writes. He, he's one of the,

641
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,740
like the main writers for
all the comedy Central Roast.

642
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,970
If you hear like a good singer,
I'm not a comedy central roast.

643
00:38:14,971 --> 00:38:18,550
It's absolutely brutal.
Most likely Tony Hinchcliffe wrote it,

644
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,880
but he's got that sense of humor.
My sense of humor is not Mike that I,

645
00:38:22,881 --> 00:38:26,920
I feel bad if I make fun of somebody I
care about and if I don't care about you,

646
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,020
I don't want to be on a show with you.
You know,

647
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:32,740
if there was something like roasting Tony,
if I had a rose Tony on some think,

648
00:38:32,741 --> 00:38:37,690
what does this ma'am, no thank
you. Your birthday. Don't mind.

649
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:42,550
90 gif coaches has their time.
Oh yeah, I don't eat that.

650
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:45,560
That's how I keep my girl is figure.
I'm trying to honey,

651
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:52,070
what does that lollies lollies. What is a
lolly? That's not a lolly. What is that?

652
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:56,170
It's a raspberry lonely a lot, but
it's, these are like gum drops. Yeah.

653
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,350
I'll let you put in Australia.
Oh, you call them lollies? Oh,

654
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,450
we call lollipops like it as a stick.
Yeah.

655
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:07,660
You said it was Molly tried to
get sex cause Exposito birthday.

656
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:11,380
Quantis look, you've got
16 hours. Don't be a pussy.

657
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:15,970
No. What can I have a cup of
coffee though, please? Just black.

658
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:23,020
Um, where were we? Roast a ballbuster.
Yeah, and Baltimore and guys,

659
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,550
not bustle bells is good but,
but if I wanted to go like he goes,

660
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,960
like Tony goes deep.

661
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:34,060
He writes so stealing shit like he does,

662
00:39:34,061 --> 00:39:36,280
he writes the best jokes for rose.
He's just got this,

663
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:40,330
he's got everybody's personalities. Like
we were talking about this last night.

664
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:43,180
Like he's like a guy,
like he doesn't do this on stage,

665
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,920
but we're joking around and he,

666
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,730
he'll say puns like
ridiculous play on word puns.

667
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,470
My brain doesn't work like that.

668
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:53,580
And you know, there's different
comedic muscles. There's like cons,

669
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:57,900
there's roasting, there's staying
in the pocket, doing long bits.

670
00:39:57,901 --> 00:40:00,660
Like when you do, you know, you'll talk
about the same topic for 10 minutes.

671
00:40:00,661 --> 00:40:04,440
There's like different muscles, you know,
like I don't move around a lot on stage,

672
00:40:04,441 --> 00:40:06,480
which it is something that
I sort of wish I could do.

673
00:40:06,481 --> 00:40:08,880
I can't do impressions like
you can either, you know,

674
00:40:08,881 --> 00:40:12,810
there's just different muscles and
stuff. It's sorta like, you know,

675
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,420
to use an analogy,
it's sort of like UFC fighters.

676
00:40:15,421 --> 00:40:19,050
Like some people are good at some things
and sometimes the audience once those

677
00:40:19,051 --> 00:40:23,070
certain things and uh, you got to know
which muscle to use against your opponent.

678
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,470
If your opponents, that
audience, that venue,

679
00:40:25,471 --> 00:40:28,520
whether it's in Australia or Sweden or la,
you know?

680
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:32,780
Yeah. Just when it comes to like the
roasting thing, I enjoy watching it.

681
00:40:32,781 --> 00:40:36,350
Like I go to cause a thing called roast
battle, but they do at the comedy store,

682
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,180
it's fucking hilarious.

683
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:41,690
They have to comics and
they'll go back and forth.

684
00:40:41,691 --> 00:40:45,230
Like one person will tell a joke and the
other person will tell a joke and it's

685
00:40:45,231 --> 00:40:49,130
fucking brutal. A rap battle for
comedy. Exactly. That's great. Cool.

686
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,460
These motherfuckers,
they steal years from each of those lives.

687
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,970
Like we've seen some who were like,
oh my God,

688
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:00,200
we have to sit back and hold your head
and you just feel the pain to the other

689
00:41:00,201 --> 00:41:03,140
person.
I can't do that where I can't do that.

690
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,670
We're thinking about doing a
roast on fight pass, you know,

691
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:10,880
roasting different people.
Yeah. Oh that's your guy.

692
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,133
That's your guy.

693
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:15,840
I mean I've been literally not with his
second of hesitation if you said, yeah,

694
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,590
I need one guy to roast people.

695
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:22,220
I'd say Tony Hinchcliffe
wait before you'd say rose,

696
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:26,370
he ba 20 inch left before you even get
the word people out. I would say so

697
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,730
Tony is a huge crossover in there
because obviously you know, people,

698
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,750
you know the UFC in the
roasting is very close,

699
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:37,310
closely related in the way that if you
like watching people get slammed in real

700
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:39,950
life, you know, you'll love
to see them get verbally slam.

701
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,080
It all started cause I'm from Youngstown,
Ohio,

702
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:46,400
a tough neighborhood and I sorta defending
the little guy so I defended myself

703
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:50,000
with my words. So it's all sort of
in the same ballpark, you know? Yeah.

704
00:41:50,001 --> 00:41:53,100
I'd love to help you out with
the UFC rose. That's easy. You,

705
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:57,150
he's your guy and Adam Hunter's good
attention. Yeah, I knew Adam with,

706
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,110
he's great with MMA to him because
he knows so much about MMA. You know,

707
00:42:01,111 --> 00:42:04,310
he's very, very knowledgeable.
Yup. No, I talked to Adam off.

708
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,260
So you've got to do
something on fight pass.

709
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:11,220
We're talking about it with fighters.
Tony's a perfect guy to, cause they won't,

710
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:15,960
it will feel like they need
to beat his ass. I Dunno.

711
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:20,520
I Dunno how many fighters could
actually be roasted. I think that a lot.

712
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,400
Can I not do it? I can't tell
you how many guys get mad at me.

713
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:28,750
I point out like situations that
they're not necessarily the best dad or,

714
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,210
or skills that they may need to like
look into. Like they get mad at me.

715
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:38,050
So it was just an idea. It might not
even work, but I don't know how many,

716
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,480
how many fighters would
actually want to be roasted.

717
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:45,050
I think a lot of them have a great
sense of humor, I think. Yeah.

718
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:49,840
I think you'd be pretty surprised. I
think if they're from a different country,

719
00:42:49,841 --> 00:42:53,500
like resilience, probably wouldn't
want to get made fun of that much.

720
00:42:53,501 --> 00:42:56,650
Just thrown it out there like did.
I think it all depends on the culture,

721
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,390
but a lot of, uh, a lot of
Americans are into it. You know,

722
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:04,540
like I know that Brendan Shop, he's
like, it'd be great with things.

723
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:06,030
So many of those guys that I met.

724
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:10,910
What you need to do before you, uh, have
Cyborg, have our first fight in the UFC,

725
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:16,000
have Tony Roaster,
let's each still haunts me.

726
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,900
Still wants to be a part of the big show.

727
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:23,070
Yeah, that'd be amazing. I
don't even know where I'd begin.

728
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:26,130
Where would I start properly?

729
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,310
She's the only person that cuts the
weight by chopping off her deck.

730
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:36,290
Yeah, there'd be a, there'd be a lot of
different angles and you'd approach that.

731
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,210
I think it would be tough
for a fighter to do a,

732
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:42,800
Roche was sold back to the
Ronda Rousey Holly Holm thing.

733
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:47,480
Obviously you can't talk to Rhonda
right now because it's too, too soon.

734
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:52,220
It's too intense emotions.
She's probably just in agony right now,

735
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,473
but,
um,

736
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,860
how long do you wait before you
think about scheduling a rematch?

737
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,230
Yeah.
Well normally when fighters come off,

738
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:03,930
we'll fight like the Rhonda fight,

739
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:09,630
the Lawlor I'm Mcdonald's
fight. Uh, you know, you don't,

740
00:44:09,631 --> 00:44:13,030
you don't even talk to them
about fighting for, uh,

741
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,390
the last core me a fight
with, uh, with uh, yeah,

742
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,950
it just, you just wait and, uh,

743
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:27,690
probably a month, about a month he
call and say, Hey, what's going on?

744
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:29,560
Really thinking how you feel
and you know, yup. You have

745
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,010
lunch with her and you
going to like talk car on

746
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,100
the phone or do you want to
do an in person? Rhonda? Yeah.

747
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:36,740
Yeah. You know, after this thing,

748
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:41,480
when Holly is going to be in a
fucking whirlwind, when she gets back,

749
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:46,010
she's going to be, you know, normally
she'd probably just get home.

750
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:50,450
We'd take some time off hanging
out with a, she's going to be on

751
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:56,390
radio tours, television. She's
going to have a lot of work to do.

752
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,260
Rhonda will be able to go home and
just chill out, relax for a while,

753
00:45:00,261 --> 00:45:05,000
got her head together. He'll level
a little bit. Um, and then, um,

754
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:10,570
you know, I'll see her next
week in person and then, uh,

755
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:12,710
what I'm talking about fighting,

756
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,120
he won't talk about fighting next week.

757
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:18,900
You don't think she'll want to talk about
it immediately? No, no. If she does,

758
00:45:18,901 --> 00:45:21,510
that's cool. She wants
to talk. We can talk,

759
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:25,710
but I won't talk to her about it and give
her a month. What will you talk about?

760
00:45:25,711 --> 00:45:28,230
We say Divia how about the weather?

761
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:29,143
Just hang out,

762
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,910
have lunch with her and hang out with
her and see how she's feeling. So yeah,

763
00:45:31,911 --> 00:45:36,210
she's doing, you know, um, yeah,

764
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,590
job is very weird, man,
because your job is,

765
00:45:39,591 --> 00:45:41,990
you're not just a promoter
and a lot of ways,

766
00:45:41,991 --> 00:45:46,280
like you have to be almost like a
counselor or like a psychologist in a way.

767
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:51,550
Deal with so many different egos
and personalities and quirky,

768
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:57,770
you know, that without a
doubt. Personal problems,

769
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:02,300
business problems, you
know, a lot of stuff.

770
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:03,660
We deal with a lot of stuff with the fire.

771
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,000
Well,
you do probably wouldn't go back to that.

772
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:08,850
When we were talking about
earlier that 2001 Vladimir, Matt,

773
00:46:08,851 --> 00:46:13,080
you Shango Tito Ortiz fight like that
was when you guys were first started.

774
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:18,780
Did you ever imagine that you
would have this kind of role now?

775
00:46:18,781 --> 00:46:21,600
Like what did you see the
role of a promoter being?

776
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:23,610
Because you're not just a promoter,
you're,

777
00:46:23,611 --> 00:46:26,640
you're a promoter and a very
weird way cause you're a promoter,

778
00:46:26,641 --> 00:46:30,450
but you're also like the main
personality behind the UFC.

779
00:46:30,451 --> 00:46:33,510
Like you mean like when I checked into
the hotel yesterday called me Mr. White.

780
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:36,900
I'm like we're both bald but I'm not Mr.
White. Like you know what I'm saying?

781
00:46:36,901 --> 00:46:40,580
Like if they say, oh this fight looking
guys coming in here, it must be Mr. White.

782
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:44,220
I see shit on social media where it says
you and I are turning into each other,

783
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,000
which is fucking photo.
That's true.

784
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:52,180
Yeah. You know what? When you
think of the term promoter,

785
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:57,360
most promoters are fucking now
secretary to fax machine. Right?

786
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,430
Seriously there, there's no
infrastructure there. There's no,

787
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:04,480
we're so different because not only
do we have 500 fighters under contract

788
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:10,960
at 300 and something employees
to employees, um, you know,

789
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:16,980
in a weird way, we're more like a media
company yet we promote fights. It's,

790
00:47:16,981 --> 00:47:20,620
it's, it's, it's really morphed
into this weird thing. But you know,

791
00:47:20,621 --> 00:47:24,840
a lot of this stuff, a lot of
the things is in the, in these,

792
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,980
in the growing pains of
building this business,

793
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:31,300
the relationships that you have have
with, with, with a lot of these guys.

794
00:47:31,301 --> 00:47:35,560
You know,
there's some guys on the undercard said,

795
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:38,620
I've never even met before.
And then there's people that I'm really,

796
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:43,250
really close to. And, uh, and you
were saying it earlier, you know, you,

797
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:48,750
you learn to care about these people.
Um,

798
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:52,180
no people that are involved in
their lives and you become clubs.

799
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:55,140
Yeah. And you see them lose. Yeah.

800
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,930
And you know, and then there's,
there's so many times that,

801
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:01,613
you know,

802
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:05,220
two people go in and care about both
of them and somebody is going to win or

803
00:48:05,221 --> 00:48:08,640
lose that night. You know, there are some
fights that I don't even want to watch.

804
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:11,640
You know, it's like shit, I don't
even want to watch this fight.

805
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:15,060
It's going to be one of these good
people are going to have to lose.

806
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,230
Yeah. And there's no way around
it. There's no way around.

807
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,810
And then there's times when I'm like
it out. It's the complete opposite to,

808
00:48:21,811 --> 00:48:25,560
I mean, let's be honest, where I don't
have a great relationship with a guy,

809
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:30,480
you know, you know, there's a
parallel between you and me too.

810
00:48:30,481 --> 00:48:35,481
And that there really wasn't a you before
you and there really wasn't that many

811
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:40,230
people doing commentary before me.
Like you don't,

812
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:45,100
you don't like a a normal promoter
in a sense that they think is by,

813
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:49,440
I mean you have, dawn came, it was like
only in America, but it's all, you know,

814
00:48:49,441 --> 00:48:51,870
it's mostly showmanship and bullshit and,

815
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:57,530
and you just somehow another figured
out how to just be Dana White.

816
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,200
You know,
you've,

817
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,200
how do you do a member like some sort of
a conscious decision to not put on some

818
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,900
sort of fake professional attitude?
Or is that just not in you at all?

819
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:14,780
You know, you're, you're
you, you're the Ui new.

820
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,460
Like before you were famous.
See at the same dude,

821
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:22,320
thanks man. What we, what
we, I don't know man.

822
00:49:22,321 --> 00:49:24,150
I don't know really how to explain it,
but

823
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:30,950
I just go in there and we put on
fights and we, you know, we've,

824
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:32,850
we've tried to put it on the best fights

825
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,460
that are available with, with the best
talent that we have for, for instance,

826
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:42,150
I believed that the Ronda Rousey,
Holly Holm fight was the fight.

827
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:47,040
But you get all these fucking
conspiracy Weirdos that, that,

828
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:50,010
that start talking about. All
anybody wants to say is, oh,

829
00:49:50,011 --> 00:49:52,860
I want to see Dana White's
face after Holly Holm beat her.

830
00:49:52,861 --> 00:49:56,250
And I want to see what he,
two women are going in there.

831
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,320
Rhonda and Holly are going in there.

832
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,680
Somebody's going to win and
somebody's going to lose. I mean,

833
00:50:01,681 --> 00:50:06,030
anybody that's stupid enough to
fucking think that. I think, you know,

834
00:50:06,031 --> 00:50:10,560
somebody could win forever or somebody
else couldn't win is ridiculous.

835
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:15,100
Or that Rhonda hasn't fought the best
competition available on his phone.

836
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,670
All the best girls in the world.
That 135 pounds.

837
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,910
We brought Holly Hollman.
Yeah,

838
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,310
it's just that made the wait time.

839
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:27,980
The wait Cyborg has had opportunity for

840
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,470
this fight.
All she has had to do was make the weight.

841
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:35,030
She hasn't tried it would that much
money on the line and all the things that

842
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,680
are going on.
Look at last night's event,

843
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:41,390
Holly Holm stepped up and
took the opportunity and won.

844
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:44,000
She won the fucking fight.

845
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:48,440
The opportunity was there for the
opportunity has been there for Cyborg this

846
00:50:48,441 --> 00:50:50,660
whole time. Guaranteed. Oh,

847
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:54,440
get out there and said all that crazy
shit that they said and she die if she

848
00:50:54,441 --> 00:50:56,430
made weight and all that
stuff that was going on.

849
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:57,830
What was Ronda supposed to go to?

850
00:50:57,831 --> 00:51:02,600
One 45 or fight her to catch weight for
what Ron does. The 135 pound champion.

851
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:06,350
Like it or not, that's, that's her weight
division and that's where she fights.

852
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,820
There's plenty of women there. And I
felt like going into this next fight,

853
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:16,360
I saw the Misha Tate fight twice, saw that
fight, none of that finance, you know,

854
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:20,990
and, and yes, we did. We did set
that fight up as a contender fight,

855
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:25,460
you know what I mean? But I felt
like that wasn't the best fight.

856
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:27,020
That wasn't the best fight.

857
00:51:27,021 --> 00:51:29,720
I felt we brought Holly Holm
and to fight Ronda Rousey.

858
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:32,000
And I felt like that was
the best fight to put on.

859
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,030
We're literally in a fucking meeting room.

860
00:51:35,031 --> 00:51:37,220
We sit in this board room
all day and I'm like,

861
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,080
we got to make this Holly Holm fight,
man.

862
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,020
This is the fight you're going to
ask Lorenzo's. Exactly. Actually,

863
00:51:42,021 --> 00:51:44,300
the way it went down.
This is the fucking girl.

864
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:48,710
This is the next big challenge for Ronda.
This girl is fucking tall.

865
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:52,670
She's got the heightened read advantage.
She fucking kicks. Uh, you know,

866
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:55,790
she stays on the outside.
Ron has never faced anybody like that.

867
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:57,320
This is the fight that make it,

868
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:01,770
not to mention the fact that she's
undefeated and she's got legit boxing

869
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,090
credentials. This is the
fight. And we did it.

870
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:09,950
Yeah. I mean, we're right now, it's
kind of funny because we're in a plane,

871
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,670
we're flying over the ocean,
and when we land,

872
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,530
it's the buzz just as kind of started,
I made it exploded,

873
00:52:18,531 --> 00:52:20,060
but it's almost like a tidal wave.

874
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:24,740
And that tidal wave is just going to
reach all across social media and all

875
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:28,830
across television shows and radio shows.
And you know,

876
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:31,130
by the time we land,
it's going to be Monday morning,

877
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:34,400
all the morning radio shows are
going to be talking about this.

878
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,500
All the television shows are
going to be talking about this.

879
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:38,660
That's when the party really begins.

880
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:43,700
And that's when the Holly Holm coming out
party really begins. True. And you know,

881
00:52:43,701 --> 00:52:47,600
we're, we're right now, we're kind of
like sitting here while the fuse is lit.

882
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:51,960
I've been doing this for 15 years,
man. And let me tell you what,

883
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,560
anybody can beat anybody on any given day.
You know,

884
00:52:56,010 --> 00:53:00,480
even even reporters and fans and even
you win this fight was first announced

885
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:04,290
Kevin Alley. He's like, I'm not flying
over there for a 15 second fight.

886
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,750
I think we'll be over in 15 seconds.
And you never, Freddie Roach

887
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:09,890
said in a lot of people said,

888
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:11,930
well I didn't think that Holly
was going to get destroyed,

889
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:15,500
but I thought that Amanda Nunez was
a more dangerous fight based on her

890
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:19,310
performance against Sarah McMahon cause
she smashed her man, knocked her down,

891
00:53:19,311 --> 00:53:22,460
beat her up and I know she had beaten
up cats in Ghana and the first round,

892
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,920
although she got stopped later in the
route, I think cats, Donald stills

893
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:30,510
dangerous as fuck. She just made a
big rookie mistake. She's charged,

894
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:35,780
got caught in a scramble and you know
Rhonda is so nasty at catching those arm

895
00:53:35,971 --> 00:53:40,020
bars and even in this fight she had been
tagged with all those fucking straight

896
00:53:40,021 --> 00:53:43,080
lefts.
She had been rocked and she's still,

897
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:46,620
when they went to the ground she was a
immediately threatening with an arm bar.

898
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:49,160
She still has the best arm bar technique.
And Emma.

899
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:53,940
There was one part for a second where
she caught her on standby and grabbed it

900
00:53:53,941 --> 00:53:57,690
like a crocodile and just, I don't
know what she was going to do with it,

901
00:53:57,691 --> 00:54:01,640
but she fucking added trying
to take her down, had it.

902
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:05,850
She got Holly just kept fighting.

903
00:54:05,851 --> 00:54:08,620
She got defensive and she just
kind of rolling out of it.

904
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,630
I think this is a,

905
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:15,510
this is a pivotal time for Rhonda
because she's a huge superstar.

906
00:54:15,511 --> 00:54:17,970
She's a huge movie star.
She's a huge celebrity.

907
00:54:17,971 --> 00:54:22,971
But what got her to that position as being
a great fighter and there's a balance

908
00:54:25,831 --> 00:54:28,890
there somewhere and you've got
to find out where's the balance,

909
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:33,400
is the balance spending all this time
working on movies and all this other shit

910
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:38,280
and, or is the balance going
back to fucking rocky for
going to that cabin in the

911
00:54:38,281 --> 00:54:41,280
woods and going, running up the
hills, the snow and you know,

912
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:43,770
and focusing on just fighting.

913
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:48,450
And that might be what she needs
to do now. I mean if she or,

914
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:51,510
or that's it, you know,
or figure out what it is.

915
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:55,630
I mean she's got enough money now and
assume she probably, if she's frugal,

916
00:54:55,631 --> 00:54:58,600
it doesn't have to work again for the
rest of her life. She does. She doesn't.

917
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:02,730
Right?
So she has to decide what she wants to do.

918
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:06,030
Does she want to figure
out what rent wrong,

919
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:10,080
figure out what she could have done
better. Get back to the drawing board,

920
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,230
maybe work with some new coaches that
are going to work with her on kicks and

921
00:55:13,231 --> 00:55:17,400
distancing and flip work or maybe figure
out some other ways to try to get Holly

922
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:20,830
down. Other than the collar
tie and and clenching. I mean,

923
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:25,640
she's the mentally strongest fucking
athlete I've ever met in my life when she

924
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:30,020
gets over this, this loss she's going
to, she's going to be a savage man.

925
00:55:30,021 --> 00:55:30,854
I mean she was,

926
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,190
she was a maniac in a hard worker
when she was the best in the world.

927
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:36,410
What's she going to be
like now that she lost?

928
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,940
And the thing that makes this
fight great again is Holly Holm.

929
00:55:40,941 --> 00:55:45,941
Now everybody knows how talented Holly
Holm is and that Holly Holm is legit.

930
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:51,530
And Holly Holm is a workhorse to both
of these two are going to take the next

931
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:54,170
few months,
go back in and start working on shit,

932
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:59,210
and they're going to clash again and
there's second fight will be fucking

933
00:55:59,211 --> 00:56:02,620
awesome. Does Rhonda have a broken jaw
because social media was reporting on?

934
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:06,470
That's what, that's bullshit. There's
nothing wrong with Rhonda, Rhonda. Well,

935
00:56:06,471 --> 00:56:09,170
there's definitely something wrong
with it. Well, I mean, she's concussed.

936
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:13,160
She's heard.
He had a huge fucking cotton in her lip.

937
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:17,690
Her lip was split open and uh, I
was, I was there and I was like,

938
00:56:17,691 --> 00:56:21,320
you know what? We don't want a
doctor. Someone that fucking lip.

939
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:22,890
What's lip going gonna look like at the,

940
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:27,550
so we brought in like the best plastic
surgeon and from Australia last night.

941
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:32,320
He came in late last night. Soder lip
over and her lip looks awesome today.

942
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:35,810
They do. When they do that,
did they do interior stitches?

943
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:40,860
So they do it from the inside out and
plastic surgeons are just so much better

944
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,810
than dockers. I'll give you an example.
In here. Something fucking crazy.

945
00:56:43,811 --> 00:56:48,730
So at the last fight, um, when
we were at the core MBA fight,

946
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:52,720
Courtenay Gustafsson sitting there and
my phone starts fucking ringing during

947
00:56:52,721 --> 00:56:56,890
the fight and, uh, it's my sister in law,

948
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:02,620
so I pick up the phone during the fight
and my wife was on the phone going

949
00:57:02,621 --> 00:57:06,770
fucking crazy. So we have, uh, uh, uh,

950
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:11,970
English massive two year old English
massive who jumped on my daughter and

951
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:16,930
ripped her ear off her head
in my house. How did he do it?

952
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,620
Fucking just jumped at his paw in it.
No teeth.

953
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:25,480
Watts ripped her ear in half
this way and then off the head.

954
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:30,850
So it was hanging by the thing here,
like by the bottom of the ear.

955
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:36,250
So how old's your daughter? My
daughter is nine. Oh my God. Yeah.

956
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:37,330
Nine years old.

957
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:41,500
Fucking dog rips her ear off during
the core me Gustafsson fight.

958
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:46,330
My wife is hysterical. Can't even
understand a word she's saying. So

959
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:50,720
I have to calm her down. What the fuck
is going on? Tell me what's happening.

960
00:57:50,721 --> 00:57:55,160
And she tells me, I said,
okay, I grab doc d. Uh,

961
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:59,680
one of the doctors for the UFC,
he gets on the phone and calls Las Vegas.

962
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,110
The first thing he did is trying
to set up a doctor and I said,

963
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:05,470
I don't want a doctor. I want a plastic
surgeon. Get me a plastic surgeon.

964
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:10,140
He calls them his plastic surgeon.
They go to the hospital. Um,

965
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:15,040
they had to wait like an hour and a half.
So you can imagine the freaking out.

966
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:17,310
They got to wait an hour and a half
because they're waiting for the plastic.

967
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:22,350
But the plastic surgeon came and put her
ear back on and then fix the ear this

968
00:58:22,991 --> 00:58:24,130
way,
sewed it back together.

969
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:29,080
My daughters ear looks
unbelievable because you can't
have a doctor do that kind

970
00:58:29,081 --> 00:58:30,820
of shit because if you
have a doctor do it,

971
00:58:30,821 --> 00:58:34,960
all he cares about is getting the fucking
ear back on. Not How it looks, you know,

972
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:38,410
but you cosmetically, it's like the doctor
will come in and Stitch Rhonda Slip,

973
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:43,000
but did Rhonda, his lip is going to look
weird. So when we do fights in Vegas,

974
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:46,960
there's a, there's a doctor named Dr
Shoe. I Dunno if you've ever met Dr Shoe.

975
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,090
He's a tall Asian guy with glasses.

976
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:54,540
He is the man when it comes to he's so
he sews up these cuts because as you

977
00:58:55,931 --> 00:59:00,190
know, in fighting cuts are a big problem.
They have to be sewn up the right way,

978
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,340
not only cosmetically,
but if you're going to continue to fight,

979
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,550
you have to sell them up so that they
don't rip open all the time and getting a

980
00:59:06,551 --> 00:59:10,510
lot of scar tissue under there and
things like that. So we're very,

981
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:12,040
very careful and stuff like that.

982
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:14,680
But if anything traumatic ever
happens to your kids or your wife,

983
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,660
you're looking for a plastic surgeon,
not a doctor.

984
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:21,680
What the fuck did you do to that? Doug?
Did you kill that dog is gone, Doug Bit.

985
00:59:21,681 --> 00:59:25,700
Your daughter's here. Dog's gone. Yeah.
Ah, to kill that dog myself. I know.

986
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:28,550
It's crazy.
Fuck Great.

987
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:31,950
Massive too.
But he's the sweetest dog in the world.

988
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:34,630
Doug would never do any of that on.
My daughter had a buck,

989
00:59:34,631 --> 00:59:39,040
an ice cream cone and the dog when I was
trying to get the ice cream cone and my

990
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:43,180
daughter said no, and the dog just
freaked out, man. At the end of the day,

991
00:59:43,181 --> 00:59:47,230
even though it's a dog, it's a fucking
wild animal and went and they're just,

992
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:50,200
they're fucking nuts with food
and now when you have food there,

993
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:51,670
you could feed your dog,

994
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,610
feed your dog till he's full and then
you're sitting there eating food and the

995
00:59:54,611 --> 00:59:59,380
dog is like looking, you know, he
wants some more fun. Wow. Look at this.

996
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,920
Hello fellas.
We're doing a podcast right now.

997
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:09,970
You guys circled Gerkin as
hanging out with just one way.

998
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,180
Good luck with that. This plane,
his playing is so bad ass.

999
01:00:16,181 --> 01:00:19,270
Then it has two different levels.
There's 500 people on this plane,

1000
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:24,540
1100 bags and there's actually a lounge
upstairs where people can hang out in

1001
01:00:24,881 --> 01:00:26,950
the lounge. He had, it's
like a little bar area.

1002
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:30,740
He's Quantas flights are fucking
ridiculous. We're not great.

1003
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,780
This is the first podcasts, by the way.
That's never been done in an actual pod.

1004
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:37,670
Yeah,
we're in a pod and the pod that's

1005
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:45,010
it might be right. Yeah. Everybody
else just does it in a room.

1006
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:48,820
I says, well, how did it
become, it's from iPods, right?

1007
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:52,040
I guess that's the
name, right? Yeah. Yeah.

1008
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:55,180
I had to get done branding in everywhere.

1009
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:59,180
Chocolate Dell had that crazy cut in his
lip after the rich Franklin fight and

1010
01:00:59,181 --> 01:01:00,770
now you can't even,
you can't even know that.

1011
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:05,370
Yup. What's even crazier
is Robbie Lawler. Oh yeah.

1012
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,100
We had Robbie Lawler's done
with a plastic surgeon too,

1013
01:01:08,101 --> 01:01:12,540
and actually the Jessica Penne a fight
when she fought. You want to on Jay check.

1014
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:13,613
See her nose.

1015
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:18,030
We flew her straight to la and she went
and saw the best plastic surgeon in La

1016
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:22,920
and we got her nose fixed, so everybody,
next time you see Jessica Penne at,

1017
01:01:22,921 --> 01:01:25,320
you'll notice that her
nose looks phenomenal.

1018
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:29,400
You look at that Gash and what that
looked like. If we sent her to a doctor,

1019
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:31,200
she looked horrible.

1020
01:01:31,201 --> 01:01:35,670
Right now a doctor would have stitched
or stapled that thing together and she

1021
01:01:35,671 --> 01:01:36,370
would look terrible.

1022
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:40,470
They sent her to the best plastic
surgeon in La and she looks phenomenal.

1023
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:43,440
That's amazing. By the way, I
remember her nose after that fight.

1024
01:01:43,441 --> 01:01:45,510
I've seen snow men with better noses.

1025
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,620
You son of a bitch. You had
one ready? He had one ready.

1026
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:55,340
Can you know Kevin Ross is a Muay
Thai fighter from America. Great.

1027
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:59,350
Great fighter fights for a lion
fight. He was uh, talking about how,

1028
01:01:59,351 --> 01:02:00,380
why he got 'em.

1029
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:04,470
He got hit with some elbows and one
of his fights in Vegas and the, uh,

1030
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:07,830
the doctor,
you staples and the doctor was so shitty.

1031
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:12,840
He actually stapled like one of the
things was in the crease of the actual cut

1032
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:16,570
instead of like pinching the cut
together to staple, went in the hole.

1033
01:02:16,571 --> 01:02:20,010
It was like this fucking guy was
blind or drunk. Now we know. What

1034
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,530
people don't realize is
when you go to a doctor,

1035
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:27,960
a doctor is not worried about how you're
going to look after. It's about healing.

1036
01:02:27,961 --> 01:02:31,650
Whatever is ready. I gotta
close this whole, I have to,

1037
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:35,520
I have to fix this thing. It's like an
artist. He's not an artist. Exactly.

1038
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,730
So when you go to see these
doctors and they give you stitches,

1039
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,050
you are going to have a nasty scar. In
fact, I don't care who your doctor is.

1040
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,290
That's a fact. That's the way it goes. And
they do that though. Can they fix that?

1041
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:50,460
And they score a Redo it
with like a really good job
of playbook for like a girl

1042
01:02:50,461 --> 01:02:51,294
like Jessica panic.

1043
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:55,020
It would cost her a ton of money to go do
it later and all this stuff. Fuck that.

1044
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:55,621
Let's just get it.

1045
01:02:55,621 --> 01:02:59,310
They might not even work because like
there's going to be all that scar tissue

1046
01:02:59,311 --> 01:03:03,630
and healing from Yammer sutures and you
have to cut that out. Maybe. I don't know.

1047
01:03:03,631 --> 01:03:06,690
What am I? I'm just making shit up
that, listen, there's the eds, you know,

1048
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:09,310
there's a completely different,
um,

1049
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:12,860
angle to this thing now when dealing
with women, we have women who fight me.

1050
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:17,910
You can't have Jessica Penne a
scar on her nose and stuff.

1051
01:03:17,911 --> 01:03:21,600
Like I said, we get a lot of shit. We take
care of a lot of people now with what,

1052
01:03:21,601 --> 01:03:26,400
it really comes down to it. You know,
we don't say, Hey, send Jessica Penne,

1053
01:03:26,401 --> 01:03:27,580
I over to some doctor in stitcher.

1054
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:32,490
We sent her to the baddest plastic
surgeon in La and he fixed her nose,

1055
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:36,960
sent Robbie Lawler to a guy who fixed
his lip chocolate doubt and his LePen

1056
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,070
Rhonda and her lip,
which is broken.

1057
01:03:38,071 --> 01:03:42,280
We literally got the best plastic
surgeon in Australia, not,

1058
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,190
not Melbourne. We've got the best
guy in Australia. Um, you know,

1059
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:50,670
so we're, we're, we're pretty big on
the medical side with the fighters.

1060
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:52,890
Yeah. I mean it's, it's,

1061
01:03:52,891 --> 01:03:57,730
it's gotta be like an incredibly difficult
job to do, to like stitch up, uh,

1062
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:02,070
a cut like that and it makes sure
that it heals. And a nice theme,

1063
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:05,340
clean line like that. You
know, my friend John Wayne par,

1064
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:08,540
he was at the fights last night.
He's 10 time World Moy,

1065
01:04:08,541 --> 01:04:10,290
Thai champions and Australian guy.

1066
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:14,580
He's had more than 300
stitches in his face,

1067
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:19,550
in his face. That's crazy. With that.

1068
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:23,880
Um, no thank you. Yeah.
Thank you very much.

1069
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:29,640
Thank you.
I saw this stuff.

1070
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:32,910
We want you to hear what it's like
in first class people just to,

1071
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:36,750
just to give you a little taste.
Knollies no chill clip. No,

1072
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:40,480
I got some child. Anything
at all. I can get coffee.

1073
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:45,390
Yeah.
Is there a blowjob?

1074
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:49,780
I'm saying they didn't offer you that.
Oh yeah, it was, it was the guy though.

1075
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,080
The guy, his name's Joe and it
was amazing by the way, but to

1076
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:56,493
bed too.

1077
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:04,260
It's really incredible though.
Like, like what you do.

1078
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,860
It's amazing.
I grew up in and chose about to kill me.

1079
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:12,990
I grew up a huge pro wrestling fan
and there's something about what Vince

1080
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:17,990
Mcmahon has been able to accomplish with
the crazy circus that he's running and

1081
01:05:18,071 --> 01:05:21,190
turn it into a huge company with
tons of bands and watch every week,

1082
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:26,400
even though it's all fake and you've
been able to fake or real life cause like

1083
01:05:26,401 --> 01:05:30,250
always say, great. I've always
admitted that on your show. What is it?

1084
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:33,540
You're the only one that keeps
making it look, what does it to make?

1085
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:37,180
Still fake always has been
bullshit. Right? Right. Just
like your game of Thrones.

1086
01:05:37,181 --> 01:05:39,460
Exactly.
What's wrong.

1087
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:44,730
But it's amazing to me that you have
been able to accomplish what that with

1088
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:49,420
reality,
like everything he did,

1089
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:52,720
he wrote it out himself
and wrote scripts and has,

1090
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:58,060
they have 2030 writers that
he pays six figures a year,

1091
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:02,830
big time, more than six regular,
like lower middle six figures a year.

1092
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:07,830
They all get paid to write that stuff
every week and you have been able to grow

1093
01:06:08,681 --> 01:06:11,800
this thing.
And I guess that's really like,

1094
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:16,210
it's mind blowing because you
get those writers all day.

1095
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,990
You're never going to do
what Conor McGregor can do.
Just on instinct. I have to,

1096
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,870
I have this thing that reality is better
than any script you could ever. Right.

1097
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:27,460
And, and, and that's the reason that you
see, so it's so real and it's so like,

1098
01:06:27,461 --> 01:06:28,420
like last night,
man,

1099
01:06:28,421 --> 01:06:33,130
you put on the fight with
the best fighters in the
world and reality is going to

1100
01:06:33,131 --> 01:06:34,990
happen, man. And when you see it,

1101
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:39,710
it goes fucking global and electric
like it did last night, man.

1102
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:44,620
Even triple h what? Aaa chip
me up last night and said, wow.

1103
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:48,010
He goes, what? A show and want a shocker.

1104
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:51,760
That's what triple h me with
last night. It's like, you know,

1105
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:56,590
w w when you do have that reality and
it goes off like it went off last night,

1106
01:06:56,591 --> 01:06:58,660
it's, it's bigger than anything
you could ever write in.

1107
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:03,160
What it does is it makes it so that
you never know what's going to happen.

1108
01:07:03,161 --> 01:07:08,161
Now people have to watch every fight
because people can hate and people can say

1109
01:07:08,171 --> 01:07:12,520
that they knew that home was going to win.
That's the biggest bigger.

1110
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:13,840
It's bigger than this plane.

1111
01:07:13,841 --> 01:07:17,270
The amount of bullshit that
nobody knew that was going to go.

1112
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:21,190
Even the people who bet on Holly
and had all this shit last night.

1113
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:25,480
There's one reason, one reason only, that
they bet on holiday because of the odds.

1114
01:07:25,870 --> 01:07:30,730
Odds were so big. Why not take
a shot or they were her family

1115
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:34,840
or a family or friend?
Hello.

1116
01:07:38,790 --> 01:07:41,080
Would that be more comfortable?
We're good. We're good.

1117
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:47,870
No, he's, he's a Ninja. He's
an acrobat. You can flip.

1118
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:51,840
These are all my people here.

1119
01:07:57,510 --> 01:07:59,830
No, no, we're good, but
thank you though. Thank you.

1120
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:05,200
So nice hair. That was
a polite, strong arm.

1121
01:08:05,201 --> 01:08:07,070
She was trying to strong arm us up to the,
uh,

1122
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:09,630
to the lounge and Joe shutters down.

1123
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:15,980
That was dated. Get Low. Yeah, she
was definitely, that was her polite

1124
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:18,770
way of saying you guys should go up.
Don't match. People want to sleep now.

1125
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:24,130
Is that what, is sleep at like 10 in
the morning or something? Fucking time.

1126
01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:27,210
You have a, we're landing at six in the
morning and write, but what time is it?

1127
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:33,390
What time is it in la? Well, it's
only 3:00 PM in Australia. Okay.

1128
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:36,260
People want to go to sleep.
That's their fucking problem also.

1129
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,260
That means it's the, but it's not. That
will be the middle of the night in Vegas.

1130
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:44,580
In La is eight 28 20 La
and 3:20 PM in Australia.

1131
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:49,970
I haven't been able to sleep
since I got here. I'm so confused.

1132
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:52,910
I sleep like three hours a week.
I've got five in the morning.

1133
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:55,880
I'll fall asleep and pill for
you, pal, if you want to take it.

1134
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:59,420
Don't take sleeping pills,
man. I don't take them.

1135
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:01,900
It's not only one you don't
do as a sleeping pills.

1136
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:06,530
I want to be able to wake up at all.

1137
01:09:06,531 --> 01:09:11,360
Like I was in a hotel fire in San
Francisco in the middle of the night.

1138
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:13,370
It was a, it was actually,
it wasn't a fire.

1139
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:18,580
So people that set off the
fire extinguishers and it
filled the room up with

1140
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:22,070
that smoke, you know, that, that fog
of those fire extinguishers green.

1141
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:26,330
And it was four 30 in the morning. These
alarms went off. Plam Pam, Pam, Pam,

1142
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:28,460
I got up,
didn't know what the fuck was going on.

1143
01:09:28,461 --> 01:09:31,760
I'm trying to shut my alarm
clock. Rob. We, no, no, I didn't.

1144
01:09:31,761 --> 01:09:35,240
But all the people that were
in the fucking hotel and
sleeping pills and it was

1145
01:09:35,241 --> 01:09:38,570
in San Francisco and he had this narrow
staircase and it's really hard to get

1146
01:09:38,571 --> 01:09:41,270
down the stairs. It's like
really narrow. And uh,

1147
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:46,300
these people were walking like real slow
down the stairs and half of them were

1148
01:09:46,521 --> 01:09:49,520
fucking sleeping.
They're like waking up as it were walking.

1149
01:09:49,521 --> 01:09:51,200
They were all whacked
out on sleeping pills.

1150
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:54,050
Cause a lot of people when they
stay in hotels or when they travel,

1151
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:57,050
they'll take a sleeping
pill and it was dangerous.

1152
01:09:57,051 --> 01:09:59,690
It was dangerous to the point where I
was ready to start a fucking stampede.

1153
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:03,170
I was like, like, like why
are you fuckers not running?

1154
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:07,490
Like there's a alarm going off and
announcement saying the building's on fire

1155
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:11,090
and you people are strolling down the
stair and half of them look like zombies.

1156
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:13,480
And um,
um,

1157
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:17,030
I've had some friends that have done
some shit when they on sleeping pills.

1158
01:10:17,031 --> 01:10:17,870
Like Kevin James,

1159
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:22,010
Kevin James takes sleeping pills to like
cook himself dinner and doesn't realize

1160
01:10:22,011 --> 01:10:24,410
he cooked dinner and wake up in the
morning like, what the fuck is this?

1161
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:28,160
And then someone has to tell him that he
cooked it. Like I'm not down with that.

1162
01:10:28,161 --> 01:10:31,760
I've seen some crazy. She had to
asleep and us. Man, what's funny,

1163
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:34,410
I took one number. I told you on the
way here, I took one when I saw it,

1164
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,730
a sleeping pill, I woke up,
my throat was so fucking so,

1165
01:10:37,731 --> 01:10:39,790
I dunno if I was snoring like a biester.

1166
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:45,830
I don't know. I don't have
that. You usually don't have
a problem with sleeping.

1167
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:49,610
And I figure if I'm not awake or if
not, I'm not sleeping. I'm awake,

1168
01:10:49,611 --> 01:10:52,460
I'll do something and then they'll
do something, tell him tired,

1169
01:10:52,461 --> 01:10:55,580
then I'll sleep and when I get back to la,
LP blacked out.

1170
01:10:55,581 --> 01:10:59,390
But I just work out and I'll deal
with it, you know? I don't know.

1171
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:00,790
I'm not into

1172
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:07,040
the drugs that I like that they're
like, uh, you know, they don't,

1173
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:10,400
they don't incapacitate you like that.
I'm not into like,

1174
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:13,980
I'm not in the sedatives. Right. Got It.

1175
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:18,570
I'm just sleeping pills either. But if
I need to fall asleep on this flight,

1176
01:11:18,571 --> 01:11:21,360
I might go a couple rows back
and have Holly Holm kicked me in.

1177
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:24,990
The neck is hard to judge.
She's not even on the flight.

1178
01:11:24,991 --> 01:11:27,170
She's probably still back in
Australia. Right? I think,

1179
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,950
well she was trying to leave today.

1180
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,910
She was supposed to stay a couple more
days and then she changed her mind and

1181
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,620
want to leave today.
So I don't know if she got out or not.

1182
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:38,730
Do you schedule fighters to leave a
couple of days after? So they can recover.

1183
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:43,680
Yeah. You give the, the fighters on the
car to a couple of days that you still,

1184
01:11:43,681 --> 01:11:45,750
you'll see fighters
getting on all banged up.

1185
01:11:45,751 --> 01:11:49,800
And I was just always think after
you've had a fight, you should,

1186
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:53,080
you should recite a couple
of days without a doubt,

1187
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:57,430
without some people want to get right
home. Can't tell them what to do. Right.

1188
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:01,090
Just imagine that like
after a brutal fight,

1189
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:04,230
a year ahead would be so fucking swollen.

1190
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:07,640
Everything you wouldn't want to get
on a plane like it is. It sucks.

1191
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:08,830
And being on a plane when you're,

1192
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:09,990
he knows his stuff.
It's true.

1193
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:15,620
People don't really understand or
appreciate how fucking tough these human

1194
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:19,950
beings really are, that compete. The FCA
man, these guys are so tough and girls,

1195
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:23,730
it's, it's, it's, it's pretty fucking
spectacular how tough these people are.

1196
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:27,200
When you were talking about the Robbie
Lawler and Rory Macdonald fight,

1197
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:30,420
and after that fight,
Robbie Rory rather, uh,

1198
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:35,530
tweeted a photo of his face like the
next day and his eyes were close shot and

1199
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:38,930
his nose was fucked up.
And what's crazy about,

1200
01:12:38,931 --> 01:12:42,120
and he said that it was the greatest
night of his life. You know,

1201
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,990
like that's how you know,
you're supposed to be a fighter.

1202
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:49,170
That's it. Are there, they're
special people. They're
different than all of us, man.

1203
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:54,390
We, uh, that's why I, when
I think about fighting,

1204
01:12:55,620 --> 01:13:00,180
these people are so special that
very few people can actually do it.

1205
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:00,721
You know,

1206
01:13:00,721 --> 01:13:05,090
how many people can actually become a top
three fighter in the fucking world and

1207
01:13:05,091 --> 01:13:08,730
how many people can become a champion
and then hold the belt for any amount of

1208
01:13:08,731 --> 01:13:13,530
time? Very few people.
It's, they're very special.

1209
01:13:13,531 --> 01:13:17,970
And I think that's why as human beings,
we're sewing on a professional fighters.

1210
01:13:17,971 --> 01:13:21,870
You know, I always say that, that it
out findings in our fucking DNA and we,

1211
01:13:21,871 --> 01:13:25,590
and we just, we, we look at
fighters and we're like, Holy Shit,

1212
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,960
that fucking guy is the
toughest dude in the world.

1213
01:13:27,961 --> 01:13:32,610
Or that girl is the toughest girl in the
world and why we put them on such a big

1214
01:13:32,611 --> 01:13:35,700
pedestal that they deserve to be.
But at the same time,

1215
01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:39,060
the craziest loneliest fucking,
you know,

1216
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:42,350
Ronda Rousey loses one fight
and everybody turns on her.

1217
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:47,250
So she had the Anderson Silva loses one
flight. He was never that fucking good.

1218
01:13:47,251 --> 01:13:51,210
Anyway, the 85 pound division isn't weak.
It's just, it's the craziest fucking,

1219
01:13:51,211 --> 01:13:51,550
yeah.

1220
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:53,250
You know what that is is,
is people,

1221
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:58,280
the people that are mean and nasty and
insulting after fights are the weakest

1222
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:00,540
aspects of humanity.

1223
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:05,840
They're the people that are scared and
terrified and they know they could never

1224
01:14:06,211 --> 01:14:10,110
do that. So when someone does
do that and falters they just,

1225
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,960
because that's their own demons,

1226
01:14:16,961 --> 01:14:21,961
their own insecurity there
all the knowledge that they
could never do that in a

1227
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,400
million years.
So when someone does it and fails,

1228
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:28,150
all of their insecurities just come flying
out of their stupid fucking mouth or

1229
01:14:28,151 --> 01:14:29,950
their fingers.
That's what it is.

1230
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:33,730
When when I went on Instagram last night
and Twitter and I was reading all that

1231
01:14:33,731 --> 01:14:37,270
means shit that people were typing about
Rhonda, I knew what the fuck that is.

1232
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:40,180
That's the weakest aspects of humanity.

1233
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:43,420
If we could pluck those
people out of our culture,

1234
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:47,110
the world will be a way better place.
And if the people listening to this,

1235
01:14:47,111 --> 01:14:50,500
if you're one of those people you
need to fucking go for a walk,

1236
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:53,800
recognize who you are because
that's why you did that.

1237
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:56,050
That woman put at both of those women,

1238
01:14:56,170 --> 01:15:01,170
put everything that they are on the line
and for you to insult them after they

1239
01:15:01,511 --> 01:15:05,930
came up short. The reason why you're
doing that because you're a con,

1240
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:10,740
you're a con of epic
proportions and there's no way
around that. There's no, no.

1241
01:15:10,741 --> 01:15:13,780
It might go up. You might actually know
something. No, you don't know shit. No,

1242
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:16,000
you're a con because if you do no shit,

1243
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:21,100
you would just look at it and you
would recognize the sacrifice and the,

1244
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:25,510
the, the drama of it all and the danger
of it all and you would have respect for

1245
01:15:25,511 --> 01:15:25,780
them.

1246
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:26,780
That's true.
So,

1247
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:31,890
so well said and these special individuals
who want this fucking earth and go

1248
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:36,430
out and fight in front of millions
of people and lay it all on the line.

1249
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:37,490
You know,

1250
01:15:37,490 --> 01:15:41,980
and I've seen guys walk in
with the fucking belt and
an entourage go home and a

1251
01:15:41,981 --> 01:15:45,200
fucking ambulance and by
themselves since raise them. Yeah.

1252
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:48,510
That's when they find out
who's really their friend.
But it all goes down. I mean,

1253
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:52,500
how many fighters have developed
these gigantic entourage? It's like,

1254
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:56,670
remember Mike Tyson in his
prime was buying everybody.
Look at Floyd Mayweather.

1255
01:15:56,940 --> 01:16:01,260
Floyd Mayweather is hanging around with a,
he's got a God damn army with them.

1256
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:06,450
It's mainly parky out knocked him dad.
You know,

1257
01:16:06,451 --> 01:16:10,620
it's one of those guys knocked him dead.
All those dudes would disappear.

1258
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:13,910
Everybody would disappear if he
went broke. Everybody would this.

1259
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:18,160
As soon as he retires,
he has retired for what?

1260
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:20,160
I don't believe it.
I think he'll be back.

1261
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,870
I'll be back for at least one more fight.

1262
01:16:21,871 --> 01:16:24,390
Especially Manny Pacquiao started
talking about coming back.

1263
01:16:24,391 --> 01:16:27,390
Why wouldn't he come back and make
another hundred million dollars? Right?

1264
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,090
But I think that this,

1265
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:34,020
the cling ons and the hangers
on and the yes people,

1266
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:38,190
there's some of the most dangerous
people for a fighter's ego because what a

1267
01:16:38,191 --> 01:16:41,070
fighter wants,
they want affirmation.

1268
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:45,900
They don't want to like a reinforcement
of the love that they're missing,

1269
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:48,150
which kind of leads them to
fighting in the first place.

1270
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:51,570
And they surround themselves with all
these people that are boosting their ego

1271
01:16:51,571 --> 01:16:55,740
up. Those people are fucking dangerous
for you though. So I like, have you seen,

1272
01:16:56,130 --> 01:16:57,540
have you seen what Teddy Atlas is doing?

1273
01:16:57,690 --> 01:17:00,940
Teddy houses training Timothy
Bradley now. So amazing. He's,

1274
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:03,540
he Bradley's last fight. You know,
we talked about, I can see it,

1275
01:17:03,541 --> 01:17:07,140
but you said it was awesome.
Phenomenal. Bradley looked fantastic,

1276
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:11,390
but one of the best parts about it,
as Teddy Atlas said, no entourage,

1277
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:16,520
no cell phones, no nothing. He doesn't
want music plan. No one's in there.

1278
01:17:16,521 --> 01:17:21,110
It's just him and him. They look at
each other, they go over technique,

1279
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:24,800
they focus on the game plan. They focus
on what the work there has to be done.

1280
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:26,270
And that's it.
You know,

1281
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:30,980
Floyd Mayweather has got a goddamn circus
and he's counted and he could pull it

1282
01:17:30,981 --> 01:17:33,410
off with that surface.
Right? But the moment he can,

1283
01:17:33,411 --> 01:17:35,450
and those guys have to
go out and get real jobs.

1284
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:38,300
It's a moment he finds out that
they weren't really his friends.

1285
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,720
They were paid friends,
they were employed friends,

1286
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:45,560
friends that were there to try to
boost his ego up. And there are only,

1287
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:49,370
they're only occupation. It's like
they're, they're professional friends.

1288
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:52,070
They're there to be Floyd
Mayweather, his friends. Yup.

1289
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:55,540
Floyd is Floyd's good at the surface
though, you know, and all it,

1290
01:17:55,580 --> 01:18:00,080
the best Floyd had the circus, you
know, people weren't as interested. He,

1291
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:04,000
he really took it to another level when,
when, when he was pretty boy Floyd,

1292
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:08,510
nobody can, nobody can became
money. Mayweather. Everybody
cared. He's a wizard.

1293
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:10,940
I mean, look, that's the same
thing with Rhonda. You know,

1294
01:18:10,941 --> 01:18:14,540
Lady Gaga doesn't fucking get it.
Like all these people don't get it.

1295
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:18,620
Like half of what Rhonda does is
psychological, but half of it's marketing.

1296
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:21,830
All that stuff is marketing. You
know, you talk all that crazy shit.

1297
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,210
That's where you get all the money.

1298
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:26,840
The money comes from what Conor
Mcgregor's doing, you know, Bill with, oh,

1299
01:18:26,841 --> 01:18:28,520
I don't like what Conor Mcgregor's doing.

1300
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,950
Mixed martial arts is
supposed to be about respect,

1301
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:34,340
but you got maybe 10
years if you're lucky.

1302
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:37,520
But realistically the great fighters,
you'll get the great fighters,

1303
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:40,940
they have like an eight year period
that they can operate at this incredibly

1304
01:18:40,941 --> 01:18:45,650
high rpm and then your body starts giving
out. You can't take any shots anymore.

1305
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,110
Your fucking knees or bad,
your back goes bad,

1306
01:18:48,111 --> 01:18:51,970
you're next all fucked up at a
certain point in time, it fails you.

1307
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:55,280
You have two things you're trying
to accomplish during that time.

1308
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:58,340
You're trying to win. We're trying
to make as much money as they can.

1309
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,910
And the best way to make as much
money is get people to pay attention.

1310
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:06,020
And the best way to get people to pay
attention as to talk out gang. I Shit,

1311
01:19:06,570 --> 01:19:07,680
I'm going to tell you right now.

1312
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:12,420
So I was laying in bed last night
after the fight, you know, and, and,

1313
01:19:12,421 --> 01:19:15,420
and Melbourne,
the fight was over around five something.

1314
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:20,340
We were all back at our hotels by
nine. Um, the notorious was on,

1315
01:19:20,341 --> 01:19:21,174
have you seen

1316
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:25,620
that is a fucking ratio man.

1317
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,410
They literally ran five
episodes of it last night.

1318
01:19:28,411 --> 01:19:31,620
I laid in bed and watch five fucking
episodes back to back. I'm like,

1319
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:36,060
Jesus Christ, this is really fucking
good. It's a good show. I mean it's,

1320
01:19:36,061 --> 01:19:40,500
it's unbelievable. They just follow
this kid around and it is compelling.

1321
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,000
Great television.

1322
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:46,800
He's a wizard and it's amazing because
it does this thing where either you fall

1323
01:19:46,801 --> 01:19:47,970
in love with them,
right?

1324
01:19:47,971 --> 01:19:52,350
And this goes for Mcgregor Mayweather
and Rousey at the fall in love with them

1325
01:19:52,410 --> 01:19:56,250
and you want to watch them retain their
chief in ship or you start to hate them

1326
01:19:56,670 --> 01:20:00,930
and you want to watch them lose. Either
way you're watching and it's beautiful.

1327
01:20:00,931 --> 01:20:02,340
And again,
you know,

1328
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,380
pro wrestling

1329
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:09,460
smeared as it is, the fact that it's
not real and this and that, you know,

1330
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:13,110
that's definitely something that, you
know, they built their entire Moi.

1331
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,660
Yeah. Pro Wrestling fans are going to
go crazy. That hear you say that. I,

1332
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:21,850
I you hear what I call the fake that
time I had every crazy lunatic pro

1333
01:20:21,851 --> 01:20:24,520
wrestling fan on my
fucking Twitter for like

1334
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:30,000
three weeks, man. Well, Tony, I did
a podcast and a, there's like, well,

1335
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:32,670
there's only a few times
while I've gotten, like,

1336
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,700
there's two times when I got like more
hate than anything I've ever done.

1337
01:20:35,970 --> 01:20:38,790
One of them was a,
when I said that Fallon Fox,

1338
01:20:38,791 --> 01:20:41,310
that man that became a woman
shouldn't be fighting women.

1339
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:46,460
I got all the fucking progressive's and
social justice warriors coming after me

1340
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:47,650
being a trans folk.

1341
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:52,740
And the other time was when I said that
pro wrestling was retarded because Tony

1342
01:20:52,741 --> 01:20:55,110
and I did a podcast and I just
mocked him for about an hour.

1343
01:20:55,380 --> 01:21:00,100
I got all fucking tsunami of
misspelled tweets my way. Just,

1344
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:04,920
Ooh. I was like, I was drowning in
misspelled tweets and I was like,

1345
01:21:04,921 --> 01:21:08,000
I just wanted to correct their
drug. The grammar, that's not your,

1346
01:21:08,001 --> 01:21:12,080
it's y o U Apostrophe,
r, e Fox. And I was like,

1347
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:15,680
I got the same thing people were called.

1348
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:20,650
Then there's these guys that
used to wrestle and guys
that have podcasts and all

1349
01:21:20,651 --> 01:21:24,010
these things that were on there.
And then, and then the stone cold,

1350
01:21:24,011 --> 01:21:26,700
Steve Austin came to my rescue.
So listen,

1351
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:28,900
I don't think that he was saying
he said fake, but you know,

1352
01:21:28,901 --> 01:21:32,380
they don't know the work and that that's
that. And he didn't mean any disrespect.

1353
01:21:32,381 --> 01:21:35,500
You know, stone called had to come and
save me from all the fucking [inaudible].

1354
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:37,420
That's what happens.

1355
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:39,710
Fully did that for me.

1356
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:43,500
Yeah. Mick Foley for the man,
everybody knows that it's fake.

1357
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:48,770
Where they get super defensive and crazy
is if you say that they're not like

1358
01:21:48,931 --> 01:21:52,500
real athletes because they do like
every night. You know what I mean?

1359
01:21:52,501 --> 01:21:56,070
They do a different marina every night
and on Mondays it's filmed and then they

1360
01:21:56,071 --> 01:21:57,770
do pay per views on Sundays.
That's it.

1361
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,900
The only thing that really
Ruckus is up the fans.

1362
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:03,080
If you say that like those
guys aren't real app.

1363
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:05,080
Well they,
it is a tough job.

1364
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:09,520
Those guys put in some fucking
serious numbers. I mean,

1365
01:22:09,521 --> 01:22:10,960
how many days a year they go on the road?

1366
01:22:10,961 --> 01:22:14,650
Like that was one of the reasons why
Brock Lesnar decided that fighting in the

1367
01:22:14,651 --> 01:22:18,280
fucking UFC at the highest
level of the game, which one,

1368
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:23,230
one previous MMA fight was
easier than doing pro wrestling.

1369
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:26,260
That goes to show you how hard that,
that entertainment business has.

1370
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:27,141
It's true,
man,

1371
01:22:27,141 --> 01:22:32,141
that they're on the road like 330 days
a year and a 230 days in here and wait,

1372
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:39,020
no, three 30, I think it's three
30. It's a big number. It's a lot.

1373
01:22:39,021 --> 01:22:41,250
Most of the entire year.
And they're always in pain.

1374
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:43,530
It's why a lot of them have pain,
pill problems.

1375
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:48,570
Every one of the people over
at the WWE or fans of UFC.

1376
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:53,800
And anytime I've ever had any type of
interaction with the WWE, you know,

1377
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:58,770
uh, star, they're always really good
people. Really good people. Really Nice,

1378
01:22:59,070 --> 01:23:01,890
totally respectful,
just like the best people to deal with.

1379
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:06,010
So I have nothing against
wrestling at all. Do you think cm

1380
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:10,600
punk is ever going to actually
fight? I do. Yeah. So what
happened was he got hurt.

1381
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:14,260
He hurt his shoulder and
he was fucking devastated.

1382
01:23:14,261 --> 01:23:18,040
He thought he was going to have to have
surgery and he did. And he actually,

1383
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:21,190
he lucked out and got out with therapy.
And uh,

1384
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:24,490
so he's went through his therapy and he's,
he's coming back now.

1385
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:28,720
Tell them to go to doctor d to take them
to that guy in Vegas and get the stem

1386
01:23:28,721 --> 01:23:30,040
cells.
Oh my God.

1387
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:33,100
Maybe I will tell him that you should get
stem cells in every part of your body.

1388
01:23:33,101 --> 01:23:36,130
Just do it. Trust me. The
greatest thing I've ever done,

1389
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:38,980
I'm going back in December.
I'm just want to start shooting shit up.

1390
01:23:39,190 --> 01:23:40,570
Shoot my elbows up,
tuck it.

1391
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:44,980
Duane Ludwig told me did that Dwayne
has hips done and shoulders done.

1392
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:46,300
Didn't even need anything wrong.

1393
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:50,290
Just just decided to just get stem
cells shot in there to heal things.

1394
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:53,350
It's incredible.
This is total next level shit.

1395
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:58,470
You were saying that that guy in Germany,
what's his name? Peter a Dr. Beard.

1396
01:23:58,510 --> 01:24:02,380
Rolling. Tell me, what was he saying about
the college and thing? Yeah, so they're,

1397
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,800
they're working on this
thing over there were,

1398
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:08,560
you know how testosterone replacement
therapy works. You know, as we get older,

1399
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:11,380
our testosterone levels drop
and then they can, you know,

1400
01:24:11,381 --> 01:24:14,650
give you an injection and put this,
this testosterone back into your body,

1401
01:24:14,651 --> 01:24:17,590
make it feel younger, sex, life,
all these other things. Well.

1402
01:24:17,591 --> 01:24:22,480
Now what these guys are working
on is these collagen shots.

1403
01:24:22,481 --> 01:24:26,350
So they give you these injections of
Collagen and it replaces the college in

1404
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:30,850
your body. Collagen is what keeps your
skin young and as we all get older,

1405
01:24:30,851 --> 01:24:33,280
it goes away and they did this thing,

1406
01:24:33,281 --> 01:24:38,281
I guess that they've been testing on this
10 year old rat and the rat looks like

1407
01:24:38,651 --> 01:24:42,040
a fucking rat.
Looks like a baby rat now.

1408
01:24:43,390 --> 01:24:47,860
So they're, they're literally right
now, I guess this shit's ready to go.

1409
01:24:47,861 --> 01:24:50,230
They're just building up
the infrastructure over
there because when they,

1410
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:54,520
when this thing comes out and when
they announced this is going to be $1

1411
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:58,060
trillion business, it's going
to be ridiculous. That was it.

1412
01:24:58,330 --> 01:25:02,140
They're injecting collagen
or the injecting something
that makes you regenerate

1413
01:25:02,141 --> 01:25:06,270
college. Again, don't take the fucking,
you know, I can't give you the, you know,

1414
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:08,140
the scientific explanation of it,

1415
01:25:08,141 --> 01:25:12,070
but they basically came up with this thing
where you get these injections and it

1416
01:25:12,071 --> 01:25:13,000
makes you younger.
Again,

1417
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:18,060
it's almost like replacing the Collagen
in your body and your wrinkles go away.

1418
01:25:18,910 --> 01:25:22,120
They go away and your face looks like
your face. Look when you were younger.

1419
01:25:22,121 --> 01:25:24,180
So ladies out there that
are banging your face,

1420
01:25:24,181 --> 01:25:26,590
it's all up with all this
crazy shit that they're doing.

1421
01:25:27,150 --> 01:25:29,050
A plastic surgeon and all this stuff.

1422
01:25:29,051 --> 01:25:31,750
I'd lay off and wait for this
stuff to come out. We're,

1423
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:35,950
we're fucking year away from this APP and
hang in there gals. Just hang in there.

1424
01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:39,040
You know, it's interesting, we were
talking about testosterone replacement.

1425
01:25:39,041 --> 01:25:44,041
That's been one of the
biggest controversies in MMA
over the last few years was

1426
01:25:45,341 --> 01:25:50,341
that for a while the Nevada state athletic
commission was allowing testosterone

1427
01:25:50,651 --> 01:25:53,440
use exemption.
So if you guys got it and you know,

1428
01:25:53,441 --> 01:25:58,441
Vituro may be unfairly takes the brunt
of the criticism for that because his

1429
01:25:58,451 --> 01:25:59,820
results on testosterone,

1430
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:03,840
we're so fucking spectacular when
you get an old guy like [inaudible]

1431
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:08,420
who has all that experience and all that
knowledge and you give him testosterone

1432
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:11,420
and his body performs like a young guys,
Bonnie.

1433
01:26:11,421 --> 01:26:14,120
But with all that knowledge
and all that experience,

1434
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:16,140
you get what happened
in the Henderson fight,

1435
01:26:16,141 --> 01:26:19,850
the Bisping fight and the Rockhold fight.
We just looked fucking sensational.

1436
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:23,360
But now, you know, now they pulled out,

1437
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,530
they pulled the testosterone
use exemptions back and
these guys are trying to

1438
01:26:27,531 --> 01:26:31,520
force to try to compete and
like Mark Hunt, perfect example,

1439
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:34,260
the first fight with bigfoot Silva,
uh,

1440
01:26:34,430 --> 01:26:39,430
and Mark Hunt was this crazy fucking
five round war and after the fight,

1441
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:44,380
big foot test, positive or not positive
because we knew he was on TestTalks.

1442
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:48,350
Steve was allowed to take it. He
actually, out of all the fucking people,

1443
01:26:48,410 --> 01:26:52,610
he's a guy that actually medically has
to take it and not because of his age,

1444
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:56,810
because he has some type of
pituitary pituitary gland.

1445
01:26:56,811 --> 01:26:58,490
It causes gigantism look,

1446
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:01,370
stops his body's production of a lot
of hormones and interrupts a lot of

1447
01:27:01,371 --> 01:27:01,730
hormones.

1448
01:27:01,730 --> 01:27:05,660
So he's the guy who actually really has
to take it or bad things can happen to

1449
01:27:05,661 --> 01:27:06,710
him.
And uh,

1450
01:27:07,670 --> 01:27:11,910
the problem was he took the shot the
week of the fight or two days before,

1451
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:14,300
you're not supposed to do that.
You are not supposed to do that.

1452
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:16,930
And the sad part is,
you know,

1453
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:21,380
some of these doctors say it wouldn't
even help them at the time that he took it

1454
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:25,460
to have that much in them. It wouldn't
even, we say that they say that,

1455
01:27:25,461 --> 01:27:28,670
but I don't think they know
because he, oh, that's the problem.

1456
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:32,810
The problem became that if
you talk to fucking six guys,

1457
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,550
they give you a six different answers.

1458
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:36,500
And that's what started
to happen with this shit.

1459
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:38,540
Nobody was really an expert on it.

1460
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:41,180
Nobody really knew what it
would do or wouldn't do.

1461
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:44,480
Then if you had two different,
if the commission had a doctor yet,

1462
01:27:44,481 --> 01:27:47,900
he was talking to his own doctor,
they would disagree on what the,

1463
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:49,110
you know what I mean?
So,

1464
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:51,770
and not to mention the fact
that if you have something good,

1465
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:54,920
when testosterone first came out and said,
well this is going to be good.

1466
01:27:55,210 --> 01:27:58,880
You know, guys can replace
it and guys careers and this,
that and everything else.

1467
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:02,600
But, but the other problem is is if
you have these guys who are like, well,

1468
01:28:02,601 --> 01:28:06,270
if this much is good for me, how
much is this going to do? Right?

1469
01:28:06,530 --> 01:28:07,990
So they're cheating on it.
So they're,

1470
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:13,240
they're basically doing their hope camp
using so much that they might as well

1471
01:28:13,341 --> 01:28:14,480
beyond steroids.
Yeah.

1472
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:17,530
Well they are on steroids. They're,
they're taking hyper human levels.

1473
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:20,980
And that was what, what had
happened with Mark Hunt. But look,

1474
01:28:20,981 --> 01:28:23,650
the proof is in the pudding because
if you watch that Mark Hunt fight,

1475
01:28:24,070 --> 01:28:26,320
Mark Hunt hit big foot with everything,

1476
01:28:26,321 --> 01:28:31,030
but the fucking kitchen sink and big
fudges ate it. He ate it. This all,

1477
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:35,380
and Mark Hunt's one of the
biggest knockout artists
in this sport and those two

1478
01:28:35,381 --> 01:28:38,350
went to war for five
rounds in the rematch.

1479
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:41,110
Big Foot's awesome off the
testosterone replacement.

1480
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:43,690
Mark Hunt hits him with one
clean right hand and drop it.

1481
01:28:44,410 --> 01:28:49,180
And Alex is big food is having
trouble taking his shirt off.

1482
01:28:49,470 --> 01:28:52,540
I know it sounds crazy, but like
it was like stumbling, taking,

1483
01:28:52,541 --> 01:28:55,450
it did look like he might have been
having problems with his shoulder or

1484
01:28:55,451 --> 01:28:56,850
something. Right. And Navy, Yeah.

1485
01:28:57,010 --> 01:29:00,730
Also just seemed a little bit of a slow
to come up the stairs and it's like

1486
01:29:00,731 --> 01:29:04,380
those aren't cutting weight, right?
No. Well maybe a little bit. Yeah.

1487
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:08,420
Baltimore to 65 I think they both weighed
in at 65 and how they did cut weight,

1488
01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:11,120
but Hans said he didn't have to cut
weight for this cause he dropped a lot of

1489
01:29:11,121 --> 01:29:13,680
weight training.
He looked a lot leaner.

1490
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,840
You look really good and you trade
with Mike Sweat over nick k by the way.

1491
01:29:17,841 --> 01:29:21,410
I couldn't be happier for him. Yeah, I
mean to dude. Good to see him succeed.

1492
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:23,510
Good stuff.
Yeah.

1493
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:27,300
The big filling on the scalp person,
he was slow,

1494
01:29:27,510 --> 01:29:32,220
slow in a few different ways and then
Mark Hunt was introduced and he came out

1495
01:29:32,221 --> 01:29:33,690
with this stuff already off.

1496
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:37,560
Like I said this before
on one of your podcasts,

1497
01:29:37,561 --> 01:29:40,170
but I feel like you can learn a
lot about them during the way.

1498
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:44,440
Yeah. So to tell them, look
into where everything relevant.
Yeah, it's everything.

1499
01:29:44,441 --> 01:29:46,900
You really do see
everything at the way end.

1500
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:49,690
See, please. Psychological,
and I mentioned this,

1501
01:29:49,691 --> 01:29:53,030
I don't think I mentioned this in this
podcast, but maybe yesterday. I said,

1502
01:29:53,890 --> 01:29:56,380
if you look at the way in
between Rosie and home,

1503
01:29:57,490 --> 01:30:01,810
exactly what Rhonda did at the way in is
what she did in the fight or the second

1504
01:30:01,811 --> 01:30:06,050
she got off that scale.
She ran over to home.

1505
01:30:06,130 --> 01:30:09,370
He was standing her ground
in her place and rushed her.

1506
01:30:09,580 --> 01:30:13,390
I mean she really bum rushed or I think
harder than Rhonda has ever win for

1507
01:30:13,391 --> 01:30:17,890
anybody. Even her last fight when the lady
said about her dad's suicide, you know,

1508
01:30:17,891 --> 01:30:19,210
don't kill yourself or whatever.

1509
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:23,560
She seemed more mad and
Holly Holm for what?

1510
01:30:23,561 --> 01:30:28,180
For drinking or drink and moving her hand
towards her a little bit like she bum

1511
01:30:28,181 --> 01:30:32,530
rushed her during the way and she did
exactly that way and exactly what she did

1512
01:30:32,531 --> 01:30:33,364
in the octagon.

1513
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:37,430
Didn't you say that the way in
change the betting line? Yeah,

1514
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,720
I did got changed.

1515
01:30:40,570 --> 01:30:44,120
The mind moved after the after the
way and moved and Holly's favorite.

1516
01:30:44,210 --> 01:30:45,740
Oh see yeah.

1517
01:30:46,010 --> 01:30:49,680
There's a lot of times the wins
tell you everything that's,

1518
01:30:49,681 --> 01:30:51,170
that's my second favorite day.

1519
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:56,710
It's the day that you get to see
who's on wait, how do they stare down?

1520
01:30:56,850 --> 01:30:59,370
Does it either Guy Flinch?
Does either one of them budge?

1521
01:30:59,390 --> 01:31:02,760
Does somebody have trying to get the
mental edge? It just, it's, it's,

1522
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:06,260
it's the fucking greatest day
of the week except for Saturday

1523
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:08,110
to break it down even more.

1524
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:13,200
I've watched the last four weigh ins of
Johana NJ check and this was the first

1525
01:31:14,831 --> 01:31:19,831
time that Valerie Laterno was the first
person that also put her head down and

1526
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:24,790
matched up with the Ohio Mason. No,
Valerie did that at the on sale too. Yeah.

1527
01:31:24,970 --> 01:31:27,480
And it's basically saying,
let's fuck fucking,

1528
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:29,370
I'm telling you dude,

1529
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:34,110
your dad on fucking right
on it when we were in, uh,

1530
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:39,090
whatever. I fucking luck when they
squared off a lot of, lot of the time,

1531
01:31:39,091 --> 01:31:42,660
my job is to make sure they don't touch
each other because when they touch each

1532
01:31:42,661 --> 01:31:47,640
other then people start
feeling disrespected and
whatever value return on laid

1533
01:31:47,641 --> 01:31:52,110
her fucking head right on top
of Joanna's at the item on sale.

1534
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:56,010
When we came out of here for the onsite
and they switched their fucking nose to

1535
01:31:56,011 --> 01:32:00,100
nose and
I have to kind of gauge what's

1536
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:03,220
going on there. So that shit doesn't
happen. And I felt that, that,

1537
01:32:03,221 --> 01:32:06,400
that they were both and I was
like, God damn, this is bad ass.

1538
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:09,730
I just let it happen because
they both just did it, you know,

1539
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:13,410
but you gotta be careful cause you'd let
guys do that and you'd get the core me

1540
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,270
Joan situation. You know what
I mean? It's real tricky,

1541
01:32:16,271 --> 01:32:19,120
but you're dead on with what you're
saying. And even that was the day I said,

1542
01:32:19,330 --> 01:32:22,480
well the turnover is here to fucking
white man. And not only that,

1543
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:26,340
but definitely a little bit more icing
on that cake when Johana and Laterno

1544
01:32:26,570 --> 01:32:29,710
we're heading the forehead. Johana was
talking and you asked her what she said,

1545
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:31,090
but if you watched that again,

1546
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:34,090
the allergies talking to and they're
just talking over each other,

1547
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:36,460
both saying stuff.
She wasn't listening to you.

1548
01:32:36,461 --> 01:32:38,140
I know in your mind I
wasn't listening to her.

1549
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:39,750
Craziest.
Well you don't want to said,

1550
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:45,140
I told her yesterday is your lucky day
today and tomorrow on my lucky days have

1551
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:50,880
some fucking creepy
fairytale hobbit type shit.

1552
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:55,970
Can we just the same way asked for
them and they're too slow for me.

1553
01:32:56,630 --> 01:32:58,330
She's a dean.
I gave her cooking

1554
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:02,990
theme and she's awesome.

1555
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:07,670
And I think that like having these two
champions in the women's divisions and

1556
01:33:07,671 --> 01:33:12,380
both of them now or just he's
skilled killers, you know
both of them. I mean look,

1557
01:33:12,381 --> 01:33:14,810
Ronda was a skilled Keller
Holly Holmes or skilled Keller.

1558
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:18,590
John is a skilled killer. These
are, there's a, there's so skillful.

1559
01:33:18,770 --> 01:33:23,770
It's like though the highest level
of MMA in the women's division is,

1560
01:33:24,130 --> 01:33:28,880
is like comparable to the highest
level of men's mmn. We absolutely,

1561
01:33:29,210 --> 01:33:33,500
I put you on a striking up with anybody
on the fucking planet that fights in MMA

1562
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:36,830
six times. World Muay Thai
champion, clean, striking.

1563
01:33:37,130 --> 01:33:41,850
I mean she's obviously 115 pounds so
she's not dropping people dead like rumble

1564
01:33:41,851 --> 01:33:45,500
Johnson is,
but she is fucking nasty.

1565
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:50,600
The first time I saw her I said she's my
favorite fighter and I make jokes about

1566
01:33:50,601 --> 01:33:52,940
one in the area and this and that.
Truth is,

1567
01:33:52,941 --> 01:33:56,840
I have a girlfriend who hates all this
Johana Mumbo jumbo when she reads it on

1568
01:33:56,841 --> 01:33:59,630
my Twitter. And a searching
what people are saying about me,

1569
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:02,990
who's this Johana Nj check? Would you
really hook up at their this and that.

1570
01:34:03,230 --> 01:34:04,400
The truth is,
you know,

1571
01:34:04,490 --> 01:34:07,790
I make the jokes about Johana cause I
say I need a woman that will keep me in

1572
01:34:07,791 --> 01:34:11,450
line. She's really just my
favorite fighter. I love UFC.

1573
01:34:11,451 --> 01:34:14,420
I've been watching it since Gracie
was in the, there's something about,

1574
01:34:14,421 --> 01:34:18,960
he'll honas straight clear name
back that she draws Joanna. Yolanda,

1575
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:22,200
Yolanda. I want to not Hannah.
Okay. Yolanda. Yolanda.

1576
01:34:22,310 --> 01:34:24,260
I mean just calling Joanna,

1577
01:34:27,140 --> 01:34:30,590
she's my favorite fight or the way that
she strikes and it's just fun to watch

1578
01:34:30,591 --> 01:34:33,410
it. There was a guy that through
four or five punches at a time,

1579
01:34:33,411 --> 01:34:37,200
all for the center of your nose. That
guy would be my favorite fighter. Yeah.

1580
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:39,770
And then you look at Holly Holm obviously,

1581
01:34:39,771 --> 01:34:43,430
which would Holly did last
night was perfect. I mean,

1582
01:34:43,431 --> 01:34:45,230
she fought the perfect fight.
She didn't,

1583
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:47,210
I mean there was nothing
amateurish about it.

1584
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:52,390
Nothing clumsier slopping that was as
skillful as you could ever hope for in a

1585
01:34:52,791 --> 01:34:54,530
professional mixed martial arts fight.

1586
01:34:54,890 --> 01:34:57,980
And the way she took advantage
of Rhonda at end of that, the

1587
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:59,760
exchange in the second round when you,

1588
01:34:59,910 --> 01:35:03,740
when when Rhonda was tired and she
slipped and she caught her with that punch

1589
01:35:03,741 --> 01:35:07,790
and then head kicked her. I mean that's,
it's perfect. It's perfect technique.

1590
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:11,930
Everything was perfect.
So we have now in women's MMA,

1591
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:16,960
we have the two representatives now in
the UFC there as skillful as anybody in

1592
01:35:17,241 --> 01:35:18,200
MMA.
It's true.

1593
01:35:18,230 --> 01:35:21,320
And then when you think about shaking
out the rest of that hundred 35 pound

1594
01:35:21,321 --> 01:35:26,030
division, you know, you, you,
you, you pair up any way you want.

1595
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:31,130
Amanda, Misha, Julianna Pena,

1596
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,980
just opinion. It's nice to have her back
to those four, those four women, you know,

1597
01:35:37,450 --> 01:35:41,330
in any mix and match that any
way you want. Well, you know,

1598
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:44,840
the perception was that Rhonda was at the
top of the heap and everybody else was

1599
01:35:44,841 --> 01:35:47,270
just under skilled. But man, that,

1600
01:35:47,271 --> 01:35:50,360
that perception's been blown
wide open by Holly Holm now.

1601
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:53,210
Now the whole game changes.
It just opens it, right?

1602
01:35:53,211 --> 01:35:56,810
It's like the same thing that happened
with buster Douglas knocked out Tyson and

1603
01:35:56,811 --> 01:35:59,720
then a Vander Holyfield came along and
knocked out buster Douglas. I mean,

1604
01:35:59,721 --> 01:36:00,740
the whole thing just more,

1605
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:06,440
it just throws the paradigm into a
fucking turmoil. It's true. And you know,

1606
01:36:06,441 --> 01:36:11,441
the thing about having someone like a
Rhonda Rousey or like a Yawner is that

1607
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:16,750
greatness beckons greatness when you
have one person at the top that is just

1608
01:36:17,181 --> 01:36:21,170
fantastic and spectacular and
has these incredible results.

1609
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:23,480
All these people that are coming up,

1610
01:36:23,481 --> 01:36:26,780
they have this insanely
high level to aspire to.

1611
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:31,760
And that's what makes mixed martial arts
so great in 2015 it's not a coincidence

1612
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:36,020
that if you go back to 1993 and you look
at the level of the fighters and then

1613
01:36:36,021 --> 01:36:40,430
you look at it in 2015 there's just
a head and shoulders above everybody.

1614
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,590
It's insight.
It's barely the same sport.

1615
01:36:42,890 --> 01:36:47,240
And the reason being is that slowly but
surely everybody aspired to the people

1616
01:36:47,241 --> 01:36:48,074
who are at the top.

1617
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:50,810
And the people coming up got better
and better and better and better.

1618
01:36:50,990 --> 01:36:53,180
And that's how we have the
level that we have today.

1619
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:56,840
And you're seeing that neared
now in the women's divisions,

1620
01:36:56,870 --> 01:36:58,820
and that's one of the most
exciting things about this room.

1621
01:36:59,070 --> 01:37:02,650
And it's that way, not only for the UFC,
but from life. You know what I mean?

1622
01:37:02,651 --> 01:37:06,040
Like sometimes I forget that until,
you know, I'll go once in a while,

1623
01:37:06,041 --> 01:37:10,920
a month or two without working
with you or you know, but like the,

1624
01:37:11,430 --> 01:37:15,070
there's only a few people left that I
watch. I do stand up comedy every night.

1625
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:17,410
I work really hard for
the last nine years,

1626
01:37:17,411 --> 01:37:21,970
basically training every night to get as
good as I can yet. But when I see you,

1627
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:24,100
Joey Diaz,
Bill Burr,

1628
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:27,190
which are the only three people
left that I'll even watch it,

1629
01:37:27,310 --> 01:37:30,280
it's a straight shot of
adrenaline inspiration.

1630
01:37:30,281 --> 01:37:34,690
All of a sudden I'm riding harder
the next day I'm sleeping. Right.

1631
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:37,450
Doing more things. The people, you know,

1632
01:37:37,630 --> 01:37:42,100
it's important to use inspiration to
your advantage for everything you know?

1633
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:46,980
Well, human beings, all, we all
need other people to inspire us.

1634
01:37:46,981 --> 01:37:47,720
We all do.

1635
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:52,720
It's one of the most in one of the most
important aspects of MMA is competition

1636
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:54,990
and the competition in between.
So I,

1637
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:58,710
these are not people that evolve in a
vacuum. They evolve looking at each other,

1638
01:37:58,730 --> 01:37:59,610
mirroring each other,

1639
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:03,960
and also now one of the things that we've
said many times is that martial arts

1640
01:38:03,961 --> 01:38:08,430
is evolved more since 1993 when the UFC
was founded than they have in the past

1641
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:10,830
10,000 years.
That's 100% true,

1642
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:13,920
but really one of the reasons why
it's true is because you can see the

1643
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:16,230
techniques.
You can actually watch them.

1644
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:21,500
I remember when I was a kid in 1986 I
went to watch the World Cup in Colorado

1645
01:38:21,931 --> 01:38:26,931
Springs in taekwondo and I flew out there
and it was a giant turning point in my

1646
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:30,660
taekwondo career because I
was, I was, I was really good.

1647
01:38:30,660 --> 01:38:35,490
I was winning like like good level
tournaments and I was doing well,

1648
01:38:35,670 --> 01:38:40,080
but in [inaudible] 86 when I went to
watch the best guys on the planet,

1649
01:38:40,110 --> 01:38:45,000
I came back 2030 40% better.
I was just way better.

1650
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:48,050
I saw the top of the mountain.
And I think when,

1651
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:50,970
when you get people that are
sitting in the crowd, you know,

1652
01:38:50,971 --> 01:38:54,390
you get these young contenders are
sitting there and they watch someone like

1653
01:38:54,391 --> 01:38:58,620
Holly Holm Dismantle Ronda Rousey did
watch someone like Chris Weidman knock out

1654
01:38:58,621 --> 01:39:02,760
Anderson Silva,
they watch Josie Aldo or Tj Dillashaw,

1655
01:39:02,761 --> 01:39:06,870
they Washington's fighters and they go
back to that gym and they're a different

1656
01:39:06,871 --> 01:39:07,740
fucking person.

1657
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:11,490
Jay Go back to that gym when they
have the memory of that spectacular

1658
01:39:11,491 --> 01:39:14,310
performance in their head and
it just makes them rise up.

1659
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:18,120
And I think also to people that don't
have anything to do with fighting,

1660
01:39:18,270 --> 01:39:21,600
don't watch that Holly Holm fight and
they'll wake up in the morning and they'll

1661
01:39:21,601 --> 01:39:24,510
go to their fucking yoga class
inspired, you know the, the,

1662
01:39:24,511 --> 01:39:28,890
we'll take spin classes, they'll go run
up hills there. They'll show up at work,

1663
01:39:28,891 --> 01:39:31,890
fucking fired up, ready to kick
some ass and get some shit done.

1664
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:35,810
Yeah. And it's so true. Champions
should take something from this cause.

1665
01:39:35,820 --> 01:39:39,810
What's one thing in my opinion that
Anderson Silva has lost a Weidman,

1666
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:44,790
the first one and this loss. Ronda
Rousey, Holly Holm have in common,

1667
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:50,270
and I see you go Silva was
showboating when he caught that punch,

1668
01:39:50,551 --> 01:39:52,140
maybe he would have lost anyway,

1669
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:55,620
but he was showboating he caught
it and it was over and I'm sorry,

1670
01:39:55,621 --> 01:39:58,440
but Rhonda was fighting with
pure ego yesterday. Her head,

1671
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:02,790
her chin was out or hands were low.
She was just bum rushing.

1672
01:40:02,850 --> 01:40:06,480
It seemed like she just thought
she was gonna out cushion.

1673
01:40:06,730 --> 01:40:09,490
I think it was more desperation in ego,
but it's,

1674
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:12,940
I think you're right in some ways,
but I think really instead of ego,

1675
01:40:12,941 --> 01:40:17,941
I think pressure is a better
thing to concentrate on the good.

1676
01:40:18,381 --> 01:40:21,110
I think both with Rhonda
and with Anderson,

1677
01:40:21,111 --> 01:40:24,220
many Anderson had the
pressure of everybody saying
he was the pound for pound,

1678
01:40:24,430 --> 01:40:28,840
greatest fighter of all time and he had
all these murderers coming up through

1679
01:40:28,841 --> 01:40:32,470
the ranks. Like why men, Yoel
Romero, all these Jocko Ray,

1680
01:40:32,471 --> 01:40:35,200
all these guys waiting in
line to get a shot at him.

1681
01:40:35,380 --> 01:40:39,970
And the pressure of that is just
overwhelming. But unlike Anderson,

1682
01:40:40,270 --> 01:40:43,720
or unlike Rhonda Rather Anderson
didn't have all these movie offers.

1683
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:46,490
He's not constantly doing
television shows and,

1684
01:40:46,510 --> 01:40:49,150
and I mean he had some media obligations,

1685
01:40:49,151 --> 01:40:53,050
especially particularly in Brazil
where you idolize. But Ron,

1686
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:54,220
Ron is on a totally different

1687
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:57,280
level. Enough credit for is the
guy was fucking 37, 38 years old.

1688
01:40:57,281 --> 01:40:58,820
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

1689
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:04,590
People forgot and he was so good and so
talented to still be doing what he was

1690
01:41:04,601 --> 01:41:08,800
doing at the level he was doing it
at 37 years old is unbelievable.

1691
01:41:09,090 --> 01:41:12,400
Are you guys going to do vetoer
versus Anderson? I don't know.

1692
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:16,040
That's the fight we're, I don't,
I don't, I don't disagree.

1693
01:41:16,890 --> 01:41:21,670
I love the fight. God
Vittoria into that. Uh,

1694
01:41:21,671 --> 01:41:24,400
I think Victoria is. Yes. When
does Anderson suspension go up?

1695
01:41:25,050 --> 01:41:29,170
Um, might be the first of the year. Oh,

1696
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:32,310
that's our fight.
That's the fight.

1697
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:38,540
Do you think they'll ever
be a time when marijuana is

1698
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:45,810
allowed in, in the UFC? Well, marijuana,

1699
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:48,010
these guys can do
whatever they want to do.

1700
01:41:48,011 --> 01:41:50,250
You can't do it the week of the fight.

1701
01:41:51,390 --> 01:41:53,180
Please not even legit.
Novitsky said,

1702
01:41:53,181 --> 01:41:57,700
it's like literally the day before the
fight now it's like you just can't fight,

1703
01:41:57,980 --> 01:41:59,570
whatever, whatever, whatever,

1704
01:42:00,290 --> 01:42:02,930
whatever it is that it's going to be out
of your system needs to be out of your

1705
01:42:02,931 --> 01:42:05,290
system by the fight. You can
do whatever you want. There's,

1706
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:09,080
there's so many misconceptions
about how this thing goes down.

1707
01:42:09,650 --> 01:42:12,970
Oh Jon Jones can do cocaine,
but he,

1708
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:16,370
John Jones tested positive or
lead paint out of competition.

1709
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:18,470
Right out of competition.

1710
01:42:18,950 --> 01:42:23,920
Nick Diaz tested positive for
three times in competition wells.

1711
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:24,471
The difference,

1712
01:42:24,471 --> 01:42:29,270
the problem with the last time though
was those two water tests that had him

1713
01:42:29,271 --> 01:42:30,380
below the threshold,

1714
01:42:30,381 --> 01:42:35,180
which are much more comprehensive test or
blood test and the one quest labs test,

1715
01:42:35,181 --> 01:42:37,520
which was a urine test,
had them above it.

1716
01:42:37,670 --> 01:42:40,900
So it's controversial what
happened in the last fight. Very,

1717
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:44,320
that's why he's going
to do well in that deal.

1718
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:49,370
Well that just that they're so out of
control that they would fucking banned him

1719
01:42:49,371 --> 01:42:51,140
for five years when they do that.
I mean,

1720
01:42:51,141 --> 01:42:54,770
it's one thing to find a guy or to
figure out some sort of a compromise,

1721
01:42:54,771 --> 01:42:57,200
community, service, whatever
the fuck you got to do.

1722
01:42:57,440 --> 01:43:02,440
But you're taking away the guy's career
five years when you're 20 is a long

1723
01:43:02,721 --> 01:43:06,420
time. Five years when you're
32 is a death sentence.

1724
01:43:07,810 --> 01:43:10,880
No, I agree. I agree. Well,

1725
01:43:10,881 --> 01:43:15,560
they lost their lawsuit against Vandelay
so Vandelay his suspension has been

1726
01:43:15,561 --> 01:43:18,680
lifted, right? I mean, or
if it hasn't been lifted,

1727
01:43:18,830 --> 01:43:23,810
their lifetime ban of him has been,
it's been thrown out by a judge.

1728
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:28,370
Yes. I don't know. I'm, I'm, uh, I do
know that. I know he definitely, I mean,

1729
01:43:28,371 --> 01:43:31,550
I dunno whether or not the Nevada state
athletic commission is going to appeal

1730
01:43:31,551 --> 01:43:36,210
it, but I know that they did throw out
his lifetime ban. They haven't seen,

1731
01:43:36,230 --> 01:43:40,190
they haven't licensed him. I mean, it's
not like he can go back to work right now,

1732
01:43:40,191 --> 01:43:45,170
but if they just banned him
or gave him a suspension,

1733
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:48,680
that was the same amount of time that
you would have gotten if you tested

1734
01:43:48,681 --> 01:43:53,000
positive for steroids. Especially
Vandelay had never tested positive before.

1735
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:56,210
You know, and look vandelays
nope. You know, he's no saint.

1736
01:43:56,630 --> 01:43:58,550
Who knows what the fuck he had done?
Lee's in pride,

1737
01:43:58,820 --> 01:44:01,640
but the point is when
they were testing him,

1738
01:44:01,850 --> 01:44:04,160
he followed the guidelines,

1739
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:08,810
at least in his term as far as when
they tested them and they banned him for

1740
01:44:08,811 --> 01:44:12,290
life one time he runs away from a
drug test. They ban it for life.

1741
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:15,470
That's fucking crazy.
That's crazy, right? I mean,

1742
01:44:15,471 --> 01:44:18,940
I think someone needs to pull
those guys aside and go, look,

1743
01:44:18,990 --> 01:44:22,700
it's what you do is very important.
It's very important to have you there.

1744
01:44:22,701 --> 01:44:25,700
It's very important to have a voice
of authority. It's a very important,

1745
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:29,630
important to have penalties for people
who violate the rules and cheat,

1746
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:34,760
but it's also very important to have
some common decency and some compassion.

1747
01:44:35,030 --> 01:44:38,010
You can't take a legend
like Vandelay Silva,

1748
01:44:38,011 --> 01:44:42,170
a fucking mixed martial arts legend
and banned him for life. I that's,

1749
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,900
I find that disgusting and,
and it's,

1750
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:47,720
it's bad for them because
it makes them look bad.

1751
01:44:49,370 --> 01:44:53,510
I don't disagree with you.
It's not good for PR.

1752
01:44:53,690 --> 01:44:57,350
It's not good for how everybody,
I know they were mad at me because a,

1753
01:44:57,351 --> 01:45:00,160
I tweeted the phone number for the Nevada
state athletic commission after they

1754
01:45:00,161 --> 01:45:02,990
been Nick Diaz for five years and am like,

1755
01:45:02,991 --> 01:45:05,450
let everybody know like let them
know what you think about it,

1756
01:45:05,451 --> 01:45:10,451
but you have to understand what I did to
you was nothing in compared to what you

1757
01:45:11,001 --> 01:45:14,720
did to Nick Diaz. Nothing.
Not David. Yeah, I tweeted it.

1758
01:45:15,020 --> 01:45:17,570
I was going to eat it every day for
like a year, but I changed my mind.

1759
01:45:17,830 --> 01:45:22,070
I was like, I'm not helping anybody.
No, just change her number or whatever.

1760
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:27,310
But the point being is that they didn't
take any consideration that to WIDA

1761
01:45:27,591 --> 01:45:28,280
tests,

1762
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:33,280
which is fucked up and they abandoned
for five years and find them $160,000.

1763
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:36,160
That's just crazy. Yeah.
It's too much money.

1764
01:45:36,230 --> 01:45:38,840
Chavez jr they find them 1 million bucks,
man.

1765
01:45:38,980 --> 01:45:43,100
What's it 1,000,900 and
something thousand for pot?

1766
01:45:44,490 --> 01:45:45,110
Yeah.

1767
01:45:45,110 --> 01:45:47,330
Oh my goodness. Let's see. Maybe,

1768
01:45:47,331 --> 01:45:51,320
maybe there should just be some matches
where the fighter and their opponent and

1769
01:45:51,321 --> 01:45:56,321
have to smoke pot and all of a sudden
they're doing crafts and stuff.

1770
01:45:56,690 --> 01:45:57,240
I know.

1771
01:45:57,240 --> 01:46:00,540
Crazy weed smoking dudes,
man, love your weed,

1772
01:46:00,541 --> 01:46:05,130
but don't smoke it two days before
the fight. Don't smoke it one day.

1773
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:07,650
Keep it simple. Let's, well,
let's, let's play it safe.

1774
01:46:07,651 --> 01:46:10,650
Let's go two days before the fight.
Hold the word on Nick Diaz.

1775
01:46:10,651 --> 01:46:14,880
Was that the goal me fight that he tested
so high that he had to be high when he

1776
01:46:14,881 --> 01:46:18,720
was fighting me? Yeah. Yeah.
It's crazy. It's amazing.

1777
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:24,610
It's one of those things where
like if you're in college,

1778
01:46:24,970 --> 01:46:29,970
you study for a test high that you
should take the test time and you know,

1779
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:34,690
really? Yeah. I've never heard that.
Oh yeah. It's one of those like things,

1780
01:46:34,691 --> 01:46:38,260
I mean I cannot confirm before you guys
start tweeting at me that I don't know

1781
01:46:38,261 --> 01:46:39,370
my science,
you know,

1782
01:46:39,850 --> 01:46:44,590
I'm just saying I've heard this before
and that it's sort of makes sense to me.

1783
01:46:44,980 --> 01:46:47,210
So I mean, I don't know.
Maybe if nick trains,

1784
01:46:47,290 --> 01:46:51,900
I mean I know sometimes
I go on stage. Hi. Yeah.

1785
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:56,730
And while I know what I do do is I work
out a lot of my material when I'm doing

1786
01:46:56,780 --> 01:47:01,440
a, like a late night spot at the comedy
store, I purposefully get high, you know,

1787
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:04,840
it's like working out with ankle weights
on and then you do that stuff. So Bert,

1788
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:07,590
you'll fucking slay a theater.
Oh my God,

1789
01:47:07,591 --> 01:47:10,980
your timing and beats are just impeccable
because I don't know, maybe like,

1790
01:47:11,190 --> 01:47:14,340
I don't know, maybe he trains high
so he feels like he has to fight.

1791
01:47:15,170 --> 01:47:19,220
There's been arguments like that when
it comes to testosterone replacement and

1792
01:47:19,221 --> 01:47:23,510
even though some performance enhancers
that if the two fighters had made an

1793
01:47:23,511 --> 01:47:28,370
agreement that they would both
allow the other person to do,

1794
01:47:28,430 --> 01:47:28,731
you know,

1795
01:47:28,731 --> 01:47:33,731
whatever amount of whatever that that
should be ethical on the lounge and then

1796
01:47:33,741 --> 01:47:37,220
instead of saying, you know all you're
cheating, it was just like saying,

1797
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:40,160
you allow someone to me,
we all allow people to take multivitamins,

1798
01:47:40,161 --> 01:47:44,780
we allow them to take creatine,
we allow them to use cryotherapy,

1799
01:47:44,781 --> 01:47:47,630
chambers and all these things that
have shown to have a pretty significant

1800
01:47:47,631 --> 01:47:50,970
impact on recovery. Why
not allow them, you know,

1801
01:47:51,770 --> 01:47:56,090
to make an agreement like a steel cage
match, right. If all sign up for it.

1802
01:47:56,180 --> 01:47:58,990
Yeah, I know. I'd rather
fight a stone guy than, so

1803
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:02,010
I say that you say that
you wouldn't want it.

1804
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:05,420
I'd rather do Jujitsu with a guy who is
sober. Then a guy was high. When you,

1805
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:08,970
when you get, I think I do Jujitsu
better when I'm high. I really do.

1806
01:48:08,971 --> 01:48:12,540
A lot of people do
lie to Jujitsu.

1807
01:48:12,541 --> 01:48:16,830
People do Jujitsu high, they train
high, they compete high. Super,

1808
01:48:16,831 --> 01:48:20,070
super common. The difference
is it's not striking. You know,

1809
01:48:20,610 --> 01:48:23,610
I know I'm better at eating and
watching movies when I'm high.

1810
01:48:26,150 --> 01:48:28,850
I wonder what's going to happen, Dana,
you know what you're talking about.

1811
01:48:28,851 --> 01:48:31,100
Things like this, a
doctor welling, you know,

1812
01:48:31,101 --> 01:48:35,120
coming out with this college and stuff
like when they start coming out with gene

1813
01:48:35,121 --> 01:48:38,750
therapy and all these different ways to
make your body young again and he'd get

1814
01:48:38,751 --> 01:48:42,980
a guy like v tour who is an old guy
with all this experience and all this

1815
01:48:42,981 --> 01:48:44,840
knowledge.
But you know that's,

1816
01:48:44,870 --> 01:48:47,090
that's the trade off in life
is that as you get older,

1817
01:48:47,091 --> 01:48:50,420
your body doesn't work as well.
So you might be a crafty old veteran,

1818
01:48:50,421 --> 01:48:54,260
but you got to conserve your energy more
because your body is just not capable

1819
01:48:54,261 --> 01:48:55,340
of the same kind of output.

1820
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:59,240
But if you get a guy like Vito and then
you bring them to that doctor and he

1821
01:48:59,780 --> 01:49:03,350
does some wacky shit to his body
and all of a sudden he's got both,

1822
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:07,700
he's got the knowledge and he's got the
youthful body. The whole sport gets very,

1823
01:49:07,820 --> 01:49:11,900
very different and very, very strange.
Yes. And that'll change all of sports,

1824
01:49:11,901 --> 01:49:12,710
not just fighting,

1825
01:49:12,710 --> 01:49:17,710
but the difference in basketball and MMA
is that in basketball you don't have a

1826
01:49:17,751 --> 01:49:21,680
finish like you had last night with
Holly Holm head kick and Ronda Rousey.

1827
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:25,610
You have someone's slam dunking on you.
That's like the, you know, that's the pit,

1828
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:29,480
the equivalent, you know, someone
shooting a three pointer in your face.

1829
01:49:29,570 --> 01:49:31,910
But like you said,
you have a guy who's really talented,

1830
01:49:31,911 --> 01:49:35,940
has the knowledge and how much laundry
for Jordan played, if you know, if,

1831
01:49:35,941 --> 01:49:38,110
if this what about now around
when he was here. Yeah.

1832
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:42,080
It's going to be interesting. It's
definitely gonna change the scores. It is.

1833
01:49:42,081 --> 01:49:45,470
And you got to wonder, you know, this
stuff they're doing with stem cells,

1834
01:49:45,471 --> 01:49:48,100
they're regrowing cartilage.
People that have bone on

1835
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,060
bone arthritis,

1836
01:49:49,270 --> 01:49:53,800
they inject them with stem cells and it
regrows Cartlidge it regrows meniscus

1837
01:49:53,801 --> 01:49:55,540
tissue.
It's insane.

1838
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:58,870
So all these people that have these
chronic ailments and injuries,

1839
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:03,550
they're going to be able to get those
things fixed and all the detrimental

1840
01:50:03,551 --> 01:50:05,860
effects of constant competition.

1841
01:50:06,110 --> 01:50:09,010
There is slowly but surely going to
be able to chip away at that stuff.

1842
01:50:09,170 --> 01:50:11,630
That's true. They're getting
rid of arthritis. Arthritis too.

1843
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:14,320
It's the stuff that they're doing
out there now and those injections,

1844
01:50:14,321 --> 01:50:17,960
arthritis goes away. You
know, all these, I was Regena,

1845
01:50:17,961 --> 01:50:21,650
key nation in your body that's going on.
It's uh,

1846
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:26,560
it's going to be fascinating to see how
this changes everything in the next 20

1847
01:50:26,561 --> 01:50:28,690
years. Yeah. And it's going
to be fascinating to see,

1848
01:50:28,691 --> 01:50:30,580
like what kind of regulations,
if any,

1849
01:50:30,581 --> 01:50:33,700
are they going to be able to establish
to keep up with that stuff because it's

1850
01:50:33,701 --> 01:50:36,520
way, even though, I mean, how would
you even know if a guy was doing that?

1851
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:40,720
We'll Novitsky was telling me when he
did my podcast that there's an issue that

1852
01:50:40,721 --> 01:50:42,400
they're having now with,

1853
01:50:42,550 --> 01:50:46,810
they have testosterone that they've
developed through animals instead of like

1854
01:50:46,990 --> 01:50:49,990
the way they make artificial
testosterone award. Uh,

1855
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:54,690
synthetic testosterone as they use wild
yams. I don't understand the processing,

1856
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:58,720
but they use yams.
So when they use a carbon isotope test,

1857
01:50:59,050 --> 01:51:03,600
they can tell that the testosterone
that's in your body is not indogenous.

1858
01:51:03,610 --> 01:51:07,840
It's not created by your own body, but
with this animal shit, they can't tell.

1859
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:10,800
So the testosterone they're
getting from like, I don't know,

1860
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:13,750
wild boars are what the fuck
they using for the testosterone.

1861
01:51:13,990 --> 01:51:17,050
It's the same as the testosterone.
It's being cooked up,

1862
01:51:17,051 --> 01:51:20,140
write down little Tony's nuts,
nuts.

1863
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:22,200
And what's crazy is

1864
01:51:26,870 --> 01:51:29,890
he was telling me that there's
this thing right now that you know,

1865
01:51:29,891 --> 01:51:33,220
those strips that you put on your tongue,
like a mountain, Washington, you know,

1866
01:51:34,510 --> 01:51:35,081
there's actually,

1867
01:51:35,081 --> 01:51:38,230
they have these trips that they're
putting on their tongue and uh,

1868
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:43,300
it gives you all the
effects of, uh, you know,

1869
01:51:44,350 --> 01:51:46,630
like a growth hormone or,

1870
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:49,780
or test Thomas Testosterone
injections or whatever it is,

1871
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:51,760
and it's out of your system in 12 hours.

1872
01:51:52,470 --> 01:51:55,480
If you take that before you go in to work
out and you do your whole work out and

1873
01:51:55,490 --> 01:51:55,731
everything,

1874
01:51:55,731 --> 01:51:59,230
we'd get all the benefits of it and then
it's out of your system in 12 hours.

1875
01:51:59,530 --> 01:52:03,640
That's incredible. I mean,
that's incredible. They
call not microdosing. Right?

1876
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:06,340
But it's,
these guys are there,

1877
01:52:06,430 --> 01:52:09,910
they're really playing Russian roulette
with the testing because they just

1878
01:52:09,911 --> 01:52:13,090
hoping they don't get nabbed
inside that 12 hour period.

1879
01:52:13,660 --> 01:52:15,370
That's why when the drug test show up,

1880
01:52:15,610 --> 01:52:19,320
they're showing up at your house at six
in the morning and you know, yeah, yeah.

1881
01:52:19,810 --> 01:52:23,590
It's, um, it's, it's really
interesting times because it's pretty,

1882
01:52:23,620 --> 01:52:27,870
it's been pretty clearly established that
at least the early days of the UFC and

1883
01:52:27,990 --> 01:52:30,280
the early days of pro,
well pride period,

1884
01:52:30,670 --> 01:52:33,490
there was a lot of performance enhancing
drug use. There was a lot of it,

1885
01:52:33,491 --> 01:52:34,930
you know,
off the record,

1886
01:52:34,931 --> 01:52:38,500
I've talked to guys who did it or in
pride or told me that everybody was doing

1887
01:52:38,501 --> 01:52:41,890
it and I'm on the record,
uh, NC in any way,

1888
01:52:41,891 --> 01:52:45,530
told me when he was on my podcast that
they had in the fucking contract gave him,

1889
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:49,910
it said, we will not test for
steroids in the contract. And we,

1890
01:52:50,150 --> 01:52:54,800
but we know it when we watched watch
Vandelay at 218 pounds and you see all

1891
01:52:54,801 --> 01:52:57,020
these fucking guys who
were competing over there,

1892
01:52:57,021 --> 01:52:58,610
we kind of knew they were juiced up.

1893
01:52:59,330 --> 01:53:03,230
It's going to be interesting to see
the culture of the sport transition to,

1894
01:53:03,610 --> 01:53:07,820
you know, as clean as you can get it.
And you know, you guys have to take,

1895
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:12,710
you guys have to be given credit for
that because you stepped up and you did

1896
01:53:12,711 --> 01:53:17,360
something that was very dangerous, very
dangerous for the product and it's very,

1897
01:53:17,361 --> 01:53:17,720
very,

1898
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:20,690
very dangerous for the reputation of the
sport because as more of these people

1899
01:53:20,691 --> 01:53:21,710
keep getting popped,

1900
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:25,400
like in your spending fucking billions
of dollars to do this and these guys are

1901
01:53:25,401 --> 01:53:28,430
getting popped work,
you could just do what the NFL does.

1902
01:53:28,431 --> 01:53:32,090
The NBA does kind of turn
a blind eye and you know,

1903
01:53:32,091 --> 01:53:35,450
no one's begging you to do this or
forcing you to do this. You know,

1904
01:53:35,451 --> 01:53:38,600
and I'm not sure if it's in the NFL or
major league baseball and one of them,

1905
01:53:39,080 --> 01:53:41,710
they get warned that they're
going to get tested. Yes.

1906
01:53:41,820 --> 01:53:46,370
They know that the test is coming. Um,
well that happens in college sports too.

1907
01:53:46,730 --> 01:53:48,860
I mean I've talked to guys who played
college ball and they say, hey,

1908
01:53:48,861 --> 01:53:53,360
Friday is going to be a test and
everybody's fucking drinking vinegar.

1909
01:53:53,361 --> 01:53:56,370
And you know, gallons of water and
trying to clear this year, right.

1910
01:53:56,390 --> 01:53:57,101
When you say this,

1911
01:53:57,101 --> 01:53:59,990
you know when you look at what we're
doing right now to clean the sport up,

1912
01:54:00,590 --> 01:54:04,160
you know we have contracts in place and
how many flights we have to deliver,

1913
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:05,480
not just the television,

1914
01:54:05,510 --> 01:54:09,080
the paper view and you know all these
things that we have, we have contracts,

1915
01:54:09,081 --> 01:54:10,610
we have obligations.
Yeah,

1916
01:54:10,670 --> 01:54:15,670
we're going to spend $5 million
a year and testing and testing.

1917
01:54:15,830 --> 01:54:19,910
It could completely crippled the entire
business, but it's the right thing to do.

1918
01:54:20,590 --> 01:54:23,050
It's the right thing to
do. Yeah. I don't know Def,

1919
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:24,830
I definitely don't think it's
going to cripple the business,

1920
01:54:25,010 --> 01:54:27,020
but I think it's definitely
going to figure it out.

1921
01:54:27,021 --> 01:54:31,670
If a guy gets tested and you know,
you get a big star and he's on something,

1922
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:33,193
he's gone.

1923
01:54:33,230 --> 01:54:37,550
Isn't that a big problem too with camps
is that it's not like the NFL where they

1924
01:54:37,551 --> 01:54:41,950
have this like giant infrastructure
set up for, they know like,

1925
01:54:42,350 --> 01:54:42,800
I mean there's,

1926
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:46,160
there's some variables when it comes to
strength and conditioning training when

1927
01:54:46,530 --> 01:54:48,830
in,
in in many professional sports,

1928
01:54:49,010 --> 01:54:51,500
but they have protocols that
are pretty clearly established.

1929
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:54,710
Whereas in MMA there's a bunch
of different ways to do it.

1930
01:54:54,711 --> 01:54:58,730
And this guy's a competed a very high
level that have really wacky camp

1931
01:54:58,731 --> 01:55:00,650
environments. We like, you know,

1932
01:55:00,651 --> 01:55:03,110
this is not really the most
professional they're hanging out with.

1933
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:06,860
Like that fucking guy that Anderson hangs
around with the guy from black houses,

1934
01:55:06,890 --> 01:55:10,250
60 year old guy who looks like Arnold
Schwarzenegger. You know what I mean?

1935
01:55:10,670 --> 01:55:12,710
I mean like, what do you
think that guy does? Oh,

1936
01:55:12,711 --> 01:55:17,510
nothing is fucking fruits and vegetables.
Steak and chicken. I mean, come on man,

1937
01:55:17,770 --> 01:55:21,500
I'm fucked. You guys choose to the
tits and, and no wonder, you know,

1938
01:55:21,501 --> 01:55:24,350
Anderson tested positive other than
the way he's hanging out with that guy.

1939
01:55:24,630 --> 01:55:29,020
Why would that guy tell him
the, the positive benefits
of steroids? You know, it's,

1940
01:55:29,021 --> 01:55:32,960
it's weird. It's weird and you
know, this sport is so big,

1941
01:55:32,961 --> 01:55:37,730
but has that aspect of it still
that there's, there's, you know,

1942
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:40,670
it's not, it's not universe,
not across the board.

1943
01:55:40,820 --> 01:55:44,490
Like look at Kansas City royals
and the Los Angeles Dodgers.

1944
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:46,890
How much fucking difference
is their training?

1945
01:55:46,891 --> 01:55:48,330
How much difference is there preparation?

1946
01:55:48,690 --> 01:55:53,690
I would say probably not nearly as much
as comparing someone who trains at Nova

1947
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:58,380
Uniao or so on trains at AMC pankration
you know, I mean the variables and MMA,

1948
01:55:58,381 --> 01:55:59,760
they're pretty,
pretty stark.

1949
01:56:01,010 --> 01:56:05,900
Yeah, that's true. Um, and working now,

1950
01:56:07,110 --> 01:56:11,180
the training has to evolve. You
know, we're building this new campus,

1951
01:56:11,610 --> 01:56:14,870
basically building new offices and uh,

1952
01:56:15,680 --> 01:56:20,680
building a state of the art rehabilitation
center fighters and it's like the New

1953
01:56:23,120 --> 01:56:26,990
England patriots, right? If something
happens to Brady, they don't tell Brady,

1954
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:28,760
see you later and come back,
go,

1955
01:56:28,761 --> 01:56:31,760
go do your surgery and all your stuff
and come back and let us know when you're

1956
01:56:31,761 --> 01:56:34,670
ready to play again. He's, they're there,

1957
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:37,640
they're there making sure he's
doing therapy. He's got the best.

1958
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:40,880
That's what we're going to start
doing it with the fighters and Vegas.

1959
01:56:41,870 --> 01:56:44,810
And how do you set something like that up?
Like who do you have running?

1960
01:56:45,110 --> 01:56:50,000
So we're actually taking a looking
at companies right now to come in,

1961
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:51,860
you know,
we're going to find the best of the best.

1962
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:55,530
This will literally be a state of the art.
Um,

1963
01:56:56,690 --> 01:56:59,810
the best in the World Rehab facility.
It's going to be insane.

1964
01:57:00,330 --> 01:57:03,500
And now we're going to have everything
of everything in there to Rehab.

1965
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:05,560
We're going to have the, the, the, um,

1966
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:09,910
therapist and trainers in there
to show people how to, you know,

1967
01:57:09,980 --> 01:57:11,180
how to get a lot of these guys.

1968
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:16,460
A lot of these guys will go get an ACL
done and then not do the therapy when

1969
01:57:16,851 --> 01:57:20,180
they come back. And, and you might
as well not have to fucking surgery.

1970
01:57:20,690 --> 01:57:24,140
You have to go through the
physical therapy to get it
back and then you have to

1971
01:57:24,141 --> 01:57:27,230
keep working on that way, you know? Um,

1972
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:32,710
and Conor Mcgregor,
that's what's so another fascinating,

1973
01:57:32,870 --> 01:57:36,650
his whole thing about movement,
human movement and flexibility and stuff.

1974
01:57:36,860 --> 01:57:41,430
He's very into that. He, you know, he
fought the Chad Mendez fight with them,

1975
01:57:41,910 --> 01:57:45,960
with really blown out knee,
um, to, what did he do for,

1976
01:57:45,961 --> 01:57:48,590
we did he get a stem cell shots?

1977
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:53,600
So he went out to Germany and
got those shots and uh, Germany,

1978
01:57:54,050 --> 01:57:55,970
he went to Germany and in Ireland,

1979
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,990
so he just went over to Germany
and got those shots. And uh,

1980
01:58:00,290 --> 01:58:04,700
he did some in California too. He did do
some in La too when he was out in Vegas.

1981
01:58:05,330 --> 01:58:08,420
Um, and that's all you
needed. You did that.

1982
01:58:08,421 --> 01:58:12,290
And he did his own physical therapy and
he brought the knee right back. Well,

1983
01:58:12,291 --> 01:58:13,070
that's what's incredible

1984
01:58:13,070 --> 01:58:16,040
credible about the stem cells
shed man to the regenerative,

1985
01:58:16,280 --> 01:58:21,110
regenerative potential for
stem cells is just incredible.

1986
01:58:21,111 --> 01:58:23,360
And they're just now
starting to tap into that.

1987
01:58:23,361 --> 01:58:28,100
And when it comes to sports
and rehabilitation, when
you're establishing this,

1988
01:58:28,190 --> 01:58:31,210
this place has this whole center, um, are,

1989
01:58:31,310 --> 01:58:34,810
are you going to establish like
strength and conditioning protocols to,

1990
01:58:34,811 --> 01:58:37,310
are you going to bring people in
for that kind of stuff as well?

1991
01:58:37,311 --> 01:58:42,010
Like and like movement specific,
like different guys who have Organon

1992
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,280
certain things, different guys
who are grapplers were gone.

1993
01:58:44,290 --> 01:58:47,410
Certain things I don't dig where to
get into the striking and grappling.

1994
01:58:48,190 --> 01:58:49,750
That's not our area.
That's not our thing.

1995
01:58:50,410 --> 01:58:52,540
They can pick their own coaches
and who they'll work with them.

1996
01:58:52,541 --> 01:58:56,320
But I mean as far as like improved like
strength and conditioning aspects of

1997
01:58:56,321 --> 01:59:01,120
that body balanced, you know, proper
strength conditioning, stretch,

1998
01:59:01,150 --> 01:59:03,340
you know,
all the things that that um,

1999
01:59:04,300 --> 01:59:08,230
they're definitely not learning
at their jumps so much to learn.

2000
01:59:08,580 --> 01:59:09,420
You know what I mean?
You know,

2001
01:59:09,430 --> 01:59:12,010
there's a lot of coaches like
Edmond is a good example.

2002
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:15,450
He's obviously good at holding
mitts and good at teaching. Rhonda,

2003
01:59:15,470 --> 01:59:17,140
the mechanics of throwing punches.

2004
01:59:17,410 --> 01:59:19,480
How much does he know
about defending gay teens?

2005
01:59:19,690 --> 01:59:23,260
How much does he know about the
transitions between boxing and grappling?

2006
01:59:23,530 --> 01:59:25,330
And we don't, you know,
we really don't know.

2007
01:59:25,630 --> 01:59:30,630
And I think the same can be said as far
as what are the requirements of your

2008
01:59:31,001 --> 01:59:32,710
sport when it comes to
strength and conditioning.

2009
01:59:32,950 --> 01:59:36,910
It's still kind of being
learned and everybody does
things differently for every

2010
01:59:36,911 --> 01:59:40,030
guy. Like GSP and thinks
you have to use gymnastics.

2011
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:44,410
There's certain guys like fate or gave
up on all weights in any strength and

2012
01:59:44,411 --> 01:59:47,830
conditioning later in his career and
just did fight training. You know,

2013
01:59:47,831 --> 01:59:51,130
you look at John Jones right now who's
totally getting into all this power

2014
01:59:51,131 --> 01:59:55,240
lifting stuff. Um, have you seen some
of that stuff? Oh my God, he looks huge.

2015
01:59:55,270 --> 02:00:00,130
It's unbelievable. Shrek a freak of
nature. That guy is, he really is.

2016
02:00:00,580 --> 02:00:04,090
I'm hoping he straightened his head
out and comes back because when you,

2017
02:00:04,091 --> 02:00:07,270
when you want to talk about
just a spectacular talent,

2018
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:11,260
I mean Jon Jones is probably
the most talented guy we've
ever seen in this sport.

2019
02:00:12,130 --> 02:00:13,070
I mean it is,
is,

2020
02:00:14,650 --> 02:00:18,400
he's just an incredible athlete and
what he's been able to do to top level

2021
02:00:18,401 --> 02:00:22,450
fighters like really early on in his
career is nothing short of amazing.

2022
02:00:22,450 --> 02:00:27,450
If he has a wake up call from all this
and just cuts the bullshit and focuses on

2023
02:00:29,080 --> 02:00:33,700
just, just taking advantage of
the prime cause he's in his prime,

2024
02:00:33,701 --> 02:00:37,810
he's in his prime, he's in his
prime. He's so big, so talented.

2025
02:00:38,530 --> 02:00:41,440
Such a gifted athlete. I mean,
you look at, like you said,

2026
02:00:41,441 --> 02:00:45,580
what he's done in the Fed and the sport.
Then you look at what he's doing now,

2027
02:00:45,590 --> 02:00:50,300
he just gets into power lifting and he's
benching 500 pounds and squat and dead

2028
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:53,290
lift and 600 pounds. I mean, it's
crazy. And he could fight it.

2029
02:00:53,291 --> 02:00:56,700
Fucking heavyweight too, by the
way. Easy. He keeps powerlifting.

2030
02:00:56,710 --> 02:01:01,180
He's probably gonna have
to, I know, right? Yeah, but
it's just, it's, it's cool.

2031
02:01:01,181 --> 02:01:04,960
It looks like, it looks like he
is, he's doing the right thing now.

2032
02:01:04,961 --> 02:01:09,040
He's doing what he's supposed to
be doing for his community service.

2033
02:01:09,160 --> 02:01:12,450
It looks like he's working
hard in the gym, you know? Um,

2034
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,040
it looks like his heads into it
and he likes it. And you know,

2035
02:01:15,041 --> 02:01:17,620
we were talking about
inspiration. Look, he's,

2036
02:01:17,710 --> 02:01:21,220
he's in camp now with the fucking
woman's bantamweight champ of the world.

2037
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:24,190
Holly Holm is definitely going to give
Johnson inspiration because I know

2038
02:01:24,191 --> 02:01:28,520
they're close friends. Yeah. That's
cool. It's fucking awesome. I said,

2039
02:01:28,530 --> 02:01:33,310
I think we gave these people enough
and this bitch podcast on a plane. Oh,

2040
02:01:33,311 --> 02:01:38,220
we look at this. We did another hour
and 27 minutes. Shizam Holy Shit.

2041
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:42,380
That two hours. Yeah. See Time
flies when we talked Dana White.

2042
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:47,690
Good Lord. It's going to be the
first podcast you have to be on TV.

2043
02:01:47,691 --> 02:01:52,210
The one, one of those two, like I
said, changing the game. All right,

2044
02:01:52,220 --> 02:01:56,150
well this is the end of this. Thanks
brother. Appreciate it. Tony Hinchcliffe.

2045
02:01:56,151 --> 02:02:00,350
Say Goodbye to the people. Good by
people. Tony. Tony in each color.

2046
02:02:00,351 --> 02:02:04,280
One hour special. One shot coming soon.
My first special that might be on Netflix.

2047
02:02:04,281 --> 02:02:09,020
I mean that's what I heard. Uh, might
be, um, any more message to the fan.

2048
02:02:09,021 --> 02:02:12,800
Any word? Nothing. Anything
you want to say? Thanks. It
was, it was a historic night,

2049
02:02:13,330 --> 02:02:18,110
you know, uh, Rhonda Rousey versus Holly
Holm broke every record UFC ever had.

2050
02:02:18,111 --> 02:02:20,160
And thank you everybody.
We appreciate it.

2051
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:24,560
Attendance pay per view buys everything.
Attendance.

2052
02:02:24,890 --> 02:02:29,710
The Eddie had a gross
record. Gate record. Um,

2053
02:02:29,780 --> 02:02:34,760
the, uh, the merge, the,
the commercial paper view.

2054
02:02:35,180 --> 02:02:39,500
Um, the paper views trending
well over a million buys. Um,

2055
02:02:40,550 --> 02:02:42,050
what else? I'm trying to think. I just,

2056
02:02:42,051 --> 02:02:45,470
there were so many records that were
broken that night. It was crazy.

2057
02:02:45,530 --> 02:02:48,230
Now here's the last question.
If you do do a rematch,

2058
02:02:48,440 --> 02:02:53,010
when do you think you would do, which
tried to do it for UFC 200 in July? Um,

2059
02:02:53,750 --> 02:02:55,580
I don't know. I, again, we got to see,

2060
02:02:55,960 --> 02:02:59,090
we've got to see where Ron does
that figured out. Yeah, I mean,

2061
02:02:59,091 --> 02:03:03,050
obviously that's like UFC 200 would be
awesome. That would be the move. Right?

2062
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:05,290
Great. All right folks, that's it.

2063
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:08,980
That's the end. Thank you. And Goodbye.

2064
02:03:13,790 --> 02:03:16,310
Oh, you still here? Well, if you are,

2065
02:03:16,700 --> 02:03:21,700
please enjoy the lovely sounds of Dana
White's snoring on the flight home from

2066
02:03:22,551 --> 02:03:23,240
Australia.
