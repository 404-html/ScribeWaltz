1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,860
Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:08,190
So it was one of the great challenges in
life is knowing enough to think you're

3
00:00:10,841 --> 00:00:11,674
right,

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,430
but not enough to know you're wrong.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,810
Uh,

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,441
yeah.

7
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:18,840
Well that is a big problem with a lot of
people that watch these youtube videos.

8
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:19,590
That's what it is.

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,921
They say,

10
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:20,131
oh,

11
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:20,701
this is right.

12
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:21,211
Oh my gosh.

13
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:23,280
But they don't know enough
to know why it's wrong,

14
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:24,390
but this is what I wanted
to talk to you about.

15
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:24,481
Uh,

16
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:26,940
what is it about people that there's this,

17
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:27,410
this,

18
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:27,720
this,

19
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,720
this very compelling need
to find something out that
other people don't know.

20
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:34,860
Like the world is flat,

21
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,570
like dinosaurs aren't real.

22
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,540
Like that kind of stuff is
very compelling to people.

23
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,220
So what I do in those cases,

24
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:41,431
in the,

25
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:42,264
in the,

26
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:42,840
uh,

27
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,140
yeah,

28
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,140
so what I do is I would say instead of
debating them and some of some of your

29
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,910
listeners are listening to this right now,

30
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,590
it's what all I would do is say,

31
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,160
what is your best single bit of
evidence for what you're claiming

32
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,300
and what would it take to
show that you're wrong?

33
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,483
All right,

34
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,580
well let's go get a simple one.

35
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:08,731
So,

36
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:08,971
so,

37
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:13,971
so that's what I would ask and I've
done this exercise and it doesn't work.

38
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,880
You know why?

39
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,270
Why?

40
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,250
Because there was a guy who didn't
believe we went to the moon.

41
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,710
We spent a third of our
time in our last session,

42
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:20,460
goes into there.

43
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,150
So there's someone I know who doesn't
believe he went to the moon rather than

44
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:25,170
just say he's skeptical.

45
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,400
So I said,

46
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,500
what kind of evidence would convince you?

47
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,350
He said images of the landing
site of the Apollo missions.

48
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,311
So I said,

49
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:36,144
okay,

50
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,680
here's a website where we sent a,

51
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,281
if I wasn't west,

52
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:40,921
it was the Chinese.

53
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:45,210
I think Chinese or Europeans
sent aced a probe to an orbiter,

54
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,020
to the moon.

55
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,350
So it was close enough because
ground based telescopes are not,

56
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,610
don't.

57
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,350
They don't have the resolution
to see the landing sites.

58
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,590
But via close enough to
the moon you can the.

59
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,850
It photographed the entire
surface of the moon.

60
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,030
And there were the landing sites and you
saw the rover tracks and the base for

61
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:03,630
the lunar module.

62
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,040
And so he,

63
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,190
that night he went home and found
it and then he came back and says,

64
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,630
well,

65
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,770
NASA could have faked that.

66
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,940
Well,

67
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,773
I'm done with you.

68
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,840
We have no more to talk about because
he's not ready to be convinced.

69
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,541
Well,

70
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:19,081
that's a weird.

71
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:23,640
Because he gave him the evidence he
asked for exactly that would convince him

72
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,170
and it did not convince them.

73
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,300
And the other thing that's going on here,

74
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:29,200
which is still a theory I'm working on,

75
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,080
but there seems to be a disturbing peek
at what a matriarchy would be like.

76
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,560
And I'm seeing a lot of women in these
movements who are sort of vindictive and

77
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,513
cruel.

78
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,650
And like this woman we're talking about,

79
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:43,980
uh,

80
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,281
you know,

81
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:45,570
you watch these videos and you hear like,

82
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,770
fuck 'em up these women's
voices from behind the crowd.

83
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:51,180
And I called them shit chest.

84
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,340
Let's that woman from the
University of Missouri.

85
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,750
Can I get some muscle over here?

86
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,600
Remember her?

87
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:55,731
Yeah,

88
00:02:55,731 --> 00:02:55,871
yeah,

89
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:56,110
yeah,

90
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,730
yeah.

91
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,590
She wants men to fight on her behalf.

92
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,590
And you know,

93
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,360
Ironman has that blue thing in his chest.

94
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,370
I don't think women are evil.

95
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:05,230
I like our women are
like ironman there magic,

96
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:05,800
right,

97
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,720
but by ripping out that blue thing,

98
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,350
you're ripping up the ability to have
children and be mothers and everything,

99
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,650
and then you put in a piece
of shit into iron man's chest.

100
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,930
That's what feminist and
like this woman are there.

101
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:17,764
Shit chests.

102
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,070
They're malfunctioning
robots and they're like,

103
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,490
this kill him.

104
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,510
Milo wants genocide killing.

105
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,230
So do you think that they're imitating
what they think are patriarchal

106
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:29,861
societies?

107
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:33,010
They're doing their version of it and
that's what they're doing with this.

108
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,410
The whole matriarchal posturing.

109
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:35,591
Yeah.

110
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:36,520
It's like Clark Kent,

111
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,870
I want to run an article.

112
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,680
I'm writing.

113
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:39,970
No,

114
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,320
you're not running a clerk.

115
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,300
Simmer down,

116
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:43,840
dude.

117
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,830
You write your article.

118
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:45,610
I'm doing mine.

119
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,443
No.

120
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,260
Can he crunches up?

121
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,260
There's not a whole lot of matriarchal
societies in the animal world other than

122
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:54,094
hyenas.

123
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:54,700
I try.

124
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,060
There's a few of them is a few where
the females are larger than the males.

125
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,370
A few bugs especially,

126
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,410
but hyenas in particular,

127
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:04,510
the female hyenas are much
larger than the males.

128
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,350
They even have fake Dick's penis.

129
00:04:07,351 --> 00:04:10,150
He has this big large tube
fake Dick that hangs down.

130
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:13,990
They actually give birth out of it and
they climb on top of the males and they

131
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:15,580
fucked him and the speculation,

132
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:15,790
what?

133
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,280
There's a lot of speculation as
to why the females are bigger,

134
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:23,200
but one of them is that they think that
she has to be bigger because Nina's are

135
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:24,070
so god damn ruthless.

136
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:24,940
They eat their babies.

137
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,080
Oh.

138
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:29,590
So the female has to go get the fuck
away from the booby good to when she gets

139
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:30,640
on top of books.

140
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:30,900
Um,

141
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,130
you piece of shit did.

142
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,240
It's my baby.

143
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,260
I mean there's no more,

144
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:35,920
you know,

145
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,880
no pun intended,

146
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,490
dog eat dog world than
a fucking Hyena world.

147
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,320
You're out there fighting
for scraps with lions.

148
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:42,910
Yeah.

149
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,250
Well,

150
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,140
I actually have described Antifa and
these people as hygienists because that

151
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:49,630
thing I was talking about at Berkeley
where there are guys went in and said,

152
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:51,160
I thought you guys were
tough or something,

153
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:53,410
was his exact quote and
they're going to get him,

154
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:53,801
get him,

155
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:54,634
fuck him up.

156
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,830
And then the guys sort of give up
because no one wants to fight them.

157
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,260
They start walking away and
then someone runs up behind him,

158
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,970
knocks him out with a flag pole as they're
screaming easy Italian slogans by the

159
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:04,070
way,

160
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,450
like,

161
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:04,890
no,

162
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,950
she's thought the flashy stuff
from the 19 twenties having fun.

163
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,290
They knock yet game.

164
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,510
They're larping and then knocked him out
and then as soon as he's out that the

165
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,710
hyenas come out and then
they start kicking his
unconscious body and they start

166
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:18,341
grabbing.

167
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:19,570
They're really little.

168
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:19,740
It's,

169
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:19,930
yeah,

170
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,441
it's online.

171
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:21,110
You can find.

172
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,470
I have people that I talked to,

173
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,400
professionals,

174
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,391
um,

175
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:29,260
obviously like sports psychologists
or sports psychologist.

176
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:32,260
And then you got to get a psychologist
in general to deal with the depression,

177
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,041
whatever.

178
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:33,990
When you hit your lows,

179
00:05:33,991 --> 00:05:35,560
like it's okay to,

180
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,340
to get,

181
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:36,641
you know,

182
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:38,800
if you're bench pressing 350 pounds,

183
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,600
it's okay to have a little touch.

184
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,280
It's okay to have a little
spot here and there,

185
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:43,110
you know,

186
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,920
and then after you get a couple of spots,

187
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,930
now after a while you can do it yourself.

188
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:48,100
You don't need the spot anymore.

189
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,890
That's how I look at
psychiatric help to an extent.

190
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:51,521
For some people,

191
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:52,990
especially if they're battling depression.

192
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,100
Sometimes you just need
a floaty and you did,

193
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,130
and then you can take the
floaties off after a year.

194
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,090
You

195
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:58,731
see what I'm saying?

196
00:05:58,731 --> 00:05:59,660
It's a mental,

197
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,000
it's a mental floaty and it's okay because
we all hit low part low points in our

198
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:08,990
life where it's unbearable and you either
allow it to continue to be unbearable

199
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:11,780
and just deny it or you deal
with the task at hand and say,

200
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:12,860
I'm a little low right now.

201
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:13,651
I need the floaties.

202
00:06:13,651 --> 00:06:14,484
It's okay.

203
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,560
I'll get through this,

204
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,150
and then when you take the photos off,

205
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:20,240
you realize I only needed them for a
little bit of time and now I'm okay.

206
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:21,074
I'm here,

207
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,610
and that's kind of what it felt like.

208
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:24,740
It's like I just needed
a little bit of a push.

209
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:28,190
I needed to get through this and
learn some things about my own,

210
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,680
my own mind and understand my own emotions
and understand that I didn't need all

211
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:35,570
these things that I was
thinking where it real.

212
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,060
It was me not being in
control of my own emotions,

213
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:42,170
your own emotions or your choice
and I chose to feel trapped.

214
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:43,250
I chose to be sad.

215
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:45,440
I chose to feel like I was Jack Shit.

216
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:49,160
I chose all these things and it's like
you don't need fighting to be these

217
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:49,371
things.

218
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:50,204
You need to.

219
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,270
You need to let go of fighting to learn
that you are something without it,

220
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,640
and that was actually a gift.

221
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,890
It became a gift because I learned so
much in life now bigger than fighting.

222
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,510
I look at the things that I went through
as a gift because I have gotten the

223
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:06,470
gift of feeling

224
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,730
retired during my career.

225
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,220
Who else gets that?

226
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,030
Some people retire for five years,

227
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:18,170
lose their freaking mind,

228
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,410
end up in the bar and come back and try
to fight again 10 years later with a

229
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:22,244
weakened body,

230
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,190
a mess or abuse.

231
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,890
Why?

232
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,723
Why though?

233
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,810
Why are they doing that?

234
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:28,790
They're not doing it because
they're physically capable.

235
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,700
They're doing it because they never
dealt with their life away from fighting.

236
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,890
Fighting was there like
fighting is who they are.

237
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:35,060
Fighting is their persona,

238
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,890
so take away fighting.

239
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,933
What are they?

240
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,250
They're in the bar drinking away with.

241
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,084
They're not.

242
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:42,920
Instead of drinking,

243
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,920
putting the booze down and knowing
what you are without fighting,

244
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,580
being happy with that chapter of your
life and being able to live who you are.

245
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:53,930
I've gotten to feel that and now
I can fight with a peace of mind,

246
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:58,340
knowing how good I am without fighting
and how great I am with it too.

247
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,860
And um,

248
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,083
that's,

249
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,950
that's what this thing's about.

250
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,421
All these fights,

251
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:08,720
all these me attacking those challenges
coming back and winning and getting my

252
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:09,554
belt back.

253
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,903
Um,

254
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,780
that could only happen because I let
go of control of the things I couldn't

255
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:15,350
control.

256
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,591
Okay?

257
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:16,040
But here's,

258
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,340
here's part of the problem when you're
talking about people who troll online,

259
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,240
go back to when you were a young liberal
and you thought that if I was a doctor

260
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:25,070
and I was making $3 million a year course,

261
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,050
I should be given 70 percent in taxes.

262
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,970
You don't have that.

263
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,080
So you're looking at the people
who do in this part of you is like,

264
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:32,721
give it away,

265
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:33,261
man.

266
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:33,741
You shouldn't do.

267
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:34,670
You don't deserve it.

268
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:35,504
Give it away.

269
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,240
That same mentality exists with trolls.

270
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,220
They don't have anything going on.

271
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,380
They're fucking losers for the most part,

272
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:43,214
so what do they want to do?

273
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,900
They want to burn it all down.

274
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,580
They want the whole thing burned down.

275
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,840
Go trump,

276
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,010
go try.

277
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,990
The reason why they want to say go
trump is because they want this clearly

278
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:58,530
maniacal person to just throw a fucking
monkey wrench into the gears and watched

279
00:08:58,531 --> 00:08:59,790
the whole system explode.

280
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,500
That's half of what they're doing.

281
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,360
They don't have a vested interest in it.

282
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,140
They're not.

283
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,910
They're not successful.

284
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,020
They're not happy.

285
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,190
They're not doing well.

286
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,310
I think their roles,

287
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,650
if you're talking about
all trump supporters,

288
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:11,970
I think part of that is true.

289
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:12,860
I'm not talking about all.

290
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,171
Okay,

291
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:13,390
okay.

292
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,090
Because I was talking
about all trump supporters.

293
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:16,110
I'm talking about trolls.

294
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,710
Those people with the green frog fucking
with the crazy hair on their twitter

295
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:20,544
profile.

296
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,730
There's a lot of them that have
you go over their twitter feed,

297
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,700
their online,

298
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,980
13 hours a day,

299
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,180
shitting on people.

300
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:27,900
I mean,

301
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,910
that's what some people do.

302
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,781
I've gone.

303
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:31,591
I looked at this,

304
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:34,310
a few people that I follow and
I don't follow them either.

305
00:09:34,311 --> 00:09:35,410
I just go to their page,

306
00:09:35,411 --> 00:09:37,740
I have them bookmarked and
I'll go to their page like,

307
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:38,980
look at this crazy asshole.

308
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,070
What's he been up to today
and what have they been up to?

309
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,110
Just trolling liberals.

310
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,150
Just going crazy and shitting on that.

311
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:45,901
Jake tapper.

312
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:50,520
Guy Boyd is fucking guy's
twitter feed is a mess.

313
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,660
Why?

314
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,860
Because he,

315
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,440
he fucking summoned the ire of the trolls.
