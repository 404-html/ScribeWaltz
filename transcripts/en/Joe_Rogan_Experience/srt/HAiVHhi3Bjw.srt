1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
Turn this up a little bit.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,310
Just the daycare.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:05,460
We're up,

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,210
we're live.

5
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,043
We're taking,

6
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,943
goddammit.

7
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,330
You good Tom Rhodes,

8
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:10,164
everything groovy over there.

9
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,920
Indeed sir.

10
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,470
This episode is brought to you by tea.

11
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,650
There's no ting.

12
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,540
I don't need a thing.

13
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,110
Audible.

14
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:16,770
Yes.

15
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,770
Audible episode is brought to you by
audible.com if you go to audible.com

16
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:23,610
forward slash Joe,

17
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,060
you will get free 30 days use of
audible.com and a a free audio book.

18
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,530
audible.com is one of the
best resources online.

19
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:39,090
I would say like the best as far
as audio content for commuting,

20
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:40,770
for going to the gym for,

21
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:41,000
you know,

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,680
whatever you have to do.

23
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,490
Are you sitting there?

24
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,070
It's normally just wasted time.

25
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:46,650
You can have a good time with
an audio book and you know,

26
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:49,770
it's a bad ass audio book when you park
your car and you're sitting in there

27
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:51,000
cause you don't want it to end.

28
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,990
And that's the difference between a
regular commute and a commute when you're

29
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:56,100
listening to something cool.

30
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,323
Um,

31
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,310
in some people say like,

32
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,910
well that's what we use your podcast for.

33
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,631
Well thank you.

34
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:01,860
I'm glad if that's the case.

35
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:02,911
Thank you very much.

36
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:03,744
I'm glad you enjoy it,

37
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,110
but sometimes you probably don't want
to listen to me anymore and I feel the

38
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:07,560
same way.

39
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,610
I don't want to listen to me anymore.

40
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,260
I don't listen to this fucking podcast.

41
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,520
Sometimes you gotta mix it up.

42
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:14,100
You want some Joe Rogan some Steinbeck.

43
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,740
Mixing it up is important
in this fucking life.

44
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,151
Don't mix me up.

45
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:18,984
It's time back though.

46
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,410
I just,

47
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,970
I just don't feel it's a fair comparison.

48
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,863
It's not the same heart.

49
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:22,700
Um,

50
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,461
I bet Steinbeck.

51
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:24,960
We have a boring fucking podcast.

52
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:25,794
How about that?

53
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,670
I fucking said it,

54
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,261
Tom Ross.

55
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:29,640
I don't give a fuck dude.

56
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,280
I'm gangster when I'm
talking about dead dudes.

57
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,583
Uh,

58
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,610
uh,

59
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,071
but anyway,

60
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:36,750
if you go to audible.com
forward slash Joe,

61
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:40,500
you get a free audio book is hundreds
of thousands of titles there.

62
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,240
You can also get podcasts,

63
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,780
including the brilliant Dan
Carlin hardcore history.

64
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,150
Just like one of my favorite
podcasts of all time.

65
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:51,540
I've learned more about history from
Dan Carlin than I ever did in my three

66
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,310
years of barely paying attention college.

67
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,170
And all the time that
I was in high school,

68
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,750
this one dude and his crazy fucking
podcast and you can get all of his back

69
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:00,250
order,

70
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:00,570
uh,

71
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,403
his episodes,

72
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,011
they're brilliant.

73
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:02,370
They're like,

74
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:02,551
they're,

75
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:03,330
they're like,

76
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,680
it's not just like a podcast.

77
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:06,000
It's like a show,

78
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,790
like he puts on a historical show.

79
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,930
It's so dramatic.

80
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:11,280
It's fucking fantastic.

81
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:11,551
I can't,

82
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:13,110
I literally can't recommend it enough.

83
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:13,920
Um,

84
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,920
but that's also available on audible.com
or also brought to you by hover.

85
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,000
Hover is the same company or it's rather
is owned by the same people that own

86
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:24,810
ting.

87
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,810
And a hover is a really easy intuitive
website to purchase web domains and they

88
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:34,230
may get super easy.

89
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:36,450
I've purchased domains
from them personally.

90
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,320
Um,

91
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,920
they,

92
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,890
they have free things that
other people make you pay for.

93
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,590
Like who is domain name privacy,

94
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,341
uh,

95
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:45,210
which is like,

96
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,610
it's a real pain in the ass if you,

97
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:47,880
uh,

98
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,880
if you're a freak and you get some weird
shit out there online and you know,

99
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,030
people know about it.

100
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,830
It was just something back in the day,

101
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,580
there was a time Tom Rhodes where if you
had party in your mouth.com and you put

102
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:01,414
that up online,

103
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,510
people would go after you
Dick Party in your mouth.

104
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:04,811
It's just,

105
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,090
I'm just saying if that was your thing,

106
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,370
somebody just snatching up
that donate domain right now.

107
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,531
We already did it.

108
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:12,364
We already have.

109
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,260
If you go to hover.com forward slash
Rogan you get 10% off your domain name

110
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:18,094
registrations.

111
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,581
Again,

112
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:19,660
it's super intuitive,

113
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:20,261
very easy.

114
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:22,990
I am not tech savvy by any
stretch of the imagination,

115
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,480
so if I can go there and
do it without a hitch,

116
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,970
you can too.

117
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,720
Go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash
rogue and get 10% off your domain name

118
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,190
registrations on.

119
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,450
We also have already shift fears,

120
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:36,040
legs.com uh,

121
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,491
yes,

122
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:37,120
that's right.

123
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,900
There's a bunch of a different silly
sites that Brian has registered while the

124
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:41,950
show's been going on,

125
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,380
including dig party in your mouth.com.

126
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,813
Yeah.

127
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,300
And uh,

128
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,200
what was the other one?

129
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,360
We haven't really gay one that works
like Tom Sports or something like,

130
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,950
I don't even remember what
age it just squirt burt.com.

131
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,900
It just took you to death squad
to get a desk water squirt.

132
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:01,750
Bert has a special surprise
that I can't show on,

133
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,610
uh,

134
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:02,891
on the,

135
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:03,800
on the Ustream.

136
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,690
They'll kick us off.

137
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,830
We're also brought to you by [inaudible]
dot com if you've heard about on it

138
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,420
before you probably
heard about supplements.

139
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,170
Uh,

140
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,350
but there's other things besides
like protein things we sell,

141
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:15,550
including fitness equipment,

142
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,960
all like the,

143
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,980
in my opinion,

144
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:21,940
the best stuff for developing functional
strength and staying fit and just

145
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:22,991
making sure that,

146
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:23,201
you know,

147
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:25,930
just put in the work and make
sure that your body functions.

148
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,930
It's not saying you have to be a
bodybuilder or a super athlete,

149
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:30,190
but I swear to you,

150
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,290
have you just put in some work,

151
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,360
couple of days a week
to three days a week,

152
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:39,220
just exert yourself and you don't
necessarily have to have a trainer.

153
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,180
You can do it yourself.

154
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,140
Um,

155
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,430
I think you should learn PR good form
whenever you lifting weights or doing

156
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:47,320
anything with kettle bells
or anything where it's like,

157
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:47,861
you know,

158
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:48,790
you could hurt yourself,

159
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,730
but it was as long as you learn
good form and use discipline,

160
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,290
you could just follow DVDs.

161
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,200
We have two available on
at.com from Keith Webber,

162
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,050
these extreme kettlebell
cardio workout DVDs.

163
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,530
You don't need fucking anything else then
those DVDs for the rest of your life,

164
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,610
they will crush you.

165
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,151
Those,

166
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:07,950
those DVDs are amazing and you can do
them with like a single 35 pound kettle

167
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:08,560
bell,

168
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,920
including the primate bells that we
saw it on it that looked like angry

169
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:12,701
chimpanzees.

170
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:13,870
They're fucking bad ass.

171
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,033
Um,

172
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,851
besides that,

173
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:17,860
there's protein supplements,

174
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,960
cognitive enhancing supplements,

175
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,950
and during supplements,

176
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:21,820
all kinds of cool shit.

177
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,170
You probably heard this all
before me talking about it,

178
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,360
but there's nothing I can do.

179
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:27,070
Ladies and gentlemen,

180
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,660
I must continue talking about it in
the same boring manner as before.

181
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:32,740
However,

182
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,640
we're almost there.

183
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,290
I see the light at the end of the tunnel.

184
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,020
Go buy some buffalo jerky
son gets a freak on,

185
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,690
get some hemp force protein powder.

186
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,440
And if you use a code name Brogue and
you save 10% off any and all supplements.

187
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:44,921
All right,

188
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:45,410
that's it.

189
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,170
God dammit.

190
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,950
I think Brian and he cakes coming up.

191

Yeah.

195
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:54,430

Love to do the show.

199
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,100
This is how we roll.

200
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,530
Ladies and gentlemen put
together shows on the air.

201
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,341
So that's it.

202
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:02,174
Friday night,

203
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,340

204
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:03,980

207
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:08,450

All free for all.

212
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,210
Like basically all the dudes we hang
out with her was Tony Hinchcliffe for

213
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:21,070
Thompson girl.

214
00:06:21,071 --> 00:06:22,010
Like anything that comes up,

215
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:22,830
we have it there.

216
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,400
All right.

217
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,100
It to the music.

218
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:25,490
Fine.

219
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,323
All right,

220
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,520

221
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,563

222
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,563
new shit.

223
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,310
Powerful.

224
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,470
Yo,

225
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:43,980
there we go.

226
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,850
Power for world travel.

227
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,973
Tom Rhodes,

228
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,060
you're the fucking man,

229
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:47,480
dude,

230
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:47,841
you are.

231
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,190
You are in my opinion,

232
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:51,110
if you want to like talk about like the,

233
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,090
even if you had to like a romantic
poetic version of the life of the standup

234
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:56,460
comedian,

235
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,290
then you'd be like an intelligent world
traveler who literally literally lives

236
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,041
out of a suitcase.

237
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:01,431
Man.

238
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:04,160
He's just happy going from city to city,

239
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:05,510
just making people laugh.

240
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:05,840
But,

241
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,790
but smart and well read,

242
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:08,241
you know,

243
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:08,751
you're like a,

244
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:09,920
you're very prolific dude.

245
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,490
You're like the re like no one
could criticize your road game.

246
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,470
This is not nothing they can say like,

247
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:15,671
no.

248
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:15,980
He's like,

249
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,371
Oh man,

250
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:17,810
I did 300 data sets here.

251
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,201
Oh,

252
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:19,034
it was funny.

253
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,750
Tom Rhodes is 365.

254
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,231
Okay.

255
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:22,490
And they were all in another country.

256
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,890
You fucking out there dude.

257
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:25,691
Uh,

258
00:07:25,691 --> 00:07:26,280
you know,

259
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,420
I'm living the life I dreamed of man.

260
00:07:28,421 --> 00:07:29,021
And I just,

261
00:07:29,021 --> 00:07:31,120
I just fell in love with
a new country I was in.

262
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:31,321
Well,

263
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:31,771
I and I,

264
00:07:31,771 --> 00:07:34,420
I should start out saying death squad,

265
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,410
Joe Rogan listeners,

266
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:35,681
man.

267
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:37,420
I was in London in January.

268
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,390
Loads of people came to
my show in Australia,

269
00:07:40,391 --> 00:07:40,931
New Zealand.

270
00:07:40,931 --> 00:07:42,250
I always meet cool people,

271
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:42,850
uh,

272
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:43,340
you know,

273
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,173
heard me on,

274
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,063
on your show.

275
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,180
And uh,

276
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:50,320
I was just in New Zealand for a month
and I had the greatest trip of my life.

277
00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:51,154
I did the,

278
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,360
the Auckland,

279
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,970
the New Zealand comedy festival
in Auckland for two weeks.

280
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,110
And then I did this like best of the
fest tour that went all over the country

281
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,730
and I'd never been in New Zealand before.

282
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,653
Wasn't alive.

283
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,650
It's epic.

284
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,131
It's,

285
00:08:03,131 --> 00:08:04,250
it's a habit.

286
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,670
Like I went down,

287
00:08:05,671 --> 00:08:07,870
I went to Hobbiton.

288
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,460
It's there,

289
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,710
there's a town there called
Hamilton and everybody,

290
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,510
all the comedians made fun of Hamilton.

291
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,151
Hamilton was,

292
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:15,410
is like the shit hole.

293
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,350
It's the Cleveland or whatever.

294
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,780
I actually loved it.

295
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:21,310
I had some of the best meals,

296
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,320
the food in all the restaurants in New
Zealand where it's really expensive but

297
00:08:26,321 --> 00:08:27,154
very good.

298
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,060
Um,

299
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,140
I had great meals.

300
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:34,000
There's a street in Hamilton called
Victoria Street and there's a,

301
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:38,530
it is a little tiny park and
there's a statute of riff raff.

302
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:40,180
Remember Rocky Horror Picture show?

303
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,630
Let's do the time warp again.

304
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,020
That Guy Richard O'Brien
that played riff Raff,

305
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:48,160
he wrote that song.

306
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,690
It says a statue of him,

307
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:54,370
like this gay dude with pumps and like
a space suit and a space gun in his hand

308
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,160
and it's very appropriate that
all the people who do drugs,

309
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,360
it's like this drug park and the people
are slipping in a real street urgent

310
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:03,691
drug,

311
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:05,220
addicts slipping in and out of the place.

312
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,810
But that was brilliant that they had
this touch at the entrance of the park or

313
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:10,644
people that use drugs.

314
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,633
So,

315
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,690
uh,

316
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,110
the,

317
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,610
the tour manager,

318
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,990
I told her they were,

319
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,560
cause you know,

320
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,960
New Zealand is the land of extreme sports.

321
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,180
I wouldn't jump off this fucking chair.

322
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,740
And I said the only thing I want to do
while I'm in New Zealand is as go to the

323
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:26,574
hobbit house.

324
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,800
So she contacted the dude
that ran the place and uh,

325
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,400
got him tickets cause all those toward
all those festival shows were sold out.

326
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,270
And this,

327
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,010
we got a private tour of,

328
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:38,730
of Hobbiton.

329
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,540
It's still there.

330
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,380
What does it look like?

331
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:40,951
Does it look,

332
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:42,000
it's up on the hill.

333
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:43,620
It's like I'm one that it's just perfect.

334
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,600
There was a,

335
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,030
uh,

336
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,250
when Peter Jackson was
looking around New Zealand,

337
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,310
he had to be the finest big tree.

338
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,300
Uh,

339
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,710
it's the party tree of,

340
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:53,550
of Hobbiton.

341
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,220
And so it's this perfect
spot that the guy found.

342
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,300
So it was a real tree that
was there and not still there,

343
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,101
just massive,

344
00:09:59,101 --> 00:09:59,790
beautiful tree.

345
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,350
And there's these hills all around it.

346
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,590
And they built the little hobbit
houses into the side of the,

347
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:05,521
the thing.

348
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,680
And it did people guard
them like how they keep,

349
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:08,090
you know,

350
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,450
they do tours.

351
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,650
It's like 70 bucks.

352
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,701
You go on a tour.

353
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:14,580
But we got a private tour from
the dude that runs a place.

354
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,420
Oh Wow.

355
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,710
And so normally you on the tour,

356
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:18,660
you can't like go up
to the doors and stuff.

357
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:20,430
You've got to stay behind
the little tiny fences.

358
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:21,360
But this dude let us,

359
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:25,230
we stick our heads out of the doors
and taking pictures and it was raining.

360
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:26,340
There wasn't very many people there,

361
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:27,630
but um,

362
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,583
it was,

363
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,461
it was incredible.

364
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:31,590
And then there's a little tavern at the,

365
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,940
what are the insides of those things?

366
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:33,930
Looks like nothing.

367
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:35,940
Cause they had the sets
built in Wellington,

368
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,950
so they just would film people going in,

369
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,803
in and out.

370
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,150
Right.

371
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,721
That was a stupid,

372
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:43,830
but there's the fence that didn't fit
that bill bell Baggins jumps over the

373
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:44,700
fence at the beginning.

374
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:47,880
I'm going on a great adventure
and the dude let me jump over it.

375
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,620
That's fucking awesome.

376
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,603
Wow.

377
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:51,391
Yeah.

378
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:52,590
I've never been in New Zealand,

379
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:54,000
but it looks insane.

380
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,650
It looked so beautiful.

381
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,150
It looks like incredible.

382
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,984
Like the mountains.

383
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,450
Then the north island year,

384
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,050
which they say is the lesser spectacular.

385
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:04,581
Uh,

386
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,940
I thought it looked like California,

387
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,380
like northern California.

388
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,120
And then the South Island is like,

389
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:12,270
that's where all the majestic
lord of the rings shots are.

390
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,010
And that's really stunning down there.

391
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:14,903
Wow.

392
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,570
Wow.

393
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,020
And that,

394
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,681
why do you say that?

395
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:17,940
They're like the kings of,

396
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:18,810
of uh,

397
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:19,621
extreme sports.

398
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:20,341
Like what they invented,

399
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:22,260
bungee jumping and yeah,

400
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,210
that was invented in New Zealand and uh,

401
00:11:24,211 --> 00:11:25,410
all these like crazy.

402
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,031
They're,

403
00:11:26,031 --> 00:11:28,260
that they're all into this crazy,

404
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:28,830
you know,

405
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,850
anything extreme.

406
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:30,500
Why,

407
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,410
why is that your thing?

408
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,790
There's this warrior people,

409
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,870
so it goes back to the
Maoris and their manliness.

410
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,560
And that's the key,

411
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,640
the cool thing of,

412
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:39,451
of New Zealand too.

413
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:40,030
They get the,

414
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,390
that manly now everything.

415
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:43,590
I saw a dude,

416
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,640
very tall,

417
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,470
handsome Mallory Guy,

418
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:51,000
about 25 walking in the street in Oakland
and he had that tattoo on his face.

419
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,840
Oh.

420
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,560
And there was a couple Maori,

421
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,350
um,

422
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:57,770
comedians and people that worked at the
club where I was playing in Oakland and

423
00:11:57,771 --> 00:11:58,240
they,

424
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,690
I was out,

425
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,600
I was asking him about it.

426
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,820
I should point out that you're
covering your mouth like a,

427
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,770
like a gas mask again,

428
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,770
like a gas mask over the,

429
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:06,560
exactly.

430
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,190
Precisely.

431
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,760
Wow.

432
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,620
And I asked about it and they were like,

433
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:09,831
oh yeah,

434
00:12:09,831 --> 00:12:12,020
that dude's very important in his tribe.

435
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:12,381
He's like,

436
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:12,840
uh,

437
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,130
you know,

438
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,030
but he was like a young,

439
00:12:14,031 --> 00:12:15,260
young Gish dude.

440
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,520
He's very important.

441
00:12:16,521 --> 00:12:17,930
So he tattoos his mouth.

442
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,011
I,

443
00:12:19,011 --> 00:12:19,990
you know what,

444
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,650
that's an ancient,

445
00:12:21,651 --> 00:12:22,760
ancient tradition.

446
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,570
Ancient.

447
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:23,840
Yeah.

448
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,490
I saw a woman with facial tattoos,

449
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,463
Maori women,

450
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,620
little tiny things,

451
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,540
which must be badges of honor somehow.

452
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,560
Ooh,

453
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:30,991
that's,

454
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:33,950
so that's a crazy culture that
their ticket to the next level.

455
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,390
They're like,

456
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:34,640
well,

457
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,170
how about we all tend to our face.

458
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:36,900
Right.

459
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,611
How about that?

460
00:12:37,611 --> 00:12:37,861
Yeah.

461
00:12:37,861 --> 00:12:39,140
I wanted to find out if,

462
00:12:39,141 --> 00:12:41,290
you know how they felt about
the Mike Tyson copying it.

463
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,080
Like if he's like,

464
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,010
they think he's a punk,

465
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:43,540
you know,

466
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,350
this is a bodybuilder did it too.

467
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,190
I've been asked him everything.

468
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,350
He had the very Mike
Tyson like gigantic dude.

469
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,630
He's got it on his phone and do the dance.

470
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:53,991
If you're,

471
00:12:53,991 --> 00:12:55,400
if you're going to get the facial tattoo,

472
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:55,641
you know,

473
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:56,051
like the,

474
00:12:56,051 --> 00:12:56,760
the Haka.

475
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,110
Yeah.

476
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,400
Yeah.

477
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,233
Isn't that cool?

478
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,340
They danced before their
opponent and rented them.

479
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:01,671
Yeah.

480
00:13:01,671 --> 00:13:02,860
My friend Steph and uh,

481
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,041
turned me onto that.

482
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,510
He sent it to me the first
time he sent it to me.

483
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:06,141
It was like a,

484
00:13:06,141 --> 00:13:08,930
it's a beginning of a
rugby match and these,

485
00:13:08,931 --> 00:13:09,764
uh,

486
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,330
uh,

487
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,163
the all black,

488
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,110
oh my God,

489
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,970
it's so intense.

490
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:17,990
It's like the manliest shit that humans
have ever done other than like fight

491
00:13:17,991 --> 00:13:18,824
with swords.

492
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,650
The manliest Shit you
could do is that dance?

493
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:22,310
Yeah.

494
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,791
Have you seen that?

495
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,020
Brion pull it up.

496
00:13:24,021 --> 00:13:24,411
Pull it up.

497
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:25,580
Thought Haka Dance.

498
00:13:25,581 --> 00:13:26,360
Yeah.

499
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,390
Let me see if I could find
like a good version of it.

500
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,530
Because a,

501
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,880
there's a black and white,

502
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:35,540
I think it's an Adidas ad for
like Adidas rugby equipment.

503
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,500
Yeah.

504
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,320
It's just says the Haka Award Dance Rugby.

505
00:13:39,321 --> 00:13:40,340
It's the first one.

506
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:41,060
If it just,

507
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,893
I love take care.

508
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,391
And you know,

509
00:13:42,391 --> 00:13:43,171
the Maoris,

510
00:13:43,171 --> 00:13:43,561
uh,

511
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:43,891
you know,

512
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:45,450
they were never like colonized.

513
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,270
They like constantly fought the
British when the British came.

514
00:13:48,271 --> 00:13:50,400
Like I read the history of Australia,

515
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:52,970
there's a great book by
Robert Hughes called uh,

516
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:57,210
the fatal shore and it's all about the
epic founding of Australia who these guys

517
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,044
are doing it.

518
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,833
Yeah.

519
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,440
Was there a beginning?

520
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:07,420
Yeah,

521
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,420
we missed the EMS,

522
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,310
the dance that would,

523
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:10,380
they just showed a loans.

524
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:11,763
Oh No.

525
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:12,341
Oh,

526
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:13,174
there you go.

527
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:13,871
Oh,

528
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:14,980
the dance keeps going.

529
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,730
Yeah.

530
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:15,941
Yeah.

531
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:16,181
It's,

532
00:14:16,181 --> 00:14:17,014
yeah,

533
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,850
something terrifying
about that kind of energy.

534
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,181
Yeah.

535
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:28,961
So imagine,

536
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:29,201
you know,

537
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,630
like the aboriginals in Australia,

538
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:32,620
when I was going to say from that book,

539
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,160
they were very friendly when the British
and the convicts came and they're like,

540
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:36,671
you know,

541
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:38,800
rushed out to the boats and
bringing them fruit and stuff.

542
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,120
The Maoris did nothing but
attack these motherfuckers.

543
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:47,800
Imagine you're coming from England and
you get off and these native people are

544
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:49,600
doing this dance to you and they're like,

545
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,710
we're bashing their heads with rocks
and just hiding in caves and guerrilla

546
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:55,640
warfare to the end.

547
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:55,851
I mean,

548
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:59,750
imagine you're like some white Dorky dude
from England and you're a ship arrives

549
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:00,584
in New Zealand.

550
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,030
He's motherfuckers come out of the cave
and do that grunt dancing to get back on

551
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:06,140
the motherfucking boat.

552
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,300
Could you imagine if that's your fuck up?

553
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:09,650
Cause that's what it was back then.

554
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,690
I mean when they were
exploring new countries,

555
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:12,381
there was a lot of,

556
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:12,921
it was just like,

557
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:15,110
you're going to pull into this
harbor and let's see what's up.

558
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:15,740
Right?

559
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,770
Yeah.

560
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,860
But I ain't never seen a white guy before.

561
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:20,390
You never seen one of them before.

562
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,321
Captain Cook,

563
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,690
the guy he did was his
greatest English explorer,

564
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:23,931
I think.

565
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:24,141
You know,

566
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:24,920
he found,

567
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,400
uh,

568
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,880
Australia and the Cook Islands,

569
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:29,820
they,

570
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,980
they killed him in Hawaii.

571
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,443
The natives there.

572
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,340
Fuck candidate.

573
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:33,621
But he,

574
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:33,751
you know,

575
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:35,060
he had a good career leading up here.

576
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,120
Well,

577
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,953
he just,

578
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,551
he was like,

579
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:37,900
you know,

580
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,930
it's taught luck.

581
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:40,580
You never know what you're
going to get on certain islands.

582
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:41,180
You know,

583
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,080
some bring you fruit,

584
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:42,711
some one,

585
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:43,810
a bachelor you have
with the fucking right.

586
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:45,920
Some will eat you and turn
you into a shrunken head.

587
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,420
I finally figured out what
the shrunken head was.

588
00:15:48,421 --> 00:15:51,290
I'm watched a show on shrunken heads,

589
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,330
like the tradition of doing it.

590
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,120
Oh,

591
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,180
we only you do that.

592
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,300
You're lying around your house.

593
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,470
Like,

594
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,700
what will I entertain myself?

595
00:15:58,701 --> 00:15:59,040
Was it,

596
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,210
no,

597
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,380
it was a total channel flip.

598
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:01,280
I'm not shrunk in it.

599
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,780
It was a total channel flipper.

600
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,251
I should,

601
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:04,084
it's creepy.

602
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,841
It's creepy as fuck,

603
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:06,660
man.

604
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,430
I was,

605
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,690
I was under the impression that

606
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,020
the scholars in there,

607
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:10,943
it's not,

608
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,240
they take the skull out and they're
basically shrinking the skin down to like

609
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:19,020
this leatherish smallest thing and then
they pull it in to make it like a little

610
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:19,854
purse out of it.

611
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,630
It's gangster as fuck.

612
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:23,441
I mean,

613
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,740
the shrunken head move is one of
the most gangster things ever.

614
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,753
You know,

615
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,370
they're not just going to
take your head and cut it off.

616
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,590
They're going to make a
little ornament with it.

617
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,700
A little.

618
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,533
Yeah.

619
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,860
It's a little leather ornament.

620
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,820
Wow.

621
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,653
What the fuck?

622
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,093
You know,

623
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:43,090
people who just never bothered like with
anything like books and fuck a book.

624
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,421
Okay,

625
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:44,800
we're here to make shrunken heads.

626
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:46,571
Well that was it.

627
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:46,721
Like,

628
00:16:46,721 --> 00:16:46,961
you know,

629
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:47,471
like a,

630
00:16:47,471 --> 00:16:47,801
you know,

631
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:49,000
television and the Internet,

632
00:16:49,001 --> 00:16:49,421
you think about it.

633
00:16:49,421 --> 00:16:52,180
Cause like back in the old days in
England and the way they tortured people,

634
00:16:52,181 --> 00:16:53,780
you look at like torture instruments.

635
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,240
It was because they
didn't have television.

636
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:55,560
Yeah.

637
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,740
Like how are we going
to entertain herself?

638
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:57,500
Well,

639
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,570
that's funny because you know,

640
00:16:58,571 --> 00:17:00,310
Biden is imposing or

641
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:01,830
encouraging,

642
00:17:01,831 --> 00:17:02,664
endorsing,

643
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,600
proposing a tax on the
producers of violent movies.

644
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:07,650
Wow.

645
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,820
Violent movies,

646
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:10,100
Violent v media,

647
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,490
violent video games,

648
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,600
and they're considered,

649
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,730
they're considering imposing a tax,

650
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,680
a special tax on that.

651
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:18,630
I think the opposite.

652
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,340
I really believed this,

653
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:22,980
and this is not an
indictment on the human race.

654
00:17:22,981 --> 00:17:26,430
I think naturally we're just a
little fucked up and chimpanzee like,

655
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:31,730
but I think that seeing things like
violent movies and violent video games are

656
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:37,761
probably like the most cathartic ways to
avoid doing those things in real life.

657
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,870
Like there's something that gets satisfied
without us having to actually go and

658
00:17:42,871 --> 00:17:44,010
kill someone in a war.

659
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,910
That's one of the reasons why the most
passive people in the world are fucking

660
00:17:47,911 --> 00:17:49,230
comic book nerds.

661
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:49,771
I mean,

662
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:54,360
who the hell wants to see damage and
destruction more that a comic book nerd

663
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:55,710
going to watch a hulk movie?

664
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,430
You go watch the hog and he's smashing
and destroying shit or wolverines

665
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:01,300
stabbing dudes with their fucking clause.

666
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,760
You know those guys well,

667
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,613
her to fly.

668
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:04,921
Right,

669
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:05,101
right,

670
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:05,221
right.

671
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:06,054
That's a really good point.

672
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,100
The average dudes were like really into
like heavy duty Psi Phi and heavy duty

673
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:11,850
action,

674
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:12,240
you know,

675
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,631
action,

676
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:13,590
Scifi films,

677
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,030
those kind of Dudes,

678
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,380
like they don't,

679
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,000
they're not harming people.

680
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:18,721
It's,

681
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:23,090
I think there's a cathartic release and
being attached to extreme things without

682
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,690
have to actually participate in them.

683
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,921
That's a good point.

684
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:26,110
I mean,

685
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,920
and they should be concentrating on
making society better place and like

686
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:29,431
certain,

687
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:29,830
you know,

688
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,500
man,

689
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,333
you know,

690
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,780
some of the inequality and um,

691
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,520
you know,

692
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,353
uh,

693
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,760
class,

694
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,820
I think once you're fucked up already
a violence something or another,

695
00:18:39,821 --> 00:18:44,140
any kind of violent media can
influence you and can excite you.

696
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,100
But the reality is you have to be that
you have to be fucked up for it to work.

697
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,950
And the idea of concentrating
on that as a cause,

698
00:18:50,951 --> 00:18:53,860
it's not a cost that's causes
you've got a mental health issue.

699
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,491
Right.

700
00:18:54,491 --> 00:18:54,881
That's the thing.

701
00:18:54,881 --> 00:18:55,301
It should be,

702
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:55,771
we should be,

703
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:57,910
it should be more concerned
about people's mental health.

704
00:18:57,911 --> 00:18:59,560
That Guy Andres Breivik,

705
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:01,930
the lunatic in Norway
that shot the island,

706
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,120
you know,

707
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,730
um,

708
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,770
he desensitized himself for a year.

709
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:08,140
He sat in his mom's basement
and I'd follow that.

710
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,250
I was obsessed with that trial and
that dude is so fucking sinister.

711
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,060
Um,

712
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,870
but he,

713
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:16,570
he's thought about shooting people
while he was doing it and then he would

714
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:18,160
desensitize himself that I wouldn't,

715
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,083
um,

716
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:19,571
you know,

717
00:19:19,571 --> 00:19:19,861
his,

718
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:19,960
uh,

719
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,410
he could work past that consciousness
telling him not to do it.

720
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,551
So I mean,

721
00:19:24,551 --> 00:19:25,720
that guy was just a sick fuck.

722
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,650
Yeah.

723
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,390
And not everybody that plays that,

724
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,710
millions of people probably played that,

725
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,540
uh,

726
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:30,880
you know,

727
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,280
world of war craft or
whatever the fuck he was into.

728
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,120
But yeah.

729
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,953
Yeah.

730
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,750
Only you can't blame that.

731
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,460
It's just doesn't work that way.

732
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:42,760
It's like blaming cars for crashing
into people and killing them.

733
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,490
It's not,

734
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,291
it's not,

735
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,390
the video game does make
be able people nuts.

736
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,020
You got nuts that are reacting to
video games and the way to solve that.

737
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:53,200
It's not taking away the video
games or tax of video games.

738
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,980
The way to solve that is find out what
the fuck is wrong with people that makes

739
00:19:56,981 --> 00:19:57,820
them do that.

740
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:58,803
What is it?

741
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,100
What is it that makes a person
able to commit horrific acts?

742
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:02,360
Yeah.

743
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,490
I look at the dude in Cleveland.

744
00:20:03,491 --> 00:20:04,600
He kept those girls,

745
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,020
you know,

746
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,390
he's torturing them and he's
raping them for like 10 years.

747
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,110
What,

748
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,030
what media was he until well,

749
00:20:10,031 --> 00:20:10,721
magazines.

750
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:11,471
Was He reading?

751
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:11,880
You know what,

752
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,713
Eh,

753
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,713
um,

754
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,500
you know,

755
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,150
always life.

756
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:15,983
Yeah.

757
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:17,881
Yeah.

758
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:18,130
Well,

759
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,040
or I don't think it had
anything to do with that.

760
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,500
I think someone dehumanize him.

761
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,090
Probably a long time ago.

762
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,020
If someone raised him in
some horrific environment,

763
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,250
they created a monster,

764
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:29,520
right?

765
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,710
Somehow or another through circumstance,

766
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,870
nurture nature,

767
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,300
whatever.

768
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,133
You got a monster.

769
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,070
I'm more scared of ex military than I am
with people that play too much hardcore

770
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:38,731
video games.

771
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:39,564
And you should be,

772
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,141
yeah,

773
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:40,561
you should,

774
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:42,870
but you should be scared of
anybody who's taking life.

775
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,250
You know,

776
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:43,591
once you,

777
00:20:43,591 --> 00:20:45,330
once you've taken
someone's life and done it,

778
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:45,721
you know,

779
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:47,480
and to a point where it's sanctioned.

780
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,050
Yeah.

781
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:48,321
It's,

782
00:20:48,321 --> 00:20:49,250
it's problematic.

783
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,410
Not Everybody has a discipline,

784
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:50,711
the handle,

785
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:51,544
something like that.

786
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,191
You know,

787
00:20:52,191 --> 00:20:53,024
a lot of that's,

788
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,590
you know,

789
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:59,450
it's admirable how many guys can be
disciplined to come back from that and be

790
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:00,200
okay.

791
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,030
But for a lot of people
know a lot of people,

792
00:21:02,031 --> 00:21:07,031
it's just that that PTSD man is just
unbearable for a lot of those guys.

793
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,420
If they say that one of the best things
for PTSD is Mtma is a ecstasy and

794
00:21:13,641 --> 00:21:15,080
they're having headway in,

795
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,500
um,

796
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,880
and doing that in,

797
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,840
in therapeutic,

798
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,650
uh,

799
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:23,650
with therapeutic applications of Mtma
and the helping people that have,

800
00:21:23,901 --> 00:21:24,380
uh,

801
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,730
all sorts of PTSD,

802
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,520
post traumatic stress disorder
for people don't like acronyms.

803
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,020
That's telling me an acronym.

804
00:21:30,021 --> 00:21:30,410
Is it,

805
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,820
is it an acronym like NASA,

806
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:32,600
when you say it,

807
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,351
that's an acronym,

808
00:21:33,351 --> 00:21:33,620
right?

809
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:33,951
I don't know.

810
00:21:33,951 --> 00:21:37,060
What is it when it's just like CIA,

811
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,520
you know,

812
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,810
you're not calling it Chia.

813
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,670
I can't spell restaurant.

814
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,170
Yeah.

815
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:42,710
Restaurant.

816
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,390
I rely on my iPhone for that.

817
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,430
I get to res to,

818
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:48,681
yeah,

819
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:49,260
man.

820
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,520
Remember when you used to have to fucking
write out a paper and turn it into

821
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:53,354
school?

822
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,220
You have to act.

823
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,880
You just have to write it out and
know how to spell each number.

824
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,733
One of those words.

825
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,330
Now I just get close and
it gives me a real load,

826
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,090
squiggly line to do a little right quick.

827
00:22:02,091 --> 00:22:02,391
I'm like,

828
00:22:02,391 --> 00:22:02,630
yeah,

829
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,530
that's what I was looking for.

830
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,011
You know,

831
00:22:04,011 --> 00:22:04,380
I don't,

832
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,310
and that's all you need.

833
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,880
It's not like you need to know that.

834
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,760
It's kind of funny how
little you do know though.

835
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,320
It's Kinda funny how little,

836
00:22:12,321 --> 00:22:13,154
you know,

837
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,800
like my eyes are going,

838
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,990
when I look at things like as
far as like the reach of my hand,

839
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:21,824
I'm fine,

840
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,510
but when I get close for whatever reason,

841
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,580
like reading things close,

842
00:22:25,581 --> 00:22:26,181
it's just blurry.

843
00:22:26,181 --> 00:22:27,014
It's fucked now.

844
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,580
And um,

845
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,270
when I,

846
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,600
when I see things like,

847
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,434
um,

848
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:37,550
I have to like find like
the place where it works.

849
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,200
Yeah.

850
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,040
Hipster glasses.

851
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:39,580
Dude.

852
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,470
I don't know why you don't do it.

853
00:22:40,471 --> 00:22:41,320
I think glasses are cool.

854
00:22:41,321 --> 00:22:42,520
If I could wear glasses,

855
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,920
I wear glasses every day.

856
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,810
I don't remember what my point was,

857
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,420
what we were talking about before I
went and says blessed the video games.

858
00:22:49,421 --> 00:22:50,620
Torture people.

859
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,750
A soldier's seeing,

860
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:54,940
seen combat and have
an ecstasy treatments.

861
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,730
The shark that was found off the coast
of Huntington beach might be a road

862
00:22:57,731 --> 00:22:58,180
record.

863
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,880
Why Spreaker shark?

864
00:22:59,881 --> 00:23:00,530
Did you say shocked?

865
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,320
It was found or check this out.

866
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,550
It was caught off of,

867
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,420
oh Geez.

868
00:23:04,421 --> 00:23:07,120
It's 11 foot shark was
caught Monday morning,

869
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:07,690
uh,

870
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,420
outside of Huntington
beach and Catalina Island.

871
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,610
The size of that fucking thing.

872
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,510
Yeah.

873
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,291
1000,

874
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:16,660
323 pounds.

875
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,460
What the fuck?

876
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,270
Wow.

877
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,470
Oh God damn it.

878
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,050
This guy's beard.

879
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,540
It is that,

880
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:24,851
that,

881
00:23:24,851 --> 00:23:26,200
that world,

882
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,120
if that thing could fucking fly,

883
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:28,541
okay,

884
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:31,150
if sharks instead of swimming around,

885
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:31,620
wow,

886
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,600
the three d rounds,

887
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,790
if they could fly,

888
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,360
if they were on our world and they could
just fly around and eat people the way

889
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:38,530
they move through the ocean,

890
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:39,481
God damn.

891
00:23:39,481 --> 00:23:40,211
Would it be scary?

892
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,190
The ocean is so much more fucked up.

893
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,840
That's why nothing ever gets done.

894
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,770
That's the shows that it's,

895
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:46,010
there's

896
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,780
a benefit like as far as progress to
having one intellectually superior species

897
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:52,190
that gets to control the food chain.

898
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,640
That gets to put a halt to all the
bullshit and then figure out things like

899
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:57,890
roofs and the Internet and cars.

900
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,380
Because if you can't keep
those things from eating you,

901
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:03,440
you wind up with the ocean where
no one ever builds a fucking house.

902
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,311
You're best.

903
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:07,430
Ocean is like a fucking
one of those crabs.

904
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,480
Hermit crabs.

905
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,090
They just scoot to the next
little shell and climb under it,

906
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:11,661
but that's,

907
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:14,750
shell only exists because somebody
eight whoever was living in it,

908
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,300
somebody found it and ate it and now
you're going to hide it in there.

909
00:24:17,301 --> 00:24:17,690
You're going to fall.

910
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,210
You're going to hide
inside of his body cavity.

911
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,003
That's the ocean.

912
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,690
That's why there's,

913
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,110
there's no one that's phones in the ocean.

914
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,490
There's nothing gets done in there.

915
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,070
He just,

916
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,290
it's a constant move.

917
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,720
It's three d you can control things.

918
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,240
The thing that made us able to
rise above all the other animals,

919
00:24:33,241 --> 00:24:36,830
so we are the control and
lockdown areas and put up fences.

920
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,390
We can keep things out,

921
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,280
can't keep anything
out in the ocean pitch.

922
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,630
The ocean is just the ocean.

923
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,690
It's just a wild brown bag and
there's no way to solve that.

924
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,520
So all the dolphins in the world,

925
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:46,971
you know,

926
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:47,930
as smart as they are,

927
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:48,950
it's supposed to be as smart as us.

928
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,540
They never figured out a fucking house.

929
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,960
They never figured out how to build some
shelter where they could just like get

930
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,370
I from tied to get eaten by sharks.

931
00:24:55,371 --> 00:24:56,204
How you guys want to do this?

932
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,640
Let's make a house or something
like something with a shark.

933
00:24:58,641 --> 00:25:00,290
Can't get through Barb wire.

934
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,001
They can't do it.

935
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:02,930
There's not enough time.

936
00:25:02,931 --> 00:25:03,764
Keep moving.

937
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,000
Keep moving.

938
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,051
Get more fish.

939
00:25:06,051 --> 00:25:06,321
Go,

940
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:06,531
go,

941
00:25:06,531 --> 00:25:08,750
go those Japanese bolts fucking rotten.

942
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,100
You should turn that into a bit.

943
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:10,934
That's brilliant.

944
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:11,470
Thanks.

945
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,680
Let's try and make,

946
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,613
make a note of that one.

947
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,253
That's brilliant.

948
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,213
That's a great bit.

949
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,103
Alright,

950
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,073
what did I say again?

951
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:22,690
What if for the future we had to
live underneath the ocean because we,

952
00:25:22,691 --> 00:25:22,910
you know,

953
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:27,910
the air pollution or the weather or
something like that forces us to have to

954
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:28,840
build houses.

955
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,360
They would do that before outer space.

956
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,933
The atmosphere.

957
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,860
I mean you could be like,

958
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:34,670
you could say,

959
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:34,881
hey,

960
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:39,050
we need to build this house under ground
here instead of having to go up space.

961
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,130
Oh you forgot the ranch.

962
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,150
You have to come back.

963
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:41,983
Well,

964
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,250
we'd get lonely.

965
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,383
Yeah,

966
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,730
that'd be pretty bad ass though.

967
00:25:45,731 --> 00:25:48,410
If like we all like our walls
were just like looking inside

968
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,200
under anything.

969
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,460
How much shit eats things
with its face in the ocean.

970
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,250
Just think of how crazy the ocean is.

971
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,780
It's just one big motherfucker trying
to eat a smaller motherfucker while I'm

972
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:00,351
even bigger.

973
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:01,670
Motherfucker tries to eat him.

974
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,330
Like that's one of the coolest things
about catching a fish and having an attack

975
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:06,540
by a shark while you're reeling in.

976
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:07,760
And have you ever had that happen?

977
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,000
No.

978
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,541
Reeling it in.

979
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:11,350
Wallin Shark is by yeah

980
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,473
me neither.

981
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,313
But it looks awesome.

982
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,710
That's something I'd like to experience
but I've seen guys do that and like deep

983
00:26:16,711 --> 00:26:17,311
sea fishing,

984
00:26:17,311 --> 00:26:20,340
like they catch a big tuna or something
like that and it has to bring in a

985
00:26:20,341 --> 00:26:21,121
fucking shark.

986
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,740
Attacks it and tears it in half.

987
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,960
If you were seeing like the
pictures and the images online.

988
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:25,530
Yeah,

989
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:28,770
it's fucking fascinating cause
that's what the the ocean,

990
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,420
it's just just a fucking crazy
gangster fight with your face all day.

991
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,150
The biggest shit trying
to eat the biggest shit.

992
00:26:36,151 --> 00:26:40,560
I mean a tuna is a bad motherfucker just
running around jacking smaller fish,

993
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,670
but not small.

994
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,030
Nope.

995
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:42,990
Shark comes along.

996
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,431
Jack's the tuna.

997
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:45,630
It's just a wild race.

998
00:26:45,631 --> 00:26:48,360
We pulled the sharks out where
the top of the food chain,

999
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,260
I love when I lived in Holland,

1000
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:55,290
the the symbol of the lottery in Holland
is a big fish eating a little fish.

1001
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,583
Oh my God.

1002
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,143
Yeah.

1003
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:58,810
That's,

1004
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,340
that's true to life.

1005
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,930
You got money is big fish for a
little while till you're fucked.

1006
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,080
Till the fucking shark comes along.

1007
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,180
You crazy ass loses it.

1008
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,410
I bet if you win the lottery,

1009
00:27:08,411 --> 00:27:11,560
I bet you were just immediately
assaulted by con people.

1010
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:11,870
Yeah.

1011
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,730
Bit Con Artists.

1012
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:15,280
Just look for someone who won
the lottery and like this one.

1013
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:15,581
The fucker.

1014
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:15,990
Thanks buddy.

1015
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,823
It comes easy.

1016
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,430
I just talk him into investment.

1017
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,850
I don't invest in a wonderful
investment on fraternity.

1018
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,420
Don't go on television.

1019
00:27:22,421 --> 00:27:22,661
Don't,

1020
00:27:22,661 --> 00:27:22,991
don't hold.

1021
00:27:22,991 --> 00:27:23,230
Don't,

1022
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,000
don't take pictures of
you holding the big check.

1023
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,110
Yeah.

1024
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:26,770
Wonderful.

1025
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,970
Wonderful opportunities.

1026
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,630
Holding this money that
you think you deserve.

1027
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,240
The whole idea of a lot of
these fucking ridiculous,

1028
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,630
well they say the money was originally
supposed to go to education in this

1029
00:27:37,631 --> 00:27:39,020
country and then yeah,

1030
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:39,610
none of it.

1031
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,770
You know what they realized
the more educated people are,

1032
00:27:41,771 --> 00:27:43,660
the less likely that I
play the fucking lottery.

1033
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:44,920
They'd be cutting their own feet.

1034
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,070
Sold that United States
that the lottery thing.

1035
00:27:48,071 --> 00:27:48,940
Remember that does that way.

1036
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:49,760
Yeah.

1037
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,070
And as it went state by state
and gambling where it's allowed,

1038
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,750
they always sell it to the public saying
that the biggest portion of this money

1039
00:27:58,751 --> 00:28:02,470
will go to education and
the schools and everything.

1040
00:28:02,471 --> 00:28:04,990
We've been broke for the less 10 20 years.

1041
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,860
And you know,

1042
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,400
where's that?

1043
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,330
Where's that promise?

1044
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,740
Nobody remembers the,

1045
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,760
well it certainly should go to something
good cause you're just stealing money

1046
00:28:12,761 --> 00:28:13,720
from crazy people.

1047
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:14,590
That's what you're doing.

1048
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,610
You're giving people the chance to
throw money away in the very unlikely

1049
00:28:18,611 --> 00:28:19,990
possibility than my winsome.

1050
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:20,591
And like,

1051
00:28:20,591 --> 00:28:24,400
it's like I grew up in Orlando and there's
the East West Expressway and it was a

1052
00:28:24,401 --> 00:28:28,180
toll road and they said when they built
it in the early eighties that once it

1053
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:29,680
was paid for that take the tolls down,

1054
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,500
but they never did it just now.

1055
00:28:32,501 --> 00:28:33,490
They raised the prices.

1056
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,430
It's like that lottery casino thing.

1057
00:28:36,431 --> 00:28:39,790
It's like you can sell it to the people
and then they'll fucking forget 10 years

1058
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:40,390
from now.

1059
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,720
Once you establish that money's coming in,

1060
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,140
it's very difficult to stop that.

1061
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:48,610
Then no one ever likes to
bridge things free now.

1062
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,690
Nobody ever has enough.

1063
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,360
Especially

1064
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,830
it's like nine bucks a pop,

1065
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:53,210
like you go over the Gw.

1066
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,620
I think in New York now it's like,

1067
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,130
correct me if I'm wrong,

1068
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,640
so I think it's like $9 or at
least it might even be more,

1069
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,160
but every time you're going
there you're getting a hit.

1070
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,060
When I was living there,

1071
00:29:02,061 --> 00:29:05,360
I think it was like seven 50 or
something like that and I was like,

1072
00:29:05,361 --> 00:29:06,111
this is insane.

1073
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:10,730
Like every person that comes over this
bridge has to pay $7 just to get into the

1074
00:29:10,731 --> 00:29:10,971
city.

1075
00:29:10,971 --> 00:29:12,410
That's like some gangster shit,

1076
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,101
you know,

1077
00:29:13,101 --> 00:29:15,140
because I lived in Boston and Boston,

1078
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,160
you could take like toll roads
but you can also get to it.

1079
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,040
Like there's ways to get where
you didn't have to pay anything.

1080
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:22,251
You didn't,

1081
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:23,600
if you didn't go on the mass turnpike,

1082
00:29:23,601 --> 00:29:25,670
like there's ways you can go
where he didn't have a toll,

1083
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,480
but there's no way of getting a New
York City lets you paying somebody.

1084
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,580
You want to take those
bridges from Staten Island,

1085
00:29:31,581 --> 00:29:32,810
you can pay me bitch,

1086
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,160
you're coming in from Jersey,

1087
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:35,210
pay me.

1088
00:29:35,211 --> 00:29:36,860
You got to pay to get in here dog.

1089
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:37,903
It's like an,

1090
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,170
it doesn't cost anything to leave.

1091
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,950
It doesn't cost of live
in New York twice and uh,

1092
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,300
deleted all of my funds and uh,

1093
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,250
both times when I moved down in New York,

1094
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:48,790
I,

1095
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,200
as I crossed the free bridge,

1096
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:51,790
I thought it doesn't
cost anything to leave.

1097
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,710
Isn't that fascinating too?

1098
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,930
Is it to regulate how many people come in?

1099
00:29:55,931 --> 00:30:00,070
Is it to mitigate traffic and to make
it like problematic because it cost so

1100
00:30:00,071 --> 00:30:00,521
much money?

1101
00:30:00,521 --> 00:30:01,540
Maybe a Carpool,

1102
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:02,160
is that the idea?

1103
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,993
To tell you a little story?

1104
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:03,800
Sure.

1105
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,633
Uh,

1106
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,220
uh,

1107
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,730
it is a big story actually,

1108
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,980
and I was reminded of,

1109
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:11,920
but you're talking about the George
Washington Bridge and when I was 20 years

1110
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:12,131
old,

1111
00:30:12,131 --> 00:30:13,870
I lived in Washington heights for a year.

1112
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,220
Worst Year of my life.

1113
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:15,880
Why?

1114
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,110
Just the worst year of my life.

1115
00:30:17,111 --> 00:30:17,311
I,

1116
00:30:17,311 --> 00:30:18,490
I wasn't ready as a comedian.

1117
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,360
Oh,

1118
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,140
how old were you?

1119
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:20,680
20.

1120
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:20,861
Oh,

1121
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:21,210
yeah.

1122
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:21,600
Yeah,

1123
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,170
I'd only been doing it like three years.

1124
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:23,291
I,

1125
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:23,621
you know,

1126
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,820
I didn't have been doing it three years
by the time we were just sweating.

1127
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
I started at 17 Bates.

1128
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,210
Where'd you start?

1129
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,010
Orlando powerful.

1130
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:33,250
And Lando produced a couple
of good things and uh,

1131
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:34,211
uh,

1132
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:34,661
anyway,

1133
00:30:34,661 --> 00:30:35,494
so

1134
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:41,790
I always swore if I ever had any money
I would live in New York was style.

1135
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,700
So when my Sitcom was finished,

1136
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,290
a 98,

1137
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:47,801
99,

1138
00:30:47,801 --> 00:30:51,220
I moved to New York City and I got a
rock star apartment in the Wall Street

1139
00:30:51,221 --> 00:30:51,670
area.

1140
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:51,941
Oh,

1141
00:30:51,941 --> 00:30:55,990
you did not considered one of the first
skyscrapers ever built a 20 stories

1142
00:30:55,991 --> 00:30:56,440
tall.

1143
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,780
It's at the entrance of a Wall Street.

1144
00:30:59,050 --> 00:30:59,950
The entrance of Wall Street.

1145
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:01,600
It's Trinity Churches Right there.

1146
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,590
Only on the 18th floor where
their marble balconies.

1147
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,690
I had three marble balconies.

1148
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:08,830
I was on this corner unit,

1149
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,300
just pimp spot.

1150
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,240
Oh my three blocks from
the World Trade Center.

1151
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,001
Oh my goodness.

1152
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:15,130
A 16 foot tall ceilings.

1153
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,050
I could lie in my bed.

1154
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,150
Look up at the World Trade Center.

1155
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,080
It must've been,

1156
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,460
it was,

1157
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,251
it was fantastic.

1158
00:31:21,251 --> 00:31:22,600
But it was a time in my life,

1159
00:31:22,601 --> 00:31:22,781
you know,

1160
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,640
the Sitcom had ended.

1161
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:24,771
I,

1162
00:31:24,771 --> 00:31:26,290
I felt I was angry.

1163
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,750
I was angry and I was,

1164
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,141
I was,

1165
00:31:29,141 --> 00:31:31,930
I was searching for meaning and,

1166
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:32,890
and uh,

1167
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:36,550
what was important in life
and what was making you angry?

1168
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,211
I just,

1169
00:31:37,211 --> 00:31:37,690
you know,

1170
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,480
I had the Sitcom and it didn't
work out and then I just,

1171
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:40,751
you know,

1172
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:44,590
I wanted to just go focus on being
a comedian and live in New York.

1173
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:49,860
So the Dalai Lama was going to give
a speech for free in central park on

1174
00:31:51,191 --> 00:31:54,130
happiness for six months.

1175
00:31:54,131 --> 00:31:56,020
I had the flyer on my refrigerator.

1176
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:00,670
Nothing in the world was going to make
me miss the Dalai Lama's speech on

1177
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,513
happiness.

1178
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,180
So the night before,

1179
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,970
I'm headlining at Caroline's on Broadway.

1180
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And there were these two Puerto Rican
lesbian strippers and they loved me and

1181
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:18,400
they stuck around after the show and
they wanted to talk to me and where we're

1182
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,413
talking.

1183
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,493
And then they,

1184
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,660
they invited me out with them.

1185
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,650
And you know what,

1186
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:24,400
uh,

1187
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,590
there was the queen
bee and the other girl,

1188
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:28,570
the other girl was off limits
because she had a boyfriend.

1189
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,860
I ain't give a fuck about the other girl.

1190
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,310
It was all about the queen bee and the
other girl was in love with the Queen Bee

1191
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,480
cause she was making all the,

1192
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,240
all the decisions and
making everything happen.

1193
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,133
Wow.

1194
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,920
So who's she?

1195
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,810
The Queen Bee had a car.

1196
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,820
We're driving down to
the village somewhere.

1197
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:44,360
Uh,

1198
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,650
they said they had ecstasy.

1199
00:32:45,651 --> 00:32:46,700
Do I want to do ecstasy?

1200
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:47,091
And I'm like,

1201
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:47,924
hell yeah.

1202
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:52,550
We go to some lounge and we're
drinking Pinot Grigio on ice.

1203
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:55,250
And I had never had Pinot
Grigio and my night to this day,

1204
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:58,070
I love Pinot Grigio cause it
reminds me of this evening.

1205
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,750
It's a perfect,

1206
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,280
uh,

1207
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:00,491
you know,

1208
00:33:00,491 --> 00:33:03,170
like red wine is an autumn winter thing.

1209
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:03,741
Uh,

1210
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:04,011
but,

1211
00:33:04,011 --> 00:33:06,350
but a dry white wine,

1212
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,390
like a Pinot Grigio is great in summer.

1213
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,050
So we're in,

1214
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,670
you know,

1215
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,890
we're drinking and we're
having a great time.

1216
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,521
And,

1217
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:13,821
uh,

1218
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:14,121
you know,

1219
00:33:14,121 --> 00:33:15,140
after about an hour,

1220
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:15,500
you know,

1221
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,560
this ecstasy starts
thumping and this girl,

1222
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,390
the queen bee wanted to
go to some dance club.

1223
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:21,980
We go to some dance club in Soho.

1224
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:22,843
It's packed.

1225
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,620
I didn't want to be a packed dance club.

1226
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,700
I want to be with these girls.

1227
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,800
She knew the DJ.

1228
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,330
We get up these steps were in
this private area behind the DJ.

1229
00:33:32,331 --> 00:33:33,560
No one can see us,

1230
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:34,820
the Djs like 10,

1231
00:33:34,821 --> 00:33:35,770
15 feet in front of it,

1232
00:33:35,771 --> 00:33:39,380
just like jamming and the place is
packed downstairs but you can't see them.

1233
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:44,030
And we got this horse shoe leather couch
and we're just racking and she's got

1234
00:33:44,031 --> 00:33:47,690
more bottles of Pinot Grigio on ice and
we're just fucking dancing and grinding

1235
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:48,524
on each other.

1236
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:53,150
And we go back to my apartment and
about five o'clock in the morning,

1237
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:53,931
something like that.

1238
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:54,051
And,

1239
00:33:54,051 --> 00:33:54,201
you know,

1240
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:56,630
we dance on my furniture and
we'll play music and stuff.

1241
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,980
And we got in my bed and
honestly there was no sex.

1242
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,433
Uh,

1243
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:07,810
we had our bottoms underwear on and
it was so tender and just resting and

1244
00:34:08,871 --> 00:34:13,790
kissing and tasting of fleshing
and touching of private areas.

1245
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,020
And the,

1246
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:21,310
at one point the queen bee got up on
her knees and she starts French kissing

1247
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:24,740
this other girl and
she's rubbing her mound.

1248
00:34:24,741 --> 00:34:24,911
What?

1249
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:25,760
She's just kissing her.

1250
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,440
And I got behind this,

1251
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:28,560
uh,

1252
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,560
behind the Queen Bee and I just start
kissing this big beautiful brown bulbous

1253
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:34,910
acid.

1254
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:35,743
Mm hmm.

1255
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,710
I got my hands up on the top curvature
of it and I pulled her panties aside,

1256
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,290
them stuck my nose in her honey pot and
I'm just tasting these delicious flesh

1257
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,830
rose petals and um,

1258
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,730
I overslept and I missed the Dalai Lama's.

1259
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,010
You when

1260
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,993
you win,

1261
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,833
why would you,

1262
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,810
why would you even think that
that would be a bad thing?

1263
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,910
The Dalai Lama joke,

1264
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,553
it's a true story,

1265
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,060
but it's not a joke.

1266
00:35:08,061 --> 00:35:09,410
It's actually a true story story.

1267
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,630
The Dalai Lama represents a,

1268
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,460
an interesting point
of view and that's it.

1269
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:17,780
You know the idea that this guys you guys
guy for to find out what happiness is,

1270
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:18,850
the eye,

1271
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,840
it's the idea of a one,

1272
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:26,170
a one figurehead like that is kind of
preposterous to the idea of enlightenment.

1273
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:27,044
The idea,

1274
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,290
especially if you're dealing with a guy
who dresses like a wizard and doesn't

1275
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:31,124
fuck,

1276
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,630
he doesn't get to have sex.

1277
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:33,770
He's never had sex.

1278
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,060
I mean he could if he wanted to,

1279
00:35:35,061 --> 00:35:36,600
but he thinks that it complicates that.

1280
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,320
I feel bad the Dalai Lama because

1281
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,150
Richard Gere always
wants to hang out with,

1282
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,600
you can see the Dalai Lama like a
pulling Richard Gere aside one day going,

1283
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:47,740
hey Richard,

1284
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,780
you ever considered Scientology?

1285
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:50,740
Whatever.

1286
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:55,060
I had to imagine the conversations the
Dalai Lama must have with like Sharon

1287
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:55,871
Stone or he's like,

1288
00:35:55,871 --> 00:35:56,704
yeah,

1289
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:57,131
yeah,

1290
00:35:57,131 --> 00:35:58,690
I can't believe they chose her either.

1291
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,030
Yeah,

1292
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,863
I mean,

1293
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,650
yeah,

1294
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,450
I mean,

1295
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:01,810
look,

1296
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:02,643
yes,

1297
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,121
a lot of movies,

1298
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:06,070
but you're amazing and base against tank.

1299
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,270
I thought you were amazing and the,

1300
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,430
they didn't think you could
pull it off in the second one.

1301
00:36:09,431 --> 00:36:10,570
You pulled it off in the second one.

1302
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,760
Did you see this basic instinct too?

1303
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,320
It's a horror movie.

1304
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,360
It changed from,

1305
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,750
it changed from an erotic film
when Sharon Stone was young too.

1306
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,180
Uh,

1307
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:19,820
like uh,

1308
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,280
like a panic moment.

1309
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,100
Solid.

1310
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,781
Yeah.

1311
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:23,171
Fuck yeah,

1312
00:36:23,171 --> 00:36:24,004
I did Sun.

1313
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,220
I'm a diligent worker when it comes to
watching stupid shit that I might be able

1314
00:36:27,221 --> 00:36:27,850
to make fun of.

1315
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:28,361
She's in it.

1316
00:36:28,361 --> 00:36:29,194
Right?

1317
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,260
But she was like 50 and I'm not joking.

1318
00:36:32,261 --> 00:36:33,700
She show anything like that nipple,

1319
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,780
the whole leg thing.

1320
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:38,960
But there's a feeling that you get when
a 50 year old woman who's trying like

1321
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,570
really hard to be sexy.

1322
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,760
Like I dunno if she was
directed in that way,

1323
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:46,180
but when you're 50 you
realize by the time you 50,

1324
00:36:46,181 --> 00:36:47,740
he realize it's mostly all bullshit.

1325
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:48,190
Okay,

1326
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,023
what are we doing here?

1327
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:49,600
You know,

1328
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,420
if we're going to fuck,

1329
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,100
we're going to fuck.

1330
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,760
But all of this like sultry shit that
you might get away with when you're 20.

1331
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:55,860
It's because you,

1332
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,180
you're,

1333
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,480
you're a a spell when you're 20.

1334
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,610
When a woman is in her young twenties.

1335
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,910
She the reason why they have
this idea of themselves,

1336
00:37:03,911 --> 00:37:08,890
it's so inflated like really beautiful
girls is because they're like magic.

1337
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,640
Like you were around them and
get like your mood changes,

1338
00:37:12,641 --> 00:37:14,500
you draw towards them,

1339
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:18,160
you soften your personality though
or were pick it up or whatever.

1340
00:37:18,161 --> 00:37:20,230
You need to get me the
lucky a little bit more.

1341
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,970
It's like a drug.

1342
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,760
It's like a fascinating orotic draw.

1343
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,940
But then when they get 50 and
they're still doing the same thing,

1344
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:28,930
then it's like,

1345
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,040
oh shit,

1346
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:30,940
what's wrong with her?

1347
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,170
Oh fuck.

1348
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,620
So when you see across her leg,

1349
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:38,560
just like the real moment of panic where
I would think about me in my younger

1350
00:37:38,561 --> 00:37:38,921
days,

1351
00:37:38,921 --> 00:37:40,030
if I was in that scenario,

1352
00:37:40,031 --> 00:37:40,390
I would,

1353
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:40,961
I would say,

1354
00:37:40,961 --> 00:37:41,291
okay,

1355
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:43,390
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.

1356
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:44,440
It was that moment,

1357
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:48,580
50 year old lady shows you her gapper
and then closes the legs over and you're

1358
00:37:48,581 --> 00:37:48,760
like,

1359
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,550
nope,

1360
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,390
got gotta go right now I am going right.

1361
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,420
That is not the way
like a healthy sexually,

1362
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,111
you know,

1363
00:37:56,111 --> 00:37:58,960
confident 50 year old
woman would would fuck you.

1364
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,090
I can't believe they
just had her do it again.

1365
00:38:01,091 --> 00:38:03,460
That's so lame and seeing over two lanes.

1366
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:04,260
Oh,

1367
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:04,701
sorry.

1368
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,200
It was so unnecessary,

1369
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,010
you know,

1370
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:07,291
I mean,

1371
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:09,670
what's Hollywood unnecessary ideas?

1372
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,703
Well,

1373
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:11,651
well,

1374
00:38:11,651 --> 00:38:15,220
I think it's like someone who's never
done standing up trying to craft a joke on

1375
00:38:15,221 --> 00:38:16,054
this is going to work.

1376
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:16,630
You know,

1377
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,340
you don't really have a chance to vet it.

1378
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,030
You just have to put it out there as
a movie and hope that people get it.

1379
00:38:22,031 --> 00:38:25,570
And the first basic jeans to
instinct was really fucking,

1380
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,261
you know,

1381
00:38:26,261 --> 00:38:27,490
it was well received.

1382
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,990
It wasn't the best movie in the world,

1383
00:38:28,991 --> 00:38:29,890
but it was kinda fun.

1384
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:30,521
It's,

1385
00:38:30,521 --> 00:38:31,090
you know,

1386
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,260
it's took your,

1387
00:38:32,261 --> 00:38:34,150
your interest and she's sexy as fuck,

1388
00:38:34,151 --> 00:38:34,920
man.

1389
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,180
Old Sharon Stone

1390
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,120
is sexy as fuck that we'll
miss suck structurally.

1391
00:38:39,121 --> 00:38:39,840
Perfect,

1392
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,381
beautiful,

1393
00:38:40,381 --> 00:38:42,570
beautiful woman and a powerful actress.

1394
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:43,981
But when you're 50,

1395
00:38:43,981 --> 00:38:44,211
keep,

1396
00:38:44,211 --> 00:38:45,180
keep your gabber shut.

1397
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,313
What else did she do?

1398
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,131
She didn't,

1399
00:38:47,131 --> 00:38:48,630
she didn't done anything lately.

1400
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,440
I don't know.

1401
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,273
She does liver,

1402
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,360
liver,

1403
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,193
liver.

1404
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,180
That was quite awhile ago.

1405
00:38:53,181 --> 00:38:57,080
I think she did that one thing where
they were interviewing her about,

1406
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,800
uh,

1407
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,240
the earthquake in China.

1408
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,510
And she said that she believed,

1409
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,301
she said,

1410
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:07,070
well maybe it's Karma for what they do
to Tibet cause I'm friends with the Dalai

1411
00:39:07,071 --> 00:39:07,460
Lama's,

1412
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,293
my friend.

1413
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:11,570
And it's like she had to apologize for it.

1414
00:39:11,571 --> 00:39:15,140
I think it cost her like one of
her perfume things or something.

1415
00:39:15,141 --> 00:39:19,340
But that's just such a crazy way of
thinking that a bunch of random strangers

1416
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,233
that did it.

1417
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,360
Huge March man.

1418
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,650
That's a huge market.

1419
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:23,760
You go over there and it's funny,

1420
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:24,420
you go to Europe,

1421
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:29,420
you go to China and you see like huge
actors that are doing commercials but they

1422
00:39:29,641 --> 00:39:30,870
would never do in the states.

1423
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:31,261
Japan,

1424
00:39:31,261 --> 00:39:31,800
right.

1425
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,850
Pick Japan also.

1426
00:39:32,851 --> 00:39:34,400
But China and uh,

1427
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,230
what Deniros like on some
coffee thing in Italy,

1428
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,693
Robert Deniro,

1429
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,330
he's a like symbol of this.

1430
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,510
Some little espresso.

1431
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,920
That's hilarious.

1432
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:44,963
Wow.

1433
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,870
That's so weird.

1434
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:46,950
Yeah.

1435
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:51,360
Well I think it's just like Leonardo
Dicaprio does commercials and like Japan

1436
00:39:51,361 --> 00:39:52,194
and

1437
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,050
I think,

1438
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,420
I don't believe that you
should take anybody's getaway.

1439
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,080
If they fuck up and say something stupid,

1440
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:01,280
people can be ultimately say back the
truck up and grabbed the money baby.

1441
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,460
Cause they said something stupid.

1442
00:40:04,461 --> 00:40:04,850
I mean,

1443
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:05,960
she said a stupid thing.

1444
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,200
She probably didn't mean it.

1445
00:40:07,201 --> 00:40:10,550
It's probably didn't realize how
fast your heads so far up in her ass.

1446
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,730
And she had her little buddy,

1447
00:40:13,731 --> 00:40:14,570
the Dalai Lama,

1448
00:40:14,571 --> 00:40:17,230
to be impressed that she
stood up to mean China.

1449
00:40:17,231 --> 00:40:18,440
China is awesome.

1450
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,140
Just stupid is a really cool place,

1451
00:40:21,141 --> 00:40:21,500
man.

1452
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:21,621
Well,

1453
00:40:21,621 --> 00:40:22,970
I'm sure China is awesome.

1454
00:40:22,971 --> 00:40:23,661
I haven't been,

1455
00:40:23,661 --> 00:40:25,100
but these are just people.

1456
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,690
There's people that died in an earthquake.

1457
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,270
It's Karma because we massive too.

1458
00:40:29,271 --> 00:40:29,871
It's like saying,

1459
00:40:29,871 --> 00:40:30,380
you know what I mean?

1460
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:30,561
Look,

1461
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,330
the United States is a massive place.

1462
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:32,780
Like,

1463
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,320
you know,

1464
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,230
something happens somewhere.

1465
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,064
It's just,

1466
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:35,760
you know,

1467
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,260
uh,

1468
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,120
we're a big landmass it China.

1469
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:38,791
Well,

1470
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:39,320
it's,

1471
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,051
and again,

1472
00:40:40,051 --> 00:40:43,350
it's the people who died didn't have
anything to do with anything that happened

1473
00:40:43,351 --> 00:40:43,921
to Tibet.

1474
00:40:43,921 --> 00:40:45,300
So how the fuck is it Karma?

1475
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:45,840
It's,

1476
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,501
are you saying,

1477
00:40:46,501 --> 00:40:50,130
is that in your vision that the
emperor is the overlord and you know,

1478
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:53,280
he really does have all the people
under his spell and they're,

1479
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:55,010
they're responsible for his actions as

1480
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:55,610
well.

1481
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,020
Because these are just regular folks.

1482
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:01,520
I was just in New Zealand and
the Dalai Lama is coming there.

1483
00:41:01,521 --> 00:41:01,790
He's,

1484
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,170
I think he's there right now.

1485
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,530
Does he knows where that road is?

1486
00:41:04,531 --> 00:41:05,211
Doing a little toy.

1487
00:41:05,211 --> 00:41:05,361
Yeah,

1488
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:05,750
he does.

1489
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:06,800
He's doing a little tour,

1490
00:41:06,801 --> 00:41:10,010
but he wears them a red
lace lingerie underneath it.

1491
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,300
Um,

1492
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,740
he's hotlist still in like Auckland and
Christchurch and Dun Eden and it's the

1493
00:41:15,741 --> 00:41:16,760
happiness thing.

1494
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,470
So I mean that was when I,

1495
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,940
that was like 99 when my story happened.

1496
00:41:20,941 --> 00:41:23,120
So that guy still doing the same act,

1497
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,810
pushing that happiness show work.

1498
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,673
Nobody's happy.

1499
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,680
He's saying the way to be happy as a
dress like a wizard and don't fuck,

1500
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,583
I'm not buying,

1501
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:33,783
buying it.

1502
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:34,721
We get head.

1503
00:41:34,721 --> 00:41:35,554
I guess.

1504
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,890
It's just seems like you're wasting it.

1505
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,070
I Get a light saber.

1506
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,970
I'm not wearing the robe.

1507
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:43,000
It seems like you would want
someone to make love to,

1508
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,660
whether it's a man or a woman would
want someone gets cold at nights,

1509
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,910
but it's also fun.

1510
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,060
It's a part of life.

1511
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:52,690
It's a part of life is expressing
affection through your body feels good.

1512
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,411
You know,

1513
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:55,090
it's recreational as well.

1514
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:55,601
You know,

1515
00:41:55,601 --> 00:41:56,350
you're going to exercise.

1516
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,400
It's great when people say,

1517
00:41:57,401 --> 00:41:58,234
well,

1518
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,481
you know,

1519
00:41:58,481 --> 00:41:59,790
recreational sex isn't healthy.

1520
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,300
We can have recreational sex.

1521
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,140
You can.

1522
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:02,560
You can.

1523
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,370
It can be done.

1524
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:04,600
People have done it forever.

1525
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,700
It's shut up just because
you can't handle it.

1526
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:07,870
People have,

1527
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:08,690
it's not,

1528
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,660
it's just touching bodies together

1529
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:11,891
better.

1530
00:42:11,891 --> 00:42:12,820
When you get older though,

1531
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:13,331
like dude,

1532
00:42:13,331 --> 00:42:14,164
the girls finally go,

1533
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:14,610
Oh yeah,

1534
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,270
we could just have casual sex.

1535
00:42:16,271 --> 00:42:16,601
You know,

1536
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:18,320
I'm 35 again.

1537
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,183
The American women,

1538
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,450
women in different countries
have different heads,

1539
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,330
completely different
attitudes and it's shocking.

1540
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,500
It's shocking.

1541
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:26,431
You go to,

1542
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,711
you know,

1543
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:27,990
you in European countries,

1544
00:42:27,991 --> 00:42:29,160
they're so likable,

1545
00:42:29,161 --> 00:42:30,570
like much more like man,

1546
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,210
like man,

1547
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,110
they fucked like men.

1548
00:42:32,111 --> 00:42:33,610
Like they want to do it all the time too.

1549
00:42:33,611 --> 00:42:34,960
It was like a lot of American women.

1550
00:42:34,961 --> 00:42:35,430
It's like,

1551
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:35,590
oh,

1552
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:38,120
I'm going to break him off a
piece every once in a while.

1553
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:38,800
I like it.

1554
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,210
I like their dog treats or something.

1555
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:40,481
Okay,

1556
00:42:40,481 --> 00:42:42,100
here's a guy you did good.

1557
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:45,940
You know you've washed the cars and
take out the trash and cut the grass.

1558
00:42:45,941 --> 00:42:46,121
All right,

1559
00:42:46,121 --> 00:42:46,700
here's,

1560
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,130
here's your dog treat man.

1561
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:48,964
I'm euro trash.

1562
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,150
So weak.

1563
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:52,480
I just think

1564
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,040
did,

1565
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,140
it's probably because the
people that came over here,

1566
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,870
like the very first wave periods there.

1567
00:42:58,871 --> 00:42:59,261
Yeah.

1568
00:42:59,261 --> 00:43:00,270
And I think that that,

1569
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,200
that initial run,

1570
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:06,340
that initial thing that started off
this country somehow or another,

1571
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:10,810
a fiber of it's still fucking sticks
and there's a lot of slut shaming and

1572
00:43:10,811 --> 00:43:11,920
there's a lot of like weak,

1573
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:16,950
angry people that are like pointing
fingers and shaming someone for enjoying

1574
00:43:17,081 --> 00:43:18,040
something a day.

1575
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:19,030
Enjoy as well.

1576
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:19,511
You know,

1577
00:43:19,511 --> 00:43:20,470
like slut shaming.

1578
00:43:20,471 --> 00:43:21,304
That's the,

1579
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,260
that is all Douche bags.

1580
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,850
Any guy that like you like rails on a
girl because she wants her exact term slut

1581
00:43:27,851 --> 00:43:28,520
shaming.

1582
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:28,810
Yeah,

1583
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:29,080
man.

1584
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:29,891
That's what it is.

1585
00:43:29,891 --> 00:43:31,660
It's like a guy's a stud.

1586
00:43:31,661 --> 00:43:32,580
If he goes out here,

1587
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,200
we went out to King Kune.

1588
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,980
We had sex with two different girls,

1589
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:37,120
different girls every day.

1590
00:43:37,121 --> 00:43:37,954
It was crazy.

1591
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:38,381
Wow.

1592
00:43:38,381 --> 00:43:40,060
My guts and nuttiest weekend ever.

1593
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:42,940
But if a girl tells you she fuck
two different guys for a week,

1594
00:43:42,941 --> 00:43:44,350
you below can a fucking whore.

1595
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,580
He probably gonna get aids.

1596
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:46,810
You gotta give it to my brother.

1597
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,310
Oh fuck you bitch.

1598
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,081
You know what I mean?

1599
00:43:50,081 --> 00:43:50,891
It's like it's,

1600
00:43:50,891 --> 00:43:51,200
it's,

1601
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,210
it's ridiculous.

1602
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,870
People should be able to deal with
ever the fuck they want to do.

1603
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,200
But so for some women they know that
that backlash and not just from,

1604
00:43:59,230 --> 00:43:59,711
from men,

1605
00:43:59,711 --> 00:44:03,250
but that backlash from women too because
if women are out there giving it up,

1606
00:44:03,251 --> 00:44:03,461
you know,

1607
00:44:03,461 --> 00:44:04,380
like that's fucking horse.

1608
00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:05,470
She'll just fuck anybody,

1609
00:44:05,471 --> 00:44:06,020
you know.

1610
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,510
She's never going to get fucking married
cause she just fuck salary money.

1611
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,660
Those kind of women had to
make the world go round.

1612
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,620
They do.

1613
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,311
You need them all right.

1614
00:44:12,311 --> 00:44:13,510
They keep a lot of guys happy.

1615
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,171
Well you don't,

1616
00:44:14,171 --> 00:44:15,004
so you need,

1617
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,260
I think that would be a lot of that.

1618
00:44:16,261 --> 00:44:18,460
A lot less savage killers and,

1619
00:44:18,461 --> 00:44:20,580
and a fucking lunatics in this country.

1620
00:44:20,581 --> 00:44:23,370
If you know a women were fucking more,

1621
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:24,131
you know,

1622
00:44:24,131 --> 00:44:24,930
these are dudes,

1623
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:25,211
you know,

1624
00:44:25,211 --> 00:44:25,951
what would help a lot.

1625
00:44:25,951 --> 00:44:26,370
Just a little,

1626
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,203
just a little more,

1627
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:27,810
you know,

1628
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:28,980
legalized floods in general.

1629
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:29,910
There you guys,

1630
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:30,930
prostitution would help a,

1631
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,220
I think [inaudible]

1632
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:32,760
pos.

1633
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,700
If you managed legalize prostitution,

1634
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,410
I think it probably lower the crime rate.

1635
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:38,190
I really do.

1636
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,330
I mean it's theoretical.

1637
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:41,250
Don't go like fucking
citing me as a study.

1638
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:42,930
Holland does it and the,

1639
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:45,930
the women have to be tested
every like six months and it's a,

1640
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,300
they pay taxes as well.

1641
00:44:47,301 --> 00:44:47,631
It's,

1642
00:44:47,631 --> 00:44:48,130
you know,

1643
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:53,130
did you see those two women that were
retiring than it fucked for like 50 years?

1644
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,353
When was that?

1645
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,700
Did you see that?

1646
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,860
Oh my God.

1647
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:57,460
Hello?

1648
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:57,730
Yeah,

1649
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:58,300
yeah,

1650
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,133
yeah.

1651
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:01,710
I didn't want to shame them
so let's not show their,

1652
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:02,421
for their images.

1653
00:45:02,421 --> 00:45:02,931
But the,

1654
00:45:02,931 --> 00:45:03,240
anyway,

1655
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,073
the point of news item,

1656
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,150
it was so depressing.

1657
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,600
They just fucked anybody who
came through the door for like

1658
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,460
50 years.

1659
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:11,310
The Amsterdam girls are twin sisters.

1660
00:45:11,311 --> 00:45:12,300
They just retired.

1661
00:45:12,301 --> 00:45:15,240
They just sat in the window for like
the last 50 years that their oldest

1662
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,590
prostitutes and answer,

1663
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,220
how's a Wowza?

1664
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:19,790
Yeah,

1665
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:21,400
it's a different week.

1666
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:26,850
I think we have to recognize
that we have a version of how,

1667
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,820
how society is,

1668
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:29,331
but the,

1669
00:45:29,331 --> 00:45:30,260
the rest of the world,

1670
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:35,000
which is also exactly like
us as far as like technology,

1671
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:36,230
civilization,

1672
00:45:36,231 --> 00:45:36,801
laws,

1673
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:37,221
money,

1674
00:45:37,221 --> 00:45:38,054
exact them.

1675
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,250
I mean basically you're,

1676
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:39,921
you're in Europe.

1677
00:45:39,921 --> 00:45:41,060
Their systems are different,

1678
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:41,601
you know,

1679
00:45:41,601 --> 00:45:41,741
the,

1680
00:45:41,741 --> 00:45:43,040
the languages are different,

1681
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:44,240
but everything is modern.

1682
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:44,841
You know,

1683
00:45:44,841 --> 00:45:45,590
if you're in,

1684
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:47,930
if you're in Montreal,

1685
00:45:47,931 --> 00:45:49,970
Canada or if you're in Berlin,

1686
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,950
everything is super modern right now.

1687
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:52,461
There's only,

1688
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:57,461
it's everything is like we live in a
time where like there's never been like

1689
00:45:59,211 --> 00:46:02,430
more equality as far as like uh,

1690
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,380
access to information.

1691
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:03,841
Right.

1692
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:04,141
We all,

1693
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:05,370
we all have the same tools.

1694
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:05,840
I mean if you have,

1695
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,340
if you can afford some
certain basic things,

1696
00:46:08,341 --> 00:46:08,520
you know,

1697
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,353
computer

1698
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:10,221
yeah.

1699
00:46:10,221 --> 00:46:11,930
As far as like in information.

1700
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:13,610
But as far as money,

1701
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,460
it's probably like the widest gap ever.

1702
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,290
Isn't that weird?

1703
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,660
It's like as far as money,

1704
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:23,650
like there's like a small
core group like the,

1705
00:46:23,651 --> 00:46:27,410
well you know when they call them one
percenters who have most of the money and

1706
00:46:27,411 --> 00:46:28,400
then everybody else.

1707
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,660
That's kind of fascinating.

1708
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:34,490
You would think that maybe
eventually that trend will even out,

1709
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,753
you know,

1710
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,600
cause it seems like the only
way if you looked at it,

1711
00:46:38,601 --> 00:46:39,650
and this is obviously not,

1712
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:44,710
not looking at the system logically or
even educated with an educated opinion of

1713
00:46:44,751 --> 00:46:45,740
this financial system.

1714
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:49,940
But if you looked at it logically
and you step back and you saw,

1715
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:50,180
well,

1716
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:50,870
okay,

1717
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:53,900
this 1% has all this money,

1718
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:56,300
but how much access to
information is there?

1719
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:56,511
Oh,

1720
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,760
it's not totally transparent yet.

1721
00:46:59,030 --> 00:46:59,650
Hm.

1722
00:46:59,650 --> 00:46:59,780
Well,

1723
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,130
when it becomes transparent,

1724
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:06,370
these 99% are going to realize how these
1% got so much fucking money and they

1725
00:47:07,351 --> 00:47:07,850
got to go,

1726
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:08,241
wow,

1727
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:09,530
you can't do that.

1728
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:10,940
And then everyone's going to agree.

1729
00:47:10,941 --> 00:47:11,031
Yeah,

1730
00:47:11,031 --> 00:47:11,691
they can't do that.

1731
00:47:11,691 --> 00:47:11,930
Right?

1732
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:12,201
No,

1733
00:47:12,201 --> 00:47:13,160
they can't do that.

1734
00:47:13,161 --> 00:47:15,290
Jesus fucking Christ who let them do that.

1735
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:19,490
That's when there's 100% accountability
when you're going to be able to beat

1736
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:20,420
you.

1737
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:20,991
Absolutely.

1738
00:47:20,991 --> 00:47:21,770
Sure.

1739
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,420
What someone has and hasn't done.

1740
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,373
That's common.

1741
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,340
You think so?

1742
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,310
I don't think they'll ever be that
transparency where you can see that,

1743
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,980
I think workings of the

1744
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,420
1% I think it's gonna.

1745
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:32,110
I think,

1746
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:32,771
I think they've got,

1747
00:47:32,771 --> 00:47:33,940
they've mastered the game.

1748
00:47:33,941 --> 00:47:34,360
They got,

1749
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:34,601
you know,

1750
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,880
the houses in Switzerland or
wherever the fuck they live.

1751
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:37,390
And,

1752
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:40,730
but I think technology is
the biggest fear to that.

1753
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:43,570
The big arrive on the
building on a helicopter pad.

1754
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:44,583
You don't have to,

1755
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:45,460
you know,

1756
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,860
even being in an elevator
with the underclasses,

1757
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:51,070
but what I'm saying is I don't think
they're going to be able to maintain it

1758
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:52,170
anymore because like where's,

1759
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,080
where's your money?

1760
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:53,930
Where is it?

1761
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,810
Zero zero box so you can go to,

1762
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:56,561
no,

1763
00:47:56,561 --> 00:47:57,940
it's all ones and Zeros.

1764
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,050
I'm computers now.

1765
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,690
Your money is essentially
just a confidence game.

1766
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,280
It's like what do you have to you?

1767
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,840
The things that you
bought with that money,

1768
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:09,970
but that money's just like set sitting
somewhere like it's either in stacked in

1769
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:10,804
bills,

1770
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:12,760
which is equally brie weird.

1771
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,760
You do a bunch of notes and that's it.

1772
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:15,311
That's your mind.

1773
00:48:15,311 --> 00:48:17,170
What happens to the burns
need to have nothing.

1774
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:18,491
What did what,

1775
00:48:18,491 --> 00:48:19,570
where's the value?

1776
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,411
Like what is this?

1777
00:48:20,411 --> 00:48:21,590
You can't replace them.

1778
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:21,761
Say,

1779
00:48:21,761 --> 00:48:21,911
Hey,

1780
00:48:21,911 --> 00:48:23,290
I burnt my 1 million notes.

1781
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:24,250
Can you give me a new notes?

1782
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:27,370
You don't have them numbered off like
a fucking hotel key that you lose.

1783
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:32,980
You don't have a scrooge duck room where
you roll around and your gold coins.

1784
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:39,650
If I was Joe Rogan perfect
a room just a little bit,

1785
00:48:39,651 --> 00:48:39,840
you know,

1786
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,550
just a couple of grand
you could go roll around,

1787
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:43,780
make it rain on yourself.

1788
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:46,600
I think the more information comes out,

1789
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,190
the more access,

1790
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:51,610
the more control the average
person has over their own domain,

1791
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:56,820
the less likely you're going to have 1%
of the people with most of the wealth

1792
00:48:58,010 --> 00:48:59,050
doesn't make any sense.

1793
00:48:59,510 --> 00:48:59,801
Does it?

1794
00:48:59,801 --> 00:49:02,890
Seems like that's not how
the people would let it be.

1795
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:06,040
They'd figure out a way around that
like that seems like that's obviously

1796
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:09,430
someone's exploited the system and
they've made it a non unfair competition.

1797
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:12,490
Like this isn't like an
even exchange anymore.

1798
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:16,480
You're getting this insane amount of
revenue as opposed to the rest of the

1799
00:49:16,481 --> 00:49:17,290
population.

1800
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:22,290
If you look at it like this massive group
of bankers and Destria it's like well

1801
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,250
this is an insane amount of money.

1802
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,900
There's only 50 you fuck heads.

1803
00:49:25,901 --> 00:49:29,920
Like hold on and you all partied together
and wife swap and you have fucking key

1804
00:49:29,921 --> 00:49:30,790
parties and shit.

1805
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,440
They're like air force pilots.

1806
00:49:32,441 --> 00:49:32,741
They're out.

1807
00:49:32,741 --> 00:49:35,710
They're just flying until
they run out of gas.

1808
00:49:35,711 --> 00:49:37,240
Going full gangster.

1809
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,740
Making billions like that.

1810
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:41,460
Bernie Madoff cock sucker when they,

1811
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,870
within the snag that fighter pilots,

1812
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,240
they're like fucking full games runs out.

1813
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,830
They know that as soon as like there's
some wiki leaks for the whole world and

1814
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:54,670
we as soon as everything like it's full
100% transparency and then ultimately

1815
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:56,680
voting on the Internet that's
going to kill them all.

1816
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,680
One world government
voting on the Internet,

1817
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,090
one when no government
voting on the Internet,

1818
00:50:01,091 --> 00:50:03,730
it's going to be where it's at because
it's going to get to a point where people

1819
00:50:03,731 --> 00:50:06,970
are going to realize that they're in
in order to keep everybody from being

1820
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:07,301
crazy,

1821
00:50:07,301 --> 00:50:09,760
there has to be a balance
and until you bounce it out,

1822
00:50:09,761 --> 00:50:12,060
people are going to be crazy
because he's going to be an equity.

1823
00:50:12,061 --> 00:50:14,950
You just going to be people that are
eating fucking dirt sandwiches and then

1824
00:50:14,951 --> 00:50:17,620
people that have thrown and half their
food away because they're lazy and fat

1825
00:50:17,621 --> 00:50:20,770
and they just take for granted that their
foods at the store in the morning when

1826
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:24,760
they get up and I think that that until
until you get that balance is out.

1827
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:26,230
There's always going to be some chaos.

1828
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,670
There's always that to like,

1829
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:28,090
and the

1830
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:32,140
only way that's going to balance out
is if everybody has free access to

1831
00:50:32,141 --> 00:50:32,950
resources.

1832
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:34,540
It's like a non capitalist idea.

1833
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:39,520
It's a stupid idea because the reason why
capitalism works is because it rewards

1834
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,890
effort and effort is what creates things.

1835
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:42,401
You know,

1836
00:50:42,401 --> 00:50:43,270
the harder you work,

1837
00:50:43,271 --> 00:50:44,470
the more reward you get,

1838
00:50:44,471 --> 00:50:45,610
the more you become a baller.

1839
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:47,770
But the problem is a lot
of those ballers they go,

1840
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,220
hmm,

1841
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,320
I like working but I don't
like working this hard.

1842
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:51,760
How about if I just rig this thing?

1843
00:50:51,761 --> 00:50:55,360
So it just continues to make me money
even though it doesn't make any sense and

1844
00:50:55,361 --> 00:50:56,860
no one's gonna say anything
cause I'm the rich guy.

1845
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:57,160
Randy,

1846
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,530
you go and that's basically
what the fuck happened.

1847
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,000
It has to be rectified.

1848
00:51:01,001 --> 00:51:01,780
That has to be,

1849
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:05,130
we have to be put in
a situation where our,

1850
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:05,710
our,

1851
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:07,480
the way we conduct our lives,

1852
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,000
whether it's finance or
government or just behavior,

1853
00:51:10,001 --> 00:51:11,010
the way we communicate with each other,

1854
00:51:11,011 --> 00:51:16,011
it makes sense for the information that
we have in front of us in 2013 and the

1855
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:16,871
fucking,

1856
00:51:16,871 --> 00:51:20,710
the stock market does not make sense with
the information that we have in front

1857
00:51:20,711 --> 00:51:20,890
of us.

1858
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:24,700
In 2013 it looks like
a crazy chaotic ride.

1859
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,780
People screaming at each other on the
floor and it's going up and down and a

1860
00:51:28,781 --> 00:51:30,520
buzzer when rings off.

1861
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:34,810
You've got to stop the trades at a
certain time like what the fuck are you

1862
00:51:34,811 --> 00:51:35,644
doing?

1863
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:36,461
What are you doing?

1864
00:51:36,461 --> 00:51:40,860
Hollering and writing shit down and
throwing paper at each other and screen.

1865
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:41,950
What is the system?

1866
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:42,631
What do you,

1867
00:51:42,631 --> 00:51:45,040
are you manipulating it or
you're calling it as it happens?

1868
00:51:45,041 --> 00:51:45,880
What's it based on?

1869
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,620
Is it based on anything tangible?

1870
00:51:47,621 --> 00:51:48,580
Is it just confidence?

1871
00:51:48,581 --> 00:51:49,180
Is it just,

1872
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:52,360
can you get a bad rumor out there and
crash your stock and then everybody loses?

1873
00:51:52,361 --> 00:51:54,190
What the fuck did you lose?

1874
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:55,420
What was out there.

1875
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:56,370
That's a

1876
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:58,180
right and our whole system is tied to it.

1877
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,990
Guys have a bad day and we all go in the
toilet and I know there's people like

1878
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:04,000
you don't understand the financial system.

1879
00:52:04,001 --> 00:52:05,830
And that's their ignorance
that you show on the show.

1880
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,850
It was disgusting.

1881
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:08,640
I'm so fucking tired
of your pseudo science,

1882
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:09,850
right?

1883
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:10,331
You're right.

1884
00:52:10,331 --> 00:52:11,350
You're right on all accounts.

1885
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,720
Wall Street always reminds
me of the Middle East.

1886
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:16,900
It's always a bunch of unshaven assholes
yelling at the top of their lungs.

1887
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,770
I had some friends from back in
Boston that went into stock markets.

1888
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,520
They went into doing that and it's uh,

1889
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:26,220
they were,

1890
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,270
they were savages,

1891
00:52:27,271 --> 00:52:27,660
man.

1892
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:30,990
They were like crazy
adrenaline junkie savages.

1893
00:52:30,991 --> 00:52:33,360
And they wound up being
the stock market guys.

1894
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,471
They wound up being,

1895
00:52:34,471 --> 00:52:35,250
uh,

1896
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,920
being dudes on the floor
screaming and yelling.

1897
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:38,670
What is it called?

1898
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:39,271
An agent.

1899
00:52:39,271 --> 00:52:39,751
What is it called?

1900
00:52:39,751 --> 00:52:40,584
What do they call them?

1901
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,880
A floor dude.

1902
00:52:41,881 --> 00:52:43,370
What do they call the dorks?

1903
00:52:43,371 --> 00:52:44,560
Traders know a trader.

1904
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:45,394
It's trader trader.

1905
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,250
The guys on the floor with the pets.

1906
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:48,540
It's crazy system.

1907
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:49,463
I don't understand it,

1908
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:51,120
but where I lived around Wall Street,

1909
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:51,501
those,

1910
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:51,901
those a lot,

1911
00:52:51,901 --> 00:52:54,880
a lot of little late night diary
with bars all around and all this,

1912
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,210
they're all down there.

1913
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:01,700
When I was there a system that that
could be created where money made sense,

1914
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,950
where like the finances made sense.

1915
00:53:03,951 --> 00:53:04,610
Where like,

1916
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:07,040
I guess like as soon as
the company goes public,

1917
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:08,420
like just that alone,

1918
00:53:08,421 --> 00:53:11,960
the ability to buy stock in a company
and bank that the company does well,

1919
00:53:11,961 --> 00:53:13,190
and if it does well your profit,

1920
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,300
if it doesn't go well,

1921
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:15,800
isn't that gambling?

1922
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:16,551
Is that,

1923
00:53:16,551 --> 00:53:17,660
it seems like gambling to me.

1924
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:18,140
Right?

1925
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:19,300
Is it a kind of gambling?

1926
00:53:19,301 --> 00:53:20,010
It kind of is.

1927
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:20,391
It is,

1928
00:53:20,391 --> 00:53:21,200
right?

1929
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:21,530
Yeah.

1930
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:22,050
How come?

1931
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:22,190
Oh,

1932
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:22,330
hi.

1933
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:23,163
Is that legal?

1934
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:26,080
How can the stock market's like,

1935
00:53:26,081 --> 00:53:26,890
didn't,

1936
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:27,191
okay.

1937
00:53:27,191 --> 00:53:27,640
Like here,

1938
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,870
how about Bernie Madoff?

1939
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,820
Obviously what he did was illegal.

1940
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:31,683
Right?

1941
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:32,560
But like,

1942
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,670
why isn't that like,

1943
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:34,390
do you think he's,

1944
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:35,200
do you think right now,

1945
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,360
every day he's gobbling
balls with his asshole.

1946
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:38,630
Oh,

1947
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:40,000
he got balls.

1948
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,230
Certainly paid the word enough to,

1949
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,093
uh,

1950
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:46,360
you know,

1951
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,770
stakes to the guys who,

1952
00:53:47,771 --> 00:53:48,310
uh,

1953
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:49,330
do you think he gets fucked?

1954
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:49,571
Oh,

1955
00:53:49,571 --> 00:53:51,310
I think he's just getting pounded.

1956
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,640
You fucked a lot of people.

1957
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,190
A lot of people,

1958
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,900
a lot of really wealthy people.

1959
00:53:59,080 --> 00:53:59,741
It's amazing.

1960
00:53:59,741 --> 00:54:00,550
Like children,

1961
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:05,460
some like some like children's
cancer fund or something.

1962
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:06,070
Some,

1963
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:07,950
a few really important charities and shit.

1964
00:54:07,951 --> 00:54:08,090
Yeah,

1965
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:09,990
he had somebody in,

1966
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:12,100
it's connected in that jail then.

1967
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:13,150
Oh yeah.

1968
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:13,331
Oh,

1969
00:54:13,331 --> 00:54:14,650
I'm sure he's,

1970
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,140
he was a real sociopath to that guy.

1971
00:54:17,141 --> 00:54:18,250
Apparently when they arrested him,

1972
00:54:18,251 --> 00:54:19,990
he didn't fucking crack a sweat.

1973
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,650
Nothing like,

1974
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:21,970
Yep.

1975
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:22,270
All right,

1976
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:22,690
let's go.

1977
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:25,500
Like he knew it was coming and then when
they tore apart his business and then

1978
00:54:25,501 --> 00:54:26,380
realize that what he had done,

1979
00:54:26,381 --> 00:54:27,370
he showed no remorse.

1980
00:54:27,371 --> 00:54:28,050
He's like,

1981
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:28,781
I'm hungry.

1982
00:54:28,781 --> 00:54:29,614
I need something to eat.

1983
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:30,101
You know?

1984
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:30,761
Like it was like,

1985
00:54:30,761 --> 00:54:31,240
oh wow.

1986
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:31,960
He was not,

1987
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,890
he slept well.

1988
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:35,080
He never worried about
those people in the,

1989
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:35,840
the,

1990
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,390
the kind of intense,

1991
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:40,480
intense fucking pain that he caused.

1992
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:41,860
All of those people,

1993
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:42,810
he stole money from you.

1994
00:54:42,811 --> 00:54:43,720
They didn't give a fuck.

1995
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:44,690
Well,

1996
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:47,920
he was just a sociopath
just done by this system.

1997
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:49,331
It's amazing.

1998
00:54:49,331 --> 00:54:50,051
Then he pulled it off.

1999
00:54:50,051 --> 00:54:50,884
That's what's amazing.

2000
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:54,820
What's amazing is that the system is
so wonky that a guy can just pretend to

2001
00:54:54,821 --> 00:54:56,470
have money and not really,

2002
00:54:56,471 --> 00:54:58,770
and just fucking do this
weird thing where you're

2003
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:03,380
move shit around card Monte with millions
of dollars with their money and look

2004
00:55:03,381 --> 00:55:04,760
you're which now you're making more money.

2005
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:05,630
That's just incredible.

2006
00:55:05,631 --> 00:55:06,351
I am making more money.

2007
00:55:06,351 --> 00:55:08,000
The more money keep it and
the more money you make,

2008
00:55:08,001 --> 00:55:08,930
I'll just tell you that right now.

2009
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,033
Okay,

2010
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:15,200
I'm the fucking push it all in and so all
of a sudden this asshole disappears on

2011
00:55:15,201 --> 00:55:16,160
you or,

2012
00:55:16,161 --> 00:55:18,110
or winds up on CNN and you're like,

2013
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:20,960
no,

2014
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:21,980
I,

2015
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,690
we were going to play tennis on Thursday.

2016
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,310
You know there had to be at
least one dude who is suspicious.

2017
00:55:28,311 --> 00:55:28,521
Like,

2018
00:55:28,521 --> 00:55:28,731
man,

2019
00:55:28,731 --> 00:55:30,050
I think this dude's a cruck.

2020
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:31,250
They had to be one dude.

2021
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:31,390
But

2022
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:32,290
he was just getting those,

2023
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:33,910
those monthly checks and he's like,

2024
00:55:33,911 --> 00:55:34,721
it looks good.

2025
00:55:34,721 --> 00:55:35,620
Looks good here,

2026
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:37,163
looks good.

2027
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:38,500
Fuck.

2028
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:40,570
It's just looking at those numbers like,

2029
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:40,721
look,

2030
00:55:40,721 --> 00:55:41,501
I'm making money.

2031
00:55:41,501 --> 00:55:42,334
I mean

2032
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:45,370
just as long as I keep my money in play,

2033
00:55:45,371 --> 00:55:46,091
I'm making money.

2034
00:55:46,091 --> 00:55:47,170
I'm just going to honey,

2035
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:47,531
listen,

2036
00:55:47,531 --> 00:55:49,960
if we push all of our life
savings just together,

2037
00:55:49,961 --> 00:55:53,260
we go in for two years as
two out of 25% return rate,

2038
00:55:53,261 --> 00:55:56,890
which was put up in getting
and all of sudden CNN,

2039
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:02,250
that ugly cont walking across the floor
of the courthouse and you'll like,

2040
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,040
no,

2041
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:05,860
he stole it.

2042
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,920
How can that guy get away with that?

2043
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:10,310
How has it,

2044
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:11,450
obviously he didn't get away with it,

2045
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,620
but how did he do it for so long?

2046
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:13,910
What kind of system do you have?

2047
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:14,960
This system is crazy.

2048
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:16,670
You need a new Gundam system.

2049
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:18,953
I agree.

2050
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:19,913
What to do,

2051
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,210
what to do,

2052
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:22,770
Tom Rhodes as a world traveler.

2053
00:56:22,771 --> 00:56:23,530
What do,

2054
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:24,360
because you're the guy,

2055
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,193
what do we do?

2056
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:25,980
You know,

2057
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,120
my thoughts are childish,

2058
00:56:27,121 --> 00:56:27,331
man.

2059
00:56:27,331 --> 00:56:27,631
I think,

2060
00:56:27,631 --> 00:56:27,841
you know,

2061
00:56:27,841 --> 00:56:29,910
the invention of pockets
ruined everything.

2062
00:56:29,911 --> 00:56:32,910
I think we were happy when we were
just naked running around on the beach,

2063
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,920
just eating fruit and fucking,

2064
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:37,380
and then when somebody invented pockets,

2065
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:37,610
hi,

2066
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:39,900
I'm going to look at that
shiny Shell and Oh look,

2067
00:56:39,901 --> 00:56:40,711
a pretty rock.

2068
00:56:40,711 --> 00:56:43,590
And then you start getting all these
objects in your pocket and then you start

2069
00:56:43,591 --> 00:56:44,790
trading with other people.

2070
00:56:44,791 --> 00:56:46,410
And then like somebody invents,

2071
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:46,740
you know,

2072
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,780
paper money and Oh my God,

2073
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:49,614
then you know,

2074
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:50,980
I think you're right.

2075
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:51,840
Fucking pockets.

2076
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:53,670
Pockets ruined everything,

2077
00:56:53,671 --> 00:56:54,490
man.

2078
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:55,181
I think you're right.

2079
00:56:55,181 --> 00:56:57,760
But I also think it's just the stage.

2080
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,380
We just have to get used to this,

2081
00:56:59,610 --> 00:56:59,890
this,

2082
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,270
this level of existence.

2083
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,800
You just have to get used to it.

2084
00:57:02,801 --> 00:57:05,050
And pocket tourist and
he used to material,

2085
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:08,710
you have to get used to the managing
your obsession with material objects,

2086
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:09,340
you know?

2087
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,270
But it could be managed.

2088
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,650
It's still better to have him.

2089
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:12,431
So way better.

2090
00:57:12,431 --> 00:57:13,180
It happens.

2091
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:16,500
That's what I like about traveling and
not living anywhere is I accumulate a lot

2092
00:57:16,501 --> 00:57:17,130
less shit.

2093
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:17,640
Oh yeah.

2094
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,570
I just don't buy it.

2095
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:18,841
I mean,

2096
00:57:18,841 --> 00:57:19,910
I have my essentials,

2097
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,131
you know,

2098
00:57:20,131 --> 00:57:21,210
and the things I have,

2099
00:57:21,211 --> 00:57:22,080
they're the best,

2100
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,333
you know,

2101
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,760
don't ever ha you don't have a home base.

2102
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:27,480
No.

2103
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,201
So you literally,

2104
00:57:28,201 --> 00:57:30,120
you don't have a place where
you recharge for a week.

2105
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:31,531
No.

2106
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,080
And I,

2107
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,880
I get my mail sent somewhere,

2108
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:35,820
it said,

2109
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:36,810
uh,

2110
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:37,830
yeah.

2111
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:39,720
So you're just hoteling
it everywhere you go.

2112
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:41,131
It depends where I'm at,

2113
00:57:41,131 --> 00:57:41,551
you know?

2114
00:57:41,551 --> 00:57:42,384
Um,

2115
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:42,871
uh,

2116
00:57:42,871 --> 00:57:45,360
well my sister was going
through cancer treatments that,

2117
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:45,660
you know,

2118
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:48,210
brought our family closer together
and went to Florida more often.

2119
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:48,930
Uh,

2120
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:49,560
you know,

2121
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:54,210
last summer I did two months all over
Europe and then I had a week off and

2122
00:57:54,211 --> 00:57:55,680
rented an apartment in Rome.

2123
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:56,280
Oh.

2124
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:56,821
So,

2125
00:57:56,821 --> 00:57:56,981
uh,

2126
00:57:56,981 --> 00:58:01,590
and then last November I finished
a a month in Asia and uh,

2127
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,600
me and my wife went to
Bali for like two weeks.

2128
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:04,650
So it depends on where we're at.

2129
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:05,011
Well,

2130
00:58:05,011 --> 00:58:06,150
like going to New Orleans a lot,

2131
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,590
like when to Austin a lot,

2132
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:08,813
you know,

2133
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,710
just do you book yourself?

2134
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,240
Yeah,

2135
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:11,530
yeah,

2136
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:11,751
yeah,

2137
00:58:11,751 --> 00:58:12,120
yeah,

2138
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:12,410
yeah.

2139
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:13,520
You do everything yourself now.

2140
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:14,210
Everything.

2141
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:14,991
Oh Wow.

2142
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,850
So you don't use an agent or anything?

2143
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:18,280
That's so smart art

2144
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:19,211
at this point.

2145
00:58:19,211 --> 00:58:19,721
Why wasn't,

2146
00:58:19,721 --> 00:58:22,570
they didn't forge relationships
with the international people?

2147
00:58:22,571 --> 00:58:22,781
I mean,

2148
00:58:22,781 --> 00:58:26,710
I went to those places so you know why
he let some guys send an email and get

2149
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:27,460
10%,

2150
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:28,293
you know,

2151
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:31,210
and then I've been doing my own stuff
in the states for like the last five

2152
00:58:31,211 --> 00:58:31,790
years.

2153
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:33,700
And do you try to do
things other than stand up?

2154
00:58:33,701 --> 00:58:35,840
He just kind of tried to
concentrate on just trying to,

2155
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:36,760
you know,

2156
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:36,870
I,

2157
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:37,091
you know,

2158
00:58:37,091 --> 00:58:37,271
I've,

2159
00:58:37,271 --> 00:58:37,501
I've,

2160
00:58:37,501 --> 00:58:38,620
I've got a podcast,

2161
00:58:38,621 --> 00:58:38,890
I've,

2162
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:39,431
uh,

2163
00:58:39,431 --> 00:58:39,941
I'm trying,

2164
00:58:39,941 --> 00:58:41,590
I'm shooting videos all the time.

2165
00:58:41,591 --> 00:58:41,741
I,

2166
00:58:41,741 --> 00:58:42,131
you know,

2167
00:58:42,131 --> 00:58:45,760
I was trying to sell this
comedy travel show idea.

2168
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,313
Now I've heard,

2169
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,010
you know,

2170
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:51,460
some kind of things similar to
that are being made and stuff.

2171
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:51,731
So,

2172
00:58:51,731 --> 00:58:52,510
I don't know,

2173
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:52,931
I just,

2174
00:58:52,931 --> 00:58:53,211
uh,

2175
00:58:53,211 --> 00:58:53,621
I'm just,

2176
00:58:53,621 --> 00:58:58,090
I'm just trying to make as much
art as I can while I'm alive,

2177
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:58,441
you know,

2178
00:58:58,441 --> 00:58:59,800
and just fucking jokes,

2179
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:00,671
videos,

2180
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:01,451
podcasts.

2181
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:02,200
I want to,

2182
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:02,711
uh,

2183
00:59:02,711 --> 00:59:03,040
I've been,

2184
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:03,873
you know,

2185
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,020
writing for the Huffington posts,

2186
00:59:05,021 --> 00:59:05,741
like travel stuff,

2187
00:59:05,741 --> 00:59:06,001
but that,

2188
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,090
I want to get my,

2189
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:08,080
I've got a great stories.

2190
00:59:08,081 --> 00:59:08,291
I mean,

2191
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:08,561
you know,

2192
00:59:08,561 --> 00:59:10,420
the Puerto Rican honeypot,

2193
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:11,381
that's a good story,

2194
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,214
baby.

2195
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,870
So I'm going to get a book together,

2196
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:14,351
you know,

2197
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:14,861
I'm just,

2198
00:59:14,861 --> 00:59:19,300
I'm just a one man comedy art machine
and I'm just trying to fucking,

2199
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:19,780
you know,

2200
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:20,830
are you going to store your book in the,

2201
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,690
but you going to have
it on you at all times.

2202
00:59:23,691 --> 00:59:24,590
You're gonna store it in the cloud.

2203
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,060
What do you mean on your computer?

2204
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,250
You know when you send
things up to the cloud,

2205
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,870
cause I mean that's more appropriate.

2206
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:30,601
Your,

2207
00:59:30,601 --> 00:59:30,881
your,

2208
00:59:30,881 --> 00:59:35,150
your ideas should be out there on a server
somewhere where you're roaming across

2209
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:35,930
where everybody can,

2210
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:36,710
the countryside.

2211
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:36,920
No,

2212
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:37,940
it's not an everybody can,

2213
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:38,930
they're password protected.

2214
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:39,820
Yeah,

2215
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:41,190
we did actually have a hard copy.

2216
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,230
Like some laptops,

2217
00:59:42,231 --> 00:59:43,610
they don't have much storage on them.

2218
00:59:43,611 --> 00:59:46,010
Like a lot of things people are storing.

2219
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:46,510
All right.

2220
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:48,410
They actually pulling
things down from the cloud,

2221
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:51,200
which the problem with that is that you
have to have an internet connection.

2222
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:51,530
No,

2223
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:52,370
and that's the thing I got,

2224
00:59:52,371 --> 00:59:53,190
I got I,

2225
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:53,650
me and my wife,

2226
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:54,680
she's a photographer.

2227
00:59:54,681 --> 00:59:56,390
We both have extra hard drives.

2228
00:59:56,391 --> 00:59:56,810
We've got,

2229
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:57,290
you know,

2230
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:57,830
right.

2231
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:01,010
I got like three hard drives to
travel with and just whip stuff on it.

2232
01:00:01,011 --> 01:00:04,670
And you know that we're filming
and recording and everything.

2233
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:05,440
Before,

2234
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,850
before the big asteroid hit,

2235
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:09,710
everyone probably had their shit on the
cloud and that's why I wouldn't try,

2236
01:00:09,711 --> 01:00:10,760
I wouldn't trust putting something

2237
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,750
that's recipe for disaster.

2238
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,673
Yeah.

2239
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,630
I mean look papers,

2240
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,270
pretty good recipe for disaster to,

2241
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:17,700
yeah.

2242
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:18,700
I mean even the,

2243
01:00:18,701 --> 01:00:20,560
the oldest versions of the Bible,

2244
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:24,460
the Dead Sea Scrolls that were
actually written on animal skins,

2245
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,390
like they,

2246
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:25,841
they,

2247
01:00:25,841 --> 01:00:26,350
uh,

2248
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:27,160
that's like,

2249
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,840
they have like little pieces of shit.

2250
01:00:28,841 --> 01:00:31,330
They try to piece together
because it doesn't last.

2251
01:00:31,331 --> 01:00:32,140
And that's,

2252
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:35,230
that's the only like four or 5,000 years
old or 4,000 something around there.

2253
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:37,300
I think maybe even a little older.

2254
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:38,770
But that mean,

2255
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,850
think about how long,

2256
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,050
how long would a book lasts?

2257
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:43,300
Probably wouldn't even last
as long as a piece of leather,

2258
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:43,990
you know,

2259
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:46,870
a piece of leather that you're writing
on probably last longer than the book

2260
01:00:46,871 --> 01:00:47,230
does.

2261
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:47,561
So like,

2262
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:47,950
I mean,

2263
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:48,783
how many,

2264
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:49,331
you know,

2265
01:00:49,331 --> 01:00:50,640
how many years would a book last?

2266
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:54,070
We got to go back to rock and what the
fuck are you going to do with little

2267
01:00:54,071 --> 01:00:54,611
tiny,

2268
01:00:54,611 --> 01:00:54,971
you know,

2269
01:00:54,971 --> 01:00:55,900
SD cards,

2270
01:00:55,930 --> 01:00:56,111
you know,

2271
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:58,930
you've got an SD card and that's
where you're storing all your shit.

2272
01:00:58,960 --> 01:00:59,201
You know,

2273
01:00:59,201 --> 01:00:59,860
like what does,

2274
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:00,790
who's going in the future?

2275
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:01,441
They're going to find that guy.

2276
01:01:01,441 --> 01:01:02,350
What the fuck is this?

2277
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:02,621
Yeah.

2278
01:01:02,621 --> 01:01:02,711
Well,

2279
01:01:02,711 --> 01:01:04,070
I wonder what that is now for us.

2280
01:01:04,071 --> 01:01:05,830
Like arrowheads were like
what the fuck is that?

2281
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,130
Imagine if it was like some Avatar Shit.

2282
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:11,910
Not only was it an arrowhead,

2283
01:01:11,911 --> 01:01:16,560
it was also like you put it on the right
stone and it would glow and you'd get

2284
01:01:16,561 --> 01:01:17,930
tuned into her mother Gaia

2285
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,660
and most arrowheads just had porn on it.

2286
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,420
Terror attack cause
getting fucked by chicks.

2287
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:26,170
That movie Avatar was so

2288
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:28,860
that movie Avatar was
so fascinating to me.

2289
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:32,550
Not just because I loved the movie but
because of all those people that got

2290
01:01:32,551 --> 01:01:33,690
avatar depression.

2291
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:34,890
Oh yeah.

2292
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:35,790
Live in up in the thing.

2293
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:36,840
No the people,

2294
01:01:36,841 --> 01:01:38,280
the people who watched it,

2295
01:01:38,281 --> 01:01:42,030
they got an Avatar depression cause they
wish their life was as noble and real

2296
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:43,260
as the Navi.

2297
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:44,363
Wow.

2298
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:45,263
Yeah.

2299
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:49,200
It was really fascinating because it was
like a condition that was like getting

2300
01:01:49,201 --> 01:01:50,760
repeatedly diagnosed.

2301
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:53,700
They were calling an avatar
depression half tongue and cheek,

2302
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:54,713
but in half not,

2303
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:58,470
I think that's just a brilliant marketing
move for the Blue Ray release Avatar.

2304
01:01:58,770 --> 01:01:59,581
You might be right.

2305
01:01:59,581 --> 01:01:59,851
Yeah.

2306
01:01:59,851 --> 01:02:01,530
That's probably driving
marketing bullshit.

2307
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:02,710
Oh

2308
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:07,570
well as far as like a overcoming
like obvious fakes on the Internet,

2309
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,270
he's like the master at spotting
bullshit on the Internet.

2310
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:12,460
I'd never met anybody who's got,

2311
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:15,400
I don't think we're ever write any
of its river right all the time.

2312
01:02:15,401 --> 01:02:18,910
But you are like as far as
like videos or pictures,

2313
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:21,430
you're like 99%

2314
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:25,160
well you know what I've been finding out
a lot lately is a new one and I don't

2315
01:02:25,161 --> 01:02:28,010
know if this is mostly probably
just based in Los Angeles,

2316
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:31,520
but there's these guys that go to
parties that act like normal people,

2317
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:33,170
but they have to do something like,

2318
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:33,681
all right.

2319
01:02:33,681 --> 01:02:34,520
I'm like,

2320
01:02:34,521 --> 01:02:36,080
I know somebody that got fired game.

2321
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:36,350
Yeah,

2322
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:37,600
I know some of that got hired to go.

2323
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:37,921
All right,

2324
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:41,210
you're a meth head and you need to go
to the bathroom like every five minutes

2325
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:44,960
and just make it be obvious at the
party and you just kind of be normal.

2326
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:48,590
But just kind of like the big be sweaty
and stuff like they just invite like

2327
01:02:48,591 --> 01:02:50,280
situations to parties like this.

2328
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,120
So it's like a Gig for actors.

2329
01:02:53,121 --> 01:02:54,020
It's good for actors.

2330
01:02:54,021 --> 01:02:54,580
Yeah.

2331
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:55,280
That's good.

2332
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:00,280
Could you imagine you have a party and
some asshole hires a comic or an actor to

2333
01:03:00,531 --> 01:03:04,820
come over and pretend that he's a
method and it keeps like slamming your

2334
01:03:04,821 --> 01:03:08,320
bathroom door and putting on a show and
he's actually getting paid to do that.

2335
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:11,280
But you know the guy and
he's done a really good actor

2336
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:15,230
and halfway through
minutes and you're like,

2337
01:03:15,231 --> 01:03:16,370
what are you doing man?

2338
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:16,821
I take,

2339
01:03:16,821 --> 01:03:18,110
cause you gotta sell the scene.

2340
01:03:18,111 --> 01:03:19,250
You've got to say you to believe it.

2341
01:03:19,251 --> 01:03:19,881
You've got to believe her.

2342
01:03:19,881 --> 01:03:20,450
The message,

2343
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:21,820
you're not doing math right now man.

2344
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:22,663
You're not,

2345
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:24,070
I don't know if I'm crazy.

2346
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:26,953
No,

2347
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:28,213
no you're not.

2348
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:29,850
There was also a,

2349
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:33,980
he a guy that does like overly gay
at party where he's just super,

2350
01:03:33,981 --> 01:03:37,160
super gay and he's a real gay guy but
he does overly gay and they really,

2351
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,273
they rent them out.

2352
01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:42,450
It's just a spice up parties cause you're
not like some parties are just like,

2353
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:46,460
we're all just people who don't have
comedy and I'm to do things like they need

2354
01:03:46,461 --> 01:03:46,671
to,

2355
01:03:46,671 --> 01:03:48,860
they need to hire colorful
characters in real life.

2356
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,880
It's hard to find good
conversation out there in America.

2357
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:52,720
It's hard.

2358
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:52,961
You know,

2359
01:03:52,961 --> 01:03:57,550
you could look upon the wrong fucking
little little corner of the world and be

2360
01:03:57,551 --> 01:03:59,560
stuck on this little circular.

2361
01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:00,820
What are those things called?

2362
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,140
At the end of driveways,

2363
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:04,270
the end of a road called the sac,

2364
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:08,100
you can be caught to call the sack with
two boring motherfuckers and they just,

2365
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:12,010
I was cotton called a sack with two
dummies to dummies in one really nice guy

2366
01:04:12,011 --> 01:04:15,190
who was strange but to
just straight dummies.

2367
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:16,720
I just kind of what a dog.

2368
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:17,101
Okay.

2369
01:04:17,101 --> 01:04:18,430
And his dog was like this creepy dog.

2370
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:19,001
It was always out.

2371
01:04:19,001 --> 01:04:20,140
He didn't really have a fence.

2372
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:21,490
He had a sort of little fence,

2373
01:04:21,491 --> 01:04:24,170
but there was a hill so the dog could go
up the hill and around the fence there

2374
01:04:24,171 --> 01:04:25,300
was no fence was bullshit,

2375
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:26,080
you know?

2376
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,100
And his dog was creepy.

2377
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:28,030
Like you'd go out of the dog,

2378
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:29,080
would growl at you and shit.

2379
01:04:29,081 --> 01:04:31,210
And he bit bit somebody who
was over the guy's house.

2380
01:04:31,211 --> 01:04:32,044
It was painting.

2381
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,940
And so I love dogs.

2382
01:04:33,941 --> 01:04:34,271
I mean,

2383
01:04:34,271 --> 01:04:35,710
I fucking love dogs.

2384
01:04:35,711 --> 01:04:37,060
I've had dogs my whole life.

2385
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:38,710
So when I think a dog,

2386
01:04:38,711 --> 01:04:39,544
it's creepy.

2387
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,350
It's because I know it's erratic.

2388
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:42,160
You know it's not,

2389
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,350
I have a deep love for dogs.

2390
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:44,681
So I,

2391
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:46,270
I went to this dude's house and I'm like,

2392
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:46,991
Hey,

2393
01:04:46,991 --> 01:04:47,380
I'm,

2394
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:48,370
I go the dog.

2395
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:48,641
I go,

2396
01:04:48,641 --> 01:04:48,970
he's,

2397
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:50,020
he's not just getting out,

2398
01:04:50,021 --> 01:04:50,261
man.

2399
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:50,441
I go,

2400
01:04:50,441 --> 01:04:52,930
he's like really being
aggressive and he's ground,

2401
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:55,360
like maybe want like
want to look into this?

2402
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:56,141
And so he goes,

2403
01:04:56,141 --> 01:04:56,231
yeah,

2404
01:04:56,231 --> 01:04:56,431
your,

2405
01:04:56,431 --> 01:04:57,760
your dog got out and attack me.

2406
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:02,320
He just makes up a story about my
dog getting out and attacking him.

2407
01:05:02,321 --> 01:05:02,621
I'm like,

2408
01:05:02,621 --> 01:05:02,980
yeah,

2409
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:03,813
are you okay?

2410
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:04,923
Like what happened?

2411
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:05,990
Many times nine,

2412
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,680
he was 90 pounds a night at 90 pound dog,

2413
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:11,590
the ones to attack it was a pit
bull that wants to attack you.

2414
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:12,730
That's not going to,

2415
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,900
you're not going to survive that.

2416
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:15,190
And if you do survive that,

2417
01:05:15,191 --> 01:05:18,630
you're going to be horribly torn apart
me and might be able to get to a fence

2418
01:05:18,631 --> 01:05:19,250
and shut it.

2419
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:20,083
Well,

2420
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:21,300
I don't think he's going to let go.

2421
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:22,890
I think he's gonna just tear you apart.

2422
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:24,690
I really don't see you survive in that.

2423
01:05:24,810 --> 01:05:25,441
So when you,

2424
01:05:25,441 --> 01:05:29,370
you're a fat guy who smoked cigarettes
and you're telling me my dog attacked you

2425
01:05:29,371 --> 01:05:30,960
and you held him down by his neck.

2426
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:31,950
This guy was telling me,

2427
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,330
I held him down by his Nafta,

2428
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:33,331
Tali,

2429
01:05:33,331 --> 01:05:33,810
calm down.

2430
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:34,021
I go,

2431
01:05:34,021 --> 01:05:34,141
oh,

2432
01:05:34,141 --> 01:05:34,980
he calmed down.

2433
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:37,440
Would that take a year?

2434
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:40,650
You can not hold a pit bull down by the
neck and they're going to calm down.

2435
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:41,910
Do you know anything about dogs?

2436
01:05:41,911 --> 01:05:42,990
You out of your fucking mind?

2437
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,790
Like this is the dumbest story ever.

2438
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:46,680
But I got sad because I was like,

2439
01:05:46,681 --> 01:05:47,790
this guy is,

2440
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:49,590
this is his reality.

2441
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:53,520
His reality is instead of dealing with
these problems and they're like going,

2442
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:53,701
hey,

2443
01:05:53,701 --> 01:05:53,881
you know,

2444
01:05:53,881 --> 01:05:55,210
we've got to put this crazy dog down.

2445
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:55,431
Let's talk.

2446
01:05:55,431 --> 01:05:56,251
It's going to bite somebody.

2447
01:05:56,251 --> 01:05:56,581
It's dogs.

2448
01:05:56,581 --> 01:05:58,110
Creepy sounds wrong with our dog.

2449
01:05:58,740 --> 01:05:59,430
Instead of that,

2450
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:02,370
he's just putting blinders
on and making up stories.

2451
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:03,660
And that's,

2452
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:04,080
you could,

2453
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,100
you could be that guy.

2454
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:07,530
You could be putting blinders
on and making up stories.

2455
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,180
Anybody can be that guy.

2456
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,400
Make up your reality as
it's going little bit.

2457
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:16,270
So that was my fucking neighbor and I'd
see that fucking dummy every day and

2458
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:19,080
you'd ask me stupid
questions about stupid shit.

2459
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:20,910
That's why you never
talked to your neighbors,

2460
01:06:20,911 --> 01:06:21,091
man.

2461
01:06:21,091 --> 01:06:22,770
I do not follow those rules.

2462
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:26,490
I live next to the golf
fencer guys that go to it,

2463
01:06:26,491 --> 01:06:27,850
like renaissance festivals and,

2464
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:28,890
and like,

2465
01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:30,180
they seem like nice people,

2466
01:06:30,181 --> 01:06:31,950
but I don't want to go in that world.

2467
01:06:31,951 --> 01:06:34,590
I don't want them to now like knock
on my door went and just like,

2468
01:06:34,591 --> 01:06:34,741
Hey,

2469
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:35,521
what do you do in Brian?

2470
01:06:35,521 --> 01:06:36,390
I don't want any of that.

2471
01:06:36,391 --> 01:06:38,000
I don't want any
conversations with anybody.

2472
01:06:38,090 --> 01:06:38,530
Yeah.

2473
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:42,590
I moved into my house 10
years ago when my neighbor,

2474
01:06:42,591 --> 01:06:44,630
like the moment I moved in,

2475
01:06:44,631 --> 01:06:48,800
they started sending these notices that
they wanted me to cut my trees down.

2476
01:06:49,490 --> 01:06:52,520
They wanted me to cut my tree so that
they could see like some lights in the

2477
01:06:52,521 --> 01:06:53,354
distance,

2478
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:53,991
you know,

2479
01:06:53,991 --> 01:06:54,771
from behind.

2480
01:06:54,771 --> 01:06:54,991
You know,

2481
01:06:54,991 --> 01:06:55,824
like we're,

2482
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:58,940
I guess if you see through my
trees you could see some lights.

2483
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,710
They wanted me to chop the trees down.

2484
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:01,813
Like,

2485
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,380
like just right when I move in.

2486
01:07:03,381 --> 01:07:03,651
Not,

2487
01:07:03,651 --> 01:07:03,980
not.

2488
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:06,740
Here's a cupcake that my wife baked.

2489
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,150
Welcome to the neighborhood.

2490
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:09,171
You know,

2491
01:07:09,171 --> 01:07:09,531
hey,

2492
01:07:09,531 --> 01:07:12,860
we're going to be sharing space together
on this plan and I'd like to shake your

2493
01:07:12,861 --> 01:07:14,240
hand and say,

2494
01:07:14,241 --> 01:07:14,511
you know,

2495
01:07:14,511 --> 01:07:15,860
and you ever need to
borrow a cup of sugar.

2496
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:17,413
I'm right over here.

2497
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:17,630
Yeah,

2498
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:18,380
that would be nice.

2499
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:20,720
Right now instead of this Dickhead,

2500
01:07:20,721 --> 01:07:24,220
once it bring me in front of some
homeowners association of a reason why,

2501
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:26,600
one of the reasons why I bought
the house is the beautiful trees.

2502
01:07:26,601 --> 01:07:27,434
I love trees.

2503
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:30,980
Chop them down so he could see the lights.

2504
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:31,590
No.

2505
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:34,440
When I do finally find
where I want to live,

2506
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,510
there ain't going to be
no homeowners association.

2507
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:37,570
All everything.

2508
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:40,910
Homeowner's associations
are always assholes.

2509
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:41,250
Yeah.

2510
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:45,180
They tried to tell my friend that he
couldn't put a solar up in his yard and he

2511
01:07:45,181 --> 01:07:45,601
was like,

2512
01:07:45,601 --> 01:07:47,580
why can't I put solar up in my yard?

2513
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:47,911
And they,

2514
01:07:47,911 --> 01:07:48,131
you know,

2515
01:07:48,131 --> 01:07:48,690
they say like,

2516
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:48,901
oh,

2517
01:07:48,901 --> 01:07:50,130
it's on slightly in this thing,

2518
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:51,930
but there's a California state law.

2519
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:55,740
It says that homeowner's associations
can not stop you from putting up solar

2520
01:07:55,741 --> 01:07:56,940
power if you're,

2521
01:07:56,941 --> 01:07:58,220
if you're a smart person,

2522
01:07:58,250 --> 01:07:59,190
you have the shackles,

2523
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:01,620
which I'm not smart
because I haven't done it,

2524
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:02,521
but you're,

2525
01:08:02,521 --> 01:08:06,360
if you're not like having your
house hooked up solar in California,

2526
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,280
this is the greatest resource we have.

2527
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,400
We're so low on resources
here except for sunlight,

2528
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:12,211
sunlight.

2529
01:08:12,211 --> 01:08:16,160
We have a massive abundance of it and
you can power your whole fucking easy

2530
01:08:16,161 --> 01:08:17,570
peasy with,

2531
01:08:17,571 --> 01:08:19,790
with solar in this
country or in this state,

2532
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:20,091
rather.

2533
01:08:20,091 --> 01:08:20,990
It's so easy.

2534
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:21,590
You know,

2535
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:22,490
if you're in Seattle,

2536
01:08:22,491 --> 01:08:23,270
it's going to be a bitch.

2537
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:26,000
But you know what I found
when you're in Seattle,

2538
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:27,740
we were in the fucking woods man,

2539
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:32,770
and this dude had solar panels on the
roof of his car and it's raining and it's

2540
01:08:32,781 --> 01:08:34,400
gloomy and drew this.

2541
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:37,400
This solar panels still pull solar power.

2542
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,960
Even when it's gloomy.

2543
01:08:38,961 --> 01:08:40,220
Even in Seattle,

2544
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:44,120
they're still pulling and charging
is batteries and he was watching TV.

2545
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:46,060
It's fucking crazy awesome at some,

2546
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:47,360
I mean that that's,

2547
01:08:47,361 --> 01:08:49,070
we've been hoodwinked,

2548
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:49,670
you know,

2549
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:52,460
into thinking that that's not
a good way to get your energy.

2550
01:08:52,610 --> 01:08:53,630
Especially around here.

2551
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:55,100
It's the best way to get your energy.

2552
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:01,500
I had a pot growing friends
who used to live in Ukiah.

2553
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:03,901
Ukiah is amazing.

2554
01:09:03,901 --> 01:09:06,180
It's like an hour north of San Francisco.

2555
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:06,780
Woo.

2556
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:09,180
Mendocino county looks
like Switzerland up there.

2557
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,133
Beautiful Hasan.

2558
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,550
And uh,

2559
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,331
this guy loved,

2560
01:09:12,331 --> 01:09:13,081
we'd so much,

2561
01:09:13,081 --> 01:09:14,460
he had his own pot farm,

2562
01:09:14,461 --> 01:09:14,761
but he,

2563
01:09:14,761 --> 01:09:15,001
uh,

2564
01:09:15,001 --> 01:09:15,241
you know,

2565
01:09:15,241 --> 01:09:16,680
the DEA would,

2566
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:17,850
they look for big patches.

2567
01:09:17,851 --> 01:09:18,600
He,

2568
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:23,280
he would plan them in little
bunches along tree lines and he,

2569
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:24,061
he loved,

2570
01:09:24,061 --> 01:09:28,140
we'd so much he got out there with a
shovel and Doug put in a sprinkler system

2571
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,450
or it was timed and you know,

2572
01:09:30,451 --> 01:09:32,130
and he was totally living off the grid.

2573
01:09:32,131 --> 01:09:32,431
He had,

2574
01:09:32,431 --> 01:09:33,180
um,

2575
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:33,451
you know,

2576
01:09:33,451 --> 01:09:35,970
big things that caught rainwater.

2577
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:36,190
He,

2578
01:09:36,190 --> 01:09:36,540
you know,

2579
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:37,373
whatever.

2580
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:39,540
And then he had solar panels on his roof.

2581
01:09:39,570 --> 01:09:41,370
Guy Who completely lived
off the grid and everything.

2582
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:42,060
Wow.

2583
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:42,770
And uh,

2584
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:45,360
he had a heart attack and died
like two years ago out there.

2585
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:46,653
Yeah.

2586
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:47,670
Good.

2587
01:09:47,670 --> 01:09:48,690
That's a good way to go.

2588
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,080
Well,

2589
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:49,261
yeah,

2590
01:09:49,261 --> 01:09:49,531
I mean,

2591
01:09:49,531 --> 01:09:50,040
I miss,

2592
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:50,251
yeah,

2593
01:09:50,251 --> 01:09:50,401
I mean,

2594
01:09:50,401 --> 01:09:51,234
he was

2595
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,400
living off the grid,

2596
01:09:53,401 --> 01:09:56,280
living like a man collecting rain water.

2597
01:09:56,281 --> 01:09:56,941
And you know what I mean?

2598
01:09:56,941 --> 01:09:59,850
If you're going to go out there in the
wilderness where it's beautiful and

2599
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:02,790
you're with nature and you
pass on to the next dimension,

2600
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:03,060
that's,

2601
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:04,110
that's a good way to do it.

2602
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:04,710
Good.

2603
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:04,891
Okay.

2604
01:10:04,891 --> 01:10:07,740
I would selfishly missed my
friend and when I visited him,

2605
01:10:07,741 --> 01:10:12,120
he'd give me like a pound of weed and I
would drive back to Los Angeles with my

2606
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,580
cruise control set on 54

2607
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,850
I'm going 54 right.

2608
01:10:19,851 --> 01:10:21,170
So terrifying.

2609
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:23,030
We've got weed in your car and your dry.

2610
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:23,920
Oh,

2611
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,250
it's a terrifying feeling.

2612
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:26,243
And we're so,

2613
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:27,860
it's so lax here in California.

2614
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:30,470
I have friends that live in California,

2615
01:10:30,471 --> 01:10:34,280
but then they do gigs other places and
they'll forget like if you get busted

2616
01:10:34,281 --> 01:10:35,480
with weed in Texas,

2617
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:35,870
right.

2618
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:37,280
They arrested Willie Nelson.

2619
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:38,121
Right.

2620
01:10:38,121 --> 01:10:39,920
You know Willie fucking nails.

2621
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:41,300
They're state icon.

2622
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:41,891
Yeah.

2623
01:10:41,891 --> 01:10:42,090
Got,

2624
01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:43,220
might as well be your grandfather.

2625
01:10:43,221 --> 01:10:45,350
You're going to rest your grandfather
because he likes to get high.

2626
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:46,993
Wow.

2627
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:49,730
That's the dumbest Shit I've ever heard.

2628
01:10:49,731 --> 01:10:52,310
That's the dumbest use of
serve and protect ever.

2629
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,860
But he's fucking crazy that Willie,

2630
01:10:55,270 --> 01:10:58,840
he's out there smoke who might
write some more great songs,

2631
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:02,120
be out there playing that guitar
and that was fucking hippies.

2632
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:03,021
But Willie's Auntie,

2633
01:11:03,021 --> 01:11:03,920
all other drugs,

2634
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:05,030
the people that work for him,

2635
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,110
uh,

2636
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:08,120
there's the saying among
people that work for willy,

2637
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:08,871
if you're wired,

2638
01:11:08,871 --> 01:11:09,704
you're fired.

2639
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:10,100
Wow,

2640
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:10,520
that's me.

2641
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,290
He doesn't tolerate
any chemicals and shit.

2642
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:13,170
He's,

2643
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:14,220
he's a weed guy.

2644
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:16,860
But those type of like
speed dudes are a nightmare.

2645
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,180
Speed people are a nightmare,

2646
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:18,790
right?

2647
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:20,010
Be especially because their,

2648
01:11:20,011 --> 01:11:22,230
their sense of judgment gets whacked out.

2649
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,940
That's one of the reasons
why they get caught.

2650
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,860
They caught this guy who was a lawyer,

2651
01:11:25,861 --> 01:11:28,050
it was in Esquire or Gq,

2652
01:11:28,051 --> 01:11:30,960
one of those manly men magazines
where it's okay to read it.

2653
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,153
And uh,

2654
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:34,560
this dude was a lawyer and then,

2655
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:35,010
uh,

2656
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:38,150
he did something with meth and uh,

2657
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:40,650
maybe it was like based on a
client that he was working with,

2658
01:11:40,651 --> 01:11:41,490
taught him how to make math.

2659
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:44,640
And then the guy just was making
buckets of it in his basement.

2660
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:45,660
He just seems like it's,

2661
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:46,823
he was nuts.

2662
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:47,431
And you know,

2663
01:11:47,431 --> 01:11:50,130
the cops eventually came over his house
and funnel it was meth and his basement.

2664
01:11:50,131 --> 01:11:50,341
They're like,

2665
01:11:50,341 --> 01:11:50,701
why was he,

2666
01:11:50,701 --> 01:11:51,810
he's acting so crazy.

2667
01:11:51,811 --> 01:11:54,060
Like everybody knew
something had to be going on.

2668
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:55,740
Like the guy had zero,

2669
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:56,491
like his,

2670
01:11:56,491 --> 01:11:58,770
his ability to make
judgment calls was gone.

2671
01:11:59,070 --> 01:11:59,890
So you would never know.

2672
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:01,630
I want to come with her
ass four in the morning.

2673
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:02,660
Things like that.

2674
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,940
If you're an old hippie Willie Nelson,

2675
01:12:04,941 --> 01:12:08,180
whether your gray ponytail and you sitting
out there and trying to write a song

2676
01:12:08,181 --> 01:12:10,760
and you've got this dude working for
you and he's bouncing off the fucking

2677
01:12:10,761 --> 01:12:11,280
walls,

2678
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,590
climbing trees and shit,

2679
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:13,311
you know,

2680
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:13,980
it's a nightmare.

2681
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:14,530
That would be,

2682
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:15,363
yeah,

2683
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,300
that's some Zombie Shit.

2684
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:20,320
Math methods and scary.

2685
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:21,203
Have you ever known anybody,

2686
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:23,413
uh,

2687
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:26,920
older people that had kicked it
and told me that they had done it?

2688
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:27,750
Uh,

2689
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:28,583
no,

2690
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:29,330
no,

2691
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:29,500
it's,

2692
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:29,940
it's,

2693
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:30,310
yeah,

2694
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:31,143
that's,

2695
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,440
I knew a few people really.

2696
01:12:32,710 --> 01:12:33,311
That seems,

2697
01:12:33,311 --> 01:12:34,270
that seems nasty.

2698
01:12:34,271 --> 01:12:34,501
And then,

2699
01:12:34,501 --> 01:12:34,590
yeah,

2700
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:37,270
it's just funny when you travel
around America in the rural areas,

2701
01:12:37,271 --> 01:12:38,950
on the side of barns,

2702
01:12:38,951 --> 01:12:39,650
there's advertised,

2703
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:43,810
you know like meth destroys
families and lives and like,

2704
01:12:43,811 --> 01:12:46,810
and even like above gas pumps,

2705
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,070
like you'd drive to the middle of America.

2706
01:12:48,071 --> 01:12:48,910
There's just these,

2707
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:50,610
so apparently middle American,

2708
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:51,760
it's just meth.

2709
01:12:51,761 --> 01:12:52,594
Crazy.

2710
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:56,560
There's a real problem with rural
areas where there's nothing to do.

2711
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:56,860
Yup.

2712
01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:57,880
Let's stay up all night.

2713
01:12:58,210 --> 01:13:00,250
I think it's one of those
channels learning language,

2714
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:01,240
play chess.

2715
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:02,490
I think it's,

2716
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:04,990
I think it's one of those
trends you can be doing.

2717
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:06,880
It's really hard to let go.

2718
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:08,920
I think once it gets yet it's Gotcha.

2719
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:09,940
Again,

2720
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:13,620
I need some of their like real
physical detoxification and going,

2721
01:13:13,621 --> 01:13:14,600
I need to give you an [inaudible].

2722
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:17,070
Make sure you're not
dehydrated or like he,

2723
01:13:17,170 --> 01:13:17,680
you could,

2724
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,430
you could get,

2725
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:21,310
your body gets wrecked
cause he just red lining

2726
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:23,520
Ge.

2727
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:26,160
So when you finally get off
of your body's just like,

2728
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,650
oh my God,

2729
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:30,840
he just barked it,

2730
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:32,363
cooked it.

2731
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:36,510
You ever met anybody that used to do
like wasn't into math and then started

2732
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,344
doing math?

2733
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:39,600
Uh,

2734
01:13:39,601 --> 01:13:40,434
no.

2735
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:45,090
I've met a couple of evil and they lose
like a good percentage of their ability

2736
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,350
to like be a normal person.

2737
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:49,320
They didn't miss a chunk and they're
always going to be a little wacky,

2738
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:50,940
just a little wacky.

2739
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:53,160
Some dudes get through it fine.

2740
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:57,420
There's a few MMA fighters that had math
problems and then had like real issues

2741
01:13:57,421 --> 01:14:02,421
with it and then like almost died and
then became an incredibly disciplined

2742
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:06,390
because they had like been to the edge
and pulling themselves out of that and

2743
01:14:06,391 --> 01:14:10,720
then recognizing that they have a problem
and they'd be turning their ass around

2744
01:14:10,890 --> 01:14:11,860
beat dragon completely.

2745
01:14:11,861 --> 01:14:15,670
So now they resolved and
like never be defeated again.

2746
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:16,960
It's like some of the
toughest guys in the,

2747
01:14:16,961 --> 01:14:18,400
in a MMA or like that,

2748
01:14:18,401 --> 01:14:21,450
there's a few guys and had
like court McGee who was a,

2749
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,690
who won the ultimate fighter.

2750
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:24,720
He had a like real
substance abuse problem.

2751
01:14:24,721 --> 01:14:25,840
He was actually brought back.

2752
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:26,920
He was resuscitated.

2753
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,090
Wow.

2754
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:28,923
Yeah.

2755
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:31,570
Even when was the last time
you ever heard about that?

2756
01:14:31,571 --> 01:14:33,160
From weed due date of pot,

2757
01:14:33,161 --> 01:14:34,300
Brownie and died,

2758
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:35,320
you know.

2759
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:35,591
No,

2760
01:14:35,591 --> 01:14:40,060
but we it just accept that a certain
amount of penny guy hit a pot brownie and

2761
01:14:40,061 --> 01:14:41,290
really enjoyed Spiderman.

2762
01:14:41,291 --> 01:14:43,690
Three the best sex ever.

2763
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:48,370
If you haven't fucked on pot
cookies or pot Annabelle's,

2764
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:48,641
you're,

2765
01:14:48,641 --> 01:14:50,440
you really don't even
know what sex feels like.

2766
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:51,300
It's,

2767
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:55,750
it's like the same thing between eating
an ice cream Sundae high and eating an

2768
01:14:55,751 --> 01:14:56,890
ice cream sundae sober.

2769
01:14:57,310 --> 01:14:59,350
Such a completely different experience.

2770
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:00,490
Like completely,

2771
01:15:00,491 --> 01:15:01,330
totally different.

2772
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:03,040
But,

2773
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,840
but sex and pot cookies

2774
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:08,800
just cranks the whole thing up.

2775
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:10,060
Walk

2776
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:15,013
every,

2777
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:16,100
every sense.

2778
01:15:16,101 --> 01:15:17,430
Just firing,

2779
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:18,230
crackle,

2780
01:15:18,230 --> 01:15:18,820
Wacko,

2781
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:19,653
cold

2782
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:21,723
and you're freaking out.

2783
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,010
Can you believe you're alive?

2784
01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:25,460
You're weirded out by
sex in the first place.

2785
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:26,880
Then we make an a baby.

2786
01:15:26,881 --> 01:15:27,870
What's going on here?

2787
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:31,113
Wow.

2788
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:32,463
Crackle.

2789
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:34,621
You were a,

2790
01:15:34,621 --> 01:15:35,454
um,

2791
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:40,120
a talk show host in Amsterdam
when everything was illegal here,

2792
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:41,950
but everything was legal there.

2793
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:43,840
What the fuck was that like?

2794
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,000
I cried myself to sleep every night.

2795
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:49,241
It was terrible.

2796
01:15:49,241 --> 01:15:49,810
Jeff,

2797
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:50,410
you know,

2798
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:54,460
Tom and I have been friends for a long
time when we first I knew about you,

2799
01:15:54,461 --> 01:15:56,530
but I didn't meet you
until we did a thing.

2800
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:57,310
Um,

2801
01:15:57,310 --> 01:15:59,920
in New York when we were
both on TV at the same time.

2802
01:15:59,921 --> 01:16:03,340
You had the time roadshow and
I had that news radio thing,

2803
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:06,610
but it was like right away
I can tell you were like,

2804
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:08,470
oh real comic like right.

2805
01:16:08,471 --> 01:16:09,550
We had it like a few,

2806
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:12,130
we had a few words back and
forth and back and forth.

2807
01:16:12,131 --> 01:16:13,270
I'm like this mother,

2808
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:14,290
this is a real comic.

2809
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,210
And then after the show a,

2810
01:16:16,211 --> 01:16:16,451
you know,

2811
01:16:16,451 --> 01:16:17,380
a couple of years later,

2812
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:18,130
hey here,

2813
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:23,130
Tom Rhodes is doing a fucking talk show
over in Holland in Amsterdam and he's

2814
01:16:23,201 --> 01:16:24,940
not even doing it as Tom Rhodes.

2815
01:16:24,941 --> 01:16:27,130
He's like playing a
character and we're like,

2816
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:28,450
that sounds like Tom rose.

2817
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:31,510
That sounds like something Tom Rhodes.

2818
01:16:31,511 --> 01:16:34,120
We do just fucking out there doing it.

2819
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,070
Just out there gangster style.

2820
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:36,671
It was awesome.

2821
01:16:36,671 --> 01:16:38,650
And I was like one of the
best experiences in my life.

2822
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:39,513
What was it called again?

2823
01:16:39,950 --> 01:16:44,450
Well it was the Kevin Masters
show at first and nobody,

2824
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:48,920
they didn't any magazine
newspaper interview I did.

2825
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:49,701
They would say,

2826
01:16:49,701 --> 01:16:51,830
well why is it Kevin
Masters who's Kevin Masters?

2827
01:16:51,831 --> 01:16:52,461
And I would always say,

2828
01:16:52,461 --> 01:16:54,430
I don't know that they,

2829
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:55,550
um,

2830
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:56,780
they came up with the idea,

2831
01:16:56,781 --> 01:16:59,870
we're going to get an American and we're
going to do this like American late

2832
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:02,150
night talk show and we're going
to call him Kevin Masters.

2833
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:02,780
So

2834
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:04,520
did they ask you to stick with that name?

2835
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:04,880
No.

2836
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:05,391
Well no,

2837
01:17:05,391 --> 01:17:06,560
because then I never went along with it.

2838
01:17:06,561 --> 01:17:07,131
I would never,

2839
01:17:07,131 --> 01:17:08,690
whenever anybody would say Kevin,

2840
01:17:08,691 --> 01:17:09,770
I would say name is Tom.

2841
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:10,640
I never,

2842
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:11,000
I,

2843
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:11,630
yeah,

2844
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:13,790
I spent my whole career
trying to establish my name.

2845
01:17:13,791 --> 01:17:14,720
I'm not gonna fucking,

2846
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:15,591
that's like,

2847
01:17:15,591 --> 01:17:16,580
so it was silly.

2848
01:17:16,581 --> 01:17:17,414
So then,

2849
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:17,720
uh,

2850
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,130
seasons two and three,

2851
01:17:19,131 --> 01:17:21,530
it was Kevin Masters starring Tom Rhodes.

2852
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:22,430
Oh,

2853
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:23,121
that's nice.

2854
01:17:23,121 --> 01:17:25,520
So at least they gave
me the star or anything,

2855
01:17:25,521 --> 01:17:26,031
but it was,

2856
01:17:26,031 --> 01:17:26,331
it was,

2857
01:17:26,331 --> 01:17:26,860
you know,

2858
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:28,310
once in a lifetime experience,

2859
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:29,510
um,

2860
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:31,880
there would be like for this girl,

2861
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:32,661
this love story,

2862
01:17:32,661 --> 01:17:34,610
and I was playing in Europe a lot,

2863
01:17:34,611 --> 01:17:35,660
primarily London.

2864
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,150
I was flying back and forth to London,

2865
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:39,050
um,

2866
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:42,290
every other weekend and all
the gigs all over Europe.

2867
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:43,070
And,

2868
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:43,670
uh,

2869
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:45,230
it didn't work out with this girl,

2870
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:50,150
but I had fallen in love with Holland
and Europe and I got this amazing

2871
01:17:50,151 --> 01:17:50,601
television,

2872
01:17:50,601 --> 01:17:50,751
you know,

2873
01:17:50,751 --> 01:17:51,980
do you want to stay and,

2874
01:17:51,981 --> 01:17:54,290
and post your own show.

2875
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:56,900
And I grew up watching Carson
and Letterman and you know,

2876
01:17:56,901 --> 01:18:01,880
to be that guy coming out from behind
the curtain in the $3,000 suit and then

2877
01:18:01,881 --> 01:18:05,330
you stand on the x and you get to do
your little five minute monologue.

2878
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:08,660
And then you walked to the desk and
you banter with your musical hosts,

2879
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:11,480
which I had one little hip hop
guy named [inaudible] life.

2880
01:18:12,350 --> 01:18:12,711
And then,

2881
01:18:12,711 --> 01:18:12,951
you know,

2882
01:18:12,951 --> 01:18:17,450
and then you'd do a skit
and then he could be a,

2883
01:18:17,451 --> 01:18:17,991
you know,

2884
01:18:17,991 --> 01:18:18,621
you do a skit.

2885
01:18:18,621 --> 01:18:19,880
And then first guest.

2886
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:20,150
Uh,

2887
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:21,560
and then my favorite part of the show,

2888
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:26,780
every episode I would get to make a five
minute film where I would experience

2889
01:18:26,781 --> 01:18:28,070
something of Dutch culture.

2890
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:28,941
Uh,

2891
01:18:28,941 --> 01:18:33,410
one day I spent on a Dutch farm with
a farmer and I walked into an electric

2892
01:18:33,411 --> 01:18:33,771
fence.

2893
01:18:33,771 --> 01:18:34,161
He said,

2894
01:18:34,161 --> 01:18:35,780
look out for the electric fence in Dutch,

2895
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:37,160
but I don't speak Dutch.

2896
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,300
So you know,

2897
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,770
seeing like somebody get electrocuted.

2898
01:18:39,771 --> 01:18:40,280
This hilarious.

2899
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:40,540
How,

2900
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:40,990
how does,

2901
01:18:40,990 --> 01:18:41,590
uh,

2902
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:41,910
it,

2903
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:42,300
it's,

2904
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:42,550
it's,

2905
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:43,790
it's not that bad.

2906
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:45,140
Can I cook a Dick off?

2907
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:45,531
No,

2908
01:18:45,531 --> 01:18:47,360
but it makes you jump like a Mofo.

2909
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:48,270
I heard a good luck.

2910
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:49,730
Literally Cook Your Dick off.

2911
01:18:49,731 --> 01:18:50,564
So I'm like,

2912
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:51,140
I got it.

2913
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:52,610
I got a tour of the,

2914
01:18:53,290 --> 01:18:53,660
you know,

2915
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:56,450
the red light district and the uh,

2916
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:00,830
sex laws were explained to me that I
was given a tour of Gay Amsterdam by the

2917
01:19:00,831 --> 01:19:02,360
guy that does the gay parade.

2918
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:03,510
Uh,

2919
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:04,970
I got to cover the,

2920
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:05,420
uh,

2921
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:08,690
the prime minister debates
the lice strikers as bots.

2922
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:12,800
And I was on the floor with a press
badge and a microphone and I'm talking to

2923
01:19:12,801 --> 01:19:13,820
their most powerful,

2924
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,160
there are most important
political leaders where like,

2925
01:19:16,161 --> 01:19:18,170
I couldn't even meet the
governor of my stake.

2926
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,000
And then in the United States.

2927
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:20,380
Yeah.

2928
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:22,360
Unless you were lucky you
were standing next to him.

2929
01:19:22,370 --> 01:19:23,031
Really cool moments.

2930
01:19:23,031 --> 01:19:23,211
You know,

2931
01:19:23,211 --> 01:19:27,360
tenacious d came over and I filmed
a great one of the eye that,

2932
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:29,210
that five minute film,

2933
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:32,060
I gave them a tour of
Amsterdam that's on youtube.

2934
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:33,740
I'll be showing tenacious d around.

2935
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:34,880
You know what else on Youtube?

2936
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:35,630
There's a video.

2937
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:36,650
I think it's on live leak.

2938
01:19:36,651 --> 01:19:37,340
Actually,

2939
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:38,150
Brian,

2940
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:39,020
tell me if this is real.

2941
01:19:39,021 --> 01:19:39,621
These two dudes,

2942
01:19:39,621 --> 01:19:42,710
they piss on an electric fence and we
both get electrocuted at the same time.

2943
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:43,691
Have you seen it?

2944
01:19:43,691 --> 01:19:43,791
Yeah,

2945
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:44,624
that's totally real.

2946
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:47,230
Pulled out of think.

2947
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:50,480
It's funny watching a dude
walk into an electric fence.

2948
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:54,530
Check out what it looks like when two
dudes past tense at the same time.

2949
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:55,431
That's shit hurts.

2950
01:19:55,431 --> 01:19:56,300
So bad touching.

2951
01:19:56,370 --> 01:19:58,400
Oh it is is ridiculous.

2952
01:19:58,490 --> 01:19:59,780
It's hilarious.

2953
01:20:00,110 --> 01:20:00,410
Wow.

2954
01:20:00,410 --> 01:20:01,430
I didn't know what would happen.

2955
01:20:01,431 --> 01:20:02,000
I wonder.

2956
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,200
I wonder if it Dick's are okay.

2957
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:04,123
Probably not right.

2958
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,170
I imagine the amount of force
that goes through your cock.

2959
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:08,030
I wouldn't even chance that one.

2960
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:09,480
If it makes your Dick numb forever.

2961
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,870
You shouldn't do things that like
tamper with the performance of your,

2962
01:20:12,871 --> 01:20:13,290
nope.

2963
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:14,160
That's what I'm talking about.

2964
01:20:14,161 --> 01:20:15,230
Don't let us on an electric fence.

2965
01:20:15,231 --> 01:20:15,841
Tattoos.

2966
01:20:15,841 --> 01:20:16,671
No piercings.

2967
01:20:16,671 --> 01:20:17,820
Snowed Jack pillows.

2968
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:18,691
Yeah.

2969
01:20:18,691 --> 01:20:20,250
Those dudes that split their Dick.

2970
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:21,180
That's Ooh.

2971
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:22,321
Oh my God.

2972
01:20:22,321 --> 01:20:27,321
It looks like one of those hot
dogs he put on a Weber microwave,

2973
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:29,700
microwave the microwave.

2974
01:20:29,701 --> 01:20:30,840
I thought he's just explode.

2975
01:20:30,841 --> 01:20:31,890
It's when you split them,

2976
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:33,930
you know you split people like,

2977
01:20:33,931 --> 01:20:34,621
like hot dogs,

2978
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:35,071
sandwiches.

2979
01:20:35,071 --> 01:20:37,380
Like that was more like of
a back east sort of a thing.

2980
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:38,850
You know you'd get okay,

2981
01:20:38,851 --> 01:20:39,331
here it is.

2982
01:20:39,331 --> 01:20:40,830
Watch this stupid fucks.

2983
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:41,841
They both get out.

2984
01:20:41,841 --> 01:20:42,390
Oh,

2985
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:44,280
I go to Paris on something.

2986
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:46,230
Do you just have to go somewhere in Piss?

2987
01:20:46,231 --> 01:20:49,410
You ever noticed that when
they piss they don't just,

2988
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:52,800
they don't just like pull their
pants down and piss on the ground.

2989
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,370
They have to find something that way.

2990
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:55,171
It's a male thing.

2991
01:20:55,171 --> 01:20:55,531
Totally.

2992
01:20:55,531 --> 01:20:55,651
Yeah.

2993
01:20:55,651 --> 01:20:57,060
This is a military fence too,

2994
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:58,440
so I'm sure pop,

2995
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:00,170
oh,

2996
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:03,540
oh my God.

2997
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:04,800
Oh my God.

2998
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:05,700
That's the only one guy.

2999
01:21:05,701 --> 01:21:09,480
There's another one with
see writes in his stream.

3000
01:21:09,481 --> 01:21:10,740
Hits the electrical.

3001
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:12,503
That's a faint.

3002
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:13,590
He fell like the tree.

3003
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:15,760
Felling a tree.

3004
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:16,201
Hey Man,

3005
01:21:16,201 --> 01:21:17,520
what the fuck makes people faint?

3006
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:19,560
It was having this conversation
the other day with a friend.

3007
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:20,000
What?

3008
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:20,390
What did,

3009
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:21,690
what is it that makes people faint?

3010
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:22,261
Yeah.

3011
01:21:22,261 --> 01:21:22,860
Any idea?

3012
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:23,693
The Beatles.

3013
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:27,840
Elvis is what is the mechanism I use?

3014
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:29,960
It's supposed to protect you
from something like what do you,

3015
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:30,700
why does,

3016
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:31,533
why do people think,

3017
01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:32,010
um,

3018
01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:32,280
well,

3019
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:33,080
goats,

3020
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,320
the fainting goats,

3021
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:38,280
I don't know if you know about those
citizens guts where I think is used as a,

3022
01:21:38,281 --> 01:21:39,114
uh,

3023
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:40,410
as what you just said,

3024
01:21:40,411 --> 01:21:41,250
defense mechanism,

3025
01:21:41,251 --> 01:21:42,300
defense mechanism,

3026
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,300
but kind of defense mechanism.

3027
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:49,070
I think it's something to like
maybe blood running too fast too.

3028
01:21:49,071 --> 01:21:49,501
You know,

3029
01:21:49,501 --> 01:21:50,630
your heart or something like,

3030
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,181
you know what I mean?

3031
01:21:51,181 --> 01:21:53,520
Like it might be something like that.

3032
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,100
It was like if someone was trying to
eat you and you just fall down and play

3033
01:21:56,101 --> 01:21:56,370
dead,

3034
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:57,420
that's a terrible strategy.

3035
01:21:58,150 --> 01:21:59,040
But what the fuck do I know?

3036
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:03,390
You know why he didn't want to made the
platypus nature where I had to get who?

3037
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:05,460
What guy were you talking
to about fainting with?

3038
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:05,971
Oh,

3039
01:22:05,971 --> 01:22:06,804
what was he making you?

3040
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:11,520
A girl that I dated a long time ago
had a real problem with needles,

3041
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:12,330
um,

3042
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:15,560
where she would see her in a
movie and she would just pass out.

3043
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:17,430
And I was like,

3044
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:18,560
I was like trying to figure,

3045
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:20,130
I go to something happened to you.

3046
01:22:20,131 --> 01:22:20,661
Like what?

3047
01:22:20,661 --> 01:22:20,851
You know,

3048
01:22:20,851 --> 01:22:22,160
like what was well,

3049
01:22:22,161 --> 01:22:22,350
no,

3050
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:27,350
she apparently when she was young she
had some sort of a really bad infection

3051
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,450
and they had to give her a bunch of shots,

3052
01:22:30,630 --> 01:22:32,950
like a bunch of shots and apparently it,

3053
01:22:32,951 --> 01:22:35,640
it just hurt like hell and
it just traumatized her.

3054
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:40,940
But then she told me that her dad
was a doctor and her dad would faint.

3055
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:42,373
Oh,

3056
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:43,223
her dad,

3057
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:44,820
he was a dentist actually,

3058
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:46,320
but he would faint.

3059
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,120
Like he would see his son,

3060
01:22:48,121 --> 01:22:50,640
his son had like blisters
on his face because he,

3061
01:22:50,641 --> 01:22:50,910
uh,

3062
01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:52,110
he was out in the sun.

3063
01:22:52,111 --> 01:22:52,880
That sunburn.

3064
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:53,640
He was sunburned,

3065
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,830
so bad that he started getting like
these little blisters on his face.

3066
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,350
The father saw and just
falls down and passes out.

3067
01:22:58,930 --> 01:22:59,220
Like,

3068
01:22:59,220 --> 01:22:59,610
wow,

3069
01:22:59,610 --> 01:22:59,951
what kind of,

3070
01:22:59,951 --> 01:23:02,100
that'd be hard to be a dentist
and not be able to give a shot.

3071
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:03,650
I guess it's,

3072
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:04,920
it has to do with it.

3073
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:06,053
His son

3074
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:08,370
and he couldn't take it
because it was his kid.

3075
01:23:08,371 --> 01:23:08,821
And you know,

3076
01:23:08,821 --> 01:23:13,070
the love that he has for his boy and he
sees him hurt and damaged the freaks out

3077
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:15,960
and just like this is too much
and just completely checks out.

3078
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:16,853
Hmm.

3079
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:17,610
Um,

3080
01:23:17,610 --> 01:23:19,590
I want to give a shout out to my dentist,

3081
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:21,150
Dr Pelerin.

3082
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:22,231
Uh,

3083
01:23:22,231 --> 01:23:23,250
the man just retired.

3084
01:23:23,310 --> 01:23:26,700
He's been our little family dentist
and are in Florida for years.

3085
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:26,851
Oh,

3086
01:23:26,851 --> 01:23:27,420
that's great.

3087
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:29,460
This guy could give a shot.

3088
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:30,190
Oh my God.

3089
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:32,010
Ain't got slay a artist.

3090
01:23:32,310 --> 01:23:33,420
Just an artist.

3091
01:23:33,690 --> 01:23:34,560
The way it didn't hurt.

3092
01:23:34,561 --> 01:23:38,580
And now there's a person who's
replaced him ruthless as good.

3093
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:39,500
Not as good.

3094
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:40,333
It's a Jab,

3095
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:41,420
right?

3096
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:41,830
Yeah.

3097
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:42,581
It's fucking terrible.

3098
01:23:42,581 --> 01:23:42,851
Abby,

3099
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:43,870
with that fucking needle.

3100
01:23:44,850 --> 01:23:45,610
Gee,

3101
01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:47,740
did you see this shit about
these as a storm chasers,

3102
01:23:48,710 --> 01:23:49,300
the cotton,

3103
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:50,920
that hurricane or the tornado rather?

3104
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:54,670
I think I saw something
for flash second there.

3105
01:23:54,671 --> 01:23:55,780
Those dudes that were on that show,

3106
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:56,680
storm chasers.

3107
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,100
Oh,

3108
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,950
they killed when they
got killed by a tornado.

3109
01:24:00,010 --> 01:24:00,843
Wow.

3110
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:01,301
The,

3111
01:24:01,301 --> 01:24:01,540
uh,

3112
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:01,930
let's kind of,

3113
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:02,501
Steve Irwin,

3114
01:24:02,501 --> 01:24:03,100
isn't it?

3115
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:03,791
A little bit,

3116
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:04,271
but no,

3117
01:24:04,271 --> 01:24:06,760
because what these guys were
doing was measuring the,

3118
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:10,210
the velocity of the wind and how
far it tastes like they were,

3119
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:12,490
they were recording data
that how she to do this.

3120
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:14,410
Yes and no.

3121
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,340
I mean I think you have to,

3122
01:24:15,341 --> 01:24:20,140
you got to be right up on it now with
his litmus to register like the speed of

3123
01:24:20,141 --> 01:24:21,370
the wind and shit like that.

3124
01:24:21,371 --> 01:24:22,090
I think like,

3125
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:23,380
it varies in,

3126
01:24:23,381 --> 01:24:23,651
you know,

3127
01:24:23,651 --> 01:24:26,200
like where are wherever
you are from close to far.

3128
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:29,810
And I think they make those calculations
based on a lot of data that they take

3129
01:24:29,811 --> 01:24:30,644
in the field.

3130
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:32,170
As far as I know,

3131
01:24:32,171 --> 01:24:34,630
there's a great benefit
to doing it like that.

3132
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:35,480
Wow.

3133
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:36,520
That Oklahoma City,

3134
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:37,410
that was amazing.

3135
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:39,690
I was in New Zealand where
that happened and it just like,

3136
01:24:39,870 --> 01:24:40,320
you know,

3137
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:40,800
Eh,

3138
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:41,460
uh,

3139
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:42,930
as the story was unfolding,

3140
01:24:44,210 --> 01:24:44,791
it's amazing how,

3141
01:24:44,791 --> 01:24:45,031
you know,

3142
01:24:45,031 --> 01:24:46,350
news goes around the world instantly,

3143
01:24:46,351 --> 01:24:46,741
but you know,

3144
01:24:46,741 --> 01:24:50,070
you'd like a mile wide path
ripping through the city.

3145
01:24:50,071 --> 01:24:51,210
Just the devastation.

3146
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:51,850
It's any time.

3147
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:52,591
Do you remember Joplin,

3148
01:24:52,591 --> 01:24:53,340
Missouri?

3149
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:53,880
Oh yeah.

3150
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:54,121
God,

3151
01:24:54,121 --> 01:24:55,110
that one we got wiped out.

3152
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:56,850
It's like literally didn't exist anymore.

3153
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:57,340
Right.

3154
01:24:57,340 --> 01:24:57,550
It's,

3155
01:24:57,550 --> 01:24:57,960
it's,

3156
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:58,641
and if you look at it,

3157
01:24:58,641 --> 01:24:59,950
it was an older town too.

3158
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:00,803
I had passed through.

3159
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:01,290
I used to,

3160
01:25:01,290 --> 01:25:02,190
when I did the road,

3161
01:25:02,191 --> 01:25:03,750
I drove through Joplin a few times,

3162
01:25:04,130 --> 01:25:04,280
like a

3163
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:04,910
brush,

3164
01:25:04,910 --> 01:25:06,410
like a mile wide brush,

3165
01:25:06,411 --> 01:25:08,590
just just like a big horse hair brush.

3166
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:12,830
Just scrubbed it right
off the face of the world.

3167
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:14,133
It's just,

3168
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:18,200
it's an incredible thing that the wind
in under certain conditions can reach

3169
01:25:18,201 --> 01:25:19,190
that kind of a frenzy.

3170
01:25:19,191 --> 01:25:19,401
You know?

3171
01:25:19,401 --> 01:25:19,990
It's really,

3172
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:20,270
it's,

3173
01:25:20,270 --> 01:25:21,070
it's,

3174
01:25:21,070 --> 01:25:21,470
it's,

3175
01:25:21,470 --> 01:25:22,550
it's so shocking.

3176
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:23,371
Like our,

3177
01:25:23,371 --> 01:25:27,140
our calm world that we live
in for the most part is,

3178
01:25:27,141 --> 01:25:27,940
uh,

3179
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:28,430
it's,

3180
01:25:28,430 --> 01:25:31,640
it's so different than what happens
with the fucking door dado comes,

3181
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:34,730
it's just so hard for us to
wrap our heads around it.

3182
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:36,381
Fuck.

3183
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:37,470
Tornadoes do,

3184
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:38,313
did you ever see,

3185
01:25:38,630 --> 01:25:42,770
do you ever see the one from Dallas
or it's throwing semis in the air?

3186
01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:46,610
Semis are spinning around
in a circle like leaves.

3187
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:47,330
Wow.

3188
01:25:47,330 --> 01:25:48,260
It's insane.

3189
01:25:48,650 --> 01:25:53,650
They're just flying through the air 18
wheelers just flying through the air.

3190
01:25:54,230 --> 01:25:56,570
It's throwing around trucks.

3191
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:58,400
It doesn't even drop him.

3192
01:25:58,401 --> 01:25:59,600
It's just spinning them around.

3193
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:01,730
It's like a goddamn movie like that,

3194
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:02,750
that twist her movie.

3195
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:04,220
Twister,

3196
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:04,581
twister.

3197
01:26:04,581 --> 01:26:05,130
What's her name?

3198
01:26:05,130 --> 01:26:05,710
Uh,

3199
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:07,490
at a wet t shirt on the scene.

3200
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:08,420
Helen Hunt.

3201
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:09,253
That was,

3202
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:10,213
that was it.

3203
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:12,080
That's the thing about New
Zealand that I really enjoyed.

3204
01:26:12,081 --> 01:26:13,160
They go really,

3205
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:13,520
uh,

3206
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,680
there's a nice filter of,

3207
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:16,553
of,

3208
01:26:16,650 --> 01:26:18,110
of negative,

3209
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:19,880
of negative news.

3210
01:26:19,881 --> 01:26:20,330
They don't,

3211
01:26:20,330 --> 01:26:21,950
they don't get in New Zealand.

3212
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:23,000
Um,

3213
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,570
they don't like the Middle East
doesn't even exist in their news.

3214
01:26:26,571 --> 01:26:26,871
You don't,

3215
01:26:26,871 --> 01:26:28,640
you don't hear any stories about Syria,

3216
01:26:28,670 --> 01:26:29,503
Israel,

3217
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:30,373
um,

3218
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:30,861
you know,

3219
01:26:30,861 --> 01:26:35,861
in the United States it's always shootings
and bombings and disasters in New

3220
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:36,981
Zealand.

3221
01:26:36,981 --> 01:26:39,320
The newspaper is like a
sheep gotten the road.

3222
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:40,191
Will you interview,

3223
01:26:40,191 --> 01:26:40,430
you know,

3224
01:26:40,430 --> 01:26:41,211
very calm.

3225
01:26:41,211 --> 01:26:42,044
We do there.

3226
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:43,730
We interviewed them in person.

3227
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,390
Yes.

3228
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:45,350
I want to meet that guy.

3229
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:46,541
He's a fascinating guy.

3230
01:26:46,541 --> 01:26:48,410
He would love the guy and a,

3231
01:26:48,411 --> 01:26:49,160
you should hear it.

3232
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:51,160
You should listen to the
conversation I did with him.

3233
01:26:51,190 --> 01:26:52,820
He's really articulate.

3234
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:53,660
Oh,

3235
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:53,991
brilliant.

3236
01:26:53,991 --> 01:26:55,040
And the guy's really funny too.

3237
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:55,281
He's,

3238
01:26:55,281 --> 01:26:56,061
he's uh,

3239
01:26:56,061 --> 01:26:57,410
he's got a great sense of humor.

3240
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:58,633
Um,

3241
01:26:58,760 --> 01:26:59,541
it was remarkable.

3242
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:01,400
I did the,

3243
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:01,940
uh,

3244
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:03,590
NPR of New Zealand,

3245
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:05,240
Radio New Zealand.

3246
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:06,800
And the woman asked me,

3247
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:07,510
you know,

3248
01:27:07,510 --> 01:27:09,230
what would you like to do
while you're in New Zealand?

3249
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:09,801
And I said,

3250
01:27:09,801 --> 01:27:14,780
I'd like to meet kim.com and a few hours
later he followed me back on Twitter

3251
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:16,790
and I looked at his Twitter thing and,

3252
01:27:16,791 --> 01:27:17,110
uh,

3253
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:20,530
he had an email and I sent
him a nice email and said,

3254
01:27:20,540 --> 01:27:21,231
I'd like to do chat,

3255
01:27:21,231 --> 01:27:22,940
which I think is really fascinating guy.

3256
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:26,630
And he's really portrayed in the
American media is a site kind of,

3257
01:27:26,631 --> 01:27:27,350
you know,

3258
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:27,951
bond,

3259
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:28,491
villain,

3260
01:27:28,491 --> 01:27:29,180
you know,

3261
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:30,013
uh,

3262
01:27:30,390 --> 01:27:31,100
you know,

3263
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:31,940
bad person.

3264
01:27:31,941 --> 01:27:36,941
But I think the guy manipulated the
strengths of the tools he was working with

3265
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:38,900
when the Internet came on.

3266
01:27:38,901 --> 01:27:42,230
And he's the reason a lot of
rules were put into place.

3267
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:43,011
He,

3268
01:27:43,011 --> 01:27:43,431
you know what,

3269
01:27:43,431 --> 01:27:47,750
he totally straightened me out because
I had the misconception that I thought

3270
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:50,060
the website mega upload did,

3271
01:27:50,061 --> 01:27:50,930
he made all the money from,

3272
01:27:50,931 --> 01:27:51,764
I thought,

3273
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:52,160
oh,

3274
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:54,320
that's like the Napster
of movies or something.

3275
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:55,041
You know,

3276
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:55,671
I'd never used it.

3277
01:27:55,671 --> 01:27:56,540
I didn't know what it was.

3278
01:27:56,930 --> 01:27:57,560
Um,

3279
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:57,851
and he,

3280
01:27:57,851 --> 01:27:58,551
he corrected me.

3281
01:27:58,551 --> 01:27:58,731
He said,

3282
01:27:58,731 --> 01:27:59,030
no,

3283
01:27:59,030 --> 01:28:02,090
they never had a search engine thing.

3284
01:28:02,091 --> 01:28:04,460
You couldn't type in
Avatar and find Avatar,

3285
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:05,411
whereas the,

3286
01:28:05,411 --> 01:28:06,201
the Napster,

3287
01:28:06,201 --> 01:28:10,190
you could stretch search in Metallica
Zeplin and I'd get all this stuff.

3288
01:28:10,670 --> 01:28:12,260
So they never had that.

3289
01:28:12,261 --> 01:28:13,670
It was people sharing files,

3290
01:28:13,671 --> 01:28:15,500
like kind of Dropbox or something,

3291
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:16,371
you know,

3292
01:28:16,371 --> 01:28:17,204
and he didn't,

3293
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,113
you know,

3294
01:28:18,230 --> 01:28:19,063
know what was,

3295
01:28:20,050 --> 01:28:20,450
uh,

3296
01:28:20,450 --> 01:28:20,941
people were,

3297
01:28:20,941 --> 01:28:21,081
were,

3298
01:28:21,081 --> 01:28:21,351
were,

3299
01:28:21,351 --> 01:28:23,210
were trading or sharing it and a,

3300
01:28:23,211 --> 01:28:23,550
it,

3301
01:28:23,550 --> 01:28:24,650
he's a fascinating guy,

3302
01:28:24,651 --> 01:28:24,891
man.

3303
01:28:24,891 --> 01:28:25,820
I sent him an email,

3304
01:28:25,821 --> 01:28:29,000
he invites me to his mansion and,

3305
01:28:29,140 --> 01:28:29,360
uh,

3306
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:30,800
it was on the last day I was there.

3307
01:28:30,801 --> 01:28:31,340
So,

3308
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:31,470
uh,

3309
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:31,971
you know,

3310
01:28:31,971 --> 01:28:32,900
I was from,

3311
01:28:32,930 --> 01:28:34,190
from his house to the airport.

3312
01:28:34,191 --> 01:28:36,260
I only got to talk to him for an hour,

3313
01:28:36,261 --> 01:28:40,640
but just wonderful man invites
me into his home and just,

3314
01:28:40,641 --> 01:28:41,210
you know,

3315
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:41,910
uh,

3316
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:44,270
[inaudible] the guy is,

3317
01:28:44,330 --> 01:28:44,840
he's,

3318
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:47,210
I think he's kind of like
an Internet visionary.

3319
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:48,860
He's got a lot of great thoughts about,

3320
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:49,520
um,

3321
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:51,070
where the Internet is going and,

3322
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:51,720
and,

3323
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:52,011
and then,

3324
01:28:52,011 --> 01:28:52,221
you know,

3325
01:28:52,221 --> 01:28:54,860
in the United States is trying to
extradite him other than really,

3326
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,550
yeah.

3327
01:28:55,550 --> 01:28:58,220
And it's a charge piracy,

3328
01:28:58,221 --> 01:28:59,680
I guess if it's,

3329
01:28:59,681 --> 01:29:01,200
he had like the best DVR ever.

3330
01:29:01,201 --> 01:29:01,411
Like,

3331
01:29:01,411 --> 01:29:01,561
Hey,

3332
01:29:01,561 --> 01:29:04,620
do you want to watch like all these
homemade porns from every single person

3333
01:29:04,621 --> 01:29:07,080
that's ever uploaded this mega upload,

3334
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:08,850
which is what I was only there an hour.

3335
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:09,540
I didn't,

3336
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:10,770
I didn't get to see the upstairs.

3337
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:11,870
Those aren't going to be good.

3338
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:15,750
They're going to be fat dudes with their
tongue out of their car right in front

3339
01:29:15,751 --> 01:29:16,620
of the Lens.

3340
01:29:17,010 --> 01:29:18,530
That's what we're going to see
if you tuned into people's,

3341
01:29:18,730 --> 01:29:19,000
no,

3342
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:19,171
no,

3343
01:29:19,171 --> 01:29:19,321
no,

3344
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:19,591
no.

3345
01:29:19,591 --> 01:29:19,940
He's sick.

3346
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:21,510
He's got you guys got a beautiful wife.

3347
01:29:21,511 --> 01:29:22,890
He's got like five kids.

3348
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:24,090
He's a Gamer man.

3349
01:29:24,091 --> 01:29:26,920
The Guy Loves Games and I
bet you guys great movies,

3350
01:29:26,921 --> 01:29:27,260
Huh?

3351
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:27,600
Uh,

3352
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:28,440
I was a fan of his

3353
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:29,770
way back in the day.

3354
01:29:29,771 --> 01:29:31,660
He had a really cool website.

3355
01:29:31,661 --> 01:29:36,310
He was like one of the first guys that
had like this really like high level

3356
01:29:36,311 --> 01:29:38,920
personal website and it was all like,

3357
01:29:38,921 --> 01:29:42,100
he had an animated feature
where I think it was Milosevic.

3358
01:29:42,230 --> 01:29:42,490
Is it?

3359
01:29:42,490 --> 01:29:43,011
Who's the,

3360
01:29:43,011 --> 01:29:43,820
the evil guy?

3361
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:44,441
Most of it.

3362
01:29:44,441 --> 01:29:44,831
Yeah.

3363
01:29:44,831 --> 01:29:46,120
I think it was him that he was,

3364
01:29:46,121 --> 01:29:47,530
he was killing in his,

3365
01:29:47,531 --> 01:29:47,860
uh,

3366
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:48,281
in his,

3367
01:29:48,281 --> 01:29:50,830
our cartoon that he had on his website.

3368
01:29:50,831 --> 01:29:53,080
Like if it was like all flash animated,

3369
01:29:53,081 --> 01:29:54,790
like really bad ass it called,

3370
01:29:55,150 --> 01:29:56,620
I forget strong battery.

3371
01:29:56,930 --> 01:29:59,110
It was kim.com even find it.

3372
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:02,020
I don't even know if he was calling
himself Kim Dotcom back then.

3373
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:04,500
I think it was,

3374
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:05,940
he was just calling himself Kim.

3375
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:07,360
Yeah.

3376
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,170
But uh,

3377
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:08,470
he,

3378
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:10,180
his website was like genius.

3379
01:30:10,181 --> 01:30:11,680
It was like really high level shit.

3380
01:30:11,710 --> 01:30:14,110
My friend Andrew turned me
onto it and he was like,

3381
01:30:14,111 --> 01:30:15,340
you gotta look at this guy's website.

3382
01:30:15,341 --> 01:30:17,020
Like this guy's website
is on another level.

3383
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:17,771
And I went to,

3384
01:30:17,771 --> 01:30:18,101
and I was like,

3385
01:30:18,101 --> 01:30:18,590
whoa.

3386
01:30:18,590 --> 01:30:18,840
Right.

3387
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:20,900
He was on top of the Internet
game from the beginning.

3388
01:30:20,970 --> 01:30:22,260
This is like late nineties,

3389
01:30:22,261 --> 01:30:22,591
I think.

3390
01:30:22,591 --> 01:30:23,221
Maybe.

3391
01:30:23,221 --> 01:30:23,551
Yeah,

3392
01:30:23,551 --> 01:30:25,230
maybe 2000 at the most.

3393
01:30:25,231 --> 01:30:28,530
So it was a fascinating
fucking website back then.

3394
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:33,060
So this guy is like being at the front
line or the Internet for a long ass time.

3395
01:30:33,061 --> 01:30:35,100
That was when he was doing like hacker.

3396
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:39,540
He was a hacker and then he went into
security and he was doing like security

3397
01:30:39,541 --> 01:30:41,220
for big companies.

3398
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:42,331
That's what he said.

3399
01:30:42,331 --> 01:30:44,460
He got busted and then
he got hired by like 18.

3400
01:30:44,461 --> 01:30:45,850
His fist story's fascinating.

3401
01:30:45,910 --> 01:30:46,060
Right.

3402
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:46,580
You know,

3403
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:47,210
uh,

3404
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:48,480
the only thing I didn't
get to ask him was,

3405
01:30:48,481 --> 01:30:49,860
who do you want to play you in the movie?

3406
01:30:51,330 --> 01:30:52,150
Um,

3407
01:30:52,150 --> 01:30:52,500
they,

3408
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:56,370
he was a hacker from first
and then he got a good call.

3409
01:30:56,730 --> 01:30:57,241
Uh,

3410
01:30:57,241 --> 01:30:59,880
and then he got hired by at and
t and all these companies to,

3411
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:01,500
for him to explain,

3412
01:31:01,501 --> 01:31:01,950
you know,

3413
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:04,440
the workings of their system
and how someone could get in.

3414
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:04,890
I mean,

3415
01:31:04,890 --> 01:31:05,311
yeah,

3416
01:31:05,311 --> 01:31:07,500
I would imagine you need that
if you're a fucking bank,

3417
01:31:07,501 --> 01:31:07,950
right?

3418
01:31:07,950 --> 01:31:08,330
Yeah.

3419
01:31:08,330 --> 01:31:09,163
A little.

3420
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:10,051
That's what's amazing.

3421
01:31:10,051 --> 01:31:10,621
That they allow you to,

3422
01:31:10,621 --> 01:31:10,710
yeah.

3423
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:11,370
Bank online,

3424
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:12,570
but you can vote online.

3425
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:13,290
That's,

3426
01:31:13,290 --> 01:31:14,490
that's hilarious.

3427
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:15,491
It's a,

3428
01:31:15,491 --> 01:31:20,491
it's too dangerous and ensure the
veracity of this transmission to dangerous

3429
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:23,760
voting online folding is too important,

3430
01:31:23,761 --> 01:31:24,594
but your money,

3431
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:25,920
this is more convenient.

3432
01:31:26,630 --> 01:31:27,400
Hmm.

3433
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,710
I can't find anything about
it as early cartoons stuff.

3434
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:30,821
Anyway,

3435
01:31:30,821 --> 01:31:31,161
I had a,

3436
01:31:31,161 --> 01:31:34,510
I had a great conversation with him for
an hour and he's very generous for him

3437
01:31:34,511 --> 01:31:34,841
to do that.

3438
01:31:34,841 --> 01:31:38,540
And the guy loves comedy pull
up versus Malosha Vich uh,

3439
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:39,790
I don't even know how to spell that.

3440
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:41,380
And uh,

3441
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:41,820
you know,

3442
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:42,090
I,

3443
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:45,670
I found him very humorous
and a a good dude.

3444
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:47,460
I enjoy looking at him in his eyes and,

3445
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:48,190
and uh,

3446
01:31:48,190 --> 01:31:49,420
asking him whatever I felt like.

3447
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:50,020
What do think

3448
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:50,980
the argument is?

3449
01:31:51,010 --> 01:31:54,250
Do you think the argument is that people
should be able to share files and then

3450
01:31:54,251 --> 01:31:55,150
if you buy something,

3451
01:31:55,151 --> 01:31:58,090
you should be able to put online and
other people she will to pull it down if

3452
01:31:58,091 --> 01:32:00,120
they want it and upload something that

3453
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:00,810
they bought.

3454
01:32:00,810 --> 01:32:03,300
But as long as someone's buying the
original thing and uploading it,

3455
01:32:03,301 --> 01:32:04,440
then it's not theft.

3456
01:32:04,470 --> 01:32:08,100
That's what a lot of people feel and a
lot of people feel like as long as I'm

3457
01:32:08,101 --> 01:32:09,200
not actually taking,

3458
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:10,550
if it was paid for once,

3459
01:32:10,830 --> 01:32:11,360
Sherry,

3460
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:11,530
well,

3461
01:32:11,530 --> 01:32:11,901
yeah,

3462
01:32:11,901 --> 01:32:12,560
I don't know.

3463
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,110
I think they,

3464
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:13,371
you know,

3465
01:32:13,371 --> 01:32:15,920
they're going to limit it as
much as they possibly can,

3466
01:32:15,950 --> 01:32:17,240
but I don't think they'll ever to,

3467
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:17,970
you know,

3468
01:32:17,970 --> 01:32:20,330
with Dropbox and all these
different technologies,

3469
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:21,820
it'd be impossible to,

3470
01:32:22,170 --> 01:32:23,210
to totally stop it.

3471
01:32:23,211 --> 01:32:23,391
Yeah.

3472
01:32:23,391 --> 01:32:24,380
But what I'm asking is like,

3473
01:32:24,381 --> 01:32:25,370
what is his argument?

3474
01:32:25,371 --> 01:32:25,581
Like,

3475
01:32:25,581 --> 01:32:25,940
what is it,

3476
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:26,390
you know,

3477
01:32:26,390 --> 01:32:27,460
guys and get I give you,

3478
01:32:27,470 --> 01:32:27,581
you,

3479
01:32:27,581 --> 01:32:27,951
you're my,

3480
01:32:27,951 --> 01:32:30,980
I leave you my iPod with my
fucking massive music collection.

3481
01:32:31,010 --> 01:32:31,510
You know,

3482
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:32,300
it's supposed to take,

3483
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:33,410
I'm supposed to like say no,

3484
01:32:33,411 --> 01:32:35,370
I'm gonna give this back to the RCA.

3485
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:36,980
God roads paid for all these songs.

3486
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:37,450
Well,

3487
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:38,300
I didn't know he liked,

3488
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:39,513
yeah.

3489
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:40,790
Fancy client or whatever.

3490
01:32:41,430 --> 01:32:41,631
Man,

3491
01:32:41,631 --> 01:32:43,070
I'm fucking rock that Patsy Cline.

3492
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:43,821
But yeah,

3493
01:32:43,821 --> 01:32:44,770
like who's the center?

3494
01:32:44,771 --> 01:32:45,350
Right.

3495
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:46,750
Which is to say what
happens to it after you,

3496
01:32:46,751 --> 01:32:47,061
but I don't,

3497
01:32:47,061 --> 01:32:52,061
they'll never be able to control
that for everything being paid for.

3498
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:53,500
What does kim.com,

3499
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:53,990
uh,

3500
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:54,530
argument,

3501
01:32:54,530 --> 01:32:56,690
like does he think that
things should be that way?

3502
01:32:56,691 --> 01:32:58,490
That you should be able
to [inaudible] you know,

3503
01:32:58,491 --> 01:32:59,324
and uh,

3504
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:01,010
this is me speaking,

3505
01:33:01,011 --> 01:33:01,521
I think,

3506
01:33:01,521 --> 01:33:02,160
you know,

3507
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:02,930
he did.

3508
01:33:02,930 --> 01:33:05,240
He's the reason a lot of
rules were put into place.

3509
01:33:05,570 --> 01:33:06,260
So,

3510
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:06,621
you know,

3511
01:33:06,621 --> 01:33:06,791
and,

3512
01:33:06,791 --> 01:33:08,420
and now he's his,

3513
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:08,870
his,

3514
01:33:08,870 --> 01:33:09,441
his website.

3515
01:33:09,441 --> 01:33:09,780
And when it,

3516
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:10,100
you know,

3517
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:12,860
he's complying with a business.

3518
01:33:12,861 --> 01:33:14,060
It's kind of like in New Zealand,

3519
01:33:14,061 --> 01:33:15,950
they feel like the guys kind of,

3520
01:33:16,070 --> 01:33:16,760
uh,

3521
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:19,490
being persecuted by the
American government.

3522
01:33:19,491 --> 01:33:24,491
He thinks like the Hollywood studios
that backed Obama's campaign,

3523
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:26,241
uh,

3524
01:33:26,241 --> 01:33:28,270
they're the ones that wanted,

3525
01:33:28,740 --> 01:33:29,150
you know,

3526
01:33:29,150 --> 01:33:32,450
perpetuate this and have him
extradited and face charges.

3527
01:33:32,451 --> 01:33:32,721
And he's,

3528
01:33:32,721 --> 01:33:33,470
you know,

3529
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:36,500
and if he is made an
example of then other,

3530
01:33:36,530 --> 01:33:37,280
you know,

3531
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:37,960
Internet,

3532
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:38,241
you know,

3533
01:33:38,241 --> 01:33:39,380
hacker or whatever,

3534
01:33:39,381 --> 01:33:40,214
people,

3535
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:42,200
it sends a message to those people,

3536
01:33:42,230 --> 01:33:43,063
you know,

3537
01:33:43,190 --> 01:33:44,060
that makes sense.

3538
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:44,870
I mean,

3539
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:47,270
they definitely do that with
entertainers that get caught.

3540
01:33:47,271 --> 01:33:48,650
We're not paying their taxes.

3541
01:33:48,970 --> 01:33:49,390
Like,

3542
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:50,510
like blade,

3543
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:51,651
they put him in jail.

3544
01:33:51,651 --> 01:33:54,350
They put Wesley Snipes and
Jeff for three fucking years.

3545
01:33:54,610 --> 01:33:54,830
You know,

3546
01:33:54,830 --> 01:33:55,970
he was trying to pay it back.

3547
01:33:55,971 --> 01:33:56,241
They're like,

3548
01:33:56,241 --> 01:33:56,750
yeah,

3549
01:33:56,750 --> 01:33:57,583
no,

3550
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:57,771
I mean,

3551
01:33:57,771 --> 01:33:58,370
he couldn't even,

3552
01:33:58,370 --> 01:33:59,450
they didn't even say,

3553
01:33:59,451 --> 01:33:59,841
hey,

3554
01:33:59,841 --> 01:34:02,180
you owe us money and
since you lost in court,

3555
01:34:02,390 --> 01:34:04,280
now you have to pay it plus a fine.

3556
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:05,031
They're like,

3557
01:34:05,031 --> 01:34:05,540
no,

3558
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:10,540
we're going to take your freedom publicly
for three years and lock you in a cage

3559
01:34:10,881 --> 01:34:11,610
as you're,

3560
01:34:11,610 --> 01:34:12,091
you know,

3561
01:34:12,091 --> 01:34:13,760
nearing your early fifties.

3562
01:34:13,850 --> 01:34:15,050
It's not going to be so fun.

3563
01:34:15,830 --> 01:34:16,850
And then when you get out,

3564
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,620
we'd like all that money back please.

3565
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:19,720
Then when you get out,

3566
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,140
you've got to claw your way back.

3567
01:34:21,141 --> 01:34:21,974
Okay.

3568
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:24,830
And then he's a little aged as an actor.

3569
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:27,890
You know what they would he do that so
long that he's putting on plays in the

3570
01:34:27,891 --> 01:34:28,221
jail.

3571
01:34:28,221 --> 01:34:30,350
He might lose his chops a little bit.

3572
01:34:30,351 --> 01:34:31,430
Staying Sharp,

3573
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:33,430
but you should listen to my,

3574
01:34:33,431 --> 01:34:33,750
uh,

3575
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:35,150
my podcast with him.com.

3576
01:34:35,151 --> 01:34:35,810
How do I get it?

3577
01:34:35,810 --> 01:34:37,010
Is it iTunes?

3578
01:34:37,011 --> 01:34:37,844
Tom Rhodes radio,

3579
01:34:37,850 --> 01:34:38,840
Tom Rhodes radio.

3580
01:34:39,230 --> 01:34:40,310
Why'd you choose that name?

3581
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:45,380
Because I thought I could play whatever
I wanted and I'd take like sound clips

3582
01:34:45,381 --> 01:34:46,390
from movies and like,

3583
01:34:46,391 --> 01:34:48,300
and when I talked with Comedians,

3584
01:34:48,710 --> 01:34:49,340
um,

3585
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:49,660
I'll,

3586
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:52,310
I'll put little snippets of
their standup in there and stuff.

3587
01:34:52,610 --> 01:34:54,120
Do you going to run into
problems doing that?

3588
01:34:54,170 --> 01:34:55,230
I know and I've tried it.

3589
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:56,750
I don't have any commercials.

3590
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:57,680
It's free.

3591
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:58,130
Hmm.

3592
01:34:58,130 --> 01:34:58,521
Okay.

3593
01:34:58,521 --> 01:34:59,260
So,

3594
01:34:59,260 --> 01:34:59,870
uh,

3595
01:34:59,870 --> 01:35:00,703
free.

3596
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:01,130
Uh,

3597
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:01,550
so,

3598
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:02,960
so does that not work ladder.

3599
01:35:03,150 --> 01:35:06,190
And that's what I did at the beginning
and that's why I call it tomorrow it's

3600
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:06,560
radio.

3601
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,810
But now I don't do
movie clips or anything.

3602
01:35:08,811 --> 01:35:09,470
I'll just,

3603
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:10,750
I'll take some stand up.

3604
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:11,893
Um,

3605
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:12,710
you know,

3606
01:35:12,710 --> 01:35:13,850
if somebody didn't know,

3607
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:14,750
uh,

3608
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:16,670
Hedberg Hedberg or something,

3609
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:17,750
he comes up in conversation.

3610
01:35:17,751 --> 01:35:18,620
Perfect example,

3611
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:19,221
you know,

3612
01:35:19,221 --> 01:35:21,830
to do a little sliver of
a couple of his jokes.

3613
01:35:21,831 --> 01:35:22,664
So it's just,

3614
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,390
I kind of approach it like if I was a,

3615
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:30,470
I'm a university professor
teaching a master class in comedy,

3616
01:35:30,501 --> 01:35:30,861
you know,

3617
01:35:30,861 --> 01:35:31,191
it's,

3618
01:35:31,191 --> 01:35:31,910
it's,

3619
01:35:31,910 --> 01:35:32,960
it's a lot of Comedians,

3620
01:35:32,961 --> 01:35:34,610
but a lot of also interesting people do.

3621
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:35,453
People I admire,

3622
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:35,721
you know,

3623
01:35:35,721 --> 01:35:37,620
like I admired Kim Dotcom.

3624
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:38,270
I,

3625
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:39,320
I sent him a message,

3626
01:35:39,410 --> 01:35:40,131
I got in touch with them.

3627
01:35:40,131 --> 01:35:41,360
Do you edit it all yourself?

3628
01:35:41,930 --> 01:35:42,560
Uh,

3629
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:43,490
my wife helps me.

3630
01:35:43,970 --> 01:35:44,660
She edits it.

3631
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:46,280
What do you use to put
everything together?

3632
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:48,950
What's the like pro tools?

3633
01:35:48,951 --> 01:35:49,610
What do you use?

3634
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:49,880
Oh,

3635
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:50,630
just garageband.

3636
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:52,580
Garageband said it all together.

3637
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:53,300
Great.

3638
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:54,260
Anybody can do,

3639
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:57,830
you can be your own Internet mogul
now you've got the technology.

3640
01:35:57,831 --> 01:35:58,530
You don't have to,

3641
01:35:58,530 --> 01:35:59,400
that's the video.

3642
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:01,230
This is from,

3643
01:36:01,290 --> 01:36:01,651
I mean,

3644
01:36:01,651 --> 01:36:02,980
I want to say like it work,

3645
01:36:02,981 --> 01:36:03,241
right?

3646
01:36:03,241 --> 01:36:08,010
You can't be any later than 2000
used to call himself Kim there.

3647
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:09,750
It was just Kim expert Kim.

3648
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:11,760
I don't know what his actual real name is.

3649
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:12,653
Kim Schmidt,

3650
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:14,190
but this is a him.

3651
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:15,540
He was something like that.

3652
01:36:15,541 --> 01:36:16,590
He's like a character.

3653
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:18,930
God.

3654
01:36:18,930 --> 01:36:19,710
He makes,

3655
01:36:19,710 --> 01:36:22,260
he makes rap songs and dance songs.

3656
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,400
That's the mega car that Ma,

3657
01:36:24,510 --> 01:36:25,800
how you knew what it was.

3658
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:26,833
Yeah,

3659
01:36:27,410 --> 01:36:28,160
I remember this.

3660
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,090
I remember this well.

3661
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:30,200
He had a whole thing.

3662
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:30,591
Yeah.

3663
01:36:30,591 --> 01:36:31,550
Like the guy gets out,

3664
01:36:31,551 --> 01:36:32,510
he gets on a speed boat.

3665
01:36:32,511 --> 01:36:34,040
He's just letting you know
he's a bad motherfucker.

3666
01:36:34,041 --> 01:36:36,750
He takes his crash car
to leave a faster boat.

3667
01:36:36,790 --> 01:36:37,371
Now I'm gone,

3668
01:36:37,371 --> 01:36:38,204
bitch,

3669
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:38,780
push.

3670
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:40,670
I'm like James Bond up
in this motherfucker.

3671
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:43,910
So he's a flying around
on the water in his boat

3672
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:47,300
and he presses the eject button.

3673
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:48,531
So this was his,

3674
01:36:48,531 --> 01:36:51,320
I guess his obsession
with all things mega.

3675
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:51,711
Yeah.

3676
01:36:51,711 --> 01:36:51,981
Look,

3677
01:36:51,981 --> 01:36:54,350
any lands on the bottom
of this helicopter.

3678
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,090
Then he lands on a building.

3679
01:36:59,140 --> 01:36:59,511
Microsoft,

3680
01:36:59,511 --> 01:37:00,344
Microsoft

3681
01:37:02,470 --> 01:37:03,770
was having sex with the building.

3682
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:06,230
It's sliding down the building,

3683
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:07,480
built.

3684
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:08,780
He's Bill Gates.

3685
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:09,980
He's going to shoot Bill Gates.

3686
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:11,350
What a great idea.

3687
01:37:11,410 --> 01:37:12,243
Oh my God.

3688
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:13,123
Oh my God.

3689
01:37:16,090 --> 01:37:16,511
Oh my God.

3690
01:37:16,511 --> 01:37:17,201
It guns down.

3691
01:37:17,201 --> 01:37:18,034
Bill Gates.

3692
01:37:18,610 --> 01:37:19,241
Bill Gates.

3693
01:37:19,241 --> 01:37:20,074
That's brutal

3694
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:22,811
to him.

3695
01:37:22,811 --> 01:37:23,644
It says this is,

3696
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:26,261
this is for winners.

3697
01:37:26,261 --> 01:37:27,094
Me.

3698
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:28,760
So Bill Gates

3699
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:31,550
peeing on the ground and it turns
out he didn't actually shoot him,

3700
01:37:31,551 --> 01:37:32,990
but he shot around him.

3701
01:37:32,991 --> 01:37:34,950
The word Linux you lane.

3702
01:37:35,130 --> 01:37:36,470
And that's so funny.

3703
01:37:38,570 --> 01:37:39,830
That's not the one that I saw.

3704
01:37:40,970 --> 01:37:41,570
I saw it.

3705
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:43,090
I'm glad he didn't kill Bill Gates.

3706
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:43,640
Yeah,

3707
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:46,160
I thought he was killing it was
like that was really twisted.

3708
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:47,001
Yeah,

3709
01:37:47,001 --> 01:37:47,301
he's,

3710
01:37:47,301 --> 01:37:47,870
he does.

3711
01:37:47,870 --> 01:37:49,670
These were all long time ago.

3712
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:50,390
This was like,

3713
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:51,880
there was nothing like
that on the Internet.

3714
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:53,510
People weren't doing it
on their own website.

3715
01:37:53,511 --> 01:37:54,470
It's really strange.

3716
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:55,333
Right.

3717
01:37:56,970 --> 01:37:57,760
Anyway,

3718
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,120
yeah.

3719
01:37:58,120 --> 01:37:58,511
Do you,

3720
01:37:58,511 --> 01:37:58,930
uh,

3721
01:37:58,930 --> 01:37:59,860
what do you do your,

3722
01:37:59,861 --> 01:38:00,350
um,

3723
01:38:00,350 --> 01:38:00,570
you,

3724
01:38:00,570 --> 01:38:04,360
you just edit it all yourself and put
it live or put it up on iTunes but you

3725
01:38:04,361 --> 01:38:06,540
don't do like a lot Ustream
version or anything like that?

3726
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:07,690
The cloud and uh,

3727
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:08,980
but I'm going to Ustream version,

3728
01:38:08,981 --> 01:38:10,210
like the video,

3729
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:14,260
little snippets of video
and put it on Youtube.

3730
01:38:14,261 --> 01:38:14,930
I,

3731
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:17,700
my youtube channel is King
of ha ha king of [inaudible]

3732
01:38:19,570 --> 01:38:20,330
and a,

3733
01:38:20,330 --> 01:38:23,300
it sounds like a middle man help ones.

3734
01:38:23,630 --> 01:38:23,811
Uh,

3735
01:38:23,811 --> 01:38:24,131
and I,

3736
01:38:24,131 --> 01:38:24,531
I didn't,

3737
01:38:24,531 --> 01:38:25,880
I didn't film Kim got calm.

3738
01:38:25,881 --> 01:38:28,430
I felt so privileged to be in
the guy's house when I got there.

3739
01:38:28,431 --> 01:38:30,800
I was enjoying just
meeting the guy so much.

3740
01:38:30,801 --> 01:38:31,070
I know.

3741
01:38:31,070 --> 01:38:31,903
I actually said,

3742
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:33,290
we don't need to do this,

3743
01:38:33,710 --> 01:38:33,981
bro.

3744
01:38:33,981 --> 01:38:34,910
I'm just happy to meet you.

3745
01:38:34,930 --> 01:38:35,640
Right.

3746
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:36,231
And I actually,

3747
01:38:36,231 --> 01:38:36,780
you know,

3748
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:40,220
I was just so glad to be sitting there
and talking to the guy and then he said,

3749
01:38:40,221 --> 01:38:40,341
no,

3750
01:38:40,341 --> 01:38:40,460
no,

3751
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:40,611
no.

3752
01:38:40,611 --> 01:38:41,001
You know,

3753
01:38:41,001 --> 01:38:41,450
um,

3754
01:38:41,450 --> 01:38:42,283
you know,

3755
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:43,020
please,

3756
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:43,310
you know,

3757
01:38:43,310 --> 01:38:44,120
if you want to,

3758
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:44,960
if you want to record

3759
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:48,670
the act of doing a podcast
makes conversations happen
that might not necessarily

3760
01:38:48,671 --> 01:38:48,910
how,

3761
01:38:48,910 --> 01:38:49,743
how like,

3762
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:50,923
like you and I,

3763
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:51,371
okay,

3764
01:38:51,371 --> 01:38:53,320
we might go have dinner somewhere,

3765
01:38:53,530 --> 01:38:54,280
but I might,

3766
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:54,580
you know,

3767
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:55,450
take a phone call.

3768
01:38:55,451 --> 01:38:56,650
You might go to take a leak,

3769
01:38:56,651 --> 01:38:56,801
you know,

3770
01:38:56,801 --> 01:39:00,010
we're not going to sit down for three
hours and just drink coffee and smoke a

3771
01:39:00,011 --> 01:39:02,080
little weed and just talk like this.

3772
01:39:02,081 --> 01:39:02,231
Like,

3773
01:39:02,231 --> 01:39:04,060
it's almost like you need this vehicle,

3774
01:39:04,330 --> 01:39:04,431
uh,

3775
01:39:04,431 --> 01:39:05,620
putting on a show to,

3776
01:39:05,621 --> 01:39:05,760
to,

3777
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:06,850
to get it out there,

3778
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:07,420
you know?

3779
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:08,080
Yeah.

3780
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:08,471
It's cool.

3781
01:39:08,471 --> 01:39:08,771
But my,

3782
01:39:08,771 --> 01:39:09,070
my,

3783
01:39:09,070 --> 01:39:10,360
my wife also achieved,

3784
01:39:10,361 --> 01:39:10,870
she's,

3785
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:11,681
she films a lot.

3786
01:39:11,681 --> 01:39:12,580
I've filmed a lot,

3787
01:39:12,581 --> 01:39:15,460
so we ain't got great stuff
with Stan hope and um,

3788
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:16,593
Steve,

3789
01:39:17,510 --> 01:39:17,910
uh,

3790
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:18,500
yeah.

3791
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:18,850
Um,

3792
01:39:18,850 --> 01:39:20,110
they're coming out a little faster now.

3793
01:39:20,380 --> 01:39:22,360
I've got a lot of backed up episodes.

3794
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:22,991
What's it man?

3795
01:39:22,991 --> 01:39:23,150
It's,

3796
01:39:23,150 --> 01:39:24,550
that's the beautiful thing about podcasts.

3797
01:39:24,551 --> 01:39:25,840
All you really need,

3798
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:27,400
if you want to do an audio podcast,

3799
01:39:27,401 --> 01:39:27,881
especially,

3800
01:39:27,881 --> 01:39:30,290
you just need an iPhone and you can do,

3801
01:39:30,330 --> 01:39:30,640
I've,

3802
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:32,380
we've done ones where Brian,

3803
01:39:32,381 --> 01:39:34,120
what kind of a editing did you have to do?

3804
01:39:34,121 --> 01:39:35,880
When I did those podcasts on the plans?

3805
01:39:35,881 --> 01:39:36,940
Did you have to do anything to it?

3806
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:37,510
No,

3807
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:39,760
I just cut off that
beginning and end and just,

3808
01:39:40,090 --> 01:39:40,780
it's amazing.

3809
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:44,290
And then put commercials on the
sound of the plane wasn't a,

3810
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:44,501
Oh,

3811
01:39:44,501 --> 01:39:45,334
it's Kinda cool.

3812
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:46,420
It's Kinda cool.

3813
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:47,253
It's in the background,

3814
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:47,771
you know?

3815
01:39:47,771 --> 01:39:48,221
And then,

3816
01:39:48,221 --> 01:39:48,401
you know,

3817
01:39:48,401 --> 01:39:52,150
like what I do is I'd hold the iPhone
between like me and Joey are me and Dunkin

3818
01:39:52,151 --> 01:39:53,500
and me and Ari or Brian.

3819
01:39:53,501 --> 01:39:56,260
And did we ever do one Bryan's
never do podcast on the planet.

3820
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:59,230
We should have that like a
regular episode when we do gigs.

3821
01:39:59,231 --> 01:40:00,430
Do podcasts on a plane.

3822
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:01,090
Absolutely.

3823
01:40:01,090 --> 01:40:01,370
Yeah,

3824
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:01,760
I did it.

3825
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:04,220
I did the Austin Moontower festival.

3826
01:40:04,550 --> 01:40:05,450
Was that a comedy festival?

3827
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:05,720
Yeah,

3828
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:06,261
it's great.

3829
01:40:06,261 --> 01:40:06,951
It's an Austin.

3830
01:40:06,951 --> 01:40:09,320
I just a second year and uh,

3831
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:10,700
I love Ari.

3832
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:11,390
He's awesome.

3833
01:40:11,390 --> 01:40:12,171
Oh my God.

3834
01:40:12,171 --> 01:40:13,850
Just his face makes me happy.

3835
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:15,470
I enjoy dead guys.

3836
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:17,390
I enjoy his company so much.

3837
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:18,410
And I did it.

3838
01:40:18,410 --> 01:40:22,850
I sat down and then it was having a great
conversation with him for my podcast

3839
01:40:23,090 --> 01:40:28,090
and then Marin walks out cause we were
on these balconies at the hotel and then

3840
01:40:28,131 --> 01:40:29,420
Marin sits down and then it's,

3841
01:40:29,421 --> 01:40:29,870
you know,

3842
01:40:29,870 --> 01:40:31,430
it comes all about all about marriage,

3843
01:40:31,810 --> 01:40:32,331
but there's,

3844
01:40:32,331 --> 01:40:33,320
I've got great video.

3845
01:40:33,370 --> 01:40:33,591
It did,

3846
01:40:33,591 --> 01:40:33,950
it really,

3847
01:40:33,950 --> 01:40:35,320
that is really what happened was,

3848
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:36,351
but Marin's great.

3849
01:40:36,351 --> 01:40:37,150
And the thing,

3850
01:40:37,150 --> 01:40:38,340
cause I was having this great,

3851
01:40:38,341 --> 01:40:41,810
I didn't know he had been like Orthodox
and that he had lived in Israel and

3852
01:40:41,811 --> 01:40:42,081
stuff.

3853
01:40:42,081 --> 01:40:42,930
So I'm like story,

3854
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:44,860
I'm asking him all these things that like,

3855
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:45,290
I just,

3856
01:40:45,290 --> 01:40:45,800
I,

3857
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:46,131
you know,

3858
01:40:46,131 --> 01:40:47,180
what's the squiggly,

3859
01:40:47,181 --> 01:40:47,810
uh,

3860
01:40:47,810 --> 01:40:48,710
sideburns mean?

3861
01:40:48,711 --> 01:40:50,520
What's the Tassel on the pants thing mean?

3862
01:40:51,380 --> 01:40:52,700
What's with the big fuzzy hat?

3863
01:40:52,701 --> 01:40:56,500
So that Ari's like Ari's totally knocking
him down and he's totally school me

3864
01:40:56,790 --> 01:40:57,220
on,

3865
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:57,611
on,

3866
01:40:57,611 --> 01:40:58,030
uh,

3867
01:40:58,030 --> 01:40:58,481
all these,

3868
01:40:58,481 --> 01:40:58,721
uh,

3869
01:40:58,721 --> 01:40:59,800
these questions that I had.

3870
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:01,210
And then Marin comes out.

3871
01:41:01,390 --> 01:41:01,930
There it is.

3872
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:02,230
Boom.

3873
01:41:02,230 --> 01:41:05,260
Did Marin think that he was supposed to
be there or they're just coming to Mary

3874
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:07,720
knew we were recording
the first like 20 minutes.

3875
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:08,583
Oh,

3876
01:41:09,550 --> 01:41:10,410
compensation,

3877
01:41:10,660 --> 01:41:14,150
front of a laptop and then he's
probably in the groove now.

3878
01:41:14,660 --> 01:41:15,830
He's a funny cat man.

3879
01:41:15,831 --> 01:41:16,190
He's a,

3880
01:41:16,190 --> 01:41:17,600
he's become a different dude.

3881
01:41:17,601 --> 01:41:18,434
It's interesting.

3882
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:22,670
It's cool watching a guy
finally drop some of the anger,

3883
01:41:22,671 --> 01:41:22,860
like

3884
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:23,790
getting success.

3885
01:41:23,791 --> 01:41:24,150
Yeah,

3886
01:41:24,150 --> 01:41:25,110
it's great when somebody,

3887
01:41:25,111 --> 01:41:25,560
uh,

3888
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:26,393
yeah,

3889
01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:27,750
getting into it with people.

3890
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:28,171
He,

3891
01:41:28,171 --> 01:41:28,561
Michael,

3892
01:41:28,561 --> 01:41:33,000
Ian Black and him were going back and
forth on Twitter or are they doing oh well

3893
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:37,710
my Michael Ian Black was
dominating Marin on Twitter.

3894
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:38,460
Oh really?

3895
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:38,920
Oh,

3896
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:39,810
I don't believe that's right.

3897
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:42,160
I don't care for it.

3898
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:43,833
They've done it before.

3899
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:45,220
Twitter slap downs.

3900
01:41:45,221 --> 01:41:47,440
When comedians get all
bitchy with each other,

3901
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:48,730
it seems to be,

3902
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:49,421
I mean,

3903
01:41:49,421 --> 01:41:50,070
we're on the word,

3904
01:41:50,070 --> 01:41:51,570
the lowest rung on the Showbiz.

3905
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:52,451
Slacker man.

3906
01:41:52,451 --> 01:41:53,760
It's like dough lets you know.

3907
01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:54,140
How about,

3908
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:57,370
how about a little malware brotherhood
fellows could have easily been fucking

3909
01:41:57,371 --> 01:41:57,581
around,

3910
01:41:57,581 --> 01:41:59,120
but it just didn't seem like it

3911
01:42:00,730 --> 01:42:03,600
told a great story that
I had asked him about it.

3912
01:42:03,601 --> 01:42:03,861
It's,

3913
01:42:03,861 --> 01:42:06,370
it's a little different
the way he tells it,

3914
01:42:06,371 --> 01:42:07,480
but the way I remembered it,

3915
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:08,650
um,

3916
01:42:08,650 --> 01:42:08,870
you know,

3917
01:42:08,870 --> 01:42:09,430
Marin,

3918
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:11,200
he'd only been doing comedy
for a couple of years.

3919
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:12,160
He moves to la,

3920
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:13,930
he's a doorman at the comedy store.

3921
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:18,370
He's living at the comedy store house
and Kinison is massive at the time.

3922
01:42:18,371 --> 01:42:21,790
And Kennison like to come by and
party and everything and Marin's like,

3923
01:42:21,791 --> 01:42:22,031
you know,

3924
01:42:22,031 --> 01:42:23,560
only been to a comedy
for a couple of years.

3925
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:24,581
And,

3926
01:42:24,581 --> 01:42:25,240
um,

3927
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:30,160
he went to pick up a college friend of
his at the airport and he comes back to

3928
01:42:30,161 --> 01:42:35,161
the house and he comes in and Kennison
is standing on his bed pissing and Marin

3929
01:42:35,501 --> 01:42:36,760
turns to his buddy and he goes,

3930
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:38,080
I told you I knew him.

3931
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,340
I heard Ken was a real piece of shit.

3932
01:42:44,350 --> 01:42:45,100
He wasn't,

3933
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:46,840
he was a bad dude by the way.

3934
01:42:47,210 --> 01:42:48,860
Got To remember this a to say this,

3935
01:42:48,861 --> 01:42:49,220
uh,

3936
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:51,710
our IISHA fears new comedy central show,

3937
01:42:51,711 --> 01:42:53,300

3938
01:42:53,660 --> 01:42:54,260
Um,

3939
01:42:54,260 --> 01:42:54,711

3940
01:42:54,711 --> 01:42:54,920

01:43:05,211 --> 01:43:05,931
I watched it.

3946
01:43:05,931 --> 01:43:06,470
It's,

3947
01:43:06,470 --> 01:43:07,340
it's brilliant.

3948
01:43:07,370 --> 01:43:09,350
Especially the opening part of it.

3949
01:43:09,351 --> 01:43:09,861
There's like this,

3950
01:43:09,861 --> 01:43:11,060

3951
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:12,073

it's on the comedy central.

3954
01:43:14,770 --> 01:43:16,580
A page on youtube,

3955
01:43:17,210 --> 01:43:18,440
which is just comedy central.

3956
01:43:18,620 --> 01:43:19,453
And um,

3957
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:19,731
it's,

3958
01:43:19,731 --> 01:43:20,810
this is not happening.

3959
01:43:20,811 --> 01:43:22,340
Tj Miller has a seizure.

3960
01:43:22,370 --> 01:43:23,330
This is not happening.

3961
01:43:23,510 --> 01:43:24,071
Just see the,

3962
01:43:24,071 --> 01:43:25,190
the beginning of the opening,

3963
01:43:25,191 --> 01:43:26,870
a animated video,

3964
01:43:27,050 --> 01:43:31,220
whoever did it is a bad motherfucker cause
it looks really cool and they decided

3965
01:43:31,221 --> 01:43:31,611
to do it.

3966
01:43:31,611 --> 01:43:33,170
It looks like they did it in a strip club.

3967
01:43:33,770 --> 01:43:35,240
It looks like they did
it in like one of those.

3968
01:43:35,610 --> 01:43:35,761
Yeah,

3969
01:43:35,761 --> 01:43:36,001
it's a,

3970
01:43:36,001 --> 01:43:36,331
it's a,

3971
01:43:36,331 --> 01:43:37,170
it's a Cheetah's.

3972
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:39,630
Oh is it cheese or where we're in Atlanta.

3973
01:43:40,170 --> 01:43:41,940
I know there's like a Cheetah is here,

3974
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:45,360
but that's where like Sam does a
lot of comedy shows that really,

3975
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:46,493
Oh that's brilliant.

3976
01:43:46,810 --> 01:43:47,280
Yeah.

3977
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:48,570
How would those shows those fun?

3978
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:49,350
Yeah.

3979
01:43:49,350 --> 01:43:49,890
Great.

3980
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:52,310
Look at this opening in the least

3981
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:53,960
amount of words possible.

3982
01:43:54,790 --> 01:43:56,010
You're jumped out as HR.

3983
01:43:56,420 --> 01:43:57,253
That was going to happen.

3984
01:44:00,410 --> 01:44:01,243
Check this out.

3985
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:07,010
This is the opening animation for
those newer saw three dimensional shits

3986
01:44:07,011 --> 01:44:07,520
flowing.

3987
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:10,550
The air is really cool.

3988
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:15,081
Welcome to,

3989
01:44:15,081 --> 01:44:15,950
this is not happening.

3990
01:44:15,951 --> 01:44:20,410
Present crazy nights over a
bunch of comedians tell stories.

3991
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:21,633
Similar subject.

3992
01:44:21,710 --> 01:44:22,100
So this,

3993
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:22,940
this is an idea

3994
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:24,390
Ari had a,

3995
01:44:24,391 --> 01:44:26,760
that he came up with a long ass time ago,

3996
01:44:27,030 --> 01:44:29,220
I think as like a writing exercise.

3997
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:30,960
I mean I think that was his idea.

3998
01:44:30,961 --> 01:44:34,200
Just to have a different kind of show
where you instead of just do like

3999
01:44:34,201 --> 01:44:34,950
hardcore,

4000
01:44:34,950 --> 01:44:36,180
like set up punchline,

4001
01:44:36,210 --> 01:44:37,043
you know,

4002
01:44:37,230 --> 01:44:38,190
created bits.

4003
01:44:38,610 --> 01:44:41,130
He wanted people just tell wacky stories.

4004
01:44:41,131 --> 01:44:45,120
Like the one time that like Bert Kreischer
has a fucking story but getting so

4005
01:44:45,121 --> 01:44:50,121
drunk that he's over his girlfriend's
father's house and he's the guy walks down

4006
01:44:50,941 --> 01:44:54,540
into the living room while he's
pissing on the dining room table.

4007
01:44:55,140 --> 01:44:57,840
Like standing there with his dick
out on the dining room table pissing.

4008
01:44:58,640 --> 01:44:59,473
Hmm.

4009
01:45:01,010 --> 01:45:02,360
We've all had a little too much to drink.

4010
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:03,380
Yeah.

4011
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:03,710
That's,

4012
01:45:03,710 --> 01:45:05,220
that's some next level shit already.

4013
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:07,730
Storyteller nights at the
Austin Moontower festival.

4014
01:45:07,731 --> 01:45:08,031
He did,

4015
01:45:08,031 --> 01:45:08,240
uh,

4016
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:08,420
uh,

4017
01:45:08,420 --> 01:45:09,500
drug story.

4018
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:10,490
Yeah,

4019
01:45:10,490 --> 01:45:11,121
I told that.

4020
01:45:11,121 --> 01:45:11,690
Um,

4021
01:45:11,690 --> 01:45:13,160
Dalai Lama tail.

4022
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:14,810
That's a great story.

4023
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:15,981
Yeah.

4024
01:45:15,981 --> 01:45:17,480
Those are these things that already does.

4025
01:45:17,481 --> 01:45:17,631
They're,

4026
01:45:17,631 --> 01:45:18,261
they're really fun.

4027
01:45:18,261 --> 01:45:18,830
I love that.

4028
01:45:18,830 --> 01:45:19,663
And it really interesting.

4029
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:20,870
But sometimes people cheat.

4030
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:26,270
I've talked to already about just
going to Israel and doing shows and um,

4031
01:45:26,780 --> 01:45:28,100
and I just talked to Moshe Kasher.

4032
01:45:28,101 --> 01:45:30,740
He had played this club that I
wanted to look into and he said,

4033
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:32,030
you have to be squeaky clean.

4034
01:45:32,270 --> 01:45:33,170
What would be the fun of that?

4035
01:45:35,290 --> 01:45:36,610
What kind of world that you live in it,

4036
01:45:36,611 --> 01:45:37,920
it's just we've all got handle,

4037
01:45:37,940 --> 01:45:38,430
you know,

4038
01:45:38,430 --> 01:45:42,170
fucking religious tension
and fucking suicide bombers,

4039
01:45:42,171 --> 01:45:43,420
but they can't handle a little dick.

4040
01:45:43,490 --> 01:45:43,880
Yup.

4041
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:44,211
Yeah.

4042
01:45:44,211 --> 01:45:45,044
What the fuck?

4043
01:45:45,350 --> 01:45:47,030
That's absolutely preposterous.

4044
01:45:47,690 --> 01:45:49,040
That actually hurts my feelings.

4045
01:45:49,130 --> 01:45:49,963
It does.

4046
01:45:50,380 --> 01:45:51,440
It's going to be clean.

4047
01:45:51,460 --> 01:45:52,293
Why?

4048
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:53,493
Why?

4049
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:54,321
What do you do?

4050
01:45:54,321 --> 01:45:56,120
Are you going to live forever
if you don't say fuck,

4051
01:45:56,540 --> 01:45:58,790
what are you doing that you
would need to join this more?

4052
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:03,440
If everything's fucking
sanitized and like what?

4053
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:04,850
Like all due respect.

4054
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,980
What keeps a guy like
Seinfeld doing stand up?

4055
01:46:08,060 --> 01:46:08,960
Do you know anything about him?

4056
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:09,500
No,

4057
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:09,861
I don't.

4058
01:46:09,861 --> 01:46:11,030
I know what kind of cereal he likes.

4059
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:11,940
He likes Porsche's.

4060
01:46:12,010 --> 01:46:12,321
Let me know.

4061
01:46:12,321 --> 01:46:12,860
He likes portion.

4062
01:46:12,860 --> 01:46:13,280
Yes.

4063
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:14,660
It's like he's got like a hundred cars,

4064
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:16,880
some crazy Porsche fetish,

4065
01:46:17,090 --> 01:46:17,600
you know,

4066
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,040
drives a lot of old ones and shit.

4067
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:20,980
Man.

4068
01:46:20,980 --> 01:46:23,120
I know he's a great comic and you know,

4069
01:46:23,210 --> 01:46:26,210
he's a great joke writer
who's got great delivery,

4070
01:46:26,211 --> 01:46:30,560
but he's got that one
observational one layer style.

4071
01:46:30,590 --> 01:46:31,590
Like there's no side

4072
01:46:32,150 --> 01:46:34,040
when I have children at won't
allow them to watch him.

4073
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:36,240
I would never want my kids to,

4074
01:46:36,241 --> 01:46:37,270
I relate that kind of comment,

4075
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:40,913
but

4076
01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:43,011
look it online,

4077
01:46:43,011 --> 01:46:43,551
pornography,

4078
01:46:43,551 --> 01:46:43,881
kids,

4079
01:46:43,881 --> 01:46:44,714
whatever you want.

4080
01:46:45,170 --> 01:46:45,711
You watch them.

4081
01:46:45,711 --> 01:46:46,700
Old Carland tapes.

4082
01:46:47,090 --> 01:46:48,320
No Seinfeld in this house.

4083
01:46:48,370 --> 01:46:49,203
Where does that other,

4084
01:46:51,750 --> 01:46:52,980
I had to go to this store.

4085
01:46:52,990 --> 01:46:54,150
I go to the grocery store.

4086
01:46:54,210 --> 01:46:55,680
I'm just picking up a couple of things.

4087
01:46:55,770 --> 01:46:56,371
Jerry goes,

4088
01:46:56,371 --> 01:46:57,890
go to the store jokes.

4089
01:46:58,060 --> 01:47:00,060
It's an air who cheese?

4090
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:02,580
I just run down to the milk
because they know each other.

4091
01:47:03,190 --> 01:47:03,850
Oh,

4092
01:47:03,850 --> 01:47:04,680
I know.

4093
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:06,540
We were both milk and I love you.

4094
01:47:06,541 --> 01:47:07,650
You've grown up your cheese,

4095
01:47:08,650 --> 01:47:09,081
you know,

4096
01:47:09,081 --> 01:47:09,300
every,

4097
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:12,360
all bilk starts off
cheese starts off as milk.

4098
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:13,740
When she sees milk,

4099
01:47:13,741 --> 01:47:15,030
does it remember it's old friends.

4100
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:15,841
Look at you.

4101
01:47:15,841 --> 01:47:16,674
You moved.

4102
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:17,840
I should clarify.

4103
01:47:17,841 --> 01:47:18,260
He,

4104
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:19,093
uh,

4105
01:47:19,170 --> 01:47:21,540
I met him once and I didn't care for him.

4106
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:23,193
I thought he was,

4107
01:47:23,220 --> 01:47:24,740
you know what happened?

4108
01:47:25,490 --> 01:47:26,690
It was at the comedy cellar.

4109
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:27,501
It was 98,

4110
01:47:27,501 --> 01:47:28,100
99.

4111
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:28,933
I was living there.

4112
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:30,080
And um,

4113
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:31,151
I,

4114
01:47:31,151 --> 01:47:31,690
you know,

4115
01:47:31,690 --> 01:47:32,361
the seller,

4116
01:47:32,361 --> 01:47:33,380
everybody goes to the seller,

4117
01:47:33,381 --> 01:47:33,800
you know,

4118
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:34,633
at the end of the night.

4119
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:36,830
And I had a sat there and I get that,

4120
01:47:36,831 --> 01:47:37,041
you know,

4121
01:47:37,041 --> 01:47:37,491
it's,

4122
01:47:37,491 --> 01:47:37,731
you know,

4123
01:47:37,731 --> 01:47:38,541
it's a small club.

4124
01:47:38,541 --> 01:47:40,430
There's a table in the
back where Comedians,

4125
01:47:40,550 --> 01:47:41,090
um,

4126
01:47:41,090 --> 01:47:43,310
go on or before they go on.

4127
01:47:44,030 --> 01:47:44,811
And I get there and every,

4128
01:47:44,811 --> 01:47:46,040
all the comedians are in the hallway.

4129
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:47,720
Nobody's at the table and the,

4130
01:47:47,721 --> 01:47:47,841
Oh,

4131
01:47:47,841 --> 01:47:48,561
Jerry's here.

4132
01:47:48,561 --> 01:47:49,820
And so I go back,

4133
01:47:49,821 --> 01:47:50,481
I'm on next,

4134
01:47:50,481 --> 01:47:52,490
I sit down and give
them a little head nod.

4135
01:47:52,491 --> 01:47:53,000
Hey,

4136
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,640
I liked the guy who up to that time,

4137
01:47:55,700 --> 01:47:57,290
I could see him while I was on,

4138
01:47:57,291 --> 01:47:59,270
I did 20 minutes and a,

4139
01:47:59,271 --> 01:48:00,260
I had a great set.

4140
01:48:00,290 --> 01:48:01,040
I know that.

4141
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:03,320
And then the next night he's at the,

4142
01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:03,680
uh,

4143
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:07,580
they had the Mediterranean restaurant
upstairs and I get there early to do my

4144
01:48:07,581 --> 01:48:07,911
set.

4145
01:48:07,911 --> 01:48:08,630
And,

4146
01:48:08,630 --> 01:48:09,463
um,

4147
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:11,180
I see Collin Quinn at the bar,

4148
01:48:11,210 --> 01:48:12,043
he's a buddy of mine.

4149
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:13,041
And I go over to,

4150
01:48:13,041 --> 01:48:13,461
Hey Collin,

4151
01:48:13,461 --> 01:48:13,811
how are ya?

4152
01:48:13,811 --> 01:48:14,121
And he goes,

4153
01:48:14,121 --> 01:48:14,271
Hey,

4154
01:48:14,271 --> 01:48:14,511
you know,

4155
01:48:14,511 --> 01:48:18,710
Jerry and Jerry sit in there honker and
over a plate of chicken wings and he's

4156
01:48:18,711 --> 01:48:21,680
holding a chicken wing and
he looks me up and down.

4157
01:48:21,681 --> 01:48:22,490
And he goes,

4158
01:48:22,490 --> 01:48:25,130
isn't that the same sport
coat you had on yesterday?

4159
01:48:26,390 --> 01:48:27,223
And I go,

4160
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:29,630
I only had one season on NBC.

4161
01:48:29,631 --> 01:48:30,464
Jerry,

4162
01:48:30,980 --> 01:48:34,640
you might be able to afford a different
jacket every night of the week,

4163
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:36,230
but I only had one season.

4164
01:48:36,830 --> 01:48:40,040
And he just like shrugged and he went
back through his chicken wings and it's

4165
01:48:40,041 --> 01:48:40,490
like,

4166
01:48:40,490 --> 01:48:41,323
you know,

4167
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:45,350
a guy with that much money
to like seriously look
someone up and down and like

4168
01:48:45,410 --> 01:48:46,700
criticized their clothing.

4169
01:48:46,940 --> 01:48:49,540
There was guys in my high school
that thought they were funny.

4170
01:48:49,610 --> 01:48:50,443
That's all they did.

4171
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:52,040
It criticized peoples.

4172
01:48:52,250 --> 01:48:52,491
You know,

4173
01:48:52,491 --> 01:48:53,600
some people don't have money.

4174
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:55,460
I see some people having a tough time,

4175
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:55,731
hey,

4176
01:48:55,731 --> 01:48:56,211
I'm sorry.

4177
01:48:56,211 --> 01:48:57,010
You know,

4178
01:48:57,010 --> 01:48:59,120
we didn't get the fucking
wash the clothes or whatever,

4179
01:48:59,121 --> 01:48:59,930
you know.

4180
01:48:59,930 --> 01:49:00,141
Uh,

4181
01:49:00,141 --> 01:49:03,350
but I always thought it was really
cheap when people like just pick apart

4182
01:49:03,351 --> 01:49:04,850
someone's appearance.

4183
01:49:04,851 --> 01:49:05,631
That's not comedy.

4184
01:49:05,631 --> 01:49:06,710
That's like being a bully.

4185
01:49:06,860 --> 01:49:07,510
What do you know?

4186
01:49:07,510 --> 01:49:08,050
Yeah.

4187
01:49:08,050 --> 01:49:13,050
And it had only works if you're not aware
of the impact that it has on another

4188
01:49:13,571 --> 01:49:14,020
person.

4189
01:49:14,020 --> 01:49:17,740
Because as soon as you are aware of the
impact that has on the other person and

4190
01:49:17,741 --> 01:49:18,574
you do it anyway,

4191
01:49:18,820 --> 01:49:20,290
you know like non instigated,

4192
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:22,690
you start off like picking
on a guy's wardrobe,

4193
01:49:22,990 --> 01:49:24,440
you're a Douche bag like this.

4194
01:49:24,441 --> 01:49:25,274
There's no,

4195
01:49:25,420 --> 01:49:30,420
but in his defense that is a style of
like comedy interaction in New York.

4196
01:49:31,090 --> 01:49:35,200
Everybody criticizes everybody and that
they do it all the time and maybe he

4197
01:49:35,201 --> 01:49:38,290
just wanted you like to know
that you were like welcome.

4198
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:38,891
Wow.

4199
01:49:38,891 --> 01:49:39,880
And I took it the wrong way.

4200
01:49:39,910 --> 01:49:40,743
Sorry Jerry.

4201
01:49:41,410 --> 01:49:42,640
This is possible.

4202
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:46,180
I mean that's some chicken
never heard of the guy being no,

4203
01:49:46,570 --> 01:49:46,901
no.

4204
01:49:46,901 --> 01:49:48,250
I you see him interviewed

4205
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:49,120
a thousand times.

4206
01:49:49,121 --> 01:49:52,720
You'd get an idea like Alec Baldwin
going to have to start watching that show

4207
01:49:52,721 --> 01:49:54,640
and then see Alec Baldwin
yelling at you for something.

4208
01:49:55,540 --> 01:49:56,290
Yeah.

4209
01:49:56,290 --> 01:49:57,010
You know what I'm saying?

4210
01:49:57,010 --> 01:49:59,200
Like Alec Baldwin seems
like he's a fucking hothead.

4211
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:00,130
It tightly wound.

4212
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:01,120
But Jerry Seinfeld,

4213
01:50:01,121 --> 01:50:03,760
could you ever see Jerry Seinfeld
screaming at a flight attendant?

4214
01:50:04,210 --> 01:50:04,780
No,

4215
01:50:04,780 --> 01:50:05,110
no,

4216
01:50:05,110 --> 01:50:05,550
no.

4217
01:50:05,550 --> 01:50:06,040
Yeah,

4218
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:07,420
I just don't think he's a Dick.

4219
01:50:07,421 --> 01:50:08,254
I don't think he's got it.

4220
01:50:08,340 --> 01:50:10,990
He might make a snide
comment here and again,

4221
01:50:10,991 --> 01:50:12,400
but so you go back,

4222
01:50:12,430 --> 01:50:13,540
we did all routes.

4223
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:14,350
A few off.

4224
01:50:14,350 --> 01:50:15,330
I'll let my kids watch him.

4225
01:50:17,770 --> 01:50:18,640
I love Seinfeld.

4226
01:50:18,650 --> 01:50:19,483
I liked the show.

4227
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:21,370
I think he's his book.

4228
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:22,170
It's good.

4229
01:50:22,170 --> 01:50:23,980
I don't get the end up.

4230
01:50:23,981 --> 01:50:25,540
I think his book is just as act.

4231
01:50:25,770 --> 01:50:26,380
Yeah,

4232
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:27,910
I think you translate
that to think in comedy.

4233
01:50:27,911 --> 01:50:28,421
It's like always,

4234
01:50:28,421 --> 01:50:29,050
you know,

4235
01:50:29,050 --> 01:50:30,520
when I talked to stand up and stand up,

4236
01:50:30,521 --> 01:50:31,354
did my thing,

4237
01:50:31,510 --> 01:50:32,343
uh,

4238
01:50:32,350 --> 01:50:32,920
who was it?

4239
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:34,870
Somebody like David Cross
was rude to everyone.

4240
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:37,540
So he told me stories like
you can always remember,

4241
01:50:37,570 --> 01:50:39,290
you always remember like who was it?

4242
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:41,170
Dig Tia and comedy when
you were coming up.

4243
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:41,710
Yeah,

4244
01:50:41,710 --> 01:50:43,730
I forgot that cross
story that he tells that.

4245
01:50:43,731 --> 01:50:45,730
So fucking rough story.

4246
01:50:45,850 --> 01:50:46,980
It's a rough story and it was,

4247
01:50:47,010 --> 01:50:47,690
you know,

4248
01:50:47,690 --> 01:50:51,910
you know guys can get Douchey
if you guys can get Douchey,

4249
01:50:51,911 --> 01:50:52,690
but they didn't.

4250
01:50:52,690 --> 01:50:53,081
That's the thing.

4251
01:50:53,081 --> 01:50:54,260
You walk around as a comedian and you say,

4252
01:50:54,290 --> 01:50:54,431
oh,

4253
01:50:54,431 --> 01:50:54,971
we're all like,

4254
01:50:54,971 --> 01:50:55,181
you know,

4255
01:50:55,181 --> 01:50:55,691
brothers.

4256
01:50:55,691 --> 01:50:55,960
No,

4257
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:57,010
not everybody looks at it that way.

4258
01:50:57,270 --> 01:50:58,470
Most of us do though.

4259
01:50:58,610 --> 01:51:01,270
TheW and the ones that do are the ones
that you enjoy hanging out with the

4260
01:51:01,310 --> 01:51:05,490
really self obsessed crazy ones that
aren't about the camaraderie of stand up.

4261
01:51:05,910 --> 01:51:08,550
Those are the ones that wind up kicking
themselves in the Dick or stepping on

4262
01:51:08,551 --> 01:51:09,300
their own foot.

4263
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:10,340
You know there's,

4264
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:12,000
there's the silly ones there.

4265
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:13,210
They would have dummies like you,

4266
01:51:13,220 --> 01:51:17,280
you wouldn't be any less funny if you
just weren't an asshole to your fellow

4267
01:51:17,281 --> 01:51:18,000
comics.

4268
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,080
It wouldn't make any less funny.

4269
01:51:19,081 --> 01:51:21,180
Didn't buy the open letter
to Larry the cable guy.

4270
01:51:21,330 --> 01:51:22,140
Okay.

4271
01:51:22,140 --> 01:51:23,190
It wouldn't make you less funny.

4272
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:26,370
It's not like you know
you're going gangster,

4273
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:27,990
but calling out Larry the cable guy.

4274
01:51:28,290 --> 01:51:29,370
Dan Whitney is a very nice guy.

4275
01:51:29,371 --> 01:51:31,740
He's a very nice guy and I
started out with him in Florida.

4276
01:51:31,741 --> 01:51:32,280
Great Guy.

4277
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:35,790
There's a lot of other fucked up shit
out there in the world that you should

4278
01:51:35,791 --> 01:51:40,110
probably be concentrating on before you
concentrate on the Larry the cable guy.

4279
01:51:40,770 --> 01:51:41,020
Yes.

4280
01:51:41,020 --> 01:51:45,860
It's just right where he's a nice fucking
guy and he has delicious potato chips.

4281
01:51:46,340 --> 01:51:47,173
Really?

4282
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:49,100
Brian telephones even more now.

4283
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:50,211
I heard that he has,

4284
01:51:50,211 --> 01:51:52,700
not only does he have like
a delicious potato chips,

4285
01:51:52,701 --> 01:51:53,990
he has like delicious food,

4286
01:51:53,991 --> 01:51:55,580
like hamburger helper type shit.

4287
01:51:55,610 --> 01:51:56,000
Oh really?

4288
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:56,491
He's coming down with,

4289
01:51:56,491 --> 01:51:57,440
it owns food products.

4290
01:51:57,880 --> 01:51:58,930
Cable Guy Larry,

4291
01:51:58,931 --> 01:52:02,560
the cable guy has a
cheeseburger potato chip.

4292
01:52:02,770 --> 01:52:04,630
It tastes like cheeseburgers.

4293
01:52:05,050 --> 01:52:05,831
Exactly.

4294
01:52:05,831 --> 01:52:06,551
Like cheeseburgers.

4295
01:52:06,551 --> 01:52:07,900
Like with mustard on it.

4296
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:08,920
Relish.

4297
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:10,540
It's fucking delicious.

4298
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:11,880
And why you're eating it.

4299
01:52:11,890 --> 01:52:12,600
You're like,

4300
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:14,170
I'm going to eat one more and that's it.

4301
01:52:14,171 --> 01:52:15,004
Because I think,

4302
01:52:15,010 --> 01:52:15,431
I don't know.

4303
01:52:15,431 --> 01:52:16,450
What the fuck is it?

4304
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:20,020
I don't know what kind of Voodoo they're
doing on me that a potato chip tastes

4305
01:52:20,021 --> 01:52:20,141
like.

4306
01:52:20,141 --> 01:52:21,220
I just hated it in and out.

4307
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:22,870
It's very strange.

4308
01:52:23,260 --> 01:52:24,071
Not In and out,

4309
01:52:24,071 --> 01:52:25,960
but definitely Wendy's.

4310
01:52:26,060 --> 01:52:27,580
It's fucking delicious.

4311
01:52:28,110 --> 01:52:29,260
It's really good.

4312
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:29,951
It's like you're,

4313
01:52:29,951 --> 01:52:33,070
you're eating a potato chip that
tastes just like eating a cheeseburger.

4314
01:52:33,071 --> 01:52:33,580
It's so weird,

4315
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:33,940
but it's,

4316
01:52:33,940 --> 01:52:34,773
God,

4317
01:52:36,210 --> 01:52:37,510
I can't be a smart move.

4318
01:52:37,930 --> 01:52:39,040
I can't be a smart move.

4319
01:52:40,970 --> 01:52:41,790
So hungry now.

4320
01:52:41,790 --> 01:52:41,971
Oh,

4321
01:52:41,971 --> 01:52:43,300
I got you with the fucking Larry,

4322
01:52:43,301 --> 01:52:44,080
the cable guy.

4323
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:44,913
Potato chips.

4324
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:45,980
But I think

4325
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:47,300
David Cross is just a,

4326
01:52:47,330 --> 01:52:48,860
he's just a volatile artists.

4327
01:52:48,890 --> 01:52:50,690
There were the same thing
that makes them great.

4328
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:51,601
Right.

4329
01:52:51,601 --> 01:52:52,150
I know David,

4330
01:52:52,150 --> 01:52:53,340
he's always been nice to me.

4331
01:52:53,341 --> 01:52:54,090
I mean it's always see,

4332
01:52:54,090 --> 01:52:55,620
depends on,

4333
01:52:55,640 --> 01:52:55,940
you know,

4334
01:52:55,940 --> 01:52:56,480
who you,

4335
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:57,060
who,

4336
01:52:57,060 --> 01:52:57,450
who,

4337
01:52:57,450 --> 01:53:02,010
who personal your experience with personal
people that you meet and deal with.

4338
01:53:02,090 --> 01:53:02,640
You know,

4339
01:53:02,640 --> 01:53:03,650
Dave's never been anything.

4340
01:53:03,651 --> 01:53:04,484
I've heard some people,

4341
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:05,101
I've met them,

4342
01:53:05,101 --> 01:53:06,360
they were the nicest people in the world.

4343
01:53:06,361 --> 01:53:07,194
And vice versa.

4344
01:53:07,470 --> 01:53:08,161
David's cool to me.

4345
01:53:08,161 --> 01:53:09,480
Even after I did fear factor,

4346
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:09,970
which,

4347
01:53:09,970 --> 01:53:10,231
you know,

4348
01:53:10,231 --> 01:53:12,420
if anybody was like taking
the high brow approach,

4349
01:53:12,421 --> 01:53:16,670
that'd be the time to think I was a loser
serving people animal decks and then

4350
01:53:16,671 --> 01:53:17,160
I,

4351
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:17,700
you know,

4352
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:18,660
just show us the classic,

4353
01:53:18,790 --> 01:53:19,800
what's classic for me.

4354
01:53:19,830 --> 01:53:22,440
I told you the last time
I was on the shot that,

4355
01:53:23,060 --> 01:53:23,641
that uh,

4356
01:53:23,641 --> 01:53:27,590
the magazine industry in this
country collapsed joke went down.

4357
01:53:28,170 --> 01:53:28,351
Well,

4358
01:53:28,351 --> 01:53:29,430
I'm one of the few people on Earth.

4359
01:53:29,431 --> 01:53:32,330
They could say I lost the job
because people had a drink cop.

4360
01:53:33,690 --> 01:53:34,830
It's not a lot of people that,

4361
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:35,850
you know,

4362
01:53:35,850 --> 01:53:37,080
not a lot of people that can say that,

4363
01:53:37,170 --> 01:53:38,370
why'd you lose your last job?

4364
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:39,061
Uh,

4365
01:53:39,061 --> 01:53:40,350
we were making people drink calm.

4366
01:53:41,300 --> 01:53:42,330
Maca wasn't buying it.

4367
01:53:43,530 --> 01:53:44,101
Check this out,

4368
01:53:44,101 --> 01:53:49,020
Larry the cable guy at
dinner and get her done.

4369
01:53:50,220 --> 01:53:51,570
You want a body like mine?

4370
01:53:51,630 --> 01:53:52,590
Look at the reviews

4371
01:53:56,270 --> 01:53:57,290
I ever boughten.

4372
01:53:58,640 --> 01:53:59,220
Oh,

4373
01:53:59,220 --> 01:53:59,791
back it up.

4374
01:53:59,791 --> 01:54:00,511
The first one,

4375
01:54:00,511 --> 01:54:00,991
Star.

4376
01:54:00,991 --> 01:54:01,824
What does the purse,

4377
01:54:01,850 --> 01:54:02,390
I says,

4378
01:54:02,390 --> 01:54:02,551
Oh,

4379
01:54:02,551 --> 01:54:05,490
does anybody remember Larry's
previous was on your recipe?

4380
01:54:08,850 --> 01:54:11,340
I can't recommend anyone
buying this product.

4381
01:54:11,341 --> 01:54:11,621
Ever Sing,

4382
01:54:11,621 --> 01:54:14,760
seen his calm to retune a
comedy routine on Poop Lasagna.

4383
01:54:15,990 --> 01:54:19,050
Maybe they just were David Cross fans.

4384
01:54:19,590 --> 01:54:20,131
He's got a lot of,

4385
01:54:20,131 --> 01:54:21,120
she's got Mac and cheese.

4386
01:54:21,121 --> 01:54:22,310
It's got chicken batter.

4387
01:54:23,050 --> 01:54:23,883
He did have a joke.

4388
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:26,993
Hilarious

4389
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:30,313
chicken.

4390
01:54:32,970 --> 01:54:33,840
Oh my God.

4391
01:54:33,870 --> 01:54:35,340
How many stars does that have?

4392
01:54:35,590 --> 01:54:36,510
Got Five stars,

4393
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:37,633
five stars.

4394
01:54:37,860 --> 01:54:38,191
You know,

4395
01:54:38,191 --> 01:54:40,390
you start feeling good about
yourself in this business thing.

4396
01:54:40,391 --> 01:54:40,700
Can you,

4397
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:41,010
you've,

4398
01:54:41,010 --> 01:54:41,843
you know?

4399
01:54:41,970 --> 01:54:42,151
Yeah.

4400
01:54:42,151 --> 01:54:43,320
This guy's got this guy,

4401
01:54:43,321 --> 01:54:45,720
he's got a private jet because
he was selling Lasagna,

4402
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:46,583
fish batter,

4403
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:47,550
fish batter.

4404
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:48,680
Jesus Christ.

4405
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:51,230
What's crazy is they
think he's like that guy.

4406
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:52,430
It's like,

4407
01:54:52,430 --> 01:54:56,060
you know Andrew dice clay who
I'm a huge fan of when he,

4408
01:54:56,061 --> 01:54:59,990
the dice man was one of his many
characters that he would do,

4409
01:55:00,170 --> 01:55:03,110
but it was so good that he's like
fuck all these other characters.

4410
01:55:03,111 --> 01:55:04,790
I'm just sticking with
the salt dice man thing.

4411
01:55:05,120 --> 01:55:06,730
And then he became the dice man.

4412
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:07,940
Now he's always the dice Matt.

4413
01:55:08,150 --> 01:55:08,391
He's,

4414
01:55:08,391 --> 01:55:12,110
but they've morphed and it's not like
he's pretending to be the dice man.

4415
01:55:12,140 --> 01:55:13,880
That literally is who he is now.

4416
01:55:13,881 --> 01:55:16,850
So when he shows up with
giant sunglasses on that like,

4417
01:55:16,851 --> 01:55:19,700
you know like literally six inches
high and he's got a fanny pack made a

4418
01:55:19,701 --> 01:55:20,031
leather,

4419
01:55:20,031 --> 01:55:20,541
which by the way,

4420
01:55:20,541 --> 01:55:22,910
I've got a great fanny
pack because of him.

4421
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:25,520
The route of people that are
looking for a good fanny pack,

4422
01:55:25,521 --> 01:55:26,330
a solid one.

4423
01:55:26,330 --> 01:55:28,430
The leather roots fanny pack.

4424
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:30,140
That's the one that
Andrew dice clay wares.

4425
01:55:31,990 --> 01:55:32,560
But he's done.

4426
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:36,250
He's a nice man that he sent in
his fanny pack money cause Canada.

4427
01:55:36,910 --> 01:55:37,870
What's that fanny pack line?

4428
01:55:37,871 --> 01:55:38,510
Camp Roots.

4429
01:55:38,510 --> 01:55:39,550
Canadian is a Canadian.

4430
01:55:39,551 --> 01:55:39,880
Yeah.

4431
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:40,061
Well,

4432
01:55:40,061 --> 01:55:44,070
if Americans just had the balls to produce
a quality fanny back and not be those

4433
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:45,900
weird vendors that you know,

4434
01:55:45,901 --> 01:55:47,910
a fun and stuff on Amazon,

4435
01:55:47,911 --> 01:55:48,121
you're like,

4436
01:55:48,121 --> 01:55:48,361
man,

4437
01:55:48,361 --> 01:55:50,150
do I send them my fan?

4438
01:55:50,780 --> 01:55:51,450
He's like,

4439
01:55:51,450 --> 01:55:54,150
what they call the silly vagina.

4440
01:55:54,151 --> 01:55:56,400
They're still driving
in the left hand side.

4441
01:55:56,430 --> 01:55:57,450
They can't be,

4442
01:55:57,530 --> 01:55:58,150
you know,

4443
01:55:58,150 --> 01:56:00,160
you lose all your credibility
when you're trying to

4444
01:56:02,340 --> 01:56:04,380
cars so that you could use a sword.

4445
01:56:04,740 --> 01:56:08,010
I heard that the reason they
do that is because Napoleon,

4446
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:11,040
the conquering armies
getting back to Paris,

4447
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:12,570
they chose the right side.

4448
01:56:12,571 --> 01:56:15,900
So the left side is the
loser side of the road.

4449
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:17,310
I think it's actually,

4450
01:56:17,670 --> 01:56:18,390
I don't know.

4451
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:19,380
That might just be some weird.

4452
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:23,700
Both guys dude told me at a bar that
wouldn't make any sense because then both

4453
01:56:23,701 --> 01:56:26,250
guys be the loser because they're both
on the left depending on which direction

4454
01:56:26,251 --> 01:56:27,084
your head again.

4455
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:28,230
But back to Paris.

4456
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:28,501
Oh,

4457
01:56:28,501 --> 01:56:29,334
back to Paris.

4458
01:56:29,390 --> 01:56:29,790
Um,

4459
01:56:29,790 --> 01:56:30,330
here's the,

4460
01:56:30,330 --> 01:56:31,163
the thing,

4461
01:56:31,290 --> 01:56:34,590
the one that makes sense to me is
that if you're on the left hand side,

4462
01:56:34,591 --> 01:56:35,940
you can defend yourself with your right,

4463
01:56:36,030 --> 01:56:36,810
which is your,

4464
01:56:36,810 --> 01:56:37,650
your strong arm.

4465
01:56:37,650 --> 01:56:40,110
Most people are dominant right handed
and they would be holding the sword.

4466
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:43,320
So that's why they would
pass on the left hand side.

4467
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:46,800
And since these are all like ancient
cultures were talking about like England

4468
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:47,570
and mean,

4469
01:56:47,570 --> 01:56:48,510
they're really ancient.

4470
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:48,751
I mean,

4471
01:56:48,751 --> 01:56:49,620
you think about how long,

4472
01:56:49,650 --> 01:56:49,861
I mean,

4473
01:56:49,861 --> 01:56:52,560
you can go to a bar in
England that's 900 years old.

4474
01:56:52,561 --> 01:56:53,200
I love that.

4475
01:56:53,200 --> 01:56:54,000
It's amazing.

4476
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,650
There's a bar in not numb.

4477
01:56:56,070 --> 01:56:57,360
It's underneath the castle.

4478
01:56:57,361 --> 01:56:58,820
It's on the backside.

4479
01:56:58,880 --> 01:56:59,713
Uh,

4480
01:56:59,730 --> 01:57:03,780
and it's where people would drink
before they went off on to fight in the

4481
01:57:03,781 --> 01:57:04,830
Crusades and shit.

4482
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:05,761
It's amazing.

4483
01:57:05,761 --> 01:57:06,594
It's insane.

4484
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:08,063
My God.

4485
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:08,611
Yeah,

4486
01:57:08,611 --> 01:57:10,230
that kind of like that kind of history.

4487
01:57:10,710 --> 01:57:11,530
It's um,

4488
01:57:11,530 --> 01:57:11,970
you know,

4489
01:57:11,970 --> 01:57:14,220
it makes sense that they still have
that left side of the road thing.

4490
01:57:14,370 --> 01:57:16,220
That's what they did for
fucking hundreds a year.

4491
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:16,801
That makes sense.

4492
01:57:16,801 --> 01:57:17,401
Then you could use,

4493
01:57:17,401 --> 01:57:17,820
you're right.

4494
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:18,610
You're right.

4495
01:57:18,610 --> 01:57:19,110
Yeah.

4496
01:57:19,110 --> 01:57:19,441
Okay.

4497
01:57:19,441 --> 01:57:20,900
Well then I guess that's
the better side of that.

4498
01:57:20,950 --> 01:57:21,930
Like if you're jousting,

4499
01:57:21,990 --> 01:57:22,351
I think,

4500
01:57:22,351 --> 01:57:22,621
you know,

4501
01:57:22,621 --> 01:57:23,454
that's how you do it.

4502
01:57:23,850 --> 01:57:25,260
Only you would think
of something like that.

4503
01:57:25,290 --> 01:57:25,561
No,

4504
01:57:25,561 --> 01:57:27,510
it's not that only I'd so I asked,

4505
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:28,140
you know,

4506
01:57:28,140 --> 01:57:28,311
oh,

4507
01:57:28,311 --> 01:57:29,190
it didn't make any sense.

4508
01:57:29,460 --> 01:57:29,821
I was like,

4509
01:57:29,821 --> 01:57:31,590
this seems like every we American be.

4510
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:33,690
I asked somebody and they told
me that Bullshit Napoleon,

4511
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:34,793
you know,

4512
01:57:35,130 --> 01:57:39,300
well we've made the first cars so it
would make sense that since we decided to

4513
01:57:39,301 --> 01:57:39,931
driving the right,

4514
01:57:39,931 --> 01:57:41,930
everybody would just honor that Dell like,

4515
01:57:41,940 --> 01:57:42,773
yeah,

4516
01:57:42,810 --> 01:57:44,000
not feeling it loud.

4517
01:57:44,240 --> 01:57:46,890
I'm going to put the stint
in wheel on the other side.

4518
01:57:46,891 --> 01:57:50,340
I feel a little more comfortable
like in Sword Swipe out the window.

4519
01:57:51,170 --> 01:57:54,840
So they decided even though they wouldn't
have to import our automobile because

4520
01:57:55,110 --> 01:57:55,411
we're,

4521
01:57:55,411 --> 01:57:57,960
the one's smart enough
to figure it out first.

4522
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,090
They still had to put it on the left side.

4523
01:58:01,470 --> 01:58:01,981
That's you know,

4524
01:58:01,981 --> 01:58:06,150
that's also just not one to bow down to
American dominance and I was wearing,

4525
01:58:06,160 --> 01:58:06,993
boy,

4526
01:58:07,150 --> 01:58:12,150
a lot of them Europeans still got a
lot of shitty idea is a friend of mine,

4527
01:58:13,350 --> 01:58:16,080
this Guy Kevin Healy
who runs the Roshan Dub,

4528
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:19,410
just cool rock club and Galway
Ireland and they do comedy there.

4529
01:58:19,411 --> 01:58:20,041
It sounds amazing.

4530
01:58:20,041 --> 01:58:20,790
Wonderful Dude.

4531
01:58:20,790 --> 01:58:21,391
I Love Golf.

4532
01:58:21,391 --> 01:58:22,224
What's the name again?

4533
01:58:22,370 --> 01:58:23,670
It's called the in dub.

4534
01:58:23,671 --> 01:58:24,391
It's a,

4535
01:58:24,391 --> 01:58:26,940
it's like fucking Celtic for black rose.

4536
01:58:26,970 --> 01:58:27,840
I need to get a tee shirt.

4537
01:58:27,841 --> 01:58:28,740
Can I buy one online?

4538
01:58:28,770 --> 01:58:29,170
But yeah,

4539
01:58:29,170 --> 01:58:29,790
of course.

4540
01:58:29,790 --> 01:58:30,210
Yeah,

4541
01:58:30,210 --> 01:58:30,930
totally.

4542
01:58:30,930 --> 01:58:31,411
So,

4543
01:58:31,411 --> 01:58:31,831
but he's,

4544
01:58:31,831 --> 01:58:33,960
he's funny man and he's
a really funny dude.

4545
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:38,790
And his talking gps in his car
is a British woman's voice.

4546
01:58:39,060 --> 01:58:41,810
And so I was driving around with
him one and then like it was it,

4547
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:42,580
uh,

4548
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:47,130
take the third into the roundabout and
take the third left and then like he'd

4549
01:58:47,140 --> 01:58:47,461
drive it,

4550
01:58:47,461 --> 01:58:48,161
you pass it.

4551
01:58:48,161 --> 01:58:50,890
And they did go a different way
and he'd just look at me and go,

4552
01:58:51,130 --> 01:58:52,210
I need to word that in English,

4553
01:58:52,211 --> 01:58:53,044
but it's still doing,

4554
01:58:55,440 --> 01:59:00,370
Brian had a girl that he was daddy at
one point in time who did not like that

4555
01:59:00,371 --> 01:59:02,560
his navigation system had a girl's voice

4556
01:59:04,230 --> 01:59:07,200
because I would like choose like the
British chick voice cause that I thought

4557
01:59:07,201 --> 01:59:09,610
that was the sexiest one bed it,

4558
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:09,841
you know,

4559
01:59:09,841 --> 01:59:10,500
whatever.

4560
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:11,101
And she was like,

4561
01:59:11,101 --> 01:59:12,330
will you please change this?

4562
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:13,870
Why do we have to listen to her?

4563
01:59:13,871 --> 01:59:15,510
And like every time I
would come in my car,

4564
01:59:15,511 --> 01:59:16,590
she would like have changed.

4565
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:18,410
Jackson's,

4566
01:59:18,410 --> 01:59:20,390
that's what's called a
healthy relationship.

4567
01:59:21,810 --> 01:59:22,643
Oh right.

4568
01:59:23,390 --> 01:59:24,223
Imagine that.

4569
01:59:24,340 --> 01:59:25,820
Try bringing that up to a psychologist.

4570
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:26,150
I,

4571
01:59:26,150 --> 01:59:26,690
you know,

4572
01:59:26,690 --> 01:59:29,390
he tries to make me jealous
with the navigation system.

4573
01:59:31,130 --> 01:59:33,050
It's a girl's voice and
the girls are whore.

4574
01:59:33,830 --> 01:59:34,663
Okay.

4575
01:59:35,170 --> 01:59:35,800
And I remember I,

4576
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:36,371
there was like,

4577
01:59:36,371 --> 01:59:37,091
it was from Tom,

4578
01:59:37,091 --> 01:59:38,650
Tom and I forget who it was.

4579
01:59:38,651 --> 01:59:41,020
There was some kind of
like sexy person that,

4580
01:59:41,021 --> 01:59:41,740
that uh,

4581
01:59:41,740 --> 01:59:43,780
that they ended up
having these voice packs.

4582
01:59:43,781 --> 01:59:47,770
You could buy like Darth Vader
and then it was like a Bob Dylan.

4583
01:59:48,730 --> 01:59:49,060
Right.

4584
01:59:49,060 --> 01:59:50,920
And there was a sexy one
that I bought and it just,

4585
01:59:50,921 --> 01:59:51,030
yeah,

4586
01:59:51,030 --> 01:59:53,250
like blew the lid off or wait a minute.

4587
01:59:54,590 --> 01:59:55,100
Yeah,

4588
01:59:55,100 --> 01:59:55,731
that's how it was.

4589
01:59:55,731 --> 01:59:57,200
Do you want to really make some money?

4590
01:59:57,230 --> 01:59:58,610
Make a plugin with Joey,

4591
01:59:59,540 --> 02:00:01,070
Joey Diaz telling you what a gold,

4592
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:05,080
what the fuck did I just locked up?

4593
02:00:05,081 --> 02:00:06,880
Fuck did I just say left our dog,

4594
02:00:07,620 --> 02:00:08,453
Chile.

4595
02:00:09,970 --> 02:00:12,530
That would be the greatest
navigation system of all time.

4596
02:00:12,531 --> 02:00:13,580
We got to find investors.

4597
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:15,473
No one's done it.

4598
02:00:15,590 --> 02:00:18,380
My friend David Herwoods did
come up with an idea once,

4599
02:00:18,381 --> 02:00:21,680
but it was an idea of Joey
giving advice on the toilet.

4600
02:00:21,681 --> 02:00:22,160
Like little,

4601
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:25,010
little short blurbs had to film it.

4602
02:00:25,250 --> 02:00:25,461
Yeah.

4603
02:00:25,461 --> 02:00:25,910
And he could put,

4604
02:00:25,910 --> 02:00:27,500
they called it a fat man on the toilet,

4605
02:00:27,501 --> 02:00:28,490
which is disrespectful,

4606
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:28,701
you know,

4607
02:00:28,701 --> 02:00:30,650
you've got to coach Joey
Coco Diaz on a toilet.

4608
02:00:30,651 --> 02:00:32,360
That's what you want a fat man.

4609
02:00:32,361 --> 02:00:33,500
It's not just cause he's fat,

4610
02:00:33,570 --> 02:00:34,220
you know,

4611
02:00:34,220 --> 02:00:36,500
that was a little on
the spot and he's tall.

4612
02:00:36,501 --> 02:00:38,090
He's tall man on the toilet,

4613
02:00:38,091 --> 02:00:38,321
you know,

4614
02:00:38,321 --> 02:00:38,511
you know,

4615
02:00:38,511 --> 02:00:39,530
just describe them.

4616
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:40,980
That was a low point in my life,

4617
02:00:40,981 --> 02:00:41,230
Joe,

4618
02:00:41,230 --> 02:00:46,230
being in that small bathroom and summer
day with a Joey Diaz naked right in

4619
02:00:46,681 --> 02:00:46,961
front of me.

4620
02:00:46,961 --> 02:00:49,410
The balls hanging over
the toilet seat somehow.

4621
02:00:49,411 --> 02:00:50,610
I don't even know how that's possible.

4622
02:00:50,970 --> 02:00:51,960
Did you smell him at all?

4623
02:00:52,050 --> 02:00:52,561
Oh yeah.

4624
02:00:52,561 --> 02:00:54,660
It smelled like a big Joey Diaz.

4625
02:00:54,930 --> 02:00:55,260
Like,

4626
02:00:55,260 --> 02:00:56,580
I mean it smelled like balls in there.

4627
02:00:57,260 --> 02:00:57,540
Yeah.

4628
02:00:57,540 --> 02:00:58,500
And then like his wife,

4629
02:00:58,580 --> 02:00:59,413
uh,

4630
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:00,360
the person's house.

4631
02:01:00,361 --> 02:01:00,751
It's what?

4632
02:01:00,751 --> 02:01:04,230
Like the wife would come in with
lemonade and just eliminate anyone,

4633
02:01:04,231 --> 02:01:04,921
like real nice.

4634
02:01:04,921 --> 02:01:05,400
And I'm like,

4635
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:07,230
don't you see his guys balls is right.

4636
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:08,700
Like this is so creepy.

4637
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:10,290
I felt like I was in Cape Horn.

4638
02:01:10,550 --> 02:01:11,310
I thought that was,

4639
02:01:11,310 --> 02:01:14,370
I thought that was a hidden
camera joke on me at the time,

4640
02:01:14,371 --> 02:01:14,820
Joe,

4641
02:01:14,820 --> 02:01:15,391
because I was like,

4642
02:01:15,391 --> 02:01:17,460
how am I in right now

4643
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:18,713
is a joke.

4644
02:01:19,210 --> 02:01:20,070
It was funny.

4645
02:01:20,130 --> 02:01:22,590
I mean it was a Joey's
funny in anything he does,

4646
02:01:22,591 --> 02:01:23,010
man.

4647
02:01:23,010 --> 02:01:24,270
Joey's was always funny.

4648
02:01:24,630 --> 02:01:24,811
Hey,

4649
02:01:24,811 --> 02:01:25,531
did you see this?

4650
02:01:25,531 --> 02:01:27,420
A transgender navy seal?

4651
02:01:27,460 --> 02:01:27,800
Yeah,

4652
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:28,650
count came out.

4653
02:01:29,330 --> 02:01:29,660
Yeah.

4654
02:01:29,660 --> 02:01:33,630
I used to be a dude is barely look in
Evan Tanner looking dude with a big full

4655
02:01:33,631 --> 02:01:35,070
beard and uh,

4656
02:01:35,100 --> 02:01:38,730
got a sex change and
became a woman and uh,

4657
02:01:38,790 --> 02:01:40,160
now calls herself warrior

4658
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:43,460
princess and just like
went for a full sex change.

4659
02:01:43,461 --> 02:01:44,294
I mean she,

4660
02:01:44,450 --> 02:01:45,920
she was at one point in time,

4661
02:01:45,940 --> 02:01:47,570
20 years as a navy seal,

4662
02:01:47,750 --> 02:01:49,820
fought some of the most dangerous
battlefields in the world.

4663
02:01:50,330 --> 02:01:51,260
After she left service,

4664
02:01:51,261 --> 02:01:52,410
she realized she wasn't living in La.

4665
02:01:52,411 --> 02:01:53,240
She wanted,

4666
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:56,900
I decided to become a woman
to go from like that Quito,

4667
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:00,500
a ferocious fighting.

4668
02:02:02,130 --> 02:02:03,350
This is off the sensitivity.

4669
02:02:03,351 --> 02:02:05,420
That's either you got
to applaud that person.

4670
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:06,171
Yeah.

4671
02:02:06,171 --> 02:02:07,880
If that's what you want to do for sure.

4672
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:08,840
It's uh,

4673
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:09,141
you know,

4674
02:02:09,141 --> 02:02:09,860
and um,

4675
02:02:09,860 --> 02:02:12,380
I put it online and like some people like,

4676
02:02:12,381 --> 02:02:13,214
um,

4677
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:14,330
um,

4678
02:02:14,330 --> 02:02:16,220
still think there was,

4679
02:02:16,221 --> 02:02:18,500
there's an issue with a
transgender MMA fighter.

4680
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:19,010
Uh,

4681
02:02:19,010 --> 02:02:22,940
there was a man who became a woman and
then started fighting as a woman and MMA

4682
02:02:22,941 --> 02:02:25,280
fights and like just brutally
knocking these women out.

4683
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:25,911
Do you remember that?

4684
02:02:25,911 --> 02:02:26,381
That in,

4685
02:02:26,381 --> 02:02:26,871
in a,

4686
02:02:26,871 --> 02:02:29,000
in the Thai boxing and then in the 90s,

4687
02:02:29,001 --> 02:02:29,810
that was the opposite.

4688
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:33,050
There was a guy and then with
his monies cause winnings,

4689
02:02:33,051 --> 02:02:35,510
he got the operations
further as he went along.

4690
02:02:35,511 --> 02:02:37,550
So he was really good and bad,

4691
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:38,361
a sex change.

4692
02:02:38,361 --> 02:02:40,010
And then he didn't have
any testosterone anymore.

4693
02:02:40,011 --> 02:02:41,840
He started getting
beaten up by girls can't,

4694
02:02:44,330 --> 02:02:47,330
well this a transgender you formerly male,

4695
02:02:47,331 --> 02:02:50,390
a woman can and she's
knocked out three girls.

4696
02:02:50,391 --> 02:02:52,190
Then she choked out
another girl that recently.

4697
02:02:52,610 --> 02:02:53,331
But there's,

4698
02:02:53,331 --> 02:02:57,740
there's certain mechanical advantages
to the human body when it's man,

4699
02:02:57,741 --> 02:02:59,540
when it's born with a y chromosome.

4700
02:02:59,570 --> 02:03:03,140
The testosterone were 30 years of
his life before he became a woman.

4701
02:03:03,620 --> 02:03:05,090
And I think that like there's,

4702
02:03:05,120 --> 02:03:06,320
that's undeniable.

4703
02:03:06,350 --> 02:03:08,870
There's also an advantage
in reaction time,

4704
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:09,590
like what?

4705
02:03:09,590 --> 02:03:13,940
It's 10% across the board advantage
and reaction time for men over women.

4706
02:03:13,970 --> 02:03:15,740
And like several tests.

4707
02:03:15,950 --> 02:03:20,090
It's not like a one time thing where
they got a bunch of slow checks.

4708
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:21,420
Like there's something about the,

4709
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:26,560
the just the male constitution that
makes it more better adapted to certain

4710
02:03:27,141 --> 02:03:28,040
physical things.

4711
02:03:28,041 --> 02:03:29,120
And fighting is one of them.

4712
02:03:29,570 --> 02:03:31,140
And there's some people be,

4713
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:33,200
it became like this gender issue.

4714
02:03:33,350 --> 02:03:34,880
And one of the things I found out this is,

4715
02:03:34,881 --> 02:03:35,960
it's really fascinating.

4716
02:03:35,961 --> 02:03:40,220
There's a rift in the feminist community
and there's feminists that hate

4717
02:03:40,221 --> 02:03:44,720
transgenders or should I say don't
approve of transgenders being considered a

4718
02:03:44,721 --> 02:03:45,350
woman.

4719
02:03:45,350 --> 02:03:46,670
They think a woman is a woman.

4720
02:03:46,850 --> 02:03:49,970
And when a man starts off life as a man,

4721
02:03:49,971 --> 02:03:50,870
he stays a man.

4722
02:03:50,871 --> 02:03:51,704
And you know the thing,

4723
02:03:51,850 --> 02:03:52,940
the idea that that woman,

4724
02:03:52,970 --> 02:03:57,920
that man is now a woman and can compete
with women in athletics is ridiculous.

4725
02:03:58,190 --> 02:04:01,640
And so one of the things they site is
this MMA thing where this check is like

4726
02:04:01,670 --> 02:04:01,911
I'm seeing,

4727
02:04:01,911 --> 02:04:02,930
I'm not particularly talented,

4728
02:04:02,931 --> 02:04:06,980
but she's just a man like bitches
need him in the face and knocking them

4729
02:04:06,981 --> 02:04:10,250
unconscious and putting them on the ground
and putting her her knee on people's

4730
02:04:10,251 --> 02:04:11,720
necks and choking them out quick.

4731
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:14,660
And it's like she's not fighting like
the elite of the elite competition.

4732
02:04:14,661 --> 02:04:19,280
But the way she's winning
is quite convincing and that
sort of stirs the debate

4733
02:04:19,281 --> 02:04:19,940
up.

4734
02:04:19,940 --> 02:04:22,370
But I've never been in any way,

4735
02:04:22,371 --> 02:04:26,210
shape or form against anyone
who wants to be a transgender.

4736
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:29,300
My position is only as
a martial arts expert.

4737
02:04:29,570 --> 02:04:33,890
I've been doing martial arts since I
was a child and I know that there are

4738
02:04:33,891 --> 02:04:37,530
certain things that make
someone physically more
dangerous and one of them is

4739
02:04:37,531 --> 02:04:38,520
bone structure.

4740
02:04:38,521 --> 02:04:41,880
It doesn't change when you
have big giant man hands,

4741
02:04:41,910 --> 02:04:45,570
big giant man hands of dangerous
as fuck and little tiny hands.

4742
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:46,860
No matter how good you get it,

4743
02:04:46,861 --> 02:04:47,694
hitting things,

4744
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:48,990
they never really that dangerous.

4745
02:04:49,170 --> 02:04:51,690
A little tiny hands break in
your face like a woman's hand.

4746
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:52,110
They're not.

4747
02:04:52,110 --> 02:04:53,580
They're not built for punching shit.

4748
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:56,070
You gotta wrap 'em up
good and put them in pads.

4749
02:04:56,070 --> 02:04:57,750
Otherwise I'd just
shatter on your forehead.

4750
02:04:58,230 --> 02:05:00,630
There's a lot of things
to to to being a man,

4751
02:05:00,631 --> 02:05:01,980
like the way the hips are built.

4752
02:05:02,010 --> 02:05:02,221
They,

4753
02:05:02,221 --> 02:05:04,740
there's a mechanical advantage
to using the hips that way,

4754
02:05:05,430 --> 02:05:08,940
but that doesn't mean I'm
against people being transgender.

4755
02:05:08,941 --> 02:05:12,030
I think you should be able to do whatever
the fuck you want and I think that

4756
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:16,350
there's going to be a lot of people when
they do some sort of a chromosome will

4757
02:05:16,351 --> 02:05:17,140
switch when they,

4758
02:05:17,140 --> 02:05:20,970
they really get into high level genetic
manipulation and they literally can turn

4759
02:05:20,971 --> 02:05:21,804
you into a woman.

4760
02:05:21,990 --> 02:05:26,070
I think every man should be forced to be
a woman for at least a couple of months

4761
02:05:26,071 --> 02:05:29,190
of his life just so you could feel
what it feels like to be vulnerable.

4762
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:31,620
It feels that it feels like
to be Douche on by guys.

4763
02:05:31,621 --> 02:05:32,790
I mean maybe if like,

4764
02:05:32,791 --> 02:05:35,360
you know how you have to like you,

4765
02:05:35,390 --> 02:05:38,040
you live in Israel and you have to
like do like a couple of years in the

4766
02:05:38,041 --> 02:05:38,874
service.

4767
02:05:38,940 --> 02:05:43,680
I think every man should have to be forced
to live a couple of years as a woman.

4768
02:05:43,860 --> 02:05:45,180
Really as a real woman,

4769
02:05:45,210 --> 02:05:45,690
like,

4770
02:05:45,690 --> 02:05:45,950
Yo,

4771
02:05:45,950 --> 02:05:47,100
you're a 250 pound man.

4772
02:05:47,490 --> 02:05:47,941
No,

4773
02:05:47,941 --> 02:05:51,660
you're a 90 pound Chinese girl now and
this is how you gotta live your life for

4774
02:05:51,661 --> 02:05:52,800
the next two years,

4775
02:05:52,860 --> 02:05:54,510
two years as a woman.

4776
02:05:54,511 --> 02:05:56,250
So you have like real empathy,

4777
02:05:56,400 --> 02:06:01,110
but it feels like to be overpowered or
threatened by the opposite sex or the

4778
02:06:01,111 --> 02:06:05,820
people who were like sexually attracted
to you also being the most likely ones

4779
02:06:05,821 --> 02:06:06,720
to take your life.

4780
02:06:07,860 --> 02:06:08,693
You know,

4781
02:06:08,730 --> 02:06:09,840
I think when that happens,

4782
02:06:09,870 --> 02:06:11,670
it would be a very strange
world when you can just say,

4783
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:12,331
Tom,

4784
02:06:12,331 --> 02:06:13,140
what do you this week?

4785
02:06:13,140 --> 02:06:13,531
Oh Dude,

4786
02:06:13,531 --> 02:06:14,390
I'm a black guy.

4787
02:06:14,690 --> 02:06:15,523
And

4788
02:06:17,120 --> 02:06:18,080
Oh my God,

4789
02:06:18,200 --> 02:06:21,620
Brian would be girls put together
a funk band immediately if you get,

4790
02:06:21,630 --> 02:06:22,550
if Brian can be anything

4791
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:25,353
super woman,

4792
02:06:25,670 --> 02:06:26,960
super woman or wonder woman,

4793
02:06:26,961 --> 02:06:29,180
super woman wonder woman
had more cool shit though.

4794
02:06:29,181 --> 02:06:30,500
She had a chat and she had,

4795
02:06:30,590 --> 02:06:32,390
but I guess superwoman
can fly in her own right,

4796
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:34,400
cool,

4797
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:35,690
cool places and masturbate.

4798
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:37,610
But yet she never achieved the fame.

4799
02:06:37,910 --> 02:06:38,900
That wonder woman had.

4800
02:06:39,150 --> 02:06:42,200
It's like what separates Whitney
Cummings from Eliza swessinger?

4801
02:06:42,470 --> 02:06:45,080
What is it that makes Whitney
Cummings so much more successful?

4802
02:06:45,320 --> 02:06:47,150
That's like wonder woman over superwoman.

4803
02:06:47,420 --> 02:06:49,460
I mean maybe Supergirl or
whatever the fuck she was.

4804
02:06:49,461 --> 02:06:50,780
Maybe she was really bad ass,

4805
02:06:50,900 --> 02:06:52,550
but she never got nearly the props.

4806
02:06:52,551 --> 02:06:55,420
That wonder what my guy
wonder woman with her jet.

4807
02:06:56,490 --> 02:06:59,150
Do you remember the Dave Chappelle joke
he used to do about that she had an

4808
02:06:59,151 --> 02:06:59,984
invisible jet?

4809
02:07:01,070 --> 02:07:01,270
No.

4810
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:01,941
What did he say?

4811
02:07:01,941 --> 02:07:03,020
What's that prostitute?

4812
02:07:05,590 --> 02:07:06,590
They look like

4813
02:07:09,060 --> 02:07:11,240
the most ridiculous outfit.

4814
02:07:11,450 --> 02:07:11,991
If you could be,

4815
02:07:11,991 --> 02:07:16,040
if I could be any superhero
know if between super woman
or why do I say I would

4816
02:07:16,041 --> 02:07:16,751
rather that Carter,

4817
02:07:16,751 --> 02:07:17,670
I remember Linda Carter,

4818
02:07:17,671 --> 02:07:19,040
super woman was blonde hair,

4819
02:07:19,041 --> 02:07:21,620
so she wouldn't have to
shave as much like her legs,

4820
02:07:21,650 --> 02:07:22,250
like you know,

4821
02:07:22,250 --> 02:07:22,880
Brown hair,

4822
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:23,960
you'd have to shave more.

4823
02:07:23,990 --> 02:07:27,380
So I think it was less mace
maintenance to be superwoman.

4824
02:07:27,650 --> 02:07:28,520
I think you're right.

4825
02:07:28,580 --> 02:07:31,310
And I think that wonder woman
can't even fly on her own.

4826
02:07:31,311 --> 02:07:33,440
She needs a plan and that just stupid.

4827
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:36,560
Plus she's got her magic
of truth and she's right.

4828
02:07:36,561 --> 02:07:37,810
And then the bullet proof,

4829
02:07:37,811 --> 02:07:39,450
a wrist band.

4830
02:07:39,500 --> 02:07:41,800
Since she's fucking Ka Ching Ching.

4831
02:07:41,940 --> 02:07:45,310
And you can move that fast to hit
bullets with your wrists please.

4832
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:49,120
I can't remember like captain slow all
the other times he didn't fly either.

4833
02:07:49,121 --> 02:07:49,261
Yeah.

4834
02:07:49,261 --> 02:07:50,110
Like yeah,

4835
02:07:50,111 --> 02:07:50,944
he was,

4836
02:07:51,060 --> 02:07:52,370
he just had a sword.

4837
02:07:53,270 --> 02:07:56,470
Well Captain America was
like the ultimate roid man.

4838
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:58,630
Like they created him with like a roid.

4839
02:07:58,660 --> 02:08:00,000
It's like a Super Roy,

4840
02:08:00,020 --> 02:08:00,853
like they shot off,

4841
02:08:00,870 --> 02:08:02,290
he's a little skinny guy in the movie.

4842
02:08:02,340 --> 02:08:04,000
Is the movie the same as the comic book?

4843
02:08:04,030 --> 02:08:05,540
I never even bothered to watch that piece.

4844
02:08:05,541 --> 02:08:08,740
It wasn't really a captain [inaudible]
even though it was a marvel comic.

4845
02:08:08,770 --> 02:08:10,240
I mean that was in my wheelhouse,

4846
02:08:10,270 --> 02:08:12,100
but I was never really
a captain America guy.

4847
02:08:12,130 --> 02:08:13,020
But the movie's not bad.

4848
02:08:13,070 --> 02:08:18,070
Well I remember Captain America and I
know when I was a kid in the 70s eighties

4849
02:08:18,831 --> 02:08:19,664
looking through,

4850
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:22,670
he would be getting his ass
beat and then his black friend,

4851
02:08:22,671 --> 02:08:24,290
the Falcon would show up.

4852
02:08:24,910 --> 02:08:25,743
It was always

4853
02:08:27,050 --> 02:08:30,020
captain America is getting his ass beat
and then his black friend and it was

4854
02:08:30,021 --> 02:08:30,410
like,

4855
02:08:30,410 --> 02:08:30,621
you know,

4856
02:08:30,621 --> 02:08:31,910
like the mid seventies where like,

4857
02:08:32,090 --> 02:08:32,331
you know,

4858
02:08:32,331 --> 02:08:35,060
they're trying to like integrate
like a black superhero,

4859
02:08:35,061 --> 02:08:37,160
but they didn't want to
give him his own magazine.

4860
02:08:37,610 --> 02:08:41,540
So then the Falcon would come in and
save the day and kick everybody's ass.

4861
02:08:42,600 --> 02:08:45,720
You don't remember the time I do now
that you brought it up or I remember very

4862
02:08:45,721 --> 02:08:46,554
much.

4863
02:08:46,620 --> 02:08:47,453
That's hilarious.

4864
02:08:47,460 --> 02:08:47,851
So,

4865
02:08:47,851 --> 02:08:48,560
uh,

4866
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:49,650
dude who played them?

4867
02:08:49,910 --> 02:08:50,743
Um,

4868
02:08:50,770 --> 02:08:51,380
uh,

4869
02:08:51,380 --> 02:08:51,580
did,

4870
02:08:51,580 --> 02:08:53,950
they didn't have the falcon the
do to play to captain America.

4871
02:08:53,951 --> 02:08:54,784
It was perfect.

4872
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:56,040
Did you see the Avengers?

4873
02:08:56,041 --> 02:08:56,874
That dude,

4874
02:08:57,220 --> 02:08:58,260
it looks like Captain America.

4875
02:08:58,261 --> 02:08:59,094
He's the perfect guy.

4876
02:08:59,430 --> 02:09:00,180
He's perfect.

4877
02:09:00,180 --> 02:09:01,410
I just don't like the character at all,

4878
02:09:01,411 --> 02:09:02,430
so I don't even bother,

4879
02:09:02,820 --> 02:09:03,150
you know,

4880
02:09:03,150 --> 02:09:04,200
the movie is pretty good dude.

4881
02:09:04,350 --> 02:09:05,183
Give it a shot.

4882
02:09:05,690 --> 02:09:06,270
I seen the first,

4883
02:09:06,270 --> 02:09:06,371
no,

4884
02:09:06,371 --> 02:09:06,460
no,

4885
02:09:06,460 --> 02:09:06,580
no.

4886
02:09:06,580 --> 02:09:07,500
There's captain America.

4887
02:09:08,220 --> 02:09:10,260
Really Captain America.

4888
02:09:10,350 --> 02:09:12,880
Why is it just because you hate
patriotism and you hate America?

4889
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:15,600
I think that's it.

4890
02:09:15,630 --> 02:09:15,781
No.

4891
02:09:15,781 --> 02:09:16,550
Is it really,

4892
02:09:16,550 --> 02:09:18,290
you hate like Rah Rah old,

4893
02:09:18,310 --> 02:09:18,901
the old,

4894
02:09:18,901 --> 02:09:21,420
the old captain America
with his little flags.

4895
02:09:21,421 --> 02:09:21,991
And stuff like that.

4896
02:09:21,991 --> 02:09:22,201
I was,

4897
02:09:22,201 --> 02:09:22,470
I was like,

4898
02:09:22,470 --> 02:09:23,303
get outta here.

4899
02:09:25,290 --> 02:09:26,790
Built such a nice success off.

4900
02:09:26,860 --> 02:09:27,170
Nah,

4901
02:09:27,170 --> 02:09:28,200
I don't hate the country.

4902
02:09:28,201 --> 02:09:29,034
I did just,

4903
02:09:29,100 --> 02:09:30,750
his costume was dumb.

4904
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:31,593
Has

4905
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:34,710
I know what you're talking about.

4906
02:09:34,770 --> 02:09:35,750
You don't want it,

4907
02:09:35,751 --> 02:09:36,031
you know,

4908
02:09:36,031 --> 02:09:36,861
this is the rob,

4909
02:09:36,861 --> 02:09:37,101
rob,

4910
02:09:37,101 --> 02:09:37,950
rob bullshit.

4911
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:38,220
Well,

4912
02:09:38,220 --> 02:09:38,630
you know,

4913
02:09:38,630 --> 02:09:43,630
just giving him some better superpowers
when they conceived that he was crazy

4914
02:09:43,780 --> 02:09:44,231
though.

4915
02:09:44,231 --> 02:09:46,750
When in the fifties during world or two

4916
02:09:46,750 --> 02:09:49,160
or are we supposed to be
fighting against the Nazis?

4917
02:09:49,161 --> 02:09:52,580
Like it's okay to be like Super Patriot
guy when you're fighting against a

4918
02:09:52,581 --> 02:09:53,930
legitimate evil army.

4919
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:54,570
You know?

4920
02:09:54,570 --> 02:09:54,711
I mean,

4921
02:09:54,711 --> 02:09:56,420
that was like a legitimate evil army.

4922
02:09:56,690 --> 02:09:59,840
But then once the United States
army becomes legitimately evil,

4923
02:09:59,870 --> 02:10:03,470
then captain America becomes a goofy
character and that that's the problem.

4924
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:04,100
It's like,

4925
02:10:04,100 --> 02:10:05,480
it's really hard to,

4926
02:10:05,900 --> 02:10:08,540
when you look at foreign
policy and drone attacks,

4927
02:10:08,541 --> 02:10:11,780
and it's really hard to think that those
fucking people that are pulling off

4928
02:10:11,781 --> 02:10:12,531
what they're pulling off,

4929
02:10:12,531 --> 02:10:13,550
wherever the fuck we are,

4930
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:14,241
you know,

4931
02:10:14,241 --> 02:10:17,900
whether it's the invasion of Iraq or
any of the crazy shit they're doing,

4932
02:10:18,200 --> 02:10:20,210
they have fact that the
idea that a noble man,

4933
02:10:20,211 --> 02:10:24,110
like Captain America would be
rushing to very to save the day,

4934
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:28,250
making sure the rest of the world
has oil for centuries to come.

4935
02:10:31,370 --> 02:10:32,510
Just dodging bullets.

4936
02:10:32,580 --> 02:10:33,860
Flying a kickass.

4937
02:10:35,390 --> 02:10:35,900
Yeah.

4938
02:10:35,900 --> 02:10:36,590
Not the best one.

4939
02:10:36,590 --> 02:10:37,220
He's not the best.

4940
02:10:37,220 --> 02:10:37,581
The hawks,

4941
02:10:37,581 --> 02:10:37,911
the bass,

4942
02:10:37,911 --> 02:10:38,290
clearly

4943
02:10:38,290 --> 02:10:38,770
like they do.

4944
02:10:38,770 --> 02:10:39,780
It's a lot of comics.

4945
02:10:39,810 --> 02:10:41,230
I tried to get into like daredevil.

4946
02:10:41,260 --> 02:10:43,090
I tried so hard to get in the dairy that,

4947
02:10:43,120 --> 02:10:44,470
but having a blind guy,

4948
02:10:44,471 --> 02:10:46,860
just not that sexy and that's all yours.

4949
02:10:47,340 --> 02:10:49,720
You're just blind to because
he's blind and you look to move.

4950
02:10:49,721 --> 02:10:50,430
Good.

4951
02:10:50,430 --> 02:10:52,020
Had over like better sense.

4952
02:10:52,070 --> 02:10:52,401
Come on.

4953
02:10:52,401 --> 02:10:52,930
So there shit,

4954
02:10:52,930 --> 02:10:56,230
I don't know and I can't remember any
more than that to get me to buy a fucking

4955
02:10:56,231 --> 02:10:56,771
comic book.

4956
02:10:56,771 --> 02:10:57,250
God dammit.

4957
02:10:57,250 --> 02:10:58,500
Silver surfer is the wall.

4958
02:10:58,570 --> 02:10:59,231
The biggest one.

4959
02:10:59,231 --> 02:11:01,240
I always wanted to like love.

4960
02:11:02,260 --> 02:11:04,450
It never really did it for
me like I tried so much,

4961
02:11:04,630 --> 02:11:07,420
but that's such a cool idea
for a superhero like I got,

4962
02:11:08,150 --> 02:11:08,550
I didn't get,

4963
02:11:08,550 --> 02:11:08,810
I try,

4964
02:11:08,810 --> 02:11:10,950
I mean I bought them and
I just never got into it.

4965
02:11:12,100 --> 02:11:12,400
Why?

4966
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:14,110
Your man was really hard for like,

4967
02:11:14,111 --> 02:11:15,430
I thought the stories were great.

4968
02:11:15,431 --> 02:11:17,650
All that Spiderman's Peter Parker web,

4969
02:11:17,890 --> 02:11:19,000
all the geos.

4970
02:11:19,070 --> 02:11:20,800
You mean the movie silver surfer,

4971
02:11:21,010 --> 02:11:22,270
but did you buy the common notes?

4972
02:11:22,290 --> 02:11:22,841
Comic books?

4973
02:11:22,841 --> 02:11:23,674
I'm talking about common core.

4974
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:24,640
I feel the same way.

4975
02:11:24,670 --> 02:11:26,650
Like when I got silver surfer comic books,

4976
02:11:26,770 --> 02:11:27,400
I would be like,

4977
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:27,611
Ooh,

4978
02:11:27,611 --> 02:11:28,680
a new silver surfers out,

4979
02:11:28,681 --> 02:11:29,910
check it out and then I'd be like Yam,

4980
02:11:29,950 --> 02:11:30,783
blah blah.

4981
02:11:32,080 --> 02:11:34,750
Whereas like Spiderman was always legit.

4982
02:11:34,780 --> 02:11:35,020
Yeah.

4983
02:11:35,020 --> 02:11:39,240
Spiderman always had x
men always best storylines

4984
02:11:39,350 --> 02:11:40,160
ever.

4985
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:42,650
I mean they had some epic
storylines with Phoenix,

4986
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:44,240
you know what I mean?

4987
02:11:44,241 --> 02:11:44,591
That was a,

4988
02:11:44,591 --> 02:11:45,410
that was a great,

4989
02:11:45,410 --> 02:11:46,850
great comic book era.

4990
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:47,181
That was,

4991
02:11:47,181 --> 02:11:48,320
that was the real shit man,

4992
02:11:48,890 --> 02:11:49,540
you know,

4993
02:11:49,540 --> 02:11:50,630
to Dorks,

4994
02:11:50,990 --> 02:11:51,920
Dorks,

4995
02:11:52,010 --> 02:11:52,940
how many people listening,

4996
02:11:52,941 --> 02:11:53,240
right?

4997
02:11:53,240 --> 02:11:54,590
Like dorks.

4998
02:11:54,830 --> 02:11:57,200
That was one of the saddest things I
had to do when I was starving to death.

4999
02:11:57,630 --> 02:12:00,380
I was telling my comic book
collection needed the money,

5000
02:12:00,381 --> 02:12:00,770
man.

5001
02:12:00,770 --> 02:12:04,970
I had nothing and that's all I had left
some comic books that I accumulated

5002
02:12:04,971 --> 02:12:05,470
over,

5003
02:12:05,470 --> 02:12:06,303
you know,

5004
02:12:06,500 --> 02:12:09,620
10 years of life out there in the world.

5005
02:12:09,800 --> 02:12:12,920
I've been read downloading a lot
lately on using like the Marvel App.

5006
02:12:12,950 --> 02:12:13,880
You can just sit there and be like,

5007
02:12:13,881 --> 02:12:15,820
I want every episode of Hawk.

5008
02:12:16,010 --> 02:12:16,370
Oh you don't?

5009
02:12:16,370 --> 02:12:16,990
Okay.

5010
02:12:16,990 --> 02:12:19,570
Comic books like physical
comic books are bad ass,

5011
02:12:19,810 --> 02:12:22,180
but the best experience is on an iPad.

5012
02:12:22,370 --> 02:12:25,090
Get that marvel app on the IPAD
and they go frame to frame.

5013
02:12:25,160 --> 02:12:25,993
Yup.

5014
02:12:26,020 --> 02:12:30,910
Then you don't see what's next and then
you know like you never see a comic book

5015
02:12:30,911 --> 02:12:31,631
where you see,

5016
02:12:31,631 --> 02:12:32,050
you know,

5017
02:12:32,050 --> 02:12:34,180
you always see every page and
you see it right in front of you.

5018
02:12:34,360 --> 02:12:35,440
As you're changing the page,

5019
02:12:35,441 --> 02:12:37,330
you see the left page to the right page,

5020
02:12:37,350 --> 02:12:39,070
see what's coming with these apps.

5021
02:12:39,071 --> 02:12:40,570
He just goes and goes frame to the frame

5022
02:12:40,710 --> 02:12:41,920
and assumes that in real quick,

5023
02:12:41,921 --> 02:12:42,760
kind of like a movie.

5024
02:12:42,820 --> 02:12:45,910
Did you ever think that you'd be like
pushing fucking 40 and still talking about

5025
02:12:45,911 --> 02:12:46,660
comic books?

5026
02:12:46,660 --> 02:12:47,493
Yeah.

5027
02:12:48,530 --> 02:12:51,940
You never appeared anticipated
a period of a golfing,

5028
02:12:52,100 --> 02:12:52,940
no joke.

5029
02:12:53,130 --> 02:12:54,380
I posted a uh,

5030
02:12:54,420 --> 02:12:55,740
a test the other day.

5031
02:12:55,741 --> 02:12:57,030
I don't know if you saw this,

5032
02:12:57,031 --> 02:12:59,940
this is a friend of mine told me to take
it and it's something that I guess a

5033
02:12:59,941 --> 02:13:03,030
lot of people take in college and I,

5034
02:13:03,031 --> 02:13:07,260
it's like 50 questions and I
ended up taking it and wow.

5035
02:13:07,261 --> 02:13:08,010
How crazy.

5036
02:13:08,010 --> 02:13:09,150
Like horoscope wise,

5037
02:13:09,180 --> 02:13:12,030
like how crazy accurate it is.

5038
02:13:12,080 --> 02:13:12,610
And,

5039
02:13:12,610 --> 02:13:14,700
and if you just read a what,

5040
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:16,153
see what it's called,

5041
02:13:16,170 --> 02:13:17,340
if I can find it real quick,

5042
02:13:17,730 --> 02:13:18,510
um,

5043
02:13:18,510 --> 02:13:18,841
if you,

5044
02:13:18,841 --> 02:13:19,441
if you do it,

5045
02:13:19,441 --> 02:13:20,940
I'm really wondering what it is,

5046
02:13:20,941 --> 02:13:22,650
but I asked what everybody

5047
02:13:24,150 --> 02:13:26,490
else was and they were all the same.

5048
02:13:26,700 --> 02:13:28,470
Like they almost every
single person wrote back.

5049
02:13:28,470 --> 02:13:29,221
Like I took the test,

5050
02:13:29,221 --> 02:13:30,540
I am a I n t,

5051
02:13:30,541 --> 02:13:30,811
s,

5052
02:13:30,811 --> 02:13:31,140
p,

5053
02:13:31,140 --> 02:13:31,973
whatever it was.

5054
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:36,780
And that's like the smallest percentage
of people in the world is this group of

5055
02:13:36,781 --> 02:13:39,030
people that all are
following me on Twitter.

5056
02:13:39,031 --> 02:13:40,650
So it was really weird.

5057
02:13:40,770 --> 02:13:42,030
Here's the test that you can go to.

5058
02:13:42,180 --> 02:13:42,811
What is the,

5059
02:13:42,811 --> 02:13:43,051
um,

5060
02:13:43,051 --> 02:13:45,630
the distinguishing factor that makes
them like a really small group?

5061
02:13:45,660 --> 02:13:46,141
I don't know.

5062
02:13:46,141 --> 02:13:46,974
It's just like,

5063
02:13:47,080 --> 02:13:47,913
you see good.

5064
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:53,120
I'm e s F P and I guess the test is
based on some kind of old school.

5065
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:54,870
Well,

5066
02:13:54,870 --> 02:13:55,740
let me try to find it.

5067
02:13:56,280 --> 02:13:59,550
It's called the Junge elaborate
way for you to plug your Twitter,

5068
02:14:00,010 --> 02:14:01,920
the typology tests.

5069
02:14:01,921 --> 02:14:03,320
Did you ever take Carl Young?

5070
02:14:03,650 --> 02:14:04,483
Carl Young.

5071
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:08,640
And so I took this and you can go to
like human metrics.com and it's around

5072
02:14:08,641 --> 02:14:09,030
there,

5073
02:14:09,030 --> 02:14:13,230
but I took this test and just look
at this like description of me.

5074
02:14:13,320 --> 02:14:13,680
Uh,

5075
02:14:13,680 --> 02:14:15,190
it's uh,

5076
02:14:15,230 --> 02:14:16,740
extroverted sensing.

5077
02:14:16,741 --> 02:14:20,190
What does it say was extroverted sensing,

5078
02:14:20,191 --> 02:14:21,480
feeling perceiving.

5079
02:14:21,810 --> 02:14:23,460
And see what it does is it tells you like,

5080
02:14:23,461 --> 02:14:25,200
here's all the different
ones that you can be.

5081
02:14:25,530 --> 02:14:26,700
And it tells you go down,

5082
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:27,593
uh,

5083
02:14:27,970 --> 02:14:28,290
uh,

5084
02:14:28,290 --> 02:14:31,080
like SFPs love to talk
to people about people.

5085
02:14:31,081 --> 02:14:33,890
Some of the most colorful of
story tellers are ESF piece.

5086
02:14:33,891 --> 02:14:34,140
Like,

5087
02:14:34,140 --> 02:14:37,680
like you go through this thing and
then you can even get more accurate.

5088
02:14:37,681 --> 02:14:40,410
And they have like these
horoscopes that are really like,

5089
02:14:40,411 --> 02:14:40,801
Whoa,

5090
02:14:40,801 --> 02:14:42,090
that's intense.

5091
02:14:42,091 --> 02:14:42,924
That's a fascinating,

5092
02:14:43,110 --> 02:14:45,750
you know what the problem with these
things as though the problem with these

5093
02:14:45,751 --> 02:14:46,590
tests is that you know,

5094
02:14:46,591 --> 02:14:47,550
you're taking a test.

5095
02:14:47,700 --> 02:14:48,480
Yeah.

5096
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:48,551
Oh,

5097
02:14:48,551 --> 02:14:49,201
here's another thing.

5098
02:14:49,201 --> 02:14:51,390
That famous Esu would
give them the answer,

5099
02:14:51,391 --> 02:14:52,920
the simulation theory.

5100
02:14:53,420 --> 02:14:53,851
Bob Hope.

5101
02:14:53,851 --> 02:14:54,451
Bob Hope.

5102
02:14:54,451 --> 02:14:55,284
That's hilarious.

5103
02:14:55,380 --> 02:14:55,591
Well,

5104
02:14:55,591 --> 02:14:56,130
it's just,

5105
02:14:56,130 --> 02:14:57,530
you know what it is you,

5106
02:14:57,531 --> 02:14:57,931
you,

5107
02:14:57,931 --> 02:14:59,340
when you know you're taking a test,

5108
02:14:59,370 --> 02:15:03,630
you might not necessarily reveal the
way you would respond to something,

5109
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:04,350
uh,

5110
02:15:04,350 --> 02:15:07,110
a regular basis had you
not been measuring it.

5111
02:15:07,460 --> 02:15:10,500
But the questions are
pretty basic questions.

5112
02:15:10,501 --> 02:15:11,350
Like if you go like,

5113
02:15:11,430 --> 02:15:15,090
like you know how to put every
minute of your time to good purpose.

5114
02:15:15,120 --> 02:15:15,510
No,

5115
02:15:15,510 --> 02:15:16,710
I definitely did not know how to do that.

5116
02:15:16,830 --> 02:15:17,101
You know,

5117
02:15:17,101 --> 02:15:17,461
so it's,

5118
02:15:17,461 --> 02:15:18,140
you know,

5119
02:15:18,140 --> 02:15:21,360
or you're a person somewhat reserved
and distance and communication,

5120
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:22,470
I would say.

5121
02:15:22,770 --> 02:15:23,161
Yeah.

5122
02:15:23,161 --> 02:15:24,020
Besides podcasts,

5123
02:15:24,030 --> 02:15:24,241
you know,

5124
02:15:24,241 --> 02:15:24,541
it's just,

5125
02:15:24,541 --> 02:15:25,320
you know,

5126
02:15:25,320 --> 02:15:26,011
yes and no.

5127
02:15:26,011 --> 02:15:26,431
It's not.

5128
02:15:26,431 --> 02:15:28,920
The actions are frequently
influenced by emotions.

5129
02:15:28,980 --> 02:15:29,401
Yes,

5130
02:15:29,401 --> 02:15:29,960
definitely.

5131
02:15:29,960 --> 02:15:31,650
You usually plan your actions and events.

5132
02:15:32,900 --> 02:15:34,560
Those are things that you could decide.

5133
02:15:34,561 --> 02:15:37,290
What's your thinking with a group
of people attending parties shot.

5134
02:15:37,320 --> 02:15:38,153
Yes.

5135
02:15:38,190 --> 02:15:38,941
You could decide.

5136
02:15:38,941 --> 02:15:41,220
They seem pretty like nonjudgmental,

5137
02:15:41,370 --> 02:15:42,480
which is I think important.

5138
02:15:42,481 --> 02:15:45,540
If you're going to really have something
like that and have it be accurate.

5139
02:15:45,750 --> 02:15:49,260
But I would imagine that would be very
hard to like get a sense of someone's

5140
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:50,940
personality like that.

5141
02:15:51,900 --> 02:15:52,501
Try it out.

5142
02:15:52,501 --> 02:15:54,270
I would really try to stay cause I,

5143
02:15:54,271 --> 02:15:55,560
I've read it and it blew my mind.

5144
02:15:55,561 --> 02:15:58,420
I was like no fucking way cause
I've been getting attention.

5145
02:15:58,510 --> 02:15:59,610
I know what drives me nuts,

5146
02:15:59,611 --> 02:15:59,910
man.

5147
02:15:59,910 --> 02:16:02,430
When someone tells me they talked to a
psychic and the psychic knew everything

5148
02:16:02,431 --> 02:16:02,791
about me.

5149
02:16:02,791 --> 02:16:03,624
Man,

5150
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:04,553
it's amazing.

5151
02:16:04,580 --> 02:16:05,180
Yeah.

5152
02:16:05,180 --> 02:16:05,640
Dude,

5153
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:06,421
I'm telling you man.

5154
02:16:06,421 --> 02:16:07,530
The psychic dude,

5155
02:16:07,531 --> 02:16:09,090
he knew he knew about my grandma.

5156
02:16:09,420 --> 02:16:10,120
Okay.

5157
02:16:10,120 --> 02:16:10,650
And you're like,

5158
02:16:10,650 --> 02:16:11,400
oh yeah,

5159
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:13,890
we need a name that begins with as a grit.

5160
02:16:16,230 --> 02:16:17,490
She a woman.

5161
02:16:19,510 --> 02:16:20,670
Would you say you were from Boston?

5162
02:16:20,990 --> 02:16:23,190
She's from the east coast.

5163
02:16:23,240 --> 02:16:23,611
I would,

5164
02:16:23,611 --> 02:16:24,030
you know,

5165
02:16:24,030 --> 02:16:26,850
I just know since your
grandmother was on the East Coast,

5166
02:16:27,060 --> 02:16:27,750
um,

5167
02:16:27,750 --> 02:16:29,440
what is your father alive?

5168
02:16:29,441 --> 02:16:29,591
No,

5169
02:16:29,591 --> 02:16:29,980
he wasn't.

5170
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:31,060
I didn't think he was.

5171
02:16:31,061 --> 02:16:31,894
No,

5172
02:16:32,260 --> 02:16:33,093
no.

5173
02:16:34,570 --> 02:16:34,901
Yes,

5174
02:16:34,901 --> 02:16:35,531
he was alive.

5175
02:16:35,531 --> 02:16:35,771
Yes,

5176
02:16:35,771 --> 02:16:36,281
that's right.

5177
02:16:36,281 --> 02:16:37,150
He was alive.

5178
02:16:37,390 --> 02:16:38,260
Your father was a lot of,

5179
02:16:38,261 --> 02:16:38,801
I see that.

5180
02:16:38,801 --> 02:16:39,634
It's amazing.

5181
02:16:40,030 --> 02:16:40,870
You see so much?

5182
02:16:40,900 --> 02:16:41,200
Yeah,

5183
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:44,620
we'll have a gift of sight
and these cards helped me.

5184
02:16:44,860 --> 02:16:45,521
These cards.

5185
02:16:45,521 --> 02:16:47,260
It's random cards with drawings on them.

5186
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:48,880
They help me to help me.

5187
02:16:48,881 --> 02:16:53,860
See what's hilarious is that no
one ever finds out any new shit.

5188
02:16:54,190 --> 02:16:55,300
They just tell you shit.

5189
02:16:55,301 --> 02:16:56,380
You already know you fuck.

5190
02:16:56,590 --> 02:16:57,700
Like you know dude,

5191
02:16:57,720 --> 02:16:57,880
he,

5192
02:16:57,880 --> 02:16:59,140
he knew all about my grandmother.

5193
02:16:59,320 --> 02:17:00,850
Don't you know all about your grandmother?

5194
02:17:00,940 --> 02:17:02,050
Jesus Christ son.

5195
02:17:02,510 --> 02:17:03,110
Why?

5196
02:17:03,110 --> 02:17:05,270
Why did you go somewhere to
tell you that green is green?

5197
02:17:05,570 --> 02:17:06,403
See that color green?

5198
02:17:07,260 --> 02:17:08,300
There's no better.

5199
02:17:08,330 --> 02:17:11,300
There's no better forecast for the future.

5200
02:17:11,301 --> 02:17:13,220
Then a Chinese fortune cookies.

5201
02:17:13,910 --> 02:17:14,930
I've based my life up.

5202
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:16,460
I had one a couple of months ago.

5203
02:17:16,461 --> 02:17:18,470
It said you are going to
come into a lot of money.

5204
02:17:18,471 --> 02:17:19,970
So I took it to the bank.

5205
02:17:19,980 --> 02:17:20,241
I was like,

5206
02:17:20,241 --> 02:17:21,074
can I get an advance?

5207
02:17:22,030 --> 02:17:22,863
Why

5208
02:17:26,220 --> 02:17:27,560
Catskills choke?

5209
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:33,800
How about the people that take them and
they the really good ones they save in

5210
02:17:33,801 --> 02:17:34,634
their wallet.

5211
02:17:35,810 --> 02:17:37,130
Show you guys,

5212
02:17:37,131 --> 02:17:39,060
your fucking dog may trust me.

5213
02:17:39,780 --> 02:17:40,521
Like modern ones.

5214
02:17:40,521 --> 02:17:41,190
There's different,

5215
02:17:41,190 --> 02:17:42,023
uh,

5216
02:17:42,090 --> 02:17:43,440
well why would they make new ones?

5217
02:17:43,441 --> 02:17:47,320
Just keep those fucking dumbass like
all the lottery throw this horoscope.

5218
02:17:49,130 --> 02:17:49,821
Who Cares?

5219
02:17:49,821 --> 02:17:51,020
People are always going
to eat Chinese food.

5220
02:17:51,021 --> 02:17:51,741
It's delicious.

5221
02:17:51,741 --> 02:17:53,240
Throw that stupid shit in there.

5222
02:17:53,660 --> 02:17:54,141
Some of them,

5223
02:17:54,141 --> 02:17:54,440
they are not,

5224
02:17:54,440 --> 02:17:54,850
you know,

5225
02:17:54,850 --> 02:17:58,220
unfortunate dented in San Francisco
and like 1902 makes sense.

5226
02:17:58,340 --> 02:17:59,091
I went to China.

5227
02:17:59,091 --> 02:17:59,361
I was like,

5228
02:17:59,361 --> 02:17:59,571
man,

5229
02:17:59,571 --> 02:18:00,404
where's my fortune cookie?

5230
02:18:00,690 --> 02:18:01,010
You don't,

5231
02:18:01,010 --> 02:18:02,190
you don't get cookies.

5232
02:18:02,191 --> 02:18:03,320
They never carried it over.

5233
02:18:03,720 --> 02:18:04,321
Well that's,

5234
02:18:04,321 --> 02:18:04,561
you know,

5235
02:18:04,561 --> 02:18:05,970
Chinese aren't really innovators.

5236
02:18:05,971 --> 02:18:06,181
You know,

5237
02:18:06,181 --> 02:18:07,320
they are they the copy.

5238
02:18:07,530 --> 02:18:09,870
I would think that they would make
it better Chinese fortune cookie.

5239
02:18:10,140 --> 02:18:10,980
The Bullock look,

5240
02:18:10,981 --> 02:18:11,191
you know,

5241
02:18:11,191 --> 02:18:11,551
you guys,

5242
02:18:11,551 --> 02:18:12,240
you had it down

5243
02:18:12,240 --> 02:18:13,650
but hologram it doesn't.

5244
02:18:13,651 --> 02:18:13,891
Yeah,

5245
02:18:13,891 --> 02:18:14,760
it's not dead.

5246
02:18:14,761 --> 02:18:15,900
Father should,

5247
02:18:15,930 --> 02:18:17,250
it should make a noise.

5248
02:18:18,350 --> 02:18:21,870
They always make the cheap shit like
the cheap knock offers and it's like

5249
02:18:21,871 --> 02:18:23,370
they're never making like the iPhone.

5250
02:18:23,371 --> 02:18:26,490
They're always making like the iPhone
or will they actually make I iPhones

5251
02:18:26,491 --> 02:18:27,000
there?

5252
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:27,271
Yeah.

5253
02:18:27,271 --> 02:18:29,490
I mean it's shine is
that massive industry.

5254
02:18:30,690 --> 02:18:32,010
A lot of Shit in China.

5255
02:18:32,290 --> 02:18:33,330
The iPhone factory,

5256
02:18:33,331 --> 02:18:36,690
they got the nets around it because all
these people were committing suicide.

5257
02:18:36,810 --> 02:18:37,560
Yeah.

5258
02:18:37,560 --> 02:18:38,910
Their answer was a,

5259
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:40,111
Hey,

5260
02:18:40,111 --> 02:18:40,944
get back to work.

5261
02:18:41,410 --> 02:18:44,340
That's based on the apple specs I'm
talking about like all the other company

5262
02:18:44,341 --> 02:18:44,730
outs there,

5263
02:18:44,730 --> 02:18:45,451
companies out there,

5264
02:18:45,451 --> 02:18:45,980
you know,

5265
02:18:45,980 --> 02:18:47,100
there's definitely a lot of that.

5266
02:18:47,130 --> 02:18:48,150
There's a lot of cheap shit.

5267
02:18:48,370 --> 02:18:51,030
You mean made in China was
always like a statement,

5268
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:51,550
right?

5269
02:18:51,550 --> 02:18:54,370
Where else are you going to get
refrigerator magnets and snow?

5270
02:18:54,520 --> 02:18:55,860
And I looked at it and it said,

5271
02:18:55,861 --> 02:18:57,970
made in shine a black,

5272
02:19:03,540 --> 02:19:06,180
but they also make some
fucking pretty dope shit.

5273
02:19:06,630 --> 02:19:07,710
What's really funny is that,

5274
02:19:08,430 --> 02:19:09,150
that uh,

5275
02:19:09,150 --> 02:19:10,110
that company,

5276
02:19:10,111 --> 02:19:10,441
the,

5277
02:19:10,441 --> 02:19:10,890
uh,

5278
02:19:10,890 --> 02:19:12,060
where people were jumping off the roof,

5279
02:19:12,061 --> 02:19:12,810
what was it called again?

5280
02:19:12,810 --> 02:19:13,291
Foxconn.

5281
02:19:13,291 --> 02:19:14,124
Foxconn.

5282
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:15,060
Foxconn.

5283
02:19:15,150 --> 02:19:16,790
The argument was this,

5284
02:19:16,890 --> 02:19:18,780
I actually saw a guy saying this.

5285
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:19,561
He was saying,

5286
02:19:19,561 --> 02:19:19,980
well,

5287
02:19:19,980 --> 02:19:24,630
you have to realize that this is an
enormous company and the percentage of

5288
02:19:24,631 --> 02:19:29,540
people that are committing suicide is
with the percentage of people in a normal

5289
02:19:29,541 --> 02:19:31,010
population of that many.

5290
02:19:31,310 --> 02:19:34,280
You're talking about a company that
employs a half a million people.

5291
02:19:35,180 --> 02:19:35,390
Yeah.

5292
02:19:35,390 --> 02:19:37,190
But the killing themselves at work,

5293
02:19:37,680 --> 02:19:39,200
right at work,

5294
02:19:40,790 --> 02:19:41,960
the live at work,

5295
02:19:42,110 --> 02:19:42,590
they're killing.

5296
02:19:42,590 --> 02:19:42,771
I mean,

5297
02:19:42,771 --> 02:19:43,190
is it,

5298
02:19:43,190 --> 02:19:43,761
are you really,

5299
02:19:43,761 --> 02:19:46,190
can you really say that they're
like a regular population,

5300
02:19:46,640 --> 02:19:49,490
extra pee break and they just get nothing.

5301
02:19:49,520 --> 02:19:53,090
They get very little money
and they claw and scratch.

5302
02:19:54,230 --> 02:19:57,620
Just the fact that we still allow that
someone's kind of come up with something

5303
02:19:57,621 --> 02:19:59,030
called the fair phone.

5304
02:19:59,030 --> 02:19:59,863
Have you heard of that?

5305
02:20:00,590 --> 02:20:01,423
Pull it up?

5306
02:20:01,940 --> 02:20:02,241
Yeah,

5307
02:20:02,241 --> 02:20:04,040
it's a phone they're trying to do.

5308
02:20:04,070 --> 02:20:06,190
It's a to you son of a bitch.

5309
02:20:07,670 --> 02:20:08,503
It's a,

5310
02:20:09,020 --> 02:20:09,591
it's a,

5311
02:20:09,591 --> 02:20:10,790
an android phone.

5312
02:20:11,210 --> 02:20:12,290
And um,

5313
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:16,820
I think the idea is that they can trace
the origins of all the resources that

5314
02:20:16,821 --> 02:20:17,370
are in the phone,

5315
02:20:17,370 --> 02:20:21,580
minerals and such and show you that it's
all been acquired to fair trade and it

5316
02:20:21,581 --> 02:20:23,450
hasn't been a slave labor used.

5317
02:20:23,451 --> 02:20:24,284
And you know,

5318
02:20:24,620 --> 02:20:26,060
that seems like a boring phone.

5319
02:20:26,420 --> 02:20:26,571
Well,

5320
02:20:26,571 --> 02:20:26,930
they can't,

5321
02:20:26,930 --> 02:20:28,370
it's not even going to have four G,

5322
02:20:28,870 --> 02:20:29,660
which is,

5323
02:20:29,660 --> 02:20:29,901
I mean,

5324
02:20:29,901 --> 02:20:31,490
it looks like a regular android phone.

5325
02:20:32,090 --> 02:20:32,781
What is their,

5326
02:20:32,781 --> 02:20:33,051
uh,

5327
02:20:33,051 --> 02:20:33,401
their,

5328
02:20:33,401 --> 02:20:34,234
their spiel?

5329
02:20:36,210 --> 02:20:38,970
She didn't say products and made by
starting with a single phone together,

5330
02:20:38,971 --> 02:20:42,690
we're opening up the supply chain and
redefining the economy one step at a time.

5331
02:20:43,030 --> 02:20:44,110
I love the idea.

5332
02:20:44,230 --> 02:20:45,610
I think the idea is amazing,

5333
02:20:45,611 --> 02:20:46,090
you know,

5334
02:20:46,090 --> 02:20:47,920
but you got to have four g stupid.

5335
02:20:48,190 --> 02:20:49,023
How dare you,

5336
02:20:49,150 --> 02:20:52,510
how dare you put out a phone
in 2000 and fucking 13 and say,

5337
02:20:52,511 --> 02:20:54,550
well for Lte was problematic,

5338
02:20:54,551 --> 02:20:58,180
then your fucking phone is
problematic because I would jump on,

5339
02:20:58,181 --> 02:20:59,140
everybody would jump on.

5340
02:20:59,450 --> 02:20:59,951
You can do it,

5341
02:20:59,951 --> 02:21:00,460
man.

5342
02:21:00,460 --> 02:21:02,020
Just make it four g silly.

5343
02:21:02,320 --> 02:21:03,280
Get the funding gap.

5344
02:21:03,790 --> 02:21:05,830
Get a Kickstarter like Graham Hancock.

5345
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:08,080
He has another Kickstarter.

5346
02:21:08,260 --> 02:21:08,830
Alex Grey,

5347
02:21:08,830 --> 02:21:09,280
sorry.

5348
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:10,113
Sorry Graham.

5349
02:21:10,570 --> 02:21:12,880
Alex Grey's Kickstarter hit $250,000.

5350
02:21:14,410 --> 02:21:15,800
So that ends the on thing that he's,

5351
02:21:16,050 --> 02:21:16,301
you know,

5352
02:21:16,301 --> 02:21:17,134
Alex,

5353
02:21:17,490 --> 02:21:17,680
no,

5354
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:18,513
Alex Graves,

5355
02:21:18,610 --> 02:21:19,600
the visionary artists.

5356
02:21:19,660 --> 02:21:20,680
It was really psychedelic,

5357
02:21:20,770 --> 02:21:22,150
crazy trip to mean art.

5358
02:21:22,990 --> 02:21:23,920
You never seen his stuff.

5359
02:21:24,340 --> 02:21:24,610
Oh,

5360
02:21:24,610 --> 02:21:25,270
it was amazing.

5361
02:21:25,270 --> 02:21:25,451
Oh,

5362
02:21:25,451 --> 02:21:26,240
here it's like this,

5363
02:21:26,240 --> 02:21:27,073
this,

5364
02:21:27,320 --> 02:21:28,520
this visions book.

5365
02:21:28,930 --> 02:21:29,763
Alex.

5366
02:21:29,890 --> 02:21:30,340
Cool.

5367
02:21:30,340 --> 02:21:31,330
You're seeing that stuff before.

5368
02:21:31,360 --> 02:21:31,531
Yeah,

5369
02:21:31,531 --> 02:21:31,731
yeah,

5370
02:21:31,731 --> 02:21:31,971
yeah.

5371
02:21:31,971 --> 02:21:32,804
It makes sure you have,

5372
02:21:33,130 --> 02:21:33,640
but uh,

5373
02:21:33,640 --> 02:21:34,473
he's um,

5374
02:21:34,570 --> 02:21:36,970
creating that like the cover of this uh,

5375
02:21:37,330 --> 02:21:37,780
um,

5376
02:21:37,780 --> 02:21:38,650
visions book.

5377
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:40,720
He's creating something that's,

5378
02:21:41,110 --> 02:21:41,890
that's beautiful.

5379
02:21:41,890 --> 02:21:42,723
That cover.

5380
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:43,750
Yeah.

5381
02:21:43,750 --> 02:21:46,120
He's creating something
really similar to this,

5382
02:21:46,121 --> 02:21:47,620
like this style of art.

5383
02:21:47,650 --> 02:21:48,161
Like this,

5384
02:21:48,161 --> 02:21:49,990
the style thing as a building,

5385
02:21:50,680 --> 02:21:53,350
he's going to have a religious
building called the end theone.

5386
02:21:53,860 --> 02:21:57,940
That's like this nondenominational
spiritual sort of
building that he's putting

5387
02:21:57,941 --> 02:21:58,751
together and it's going to,

5388
02:21:58,751 --> 02:22:03,250
how's it inside this building that's
created essentially out of psychedelic art

5389
02:22:03,790 --> 02:22:06,490
and he did a Kickstarter and
offered a lot of really cool shit,

5390
02:22:06,760 --> 02:22:11,110
including painting people's personal
or drawing people's personal pictures,

5391
02:22:11,111 --> 02:22:11,580
drawing,

5392
02:22:11,580 --> 02:22:14,740
drawing of an Alex Gray version
of them and a lot of cool shit.

5393
02:22:14,840 --> 02:22:18,500
I need to do a Kickstarter to get a
condo somewhere nice and like Malibu or

5394
02:22:18,501 --> 02:22:19,334
something.

5395
02:22:21,940 --> 02:22:23,540
I'll make it spiritual if you want me to.

5396
02:22:23,541 --> 02:22:25,590
We can all smoke weed if you want.

5397
02:22:26,190 --> 02:22:26,850
Well,

5398
02:22:26,850 --> 02:22:27,511
thousand bucks,

5399
02:22:27,511 --> 02:22:29,710
you get to crash on the couch once.

5400
02:22:30,240 --> 02:22:30,790
That's all right.

5401
02:22:30,790 --> 02:22:32,400
That's not how Kickstarter works on.

5402
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:33,770
They have to get something out of it too.

5403
02:22:33,790 --> 02:22:33,901
Well,

5404
02:22:33,901 --> 02:22:38,880
I'll film it and you guys can all download
me and my new condo in Malibu Sucking

5405
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:39,713
Dick.

5406
02:22:40,280 --> 02:22:41,760
Why did you say suck it today,

5407
02:22:43,650 --> 02:22:44,483
Brian there.

5408
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:49,350
Just think about what you're saying
and then count to three and then stay.

5409
02:22:49,380 --> 02:22:50,610
Stay with the thought and he goes,

5410
02:22:50,611 --> 02:22:51,390
this worth saying,

5411
02:22:51,390 --> 02:22:51,521
I mean,

5412
02:22:51,521 --> 02:22:52,650
it's like you can't,

5413
02:22:52,680 --> 02:22:53,250
um,

5414
02:22:53,250 --> 02:22:55,970
you can't just have a Kickstarter
to get yourself a condos on.

5415
02:22:56,040 --> 02:22:56,161
No,

5416
02:22:56,161 --> 02:22:56,521
you can't.

5417
02:22:56,521 --> 02:22:56,630
Well,

5418
02:22:56,630 --> 02:22:58,080
you can do is you could say,

5419
02:22:58,081 --> 02:22:58,261
Hey,

5420
02:22:58,261 --> 02:23:03,261
I'm making a documentary about me getting
a super sick condo in Malibu and I

5421
02:23:05,101 --> 02:23:07,380
need 300 and no.

5422
02:23:07,540 --> 02:23:07,740
Well,

5423
02:23:07,740 --> 02:23:08,940
$200,000.

5424
02:23:09,110 --> 02:23:09,960
To tell you what Brian,

5425
02:23:10,020 --> 02:23:15,020
nobody would see that comment that is
basically bulletproof and no one would

5426
02:23:15,151 --> 02:23:16,050
ever call scam.

5427
02:23:16,260 --> 02:23:16,741
They would say,

5428
02:23:16,741 --> 02:23:17,370
hey,

5429
02:23:17,370 --> 02:23:21,870
you're just doing this so that you could
get this super dope condo or buddy.

5430
02:23:21,990 --> 02:23:22,560
Uh,

5431
02:23:22,560 --> 02:23:23,393
John,

5432
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:24,010
uh,

5433
02:23:24,010 --> 02:23:25,140
has a nice Kickstarter.

5434
02:23:25,490 --> 02:23:26,323
Schwab,

5435
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:28,240
what is his,

5436
02:23:28,240 --> 02:23:28,750
uh,

5437
02:23:28,750 --> 02:23:29,583
Les Schwab,

5438
02:23:30,210 --> 02:23:30,690
Schwab.

5439
02:23:30,690 --> 02:23:30,961
I,

5440
02:23:30,961 --> 02:23:31,531
it's too,

5441
02:23:31,531 --> 02:23:32,220
uh,

5442
02:23:32,220 --> 02:23:33,840
for him to become super rich.

5443
02:23:34,290 --> 02:23:35,280
That's the whole Kickstarter.

5444
02:23:36,070 --> 02:23:40,000
John was Wa you may recognize me
from my popular youtube videos,

5445
02:23:40,060 --> 02:23:40,721
televisions,

5446
02:23:40,721 --> 02:23:41,320
the league,

5447
02:23:41,320 --> 02:23:45,280
or simply as someone you admire an
envy because I'm awesome and famous.

5448
02:23:45,530 --> 02:23:47,790
My fans come up to me all
the time and asked me,

5449
02:23:48,250 --> 02:23:48,970
John,

5450
02:23:48,970 --> 02:23:50,440
what aren't you going to make a movie?

5451
02:23:51,130 --> 02:23:52,690
My answer is always the same.

5452
02:23:52,720 --> 02:23:53,760
It's bodyguard

5453
02:23:53,940 --> 02:23:57,310
beat the shit out of this gross poor
person who's not addressing me as surly

5454
02:23:57,320 --> 02:23:58,153
Schwab.

5455
02:23:58,230 --> 02:24:00,880
A second most common
question I get from my fans.

5456
02:24:01,060 --> 02:24:01,893
Stop right there.

5457
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:03,120
If I was his friend,

5458
02:24:03,360 --> 02:24:04,193
I'd say edit that.

5459
02:24:05,290 --> 02:24:09,090
What was that part I didn't get with
that part was parts called not funny.

5460
02:24:11,770 --> 02:24:13,050
They just swing,

5461
02:24:13,950 --> 02:24:14,783
didn't work.

5462
02:24:15,180 --> 02:24:16,140
He's a funny guy.

5463
02:24:16,170 --> 02:24:17,910
You know we all fucking
throw turns up there.

5464
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:20,970
Actually we was trying to do,

5465
02:24:21,410 --> 02:24:22,230
didn't work.

5466
02:24:22,230 --> 02:24:22,681
Oh man,

5467
02:24:22,681 --> 02:24:23,260
you were great.

5468
02:24:23,260 --> 02:24:25,420
The last time I saw you
at the laugh factory.

5469
02:24:25,421 --> 02:24:26,590
It was like six months ago.

5470
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:27,240
Oh thanks man.

5471
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:28,073
Thank you.

5472
02:24:28,570 --> 02:24:29,700
Dig Bit about that.

5473
02:24:29,701 --> 02:24:31,180
The horse fuck video.

5474
02:24:31,390 --> 02:24:31,901
Ah Damn.

5475
02:24:31,901 --> 02:24:32,680
It was,

5476
02:24:32,680 --> 02:24:33,850
it was like a 10 minute bit.

5477
02:24:33,851 --> 02:24:34,570
It was straight.

5478
02:24:34,570 --> 02:24:36,640
I was just there and
it's called Enim cloth.

5479
02:24:36,670 --> 02:24:37,210
Oh really?

5480
02:24:37,210 --> 02:24:37,990
I was just there.

5481
02:24:37,990 --> 02:24:38,281
Yeah,

5482
02:24:38,281 --> 02:24:39,640
and they're all very embarrassed about it.

5483
02:24:39,641 --> 02:24:40,241
It's really interesting.

5484
02:24:40,241 --> 02:24:42,460
I like brass plaques up marking.

5485
02:24:42,790 --> 02:24:44,260
Well it's a real rural area.

5486
02:24:44,290 --> 02:24:46,060
It's at the base of a mountain.

5487
02:24:46,061 --> 02:24:47,260
I think it's a Mount Rainier.

5488
02:24:47,610 --> 02:24:48,260
It's to the,

5489
02:24:48,260 --> 02:24:51,840
it's one of those mountain communities
and they were really bummed out that

5490
02:24:51,841 --> 02:24:52,674
their,

5491
02:24:53,130 --> 02:24:54,940
their town is known for that now.

5492
02:24:54,970 --> 02:24:55,930
Like you ask him about it.

5493
02:24:55,931 --> 02:24:56,200
They were,

5494
02:24:56,200 --> 02:24:58,120
there's a few like really nice.

5495
02:24:58,121 --> 02:25:01,240
There's a place called Charlie's shout
out to Charlie's the best fucking

5496
02:25:01,241 --> 02:25:02,440
pancakes you'll ever eat in your life,

5497
02:25:02,441 --> 02:25:03,130
man.

5498
02:25:03,130 --> 02:25:03,970
And eat claw.

5499
02:25:04,180 --> 02:25:05,170
Pretty fucking dynamite.

5500
02:25:05,171 --> 02:25:07,150
It's like a real like home cooking place.

5501
02:25:07,360 --> 02:25:08,550
We were up there looking for bigfoot

5502
02:25:10,180 --> 02:25:11,170
for this new show I'm doing

5503
02:25:13,150 --> 02:25:14,870
isn't the definition of looking.

5504
02:25:14,900 --> 02:25:17,080
There has to be something to actually see.

5505
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:18,900
Brian is,

5506
02:25:18,901 --> 02:25:21,040
you're not the expert of
everything doesn't exist.

5507
02:25:21,041 --> 02:25:21,874
You're not looking.

5508
02:25:21,910 --> 02:25:24,040
Oh you say it doesn't exist,

5509
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:26,400
but how do you know that's
like looking for goats.

5510
02:25:26,450 --> 02:25:28,720
You can't really look for
wine and it doesn't exist,

5511
02:25:29,170 --> 02:25:29,950
which you can,

5512
02:25:29,950 --> 02:25:31,030
you can go look for ghosts.

5513
02:25:31,410 --> 02:25:32,590
It doesn't mean you're
going to find it goes.

5514
02:25:32,591 --> 02:25:35,380
But if there are ghosts
occasionally and you're not looking,

5515
02:25:35,500 --> 02:25:36,400
you're never going to find them.

5516
02:25:36,401 --> 02:25:37,660
And if you're living your whole life,

5517
02:25:37,661 --> 02:25:38,590
never seen a ghost do you?

5518
02:25:38,591 --> 02:25:40,660
Like there's no fucking goes.

5519
02:25:40,930 --> 02:25:42,820
And then one day you see a ghost,

5520
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,790
you shit yourself and you
don't have a picture of it.

5521
02:25:45,840 --> 02:25:46,930
You can never explain it.

5522
02:25:46,931 --> 02:25:48,640
And you try to tell people and they like,

5523
02:25:48,641 --> 02:25:48,941
yeah,

5524
02:25:48,941 --> 02:25:52,360
you saw it ghost because no one's going
to ever believe anything that they

5525
02:25:52,361 --> 02:25:53,320
haven't seen themselves.

5526
02:25:53,560 --> 02:25:56,440
Unless you could show me a picture
of it unless you can show me.

5527
02:25:56,650 --> 02:25:58,120
I don't even believe in quantum theory.

5528
02:25:58,121 --> 02:25:58,541
You know why?

5529
02:25:58,541 --> 02:25:59,500
Cause he can't show it to me.

5530
02:25:59,650 --> 02:26:00,483
I don't know what you're doing.

5531
02:26:00,520 --> 02:26:01,200
I show all,

5532
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:02,470
see all those lines and squiggles.

5533
02:26:02,620 --> 02:26:03,790
I believe you're correct.

5534
02:26:03,791 --> 02:26:04,870
I would never doubt,

5535
02:26:05,140 --> 02:26:05,620
but I don't,

5536
02:26:05,620 --> 02:26:07,120
I have no idea if that's real.

5537
02:26:07,240 --> 02:26:08,350
I have no idea if that's real,

5538
02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:09,873
but big foot.

5539
02:26:11,050 --> 02:26:11,883
I think he's real.

5540
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:12,191
You know,

5541
02:26:12,191 --> 02:26:13,690
you do not think he's real.

5542
02:26:13,691 --> 02:26:16,060
Tom Rounds the tell you what man.

5543
02:26:16,090 --> 02:26:16,421
Hey man,

5544
02:26:16,421 --> 02:26:17,254
if anything's real,

5545
02:26:17,300 --> 02:26:18,110
you're entitled.

5546
02:26:18,110 --> 02:26:19,420
That the only thing is real.

5547
02:26:19,450 --> 02:26:20,221
I think Eddie Murphy,

5548
02:26:20,221 --> 02:26:21,054
he's a better actor.

5549
02:26:21,070 --> 02:26:21,940
Denzel Washington

5550
02:26:23,530 --> 02:26:25,210
or you be serious.

5551
02:26:25,211 --> 02:26:26,044
You're just being silly.

5552
02:26:26,090 --> 02:26:27,010
I think we all have,

5553
02:26:27,011 --> 02:26:28,370
we're all entitled to our opinions.

5554
02:26:28,820 --> 02:26:30,750
Seriously being silly because any,

5555
02:26:30,800 --> 02:26:31,870
if we can act as dicta up,

5556
02:26:32,020 --> 02:26:33,220
he just doesn't do it very often.

5557
02:26:33,221 --> 02:26:34,540
I think he acted it already.

5558
02:26:34,630 --> 02:26:37,900
I bet he did his bed at best acting when
the cops asked him why that training

5559
02:26:37,901 --> 02:26:38,734
was in his car.

5560
02:26:40,300 --> 02:26:41,860
It was a little character.

5561
02:26:42,490 --> 02:26:44,050
Do the research.

5562
02:26:44,140 --> 02:26:46,990
I was taking him home officer,

5563
02:26:47,020 --> 02:26:47,890
that is ain't homeless.

5564
02:26:47,891 --> 02:26:49,510
Tranny explained yourself,

5565
02:26:53,620 --> 02:26:55,390
but I guarantee you that,

5566
02:26:55,420 --> 02:26:55,601
I mean,

5567
02:26:55,601 --> 02:26:57,370
look at how good he was and um,

5568
02:26:57,490 --> 02:26:57,740
uh,

5569
02:26:57,740 --> 02:26:59,500
the nick naulty 48 hours,

5570
02:26:59,620 --> 02:27:01,000
it's fucking great in that movie.

5571
02:27:01,001 --> 02:27:01,271
Great.

5572
02:27:01,271 --> 02:27:02,650
As an actor as well,

5573
02:27:02,830 --> 02:27:05,500
like not just great as a bad
guy and you know what else,

5574
02:27:06,170 --> 02:27:07,630
what was he like four
different characters.

5575
02:27:07,631 --> 02:27:08,464
That's something that,

5576
02:27:08,870 --> 02:27:10,360
and I'm not endorsing
this movie in any way,

5577
02:27:10,361 --> 02:27:10,990
shape or form,

5578
02:27:10,990 --> 02:27:12,970
but that Ben Stiller movie about,

5579
02:27:12,980 --> 02:27:13,450
uh,

5580
02:27:13,450 --> 02:27:14,710
the robbery,

5581
02:27:14,711 --> 02:27:16,870
the fucking there was on the top floor,

5582
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:18,190
the penthouse something.

5583
02:27:18,530 --> 02:27:19,363
It was like,

5584
02:27:20,200 --> 02:27:21,033
what the hell was that called?

5585
02:27:21,310 --> 02:27:23,200
The heist heist heist.

5586
02:27:23,650 --> 02:27:25,090
Not a bad movie really was,

5587
02:27:25,210 --> 02:27:25,431
it got,

5588
02:27:25,431 --> 02:27:26,081
took a lot of shit.

5589
02:27:26,081 --> 02:27:26,710
It was pretty fun.

5590
02:27:26,710 --> 02:27:27,940
The premise is ridiculous,

5591
02:27:27,941 --> 02:27:31,360
but Eddie Murphy's a
bad ass fucking actor.

5592
02:27:31,361 --> 02:27:31,511
Like,

5593
02:27:31,511 --> 02:27:33,400
you forget how subtly is like,

5594
02:27:33,401 --> 02:27:35,300
how he could pull shit off though.

5595
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:36,070
You know,

5596
02:27:36,070 --> 02:27:39,790
it's really sad that all that trainee
shit went down because when that trainee

5597
02:27:39,791 --> 02:27:40,391
shit went down,

5598
02:27:40,391 --> 02:27:41,730
Eddie Murphy stopped doing stand up,

5599
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:43,000
you know,

5600
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:44,320
he did raw and then,

5601
02:27:44,321 --> 02:27:44,531
you know,

5602
02:27:44,531 --> 02:27:48,940
he kinda like just went to movies and
maybe he would have went back 10 years

5603
02:27:49,360 --> 02:27:51,740
after raw and then the
trainee thing was it?

5604
02:27:52,010 --> 02:27:52,261
Yeah,

5605
02:27:52,261 --> 02:27:54,130
it was a than my timeline's wrong,

5606
02:27:54,280 --> 02:27:58,450
but I just feel like maybe he
would've gone back to it if it wasn't.

5607
02:27:58,451 --> 02:27:59,110
I wish she would've.

5608
02:27:59,110 --> 02:28:01,660
That's why I was excited when he was
going to host the Oscars that like,

5609
02:28:01,990 --> 02:28:03,310
just give us a hint of it,

5610
02:28:03,311 --> 02:28:03,580
Eddie,

5611
02:28:03,580 --> 02:28:04,990
just a couple of minutes.

5612
02:28:05,530 --> 02:28:06,640
This is the truth.

5613
02:28:06,760 --> 02:28:09,040
When Raul came out and I was,

5614
02:28:09,041 --> 02:28:09,340
uh,

5615
02:28:09,340 --> 02:28:10,480
I don't know how old I was,

5616
02:28:10,481 --> 02:28:12,730
I guess I was probably 18
or something like that.

5617
02:28:12,731 --> 02:28:13,564
I don't remember.

5618
02:28:13,580 --> 02:28:14,470
Somewhere around that.

5619
02:28:14,471 --> 02:28:15,880
Somewhere around the teenage years.

5620
02:28:16,120 --> 02:28:18,870
And I remember seeing raw on TV and we,

5621
02:28:18,940 --> 02:28:22,100
me and my friends were fucking crying.

5622
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:26,150
We're crying and it doesn't totally hold
up today because a lot of the premises

5623
02:28:26,151 --> 02:28:28,160
have been like beaten down since then.

5624
02:28:28,161 --> 02:28:28,994
A lot.

5625
02:28:29,100 --> 02:28:30,740
I remember that was an
event when it came out,

5626
02:28:30,741 --> 02:28:31,610
it was in the theaters,

5627
02:28:32,360 --> 02:28:33,800
but you coming off a delirious,

5628
02:28:33,801 --> 02:28:35,420
delirious was so strong.

5629
02:28:35,450 --> 02:28:35,601
Oh,

5630
02:28:35,601 --> 02:28:36,080
you know what?

5631
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:40,070
Every moment and then it was like he
had gotten money and then he's telling

5632
02:28:40,071 --> 02:28:43,810
stories about bodyguards and bill
Cosby actually meant delirium.

5633
02:28:43,960 --> 02:28:45,340
Delirious said that because yeah,

5634
02:28:45,350 --> 02:28:46,940
I told this was the TV one.

5635
02:28:47,060 --> 02:28:49,510
That was the HBO where he's in the back,

5636
02:28:49,880 --> 02:28:51,350
the movie and he's got the blue suit.

5637
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:51,831
No,

5638
02:28:51,831 --> 02:28:55,340
I definitely met you and your
friends were really laughable.

5639
02:28:55,420 --> 02:28:57,500
Rod Rod was not that good.

5640
02:28:57,560 --> 02:28:57,981
That's it.

5641
02:28:57,981 --> 02:28:58,280
That's it.

5642
02:28:58,280 --> 02:28:58,410
No,

5643
02:28:58,410 --> 02:28:58,760
that was like,

5644
02:28:58,760 --> 02:29:00,830
it was like when rap
guys get too much money,

5645
02:29:01,340 --> 02:29:02,450
when they rap guys come out,

5646
02:29:02,451 --> 02:29:02,961
they're great.

5647
02:29:02,961 --> 02:29:04,940
The first three albums or from the street,

5648
02:29:04,941 --> 02:29:07,070
they got the message
and then like the third,

5649
02:29:07,071 --> 02:29:07,904
fourth album,

5650
02:29:07,970 --> 02:29:08,271
dude,

5651
02:29:08,271 --> 02:29:10,130
who's going to clean my pool is late.

5652
02:29:10,760 --> 02:29:11,593
You know,

5653
02:29:11,620 --> 02:29:14,790
there's some of that money that takes
the sting out of a lot of people and then

5654
02:29:15,050 --> 02:29:15,350
awesome.

5655
02:29:15,350 --> 02:29:17,370
Then he had gotten a
few live changes round.

5656
02:29:17,371 --> 02:29:17,870
Yeah,

5657
02:29:17,870 --> 02:29:18,703
yeah.

5658
02:29:19,060 --> 02:29:20,690
You know the life you live as a comedian,

5659
02:29:20,900 --> 02:29:22,400
there's gotta be some folly in it,

5660
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:23,241
you know,

5661
02:29:23,241 --> 02:29:26,420
and when everyone's just lining up to
suck your Dick and pay you in diamonds,

5662
02:29:26,460 --> 02:29:27,900
this is not a lot of the following.

5663
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:29,651
Did you see that,

5664
02:29:29,651 --> 02:29:30,620
that Eddie Murphy thing?

5665
02:29:30,621 --> 02:29:31,760
Well it was on comedy central.

5666
02:29:31,761 --> 02:29:32,210
They,

5667
02:29:32,210 --> 02:29:32,780
um,

5668
02:29:32,780 --> 02:29:33,613
they did some like,

5669
02:29:33,650 --> 02:29:34,011
you know,

5670
02:29:34,011 --> 02:29:38,000
honor him evening and who
was it told this great story?

5671
02:29:38,060 --> 02:29:38,893
Um,

5672
02:29:39,650 --> 02:29:40,161
oh my God,

5673
02:29:40,161 --> 02:29:40,940
I forgot it.

5674
02:29:40,940 --> 02:29:41,860
It's a,

5675
02:29:42,600 --> 02:29:45,170
but I guess it was
Arsenio Hall or something.

5676
02:29:45,171 --> 02:29:50,171
And some woman comes over there at like
some black club and some white woman

5677
02:29:50,271 --> 02:29:51,470
comes over to Eddie Murphy goes,

5678
02:29:51,471 --> 02:29:51,861
Eddie,

5679
02:29:51,861 --> 02:29:52,161
Eddie,

5680
02:29:52,161 --> 02:29:52,940
I love you.

5681
02:29:52,940 --> 02:29:53,773
I've never,

5682
02:29:53,930 --> 02:29:55,460
I never kissed a,

5683
02:29:55,560 --> 02:29:56,210
uh,

5684
02:29:56,210 --> 02:29:57,260
a black man before.

5685
02:29:57,260 --> 02:29:58,093
Can I kiss you?

5686
02:29:58,310 --> 02:29:58,821
And he goes,

5687
02:29:58,821 --> 02:29:59,654
no.

5688
02:30:00,350 --> 02:30:00,651
He goes,

5689
02:30:00,651 --> 02:30:01,880
you don't start at the top.

5690
02:30:02,090 --> 02:30:03,620
You got to start with one of these poor.

5691
02:30:05,150 --> 02:30:06,440
And that's fine.

5692
02:30:08,090 --> 02:30:09,260
You can't start at the top.

5693
02:30:09,261 --> 02:30:10,300
Pay Delirious.

5694
02:30:10,301 --> 02:30:10,491
You know,

5695
02:30:10,491 --> 02:30:11,360
before delirious,

5696
02:30:11,361 --> 02:30:12,290
he had a CD.

5697
02:30:12,590 --> 02:30:13,460
I don't even have a CD.

5698
02:30:13,461 --> 02:30:14,330
I think it was like a set,

5699
02:30:14,750 --> 02:30:16,610
but he had a cassette
that was really good.

5700
02:30:16,640 --> 02:30:20,520
I think maybe even better than delirious
cause it was really like low pressure.

5701
02:30:20,690 --> 02:30:21,980
Give delirious has a gift.

5702
02:30:21,981 --> 02:30:22,280
I got,

5703
02:30:22,280 --> 02:30:25,990
I get a little nephew man and he likes
comedy and then like the lyrics a little

5704
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:27,620
like teenage kids and stuff,

5705
02:30:27,740 --> 02:30:28,573
they want to like,

5706
02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:29,473
uh,

5707
02:30:29,900 --> 02:30:30,171
you know,

5708
02:30:30,171 --> 02:30:30,530
they asked me,

5709
02:30:30,530 --> 02:30:30,741
you know,

5710
02:30:30,741 --> 02:30:31,220
who should I,

5711
02:30:31,220 --> 02:30:32,090
who should I study?

5712
02:30:32,660 --> 02:30:33,471
Here's delirious.

5713
02:30:33,471 --> 02:30:34,580
Let's start start here.

5714
02:30:35,250 --> 02:30:38,990
If you're like a teenager and you're
not really into radical shit yet,

5715
02:30:39,110 --> 02:30:40,430
you just send the solid funny,

5716
02:30:41,150 --> 02:30:42,470
it's too bad that he stopped.

5717
02:30:42,620 --> 02:30:43,370
You know,

5718
02:30:43,370 --> 02:30:43,950
it's interesting,

5719
02:30:43,950 --> 02:30:44,241
you know,

5720
02:30:44,241 --> 02:30:45,074
there was also,

5721
02:30:45,410 --> 02:30:46,290
it's just a,

5722
02:30:46,640 --> 02:30:51,610
I'm sure when you're probably the number
one comedy movie star in the world,

5723
02:30:51,670 --> 02:30:56,170
like it's probably really hard to get
up a desire to go write and create new

5724
02:30:56,171 --> 02:30:59,590
jokes and they're probably just constantly
shoving movies down his face back

5725
02:30:59,591 --> 02:31:00,280
then.

5726
02:31:00,280 --> 02:31:00,461
You know,

5727
02:31:00,461 --> 02:31:04,210
he went in after 48 hours
and I mean he was gigantic,

5728
02:31:04,660 --> 02:31:05,261
gigantic.

5729
02:31:05,261 --> 02:31:06,094
He was,

5730
02:31:06,840 --> 02:31:07,830
I liked the party,

5731
02:31:07,831 --> 02:31:08,664
Yada.

5732
02:31:09,590 --> 02:31:09,780
No,

5733
02:31:09,780 --> 02:31:10,830
it's my girl wants to

5734
02:31:13,690 --> 02:31:17,210
had a hit song and dance song.

5735
02:31:17,240 --> 02:31:19,950
It was a hit song about his
girl who to party all the time.

5736
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:23,010
That is a drag man.

5737
02:31:23,220 --> 02:31:26,310
If you're dating a girl and she just
wants to go out all the time and dance and

5738
02:31:26,311 --> 02:31:27,000
party.

5739
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:30,960
I don't like the friends I've met friends
break up of girls cause they just want

5740
02:31:30,961 --> 02:31:33,240
a party all the time to like listen,

5741
02:31:33,390 --> 02:31:34,110
okay you're,

5742
02:31:34,110 --> 02:31:35,820
you're escaping something here.

5743
02:31:36,300 --> 02:31:38,190
We can't do coke seven nights in a row.

5744
02:31:38,280 --> 02:31:39,100
All right.

5745
02:31:39,100 --> 02:31:39,933
Keep needed.

5746
02:31:40,110 --> 02:31:43,590
He needed to take a nap
and you need to get a help.

5747
02:31:43,591 --> 02:31:44,310
Wanted,

5748
02:31:44,310 --> 02:31:44,581
look,

5749
02:31:44,581 --> 02:31:45,420
pick up that.

5750
02:31:45,510 --> 02:31:46,650
Finding an occupation.

5751
02:31:46,651 --> 02:31:51,651
You can't just be out there partying
or you can forget it if you got an act,

5752
02:31:52,500 --> 02:31:53,010
you know,

5753
02:31:53,010 --> 02:31:54,780
travel the country Tom road style.

5754
02:31:54,810 --> 02:31:55,950
Just go gangster.

5755
02:31:56,840 --> 02:31:57,760
Tell it road the road.

5756
02:31:57,761 --> 02:31:58,770
Glad you clarified that.

5757
02:31:58,771 --> 02:31:59,011
You're like,

5758
02:31:59,011 --> 02:31:59,940
you can't party all the time.

5759
02:31:59,950 --> 02:32:01,800
I'm like oh parties all the time.

5760
02:32:06,030 --> 02:32:07,170
Do you ever think that a,

5761
02:32:07,171 --> 02:32:08,400
you're going to settle down in the city?

5762
02:32:08,790 --> 02:32:09,270
Yeah.

5763
02:32:09,270 --> 02:32:12,480
I'm considering a few places
where you consider him a,

5764
02:32:12,481 --> 02:32:15,330
I'd like to move back to
San Francisco and just a,

5765
02:32:15,331 --> 02:32:15,751
you know,

5766
02:32:15,751 --> 02:32:16,584
just,

5767
02:32:16,620 --> 02:32:16,801
I mean,

5768
02:32:16,801 --> 02:32:18,150
just creating jokes.

5769
02:32:18,151 --> 02:32:18,920
That's the,

5770
02:32:18,920 --> 02:32:19,753
uh,

5771
02:32:19,760 --> 02:32:20,070
you know,

5772
02:32:20,070 --> 02:32:21,120
that's the main mission.

5773
02:32:21,260 --> 02:32:22,093
Yeah.

5774
02:32:22,440 --> 02:32:22,921
I liked it.

5775
02:32:22,921 --> 02:32:23,071
The,

5776
02:32:23,071 --> 02:32:23,281
you know,

5777
02:32:23,281 --> 02:32:25,530
the tech industry is based
out of there and I think,

5778
02:32:25,531 --> 02:32:26,310
you know,

5779
02:32:26,310 --> 02:32:26,730
uh,

5780
02:32:26,730 --> 02:32:27,630
things are moving.

5781
02:32:27,631 --> 02:32:28,800
I think that the future,

5782
02:32:28,801 --> 02:32:33,600
I mean like you can be your own
movie mogul studio now and uh,

5783
02:32:33,601 --> 02:32:33,750
I,

5784
02:32:33,750 --> 02:32:34,290
you know,

5785
02:32:34,290 --> 02:32:34,681
I don't know.

5786
02:32:34,681 --> 02:32:35,191
I think,

5787
02:32:35,191 --> 02:32:36,024
um,

5788
02:32:36,090 --> 02:32:36,923
um,

5789
02:32:36,960 --> 02:32:37,700
you know,

5790
02:32:37,700 --> 02:32:38,940
it's a lot of entertainment.

5791
02:32:39,300 --> 02:32:39,631
Yeah,

5792
02:32:39,631 --> 02:32:39,841
no,

5793
02:32:39,841 --> 02:32:40,674
there certainly is.

5794
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:41,450
I think that's too,

5795
02:32:41,450 --> 02:32:42,780
it's a great place to do stand up.

5796
02:32:42,810 --> 02:32:44,700
It's also a lot of smart people there.

5797
02:32:45,510 --> 02:32:46,470
It's a good audience.

5798
02:32:46,830 --> 02:32:47,551
When I come to La,

5799
02:32:47,551 --> 02:32:48,990
I like staying in Nice hotels,

5800
02:32:49,410 --> 02:32:49,860
you know,

5801
02:32:49,860 --> 02:32:52,020
some of that living here and paying rent.

5802
02:32:52,050 --> 02:32:52,560
I Dunno.

5803
02:32:52,560 --> 02:32:54,570
Maybe I haven't lived in
the right neighborhood.

5804
02:32:55,140 --> 02:32:56,620
Can I crash at your place
for a couple of months?

5805
02:32:58,270 --> 02:32:59,103
Sorry,

5806
02:32:59,910 --> 02:33:02,190
I'll sweep the helicopter
pad every once in a while.

5807
02:33:02,220 --> 02:33:03,660
You won't get along with the family.

5808
02:33:04,050 --> 02:33:04,360
I'm like,

5809
02:33:04,360 --> 02:33:05,193
this guy is just,

5810
02:33:05,460 --> 02:33:07,050
he's going to draw you to the dark side.

5811
02:33:07,800 --> 02:33:08,221
Don't worry.

5812
02:33:08,221 --> 02:33:09,120
My will is strong.

5813
02:33:09,210 --> 02:33:09,751
I'm kidding.

5814
02:33:09,751 --> 02:33:10,650
I uh,

5815
02:33:11,310 --> 02:33:11,641
I don't know.

5816
02:33:11,641 --> 02:33:12,181
And then also,

5817
02:33:12,181 --> 02:33:12,451
you know,

5818
02:33:12,451 --> 02:33:15,330
and then New Orleans is a
place that I would consider,

5819
02:33:15,790 --> 02:33:16,850
that's a wild sound.

5820
02:33:16,890 --> 02:33:17,490
Yeah,

5821
02:33:17,490 --> 02:33:17,821
that's a,

5822
02:33:17,821 --> 02:33:19,320
that's a free town there.

5823
02:33:19,321 --> 02:33:19,520
The,

5824
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:22,140
that's like almost like you should
have a passport to go to New Orleans.

5825
02:33:22,440 --> 02:33:26,160
It seems like some sort of Caribbean
island you just drop off into connected to

5826
02:33:26,161 --> 02:33:27,060
the rest of the country.

5827
02:33:27,390 --> 02:33:27,640
And,

5828
02:33:27,640 --> 02:33:28,350
and then again,

5829
02:33:28,350 --> 02:33:28,900
uh,

5830
02:33:28,900 --> 02:33:29,300
I,

5831
02:33:29,300 --> 02:33:30,870
I wouldn't mind moving back to,

5832
02:33:30,890 --> 02:33:32,670
to Amsterdam or Europe maybe,

5833
02:33:32,671 --> 02:33:33,060
you know,

5834
02:33:33,060 --> 02:33:33,700
get a place.

5835
02:33:33,700 --> 02:33:34,550
And Tim,

5836
02:33:34,930 --> 02:33:36,840
what about for your stand up?

5837
02:33:36,840 --> 02:33:38,310
What do you think would be the best place?

5838
02:33:38,340 --> 02:33:40,260
Do you like to have a
home club to work out of?

5839
02:33:40,320 --> 02:33:40,440
No,

5840
02:33:40,440 --> 02:33:40,740
but I,

5841
02:33:40,740 --> 02:33:40,981
you know,

5842
02:33:40,981 --> 02:33:42,330
I love the stand hope model.

5843
02:33:42,780 --> 02:33:43,141
You know,

5844
02:33:43,141 --> 02:33:46,290
he works his ass off for like two or
three months and then you'll take a month

5845
02:33:46,291 --> 02:33:46,501
off,

5846
02:33:46,501 --> 02:33:46,711
you know,

5847
02:33:46,711 --> 02:33:48,630
go home to take several
months off at times.

5848
02:33:48,770 --> 02:33:49,740
And I liked that.

5849
02:33:49,770 --> 02:33:51,240
I liked that he does that where I'm,

5850
02:33:51,660 --> 02:33:53,250
I'll only take a week or two off,

5851
02:33:53,251 --> 02:33:54,060
you know.

5852
02:33:54,060 --> 02:33:54,511
Uh,

5853
02:33:54,511 --> 02:33:55,680
I liked that notion,

5854
02:33:55,800 --> 02:33:57,450
Stan hope was doing it the perfect way.

5855
02:33:57,550 --> 02:33:58,080
Yeah.

5856
02:33:58,080 --> 02:33:58,560
He's so,

5857
02:33:58,560 --> 02:33:58,961
I mean it's so,

5858
02:33:58,961 --> 02:33:59,850
so with that in mind,

5859
02:33:59,851 --> 02:34:00,690
you could live anywhere,

5860
02:34:00,960 --> 02:34:01,480
you know,

5861
02:34:01,480 --> 02:34:01,700
you,

5862
02:34:01,700 --> 02:34:01,980
you know,

5863
02:34:01,980 --> 02:34:06,300
why not have a place in Greece or
in south of France or you know,

5864
02:34:06,330 --> 02:34:07,350
more travel time.

5865
02:34:07,710 --> 02:34:07,981
That's,

5866
02:34:07,981 --> 02:34:09,180
that's the pain of the deck.

5867
02:34:09,181 --> 02:34:13,860
And some people like to have a club
that's close that they can fuck around and

5868
02:34:13,861 --> 02:34:14,521
practice that.

5869
02:34:14,521 --> 02:34:15,930
Like when I lived in Boulder,

5870
02:34:16,260 --> 02:34:17,840
I was doing the comedy in Denver.

5871
02:34:17,880 --> 02:34:19,080
It's only like an hour and a half

5872
02:34:19,080 --> 02:34:19,621
from where I live.

5873
02:34:19,621 --> 02:34:20,221
It's pretty easy.

5874
02:34:20,221 --> 02:34:21,001
Drive down there,

5875
02:34:21,001 --> 02:34:21,750
boom,

5876
02:34:21,750 --> 02:34:22,500
do a set,

5877
02:34:22,500 --> 02:34:24,030
get right back to the wilderness,

5878
02:34:24,210 --> 02:34:24,511
you know,

5879
02:34:24,511 --> 02:34:25,850
it's like that way.

5880
02:34:25,870 --> 02:34:28,920
Get sort of the best of both
worlds type situation going on.

5881
02:34:28,921 --> 02:34:29,754
You know,

5882
02:34:30,450 --> 02:34:31,430
I think that a,

5883
02:34:31,431 --> 02:34:32,460
a home clubs.

5884
02:34:32,490 --> 02:34:32,970
Nice.

5885
02:34:32,970 --> 02:34:33,960
It's nice to have a spot.

5886
02:34:34,110 --> 02:34:36,030
So like we're standing up is on Bisbee.

5887
02:34:36,031 --> 02:34:37,050
There's no fucking club.

5888
02:34:37,260 --> 02:34:38,260
So that crazy asshole.

5889
02:34:38,310 --> 02:34:39,790
Just do a show in his back yard,

5890
02:34:41,460 --> 02:34:42,570
set up some speakers,

5891
02:34:43,020 --> 02:34:43,920
plug the Mike and

5892
02:34:45,540 --> 02:34:47,690
he did a show in Vegas
and some dude's backyard.

5893
02:34:48,170 --> 02:34:49,280
There was a guy in Vegas,

5894
02:34:49,281 --> 02:34:52,880
some kid who was hiring comedians to do
shows in his yard and have his friends

5895
02:34:52,881 --> 02:34:54,830
come over and uh,

5896
02:34:55,270 --> 02:34:56,350
it was supposed to be a great gig.

5897
02:34:56,351 --> 02:34:56,730
San Jose,

5898
02:34:56,730 --> 02:34:57,311
he say about it,

5899
02:34:57,311 --> 02:34:57,700
right?

5900
02:34:57,700 --> 02:34:58,630
Said it was awesome.

5901
02:34:59,400 --> 02:34:59,801
We got it.

5902
02:34:59,801 --> 02:35:00,070
Got It.

5903
02:35:00,070 --> 02:35:02,260
Got shut down by like city
ordinances or something.

5904
02:35:02,290 --> 02:35:02,531
Yeah,

5905
02:35:02,531 --> 02:35:03,520
he didn't have the proper permit.

5906
02:35:03,580 --> 02:35:04,630
That's a bummer.

5907
02:35:04,810 --> 02:35:05,800
What the fuck is that?

5908
02:35:06,190 --> 02:35:07,510
When would the proper permits are?

5909
02:35:08,200 --> 02:35:09,940
Well then you could shut
down lemonade stands,

5910
02:35:09,941 --> 02:35:10,290
you know,

5911
02:35:10,290 --> 02:35:10,631
so you don't,

5912
02:35:10,631 --> 02:35:11,464
and you don't have a permit.

5913
02:35:11,530 --> 02:35:11,861
Right.

5914
02:35:11,861 --> 02:35:15,700
But you don't want anybody throwing
like crazy late night parties in the

5915
02:35:15,701 --> 02:35:16,870
backyard next to you.

5916
02:35:16,900 --> 02:35:17,920
That would suck.

5917
02:35:18,670 --> 02:35:20,380
Like what if they were
playing bad rap music?

5918
02:35:20,381 --> 02:35:21,970
Like you're cool with it if it's stand up.

5919
02:35:22,360 --> 02:35:23,021
And it's funny,

5920
02:35:23,021 --> 02:35:23,780
like it's Stan Hope.

5921
02:35:23,780 --> 02:35:25,230
Do I stand out or whatever.

5922
02:35:25,250 --> 02:35:26,420
Some terrible,

5923
02:35:26,430 --> 02:35:26,860
whoo,

5924
02:35:26,860 --> 02:35:27,180
whoo,

5925
02:35:27,180 --> 02:35:27,620
whoo,

5926
02:35:27,620 --> 02:35:28,453
whoo,

5927
02:35:28,490 --> 02:35:29,540
whoo hoo.

5928
02:35:30,610 --> 02:35:30,830
Yeah.

5929
02:35:30,830 --> 02:35:31,690
Did you see?

5930
02:35:37,080 --> 02:35:39,260
He tried to get some fucking
sleep and you're like,

5931
02:35:39,261 --> 02:35:40,160
God damn it,

5932
02:35:40,161 --> 02:35:41,030
this is death.

5933
02:35:41,660 --> 02:35:43,220
Maybe that's how they
feel about Stan hope.

5934
02:35:43,221 --> 02:35:44,054
Talking about aids.

5935
02:35:44,060 --> 02:35:44,541
When I,

5936
02:35:44,541 --> 02:35:45,374
uh,

5937
02:35:45,770 --> 02:35:47,990
when I turned 16,

5938
02:35:48,440 --> 02:35:53,440
my parents made the tactical error of
going out of town that weekend and I threw

5939
02:35:53,991 --> 02:35:58,190
one of the biggest parties Oviedo high
school had ever seen and there were just

5940
02:35:58,310 --> 02:36:02,900
cars parked all down the block and
just massive party and people just,

5941
02:36:03,290 --> 02:36:04,123
you know,

5942
02:36:04,190 --> 02:36:04,920
drinking on,

5943
02:36:04,920 --> 02:36:05,070
I,

5944
02:36:05,070 --> 02:36:06,480
I was uh,

5945
02:36:06,920 --> 02:36:09,830
talking to like three of the
hottest girls in my school,

5946
02:36:10,070 --> 02:36:15,070
in our living room and
this guy vomits on the,

5947
02:36:15,490 --> 02:36:16,400
on our living room,

5948
02:36:16,401 --> 02:36:16,851
carpet.

5949
02:36:16,851 --> 02:36:17,331
You know what I mean?

5950
02:36:17,331 --> 02:36:17,750
What am I do?

5951
02:36:17,750 --> 02:36:19,820
I'm going to get down
on my hands and knees,

5952
02:36:20,380 --> 02:36:20,720
you know,

5953
02:36:20,720 --> 02:36:22,260
in the middle of this party or that,

5954
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:23,550
these girls that I,

5955
02:36:23,551 --> 02:36:24,980
I care about,

5956
02:36:25,040 --> 02:36:25,551
uh,

5957
02:36:25,551 --> 02:36:25,791
you know,

5958
02:36:25,791 --> 02:36:27,080
watch me cleaned some vomit.

5959
02:36:27,340 --> 02:36:28,173
Ha.

5960
02:36:28,390 --> 02:36:29,180
So what'd you do?

5961
02:36:29,180 --> 02:36:31,290
He sprinkled some dog food on
it and let the dog in that?

5962
02:36:31,430 --> 02:36:32,580
No.

5963
02:36:32,600 --> 02:36:33,433
Did you really?

5964
02:36:33,980 --> 02:36:34,431
Oh,

5965
02:36:34,431 --> 02:36:37,220
you fucking foul human being.

5966
02:36:37,910 --> 02:36:40,050
Why would you want to
dog me drinking diet?

5967
02:36:40,880 --> 02:36:45,880
It was a the cleanest carpet area
that dog haunted you with dog farts.

5968
02:36:48,320 --> 02:36:49,153
Poor dog.

5969
02:36:51,010 --> 02:36:53,180
Come on ripping horrible farts.

5970
02:36:53,500 --> 02:36:54,600
Bio farts.

5971
02:36:56,600 --> 02:36:57,650
Worst here.

5972
02:36:57,860 --> 02:36:58,760
Your dog's Fart.

5973
02:36:59,160 --> 02:37:00,470
When you look over it and be like,

5974
02:37:00,471 --> 02:37:01,370
come on man,

5975
02:37:01,371 --> 02:37:02,204
for real.

5976
02:37:02,330 --> 02:37:02,451
Hey,

5977
02:37:02,451 --> 02:37:04,010
that's when the dog is
comfortable with you.

5978
02:37:04,400 --> 02:37:05,990
They're always comfortable with your man.

5979
02:37:06,050 --> 02:37:07,280
They never hold in farts.

5980
02:37:07,720 --> 02:37:08,750
I was just something about dogs.

5981
02:37:08,751 --> 02:37:09,730
They never figured it out.

5982
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:10,760
You yell at them when they farm.

5983
02:37:10,790 --> 02:37:13,820
They never put two and two together like
what the fuck are you yelling at him,

5984
02:37:13,821 --> 02:37:14,570
man,

5985
02:37:14,570 --> 02:37:16,450
I'm just here doing my steak.

5986
02:37:16,760 --> 02:37:17,551
I'm just being mad.

5987
02:37:17,551 --> 02:37:18,440
I didn't even move

5988
02:37:19,060 --> 02:37:20,740
fucking stinky bitch.

5989
02:37:22,840 --> 02:37:25,060
You ever have a dog
wake you up with a fart?

5990
02:37:26,320 --> 02:37:27,910
My dogs used to Fart so bad.

5991
02:37:27,940 --> 02:37:28,760
I'd be in bed.

5992
02:37:28,760 --> 02:37:29,270
I'm black.

5993
02:37:29,270 --> 02:37:30,140
Oh God.

5994
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:31,310
What the fuck?

5995
02:37:31,311 --> 02:37:33,650
It was like I was eating shit in bed.

5996
02:37:34,300 --> 02:37:35,133
No,

5997
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:36,830
especially if you feed them wet food.

5998
02:37:36,920 --> 02:37:37,753
That's the key.

5999
02:37:37,910 --> 02:37:39,130
Dogs love that wet food.

6000
02:37:39,131 --> 02:37:44,131
But that wet food would just just
all gels together and stomach and the

6001
02:37:44,211 --> 02:37:46,730
fermentation process and
then when it comes out,

6002
02:37:46,731 --> 02:37:47,564
just,

6003
02:37:47,720 --> 02:37:48,650
Oh,

6004
02:37:48,651 --> 02:37:49,250
you're just,

6005
02:37:49,250 --> 02:37:49,881
you feel it.

6006
02:37:49,881 --> 02:37:50,301
You feel it.

6007
02:37:50,301 --> 02:37:51,170
Before you even smell it.

6008
02:37:52,330 --> 02:37:52,720
Oh my God,

6009
02:37:52,720 --> 02:37:53,553
we got this subject.

6010
02:37:54,150 --> 02:37:54,470
What?

6011
02:37:54,470 --> 02:37:55,400
Doug Fir forest,

6012
02:37:56,110 --> 02:37:56,781
if you like dogs,

6013
02:37:56,781 --> 02:37:57,614
you got to deal with that.

6014
02:37:57,770 --> 02:37:59,780
It's a weird thing that we
have certain animals that we,

6015
02:37:59,781 --> 02:38:00,090
we,

6016
02:38:00,090 --> 02:38:02,600
we cherish and certain
animals that we just,

6017
02:38:02,660 --> 02:38:03,020
you know,

6018
02:38:03,020 --> 02:38:06,470
we slaughter on a regular basis
and they're clearly defined.

6019
02:38:06,680 --> 02:38:08,420
And when we step outside of those lines,

6020
02:38:08,421 --> 02:38:09,410
people get really upset.

6021
02:38:09,830 --> 02:38:13,400
I was watching this
thing on TV where they,

6022
02:38:13,401 --> 02:38:13,790
uh,

6023
02:38:13,790 --> 02:38:14,623
it was in the,

6024
02:38:15,020 --> 02:38:16,730
one of the British papers,

6025
02:38:17,090 --> 02:38:18,560
they were showing these this,

6026
02:38:18,561 --> 02:38:21,140
the latest trend is can the lion hunts.

6027
02:38:21,670 --> 02:38:21,851
Oh,

6028
02:38:21,851 --> 02:38:23,320
I just saw that on the Guardian.

6029
02:38:23,740 --> 02:38:24,191
The Guardian.

6030
02:38:24,191 --> 02:38:24,551
That's what it was.

6031
02:38:24,551 --> 02:38:24,790
Yeah.

6032
02:38:24,790 --> 02:38:25,510
I love the Guardian.

6033
02:38:25,510 --> 02:38:25,721
Yeah.

6034
02:38:25,721 --> 02:38:26,860
It's really crazy.

6035
02:38:26,861 --> 02:38:28,000
If you haven't seen it,

6036
02:38:28,030 --> 02:38:30,100
the raise these ends discuss,

6037
02:38:30,610 --> 02:38:31,150
did you see that?

6038
02:38:31,150 --> 02:38:34,090
It was on today's in today's
go guardian on their website,

6039
02:38:34,120 --> 02:38:34,840
us.

6040
02:38:34,840 --> 02:38:37,690
And it was this beautiful lion,

6041
02:38:38,180 --> 02:38:39,340
just massive line.

6042
02:38:39,341 --> 02:38:40,121
And the guy standing there,

6043
02:38:40,121 --> 02:38:40,330
we're like,

6044
02:38:40,330 --> 02:38:40,421
oh,

6045
02:38:40,421 --> 02:38:42,220
this is right Baltic underneath it.

6046
02:38:42,310 --> 02:38:42,960
Yeah.

6047
02:38:42,960 --> 02:38:44,740
Well what's really crazy is this,

6048
02:38:44,741 --> 02:38:47,680
is this not even a wild lion
that's inside of a fence.

6049
02:38:47,860 --> 02:38:49,660
These are hand raised lions.

6050
02:38:49,990 --> 02:38:52,140
So what they do is they
take them from their mother,

6051
02:38:52,141 --> 02:38:53,290
like right away,

6052
02:38:53,470 --> 02:38:55,510
all they see is people,

6053
02:38:55,600 --> 02:38:59,230
they see lion cubs and people and the
people provide them food and the people

6054
02:38:59,231 --> 02:39:00,010
pet them.

6055
02:39:00,010 --> 02:39:02,710
So that's how you train these
lines to be more docile.

6056
02:39:02,830 --> 02:39:06,850
So that's how when people were
wandering around shooting these lines,

6057
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:10,690
these lines aren't stalking them and
killing them because these lions associate

6058
02:39:10,691 --> 02:39:12,850
people with being like their parents.

6059
02:39:13,270 --> 02:39:16,630
So this is like one of the weirdest,

6060
02:39:16,690 --> 02:39:21,690
strangest sort of canned hunts ever
because it's like shooting big dogs.

6061
02:39:22,630 --> 02:39:24,240
It's really similar shit.

6062
02:39:24,250 --> 02:39:25,300
What's the sport in that?

6063
02:39:25,780 --> 02:39:29,440
If you see how these lions are
with the people that are in this,

6064
02:39:29,441 --> 02:39:29,681
uh,

6065
02:39:29,681 --> 02:39:30,401
this park,

6066
02:39:30,401 --> 02:39:32,290
before they send them to this park,

6067
02:39:32,440 --> 02:39:37,060
there's another company that's a farm
that grows these lions and they take them

6068
02:39:37,061 --> 02:39:40,270
away from their mom and then they feed
them with bottles and they're cuddling

6069
02:39:40,271 --> 02:39:41,104
with him and shit.

6070
02:39:41,200 --> 02:39:42,460
And then when they get full grown,

6071
02:39:42,461 --> 02:39:46,150
then they let him loose in this park
and it's just this big giant fenced in

6072
02:39:46,151 --> 02:39:46,870
place.

6073
02:39:46,870 --> 02:39:50,170
And the lions are walking around and
then they let loose the white people.

6074
02:39:50,350 --> 02:39:53,470
And then the white people come in with
these guns and they set up and there's

6075
02:39:53,471 --> 02:39:54,610
like four or five guys,

6076
02:39:54,611 --> 02:39:59,020
Shit went the lions because the lion
makes it charge when you shoot them,

6077
02:39:59,021 --> 02:39:59,681
if you heard them,

6078
02:39:59,681 --> 02:40:00,820
they'll fucking charge at you.

6079
02:40:00,820 --> 02:40:01,810
They know what happened.

6080
02:40:02,170 --> 02:40:05,310
And so you got to like have like four
or five dudes at the same time shooting.

6081
02:40:05,860 --> 02:40:06,660
So watch this,

6082
02:40:06,660 --> 02:40:08,560
like the lines just
sitting there chilling.

6083
02:40:08,590 --> 02:40:09,250
Oh yeah they do.

6084
02:40:09,250 --> 02:40:09,761
I'll look.

6085
02:40:09,761 --> 02:40:13,860
So he shot at him and missed the
line of what the fuck's going on.

6086
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:15,900
The line doesn't recognize
it as a threat at all.

6087
02:40:15,901 --> 02:40:16,770
And then now he hit him.

6088
02:40:17,190 --> 02:40:20,520
Now the lions running at them and then
they dropped the camera cause they the

6089
02:40:20,521 --> 02:40:21,600
line hit with a bullet.

6090
02:40:21,630 --> 02:40:21,871
Okay,

6091
02:40:21,871 --> 02:40:24,210
it's dying but it's running at them.

6092
02:40:24,211 --> 02:40:27,750
So they just started firing at
it as it's running fat white men.

6093
02:40:28,020 --> 02:40:30,120
Well this is so crazy because this is Gus.

6094
02:40:30,121 --> 02:40:33,720
This is not even something
that you would eat for food.

6095
02:40:33,960 --> 02:40:37,710
And they're pretending that
this is the dangerous game.

6096
02:40:37,740 --> 02:40:39,450
They pretending that this is the,

6097
02:40:39,470 --> 02:40:43,620
they're the great white hunter and
they're out there taking down a lie in and

6098
02:40:43,621 --> 02:40:45,030
then they have it in their home.

6099
02:40:45,031 --> 02:40:45,271
Look,

6100
02:40:45,271 --> 02:40:48,240
this is a lion I shot
while I was in Africa,

6101
02:40:48,660 --> 02:40:49,950
but really they've done,

6102
02:40:49,980 --> 02:40:52,080
they've taken the balls
out of the lion hunt.

6103
02:40:52,120 --> 02:40:52,860
Dang.

6104
02:40:52,860 --> 02:40:53,281
Right.

6105
02:40:53,281 --> 02:40:53,610
See Look,

6106
02:40:53,610 --> 02:40:54,960
there's four guys with rifles.

6107
02:40:54,961 --> 02:40:55,440
Yeah,

6108
02:40:55,440 --> 02:40:56,580
I remember I went to,

6109
02:40:56,581 --> 02:41:00,030
I was in Savia Spain and uh,

6110
02:41:00,031 --> 02:41:00,960
I went to the bull fights.

6111
02:41:00,961 --> 02:41:01,920
I had seen it once in,

6112
02:41:01,921 --> 02:41:04,290
in Mexico and it was
one dude versus a bowl,

6113
02:41:04,291 --> 02:41:05,124
you know,

6114
02:41:05,150 --> 02:41:05,460
uh,

6115
02:41:05,460 --> 02:41:07,500
I had read Hemingway's
death in the afternoon,

6116
02:41:08,090 --> 02:41:08,923
you know,

6117
02:41:08,970 --> 02:41:09,803
manly.

6118
02:41:09,840 --> 02:41:12,150
It was like the minor
leagues of bull fighting.

6119
02:41:12,570 --> 02:41:14,400
There was four guys against one bull.

6120
02:41:14,430 --> 02:41:18,450
One guy goes out there with the Red Cape
and then another dude sneaks up behind

6121
02:41:18,451 --> 02:41:20,220
it with the prongs and sticks it in it.

6122
02:41:20,490 --> 02:41:21,420
And I got upset.

6123
02:41:21,510 --> 02:41:25,380
It was like the most cowardly chicken
shit stuff I'd ever seen in my life.

6124
02:41:25,381 --> 02:41:27,360
And that's what that
lion thing reminds me.

6125
02:41:27,361 --> 02:41:30,690
I would like really for guys with rifles

6126
02:41:30,840 --> 02:41:31,830
isn't those things.

6127
02:41:31,831 --> 02:41:32,940
They Jab in the bowl,

6128
02:41:32,941 --> 02:41:34,260
aren't they poisoned as well?

6129
02:41:34,690 --> 02:41:35,560
Hm.

6130
02:41:36,030 --> 02:41:36,481
I Dunno.

6131
02:41:36,481 --> 02:41:36,991
I didn't think so.

6132
02:41:36,991 --> 02:41:37,201
I thought,

6133
02:41:37,201 --> 02:41:38,100
oh they poison Brian.

6134
02:41:38,101 --> 02:41:41,090
You know what time those things that
jab and a bowl during a bull fighting it

6135
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:41,410
aren't.

6136
02:41:41,410 --> 02:41:42,780
They may have poison in them.

6137
02:41:42,810 --> 02:41:43,080
No,

6138
02:41:43,080 --> 02:41:43,620
I don't know.

6139
02:41:43,620 --> 02:41:44,340
I'm touring.

6140
02:41:44,340 --> 02:41:45,001
I think they do,

6141
02:41:45,001 --> 02:41:46,140
but either way they're stabbing.

6142
02:41:46,150 --> 02:41:46,480
I'm,

6143
02:41:46,480 --> 02:41:46,711
you know,

6144
02:41:46,711 --> 02:41:47,460
fucking him up.

6145
02:41:47,460 --> 02:41:48,293
He's hurt bad.

6146
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:49,633
Yeah.

6147
02:41:49,710 --> 02:41:50,441
It's that,

6148
02:41:50,441 --> 02:41:51,200
that line thing

6149
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:51,860
disturbing.

6150
02:41:51,860 --> 02:41:52,790
It's really disturbing,

6151
02:41:52,820 --> 02:41:54,620
which just shows how weak people are.

6152
02:41:54,650 --> 02:41:57,800
It's just such a weird thing to want to
show you that everything is for sale.

6153
02:41:58,410 --> 02:42:00,020
You can have any experience you want.

6154
02:42:00,021 --> 02:42:01,720
If you're really flush.

6155
02:42:01,980 --> 02:42:03,820
They've appealed to the weakest of,

6156
02:42:03,890 --> 02:42:04,723
of people.

6157
02:42:04,930 --> 02:42:05,240
You know,

6158
02:42:05,240 --> 02:42:08,030
the people that would want to go there
just to shoot something and say they shot

6159
02:42:08,031 --> 02:42:08,240
it in.

6160
02:42:08,240 --> 02:42:09,740
So you're shooting a pet.

6161
02:42:09,920 --> 02:42:13,060
I mean essentially that's a pet
that's been let loose and this,

6162
02:42:13,150 --> 02:42:16,460
the fact that they're trying to look at
this little hot dog is licking a lion,

6163
02:42:17,430 --> 02:42:17,930
you know?

6164
02:42:17,930 --> 02:42:18,231
Oh,

6165
02:42:18,231 --> 02:42:19,220
that's adorable.

6166
02:42:20,570 --> 02:42:21,403
That's adorable.

6167
02:42:21,860 --> 02:42:22,161
You know,

6168
02:42:22,161 --> 02:42:22,430
like,

6169
02:42:22,430 --> 02:42:24,810
like that line clearly
is not a fucking day.

6170
02:42:24,840 --> 02:42:25,790
I mean if you went,

6171
02:42:27,150 --> 02:42:30,100
if you went to his case will probably
fuck your world up if you want it.

6172
02:42:30,101 --> 02:42:30,360
And you know,

6173
02:42:30,360 --> 02:42:31,670
the man lion,

6174
02:42:31,730 --> 02:42:32,210
uh,

6175
02:42:32,210 --> 02:42:33,021
it's pretty lazy.

6176
02:42:33,021 --> 02:42:34,660
It's just lie around
and fuck all the time.

6177
02:42:34,670 --> 02:42:36,050
The woman lion does all the hunting,

6178
02:42:36,051 --> 02:42:36,470
right?

6179
02:42:36,470 --> 02:42:36,621
Yeah.

6180
02:42:36,621 --> 02:42:37,580
If he's well fed,

6181
02:42:37,760 --> 02:42:39,860
the male lion is there to defend,

6182
02:42:40,220 --> 02:42:42,170
to make sure that he protects the,

6183
02:42:42,171 --> 02:42:42,291
uh,

6184
02:42:42,291 --> 02:42:47,030
the females and the cubs against other
males that will come in and try to rough

6185
02:42:47,031 --> 02:42:48,650
everybody up and eat all the babies.

6186
02:42:49,400 --> 02:42:50,233
That's a,

6187
02:42:50,540 --> 02:42:52,640
when a new male comes in the big mail,

6188
02:42:52,641 --> 02:42:55,580
it has to be able to keep that mail
out because if that mail gets in,

6189
02:42:55,850 --> 02:42:57,830
it's very likely he's
going to kill all the cubs.

6190
02:42:57,831 --> 02:42:58,700
If they're not his,

6191
02:42:59,210 --> 02:43:00,170
he'll just dominate,

6192
02:43:00,171 --> 02:43:00,711
takeover,

6193
02:43:00,711 --> 02:43:02,930
start fucking all these checks
again and kill their babies.

6194
02:43:03,320 --> 02:43:05,060
So that's what the male is supposed to do.

6195
02:43:05,120 --> 02:43:05,321
Wait,

6196
02:43:05,321 --> 02:43:08,360
I'm supposed to just take care of
everything and fight off hyenas.

6197
02:43:10,070 --> 02:43:11,010
There you got lions.

6198
02:43:12,990 --> 02:43:13,823
Just sad.

6199
02:43:14,260 --> 02:43:15,670
It's edutainment.

6200
02:43:15,940 --> 02:43:17,560
It's sad that people
would want to do that.

6201
02:43:17,630 --> 02:43:21,400
They would actually want to go and shoot
some something that's basically a pat

6202
02:43:21,950 --> 02:43:23,530
and in this fenced in area,

6203
02:43:23,980 --> 02:43:24,550
you know,

6204
02:43:24,550 --> 02:43:25,030
we've,

6205
02:43:25,030 --> 02:43:29,020
we've talked about a Ted Nugent on the
show before Ted Nugent has a show called

6206
02:43:29,021 --> 02:43:30,010
the spirit of the wild.

6207
02:43:30,370 --> 02:43:31,390
It's kind of fascinating.

6208
02:43:31,690 --> 02:43:32,170
Um,

6209
02:43:32,170 --> 02:43:33,010
and he has a,

6210
02:43:33,040 --> 02:43:33,821
these ranches,

6211
02:43:33,821 --> 02:43:34,301
two of them,

6212
02:43:34,301 --> 02:43:38,200
one up in Minnesota and one in Texas
with his offense din ranch with all these

6213
02:43:38,201 --> 02:43:39,160
deer running around on it.

6214
02:43:39,161 --> 02:43:42,850
And he sits up in a tree and he puts
food out and the deer walk up to the food

6215
02:43:42,851 --> 02:43:44,230
and it sticks.

6216
02:43:44,231 --> 02:43:45,080
And with a bow and Arrow,

6217
02:43:45,081 --> 02:43:45,670
his bow.

6218
02:43:45,670 --> 02:43:45,910
Yeah,

6219
02:43:45,910 --> 02:43:47,320
but he eats all the meat.

6220
02:43:47,410 --> 02:43:47,591
I mean,

6221
02:43:47,591 --> 02:43:48,520
that's all he eats.

6222
02:43:48,550 --> 02:43:50,170
And he enjoys doing it and you know,

6223
02:43:50,171 --> 02:43:51,240
it's all his property,

6224
02:43:51,250 --> 02:43:51,550
Jeremy,

6225
02:43:51,550 --> 02:43:52,780
it makes you very flatulent.

6226
02:43:52,870 --> 02:43:53,810
So He's a [inaudible].

6227
02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:54,280
He said,

6228
02:43:54,280 --> 02:43:56,650
what'd you hear that I
haven't you ever had venison?

6229
02:43:56,710 --> 02:43:56,951
Yeah.

6230
02:43:56,951 --> 02:43:57,551
Half Lights.

6231
02:43:57,551 --> 02:43:58,384
The buddle hold up.

6232
02:43:58,570 --> 02:43:58,990
Hmm.

6233
02:43:58,990 --> 02:43:59,980
Maybe that's a personal thing.

6234
02:44:02,010 --> 02:44:04,560
I reveal too much about what
makes me flatulence milk.

6235
02:44:04,810 --> 02:44:05,680
No ice cream,

6236
02:44:05,740 --> 02:44:07,810
ice cream and have horrible farts.

6237
02:44:08,210 --> 02:44:08,930
Did,

6238
02:44:08,930 --> 02:44:09,763
uh,

6239
02:44:09,770 --> 02:44:12,750
what was it politically incorrect when
it was on comedy central years ago?

6240
02:44:12,780 --> 02:44:13,390
Yeah.

6241
02:44:13,390 --> 02:44:14,510
When Bill Maher was first,

6242
02:44:14,511 --> 02:44:15,170
you know,

6243
02:44:15,170 --> 02:44:18,140
this first version of
his show with Ted Nugent.

6244
02:44:19,490 --> 02:44:21,080
So nobody got in an edge,

6245
02:44:21,140 --> 02:44:21,540
a word,

6246
02:44:21,540 --> 02:44:21,901
a word,

6247
02:44:21,901 --> 02:44:22,311
edgewise,

6248
02:44:22,311 --> 02:44:23,210
because he's just,

6249
02:44:23,480 --> 02:44:25,070
he just dominated the ball.

6250
02:44:25,130 --> 02:44:25,550
Yeah.

6251
02:44:25,550 --> 02:44:30,170
And afterwards we're in the green room
and he comes up to me and he puts his arm

6252
02:44:30,171 --> 02:44:30,561
around me.

6253
02:44:30,561 --> 02:44:31,394
It's time,

6254
02:44:31,590 --> 02:44:32,423
uh,

6255
02:44:32,480 --> 02:44:33,440
I like you man.

6256
02:44:33,441 --> 02:44:33,840
And,

6257
02:44:33,840 --> 02:44:34,370
uh,

6258
02:44:34,370 --> 02:44:38,060
I want you to cause it
to have my magazine.

6259
02:44:38,061 --> 02:44:38,590
And he had,

6260
02:44:38,590 --> 02:44:40,270
he's got the magazine in his left hand.

6261
02:44:40,290 --> 02:44:42,200
He's got his right arm
around me and it's called,

6262
02:44:42,480 --> 02:44:42,941
it's,

6263
02:44:42,941 --> 02:44:43,251
it's,

6264
02:44:43,251 --> 02:44:43,551
it's,

6265
02:44:43,551 --> 02:44:43,700
uh,

6266
02:44:43,700 --> 02:44:45,380
Ted Nugent's bowhunting magazine.

6267
02:44:45,381 --> 02:44:45,630
He goes,

6268
02:44:45,630 --> 02:44:46,463
no time.

6269
02:44:46,700 --> 02:44:49,060
This magazine is more than about bow hunt.

6270
02:44:49,640 --> 02:44:54,640
This is about you and who you are as a
man and getting in touch with your inner

6271
02:44:54,651 --> 02:44:55,484
being.

6272
02:44:56,480 --> 02:44:57,850
I read the fucking magazines

6273
02:44:59,510 --> 02:45:00,343
cover to cover.

6274
02:45:00,920 --> 02:45:01,753
It was about bowling.

6275
02:45:04,280 --> 02:45:05,590
It had nothing to do with me.

6276
02:45:05,740 --> 02:45:05,891
Well,

6277
02:45:05,891 --> 02:45:06,460
let's see him.

6278
02:45:06,460 --> 02:45:08,020
That's what bowhunting is about.

6279
02:45:08,050 --> 02:45:10,450
Bow Hunting is about some spiritual quest,

6280
02:45:10,560 --> 02:45:11,360
you know,

6281
02:45:11,360 --> 02:45:13,480
to tap into the essence of the wall,

6282
02:45:13,510 --> 02:45:14,231
the wilderness.

6283
02:45:14,231 --> 02:45:15,064
Right.

6284
02:45:15,110 --> 02:45:16,090
He does it with an Arrow.

6285
02:45:16,091 --> 02:45:16,780
That's Kinda,

6286
02:45:16,780 --> 02:45:17,830
that's old school.

6287
02:45:18,190 --> 02:45:19,023
Well it is.

6288
02:45:19,480 --> 02:45:20,081
He's a,

6289
02:45:20,081 --> 02:45:20,231
I mean,

6290
02:45:20,231 --> 02:45:22,060
he's really good at what does that song,

6291
02:45:23,260 --> 02:45:23,501
oh,

6292
02:45:23,501 --> 02:45:23,981
that's right.

6293
02:45:23,981 --> 02:45:25,150
Why must we eat the animals?

6294
02:45:25,580 --> 02:45:26,410
But that's right.

6295
02:45:26,410 --> 02:45:27,880
This is a real video,

6296
02:45:28,060 --> 02:45:28,893
by the way.

6297
02:45:29,320 --> 02:45:33,730
This is a white guy and
this is a Vegan reggae song.

6298
02:45:33,760 --> 02:45:34,160
Oh Wow.

6299
02:45:34,160 --> 02:45:38,510
And if this doesn't make you both
laugh and want to get violent.

6300
02:45:38,520 --> 02:45:39,353
Yes.

6301
02:45:41,830 --> 02:45:43,820
The beans up this way.

6302
02:45:45,440 --> 02:45:50,110
The animals have language amenities
that you got to see their videos to

6303
02:45:53,610 --> 02:45:57,490
is off for cultivation or human bias.

6304
02:46:07,750 --> 02:46:10,350
Look at how fucking this is.

6305
02:46:11,160 --> 02:46:12,810
Why must we eat the animals?

6306
02:46:19,410 --> 02:46:20,240
When I was in this,

6307
02:46:20,240 --> 02:46:21,150
when I was in New Zealand,

6308
02:46:21,450 --> 02:46:23,100
there was a billboard for something.

6309
02:46:23,101 --> 02:46:25,320
I don't know if it was a
restaurant or something,

6310
02:46:25,321 --> 02:46:26,310
but it's at a,

6311
02:46:26,550 --> 02:46:27,810
if it didn't have a mother,

6312
02:46:28,620 --> 02:46:29,770
it doesn't go on our grill.

6313
02:46:33,390 --> 02:46:35,010
They won't even cook beans.

6314
02:46:38,430 --> 02:46:40,130
They won't even grill Zucchini.

6315
02:46:40,150 --> 02:46:43,080
Get the fuck Outta here
with this guy's hilarious.

6316
02:46:43,530 --> 02:46:47,250
And he's showing like things in this
video that people don't eat like big

6317
02:46:48,400 --> 02:46:49,210
whales.

6318
02:46:49,210 --> 02:46:53,790
What's your rough Japanese people do hunt
the whales and he's like the cow here.

6319
02:46:53,970 --> 02:46:54,780
You know,

6320
02:46:54,780 --> 02:46:57,180
here's the real problem
with this philosophy.

6321
02:46:58,530 --> 02:46:59,910
If you really did that,

6322
02:46:59,940 --> 02:47:02,460
do you know how many people would
get sick from poor nutrition?

6323
02:47:02,490 --> 02:47:03,300
First of all,

6324
02:47:03,300 --> 02:47:03,961
they already are,

6325
02:47:03,961 --> 02:47:04,231
right?

6326
02:47:04,231 --> 02:47:05,130
So that's a bad argument.

6327
02:47:05,310 --> 02:47:08,820
But the real issue is what are you
going to do with all these animals now?

6328
02:47:08,910 --> 02:47:09,960
Cause if you're not killing them,

6329
02:47:09,961 --> 02:47:12,720
you better introduce some predators into
the food chain because otherwise you're

6330
02:47:12,721 --> 02:47:13,950
going to have deer everywhere.

6331
02:47:13,951 --> 02:47:15,150
You weren't gonna be able to drive.

6332
02:47:15,390 --> 02:47:15,781
You're not going to,

6333
02:47:15,781 --> 02:47:17,100
your cows are going to be all over it.

6334
02:47:17,101 --> 02:47:18,150
You're gonna keep him from fucking,

6335
02:47:18,151 --> 02:47:19,200
you're going to castrate them.

6336
02:47:19,201 --> 02:47:20,190
You gonna what are you going to do?

6337
02:47:20,220 --> 02:47:20,640
How are you gonna?

6338
02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:21,570
How are you going to neuter them?

6339
02:47:21,710 --> 02:47:23,040
How you get to manage the population?

6340
02:47:23,041 --> 02:47:24,120
Are you going to kill a few?

6341
02:47:24,390 --> 02:47:25,051
What do you do then?

6342
02:47:25,051 --> 02:47:25,890
And no need to meet?

6343
02:47:25,920 --> 02:47:28,190
That seems pretty ridiculous when people
are starving in the world and your

6344
02:47:28,200 --> 02:47:31,470
ships and shipping and boxes of
fresh vegetables that are rotting.

6345
02:47:31,770 --> 02:47:32,750
My favorite sandwiches,

6346
02:47:32,790 --> 02:47:33,623
the BLT,

6347
02:47:33,950 --> 02:47:34,411
it's great.

6348
02:47:34,411 --> 02:47:34,741
Sam,

6349
02:47:34,741 --> 02:47:35,574
how are you going to,

6350
02:47:35,700 --> 02:47:36,690
how are you going to in sandwich?

6351
02:47:36,730 --> 02:47:37,740
You can take away bacon

6352
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:38,281
dude.

6353
02:47:38,281 --> 02:47:39,540
I been eating the fuck out of Bacon.

6354
02:47:39,541 --> 02:47:41,130
Lightly big is good for you.

6355
02:47:41,150 --> 02:47:42,110
I went back to Baygon.

6356
02:47:42,290 --> 02:47:43,123
Fuck yeah you did.

6357
02:47:43,150 --> 02:47:43,983
I said I had like,

6358
02:47:44,120 --> 02:47:45,740
my father was a baker and his stories,

6359
02:47:47,050 --> 02:47:50,120
I like started getting
Turkey Bacon and I was like,

6360
02:47:50,121 --> 02:47:50,211
oh,

6361
02:47:50,211 --> 02:47:51,890
this tastes good enough man.

6362
02:47:51,891 --> 02:47:52,724
Fuck that.

6363
02:47:52,980 --> 02:47:56,720
Good fat bacon like re
like freshly sliced bacon.

6364
02:47:56,721 --> 02:47:57,554
Not like the,

6365
02:47:57,580 --> 02:48:01,090
the Oscar Meyer packs that
you can buy your hard core.

6366
02:48:01,150 --> 02:48:01,740
Your uh,

6367
02:48:01,740 --> 02:48:01,940
yeah.

6368
02:48:01,940 --> 02:48:03,720
You're the boars head at the Deli.

6369
02:48:04,460 --> 02:48:05,330
You get that Bacon.

6370
02:48:06,390 --> 02:48:08,980
Do you ever get the bacon
they have at the um,

6371
02:48:09,070 --> 02:48:09,820
at whole foods?

6372
02:48:09,820 --> 02:48:10,330
Yes.

6373
02:48:10,330 --> 02:48:12,040
Oh yeah.

6374
02:48:12,190 --> 02:48:13,060
You cannot bacon.

6375
02:48:13,120 --> 02:48:14,620
You gotta go Rob Wolf style though.

6376
02:48:14,621 --> 02:48:14,781
Dude.

6377
02:48:14,781 --> 02:48:15,910
You get a cook it slow.

6378
02:48:16,070 --> 02:48:18,100
You got to get a big frying
pan and cook it slow.

6379
02:48:18,190 --> 02:48:20,110
He doesn't unlike some electrical Jamey,

6380
02:48:20,111 --> 02:48:22,300
but he cooks his bacon
for like three hours.

6381
02:48:22,950 --> 02:48:23,290
Yeah.

6382
02:48:23,290 --> 02:48:24,760
But when you do it that way,

6383
02:48:24,850 --> 02:48:28,600
like if you ever go to like a four seasons
and you eat at the buffet and he get

6384
02:48:28,601 --> 02:48:29,141
that Bacon,

6385
02:48:29,141 --> 02:48:29,321
you're like,

6386
02:48:29,321 --> 02:48:29,591
hell no.

6387
02:48:29,591 --> 02:48:30,580
Fuck are they doing this?

6388
02:48:30,581 --> 02:48:32,260
Cause my bacon is always fucked up.

6389
02:48:32,380 --> 02:48:33,820
Twisted black.

6390
02:48:33,880 --> 02:48:38,880
They're baking is like consistent and
Perri a rich brown and it's so perfect.

6391
02:48:39,490 --> 02:48:41,730
It's cause they're slow
cook in that batch,

6392
02:48:43,170 --> 02:48:44,200
cooking that pitch.

6393
02:48:44,740 --> 02:48:45,700
Let me go get some bacon right now.

6394
02:48:45,960 --> 02:48:46,990

02:48:52,671 --> 02:48:53,130
