1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,250
What do you think about this fight card?

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,170
Got a Fox fight tomorrow night.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,430
We're going to come back and watch the
fights after I kill a monster buck.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,620
It's on the books folks in the cards.

6
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:14,454
I'm making a prediction.

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:15,121
Uh,

8
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:15,930
it's a big fight.

9
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,430
The main event is huge.

10
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,621
It's high failed.

11
00:00:18,621 --> 00:00:23,621
Dos Anjos is the former UFC lightweight
champ versus Tony Ferguson who is

12
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,750
undoubtedly without question one of
the best lightweights in the world.

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,650
And the guys have been knocking on
the door to a title shot for a while.

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,160
It's a really interesting fight because
it highlights a real issue with MMA

15
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:35,994
right now.

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,510
Uh,

17
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,860
and that issues weight cutting.

18
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:38,800
I failed.

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:38,960
Oh,

20
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,820
Sandra's had a terrible weight
cut for the Eddie Alvarez fight.

21
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,180
I'm hearing a lot of
like conflicting stories,

22
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,160
but all of them really bad.

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,870
Now I shouldn't say conflicting,

24
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,240
I should say a different stories,

25
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:55,590
but of what went on when he was making
wait for his fight with Eddie Alvarez.

26
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,780
And apparently he was in bad shape,

27
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,160
like really bad shape,

28
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:01,530
like barely made wait for that.

29
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,431
And was,

30
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:02,850
you know,

31
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,050
just really in physical discomfort.

32
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:09,990
And pain and just all screwed
up from that weight cut.

33
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,380
I think weight cutting is one of
the worst aspects of fighting.

34
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,830
I think it might be worse
than the beatings he's guys
take [inaudible] we don't

35
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:17,820
see it visually.

36
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:19,380
You don't see cuts in their face.

37
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,940
We don't see knock outs,

38
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:24,030
we don't see blood when
they're cutting weight.

39
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:27,180
So we don't think of it as the same kind
of damage that we do from a beating.

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,970
But I think it might
be as bad if not worse.

41
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,470
I would say worse.

42
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,060
It could very well be.

43
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,800
And then even more worse is the fact
these guys are dehydrating themselves

44
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:42,801
literally to death's door and then
fighting trained killers 24 hours later.

45
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,520
It's unavoidable.

46
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,810
It's unnecessary.

47
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,070
I mean it's not unavoidable.

48
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:48,000
It's avoidable.

49
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,580
It's unnecessary and it's foolish.

50
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,520
I think it's one of the
most foolish aspects of the,

51
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:54,420
for the sport.

52
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,231
And you know,

53
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:56,520
we were talking today,

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:56,851
uh,

55
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:00,030
with some of the guys
at your camp about um,

56
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,380
like issues with MMA and with
the new owners are going to do,

57
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:04,940
uh,

58
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,940
now that the UFC has been purchased
and I hope they institute a program to

59
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:11,940
eliminate weight cutting.

60
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,360
I think it is one of the
biggest problems and biggest,

61
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,570
it's a time bomb and it's just
waiting to go off in everybody's face.

62
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,170
And a guy like Hofeld Dosantos
who's one of the elite of the elite,

63
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,460
before you lost it,

64
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:24,294
Eddie Alvarez,

65
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,710
a lot of people including me,

66
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:28,590
were making the argument that he
might be the best lightweight ever.

67
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,750
You look at a knocked
out Benson Henderson,

68
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,340
he beat the shit out of Nate Diaz.

69
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,980
He knocked out cowboy Serone in one round.

70
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,080
He's a fucking monster.

71
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:37,960
I mean he's a killer.

72
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:41,580
It beat the shit out of Anthony Pettis
for five rounds to win the title.

73
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:43,200
Just rolled him over,

74
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,610
just beat him down.

75
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,720
I,

76
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,460
you can make the argument
he's one of the greatest,

77
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,180
certainly one of the greatest light
weights of all time might be the best in

78
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:56,181
terms of like champions and the guy was
so depleted from his weight cut that he

79
00:02:59,501 --> 00:02:59,890
was like,

80
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,840
I heard he's passing out backstage.

81
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,490
You know,

82
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,150
I just,

83
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,241
uh,

84
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:04,840
just,

85
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,950
if that guy died,

86
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,600
what's imagine,

87
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,050
I mean,

88
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:08,741
God forbid,

89
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:09,340
right?

90
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,600
But let's imagine if a guy like that
dies because of a weight cut and it has

91
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:15,010
happened the last week.

92
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:20,070
The last death in MMA was in Brazil and
it was from a fighter who cut weight.

93
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,850
He died from weight cutting.

94
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:23,530
He didn't die from the fight itself.

95
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:23,980
I just,

96
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,980
I think it's a terrible thing that can
be eliminated and I think that if we did,

97
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:30,820
you would see better fights.

98
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,290
I don't really what I'm saying,

99
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,970
I think how,

100
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,391
I mean,

101
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:37,000
someone like that that's
having to cut that much,

102
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,260
are they really,

103
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,240
are you really seeing them at their best?

104
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:40,811
Absolutely.

105
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:41,260
Are Not.

106
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,220
There's no question about it.

107
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,440
I think cowboy looks way better when he's,

108
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,700
when he's fighting heavier,

109
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,743
much better.

110
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,160
Look how good he looks at one seven.

111
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,270
I think that's it.

112
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,163
He was always,

113
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,250
he's always been an elite fighter even
at 55 but at one 70 he looks like a world

114
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:54,670
champion.

115
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,540
Exactly.

116
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,141
Yeah.

117
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:58,750
I'm waiting to see a title
contention right there.

118
00:03:58,751 --> 00:03:59,584
That way.

119
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,970
I think it's an old thing.

120
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,670
It's a thing of the day about Cyborg.

121
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,240
Yeah.

122
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,330
Cause you were telling me what
she walks around at one 75.

123
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:07,690
Yeah,

124
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,523
she's,

125
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,581
and I said,

126
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:10,780
well Jack does,

127
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:11,321
she is,

128
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:11,950
how does she,

129
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,450
how does she cut that much?

130
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,430
I mean that seems like an impossibility.

131
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,730
She does it sheer strength of will.

132
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,690
George Lockhart,

133
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:20,800
who's her coach,

134
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,590
who's a Oh really,

135
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,910
really high level,

136
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:24,480
um,

137
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,860
nutritionist and weight cutting expert
and he gets her down to that weight but

138
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:29,700
it's not pretty,

139
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,031
you know,

140
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:33,060
there's a video of her
struggling to make one 40 the,

141
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,700
the weight classes in the UFC for women.

142
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,130
As of right now there's only two,

143
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,340
there is a one 15 and then there's one
35 and they've experimented with one 25

144
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,490
that talked about doing one
25 pound weight classes.

145
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,481
Um,

146
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:51,420
like a title at one 25 but
as of yet it doesn't exist.

147
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,370
Um,

148
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,920
but I think honestly Cyborg is said
that really her best way class classes,

149
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,140
even 45 what she's a
champion of an invicta.

150
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,250
Her best way class would be 55.

151
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:02,630
Yeah,

152
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,331
I would say.

153
00:05:03,331 --> 00:05:03,700
Yeah.

154
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,320
And there's other girls out there
man build it and they will come,

155
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,800
you know,

156
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,550
I think 55 would be a really good
women's class cause you'd almost,

157
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:17,050
you could almost have that like
Mark Hunt Brock Lesnar's style.

158
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:22,390
You'd get some real just powerhouses in
there that are still not too big where

159
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:24,180
they're out of shape.

160
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,500
But they could just,

161
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,330
I mean they could be like Cyborg.

162
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,530
I think if you built it,

163
00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:32,250
you'd have people coming
from other countries that
you probably don't even know

164
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:33,084
about,

165
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:33,660
I think.

166
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,300
I think you certainly
would after a few years.

167
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,370
And that's just an investment that I
think they have to make within women's MMA

168
00:05:41,371 --> 00:05:42,204
right now,

169
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,420
women's MMA is,

170
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:46,750
is where men's MMA was when
the UFC was first purchased.

171
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,220
There's a lot of people don't realize,

172
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:51,520
but when the UFC bought the,

173
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:53,170
when they purchased it
from the old owners,

174
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,820
they eliminated the 155
pound weight class because a,

175
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,870
they used to have a one 55 then
they had a one 70 and then they had,

176
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,190
I think they had a middle weight and a
light heavyweight and heavyweight still,

177
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,750
but they didn't have anything lower than
one 70 so a lot of guys either left the

178
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:16,190
UFC to fight in other organizations or
they moved up to one 70 and competed at

179
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:20,180
one 70 and some guys were like really
oversized or undersized for that weight

180
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:20,930
class.

181
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,763
So

182
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,170
that's not enough.

183
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,930
Obviously,

184
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,010
you mean that it's really important
that for a guy like mighty mouse,

185
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,740
like if there wasn't a
125 pound weight class,

186
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:32,150
which were mighty mouse competes,

187
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:37,250
we wouldn't be able to see the best
fighter of all time compete in his perfect

188
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:39,920
way class or one 35 you know,

189
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:44,120
you wouldn't be able to see Dominic Cruz
compete at his optimal weight class one

190
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:48,110
45 you wouldn't be able to see Josie
Aldo going that reign of terror for all

191
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:48,591
those years.

192
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:53,591
You wouldn't be able to see Conor
McGregor fight at one 45 and beat Aldo and

193
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:55,850
then 55 54 for the long time,

194
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,320
55 which is one of the most competitive
and talent rich divisions in the UFC

195
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:01,280
didn't even exist.

196
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,721
And you know,

197
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:05,690
so I think that the UFC,

198
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,330
if they really want to make
that commitment for women's MMA,

199
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:11,660
they should have a full range of weight
classes for those girls to compete at.

200
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,100
I think they should start maybe even
lower than one 15 I mean you could,

201
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,660
you can make a real strong argument for
105 pound woman's class a one five a one

202
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:25,210
15 to one 25 and then I think really
the trend of those 10 pound per weight

203
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,590
class that should exist,

204
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,800
the men's division as well,

205
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,090
there's two big,

206
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,780
the bat that gaps in the men's
divisions are way too big.

207
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,720
There's one 70 and then
there's 15 counts higher.

208
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,100
One 85 that's a big jump.

209
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,260
And then there's 20 pounds above that.

210
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,930
85 to two oh five 20 pounds.

211
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:47,140
Think about taking 2016 ounce t boned
steaks and that's how much bigger that guy

212
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:49,700
is.

213
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,780
Then the guy before him,

214
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,930
then you go to oh five to two 65 so think
about taking 60 t bone stage six zero

215
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:03,530
it's stacking up and thinking about all
the horsepower that comes with all that

216
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:04,364
weight.

217
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,533
It just,

218
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,470
there's too,

219
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,450
the gaps are too large.

220
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,070
It's too few weight classes.

221
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,640
So I think the UFC would be,

222
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,990
it would be very smart for them
to make more weight classes,

223
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:21,440
do a weight class every 10 pounds and
eliminate the weight cutting if they

224
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:22,190
could.

225
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,610
And I think it can be done there.

226
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,200
They're probably going to have to
get rid of some champions though.

227
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,550
Not Get rid of,

228
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:31,770
but they're going to have to re you
going to have to move radio around is

229
00:08:31,771 --> 00:08:32,604
around.

230
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,640
And the people who are just samples,

231
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:35,211
yeah,

232
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:36,290
they're not going to want to do that.

233
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:36,830
You know,

234
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,663
you're not going to be able to,

235
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,190
it's going to be a hard fight to
tell a guy like Dominick Cruz,

236
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,024
he can't cut weight.

237
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:41,511
You know,

238
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:43,610
when he's the world champion and say,

239
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:44,180
look man,

240
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:44,831
what do you weigh?

241
00:08:44,831 --> 00:08:47,900
Weigh one 55 and you're going
to have to fight at one 55.
