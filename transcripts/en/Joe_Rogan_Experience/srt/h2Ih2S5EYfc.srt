1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,451

doot,

8
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:03,030

the car,

13
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,823
the airport,

14
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,930

19
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:28,860

20
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,830
Freddy Loc card is in the building.

21
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:32,730
Buckle up,

22
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:33,510
bitches.

23
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,890
Here we go.

24
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,820
Thought you're going to get the girl today

25
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,520
for Freddy.

26
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,210
Happy Sunday.

27
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,640
Happy Shark Week

28
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,630
and started going every three months.

29
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:57,450
Man,

30
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,910
they're wearing that shark week out.

31
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,030
Freddie Lockhart is in the building.

32
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:02,360
Please.

33
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,193
John,

34
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,680
one of the only humans that I
know that says son more than I do.

35
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,550
I say sunny.

36
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,130
Great today son.

37
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,970
I say by myself when I'm in the car,

38
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:17,420
when I see dudes on the phone get off the
phone son and they get the phone up to

39
00:01:17,421 --> 00:01:17,751
their ear,

40
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:20,060
which is illegal under California law.

41
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,710
I wonder how many fucking people have
died directly as a result of idiots being

42
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:25,221
on their phone.

43
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:29,270
Texting and driving and talking on the
phone with butter ear and losing it.

44
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:30,230
The peripheral vision.

45
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,910
I bet it's staggering numbers.

46
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,310
It's a lot worse than I
thought it was you at first.

47
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:34,701
I always like,

48
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:34,791
oh,

49
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:35,451
it's probably the worst.

50
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:37,700
It's like eating or doing
other things in the car,

51
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:39,980
but now there's so many times
they're just at the stop light.

52
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,670
Like really stop Facebooking.

53
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:42,620
It's a green light.

54
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,130
Yeah.

55
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,320
There's a lot of people that
just won't let that shit drop.

56
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:45,750
Yeah.

57
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,090
I have to make up like that.

58
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,830
I was trying to send a
tweet on the way here.

59
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,460
I'm like on,

60
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,820
you know your winding mountain
road almost dying the tweet.

61
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,590
Isn't that how they thought that Paris
Hilton was a Paris Hilton's plastic

62
00:01:57,591 --> 00:01:58,424
surgeon,

63
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,850
but it sounded so good.

64
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:03,290
I don't know why they ever clarified it.

65
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,460
It's just leave it out there.

66
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:04,821
Right.

67
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:05,091
You know,

68
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:09,380
he was all over the cliff and Mallon
tweeted about his dog and then a couple

69
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,180
seconds later died and they were
thinking that he was tweeting.

70
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:11,591
While he's driving,

71
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:12,350
but they don't know.

72
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,850
He could have been reading his tweets.

73
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,250
Know he might not have
been actually driving,

74
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:18,080
but how the fuck do you go off a cliff?

75
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,240
Especially if you had written
that cliff many a times.

76
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,400
I know Laurel Canyon
like the back of my hand,

77
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:25,520
I can try to call unless you think you're
in a goddamn Porsche commercial and

78
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:27,110
you're going sideways around corners.

79
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,700
There's this video that made me want
to get a GT three before it go on is a,

80
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,920
there's a video of a
Porsche on a mountain road.

81
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,390
It's a gt three and a mountain road at
some bad ass fucking rally driver and

82
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,710
he's on a mountain road and it's
like turning left and right.

83
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,580
He's going sideways around every corner.

84
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,830
Just knows what the fuck he's doing knows
how to handle that thing and it looks

85
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:49,664
so much fun.

86
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,530
You got One?

87
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:50,740
Yeah,

88
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,510
I got to gt three.

89
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,550
I got rid of that Barracuda.

90
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,633
Well did you?

91
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,210
Yeah,

92
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:54,981
we can never drove it.

93
00:02:54,981 --> 00:02:55,814
Just know for sure.

94
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,331
Well,

95
00:02:56,331 --> 00:02:59,230
I never drove it anyone out for shows
the first six months that I add it.

96
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,400
And then it almost killed me.

97
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,000
I talked,

98
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,830
I've talked about this
many times on the show.

99
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:04,390
So in the interest of brevity,

100
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,140
the,

101
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,400
when I got home one day,

102
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,860
the suspension fell off in the driveway,

103
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,930
the suspension detached from the frame.

104
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:11,741
And I was like,

105
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:12,251
what the fuck?

106
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:15,190
That could have happened like 10 minutes
ago when I was going 70 miles an hour

107
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:16,840
on the highway and I'd be a dead person.

108
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,190
That's like a quarter million dollar.

109
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,181
Yeah.

110
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:21,040
Well it didn't cost me that much,

111
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,060
but it's probably worth that much.

112
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,280
Like I got rid of it and I'm like,

113
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:24,850
no,

114
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,591
I sold it to a dude.

115
00:03:25,591 --> 00:03:27,670
Did I know some rich character?

116
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,990
You drive it around?

117
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,481
Yeah,

118
00:03:29,481 --> 00:03:29,690
he,

119
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,190
he's uh,

120
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,480
he owns like a big,

121
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:31,990
uh,

122
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,940
Ferrari refurbishing place.

123
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,430
He loves cars and he's got an
undercarriage to every once in awhile.

124
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,260
In fact,

125
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,190
James like the sandwich,

126
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,490
I pay white pink,

127
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,323
give him a hundred bucks,

128
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,220
given everybody a hundred
bucks to watch it.

129
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,110
And then one of the dudes
that I gave a hundred bucks,

130
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,540
now it's one of the cameraman for TMC.

131
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,370
So he comes down.

132
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:51,800
Yeah.

133
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,620
He goes down to the Improv and I'm like,

134
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:54,300
what's up dude?

135
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:54,620
I was like,

136
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:54,760
yeah,

137
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,550
you remember you used to make
me cry in your car for $100.

138
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,320
It's a terrible impression of him.

139
00:03:59,321 --> 00:03:59,950
I don't know why.

140
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,621
You know what?

141
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:01,454
That's all he deserve.

142
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,450
Some guys like

143
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,880
in a bad dude,

144
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:09,890
it's just a little on the shy
side on the extremely likely,

145
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:10,540
like you walked in,

146
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,650
like I wasn't drinking up

147
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,750
z a comic cause he tried to be calm.

148
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:17,921
He's a nice guy.

149
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:18,071
You know.

150
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:20,570
I actually even live in the same park.

151
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,870
I don't want to say live in the same room,

152
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,920
not in the same room with

153
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,920
you and wheels live in the same apartment.

154
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:30,754
One time

155
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,460
after I'd moved out,

156
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,170
I've lived in meals.

157
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,320
This house,

158
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,590
you might've been written,

159
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:39,640
somebody else's house,

160
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:40,470
you don't even know.

161
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,500
I was there for like a month.

162
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:45,000
And then I moved into Kelly endos
house and then those guys later on

163
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,830
and I'm like,

164
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:49,960
you know,

165
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,700
he's one of those weird weird guys.

166
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:52,720
If you don't know who we're talking about,

167
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:52,860
this,

168
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,040
this comic named wheels.

169
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:54,641
And,

170
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:54,780
uh,

171
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,520
he used to open for dice clay back
in the day and his claim to fame,

172
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:59,670
you can have it on his
website was the night nice.

173
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,700
Couldn't follow him.

174
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,500
He killed so hard can fund.

175
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:04,780
We can be the fuck are you talking about?

176
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,980
Like if you've never seen dice
performed love or hate dice.

177
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:10,780
Dice is a God damn pro.

178
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,793
Nobody does.

179
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,090
Nobody goes on and like,

180
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:14,880
I can't,

181
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,250
yeah,

182
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,450
I can't fall away.

183
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,190
It's impossible.

184
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:19,450
It's never happened ever.

185
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,171
But this dude,

186
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:21,004
it's awesome.

187
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,920
His stories or I don't want
to call him a compulsive liar,

188
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:25,340
but that's the only description of fence.

189
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,230
Grandiosity.

190
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,440
We did the La Jolla
once and he was like a,

191
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,090
you know I was professional pool player.

192
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,700
He's telling me he's a
professional pool player.

193
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,710
Really?

194
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,041
He goes,

195
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:36,401
oh yeah,

196
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:37,121
I hustled.

197
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:37,271
I,

198
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:37,601
you know,

199
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:38,081
I go,

200
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:38,591
dude,

201
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:39,401
I didn't know that.

202
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:39,750
I go,

203
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,290
I've been looking for
someone to play pool with.

204
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:41,551
Come Out,

205
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:42,384
let's play pool.

206
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,570
It's like a dollar game.

207
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,100
Do those would be like 30 bucks.

208
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,670
I won 30 games in a row.

209
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:46,901
I'm like,

210
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:47,740
this is ridiculous.

211
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:48,790
Where were you playing pro?

212
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,500
Cause I'm going to go over there
and started robbing people.

213
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,990
He never got out once,

214
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,940
never got out once.

215
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,601
I'll tell you one thing.

216
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:56,620
He said he's a hell of a cook.

217
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:56,821
No,

218
00:05:56,821 --> 00:05:57,750
I have ever had a spoon.

219
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,431
Yes,

220
00:05:58,431 --> 00:05:58,851
I did.

221
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:01,790
He catered and he brought it to the
comedy store and it was really good.

222
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:02,624
Yeah,

223
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,240
but I don't want to believe he made it.

224
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:07,640
I want to be with his fucking
stolen from some Mexican dude.

225
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,671
He got some pork.

226
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:12,250
I work on a farm for five
bucks an hour next time.

227
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,010
There's a lot of those guys in Hollywood,

228
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:16,380
man,

229
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,590
and he wouldn't need a lot
of guys that just completely,

230
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:19,550
totally full of shit.

231
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,990
She knows something when
you're on their level.

232
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:22,520
It takes me a while to figure that out.

233
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,110
Here's an Harvard to figure it out.

234
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:24,944
I'm just like,

235
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,190
you know,

236
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:26,811
especially now,

237
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:28,190
it's like I have the Internet.

238
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,203
Yeah.

239
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,650
Well now the problem is
they've established a long
tradition of line throughout

240
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:34,484
their whole life

241
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,400
and it helps to create this
world that they want to live.

242
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:40,861
Well.

243
00:06:40,861 --> 00:06:43,230
I think it's a lot of it
is also just impulsive.

244
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,850
The liars that I've known.

245
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:46,530
It seems like they just can't help it.

246
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,300
Like they have a hard time not lying.

247
00:06:48,301 --> 00:06:50,930
You know what's the weirdest is
successful liars like or the,

248
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,870
I'm not a name any names,

249
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:52,704
but there's comics.

250
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,510
Yeah.

251
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,343
Hell

252
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,173
yeah.

253
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,143
I love Eddie Griffin.

254
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,950
Eddy Griffin's but then
the back of the comedy,

255
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,650
I wants

256
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,050
how many?

257
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,910
Eight rounds yesterday.

258
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,300
We don't world champion kickboxer
and I'm going to tell you what,

259
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,530
for the first three rounds for the first
three rounds and they was getting the

260
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:11,364
best of me,

261
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,990
but for the last five he
didn't want none of this

262
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:17,431
cigarette.

263
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:20,420
In one hand I'm drinking the other and
meanwhile this guy's a movie star there.

264
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,620
He'll tell you things Nigga,

265
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,820
when I was studying at Harvard and before,

266
00:07:23,821 --> 00:07:24,654
yeah,

267
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,690
but after Oxford and before
Johns Hopkins I said,

268
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,131
Eddie,

269
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:30,360
I'm going to do some comedy.

270
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:30,931
It was like,

271
00:07:30,931 --> 00:07:33,690
the thing is he was a very talented dude.

272
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,290
Yeah,

273
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,071
brilliant dude.

274
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:37,200
It's like he had all of these attributes,

275
00:07:37,201 --> 00:07:38,250
but then he would just like,

276
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,260
oh Nigga been to the moon.

277
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:41,731
I'm like,

278
00:07:41,731 --> 00:07:43,200
I'm sure you have not been to the moon.

279
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,610
I don't think you have.

280
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,230
He's a liar movie star.

281
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:46,440
Yeah,

282
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,320
and that's what I don't get it.

283
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,091
It's like you're at you.

284
00:07:48,091 --> 00:07:49,350
You've knocked it out of the park.

285
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:54,110
Did something that 0.001% people
in this town do congratulations.

286
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,710
And here you're trying to tell me that
you own coca cola to like come on.

287
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,990
He's so crazy.

288
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,930
I'm already impressed.

289
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,550
But that's why he's so talented.

290
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,100
He can just get on stage
and just talk shit.

291
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,180
He's one of the few guys that I've ever
seen that will get on stage and not have

292
00:08:09,181 --> 00:08:11,760
a fucking clue as to what
he's going to talk about.

293
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,000
Right.

294
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,430
And he'll stay up there for
five hours and he always did.

295
00:08:14,431 --> 00:08:16,860
It's like I'd always extract
one thing I liked from a comic,

296
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:19,210
even if I didn't like that comic
very much as he could pass.

297
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,320
Can think of it as next step is like,

298
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:22,531
man,

299
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:22,990
just hang.

300
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,610
I would say yeah,

301
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,150
just face and smoke and stare.

302
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:27,430
Oh,

303
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:32,140
also let it seem like you were supposed
to be dwelling on the last oh deep shit

304
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,050
hit you.

305
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,390
Like he just just inundating you
with an avalanche of analytics.

306
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:36,750
Like,

307
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,800
Oh my God,

308
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:40,770
let me come up from the
promote that we're exposed to.

309
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,790
But being comics and by being comics in
the pressure cooker that is Hollywood,

310
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,350
you're exposed to psychological lessons
at the average person just never gets to

311
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,460
deal with.

312
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:50,610
Right.

313
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:50,851
You know,

314
00:08:50,851 --> 00:08:53,030
you get to watch someone become crazy,

315
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:53,903
get to watch someone,

316
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,990
you get to watch someone lose their,

317
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,490
when they get a little bit of fame.

318
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,630
Those guys are fascinating.

319
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,660
You know the people that get a little
development deal and all of a sudden a

320
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:02,880
yelling at people and
ordering people around.

321
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:06,480
And do you know the best story that
the story of the Boondock Saints,

322
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:06,811
the kid,

323
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:07,644
the truck up,

324
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:08,881
dude,

325
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,190
we have talked about this on
the podcast very recently.

326
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:13,700
This is documentary right there night.

327
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,300
That's the perfect example.

328
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:16,134
Yes.

329
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,080
Except for the folks that don't
know this guy that made the movie,

330
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:19,980
the Boondock Saints,

331
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:23,980
and they made a documentary on him
called overnight and he's just an

332
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:27,660
insufferable cunt of a human
being who got some success.

333
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,050
Right.

334
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,430
And fucked it all up.

335
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,280
Success though I haven't heard
of since then in Hollywood,

336
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:32,680
like,

337
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,080
like they bought the bar,

338
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:35,040
the kid worked at,

339
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,920
they didn't come.

340
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,650
They promised it was part of the deal.

341
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:41,310
Miramax Harvey Weinstein promise to buy
him the bar and then Cole on the bar,

342
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,110
because that was back then
when they had hopes that like,

343
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:43,291
hey,

344
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,670
Ben Affleck and Matt Damon did it.

345
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:44,881
We can,

346
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:45,860
we're star makers now.

347
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:46,141
We're,

348
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:46,240
we're,

349
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,910
we're going to take an
scripts and make them big.

350
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:49,290
That was the added their thing in the mid,

351
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,400
late nineties Miramax,

352
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,990
they're huge into that and so I was like,

353
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:52,141
yeah,

354
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:53,160
they can't get that deal.

355
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,260
And he's talking like people
are lining up to make,

356
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,840
I haven't seen that kind of heat
around the script since then.

357
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,530
The dudes who were lining up to get in
that all Boston Irish dukes were like

358
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,040
really clamoring to get in there and then
it started to whittle down to all you

359
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,020
have is Willem defoe who was
in it from the beginning,

360
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:09,410
but like that's the only guy
I think he was stayed at.

361
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,590
Can you see the movie though?

362
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:10,901
Man?

363
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:11,341
It just,

364
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:13,860
it's an amazing documentary on what,

365
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,210
what can happen to,

366
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:16,530
you can add it all.

367
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,070
Yeah.

368
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:17,970
You can lose your shit,

369
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:18,360
man.

370
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,260
There's a lot of people,

371
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:23,280
I've met so many people that have just
completely lost their shit along the way

372
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:23,970
too.

373
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,350
Just mediocre success.

374
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:26,510
Just a little tiny bit.

375
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,720
When you see them,

376
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,171
you know,

377
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:28,501
letting,

378
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:32,060
you know they got $1 million guarantee
and there's fucking show they're going to

379
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:32,881
put it on right after.

380
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:34,530
Friends are always going to fail.

381
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,513
We're in,

382
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,660
but don't you think it's funny though,

383
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:38,760
like in the grand scheme of
things that the bigger they are,

384
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:40,590
usually the cooler are like a Tom Hanks.

385
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:41,790
It's probably not a decade.

386
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,650
You know what I mean?

387
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,231
Or some of them.

388
00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:43,720
Yeah.

389
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,060
Or say in the world of comedy,

390
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,060
Chris Rock shows up to the comedy
story shows up alone with a notebook.

391
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,560
Ask us if he can go on.

392
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,620
Right.

393
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:50,970
You know,

394
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:51,391
and he's,

395
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:51,721
you know,

396
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:53,760
arguably the top comic in the world,

397
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,990
at least one of the most
recognized right now.

398
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,430
Take somebody who's like maybe
the 156 best comic in the world,

399
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,470
but men steal.

400
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,841
Yeah,

401
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:01,591
something like that.

402
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:06,591
What I will get on stage and Bogart
and go on pat and showing up to a war

403
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,021
theater.

404
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:07,860
It's like you can't,

405
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,820
you know if the number one guys
exercising that he much humility,

406
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,310
everybody below needs to follow suit.

407
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:14,940
It's a,

408
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,261
it's a,

409
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:20,261
an amazing dance that you play when
you're trying to get attention on stage

410
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,380
because you're trying to get
these people to look at you.

411
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:27,381
So you're trying to like perform the most
entertaining set possible and the best

412
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:29,004
way possible,

413
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,260
but in some way or another and you have
to divert all that adulation away from

414
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,094
yourself.

415
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,610
You have to figure out a way to accept
it and then like turn it right back to

416
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:41,370
the people and you can't bathe in it.

417
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,260
You can't like take it seriously.

418
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,570
I think that you are the
shit or you will suck.

419
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,250
Then you got to remember too,

420
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:48,360
we're not saving fucking life.

421
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,313
You know what I mean?

422
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,340
And that's like another thing too.

423
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:51,091
It's like with comedy,

424
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:52,440
but you have so many other interests.

425
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,120
It's like we have 23 and a
half hours a day to spare.

426
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,450
You can either become just
a fucking miserable prick
or you can educate yourself

427
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,800
or pick up another passion,

428
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:00,551
you know,

429
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:01,090
and it's like,

430
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:01,181
oh,

431
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:04,060
you can become completely
obsessed with your career.

432
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:07,630
Exactly quotes and not have any other
thing that you turn to and then lose your

433
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:08,080
shit.

434
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,801
Cause to be a career.

435
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:10,900
A law allows you to do all the
other things you wanted to do.

436
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,171
It's like,

437
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:11,441
okay,

438
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:13,660
now I have a pass to do the
other things I want to do.

439
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,300
There's a,

440
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:14,830
uh,

441
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,780
an interesting thing
that Mark Marin just did.

442
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:18,670
He did this keynote speech at a,

443
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:22,570
the just for laughs and I listened in on
it cause I have this sort of love hate

444
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:26,800
thing with Ma'am Marin helped me
out when I was an open miker and uh,

445
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,720
gave me some real solid advice
and real solid compliments.

446
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:32,561
And uh,

447
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:33,041
I remember,

448
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:33,350
you know,

449
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,470
Colin been doing comedy for
a real short period of time,

450
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:36,304
less than a year.

451
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,230
And Marin was established and I was like,

452
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:38,620
wow,

453
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,550
I can't believe this guy just,

454
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,000
you know,

455
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,410
just totally pumped me up.

456
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:42,220
And I was like,

457
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,230
I can fucking do this.

458
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:43,430
You know,

459
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,900
I've,

460
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,501
I felt like,

461
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:44,771
you know,

462
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:45,604
I got,

463
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,090
you know,

464
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,860
from a guy like that who was real
stingy with compliments through,

465
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,350
you know.

466
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:49,490
Yeah.

467
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,130
So for years I've been trying
to be so fucking nice to him,

468
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:54,760
like,

469
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,170
because of that note,

470
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:59,410
so every opportunity to shit
on him or to fuck with him,

471
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:04,411
I've avoided and ducked because I felt
like I owed him for something that

472
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:05,890
happened when we were really young.

473
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,940
And so,

474
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,470
um,

475
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:07,750
you know,

476
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,310
that's why I did his podcast,

477
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:11,740
even though he had said some stupid
shit about me and doesn't even know me.

478
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:13,390
Like we need to have
conversations and like,

479
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,640
what did they say about you?

480
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:14,900
Oh,

481
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,550
just said,

482
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,230
he said a bunch of really dumb shit.

483
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,150
One of the things about that,

484
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,160
one of the really dumb
things that he said is that,

485
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:21,640
uh,

486
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,610
I've done more bad to comedy than men.

487
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:28,780
Sia has because of doing fear
factor and his rationale.

488
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:29,980
This is a true argument.

489
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,470
His rationale was that
in doing fear factor,

490
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:36,670
I had taken work away from standup
comics who also worked as writers.

491
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:42,210
So the idea is that in me being a
standup comic who also has a side job of

492
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:43,930
hosting somehow or another,

493
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:45,310
these other standup comics,

494
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,240
their side job of writing sitcoms
outside of standup comedy,

495
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,920
their side job is somehow or
another more valid that it's still,

496
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:55,000
it's still not comedy,

497
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:55,301
it's none.

498
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,130
Let stand up comedy.

499
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,480
So you're talking about a guy who,

500
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,540
a massive plagiarist who just ruined
comics' lives and you're comparing them to

501
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:05,200
me because our hosting a game show.

502
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,153
But this,

503
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,390
watching this,

504
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,800
listening to this keynote,

505
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,550
now I understand a little bit better
because three years ago he was talking

506
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:16,600
about how he was so depressed
he couldn't get any road work.

507
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,583
He couldn't,

508
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,260
couldn't get booked anywhere and no
one wanted to have meetings with them.

509
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:21,160
Nothing was going on.

510
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:21,970
And you know,

511
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,530
he was thinking about committing suicide.

512
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,030
And this is just three years ago,

513
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,560
it was before he started
doing his podcast.

514
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,000
And you know,

515
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,010
this is all the shit was going down.

516
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:30,191
I mean,

517
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:30,730
this is,

518
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,510
you know,

519
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,250
three years ago I wasn't
doing fear factor,

520
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:35,410
but I'm sure before then the
bitterness was just as much.

521
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,370
When some people see
other people get success,

522
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,190
they fester and it
drives me fucking crazy.

523
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:45,340
And they want to look for holes in it to
want to look for things that are wrong

524
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:45,581
with it.

525
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:46,414
Instead of saying,

526
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:46,841
Oh,

527
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:47,740
look at that fucking guy,

528
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:48,401
he's going to do it.

529
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:48,700
Like,

530
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:48,940
like,

531
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,050
I love drew Carey.

532
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,063
Okay,

533
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,830
I wouldn't want to host the price is
right for a fucking million dollars an

534
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:55,580
episode.

535
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,120
I'd be like,

536
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,050
God damn,

537
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:57,710
that's what he's doing.

538
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,670
The price is right or is that,

539
00:14:58,850 --> 00:14:59,683
uh,

540
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,120
he took over Bob Market.

541
00:15:01,121 --> 00:15:03,160
But you know what that shows me that you,

542
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:06,230
you're a creature who is
survival of the fittest.

543
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,670
When this business changes,

544
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:08,480
you adapt.

545
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,631
Well,

546
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:08,971
let's see.

547
00:15:08,971 --> 00:15:09,130
No,

548
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,340
he decided to take a job.

549
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,300
This is what I looked at it.

550
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:11,900
I mean,

551
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,150
look who drew Carey's
your great personality.

552
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:15,290
He's a warm,

553
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,160
friendly guy.

554
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,180
You know,

555
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:17,570
like,

556
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,710
what's the other guy's name?

557
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,600
The the black dude who sings

558
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,330
Brady?

559
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:23,870
Yeah.

560
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,703
What's his name?

561
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:25,941
Wayne Brady.

562
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:26,520
Wayne,

563
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,180
why don't want to call them?

564
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:27,770
Well,

565
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,730
I've kitten his hand as smoke,

566
00:15:29,731 --> 00:15:30,830
too much weed.

567
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,061
But anyway,

568
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:32,420
he,

569
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,530
when he does his show,

570
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:34,340
which one is he doing?

571
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,780
He's doing one of those daytime shows too.

572
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:36,591
What was he doing?

573
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:37,160
A talk show.

574
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,340
Yeah,

575
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,220
and one of those fucking price
is right or the other one

576
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,310
name that tune whatever the fuck is doing.

577
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,353
It's not good.

578
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:44,761
And it's,

579
00:15:44,761 --> 00:15:47,630
it's one of those things where you
look like it's like soul crushing shit,

580
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,470
right?

581
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,640
It's just a fucking Gig.

582
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:50,600
When I see drew Carey,

583
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:53,600
I don't go to fucking drew Carey sold
out look who could drive your persona.

584
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,540
But Marin has this thing
because he was so unsuccessful.

585
00:15:56,541 --> 00:16:01,100
He looks for reasons why other
people success is either invalid or,

586
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,080
or negative or bad.

587
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,591
But this,

588
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:08,591
this fucking festering personality of
constantly obsessing about his career and

589
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:10,154
negativity is,

590
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,021
it was a fascinating,

591
00:16:11,021 --> 00:16:11,510
the keynote,

592
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,150
one of the things he said
that he joked around,

593
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,240
it was a really funny joke,

594
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:14,900
but he,

595
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,010
I'm the guy who thought,

596
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,901
Louise,

597
00:16:16,901 --> 00:16:18,710
a TV show should have been called.

598
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:19,131
Fuck you,

599
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:22,700
Mark Marin know because
they started out together.

600
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:23,140
You know,

601
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,910
it's got some fucking crazy
jealous and it's about Louie.

602
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:28,010
Then he's up in Boston or in New York.

603
00:16:28,011 --> 00:16:28,191
Yeah,

604
00:16:28,191 --> 00:16:30,180
I knew in Boston when I was an open Mike.

605
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,400
He was at same kind of with
me and he was always busy.

606
00:16:33,401 --> 00:16:34,234
Khan to everybody.

607
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:34,850
It's a country.

608
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,670
Jamie kills teas and
kind of to Ari Shapiro.

609
00:16:36,671 --> 00:16:38,540
This Brian Callen wanted to beat him up.

610
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:38,840
Oh,

611
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,950
he's been a cut to me.

612
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,793
He's a cunt.

613
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,160
And the reason why he's a Qantas
cause he's a cunt to himself.

614
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,170
He's not happy with the,

615
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,530
is a really nice guy.

616
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,900
Nice guy.

617
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:48,201
Ever.

618
00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:48,861
He insulted,

619
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:51,080
count on stage in front of Accountants,

620
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:52,450
friends who came to see him in New York.

621
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,300
Not a disrespect.

622
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,260
Cowan wanted to kill him.

623
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,350
You know,

624
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,710
Kellen even like said something
and threatened to him and said,

625
00:16:57,711 --> 00:16:58,121
look and I,

626
00:16:58,121 --> 00:16:59,270
I'll hit you like,

627
00:16:59,271 --> 00:16:59,660
okay,

628
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,910
you want to fuck with me and
fucking mean front of my friends.

629
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,953
Like I'll hit you.

630
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,850
I don't know what happened
or who he just was,

631
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:05,900
just the stories that I'm getting.

632
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:09,770
But I know that he gave Ari unsolicited
criticism and I know he fucks with

633
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:14,270
Kilstein Brian and you fucking with the
levels constantly tweaking your fucking

634
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:15,020
with my head Bro.

635
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,853
Leave it alone.

636
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,870
But why's he doing that?

637
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,351
Who's doing that?

638
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:19,550
Cause he's doing that to himself.

639
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,200
His whole mind is fucked.

640
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:25,280
He's a guy who's been doing comedy for
forever but still can't get successful.

641
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,920
We were in Irvine the other day,

642
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,380
we did the Irvine Improv and I'm like,

643
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:30,890
uh,

644
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,540
do you guys pretty much
sell out here every weekend?

645
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,040
It's not one mark man was here.

646
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,400
It was like a barely go to a hundred
tickets sold each show and I was like a

647
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,750
hundred tickets at the Irvine Improv.

648
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:39,531
Like that's impossible.

649
00:17:39,531 --> 00:17:41,180
So it's like this,

650
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,930
this,

651
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,390
this career that he's
had for all these years,

652
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:45,380
25 plus years.

653
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,280
It's,

654
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:46,790
you know,

655
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,100
he's obviously done a lot of shit wrong
until we did this podcast and this

656
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:51,570
podcast and you just nail it.

657
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:56,870
Podcasting figured out what he's good at
is really getting into people's minds.

658
00:17:56,871 --> 00:17:59,190
She knows his own neurosis
is he knows his own,

659
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,770
his own fears and hopes and dreams.

660
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:04,440
And stand up and he can
relate to other comics.

661
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,780
And then now he's sort of
like calming down and being,

662
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,280
but he still does do she shit.

663
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:10,110
Like Anthony Bourdain is
going to be on my podcast.

664
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:10,980
Oh seriously?

665
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:11,281
Yeah.

666
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:12,280
And he wrote uh,

667
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:12,661
Hey,

668
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:15,900
I heard you're going to do
Rogan's podcast but he ain't me.

669
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,460
You know,

670
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,780
it would be deep.

671
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,090
I like to go and that's
exactly what he ain't me.

672
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:21,924
It would be deep like,

673
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,711
come on man,

674
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:25,170
go go take a Goddamn Yoga class.

675
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,620
Go to one of those places where
everybody just hugs everybody,

676
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,760
you know what I mean?

677
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,050
Just go and get some hugs,

678
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:31,830
man.

679
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,663
What the what the eff,

680
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:37,670
this negative fostering fucking kind of
thinking is exactly what we're talking

681
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:41,820
about where people don't have shit
outside of their career and if they don't

682
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,170
have a bunch of other things,

683
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,580
if you have something going on,

684
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,580
I could care less about what's going on
with others that they never taken away

685
00:18:47,581 --> 00:18:47,910
from me.

686
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,170
You're not taking work away from me,

687
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:50,310
which nobody is.

688
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,001
Nobody is,

689
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:51,330
you know,

690
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,320
I'm fine with that.

691
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:56,520
And it's like I that comedy cop thing
to me and about a year into comedy when

692
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:56,761
it's like,

693
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:57,211
holy crap,

694
00:18:57,211 --> 00:19:00,280
I've got my own thing to say now I'm
going to be concerned with who goes on for

695
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:00,481
me,

696
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:01,231
what goes on after me.

697
00:19:01,231 --> 00:19:01,730
I don't care.

698
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:01,920
Well,

699
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,530
it's another thing that Marin had
said on the show once about his,

700
00:19:04,531 --> 00:19:04,980
uh,

701
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,750
his parents never fostered a healthy
sense of competitiveness in him.

702
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,450
And he's one of those guys
that like if he's losing,

703
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,650
he'll just turn the board over.

704
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:15,660
I'm just fucking take
your ball and go home.

705
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,560
And it's that,

706
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,560
that crazy sort of fucking
dysfunctional thinking that,

707
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,780
that thinking that this
disconnected is what it is.

708
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,720
You're disconnected from other
people and you want it all.

709
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,340
You want all the adulation.

710
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,151
You want all the love.

711
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:31,710
And if you're not getting what you need,

712
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,850
fuck everybody else.

713
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:33,990
Then negativity starts.

714
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,750
You start throwing your
negativity at other people.

715
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:40,980
And the only way you can truly be
positive at all is if you feel like you're

716
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:42,990
getting enough positivity to be okay.

717
00:19:42,991 --> 00:19:44,190
I've got a good level here.

718
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,590
I got a good stash of positivity.

719
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,790
Now I can be nice.

720
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,340
It's a fascinating psychological study
to watch all these guys to watch these

721
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,670
mark Marin guys said were like
literally on the brink of suicide,

722
00:19:56,671 --> 00:19:57,240
you know,

723
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,950
and I think I tried to like mark.

724
00:19:58,951 --> 00:19:59,550
I really do.

725
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,200
I try to be nice to him as much as I can.

726
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,034
I try to like him,

727
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:02,670
but it's like,

728
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,061
man,

729
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:04,800
I have a hard time seeing all that.

730
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,890
I want to just throttle
a guy like that and go,

731
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:08,131
look,

732
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:11,910
let's sit down and write down what the
fuck is wrong with you and just work it

733
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,890
out for once and for all right,

734
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,860
let's not deal with this
for 25 fucking more years.

735
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,340
Let's figure this shit out.

736
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,680
Frankie paste this thing,

737
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:20,514
man.

738
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,750
Exactly.

739
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,621
Exactly though.

740
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:23,760
Let's not go that better.

741
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,380
He's a fucking guy.

742
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:26,730
That guy I want.

743
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,680
He got mad at me once
because I called him.

744
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,280
I said the old school comedy
talent of Frankie Pace.

745
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:32,971
That's what I said,

746
00:20:32,971 --> 00:20:36,570
old school and he doesn't understand
that old school is like skills.

747
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,171
It was like,

748
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:38,490
no man is old school.

749
00:20:38,491 --> 00:20:41,160
Like my man's an old school
[inaudible] route karate guy.

750
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,290
You can say that to a dude,

751
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,140
they'll give me some knuckles,

752
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:43,771
he'd be laughing,

753
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:43,951
you know,

754
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:44,820
that's like a compliment.

755
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,290
But when I called him,

756
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:46,990
you know,

757
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,801
an old Mi ma,

758
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:48,551
he's sucks.

759
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:50,230
I shouldn't even said old school.

760
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:50,890
Like I said,

761
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,520
go on stage without your stupid fucking
devil horns in your bag of shit and you

762
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:57,270
bring with you everywhere and then even
a veto without the talent liability.

763
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:57,711
Here you go.

764
00:20:57,711 --> 00:20:58,900
He's a kind of a human,

765
00:20:58,901 --> 00:20:59,920
but it's the same thing.

766
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:04,600
It's like here's a guy who doesn't feel
like there's enough positivity out there

767
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,560
and if he hasn't stockpile
a big stash of it,

768
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,370
at least fucking kids,

769
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:10,250
they think they're funny.

770
00:21:10,251 --> 00:21:10,620
You know,

771
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,890
I get to do was talk dirty.

772
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:18,700
So he goes on stage and introduces me
after I introduced him with this old

773
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:19,930
school thing and he goes,

774
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:22,890
this guy thinks I'm old
school and this and I and I,

775
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,870
and then he shits on me and he start
shitting on my jokes is all before he

776
00:21:25,871 --> 00:21:27,010
brings me up on stage.

777
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:27,671
So I go on stage.

778
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:28,270
I'm not even,

779
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,610
I didn't even know
exactly how to handle him.

780
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,800
So I go on and say as I go,

781
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,261
first of all,

782
00:21:32,261 --> 00:21:32,650
dude,

783
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,480
before I address any
of what you just said,

784
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,050
so I just start talking him as he's
walking through the crowd and go,

785
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,890
old school is a positive thing.

786
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,401
I go,

787
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:40,240
am I right folks?

788
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,410
And they start clapping.

789
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:41,801
I go,

790
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:42,880
it's like a rapper term.

791
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:43,391
I go,

792
00:21:43,391 --> 00:21:44,224
when you say someone's older,

793
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:44,620
he goes,

794
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,330
variable that you must be new school.

795
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,170
I go,

796
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,580
are you trying to say that I'm not good?

797
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,570
They don't like me.

798
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,051
I go,

799
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:50,740
what are you trying to say?

800
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,061
So then I,

801
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:53,890
I start smiling and instead
of getting upset at him,

802
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,270
I start mocking him.

803
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:55,641
I go from a,

804
00:21:55,641 --> 00:21:56,620
how do you not like me?

805
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,390
Do you not like my comedy?

806
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:58,661
I go,

807
00:21:58,661 --> 00:21:59,350
what's the matter?

808
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,591
I go,

809
00:21:59,591 --> 00:22:02,200
it does it make you feel uncomfortable
when people laugh harder at my shit than

810
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:02,860
yours?

811
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,200
And that's when he got
fucking pissed off at me.

812
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:05,950
And he goes,

813
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,660
you fucking wish you were as good in me.

814
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:07,990
I go,

815
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,621
come on man.

816
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:09,550
We all just watched you.

817
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:10,540
You ain't that special.

818
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:10,901
I go,

819
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:11,800
didn't you guys see him?

820
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,191
I go,

821
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:12,731
you saw him,

822
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,260
right?

823
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:13,550
And then I,

824
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,120
I go,

825
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,030
what does he got like
devil horns on and shit.

826
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:16,421
I go,

827
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:16,811
what was that?

828
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:17,441
It was that good.

829
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:18,221
Was that amazing?

830
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:19,480
Is that some breakthrough shit?

831
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:19,940
Like,

832
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,471
look at you,

833
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:21,130
you little fat.

834
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:21,730
Fuck.

835
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:22,151
And he goes,

836
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:23,950
you're going to look like
me when you're my age.

837
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:24,191
I go,

838
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:25,660
do you think you look
like me when you were,

839
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:26,523
you were my age.

840
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,390
Who would the fuck are you talking about?

841
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:28,970
What are you saying?

842
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:29,091
I'm,

843
00:22:29,091 --> 00:22:29,710
I'm you.

844
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,310
You're me.

845
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,090
Or we won.

846
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:31,500
Oh my,

847
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,333
you're a cunt.

848
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,131
You're a cunt of a man.

849
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:34,450
Get out and get a bitter fuck to be like,

850
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:36,060
you'll look like this kind of a band.

851
00:22:36,061 --> 00:22:37,120
He's that guy though.

852
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:39,430
He is the the guy you want to be.

853
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:42,760
Business owes me something that's
business doesn't owe you a goddamn thing.

854
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,330
You know a lot of those guys on,

855
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,320
but it's like an old
people always say too,

856
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,010
it's like Hollywood.

857
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:47,310
So it's,

858
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,041
it's so crazy.

859
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:48,681
It's so hard to make it.

860
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:49,690
It's the fairest business.

861
00:22:49,691 --> 00:22:51,850
I know it never shoes talent away.

862
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:52,081
No,

863
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:52,141
no,

864
00:22:52,141 --> 00:22:52,330
no.

865
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:52,880
Get out of here.

866
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,713
We don't age,

867
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,120
they never shoot talent away.

868
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,580
But those guys who can find
all these things wrong,

869
00:22:57,581 --> 00:22:59,500
whether it's the club booker or whatever,

870
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:00,640
like it's mostly at the comedy store,

871
00:23:00,641 --> 00:23:01,211
you'll find guys,

872
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:01,510
it's like,

873
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,321
I'll always say him,

874
00:23:02,321 --> 00:23:04,720
what other club is putting you on silent,

875
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,190
but I'll never get another club.

876
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:06,341
Well,

877
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:08,860
the comic store has got a
fucking half a million assholes.

878
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,330
There really shouldn't be on stage,

879
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:10,930
but they're,

880
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,680
they've snuck into that system back
in the 1970 [inaudible] stuck there.

881
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,790
You can go there any given night on a
Monday or Tuesday and you'll see three or

882
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:19,451
four comics.

883
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:24,451
You can't fucking believe a professional
comedian at the comedy store in

884
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,444
Hollywood.

885
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,021
Man,

886
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:26,510
when I was,

887
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,340
that's Mecca.

888
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,200
The best of the best and
the worst of the worst.

889
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:29,801
The worst,

890
00:23:29,801 --> 00:23:30,120
you know.

891
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,870
But beyond bad advocates,

892
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,730
high in the basement
goes real fucking vape.

893
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:34,720
But you know,

894
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,180
a lot of room clears back in
the day we would see them.

895
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:37,690
We would look at that.

896
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,523
That's the face you,

897
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,341
that's exactly what,

898
00:23:39,341 --> 00:23:40,690
say you would look at the lineup,

899
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,090
you would see Freddy Lockhart and
then you look at before you and UCL.

900
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,123
Ah,

901
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:44,471
there,

902
00:23:44,471 --> 00:23:47,190
I remember when I worked the cover
booth and I turned my shirt inside out

903
00:23:47,191 --> 00:23:49,610
because I was embarrassed to work there
because I have the answer to the likes

904
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:54,611
of ways like Billy and Rozzy on stage
date year or whoever is putting on given

905
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:56,900
eulogies as they do and I remember you,

906
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:58,230
you drove the NSX and I,

907
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,620
I remember it was like if I
saw that insects pulling up,

908
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,610
you were like the calvary.

909
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:01,940
It's like,

910
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,680
oh,

911
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,500
a legitimate bonafide comedian.

912
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,170
Oh real comedian that I can show what
all these people that had to look in the

913
00:24:07,171 --> 00:24:11,570
straight face in charge of $20 to see
the likes of Dave here up there telling

914
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,770
why is it my cell phone worked
with the antenna down but up.

915
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,371
It works.

916
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,210
What's wow.

917
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:17,780
Huh?

918
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,070
That was his closer,

919
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,410
well the poor guy,

920
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,540
he stopped doing comedy
and he started doing some,

921
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:27,620
like I think you started doing some sort
of humanitarian work or some point that

922
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,510
there's a really nice guy.

923
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,051
He was,

924
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:30,500
um,

925
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,200
I sold that guy.

926
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
My they,

927
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:33,381
sorry,

928
00:24:33,381 --> 00:24:34,550
I switched at Dave title bar.

929
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:35,860
Oh,

930
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,693
it Davis

931
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:38,480
peer.

932
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:38,841
Honestly,

933
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:41,420
I don't even hear it was a sweet guy
or I don't even remember his act.

934
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,470
He worked at the store too.

935
00:24:42,471 --> 00:24:42,861
That really,

936
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:43,131
really,

937
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:43,964
really thin guy.

938
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,590
Real,

939
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,530
real skinny and funny.

940
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,170
I had a nice Volkswagen.

941
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:49,004
A sure Rocco.

942
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,730
Oh yeah.

943
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,110
I think that was what it was called.

944
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:51,681
No,

945
00:24:51,681 --> 00:24:52,491
not the SIROCCO.

946
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,320
Maybe it was a Shrub,

947
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:53,870
whatever.

948
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,210
It was like a Volkswagen,

949
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,780
a pretty sweet Volkswagen.

950
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,681
And I started,

951
00:24:57,681 --> 00:24:58,070
uh,

952
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,581
that's what we got.

953
00:24:58,581 --> 00:24:59,720
Like one of my first development.

954
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,913
What year was this?

955
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,810
This was 94.

956
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,540
When I first came to Hollywood Volkswagen,

957
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,860
90 to 91 or something
like that was a night.

958
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:07,680
It was a nice car.

959
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,590
I was in DC of course for
my first new car and uh,

960
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,820
I got a super turbo and so,

961
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:14,060
uh,

962
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,730
I had this other car just
laying around and you know,

963
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:17,990
Dave was telling me he needed my,

964
00:25:17,991 --> 00:25:18,201
you know,

965
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:19,810
needed a car but he
doesn't have any money.

966
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:22,670
I'm like how much money you got and you
wind up giving me like a thousand bucks

967
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:23,391
for it or something like that.

968
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:24,111
I just gave it to him.

969
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:25,400
I forget what it was exactly,

970
00:25:25,401 --> 00:25:26,260
but you know,

971
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,470
the car was worth like 10 grand.

972
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,251
Oh that's awesome.

973
00:25:28,251 --> 00:25:29,084
Just gave it to him.

974
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,620
I take it he's a nice guy,

975
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,580
but he still drives that
motherfucker and he lives in it now.

976
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:35,720
It's got 300,000 miles.

977
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:35,880
Right.

978
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,713
There is a,

979
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,640
there was a,

980
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,060
an interesting place because
of that very reason though.

981
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:45,650
It's like it didn't dent the lesson of
the comedy store was that there was no

982
00:25:45,651 --> 00:25:46,520
rules there,

983
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,490
that it was chaotic and
ridiculous and it made no sense.

984
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,750
And you know,

985
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:54,050
a guy like Eddie Griffin would go on
at nine o'clock and stay on stage until

986
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:55,040
three o'clock in the morning.

987
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,150
Like all the time.

988
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,410
It's a pool with no lifeguard.

989
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,130
It's just there's just a bunch of kids
swimming in summer jumping off the roof.

990
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,001
But because of that,

991
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:02,181
you know,

992
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:06,140
a lot of people develop that sort of habit
of just going on stage and not giving

993
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:07,250
a fuck about the clock.

994
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:08,841
And I did too.

995
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:09,950
And I'm guilty of it for sure.

996
00:26:09,951 --> 00:26:11,150
I did a lot of long sets.

997
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,680
They're doing them a favor though.

998
00:26:12,681 --> 00:26:14,390
And you're also a guy who
gave back to the club.

999
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:14,691
It's like,

1000
00:26:14,691 --> 00:26:14,901
you know,

1001
00:26:14,901 --> 00:26:16,370
there's little things
that go without saying.

1002
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:17,300
You give us a new roof,

1003
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:18,170
a new sound system.

1004
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,250
Let him run the light.

1005
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,120
Charles Fleischer would
give me a second jewel.

1006
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,120
We appointed to 40 extra minutes.

1007
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,721
Yeah.

1008
00:26:23,721 --> 00:26:23,931
What?

1009
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:25,190
He was kind of crazy.

1010
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,860
You know Fletcher says dude though he's,

1011
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,371
he's out there.

1012
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:28,650
He's like,

1013
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:28,850
he,

1014
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:29,990
he's been at the store lately.

1015
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:30,850
I haven't seen it.

1016
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:31,700
I think they banned,

1017
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,800
they banned and we catch
up every once in a while.

1018
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:34,520
They ban.

1019
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:34,761
Yeah,

1020
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:35,361
something happened.

1021
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:36,470
They stopped giving him sets.

1022
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,430
Which one of these is yours,

1023
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:37,700
man?

1024
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,533
No kidding.

1025
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,580
I haven't drank any of them saying,

1026
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,880
oh yeah,

1027
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:42,890
they stopped giving him sets something.

1028
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,910
He got pissed and he started
going over to laugh factor.

1029
00:26:44,911 --> 00:26:46,020
He's a genius.

1030
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,830
He's up really fascinating
dude to sit down and talk to,

1031
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,010
I want to get him on the podcast.

1032
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:50,941
I got his number,

1033
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:53,040
one's at a Starbucks within
my fucking blackberry,

1034
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:54,240
fell on a toilet and I lost,

1035
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,480
I lost it before I stored
it and the computer,

1036
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,000
I think I might have his number.

1037
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,990
I'll give it a fascinating character.

1038
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,590
And he's Steve.

1039
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,780
He's the voice of Roger
Rabbit for people don't know.

1040
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,633
Yeah,

1041
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,060
but he's also a scientist.

1042
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,070
You know it was in the
back of the comedy story.

1043
00:27:08,071 --> 00:27:11,010
He said he came up with some geometric
new geometric structure and been working

1044
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:12,510
on it for the last 36 days.

1045
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:12,930
Yeah.

1046
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:16,230
So working on this mathematical structure
and then the fucking brought it in.

1047
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:18,750
It was pieced together with
a little plastic cause I go,

1048
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:20,490
how long did it take you to put
this fucking thing together?

1049
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,001
He's like,

1050
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:22,380
pieced it all together himself.

1051
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:25,920
This weird multi sided geometric pattern.

1052
00:27:25,921 --> 00:27:26,220
I'm like,

1053
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:26,610
wow,

1054
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:26,901
what a,

1055
00:27:26,901 --> 00:27:27,870
what a weird guy.

1056
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,560
Very weird,

1057
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,520
but he's lived at his house,

1058
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,560
looks like nuts.

1059
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,590
He was married for a long
time and now he's single,

1060
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,220
you know,

1061
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,270
and I think the,

1062
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,810
I'm thinking he's one of those guys that
probably when his wife left the house

1063
00:27:39,811 --> 00:27:40,471
instead of crying,

1064
00:27:40,471 --> 00:27:41,304
you probably like

1065
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,080
now I can get to work and I
can't go work on my machine.

1066
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,830
I bet he has like a lave
and all sorts of industrial.

1067
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,770
It's like shit that just
dudes don't have at home.

1068
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,780
It's a lot of dudes like building things.

1069
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:55,170
Man.

1070
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,750
Adam Carolla has like a full cabinet tree,

1071
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,690
like construction set up at his garage.

1072
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,550
He's got the dopest place where he were.

1073
00:28:02,551 --> 00:28:03,900
Adam does his podcast.

1074
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:08,850
He's got a killer studio set up where
it's like couches and microphones and all

1075
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:09,031
that.

1076
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:10,140
Not a whole staff.

1077
00:28:10,141 --> 00:28:13,440
He has a staff of like when I was
there there was like five or six people

1078
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:17,220
working for him would manning the video
cameras and working the phones and all

1079
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:18,054
this different shit.

1080
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:22,680
And then he's got this back area where
he keeps his cars were also has carpentry

1081
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:26,010
equipment and he's like build
in fucking cabinets and shit.

1082
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,020
He's a strange cat.

1083
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,250
He's one of the weirdest,

1084
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,860
the weirdest become.

1085
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:32,480
I mean he is.

1086
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,590
I would consider him a standup comic now.

1087
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,990
He wasn't for a long
time and now he is again.

1088
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,890
He's one of the weirdest of
those guys because he's such a,

1089
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,920
he doesn't watch comedy.

1090
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,140
He's not a fan of comedy,

1091
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,700
but to him it's like he goes,

1092
00:28:44,701 --> 00:28:44,990
wow,

1093
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:49,900
it's easy for me to do kind
of go do it that on what?

1094
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,390
They just fucking does it.

1095
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:51,781
I never,

1096
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:52,890
I never met him before.

1097
00:28:52,891 --> 00:28:53,291
It's funny.

1098
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:53,420
Yeah,

1099
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,250
he's great.

1100
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,170
There's these guys been around forever
and ever had met Tom Arnold racing did a

1101
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:57,940
pilot with him.

1102
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,250
He was,

1103
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:58,950
he was super cool.

1104
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:59,490
I had never,

1105
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,570
I had no idea what,

1106
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:01,980
you've got to catch them
on the right mixture.

1107
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,200
You know you might catch him when he's
on some weed and he's friendly as flag

1108
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,780
gacked out and wants to cut your
fucking hard out with a fork.

1109
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,960
I don't need my heart getting cut out
with a fork cause I need to figure out a

1110
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:13,500
network.

1111
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,630
People would complain as the
audio is fucked up Brian.

1112
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,021
Yeah,

1113
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:17,420
I was getting some reverb in my hair.

1114
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:18,700
I didn't want,

1115
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,590
I'm scared to test it.

1116
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,700
All right,

1117
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,100
well that's not good because then it's
good on the MP three but that's what I

1118
00:29:26,101 --> 00:29:27,360
was playing with earlier.

1119
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,190
Well how do we know what it
sounds like on the Ustream?

1120
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,650
See the problem is this laptop doesn't
have any a headphone jack cause it only

1121
00:29:34,651 --> 00:29:36,070
has one jack for headphone.

1122
00:29:36,071 --> 00:29:37,710
He does this one have a headphone Jack.

1123
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,021
Yeah,

1124
00:29:38,021 --> 00:29:39,420
but I mean if he,

1125
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,110
if I can plug it in
there and listen to her,

1126
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:41,591
I can try.

1127
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:42,341
Why don't you plug it in here?

1128
00:29:42,341 --> 00:29:42,611
I list.

1129
00:29:42,611 --> 00:29:44,710
What do you want to interrupt you?

1130
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,750
You well I want to find
out what's going on man.

1131
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,160
Because with the last one was terrible.

1132
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,880
Apparently I get mad at me mad.

1133
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,320
You always just when you're retarded,

1134
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,790
I was just playing with the level.

1135
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,700
Totally not.

1136
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,031
Okay.

1137
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:55,960
Tell me what's going on now.

1138
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,490
Now you're listening to
and making sure you're,

1139
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,333
hold on.

1140
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:04,763
Hmm.

1141
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,500
I'm talking to you Brian.

1142
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:09,334
Michael,

1143
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,470
and so use your,

1144
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:11,891
my now is,

1145
00:30:11,891 --> 00:30:13,320
I'm getting a big spinning ball.

1146
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,750
Ustream is very nice for having
us on and all that good stuff,

1147
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:18,700
but it seems like it kind of sucks.

1148
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,620
It's a lot of complaints
about it all the time.

1149
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:21,000
Yeah,

1150
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,730
it's free,

1151
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,190
you know?

1152
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:22,870
Yeah.

1153
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:23,980
At least you don't have all the ads.

1154
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,013
I,

1155
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:28,590
yes.

1156
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,160
It's all static and stuff.

1157
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,233
Still.

1158
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:33,743
How bad the sound

1159
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,820
does it sound really bad?

1160
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,201
Check a check.

1161
00:30:37,201 --> 00:30:38,370
It sounds shit like shit.

1162
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,680
Why don't we disconnect
it from that thing?

1163
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,830
How much of a pain in the ass,

1164
00:30:43,831 --> 00:30:44,664
how long would that take?

1165
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:45,150
Well,

1166
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,040
the problem is is that
it makes no sense at all.

1167
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,980
The audio.

1168
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:50,490
Damn.

1169
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:50,761
Brian,

1170
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:51,810
we can't have this.

1171
00:30:51,811 --> 00:30:52,440
Hold on.

1172
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,340
This is 10 wait,

1173
00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:53,581
can I,

1174
00:30:53,581 --> 00:30:54,414
can I show you something though?

1175
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:58,140
Here's the audio that you're
computer's thing it sounds like.

1176
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:58,831
Yeah,

1177
00:30:58,831 --> 00:30:58,951
the,

1178
00:30:58,951 --> 00:30:59,100
the,

1179
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,270
I understand that Brian,

1180
00:31:00,271 --> 00:31:02,550
but it's going okay.

1181
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,000
This plug that's going in here.

1182
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,140
It's the same club

1183
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,043
chicken,

1184
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:10,971
Brian.

1185
00:31:10,971 --> 00:31:11,750
I don't care.

1186
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,420
What I'm saying is it
sounds like terrible.

1187
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,850
It sounds terrible for the people
that are listening on Ustream,

1188
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,090
so how do we fix that?

1189
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,550
We're going to stop.

1190
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,091
We're going to stop.

1191
00:31:20,091 --> 00:31:20,924
Won't be right back.

1192
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,171
All right.

1193
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:21,651
I'm going to stop,

1194
00:31:21,651 --> 00:31:21,990
folks.

1195
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:22,750
All right.

1196
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,583
We gotta fix this.

1197
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,010
It was like that the whole time.
