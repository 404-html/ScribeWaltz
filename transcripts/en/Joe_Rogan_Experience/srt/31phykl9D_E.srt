1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,110
You know,
are we live yet?

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,990
Right now alive,
which probably costs a shitload of

3
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:09,270
money.
We're trying to figure like riders on

4
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:12,820
the storm.
Doon Doon Doon Doon I think that would

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,020
be the best way to open a pod podcast
ever too much though,

6
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:20,080
right?
I'll talk to some people think Wheeler

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,851
Walker.
June.

8
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:21,880
Yeah.
Oh,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,690
on camera.
We're on camera with the whole deal.

10
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,600
You look fucking fantastic.
Uh,

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,440
I found out about you through our mutual
friend who turned me on to eat and pussy

12
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:33,810
and kicking ass and I was a fan right
away.

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,190
Instantly.
We're on this trail.

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,100
This is 100% legit.

15
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,140
Yeah.
I love the show.

16
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:39,974
And we,
uh,

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,490
I'm out here a fucking,
I'm not making this up.

18
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:45,920
We bought tickets for this weekend
because we were going to do

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,050
a coachella too gay.
They set,

20
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,000
the goal was we were going to do it and
they said it was too fucking x ray to,

21
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:54,700
we can't focus,

22
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,440
which was fucking bullshit to me,
man.

23
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,020
You're too risque for Coachella.
Coachella is all about taking ecstasy as

24
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:01,990
well.
I fucking thought,

25
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:02,920
you know,
it's just,

26
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,780
I dunno.
Maybe that's their excuse that you just

27
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:05,614
don't want me,
you know,

28
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,980
it could have been the nice way of
saying let's just go over the playlist

29
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:10,360
and perhaps we'll see where the hitch
is.

30
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,350
My baby,
I think I may be with them and then you

31
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:14,560
redneck shit.
I don't have any problem with that.

32
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,660
That's his name of the album.
That's easy.

33
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,830
We're banned from Walmart by the way.
That's,

34
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,210
that's applause beer.
We'd coaches.

35
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,100
That's fine.
Family tree.

36
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,750
Totally fine.
That's the dirties one though.

37
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,300
Oh really?
Can't fuck you off my mind.

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,080
So you start getting a little edgy.
Fuck you bitch ballad.

39
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,280
Drop them out.
That's easy.

40
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,510
Eating Pussy,
kicking ass.

41
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:38,170
My favorite fight and fucking farden.
That's fine.

42
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,490
Better off,
beaten off.

43
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,370
Sit on my face.
And then the Coupe de Gras.

44
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,630
Which one are you?
Queer.

45
00:01:43,631 --> 00:01:47,260
It's going to suck my Dick and man,
shit happens.

46
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,550
You get book Yo black out and go to head
to a bar.

47
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,700
Well the problem is the titles are
actually wakeling up the salt.

48
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,080
I mean,
I go,

49
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,340
no,
here's the

50
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,440
see what happens.
So I went to my buddy,

51
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,060
Dave cobb,
he's a producer there.

52
00:02:01,061 --> 00:02:02,900
I actually met him through your buddy
sturgeon.

53
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,390
Actually,
I didn't really meet him,

54
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,790
but everyone,
there's a bunch of articles that said

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,950
stars will introduce me to him.
So I'm just going with it.

56
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,940
Well it means we're in narrative.

57
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,470
I'd help.
But um,

58
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,483
so,
uh,

59
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,360
and I'd kind of been kicking around
Nashville for like about 15 years or so

60
00:02:20,361 --> 00:02:22,470
and with no success at all.
I mean just bullshit.

61
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,340
And I'd been,
had my ass kicked my dick in the dirt as

62
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:27,630
they say.
And then,

63
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:28,190
um,
you know,

64
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,921
I was like,
fuck it,

65
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:30,840
this is going to be my last record.
I was like,

66
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:34,230
I'm going to whatever they call it,
drop the mike put out a really fucking

67
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,430
dirty ass record though at record.
I was wanting to make and not pull any

68
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:40,170
punches.
I was going to just pay for my cell

69
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:43,410
phone and myself and I have a feeling
this was going to get me banned from

70
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:46,140
Nashville.
And then I just leave cause I fucking

71
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:51,141
broke.
So we made this fucking dirty record and

72
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,000
it's probably about as dirt and it's
not,

73
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:56,250
it wasn't even like I want to make the
dirties country record.

74
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,410
It was just like,
what's happened now in Nashville cause

75
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:02,320
it's turned into such fucking bullshit
is um,

76
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,140
well money's happened,
right?

77
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,670
Well what's happened is country radio is
no longer country music.

78
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,200
What is it?
It's,

79
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,950
and I didn't know this any more new
cause I don't listen to that dog shit,

80
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,550
but I um,
I actually heard the best explanation

81
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,260
for it the other day.
Steve Earle,

82
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:24,370
who's a hero of mine,
he was on this Chris Shifflet podcast.

83
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,091
I don't know if you know,
he is,

84
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:28,180
if he's a guitar player for foo fighters
is a good podcast where he interviews a

85
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:29,470
lot of country music.
He loves country.

86
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,570
Oh Wow.
And Steve Earle goes,

87
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:34,150
um,
you could say,

88
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,770
you could hear him.
He's kind of talking around it.

89
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:38,680
He goes
country today,

90
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,070
you know,
mainstream corporate country is,

91
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,200
he goes,
it's rap music for people.

92
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,460
And he pauses,
he's like,

93
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:47,410
it's rap music for people.
And he just,

94
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,150
you keep hearing him pause.
Like is he going to say it?

95
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:52,030
He goes,
it's rep people for it's rap music for

96
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,190
people who are scared of black people.

97
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,970
And he's not saying as a joke,
but I started listening.

98
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,340
He's absolutely fucking 100% right.
It's Luke Bryan.

99
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,950
Do like a duet with a rapper nail do
that if you want.

100
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,070
It is,
it's like beats and you know,

101
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,250
you said you don't some hip hop and she
is,

102
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:11,030
this is Jamie's big on the hip hop.
Yeah.

103
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:13,100
You like it's beats from,
but the thing is,

104
00:04:13,101 --> 00:04:14,660
here's my thing.
If you were making

105
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,010
good sounding like it's beats from the
eighties really soft guy with the

106
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:20,880
baseball hat,

107
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,630
he's thinking about trucks and beers and
dog shit like that.

108
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:25,550
It's the worst fucking go to the river.
Exactly.

109
00:04:25,551 --> 00:04:26,241
Yeah.
No,

110
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:29,540
it's just so,
and have you seen that compilation?

111
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,060
What's it is a compilation.
They put it all these different

112
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:34,640
musicians singing the exact same thing.
Oh yeah,

113
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,120
yeah.
Well have,

114
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,160
see,
I've heard a lot of this one compilation

115
00:04:37,161 --> 00:04:39,920
of country artists.
It's just the same song.

116
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:41,250
Yeah,
that's what I'm talking about.

117
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:42,980
That calculation.
They're all talking about being by the

118
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:45,140
river,
you're tight blue jeans.

119
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:47,540
Like there's all these like different
things that they just repeat.

120
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:48,800
I me,
it's fuck,

121
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,460
it's disgusting.
Rarely is what it is.

122
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,100
Another thing too is

123
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,770
I listened to Nwa,
I listen to public enemy.

124
00:04:54,771 --> 00:04:56,030
I listened to,
you know,

125
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,230
get a boy.
It's like I don't need to hear white boy

126
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,100
wrap.
I'll listen.

127
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,570
If I want us to know alison,
all kinds of music,

128
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:04,300
I want listen to wrap all this into
fucking rat,

129
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,430
right?
So I went in the studio,

130
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,240
I'm like,
I want to make some real fucking country

131
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:11,480
music.
And at the time I didn't know what had

132
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:12,470
happened.
And you know,

133
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,480
I'm in Nashville,
but I'm in my house.

134
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,700
I don't know what the fuck's going on.
So I,

135
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:19,910
um,
whenever I write a song,

136
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:21,920
like my first instinct is just not to
censor it,

137
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,100
you know,
why would you and I started playing in

138
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:27,410
the studio and they're like,
this guy motherfucks going,

139
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,350
I mean,
I'm fist in the chicks and going know

140
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,730
guys blowing each other and uncles,
you know,

141
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,550
implicitly and kicking ass had me
literally like cry and laugh.

142
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:38,170
Well that's one of those,
that's probably the cleanest song.

143
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,000
It's a funny song though.
Funny,

144
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,770
we were listening to playback and I go,
we listen to fuck you bitch.

145
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:48,280
Which is the,
I was gonna say the head that's the hit,

146
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,100
if you can call it a hip.
Let me a second to realize that was also

147
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,350
you,
because I saw the first one,

148
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,131
uh,
from,

149
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:55,510
uh,
the Ben Hoffman show.

150
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,513
Yeah.
Fuck that dude.

151
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,290
If you don't Ben Hoffman.
No,

152
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,900
he talked me into doing his fucking,
uh,

153
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,350
is uh,
he had a show on comedy central as the

154
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:04,820
saying goes,
I was sick that week,

155
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:06,680
so I didn't get to see it as just
fucking canceled.

156
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,940
It wasn't funny.
And He,

157
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:10,310
the dude just came off like kind of like
a cock sucker.

158
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,320
Wow.
And a strong word.

159
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,790
I don't want us to be brothers.

160
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,340
He looked exactly like,
he looked like real similar.

161
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,540
I don't think so.
But whatever,

162
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,630
you know each man,
each,

163
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,930
each to his own dude.
I'm half blind.

164
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,980
Okay,
well that's cool.

165
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,190
I was going to say I don't,
I mean I wear glasses now.

166
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,240
Um,
so I did that thing and then you know,

167
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,590
I think that's where maybe cobb or you
know,

168
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,090
cause I knew sturge we'll back in
Kentucky.

169
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:32,871
Anyway,
the point I'm trying,

170
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:35,150
I'm all over the place.
I started getting around.

171
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,790
What was interesting to me was I started
getting around through,

172
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,661
no,
no,

173
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:41,120
like big promotion.
Just people passing it on.

174
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,880
Someone would find out about it.
They'd send it to this guy and he would

175
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:45,860
send it to his friends and that's how I
got it.

176
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,720
Well that's,
it might've been stirred all the sound

177
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:48,830
to me.
It's very pop.

178
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,090
Cause every,
what had happened,

179
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:53,270
what happened was,
and kind of the main point was I was in

180
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:56,390
the studio back to what we were talking
about and I'm listening to playback to

181
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:57,200
fuck fuck you bitch.

182
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,621
And I go,
man,

183
00:06:57,621 --> 00:06:59,780
this is so pretty.
If I made it clean,

184
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:00,650
you know,
like love you girl,

185
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,400
you know,
whatever.

186
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,020
I go,
this could get played on the radio.

187
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,540
And they look at me like I'm crazy and
they go,

188
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,510
this ain't getting played on the radio.
I go,

189
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,820
why not?
They go cause it's real country music

190
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:12,410
and they don't play that on the radio
anymore.

191
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,610
Then I go,
if it's just,

192
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,920
if I can get in and get banned for
playing real country,

193
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:20,360
why not just fucking not censor myself
at all and do it fucking X.

194
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:20,811
Right.
So that,

195
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:24,830
that's what kind of convinced me just to
do it my fucking way.

196
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,140
You know.
So as someone who is a country music

197
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:30,470
artist and is a fan of country music,
and we talked about country music before

198
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:32,330
the show started,
there's,

199
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:35,390
you've got to be some hope that this
guy's like shooter jennings and

200
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:36,110
sturgeon.

201
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,290
There's an these new guys that are
coming up that are really fucking

202
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,270
talented.
That's the only hope.

203
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,490
I mean really what's happened.
Here's my thing and I've gotten a lot of

204
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,380
fuck,
I mean all the kind of mainstream,

205
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,070
it's not fucking around.
I mean like music growing happy that my

206
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,380
out,
it was grammy week when my album came

207
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:58,820
out like eight weeks ago and I out,
my album debuted at number nine on the

208
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:03,710
billboard country charts during gray
areas outsold people who are on the

209
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:07,040
fucking grammys and I'm just,
that's from a fucking few tweet and I

210
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,320
ain't got no twitter followers if I
don't even know how to use it.

211
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:14,000
Facebook and you know I sign up for
snapchat hoping to get a bunch of tea

212
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,770
cause they said that's where the tits
come in.

213
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,530
Snapchat's got,
I've gotten about the office.

214
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,920
Snapchat.
Jamie gotten 25,000 ticks.

215
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,310
I got nothing but Dixon and I've gotten
like four.

216
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:28,250
The nasties ticks you've ever seen.
Well men are disgusting.

217
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:31,430
So men take chances on guys,
a gay guy and you've got all these songs

218
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:34,110
about gay guys sucking Dick.
So like I can get this guy well that,

219
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,540
well,
the the thing they're not even doing,

220
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,250
these aren't gay guys.
These are guys who are just like,

221
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:39,380
I love your album.
I want to show you my fucking nuts.

222
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,170
And I'm like,
I guess I appreciate it,

223
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:44,270
but we should.
Someone sent me some fucking tits

224
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:45,104
already.
Geez.

225
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,720
Well I think they're coming today.
Today people are going to send you them

226
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:50,390
that aren't even going to be there.
You're going to get some fake accounts

227
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,780
bringing a shitty hug and it gives a
flat fish catfish,

228
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,990
catfish,
catfish.

229
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,010
If anyone's up,
forget.

230
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,520
Oh,
I,

231
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,970
yeah.
If anyone's up for getting cabinet,

232
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,370
it's always walker champion.

233
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,200
I'll show up with my fucking pants down.
Ready for it.

234
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,810
I'll buy anything.
You know what's funny about you and this

235
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:09,450
whole thing is that no one had to give
you the green light to do this.

236
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,060
What I love about it is that you decided
to take a chance,

237
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,430
spend your own money,
hire legit musicians,

238
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,020
put it together yourself and you're
like,

239
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:16,880
fuck it.
I'm going to have it.

240
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,550
Either I'm going to go down in flames or
this is going to take off.

241
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,880
And Dude,
I hear about you all the time now.

242
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,650
Like I don't know if you know what's
happening,

243
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,370
but there's like this wave of people who
are finding out about you across the

244
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:30,560
country.
The answer is right.

245
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,360
I didn't know.
I mean I put out the album and then I

246
00:09:34,361 --> 00:09:39,361
got a call like I said about,
you know that it's on the billboard.

247
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,360
I thought it was a fucking joke.
And then I,

248
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,280
they said that we should,
I got to go on tour and I said I ain't

249
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:46,030
going,
I'm no spring chicken man.

250
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:48,190
I ain't sitting in a fucking van and
playing empty clubs.

251
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,330
And I said call me back when we got
offers and they started getting off

252
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,580
like,
can I make my

253
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:59,000
officially it was Jamie pull up that uh,
even though I'm announcing it right now,

254
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:00,500
like,
and I got talked into,

255
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,200
you know like there's people buying,
I guess they want to buy tickets.

256
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:07,160
I don't,
nobody would have ever let you do this

257
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:09,350
10 years ago you could've noticed.
That's so funny.

258
00:10:09,351 --> 00:10:11,900
Cause you know obviously a thing,
you know,

259
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,340
here we go.
Bam.

260
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,740
Oh Shit.
It was a total tour son.

261
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,020
I'm not even kidding.
This is some of these is the first time

262
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:18,980
I seen it.
Okay,

so go to wheeler walker jr com forward
slash tour and all of these are audio.

264
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,460
You can win some serious places,
man.

265
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,310
You're doing some pretty big deals.
Tell me they don't like,

266
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,810
some of these are like,
like house of Blues.

267
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,460
Yeah.
These are several thousand blues.

268
00:10:31,461 --> 00:10:33,680
I mean they don't play,
they play everything but the blues.

269
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:36,830
But I mean those are big rooms.
How the fuck am I going to sell out out?

270
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,570
I Dunno dude.
I guess is what I'm here for.

271
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,220
I guess that's what you're here for him.
But yeah,

272
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:42,380
you're playing.
You do in the independent in San

273
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,250
Francisco.
Is that a good place?

274
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,640
It's a very nice place.
Mother fucker got some good spots.

275
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,410
Yeah.
I mean more in Philadelphia.

276
00:10:48,411 --> 00:10:50,480
That's a great theater.
I don't know why.

277
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,940
Yeah,
look at you.

278
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,400
That's hilarious.
I want to go the album come out

279
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,890
Bam.
About eight weeks.

280
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,710
So I listen.
Yeah,

281
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,100
I dunno what the fuck's going on,
but here's awesome.

282
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,300
I guess.
So I went in there,

283
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,700
this guy,
Dave Cobb,

284
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:11,701
who just won the grammy at the Preuss,
won the grammy for country producer of

285
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:16,180
the year.
And he did circles first two records and

286
00:11:16,181 --> 00:11:17,890
I knew sturgeon a little bit back in
Kentucky.

287
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:19,510
And um,
he introduced me,

288
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:20,260
he's like,
just give me,

289
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,940
I was like,
I want to own this shit.

290
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:23,590
You know,
I don't want anyone to own it because

291
00:11:23,591 --> 00:11:27,310
they're going to fuck fuck with it.
So I just gave him the,

292
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,440
like literally emptied out my bank
account,

293
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,680
gave Dave the money,
all these kind of the best musicians.

294
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,660
A lot of it was actually a lot of
shooters.

295
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,380
The guys from shooters first band who
would all move who now are in Nashville.

296
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,620
So it's like these killer player too,
I think are the best players in

297
00:11:41,621 --> 00:11:44,320
Nashville.
But they're not like Nashville's go to,

298
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,500
you know,
not like the guys at these pop dog shit

299
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:50,400
guys go to.
And it's the guys who played on Sturgis

300
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,730
first record and we,
and these guy,

301
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,130
Leroy Powell,
Chris Powell,

302
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,973
Brian now

303
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,050
Brian Allen and give him a shot.
I mean the great musician,

304
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,720
great fucking musicians live versions
that they did.

305
00:11:58,721 --> 00:12:01,300
They did.
You can have the crown live some radio

306
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:05,620
station thing with just a very small
group of them and you get to see like

307
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:06,650
how good the,
the,

308
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,070
the actual families struggles guy,
different pain.

309
00:12:09,071 --> 00:12:11,680
Now that again,
I mean fuck stretches.

310
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:14,470
Paint now as fucking uh,
is killer.

311
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,940
I mean music is so hard to pin down.
It's funny too cause you know we had a

312
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:22,490
bit of a,
we had a fallen out recently and you

313
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,970
couldn't find a bigger stars will fan
than me.

314
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:27,700
I just listened to his record on the way
over here and it's a fucking

315
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:30,850
masterpiece.
But he also won't fucking talk to me

316
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:31,690
right now.
What happened?

317
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,800
Well here's the thing,
I don't even mind talking about it,

318
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:40,620
right?
I in an interview I said that he was in,

319
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,720
but this is honestly what I believe.
I think he is.

320
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,640
And you're going to laugh when I say it,
but I swear this is what I fucking

321
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:50,900
believe.
I think he's a paid ca.

322
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:55,510
Assess.
I'll just let that sink in for a second.

323
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,440
I think he's taking motherfuckers out
and I confronted him about it.

324
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,420
What did you uh,
get this information?

325
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,480
Well,
let me tell you the video.

326
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,380
None of them.
See I'm not,

327
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,730
like I said,
I knew him back and get,

328
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:09,430
and Tuckey
and he goes,

329
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,590
is this fucker goes to the navy.
Right?

330
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,820
Right.
Imagine,

331
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,630
imagine being,
imagine he's,

332
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,470
he's worked for the governor.
Imagine being in the navy and you look

333
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:19,210
next to you.
And some guy just picked up a guitar and

334
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:22,750
started singing and it sturgill Simpson.
Imagine that,

335
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,930
right?
There's no fucking way,

336
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,200
like the greatest singer,
guitarist,

337
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,060
one of the best ones in the world right
now.

338
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:28,960
Would you agree with that?

339
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,530
Oh,
for sure.

340
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,870
He's just sit next to you on a fucking
boat and he decides,

341
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:33,970
you know what,
I want to leave the navy when he was

342
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:35,260
young.
But I'm saying,

343
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:38,110
you can't just quit the navy,
uh,

344
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,130
what you do,
you term.

345
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,600
You know,
he didn't do his term.

346
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:42,040
He fucked it left.
Brilliant.

347
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,140
So He owes the gum.
How long did he go?

348
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,910
I don't know the fuck.
Listen,

349
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,370
all my facts aren't together.
I kind of find me alive.

350
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,990
But he leaves.
Can you do that?

351
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,830
I thought that's like you go awol.
He didn't go awol.

352
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,780
He's fucked.
So why is it,

353
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,270
I'm saying,
why is he fucking out?

354
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,040
Oh,
well you should talk to her house Jones

355
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:57,701
about that.
Well,

356
00:13:57,701 --> 00:13:58,400
no,
but I'm telling.

357
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,010
I know I'm not,
I don't need to talk to him.

358
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:00,920
I got the answers.
Okay.

359
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:01,990
He leaves.
Right?

360
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,830
Right.

361
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,340
Now
he all of a sudden out of nowhere,

362
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:10,120
he just puts out the fucking wreck.
So if you're in the government,

363
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:12,080
you want to take some fuckers out,
right?

364
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,270
But their dick in the dirt.
Look,

365
00:14:13,271 --> 00:14:15,040
I'm saying,
take those motherfuckers down.

366
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,370
What's the best way to do it?
And this done,

367
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,080
but may have been done before,
but some,

368
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,410
some other Hollywood stars,
your guest country music artists alive

369
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,480
and you show people for you.
Well,

370
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:25,741
no.
Yeah,

371
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:28,390
as a front.
But who travels the most Christian music

372
00:14:28,391 --> 00:14:28,831
artists?
Yeah.

373
00:14:28,831 --> 00:14:31,270
And you gotta have them legit cause he's
got to go fucking play right?

374
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,800
Checkout surgicals tour.
Now,

375
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:35,340
here's what I'm going to say right now.
I know you're laughing at I,

376
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:39,190
you both laughed at him,
but this motherfucker,

377
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,740
his toured Europe.
Fucking 10.

378
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,600
He's polite.
He's toured England 10 times.

379
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,970
You ever heard?
Who's your favorite country music

380
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:46,804
artists from England?

381
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,280
They don't listen to fucking country
music.

382
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:50,380
They don't listen to it now.
You don't play and listen to it.

383
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:52,460
He's going over there fucking killing
people and,

384
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,900
but this fucker gone to how many times
you eat a lot.

385
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,480
Do you ever met a Japanese guy and you
go,

386
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,620
who's your favorite country?
Ours.

387
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,530
They don't go,
uh,

388
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,510
you know,
they don't go,

389
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,470
oh fuck a hot dog do.
I can tell you you'll call them.

390
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,150
They don't listen to that shit.
He's over there taking motherfuckers

391
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,170
out.
You go down his tour list and you could

392
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:12,200
check the,
check it with the papers of enemies of

393
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:14,900
the state who have been taken out.
That shit fucking lines up,

394
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:18,410
does it?
I think I wasn't the specifics.

395
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:19,640
I can't.
Anyway,

396
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,300
I got a little stone and I thought this
was what happened and I should have

397
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:24,800
asked him about it,
which is true,

398
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,330
but so he just started accusing him of
being a CIA has done to his face.

399
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,790
I did it on a couple of radio shows and
then,

400
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,340
and this is probably going to break it
open a little bit,

401
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:35,750
but anyway,
now he's,

402
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,200
he won't.
Why will he confront me about it?

403
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,500
Because it's true.
Right?

404
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,730
And why is this new album all about him?
You heard the record.

405
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,420
It just him talking to his son because
he's seeing shit at night.

406
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,650
He,
he's seen the shit,

407
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,600
you know,
why do you write up an album about this?

408
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:57,740
Serious about doing as like a serious
talk to your child because you've seen

409
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,400
shit go down.
You've seen motherfuckers [inaudible]

410
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,430
he's tells loves his kid.
No one does it.

411
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,110
No,
that's not a reason to make a record.

412
00:16:06,111 --> 00:16:08,810
He says he's telling his kids warning
him don't do what I did.

413
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,290
You know,
and he's a hired government assassin and

414
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:15,640
I'm almost positive about this and we're
in the it,

415
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,150
but I'm also getting the truth out
there.

416
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,520
Don't you worry,
he's going to take you out for exposing

417
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:20,510
them.
That's what I'm talking about it.

418
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:22,430
Because now they know if he takes me
out,

419
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,530
we'll know then my story will be true.
That's what their gut thought in Russia.

420
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,570
Remember that dude in Russia?
They was talking shit about,

421
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,250
uh,
about Putin.

422
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,860
He was a political rival,
the Putin.

423
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,740
And he thought because he was so public,
they'd never take them out.

424
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,280
They shot him with his girlfriend while
he's with his girlfriend.

425
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,290
They shot him in front of a government
building.

426
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,330
Let doesn't help my fucking hang tight
with the store.

427
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,810
They'll just get you,
dude.

428
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,240
You go to Russia,
don't tour Russia.

429
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,260
I don't know.
Well,

430
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,270
I mean again,
I,

431
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,180
I'm,
my facts aren't like a 100% together,

432
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,460
but from what I've seen,
why wouldn't he talk to me about it?

433
00:16:58,461 --> 00:17:00,380
Then you say,
well,

434
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,570
you know,
people get testy when you call him

435
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:03,404
killers.

436
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:04,723
They get,
um,

437
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,020
you know,
they feel bad.

438
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,401
I don't know,
man.

439
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,090
Yeah,
you guys.

440
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,410
I mean,
whatever.

441
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:11,090
I think I'm onto something,
but whatever.

442
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,130
Anyway,
that's the thing about country music.

443
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:16,250
You live with some friends,
but that 10 taking apart what I that I

444
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:18,860
think he's a hired government killer.
Take that away.

445
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:24,080
Take that away for the moment.
But what you're saying about those guys

446
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:24,830
like surgery,
it's,

447
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,750
it's,
it's bringing real country.

448
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,120
It's actual country music.
He didn't play on the radio.

449
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,340
Jason Isbell to dark guy.
Man.

450
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,080
I've been listening to a lot of his shit
lately.

451
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,090
He's amazing.
He's fucking great.

452
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,410
That's the guy who did.
The Guy Dave who did his records did

453
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:41,900
mine too.
There's a lot of great stuff coming out

454
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:44,150
right now and what,
see,

455
00:17:44,151 --> 00:17:47,180
this is the thing though.
It seems that

456
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,160
music are a lot

457
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,630
like television producers in that what
they want to do is sell the most shit

458
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,870
and like some of these people,
they're not necessarily there.

459
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,390
It's not that they're not artists.
They're definitely artists.

460
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:04,110
They're creating music,
but the creating music that they

461
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:08,070
specifically want to sell a lot,
they want it to hit with people.

462
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:11,370
It's almost like they want to figure out
how to press those buttons,

463
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:12,390
right.
You know,

464
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:15,930
they want to put it in a nice juicy
formula when they get press those

465
00:18:15,931 --> 00:18:16,710
buttons,
right?

466
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:21,710
And you'll sell a lot of units,
but a guy like sturgeon or a guy like

467
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:24,330
shooter jennings,
like these guys are not doing that.

468
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,330
What they're doing is expressing
themselves and then you get to find out

469
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:30,630
who they actually are.
And it's so much more interesting than

470
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:33,180
the same canned bullshit.
And the same can bullshits fine

471
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:35,490
sometimes.
I mean sometimes I like listening to

472
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:38,580
some stupid pop music song just for the
fuck of it.

473
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:40,440
Who Cares?
It's not the worst thing in the world.

474
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,840
I think that's fine too.
But my,

475
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,400
my actual might even bigger,
not even bigger issue,

476
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:47,640
but speaking like I like fucking pop
music just like you,

477
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:52,110
but the country pop his fucking 20 is 30
years is there,

478
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,870
I don't mind.
Like sturgill is a good example of

479
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:57,600
someone who's taken country and moving
it forward.

480
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,760
These guys aren't,
they're adding beats from like the

481
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:01,590
eighties and they're,
they're going backwards.

482
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,453
You know,
they're trying,

483
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,910
I know people who go into studios of
major country artists with one of those

484
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:09,300
fucking clickers clicker things and
making sure it's the right is not made

485
00:19:09,301 --> 00:19:10,860
up.
Making sure it's the right beats per

486
00:19:10,861 --> 00:19:11,880
minute.
So slow it down,

487
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:13,440
speed up to make sure we get on the
radio.

488
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,650
So my goal with my record,
it's in that fucking crazy.

489
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:20,790
That's weird that like,
that's you imagine someone coming in

490
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,920
here with one of those clickers.
It speed up or slow down your Po,

491
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,410
like you fucking kick him out of the
room.

492
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,410
Well we've talked about this a hundred
times.

493
00:19:27,411 --> 00:19:32,030
Like if we actually had a network or a
producer or an executive behind the

494
00:19:32,031 --> 00:19:35,000
showed it never worked.
No one had never let us do any of this

495
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:36,860
stuff.
How would it had arguments with people

496
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:38,420
every day about some of the things we
say,

497
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,260
hey tell totally.
And that's why the podcast so great and

498
00:19:41,261 --> 00:19:43,090
so big and a lot of these pots,
you know,

499
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,380
it's,
it's a natural reaction when like,

500
00:19:47,381 --> 00:19:49,480
you know,
radio turns to shit.

501
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,700
Yeah.
Podcast had to happen because people

502
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:54,640
were sick of bullshit radio in the same
thing with country.

503
00:19:54,641 --> 00:19:56,920
I went,
basically my goal was I said,

504
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,810
I gave him cash.
I said,

505
00:19:58,811 --> 00:20:00,610
no one's touching this,
and I said,

506
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,790
I'm going to make the best country
record of the year and I'm going to make

507
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,880
it completely unplayable.
I don't want it to be able to be played

508
00:20:06,881 --> 00:20:08,390
anywhere.
So when you're making out Mike,

509
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,190
that you're literally only listening,
you're not thinking outside the room.

510
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:16,270
You recorded it because the assumption
was nobody was going to fucking hear it.

511
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,390
So when you make an album that you
assumed,

512
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:21,490
nobody's going to hear it.
It's an interesting shit kind of

513
00:20:21,491 --> 00:20:22,130
happened.
Yeah,

514
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,390
got it.
Got fucking dirty.

515
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:25,510
You don't get me wrong.
I mean it went fucking x rated,

516
00:20:25,511 --> 00:20:26,800
but it's fun,
man.

517
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:30,190
It's fun.
And what you said was true to like 20

518
00:20:30,191 --> 00:20:31,630
years ago,
1510 years ago,

519
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:33,460
this would have to be sold in the back
of a Nudie Mag.

520
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,470
It's on Itunes,
it's on Amazon.

521
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,311
It's not,
like I said,

522
00:20:36,311 --> 00:20:37,040
it's not Walmart.

523
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,100
You had to give it to people and they
would have had to start talking about

524
00:20:40,101 --> 00:20:42,050
it.
And then there was a few a warrant

525
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,920
there,
few like dirty albums or guys would sink

526
00:20:44,921 --> 00:20:45,540
dirty

527
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,960
his back.
And David Allan Coe,

528
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,320
the most famous,
I actually opened up to shows for David

529
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,410
Allen Coe.
And he's dirty.

530
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,341
No,
no,

531
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:53,590
he's a legit country artist and it's
actually a real story.

532
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:54,311
It's interesting.
He,

533
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:56,710
um,
Shel Silverstein was a,

534
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,910
the writer,
a country,

535
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,220
you know the kids children's book
writer,

536
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:03,970
but he also wrote country music.
He wrote boy named sue for Johnny Cash.

537
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,430
Somebody told me that.
That's true.

538
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,750
That's true.
He ain't,

539
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:10,030
he's recorded here and there.
So David Allan Coe was playing these

540
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:13,030
really dirty,
these really dirty songs for Shel

541
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,863
Silverstein.
And he goes,

542
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:19,350
you got to record this shit.
And I got a great record label.

543
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:20,470
I can't,
you know,

544
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,720
I can't,
this is the seventies I can't record.

545
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:23,620
I mean,
we're talking

546
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,250
should I would,
I mean like,

547
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,620
I consider myself an equal opportunity
offender and I'm a David Allan Coe fan.

548
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:33,400
I mean,
no disrespect,

549
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,270
but it's,
you know,

550
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,510
70 he's used as for f and I don't think
he's a racist because it comes up a lot.

551
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:38,410
But he used the n word,
you know,

552
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:43,060
it gives crazy shit and those decks,
but it was sold and he recorded it

553
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:46,600
obviously off the radar and it was sold
in the back of backer mags,

554
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,210
you know,
and those albums they got to me and

555
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:49,911
Kentucky,
you know,

556
00:21:49,911 --> 00:21:52,980
like they get around but it was just,
it was a different machine behind him.

557
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,390
Well do you remember the Jerky Boys?
Yeah.

558
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:56,820
Yeah.
Do you remember they had a,

559
00:21:56,821 --> 00:21:59,070
there was a cassette that you would get
from people.

560
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,950
That's how we all got the Jerky boys.
I remember getting that in Kentucky.

561
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:04,500
Just like you got to hear this part.
Cause we all used to do prank calls.

562
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:07,290
Like you got to hear this shit.
I think those guys did that shit all on

563
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,380
their own and put the thing,

564
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,790
didn't they do a movie?
You probably won't go mainstream,

565
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:15,110
but it went south there.
But again,

566
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,920
but what you're saying is totally right.
Like,

567
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,940
and now you've got word of mouth.
That's how you ended up on the billboard

568
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:24,120
charts is when you got word of mouth
plus the Internet,

569
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,750
which is instead of town 10 French,
you're actually telling a thousand

570
00:22:27,751 --> 00:22:30,480
friends and we're outselling,
you know,

571
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:35,850
my album came out the same week as a new
Wynnona judd record and sold more copies

572
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,550
and I'm from Kentucky and I got nothing
against,

573
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,470
I've got nothing against the judge,
by the way.

574
00:22:40,471 --> 00:22:42,320
Did I tell you I got in a twitter fight
with Wendona.

575
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,560
Whoa.
For Real?

576
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,410
Yeah.
Which one's the actress at her sister

577
00:22:46,411 --> 00:22:47,930
Ashley.
Well known.

578
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,720
Uh,
looks like,

579
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,670
uh,
to Ashley's put together.

580
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,170
I don't rude.
Um,

581
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,460
yeah,
that's not nice of me to say.

582
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,050
I don't like these La Women.

583
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,350
I should say that.
You like them thick.

584
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,050
Yeah.
Like it could have been like a moral

585
00:22:58,051 --> 00:22:58,741
third.
Yeah.

586
00:22:58,741 --> 00:23:02,070
I don't like these girls to too because
it's like the old days,

587
00:23:02,071 --> 00:23:05,020
you know,
if he said girl is skinny healthy.

588
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,530
Yeah.
It was a sign of that in the like those

589
00:23:07,531 --> 00:23:09,120
fat kings in the old days,
you know,

590
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:12,030
or like they let them let you know that
they had fucking money.

591
00:23:12,031 --> 00:23:14,610
You and I see a girl is skinny.
I think they're just using me for food.

592
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,610
What if women think that way?
They see a guy was real thin.

593
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,550
Like to they,
they want a guy with a gut secretly.

594
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,030
They don't want to talk about it with
corn.

595
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,470
What I've seen in La,
yeah,

596
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,040
what he wants.
I mean these geese,

597
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,410
girls look hungry.
There's a lot of hungry girls and all

598
00:23:28,411 --> 00:23:29,610
that.
They are hungry.

599
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,770
Well they been told that they have to be
a fucking coat rack in order to be

600
00:23:32,771 --> 00:23:33,870
famous.
Guys don't like,

601
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,130
well not only that man,
watch television.

602
00:23:36,131 --> 00:23:38,530
Other companies like watch a television
show in Columbia.

603
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,920
All the girls have these big thick ass
legs,

604
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,170
big asses and big tits.
They don't look anything like American

605
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:46,190
women and that's what fucking we whack
off

606
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:51,190
to X.
Like I've never googled skinny chicks on

607
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,940
my fucking oh but healthy.
I hate to bring it back to me,

608
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:58,460
but please do.
It goes,

609
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:02,420
but it goes to what we're talking about.
You're doing everything the opposite

610
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:03,254
way.
So I go,

611
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,720
so a lot of these albums nowadays,
like you know,

612
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:07,760
they'll do those,
they'll stream,

613
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:09,560
you know,
do a free stream the week before it

614
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:12,230
comes out on NPR or rolling stone or
wherever it was.

615
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:14,120
And you know,
no one play my shit of course.

616
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,100
So I go,
let's um,

617
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,640
let's premiere the um,
the record on um,

618
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,920
on red tube.
No,

619
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,440
what,
which one was it like a porn site?

620
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,810
Yeah,
Porno Porn.

621
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,010
Pornhub was the one I did go porn hub.
I go,

622
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,230
let's,
let's stream down for free for the first

623
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:35,540
week on porn hub.
All right.

624
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,000
I think maybe,
listen,

625
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:38,600
don't get me wrong.

626
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,250
Most people who went to porn hub that
week,

627
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:41,990
we're looking to hear a country music
record.

628
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,801
Right?
But still,

629
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:44,330
you get 1% of that.
They,

630
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,830
they're whack off.
And we knew I'm lacking off.

631
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:48,200
Listen to a good fucking record.
They had ads for my record.

632
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,760
No one's read.
I was like,

633
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,370
they basically said to me like,
let's just try it out and see what

634
00:24:52,371 --> 00:24:53,900
happens.
And they were so totally fucking cool

635
00:24:53,901 --> 00:24:57,260
about it.
It's like when you're looking for cause

636
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:58,940
this like,
they're like talking about these like

637
00:24:58,941 --> 00:25:02,240
you know nprs app.
Oh it's at 10,000 people like,

638
00:25:02,241 --> 00:25:04,510
how'd you like to reach every fucking
man on earth?

639
00:25:04,511 --> 00:25:05,630
Who Wax off?
I go,

640
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:06,980
yeah,
that sounds interesting to me.

641
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,020
That sounds like an audience I'd like to
get him with.

642
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,510
Do you ever look at ads when you whack
off though?

643
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,920
I had not.
I don't even know what.

644
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,770
Here's my theme and notice them.
I go full screen immediately.

645
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:18,680
Now my theory though is when you might
face is up there and you're whack.

646
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,980
If you just right when you see my face,
you ain't forgetting that face for the

647
00:25:21,981 --> 00:25:23,270
rest of your fucking life.
Good point.

648
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,600
You have a very distinct look and then
the,

649
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,440
if you like,
went to like a video that you really

650
00:25:27,441 --> 00:25:29,540
enjoyed and then your face was off to
the side of it.

651
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:30,650
It could get confusing.
We yell,

652
00:25:30,651 --> 00:25:32,900
it's a click.
It clicked right to the fucking record.

653
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,790
Yeah.
That's like some Manchurian candidate

654
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:35,511
type shit.
Yeah,

655
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:37,310
that's how I'm thinking.
I'm thinking sturge we'll lock here

656
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,480
dude.
I see what you're saying.

657
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,930
Like you just get in their head like,
yeah cause every,

658
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,700
I wonder like what are the real raw
numbers?

659
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,010
Like how many people jerk off to those
porn sites?

660
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,740
Well they,
I mean they told me they was like the,

661
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,990
it has to be insane.
It was hundreds of,

662
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,520
you know,
it was literally hundreds of millions.

663
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,250
Well they're like,
you know it was,

664
00:25:55,251 --> 00:25:56,620
isn't that fucking crazy?
They're like,

665
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:00,080
what's crazy is it's in the dark.
If there was any other fucking website

666
00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:02,570
that had hundreds of millions of hits,
we'd be talking about it all the time.

667
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,530
Exactly.
Well that's the thing.

668
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,960
They gave me their numbers and they were
just like,

669
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,780
they weren't even that,
cause they know the numbers.

670
00:26:07,781 --> 00:26:09,710
So to them it's not a big deal.
They're like,

671
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,440
I go help.
Like compare yourself to other sites.

672
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,620
Like what's it like compared to
craigslist was only thing.

673
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:17,640
I said they go,
oh we're bigger than craigslist.

674
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,600
What about CNN were bigger?
It's CNN.

675
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,520
I go,
wow,

676
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,650
this guy's combined.
Why the fuck am I is am I the only one

677
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:27,830
thinking to put to fucking put ads on
pornhub?

678
00:26:27,831 --> 00:26:29,810
And they go,
because the corporations won't.

679
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,030
This is back to me paying for it,
knowing that myself,

680
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,840
I go,
I can do whatever they want.

681
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,380
We've asked a movie studios,
you've asked the record companies,

682
00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:39,500
they won't fucking put ads on our
fucking sites.

683
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:41,120
And I go,
I'll fucking do it.

684
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,740
That's because,
and I go and they who do you have to

685
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,690
talk to to do it?
And I go,

686
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,760
you're talking to the fucking guy.
You know?

687
00:26:47,761 --> 00:26:48,930
That's the whole,
don't have people.

688
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,030
That's the whole love of the whole great
thing about doing this legacy.

689
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,840
But you must have people swooping in on
you now because of what we're talking

690
00:26:55,841 --> 00:26:59,170
about earlier that Nashville right now,
I don't want to say it like I'm a

691
00:26:59,171 --> 00:27:01,390
fucking investigator.
I've been studying Nashville.

692
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,413
He was like,
she,

693
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,940
you know the big picture,
that's money.

694
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,000
It's just like television shows.
If you want to watch those terrible two

695
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:10,030
and a half men style television shows.
Why do you think they're making those

696
00:27:10,031 --> 00:27:11,410
things?
Because people are buying them.

697
00:27:11,411 --> 00:27:14,050
They're gobbling them up.
There's a certain frequency that you can

698
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:17,200
hit when you make like really dull,
bland stuff.

699
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,360
And people like that.
There's a lot of people that like that.

700
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:20,950
And so they know how to do it and they
bang it out.

701
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,980
And I think that's what's happening with
producers,

702
00:27:23,981 --> 00:27:27,130
but it's not what the public wants.
And that's why you're getting these

703
00:27:27,131 --> 00:27:32,131
shows like mad men or you know,
walking dead or you know,

704
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:35,260
the,
the game of thrones,

705
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,860
you're getting these interesting shows
that are so much different than all

706
00:27:38,861 --> 00:27:42,190
these formulaic bullshit shows that had
been on television forever.

707
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,470
And because people were changing.
They have to,

708
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,680
they have to adapt to the fact that
people have too many options now.

709
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,710
They don't have to just eat your spoon
fed bullshit.

710
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,230
Totally.
I mean,

711
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,600
that's,
that's like,

712
00:27:53,601 --> 00:27:54,434
uh,
you know,

713
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,510
listen,
and the girl who dumped me,

714
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,890
and I'm telling you she's not a bitch,
but when she left my,

715
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,690
and in my head,
I'm thinking,

716
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,210
fuck as any guy would fuck you,
bitch.

717
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,460
I go,
why do I have to cover up that emotion

718
00:28:07,461 --> 00:28:10,490
that I felt after the song for some
fucking record label?

719
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,600
So I just sang,
fuck you.

720
00:28:11,601 --> 00:28:14,300
But of course everyone that's the
studious guys are playing drums.

721
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:16,910
Like what the Fuck's wrong with this?
Is that video have on Youtube?

722
00:28:16,911 --> 00:28:17,990
It's something insane.
Oh,

723
00:28:17,991 --> 00:28:18,850
it's not that.
I mean,

724
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,570
we're still at the very beginnings.
I mean,

725
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:24,140
what's so crazy is,
you know the amount of records I sold,

726
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,380
these rooms I'm playing,
we still only reached a friend because

727
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,120
you know,
there's just for eight weeks,

728
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:29,690
man.
Yeah,

729
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,250
it's prettier.
But there's this band Florida,

730
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,410
Georgia line who by the way,
just blocked me on twitter because I was

731
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:34,480
talking so much shit about it.

732
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,570
Florida,
Georgia,

733
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,680
Florida,
Georgia line,

734
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,940
George.
And they're one of the,

735
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,620
one of the bigger acts and country.
And listen,

736
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:43,760
I'm sure they're not.
I heard later,

737
00:28:43,761 --> 00:28:47,340
they were nice guys after I ripped on
him for fucking nonstop for fucking,

738
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,770
you have 72 hours.
But I don't give two fucks about making

739
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,320
fun of this bullshit pop country that I
call,

740
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,120
you know,
that I talked about before.

741
00:28:56,121 --> 00:28:58,790
So I'll fucking rip on there.
That pop country,

742
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,220
they have to,
I had a wallet chain until recently.

743
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,390
Okay.
Listen to,

744
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,400
I mean,
don't you tell me right now those dudes

745
00:29:04,401 --> 00:29:05,640
ain't about to attack each other off.

746
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,430
They're trying to get some pussy.
They look good.

747
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,370
I look to shave their arms.
Hold on.

748
00:29:09,371 --> 00:29:13,150
Go back to that Jamie.
These are you guys trying to get pussy

749
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,350
the guy in the over his right shoulder?
No,

750
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,370
that guy's not good pussy.
But in his defense he might've already

751
00:29:18,371 --> 00:29:20,280
gotten some pussy or he might be in the
devil.

752
00:29:20,281 --> 00:29:21,600
He's in post pussy.
Yeah,

753
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,710
he could it be like,
I just nodded so hard today.

754
00:29:23,711 --> 00:29:26,260
I don't care about fuck,
I just want to eat some cheetos and take

755
00:29:26,261 --> 00:29:28,230
a nap.
That's very possible.

756
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,770
Yeah.
I mean that's the guy at the right.

757
00:29:29,771 --> 00:29:31,000
Doesn't know what the fuck's going on.
The Guy,

758
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,920
the far right with the glasses with a
gray shirt.

759
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,650
He's just like hoping one day talking to
Max.

760
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,810
He just wants to the checks to cash.
Yeah.

761
00:29:37,811 --> 00:29:39,340
He's hoping one day it's all gonna make
sense.

762
00:29:39,341 --> 00:29:40,840
But right now he's baffled.
He's like,

763
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,070
is on the right.
Here's

764
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,260
the thing,
if it makes people happy and people like

765
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:45,840
this fucking crap,
hey,

766
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,733
he's,
you know,

767
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,190
I liked their medallions but the fake
soldiers,

768
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,150
I got nothing against it,
but I'm also the only fucking dude in

769
00:29:52,151 --> 00:29:55,090
Nashville talking shit about,
about him and Sam Hunt,

770
00:29:55,091 --> 00:29:58,560
this guy who fucking wraps and you know,
why does that guy have a dog tag on and

771
00:29:58,561 --> 00:29:59,650
go back to that please.
Jamie,

772
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,580
he's got a diamond and crusted dog tag.
That should be,

773
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,390
that's like some stolen valor shit.
Maybe he works for us.

774
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:12,391
Yeah,
I mean that is the exact opposite of

775
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:17,050
what a fucking dog tag is.
A dog tag is aluminum and it represents

776
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:21,880
a memory of someone who died in the war.
This is a dog tag shaped diamond

777
00:30:21,881 --> 00:30:23,590
encrusted thing.
This is,

778
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,810
this is hilarious is the real dog tags
aren't diamond and crest.

779
00:30:26,811 --> 00:30:28,930
Is that what you're trying to,
so I'm trying to say this is the,

780
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,380
I mean this is literally like the devil
is selling us a band.

781
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,300
It really,
but this is the thing.

782
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,360
This is what they're selling.
So you wonder why I'm pissing off music

783
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:37,721
row.
Well,

784
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:42,280
here's a reason because that fucking
bands has blocked wheeler walker jr on

785
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:43,870
twitter.
It's probably someone handling their

786
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,980
shit,
whatever it is.

787
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,900
And again,
I've heard they're nice enough guys,

788
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:50,170
but there there's people writing the
music for him there.

789
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,540
The people producing it for him.
There's a,

790
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,180
sure,
let me just use him as settings.

791
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,990
Let me just say in broader terms,
listen,

792
00:30:55,991 --> 00:30:58,600
I don't another thing he knows other
thing reason I think people dig me cause

793
00:30:58,601 --> 00:31:00,550
I don't give a fuck if I'm saying it's
too,

794
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:05,110
I just say the shit.
But the pop country dog shit that's on

795
00:31:05,111 --> 00:31:06,910
country radio with Florida,
Georgia line,

796
00:31:06,911 --> 00:31:08,830
same hunt and all this other shit.
I mean listen,

797
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,680
listen to some of it.
I don't know what it sounds like.

798
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,250
It sounds like what's Steve Earl said?
It sounds like the guys they're

799
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:16,870
dreaming.
I think you're hating.

800
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,540
Fuck yeah mate.
I'm trying to sell record.

801
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:21,700
Go back to him.
Jamie who get the one with the gold

802
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:24,430
bullion.
He's got a gold bullion around his neck,

803
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:26,620
some shit.
Columbus took over in the Santa Maria.

804
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,410
Go back to them.
Another one,

805
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:32,080
the original picture that you had.
And while these guys are beautiful,

806
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:35,430
there he goes,
look at the gold bullion handsome.

807
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,540
They look like they'd be wonderful to
hang out with.

808
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,320
And you think those two guys know what's
locked to have loved and lost.

809
00:31:41,321 --> 00:31:43,570
And those guys hadn't been down that
dirt road,

810
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:46,090
sir.
They've got their fingers dirty and

811
00:31:46,091 --> 00:31:47,950
everything.
They have hand sanitizer in their back

812
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:49,720
pocket right now.
No,

813
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,600
ain't no,
ain't no girl dumping those dudes with

814
00:31:52,601 --> 00:31:55,630
those blue gold crusted madame bomb.
Girls are crazy.

815
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,730
They don't even appreciate what's in
front of them.

816
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,810
You want to hear that?
No,

817
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,210
you want to hear some fucking,
uh,

818
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,410
you know,
some heartbreak you listened to me.

819
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:04,630
Not these two fucking good looking dude.
Well,

820
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,180
for heartbreak music,
I would say the dude with the red and

821
00:32:07,181 --> 00:32:10,060
black striped shirt is not going to give
you what you're looking for.

822
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,601
Yeah,
probably not.

823
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:11,560
I wonder if he,
I don't think he's,

824
00:32:11,561 --> 00:32:14,050
I think it's just the two dudes he
wishes he was in the cure,

825
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,670
but they're not taking anybody new.

826
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,650
You know what's funny?
I'll bet the two guys in the front.

827
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,370
I'll bet Damian Ammann he met the band.
I would if they become my favorite band

828
00:32:24,371 --> 00:32:25,990
though.
Like we're talking all this mad shit,

829
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:28,420
but I haven't listened to the music.
What if we play their music right now?

830
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:29,171
And I'm like,
Oh my God,

831
00:32:29,171 --> 00:32:31,290
I love them and I'm fucking,
I'll see you later.

832
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,460
You just leave Ali.
No play.

833
00:32:33,461 --> 00:32:34,840
Can we hear some?
Well,

834
00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:35,651
I've got to tell you.
Oh,

835
00:32:35,651 --> 00:32:36,610
you get in trouble?
Yeah.

836
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,530
Yeah.
We'll probably get pulled from youtube,

837
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:39,470
right?
How do do this?

838
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,370
Uh,

839
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,720
you know what?
How about this?

840
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,940
They say a little bit,
just not play a little tube.

841
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:45,380
Can't hear it.
Okay.

842
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:47,390
Youtube.
Anybody listening to on Youtube?

843
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,150
What's the song?
Just tell us what the song is,

844
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,250
but the people on the podcast can hear
it,

845
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:53,090
right?
Is that how it goes?

846
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,130
The first one that popped up is called
confession.

847
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,480
Jamie might have to do some editing.

848
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,690
We're going to get polled.
Can't be use ash.

849
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,560
We're going to call called confession.

850
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,810
It's weird.
Here we go.

851
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,930
Florida,
Georgia Line Confession,

852
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,490
7 million million golf.
7 million views.

853
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,910
Now compare that to Sturgis.
Just keep,

854
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:21,680
I keep playing.
This guy's keeping it real.

855
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:28,863
Now hear that.
Hear that?

856
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,540
That,
that the drum or whatever that is.

857
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,440
Yeah.

858
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,750
Oh,
that beat the rap.

859
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:36,680
Yeah,
he's doing Rambo.

860
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:37,523
He's rapping

861
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:40,791
now.
You tell me.

862
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:42,590
This is country music.
Honestly,

863
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:46,890
it's weird.
It's pop music like it's like a poppy

864
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,680
poppy.
Yeah.

865
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:50,840
They're doing a lot of hip hop movements
with their hands.

866
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,970
It's all like they're stealing from
black people.

867
00:33:52,971 --> 00:33:55,370
It's cultural appropriation.
Tony should end it.

868
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,780
We should end.
Listen,

869
00:33:56,781 --> 00:33:59,690
white people have never stopped stealing
from black people.

870
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,090
They're not going to stop.
They're moving into country music.

871
00:34:02,091 --> 00:34:02,924
Was He right though?
It's,

872
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:03,763
it's,
it's,

873
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:04,700
it's,
yeah.

874
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,920
It's wrapped for people who are scared
of black people.

875
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:08,810
That's 100% rav.
For people that are scared of black,

876
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,610
catchy tune,
it probably sold.

877
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:13,070
Well,
obviously we'll fucking more than me,

878
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:14,060
but I'm not,
like I said,

879
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:17,060
I'm the only one who's,
and what you were saying,

880
00:34:17,061 --> 00:34:19,850
people coming at me,
which has been happening some,

881
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:22,610
but for the most part,
they don't want to piss off the real

882
00:34:22,611 --> 00:34:24,890
money maker so they don't want to be
associated with that.

883
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:30,390
It seems like there's a lot of country
music that's sort of reinforcing of

884
00:34:30,391 --> 00:34:35,391
mindset and so one of the only music
genres that reinforces a mindset and

885
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,180
that mindset is,
I'm a simple person.

886
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,850
I got a nice truck,
I got a good dog,

887
00:34:40,851 --> 00:34:42,950
I got a woman,
but someone broke my heart.

888
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:44,900
Or maybe I love you,
maybe I'd die for you.

889
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,650
There's like all these like really no
bull and really,

890
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:53,660
uh,
really like iconic like country music

891
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:59,840
themes and,
and a iconic country music ideas that

892
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:02,570
get pushed in these and they just get
repeated over and over and over again.

893
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:06,560
It's reinforcing the benefits of living
in a rural environment.

894
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,040
It's reinforcing being near nature and
rivers and shit like that.

895
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:15,041
But it's also reinforcing being dumb.
It's reinforcing like God got to have

896
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,420
God involved.
There's a lot of God involved and

897
00:35:17,421 --> 00:35:19,220
there's some of that shit that I
listened to.

898
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:21,110
Why go?
This can't be real.

899
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,810
I don't think surgical simpson is a CIA
assassin,

900
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,420
but I've listened to some country music
songs where I go,

901
00:35:26,421 --> 00:35:29,270
okay,
this is a fucking cyber plot.

902
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:32,030
This is the government is trying to
figure out how to get into people's

903
00:35:32,031 --> 00:35:33,860
minds and make them dumber.
Well,

904
00:35:33,861 --> 00:35:37,200
the other thing too is as a guy from
[inaudible] and I'm with you 100% right,

905
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,300
but seems like it totally

906
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,920
it,
it feels like it was made to brainwash.

907
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,080
It's a psych psych,
psy ops.

908
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:45,840
Is that what they call those things?
The government's just created super

909
00:35:45,841 --> 00:35:49,110
popular music that enforces the idea of
being stupid.

910
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,540
Totally.
But also as the guy from Kentucky,

911
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,390
I grew up in Kentucky,
must my family from Tennessee and it

912
00:35:54,391 --> 00:35:57,450
makes me look like a fucking dumb ass
that like this is what people,

913
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,750
this is not what the south is.
I got a lot of really all my friends are

914
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:02,760
from itself.
It's great man.

915
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:03,900
Yeah,
it's all the best for me.

916
00:36:03,901 --> 00:36:06,060
You know it's the fucking great
greatest,

917
00:36:06,061 --> 00:36:07,740
but you see this and that's what
reinforced,

918
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:11,100
not only say cultural appropriation,
it's reinforcing stereotypes.

919
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:12,750
So I'm going in there and making some
real,

920
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,510
what?
I actually would have less of a problem

921
00:36:15,511 --> 00:36:17,400
if they just didn't,
if they just called that pop music,

922
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:18,450
it's pop music.

923
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,100
Why Co?
Because they're given an act.

924
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,220
It's pop music with an accent and that
accent is what makes it country.

925
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,470
But it's also,
they don't,

926
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,410
there's very little bragging.
It's not like hip hop.

927
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,750
Hip Hop is like a lot about bragging,
you know,

928
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:33,020
there's a lot of like,
yeah,

929
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,430
there's a lot of what I'm going to do to
use a lot of what I own.

930
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,120
What am I gonna do to your girl?
You have a totally,

931
00:36:39,121 --> 00:36:41,160
this is,
this is like your rice together with you

932
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:42,090
forever.
Yeah.

933
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,270
I never going to leave you.
I appreciate you.

934
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,160
And they're backstage,
you know,

935
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:51,640
fucking dual blow bang guys.
Jank you jacking each other off the 69

936
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,470
spinning in a circle.
That's the tweet that got me blocked to

937
00:36:54,471 --> 00:36:55,310
think.
Yeah,

938
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,660
that'll do it.
They're probably not.

939
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,530
They're probably nice.
Guys.

940
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,290
I heard they were nice guys,
but it has nothing.

941
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,670
And if they are listening,
which they're not,

942
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,710
but it's a great job.
I'm sure they're happy,

943
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,900
they get 7 million.
But it's not that,

944
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:10,710
it's not them personally,
it's just that machine that Nashville is

945
00:37:10,711 --> 00:37:15,711
putting out that I'm so against.
And I decided that it pisses me off that

946
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,490
it's that country music,
which I love so much and I love,

947
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,440
but that's not the stuff we've been
talking.

948
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:23,460
You know,
my heroes,

949
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:26,790
waylon and willie and Johnny Cash,
Johnny Cash and Merle just passed away

950
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:28,800
and like the Louvin brothers just passed
away.

951
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,610
Um,
Louvin brothers or banner do what this

952
00:37:32,611 --> 00:37:34,260
country do.
I use to love and they're singing about,

953
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,510
they had to sell him.
Satan is real and almost looks like a

954
00:37:36,511 --> 00:37:37,980
joke where they're sick,
but it's like,

955
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,540
but they're serious.
They're serious.

956
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:40,760
Satan is real,
but they're real.

957
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,690
But they're,
but they're talking about,

958
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,650
you know,
the struggle of the devil versus like,

959
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,740
that's interesting to me.

960
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:47,620
Like,
okay,

961
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,950
yeah,
they know I'm not,

962
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,640
you know,
I don't,

963
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,470
you know,
it's hard to sing sing when I sing and

964
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:53,730
talk about that.
But if they're talking about the

965
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:56,400
struggle between the two sides and then
maybe I can listen,

966
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,880
but if you're just talking about this,
this is pop music.

967
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:02,670
It's ain't country.
So that's why I decided not to censor

968
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:04,620
myself on the record.
It's like if I'm going to duke real

969
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:06,750
country and ain't going to get played on
country radio,

970
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:08,940
no matter what I do,
it doesn't matter anymore though.

971
00:38:08,941 --> 00:38:13,350
It does it.
I mean did you please check this,

972
00:38:13,351 --> 00:38:15,750
cause I'm not sure if it's true.
Some of the comedy store was saying that

973
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,150
CBS is unloading all of its radio
properties.

974
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,480
They are a,
I've heard they're currently exploring

975
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:24,320
options on what to do with their stuff.
I don't know that it's officially how

976
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,980
well how can we,
who would be listening to,

977
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,270
nobody listens to the radio.

978
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:30,840
It sounds like shit.
It's not nearly as good as a CD or an

979
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:31,740
MP.
Three in your car.

980
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:33,660
Right.
How's that hd radios that,

981
00:38:33,661 --> 00:38:34,950
okay.
I've never heard of it.

982
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,060
It like if you,
this is radio show,

983
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,410
what would I be on here for two and a
half minutes and it would be censored.

984
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,950
You can't talk about the record and then
we would have to say traffic brought to

985
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:47,740
you by pet code.
You have a cute little dog or a kitten

986
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,620
cut up,
had co get 'em ground up murder that I'm

987
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,760
lost.
We'll be right back.

988
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,200
Uh Yeah,
we'd have to,

989
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,710
I've done a couple of those because it's
country radio literally won't have me

990
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:58,270
on.
So I did a couple of rock of

991
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,770
terrestrial,
whatever they call it,

992
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:01,570
rock stations because they were kind of
into it.

993
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:05,200
So he's got a new album called redneck
stuff,

994
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,440
you know,
it's like they can't even say it.

995
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,650
So then people,
it doesn't even help me cause they go on

996
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:10,690
Itunes,
they can't find the name of the record.

997
00:39:10,691 --> 00:39:12,820
What do you remember that Cee Lo Green
Song?

998
00:39:12,821 --> 00:39:15,400
Fuck you,
that they turned into forget you and

999
00:39:15,401 --> 00:39:18,880
they kept kept going.
You knew you would hear it somewhere and

1000
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:20,260
you would go,
you fucking,

1001
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,180
why did you make a second version of
this?

1002
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,260
What did you do?
Well,

1003
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,660
that's my thing is I've been asked the
other thing,

1004
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:28,030
which you know,
you kind of getting to,

1005
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:32,080
I have been asked many times to make
censored versions of these songs.

1006
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,510
And I wrote and I wrote back to me
owning it.

1007
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,920
No,
it ain't happening.

1008
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,510
I can't believe that.
Talk Cee Lo and know it.

1009
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,240
Well that's,
but when you're on a major label and

1010
00:39:40,241 --> 00:39:41,650
you're,
and they're paying for all your shit,

1011
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,320
you know?
Yeah.

1012
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:42,761
You're,
you're on.

1013
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:44,350
She got to do when you're on tour.

1014
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,540
And that's the other thing when I was
talking about,

1015
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:49,810
I aint touring until I got an audience,
but like someone like him and he's on

1016
00:39:49,811 --> 00:39:52,000
tour,
the giant band and the record companies

1017
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,420
front and the bill,
but he's got to end up paying it back.

1018
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,380
It's okay.
Yeah.

1019
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,820
You're going to put out the censored
version.

1020
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,750
Yeah.
But if you're not,

1021
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,753
uh,
you know,

1022
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:03,070
if no co giant corporations behind me
like the,

1023
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,290
this is all,
you know,

1024
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,420
this is my label.
I could take it off the market today if

1025
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:08,560
I want to do,
I'm not going to,

1026
00:40:08,561 --> 00:40:10,870
cause this is,
I'm on a big podcast here and I want to

1027
00:40:10,871 --> 00:40:12,640
sell some stuff wreck,
but I could,

1028
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,200
you know,
well,

1029
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:16,390
I think what,
what's happened with this is a lot,

1030
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:20,170
there's a lot going on on the Internet
with people just making stuff and

1031
00:40:20,171 --> 00:40:21,004
selling stuff.

1032
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,500
Just whatever it is.
Whether it's like there's,

1033
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,600
there's people that are doing like Louis
Ck is doing that.

1034
00:40:25,601 --> 00:40:29,530
Horace and pete show.
What'd he say on stern that he fucking

1035
00:40:29,531 --> 00:40:32,080
did you hear about that?
Spent all his money making his horse and

1036
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:35,170
pete show himself when he sell and run
his website just because he wanted to do

1037
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:37,600
it,
but also he wanted to do it himself.

1038
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,080
He said,
why don't have nobody involved just so

1039
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,500
they get it all himself.
That's really,

1040
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:42,820
it.
Wasn't that the same thing with your

1041
00:40:42,821 --> 00:40:45,220
pocket?
Isn't that the lesson really is if,

1042
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:49,000
why not only do things if you're willing
to put up your own fucking money,

1043
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:51,040
two and a half men or what you were
talking about,

1044
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:52,660
that kind of shit.
Oh fuck yeah.

1045
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:53,590
Make it three.
If I'm,

1046
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,800
if the whole thing's a bust,
I s I lose zero.

1047
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,060
Well,
if this is a bust,

1048
00:40:58,061 --> 00:40:58,870
I lose a lot of money.

1049
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,850
You lose money if your podcast goes up,
you know,

1050
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:03,280
it's also,
they make it seem so easy.

1051
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,590
Like if you're going to do a record with
some major label,

1052
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,610
they're going to take care of
everything.

1053
00:41:06,611 --> 00:41:08,410
We let her,
don't you worry about a thing guys at a

1054
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:10,330
big saw,
cigars going to get in the elevator with

1055
00:41:10,331 --> 00:41:13,000
you and bring you up to the top floor.
You're going to glad hand a bunch of

1056
00:41:13,001 --> 00:41:14,920
people were really behind this record.
Wheeler,

1057
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:16,390
we love you.
Oh my God,

1058
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,070
I'm a fan.
I listen to your stuff in the car.

1059
00:41:18,071 --> 00:41:19,940
I was crying laughing.
Ha Ha.

1060
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,970
One are performing.
We'd like to see it when you're coming

1061
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:24,070
to town,
just total bullshit.

1062
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:26,370
You,
you leave and then another guy goes in,

1063
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:28,580
they do the same fucking thing.
They don't really give a fuck about you

1064
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,080
hope that you'll make some money and
they'll kind of protect me.

1065
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:33,610
Maybe they like you,
but most likely they liking me.

1066
00:41:33,611 --> 00:41:34,444
It's not

1067
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,880
to,
ain't got nothing to do with it.

1068
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:39,530
Because when they heard the record and I
went to the top of the top of those big

1069
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:42,830
brokers,
cutting companies and I sat there and

1070
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,870
they loving it,
it's blah blah blah.

1071
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:45,681
But all,
you know,

1072
00:41:45,681 --> 00:41:50,420
we got to cut this song and we got it.
Take this line out and I the second they

1073
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:53,000
said that I just sit in the room fucking
deal.

1074
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,000
You know,
you know I took the meetings,

1075
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,240
I figured it's worth taking.
You know,

1076
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:58,670
I'll listen to them.
But that's,

1077
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,420
and I will tell you this and this is a
credit to the producer Dave,

1078
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:07,010
when he told me,
told me how much it costs and listen,

1079
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:10,120
it was pretty much all the money I had,
but it was not a cre.

1080
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,780
The amount of money that it cost to make
a record in 2016 is not that much

1081
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:15,380
fucking money.

1082
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,880
When you look,
when you look at it,

1083
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:22,020
right to sell years fucking the labels
will make it cost a million by charging

1084
00:42:23,031 --> 00:42:24,890
you all that fucking bullshit.
And you know,

1085
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,200
ordering pizzas everyday that you don't
want and you know,

1086
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,850
hiring all these big gun players and
shit,

1087
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,750
people are making albums on their
fucking compete.

1088
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:33,830
It doesn't,
it don't cost shit.

1089
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,560
You know,
I went a little higher but it,

1090
00:42:35,561 --> 00:42:37,850
even that my jaw dropped when he told me
the prize.

1091
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,860
It was,
and I don't want to say,

1092
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:41,780
you know,
say the number,

1093
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:45,130
but it was how come?
Because I don't want to put him in,

1094
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,520
you know,
like I don't want people to come to him

1095
00:42:46,521 --> 00:42:46,791
like,
oh,

1096
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:51,791
you charged him so and so and all that.
And also since then he's also his last

1097
00:42:51,891 --> 00:42:53,480
director.
I mean he's sold millions of records

1098
00:42:53,481 --> 00:42:55,310
since then,
so as I'm sure it was price is going up.

1099
00:42:55,311 --> 00:42:57,530
But,
but he's also,

1100
00:42:57,531 --> 00:42:59,030
I'm not sure if some,
if he loved it,

1101
00:42:59,031 --> 00:42:59,900
an artist,
he'd just,

1102
00:42:59,901 --> 00:43:03,150
he'd record them for fucking free.
But if he's some of the big label,

1103
00:43:03,151 --> 00:43:04,610
you know,
he'll take whatever you know,

1104
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,500
well,
aren't music producers and a lot of

1105
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,660
ways,
a lot like musicians and that they love,

1106
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,360
they enjoy making good stuff.
And I know a lot of musicians,

1107
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,690
they'll do each other's albums.
They essentially do it for free.

1108
00:43:14,691 --> 00:43:16,610
They go and they'll do a cameo on each
other.

1109
00:43:16,611 --> 00:43:17,410
Shit.

1110
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:19,360
I mean,
yeah,

1111
00:43:19,361 --> 00:43:22,420
I mean I can't say enough.
I almost feel guilty mentioning him

1112
00:43:22,421 --> 00:43:24,040
cause he's,
you know my,

1113
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,770
you know how he does some good shit that
so no,

1114
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:27,604
I don't want to,
you know,

1115
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:30,970
talk about him producing it is dirty
shit.

1116
00:43:30,971 --> 00:43:35,380
But he did such a fucking amazing job
when he's such a music fan that he knows

1117
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,930
and he's kind of from the south.
He said this,

1118
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:41,350
I've noticed that people like that.
People I sturge Joel shooter,

1119
00:43:41,351 --> 00:43:44,950
we all had the same kind of music was
same kind of upbringing,

1120
00:43:44,951 --> 00:43:49,951
which was grew up in the south country
music everywhere and you're like fuck

1121
00:43:50,081 --> 00:43:51,880
this,
I'm not listening to friends in low

1122
00:43:51,881 --> 00:43:54,220
places or whatever.
You start listening to Zap when you

1123
00:43:54,221 --> 00:43:56,380
start listening to rock and you start
going to all this other,

1124
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:58,780
it's all the exact same thing and then
you come back to

1125
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:04,300
weigh on didn't become oil until that he
was late thirties at least like that.

1126
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:06,010
That's not music for kids.
You know,

1127
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:09,730
there's a reason why I didn't get waylon
when I was 11 and you get older and you

1128
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:12,250
listen to it and you're like,
now I fucking get you.

1129
00:44:12,251 --> 00:44:14,470
Come back around to it.
And that's what happened to a lot of me

1130
00:44:14,471 --> 00:44:18,970
and my friends.
Like this is as real and as fucking

1131
00:44:18,971 --> 00:44:20,290
dark.
And as you know,

1132
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:25,520
as a bare bones is any fucking Zeppelin
I ever heard.

1133
00:44:25,521 --> 00:44:26,530
And I love Zeppelin too.
You know,

1134
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:30,610
it's the same shit,
but that kind of shit is not available

1135
00:44:30,611 --> 00:44:32,400
anymore.
It's legit.

1136
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,550
It's a legit,
if it's a rock song,

1137
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,720
the black keys are legit.
You know,

1138
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:39,300
there's bands that are just legit.
You listen to their shit and just go

1139
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,490
wow.
And then there's stuff that you listened

1140
00:44:41,491 --> 00:44:45,210
to that even if you enjoy it,
you know it's heavily produced and

1141
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:48,450
someone created it in a pot factory and
it just doesn't,

1142
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:52,390
it doesn't hit you the same way.
And the crazy thing is too is like you

1143
00:44:52,391 --> 00:44:54,930
listen to someone like you really got to
see,

1144
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:58,770
and I hate to use it,
but like I know sturge we'll just

1145
00:44:58,771 --> 00:45:00,720
example we're using,
you got to see him alive because

1146
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:03,520
nowadays they can make anybody sound
the,

1147
00:45:03,521 --> 00:45:06,540
he doesn't use second auto tune,
but when you see him alive you go,

1148
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:08,640
Holy Shit.
He was just singing on the record.

1149
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,600
Yeah.
I could sing.

1150
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,410
You know,
I could go sang some auto tune.

1151
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,540
Yeah.
With the audit cut up.

1152
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,370
You got the look,
you got everything.

1153
00:45:14,371 --> 00:45:16,770
You knew some like Peter Frampton ship
and when we used to do,

1154
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,290
do you feel like I do,
he was like the first guy to use auto

1155
00:45:19,291 --> 00:45:20,590
tune.
Wasn't that auto tune?

1156
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:23,580
I think that was a different thing.
A voco you know that thing with the

1157
00:45:23,581 --> 00:45:24,600
guitar?
Like no,

1158
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,920
I don't think that was up to you,
but I mean,

1159
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:29,461
no,
I've had,

1160
00:45:29,461 --> 00:45:30,870
what was it called?
The talk box.

1161
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:31,960
Talk Box.
All right,

1162
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:34,740
James.
I had a friend who worked who,

1163
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:37,890
who uh,
auto tune a major country pop star.

1164
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,070
Whoa.
And he said my voice was fucking better.

1165
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,410
Congratulations.
And I said who looked better and I

1166
00:45:43,411 --> 00:45:45,150
didn't.
I won't tell you that you don't get a

1167
00:45:45,151 --> 00:45:46,470
response.
Well,

1168
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:50,820
I think there's nothing wrong with
making those two and a half men shows.

1169
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,470
There's nothing wrong with what we're
talking about.

1170
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:57,420
But as far as like what interest me,
I'm not interested in those poppy songs.

1171
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,300
It's just,
it goes in my head and my head just

1172
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:01,410
starts rejecting it.
Like,

1173
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:02,400
oh,
you're eating plastic.

1174
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:03,400
Get it out of there.
You know,

1175
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:06,360
it's like you could,
you could live for like a few days off

1176
00:46:06,361 --> 00:46:09,720
of hostess cupcakes if you wanted to.
You could probably live for a month.

1177
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:11,610
Oh,
but just hostess cupcakes.

1178
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,770
I wouldn't recommend it though.
Yeah,

1179
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,330
I would.
I would definitely not recommend that.

1180
00:46:15,331 --> 00:46:16,640
I mean,
that'd be fucking your,

1181
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:18,630
your brain.
Your brain would probably fucking,

1182
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:20,550
you probably have no,
no protein,

1183
00:46:20,551 --> 00:46:22,470
no vitamins.
How long could you live off hostess

1184
00:46:22,471 --> 00:46:24,120
cupcakes?
That's gotta be the equivalent of just

1185
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:25,650
going without food.
Right.

1186
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,990
There would be a really interesting
experiment.

1187
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:28,910
Yeah,
they should do that.

1188
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:31,270
We could do that red band,
red band,

1189
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:31,990
be willing to do that.

1190
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,360
That's supersize me guy.
He did.

1191
00:46:33,361 --> 00:46:34,530
Oh,
he just said fast food.

1192
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,730
He did fast food,
but if someone just eight hosts,

1193
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:39,090
a lot of people just eat fast food.
That didn't really count.

1194
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,210
That's normal.
Yeah.

1195
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:41,610
Well,
some people.

1196
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,421
Amen.
I don't know.

1197
00:46:42,421 --> 00:46:47,130
People have criticized that show.
That movie supersize me like all of his

1198
00:46:47,131 --> 00:46:48,450
liver damage,
all that stuff.

1199
00:46:48,451 --> 00:46:49,440
They were like,
come on.

1200
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,520
Yeah.
Well I remember he like,

1201
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:53,550
he threw up on day one a festival all
the time.

1202
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:56,010
You don't fucking Barf,
but he wasn't saying it's Vegan or

1203
00:46:56,011 --> 00:46:56,701
something.
Before that,

1204
00:46:56,701 --> 00:46:59,130
it was like super healthy.
Before that was a Vegan chef or

1205
00:46:59,131 --> 00:46:59,780
something.
Yeah,

1206
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:02,430
but also I always get pissed when I see
you moving like that and they're like

1207
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:06,510
any in conclusion,
fast food is not good for you.

1208
00:47:06,511 --> 00:47:06,961
I'm like,
oh,

1209
00:47:06,961 --> 00:47:08,910
thanks.
Anymore fucking brain busters.

1210
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:09,721
Well,
not only that,

1211
00:47:09,721 --> 00:47:11,280
they say don't,
don't need it every day.

1212
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,900
Yeah.
You're not supposed to eat it every day.

1213
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,720
That fast food is supposed to be a
guilty thing that you eat when you got

1214
00:47:15,721 --> 00:47:18,360
no time to do anything else.
Like you want to just pull on the Burger

1215
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:18,571
King.
All right,

1216
00:47:18,571 --> 00:47:19,404
fuck it.
Let's do this.

1217
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:22,200
That's what it's supposed to be.
Twice a year you get hung over and you

1218
00:47:22,201 --> 00:47:24,300
go to fucking Jack in the box.
Above is fine.

1219
00:47:24,301 --> 00:47:25,230
It's no big deal.
They don't,

1220
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:28,950
the people that aren't like thinking of
slinging health food,

1221
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,793
you know?
Yeah.

1222
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,260
Well they're trying to catch up to that
now though.

1223
00:47:32,261 --> 00:47:35,550
You see like Mcdonald's has salads.
What's,

1224
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,720
imagine how nasty that is.
Oh my God,

1225
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:39,220
their salad.
What does it tastes like?

1226
00:47:39,221 --> 00:47:40,790
Like Fukushima letters?
What if it,

1227
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:42,820
what if it was like the best salad
you've ever had?

1228
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,560
It's,
it's possible.

1229
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,180
Yeah,
it is totally possible.

1230
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:46,960
Like you just don't want it.

1231
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,520
Like that's,
there are new,

1232
00:47:48,521 --> 00:47:51,480
a sponsor on your fucking show.
Yeah.

1233
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,020
Yeah.
Have you ever had any big corporate

1234
00:47:53,021 --> 00:47:54,250
sponsors on here?
No.

1235
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,920
No.
I prefer to do it the way we're doing it

1236
00:47:56,921 --> 00:47:59,680
to mostly companies that sell things
only online.

1237
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,780
Well that's squarespace and stuff like
that.

1238
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:02,330
Oh,
we,

1239
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:05,560
I think the website development company
I've got,

1240
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:08,540
I've gotten emails from,
I think they do my website well,

1241
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:11,740
you can make your own website on them.
It's super easy to do.

1242
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:16,120
But there's like a lot of companies that
they're using the internet now and using

1243
00:48:16,121 --> 00:48:17,350
podcasts,
the sponsors,

1244
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:20,680
because they don't have to have a store,
they don't have to have like a retail

1245
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:23,830
place and have to have a bunch of
employees that were an Abercrombie and

1246
00:48:23,831 --> 00:48:26,380
Fitch spray.
They can just sell stuff online.

1247
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:30,970
I think someone was telling me at the,
at the place that distributes the record

1248
00:48:30,971 --> 00:48:33,940
that
80 more or something,

1249
00:48:33,941 --> 00:48:38,290
more percent of my albums sold have been
itunes and Amazon because people can't

1250
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:39,220
find,
there's no way to,

1251
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,100
the stores aren't carrying.

1252
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,590
Yeah.
And now one can find it.

1253
00:48:41,591 --> 00:48:43,510
And when I was a kid and when you were a
kid,

1254
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:46,300
if you,
even if word of mouth got to you about

1255
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:47,590
this record,
you couldn't buy it.

1256
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,630
You went in Kentucky.
I went to the record store.

1257
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:52,030
I remember I want,
someone was telling me about the velvet

1258
00:48:52,031 --> 00:48:53,350
underground.
I got to go here,

1259
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:56,950
velvet underground.
So I went to this local record store and

1260
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,030
uh,
in,

1261
00:48:58,031 --> 00:49:00,130
uh,
in Lexington and uh,

1262
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,170
they look it up in the catalog.
Like,

1263
00:49:02,171 --> 00:49:03,940
yeah,
it'll be four weeks and we'll get it to

1264
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,870
you.
He be like four weeks to hear what this

1265
00:49:05,871 --> 00:49:08,680
band sounds like.
And then he had a high from a catalog.

1266
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:09,260
Yeah,
he'd be,

1267
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:12,760
they had a catalog of all every record
cause no one in there's buying it.

1268
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:14,110
So why would they order it?
Wow.

1269
00:49:14,111 --> 00:49:16,750
So you have to order it and then you
just have to buy it and listen to it

1270
00:49:16,751 --> 00:49:17,740
because you're not going to hear it
anymore.

1271
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:20,320
That's what we're asked to me is the big
thing has changed music.

1272
00:49:20,321 --> 00:49:21,790
Like I used to again,
I was,

1273
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,210
you know,
even Lexan,

1274
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:26,590
which is not that small of a town.
You're an island.

1275
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,660
Rarely.
So you would get rolling stone.

1276
00:49:28,661 --> 00:49:32,020
You read about like the Jesus Lizard.
I don't know if you remember that band

1277
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:33,220
really hardcore.
They were really cool.

1278
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:36,870
And I remember the guy writing about the
Jesus Lizard in Rolling Stone said it.

1279
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,900
They're like,
the real,

1280
00:49:37,901 --> 00:49:40,540
at least is not a joke.
These fuckers are fucking crazy.

1281
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,620
And it's the craziest music.
Whenever they said got me wind listened

1282
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:45,760
to it.
Nowadays you read that you don't need

1283
00:49:45,761 --> 00:49:47,800
the article,
you just click on the fucking music.

1284
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:51,700
Right.
But I had to wait weeks to fucking hear

1285
00:49:51,701 --> 00:49:53,830
that shit.
You can't press on the fucking article

1286
00:49:53,831 --> 00:49:57,550
and it's like the mystery of it's gone.
But that being said,

1287
00:49:57,551 --> 00:49:59,320
the positive is that I can actually sell
my,

1288
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:02,290
my record fucking m street.

1289
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:05,710
It's all positives to me.
You can sell your record also that like,

1290
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:09,490
like people could start talking about
you through twitter and facebook and

1291
00:50:09,491 --> 00:50:12,250
things along those lines and it just
spreads across the whole country like

1292
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:12,851
that.
Well,

1293
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:16,340
can you imagine even 10 years ago or if
not more like,

1294
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,940
like I'm,
I'm banned from Walmart.

1295
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,330
Imagine getting that call 10 years ago.
You're gestating devastating.

1296
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:24,340
This wasn't even,
it's like a divorce.

1297
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:26,320
It doesn't even matter.
Of course you're going to be banned from

1298
00:50:26,321 --> 00:50:28,430
Walmart does honor.
Yeah.

1299
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,190
I think they probably use just like they
just,

1300
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,310
they probably band 50 other records.
Yeah.

1301
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:35,480
Band.
So much shit.

1302
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:37,400
But there's this whole,
what you are talking about,

1303
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:38,450
all this shit,
they feed you.

1304
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,580
There's,
and listen,

1305
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,590
it ain't going to sell a million fucking
copies,

1306
00:50:42,591 --> 00:50:44,960
but there's people that,
there's a section of,

1307
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:49,190
you know the audience that wants real
shit and they put a section of the of

1308
00:50:49,191 --> 00:50:50,870
your of people are sick.

1309
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:53,900
I'm sick of the fucking radio.
I just want to hear Joe Talk to somebody

1310
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:55,370
in a fucking conference and you just
listen.

1311
00:50:55,371 --> 00:50:57,530
I'm sure you still do radio promote
shows and shit like that.

1312
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:01,010
You don't need started to collect Kevin
and bean cause they're friends.

1313
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:01,830
Oh yeah,
no I didn't.

1314
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:03,850
They're a,
they're a charity thing.

1315
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:06,440
They're awesome.
Most of the time I'm not doing that much

1316
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:06,920
right.
Anyway,

1317
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,500
that's awesome.
See I talked too much already.

1318
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:11,450
I don't want to talk more,
but that's all.

1319
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:13,160
First of all,
I'm jealous,

1320
00:51:13,161 --> 00:51:15,530
but then the second of all,
it's awesome that you got a big enough

1321
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:17,540
platform that you can,
you don't have to do it.

1322
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,520
Yeah,
it's super fortunate,

1323
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,920
but I mean it's not that I didn't enjoy
doing some radio,

1324
00:51:21,921 --> 00:51:23,960
but the problem is for us,
it's in the morning.

1325
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:26,510
Like for me,
it's always at like six o'clock in the

1326
00:51:26,511 --> 00:51:27,920
morning or seven o'clock in the morning.

1327
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,360
Oh,
you're preaching to the converted.

1328
00:51:29,361 --> 00:51:30,710
I'm like,
I'm not going to get up.

1329
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:32,060
I've had to,
you know,

1330
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:36,680
get up at seven to do fucking radio idea
that you can only listen to it at a

1331
00:51:36,681 --> 00:51:41,330
specific time is so fucking stupid.
Like you don't have to do that anymore.

1332
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:43,150
We have a way better way of getting
stuck.

1333
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,140
So funny you said that.
So I'm so dumb.

1334
00:51:45,141 --> 00:51:49,550
It's like who are they fooling?
Like why?

1335
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:52,370
Why do you think like podcasts would
have,

1336
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:54,080
we're going to happen no matter what
happens.

1337
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,460
If it was just bad,
I don't know who fucking started,

1338
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,110
but it had to happen because people want
to listen to what they want and what to

1339
00:52:00,111 --> 00:52:02,420
do and when you fucking get startup your
car again,

1340
00:52:02,421 --> 00:52:04,110
you want to listen to where you left
off,

1341
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:07,010
left off and it just syncs up to cart.
Rocket Science.

1342
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:07,521
No.
Yeah,

1343
00:52:07,521 --> 00:52:11,360
you get it with one press of a button.
I can go to the my podcast.

1344
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:14,690
I can go to the podcast APP and itunes.
I look at the the podcast,

1345
00:52:14,691 --> 00:52:15,081
I said,
oh,

1346
00:52:15,081 --> 00:52:16,310
we were walking junior,
boom,

1347
00:52:16,311 --> 00:52:18,290
I touch it.
I can do all this at a red light.

1348
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:21,320
And then my car,
the light turns green.

1349
00:52:21,321 --> 00:52:23,480
I start driving and I'm listening to you
like that.

1350
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,850
It's just so easy and murder.
The old days you'd go,

1351
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,560
Oh,
stern a interviewed Chris Rock.

1352
00:52:28,561 --> 00:52:29,870
He missed it.
Why?

1353
00:52:29,871 --> 00:52:31,760
What are we leaving?
How did I miss it?

1354
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:34,760
Like that's no,
that's not the world we live in anymore.

1355
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:36,470
You know,
so fucking get with the time.

1356
00:52:36,471 --> 00:52:38,690
So there's a lot of people still
clinging onto the old,

1357
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,570
you know how things you like,
like you said,

1358
00:52:41,571 --> 00:52:44,000
people need to watch a show at a certain
time or listen to the radio,

1359
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,240
like drive time.

1360
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:45,950
Right.
What the fuck?

1361
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:48,070
Who listens to radio on the fucking
drive and the will,

1362
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,810
the first thing that switched it up with
Sirius Xm,

1363
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,940
cause when serious,
when it was x Sam,

1364
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:55,070
you know,
and a opie and anthony were on and

1365
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:58,100
Howard stern's on what they figured out
when they were doing this.

1366
00:52:58,101 --> 00:52:58,934
Or it's like,
look,

1367
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:02,870
we don't have to have any censorship.
We could say whatever the fuck we want.

1368
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,200
But they started getting in trouble too.
Like opie and Anthony got banned off the

1369
00:53:06,201 --> 00:53:08,960
air once because they brought in a
homeless guy and he started talking

1370
00:53:08,961 --> 00:53:13,010
about banging Condoleezza Rice.
Oh I didn't,

1371
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,570
I did open anything.
They were cool.

1372
00:53:14,571 --> 00:53:17,090
I didn't want of them,
but it's not opening anthony now opiate

1373
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:21,180
and Jimmy Anthony's got his own thing
now he's got,

1374
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,460
yeah,
he got care radio.

1375
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,980
But I remember it was funny too because
I think you're right

1376
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,140
about that.
Sirius Xm was one a big thing.

1377
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:30,990
Cause I remember when hat on stern who I
used to listen to,

1378
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:31,471
who,
by the way,

1379
00:53:31,471 --> 00:53:33,750
I lived in,
let's do later because Kentucky,

1380
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,200
my home town didn't have stern going on.
But I started listening to him and I

1381
00:53:37,201 --> 00:53:40,510
loved him and the city is going to sell
like radio where can say wherever it

1382
00:53:40,511 --> 00:53:41,970
wants and they're like,
well,

1383
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:44,160
he's not going to be as funny.
Half the fun is listen to him trying to

1384
00:53:44,161 --> 00:53:46,380
talk around and then you listen and you
go,

1385
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,980
that's such a fucking,
it's so much fucking funny.

1386
00:53:48,981 --> 00:53:51,010
Or when he's not.
He's just saying it.

1387
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:53,480
That idea that it's,
it's more fun to be censored.

1388
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:57,460
Love when people proof theory's wrong.
You know that's a dump theory though.

1389
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,430
That's like,
didn't you hear that all the time?

1390
00:53:59,431 --> 00:54:00,610
I heard that all the fucking time.

1391
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,580
Never heard that I see here that about
comedy,

1392
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:06,110
but I was always like whatever.
Sam kinison and Richard Pryor,

1393
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:08,730
my all time favorites.
Like how the fuck can you tell me who's

1394
00:54:08,731 --> 00:54:09,780
funnier?
And Richard Pryor.

1395
00:54:09,781 --> 00:54:10,441
I mean,
it was funny.

1396
00:54:10,441 --> 00:54:13,740
The Richard Pryor and how could you tell
me that beating around the Bush would be

1397
00:54:13,741 --> 00:54:15,660
better than what prior was doing?
You can't,

1398
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:18,240
you can't say you have to be quiet and
maybe it was more in the south,

1399
00:54:18,241 --> 00:54:19,074
but I kept hearing,
you know,

1400
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:22,260
now that he's not got like the FCC to
fight against and he can,

1401
00:54:22,261 --> 00:54:24,330
you know,
the fun was him trying to get around the

1402
00:54:24,331 --> 00:54:26,640
census and he really listened to it and
you go,

1403
00:54:26,641 --> 00:54:29,510
it's so much fucking better now that you
know shit.

1404
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:32,220
Just to be free.
Completely free to express yourself

1405
00:54:32,221 --> 00:54:36,030
without any worry about a word that's
going to get you fine for hundreds of

1406
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:36,170
thousands of dollars.

1407
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:39,630
And you got to remember like he got,
he got sued by the FCC,

1408
00:54:39,631 --> 00:54:41,910
right?
Like [inaudible] task.

1409
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:46,860
He had to go to court over that shit and
they wound up finding him like ungodly

1410
00:54:46,861 --> 00:54:49,770
amounts of money and there was nobody
out there with him when he was doing

1411
00:54:49,771 --> 00:54:51,740
that.
Like he's this,

1412
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:54,210
one of the reasons why I'll never
criticize that guy.

1413
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,580
He's like,
he's like one of the most important

1414
00:54:56,581 --> 00:55:01,581
pioneers when it comes to radio.
Like if it wasn't for that guy and going

1415
00:55:01,651 --> 00:55:03,710
out there like that and getting sued
and,

1416
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,060
and having,
there was all during the fucking Bush

1417
00:55:06,061 --> 00:55:09,930
administration man when they were those
johnny and Jack fucking time.

1418
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:11,730
Yeah,
those John Ashcroft fucks.

1419
00:55:11,731 --> 00:55:13,860
Man.
That guy was scary though.

1420
00:55:13,861 --> 00:55:15,480
All these people that were trying,
there was,

1421
00:55:15,481 --> 00:55:17,550
there was a lot of religious shit behind
it.

1422
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,220
It'll be shit their shit in their boots
over this fucking record.

1423
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,440
Well,
they would be dying over that record,

1424
00:55:22,441 --> 00:55:24,270
but he got sued.
I mean he,

1425
00:55:24,271 --> 00:55:26,520
he actually had to spend real money and
real stress.

1426
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,120
Imagine the government trying to take
you out all you are as a dirty morning

1427
00:55:30,121 --> 00:55:33,000
radio guy and the fucking government is
trying to take you out.

1428
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:34,620
You fucking probably get paranoid as
shit.

1429
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:37,110
You should get paranoid.
You fucking should be paranoid.

1430
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:40,470
What does it say here Jamie?
There all the different fines he had to

1431
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:43,540
pay for 19 nine oh my God,
this is insane.

1432
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,480
So it says he paid him if some of them
got paid.

1433
00:55:45,481 --> 00:55:47,180
I'm,
this isn't probably the initial fines

1434
00:55:47,181 --> 00:55:49,590
that they started as either,
but I think this is what they got

1435
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:54,620
whittled down to or and read them off.
1990 he got fined $6,000 from the FCC.

1436
00:55:56,370 --> 00:56:01,370
1992 he got fined $105,000 from the FCC.
1992 again,

1437
00:56:01,771 --> 00:56:02,310
he got fined.

1438
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:07,310
600,000 1993 got five find 500,000 1993
got fined.

1439
00:56:08,731 --> 00:56:13,731
70 3030 seven thousand four hundred
thousand in 94 200,094 holy fuck.

1440
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,420
And then it just keeps going on.
And on and the last one right there,

1441
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:23,630
495,000 in 2004 2000 and fucking and
that fucking insane.

1442
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:28,360
That's during the Bush administration.
After nine 11 he got fined $1 million,

1443
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:32,110
$95,000 half a million dollars in fines
for saying bad words.

1444
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:35,380
Wasn't even saying bad words.
He but he didn't even say bad words.

1445
00:56:35,381 --> 00:56:38,600
He didn't swear.
That's what was crazy was just top its

1446
00:56:38,601 --> 00:56:41,650
subject matter.
The d like talking about farts or Piss

1447
00:56:41,651 --> 00:56:44,650
or shit or something like that.
It was so crazy though.

1448
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:47,260
Such a crazy time.
If I were to say that to someone who

1449
00:56:47,261 --> 00:56:48,010
didn't know,
they think,

1450
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:52,150
oh you mean that the 50s or the 40 this
is fucking 2000 thousand four and if he

1451
00:56:52,151 --> 00:56:55,210
didn't go through that,
if there wasn't this backlash from the

1452
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:58,330
public finding out about it because
everybody I know that heard about it was

1453
00:56:58,331 --> 00:56:59,164
like what?

1454
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:04,200
How are they wasting our fucking money?
Suing him over a radio show that by the

1455
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:07,660
way,
has 20 million people listening to it

1456
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:09,880
every morning.
It's pretty obvious that people were

1457
00:57:09,881 --> 00:57:12,790
enjoying this radio show.
And when they stop enjoying it,

1458
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,100
it'll go off the air.
That's what the fucking free market is

1459
00:57:15,101 --> 00:57:16,660
about.
But it wasn't about that.

1460
00:57:16,661 --> 00:57:20,050
What it was about is controlling
somewhat cause it wasn't just his dirty

1461
00:57:20,051 --> 00:57:22,120
shit.
That's not what concerned them as much

1462
00:57:22,121 --> 00:57:23,980
as his,
his criticism of the Bush

1463
00:57:23,981 --> 00:57:25,700
administration,
his criticism,

1464
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,620
political political policies and his
willingness to say whatever the fuck he

1465
00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:31,030
wants.
He's a dangerous guy.

1466
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:33,040
He said too much power.
You thank him.

1467
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:35,560
You think that's what Kinda started
podcasts?

1468
00:57:35,561 --> 00:57:36,850
Do you think that?
No,

1469
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:38,440
I don't think that's what started
podcasts.

1470
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,140
Um,
but I think that for him that started

1471
00:57:41,141 --> 00:57:41,800
the,
the,

1472
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,700
the journey eventually to Xm,
like he had due to serious whatever it

1473
00:57:45,701 --> 00:57:47,410
was at the time,
he had to,

1474
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,480
like,
they were fucking with him constantly

1475
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:50,310
all the time.

1476
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:52,270
I don't think he gets enough credit for
that.

1477
00:57:52,271 --> 00:57:53,470
It's insanity,
man.

1478
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:54,860
Yeah.
Well he's uh,

1479
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:58,360
he loses,
he said he's a hero of mine that in 2040

1480
00:57:58,361 --> 00:58:02,290
got fine for those that cock for spink
during a product for maintaining anal

1481
00:58:02,291 --> 00:58:05,710
and genital hygiene.
Thompson was going after him.

1482
00:58:05,711 --> 00:58:08,050
He was doing those things after video
games and stuff too.

1483
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:13,030
If you remember the Tennessee guy and
then he got to vis and attorney Jack

1484
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:15,520
Thompson supplied,
the FCC was show transcripts.

1485
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:18,940
Oh God,
listen,

1486
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,920
I don't need,
that's not what I would I pay my

1487
00:58:20,921 --> 00:58:21,521
fucking,
well,

1488
00:58:21,521 --> 00:58:22,990
nobody did,
but it was official.

1489
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,680
I guarantee you a lot of it was about
controlling a powerful guy.

1490
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:29,020
Cause he had talked about running for
governor member,

1491
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,310
remember?
Yeah.

1492
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:31,510
Yeah.
But he would have got to have to

1493
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:34,480
disclose how much money he made and
that's when he decided not to do it.

1494
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:38,050
I wonder if he would do that now because
now everybody knows he's got a hundreds

1495
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:39,870
of millions of dollars.
I wonder if it even like the gut people

1496
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,860
run now.
They haven't disclosed shit.

1497
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,300
Well,
trump has.

1498
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,490
Trump says he's worth more than he
actually is.

1499
00:58:45,491 --> 00:58:47,500
That's what's hilarious about him.
I know,

1500
00:58:47,501 --> 00:58:49,600
but I'm saying has he,
have we seen the actual like,

1501
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:51,370
well,
Bernie Sanders just released his tax

1502
00:58:51,371 --> 00:58:55,630
returns in his tax turned said that he
made less money last year than Hillary

1503
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:58,030
Clinton did for one single speech.
Holly,

1504
00:58:58,031 --> 00:59:03,031
he made $200,000 and she's made as much
as I think to 90 for once be maybe even

1505
00:59:03,281 --> 00:59:06,010
in the threes for one speech.
I want to ask you to negotiate.

1506
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:07,840
I'll,
I'll release my fucking return.

1507
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:09,240
They're like kind of money.
I lost.

1508
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:11,500
How many seats is this?
There's about 400 seats.

1509
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:13,210
Okay.
I wanna like,

1510
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,160
you know,
quarter million bucks.

1511
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,070
What did I just told you?
There's like 400 seats and how much are

1512
00:59:19,071 --> 00:59:20,920
we charging these people and we got to
pay you that.

1513
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:21,993
You remember

1514
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,590
25 I think.
Memory,

1515
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,670
I'll take that pearl jam,
fighting over,

1516
00:59:25,671 --> 00:59:29,030
take it prices,
making sure they don't get to be 25

1517
00:59:29,031 --> 00:59:31,760
bucks and now people are paying 250,000
I know.

1518
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:35,210
Watch a speech.
Well that is obviously just bribery

1519
00:59:35,211 --> 00:59:37,460
money.
It's just bizarre that she won't release

1520
00:59:37,461 --> 00:59:39,830
the transcripts of the bribery money
anytime.

1521
00:59:39,831 --> 00:59:42,510
You don't want to release something.
It's always been good.

1522
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:44,690
Imagine what she said.
You know,

1523
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:48,350
they'll probably sacrificing babies and
shit and lighten owls on fire or

1524
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,560
probably had an effigy and the war
sturgis probably all over them papers

1525
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:53,750
probably.
He was probably one of the reasons why

1526
00:59:53,751 --> 00:59:56,270
she kept her mouth shut.
If it keeps,

1527
00:59:56,271 --> 00:59:58,250
it keeps his album's coming out,
I'm all for it.

1528
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,330
Yeah.
Whatever he's gotta do,

1529
00:59:59,331 --> 01:00:00,410
man.
There's a lot of people that need to be

1530
01:00:00,411 --> 01:00:01,610
shot,
right?

1531
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:02,400
Well,
yeah,

1532
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:02,951
he,
no,

1533
01:00:02,951 --> 01:00:04,340
no,
he's not taking out the good guys.

1534
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,770
He's taking out,
taking out enemies of the state.

1535
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:07,880
That's what's up,
dude.

1536
01:00:07,881 --> 01:00:09,750
He's like a showtime,
um,

1537
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,400
drama series assassin type guy.
Oh,

1538
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:14,540
maybe they'll make that show.
Imagine if that was the show.

1539
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:16,460
Sturgill simpson just run around.
It was like,

1540
01:00:16,461 --> 01:00:20,030
do you remember that movie where the guy
from the Gong show chuck?

1541
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,640
Oh,
come check the brains of a dangerous

1542
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:23,090
mind.
I thought it was cool.

1543
01:00:23,091 --> 01:00:25,850
It was kind of crazy.
I was half out of it and watching that

1544
01:00:25,851 --> 01:00:27,600
movie in a hotel room in Vegas,
and I know,

1545
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,690
I remember like falling asleep from
memory.

1546
01:00:29,691 --> 01:00:32,940
It was crazy,
but he wasn't really worried.

1547
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:34,220
He thought he was worried for the
government.

1548
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,320
It was,
but it was really weird.

1549
01:00:36,321 --> 01:00:37,490
It was like,
what is this?

1550
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:41,240
Like I remember reading it like reading
a passage from it too.

1551
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,580
Like it's a book.
And I remember reading the passage

1552
01:00:43,581 --> 01:00:44,360
going,
what is this?

1553
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,830
Is this fake?
Was he on drugs?

1554
01:00:45,831 --> 01:00:47,600
Like what is this?
And I never got into it.

1555
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:49,460
We were talking you speaking of that
Shit,

1556
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:50,880
talking about,
you know,

1557
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,640
First Amendment,
you know,

1558
01:00:52,641 --> 01:00:56,090
freedom fighters,
one of the a major hero and people don't

1559
01:00:56,091 --> 01:00:59,180
know about it from Kentucky Zone.
Mr Larry Flynt,

1560
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:02,410
he did a lot of fun.
I don't think people realize how I'm

1561
01:01:02,411 --> 01:01:03,520
putting that.
There was that movie made out.

1562
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,210
Yeah.
But I don't think,

1563
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:08,630
and he's um,
and people you get laughed at when you

1564
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:10,670
say Larry Flint,
flint is a hero of yours.

1565
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:13,070
Cause he's like,
oh cause you love hustler and you know,

1566
01:01:13,071 --> 01:01:14,630
I love naked,
but it's not what I'm talking about.

1567
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:14,901
No,
no.

1568
01:01:14,901 --> 01:01:16,190
Freedom of speech.
Matt.

1569
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:20,750
He did more for freedom of speech than
probably anyone alive right now.

1570
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:26,110
That you had to be as fucking crazy as
he took that shit to the supreme court

1571
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:29,750
because he was fucking insane and he's
rich as fuck.

1572
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:30,770
And he didn't give.
Yeah,

1573
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:33,470
that was the perfect amount.
It was a perfect timing to these.

1574
01:01:33,471 --> 01:01:36,110
This is before porn hit the internet and
the money kind of eroded.

1575
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:36,830
Yeah.
You know,

1576
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:39,140
back then he was selling those
magazines.

1577
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:42,290
He was rich from selling magazine.
He was going to lose everything because

1578
01:01:42,291 --> 01:01:44,480
of a fucking joke,
like when I was,

1579
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:45,620
yeah,
he really was.

1580
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,990
Yeah.
When I first came to la,

1581
01:01:47,991 --> 01:01:51,170
I remember seeing that building,
that flipped publications building.

1582
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:52,070
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1583
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:55,390
Well that's the norm is fucking huge.
I know some of the,

1584
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,100
the of his,
I don't know,

1585
01:01:57,510 --> 01:02:00,620
I've met him briefly.
I know some of his family members back

1586
01:02:00,621 --> 01:02:02,270
in Kentucky,
but yeah,

1587
01:02:02,271 --> 01:02:03,770
they got,
they,

1588
01:02:03,771 --> 01:02:05,210
um,
it's an empire,

1589
01:02:05,211 --> 01:02:07,810
but also I think when he dies it'll
come.

1590
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:09,080
There'll be talking about it,
you know,

1591
01:02:09,081 --> 01:02:11,870
they'll be,
they'll be the jokey national new shit,

1592
01:02:11,871 --> 01:02:16,871
but there'll be some really interesting
fucking pieces written about what he

1593
01:02:17,511 --> 01:02:18,170
actually did.

1594
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:21,570
Cause he really changed everything.
And like this album,

1595
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:23,520
literally this,
I couldn't make this album without

1596
01:02:23,521 --> 01:02:24,210
lyric.
I agree.

1597
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:27,330
And I think that what was going on with
him at the same time as what was going

1598
01:02:27,331 --> 01:02:29,550
on with a Howard Stern,
there were all real similar.

1599
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:32,850
I was real similar in the government was
trying to decide what people couldn't,

1600
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:36,210
couldn't do and the people that didn't
get defended where the dirty ones,

1601
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:38,790
dirty magazine guy,
the dirty radio guy,

1602
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:41,040
for whatever reason we didn't,
they didn't get defended.

1603
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:43,290
Where a journalist,
if a journalist is getting attacked like

1604
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:44,940
that for revealing the truth about
something,

1605
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:47,310
people would be up in arms,
the intellectuals be up in arms,

1606
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:50,520
but nobody recognized that.
It's just as dangerous to tell people

1607
01:02:50,521 --> 01:02:54,030
that they can't jerk off to hustler as
it is to tell,

1608
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:54,770
uh,
like a,

1609
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:56,960
a political dissident that he can't
speak.

1610
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:59,250
That's what I said at the trial.
I mean the Ed Norton Guy Played Him.

1611
01:02:59,251 --> 01:03:01,490
He's like,
this has nothing to do with whether you

1612
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:02,370
like hustler,
right.

1613
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:05,100
Has to,
it's no different than any free speech

1614
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:07,770
trial anywhere.
But by the way,

1615
01:03:07,771 --> 01:03:08,820
if you,
you know,

1616
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,500
if you,
if you rule against this,

1617
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:14,340
that it could lead to people being
censored in all,

1618
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:16,230
in all different forms.
But this is,

1619
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:20,250
it took something that fall that crazy
to get it to the supreme court and

1620
01:03:20,251 --> 01:03:23,820
someone that fucking crazy.
It's just too problematic when you,

1621
01:03:23,821 --> 01:03:26,400
when you tell people what they can and
can't talk about,

1622
01:03:26,401 --> 01:03:28,170
it's too problematic.
You know,

1623
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:30,870
if you,
if you censor someone for a specialty,

1624
01:03:30,871 --> 01:03:33,990
like sexual stuff,
like you censor someone for putting out

1625
01:03:33,991 --> 01:03:35,690
a magazine where people have sex and it,
you know,

1626
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:37,410
obviously people have liked that
forever.

1627
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,230
You do know what the,
what the actual trial was.

1628
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:39,940
Uh,
I'll,

1629
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:41,890
I'll repeat if it was an obscenity.
Right.

1630
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:43,000
But he,
he did it.

1631
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:45,510
He acted,
they had comic pieces in the magazine

1632
01:03:45,511 --> 01:03:49,080
and he did a piece where he said that
this one,

1633
01:03:49,081 --> 01:03:51,810
I may need help,
but Jerry is Jerry Falwell.

1634
01:03:51,811 --> 01:03:53,470
I think men,
but men find it.

1635
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,860
Okay.
But you said that before.

1636
01:03:55,861 --> 01:03:57,990
I find out it was,
I want to get the guy's name right

1637
01:03:57,991 --> 01:04:01,170
before I fucking Jerry Falwell,
Larry's flint.

1638
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:03,540
Um,
he was the big guy at the time,

1639
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:05,570
right.
Jerry Falwell's guy that got caught a

1640
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:07,620
hooker too,
wasn't it?

1641
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,590
Or has Jimmy Swaggart I get them all
mixed up.

1642
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:13,410
Jimmy swaggart crying on TV.
It was awesome.

1643
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,960
You don't remember that?
Oh yeah.

1644
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:17,410
I mean I used to,
I used to watch that shit all the time.

1645
01:04:17,411 --> 01:04:21,090
It was amazing.
It was amazing because we all knew that

1646
01:04:21,091 --> 01:04:24,050
he was a crazy fuck.
We knew it's not your fault.

1647
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:28,680
It's a Larry flynt and uh,
just Google Larry Flynt Supreme Court.

1648
01:04:28,681 --> 01:04:31,230
Anyway,
the point was this preacher

1649
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:36,440
had sex with his mom in and out house
and an outhouse.

1650
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:39,180
Yeah.
In the magazine and me had a cartoon of

1651
01:04:39,181 --> 01:04:39,751
it.
Right.

1652
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:41,650
And I went and saw Larry Flynt speak
cause I said,

1653
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:43,290
like I said,
I'm a big fan of his.

1654
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:47,040
And so they,
that the guy sued him.

1655
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,810
Well,
it's Jerry Falwell.

1656
01:04:48,811 --> 01:04:49,644
Okay.
That's what I thought.

1657
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:52,920
So he said Jerry Falwell had sex with
his mom and an outhouse and there was a

1658
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:57,930
cartoon like a mad magazine prior to and
your follow suit them for liable,

1659
01:04:58,351 --> 01:04:58,890
you know,
not,

1660
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:01,110
he's like,
it's obviously a fucking joke.

1661
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:02,670
Like I'm,
I don't think you know,

1662
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,760
this is fucking comedy.
And he sued him and I went to the

1663
01:05:05,761 --> 01:05:08,880
fucking supreme court and I went and saw
the Larry flynt talk.

1664
01:05:08,881 --> 01:05:12,030
And when they repeat,
when the lawyer,

1665
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:15,060
this is Larry Flynt said this is what,
when he knew he knew he was going to win

1666
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:18,700
the supreme court trial.
When his lawyer repeated

1667
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:24,540
what the article said that his,
his mom had sex at,

1668
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:27,280
Jerry Falwell had sex his in our house.
He saw the supreme,

1669
01:05:27,281 --> 01:05:31,300
he saw the judge just giggle for a
second and the lawyer stopped and he's

1670
01:05:31,301 --> 01:05:35,170
like,
and that's when he knew he had the trial

1671
01:05:35,171 --> 01:05:37,300
one.
Cause the whole point is you laughed

1672
01:05:37,301 --> 01:05:40,660
when I said it that this guy fucking his
mom out in an outhouse.

1673
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:44,320
Obviously it's how are we going to have
an argument that's not comedy when all f

1674
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:47,230
all you fuckers just started laughing.
He said from that point on,

1675
01:05:47,231 --> 01:05:49,660
he knew he was going to win.
And it was funny too,

1676
01:05:49,661 --> 01:05:53,680
he also said that Jerry Falwell came to
him years later and they became friends

1677
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:56,590
and he wanted to go do a speak,
cause I guess he had,

1678
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,320
you know,
maybe not watch his money.

1679
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:01,480
He wanted to go do a speaking tour with
Larry Flynt.

1680
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:04,350
And uh,
it's like,

1681
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:05,951
I just,
you know,

1682
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:09,220
I want the biggest supreme court freedom
of speech he's ever again.

1683
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:11,010
He said he realized that's when they
kind of,

1684
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,810
it's like to Jerry Falwell too.
It's all a show,

1685
01:06:13,811 --> 01:06:15,190
you know,
it's all,

1686
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:18,040
it was just a,
it was just theater to him.

1687
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:20,470
Like we,
we can go out and make some money on the

1688
01:06:20,471 --> 01:06:22,190
road and talk about each other.
Exactly.

1689
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:23,230
And it's like,
fuck you.

1690
01:06:23,231 --> 01:06:23,741
That was,
I was,

1691
01:06:23,741 --> 01:06:25,780
I was,
I was serious about it.

1692
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:27,100
And,
um,

1693
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:29,710
when a funny though it was like the
party with Jerry Falwell find out what

1694
01:06:29,711 --> 01:06:32,560
it goes down.
But when he did become friends and

1695
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:33,820
another one,
I have to look,

1696
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:35,920
I,
I'm almost positive that when he died,

1697
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:37,790
Larry Flynt wrote his,
uh,

1698
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:40,840
maybe for the La Times.
I think Larry Flynt wrote his obituary.

1699
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,070
Really?
Yeah.

1700
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:43,570
Wow.
But yeah,

1701
01:06:43,571 --> 01:06:44,860
they became friendly or later.

1702
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:46,420
But it was,
it's an interesting trial.

1703
01:06:46,421 --> 01:06:50,380
You should definitely check out and the
movie is sums it up,

1704
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:53,290
but just you got to get into the details
of it because what they used to do at

1705
01:06:53,291 --> 01:06:56,380
hustler was pretty fucking crazy.
I mean besides,

1706
01:06:56,381 --> 01:06:58,050
you know,
really getting in there and looking

1707
01:06:58,060 --> 01:06:59,860
inside the post and all that shit,
they're like,

1708
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:04,630
they had been in shit,
like they would do crazy like kind of x

1709
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:07,270
rated mad magazine and that was the
chip.

1710
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:08,830
Ironically,
they got him in trouble.

1711
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:09,913
Like,
you know,

1712
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:12,280
as you know that the,
it was what it was,

1713
01:07:12,281 --> 01:07:14,050
the,
the sex shit that they were actually

1714
01:07:14,051 --> 01:07:14,440
pissed.

1715
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,520
Well yeah,
but that was what they could catch them

1716
01:07:16,521 --> 01:07:20,540
on because they were so preposterous.
Some of them and there was so graphic

1717
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:21,741
that was,
I guess.

1718
01:07:21,741 --> 01:07:23,180
Yeah,
that must've been the one that was the

1719
01:07:23,181 --> 01:07:24,014
guy who,
uh,

1720
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:27,290
this is the letter he wrote in the La
Times after he died.

1721
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,550
How has find myself into there?
It is.

1722
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:31,820
He is that,
that's his,

1723
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:35,010
that's Larry Flynt Obituary for the
audit.

1724
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:37,130
Coal is called the porn king and the
preacher.

1725
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:43,730
Interesting is there the 1997 automatic
biography called an unseemly man.

1726
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,300
Yeah.
He's hilarious.

1727
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:51,870
He sued him for $50 million.
That's why I went to the Supreme Court.

1728
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:56,100
He kept losing the case.
I lost repeatedly yet eventually won a

1729
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:56,701
Supreme Gore.
Wow.

1730
01:07:56,701 --> 01:07:59,400
He kept losing it.
Now he's hugging me in front of millions

1731
01:07:59,401 --> 01:08:01,200
on the Larry King show.
Whoa.

1732
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:01,910
Yeah.

1733
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:03,040
That's insane.
One,

1734
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:07,190
how much it cost him to fight those off
because someone suing you for $50

1735
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:08,330
million.
If he lost her repeatedly,

1736
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:09,523
each one of those things

1737
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,510
it had,
luckily it was the right guy who was

1738
01:08:12,511 --> 01:08:13,650
crazy enough,
like you said,

1739
01:08:13,651 --> 01:08:16,280
and had the money to fight it because
most people would have just never

1740
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:19,670
wouldn't have thought at once much less
all the way up to the supreme court.

1741
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:21,740
It's funny,
man.

1742
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:24,020
It's funny.
The whole thing is funny.

1743
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:26,330
Yeah,
I mean the real story.

1744
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:29,070
It's one of those things where the real
stories crazier in the fucking movie.

1745
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:31,430
Yeah.
Well it's crazy that it's such a pivotal

1746
01:08:31,431 --> 01:08:34,520
moment and free speech history yet.
Like you said,

1747
01:08:34,521 --> 01:08:37,700
it's not something anybody ever talks
about that he actually had to go out

1748
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:40,050
there like that.
I mean they were saying before they're,

1749
01:08:40,051 --> 01:08:43,160
they're saying snl might not exist if
that was,

1750
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,170
if he had won that case.
Well,

1751
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,980
look,
if he can daily showering you that shit.

1752
01:08:46,981 --> 01:08:51,410
If you can't,
if you can't parody public figures,

1753
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:53,840
SNL can happen.
You can't do the daily show,

1754
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:55,700
you know?
And we could prove that in.

1755
01:08:55,701 --> 01:08:57,650
Here's the way to prove it.
It's sort of a round about way,

1756
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:02,800
but marijuana is still illegal in 2016
because of some bullshit propaganda that

1757
01:09:03,831 --> 01:09:08,000
was made in the 1930s so that momentum
carries on,

1758
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:09,410
even though it doesn't make any sense.

1759
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,420
You could still go to jail today for
growing pot.

1760
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:14,780
So if you think that if Howard stern
didn't have those lawsuits,

1761
01:09:14,781 --> 01:09:17,590
didn't pay all that money,
didn't make this big public outright did

1762
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:20,870
public outcry,
didn't have to go to Sirius satellite

1763
01:09:20,871 --> 01:09:23,720
radio.
If all those things didn't happen and

1764
01:09:23,721 --> 01:09:25,370
they won,
what did they shut him down?

1765
01:09:25,371 --> 01:09:28,910
What if they pulled him off the air with
Larry Larry flynt loss and never fought

1766
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:32,690
it would have everything buckled down.
How long would it take care of the

1767
01:09:32,691 --> 01:09:35,350
Internet to happen?
How would it would have taken forward?

1768
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:39,890
It have things like reddit or four chan
or these fucking uncensored blogs or

1769
01:09:39,891 --> 01:09:42,320
uncensored youtube content where you can
do whatever you want.

1770
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:44,420
Vimeo,
all that shit podcast,

1771
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:49,490
that ripple from those two guys is like
one of the most important ripples for

1772
01:09:49,491 --> 01:09:52,670
free speech media in 2016 and what's one
of the most important,

1773
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:56,000
like pivotal moments in the history of
free speech and we're talking about

1774
01:09:56,001 --> 01:09:56,630
that.

1775
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:59,240
It's amazing.
It's fucking crazy and crazy that we're

1776
01:09:59,241 --> 01:10:03,350
talking about an x ray had record that I
own on a podcast that you own.

1777
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:05,780
Yeah.
This wouldn't have been fucking like

1778
01:10:05,781 --> 01:10:07,910
this whole world.
The whole thing wouldn't have happened.

1779
01:10:07,911 --> 01:10:09,500
You wouldn't be able to do that record
in one way.

1780
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:11,180
Like he would've found out about it the
bigger,

1781
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,460
even though I make fun of like those
Florida Georgia line guys,

1782
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:18,200
there's a nice guys but handsome,
but we have a choice at least.

1783
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:20,550
Do you think they shave their pubes?
Yes.

1784
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:23,720
I think they shave each other's manscape
the shit out of that box,

1785
01:10:23,721 --> 01:10:25,760
right?
Oh do they got the best fucking dude?

1786
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:27,260
I bet.
Think if there's like a little hair even

1787
01:10:27,261 --> 01:10:29,180
on the head or the Brown,
the shaft,

1788
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:30,800
the shaft here,
those are weird.

1789
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,480
I shared those immediately.
I don't like that.

1790
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:33,520
Yeah.
It kind of freaks me out.

1791
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,470
I got in a couple of freaks me out.
I like your shower.

1792
01:10:36,471 --> 01:10:37,860
You want to get,
it just starts happening like I have an

1793
01:10:37,861 --> 01:10:39,950
ear hair now didn't have ear hair when I
was young.

1794
01:10:39,951 --> 01:10:41,360
What if my,
my shaft,

1795
01:10:41,361 --> 01:10:43,450
it starts growing hairs all over it.
Nonstop.

1796
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:45,890
Nonstop.
Like a wolf man and gets every time you

1797
01:10:45,891 --> 01:10:47,350
shave it,
it gets fucking heroin occur.

1798
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:48,890
Yeah.
It's like what did it happen on the like

1799
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,380
[inaudible] on the head.
Oh,

1800
01:10:50,381 --> 01:10:52,940
that'd be crazy.
What if that's what broke like has got

1801
01:10:52,941 --> 01:10:54,410
dick hair on there.
Someone.

1802
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,990
Sure.
Like some fucking big Russian dude.

1803
01:10:57,380 --> 01:11:01,200
Some Russian bear type character.
Some dude from Dagestan or something.

1804
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:02,570
A manly man.
You've got it.

1805
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:03,950
And this is,
I'm being serious here.

1806
01:11:03,951 --> 01:11:06,230
If you've got hair on the head of your
Dick,

1807
01:11:06,231 --> 01:11:08,780
you call me because I got my second
album.

1808
01:11:08,781 --> 01:11:10,130
I'm looking for a cover and that'll be
it.

1809
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:13,980
It's called dickhead hair.

1810
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,040
It's got,
it happened.

1811
01:11:15,041 --> 01:11:16,020
This,
there's some people out there,

1812
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:16,860
those.
So Harry,

1813
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:17,980
there's like some,
uh,

1814
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:19,890
this is Russian wrestler,
I forget his name is,

1815
01:11:19,891 --> 01:11:23,220
but he fights in mma.
We were talking about him on the podcast

1816
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:26,530
recently cause he's entering into some
grappling tournament's goddammit.

1817
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:29,820
What is his name?
I've only seen him compete on youtube.

1818
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:33,720
This is everywhere.
Gorilla.

1819
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,540
He's Kinda have something.
Wasn't that Paul Simon Song hair on the

1820
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:38,580
head of his Dick?
I think there was one of his best songs.

1821
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:41,670
It's catchy as shit man.
I mean you sitting around your parents,

1822
01:11:41,671 --> 01:11:44,590
they yell at you but it's a good song.
But that was this whole the shoes.

1823
01:11:44,591 --> 01:11:45,720
Nevermind.
I get the different,

1824
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,910
so you get those two songs and mixed up
all the fucking time.

1825
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,410
Yeah,
totally.

1826
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:53,970
Well if she lays it guy out there,
I don't know what the Jimmy's going to

1827
01:11:53,971 --> 01:11:58,440
try to find this guy but a yeah,
well it's weird that we still have hair

1828
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:00,500
in weird spots on her body like that.

1829
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:05,460
You're,
most of the body loses its hair in some

1830
01:12:05,461 --> 01:12:09,480
strange way except for the head and w
and the other weird spots like the pubes

1831
01:12:09,481 --> 01:12:12,000
like what the fuck is going on with the
human body and the first place.

1832
01:12:12,001 --> 01:12:14,940
It's so strange looking.
I remember reading an article about it.

1833
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:17,250
Achy pop back in his old stooges days.
Yeah.

1834
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:19,800
There's a dude,
there's the wrestler dude.

1835
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:25,020
Leave the hair on this motherfucker.
He's George g kit tool live.

1836
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:28,090
I mean this guy is mostly a gorilla,
but two,

1837
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:30,750
it's mostly a girl.
Look at that.

1838
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:32,910
I messaged her that picture on the phone
camera.

1839
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:34,800
You got some hair to look at that
picture though.

1840
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:37,110
Geez,
that's a God damn gorilla.

1841
01:12:37,111 --> 01:12:41,220
This dude's a gorilla and he also has a
Spanish bullying around his neck from

1842
01:12:41,221 --> 01:12:43,140
the pink tie,
believe I think he bought it from it

1843
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:43,983
from Florida,
Georgia.

1844
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:44,910
He took it from him.

1845
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:45,990
Give it to me.
Oh,

1846
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,150
let it break.
Nick,

1847
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:48,780
you're talking about,
hey are you need,

1848
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:52,080
cause I've never forget the article.
I was reading about egg in the stooges

1849
01:12:52,081 --> 01:12:53,700
and then he popped some,
you know,

1850
01:12:53,701 --> 01:12:57,220
he was on drugs whenever put glitter all
over his face and uh,

1851
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,670
he shaved his eyebrows,
put glitter all over his face and he

1852
01:12:59,671 --> 01:13:01,600
went on stage and they get,
it was so fun.

1853
01:13:01,601 --> 01:13:06,240
The guitarist goes and that's when we
realized why you had eyebrows cause he

1854
01:13:06,241 --> 01:13:08,540
was sweating and all the glitter.
It was getting in his eyes.

1855
01:13:08,710 --> 01:13:10,650
He was like,
he's like,

1856
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:12,810
oh,
so he's getting glitter in his eye ball

1857
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:15,120
and his eyeball cause he shaved,
he thought would be called shave his

1858
01:13:15,121 --> 01:13:17,150
eyebrows.
It's like you don't think about that

1859
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:20,100
shit till you get it done.
It must be brutal glitter and your

1860
01:13:20,101 --> 01:13:21,570
eyeballs.
Holy Shit.

1861
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:23,400
He's pop poppy and do whatever.

1862
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:25,470
He's probably still in their look.
Is he still alive?

1863
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:26,700
Yeah,
he's touring right now.

1864
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,860
Is he just made new record,
that guy?

1865
01:13:28,861 --> 01:13:31,950
I'd like to find out what he eats.
He's gotta be on a Ketogenic Diet.

1866
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:32,860
He's always super,
you know,

1867
01:13:32,861 --> 01:13:35,430
he just,
you know Josh Ami from Queens of the

1868
01:13:35,431 --> 01:13:36,240
stone age?
Yes.

1869
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,310
He just did his new record with iggy
pop.

1870
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:39,270
Yeah.
Wow.

1871
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,440
It's a new would be amazed.
It's fixed.

1872
01:13:41,441 --> 01:13:42,570
It's really good.
See there?

1873
01:13:42,571 --> 01:13:45,240
They're a great example.
Queens of Stone Age are a great example

1874
01:13:45,241 --> 01:13:46,980
of a band that's really hard to pin
down.

1875
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:49,050
Like say what do they like?
You'd go,

1876
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:52,890
Ooh man,
I don't know there they've got their own

1877
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:55,350
thing going on man.
There's certain queens of the stone age

1878
01:13:55,351 --> 01:13:57,870
songs while you listen to like a part of
it and you go,

1879
01:13:57,930 --> 01:13:59,340
oh,
that's queens of the stone age.

1880
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:00,210
You know what I mean?

1881
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:01,650
He just know,
look at that and they are,

1882
01:14:01,651 --> 01:14:03,000
they are Bam,
thank you.

1883
01:14:03,001 --> 01:14:05,670
Pops to look and could it guys always
shredded?

1884
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:08,000
I always wonder like is that just from
running around on stage?

1885
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,720
Does he exercise?
I saw him on the stooges were giving you

1886
01:14:10,721 --> 01:14:13,270
and I've never seen a guy give it.
He was better than Jagger.

1887
01:14:13,271 --> 01:14:15,190
I thought he,
I'd never seen a god give it his all

1888
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:17,200
like that.
He's still fucking rocks.

1889
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:22,230
Rarely hear people talk about him.
Like is kin is like a leather bound book

1890
01:14:24,011 --> 01:14:26,830
that they find in a cabin.
The summon the demon that age still

1891
01:14:26,831 --> 01:14:28,250
given the middle thing.
Wow,

1892
01:14:28,251 --> 01:14:31,000
that's important.
Never give up on the middle finger.

1893
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:33,310
I never get to the old.
How old is he?

1894
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:35,030
I don't know.
He's got be,

1895
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:40,630
he's in that ageless area where he was,
he did a lot of shit with Bowie and he's

1896
01:14:40,631 --> 01:14:42,220
got,
how old was bowleys?

1897
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:45,370
Mid Sixties what does it say?
Jamie doesn't say,

1898
01:14:45,371 --> 01:14:48,760
does it say as birth watts?
Now you come on son,

1899
01:14:48,761 --> 01:14:51,610
go to wikipedia.
It says his fucking birth.

1900
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:53,590
What does it say it there?
How dare you?

1901
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:56,500
1968 what are you trying to pretend?
He's a mystery.

1902
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,450
Not Use.
It pops right up on Google,

1903
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:01,300
but you just can't assume that it's not
out there.

1904
01:15:01,301 --> 01:15:02,860
He's almost 70 right?
Yeah,

1905
01:15:02,861 --> 01:15:04,370
he's almost 70.
That's uh,

1906
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:06,920
you know,
people still rocking out almost 50.

1907
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:08,890
He's an animal.
That's crazy.

1908
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:09,791
Yeah,
it was cool.

1909
01:15:09,791 --> 01:15:10,720
The Queen,
like you were saying,

1910
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:11,420
like,
you know,

1911
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:12,850
queen stoney's does whatever the fuck
they want.

1912
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:16,920
I'm sure there was no one who was like,
there's a bunch of money for you.

1913
01:15:16,921 --> 01:15:20,380
You go produce until her label right now
while they're on an indie label.

1914
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:21,020
Oh,
are they?

1915
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:22,810
Yeah.
I wonder how much influence an indie

1916
01:15:22,811 --> 01:15:23,650
label has on them.

1917
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:25,000
Not because they,
they can do it,

1918
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:26,740
you know.
Well that's,

1919
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:28,200
that's the future.
I mean,

1920
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:31,150
you don't need people anymore.
And it's also the people that were

1921
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:33,400
there.
They tendon exactly serve the best

1922
01:15:33,401 --> 01:15:35,200
interests of the work.
You know,

1923
01:15:35,201 --> 01:15:38,170
the people that are making these pop
songs like,

1924
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,560
you know,
like to put together a band like my

1925
01:15:39,561 --> 01:15:42,250
noodle or something like that.
Why am a noodle where they come up with

1926
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:43,690
that?
I kind of liked that and saying she

1927
01:15:43,691 --> 01:15:45,550
remembers them.
Do you remember if you remember?

1928
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,700
But you know like okay,
like um,

1929
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:52,390
milli vanilli or something like that.
This perfect example of just a creation.

1930
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:53,920
I mean they weren't even singing in the
real songs.

1931
01:15:53,921 --> 01:15:56,020
Right.
That's just a creation and get two

1932
01:15:56,021 --> 01:15:57,760
handsome boy.
They were also the only ones who got

1933
01:15:57,761 --> 01:15:59,860
busted.
There's millions of those you think so?

1934
01:15:59,861 --> 01:16:01,180
There's a lot of people that got busted.

1935
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:03,250
It didn't,
that did the exact same thing as they

1936
01:16:03,251 --> 01:16:04,084
do.
I mean,

1937
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:07,300
how did they get busted?
They got busted because one of the guys,

1938
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:08,980
um,
found Jesus,

1939
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:11,110
something like that I think.
But he,

1940
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:12,160
he came clean.
He said,

1941
01:16:12,161 --> 01:16:14,720
I came,
I can't go up there and performing the

1942
01:16:14,721 --> 01:16:16,960
songs anymore.
Wow.

1943
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:20,170
And he just came clean.
I must be like a pussy and money.

1944
01:16:20,230 --> 01:16:22,510
I'm pretty sure we're during one of
their concerts,

1945
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:25,150
their playback skipped and they go like,
well,

1946
01:16:25,151 --> 01:16:27,340
that happened to,
what's her face on Siren live too?

1947
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,160
I'm looking it up right now.
I think there's video of it,

1948
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:32,770
but that shit happens.
All who's the girl who who skipped on as

1949
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:36,370
girl who was the sister girl with a
giant tits,

1950
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:40,290
so they're trying to say that's how my
brain works by the way.

1951
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:43,720
That's how your brain works.
But then now I know I was talking about

1952
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:44,890
in a second.

1953
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:45,760
Jessica Simpson,
right?

1954
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:48,190
You give me a name.
I wouldn't have known it,

1955
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:50,740
but a body.
That girl's got good Lord.

1956
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:53,200
That's a perfect example of why someone
should say thick.

1957
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:55,720
Seen her lately.
Is She married?

1958
01:16:55,930 --> 01:16:56,501
Yeah,
she's married.

1959
01:16:56,501 --> 01:16:57,370
Some football player.
Dude.

1960
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:58,330
No disrespect,
sir.

1961
01:16:58,690 --> 01:17:01,140
Fuck.
But if you watch the image record,

1962
01:17:01,141 --> 01:17:02,050
it's,
she's already married.

1963
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,400
Yeah.
There's other ones like that.

1964
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:04,690
That's a,
that's good stock.

1965
01:17:04,691 --> 01:17:05,860
That's good.
Southern stock.

1966
01:17:05,890 --> 01:17:06,910
Yeah,
it's probably from Canada.

1967
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:09,890
Whereas you're from Texas,
Texas.

1968
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:11,210
That's what I'm saying,
Bro.

1969
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:12,690
I knew shit.
Hey,

1970
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:13,780
wait,
I think I'm doing,

1971
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:15,940
am I doing decent?
There were some Texas dates up.

1972
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,360
I hope so.
How dare you not,

1973
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:18,040
well,
we're going to do the,

1974
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:21,770
I do know we're not doing southeast
until they want me to wait til this.

1975
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:23,750
There'll be southeast dates up there.
Well,

1976
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,060
I mean how can we wait and they wanted
me to wait.

1977
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,050
That one actually I listened to people
on,

1978
01:17:28,051 --> 01:17:31,490
they said wait until school's back in.
Cause a lot of younger,

1979
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,710
you know all those sec schools,
you know.

1980
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:35,540
Oh Kentucky,
Alabama,

1981
01:17:35,541 --> 01:17:36,560
Georgia.
It makes sense.

1982
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:38,090
Right?
You gotta be in their town and also I

1983
01:17:38,091 --> 01:17:41,390
didn't want to do too many dates at one
time because my fucking voice and also I

1984
01:17:41,391 --> 01:17:43,160
just don't,
I'm not doing those giant,

1985
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:44,990
I want to go for a long weekend.
Come home.

1986
01:17:44,991 --> 01:17:46,460
I can't do it.
I'm too old.

1987
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:48,690
I can't just fucking long tours.
I hear exactly.

1988
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:51,740
How long do you only go out for a long
couple of days at a time.

1989
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:52,581
Yeah.
I don't go.

1990
01:17:52,581 --> 01:17:54,440
I don't do these.
Dunkin does though.

1991
01:17:54,590 --> 01:17:57,290
Dunkin's doing a 30 day tour right now.
He's a man.

1992
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:59,450
He's a maniac.
He got a bus the whole deal.

1993
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:01,070
I don't do that.
I took once.

1994
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:02,810
It's not fun.
It's not enjoyable.

1995
01:18:02,810 --> 01:18:05,510
Was it fun?
The fee for at the beginning or know the

1996
01:18:05,511 --> 01:18:07,160
shows were fun,
but uh,

1997
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:09,170
it's too many,
too many days where you wake up,

1998
01:18:09,171 --> 01:18:10,790
you stare at the ceiling,
you have no idea where you are.

1999
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,380
He's like,
where am I fucking,

2000
01:18:12,381 --> 01:18:13,490
I'm not my friends.
You know,

2001
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:15,170
all my friends who are musicians to do
that.

2002
01:18:15,171 --> 01:18:17,720
Just like,
especially now that we're getting older

2003
01:18:17,721 --> 01:18:20,540
and the younger even,
but it was crazy when they were young.

2004
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,040
We were younger.
I was like,

2005
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:23,120
man,
you're living the dream.

2006
01:18:23,121 --> 01:18:26,750
And they're just like,
I know I was supposed to be enjoying

2007
01:18:26,751 --> 01:18:27,860
this,
but it's just not fucking,

2008
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:30,620
one thing that helps is to do it with
people you really like.

2009
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:31,970
That helps a lot.
There's,

2010
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:34,730
there's lots of stuff that helps,
but they're still,

2011
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:37,100
you know,
when you're a kid you're just like,

2012
01:18:37,101 --> 01:18:38,720
oh,
getting fucked up,

2013
01:18:38,721 --> 01:18:41,060
getting pussy,
playing rock and roll or country,

2014
01:18:41,061 --> 01:18:41,420
whatever it is.

2015
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:44,360
It sounds like the ultimate life.
And so these people have not having fun

2016
01:18:44,361 --> 01:18:47,510
doing it.
They also should get a fucking real job.

2017
01:18:47,511 --> 01:18:50,600
And remember what it's like to have to
go somewhere every morning.

2018
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:51,051
Oh,
Dell.

2019
01:18:51,051 --> 01:18:53,450
Yeah.
And work all day for some of it sucks.

2020
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,920
It's just easy to get complacent.
Oh,

2021
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,370
it's easy to not feel Grad.
I used to spend,

2022
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:01,430
I used to spend my summers as a farm
hand bag and Kentucky.

2023
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:04,040
Yeah.
And I'm kind of farms,

2024
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:06,080
little mostly horse,
Lexington,

2025
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:08,750
and there's a lot of like rich fucks who
just by these giant,

2026
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:11,360
they're not like really working farms.
They're just like,

2027
01:19:11,361 --> 01:19:13,220
they build themselves up on Derby type
shit.

2028
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:14,150
Yeah.
They just like,

2029
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:18,950
you forget with horse racing,
it's one of the only sports where the

2030
01:19:18,951 --> 01:19:21,320
owner is like the main guy.
So you can,

2031
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:23,630
I've made billions.
I've always loved horses.

2032
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:27,230
Like you can win when the person,
they put it on the screen.

2033
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:29,300
When the horse went to Kentucky,
Derby is the owner.

2034
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:30,273
Right.
So you can,

2035
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:32,450
you can buy yourself into it.
You're like,

2036
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:33,560
oh,
I've always loved horror.

2037
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:34,940
Kentucky Derby,
the owners,

2038
01:19:34,941 --> 01:19:37,160
the writer.
Not the writing on the jockey,

2039
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:38,790
but I'm saying you don't know the
jockeys.

2040
01:19:38,791 --> 01:19:40,550
You know,
you know who the fucking owner is.

2041
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:42,110
Isn't,
that is weird,

2042
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:43,090
right?
Or,

2043
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:44,060
you know,
the real,

2044
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:46,070
I mean,
but he's not on the horse,

2045
01:19:46,071 --> 01:19:49,220
but he's winning and he didn't train it.
He hasn't tried to do a damn thing.

2046
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,590
They showed the trainer,
they showed the jockeys shut the horse,

2047
01:19:51,591 --> 01:19:53,420
but the real person,
they interviewed the owner.

2048
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:56,330
So you buy a big farm in Kentucky has
some dumb ass like me,

2049
01:19:56,331 --> 01:19:59,570
like we'd eat or whatever.
Why don't you ever read the Kentucky

2050
01:19:59,571 --> 01:20:01,340
Derby is decadent and dupre.
Oh,

2051
01:20:01,341 --> 01:20:02,174
I fucking,
yeah.

2052
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,033
A hunter,
s Thompson,

2053
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,530
other Kentucky guy who was a hero of
mine.

2054
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:06,230
Best.
Who's the best?

2055
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,460
And that's what a barbarian,

2056
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:10,950
he was fucking insane.
He was the best.

2057
01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:13,350
And there's some pieces that he wrote to
his day.

2058
01:20:13,351 --> 01:20:13,981
I'll,
I'll read,

2059
01:20:13,981 --> 01:20:16,230
I'll go fucking Christ.
I still think,

2060
01:20:16,231 --> 01:20:18,210
um,
uh,

2061
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:19,103
you know,
uh,

2062
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,510
fear and loathing is one of my favorite
books of all time.

2063
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,420
Fear and loathing is outstanding.
And you remember when they did that

2064
01:20:24,421 --> 01:20:29,380
thing where Johnny Depp read the passage
that he talked about like the,

2065
01:20:29,381 --> 01:20:34,381
the change that was coming in the 1970s
and how it all pulled back and that he

2066
01:20:34,471 --> 01:20:37,410
saw it all happen.
I mean he was the perfect guy to

2067
01:20:37,411 --> 01:20:38,120
capture,
oh,

2068
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:38,850
in the movie,
the movie,

2069
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:40,800
it was fucking great.
Johnny Depp was the perfect guy.

2070
01:20:40,801 --> 01:20:44,520
But I mean hunter was the perfect guy to
capture because he had been in the 60s

2071
01:20:44,521 --> 01:20:46,800
and Berkeley during the acid times and
you know,

2072
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:49,620
the Timothy leary and the merry
pranksters and all that shit.

2073
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,020
He had been with those guys and the Ken
Keyes.

2074
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:56,100
And then when it all pulled away and
everybody just got locked up and went to

2075
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:58,320
jail and the war on drugs and all the
things happen,

2076
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:02,790
he saw this death of the American dream
and he put it so eloquently and then

2077
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:07,110
Johnny Depp pretending to be him did it
for a scene in that movie.

2078
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:11,970
And it's fucking sensational wonder too
if it's cause di Johnny Depp's also from

2079
01:21:11,971 --> 01:21:12,631
Kentucky,
I want,

2080
01:21:12,631 --> 01:21:14,920
it's also a good friend of his,
they were friends and new,

2081
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:18,390
if you're starting from the same place
and your friends,

2082
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:20,370
it Kinda probably seeps into you a
little bit,

2083
01:21:20,371 --> 01:21:22,770
but certainly helps.
And Johnny stayed with him like when he

2084
01:21:22,771 --> 01:21:25,080
was doing that movie,
he stayed with them for a long time.

2085
01:21:25,081 --> 01:21:27,540
He lived with them.
But that book is a perfect example of

2086
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:30,300
like real,
just first of all,

2087
01:21:30,301 --> 01:21:31,530
laugh out loud.
Funny Shit,

2088
01:21:31,531 --> 01:21:32,700
the funniest shit you've ever read.

2089
01:21:33,370 --> 01:21:36,250
Dylan's up.
But so fucking he can read,

2090
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:38,280
he goes deep emotionally.
You forget,

2091
01:21:38,281 --> 01:21:41,070
he goes fucking deep and that it is a
great book.

2092
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:44,220
That's his well between that and
there's,

2093
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:47,790
there's a few things that he wrote,
like small pieces that he wrote to that

2094
01:21:47,791 --> 01:21:50,130
just go,
there were some pieces right before he

2095
01:21:50,131 --> 01:21:53,700
died that he wrote,
I think it was on espn website that were

2096
01:21:53,701 --> 01:21:57,320
like kind of predicted the whole world
that was going to happen.

2097
01:21:57,570 --> 01:22:00,480
That was when after nine 11 or check out
those articles man.

2098
01:22:00,510 --> 01:22:01,750
Cause it was he,
um,

2099
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,420
he,
it was almost like he checked out

2100
01:22:03,421 --> 01:22:04,650
because he knew what was going to
happen.

2101
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:05,730
Yeah.
He saw it.

2102
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:08,220
Well,
he was also like a serious alcoholic to

2103
01:22:08,221 --> 01:22:11,680
the point where when he was almost dead,
you couldn't even understand them

2104
01:22:11,681 --> 01:22:13,440
anymore.
He would do shows.

2105
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:14,880
He would do like,
um,

2106
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:16,350
Conan or not Conan.

2107
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:16,831
He would,
yeah,

2108
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:17,664
he did.
Conan.

2109
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:19,680
He did Koni on,
actually it was one of the worst where

2110
01:22:19,681 --> 01:22:22,350
they went out shooting.
They went to woody creek and they went

2111
01:22:22,351 --> 01:22:25,550
shooting and hunter was fucking hammered
the entire time,

2112
01:22:25,570 --> 01:22:28,950
the shooting guns in Colorado and you
literally can't understand a fucking

2113
01:22:28,951 --> 01:22:32,460
word he's saying he would get up and
just get fucked up all fucking day.

2114
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,830
He was so fucked up though,
that it was starting.

2115
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:37,410
It was like he had poisoned his brain.
Yeah,

2116
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:38,161
that's,
you know what I mean?

2117
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:41,910
Like he,
he had also been on ceres pain pills

2118
01:22:41,911 --> 01:22:45,120
because he had hip replacements.
I think he bought both of his hips went

2119
01:22:45,121 --> 01:22:47,340
bad and back then,
dude,

2120
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:49,500
when they were doing hiphop payslips
today ain't like today.

2121
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:51,780
Like those hips weren't so good.
Like today.

2122
01:22:51,781 --> 01:22:53,300
They've got it down pretty good.
Where I've,

2123
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:55,710
I've had some friends that got hip
replacements and they don't feel any

2124
01:22:55,711 --> 01:22:56,460
pain.

2125
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:58,410
It's amazing.
It's just they've placed this,

2126
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:00,530
this socket,
not official soccer.

2127
01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:02,160
He used to be that used to be the old
thing.

2128
01:23:02,161 --> 01:23:02,994
It's like,
yeah,

2129
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:04,350
major surgery.
You don't hear much.

2130
01:23:04,450 --> 01:23:07,060
Why?
Dude Graham Hancock was in here six

2131
01:23:07,061 --> 01:23:10,780
weeks after he got a hip replacement and
he was walking without a limp and I was

2132
01:23:10,781 --> 01:23:12,490
like,
how is that fucking possible?

2133
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:13,690
And he's like,
it's crazy.

2134
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:17,140
And Graham was like in his sixties right
holes.

2135
01:23:17,141 --> 01:23:20,290
Graham,
I think he's like maybe 60 at the very

2136
01:23:20,291 --> 01:23:23,050
least.
He's in his late fifties and he got a

2137
01:23:23,051 --> 01:23:24,910
hip replacement.
I want an old people used to get,

2138
01:23:25,190 --> 01:23:26,300
you know,
had to get hip replaced.

2139
01:23:26,350 --> 01:23:27,940
It's like how you do,
they were about to check out.

2140
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:30,370
Yeah man now.
And it was an ugly,

2141
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:32,440
ugly,
ugly operation.

2142
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:35,590
When they did it,
they'd saw off your fucking femur and

2143
01:23:35,591 --> 01:23:40,360
screw a bolt in there and it's like
there was a raw that had to go deep in

2144
01:23:40,361 --> 01:23:41,860
your bones and your bonus.

2145
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:45,900
A takeover that rod and hole.
How Old Graham?

2146
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:50,800
65 so he's probably 62 or 63 he goes hip
replace place.

2147
01:23:50,801 --> 01:23:52,660
Then six weeks later he's walking
without a limp.

2148
01:23:52,661 --> 01:23:53,920
It's crazy.
It's all,

2149
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:54,461
I mean,
yeah,

2150
01:23:54,461 --> 01:23:57,430
they're fucking fee.
I think buddy's a Jujitsu guy.

2151
01:23:57,431 --> 01:24:01,690
He's in his thirties he got both his
hips were placed in his thirties and

2152
01:24:01,691 --> 01:24:04,930
that's just from just train.
How long ago would that,

2153
01:24:04,931 --> 01:24:07,930
would that surgery take you out and 10
years ago.

2154
01:24:07,931 --> 01:24:09,040
Like you couldn't even do it right?
Yeah.

2155
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:12,460
10 years ago you'd be done and
everything after that you'd be done,

2156
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,680
you'd be fucked.
You being like real problem.

2157
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:17,440
Let's look at,
cause I watched as any Kentucky and I

2158
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:19,240
watch a lot of basketball.
They've got Paul George.

2159
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:24,160
Is he the guy I'm thinking about who he,
he broke his leg,

2160
01:24:24,161 --> 01:24:26,680
something awful last.
It was like they were like,

2161
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:30,220
his career was over and I think he had
like a good seat.

2162
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:32,020
He did well this season.
Like he just,

2163
01:24:32,021 --> 01:24:35,240
it was as if nothing had happened.
It's fucking bone came out of his

2164
01:24:35,241 --> 01:24:38,320
fucking leg and it was a dangerous too.
And he uh,

2165
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:41,420
didn't,
he isn't extra of it during team USA.

2166
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:43,280
I can't look at it.
Close your eyes.

2167
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:47,710
Oh my God.
He's back now.

2168
01:24:47,711 --> 01:24:49,270
All Star,
all star.

2169
01:24:49,870 --> 01:24:51,180
And this is not,
this is name five.

2170
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:54,160
This is last year.
I was like a couple of years ago and

2171
01:24:54,161 --> 01:24:55,840
he's an all star is here.
That's incredible.

2172
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:57,880
It's like just snapped.
But now you know,

2173
01:24:58,290 --> 01:25:01,120
they have all the,
this way healing things.

2174
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:05,350
They use all sorts of different methods
to accelerate healing.

2175
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,090
They just keep,
they're getting so good at it.

2176
01:25:07,091 --> 01:25:09,850
Doctors are just fucking unbelievable at
it now.

2177
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:13,350
It's,
it's incredible time to be injured and

2178
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,940
if you get injured now they just,
they fix you in a way that just wasn't

2179
01:25:15,941 --> 01:25:18,370
available.
Like I have to replaced acs,

2180
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:21,820
but I have a buddy of mine,
my friend Steve who was on the ski team,

2181
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:26,850
the US ski team in the 1980s and he's a
badass skier in the 1980s and his knees

2182
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:31,450
are devastated.
He's had,

2183
01:25:31,451 --> 01:25:33,730
and I would actually have to call him to
confirm this,

2184
01:25:33,731 --> 01:25:37,840
but I know he's had more than 20 knee
surgeries after.

2185
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:40,570
How do you fucking go through an animal?
He doesn't give a fuck.

2186
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:41,651
That's crazy.
Yeah.

2187
01:25:41,651 --> 01:25:44,660
He's in his sixties and still fights.
He still goes to gym and spars.

2188
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,350
It's thinking about competing.
It's almost like going to the fucking

2189
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:50,230
dentist at that point or getting a
haircut or something.

2190
01:25:50,290 --> 01:25:52,000
He's just an animal.
This guy is just,

2191
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:57,060
there's certain people that like pain is
a non factor to [inaudible] movement.

2192
01:25:57,880 --> 01:25:59,590
What does that,
that's the well look at it.

2193
01:25:59,591 --> 01:26:03,040
Poking out of the skin right there.
Holy that the local guy.

2194
01:26:03,070 --> 01:26:03,903
Yeah.
Yeah.

2195
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,430
Wow.
That's hardcore.

2196
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:07,420
Do you know how hardcore that is?
Yeah.

2197
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:12,620
I felt for the guy and I fucking hate
little so that that means it's serious

2198
01:26:12,621 --> 01:26:15,230
shit that is serious.
It looks like a tour through the skin

2199
01:26:15,231 --> 01:26:18,800
and all the muscle and everything too.
Like that is a serious trauma that

2200
01:26:18,801 --> 01:26:20,300
happened.
It was live on television.

2201
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:21,970
They were worried about that.
Um,

2202
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,300
with uh,
the octagon,

2203
01:26:23,330 --> 01:26:24,680
they're worried about that ever
happening.

2204
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:28,310
You know,
only breaks we've seen on legs and arms

2205
01:26:28,311 --> 01:26:30,740
have been non compound breaks.
But I think when it happens,

2206
01:26:30,741 --> 01:26:33,980
like that guy just had it,
it becomes more problematic because when

2207
01:26:33,981 --> 01:26:35,750
it breaks the skin,
you have all this possibility for

2208
01:26:35,751 --> 01:26:37,700
infection that exist.
It gets real bad.

2209
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:38,563
Well I remember,
uh,

2210
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:42,320
them really fast going over there with a
towel and covering it up cause it was on

2211
01:26:42,321 --> 01:26:43,700
live TV and they covered it up.

2212
01:26:43,730 --> 01:26:45,110
So like,
oh that's cause they didn't want people

2213
01:26:45,111 --> 01:26:46,000
to see it probably.
Right.

2214
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:46,791
No,
that's what I'm saying.

2215
01:26:46,791 --> 01:26:48,050
It's like the first,
it's,

2216
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:51,740
we live in a world where the first
reaction was get this shit off TV.

2217
01:26:51,741 --> 01:26:54,230
But yeah.
Why not go to fucking commercial?

2218
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:59,440
Wasn't it funny man that like movies,
there's every big action movie that you

2219
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:02,120
go to Wa watch somebody die.
Every one of them.

2220
01:27:02,190 --> 01:27:03,140
Yeah.
Like it's no big deal.

2221
01:27:03,141 --> 01:27:04,040
But people,
fuck,

2222
01:27:04,490 --> 01:27:06,530
it becomes a disgrace.
It's a real problem.

2223
01:27:06,590 --> 01:27:09,260
It's a disaster.
Like if you have to remember that Brown

2224
01:27:09,261 --> 01:27:11,900
bunny movie where Vincent,
what the flux is,

2225
01:27:11,901 --> 01:27:12,850
Miss Gallo.
Yeah.

2226
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:14,960
He had a movie where the chloe's
Virginia.

2227
01:27:14,961 --> 01:27:17,810
Did she fucking suck his Dick in the
movie?

2228
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:18,710
It's already,
and I saw it.

2229
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:20,500
Yeah.
That's the only reason why I started to,

2230
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:22,430
yeah,
it seemed like that whole movie was just

2231
01:27:22,431 --> 01:27:23,860
like getting to the blowjob.

2232
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:24,831
Like I was like,
blah,

2233
01:27:24,831 --> 01:27:26,090
blah blah.
Let's get,

2234
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:29,390
let's cut the walk to the scene.
If I can go home and get on a fucking

2235
01:27:29,391 --> 01:27:31,250
website in two seconds and see all that
shit.

2236
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:36,300
Well I think his idea was why can't we
have a real sex scene?

2237
01:27:36,381 --> 01:27:41,240
Like if you can have like people kissing
for real and rubbing each other for real

2238
01:27:41,241 --> 01:27:43,610
and,
but you know intellectually that they're

2239
01:27:43,611 --> 01:27:47,420
not actually having sex,
but it's supposed to be a sex scene.

2240
01:27:47,630 --> 01:27:50,990
So if you have these two people,
Vincent Gallo and chloe's suffocating

2241
01:27:50,991 --> 01:27:54,350
doing and that are adults and they
agree,

2242
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:57,350
they agree like I think you're
attractive or I'm willing to do this or

2243
01:27:57,351 --> 01:27:59,000
I think it'd be cool to do this in the
film.

2244
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:02,030
I want to actually give you head in this
movie.

2245
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:04,400
Why is that bad?
So it was real.

2246
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:06,440
It was 100% really came on her face and
everything.

2247
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:10,070
Like she sucked his dick like a champ.
Outstanding.

2248
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:14,000
It just put boat.
It's weird that it be like we all,

2249
01:28:14,270 --> 01:28:16,070
everybody I assume has gotten their Dick
sock.

2250
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:17,390
I assume.
If you haven't,

2251
01:28:17,391 --> 01:28:20,340
I feel so bad for you.
If you haven't put out a fucking record,

2252
01:28:20,341 --> 01:28:23,750
let my man nonstop.
That's what happens.

2253
01:28:23,751 --> 01:28:24,900
It's nonstop.
Dick Second.

2254
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:27,740
I can't even put,
I wish I had fucking two dicks right

2255
01:28:27,741 --> 01:28:30,050
now.
What'd you did that video for?

2256
01:28:30,051 --> 01:28:33,760
A eating pussy and sucking dick or even
pussy and kicking ass.

2257
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:35,810
Sandik doesn't come into that.
That comes through to the end.

2258
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:37,820
Um,
that audience,

2259
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:40,490
what was going on there?
Did they have the ideal?

2260
01:28:40,491 --> 01:28:42,710
It's told,
but because I got kind of thrown,

2261
01:28:42,890 --> 01:28:44,870
they told just an audience that you're
going to to get here,

2262
01:28:44,871 --> 01:28:48,290
like you're just going to watch a real
country guy just in country.

2263
01:28:48,291 --> 01:28:49,610
I didn't know that they had told them
that,

2264
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:51,510
but there was only like 15 people in
there.

2265
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,990
There's,
I feel like there was a more like 150,

2266
01:28:53,991 --> 01:28:56,120
a hundred and,
and so they were just waiting for a

2267
01:28:56,121 --> 01:28:57,560
country song,
which I find out later.

2268
01:28:57,561 --> 01:29:00,560
And then when I got to even the eating
pussy,

2269
01:29:00,561 --> 01:29:02,400
they,
their faces fucking dropped.

2270
01:29:02,401 --> 01:29:03,960
I knew I was and this is not my best
gig.

2271
01:29:04,350 --> 01:29:07,290
And then I was like,
we got to get to the,

2272
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:08,740
you know,
the Dick Suck,

2273
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:11,880
which is going to ramp it up a notch.
And uh,

2274
01:29:13,170 --> 01:29:16,200
then I think a couple people walked out
and like weren't too happy.

2275
01:29:16,201 --> 01:29:18,810
But I'll tell you what it was.
It's one for the ages.

2276
01:29:18,811 --> 01:29:20,940
It's certainly,
you've got the shit out there.

2277
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,310
I was amazing.
Nobody yelled anything out like nobody

2278
01:29:23,311 --> 01:29:24,960
told you to stop.
Well I think they're,

2279
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:27,330
they were,
someone told me that they were at,

2280
01:29:27,370 --> 01:29:29,240
I think they were extra,
so I think they probably lost.

2281
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:31,120
Oh you probably would have knocked.

2282
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:34,770
Got Cause I didn't know I was walking
into like a fucking allergy kind of

2283
01:29:34,771 --> 01:29:36,160
thing.
Oh that's fine.

2284
01:29:36,161 --> 01:29:38,250
I'm just there to play this fucking
dirty country song.

2285
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:41,040
Oh that's funny.
So they just hired some country looking

2286
01:29:41,041 --> 01:29:41,791
people?
No,

2287
01:29:41,791 --> 01:29:45,030
I think they hired people who said they
were fans of country music.

2288
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:46,560
Okay.
And then they said,

2289
01:29:46,561 --> 01:29:48,150
do you want to be a part of a music
video?

2290
01:29:48,151 --> 01:29:49,150
Just have a seat.
Yeah.

2291
01:29:49,151 --> 01:29:51,310
Cause you could see like there's a guy
here,

2292
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:53,870
punch plate.
Jamie put what's the,

2293
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:56,370
what's the video?
It's called a eating pussy and kicking

2294
01:29:56,371 --> 01:30:01,350
ass
and I'll play him the place at least the

2295
01:30:01,351 --> 01:30:02,790
second from the one on the album.
Okay.

2296
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:06,510
But the one I want to watch,
the one words the from the bench show.

2297
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:09,690
What was the falling out with Ben?
He just fucking out.

2298
01:30:09,691 --> 01:30:11,220
He didn't even pay me for that.
Really?

2299
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:13,470
I play by play.
He didn't pay me for the music or even

2300
01:30:13,471 --> 01:30:14,940
the appearance.
That's so rude.

2301
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,110
But look,
you have the last laugh here.

2302
01:30:17,111 --> 01:30:18,180
Yes.
What's he doing now?

2303
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:24,410
These people in the audience
any better.

2304
01:30:25,550 --> 01:30:28,070
I like the American flag and I just got
off the,

2305
01:30:28,071 --> 01:30:30,570
I didn't have a beer at the time,
so then they're like my boss man.

2306
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:32,480
I didn't want to,
I was scared about

2307
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:38,300
fucking
pussy and kicked his ass

2308
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:45,030
pussy kicking a house,
eating pussy and kicking ass,

2309
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:49,220
eating pussy,
kicking a house,

2310
01:30:50,180 --> 01:30:52,460
eat pussy.
And these people are just not

2311
01:30:52,461 --> 01:30:54,370
responding.
They don't and that's what I do.

2312
01:30:54,371 --> 01:30:59,371
I don't know what to do with you.
The lady in the night and eat a lot of

2313
01:31:00,201 --> 01:31:02,060
pussy.
Then I get into a fight

2314
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:09,050
Thursday night I was feeling pretty
good.

2315
01:31:09,051 --> 01:31:11,600
I was walking down the boulevard,
Hollywood.

2316
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:15,590
See this young girl,
she's smiling at me.

2317
01:31:15,591 --> 01:31:18,550
So I took it back to my hotel and paid
the beans,

2318
01:31:19,730 --> 01:31:22,340
the golf skirt.
I knew that something was wrong where

2319
01:31:22,341 --> 01:31:25,630
they're supposed to be a pussy.
This girl had well

2320
01:31:27,170 --> 01:31:28,820
keep killing a little bit.
Anyway,

2321
01:31:29,630 --> 01:31:32,090
Dick and then uh,
kicked his ass,

2322
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:41,780
sucking Dick,
sucking Dick and kicking ass,

2323
01:31:46,310 --> 01:31:48,640
eating pussy,
sucking Dick and kicking it out.

2324
01:31:51,350 --> 01:31:55,400
Plus he sucking Dick at kick Eaton
fucking Dick and kicking ass.

2325
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:04,223
I love that.

2326
01:32:04,370 --> 01:32:05,620
A little kid there.
Um,

2327
01:32:05,870 --> 01:32:07,940
they get mad at you after that was over?
No,

2328
01:32:07,941 --> 01:32:10,100
cause I just went back to this fucking
trailer.

2329
01:32:10,101 --> 01:32:14,650
I never even talked to him again.
Can you go to the,

2330
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:17,750
is it the version of it?
I want you to hear how a great fucking

2331
01:32:17,751 --> 01:32:18,620
producer yet.
Okay.

2332
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:20,400
Go to the,
the dose.

2333
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:21,980
There's another version of that,
Jamie.

2334
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:25,010
That's just the album.
You just see the cover photo and then

2335
01:32:25,011 --> 01:32:26,930
you hear the music.
Same Song.

2336
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:30,530
Here we go folks.
Here's the producer produced version of

2337
01:32:30,531 --> 01:32:31,364
it.

2338
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:37,100
Fuck yeah.
More federal money.

2339
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:40,613
Yeah.

2340
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:46,910
Is this Good
Friday night and just got old for my

2341
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:54,000
mall smile
so I have to work on with his last pool.

2342
01:32:56,550 --> 01:33:01,550
Seeing design.
Dude,

2343
01:33:02,731 --> 01:33:04,840
I'm fucking 12 years old.
I really,

2344
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:07,260
that's what happened.
We don't censor yourself.

2345
01:33:07,261 --> 01:33:08,550
You become a kid again.
You know,

2346
01:33:09,090 --> 01:33:12,480
I'm always like this.
This is my kind of music.

2347
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:15,420
A lot.
It's bigger.

2348
01:33:15,450 --> 01:33:18,760
One owner.
That is so ridiculous.

2349
01:33:18,761 --> 01:33:21,160
I want to hear the second part about
sucking Dick Ass.

2350
01:33:21,370 --> 01:33:24,200
Let's keep it going.
How is this version front long.

2351
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:26,680
Hey,
fast forward to the second day.

2352
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:30,810
Try to find this Dick Second power play
studio.

2353
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:34,210
You kind of,
what is it more versus in this one?

2354
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:35,770
Yeah,

2355
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:37,570
Okay.
Oh man,

2356
01:33:37,571 --> 01:33:39,440
I went on forever.
Once your money you just keep playing.

2357
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:44,860
So you had a bunch of these and this
one,

2358
01:33:44,861 --> 01:33:47,260
not just two.
I liked that you went right from one to

2359
01:33:47,261 --> 01:33:52,220
the next in front of those people who
are self walking on Broadway.

2360
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:58,600
Young girls.
She smiling back to Sam

2361
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:05,940
took up.
Most of the girl had to hear the fan

2362
01:34:07,391 --> 01:34:09,870
actually get pissed.
How studio inside paint.

2363
01:34:09,890 --> 01:34:14,060
Anyway,
Dick and Leanna kick design.

2364
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:24,020
That's a drummer.
How good does his voice sound?

2365
01:34:32,210 --> 01:34:33,043
Come on,
but

2366
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:44,250
I'm over here sweating.

2367
01:34:45,190 --> 01:34:47,290
Goddamn it.
Fucking play mode.

2368
01:34:47,291 --> 01:34:52,291
Fire.
Where'd everybody go?

2369
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:57,710
They didn't.
How was going there?

2370
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:57,980
Is it

2371
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,510
the same thing?
Cause they hadn't watched that clip.

2372
01:34:59,511 --> 01:35:01,790
They know where I was going,
but it was just songs sit on my face.

2373
01:35:01,791 --> 01:35:02,970
That's the one that people keep her.

2374
01:35:03,150 --> 01:35:05,410
So they literally didn't know where
you're going with that song.

2375
01:35:05,690 --> 01:35:07,630
Well,
they knew they wreck I people,

2376
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:09,230
no,
there's no record.

2377
01:35:09,231 --> 01:35:10,520
I mean,
I mean the people you were doing it

2378
01:35:10,521 --> 01:35:12,170
with.
I told the producer like,

2379
01:35:12,171 --> 01:35:14,960
don't tell keen pussy kicking ass and
don't tell him about the,

2380
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:19,850
Oh don't tell you the other artists
don't tell the drummer guitar player and

2381
01:35:19,851 --> 01:35:24,230
the Bass player that it's going to go to
the second date cause they hadn't seen

2382
01:35:24,231 --> 01:35:25,360
the clip.
So they love,

2383
01:35:25,370 --> 01:35:27,080
they love in the song and they still
like,

2384
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:27,831
you know,
they still love it.

2385
01:35:27,831 --> 01:35:29,450
But you know,
it'd be funny to,

2386
01:35:29,451 --> 01:35:30,660
uh,
um,

2387
01:35:30,820 --> 01:35:32,960
I thought I'd be flying to fuck with
that because I was just like fucking

2388
01:35:32,961 --> 01:35:33,794
with people,
you know.

2389
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:37,040
And uh,
I don't know about that.

2390
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:40,510
They didn't even get high,
uh,

2391
01:35:40,511 --> 01:35:41,650
sit on my face.
Oh yeah.

2392
01:35:41,651 --> 01:35:43,090
That's a new one.
People are always be Chris.

2393
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:46,060
Let's now fucking co this is on some
country shit.

2394
01:36:03,450 --> 01:36:07,030
You lose a few,

2395
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:13,840

Beggars can't be choosy.

2396
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:20,760

You know,

2399
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:34,760

2401
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:38,520
The music is good.
Well that's,

2402
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:41,610
we got the best fucking record out there
right now.

2403
01:36:41,611 --> 01:36:44,040
I'm telling you.
Well what's good is it like the,

2404
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:47,040
the sounds are good.
Like I liked the way it starts.

2405
01:36:47,041 --> 01:36:48,210
It's like,
it's cool.

2406
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:50,490
Like I said,
best producer,

2407
01:36:50,491 --> 01:36:54,390
best players in Nashville doing this and
they had a fucking blessed,

2408
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:56,400
I mean,
like I said,

2409
01:36:56,401 --> 01:36:58,390
it's going to,
I'm going to get banned from music row,

2410
01:36:58,391 --> 01:36:59,050
but I don't get it.
Oh,

2411
01:36:59,050 --> 01:37:01,290
who cares?
You know Dick dead.

2412
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:03,780
They're all dead in the water.
You could sell records anymore.

2413
01:37:03,781 --> 01:37:06,240
Nobody sells records.
You sell things on Itunes,

2414
01:37:06,810 --> 01:37:10,040
nobody's buying records and you and ma,
what percentage of records actually get

2415
01:37:10,050 --> 01:37:12,300
bought?
How many people have a CD in their house

2416
01:37:12,301 --> 01:37:13,830
anymore?
It's nones.

2417
01:37:13,950 --> 01:37:15,690
It's all gone.
I don't even know how to get the CD on

2418
01:37:15,691 --> 01:37:16,620
him.
I fucking falling.

2419
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:17,670
No,
I haven't.

2420
01:37:17,730 --> 01:37:20,850
I've had two cars in a row where at a
three year lease where I'd never put a

2421
01:37:20,851 --> 01:37:22,990
single fucking thing in the CD holder
here,

2422
01:37:22,991 --> 01:37:25,920
the little cd slot,
it's in two fucking cars in a row,

2423
01:37:26,070 --> 01:37:27,120
two leases,
three t,

2424
01:37:27,150 --> 01:37:30,780
three year leases.
So I haven't used a CD in six years.

2425
01:37:30,781 --> 01:37:32,970
At least I wanna hear something funny.
So like you're saying,

2426
01:37:32,971 --> 01:37:35,700
it's about selling the other shit.
So we go selling them on itunes.

2427
01:37:35,701 --> 01:37:36,534
People buy them on

2428
01:37:37,830 --> 01:37:39,420
going about like March.
So we have this,

2429
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:43,130
that shirt I gave you with the logo on
it and a bunch of people were kept

2430
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:45,540
emailing me to uh,
that they,

2431
01:37:45,830 --> 01:37:49,500
I wish I had an example of it,
but then they kept email by it

2432
01:37:49,810 --> 01:37:52,060
can email me that we don't have fat fuck
sizes.

2433
01:37:52,090 --> 01:37:54,820
That was what their little work.
I get that at [inaudible] dot com yeah,

2434
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:55,853

2435
01:37:56,060 --> 01:37:59,130
So I go,

2436
01:37:59,131 --> 01:38:00,810

2440
01:38:08,370 --> 01:38:09,870
And they're like,

2441
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:11,011
It's like,

2442
01:38:11,011 --> 01:38:12,290

2443
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:15,570
You know,

2444
01:38:16,650 --> 01:38:19,530
You can buy a wheel or walk on my left
on my fucking whatever.

2445
01:38:19,531 --> 01:38:21,380
Merge store.
You can buy a wheel marker.

2446
01:38:21,750 --> 01:38:24,270
Not only can you buy fat folks,
if you're a fat fuck,

2447
01:38:24,271 --> 01:38:28,510
you can't buy the regular shirt.
You have to lose the weight or you got

2448
01:38:28,511 --> 01:38:33,511
to buy a fat book size every double xl.
Triple xl says fet books as big red

2449
01:38:33,601 --> 01:38:35,790

And like I said,

2450
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:38,460

I bet a lot of girls are sleeping.

2451
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:40,020
I'm like nineties.
Yeah,

2452
01:38:40,021 --> 01:38:40,560

I mean,

2453
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:43,230
you should see one girl send me a
picture of her in the shirt.

2454
01:38:43,410 --> 01:38:44,940
It goes to her fuck.
You know,

2455
01:38:44,941 --> 01:38:45,774
it's like,
uh,

2456
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,670
she put a belt around it and go,
you know,

2457
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:50,290
go out for the night.
Like it's a like a dress.

2458
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:54,570
So you were about that far away from
quitting music.

2459
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:55,530
There it is.
Fat Fuck,

2460
01:38:55,531 --> 01:38:58,740
size only 20 bucks.
That's a good deal,

2461
01:38:58,741 --> 01:39:00,540
dude.
You were like that,

2462
01:39:00,990 --> 01:39:03,960
that close to quitting music and now,
no.

2463
01:39:03,961 --> 01:39:04,441
Yeah,
no,

2464
01:39:04,441 --> 01:39:05,490
it was,
this was,

2465
01:39:05,610 --> 01:39:08,970
here's this is it,
this is my party song.

2466
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:11,820
I'm gonna play my final show and we're
going to fucking,

2467
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:13,800
I'm going to go back to Kentucky,
live on,

2468
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:14,940
you know,
farm,

2469
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:15,983
try to,
you know,

2470
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:19,020
you know,
had x and all that kind of bullshit.

2471
01:39:19,021 --> 01:39:21,660
And I was like,
this was my parting gift has,

2472
01:39:21,690 --> 01:39:22,410
you know,
like a,

2473
01:39:22,410 --> 01:39:23,340
like a game show or something.

2474
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:25,830
And then I got a call,
like,

2475
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:27,810
actually it was before it came out.
They're like,

2476
01:39:27,811 --> 01:39:28,590
we,
we,

2477
01:39:28,590 --> 01:39:32,700
we think it's going to sell.
And I just met my manager a fucking

2478
01:39:32,730 --> 01:39:33,570
piece of shit.
Dumb ass.

2479
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:36,900
But he's like,
and he was about to go on and move onto

2480
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:38,340
to others,
find other jobs.

2481
01:39:38,341 --> 01:39:40,110
So,
and then it's,

2482
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:44,760
it's,
you go into the studio not giving a

2483
01:39:44,761 --> 01:39:47,460
shit,
putting out an album about how fucking

2484
01:39:47,461 --> 01:39:51,000
shitty your life is and how everything's
gone to shit and not giving a shit what

2485
01:39:51,001 --> 01:39:54,420
people think.
This is the one that's gonna work,

2486
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:55,760
you know?
So we call,

2487
01:39:55,780 --> 01:39:57,900
he's like,
you're,

2488
01:39:57,930 --> 01:39:59,580
you know,
it's like,

2489
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:03,330
like I said,
we had bunch of Presales to like I guess

2490
01:40:03,331 --> 01:40:04,950
on itunes you can buy before it comes
out.

2491
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:06,750
Cause we,
so we knew before that week,

2492
01:40:06,930 --> 01:40:10,190
they're like the Presales,
like you're not the number.

2493
01:40:10,350 --> 01:40:15,350
He my people called Amazon and itunes to
thinking there was a mistake on both of

2494
01:40:16,471 --> 01:40:17,820
them are like,
how can,

2495
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:20,370
cause we only put out a couple of
[inaudible] songs on youtube.

2496
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:23,910
How's it sound?
This fucking much like as a decimal

2497
01:40:23,911 --> 01:40:27,180
point in the wrong place.
And Amazon asked for a new shipment.

2498
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:29,790
We didn't even have the fucking seat.
We had to go print more.

2499
01:40:29,791 --> 01:40:34,560
We made like a thousand or something.
Are you going to do another one?

2500
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:36,300
Fuck yeah,
you gotta keep going.

2501
01:40:36,301 --> 01:40:38,220
No,
I was a thing as I was going to quit now

2502
01:40:38,221 --> 01:40:39,180
it's like fuck that.
You know.

2503
01:40:39,210 --> 01:40:41,220
Well this seems like it'd be fun to
write this shit too.

2504
01:40:41,610 --> 01:40:44,190
Well that's why I did it.
Well that's the whole point is making

2505
01:40:44,191 --> 01:40:46,090
music and writing songs is supposed to
be fun.

2506
01:40:46,091 --> 01:40:49,590
And when you write from the heart and
you write from without censoring

2507
01:40:49,591 --> 01:40:52,380
yourself,
the unfun part is trying to fit that,

2508
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:53,800
the nasty

2509
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:57,250
thoughts into something clean.
That's where it becomes on fun.

2510
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:59,920
Do you think you're going to do a
musical video for which one are you?

2511
01:40:59,921 --> 01:41:01,910
Queer is going to suck my dick.
Um,

2512
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:04,060
I'd like to,
we're talking to,

2513
01:41:04,061 --> 01:41:08,290
I'm a Spielberg about it right now.
He wants to do it.

2514
01:41:08,291 --> 01:41:10,510
It's just a budget issue.
Where do you want to do it?

2515
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:12,010
What?
California?

2516
01:41:12,110 --> 01:41:13,630
I wouldn't do it.
And like Santa Monica,

2517
01:41:13,631 --> 01:41:14,441
it's up to him.
I think,

2518
01:41:14,441 --> 01:41:16,600
you know,
maybe I'd love to do it in Europe

2519
01:41:16,601 --> 01:41:18,520
somewhere so we're in Europe would be
good.

2520
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:19,990
Yeah.
Like really?

2521
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:21,670
You're all gay guys.
Yeah,

2522
01:41:22,030 --> 01:41:23,160
I want to do it.
You know,

2523
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:25,130
that's the right way.
That's a song you don't take.

2524
01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:26,990
You don't take that shit lightly.
Do it the right way.

2525
01:41:27,020 --> 01:41:28,870
You don't do it.
There are different kinds of gay people

2526
01:41:28,871 --> 01:41:29,704
in Europe,
right?

2527
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:32,310
What do you mean like wear better
clothes?

2528
01:41:32,660 --> 01:41:35,950
I felt like,
I mean a higher class quaffed yeah,

2529
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:37,110
probably.
I don't know.

2530
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:39,610
The ones they wear makeup there where
they have their hair done.

2531
01:41:39,611 --> 01:41:40,640
Right.
We'll do it in here.

2532
01:41:41,490 --> 01:41:42,530
Yeah.
I'm all about,

2533
01:41:42,570 --> 01:41:43,403
you know,
thing.

2534
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:45,130
And I remember Bruno.
Yeah.

2535
01:41:45,131 --> 01:41:47,280
Fuck yeah.
Ali G.

2536
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:48,850
Um,
I was a fucking funny movie.

2537
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:52,360
Allergies the past.
I heard his new movie,

2538
01:41:52,361 --> 01:41:54,010
like people didn't dig it.
I saw it.

2539
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:55,390
Did you like it?
It was pretty fun.

2540
01:41:55,391 --> 01:41:56,224
I mean,
it was,

2541
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:57,370
it was funny.
Yeah.

2542
01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:58,630
But it was,
it was,

2543
01:41:58,630 --> 01:42:01,540
the problem is when you compare it to
the shitty does,

2544
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:04,150
you know,
you can't compare a mood.

2545
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:06,190
It's like the other ship wasn't a movie.
This is like,

2546
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:07,870
it's just a real,
it was a funny,

2547
01:42:07,871 --> 01:42:08,704
it was dirty,
you know,

2548
01:42:08,730 --> 01:42:09,211
it's,
but it's,

2549
01:42:09,211 --> 01:42:11,140
uh,
it's actual drama comedy,

2550
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,190
you know,
it's like a comedy.

2551
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:13,850
Yeah.
But film school,

2552
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:18,850
it wasn't like,
it wasn't like you're living it,

2553
01:42:18,851 --> 01:42:19,870
you know,
like Bora.

2554
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:20,810
Yeah.
I think I can work.

2555
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:22,820
It was so ridiculously funny.
Thoughts.

2556
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:27,130
It's a problem because it's so rigid and
he'd have a really hard time doing that

2557
01:42:27,131 --> 01:42:29,920
again,
it's almost like to do that he's got,

2558
01:42:29,921 --> 01:42:32,950
is not do it for years.
And then people forget about it and then

2559
01:42:32,951 --> 01:42:34,690
go back in and do it again.
He uh,

2560
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:36,700
he did something at the Oscars this
year.

2561
01:42:36,701 --> 01:42:40,540
He would like presented an award and I
guess he had to agree to not do any sort

2562
01:42:40,541 --> 01:42:42,750
of thing.
He was just coming in itself,

2563
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:45,200
just snuck in his character.
We're using his wife.

2564
01:42:46,930 --> 01:42:49,360
Okay.
Funny bit funny.

2565
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:50,710
Somewhat.
If you've seen this clip,

2566
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:53,290
someone showed me this was fucking,
my brother actually showed it to me.

2567
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:58,300
He did got this Charlie Chaplin Award.
Did you see that thing?

2568
01:42:58,530 --> 01:43:00,330
It's Charlie Chaplin Award.
It was a year,

2569
01:43:00,331 --> 01:43:01,510
a few years.
A couple of years ago.

2570
01:43:01,511 --> 01:43:04,240
He,
they gave him this award for um,

2571
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:10,030
you know Camille is like a Charlie
Chaplin Award for like greatness and

2572
01:43:10,031 --> 01:43:10,900
comedy or something.

2573
01:43:11,220 --> 01:43:13,270
And he did this bit,
I don't want to give it away if you

2574
01:43:13,271 --> 01:43:14,470
haven't seen it,
but it's fucking,

2575
01:43:14,471 --> 01:43:15,970
it was the funniest fucking thing I
seen.

2576
01:43:16,450 --> 01:43:17,690
You find that.
Yeah.

2577
01:43:18,430 --> 01:43:20,070
Can we watch it?
And I don't know if we could play it on

2578
01:43:20,110 --> 01:43:23,010
out.
It's got a little over 4 million will

2579
01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:24,580
get pulled over and look it up.
It's on the beach.

2580
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:25,271
Well,
tell people,

2581
01:43:25,271 --> 01:43:28,310
what is the title of the video against
Sasha?

2582
01:43:28,330 --> 01:43:31,600
Baron Cohen Kills Presenter and accepts
award extended.

2583
01:43:31,601 --> 01:43:33,250
I guess it just [inaudible] the,
uh,

2584
01:43:33,270 --> 01:43:37,210
awards on BBC America.
Can I tell you what happened or do I

2585
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:38,950
ruin it for him?
He probably ruin it for everybody.

2586
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:40,840
Well,
do what you want to do,

2587
01:43:40,841 --> 01:43:43,090
man.
I don't want to check out the video.

2588
01:43:43,091 --> 01:43:43,924
It's really fun.
Okay,

2589
01:43:43,930 --> 01:43:47,470
I'll definitely check it out.
This is a good time for crazy shit.

2590
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:49,050
You know,
this is the perfect,

2591
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:50,170
I had to come out with this album.

2592
01:43:50,170 --> 01:43:53,510
What I say every,
every day is the new best day for this

2593
01:43:53,511 --> 01:43:57,830
crazy shit because everyday people give
less of a fuck.

2594
01:43:57,850 --> 01:43:58,890
And cause,
I mean,

2595
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:00,560
the honest truth is,
you know,

2596
01:44:00,770 --> 01:44:03,800
I met the producer and I talked to
sturge on.

2597
01:44:03,801 --> 01:44:04,634
I said,
you know,

2598
01:44:05,690 --> 01:44:06,980
I asked about that.
You know,

2599
01:44:06,981 --> 01:44:09,530
cause he's the only guy I knew who knew,
who knew Dave.

2600
01:44:09,531 --> 01:44:12,310
I go
and I go,

2601
01:44:12,311 --> 01:44:13,144
what?
What's,

2602
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:13,941
you know,
is he cool?

2603
01:44:13,941 --> 01:44:15,470
He goes,
he don't give a fuck

2604
01:44:17,030 --> 01:44:18,050
hired right there.
You know,

2605
01:44:18,051 --> 01:44:21,860
like don't get that's in these nowadays.
That's an ultimate compliment.

2606
01:44:21,861 --> 01:44:24,590
You can give me about anyone.
And he meant he meant as a co as a

2607
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:26,810
compliment too.
And so those are the people that you

2608
01:44:26,811 --> 01:44:28,680
want to hang out with.
All I care about is people who,

2609
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,430
you know,
I'm sure your audience knows,

2610
01:44:31,431 --> 01:44:33,860
but there's people out there who think
that the phrase don't give a fuck is a

2611
01:44:33,861 --> 01:44:34,150
Nigga.

2612
01:44:34,150 --> 01:44:35,180
You know,
like I don't care.

2613
01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:37,940
I care too much that needs someone who
doesn't care about the other shit.

2614
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:41,180
It's changing.
You know the phrase is changing now.

2615
01:44:41,181 --> 01:44:43,220
It's a,
it's a different thing now.

2616
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:46,190
Like not giving a fuck was like you're
an idiot or a loser.

2617
01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:47,630
He doesn't give a fuck.
He's a dummy.

2618
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:50,150
But now it's like I don't give a fuck
gibbon now.

2619
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:50,870
Yeah,
exactly.

2620
01:44:50,870 --> 01:44:52,880
Listen,
I can get banned from Nashville.

2621
01:44:52,881 --> 01:44:55,310
I could give it,
but I don't give a fuck cause I'm making

2622
01:44:55,311 --> 01:44:57,410
the record I want to make.
Well it's just amazing that that's how

2623
01:44:57,411 --> 01:44:58,410
it worked out.
You know,

2624
01:44:58,580 --> 01:45:01,130
that this thing's taken off because he
just said fuck it.

2625
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:02,930
Let's just go all in.
And I was like,

2626
01:45:02,931 --> 01:45:05,090
I said,
this is like the perfect time to person

2627
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:09,710
and I hate to bring it back to you,
but I'm here.

2628
01:45:09,710 --> 01:45:13,130
But you didn't do the podcast to get
listeners.

2629
01:45:13,131 --> 01:45:14,240
You just want something you wanted to
do.

2630
01:45:14,330 --> 01:45:15,680
Just do it for fun.
You did it for fun.

2631
01:45:15,710 --> 01:45:17,000
I did this record.
I was just like,

2632
01:45:17,001 --> 01:45:19,190
I want to do it for fun.
I don't when things are good man,

2633
01:45:19,191 --> 01:45:20,720
when you,
when you actually enjoy him,

2634
01:45:20,721 --> 01:45:24,320
like that shit is making me laugh.
Even the actually the opposite,

2635
01:45:24,321 --> 01:45:27,140
which is I assume no one's going to ever
hear this,

2636
01:45:27,170 --> 01:45:29,890
so I'm just going to go fucking all out.
So actually got,

2637
01:45:29,891 --> 01:45:32,390
it's kind of not scared,
but like when it went,

2638
01:45:32,690 --> 01:45:33,680
it debut,
like I said,

2639
01:45:33,681 --> 01:45:35,300
number nine on the billboard,
country charts,

2640
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:37,010
outselling all the big boys.
I'm like,

2641
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:39,260
Holy Fuck,
what the fuck do I do now?

2642
01:45:39,261 --> 01:45:41,960
Cause then you got to double down and
make it even go even crazier.

2643
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:43,340
It's hilarious.
Yeah.

2644
01:45:43,341 --> 01:45:44,960
And then that's when,
because then they're like,

2645
01:45:44,990 --> 01:45:47,770
you know,
you're real fucking is it as he walked

2646
01:45:47,771 --> 01:45:48,350
at like,
uh,

2647
01:45:48,350 --> 01:45:50,570
he talk it.
So I get on my twitter and I fucking rip

2648
01:45:50,571 --> 01:45:52,640
on Nashville,
rip on the music business,

2649
01:45:52,641 --> 01:45:54,520
rip on all these fuckers and that's how
you get in band.

2650
01:45:54,590 --> 01:45:55,970
And I'm getting banned,
but I come go.

2651
01:45:56,090 --> 01:45:58,550
So these Florida Georgia line guys,
they got mad at you.

2652
01:45:58,551 --> 01:45:59,384
They,
they blocked,

2653
01:45:59,430 --> 01:46:00,600
they blocked.
Uh,

2654
01:46:00,910 --> 01:46:02,690
there's a new guy,
I don't even remember his name.

2655
01:46:02,691 --> 01:46:04,480
He blocked me too.
I've got blocked by him.

2656
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:08,560
So who's Meghan?
Meghan trainor.

2657
01:46:08,561 --> 01:46:11,870
Is that her name?
[inaudible] she's in a country.

2658
01:46:11,871 --> 01:46:14,210
She's all about that bass.
She blocked her.

2659
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:15,770
She fuck all I said,
I just,

2660
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:18,290
he always promoted tweets that are on
your fucking thing,

2661
01:46:18,291 --> 01:46:20,930
right?
I said get this shit off my page and

2662
01:46:20,931 --> 01:46:23,890
then
there's not much to block me.

2663
01:46:24,170 --> 01:46:26,450
Promoted tweets are sneaky's fuck aren't
I know,

2664
01:46:26,451 --> 01:46:27,890
but it said promoted tweets.
So I go,

2665
01:46:28,310 --> 01:46:30,500
I seen this fucking tweet 18 times a
day.

2666
01:46:30,710 --> 01:46:32,690
I get it.
She got a new fucking album.

2667
01:46:33,570 --> 01:46:35,320
Um,
I don't mind like uh,

2668
01:46:35,570 --> 01:46:38,420
instagram promoted instagram thing cause
I feel like,

2669
01:46:38,450 --> 01:46:39,290
ah,
go ahead.

2670
01:46:39,710 --> 01:46:41,180
Well My,
I'm getting it all for free.

2671
01:46:41,181 --> 01:46:42,890
We're getting it all.
You got to get money out of this

2672
01:46:42,891 --> 01:46:43,820
somehow.
No,

2673
01:46:43,821 --> 01:46:44,720
no.
I listen,

2674
01:46:45,530 --> 01:46:46,530
I was,
I've done,

2675
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:48,650
I don't think I did a promoted tweet on
twitter,

2676
01:46:48,651 --> 01:46:51,660
but I've done on facebook and he,
and like half the comments are like,

2677
01:46:51,661 --> 01:46:53,040
get this shit.
It's the same thing as me,

2678
01:46:53,041 --> 01:46:54,480
but I don't block them.
I've got to say,

2679
01:46:54,490 --> 01:46:56,580
you're pretty sure you're worried here.
Speaking of Instagram,

2680
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:00,110
Bam,
Bam.

2681
01:47:00,570 --> 01:47:01,620
Yeah,
I got to do it too.

2682
01:47:01,770 --> 01:47:02,940
Hold on.
How do I do this shit?

2683
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:04,860
They ain't know how to do it.
And we gotta get,

2684
01:47:04,861 --> 01:47:07,000
we gotta go take a picture together and
I'll do all that.

2685
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:09,150
I just wanted to get a picture of you in
the moment.

2686
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:11,400
That's my new thing.
Let's get someone in the middle of the

2687
01:47:11,401 --> 01:47:13,930
podcast.
No posing before the podcast.

2688
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:15,930
Actually this conversation is going
down,

2689
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:16,820
right Jamie?
Yeah.

2690
01:47:17,130 --> 01:47:20,370
That's why we started doing the pictures
for the podcast and we used to have this

2691
01:47:20,371 --> 01:47:21,840
pose,
which I was,

2692
01:47:21,841 --> 01:47:22,980
felt was weird.
I was like,

2693
01:47:22,981 --> 01:47:26,580
why don't we just have one what in the
middle of us talking and use that and

2694
01:47:26,581 --> 01:47:30,900
that way you could see what a mess this
place is to cause chaos to my left here

2695
01:47:31,310 --> 01:47:35,090
you got a picture
and can,

2696
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:38,670
can I am
kicking that?

2697
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:39,480
I'm,
if I can't,

2698
01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:43,560
that's a catchy goddamn song.
He can put some bitches.

2699
01:47:43,561 --> 01:47:45,660
The catchiest song.
I disagree.

2700
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:48,960
I'm telling you eat pussy checking the
font of it makes me sing all day long.

2701
01:47:49,110 --> 01:47:53,850
I seen that shit all the time.
I eat and puts it kick kicking house.

2702
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:57,180
Um,
different strokes to everyone's got

2703
01:47:57,181 --> 01:47:59,100
different favorites.
Yes.

2704
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:02,610
Different strokes for different folks.
It's funny too cause do you never like

2705
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:03,840
okay

2706
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:05,280
when you make a record he was like

2707
01:48:07,510 --> 01:48:09,010
I didn't,
I thought about not putting that song

2708
01:48:09,011 --> 01:48:10,150
on.
I was like people have heard it on that

2709
01:48:10,151 --> 01:48:11,770
other show four.
I was probably not going to put her on

2710
01:48:11,771 --> 01:48:13,540
the record.
And that's one of the people,

2711
01:48:13,570 --> 01:48:15,400
you know,
there was a couple of songs at the ones

2712
01:48:15,401 --> 01:48:17,170
that people liked the most were the ones
I was like,

2713
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:19,270
I don't know if I want to recall.
It probably happens in comedy too.

2714
01:48:19,271 --> 01:48:23,320
Like I don't know if this jokes,
it's kind of like a throwaway joke and

2715
01:48:23,321 --> 01:48:25,510
it ends up being getting the biggest
fucking life for the show.

2716
01:48:25,570 --> 01:48:27,610
You'd never know when you actually write
something out.

2717
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:28,690
That's what's funny.
You know,

2718
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:30,140
you write things out and you go,
man,

2719
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:31,930
this part don't work that good.
And that part gets,

2720
01:48:31,931 --> 01:48:33,400
is huge.
Fucking laugh and you're like,

2721
01:48:33,610 --> 01:48:36,070
oh,
it's weird.

2722
01:48:36,220 --> 01:48:38,110
It's weird when people like you know,
some songs,

2723
01:48:38,111 --> 01:48:40,810
I mean it's gotta be just some songs
that you don't think are your best songs

2724
01:48:40,811 --> 01:48:41,800
and people pull you aside.

2725
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:44,710
Like what sturgeon,
they say you can have the crown song.

2726
01:48:44,730 --> 01:48:45,880
Yeah,
he fucking hates that.

2727
01:48:45,881 --> 01:48:47,170
Sorry man.
I'm telling you dude,

2728
01:48:47,171 --> 01:48:48,530
I listen to that song.
All the fun.

2729
01:48:48,531 --> 01:48:52,960
I love that song is one of my all time
favorite songs and he doesn't even like

2730
01:48:52,961 --> 01:48:54,400
it happens all the time.
Yeah.

2731
01:48:54,401 --> 01:48:56,890
I mean like well the title track Redneck
Shit.

2732
01:48:56,891 --> 01:48:59,200
I tried to talk,
he finally talked me into recording

2733
01:48:59,201 --> 01:49:00,940
cause my demo,
you know cause it's weird because it's

2734
01:49:00,941 --> 01:49:04,060
your song.
So when someone's telling you that your

2735
01:49:04,061 --> 01:49:05,020
song is,
it's like a,

2736
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:07,120
and you're telling them it's not.
It's like a weird argument.

2737
01:49:07,121 --> 01:49:08,530
You're arguing about yourself.
I go,

2738
01:49:08,531 --> 01:49:11,870
let's try it.
And it was so good that I put it the

2739
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:15,100
title track first track on the record,
you know like he was right.

2740
01:49:15,230 --> 01:49:18,040
You know you,
that's why you need that second voice.

2741
01:49:18,041 --> 01:49:20,140
Sometimes that shit is a good one too.

2742
01:49:20,140 --> 01:49:23,680
It's like a good introduction song to
what you're doing and having that be the

2743
01:49:23,681 --> 01:49:26,860
first song of smart because if someone
listens to that then they'll get hooked

2744
01:49:26,861 --> 01:49:29,250
and then,
and then by the time they get to eat and

2745
01:49:29,251 --> 01:49:31,270
pussy kicking ass,
they're already in.

2746
01:49:31,271 --> 01:49:34,180
Well that's what I've noticed.
If you look on itunes later,

2747
01:49:34,181 --> 01:49:37,420
like every fucking country record on
itunes,

2748
01:49:37,421 --> 01:49:40,150
it's all five stars because everyone who
buys it on the ratings,

2749
01:49:40,151 --> 01:49:41,350
they all buy it.
They know what they're getting,

2750
01:49:41,351 --> 01:49:43,300
they love it.
I'm the only one on there,

2751
01:49:43,330 --> 01:49:46,240
like literally it's five stars,
one star or five stars.

2752
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:48,010
And I

2753
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:49,720
promise,
cause it's like this is not what country

2754
01:49:49,721 --> 01:49:50,411
means.
You're supposed to be,

2755
01:49:50,411 --> 01:49:52,280
you can't curse in country.
And,

2756
01:49:52,650 --> 01:49:55,360
and I'm telling you right now,
those one star fuckers are selling my

2757
01:49:55,361 --> 01:49:59,520
album way more than the five star cars.
They're telling what was like from that

2758
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:00,520
private parts,
you know,

2759
01:50:00,521 --> 01:50:04,510
it's like the f I'm paraphrasing,
but the five star people are telling

2760
01:50:04,511 --> 01:50:05,810
three friends,
the one start,

2761
01:50:05,811 --> 01:50:07,590
people are telling 20 friends,
you know,

2762
01:50:07,591 --> 01:50:10,660
and they're the ones getting the word
out because I don't know why they think

2763
01:50:10,661 --> 01:50:15,100
it's so no one I love,
I love country music so much,

2764
01:50:15,101 --> 01:50:17,950
you know,
and those are my heroes so much that I

2765
01:50:17,951 --> 01:50:22,060
hate to see what's happening to it.
And then those fuckers who listened to

2766
01:50:22,061 --> 01:50:26,890
this dog shit,
fucking pop rap garbage are yelling at

2767
01:50:26,891 --> 01:50:29,320
me that I'm disrespecting country music.
I go,

2768
01:50:29,321 --> 01:50:30,790
this is fucking country music.

2769
01:50:30,820 --> 01:50:32,470
You know,
if you don't like I can,

2770
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:34,300
if you don't like the word fuck or shit,
you know that's fine.

2771
01:50:34,330 --> 01:50:35,620
That's has nothing to do with what I'm
doing.

2772
01:50:35,770 --> 01:50:40,630
But if you think that it's legit because
I'm cursing or talking about fucking

2773
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:42,040
sucking dicks.
Yeah.

2774
01:50:42,041 --> 01:50:47,041
Or like there's family trees,
a song about a girl that I liked your

2775
01:50:47,171 --> 01:50:49,780
sister better but then you like you do
is you just add to,

2776
01:50:49,790 --> 01:50:52,240
you know,
it's like a dating this girl but I want

2777
01:50:52,241 --> 01:50:54,010
to fuck her sister.
But then of course I take it a step

2778
01:50:54,011 --> 01:50:55,030
further.
You know what?

2779
01:50:55,031 --> 01:50:56,800
Fuck you,
I'd rather fuck your uncle and your

2780
01:50:56,801 --> 01:50:59,560
fucking dead.
You Lick Your fucking dad's ball,

2781
01:50:59,561 --> 01:51:01,030
you know,
and then you go crazy and it's like,

2782
01:51:01,780 --> 01:51:02,531
Geez,
you're not,

2783
01:51:02,531 --> 01:51:04,900
you don't really want to do that,
but just funny to think about it.

2784
01:51:05,190 --> 01:51:08,690
Then you go over toward the song and of
course you know the players and I was

2785
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:10,080
like,
what the fuck are you saying that?

2786
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:14,210
But it does make the point.
I mean it's a song on here called can't

2787
01:51:14,211 --> 01:51:15,900
fuck you off my mind.
How many?

2788
01:51:16,330 --> 01:51:17,840
Like it's just like,
it's just a,

2789
01:51:17,841 --> 01:51:19,930
can't drink you off my mind with they
used to say,

2790
01:51:19,931 --> 01:51:22,150
and now it's like you've been through
that.

2791
01:51:22,780 --> 01:51:24,880
Everyone,
everyone's had a heartbreak,

2792
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:27,160
but you know,
and you try to fuck some other girls to

2793
01:51:27,161 --> 01:51:29,200
get over it and you're,
all you're doing is thinking about the

2794
01:51:29,201 --> 01:51:33,550
first girl I tried to fuck a bunch of
girls and it never works it to know what

2795
01:51:33,551 --> 01:51:36,160
else could works.
You got to fuck the right girls.

2796
01:51:36,190 --> 01:51:38,260
Well I fucked the wrong ones,
but you fucked the right ones.

2797
01:51:38,261 --> 01:51:40,150
You don't even care about the other one.
Well you,

2798
01:51:40,151 --> 01:51:43,000
but don't you think that's something
people can relate to at the very least.

2799
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:46,000
So they can't sing about that.
And the other thing too is one

2800
01:51:46,570 --> 01:51:49,040
mainstream press,
especially except for a few places

2801
01:51:49,070 --> 01:51:51,700
pretty much like there's no reviews of
it really anywhere.

2802
01:51:51,970 --> 01:51:54,040
But one guy wrote a review.
I thought it was pretty interesting.

2803
01:51:54,041 --> 01:51:57,340
He actually used that [inaudible]
Florida Georgia line as an example.

2804
01:51:57,790 --> 01:52:00,160
Um,
I wish I could remember who it was.

2805
01:52:00,161 --> 01:52:03,700
It might've been a blog called state and
country music.

2806
01:52:03,701 --> 01:52:06,670
I think it's what it was.
And they use an example of a floor of

2807
01:52:06,671 --> 01:52:10,450
Georgia line lyric that was like in,
you were talking about sticking my pink

2808
01:52:10,451 --> 01:52:14,020
and your stride was like kind of
talking.

2809
01:52:14,021 --> 01:52:16,960
He was saying the article about how like
these mainstream guys who talked this

2810
01:52:16,961 --> 01:52:20,980
dirty shit but co sugarcoat it and
little girls are hearing it.

2811
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:23,550
What did they say?
I don't know exactly what,

2812
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:26,050
I don't know the actual lyric but it was
kind of gross.

2813
01:52:26,051 --> 01:52:27,940
But that they do that to have it
censored.

2814
01:52:28,420 --> 01:52:30,280
Kevin,
not to have it be played on the radio so

2815
01:52:30,281 --> 01:52:32,590
they can make money.
So what I'm doing as much better,

2816
01:52:32,591 --> 01:52:35,830
because I'm saying this is for adults,
the CD,

2817
01:52:35,910 --> 01:52:38,430
I mean the CD and the online has the
sticker on it.

2818
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:39,300
Adults,
you know,

2819
01:52:39,350 --> 01:52:40,183
parents,
little visor

2820
01:52:41,590 --> 01:52:43,630
don't yell at them.
They're the ones trying to give it to

2821
01:52:43,631 --> 01:52:44,890
kids.
This is for adults.

2822
01:52:44,891 --> 01:52:46,220
I'm saying that since the fucking

2823
01:52:46,690 --> 01:52:48,290
weekend.
Don't worry about the criticism,

2824
01:52:48,310 --> 01:52:49,880
but also I'm happy.
I'm just happy you're doing it.

2825
01:52:49,910 --> 01:52:51,320
And he was,
he was saying in a positive way,

2826
01:52:51,321 --> 01:52:52,970
by the way,
but I liked the belt buckle too,

2827
01:52:52,971 --> 01:52:54,020
by the way.
She saw those.

2828
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:55,483
Yeah.
Well,

2829
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:57,650
do you think I fucking lost it?
People would buy those.

2830
01:52:57,710 --> 01:52:59,600
You should have that Wheeler Walker
bellport new.

2831
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:00,640
What's cool.
Tell me,

2832
01:53:00,660 --> 01:53:03,410
talk about that shirt too.
Is that just a single dubby right?

2833
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:04,011
Well,
yeah,

2834
01:53:04,011 --> 01:53:04,844
they didn't,
they,

2835
01:53:04,900 --> 01:53:07,070
I want to make,
I want to make a wwe junior.

2836
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:07,820
Well,
you need to,

2837
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:08,653
uh,
uh,

2838
01:53:08,810 --> 01:53:10,590
a big heart or something.
Yeah.

2839
01:53:10,591 --> 01:53:12,170
I need to are,
um,

2840
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:16,850
that she,
that shirt was made for me by the,

2841
01:53:16,851 --> 01:53:20,630
uh,
in California by the nudies t you

2842
01:53:20,631 --> 01:53:24,260
remember nudies this old nudie suits
that they used to wear in the 60s.

2843
01:53:24,261 --> 01:53:26,520
You guys remember that duties,
it sounds like.

2844
01:53:26,630 --> 01:53:28,490
Does this guy,
I think he was,

2845
01:53:28,990 --> 01:53:30,800
I think it's Ralph annuity.
He still,

2846
01:53:30,950 --> 01:53:33,550
he made the suits that you would see in
the old western movies,

2847
01:53:33,580 --> 01:53:37,400
how you spell it and you die like a
Nudie magazine.

2848
01:53:37,850 --> 01:53:38,571
Yeah.
And he would,

2849
01:53:38,571 --> 01:53:40,490
uh,
make these nudie suits at like buck

2850
01:53:40,491 --> 01:53:41,780
owens and people like that.
Well,

2851
01:53:41,781 --> 01:53:43,970
what happened was they used to be in the
old westerns,

2852
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:47,990
um,
these crazy suits and people like elvis

2853
01:53:47,991 --> 01:53:49,880
or Johnny Cash used to watch those
westerns.

2854
01:53:49,881 --> 01:53:51,410
They go,
they started calling this guy there.

2855
01:53:51,630 --> 01:53:52,620
Orbison.
Yeah.

2856
01:53:53,410 --> 01:53:57,590
What's his name is
Ralph annuity.

2857
01:53:57,591 --> 01:53:58,620
So,
so these,

2858
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:01,080
these people like elvis or Johnny Cash,
Hank Williams,

2859
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:02,060
even they would call,
they're like,

2860
01:54:02,090 --> 01:54:03,800
I want a suit.
Like they will warren,

2861
01:54:03,830 --> 01:54:04,700
you know,
whatever.

2862
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:08,330
Western movie.
And then he started making clothes for

2863
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:10,220
musicians.
Dolly Parton's there.

2864
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:12,740
Who's that dude right there?
Barry Klein,

2865
01:54:13,700 --> 01:54:15,620
who's barely climb that?
Patsy cline's dad.

2866
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:18,940
I Dunno,
there's grand and back there.

2867
01:54:19,580 --> 01:54:20,900
Um,
anyway,

2868
01:54:20,901 --> 01:54:24,830
but I guess his grant or somebody kept
it going and I,

2869
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:27,120
they,
they reopened in La for a little,

2870
01:54:27,150 --> 01:54:28,580
I think they're back out of business.
I didn't,

2871
01:54:28,581 --> 01:54:30,780
I'm not sure,
but that's an actual annuity.

2872
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:35,120
A shirt wow.
Made for me at the fucking Taylor.

2873
01:54:35,121 --> 01:54:37,220
And everything costs more than a fucking
record.

2874
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:38,450
That's amazing.
Oh yeah,

2875
01:54:38,451 --> 01:54:40,130
there it is.
I love shit like that.

2876
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:41,720
Nudies Rodeo.
Taylor's,

2877
01:54:42,020 --> 01:54:44,180
Hollywood,
California with the credit side too.

2878
01:54:44,181 --> 01:54:46,310
Yeah.
So those are still around.

2879
01:54:46,910 --> 01:54:48,320
Well I think they're bringing it back.
Yeah.

2880
01:54:48,490 --> 01:54:50,960
I have tee shirts that go and read Ed
Hardy on yet they're going to have

2881
01:54:50,961 --> 01:54:52,490
glitter.
It's going to be glitter on those

2882
01:54:52,491 --> 01:54:53,400
fucking tee.
But anyway,

2883
01:54:53,401 --> 01:54:55,190
back called the tailor and they made me
that.

2884
01:54:55,340 --> 01:54:57,440
I just wanted that.
I wanted that label on the back of the

2885
01:54:57,441 --> 01:54:58,430
Nudie.
That's pretty cool.

2886
01:54:59,450 --> 01:55:01,310
I love things like that.
You find out.

2887
01:55:01,311 --> 01:55:02,750
I think they got it.
They got a museum.

2888
01:55:02,810 --> 01:55:04,040
Yeah,
it was cool cause I just looked it up

2889
01:55:04,041 --> 01:55:06,750
like what I did was I was,
that's what's great about the Internet

2890
01:55:06,751 --> 01:55:07,610
because I looked it up.
I was like,

2891
01:55:08,060 --> 01:55:09,790
it's still kind of shirt I want for my
record coat.

2892
01:55:10,180 --> 01:55:10,850
And then I,
oh,

2893
01:55:10,850 --> 01:55:12,710
I want annuity shirt,
I look it up,

2894
01:55:12,711 --> 01:55:15,650
I'll send,
I see their website and I look at it and

2895
01:55:15,651 --> 01:55:17,600
you can get one made.
But you know,

2896
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:21,200
it's just that.
It's just that I don't want it one lock

2897
01:55:21,201 --> 01:55:21,880
it.
I just want,

2898
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:22,820
I want hit.
No,

2899
01:55:22,821 --> 01:55:23,690
that's cool.
Yeah,

2900
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:25,310
it's interesting.
He should do that.

2901
01:55:25,311 --> 01:55:27,720
But he used to like soup up.
Like Elvis has cars and shit.

2902
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:29,160
Really?
Yeah.

2903
01:55:29,161 --> 01:55:33,260
There's nudies did a bunch of car shit
where you had elvis had a souped up car.

2904
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:34,770
Yeah,
but he had what they did though.

2905
01:55:34,771 --> 01:55:35,830
Suits.
They would do what to car.

2906
01:55:35,831 --> 01:55:38,300
It's like horns coming out of it and
glitter and all that.

2907
01:55:38,310 --> 01:55:40,100
Fuck yeah.
That's hilarious.

2908
01:55:40,101 --> 01:55:41,770
Look at this thing.
So there's that.

2909
01:55:41,780 --> 01:55:43,530
That's a famous,
that's that famous elvis suit.

2910
01:55:43,531 --> 01:55:46,140
He made it.
He made elvis a gold shiny suit.

2911
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:48,480
Yeah.
What is the one with the car though?

2912
01:55:48,481 --> 01:55:50,400
Go back to that car.
That's hilarious.

2913
01:55:50,490 --> 01:55:53,730
It's Elvis had you imagine driving that
Cadillac?

2914
01:55:55,140 --> 01:55:56,640
It was on Elvis.
Who said that?

2915
01:55:56,650 --> 01:55:58,170
The nudie car,
it might be his,

2916
01:55:58,750 --> 01:56:00,060
he was at his car.
I don't know.

2917
01:56:00,090 --> 01:56:02,460
Maybe it was so he designed a thing.
Didn't go,

2918
01:56:02,461 --> 01:56:04,530
there's a museum around here somewhere
you can go to chicken out.

2919
01:56:04,590 --> 01:56:08,220
I wonder if that was his,
but that that's why is your a rifle look

2920
01:56:08,221 --> 01:56:09,690
at,
there's a rifle back there.

2921
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:12,210
He'll how to put it was a rifle.

2922
01:56:12,210 --> 01:56:14,400
Goose cattle car.
Two rifles on the sides,

2923
01:56:14,401 --> 01:56:18,450
but one of them that's in like a firing
position to shoot at people behind you.

2924
01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:19,763
Well,
when I make,

2925
01:56:20,070 --> 01:56:23,790
what the fuck is that man?
If your fans,

2926
01:56:23,830 --> 01:56:25,200
hey,
I'll make a promise right here.

2927
01:56:25,201 --> 01:56:26,760
If I get to number one,
I'm wearing that.

2928
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:29,230
I'm wearing a nudie suit nonstop for a
fucking week.

2929
01:56:30,110 --> 01:56:30,930
A whole week.
I should,

2930
01:56:30,930 --> 01:56:32,460
I take it back a year,
a year,

2931
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:34,020
a year.
I like I like a year,

2932
01:56:34,050 --> 01:56:38,430
but I'm a number one top tour.
I'll tour with an owl cause that knows

2933
01:56:38,431 --> 01:56:41,880
nudie suits cost fucking five grand.
I feel like people are just finding out

2934
01:56:41,881 --> 01:56:43,650
about you.
I feel like this just,

2935
01:56:43,651 --> 01:56:45,480
this rise just started for you.
Well,

2936
01:56:45,481 --> 01:56:47,070
that's what happened.
Like I was saying,

2937
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:49,380
when it debuted so high,
I went home and I was like,

2938
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:50,780
that's crazy.
That debut until I,

2939
01:56:50,781 --> 01:56:52,290
then you get hungry,
you go home and you're like,

2940
01:56:52,890 --> 01:56:53,310
fuck him.

2941
01:56:53,310 --> 01:56:56,190
Even worse up their ass.
I'm going to go and a tour.

2942
01:56:56,191 --> 01:56:58,170
I'm going to do the video.
I'm going to go for it now.

2943
01:56:58,290 --> 01:56:59,041
Well,
people just,

2944
01:56:59,041 --> 01:57:00,690
I think a lot of people don't even know
about you yet.

2945
01:57:00,691 --> 01:57:01,740
I really do.
You know,

2946
01:57:01,741 --> 01:57:04,860
and hopefully this podcast and with some
other podcasts and all the youtube

2947
01:57:04,861 --> 01:57:06,240
videos and between the,
yeah,

2948
01:57:06,241 --> 01:57:08,580
you helping out and you know,
I appreciate it again,

2949
01:57:08,581 --> 01:57:10,380
coming on the show,
it had a fucking blast,

2950
01:57:10,381 --> 01:57:10,881
man.
My man,

2951
01:57:10,881 --> 01:57:13,660
it's fun shit.
And I love that you're a fan.

2952
01:57:13,830 --> 01:57:15,870
You know,
I love that there's places like this

2953
01:57:15,871 --> 01:57:18,660
where I can fucking talk about it.
I love that there was two,

2954
01:57:18,661 --> 01:57:21,420
I don't know even know how it happened.
I wish I could say that I planned this

2955
01:57:21,421 --> 01:57:23,760
whole thing out.
This is all total dumb luck.

2956
01:57:24,110 --> 01:57:26,090
Yeah.
You have anyone who I've,

2957
01:57:26,430 --> 01:57:29,460
anyone who happens upon my record,
if they find me,

2958
01:57:29,461 --> 01:57:32,300
I just,
I mean you gotta,

2959
01:57:32,550 --> 01:57:34,230
you know,
one of the biggest podcast in the world,

2960
01:57:34,231 --> 01:57:36,720
but even if just,
I've done interviews with people just

2961
01:57:36,721 --> 01:57:37,440
like,
I liked the record.

2962
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:41,500
Will you be on my fucking podcast?
And we've got like 30 fucking live.

2963
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:43,080
I'll do it.
If they're that big a fan,

2964
01:57:43,081 --> 01:57:44,420
I don't give a shit.
Oh that's cool.

2965
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:45,590
Yeah.
Yeah.

2966
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:47,910
Well that's going to change the,
once you run out of time,

2967
01:57:47,911 --> 01:57:52,110
fuck those folks can get too many beam.
It's going to be Joe Rogan only soon.

2968
01:57:52,111 --> 01:57:53,960
But uh,
there's a lot of other cool ones you've

2969
01:57:53,961 --> 01:57:57,930
got to do like Bert Kreischer and do as
many people as you can around town.

2970
01:57:58,110 --> 01:57:59,160
Yeah.
While I'm here and not playing

2971
01:57:59,161 --> 01:58:00,600
Coachella,
I may as well do the whole fucking

2972
01:58:00,601 --> 01:58:01,800
round.
It's hilarious.

2973
01:58:01,801 --> 01:58:03,390
At coachella.
Thought you were too risky.

2974
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:05,340
Yeah,
I would love to see you up there.

2975
01:58:05,341 --> 01:58:06,150
You won't push.
You know,

2976
01:58:06,150 --> 01:58:08,220
I think it is kicking in.
I think part of it is,

2977
01:58:08,850 --> 01:58:11,700
it's like in the kind of,
I think it's cause it's country and it's

2978
01:58:11,701 --> 01:58:12,750
just so weird to hear.

2979
01:58:12,780 --> 01:58:15,710
And also when it's,
it's not as loud so that every,

2980
01:58:15,750 --> 01:58:18,980
all the bad words are so fucking clear
and you can hear it so well.

2981
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:21,780
Like when you sync clip,
you can really hear it.

2982
01:58:21,810 --> 01:58:25,140
I just would love to see all those
fucking hipsters that are just going to,

2983
01:58:25,141 --> 01:58:27,060
the cool thing,
like people were like,

2984
01:58:27,061 --> 01:58:28,440
we're here for,
the cool thing was I was going to

2985
01:58:28,450 --> 01:58:29,640
Coachella.
But that's,

2986
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:32,310
that's the whole fuck that's,
it's,

2987
01:58:32,370 --> 01:58:33,990
it's,
it's funny you brought that up.

2988
01:58:35,430 --> 01:58:36,101
No,
but seriously,

2989
01:58:36,101 --> 01:58:37,380
it's,
I'm glad you brought that up because

2990
01:58:37,381 --> 01:58:40,680
part of the point of this record to was
to piss off everybody.

2991
01:58:40,681 --> 01:58:41,920
I want it,
you know,

2992
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:45,160
my redneck friends back home,
I wanted them to get pissed off by this.

2993
01:58:45,250 --> 01:58:47,080
I wanted the hipsters to get pissed off
by,

2994
01:58:47,090 --> 01:58:47,500
you know,
the,

2995
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:49,150
you know,
like there's something to piss off

2996
01:58:49,151 --> 01:58:49,990
everybody.
Right.

2997
01:58:49,991 --> 01:58:53,230
So the goal was again,
talking about thinking no one's gonna

2998
01:58:53,231 --> 01:58:55,270
hear.
The goal was to fucking make sure nobody

2999
01:58:55,271 --> 01:58:57,880
bought it.
I did everything in my power to make

3000
01:58:57,881 --> 01:59:00,590
sure no one would listen to it.
And I think yes,

3001
01:59:01,940 --> 01:59:03,210
the key,
you know,

3002
01:59:03,211 --> 01:59:05,320
cause there's something to piss off
everyone on here.

3003
01:59:05,460 --> 01:59:07,110
What's this?
It's a hilarious idea.

3004
01:59:07,170 --> 01:59:08,640
The whole idea behind.
It's Hilarious,

3005
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:10,350
but I think people get it

3006
01:59:10,380 --> 01:59:11,250
that it's re,
you know,

3007
01:59:11,940 --> 01:59:14,010
it's,
you can't make music like this.

3008
01:59:14,011 --> 01:59:16,310
That sounds like that.
If it's not coming from a real fucking

3009
01:59:17,130 --> 01:59:17,963
place,
you know,

3010
01:59:18,030 --> 01:59:18,990
I think,
yeah,

3011
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:19,610
I'm going,
I,

3012
01:59:19,610 --> 01:59:21,590
and I think this,
this kind of stuff on,

3013
01:59:21,591 --> 01:59:22,780
I mean,
it's going to sound grander,

3014
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:24,870
ridiculous,
but I think this ushers in the future,

3015
01:59:25,260 --> 01:59:30,260
because it's proving
people like a lot of stuff that you're

3016
01:59:31,051 --> 01:59:33,480
not going to get it from these
mainstream purveyors.

3017
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:36,090
You're just not going to get it from the
not going to risk it.

3018
01:59:36,150 --> 01:59:38,250
They're not going to put the money out
for something like this because they

3019
01:59:38,251 --> 01:59:41,460
can't sell it to the radio stations.
They can't do what they normally do.

3020
01:59:41,461 --> 01:59:43,140
They don't have a place for it.
They don't know what it is.

3021
01:59:43,230 --> 01:59:45,000
So then you come along and you do it on
your own.

3022
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:49,080
It takes off like a fucking wildfire and
that now they're scrambling.

3023
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:53,130
Like you must be getting a lot of
mainstream music producer guys and

3024
01:59:53,131 --> 01:59:55,500
executives that are coming.
You trying to get in on this.

3025
01:59:55,660 --> 01:59:56,291
Oh,
totally.

3026
01:59:56,291 --> 01:59:57,400
And I tell,
you know what?

3027
01:59:57,850 --> 02:00:01,390
You always got to remember what the,
like we talking about,

3028
02:00:01,391 --> 02:00:03,040
don't give a fuck.
You got to keep that attitude.

3029
02:00:03,041 --> 02:00:06,570
Or you're going to fall down the fucking
drag you into the fucking the dental

3030
02:00:06,590 --> 02:00:08,050
staff.
This is going to be like,

3031
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:09,760
and listen,
I like money.

3032
02:00:09,790 --> 02:00:11,350
We all like money,
but they're going to go,

3033
02:00:11,351 --> 02:00:13,990
hey,
if you tone down a little on the next

3034
02:00:13,991 --> 02:00:15,490
one,
we can get you on whatever.

3035
02:00:15,491 --> 02:00:18,070
You know,
we can get you on MTV or cnt or whatever

3036
02:00:18,071 --> 02:00:20,170
it is.
And then I'll go and then like,

3037
02:00:20,171 --> 02:00:22,190
you know,
that'll be 10 times the money and then

3038
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:24,160
you know,
I'll think about it.

3039
02:00:24,161 --> 02:00:26,140
Don't get me wrong,
but I just got to stick with,

3040
02:00:27,020 --> 02:00:28,790
listen,
if I don't think they're wrong though,

3041
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:30,650
they might.
It might be 10 times the money right

3042
02:00:30,651 --> 02:00:33,710
now.
But I think in the future this is going

3043
02:00:33,711 --> 02:00:35,900
to be giant.
I don't give a fucking shit if it

3044
02:00:35,930 --> 02:00:39,350
doesn't beat.
So that's good it because if I'm not

3045
02:00:39,351 --> 02:00:41,090
doing it the way I want it,
then I'll be miserable.

3046
02:00:41,150 --> 02:00:42,770
But because you are doing it the way you
want it,

3047
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:44,810
it's fucking hilarious.
So like what,

3048
02:00:44,840 --> 02:00:46,370
what kind of people,
you don't have to name names,

3049
02:00:46,371 --> 02:00:49,580
but like what kind of people have come
up to you and tried to get in on this?

3050
02:00:49,820 --> 02:00:53,000
What kind of music?
Executive type characters

3051
02:00:53,490 --> 02:00:55,770
I'll say.
And I'm talking about country stars and

3052
02:00:55,771 --> 02:00:59,070
country exec in music executives.
I won't name names.

3053
02:00:59,100 --> 02:01:01,120
The biggest of the biggest and I,
I,

3054
02:01:01,630 --> 02:01:04,500
I'm not going to name names but I'm
talking about the biggest stars in

3055
02:01:04,501 --> 02:01:08,370
country have contacted me,
you know,

3056
02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:11,970
well a couple of different things that
I've heard through the grapevine cause I

3057
02:01:11,971 --> 02:01:13,620
don't,
I don't travel in those circles,

3058
02:01:13,980 --> 02:01:15,840
but some people who really love it,
some people,

3059
02:01:16,470 --> 02:01:20,010
some people are not untrue.
Joke have reached out to friends of mine

3060
02:01:20,011 --> 02:01:24,240
who know me making sure that I don't
shit on that because I talk shit about

3061
02:01:24,241 --> 02:01:26,540
everybody and they're like,
couldn't you tell him I'm cool because

3062
02:01:26,570 --> 02:01:30,640
it wasn't shit on me.
And a couple of people have come up with

3063
02:01:30,670 --> 02:01:33,480
some of the big boys and I'm and some
things that wouldn't even my name but

3064
02:01:33,510 --> 02:01:36,840
they don't want,
it's funny too cause I have some fans

3065
02:01:36,841 --> 02:01:40,130
who are literally the biggest country
stars on planet who won't

3066
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:44,810
say that there until it becomes okay to
say it.

3067
02:01:44,811 --> 02:01:46,610
They're not saying it right.
They said it to my face.

3068
02:01:46,611 --> 02:01:48,290
I've literally met them and they've said
it to my face,

3069
02:01:48,470 --> 02:01:52,910
but they won't say it anywhere because
they don't want to lose their fucking

3070
02:01:53,750 --> 02:01:54,950
fans.
Like once it becomes,

3071
02:01:54,951 --> 02:01:57,020
if it becomes mainstream,
which I hope it doesn't,

3072
02:01:57,230 --> 02:02:00,410
but if it does maybe it will be cool.
You know what's mainstream though?

3073
02:02:00,411 --> 02:02:02,810
Who the fuck?
There's no mainstream anymore.

3074
02:02:02,811 --> 02:02:04,610
Mainstream used to be radio and
television.

3075
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:07,520
Nobody gives a fuck.
So tonight show anymore.

3076
02:02:07,550 --> 02:02:09,860
Someone Dean on the tonight show for a
band.

3077
02:02:09,861 --> 02:02:11,150
Does that mean anything anymore?
They were,

3078
02:02:11,660 --> 02:02:12,890
they were talking to me about that,
you know,

3079
02:02:12,891 --> 02:02:15,290
because one thing you do is play late
night shows and they're like they ain't

3080
02:02:15,291 --> 02:02:15,951
going to have you.
I was like,

3081
02:02:15,951 --> 02:02:17,270
I don't give a fuck.
What did they mean?

3082
02:02:17,270 --> 02:02:19,940
Anything anymore now.
It used to be if you did like the

3083
02:02:19,941 --> 02:02:24,050
tonight show like you,
but then once it changed in like the

3084
02:02:24,050 --> 02:02:27,470
nineties like it started going away and
like the 90s and the two thousands they

3085
02:02:27,471 --> 02:02:29,080
were telling me that the numbers that
are even,

3086
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:30,770
they're like,
you can't do obviously those big

3087
02:02:30,771 --> 02:02:32,510
talkers,
but they're saying you don't fucking,

3088
02:02:32,570 --> 02:02:34,490
those numbers don't.
It's like I'm moving the needle.

3089
02:02:34,910 --> 02:02:38,180
It's better than your podcasts going to
move to need a lot more than any fucking

3090
02:02:38,181 --> 02:02:39,320
talk show.
I guarantee you that.

3091
02:02:39,350 --> 02:02:41,000
That's bizarre.
Well,

3092
02:02:41,030 --> 02:02:41,440
you know,
I,

3093
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:42,830
I don't get,
I hope I'm right,

3094
02:02:42,831 --> 02:02:43,820
but I think you're right.
I,

3095
02:02:43,821 --> 02:02:46,290
but I'm almost positive.
I heard it about books and other people

3096
02:02:46,291 --> 02:02:48,800
see positive.
I'm positive.

3097
02:02:48,801 --> 02:02:50,780
I'm right.
And I sterns play it a couple times,

3098
02:02:50,781 --> 02:02:53,060
you know,
like that shit so much bigger than doing

3099
02:02:53,061 --> 02:02:57,200
a fucking a tonight show or you know,
whatever those shows are,

3100
02:02:57,290 --> 02:02:57,950
which is enough.

3101
02:02:57,950 --> 02:02:59,300
I mind if I'm in town,
they want me to play,

3102
02:02:59,301 --> 02:03:01,370
I'll do it,
but they can't have me on.

3103
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:03,140
So it doesn't matter.
They can't have you on.

3104
02:03:03,141 --> 02:03:05,570
And one of the problems with those shows
is like say you know,

3105
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:08,900
no offense to any of these guys,
but say if Konan has someone on a show

3106
02:03:08,901 --> 02:03:12,380
that's a band,
I don't know how much input Konan has or

3107
02:03:12,381 --> 02:03:14,810
like maybe the tonight show,
Jimmy Fallon.

3108
02:03:14,811 --> 02:03:17,060
How much input does he have on what the
guests are?

3109
02:03:17,090 --> 02:03:19,250
I don't know.
I letterman I was told was the one who

3110
02:03:19,251 --> 02:03:21,590
really did like was like real country.
He was,

3111
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:23,900
that was always the place where like
actual,

3112
02:03:23,901 --> 02:03:27,140
like Isabel played there,
you know like he would,

3113
02:03:27,590 --> 02:03:29,570
and Jason Isbell also is on an
independent label,

3114
02:03:29,571 --> 02:03:31,010
you know,
like it's hard for him to get on.

3115
02:03:31,011 --> 02:03:33,530
But with letterman given the approval,
you know,

3116
02:03:33,531 --> 02:03:34,240
he can get on it.

3117
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:36,340
So some of those guys have like,
some people,

3118
02:03:36,341 --> 02:03:38,180
like Jay Leno was talking to me about
this,

3119
02:03:38,181 --> 02:03:41,330
like that he hated when he was doing the
tonight show and you'd have to have some

3120
02:03:41,331 --> 02:03:44,900
guy on from some TV show that he didn't
give a fuck about and he had to pretend

3121
02:03:44,901 --> 02:03:47,060
that we care.
You'd think he'd be in a position to

3122
02:03:47,061 --> 02:03:50,960
fucking wasn't.
He was doing the most mainstream shows.

3123
02:03:50,961 --> 02:03:53,240
But that's why is because it was so
mainstream.

3124
02:03:53,241 --> 02:03:55,670
He had to be like right down the middle
like non-offensive.

3125
02:03:55,910 --> 02:03:59,020
But now he's doing his own show.
He's doing that Jay Leno's garage.

3126
02:03:59,021 --> 02:03:59,920
If you ever seen that.
No.

3127
02:03:59,921 --> 02:04:01,760
Is it good?
You get to see what Jay was like.

3128
02:04:01,820 --> 02:04:04,730
Jay Leno's no weird on my TV for 20
years.

3129
02:04:04,731 --> 02:04:06,530
I don't know what he's like.
He's a great guy.

3130
02:04:06,650 --> 02:04:08,570
He was in here.
He did a podcast with us.

3131
02:04:08,570 --> 02:04:13,250
He was fucking here talking about the
doing a show for the mob and he was

3132
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:17,530
talking about his mom heard about it.
Leno screamed you fucking Cock sucker.

3133
02:04:17,670 --> 02:04:20,540
It's,
it's bizarre like seeing him scream you

3134
02:04:20,541 --> 02:04:21,740
fucking cock sucker.
Like,

3135
02:04:21,860 --> 02:04:23,750
oh I remember hearing stories.
You know,

3136
02:04:23,751 --> 02:04:26,150
cause I obviously got,
some of my friends are musicians like

3137
02:04:26,151 --> 02:04:28,040
who they'll be playing a show and
they're like,

3138
02:04:28,100 --> 02:04:30,080
oh somebody canceled on the t is years
ago.

3139
02:04:30,110 --> 02:04:33,560
Cancel on the tonight show.
If you can get out to la.

3140
02:04:33,561 --> 02:04:36,200
He played tonight show,
you can do the show in whatever.

3141
02:04:36,350 --> 02:04:37,950
And they crunched the numbers and it
costs,

3142
02:04:38,750 --> 02:04:42,510
it's not moving in a band.
It's so expensive.

3143
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:46,620
And they crunched the numbers and it's
like it wasn't worth their money to

3144
02:04:46,621 --> 02:04:48,120
play.
Like how fucking crazy is that?

3145
02:04:48,270 --> 02:04:50,040
That's correct.
And we become a band,

3146
02:04:50,041 --> 02:04:52,380
a small band,
and it's not worth the money to play.

3147
02:04:52,380 --> 02:04:56,390
The tonight show won't get enough return
on your money and far as far as they

3148
02:04:56,400 --> 02:05:00,120
were saying that it was 40 grand to play
cars with your paying the musicians,

3149
02:05:00,160 --> 02:05:01,200
a crew,
the trucks,

3150
02:05:01,201 --> 02:05:02,950
everything and driving all the way out
there.

3151
02:05:02,951 --> 02:05:04,650
It was,
it's like you're not going to make 40

3152
02:05:04,651 --> 02:05:07,560
grand in record sale.
So just stowing weird and the old days

3153
02:05:07,561 --> 02:05:10,110
like you were saying one play on that
and you're playing arenas.

3154
02:05:10,250 --> 02:05:12,450
Yeah,
I was talking to Paul Stanley about that

3155
02:05:12,451 --> 02:05:14,610
when he was in here.
It was real weird talking to him because

3156
02:05:14,630 --> 02:05:18,690
Paul Stanley of course was a huge
superstar in the 70s and it was all

3157
02:05:18,691 --> 02:05:20,250
record sales.
And as a matter of fact,

3158
02:05:20,251 --> 02:05:22,080
they couldn't get on the radio.
You know,

3159
02:05:22,081 --> 02:05:24,030
kiss had a really hard time being on the
radio.

3160
02:05:24,031 --> 02:05:26,070
They were sorta Kinda blackballed on the
outside.

3161
02:05:26,220 --> 02:05:29,340
Oh yeah.
But just because of the love from their

3162
02:05:29,341 --> 02:05:30,174
fans.

3163
02:05:30,330 --> 02:05:33,660
They stayed valid of course.
And they sell him fucking lunchboxes and

3164
02:05:33,661 --> 02:05:35,400
dolls and weird man.
I mean,

3165
02:05:35,401 --> 02:05:37,800
when I was a kid,
like a US kiss song on the radio,

3166
02:05:37,801 --> 02:05:40,410
like it was a moment to be excited.
Oh my God,

3167
02:05:40,411 --> 02:05:43,050
they're playing kiss.
Think dawn one they've ever played was

3168
02:05:43,051 --> 02:05:44,910
Beth,
which is weird because that was the drum

3169
02:05:44,970 --> 02:05:47,910
that was a big one.
But they pay Detroit rock city

3170
02:05:47,911 --> 02:05:49,110
occasionally,
you know,

3171
02:05:49,140 --> 02:05:50,940
or I want to rock and roll all night.
They play.

3172
02:05:51,100 --> 02:05:51,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

3173
02:05:51,690 --> 02:05:54,210
Down in Kentucky for a rock city.
I'd heard on the radio before and I

3174
02:05:54,211 --> 02:05:55,950
remember being blown away like,
Whoa,

3175
02:05:55,951 --> 02:05:57,630
I can't believe they're definitely not
taking seriously.

3176
02:05:57,631 --> 02:05:58,231
Yeah,
no,

3177
02:05:58,231 --> 02:06:01,080
they weren't taken seriously,
but there are fucking great rock and

3178
02:06:01,081 --> 02:06:02,170
roll band by the way.
That's a bit,

3179
02:06:02,171 --> 02:06:04,680
not the best fucking idea.
You put your kind of the biggest rock

3180
02:06:04,681 --> 02:06:06,210
pain ever and then you put the makeup
on.

3181
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:07,650
Yeah,
go out and do whatever the fuck you

3182
02:06:07,651 --> 02:06:08,820
want.
Nobody knew who they were.

3183
02:06:08,850 --> 02:06:10,410
Yeah.
I met ace freely.

3184
02:06:10,411 --> 02:06:14,490
When I was like,
probably like before I was less than 10,

3185
02:06:14,550 --> 02:06:16,190
somewhere in that area.
Uh,

3186
02:06:16,230 --> 02:06:18,960
my uncle used to work for Howard marks
advertising,

3187
02:06:18,961 --> 02:06:21,510
which used to make all of this album
covers in New York City.

3188
02:06:21,690 --> 02:06:24,960
I'll know what yeah,
and my uncle vinny was an artist and so

3189
02:06:24,961 --> 02:06:28,140
he would him and uh,
this Guy Dennis that he worked with with

3190
02:06:28,141 --> 02:06:33,000
do these albums like destroyer,
I'll have to kill her car too.

3191
02:06:33,001 --> 02:06:34,980
Like some of the all time great ones.
They did kiss,

3192
02:06:35,400 --> 02:06:37,130
kiss double platinum.
They were really excited.

3193
02:06:37,190 --> 02:06:40,590
So I would get advanced copies of this
shit when I was a little kid.

3194
02:06:41,100 --> 02:06:43,910
I can't even imagine what getting an
advanced copy of record was when you're,

3195
02:06:44,250 --> 02:06:45,960
oh my God,
it wasn't something I would have known.

3196
02:06:45,960 --> 02:06:49,250
What an advance copy.
Like you probably look it up.

3197
02:06:49,270 --> 02:06:51,810
Yeah,
my uncle was involved with that.

3198
02:06:51,811 --> 02:06:53,430
And who's involved at a couple of other
ones?

3199
02:06:53,431 --> 02:06:54,264
Man.
Is that the name?

3200
02:06:54,270 --> 02:06:56,460
There's a name there only.
I don't know who the guy who did the

3201
02:06:56,461 --> 02:06:57,950
painting was my,
you know,

3202
02:06:58,020 --> 02:06:59,520
I think they hired someone to do the
painting,

3203
02:06:59,690 --> 02:07:04,170
but there what the advertising agency
would do was designed like the inside of

3204
02:07:04,171 --> 02:07:05,580
it,
like graphic design,

3205
02:07:05,581 --> 02:07:08,640
put all the photos and place and decide
how the font would look and all that

3206
02:07:08,641 --> 02:07:10,050
stuff.
It was really cool.

3207
02:07:10,051 --> 02:07:13,080
So when I was a kid that he would send
me these posters.

3208
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:16,380
My mom just had them recently.
I beat these fucking,

3209
02:07:16,410 --> 02:07:18,450
when they had their solo albums,
you know,

3210
02:07:18,451 --> 02:07:22,440
they all have a individual hour.
I had the actual posters from the

3211
02:07:22,441 --> 02:07:23,730
fucking way.
Yeah.

3212
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:26,940
I had each one.
I think each record was dedicated to the

3213
02:07:26,941 --> 02:07:27,420
other three.

3214
02:07:27,420 --> 02:07:28,780
Right.
Well I was,

3215
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:33,880
it was it on the bag.
It's like dedicated to Paul a gene and

3216
02:07:34,591 --> 02:07:37,300
you know that's a creepy ass fucking
songs.

3217
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:40,070
Yeah,
it was gene Simmons said to Christine 16

3218
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:41,790
they came back around.
It became,

3219
02:07:42,180 --> 02:07:44,480
yeah,
you got to watch that shit.

3220
02:07:44,580 --> 02:07:45,341
Got To wash.
I said,

3221
02:07:45,341 --> 02:07:47,020
no,
you couldn't have a song about a 16 year

3222
02:07:47,021 --> 02:07:49,660
old that you have to fuck us and I've
got to have you.

3223
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:54,160
I got an idea for us to,
what is it?

3224
02:07:55,090 --> 02:07:55,751
Don't say it.
No,

3225
02:07:55,751 --> 02:07:58,780
hold on dude.
Just take a take a breath and know what

3226
02:07:58,781 --> 02:07:59,770
you're going to say.
I taught,

3227
02:07:59,890 --> 02:08:00,750
taught me out of it.
No,

3228
02:08:00,770 --> 02:08:01,480
no,
no.

3229
02:08:01,480 --> 02:08:04,150
There was a couple of good songs off
from the soul albums back in the New

3230
02:08:04,150 --> 02:08:05,020
York group.
That was a good age.

3231
02:08:05,021 --> 02:08:06,790
Freely Song.
But that was from the silhouette.

3232
02:08:06,850 --> 02:08:07,683
Yeah.
Yeah.

3233
02:08:07,750 --> 02:08:08,780
Back in the New York group.

3234
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:11,890
Unheralded Song.
Aces Solo record was the best of the

3235
02:08:11,900 --> 02:08:13,240
solid ones.
Yeah.

3236
02:08:13,960 --> 02:08:16,570
I don't remember him that well,
but I remember liking that one the best.

3237
02:08:16,870 --> 02:08:18,310
I'd have to go back and listen to them
again.

3238
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:21,850
Remember they did a little disco and for
awhile like I was made for loving you.

3239
02:08:22,210 --> 02:08:24,280
They went disco people make fun.
I kinda like,

3240
02:08:24,300 --> 02:08:26,350
I mean looking back,
it was getting kinda good at the time

3241
02:08:26,351 --> 02:08:28,060
you hit song.
I love that song.

3242
02:08:28,210 --> 02:08:29,490
Yeah.
Ooh,

3243
02:08:30,850 --> 02:08:33,100
I want a disco shit.
That was so shitty.

3244
02:08:33,130 --> 02:08:34,240
You listen to me now.
It sounds,

3245
02:08:35,050 --> 02:08:37,960
everything in,
in looking back it was like,

3246
02:08:38,590 --> 02:08:43,030
now that music has gotten so shitty,
I mean bg sound fucking likely the best

3247
02:08:43,031 --> 02:08:45,010
band you ever heard.
Well that's what's interesting is I

3248
02:08:45,011 --> 02:08:49,210
think they were unjustly criticized.
Like if you listened to their style of

3249
02:08:49,211 --> 02:08:50,910
music,
um,

3250
02:08:51,010 --> 02:08:53,230
they had some really good songs.

3251
02:08:53,230 --> 02:08:55,680
The bgs had some interesting songs.
I can,

3252
02:08:55,730 --> 02:08:57,200
I can name,
you know,

3253
02:08:57,220 --> 02:09:00,220
but there's,
I can name you 20 killer bg songs and

3254
02:09:00,221 --> 02:09:01,480
that's another thing too.
You know,

3255
02:09:01,510 --> 02:09:03,310
it's important.
It sounds like you're,

3256
02:09:03,340 --> 02:09:04,270
you're with me.
Yeah.

3257
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:08,320
Was Not all kinds of music.
I love all kinds of people that make the

3258
02:09:08,321 --> 02:09:11,410
shitty country that we were pointing out
before all they listened to his pop

3259
02:09:11,411 --> 02:09:13,060
country.
That's all I listen to the people.

3260
02:09:13,540 --> 02:09:16,690
I was reading an interview with prince
once and he was,

3261
02:09:17,470 --> 02:09:19,360
I don't remember exactly what he said,
but he's talking about how much you

3262
02:09:19,361 --> 02:09:22,090
loved
James Brown.

3263
02:09:22,091 --> 02:09:24,190
He in later in the interview he talks
about Joni Mitchell,

3264
02:09:24,191 --> 02:09:26,490
how much you love Joni Mitchell.
That's how you become prints,

3265
02:09:26,580 --> 02:09:28,690
right when you love James Brown and Joni
Mitchell.

3266
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,730
Cause it's two completely different
things.

3267
02:09:30,731 --> 02:09:32,590
And then it comes out through prince as
something,

3268
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:36,010
but if he only listened to James Brown,
it just sounded like a James Brown repo.

3269
02:09:36,310 --> 02:09:39,200
It's the other,
the folk music and the Weird Shit that

3270
02:09:39,201 --> 02:09:41,270
you listened to that made him such a
fucking kid.

3271
02:09:41,271 --> 02:09:43,780
Man.
I think music is a lot like everything

3272
02:09:43,781 --> 02:09:46,150
else.
Like I like variety and all kinds of

3273
02:09:46,151 --> 02:09:50,320
different foods.
I like variety and art and architecture

3274
02:09:50,321 --> 02:09:53,800
and I like variety and music.
It's interesting to hear like more than

3275
02:09:53,801 --> 02:09:56,140
a woman.
That is a good fucking song.

3276
02:09:56,170 --> 02:09:57,810
That bg song.
Good.

3277
02:09:58,510 --> 02:10:00,430
When you saw it in that movie,
Saturday night fever,

3278
02:10:00,850 --> 02:10:03,730
it's a great fun try not dance into
staying alive.

3279
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:05,260
That's right.
That's what I'm talking about.

3280
02:10:05,290 --> 02:10:07,160
You know,
that's a good fucking song.

3281
02:10:07,960 --> 02:10:10,210
That era,
people were looking at that like,

3282
02:10:10,211 --> 02:10:12,130
okay,
we have this instead of led Zepplin.

3283
02:10:12,370 --> 02:10:14,260
This is what replaced the doors.
I'm like,

3284
02:10:14,261 --> 02:10:15,430
what the fuck?
And then you get older,

3285
02:10:15,431 --> 02:10:17,370
you realize that you can listen to both.
Kind of what happened to,

3286
02:10:17,410 --> 02:10:19,440
like I was talking about before with me
and he's like,

3287
02:10:19,630 --> 02:10:20,740
when you got into rock,
I was like,

3288
02:10:20,950 --> 02:10:21,783
wait a second.

3289
02:10:22,740 --> 02:10:26,690
Leyland and John Lennon aren't that
fucking far apart.

3290
02:10:27,580 --> 02:10:30,850
They're much closer together than like,
you know what's playing on the radio

3291
02:10:30,851 --> 02:10:32,000
right now.
Yeah.

3292
02:10:32,530 --> 02:10:33,363
Yeah.
That's,

3293
02:10:34,180 --> 02:10:35,690
I mean waylon used to play with buddy
holly.

3294
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:37,490
That's all you got to start.
No Shit.

3295
02:10:37,790 --> 02:10:38,450
Yeah,
he started,

3296
02:10:38,450 --> 02:10:40,580
I mean it's the most famous story of
all,

3297
02:10:40,581 --> 02:10:42,170
but he had,
he's supposed to be on that plane.

3298
02:10:42,500 --> 02:10:46,370
Dwight Yoakam was probably the first guy
that was a real country guy that I was a

3299
02:10:46,371 --> 02:10:47,900
fan of.
I was a fan of Dwight.

3300
02:10:47,901 --> 02:10:50,120
He kinda crossed over a little bit.
You want to happen.

3301
02:10:50,121 --> 02:10:53,000
He's a Kentucky boy as well.
A lot of great music from Kentucky.

3302
02:10:53,001 --> 02:10:54,080
Huh.
But he,

3303
02:10:54,140 --> 02:10:56,510
I always thought of him as the Kentucky
Guy and he is,

3304
02:10:56,511 --> 02:10:59,180
but he actually had to move to la to
make it.

3305
02:10:59,181 --> 02:11:02,420
He had,
he was in the punk scene out here cause

3306
02:11:02,421 --> 02:11:06,050
back then like wearing a dressing like
that,

3307
02:11:06,051 --> 02:11:10,820
wearing the cowboy hat and plan kind of
old style buck owens country was thought

3308
02:11:10,830 --> 02:11:12,170
of as crazy as it.

3309
02:11:12,230 --> 02:11:13,700
I mean,
he wasn't playing,

3310
02:11:14,540 --> 02:11:15,650
you know,
punk music,

3311
02:11:15,651 --> 02:11:19,090
but he was an,
he was kind of an out right outside or

3312
02:11:19,100 --> 02:11:19,860
up,
you know,

3313
02:11:19,860 --> 02:11:22,010
and that was thought of as like a weird
thing to be doing.

3314
02:11:22,130 --> 02:11:26,360
He'd seemed to me that what he was doing
was like an Ode to the classics,

3315
02:11:26,570 --> 02:11:28,670
you know,
it's like he was a [inaudible].

3316
02:11:28,740 --> 02:11:33,140
He also put his own spin on it.
200% a hundred percent but you like it

3317
02:11:33,141 --> 02:11:35,840
reminiscent of like really great country
music of old.

3318
02:11:35,841 --> 02:11:39,540
Like he was obviously a,
he was a huge fan of that music and

3319
02:11:39,541 --> 02:11:40,970
yeah,
I felt like he was one of the first guys

3320
02:11:41,510 --> 02:11:45,940
who
brought that old sound back but kind of

3321
02:11:45,941 --> 02:11:49,220
got some,
you know,

3322
02:11:49,221 --> 02:11:50,330
got air play it,
you know,

3323
02:11:50,390 --> 02:11:54,200
he got a lot of airplay and mainstream
with going back to the old guys.

3324
02:11:54,201 --> 02:11:55,730
Yeah.
Like that ain't that lonely yet.

3325
02:11:55,730 --> 02:11:58,100
Song,
that song play guitars,

3326
02:11:58,101 --> 02:12:00,560
cadillacs and hillbilly music that's
done that.

3327
02:12:00,561 --> 02:12:03,440
It was a huge hit.
That was inspiration to subtract two

3328
02:12:03,441 --> 02:12:05,120
beer.
We'd coutures and Honky tonk music,

3329
02:12:05,150 --> 02:12:06,770
but he was like a God that you were
allowed to.

3330
02:12:06,771 --> 02:12:09,050
Like,
it's like you're allowed to like him as

3331
02:12:09,051 --> 02:12:11,930
a country person.
It made you like the 90,

3332
02:12:11,990 --> 02:12:14,090
like you were talking about.
Shit changes so fast.

3333
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:17,510
Even the fucking like you look back at
mainstream country in the 90s,

3334
02:12:17,511 --> 02:12:21,560
it sounds like fucking raw deal
recordings compared to what we got out

3335
02:12:21,561 --> 02:12:23,870
there right now.
I'd like it's changed so much.

3336
02:12:23,871 --> 02:12:26,240
So fast.
That like next sheet like this,

3337
02:12:26,241 --> 02:12:28,070
the kind of what mainstream Alan
Jackson,

3338
02:12:28,071 --> 02:12:32,420
Randy Travis.
That shit sounds like fucking like down

3339
02:12:32,421 --> 02:12:33,980
in the dirt.
Like it sounds like blue,

3340
02:12:34,010 --> 02:12:35,510
like a gritty.
Yeah,

3341
02:12:35,511 --> 02:12:38,420
it sounds like I'm fucking jug band.
What has happened?

3342
02:12:38,570 --> 02:12:40,670
We've like,
could you imagine if Johnny Cash could

3343
02:12:40,671 --> 02:12:41,510
watch those guys?

3344
02:12:41,510 --> 02:12:44,360
Like throwing their fucking hands,
those hip hop hand signs,

3345
02:12:44,361 --> 02:12:48,680
the perfectly quaffed outfits and then
jeans with rips already and um,

3346
02:12:48,890 --> 02:12:51,770
people always send me these genes.
Repin or did you buy them?

3347
02:12:51,771 --> 02:12:52,640
No,
this is ripped.

3348
02:12:52,700 --> 02:12:53,240
Yeah.
No,

3349
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:54,240
that's real.
Yeah,

3350
02:12:54,380 --> 02:12:58,520
I swear I wasn't going to wear it.
I'm not paid a hundred for that.

3351
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:01,940
Um,
now people send me memes all the time of

3352
02:13:01,941 --> 02:13:03,440
that shit.
That's what it's called.

3353
02:13:03,470 --> 02:13:04,370
So they,
they put like,

3354
02:13:04,371 --> 02:13:06,290
yeah,
they'll help picture of wayland.

3355
02:13:06,530 --> 02:13:08,240
It's a place,
I don't know what it's called.

3356
02:13:08,660 --> 02:13:11,240
It's like I've gotten a hundred of these
but make sure why.

3357
02:13:11,241 --> 02:13:12,620
And I'm like Florida,
Georgia line.

3358
02:13:13,310 --> 02:13:15,920
Yeah.
I think I pissed there at once and I've

3359
02:13:15,921 --> 02:13:18,620
gotten that meme.
I've gotten a hundred of you find that.

3360
02:13:18,621 --> 02:13:21,680
But there's a hundred of those guys like
you know,

3361
02:13:21,740 --> 02:13:23,780
rolling in there.
People love making those cause there's,

3362
02:13:23,810 --> 02:13:25,490
yeah,
there's an audience for that still,

3363
02:13:25,491 --> 02:13:26,000
which is great.

3364
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,490
Well shooter talked about,
he had that song,

3365
02:13:28,491 --> 02:13:31,380
they should outlaw you.
That was specifically about that.

3366
02:13:31,410 --> 02:13:35,850
Like these fake country guys like these
especially fake out log eyes.

3367
02:13:35,870 --> 02:13:38,220
Yeah.
But what his dad had to go through to

3368
02:13:38,221 --> 02:13:42,050
make it in country whose dad was a,
I mean a real pioneer in a,

3369
02:13:42,051 --> 02:13:43,980
a,
a rebel in a lot of ways.

3370
02:13:43,981 --> 02:13:48,360
Like he did whatever the fuck you wanted
to do and it worked and that sound

3371
02:13:48,390 --> 02:13:51,320
became like super popular.
And Wayne Lake Jennings,

3372
02:13:51,860 --> 02:13:54,270
you listen to a loyal and records.
Now the best shit,

3373
02:13:54,600 --> 02:13:55,750
it sounds like it was quarter.
Yes.

3374
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:56,970
It's amazing.
It sounds,

3375
02:13:56,980 --> 02:14:00,030
it has an age to fucking day and sun and
shooters.

3376
02:14:00,031 --> 02:14:02,460
Weird too man,
because he does all kinds of strange

3377
02:14:02,461 --> 02:14:06,690
music album is a coon tosh.
It's like almost electronic and it's

3378
02:14:06,691 --> 02:14:07,860
fucking killer.
It's killer.

3379
02:14:07,940 --> 02:14:10,320
Well he's,
he's another guy that just wherever his

3380
02:14:10,321 --> 02:14:11,460
fucking,
what am I fit back?

3381
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:13,890
One of my favorite guys,
it's got billy Joe Shaver is like Sam,

3382
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:18,070
he's old now and he wrote a lot of this.
There's a way on an album called Honky

3383
02:14:18,071 --> 02:14:18,990
tonk here.
I was at Bailey.

3384
02:14:18,991 --> 02:14:22,140
Joe Shaver wrote every song,
it's my favorite way on record and billy

3385
02:14:22,141 --> 02:14:24,900
joe is still around.
He just put out a new album last year

3386
02:14:24,930 --> 02:14:26,910
and it's fucking great.
And um,

3387
02:14:27,900 --> 02:14:31,230
the first song to duet with Willie
Nelson and it's called hard to be an

3388
02:14:31,231 --> 02:14:34,350
outlaw in the song,
is hard to be an outlaw when you ain't

3389
02:14:34,351 --> 02:14:36,420
want it anymore.
So Tim,

3390
02:14:36,450 --> 02:14:38,010
who was actually part of that law
movement,

3391
02:14:38,011 --> 02:14:39,780
which I'm not,
I'm not part of that,

3392
02:14:39,781 --> 02:14:40,470
you know,
I'm,

3393
02:14:40,470 --> 02:14:41,320
I'm just here,
have,

3394
02:14:41,400 --> 02:14:42,660
you know,
doing what I do.

3395
02:14:42,661 --> 02:14:46,200
What is the outlaw movement?
That was the 70s when they were the

3396
02:14:46,201 --> 02:14:47,280
equivalent of,
you know,

3397
02:14:48,120 --> 02:14:48,953
I don't know.
You know,

3398
02:14:49,020 --> 02:14:51,530
but you're kind of comedy,
you know what I mean?

3399
02:14:51,540 --> 02:14:52,530
It's like,
what do you mean?

3400
02:14:52,531 --> 02:14:54,240
It's not even that funny,
but like people listen,

3401
02:14:54,330 --> 02:14:56,010
I've just,
I'm just singing like I see it,

3402
02:14:56,011 --> 02:14:57,690
you know,
fighting fucking fart.

3403
02:14:57,691 --> 02:14:59,000
So you know,
but it's,

3404
02:14:59,340 --> 02:15:00,390
there's something,
there's,

3405
02:15:00,430 --> 02:15:02,310
it's funny,
it's funny,

3406
02:15:02,730 --> 02:15:03,563
I'm laughing.
Yeah.

3407
02:15:03,570 --> 02:15:04,850
Right.
People are laughing at,

3408
02:15:04,851 --> 02:15:08,340
so I don't get mad when people,
but it is very outlaw and a lot of ways

3409
02:15:08,341 --> 02:15:10,270
by the method of going about putting it
out.

3410
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:15,360
But I'll to defend them,
like you don't want to claim it because

3411
02:15:15,361 --> 02:15:17,670
it's like an iconic name,
like outlaw country,

3412
02:15:17,671 --> 02:15:19,170
like those guys.
But those guys were,

3413
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:21,780
that was when pop,
well that was when country music,

3414
02:15:21,781 --> 02:15:23,780
which by the way,
that country on the radio then sound

3415
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:24,900
like I said,
sounds great now,

3416
02:15:24,901 --> 02:15:26,910
but it was a lot of strings and got
really lush.

3417
02:15:27,510 --> 02:15:30,780
And then people like Waylon Willie moved
out in Nashville,

3418
02:15:30,781 --> 02:15:33,030
moved to Austin,
started smoking weed and said,

3419
02:15:33,031 --> 02:15:34,320
I'm going to do it my fucking way.

3420
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:36,450
And it's,
and that's what kind of,

3421
02:15:36,451 --> 02:15:37,890
you know,
that kind of thing and owns like,

3422
02:15:38,340 --> 02:15:40,230
you know,
get the fucking strings out,

3423
02:15:40,231 --> 02:15:42,420
get all this shit out.
I just want to play Mi,

3424
02:15:42,421 --> 02:15:43,201
guitar,
Bass,

3425
02:15:43,201 --> 02:15:43,651
drums,
you know,

3426
02:15:43,651 --> 02:15:46,500
just back to the basics.
So they were really pushing the

3427
02:15:46,501 --> 02:15:47,400
envelope,
you know,

3428
02:15:47,401 --> 02:15:50,010
way more than anything I've ever
Nashville have any,

3429
02:15:50,011 --> 02:15:52,080
I mean,
how much of Nashville like real music

3430
02:15:52,081 --> 02:15:54,130
and how much of Nashville is like pop,
you know?

3431
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:56,550
Um,
or when you're there,

3432
02:15:56,700 --> 02:16:00,090
it's really,
it's so funny because like I said,

3433
02:16:00,091 --> 02:16:02,820
most of my family's from Nashville,
so I went there all the time growing up

3434
02:16:03,250 --> 02:16:04,890
and it was really almost,
not a ghost town,

3435
02:16:04,891 --> 02:16:07,140
but it was just like,
it was a kind of,

3436
02:16:07,210 --> 02:16:09,930
had a small town feel and you would,
but you would see crystal gayle or

3437
02:16:09,931 --> 02:16:13,740
whoever it was on the streets,
but has known it was senator of country

3438
02:16:13,741 --> 02:16:14,670
music,
but it was,

3439
02:16:15,630 --> 02:16:19,080
it was not
a flashy town.

3440
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:20,790
And now it's the place.
It's,

3441
02:16:20,950 --> 02:16:22,670
it's another Hollywood.
It's what you should go.

3442
02:16:22,950 --> 02:16:24,420
It change.
But it's real recent,

3443
02:16:24,421 --> 02:16:26,490
right?
It's within the last I went,

3444
02:16:27,610 --> 02:16:30,130
there's a,
this the new,

3445
02:16:30,131 --> 02:16:32,560
the silver lake,
which is apparently the hip plays here.

3446
02:16:32,770 --> 02:16:36,820
The silver lake in Nashville is like
call his eachnet East Nashville and I

3447
02:16:36,821 --> 02:16:38,830
don't think,
I didn't even ever been there as a kid.

3448
02:16:38,831 --> 02:16:41,470
I didn't,
I don't think it was just slumps and now

3449
02:16:41,471 --> 02:16:43,120
it's,
you can get a place there.

3450
02:16:43,121 --> 02:16:46,330
It's till fucking expensive.
So it's got gentrified told like how

3451
02:16:46,331 --> 02:16:50,410
many years ago this happened.
If you bought a house there five years

3452
02:16:50,411 --> 02:16:52,090
ago,
you're fucking swimming in it right now.

3453
02:16:52,270 --> 02:16:54,850
Yeah,
because I started going to xannies in

3454
02:16:54,851 --> 02:16:57,550
Nashville's a comedy club.
I started going there.

3455
02:16:57,790 --> 02:17:00,430
I just want to say like maybe 10 years
ago I started going there,

3456
02:17:00,431 --> 02:17:02,330
maybe 10 bet it's weight.
It was way different,

3457
02:17:03,460 --> 02:17:04,300
way different.

3458
02:17:04,300 --> 02:17:07,450
I mean these places now,
like they have those spotlights that

3459
02:17:07,451 --> 02:17:11,800
stream the sky and they'll have like
some fucking grand opening thing or some

3460
02:17:11,801 --> 02:17:15,760
press release thing and you'll see like
these tour buses and Papa razzies and

3461
02:17:15,761 --> 02:17:18,010
like what is going on.
That's another thing too is when I was a

3462
02:17:18,011 --> 02:17:19,250
kid,
you know my,

3463
02:17:20,020 --> 02:17:21,280
I had family who was friends with
country,

3464
02:17:21,290 --> 02:17:22,750
not could they were in the business to
just,

3465
02:17:23,170 --> 02:17:24,760
if you're in town,
that's what a lot of people do.

3466
02:17:24,761 --> 02:17:26,380
You know con ever,
never.

3467
02:17:26,381 --> 02:17:29,110
No punk and Paparazzi.
Now I have people I know people there,

3468
02:17:29,111 --> 02:17:30,630
you know when you bought,
when you,

3469
02:17:30,980 --> 02:17:35,050
you got to like warn people where you're
going and do this and that's why I'm

3470
02:17:35,051 --> 02:17:38,470
hoping it's people like Jason or sturge
we'll kind of turn people start moving

3471
02:17:38,471 --> 02:17:40,120
there for the right fucking,
you know,

3472
02:17:40,121 --> 02:17:41,140
make the right kind of music.

3473
02:17:41,140 --> 02:17:43,450
But still it's gotta be some that are
doing that.

3474
02:17:43,451 --> 02:17:44,410
Right.
There are some,

3475
02:17:44,411 --> 02:17:49,411
but I mean how many of them are these
fucking coughed up bands or the hair

3476
02:17:49,751 --> 02:17:50,680
gel?
Almost all.

3477
02:17:50,681 --> 02:17:52,420
I mean like all chains.
Yeah,

3478
02:17:52,421 --> 02:17:53,670
I mean,
but you hear it.

3479
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:55,960
How many sturgis could hear it come into
your podcast?

3480
02:17:55,961 --> 02:17:57,670
You know,
sturgill is a rare dude.

3481
02:17:57,671 --> 02:18:00,340
He's a rare as a shooter there.
They're rare guys,

3482
02:18:00,420 --> 02:18:01,720
but we're really name it.
There's,

3483
02:18:01,810 --> 02:18:03,520
listen,
there's way more of it than you think.

3484
02:18:03,580 --> 02:18:05,630
But those Jason is bells and Sturgis
falls.

3485
02:18:05,640 --> 02:18:10,450
[inaudible] don't like a guy like that.
When when sturge we'll puts out a CD and

3486
02:18:10,451 --> 02:18:13,770
then people find out about it and people
aspire and then they,

3487
02:18:13,880 --> 02:18:16,240
they want to be like that.
And then it sort of gives birth to more

3488
02:18:16,241 --> 02:18:18,730
people like that or more people who can
express themselves.

3489
02:18:18,940 --> 02:18:21,640
But what it didn't ever,
it's almost like Nirvana.

3490
02:18:21,670 --> 02:18:23,110
You know,
remember when they came out it's like,

3491
02:18:23,111 --> 02:18:25,180
oh fuck,
fuck the old shit.

3492
02:18:25,181 --> 02:18:27,280
It's time for real rock and roll the
tape back.

3493
02:18:27,310 --> 02:18:28,210
Poison.
Yeah,

3494
02:18:28,211 --> 02:18:31,180
exactly.
But all that it ended up doing was

3495
02:18:31,181 --> 02:18:33,550
bringing out a bunch of Shitty Nirvana,
copycats.

3496
02:18:33,580 --> 02:18:34,990
There was a lot of that,
there was a lot of that.

3497
02:18:34,991 --> 02:18:37,540
And there's going to be a lot of
surgical copycats coming out soon and

3498
02:18:37,541 --> 02:18:39,490
they're not going to,
they're going to be doing it because

3499
02:18:39,491 --> 02:18:41,980
they think it's going to sell.
Not because sturgill did it cause he

3500
02:18:41,981 --> 02:18:43,540
want,
he had something on his mind that he

3501
02:18:43,541 --> 02:18:44,374
wanted to sing.
You know,

3502
02:18:44,710 --> 02:18:46,750
it's gonna come out the wrong way.
So well,

3503
02:18:46,870 --> 02:18:49,030
there's,
there's always going to be the guy that

3504
02:18:49,031 --> 02:18:51,600
pretends to be the guy that you love.
Yeah.

3505
02:18:51,820 --> 02:18:52,920
You know,
like there's the gun that was good.

3506
02:18:52,930 --> 02:18:56,010
I want you to sell the records,
so I'm times or the host,

3507
02:18:56,030 --> 02:18:58,560
the TV shows or do movies or,
you know,

3508
02:18:58,590 --> 02:18:59,320
whatever.

3509
02:18:59,320 --> 02:19:00,690
Those are the guys.
Like you let go.

3510
02:19:01,150 --> 02:19:04,120
This guy's sort of inauthentic,
like something's going on.

3511
02:19:04,121 --> 02:19:04,650
But,
but when,

3512
02:19:04,650 --> 02:19:07,060
when someone is authentic though,
you could tell,

3513
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:08,500
right?
Can't you tell like storage is,

3514
02:19:08,501 --> 02:19:10,870
you could fucking tell,
listen to that new a sailors guide to

3515
02:19:10,871 --> 02:19:12,160
Earth.
Come on,

3516
02:19:12,161 --> 02:19:13,660
man.
It's the best record of the year by far

3517
02:19:13,661 --> 02:19:15,340
fucking since that,
with mine,

3518
02:19:15,341 --> 02:19:16,900
right in front of me.
It's sensational.

3519
02:19:16,930 --> 02:19:18,280
It's so good.
Yeah.

3520
02:19:18,281 --> 02:19:18,991
Well it's,
it's,

3521
02:19:18,991 --> 02:19:19,541
it's,
it's,

3522
02:19:19,541 --> 02:19:21,880
it's weird how it all flows together
too.

3523
02:19:21,881 --> 02:19:22,714
It's like,
Ooh,

3524
02:19:23,530 --> 02:19:26,170
that's a magnum opus magnus,
you know,

3525
02:19:26,171 --> 02:19:28,490
no one would go into a studio,
make a record like that,

3526
02:19:28,760 --> 02:19:29,630
hoping,
you know,

3527
02:19:29,631 --> 02:19:32,570
thinking that's going to now sell it.
He did it because he wanted to make,

3528
02:19:32,630 --> 02:19:34,550
and you got to eat.
He's got to have,

3529
02:19:35,180 --> 02:19:40,180
it's very rare that you're gonna have a
big company that sells records that has

3530
02:19:40,311 --> 02:19:42,530
the wherewithal to let it go like that.

3531
02:19:42,530 --> 02:19:44,090
Go just go do whatever you want,
man.

3532
02:19:44,330 --> 02:19:46,670
I think he did it all day.
I think you produced it himself and did

3533
02:19:46,671 --> 02:19:47,830
everything.
I think he did it all themselves.

3534
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:48,561
You know honey,
honey,

3535
02:19:48,561 --> 02:19:49,330
he did.
He did.

3536
02:19:49,330 --> 02:19:50,163
He know.
It's funny,

3537
02:19:50,930 --> 02:19:53,760
my first ever La Gig,
the gut,

3538
02:19:54,320 --> 02:19:58,490
I produced my record,
the band after he produced the banner

3539
02:19:58,491 --> 02:20:01,700
came in right after I left was honey
honey and uh,

3540
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:03,440
they heard my record in the studio and
they're like,

3541
02:20:03,441 --> 02:20:05,840
next time you're in La while you open a
shell.

3542
02:20:05,870 --> 02:20:07,130
And I'm like,
yeah,

3543
02:20:07,131 --> 02:20:09,610
sure.
So I played a few songs with them,

3544
02:20:09,611 --> 02:20:12,020
acoustic,
they came out in costume and backed me

3545
02:20:12,021 --> 02:20:14,720
up for a couple of songs cause they had
the record but it wasn't out yet.

3546
02:20:15,140 --> 02:20:17,760
So that was my,
that was my first la show ever.

3547
02:20:17,761 --> 02:20:18,830
It was a,
wow.

3548
02:20:19,010 --> 02:20:20,240
That's crazy.
Oh yeah,

3549
02:20:20,360 --> 02:20:21,260
that's right.
Your friend.

3550
02:20:21,260 --> 02:20:22,550
You're,
you're real good friends.

3551
02:20:22,920 --> 02:20:24,470
We've done a bunch of shows together.
Oh,

3552
02:20:24,471 --> 02:20:25,071
no way.
Yeah,

3553
02:20:25,071 --> 02:20:25,821
no,
it's funny.

3554
02:20:25,821 --> 02:20:27,560
That was my first fucking la show with
honey,

3555
02:20:27,561 --> 02:20:28,280
honey.
Yeah,

3556
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:30,170
they did new year's with me last year.
Oh,

3557
02:20:30,171 --> 02:20:32,810
no way.
At the wiltern in La.

3558
02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:36,260
How big that is.
That's big.

3559
02:20:36,520 --> 02:20:38,000
Thousand people was crazy.
Yeah,

3560
02:20:38,001 --> 02:20:39,900
it was Joey Diaz.
Honey honey.

3561
02:20:39,901 --> 02:20:42,110
His last album was fucking great.
Ren Dunkin.

3562
02:20:42,140 --> 02:20:43,190
Yeah,
it was awesome.

3563
02:20:43,250 --> 02:20:45,740
They were amazing.
They're really good man.

3564
02:20:45,741 --> 02:20:47,390
And he does it.
What does this,

3565
02:20:48,020 --> 02:20:49,850
that's them.
That's them backing me at honey.

3566
02:20:49,851 --> 02:20:53,630
Honey engaging.
They have a,

3567
02:20:55,190 --> 02:20:56,720
she has a beard on.
Yeah.

3568
02:20:56,721 --> 02:20:58,190
I think that that was,
that was,

3569
02:20:58,360 --> 02:21:01,640
that was a sign of things to come when
people want to dress up in costume,

3570
02:21:01,641 --> 02:21:02,940
when they're backing me,
when they're on station,

3571
02:21:03,620 --> 02:21:05,720
they don't want to be seen.
I think I should've seen that as a,

3572
02:21:06,110 --> 02:21:07,700
as a possible sign that maybe I was
doing.

3573
02:21:07,700 --> 02:21:08,810
It was a little bit out there.
Well,

3574
02:21:08,840 --> 02:21:11,090
what I was going to say about them was
they have this song,

3575
02:21:11,340 --> 02:21:14,790
um,
and I used a part of the song on my,

3576
02:21:14,791 --> 02:21:17,000
um,
the music for it with my comedy central

3577
02:21:17,001 --> 02:21:18,230
special,
the opening music.

3578
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:20,390
That's all from them.
That's how I know her music.

3579
02:21:20,750 --> 02:21:25,750
And it's a song called punk kid and they
can't put it out because they made it,

3580
02:21:26,211 --> 02:21:27,890
they spent all their own money making
it,

3581
02:21:27,891 --> 02:21:31,250
but the record company wanted it.
And so like when the record company

3582
02:21:31,251 --> 02:21:33,800
hired them to do a song or do a,
an album,

3583
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:36,920
they wanted the punk kid song and they
wanted it for free and they're like,

3584
02:21:36,921 --> 02:21:38,480
no,
but we spent all this money on that

3585
02:21:38,481 --> 02:21:39,440
song.
This is our song.

3586
02:21:39,441 --> 02:21:40,820
We wrote it.
You can't own this.

3587
02:21:40,821 --> 02:21:42,820
Like you can't,
you can't gain the song.

3588
02:21:42,830 --> 02:21:44,180
When they tried to and they said no.

3589
02:21:44,180 --> 02:21:46,610
So that song,
it's like it's out in the ether.

3590
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:48,980
So you have to figure out what to do
with that song that's going to hold onto

3591
02:21:48,981 --> 02:21:51,410
it for awhile.
I will say I did learn,

3592
02:21:51,411 --> 02:21:53,240
you know,
being around the music as much in the

3593
02:21:53,241 --> 02:21:55,670
head.
I knew I'd heard all those stories.

3594
02:21:55,700 --> 02:21:57,160
That's crazy.
That's why I bought my mat,

3595
02:21:57,490 --> 02:21:59,060
my master's degree.
You can't do fucking,

3596
02:21:59,090 --> 02:22:00,560
you can't touch this.
They don't.

3597
02:22:00,561 --> 02:22:02,360
You don't need them anymore.
If I'm quoting the hammer,

3598
02:22:02,440 --> 02:22:05,030
you know you don't need them anymore.
I don't like what we're talking about

3599
02:22:05,031 --> 02:22:07,040
about distribution.
You'll get more distribution from doing

3600
02:22:07,041 --> 02:22:09,300
this show or more people here.
We're going to find this.

3601
02:22:09,410 --> 02:22:10,640
See,
guarantee you.

3602
02:22:10,850 --> 02:22:14,900
It's going to be crazy and from doing
mine and do Adam Carolla's and do

3603
02:22:14,901 --> 02:22:18,530
everybody else's corolla played at the
other day.

3604
02:22:18,531 --> 02:22:19,490
Maybe you're too,
we'd all,

3605
02:22:19,500 --> 02:22:20,360
these guys will do it.

3606
02:22:20,690 --> 02:22:22,420
You can get on Joey Diaz.
Joe,

3607
02:22:22,480 --> 02:22:24,470
you'll have yawned Arielle have you on
Dunkin.

3608
02:22:24,471 --> 02:22:27,390
Anybody who was around,
we'll have you on and people hear about

3609
02:22:27,391 --> 02:22:28,680
it.
This is the new,

3610
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:31,710
it's a new time man.
It's a new world and you know they're

3611
02:22:31,711 --> 02:22:33,300
not trying to,
you know it's,

3612
02:22:33,540 --> 02:22:34,780
I'm just happy it came,
you know,

3613
02:22:34,830 --> 02:22:37,020
then I'm here now because like you said
20 years ago,

3614
02:22:37,021 --> 02:22:39,450
this album would not exist.
It would not exist,

3615
02:22:39,480 --> 02:22:42,600
but it exists.
Wheeler Walker redneck shit.

3616
02:22:42,870 --> 02:22:43,651
Go get it.
Yeah.

3617
02:22:43,651 --> 02:22:45,240
I also,
I think it was someone said it was the

3618
02:22:45,241 --> 02:22:49,560
first album to chart on the bill country
billboard charts with a bad word.

3619
02:22:49,710 --> 02:22:53,230
Really nobody,
no country charts it cause ever charged

3620
02:22:53,240 --> 02:22:54,750
with a bad word in the title Redneck
Shit.

3621
02:22:54,920 --> 02:22:58,800
Eat and pussy kicking ass.
That's one of my favorite songs,

3622
02:22:58,801 --> 02:22:59,760
dude.
I'm telling you,

3623
02:22:59,761 --> 02:23:02,940
I'm not gonna lie.
I puts a smile on my face.

3624
02:23:03,870 --> 02:23:06,180
I'll be listening to this at the gym.
By the way,

3625
02:23:06,181 --> 02:23:07,800
there's a download code in that too.
Oh,

3626
02:23:07,801 --> 02:23:09,130
there is?
Oh,

3627
02:23:09,340 --> 02:23:11,130
you guys are the vinyl.
You get a download code.

3628
02:23:11,250 --> 02:23:12,270
Dude,
I want to pay.

3629
02:23:12,300 --> 02:23:14,100
I want to buy it on itunes.
Well,

3630
02:23:14,101 --> 02:23:16,190
this guy,
you want to see it too?

3631
02:23:16,380 --> 02:23:18,940
Yeah.
He's going to fucking make him by giving

3632
02:23:18,970 --> 02:23:20,820
him he's been,
he must it cost nine bucks.

3633
02:23:20,821 --> 02:23:22,410
That's what normal.
That's a normal album.

3634
02:23:22,411 --> 02:23:24,030
Costs right on.
I can use nine bucks.

3635
02:23:24,050 --> 02:23:25,470
That's good.
Whatever the normal.

3636
02:23:25,590 --> 02:23:29,430
I didn't sturge we'll had the number one
song and the number one album last week.

3637
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:31,870
Yeah,
I think his album's a loom and that

3638
02:23:32,220 --> 02:23:34,410
number one,
keep him on until he spent half his time

3639
02:23:34,411 --> 02:23:37,620
fucking taking motherfuckers out.
I don't know if that's true.

3640
02:23:38,310 --> 02:23:40,740
I really don't think he's an assassin.
I think,

3641
02:23:40,741 --> 02:23:42,000
um,
you should go to a doctor.

3642
02:23:42,600 --> 02:23:44,400
I'm telling you.
Look just like Ben Hoffman too.

3643
02:23:44,401 --> 02:23:45,850
It's so weird.
Well,

3644
02:23:46,140 --> 02:23:47,160
I,
like I said,

3645
02:23:47,161 --> 02:23:49,110
someone said,
I look like exact and that I don't,

3646
02:23:49,140 --> 02:23:51,390
that person's an asshole.
That doesn't make any sense at all.

3647
02:23:51,490 --> 02:23:54,540
But I don't want you both handsome,
but that's ridiculous.

3648
02:23:54,541 --> 02:23:56,650
It's just a beard thing I guess.
But,

3649
02:23:56,770 --> 02:23:57,900
well,
I would say someone say you look like

3650
02:23:57,901 --> 02:23:59,940
Zach Galifianakis you have different
color.

3651
02:24:00,150 --> 02:24:02,280
People just saw beard.
People are stupid.

3652
02:24:02,281 --> 02:24:04,140
Right?
People see me doing this shit in there

3653
02:24:04,141 --> 02:24:06,930
just like he can't be real.
So they're like,

3654
02:24:07,110 --> 02:24:08,150
he's got to be somebody.
Oh,

3655
02:24:08,230 --> 02:24:10,020
that's it.
And then also that video of you at the

3656
02:24:10,021 --> 02:24:11,820
fake mustache that hurt things.
Yeah.

3657
02:24:11,821 --> 02:24:14,160
It doesn't help but whatever.
Fucking listen,

3658
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:18,690
they can't take a joke.
Regular Walker Jr com you fucks.

3659
02:24:18,930 --> 02:24:20,400
And uh,
go to itunes.
