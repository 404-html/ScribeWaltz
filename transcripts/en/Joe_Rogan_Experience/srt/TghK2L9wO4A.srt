1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,190
We'll,
I've what's with the funky bag fellow?

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,820
Look at that beautiful hippie case
you got going on there. We've got the,

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,750
the Bandanna Rockin the pygmy has
returned. When did you become the big pig?

4
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:12,360
Me and not a the viking.
Yeah,

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,830
I think that was just something that
kind of naturally changed a couple of a

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,460
weeks ago. Oh, a couple of weeks ago.
Yeah. So uh, you've returned everybody.

7
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:25,350
Justin wren. Um, you were a, you're going
to be fighting for belter now. Yeah.

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,320
It's spelled throw the sucker right
up, right up to you. That absolutely.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,310
It's Bella tore one 41. Uh,
and yeah, it's Friday night.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,900
August 28th he'll be on spike.

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,130
So you talked about doing this when you
were here before and you said it was a

12
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:41,850
good way to raise awareness for
your cause. Fight for the forgotten.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,270
You got the tee shirt on right now.
Is it fight for the forgotten.org?

14
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:46,110
Is that the uh,

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,920
fight for the forgotten.org right now
and a fight for the forgotten.com will be

16
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:51,870
changed in the matter of a day or two.

17
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:57,290
So you decided to make a comeback just
to try to raise awareness and help these

18
00:00:57,631 --> 00:01:01,830
pygmies. That's the number one motivation
for sure. Second would be a man.

19
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:05,910
I love the sport. I love the sport.
Uh, just like you. But uh, yeah,

20
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:09,180
I think that's a great opportunity
to give my family a voice.

21
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,710
And how long has it been since you
fought? It's been five years, bro. Wow.

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,650
Five years. Two months. How
old are you now? I'm 28.

23
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,870
He's still a young and damn good. Still
got at least seven years. Yeah. Oh,

24
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,230
for sure. Especially
heavyweights. Heavyweights. A,

25
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,020
I watched some videos
of you training to man,

26
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:29,500
you're looking good dude for five years
off. That's crazy. Yeah. I guess, uh,

27
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,930
in the forest it wasn't too, too much of
a fatty diet at like here in the states.

28
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,760
Well, it's not just that, I'm like, you
didn't take any beatings. You didn't,

29
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:43,460
you know, no gym wars, you know, a
stress on your joints. All that. The,

30
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,940
I got to heal up a lot on the,
the battle wound kind of things.

31
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,610
I mean I went through a lot of sickness
and stuff. But besides that, like yeah,

32
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,950
fighting wise I healed up
from a lot of injuries.

33
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,490
Imagine if like you have a malaria
actually gives you endurance or something

34
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,780
crazy. That'd be awesome. I
go now and again, you know,

35
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,840
cause they say they like certain things
are actually good for injuries like bee

36
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:08,430
stings, like are good for arthritis. Some
strange went. Yeah. Yeah. Like they uh,

37
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,600
they put beast things on people that
have certain types of arthritis and it

38
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:13,830
actually helps relieve them.

39
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,670
Well imagine if people found out that
I'm like malaria. Cause you were,

40
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:20,970
you were saying you were like basically
yeah, that was about the day for sure.

41
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,460
Um, it would, one thing that's
crazy say insect bites, um,

42
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,480
there's a way that they do sutures or
stitches in the Congo with these crazy

43
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:31,050
ants and a,

44
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,580
they're these army ants or soldier ants
that literally the pierce your skin.

45
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:38,220
And so they'll just take
it and let it bite a wound.

46
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,570
Cause then they pull the body off and so
they leave the head leave the mandibles

47
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:46,660
or the jaw that literally close your
wound that way I've been bit by Amanda.

48
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,720
They're terrible.
That's fucking crazy.

49
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,890
So you just walk around with a bunch
of heads on a cut. Right? Absolutely.

50
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:57,750
It does work. It works. It works
for sure. Yeah. It's like a staple.

51
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,250
Yeah. It'd be just like getting
staples, I guess necessity.

52
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,730
The mother of invention, uh, I don't know
if you know this, but this is a crazy,

53
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:04,690
a malaria fact.

54
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:09,550
He could throw around malaria has killed
half of the people that have ever died

55
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,800
ever in the world. Wow.
That's crazy. That's nuts.

56
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,700
Had no idea. Um, but
I believe it cause uh,

57
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,100
absolutely believe it cause
it's terrible. It's um, I,

58
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,730
I've known people that will get
ahead of it. Be that picture. Yeah.

59
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:29,620
There you go bro. Fuck, I
told us that is nuts. Wow.

60
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:31,240
Those guys have some really long,

61
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:36,160
we're looking at a photo of the army
ants being used to suture or wound.

62
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,720
And those, those ones have these
crazy long and slender ones,

63
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:45,400
but the ones in Congo, they
have these thick just nuts.
So yeah, look right there.

64
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,570
We'll do that one up top.
That's crazy. That one might be,

65
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,700
is that fair shot?
That looks fake as fuck.

66
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,970
But that's just stitches. Yeah,
that's a well necessity, right?

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,400
I mean you got to figure out
a way to close things up.

68
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,730
There's no crazy glue in the
Congo, right? No, no. Uh, they,

69
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,480
they use other kinds of stuff that's
real sticky SAP to kind of, uh,

70
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,820
men things together. Um, from trees.

71
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:12,910
They also use vines to tie up a
bunch of stuff like soccer balls.

72
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,750
They'll use the tee shirt, old tee shirt
or rag, and then they just use, uh,

73
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,980
these vines in time so tightly.
It's becomes a perfectly round ball,

74
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,400
not perfectly round, but round
enough to kick around. Well,

75
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:27,640
that's one of the things about soccer
that people find appealing is that it's

76
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:31,200
not that hard to create a ball. And all
you need is just flat ground. Right.

77
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,480
Know it's why it's such a good sport
for people that don't have money. Yeah.

78
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:35,980
They even play with half,

79
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,490
half a flattened balls that,

80
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:42,190
that the kicker around cause
they still use it. So yeah,

81
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:45,580
everybody's using the same ball.
I guess it's not as good,

82
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,900
but they get beaten up and popped and
everything cause he sold it really cheap

83
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,150
soccer balls anyways. They're only
going to last a couple of weeks.

84
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:53,980
But now when you say the Congo,

85
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,480
the Congo itself is really huge.
Right?

86
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,280
I mean I think if I'm not mistaken,

87
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:03,610
I think it's as wide as the
United States of America.

88
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,720
I think it might be like three quarters
of the continental United States,

89
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,660
something like that. It's the 10th
largest country in the world, I believe.

90
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,400
And so it's, it's massive. It's only
got about 74 million people. Um,

91
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,640
but I think 85% of those
people or maybe 80,

92
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:22,660
85% live on less than a dollar
a day. Um, it's a, yeah,

93
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:26,770
it's the flip flops between the poorest
country in the world and second poorest.

94
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:31,660
But it is the most underdeveloped
country. So Lisa, amount of roads,

95
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:34,900
clean water, uh, education, uh, medical,

96
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,930
like it's just the most underdeveloped.
Like when I go to Uganda,

97
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,940
I kind of get the feeling of whenever
I come back from Africa to the United

98
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,360
States and how it's just like, wow, this
is really developed compared to there.

99
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,520
When I go from Congo to
Uganda, I feel like, wow,

100
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,040
you gone has really developed and got
Three d movies, a yogurt land. Um,

101
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,320
they have a KFC actually I have
like four or five KFC KFCS now. Wow.

102
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,290
But they're racist north

103
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,330
and then they have a thing that gets
there. KFC. Yeah. But there it's a,

104
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,810
what's next? Watermelons.
Assholes. They are, they,

105
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,180
they have, what is it? Oh,
it's kind of fine dining at,

106
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,220
they have a weeder Breely stuff.
Yeah. It's real nice. It's a,

107
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,150
you got a charging station for your,
your smartphone and you to really, yeah.

108
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,420
Wow.
Kfcs Pretty God damn delicious.

109
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:26,450
I know it's supposedly not good for
you, but I'll tell you what, man,

110
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,190
I indulge and KFC,

111
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:32,630
every couple of months I'll buy some KFC
and I wait till I either eat it or I'll

112
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:34,940
wait till it gets cold and
I eat it with hot sauce.

113
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,070
KFC with some Habanero hot sauce,

114
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:40,820
get some LEU Kotecha to real Mexican
shit that you got to go to those funky

115
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:45,080
grocery stores to buy or online
some good stuff. Oh Dude,

116
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,190
it's just not good for you.

117
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,510
Apparently we were talking
about how they're putting
a sucralose and Diet Pepsi.

118
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,240
Do you need to figure out a way to make
Kentucky Fried checking? Good for you?

119
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,800
Yeah, that'd be great. That's, that's,

120
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:57,260
that's the worst thing about all
the tasty food is it's bad for you.

121
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,780
Exactly the opposite.
Fuck man.

122
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,070
What's up with that first world problems
like literally if anybody could talk

123
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:05,660
about first world problems,
it's you.

124
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:11,020
I mean a guy who goes from being a reality
star on the ultimate fighter fighting

125
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:15,580
in the UFC and then all of a sudden
you're living in the Congo. For,

126
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,600
for folks who don't know Justin's story,

127
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,250
Justin's been on the podcast a couple of
times and the story is, it's compelling.

128
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:24,680
It's crazy, it's heartwarming. It's just,

129
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:27,830
it's an amazing tale of a guy,

130
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:33,140
you who goes to the Congo and falls in
love with these people that don't have a

131
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:36,890
voice and, and, and you've
done incredible things.

132
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,400
And because of the money that was raised,
because your shows on here,

133
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:42,780
there's the fight for the
forgotten website a year.

134
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:47,420
How many wells have you created
now? Oh, we just celebrated, uh,

135
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,970
as of yesterday, our 25th
waterwall. So 25. Yeah. And,

136
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,950
and what's so great about
that to me is we were,

137
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:58,640
I was there for the first 13
water wells and now we've built,

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,470
so what I love and that website that was
up was we're partnered with water for

139
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,560
now it's water, ford.org
the number four. But, um,

140
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,670
it's kind of like we
set up an exit strategy,

141
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,820
not if this is a lifelong goal for me
and I'll be going back wholeheartedly

142
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,710
everything else.
But we,

143
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,410
our goal is to empower the locals
to be able to do it themselves.

144
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,840
And so I was there for the
first 13 water wells, add, um,

145
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,340
people from the director of implementation
of water for coming in and teaching

146
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,250
our guys hydrology,
geology,

147
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,100
all the different ins and outs of how
to drill a well and protect it. And um,

148
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,230
all the sanitation,

149
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,090
but we're investing in the local so
that they can be the answer to their own

150
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:42,830
problem, if that makes sense in that way.
Um, now we have 17 full time employees.

151
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:47,210
Wow. Yeah. And uh, we have two well
drilling teams, there's 14 guys on that.

152
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:49,010
And then when they go
out into the community,

153
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:53,510
we invite the community into the project.
We want them to feel a part of it.

154
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,220
Um,
there's a lot of organizations

155
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,900
out there and I'm not trying
to talk bad about them,

156
00:08:57,901 --> 00:09:02,901
but they'll go in with $1 million
drilling rig and westerners that are,

157
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,370
you know, water engineers
and that's great. Um,

158
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,020
but they'll go into a community and
kind of say, you know, get back, uh,

159
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:13,640
we're here to do this for you because
you can't do it for yourself. Um,

160
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,280
and then the parts are so expensive,
they're not going to be able to repair it.

161
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:20,160
And when it breaks and
there's a good chance,

162
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:23,280
like I think two and three
of those expensive ones,

163
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,180
or at least no one third of them don't
operate after a year of drilling it.

164
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,060
And so what we want to do is go in there,

165
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,160
teach the locals how to do it themselves,

166
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,840
create a local economy for it and like
stimulate that, give people jobs. Um,

167
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:38,940
and then, and then let the
community fill a part of it.

168
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,720
So we look for day laborers in the
communities we go to and give them a job

169
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:45,900
while we're there and vitamin on the
process, teach them some of that. We've,

170
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,270
we've acquired some of those
guys that are just big,

171
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:52,110
strong love helping people now
they're part of our team. Um,

172
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:56,850
but the core of our team graduated
from university in degrees of community

173
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:58,740
development.
So that's what we want to do.

174
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:03,390
We want to go in there and
power the locals and yeah,
I'm a, I'm a big part of it.

175
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,690
And, but what I want to do is be
able to fan the flames and say,

176
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:11,810
you can do it because a
lot of international aid
tells the locals that they

177
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:15,900
can't do it for themselves. Um,
maybe, maybe they don't say that,

178
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,860
but it's kind of the way they go about
attacking the problem and you got to go

179
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:20,850
about it in a way that,

180
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:26,630
that kind of creates dignity for the
locals instead of kind of robs them of

181
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:29,610
dignity where they feel like
they can't help themselves.

182
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,760
That's a great way of approaching it. I'm
really, I'm so happy you're doing that.

183
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:33,923
I love that.

184
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,160
I love that you're trying to help these
people become a part of this solution,

185
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,910
you know, instead of like someone's
solving it for them. Now when you, um,

186
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,870
when you're involved in digging these
wells and you're saying these expensive,

187
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:50,760
uh, wells break or the machines, like
the pumps, how many parts are involved?

188
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:55,070
Is it like this is like a lot of stuff
as a different ways to do it. It's a lot.

189
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,610
It depends on how deep it is. Yeah. There,

190
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:58,890
there are multiple ways
of drilling a well.

191
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,230
The way we go about it is I
would say more simple but harder,

192
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,150
a lot harder, labor intensive. Um,

193
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:12,610
but it's house just to safe. Um,
well we for instance like the,

194
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:13,830
the deep wells,

195
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:18,570
those are great and honestly like in a
place like Ethiopia or places where it's

196
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:21,840
a, the water tables are super
deep. You're going to need those.

197
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,740
So those are absolutely part of the
solution. We need those water engineers.

198
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:28,980
We need those people doing that.
But whenever, say in the Congo,

199
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,640
it's a place that is a dangerous,
there's lots of rebel groups. Um,

200
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,640
lots of instability.
Uh,

201
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:40,500
they're not going to drive a million
dollar or half a million dollar drilling

202
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:45,330
rig deep into the forest over these
bridges that are notorious for collapsing

203
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:48,990
and taken and washing away.
A big lorries are 18 wheelers,

204
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,970
so they're not going to
drive them across there.

205
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:54,160
They can't get on the roads that we go
on because they're heavy, they're dense.

206
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,130
The parts break on the travel
just out to the villages.

207
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,640
And then once you get there, like going
into the pygmy villages where we are,

208
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,020
sometimes it takes,

209
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,190
it's taken up to two days I think to get
our equipment into the village after we

210
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:10,570
traveled there because we have to hike
it all in and we can hike an hour off the

211
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:12,160
nearest road to the village.

212
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,030
We can hike three hours from
the nearest road to the village.

213
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,900
And so we're hiking in over a ton of, so
when I'm saying this is hard, like our,

214
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:21,790
our guys are,

215
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:26,830
I think they're just as much fighters are
more than I am because they're written

216
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:30,430
down, they're hauling this
stuff in. Um, from the augers,

217
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:35,580
the way we do it is we use a tripod and
we use augers and ropes and pulleys and,

218
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,780
um, and we use these chisels that
go down and they're single pronged,

219
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,633
triple pronged.

220
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,580
And so we have all these tools we can
use for each obstacle that we're going to

221
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:50,050
hit as we go down in different geological
layers. This is incredible. So you're,

222
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:52,720
you're walking three hours
with a ton of equipment,

223
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:58,590
like a anywhere from gravel to bags of
cement that are a hundred pounds to the

224
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:02,800
rock breaker that can be 40 pounds and
other one that's 80 pounds and another

225
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:05,710
one that's like 130 pounds.
She's Christ. Uh, yeah.

226
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:10,420
And we're taking in all the PVC pipes
and a, the galvanized pipes and uh, uh,

227
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:11,930
yeah,
everything that a,

228
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,950
you can think of sand bricks and
we have to hike all that in from,

229
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,010
from the road side,
um,

230
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,170
to the village so it can take two days
of going back and forth to the truck if

231
00:13:23,171 --> 00:13:25,230
we're walking that long
with all the supplies,

232
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:30,590
two to three days of just walking
with giant augers and steel pipes and

233
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:34,230
sandbags. And normally
it's like a day we, we,

234
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,190
we get there and we take all our stuff.
But yeah,

235
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:39,090
it's taken a long time
before because, uh, yeah,

236
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,770
it's a fight to even get there to start
the work. And then once we dig, man,

237
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,870
that's the biggest fight.
Yeah.

238
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:46,570
You must be exhausted by the time
you even get there. Absolutely.

239
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:48,940
Hiking with all this weight. Yeah. Wow.

240
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,990
And then in the ones we start
drilling our average well, um,

241
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,160
in other parts of the world where
the obstacles aren't as as big, um,

242
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,820
they can bust out a well in a
week, 10 days. But where we are,

243
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:03,400
we average 10 to 16 days per water.
Well,

244
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,250
and so our guys are out there and
living with the pygmies, that's,

245
00:14:06,251 --> 00:14:10,830
that's something that we selected
every member of our team, um,

246
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,580
based on can they survive in the
forest? And more than that, can they,

247
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:16,960
can they love,
um,

248
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,650
my pygmy family because that's important
because other people around there,

249
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,250
a lot of them don't love them,
hate them or discriminate.

250
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:26,860
And so we want to find people that
are passionate about the people,

251
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,760
passionate about the water crisis
and then that way, um, yeah,

252
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:35,170
we can then teach them and put the
tools in their hands and invest in them.

253
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,530
And so that's what the last
four years has been for me.

254
00:14:38,531 --> 00:14:42,670
Really investing in good people,
people that believe in it.

255
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,340
And then from there we can
a fanned the flames form.

256
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,480
Is it perplexing for you to have
discovered this place and you know,

257
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:53,930
to being alive in the 21st century with
all the modern communication and all

258
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:55,130
that and to,

259
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,970
to know that these people are out there
and no one has tried to do this before

260
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,340
and that you're,

261
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:04,070
you're stumbling across these giant
groups of people that don't have anyone

262
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:08,390
looking out for them. Is
that, yeah, it's nuts. I mean,

263
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:13,100
I would say that I'm not the only
guy that's ever tried to help him,

264
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,740
but I would say that,
um,

265
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,350
maybe we're trying to take an approach
and that's what's so awesome about the

266
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:19,610
university that I'm partnered with.

267
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,570
They've been working with the
pygmies for years and years. Um,

268
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,730
the guy that's leading the way, the dean
of the school committee development,

269
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,120
he's been doing it since
the year I was born. Um,

270
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,060
and then he started with the university
there for the last 10 years. Um,

271
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,550
so I went to them to say like,
hey,

272
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,930
how can we do this in a strategic way
that the impact will last that will keep

273
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:42,980
going on and on and on
instead of a, uh, a lot of,

274
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,040
I don't know if it's American culture or
what, but it's so fast, you know, and, uh,

275
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,840
we want the quick fix, the quick fix a
lot of times isn't the best route. Um,

276
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:55,730
that the, the results can just be
a temporary one where we have a,

277
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,560
I call it the show up, blow up and
blow out technique. We show up,

278
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,430
we do the show, we take the pictures and
then we leave and we never come back.

279
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,080
And so what we want to do is be opposite.
We want to build relationships,

280
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:13,490
get in touch. We want to be like a family
with them and then show them that, hey,

281
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:16,320
we're not just here for, for land. Um,

282
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:19,460
it because that's what we started
with first. We got them 2000,

283
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:24,140
470 acres of land that's 10
square kilometers in the forest.

284
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,020
Then we did the water and
now we're doing forgot them.

285
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:30,590
Meaning you purchased it for them
or how to purchase for them. Right.

286
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:35,360
We petitioned, lobbied,
uh, and basically said,

287
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:39,200
um, that we went to battle
scene. I mean a peaceful way,

288
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:43,130
but said these people are the first
people of Congo. Not just that.

289
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:44,900
A lot of people say that
the first people of Africa,

290
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,650
they're one of the oldest people groups
are so peaceful there. So if that's true,

291
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:51,740
then they're like,
that's the origins of humanity.

292
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:56,080
And I was just reading as Bill Nye thing
about, um, about humans. It was just, uh,

293
00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:00,140
it was some quote that he had said
about the human race and then like,

294
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,520
it's been proven now that we are literally
all one race and the only thing is

295
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,393
degrading.

296
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,640
Our exposure to ultraviolet light and
different environments have changed the

297
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:11,930
way we look and how our bodies react to
the environment. But if that's the case,

298
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,790
I didn't know that.
But I love that stat and her fact,

299
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,820
well we know that all people, as
far as we know today, you know,

300
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,430
the knowledge kind of grows
and changes over the years.

301
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:23,810
But we know today that all human beings,
as far as we know, came from Africa.

302
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:24,980
So if that's the case,

303
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,060
these people you're dealing with could
very well be the oldest humans in the

304
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:32,480
world. And it kind of makes sense if you
really think about it, you know, I mean,

305
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:37,390
that's where the primates evolved and
came down from the trees and started

306
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:42,391
experimenting and moving along and trying
different environments and spreading

307
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:46,070
out throughout the land. It's
pretty nuts. Yeah. You're like,

308
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,580
get the cradle of life. It's
really a bizarre place. Yeah. Why?

309
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,740
All I know is man, it's the
culture. Their, their, their hearts.

310
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,060
They're such sweet people and I
don't use that word a whole lot,

311
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:03,450
but they're just, they're
sweet as can be. And um,

312
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,870
and so whenever we went
in, um, with, with my team,

313
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,520
basically it was like local lead. Um, I
mean I was, I was in the, in the picture,

314
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,190
but kind of playing behind the scenes
when it came to the negotiating. Um,

315
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,320
and they went in there and it was
the dean of the School of community

316
00:18:18,321 --> 00:18:19,980
development.
It was my guy that's a,

317
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,950
the director of fight for
the forgotten and Congo.

318
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,070
And they said these are
the first people of Congo.

319
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,680
Why is it that they have
zero land of their own?

320
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:32,160
Because shouldn't they have some
land to call their own? And,

321
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:36,000
and we know that looking through
history and whether it was,

322
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,430
whether it was you or whether
it was your grandfather,

323
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,470
we stole this land from him.
We stole it.

324
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,860
They have none of their own and don't
they have a right to have some land.

325
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,010
And so that's kind of where, um, yeah,

326
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:48,990
we just lobbied on their
behalf and then said,

327
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,780
so if I bought the land in
fight for the forgotten,

328
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,400
if we would've bought it in our name,

329
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,550
we would have gotten a five
year certificate and we
would've had to renew things

330
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:58,350
and fees and everything every five years.

331
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,080
If we bought it in the name of the
university there that we partner with,

332
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,520
it would have been a 25 year certificate,
but then at the end of the 25 years,

333
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:09,960
we'd have to pay the same price that we
purchased it for 25 years earlier would

334
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:14,010
have been hundreds of thousands of dollars
every 25 years, maybe more. And um,

335
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,220
then we were thinking it's Kinda cool.
Um,

336
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,390
so in Africa I would say
a lot of the countries,

337
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:25,140
at least my understanding
is that, uh, it was,

338
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,370
it was the colonialist or colonist or
however you say that they were the ones

339
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:33,540
that set up the boundaries of the
countries. It wasn't the tribes.

340
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,540
And so like say Rwanda,
the Hutu and Tutsi,

341
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,750
they probably wouldn't have put their
country together right there because

342
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,930
they've had a long history
of disputes with each other.

343
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,490
So they wouldn't be in the same country.

344
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,310
They would have been to different
countries. Same thing in Congo,

345
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:51,810
there's over 200 tribes. So, um,
and Congo, what, what's very,

346
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,520
I dunno here where all America, America
pride and, or Texas and things like that.

347
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:58,590
But in Congo it's about
what tribe you're from.

348
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,430
And so in a lot of parts of Africa,
they're really proud about their tribe.

349
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,440
And so on the government level,

350
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,030
the strongest thing in court was buying
the land in the name of a tribe because

351
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:11,160
that's what they respect,
that's what they value.

352
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,400
And yet nobody was petition petitioning
and lobbying on behalf of the big nice.

353
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,880
So that's what we wanted to do.

354
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,070
We wanted to go in and say
these people deserve some land.

355
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,280
And we did was buy it from the people
that originally stole it from him,

356
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,110
whether it was dumb or their grandfather.

357
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,790
And so that benefited the people that were
basically oppressing them financially.

358
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:35,010
And we gave him years and years
worth of salary, um, to work with us.

359
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,170
And then on both sides we said,
um,

360
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,530
so they benefited financially
and the pygmies benefited
by having their own land.

361
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,830
You can't give them a water well without
them owning the land that they're on.

362
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,180
And so then we said, how can we give you
both water? That's what the next step is.

363
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:52,000
And the next step after that is food.
How can we start a farming project,

364
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:56,830
teach the pygmies how to farm correctly
or farm really for the first time. Um,

365
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,360
a lot of them worked for their former
masters and stuff like that, but then, um,

366
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,200
with the Mokpala, which means
non-Pygmies, um, we're like,

367
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:07,270
how can we teach you
better farming practices?

368
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:09,370
How can we need to
plant your seeds deeper?

369
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:14,380
You need to put your seeds farther apart
because they're not producing fruit

370
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:14,811
because,

371
00:21:14,811 --> 00:21:19,360
or the corn is only half of the cob
instead of a full cob because your plants

372
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,710
are basically choking themselves out.

373
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,470
So we have three agriculturalist
were interning right now.

374
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,480
They've already done a great job,

375
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,720
but we're wanting to expand and
from three villages to 10 villages,

376
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,170
it's just an immense
sacrifice that you've,

377
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,070
you've done that you've taken on and it's,

378
00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:40,330
it's probably quite difficult to find
people that have the same kind of passion

379
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:42,700
for it that you have. Does it, does he,

380
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:47,320
do you find that to be the case or your
passion has got to be infectious? I mean,

381
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:51,970
a lot of people I'm sure are,
uh, like I have been moved by it,

382
00:21:51,971 --> 00:21:55,150
so thank you. But it's gotta be hard to
get people to go to the Congo though,

383
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:58,540
Dude. Yeah. Well that's, that's, that's
the reason we invest in the locals.

384
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,020
They're there, they're there in
Congo and they, they want, I mean,

385
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:06,200
the people we selected to solve
the water crisis, I mean they,

386
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,470
they know what it's like
to go without clean water.

387
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,450
So they can be the answer to that.

388
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:13,510
They're going to be the ones even more
passionate about it than me. Also,

389
00:22:13,511 --> 00:22:16,310
it's the old adage, teach
a man to fish, right.

390
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,560
And you know a fish for like give a man
a fish and he's just one fish. That's it.

391
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,840
If you're teaching these people. Now
what? W W we got back to the, uh,

392
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,540
we got off the subject of the wells,
like, yes, the tripod and the Auger.

393
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:33,850
So what kind of a machine is
involved in digging this thing?

394
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:38,130
Yeah, it's, it's been developed by
water four and they're awesome. Uh,

395
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,360
an actual machine that,

396
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,100
that is small enough that we
can carry it into the villages.

397
00:22:42,101 --> 00:22:45,470
How much does it weigh
that, uh, don't, don't know.

398
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,080
Maybe I shouldn't quote myself on
this, but I think it's around 150, 150,

399
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:54,140
200. So you guys have so carry that
peak hours. You could, uh, some,

400
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,300
some of the land is only like a 30
minute hike off the nearest quote unquote

401
00:22:58,301 --> 00:23:02,830
road. That's just dirt and clay
and silt and big boulders. Uh,

402
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,420
but uh, yeah, most of them are 30
minutes an hour, two hours. One,

403
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,090
one's even three hours off
the nearest road. So yeah,

404
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:11,860
we got to hike that stuff all in.
Wow.

405
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,890
But I would say that the
manual drilling method,

406
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:18,650
which has been approved by
UNICEF and USAID and, um,

407
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,470
all these other major organizations that
say it can, it can be just as clean,

408
00:23:23,471 --> 00:23:25,240
just as safe as the deep water wells,

409
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:29,500
as long as we do it to a high standard
and keep a high integrity when we do it.

410
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:34,000
Um, which means we backfill
it with a clay sanitary seal.

411
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:39,001
We'd put a cement plug on there so that
way there's no sort of a bacteria or

412
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,690
anything else I can get down into our,
well, we got to protect the water table.

413
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,440
And so we do that every single time
to a high standard. Um, but yeah,

414
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:52,850
so whenever we're doing it, the machine
is us, the manual drilling method,

415
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:54,410
we have wrenches and those augers.

416
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,550
And so those augers would look like kind
of like a full gallon ice auger. Uh,

417
00:23:58,551 --> 00:24:01,250
yeah, very similar. It would be, um,

418
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,950
almost like a coffee can with
two claws on the bottom of it.

419
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,450
And at the top it's got a, uh, a stem
that attaches to a drilling stem.

420
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,050
And then at the top, I mean, whenever
you're starting from the first, uh,

421
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,010
down the first two or three feet,
like you can see the Auger and you just,

422
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,160
it was totally by, it's
almost like toasting. Yeah.

423
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:22,430
You just twist almost like a pump
for the forum. Oh yeah, man. Dude,

424
00:24:22,431 --> 00:24:23,500
my forearms and my bike.

425
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,780
Well my right bicep over here and
my left tricep over here from it.

426
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,090
You got to switch it up dude.
I know we need to,

427
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,050
we need to have the augers changing, but
as of now it's just the same way. Um,

428
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,890
but yeah, so it's, it's us
just drilling and we can go,

429
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:41,850
we can go up to 150 feet
deep in the ground. And so
when we're doing that, it's,

430
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,960
it's crazy. Brewed. I think the
deepest we've gotten is like 70.

431
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,850
So when you're doing 70 feet,
what kind of ups the high 70 is,

432
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:53,090
do you have to keep attaching a longer
and longer pipe? Six foot, uh, or sorry,

433
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:57,650
six meter, 20 foot long segments, segments
of, of this drilling stem. That's a,

434
00:24:57,651 --> 00:25:02,190
it's a square tube that's really
thick, really strong, really heavy. Um,

435
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:05,380
and then we just, we attach that at
the bottom. We have a rope that's,

436
00:25:05,381 --> 00:25:09,650
that's secured to it so we can crank it
up. Um, so we crank it up on the way up.

437
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,480
Um, but, but we, we drill down.
So you're doing it all by hand.

438
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,010
You get to a certain depth rather,

439
00:25:16,011 --> 00:25:19,550
and then you put another segment on and
then you start out, start from scratch.

440
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,640
Right. We attached the segments
the deeper we go. So once we're uh,

441
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,641
20 feet deep,

442
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:28,490
we got to attach another drilling
stem and the ones who were 40 foot,

443
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:31,280
we have to drilling stems once we're
60 foot, we have three drilling stones.

444
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,600
And how do you know where to drill?

445
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,940
Do you have one of those dudes
with one of them? Wishbones yeah.

446
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,850
Walking around to actually no, no. I was
wondering if that defining stuff is real.

447
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,450
I have, I have no clue. I hear, I
hear some people say it's legit,

448
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:48,130
but I haven't ever seen an action.
Hate that expression. Yeah, I hear Ya.

449
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,490
I hear Ya know, I have no clue.
To be honest to the validity.

450
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,550
I still know how it could possibly
really work. I have a friend who, uh,

451
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:58,250
had a well dug out here.
They hired,

452
00:25:58,251 --> 00:26:02,450
this guy said to come over and they had
the two sticks and they just standing

453
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:06,050
there and like he's telling them where to
dig. That's not how we go about it. We,

454
00:26:06,051 --> 00:26:09,920
we,
we have a B s machine,

455
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,420
which is basically,
um,

456
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:16,190
we hook up a car battery and some of
these other like electronic devices and

457
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,280
throw it in the ground. And
um, and then it kind of,

458
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,350
you have a laptop out there and, and
it shows us all this on a graph. Um,

459
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,660
but the way I did it
for the first 13 wells,

460
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,490
now our team's been
trained in that as well.

461
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:31,940
So that's what's so cool about us
partnering with water four is they're

462
00:26:31,941 --> 00:26:35,600
continually training our guys
on the better drilling methods.

463
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:38,180
But whenever I was out there,
hey, we're in the rain forest,

464
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:43,350
there's got to be water, you
know, underneath our feet.
So let's, let's dig. And,

465
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:43,950
uh,

466
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,910
it was real tough the first time cause
we had eight failures over and over and

467
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:52,770
over because we were hitting sand stone.
Now with the V s machine,

468
00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:57,360
we can see if it's sandstone, if
it's courts, if it's granted what,

469
00:26:57,361 --> 00:26:59,880
what kind of rock is underneath
where the water table is.

470
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:02,370
We know how deep we need to drill.
Um,

471
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:07,650
but at first for the first 13 wells, we
were just trial and error. We dig. And if,

472
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:08,070
uh,

473
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:13,050
we even had one spot where we drilled
for 10 or 12 days and we hit water,

474
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,930
but then all of a sudden we hit
a layer of courts underneath it.

475
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,940
And so there was just about,
uh,

476
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:22,440
six feet of clean water on top of this,
uh,

477
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,320
courts. I was deep, but
we needed, we needed more.

478
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:29,580
We needed to break through that courts
and then be able to have hopefully what

479
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:33,100
would, what would be right
underneath that is a rushing, uh,

480
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,950
awesome aquifer for us to tap into that
would make that well sustainable a lot

481
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:40,740
longer. Um, but we couldn't
break through it at that time.

482
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:43,770
We just didn't have the right
tools. Now we do, but um,

483
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,100
but we just had to pick up and move.
So we picked up,

484
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:51,510
moved to maybe a football field away and
we went down the hill a little bit and

485
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:54,570
said, hopefully we don't hit
the courts a layer and yeah,

486
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:58,560
just a football field away. The geology
was different. Um, the, the water,

487
00:27:58,561 --> 00:28:02,990
the recharge rate was great. Uh, the
water kept coming into our well. Um,

488
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,160
and then we have to do a
lot of different things.

489
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:09,350
Like we have to plunge and
bail and, uh, develop, uh,

490
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:13,780
the welds where it'll be clean. Uh,
we put a gravel pack around it. Um,

491
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,980
all this different stuff to make sure
the gravel pack acts as a filters and how

492
00:28:16,981 --> 00:28:21,600
it works. I kind of in what it does is
it keeps, um, so we, we put down a PVC,

493
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,460
uh, like four inch, um, uh,

494
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,840
sorry. It's, it's um,

495
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,540
but w we put the pipe down there and
the gravel pack goes around it and the

496
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:37,510
gravel pack kind of keeps
any dirt, silt, sand, um,

497
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,850
depending on what layer we were in.
It keeps that from coming into our wells.

498
00:28:41,851 --> 00:28:45,810
So that way the water that is inside
of our, of our casing, there we go.

499
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:50,220
Our four inch casing pipe, uh, that, that
allows, it has like little slits in it.

500
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:52,800
Maybe it would be like the size of a,
um,

501
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,020
a saw if you just kind of put us on there.

502
00:28:55,021 --> 00:28:59,490
And it's every like centimeter apart
from each other and that we inside of our

503
00:28:59,491 --> 00:29:04,050
casing and before the water touches
our pipe, like it's crystal clear,

504
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,820
it's clean. We tested all that stuff.
And so the gravel pack keeps the sand,

505
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:13,610
the dirt, the silt, anything
out of our well. Wow. Yeah.

506
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:17,210
That's incredible, man. It's
just incredible the amount of,

507
00:29:17,211 --> 00:29:22,211
of thinking and planning and all that
it's involved in just getting people what

508
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:26,520
everybody here is just totally
takes for granted water. Yeah.

509
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:31,970
It's taken us a month in one spot a month
because we had a failed well and man,

510
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,420
it's brutal. And sometimes, uh, uh, man,

511
00:29:36,421 --> 00:29:40,620
I'm thankful that I was a fighter because
sometimes you have to bite down on

512
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:42,910
your mouthpiece, just keep swinging. Um,

513
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,720
whenever you want to give up and you
have a team out there that's tired. Um,

514
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:49,750
so in between the failed well and
the other one we took two days off,

515
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,860
but we can't go back to,
we call it Bunia, um,

516
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:57,700
the town where we can kind of rest and
get some good food and come back out.

517
00:29:57,701 --> 00:30:01,540
What we did was go to a little market and
get more dried fish and some more rice.

518
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:05,890
It's more beans. And we're
like, hey, we're out here.
We're not stopping until he,

519
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,020
until we finished two.
We get these people clean water.

520
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,880
And when you look at what
they're drinking wheat,

521
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:14,260
we do the water walks with them.
I love telling my team like,

522
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:18,580
let's do the walk that they have
to go on to get water. And I mean,

523
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:23,581
I've gone 45 minutes an hour walking
with a women because it's the women that

524
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:27,940
collect the water in that culture because
the men are often in the fields or

525
00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:30,740
they're off hunting or they're
off doing stuff. So, um,

526
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,880
the women go and get the water and
it can be a 45 minute hour hike, um,

527
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:39,070
with these 20 liter Jerry
cans and a 20 liters,

528
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:42,580
I think full is like 40 or
44 pounds whenever it's full.

529
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,910
And they're going to get dirty water,
dirty water,

530
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:50,320
that is a 45 minute hike away from him
and they're bringing back one or two of

531
00:30:50,321 --> 00:30:52,930
those 44 pound Jerry cans.

532
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,650
So some of these more boutique pygmy
women are literally carrying their body

533
00:30:56,651 --> 00:31:01,000
weight or more and water and it's
just dirty. Any people, right.

534
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,901
Wow.
Yeah.

535
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:06,901
Most of the hunters we were given this
film area treatment fully a flareon a

536
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:10,840
worm is this crazy kind of,
it comes from black fly bites,

537
00:31:10,841 --> 00:31:14,650
but it's from like contaminated water
that the flies goto and breed and they

538
00:31:14,651 --> 00:31:18,130
come and they bite you and then you can
get, you can get river blindness from it.

539
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:23,110
Oh, it's river blindness. River
blindness is a disease that also,

540
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:26,260
there's a pygmy woman named Mama Mary Amo.
And uh,

541
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:30,310
I love her to death and she's so
great. Um, but she's lost five of her,

542
00:31:30,311 --> 00:31:35,100
seven children due to this
illness and her husband. Um,

543
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,750
and there's, uh, there's
a video on it too,

544
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:40,840
and I think it's called the opportunity
at freedom or something that's on the

545
00:31:40,841 --> 00:31:44,800
water foresight. But five or seven
children are gone and her husband,

546
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:48,070
and it's all waterborne disease
and she has river blindness. So,

547
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:52,270
not only has she lost all her, not all of
her children, but five and her husband,

548
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:56,290
but she's blind and she's blind
because of, of river blindness.

549
00:31:56,291 --> 00:32:00,910
And so though the worms getting your
body and there's five different kinds of

550
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:04,150
malarial worms in one kind of the worms,

551
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,420
like the babies go to your retina I think,

552
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,750
and they like attack and
eat and live and sleep, um,

553
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,500
in the retina of your eyes until you have,
until you have no vision left.

554
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,150
And four of the five
don't, don't do that. Um,

555
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,710
but what it does is it irritates your
skin. Supposedly I've had it, um,

556
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:26,860
I've had to take the treatment.
Um, whenever I took the
pill, it made my body itch.

557
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,740
And that's how you know
if you had it or not, um,

558
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,590
as if your skin itches cause
and so knowing the parasites,

559
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,770
it's killing the worms, killing the
parasites. And so what I was like, man,

560
00:32:35,771 --> 00:32:37,720
if I have this and if our team has it,

561
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:39,950
cause we treated our
well drillers first in,

562
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:44,140
some of them broke out in rashes and
hives and really were itching and she's a

563
00:32:44,141 --> 00:32:47,550
part of it. If you go to that
region, you're going to get it. Um,

564
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:50,570
and if you're out there long enough,
maybe not if you go for a week,

565
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,440
but if you go for an extended
period of time, you're,

566
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,180
you need to at least take the treatment
to make sure you don't have that. Wow.

567
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,420
And so I was like, man, if I,

568
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,860
if I supposedly had it and if my
team has it, then I know the pygmies.

569
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:07,750
It's like ravaging them, you know? And
so we went to the different villages and,

570
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:11,390
and took a scale. And, and from that we
knew how much medicine we should give him.

571
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:16,190
I talked to this guy, doctor
Peter Hotez. He's, um, he's, uh,

572
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:20,350
an expert in tropical
diseases. Okay. And, uh,

573
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,910
he said that he blew me away.

574
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:28,210
He said that 100% of people that live
in tropical climates of parasites.

575
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:32,930
Oh yeah, I totally 100% believe
that that's, that's insane.

576
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:37,730
It's insane. You live there, you know,
it, uh, this environment that you're in,

577
00:33:37,731 --> 00:33:40,300
that you're going and you're, you're,
you're, you're digging these wells, like,

578
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,990
describe to us if you could,
like, what is it like, I mean,

579
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,080
you're talking about intensely dense,
vetted vegetation.

580
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:52,700
What kind of like animal life and what
kind of wildlife is around you and bugs?

581
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,970
I have bugs. It's nuts. Um, yeah. My,

582
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:00,590
my wife's first camping trip ever
was in the Congo. Um, he took four.

583
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:04,390
You showed us photos of it.
It's hilarious. It's time
you were here. Yeah. Um,

584
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:08,840
so it was a big eye opening experience
for her, but the vegetation, it's nuts.

585
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,030
So the Amazon is the biggest
rain forest in the world,

586
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:15,020
but the Congo is the second largest.
But as it is,

587
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:19,760
the densest, the Ma, the thickest,
it's the hardest to navigate through.

588
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:24,920
Um, uh, there's parts in Uganda that
barely touched the stuff in Congo,

589
00:34:24,921 --> 00:34:29,180
but they call it the impenetrable forest
because a, they're sayings that it's,

590
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,330
um, uh, I forget,

591
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:36,440
but it's harder for a fish to swim through
the or the rivers there because even

592
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,300
the rivers are thick vegetation and
all this stuff and um, and some parts.

593
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:45,080
But dude, it's, it's crazy like
walking through and hiking through.

594
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:48,350
I have a picture that's going to be in
my book of have been walking and I was

595
00:34:48,351 --> 00:34:51,110
like, how much of this do we
have to walk through? It was,

596
00:34:51,111 --> 00:34:56,111
we were literally machete using a machete
to get through to this pygmy village.

597
00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:00,080
And I'm like, Dang. They walked through
this every day where it's like the,

598
00:35:00,081 --> 00:35:03,050
you're just walking through the
thicket that's going across your face,

599
00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:06,500
going across your arms.
There's bugs latching on to
you while you're doing that.

600
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:11,630
There's mosquitoes like crazy
at all times. There's the ants.

601
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:17,360
The ants will literally look like
a small creek or rushing river. Um,

602
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:22,010
I've seen on at least it literally,
at least two foot wide,

603
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,140
and you can hear them,
you can hear him.

604
00:35:24,141 --> 00:35:29,141
It's two foot wide of ants and it's just
a black river because it's these ants

605
00:35:29,181 --> 00:35:32,300
that are just rushing, running
in and out of things. Um,

606
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,640
and yeah, so it's, there's bumblebees
there that are like bright, uh,

607
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:41,390
like the, or they have a bright
blue or purple on their back.

608
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:43,230
I'm kind of partially
colorblind, but, but uh,

609
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,500
but I can see them and literally
threw the size of a golf ball.

610
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,710
They're like perfectly round.
They're perfectly round golf ball,

611
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,030
golf ball for a Bumblebee,
God for a Bumblebee,

612
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:58,350
100% like a golf ball.
And what we would do is Emily,

613
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,970
my wife brought a, a racket that had those
little, it's like a little taser for,

614
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:08,010
for bugs. Um, and it's in the shape
of a tennis racket and we just,

615
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,680
there's one village,
uh,

616
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:14,681
Andy Kwok claw and it's got tons of
those golf ball bumblebees and they're

617
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:18,600
vicious to the bud on those
things is just the looks wicked.

618
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,140
You don't want to get stung by it. And
whenever you do it, it leaves like this.

619
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:24,730
It looks like you got shot by
like buckshot and a little bitty,

620
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:29,280
a little bitty golf ball
size. WELP wow. Um, but yeah,

621
00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:33,240
we just smack those things with
that little Taser racquet thing. Um,

622
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,610
it's gotta be one of the
wildest places on earth, right?

623
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:40,110
I mean next to the Amazon. It's probably
like right up there. Yeah. Yeah. It's,

624
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:45,220
it's nuts. There's a, you know what, maybe
maybe this would give you an idea. Um,

625
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,600
Jamie, me, we get those pictures.
Um, you can start with that.

626
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,850
What is this right here? I wanted to
bring you a gift, man. I'm from the Congo,

627
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,870
but uh, actually go behind those
pictures first and check out. Uh,

628
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,060
but if you leave him that aren't great,

629
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:05,640
but that CMG and I knew you would really
connect with this little dude. Um,

630
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:09,450
we should have a picture up of a,
do you have a, just the first one

631
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:14,760
and uh,
in San g here is from a,

632
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,910
we call it tuned and tuned
to it just means whole,

633
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,600
but we call it the hole in the forest.
And, um, he's a little dude. And,

634
00:37:22,601 --> 00:37:25,770
and in that village they make those,
uh,

635
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:29,460
those little hand prints
or actually the cloth.

636
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,820
So the cloth is this like bark cloth
and it's like a traditional way that the

637
00:37:33,821 --> 00:37:36,030
[inaudible] booty.
Pygmies like make stuff for artwork.

638
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,570
Does that cloth that he's holding,
he's made out of bark. Yes. Uh,

639
00:37:39,571 --> 00:37:43,400
actually reach in there and you'll
see the, the actual cloth that says,

640
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:47,280
so this was kind of a
thank you, um, way that,

641
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,090
that they kind of gave me a few things
to remember him by and to say like,

642
00:37:51,091 --> 00:37:54,830
tell your friends and people that
supported this. Like thank you. Um,

643
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:59,970
but seeing g is, he's probably 12, I
would say this is bark. Yeah. Spark.

644
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,880
Wow. Spark cloth. So it feels
kind of like a canvas and uh,

645
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:10,730
sorry on the plane and got a bent up. How
do they do this? What are they doing? Um,

646
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,380
I'm actually not sure that it's the,
it's the bark and they beat it down.

647
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,970
They like beat it down, pressurize
it or something and, and uh, uh,

648
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,120
or put a lot of pressure when they're
doing it. What kind of trees us do,

649
00:38:21,121 --> 00:38:24,900
you know, I don't, I actually
don't know. There's so many trails,

650
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:30,060
like a flexible cardboard. Yeah. So,

651
00:38:30,061 --> 00:38:32,610
and they, they'll do like their
own kind of paintings and stuff.

652
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:36,970
It's really like traditional and you
can like even Google a bark cloth and I

653
00:38:36,971 --> 00:38:41,130
think it comes up with the pygmies.
That's awesome. Thanks very much.

654
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,020
That's amazing dude. That's his
hand print. Wow. And so time. Yeah.

655
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:49,390
He's probably 12. None of them
really know their, their age,

656
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:53,950
just because they don't really have a, a
calendar and don't keep up with it. And,

657
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,690
uh, don't have school or
anything. Like, no, I phones,
no hyphens, no hyphens, no. Uh,

658
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,940
whatever it is, Google, Google calendars.
Wow. But, uh, the next picture, um,

659
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,630
that's right there with Ya.
But, uh, it's their village.

660
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,910
And there you go. Uh, on my, uh, my right,

661
00:39:12,911 --> 00:39:16,150
so if you're looking at the picture on
the left, that's, that's Lorinda. And uh,

662
00:39:16,151 --> 00:39:20,770
he's my translator and our director
of implementation to his right.

663
00:39:20,771 --> 00:39:25,030
The guy with the hat, uh, that
is, uh, Leo may doesn't dope.

664
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,410
He's awesome.

665
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:31,330
That's the chief chief Leo May and
he's such a great dude and he's the

666
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:35,960
grandfather seeing g two over
from me. The lady that uh, uh,

667
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,550
I have my arm around them and then yeah,
right there that she flew home,

668
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:43,570
his wife and they're basically the parents
of San sankeys right in front of me

669
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,100
squatting down.
I'm writing from my right leg and uh,

670
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:52,870
so they're raising him because his
parents passed away. Um, but uh,

671
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,160
what I want to show you about saying gee
is he has a passion that's common with

672
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:59,440
you and I got to be there
for two really cool things.

673
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,780
If you can go to the next picture and a,

674
00:40:01,781 --> 00:40:05,350
that's the stack and near your thing too.
But here's the,

675
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:11,290
the village at night and that dude's
got a sweet little guitar thing he made.

676
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,913
He used the,

677
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:18,180
he used wire from a tire to make the
strings strings of the string instruments,

678
00:40:18,891 --> 00:40:22,330
steel belted radial tire, like that
kind of shit. Yeah, I think so.

679
00:40:22,331 --> 00:40:26,350
I mean it was like a old abandoned tire
and he just made this thing out of wood

680
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,620
guitar. He got the wire, like
stripped it out of the rough,

681
00:40:30,621 --> 00:40:33,910
stripped it out of the rubber,
and made himself a stringed instrument.

682
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:37,510
But if you send these over my back,
and this is just us,

683
00:40:37,511 --> 00:40:41,830
this is how we learn the most
about how we can help them.

684
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,720
When we sit around the campfire with them,

685
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,450
we've kind of made a goofy name for it,

686
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:48,910
but we call it campfire university
because that's where they,

687
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:52,060
that's where they take us to school.
Whenever we're sitting around, we,

688
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:55,930
that's where we can hear the truth
about how they're really treated. Um,

689
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:59,760
no one else is around like any of
their oppressors and stuff. Um,

690
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:03,940
they're able to just be
themselves. Sometimes we would
pretend to be asleep. Um,

691
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:05,110
so other people would leave,

692
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,490
but now this is on their own land
and they have like freedom to,

693
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:11,410
to just chill and relax. Wow. Um,

694
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:16,250
and then if you know the
next picture, but, uh,

695
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:20,860
I just alone. Okay. So he got
that picture also, but that's, uh,

696
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:26,270
one of the first antelope wild kind
of bushmeat that I got to eat. Um,

697
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,520
so they call it, they call everything
bushmeat. Yeah. Basically I've,

698
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:35,480
I've had monkey, which I realize I
probably shouldn't do that again.

699
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,000
It's probably not healthy,
right? Yeah. You can get a bull.

700
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,520
And so that's how the Bulla from monkey,

701
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,840
and I shouldn't laugh, but a, I
didn't know. I didn't know about, uh,

702
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,620
that's how you get a bullet and then all
of a sudden the bullet virus broke out

703
00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:51,530
like literally a month or two after I
ate the monkey and all sudden like, oh,

704
00:41:51,531 --> 00:41:56,510
Geez. Uh, so this, uh, antelope did
the shoot this with bow and Arrow? Yup.

705
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,930
They got that one with the bow
and arrow seeing Dee got his, uh,

706
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:04,400
in the next picture, uh, he got
his with a spear and this is, uh,

707
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:08,780
is Christ. This is his for what
they do is they chase it into a net.

708
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:11,060
So they string these
nets up, uh, through the,

709
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:15,650
through the trees and then the
men and the women sometimes too,

710
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:19,010
they go through with like leaves and
other things that make sounds and they

711
00:42:19,011 --> 00:42:23,480
scare the antelope into their, their nets.
I've seen on how the string this out,

712
00:42:23,481 --> 00:42:28,460
these nets can be, man, they can
be a football field in length.

713
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:32,180
And then they scare the antelope into
it and then they have to catch up to it

714
00:42:32,181 --> 00:42:36,920
before it escapes. And, uh, they
spirit. So Sankey speared that.

715
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,310
That's your little
dude. Wow. And then, uh,

716
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:45,680
the next one's pretty cool just holding
the head so they probably could have

717
00:42:45,681 --> 00:42:50,630
done ed too. Right. Eat the brains,
eat every part of the tongue, the eyes,

718
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,740
hey,
don't waste anything.

719
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:55,490
And that in that village was the first
time I saw him eating a turtle and like,

720
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,600
I'm not that turtles that strange to eat,
but they even eat the shell. Why? Um,

721
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:03,770
yeah, I know it sounds crazy. I saw him,
I'm like, doesn't that hurt? But uh,

722
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:04,250
they would,

723
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:08,470
they would cook it over the fire and
I guess it would weaken the shell. Um,

724
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,830
I think, uh, but it still sounded really
crunchy. So they're chewing on the shell.

725
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:16,520
The shell eat every part of it
and a lot the fuck man. Yeah, but,

726
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:20,300
but I mean for them though, it's if
that's the only food they got, you know,

727
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,860
I have no idea.

728
00:43:21,861 --> 00:43:26,861
I saw a crocodile once eat a turtle
and I thought that that crocodile was

729
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:31,850
fucking crazy. But that's a
crocodile. They didn't think a human,

730
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,720
a turtle shell at least.
Yeah,

731
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:38,500
I've been out in Louisiana with
my grandpa official soup in the,

732
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:42,530
well the Cajun guy just came over cause
we kept catching turtles and he would uh,

733
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:47,180
he'd cut off the head cause he can't
really get your a hook pack and then he

734
00:43:47,181 --> 00:43:50,870
would just open it up and see if they
had an exit them and right there without

735
00:43:50,871 --> 00:43:53,240
cooking it, without really cleaning.
He just popped the eggs in his mouth.

736
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,680
I was like, this guy's crazy. So that
was in Louisiana. It was down in the bio.

737
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,110
But uh,
let me go to the next picture.

738
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,270
These people have a hard time finding
food or is this like fairly common to eat

739
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,810
all these different antelopes and
whatever. This is, what is this a cat?

740
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:11,750
This is Sanji second kill.

741
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:14,830
So is there for his first
kill and a second kill and a,

742
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,900
they were months apart
though. Um, this is,

743
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:21,610
I think they call it a
large spotted Janae and,

744
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,230
or I think I'm pronouncing it right.
It's a g e n,

745
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:29,180
e t and it looks like a cross between,
I dunno,

746
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:32,910
a mongoose and a baby leopard or
something like that. But I've been,

747
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:37,470
someone tried to sell me Okapi meat.
They were seeing that animal. It's a,

748
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,720
it's got the butt of a zebra.

749
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:44,010
It's got the body of antelope and the
head of a giraffe. I know it sounds crazy.

750
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:46,320
It's the only in the Congo and
that's what it looks like at least.

751
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,240
But it's in the Giraffa day family.

752
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:53,320
And so it's the only other
surviving animal in that family. Um,

753
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,240
it's actually with the eye. Oh, look
at that. Freaky fuck is fine. Yeah.

754
00:44:57,241 --> 00:45:00,190
I have seen these things
before. They look fake. Yeah.

755
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:01,650
It looks like a mythical creature.

756
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,600
Like I'm in the draft family and uh,

757
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:09,090
someone's tried to sell me the meat of it.
It's an endangered species.

758
00:45:09,091 --> 00:45:11,370
It wasn't a big, yeah, endangered species.

759
00:45:11,371 --> 00:45:14,880
And I would have gotten in a lot of
trouble if I got caught doing that.

760
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:20,130
If you got caught, I'll even try to put
me in life in prison or something. Really?

761
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:22,020
Probably. Yeah. If you had the means,

762
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,740
but how would they know
where you got the meat from?

763
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:27,670
How it had to know that it
was an okapi a B. He just,

764
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:32,640
he was selling me the button. Oh, I see
what the people eat. Zebras too. Right.

765
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,830
Um, I believe so. That's gotta be
an gone insanely tough meat. Yeah.

766
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,270
So back to my original question,

767
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:43,020
is it difficult for these people to
find meat or is it like a really rich,

768
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,640
a lot harder than it used to be?

769
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,640
A lot harder because a lot of
the deforestation is happening.

770
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:52,680
And so I've literally been able
to look up, see the, uh, the sun,

771
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:56,190
see that the is clear, uh,
through the canvas and stuff.

772
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,040
And then it sounds like thunder.
Um,

773
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,870
and it's because they're
cutting down these huge trees.

774
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:04,620
And so that makes it really hard for the
pygmies to hunt because the animals are

775
00:46:04,621 --> 00:46:06,990
skittish. They get scared,
they get frightened. They, the,

776
00:46:06,991 --> 00:46:10,980
there are a lot tougher to get.
Wow. Um, so yeah, there's the,

777
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:15,780
that's when he came back and first
showed me this tiny little a cap thing.

778
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:20,100
And so how do they cook that? Um, they
skin it, they keep the meat or sorry,

779
00:46:20,101 --> 00:46:23,880
they keep the skin to make a hat
or a little like trophy out of,

780
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,433
um,

781
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:29,460
and then that's the spirit got it with
that was a smaller one is grandpa has one

782
00:46:29,461 --> 00:46:33,480
that he killed an elephant
with. Um, but yeah,

783
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:38,720
they put it over a tripod of sticks and
then they wrap the meat and leafs and

784
00:46:39,901 --> 00:46:44,460
they kind of smoke it so that
it, it, it seems to last, I mean,

785
00:46:44,461 --> 00:46:49,110
they smoke it and it lasts longer, so
dry it out. Yeah. That's, um, and then,

786
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:49,680
and then they'll,

787
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,250
they'll soak it again and like boil
it so that it kind of gets back.

788
00:46:53,251 --> 00:46:58,110
It's not so dry at times.
Like, I mean, it is a fish too,

789
00:46:58,111 --> 00:47:01,800
and other things. So it's a method
of preserving. It's sort of like, um,

790
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:06,300
the native Americans did that with
buffalo and they do that in Mexico too.

791
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,980
Um, they, uh, they,

792
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:11,940
they take the buffalo and they make
really thin slices and they dry it in the

793
00:47:11,941 --> 00:47:14,460
sun and then they,
um,

794
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:17,310
they're rehydrated again and cook it.

795
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:22,230
And so kind of like with their situation
of them being the first citizens of

796
00:47:22,231 --> 00:47:24,090
Congo,
that's the way we always use with them.

797
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:28,330
The terminology similar to the native
Americans and what we did here, um,

798
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,400
pushed them off their land,
took the land from him.

799
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,000
That's what happened to the pygmies.
And so that's kind of, it's similar to,

800
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:37,270
to something that I was thinking
is, hey, we could get these people,

801
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:40,840
these little kind of reservations.
We have 10 different plots of land.

802
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:42,940
All of them are 247 acres,

803
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,080
or eight of them are two are ones
like half a square kilometer.

804
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:51,520
So like one 20 and the other is
like close to 500 acres. Um, and so,

805
00:47:51,521 --> 00:47:54,490
but that's their land. They'll pass
down. And what we want to do is,

806
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,510
on one of them, we started replanting
trees that are targeted for deforestation.

807
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,110
So one of our agriculturalists that
were interning, we gave them a goal.

808
00:48:02,111 --> 00:48:04,690
It seems Dramani great dude.
Um,

809
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,200
we want them to replant a thousand
trees and we're like, hey,

810
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:11,920
you can feed the anyone that helps, you
know, the pygmies, give them breakfast,

811
00:48:11,921 --> 00:48:16,660
lunch, dinner. Uh, and we'll
give them like a day's wage
and teach them how to, to,

812
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:21,580
to, to make money. Um, and
how to, you know, work for
the first time making money.

813
00:48:21,581 --> 00:48:26,581
And so when he came back we were blown
away because he had replanted 3,500

814
00:48:26,861 --> 00:48:29,140
trees,
3,500.

815
00:48:29,141 --> 00:48:32,530
So that's also what we want to do
too is a preserve their culture.

816
00:48:32,531 --> 00:48:36,970
They love the trees. They don't cut
down the big ones. So the market where,

817
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,560
where are these trees going to?

818
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:42,890
Cause this is an issue that going on the
Amazon as was like Mahogany hard that's

819
00:48:42,891 --> 00:48:44,290
out there. We have big, heavy,

820
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:48,760
heavy hardwoods and they take a
long time to grow too, right? Yeah.

821
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:49,421
Yeah.

822
00:48:49,421 --> 00:48:53,290
They take a long time
chopping down hundred and then
they're doing it on a daily

823
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:56,320
base trees that you could drive an 18
wheeler through. So that's why there's,

824
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:00,310
there's times that a tree falls and I'm
like, is it about terrain? Is it thunder?

825
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,870
Because it's, it's this huge, massive
old tree that's being cut down.

826
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:09,430
You could literally drive and look those,
the redwoods they have and yeah,

827
00:49:09,431 --> 00:49:10,450
I would,
I would say they're not,

828
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:13,840
they're not as big as the redwoods
and some of them are that big, but,

829
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:17,270
but some aren't. I mean, some you
could drive a mini Cooper through,

830
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:22,010
but yeah, some are, some are massive
and they're just cutting them down. Um,

831
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:26,110
just a perspective that you must gain
from being in this insane environment.

832
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:30,520
It's got to be a really,
for a lack of a better word,

833
00:49:30,521 --> 00:49:35,320
enriching experience. Yeah. I
mean, it's so good for the soul.

834
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:38,560
I would say just your
heart. You, you feel, um,

835
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:41,710
you feel like you're a part of
something greater than yourself,

836
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,090
something bigger than yourself.

837
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:47,230
And I would say that that's where a lot
of my struggles in life came from was

838
00:49:47,231 --> 00:49:52,150
when I was so focused on something small,
which is myself,

839
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,530
I was like magnifying glass or putting
myself under microscope in my life.

840
00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:01,890
And it's like whenever I took the focus
off of me and put it on others like it,

841
00:50:02,191 --> 00:50:06,700
it gave me such a,
a greater sense of purpose in life of man,

842
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:10,480
I don't need to live for
myself. Um, like this problem.

843
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:14,260
Like what if I could be part of a little,
a little part,

844
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:18,160
the little link in the chain,
um, to help to, to beat in the,

845
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:22,660
in the problem and whatever small problems
anybody he has in comparison to the

846
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:24,620
issues that they have there.
It's,

847
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,070
it's one of the things that
happens to people when,

848
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:31,970
uh, takes place when there's any sort
of a crisis. Like after nine, 11,

849
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:37,130
one of the weirdest aspects of being in
New York was how friendly everybody was.

850
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:40,610
Like everybody Kinda had this new
found perspective. They had this new,

851
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,810
instead of dealing with the
stress and the, the, the,

852
00:50:43,811 --> 00:50:47,540
the grind to the big city and the traffic
and all the nonsense and all the agro

853
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:49,760
behavior that people normally have.
It wasn't there.

854
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:52,580
It was like people were friendly
and they were nice and kind.

855
00:50:52,581 --> 00:50:56,840
It's like they had put it in perspective
because of the attack and it's just,

856
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,660
it's a shame that human
beings are like that, that we,

857
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:03,860
we have to have something kind of crazy
happened to us for us to predict. Yeah.

858
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:05,960
To unite us and to appreciate,
right.

859
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:09,610
Yeah. And just say, I would say
there, it's almost like they are,

860
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:14,190
are like that the kind of what you're
saying about New York and not that the one

861
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:17,920
constantly like constantly like that
they're constantly appreciative for

862
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:22,110
anything that they get. Anything that
they get for that day. The, even,

863
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,540
even whenever they're working underneath
their slave masters and they're getting,

864
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:26,943
um,

865
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:32,030
a minnow for a full day's
Labor or two bananas, um,

866
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:35,980
for a family of four or five that are
literally working from sunup to sundown to

867
00:51:35,981 --> 00:51:39,320
get two bananas to share.
Like there,

868
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,950
like whenever we talk to
them about it, yes. They'll,
they'll say, we need more. We,

869
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:47,980
this is slavery, this is a slave labor.
Like it's terrible. It's, you know,

870
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:52,420
but whenever they get that food at the
end of the day and like they're thankful

871
00:51:52,421 --> 00:51:54,400
for it. Like, because they got to have it,

872
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:59,680
but the oppressors use that as a way to
keep them hungry so that they have to

873
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:02,390
come back the next day
and work similar story.

874
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:05,830
That's a story as old as
time, right? Yeah. Hey,

875
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,150
can we show that next picture in that?
Sorry, I'll, I'll try to bust this out.

876
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:15,190
So this I love this is saying, Geez,
grandmother, she's wearing bins,

877
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:17,410
bins on the right with a blue shirt.

878
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:20,370
He's our director and uh,

879
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,920
got Kula is behind them in the blue
shirt and right in front of them with the

880
00:52:23,921 --> 00:52:28,510
sunglasses on his Mama Leo. What is
she wearing? Runner waste leaves.

881
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:32,740
Leaves. At least she'll Sushi tied
Wa uh, vines and leaves together.

882
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,240
Um, and yeah, whenever, if,

883
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:39,160
if cameras probably weren't out
like they would like it doesn't,

884
00:52:39,161 --> 00:52:42,670
it's not a big deal like close or
not close or anything like that.

885
00:52:42,671 --> 00:52:45,550
But whenever we bust out a
camera because it's like, hey,

886
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,260
this is going to be a cool celebration.

887
00:52:47,261 --> 00:52:49,990
So why we bust out camera's
different than the show up.

888
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:52,930
Blow up and blow out so that we
have pictures. What's so cool?

889
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:57,470
One of the greatest gifts I've
ever given Mama Leo, me, uh,

890
00:52:57,610 --> 00:53:00,370
is a picture of herself,

891
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,110
a picture of her and sang g a
picture of her and Leo, me. Um,

892
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,970
what we do is we print up these pictures,

893
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:10,210
we get them laminated and they've
never had a picture of himself.

894
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:14,200
And so we're able to go back and give
them these pictures and they'll always be

895
00:53:14,201 --> 00:53:18,460
able to cherish and remember this
moment, do they have mirrors? There's a,

896
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:22,750
there might be a half
broken mirror that's like,

897
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,620
I mean very tiny, um,
like compact. Yeah. Right.

898
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,990
And it might be like crushed are broken
and they might have that for the whole

899
00:53:30,991 --> 00:53:35,100
village. Wow. Um, so
it's, but some places, no,

900
00:53:35,101 --> 00:53:36,000
some places not at all.

901
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:40,320
Some places I give them my iPhone and
they get to look at themselves and they're

902
00:53:40,321 --> 00:53:44,290
just like, oh my goodness. Cause they've
only seen themselves really. And uh, and,

903
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,380
and reflection of water
and stuff like that.

904
00:53:46,381 --> 00:53:48,120
And how long before they
start taking selfies?

905
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:57,630
The kissy face or, right, no, I've even,
I've even had the, uh, the duck face.

906
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:02,640
Um, there were duck lips, but, uh, I mean,

907
00:54:02,641 --> 00:54:04,950
on my Instagram at the,
the big pig meat,

908
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:08,490
there's some pictures of me
actually given this village, uh, uh,

909
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,430
pictures and dude,
some of their expressions,

910
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:14,190
whenever they get to see a picture
of themselves for the first time,

911
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,890
it's like the craziest
looks in their eyes.

912
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:21,520
Seeing themselves on a piece of
paper would only on imagine calling.

913
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:26,520
Imagine seeing yourself in a photograph
for the first time. Yeah. Wow. But,

914
00:54:26,521 --> 00:54:31,110
uh, another thing that we just completely
take for granted, right? Oh, there's a,

915
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:35,480
I also brought you something that,
uh, that's inside that bag. Um,

916
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:39,330
I know you're a hunter. You like, that's
why I get you those hunting pictures.

917
00:54:39,331 --> 00:54:44,220
I also got you some like handmade
knives that are from there,

918
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:48,900
from the Congo.
How do they make these by hand?

919
00:54:48,901 --> 00:54:53,190
They like hammer on them. And then,
uh, what do they get? The metal? Yeah,

920
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:56,200
I'll just feel like they're
like butter knives. Yeah.

921
00:54:56,201 --> 00:55:00,270
It looks just like a American.
They made this. Yeah. How

922
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,960
actually Josh helped me come up with
a joke to try to, to cause a joke.

923
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:11,430
Yeah. That one's a joke because,
uh, but I tried to get a joke.

924
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:17,160
This is the real one. Rascal you, I was
like, dude, there's a copyright on this.

925
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:21,660
That one, that one looked too
prettiest from our hotel. Uh Oh wow.

926
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:25,800
But this one is the real deal.
Um, so they made it out of a nail.

927
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,630
Some of the,
the,

928
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:32,370
the people that we're working on like
doing deforestation and like cutting down

929
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:33,720
the trees and they'll,

930
00:55:33,721 --> 00:55:38,721
they'll build themselves a ladders and
so they're able to take the old nails out

931
00:55:40,651 --> 00:55:45,090
of these ladders and stuff, um,
and make themselves a knife.

932
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:49,230
And so that's actually handmade
from seeing keys. Uh, grandfather,

933
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:53,250
the chief chief Leo may cause his hands
so small that he can actually use that

934
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:57,060
or do they use it with like a few fingers?
He might use it with like three,

935
00:55:57,061 --> 00:56:01,530
but yeah, his, I mean, the dude might
be four foot eight, four foot nine.

936
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:06,590
Um, the, the average height of the move
booty pygmy man is four foot seven. Um,

937
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,350
so yeah, their hands are smaller
and stuff like that. And so they,

938
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:14,670
I think this into a piece of wood
somehow grabbed the other one and I'm not

939
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:18,930
actually, they push it down on that
wood. That's, that's the original way.

940
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:23,590
You see how it's a a
nail. This is nuts. Yeah.

941
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,180
So,
wow.

942
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:28,840
So this nail flattens out to
be that why that's incredible.

943
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:33,430
Do what he found was the old a piece of,
so in Congo,

944
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:37,510
the Belgian Belgian Congo with
like King Leopold, the second, um,

945
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,680
who is due to as evil as Hitler,
um,

946
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:45,700
I mean they, they say during
his reign of Congo, he, he's,

947
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:49,090
he said in Europe that he
was like the savior of Congo,

948
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,630
that he was helping all the Congolese,
but really it was extorting them for,

949
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:55,420
for mainly rubber in ivory.

950
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:58,600
And there was an estimated
20 million people.

951
00:56:58,601 --> 00:57:02,230
And there's a book called King Leopold's
ghost in the guy had a big old beard.

952
00:57:02,231 --> 00:57:06,970
Kind of like, I have one of those
pictures with saying, Gee, um,

953
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,610
but uh,
but what,

954
00:57:09,611 --> 00:57:13,090
what they say was that it's an
estimated 10 million people,

955
00:57:13,091 --> 00:57:15,270
half the population of Congo,
that,

956
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:18,280
that he was responsible for
killing and murdering Jesus.

957
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:22,480
So they call that like the African
Holocaust or one of the first holocaust,

958
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:25,780
because there was, you
know, six some, I mean,

959
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:29,370
I'm not sure about the Jewish holocaust,
6 million or something like that. Um,

960
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,470
but this was eight to 10 million people.

961
00:57:32,471 --> 00:57:35,280
Half the half of the Congo was,

962
00:57:35,281 --> 00:57:39,850
was murdered and everything else just
over rubber, the rubber boom. And uh,

963
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:44,380
and ivory and I had, I had a slingshot
for you from like their original rubber,

964
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:49,330
uh, but it kind of like rotted and broke.
So anyways, the original rubber. Yeah.

965
00:57:49,331 --> 00:57:53,470
It's like, it's, it's like white whenever
it first comes out and it's, it's, it's,

966
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:57,190
uh, they just made a slingshot. It
was seen Ge and so I brought it.

967
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,190
Yeah. They, they know like
birds and stuff and trees. Um,

968
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:05,590
so I've seen him eat in parrots and
African gray [inaudible] stats. Yeah.

969
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:09,460
Anything they can get me in.
Um, they'll, they'll knock a,

970
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:12,790
and it might sound bad to
our culture, whatever, but
this is their food, you know,

971
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:15,010
so, um, but they'll,

972
00:58:15,011 --> 00:58:18,460
they'll shoot like a nest and a
whatever comes down, you know,

973
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:22,330
if it's baby birds or mama bird
or eggs or something like that,

974
00:58:22,331 --> 00:58:24,580
that's free game.
So yeah,

975
00:58:24,581 --> 00:58:28,780
I mean we are very privileged that we can
just go to a supermarket and buy food.

976
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,060
So we have these ideas of what
you should and shouldn't do,

977
00:58:31,061 --> 00:58:34,810
but when you're starving to death, you
will eat whatever you can get ahold of.

978
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:38,590
And whenever the outsiders make it so
much even harder for you to hunt because

979
00:58:38,591 --> 00:58:41,680
they're cutting down the trees and it's
making the animal skittish and scared

980
00:58:41,681 --> 00:58:43,590
and so much harder for you to find them.
Yeah.

981
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:47,620
So there's no regulation whatsoever.
How many trees they can chop down?

982
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:52,420
Not at all. I would say. I mean,
this might not be a real stat,

983
00:58:52,421 --> 00:58:53,380
but in my mind,

984
00:58:53,381 --> 00:58:57,700
80 90% of the logging in
Congo has gotta be illegal.

985
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,920
They just go out there,
here's a big old tree,

986
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:03,820
let's cut it down because it's worth so
much money. And who was doing this? What,

987
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:06,220
what country up all over.

988
00:59:06,221 --> 00:59:11,221
And they'll bring in trucks from
Kenya and Tanzania and Rwanda and um,

989
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:15,880
there's some like big businessmen that
then sell these hardwoods to China,

990
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:20,230
the u s the Brazil. I mean, just different
big countries that they send it out.

991
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:24,080
And I've seen these
hardwood, uh, on these roads,

992
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:29,081
sometimes three fourths of a serious three
fourths of an 18 wheeler or a lawyer.

993
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:31,760
Uh, Laurie is what we call them there. Um,

994
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:36,470
it can be completely sunk in mud or it
can just be fallen off of a face of a

995
00:59:36,471 --> 00:59:39,870
cliff. Um, because it's so overloaded. Um,

996
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:43,460
they fill up these containers just
so full with this heavy, heavy,

997
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:44,630
heavy wood because if,

998
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:48,800
if they can get it back and then they're
going to make a ton of money off of it.

999
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:49,640
Um,

1000
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:54,560
so they just overload it cause it's so
hard to get from point a to B to like

1001
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:59,120
Mombasa and Kenyata where they can ship
out this stuff. It's just so depressing.

1002
00:59:59,121 --> 01:00:02,090
Sometimes when you think about the
damage that people are capable of and the

1003
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,850
insensitivity that people can exhibit.
Yeah.

1004
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:09,740
It's just that they're just go
there and just take all that wood,

1005
01:00:09,741 --> 01:00:13,540
chop it all down. Fuck all these
people over the, the, the whole,

1006
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:18,920
just the fact that it's a small amount
of people that are doing it too,

1007
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:23,570
but yet it affects an enormous amount of
people worldwide. Absolutely. Absolutely.

1008
01:00:23,571 --> 01:00:26,970
From, I think, I think they said, um,

1009
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:29,940
I forget where I got as
a reputable source. Um,

1010
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:34,990
but the size of Texas has been cut down
from the Congo rain forest in the last

1011
01:00:35,451 --> 01:00:40,451
like just 20 or 25 years last 2025
years of the rain forest in Congo,

1012
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:44,300
the size of Texas, which that's
where I'm from. I mean that's huge.

1013
01:00:44,301 --> 01:00:49,250
It's 13 hours from east to west, maybe
more, uh, in Texas on good roads.

1014
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:54,590
Um, so just to imagine like the size of,
of the impact that that's insane. He can,

1015
01:00:54,591 --> 01:00:56,060
it's nuts.
That's insane.

1016
01:00:56,061 --> 01:00:59,060
And then to think about the fact that it
takes hundreds of years replenished as

1017
01:00:59,061 --> 01:01:02,450
far as if they do get replenished because
the environment that they're growing

1018
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:04,010
in,
it gets changed.

1019
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:07,160
As soon as you chop everything down and
the sun bakes the land and then there's

1020
01:01:07,161 --> 01:01:10,490
less rain and stuff. Fuck man. Absolutely.

1021
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:15,610
That's going to be such a strange place
to go while you're there and you're

1022
01:01:16,011 --> 01:01:21,011
trying to help and you're trying to
replenish and help these communities,

1023
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:25,280
give them water and help them sustain
and then you're hearing these trees fall

1024
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:27,480
and knowing that there's this,

1025
01:01:27,481 --> 01:01:32,240
these insensitive people just chopping
down trees left and right and fucking the

1026
01:01:32,241 --> 01:01:37,100
whole thing up. Yeah, it's nuts.
Like, uh, when, when my wife came,

1027
01:01:37,101 --> 01:01:41,380
we walked through a field that
had been just ravaged by the,

1028
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,780
the illegal loggers and stuff and um,

1029
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,370
she was blown away because these trees
were so much of fallen on their sides.

1030
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:53,460
There was so much taller than I was. Um,
like it made me look like a dwarf by him,

1031
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:55,550
just enormous trees.

1032
01:01:55,970 --> 01:02:00,020
And literally the first trip she came on,

1033
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:04,880
which was only like
six months before that,

1034
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:08,900
like all those trees were there,
all those trees were there and it was,

1035
01:02:08,901 --> 01:02:13,901
and now we walk into it and it's probably
like 10 or 20 acres of trees that were

1036
01:02:14,691 --> 01:02:18,920
just leveled in that amount of time.
And the way that they were doing it.

1037
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:23,250
There wasn't by, these guys weren't using
the big chain saws and everything else.

1038
01:02:23,251 --> 01:02:26,310
They were just like going at it
with axes and stuff. And, uh,

1039
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,340
a lot of it actually isn't just
for the, the hardwoods. Um,

1040
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:33,450
I mean I would say that's
the majority of the problem.

1041
01:02:33,451 --> 01:02:35,330
But another big problem in,
in,

1042
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:40,340
in Congo or sub Sahara Africa is the
charcoal everyone uses for cooking.

1043
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:44,960
Um, they get it from these trees,
they cut them down, they throw, uh,

1044
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:48,150
they chop them up into little
bits and then they, they throw a,

1045
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:52,410
a big mounds of dirt over them and they
set them on fire and they smolder it for

1046
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:56,370
two, three weeks I think. And then
it comes out and he's kind of hard,

1047
01:02:56,371 --> 01:03:00,150
compressed a little
charcoal pieces. And, um,

1048
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:05,250
so then that's what they cook with
everywhere. And it's, uh, so that's,

1049
01:03:05,251 --> 01:03:07,320
that's another thing that,
that's a big issue.

1050
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,920
God, you know, there
was a photograph of a,

1051
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:14,820
a tree somewhere in California,
I forget where it was,

1052
01:03:14,821 --> 01:03:16,680
but one of the captions was this,

1053
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:21,770
this tree is somewhere in the neighborhood
of five to 600 years old or something

1054
01:03:23,161 --> 01:03:25,830
like that. It was like, they were
talking about like when this tree,

1055
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:29,700
what first came up,
Columbus was sailing. Wow.

1056
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:33,750
And this is a tree that you could see
today. I can, there's trees that are,

1057
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:38,120
I don't know what is the oldest tree?
I mean, how old are trainees? Not Been,

1058
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:41,310
I'm not, I'm not even sure, but
there's a tree somewhere. Yeah. I mean,

1059
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:45,390
in the Congo it's gotta be the oldest. I
mean, that's gotta be the oldest, right?

1060
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:50,280
Yeah. Probably when are up there.
It's a, it's, it's crazy. And then,

1061
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:54,920
and then there are times that the
trees, just the cycle of the forest, um,

1062
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:59,280
these trees can fall over.
Um, but, uh, like we,

1063
01:03:59,281 --> 01:04:01,920
we took a family of five to the hospital.

1064
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:06,020
Here's one right here with
Feisal Lauzen trees, 5,000 years.

1065
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:10,950
Bristol cone pine tree from California
White Mountains is thought to be almost

1066
01:04:10,951 --> 01:04:13,560
5,000 years old.
Goodness.

1067
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:17,400
The oldest non clonal tree in the world,

1068
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:21,390
the exact location of that Donald twisted
Methuselah is a forest service secret

1069
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:22,920
for its protection.

1070
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:27,170
Wow. Wow. That's insane. That's crazy man.

1071
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:32,240
I had no idea that could be 5,000 years
old and then some asshole can just come

1072
01:04:32,241 --> 01:04:34,650
along and just cut it down.
Make charcoal with it. Yeah.

1073
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:37,630
And some something nuts like, uh, I,

1074
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:42,800
I came in here and remember I had gotten
sick and I had to postpone on you.

1075
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,780
Um, and anyways, we went
to a hospital down in, uh,

1076
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:49,730
or up in Valencia I think.

1077
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:54,050
And they had thrown me in a room for
three hours and they were thinking about

1078
01:04:54,051 --> 01:04:55,850
getting Hazmat suits
out and all this stuff.

1079
01:04:55,851 --> 01:04:58,330
Cause I thought you might've had Ebola
cause he came back from Africa. Right,

1080
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:01,390
right, right after the Ebola
crisis. But it had been, um,

1081
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,900
I had been back for like two months or
something or maybe even close to three.

1082
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:10,580
And, uh, yeah, they were
going all crazy and stuff.

1083
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:16,100
And this is just a stat that, that I like
to, it's something that grips my heart,

1084
01:05:16,101 --> 01:05:18,010
so that's why I want say it now, but, um,

1085
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:22,420
me and I think I looked it up right
before he got in in here and it was around

1086
01:05:22,421 --> 01:05:27,040
11,000 people that a bullet took,
took out 11,000 people.

1087
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:29,800
That's a ton. It's a ton.
It's a brutal crisis.

1088
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:34,450
But I just remember the uproar that,
that and the fear,

1089
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:39,460
like the outcry that that
happened publicly all over
the United States and only

1090
01:05:39,461 --> 01:05:44,050
a couple people got it here and
then, and still, that's terrible.

1091
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:44,913
Um,

1092
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:49,810
but whenever I compare that 11,000
people total in this Ebola crisis,

1093
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:52,120
and then the stat for children,

1094
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:56,710
and this is on water for his website
and stuff and on ours and dude,

1095
01:05:56,711 --> 01:05:59,890
it's what I want to fight and let people
know because there should be a real

1096
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:04,180
public outcry and uproar.
That 5,000 kids,

1097
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:07,300
5,000 kids under the
age of five years old,

1098
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:09,970
die every single day,

1099
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:14,830
every single day because of dirty water,
because of water borne disease,

1100
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:16,210
because of waterborne illness.

1101
01:06:16,211 --> 01:06:20,740
That's a legit stat from like UNICEF
or one of those like legit places,

1102
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:24,040
5,000, 5,000 a day. It's like,

1103
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:28,390
it fluctuates from like 4,700
or something to 5,000 a day.

1104
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:32,470
And like for me, man, I've,
I've, I've held two of those
children. You know, I've,

1105
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:35,500
I've, I've dug the grave,
I've had blisters on my hands.

1106
01:06:35,501 --> 01:06:39,940
I've had a little dude named Andy
Bo's blood on my hands and like,

1107
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:43,930
like Bro, it's, it, it wrecks me.

1108
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:47,080
And like that's why I'm so
passionate about this thing. And like

1109
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:50,740
I come back and I get it.

1110
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:54,760
A bull is terrible and we need to knock
it out because it can take out so many

1111
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:59,080
people. But why? Why are people not like,

1112
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,760
why don't they have their eyes open?

1113
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:05,760
Their ears open their heart
open to hearing about 5,000
kids dying every day up

1114
01:07:06,041 --> 01:07:07,660
into the funeral of five other kids.

1115
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:10,270
I've seen the grave of nine
or 10 others besides that,

1116
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:13,780
like in these are just among the pygmies.
I've been to the,

1117
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:16,730
I've seen the funerals going on of
the, of their oppressors, like the,

1118
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:19,840
the slave masters and the Mokpala
the non pygmies that surround them.

1119
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:24,190
Their kids are dying of dirty
water and it's not, I don't,

1120
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:27,060
I don't mean to go crazy, but no,
it's not crazy at all. It's that,

1121
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:32,170
that statistic is crazy. 5,000 a day,
a day and they're under five years old.

1122
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:36,160
So I mean, I don't know how many with
the six, seven, eight, nine year olds,

1123
01:07:36,161 --> 01:07:39,370
you know, I've been to the funerals
of those kids. We are very strange.

1124
01:07:39,371 --> 01:07:40,360
But what we have,

1125
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:45,160
what we focused our attention on and the
Ebola thing is just something that was

1126
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:49,010
over here because we were worried about
it coming over here and we're doing this

1127
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:51,340
problem over here.
We were,

1128
01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:56,370
it's so convenient for people to not look
at impoverished third world countries,

1129
01:07:56,441 --> 01:07:59,950
people that are just, they've always
been in this sort of state of poverty,

1130
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:02,410
so we just sort of accept
them at being like that.

1131
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,960
We don't think that they necessarily,

1132
01:08:04,961 --> 01:08:09,590
that they have to live the way we live or
have access to clean water and medical.

1133
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:14,280
We just don't even think
about it. We worry about Cecil
the lion. Yeah. You know,

1134
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:18,920
this was the fun outrage about Cecil the
lion where everybody's going nuts and

1135
01:08:18,921 --> 01:08:22,220
freaking out. I mean, look,
poaching is terrible. It's awful.

1136
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:26,060
So the animals are beautiful.
It's an, you know, I get it,

1137
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:31,010
but the way we reacted to that,
to know your statistic,

1138
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,510
to know that what you just said,

1139
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:37,130
I had 5,000 little kids die every day
from dirty water and people aren't

1140
01:08:37,131 --> 01:08:41,630
freaking out about that. I think it's
like every 20 seconds. That's insane.

1141
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:45,170
I think it's every 20 sites really
hard to swallow. Yeah. And Bro,

1142
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:47,480
like wow,
that was,

1143
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:52,520
that was my 5,000 is
tuts w w that's so crazy.

1144
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:56,720
Just think about 5,000 dead bodies every
day and have them being little kids.

1145
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:00,580
I wow. And, and, and the thing that
really wrecked me with that was,

1146
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:03,980
so I spoke at this university in Oklahoma.
It's,

1147
01:09:03,981 --> 01:09:08,440
it's slipping my name or the name's
slipping me, but their students, um,

1148
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:12,950
is right when I got back from Congo and
they had heard about what I was doing.

1149
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:16,150
Um, I, he goes southern. Um,

1150
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:20,600
it's an Oklahoma City as
Smu. And uh, and they,

1151
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:24,800
they said, come, come speak
to our students. We want to,

1152
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:29,150
we want to try to raise enough for
a waterwheel. And um, and dude,

1153
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:31,370
they set out in their courtyard,

1154
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:36,230
they set out in their courtyard 5,000
white flags and this is a massive

1155
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,040
courtyard.

1156
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:41,780
They sent out 5,000 little white flags
and on it said the stat that's 5,000 kids

1157
01:09:41,781 --> 01:09:43,490
every day die of dirty water.

1158
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:48,140
And so I saw that right before I went
up and spoke and I went and solve the

1159
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:50,720
courtyard and it just wrecked
me because like for me,

1160
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:55,340
like the people that see that like
the stat can go in one year, it can,

1161
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,460
it can jack with you for a little bit.
It can mess with your mind,

1162
01:09:58,461 --> 01:10:00,540
it can mess with your heart.
Um,

1163
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:04,160
but it's so easy to go in one ear and
out the other at or once you sleep,

1164
01:10:04,161 --> 01:10:06,920
you know you're not going to wake up
thinking about that just from seeing those

1165
01:10:06,921 --> 01:10:10,610
white flags. And so like I grabbed
one of those white flags and I,

1166
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:14,510
and hopefully some of the people just
from seeing those flags, we'll get it.

1167
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:18,130
But like I had to write
Andy bow on the back and,

1168
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:20,600
and then when I got up and
spoke, I showed him, I'm like,

1169
01:10:20,601 --> 01:10:23,300
hey everyone of these white
flags, you see it, you saw it.

1170
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:25,220
Like it's a terrible statistic,
but this,

1171
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:29,270
the real statistic is that each and
every one of those flags has a name.

1172
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:33,110
Like it's a person, it's a
human being. It's a little kid.

1173
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:37,700
And like he didn't have to die of
dirty water. Not In today's age nine.

1174
01:10:37,701 --> 01:10:39,830
Today's age,
when we have the answer to the problem,

1175
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:43,930
when we know what we can do about
it and just people decide not to or,

1176
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:47,810
or like you said, make the uproar
about Cecil the lion. I mean,

1177
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:52,370
every American probably knows the name
Cecil the lion or at least 90% probably

1178
01:10:52,371 --> 01:10:53,600
do.
And like,

1179
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:57,620
I bet not even 10% not even 5% no.

1180
01:10:57,621 --> 01:11:01,080
That 5,000 kids every day are
dying just because of 31 time.

1181
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:05,390
Think it's 1% I didn't know it
was that many. That's nuts. Yeah.

1182
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:08,000
It's just, it's hard to
internalize those numbers too.

1183
01:11:08,001 --> 01:11:11,480
Even if you hear that number, it goes in
your head and it sort of bounces around.

1184
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:15,960
There's no, there's no point
of reference for me, man.

1185
01:11:15,961 --> 01:11:20,180
Like I absolutely 100% like,
so that was when I,

1186
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,380
I gave the chief Andy Bo's chief,
my,

1187
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:25,980
my first promise ever made the pygmies,
which was,

1188
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:32,270
was we had buried him and he had told us
that he was rejected hospital treatment

1189
01:11:33,211 --> 01:11:37,860
twice. Um, so he didn't just die
of waterborne disease, but, um,

1190
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,910
his, his other brother,
his father had died,

1191
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:45,330
waterborne disease and his mom was all
alone now and she couldn't even cry Bro.

1192
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:50,220
Whenever I, I met her, um, or one of her
eye, I saw her at this time, like she was,

1193
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:55,530
she was, she was topless and I could
see every single bone in her sternum,

1194
01:11:56,070 --> 01:12:00,780
like every single rib attached to her
sternum because she was so hungry and she

1195
01:12:00,781 --> 01:12:05,010
was so malnourished and she was so
thirsty. And so our team went and we got,

1196
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:09,480
we got mangos, passionfruit, um,
or mangoes and passion fruit juice,

1197
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:14,190
a rice and Tilapia.
And we brought it back and fed it to her.

1198
01:12:14,191 --> 01:12:18,000
And it wasn't maybe 10 minutes.
And I was wondering if she in shock,

1199
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:20,970
why should not crying?
I'm like,

1200
01:12:20,971 --> 01:12:25,080
why am I messed up from this so
much more than the mother? Um,

1201
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,450
and it was because she
was so malnourished,

1202
01:12:27,451 --> 01:12:31,710
she just didn't have the energy to
produce a tear over her son's death.

1203
01:12:31,711 --> 01:12:35,850
So she got the mango, she drank the
passion fruit juice. It wasn't 10,

1204
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:37,410
15 minutes later that thin,

1205
01:12:37,411 --> 01:12:41,940
she started sobbing because she had like
that sugar in that energy a little bit.

1206
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:45,850
And then after that, like due the
next day, it was so brutal. And um,

1207
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:49,260
I had blisters on my hand from digging
the grave and that's when the chief came

1208
01:12:49,261 --> 01:12:52,470
up and said, the first time we went and
got treatment, they told the mother,

1209
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:56,610
you're too dirty to come in
here. Um, and she said, well,

1210
01:12:56,611 --> 01:13:00,560
can you give them treatment? I know it's
just a pill or a shot. And they said,

1211
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:04,380
you have money. She said, I'm a slave. I
don't get paid the money. And they said,

1212
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:08,820
well, then go away. And then, and then
the second day, the whole village,

1213
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:11,840
and this is like 85 or a hundred people,
they,

1214
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:15,900
they grab everything
they can, which was, uh,

1215
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:19,980
like almost two dozen eggs.
They, they brought a chicken. Um,

1216
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:22,620
they brought a bag of charcoal.
Um,

1217
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:25,980
they brought firewood and then they
were able to beg because they don't make

1218
01:13:25,981 --> 01:13:29,370
money or these ones hadn't at this time.
And they,

1219
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:34,710
they were able to beg enough for three
and a half dollars worth of Congolese

1220
01:13:34,711 --> 01:13:38,940
franc and $3 was the treatment.
$3 was,

1221
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:42,470
were I think it was a dollar for the
pills that would have helped Andy Bo,

1222
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:45,000
they're probably too late
for the pills to work,

1223
01:13:45,001 --> 01:13:48,450
but maybe $3 for the shot,

1224
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:53,190
the injection that would help them
quicker. And it was something like $45.

1225
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:56,370
Um, it's in the book.
I got the real number,

1226
01:13:56,910 --> 01:14:01,910
$45 for his casket that I buried
them in. And, and it's just like,

1227
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:06,520
blew my mind that like the,
the oppressors, the people
that the Mokpala, the,

1228
01:14:06,521 --> 01:14:09,390
the non-Pygmies that surround
the pygmies were thinking like,

1229
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:14,980
these people are so worthless
or, or they're like animals
or whatever, that it's,

1230
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:19,180
it's easier for us to let them die or
cheaper for us to let them die than to

1231
01:14:19,181 --> 01:14:21,190
take care of them. And, um,

1232
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:25,950
and so that's when the chief grabbed me
and pulled me the side and said, Faa,

1233
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:30,310
which Fao? So, um, as my first pigmy
name, it means the man who loves us.

1234
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:35,890
And, um, he pulled me aside and said,
FAA, like, we don't have a voice.

1235
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:39,340
Nobody knows about our suffering.
Can you help tell people,

1236
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:40,630
can you be a voice for us?

1237
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:45,010
And that was when I said yes and no cause
I couldn't promise them clean water.

1238
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:46,810
I couldn't promise them land.

1239
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:48,790
I didn't know how all of
that stuff was going to go,

1240
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:51,910
but I knew that through him in May and
through like some of the other stuff,

1241
01:14:51,911 --> 01:14:53,620
like a platform that hey,
I can,

1242
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:56,710
I can at least help these people
have a voice of some sort.

1243
01:14:56,711 --> 01:15:00,860
Even if it's just with a hundred
people. Um, you know, maybe,

1244
01:15:00,861 --> 01:15:02,230
maybe I can help them have a voice.

1245
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:09,110
Two boy, Justin,

1246
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:12,620
sorry Broadway have you know, but
don't apologize at all. Thank you.

1247
01:15:13,190 --> 01:15:16,440
Thank you for thank you
for just being you, man.

1248
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:21,670
But that what you've experienced and
what you're talking about is so removed

1249
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:27,200
from almost everyone that lives here.

1250
01:15:27,201 --> 01:15:30,080
When we talk about poverty in America,

1251
01:15:30,081 --> 01:15:35,081
our poverty is almost ridiculous in
comparison to the poverty that they,

1252
01:15:35,571 --> 01:15:38,840
these people are experiencing, right?
What you're, where you're talking about.

1253
01:15:38,841 --> 01:15:42,920
It's just not even human.
I mean it's, it just, it's,

1254
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:48,040
it's so outside of the realm of our
imagination to even imagine living in a

1255
01:15:48,111 --> 01:15:53,111
world where someone won't give someone a
$3 shot or whatever it costs to treat a

1256
01:15:53,301 --> 01:15:55,460
baby is dying.

1257
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,610
And this woman can't even cry
because she doesn't have any food.

1258
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:02,480
She doesn't have enough energy for tears.
I can't,

1259
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,720
I can't imagine that world.

1260
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:10,990
And you continue to go back there to
try to help these people and now you are

1261
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:14,810
going to fight like not just,

1262
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:17,990
not just like try to build them wells,

1263
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:20,680
not just try to help them and
get them food. But now you are,

1264
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:26,630
you're going to fight in Bellator and
try to raise more awareness for this.

1265
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:33,810
What is it man?
You,

1266
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:38,540
you make this decision. You decide to
come back to America, your training, uh,

1267
01:16:38,570 --> 01:16:42,770
in Dallas, right? You're training a team
to take down where Johnny Hendricks,

1268
01:16:42,771 --> 01:16:47,060
former welterweight champion trains big,
giant modern facility,

1269
01:16:47,090 --> 01:16:48,560
one of the best places in the world.

1270
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:54,410
And you are preparing for this fight.
But your main goal,

1271
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,400
you love the sport,

1272
01:16:55,401 --> 01:17:00,230
but your main goal is to try to
bring awareness to the pygmies. Yeah,

1273
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:00,980
absolutely.

1274
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:05,980
So it's kind of a crazy way of around
about sort of a way of getting attention

1275
01:17:06,741 --> 01:17:09,980
to them. They'll get to compete
in a sport and arguably the

1276
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:13,550
most brutal sport in the world.
Yeah. Yeah. I think for me,

1277
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:15,110
I always thought I could only do,

1278
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:18,290
or for the last four years I'm
almost fight or flight. Yeah. Five.

1279
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:22,400
I thought I could only
do one or the other. Um,

1280
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:27,590
first and foremost, like the,
the my family and the people,

1281
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:31,010
they're like, I'm not ever
going to give that up and like,

1282
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:35,870
so it's worth it to me if I never had a
fight again, fine. So be it, you know,

1283
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:38,390
like, uh, that's okay with me. Um,

1284
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:43,160
so I was just so focused on that and
building the team and getting something

1285
01:17:43,161 --> 01:17:48,161
legitimately started that will
really impact them long term,

1286
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,350
not just a flash in the pan. And, um,

1287
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:56,630
but I saw fighting as something
that that is a platform.

1288
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:57,493
I mean, I'm, um,

1289
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:02,600
I'm here with you now just because I was
a fighter and then the other stuff that

1290
01:18:02,601 --> 01:18:05,450
came about,
but that's the link together.

1291
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:11,220
And so my wife's or talking to me and
other people start talking to me and kind

1292
01:18:11,221 --> 01:18:16,100
of said, well, what if he could do both?
And yeah, fighting the lifespan of it,

1293
01:18:16,101 --> 01:18:20,030
that's kind of like a flash in the pan.
It's just, it's a short, limited window.

1294
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:23,030
And um,
and the thing,

1295
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:27,830
the problem there is going to take life,
lifetime worth of dedication.

1296
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:29,150
And so what if,

1297
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,560
what if we're a season in my life
for it could just be a year or two,

1298
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:35,720
I'm planning on it being
five to seven years.

1299
01:18:35,721 --> 01:18:40,190
That way it can really make a run if
I can. Um, that's what I want to do.

1300
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:43,430
Um,
and what if that can set,

1301
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:46,800
set it up in a way that,

1302
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:51,620
that the longterm solution and
impact is bigger, better, greater,

1303
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:55,560
more sustainable. People
know about it more. Um,

1304
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:57,440
and people want to get involved.

1305
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:02,440
Like I think that it's hard kind of
living in the two different worlds going

1306
01:19:02,751 --> 01:19:07,040
back and forth. Um, because
they're so different. Um, I
kind of feel like I don't,

1307
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:10,610
like, I go there and I see what's
wrong and I'm like, oh, that's not,

1308
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:13,520
it shouldn't be like this, but I
come back here and I'm like, Huh,

1309
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:16,160
what's wrong here?
And it shouldn't be like this.

1310
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:20,600
And so I feel like I kind
of don't necessarily belong
in either one. And if I do,

1311
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:23,930
I belong more in the forest
with them because our, our,

1312
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:27,470
our hearts are so connected.
And so it's like culture shock here.

1313
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:30,710
And I don't get culture shock
there at all. Um, I love it.

1314
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:34,250
But what if you get culture shock when you
come back to America? Yeah, absolutely.

1315
01:19:34,251 --> 01:19:36,650
Man. Absolutely. From being in the Congo,

1316
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:42,510
the culture here messes with me.
Kardashians. That kind. Yeah, yeah,

1317
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:45,740
yeah, yeah. That, and uh,

1318
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:51,100
and I went to Popeye's right when I got
back and it was after I had buried Andy

1319
01:19:51,811 --> 01:19:56,630
bow and it was my second trip back coming
back and it was in like 2011, I think,

1320
01:19:56,631 --> 01:19:58,370
or maybe 2012.

1321
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,850
And I get back and I'm in a,

1322
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:07,290
I go straight to Popeye's and it's in
Atlanta and I walk inside and there's this

1323
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,570
mom and daughter and they're there with
a group that's going to do like some

1324
01:20:12,571 --> 01:20:14,820
kind of international aid in Haiti,

1325
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:19,440
Haiti shirts on and it wasn't too
long after the earthquake and stuff,

1326
01:20:19,441 --> 01:20:21,630
maybe like year and a half,
two years after.

1327
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:24,650
And the daughter is sitting
there and she's saying, uh,

1328
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:28,500
I'm going to get a coke and I'm waiting
behind them at the the coke machine.

1329
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:32,010
And so she starts filling up with
coke. Her mom goes, pour that out.

1330
01:20:32,011 --> 01:20:35,490
You're not going to have that. And she
goes, mom, they don't have coke in Haiti,

1331
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:40,320
which coax Congo coke's everywhere.
That was the first thing I wanted to say.

1332
01:20:40,321 --> 01:20:44,400
Like, Hey, there's door you guys.
There's coke there. Um, but,

1333
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:48,420
but right after that, like the mom's
like, if you drink that you're grounded.

1334
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:50,430
She goes, mom, you're going
to ground me over coke.

1335
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:54,900
And then they just went back and forth
bickering and then all of a sudden turned

1336
01:20:54,901 --> 01:20:57,840
into, you are grounded two
weeks when we get back.

1337
01:20:58,410 --> 01:21:03,090
Then all of a sudden the girl got
pissed, looked at her mom and said, mom,

1338
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:05,460
I hate you.
I hate you.

1339
01:21:05,461 --> 01:21:09,180
And she stormed out and this is at
the airport. They got their shirts on.

1340
01:21:09,181 --> 01:21:10,620
They haven't even gone on the trip yet.

1341
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:13,500
And I'm just thinking like I
wanted to grab, I'm not a mean way,

1342
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:18,000
but grab them and just say look,
love each other like you find over coke,

1343
01:21:18,001 --> 01:21:22,680
you're fine over sugar water.
Like stop like stop it.

1344
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:27,450
Like love each other like you're about
to get a rude awakening when you go to

1345
01:21:27,451 --> 01:21:27,751
Haiti.

1346
01:21:27,751 --> 01:21:30,840
And I've been there and I've seen the
people walking through snow drifts of

1347
01:21:30,841 --> 01:21:35,090
garbage to take a bath and walking back
out and having to climb up that snow

1348
01:21:35,091 --> 01:21:38,490
drift of garbage to get out
after they took their bath.

1349
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:42,090
And I've seen him digging
in the trash to find food.

1350
01:21:42,091 --> 01:21:44,400
I've seen kids sniffing
glue to fall asleep.

1351
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,710
Like I'm like you guys
are about to get wrecked.

1352
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:50,970
And like it wrecked me too cause I'm
like I just buried a kid over dirty water

1353
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:54,840
and now you guys are fighting
over sugar water. And so like,

1354
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:57,060
and I'm not like,
this is one thing,

1355
01:21:57,061 --> 01:22:00,570
I don't want to offend people in a way
of like saying our culture is terrible or

1356
01:22:00,571 --> 01:22:01,350
bad,

1357
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:05,820
but I want to point out certain things
that like life's bigger than our small

1358
01:22:05,821 --> 01:22:09,330
problems. And if we can get our eyes
off of those small problems and get,

1359
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,570
get her eyes onto the big picture,
like he'll do a lot of good,

1360
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:15,300
it'll change a lot of
things in our own own lives,

1361
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,900
our own hearts and our own relationships.
I think with people it's,

1362
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:22,710
it's just simply a matter of perspective.
And when we don't have real problems,

1363
01:22:22,711 --> 01:22:26,460
small problems become real problems.
Like this coke thing for this little girl.

1364
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:29,840
I mean it's probably, you know, it's,

1365
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:34,350
it's just a natural thing that human
beings do and some sort of a weird way.

1366
01:22:34,351 --> 01:22:37,830
We just lacked perspective if it's
not right in front of our face. Yeah.

1367
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:43,090
God, that's so crazy. Yeah. So I went
into a long story there, but uh, no,

1368
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:46,650
it's a great story and I can imagine
that means that would cause culture shock

1369
01:22:47,070 --> 01:22:50,970
for you. You, you must be just like
so baffled by it all. And I went,

1370
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:52,620
I went to one thing,

1371
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:58,280
water four has been an organization that
is like believed in us since the very

1372
01:22:58,861 --> 01:23:03,570
beginning. Kind of like you. Um,
whenever I'd come back and had seen,

1373
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:06,760
you know,
the two things but done anything yet,

1374
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,640
I hadn't like gotten land to
start a water. I didn't know,

1375
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:12,940
I just had the passion and the dream
and you put me on here and let me tell

1376
01:23:12,941 --> 01:23:17,770
people that water for Kinda
did the same thing. And um, uh,

1377
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:22,150
they, they gave me the tools when I hadn't
done the training and knowledge when I

1378
01:23:22,151 --> 01:23:24,580
didn't know anything
and just got behind me.

1379
01:23:24,581 --> 01:23:28,930
But I got back in three days
later I was at their gala and um,

1380
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:31,810
and uh,
and it was awesome.

1381
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:35,890
It was a great event and me and I was
crying cause they did a video of me and

1382
01:23:35,891 --> 01:23:40,690
the Congo and um, then I had to get
up and speak and it was real tough.

1383
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:43,150
But I, I, I go right from
there in three days later,

1384
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:46,140
I met kind of like a black tie event.
Um,

1385
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:50,080
and women are wearing fur
and all this stuff and uh,

1386
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:53,950
and so it was just was like,
Whoa, from one world to the other.

1387
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:58,920
But I see it as a way to,
um, like there they do,

1388
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:02,560
they did so much that
night for this project,

1389
01:24:02,561 --> 01:24:05,860
for the people,
for their families,

1390
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:09,700
with their furs and their
Tuxedos. Wow. But yeah,

1391
01:24:09,701 --> 01:24:12,370
the honestly though they were people
with hearts in the right place.

1392
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:15,370
And I get it. It's just cultures are
different. We live different. We,

1393
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:18,280
and so I don't want people
run around here and you know,

1394
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:21,550
leafs and stuff like that.
I don't want them sleeping on the ground.

1395
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:25,810
You don't want anybody doing
yeah, no, no, not at all. But uh,

1396
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:31,270
but it's been cool me and like the,
the water for thing latte for you,

1397
01:24:31,271 --> 01:24:36,271
like fight for the forgotten has gone
into a dormant stage and our nonprofit and

1398
01:24:37,271 --> 01:24:41,710
we have officially partnered with water
four, we joined forces with them. Um,

1399
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,920
because when it comes to like
the reporting the business,

1400
01:24:44,921 --> 01:24:48,140
I think it was even the
logistics and the training, uh,

1401
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:51,010
their water engineers are hydrologists
that different kinds of things that they

1402
01:24:51,011 --> 01:24:55,210
can add to us are so great. Um, they've,

1403
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:58,600
they've given us a truck, all
the tools, all the training.

1404
01:24:58,601 --> 01:25:03,490
They've really been a huge
like component behind us.

1405
01:25:03,491 --> 01:25:07,120
But one of the things I love
most about them is, uh, is yeah,

1406
01:25:07,121 --> 01:25:10,570
we're partnering in a way that,
that, how would I explain it?

1407
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:15,550
We see eye to eye on something
like the owner. I mean the founder,

1408
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:19,600
he says, water four isn't about
charity. It's about opportunity.

1409
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:24,280
And like, dude, I love that
because when you just do charity,

1410
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:27,880
like you just help as for
such a short amount of time.

1411
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:30,040
But the waterfall method is like,
hey,

1412
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:33,250
we're going to put the tools in
their hands that are the, the,

1413
01:25:33,251 --> 01:25:35,500
the knowledge in their heads.
Um,

1414
01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:39,400
and then we're going to look to create
an opportunity for them that goes beyond

1415
01:25:39,401 --> 01:25:43,750
what we can do from the West
or from our short term mission,

1416
01:25:43,751 --> 01:25:45,890
humanitarian trip.
Um,

1417
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:49,210
we want to give this
thing a life of its own,

1418
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:54,340
that it becomes a breathing, living
thing. We're even a business, you know,

1419
01:25:54,341 --> 01:25:57,160
like there's there in 31
different countries in there.

1420
01:25:57,450 --> 01:26:01,390
They're helping these
entrepreneurs do social good.

1421
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:04,260
Like they get paid to
drill water wells and,

1422
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:07,480
and to train nationals and the
jobs don't have to go outside.

1423
01:26:07,481 --> 01:26:11,120
They can stay inside the
house. And so I've just, I've,

1424
01:26:11,121 --> 01:26:12,400
I've loved that about him in,

1425
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:17,150
and the cool thing that I love is that
it's not about us being the heroes.

1426
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:22,010
It's about, it's about the,
the locals being the heroes.
Like I, that's the thing.

1427
01:26:22,011 --> 01:26:25,570
I don't want to be the hero
of this. I want to be, uh,

1428
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:30,500
a spark plug, if that makes sense in
the engine. I want to get it started,

1429
01:26:30,501 --> 01:26:35,120
get it running.
But the people are the strength,

1430
01:26:35,121 --> 01:26:39,300
that engine, the thing that makes it
run a spark plug gets it started. But,

1431
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:41,750
but the locals and investing in them,

1432
01:26:41,751 --> 01:26:45,440
telling them you can do it
fly on your own wings like a,

1433
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:48,440
you just need the training. You just need
the knowledge. You just need the tools.

1434
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:52,220
Once you have that, you're golden,
you know, do this for yourself.

1435
01:26:52,221 --> 01:26:53,540
Once they have fresh water though,

1436
01:26:53,570 --> 01:26:56,090
there's still going to be the issue
of food though, right? I mean,

1437
01:26:56,091 --> 01:26:59,270
it seems like with the logging, you're
saying that it's more difficult to hunt.

1438
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:01,850
Yeah. So what, what
we've been doing is, uh,

1439
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:04,970
we're interning the three agriculturalist
right now and we're about to hire him.

1440
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:09,740
It's awesome. I'm so pumped. Um, put
the guy that did the 3,500 trees,

1441
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:12,740
uh,
he's great at farming.

1442
01:27:12,741 --> 01:27:16,640
And so in three of the villages we wanted
to kind of start it on a smaller scale

1443
01:27:16,641 --> 01:27:20,580
first. Um, because it is
land, water and food, and we,

1444
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:22,020
there's kind of a process to it.
You know,

1445
01:27:22,021 --> 01:27:24,470
you can't start growing food or
having a water without the land.

1446
01:27:24,471 --> 01:27:26,750
And then first you need,
I mean,

1447
01:27:26,751 --> 01:27:29,990
you can't live without water for
more than three days, I think. Right.

1448
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:31,790
Or at least some of it. And, uh,

1449
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:35,780
then food he can live for like
three weeks without, um, and so,

1450
01:27:35,781 --> 01:27:37,220
or something like that. And, uh,

1451
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:41,130
so with the food we started
in three different areas, um,

1452
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:42,590
three different villages once tuned to,

1453
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:45,950
and they're the ones sankeys
grandfather Leon May.

1454
01:27:46,070 --> 01:27:48,140
He's one of the most
brilliant men I've ever met.

1455
01:27:48,770 --> 01:27:52,760
Like maybe he's never gone
to school, maybe, but,

1456
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:57,850
but I promise like the dude is just a
problem solver and he inspires his people

1457
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:03,020
to get her like the whole village to
get around the vision and let's do this.

1458
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:05,600
And so we basically said,
start with what you have.

1459
01:28:05,930 --> 01:28:09,260
That's kind of the waterfall method
to, um, start with what you have.

1460
01:28:09,261 --> 01:28:11,510
And we're going to come and we're
going to, we're going to fuel it.

1461
01:28:11,511 --> 01:28:15,350
We want to empower you to be able
to do it for yourself. Um, and,

1462
01:28:15,370 --> 01:28:19,760
and that's all people need. They need
to look a little jumpstart. And so, uh,

1463
01:28:20,450 --> 01:28:22,610
so anyways,
in this village and just Liam Hayes,

1464
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:25,340
I wish I would have brought in
the list of what it is. But, uh,

1465
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:31,070
from the time I came back and got married
and went back about 10 weeks ago, um,

1466
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:36,890
uh, I got to celebrate the 20th water.
Well, that was Doug and drilled.

1467
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:40,040
Um,
and it was such an awesome celebration.

1468
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:45,460
But one of the most exciting things
to me was that I walk into tune to,

1469
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:51,350
and at first I was like, like
no way. How is this happening?

1470
01:28:51,351 --> 01:28:56,000
Like all of a sudden I was walking
through a forest of, of, of bananas,

1471
01:28:56,120 --> 01:29:00,830
like, uh, and, and, and they had
planted on their own. We had helped to,

1472
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:04,170
um, we, we help when we can and
we want to help so much more.

1473
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:08,010
But they had planted over
250 banana trees out there,

1474
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:10,620
over 250 surrounding their village.

1475
01:29:11,790 --> 01:29:16,020
They had done a corn hole hole filled,
huge field of corn,

1476
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:20,700
cassava, which is kind of like a, a
spinach type tastes, kind of like spinach.

1477
01:29:21,250 --> 01:29:25,260
They make SOM bay out of it.
Um, they had done potatoes,

1478
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:30,420
sweet potatoes, peanuts, a
mere Cujo or a passion fruit.

1479
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:34,770
Um, and yams, that's eight.

1480
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:39,360
I think the list might have nine or 10,
but uh, but they had done that all from,

1481
01:29:39,361 --> 01:29:43,830
hey, if we get you your own land, do
you think we could help you with water?

1482
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:45,780
And you could help us with the labor.

1483
01:29:45,781 --> 01:29:48,510
Some of it like taking the
tools inside the village.

1484
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:51,720
Like they love that they come
and help us. Then it's like, hey,

1485
01:29:51,990 --> 01:29:55,470
we want to get a farming project started.
Can we empower you to do that?

1486
01:29:55,471 --> 01:29:57,360
We gave them some tools,
we gave them some seeds,

1487
01:29:57,361 --> 01:30:01,890
we gave them some banana trees and
they just ran with it, man. And so, um,

1488
01:30:02,910 --> 01:30:03,630
I dunno,
I just,

1489
01:30:03,630 --> 01:30:08,040
I just love seeing that if you empower
someone instead of treat them like a

1490
01:30:08,041 --> 01:30:08,910
charity case,

1491
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:13,650
if you give them an opportunity instead
of saying you can't do this for yourself,

1492
01:30:13,651 --> 01:30:15,320
get out of the way, I'll
do it for you. Well,

1493
01:30:15,321 --> 01:30:18,360
it's definitely a much more intelligent
approach and it's definitely better for

1494
01:30:18,361 --> 01:30:23,310
them and the future for now. Uh, it
gives them that feeling of empowerment,

1495
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:24,120
the feeling that they're,

1496
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:27,360
they're improving and that their life is
getting better because of their efforts,

1497
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:28,440
almost dignity.

1498
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:32,010
It gives them something to be proud of
instead of something to be sad about.

1499
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:35,500
Like, oh, I can't do this for
myself. Oh, I can do it. You know,

1500
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:37,950
that's got to be cool for you
to say, Yo Dude, I love it.

1501
01:30:38,230 --> 01:30:42,710
And one of the other villages, um,
that we call it [inaudible]. Uh,

1502
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:46,080
and it's, uh, anyways, it was,

1503
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:50,340
I at first my heart sank because
they really love their, uh,

1504
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,460
in nine of the 10 villages,
they really love their huts. Uh,

1505
01:30:53,470 --> 01:30:56,910
it's very culturally important to
them, the twigs and leaves. Um,

1506
01:30:57,420 --> 01:31:00,480
but whenever I walk in on onto their land,

1507
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:03,720
all of a sudden I saw huts that
were just like the Mokpala,

1508
01:31:03,721 --> 01:31:06,780
just like the non pygmies. It was
the mud huts that were, I don't know,

1509
01:31:06,781 --> 01:31:11,250
four to six inches thick walls.
They had the leafed roofs. Um, but,

1510
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:15,870
but there were much stronger houses
and all of a sudden I'd, I'd come back,

1511
01:31:15,871 --> 01:31:18,450
I'd gone back and then all
of a sudden to that village,

1512
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:22,110
what was important to them? The
other one, the farming and yes,

1513
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:25,590
this village also Melendez started
farming for themselves as well,

1514
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:26,723
corn and beans.

1515
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:31,770
But they started doing the huts
because they were like, hey,

1516
01:31:31,771 --> 01:31:34,650
if we're really equal now
we're equal to our neighbors,

1517
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:37,290
then we can live in the same
kind of houses that they have.

1518
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:41,500
We can stay out of the rain better. We
can keep our kids warmer at night. Um,

1519
01:31:41,530 --> 01:31:42,361
and so to them,

1520
01:31:42,361 --> 01:31:46,740
what was a value to them was one of
the reasons they get called animals.

1521
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:48,630
Um, and, and,

1522
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:52,470
and subhuman and other things is
because of their twigging leaflets.

1523
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:55,740
And their neighbors will say
they live just like animals.

1524
01:31:55,960 --> 01:32:00,100
They live in a nest or a, we're
different. Things like that.

1525
01:32:00,101 --> 01:32:02,690
Well now this displaces a,

1526
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:05,290
now they have houses just like
the others were equals now,

1527
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:10,030
like that's kind of their, their
motto, like we're equals now. And uh,

1528
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:11,890
so that blew me away.
At first my heart sunk.

1529
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:13,540
Then all of a sudden they
told me they're proud.

1530
01:32:13,541 --> 01:32:17,140
They walked me into every single digit.
Why'd you heart sank? Because I thought,

1531
01:32:17,141 --> 01:32:21,160
I thought they maybe had had
gotten pushed off their land. Uh,

1532
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:26,560
the muck Paula had taken the land back
in and we have strict agreements and

1533
01:32:26,561 --> 01:32:31,510
paperwork and like stamped in the
courts and law, uh, that, that hey,

1534
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:35,920
this is the agreement that is going to
be a peaceful way of doing this and we're

1535
01:32:35,921 --> 01:32:39,130
going to help the community
come up together. So it'd be,

1536
01:32:39,131 --> 01:32:42,860
it'd be dumb of us to go in and say, we're
just gonna help the pygmies. So we, we,

1537
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:44,850
we,
we helped the community altogether.

1538
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:48,310
I thought these guys had gone back on
their word, but then all sudden it was,

1539
01:32:48,311 --> 01:32:50,140
whoa, they're living just
like everybody else. No.

1540
01:32:50,530 --> 01:32:54,730
These people have any idea
of the impact of your work.

1541
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:59,140
Like did they understand like
that you could reach, I mean,

1542
01:32:59,141 --> 01:33:02,680
you're probably going to a million plus
people are going to hear this podcast,

1543
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:06,820
the impact that you're going to have
when they talk about it on spike TV

1544
01:33:06,821 --> 01:33:09,010
probably just as much.
I mean,

1545
01:33:09,011 --> 01:33:11,050
I dunno what the number of
spikes been getting for fights,

1546
01:33:11,051 --> 01:33:13,290
but it's gotta be probably close
to a million or at least, yeah,

1547
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:17,410
I think it's over it. There's a lot of
fucking people that are going to be,

1548
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:21,100
did they understand that? Do they
have this idea of who you are? Um,

1549
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:26,920
they know me as Fal sa
[inaudible] that's my name.

1550
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:31,570
D till like, like to try
to interrupt you, but no,

1551
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:36,010
you're fine to you or to me. Okay.
Like you tell me that 5,000 people,

1552
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:39,460
5,000 children die every day
because of lack of water.

1553
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:44,200
I can't get that in my hat. I mean,
I know I, I'm trying and uh, it's,

1554
01:33:44,201 --> 01:33:47,450
I know it's horrific, but I mean,
my head is like, what? Look this,

1555
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:49,480
so it's almost like
there's no place for it.

1556
01:33:49,481 --> 01:33:52,030
It's like it's moving around in
my head it doesn't, there's no,

1557
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:54,670
but you told me your grandfather
died. I'm like, fuck man,

1558
01:33:54,671 --> 01:33:58,150
dude lost his grandfather. You know what
I'm saying? Like it fits. It makes sense.

1559
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:02,740
You tell me 5,000 kids die every day
because of a lack of water and I'm just

1560
01:34:02,741 --> 01:34:05,560
blank. It's like I'm trying
to find a place for it.

1561
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:10,120
When you tell them that you are going to
fight on spike TV and they're going to

1562
01:34:10,121 --> 01:34:15,100
show a video of why you're doing this and
I'm going to show a profile on you and

1563
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:18,280
they understand what you do. Do they, do,

1564
01:34:18,281 --> 01:34:22,270
they understand these people are gonna
see you. Did they ever see you fight?

1565
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:26,920
If they seen a video of you, they've seen
a Topps card, a Topps card, that's it.

1566
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:28,840
Tufts card.
Do they know what you do?

1567
01:34:28,841 --> 01:34:33,040
Do they know that you were on the ultimate
fighter? Do they know about the UFC?

1568
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:37,770
They understand. My drilling team does
the, the well drilling team, right?

1569
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:41,240
And sometimes we'd put on
little entertaining things, uh,

1570
01:34:41,650 --> 01:34:43,180
where the pygmies would come around.

1571
01:34:43,181 --> 01:34:45,130
And I'm not going to wrestle
one of those guys, but uh,

1572
01:34:45,190 --> 01:34:47,710
but I'll wrestle some of
our well drillers. There's
one guy that's at least six,

1573
01:34:47,711 --> 01:34:49,540
five on our team.
And so I'm,

1574
01:34:49,630 --> 01:34:53,200
I'm wrestling with them and throwing them
around a little bit. And I think, uh,

1575
01:34:53,230 --> 01:34:57,440
Ben will tell them sometimes that, you
know, hey, in the United States he was a,

1576
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:58,190
he was a wrestler,

1577
01:34:58,190 --> 01:35:01,640
he was a fighter. And people know
who he is. But for them, the,

1578
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:04,310
for a frame of reference,
kind of like you're saying,

1579
01:35:04,311 --> 01:35:07,100
you don't have the frame of reference
for 5,000 kids dying every day.

1580
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:10,730
I don't think they really
have a reference for, um,

1581
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,800
for professional sports television.
Like,

1582
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:17,810
and I've never met a bootie pygmy that has
a cell phone, um, that has electricity.

1583
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:19,040
Uh,

1584
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:22,550
I've met someone with a flashlight or a
couple of guys with a flashlight that's

1585
01:35:22,551 --> 01:35:27,110
like the cool dude. Yeah,
absolutely. So, uh, and,

1586
01:35:27,111 --> 01:35:27,590
and we've,

1587
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:31,010
we've left behind some of the cheaper
like radios and they can get like two

1588
01:35:31,011 --> 01:35:35,930
stations or one. Um, and uh,
but, but for them, like, I mean,

1589
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:39,920
soccer, I don't even think they really
know that that's a professional sport.

1590
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:40,671
Maybe they do,

1591
01:35:40,671 --> 01:35:43,610
but they don't have a reference because
they don't know any of the players.

1592
01:35:43,610 --> 01:35:46,550
They don't watch any of the games,
like they know kick a ball around.

1593
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,240
And a lot of times it's just in
a big circle. Um, but there's,

1594
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:53,870
I shouldn't not misspeak because
there's a couple places that, um,

1595
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:57,890
with the Mokpala, they have like
some, some teams and have some, uh,

1596
01:35:58,130 --> 01:36:01,670
some fields and stuff. But that's only
like two of the places. Other than that,

1597
01:36:01,671 --> 01:36:04,310
it's just a circle and you
kicked the ball around. So no,

1598
01:36:04,311 --> 01:36:08,330
I wouldn't say that they,
they have a reference for what,

1599
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:12,320
what I'm trying to do for them. But
like, that's not what it's about for me.

1600
01:36:12,550 --> 01:36:16,990
No, I know it's not about that for
you, but for them it's gotta be so odd.

1601
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:21,960
This guy, the first white person they've
ever seen, and there's a video of you, uh,

1602
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:27,000
that was going around reddit long time
ago of you meeting them and them touching

1603
01:36:27,551 --> 01:36:29,440
you. And I can't believe you're
white and they're freaking out.

1604
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:32,860
But this guy who shows up out of nowhere,

1605
01:36:32,890 --> 01:36:35,440
like a mythical creature mean if you,

1606
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:37,470
if, if, if

1607
01:36:37,930 --> 01:36:42,790
no one else could ever reach them, and
if, if you stopped going there, and if,

1608
01:36:42,791 --> 01:36:46,630
uh, if all contact with
the outside world ceased,

1609
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:51,130
you would be like a part of their
religion. I mean, do you understand that?

1610
01:36:51,131 --> 01:36:55,300
You'd be like some Jesus Christ type
character that comes out of nowhere. Some,

1611
01:36:55,960 --> 01:37:00,280
some magical man from another world
who shows them how to get water,

1612
01:37:00,281 --> 01:37:03,070
loves them and cares for them.
Here's a video of you,

1613
01:37:03,430 --> 01:37:05,530
whether they're grabbing
you and touching you.

1614
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:10,040
And that's a actually the Mokpala, uh,
that's the non pygmy kiddos. So their,

1615
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:14,450
their parents, uh, most of them
were kind of the slave masters.

1616
01:37:14,451 --> 01:37:19,451
And even even from that village where
the reason Andy Bo was denied hospital

1617
01:37:20,601 --> 01:37:22,700
treatment. So, but,

1618
01:37:22,730 --> 01:37:26,990
but really like I believe this
was a moment used in my life,

1619
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:28,220
especially how it blew up.

1620
01:37:28,230 --> 01:37:31,700
I just put it up for a couple
of my friends to look at
and it had like literally

1621
01:37:31,701 --> 01:37:35,870
40 views before all of a sudden it went
viral and it was up for like four months,

1622
01:37:36,170 --> 01:37:38,470
three months, four months. Um,

1623
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:42,390
but now look at their beautiful
smiles now, right? Yeah. On,

1624
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:44,930
on Youtube it's 1.8,
I think,

1625
01:37:44,931 --> 01:37:48,770
but on Facebook a bunch of people ripped
it and posted it and it was over 12

1626
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:51,830
million. Um, so 12 million on Facebook.

1627
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:55,920
You literally are like a
religious character. I mean,

1628
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:56,813
I don't know about that.

1629
01:37:57,450 --> 01:38:01,890
I know you don't know about that cause
you're humble and you're not looking at

1630
01:38:01,891 --> 01:38:02,431
it like that.

1631
01:38:02,431 --> 01:38:07,431
But just the sheer
perspective like for them to,

1632
01:38:08,410 --> 01:38:10,140
to be living in that world.

1633
01:38:10,310 --> 01:38:14,670
Where are their number one concern
is feeding themselves parasites,

1634
01:38:14,730 --> 01:38:18,130
trying to get some clean water.
And some guy comes from a,

1635
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:23,400
a place on the other side of the planet
and this guy does this thing called

1636
01:38:24,510 --> 01:38:29,310
mixed martial arts and he fights
and they broadcasted on television,

1637
01:38:29,311 --> 01:38:33,090
something they've never seen before in
their life. They've never seen a video.

1638
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:36,850
They have no idea what MMA is. They
have no idea the impact. Right.

1639
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:41,390
And then you're going on podcasts and
talking about it and you have websites to,

1640
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:46,230
to help people contribute. I
mean, this is a to them, I mean,

1641
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:49,560
I can't imagine that they would
understand what this is, is

1642
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:53,010
wanting them rubbing your head. Yeah.
They're going crazy robbing your hair.

1643
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:55,740
They're doing my bearded men
again. But uh, it's so funny too,

1644
01:38:55,741 --> 01:38:58,700
countries when you backed up, when you
look there all right. Back Up. Yeah.

1645
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:02,880
He's standing up straight. Runaway. Right.
Like they didn't know what to do with.

1646
01:39:02,910 --> 01:39:07,110
Yeah. Well I've gone into some
villages before and literally they,

1647
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:09,750
the women grabbed their
children and dive into the huts.

1648
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:12,920
The men run and hide behind trees,
um,

1649
01:39:13,150 --> 01:39:17,220
and grabbed their bows and arrows
and spears and gone. And uh,

1650
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:20,670
and it's funny cause in those cases
it's only happened a few times,

1651
01:39:20,730 --> 01:39:24,690
like three or four times. I'm actually
pretty much every new village,

1652
01:39:24,691 --> 01:39:28,010
so maybe 10 times. But uh,
but whenever I go in a,

1653
01:39:28,590 --> 01:39:32,640
it's funny cause it's normally the women
that are the brave ones that come up to

1654
01:39:32,641 --> 01:39:37,430
me first and then and then touch
my arm or touched my, my, yeah,

1655
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:40,560
it just,
I've heard once before it was because uh,

1656
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:43,920
yeah I'm the first white guy
they were seeing or is he real?

1657
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:47,000
Cause we didn't give this village of a
heads up that we were coming or that how

1658
01:39:47,001 --> 01:39:50,670
was comparable. Snowman is on the
way. And one time they were like,

1659
01:39:50,671 --> 01:39:55,170
is that a lion man? Um, another one
was like a, is that, is that a spirit?

1660
01:39:55,350 --> 01:39:57,170
Is that like a ghost guy?

1661
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:02,010
I'm telling you it and you're
like an alien I, yeah. Well,

1662
01:40:02,011 --> 01:40:02,880
and then look at me dude.

1663
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:08,460
It's crazy wild looking guy here with all
this hair and then there I just let it

1664
01:40:08,461 --> 01:40:08,971
go wild.

1665
01:40:08,971 --> 01:40:13,890
And so it's so strange with the
pygmies and the Mokpala that's there.

1666
01:40:14,130 --> 01:40:16,360
Most of them even are well drilling team.
Uh,

1667
01:40:16,530 --> 01:40:20,820
everyone is fascinated with my body here,
the arm here because,

1668
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:24,240
because they don't have arm here or like
here and then I'm just covered in it.

1669
01:40:24,590 --> 01:40:27,480
So they'd be going through some kind
of a white gorilla or something.

1670
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:33,270
My buddies would call me like great
white Sasquatch or the vanilla gorilla.

1671
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:34,830
That's so strange.

1672
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:39,100
Just can't imagine how
odd it must be to them.

1673
01:40:39,310 --> 01:40:42,010
And they don't even
really know how odd it is.

1674
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:46,270
Like for them to not have the
preference of television not understand,

1675
01:40:46,630 --> 01:40:48,540
like if you could take them,
give me,

1676
01:40:48,550 --> 01:40:51,520
I mean if spike TV wants
to really make an impact,

1677
01:40:51,700 --> 01:40:54,070
what the need to do is go to the,
take some of those

1678
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:57,460
little fellows and fly them
out to your fight. Yeah.

1679
01:40:57,490 --> 01:41:00,130
That was the fucking nuts man with think.

1680
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:03,870
What would they think that
a grocery store, I wonder
what they think us using it.

1681
01:41:04,030 --> 01:41:08,350
I always thought using a credit card
cause for that transaction transaction it

1682
01:41:08,351 --> 01:41:09,810
looks like they give it right back to you.
Yeah.

1683
01:41:10,510 --> 01:41:14,220
So it's like you get all this food,
you give the cashier, uh, the,

1684
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:15,970
the card they smile at,

1685
01:41:15,971 --> 01:41:18,410
you give it back and then you need to
take all the food out. It's like food.

1686
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:20,520
You think it's very here, right. Um,

1687
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:24,430
trying to get them to understand what
the Internet is. Yeah. Or the moving,

1688
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:26,940
moving sidewalks at the airport.
Uh,

1689
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:31,510
how about fucking time square
in New York City or Vegas? Yeah,

1690
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:33,640
sometimes I think about it and
I think it would be awesome.

1691
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:37,060
Other times I think about it and I
think it would be torture. I don't know.

1692
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:38,590
I mean maybe that sounds crazy,

1693
01:41:38,591 --> 01:41:43,591
but also like giving them a place where
all of a sudden they have everything at

1694
01:41:45,071 --> 01:41:49,360
their fingertips and take him into
a grocery store and then they, they,

1695
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:50,830
they miss their family right away,

1696
01:41:50,831 --> 01:41:54,250
taking them out to go to a Benjamin
or Lorraine goes wedding. Uh,

1697
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:58,870
they started missing the forest, like
deeply missing their friends and family,

1698
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:01,180
deeply missing.
I've never seen it before.

1699
01:42:01,181 --> 01:42:03,630
Getting so homesick for something
in two or three days. Well,

1700
01:42:03,631 --> 01:42:06,330
I can only imagine this bond
because they're their struggles.

1701
01:42:06,340 --> 01:42:09,790
So it's so different than the stay alive.
And then when they were with us,

1702
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:11,770
they had,
they had the food everywhere.

1703
01:42:11,771 --> 01:42:14,380
Like we're cooking the meals for him and
everything when they came to the town.

1704
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:18,250
And I took a,
as names kept Tula and uh,

1705
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:22,690
he's on the video that's on, on
Kickstarter launched today. But, um,

1706
01:42:23,650 --> 01:42:27,850
uh, he passed away recently
and a mess me up. But, um,

1707
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:31,540
he's one of my favorite
dudes. And, um, anyways,

1708
01:42:31,541 --> 01:42:35,350
I took him to the hospital
like seven times. And um,

1709
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:40,250
what is this, Jamie, what are you putting
up? This is the Kickstarter. And how do,

1710
01:42:40,330 --> 01:42:42,200
how does someone get to this?
Uh,

1711
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:45,550
it's kickstarter.com and then it's
fighting for freedom. It's a new,

1712
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:48,890
it's going to be a documentary. We want
to tell the story. I don't know if,

1713
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,500
if we got five minutes. Yeah,
yeah, sure. Play it, play it.

1714
01:42:52,510 --> 01:42:56,680
We could do it with the
volume. Yeah. In my American
bubble. Can we, can we restart?

1715
01:42:56,730 --> 01:42:57,563
Yeah.

1716
01:42:57,710 --> 01:42:58,543
Okay.

1717
01:42:59,490 --> 01:43:02,650
There are two people groups in
the rain forest. The muck, Paula

1718
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:07,720
meaning non pygmies and pick the pygmies
are the muck palace leaves Java or the

1719
01:43:08,331 --> 01:43:12,890
forests or exist. Now that was a draw
day. It's not just a thing of the past.

1720
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:16,790
I mean that's what I thought. You
know, living in my American bubble,

1721
01:43:17,190 --> 01:43:18,920
you know there's no slaves today.

1722
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:24,260
You got rid of that in the 18
hundreds slavery in today's age,

1723
01:43:25,010 --> 01:43:25,843
why

1724
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:34,470
community's torn or four
different generations that
their cost monkeys or jungle

1725
01:43:34,471 --> 01:43:37,110
people tell us we are nothing

1726
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,230
after that, their costs,
nothing. If he called me later,

1727
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:48,250
yeah I create us or are
we human [inaudible] their
slave masters and come up to

1728
01:43:49,261 --> 01:43:49,980
me and say,

1729
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:54,680
what are you doing with my animals or
what are you here doing with my property?

1730
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:55,970
I own these people

1731
01:43:59,260 --> 01:44:03,810
work hard from morning until night and
we would get paid in two bananas to share

1732
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:08,710
two bananas. They definitely need to
be given a few fish, a few bananas,

1733
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:13,030
something small so that they can come
back and work the next day so that they're

1734
01:44:13,090 --> 01:44:15,790
hungry, not at the half to come
back and work the next day.

1735
01:44:19,470 --> 01:44:24,010
So I create us. We're human.

1736
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:27,530
We have to fight this.
People are worth sightings.

1737
01:44:34,230 --> 01:44:36,390
My name is Justin wren,
13 years old.

1738
01:44:36,391 --> 01:44:38,670
I want to be a UFC fighter or
surf fighting professionally.

1739
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:42,810
In 19 years old was on a reality TV show
called the ultimate fighter when I was

1740
01:44:42,811 --> 01:44:47,811
21 this main event at the hard rock in
Las Vegas when I was 23 and that was what

1741
01:44:50,371 --> 01:44:52,350
I always thought it was going to be.
My significance,

1742
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:56,130
my purpose was the champion fighter.

1743
01:44:56,131 --> 01:44:59,720
If I could be that since then
have to come here to Congo.

1744
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:05,360
Why should the sweet,
loving,

1745
01:45:05,361 --> 01:45:10,361
amazing people literally thought of and
believe to be animals whenever there are

1746
01:45:11,451 --> 01:45:16,280
these sweet, loving, amazing people.
So if there's something we can do,

1747
01:45:16,281 --> 01:45:17,700
if there's something I can do,
I'm going to do it.

1748
01:45:20,150 --> 01:45:21,800
I was fighting against people,

1749
01:45:21,801 --> 01:45:23,560
but really I was just supposed
to be fighting for repeal.

1750
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:27,950
And even whenever we feel like the
last ounce of strength is leaving,

1751
01:45:28,490 --> 01:45:31,960
we still got to choose to fight and we'll,
we'll see something amazing happened.

1752
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:38,220
I've seen people set free bro.
I've seen people set free.

1753
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:44,890
My name is Derek Watson
and I'm a filmmaker.

1754
01:45:44,980 --> 01:45:48,790
And this story has
dramatically changed my life.

1755
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:54,060
What inspires me about Justin is here's
a guy who's at the top of his game and

1756
01:45:54,671 --> 01:45:59,410
he leaves everything behind to go
and serve and love someone else.

1757
01:45:59,530 --> 01:46:04,090
So we really want to tell the story
through film because it's a story that

1758
01:46:04,091 --> 01:46:08,650
really can inspire an entire audience
to fight for something other than

1759
01:46:08,651 --> 01:46:09,970
themselves in a fight for freedom.

1760
01:46:10,210 --> 01:46:13,590
So what I love about Derek and I
choosing the crowdfunding route, uh,

1761
01:46:13,730 --> 01:46:17,770
and being on Kickstarter is that we get
to involve passionate people at to be

1762
01:46:17,771 --> 01:46:19,810
part of the store,
be part of the solution.

1763
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:21,660
And that's why we're inviting you alone.

1764
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:24,400
We could have gone different
routes for funding,

1765
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:27,400
but we wanted to involve
people in this process.

1766
01:46:27,550 --> 01:46:32,550
This is an awesome opportunity to really
give my pygmy family of voice when that

1767
01:46:33,071 --> 01:46:36,910
was my first promise that I gave them
that I could try at least try it,

1768
01:46:36,911 --> 01:46:41,440
to give them a voice. And now I'm asking
you, help me, help me give them a voice.

1769
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:45,550
So this Kickstarter campaign really
is trying to get just the hard costs,

1770
01:46:45,610 --> 01:46:46,390
the whole divorce,

1771
01:46:46,390 --> 01:46:49,710
his film to finish out things that you
have to do to get a film on the biggest

1772
01:46:49,711 --> 01:46:50,544
stage possible.

1773
01:46:50,700 --> 01:46:52,200
That's what we're asking you to do.

1774
01:46:52,201 --> 01:46:55,800
So this money is not going
to me as the filmmaker.

1775
01:46:55,801 --> 01:47:00,480
I am literally giving up all of my time
and the time of my production team for

1776
01:47:00,481 --> 01:47:04,170
free to do this because we really believe
in this story and we hope you do too.

1777
01:47:04,230 --> 01:47:06,480
And we're going to have some amazing
kickbacks were going to be talking to you

1778
01:47:06,481 --> 01:47:07,140
guys.

1779
01:47:07,140 --> 01:47:11,370
We want to make sure that you guys feel
as involved as we do as the filmmakers

1780
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:15,930
and as Justin does as a subject in
going down this journey with us.

1781
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:20,970
So you may be asking, why don't we just
give money to fight for the forgotten,

1782
01:47:20,971 --> 01:47:25,620
which is Justin wrens a organization that
he works with. The answer to that is,

1783
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:29,250
yeah, that would be awesome. In fact, if
you feel like that's where you want to do,

1784
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:34,020
um, and you want to give directly to
help a free pygmy slaves through water,

1785
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:36,090
I would say go for it.
Absolutely.

1786
01:47:36,091 --> 01:47:39,540
Go to fight for the forgotten.com and
give their think of this though as an

1787
01:47:39,541 --> 01:47:43,200
opportunity to see just a
dramatic impact in the lives of,

1788
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:47,430
of the pygmies and honestly in the end,
the lives of our audience as well.

1789
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:50,760
So that's this project and
we hope you get behind us.

1790
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:55,370
Yeah,

1791
01:47:55,370 --> 01:47:57,800
that's awesome. I just
tweeted that out. Oh Wow.

1792
01:47:57,830 --> 01:48:00,260
So if anybody wants to check that out,

1793
01:48:00,261 --> 01:48:04,700
go to my Twitter page and it'll
be up there right now. Today is,

1794
01:48:04,910 --> 01:48:09,110
what's Today's date? The
24th, Monday the 24th.

1795
01:48:09,410 --> 01:48:11,630
So it would be a,
if you're hearing this in the future,

1796
01:48:11,631 --> 01:48:15,890
just go back to Monday the 24th and look
from my Twitter page or go to fighting

1797
01:48:15,891 --> 01:48:18,020
for the forgotten.
Just do a Google start.

1798
01:48:18,050 --> 01:48:22,790
That's a Google a search
rather for Kickstarter fighting
for the forgotten. Yeah.

1799
01:48:23,270 --> 01:48:28,020
The Kickstarter is actually, uh, what
was it? Fighting for? Freedom. Fight. Oh,

1800
01:48:28,190 --> 01:48:30,620
did I say fighting for the
forgotten. Fighting for
freedom. Fighting for freedom.

1801
01:48:30,621 --> 01:48:34,940
But, but the book is fight
for the forgotten that
comes out on September 15th.

1802
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:39,810
Um, there's a book with Loretta
that helped me write that. Yup.

1803
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:44,750
New York Times bestselling author with
Randy wrote big John's book and she

1804
01:48:44,751 --> 01:48:47,360
helped me write this book in
the, it was cool. It was a,

1805
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:50,600
it turned into something like a passion
project for her and that's going to be

1806
01:48:50,601 --> 01:48:54,470
one of the, the kickbacks
on the, um, the Kickstarter.

1807
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:56,750
If you go support the Kickstarter,

1808
01:48:56,751 --> 01:48:59,620
you can get one of the books and
I'll sign it and stuff. And uh,

1809
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:02,600
then if people just want to go on Amazon,
they can get the book.

1810
01:49:02,601 --> 01:49:05,900
And it's like half price right now
till till it actually releases.

1811
01:49:05,901 --> 01:49:09,720
It's like 12 bucks when it
released, there'll be like 24. And,

1812
01:49:09,990 --> 01:49:14,990
and the cool thing about that is 33% of
my portion of anything from the book,

1813
01:49:15,550 --> 01:49:19,910
a 33% goes to the, to the pygmies, goes
to water wells and stuff like that.

1814
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:26,500
When you decided to get back to MMA to
try to bring awareness and try to bring

1815
01:49:26,541 --> 01:49:30,620
more attention to these people, how long
had it been since you were trained? Uh,

1816
01:49:31,010 --> 01:49:35,420
the entire time. Five years? Yeah.
Nothing. Yeah. Nothing. I mean,

1817
01:49:35,421 --> 01:49:39,800
I was hiking through the forest and I was,
I was no martial arts. Absolutely none.

1818
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:44,810
What did it feel like to get back to
the gym the first day? Back to like,

1819
01:49:44,811 --> 01:49:49,660
I should have been
training? No, I, my, my,

1820
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:53,030
my body had hurt for awhile and then
I only really started training, um,

1821
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:57,610
two or three months before
I went this last time,

1822
01:49:57,611 --> 01:50:02,380
which was 10 weeks ago. And then I've
been treating this entire camp to,

1823
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:07,240
um, well, uh, the last 10 weeks
or so. But it, it, it Kinda,

1824
01:50:07,241 --> 01:50:09,430
it was crazy.
They bumped me up on a card quicker.

1825
01:50:09,431 --> 01:50:12,780
And so from going to the Congo
to celebrate the 20th water,

1826
01:50:12,781 --> 01:50:14,200
well plus like visa issues,

1827
01:50:14,201 --> 01:50:18,740
they wanted to try to take it cause
a corrupt my five year visa. And um,

1828
01:50:18,790 --> 01:50:20,710
they were trying to take
it like how, how so? Yeah.

1829
01:50:21,070 --> 01:50:24,880
So when my wife and I left
Congo the last time, uh,

1830
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:28,920
or basically they marked it
down, they wrote it down, uh,

1831
01:50:29,170 --> 01:50:33,130
that we left six months earlier than we
had no nine months earlier than we had.

1832
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:37,220
And I have to go back at
least every 11 months, um,

1833
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:39,240
to check in to show them like, Hey, I'm,

1834
01:50:39,350 --> 01:50:41,860
I'm actively coming into
Congo and doing stuff.

1835
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:45,870
So all of a sudden my time with,
they said, literally, they,

1836
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:50,200
I got a call and it was
from the university and from
our team, uh, the drillers.

1837
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:53,230
And they said, uh, Faa, we heard that, um,

1838
01:50:53,950 --> 01:50:57,100
that you're going to lose your visa
in three weeks. I was like, what? Why?

1839
01:50:57,610 --> 01:50:59,530
And they're like,
go look at your passport.

1840
01:50:59,531 --> 01:51:01,600
Did they write down the
wrong or wrong date?

1841
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:05,290
And so they literally wrote down
the wrong date of me, my exit visa,

1842
01:51:06,010 --> 01:51:11,010
just so that they could try to get
another $1,200 or $1,400 out of me for new

1843
01:51:11,861 --> 01:51:14,260
visa and um,
and I would have lost it.

1844
01:51:14,261 --> 01:51:16,690
And when I went in they
would have a way to say, oh,

1845
01:51:16,691 --> 01:51:20,470
you came in illegally and you lost your
passport and your visa and we're going

1846
01:51:20,471 --> 01:51:24,490
to arrest you and try to get
even more money out of me. Um,

1847
01:51:24,790 --> 01:51:26,680
and when I got my visa the first time,

1848
01:51:26,681 --> 01:51:30,610
literally I didn't have a passport
for over three months in the Congo.

1849
01:51:30,790 --> 01:51:35,790
I had to send my visa or my passport
to the Capitol and people I didn't even

1850
01:51:36,911 --> 01:51:40,930
know, never, I still have never met.
We're handling my passport. Fuck,

1851
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:43,570
I'm in the forest and you
could have been stuck. The,

1852
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:46,990
I could have been stuck 100% and I would
have had to do that again whenever I

1853
01:51:46,991 --> 01:51:51,670
got in back again. Stuck in Canada.
I did get him stuck in Congo.

1854
01:51:51,671 --> 01:51:55,440
I got a friend that was arrested in
Congo for nine days and was thrown in

1855
01:51:55,441 --> 01:51:59,410
basically like a dark dungeon
[inaudible] people for what?

1856
01:51:59,620 --> 01:52:04,330
He had a Gopro and they arrested him
for a Gopro. He said he was a spy,

1857
01:52:04,980 --> 01:52:07,600
um, said he was a spy,
threw him in the embassy.

1858
01:52:07,601 --> 01:52:12,160
How to get involved or eight duty
probably wouldn't want me to, uh,

1859
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:16,030
I wish I could say what, what he
does. Jesus fucking Christ. Yeah.

1860
01:52:16,190 --> 01:52:20,560
Gopro gets you thrown in jail for nine
days and 90 days if you have helped to

1861
01:52:20,561 --> 01:52:21,430
get out.
Yeah.

1862
01:52:21,431 --> 01:52:25,690
And the thing that's crazy about Congo
prisons is you don't get fed. They,

1863
01:52:25,691 --> 01:52:29,380
you have to be fed by people on the
outside. So if you get arrested,

1864
01:52:29,410 --> 01:52:33,310
it's up to your family and friends
to feed you. And so this dude is,

1865
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:37,200
he was all alone and he got
thrown in prison and then, uh,

1866
01:52:37,420 --> 01:52:41,510
you don't have clean water and all they
do bring your water, but it's dirty. Um,

1867
01:52:41,890 --> 01:52:45,680
and I think he was, I think
technically he was in prison in Goma,

1868
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:50,570
which is a crazy city, like most of
the most insane places on planet earth.

1869
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:54,490
A little rebel group
called the [inaudible].

1870
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:57,650
Took it over and not too long ago
or like over over a year, maybe,

1871
01:52:57,651 --> 01:52:59,390
maybe closer to two years now,

1872
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:04,900
but I'm rebel boot group came in the
military and police that were supposed to

1873
01:53:05,391 --> 01:53:09,170
protect Goma Gomez, a million
person, city, a million people.

1874
01:53:09,170 --> 01:53:12,860
At least that's like the,
the capital of the eastern Congo.

1875
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:16,610
It's where been AFLAC is or yeah. Is, um,

1876
01:53:17,330 --> 01:53:21,170
or been f fleck or however you say
his name. Uh, he's there in Congo,

1877
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:25,880
has a real heart for Congo. That's
where a Batman, Ben Affleck. Yeah. Yeah.

1878
01:53:25,881 --> 01:53:28,010
He's got an organization there and um,

1879
01:53:28,070 --> 01:53:31,100
just trying to do some stuff and Angelina
Jolie's it goes there and like helps

1880
01:53:31,101 --> 01:53:33,110
rape victims.
Um,

1881
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:36,440
but when the rebel group came in,

1882
01:53:36,530 --> 01:53:41,420
the military and police that are supposed
to protect it, just ditch their guns,

1883
01:53:41,510 --> 01:53:44,510
ditched everything and ran
away and like, uh, I dunno,

1884
01:53:44,540 --> 01:53:47,570
a small portion just turned over to the
rebels and said they were already rebels.

1885
01:53:47,571 --> 01:53:47,970
Anyways,

1886
01:53:47,970 --> 01:53:52,970
the Congo military is basically comprised
of former rebel groups that disbanded

1887
01:53:54,591 --> 01:53:57,650
and came on with the
government. And so, uh,

1888
01:53:57,690 --> 01:54:02,090
there's like 38 different war warring
rebel groups in just the eastern Congo.

1889
01:54:02,530 --> 01:54:04,930
Uh, I think, I think, uh,

1890
01:54:06,110 --> 01:54:10,940
it was BBC in New York Times.
I'm not sure which one said w which,

1891
01:54:10,941 --> 01:54:11,481
but,
uh,

1892
01:54:11,481 --> 01:54:16,250
they call it the rape capital of the world
and hell on earth for a woman because

1893
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:20,690
a stat had come out in like 2012
or 2011 that said, one woman,

1894
01:54:20,691 --> 01:54:24,800
every one minute is raped in the Congo.
She, it's a, it's a weapon of war.

1895
01:54:24,801 --> 01:54:29,480
It's 1200 women a day. And so, um, yeah,

1896
01:54:29,481 --> 01:54:32,300
it's nuts. It's crazy there. And um,

1897
01:54:32,750 --> 01:54:35,280
and so these guys in
jail there, yeah, he's,

1898
01:54:35,340 --> 01:54:37,340
he was in jail there
for at least six days.

1899
01:54:37,341 --> 01:54:39,110
And then I think they took
him to the capitol from there.

1900
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:42,660
TheU s embassy had to get on. No for
released. No. So how's he getting at?

1901
01:54:42,700 --> 01:54:45,620
What is he doing for just
starving? I think so. I mean,

1902
01:54:46,070 --> 01:54:48,410
I would have to talk to the
guy about it. He, he, he,

1903
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:51,830
him and I haven't really talked
about how all it was, it went down.

1904
01:54:51,890 --> 01:54:55,820
All I know is he works in surrounding
countries and the dude's awesome.

1905
01:54:55,821 --> 01:55:00,821
Like he's got a business that works in
a whole foods and other stuff that goes

1906
01:55:00,861 --> 01:55:04,280
to do social good. It's a really
great, I wish I could say,

1907
01:55:04,290 --> 01:55:08,480
I don't think you'd want me
to tell the story. Um, but
uh, so I won't say his name,

1908
01:55:08,900 --> 01:55:12,680
but he won't come back to Congo. I don't
think, or at least I've heard that from,

1909
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:16,100
from people that surround them and
his family and stuff saying I can only

1910
01:55:16,101 --> 01:55:18,860
imagine. Yeah, absolutely.
It was for Gopro.

1911
01:55:19,010 --> 01:55:22,160
All he had was a Gopro and
they did that crazy thing.

1912
01:55:22,161 --> 01:55:26,660
Now I have the right people in place that,
um,

1913
01:55:27,140 --> 01:55:30,170
that they don't mess with
me as bad, although they do
have messed with me a lot.

1914
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:33,950
Just like that visa, they just tried
to get money out of. Yeah, absolutely.

1915
01:55:34,010 --> 01:55:37,160
What a fun place Africa is. Yeah.
It sounds like a terrific spot.

1916
01:55:37,310 --> 01:55:41,530
Well Jesus Kinda, yeah.
Congos nuts. Matt. Uh,

1917
01:55:41,620 --> 01:55:45,390
so from time you,
you have five years off,

1918
01:55:45,930 --> 01:55:50,310
you start training again.
How long between that and your fight,

1919
01:55:52,110 --> 01:55:55,680
how long of a trained yes.
I think if I put it all together,

1920
01:55:56,490 --> 01:56:01,490
maybe four or five months solid.

1921
01:56:02,410 --> 01:56:06,330
No, no, that's going to split
up. Uh, uh, now I'm ready.

1922
01:56:06,630 --> 01:56:10,260
I can tell you that I'm ready
for the fight. Um, I think,

1923
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:13,920
how long did it take before you
like felt fit again? I mean,

1924
01:56:13,921 --> 01:56:17,500
how long did you before you went back
to sparring and, yeah, I was the,

1925
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:19,070
for the last four or
five months I've been,

1926
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:23,580
I've been going to inspire you to help
Jared Rochelle, like get ready for, um,

1927
01:56:23,581 --> 01:56:27,330
a couple of fights and to help Josh
get ready for a couple of fights. Um,

1928
01:56:27,990 --> 01:56:30,900
and yeah, so I was in their
sparring with the guys and stuff.

1929
01:56:31,410 --> 01:56:33,600
But I'd say at first, man,
it was brutal. It was tough.

1930
01:56:33,630 --> 01:56:38,150
Like my body took a beating and,
uh, I was thinking I needed, um,

1931
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:39,660
I was told I need a knee surgery,

1932
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:43,020
I needed my meniscus cleaned up
and stuff like that. Not a big one,

1933
01:56:43,021 --> 01:56:46,800
but to get scoped. And so I was like,
ah, I don't know what I should do.

1934
01:56:46,801 --> 01:56:51,060
Should I buy it or should have
not. And um, and then I found some,

1935
01:56:51,180 --> 01:56:53,520
some great doctors that
decided to help me.

1936
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:55,680
They actually called IPI there in Denver.

1937
01:56:55,980 --> 01:56:59,340
It's called an integrative performance
institute. It's a new place.

1938
01:56:59,370 --> 01:57:03,300
One of the doctors is the
ironman competitor. She's
awesome. It helps all the NFL,

1939
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:08,270
MLB, NBA guys. But it's with a, we're
talking about it before, but Regina came.

1940
01:57:08,730 --> 01:57:13,590
Yeah, I'm a big fan. I treatment. So
great man. They started you, uh, you,

1941
01:57:13,591 --> 01:57:15,350
you start training and then like,

1942
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:18,270
did you immediately book a
fight or how did you, uh,

1943
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:20,840
how did you decide when you're
going to come back? I came into it.

1944
01:57:20,940 --> 01:57:25,230
So I flew out here three times,
I think for two weeks. And, uh,

1945
01:57:25,231 --> 01:57:28,680
was staying with Loretta
Hunt, um, working on the book.

1946
01:57:29,550 --> 01:57:34,320
And she said, what if, what if I could
get you a meeting with Scott Coker?

1947
01:57:34,490 --> 01:57:36,960
Um, would you want to just go
talk to them about exploring,

1948
01:57:36,961 --> 01:57:41,310
fighting again because she asked me
and said, kind of poked and prodded.

1949
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:43,800
Are you going to fight again or
you're gonna fight again? And, uh,

1950
01:57:44,310 --> 01:57:48,300
and I'd already been thinking about it
and talked to my wife and which my wife's

1951
01:57:48,301 --> 01:57:52,230
never known me as a fighter. She thought
I did Tibo at first she didn't know.

1952
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:56,140
She didn't know what MMA was. No,
when we first started dating and, uh,

1953
01:57:56,610 --> 01:57:59,010
when she found out she was a, Oh, okay.

1954
01:57:59,070 --> 01:58:03,450
Like I told her mixed martial arts and
so she's like Tibo or Kung Fu or do you

1955
01:58:03,451 --> 01:58:05,420
do like cardio kickboxing
with your friends?

1956
01:58:08,130 --> 01:58:11,640
But she's so sweet. She's so awesome. And
this will be your first fight to ever,

1957
01:58:11,730 --> 01:58:15,840
uh, well for me to ever be that she's been
at Josh's to UFC fights and Austin and

1958
01:58:15,841 --> 01:58:19,500
Dallas. Um, so this will be
your third life MMA fight.

1959
01:58:20,220 --> 01:58:24,360
And uh, he keeps saying, Josh,
Josh, Copeland's, Josh, Copa
Nine zero, the cuddly bear.

1960
01:58:24,870 --> 01:58:29,640
Everybody. Um, so when you
are planning on doing this,

1961
01:58:29,700 --> 01:58:33,240
you, you start thinking maybe I
should do it. Loretta prods, you,

1962
01:58:33,510 --> 01:58:35,300
you meet with Scott Coker.
What,

1963
01:58:35,301 --> 01:58:38,640
what made you decide to go with Bella
tour and not go back to the UFC?

1964
01:58:39,090 --> 01:58:43,150
I talked a week or my management,
everything talked with the UFC. Um,

1965
01:58:43,450 --> 01:58:47,680
I would say that man, that's a great
opportunity obviously. Um, I love the UFC.

1966
01:58:47,710 --> 01:58:50,050
It's great. Great, great. Um,

1967
01:58:50,380 --> 01:58:53,170
even you helping support the
water wells and Neymar cord.

1968
01:58:53,210 --> 01:58:55,660
I don't know if I said it last time.
Did I put a,

1969
01:58:55,870 --> 01:58:57,490
from one of his performance bonuses,

1970
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:01,600
he gave us two water wells worth of
a donation. That's awesome, dude.

1971
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:05,960
Nate the great and he's
seriously a great dude. Um,

1972
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:10,270
and he might not have, I
don't know, he probably didn't
want public props, but, uh,

1973
01:59:10,330 --> 01:59:12,280
I'm giving it to him.
Uh,

1974
01:59:12,790 --> 01:59:16,240
and then whenever I came out and met
with Scott though, I just felt like,

1975
01:59:16,780 --> 01:59:19,930
you know, the UFC you could
get, you could get lost.

1976
01:59:19,990 --> 01:59:21,800
And I don't mean that
in a bad way, but, um,

1977
01:59:21,970 --> 01:59:26,470
there's 560 something dude's
under contract. Right. How
many of this belt around,

1978
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:30,820
um, lesson than their,
their main card guys? Um,

1979
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:35,050
I think it's significantly less. And then
also they, whenever I talked with Scott,

1980
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:38,890
it was more of an idea of
we want to get behind this.

1981
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:43,180
Before we even talked fighting, he had
sent out that video you just watched.

1982
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:47,080
He had sent that out to
friends and family saying,

1983
01:59:47,081 --> 01:59:51,370
look what this guy from fighting is done.
And do they even have a champ?

1984
01:59:52,030 --> 01:59:56,200
Who's the heavyweight champ?
Uh, I'm gonna mess it up. Um,

1985
01:59:56,380 --> 01:59:59,020
it's a Russian guy. Uh, Volkov was,

1986
01:59:59,021 --> 02:00:03,000
and now it's a Vitaly or
something like that. I don't,

1987
02:00:03,190 --> 02:00:07,990
nobody knows though. I mean,
it's not going to be me
soon. That's what I'm saying.

1988
02:00:08,050 --> 02:00:10,710
I'm like, you could be developed
or a heavyweight champ.

1989
02:00:10,810 --> 02:00:13,270
That's like a legit possibility.
Right. And I would I,

1990
02:00:13,430 --> 02:00:18,430
this is what I like to look at it as
an me for my wrestling background in

1991
02:00:18,820 --> 02:00:21,640
fighting, sometimes you get,
you don't get this perspective,

1992
02:00:21,641 --> 02:00:25,600
but from a wrestling background, you think
of a podium and the champs at the top.

1993
02:00:25,750 --> 02:00:27,430
And then there's, you
know, the normally there,

1994
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:29,470
there's a top eight are all
Americans or whatever. It's,

1995
02:00:29,471 --> 02:00:33,010
there's a podium of eight guys and
I look at it as me and I want to,

1996
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:36,370
I want to get on that podium and
eventually I want to get to the top.

1997
02:00:36,670 --> 02:00:39,640
I want to get to the top of that podium,
be the guy at the top, the champ.

1998
02:00:40,030 --> 02:00:44,200
Because if I'm there, I have a bigger
voice, a bigger voice for my family. Um,

1999
02:00:44,710 --> 02:00:46,300
and so, I mean, people will look,

2000
02:00:46,301 --> 02:00:49,780
people will watch if I'm on the podium
and I guess they already are because of,

2001
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:51,151
you know,
you and,

2002
02:00:51,151 --> 02:00:55,390
and great people that are getting behind
the story that see that it's important.

2003
02:00:55,391 --> 02:00:58,900
But I know that the
better I do in fighting,

2004
02:00:59,470 --> 02:01:01,360
the more people will listen.

2005
02:01:01,390 --> 02:01:04,870
And I know that's cheap
and shallow at times.

2006
02:01:04,871 --> 02:01:07,150
There's nothing cheaper or
shallow about that at all.

2007
02:01:07,151 --> 02:01:08,620
Did you live in like a movie?

2008
02:01:09,160 --> 02:01:13,480
You're living your life was like
this crazy inspirational movie.

2009
02:01:13,510 --> 02:01:17,620
This is amazing, Bro. You
know, it's amazing. I mean,

2010
02:01:17,930 --> 02:01:20,590
it's uh,
it's just,

2011
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:24,010
it's hard to imagine that
someone could be that selfless.

2012
02:01:24,011 --> 02:01:27,880
It's doing as much as you're doing
it. So it's really, really inspiring.

2013
02:01:28,130 --> 02:01:31,480
Thank you ma'am. Me and whenever
I, whenever I look at it,

2014
02:01:31,481 --> 02:01:33,460
because of the team that we've lined up,
man,

2015
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:38,760
the 17 full timers we got now about
to have 20 each and every one,

2016
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:41,240
those people on that team,

2017
02:01:41,810 --> 02:01:46,810
like they are such fighters and they're
so giving and they're so selfless and

2018
02:01:48,141 --> 02:01:52,910
they'll go live in the fourth year round
and drill wells and teach farming and

2019
02:01:52,911 --> 02:01:53,930
teach all this other stuff.

2020
02:01:53,931 --> 02:01:58,931
So we've got a team of such great people
and we've had to let guys go that just

2021
02:01:59,571 --> 02:02:00,290
weren't,

2022
02:02:00,290 --> 02:02:03,830
weren't with it or are we went through
20 people before we finally got to our

2023
02:02:03,831 --> 02:02:06,590
team that we have now,
legitimately 20 people.

2024
02:02:06,620 --> 02:02:08,900
I can only imagine how many people,

2025
02:02:09,110 --> 02:02:13,320
the amount of dedication that you
have to have to live that life and to,

2026
02:02:13,430 --> 02:02:17,570
to be that selfless, to go over there
and dedicate all of your time and your,

2027
02:02:18,170 --> 02:02:22,880
you mean you don't get to go home. That's
your home now. Yup. And so it's, wow,

2028
02:02:23,050 --> 02:02:26,780
we tried to give them, um,
uh, anywhere from a month,

2029
02:02:26,781 --> 02:02:29,630
minimum to eight weeks
maximum in the forest.

2030
02:02:29,930 --> 02:02:32,300
And then they get to
come home for two weeks,

2031
02:02:32,390 --> 02:02:36,460
rest up a little bit and then
go back out. Um, wow. Dave,

2032
02:02:36,461 --> 02:02:41,150
south probe for parasites. Yeah. Get,
get healed up, get a other stuff.

2033
02:02:41,151 --> 02:02:43,490
So we're looking at ways how we can,

2034
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:45,860
there's no like healthcare
system or insurance there.

2035
02:02:45,861 --> 02:02:49,460
So we're trying to figure out how we
can really set up our team that they're

2036
02:02:49,461 --> 02:02:54,410
giving so much of their bodies, you
know, like their health, their time. Uh,

2037
02:02:54,440 --> 02:02:57,470
they, they, they, we try to
feed them really well out there,

2038
02:02:57,471 --> 02:03:01,640
but still it's not as good as being
in a city or town. I can only imagine,

2039
02:03:01,810 --> 02:03:04,770
and I can only imagine what kind of
medical care they even have out there.

2040
02:03:04,770 --> 02:03:06,350
I mean,
that's why I almost died.

2041
02:03:06,351 --> 02:03:10,340
The four labs told me I didn't have
malaria until I was almost dead.

2042
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:12,710
And then I got out until you're gone.
And they're like,

2043
02:03:13,140 --> 02:03:18,140
they either said 60 to 70 or 65 to
70% of my bloodstream was parasites.

2044
02:03:19,340 --> 02:03:22,250
And in Congo they didn't,
they couldn't see it at all.

2045
02:03:23,750 --> 02:03:28,460
So sometimes like, well,
like our head guy, um, we,

2046
02:03:28,490 --> 02:03:30,890
you know,
his wife was actually poisoned.

2047
02:03:30,980 --> 02:03:34,090
Like people can be just
wicked there and meme,

2048
02:03:34,790 --> 02:03:37,770
somebody tried to poison his wife and
kill her did, did poison it didn't,

2049
02:03:37,870 --> 02:03:40,550
it didn't kill her, but
a almost did, she was,

2050
02:03:40,820 --> 02:03:44,270
she was in a coma because
they were jealous. Literally.

2051
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:48,300
Literally it was just jealousy.
They first tried to get, get, uh,

2052
02:03:48,650 --> 02:03:52,340
I'm not gonna say their names, but first
tried to get her her guy and then when,

2053
02:03:52,341 --> 02:03:54,800
after his wife, because they
knew that if they could get her,

2054
02:03:54,920 --> 02:03:58,790
than it would affect and hurt him.
And so we've,

2055
02:03:58,791 --> 02:04:02,930
we've sent her to Uganda for treatment
and Kenya for treatment and I think

2056
02:04:02,931 --> 02:04:06,080
they've come, maybe gone
through Tanzania, but um,

2057
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:08,840
but it's been months and months.
Like she's,

2058
02:04:09,260 --> 02:04:13,370
she's partially has been
partially paralyzed on one
side of her body from it and,

2059
02:04:13,371 --> 02:04:16,160
uh, is learning going through
Rehab, everything else.

2060
02:04:16,161 --> 02:04:19,230
So there's lots of stuff with
health and so we want to,

2061
02:04:19,250 --> 02:04:22,150
we want to try to see how we can,
um,

2062
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:25,580
loving her team that's given
so much, you know, like, hey,

2063
02:04:25,610 --> 02:04:28,940
whenever you guys got a health thing, let
us know and we want to take care of it.

2064
02:04:30,110 --> 02:04:33,860
So that's what's awesome. The backing
of water for their all in. And, uh,

2065
02:04:34,820 --> 02:04:37,920
honestly whenever I first got back I was
like, how am I going to do this thing?

2066
02:04:38,730 --> 02:04:43,080
How am I going to do it by myself? And,
uh, because that's how it's kind of been.

2067
02:04:43,260 --> 02:04:44,093
Um,

2068
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:48,480
I mean I got a lot of support after being
on the show and lots of people were,

2069
02:04:48,481 --> 02:04:49,500
were behind it.

2070
02:04:49,830 --> 02:04:53,850
But when it comes to like the business
side of it and filing with us government

2071
02:04:53,851 --> 02:04:57,810
and all that other stuff, it was like,
man, I got a CPA, I got other people,

2072
02:04:57,811 --> 02:05:02,250
got my board, everything else. But I'm
like me. And all I want to do is go there,

2073
02:05:02,550 --> 02:05:06,750
be there with them, fanned the flames,
teach them stuff, love on them.

2074
02:05:06,930 --> 02:05:10,710
And then when I come back here, I need
to, to, to, to come on things like this,

2075
02:05:10,711 --> 02:05:13,320
speak about it. I need to train,
I need to fight, I need to win.

2076
02:05:13,740 --> 02:05:17,130
But I don't necessarily need to do all
the business side of things. So anyways,

2077
02:05:17,131 --> 02:05:20,220
waterfall has been awesome on
getting behind us in that route.

2078
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:21,181
That's a beautiful,

2079
02:05:21,181 --> 02:05:25,350
that you've formed this incredible group
of people in this organization coming,

2080
02:05:25,351 --> 02:05:28,560
becoming a part of you or you
becoming a part of them right now.

2081
02:05:28,740 --> 02:05:32,670
You're Beltour fight
one is it? And uh, it's,

2082
02:05:32,671 --> 02:05:35,530
it's live on spike.
Take a bike.

2083
02:05:35,600 --> 02:05:39,390
It starts at a 8:00 PM.
Uh,

2084
02:05:40,350 --> 02:05:45,180
well it starts 9:00 PM central. What
day? Uh, August. 28th on Friday. Oh,

2085
02:05:45,181 --> 02:05:49,210
so it's next week. Is this
week? This week? This week
man. It's Friday night. Yeah.

2086
02:05:49,230 --> 02:05:52,640
Today's the 20. Yeah. Well
today's the 24th. Yeah. So
it's four days from now. Yeah.

2087
02:05:52,890 --> 02:05:57,120
Where are you finding it's in
Temecula. Oh, the Jenga. Okay.

2088
02:05:57,150 --> 02:06:01,830
So fine up a chain. It's 8:08 PM
central 9:00 PM Eastern. Wow. Yeah.

2089
02:06:01,900 --> 02:06:05,640
Me Know who you find a learning
Kurtz. Um, I'm fighting a Josh Burns.

2090
02:06:06,360 --> 02:06:10,560
Josh Burns is fight fought for Bella to,
or five times, I think, maybe, maybe six,

2091
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:15,240
but I think this is a sixth fight and
billet door. Um, he's a, he's a tough guy.

2092
02:06:15,420 --> 02:06:20,160
He, he hits hard. He's a
finisher. Get finished guy. Um,

2093
02:06:20,190 --> 02:06:23,500
his records only I think
like eight and eight. Um,

2094
02:06:24,030 --> 02:06:26,890
so the kind of, I mean, he,

2095
02:06:26,891 --> 02:06:31,290
he goes out there and either crushes guys
or he gets crushed. So that's my plan.

2096
02:06:31,291 --> 02:06:34,860
Go in there and crush him.
Even though I hear he's a standup guy.

2097
02:06:34,861 --> 02:06:35,641
I've had so many people,

2098
02:06:35,641 --> 02:06:39,300
even as friends and messaging me saying
how great of a guy he is as a person,

2099
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:43,610
and that is kind of hard for them
to root against them or, or things.

2100
02:06:43,611 --> 02:06:47,020
So it's cool. I'm going to fight a good
dude, but he's got to go down because

2101
02:06:48,710 --> 02:06:51,570
there's, there's, there's a
lot more riding on it for me.

2102
02:06:51,571 --> 02:06:55,680
There's so much more at stake now.
Wow. It never before. I'll listen man.

2103
02:06:55,681 --> 02:06:57,360
I'll be watching.
Thank you man.

2104
02:06:57,450 --> 02:07:02,100
Best of luck and give out all the
information so people can contribute.

2105
02:07:02,300 --> 02:07:06,930
Uh, W I gave out the Kickstarter
on Twitter. What else can they do?

2106
02:07:06,930 --> 02:07:10,500
How they, how can they contribute to
water for what else can I get to? Yeah.

2107
02:07:10,670 --> 02:07:14,790
If they, if they want to follow me on
social media, there's a, on Twitter,

2108
02:07:14,791 --> 02:07:18,870
I'm the big pygmy and on Instagram I'm the
big pig. Me, that's the my booty. Mongo.

2109
02:07:19,590 --> 02:07:23,730
Uh, it just means the big pig me. Um, so
that's what a lot of the people call me.

2110
02:07:24,150 --> 02:07:29,100
Um, that's where the nickname comes
from. Um, by the way that it's random,

2111
02:07:29,101 --> 02:07:31,470
but there's three kiddos
now in those three.

2112
02:07:31,500 --> 02:07:35,620
One of them is in tuned to that village
he's named is my booty Mongo Justin.

2113
02:07:35,900 --> 02:07:40,180
And so that's his full name is
the big pygmy Justin. Wow. And uh,

2114
02:07:40,510 --> 02:07:42,940
so that's kind of one of the
reasons why I'm like, you know what,

2115
02:07:42,941 --> 02:07:47,110
that should be my nickname, not
the viking anyways, but, um,

2116
02:07:47,350 --> 02:07:51,700
how they can contribute is me and fight
for the forgotten.org fight for the

2130
02:08:43,910 --> 02:08:47,960

airplanes that I sit next to,

it and someone at the hotel and just all

2132
02:08:52,551 --> 02:08:54,950

around and people are like, oh,

Rogan show. And I'm just like, what?
