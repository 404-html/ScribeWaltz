1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,110
Act like there is.
I assumed there is always assume.

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,400
Whoo.
Merry Christmas ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,410
Yeah.
Merry Christmas.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,060
It's fucking on.
You understand me?

5
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:14,780
It's Christmas Eve.
You thought it was going to be Ho hum.

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,980
Fuck you.
Uncle Joey.

7
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:21,981
Joe Rogan had fucking live Christmas eve
talking about bugs in your house and how

8
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:22,944
easy it is for the feds.
They don't need a bug your house 

9
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:26,310
anymore.
They just use your phone.

10
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,200
Just turned on my Jamie.
Tell them,

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,640
tell them what you were telling me about
that.

12
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:32,310
Uh,
the airpods Oh yeah.

13
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:34,160
There's a,
there's a new setting on the,

14
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:35,080
uh,
a new,

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,953
uh,
an operating system where your airpods 

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,360
you turned onto this thing called live.
Listen.

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,360
And it's listening to the microphone on 
your iphone.

18
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,830
So you can leave your phone in a room,
walk out and you can use.

19
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,693
Just made your own bug.
But that means that anybody that can 

20
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:53,910
then access your phone could probably 
also listen if they have access to that.

21
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,743
I don't know how drive already said like
can you talk to anybody that knows 

22
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,643
what's possible with electronics that 
can already turn your microphone on 

23
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:02,910
anytime they want.
Pro.

24
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:03,744
When I was a kid,
I grew up in that book making Shit and 

25
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,780
there was certain bookmakers that 
wouldn't talk in a room that there was a

26
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:12,300
phone in the room,
smart ones in the seventies.

27
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,453
Not talking on the phone,
but if there was a phone in the room 

28
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,450
they would leave the room.
Yeah,

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,330
that's nice.
At least super paranoid.

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,673
They were 30 years ahead of that time.
Will you remember how they got Vincent 

31
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:25,794
the chin.
They started bugging cars along the way 

32
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:28,404
where he would walk.
He would walk with his bathrobe like he 

33
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:31,284
was crazy and he would give everybody 
instructions and he would do it on his 

34
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:36,000
walk so he couldn't get bugged anywhere.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,760
So they started bugging the cars along 
his walk route.

36
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,280
That's how they got.
Get you with the mic?

37
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,790
Yeah,
it was a lot of the same microphone.

38
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:45,624
They usually nfl.
When you hear all those tackles and 

39
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,930
grunts in the old days they had a 
parabolic mic.

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,950
Takes vibrations from glass.
Yeah.

41
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,050
So I could just point this laser at your
glass.

42
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,913
Which speakers on and they'll take 
whatever you're saying in a room and 

43
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:03,750
bounce it off the glass.
I've heard it.

44
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,490
There's a fucking ass.
So by now,

45
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:09,750
which world class they can do what?
They're listening to.

46
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:11,340
Everything.
Everything.

47
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,400
Anything and everything.
I in the bathroom on the plane,

48
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,353
you have to assume that watching it,
like I used to go in there and do blast 

49
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:20,640
a coke.
I would always pull my pants down,

50
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,133
go through the whole process.
Like I was shit and that wasn't really 

51
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:27,840
shit and I just always thought it was a 
camera there.

52
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,023
Well you'd probably be correct.
I've heard things that are just hard 

53
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,263
about vegas in the eighties.
How they had cameras in Vegas in the 

54
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,513
eighties.
It was all my vegas and the bathrooms 

55
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:42,300
have cameras.
So as soon as you do a blast,

56
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,180
you come out within 10 minutes of cops 
around you.

57
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,890
When did they,
when did the mob like officially get out

58
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:52,260
of Vegas?
Like with the mob is still in Vegas.

59
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,180
Just short spurts.
It's crazy.

60
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,010
I was in New York last week and I 
realized how much construction was going

61
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,853
on

62
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,053
and I thought to myself,
how much of that is the mob still 

63
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,280
getting?
They had attacks for years,

64
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:09,150
two percent.
So it fits a $300,

65
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:11,020
million dollar job.
Do the math on that.

66
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:15,200
You make it a big chunk on that 
construct.

67
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,263
You know,
trump didn't get rich because the 

68
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:20,470
construction business is huge and you 
got to New York,

69
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,910
you know,
uh,

70
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,090
I can't give you accurate numbers 
because I don't know the numbers are.

71
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,590
But look what the averages for a square 
foot of concrete in New York.

72
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:35,290
And look what the averages in Iowa.
I was reading something about that.

73
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,320
The square foot of,
to build a building in New York,

74
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,233
same.
The concrete is fucking insane because 

75
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,110
so many hands are getting fucking 
greased.

76
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,450
You know,
you don't pay a job.

77
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,160
Okay?
So you don't pay.

78
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,350
It's like that one episode of the 
Sopranos.

79
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,440
So what I do is break your balls.

80
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,670
You would gc you don't want to pay me my
money.

81
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,073
That's fine.
I sent somebody from the Union and 

82
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,340
instead of me doing this,
come on through.

83
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,180
I gotta stop you gotTa.
Take your book.

84
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,920
I got to call the unit to see if you 
paid your dues.

85
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,560
We check your tire pressure.
We can help.

86
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:14,670
Let's the windows on the truck.
Recently you got 30 trucks backed up and

87
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:17,830
you're not making any money.
That's how they shake you down.

88
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,530
That's the shame then.
Or you paid me.

89
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:21,760
Okay.
The trucks go through.

90
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,180
Don't worry.
Would sign them.

91
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,213
We don't care who the driver is.
We don't care if it's union or non 

92
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:27,844
union.
It's such a dirty business at that 

93
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:31,070
level.
That's the shade.

94
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,120
Now trump would be the GC on the job.
You pay your job runs smooth,

95
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,713
you don't pay.
So two percent of them went to the mom 

96
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,124
that concrete tax.
Then they had like another two percent 

97
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:48,541
right off the top 200 bid rig bedroom 
bed rigging.

98
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,910
Where we take,
we give it to Joe Rogan.

99
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,430
No matter what the price is,
we inflate the price.

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,150
Even though Jamie comes in $3,000,000
cheaper,

101
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,660
I'm going to give Joe Rogan that three 
and two more.

102
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,150
Joe Rogan's going to kick that to me and
we're going to do the job,

103
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:08,950
but that's $3,000,000
profit.

104
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:12,040
Plus I'm going to take two percent off 
the top of that $3,000,000

105
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:12,100
a

106
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,040
profit.
You know what I noticed when I was a kid

107
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,440
when I was working construction,
one of the first things I noticed,

108
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:21,441
it's one of the weird businesses that's 
run almost exclusively by men like manly

109
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:24,414
men,
like the construction guys were burly 

110
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:31,701
dudes with big fucking hands.
They worked hard and they were like,

111
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,510
these were like rough guys,
but they were running a big business.

112
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,003
It's like all these other businesses.
If you think about businesses you think 

113
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:43,470
about like computers,
you don't think about like rugged,

114
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,813
burly guys,
but computers and construction or just 

115
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:50,220
as calm and like everybody needs a 
computer.

116
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:52,740
Everybody needs a house like 
constructions everywhere.

117
00:05:52,741 --> 00:05:57,741
It's a gigantic business and it's run at
least in back in when I was working as a

118
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:01,980
laborer.
It was run by these big savages too.

119
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,790
Fucking big dangerous guys,
but it's gotten more diverse now because

120
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,850
unions have made you hire more women.

121
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,700
When I was no attrition,
like three months and there was a female

122
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:14,534
supervisor who knew her shit.
A Dad that was electrician when she was 

123
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:24,971
a kid that was fucking day job and men 
had a tough time working for.

124
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,280
I clicked with her.
She was easy.

125
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,550
She would leave me the fuck alone.
Sometimes men can't.

126
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,840
They just have a real hard time with a 
woman telling me I didn't.

127
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,890
I didn't mind that at all.
I didn't give a fuck.

128
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:39,770
I liked her.
If someone's great at their job,

129
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:42,890
they're great at their job.
Just kind of give a fuck what the gender

130
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:45,680
is.
A weird thing that a lot of guys have,

131
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:46,514
right?
You know,

132
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,220
female trainer,
that female trainers.

133
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,890
A lot of people don't go for that.
Female Yoel Romero.

134
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,050
One of the best mother fuckers of all 
time.

135
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,050
What is she trained them in?
No Man's fit.

136
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,100
Strengthen conditioning.
She was strengthening conditioning.

137
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:04,250
Training him in this videos,
watching Boston his ass.

138
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,610
Well,
even like super savage know.

139
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,503
Make sure I'm right about that.
Make sure my worried about that because 

140
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:13,580
if it's not well,
it's someone equally savage,

141
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,750
someone who's just fuck this super alpha
mean.

142
00:07:16,751 --> 00:07:18,440
No one's a super alpha like,
well,

143
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,270
when we had them in the podcast I was 
looking at,

144
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:22,580
I'm sitting there,
I was saying this guy has built,

145
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,990
it's not even a real person with 12 
hours should get over.

146
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,953
I remember that night we both had spots 
the store and I pulled you aside and I 

147
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:32,750
go,
what really think?

148
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,720
What do you really think?
I mean there's this guy,

149
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:36,554
shoot the people,
or is this something that just think 

150
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,580
it's genetic super freak genetic.
Well,

151
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:45,530
when we went to eat at,
I went to New York last week,

152
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,753
I purposely went to a SAR and Tina,
it's a restaurant North Berg and don't 

153
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,713
run by this dude named Jocko Jesus 
Christ to spaghetti with a tiny 

154
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:53,990
meatballs.

155
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,823
I couldn't even finish it,
but one of his waiters was a wrestler 

156
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,780
and listened to the podcast and he was 
saying he wasn't that good.

157
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,070
He was on the bottom floor.
He ate the scraps and he.

158
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,801
But he goes,
yeah,

159
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:12,320
I know you're well from back there.
Just last week.

160
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,380
Think about the other super athletes 
that have come out of Cuba,

161
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:17,600
but that have gotten into mma and 
boxing.

162
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay.
Hector Lombard,

163
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,650
dude,
my,

164
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:23,950
a lot of people,
they might look at Hector lumbar because

165
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,860
of some of his tough fights that he had 
in the UFC later in his career.

166
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,390
But if you go back and watch Hector 
Lombard Willingness,

167
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,810
rod and shit and bell,
it tore.

168
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:37,720
Those were probably his prime years.
He was the champion at Belterra.

169
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,740
I mean fucking smashing people.
Smashing people at 185 pounds.

170
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,790
And then he came over to the UFC.
He fought one 85,

171
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,670
but there's a big ass one 80 fives in 
the UFC man.

172
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,030
I mean hector is.
What do you think?

173
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:55,320
He's five sex really?
Not that.

174
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,940
No,
I think he's.

175
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,960
I think he's either my height or I'm 
five.

176
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,030
Eight.
He's either my hydro,

177
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:06,031
he's an inch taller but he's so jacked.
And when he was,

178
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,970
when he was smashing people,
like earlier as career man,

179
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:11,370
I always wanted to get him in the UFC.
I was like,

180
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:12,940
this guy needs to come over.
He's,

181
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,030
he's so athletic,
man.

182
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,550
He would,
and he's a judo player.

183
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:17,941
I mean,
it's,

184
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:20,400
look how fucking checked hector is.
He's,

185
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,190
you know,
he was a judo player for Cuba,

186
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,383
but I'm telling you meant did,
you could take all the steroids in the 

187
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:28,380
world.
You're not going to move.

188
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:31,140
Like this guy moves.
Josh lumbar.

189
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,360
Josh Barnett Rather told me that,
uh,

190
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,020
Hector Lombard when he went to the gym 
could just do muscle up after muscle up.

191
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,390
Never even trained it before.
It's saw.

192
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,400
Jamie will tell you,
it's fucking hard to do a muscle up.

193
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,900
He just grabs that bar.

194
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,840
He's a super athlete.
He's just had a lot of really,

195
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:51,510
really rough fights against the best 
fighters in the world.

196
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,273
And I,
I really think that some of his best 

197
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:57,990
fights you could say like maybe he was 
tested more and I think he certainly was

198
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,973
tested more here in the UFC then it 
wasn't belt or certainly the caliber of 

199
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:03,894
competition is far greater.
But I also think fighters have like a 

200
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:10,440
window of opportunity for the most part.
For most of them.

201
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,590
There's exceptions where they can extend
that window,

202
00:10:13,591 --> 00:10:14,880
that window,
the the,

203
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,820
the experts seem to think the windows 
around nine years.

204
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,013
This is not a number that I invented,
but it's a number that I agree with in 

205
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,704
terms of like the best you have,
you might be able to do it for nine 

206
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:26,034
years,
like fate or the longevity of another 

207
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,770
running back a street and a half years,
which blew my mind.

208
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,780
That's crazy.
That blew my mind.

209
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,080
I started thinking about it.
I talk about all the greats.

210
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:39,300
I'd go to a butter.
Oh Campbell,

211
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:41,430
Jim Brown,
those guys.

212
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:45,060
I thought about their injuries.
How lucky you have to be.

213
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:46,620
Okay.
Though.

214
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,453
The UFC is a fighter.
How many people actually did fight in 

215
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:54,480
the UFC for nine years straight so far 
out a lot.

216
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,430
There's been quite a few.
A Lot,

217
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,450
but at the same time there's been a lot 
of guys that have had great both pension

218
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,370
by the fourth or fifth fight.
They've moved on.

219
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,650
Well,
you know,

220
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,050
everybody's different.
This is the thing.

221
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,420
Everybody's different in terms of their 
ability to recuperate.

222
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,340
Everybody's different in terms of their 
style.

223
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,560
Like some guys just don't take much 
damage,

224
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,180
you know,
something like Ben Aspirin,

225
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,070
perfect example,
never fought in the UFC,

226
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:23,370
but when you watch him fight in these 
other organizations,

227
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,550
thing that's most interesting is that it
doesn't take any damage you could say is

228
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:27,570
boring if you want to.

229
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,153
I don't think it's boring.
I think it's super high level wrestling 

230
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,600
and you need to see how that shit would 
fly against the best in the world.

231
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:39,150
I mean that's why he's here now.
I'm very excited about this,

232
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:43,020
but he's a perfect example of like he 
doesn't have any problems.

233
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,730
That guy has been fighting for a long 
time.

234
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:46,590
You talked to him.
He says lucid as they come.

235
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,540
He's articulate.
He's very smart,

236
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,340
very well educated,
reads books all the time.

237
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,100
He'll send me recommendations for books.
Very,

238
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:57,610
very interesting guy.
So you've got those guys who like,

239
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,473
he could do it for a long fucking time 
because he's not taking a beating when 

240
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:03,370
you start taking a beating man pool.
You know,

241
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,263
some guys,
sometimes guys try to get back in there 

242
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:08,740
too soon and they're still hurting,
you know,

243
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,670
from,
from a fight,

244
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:10,504
like a really bad knockout or uh,
just sometimes even just getting beaten 

245
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:16,270
up is we're like,
you get,

246
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:19,630
if you don't get stopped,
like you incur more damage that way,

247
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,870
you know,
for a long ass fight than you would in a

248
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:24,310
quick Kao,
you know,

249
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,410
like I'm in glory.

250
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,930
You know,
Joseph Valtellina deal,

251
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,773
you know that the zoo could joe,
he was their champion and he won the 

252
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:33,064
title against Mark Dumond after the 
fight couldn't fight again because 

253
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,010
concussions were so bad.
He couldn't look at a,

254
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,650
the light from a,
an iphone charger,

255
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,663
like a laptop charger.
That little light from that thing would 

256
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,293
be blinding to him.
He had to be like in a dark room for 

257
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:50,680
three weeks.
Cbd Oil brought them out of it.

258
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,520
When I think of fighters and what 
happens during a fight,

259
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,473
I go back all the way to Bernard Hopkins
against Felix trailer that because you 

260
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,670
brought it up to my attention,
I never even knew about that world.

261
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,660
He never came back,
said,

262
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,890
who's the guy that went the distance 
that's known?

263
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:15,910
Bella coola fights out of GSPS.
Can't really.

264
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:21,121
Tough guy went five rounds with fucking 
what's his name is Rory Macdonald.

265
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,840
Rory Rory.
After that fight that he had,

266
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,610
he was never really the same title.
Robbie lawler for Robbie lawler fight.

267
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,280
Fight to affect you in different ways to
beat and you take.

268
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,683
Affects you in different ways.
I want to see what the kid that Edson 

269
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,980
Barboza fights with next time he comes 
out,

270
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,580
he took a ferocious beating against at 
Edgar Edson,

271
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,540
that last fight before allocated the and
Kevin Lee.

272
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,351
See,
but rory,

273
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:52,600
I got to disagree because after that 
fight,

274
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:56,100
he looked fucking phenomenal in beltour 
and his first wife.

275
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,690
Who was his first fight and belt,
or was it Paul Daley?

276
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,220
He fought.
Um,

277
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,940
but then the next fight,
he didn't mean he was a beast though.

278
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:04,803
Dude knew him as a monster man.
Douglas Lema is a fucking straight up 

279
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:11,350
killer.
You know the comedy sometimes.

280
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,220
Was it Paul Daley?
So he manhandled Paul daily.

281
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,470
It's very smart fight because he fought 
really well on his feet first.

282
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,270
Threatened daily,
little bit on his feet and then took him

283
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:20,104
down,
dominated them on the ground and it was 

284
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:21,941
uh,
it was,

285
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:23,680
uh,
it was a very impressive win.

286
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,300
But then he fought.
See,

287
00:14:25,301 --> 00:14:30,090
fighting Musashi I think was probably 
not the,

288
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,450
but you know,
you never know.

289
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,800
You know,
you got to test yourself.

290
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,530
There's only one way to do that.
And he knows better than anybody.

291
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:36,364
I mean the guys in it to test himself 
now he knows that he can't beat massage 

292
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,820
at least at this point in his life.
But he's a smart kid.

293
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,650
Then he's,
he's an animal to.

294
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,311
I mean,
that guy is.

295
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:49,600
So I will not say that.
I just thought that a lot of times after

296
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:52,160
battles,
people don't come back

297
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,840
the same.
I agree on some of them,

298
00:14:53,841 --> 00:14:55,220
but I don't,
I don't agree with him.

299
00:14:55,221 --> 00:15:00,221
The guy from Texas that took GSP to the 
zoo and he never came.

300
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,250
You know,
some people give it all.

301
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:06,880
You got to give it all.
You got moment.

302
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,530
It's either react after that,
uh,

303
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:12,410
what's going to happen?
How is Kevin legally to come back?

304
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,560
So I quit that.
You always have those questions,

305
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:16,970
which is a great fight,
by the way.

306
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,833
Amazing though.
The fight I was most excited about this 

307
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:23,420
weekend was Michael Gac.
Carlos conduit,

308
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,560
right.
It's a good buddy would call those of,

309
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,820
you know,
call of little.

310
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,860
Been around for a long fucking time,
just name is conduct,

311
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:31,694
but because he knows I'm his brother and
I'm one of the biggest fans and the 

312
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,603
Mafia.
I'd hire him from the UFC a long time 

313
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:41,690
ago because he's an assassin.
He's realized John,

314
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,600
when you just give him a gun with a 
silencer,

315
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,750
a pencil,
let him do the rest.

316
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,180
Go down and you could switch his mind 
quick with $600,000

317
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:53,960
a week.
I want to say that his UFC was his debut

318
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:56,350
against Brock Larson.
Was that it was as debut.

319
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,780
Was that in the WEC?
I feel like that was in the WEC.

320
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:03,130
I feel like his debut was against um,

321
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,780
Shit.

322
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,220
Uh,
was it Jake Martin?

323
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:20,510
Kampmann was his debut in Nashville,
a natural birth or own burger.

324
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:25,361
Was that.
Oh,

325
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:27,330
that was jake ellenberger his first 
fight in UFC.

326
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,840
Yeah,
to Jake ellenberger was another one.

327
00:16:30,841 --> 00:16:33,510
Met Super fucking dangerous for a long 
time,

328
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:34,344
man.
You ever see before he fought in the 

329
00:16:35,221 --> 00:16:37,230
UFC,
when he knocked out Palae with one punch

330
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,293
to beat in my office about three weeks 
ago he came into my office and he's the 

331
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,930
nicest guy.
I heard you got a gallon.

332
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:46,803
Dosed him up.
I gave a bunch of this shit that was 31 

333
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,530
percent.
He couldn't answer questions dog.

334
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,010
It was like,
fuck it.

335
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,400
He's the best.
The poor bastard.

336
00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:59,430
He didn't know how to drive home folks.
Boom.

337
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,660
Data was not around.
Rocco was broke.

338
00:17:03,661 --> 00:17:04,494
This system for a week.
If you think brock lesnar system 

339
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:08,700
disappeared,
the fucking system.

340
00:17:08,701 --> 00:17:10,620
Whatever.
Oh my God.

341
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,850
What?
Jake ellenberger.

342
00:17:11,851 --> 00:17:12,780
We took them deep.

343
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,070
I haven't seen it,
but I've heard.

344
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:14,881
He told me.
He goes,

345
00:17:14,881 --> 00:17:15,830
you know,
I don't smoke them.

346
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,830
I didn't do a little bungalow and I 
asked him a question after that.

347
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:20,664
He was just frustrated.
I love that he's coming back to redeem 

348
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:24,210
himself.
Sad.

349
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,780
He's never smoked and again,
but that was toughest battle.

350
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,070
Yeah,
you can't.

351
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,850
That's too much.
That's a three foot bong.

352
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:33,751
Well,
not only that,

353
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:34,584
joey,
for most people that don't do podcasts 

354
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,710
all the time,
getting on your podcast,

355
00:17:38,711 --> 00:17:41,580
it's a mind fuck because it was like,
I can't believe I'm here.

356
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,070
I'm sitting here with Uncle Joey.
Holy Shit.

357
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,990
And then boom,
that 30,

358
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:47,790
how many percent?
Thirty one.

359
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,520
That's so high.
This is alien.

360
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:51,300
Whoa.
Gee,

361
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,330
this is in,
in.

362
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,670
Just as a.
for people that don't know the numbers,

363
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,190
let's find out what the numbers actually
are.

364
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:00,024
Like.
What was.

365
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,320
What percentage thc was marijuana in the
19 seventies?

366
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,700
I want to say it was like eight to 10 
probably.

367
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,130
I'm just guessing.
It's so funny how.

368
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,860
Okay.
I grew up in New York,

369
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,813
New Jersey,
so I would go to Harlem and what we had 

370
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:22,461
available to us was a Panama Red 
Colombian gold.

371
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,340
I could be worse.
I could be running other names.

372
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,833
And then you had from Jamaica,
you had this week called lamins bread 

373
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,183
and then suddenly the eighties,
the green weed came along and they 

374
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:36,684
called it since Amelia,
so I was copying a hundred and 48th 

375
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,124
street.
Then he will either sell your chocolate 

376
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,710
pie,
which is lamb's bread,

377
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,053
or he would sell you a sense of me,
yet he would put them together and call 

378
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:52,840
it the master mix and then if you bought
10 bags of the master mix,

379
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,950
she got one for free,
gave you a punch card.

380
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,620
This is why not go a real punch.

381
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,023
Nineteen 83 slash 83.
The guy was in the middle of the corner 

382
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:04,344
hanging out and the funny thing was I 
went back in [inaudible] 85 and he 

383
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:07,720
looked me straight in the face and he 
was like,

384
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,290
ain't no motherfucking weed on this 
block.

385
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:14,550
No more dog crap.
Like it had just converted to crack,

386
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:16,440
but this is why.
Watch him.

387
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,930
I told you that watching Narcos,
Mexico,

388
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:23,500
those first two episodes are so 
important because it's like,

389
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,740
it's like some comments when you watch a
TV show,

390
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,143
it's really hard to believe that one day
some Spanish guy that couldn't even 

391
00:19:29,671 --> 00:19:30,670
speak English said,
hey,

392
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,560
there's not three cameras here.
His name was fucking loose.

393
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,410
Desi Arnaz.
Desi Arnaz invented that.

394
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:39,080
The three camera shoot.
You know that.

395
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,313
That's hilarious.
That desi loop production to all that 

396
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:44,430
shit.
He's the one that said,

397
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,820
took her eight white people sitting 
around,

398
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,570
get two more cameras.

399
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,060
Let's go underlay.
Oh,

400
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,013
the guy that did the principle Guy 
Narcos to share is a character who grew 

401
00:19:56,731 --> 00:20:00,930
weed in the desert.
I want you to think about that,

402
00:20:00,931 --> 00:20:02,850
and I've never been even thought of 
before,

403
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,580
but by doing that,
I don't know the science,

404
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:07,800
so please Joe Rogan.
People don't torture me.

405
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:12,860
He eliminated the male plant to make the
female stronger.

406
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,880
The only way you could grow that isn't 
the desert,

407
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:15,714
so he found water in the desert.
Why is it the only way you can go grow 

408
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:19,134
in the desert?
It's something about the climate to to 

409
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,900
roof so that it's like the immaculate 
conception when you get pregnant without

410
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,583
getting pregnant,
so you eliminate the male plants or 

411
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,104
something.
I do not know this information and we 

412
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:35,754
have to hide this information from women
so there's no seeds and the reefer get 

413
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:43,230
stronger.
That started in the eighties.

414
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:45,300
That's why if you watched Narcos,
Mexico,

415
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,740
it shows you how that whole thing 
started

416
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,103
and they were pumping 15 metric tons a 
year into the United States with this 

417
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:54,850
shit green.
We'd became Mexican.

418
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:59,851
Green Weed was when we started smoking.
I got to say that average was maybe 15.

419
00:21:01,631 --> 00:21:06,631
Then like the strongest and then there's
weeds down 21 percent.

420
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,043
They take me to the fucking mountain,
but that 28 or above and a bong you'd 

421
00:21:12,761 --> 00:21:13,594
do.
You started in your mum when you're 

422
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,600
fucking can't focus.
I like that feeling.

423
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:21,250
At night when I listened to music,

424
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,550
I'm a big music will not.
I called you.

425
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,663
It was like October third and I was 
going to call you to tell you that I 

426
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:33,100
love to participate in so broad,
but because of my love for music,

427
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:33,934
it's not going to happen because my 
thing is to go home at night or 

428
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,233
sometimes I go to the office.
Like I told you my house is dead at 20 

429
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:45,370
to nine or 8:30
and my wife's in bed 10 minutes later.

430
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,690
Some nights I don't have a spa podcast.
I just go to my office.

431
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,900
I bring a notebook on my ipad,
my get stoned,

432
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,243
and I put it on the album.
I go down the album road and I just get 

433
00:21:57,011 --> 00:22:00,350
fucked up and listen to that music.
I love it.

434
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,110
That's my hobby and once a week I go to 
the album store and buying a while.

435
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,113
New Vinyl album.
Lately I would now that led Zepplin to 

436
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,860
road.
That's one of the greatest,

437
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,320
dirtiest filthiest opens up with a whole
lot of love.

438
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:24,300
It's just dirty lemon song and then the 
heartbreak at.

439
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,400
It's just dirty and then I've been 
listening to fucking physical graffiti.

440
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,740
I love going into those foxholes way 
that knightstone

441
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,040
yeah,
there's something about that music.

442
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:38,874
They.
They were the first drug culture music 

443
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,780
in America,
right?

444
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:48,900
If you think about it,
like Zeppelin and pink floyd showed up,

445
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,960
but they went to India.
They grew long hand.

446
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:56,680
They came back with those four items.
Then there was rumors of acid.

447
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,610
If you listen to the one robotic,
it revolve.

448
00:23:00,611 --> 00:23:05,611
One of those John Lennon spreads acid 
bond that was there.

449
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,990
I mean there's A.
There's a lot of musicians from that era

450
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:10,030
that are great,
that aren't associated with drugs,

451
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,580
but if you think of Hendrix,
if you think of.

452
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,160
I mean Hendrix was always associated 
with drugs.

453
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,830
Janis Joplin always associated with 
drugs,

454
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,490
you know,
good or bad.

455
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,650
It's.
It's very interesting.

456
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,710
It's very interesting.
The sound is so.

457
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:30,890
It lasts like it's so relevant.
If you listen to some Zeplin today,

458
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,670
it's still so God damn good.
They were so good.

459
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,660
They were so good.
Solon Zeplin

460
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,503
tool called bring it on home at the end 
he comes out like with a harmonica slow 

461
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,490
than Jimmy page kicks in with the 
guitar.

462
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:49,810
You're not stopped.
Like psyche.

463
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,550
Like I should jump out a window like led
Zepplin too.

464
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,403
There's a couple of albums.
I got that office that I put on such a 

465
00:23:57,651 --> 00:23:58,484
part of my childhood.
I think about my mom coming into the 

466
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:06,131
room saying yelling lower that fucking 
devil music saying weight bias.

467
00:24:06,951 --> 00:24:11,370
I mostly got bar on it and I would blast
it at fucking six.

468
00:24:11,371 --> 00:24:12,540
No morning.
Oh,

469
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,480
the neighbors next door with Jehovah 
witnesses and he would knock on my door.

470
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:20,210
You have to please lower your music.
I never loaded.

471
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,600
Lowered it.
At that age I had a fissure stereo.

472
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,693
Okay.
And I already knew not to get 

473
00:24:26,451 --> 00:24:28,990
components.
Like I was already hit.

474
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,750
Like I never bought the album with the 
eight track and the cassette.

475
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,673
Fuck you.
I bought an amp and I bought on a 

476
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:42,130
cassette deck and I had a turntable and 
I would fucking blasted.

477
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,540
I don't know where I got the speakers 
from.

478
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:46,100
I bought them.
They fell off a truck.

479
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,440
I love music.
Loud my store every time till this day,

480
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,560
every time led zepplins final album 
comes out.

481
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,860
I'm truly outdoor comes on the radio or 
something.

482
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,400
I think of my mother banging on the door
for freshman year going if I got a knock

483
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:04,634
on this door one more time.
I'm throwing that out the window like 

484
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:11,210
seven in the morning.
How does that full fucking speed.

485
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,170
Rolling.
Joining,

486
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,860
getting ready to walk up the hill.
Smoking and joy.

487
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,440
I wouldn't smoke at the house.
Nothing like that.

488
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:21,020
She had no idea.
We play an album albums,

489
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,190
the record player.

490
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,680
Fuck,
I still did you have a good needle?

491
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,210
Memory?
We'd go over to houses,

492
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,240
they had a special needle.
Where'd you go to the NATO?

493
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,300
I just went and got new needles.
I had to order them online.

494
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:40,850
Fucking impressive guy and I got fucking
cool looking needle.

495
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,103
I still had.
I had a friend that had a reel to reel 

496
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,573
Jimmy.
I had a record player in my house for 

497
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:48,530
sure.
Wow.

498
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,960
You gotta reel to reel.
A friend of mine had a real reel in high

499
00:25:51,961 --> 00:25:53,510
school.
Oh my God.

500
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,180
And the sound he bought the speakers and
everything.

501
00:25:56,181 --> 00:26:00,560
He was a sound.
You could hear like the musician pulling

502
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:03,950
away from the microphone.
Like was that good?

503
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,800
So when he's playing this reel to reel,
got like a,

504
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:09,110
like a projector screen type deal?
No,

505
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:10,843
he had a room like this and uh,
he had a shelf and on the shelf he had 

506
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,673
speakers and he had a real real,
I think I've connected and it will have 

507
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,880
two or three hours of music on it.
So whenever he would have a party,

508
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:28,820
he would just put on the reel to reel.
At that time.

509
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:31,940
That was the threat that it's going to 
reel to reel.

510
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,930
That's projector,
right?

511
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,860
It's going to reel to reel.
That's the new threat.

512
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,980
That's never made it.
And then it went from,

513
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:45,040
it went from albums to cassettes to 
fucking cds.

514
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,943
So if you put something through that you
would have to Kinda like do it like you 

515
00:26:49,711 --> 00:26:50,544
were working in the projection room.
You take the magnetic from one of them 

516
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,444
and it works almost.
It's just really large cassette tape 

517
00:26:56,521 --> 00:26:57,354
player.

518
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,250
How he put the music on that.
I forget how he put the music on that.

519
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,860
Could you buy music?
Ah,

520
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,300
I think so.
It is recording

521
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,153
but not ness to it looks like.
So you could have recorded something on 

522
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,880
there if you had a cable to plug it into
it.

523
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,270
I forget how many copies.
Uh,

524
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,343
the same way you'd put your original 
would be like on the left you tend to 

525
00:27:17,131 --> 00:27:17,800
feed it.
You did it.

526
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,633
You'd need a copier.
You couldn't do it with this machine 

527
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:20,604
probably,
but that the same way people did with 

528
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:24,230
VCR copies back in the early eighties,
you know,

529
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,730
tape to tape.
You'd find the same thing,

530
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:31,731
how it would degrade each generation.
You get forms for your friend and it was

531
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,220
like someone threw mud in your eyes.
He tried to watch it.

532
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:36,054
The fuck is happening on the screen 
because it was so many generations of 

533
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:39,174
copied.
Do you remember when porn was wife's 

534
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,280
like this?
I don't remember,

535
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,133
but I heard about it and I remember that
movie about the dude from Hogan's 

536
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:50,010
heroes.
That was a,

537
00:27:50,011 --> 00:27:51,000
uh,
he,

538
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:54,150
he was on Hogan's heroes and after 
hoping his heroes,

539
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:58,820
he just went around making his own 
homemade porn and he,

540
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,630
you know,
he had one of these kinds of things.

541
00:28:00,631 --> 00:28:02,490
When the home projector type deals,

542
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:03,643
porn came in those days.
If you went to the back of a dirty 

543
00:28:07,491 --> 00:28:10,730
magazine,
playboy and Penthouse,

544
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:15,140
but anything else,
they would actually send you a projector

545
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,450
with three movies for say 14,
95.

546
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,710
There was a low end project.
They're probably going to work 10 times,

547
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:29,300
but at least you got to watch porn and 
they'd send you a reel to reel.

548
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:30,883
That was so bad.
Porn was so bad and I still remember a 

549
00:28:36,891 --> 00:28:37,724
story with me and my friends chipping in
and getting the fucking reel to reel 

550
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,343
with the thing and plugging it into the 
wall and putting sheets on the windows 

551
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:54,530
and it was just horrible,
horrible born white chicks.

552
00:28:54,531 --> 00:28:55,364
They would find them off the streets.
Flapjack Teddy's somebody turned 

553
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:03,821
cigarettes off on a chest and this chick
was half on drugs and she had a suck the

554
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,000
guy's Dick in the most vivid picture of 
members.

555
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,020
When she took the mayonnaise with the 
bread,

556
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:10,923
like she was sucking this guy's Dick.
The guy's Dick had been beat up and she 

557
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:17,000
took mayonnaise.
Miracle Whip.

558
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,403
That's why I never liked miracle whip.
She put it on the bread and made a Dick 

559
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,160
Sandwiches.
It was dick and it was like me and three

560
00:29:25,161 --> 00:29:26,660
other 12 year olds,
dog.

561
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:30,650
We almost had a heart attack.
You understand me?

562
00:29:30,651 --> 00:29:31,484
Like our heads blew up.
I tell him who wants this fucking 

563
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,320
project?
No,

564
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:38,751
no,
no,

565
00:29:38,751 --> 00:29:39,111
no,
no,

566
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:39,501
no,
no,

567
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:39,921
no,
no.

568
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:41,890
It was a cheap,
cheap,

569
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,753
cheap little project.
The you had to put a sheet up on the 

570
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:46,084
wall and use it as a screen.
You had a fucking shade up all your 

571
00:29:50,111 --> 00:29:50,944
windows and the addict,
because I used to do it in my attic as 

572
00:29:52,781 --> 00:29:57,070
my mother wasn't home,
so I will let the first viewing party we

573
00:29:57,071 --> 00:30:01,350
had was in my attic.
You had to send the money on and to send

574
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,193
the dollar 95 for shipping and handling 
has an h and then they will take six 

575
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:09,730
weeks to delivery so you would just sit 
and you couldn't send it to your house,

576
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,253
so I would have to send it to Rogan's 
house because I knew his mother and his 

577
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:16,900
grandmother worked all day so they'll 
never be home,

578
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:19,300
so they would just drop the package off 
in front of the house.

579
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,930
If one of our mothers found that 
baggage,

580
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,773
we'd be dead.

581
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,533
We'd be fucking dead.
Can You Imagine Your Mother Checkmate 

582
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,760
with Miracle Whip on a piece of bread 
and eats into the fucking your deck with

583
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,783
you?
Think moms today probably wouldn't even 

584
00:30:34,961 --> 00:30:37,030
flinch.
What if,

585
00:30:37,031 --> 00:30:37,864
what if they found their kid with 
something like that and his complaint 

586
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:41,680
and fucking kidding me.
Every mom.

587
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,873
The edit.
You talked to any mom or a 15 year old 

588
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,080
and go,
do you think your son's getting late?

589
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,860
He's like,
stop it.

590
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,270
I don't want to hear that.
It's true.

591
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,950
No,
mom wants to hear this.

592
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:51,784
I'm getting laid.
The first girl you brought over the 

593
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:57,220
house actually bothered your mother.
Oh,

594
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,073
I'm sure.
The first two girls you brought loom 

595
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:04,030
actually bothered an irritated the Shit 
Outta your mother.

596
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,720
It took your mom awhile because you're 
always going to be that little boy.

597
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,300
I can't imagine him getting his dick 
suck.

598
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:11,290
He just.

599
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:14,560
I just put diapers on 10 years ago.
You know what else they worried about?

600
00:31:14,561 --> 00:31:15,394
They're worried about you getting so 
many pregnant because you're so stupid 

601
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,350
when you're 15,
16,

602
00:31:20,351 --> 00:31:23,440
17.
You guys are just doing stupid shit.

603
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,863
You know?
You don't really know how to pull out 

604
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:28,180
that good.
How good are you at that?

605
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,930
Very good.
When you were that young,

606
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,180
I mean it's.
Your parents are worried about you doing

607
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:38,040
something dumb.
Your parents worried about you.

608
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,650
Getting pregnant,
but they also don't want you having sex.

609
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,163
I had the skinny girl friend,
like I always had girls that were 

610
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:51,370
friends and then after the girls leave,
my mom would pull me aside and said,

611
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:52,330
what's going on?
I go,

612
00:31:52,331 --> 00:31:53,164
nothing.
She's just a friend and I would have 

613
00:31:55,091 --> 00:31:57,070
stayed out of the house.
I can't believe it.

614
00:31:57,071 --> 00:31:58,270
You know,
they were friends,

615
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,580
but that was just one skinny girl.

616
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:01,963
But I used to bring home in the seventh 
grade and my mother caught us one 

617
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,910
afternoon.
She called US making out.

618
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,000
So she asked me as a man.
She goes from now on,

619
00:32:10,001 --> 00:32:13,270
do me a fucking favor.
If she's here and I'm downstairs,

620
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:15,750
just leave the door open.
My mom was one of those dog.

621
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,523
She was one of those.
Just do me a favor just from the Middle 

622
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:24,100
East when I leave and lock the door.
But if I'm here,

623
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,033
just leave the door open and I would 
leave it open the foot and then try to 

624
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,470
eight inches,
six inches and she would have to come up

625
00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:36,240
and say,
I'll tell you with the fucking door open

626
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,530
and then you,
you're an animal at that age.

627
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:39,863
So at that age you for how we talked to 
him yet because all I was doing was dry 

628
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:43,280
humping this girl.

629
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,920
That's all I was doing.
We weren't having sex.

630
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:49,480
I think I sent the one time we weren't 
having sex,

631
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:50,314
we were just making out dry humping.
But one day I had my mom had the bar 

632
00:32:53,901 --> 00:32:58,901
stool and she would just fucking come 
home in the afternoon to see if I was at

633
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:03,650
this broad and one dad in here and she 
brought one up,

634
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:04,484
friends up.
One of her friends were there and I've 

635
00:33:07,591 --> 00:33:09,460
been there just swap and split with the 
chip.

636
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:13,470
But I hear something on the wall.
Something is going on.

637
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,010
But I kept dry humping.
We had earth,

638
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:19,760
wind and fire.
Can I love great fucking arm off.

639
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,653
That's the way of the world.
I'm driving them in this check that you 

640
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:24,860
know,
son,

641
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,693
I hear a lot of slip and the guy starts 
yelling and I ran downstairs and there 

642
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:34,960
was one of my mother's friends.

643
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,510
He used to be a bookie at my mother's 
boss,

644
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,120
so my mother goes,
I gotta get to the bottom of this.

645
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:42,610
I got to know what this kid's getting 
late.

646
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,993
So he volunteers at the ladder,
at the side of the house to see if I'm 

647
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:52,850
getting laid to look in the window.
I had an air conditioner with a curtain.

648
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,693
He could never see it anyway,
but this girl pissed off my mom fie 

649
00:33:58,431 --> 00:34:02,540
years.
This went on for about a year and then I

650
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,374
started taking his shirt off and suck in
attendance and my dad came home when 

651
00:34:07,641 --> 00:34:11,450
they caught him in a closet and that was
the end.

652
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,510
And then my mom would give me shit for a
little while.

653
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,180
I got to be 12,
13.

654
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,083
I'm in the sixth grade.
Me and this girl would watch the 

655
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:20,024
osbournes on Friday and Saturday.
Donny and Marie and I would get pissed 

656
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:25,790
off because she had a crush on fucking 
Donnie.

657
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,980
You're a kid and then one day,
but then we figured out,

658
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:32,460
fuck,
if they're gonna,

659
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,313
watch this after three,
why don't we play Hooky from 12 to 

660
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:37,124
three?
We could dry drive for three hours and 

661
00:34:39,141 --> 00:34:43,100
nobody will know your grandmother works.
My mother is definitely not coming home.

662
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:48,820
So we used to play hooky and one day 
they caught us and her and I had like,

663
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,343
there was 20 feet between us and a fence
that parents had a house right behind 

664
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,853
mine and my mom went into the backyard 
like the fuck in Spanish from and that 

665
00:35:00,411 --> 00:35:01,244
she is and studied yelling.
Your daughter's a hole over here every 

666
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,550
day.
I don't know what they do in that room.

667
00:35:10,551 --> 00:35:13,770
I hope she's not sucking his dick.
My daughter was just.

668
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,893
My son was a regular little boy until 
your daughter took over and I knew I 

669
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:20,980
used to walk home and I remember walking
the house and the mom was like,

670
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,863
I need a second.
Your mom's out there yelling horrible 

671
00:35:24,741 --> 00:35:27,140
things about my daughter called the 
orange.

672
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,900
Wow.
I had to go home and tell my Mama what's

673
00:35:29,901 --> 00:35:33,140
up with that.
She's a fucking whore for the job.

674
00:35:33,141 --> 00:35:33,974
My mom career woman drove by that,
but I got a girlfriend and no more 

675
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:42,390
problems after that.
It was just this skinny chick that drove

676
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:43,860
my motherfucking crazy.

677
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,840
Hey,
they made you bad.

678
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,103
Mean imagine you have a little boy and 
you take them to the park and he's a 

679
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:54,654
cute little fella and he runs and he 
stumbles and falls down and cries and 

680
00:35:57,811 --> 00:36:02,360
you pick them up and he hugs you and you
love him and you're like,

681
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,690
it's okay.
You just scrape your knee.

682
00:36:03,691 --> 00:36:05,580
It's okay,
and he's crying and crying.

683
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:08,040
You feel so bad.
You feel so bad.

684
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:09,443
You get them a bandaid and give him a 
kiss and talk to them and hang out with 

685
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,004
them.
Then he goes to sleep and you sit there 

686
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:17,430
and you look at him sleep and you think 
about how precious he is,

687
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,160
a sort of life form you you're entrusted
with.

688
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:25,161
You've got 15 years later,
someone sucking his dick,

689
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,670
some dirty little girl down the block.
God dammit.

690
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,953
Look at that.
Now he's all endure all the time and 

691
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:35,250
obsessed.
Whether it's driving you nuts.

692
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:40,850
How's your baby?
Your baby stuck with some tramp tramp.

693
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:45,950
You have daughters,
you US dollars,

694
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:48,970
which is a.
that's a hell on earth.

695
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,710
Having a daughter.
It's fun now.

696
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:56,380
It's cute.
She puts costume.

697
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,880
She loves daddy.
She watches TV,

698
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:02,480
but there's an accommodation once to go 
to the mall with her friends.

699
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,403
Yeah,
the letter you have to worry and it's 

700
00:37:05,721 --> 00:37:07,760
not the same world.
So you know,

701
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,403
the world is not the same now and it's 
not going to be the same when they're 

702
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,610
older.
It's getting weirder and weirder.

703
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,230
You know,
people getting,

704
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,423
you know,
we're talking earlier about bugs and 

705
00:37:18,141 --> 00:37:20,780
searches and people being will turn your
microphones on.

706
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:25,700
It has a matter of time before there's 
no privacy.

707
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,210
Whether it's 50 years,
whether it's 100 years.

708
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,840
And I mean I think there's gonna be no 
privacy with anything.

709
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,300
I don't think with your thoughts.
I think we're going to.

710
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:36,583
The next thing after cell phones is 
going to be something that allows us to 

711
00:37:40,671 --> 00:37:43,090
communicate way easier.
They're gonna.

712
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:43,963
There's gonna within the next 50 years.
They're going to come up with some way 

713
00:37:46,461 --> 00:37:49,760
where we're going to be all communicate 
through what device.

714
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,830
It's going to be better than just 
talking.

715
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,260
We're going to.
We're going to share thoughts.

716
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,780
It's going to get really fucking 
strange.

717
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,613
I'm a hundred percent convinced.
I think all of this stuff is just 

718
00:37:59,901 --> 00:38:02,090
getting everything accelerates,
right?

719
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,163
It used to be really hard to get ahold 
of somebody and now it's really easy to 

720
00:38:04,971 --> 00:38:07,380
get ahold of somebody and now you're 
gonna.

721
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,413
People figured out ways to turn people's
microphones on and record them and 

722
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,870
people are putting tape over their 
webcam.

723
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,940
I want you to look at while I'm checking
off like did they think someone's gonna?

724
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,550
Look through it from the other side.
They probably can.

725
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,420
It's going to be a matter of time before
everybody can with everybody,

726
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,880
with everything you do is going to be.
There's going to be all,

727
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:31,010
all information available to everybody.
This is going to happen.

728
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,250
We're so far away from where we were in 
the seventies so far away,

729
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,920
so far away,
so far away and that was our lifetime.

730
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,710
We can remember the seventies,
you know,

731
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,210
1973.

732
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,650
I was six years old.
Okay.

733
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:45,990
I remember that.
I remember,

734
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,013
I remember the Vietnam War.
I remember when the war ended thinking 

735
00:38:49,211 --> 00:38:50,044
when I was a little kid.
This is great that the war is over 

736
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:55,120
because now they know that war is bad 
and they won't do any war anymore.

737
00:38:55,121 --> 00:38:56,500
The war is over.
It's gone.

738
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,930
And then when the war started up again 
when I was,

739
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,610
I think I was 21,
when Desert Storm kicked in,

740
00:39:02,611 --> 00:39:03,820
I was like,
Holy Shit.

741
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:06,070
They're doing it again.
Me and my friend Jimmy,

742
00:39:06,071 --> 00:39:11,071
to tell you we had an apartment in.
Think it was fucking.

743
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,810
Where were we?
Malden or some shit.

744
00:39:13,811 --> 00:39:15,610
I forget where the fuck we were.
Wall Fan.

745
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,260
That's where we were,
were in Waltham.

746
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,130
We had this fucking apartment and uh,
we were sitting there on TV,

747
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:22,990
which is sitting in front of the living 
room.

748
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:23,824
I didn't think we had a couch.
We just sit in there in the living room 

749
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:30,760
watching these fucking missiles flying 
through the air and I'll never forget.

750
00:39:30,761 --> 00:39:32,560
He goes,
buddy looks like we're at war.

751
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,090
And I was like,
what?

752
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,210
How?
They were both sitting there going,

753
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:42,211
what the fuck we're at war.
I thought we didn't do that anymore.

754
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,560
I remember that.
I remember that whole that time when,

755
00:39:50,131 --> 00:39:55,131
when that was how you got information 
from the TV a so far removed from today.

756
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,393
Today,
everything that happens all the time is 

757
00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:03,280
coming at Ya a hundred miles an hour 
from every direction.

758
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:04,114
There's just too much.

759
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:09,340
You have to control it.
You have to control it.

760
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,580
You still have to have a life.
You still,

761
00:40:12,581 --> 00:40:14,740
you know,
I don't have facebook on my phone,

762
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,173
I have my email account.
I try to keep twitter off my phone when 

763
00:40:20,111 --> 00:40:23,080
I go on the road.
The IPAD has no twitter,

764
00:40:23,081 --> 00:40:25,510
no facebook,
it's too much.

765
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,510
It's too much to fee.
Is that who we are?

766
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,870
And if you haven't caught that by now,
you're not catching this.

767
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,293
You know,
I helped open up my twitter on a 

768
00:40:34,961 --> 00:40:39,340
Saturday just to see who's tweet.
Thinking to myself,

769
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,203
what are you doing with your fucking 
life that you had tweeted on Friday and 

770
00:40:44,081 --> 00:40:47,320
fucking Saturday and Sunday.
You know,

771
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,710
it becomes a little game.
It's a little game.

772
00:40:50,711 --> 00:40:54,020
You have to give it a breather.
You have to you.

773
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,670
It's too much news coming at you from 
two.

774
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,160
Oh,
two on your satellite disk.

775
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:01,363
It's,
it's too much news from sports to World 

776
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,520
News.
You Got Hln,

777
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:12,040
CNN,
and then espn all of the fucking row.

778
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,950
It's too fast.
It's too quick.

779
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:17,440
Last week when I was home,
my buddy,

780
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,480
uh,
as a cab driver,

781
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,380
I took six.
Uber's on Monday in New York.

782
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:27,670
Tuesday I just wanted to take a cab.
I took my wife to get some real pizza.

783
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,533
Roma Pizza.
The guy that was making pizza that was 

784
00:41:30,671 --> 00:41:33,700
still there when I was a kid.
I drove by one day and I go,

785
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:34,563
he's still in there,
so we took a fucking cab on the cat and 

786
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:40,460
this guy that drove me as a friend of 
mine,

787
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:43,780
we grew up together since we were 12 and
we were talking.

788
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,633
I go,
that's the fast first gas station that 

789
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,810
robbed.
And then it goes.

790
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,300
Remember when we were 12?
We were walking home and I,

791
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:51,650
Freddy Prince got killed.

792
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,290
Wow.
Freddy Prince.

793
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:58,300
That killed himself the name before.
We didn't find out till that 6:00

794
00:41:58,371 --> 00:42:01,010
news.
Do you know what I'm saying?

795
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,920
Yeah.
That was the gap in time.

796
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,053
So you got your news and even though 
that was New York was the city capital 

797
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,233
who watch tv in the morning,
maybe they mentioned it in the morning 

798
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,660
reports out of La.
Freddy in hospital.

799
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,890
Yeah.
But you never saw it,

800
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,010
but no,
I,

801
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:25,330
I remember us being out and them saying 
Freddy Prince died.

802
00:42:25,731 --> 00:42:29,810
He shot himself last night and I still 
remember how cold it was,

803
00:42:29,811 --> 00:42:33,320
January or February.
It was fucking freezing,

804
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:34,603
but we were walking home.
We were 12 and what do we see in front 

805
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:39,890
of this guy?
Passed out drunk.

806
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,810
Just hammered drunk on the floor.
So we're like,

807
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,770
let's get the money out of his pocket.
You take the bottle.

808
00:42:47,771 --> 00:42:49,910
It was like a bottle of dewar's or 
whatever.

809
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,000
So our plan was to take a bottle and 
shake a bum.

810
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:53,840
What?
What's it called?

811
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:57,590
You roll a bum and we put our hands in 
his pocket.

812
00:42:57,591 --> 00:42:58,424
He grabbed one of us like Gary.
So next they don't have to realize it's 

813
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:02,183
just started kicking him like we must 
have kicked the maybe two times and we 

814
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:12,420
ran away the bottle.
You gotta be chases Jesus shirt,

815
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,410
pet cemetery.
So we lost them.

816
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:19,890
Like you get all those weird things like
that's what I associate with like Freddy

817
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:21,583
Shadow himself at night.
They must have mentioned it in the 

818
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:24,584
morning.
I was too busy going to school and it 

819
00:43:26,631 --> 00:43:31,631
wasn't confirmed until the next day.
That's how slow new was.

820
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,013
Now you're getting news.
You get hit with 200 stories in 10 

821
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:40,400
minutes.
What happened in prints?

822
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:44,240
What trump decided what the UFC is 
doing.

823
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:49,750
What fucking Penny Marshall died.
You get natural all day.

824
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,340
You really can't control it.
Take your child.

825
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,130
You've watched these two young girls 
grow up.

826
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:58,420
Do you ever have days where you take 
them somewhere?

827
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,740
Disney and it's so much information 
they've got to go back.

828
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,740
I'm thinking that yeah,
it happens to us.

829
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,710
Yeah.
That's got to be happening to us.

830
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:14,030
Well for sure it's wearing you out and 
it's a lot of it is really negative too.

831
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:15,913
That's another part of the problem is 
what's interesting to people is what's 

832
00:44:18,351 --> 00:44:20,090
dangerous and there's not much 
dangerous,

833
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:25,250
so what's interesting to people becomes 
being negative,

834
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,370
being nasty about something,
complaining about things,

835
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:29,243
bitching about that,
starting starting twitter fights like 

836
00:44:31,651 --> 00:44:32,010
people

837
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:32,843
enjoy doing it,
they're like they're looking for for 

838
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:35,844
battles.
I wished there was a way where people 

839
00:44:39,391 --> 00:44:44,391
could choose to only engage online 
without insulting people and just trying

840
00:44:46,531 --> 00:44:50,610
to get a rise out of people like a troll
free way of interacting,

841
00:44:50,611 --> 00:44:51,444
but it's never going to happen.
So you got to kind of accept what it is 

842
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:55,290
is.
So if you accept what it is,

843
00:44:55,770 --> 00:45:00,630
you should be very wary about entering 
to anything.

844
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:03,300
We're 60 percent of what you're 
experiencing is negative.

845
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,780
Anything,
anything in life where you're looking at

846
00:45:06,781 --> 00:45:09,410
60 percent negative,
you don't have to do it.

847
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,320
Like being informed is one thing,
but that's more than just being informed

848
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,750
because how much of that information is 
even valuable to you?

849
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,153
A lot of it is just getting soaked,
soaked into these fucking horrible 

850
00:45:20,161 --> 00:45:22,230
stories.
You know what I mean?

851
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,083
I,
I went down a rabbit hole the other day 

852
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:24,680
reading about this,
uh,

853
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:29,160
these Scandinavian tourists that got 
beheaded in Morocco,

854
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:32,590
in the mountains.
These girls were hitchhiking and went,

855
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:34,320
it's fucking horrible.
It's horrible,

856
00:45:34,321 --> 00:45:35,300
horrible stuff.
Matt.

857
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:38,550
And then I watched a video of it.
It's horrible

858
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:39,680
showroom.
And you know,

859
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,010
I love your room.
Number one,

860
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:44,590
logo headshot going to Morocco.
Mind your fucking business.

861
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:47,050
Girls apparently did this all over the 
world.

862
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,473
Either you're talking about a guy that 
fucking went somewhere and tried to 

863
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:55,630
convert a tribe.
They showed up with a fucking Bible.

864
00:45:55,670 --> 00:46:00,100
You Mind Your Business?
So I send the fucking Bible via mail and

865
00:46:00,101 --> 00:46:00,934
do the best you can.
Some people will want to put themselves 

866
00:46:02,891 --> 00:46:06,850
in danger's way.
They fucking hate that shit.

867
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:11,500
I fucking hate all that shit.
I like controlling my situation.

868
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:14,980
I really do.
I don't want to sound shallow.

869
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:16,203
I would love to be able to have a 
passport and go to China and go to 

870
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,560
Italy,
but I'm not going nowhere.

871
00:46:20,561 --> 00:46:23,080
Whether there's nothing fucking crazy 
going on.

872
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:24,550
I don't need that in my life,
right?

873
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:28,140
I don't want to hear a bomb when I'm 
fucking sleep and when I'm in Israel,

874
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,660
talked to her the other day.

875
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:34,430
You gave bombs going off telling me 
jokes on the phone.

876
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:40,100
You can hear a bomb going off and shit,
I don't need that.

877
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:42,970
I don't need none of that shit that's 
putting yourself in harm's way,

878
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:47,410
you know,
and I appreciate the balls.

879
00:46:47,411 --> 00:46:49,030
I appreciate them.
Balls.

880
00:46:49,031 --> 00:46:53,440
Are you climbing a mountain agero?
I appreciate all that stuff,

881
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,850
but it's not in my percentage graph.
I believe in percentages.

882
00:46:57,851 --> 00:46:59,470
You understand me?
I get it.

883
00:46:59,471 --> 00:47:04,471
So it's just the other night I read to.
I get high at night guys.

884
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:11,590
I do comedy and to come down I smoke 55 
fucking Bong hits.

885
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,700
Sometimes you don't have to say a joke 
on twitter.

886
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,630
The joke is written when you read it as 
a human being,

887
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:22,630
you're saying this is a very interesting
article,

888
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,360
but at the same time it does have 
elements of humor in it.

889
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:29,320
There's an article of a hot chick and 
then it says,

890
00:47:29,321 --> 00:47:30,154
mother goes to court to complain about a
teacher who fucked a 15 year old kid 

891
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:40,690
because his life has changed,
has never been the same since she fucked

892
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,020
him.

893
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:43,720
Show it as the kid's never going to get 
his dick.

894
00:47:43,721 --> 00:47:44,554
Suck like that again.
Can you imagine getting a teacher to 

895
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:48,850
blow your horn when you're in high 
school?

896
00:47:48,851 --> 00:47:49,684
One of those dirty teeth.
See a picture of a Joe Rogan with a 

897
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:52,244
fresh and a boat with a bikini.
Now you take this chick to the prom and 

898
00:47:56,321 --> 00:47:57,820
she sucking your Dick,
Ryan.

899
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,021
You know what I'm saying?
Like,

900
00:47:59,021 --> 00:48:00,940
I've never done this before.
You know what I'm saying?

901
00:48:00,941 --> 00:48:03,730
Like reluctant.
His life is changed.

902
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:05,063
It's a joke dog.
I got to attack the two days and I 

903
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:12,040
didn't reattach people.
I turned it around on them.

904
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:14,320
I called them love.
Listen,

905
00:48:14,321 --> 00:48:17,380
Merry Christmas,
and they had no where to go.

906
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:21,130
It's so funny that you could get caught 
in that.

907
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,240
They forget what Comedians we are a a 
tube,

908
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:31,020
a tube that transport something really 
ugly into something that's still ugly,

909
00:48:31,481 --> 00:48:32,740
but a little bit of funny to it.

910
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:36,730
I cracked a joke when I found my mother 
dead on the floor to myself,

911
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:40,210
which I knew she was never going to 
know.

912
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,133
I got left back because I got back,
but I never told and it was coming on a 

913
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,570
year.
I had a tower.

914
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,710
She was.
She kept asking me,

915
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:48,573
have you chosen to college yet?
And I'm a sophomore year for three 

916
00:48:51,851 --> 00:48:53,530
years.
I ran the scam of my mother.

917
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:57,640
I had that.
I tell her she thought I was a junior.

918
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:02,530
I was a sophomore,
so as soon as I made that turn,

919
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:05,650
I picked her up.
I saw arm was purple.

920
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,950
I kissed her forehead,
but I remember popping up and going.

921
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:14,020
I knew this wasn't going to have a fund 
that I before.

922
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:17,980
I dial nine one one.
So if I dropped humor at that situation,

923
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,010
that's how I fucking handle myself.
Well,

924
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:22,770
that's how you.
Yeah,

925
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:27,190
you have to drop you.
I will drop a bomb on you at a funeral.

926
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,153
Joe Rogan,
I will drop a bomb on you and that you 

927
00:49:31,931 --> 00:49:34,370
will look at me and go,
God is the balls on you,

928
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:37,120
but thank God you came every time with 
Dave always said,

929
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:41,260
when Phil Hartman didn't win an emmy,
what we were all in the audience,

930
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:42,103
right?
Went there to honor him because he got 

931
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:48,600
nominated and the dude from Frasier,
one day he turns to me and Steven.

932
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:51,890
Rudy goes,
what the hell did you have to do to win?

933
00:49:55,930 --> 00:50:00,930
He goes,
he got shot for fuck sake.

934
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:07,060
Foley's a funny way.
If I really is,

935
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:08,373
people have no idea.
When I see people arguing now like now 

936
00:50:12,931 --> 00:50:16,390
as a 55 year old,
you look at it and you go,

937
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:21,130
I threw away 20 years of my life.
Are you with people that I had no reason

938
00:50:21,131 --> 00:50:24,220
to argue with them for it's not even 
worth it.

939
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:25,054
If they played the tape back,
you'd laugh at yourself and feel 

940
00:50:27,531 --> 00:50:28,364
horrible.

941
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:30,680
You look at Shit now you go,
what is.

942
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:36,220
How does this even affect your life?
I want so CNN,

943
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,840
like when you're in a hotel room on the 
weekends,

944
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:44,750
you go down and CNN or see hsbc 
political pipe hole.

945
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,533
Oh,
I love those for six minutes to see 

946
00:50:48,891 --> 00:50:52,480
people get fired up and they attack each
other and you know,

947
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:56,150
and everybody's fucking bullshit,
but you sit there and you go,

948
00:50:56,151 --> 00:50:56,984
what is the big fucking deal?
No matter if hit what makes a comeback 

949
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:04,280
and he's president.
You all got to get up and go to work.

950
00:51:04,281 --> 00:51:07,610
Every morning is giving your money 
anymore.

951
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:10,340
It's not like somebody giving you money 
or they're pointing you in the house for

952
00:51:10,341 --> 00:51:13,760
free.
If it Dell resurfaces from the grave,

953
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:16,460
he is the president.
You still gotta work.

954
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,160
You still gotta build houses.
You still got announce the UFC.

955
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:22,580
You're still so what?

956
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:25,250
What?
How much does it really affect you at?

957
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:26,143
At least that's how I've always thought.
The problem with all these shows is all 

958
00:51:29,901 --> 00:51:31,910
of them,
whether it's CNN or Fox News,

959
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,370
is that they're leaning.
They're leaning in somewhere.

960
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,890
The lean in one there,
they're telling you about the news,

961
00:51:36,891 --> 00:51:37,724
but they're leaning on it in a way.
They're not just simply recording the 

962
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,800
facts,
especially Fox News.

963
00:51:42,801 --> 00:51:44,300
Right?
They lean like,

964
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:45,163
I don't know.
I don't know what you guys are talking 

965
00:51:47,301 --> 00:51:49,190
about when you say that,
but I will tell you.

966
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:50,623
Yeah.
When people talk to me about left and 

967
00:51:51,771 --> 00:51:54,650
right,
I have no idea because I don't even know

968
00:51:54,651 --> 00:51:59,651
where I stand on most issues,
but guess what I did see in New York and

969
00:52:00,021 --> 00:52:00,854
New Jersey last week take a guess of 
what I did not see homeless people 

970
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:09,290
really like because it's so cold.

971
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:15,260
I was homeless for Nineteen Days in New 
York in December,

972
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:16,163
December twelfth through the 30.
First I got a hotel room maybe 50 

973
00:52:18,651 --> 00:52:19,484
percent of the time,
but besides that I was homeless at one 

974
00:52:22,221 --> 00:52:26,800
time in 1984.
Usually I ask people and you say,

975
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:28,873
hmm.
I saw very small sections of not 

976
00:52:32,411 --> 00:52:33,244
encampments,
but homeless present percentage was 

977
00:52:36,501 --> 00:52:39,350
smaller,
so I asked somebody what that is.

978
00:52:39,351 --> 00:52:41,480
How come I have somebody homeless people
out here?

979
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:44,360
They said it's was because they're 
liberals.

980
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:47,270
I didn't fucking know that's what 
liberal was.

981
00:52:47,271 --> 00:52:48,490
I had no idea.
I mean,

982
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:51,170
California is liberal.
I just try to be a human being.

983
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,030
I don't know.
That doesn't make sense.

984
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:54,000
It's like,
what does that mean?

985
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:57,200
Then what were the homeless go?
Do we make more of them out here?

986
00:52:57,201 --> 00:53:00,750
Is that what he's saying?
Do you allow it to Las Vegas?

987
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,500
He was telling me that Las Vegas ships,
they're homeless,

988
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:08,790
scares them a bus to California and I 
went to the ship.

989
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,153
I feel like the shipping is about 
busting people like Alaska for a little 

990
00:53:12,381 --> 00:53:13,920
while or something like that.
A couple of years.

991
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:19,790
You saw the TV show wild wild country.
Do you see that?

992
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,020
It's on the niche is that I said rag 
niche,

993
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,240
a cult from

994
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,410
Oregon and uh,
one of the things they did to,

995
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:34,430
they took over the town,
all heard about it and watched it.

996
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:38,330
Homeless people in buses and then how 
all those people vote.

997
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:41,450
And then they took over the fucking 
town.

998
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:46,010
They're like developed a real town.
And then they took over this one area of

999
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:48,230
bust out how America moves.
It's homelessness.

1000
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,093
Whoa.
Each year us city gives thousands of 

1001
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:51,794
homeless people one way bus tickets out 
of town and 18 month Nathan nationwide 

1002
00:53:54,951 --> 00:53:55,784
investigation,
but the Guardian reveals for the first 

1003
00:53:57,141 --> 00:53:59,450
time what really happens at journey's 
end.

1004
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:01,063
Whoa.
That sounds like a m night Shyamalan 

1005
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:04,130
movie,
right?

1006
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:07,700
That kill a bunch of homeless people 
like Satan's involved.

1007
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:15,590
It's like they just move them away.
What do they sit where they ship them?

1008
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:17,480
I don't know.

1009
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,100
Looks like they're throwing them down in
Miami and in La.

1010
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,030
Well,
lives in Colorado.

1011
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,970
In Colorado.
People would.

1012
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,313
The homeless people would commit crimes.
They figured out what crimes they would 

1013
00:54:35,431 --> 00:54:40,431
get 60 days for and they would commit 
that crime,

1014
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,073
plead guilty.
Do the 60 days just to get a little 

1015
00:54:44,331 --> 00:54:49,160
winter because in those days boulder 
would give you tobacco.

1016
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,930
You were allowed.
They will give you tobacco,

1017
00:54:52,931 --> 00:54:57,931
but you had a role in that Boulder 
County jail in 1991,

1018
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,393
Boulder County jail and some other jail.
We're voted number one and two jails in 

1019
00:55:04,811 --> 00:55:06,820
the country.
Wow.

1020
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:07,863
That people would want to go to those 
jails and bold the built the new jail 

1021
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:16,070
and it became fucking commy this land 
like Aspen Cardenas land.

1022
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,590
Yeah,
like no cigarettes.

1023
00:55:17,591 --> 00:55:18,424
Everybody had to wear uniforms no more.
Staying up till two in the morning when 

1024
00:55:22,301 --> 00:55:25,180
I was wrong the other way.
Boulder County jail the way.

1025
00:55:25,181 --> 00:55:26,440
What was the good way?
Oh,

1026
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:29,320
county jail was a paradise,
but what was wrong with that?

1027
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:33,320
It got out.
It got out that it was too nice.

1028
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:34,663
So like I'm telling you,
homeless people will commit a crime to 

1029
00:55:36,381 --> 00:55:37,310
do 60 days.

1030
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,233
Can I ask you something?
As a person who's been in jail that 

1031
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:43,940
would it motivate you more?
This is an honest question.

1032
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:44,803
Would it motivate you more if you were 
in jail and it was nice and comfortable 

1033
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:49,124
in there and you got to relax and calm 
down or would it motivate you more if 

1034
00:55:52,371 --> 00:55:53,204
they brought you into some communist 
type jail as you described it with 

1035
00:55:55,551 --> 00:55:56,810
everybody.
I'd wear uniforms there.

1036
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,820
No cigarettes.
There was no fun.

1037
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:03,290
They limited your outside time,
but when I did them both,

1038
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:04,873
what would.
What I think is a person who's been 

1039
00:56:06,501 --> 00:56:09,320
through what would be most effective in 
rehabilitating you?

1040
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:13,211
I mean,
that's the idea,

1041
00:56:13,211 --> 00:56:16,550
right and rehabilitative right now.
You said to me,

1042
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:20,380
you gotta stay this fucking building for
six months.

1043
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:24,040
This is going to be a jail.
Is like Pablo jail.

1044
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:26,343
It's still jail.
I want you to remember that you can not 

1045
00:56:29,861 --> 00:56:34,180
leave the building for six months.
I will let you go out to the front and a

1046
00:56:34,181 --> 00:56:35,014
cage one hour a day,
but you got to figure out what you're 

1047
00:56:39,131 --> 00:56:41,440
going to do in a for 12 months.
It's a cage.

1048
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:43,630
Yes.
I have more options here.

1049
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:46,150
I can lift weights.
I do different parts of my body.

1050
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:47,890
I could shoot pool,
blah,

1051
00:56:47,891 --> 00:56:48,131
blah,
blah,

1052
00:56:48,131 --> 00:56:48,401
blah,
blah,

1053
00:56:48,401 --> 00:56:50,800
blah.
Boulder was very simple.

1054
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:54,310
Boldly got locked up.
They gave you lemons.

1055
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:57,820
You either took them away.
Not only at my own clothes.

1056
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:02,470
So you called home at lunchtime.
Joe Rogan brought me my jeans,

1057
00:57:02,471 --> 00:57:04,090
my sneakers,
my tee shirts.

1058
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,463
I'm wearing my own clothes.
So now they determined what you're in 

1059
00:57:08,621 --> 00:57:10,510
for.
Nonviolent and violent.

1060
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:15,190
If you're a nonviolent defender,
you the world is yours.

1061
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,473
The violent ones,
the ones that get lumped in with the 

1062
00:57:17,651 --> 00:57:18,640
other ones.

1063
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:21,820
So now the violent offenders,
uh,

1064
00:57:21,821 --> 00:57:26,821
depending on what you do as violent,
you go into one sector and that sector,

1065
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,060
the longer you're in there in,
the more rewards you get.

1066
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,633
So if you're in green,
you stay up till 10 and they got cable 

1067
00:57:35,591 --> 00:57:38,340
TV.
If you are red,

1068
00:57:38,341 --> 00:57:42,010
you stay up till 11 and they ain't got 
cable TV.

1069
00:57:42,011 --> 00:57:43,870
If you're purple,
you stepped on one.

1070
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,670
One Am.
Oh my God.

1071
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:50,700
Boulder County jail was tremendous.
So I figured I didn't drink milk.

1072
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:55,150
Milk is big in jail because the 
bodybuilders like milk.

1073
00:57:55,151 --> 00:58:00,151
It's like fucking drugs.
So I would trade you and you my milk for

1074
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:03,060
your Koolaid.
Right?

1075
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:07,760
So I was in there drinking fucking cool 
shit because I fucking hate.

1076
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:09,783
Boulder was a paradise compared to other
jails all listen to this thanksgiving 

1077
00:58:14,651 --> 00:58:16,150
day when I was.
I locked up.

1078
00:58:16,151 --> 00:58:16,984
Thanks every day at the guard came in 
and I'll never forget his name was ron 

1079
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:22,533
and he opened up the cell door and there
was a phone that was anybody who needs 

1080
00:58:26,261 --> 00:58:27,820
to use the phone,
use the phone.

1081
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:29,343
I figured out,
you know those days you had to press 

1082
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:31,603
mind that sideline.
I pressed eight to see if I get long 

1083
00:58:34,991 --> 00:58:36,820
distance.
Not that press seven,

1084
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:41,970
six,
five for a fucking long business.

1085
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:45,580
I got the call my peoples in Jersey for 
20 minutes a piece,

1086
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:48,910
you know,
you just figure out different things.

1087
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:54,450
Then they send you to a place where 
somebody Lucia and stripped down and you

1088
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,704
got to go take a shower.
Then you come out and they put a finger 

1089
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:03,661
up your ass to see if that's contraband.
They give you a tidy whities and orange,

1090
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:07,990
like a rubber glove on and then loop 
their finger up.

1091
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:11,120
It doesn't matter at that point.
I didn't give a fuck.

1092
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:15,970
You putting the finger up my ass.
It breaks you down with a man as much as

1093
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:17,600
anything in the world.
That's the first break.

1094
00:59:17,601 --> 00:59:18,730
Now.
Wow.

1095
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:20,680
The turn you around to let you go.

1096
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,580
They you,
they going to stick it up your ass.

1097
00:59:23,581 --> 00:59:27,710
Then you go to Esl and those guys there 
and are very nice.

1098
00:59:27,711 --> 00:59:29,810
They weren't like the Boulder County 
jail guys.

1099
00:59:29,811 --> 00:59:32,990
Those guys would shake your bed and make
you get up,

1100
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:36,770
turn your light on in the middle of the 
night and say,

1101
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:39,830
get out of bed.
We're going to do a search at two in the

1102
00:59:39,831 --> 00:59:42,320
morning.
Those people are not nice at all.

1103
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,230
Then I got transferred to Summit County 
jail,

1104
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:50,540
which was a fucking paradise.
Paradise.

1105
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:52,423
Paralyze handball all day outside TV 
till two in the morning using your cell 

1106
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:02,570
black and white tvs and yourself.
Basic cable.

1107
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:06,570
You could be up all night if you wanted 
to go to breakfast,

1108
01:00:06,571 --> 01:00:07,404
you ate breakfast,
not you could sleep through breakfast 

1109
01:00:09,921 --> 01:00:10,754
and we'd eat your breakfast for you.
And then from there they shipped me off 

1110
01:00:13,761 --> 01:00:17,480
to the Department of corrections.
That's where it's the nitty gritty.

1111
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:21,200
You think black people talking to a 
movie theater at night.

1112
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:22,970
Don't go there.

1113
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:29,150
Don't go that black people talk all 
night.

1114
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:30,493
It's six or seven floors and I was in 
there in August with the full humidity 

1115
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:37,400
canyon city,
Colorado.

1116
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:38,740
Wow.
Alright.

1117
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:40,520
Well a little window,
you know,

1118
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:43,040
and I was like on the third floor I 
couldn't read.

1119
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:45,970
And in those days they let.
Yeah,

1120
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,970
you can push hours a week and one hour a
day.

1121
01:00:49,971 --> 01:00:50,804
You went outside after that you were 
just in a cell by yourself at night or 

1122
01:00:56,581 --> 01:00:57,414
froze in the daytime.
It was like fucking been sweating in a 

1123
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:03,010
fucking 10,
10,

1124
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:08,300
10 cans and the data that way finished 
name Charles Shit has nothing to showers

1125
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,533
and then the three meals and then that 
and then the first week is good because 

1126
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:22,250
you actually get out of your salad,
go test.

1127
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,180
They tested everything.
Your math,

1128
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:29,420
your English,
they park and put a bunch of pictures in

1129
01:01:29,421 --> 01:01:31,610
front of you and they put you to 
psychiatry.

1130
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,133
They take your blood out,
they do everything and then they assess 

1131
01:01:36,291 --> 01:01:40,850
you and then they have.
I took care of all of the dots.

1132
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:42,980
Okay.
There's a bunch of dots.

1133
01:01:42,981 --> 01:01:43,814
You have to.
You have to dot your i's like if you 

1134
01:01:46,671 --> 01:01:49,100
have a high school diploma,
you get a point.

1135
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:51,050
If you were working at the time of 
arrest,

1136
01:01:51,051 --> 01:01:54,620
you get a point if you up to paying 
rent,

1137
01:01:54,621 --> 01:01:55,454
so I got a bunch of points for that.
It's so funny out to to talk about 

1138
01:01:59,421 --> 01:02:00,254
something very interesting.
It's very interesting where this Harvey 

1139
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:05,023
Weinstein case is going to go.
It's very interesting where it's going 

1140
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:09,854
to go right now.
He has Benjamin Braf is an attorney and 

1141
01:02:13,761 --> 01:02:18,050
if you see what happened,
Benjamin Bratt push for dismissal and he

1142
01:02:18,051 --> 01:02:20,190
didn't get it.
Lawyer

1143
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:23,540
said the judge set a trial date,
date,

1144
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:24,983
date,
Harvey Weinstein's going to go through 

1145
01:02:26,511 --> 01:02:31,470
them more money to pay off time 
obviously to go for time.

1146
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:36,870
That is going to fire Benjamin,
Braf and show up with two women,

1147
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:38,933
primarily one black and one Asian or one
white and one Asian and this is when 

1148
01:02:45,601 --> 01:02:46,530
this trouser,
and again,

1149
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:47,453
very interesting.
Harvey's also in the higher millions of 

1150
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:56,780
dollars and prosecutor and a private 
investigator's interview boyfriends.

1151
01:02:57,670 --> 01:03:01,530
They're going to interview this case.
It would be very interesting on like the

1152
01:03:01,531 --> 01:03:04,650
cosby case which caused me.
They've been really,

1153
01:03:04,651 --> 01:03:05,484
fuck.
How do you know he's going to do all 

1154
01:03:05,881 --> 01:03:08,430
this stuff because I know this is what I
would do.

1155
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:15,690
I know if you come to me and you go,
I'm getting busted for this.

1156
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:16,543
What do I do?
Because of how I grew up around those 

1157
01:03:19,141 --> 01:03:20,400
people.
This is what you do.

1158
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:24,390
Benjamin Bratt cannot ask a woman the 
same question.

1159
01:03:24,391 --> 01:03:25,680
A woman could ask a woman,

1160
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:28,003
hm,

1161
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,250
so I'm going to go in there with either 
a black woman,

1162
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:33,140
Asian woman,

1163
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:37,170
or a white woman.
My first two choices,

1164
01:03:37,171 --> 01:03:38,004
or a black and an Asian woman.
You want to get the diversity angle to 

1165
01:03:40,741 --> 01:03:42,660
get the diversity angle and I want to 
get that.

1166
01:03:42,661 --> 01:03:43,494
You can't.
You're saying that because you're a 

1167
01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:45,900
black woman.
Chinese woman.

1168
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,550
What?
I'm trying to stare at me.

1169
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:51,840
Did you ever really watched the people 
versus Oj Simpson?

1170
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:52,703
No,
I didn't.

1171
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:55,740
Very interesting.
And it's time that you sat.

1172
01:03:55,741 --> 01:04:00,330
Now the holidays,
the effects version.

1173
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:02,190
I watched one episode and seemed very 
good.

1174
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:04,920
Very interesting.
How he pulled a dream team together.

1175
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:08,430
How it's going to cost you 10 mil.
Listen to me.

1176
01:04:08,431 --> 01:04:10,080
Gee,
you got two options.

1177
01:04:10,081 --> 01:04:10,914
You go in there like cars being paid two
mil and make believe you're blind or we 

1178
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,670
put together a fuck it.
Then you see him.

1179
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:20,370
He wasn't there with that Milky Shit 
over his eyes.

1180
01:04:20,371 --> 01:04:21,560
Like the guy from confo.

1181
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:22,860
Let me.
When we were kids,

1182
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:27,330
foods father followed was like APP blind
and shit.

1183
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,270
Yeah,
I remember that.

1184
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:29,123
Build the Magnesia design shit.
That's how be willing to playing like 

1185
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:33,780
I'm sick.
Routine.

1186
01:04:33,781 --> 01:04:36,850
He's got cataracts.
Who cosby?

1187
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,180
Yeah,
but he didn't have cataracts when he was

1188
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:42,480
like that.
When he put the pill in the water,

1189
01:04:42,481 --> 01:04:43,330
he didn't know.
He knows what.

1190
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,000
He knows what the fucking.
So three steps.

1191
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:47,490
Read your fucking,
you know?

1192
01:04:47,491 --> 01:04:48,450
Yeah,
he knows,

1193
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:53,930
but harvey has to play this hand.
This is what America is about to watch.

1194
01:04:53,941 --> 01:04:55,770
They're going to watch something fucking
crazy.

1195
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:58,240
He probably knows.
He can't go in there.

1196
01:04:58,241 --> 01:04:59,980
And Benjamin Bratt.
Benjamin Bratt.

1197
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,460
Fag gravano.
Look at the list of Benjamin Bratt.

1198
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:06,450
Says Benjamin Braf can attack a woman 
show.

1199
01:05:06,451 --> 01:05:11,451
You look at law legal cases like 
supports on paper.

1200
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:17,110
Listen to John Jones versus Gustafson.
I went to New York last week

1201
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,100
and I went to the Metropolitan Museum of
art with my daughter.

1202
01:05:21,101 --> 01:05:25,570
She loves art and while I was sitting 
there I was added saying,

1203
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,553
go on your own.
Because my daughter didn't want me 

1204
01:05:28,751 --> 01:05:30,820
taking pictures in front of the statutes
anyway.

1205
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:31,991
She's like,
Daddy,

1206
01:05:31,991 --> 01:05:33,730
get out of the pictures of the stash,
so I'm like,

1207
01:05:33,731 --> 01:05:35,320
what the fuck am I hanging out with you 
for?

1208
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:38,700
She was in the Chinese bringing.
I wanted to see the Armenian way,

1209
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:40,713
but it was funny.
I was thinking about when I was 21 and 

1210
01:05:42,761 --> 01:05:43,594
22 Joe Rogan,
I would get stoned to the gills and go 

1211
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:48,844
to the Museum of Natural History of the 
museum or my hobbies back then since I 

1212
01:05:53,111 --> 01:05:55,420
was such a loan and then people looking 
for me,

1213
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:56,293
I was always a criminal.
I would go over the bridge to either go 

1214
01:05:59,351 --> 01:06:02,680
to one of those museums.
While I would sit in the courtroom,

1215
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:08,940
I would go to a place that had a fucking
Italian sandwich and I get a bag of wise

1216
01:06:09,251 --> 01:06:13,510
potato chips in the 16 ounce coke and 
you go to any court room.

1217
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:17,110
Court starts at seven at the 
metropolitan downtown.

1218
01:06:17,111 --> 01:06:21,310
I take the a train and I'd walk.
I forget now what you know.

1219
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,193
This is 1983 81.
I was a kid and I would sit none 

1220
01:06:25,811 --> 01:06:26,860
observed night.

1221
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,200
I learned how to.
Plus I grew up in that.

1222
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:35,220
You were what you would sit and watch 
night court,

1223
01:06:35,221 --> 01:06:40,080
like you'd watch a basketball game,
like a pickup game with a sandwich and a

1224
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:40,933
soda and potato chips.
I think a lot of people don't realize 

1225
01:06:43,141 --> 01:06:45,410
you could just go to court and I would 
want to do that.

1226
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:50,420
12 people I would learn how to set back.
Can you do that anytime you walk and you

1227
01:06:50,731 --> 01:06:53,340
just get in there and watch and then in 
the eighties?

1228
01:06:53,341 --> 01:06:54,950
Yes.
Now this bomb detectors,

1229
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,970
you have that the reason why you're 
there.

1230
01:06:57,150 --> 01:07:00,360
Do you have to like if you're interested
in the case?

1231
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:03,120
Yeah,
he'd go down there and just watch it.

1232
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,920
If you,
for whatever reason,

1233
01:07:04,921 --> 01:07:05,754
there's a speeding thing.
Like someone lost her license and they 

1234
01:07:08,131 --> 01:07:08,964
got arrested driving and trying to get 
away from cops or you can go watch that 

1235
01:07:11,631 --> 01:07:15,120
and go get them support and Joe,
I'd like to go and see.

1236
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,073
I would like to see what the fuck was 
going on when those guys are trying to 

1237
01:07:19,231 --> 01:07:20,064
get away from the cops,
helicopters chasing them with the 

1238
01:07:21,331 --> 01:07:25,260
spotlights and they just keep going.
Like what the fuck were you thinking?

1239
01:07:25,261 --> 01:07:26,094
Like what?
I would like to get to that courtroom 

1240
01:07:28,171 --> 01:07:29,430
hearing.
I want to see that guy.

1241
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:31,920
I'm going to look at that guy that was 
running from the cops.

1242
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:32,843
Fucking spotlight from the helicopter on
me knew he wasn't going to get away and 

1243
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:37,850
he's cutting people off and driving the 
fucking side of the.

1244
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:41,460
Nobody ever gets away.
Has anybody ever gotten away recently?

1245
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:43,653
Something that parking garage.
I couldn't find them in a parking 

1246
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:48,510
garage.
They get away with the percentages.

1247
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:52,440
What?
The percentages are very fucking low.

1248
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:54,450
It's tough to get away,
bro.

1249
01:07:54,451 --> 01:07:55,284
They got you.
Once those helicopter spot you running 

1250
01:07:57,631 --> 01:07:58,464
through neighborhoods,
you've got to make sure you're going 

1251
01:08:00,391 --> 01:08:02,640
into a mall.
They have cameras.

1252
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:04,770
They can rewind the cameras and watch 
you go.

1253
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:09,000
If you're running into the mall and you 
know there he is a spot on the card.

1254
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:12,840
What happened here?
You want to know what happens here?

1255
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:13,830
What happens to.
All right?

1256
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:16,130
First of all,
usually spikes.

1257
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:19,420
Skyline is following you,
so yeah,

1258
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:21,590
they got to put you on the floor,
kick your legs,

1259
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:22,933
do everything by procedure on camera,
and they pick you up the handcuffs here 

1260
01:08:26,711 --> 01:08:27,544
and they put you in the side of the car.
The guide tells you this whole white 

1261
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:32,390
version of what happened.
The pursuit started on.

1262
01:08:32,391 --> 01:08:37,391
The vive wanted subject was moving and a
high rate of speed.

1263
01:08:39,111 --> 01:08:39,944
Fucking,
you know,

1264
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:43,280
if I just had to chase you for 20 miles,
I pitched them my you.

1265
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:44,643
It puts you in the fucking trunk.
They put you in the back seat in front 

1266
01:08:46,851 --> 01:08:49,820
of her.
The cameras take pictures and they put a

1267
01:08:49,821 --> 01:08:52,890
cot next to you on the drive there.
You got a couple back,

1268
01:08:52,891 --> 01:08:55,490
hands to your face.
You know what I'm saying?

1269
01:08:55,491 --> 01:08:58,910
That you hit the steering wheel or 
something a couple times.

1270
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:04,540
Then you go in there and you sit in a 
holding tank and then you fucking.

1271
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:10,880
If you're with one another person use 
you just shut your fucking mouth.

1272
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:14,060
You want to call your lawyer?
I call them lead.

1273
01:09:14,061 --> 01:09:14,894
They want to call your lawyer because 
you want one of the other guys to get a 

1274
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:21,360
lawyer.
So then like that you have to get a pub.

1275
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:24,560
It's conflict of interest.
So me,

1276
01:09:24,561 --> 01:09:25,394
you and Jamie got arrested right now I'm
going to shut my mouth and tell you I'm 

1277
01:09:29,321 --> 01:09:30,154
gonna.
Call my attorney later because I know 

1278
01:09:31,881 --> 01:09:34,040
for a fact Jamie's going to get a public
defender.

1279
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:38,450
So now I can't get a public defender 
because that's conflict of interest.

1280
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:41,600
So the state has to pay for a different 
attorney for me.

1281
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:43,813
Well a lot of people don't know that.
So you got arrested with two or three 

1282
01:09:47,331 --> 01:09:49,010
people.
You keep your mouth shut.

1283
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:50,360
Yeah.
Call my attorney later.

1284
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:51,570
You have an attorney?
Yeah.

1285
01:09:51,571 --> 01:09:52,404
I forget his name.

1286
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:54,203
Jamie cap.
But public defender now to public 

1287
01:09:57,411 --> 01:09:58,244
defenders can represent.
You got a better chance of getting a 

1288
01:10:01,731 --> 01:10:05,970
better attorney and the state pays for 
it.

1289
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:09,050
So next time you pay for your mortgage 
to go.

1290
01:10:09,051 --> 01:10:10,220
God Damn it.
This state,

1291
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:11,083
Texas.
That is because the jerk off like me 

1292
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:14,543
went.
We fucking johnny run battlebots and 

1293
01:10:16,521 --> 01:10:17,354
fucking he wants $800 an hour.
Even though the state will give him a 

1294
01:10:20,181 --> 01:10:22,850
$400 an hour,
it's like wholesale,

1295
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:23,713
you know what I'm saying?
But I at least I got a better type of 

1296
01:10:25,101 --> 01:10:26,600
attorney.
You game the system,

1297
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:27,523
you game the system.
It really is fucking crazy how I love 

1298
01:10:32,091 --> 01:10:32,924
figuring this shit out.
You will do your writing things down 

1299
01:10:35,391 --> 01:10:36,224
like you wouldn't even think.
And you just automatically started 

1300
01:10:37,371 --> 01:10:39,590
writing down numbers and percentages.
Shit.

1301
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,040
Oh yeah.
I know this shit.

1302
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:43,820
I grew up in this shit.
It is like a sport.

1303
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:48,080
So that's what he'll do hot.
And by the time we bring on a rape case,

1304
01:10:48,081 --> 01:10:53,060
you got to go up there and we lived the 
story and tell the dates and there was a

1305
01:10:53,061 --> 01:10:55,580
rape kit.
It's a very fucking tough.

1306
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:58,550
There's going to be very interesting 
pro.

1307
01:10:58,580 --> 01:10:59,413
What's going to happen.
The only thing is anything he cops to 

1308
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:05,240
come,
they gonna come back and I'm like oh Jay

1309
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:06,950
and try this.
Uhm,

1310
01:11:06,951 --> 01:11:11,810
so just live in Florida.
Make them fucking super eight films down

1311
01:11:11,811 --> 01:11:14,270
there in Miramar,
Florida.

1312
01:11:14,290 --> 01:11:15,123
Wherever the fuck he got it.
It's crazy when you see somebody get 

1313
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:22,140
sued because they work the system.
I'm not saying nothing bad yet.

1314
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:24,990
That's what your advisors and your 
people around you Italia.

1315
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:26,213
He uses hot water for the rest of his 
life because even if he gets that down 

1316
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:34,380
to like an assault charge and he has to 
serve eight months,

1317
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:36,300
12 months,
which is really eight.

1318
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,430
Once he gets out,
all the civil suits are going to come at

1319
01:11:41,431 --> 01:11:42,264
him.

1320
01:11:42,650 --> 01:11:43,483
Okay.

1321
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:44,543
And then he has to pull an old jim moved
to Florida where they can't touch you 

1322
01:11:47,101 --> 01:11:51,750
punch or some bullshit money at 
something like that.

1323
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:52,643
Wow.

1324
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:55,873
It's really crazy.
This is not unrelated to what we're 

1325
01:11:58,161 --> 01:12:01,100
talking about right now.
So this has happened I think since we've

1326
01:12:01,101 --> 01:12:01,934
been live.
I'm Kevin Spacey uploaded this video on 

1327
01:12:04,671 --> 01:12:05,504
his youtube channel where he's in 
character as Frank Underwood and since 

1328
01:12:08,901 --> 01:12:09,734
this has come out today,
he's now been indicted on rape charges 

1329
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:13,340
and Matt Massachusetts,
I believe.

1330
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:14,900
Whoa.
Felony rape charge.

1331
01:12:15,650 --> 01:12:16,483
So it's his plea to get his job back.
This might have come out without him 

1332
01:12:20,001 --> 01:12:21,410
knowing that was gonna happen.
I don't know.

1333
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:22,283
I was just.
See if you wanted to watch it and see 

1334
01:12:22,761 --> 01:12:25,340
what he's doing.
Should we watch it?

1335
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,730
If it watching,
we're going to kickstart tube.

1336
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:29,660
It's fair use.
Ish.

1337
01:12:29,810 --> 01:12:32,180
Ish.
I mean it should be definitely fair use.

1338
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:34,650
We can always watch it minute or 
something like that in a second seven.

1339
01:12:34,651 --> 01:12:37,970
See what he's doing.
He's washing his hands.

1340
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,580
I know what you want.
Oh sure.

1341
01:12:46,581 --> 01:12:49,700
They may have tried to separate us,
but what we have is too strong.

1342
01:12:49,701 --> 01:12:51,550
It's too powerful.
Mean.

1343
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,780
After all we shared everything.
You and I,

1344
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:55,303
I told you my deepest darkest secrets.
I showed you exactly what people are 

1345
01:12:59,871 --> 01:13:03,470
capable of.
I shocked you with my honesty,

1346
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:08,590
but mostly I challenged you and made you
think and you trusted me even though you

1347
01:13:10,971 --> 01:13:15,320
knew you shouldn't,
so we're not done.

1348
01:13:15,321 --> 01:13:20,321
No matter what anyone says and besides,
I know what you want.

1349
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:23,863
You want me back?
Of course she believed everything and 

1350
01:13:27,621 --> 01:13:29,680
I've just been waiting with bated breath
to him.

1351
01:13:29,681 --> 01:13:30,514
He confess at all.
They're just dying to have me declare 

1352
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:36,350
that everything said is true and that I 
got what I deserved.

1353
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:40,640
Wouldn't that be easy if it was all so 
simple?

1354
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:43,880
Only you and I both know it's never that
simple.

1355
01:13:43,881 --> 01:13:44,714
Not In politics and not in the live,
but you wouldn't believe the worst with 

1356
01:13:47,851 --> 01:13:48,160
it.

1357
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:52,550
We'll see Karen characters 100 percent 
supposed to be dead in the show.

1358
01:13:52,551 --> 01:13:53,384
Correct?

1359
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:57,760
Weird.
Is that strange to watch?

1360
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:02,560
It seems a little off his game,
right?

1361
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:04,260
I mean it metal.
Nothing.

1362
01:14:04,261 --> 01:14:07,510
When I was playing Frank Underwood,
he seems a little off like.

1363
01:14:07,511 --> 01:14:09,790
Okay,
we're a little tense on that one.

1364
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:10,713
Let's see.

1365
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:14,230
Let's get into this.
You're Frank Underwood.

1366
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:15,080
Come on,
man.

1367
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:15,840
Kevin,
Kevin,

1368
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,790
you frank it.
I'm Frank Underwood and then boom.

1369
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,890
Hit it a second time.
It's the second take.

1370
01:14:20,891 --> 01:14:22,930
Felt smoother.
Second take.

1371
01:14:22,931 --> 01:14:24,370
Felt smoother.
You know,

1372
01:14:24,371 --> 01:14:26,380
it seemed like acting.
It's weird.

1373
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:27,273
It's not like it's a great character and
that character is fucking great 

1374
01:14:30,461 --> 01:14:32,620
character.
I mean the Frank Underwood characters,

1375
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:37,280
like one of the all time TV characters,
but that's just weird.

1376
01:14:37,281 --> 01:14:38,320
He just brought them into real life.

1377
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:47,310
What happened on the way for Statutory 
Fox News according to Fox News,

1378
01:14:48,131 --> 01:14:48,964
but this is where everywhere else too.
He shared this video as he's announced 

1379
01:14:52,541 --> 01:14:57,310
that he's facing felony sexual assault 
charges for a salting,

1380
01:14:57,311 --> 01:15:01,480
a teenage son of a former news anchor 
and nantucket bar in 2016.

1381
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:04,933
He was going off on that powder,
who God knows the power they give you 

1382
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:15,710
what you buy in.
So just to make that tape just shows you

1383
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:16,850
how fucking creepy.

1384
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:17,773
Good.
I really think to be that good at 

1385
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:23,150
acting,
you gotta be out of your fucking mind.

1386
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:26,930
Kevin Spacey's bad mother Fucker when it
comes to acting,

1387
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:30,860
all the horrible things he's done aside.
There's a,

1388
01:15:30,861 --> 01:15:33,950
there's a quality about someone that,
that good,

1389
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:35,323
you know,
they're just got to like a certain 

1390
01:15:36,051 --> 01:15:40,430
amount of insanity to be apologizing for
his actions.

1391
01:15:40,431 --> 01:15:43,550
Everything he did is horrendous,
but it means to be surprised that you're

1392
01:15:43,551 --> 01:15:46,670
seeing him seem crazy there.
No,

1393
01:15:46,730 --> 01:15:48,350
that's not surprising.
He's too.

1394
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:49,393
He's too good to not be crazy.
Like I would assume that they're all 

1395
01:15:52,190 --> 01:15:53,120
one.
They're not crazy.

1396
01:15:53,121 --> 01:15:54,200
I'm shocked.
You know,

1397
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:55,330
when someone is,
uh,

1398
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,233
you know,
seems to like Daniel Day Lewis doesn't 

1399
01:15:58,401 --> 01:15:59,360
seem to be crazy,
right?

1400
01:15:59,361 --> 01:16:02,540
It just seems to be obsessed.
It seems to be obsessed with work.

1401
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:03,943
Maybe I'm wrong.
I think all of those brilliant 

1402
01:16:07,041 --> 01:16:11,100
motherfuckers are out of their mind.
Just his out of his mind as Germany.

1403
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:13,340
Horrible.
I did when I was a kid.

1404
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:14,600
My grandparents did.

1405
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:17,550
Shepherds are very smart,
intelligent dogs,

1406
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:22,600
but they all have a cork know I record,
you know,

1407
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:27,660
my mom wouldn't Luda hers.
She had a female bleed once a month,

1408
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:32,230
which made him even fucking crazier.
So when I was a kid,

1409
01:16:32,231 --> 01:16:35,130
my mom had one that you can go to next 
to a purse,

1410
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:39,030
but buddy stink.
He had one of my buddies thinking he had

1411
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,130
a German shepherd that was pure,
authentic.

1412
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:43,270
You could walk in the house.
I have a great time.

1413
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:48,900
I date and make a move for the door.
So he built all our friends in the ass.

1414
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,760
He didn't like when people laugh,
every one of them.

1415
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:56,620
So every one of us,
because of the extreme of what we do,

1416
01:16:56,621 --> 01:17:00,250
including yourself,
has to have some,

1417
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,133
you know,
something you will on the phone last 

1418
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:07,780
week speaking about Bill Burke,
he wanted the helicopter.

1419
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,160
He plays the drums.

1420
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:11,520
He's a comedian.
He's a dad,

1421
01:17:11,521 --> 01:17:14,180
he doesn't let a minute series,
you know,

1422
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:15,410
you know,
so hey,

1423
01:17:15,411 --> 01:17:18,410
you on a helicopter with bill birth wine
around the city,

1424
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:20,640
but two nights earlier,
he,

1425
01:17:20,641 --> 01:17:21,474
you laughing,
laugh at him onstage while he made fun 

1426
01:17:23,111 --> 01:17:26,780
of some fucking what I saw him last,
he was hysterical,

1427
01:17:26,781 --> 01:17:30,820
making fun of the Obama tour,
you know,

1428
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:36,080
so you're following me.
Those extremities is what makes you good

1429
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:39,980
at your main thing.
You know,

1430
01:17:39,981 --> 01:17:43,760
the fact that,
that fucking all those different things,

1431
01:17:43,761 --> 01:17:47,930
the fact that cowboy cerrone fights at 
the high level of competition,

1432
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:53,800
but then two weeks later he's high 
diving off a cliff or motorcycle racing.

1433
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:57,110
Not just that he does it while he's in 
training,

1434
01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:58,003
while he's in training.
That's what makes people who the fuck 

1435
01:18:01,131 --> 01:18:02,960
they are,
you know,

1436
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,560
uh,
when it comes to drugs,

1437
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:10,340
psychedelics or the hard shit,
you know,

1438
01:18:10,341 --> 01:18:11,174
you get these people that for years I 
heard rumors about certain actors that 

1439
01:18:14,901 --> 01:18:18,500
they show up on the set,
still coked up from the night before.

1440
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,590
But give them three cups of coffee,
give him breakfast,

1441
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:24,890
take a shower,
and then whoever they're supposed to be.

1442
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:30,440
So for that last eight hours,
they kept it together for the other 20.

1443
01:18:30,441 --> 01:18:34,610
They were a fucking mess.
Look at guys like Nick Nolte.

1444
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:37,520
Nick Nolte is one of the greats for 
sure.

1445
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:42,230
I mean unbelievable actor.
And he had some serious,

1446
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:46,510
serious substance abuse issues.
And it's past Jan.

1447
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:50,900
Michael vincent should have taken over 
hollywood watch some mechanic.

1448
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:52,420
You know,
we have.

1449
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:56,300
Listen bro.
The Me too.

1450
01:18:56,301 --> 01:18:59,630
Movement was a great movement.
it made people,

1451
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,233
you know,
whatever the words to let people know 

1452
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:08,390
what's going on.
But what happened to Marilyn Monroe,

1453
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:13,060
she was the first meet to victim.
Marilyn monroe was,

1454
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:16,760
if you look at it from an angle,
they passed around joe rogan,

1455
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:19,730
between the president nick,
connie,

1456
01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:23,990
the fucking mobster in chicago.
And who else passed around?

1457
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:27,080
She was married to mickey mantle.
She was married.

1458
01:19:27,081 --> 01:19:30,170
How many fucking times she was married 
to the playwright,

1459
01:19:30,450 --> 01:19:35,450
tormented that pole girl.
Then they found her dead or whateVer.

1460
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:36,080
No,
no,

1461
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:36,741
no.
To me,

1462
01:19:36,741 --> 01:19:39,300
Marilyn Monroe,
Marilyn Monroe.

1463
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:43,040
She's the first fucking original me to,
you know,

1464
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:43,660
uh,
that,

1465
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:48,660
that knocking down all of the gardener 
and schrader on sunset boulevard.

1466
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:52,250
But the last,
everything is closed,

1467
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:55,910
then nerd melt is closed.
Everything is closed on that block.

1468
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:59,270
You're hoping that's still open is that 
flower shop.

1469
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:02,900
They finally decided to close after a 
thousand years,

1470
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:04,213
but that was the flower shop where if 
you wanted to take them and rod and 

1471
01:20:07,790 --> 01:20:08,480
pressing,

1472
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:11,010
you got to order flowers from that 
flower shop.

1473
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:16,530
That was what it was famous for.
That dimaggio sinatra,

1474
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:20,190
everybody owned and flowers for Her,
for that shop.

1475
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:22,140
If you knew her,
they'd say,

1476
01:20:22,141 --> 01:20:22,974
what are you?
What is she like loud flowers from that 

1477
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:28,560
place on sunset.
But she was the original.

1478
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:32,730
Come on dog.
Think about how tragic her life was.

1479
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:38,240
And she was beautiful.
She was young and I had them all.

1480
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:43,610
But all of a sudden a slick young guy 
comes along with his voice and his tight

1481
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:45,713
shoes and he takes her away from me.
I'm a man that can not be familiar with 

1482
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:52,313
that dude tells waltz is nobody tells 
robert duvall when he comes over and 

1483
01:20:55,991 --> 01:20:56,824
thousands.
me once a natural in the movie and he 

1484
01:20:58,591 --> 01:20:59,880
goes,
there's a piece ass.

1485
01:20:59,890 --> 01:21:02,780
And I've had them all and she was the 
best piece app.

1486
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:05,730
But just to show You,
it's not about dollars and cents.

1487
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:10,970
I put singing lessons and dance lessons.
She was gotten to be a fucking star,

1488
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:14,610
but all of a sudden you're a boy comes 
along.

1489
01:21:14,611 --> 01:21:17,940
when is olive oil voice and his shiny 
shoes.

1490
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,400
And he makes sure he takes her away from
me.

1491
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:24,570
I'm not a man to be humiliated.
You know what that felt like?

1492
01:21:24,571 --> 01:21:26,460
And he goes off on him.
He throws his fucking.

1493
01:21:26,461 --> 01:21:30,150
What's his name out the next morning he 
wakes up in the dead horses.

1494
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:31,813
That's right.
That's the speech he gives that sinatra 

1495
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:37,200
fucking took his girl.
That's right.

1496
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:39,390
The horse in the bed scene was one 
theme.

1497
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,233
I was fucked up scenes ever in a movie.
Especially when you're 10 sell horses 

1498
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:45,680
head.
Oh they really?

1499
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:46,733
Oh yeah.
They killed a fucking horse for that 

1500
01:21:48,331 --> 01:21:49,980
scene.
A hundred percent.

1501
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:52,020
That ain't a fucking rubber horse.

1502
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,690
That's a real horse's head.
Do you ever watch it again?

1503
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:58,740
No,
I don't think I'm mistaken.

1504
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:01,840
I'm pretty sure I remember this.
I remember that it was.

1505
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:03,143
I might have a magnet,
I think that they might fucking throw 

1506
01:22:05,131 --> 01:22:08,520
you in jail today,
today.

1507
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:09,383
Even then in the seventies,
you can get away with it way bert rose 

1508
01:22:14,011 --> 01:22:19,011
made when he was throw the dog on the 
plane and inspect the showed up and they

1509
01:22:19,951 --> 01:22:23,160
kept saying,
oh shit,

1510
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,890
that's still moving leads to stump man 
and jam.

1511
01:22:25,891 --> 01:22:26,724
MichaeL vincent comes to take his job.
There's an old Burt reynolds movie 

1512
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:31,800
hopper,
hopper,

1513
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:35,700
hopper.
That's a movie about burt reynolds being

1514
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:39,330
the baddest man of all time,
but then jam.

1515
01:22:39,331 --> 01:22:42,780
Michael shows up and jam.
Mike was going to eat his lunch,

1516
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:47,370
but then burt reynolds puts jam like in 
this place and they make the jump in the

1517
01:22:47,371 --> 01:22:48,204
car together.
But the funny thing about that Movie is 

1518
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:51,563
that he has to jump out of a building 
and the guy that played the inspector 

1519
01:22:54,841 --> 01:22:57,620
was a wacky guy when he got here.
Jamie says,

1520
01:22:57,990 --> 01:22:59,130
snopes article.
It's true.

1521
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:01,573
Divorce.
The studio had encouraged francis ford 

1522
01:23:03,031 --> 01:23:05,040
coppola to use a fake horse head,
but he didn't.

1523
01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:06,150
He didn't like the

1524
01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:06,983
mockup.
His scouts founder horse ready for 

1525
01:23:08,981 --> 01:23:11,290
slaughter at a dog food plant in New 
Jersey.

1526
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:15,670
The art director pick one that looked 
like the horse in the film and said,

1527
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:17,980
when that one is slaughtered,
send us the head.

1528
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:23,800
He said one day a crate with dry eyes 
came with a horse's head in it.

1529
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:27,490
Fun.
Well,

1530
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:29,620
sounds like they're going to kill the 
horse anyway.

1531
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:31,990
That's probably better than not using 
it.

1532
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:34,490
Right,
but people have attached.

1533
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:39,310
We served horse rectum once on fear 
factor and horse people got real mad.

1534
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:41,620
They get very mad.
ThIs a scene.

1535
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:42,813
Here we go.
You imagine being this poor fuck and 

1536
01:23:48,231 --> 01:23:51,730
being entangled with the mom back then.
This is supposed to be filmed in what?

1537
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:52,573
Like the fifties as well.
It was supposed to take place in the 

1538
01:23:57,140 --> 01:24:00,090
fifties,
not showing it right.

1539
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:01,360
Other people at home,

1540
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:03,290
they can look okay.
It's a very famous.

1541
01:24:03,291 --> 01:24:04,124
What's really scary about this scene,
as they came into the house while you 

1542
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:08,334
were sleeping,
they wake you up and they put a horse's 

1543
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:14,310
head under your sheet message under the 
sheets.

1544
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:18,230
So lucky he realizes there's some blood.
Now he's looking around.

1545
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:20,090
He's like,
what the fuck?

1546
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:23,390
What the fuck is this?
How good is this actor?

1547
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:24,650
Who's his doctor?
What's his name?

1548
01:24:24,651 --> 01:24:25,484
He's been in everything.

1549
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:31,840
Oh fuck.
Yeah.

1550
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:35,330
He's looking at the blood.
It's all over his fucking sheets.

1551
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:39,100
I mean,
it's fucking crate and that's real blood

1552
01:24:39,101 --> 01:24:42,370
too,
and there's a horse's head and he starts

1553
01:24:42,371 --> 01:24:43,204
screaming.

1554
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:50,600
They chopped his fucking stuff and embed
with them.

1555
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:52,370
That was like a prized stallion that he 
had.

1556
01:24:52,371 --> 01:24:56,720
right.
He fucking took him that he assaulted.

1557
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:59,610
He insulted.
He goes,

1558
01:24:59,611 --> 01:25:02,540
see you get on and I ain't no band 
leader.

1559
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:03,951
And he goes,
yeah,

1560
01:25:03,951 --> 01:25:04,784
I heard about that story because that 
was the story michael tells to check 

1561
01:25:08,471 --> 01:25:10,970
that that day.
How do you know sinatra?

1562
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:11,930
She goes,
well,

1563
01:25:12,430 --> 01:25:15,240
my father's gun,
he's god godfather.

1564
01:25:15,870 --> 01:25:17,150
But he goes,
what does that mean?

1565
01:25:17,151 --> 01:25:17,984
And he goes,
he sang with the tommy dorsey band and 

1566
01:25:20,660 --> 01:25:22,310
tommy said,
I'm not releasing them.

1567
01:25:22,311 --> 01:25:25,790
And they put a gun to his head.
Luca brasi pulled a gun.

1568
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,720
He said,
you're either going to sign it or you,

1569
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:32,100
your brain's going to be across it.
Which one?

1570
01:25:32,101 --> 01:25:34,130
That they paid a dollar for sinatra.

1571
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:41,420
So that's why when this guy shows up and
he goes,

1572
01:25:41,421 --> 01:25:46,421
I ain't no fucking band leader.
And that was the last time he tells some

1573
01:25:46,761 --> 01:25:48,900
guy like robert duvall,
robert duvall says,

1574
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:52,000
if you mind,
I have a plane,

1575
01:25:52,430 --> 01:25:57,430
are you driver said to get me to the 
playing [inaudible] vito corleone,

1576
01:25:57,601 --> 01:26:02,570
he's a man of assisting bad news right 
away and hearing bad news right away.

1577
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,460
And he goes,
you go tell them.

1578
01:26:04,770 --> 01:26:07,880
And the next morning to fucking dead 
horse,

1579
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:10,333
jesus christ.
What a way to send somebody a message 

1580
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:14,930
though.
That was a good fucking movie.

1581
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:16,333
All those movies were great.
I got the problem is that got italians 

1582
01:26:19,131 --> 01:26:20,450
way to,
into being an italian.

1583
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:21,753
They started over the crazy.
I will tell you this joe rogan and I 

1584
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:29,610
told you this a couple of weeks ago and 
I know it's tough for you.

1585
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:31,910
it's tough for me,
uh,

1586
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:32,870
subtitles.

1587
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:37,870
But this episode of narcos is really 
been doing it all in subtitles.

1588
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:39,223
No,
they got a lot of language but it's 

1589
01:26:41,301 --> 01:26:45,440
tough for people to watch.
But like I told the guy who played pablo

1590
01:26:45,441 --> 01:26:47,840
was a bad.
Like I was saying the other day,

1591
01:26:47,841 --> 01:26:49,520
I was talking to somebody you don't want
man.

1592
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:53,300
I grew up watching american movies and I
loved him,

1593
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:58,900
but my undercurrent was watching spanish
television at night from the age of five

1594
01:27:01,070 --> 01:27:01,903
to eight and nine.
there was a couple novella is that I 

1595
01:27:04,461 --> 01:27:07,440
really appreciate it and I kinda liked 
the acting.

1596
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:09,200
I was like,
these guys could fucking act,

1597
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:10,423
but I forgot all about it.
And then I watched Man on fire and 

1598
01:27:13,221 --> 01:27:16,490
managed fire.
Had some phenomenal spanish acting.

1599
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:19,910
Plus they had the italian guy giancarlo 
giannini.

1600
01:27:19,911 --> 01:27:20,744
How bad of a fucking.
How bad of a Motherfucking itali you 

1601
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:25,700
will get.

1602
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:30,700
Name is gian carlo g and nini.
He's the one that was in a hannibal.

1603
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:36,230
Hannibal stabs him and then fucking 
closes his guts out in the fucking.

1604
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:38,140
I don't know if you've ever watched 
hannibal.

1605
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:42,320
No one shows up and that's a wow.
He kills his stomach,

1606
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:47,810
but he is the kopan man on fire.
The one who brings jesus to girl's ass.

1607
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:51,390
Man on fire.
I had a lot of good like side actors,

1608
01:27:51,690 --> 01:27:55,030
but a lot of great spanish acme 
services,

1609
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:58,640
norcos and all to hold and all these 
shows to come on back.

1610
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:01,280
I'm watching these dudes and I'm like,
bro,

1611
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:04,820
he's tied these guys from old soap 
opera,

1612
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:07,490
spanish soap operas,
which is tough.

1613
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:08,383
If you ever did a soap opera,
it's a general hospital and let me tell 

1614
01:28:12,381 --> 01:28:13,214
you something.
If I would have gotten off a plane and 

1615
01:28:15,531 --> 01:28:17,490
on general hospital,
I would have gotten fired.

1616
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,113
Thank god I was p at 12 and 13 years and
I knew my way around the set it and you 

1617
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:28,440
book or so bob,
nobody talks to you.

1618
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:29,813
You know,
like you walk into abc over there and 

1619
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:36,350
got street,
you walk in,

1620
01:28:36,890 --> 01:28:39,500
they'll your id and they'd go,
go to room 27.

1621
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:42,770
You go to your office,
you fucking your suits.

1622
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:45,830
The lady coMes in and she goes,
how you doing?

1623
01:28:45,831 --> 01:28:46,664
My name is mildred.
Watch the tv and look for your numbers 

1624
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:53,600
to come up.
You sit down,

1625
01:28:53,601 --> 01:28:54,590
you're right.
Your numbers.

1626
01:28:54,591 --> 01:28:55,424
I'm in scene 27,
chapter eight and you sit there with 

1627
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:02,000
wardrobe on for

1628
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,660
you.
I wouldn't go there at 8:00.

1629
01:29:03,690 --> 01:29:06,420
I'd be in my car and quarter at a tiMe.
Really?

1630
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:09,750
How many soap operas?
General hospital.

1631
01:29:09,751 --> 01:29:10,584
Three episodes.
I find that three episodes in general 

1632
01:29:15,901 --> 01:29:16,734
hospital was amazing.
I played a recovering fucking preacher 

1633
01:29:19,491 --> 01:29:23,910
who had been in prison and I came out 
and now I was a fucking marriage thing,

1634
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:25,560
bro.
When they called me,

1635
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:26,760
they called me.
They're like,

1636
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:29,970
we're interested in you sending a real.
And I'm like,

1637
01:29:29,971 --> 01:29:30,330
wait,
whoa,

1638
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:30,781
whoa,

1639
01:29:30,781 --> 01:29:31,111

1640
01:29:31,111 --> 01:29:31,944
whoa,

1641
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:34,710
So benjamin bratt.
Those good looking dudes.

1642
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,200
They started on general hospital as you 
want me.

1643
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:40,800
Are you fucking crazy?
I sent them a real.

1644
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:42,420
I swear to god,
man.

1645
01:29:42,421 --> 01:29:44,380
He just like,
they really want your real job.

1646
01:29:44,430 --> 01:29:46,110
What do you want me to do?
I go send it to him.

1647
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:48,270
What do you want me to deliver?
Going to hire me,

1648
01:29:48,271 --> 01:29:48,600
bro.

1649
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:52,410
They called right back.
Come on down for three days.

1650
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,590
Wow.
You walk in there,

1651
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,280
joe rogan.
You give them your id.

1652
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:58,710
It's that fast.
You go to your room,

1653
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:03,000
they'll say 28.
Prepare wardrobe.

1654
01:30:03,001 --> 01:30:03,834
You're 10 minutes away.
You put whatever wardrobe they give you 

1655
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:09,030
one.
They have cue cards for you.

1656
01:30:09,330 --> 01:30:12,290
Uh,
they have a year under a fucking another

1657
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,250
cameras.
It's a three camera shoot.

1658
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:16,800
You go out that says,
okay,

1659
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:18,390
activism at 28,
come out.

1660
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:20,850
You come out.
I ain't doing joe rogan.

1661
01:30:20,851 --> 01:30:22,200
Very nice to meet you.
Okay,

1662
01:30:22,710 --> 01:30:24,030
let's do this.
Action.

1663
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:25,321
Boom,
boom,

1664
01:30:25,321 --> 01:30:25,861
boom,
boom.

1665
01:30:25,861 --> 01:30:28,890
Let's say you fuck up your line.
They don't give a fuck.

1666
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:33,060
Like if you start from all whole now 
we'll start from that line.

1667
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:33,991
Bop,
bop,

1668
01:30:33,991 --> 01:30:34,321
bop,
bop,

1669
01:30:34,321 --> 01:30:34,680
bop,
bop,

1670
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:35,310
bop.
Cut.

1671
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:36,143
Moving ahead.
While all of a sudden they switch you 

1672
01:30:38,131 --> 01:30:38,601
out,
blah,

1673
01:30:38,601 --> 01:30:39,120
blah,
blah.

1674
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:42,500
They put makeup on you and they're like,
you're not in the scene.

1675
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:44,210
Just sit over here for five minutes,
bro.

1676
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:46,330
Five minutes.
They come right back to you.

1677
01:30:46,390 --> 01:30:47,223
All right,
you're ready.

1678
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:48,810
You're going to scene three and you're 
like,

1679
01:30:48,811 --> 01:30:50,790
what the fuck happened?
Bop,

1680
01:30:50,791 --> 01:30:51,211
bop,
bop,

1681
01:30:51,211 --> 01:30:51,631
bop,
bop,

1682
01:30:51,631 --> 01:30:52,464
bop,
bop,

1683
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:54,540
bop your wrap.
Thank you for coming down.

1684
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:57,360
Nobody talks to you.
Nobody does nothing.

1685
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:00,550
Huh?
So it's not a.

1686
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:03,680
They're Just trying to get it out quick.
They don't hold youR hand.

1687
01:31:03,681 --> 01:31:05,670
It's eight to five.
Wow.

1688
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:09,180
Being on a soap opera is probably the 
easiest way.

1689
01:31:09,181 --> 01:31:10,014
Like if you landed on general hospital,
used to be in a general husband for 30 

1690
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:15,120
years,
that dude's been on there for 30 years,

1691
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:17,860
you know,
you could be on there.

1692
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:18,733
People been on it for a long time.
So it's eight to five hospitals that 

1693
01:31:22,201 --> 01:31:24,390
luke and laura.
I was

1694
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:25,940
luke and laura.
Right.

1695
01:31:26,350 --> 01:31:30,200
Remember luke and laura know what 
happened.

1696
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:31,113
There was a thing that happened in soap 
operas and it happened while I was a 

1697
01:31:33,341 --> 01:31:34,174
kid.
Luke and laura transcended general 

1698
01:31:37,271 --> 01:31:41,200
hospital and became a thing all 
throughout the world.

1699
01:31:41,230 --> 01:31:41,941
There's people.
Well,

1700
01:31:41,941 --> 01:31:42,774
yeah,
these people didn't make sense because 

1701
01:31:44,741 --> 01:31:47,850
the dude's hair was weird and strange 
couple.

1702
01:31:47,851 --> 01:31:49,840
I did the scene with a dog.
They were weird.

1703
01:31:50,230 --> 01:31:51,310
Yeah,
I did the sCene with him.

1704
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:54,280
She was a little too hot for him.
It didn't make a whole lot of sense,

1705
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:55,353
but it worked for whatever reason,
it caught fire culturally and became a 

1706
01:31:58,781 --> 01:31:59,980
big.
And I

1707
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:02,200
think I was in high school at the time.
There were,

1708
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:03,310
there were.
There was a 19,

1709
01:32:03,311 --> 01:32:04,270
83.
Okay.

1710
01:32:04,271 --> 01:32:05,104
Yeah.
So I was in high school while I was in 

1711
01:32:06,401 --> 01:32:07,234
high school.
This was all going down and everybody 

1712
01:32:09,101 --> 01:32:09,934
paid attention to luke and laura was 
like the general hospital thing took 

1713
01:32:13,151 --> 01:32:13,984
over the country.
It was like on the cover of people 

1714
01:32:15,581 --> 01:32:17,350
magazine and shit.
It was everywhere.

1715
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:21,670
It was this one weird relationship on a 
soap opera for some reason.

1716
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:25,060
Just became this gigantic phenomenon 
that everybody was watching.

1717
01:32:25,330 --> 01:32:26,230
I mean,
I was watching it.

1718
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:27,191
I was like,
I said,

1719
01:32:27,191 --> 01:32:30,050
30 million viewers.
Fucking crazy.

1720
01:32:30,051 --> 01:32:30,884
That is what was,
what was the show with the good luck of 

1721
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:33,680
sangha,
uh,

1722
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:35,950
wishes.
She was jessie's girl.

1723
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:36,791
Oh,
rick springfield,

1724
01:32:36,791 --> 01:32:38,410
general hospital.
St joe and I watched.

1725
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:41,380
That wasn't even him.
See if him,

1726
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:42,920
if he was with laura,
I watched.

1727
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:46,450
He's a handsome son of a bitch that rick
springfield,

1728
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:48,760
you know,
and he was a double threat.

1729
01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:52,210
He was on general hospital and he was a 
bad ass singer.

1730
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:53,890
That jessie's girl,
that song,

1731
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:57,800
if you're at fuCking like wild wings and
jessie's girl comes onto you and excited

1732
01:32:57,801 --> 01:33:02,801
at the beginning of it that jesse's.
He's still out there hitting it.

1733
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:06,390
Still touring,
touring.

1734
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:08,530
I think he was at the canyon club and a 
gora.

1735
01:33:10,550 --> 01:33:14,170
He's out there.
ThAt dude was when I was in high school,

1736
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,033
that dude was on top of the food chain.
every girl had a poster hill on the 

1737
01:33:18,581 --> 01:33:21,720
wall.
Lake town next month.

1738
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:22,863
Good for him.
It's crazy that whatever soap opera was 

1739
01:33:25,511 --> 01:33:26,344
on from 12 to one was a big time soap 
opera and there was a bar in New York 

1740
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:33,970
and there was a bar in New Jersey and my
neighborhood,

1741
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:38,890
if you walked in there from 12 to one 
and you said a word,

1742
01:33:39,370 --> 01:33:40,203
somebody would tell you to shut the fuck
up and it was 98 percent men and they 

1743
01:33:44,651 --> 01:33:48,910
would serve lunch and it was when I 
would go to was the midtown lounge,

1744
01:33:48,911 --> 01:33:52,870
but there was another one.
So there was a lunchtime soap opera that

1745
01:33:52,871 --> 01:33:53,704
men left ed jobs for construction guys 
and they would sit there and watch this 

1746
01:33:58,421 --> 01:34:01,480
soap opera to tv's like it was a yankee 
game.

1747
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:04,660
What the fuck?
And then they will go back to work.

1748
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:08,320
I have to get thiS train.
Is that.

1749
01:34:08,370 --> 01:34:09,880
How strange is that?
That was a thing.

1750
01:34:09,881 --> 01:34:12,800
It was a big thing at one point and I 
still remember,

1751
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:15,310
you know,
if you dated a girl and she stayed in on

1752
01:34:15,311 --> 01:34:16,144
wednesdays to watch dynasty bitch,
you stated on dynasty night if that 

1753
01:34:21,110 --> 01:34:21,943
lookie cookie,
that makes sense for like today it's 

1754
01:34:23,951 --> 01:34:25,060
translatable.
You know,

1755
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,730
sunday night gaMe of thrones is on or 
whenever night it's on.

1756
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:31,000
It's like people do get together and 
they watch it live as it goes on.

1757
01:34:31,030 --> 01:34:31,863
That makes sense.
What doesn't make sense is that the 

1758
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,540
market for those kind of soap operas 
was.

1759
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:40,270
It was appealing to men and high school 
kids.

1760
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:44,650
Like we're all watching it.
Who shot jr bro.

1761
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:45,920
That's dallas.
But that's.

1762
01:34:46,070 --> 01:34:47,020
No,
no,

1763
01:34:47,790 --> 01:34:50,580
not now we're talking then.
yeah.

1764
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:53,630
Not only were they sucking you in the 
daytiMe in those days,

1765
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:56,840
this was all the eighties were talking 
about the eighties.

1766
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:58,070
Okay.

1767
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:59,960
What the fuck was going on at night?
Both.

1768
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:05,160
You had dallas and you had,
what was the one on abc with alexis.

1769
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:11,700
Can I ring the dynaSty and the guy that 
was bad as a bad ass girl right now.

1770
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:13,993
The checkup played the princess on that.
That was supposed to be alexis's 

1771
01:35:18,261 --> 01:35:21,990
daughter and she was having an affair 
with dexter dexter.

1772
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:23,433
She's the one right now that's going 
through that thing with a daughter in 

1773
01:35:25,731 --> 01:35:26,564
the sex ring up in Connecticut.
There was like a sex ring novo or 

1774
01:35:30,591 --> 01:35:34,710
whatever.
Like she's a princess life watches?

1775
01:35:34,830 --> 01:35:35,663
Yes.
She's the one that's going through all 

1776
01:35:37,761 --> 01:35:42,761
that with the daughter.
I remember her being on dynasty as a hot

1777
01:35:43,790 --> 01:35:44,623
hot and she was alexis's daughter,
but dexter dexter was alexis's husband 

1778
01:35:50,451 --> 01:35:51,284
and she had some.

1779
01:35:53,090 --> 01:35:55,770
Dexter dexter I'm going to rename is 
tHat.

1780
01:35:56,100 --> 01:36:00,380
Look at that cast.
Joan collins.

1781
01:36:00,650 --> 01:36:02,810
She's still hot back then.
She's the original milf,

1782
01:36:02,930 --> 01:36:03,770
right?
Yeah,

1783
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:05,740
for sure,
because she was super hot.

1784
01:36:06,590 --> 01:36:08,450
How old do you think she was back then?
50.

1785
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:10,800
Yeah.
She was 51 and she was rushing that.

1786
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:13,660
She was hot as fuck and look at ricardo 
month and bomb.

1787
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:14,593
How much he.
That dude got paid on that fucking 

1788
01:36:16,461 --> 01:36:17,840
island.
How they.

1789
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:21,930
How they haven't done a remake of 
fantasy.

1790
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:23,593
They did a comic book.
A couple comics went out there and did 

1791
01:36:29,211 --> 01:36:31,560
it.
Yeah,

1792
01:36:31,561 --> 01:36:32,394
they had.
They had.

1793
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:34,200
It was on tv for a little bit.
No,

1794
01:36:34,201 --> 01:36:37,650
they fuck wasn't the love boat was the 
boat.

1795
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:41,880
Am I confusing it mom before fucking.
No,

1796
01:36:41,881 --> 01:36:42,714
but I mean the new version of it was,
there was either a new version of the 

1797
01:36:44,821 --> 01:36:46,470
love boat or new version of fantasy 
island.

1798
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:47,423
So one of the two.
Neither of them are showing up near 

1799
01:36:50,131 --> 01:36:51,450
there.
One dynasty actually was,

1800
01:36:51,530 --> 01:36:53,910
but it was in the nineties.
It was,

1801
01:36:53,911 --> 01:36:58,911
um,
it was in the nineties because,

1802
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:03,750
um,
do you remember cherry red wilson?

1803
01:37:03,810 --> 01:37:06,750
the next show?
Jerry redd.

1804
01:37:06,751 --> 01:37:09,450
Wilson was supposed to be filming that.
What was it?

1805
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:10,313
Which one was about the love boat?
Cherry red wilson was supposed to be 

1806
01:37:12,601 --> 01:37:14,890
filming that show and he,
uh,

1807
01:37:15,090 --> 01:37:15,923
went to a doctor and turned down he had 
meningitis and I guess apparently he 

1808
01:37:20,761 --> 01:37:25,761
left the doctor's office because he was 
waiting and he,

1809
01:37:26,341 --> 01:37:28,320
uh,
by the time he got there,

1810
01:37:28,321 --> 01:37:30,570
I guess flying when you have that really
bad,

1811
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:32,580
by the time he got there,
he died.

1812
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:35,200
Wait.
Died shortly after.

1813
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:37,390
It's horrible.
Horrible to hear.

1814
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:40,240
Who's a good guy?
Good guy.

1815
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:41,133
Funny.
Funny.

1816
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:46,430
So you had a lot of fucking character.
I worked at that kid a lot in New York.

1817
01:37:46,910 --> 01:37:48,980
We did gigs together on the road 
together a little bit too.

1818
01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:52,170
That was a good little click.
I remember bleeding in seattle.

1819
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:54,250
He came up,
louis c k came up.

1820
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:57,480
All those guys were all coming up 
together at that time in New York,

1821
01:37:58,290 --> 01:38:00,150
so it was a good bunch of guys,
you know?

1822
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:03,293
Yeah man,
they do remake a lot of fucking 

1823
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:10,760
television shows.
I mean it is fucking ridiculous thing.

1824
01:38:11,050 --> 01:38:12,800
They make so many shows.
It makes it like.

1825
01:38:13,190 --> 01:38:17,010
Is it that hard to come up with a new 
line of thought?

1826
01:38:17,011 --> 01:38:17,844
like how many more va zombie shows 
they're gonna have to have a new zombie 

1827
01:38:20,641 --> 01:38:21,474
show.
right?

1828
01:38:22,130 --> 01:38:24,690
I think they're making world war z as a 
team in China,

1829
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:28,230
but there's a new,
a walking dead in China now.

1830
01:38:28,231 --> 01:38:29,940
I Think like,
okay,

1831
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:33,720
that I think I know what's going to 
happen.

1832
01:38:33,721 --> 01:38:35,130
Bad things,
you know,

1833
01:38:35,131 --> 01:38:37,560
like you have a.
When you were growing up.

1834
01:38:37,561 --> 01:38:38,790
I don't know where the fuck you grew up.

1835
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:40,193
Let's just say boston for awhile.
That was one fucking sandwich shop and 

1836
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:44,383
he wanted to and guide because he made 
you legit sandwich and all of a sudden 

1837
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:52,230
another guy opened up,
but that was cool,

1838
01:38:52,231 --> 01:38:56,400
but now subway came and now the safeway 
started making sandwiches,

1839
01:38:56,401 --> 01:39:01,020
so now nobody's making money.
It's the same thing with movies and tv.

1840
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:05,430
It's like there's so much content we 
can't keep up with.

1841
01:39:05,431 --> 01:39:06,264
It caN't keep up.
You can't keep up with the amount of 

1842
01:39:07,741 --> 01:39:11,940
content that's out there,
so when you try to remake a show,

1843
01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:16,230
I want it to be.
They really make a ton of shit,

1844
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:20,250
but they forget the main element of 
which is the heart aspect of it.

1845
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:21,720
Let me tell you something you got to 
say.

1846
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:24,480
That's good.
That's out right now on amazon prime.

1847
01:39:24,780 --> 01:39:27,060
Marvelous.
Mrs maizel tremendous.

1848
01:39:27,930 --> 01:39:28,890
He watched it.
Yeah.

1849
01:39:28,891 --> 01:39:30,050
Yeah.
The two episodes.

1850
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:30,560
Mountain.
Yeah.

1851
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:34,350
She's.
She's a stand up comic and she's hanging

1852
01:39:34,351 --> 01:39:36,820
out with lenny bruce.
It's fucking amazing.

1853
01:39:36,830 --> 01:39:40,440
It's a good show.
It's a real good show.

1854
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:42,780
This is the first show I've ever watched
on amazon prime.

1855
01:39:42,781 --> 01:39:43,614
It's very easy to do.
You just set it up through the apple tv 

1856
01:39:45,770 --> 01:39:47,940
with log in,
baM fucking thing.

1857
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:49,073
Fuck off.
It's like the thing about like things 

1858
01:39:51,661 --> 01:39:55,050
like apple tv or netflix that are so 
good is once you're logged in,

1859
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:56,510
it's right there.
Right?

1860
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:57,630
you go to it.
It's easy.

1861
01:39:57,810 --> 01:40:02,810
We're so lazy now that the extra step to
log in to another service,

1862
01:40:03,451 --> 01:40:05,430
whether it's whatever it is,
you know,

1863
01:40:06,030 --> 01:40:09,020
another thing on top of the getting onto
itunes.

1864
01:40:09,021 --> 01:40:10,440
So I got even one More thing.
Oh,

1865
01:40:10,441 --> 01:40:14,880
I gotta I gotta use my password.
They're like that little extra step.

1866
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:17,820
Even just setting it up.
once you get it set up,

1867
01:40:17,821 --> 01:40:20,040
you could just go to it,
but before you do that,

1868
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:23,610
that extra step bothers the shit out of 
people for whatever reason.

1869
01:40:25,030 --> 01:40:29,170
Ease teas.
I go,

1870
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:34,460
I just had My wife program for me.
Have to go to the plan.

1871
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:36,593
I put it in airplane mode,
I hit the wifi thing and next thing you 

1872
01:40:40,351 --> 01:40:42,600
know i'M watching fucking tv.
I get it.

1873
01:40:43,210 --> 01:40:45,690
I try to keep it like I'm wearing right 
now.

1874
01:40:45,691 --> 01:40:46,524
I'm on the second time of watching 
narcos in Mexico because I liked the 

1875
01:40:50,071 --> 01:40:52,710
acting so much that the guy,
diego luna,

1876
01:40:53,230 --> 01:40:58,230
joe rogan ain't no joke.
That dude waS in dubai mba and it's such

1877
01:40:59,471 --> 01:41:02,110
a difference.
He's such a bad ass motherfucker.

1878
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:03,783
I don't want to spoil it for you,
but fuck you if you haven't watched it 

1879
01:41:06,101 --> 01:41:06,934
by an I.
You slipping and watched the first two 

1880
01:41:08,981 --> 01:41:13,410
seasons.
Do you watch the pablo seasons?

1881
01:41:14,350 --> 01:41:15,730
Which were.
He was very good.

1882
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,830
He was a very good act.
I enjoyed them.

1883
01:41:18,190 --> 01:41:21,640
Then the third season with the cali 
cartel and that was,

1884
01:41:21,641 --> 01:41:22,474
okay,
this mexican woman just sit alone on 

1885
01:41:24,681 --> 01:41:24,850
this.

1886
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:28,360
We're fully based from when you watch 
this shit explains a lot.

1887
01:41:28,361 --> 01:41:30,290
Why felipe?
Based away from the payers.

1888
01:41:30,940 --> 01:41:33,200
I tell you what,
if I could move to solo,

1889
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:35,350
I would.
I belong down there.

1890
01:41:36,210 --> 01:41:39,600
it's just a city full of fucking fucking
crazy shit.

1891
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:43,690
Just crazy.
And they figured out how to grow weed in

1892
01:41:43,691 --> 01:41:47,050
the desert and they were making 
$30,000,000

1893
01:41:47,051 --> 01:41:50,590
a week,
a bunch of crazed fucking indians,

1894
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:51,563
but we never found out how much.
What percentage of marijuana that we 

1895
01:41:54,311 --> 01:41:55,144
used to have is you're right,
but it's also really hard to test back 

1896
01:41:57,461 --> 01:42:02,461
then and they weren't testing back 
testing and strongest weed.

1897
01:42:02,710 --> 01:42:04,840
I was smoking back then was chocolate 
pie.

1898
01:42:04,841 --> 01:42:08,410
With that,
we've made me go fucking crazy.

1899
01:42:08,590 --> 01:42:09,423
Someone had explained to me the 
difference between strains that were 

1900
01:42:12,731 --> 01:42:17,000
raised in Afghanistan and strains that 
came from other places.

1901
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:19,810
Like right now,
dean or friends from the store.

1902
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:22,960
He got a seat from afghany wheat from 
the old days.

1903
01:42:22,990 --> 01:42:25,180
Shit.
So he denies that.

1904
01:42:25,181 --> 01:42:26,014
I guess the word they use is not the 
word and he keeps trying to get that 

1905
01:42:29,621 --> 01:42:31,390
seat,
but I still remember smoke.

1906
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:35,440
Any weed you will go for,
you were going for a ride,

1907
01:42:35,470 --> 01:42:36,303
but you're.
Your tolerance is so high now and the 

1908
01:42:38,801 --> 01:42:40,990
weed,
you're smoking his weapon grade.

1909
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:42,490
I mean you're.
You are.

1910
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:44,620
You are smoking some of the most insane 
wheat.

1911
01:42:44,621 --> 01:42:47,200
I ended up.
Wait a vape pen the other day.

1912
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:49,450
A simple little vape pen.
I took one hit.

1913
01:42:49,451 --> 01:42:54,451
I was a blitzer rated right now.
Damn strongly are now.

1914
01:42:54,630 --> 01:42:57,010
You've got to be really careful now.
I was cocky.

1915
01:42:57,011 --> 01:42:59,860
I was treating it like the old ones,
especially those disposable ones.

1916
01:42:59,861 --> 01:43:01,810
You can take three,
four heads before even feel it.

1917
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:02,853
One hit of biliterate it,
but especially since I stopped with the 

1918
01:43:06,101 --> 01:43:06,934
edibles.

1919
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:09,230
That changed the game.
Yeah.

1920
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:11,350
Yeah.
Double drop.

1921
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:14,200
Changed the game of you are 100 percent 
off the edibles.

1922
01:43:14,330 --> 01:43:15,660
Hundred percent.
I god,

1923
01:43:16,450 --> 01:43:21,450
our buddy george has thousand milligram,
had a booth and they gave me two bags.

1924
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:25,210
I think like tonight.
Oh,

1925
01:43:25,390 --> 01:43:27,760
I'll take a bite out of the other book 
because it's christmas,

1926
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:31,000
but I had to cut it out because it was 
just killing me.

1927
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:34,210
It was,
was taken away from my other high.

1928
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:35,433
I enjoyed taking it.
So over pipe in the morning gets me 

1929
01:43:38,081 --> 01:43:39,760
going,
gets me listening to music.

1930
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:41,860
I'm writing a little bit.
I'm loose.

1931
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:46,030
I love being loose with title nine at 
two isn't me.

1932
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:50,500
I enjoy that shit.
I can't go on the road.

1933
01:43:50,530 --> 01:43:51,470
I don't bring pipe

1934
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:53,780
so I got to bring the.
Sent me.

1935
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:57,350
If I got to come down off the 11th floor
and walk two blocks,

1936
01:43:57,351 --> 01:43:59,000
I got to smoke the whole fuck of the 
drawing,

1937
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:01,280
so I got to go back to my room and pass 
out.

1938
01:44:01,910 --> 01:44:04,760
Like that's how strong the witness I 
could just kills me.

1939
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:07,460
Especially now that I'm not eating them 
anymore,

1940
01:44:08,270 --> 01:44:10,010
just kills me.
Mama finds me.

1941
01:44:10,770 --> 01:44:11,603
I go back to the room.
I watched three episodes or somebody I 

1942
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:18,960
think about this.
Scientists making wheat now.

1943
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:22,670
I mean they've gotten.
They got real botanists involved.

1944
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:25,520
There's money in it now.
Now that it's opening up in Canada,

1945
01:44:25,521 --> 01:44:29,630
it's going to be really weird because in
Canada they're making it legal,

1946
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:31,010
right?
It's legal now,

1947
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:32,053
so I'm.
I'm pretty sure rj reynolds is that who 

1948
01:44:34,131 --> 01:44:34,964
it was.
It was just dumped a shit ton of money 

1949
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:37,213
and to some marijuana production in 
Canada that's going to file suit in the 

1950
01:44:40,461 --> 01:44:41,180
United States.

1951
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:42,013
It's.
There's too much money involved in it 

1952
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:46,220
and it's going to be good for everybody.
It's going to Be good for capitalism.

1953
01:44:46,221 --> 01:44:47,054
It's going to be good for people getting
marijuana as long as regular people 

1954
01:44:50,331 --> 01:44:51,164
could sell marijuana to let fucking rj 
reynolds as long as they don't put some 

1955
01:44:55,491 --> 01:44:56,720
restrictions like they were trying to 
put.

1956
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:57,873
Was it you?
Jamie told me about what they were 

1957
01:44:58,551 --> 01:44:59,384
trying to do in Ohio where they were 
trying to make it set up where you 

1958
01:45:01,791 --> 01:45:03,650
could,
you could grow weed,

1959
01:45:03,651 --> 01:45:06,950
but only a couple companies could grow 
it so that we would be legal,

1960
01:45:06,951 --> 01:45:08,660
but only a couple of companies would 
monopolize.

1961
01:45:09,230 --> 01:45:10,730
And then everybody was like,
fuck this.

1962
01:45:11,110 --> 01:45:13,760
I ended up passing it.
I believe that's terrible.

1963
01:45:14,180 --> 01:45:16,790
It's sad that,
that mean that's such a corruption.

1964
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:17,960
That's like saying,
okay,

1965
01:45:17,961 --> 01:45:18,794
you can have tomatoes,
but we're the only ones who grow these 

1966
01:45:21,530 --> 01:45:22,100
tomatoes.

1967
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:23,930
Like why?
It's a tomato.

1968
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:24,913
That's a law against nature.
So you're saying that nature can't take 

1969
01:45:27,051 --> 01:45:27,884
place.
I can't put a seed in the ground and 

1970
01:45:28,581 --> 01:45:30,950
grow my own shit.
Get the fuck out of here.

1971
01:45:30,951 --> 01:45:32,180
Is it legal?
It's illegal.

1972
01:45:32,210 --> 01:45:33,740
Okay.
How's it different than corn?

1973
01:45:34,130 --> 01:45:35,360
How's it different than a fucking,
uh,

1974
01:45:35,380 --> 01:45:37,420
a pear tree?
It's not,

1975
01:45:37,421 --> 01:45:40,340
it's a legal life form.
It's a life form,

1976
01:45:40,341 --> 01:45:41,690
it's a plant.
You're allowed to grow it,

1977
01:45:42,090 --> 01:45:44,450
and if you say can't grow it,
you got a corrupt system.

1978
01:45:44,451 --> 01:45:45,284
You got some bullshit law that you 
weaseled in because you greased up some 

1979
01:45:48,981 --> 01:45:51,560
assholes and the other people don't have
as much money as you do.

1980
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:52,533
It's the only reason why that ever 
happens or people are so desperate to 

1981
01:45:55,610 --> 01:45:56,443
get legal weed.
Did they let some dickhead dominate the 

1982
01:45:59,001 --> 01:46:00,740
entire industry?
Some greedy.

1983
01:46:00,741 --> 01:46:01,510
Fuck,
no.

1984
01:46:01,510 --> 01:46:05,150
The deal is it's legal or it's not 
legal.

1985
01:46:05,210 --> 01:46:08,300
Otherwise we're in some sort of a weird 
dictatorship.

1986
01:46:08,570 --> 01:46:11,600
You know this is not.
You can't just dEcide it's legal,

1987
01:46:11,601 --> 01:46:12,980
but you're the only one who gets to make
money.

1988
01:46:13,070 --> 01:46:14,900
Fuck you.
It's a plant.

1989
01:46:15,050 --> 01:46:15,883
That's crazy.
Imagine if you owned all the pine trees 

1990
01:46:18,321 --> 01:46:21,740
in the country.
Don't make my country my pine trees.

1991
01:46:21,741 --> 01:46:23,300
You want to buy pine?
You're buying it from me.

1992
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:25,220
I find you with a fucking christmas 
tree.

1993
01:46:25,221 --> 01:46:27,940
I'll take you out.
It's crazy though.

1994
01:46:27,950 --> 01:46:31,100
What happened last week?
I don't know.

1995
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,860
New york who said he's wanting to 
legalize weed.

1996
01:46:34,130 --> 01:46:35,900
Oh yeah.
He wants to make it recreationally.

1997
01:46:35,901 --> 01:46:38,390
Legal in New York.
Stupid to shoot down.

1998
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:40,430
You should be making money off of it.
It exists.

1999
01:46:40,431 --> 01:46:42,350
No matter what you do.
If you're a capitalist,

2000
01:46:42,351 --> 01:46:44,720
if you're a person who believes in free 
market,

2001
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:47,510
you already have whiskey,
you already have pills.

2002
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,620
People can get high.
They're not so just.

2003
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:51,780
They're just not.
Stop with the child is arguments.

2004
01:46:52,110 --> 01:46:54,660
Give the fucking people freedom and make
money off it.

2005
01:46:54,661 --> 01:46:57,030
You dummies.
That's what everybody should be doing.

2006
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:59,290
They should make it legal and profit off
of and they.

2007
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:02,100
It shouldn't stop with that either.
She'd go to mushrooms,

2008
01:47:02,310 --> 01:47:04,470
should go to a lot of different things.
They should set up clinics,

2009
01:47:04,690 --> 01:47:06,870
set up places where people can go 
through mushroom therapy.

2010
01:47:06,871 --> 01:47:09,210
People that have suffered there coming 
back from the war.

2011
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:12,120
Ptsd,
you know there's,

2012
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:14,220
there's so many different bands for 
depression.

2013
01:47:14,850 --> 01:47:16,790
People that are getting ready to,
to,

2014
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,870
you know,
to pass away.

2015
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:22,650
They have extreme anxiety.
A lot that is alleviated by mushrooms.

2016
01:47:22,830 --> 01:47:23,663
People that have gone through extensive 
cancer treatment and realize their 

2017
01:47:26,461 --> 01:47:27,294
terminal.
One of the best things for these people 

2018
01:47:29,071 --> 01:47:29,904
as mushrooms that helps them ease their 
pain and suffering and their last dying 

2019
01:47:33,601 --> 01:47:34,434
days and it doesn't seem to have any 
negative effects other than the 

2020
01:47:37,501 --> 01:47:39,450
occasional person losing their fucking 
marbles,

2021
01:47:39,451 --> 01:47:40,980
which is going to happen no matter what 
you do.

2022
01:47:41,910 --> 01:47:42,743
It's something that should be studied 
and it's something that should be free 

2023
01:47:45,031 --> 01:47:47,250
and it could benefit people so it should
be fucking legal.

2024
01:47:47,550 --> 01:47:52,550
I think if everYbody modeled with 
colorado's going peoples see it,

2025
01:47:53,570 --> 01:47:54,403
you know,
there's a lot of naysayers and just 

2026
01:47:55,801 --> 01:47:56,634
business.
They don't understand that in Colorado 

2027
01:47:59,221 --> 01:48:01,740
you get tax rebates.
Not only that,

2028
01:48:01,741 --> 01:48:03,480
colorado's real estate went through the 
fucking roof.

2029
01:48:03,850 --> 01:48:05,070
You know,
this is,

2030
01:48:05,670 --> 01:48:09,150
this is something that I hope most 
states go for.

2031
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:11,910
I know that there's a backend angle to 
it.

2032
01:48:11,930 --> 01:48:13,770
It's a gateway drug.
It's this,

2033
01:48:13,771 --> 01:48:16,200
it's that.
It depends what you do with it.

2034
01:48:16,830 --> 01:48:19,350
You know,
I'd only argument is traffic fatalities.

2035
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:24,380
this the only argument and I we had a 
lot of increase in traffic fatalities,

2036
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:30,380
but what I've read is it depends on who 
the problem is.

2037
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:33,600
It's hard to find the study.
That's absolutely correct.

2038
01:48:33,870 --> 01:48:34,703
Some say there's been an increased,
some say the incurrence increase 

2039
01:48:36,930 --> 01:48:39,000
corresponds to the population increase.

2040
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:41,160
I've read that too.
I don't know if that's true,

2041
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:44,100
but that kind of makes sense that if you
get more people in the city,

2042
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:45,890
you're going to have more people 
driving,

2043
01:48:45,891 --> 01:48:47,570
going to have more traffic accidents 
periods.

2044
01:48:47,571 --> 01:48:48,404
So if the number just goes up,
but the population has increased by 14 

2045
01:48:50,881 --> 01:48:54,030
percent or whatever it's done.
That would kind of make sense.

2046
01:48:54,630 --> 01:48:56,760
But also,
let's be honest,

2047
01:48:56,761 --> 01:48:57,594
some people don't drive very well when 
they're high and if you're out there 

2048
01:48:59,911 --> 01:49:02,100
driving high and space now and you're a 
fucking idiot,

2049
01:49:02,310 --> 01:49:05,040
you might slam into a car that's 
entirely possible too.

2050
01:49:05,041 --> 01:49:07,440
And to deny that that's possible.
Seem silly,

2051
01:49:08,130 --> 01:49:09,690
but I think that it's like everything 
else,

2052
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:10,673
there's people that are responsible 
people and there's people that aren't 

2053
01:49:12,570 --> 01:49:13,403
and there's people that are good drivers
and there's people that aren't his 

2054
01:49:15,031 --> 01:49:15,864
people.
That drive is tracted as people that 

2055
01:49:16,861 --> 01:49:17,850
don't pay attention to shit.

2056
01:49:17,850 --> 01:49:19,530
And then there's people that.
do you know,

2057
01:49:19,531 --> 01:49:23,250
whether they're high or sober.
I would rather have you driving a lot of

2058
01:49:23,251 --> 01:49:24,084
people driving sober.
I know you don't fuck with your phone 

2059
01:49:25,621 --> 01:49:27,090
when you're driving.
I've seen you drive,

2060
01:49:27,270 --> 01:49:29,040
you drive,
you take it fucking seriously.

2061
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:30,173
You look around you not.
You're not interested in getting any 

2062
01:49:31,641 --> 01:49:33,660
stupid car accident because you weren't 
paying attention.

2063
01:49:33,870 --> 01:49:34,703
I've seen you drive.
I'll fucking take you high any day of 

2064
01:49:36,571 --> 01:49:39,510
the week.
Idiot was a cell phone addiction.

2065
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:43,410
I drive very defensively.
I watch everything.

2066
01:49:43,470 --> 01:49:45,480
I watch everything coming from all 
angles.

2067
01:49:46,530 --> 01:49:48,100
Especially.
You

2068
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:50,410
have to double check everything when you
drive.

2069
01:49:50,970 --> 01:49:54,620
A dear friend when we lived,
when they leave me got hit by a car dog.

2070
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:55,533
Yeah,
I heard three weeks ago crossing the 

2071
01:49:57,131 --> 01:49:59,830
fucking street.
She broke both her legs.

2072
01:49:59,831 --> 01:50:00,664
Yeah.
I want people to understand that you 

2073
01:50:02,081 --> 01:50:06,640
have to have your eyes open and I don't 
take nothing for granted.

2074
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:10,510
I don't care if that guy's stopping 
there when I'm making that right.

2075
01:50:10,570 --> 01:50:11,403
I'm watching that motherfucker.
Plus I got to watch for pedestrians 

2076
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:17,250
because they will walk out.
Anyway.

2077
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:19,930
Next thing that you drag them a guide 
three fucking blocks.

2078
01:50:20,020 --> 01:50:22,270
So I did not know the window was hit by 
a car.

2079
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:24,190
Was in a car accident?
No,

2080
01:50:25,220 --> 01:50:27,850
she was,
there was no right away.

2081
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:28,713
The whole thing.
I mean somebody was telling me the 

2082
01:50:29,681 --> 01:50:30,514
story.
I mean it was just you have to pay 

2083
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:36,700
fucking attention.
So I drive.

2084
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:37,533
There's only a little New York and my 
drive is only a little New York and my 

2085
01:50:41,411 --> 01:50:42,244
drive number two,
I drive away from people I to take the 

2086
01:50:44,621 --> 01:50:45,454
two or three colleagues.
I never did that till about 10 years 

2087
01:50:48,011 --> 01:50:48,700
ago.
Larry.

2088
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:52,270
Or is it somebody you know,
you're,

2089
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:52,900
you're,
you're,

2090
01:50:52,900 --> 01:50:53,733
you were driving in a place where you 
have to assume unless you fucking 

2091
01:50:59,020 --> 01:50:59,853
stupid.
That 30 percent of the people for the 

2092
01:51:02,771 --> 01:51:03,604
last 10 years have been driving high.
Then you gotta add another 20 percent 

2093
01:51:08,770 --> 01:51:13,770
for people that are texting and driving.
Then you gotta add another 10 percent of

2094
01:51:13,871 --> 01:51:17,620
people are just visiting it and looking 
around going,

2095
01:51:17,621 --> 01:51:19,840
oh my god,
look how beautiful California is.

2096
01:51:20,410 --> 01:51:21,243
It's a fuck.
Every time you get in the car you have 

2097
01:51:23,861 --> 01:51:28,210
to drive a certain way.
Was it how I thought 20 years ago?

2098
01:51:28,211 --> 01:51:29,230
No,
I want to get that.

2099
01:51:29,740 --> 01:51:34,480
Why do you think I'm against high speed?
Cause I want to do 90 joe,

2100
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:37,710
I'm getting a porsche,
I'm doing nothing.

2101
01:51:37,830 --> 01:51:41,440
I ripped the ticket up.
You give me a ticket.

2102
01:51:41,441 --> 01:51:42,274
I'm ripping it.
I knew you were going to get one of 

2103
01:51:43,181 --> 01:51:45,980
those cadillacs for awhile,
but you decided not to because I got.

2104
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:50,080
I got a for you ever see my feet,
my foot just very large.

2105
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:52,540
They're very large and once they rest on
you,

2106
01:51:52,541 --> 01:51:57,541
it's 90 on that gas pedal.
I made it to san diego and back.

2107
01:51:59,530 --> 01:52:00,450
Don't say anybody.
Don't.

2108
01:52:00,670 --> 01:52:03,070
Don't tell me.
I tell people the secret.

2109
01:52:03,071 --> 01:52:03,904
It's not illegal.
I'm sick and tired of people coming to 

2110
01:52:06,161 --> 01:52:07,240
me going,
oh my god.

2111
01:52:07,660 --> 01:52:10,750
The drive to san diego was horrific.
What time did you go?

2112
01:52:11,050 --> 01:52:11,883
One of the afternoon.
Can I smack you down or should I smack 

2113
01:52:14,891 --> 01:52:15,820
in the mouth later?

2114
01:52:16,210 --> 01:52:18,160
That's four hours.
That's three and a half.

2115
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:20,200
But isn't that crazy that it takes that 
long?

2116
01:52:20,380 --> 01:52:21,213
But if you get in your car at nine and 
you do fucking 80 because all you need 

2117
01:52:26,711 --> 01:52:30,880
to do is get out of la.
Once you pass the commerce casino,

2118
01:52:31,650 --> 01:52:34,300
it's a river dirty.
Nobody gives a frenchmans fuck.

2119
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:39,130
You stay in that second to left lane and
you're just doing 75 baby.

2120
01:52:39,970 --> 01:52:44,970
It's an hour an hour.
40th five on the way back.

2121
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:48,350
Made it from la jolla and our 30.
Whoa,

2122
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:50,180
because I.
That's easy wrap.

2123
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:55,040
Soon as you hit the five north,
you're banging out the hallway quick all

2124
01:52:55,041 --> 01:52:57,770
the way to camp pendleton,
navy.

2125
01:52:57,800 --> 01:52:59,330
You know what I'm saying?
You don't give a fuck.

2126
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:02,630
You fucking serious on its nobody out 
there.

2127
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:03,793
It's a weird hair and I know too,
when you're coming back from san diego 

2128
01:53:05,931 --> 01:53:08,470
says military zen,
you're hitting 80,

2129
01:53:08,471 --> 01:53:09,291
80,
80,

2130
01:53:09,291 --> 01:53:10,124
80,
80.

2131
01:53:10,430 --> 01:53:11,263
Then when the road starts to thin,
that means you're about to hit 

2132
01:53:13,761 --> 01:53:14,594
immigration.
They're going to ask you if you got an 

2133
01:53:15,370 --> 01:53:16,203
unregistered that never out there.
Those motherfuckers happened without 

2134
01:53:19,990 --> 01:53:21,290
this nine slash 11.
Right?

2135
01:53:21,690 --> 01:53:23,780
You just,
once I hit that point,

2136
01:53:24,290 --> 01:53:29,290
I kicked it to 100 till I hit irvine.
Once I hit irvine spectrum,

2137
01:53:30,170 --> 01:53:32,120
I come down to about 80,
80,

2138
01:53:32,121 --> 01:53:32,990
80,
80,

2139
01:53:33,310 --> 01:53:37,040
and then I see la 19 miles back up to 
100,

2140
01:53:37,041 --> 01:53:38,930
but then you're going to hit traffic.
Oh my goodness.

2141
01:53:38,931 --> 01:53:41,990
You're going to hit the 10 to five.
Everybody's it up.

2142
01:53:41,991 --> 01:53:45,380
You get on the one on one,
but then I get back on that one.

2143
01:53:45,381 --> 01:53:50,381
Thirty 4:34
and the five goes until 1:34

2144
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,710
and next thing you know your own no 
drama.

2145
01:53:55,430 --> 01:53:58,640
the night driving from san diego.
It was the way to do it.

2146
01:53:59,180 --> 01:54:00,013
Yeah,
definitely want to drive home after the 

2147
01:54:01,041 --> 01:54:01,250
kid.

2148
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:02,700
You don't want to wait for the morning.
Fuck.

2149
01:54:03,050 --> 01:54:04,970
sometimes you're so tired.
You're scared.

2150
01:54:05,160 --> 01:54:06,110
No,
no.

2151
01:54:06,111 --> 01:54:09,200
That morning,
that morning and two hours.

2152
01:54:09,201 --> 01:54:10,034
No,
you stopped yourself a nice coffee and 

2153
01:54:13,641 --> 01:54:16,340
you fucking zang it all the way back to 
loss.

2154
01:54:16,420 --> 01:54:17,061
No,
you're righT.

2155
01:54:17,061 --> 01:54:19,000
That's what you definitely should do.
But man,

2156
01:54:19,180 --> 01:54:20,013
you know the the key for folks who you 
worry about falling asleep in your car 

2157
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:24,433
while you're driving,
get a rag or a tee shirt and get some 

2158
01:54:26,691 --> 01:54:27,524
ice.
It's the best wet rag with ice in it is 

2159
01:54:30,501 --> 01:54:31,334
the best.
Just rub it on your face real quick and 

2160
01:54:32,961 --> 01:54:33,794
you wakes you right the fuck up and it 
lasts for a few minutes and just do it 

2161
01:54:35,811 --> 01:54:36,644
again a few minutes later and you'll be 
fine the whole way home if you can keep 

2162
01:54:39,141 --> 01:54:39,974
ice and uh,
uh,

2163
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:42,830
like a wash cloth or something like that
with ice in it and it gets wet.

2164
01:54:42,950 --> 01:54:45,440
JusT keep rubbing your face.
It's better than anything.

2165
01:54:45,441 --> 01:54:49,040
I useD to smack myself in the face when 
I was getting up early in the morning to

2166
01:54:49,041 --> 01:54:51,430
do newspapers.
I was delivering newspapers.

2167
01:54:51,450 --> 01:54:54,170
Then I would do gigs at night.
I was fucking tired,

2168
01:54:54,171 --> 01:54:55,700
man.
And I'd be coming back,

2169
01:54:55,830 --> 01:54:56,663
you know,
at midnight from thiS gig and I knew I 

2170
01:54:57,891 --> 01:54:58,724
had to get up at 5:00
AM to deliver newspapers depending upon 

2171
01:55:00,831 --> 01:55:01,664
the day.
And I would just smack myself in the 

2172
01:55:03,951 --> 01:55:05,780
face because I was falling asleep at the
wheel.

2173
01:55:06,170 --> 01:55:07,003
I would just feel my eyes getting heavy 
and I'm opening them up and I couldn't 

2174
01:55:09,861 --> 01:55:10,694
keep it.
I just fucking whack whack yourself in 

2175
01:55:12,771 --> 01:55:15,680
the face.
It lasts for like a couple of minutes.

2176
01:55:15,710 --> 01:55:16,543
Like you're like,
gee,

2177
01:55:17,140 --> 01:55:19,040
I would just,
my whole face would be stinging,

2178
01:55:19,380 --> 01:55:20,213
you know,
it's like seriously slap myself really 

2179
01:55:21,881 --> 01:55:25,790
hard in the face.
I will never fucking coffee guy.

2180
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:31,220
Like as a kid I mangled and cuban coffee
straight away from it.

2181
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:32,713
So when I first started triple runs,
I wouldn't have my kid at two in the 

2182
01:55:36,261 --> 01:55:40,400
afternoon on sunday and I would get off 
stage and boise,

2183
01:55:40,401 --> 01:55:43,680
Idaho at 1130 on

2184
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:47,720
my car would be filled with gas and I 
get it.

2185
01:55:47,860 --> 01:55:51,030
I didn't have four or five bills,
no dogs.

2186
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:54,480
And I would go to a gas station and get 
the biggest mountain.

2187
01:55:54,481 --> 01:55:59,130
Do they ever had an airline?
And that would go for six hours.

2188
01:55:59,131 --> 01:55:59,964
I would eat no doz,
but one of the worst experiences I ever 

2189
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:07,960
had was I was falling asleep like I was 
done and it was fucking 10 below zero,

2190
01:56:08,840 --> 01:56:09,673
you know?
And I pulled over on the side of the 

2191
01:56:10,981 --> 01:56:13,440
road.
I turned my lights on,

2192
01:56:13,590 --> 01:56:14,423
I put the brake lights on,
I kicked the seat back and laid down 

2193
01:56:17,941 --> 01:56:20,190
with the heat blasting and the car was 
on.

2194
01:56:21,180 --> 01:56:26,180
And at one point sharon and I opened up 
my eyes and I thought I had lost control

2195
01:56:26,501 --> 01:56:29,070
of the call.
In your mind,

2196
01:56:29,071 --> 01:56:32,250
you feel like if I lose.
And I remember holding onto the steering

2197
01:56:32,251 --> 01:56:33,084
wheel,
he has my heart almost stopped and 

2198
01:56:34,831 --> 01:56:36,800
going,
thank god and get fucking hit here.

2199
01:56:37,570 --> 01:56:41,520
well that was a no dose.
This is way before red bull,

2200
01:56:41,521 --> 01:56:43,110
red bull,
whatever that shit is.

2201
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:48,450
But I still remember doing coke all 
night and shooting a short film fox.

2202
01:56:49,530 --> 01:56:53,040
And I'll never forget the fucking.
They gave me two red bulls.

2203
01:56:53,041 --> 01:56:55,780
I drank two of them and I still fell 
asleep and I.

2204
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:57,110
This is that.
I go red bull.

2205
01:56:58,620 --> 01:57:00,100
The fuck is a red bull.

2206
01:57:02,470 --> 01:57:07,470
I'm going to fucking red bull onto dick.
What do you think it is,

2207
01:57:08,011 --> 01:57:09,510
John Jones?
Shit that's going on.

2208
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:12,000
Do you know what's happened?
The ufc is moving from vegas.

2209
01:57:12,001 --> 01:57:15,600
So this last night when I got home from 
the comedy store,

2210
01:57:15,601 --> 01:57:16,560
break it down for me.

2211
01:57:16,950 --> 01:57:19,890
Jeff novitsky.
Come on and break it down scientifically

2212
01:57:19,891 --> 01:57:22,140
on thursday.
A lot of people are calling bullshit,

2213
01:57:22,380 --> 01:57:23,213
including daniel.

2214
01:57:24,130 --> 01:57:25,780
I talked to call me on the phone.
He was like,

2215
01:57:26,050 --> 01:57:28,780
he tested positive again,
can you believe this shit?

2216
01:57:28,990 --> 01:57:31,810
And they get a little fight.
I found out about it from cormay me.

2217
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:33,760
He told them they're going to move the 
flight to la.

2218
01:57:33,761 --> 01:57:34,361
I go,
no.

2219
01:57:34,361 --> 01:57:35,021
He goes,
yes,

2220
01:57:35,021 --> 01:57:36,640
joe,
that move With the fight down.

2221
01:57:36,650 --> 01:57:38,320
I'm like,
no,

2222
01:57:38,350 --> 01:57:42,370
this can't be real.
it didn't seem real like I don't believe

2223
01:57:42,371 --> 01:57:44,020
this.
I looked at his core age,

2224
01:57:44,050 --> 01:57:49,050
twitter and I said he tested positive 
again and then I looked at when,

2225
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:52,510
what this is like first thing in the 
morning and he's like,

2226
01:57:52,511 --> 01:57:55,240
keep ti again again,

2227
01:57:55,540 --> 01:57:56,373
but from what I understand from reading,
ariel helwani is a transcript of his 

2228
01:58:01,571 --> 01:58:02,404
interview with andy foster and hearing 
what jeff novitsky has had to say about 

2229
01:58:07,451 --> 01:58:10,620
it.
What it is is the numb the.

2230
01:58:10,750 --> 01:58:11,583
The amount of it is so infinite decimal 
and it's the exact same metabolite that 

2231
01:58:17,051 --> 01:58:17,884
he had been screened for that he tested 
positive for a year ago and that this 

2232
01:58:22,001 --> 01:58:27,001
shit could stay in a system in those 
kind of sizes of the molecule.

2233
01:58:27,341 --> 01:58:28,174
It's like some $500,
million of a grain of sand or something 

2234
01:58:31,181 --> 01:58:35,270
like that.
Google what the actual number of the cow

2235
01:58:35,271 --> 01:58:36,104
small molecule is,
so andy foster has said again this 

2236
01:58:41,411 --> 01:58:42,244
transcription of this interview that he 
did with ariel helwani that it's the 

2237
01:58:45,101 --> 01:58:45,934
same metabolite for the same substance 
they tested positive for that is as the 

2238
01:58:49,661 --> 01:58:50,494
same instance that the,
the number of it and it indicates that 

2239
01:58:55,241 --> 01:58:57,490
this is something he's already been 
punished for.

2240
01:58:57,610 --> 01:58:58,443
The same exact.
He's already gone through his steps and 

2241
01:59:01,181 --> 01:59:05,050
this is just an infant testimony,
small metaBolite.

2242
01:59:05,710 --> 01:59:06,543
That's what I'm hearing.
So I would love to hear someone who 

2243
01:59:10,091 --> 01:59:10,924
doesn't think that that's the case,
that thinks there might be some way to 

2244
01:59:13,631 --> 01:59:14,464
game the system and the big thought that
people always bring up when it comes to 

2245
01:59:17,921 --> 01:59:21,220
this stuff as micro dosing.
Someone micro dosing like you're the one

2246
01:59:21,221 --> 01:59:22,054
who told me about that first.
You were telling me about a somebody 

2247
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:29,550
Alex Rodriguez who is taking a gummy 
bear testosterone and he was so he would

2248
01:59:31,661 --> 01:59:34,900
be up for the seventh,
eighth and ninth inning,

2249
01:59:35,770 --> 01:59:38,800
but by the time the 10th and then came,
if they tested him,

2250
01:59:39,370 --> 01:59:43,780
it would be out of the system.
So I would imagine the testing is better

2251
01:59:43,781 --> 01:59:46,900
now and this is one of the things is 
that novitsky wants to get into that.

2252
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:47,753
The testing is far superior now,
so you're able to piCk up these 

2253
01:59:51,041 --> 01:59:53,770
metabolites in much,
much smaller quantities.

2254
01:59:53,940 --> 01:59:56,820
So this is.
So this test is from december nine.

2255
01:59:57,490 --> 01:59:58,323
Yeah.
I want to see what his tech here it is 

2256
02:00:00,700 --> 02:00:01,533
leading up to that apparently was 
cleaned before that said we were 

2257
02:00:04,631 --> 02:00:05,464
notified early this month.
Have an issue he has had over his most 

2258
02:00:07,691 --> 02:00:09,310
recent tests were very small amount.
I'll,

2259
02:00:09,350 --> 02:00:13,950
I'll pack describe how small it is.
A of a longterm,

2260
02:00:13,951 --> 02:00:18,951
a tablet substance called d h empty,
known as oral terryn Nepal trendable,

2261
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:24,800
which is the reason for his most recent 
suspension a year and a half ago.

2262
02:00:24,801 --> 02:00:26,500
A very,
very small amounT.

2263
02:00:26,740 --> 02:00:27,980
But there was a number that.

2264
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:33,400
Where does it say the number?
There was an ak rife or.

2265
02:00:33,670 --> 02:00:35,950
Yeah,
something like how much smaller.

2266
02:00:35,951 --> 02:00:38,440
It isn't a grain of rice is it?
Can't find it.

2267
02:00:38,780 --> 02:00:40,510
I'm just trying to find it.
Um,

2268
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:42,513
yeah.
Look,

2269
02:00:42,550 --> 02:00:46,840
I get how everybody would be fuck and 
pissed.

2270
02:00:47,260 --> 02:00:50,350
I get how everybody would think that 
he's a cheater.

2271
02:00:50,351 --> 02:00:53,470
He's cheating again.
I get the you would think that,

2272
02:00:54,190 --> 02:00:57,040
but I don't know if that's true and if 
it's not true,

2273
02:00:57,070 --> 02:00:57,903
it would be ashamed to accuse him of it.
If it is the same stuff that was in his 

2274
02:01:02,171 --> 02:01:05,230
system that was ruled to be from a 
tainted supplement.

2275
02:01:06,130 --> 02:01:10,780
Here it is.
A pickle is 1000000000000th of a gram.

2276
02:01:10,781 --> 02:01:11,614
Novitsky said if you put one grain of 
salt on the table and split it up into 

2277
02:01:15,461 --> 02:01:18,680
$50 million pieces,
a pickle.

2278
02:01:18,681 --> 02:01:22,120
Graham is one of those pieces of that 
gram of salt,

2279
02:01:22,810 --> 02:01:23,643
which is insane.

2280
02:01:24,160 --> 02:01:27,840
so that grain of salt,
it's a $50,

2281
02:01:27,850 --> 02:01:29,590
million times larger or smaller than 
that.

2282
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:31,110
It's crAzy.
So it's very,

2283
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:31,571
very,
very,

2284
02:01:31,571 --> 02:01:36,130
very small.
So if this is true and they believe it's

2285
02:01:36,131 --> 02:01:36,964
true,
and the guy who runs California state 

2286
02:01:38,501 --> 02:01:40,310
athletic commission,
andy foster,

2287
02:01:40,550 --> 02:01:42,620
I have a great,
great deal.

2288
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:44,420
Tremendous amount of respect for that 
guy.

2289
02:01:44,820 --> 02:01:48,640
Very proactive with weight cutting,
very proactive with weight classes,

2290
02:01:48,650 --> 02:01:51,350
very proactive with a lot of the rules.
He's really good.

2291
02:01:51,740 --> 02:01:52,573
If he believes that this is 
scientifically been proven to be from 

2292
02:01:55,341 --> 02:01:58,670
the same exact thing that he already 
been punished for,

2293
02:01:59,240 --> 02:02:02,360
I agree with them.
I just that that guy knows what the fuck

2294
02:02:02,361 --> 02:02:05,090
he's talking about and he's legit.
So as novitsky.

2295
02:02:05,150 --> 02:02:07,130
So are these people that are all saying 
that it's legit.

2296
02:02:07,550 --> 02:02:08,383
Here's the question though,
have other people been still punished 

2297
02:02:13,430 --> 02:02:18,050
for the exact same crime?
Have other people tested positive?

2298
02:02:18,050 --> 02:02:18,883
Again for the exact same thing?
This I do not know and I don't know if 

2299
02:02:22,461 --> 02:02:25,640
people are looking into that.
If there is any preferential treatment,

2300
02:02:25,910 --> 02:02:27,260
that would be where the argument would 
be.

2301
02:02:27,710 --> 02:02:30,080
Preferential treatment is fucking 
tainted.

2302
02:02:30,081 --> 02:02:30,914
Supplements are legItimate problem.
I mean novitsky showed us hundreds and 

2303
02:02:35,570 --> 02:02:39,170
hundreds of supplements you could buy at
any store that has,

2304
02:02:39,190 --> 02:02:40,023
you know,
vitamins and muscle builders and all 

2305
02:02:42,291 --> 02:02:44,990
those kinds of things that test positive
for steroids.

2306
02:02:44,991 --> 02:02:47,030
There's a shit ton of them out there,
man.

2307
02:02:47,330 --> 02:02:49,750
You can get a lot of stuff in these 
systems.

2308
02:02:49,790 --> 02:02:52,640
But then there's also people that are 
taking steroids.

2309
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:55,600
So how do you know who the only way to 
find out who's,

2310
02:02:55,610 --> 02:02:56,690
who is,
don't take shit,

2311
02:02:56,900 --> 02:02:57,733
don't take anything unless it's third 
party tests that don't take anything 

2312
02:02:59,901 --> 02:03:02,000
controversial,
don't take anything squirrely.

2313
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:06,770
And sometimes people do and it's fucked 
up that you know,

2314
02:03:06,771 --> 02:03:08,330
they,
mayBe they lack a supplement,

2315
02:03:08,570 --> 02:03:11,450
maybe they've had good results with it 
and then they get one bad batch.

2316
02:03:11,450 --> 02:03:14,780
That's possible too.
I just wanted to know that this was from

2317
02:03:14,781 --> 02:03:15,614
December 9th.
I want to know what the levels of that 

2318
02:03:18,351 --> 02:03:23,351
drug they found where before the summer 
night it takes a long time ago.

2319
02:03:23,790 --> 02:03:26,590
Well I understand so,
but every time your urine,

2320
02:03:27,060 --> 02:03:29,300
the level should get lower,
lower,

2321
02:03:29,430 --> 02:03:30,263
lower.
I think what they're saying is this is 

2322
02:03:32,361 --> 02:03:33,194
the lowest detectable number.
So there's no lower than they should 

2323
02:03:36,861 --> 02:03:40,220
have found this before.
Maybe not higher.

2324
02:03:40,510 --> 02:03:41,450
Maybe.
Maybe not.

2325
02:03:41,451 --> 02:03:44,820
Depending on the city is numbers.
The way it's been explained to me,

2326
02:03:44,821 --> 02:03:46,370
and again,
I'm not a fucking scientist,

2327
02:03:46,670 --> 02:03:47,503
but the way it's been explained to me 
this number is so small that it could 

2328
02:03:50,241 --> 02:03:54,230
conceivably be tested in one test and 
not tested another test.

2329
02:03:54,440 --> 02:03:58,610
And then also as the testing procedures 
get more and more thorough,

2330
02:03:58,760 --> 02:03:59,593
they get better at it.
They're detecting things they couldn't 

2331
02:04:01,431 --> 02:04:02,264
detect.
maybe even just a year ago I gets 

2332
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:07,490
continued.
The the technology is continuing to grow

2333
02:04:07,670 --> 02:04:11,090
and they're getting much better at 
understanding how to use it and how to.

2334
02:04:11,140 --> 02:04:11,973
How to advance it.
so it's not as simple as you test 

2335
02:04:14,361 --> 02:04:17,930
positive a year ago,
you test negative today like they.

2336
02:04:17,980 --> 02:04:18,813
They might have better methods of 
detection today than they had a year 

2337
02:04:21,950 --> 02:04:23,090
ago.
You've got arrested today.

2338
02:04:23,140 --> 02:04:26,480
Joel judge is going to say,
joe rogan,

2339
02:04:26,481 --> 02:04:27,314
I'm released on bail,
but the da wants you to take a urine 

2340
02:04:30,350 --> 02:04:33,350
test.
Samples come back dirty.

2341
02:04:33,980 --> 02:04:38,070
The first year was free.
They know who joe is going to go

2342
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:40,500
in there and you're thc levels are going
to be off the chain.

2343
02:04:41,310 --> 02:04:43,950
This is going to be off the chain.
This is going to be up to chain.

2344
02:04:44,490 --> 02:04:45,323
When they come back,
they're going to coin and they don't 

2345
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:49,350
know joe rogan.
This is what it was.

2346
02:04:49,351 --> 02:04:50,184
Now this is this.
The next time we test you behind in 26 

2347
02:04:55,441 --> 02:04:59,280
percent because we know you're using.
This is in 1997.

2348
02:04:59,420 --> 02:05:00,253
The lady told me,
I'll know if you use that and I stayed 

2349
02:05:03,811 --> 02:05:05,760
through the program and I went down,
down,

2350
02:05:05,761 --> 02:05:06,331
down,
down,

2351
02:05:06,331 --> 02:05:07,164
down,
and then I joined the voluntary group 

2352
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:15,200
and my buddy sent me an eighth of weed 
and I remember smoking a joint and going

2353
02:05:15,481 --> 02:05:19,950
back and the guys like dog.
Did you smoke a joint before you came in

2354
02:05:19,951 --> 02:05:23,040
for the test?
It was like levels.

2355
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:28,670
ThIs is I'm telling you about this.
This is

2356
02:05:28,820 --> 02:05:29,653
funny joke and whatever,
but I want to see the test before the 

2357
02:05:32,631 --> 02:05:36,440
ninth and I want to see the test.
The most recent test,

2358
02:05:37,010 --> 02:05:38,510
those levels had to go down.

2359
02:05:38,830 --> 02:05:39,663
I do.
I understand what you're saying to us 

2360
02:05:41,290 --> 02:05:42,340
necessarily.
Correct.

2361
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:47,360
Unless he did the steroid during non 
competition season,

2362
02:05:47,660 --> 02:05:49,380
which they're allowed to do whatever the
fuck.

2363
02:05:49,580 --> 02:05:50,200
No,
they're not.

2364
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:52,360
That's not true.
They never know what they know.

2365
02:05:52,380 --> 02:05:55,390
They can never take steroids.
There's a banned list of things they can

2366
02:05:55,391 --> 02:05:58,630
never ever have in their system.
They say if you're up fighting,

2367
02:05:58,960 --> 02:05:59,860
they'll still test.
You.

2368
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:02,500
Say if you don't have a camp,
you're not in camp,

2369
02:06:02,501 --> 02:06:05,980
you don't have a bout lined up.
They still still tested joey diaz.

2370
02:06:05,981 --> 02:06:07,570
How are you?
Come on in the bathroom.

2371
02:06:07,750 --> 02:06:08,583
We're going to get some get some fluids 
from you now I don't know if they using 

2372
02:06:11,110 --> 02:06:15,880
just urine or if urine and blood.
I'm not sure what the protocol,

2373
02:06:15,881 --> 02:06:16,714
but I do know that it's very thorough 
and they're catching people for things 

2374
02:06:19,361 --> 02:06:21,130
that they would have never caught them 
for in the past,

2375
02:06:21,430 --> 02:06:24,010
and this is one of the things about this
test.

2376
02:06:24,310 --> 02:06:28,030
It could possibly be as it's been 
explained to me that this,

2377
02:06:28,050 --> 02:06:28,883
this number is so fucking small that 
they might not even been able to detect 

2378
02:06:33,551 --> 02:06:37,090
it a year ago at this number,
this insanely small number.

2379
02:06:37,210 --> 02:06:38,043
There's new levels of detection now.
Whereas he would be completely negative 

2380
02:06:42,040 --> 02:06:45,910
x amount of time in the past.
Now they can test it and they could find

2381
02:06:45,911 --> 02:06:50,890
that insanely 50 million of a grain of 
salt size particle.

2382
02:06:50,910 --> 02:06:51,743
It's.
It's so fucking small that they weren't 

2383
02:06:53,711 --> 02:06:57,160
able to catch something like that x 
amount of time in the past,

2384
02:06:57,161 --> 02:06:57,994
whether it's a year ago or two years,
but now they can and then the future 

2385
02:06:59,801 --> 02:07:00,634
it's going to be even better.
They're going to keep getting better at 

2386
02:07:01,841 --> 02:07:03,460
this stuff as they advanced the 
technology.

2387
02:07:03,670 --> 02:07:05,710
That's,
as it's been explained to me,

2388
02:07:05,770 --> 02:07:06,603
what you're seeing heRe,
what you're seeing here is not evidence 

2389
02:07:08,951 --> 02:07:09,784
of new drug use.
It's evidence that the testing is far 

2390
02:07:13,001 --> 02:07:17,260
better and that he has the exact same 
metabolite anD he definitely did have it

2391
02:07:17,261 --> 02:07:20,780
in the system because they're finding it
a year later in these te,

2392
02:07:20,781 --> 02:07:21,471
te,
te,

2393
02:07:21,471 --> 02:07:22,600
te,
te tiny amount.

2394
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:24,100
His body hasn't completely gotten rid of
it yet.

2395
02:07:24,300 --> 02:07:25,133
Still in there.
The question is how long has that stuff 

2396
02:07:26,981 --> 02:07:30,760
stays in your system?
They've said through normal detection,

2397
02:07:31,120 --> 02:07:33,700
I believe google this,
make sure this is correct,

2398
02:07:33,940 --> 02:07:36,070
but through normal,
what's not?

2399
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:40,210
I mean from whatever the time they.
They wrote this stuff out.

2400
02:07:40,980 --> 02:07:43,840
I believe they were saying it can be 
detected up to 18 months,

2401
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:45,453
but again,
as this technology gets better and they 

2402
02:07:47,621 --> 02:07:49,930
can detect smaller and smaller 
particles,

2403
02:07:50,140 --> 02:07:52,810
it's potentially possible that that 
might extend.

2404
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:53,913
So you might not just be 18 months,
it might be 19 or 20 or who knows how 

2405
02:07:56,861 --> 02:07:58,450
long it takes for your body to get rid 
of that shit.

2406
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:02,350
The other guys like columbia and 
gustafson and guys,

2407
02:08:02,490 --> 02:08:03,323
you know,
they look at this is where there's 

2408
02:08:06,101 --> 02:08:07,080
smoke,
there's fire.

2409
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:08,360
Yes.
You know,

2410
02:08:08,620 --> 02:08:10,630
and they have a point to.
They have a point though,

2411
02:08:10,631 --> 02:08:15,631
so I'm not mad at them for that.
I'm a big fan of the show of John Jones.

2412
02:08:15,730 --> 02:08:16,810
Personally.
I am too.

2413
02:08:18,550 --> 02:08:21,270
For what he does.
I love him to death and I saw him at the

2414
02:08:21,271 --> 02:08:23,500
albuquerque game show.
We lacked.

2415
02:08:25,660 --> 02:08:28,870
I don't think,
I don't know what to think anymore.

2416
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:31,120
You know,
I don't know what to think.

2417
02:08:31,870 --> 02:08:33,720
This one really,
you know,

2418
02:08:34,570 --> 02:08:38,920
and I feel bad at you and I both know 
this is the card of the year.

2419
02:08:39,290 --> 02:08:40,123
It's a phenoMenal cause.
The card when peOple fly in and then 

2420
02:08:43,871 --> 02:08:47,440
make plans around that and they do a 
bunch of stuff around it.

2421
02:08:47,950 --> 02:08:51,280
I feel bad for those people.
I know what this is like for them.

2422
02:08:51,281 --> 02:08:53,530
They just lost this saturday night 
activity.

2423
02:08:53,670 --> 02:08:54,503
Well in vegas it takes a big hit too 
because this was going to be taking 

2424
02:08:57,091 --> 02:08:57,924
place in vegas.
All those people are going to be in 

2425
02:08:58,711 --> 02:08:59,544
town.
It's gonna be a tremendous amount of 

2426
02:09:00,781 --> 02:09:04,680
money for the casinos and you know,
I'm sure it was a lot of money for them.

2427
02:09:04,681 --> 02:09:07,560
There is a big thing to have there and a
bigger arena,

2428
02:09:07,830 --> 02:09:10,290
so they're moving it to the forum which 
is a smaller place.

2429
02:09:10,710 --> 02:09:11,970
The foreman,
inglewood is,

2430
02:09:12,600 --> 02:09:15,360
I don't know how much smaller it is,
the tb mobile arena,

2431
02:09:15,430 --> 02:09:16,263
but he said he was a.
Dana was saying he could make about 

2432
02:09:18,941 --> 02:09:19,774
$6,000,000
on the gate at and t mobile arena and 

2433
02:09:21,401 --> 02:09:23,470
he's going to be lucky to make a million
in the forum.

2434
02:09:23,700 --> 02:09:25,500
That makes sense.
It's just,

2435
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:26,553
it's different prices to in vegas and 
also the fact that it's such short 

2436
02:09:28,770 --> 02:09:29,603
timing.
I don't know what they do with the 

2437
02:09:30,481 --> 02:09:32,610
original tickets.
I don't know how it works.

2438
02:09:33,120 --> 02:09:36,060
This is what happened.
The very first ufc I ever did,

2439
02:09:36,240 --> 02:09:38,460
the very first ufc ever work was in 
dothan,

2440
02:09:38,461 --> 02:09:39,930
Alabama,
ufc 12,

2441
02:09:40,050 --> 02:09:41,430
but was supposed to be in New York 
state.

2442
02:09:41,790 --> 02:09:43,620
They cAncelled It in New York state that
would let them do it.

2443
02:09:43,621 --> 02:09:44,290
And they,
they,

2444
02:09:44,290 --> 02:09:47,400
they switched the whole thing overnight 
down to dothan,

2445
02:09:47,401 --> 02:09:49,880
Alabama wouldn't take one of them 
helicopter plane

2446
02:09:52,280 --> 02:09:54,470
and flying a fucking dope.
And it was weird.

2447
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:56,030
It was weird back then,
man.

2448
02:09:56,840 --> 02:09:57,673
But that's,
uh,

2449
02:09:57,750 --> 02:10:00,980
that's the only time I've ever heard of 
something changing this close to.

2450
02:10:01,010 --> 02:10:03,170
That was one day.
This is one week.

2451
02:10:03,171 --> 02:10:05,240
I've never heard of an event changing 
like this before.

2452
02:10:05,330 --> 02:10:09,080
Not that I can remember.
I don't know what the fuck is happening.

2453
02:10:09,200 --> 02:10:12,410
I really don't.
But they seem very confident that you're

2454
02:10:12,411 --> 02:10:15,830
not dealing with someone who's taking a 
drug.

2455
02:10:15,831 --> 02:10:16,664
Again,
you're dealing with the very same drug 

2456
02:10:18,531 --> 02:10:19,364
that he took x amount of months ago.
Still in a system the drug has already 

2457
02:10:23,031 --> 02:10:26,330
been punished for.
I understand that people get mad,

2458
02:10:26,570 --> 02:10:28,040
but um,
you,

2459
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:32,720
you don't want to accuse someone of 
something that they're not really guilty

2460
02:10:32,721 --> 02:10:33,554
of.
He's definitely guilty of taking it the 

2461
02:10:34,851 --> 02:10:38,150
first time.
People are accusing them of being stupid

2462
02:10:38,151 --> 02:10:41,180
and taking it again.
I don't think that's true.

2463
02:10:41,510 --> 02:10:46,510
I don't know for a fact,
but what I'm reading from actual experts

2464
02:10:47,120 --> 02:10:50,480
leads me to believe that they're making 
sense,

2465
02:10:52,190 --> 02:10:53,023
but I would have to,
I'd have to talk to someone who 

2466
02:10:54,441 --> 02:10:55,274
disagrees,
who knows more about it than me to 

2467
02:10:56,571 --> 02:10:59,060
really form an opinion.
So my opinion is like,

2468
02:10:59,061 --> 02:11:00,200
wow,
if I had to Bet,

2469
02:11:00,440 --> 02:11:02,150
I would say he probably didn't do 
anything,

2470
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:03,313
but I would like to talk to someone 
who's like a real fucking expert who 

2471
02:11:06,651 --> 02:11:09,290
could break down exactly what the 
process is,

2472
02:11:09,291 --> 02:11:10,124
who can tell you if it is even possible 
that this could be from another 

2473
02:11:13,431 --> 02:11:14,700
ingestion somewhere along.

2474
02:11:15,600 --> 02:11:16,433
The sad,
sad thing about this whole situation is 

2475
02:11:20,860 --> 02:11:25,860
what they really,
really from the bottom was a great card.

2476
02:11:26,610 --> 02:11:27,361
Oh,
it's a great car.

2477
02:11:27,361 --> 02:11:30,720
Even when bj penn is on the car that 
nobody even talks about it.

2478
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:33,840
You mentioned bj penn.
Well,

2479
02:11:33,870 --> 02:11:35,430
you know,
bj's tough fights.

2480
02:11:35,460 --> 02:11:38,350
I was looking for carlos and michael,
uh,

2481
02:11:38,360 --> 02:11:39,630
you know,
uh,

2482
02:11:39,700 --> 02:11:44,700
Amanda Nunez and cyborg.
I haven't slept for a week trying to put

2483
02:11:46,491 --> 02:11:47,324
the car down.
The figure that fly that jon jones 

2484
02:11:49,471 --> 02:11:53,430
gusteson just to look at it.
Let's pretend it's still in vegas.

2485
02:11:53,970 --> 02:11:55,920
You know,
you've got a guy who's been active,

2486
02:11:56,300 --> 02:11:57,133
a guy who's been fighting,
a guy who's angry guy who felt he beat 

2487
02:12:00,331 --> 02:12:03,540
John Jones the first time against a 
very,

2488
02:12:03,541 --> 02:12:06,180
very talented,
dangerous arrested.

2489
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:09,930
John jones is their ring dust.
You know,

2490
02:12:10,190 --> 02:12:11,570
their ring rust.
I'm sorry,

2491
02:12:12,420 --> 02:12:16,370
what the fuck am I talking about?
You're the look at the man.

2492
02:12:16,460 --> 02:12:21,460
The cris cyborg has been bitch slapped 
and motherfuckers since day one.

2493
02:12:22,290 --> 02:12:23,123
Amanda nunez is something that you 
taught me about that's not around 

2494
02:12:26,461 --> 02:12:28,680
anymore.
And that's being slick.

2495
02:12:29,220 --> 02:12:32,970
Amanda nunez is very slick.
She's taken out some tough opponents.

2496
02:12:33,450 --> 02:12:34,860
You know,
she hits very hard,

2497
02:12:35,170 --> 02:12:39,200
very long arms.
Really watch over us in carlos kind with

2498
02:12:39,210 --> 02:12:40,043
Michael Chase.
This is a great fucking fight right 

2499
02:12:42,661 --> 02:12:44,100
here.
You know,

2500
02:12:44,330 --> 02:12:45,163
America does.
Alexander vulcan fuckIng tremendous 

2501
02:12:49,940 --> 02:12:50,773
fight to Chad mendez.
Amazing in his comeback fight when you 

2502
02:12:52,891 --> 02:12:54,720
grow up with.
Scroll back up to the cris cyborg.

2503
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:55,933
I read chris corie.
Anderson's a leather is real heartbreak 

2504
02:12:59,911 --> 02:13:02,340
and his wife,
seven months pregnant now.

2505
02:13:02,370 --> 02:13:03,650
They got to get away.
You know,

2506
02:13:03,660 --> 02:13:06,480
this has to be.
It's a disaster,

2507
02:13:06,481 --> 02:13:11,481
but this honestly guys was one of those 
cards that I look at and go,

2508
02:13:12,091 --> 02:13:14,220
okay,
what are the main two fights?

2509
02:13:14,610 --> 02:13:17,220
I know favorite paper.

2510
02:13:17,220 --> 02:13:19,380
You got to go outside.
Borgen jon jones.

2511
02:13:19,770 --> 02:13:20,603
But guess what?
People you've never seen a buggy with a 

2512
02:13:22,711 --> 02:13:25,500
part time job,
so somebody has got to lose one of these

2513
02:13:25,501 --> 02:13:26,520
fights.
Keeps growing.

2514
02:13:26,521 --> 02:13:30,600
If you don't mind seeing thing about 
chris cyborg is she's not just good.

2515
02:13:30,630 --> 02:13:34,680
She's good.
And ball and gannon on Megan Anderson.

2516
02:13:35,190 --> 02:13:38,520
Andrea alaska's fighting on this card.
She's australian.

2517
02:13:38,521 --> 02:13:40,220
You got to say meagan,
meagan,

2518
02:13:40,310 --> 02:13:43,170
whatever dog.
I'm no fucking english major.

2519
02:13:43,560 --> 02:13:46,250
And you got bj penn,
ryan fucking hall.

2520
02:13:46,260 --> 02:13:50,370
I think that's the first fight of the 
first fight of the crazy.

2521
02:13:50,730 --> 02:13:51,563
Yeah.
I saw a picture on instagram the other 

2522
02:13:56,851 --> 02:13:58,050
day.
She looks phenomenal.

2523
02:13:58,830 --> 02:13:59,663
She looks fucking phenomenal brown,
so it's a shame that this had to be 

2524
02:14:03,481 --> 02:14:05,220
done.
I'm sorry,

2525
02:14:05,221 --> 02:14:06,054
I'm,
I'm,

2526
02:14:06,120 --> 02:14:07,740
I'm happy that the fight are taking 
place.

2527
02:14:07,880 --> 02:14:11,850
I'm just happy that they're taking place
or that everybody gets to life disrupted

2528
02:14:11,851 --> 02:14:14,850
and the families have to go from vegas 
to la to see the fight.

2529
02:14:14,850 --> 02:14:17,310
I'm sorry about all the hotel bullshit 
that they have to deal with,

2530
02:14:17,850 --> 02:14:18,683
but uh,
I'm very happy that the fight is still 

2531
02:14:20,371 --> 02:14:21,204
taking place.
I would love it if uber ran the fucking 

2532
02:14:23,701 --> 02:14:27,250
special for people just to flat.
Yeah.

2533
02:14:27,330 --> 02:14:29,910
Just run a flat for fucking people out 
of vegas.

2534
02:14:30,390 --> 02:14:32,070
300.
Never gonna happen,

2535
02:14:32,100 --> 02:14:34,410
but you never know.
You never know.

2536
02:14:34,890 --> 02:14:36,780
You never know.
People need fucking action.

2537
02:14:36,810 --> 02:14:39,090
Come on,
let's go step up.

2538
02:14:39,091 --> 02:14:39,924
Bitch.
Make a flat rate for three fucking 

2539
02:14:41,700 --> 02:14:45,180
people fucking forum and $300 back.
People would do it.

2540
02:14:45,420 --> 02:14:46,253
What's driving in uber?
Some guy farting in the car all the way 

2541
02:14:48,421 --> 02:14:49,254
from vegas to la.
Why would you do that when you take a 

2542
02:14:51,361 --> 02:14:53,280
flight?
Because the flight is going to be.

2543
02:14:53,360 --> 02:14:56,910
It's not that expensive.
Uber's is on a day's notice.

2544
02:14:57,060 --> 02:14:58,950
Is it?
How much the southwest cost?

2545
02:14:58,980 --> 02:15:01,720
It's 2:55.
Here's $300.

2546
02:15:01,770 --> 02:15:04,830
300 teachers in a car with a guy 
fighting for three hours for three.

2547
02:15:04,840 --> 02:15:08,690
300 divided by three.
I save 200 something joe.

2548
02:15:08,710 --> 02:15:09,543
Right.
you have to look at them from their 

2549
02:15:10,291 --> 02:15:11,910
perspective.
You know,

2550
02:15:11,911 --> 02:15:16,500
they've already fucking taken away and 
they lose a day of work.

2551
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:17,713
This is a lot.
Well also they can't gamble like a lot 

2552
02:15:19,681 --> 02:15:23,760
of people love the combination of 
gambling and going to go into the show.

2553
02:15:24,340 --> 02:15:25,740
a lot of people stuck.
A lot of people.

2554
02:15:25,741 --> 02:15:27,780
Gonna fuck it.
I'll just take my money from the ticket.

2555
02:15:27,890 --> 02:15:30,870
Yup.
And stay and gamble next day or whatever

2556
02:15:30,871 --> 02:15:33,680
because what's it going to cost me to 
uber,

2557
02:15:33,720 --> 02:15:36,830
to la?
Get out party who?

2558
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:40,650
You're going to come to a lady just 
getting the car if you're trying to tell

2559
02:15:40,651 --> 02:15:41,161
me.
No,

2560
02:15:41,161 --> 02:15:43,660
you Want to go to a party?
Who?

2561
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:44,760

2562
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:46,193

John jones might be having a party call 

2563
02:15:48,460 --> 02:15:50,790
was kind of doing my babbling an after 
party.

2564
02:15:51,060 --> 02:15:52,560
Uriah hall.
I think you're right.

2565
02:15:52,561 --> 02:15:56,060
I was on this card to his.
He wasn't in the new year.

2566
02:15:56,070 --> 02:15:57,990
Uriah hall's on this card,
I think.

2567
02:15:58,820 --> 02:15:59,950
Yeah,

2568
02:16:00,150 --> 02:16:01,260

2569
02:16:01,261 --> 02:16:02,460

Bj penn.

2570
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:05,370
Oh wow.
Okay.

2571
02:16:05,371 --> 02:16:06,390
We didn't see it.
Look at this part.

2572
02:16:06,630 --> 02:16:07,463
You got to know who's having Brian Kelly
as fighting curtis mill under that is a 

2573
02:16:12,121 --> 02:16:13,910
fucking sleeper fight right there.
Yeah.

2574
02:16:13,940 --> 02:16:15,650
No,
he's a fucking beast.

2575
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:18,540
Curtis.
Mel under that guy is.

2576
02:16:18,780 --> 02:16:23,070
He's got serious potential.
He's got like superstar future superstar

2577
02:16:23,071 --> 02:16:26,430
potential and he's very good.
That's a good fight.

2578
02:16:27,810 --> 02:16:30,100
I liked that a lot.
In curtis mill under

2579
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:33,940
is the one he fought.
Tiago alvarez and stopped them.

2580
02:16:33,970 --> 02:16:35,550
Right.
Click on that.

2581
02:16:35,590 --> 02:16:39,920
Make sure that's correct.
Does it show his record?

2582
02:16:41,550 --> 02:16:42,410
Show his record.

2583
02:16:43,830 --> 02:16:46,080
How good is there a website now?
It's pretty good.

2584
02:16:46,470 --> 02:16:47,370
Yeah,
that's it.

2585
02:16:47,460 --> 02:16:48,900
Tiago alvarez.
he beat thiago.

2586
02:16:48,901 --> 02:16:50,490
Alves.
YeAh.

2587
02:16:51,780 --> 02:16:53,670
And then he beat max griffin.
He's a beast man.

2588
02:16:53,700 --> 02:16:55,410
He's a very good,
real,

2589
02:16:55,411 --> 02:17:00,390
a real massive future potential.
And by her design it knocks people dead.

2590
02:17:00,660 --> 02:17:02,340
He hits hard.
That's a sleeper fight.

2591
02:17:02,341 --> 02:17:03,660
That's a fight that no one's talking 
about.

2592
02:17:03,870 --> 02:17:04,890
Very,
very good fight.

2593
02:17:05,520 --> 02:17:06,870
It's going to be a great card,
man.

2594
02:17:06,871 --> 02:17:10,050
I'm happy to cards happening.
I hope everybody gets compensated.

2595
02:17:10,051 --> 02:17:10,884
I'm sorry that the ufc loses money.
I'm sorry that everybody gets dragged 

2596
02:17:13,111 --> 02:17:13,944
through.
I don't understand why they couldn't 

2597
02:17:14,311 --> 02:17:19,311
just figure out this in Nevada.
It's like I guess they're on vacation or

2598
02:17:19,351 --> 02:17:21,030
some shit.
That's so crazy.

2599
02:17:21,031 --> 02:17:24,590
Like figuring out how everybody.
Let's make a phone call like it.

2600
02:17:24,610 --> 02:17:26,850
Isn't there one person who could like 
some person should say.

2601
02:17:26,851 --> 02:17:28,950
Okay.
Is it to the best of your knowledge?

2602
02:17:29,130 --> 02:17:30,700
Absolutely.
From the original task.

2603
02:17:30,720 --> 02:17:32,520
Yes sir.
By all the science,

2604
02:17:32,640 --> 02:17:35,190
we're going to submit the science and 
we'll show you the science.

2605
02:17:35,240 --> 02:17:37,410
We dIdn't tell you the number.
Okay.

2606
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:40,520
Let them fight.
Let them fight.

2607
02:17:40,980 --> 02:17:43,800
If you have let him fight California,
let him fucking fight in Nevada.

2608
02:17:44,430 --> 02:17:46,260
Stupid.
How fucking stupid.

2609
02:17:46,990 --> 02:17:50,670
It's just stupid that in this case it's 
this case.

2610
02:17:50,671 --> 02:17:52,940
It's approximate their own vacation.
Well,

2611
02:17:52,941 --> 02:17:57,090
that's a with emergency meeting.
Let's save vegas.

2612
02:17:57,680 --> 02:18:00,510
The tourism board of vegas must be 
steaming.

2613
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:01,380
hey,
ask this.

2614
02:18:01,410 --> 02:18:02,370
Ask this,
google this.

2615
02:18:02,940 --> 02:18:03,773
Find out who's disputing.
If anybody dispute if anybody makes any 

2616
02:18:07,351 --> 02:18:09,510
sense.
if there's a scientist or something like

2617
02:18:09,511 --> 02:18:13,430
that who says that it could be 
microdosing or that it did.

2618
02:18:13,740 --> 02:18:14,573
What the California state athletic 
commissions understanding of it is not 

2619
02:18:18,121 --> 02:18:18,954
correct.
Let's find out if there's anYbody that 

2620
02:18:21,030 --> 02:18:24,270
has written anything about that.
I'm upset.

2621
02:18:24,330 --> 02:18:27,900
I just wanted this fight to take place 
without any bullshit behind it.

2622
02:18:27,930 --> 02:18:29,910
I just want it to be a great fight.
It's a.

2623
02:18:30,120 --> 02:18:30,953
It's an amazing matchup.
I think gustafson especially against 

2624
02:18:33,841 --> 02:18:35,370
glover,
to share has never looked better.

2625
02:18:35,400 --> 02:18:37,560
He's.
He's long as john.

2626
02:18:37,561 --> 02:18:38,394
He's got crazy footwork.
He's the first guy to ever take jon 

2627
02:18:41,491 --> 02:18:42,324
down.
It was a fucking tough fight regardless 

2628
02:18:44,671 --> 02:18:46,360
of whether or not john prepared much for
it.

2629
02:18:46,390 --> 02:18:50,490
I don't think he did prepare as good as 
you could have a gustafson's better,

2630
02:18:50,491 --> 02:18:52,590
I think than he was when that fight took
place.

2631
02:18:52,591 --> 02:18:56,310
I really do think he's better.
It's a fucking phenomenal.

2632
02:18:56,370 --> 02:18:57,203
it's an amazing fight and john's going 
to be so motivated to try to get 

2633
02:19:01,110 --> 02:19:02,340
stripped away.
He gets tripped.

2634
02:19:02,341 --> 02:19:03,174
All the different things that he's 
fucked up to have a chance of 

2635
02:19:05,341 --> 02:19:07,110
redemption.
It's going to be so motivated,

2636
02:19:07,320 --> 02:19:10,020
but you also have to consider the 
incredible amount of pressure.

2637
02:19:10,021 --> 02:19:11,010
He's going to be under two.

2638
02:19:11,790 --> 02:19:14,340
Historically though,
he's a guy who shines under pressure,

2639
02:19:14,380 --> 02:19:17,490
I mean stop shogun and it's first title 
fight when he was,

2640
02:19:17,491 --> 02:19:19,050
what was he?
Twenty two or something like thAt.

2641
02:19:19,360 --> 02:19:20,193
He's a monster.
John's always been good at fighting top 

2642
02:19:23,641 --> 02:19:25,800
level competition.
good at handling the stress,

2643
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:28,670
but this is you.
It's a different kind of stress.

2644
02:19:28,671 --> 02:19:30,080
This is.
I fucked up stress.

2645
02:19:30,230 --> 02:19:32,000
It's not.
This is a big fight.

2646
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:33,193
This is a big fight.
Plus I fucked up and everybody knows I 

2647
02:19:35,511 --> 02:19:38,780
fucked up and this is not even the 
current fuck up.

2648
02:19:38,781 --> 02:19:42,080
It's reminding him over the past fuck up
and then there's the other stuff,

2649
02:19:42,110 --> 02:19:44,840
the car accident and all the other crazy
shit.

2650
02:19:45,560 --> 02:19:49,430
All of it's bad,
but He has an opportunity at redemption.

2651
02:19:49,820 --> 02:19:53,720
It's just when you know how much is on 
the line because he's undefeated,

2652
02:19:53,721 --> 02:19:55,730
right?
Except for matt hamill fight,

2653
02:19:55,731 --> 02:19:59,650
which we know he was destroying hamill 
and he was disqualified.

2654
02:19:59,690 --> 02:20:01,670
Wasn't a real loss like somebody beat 
him.

2655
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:05,760
He's beaten everybody that's 
unprecedented outside of khabib number.

2656
02:20:05,761 --> 02:20:07,370
go ahead off.
Nobody beats everybody.

2657
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:08,353
John's beaten everybody.
So there's going to be a certain amount 

2658
02:20:09,951 --> 02:20:13,490
of people that are looking forWard for 
him to fail and he feels that too.

2659
02:20:14,060 --> 02:20:15,260
So a lot going on,
man.

2660
02:20:15,261 --> 02:20:18,890
It's a lot going on in this fight.
And gustafson is fucking good.

2661
02:20:19,460 --> 02:20:21,920
You received a combination.
He knocked out clover to cheryl with.

2662
02:20:22,270 --> 02:20:24,620
Ooh,
that's like some video game shit man.

2663
02:20:25,430 --> 02:20:28,280
It was like he was in mortal kombat was 
tremendous.

2664
02:20:28,400 --> 02:20:29,233
His footwork,

2665
02:20:29,340 --> 02:20:30,600
everything.
I was really.

2666
02:20:30,660 --> 02:20:33,050
I got to work saturday night.
I'm work.

2667
02:20:33,550 --> 02:20:34,940
I'm alex.
Not all weekend.

2668
02:20:34,970 --> 02:20:36,990
Oh,
you really forgot.

2669
02:20:36,991 --> 02:20:38,590
I thought it was just last week.
Um,

2670
02:20:39,050 --> 02:20:42,990
so I thought it was this last weekend.
So I called the store.

2671
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:46,740
I called in and then I go,
fuck no,

2672
02:20:46,741 --> 02:20:50,400
I'm not missing that.
I called back and canceled and then like

2673
02:20:50,401 --> 02:20:52,120
wednesday I go,
what the fuck am I thinking?

2674
02:20:52,140 --> 02:20:54,300
So I ended up back at the store saturday
night.

2675
02:20:54,800 --> 02:20:58,860
I squeezed onto brian show.
I got to see tiffany haddish.

2676
02:20:58,861 --> 02:21:02,520
I hadn't seen her since she busted out,
became a star.

2677
02:21:02,940 --> 02:21:05,360
It was great just to see her and 
bullshit with her.

2678
02:21:06,030 --> 02:21:08,660
And then last night I went down and 
there was two shows and it was,

2679
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:09,690
I'm leaving.
They're like,

2680
02:21:09,691 --> 02:21:11,940
hey,
you want to open up for chappelle?

2681
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:12,833
I go,
chappelle,

2682
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:16,110
when he knows he's doing the show on the
belly room,

2683
02:21:16,530 --> 02:21:17,363
there was a fucking line around the 
corner on the sunday that I pulled that 

2684
02:21:21,451 --> 02:21:21,961
out.
I was like,

2685
02:21:21,961 --> 02:21:25,960
this is crazy.
This is so fucking insane.

2686
02:21:25,961 --> 02:21:29,380
That took two weeks off from getting 
onstage.

2687
02:21:29,810 --> 02:21:30,643
I have To la jolla.
I did two nights and law and that was 

2688
02:21:33,601 --> 02:21:35,730
tremendous to joe.
Rogan is amazing.

2689
02:21:35,731 --> 02:21:39,420
You don't owe is the room you go into 
when you want to put.

2690
02:21:39,570 --> 02:21:43,590
You want to thread that out again?
They take the ride with you.

2691
02:21:44,220 --> 02:21:46,770
That's one of the few rooms.
This takes the right way.

2692
02:21:46,870 --> 02:21:48,210
You do two shows a night down there.

2693
02:21:50,790 --> 02:21:54,030
That place is amazing.
It's like a comedy store south.

2694
02:21:54,120 --> 02:21:55,110
Yeah.
Really?

2695
02:21:55,111 --> 02:21:59,370
It's a little bit more loose.
Even though it's friday to saturday.

2696
02:21:59,371 --> 02:22:01,940
We'll let you try some new shit.
Fun people down there,

2697
02:22:01,941 --> 02:22:02,880
man.
very fun.

2698
02:22:03,060 --> 02:22:03,893
That's a nice area.
Like diego has a lot of the same 

2699
02:22:06,271 --> 02:22:09,780
qualitieS that la has,
but it's more like a little bit more.

2700
02:22:09,790 --> 02:22:10,970
The rest of the country

2701
02:22:12,110 --> 02:22:15,570
is beautiful.
Even went to rada jujitsu.

2702
02:22:15,571 --> 02:22:20,390
I train when they that the place is 
right next to the fucking calm.

2703
02:22:20,430 --> 02:22:21,750
they store.
Really?

2704
02:22:21,930 --> 02:22:23,770
Yeah.
I just looked it up.

2705
02:22:24,600 --> 02:22:29,600
Called guy was 11 either.
La jolla is.

2706
02:22:31,860 --> 02:22:34,600
That's where you moved to when you got a
lot of gators.

2707
02:22:36,360 --> 02:22:39,780
That's a lot down there.
He lives on that corner.

2708
02:22:39,781 --> 02:22:44,781
Natto island does donald rumsfeld.
I don'T know who lives out of rescues,

2709
02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:46,193
but it is just gorgeous.
You can see at night there's no lights 

2710
02:22:50,130 --> 02:22:51,630
on the streets.
There's nothing.

2711
02:22:52,020 --> 02:22:54,260
They ain't carriage that listening.
Nine Thirty.

2712
02:22:54,300 --> 02:22:55,890
Go to bed,
go to bed,

2713
02:22:57,360 --> 02:22:58,340
go to bed now.
Right?

2714
02:22:58,410 --> 02:23:01,320
We don't want you all to mingle.
Go fucking down the side.

2715
02:23:01,330 --> 02:23:02,163
Whatever.
The street.

2716
02:23:03,030 --> 02:23:05,370
Scotty short lived down there.
He showed up.

2717
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:09,410
He showed up on saturday.
be a hug.

2718
02:23:10,320 --> 02:23:12,750
It was great to see him.
He has a little dog with him.

2719
02:23:12,930 --> 02:23:15,900
He had the little dog because I do a 
joke,

2720
02:23:15,901 --> 02:23:17,860
but I had to get his dick suck with a 
dog,

2721
02:23:18,510 --> 02:23:22,410
so he goes to the inspire dog and go,
no,

2722
02:23:22,411 --> 02:23:23,244
I didn't see the dog.
He came down to see lou still playing 

2723
02:23:27,151 --> 02:23:27,984
the piano.
I mean the comedy store down there did 

2724
02:23:30,840 --> 02:23:31,673
not lose anything except mitzi shore.
Plus It's got more shit on the walls 

2725
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:38,513
that you look at.
It really makes you think there's 

2726
02:23:41,311 --> 02:23:42,144
pictures of green rooms and jim carrey 
and Paul Rodriguez and dice clay and 

2727
02:23:46,381 --> 02:23:47,214
louis and this time,
but they didn't even know that we're 

2728
02:23:48,900 --> 02:23:52,590
going to be stars.
We'd done down there.

2729
02:23:53,310 --> 02:23:55,150
Can we tell a lot of shows?
It shows.

2730
02:23:56,070 --> 02:23:57,510
When did we first started working 
together?

2731
02:23:57,511 --> 02:23:58,344
Down there?

2732
02:24:00,060 --> 02:24:02,280
I think the first time.
Yeah.

2733
02:24:02,700 --> 02:24:05,320
I was like the late 90.
The first time I went down there,

2734
02:24:05,321 --> 02:24:08,040
went down there with a girl.
Who was it?

2735
02:24:08,790 --> 02:24:09,623
I don't remember what her name was.
It was a very uncomfortable weekend 

2736
02:24:12,510 --> 02:24:13,343
because she was clean.
All you have to stay in the condo with 

2737
02:24:15,511 --> 02:24:16,290
her.
Yeah.

2738
02:24:16,290 --> 02:24:17,110
Oh,
that's crazy.

2739
02:24:17,110 --> 02:24:19,260
Already.
Dirty girl and being forced to stay in a

2740
02:24:19,261 --> 02:24:20,720
condo with a guy that you don't even 
know.

2741
02:24:20,910 --> 02:24:21,743
She stayed in the headline of room.
I stayed in the feature room at that 

2742
02:24:24,631 --> 02:24:26,520
time still.
It's weird.

2743
02:24:26,550 --> 02:24:29,320
Then I went down there.
She wouldn't book me down there.

2744
02:24:30,070 --> 02:24:32,390
Once you started booking me,
she booked me lot.

2745
02:24:32,430 --> 02:24:33,540
Mitzi?
Yeah,

2746
02:24:33,541 --> 02:24:34,374
and I remember going down there one time
and I went down there with martinez and 

2747
02:24:39,320 --> 02:24:40,153
her husband and we weren't there and an 
hour and Maryland martina's husband 

2748
02:24:44,941 --> 02:24:46,440
comes out with a fucking rat.

2749
02:24:47,450 --> 02:24:48,283
Well,
with a rat trap trap that he said he 

2750
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:56,460
weren't here motherfucking because the 
rumor was there were rats down there.

2751
02:24:56,970 --> 02:24:58,300
Be careful.
Oh.

2752
02:24:58,590 --> 02:25:01,850
so he went down and set traps up within 
our unit.

2753
02:25:01,890 --> 02:25:03,320
Bob.
Oh my god.

2754
02:25:03,360 --> 02:25:05,970
The fucking thing had to be nine inches 
long.

2755
02:25:05,971 --> 02:25:06,804
The tail.
And I'll never forget going on the 

2756
02:25:08,761 --> 02:25:10,710
balcony and then hearing them in the 
weeds.

2757
02:25:11,100 --> 02:25:15,720
I packed up my little sleep apnea 
machine and I fucking drove back home.

2758
02:25:15,721 --> 02:25:18,050
I fucking hate rats.
I fucking hatE it.

2759
02:25:18,390 --> 02:25:19,223
Well,
the store has so many rats that back 

2760
02:25:20,941 --> 02:25:22,050
area.
Oh my god.

2761
02:25:22,051 --> 02:25:24,070
Oh my god.
They're fucking popping out every

2762
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:25,940
time you sit in the back there.
There's a little,

2763
02:25:25,941 --> 02:25:27,530
uh,
for folks that are listening to this,

2764
02:25:27,560 --> 02:25:29,770
there's a little back bar area.
We're only comics in.

2765
02:25:29,771 --> 02:25:32,030
Their friends can go behind the back 
bars,

2766
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:35,260
a smoking area,
and that smoking area has these railroad

2767
02:25:35,261 --> 02:25:36,094
ties and these railroad ties.
These rats will run in and out of these 

2768
02:25:38,441 --> 02:25:43,060
ties and over the top all the time.
All the time.

2769
02:25:43,270 --> 02:25:46,180
If I'm back there for more than 15 
minutes,

2770
02:25:46,181 --> 02:25:51,181
I'm seeing a rat and if you go near the 
hedges by the dumpster,

2771
02:25:51,340 --> 02:25:53,290
that's where they really are.
Where we're.

2772
02:25:53,770 --> 02:25:56,050
The back area is not that big.
It's the hills.

2773
02:25:56,200 --> 02:25:59,710
The hills are filled with rats.
The hollywood hills are filled with rats

2774
02:25:59,980 --> 02:26:00,813
and occasionally we have cats that hang 
around the parking lot of the comedy 

2775
02:26:03,521 --> 02:26:05,830
store,
like local feral cats,

2776
02:26:06,100 --> 02:26:08,950
but they don't get the rats because the 
rats go in the fucking.

2777
02:26:09,010 --> 02:26:12,850
The vines,
thOse vines that covered the side of the

2778
02:26:12,851 --> 02:26:13,684
comedy store ramp,
the ramp that leads up to the 

2779
02:26:15,121 --> 02:26:17,950
[inaudible] hotel.
Those vines are all rats.

2780
02:26:18,340 --> 02:26:22,720
That's a rat village.
It's crazy how much sound they make when

2781
02:26:22,721 --> 02:26:25,840
you're parking the car.
You hear them scurrying.

2782
02:26:26,760 --> 02:26:28,750
There's probably hundreds of rats there.

2783
02:26:29,350 --> 02:26:33,270
Dude.
I parked my car but I'd dump site closed

2784
02:26:33,271 --> 02:26:34,840
the windows.
Oh,

2785
02:26:35,740 --> 02:26:39,760
because I know I don't want to jump into
a car with a fucking listen to me.

2786
02:26:40,380 --> 02:26:45,380
I just leave fucking.
I leave a aspen.

2787
02:26:45,850 --> 02:26:49,600
I owe like $80,000.
I got eight people looking for me to cop

2788
02:26:49,601 --> 02:26:52,990
some looking for me.
I go from aspen to boulder.

2789
02:26:53,500 --> 02:26:56,140
I needed a job so I take a job making 
joe,

2790
02:26:56,141 --> 02:26:59,170
I'm not kidding you.
One 60 a week,

2791
02:26:59,410 --> 02:27:00,243
60 hours as a fucking shag,
which I'm the guy that takes a car from 

2792
02:27:05,561 --> 02:27:06,394
you in the body shop when you pull up,
takes it and I wash it and then they 

2793
02:27:11,670 --> 02:27:14,980
struck the body work and then after 
they'd done the bodywork,

2794
02:27:15,510 --> 02:27:18,940
I'm the guy that washes and it'd be do 
that for three or four months.

2795
02:27:19,480 --> 02:27:24,480
Then they turn you into a detail and I 
passed the test and every game of detail

2796
02:27:24,651 --> 02:27:25,990
and $160 a week.

2797
02:27:26,330 --> 02:27:28,360
It was fucking garbage.
I was starving,

2798
02:27:29,230 --> 02:27:33,250
starving,
but I was good and I became a detail.

2799
02:27:33,680 --> 02:27:34,513
The detail room was commissioned and you
made 100 to a buck 50 a day and you 

2800
02:27:39,111 --> 02:27:40,390
know,
I was enjoying it,

2801
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:46,200
but the guy I had as a boss was.
His name is derrick Jordan.

2802
02:27:46,631 --> 02:27:50,740
He was just a day though.
He was one of those guys that was one of

2803
02:27:50,741 --> 02:27:52,660
us,
but when they get a manager's job,

2804
02:27:53,330 --> 02:27:58,330
one that I'm back there washing the 
fucking car and I see a dead rat.

2805
02:27:59,380 --> 02:28:04,360
I picked the fucking rat up and he had 
his jacket hanging by the door.

2806
02:28:04,900 --> 02:28:08,050
I put the dead rat in his pocket of his 
jacket.

2807
02:28:08,910 --> 02:28:11,500
Know though I go home,
I get stolen.

2808
02:28:11,501 --> 02:28:16,501
I don't know that the next morning he 
comes in row and it's fucked up.

2809
02:28:18,310 --> 02:28:19,720
Like he hit like a pole.

2810
02:28:24,530 --> 02:28:25,363
He went in his pocket to get a cigarette
and he pulled the fucking ride out and 

2811
02:28:29,350 --> 02:28:33,500
he fucking just went crazy.
They're like a ball and running.

2812
02:28:33,501 --> 02:28:36,860
I know who did this.
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.

2813
02:28:36,861 --> 02:28:41,861
And he kept blaming some other guy.
My boss's.

2814
02:28:46,760 --> 02:28:47,593
Fuck man.
That's one of the worst relationships 

2815
02:28:48,861 --> 02:28:50,420
ever,
but boston employee,

2816
02:28:51,050 --> 02:28:54,260
one of the worst relationships some guy 
gets to tell you what to do.

2817
02:28:54,680 --> 02:28:56,930
He's the fucking.
He's the head guy at the office.

2818
02:28:56,990 --> 02:28:57,823
You gotta listen to this.
Fuck head is one of the worst positions 

2819
02:29:00,921 --> 02:29:05,810
to be in working for a guy who's a dick 
and that power that someone would have,

2820
02:29:05,870 --> 02:29:06,703
you know,
if you were,

2821
02:29:06,920 --> 02:29:09,710
you moved on up,
became the office manager.

2822
02:29:10,100 --> 02:29:14,120
He can control people's future control 
where they get a raise,

2823
02:29:14,390 --> 02:29:15,223
how much time they get off.
You can make the decisions whether or 

2824
02:29:17,870 --> 02:29:19,550
not you allow them to do certain things.

2825
02:29:20,310 --> 02:29:24,080
Fucking bullshit.
Come on,

2826
02:29:24,081 --> 02:29:29,081
be clean.
But what was the first guy you looked at

2827
02:29:29,331 --> 02:29:30,600
and said,
you don't want.

2828
02:29:31,500 --> 02:29:34,210
If I ever see outside of the ama,
fuck you up.

2829
02:29:34,400 --> 02:29:36,200
I never said that,
but uh,

2830
02:29:36,500 --> 02:29:38,540
guys in construction,
they would get real dickie.

2831
02:29:38,541 --> 02:29:39,374
I did one time,
there was a guy when I was a teenager 

2832
02:29:41,091 --> 02:29:43,040
that was talking to a bunch of shit.
He would hit me with a hammer.

2833
02:29:44,360 --> 02:29:46,640
Yeah,
there was a [inaudible] he got.

2834
02:29:46,670 --> 02:29:51,170
He got aggressive with me and it,
it wasn't in a way where,

2835
02:29:51,171 --> 02:29:52,460
um,
I deserved it.

2836
02:29:52,580 --> 02:29:54,800
He was just bullying me and I was like 
16,

2837
02:29:54,801 --> 02:29:55,634
17,
but I had already had a fuck load of 

2838
02:29:57,741 --> 02:29:59,210
fights by then,
like,

2839
02:29:59,410 --> 02:30:00,740
you know,
talk about no fights.

2840
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:01,410
I was like,
did I,

2841
02:30:01,410 --> 02:30:03,470
oh,
kick you in your fucking head.

2842
02:30:03,710 --> 02:30:05,840
Like you talk a bunch of crazy shit to 
me like this.

2843
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:08,420
Like he was talking to me in a,
not just a way,

2844
02:30:08,421 --> 02:30:09,254
like a boss employee.
He was talking to me in a way where I 

2845
02:30:12,261 --> 02:30:14,990
was going to have to quit,
but I never,

2846
02:30:15,230 --> 02:30:16,063
never,
never said I was gonna do anything to 

2847
02:30:17,181 --> 02:30:19,700
him.
I didn't threaten him and say,

2848
02:30:19,701 --> 02:30:21,380
I'll see you after this and I'll fuck 
you up.

2849
02:30:22,010 --> 02:30:22,843
I said,
don't talk to me like that because I 

2850
02:30:23,631 --> 02:30:25,550
could fuck you up.
That's basically what I said.

2851
02:30:27,140 --> 02:30:29,390
But that's the thing about construction 
is like,

2852
02:30:29,391 --> 02:30:32,530
there was a lot of like man demand type 
conflict.

2853
02:30:32,531 --> 02:30:33,364
Like it wasn't unheard of to hear about 
street fights between guys who are 

2854
02:30:35,721 --> 02:30:36,554
working together.
They got pissed and pushed each other 

2855
02:30:37,821 --> 02:30:39,920
and punch each other in the fucking 
snow.

2856
02:30:40,030 --> 02:30:43,010
You know,
dudes carrying roofing tiles.

2857
02:30:43,250 --> 02:30:45,110
One guy knocks another guy over or 
something.

2858
02:30:45,150 --> 02:30:47,240
They start fighting.
That shit happened all the time.

2859
02:30:47,660 --> 02:30:50,120
There's a lot of the people that were 
doing labor too.

2860
02:30:50,150 --> 02:30:50,983
We're like real dirt bags.
Like there was this one guy that I did 

2861
02:30:53,541 --> 02:30:54,374
labor with.
I worked with my friend leroy rodriguez 

2862
02:30:56,331 --> 02:30:58,610
and his buddy.
They have some business partner.

2863
02:30:58,611 --> 02:31:00,800
They would take apart old houses and 
redo them.

2864
02:31:00,801 --> 02:31:04,790
And leroy was one of the black belts at 
the taekwondo institute.

2865
02:31:04,990 --> 02:31:08,960
He was a bad motherfucker and uh,
leroy got me this gig and uh,

2866
02:31:08,990 --> 02:31:09,823
I've worked with these guys labor and in
one of the guys we work with lived in 

2867
02:31:12,441 --> 02:31:13,274
this fucked up,
abandoned building and what not 

2868
02:31:14,811 --> 02:31:16,760
abandoned but stripped out building.
I mean,

2869
02:31:16,761 --> 02:31:19,650
there was parts of the building when 
there's no floor was all fucked up.

2870
02:31:19,651 --> 02:31:20,010
Half the

2871
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:22,170
walls were missing.
They were redoing the whole building and

2872
02:31:22,190 --> 02:31:23,023
taking things out and fixing things.
This guy lived there and he had a 

2873
02:31:24,841 --> 02:31:25,674
mountain dew jug filled with malt liquor
and he would drink it warm all day and 

2874
02:31:31,051 --> 02:31:33,720
he had the shakes.
Everything he did to do have the shakes.

2875
02:31:33,721 --> 02:31:37,850
He was just drunk all day on a crazy job
site where like,

2876
02:31:37,860 --> 02:31:40,950
you know,
there's no floors sometimes everything's

2877
02:31:40,951 --> 02:31:41,784
all fucked up.
You have to balance when you're going 

2878
02:31:42,751 --> 02:31:43,584
from one room to the other because 
they're tearing down parts of the wall 

2879
02:31:45,511 --> 02:31:46,344
and this guy somehow or another fucking 
slid on through drinking the entire 

2880
02:31:50,041 --> 02:31:52,470
time.
And I remember thinking like,

2881
02:31:52,471 --> 02:31:54,840
these are people that have made 
questionable decisions.

2882
02:31:54,841 --> 02:31:55,674
It makes you want to go back to college,
makes you want to get a degree when 

2883
02:31:58,171 --> 02:31:59,004
you're around.
A lot of these guys like laborers and 

2884
02:31:59,971 --> 02:32:01,330
stuff like,
you know,

2885
02:32:01,410 --> 02:32:02,490
some of them are just like me.

2886
02:32:02,520 --> 02:32:05,940
They're just young guys who need a gig 
and they need money and some of them are

2887
02:32:05,941 --> 02:32:06,774
dudes have been doing it their whole 
life and they're 50 and they're drunk 

2888
02:32:09,530 --> 02:32:14,530
and terrible by yourself.
If I want to do this,

2889
02:32:15,090 --> 02:32:16,320
I definitely knew I didn't want to do 
it.

2890
02:32:16,830 --> 02:32:18,050
I definitely knew I didn't want to do 
it.

2891
02:32:18,080 --> 02:32:20,700
That will be a carpenter is a different 
gig,

2892
02:32:21,030 --> 02:32:21,863
you know,
like a real good carpenter that's a 

2893
02:32:23,311 --> 02:32:25,260
skilled craftsman and an artist,
you know,

2894
02:32:25,261 --> 02:32:27,660
you're putting together things that's 
different,

2895
02:32:27,661 --> 02:32:30,810
but the labor gig was not like you 
didn't really have to know anything.

2896
02:32:31,080 --> 02:32:33,060
You just had to be big enough to listen 
to them,

2897
02:32:33,260 --> 02:32:35,010
you know,
picking up to like pick things up.

2898
02:32:35,011 --> 02:32:36,780
Can you go get that?
GO get me that bag of cement.

2899
02:32:37,080 --> 02:32:37,950
Go dee dee.
All right,

2900
02:32:37,951 --> 02:32:39,780
you guys are going to take nails out of 
these boards now.

2901
02:32:39,781 --> 02:32:40,614
And iT was like that kind of shit.
You just hung out with the weirdest 

2902
02:32:42,811 --> 02:32:43,644
people meant

2903
02:32:44,510 --> 02:32:46,550
the worst guy.
I remember joe rogan.

2904
02:32:46,551 --> 02:32:50,780
I was cleaned from coke.
I was clean about 90 days.

2905
02:32:50,781 --> 02:32:51,614
I was really trying to turn my life 
around and I answered an ad 

2906
02:32:55,910 --> 02:32:58,400
construction,
a carpenter's helper,

2907
02:32:59,840 --> 02:33:03,320
and he hired me.
I went the first day you had to work for

2908
02:33:03,321 --> 02:33:05,720
free.
For free.

2909
02:33:05,740 --> 02:33:07,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

2910
02:33:07,370 --> 02:33:08,390
So I said,
okay.

2911
02:33:08,391 --> 02:33:11,540
I agreed to it.
I made our first date worked for free.

2912
02:33:11,630 --> 02:33:14,900
I cut this stuff and you've got to go 
get lunch and the whole thing.

2913
02:33:14,901 --> 02:33:15,651
Yeah,
okay.

2914
02:33:15,651 --> 02:33:19,940
I did it.
I passed and then the guy would say,

2915
02:33:19,941 --> 02:33:20,774
okay,
meet me at a diner at eight and when I 

2916
02:33:23,871 --> 02:33:26,300
go get paid,
he'd say,

2917
02:33:26,301 --> 02:33:27,950
what's those hours?
And I go,

2918
02:33:27,951 --> 02:33:31,160
you told me to meet you at eight.
He goes on no job or windshield time.

2919
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:35,630
So let's say that job,
we didn't get to the job by 10.

2920
02:33:36,650 --> 02:33:39,830
That's when you start getting paid.
That's when I started getting paid and I

2921
02:33:39,831 --> 02:33:40,910
was,
you know,

2922
02:33:40,970 --> 02:33:42,890
I was at,
I was really trying.

2923
02:33:42,920 --> 02:33:45,830
I lived with a friend that wanted to 
give them rent money.

2924
02:33:46,430 --> 02:33:49,210
I was trying to put away some money.
I forget what he paid me.

2925
02:33:49,220 --> 02:33:52,130
He didn't pay.
He made me pay for my own lunch.

2926
02:33:52,700 --> 02:33:54,370
Then one day he said,
uh,

2927
02:33:54,410 --> 02:33:58,160
where's your white belt,
your work belt?

2928
02:33:58,350 --> 02:33:59,570
Like I don't have one.
He goes,

2929
02:33:59,571 --> 02:34:00,404
okay,
I'll pay you have to pay me for the 

2930
02:34:02,750 --> 02:34:04,640
materials.
Plus 30 percent,

2931
02:34:06,500 --> 02:34:07,610
30 percent.
YeAh.

2932
02:34:07,611 --> 02:34:08,444
You're a fucking scumbag just to have 
like a claw up fucking hammer and a 

2933
02:34:13,250 --> 02:34:16,270
something else.
I forget what it was to work for him to,

2934
02:34:16,390 --> 02:34:19,530
to have your own and stuff like that.
Yeah,

2935
02:34:19,540 --> 02:34:20,720
there was always a thing,
um,

2936
02:34:21,010 --> 02:34:23,290
whether it's union or non union,

2937
02:34:24,760 --> 02:34:25,830
you know,
there was a lot of.

2938
02:34:25,850 --> 02:34:29,560
The work that I did when I was a kid was
non union and a lot of the people didn't

2939
02:34:29,561 --> 02:34:31,330
want a union.
They felt like the union guys,

2940
02:34:31,720 --> 02:34:33,340
they had it easier,
but it was,

2941
02:34:33,430 --> 02:34:36,510
it was too expensive and people didn't 
want to know,

2942
02:34:36,520 --> 02:34:37,600
use certain people.
So it's,

2943
02:34:37,750 --> 02:34:38,583
it was like a real debate.
Like whaT's better is for every amount 

2944
02:34:41,171 --> 02:34:42,004
of union people,
you have to have a certain amount nine 

2945
02:34:43,760 --> 02:34:45,740
union because that works to balance it 
out.

2946
02:34:45,741 --> 02:34:47,260
Right.
So everybody makes money,

2947
02:34:47,290 --> 02:34:49,120
but it seems like in some things like 
auto workers,

2948
02:34:49,121 --> 02:34:50,520
they don't fuck around.
Right?

2949
02:34:50,860 --> 02:34:55,720
Like everybody has to be under 
construction is different breaks,

2950
02:34:55,721 --> 02:35:00,721
glory time lists.
If a job opens up,

2951
02:35:01,031 --> 02:35:02,710
how do we get it?
You gotta go on the list.

2952
02:35:03,220 --> 02:35:07,690
Rogan has little minority than diaz.
He started nine months before diaz.

2953
02:35:08,170 --> 02:35:09,680
He gets the job.
Yeah.

2954
02:35:09,970 --> 02:35:10,803
You know,
it's not about knowing all that shit 

2955
02:35:12,131 --> 02:35:12,970
with that.
Dude.

2956
02:35:13,490 --> 02:35:16,500
I'll never forget that news and what he 
did,

2957
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:19,420
the scumbag he was to me,
but um,

2958
02:35:19,460 --> 02:35:23,080
fridays he would make me feel bad like 
he goes,

2959
02:35:23,081 --> 02:35:25,790
so how many hours did you work?
And I'd go 38 a,

2960
02:35:25,810 --> 02:35:28,000
no,
I'm paying you for 30.

2961
02:35:28,001 --> 02:35:29,350
And he bullied me,
this guy,

2962
02:35:30,070 --> 02:35:32,800
but every friday go this friday I'm 
going away.

2963
02:35:32,810 --> 02:35:35,350
I'm going here to fuck my wife and the 
ass.

2964
02:35:35,351 --> 02:35:36,184
And he was always an asshole.
And Then all of a sudden I got my 

2965
02:35:38,540 --> 02:35:40,480
concern,
my check.

2966
02:35:40,980 --> 02:35:44,820
I got this checkout was waiting for and 
one saturday I'm sitting down,

2967
02:35:44,821 --> 02:35:46,240
I'm like,
I'm sick of this motherfucker.

2968
02:35:46,241 --> 02:35:47,074
I'm going to rob his house.
and I jumped the fence and I kicked the 

2969
02:35:50,051 --> 02:35:53,740
back door.
And he was the guy that bought hot shit

2970
02:35:54,970 --> 02:35:55,803
on the side.
He stolen the guy was just a bus sack 

2971
02:35:58,131 --> 02:36:01,540
that shit.
And he must have had,

2972
02:36:02,290 --> 02:36:06,190
I don't know how many fucking bottles 
and cases of dom perignon.

2973
02:36:07,380 --> 02:36:10,540
so I fucking ran up to the corner,
call my buddy,

2974
02:36:10,541 --> 02:36:11,374
go meet me at this address.
And I took every bottle of dom perignon 

2975
02:36:15,191 --> 02:36:17,380
and he had,
I sold them at liquor stores.

2976
02:36:17,830 --> 02:36:21,610
I took his checkbook.
I mean I buried this fucking guy.

2977
02:36:21,640 --> 02:36:25,420
Just how bad he treated me with such a 
fucking scumbag.

2978
02:36:26,230 --> 02:36:29,830
Never bought lunch.
He was always making credit.

2979
02:36:29,831 --> 02:36:30,664
You know?
He's always making little fucking 

2980
02:36:31,481 --> 02:36:32,740
remarks.
Well,

2981
02:36:32,741 --> 02:36:33,820
that's what we were talking about 
earlier.

2982
02:36:33,821 --> 02:36:35,980
What happens when a guy gets into power?
That's a piece of shit.

2983
02:36:37,530 --> 02:36:41,040
Fuck it.
Yeah.

2984
02:36:41,041 --> 02:36:43,170
I remember I had this tee shirt for a 
long time.

2985
02:36:43,171 --> 02:36:48,171
I useD to work and smile every time jay 
has some shit like that.

2986
02:36:48,571 --> 02:36:49,404
Fuck him.
That's half what this harvey weinstein 

2987
02:36:52,501 --> 02:36:53,334
thing is about,
right?

2988
02:36:53,340 --> 02:36:55,530
It's about the boss.
Yeah,

2989
02:36:55,650 --> 02:36:58,680
that's what it's about.
It's about the boss abusing his power to

2990
02:36:58,681 --> 02:37:02,250
boss fucking the girls so they can get 
the job.

2991
02:37:02,430 --> 02:37:07,180
And that's the offer which has probably 
been going on forever.

2992
02:37:08,510 --> 02:37:09,970
Like I said,
especially here.

2993
02:37:10,540 --> 02:37:12,760
Listen,
they destroyed Marilyn Monroe and that's

2994
02:37:12,761 --> 02:37:15,840
the ones we know of now.
Millions,

2995
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:18,470
millions of women that have come out of 
here.

2996
02:37:19,210 --> 02:37:22,000
I been put through a fucking process.
It was always what?

2997
02:37:22,040 --> 02:37:23,240
How these guys got power.
I mean,

2998
02:37:23,241 --> 02:37:25,820
if you look at a guy like harvey,
how else is he going to get laid?

2999
02:37:26,090 --> 02:37:27,560
Let's be hoNest.
I mean,

3000
02:37:27,561 --> 02:37:28,394
is he going to get laid because he's a 
good looking guy or is he going to get 

3001
02:37:29,901 --> 02:37:32,780
laid because he's ruthless and very 
successful?

3002
02:37:32,781 --> 02:37:34,760
It would have to be ruthless and very 
successful.

3003
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:39,440
I want to know like of some slept with 
him and did a lot.

3004
02:37:40,190 --> 02:37:40,821
Well,
I don't know,

3005
02:37:40,821 --> 02:37:41,654
that didn't win,
but I mean there's a lot that did the 

3006
02:37:43,401 --> 02:37:45,800
story is that there was a lot that that 
did it.

3007
02:37:45,801 --> 02:37:46,210
I mean,
he,

3008
02:37:46,210 --> 02:37:48,830
he couldn't have made these offers.
All these women that said,

3009
02:37:48,831 --> 02:37:49,700
no,
I'm not.

3010
02:37:49,701 --> 02:37:53,360
Have some of them say yes,
it doesn't make It any less horrible for

3011
02:37:53,361 --> 02:37:54,194
the women who said no and were hounded 
by them and whatever went down and he 

3012
02:37:57,531 --> 02:37:58,940
ruined some careers and.

3013
02:37:59,810 --> 02:38:04,130
But some of them had to say yes.
It's just some would make that deal with

3014
02:38:04,131 --> 02:38:04,964
the devil.
That happens with a lot of different 

3015
02:38:06,921 --> 02:38:08,660
things.
People make that deal,

3016
02:38:08,720 --> 02:38:10,010
they make that deal.
It's worth it.

3017
02:38:10,610 --> 02:38:11,870
You know?
I mean,

3018
02:38:11,871 --> 02:38:14,780
I joked around about it and my act about
harvey weinstein,

3019
02:38:15,560 --> 02:38:18,770
but that's,
that's what a lot of guys would do.

3020
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:22,420
A lot of guys a bang,
some check If that's all it took and you

3021
02:38:22,421 --> 02:38:24,500
can get ahead.
You know,

3022
02:38:25,160 --> 02:38:26,590
you don't have to marry,
you just have to fuck her.

3023
02:38:27,350 --> 02:38:28,183
How many guys would do that?
A lot of guys would do that with girls 

3024
02:38:30,651 --> 02:38:32,000
do that too.
Some of them,

3025
02:38:32,630 --> 02:38:33,463
yeah.
Most would not want that to be stuck in 

3026
02:38:35,391 --> 02:38:37,580
front of their face.
Most would rather make their way through

3027
02:38:37,581 --> 02:38:40,610
the most.
The vast majority would rather get by on

3028
02:38:40,611 --> 02:38:41,444
their merits,
but there's always for throughout time 

3029
02:38:43,400 --> 02:38:44,990
there's been people that fuck the way to
the top.

3030
02:38:45,020 --> 02:38:47,140
That's not a myth.
That's not like angels.

3031
02:38:47,360 --> 02:38:50,810
It's not like pick season would else.
People have done it.

3032
02:38:51,470 --> 02:38:53,060
People have done everything that you can
imagine.

3033
02:38:53,061 --> 02:38:53,894
People have married people for money.
People have killed people for their 

3034
02:38:56,001 --> 02:39:00,020
insurance premiums or their insurance 
policies rather.

3035
02:39:00,410 --> 02:39:03,230
That's.
That happens when people die.

3036
02:39:03,290 --> 02:39:06,710
They checked the spouse to see if the 
spouse had a fucking insurance polIcy.

3037
02:39:06,790 --> 02:39:09,230
If they find that they recently put out 
a big fat insurance policy,

3038
02:39:09,231 --> 02:39:11,280
then they go sideways and go,
oh teacher,

3039
02:39:11,570 --> 02:39:13,370
and she just vanished in the woods.
Huh?

3040
02:39:13,640 --> 02:39:14,473
That's weird.
mike.

3041
02:39:14,560 --> 02:39:15,393
mike,
have a seat.

3042
02:39:15,650 --> 02:39:17,810
We're going to talk.
What happened again?

3043
02:39:17,811 --> 02:39:19,550
Mike,
let's just take me through the top.

3044
02:39:19,940 --> 02:39:20,773
Tell me what happened.
You can just go hiking in Colorado with 

3045
02:39:23,400 --> 02:39:24,233
one.
That was another one was another one 

3046
02:39:25,521 --> 02:39:27,440
that just happened in Colorado with the 
phone.

3047
02:39:27,510 --> 02:39:30,290
Ended up in Idaho.
Miles away.

3048
02:39:31,190 --> 02:39:34,280
They saw her leave the supermarket with 
the child.

3049
02:39:35,360 --> 02:39:36,193
He supposedly picked her up.
I want to know how he got the phone up 

3050
02:39:40,431 --> 02:39:43,850
there.
Every car's gps now.

3051
02:39:44,240 --> 02:39:45,990
Yeah.
Car.

3052
02:39:46,250 --> 02:39:48,720
Unless it's an old truck or you know 
there's.

3053
02:39:48,750 --> 02:39:50,780
There's cars that they have the don't 
have gps.

3054
02:39:50,960 --> 02:39:52,340
This cars.
You can get them stripped.

3055
02:39:52,400 --> 02:39:54,590
They don't have shit in them,
but I get a really cheap car.

3056
02:39:54,680 --> 02:39:56,000
truck.
Pickup truck.

3057
02:39:56,001 --> 02:39:57,370
No radio.
That's the.

3058
02:39:57,440 --> 02:40:00,980
That's the one that baffles me.
How to fucking get the Idaho.

3059
02:40:01,220 --> 02:40:02,990
How about the fucking guy killed his 
whole family.

3060
02:40:03,110 --> 02:40:05,750
How about that guy got kIlled.
His wife killed his kids.

3061
02:40:06,110 --> 02:40:09,510
You hear about that guy?
Fuck jesus christ,

3062
02:40:09,710 --> 02:40:12,920
and he looked so normally you see a 
picture of him and as mr came,

3063
02:40:13,480 --> 02:40:14,080
yeah,
to

3064
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:15,960
mrs heyman,
but you look at him,

3065
02:40:15,961 --> 02:40:17,640
the picture him with his family.
You go,

3066
02:40:17,670 --> 02:40:21,240
that guy looks so fucking far more 
capable of killing his own kid.

3067
02:40:21,390 --> 02:40:22,223
How is he capable of killing his wife?
there's certain people out there that 

3068
02:40:25,400 --> 02:40:26,233
just fucking broken.
They're broken and you and if you're a 

3069
02:40:29,281 --> 02:40:30,660
woman,
you have to think about that.

3070
02:40:30,750 --> 02:40:32,430
That's the difference between women and 
men.

3071
02:40:32,460 --> 02:40:33,293
That's the bIggest difference.
The biggest difference is women have to 

3072
02:40:36,391 --> 02:40:37,224
constantly be in fear of a violent man.
Whereas men rarely are in fear of a 

3073
02:40:41,611 --> 02:40:43,260
violent woman.
It doesn't mean it doesn't happen.

3074
02:40:43,440 --> 02:40:46,620
It happened to my friend phil hartman,
his wife shot him while he was asleep.

3075
02:40:46,650 --> 02:40:48,960
That did happen,
but the vast majority,

3076
02:40:48,961 --> 02:40:49,794
if you're looking at the numbers of 
people that are afraid of the opposite 

3077
02:40:52,681 --> 02:40:54,270
sex,
it's women that are afraid of men.

3078
02:40:54,360 --> 02:40:55,410
It's a different environment.

3079
02:40:55,410 --> 02:40:57,090
It's a different.
It's a different dynamic.

3080
02:40:57,810 --> 02:41:00,000
It's not like anything that we could 
ever really,

3081
02:41:00,001 --> 02:41:00,834
truly appreciate it.
If you know how to handle yourself in 

3082
02:41:02,610 --> 02:41:05,430
that case that happened in Colorado 
where he killed,

3083
02:41:05,431 --> 02:41:08,580
Is there any past the best of violence?
I don't think so.

3084
02:41:08,730 --> 02:41:10,830
I don't think so.
We just snapped one day,

3085
02:41:10,831 --> 02:41:11,664
bro.
It doesn't make any sense that this guy 

3086
02:41:13,420 --> 02:41:15,180
here.
Like I said,

3087
02:41:15,181 --> 02:41:19,970
the only thing that flows you off is her
car folded.

3088
02:41:19,990 --> 02:41:20,823
I know.
Which meant he had to take her right 

3089
02:41:23,041 --> 02:41:25,090
there,
drive to Idaho,

3090
02:41:25,170 --> 02:41:26,003
which has to be 11 to 12 hours and drive
back 770 miles away and drive back 

3091
02:41:33,661 --> 02:41:34,494
without nobody noticing.
It's totally possible gas station 

3092
02:41:37,021 --> 02:41:40,770
attendants recognizing a truck with a 
child in the back.

3093
02:41:41,250 --> 02:41:42,083
You know they have to do a search of 
every gas station camera to see if he 

3094
02:41:46,531 --> 02:41:48,120
pulled up and they didn't find him.

3095
02:41:48,320 --> 02:41:49,153
I didn't.
I don't think they've even gone that 

3096
02:41:51,481 --> 02:41:52,314
deep so far,
but they got to figure out our cell 

3097
02:41:55,081 --> 02:42:00,081
phone ended up fucking mailbox.
I just don't understand where people get

3098
02:42:00,901 --> 02:42:05,901
the fucking.
It is so tough.

3099
02:42:07,140 --> 02:42:08,190
The ice.
Somebody.

3100
02:42:08,210 --> 02:42:11,820
Now you're going to get away with it.
Between cell phones,

3101
02:42:11,880 --> 02:42:14,910
drones,
cam pictures.

3102
02:42:15,720 --> 02:42:18,690
Think about you.
Think about it.

3103
02:42:18,740 --> 02:42:20,040
How they find that?
Everything.

3104
02:42:20,250 --> 02:42:21,750
It's way more difficult,
that's for sure.

3105
02:42:21,751 --> 02:42:24,930
But a rural area,
rural areas,

3106
02:42:24,931 --> 02:42:26,460
you can still get away with the law.
No,

3107
02:42:26,560 --> 02:42:27,393
no,
no.

3108
02:42:27,620 --> 02:42:30,600
Look at that chick that was jogging from
the university of whatever.

3109
02:42:30,660 --> 02:42:31,260
Oh,
that's right.

3110
02:42:31,260 --> 02:42:34,330
Yeah.
They buy the whole Iowa,

3111
02:42:34,400 --> 02:42:35,430
Iowa,
Iowa,

3112
02:42:35,431 --> 02:42:39,120
and they caught her with a something a 
quarter with a drunk.

3113
02:42:39,150 --> 02:42:42,230
I don't know exactly the number.
It's very tough to.

3114
02:42:42,270 --> 02:42:44,360
I gotta pee so bad.
Well then go ahead.

3115
02:42:44,580 --> 02:42:45,420
Do your thing,
brother.

3116
02:42:45,960 --> 02:42:46,590
I'm going to have pets.

3117
02:42:46,590 --> 02:42:48,180
Talk to jamie and I'll come back.
I'm not done yet,

3118
02:42:48,570 --> 02:42:51,930
but hurry up and shit like that.
It's thE holiday season.

3119
02:42:52,500 --> 02:42:53,333
You're sitting around right now thinking
you see what's going on with joe rogan 

3120
02:42:56,050 --> 02:42:58,310
as what happens when you turn 50 
motherfuckers,

3121
02:42:58,320 --> 02:43:01,680
so prepare you to drink your water.
You try to be healthy,

3122
02:43:02,100 --> 02:43:02,933
but you got to pee all fucking day.
This is what I live with every fucking 

3123
02:43:06,361 --> 02:43:07,194
night I go to bed.
I'm nice and sleepy and at one point I 

3124
02:43:10,021 --> 02:43:12,490
got to fucking.
You got up and pee and you got to and it

3125
02:43:12,491 --> 02:43:13,324
comes out nice and slow to really 
torture you to really make you think 

3126
02:43:16,451 --> 02:43:17,284
about that ham and cheese sandwich and 
the fucking refrigerator so you stay up 

3127
02:43:20,830 --> 02:43:22,780
and eat that fucking thing.
That god.

3128
02:43:24,010 --> 02:43:24,843
It's merry christmas time.
This is the best fucking time because 

3129
02:43:27,071 --> 02:43:29,770
listen,
I ain't doin dicto thursday.

3130
02:43:29,770 --> 02:43:31,330
You understand me?
How about you jamie?

3131
02:43:32,280 --> 02:43:35,830
Nothin nothin.
I ain't doin dictal thursday tonight.

3132
02:43:35,831 --> 02:43:38,010
I'm going to gracious with my wife and 
kid.

3133
02:43:38,740 --> 02:43:39,573
We're gonna.
Sing mingled jingle bells and all that 

3134
02:43:41,141 --> 02:43:42,790
shit.
All the kids get together.

3135
02:43:43,540 --> 02:43:46,830
I'll probably be home by nine tomorrow 
and doing deck.

3136
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:51,370
And how do an open mic at the gym 
tomorrow for jujitsu,

3137
02:43:51,371 --> 02:43:52,204
I might have to go down at 12 just to 
get some exercise so you can use an 

3138
02:43:56,211 --> 02:43:57,044
excuse to eat.
I'm thinking about dropping into their 

3139
02:43:59,390 --> 02:44:02,470
store on christmas night.
It might be boring,

3140
02:44:02,471 --> 02:44:06,610
but it might be an adventure.
Then wednesday I got dick for thursday,

3141
02:44:06,611 --> 02:44:07,690
friday,
saturday.

3142
02:44:08,470 --> 02:44:11,350
I'm up there and parks.
Not at a level he lives.

3143
02:44:11,400 --> 02:44:15,560
That'll be fun listening.
It's the weekend before new years.

3144
02:44:15,940 --> 02:44:16,773
Will the folks on this show,
people are going to be waiting for new 

3145
02:44:18,441 --> 02:44:20,580
orleans because that's what people do.

3146
02:44:20,610 --> 02:44:21,490
They go,
you know what,

3147
02:44:22,060 --> 02:44:24,820
I'm just gonna wait for new year's eve 
and jump up and down.

3148
02:44:25,180 --> 02:44:27,460
I fuckin hate new years eve.
You understand me?

3149
02:44:27,461 --> 02:44:31,310
I've always said since I was 18,
eight new year's eve,

3150
02:44:31,311 --> 02:44:33,310
you asked me,
why do you ain't pocket new year's?

3151
02:44:33,311 --> 02:44:37,870
Eve does weird things happened when I 
was 18 or 17.

3152
02:44:38,320 --> 02:44:42,190
I saw an rx seven had a fucking tree on 
new year's eve.

3153
02:44:42,191 --> 02:44:45,940
When the car got split in half and they 
had the kid was dead.

3154
02:44:46,450 --> 02:44:47,283
The girl got taken out By the jaws that 
then the following year I went to a 

3155
02:44:50,921 --> 02:44:55,921
party and I saw my buddy danny be bite 
off roger here and we had to drive me to

3156
02:44:56,721 --> 02:45:00,970
the fucking hospital with a piece of air
in the fucking baggy with ice cubes,

3157
02:45:01,390 --> 02:45:05,740
so that's why you never saw me drink on 
new year's eve any other time.

3158
02:45:05,741 --> 02:45:06,574
It even through you at 364 days a year 
for me to snort coke and he pills and 

3159
02:45:12,161 --> 02:45:12,994
drink.
when it came to new year's eve and 

3160
02:45:15,290 --> 02:45:17,350
minding my fucking business,
why?

3161
02:45:17,770 --> 02:45:19,750
Because it's just a creeping.
In fact,

3162
02:45:20,320 --> 02:45:23,770
I'm excited that joe rogan's not doing 
new year's this year.

3163
02:45:27,060 --> 02:45:28,770
I saw that.
Is that what happened?

3164
02:45:28,771 --> 02:45:29,880
The guy fell asleep.
Yeah,

3165
02:45:30,030 --> 02:45:31,230
I saw that.
Walked away.

3166
02:45:31,710 --> 02:45:34,890
I heard probably because he was asleep.
I thought it was in a dream.

3167
02:45:34,891 --> 02:45:36,840
It didn't stiffen up.
That was in another country,

3168
02:45:36,841 --> 02:45:37,674
right?
Like olivia,

3169
02:45:38,040 --> 02:45:38,873
dude,
I paid more than I've ever played in my 

3170
02:45:39,451 --> 02:45:43,200
life right now actually.
That got my blood done recently.

3171
02:45:43,230 --> 02:45:44,850
Got everything checked up.
Everything's groovy,

3172
02:45:44,851 --> 02:45:48,330
but I was dehydrated so I've been making
a point to drink more water.

3173
02:45:50,010 --> 02:45:52,230
What if I keep myself d hide,
but that doesn't make any sense.

3174
02:45:52,231 --> 02:45:53,064
Could I drink during the show?
But I want if I do that subconsciously 

3175
02:45:55,231 --> 02:45:58,260
to limit my needing to pee during three 
hour conversations.

3176
02:45:58,470 --> 02:46:00,500
No,
I don't think so either.

3177
02:46:00,960 --> 02:46:05,500
I drink water all fucking day.
Every time I won't go to the dentist.

3178
02:46:05,630 --> 02:46:08,580
A doctor for a physical.
He always says,

3179
02:46:08,581 --> 02:46:09,820
drink more.
You die.

3180
02:46:09,850 --> 02:46:10,030
well,

3181
02:46:10,030 --> 02:46:12,110
he used to always just drink more water.
It doesn't hurt.

3182
02:46:12,200 --> 02:46:12,970
And you know what?
I,

3183
02:46:12,970 --> 02:46:16,400
I sleep with water next to me,
which is big d,

3184
02:46:16,430 --> 02:46:19,190
get up and have a sip of water.
I'll get up pee,

3185
02:46:19,340 --> 02:46:20,173
drink a fucking gown,
the water because of the sleep apnea 

3186
02:46:23,931 --> 02:46:26,630
machines to put a fluid in the.
Well,

3187
02:46:27,380 --> 02:46:29,900
I just bring a bottle of water with me 
next door,

3188
02:46:30,050 --> 02:46:30,883
right to the bedroom at night.
And it's really important if you read 

3189
02:46:33,261 --> 02:46:34,094
it,
there's a reason.

3190
02:46:34,520 --> 02:46:35,930
There's a reason why,
you know,

3191
02:46:36,020 --> 02:46:38,210
because when you're over 50 you pee 
more,

3192
02:46:38,930 --> 02:46:39,763
but there's a rate.
you have to look it up when you're by 

3193
02:46:41,751 --> 02:46:45,950
yourself next time in the hotel room,
there's a reason why you should sleep.

3194
02:46:45,980 --> 02:46:50,330
Diet hydrated when you're over 50 big 
reason why.

3195
02:46:50,600 --> 02:46:51,500
Well,
whenever I can,

3196
02:46:51,830 --> 02:46:54,610
whenever I gO to yoga class,
I always feel like,

3197
02:46:54,611 --> 02:46:55,444
uh,
I have to make a conscious effort to 

3198
02:46:57,621 --> 02:47:00,800
take that fluid back in because you 
sweat so much.

3199
02:47:00,800 --> 02:47:01,633
One of those hot yoga classes,
like if you don't make a real like 

3200
02:47:04,490 --> 02:47:06,140
conscious drink,
if you're thirsty,

3201
02:47:06,380 --> 02:47:07,213
you got to make kind of a conscious 
effort to get those fluids back in your 

3202
02:47:09,201 --> 02:47:10,034
body.
And you probably should take some 

3203
02:47:10,371 --> 02:47:13,420
electrolytes to some sort of 
electrolytes up.

3204
02:47:13,490 --> 02:47:15,470
I just blast the fucking banana,
man.

3205
02:47:15,500 --> 02:47:17,630
That's good too.
I blast to bananas.

3206
02:47:17,690 --> 02:47:21,770
You stay full for an hour to two after 
you eat.

3207
02:47:22,340 --> 02:47:24,800
I drink water and I also drink a 
fucking,

3208
02:47:24,820 --> 02:47:27,290
uh,
the after workout drink.

3209
02:47:27,291 --> 02:47:29,860
Sometimes bananas are good right before 
you work.

3210
02:47:29,930 --> 02:47:31,430
No pump,
no calories,

3211
02:47:31,431 --> 02:47:34,060
no sugar,
no gatorade,

3212
02:47:34,070 --> 02:47:37,490
no fucking monster energy drink.
I don't touch none of that shit.

3213
02:47:37,491 --> 02:47:38,324
I hate all that shit.
You all that's just going to kill 

3214
02:47:40,810 --> 02:47:41,643
fucking people 20 years from now.
Monster energy and all those energy 

3215
02:47:45,321 --> 02:47:48,200
drinks and shit like that.
They don't kill people on.

3216
02:47:48,440 --> 02:47:52,010
My favorite thing is just coffee before 
any kind of workout.

3217
02:47:52,400 --> 02:47:53,233
Just coffee.
Do you know that before I go to the 

3218
02:47:55,251 --> 02:47:57,490
store?
You know,

3219
02:47:57,500 --> 02:48:02,500
before I go to the store,
I'd drink a four express shots.

3220
02:48:05,050 --> 02:48:08,040
I usually drink one of these,
either shameless plug,

3221
02:48:08,200 --> 02:48:10,880
caveman nitros,
even my wife ago.

3222
02:48:11,100 --> 02:48:16,100
How big is that thing?
And I put that cancer sugar in there and

3223
02:48:18,381 --> 02:48:21,740
I fucking get sugar free.
Sugar saccharin again,

3224
02:48:21,750 --> 02:48:23,360
that fucking call.
And I don't know,

3225
02:48:23,361 --> 02:48:24,194
music is sugar.
It's just me and four cups of express 

3226
02:48:27,601 --> 02:48:28,434
over.
Do you know what's going through my 

3227
02:48:28,941 --> 02:48:30,950
mind?
If I have the ball,

3228
02:48:30,951 --> 02:48:31,784
sometimes I take a toke off the pipe 
just to cook the espresso upper level 

3229
02:48:35,960 --> 02:48:38,540
and I pop a nicotine gum.
Oh my god.

3230
02:48:38,560 --> 02:48:39,393
You.
I'm juiced up by the time I get to the 

3231
02:48:40,971 --> 02:48:44,370
comedy store because that's when I put 
myself through the nicotine.

3232
02:48:44,420 --> 02:48:47,510
Nicotine guM is supposed to be legit.
Like from what I understand,

3233
02:48:47,511 --> 02:48:50,690
nicotine itself is a really good 
nootropic.

3234
02:48:50,780 --> 02:48:51,613
They've,
they've analyzed the cognitive benefits 

3235
02:48:53,571 --> 02:48:55,880
of nicotine on its own,
but it's addictive.

3236
02:48:55,881 --> 02:48:56,714
So it's,
it's nicotine gum is very healthy for 

3237
02:48:58,941 --> 02:48:59,774
you,
but if there was a way it giVes you a 

3238
02:49:00,291 --> 02:49:00,970
juice,
right?

3239
02:49:00,970 --> 02:49:05,970
If there was a way to blast nicotine,
like maybe chew it like a tobacco,

3240
02:49:06,831 --> 02:49:08,250
like a clean tobacco.

3241
02:49:08,250 --> 02:49:11,610
Just to give you a little push off the 
cliff.

3242
02:49:11,910 --> 02:49:13,620
Yeah,
I think it's not bad for you.

3243
02:49:13,621 --> 02:49:16,230
I remember one,
one of the things that it really shocked

3244
02:49:16,231 --> 02:49:18,930
me,
the cops were looking for me,

3245
02:49:18,931 --> 02:49:19,764
so I jumped on a bus in san francisco in
1985 and I didn't even know the buses 

3246
02:49:23,881 --> 02:49:28,881
going was going to a place called reno.
I had never heard of the marina and when

3247
02:49:29,391 --> 02:49:30,224
those days you could smoke on a bus and 
met a kids from whatever Egypt and he 

3248
02:49:35,311 --> 02:49:38,820
smoked with me.
At that time I was never touched tobacco

3249
02:49:38,821 --> 02:49:41,550
product,
never even consider it.

3250
02:49:41,551 --> 02:49:45,240
I thought I'm cuban.
Cigars were the worst thing in the world

3251
02:49:45,241 --> 02:49:46,074
for you.
And I remember we smoked a joint with 

3252
02:49:48,991 --> 02:49:51,720
hash.
We end tobacco in it.

3253
02:49:52,350 --> 02:49:53,740
We Thought,
huh?

3254
02:49:54,090 --> 02:49:56,460
What year was this?
Nineteen 85.

3255
02:49:57,480 --> 02:49:59,430
We smoked a joint on a bus.
I don't.

3256
02:49:59,430 --> 02:50:04,250
My lungs were going to fucking cave and 
when the tobacco and the hash east,

3257
02:50:04,350 --> 02:50:09,350
because the problem with ashes,
no matter what you smoke hash,

3258
02:50:10,620 --> 02:50:13,730
it doubles in your lungs.
What do you mean it?

3259
02:50:14,090 --> 02:50:17,430
The smoke doubles in your lungs.
How's it do that?

3260
02:50:17,770 --> 02:50:20,110
I do.
I look like johnny fucking scientists.

3261
02:50:21,360 --> 02:50:25,960
Next time we'll have these smart guys 
comes on this show as well.

3262
02:50:26,210 --> 02:50:28,320
I usually smoke hash.
I take a pen.

3263
02:50:29,120 --> 02:50:32,160
You know those pens that people put 
jewelry on fire,

3264
02:50:32,250 --> 02:50:36,630
put it under glass and put it under a 
glass and you smoke it clean because the

3265
02:50:36,680 --> 02:50:37,513
way that we.
That straight the ash and there was 

3266
02:50:41,011 --> 02:50:44,400
something else with double up in your 
fucking lungs.

3267
02:50:44,940 --> 02:50:46,590
That's why you call so hard.

3268
02:50:46,870 --> 02:50:49,330
I remember when it expands,
expands,

3269
02:50:49,360 --> 02:50:51,670
expands.
I remember when I was a super square,

3270
02:50:51,671 --> 02:50:53,350
I never did any drugs,
never smoked pot,

3271
02:50:53,351 --> 02:50:55,670
never did anything and I went to a,
an a,

3272
02:50:55,700 --> 02:50:58,240
an agent's room.
I think we're in montreal.

3273
02:50:58,270 --> 02:50:59,103
It was me and my manager and this agent 
who was a friend of ours and he had a 

3274
02:51:03,251 --> 02:51:07,780
piece of hash that he lit on like a 
thumbtack under glass.

3275
02:51:07,781 --> 02:51:10,220
He blows and it blows on it and he puts 
the lid on it.

3276
02:51:10,221 --> 02:51:13,630
I'm watching him and then he smokes the 
hash out of it and I was like,

3277
02:51:13,660 --> 02:51:15,430
I can't believe I'm seeing this guy do 
drugs.

3278
02:51:15,730 --> 02:51:18,070
Like this is like a scene in hollywood.
He's out here.

3279
02:51:18,280 --> 02:51:21,540
He's doing drugs.
He's smoking drugs like says hash.

3280
02:51:21,860 --> 02:51:24,490
You know what I thought of hash that 
fucking movie midnight express.

3281
02:51:24,491 --> 02:51:25,420
That's what I thought.
Oh my god,

3282
02:51:25,421 --> 02:51:26,254
you gotta go to jail for life.
You're going to jerk off on the glass 

3283
02:51:28,120 --> 02:51:30,190
like you're gonna have to fight someone 
and kill them.

3284
02:51:30,670 --> 02:51:33,430
Midnight express is about smoking hash 
from Turkey.

3285
02:51:33,570 --> 02:51:34,403
That's in my mind.
Hash was a serious fucking drug like 

3286
02:51:38,081 --> 02:51:40,510
this guy was doing heroin like you're 
doing hash.

3287
02:51:40,620 --> 02:51:41,860
You might as well be doing heroin.
I was like,

3288
02:51:41,861 --> 02:51:43,300
I can't believe she's doing this in 
front of me.

3289
02:51:46,450 --> 02:51:47,283
Smoking hash and front,
the people with a glass scares the fuck 

3290
02:51:49,841 --> 02:51:50,674
out.
It's a for someone who doesn't do 

3291
02:51:52,331 --> 02:51:55,060
anything like that's a big hit.
The hit of a joint.

3292
02:51:55,120 --> 02:51:56,380
He took a hit of a joint and go,
okay,

3293
02:51:56,381 --> 02:51:58,210
god likes to smoke pot.
I've seen that before.

3294
02:51:58,810 --> 02:52:03,810
You light a piece of hash and put it on 
a thumb tack and put it under that glass

3295
02:52:03,950 --> 02:52:06,250
and get there and suck it out of the 
glass.

3296
02:52:06,251 --> 02:52:07,084
You creaTe a drug addict,
your speech sniffing and exhaust fume 

3297
02:52:09,520 --> 02:52:12,730
the fuck are you doing man?
If you know anything about me,

3298
02:52:12,731 --> 02:52:15,460
you know I've seen some people do some 
drugs shit.

3299
02:52:15,810 --> 02:52:16,643
When I was in New York and when I got up
early and there's a movie called sugar 

3300
02:52:19,121 --> 02:52:20,340
hill.
You don't want sugar hill.

3301
02:52:20,800 --> 02:52:25,120
Sugar hill.
I remember the sugarhill gang related.

3302
02:52:25,300 --> 02:52:29,680
Sugar hill is a movie that is possibly 
wesley snipes.

3303
02:52:29,680 --> 02:52:30,513
Best movie.
That was when they were the drug 

3304
02:52:33,791 --> 02:52:36,080
dealers.
Drug dealers can.

3305
02:52:36,190 --> 02:52:39,040
the alexander opens up the movie.
Oh yeah.

3306
02:52:39,041 --> 02:52:43,030
Because she plays the mother and she 
makes them oldeR belt and he goes,

3307
02:52:43,031 --> 02:52:44,830
why are you gonna?
Make me hold the belt mama,

3308
02:52:44,831 --> 02:52:47,080
because you're the oldest.
Hold the belts.

3309
02:52:47,090 --> 02:52:49,510
I could shoot this goddamn Maryland 
mama's sick.

3310
02:52:49,570 --> 02:52:50,380
Oh,
that's right.

3311
02:52:50,380 --> 02:52:53,860
This is his best movie by fucking fall.
That was a good movie.

3312
02:52:54,340 --> 02:52:55,390
Joe.
I gotta wrap this up.

3313
02:52:56,740 --> 02:52:59,800
What are we going to do it how we're 
going to kick open the new year?

3314
02:53:00,370 --> 02:53:02,120
We didn't lay a bet.
Nothing.

3315
02:53:02,160 --> 02:53:05,550
Nothing about fucking John Jones 
gusteson.

3316
02:53:05,560 --> 02:53:09,120
If he had a better.
You didn't give me a breakdown here that

3317
02:53:09,130 --> 02:53:10,890
John Jones versus gustafson.
Yeah,

3318
02:53:10,960 --> 02:53:11,793
I'm stuck on both fights.
That's all I want to tell people that I 

3319
02:53:14,681 --> 02:53:16,820
wouldn't bet me.
I can bet either.

3320
02:53:17,470 --> 02:53:19,120
They're both very good.
Matchups,

3321
02:53:19,180 --> 02:53:20,710
very good mattress sideboard.

3322
02:53:20,710 --> 02:53:23,110
You have to give her an advantage 
because she's so much bigger and because

3323
02:53:23,111 --> 02:53:26,290
she just doesn't seem to lose.
She's just smashing people.

3324
02:53:26,710 --> 02:53:27,543
She's got really,
really good technique and she's super 

3325
02:53:30,551 --> 02:53:33,970
powerful and she's really big and she's 
got a lot of success.

3326
02:53:34,660 --> 02:53:35,493
And then amanda is,
is without a doubt the hardest hitting 

3327
02:53:37,730 --> 02:53:38,990
bantamweight.
She's fucking cool.

3328
02:53:39,180 --> 02:53:42,150
SMash her man.
She has a gate camp.

3329
02:53:42,250 --> 02:53:46,400
She's long shoulders.
She keeps people in the end,

3330
02:53:46,401 --> 02:53:47,430
the punches.
She'll.

3331
02:53:47,440 --> 02:53:49,020
She's gonna test sideboard.
You know,

3332
02:53:49,140 --> 02:53:49,973
we're going to find out whether or not 
she could hurt her and then we find out 

3333
02:53:52,270 --> 02:53:54,100
if she could hurt her.
This kid get crazy.

3334
02:53:54,370 --> 02:53:55,930
who the fuck knows because Amanda Nunez 
can't.

3335
02:53:57,190 --> 02:53:59,230
If she hurts,
cyborg can get crazy,

3336
02:53:59,231 --> 02:54:02,320
but if she can't,
she hits harder than holly.

3337
02:54:02,321 --> 02:54:03,154
I think in my humble opinion,
I think holly is a great kicker and 

3338
02:54:06,911 --> 02:54:08,110
holly is a,
you know,

3339
02:54:08,500 --> 02:54:09,333
she's really good at movement and she's 
very durable and a holly managed to go 

3340
02:54:12,641 --> 02:54:14,380
the full distance with cyborg,
you know,

3341
02:54:14,470 --> 02:54:15,460
it was a hard fight.

3342
02:54:15,490 --> 02:54:17,110
It was a hard fight and she lost that 
fight.

3343
02:54:17,710 --> 02:54:18,543
Um,
the,

3344
02:54:18,660 --> 02:54:19,493
the,
the difference between holly and Amanda 

3345
02:54:21,670 --> 02:54:22,503
Nunez,
I think it's like one shot power is 

3346
02:54:24,221 --> 02:54:26,840
better for nunez,
but you know,

3347
02:54:26,860 --> 02:54:29,110
holly,
when she fought germane to me,

3348
02:54:29,500 --> 02:54:31,110
she,
when she fought jermaine,

3349
02:54:32,200 --> 02:54:34,160
she knocked her down.
She knocked her down,

3350
02:54:34,180 --> 02:54:35,980
a straight left.
She hurt her,

3351
02:54:36,010 --> 02:54:37,810
she heard her a couple times.
She had kicked her.

3352
02:54:37,960 --> 02:54:38,793
She hit her with a question Mark kick 
and had kicked her and germane to 

3353
02:54:40,991 --> 02:54:42,310
random.
He is really good,

3354
02:54:42,460 --> 02:54:44,770
heavy,
heavy duty moy thai fighter,

3355
02:54:44,800 --> 02:54:48,260
but she didn't want to fight cyborg.
Holly did sidebar.

3356
02:54:48,300 --> 02:54:50,710
Just the biggest and the best in terms 
of like,

3357
02:54:50,770 --> 02:54:51,603
you look at our success ratio.
You look at the way she beats girls 

3358
02:54:54,041 --> 02:54:55,300
down.
She's so powerful,

3359
02:54:55,301 --> 02:54:56,134
man,
that amanda is the toughest fight for 

3360
02:54:58,010 --> 02:54:58,930
our.
This is.

3361
02:54:58,931 --> 02:54:59,501
Yeah,
this is.

3362
02:54:59,501 --> 02:55:02,350
This is.
If you go back to cyborgs,

3363
02:55:02,380 --> 02:55:03,980
fight with gina carano,
gina

3364
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:05,930
carano one point in time was on top of 
her on the ground.

3365
02:55:06,470 --> 02:55:10,040
She didn't sustain it and she lost the 
fight and cyborg eventually smashed her.

3366
02:55:10,220 --> 02:55:12,980
But gina had her moments in that fight,
you know,

3367
02:55:12,981 --> 02:55:13,814
and uh,
don't think gina was ever the one shot 

3368
02:55:15,651 --> 02:55:17,870
cracker that amanda is.
However,

3369
02:55:17,871 --> 02:55:19,790
cyborg is way better than she was back 
then.

3370
02:55:20,690 --> 02:55:22,070
But you know,
so was amanda.

3371
02:55:22,071 --> 02:55:22,850
Amanda,
you know,

3372
02:55:22,850 --> 02:55:24,350
coming off of their cal pennington 
fight,

3373
02:55:24,351 --> 02:55:25,184
you watched that fight.
She dominated raquel pennington and I 

3374
02:55:27,381 --> 02:55:29,540
think we're one of the toughest girls in
the division.

3375
02:55:29,580 --> 02:55:31,860
She's,
she's a hard woman and she,

3376
02:55:31,980 --> 02:55:34,250
she beats a lot of really good fighters 
and she,

3377
02:55:34,280 --> 02:55:35,113
she gave holly holm all she could handle
and then got a split decision loss to 

3378
02:55:39,860 --> 02:55:43,550
holly holm in holly's debut in the ufc 
and she's fucking good.

3379
02:55:43,870 --> 02:55:46,460
And Amanda Nunez handled her.
It was very,

3380
02:55:46,461 --> 02:55:47,240
very impressive.

3381
02:55:47,240 --> 02:55:49,780
Who scary like dismantling.
She's beating her up.

3382
02:55:49,800 --> 02:55:50,633
I was like,
wow.

3383
02:55:50,800 --> 02:55:52,790
like she's on another level now as a 
champion.

3384
02:55:52,791 --> 02:55:55,010
She's gotten even better.
She was always really good.

3385
02:55:55,250 --> 02:55:57,860
she was always really dangerous.
But as a champion,

3386
02:55:57,861 --> 02:56:00,830
she got even better when she beat ronda 
rousey and 48 seconds.

3387
02:56:00,860 --> 02:56:04,070
That was the big coming out party.
Like here we are baby.

3388
02:56:04,630 --> 02:56:06,530
She's,
she's the best bantam weight ever,

3389
02:56:06,860 --> 02:56:07,693
you know,
in terms of her ability to knock girls 

3390
02:56:09,651 --> 02:56:11,630
out.
Like she's the scariest of all time.

3391
02:56:12,110 --> 02:56:13,250
She's the only one.
I mean,

3392
02:56:13,430 --> 02:56:16,220
sidebar can't make 1:35.
Amanda nunez can.

3393
02:56:16,700 --> 02:56:18,590
She's a legit one.
30 five champion,

3394
02:56:18,760 --> 02:56:20,660
you know.
And she's got it down now too.

3395
02:56:20,661 --> 02:56:22,250
She can go five rounds.
She can.

3396
02:56:22,280 --> 02:56:24,740
She can beat the fuck out of you for 
five rounds now.

3397
02:56:25,060 --> 02:56:26,980
Totally the interesting.
Listen,

3398
02:56:26,981 --> 02:56:30,160
merry christmas.
Merry christmas are family.

3399
02:56:30,161 --> 02:56:31,570
You know,
I love you motherfuckers.

3400
02:56:31,780 --> 02:56:34,300
Merry christmas to you,
my friend for christmas,

3401
02:56:34,430 --> 02:56:36,840
my brother this week.
And uh,

3402
02:56:37,070 --> 02:56:38,380
I don't think so.
Not this week,

3403
02:56:38,880 --> 02:56:42,710
but we'll see each other soon for sure.
After the afternoon.

3404
02:56:43,100 --> 02:56:44,830
Alright.
Thank you everybody much.

3405
02:56:44,831 --> 02:56:45,664
Love.
Bye.

3406
02:56:45,710 --> 02:56:47,110
Merry christmas.
Merry christmas.

3407
02:56:47,170 --> 02:56:48,760
Happy new year.
Happy hanukkah.

3408
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:50,650
Happy kwanzaa.
Mary.

3409
02:56:50,651 --> 02:56:51,484
Everybody.
