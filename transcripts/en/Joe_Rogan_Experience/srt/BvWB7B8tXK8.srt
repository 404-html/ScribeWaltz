1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,340
Come on,
let's go.

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:08,911
Boom,
and we're live.

3
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:11,220
David Goggins,
your book is fucking fantastic,

4
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:12,960
man.
This has been my running partner.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,153
The audio version of it has been my 
running partner for the last week was 

6
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:19,110
fucking amazing man,
but I appreciate that.

7
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:19,944
Thank you.
When you guys are doing something very 

8
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:22,560
unusual.
The book is Great.

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,690
I've read,
I've read it like sat down and read,

10
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,820
read,
but the,

11
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:26,703
the audio book is really interesting 
because you and the gentleman who wrote 

12
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:35,910
a with Adam,
Adam Skolnick Skolnik who reads it,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,510
then you come on and talk about things 
in between.

14
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:40,344
So it's more than just the book is the 
book plus is the book plus like a 

15
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:45,730
podcast,
right?

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,951
Yeah.
So hold that.

17
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:47,784
Came to be man as um,
as I was going through this book for 

18
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:52,620
last year,
we would go through change stuff.

19
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:54,040
I have so many stories,
man.

20
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,160
We went through interviews with people,
so many stories.

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,593
He would come back and read it to me,
all my changes and when he read it I'm 

22
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:01,171
like,
man,

23
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:04,380
this guy has a great reading voice.
I love his reading voice.

24
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,590
And I started getting these different 
ideas about doing it,

25
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:07,831
like,
you know,

26
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:08,664
what maybe he can read and I can do my 
podcast thing on the side and he can 

27
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:14,790
like after each chapter in between 
chapters,

28
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,640
make it real interactive type of thing.
And that's kind of how it came to be,

29
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:19,830
man.
At the beginning I got to be honest,

30
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:20,664
the beginning I was like,
who is this motherfucker talk and for 

31
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:24,170
David,
Dave like,

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,580
take you redo this,
why don't you do it?

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,450
Why are you?
But,

34
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,640
but it works.
It really does work.

35
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,150
Like as as it goes on.
And I got also,

36
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,060
it's very,
obviously you and him are good friends.

37
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,013
So when you guys are talking then I 
don't mind him reading for you as much 

38
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:40,890
for some strange reason.

39
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,420
I know it doesn't make any sense.
Well,

40
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:45,000
I wouldn't say we're good friends.
I'm just joking,

41
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:45,990
Adam,
that you can hear it right now.

42
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,320
He became a pain in my fucking ass 
during this process,

43
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:50,790
man,
because you know,

44
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,920
he's just a,
he's a real anal guy.

45
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,783
You know,
he,

46
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,410
he helped out a lot.
You know,

47
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:57,420
I'm a,
I'm a real raw,

48
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,640
sadistic type of mindset and he,
uh,

49
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,280
he helped me put that on paper man.
So I give him a lot of credit for that.

50
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,370
Well,
it,

51
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,210
it comes across the book is outstanding 
and you know,

52
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,120
it's,
it's,

53
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,953
it's more than just sitting,
sitting across from you and you telling 

54
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:13,524
your story is one thing,
but this long detailed history of how 

55
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:23,031
you became to be the person you became.
I think it's very educational for people

56
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,070
because they can realize like,
oh,

57
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:27,630
he wasn't always this guy.

58
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,410
This is what's fucked up about people.
Like you see a guy who's like you,

59
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:32,310
who runs,
I mean,

60
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:34,080
how many ultra marathons did you run in 
a row?

61
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,953
You've got some saying,
I ran 808 weekends in a row to stop and 

62
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:40,950
think about that.
Ladies and gentlemen.

63
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,720
Eight hundreds means eight.
One hundred mile races,

64
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,243
eight weekends in a row.
One hundred mile race will put you out 

65
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:51,160
for fucking six months.
You know,

66
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,790
when you ran eight of them,
eight weekends or it's a fuck.

67
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,070
It's fucking insane accomplishment.
It was nuts.

68
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:56,963
You think about a person like that,
you think of them as a static fully 

69
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:00,400
formed

70
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,290
version,
right?

71
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,313
You don't usually get to see,
and especially someone like you who you 

72
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,610
went into so much depth about your rise 
and fall and rise and fall.

73
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:10,444
It wasn't like a straight linear process
between you getting inspired and then 

74
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:16,030
you becoming this bad motherfucker.
No,

75
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:17,050
it wasn't like,
um,

76
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,400
what's that show called?
Um,

77
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,140
that will smith misplace that,
that black guy who kind of makes it in,

78
00:03:24,141 --> 00:03:25,630
um,
in the financial world,

79
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,060
a pursuit of happiness.
I never saw that.

80
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,170
Yeah,
it's a great movie.

81
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:30,640
It wasn't like pursuit of happiness,
man.

82
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:31,474
Like,
like with a guy struggles and he gets 

83
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:36,070
over it and he makes it.
I fell on my ass.

84
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,150
I thought I've got the top of Mount 
Everest and Mount Everest,

85
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,900
this fucking slide right underneath me,
man.

86
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:41,681
I was like,
God dog.

87
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:44,320
I start from scratch again.
Scratch became my friend.

88
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,510
Literally man.
So you know,

89
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:47,344
that's,
that's how you're putting the book 

90
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,190
match.

91
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,270
Going up,
going down,

92
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:52,840
going up just to real raw version of how
my life was in.

93
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,063
It was so in depth to go back through 
your life with a fine tooth comb that I 

94
00:03:57,731 --> 00:03:59,920
almost got embarrassed.
Even put it out there to people.

95
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,510
Yeah.
That's been our stay up man.

96
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:02,344
Like even me right now to talk to you.
I'm in the car for a fucking hour 

97
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:10,780
getting pumped up because I'm a shy 
introverted leave me alone type of guy.

98
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,250
Like I'm still that motherfucker who is 
six years old,

99
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,443
you know,
at a play who can't say as line because 

100
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,020
I know I'm going to stutter in front of 
five people.

101
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,510
So I walk off the stage.
That's still me.

102
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,670
So everyday I'm fighting that dude.
So people think,

103
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:25,241
oh my God,
man,

104
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:26,710
you got a podcast?
Looks so crazy,

105
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:27,940
so evil.
No,

106
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,280
I'm trying to be locked into Joe.

107
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:35,410
So my mind isn't veer off saying let's 
run out the damn door because people are

108
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:36,244
watching me on the fucking podcast on 
open the damn door and get out of here 

109
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:41,920
man.
So that's the real me.

110
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,800
So I'm not sadistic man.
I'm focused on.

111
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:47,020
We have to do to stay locked into the 
game of life.

112
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,090
And that's where.
And that's why I tell people,

113
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:49,571
man,
I,

114
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:51,310
I go there,
I go there.

115
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,173
That's one of the reasons why this book 
is so good is because you're so honest 

116
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:57,040
about your vulnerabilities and how you 
overcome them.

117
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,460
And for people that see someone who's 
obese,

118
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,403
who's done great things,
you just assume that they're are 

119
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:03,964
different than you,
but then you hear about your 

120
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:09,400
insecurities and your pitfalls and all 
the things that went wrong with you.

121
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,413
And you realize what God dammit,
those the same things to go wrong with 

122
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:12,550
me.

123
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,060
Like maybe I have that inside of me and 
I've just never summoned it.

124
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,220
Right?
And I'll tell you this.

125
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:20,980
I started really realizing that when I 
started overcoming myself,

126
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,560
I started getting around these real 
alpha males,

127
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,540
these hard,
hard men.

128
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,890
And I always put people way above me 
when I was growing up like my God,

129
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:31,990
they had to have a lot more than me to 
get to where they're at.

130
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,573
And a lot of them did.
But once you get around the best of the 

131
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:41,650
best of the best people,
you can kind of start breaking them down

132
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:42,540
and realize that man,
you,

133
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,920
you're just as fucked up as me like,
like we all have.

134
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,710
But all you did was you hit it better.
Your,

135
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,540
your,
your upbringing,

136
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,640
your mom and dad,
your society,

137
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:55,090
the way you were raised,
it hit it better than that mind.

138
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,230
You weren't the only black kid or there 
was like five in

139
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,330
a school,
you know,

140
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,350
I can't hide going through buds.
I was the only black you can't hide.

141
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,783
But I started realizing just because I 
looked different than you allow you my 

142
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:08,234
first can hard either.
So it started giving me courage to 

143
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:11,990
watching people that were all have a 
story.

144
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:14,210
We all have a jacked up life in one way 
or another.

145
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,490
Some of us don't have the guts to talk 
about it though.

146
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,710
And that's where I found the guts to 
talk about mine.

147
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,783
Well,
there's some this purity in physical 

148
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:22,340
pursuits,
right?

149
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,650
Because it doesn't matter what your 
social status is.

150
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:27,110
It doesn't matter how people perceive 
you.

151
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:27,680
When,
uh,

152
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,560
when it comes down to how long can you 
stay in that pool,

153
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:32,480
when it comes down to how far can you 
run,

154
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,443
when it comes down to how much can you 
push yourself past the part where you 

155
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,110
want to quit or how far can you keep 
going?

156
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,220
There's a purity in that that it did 
dissolve social order,

157
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:46,100
all that bullshit.
All the what people think about you goes

158
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:47,050
out the window.
It's what?

159
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,240
Who are you right now?
Right for you right now?

160
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,470
That's a true statement,
man,

161
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,363
and I look at it as psychological 
warfare and that's where I started 

162
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:57,224
learning that.
That life is one big psychological 

163
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:01,910
warfare that you play on yourself.
You play on yourself,

164
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:04,490
man.
The most important conversation ever had

165
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,750
is with myself and that Shit I'll tell 
him myself was so fucked up.

166
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,613
It was so wrong.
It was so misguided and other people 

167
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,580
start to write that dialogue for you.
Also,

168
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,090
it starts to be what you say to yourself
every single day,

169
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,970
and I started creating a whole nother 
warfare.

170
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,220
A whole nother battle started becoming 
and I was like,

171
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:22,941
oh,
hang on a second.

172
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:25,580
Goggins,
you have these tools,

173
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,870
do you have these tools?

174
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,703
Your life was basically the perfect,
the perfect grounds for training for 

175
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:34,640
where you need to go in your life,
all the beatings,

176
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:36,980
all the other bullying,
all that you know,

177
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:39,800
you going through a learning disability,
all the struggles.

178
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,903
It was an absolute perfect training 
ground for you to go to where you need 

179
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:44,234
to go,
and that's how I started looking at my 

180
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:47,900
life versus woe is me.
Poopy pants.

181
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,090
Kick a rock down the street mentality.
It was,

182
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,940
no,
God just hooked you right the fuck up.

183
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,790
He hooked you.
Write up man with the perfect place.

184
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,310
You were training for the first 18,
19,

185
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,990
20.
So you were training for this stuff.

186
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:02,120
Man,
you have the advantage of everybody else

187
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,360
versus my God,
they're so above me.

188
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,080
They came from a great family.
Mom and dad love them.

189
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,910
They didn't have learned.
Then they started.

190
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:11,744
They didn't struggle.

191
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,801
Nah,
man,

192
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:15,410
you're struggle is what made you who you
are now.

193
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,110
So I started flipping this into a whole 
different.

194
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:20,900
I started being a master of what I was 
scared of.

195
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:21,734
I was scared of my mind and I became a 
literally a master of that mind and 

196
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:29,210
that's what now from now on,
it sets me apart from most people.

197
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,340
I started diving into that,
well,

198
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:32,174
that is a big part of the stories when 
you go over your childhood and you know 

199
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,213
your abusive father and then having this
great guy that was going to become your 

200
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:44,270
step dad and then he gets murdered.
It's like right when you're about to get

201
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:46,100
out of it.
Everything looks good.

202
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,930
Boom.
Then he gets murdered.

203
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:48,764
It's like these things really did sort 
of set you up to start from scratch 

204
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:53,540
again and just go,
okay,

205
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,010
Roger,
that we start from scratch and now

206
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,843
you have that attitude.
You developed it through all of these 

207
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,970
horrible personal experiences,
all the trials and tribulations,

208
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:03,804
all the evil shit that people try to do 
to you that sort of set you up to be 

209
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:10,260
able to deal in a way that a lot of 
people can't.

210
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,450
Well,

211
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,283
well,
I used to look at my life from a 

212
00:09:13,031 --> 00:09:17,470
different vantage point and when you're.
When you're in all the muck and you just

213
00:09:17,471 --> 00:09:20,080
walk in and muck and walk in and muck 
and walk in and Muck,

214
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,083
you don't see that.
If you look off to the fucking left of 

215
00:09:24,341 --> 00:09:25,570
the muck,
there's a sidewalk,

216
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:27,220
brother.
Get off,

217
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,140
get off of it.
You have your head down.

218
00:09:29,141 --> 00:09:31,680
Looking at this book,
once I saw the sidewalk,

219
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,510
the sidewalk,
I got a little break and I got different

220
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:37,480
vantage point and then from the sidewalk
I found a cliff.

221
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,343
Then I found a mountain.
I got way up high on top of my life and 

222
00:09:39,851 --> 00:09:41,170
look back down on it and said,
okay,

223
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,680
I gotta figure this out man.
I'm not going anywhere.

224
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,320
I'm going to lie.
I'm starting.

225
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,990
So when you have a messed up foundation,
I started lying about everything.

226
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,823
I wanted people to like me.
I wanted to be accepted in some society 

227
00:09:53,711 --> 00:09:55,600
of life,
some social society,

228
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,070
and I said,
man,

229
00:09:57,071 --> 00:09:58,940
this isn't the right way.
I messed up here.

230
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:00,370
I messed up here and messed up 
everywhere.

231
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,430
And so I realized the worst thing that 
happened to me,

232
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,353
I lost myself.
I never had myself and ever found 

233
00:10:05,921 --> 00:10:07,720
myself.
I had no self esteem,

234
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,010
so I knew through working out and 
through learning God,

235
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,510
it took a lot for me to learn.
Also,

236
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,733
I started finding self esteem.
Once I found that that's when doors 

237
00:10:17,411 --> 00:10:18,370
started opening up.
I started.

238
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,300
I stopped caring about people that what 
they thought being judged.

239
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,350
Wow,
if I say this,

240
00:10:23,351 --> 00:10:25,420
if I started right now or you can make 
fun of me,

241
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,990
I stopped caring about that and that's 
my life started really changing for me.

242
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,893
Slowly but surely that that's such an 
important point where you're talking 

243
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:33,914
about the working out because a lot of 
people when they think about working 

244
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:36,764
out,
they're thinking of it as being a 

245
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:38,010
physical thing.
Right?

246
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,800
No,

247
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,660
no.
I did it for mental.

248
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,340
Yeah.
People are saying my God like,

249
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:43,450
no,
don't,

250
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,700
don't look at it like I didn't care 
about losing weight.

251
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,470
I didn't care about being the fastest 
person.

252
00:10:47,471 --> 00:10:49,060
I came out.
I wasn't making the Olympics.

253
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:51,550
I won't go into pros.
I could barely read and write.

254
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,550
When I was a junior in high school,
I wasn't going anywhere.

255
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,990
I saw working out as a way for me to 
build calluses on my mind.

256
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,840
I had a callous over the victim's 
mentality,

257
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,350
so I watched these movies.
I,

258
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,213
you know,
I talked about rocky last time I was 

259
00:11:05,711 --> 00:11:06,544
down here.
I always equated training to mental 

260
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:13,360
toughening,
like it was a brutal.

261
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:15,460
People waking up early and do it.
All these things,

262
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:16,600
they look,
it looked horrible.

263
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,471
I was like,
wow man,

264
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:19,570
I got started doing that.
Not to get better,

265
00:11:19,571 --> 00:11:22,270
bigger and stronger,
but that is what's going to build me.

266
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,990
That looks uncomfortable,
that looks brutal and getting up early.

267
00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:26,824
I don't want to do that.
So maybe this long list of things I 

268
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:32,410
don't want to do.
And through that I found myself,

269
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,150
I started like,
I'm like,

270
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,010
you guys aren't doing this shit in high 
school,

271
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,980
you guys are getting up at 5:00
in the morning running over here in this

272
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:39,814
golf course.
So I started seeing myself very 

273
00:11:41,681 --> 00:11:43,630
differently than the average human 
being.

274
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,740
I was like,
hold on a second.

275
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,323
I have some they don't have.
And that's when I started to develop 

276
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:53,671
these things through working out.
It was this great never ending ethic and

277
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:56,620
through work ethic are developed self 
esteem.

278
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,390
Now,

279
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,223
is this something that you learned?
Is this something you learn yourself 

280
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:01,794
from,
from exercise yourself or is it 

281
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:07,260
something you read or heard about?
Like what made you equate this,

282
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:10,590
doing this and doing these difficult 
things physically to mental toughness to

283
00:12:10,591 --> 00:12:11,424
being this is the discipline that you 
need in order to get your life out of 

284
00:12:13,891 --> 00:12:14,760
the situation you're in.

285
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,230
So I never read anything.
You know,

286
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,440
I,
I could barely read,

287
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:19,570
you know,
so I wasn't reading back then.

288
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,003
I just saw,
I watched a lot of movies and I was 

289
00:12:23,231 --> 00:12:24,064
really big individualization and I 
always equated working out to struggle 

290
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,040
and I struggled my whole life,
but I ran from it.

291
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,780
So I started realizing,
man,

292
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:35,614
I got to start facing the struggle and I
got to be mentally strong for the 

293
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:38,614
struggle.
So that's why I started coming up with 

294
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:43,480
like I'm training for life mentally.
I'm training for life.

295
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:44,314
I'm not training for like to lift 400 
pounds and I found out on my own pretty 

296
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:51,100
much is that through this,
through through discipline,

297
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:54,760
through self discipline,
through repetition to tons of repetition

298
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:56,800
of the same thing that you don't want to
do it.

299
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:57,790
That's the.
That's the key thing.

300
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,490
Through repetition of things you don't 
want to do.

301
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:01,683
You develop mental,
like like an armor for your mind starts 

302
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:06,730
to armor your mind cut,
and I was like,

303
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:08,170
okay,
we suffer.

304
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,950
We suffer every day for what we do.
We do stuff that sucks every day.

305
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:12,784
So then when the suck stuff comes,
you're ready for it and that's how it 

306
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:16,914
started coming up.
I just started being very uncomfortable 

307
00:13:18,261 --> 00:13:19,900
and now I'm a second.
Just a way of life.

308
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,690
It's a crazy thing to figure out though.

309
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,583
It's like the.
You figured it out and you didn't just 

310
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:26,110
figured it out.
You embraced it.

311
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:28,480
Like when you were talking about your 
senior year of high school,

312
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:31,000
when you're talking about your mere 
being,

313
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:34,060
your accountability mirror,
like you had a radical shift,

314
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:39,280
like you just decided to not be a 
fucking loser and to start tightening up

315
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:41,210
and start holding yourself accountable 
and,

316
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,030
and get ready for things.

317
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,510
So I had this my whole life.
I don't know if people believe in God or

318
00:13:47,511 --> 00:13:48,890
what.
I don't care what you believe in.

319
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,140
There's been this unrelenting voice in 
my head.

320
00:13:51,141 --> 00:13:51,974
We all have this voice is the right or 
wrong voice and a lot of times that 

321
00:13:55,941 --> 00:14:00,770
voice guides us into comfort and my 
voice got it mean to comfort a lot.

322
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,950
But I had this other voice I heard my 
whole life saying,

323
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:05,210
hey motherfucker,
what are you doing?

324
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,730
No Man,
we gotta go over here.

325
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,023
We have go over here to,
to that rockpile over in the fucking 

326
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:14,630
corner where nobody's at that.
That's where victories at.

327
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,003
We're over in that corner.
So this voice was giving me all these 

328
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:20,930
answers.
Not I wasn't real smart kid growing up,

329
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:21,764
but I had this crazy voice in my head 
saying over there is where the fucking 

330
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:26,444
answers are and I will listen to it 
because over there was pain over there 

331
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:30,434
with me looking in the mirror over there
was me being accountable for all these 

332
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:33,404
things.
I went through my life even though 

333
00:14:34,131 --> 00:14:34,964
people put 'em on me,
it's not mine to own and I didn't want 

334
00:14:37,191 --> 00:14:38,024
to go over there by myself,
but I had to in his voice was guiding 

335
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,200
me.
There is God,

336
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:44,390
whatever you want to call it,
but that's what.

337
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,380
That's what it was in me.

338
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,510
It does just what you.
When you separate yourself from your ego

339
00:14:49,511 --> 00:14:52,370
and what you were,
your insecurities and all you like.

340
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,383
If you were giving yourself advice,
you would say that's what the thing is 

341
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:57,224
to do.
So do you think that's what it was like 

342
00:14:58,221 --> 00:14:59,770
your subconscious or.
Oh,

343
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,110
you stripped away from all the bullshit 
when he couldn't lie to yourself because

344
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,220
it's a voice in your head.

345
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,150
Exactly it.
That's exactly it because it knew.

346
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,043
It knew I was a character.
I was trying to find myself through her 

347
00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:11,794
character.
I was making different hairstyles and 

348
00:15:13,031 --> 00:15:16,660
sagging my pants and I was off.
I was off,

349
00:15:16,661 --> 00:15:17,494
man.
I was,

350
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,890
I was a clown,
I was a clown and I was like,

351
00:15:20,891 --> 00:15:21,724
this is not,
this is not what you're supposed to be 

352
00:15:23,201 --> 00:15:24,034
in life,
man.

353
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,943
And it's ugly when you look in that 
dirty mirror and you're trying to do a 

354
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:29,470
new hairstyle to go to school.
You know,

355
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,710
I had the hairstyle one time where I 
shaved the top of my head.

356
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,570
Not old men.
Had the hair,

357
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,320
like leaving their.
Yeah.

358
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,473
So I went to school with hair on the 
side of my head and in my back and I 

359
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,360
shaved the whole top of my head.
I just,

360
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,910
I went to school like that,
you know,

361
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:49,160
and then I'd had like with what did the 
kids say I want that.

362
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,120
I don't remember what it said,
but I was just a funny dude,

363
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,530
you know.
So that was my thing.

364
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,813
I was the funny dude that came into 
school like criss cross came out and I 

365
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,800
was in high school so my pants are 
backwards.

366
00:15:59,801 --> 00:16:02,920
That's my pants backwards,
sag down past my ass,

367
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:03,754
crack short term backwards with a 
toothbrush in my mouth with the reverse 

368
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:08,374
part.
Reverse part is your head is shaved and 

369
00:16:10,121 --> 00:16:10,954
you have some hair on top.
Just a little piece of hair versus like 

370
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:17,470
a like a part two here.
The part was on a bald head,

371
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,020
so it was just I,
I,

372
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:20,973
I,
I was sitting at home instead of 

373
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:22,744
studying,
I would think about what can I do to 

374
00:16:24,701 --> 00:16:29,701
impress the motherfucker at school,
why that became my life and that is,

375
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,753
is a long road to hoe to get to the guy 
who says now you never smile on any 

376
00:16:34,571 --> 00:16:35,110
podcasts.

377
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,060
Look so serious.
I look at that shit.

378
00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:37,894
I'm like,
you mother fuckers have no idea who I 

379
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:40,780
am.
Who,

380
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,480
who,
where I've come from to get here today.

381
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,523
You could have probably been an 
entertainer like you probably because 

382
00:16:46,931 --> 00:16:48,730
you were doing all that kind of share 
some jokes.

383
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,340
Joe,
you do.

384
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,310
So what people read in this book can 
hurt me.

385
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,260
It's a sad story.
It's a horrible story.

386
00:16:56,261 --> 00:16:58,540
It's a tragic story.
It's a story that made me who I am day,

387
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,930
but you have to learn to laugh at 
yourself too once you,

388
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,110
once you go through that shit I now.
So there's a lot of parts in there was a

389
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,350
of media gets a lot of white people,
you know,

390
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:12,850
and I have a routine that I won't do,
so people who hire me to speak,

391
00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:14,970
I'm not going to do the routine.
I often do it.

392
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,580
Sometimes I think about it.
I was at 36 black guy to go through seal

393
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:19,750
training.
Okay.

394
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:20,973
Out of how many people out of probably 
looking at probably 1112 to make it 

395
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:28,330
through probably 13,000
seals.

396
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:31,050
I'll probably the 36,
36 black.

397
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,830
I'd make it through and over since like 
the,

398
00:17:32,831 --> 00:17:33,970
like the 19 forties,
you know,

399
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,920
you're looking at almost 70 years.
Wow.

400
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,611
Yeah.
So you know,

401
00:17:36,611 --> 00:17:37,060
you know,
you know,

402
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,220
do the math on that.
So there's not a lot of black guys.

403
00:17:39,221 --> 00:17:42,670
And so I take that and then make a nice 
comedy skit out of that Shit.

404
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:43,920
You know,
like,

405
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,753
like,
like the first time they tied me up and 

406
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,050
threw me.
It's called drown proofing.

407
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,830
So I'm negative.
Boring as you know.

408
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,740
Me Too.
Oh,

409
00:17:50,741 --> 00:17:53,250
I related to that big time.
When you talk about White Boys,

410
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:54,084
man,
there's negative boy you said like a 

411
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,650
rock a rock.

412
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,483
And that's hard.
So matching the him getting your hands 

413
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,243
and feet.
Tanya asked ass up for throwing the 

414
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:01,110
fucking water.
Say Swim.

415
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,753
Ah,
it was like throwing a cat in the water 

416
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:06,960
with fucking brick on them.
So I was just losing my fucking mind.

417
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,780
So if somebody had to get over,
you know,

418
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:10,121
and I,
and I,

419
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:13,140
and I found humor.
I found humor in my suffering.

420
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,550
I was like,
motherfucker,

421
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,310
what are you doing out here?
Goggins like this is crazy.

422
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:18,144
Like you're,
you're literally trying to reinvent the 

423
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:22,500
wheel.
But I was trying to reinvent my mind.

424
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,083
I was trying to reinvent my mind and I 
used every single tactic possible to do 

425
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:29,370
that.
I didn't want to live,

426
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,353
you know,
live in this world where I was a fake 

427
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:34,860
human being anymore.
And I was tired of blaming everybody for

428
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:36,750
where I was at.
My Dad beat me.

429
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,411
This happened.
I mean,

430
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:38,900
my dad ran prostitutes.
Man.

431
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,610
My Dad literally snatched the soul out 
of my mom,

432
00:18:41,611 --> 00:18:42,444
like my mom is still battling.
Like after my mom left my dad and this 

433
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:46,494
one I'll talk about in the book,
she got married three times for a total 

434
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:51,410
of six months,
you know,

435
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,180
I don't go there and I'm going to talk 
about the guy she married.

436
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,430
So this woman was,
she's beautiful.

437
00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:57,720
She's,
she's so smart.

438
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:58,554
All this stuff,
man.

439
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,603
This guy literally stripped her soul 
away as a young kid watching it and I 

440
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:06,900
had no soul to begin with in my,
in my brother,

441
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:08,850
he has a story that,
that he could write eight books,

442
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,050
you know,
my,

443
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,300
my dad just came through in this,
washed this all clean,

444
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,430
so to,
to,

445
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,160
to come around.
He died about four years ago.

446
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,630
Four or five years.
You're not for sure.

447
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,370
I didn't go to the funeral,
but I forgave him.

448
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,400
So I saw my dad through an eight year 
old's eyes.

449
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,253
So we left when I was eight and then at 
22 I went back to see him through a 

450
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:30,120
grown man's eyes and he was the same 
person I remembered,

451
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,100
but I had to.
You can't live with hate,

452
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,310
you cannot move forward.
As much as that guy tried to ruin all of

453
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:39,780
our lives,
that's where I came from.

454
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,330
I did.
I'd have figured out the origin of where

455
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:45,060
I started from.
So when I was going back through my life

456
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:47,160
trying to fix who I am,
the fucked up person,

457
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:47,994
I was like,
if your knee hurts is usually not your 

458
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:53,400
fucking knee.
That's hurting is something else man.

459
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,250
Like it could be a tight quad,
it could be the right leg,

460
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,213
the left leg.
You got found out the origin of where 

461
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:01,440
all this shit began and it was him.

462
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,180
So I had to go back to where you know,
my,

463
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,043
my roots in,
in the origin of all this happened in 

464
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:08,010
his heart to do that.
Did you make peace with them?

465
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,053
I'm a big piece with.
So we didn't have a peaceful 

466
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:11,940
conversation.
We,

467
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:12,400
you know,
we,

468
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,030
we,
we left very granual.

469
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,880
He's a,
he's a,

470
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,910
he's a vicious man.
He wasn't vicious man.

471
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,833
I mean mid evil motherfucker.
So I had become a medieval motherfucker 

472
00:20:23,161 --> 00:20:23,994
that time.
I was 22 when I was a big boy and so I 

473
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:28,710
was no longer the guy who was afraid it 
was now like,

474
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:30,720
Hey,
I want to kill you type of shit.

475
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,973
And we were sitting at Denny's after an 
all night skate or whatever the hell he 

476
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:40,240
owned bars and skating rinks like that.
And so we were sitting down and we kinda

477
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,093
got into it and I was kind of left and.
But I had to make peace with it in 

478
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:45,520
myself.
I,

479
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,500
I could not hold onto that.
Hake is,

480
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:47,980
hold on to that.

481
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,813
Hate was half the reason why I kept 
falling into the same pattern of 

482
00:20:51,371 --> 00:20:52,204
failing.
I had to get out and start dumping off 

483
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:58,030
some baggage.
Had to start figuring out me through him

484
00:20:58,031 --> 00:21:02,170
and that's all he was there for.
He was the origin of figure him out,

485
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,143
figure out why he was so evil to my mom,
to me and my brother and I to start 

486
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:07,234
studying him.
Like a lot of people have situations 

487
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:12,460
where someone does something and we all 
attack that person,

488
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:13,540
like,
like on the media,

489
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,510
if someone does something wrong,
everybody now is fucking perfect.

490
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,480
And we now judged this guy.
I don't judge them,

491
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,930
I don't judge anybody.
What I do is I started studying them.

492
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,440
Why did they do that?
Not in a judging way.

493
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,690
I want to learn from you.
And what'd you get out of your dad?

494
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,350
I got to.

495
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,700
He was,
he grew up rough.

496
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,860
He had,
he was very insecure,

497
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:37,861
had a lot of kids and his insecurities 
just trickled over on to us.

498
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,790
So yeah,
he jacked us up real good.

499
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:46,060
But he never fixed himself.
So if you never fix yourself,

500
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,260
the next person in line is going to get 
the wrap and we're next in line,

501
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,550
you know,
his,

502
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:55,070
his first wife killed herself or 
whatever happened and you know,

503
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:55,923
got burned up in a house with some 
craziness and his last stuff that goes 

504
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:58,984
on there that I didn't put in the book 
because I don't feel like going to 

505
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:01,840
court,
you know.

506
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,710
But um,
yeah,

507
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,380
this,
uh,

508
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,350
it was,
it was last have,

509
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,513
you know,
one of the great parts about this book 

510
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,003
is that you,
you detail exactly what was going 

511
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:13,144
through your mind in terms of like your 
weaknesses and how you had failed and 

512
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,423
then you,
it's not just one time like you do the 

513
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:23,014
thing in high school where you get your 
shit together and then you joined the 

514
00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:29,740
military and then you wind up getting 
fat again.

515
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,903
And then when you go you and you have to
lose what does 106 pounds in three 

516
00:22:33,941 --> 00:22:37,320
months to two to qualify for seal 
training.

517
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:38,154
Seal training.
Yup.

518
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,060
That's insane.
Yeah.

519
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,770
Because we,
I realized at that time,

520
00:22:41,771 --> 00:22:42,604
once again I failed again.
I thought so when you're talking about 

521
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,620
is I took this as baptists,
you know,

522
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,370
I didn't know how to read and write 
pretty much in high school.

523
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:49,204
I was like a fourth grade reading level 
after that test a few times and I 

524
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:57,340
finally passed it and when I passed it 
actually drove my car to the,

525
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,960
to the Dag gone,
um,

526
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:02,410
airport and watch planes take off 
because I was like,

527
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,960
I'm going to be on one of those planes 
one day going to air force bootcamp.

528
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,000
So I,
I never,

529
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,250
I always fixed the things on the 
surface.

530
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,150
So if I couldn't read and write,
learn to read and write,

531
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,303
I,
I would always fix these things on a 

532
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:15,604
surface level.
And so whenever something hard was like 

533
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,763
raised ugly head,
I didn't have any kind of tools to 

534
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:23,284
handle it.
I mean I thought I fixed this already 

535
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:25,990
man.
But no,

536
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,930
I didn't go deep into the dungeon of my 
soul to say,

537
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:30,940
okay,
what is making you a quitter?

538
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,810
What is making you a weak man?
We're just making you afraid.

539
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,513
And so that's why I kept on quitting and
going back to start or not knowing how 

540
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:41,464
to get through hard times.
And that's why I was telling people I'm 

541
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:46,160
not a theorist.
I just studied

542
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,610
like,
you know,

543
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,443
I didn't study a fucking book.
I literally put myself in a fire 

544
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,710
repeatedly like a sword.
You put a sword in a fire repeatedly,

545
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,180
repeatedly.
If you keep on doing that,

546
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:58,640
you're going to get an ice sword and you
keep on beating it.

547
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,250
You've got to beat the shit out of it 
and that's what I am.

548
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,010
I became that much.
I said,

549
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:05,480
okay,
we can't quit.

550
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,300
We got to figure out why you are this 
pussy.

551
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,540
Why are you this pussy man?
What is wrong with you?

552
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:12,374
What's going on here?
So I kept on putting a sore back in the 

553
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:15,044
deck on fire and I just beat it harder 
and I beat it harder before I knew I 

554
00:24:19,101 --> 00:24:22,520
started realizing hmm,
alright ma'am.

555
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,880
The brain is starting to get hard to 
brain is starting to get hard.

556
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,640
I'm no longer a theorist.
I'm now a practitioner.

557
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,773
I put it in here.
We'll add a second while I was sitting 

558
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:37,760
here because you can't dissect anything 
in a normal environment.

559
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,310
You can't dissect anything is 72 degree 
weather.

560
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:44,060
You must put it in the fucking freezer 
and freeze the fuck out of it,

561
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,090
and then you dissect it.
That sector,

562
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,380
when it's miserable,
dissect the brain.

563
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,900
We're all thinking about,
I need to get outta here,

564
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:51,734
man.
I want to get out of the fucking 

565
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:55,280
freezer.
Opened the door and he said,

566
00:24:55,281 --> 00:24:57,020
no,
five more seconds,

567
00:24:57,021 --> 00:24:57,854
man.
Five more seconds in the freezer and 

568
00:24:59,551 --> 00:25:00,384
nationally you start to pick that brain 
apart and that's where all this stuff 

569
00:25:02,871 --> 00:25:03,704
did to me.
I kept on putting myself back into the 

570
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:06,734
freezer or the fire in beaten the shit 
out of myself mentally and physically 

571
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,990
before I knew it.
This is what happened.

572
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,453
Wow.

573
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,830
You said it's an interesting way to self
teach.

574
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,640
Yes,
like most people that you know,

575
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,120
you talk to that a discipline,
they,

576
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,073
you know,
they have something that they read that 

577
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,403
inspired them.
They have certain people that they look 

578
00:25:32,381 --> 00:25:33,214
up to.
There's certain coaches that taught 

579
00:25:35,471 --> 00:25:36,304
them.
There's certain important moments in 

580
00:25:37,511 --> 00:25:41,660
their life,
but for you it's a system of failure and

581
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,150
and reflection and then rebooting.
That's it.

582
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,450
Pete.
It failure

583
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,780
and people think a lot of times 
department that I'm angry.

584
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,370
Oh my God,
you sound so angry.

585
00:25:51,371 --> 00:25:52,600
You customer much.
I'm a guy.

586
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:53,440
Why?
Customer much?

587
00:25:53,441 --> 00:25:56,140
Why you still crazy?
If you read my book,

588
00:25:56,141 --> 00:25:58,660
I cannot explain my life by saying,
hey,

589
00:25:58,661 --> 00:26:01,240
it was a merry fucking Christmas man.
No,

590
00:26:01,241 --> 00:26:02,790
it wasn't.
I want you.

591
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:06,490
I want you to go there with me.
I'm taking you there with me.

592
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,660
I'm a storyteller.
I want to take your ass down.

593
00:26:10,661 --> 00:26:12,610
Paradise.
We are so the house.

594
00:26:12,611 --> 00:26:14,980
I lived in Buffalo,
New York that got my ass beat every day.

595
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,083
Funny.
We lived on Paradise Road and it was 

596
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:23,110
anything but fucking paradise.
So I want you to go there with me.

597
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:25,480
You want to learn from me?
Let me take your ass home.

598
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:28,420
Let me take you there.
So that's the whole thing about it,

599
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:32,290
man.
We were scared to dive into our lives.

600
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,260
What made us who we are to beautiful 
people,

601
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,990
that we are.
We all jacked up and so many ways.

602
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,320
That's the beauty of us.
That's the beauty of me.

603
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,190
I'm jacked up,
but I figured

604
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,680
out my own little process and how to get
on jacked up and how to.

605
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,290
I'm not going to get the same,
you know?

606
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,860
I'm not gonna get the same way you're 
going to get there.

607
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,630
You may get there by going point a to 
point B.

608
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,160
I'm going to get to point c to d to eat 
it,

609
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,690
but I want to be there the same way.
You are just a little harder.

610
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,630
That's how I trained my brain,
so it was just different.

611
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,070
It was different.
Different thinker.

612
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,743
When you stop and think about all the 
different times that you did have to 

613
00:27:07,411 --> 00:27:12,411
reboot and how you found like new goals 
and you found new inspiration,

614
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:13,584
you fired up a new discipline and he 
became stronger and harder and you've 

615
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:21,090
got one of the things that people always
look for in life.

616
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,160
They look for a point where they can 
rest.

617
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,390
I'm going to retire.
People love.

618
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,430
They love that expression.
The Golden.

619
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:33,230
I love that expression.
They love the.

620
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,270
They love the idea of a struggle as long
as it ends,

621
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,163
and then when it ends,
you're going to have a nice comfortable 

622
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:39,450
spot.
It must.

623
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:42,930
It must end.
Relax,

624
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,190
man.
You've done so much.

625
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,710
You've really done so much,
but this.

626
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,820
The idea of reaching this golden year 
is,

627
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,630
is it's a very flawed idea because it's 
an idea that you're gonna,

628
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,583
you're gonna work hard,
but then you're going to reach the 

629
00:27:57,121 --> 00:27:57,954
finish line,
but there's no finish line doesn't 

630
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:01,890
exist.
That's the scary thing about life,

631
00:28:01,891 --> 00:28:03,540
my friend.
That is a scary thing,

632
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,430
right?
And that's what fatigues me.

633
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,331
People go,
man,

634
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:09,960
why don't you ever smile?
There's no fucking in my friend.

635
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,190
There's no end.
There's no end.

636
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,350
I know that you're,
you're,

637
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,380
you're going to meet campaigns after 
this and listen please.

638
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,273
If you guys run,
put a number of the miles that you're 

639
00:28:22,771 --> 00:28:25,290
going to run and leave it.
Do not say,

640
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:29,760
let's see both died because that's a 
hard man.

641
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,060
He is a hard man.
When Hans is a hard man,

642
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,800
he will run until you die or he dies.
Man.

643
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,870
Dude,
he doesn't.

644
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,670
He does those two forties.
He does ultra.

645
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,990
He's,
he's a sick fuck.

646
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,430
They see those are the guys I'm looking 
for.

647
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,420
Yeah,
that's a scary.

648
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,640
Do you want the two of you guys?
You need to pick a number.

649
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,590
I think you guys are going to run 35 
miles.

650
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,070
So we're going to do good.
Five's a good number.

651
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,930
We've been texting back and forth trying
to make it,

652
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:52,764
you know,
trying to make it sensible so we don't 

653
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:54,984
go off the chain because if one of you 
motherfuckers wakes up and has a good 

654
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:59,520
strong espresso knows fuck it.

655
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,660
Let's do 300.
It's going to be on be a long day man.

656
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,820
Oh is it?
Yeah.

657
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:06,723
You know,
this new race that they're doing where 

658
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:11,130
they're um,
you run for one hour,

659
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:12,323
you run like as many and then you have 
like a bell rings and then you sit down 

660
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:17,640
for a little bit.
You know what I mean?

661
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:21,420
Like there's like a four point one,
seven mile thing.

662
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,500
Yup.
Is that sick?

663
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:23,334
Fuck.
What was the guy's name that created 

664
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:26,160
that?
That guided the Barkley Marathon?

665
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,920
Yes.
Yeah,

666
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,360
this crazy fuck.
Last.

667
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:33,210
So he had people running for days and 
days and days.

668
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,160
He invited me out there for this race.
Yeah.

669
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,143
I actually got into the Barkley last 
year but couldn't do it because the 

670
00:29:38,131 --> 00:29:40,410
book.
So I'm supposed to do it this year.

671
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,130
But now you know,
we'll see you again

672
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,060
how the schedule goes.
But yeah,

673
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:45,190
that that's a sick,
sick man.

674
00:29:45,191 --> 00:29:47,620
I've done a couple of his races.
Like he has one called strolling.

675
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:51,340
Jim.
I actually won that one in 2016 but he's

676
00:29:51,341 --> 00:29:52,360
a,
he's a sick man.

677
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:53,194
Is a stroll.
Strolling Jim race is probably easiest 

678
00:29:55,391 --> 00:29:56,224
race.
It's like it's like through the back 

679
00:29:56,891 --> 00:30:00,130
country of Tennessee is a 41 mile race 
on the road.

680
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,993
It's one of the first ultra marathons 
out there ever and my mom lives in 

681
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:05,104
Nashville so it's like an hour drive.
I went up there and it was like when my 

682
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:08,404
first race back after me being off sick 
and jacked up for so long and I got 

683
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:13,560
lucky,
had a good race and I happen to want to,

684
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,394
you know,
you were talking about so last muscle 

685
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,503
yet,
although we have this thing now that 

686
00:30:17,471 --> 00:30:19,090
we've got,
what does that call the pro pro,

687
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:19,360
so.

688
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,290
Right,
so right.

689
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:21,124
Have you ever used one,
but also I saw it in there that that 

690
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:26,430
little black contraction,
hard plastic thing,

691
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,670
phenomenal is evil man.
It's good.

692
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,410
It's amazing.
I started getting tightness in that when

693
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:33,244
I was running a lot,
like I'd never gotten tightness in that 

694
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:37,570
area before.
It seems like that's a running thing,

695
00:30:37,571 --> 00:30:38,404
right?
It's a running thing and also a very 

696
00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:40,630
stressed thing,
you know,

697
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,200
if you're a real stressed out man,
like for me,

698
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,570
I can talk about the origin were worth 
thing.

699
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,590
Start.
My body was so wrapped tight,

700
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,970
I didn't know where to start.
So I started with the PSOAS muscle,

701
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:52,804
so that's a real good spot with the 
problem with these races is the problem 

702
00:30:56,081 --> 00:30:58,620
with people like you.
That's the problem with these races,

703
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,950
like if you get you and another you 
right.

704
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,200
And they're in there together.

705
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,930
Like you motherfuckers are going to kill
each other so long day.

706
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,920
It's a long day.
So as long as this a lot.

707
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,320
Because if they're doing a last man 
standing type of deal,

708
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:12,010
right?
Yeah.

709
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,980
Like the first person to quit.
Uh,

710
00:31:13,981 --> 00:31:15,940
it's a,
it's a real long day man.

711
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,370
I mean I've been up,
I got a couple of weeks under my belt,

712
00:31:18,371 --> 00:31:19,204
man.
I know how to feel for her and 30 hours 

713
00:31:19,981 --> 00:31:21,040
a move.
Yeah.

714
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:21,933
And I know how to self motivate a lot of
motherfuckers don't know how to self 

715
00:31:24,141 --> 00:31:24,974
motivate man.
Like we'd like to put the headphones on 

716
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,990
like before the big game and listen to 
the music.

717
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:29,883
Yeah.
What the fuck did you do when the 

718
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:32,950
headphones come off,
Bro?

719
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,710
It's you and your mind,
right?

720
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,620
I know how to do that.
That's the hard part member.

721
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,280
Listen to music when you run.
Never,

722
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:42,590
never told you Jamie's cheap as that 
video I got.

723
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,093
But I uh,
talks about like running with music and 

724
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,700
know what did you say?
I find it,

725
00:31:48,701 --> 00:31:51,160
find the video will play it.
I might not be able to play it.

726
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:54,160
We get somebody else's content.
I actually,

727
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:57,400
um,
but I did during my last pull up record.

728
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:03,210
I listened to that song for rocky one 
round 14.

729
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,200
Rocky gets knocked down the corner.
I've listened to that two minutes and 13

730
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:12,040
seconds long.
Listen to on repeat for 17 hours.

731
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,680
Merry Christmas.

732
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:20,530
Merry Christmas man.
Seventeen hours man.

733
00:32:20,531 --> 00:32:23,230
I went to assess the dark,
dark evil.

734
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,520
I have a picture of my hand.
The book.

735
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,970
I was in a dark.
I went to.

736
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,280
I went to a place,
man that I'm like,

737
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,980
I can do anything here.
We got to live here for awhile.

738
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,010
Can I kept on feeling that wreck?
I go,

739
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,470
I don't want to see a pull up bar again.
I mean like I did 67,000

740
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:40,160
plus man.

741
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,030
Like this is my throat.
I'm like,

742
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,590
I can't,
I don't want to see no pull up.

743
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,400
So I was like,
I'm,

744
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,930
I'm doing this.
Come hell or high water,

745
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,360
man.
I broke it out.

746
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,060
It's just a bit.
Let me hear this.

747
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:59,120
The music's not going to always be 
there.

748
00:32:59,121 --> 00:33:00,760
The TV,
those transactions,

749
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,600
total things,
Jim Right now and all this loud music.

750
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:10,650
People needed to get fired up.
They needed to stay motivated to fight.

751
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,430
Then you can go in the gym,
do whatever they're going to do.

752
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,600
Motivation that keeps you going

753
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,720
and when you're doing this the whole 
time you're doing this,

754
00:33:38,721 --> 00:33:40,970
you're doing some of the hardest chin 
ups you can do.

755
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:45,110
You've got a chain around your neck 
posted folks that are just listening and

756
00:33:45,111 --> 00:33:48,320
you're pulling down on ropes.
You're doing chin ups on it.

757
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:49,860
Looks like taped up ropes.
Yes sir.

758
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:50,781
That's what it is.
Yeah.

759
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:52,940
Those are grip grip.
That's like Jujitsu guys.

760
00:33:52,941 --> 00:33:54,040
Do a lot of those.
Yes.

761
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:54,750
I was,
uh,

762
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,440
I,
I spoke to the University of Alabama and

763
00:33:57,441 --> 00:33:58,191
they were in there,
you know,

764
00:33:58,191 --> 00:33:58,821
most,
you know,

765
00:33:58,821 --> 00:33:59,810
most of these athletes,
man,

766
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,450
get hype.
So that music is blaring.

767
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,500
Yeah.
I'm like,

768
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:03,860
man,
what?

769
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,380
That shit comes off and you get popped 
in.

770
00:34:06,381 --> 00:34:11,381
Your fucking mouth was on the sidelines.
Brother was going to happen.

771
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,880
We can say to yourself then.
So that's,

772
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,480
that's how I trained my mind,
man.

773
00:34:17,481 --> 00:34:18,031
I,
Trey,

774
00:34:18,031 --> 00:34:19,580
with mark,
I'm going to get popped in my mouth,

775
00:34:19,581 --> 00:34:20,414
man.
I'm going to get popped in the back of 

776
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:25,670
an alley one day.
A man running around doing what I do and

777
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,830
there's gonna be no music.
You better fire,

778
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,300
figured out a pto.
Jamie's cheating.

779
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,520
I was telling you

780
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,880
when I first started running,
people said,

781
00:34:36,881 --> 00:34:38,370
do you run with music as I know,
running,

782
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,380
cheating when you have music on 
cheating,

783
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,740
you're cheating.
You listen to music.

784
00:34:41,741 --> 00:34:44,470
But now listen to music all the time,
but more than I listen to music,

785
00:34:44,471 --> 00:34:45,304
I listen to books,
but books on tape or audio books and 

786
00:34:48,551 --> 00:34:49,690
yours is,
like I said,

787
00:34:49,691 --> 00:34:52,300
it's been the last two weeks has been my
running partner.

788
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,830
Well I appreciate that man.
Man.

789
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:55,843
That's phenomenal.
And you're doing this kind of 

790
00:34:56,891 --> 00:34:57,910
independently,
right?

791
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,290
Yeah.

792
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,220
So what I did,
man,

793
00:34:59,221 --> 00:35:03,270
is I pissed off a lot of people.
I was um,

794
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,163
I.
So in 2012 I got an offer from my book 

795
00:35:06,811 --> 00:35:09,120
for $30,000.
I said,

796
00:35:09,121 --> 00:35:12,150
you can go fuck yourself.
No a hill.

797
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,670
I went through brother.
So then everybody was like,

798
00:35:14,671 --> 00:35:17,310
you know,
we don't see a market for a black guy,

799
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,400
ultra runner,
fat guy who couldn't read like a,

800
00:35:22,481 --> 00:35:24,540
you know,
15 percent of Americans black,

801
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,403
you know,
we don't see many know people buying 

802
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:27,324
your book.
They think only black people buy your 

803
00:35:29,491 --> 00:35:31,320
book.
There's some ignorant people out there,

804
00:35:31,321 --> 00:35:33,120
man.
Everybody that follows me is white.

805
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:38,450
I don't have a plan like three black 
flowers was always a big fan.

806
00:35:40,531 --> 00:35:41,310
He's black.
Yeah.

807
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,143
He's like,
he's like a unusual species out there 

808
00:35:43,681 --> 00:35:44,514
man.
And so I'm sitting or walking around 

809
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:46,620
going,
man,

810
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,453
you don't even know who.
Like everybody I talked to his wife 

811
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:49,890
like,
you know,

812
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:50,723
it's the ignorance of the world and I'm 
in these meetings here in this kind of 

813
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:53,310
stuff.

814
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:56,460
So now 2018,
I get a $300,000

815
00:35:56,461 --> 00:36:00,000
offer for a first time author.
So I'm sitting back,

816
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:01,170
you know,
and I'm like,

817
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:02,190
my God man,
you know,

818
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,680
I used to make like fucking $60,000
a year,

819
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,260
you know,
this is the biggest payday yet.

820
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,660
And I started thinking,
I took that one second.

821
00:36:09,661 --> 00:36:12,120
I talked about the one second decision a
lot about what I went through my life,

822
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:13,770
what I've done,
and I was like,

823
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:16,650
you know what?
I struggled so hard in my life.

824
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:17,484
I went through so much that the biggest 
trophy I own now is that book the 

825
00:36:21,391 --> 00:36:22,280
biggest trophy?
I don't know.

826
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,210
It's not the book itself,
which what's in the book?

827
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:25,963
It's what like,
I don't give a fuck if that sells one 

828
00:36:28,141 --> 00:36:29,730
copy,
honest to God,

829
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:31,650
man,
like like my what I did,

830
00:36:31,651 --> 00:36:32,484
and that's what I hope people understand
your life in a journey you put yourself 

831
00:36:35,221 --> 00:36:36,650
through.
There's no.

832
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:37,563
There's nothing more than that and 
that's all I want people to do is 

833
00:36:40,021 --> 00:36:44,550
realize that you have to struggle.
You have to struggle.

834
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:46,770
The bigger the struggle,
the bigger the piece,

835
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,230
the bigger the suffering,
the more peace.

836
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,460
I'm not just saying this because you're 
here,

837
00:36:50,461 --> 00:36:53,400
but this book is valuable.
This book is very valuable.

838
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:58,350
It's valuable to people like anybody.
That biography is a very valuable.

839
00:36:58,351 --> 00:36:59,184
When you get to see the mindset of a 
person who's done things that you 

840
00:37:01,651 --> 00:37:03,960
haven't done,
you get to understand like that.

841
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,610
They're overcoming sort of the same sort
of situations in their mind that you are

842
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:11,790
same insecurities and pitfalls,
but everybody's going through it.

843
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:12,624
Man,

844
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,160
everybody that's.
That's one thing I say.

845
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,730
I'm blessed that way,
that my story.

846
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,373
There's no color involved in it.
It's a human story about struggle and I 

847
00:37:23,401 --> 00:37:25,830
happened to be in so many different 
situations.

848
00:37:25,831 --> 00:37:30,660
There's so many people can relate to 
about struggle that I guarantee you mark

849
00:37:30,661 --> 00:37:31,860
my word,
you read that book.

850
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:36,450
There will be a section of that book 
that resonates with is hardcore.

851
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,343
It will make you think if,
if you're not ready to think about your 

852
00:37:39,721 --> 00:37:40,554
life and think about,
you know where you can be and think 

853
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:45,660
about what you haven't done,
the book's not for you.

854
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:46,973
If you're already ready to really self 
reflect and hold yourself accountable 

855
00:37:49,381 --> 00:37:50,490
for where you're at and where you're 
not,

856
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,340
the book is not for you.
It's real.

857
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,283
I've read a lot of self help books and 
I've listened to a lot of self help 

858
00:37:56,201 --> 00:37:58,240
books on tape too,
and a lot of.

859
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,163
There's some of them that I have to shut
off after to shut off a quarter way and 

860
00:38:02,081 --> 00:38:03,760
I feel like someone's lying to me.
I just like,

861
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:05,920
you're bullshitting me.
You're just saying things.

862
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,850
This doesn't resonate with me.
It doesn't,

863
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,990
it's not working.
Like I'll give it a chance,

864
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:12,610
I'll give it a chance,
but if I'm,

865
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,503
you know,
half hour in two hours and it's still 

866
00:38:15,131 --> 00:38:17,170
the same nonsense.
I don't feel anything.

867
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,610
I'm getting itchy listening to,
you know,

868
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,810
I just want to pull the headphones off 
and I'll just kill it.

869
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,300
I'll stop it.
This was the total opposite.

870
00:38:25,301 --> 00:38:26,410
This one man I was,
I was,

871
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:30,900
I was running extra mile so I could stay
with the headphones on and the.

872
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:31,923
The thing that I think is gonna Happen 
with this book is people going to get 

873
00:38:34,691 --> 00:38:35,020
it.

874
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,640
They're going to get a hold of it,
whether it's an audio book,

875
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,940
the or the book book and they're gonna,
they're gonna recommend it and then it's

876
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:42,490
going to spread like wildfire.
This is a powerful book.

877
00:38:42,491 --> 00:38:45,130
This is a real self help book.
This is like,

878
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,023
this is a real one,
like it's not like someone orchestrates 

879
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:52,960
this whole thing like what I'm gonna do 
is I'm going to become a motivator.

880
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,423
I'm going to be a personal influencer.
I'm going to be that guy that goes out 

881
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:57,304
there and tells people you can optimize 
your life and there's so many of those 

882
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:03,530
fucking guys out there.
That's not me,

883
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,840
man.
I know this one dude.

884
00:39:04,841 --> 00:39:05,674
I ran into him recently.
I ran into him at this restaurant and 

885
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:07,864
he's fat as fuck.
He's got this big old belly and I know 

886
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:10,714
he does these,
these motivational things and I'm 

887
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,440
looking at him like,
what are you talking about man week?

888
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,210
Look at your body,
look at your own temple.

889
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:23,650
Look at the vehicle you're carrying 
around this fucking doughnut around your

890
00:39:23,651 --> 00:39:26,390
waist is just.
He was eating shitty food.

891
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,200
Look soft and like,
wake up bitch.

892
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,240
People are doing that now man.
I mean people are talking to this noise.

893
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,860
Exactly,
and I see him,

894
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,290
I know him.
I'm not gonna say names,

895
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,820
but I know and I'm like,
man,

896
00:39:38,821 --> 00:39:39,654
dude,
do you know why my life is miserable 

897
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:41,514
right now?
Because I can't go on your show right 

898
00:39:43,321 --> 00:39:44,820
now,
your podcasts,

899
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:49,960
if I didn't get after it this morning.
So I cannot talk to people unless you're

900
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,813
authentic.
I'm authentic because I used to be the 

901
00:39:52,111 --> 00:39:54,270
most unauthentic motherfucker on the 
planet.

902
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:57,240
Now I had this voicemail saying,
oh no,

903
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,400
I'll call you up if I lie to you about 
something.

904
00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:00,880
Even a white lie and Yo,
Joe,

905
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:01,723
guess what dude?

906
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,310
I fucking live here man.
Like that wasn't real.

907
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,920
It will bother me that badly now.
You know.

908
00:40:07,921 --> 00:40:10,830
So another thing I didn't.
Which funny Bella's book stuff,

909
00:40:10,831 --> 00:40:11,664
man,
I didn't set out to write a book like 

910
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,680
literally man,
when I was 24 years old and a couch,

911
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,480
fat spraying for cockroaches eating 
donuts and drinking milkshakes.

912
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,333
I did not plan on doing this.
All I wanted to do with chance to 

913
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:26,310
fucking reflection in it.
They're going to mirror this is all this

914
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,940
about.
It's,

915
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,530
it's,
it's a byproduct of,

916
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:29,860
of that.
And that's,

917
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,110
that's the funny thing about it.
Like it was like,

918
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,640
oh my God,
David Goggins,

919
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:33,900
but you know what the hell?
I'm like,

920
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,720
what the fuck?
That's why it works though.

921
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,293
It works because you really did do it.
You really did do all those things and 

922
00:40:42,351 --> 00:40:47,210
you show how you did it and you're not 
using any bullshit theatrical jargon.

923
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,290
You're not.
You're not saying a bunch of buzz words.

924
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,170
Can you live the life of an actual 
person?

925
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,840
I can show you how,
and you look into this guy talk and he's

926
00:40:56,841 --> 00:41:01,580
got a neck like a pencil,
and his body's just frail like you don't

927
00:41:01,581 --> 00:41:03,740
even understand adversity.
You don't understand.

928
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:04,783
Overcoming.
This is not the secret is involved in 

929
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,380
the law of fucking attraction attraction
here.

930
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,110
This ain't no attraction here,
man.

931
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:19,010
This love nonsense.
This is no nonsense,

932
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,350
no nonsense.
This is a real self help book,

933
00:41:21,351 --> 00:41:22,610
man.
This is the real deal.

934
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,593
That's how you self help you self-help 
by people who've done it and you learn 

935
00:41:26,031 --> 00:41:28,130
what they did and you realize there's no
shortcuts,

936
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:32,690
and then you learn to embrace that no 
shortcut mentality and enjoy.

937
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,980
Enjoy the suffering and the grind of n 
what we talked about earlier.

938
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:39,410
There's no fucking finish line doesn't 
exist.

939
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,410
You know what's funny about that is I 
have people now,

940
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,390
so when I was in the worst part of my 
life,

941
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,183
those people want to bring you back in.
Those people's like you can see who you 

942
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:50,144
hang out with like when you and your 
worst and when you try to get better 

943
00:41:52,671 --> 00:41:53,504
with what makes it hard to get better is
that you are hanging around people who 

944
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,190
like,
let's say you're an alcoholic,

945
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,503
you hanging around people who drink and 
I say you want to stop drinking those 

946
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:05,540
people and to bring you back in.
Like I used to be this guy,

947
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:06,570
this guy who was,
who you know,

948
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:10,270
who wasn't worth anything.
Now those people who are still there,

949
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,200
they're 16,
17,

950
00:42:12,201 --> 00:42:13,100
18,
30 years ago.

951
00:42:13,101 --> 00:42:14,930
They try and get you back there.
So the hardest part,

952
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:16,220
you got to see who you're hanging out 
with,

953
00:42:16,221 --> 00:42:17,054
man.

954
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,750
You gotta hang out with the people who 
you want to be like the most people will

955
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:21,720
definitely dragged.
You know,

956
00:42:21,721 --> 00:42:22,554
Jackie down and especially if you're 
around someone that makes a lot of 

957
00:42:24,531 --> 00:42:26,900
excuses and they're always failing.
Oh,

958
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:27,783
those is like they're,
they're the opposite of inspiration 

959
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:32,350
there,
like a vacuum to suck in it,

960
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,920
out of you.
Why are you doing today,

961
00:42:33,921 --> 00:42:36,020
man?
Why are you getting up against so early?

962
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:37,700
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?

963
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,250
The people you're hanging around with 
me,

964
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:42,170
it will suck the fucking life out of you
sometimes.

965
00:42:42,171 --> 00:42:43,970
Just got to be alone with man.
Get your shit in,

966
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:44,923
and then there's also people that are 
you going to be around that are always 

967
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:50,180
failing and always fucking up,
and then they're always coming to you to

968
00:42:50,181 --> 00:42:53,180
try to get you to help them become a 
giant burden.

969
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,103
Yes.
Never look in the mirror and get their 

970
00:42:55,311 --> 00:42:58,040
own shit together and they're always 
looking for external help.

971
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:59,900
That's right.
Always looking for a store.

972
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,020
People don't want to go in deep.
Met All the answer inside of you.

973
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,680
It's a very primitive way how I call 
this book is written.

974
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,060
It's primitive.
It's,

975
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,980
it's,
it's very barbarian.

976
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:10,853
It's how we all think.
It's how it's how a man once walked the 

977
00:43:14,031 --> 00:43:17,410
earth and then we'd get all soft and all
these computers and shit.

978
00:43:17,411 --> 00:43:18,244
When we start going away from the most 
powerful thing we have is our fucking 

979
00:43:21,321 --> 00:43:24,190
brain is our mind and we don't use 
anymore.

980
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:27,590
So you know,
it's like everything has to be so quick.

981
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:28,813
Yeah.
You use your mind when it comes to 

982
00:43:29,661 --> 00:43:30,800
certain things.
Right?

983
00:43:30,801 --> 00:43:33,620
But what you're saying is you don't use 
your mind when it comes to.

984
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,010
Exactly.
That is it.

985
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:38,080
You can't google that shit.
Right?

986
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:40,240
Hey,
let me google how to suffer.

987
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:43,410
No,
that ain't gonna be in there.

988
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,770
They ain't gonna be in there.
It could be in there.

989
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,030
It's not in there.
It doesn't exist.

990
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:52,600
Find some water.
We'll code.

991
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,533
And what's interesting is that that is a
mind thing and people think of mine 

992
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:00,690
things they think of calculating 
mathematics literature.

993
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:01,311
No,
no,

994
00:44:01,311 --> 00:44:01,571
no,
no,

995
00:44:01,571 --> 00:44:01,851
no,
no,

996
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:02,151
no,
no.

997
00:44:02,151 --> 00:44:03,160
There's many aspects.

998
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:04,900
That's it.
Don't overthink it.

999
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:07,480
Don't overthink it.
Put your shoes on.

1000
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:08,314
Lace them up.

1001
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:13,940
So you got to do my friend.
Don't overthink the process,

1002
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:15,103
but see what?
Because you've overcome because you've 

1003
00:44:16,581 --> 00:44:17,414
accomplished so much now that even when 
you talk about that moment of like 

1004
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,553
embracing that suck,
like you see the biggest smile on your 

1005
00:44:25,881 --> 00:44:26,714
face,
like you've got a total different 

1006
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,890
approach to it than the average person.
The average.

1007
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,063
You talk to them

1008
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,130
about doing chin ups for 24 hours or 
anything fucking crazy.

1009
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:39,820
They don't look like there's like a.
A negative of doom feelings.

1010
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,680
The thing about it,
man,

1011
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,543
I talk about my book openmindedness.
What separates me from a lot of people 

1012
00:44:44,761 --> 00:44:49,500
is they go into a daunting task in the 
task is overwhelming.

1013
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:51,840
Like when I heard the pull up records,
4,020

1014
00:44:51,841 --> 00:44:53,880
pull ups.
Not talking about breaking this record.

1015
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,370
People are like,
oh my God.

1016
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,130
I went right to a pen and paper like,
what are you doing?

1017
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,310
I'm doing the math man.
We talking about.

1018
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,173
I'm open minded to the fact that okay,
if I do five pull ups on the minute for 

1019
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:08,190
so many hours I can get 20 pull ups in.
How much time do you have to rest?

1020
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,233
I was breaking the math down.
You have to be open minded to the 

1021
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:13,140
possibilities that I can do this.

1022
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,273
Once you shut your mind down to the 
possibility that it can be achieved is 

1023
00:45:16,441 --> 00:45:18,090
no way can happen,
so that's my,

1024
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:18,924
my,
my eyes and my body light up about 

1025
00:45:20,161 --> 00:45:22,740
things because I know that if you're in 
a fight,

1026
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:27,390
you have to attack,
you have to keep attacking.

1027
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,170
The enemy has to know he is not going to
give up.

1028
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,540
You must break the soul.
Whatever the fuck is in front of you.

1029
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:35,063
That's what I realized.
I was never breaking the soul anything 

1030
00:45:37,021 --> 00:45:39,390
in front of me,
so that's why I came with a thing called

1031
00:45:39,391 --> 00:45:40,650
taking solos.
In my book,

1032
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,170
I started to devise ways to break a soul
of a human being of a,

1033
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,110
of an object,
of,

1034
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:49,950
of whatever's in front of me.
If he keep on attacking something,

1035
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:54,180
nothing wants to stand in front of 
anything that is relentless.

1036
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:55,943
Nothing to taking.
Sole part of the book is really 

1037
00:45:58,591 --> 00:45:59,424
interesting because you talked about 
like the the mind shift that you had 

1038
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,720
when you were in bud's.

1039
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,000
Yes sir.
A,

1040
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,670
that's an intense part of the book.
Is it is a,

1041
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:11,340
that's when a lot of stuff started 
clicking man.

1042
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:14,190
I started watching those instructors on 
the side because you know,

1043
00:46:14,191 --> 00:46:16,020
there's,
there's three shifts.

1044
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,180
There's eight instructors,
three shifts because you know,

1045
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,010
the guy's going through through hell 
week.

1046
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,830
They're up all day and all night for her
and 30 hours.

1047
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:26,640
This is the promise.
Land of mental hardening for me.

1048
00:46:26,641 --> 00:46:29,880
I love this place.
And you have the instructors who,

1049
00:46:29,881 --> 00:46:30,714
who,
you know,

1050
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:31,860
they've been there,
done that.

1051
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:35,010
Now they're instructing you.
So they do the eight hour shift they had

1052
00:46:35,011 --> 00:46:36,870
their park is honest,
usually cold coffee,

1053
00:46:36,871 --> 00:46:39,930
drinking their coffee and they're 
beating the crap out of us.

1054
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,900
And when I started realizing I started 
playing mind games and I was like,

1055
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:43,734
you know what?
I bet these fuckers are looking at us 

1056
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:50,490
judging themselves about when they were 
going through hell week about.

1057
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:51,743
Let me see.
I'm looking at Goggins right now is 

1058
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:55,170
better than him.
I was burden that God Burton that fucker

1059
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:56,580
over there.
And I was like,

1060
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,010
okay,
okay,

1061
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:00,540
you're going to judge me.
Right?

1062
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:02,563
So I'm going to do to you.
So I started doing was I got my boat 

1063
00:47:05,461 --> 00:47:06,271
crew.
Boat crew too.

1064
00:47:06,271 --> 00:47:08,010
It's in the book is a great,
great story.

1065
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,073
Say kimber guys,
you can't break boat crew that can't 

1066
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:11,394
break broke crew too.
So is Wednesday is Wednesday and 

1067
00:47:14,521 --> 00:47:17,010
everybody's broken.
Everybody's beat up man and like this.

1068
00:47:17,011 --> 00:47:19,470
And then you start moving like a robot.
Everybody's like,

1069
00:47:19,471 --> 00:47:21,180
just kind of just trying to get through 
hell week now.

1070
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:24,480
And your is at and they know Wednesdays 
like that over the hump.

1071
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:26,100
I love that.
You talked about that in the book too,

1072
00:47:26,101 --> 00:47:26,934
that they put it in your head Wednesday 
you're going to be tired and another 

1073
00:47:29,431 --> 00:47:30,180
thing they.

1074
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,110
They tell you how you're supposed to 
feel.

1075
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,170
So you are feeling that way.
I was like,

1076
00:47:35,171 --> 00:47:36,004
ah,
don't let these motherfuckers tell you 

1077
00:47:36,941 --> 00:47:38,410
how you're supposed to feel.
No,

1078
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:41,410
it's day one motherfucker.
This is our one.

1079
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,390
So I was getting my book who all jacked 
up.

1080
00:47:43,391 --> 00:47:45,520
I said we're gonna.
Take these motherfuckers souls.

1081
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,980
So when they had us doing a simple thing
that God's.

1082
00:47:48,981 --> 00:47:52,140
You're struggling with broker tours.
This launched in the fucking bone.

1083
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:52,931
You're yelling.
Yeah,

1084
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:55,790
you can't fucking hurt us.
Get her boat crew too,

1085
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,123
and I looked on the instructor's faces 
and it looked like someone had just 

1086
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:04,450
fucked with their soul and I looked at 
my and my broker and I said,

1087
00:48:04,451 --> 00:48:05,284
hey,
guess what?

1088
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,450
Those motherfuckers aren't fucking 
tonight.

1089
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,440
Can we own space in their fucking head?
We own space.

1090
00:48:11,441 --> 00:48:12,274
They're gonna.
Think about us tonight to think about 

1091
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:14,780
how they Kellen boners.

1092
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:15,663
That's right.
How on Wednesday are these guys doing 

1093
00:48:19,151 --> 00:48:20,500
this?
And screaming out,

1094
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:22,330
you can't hurt.
We were.

1095
00:48:22,331 --> 00:48:24,460
We were bringing the fight.
We were tagging.

1096
00:48:24,461 --> 00:48:25,810
So.
So when you keep on doing that,

1097
00:48:25,811 --> 00:48:26,890
guess what?
People start doing.

1098
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:31,600
I ain't fucking with these guns no more 
so boat crew to got a lot more sleep.

1099
00:48:31,601 --> 00:48:33,490
Real crew to became that broker.
Like,

1100
00:48:33,491 --> 00:48:34,690
Hey,
we can.

1101
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:37,090
We just kept charging and we start 
fueling off of that.

1102
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:39,070
We started a few,
not the fact that man,

1103
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,730
it takes one second of energy to still 
everybody's.

1104
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,680
And then you have all the energy you 
need.

1105
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,560
So you need,
you need to look at someone's eyes.

1106
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,633
You know how it is when you fight 
somebody and you broke that 

1107
00:48:49,571 --> 00:48:50,830
motherfucker.
It's like,

1108
00:48:50,831 --> 00:48:51,491
Oh God,
man,

1109
00:48:51,491 --> 00:48:54,290
I don't want to go back to the next 
round and you feel like my gut,

1110
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:55,143
I can fight all day.

1111
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:59,410
I can fight all day long.
That's what taking Solos is,

1112
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:00,843
but you have to have the will to heart 
the courage to go that distance when 

1113
00:49:05,891 --> 00:49:06,724
you're exactly jacked up.
We have nothing left to give and give 

1114
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:11,163
more.
That is an interesting thing about the 

1115
00:49:12,971 --> 00:49:16,810
mind is that you can find inspiration 
and when you find inspiration,

1116
00:49:16,811 --> 00:49:19,240
when you get charged up,
all the sudden you have energy.

1117
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:20,440
That's right.
It's right.

1118
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,200
It's weird.
I talked about in the book also is about

1119
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,513
I learned how to control my adrenals.
If you know how you know how you get 

1120
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:33,170
that fight or flight response when you 
get to move real quick and you know,

1121
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:35,320
I,
I started learning the mind a lot.

1122
00:49:35,321 --> 00:49:36,154
How to get myself jacked extremely fast,
like in a horrible environment where 

1123
00:49:40,871 --> 00:49:44,380
everybody's miserable.
I've learned how to really find strength

1124
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:47,110
in the misery when everybody's 
suffering.

1125
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:50,800
Everybody's all poopy pants,
their mentalities down and everything.

1126
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,890
I started just like my God,
this is where I shine,

1127
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,333
and I started using all that misery for 
tons and tons of tons of drive and 

1128
00:50:00,071 --> 00:50:00,904
motivation to to to then lead people 
further because you can get a lot of 

1129
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,020
power through misery and once people see
that,

1130
00:50:08,021 --> 00:50:10,930
my God goggins is fucking going.
Then everybody says,

1131
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:11,823
Roger that let me get my shit and go to.
So I started realizing that if you can 

1132
00:50:16,871 --> 00:50:19,060
just find strength just a little bit 
longer,

1133
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:20,253
you'll have a crew of people following 
you along the way and that is another 

1134
00:50:23,441 --> 00:50:26,710
thing that no one can ever teach you.
There's you.

1135
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,040
You're going to have to learn that on 
your

1136
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,873
own.
You're going to have to figure out how 

1137
00:50:29,811 --> 00:50:32,870
to pull that energy out of your mind on 
your own.

1138
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,420
There's not this,
there's no book.

1139
00:50:35,421 --> 00:50:37,100
You can read the.
All of a sudden I have it.

1140
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,960
I've got the technique.
Now I know how to do it.

1141
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:44,000
Now it's a grind that you have to start 
and finish on your own.

1142
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,013
You have to take great pleasure in the 
fact that no one wants to be with the 

1143
00:50:47,891 --> 00:50:50,420
fuck you're at right now.
Great pleasure in.

1144
00:50:50,421 --> 00:50:53,040
That almost makes it has to bring a 
passion.

1145
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,770
Nadia has to bring something very,
very weird audio man like you know,

1146
00:50:57,771 --> 00:50:59,330
people don't really understand what that
is.

1147
00:50:59,331 --> 00:51:00,950
When you're in the worst environment 
possible,

1148
00:51:00,951 --> 00:51:03,650
the worst situation possible,
and everybody's looking like,

1149
00:51:03,651 --> 00:51:04,071
God,
man,

1150
00:51:04,071 --> 00:51:08,210
I hope this ends.
And you see that time slows down and you

1151
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:09,044
see that you're,
you're feeling that everybody has that 

1152
00:51:11,421 --> 00:51:12,350
look on their face like,
God,

1153
00:51:12,351 --> 00:51:13,180
this got to go.

1154
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,860
I don't want to be anymore.
Have you ever gotten Rhabdo?

1155
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,370
Rhabdo my lowest.
So yes sir.

1156
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,270
Did you get it?
Yes sir.

1157
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,200
Yes sir.
When did you get?

1158
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,053
I got it all.
My second pull up record attempt and I 

1159
00:51:23,011 --> 00:51:28,011
talked about it a little bit in the book
there and I have sickle cell trait and a

1160
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,084
young kid just died from Rhabdo from 
sickle cell is not a good thing 

1161
00:51:32,751 --> 00:51:34,100
obviously.
Um,

1162
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:36,680
and you grabbed those a bad thing for 
having sickle cell.

1163
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:39,380
You have sickle cell trait,
but you don't have the disease will have

1164
00:51:39,381 --> 00:51:40,214
the disease.
A buddy of mine died from it when I was 

1165
00:51:41,541 --> 00:51:42,374
a kid.
Really?

1166
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,670
Yeah.
Oh God.

1167
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,470
I used to fight with Mr.
train with.

1168
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,540
Yeah.
He was always sick.

1169
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,420
You'd have to get sick.
Is horrible.

1170
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:50,263
Be Gone.
You'd be out of the gym for months and 

1171
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,140
come back and he'd just be trying to get
his body back in shape again.

1172
00:51:56,110 --> 00:52:00,770
Anyone up dying is a talented guy too.
When you got it,

1173
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:03,890
what did you have to do?
So they put me in hospital for awhile.

1174
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:05,323
That's when my hand got real messed up 
and my fluids were extremely low and I 

1175
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:13,510
had done like 300 pull ups and they're 
like,

1176
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,080
man,
your body is wrapped up.

1177
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,970
We just not drinking water while you're 
doing it.

1178
00:52:16,971 --> 00:52:21,320
I was drinking water but not enough.
So I was sipping this carbohydrate drink

1179
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:25,130
and um,
my calories are extremely low.

1180
00:52:25,131 --> 00:52:26,630
I didn't know how much I was going to 
burn through.

1181
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,850
And you burn through an awful lot of 
calories,

1182
00:52:28,851 --> 00:52:29,331
man.
Doing that.

1183
00:52:29,331 --> 00:52:32,330
When you pull up to that many hours and 
with the repetition,

1184
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:35,420
with using a single points of just my 
hands and my biceps,

1185
00:52:35,421 --> 00:52:38,000
my back,
like my body was swollen,

1186
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:38,834
like the Pillsbury doughboy.
I mean it looked horrible and I'm so 

1187
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,260
they kept me in there for a while.
But how long?

1188
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:46,363
Probably about a eight hours.
I was about eight hours and ivs and 

1189
00:52:49,761 --> 00:52:52,220
stuff like that.
So they just is basically three.

1190
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:56,420
She had Florida event tons of fluid and 
they sent me home though.

1191
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:58,003
So I went home that night.
And how long did you wait before you 

1192
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:02,083
jumped back at it?
I think it was back in the pool bar 

1193
00:53:04,131 --> 00:53:05,270
about a week and a half later.

1194
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,940
And then I broke the record of 66 weeks 
later when I broke the record.

1195
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:14,030
Jesus Christ.
So when you,

1196
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,860
when you did get back on the pull up 
bar,

1197
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,300
that was how fucked up your body from it
was bad.

1198
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:23,470
But what I do is like I've done through 
everything it,

1199
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:24,920
which isn't real smart.
I.

1200
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:25,973
It works for me.
So I'm not saying do this is I've 

1201
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:31,470
trained through a lot of my injuries.
I started developing.

1202
00:53:31,471 --> 00:53:32,304
I started doing that in butts and still 
training because I'm still training 

1203
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,253
though.
They know you got start from day one or 

1204
00:53:36,901 --> 00:53:37,734
day is kick you out.
So I started from day one enough so my 

1205
00:53:39,661 --> 00:53:43,350
third time going through I was really 
jacked up when you had pneumonia,

1206
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:45,870
he had pneumonia and I had really bad 
stress fractures,

1207
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:48,390
so my stress fractures,
so I was literally,

1208
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,224
I would put a sock on and then duct tape
my foot all the way up to the top or to 

1209
00:53:53,551 --> 00:53:56,370
the minimum ink or tending my calf it 
can.

1210
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:59,820
My stress fracture were so bad.
So like the pivot point between my ankle

1211
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:05,090
and my Shin as cast that all the way up.
And so I went through for several months

1212
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:06,443
for a few months with stress fractures,
which was crazy about that is they 

1213
00:54:09,481 --> 00:54:12,330
healed.
By the time I got the third phase,

1214
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:14,400
my stress fractures are healed.
Wow.

1215
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,010
And I don't even know how rhyme or 
reason behind it.

1216
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,230
I ran on him a few months later they 
were here.

1217
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,840
Wow,
so I don't know what that means.

1218
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:22,733
Push through the agony and eventually 
your body just said this crazy fuck is 

1219
00:54:26,101 --> 00:54:28,080
not gonna stop.
It's true statement.

1220
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,190
Yeah,
it's weird.

1221
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,050
A lot of my injuries I've just pushed 
through and they've uh,

1222
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:33,600
uh,
duct tape it up.

1223
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,990
Have you ever had to have surgery on an 
of.

1224
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:36,943
No,
just heartless to couple heart 

1225
00:54:37,351 --> 00:54:38,184
surgeries,
but um,

1226
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,140
none of my actual physical body.

1227
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:41,610
And what was your heart surgery for 
again?

1228
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:44,610
You talked about this for asd.
I had a whole no hurt.

1229
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:47,100
Yeah.
So we've talked about more ridiculous.

1230
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,530
Yeah,
that's what we talked about that too,

1231
00:54:49,531 --> 00:54:50,364
man.
They uh,

1232
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:51,263
they,
they took me off and studied me for 

1233
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:56,340
awhile so they realized that my God,
I shouldn't even be in the military.

1234
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:58,260
I wasn't even qualified to be in the 
military,

1235
00:54:58,261 --> 00:54:59,880
the hole in my heart,
you know,

1236
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:02,760
let alone being special operations were 
jumping out planes and stuff like that.

1237
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:03,630
So I was,
I was lucky.

1238
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:04,523
How did they seal that up?
So they went in with a helix patch and 

1239
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:08,941
um,
you know,

1240
00:55:08,941 --> 00:55:09,774
through my,
for more artery femoral artery and they 

1241
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:13,510
went through,
put a patch and they realized,

1242
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,353
you know,
I missed like three or four years have 

1243
00:55:15,411 --> 00:55:17,760
been military career because this heart 
surgery.

1244
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:18,810
Wow.
Yeah.

1245
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:21,840
So I was,
I was off of jump status dive status.

1246
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:22,853
I was just a.
So that's what type of recruiting so 

1247
00:55:24,601 --> 00:55:26,850
much.
I stayed in recruiting for like three or

1248
00:55:26,851 --> 00:55:29,250
four years and um,
you know,

1249
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,800
I became like a navy recruiter when I 
was uh,

1250
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,810
you know,
doing this for awhile.

1251
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,850
So I got extended there because the 
heart surgery.

1252
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:36,743
And uh,
other than that you'd never had to have 

1253
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:39,750
any other surgeries.
Um,

1254
00:55:39,751 --> 00:55:41,170
no meniscus,
no nothing.

1255
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:42,510
No.
That's crazy.

1256
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,540
No.
And I've had some jacked up injuries,

1257
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:48,330
but see how I grew up,
you know,

1258
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,193
like I talked about in the book,
my dad and a believer in taking him to 

1259
00:55:50,661 --> 00:55:53,040
the hospital.
Like this is how it was,

1260
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:53,711
man.
It was,

1261
00:55:53,711 --> 00:55:55,230
it was barbarian stuff,
man.

1262
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:56,573
But you know,
you learn to deal with it and you live 

1263
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:01,140
it refined,
you get and Mris.

1264
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:01,830
Oh yeah.

1265
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:03,420
Get everything checked out.
Matter of fact,

1266
00:56:03,421 --> 00:56:04,180
me,
I was terrified.

1267
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:07,450
Mri machine for a long time.
I was like,

1268
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:09,150
man,
that's.

1269
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:11,170
Yeah,
there's a lot of.

1270
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,540
There's a lot behind that man.
But yeah,

1271
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,800
I've,
I've been checked out a lot.

1272
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:15,750
I've had a.
So like I said,

1273
00:56:15,751 --> 00:56:18,150
like six years ago,
I started stressing out like I thought I

1274
00:56:18,151 --> 00:56:20,010
was dying.
I couldn't even get a bed.

1275
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:24,830
So all that stretching out was from 
pretty much all these injuries I had.

1276
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:28,600
I had never really fixed in my body.
Get knotted up in more.

1277
00:56:28,601 --> 00:56:29,434
Not Up and up.
You mean it's going to heal one way or 

1278
00:56:31,751 --> 00:56:33,070
another?
It's going to heal and when it heals,

1279
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:33,913
not gonna heal.
Right.

1280
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:36,340
So he'll all jacked up and crooked.
Yeah.

1281
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:38,500
So I'm a.
I'm a cricket jacked up dude man,

1282
00:56:38,501 --> 00:56:39,430
but I still get it to.

1283
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,710
It's amazing that you haven't had like 
knee surgeries or anything like that and

1284
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:46,150
consider all the running.
Moved on.

1285
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:49,180
My left knee right now is in.
It's no joke.

1286
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:50,620
So like I say,
origin of pain.

1287
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:54,310
My right foot is messed up because my 
left knee.

1288
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:56,000
So right now I'm,
I'm,

1289
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:58,000
I'm taking care of my left knee is 
getting a lot better now,

1290
00:56:58,001 --> 00:57:00,100
but don't worry,
Cameron Hanes,

1291
00:57:00,101 --> 00:57:02,230
I was still be fucking out there running
with your ass.

1292
00:57:02,231 --> 00:57:05,200
I'm not going to get out of it buddy.
So if you listen motherfucker,

1293
00:57:05,201 --> 00:57:08,470
I will see you this weekend.
Merry Christmas.

1294
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:11,470
Just so you know,
rather merry Christmas.

1295
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:14,220
I'll say you don't know what's wrong 
with the knee.

1296
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:16,480
I have no idea.
It's from stretching.

1297
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,280
So basically stretching.
Yeah.

1298
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:19,114
So my whole,
because my body was in such bad 

1299
00:57:21,551 --> 00:57:22,384
alignment from just what I did to it,
that now I'm in this huge dress routine 

1300
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:30,040
in my body's getting back into 
alignment.

1301
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:33,070
So your muscles,
like I was a power lifter man,

1302
00:57:33,071 --> 00:57:35,140
like I,
I grew these huge muscles.

1303
00:57:35,141 --> 00:57:35,974
Now I'm the small guy and I just.
And from the stress in my body going 

1304
00:57:38,861 --> 00:57:39,694
through hell weeks and also my bias got,
became one not so as things start to 

1305
00:57:43,181 --> 00:57:45,550
open up,
joints start to hurt,

1306
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,440
things start to hurt.
And I'm like God.

1307
00:57:47,441 --> 00:57:48,274
So it's been this big long process.
So I'm fashion in better shape than 

1308
00:57:50,651 --> 00:57:52,750
ever.
My organs work better.

1309
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:56,320
I'm healthier than ever,
but I have these little tweaks here,

1310
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:59,260
little tweaks there from the fact that I
am now.

1311
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,430
My bio is locked in position from these 
muscles being so tight now.

1312
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:07,690
What do you weight now about one 82 83 
and you were like 300 plus pounds.

1313
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:08,563
You at your father's store?
I fattest when I weighed in it for the 

1314
00:58:10,151 --> 00:58:11,830
military.
I don't know when my fattest was,

1315
00:58:11,831 --> 00:58:14,970
but when I weighed in on that scale and 
Steven's sounds,

1316
00:58:14,971 --> 00:58:16,240
you'll hit that scale on me,
man.

1317
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,570
It was two 97 and he was like,
brother,

1318
00:58:19,571 --> 00:58:21,670
you got to lose 106 pounds.
I was like,

1319
00:58:21,671 --> 00:58:22,504
fuck this.
I can't tell if we're talking about 

1320
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:27,070
other.
How's that possible?

1321
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:29,390
So anyway,
it's just not a lot of time.

1322
00:58:29,391 --> 00:58:30,224
That's the crazy thing.
They didn't give you three months to 

1323
00:58:31,691 --> 00:58:32,524
lose that.
Thirty three pounds a month is a lot of 

1324
00:58:34,931 --> 00:58:36,580
fucking weight,
plus a few.

1325
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,590
Almost impossible.
And that's what I thought.

1326
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:41,290
That's what I thought.
But see you see the person I am now.

1327
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,930
It was 175 pounds in high school.
So I was.

1328
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:47,590
I was a skinny guy in high school,
so I made myself big.

1329
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,120
I'm a small bone person,
so it didn't.

1330
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,670
It wasn't it.
Trust me.

1331
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,533
It was hard.
It was hardest thing I've ever done in 

1332
00:58:55,121 --> 00:58:55,954
my life.
But what did people think around you 

1333
00:58:58,031 --> 00:58:59,230
when they saw you?
Three months later,

1334
00:58:59,231 --> 00:59:00,350
you're 100 pounds lighter.

1335
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:01,213
My mom couldn't believe it.
I'm a mom so I was living in 

1336
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:03,874
Indianapolis,
Indiana at the time and so I was trying 

1337
00:59:06,521 --> 00:59:08,680
to study for this as Baptist again,
that you know,

1338
00:59:08,681 --> 00:59:09,514
I got to take it again going into the 
navy and I'm out here trying to lose 

1339
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:12,664
weight and I'm working for this company.
He's spraying for cockroaches and also 

1340
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:20,090
are crap and I would lay in her pond in 
fucking November in Indiana,

1341
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,190
just laying or pond.
I was like,

1342
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:23,750
I'm going to bus.
I got to get hard,

1343
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,170
you know,
so I would lay in the pond,

1344
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,900
the pond and go for a run.
Just all wet cold.

1345
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:29,983
My Dad got his shirt with,
just frees up from ice and shit and I 

1346
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,640
was out to run and said,
what is wrong with you?

1347
00:59:34,641 --> 00:59:35,330
Man?
I'm like,

1348
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:38,000
you were that kid who just didn't want 
to wish ron with you,

1349
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,370
so she started seeing the transformation
that can,

1350
00:59:40,371 --> 00:59:42,140
you know,
this guy is obsessed,

1351
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:44,750
which I become somebody nestings new 
man.

1352
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:46,063
My Guy.
You actually lost that much weight that 

1353
00:59:47,481 --> 00:59:49,580
fast.
I love the fact that you did it,

1354
00:59:49,581 --> 00:59:50,414
but what?
What hurts me is when I hear stories 

1355
00:59:52,491 --> 00:59:53,324
about people that get like stomach 
stapling and surgery and all that shit 

1356
00:59:57,441 --> 00:59:58,274
that they do,
like you just need to just lose the 

1357
00:59:59,781 --> 01:00:03,200
weight and if you just did it,
you just did it the right way.

1358
01:00:03,201 --> 01:00:05,150
You would have earned it and if you earn
it,

1359
01:00:05,151 --> 01:00:06,860
you keep it.
That's the thing about it,

1360
01:00:06,861 --> 01:00:07,694
man.
Like we like to take these very quick 

1361
01:00:09,381 --> 01:00:10,214
fixes in life.
We want the six minute abs approach to 

1362
01:00:12,951 --> 01:00:13,760
life.
Yeah.

1363
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,310
Nah Man,
there's no permanent in that.

1364
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,700
There's no permanent in that man.
There's no scarring.

1365
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,410
They must be scarring.
Well,

1366
01:00:21,411 --> 01:00:24,710
people are terrified of this thing that 
you're saying that there's no end,

1367
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:28,100
that there's no finish line that 
everyday is a new thing that you have to

1368
01:00:28,101 --> 01:00:28,934
earn it still after all the shit you've 
done every day you get up and you have 

1369
01:00:31,491 --> 01:00:31,960
to earn it.

1370
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,920
Yes.
You know what's funny about that?

1371
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:39,050
I want you to be scared of it and yeah,
just getting fuel.

1372
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:42,350
It's great motivation in.
See if you look at it that way.

1373
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:47,180
The reason why I speak the way I speak 
because I believe in.

1374
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:52,220
I'm saying if I ever shut it down,
that's the end of me and whatever my 100

1375
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:55,154
percent will be.
I don't know what's gonna Happen to me 

1376
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:57,523
tomorrow.
Everywhere.

1377
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:01,670
If you can't run,
I will figure what the fuck I can do and

1378
01:01:01,671 --> 01:01:04,130
do that.
That will be my new hundred percent.

1379
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:07,040
You must continue to find your new 100 
percent.

1380
01:01:07,041 --> 01:01:07,874
Whatever life throws at you.
You must find what you can do now and 

1381
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:14,540
maybe come to the best you know,
scientists of all time.

1382
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,680
Who knows?
Watch out.

1383
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:16,543
You know what I'm saying?

1384
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,590
Who knows what that is?
An approach like this,

1385
01:01:21,591 --> 01:01:23,240
this approach,
this mental approach.

1386
01:01:23,241 --> 01:01:28,241
You can use that for anything.
Once you get past the quitting mechanism

1387
01:01:28,641 --> 01:01:29,474
of your mind,
once you get past that thing that this 

1388
01:01:31,611 --> 01:01:33,110
is applicable,
you can.

1389
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,153
You can take these lessons that you 
learned from these grueling runs as 

1390
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:41,780
losing 106 pounds in three months for 
all these different things of struggle.

1391
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:46,070
You can take these lessons of struggle 
and you can apply them to anything.

1392
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:46,963
Yes,
I talk about it in my book here about 

1393
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:53,540
that race I did that made sill training 
look like child's play in ranger school.

1394
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:56,960
That that first 100 miler.
I did write shit on myself and all kinds

1395
01:01:56,961 --> 01:01:57,794
of stuff.
That 19 hours it took me with no 

1396
01:01:59,811 --> 01:02:02,870
training.
I sum it up like this.

1397
01:02:02,871 --> 01:02:03,910
You're talking about struggle,
how you.

1398
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:07,790
How you can put so much of life and 
death struggle in that 19 hours.

1399
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:13,310
I lived five years,
five years of struggle of happiness,

1400
01:02:13,311 --> 01:02:15,500
of of depression,
success,

1401
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:16,393
failure in 19 hours.
That's what's great about some of these 

1402
01:02:18,621 --> 01:02:19,454
things.
I you get a wide range of life in just 

1403
01:02:23,251 --> 01:02:24,820
19 hours,
you know,

1404
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:28,440
like when you get to mile 50 in your 
mind saying we gotta get Outta here man,

1405
01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:29,910
and then you get like 60.
Okay,

1406
01:02:29,911 --> 01:02:30,744
we're feeling good.
You have all these highs and lows that 

1407
01:02:32,491 --> 01:02:33,324
you have to manage within this suck fest
of 19 hours and that's what I get from 

1408
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:39,480
lot of these different things that human
growth,

1409
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:43,380
no growth of the mind without friction.
There is no growth without friction.

1410
01:02:43,381 --> 01:02:44,214
There's no growth,
there's no growth and there's no 

1411
01:02:47,191 --> 01:02:48,024
satisfaction.
[inaudible] like there's no real like 

1412
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,113
people want to sit around and rest,
but you don't really appreciate 

1413
01:02:53,251 --> 01:02:54,420
restaurants.
You earned it.

1414
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:55,470
That's it.
And people,

1415
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:58,830
they think I'm their craziest person on 
the planet.

1416
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:03,060
You are so far removed from that day was
not even funny.

1417
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:08,360
I was 290 pounds twice in my life.
I do not like to do the things I do,

1418
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:12,720
but there's humongous satisfaction for 
doing it.

1419
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,073
The Schumacher satisfaction.
Lace on your shoes up saying I don't 

1420
01:03:16,321 --> 01:03:17,154
really want to go for a run today.
And then running and then getting back 

1421
01:03:20,851 --> 01:03:21,660
and saying,
wow,

1422
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:22,710
I did it,
I did it.

1423
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,233
And that's what it's about.
It's about these small steps to doing 

1424
01:03:25,921 --> 01:03:27,630
things you don't want to do.
You know Jocko,

1425
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:28,680
Jocko willink.
I know him.

1426
01:03:28,681 --> 01:03:31,260
Yeah.
Giagos not all great,

1427
01:03:31,261 --> 01:03:33,120
but I know him,
I know him pretty well.

1428
01:03:33,121 --> 01:03:33,960
He's,
he's awesome.

1429
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:36,900
But every morning you look at that 
motherfucker's instagram,

1430
01:03:36,901 --> 01:03:41,310
he's got a picture of his watch at 4:30.
He gets up at 4:30

1431
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,144
every morning and he earns a sunrise 
that's kind of like a motherfucker and 

1432
01:03:45,361 --> 01:03:46,500
then earns a sunrise.

1433
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:47,363
That's good stuff.
But it's that thing like there's no end 

1434
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,630
now as an n.
and it's scary.

1435
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:53,580
That is scary.
The scary.

1436
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:57,870
Everybody wants that holding hands while
the sun sets of retirement.

1437
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,450
You walk it off into the sunset.
The biggest question I get is,

1438
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:05,130
so when do you rest?
When did you recover?

1439
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,860
Yeah,
and I don't want to scare people,

1440
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:14,090
but the truth answer is I don't take any
days off.

1441
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:16,380
No days,
no days,

1442
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:17,940
seven days a week,
seven days a week.

1443
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:20,180
Well,
what does a normal day?

1444
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:22,650
Normal day for me,
a normal day.

1445
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,690
So let's say a Light Day,
Light Day,

1446
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:29,750
light day is at least a seven mile run.
I will every,

1447
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:32,850
every for every other day,
so about four days a week.

1448
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,280
Calisthenics,
plus gym workout.

1449
01:04:35,281 --> 01:04:39,090
So I don't do any gym workout without 
hitting pullups pushups.

1450
01:04:39,091 --> 01:04:39,924
I called nickels and dimes,
so like five pool of 10 pushups or I'll 

1451
01:04:43,231 --> 01:04:44,064
go,
you know,

1452
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:46,040
quarters and whatever.

1453
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:48,730
It's like 25 pull ups or in like 50 
pushups.

1454
01:04:48,731 --> 01:04:49,564
So I have all these different things I 
messed up so I will do weights with 

1455
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:57,700
calisthenics in every single night.
I stretch for at least every night.

1456
01:04:58,831 --> 01:05:02,610
I stretched for these two hours,
two hours every night.

1457
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:06,240
Every night.
So you stretch after you're done working

1458
01:05:06,241 --> 01:05:06,751
out?
Yeah.

1459
01:05:06,751 --> 01:05:07,584
So at nighttime usually I'll be either 
in a quiet room or I'll be watching tv 

1460
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:12,174
or I love sports.
We watching the game and I'm on the 

1461
01:05:14,371 --> 01:05:16,140
floor man.
And that's what I do.

1462
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:18,320
So you just stretch while you're doing 
stuff that's stress.

1463
01:05:18,321 --> 01:05:19,960
While I do stuff,
two hours,

1464
01:05:19,961 --> 01:05:20,794
a long ass time to stretch.
Is this just because you try to correct 

1465
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:27,010
or correct years of not doing that?
No years.

1466
01:05:27,011 --> 01:05:29,380
Have you ever fuck with yoga a lot?
Yeah.

1467
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,000
Yoga is this shit.
What do you do?

1468
01:05:31,001 --> 01:05:32,530
Hi Emma.
I have my own yoga,

1469
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:35,950
so I kind of been in my own little yoga 
for what my body needs.

1470
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:38,590
I've done hot yoga several times,
yogesh,

1471
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:42,730
huge yoga shoes,
like holding those positions and I'm big

1472
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:46,150
and hold them for a long period of time.
So that's where I stretching that.

1473
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,700
Other people said no,
hold stress for a long time.

1474
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:51,430
I hold it for a long period of time.
Come trying to get full range of motion.

1475
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:53,680
A lot of people go in for like,
like,

1476
01:05:53,681 --> 01:05:55,450
um,
like my shoulders are messed up.

1477
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:56,284
I get surgery on it now.
If you only have for range of motion in 

1478
01:05:58,751 --> 01:06:01,900
your body,
don't go in and get cut on man until you

1479
01:06:01,901 --> 01:06:04,090
know that your body is actually opened 
up.

1480
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,640
You know,
we start to get knuckle dragger syndrome

1481
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,830
from doing pushups.
He never worked.

1482
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:09,461
You're back,
you know,

1483
01:06:09,461 --> 01:06:09,960
like,
uh,

1484
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,040
like a,
like your rear delts.

1485
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:13,443
So here you are.
You start hunching over before you know 

1486
01:06:15,971 --> 01:06:17,150
what your joints are out of whack.

1487
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,333
You need to get for range of motion 
before you know how fucked up you truly 

1488
01:06:20,321 --> 01:06:21,850
are.
So I'm.

1489
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:24,310
I'm always working on a full range of 
motion like a kid.

1490
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:27,760
They run so effortlessly there.
Always going for range of motion.

1491
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:31,270
As you get older and tireder and sit in 
more stressed,

1492
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,730
your body starts to get more and more 
tight.

1493
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:36,180
Therefore,
your shoulders start to get a balance.

1494
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:38,330
Not a not a joint out of socket there 
free.

1495
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:39,560
No,
it's popping.

1496
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:42,640
Popping because you're fucking tight.
Open it up.

1497
01:06:42,641 --> 01:06:43,474
First,
open it up.

1498
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:44,313
Can you.
Can you touch your hands behind each 

1499
01:06:45,671 --> 01:06:47,910
other and raise them up behind you?
You know,

1500
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:48,753
it's all these different ranges of 
motion that I get real smart on from a 

1501
01:06:51,311 --> 01:06:54,400
guy and I took it to another level.
So are you.

1502
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:56,740
Do you work with a trainer or do you 
always work out by yourself?

1503
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:57,573
Everything I'd do.
I've never had training in my entire 

1504
01:06:58,601 --> 01:06:59,440
life.
Really?

1505
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:00,363
Never.
Not one time did he read about 

1506
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:05,980
physiology or exercise science or 
anything like that?

1507
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:07,390
Nothing.
Nothing.

1508
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:08,403
Nothing.
But what about like when they learn new 

1509
01:07:09,671 --> 01:07:14,620
shit about new ways to enhance shoulder 
stability or new exercises?

1510
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:19,830
You're not interested now?
I don't do for that reason.

1511
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:22,810
Still to this day,
man.

1512
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:25,120
Still this day,
to this day,

1513
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:30,690
it is for me to become better mentally.
How I look has just become a.

1514
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:37,270
like I have thousands,
thousands,

1515
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:40,740
hundreds of thousands of miles on this 
body running pullups,

1516
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:41,740
pushups,
swimming,

1517
01:07:41,741 --> 01:07:42,574
whatever you wanna call it.
This body is what it is now is from 

1518
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,980
repetition is not from studying.
You know,

1519
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:49,570
hey,
if you hold your plank for this long,

1520
01:07:49,571 --> 01:07:51,880
fuck all that bullshit.
I don't care about it.

1521
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,820
I just do it for my mind.
Right?

1522
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:57,790
I want to continue to harden because 
that's the only thing that I want.

1523
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:01,870
That's what I want.
I want to have that mind ready for life.

1524
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:03,970
But you also want to increase your range
of motion,

1525
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:06,250
range of motion.
She make sure that you're,

1526
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:07,290
you're,
you know,

1527
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:09,910
you're not causing any additional 
injuries to.

1528
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:13,450
Wouldn't you want to like stabilize some
areas that maybe you feel like you might

1529
01:08:13,451 --> 01:08:15,980
have weaknesses and find out new 
techniques to do that.

1530
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,830
Have you seen me with my shirt off?
No.

1531
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:19,970
Stable is fuck.

1532
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:24,080
He had his shirt off when you first came
here.

1533
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:25,073
I walked in it.
Dave got here early and by the time I 

1534
01:08:28,701 --> 01:08:30,860
got here he was already doing chin ups.
Stable.

1535
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:32,510
It's stable.
Do some pull ups.

1536
01:08:32,511 --> 01:08:34,360
Push ups mast and stable shit.
Yeah,

1537
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:35,431
but yeah,
but you're,

1538
01:08:35,431 --> 01:08:37,130
you know,
all that stuff is very important.

1539
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,080
Honestly.
Just all jokes aside,

1540
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:40,970
man,
full range of motion,

1541
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:43,850
getting your shoulder rotation,
all that stuff is very important.

1542
01:08:43,851 --> 01:08:46,100
I,
I learned a lot about that coming up.

1543
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:49,880
I had a lot of people I've worked out 
with our smart a bottle of this stuff.

1544
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:54,710
I'm a real old school meat eater,
like Bill Kasman hard type of lifter.

1545
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:55,903
You not look like it.
Back when I was that guy in the back of 

1546
01:08:58,071 --> 01:08:58,904
the skinny guy,
that's what I did and I got off really 

1547
01:09:01,131 --> 01:09:04,640
big into human performance about the 
body strength,

1548
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:05,090
fitness.

1549
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:07,130
That's what I wanted to be.
I wanted to be a hybrid motherfucker.

1550
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,353
I guy that can run 200 miles and then go
to the gym with your meathead who 

1551
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:13,880
doesn't even know who's scared of 
running it,

1552
01:09:13,881 --> 01:09:16,510
lift with him.
So that was my whole thing in life.

1553
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:17,353
I want to be the guy who can run to 
miles with the skinny guys and then go 

1554
01:09:19,971 --> 01:09:21,200
to the gym with the big meat heads and 
said,

1555
01:09:21,201 --> 01:09:22,940
okay,
loaded up,

1556
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:25,340
let's go.
So that was my whole thing.

1557
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:28,970
Who does a very difficult thing to,
to tie the two of them together.

1558
01:09:28,971 --> 01:09:32,410
When you think most people,
when you think ultra marathon runners or

1559
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,670
people that run long distances,
they're very thin,

1560
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:35,953
very thin guys.
Like when you were talking about the 

1561
01:09:37,581 --> 01:09:41,090
first time you ran 100 miles that you 
did dead lifts the night before.

1562
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:43,580
Like that is just fucking preposterous.

1563
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:44,740
Nobody does the.
No.

1564
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:45,583
Yeah.
So me and the guy talked about the book 

1565
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:50,630
a silverback gorilla is what I call them
in the book.

1566
01:09:50,631 --> 01:09:52,700
That's not his real name obviously,
but yeah,

1567
01:09:52,701 --> 01:09:54,830
he saw me go into my car the night 
before,

1568
01:09:54,831 --> 01:09:56,770
my first hundred mile race and it was 
like,

1569
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:57,980
he called me out,
said,

1570
01:09:57,981 --> 01:09:58,814
hey Goggins Kamir know when a navy seal 
cause y'all got to push you through 

1571
01:10:03,501 --> 01:10:04,430
three hell weeks.
She's like,

1572
01:10:04,431 --> 01:10:05,264
you know what?
Fuck I gotta go to the gym and lift 

1573
01:10:06,801 --> 01:10:08,570
heavy now.
So we're doing squats,

1574
01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:10,640
deadlifts,
power cleans,

1575
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:14,390
heavy bench presses.
And I'm thinking I have to run 100 miles

1576
01:10:14,391 --> 01:10:15,224
tomorrow.
But I also knew he was coming out there 

1577
01:10:17,721 --> 01:10:19,700
to watch me.
So I was like,

1578
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:22,520
know what?
You put me through three hell weeks.

1579
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:23,773
You were my instructor.
So now it's my turn to educate you on 

1580
01:10:27,111 --> 01:10:28,010
what a human can do.

1581
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,233
Can I know you can be sitting there 
thinking while you're watching me with 

1582
01:10:31,281 --> 01:10:32,114
your wife and your kid and he's worked 
out with the night before we went real 

1583
01:10:34,671 --> 01:10:37,680
heavy that the heaviest shit were sore.
Your team,

1584
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,550
you can sit there while you watched me 
run around this one mile track.

1585
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,400
How the fuck is he doing that shit right
now?

1586
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:44,713
We lifted heavy as hell and he's running
100 miles and never has been passed 20 

1587
01:10:48,651 --> 01:10:51,260
miles in his life.
I use that for a lot of fuel,

1588
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:54,740
so that gym workout,
Mr Silver back gorilla.

1589
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:59,030
There was a lot for my mentality that 
that brought with me.

1590
01:10:59,100 --> 01:10:59,933
I knew I would see you and he came at 
mile 50 with a package of six donuts 

1591
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:06,740
that I chopped up with the quickness.

1592
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:09,973
So yeah,
so I used that workout for a lot of 

1593
01:11:11,121 --> 01:11:12,410
motivation.
I knew he'd see me.

1594
01:11:12,411 --> 01:11:15,690
I know he'd be thinking advantage and 
not get Rhabdo that you know what?

1595
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:16,643
I don't know what I got that day,
but I talk about in the book again that 

1596
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,050
when I went home that night or that 
morning,

1597
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:29,160
that was single handedly nothing even 
close.

1598
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:32,850
I'm 43 years old now.
There's nothing even close to that pain.

1599
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:36,420
I knew for a fact I wasn't the guy that 
tub.

1600
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,810
I knew I.
I knew I was done it.

1601
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,830
I was talking about dehydrated,
known nutrition.

1602
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:44,640
I was eating Ritz crackers and mild 
plex.

1603
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:49,710
That was the worst pain I've ever 
experienced in my tire life.

1604
01:11:49,711 --> 01:11:52,230
I was pissing Coca Cola out of me.
It was,

1605
01:11:52,231 --> 01:11:54,060
it was bad.
It was bad.

1606
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:56,400
She probably did have rhabdo.
I guarantee it.

1607
01:11:56,670 --> 01:12:00,150
I guarantee I will have some bad calls 
us Coca Cola,

1608
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:01,760
no Bueno,
no Bueno.

1609
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:06,760
So it was bad and my ex wife was like,
she's,

1610
01:12:08,401 --> 01:12:09,234
you know,
she's a nurse and she called my mom up 

1611
01:12:11,131 --> 01:12:12,160
and mom had a,
her,

1612
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,380
her friend there was,
it was,

1613
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:15,180
it was a doctor friend of hers said,
Hey,

1614
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:17,230
you got to give them to doctor 
immediately.

1615
01:12:17,231 --> 01:12:17,701
And I was like,
okay,

1616
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:20,100
you gotta give me that fucking phone.
I got called up,

1617
01:12:20,101 --> 01:12:20,934
Chris Cosmin let him know I did 100 
miles so I can get in the badwater it 

1618
01:12:24,721 --> 01:12:25,710
didn't go as like,
you know,

1619
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,440
like I planned but I did get into 
badwater after another race,

1620
01:12:28,441 --> 01:12:31,860
but I'm putting you do a marathon,
like how later.

1621
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:36,920
So basically I had never run a marathon.
I did the hundred mile race first,

1622
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:37,973
no training,
but I had signed up for the marathon 

1623
01:12:40,111 --> 01:12:40,944
because it was a first last vegas 
marathon running down the strip of Las 

1624
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,370
Vegas.
So Las Vegas had a marathon.

1625
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:49,050
But it's the first time it's gonna go 
through the Strip.

1626
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:49,980
Two thousand five.
I'm like,

1627
01:12:49,981 --> 01:12:50,430
Hey,
I'm gonna.

1628
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:53,160
Sign up for it.
I went onto an Iraq.

1629
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:56,340
Did you know did the appointment.
When I come back I'll be training for it

1630
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:59,570
and I go do this race with my family.
Me and my ex wife.

1631
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,890
My mom signed up for it.
So in Iraq,

1632
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:06,900
me and my boy sledge in the book,
we're just working out.

1633
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:07,793
We're like,
we're doing crazy workouts in my cardio 

1634
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:14,670
was 20 minutes every Sunday on the 
elliptical trainer.

1635
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:16,013
That's the only cardio idea.
So I'll call myself training for a 

1636
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:20,243
marathon.
Right.

1637
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,170
So then,
you know,

1638
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,200
my,
my boys got killed in,

1639
01:13:24,201 --> 01:13:26,220
in the incident that happened on 
survivor,

1640
01:13:26,221 --> 01:13:28,080
you know,
the whole operation red wings.

1641
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:29,543
So that's what prompted me to do 100 
mile race after the 100 mile race in 

1642
01:13:32,791 --> 01:13:33,624
November.

1643
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:34,733
It was like two or three weeks later,
that marathon that we all signed up for 

1644
01:13:37,501 --> 01:13:38,334
that I didn't train for.
I didn't train for 100 mile race and 

1645
01:13:39,631 --> 01:13:41,550
didn't it off of this like,
Hey,

1646
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:44,940
I'll drive there with you all because I 
tried to run the day before,

1647
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:47,910
like I can't even run.
I can't run down the block.

1648
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:51,090
So I didn't do it.
So we were driving to the race.

1649
01:13:51,091 --> 01:13:51,810
I said,
hey mom,

1650
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:53,160
my mom's gonna walk it.
I said,

1651
01:13:53,161 --> 01:13:56,340
I'm going to walk it with you,
my ex wife.

1652
01:13:56,341 --> 01:13:57,510
I said,
you can go and take off,

1653
01:13:57,570 --> 01:14:00,300
do your thing,
run your race on walk my mom.

1654
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:05,850
That gun went off in some fucking 
happened.

1655
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:09,730
I took.
I was like,

1656
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,710
what?
I took up like a Jack Rabbit

1657
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:13,270
gone.
I was like,

1658
01:14:13,271 --> 01:14:15,780
what the hell?
So I remember I was thinking,

1659
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:16,600
I was like,
man,

1660
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:17,433
I couldn't.
I just run a hundred miles like three 

1661
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:19,654
weeks ago.
Like first time ever I was peeing blood 

1662
01:14:21,611 --> 01:14:24,670
and Pistons shitting on myself.
I got my body's broken,

1663
01:14:24,671 --> 01:14:25,090
my,
my,

1664
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:27,430
my Achilles and my tennis and my feet 
are broken.

1665
01:14:27,431 --> 01:14:28,990
I go,
what is this?

1666
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:32,080
It?
And every time I started running further

1667
01:14:32,081 --> 01:14:32,681
and frog,
okay,

1668
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:33,514
I got to the 10 K,
I'm a Boston marathon time because I 

1669
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:38,620
knew the Boston marathon was like three,
10,

1670
01:14:38,621 --> 01:14:40,240
59 for my age.
I'm like,

1671
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:41,673
hang on a second.
And then I started using all this 

1672
01:14:43,481 --> 01:14:45,280
external shit for motivation.
Like okay,

1673
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:47,890
who the fuck can go out here and run a 
hundred miles?

1674
01:14:47,891 --> 01:14:50,890
No training.
I'm broken most broken.

1675
01:14:50,891 --> 01:14:51,724
I've been in my life,
now I'm running a marathon who can do 

1676
01:14:53,351 --> 01:14:55,330
it?
So I started this feeding myself,

1677
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,193
feeding myself.

1678
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,890
I get to half a mile,
I'm about 30 seconds off the pace.

1679
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:01,090
I said,
hang on man,

1680
01:15:01,091 --> 01:15:03,280
you're goggins.
You can do this shit,

1681
01:15:03,281 --> 01:15:05,340
man.
I started this feeding myself,

1682
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,670
feeding myself,
feeding myself.

1683
01:15:06,671 --> 01:15:08,380
You can do this.
Before I knew it,

1684
01:15:08,381 --> 01:15:09,214
man,
I kept talking to like last six miles 

1685
01:15:11,471 --> 01:15:14,320
and I was off the pace and I just kicked
it and not necessarily new.

1686
01:15:14,321 --> 01:15:16,480
I did like a three.
Oh eight and change.

1687
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:19,030
I was like,
and that was what the fuck.

1688
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:22,060
What have I been leaving on the table?
Right.

1689
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:27,120
I've been leaving so much on the fucking
table for pain and that's when I started

1690
01:15:27,821 --> 01:15:31,810
like going crazy about the mind like 
what the hell am I?

1691
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:33,243
What is up?
Like it opened these different doors of 

1692
01:15:35,681 --> 01:15:39,580
like possibility.
Then like what is humanly possible?

1693
01:15:39,581 --> 01:15:41,620
What are we capable of like,
you know,

1694
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:43,810
people I didn't even know.

1695
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:44,643
I was just amazed by what I was able to 
do by a simple fact of just reasoning 

1696
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:50,703
and working with pain and pain 
management and in my mind is kept on 

1697
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,890
growing from there and it happened in 
hell.

1698
01:15:56,891 --> 01:15:58,780
Week it happened.
One hundred mile race happened here.

1699
01:15:58,781 --> 01:16:02,800
It started evolving into what it is now 
to where now I'm like,

1700
01:16:02,801 --> 01:16:03,311
God,
dog,

1701
01:16:03,311 --> 01:16:03,830
man,
the mind,

1702
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:06,400
we are leaving so much on the table when
people take me,

1703
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:08,980
he cusses so much.
She sounds crazy.

1704
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:10,990
Don't listen to all that Shit,
man.

1705
01:16:10,991 --> 01:16:14,620
Just this cut out the bullshit.
Cut the bullshit.

1706
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,570
Just get into the weeds of that.
You are.

1707
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:21,280
You are fucking yourself up by not 
examining your brain.

1708
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:24,010
You're not examining your brain 
messages.

1709
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:24,873
It that's done.
You examine your fucking brain and that 

1710
01:16:27,521 --> 01:16:30,850
takes some hard work and suffering.
If you're not going to do that.

1711
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:32,013
I'm sorry.
And it seems like there's no way to do 

1712
01:16:33,281 --> 01:16:34,620
that as a bystander.
No,

1713
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:35,950
you can't watch it,
man.

1714
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:37,840
You gotta get out there and be like,
oh,

1715
01:16:37,841 --> 01:16:40,210
this hurts.
This hurts real fucking bad.

1716
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:44,470
I don't think this is smart.
And then guess what happens?

1717
01:16:45,010 --> 01:16:49,510
The body will just,
it will adjust if it goes well.

1718
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,340
Then the next question again,
but it's,

1719
01:16:51,341 --> 01:16:54,100
you're a time when it doesn't adjust.

1720
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:59,530
I guess some of the stupidest shit man.
Like don't,

1721
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,990
don't take it with a grain of salt 
people.

1722
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,790
Those questions that people that are 
wanting to quit.

1723
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:04,624
Yes.
Yes.

1724
01:17:04,690 --> 01:17:06,010
And that's what I say.
When should I quit?

1725
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:07,730
Like a.
Did you ever like,

1726
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:09,230
feel like no,
shut the fuck up.

1727
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:11,450
Stop.
Stop.

1728
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:14,720
I don't want to like there's always that
next question.

1729
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,490
No,
don't take it.

1730
01:17:16,491 --> 01:17:19,250
Like go out there and run through a 
brick wall as many times as you can.

1731
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:21,290
No,
I'm not saying be me.

1732
01:17:21,291 --> 01:17:23,120
Don't run towards it and five miles at 
one time.

1733
01:17:23,121 --> 01:17:26,690
I'm not saying do that.
I'm saying start to learn.

1734
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:29,930
The mind is powerful.
It's powerful.

1735
01:17:29,931 --> 01:17:31,550
Man is unbelievable.

1736
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:32,773
But if people need,
they need a thing to get them going or 

1737
01:17:36,031 --> 01:17:37,280
they need a thing,
right?

1738
01:17:37,281 --> 01:17:39,310
I need a goal they need.
They need A.

1739
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:40,163
I'm like,
it's sometimes the first step is the 

1740
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:45,470
hardest.
Like it's hard to take that 1 million,

1741
01:17:45,471 --> 01:17:46,304
step two.
But sometimes the first step is the 

1742
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,130
something about the,
what do I do about it?

1743
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:54,800
They start going over the phone and 
start calling people.

1744
01:17:54,801 --> 01:17:59,801
They don't get out of the house and 
there's something about procrastination.

1745
01:18:01,641 --> 01:18:02,331
It's like,
you know,

1746
01:18:02,331 --> 01:18:04,910
it's painful.
You know you should be doing things,

1747
01:18:04,911 --> 01:18:07,190
but you just keep doing it.
You keep itching.

1748
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:12,040
I procrastinate like a motherfucker,
man.

1749
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:17,060
Every day I want to do this shit.
That's what's so funny,

1750
01:18:17,501 --> 01:18:18,334
man.
People looking like on some damn 

1751
01:18:18,761 --> 01:18:21,850
superhero that came down from the Gods,
from the heavens on earth.

1752
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:24,760
No Man,
I don't want to do this shit.

1753
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:31,870
I'm looking at my shoes for 30 minutes.
Sometimes they can fuck man.

1754
01:18:31,871 --> 01:18:32,704
People.
People look up to your Goggins fucked 

1755
01:18:34,631 --> 01:18:39,550
him.
Am I going to do this shit man.

1756
01:18:39,551 --> 01:18:40,990
But guess what,
you do it.

1757
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:44,310
I'm going to do it as long as you do it.
And that's what I know about math.

1758
01:18:44,910 --> 01:18:45,681
What I'm saying.
No Man,

1759
01:18:45,681 --> 01:18:47,780
you got to fucking sit here and you look
at your shoes for 30,

1760
01:18:47,781 --> 01:18:48,614
40 minutes you go,
you got to think about all day long you 

1761
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:53,780
go do it anyway.
And sometimes you don't have the time to

1762
01:18:53,781 --> 01:18:55,790
look at issues with 30 minutes.
Those are the,

1763
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:57,450
those are the beautiful days.
Yes.

1764
01:18:57,451 --> 01:18:57,981
It's,
you'd know,

1765
01:18:57,981 --> 01:18:59,390
you just have to go.
That's right.

1766
01:18:59,391 --> 01:19:01,610
And so like there's no room for 
procrastination.

1767
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,110
And that's when I,
when I was in the military,

1768
01:19:03,111 --> 01:19:06,140
I love my schedule because I knew it'd 
be at work at 7:00.

1769
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,840
So you better get your ass up at 4:00,
man.

1770
01:19:08,841 --> 01:19:12,080
He had get your shit and brother because
I had to get my shit and before I got my

1771
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:13,440
shit in,
you know.

1772
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:15,650
So that was my mentality back then,
man.

1773
01:19:15,651 --> 01:19:16,400
You know,
like I,

1774
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,790
I had to get the miles and get 
everything in man and,

1775
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:21,050
and get to work.

1776
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:23,450
Man.
I'm a competing with the Alpha males.

1777
01:19:23,770 --> 01:19:24,603
Yeah.
But how much does that piss other Alpha 

1778
01:19:26,091 --> 01:19:30,170
males off that you were imposing?
A very high bar.

1779
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,153
I,
I was very misunderstood human being 

1780
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:38,480
housed in the military.
The air force guys liked me a lot.

1781
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,810
The Rangers liked me a lot.
So much.

1782
01:19:41,811 --> 01:19:46,070
Not to seals because they were with you.
They didn't like me so much,

1783
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:47,210
which is fine,
you know,

1784
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:49,480
I respect them.
I think a lot of respect.

1785
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:49,770
I've,
I've,

1786
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:52,050
I've a lot of friends in the seal teams.
I got to like,

1787
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:55,310
like minded mentality as,
as me and wants to get me.

1788
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:58,010
I grew up and I got over it.
A lot of guys still have,

1789
01:19:58,011 --> 01:19:58,844
you know,
a lot of people can't get over the fact 

1790
01:20:00,171 --> 01:20:02,270
that whatever.
We're not became a civil recruiter.

1791
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:05,630
A lot of guys thought I wasn't deploying
for a lot of reasons and whatnot.

1792
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:07,710
And they,
I heard a lot.

1793
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:11,220
I was that guy who grinded.
I grind it hard.

1794
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:13,740
I mean I,
I grounded hard.

1795
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:18,090
I was that guy who was up,
like if we went on op or we had a,

1796
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,450
a workup,
let's say we had a workup.

1797
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:22,410
We're in Ireland,
were out there shooting guns and,

1798
01:20:22,411 --> 01:20:25,530
and dual land warfare and we did it to 
like 1:00

1799
01:20:25,531 --> 01:20:28,710
in the fucking morning.
Most everybody go to sleep,

1800
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,880
go to sleep.
I went to the gym,

1801
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,530
I worked out or our goal sleep that's 
going to be up at 5:00.

1802
01:20:37,531 --> 01:20:39,090
I was up at 4:00
and got my hour in.

1803
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:40,853
I made sure to always do that and I did 
it to a point to where I think at 

1804
01:20:44,911 --> 01:20:48,000
pissing people off because I want a 
quiet person about it.

1805
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:49,610
You know,
I,

1806
01:20:49,611 --> 01:20:50,444
I,
uh,

1807
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:52,830
I wasn't the most humble person.
I've always,

1808
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:53,670
you know.

1809
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:56,660
So when you're running alpha males,
um,

1810
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,980
you're sometimes picking a fight,
you know,

1811
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:00,960
all the time.
And I looked different,

1812
01:21:01,010 --> 01:21:02,400
acted different,
I was different.

1813
01:21:02,401 --> 01:21:04,080
I am different.
I take a lot of pride in that.

1814
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:05,520
And so,
you know,

1815
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,050
if,
if you didn't get after it,

1816
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:10,140
I didn't respect you because I believe 
that,

1817
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,180
you know,
where I'm at,

1818
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:15,390
I know that human potential is what we 
have.

1819
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:19,110
So all we have is what we,
the world sees us a certain way.

1820
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,500
And when I saw that people weren't doing
that,

1821
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:27,240
I had a funky ass fucking attitude and I
own it in my book.

1822
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:29,940
I come back from ranger school,
a big time leader.

1823
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,700
I was a big time fucking leader.
Get honor man out there.

1824
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:33,983
I lead by example.
And when I realized a lot of times when 

1825
01:21:36,631 --> 01:21:39,060
you're in these schools,
these schools,

1826
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:41,670
people want to graduate these schools 
because they suck.

1827
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:43,950
They don't want to ever go back to these
schools.

1828
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,433
Those schools became my fucking life.
People don't want to see a fucking God 

1829
01:21:50,551 --> 01:21:52,500
that wants to go back to day one,
week one,

1830
01:21:52,501 --> 01:21:55,200
a fucking navy seal training every 
fucking day of your life.

1831
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:59,400
And that's how I live.
And it's a disgusting human being.

1832
01:21:59,401 --> 01:22:00,234
I can be.

1833
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:02,903
It is.
And a lot of people didn't like me a 

1834
01:22:04,171 --> 01:22:05,004
lot.
A lot of fucking people started some 

1835
01:22:05,641 --> 01:22:07,530
stupid shit and started saying this and 
that.

1836
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,810
Bottom line,
man is my fucking resume.

1837
01:22:09,811 --> 01:22:12,420
Says it all man.
My resumes out there,

1838
01:22:12,421 --> 01:22:13,254
Google is a motherfucker.
You say whatever you want to say about 

1839
01:22:14,701 --> 01:22:15,534
me,
man,

1840
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:17,430
I,
I miss some deployments,

1841
01:22:17,431 --> 01:22:18,540
man,
for having fucking,

1842
01:22:18,541 --> 01:22:19,374
you know,
two heart surgeries and people try to 

1843
01:22:21,071 --> 01:22:22,230
start some rumors.
Shit on me,

1844
01:22:22,231 --> 01:22:23,700
man.
You started reimbursing on me man,

1845
01:22:23,701 --> 01:22:24,534
because I fucking got the fuck after it 
real hard guys like a guy named Hawk I 

1846
01:22:28,381 --> 01:22:30,500
talked to all time.
Yay.

1847
01:22:30,690 --> 01:22:31,523
He's a great friend of mine.
When the horseman first before my heart 

1848
01:22:34,261 --> 01:22:35,220
surgery,
my second heart surgery,

1849
01:22:35,221 --> 01:22:37,350
I'm going to 10 mile ruck run for my 
second highest rate.

1850
01:22:37,351 --> 01:22:38,184
The day of it,
I'm going to attend mile record and 50 

1851
01:22:39,901 --> 01:22:40,734
pounds.

1852
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:42,090
I saw that guy.
He's like,

1853
01:22:42,091 --> 01:22:44,160
what the fuck are you doing out here?
We get a heart surgeon.

1854
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:45,173
It's Roger that brother I'm getting in 
before I'm be out for about six months 

1855
01:22:47,971 --> 01:22:48,804
after the heart surgery.
That was my mentality because I started 

1856
01:22:50,911 --> 01:22:51,744
realizing that a young age we'd always 
leaving on the table and once I found 

1857
01:22:55,411 --> 01:22:59,400
out what a human beings capable of,
I didn't know how to control that.

1858
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:01,103
I was,
I was a fucking talking about fucking 

1859
01:23:02,731 --> 01:23:04,520
savage.
That's what I was.

1860
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:06,490
I was a fucking straight up people's 
talking about savage.

1861
01:23:06,491 --> 01:23:11,410
Very likely I was fucking from the back 
woods motherfucking savage dude,

1862
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,360
you know,
and I just,

1863
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:14,440
I was just,
I was,

1864
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:18,970
I told you what I thought I had it.
I ate chips on my shoulder,

1865
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:23,410
I m and a lot of times that wasn't 
great.

1866
01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:26,260
So is it a situation where like with the
seals were,

1867
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:29,490
once you've gotten through buds and once
you've gotten through all the,

1868
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:34,540
the physically grueling parts of getting
to be accepted once you're in,

1869
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:39,670
then you were imposing standards that 
they didn't want to,

1870
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:41,290
didn't want to keep up with.

1871
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,170
I will say some people,
you know,

1872
01:23:43,171 --> 01:23:44,170
I,
I had uh,

1873
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:46,030
I had one platoon that had a problem 
with,

1874
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:47,170
you know,
like I,

1875
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:48,271
like I,
I,

1876
01:23:48,271 --> 01:23:49,104
I graduated ranger school and I got in 
this platoon and I didn't see how the 

1877
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:54,700
hockey,
I wasn't charged with pt program and you

1878
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:57,100
put me in charge,
the PT program is fucking your ass.

1879
01:23:57,970 --> 01:23:59,890
And the thing about is I didn't like it 
either.

1880
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,960
I didn't want to do this shit either 
man.

1881
01:24:01,961 --> 01:24:03,630
But what were you making them do?
Like,

1882
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:04,331
you know,
like I,

1883
01:24:04,331 --> 01:24:05,710
it was,
it was some navy,

1884
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:07,240
it was some bullshit,
you know,

1885
01:24:07,241 --> 01:24:08,470
we went back to buzz like,
you know,

1886
01:24:08,471 --> 01:24:11,170
log pts and you're carrying logs,
the berms and shit.

1887
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:14,890
And like I'd had us do like pull ups,
rope climbs,

1888
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:18,910
pull up like flat out fucking hour.
So imagine him doing rope climb,

1889
01:24:18,911 --> 01:24:20,980
then go and do like 10 to 15 pull ups 
coming back.

1890
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:24,740
And we would do like these if they were 
very hard workout.

1891
01:24:24,770 --> 01:24:26,890
Like there was no,
like go to the gym,

1892
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:27,933
lifting some weights type of shit.
And I was imposing my own mentality on 

1893
01:24:33,161 --> 01:24:35,290
everybody.
These are grown ass fucking man.

1894
01:24:35,291 --> 01:24:35,740
They ain't no,
you know,

1895
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:38,350
they don't want to be with.
I'm trying to make them to be.

1896
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:41,440
And when they called me off like,
Hey,

1897
01:24:41,441 --> 01:24:42,900
you know,
we're not silly.

1898
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:44,680
We were not in buds anymore.
Goggins.

1899
01:24:44,681 --> 01:24:48,220
It pissed me off and I uh,
and I get a little fucking attitude.

1900
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:48,840
Got,
got my.

1901
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:49,673
And I got my ball and meet me and sledge
went ahead and started to a workout 

1902
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:57,070
together and we developed this like me 
and sledge workout,

1903
01:24:57,071 --> 01:24:59,590
like fucking random.
And we had this fucking mentality of,

1904
01:24:59,591 --> 01:25:00,424
fuck yeah,
ever getting nasty with every day and 

1905
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:04,000
everybody's kind of did their own thing,
man.

1906
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:07,090
And I just,
that's when I started looking at people,

1907
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,100
you know,
not just people very differently man,

1908
01:25:09,101 --> 01:25:11,740
because I've been in to like,
you know,

1909
01:25:11,741 --> 01:25:13,810
like to be this special opera.
You got bb,

1910
01:25:13,811 --> 01:25:16,450
I have broken legs and these guys,
all those stories.

1911
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:17,920
I was the same guy,
man.

1912
01:25:17,921 --> 01:25:19,900
I,
I put people on a pedestal.

1913
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:24,490
I put people like I can never be there.
I could never be that guy,

1914
01:25:24,491 --> 01:25:26,260
man.
Never put anybody on a pedestal.

1915
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,150
That's what happened to me.
I put them on a pass.

1916
01:25:28,151 --> 01:25:31,030
Then once I got out there with them and 
I saw him and he wants to get.

1917
01:25:31,031 --> 01:25:31,864
Not everybody,
some hard motherfuckers out there do 

1918
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:38,680
period dot hard motherfuckers.
I thought every motherfucker was hard.

1919
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:41,230
Yay.
Yay.

1920
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:45,310
Uncommon amongst uncommon man.
That's all it was about for me,

1921
01:25:45,311 --> 01:25:46,144
man.
And I took it to another level and I 

1922
01:25:47,531 --> 01:25:48,364
pissed a lot of motherfuckers off and 
they were trying to find chinks in my 

1923
01:25:51,221 --> 01:25:51,580
armor.

1924
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:52,413
Then they were there.
They were trying to find chinks in the 

1925
01:25:54,051 --> 01:25:55,360
armor,
you know,

1926
01:25:55,361 --> 01:25:58,120
all he does is run.
All he does is fucking run.

1927
01:25:58,870 --> 01:25:59,703
That's why,
you know.

1928
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:00,573
But once again,
that's what I'm talk about the military 

1929
01:26:01,391 --> 01:26:02,770
too much.
Like I said,

1930
01:26:02,771 --> 01:26:05,390
the Air Force love me.
The army guys I work with,

1931
01:26:05,391 --> 01:26:06,470
love me,
the ranger school,

1932
01:26:06,471 --> 01:26:09,170
all that stuff love me and I wasn't,
you know,

1933
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:11,060
it is what it is,
man.

1934
01:26:11,061 --> 01:26:14,480
It's A.
I was part of the navy seals I was at.

1935
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:19,340
I was a team guy but I wasn't part of 
the Brotherhood and that's just me,

1936
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:20,540
man.
That's just me.

1937
01:26:20,650 --> 01:26:21,483
It ain't say nothing bad about them.
I got a lot of love for a lot of them 

1938
01:26:24,730 --> 01:26:27,770
rather than I'm ain't got love for me.
Bank talk bad about them.

1939
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:32,480
It's just I'm different and definitely I
figured out I'm different from everybody

1940
01:26:32,481 --> 01:26:35,870
in the fucking world and I had to own 
that and say,

1941
01:26:35,871 --> 01:26:38,120
you know what man?
You made a lot of fucking mistakes being

1942
01:26:38,350 --> 01:26:42,110
a being who you are.
And I should've been more of a leader at

1943
01:26:42,111 --> 01:26:42,944
times,
but a lot of times a lot of people 

1944
01:26:44,031 --> 01:26:45,170
should have been a little bit harder to.

1945
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:46,553
So was it that some of those guys just 
didn't want to work as hard or was it 

1946
01:26:49,291 --> 01:26:50,124
just that they were,
they weren't appreciating how 

1947
01:26:51,361 --> 01:26:54,090
competitive you were,
you were always against them.

1948
01:26:54,270 --> 01:26:55,103
Is that what it was that he did it 
foster the sense of brotherhood because 

1949
01:26:58,111 --> 01:26:59,550
you are more like,
come on pussy.

1950
01:27:00,430 --> 01:27:03,980
I didn't really call them pussies,
but you can look on my face and I looked

1951
01:27:03,981 --> 01:27:05,550
at you and in,
you know,

1952
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:06,830
you can,
you can kind of say this,

1953
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:08,060
you know,
so what happens?

1954
01:27:08,070 --> 01:27:08,903
I started developing this,
like the separation in our thing about 

1955
01:27:12,261 --> 01:27:13,850
me to mass.
I don't go out,

1956
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,390
I don't party.
I don't hang out with the guys.

1957
01:27:17,391 --> 01:27:18,081
I don't,
you know.

1958
01:27:18,081 --> 01:27:21,680
So I was always forming this kind of 
separation.

1959
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,380
I'm a big time introvert,
you know,

1960
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:27,740
I do my job and I don't want to see your
fucking ass again.

1961
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:30,620
I'm gonna go home refreshed and we'll 
see you again.

1962
01:27:30,621 --> 01:27:30,881
You know,
you're,

1963
01:27:30,881 --> 01:27:33,320
you're in a platoon with these guys for 
two years,

1964
01:27:33,321 --> 01:27:35,840
sometimes a year and a half and I would,
you know,

1965
01:27:35,841 --> 01:27:38,090
we work up,
do our shit and I just,

1966
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:41,480
I was just a different fucking cat.
I'm a different cat man.

1967
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,313
Like I,
uh,

1968
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:44,090
you know,
I just,

1969
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:47,300
I think differently,
I believe differently.

1970
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:50,840
Um,
and I believe strongly in what I believe

1971
01:27:50,841 --> 01:27:51,674
in,
when some people must appreciate the 

1972
01:27:52,791 --> 01:27:56,060
fact that you self motivated and that 
you were pushing the envelope,

1973
01:27:56,090 --> 01:27:58,730
that you were pushing the pace you were 
setting a high bar.

1974
01:27:58,760 --> 01:27:59,593
Yeah.
I have a lot of guys right now within 

1975
01:28:00,741 --> 01:28:02,140
the community.
A lot of,

1976
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:03,380
a lot of guys.
Once again,

1977
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:07,220
this is like,
it's like a big soap opera sometimes,

1978
01:28:07,221 --> 01:28:07,660
man,
when,

1979
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:08,930
you know,
when we,

1980
01:28:09,010 --> 01:28:11,540
when unit fraternity like that,
that's where it's like,

1981
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:14,480
man.
So I had to get different vantage point,

1982
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:15,740
look at it and see that,
you know,

1983
01:28:15,741 --> 01:28:18,830
a lot of guys did respect who I was and 
what I did.

1984
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:20,250
And um,
I,

1985
01:28:20,470 --> 01:28:23,330
I brought it fucking hard a lot in 
everyday,

1986
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:27,740
but I also rubbed people the wrong way.
I'm like,

1987
01:28:27,741 --> 01:28:31,820
that shit you talking about.
I'm like that if you want to scratch the

1988
01:28:31,821 --> 01:28:34,530
fuck out my ass.
And you're like,

1989
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:35,750
fuck this dude,
man.

1990
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:40,240
I love what you talked about when you 
ran the marathon.

1991
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:43,940
You realized how much you were leaving 
on the table because that is um,

1992
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,780
I mean,
I think the,

1993
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:50,090
the unfulfilled potentials,
the story of most people's lives.

1994
01:28:50,610 --> 01:28:51,980
It is,
it is.

1995
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:53,093
It could have been the story of mine and
I tell a lot of people who can people 

1996
01:28:55,641 --> 01:28:57,170
go,
what's your biggest fear in life?

1997
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:03,010
And my biggest fear honestly was let's 
say this.

1998
01:29:03,011 --> 01:29:03,844
I say,
I don't care if you believe in God or 

1999
01:29:04,891 --> 01:29:05,550
not.
I don't care.

2000
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:07,230
So this is play game with me.
Let's say,

2001
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:11,850
let's say your God and we have a big 
fucking long line of people.

2002
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:14,700
And I made the heaven 75 years old.
I'm 300 pounds.

2003
01:29:14,701 --> 01:29:15,534
I made the heavens.
I worked for Ecolab my entire life 

2004
01:29:17,611 --> 01:29:19,380
spraying for cockroaches.
That's what I did.

2005
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:21,540
But I'm dead.
I'm in heaven now.

2006
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:24,390
And you are at your.
You're judging us all now.

2007
01:29:25,170 --> 01:29:27,330
So we're in line raw,
sitting there in line,

2008
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:32,610
you have Adam Brown,
here's a big board up and you're talking

2009
01:29:32,611 --> 01:29:36,960
to Adam Brown about his life and you rip
it down and I'm next in line,

2010
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:40,290
David Goggins,
I see my name and I see all this shit.

2011
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:41,124
And God goes,
Hey,

2012
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:46,250
you say read this man now reading this 
list and I'm seeing and 82 pounds,

2013
01:29:48,270 --> 01:29:50,220
navy seal,
ranger school,

2014
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:53,850
motivational speaker,
changing minds.

2015
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,150
Okay,
may I pull up record all this shit?

2016
01:29:57,860 --> 01:29:59,910
And I'm like,
that's not me man.

2017
01:30:00,610 --> 01:30:03,660
And God looks at me and says that's who 
you were supposed to be.

2018
01:30:05,070 --> 01:30:06,800
And my biggest fear,
I,

2019
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:07,813
I visualize some crazy shit.
My biggest fear is that one day I'm 

2020
01:30:10,861 --> 01:30:11,694
going to reach a judgment of my life.
Someone something is going to judge me 

2021
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:17,160
for what the fuck I was supposed to be 
in life.

2022
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:21,780
And what I want now is that whoever's 
judgment,

2023
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:22,633
whatever judged me up there,
I want them to have a board and them up 

2024
01:30:26,221 --> 01:30:27,054
there right now getting their pin out.
Cause know this person who judges 

2025
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:31,583
supposed to know everything.
Supposed to know from the time your dad 

2026
01:30:33,201 --> 01:30:34,040
at the time you're,
you know,

2027
01:30:34,410 --> 01:30:35,243
Tommy boy did.
I want this person to be like this up 

2028
01:30:38,101 --> 01:30:38,521
there.
Right?

2029
01:30:38,521 --> 01:30:39,750
More about me.
St.

2030
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:40,320
Fuck.
I know.

2031
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:40,800
I know.

2032
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:43,260
He can do that.
I can do that.

2033
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:48,060
So I want to impress whatever the fuck 
is up there.

2034
01:30:48,061 --> 01:30:48,894
Whatever's going on in life.
I want to go up there and not have 

2035
01:30:50,701 --> 01:30:52,950
anything left on the table.
I want to.

2036
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:58,040
I want to drain my soul every fucking 
bit of person I am now.

2037
01:30:58,711 --> 01:31:01,710
How do you plan on doing that,
but going forward in the future,

2038
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,120
do you have a plan?
Yeah.

2039
01:31:03,121 --> 01:31:05,850
So where I did not,
I believe in going back to scratch.

2040
01:31:06,810 --> 01:31:08,850
So a lot of us,
like right now I've.

2041
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,540
I've come a long way in my life.
I've,

2042
01:31:10,550 --> 01:31:11,383
I've had to grow up a lot except a lot 
of the fucking things I've done in my 

2043
01:31:13,591 --> 01:31:14,640
life.
I'd accept a lot.

2044
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:17,460
I took all this information,
big database,

2045
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:18,593
took it all.
So what got me to be where I'm at today 

2046
01:31:20,881 --> 01:31:23,670
is data.
I collect even more data now,

2047
01:31:23,671 --> 01:31:25,350
which where I can write this book was I 
can tell people,

2048
01:31:25,351 --> 01:31:26,670
hey,
you know,

2049
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:28,050
I fucking have a lot of faults.

2050
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:29,153
I have other mentality that can 
sometimes rub people the wrong all this 

2051
01:31:31,201 --> 01:31:33,480
shit.
So how you get better is.

2052
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,510
So right now I'm way up here now.
I was way down here,

2053
01:31:37,290 --> 01:31:41,010
but what makes you way up here is being 
from way down here.

2054
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:43,430
So I love going back.
I call it.

2055
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:45,570
So when I was growing up like three 
years,

2056
01:31:45,790 --> 01:31:48,330
so from the time I was eight to tell 
them I was like 12.

2057
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:52,410
We lived in a $7 a month place in what I
call it is.

2058
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:57,440
I'm always paying rent in that $7 a 
month home everyday of my life.

2059
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:02,710
I go back and revisit that place because
that place made me this garanimals.

2060
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:04,053
That place made me this hard man in 
there from that place or that place is 

2061
01:32:07,571 --> 01:32:08,404
hard work.
I places going back to the fundamentals 

2062
01:32:11,021 --> 01:32:12,670
of life,
the fundamentals.

2063
01:32:12,671 --> 01:32:13,504
What made David Goggins,
David Goggins going back in and you're 

2064
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:16,063
going back to the,
going back to the library of David 

2065
01:32:18,610 --> 01:32:20,620
Goggins studying even more than we are.
No.

2066
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:21,783
Taking that out.
Going back to where I'm at now and then 

2067
01:32:23,681 --> 01:32:24,514
moving forward.
So I believe in always taking steps 

2068
01:32:26,651 --> 01:32:28,360
backwards to your roots.
We,

2069
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:29,283
we cannot forget the roots and what made
us the grandmother we can ever become 

2070
01:32:32,930 --> 01:32:33,763
civilized.
Isn't a grandmother like little kids 

2071
01:32:35,081 --> 01:32:36,330
clothes,
this little kids clothes.

2072
01:32:36,331 --> 01:32:39,670
But I love the word I love is closer 
drinks.

2073
01:32:42,210 --> 01:32:44,350
It was closer drinks members,
something like that.

2074
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:46,660
So when,
when you,

2075
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:47,913
when you live in like right now,
like what kind of goals are you setting 

2076
01:32:50,951 --> 01:32:51,850
and how,
how are you,

2077
01:32:51,910 --> 01:32:54,370
how are you,
how are you feeding that beast inside of

2078
01:32:54,371 --> 01:32:56,320
you?
How you calming all that down.

2079
01:32:57,070 --> 01:32:58,960
Stretching helped a lot,
you know,

2080
01:32:58,961 --> 01:33:01,630
so when you wire yourself up so much 
yoga,

2081
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:04,630
yoga and stretching has really helped me
to like,

2082
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:08,410
you want to be quiet in your mind to see
what you want to go.

2083
01:33:08,411 --> 01:33:12,460
Because noise is the ultimate Kryptonite
down.

2084
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:13,353
Too much noise in your mind.
You're not going to be focused on what 

2085
01:33:15,341 --> 01:33:16,174
the task at hand is.
That's one thing that I've found that 

2086
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:20,480
like long cardio,
so the best thing ever for harmon.

2087
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:21,760
That noise?
Yes.

2088
01:33:21,850 --> 01:33:22,683
We all talked about that.
All the guys that I did that sober 

2089
01:33:24,101 --> 01:33:24,934
October thing with a fitness challenge 
that like if you work out five hours a 

2090
01:33:27,581 --> 01:33:28,990
day,
you don't give a fuck.

2091
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:29,883
No,
it's.

2092
01:33:29,890 --> 01:33:31,840
It's amazing.
I might give you could take that and put

2093
01:33:31,841 --> 01:33:32,674
it in a pill form.
How you feel about life after you work 

2094
01:33:35,501 --> 01:33:37,750
out five hours.
We don't give a fuck.

2095
01:33:37,751 --> 01:33:38,940
Nothing bothers you.
Like nothing.

2096
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,830
You nothing because you've struggled.
True.

2097
01:33:41,890 --> 01:33:43,360
My fiance right now,
it's like,

2098
01:33:43,361 --> 01:33:44,650
hey,
I got x,

2099
01:33:44,651 --> 01:33:47,050
Y andZ and like I'll take you.
She's like,

2100
01:33:47,051 --> 01:33:48,280
what you want?
Look at shoes.

2101
01:33:48,281 --> 01:33:49,950
I'll take you one.
I'm like,

2102
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:52,090
I just worked out for four hours,
man.

2103
01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:55,550
I fucking sit down this motherfucker 
chair all day long and son.

2104
01:33:56,030 --> 01:33:56,950
Yeah,
I'm chill.

2105
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,740
It's different.
I get all that shit out.

2106
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:04,030
I ring the rag out in the morning time 
and whatever you want to do.

2107
01:34:04,450 --> 01:34:06,760
I'm here man.
Most people never get there though.

2108
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:08,440
No,
they always have that chatter.

2109
01:34:08,510 --> 01:34:10,890
Always,
always this negative anger.

2110
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:14,450
The guy cut you off yesterday at your 
head.

2111
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:15,670
Yep.
All Day Long,

2112
01:34:15,671 --> 01:34:16,600
man.
Chatter,

2113
01:34:16,660 --> 01:34:17,650
chatter,
chatter.

2114
01:34:17,651 --> 01:34:19,150
Maybe I should do this.
Maybe I should've done that.

2115
01:34:19,151 --> 01:34:21,420
I should've never let that guy get away 
with that exact.

2116
01:34:21,450 --> 01:34:23,290
Should have done this.
I should have taken that job.

2117
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:25,930
I should have moved.
I should've stuck with her.

2118
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:29,170
That was me,
man.

2119
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:31,180
People.
Yeah.

2120
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:33,760
People like me.
I was amazing that,

2121
01:34:33,761 --> 01:34:36,410
that long cardio.
Just calm that chatter like that.

2122
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:38,033
I'd never until October.
I'd never really done long cardio 

2123
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:45,750
everyday it beat that testosterone up 
man beats everything on that test.

2124
01:34:45,870 --> 01:34:47,140
You're like,
fucking done.

2125
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:49,450
You're cool.
You're cool man.

2126
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,460
It's not just that.
It's like it's.

2127
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:56,050
I was talking about people's brains that
I think that the way people's minds work

2128
01:34:56,051 --> 01:34:58,090
that you were like a battery.
That's like

2129
01:34:58,370 --> 01:34:59,203
leaking out.
Like since we don't use it because we 

2130
01:35:01,641 --> 01:35:02,474
have all this potential,
we don't use it like oozes off the top 

2131
01:35:05,751 --> 01:35:07,510
of the battery and it gets messy.
Right?

2132
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:10,070
It's going down the size of the battery.
It's all fucked up,

2133
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:15,110
but when you just drain that bitch like 
nature intended,

2134
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:18,920
like give you the potential to run away 
from predators,

2135
01:35:18,921 --> 01:35:19,754
avoid invading tribes and to fight and 
to gather and hunt and all the physical 

2136
01:35:26,151 --> 01:35:30,800
potential that your body is capable of.
When you do drain it with like a 10 mile

2137
01:35:30,801 --> 01:35:33,950
run or long cardio session,
long workout session,

2138
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:35,810
then you can just be you.

2139
01:35:35,970 --> 01:35:38,070
It's the great purge man.
The purge,

2140
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:39,480
the purge,
you prayers,

2141
01:35:39,481 --> 01:35:41,120
all that fucking demon shit out,
man.

2142
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:44,430
All the evil evil can't stand a 10 mile 
run,

2143
01:35:44,431 --> 01:35:45,840
bro.
Get leaked.

2144
01:35:45,841 --> 01:35:48,300
Right?
The fuck out gets pounded out.

2145
01:35:48,301 --> 01:35:49,134
Pounded out.
Yeah,

2146
01:35:49,390 --> 01:35:53,890
but you can see things more clearly and 
that is only available through effort.

2147
01:35:53,891 --> 01:35:55,870
I mean,
maybe it's available through meditation.

2148
01:35:55,990 --> 01:35:56,823
I don't know,
but I feel like there's a different 

2149
01:35:58,211 --> 01:35:59,044
thing that's available through effort 
because there's also a satisfaction of 

2150
01:36:01,031 --> 01:36:01,864
accomplishment.

2151
01:36:01,890 --> 01:36:03,160
Oh yeah.
Efforts.

2152
01:36:03,161 --> 01:36:05,490
Huge man.
It means everything gets.

2153
01:36:05,550 --> 01:36:07,810
You got to feel good about yourself.
Now what do you do?

2154
01:36:07,811 --> 01:36:10,990
You plan out your future?
I do,

2155
01:36:11,110 --> 01:36:14,230
so I'm very goal,
so I had that Accountability Mirror,

2156
01:36:14,290 --> 01:36:17,020
but also plan on all my small,
big time,

2157
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:18,400
you know,
medium goals.

2158
01:36:18,401 --> 01:36:21,460
All these things have to do in life.
I'm a big planner.

2159
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:24,340
I'm a big planner,
so you know,

2160
01:36:24,341 --> 01:36:28,330
right now I'm going back to scratch so 
I'm trying to be wild land firefighter,

2161
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:30,160
you know,
I did that for a couple of seasons.

2162
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:31,420
You're going to do that now.
Yeah.

2163
01:36:31,421 --> 01:36:34,380
So I did it for,
I did it for two full seasons,

2164
01:36:34,870 --> 01:36:35,703
two half seasons,
so this year was my second year doing 

2165
01:36:37,331 --> 01:36:38,470
it.
I had to,

2166
01:36:38,590 --> 01:36:39,423
I had to stop about two months before it
ended because this book to start 

2167
01:36:44,501 --> 01:36:46,270
promoting the book and start finishing 
the book up,

2168
01:36:46,271 --> 01:36:47,650
but I've been doing an opportunity.

2169
01:36:47,650 --> 01:36:48,910
That's some fucking work,
man.

2170
01:36:49,390 --> 01:36:52,450
Those fucking guys get asked.
What made you decide to do that?

2171
01:36:53,410 --> 01:36:54,520
The work,
you know,

2172
01:36:54,521 --> 01:36:57,500
like when your hands stopped becoming 
really catalyst,

2173
01:36:58,290 --> 01:37:00,500
it's doesn't get back to work.
You know,

2174
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:03,340
like I retired from the military.
I did 21 years in the military.

2175
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:06,850
The military wasn't my life.
Loved everything about it,

2176
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:07,863
the discipline of it.
There's some about going back into the 

2177
01:37:12,041 --> 01:37:14,290
money you make is nil.
It's not about the money at all.

2178
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:15,693
It's just about the hard work.
I've always been looking for those 

2179
01:37:18,071 --> 01:37:18,904
people like those guys.
Like you're out there digging a three 

2180
01:37:21,311 --> 01:37:24,640
mile fireline,
literally a three mile fireline.

2181
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:25,713
You're cutting down,
he's fucking shoes as trees dig this 

2182
01:37:27,221 --> 01:37:32,221
fire line and the fire line is like 20 
to 18 inches for for three miles and you

2183
01:37:33,201 --> 01:37:36,930
got like fucking 12 people digging this 
shit and I'm either thinking about this,

2184
01:37:36,940 --> 01:37:37,773
some of the hardest fucking work I've 
done in my life and it's that challenge 

2185
01:37:41,171 --> 01:37:42,004
that you can't find sometimes by going 
to the gym or by running 100 mile race 

2186
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:48,550
if that,
if that new challenge of like,

2187
01:37:48,551 --> 01:37:50,110
Hey,
and you get done digging.

2188
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:53,100
All right,
you've worked 17 hour,

2189
01:37:53,101 --> 01:37:54,280
16,
17 hours.

2190
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:59,160
You get your fucking little fucking 
sleep mat out shack down,

2191
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:00,083
boom,
right on the floor right there on the 

2192
01:38:01,171 --> 01:38:02,004
ground.
Get up,

2193
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:03,980
dig some more.
You know,

2194
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,040
be out there two,
three weeks.

2195
01:38:05,041 --> 01:38:05,874
Sometimes man has doing this shit and 
there's great satisfaction in the kind 

2196
01:38:07,921 --> 01:38:10,530
of work that you do out there.
No one's watching.

2197
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:12,960
No one gives a fuck.
It's hard.

2198
01:38:12,961 --> 01:38:16,680
Dangerous work and you know,
you're doing it to help shit out man.

2199
01:38:16,770 --> 01:38:18,480
You know,
how did you get drawn into that?

2200
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:19,973
So I got drawn into it because I was 
always looking for the next challenge 

2201
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:23,633
and I was like,
what is there after the military with 

2202
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:27,210
like,
what the fuck is there man?

2203
01:38:27,710 --> 01:38:30,870
I'm 43,
I'm getting back in shape,

2204
01:38:30,871 --> 01:38:31,704
you know,
I'm fucking getting these health issues 

2205
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:35,400
taken care of that I had and I started 
once again,

2206
01:38:35,401 --> 01:38:36,540
Google's amazing shit.

2207
01:38:37,290 --> 01:38:38,700
Hardcore fucking jobs.
No,

2208
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:39,400
pretty much,
you know,

2209
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:40,260
hard,
hard ass.

2210
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:42,140
Fucking found the horse,
you know,

2211
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:45,330
like the first race,
no hardest races in the world.

2212
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:46,733
So basically I started to find this wild
land firefighter and wildland 

2213
01:38:50,190 --> 01:38:51,023
firefighting.
So our google nest ask Google a smoke 

2214
01:38:52,851 --> 01:38:54,150
jumpers,
you know,

2215
01:38:54,151 --> 01:38:56,440
I'm like,
what the fuck these guys do what?

2216
01:38:56,820 --> 01:38:59,700
They jump out of planes and attack small
fires.

2217
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:01,910
Like that's the shit.
So I'm like okay,

2218
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,360
okay,
we can put down a list.

2219
01:39:03,361 --> 01:39:04,590
And okay,
hot shots,

2220
01:39:04,630 --> 01:39:09,630
it was a hot shot dude that go out with 
big fires and they dig fire line.

2221
01:39:10,430 --> 01:39:13,530
I'm like fuck.
With the video of it,

2222
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:16,080
like that shit looks like it's sucks.
It's hot,

2223
01:39:16,470 --> 01:39:18,570
you know,
you're out there on your own.

2224
01:39:19,170 --> 01:39:19,820
I mean,
you know,

2225
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:21,580
you're out there on your own man.
Just fire lands.

2226
01:39:21,590 --> 01:39:22,590
So that's Kinda how I found it.

2227
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:24,570
I'm always looking for the next 
challenge.

2228
01:39:25,210 --> 01:39:28,500
I'm never satisfied with,
oh I did that.

2229
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:29,640
Like,
you know,

2230
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:32,070
I became a seal.
I was an air force guy,

2231
01:39:32,071 --> 01:39:33,720
became a seal.
I went to ranger school,

2232
01:39:33,721 --> 01:39:36,090
I tried out for Delta Force twice,
you know,

2233
01:39:36,091 --> 01:39:36,521
like,
um,

2234
01:39:36,521 --> 01:39:37,354
I'm always looking for what is next,
looking for those uncommon men and 

2235
01:39:41,371 --> 01:39:43,620
women,
uncommon people because I'm trying to,

2236
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:46,410
I'm trying to grow,
I'm trying to grow.

2237
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:47,813
And a lot of times you know,
you won't be the one person that's 

2238
01:39:49,081 --> 01:39:50,970
making yourself grow.
You looking for those.

2239
01:39:50,971 --> 01:39:53,070
Cameron Hanes is those Joe Rogan,
those people who are like,

2240
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:54,233
just different people who understand 
what the fuck you're saying because a 

2241
01:39:56,521 --> 01:39:59,850
lot of things I had to say,
I can't save them all.

2242
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:02,940
I can't say the more,
you may not understand them,

2243
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:06,240
so I had to really find a way to 
communicate with people.

2244
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:07,800
So the only thing,
oh my God,

2245
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:11,840
what did you just say?
So these Cameron Hanes is these jewelry,

2246
01:40:11,850 --> 01:40:14,280
these people get it.
So I go to those little,

2247
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:17,490
those little nucleus spots,
get a little more strength,

2248
01:40:17,550 --> 01:40:19,380
a little more knowledge.
Gilbert tools,

2249
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:24,430
take those tools with me,
put in my tool shed and I go off down,

2250
01:40:24,431 --> 01:40:26,040
you know,
down the road or on a new journey.

2251
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:27,623
So that's what I do.
Well the proof is in the pudding if you 

2252
01:40:30,301 --> 01:40:33,690
really do in woodland firefighting 
because there's no glory in that.

2253
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:34,730
No Sir.
No.

2254
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:36,630
There's no fame.
There's no.

2255
01:40:36,650 --> 01:40:39,110
There's no one taking pictures of,
you know,

2256
01:40:39,111 --> 01:40:39,944
and that paycheck is small.
I'm a fucking make you want to eat 

2257
01:40:44,911 --> 01:40:46,920
today.
Wow.

2258
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:47,993
Yeah.
Is there's nothing involved in that 

2259
01:40:49,411 --> 01:40:50,244
minute.
They worked their ass off some but you 

2260
01:40:51,901 --> 01:40:53,610
just doing it as a challenge.
That's it.

2261
01:40:53,950 --> 01:40:55,270
Did they freak out when you're there?

2262
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:56,403
You know what I,
I think they're wondering why is a 43 

2263
01:40:58,901 --> 01:41:01,360
year old retired man,
you know,

2264
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:03,640
all this stuff you've done,
why are you out here?

2265
01:41:04,150 --> 01:41:05,620
And I explained it to them.
I'm out here.

2266
01:41:05,621 --> 01:41:06,281
I'm not here to,
you know,

2267
01:41:06,281 --> 01:41:08,200
to,
to learn from you all to grow.

2268
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,590
And also to never forget where I came 
from.

2269
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:14,830
You know,
that's where it starts.

2270
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:19,990
If that mentality of I'm going to pick 
up that fucking Pulaski and I'm going to

2271
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:22,350
dig this fucking fire alarm for three to
Emmaus,

2272
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,150
that's that mentality of never want to 
lose.

2273
01:41:25,151 --> 01:41:27,640
I never want to get so nice.
Where at,

2274
01:41:27,641 --> 01:41:29,200
Oh yeah,
I did it,

2275
01:41:29,201 --> 01:41:30,850
man.
I did it.

2276
01:41:31,570 --> 01:41:32,403
I did it.
I'm good at that mentality of I'm going 

2277
01:41:35,111 --> 01:41:38,650
to pick up that shovel and I'm willing 
to dig a three mile line is.

2278
01:41:38,690 --> 01:41:39,523
There's some about that mentality that 
I'm ready to go to work at any time and 

2279
01:41:42,731 --> 01:41:43,720
that's what keeps me.

2280
01:41:44,050 --> 01:41:45,410
Those are the sparks.
Like,

2281
01:41:45,411 --> 01:41:47,920
you know,
I'll look at motivation is just a spark.

2282
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:48,990
It's like,
it's like killing.

2283
01:41:49,490 --> 01:41:52,270
You know how a big fire starts.
It starts with a little smoke.

2284
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:55,490
It starts with a little cigarette being 
thrown in the woods nicely.

2285
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:56,443
All California's fucking burn up.
That's what I've been doing my whole 

2286
01:42:00,221 --> 01:42:04,210
life is I find these little sparks and 
once that little thing takes off,

2287
01:42:04,211 --> 01:42:05,830
that's a.
that's a one hour of fuel,

2288
01:42:06,090 --> 01:42:09,640
10 you got 10 our fuel,
then you can move that thing to what?

2289
01:42:10,030 --> 01:42:11,650
10,000?
Our fuel,

2290
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:13,113
these big logs and big trees that burned
for days and that's where you want to 

2291
01:42:15,851 --> 01:42:17,520
bring that motivation.
That's.

2292
01:42:17,530 --> 01:42:20,550
You want to bring that drive.
So if you have no kingdom,

2293
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:23,050
the killing is me going out with these 
young guys saying,

2294
01:42:23,330 --> 01:42:24,730
all right motherfucker,
you're 43.

2295
01:42:24,790 --> 01:42:26,560
It's a 20 year old.
Keep up with them.

2296
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:30,400
That kindling.
Now when I leave those young guys,

2297
01:42:30,730 --> 01:42:34,570
it has now become that 10 hour fuel and 
now that 10,000

2298
01:42:34,571 --> 01:42:36,880
hour fuels I used throughout my whole 
life.

2299
01:42:37,660 --> 01:42:39,070
I use that term or whole life man.
Hey,

2300
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:41,410
this summer at 43,
you went out there and you did that man.

2301
01:42:41,950 --> 01:42:44,230
So you know you're not giving up yet.
You're not done yet.

2302
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:46,510
Not Today,
not done today.

2303
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:47,433
That's a crazy choice to make.
The wildland firefighters a very 

2304
01:42:49,721 --> 01:42:51,100
interesting choice.
It is,

2305
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:54,040
it is a nasty job man.
Because again,

2306
01:42:54,041 --> 01:42:54,874
that's the proof of concept.
Like you're really just doing it just 

2307
01:42:59,801 --> 01:43:00,970
for the struggle.
That's it.

2308
01:43:01,310 --> 01:43:03,250
Is there other things you considered 
like that?

2309
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:05,770
Um,
so I will,

2310
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:09,970
I apply for smoke jumping this year,
so I'll be a smoke jumper this year,

2311
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:11,440
you know,
God willing.

2312
01:43:12,110 --> 01:43:14,720
I'm,
that's where it's at now.

2313
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:18,460
Now's my next military.
That's the next military.

2314
01:43:19,270 --> 01:43:22,960
And it's always about human growth.
It's not about money,

2315
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:25,330
not about money.
Human growth.

2316
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:26,620
That's the biggest.
Like I said,

2317
01:43:26,621 --> 01:43:29,140
my biggest trophy.
That's why I turned down $300,000.

2318
01:43:30,010 --> 01:43:31,660
The biggest trophy in life is what I've 
learned.

2319
01:43:31,661 --> 01:43:32,494
Like this brain,
if I could put this brand in somebodies 

2320
01:43:33,970 --> 01:43:34,721
head and said,
here you go,

2321
01:43:34,721 --> 01:43:37,090
merry Christmas.
They'd be a happy person.

2322
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:42,520
When I found out is that with no crowds,
no one cheering for,

2323
01:43:42,521 --> 01:43:43,990
you know,
racist,

2324
01:43:43,991 --> 01:43:46,720
no finish line.
It's an amazing,

2325
01:43:46,810 --> 01:43:50,710
amazing thing I've learned in my mind by
no one cheering you on.

2326
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:54,020
Like what that is is every morning I do 
what I do.

2327
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:57,630
I don't have a trainer waking me up 
there.

2328
01:43:57,680 --> 01:43:58,670
No one saying,
David,

2329
01:43:58,671 --> 01:44:02,270
you have to do this.
I don't have to do anything anymore.

2330
01:44:02,630 --> 01:44:05,540
I've done it.
That's the beauty of all of this.

2331
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:06,853
Knowing that everything I talk about,
no one even knows what the fuck I'm 

2332
01:44:09,411 --> 01:44:14,270
doing every day and I know that I am 
grinding like a motherfucker.

2333
01:44:14,630 --> 01:44:17,870
They see a woman that video of me 
running or some bullshit.

2334
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:19,730
Hopefully it motivates you.
Merry Christmas.

2335
01:44:20,450 --> 01:44:21,283
Dune.
I'm out there for fucking hours every 

2336
01:44:24,470 --> 01:44:29,470
fucking day and no one sees what the 
fuck I'm doing knowing this great,

2337
01:44:30,051 --> 01:44:31,010
beautiful thing,
man.

2338
01:44:31,670 --> 01:44:33,380
That is a beautiful thing about it,
right?

2339
01:44:33,381 --> 01:44:36,380
That you really are just doing it for 
the benefits of it.

2340
01:44:36,410 --> 01:44:38,270
That's it.
You have to do it that way.

2341
01:44:38,271 --> 01:44:39,104
It's not for show like there's a lot of 
people like you'll see the little video 

2342
01:44:42,861 --> 01:44:44,360
they do on instagram like,
bitch,

2343
01:44:44,361 --> 01:44:46,870
you are not doing that for very long on 
too fast.

2344
01:44:46,890 --> 01:44:48,460
I said,
this is not real.

2345
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:53,480
I got my one minute on tape now.
Yeah,

2346
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:57,740
exactly.
If it's so much for show,

2347
01:44:58,120 --> 01:44:58,953
I do enjoy those videos that you're 
doing on instagram though is a little 

2348
01:45:02,161 --> 01:45:04,850
motivational things.
I've put some of them up on my page.

2349
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,780
I appreciate you posted it.
There's a.

2350
01:45:06,930 --> 01:45:08,600
those are,
those are great man.

2351
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:10,520
Like what are you.
Are you just like,

2352
01:45:10,670 --> 01:45:11,503
do you just get a thought in your head 
while you're out there running and you 

2353
01:45:13,491 --> 01:45:15,200
just want to get it down?
Yeah,

2354
01:45:15,201 --> 01:45:18,770
so what I'll do is I,
my fiance does all these videos man,

2355
01:45:18,771 --> 01:45:20,420
so God bless you.
It sometimes be 3:00

2356
01:45:20,421 --> 01:45:23,750
in the fucking morning and I'll be 
working out and I said,

2357
01:45:23,751 --> 01:45:24,620
hey,
wake the fuck up.

2358
01:45:24,621 --> 01:45:27,650
I got some shit.
Like hey man,

2359
01:45:27,651 --> 01:45:29,750
it came to me man.
I got some shit for these people man.

2360
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:32,120
So that's what happens.
Like usually when I'm working out,

2361
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:36,110
I get this great inspiration.
I some people,

2362
01:45:36,111 --> 01:45:36,944
I think it's bullshit but my,
my mind works best under extreme pain 

2363
01:45:41,181 --> 01:45:42,014
and suffering.
Like when I'm like God wouldn't be out 

2364
01:45:42,831 --> 01:45:43,664
here and that's when I'm going deep into
the cellar of my mind and that's when 

2365
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:48,740
all that gargoyle shit starts to come 
up.

2366
01:45:48,740 --> 01:45:49,573
Man,
you know what I'm saying?

2367
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:53,480
And so she gets called out all the time 
like,

2368
01:45:53,481 --> 01:45:56,420
Hey,
I'll run home and say,

2369
01:45:56,421 --> 01:45:57,350
Hey,
get the car,

2370
01:45:57,680 --> 01:46:02,060
meet me at 17th street because by that 
time I have all my shit together.

2371
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:03,320
So I saw this happens,
man.

2372
01:46:03,321 --> 01:46:04,154
It's not like a rehearsed thing.
That's why sometimes I'm a post on 

2373
01:46:06,321 --> 01:46:07,640
Monday.
Usually it's like every Monday,

2374
01:46:07,641 --> 01:46:09,980
but sometimes it's two,
sometimes it's Thursday,

2375
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:12,260
you know,
and that's what I do.

2376
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:17,700
I'm trying to now give back to people in
a way that's real and authentic and just

2377
01:46:17,751 --> 01:46:19,940
being me.
What has the response been like,

2378
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:22,340
like after you did the podcast the first
time,

2379
01:46:22,341 --> 01:46:25,550
what was the response like and what was 
the response like on social media?

2380
01:46:25,570 --> 01:46:26,301
Well,
it was crazy.

2381
01:46:26,301 --> 01:46:29,150
Man is that you are my usher and I'm 
fucking Bieber.

2382
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:31,100
That's the fucking response,
man.

2383
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:33,380
So you're crowd.
Um,

2384
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:36,800
for some reason they,
they resonate with me.

2385
01:46:36,950 --> 01:46:38,240
They,
they understand,

2386
01:46:38,241 --> 01:46:38,950
they,
they,

2387
01:46:38,950 --> 01:46:41,080
they,
they get me and they,

2388
01:46:41,140 --> 01:46:43,890
they love the message.
And like,

2389
01:46:43,910 --> 01:46:45,860
so if you put some bullshit up on my 
site,

2390
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:48,740
I block and delete your ass.
This ain't,

2391
01:46:48,770 --> 01:46:50,130
this ain't a playground like,
like,

2392
01:46:50,150 --> 01:46:50,983
like my site.
I'm not fucking around with you 

2393
01:46:52,621 --> 01:46:53,454
motherfuckers.
I want to give you some tools that I 

2394
01:46:55,531 --> 01:46:56,460
learned.
If you want to take them,

2395
01:46:56,461 --> 01:46:58,470
take not merry Christmas.
I go on my merry way.

2396
01:46:58,710 --> 01:47:00,480
I don't care.
So if you go on there,

2397
01:47:00,481 --> 01:47:02,330
you want to play around and you want to,
you know,

2398
01:47:02,870 --> 01:47:05,410
they called those people going to troll.
Fuck,

2399
01:47:05,450 --> 01:47:08,190
he ain't showing my shit.
I'm going to block your monkey ass off.

2400
01:47:08,191 --> 01:47:09,024
My Shit.
Quit.

2401
01:47:09,910 --> 01:47:12,150
I went.
So I've just their friends.

2402
01:47:12,151 --> 01:47:12,841
Jamie.
Yeah.

2403
01:47:12,841 --> 01:47:15,900
Tell him.
So I've developed like a small community

2404
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:17,093
of people who can go in there and it's 
not just me talking so people have now 

2405
01:47:19,891 --> 01:47:20,724
joined in and there.
I've seen people whose a 150 pounds on 

2406
01:47:23,941 --> 01:47:24,571
my site,
man.

2407
01:47:24,571 --> 01:47:25,404
I'm like in the end they're writing 
about and they're starting to break 

2408
01:47:27,271 --> 01:47:30,540
themselves down.
Like I broke myself down like,

2409
01:47:30,541 --> 01:47:31,830
hey,
I went through this.

2410
01:47:31,830 --> 01:47:32,663
I went through this divorce and this 
happened in it and I tried to kill 

2411
01:47:34,411 --> 01:47:35,244
myself.
It gets raw and then people are now 

2412
01:47:38,250 --> 01:47:40,680
going on and commenting on their shit.
Saying hey,

2413
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:42,300
keep it up,
do what you're doing.

2414
01:47:42,301 --> 01:47:44,190
It's become like a big fucking like,
hey,

2415
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:45,713
it's a community of people trying to 
fucking get better and that's what it's 

2416
01:47:48,781 --> 01:47:49,321
about.
Man.

2417
01:47:49,321 --> 01:47:51,810
This ain't about to David Goggins 
fucking show.

2418
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:54,180
No Man.
I'm Mr Kenley.

2419
01:47:54,990 --> 01:47:57,390
You motherfuckers take this shit and let
shit burn.

2420
01:47:57,970 --> 01:48:00,420
Also.
You probably need all these other people

2421
01:48:00,421 --> 01:48:02,900
out there grinding to for fuel.
Oh Man.

2422
01:48:02,910 --> 01:48:05,310
Oh No.
That's the thing now like people go,

2423
01:48:05,311 --> 01:48:06,144
what motivates you now?
What motivates me now is that there's 

2424
01:48:08,551 --> 01:48:09,384
over 600 some odd thousand people 
looking at me saying motherfucking 

2425
01:48:14,161 --> 01:48:14,994
goggins is somewhere out there.
He saw her out there fucking getting 

2426
01:48:17,311 --> 01:48:20,970
after it and I am so you ain't never 
fucking loan.

2427
01:48:21,450 --> 01:48:24,540
I'm out there somewhere.
Six hundred some thousand people.

2428
01:48:24,541 --> 01:48:26,120
There's a chance that when you're 
working out,

2429
01:48:26,121 --> 01:48:29,100
I don't care if you're fucking 
Washington DC and I'm in Nashville.

2430
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:33,420
There's a good chance the same time 
we're getting after it and I want people

2431
01:48:33,421 --> 01:48:36,630
to know that and it's the real deal we 
are getting after together.

2432
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:40,440
Not Know like happy family shit,
but we're getting after it.

2433
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:41,900
No.

2434
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:42,381
Yeah.
Well,

2435
01:48:42,381 --> 01:48:44,510
that is,
that's giant for people,

2436
01:48:44,511 --> 01:48:45,344
man,
that the sense of community and to know 

2437
01:48:46,551 --> 01:48:47,384
that there's likeminded folks out there,
they're also trying to improve the 

2438
01:48:49,641 --> 01:48:53,000
journey to overcome their own demons,
get past their own bullshit,

2439
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:56,000
wash their own weaknesses,
cows up their own mind.

2440
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:59,260
I love that.
It's not time for some soft shit.

2441
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:00,960
It's not top of soft shit,
man.

2442
01:49:00,961 --> 01:49:04,390
I know this isn't a fucking playground.
Don't come on my instagram,

2443
01:49:04,391 --> 01:49:06,580
facebook or twitter talking to some 
bullshit.

2444
01:49:07,390 --> 01:49:08,223
Come on if you want to,
if you want to join the community and 

2445
01:49:09,851 --> 01:49:13,690
get hard and see what you're about.
Don't talk about rest.

2446
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:15,670
You know,
how do you do it now?

2447
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:18,550
That's fucking.
Stop thinking so much and that's put the

2448
01:49:18,551 --> 01:49:20,770
shoes on and get grind and you do

2449
01:49:21,210 --> 01:49:23,070
without those comments to say,
you know,

2450
01:49:23,110 --> 01:49:23,943
this is terrible advice.
Restroom recovery is the most important 

2451
01:49:26,271 --> 01:49:31,271
thing.
God block all my shit,

2452
01:49:32,681 --> 01:49:34,530
son.
You're not gonna last,

2453
01:49:34,580 --> 01:49:37,190
not my site here.
That shit.

2454
01:49:37,220 --> 01:49:38,990
There's a lot of people looking for 
built in.

2455
01:49:38,991 --> 01:49:42,200
Excuse her man per.
They're looking for it,

2456
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:43,273
but then there's a lot of people also 
that are just really interested in 

2457
01:49:46,870 --> 01:49:49,870
personal growth.
They're interested in really finding out

2458
01:49:49,871 --> 01:49:54,100
what they're made of the re interested 
in improving their ability to toughen up

2459
01:49:54,101 --> 01:49:56,080
and to discipline themselves and they're
looking.

2460
01:49:56,260 --> 01:49:58,210
They're looking for people like you and 
other people.

2461
01:49:58,211 --> 01:50:01,210
Just add to that momentum.
Once you get going,

2462
01:50:01,211 --> 01:50:02,890
it's easier to keep going.
That's it,

2463
01:50:02,891 --> 01:50:04,000
man.
Once you get going,

2464
01:50:04,001 --> 01:50:04,570
it's easier to do.

2465
01:50:04,570 --> 01:50:06,050
Keep showing up.
It is.

2466
01:50:06,140 --> 01:50:06,973
It is.
You have to get past that hurdle and 

2467
01:50:08,541 --> 01:50:10,040
once you get past that man,
you're flying

2468
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:12,480
and then you see other people that are 
doing it too and you realize like,

2469
01:50:12,481 --> 01:50:14,130
this is a.
This is a movement.

2470
01:50:14,131 --> 01:50:16,530
There's a lot of other people out there 
that it is a movement.

2471
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:18,060
It is a movement.
Well,

2472
01:50:18,061 --> 01:50:19,680
that's the thing that resonates with 
you.

2473
01:50:19,681 --> 01:50:23,100
I think about the audience of this 
podcast that I've had quite a few people

2474
01:50:23,101 --> 01:50:23,934
on that have that same message and it 
resonates with people because we're all 

2475
01:50:26,731 --> 01:50:29,130
trying to improve ourselves.
No one's perfect.

2476
01:50:29,180 --> 01:50:30,940
I hope this is not.
I'm not perfect now.

2477
01:50:30,941 --> 01:50:34,080
I never will be.
You're not and you never will be,

2478
01:50:34,081 --> 01:50:34,914
but you're better than you were 
yesterday and you're going to be better 

2479
01:50:36,601 --> 01:50:38,250
tomorrow.
That's the truth day right there,

2480
01:50:38,251 --> 01:50:39,330
man.
That's what that book says.

2481
01:50:39,331 --> 01:50:41,520
I am not fucking perfect,
man.

2482
01:50:41,850 --> 01:50:42,683
I had the Boston.
Now finally tell you all I am very 

2483
01:50:45,001 --> 01:50:45,834
flawed,
but in that saying that you're very 

2484
01:50:47,371 --> 01:50:48,990
flawed and saying that you're very 
perfect.

2485
01:50:48,991 --> 01:50:49,824
You exhibit way more strength than 
someone who bullshits and pretends 

2486
01:50:52,590 --> 01:50:57,590
someone who puts up some fake ass 
fucking fake facade of perfection,

2487
01:50:58,520 --> 01:50:59,353
of moral integrity and growth and 
honesty and those people are a real 

2488
01:51:02,761 --> 01:51:03,594
problem.

2489
01:51:03,830 --> 01:51:05,330
It's exhausting.
It's exhausting.

2490
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:07,430
Fuck you did it for awhile.
I'm like,

2491
01:51:08,290 --> 01:51:10,730
I'm fucked up.
I give up.

2492
01:51:11,150 --> 01:51:12,320
I quit.
I quit,

2493
01:51:12,380 --> 01:51:13,640
I quit.
I'm fucked up.

2494
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:15,740
I'm going to tell you all.
I can't do this anymore.

2495
01:51:15,741 --> 01:51:17,330
This is who I am.
But the confidence

2496
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:18,193
to view of constantly grinding and 
constantly putting in that work is what 

2497
01:51:20,731 --> 01:51:22,770
leads you to be able to express 
yourself.

2498
01:51:22,771 --> 01:51:24,360
So honestly,
you're right.

2499
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:24,940
I,
I,

2500
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:25,980
I,
for the first time,

2501
01:51:25,981 --> 01:51:29,070
believe in David Goggins and I don't 
care who else believes in me.

2502
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:33,000
I don't care for the first time I left 
and I can tell you all my fucked up shit

2503
01:51:33,630 --> 01:51:35,830
and without lying.
That's powerful.

2504
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:38,280
No longer care.
That's powerful.

2505
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:40,050
That.
See everybody could get to that.

2506
01:51:40,260 --> 01:51:41,093
Then you do.
You don't have any excuses because you 

2507
01:51:42,151 --> 01:51:43,350
don't need any.
That's right.

2508
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:46,130
None.
You're like me.

2509
01:51:46,310 --> 01:51:50,450
Merry Christmas.
Kwanzaa.

2510
01:51:50,510 --> 01:51:51,420
Keep moving.
Yes,

2511
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:52,830
it go.
Yeah.

2512
01:51:53,210 --> 01:51:55,490
Good luck to you.
Exactly.

2513
01:51:55,491 --> 01:51:56,870
Yeah.
We're all in this thing together.

2514
01:51:57,380 --> 01:51:59,000
Yeah.
You got your own path.

2515
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:02,240
And so one of us to stare at those shoes
for 30 minutes every day.

2516
01:52:04,550 --> 01:52:05,690
That's so true,
man.

2517
01:52:05,990 --> 01:52:06,823
So true.
So fire jumping and woodland 

2518
01:52:09,651 --> 01:52:11,360
firefighting.
That didn't expect that.

2519
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:14,000
I didn't hear that coming.
That's interesting man.

2520
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:14,990
Yup.
And W,

2521
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:15,833
what?
Did you have any other options that you 

2522
01:52:16,671 --> 01:52:18,500
were looking at before you dived into 
those?

2523
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:19,453
You know,
what those are the first two that came 

2524
01:52:20,031 --> 01:52:22,360
up because I saw how hard it was,
you know,

2525
01:52:22,820 --> 01:52:25,670
at 43 and these jobs,
like in the military,

2526
01:52:25,671 --> 01:52:29,570
you're a dinosaur trying to retire and 
wild land firefighting,

2527
01:52:29,571 --> 01:52:30,404
you know,
you start to move into these desk jobs 

2528
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:33,380
and that was the challenge of it.
You know,

2529
01:52:33,381 --> 01:52:35,600
I'm like a,
I'm like a fucking rookie at 43,

2530
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:38,330
so I'm like being talked to like a 
little bitch,

2531
01:52:38,570 --> 01:52:40,320
so it takes a lot for me,
you know,

2532
01:52:40,340 --> 01:52:41,173
I'm like,
man,

2533
01:52:41,390 --> 01:52:42,920
I've done some things man.

2534
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:46,220
Hang on now.
But I have to know humble myself again.

2535
01:52:47,390 --> 01:52:48,223
It's hard to humble yourself.
He got some 21 year old little punk ass 

2536
01:52:50,181 --> 01:52:51,014
bitch say,
Hey,

2537
01:52:51,670 --> 01:52:52,970
pick up that shit and come on.
I'm like,

2538
01:52:53,580 --> 01:52:55,060
what the fuck to say?
I'm like,

2539
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:55,641
you know,
but I'm like,

2540
01:52:55,641 --> 01:52:57,060
okay God,
it's like your rookie man.

2541
01:52:57,061 --> 01:52:57,894
Like,
so that's all the training behind the 

2542
01:52:58,881 --> 01:52:59,714
mindset of it all is that you can't ever
be the point you never learned from 

2543
01:53:04,071 --> 01:53:04,990
people.
Right.

2544
01:53:05,150 --> 01:53:05,983
You know,
you have to always humble yourself and 

2545
01:53:07,011 --> 01:53:08,240
go back to that.
Yeah.

2546
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:09,083
You know,
like right now there's people listening 

2547
01:53:09,801 --> 01:53:10,820
to podcasts like,
Oh yeah,

2548
01:53:10,821 --> 01:53:11,960
you're great galleries.
Nah,

2549
01:53:12,110 --> 01:53:12,943
you ain't Shit Goggins.
And that's the mindset I always want to 

2550
01:53:15,291 --> 01:53:15,621
have.
No,

2551
01:53:15,621 --> 01:53:19,070
like I'm not proud of myself,
but you have to always keep that.

2552
01:53:19,071 --> 01:53:23,990
Like I want to keep that dog in me and I
can't always know everything.

2553
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:25,970
Yeah,
we'll be in the beginner at something.

2554
01:53:25,971 --> 01:53:26,804
That's fantastic.
It's amazing being learning new things 

2555
01:53:29,001 --> 01:53:31,520
is fantastic for everything else.
So much growth in that.

2556
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,130
Have you?
Do you fuck around with martial arts?

2557
01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:36,770
You know what?
I learned a little bit.

2558
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:39,980
I've never gotten crazy in it.
I've never gotten crazy.

2559
01:53:39,981 --> 01:53:41,780
I boxed a little bit.
Where do you live?

2560
01:53:41,990 --> 01:53:44,250
I live in Nashville,
so out of Jujitsu.

2561
01:53:44,290 --> 01:53:45,980
Nashville.
You should get involved in Jujitsu.

2562
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:48,020
You would take to it like a duck to 
water.

2563
01:53:48,021 --> 01:53:49,850
I'll find your spot,
man.

2564
01:53:50,050 --> 01:53:51,410
I'm finding your spot.
You.

2565
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:53,510
You get obsessed with that shit.
Oh God.

2566
01:53:53,550 --> 01:53:54,383
Because that's a never ending pile of 
fucking tangled bodies and gamble 

2567
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:01,813
because it's something that you just get
better at all the time and there's no 

2568
01:54:04,401 --> 01:54:05,360
hiding.
Right?

2569
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:08,830
Either you get choked or you don't.
Either you survive or you don't know.

2570
01:54:08,860 --> 01:54:11,180
I've been in a lot of ground in a lot of
ground gangs,

2571
01:54:11,181 --> 01:54:12,014
man,
but I've never really learned the skill 

2572
01:54:12,941 --> 01:54:13,550
sets.

2573
01:54:13,550 --> 01:54:15,260
Yeah,
so it'd be nice to do that.

2574
01:54:15,430 --> 01:54:16,880
I'll hook it up.
Please do.

2575
01:54:16,881 --> 01:54:18,830
I think you would get obsessed with it 
the same way.

2576
01:54:18,831 --> 01:54:21,830
Jockos obsessed with it.
Same with a lot of other seals,

2577
01:54:21,831 --> 01:54:25,640
get obsessed with martial arts or it 
would be nice to do it because it's also

2578
01:54:25,730 --> 01:54:27,800
constant competition as well.
I mean,

2579
01:54:27,801 --> 01:54:30,980
you can get into competition every 
single night of the week real and.

2580
01:54:30,981 --> 01:54:32,000
Yeah,
absolutely.

2581
01:54:32,180 --> 01:54:35,420
And as a guy who's just starting out,
you're going to be a white belt,

2582
01:54:35,421 --> 01:54:40,370
you're going to get strangled a lot.
You want to start from the beginning.

2583
01:54:40,610 --> 01:54:41,770
You're going to start from the 
beginning.

2584
01:54:41,780 --> 01:54:44,210
One hundred percent,
plenty guys your size.

2585
01:54:44,211 --> 01:54:47,450
There's plenty of guys that have been 
doing it for fucking decades,

2586
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:49,790
like the hands on me and stuff.
Good.

2587
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:51,660
Yeah,
Goggins you coming home,

2588
01:54:53,270 --> 01:54:56,600
but it's also a good thing to have the 
kind of cardio and endurance you have to

2589
01:54:57,710 --> 01:54:58,370
get people.

2590
01:54:58,370 --> 01:54:59,220
So I've,
I've,

2591
01:54:59,260 --> 01:55:01,670
I've rolled with a lot of guys who have 
skills,

2592
01:55:02,330 --> 01:55:05,120
but the thing that I really have,
and I'm not gonna Brag on it,

2593
01:55:05,121 --> 01:55:07,550
man.
I got fucked up cardio base,

2594
01:55:07,551 --> 01:55:08,384
man.
I got fucked up cardio basement and my 

2595
01:55:11,271 --> 01:55:15,560
mentality is kind of fucked up too.
So I realized that we're fighting.

2596
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:16,813
If you get a big cardio base and your 
mindset is fucked up to cardio's almost 

2597
01:55:21,321 --> 01:55:22,950
everything,
that's what skills,

2598
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:26,870
skills are everything because a lot of 
guys with skills also have some cardio.

2599
01:55:26,871 --> 01:55:27,704
They have enough to fuck you up,
but to have tremendous cardio with big 

2600
01:55:31,611 --> 01:55:34,880
skills is everything.
I see him a man dying.

2601
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:35,863
Yeah,
because so many guys started 100 

2602
01:55:36,891 --> 01:55:39,050
percent,
but three minutes into the fight they're

2603
01:55:39,051 --> 01:55:39,980
at 80,
right?

2604
01:55:40,010 --> 01:55:42,350
You know,
five minutes into the fight there at 60.

2605
01:55:42,410 --> 01:55:43,980
That's right.
Then they for a minute

2606
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:46,020
they come back.
But if you're,

2607
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:47,033
if you're in like a rolling session,
like when you roll your role for nine 

2608
01:55:49,771 --> 01:55:54,000
minutes straight.
So you and this guy and most of the time

2609
01:55:54,001 --> 01:55:56,790
there's multiple taps.
You'll tap him and he'll tap.

2610
01:55:56,840 --> 01:55:59,490
You tap each other.
But nine minutes man,

2611
01:55:59,491 --> 01:56:02,340
it is exhausting when that bell goes 
off,

2612
01:56:02,341 --> 01:56:03,174
the last you know the bell for 30 
seconds and you got 30 seconds left in 

2613
01:56:07,231 --> 01:56:11,310
nine minutes and then banging it's over.
It's done.

2614
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:12,173
And then do you take a minute off and 
you find a new partner that's good shit 

2615
01:56:14,641 --> 01:56:16,230
back in there.
You'd love it.

2616
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:18,840
It sounds like a good grind grind right 
there.

2617
01:56:18,841 --> 01:56:19,700
You love it.
Yeah.

2618
01:56:19,740 --> 01:56:21,310
Getting your black belt.
Hey,

2619
01:56:21,590 --> 01:56:24,030
some of that take about.
If I went like this hard at it.

2620
01:56:25,590 --> 01:56:26,423
It's hard to say because it depends 
entirely upon how much emphasis you put 

2621
01:56:30,571 --> 01:56:33,090
on learning new techniques and broiling 
and drilling.

2622
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:35,850
Drilling is gigantic and that's the 
thing that people don't like to do.

2623
01:56:36,230 --> 01:56:37,620
Cause Jujitsu,
so fun.

2624
01:56:37,830 --> 01:56:41,550
People like to just roll because it's 
this sparring is where it's at.

2625
01:56:41,551 --> 01:56:41,971
Like,
ah,

2626
01:56:41,971 --> 01:56:44,550
I don't want to do those practice.
I want to choke people.

2627
01:56:44,630 --> 01:56:46,440
Like I knew a few things.
Let's do that.

2628
01:56:46,441 --> 01:56:47,370
Okay,
and I do this.

2629
01:56:47,830 --> 01:56:48,663
Okay,
let me get in there and you want a lot 

2630
01:56:51,181 --> 01:56:52,014
of Jujitsu schools.
They'll start out with like one or two 

2631
01:56:54,391 --> 01:56:57,300
techniques and then you roll most of the
classes just sparring,

2632
01:56:57,810 --> 01:57:01,890
but the right way to do it really is to 
drill way more than you spar.

2633
01:57:02,160 --> 01:57:05,110
She'd be drilling all the time and live 
drilling too,

2634
01:57:05,250 --> 01:57:08,430
like you start out where God has your 
back ready go,

2635
01:57:08,580 --> 01:57:09,413
and then from there you got to try to 
escape and do it the right thing to try 

2636
01:57:12,211 --> 01:57:13,044
to use the right technique to get out of
that position or you'll start out with 

2637
01:57:17,401 --> 01:57:18,234
an arm bar,
but he's defending and you've got to 

2638
01:57:19,411 --> 01:57:23,040
figure out how to extend it in those 
live drills,

2639
01:57:23,220 --> 01:57:24,990
straight drills like technique,
drills,

2640
01:57:24,991 --> 01:57:25,824
and then live drills are,
I think even more important in the 

2641
01:57:29,910 --> 01:57:30,410
beginning to,
uh,

2642
01:57:30,410 --> 01:57:31,243
to,
to your personal development and growth 

2643
01:57:32,251 --> 01:57:34,620
as a Jujitsu player than even sparring.

2644
01:57:35,100 --> 01:57:39,480
But a guy like you who's smart and tough
and will go crazy shit.

2645
01:57:40,140 --> 01:57:42,450
It shouldn't take that long.
It takes people.

2646
01:57:42,451 --> 01:57:43,284
I mean,
it depends on how much you dedicate 

2647
01:57:43,771 --> 01:57:44,604
yourself to.
Bj Penn got his black belt in three 

2648
01:57:46,321 --> 01:57:47,154
years.
What?

2649
01:57:47,250 --> 01:57:48,090
Yeah,
but it's crazy.

2650
01:57:48,091 --> 01:57:48,940
He's Bj Penn.
He,

2651
01:57:48,950 --> 01:57:53,140
so like the prodigy for a reason,
right?

2652
01:57:53,370 --> 01:57:54,203
I had a conversation with them about 
though it was really interesting once 

2653
01:57:56,430 --> 01:57:57,150
he,
uh,

2654
01:57:57,150 --> 01:57:57,983
he goes,
uh,

2655
01:57:58,290 --> 01:58:00,660
he was talking to some other dude and 
the guy said,

2656
01:58:00,661 --> 01:58:03,300
uh,
I got my black belt at three years,

2657
01:58:03,301 --> 01:58:04,830
just like you did bj.
And He was like,

2658
01:58:04,831 --> 01:58:05,431
wow,
man.

2659
01:58:05,431 --> 01:58:06,211
He goes,
you must be good.

2660
01:58:06,211 --> 01:58:06,631
He goes,
no,

2661
01:58:06,631 --> 01:58:07,470
man.
He goes,

2662
01:58:07,471 --> 01:58:09,630
I'm a dick.
Did just like you.

2663
01:58:09,930 --> 01:58:11,070
He goes,
you addicted,

2664
01:58:11,071 --> 01:58:12,510
you're addicted.
And he's like,

2665
01:58:12,540 --> 01:58:14,100
I never thought about it.
That way goes,

2666
01:58:14,101 --> 01:58:16,870
yeah.
I'm addicted to jujitsu to get addicted.

2667
01:58:16,890 --> 01:58:17,723
Like it takes over your mind.
Everything your days are spent thinking 

2668
01:58:20,911 --> 01:58:21,744
about.
Some guy would triangled you this 

2669
01:58:22,471 --> 01:58:24,720
motherfucker.
How do you get me shit?

2670
01:58:25,050 --> 01:58:25,883
Like I get that till I got choked out 10
years ago that I think about sometimes 

2671
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:32,220
when I'm lifting I'll be tired and I'll 
think about a guy caught me 10 years.

2672
01:58:32,221 --> 01:58:33,800
I want to like fuck.
Oh,

2673
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:37,000
just about life man.
Yeah.

2674
01:58:37,001 --> 01:58:39,150
Because I think about not being choked 
out,

2675
01:58:39,151 --> 01:58:41,040
but I think about a lot of shit like 
that.

2676
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:42,360
Yeah.
Little failures

2677
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:44,880
and just keep pushing.
They grind on me like that

2678
01:58:44,940 --> 01:58:45,773
motherfucker man.
And that's what you're talking about 

2679
01:58:46,971 --> 01:58:47,804
earlier too.
It's like the the mind has these 

2680
01:58:49,551 --> 01:58:51,980
reserves.
You can trick it and pull them out.

2681
01:58:52,110 --> 01:58:55,250
Yes.
Inspirational reserves like you did when

2682
01:58:55,251 --> 01:58:56,870
you.
When you guys were going through buds,

2683
01:58:57,230 --> 01:58:58,063
we just found that trigger and then all 
of sudden you throw in that boat in the 

2684
01:59:00,471 --> 01:59:01,304
air.
The mind always has the tactical 

2685
01:59:03,171 --> 01:59:06,580
advantage over you.
Why is it it knows your fear

2686
01:59:07,010 --> 01:59:10,320
and nausea securities.
It knows where their height can't hide.

2687
01:59:10,350 --> 01:59:12,090
You can't hide that motherfucker,
man.

2688
01:59:13,060 --> 01:59:15,360
I forget the tactical banners on your 
son.

2689
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:16,890
That's gonna.
Get you man.

2690
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:18,773
It's a beast.

2691
01:59:19,330 --> 01:59:20,650
Be your best lesson,
right?

2692
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:23,380
That your mInd.
Your mind knows everything.

2693
01:59:23,381 --> 01:59:25,250
You cannot hide from it.
So don't ever try.

2694
01:59:25,300 --> 01:59:28,310
Don't try and beat that motherfucker up 
gotta.

2695
01:59:28,330 --> 01:59:30,340
Keep going at it.
That's also what you did in this book.

2696
01:59:30,341 --> 01:59:31,174
You didn't try to like paint yourself in
a glamorous or flattering way at any 

2697
01:59:35,771 --> 01:59:36,604
point in time.
You were honest at every step of the 

2698
01:59:38,501 --> 01:59:39,334
way,
which I think is just gigantic for 

2699
01:59:40,781 --> 01:59:45,280
people too because you can tell when 
someone's stroking themselves,

2700
01:59:45,490 --> 01:59:48,550
bullshitting themselves is the message 
just won't come through.

2701
01:59:48,910 --> 01:59:51,490
but this,
your you come through in this book,

2702
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:52,593
you know,
you who you are and what you became and 

2703
01:59:54,221 --> 01:59:58,270
how you became who you are and who you 
used to be and why you were with the way

2704
01:59:58,271 --> 01:59:59,830
you used to be.
All that comes through.

2705
01:59:59,831 --> 02:00:02,380
it's like there's no filter.
This is just your,

2706
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:03,333
your thoughts like you,
what you remember about your life and 

2707
02:00:06,851 --> 02:00:07,684
what you think about right now.
Just all comes out onto the pages 

2708
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:10,881
harder.
They,

2709
02:00:10,881 --> 02:00:13,390
I've done my entire life.
I would imagine.

2710
02:00:13,391 --> 02:00:14,710
I have fucking,
I don't know.

2711
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:18,100
People are buying this book.
Then I walk up to people.

2712
02:00:18,101 --> 02:00:19,390
People walk up to me.
I'm like,

2713
02:00:19,391 --> 02:00:20,770
what are you thinking about mother 
fucker?

2714
02:00:22,060 --> 02:00:27,060
I think he probably painted in the bed.
Were you thinking about.

2715
02:00:28,570 --> 02:00:30,810
Oh,
that's hilarious.

2716
02:00:30,990 --> 02:00:31,801
I know,
right?

2717
02:00:31,801 --> 02:00:34,570
Like you like thinking about opening it 
up all you know,

2718
02:00:34,610 --> 02:00:35,780
all bobby.
Hey,

2719
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:38,680
how about you motherfuckers?
Tell me something about you.

2720
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:41,910
That's what people love,
right?

2721
02:00:41,911 --> 02:00:44,440
When they know some shit about.
I don't know nothing about them,

2722
02:00:44,670 --> 02:00:46,230
but nobody.
That's anonymous.

2723
02:00:46,231 --> 02:00:47,370
Trolls,
man.

2724
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:49,370
Get at me.
Oh,

2725
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:50,273
there's a lot of those,
but they're all doing that to 

2726
02:00:52,291 --> 02:00:53,880
themselves.
They don't even understand.

2727
02:00:53,881 --> 02:00:55,860
When you do that,
you're doing it to yourself.

2728
02:00:56,180 --> 02:00:58,380
If you are attacking someone 
[inaudible],

2729
02:00:58,381 --> 02:00:59,214
you know that they have a weakness,
but you're pretending you don't have 

2730
02:01:01,081 --> 02:01:03,510
one.
You are attacking yourself.

2731
02:01:03,550 --> 02:01:06,790
You are chipping away at your own 
personal sovereignty,

2732
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:10,290
chipping away your own respect.
So true man.

2733
02:01:10,330 --> 02:01:12,420
You can't respect yourself.
You know you're a pussy.

2734
02:01:12,421 --> 02:01:13,980
You're ship though,
joe.

2735
02:01:13,981 --> 02:01:14,814
To me,
I start looking at people realizing I 

2736
02:01:17,191 --> 02:01:22,191
know something about you because they 
don't want to talk about it.

2737
02:01:22,640 --> 02:01:23,730
right?
I already know it.

2738
02:01:23,790 --> 02:01:25,740
Yeah,
if you're talking shit about me.

2739
02:01:25,950 --> 02:01:27,810
Yeah,
I know you're fucked up.

2740
02:01:28,220 --> 02:01:29,910
Yeah.
That's what all these cats that come out

2741
02:01:29,911 --> 02:01:31,200
right now who don't like me,
whatever.

2742
02:01:31,201 --> 02:01:32,160
I'm like,
really?

2743
02:01:32,161 --> 02:01:34,140
Man,
that shit happened 30 fucking years ago.

2744
02:01:34,141 --> 02:01:35,340
Fifteen years ago.
You're still.

2745
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:38,280
you're still fucked up about that.
Oh man.

2746
02:01:38,580 --> 02:01:41,000
I know something about you brother.
Zach it over everything.

2747
02:01:41,450 --> 02:01:44,870
I'm good.
It's water under the bridge grind.

2748
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:47,170
The grind does.
That's it.

2749
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:49,170
You're not grinding hard.
If,

2750
02:01:49,210 --> 02:01:52,550
if you're worried about something that 
someone did to you years ago,

2751
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:54,223
you're beIng a pussy to yourself may not
getting out there and squeezing that 

2752
02:01:56,871 --> 02:01:59,650
fucking sold out every day.
If you grind harm,

2753
02:01:59,660 --> 02:02:02,780
I've got time to worry about your monkey
ass I to them about you,

2754
02:02:02,781 --> 02:02:05,810
man,
because tomorrow I got to go back to the

2755
02:02:05,811 --> 02:02:06,644
grind and tomorrow I go back to the 
grind again and again and again and 

2756
02:02:10,221 --> 02:02:11,054
again.
I don't have time to put you into the 

2757
02:02:12,741 --> 02:02:14,360
hate bank.
There's no hate,

2758
02:02:14,410 --> 02:02:15,510
so I'll filter it out,
man,

2759
02:02:15,530 --> 02:02:17,240
through the grind.
People don't get it.

2760
02:02:17,241 --> 02:02:20,000
There's there's great joy in the grind,
great Jordan,

2761
02:02:20,001 --> 02:02:22,640
the suffer.
It's totally cleanses your body out,

2762
02:02:22,641 --> 02:02:24,590
man.
If any kind of hate makes you grow up,

2763
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:27,350
it's also the being honest about it.

2764
02:02:27,390 --> 02:02:30,030
Every step of the way,
the way you are in this book and the way

2765
02:02:30,031 --> 02:02:30,864
you are where you talk about things,
not not trying to paint yourself in a 

2766
02:02:33,961 --> 02:02:35,400
flattering way,
no it.

2767
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:40,480
It forces you to continue to perform 
right by exposing all the shit that used

2768
02:02:41,011 --> 02:02:43,260
to do.
By exposing your procrastination,

2769
02:02:43,261 --> 02:02:45,570
you've slips your,
you're falling,

2770
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:48,330
you're falling back down and getting fat
again.

2771
02:02:48,510 --> 02:02:49,343
All that stuff.
It forces you to be consistent like you 

2772
02:02:53,161 --> 02:02:55,170
know you did it today.
You know you did it today.

2773
02:02:55,171 --> 02:02:56,730
Do you know you're going to be able to 
do it tomorrow?

2774
02:02:56,880 --> 02:02:57,590
Well,
you have to.

2775
02:02:57,590 --> 02:02:58,423
You have to know.

2776
02:02:58,530 --> 02:03:00,600
That's good to know.
That's my biggest fear of man,

2777
02:03:00,630 --> 02:03:04,680
is that I know I can slip every goes,
man,

2778
02:03:05,610 --> 02:03:06,443
you're not permanent shit.
No one's permit almost fucking 

2779
02:03:09,331 --> 02:03:11,310
permanent.
That's why people that have accomplished

2780
02:03:11,311 --> 02:03:12,144
great things and then want to talk about
those great things to the end of time 

2781
02:03:14,821 --> 02:03:17,910
and not do anything anymore.
They're fucking themselves sit.

2782
02:03:18,150 --> 02:03:18,983
Those people that are looking for that 
golden age for that holding hands and 

2783
02:03:21,751 --> 02:03:23,790
walking off into the sunset and credits 
role,

2784
02:03:23,820 --> 02:03:26,520
that doesn't exist.
If not tattooed man,

2785
02:03:26,521 --> 02:03:28,350
it's not real.
I thought it was tattooed.

2786
02:03:28,351 --> 02:03:28,771
I'm like,
fuck,

2787
02:03:28,771 --> 02:03:30,220
I'm slipping.
I'm like,

2788
02:03:30,270 --> 02:03:32,070
what?
I put all this repetition.

2789
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:34,590
I'm still slipping.
Can't take a day off.

2790
02:03:34,620 --> 02:03:35,453
Man.

2791
02:03:35,690 --> 02:03:36,990
Can't take a day off now.

2792
02:03:40,220 --> 02:03:42,150
No days.
Can't take a day off,

2793
02:03:42,210 --> 02:03:44,850
seven days a week.
I get anxious,

2794
02:03:44,970 --> 02:03:47,370
but see the thing about I do active 
recovery,

2795
02:03:47,610 --> 02:03:48,121
right?
Okay.

2796
02:03:48,121 --> 02:03:50,460
So what's a.
What's a light active recovery day?

2797
02:03:50,490 --> 02:03:54,060
You say seven days.
Seven miles is normal and easy.

2798
02:03:54,061 --> 02:03:57,990
Six mile run.
That's active recovery and low low heart

2799
02:03:57,991 --> 02:04:01,040
rate.
I look like I'm walking a mile to like a

2800
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:02,100
fucking nine.
Thirty,

2801
02:04:02,101 --> 02:04:04,680
10 minute mile.
Heart rate's real low.

2802
02:04:04,980 --> 02:04:06,750
I'm really big into the heart rate 
training,

2803
02:04:06,751 --> 02:04:08,160
man.
It's amazing.

2804
02:04:08,580 --> 02:04:12,030
So it makes you a machine.
It makes you a machine man.

2805
02:04:12,031 --> 02:04:12,864
How so?
It trains your heart in a way that the 

2806
02:04:16,561 --> 02:04:17,394
way I was able to run these hundred my 
race like I was able to do it was awful 

2807
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:20,273
heart rate,
so if you go at 80 percent for me for 

2808
02:04:23,491 --> 02:04:25,800
the longest time it was like 100,
like 1:47

2809
02:04:25,801 --> 02:04:29,400
heart rate within 48 to 1:52
right around in there.

2810
02:04:29,850 --> 02:04:30,683
If I maintain that man,
I'm in that I'm burning that nice fat 

2811
02:04:34,561 --> 02:04:38,070
storage and that body wants utilize 
that.

2812
02:04:38,380 --> 02:04:39,213
It wants to burn that nice and slow.
You're never getting that heart rate up 

2813
02:04:41,861 --> 02:04:42,694
pro hockey and get your heart rate up or
how it takes a lot to recover from that 

2814
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:47,730
and hire ghost.
The longer it takes for it to come down.

2815
02:04:48,210 --> 02:04:50,260
We're not staying at 1:45,
1:46

2816
02:04:50,261 --> 02:04:53,400
point 47 heart rate for a long time.
When I get done running,

2817
02:04:53,730 --> 02:04:56,010
it will go back under 100 within two,
three minutes.

2818
02:04:56,630 --> 02:04:58,890
And that's what you want.
You want that quick recovery.

2819
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:01,890
So quick recovery means that your body 
is right on point.

2820
02:05:01,891 --> 02:05:02,724
And I'll look at my and my heart rate.
The morning time it's using the 

2821
02:05:04,981 --> 02:05:06,900
thirties.
If it's like 45,

2822
02:05:06,901 --> 02:05:07,734
46,
47,

2823
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:09,600
I'm overtrained.
Easy day.

2824
02:05:10,230 --> 02:05:13,560
Each day means zone one,
zone one means I'm just going real light

2825
02:05:13,561 --> 02:05:16,440
today.
So I train everyday because why?

2826
02:05:16,770 --> 02:05:17,603
As far as my mind and as a human,
we're supposed to move everyday is 

2827
02:05:21,481 --> 02:05:24,750
supposed to move and I'm not saying get 
after it every day.

2828
02:05:24,990 --> 02:05:25,823
Get after me,
just do something every day or ride a 

2829
02:05:28,081 --> 02:05:30,670
bike.
If you're real tired from working hard,

2830
02:05:30,820 --> 02:05:31,653
right?
An easy Bike spin and as you're 

2831
02:05:32,551 --> 02:05:34,800
spinning,
take in your fluids,

2832
02:05:35,220 --> 02:05:38,940
rehydrate your body as you're active 
because that's the best way to rehydrate

2833
02:05:38,941 --> 02:05:41,850
your body and like taking a carbohydrate
drink.

2834
02:05:43,230 --> 02:05:46,110
It gets all that good carbs.
You start to glycogen,

2835
02:05:46,111 --> 02:05:46,944
store your body again for the next day,
so as you do an active stuff that 

2836
02:05:50,491 --> 02:05:51,324
blood's flowing nice active blood flow,
the blood at the blood flow helps the 

2837
02:05:54,751 --> 02:05:58,260
recovery process along with drinking 
some,

2838
02:05:58,290 --> 02:05:59,123
some like uh,
endurance drink or some carbohydrate 

2839
02:06:01,321 --> 02:06:02,154
drink.
It gets all that glycogen through the 

2840
02:06:03,751 --> 02:06:04,584
system,
back to the muscles loads and back up 

2841
02:06:06,601 --> 02:06:08,880
again,
ready to fight another war tomorrow.

2842
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:10,380
What do you use for a heart rate 
monitor?

2843
02:06:10,870 --> 02:06:15,870
They usually use polar for a long time 
and I kind of still use polar now.

2844
02:06:16,260 --> 02:06:18,300
Is that a wrist one or chester as a 
chest strap?

2845
02:06:18,450 --> 02:06:19,283
It's a nice cheap little gesture app.
And now I'm at a point now where I know 

2846
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:24,600
I only do my heart rate in the morning 
time.

2847
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:26,490
I don't even.
Wherever not run anymore,

2848
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:27,653
do check it with a strap in the morning 
or you check the checkers just so you 

2849
02:06:30,811 --> 02:06:32,890
wake up,
you just put the strap on before you got

2850
02:06:32,891 --> 02:06:34,200
to bed,
put the strap on your body.

2851
02:06:34,930 --> 02:06:36,330
You don't.
The first thing you do,

2852
02:06:36,890 --> 02:06:40,740
put A strap on or do your finger,
whatever one you can do,

2853
02:06:40,741 --> 02:06:43,860
even have a strap to your finger.
Know what your average heart rate is,

2854
02:06:43,930 --> 02:06:45,120
you know,
your resting heart rate.

2855
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:46,810
And then from there,
if it's a little bit higher,

2856
02:06:46,820 --> 02:06:48,270
a little elevated,
you know,

2857
02:06:48,271 --> 02:06:51,570
you can't go off into that zone three 
zone four training day.

2858
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:53,520
You got to keep it at zillow and tours 
on one.

2859
02:06:54,090 --> 02:06:56,700
So it's all about the heart rate,
the resting heart rate.

2860
02:06:56,940 --> 02:06:58,460
So when you use it,
uh,

2861
02:06:58,490 --> 02:06:59,323
the chest strap,
does it register on an application on a 

2862
02:07:01,531 --> 02:07:02,400
phone?
Like how do,

2863
02:07:02,430 --> 02:07:04,290
how do you read it on the watch,
on a watch?

2864
02:07:04,620 --> 02:07:07,170
Is it a smartwatch or as a polar was to 
polar watch.

2865
02:07:07,171 --> 02:07:10,380
So it's a wash that shows you the heart 
rate that's reading off his trap.

2866
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:12,120
Exactly.
So does.

2867
02:07:12,330 --> 02:07:13,950
And so wHen you say zone ones,
this,

2868
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:17,130
these things that you've created,
zone ones onto the normal,

2869
02:07:17,150 --> 02:07:19,650
these are like zones that um,
that's no,

2870
02:07:19,651 --> 02:07:20,770
whoever created this,
like,

2871
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:21,713
like the heart rate zone training.
So basically what I did in help me out 

2872
02:07:26,071 --> 02:07:30,420
so much as my zone two training runs 
used to be an 8:30.

2873
02:07:31,110 --> 02:07:34,460
okay.
So that was my pace at like a 1:45

2874
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:35,313
mile,
30 mile through stretching and give my 

2875
02:07:39,110 --> 02:07:39,943
body opened up.

2876
02:07:41,350 --> 02:07:44,710
My zone to run now is about a seven 
slasH 21,

2877
02:07:44,980 --> 02:07:45,880
seven,
18,

2878
02:07:45,890 --> 02:07:46,723
seven,
19,

2879
02:07:46,760 --> 02:07:47,593
kind of minute off just by opening up 
your range of motion up my range of 

2880
02:07:50,201 --> 02:07:51,370
motion.
Wow.

2881
02:07:51,450 --> 02:07:52,283
Unbelieve at the same exact heart rate.
So my stride and people look at videos 

2882
02:07:55,931 --> 02:07:58,750
and be like years ago when I was first 
doing my first badwater look,

2883
02:07:58,751 --> 02:08:00,400
I was scooting,
I have,

2884
02:08:00,670 --> 02:08:03,700
it was so tight.
I looked at was this very rigid runner.

2885
02:08:04,180 --> 02:08:06,520
Now actually run,
you know,

2886
02:08:06,580 --> 02:08:07,413
everything was so tight.
Everything was contact forming it as I 

2887
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:10,233
was like,
kind of like my knees and my joints is 

2888
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:15,880
going inward now.
EverytHing's where it needs to be at and

2889
02:08:15,881 --> 02:08:18,050
I have a nice long,
nice,

2890
02:08:18,051 --> 02:08:19,720
dried.
Do you run on the street?

2891
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:22,420
I run most part and for the most part 
I'm always traveling.

2892
02:08:22,750 --> 02:08:24,460
So the best thing to do,
get your runnIng shoes.

2893
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:26,020
You'd get your shit and you just go out 
and run.

2894
02:08:26,380 --> 02:08:27,213
But I,
I try to hit the trails some dirt as 

2895
02:08:28,691 --> 02:08:31,060
much as possible.
So this is really good for you.

2896
02:08:31,070 --> 02:08:34,720
But now my body is like fucking tech,
fucking iron.

2897
02:08:35,350 --> 02:08:38,920
I mean it is.
It can take some beatings now when you,

2898
02:08:38,921 --> 02:08:39,754
when you run,
if you ever fuck with those barefoot 

2899
02:08:41,321 --> 02:08:42,930
running shoes.
Oh no,

2900
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:44,530
no,
no,

2901
02:08:44,730 --> 02:08:45,330
no,
no.

2902
02:08:45,330 --> 02:08:46,060
You know what,
like,

2903
02:08:46,060 --> 02:08:47,560
look,
honestly,

2904
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:52,150
I Don't know many people who have been.
I don't believe in it.

2905
02:08:52,540 --> 02:08:54,790
I don't believe I've.
I was born with shoes,

2906
02:08:54,820 --> 02:08:56,470
wearing shoes my whole fucking life.
I'm not,

2907
02:08:56,890 --> 02:09:01,560
you know,
I'm black but I'm not from africa so I,

2908
02:09:01,690 --> 02:09:04,540
I'm not down man.
I'm not dear it.

2909
02:09:04,550 --> 02:09:08,490
Read the science behind the idea of 
using all the muscles in your feet.

2910
02:09:09,310 --> 02:09:10,830
I read the science behind it.
I also read,

2911
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:15,290
sounds like motherfuckers have broken 
feet and heard that too,

2912
02:09:15,550 --> 02:09:18,410
but minimal issues on trails aren't bad.
No they're not.

2913
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:21,070
I'm not doing it now and no man will 
break.

2914
02:09:21,370 --> 02:09:22,630
Oh my god,
man.

2915
02:09:22,860 --> 02:09:24,520
One of those things all the time.
Really?

2916
02:09:24,521 --> 02:09:25,760
Associates.
So you liked them?

2917
02:09:26,010 --> 02:09:27,820
Yeah,
it would kill me,

2918
02:09:27,821 --> 02:09:28,690
man.
I'll tell you what.

2919
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:32,120
Ran in fat tires yesterday under armour 
fat tire,

2920
02:09:32,121 --> 02:09:33,830
which is like a cushiony ass shoe.

2921
02:09:33,900 --> 02:09:35,940
You like it and I was like,
it was so easy.

2922
02:09:36,020 --> 02:09:38,150
It's like it's like whatever.

2923
02:09:38,490 --> 02:09:43,490
I know under armour has these fat tires.
It's basically like a bmx tire track.

2924
02:09:44,851 --> 02:09:47,640
I think it's even made by a tire 
company.

2925
02:09:47,641 --> 02:09:49,770
Makes the tread.
Yeah man.

2926
02:09:49,771 --> 02:09:53,100
It's like it's got a mesh to it and you 
run in these things,

2927
02:09:53,101 --> 02:09:53,934
man.
You could run over.

2928
02:09:54,090 --> 02:09:56,640
See the thing about those five finger 
barefoot shoes.

2929
02:09:57,510 --> 02:09:58,343
I like running those,
but you've got to look where you're 

2930
02:09:59,101 --> 02:10:02,340
stepping.
You can't step on any hard rocks game.

2931
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:03,753
You will fuck up your foot quick cause 
it's like it's gonna go right into your 

2932
02:10:06,601 --> 02:10:08,070
foot.
It's a tiny little thin.

2933
02:10:08,310 --> 02:10:11,730
So I went from those to vivo in vivo 
barefoot shoes.

2934
02:10:11,850 --> 02:10:15,000
That's what it looks like.
So when you run on those bitches,

2935
02:10:15,030 --> 02:10:20,030
that is a cushiony glorious padding.
Like when you,

2936
02:10:20,250 --> 02:10:22,170
when you hit the ground,
it's like smushy,

2937
02:10:22,171 --> 02:10:24,480
smushy smush.
I had the other ones,

2938
02:10:24,481 --> 02:10:25,860
jamie,
the ones with the boa.

2939
02:10:25,890 --> 02:10:26,723
It's cause it's just like got that 
little click one that you just pulled 

2940
02:10:29,210 --> 02:10:29,670
out.
YeaH,

2941
02:10:29,670 --> 02:10:32,280
like those.
So it's like you twisted with that.

2942
02:10:32,281 --> 02:10:34,080
That's how you tighten it with that 
little boa,

2943
02:10:34,081 --> 02:10:34,914
a adjuster thing.
It's like a got a thread through it so 

2944
02:10:37,071 --> 02:10:38,390
you have to lace it or anything like 
that.

2945
02:10:38,391 --> 02:10:40,880
It just slip them on and pop that sucker
down.

2946
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,190
I like to feel the ground a little bit 
when I run.

2947
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:44,750
Yeah,
he barely feeling shit with those.

2948
02:10:46,850 --> 02:10:47,683
But I like it.
My joints didn't bother me at all 

2949
02:10:50,511 --> 02:10:51,570
yesterday,
which is crazy.

2950
02:10:51,571 --> 02:10:52,404
Like after a good solid run because most
what I'm running is hills pretty steep 

2951
02:10:57,020 --> 02:10:57,853
and it's great.
My ass and legs never been waiting away 

2952
02:10:59,510 --> 02:11:00,650
right now.
200.

2953
02:11:01,050 --> 02:11:02,120
You think?
Dude man.

2954
02:11:02,180 --> 02:11:03,620
Now.
So for me,

2955
02:11:03,621 --> 02:11:05,870
the pounding of the,
you know,

2956
02:11:05,871 --> 02:11:06,704
the,
the constant pounding the feet to the 

2957
02:11:08,421 --> 02:11:10,130
ground,
it is a,

2958
02:11:10,250 --> 02:11:11,780
it's,
it's rough on the ankles.

2959
02:11:11,781 --> 02:11:12,614
It's rough on the joints,
but I don't feel it at all with those 

2960
02:11:15,351 --> 02:11:17,090
fat tires.
It was like I,

2961
02:11:17,270 --> 02:11:18,920
I got done running.
I felt like I cheated.

2962
02:11:20,180 --> 02:11:22,800
I felt like wow,
this is so much eAsier.

2963
02:11:22,830 --> 02:11:24,510
The cloud shoes.
Yeah.

2964
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:28,850
This just real cushiony and cams always 
said that he runs with those a lot.

2965
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:29,390
Oh,
does he?

2966
02:11:29,390 --> 02:11:31,040
Yeah,
he's running with a bunch of those.

2967
02:11:31,180 --> 02:11:33,350
He's like,
because he runs so many fuckIng miles.

2968
02:11:33,351 --> 02:11:36,680
He was running a marathon a day,
like pretty much every day.

2969
02:11:36,740 --> 02:11:38,510
I did that for awhile back.

2970
02:11:39,370 --> 02:11:44,370
Oh my god,
I got wired in doing that shit man.

2971
02:11:44,860 --> 02:11:46,950
What is this right here?
So this is,

2972
02:11:47,720 --> 02:11:52,420
this is when I ran,
I ran a hundred and 50 mile trail race.

2973
02:11:53,110 --> 02:11:57,250
So the year before I did the same race.
It's 150 mile trail race.

2974
02:11:57,251 --> 02:12:02,251
I did it in I think around a 40 hours 
and I had to walk the last 60 miles.

2975
02:12:02,590 --> 02:12:04,450
got I,
I had pneumonia.

2976
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:05,790
Here we go.
Yeah.

2977
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:08,860
Well,
and then I told the race director,

2978
02:12:09,430 --> 02:12:11,500
hey motherfucker,
I'm coming back here next year,

2979
02:12:11,700 --> 02:12:15,160
now I'm breaking the course record.
I went back and did like 32 hours.

2980
02:12:16,420 --> 02:12:17,253
Same race.

2981
02:12:18,790 --> 02:12:19,623
Wow.

2982
02:12:21,230 --> 02:12:22,110
No,
no.

2983
02:12:22,111 --> 02:12:24,600
When you were Thirty three hours.
So when you run in,

2984
02:12:24,660 --> 02:12:25,493
what shoes do you use?
Right now I'm wearing brooks and also 

2985
02:12:28,531 --> 02:12:31,050
we're a six.
So it just depends on,

2986
02:12:31,070 --> 02:12:32,910
you know,
what kind of train I'm in,

2987
02:12:33,100 --> 02:12:34,200
where I'm at,
stuff like that.

2988
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:36,630
For trails where you were running for 
trails.

2989
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:37,553
I actually,
for the longest time I roar a street 

2990
02:12:39,751 --> 02:12:41,290
running shoe.
Really?

2991
02:12:41,370 --> 02:12:42,300
For trails?
Yeah,

2992
02:12:42,301 --> 02:12:44,010
for the longest time.
How come?

2993
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:46,320
Because first of all my body was so 
messed up.

2994
02:12:46,321 --> 02:12:48,690
The only issue I could ever wear with 
this brooks addiction.

2995
02:12:49,220 --> 02:12:50,053
It hate even given brooks credit right 
now because back in the day they would 

2996
02:12:53,431 --> 02:12:55,230
help a brother out.
I was running so many miles.

2997
02:12:55,231 --> 02:12:55,921
Yeah.
So brooke's.

2998
02:12:55,921 --> 02:12:57,690
I'm not trying to.
I'm not promoting brooks right now.

2999
02:12:58,410 --> 02:12:59,950
Yeah.
Merry christmas on that one.

3000
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:02,100
I called up the meantimes times.
Hey man,

3001
02:13:02,101 --> 02:13:03,780
can I get like a discount or some shit?

3002
02:13:04,050 --> 02:13:05,390
Hang up.
Nobody.

3003
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:06,233
Nothing.
So,

3004
02:13:06,420 --> 02:13:09,260
but they do have a good shoe and I,
uh,

3005
02:13:09,330 --> 02:13:10,163
and I,
and it was not good pr it horrible pr 

3006
02:13:12,331 --> 02:13:13,410
man,
you know what I'm saying?

3007
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:14,190
Like,
you know,

3008
02:13:14,190 --> 02:13:15,600
so,
but um,

3009
02:13:15,690 --> 02:13:16,523
yeah,
I love their shoe bonus check or where 

3010
02:13:17,230 --> 02:13:18,680
was that?
Brooks addiction can.

3011
02:13:18,700 --> 02:13:20,760
My,
my biomechanics was so messed up.

3012
02:13:20,761 --> 02:13:21,594
I tried so many different shoes and,
and that was a so I can now wear a 

3013
02:13:24,871 --> 02:13:28,800
neutral shoe.
So how I used to run and very few people

3014
02:13:28,801 --> 02:13:33,360
know this,
I used to have heel inserts,

3015
02:13:33,420 --> 02:13:34,253
heel wedges and get compression tape 
because my body was pushed so far in 

3016
02:13:39,391 --> 02:13:42,240
from being so tight in my hip flexors 
that.

3017
02:13:42,241 --> 02:13:46,650
So how I guess that's best dressed 
fractures was my bottom mccastle there's

3018
02:13:46,651 --> 02:13:48,150
a picture of my toe in there.
Can my,

3019
02:13:48,510 --> 02:13:50,720
my toes is Jan in front of my shoes,
can.

3020
02:13:50,730 --> 02:13:51,563
My whole body has got this like bent in.
So when you say in benton for people 

3021
02:13:55,930 --> 02:13:59,490
just listening your.
If your hands are flat on a table,

3022
02:13:59,491 --> 02:14:04,491
you're turning the outside of your hands
in so that your thumbs are going down.

3023
02:14:04,650 --> 02:14:05,451
Those are my.
So yeah.

3024
02:14:05,451 --> 02:14:07,350
So those are my two big toes,
right?

3025
02:14:07,351 --> 02:14:10,620
Going down,
going down into the shoe and the outside

3026
02:14:10,621 --> 02:14:12,390
of your foot was up.
Was above it.

3027
02:14:12,450 --> 02:14:14,040
Right?
So what I had to do to run,

3028
02:14:14,041 --> 02:14:15,030
because I was like,
god,

3029
02:14:15,031 --> 02:14:18,570
I got stress fractures all time and my 
feet were so fucked up.

3030
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:20,220
Sometimes you see that with peopLe's 
shoes,

3031
02:14:20,221 --> 02:14:21,780
like how they're worn out,
worn out,

3032
02:14:21,781 --> 02:14:24,930
worn out on a sideways example.
Like a wedge,

3033
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:26,910
right?
Can we look at it from behind the crazy?

3034
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,080
Yeah.
That was my shoe.

3035
02:14:28,081 --> 02:14:32,120
So I had to get a heel wedge to keep my 
heel from going down.

3036
02:14:32,150 --> 02:14:32,983
Guys sit.
Severe tendinitis in the back of my 

3037
02:14:34,360 --> 02:14:35,580
ankle.
That's actually,

3038
02:14:35,581 --> 02:14:40,260
you had to make it thicker on one side 
on the inside flat.

3039
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:41,260
Right?
So the insight,

3040
02:14:41,280 --> 02:14:43,440
I had a pushup and had to get 
compression tape.

3041
02:14:43,800 --> 02:14:47,370
So it was compression tape,
heel wedges and an insert.

3042
02:14:48,060 --> 02:14:48,893
And that's how I ran every fucking day.
And then did you go to a running coach 

3043
02:14:51,871 --> 02:14:53,070
or anything digital?
No,

3044
02:14:56,870 --> 02:14:59,310
but did you want to know what you were 
doing wrong?

3045
02:14:59,311 --> 02:15:00,001
You know what,
man,

3046
02:15:00,001 --> 02:15:01,770
that was part of that.
Granted more mindset,

3047
02:15:01,771 --> 02:15:02,521
man.
Fuck it,

3048
02:15:02,521 --> 02:15:03,480
man.
I'm supposEd to be broken.

3049
02:15:03,920 --> 02:15:04,753
No,
but then I got smarter as time went and 

3050
02:15:07,630 --> 02:15:12,120
him and this is painful shit.
Running 100 mile races with this kind of

3051
02:15:12,121 --> 02:15:15,120
tendonitis and my feet being fucked up.
It was so painful.

3052
02:15:15,870 --> 02:15:16,660
So I was like,
no way.

3053
02:15:16,660 --> 02:15:18,960
So then that's what started stretching.
I was like,

3054
02:15:18,961 --> 02:15:21,120
my god,
all this was from having a tie.

3055
02:15:21,180 --> 02:15:22,560
I got so mad.
Oh my god,

3056
02:15:22,561 --> 02:15:23,394
I wasn't.
I wasn't all these different 

3057
02:15:24,031 --> 02:15:27,120
contraptions and now I just wear a 
number of running shoe.

3058
02:15:27,780 --> 02:15:28,770
Wow.
yeah.

3059
02:15:28,830 --> 02:15:31,350
So I went from being contraption up,
man,

3060
02:15:31,890 --> 02:15:32,723
like literally contraption up.
So it's all just the stretching that 

3061
02:15:35,551 --> 02:15:36,384
opened up the range of motion.
Now when people talk about range of 

3062
02:15:39,811 --> 02:15:43,080
motion,
they don't understand how tight I was,

3063
02:15:43,110 --> 02:15:43,943
like no one understands.
Like when you repeatedly do what I was 

3064
02:15:47,611 --> 02:15:52,080
doing to myself and you were born with 
the stress I was born under,

3065
02:15:52,620 --> 02:15:54,930
like I hate.
I can't paint a clear.

3066
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:57,900
It's pretty clear in the book,
man.

3067
02:15:58,290 --> 02:16:01,180
My life was bad.
the stress I adored on daily.

3068
02:16:01,340 --> 02:16:02,173
I had two people and my body was proof 
of literally what my life was doing to 

3069
02:16:07,591 --> 02:16:08,424
me.
It literally was not at all my muscles 

3070
02:16:10,591 --> 02:16:12,780
up because I was always under this fight
or flight,

3071
02:16:13,170 --> 02:16:13,660
you know,
my,

3072
02:16:13,660 --> 02:16:16,470
my dad had made me so fucking scared as 
shit,

3073
02:16:17,190 --> 02:16:17,940
you know,
to,

3074
02:16:17,940 --> 02:16:19,560
to unwind this motherfucker.

3075
02:16:19,560 --> 02:16:21,630
Man was like,
it was,

3076
02:16:21,631 --> 02:16:23,040
it was,
it was a hard task.

3077
02:16:23,100 --> 02:16:23,670
You know,
I,

3078
02:16:23,670 --> 02:16:26,040
it was hard.
It was a hard task man.

3079
02:16:26,041 --> 02:16:29,650
So it's a lot of damage.
It's not just all the hard training,

3080
02:16:29,950 --> 02:16:32,410
but it's also the mind,
the mind because think about it,

3081
02:16:32,411 --> 02:16:33,520
man,
when you're under stress,

3082
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:34,953
that hip flexor with that,
that's so as most western attached to 

3083
02:16:37,241 --> 02:16:41,770
your t 12 that that's the only muscle 
that attaches your lower body,

3084
02:16:42,010 --> 02:16:45,400
upper body and that's the muscle that's,
that's your fight or flight.

3085
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:47,740
Whenever you get nervouS or scared or 
something like that.

3086
02:16:47,741 --> 02:16:49,060
That motherfucker's business was tighten
up.

3087
02:16:49,540 --> 02:16:50,373
your whole body is.
I lived in that like almost fetal 

3088
02:16:52,841 --> 02:16:53,674
position in my mind for so many years.
So I was always under this tight neck 

3089
02:16:58,720 --> 02:17:03,070
tension fucking guy.
But I walked around like I'm some cool.

3090
02:17:03,490 --> 02:17:06,090
Here's my new hairstyle,
pesticide.

3091
02:17:06,270 --> 02:17:07,510
I'm a cool dude man.

3092
02:17:08,260 --> 02:17:12,360
But that was not a costume.
The costume where every day get tired of

3093
02:17:12,370 --> 02:17:13,181
tighter.

3094
02:17:13,181 --> 02:17:14,014
man.
Next costume I want you to be in as a 

3095
02:17:15,400 --> 02:17:18,070

I'm going to send you a picture,

3096
02:17:18,071 --> 02:17:18,904

3097
02:17:21,210 --> 02:17:24,530
