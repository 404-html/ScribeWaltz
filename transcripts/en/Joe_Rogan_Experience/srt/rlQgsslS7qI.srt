1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,960
The joe rogan experience stay.

2
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:03,840
However those two broads
I live next to you,

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,950
maybe with a tall German check that was
lanky and cue the short Brunette and

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,220
then there was the Chubby or check sage.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:13,883
Remember the Chubby

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,440
like heroin or something
with them or something.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,880
He did everything [inaudible]

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,480
I stopped there.

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,120
Sage is the one I did like sage's father.

10
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:31,320
I one time was the rolling stones' manager
and what he did for this chick was he

11
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:36,210
bought her a fucking blockbuster and
Ventura blockbuster and she said,

12
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:37,020
I don't want to block.

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,970
Turned her on to heroin
and she was herpes herpes.

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,740
I didn't give him no fucking herpes.

15
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,920
She was giving me shit about having her.

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,230
She's over there and fucking Oh,

17
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:53,840
heroin with Joey Diaz to me.

18
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,243
I was,

19
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,450
I used to lie was homeless.

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,850
So she would come to the store on Sundays.

21
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,240
She would come to the store on Sundays
and give me pills and she would,

22
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:06,720
she was an expert in mixing.

23
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:07,381
What was that shit?

24
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:09,030
That was big year MDB,

25
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:09,983
a

26
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,870
ecstasy with water.

27
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:14,760
She drinking none of the other stuff.

28
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,613
Does

29
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,310
she bring it to the comedy store and I'd
be hosting on Sundays and she'd give me

30
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:21,360
drinks of the GSP.

31
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,223
Whatever the fuck

32
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:26,700
happened.

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,930
This one off for six months.

34
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,320
She take HB and really go to a house.

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,250
Rogan,

36
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,290
I go to a house on Sundays after I'd host,

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:34,951
she come down,

38
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:36,090
we buy coke from Chile.

39
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,170
We'd go to Ralph's,

40
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:37,851
we'd do heroin,

41
00:01:37,851 --> 00:01:39,810
eat her ass pills.

42
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,530
She has little shows at lingerie for me.

43
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,090
She was a hundred pounds overweight.

44
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:45,924
But this bitch

45
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,030
ass you want to eat?

46
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,550
No,

47
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,750
no,

48
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,583
no.

49
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,940
I didn't see it for a long time.

50
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,950
She started coming
around to Calistoga GSP.

51
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,450
So one fuck Liz is a great story.

52
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,230
I about this.

53
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,790
I was thinking about staying
hope on the way up here.

54
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,660
And uh,

55
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,150
our friend Mike was selling weed,

56
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,130
but then one time he
worked at CAA and he goes,

57
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:08,401
listen,

58
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:09,560
one of the interns over to him,

59
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,403
he blew up.

60
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,420
He ended up being Whitney
Houston's manager and you know,

61
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,890
and the tour manager and he,

62
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:16,950
he's looking for powder.

63
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,870
So every day they would come over and
I would sell Bobby Brown and Whitney

64
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,220
Houston.

65
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:22,500
You know,

66
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,320
they would come over like
$1,100 which was per diem money.

67
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,690
I was taking Whitney's per diem money,

68
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:28,020
right?

69
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,330
Every day they come over with a little
white envelope and give me the per diem

70
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,601
money,

71
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:35,320
and I go up to the Martell
cartel and I buy 14 grams of Blo,

72
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,820
take an eight ball out and cut it
and then give it to Whitney Houston.

73
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,830
And they were fucking going crazy.

74
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:41,041
They,

75
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,780
this went on for 30 40 days,

76
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,740
but I couldn't snort all the blog was,

77
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,480
I couldn't start it.

78
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,360
It was just too much.

79
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,490
So I was giving it to Maldon Martinez,

80
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:52,520
the whole dad.

81
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:53,630
She's done.

82
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,720
That's the coke that killed her.

83
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,430
So,

84
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,263
okay,

85
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,980
I got,

86
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,420
I got like two ounces of bloat,

87
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,790
plus I snorted all this
coke and I can't it no more.

88
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,640
What did I call him,

89
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:07,350
Marilyn?

90
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,140
I go Maryland,

91
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,000
bring the club down to the fucking store.

92
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:10,630
Right.

93
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:15,540
I'm selling coke to Whitney fucking dad
picking me up at nine in the morning,

94
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,270
paging me on the red page or I'm coming
downstairs getting in a car with them,

95
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:23,440
going to the Martell cartel
to the brothers going in
the house with two grams of

96
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:27,330
coke already cut in my pocket and
I would just go and take rock sack,

97
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:29,710
throw the cutter and mix it up and give
it right back to them in the car and

98
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:30,640
they'd be happy as shit.

99
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,460
They were invited me to a and m
records to come party with them.

100
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:34,294
I don't party.

101
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,580
I was selling them.

102
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,850
I was getting him a half ounce and
taking an eight ball out and throwing an

103
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:40,750
eight ball of cutting.

104
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,830
What does an eight ball?

105
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,760
Three and a half grams.

106
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,150
So I haven't done coke my entire
fucking life and I don't know like a

107
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:48,830
percentage,

108
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,830
like what it cost.

109
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,750
Percentages are

110
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,330
sleazy that it's all cut.

111
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,000
No,

112
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,833
no,

113
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:57,910
no.

114
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,620
What it not go with a fucking shit
like coke because someone goes,

115
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:02,741
Hey,

116
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:03,820
do you want to do a bump?

117
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,391
And you go,

118
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:05,224
okay,

119
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,810
but you don't know what he's never bought.

120
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,210
When you go out with Stan,

121
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,510
hope somebody got cokes,

122
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:11,090
he'll do coke.

123
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,790
He got an elephant tranquilizer.

124
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:13,860
Stan,

125
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,621
what was I going to go?

126
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:14,870
Joy.

127
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,703
We don't give a fuck.

128
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,990
The train's already running.

129
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,370
I got nowhere to be tomorrow.

130
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,330
Fuck it.

131
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,110
We're here already.

132
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:20,381
You know what?

133
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:22,150
I got to and he said he had mushrooms.

134
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:22,421
I'm like,

135
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:23,170
what the fuck you don't.

136
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:23,650
You should.

137
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,560
This is the cock sucker and knocks on
your door with rolling papers and no weed.

138
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,393
You know what I'm saying?

139
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,081
Like I got no rule.

140
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:28,440
Like,

141
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,680
like a rolling papers.

142
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,740
Next time you bring those fucking
mushrooms with you and we could have been

143
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:34,900
right here on this would have
been a great fucking podcast,

144
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:35,710
not the lizard.

145
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,610
So I'm Robyn Whitney and Bobby
Brown for a fucking month.

146
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:41,020
I'm robbing that blow every day.

147
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,950
I can't do it.

148
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,970
I can't snort it fast.

149
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,863
How much are they doing?

150
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,400
They're doing a half ounce a day.

151
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,810
This is why this is God,

152
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:47,843
I need this.

153
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,160
No,

154
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,993
this is [inaudible].

155
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,280
They're doing a half ounce a day,

156
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:52,810
which is three ounces a week.

157
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,800
Oh my God.

158
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,820
And singing.

159
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,720
What does that look like?

160
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,120
Whoa.

161
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,190
Announces like this.

162
00:04:57,191 --> 00:04:57,500
Like,

163
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,250
oh I guess like a half ounce of weed.

164
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:00,970
Like they're doing,

165
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,320
they're doing one of those a day.

166
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,241
Bobby Brown,

167
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:05,230
his face twisted.

168
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,150
And I was getting this
shit that was flaky.

169
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:08,330
So my God,

170
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,183
so right.

171
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,470
I tell Marilyn and bring the coin,

172
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:13,923
aren't they?

173
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,390
Aren't they feeding an
entourage at this point?

174
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,610
Think about coke.

175
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,533
It's just those two.

176
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,810
There's only so much coke left.

177
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,151
All right,

178
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:22,751
you gotta go,

179
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:23,411
you gotta go.

180
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:24,070
You get to go.

181
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,431
Right.

182
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:25,610
So this went on,

183
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,670
so on Saturday and I
called Marilyn Martinez.

184
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:27,851
I go,

185
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:28,251
Marilyn,

186
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:28,751
do me a favor,

187
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:31,520
bring the blow to the comedy store
cause I'm just going to sell it.

188
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,460
And a kid after my set gives me a little
Baggie with the bottom of it filled up,

189
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:38,650
like not even,

190
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,700
not even two lines.

191
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,980
And I put it in my pocket
and I take it home.

192
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:42,521
When I get home,

193
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:43,240
I do it.

194
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,961
It's not coke,

195
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:44,794
it's crank.

196
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,930
So I'm on fire now.

197
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:47,741
It's three in the morning.

198
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:49,300
I'm in my house on fire.

199
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,510
I got the coke kit and she
hasn't stopped shaking.

200
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,380
Sings all right,

201
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:55,240
I have the coke in the fucking car.

202
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:55,930
No I'm not.

203
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,763
I'm not bouncing.

204
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,540
I the coping the car earlier,

205
00:05:58,890 --> 00:05:59,780
I always do that shit.

206
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:00,890
I have to talking in the car.

207
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:01,580
Right.

208
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,960
And I wouldn't bring it upstairs.

209
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,170
Right.

210
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,230
I don't like coke in my house.

211
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,860
I would go down and do a little
bumper about five in the morning.

212
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,040
You would always keep it in the
car and the car ride guy thing.

213
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,170
I don't like it was about how backer Tom,

214
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,760
I don't like this.

215
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:12,900
My,

216
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,880
I don't need to be parents,

217
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,260
but I don't like it in my house anyway.

218
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,440
I never like Copeland mine.

219
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:17,010
It's just bad.

220
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:17,331
Vital,

221
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:18,020
make it right.

222
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,840
I used to leave it outside on the
rocks and somebody else's garage.

223
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,330
Then I'm a go in and do a
bump and go back upstairs.

224
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,490
So there's one night I got to stay in
the pages going off and it's sage and I

225
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:28,701
said,

226
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:29,030
fuck it.

227
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,160
Let me just bring the two
ounces to our house a blow.

228
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,020
And I brought at that time,

229
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:35,210
it was like an ounce and
a half and three quarters.

230
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,590
This bitch pick me up at six in the
morning with a case of Starbucks,

231
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:40,510
coffee and Kevin,

232
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,750
half a gallon of the rocket.

233
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:47,470
And we went back to the house and we did
that whole package of Blo Heroin Valley

234
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,110
Ams and Vma GSP.

235
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,301
How many days?

236
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:53,931
How many days?

237
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:55,790
Who days just to dog day.

238
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:56,331
Afternoon.

239
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:57,560
I had to get Scott Wolfe,

240
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:57,830
uh,

241
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,663
Josh moves,

242
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,240
brother Fredo to come get me
over by the directors guild.

243
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,051
Oh my God.

244
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:04,850
The two days I puked till Thursday.

245
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,280
Jesus Christ is how sick I was.

246
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,070
The fucking Houston's kept
calling me and I'm like,

247
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:10,990
fuck you motherfuckers.

248
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,840
I'm out of commission.

249
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:12,500
Right.

250
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,750
So finally that wex week was the grammys.

251
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,220
This is the last time I seen them.

252
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,980
I don't think I told you
about this last time ever.

253
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,060
I seen Whitney Houston.

254
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,690
I got a call on a Monday morning after
the grammys at nine in the morning.

255
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,651
And they're like,

256
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:25,420
is your boy up?

257
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,230
He'd have to be come get me.

258
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,400
And they pull up to my fucking house
where I live by the Yfca and it was the

259
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:32,234
manager,

260
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,020
Whitney Houston and Ricky Martin in
the fucking back and they're all gone.

261
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,190
They're gone from the Grammy's that jaw,

262
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,150
all them jaws are fucking goal and
Jack and I got in the car with them.

263
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:45,550
I drive for the Martell cocktail.

264
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,300
Him sitting there like,

265
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,610
oh,

266
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,730
I don't even know what drinking more.

267
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,130
I just looked out the window.

268
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:50,660
I was more paranoid than he was.

269
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,741
I got in,

270
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:52,161
bought it,

271
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:53,290
brought it back to the college.

272
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,630
That's the last time I
fucking see that shit.

273
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:55,971
All right.

274
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:56,181
With that,

275
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:57,530
I'm looking at all these images.

276
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,530
Probably not fucking
start defamation suits.

277
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,930
That's a defamation snaky
fucking Martin or whatever.

278
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,390
It's a two story would definitely.

279
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,620
If it didn't fucking happen,

280
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:07,454
then it wouldn't give it up.

281
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,200
Lucky Martin clean and sober now.

282
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:10,160
He came out of the closet,

283
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:10,994
has got kids,

284
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,390
so look these opinions and stories and
not a representative of the Joe Rogan.

285
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,263
What the fuck is,

286
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,910
I was actually promoting copyrighted
stuff and what is the [inaudible]?

287
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,580
This story might think that you always,

288
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,260
individuals date the fucking beat.

289
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,710
This story's going to get on the Internet.

290
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,100
No,

291
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,120

293
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:33,441

294
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:36,890

295
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:54,840
Okay.

296
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,840
[inaudible]

297
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,350
freaks and Geeks.

298
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:11,101
Lovers and children.

299
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:12,540
What's going on ladies and gentlemen?
