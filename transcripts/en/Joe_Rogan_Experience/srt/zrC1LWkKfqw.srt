1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,660
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,250
Everybody's so like hyper aware of
themselves and like they're so afraid to

3
00:00:06,251 --> 00:00:07,480
laugh at fucking anything.

4
00:00:07,481 --> 00:00:08,020
You know?

5
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:08,831
There's a lot of that,

6
00:00:08,831 --> 00:00:10,360
but there's a lot of cool
people out there too.

7
00:00:10,361 --> 00:00:12,940
It's just got to figure out
how to attract only them.

8
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:13,221
Well,

9
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,390
you have a cool audience,

10
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:14,620
dude.

11
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,700
I mean honestly I don't know how I pulled
it off for a cooler crowd and you play

12
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:21,700
like some really cool off the
wall venues and that that's,

13
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,511
that's what it's about.

14
00:00:22,511 --> 00:00:22,900
You know,

15
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,410
I always hear from waitresses and
it's one of the coolest things ever.

16
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,970
I always hear from waitresses that my
people are nice and generous tippers.

17
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:31,990
I love that.

18
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:32,560
That is,

19
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:32,861
to me,

20
00:00:32,861 --> 00:00:36,100
that is the ultimate compliment
that somehow or another of of,

21
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:40,180
of accumulated a bunch of Nice people and
understood the greatest thing that can

22
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:41,014
ever pull off.

23
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:41,801
Well they love it.

24
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:42,990
Like when your crowd are good drunks,

25
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,690
like my crowd.

26
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,070
Yeah,

27
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:44,903
master drunks.

28
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,780
They know what the fuck to
do with the little kids.

29
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,480
He's the first person I saw
studies stand up because of that.

30
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,480
It really being a the insomnia
show and he caught me.

31
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:55,920
I recording him cause I didn't,

32
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,830
I never went to a comedy show so I
didn't know like what do you like?

33
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,600
I was used to bands.

34
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,600
I'd always try to sneak my camcorder in
and try to take something like a clip or

35
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:04,230
something.

36
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,380
So going to be $8 on stage.

37
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:07,950
The videos,

38
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:08,781
him pointing at me,

39
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:08,971
he goes,

40
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:10,140
hey you have with the camera.

41
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:10,974
I turned out

42
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,920
I wanted to bring that clip.

43
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:17,790
I forgot that should have brought that
bloody probably was fatter and just like

44
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:18,624
all puffy.

45
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:19,561
I love that.

46
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:19,981
I love that.

47
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:22,560
Like 20 pounds of booze on the puffiness.

48
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:23,880
It's really not the booze,

49
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:26,850
it's the Burger and fries and more fries.

50
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:28,560
And then of course you've
got to have a piece of cake,

51
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:29,743
you know,

52
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,560
porn for your stomach.

53
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,310
Oh,

54
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,031

55
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:33,301

56
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,010
I eat like several people.

57
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,241
You know,

58
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:38,040
like when I do a two show Saturday night,

59
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:38,341

60
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:39,174

61
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,230
repressive,

62
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,850
ridiculous amounts of food where people,

63
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,190
they don't even don't only
think I'm being honest,

64
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,270
the waitress three times to honor,

65
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,160

66
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:48,600
I want a steak and I want a chicken.

67
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:48,961
I'll wait.

68
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:49,950
Here is always leaves.

69
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:51,630
You're like,

70
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,200
I'm not done.

71
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,950
And then yeah,

72
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,650
I order stupid amounts
of food after gigs man.

73
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,401

76
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,330
Fuck,

77
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,061
I love officers.

78
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:04,030
Would crazy amounts of butter on them.

79
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:07,960
Do just slather that shit and
butter cover that motherfucker.

80
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,570
Maple Syrup and I'm not really
down with those Belgium waffles.

81
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,760
I like the waffles they give
you when you go to Roscoe's.

82
00:02:12,761 --> 00:02:13,990
Roscoe's chicken and Waffles,

83
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,400
they have the thin waffles.

84
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,140
Waffles are the real deal.

85
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:19,630
Those big stupid Belgium waffles.

86
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,140
Those puffy fucking stupid
waffles did too much show.

87
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,051
That's all you got.

88
00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:29,320
I'll take the Belgium waffle but God
dammit regular waffles or better.

89
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,080
What's your stays?

90
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,240
What's your late I was like,

91
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:31,571
well you know,

92
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:34,000
cause I was professional
drunk so it'd be like a,

93
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:34,480
you know,

94
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,130
lots of meat I needed to me to like fight
the booze and my stomach but it always

95
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:41,930
came up shitting blood and just horrible.

96
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:42,640
You know,

97
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,160
fucking just like how
many times you shed blood.

98
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,410
I'd say like,

99
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,030
I've shipped blood for weeks.

100
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,950
Oh my God.

101
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,783
Then I've shipped,

102
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,481
you know,

103
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:52,010
being a crime,

104
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,760
like you don't have healthcare so
you gotta kind of like do your own

105
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,190
analysis to taste it too sweet.

106
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,020
I do my own kind of,

107
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,060
maybe I need less oranges in my diet,

108
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,541

109
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,220

112
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:09,910
but I definitely meet was the thing that
would help me fucking fight the booze.

113
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:12,160
But I'll tell you like now

You know?

123

Do you try to eat healthy?

124
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,390

I'm chain smoking,

134
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:36,490
drinking black fucking coffee here.

135
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:37,450
Like coffee's good for us.

136
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,521

137
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:39,920

00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,220

142
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,710
like he's still bleeding now.

143
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,660
I only bleed for the economy.

144
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,780
I have a job troops for Joe,

145
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:51,340
I believe for the troops and the economy.

146
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,150
We know jobs.

147
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,601
When you,

148
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:53,080
um,

149
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,591
you know,

150
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:55,810
you just sort of let it stop bleeding.

151
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:56,291
No,

152
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:56,610
it just,

153
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:56,940
you know,

154
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,310
whatever,

155
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,143
it's,

156
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,501
I don't know.

157
00:03:58,501 --> 00:03:59,820
You're your to come up blood brother.

158
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,020
I did the same thing.

159
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:01,854
And like for me,

160
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,593
I,

161
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,240
it happens for weeks for me to

162
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,201
honestly,

163
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:07,471
I mean,

164
00:04:07,471 --> 00:04:08,370
I'm just amazed.

165
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:10,200
I'm still alive and
like the fact that like,

166
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:10,410
you know,

167
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,670
I'm so self destructive,

168
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,720
like my mother,

169
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:13,200
you know,

170
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,130
she's such a sweetheart,

171
00:04:14,131 --> 00:04:14,310
like,

172
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:14,630
you know,

173
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,150
I kinda like,

174
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,230
we're responsible for her.

175
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,150
So that's like the only thing
that keeps me from like,

176
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:19,920
crossing that line of like,

177
00:04:19,921 --> 00:04:20,101
you know,

178
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:21,360
like fuck yeah,

179
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,530
I'm going to huff paint.

180
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,363
And you know,

181
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,271
I mean,

182
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:24,871
because honestly,

183
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:25,351
you know,

184
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:28,020
when you're a comic and you're
out there balls deep in the road,

185
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:28,770
it's like,

186
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,610
do you really care?

187
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:29,851
You know,

188
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:31,920
it's like you just looking
for the next fucking wild.

189
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,730
It's fun.

190
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,120
It is fun now.

191
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:37,530
It's,

192
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:37,800
yeah,

193
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,680
now it's fun to have a bunch of shots
with some people and kind of do high five

194
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:44,330
and the problem is the next day.

195
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,360
Yeah.

196
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,320
And that's the problem.

197
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,580
But then now you get older,

198
00:04:47,581 --> 00:04:47,851
right?

199
00:04:47,851 --> 00:04:49,720
And like you got a mortgage
and you've got to do,

200
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:49,980
you know,

201
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,330
you got kids and everything like that.

202
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:51,780
It's like,

203
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,120
ah,

204
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,770
I just wished blues didn't do any damage.

205
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:55,840
I wish booze was like weed or you did it.

206
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:57,460
You never felt the next day you're fine.

207
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,450
Well because we're American,

208
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,660
we fucking work hard and we
drink hard and we and we,

209
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,261
and we're like,

210
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:02,680
fuck you.

211
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,513
We have the right to do it.

212
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,151
Cause your,

213
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:06,490
someone could reengineer booze.

214
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,791
You know,

215
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,640
some scientists need to get on this
whole Buddhist thing and figure it out.

216
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,230
Give me the effects of booze,

217
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:11,891
you know,

218
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:13,150
make it tastes like booze.

219
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:15,340
But figuring out a way where
it doesn't wreck your system.

220
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,400
There's gotta be a way to
recreate being drunk without,

221
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,190
without making you just poisoned.

222
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,030
You know?

223
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,530
I mean really,

224
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,590
where we're so retarded,

225
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:24,670
we go poison each other.

226
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,170
It has like so many good effects for it.

227
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:28,280
But it was never my drug.

228
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:28,820
But I like,

229
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,700
I totally am like,

230
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,550
we're all like,

231
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,510
lot of guys don't get
him our don't like it.

232
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:33,740
Rather Stan hope doesn't like it.

233
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,011
Yeah,

234
00:05:34,011 --> 00:05:35,330
no we were boozing and like,

235
00:05:35,331 --> 00:05:36,200
you know drug guys,

236
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:36,710
we weren't going to,

237
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,580
what was it though about the
weed that you didn't like?

238
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,890
Well no offense,

239
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,540
but I thought it was kind of prissy.

240
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,220
I always thought it was a sit around and
like there's something about weed and

241
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,400
like sitting on a couch and then all of
a sudden there's a guitar there for some

242
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:51,560
reason and then now you're
hearing a million parodies.

243
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,210
You're hearing a million fucking ditties
and everyone's giggling and then they

244
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,293
even don't.

245
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,780
But if you're hanging around with
the idiots and they get high,

246
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:00,320
you're right.

247
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,600
You're in for some profound stupidity.

248
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,900
But I think it facilitates thinking.

249
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,530
Definitely.

250
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,050
I can show you how a lot of people don't
like it cause it makes you paranoid

251
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:09,680
though,

252
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,460
because it can,

253
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,690
it's if you're not into that,

254
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:12,950
if you're not in to looking at yourself,

255
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:13,784
it can fuck with you.

256
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:13,941
Well,

257
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:14,774
Dr Drew,

258
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,021
you know,

259
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:15,680
not to bring it up.

260
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,530
I love Dr. Jones.

261
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,230
No.

262
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,063
Okay.

263
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:20,060
Yeah,

264
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,070
the Rehab I've,

265
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,180
I've watched a few times just to go,

266
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:24,014
whoa.

267
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,201
Well,

268
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:25,130
like they had a guy on there,

269
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:27,080
I'm not going to say whatever movie star.

270
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,240
He was like his vaporizing
pot and then like,

271
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,010
oh yeah.

272
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:30,843
You know what I'm talking about?

273
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,550
Say his name.

274
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:31,851
Eric.

275
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:32,160
Robert.

276
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,361
Okay.

277
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:32,931
Eric Roberts.

278
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:34,370
So I dunno if he's done
the podcast or not,

279
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:34,910
but no,

280
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,100
I would love to have on
the podcast by the code,

281
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:37,380
you know,

282
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,070
whatever.

283
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,600
Pick up my fuck dumb.

284
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,600
Here's the most,

285
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,170
uh,

286
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,930
he's the most celebrity
to be rehabbed in my mind.

287
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:45,171
I'm like,

288
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:45,331
yeah,

289
00:06:45,331 --> 00:06:46,430
that's an amazing actor.

290
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:46,970
I like,

291
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,200
if that's all he's doing,

292
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,311
so be it.

293
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:49,971
It's La,

294
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:50,960
he's an actor.

295
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,550
Getting high is like,

296
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:52,771
you know,

297
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:53,630
it wasn't a part of the,

298
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,580
I think that was just
the shit career move.

299
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,320
It was just a terrible career move.

300
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:57,651
I mean,

301
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:57,921
come on.

302
00:06:57,921 --> 00:06:59,750
He's saying that he's
got an addiction to pod.

303
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:01,490
That's so just stop smoking pot.

304
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:01,791
Yeah.

305
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,010
Everybody's shaking
their all shitting blood.

306
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,470
It's like reading the papers
and drinking a cup of coffee.

307
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:07,730
It was like nothing was wrong with,

308
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:09,230
this is one guy that
doesn't have a problem.

309
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,980
It's like they showed him vaporizing in
this beautiful bathroom in this house.

310
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,340
That's not the sign of a drug addict.

311
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,270
That's how you should be like an a shack.

312
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,523
The trailer park.

313
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,480
It's just silly.

314
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,613
Yes.

315
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:53,941
Freaks and Geeks.

316
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:54,691
Lovers and children.

317
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:55,230
What's going on.
