1
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,970
I started thinking about it
when people have said like,

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:06,331
you know,

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:06,681
you pick,

4
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:07,490
could you beat,

5
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:07,920
uh,

6
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,820
like 12,

7
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,743
12 year olds?

8
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:10,860
I fuck up 12,

9
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:11,340
12 year olds.

10
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,173
Okay,

11
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,570
sure.

12
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,770
Maybe a hundred percent.

13
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:14,670
What if they're organized?

14
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,000
I don't know.

15
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,833
They don't have a chance.

16
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,000
They don't have a chance if
they all come at you at once.

17
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:18,550
Nope.

18
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,040
And they don't care about getting beat up.

19
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,000
First of all,

20
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,320
everybody cares about getting beat up.

21
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:23,820
You're talking about non humans now.

22
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:24,751
Well wait,

23
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:26,190
what if you start training
them at a young age?

24
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,053
I'm going to fuck him up.

25
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,263
I don't have a chance.

26
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,460
The first one's going to get kicked into
a person who's going to get kicked hard

27
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:36,510
for sure in a panic and then I'm
just going to start smashing,

28
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,310
so,

29
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,880
okay.

30
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,400
Okay.

31
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,320
I listen.

32
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:41,220
If I had a fight,

33
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,410
me and 10 other dudes in a fight,

34
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:44,400
a 500 pound man,

35
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:45,240
that's more coyotes.

36
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,670
Shit.

37
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,831
I know.

38
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:46,690
It's a weird looking ones.

39
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,580
It's all very,

40
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:47,851
yeah,

41
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:48,481
he buries,

42
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,320
need a lot of berries.

43
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,220
Yeah.

44
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,053
Um,

45
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,990
if I had to,

46
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:52,824
uh,

47
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,280
get 10 friends and we had a fight,

48
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,830
a 500 pound hulking man,

49
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,600
we'd be fucked to be fucked.

50
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,440
We'd be fucked.

51
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,711
We didn't,

52
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:02,544
wouldn't have a chance.

53
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,151
What about 12?

54
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:04,110
Like Duncan trussell's.

55
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,570
Could you take that a little bit bigger
now it's current form performance.

56
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,250
Absolutely.

57
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,083
All up.

58
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:10,923
Wouldn't have a chance.

59
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,260
They are grown by the beard.

60
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,150
One of them in front of me at some point.

61
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,330
The problem with Dunkin as you wouldn't
be able to really do any damage if he

62
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:19,164
got close,

63
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,090
he could punch a square in the jaw and
you'd laugh it off like vehicle Rocco's.

64
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,041
Yeah.

65
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:23,874
You'd be like,

66
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:24,803
okay,

67
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,320
but if you got to deal with
like three Burt crushers,

68
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,071
right,

69
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:30,480
I'm probably going to get fucked up.

70
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,570
Even if he's not a trained fighter.

71
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,320
The first guy you have to take out
immediately hard as hard as you can.

72
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,650
You also have to show
consequences for everybody else.

73
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,920
We smoke way too much pot for this pod.

74
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,060
I believe it was the right amount.
