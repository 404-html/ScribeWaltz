1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,500
The joe rogan experience.
A Gal that I was dating once said to me,

2
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:07,020
never trust a girl,
doesn't have any girlfriends.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,060
And I said,
why do you say that?

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,650
And she goes,
because,

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,980
okay,
every girl knows that guys want to fuck

6
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:14,600
them,
right?

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,181
Yeah.
And I go,

8
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,460
yeah.
And I go and the girls don't want to

9
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:18,360
fuck yet.
Right?

10
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,260
And she goes,
yeah.

11
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,011
She goes,
well,

12
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:24,660
how come they don't like you
girls don't like that girl.

13
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,170
She doesn't have any girlfriends.
So it's one or two things have happened.

14
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,910
Either you just moved into town or you
fucked everybody's boyfriend.

15
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,520
Shit.
And I just looked at,

16
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:36,830
I'm like,
this bitch is too smart.

17
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:46,430
I'm an 18 at least 18% more chimpanzee
though,

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,170
Dude,
I've gotta get Outta here.

19
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,380
Fuck you.
I'm a kiss on the cheek.

20
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,580
And then the other cig Ma don't hit me.
I got to go.

21
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,290
That should be a short series,
Joe Rogan's defining moments

22
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,430
a moment like that.
That was a good one,

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,800
man.
Some serious knowledge on me.

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,010
She dropped some serious knowledge on
me.

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,770
She looked me in the eyes when she said
it too.

26
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:14,050
It's like a really strong move.
She goes,

27
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:16,210
don't ever trust a girl who doesn't have
any girlfriends.

28
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,350
And I remember seeing him,
cause I,

29
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:23,980
I remember saying to our goal,
I was like cocky because I was 24 when

30
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:25,270
she said this.
And I was like,

31
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:26,280
why?
What the fuck you buy?

32
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:27,101
Well,
who is say,

33
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:27,934
you know,
what about,

34
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,230
you know,
some girls are assholes.

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,150
And,
and then I just,

36
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,260
you know,
when she,

37
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,850
after she said that,
she's like,

38
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,260
the girls know who you are.
They know who you are.

39
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:39,820
And I just went,
wow,

40
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,200
that can't even argue with you.

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,640
Um,
the only equivalent I have to that,

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,110
and I hate to use his name twice and one
podcast,

43
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,920
Anthony Bordain,
Patrice,

44
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,640
I fucking wish I anymore beautiful trees
said to me one night,

45
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,710
I was talking to his black dude,
and we're sitting in the back of the

46
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:00,750
envelope,
the Boston comedy club.

47
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:02,550
We're sitting down,
there's a bench in the corner by the

48
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:04,230
window and we're sitting,
talking,

49
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:05,820
we're sitting talking,
and he's watching me the whole time.

50
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:08,640
And I'd just recently tried to grow a
beard for the first time.

51
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,200
And,
uh,

52
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,120
we get up,
the guy gets up and he moves and patrice

53
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:15,540
sits down next to me was the fuck you
doing talking to him.

54
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,450
I said,
what?

55
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,910
He goes,
don't ever talk to a black man that

56
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:22,140
doesn't have facial hair.
What's this have to do with it?

57
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:23,040
And he goes,
man,

58
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,420
he's trying to fuck you.
Any black man

59
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,600
has facial hair,
facial hair,

60
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,540
fucking great.
And then I started looking around at

61
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:38,541
every black dude I knew how facial hair.
It was like the greatest little fucking

62
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,930
patrice didn't even believe that.
He was only saying that because it was

63
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:42,764
the funny thing.

64
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,160
It was a bug with me.
And at the same time he goes,

65
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,990
you got to learn how to trim your lip.
Yup.

66
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,790
Cause I,
I was white guys.

67
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,160
We'll let the hair grow into their lip
and black guys don't do that.

68
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:53,640
Dates up on the lip.
But uh,

69
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,910
yeah,
these people,

70
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,000
one of the weird things about
psychedelics is people always,

71
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,070
even if it was one,
the most profound

72
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,860
experiences ever,
and one most amazing experiences ever,

73
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,780
people would tell you.
Yeah.

74
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:07,600
But it was just your mind playing tricks
on you.

75
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,240
Like it doesn't matter and you can go.
Okay.

76
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:14,470
But it's whether it was,
whether I really did travel to another

77
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:18,520
dimension and communicate with infinite
beings that were made out of love and

78
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:23,140
understanding who told me the secret to
life is positive energy and positive.

79
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,010
Even if it was just my imagination,
I still experienced it.

80
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,280
I experienced it as if it was real.
So whether it was real or whether it

81
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:32,620
wasn't real,
I get the exact same result.

82
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,010
Something happened that was unbelievably
incredible.

83
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:38,950
It took me to someplace that was
infinitely beautiful and then something

84
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:41,260
happened to me.
Like either that happened or it didn't

85
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:42,580
happen.
Well definitely happened.

86
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,940
It doesn't matter if it was imaginary.
It doesn't matter if it was only inside

87
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:46,720
my head.

88
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,940
The whole world comes out of the inside
of your head.

89
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,060
When we were kids,
I remember when I was a kid,

90
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,260
they would say like,
ah,

91
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,850
he's got such an imagination.
That's one.

92
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,440
It was talking about kids who were
liars,

93
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,600
you know?
That's how people treated the

94
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:00,490
imagination and the kids were just
fevers.

95
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,950
You know,
because that's imagination to some

96
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,671
people.
You know,

97
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:07,060
some people they didn't think it was
something to be encouraged,

98
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,370
but it's really where everything comes
from.

99
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,970
And that's the weirdest thing about it
is the imagination conjures up an idea

100
00:04:13,971 --> 00:04:17,470
in which becomes a laptop.
It conjures up an idea which becomes an

101
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:19,960
airplane.
It all comes from the imagination,

102
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,540
whether it's artistic or whether it's a
song,

103
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,050
whether it's a joke.
That's the weirdest thing ever.

104
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,450
And everybody wants to pretend that it's
so normal.

105
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,950
And so normally just thinking shit up
out of the middle of fucking nowhere and

106
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:34,240
creating nuclear power.

107
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,211
You know,
what did you do it?

108
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:37,460
You sat down and what?
You wrote some stuff on some,

109
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,210
a pad and then you figured it out.
Where's this all coming from?

110
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,460
Where's the idea to even do that coming
from?

111
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,910
Where's the idea that some,
some guy wants to be like a fucking bird

112
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,710
and put wings on and figure out how to
fly.

113
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:50,620
And he eventually figured it out and now
we just travel all over the world and we

114
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:52,480
don't think anything of it.
I mean,

115
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:56,320
the imagination is crazy.
The imagination has done some amazing

116
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:59,980
things for human beings in this world.
And yet we still don't give her the

117
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:01,540
credit it deserves.
It's,

118
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,010
uh,
it was kind of shocking.

119
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,900
You know,
imagination is like the most underrated

120
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:08,710
thing of all time,
and yet it's the foundation of our

121
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:13,120
advancement in evolution.
Are you hopeful about things when you

122
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:15,670
see like Arab spring,
people were rising up and trying to

123
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:17,860
remove dictators and what happened in
Egypt?

124
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,870
Getting rid of Mubarak?

125
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,330
I am hopeful and I think it's,
I think it is happening all over the

126
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:25,990
world and I think the Internet has
played a part with it and it's happening

127
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:27,580
in America.
Um,

128
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,431
you know,
I,

129
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:30,610
I come here as a,
as a foreigner,

130
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:31,780
I'm British.
I come to,

131
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:34,300
I come to America often.
Um,

132
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,830
I have family here in America.
I feel very closely connected with

133
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:40,810
America.
And America is a paradox.

134
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,730
You know,
it's a huge paradox because on the

135
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:44,640
world's stage,
uh,

136
00:05:44,641 --> 00:05:47,860
America is a very dark and malignant
force,

137
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,060
which,
uh,

138
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,890
which does tremendous harm,
uh,

139
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,700
consistently and has done for a long
time.

140
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,360
But at the individual level,
there's a tremendous spirit of awakening

141
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:00,500
in America.
Look,

142
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:03,740
just what's happening with cannabis laws
in America in the last,

143
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,220
the last 10 years,
that's unimaginable in Britain.

144
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,690
We can't make changes like that because
we don't have this spirit of

145
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:12,230
independence.

146
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,580
We don't have the structure where
individual states can make decisions on

147
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:18,260
key issues like that.
And,

148
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,620
and of course in America there's a
conflict between state law and federal

149
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:22,610
law.
You know,

150
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:26,450
the federal government is not always
respecting state laws and is seeking to

151
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:28,340
persecute people who are,
who are using cannabis.

152
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:30,620
But you know,
I think that that in itself,

153
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:34,130
the fact that a number of states have
decriminalized or even legalized

154
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:35,260
cannabis,
uh,

155
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,950
is a sign of a,
a sea change that is underway at the

156
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:42,680
moment.
And what it reflects is an awakening of

157
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:44,510
the American people.
So even though,

158
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,010
you know,
huge negative forces are still at work,

159
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,680
and I still sitting in the seat of
power,

160
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,960
I think,
I think there's a tremendous hope for

161
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:55,710
the future in America.
And that comes from the,

162
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,870
the awakening to consciousness of the
American people.

163
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,220
And maybe it's small right now,
but it's growing and in that sense,

164
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,480
far more than any other,
I believe America is leading the world.

165
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,030
That there is this,
that this possibility for awakening

166
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,560
here.
And maybe it goes back to the,

167
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,050
you know,
to the founding fathers on the frontier

168
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:15,881
days and just the,
the,

169
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:16,281
the,
the,

170
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:19,760
the sense that that people should be
able to make decisions about their own

171
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:21,650
lives without government telling them
what to do.

172
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:24,290
That's the step we all need to take.
We need to move ahead.

173
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:29,291
We need to set aside our commitment to
these large monolithic religions.

174
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:32,360
We need to set aside our commitment to
large,

175
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:35,660
monolithic states.
We need to run our own lives and make

176
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:39,320
decisions for ourselves.
And it just happens that that is very

177
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:41,660
close to the heart of what America is
all about.

178
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:47,110
[inaudible]

179
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,380
freaks and geeks level.
