1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,460
Hey everybody,

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:10,810
I snuck up on you bitches barely let you
know that we were doing a podcast today

3
00:00:11,421 --> 00:00:11,691
at all.

4
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:16,490
So there's a lot of people on Ustream
that are like the really hardcore freaks.

5
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:17,690
They're sitting in front of the camera,

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,930
the computer waiting for Shit to start
and those are the ones that are paying

7
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:21,764
attention right now.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,530
We did.
I didn't even smoke weed dude.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,240
Be careful. The government is
listening. This is federally illegal.

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,990
Um, the Joe Rogan experience podcast
is brought to you by several things.

11
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,570
One of them is, does
that me? Yeah, that's me.

12
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:40,571
Of course I'm to retard is a Ting Tang
is a cell phone company that we've been

13
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,403
working with.

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,500
That is a really interesting experiment
in the way a cell phone company conducts

15
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:52,520
business and one of the things they're
doing is they have no contracts. Okay.

16
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:54,680
Complete, no contracts, excellent phones.

17
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,450
They sent me the Samsung Galaxy
s three and it is the shit.

18
00:00:59,451 --> 00:01:03,980
I am using it right now. It's an amazing
phone. It's on the sprint network,

19
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,910
which is a, it's great for service.
Joey Diaz raves about splint sprint.

20
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:10,490
He's had sprint for awhile
and I've been using it now.

21
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,930
I really enjoy the big screen on this
fucking phone and it's hard to go back to

22
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:17,270
an iPhone.
Even this little iPhone five,

23
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,550
you silly little bitch
with your extra half inch.

24
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:20,830
Dario,

25
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,850
I might go to Tim because I got so pissed
off at apple and they fucked my iPhone

26
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:28,230
five order up and I might just fucking
say fuck it and get one of these s three

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,450
dude, we'll hook you up. You
need to get one of these.

28
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:35,040
The galaxy s three is for looking at
photos and looking at the web and looking

29
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:38,310
at like videos and movies. You can't
beat it, man. It's, it's incredible.

30
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,020
When people send you pictures,
it's like,

31
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,150
it's almost like looking
at a picture on a laptop.

32
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:46,440
It's just so vibrant and big and the
screen's amazing and the operating system

33
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:50,340
is so, it can do so many
fucking cool things go online.

34
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:54,390
And I don't want to just sell the Samsung
Galaxy s three because Tim has a lot

35
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:57,660
of really cool, uh, different, uh,
phones that you can buy. There's,

36
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,560
there's a plethora of devices
that you could pick up from them.

37
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,770
And if you go to
rogan.ting.com you sign up,

38
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,910
uh,
or rather a login through that URL,

39
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,010
you get $50 off of any smartphone
that you, you choose to buy.

40
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,510
And they have this Samsung Galaxy s two,
the Samsung Galaxy s three,

41
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,260
looking at your website. It has a
little girl holding your face. Look,

42
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:26,180
if you've got a Rogan Diet,
look behind you.

43
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,080
It's a cool a little girl holding my face.
It's trawling.

44
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:31,430
There's a little little girl just like,
Hey,

45
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:34,190
I'm wondering the Joe Rogan
experience that welcomes the Joe

46
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,750
and listeners. Oh, that's so cute.

47
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,370
And he saved 50 bucks and a here's another
good thing like say if you and your

48
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:45,080
wife and maybe even how to have a daughter
and our son and they, uh, you know,

49
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,830
you don't use enough minutes to,

50
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,950
to warrant having three
different phone bills. Well,

51
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:55,520
with teaching you can all share minutes.
So with,

52
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,970
with three different devices,
you can all be on one plan.

53
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,400
If you don't use all of your minutes,
they carry over to the next month.

54
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,960
And if you use more minutes,
it's just scaled your, your,

55
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:09,910
your bill is a,
is scaled.

56
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,030
So it's a really fair way of doing
business. It's all explained at,

57
00:03:15,031 --> 00:03:18,730
at Tang. And if you go to
rogan.ting.com you could check it out.

58
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:19,960
But you know what,
look man,

59
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,540
the contracts and all the stuff
that you have to deal with,

60
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,960
if you go through the bigger cell phone
companies, they're kind of fucked.

61
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,930
It's kind of shitty and it
kinda sucks for the consumer.

62
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:33,580
And Ting is correcting that and they're
correcting it with excellent signal,

63
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:38,680
excellent service, really good phones,
really good customer service man.

64
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:41,590
They've trained some cool
people and they've, uh, they've,

65
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,130
they've set an environment at
Ting and that environment is,

66
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,210
we're trying to be fair.

67
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:48,730
We're trying to provide you with a
really good service and do it at a really

68
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:51,880
good rate. And a, I love it.
I love the idea behind it.

69
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:55,390
I love what they're trying to do and uh,
I'm, I'm happy to be working with them.

70
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:58,820
If you've got a rogan.ting.com
you can see all of the, uh,

71
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,520
the devices that they have, uh, all
the different smart phones and, uh,

72
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,530
the different plans that they have and
uh, no contracts. So go check it out.

73
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,460
And a thank you to Tim and thank you also
to onnit.com we're always sponsored by

74
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:16,270
on it makers of Alpha brain.
I've had no Alpha brain and no pot before.

75
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,520
I'm fucking sober. Shit, bitches. I'm
confusing. Maybe not right now. Maybe,

76
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,690
maybe in a few.
Uh,

77
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,630
we have to get through this as quickly
as possible because we're doing a live

78
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,300
phone call with, uh, with Shane
Smith from vice any second now. Uh,

79
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,080
so before I do that,

80
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:35,770
please go to [inaudible] dot com and
check out all of the different supplements

81
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:40,540
of our sponsor on it is not
just a sponsor, the podcast.
I own a piece of on it.

82
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,520
And the reason why I do
is because first of all,

83
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:47,110
I believe very much in supplementation
and vitamins and minerals and,

84
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,090
and keeping your body healthy and,

85
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:53,500
and providing it with nutrients that
can enhance the way your body performs.

86
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,970
And these are subtle enhancements.

87
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:58,240
It's not like if you're a fat fuck we'd
cheeseburgers and smoked cigarettes,

88
00:04:58,241 --> 00:05:01,750
you're instantly going to feel better
from Alpha brain. But what it is, is it's,

89
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,680
it's giving, no offense,
it's giving you a, a wind.

90
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:09,970
I wasn't thinking about Brian and all
I said that sounded that way. I wasn't,

91
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:12,620
I wasn't, I just, why I corrected
it and said, no offense, um,

92
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,920
health is very important to me.
You know,

93
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,880
I'm one of those people that believes
that your body and your mind are all one

94
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:23,240
unit and they don't work better there.
They don't work well rather, uh,

95
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,480
in less.
All of it is healthy.

96
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,850
And I think nutrients are a
very important part of that.

97
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:30,310
It's very important to eat healthy foods.

98
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,700
It's very important to get a lot of
vegetables in your diet, clean meats,

99
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:37,210
grass fed meat if you
can, you know, wild fish.

100
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,850
It's very important to take
fish oil and supplements,

101
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:45,070
but I also think that you can get more,
more performance out of your mind,

102
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,890
more performance out of your body
by taking certain supplements.

103
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:52,380
And all of those supplements are
available@auditona.com that's Oh and nit

104
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,910
including shroom tech, which
is a, uh, there's two stream
tech sport, which is uh,

105
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:01,880
uh, based on the quadriceps mushroom
and it enhances your physical endurance.

106
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,690
I use some today before Jujitsu class,
I believe in.

107
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:08,360
I take it before every
workout. Um, all of it,

108
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,930
all the controversial information about
all these different supplements is all

109
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:16,340
explained with the science behind all of
it at [inaudible] dot com and on it we

110
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:18,740

145
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,200
What's going on over there buddy?
Okay,

146
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,360
I'm covered in a Mazola
oil and no underwear.

147
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,670
Are you, you, you, you're very low energy.

148
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:15,240
Are you tired from all of this craziness
from exposing this craziness to the

149
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:16,230
world?
Is that what's going on?

150
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,140
I'm high or Dean, whenever
I'm talking to you, I'm I or,

151
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,700
well, I'm hiring a gene
whenever I talk to you too.

152
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,880
So tell me what the fuck is going on.
You are,

153
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:31,910
you are premiering the Mexican Mormon
war series on vice and the vice youtube

154
00:08:32,431 --> 00:08:34,350
channel. Correct. Tell us all about this.

155
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,900
Well, we went down to, um,

156
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,990
to Allah in northern Mexico to do a story
on Mormons who are fighting the drug

157
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:44,900
cartels.

158
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,900
The first people we met were the Lebaron
from the Lebaron colony and now they,

159
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,520
the Romneys, the live
bands, the Jones was there.

160
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:58,521
I went down from Utah when the
American government outlawed polygamy.

161
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,350
And they believe that, uh, because
Joseph Smith said that, uh,

162
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,170
you have to get to the highest level
of celestial heaven by being part of a

163
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:11,070
plural marriage. They said, well, fuck
it. I'm not going to stay in America,

164
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:13,390
not go to heaven. So they went
down to Mexico. That's a good,

165
00:09:13,391 --> 00:09:14,370
it could be polygamous.

166
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,370
That's it. I, Jan is a
beautiful wrap by the way.

167
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,460
Got Mad props that Joseph
Smith for keeping his

168
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,690
giant hair. I'm strong.
I'm sorry, go ahead.

169
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,500
Exactly. And I think, you know,

170
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,890
Brigham Young had had had a hell
of a lot of whys. I forget the,

171
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:35,940
I think it was 23 but it don't quote me
on that. But anyway, so they believed,

172
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:39,630
you know, to keep going to heaven
that they had to have many partners.

173
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,540
So anyway,
they went down there,

174
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:47,520
they form these Mormon colonies and
the colonies did quite well. I mean,

175
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:50,670
they're, they're, they're successful
farms. They have, you know,

176
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,360
nice little towns and, you know,
they're, they're, they're, they're,

177
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:58,300
they're sort of affluent and deals.
They're big tall guys and cowboy hats.

178
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,490
They looked like a bunch of
Texans down there. So anyway,

179
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,260
we heard that some of the Mormons down
there had been fighting the cartels

180
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:12,261
because the cartels started kidnapping
the Mormons and extorting them for money.

181
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:17,060
So this one plan, the
Lebaron plan had, had, had,

182
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,190
had gone to war with this guy
and then elevate key news.

183
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,660
Like it was one of the
biggest bad ass, um, uh,

184
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,500
narcos.

185
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,240
He actually massacre 18 people in a
drug rehab center just cause they were

186
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:31,270
trying to get off of trucks.

187
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:36,300
She's a very bad man and he lived eight
miles down the road from the Lebaron

188
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:41,300
colony. So they started
going to war. Um, they,

189
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,070
they, they forced him to release, uh,

190
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,720
they're a 16 year old
cousin who because of that,

191
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:53,320
he got pissed off and he killed,
um, you know, two of them. Uh,

192
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,280
in retaliation and then it all went crazy.

193
00:10:56,281 --> 00:11:00,270
So as we were down there hanging out
with them and seeing what they had done

194
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:05,010
using antiquaries techniques
from Afghanistan and, and, uh,

195
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,990
and Iraq have checkpoints and
snipers posts and all this stuff.

196
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,540
And I were going crazy there.

197
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,433
What's going on?

198
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,870
Got Our connection,
got wind of it where,

199
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,940
Oh, I didn't, it sounds fine
over here. And we heard you
loud and clear. Okay, great.

200
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,460
So ignore that noise. Yeah, I
don't, I don't hear it over here.

201
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:32,450
So, so they started making these
military checkpoints. They had snipers,

202
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,930
a lookout points and, and, uh, you know,

203
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:40,130
military checkpoints and all of a sudden
the violence died down and their region

204
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,850
excepted continued in, in,
in the rest of the areas.

205
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,160
And so as we were hanging out
with the, the, uh, the, the,

206
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:51,410
the little barons who told
us some crazy stories,

207
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:56,240
the reason why the Lebaron
we're ready for the, the, this,

208
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,390
the sort of narco cartels,
uh,

209
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:03,391
aggression was because they were already
armed and ready to fight because they

210
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:08,320
had had a civil war within their sort
of fundamentalist break off church.

211
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,050
Um,
where this guy named oval,

212
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,120
a baron who tried to take over the church
and he's also dubbed the Mormon Manson.

213
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,331
He killed,
well,

214
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:21,220
he says he suspected and about 40
murder cases in America and in,

215
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:25,630
in Mexico. And then they caught him
and he tried to actually, he was,

216
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,140
he threatened to commit Jimmy to
kill Jimmy Carter at one point.

217
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:34,830
And then they caught him in 25 people
were killed after they caught him because

218
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:38,350
he left his blood atonement
last will and testament.

219
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,630
So they kept killing his family.
He had a 20 to 30 children,

220
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:47,800
I believe from 10 wives and they
were, they became as hip. It's acid,

221
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,390
they would kill people for him.

222
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,650
So they were ready because of this sort
of civil war within their own family,

223
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:56,830
within their own church. They were
ready to fight. And because of that,

224
00:12:56,831 --> 00:13:01,300
when the Narcos came after them, uh, you
know, they were armed and ready to go.

225
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:02,170
And they famously,

226
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:06,360
the Lebaron outshot the Mexican military
in a shootout when they came to,

227
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,440
to try to get the guns off them.

228
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,690
So anyways, when we were, when we
were hanging out with the Lebaron,

229
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:16,940
um, they were saying, oh yeah, you know,
you should go hang out with the Romney's.

230
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,630
They live just across the valley. And
when I called on the Romney's like, yeah,

231
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,590
mid, I'm like, what? And
they're like, yeah. Uh,

232
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:29,570
George Romney,
Mitt's father was born in a Mormon colony.

233
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,463
Um,

234
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:35,650
originally it polygamous Mormon colony
and colonial the blind and, you know,

235
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,340
went to America. You know, it's, it's,
it's been reported that actually,

236
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:40,970
uh,

237
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,650
George Romney went to America illegally
as an illegal immigrant or they crossed

238
00:13:45,651 --> 00:13:50,120
the border illegally anyway.
And, uh, but they're still there.

239
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,120
The Romneys are still
there and in our law,

240
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:58,070
and they have a comme une now there
LDS or not the latter day saints there,

241
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,040
there are sort of orthodox Mormons
are not polygamist anymore. Um,

242
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,890
what's the benefit of staying in,
in Mexico?

243
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:12,030
I don't know. I mean, that's their own,
you know, they, they, they, you know,

244
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:15,780
they live there and, uh, they have
their community there and you know,

245
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:17,700
that's what they do.
They've been kidnapped as well.

246
00:14:17,701 --> 00:14:21,840
They had a kidnap things within
their own family. And uh,

247
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,220
um,

248
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,160
but you know that they've been there
for a while and they're like, well,

249
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:30,720
you know, we're not leaving.
You know, they have to leave.

250
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,980
So what's interesting about it
though is the Romneys are like,

251
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,660
they're really nice guys and they're like,
look,

252
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:42,410
Mitt Romney should contact us because his
policy on immigration is wrong because

253
00:14:42,571 --> 00:14:47,130
policy on, on, on drugs is
wrong. They're like, look at,
unless you decriminalize it,

254
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,650
it's much like prohibition.
You know,

255
00:14:49,651 --> 00:14:53,770
Al Capone and Lucky Luciano became big
because everyone's still Jack as much

256
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:57,170
during prohibition. They just, the mob
Brian, it's the same thing with drugs.

257
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,300
So you know,
it's,

258
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,280
it's interesting to talk to them because
they live on the front war, sorry,

259
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,450
front line of this drug war and they
see what's happening with illegal

260
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,940
immigration and these are sort of big,
you know,

261
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,440
tough Texas died dudes
who, who are, you know,

262
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,980
pro Romney and go republican and all that
stuff and they're like, look, you know,

263
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:22,370
he's wrong and he should talk to us
because the drug policy is wrong.

264
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:23,640
And the immigration policy as well.

265
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,230
So it was really interesting to hang out
with them because they're actually at

266
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:31,180
war, you know, every day.
And you know, it's, it's,

267
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,580
it's literally not even
one generation removed.

268
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,580
And this,
the whole story is crazy.

269
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:40,680
It's crazy what they have to go
to down then after, you know,

270
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,920
how they're fighting the narco is because
the NAACOS control the whole area and

271
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:50,220
these pockets of Mormon
resistance or uh, you know, are,

272
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,750
are the only ones fighting the,
the cartels.

273
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:57,860
It is crazy because it's one
generation removed from Mitt Romney.

274
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,860
Guy was running for president and there
essentially living like a mad max movie.

275
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:07,800
Correct. That's, that's, that's the whole
thing. It's wild is everyone, you know,

276
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:12,550
making a big deal about Obama's, you know,
a history and, and, and, and everything.

277
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:15,130
And you're like, hold on a
second. Myth and history is crazy.

278
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,130
They went down as polygamous
colonies and the fighting,

279
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,380
there's kidnappings and cocaine and drug
cartels and whore and, and he, you know,

280
00:16:23,381 --> 00:16:26,990
he's just ignoring it. And so when
we went down there, you know, we,

281
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,740
we just thought, wow, what a
story. And the story is crazy.

282
00:16:29,741 --> 00:16:33,280
It probably wants up today when we
were doing seven plots and it just gets

283
00:16:33,281 --> 00:16:37,900
crazier and crazier as we go. But
like, you know, internal, you know, uh,

284
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:42,960
civil wars and murders and cartels
and killings and it's just crazy.

285
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,980
And it's like, you know, right.

286
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,660
Just out to the American border and these
guys had been living down there sort

287
00:16:49,661 --> 00:16:53,380
of in their own little world and now
it's, it's, you know, it's just coming.

288
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,340
It's just coming to the fore

289
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:55,630
crazy

290
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:00,250
story. And, and the fact that, you know,
Mitt Romney is literally, you know,

291
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,000
his dad, his dad had
had to leave there. He,

292
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:08,320
his dad came up from a Mormon
colony in, in Mexico. So it's crazy.

293
00:17:08,321 --> 00:17:10,780
I know by the way, his dad
ran, ran for president,

294
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:16,060
but his campaign didn't last very long
because they called into question his

295
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,620
citizenship as well as, uh,
his colonies polygamous past.

296
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:25,210
So I think, you know, once burned,
twice shy, I mean it is very, um,

297
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,610
you know, he doesn't want
to get into this obviously,

298
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:31,120
and he for sure doesn't want to get into
what's happening with the rest of the

299
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:33,280
ones down there because it's a,
it's crazy.

300
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,580
Yes. I don't think most people are
aware of this whole Mormon colony.

301
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:40,070
They're certainly not aware of that.
Mitt Romney's a part of it.

302
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,280
How is this being, this sounds like crazy
information. Like it's, it's really,

303
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,220
it has dark implications
that this is being ignored

304
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,250
when you look at the media.
I mean it's,

305
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,940
it's really damning if this is like
readily available information. Yeah.

306
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,790
Is Sort of Mormon,
which I mean,

307
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:09,490
obviously he's not sort of going forward
with it saying, yes, you know, I'm a,

308
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,333
I mean,

309
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,480
this is what the Mormon church is and
this is what it should be doing and this

310
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:18,860
is what I'm doing and all that stuff,
you know. But he's also definitely not,

311
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:24,170
um, you know, he just
started to sort of say,

312
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:28,760
you know, my, my dad was from Mexico to
try to sort of get the, the Latino vote.

313
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,100
What's interesting is,
you know,

314
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,810
it was dad who came from Mexico
and then did really well here,

315
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:40,040
you know, is the poster child of his Mitt
Romney for the dream act for, you know,

316
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:44,330
if you come here and you work
hard and make a living, um, then,

317
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,480
then you can get amnesty and,
and you know,

318
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,640
his dad who was the poster child for it
and he actually said he would veto the

319
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:57,370
dream act. So he's actually, you know,
being incredibly sort of, you know,

320
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,330
even more right wing than the they already
republican sort of right wing party

321
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,400
and, and uh, you know,

322
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:08,420
there's a lot of supposition that the
reason why is it's kind of like me thinks

323
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:13,250
di does protest too much because he
doesn't want to get sort of dragged into

324
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:18,170
this sort of whole history because it
cannot do him any good because drug wars

325
00:19:18,171 --> 00:19:22,730
and immigration and, uh,
you know, kidnapping and,

326
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,380
and people getting their heads
chopped off it, you know, and,

327
00:19:26,381 --> 00:19:31,010
and history of polygamy does not a good
presidential candidate make. And I'm,

328
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,360
I'm sure that, you know, they're
worried about the other and you know,

329
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,910
obviously Mormonism has history and,

330
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:42,380
and still some current problems with
polygamy and they for sure want to stay

331
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:46,370
away from that. But also they
want to stay away from stories.

332
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:49,700
More importantly,
like the failure of the war on drugs,

333
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,320
which has been a complete
and utter failure. Um,

334
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,380
there's never been more drugs in America
for cheaper or better quality yet

335
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,960
people are dying because
we let the mob run it. Um,

336
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:05,720
and it's just totally doesn't work yet.
He insists on maintaining those,

337
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:09,980
those standard operating procedures,
sort of policies that just don't work.

338
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,150
And by the way his mom and brother and
but also his own flesh and blood is

339
00:20:14,151 --> 00:20:14,990
paying the price for it.

340
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:19,610
Well a guy like the scariest to
me about written Mitt Romney,

341
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,680
Mitt Romney seems like a robot.

342
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,270
He doesn't seem like a real person when
he interacts with people and that kind

343
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:30,380
of like disconnected behavior,
the way he interacts with people.

344
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:35,360
So weird and disconnected.
That's indicative of a lot
of people who are really,

345
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:40,361
really religious and I have a friend
who went through most of her life being

346
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:45,170
very religious and has recently fallen
like over the last sort of decade,

347
00:20:45,171 --> 00:20:49,270
kind of fallen away from religion and
is now starting to question her life.

348
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,660
And one of the things that she said
was that when she was really religious,

349
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:57,040
she didn't question anything. She just
sort of went along with things. She just,

350
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:57,620
you,
you,

351
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,990
you become like indoctrinated into this
kind of thinking where there's always

352
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:04,300
someone smarter than you.
Always someone who tells me what to do.

353
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,850
You don't ever question it.
God has a plan for everything.

354
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:11,320
It's like the same sort of package that
it all went into in her head and I see a

355
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:12,430
guy like Mitt Romney,
I'm like,

356
00:21:12,431 --> 00:21:16,960
they can tell this guy to do anything and
he's going to do it. He's got no spine,

357
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,320
he's got no real opinions on things.
He he,

358
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:24,640
his opinions are based on what he thinks
will work numbers wise and when he's

359
00:21:24,641 --> 00:21:27,220
communicating with people,
he makes no connection with them.

360
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,000
When he has these conversations with
like regular folks who have questions for

361
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:32,950
him, it's one of the worst
things he could ever do.

362
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,490
They should have never let him do that
because every time he tries to be like a

363
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:40,900
man of the people and gay marriage comes
up or medical marijuana comes up or

364
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:45,490
anything, anything that requires
like real thinking, a real debate.

365
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:50,410
He's a fucking robot man.
He's a monk. A mechanical guy.

366
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,260
Yeah. I think he, look, he's the typical

367
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,580
whatever it'll take to get elected.
So He's,

368
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,960
he's trying to be all things to
all people, which just can't work.

369
00:22:02,961 --> 00:22:04,250
You have to be a human being.

370
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,100
Well, you understand this.
I'm sorry, go ahead, please.

371
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:10,570
Yeah. What I think I'd rather,
there's no one's perfect,

372
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:13,960
but what I'd rather somebody who says,
yeah, I come from this, you know,

373
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,940
crazy shit and Mexico and yes,

374
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:20,320
it's a problem and we have to do something
to fix that problem because all of

375
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:24,970
the money for the cocaine comes from
pod and every other drug comes from

376
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:26,860
America.
The guns come from America.

377
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,500
Everything like the market
for all the drugs in America,

378
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:32,650
but all the people being killed in Mexico.
And you know,

379
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,440
we've got to do something to help
that because you know, I'm from there.

380
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,520
If he would say something human, you know,
that's, it's just like, look, you know,

381
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:43,420
I don't want these people to be
killed. You know, there's more,

382
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,370
it's by a factor of 10.

383
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,020
So 10 times more Mexicans have
been killed or people, sorry,

384
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:52,990
people have been killed in the,
in the war on drugs.

385
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:57,290
And then in the real wars in American
killed American soldiers killed him in

386
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:59,930
Iraq and Afghanistan.
It's quite a factor of 10

387
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:07,190
but it's after 10 the point you're like,
look, this is a right on our board.

388
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,250
It's going to be a failed state soon and
it's all flowers and we just can't do

389
00:23:11,251 --> 00:23:12,420
anything to fix it.
And what,

390
00:23:12,421 --> 00:23:16,080
I'd much rather just have someone
be a human being and say, yeah,

391
00:23:16,081 --> 00:23:18,470
I came from that.
That's where I came from and now I'm here,

392
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,480
this is what I'm doing. But you know
what, like people are dying down there.

393
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:23,220
We've got to do something.
Or you know,

394
00:23:23,221 --> 00:23:26,580
we've got to sort of look at immigration
a little bit better than than,

395
00:23:26,581 --> 00:23:29,430
than we have been because obviously
that's not working either.

396
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:30,960
And instead of that,

397
00:23:30,961 --> 00:23:35,830
it's just the standard pat political
answers that don't mean anything.

398
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,840
And the no one's gonna do
anything. And, and, and,

399
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:42,550
and the same policies that haven't worked,
you know, in the past 20 or 30 years,

400
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:45,330
I mean, the won drudge is just
like, it's a fucking joke and

401
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,900
it's weekend when you go down,
it's weakening when you go down.

402
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,170
No,

403
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:54,000
where do you go down there you like
literally you cross over from El Paso,

404
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:57,860
Texas into our as Mexico. It's the
same city just divided by a border.

405
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,560
El Pastor is one of the safest cities in
America because it's a police state and

406
00:24:01,561 --> 00:24:04,710
the cartels live up there
and you pass into Juarez,

407
00:24:04,711 --> 00:24:09,360
which is w w it's the most dangerous
city in the world for journalists.

408
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:11,880
And it was one of the most
dangerous cities in the world,

409
00:24:11,881 --> 00:24:15,990
but I believe it's just been up to the
most dangerous city in the world, uh,

410
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:20,200
for murders. So you're sitting
there going, how is that
possible? You know, how,

411
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:25,250
how is that the most dangerous city in
the world is the same city as El Paso,

412
00:24:25,411 --> 00:24:28,680
Texas. So you know the whole
thing when you're down there,

413
00:24:28,681 --> 00:24:33,360
you realize that this,
we always say where all the adults are,

414
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,760
you know, this is the absurdity
of the modern condition.

415
00:24:35,761 --> 00:24:38,040
But when you're down there,
you're exactly right.

416
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:42,810
It's Mad Max five minutes out of the
American border and it's not like we can

417
00:24:42,811 --> 00:24:47,130
just say, oh, so it was crazy. Mexicans.
I mean all the guns are coming from us,

418
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,000
all the money is coming from us.
The market for the cocaine is here.

419
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,110
Like it's just, it's all
us. We're just saying,

420
00:24:52,111 --> 00:24:55,200
well you guys can shoot each other
down there and we don't care.

421
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,150
Well not only that,

422
00:24:56,151 --> 00:25:01,151
there's documented of our guys are
people selling guns to the Mexican drug

423
00:25:03,991 --> 00:25:08,620
cartels so they can, you know, quote
unquote trace them or something. So they,

424
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:13,260
they've sold them guns that have
actually wound up killing American border

425
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,220
agents that gets real mad

426
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,500
fasten period where
there's been a bunch of,

427
00:25:17,501 --> 00:25:19,330
the most famous is the fast and furious.

428
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,020
How does that happen?

429
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,890
Well, they gave, they were
giving, giving, not selling,

430
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:29,891
giving guns to the cartels and
thinking they could track them.

431
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,190
And the only, they found them, they
lost track of them all the same.

432
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,260
They came up in a, in,
in, yes, you're correct.

433
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:43,850
In the deaths of American agents
guns that we had given them. Uh,

434
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,630
we're, we're using those murders, which
has just, I found it to be shocking,

435
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,340
but also there was,

436
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:52,400
when I was down there actually
two things when I was down there,

437
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:57,260
the largest hall of ammunition, uh,
got caught the, at the Mexican border,

438
00:25:57,261 --> 00:25:59,270
which we went to. It's
all, all the ammunition,

439
00:25:59,271 --> 00:26:01,030
all the weapons coming from America.

440
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:05,460
It's shocking the amount of like they've
truckloads full of weapons grade, uh,

441
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:09,170
you know,
7.62 a ammunition.

442
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:13,170
But also one of the things
that, that, that you know,

443
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,580
is crazy about,
you know,

444
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:20,580
what's happening is the amount of
killings that go on with weapon. Oh yeah.

445
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:23,540
Sorry. The other thing was
there was, uh, an ex CIA,

446
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,950
I forget which one,
but the ex head of the CIA,

447
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:33,250
his ceremonial pistol is
ceremonials 45 that they,

448
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,730
they give you like,
you know,

449
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:39,731
as a ward and when you leave office was
found on a narco lord when he was done.

450
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:42,710
And so he had the head of CIA.

451
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,650
CIA is a 45 caliber.
Uh,

452
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,360
we're just sitting there and going like,
now it's in the level of absurdity.

453
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,490
Now it's in the level of,
you know,

454
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,730
fast and the furious and we'll give them
guns and then they kill us with her own

455
00:26:57,731 --> 00:26:58,450
guns.
And

456
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,410
it's a Cohen brothers can't at crazy

457
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,780
in any way where I would
think, oh, that's a good idea.

458
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,480
Give them guns and track them.

459
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,490
It's amazing that these fucking morons
are the ones who are in charge of these

460
00:27:16,491 --> 00:27:20,060
things. The people that could come up
with an idea like that, either some,

461
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,780
either they're lying and they're making
money and they're corrupt and this is

462
00:27:23,781 --> 00:27:27,680
just how they masked it or
they're criminally and competent.

463
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:31,360
Yeah. Well, what makes it worse is the,

464
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:35,730
the sort of the lead
cartel now that they test.

465
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,160
What happened with them is
they were actually trained,

466
00:27:39,161 --> 00:27:43,900
the core group of the Vegas were
trained by the DEA to be counter,

467
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:48,760
um, you know, counter cartel, you know,

468
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,230
super police.

469
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,090
And so they were trained by the DEA
and then they went down and then we're

470
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,550
working for a bit, and
then they said, screw this.

471
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:02,551
And they sold themselves as
mercenaries to the various hotels,

472
00:28:03,191 --> 00:28:08,040
famously the Gulf cartel. And
then they said, well, screw this,

473
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,460
we're just going to take over.

474
00:28:09,461 --> 00:28:12,220
And now they're sort of
hedge demonic you cocktail.

475
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,770
And they were all trained by the DEA.

476
00:28:14,771 --> 00:28:18,310
So they use the training that the DEA
gave them to take over from the other

477
00:28:18,311 --> 00:28:22,860
cartels, and now they're running shit. And
you're just like, holy fuck. I mean this,

478
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,580
you couldn't write a
Hollywood script this week.

479
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,730
Well,
that's very similar to the

480
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,260
who then became the Taliban,
right?

481
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,570
Isn't that the same thing
that happened in Afghanistan?

482
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:38,710
100% then and, and so now we're fighting
the people that we armed and trained.

483
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,160
And guess what? It's happening
now. We actually admit to it,

484
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,700
we are arming and training, um, uh,

485
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,910
Islamic fundamentalists in Somalia,
uh,

486
00:28:48,911 --> 00:28:51,840
in an effort to fight Al Shabaab there.
But this,

487
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:56,930
these people who were training to
fight Al Shabaab are avowed, um,

488
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,880
you know, anti western Islamic
fundamentalists. So we're doing it again.

489
00:29:00,881 --> 00:29:03,580
It's not like we were over, it's not
like we're learning from my mistake.

490
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,740
Whilst while this is going on, there's
all this crazy saber rattling about Iran,

491
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,880
you know,
I mean this really looks like,

492
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,730
it looks like the end of the world
is like knocking on our front door.

493
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:20,320
Well, I'm actually going,
my next trip is to Pakistan.

494
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,580
I'm the guy who developed
a bomb for Pakistan,

495
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,450
gave illegally, gave the
technology to run. Um,

496
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,430
I mean I'm interviewing him because um,
you know,

497
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,950
it's not only around having the bomb,
but Pakistan,

498
00:29:35,951 --> 00:29:40,951
which is quickly becoming a
failed state has a lot of,

499
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,790
uh, weapons, a ballistic weapons.
And so we're going to see,

500
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:48,610
just going over to see just how
loose the new, cause I over there

501
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,910
absolutely terrifying. What's happening.
What's scary about this though, is that,

502
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,120
um, you know, the Mexico, uh,

503
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:02,680
issue is Mexico runs the risk of turning
into a failed state as well. But again,

504
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,610
it's a booger. It's a, and by the way,

505
00:30:07,611 --> 00:30:11,830
it's a, it's a problem that we're
causing. Like, you know, it's, it's, it's,

506
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,580
you know,
it's a scary time

507
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,110
and when they're bored or quits,

508
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,450
if they become a failed state and they
stopped having patrols on their side of

509
00:30:18,451 --> 00:30:20,140
the border, you know,
we're going to have to,

510
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,020
they don't have any employees doing that.

511
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,570
We're going to have to up all
the people that work down there.

512
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,370
They're going to have to do
something to try to tie it,

513
00:30:26,371 --> 00:30:29,160
and then they're going to have to go in.
That's what's going to be really crazy.

514
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,530
They're going to have to
realize like there's an army of,

515
00:30:31,531 --> 00:30:36,531
of real it truly evil people that are
involved in a crazy criminal enterprise

516
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,120
and they're,
they're billionaires and they have,

517
00:30:39,121 --> 00:30:42,160
and they're right there and they've
become an army now and they're doing okay.

518
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:46,960
It's a joke, like whenever you're down
that you hear all these stories of,

519
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,370
you know, they're trying to
build a wall, which is he'll,

520
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,730
cause you just taught him a
hundred or go over it. But yeah,

521
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,900
will come sort of put up a wall
during the day and at night.

522
00:30:55,901 --> 00:31:00,230
They just come and take all of this stuff
for scrap, you know, because you know,

523
00:31:00,231 --> 00:31:01,990
it just,
it's impossible to do.

524
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:04,570
And if you think you're just
going to build a wall and that,

525
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:08,800
that's going to stop people from, from
going under it or over it, you're insane.

526
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,920
Yeah.
I just crazy.

527
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:14,660
I don't know how you stop something that
is out of control as the drug war in

528
00:31:14,661 --> 00:31:17,210
Mexico. It seems so crazy. It's like,

529
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,920
is there even a solution that anybody
proposes that makes sense to fix this

530
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:28,390
decriminalizing God's, I mean,
this is, this is the, the
argument is you say, look,

531
00:31:28,391 --> 00:31:32,740
it's like alcohol. You know, every,
excuse me, everyone drank and then they,

532
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,410
they made it illegal and everyone's
drag but the mob, right. Um,

533
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,960
and now you're like,

534
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,460
it's not as if the argument that if we
decriminalize drugs more people will do

535
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:43,700
drugs is,
is,

536
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:49,120
is ludicrous because no one is not buying
drugs or not taking drugs or whatever

537
00:31:49,361 --> 00:31:52,030
because it's illegal.
You can get pot anywhere,

538
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,740
you can get coke anywhere you get acid.

539
00:31:53,741 --> 00:31:57,760
Then we had sort of basically any
drug anywhere incredibly easily.

540
00:31:57,761 --> 00:32:00,010
I don't know anyone that can't
get any drug with a call of a,

541
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:05,550
yeah, but you run it. Can
I call you up later tonight

542
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,663
Brian?

543
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:12,300
And the thing is is like we said,
there's never been more right.

544
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,230
Drugs in America, never higher
quality and the better product.

545
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:16,960
So the thing is is you sit not worried.

546
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:21,850
That argument, that argument is, is his
mood. Like what you have to do is say,

547
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:26,740
okay, people are going to do drugs.
Okay, you have to decriminalize it.

548
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:30,220
And that way at least you can
regulate it or, or, or you know,

549
00:32:30,221 --> 00:32:32,980
that take the criminal element out of it.
Because quite frankly,

550
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,070
as long as people want to take drugs
and I don't see that happening,

551
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,040
you know the people are not going
to want to take drugs to anytime,

552
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:44,830
then the war will just get worse because
it's billions and billions and billions

553
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,810
and billions of dollars that is going to
be run by the criminals because it has

554
00:32:47,811 --> 00:32:49,820
to be because the government won't run it.

555
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:53,640
I also think that we have an issue
where the the people that are making the

556
00:32:53,641 --> 00:32:57,630
decisions for whether or not things
are or are not illegal have a vested

557
00:32:57,631 --> 00:33:01,020
financial interest in keeping them illegal
and that's something that we really

558
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,340
have to address in this country.

559
00:33:02,341 --> 00:33:05,850
Like what you can make money off of and
the fact that you can make money off of

560
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:09,450
people being in prison and the fact that
you can make money off of hiring more

561
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,600
law enforcement and DEA officers and
having more government programs to Radica

562
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,400
drugs, the more money that you can spend
in, the more money that you, it it,

563
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:21,390
it beefs up this whole
industry that all goes away.

564
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:26,010
If marijuana becomes legal and all goes
away, if drugs become decriminalized,

565
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:31,110
nothing happens in this country unless
there's an economic interest right now,

566
00:33:31,111 --> 00:33:34,800
there's a massive economic incest
and the drug industry. You know,

567
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:39,390
I was reading a fascinating article,
um, you know, the other the other day,

568
00:33:39,391 --> 00:33:43,730
about half of America is on prescribed
drugs and the other half is on illegal

569
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,573
drugs.

570
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:44,950
Okay.

571
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:47,530
You know, it's, it's, it's, it's there,

572
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:52,240
it's not going away and either we
come up with some sort of intelligence

573
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:57,241
solution or it's just going to get
worse and worse and worse and worse.

574
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:01,360
How is Mitt Romney is a guy
that the Republicans chose?

575
00:34:01,361 --> 00:34:03,310
How did he get past their vetting process?

576
00:34:03,311 --> 00:34:06,920
How did they not look at this guy's
past and go, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa,

577
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:10,720
you're dad was from fucking where?
How do they not do that?

578
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:14,110
How do they not let just look at the
Mormon religion in general and how people

579
00:34:14,111 --> 00:34:19,111
look at it as being a really wacky
subset of Christianity with roots in the

580
00:34:19,151 --> 00:34:20,140
ridiculous,

581
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,300
when you hear the story
that it was created by this
Joseph Smith kid who was 14

582
00:34:25,301 --> 00:34:29,260
and found golden tablets that he can
only read with a magic rock. I mean,

583
00:34:29,261 --> 00:34:33,910
it's fucking ridiculous. How
did this guy get cozy? The Guy,

584
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,300
and again,
you're right,

585
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,870
he's sort of an auto bot,
been preparing to try to beat,

586
00:34:49,871 --> 00:34:52,980
doesn't designated for his whole
life. He, he, he, you know, and, and,

587
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:56,840
and if you look at it, you just
say, look, this guy, you know,

588
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,370
it looks like a president.

589
00:34:58,371 --> 00:35:00,530
He acts like a president and
he talks like a president.

590
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:03,220
But it's like anybody like you,
Joe,

591
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,320
if you were to run for President
Obama's running for president,

592
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,520
they would find all kinds of crazy shit
in our, in our past because that's human.

593
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:14,510
What's interesting about it is he rejects
all that humanity and doesn't want to

594
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:17,210
say that he's from, actually doesn't
want to say that this stuff was going on.

595
00:35:17,211 --> 00:35:18,140
Doesn't want to admit it.

596
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,310
Does he ever addressed,

597
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,920
because it's crazy. But at the
same time you want to say, okay,

598
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:25,530
well we should be electing humans
and we shouldn't be lacking robot.

599
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,370
Has He ever been questioned
on this publicly?

600
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:34,540
Um, I know it's come up a
few times. He, he, he, he,

601
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:38,610
he's been skirting around
it until recently when he,

602
00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:43,550
I believe smoked this, spoke to the, uh,
American Latino Conference and said, um,

603
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,930
you know, uh, you know, I,
you know, I'm from Mexico.

604
00:35:45,931 --> 00:35:47,460
I'm from a Mormon colony and Mexico.

605
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,630
And also he said in the RNC speech,
you know,

606
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:56,631
my dad came from Mexico
or to Michigan and that,

607
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,510
uh, you know, we were more
minutes, but people didn't care.

608
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,140
It was more about the sports teams.
We were like,

609
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,393
address it

610
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,750
because it's coming out. But the thing
is that, to your earlier question,

611
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:12,520
about 14 minutes too late is
the reason why it has come out.

612
00:36:12,521 --> 00:36:16,010
So I wasn't the first journalist to go
down there. People found out that they,

613
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,250
you know, he was born there
and actually, you know,

614
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:22,960
it was an old story because it was a big
story when his father ran for president

615
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:27,580
and, uh, everyone went crazy. But, um,
what, what nobody did it stay there.

616
00:36:27,581 --> 00:36:30,760
I went down there three different times.
I stayed there, hung out with them.

617
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,780
I actually liked them,
you know, because they're,

618
00:36:32,781 --> 00:36:35,580
they're fighting cartels and the cartels
guys, you, like you said, they're,

619
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,310
they're in cities,

620
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:40,300
people who are cutting off heads and then
killing people at random and throwing

621
00:36:40,301 --> 00:36:44,230
grenades into nightclubs and
kidnapping and it's just, look, it's

622
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:46,603
movie.

623
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:53,310
Then these guys are standing up to them.
And then, you know, I, I respect that.

624
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:56,520
And you'd have to protect your family and,
and I believe in that.

625
00:36:56,521 --> 00:36:58,410
And I just think that,
you know,

626
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:03,360
these guys sort of doing it
on their own is crazy. And,
um, you know, when I, when I,

627
00:37:03,361 --> 00:37:06,870
when I was staying with them, you realize
that this is, this is crazy. Like,

628
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:11,260
it's not, you know, it's, it is
like a Terentino's really. And,

629
00:37:11,261 --> 00:37:15,590
and you know, the fact that you know, he,
he's his cousin, like they're all named,

630
00:37:15,591 --> 00:37:18,300
brought me. I mean, was it cousins?
They're all there. You know,

631
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:21,300
you'd think that actually this, they say
this in the piece, they're like, look,

632
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,270
I wish he would contact us because
I think we could help them.

633
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:26,640
And we got to talk to them about,
about immigration.

634
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:28,080
We've got to talk to them
about this sucks balls

635
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:34,450
we can help and we want to talk to him
about his drug policy. That's incredible.

636
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,130
Yeah.
Well because they're on the front lines.

637
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,330
They understand what it's all about.

638
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:42,400
We have to stop treating Mexico as if
it's another thing that we don't have to

639
00:37:42,401 --> 00:37:46,900
deal with. It's right next door. I mean,
it literally is connected. It is us.

640
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:51,340
You know, it's, we pretended they're two
separate countries. It's, it's so silly.

641
00:37:51,341 --> 00:37:53,110
It's just people,
just people,

642
00:37:53,111 --> 00:37:56,560
and they were born a mile this way or a
mile that way. So they're fucked. Now.

643
00:37:56,561 --> 00:37:59,920
They're not going to stand that they're
coming across left and right back and

644
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:02,500
forth. And we all know
somebody, if you live in La,

645
00:38:02,501 --> 00:38:06,020
you owe somebody who is either family
came here illegally and they came here and

646
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:09,790
it's so normal. We have to fucking
start treating them like they're us.

647
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:14,050
Like we gotta, we gotta fix that
spot. It's connected to us. You know,

648
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,150
if you're there for a little while too,
what happened was because of Nafta,

649
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:24,160
which was again, it was a, an
American policy. Um, you know, Mexico,

650
00:38:24,161 --> 00:38:27,010
northern Mexico got really
slammed because the farms,

651
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,560
they couldn't compete anymore because of
Americans still had substance use here,

652
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,520
but they didn't have subsidies. They're
all this stuff, you know, again,

653
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:38,020
you can go into that stuff for a long,
but basically Nafta, the Mexican,

654
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,030
uh,
ag agriculture.

655
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,440
So they only had two options once,

656
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,090
at least sort of agriculture
died in northern Mexico.

657
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:50,290
And that was either you sneak into
America to get jobs. And by the way,

658
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:53,020
one of the things that you
learned there is, you know, they,

659
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:55,420
these people are Mexican.
They don't want to leave their homes,

660
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,620
they don't want to leave their families.

661
00:38:56,621 --> 00:38:59,350
They don't want to leave their sons and
daughters. Of the moms or whoever it is,

662
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,200
they do it because of survival.
And when do you get your,

663
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,180
when you're faced with survival,
you'll do anything.

664
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:08,200
You don't want to crawl under
borders through rat infested tunnels.

665
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:11,560
You don't want to, you know, put your
life in the hands of coyotes and cartels.

666
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:15,010
So you know, on one side they
had to sneak into America,

667
00:39:15,011 --> 00:39:18,520
which is not a lovely process or
they have to join the cartels.

668
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:22,990
And those are the two options left to
them for survival because of policies that

669
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:26,670
were cooked up in Washington. Now I've
got to say that when you say, look, it's,

670
00:39:26,671 --> 00:39:29,340
it doesn't matter what side of
the border that's a, that's a,

671
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,840
that's an ethical and moral obligation.

672
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,770
But I'm on top of that is the majority
of the problems of northern Mexico,

673
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,410
a hundred percent caused by America.
And you sit there and say, okay,

674
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,640
it's not like Mexico was intrinsically
poor. They couldn't feed themselves this,

675
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:46,300
this all happened within the last 30
years. And, and you just sit down and say,

676
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:46,910
okay,
look,

677
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:50,770
sometime at some point we have to take
responsibility for what we're doing.

678
00:39:50,771 --> 00:39:54,970
And for sure the president, I just dates
it has to have to look at this because,

679
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,670
okay, we're worried about around
where we're worried about this.

680
00:39:57,671 --> 00:40:01,190
We're worried about that. But
guess what? Our back yard,

681
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,070
we have something that's killed 10 times.

682
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,770
The amount of American soldiers killed
in the words that we've been fighting.

683
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,140
So I don't know how it could be any worse.

684
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,390
And it just appeared over the
last decade when I was a kid,

685
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:18,260
one of the first gigs I did when
I came to California for MTV,

686
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,280
uh, in Cancun. I would never think
about doing that. Now I'd be like,

687
00:40:22,281 --> 00:40:24,950
fuck that.
That sounds crazy.

688
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,250
But back then they would have
MTV shows in Cancun. I mean,

689
00:40:28,251 --> 00:40:31,430
nobody was scared to go to Mexico.
Mexico is great. People enjoyed it.

690
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:34,700
A lot of great places to go on
vacation there and then add a nowhere.

691
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:38,950
All this violence started happening
and, and mass scale. And it's,

692
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:42,350
it's so hard for people to wrap their
heads around. But if this was in Detroit,

693
00:40:42,351 --> 00:40:46,050
if this was in New York, we would
be fucking terrified. We would be.

694
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,700
If it was in Houston, we would be fucking
terrified of this kind of violence.

695
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:53,600
But because it's in Mexico for whatever
reason, people don't think it affects us.

696
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:54,800
It's,
it's really nuts.

697
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:58,790
Like there's a giant patch of humanity
that lives in utter chaos and they are

698
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:00,860
literally physically connected to us.

699
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,090
Exactly right. Because the, the,

700
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:10,190
the increase in violence to scale up in
violence in Mexico has been the last 10

701
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:14,370
years. And it's because they tried
to implement the war on drugs.

702
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,340
And not only has it not helped an iota,

703
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:21,780
but it's led to a lot of people being
killed because what they're doing and the

704
00:41:21,781 --> 00:41:24,710
policies is there, they're
using just don't work. And the,

705
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,400
the Zetas are a perfect example.

706
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,640
Let's train a hyper group of mercenaries
that then become the worst guys who are

707
00:41:31,921 --> 00:41:35,540
our worst enemies because we
them, I mean the, the, it's, it's,

708
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:39,920
we've done such a bad job. It's literally
laughable. And we have a, uh, a series,

709
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:41,720
we're going to be doing
calls where all the adults,

710
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:43,700
cause I don't know who the fuck is
that you need to listen to lectures.

711
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,353
Not at all.

712
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,300
Yeah.
It's a weird place where at,

713
00:41:48,301 --> 00:41:53,301
where are the capabilities of our
government have been overshadowed by their

714
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:57,310
abilities. Like they, they can't see the,

715
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,740
the greater impact of what they're
doing and they make these incompetent,

716
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:05,400
ridiculous decisions and yet they have
the power to implement these stupid ideas

717
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,620
and the impact of them is tremendous.

718
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:11,990
And people who are more knowledgeable
socially who understand, you know, what,

719
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:16,230
what we, what we need to do to try to fix
the situation, they're not being heard.

720
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,040
We were all,

721
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,600
we're only hearing from the people that
are benefiting financially from the drug

722
00:42:21,601 --> 00:42:24,720
war and the, the whole
thing is all based on, Oh,

723
00:42:24,721 --> 00:42:29,721
protect the children and protect people
and drugs kill lives with nary a mention

724
00:42:30,691 --> 00:42:32,940
of the biggest issue
that this country faces,

725
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:35,700
which is the fucking
pharmaceutical drug problem.

726
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,880
There are a bunch of fucking zombies
sanctioned zombies walking our streets and

727
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,860
I know quite a few of them.

728
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:47,730
I've met quite a few people in my life
that have lost themselves to pain pills

729
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:51,900
and they get them from a doctor and they
have no problem staying medicated and

730
00:42:51,901 --> 00:42:54,330
they're gone.
They are not the same person anymore.

731
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:58,140
And this is an epidemic in this country
and it's not being addressed at the same

732
00:42:58,141 --> 00:43:02,370
time while people are
going after illegal drugs,

733
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:06,510
which for the most part aren't,
aren't the real problem in this country

734
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:10,260
for sure. I mean, if you
look at it, you say, okay,

735
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,910
we're talking mainly about pod and,
and Co coming from Mexico.

736
00:43:17,911 --> 00:43:20,270
Obviously, you know, they,
they do some, other than that,

737
00:43:20,271 --> 00:43:23,770
I'm going to be things like that,
which is not great, but the, the, the,

738
00:43:23,771 --> 00:43:26,370
the majority of heroin,
um,

739
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:30,030
and with a country or in all countries,
uh,

740
00:43:30,031 --> 00:43:32,910
over 90% estimated comes from Afghanistan,

741
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:37,350
which theoretically we've been in control
over the last 10 years and have them

742
00:43:37,351 --> 00:43:41,930
nothing to called the poppy,
uh, population growth puppy.

743
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:47,820
Um, and so what's happening now
is there's never been one heroin,

744
00:43:47,821 --> 00:43:49,440
heroin in the last 10 years.

745
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,540
A heroin use in American has doubled
places going down. Quality has gone up,

746
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,860
and that's what America is in control.

747
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:02,070
I don't know what anyone wants to talk
about conspiracy theory or this or that,

748
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:07,090
but, um, you know, if America
and Mexico, Oh really?

749
00:44:07,091 --> 00:44:10,020
Okay. Fighting, uh, you
know, a drug war hadn't yet,

750
00:44:10,021 --> 00:44:13,650
there's never been more coke or more
thought. And by the way, heroin,

751
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,660
just flooding the streets out of the
country that we control it theoretically

752
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,580
then, you know, somebody is not opening
her eyes because if you look at it,

753
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:23,090
if you want to take it down to its,
uh,

754
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:28,230
its simplest level America since it's
been running Afghanistan has become the

755
00:44:28,561 --> 00:44:31,110
largest drug dealer in the world and
the largest heroin dealer in the world.

756
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,600
That's, that's a, that's a fact because,
uh, you know, heroin addiction has,

757
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:39,330
has skyrocketed in Russia,
in, in, in, in Europe,

758
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:43,650
in America, and then in countries, you
know, that don't even have money for it.

759
00:44:43,651 --> 00:44:48,080
He didn't do the west coast of
Africa and in, and, um, um, uh,

760
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:52,740
India and Pakistan and Afghanistan and
around places where they never had a

761
00:44:52,741 --> 00:44:56,610
heroin addiction because it's gone.
It's on the trail. And by the way,

762
00:44:56,611 --> 00:45:01,320
this is during a time when,
you know, theoretically we're
supposed to be in there,

763
00:45:01,321 --> 00:45:05,460
uh, uh, regulating the country. Well,
we're not, and I don't know why,

764
00:45:05,461 --> 00:45:06,710
but I get to tell you were always,

765
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,730
a lot of people are making a
lot of money off that airline.

766
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,840
Well, Shane Smith, it sounds
like you hate America.

767
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:14,530
That's what I hear when I hate talking
like this sounds like you hate America.

768
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:20,320
I do not know what I'm saying man.
That's the argument against it. I mean,

769
00:45:20,321 --> 00:45:25,060
it's so blatant and one of the weirdest
things is watching video of US soldiers

770
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:30,190
guarding poppy fields. I'm sure
you've seen those. That is so surreal,

771
00:45:30,191 --> 00:45:33,040
man. It's so, it's so like on your face.

772
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:36,540
America. I'm, I'm the, I'm the
perfect example of the American dream.

773
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:41,460
I came down here and, and you know,
started a company and, and, and you know,

774
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:46,230
uh, hired a bunch of people and I love
the promise of America. I love the people.

775
00:45:46,231 --> 00:45:48,300
I think it's the greatest
country in the world.

776
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:53,070
What I don't like is the fact that
we suck up so much propaganda.

777
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,010
I don't know how it's
different than Nazi Germany.

778
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,220
Nazi Germany was doing bad shit,
but they said, no, no, it's okay.

779
00:45:59,221 --> 00:46:03,360
We're doing good shit. And then I
went, okay, and how are we different?

780
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:05,470
Like this is the land of the
free. We're supposed to, you know,

781
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:09,630
we're supposed to have a free media that
tells the truth and then we make up our

782
00:46:09,631 --> 00:46:13,950
own, our own minds. What I'm saying
is, okay, I love, I love this coaching,

783
00:46:13,951 --> 00:46:17,070
but if I want to, you know,
I'm going to tell the truth.

784
00:46:17,071 --> 00:46:21,110
And if if we're know
complicit in, in, you know,

785
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,340
doubling heroin addicts in America,

786
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:26,180
then we have to know that if
we're complicit and you know,

787
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:28,620
50,000 murders in Mexico,

788
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:31,980
then I'm going to say that because
otherwise if nobody's saying it,

789
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:35,010
then guess what? How are we different
than Nazi Germany? I don't fucking know.

790
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:35,501
Yeah,

791
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:40,060
well we got a bunch of lazy unpatriotic
motherfuckers running this thing because

792
00:46:40,061 --> 00:46:43,870
if people really were patriotic and
really wanted to Spec the ideal of what

793
00:46:43,871 --> 00:46:45,100
America is supposed to be,

794
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:47,980
there would never be any
problem with freedom of press.

795
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:51,100
They would never be any problem like
what's going on with Wiki leaks this way.

796
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:55,090
It would be something where they would
want to take account and look at the

797
00:46:55,091 --> 00:46:56,740
grievances that the people have.

798
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:01,900
But we're running by lazy people that
they don't have this idea of the perfect

799
00:47:01,901 --> 00:47:05,620
Utopian society that we think that we
can all aspire to and can be created

800
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:08,740
someday.
We all hope if humanity keeps evolving,

801
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:11,360
that we're going to get
past this ridiculous, uh,

802
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:15,760
system of crime and violence and poverty
and eventually move on to some elevated

803
00:47:15,761 --> 00:47:16,930
level of society,

804
00:47:16,931 --> 00:47:21,700
some elevated state of consciousness
where we all can get along together and we

805
00:47:21,701 --> 00:47:25,780
basically can eliminate
violence and eliminate all
the bullshit aspects that are

806
00:47:25,781 --> 00:47:30,781
created by inequality and losers and
doing a shitty job of raising children.

807
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,060
And I think that this is something
that we should all aspire to.

808
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:36,400
This is something that we
should all look towards.

809
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:40,730
And when our government is being run
by hacks and dummies, it's, it's,

810
00:47:40,731 --> 00:47:42,130
it's a real problem.

811
00:47:42,131 --> 00:47:45,610
And when they placate to all these
dummies out there that you know,

812
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:48,220
form special interest groups and you know,
right wing,

813
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:53,170
crazy religious wings and it's there,
they're all doing themselves a disservice.

814
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:56,830
Everybody should be trying to move this
fucking thing further than where it's at

815
00:47:56,831 --> 00:48:00,010
right now. And with rational
discussion and logical thinking,

816
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:03,380
you look at it and you go, okay,
this drug thing is a big problem,

817
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,920
but you got to fix this and who's
making money and how is this?

818
00:48:05,921 --> 00:48:08,920
Where's this money going?
Just knowing those numbers,

819
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:11,140
the government should be
chasing that down on TV.

820
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:14,410
They should be going ladies and
gentlemen, the Afghanistan, you know,

821
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:18,700
opium supplies 90% of the world's opioid
supply. We're in control of Afghanistan.

822
00:48:18,701 --> 00:48:21,430
So we're trying to figure out where
the fuck this money's going. But no,

823
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:23,800
it's just something instead
that's never even brought up.

824
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,450
It's swept under the table.

825
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:28,990
Whoever is making money
off of it continues to make
money off of it and we're

826
00:48:28,991 --> 00:48:33,160
supposed to just ignore it, you
know, because honey booboo is on TV,

827
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:34,623
you know

828
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:40,573
it's true.

829
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:48,350
This country was founded on a weekend,
like a modern day utopia and you know,

830
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:50,120
it's founded on the American dream and,

831
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:54,470
and the thing is is that shouldn't go
away. That should be number one thing.

832
00:48:54,471 --> 00:48:56,920
But it also has to be founded on truth.
And the thing is,

833
00:48:56,921 --> 00:48:58,880
is what I tried to do is find truth.

834
00:48:58,881 --> 00:49:02,060
And what you do is you find that
truth and then, and then say, look,

835
00:49:02,061 --> 00:49:04,640
now we have to action that truth.
And I think if there's a lot more,

836
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:08,330
I believe there's a lot of people like
you and there's a lot of people like me

837
00:49:08,331 --> 00:49:12,770
up there and we do. We become
disenfranchised because
media is a big business.

838
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:14,840
You know, we're sort of,
you know, pushed out.

839
00:49:14,841 --> 00:49:17,630
There's only two parties in
this country and you know that,

840
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,440
I know that you're a
libertarian. And I'm like, look,

841
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,100
I think there should be three,
four or five parties in this country.

842
00:49:25,101 --> 00:49:27,860
Because if there's only two parties in
the country, then they're always in power.

843
00:49:27,861 --> 00:49:30,620
That means both parties are always
empowered. And that's not a democracy.

844
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:34,070
What you have to do is you have to say,
look,

845
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:35,630
there's a lot of people like us out there.

846
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:39,230
We have to start by telling the truth
and then once we told the truth,

847
00:49:39,231 --> 00:49:42,770
we have to say, now what do we do to
try to go forward and not go backwards.

848
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:46,880
And when people have to understand his
true patriotism is pointing out all the

849
00:49:46,881 --> 00:49:48,890
fucked up shit that you see.
True.

850
00:49:48,891 --> 00:49:52,250
Patriotism is not just sticking your
head in the sand and ignoring it because

851
00:49:52,251 --> 00:49:53,420
you're on team America.

852
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:58,010
That's bad because these people are not
representing what means America to you

853
00:49:58,011 --> 00:50:02,810
or to I what means America to you and
I's opportunity and freedom and the place

854
00:50:02,811 --> 00:50:03,440
where you can.

855
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,280
There's not really a caste system and
you can really rise from rags to riches

856
00:50:07,281 --> 00:50:08,750
and you can really seek your dreams.

857
00:50:08,751 --> 00:50:11,230
I mean there's so many different
things you can do in America. The the,

858
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,490
the upside of America is fucking awesome.

859
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:17,450
And the pretend that somehow or
another ignoring all the corruption and

860
00:50:17,451 --> 00:50:20,810
craziness and all the things
that turned it into a money grab,

861
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,550
all the things that ruin everything.

862
00:50:22,551 --> 00:50:26,840
That's great about America where
our government has been as become a,

863
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,760
where people can regulate
the flow of money.

864
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:34,810
The decisions that government make are
all greatly influenced by corporations

865
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:38,390
and when you see you connect the dots
and you connect the the money trail,

866
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:41,180
it's disgusting.
It should be illegal.

867
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:43,670
It should be eradicated for
government from government.

868
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:45,530
Government should not be about that.

869
00:50:45,531 --> 00:50:49,040
Government should be about the will of
the people and the will of the people

870
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:53,480
where they've sat down and intelligently
debated every single situation.

871
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:54,523
You know with the,

872
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:58,220
if the United States government can
have a real succinct debate with the

873
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:01,310
American people about why
we're invading other countries,

874
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:05,150
that would be some fascinating shit if
we could do that on television and have

875
00:51:05,151 --> 00:51:06,320
her, but no, we don't get,

876
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:10,070
we don't get any decision
making capabilities at all
when it comes to that stuff.

877
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:13,880
We just have to choose an a representative
and then watch them do shit we don't

878
00:51:13,881 --> 00:51:14,714
want them to do.

879
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:20,000
You know, we've talked about
this in the past as well,

880
00:51:20,001 --> 00:51:23,570
but when I went to the
Middle East where they have

881
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:33,580
all come to sell their weapons and they
come to sell their weapons to, you know,

882
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:37,700
whoever wants to buy them. You know,
North Korea is about weapons. Uh,

883
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:39,800
well for example, Siri,
it was buying weapons.

884
00:51:39,801 --> 00:51:42,990
They're examined and they were using
those weapons against her own people. Um,

885
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,260
and that's sponsored by us and
it's our companies, uh, that are,

886
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:50,610
that are making those arms, uh,
to, to, to suppress democracy,

887
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:55,590
to kill people. And we just
care about making money. And
when I saw that, you know,

888
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,050
I was, I was, I was bombed.

889
00:51:57,051 --> 00:52:01,420
But when I hung out with the Marines
who were there as part of a, the,

890
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,880
as part of the cell effects, they do this
sort of that bad. It's the, you know,

891
00:52:04,881 --> 00:52:09,110
a special ops team on the planet and a
force recon the marines were there and

892
00:52:09,111 --> 00:52:11,120
they're like, hold on a second. These,

893
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,330
these weapons are being used against us.

894
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:19,010
They were here as they're just
selling them like that. A model,

895
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:20,240
this is what the fuck is going on.

896
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:24,770
And when you actually talk to people in
the military about that kind of shit,

897
00:52:24,771 --> 00:52:28,490
or using Marines to,
uh, to be protection on,

898
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:29,870
on Halliburton trucks,

899
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:34,220
bringing like a six pack because
they get paid per truck load,

900
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,310
you just start to go, what
the fuck is happening? I mean,

901
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:42,520
if you talk to most people in the military
who saw that kind of stuff happened

902
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:46,760
in Iraq, they're there. They're
there, they're disgusted.

903
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:51,140
I'm disgusted. And I only heard about
it. I didn't have to risk my life. Uh,

904
00:52:51,141 --> 00:52:54,230
you know, to do that kind of stuff. And
then at a certain point you're like, look,

905
00:52:54,231 --> 00:52:58,380
when we can't use our military as
cannon fodder, you know, did that,

906
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:02,540
I don't know what the hell
is going on, you know, with,

907
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:05,780
with these kinds of deals. But you
know, when we were at so effects,

908
00:53:05,781 --> 00:53:07,400
the marines were, you
know, it made me cry.

909
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,730
They'll tell you the truth because
these guys came to the realization that

910
00:53:10,731 --> 00:53:13,970
American companies are selling weapons
to other armies that are using those

911
00:53:13,971 --> 00:53:14,804
weapons to kill us.

912
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:19,290
It's such a fucking mess,
man, and not being addressed.

913
00:53:19,291 --> 00:53:23,310
It should be one of the primary issues
that our society deals with is where's

914
00:53:23,311 --> 00:53:26,100
the money going?
Where our dollars going,

915
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,670
how are they being represented in these
foreign countries and what is the actual

916
00:53:29,671 --> 00:53:32,220
physical liability of it?
How many people have actually died?

917
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,950
I've never seen a real honest
accounting of that either.

918
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:39,210
Like you look at the innocent and amount
of innocent deaths in Iraq and if it

919
00:53:39,211 --> 00:53:43,080
varies from the really conservative
people but wring it into like a hundred

920
00:53:43,081 --> 00:53:45,210
thousand that's like the
really conservative people.

921
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,100
But the people that are really

922
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:52,320
adamant against the war have it erotica
million. I don't know what it is

923
00:53:56,230 --> 00:54:01,020
tied together. It's over a million
and you're like, okay, so you guys,

924
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:05,400
we had to go and get what I'm saying.
I'll compete with an evil dictator.

925
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:07,940
But what about all the
African evil dictators?

926
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:11,630
What about Charles Taylor in Liberia?
You know, did we get him out? No,

927
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:15,010
we supported him. I mean
like, you know, well,

928
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:17,040
well did they have oil?

929
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:22,180
You know what? We need dude, for
real. We need like real live Avengers.

930
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:25,930
We really need like superheroes
who are bulletproof.

931
00:54:25,931 --> 00:54:29,320
It could turn into the hulk and
just go in over there and fuck up,

932
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:31,060
you know like dictators and take,

933
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:34,450
I mean really if science and engineers
are working on things like that,

934
00:54:34,451 --> 00:54:36,280
they need to develop a real superheros.

935
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:37,360
That's the only thing that's going to say.

936
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:42,860
I know that you just got your black belt,
you to be our first superhero.

937
00:54:42,861 --> 00:54:43,440
Congrats.

938
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,920
Double
Double Rainbow.

939
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:52,990
Yeah. I got my black belt today from John
Jacques Machado. Both of them like, no,

940
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:53,580
no, no, no, no.

941
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:58,170
Where one of them is like a symbolic
in Nogi you don't really wear a belt,

942
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:02,370
but you get to wear a black rash guard
if you want, but it's a in John jocks.

943
00:55:02,371 --> 00:55:06,490
It's a GE class are we're a black belt,
like actual belt. That's awesome. Yeah.

944
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,240
Thank you. Thanks brother.
As an honor. Listen man,

945
00:55:09,241 --> 00:55:13,050
when you going to be back in La again,
we've got to have these fucking long,

946
00:55:13,051 --> 00:55:15,270
long crazy conversations
that we always have.

947
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,750
I know you have a bunch of other press
that you're doing for this and you've got

948
00:55:17,751 --> 00:55:18,584
to go.

949
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:24,710
I love you. I love being on the show.
I wish it could be there in person.

950
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:28,850
I really appreciate being on the show,

951
00:55:28,851 --> 00:55:33,680
but I know you got another a guest
and I won't take up any more time,

952
00:55:33,681 --> 00:55:36,140
but I love you. I love the show.
Congratulations on the block.

953
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:37,610
Oh thank you.

954
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:41,200

Holy Shit Dude. The feeling is mutual.

958
00:55:55,921 --> 00:55:58,760
I was a huge fan of yours before.
I haven't met you and now I'm,

959

965
00:56:16,411 --> 00:56:21,240
most interesting, most
intriguing, the most baffling
mystifying shit in the world.

966
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,260
And uh,

967

968
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:31,290
Bye Bye Shane.

969
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:35,170
Shane might be one of the cools humans
on the planet. He's fearless man.

970
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:39,730
This motherfucker's just telling us he's
going to Pakistan and I ran and I rack

972
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,900
Come on over here.
You sexy bitch.

973
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:51,790
Sam Tripoli and Brian Redman
when my dancing partners
this weekend in Sacramento,

974
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:55,330
first of all,
how fucking awesome is Sacramento.

975
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:00,520
Sacramento's like one of those lost gems
of a city that people don't recognize.

976
00:57:00,581 --> 00:57:03,310
You know when people talk about
like cool cities to go to,

977
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:08,470
like you gotta throw Sacramento in that
mix. Sacramento is fucking bad ass.

978
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:10,570
It's beautiful up there.

979
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:14,800
It was weird flying in and seeing these
crazy river systems they have up there

980
00:57:14,801 --> 00:57:18,070
and seeing all the farms and you
realize like irrigation. Yeah,

981
00:57:18,071 --> 00:57:21,700
there's a big slice of
California that is just farms,

982
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,880
you know when you're flying over
it and looking down at that shit.

983
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,680
Sacramento's interesting cause like I was,
you know,

984
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:30,280
doing the show and they're like
I said something about every,

985
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:35,340
all the MMA fighters and adult film
stars come from Sag. They look good,

986
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:38,980
Sacramento and it's like, it's
a great city, man. It's like,

987
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,940
I know you guys think it sucks, but it's
pretty phenomenal man. Oh it's great.

988
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:46,180
It's a great place to live. You're
Ryan famous, cut a fat setup up there.

989
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:50,530
He's got this huge gym and
all that. A team, Alpha male
dudes. And they were like,

990
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:51,660
I love their setup too,

991
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:54,310
because they also bought like
houses together on a street.

992
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:57,010
They call it like the block.
I think that's cool. Yeah.

993
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:00,490
And so they all live in one neighborhood.
So like one guy lives here,

994
00:58:00,491 --> 00:58:01,630
they're like,
I was across the street,

995
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,700
which is what I've been
wanting to do for a long time.

996
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:06,010
I think that would be the
fucking coolest thing ever.

997
00:58:06,011 --> 00:58:08,880
And I've been stressing it lately with
all my friends and we had an icehouse

998
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:11,680
protocols here the other day. We all got
hammered and we were talking about it.

999
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,570
We're all like, we're going to
move to Santa Barbara. Fuck it.

1000
00:58:13,571 --> 00:58:16,630
We're all gonna move to great city,
dude. It's a fucking great city.

1001
00:58:16,631 --> 00:58:20,320
And what I was thinking is
gigging there soon. We just did.

1002
00:58:20,321 --> 00:58:24,910
I just did the Lobero theater there. How
was it? Fucking phenomenal. Coolest shit.

1003
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,820
There's no standup up there.
There's no standup.

1004
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:30,460
It's this great town and they don't
have a goddamn comedy club. Well,

1005
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:35,020
it's really weird because it's
a, it's a late, late night crowd.

1006
00:58:35,021 --> 00:58:37,870
It's like you don't come
out til like 10 at night.

1007
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:41,770
And then like before that it's
really dead. I like State Street,

1008
00:58:41,771 --> 00:58:45,000
which is their main street. Really?
Yeah. I've done shows out there.

1009
00:58:45,001 --> 00:58:46,480
There's a lot of people
in the daytime there.

1010
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,670
I've been there a couple of times in the
day times a lot of people down there.

1011
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:50,350
It's got everything.

1012
00:58:50,351 --> 00:58:54,430
You want a very intelligent and becomes
like a more of a nighttime crowd.

1013
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,710
Like a nightclub type cloud crowd.
Yeah,

1014
00:58:56,711 --> 00:59:00,040
they'd be in all the good people hide
that we're hanging out during the day,

1015
00:59:00,041 --> 00:59:03,700
buying like little gifts and stuff
like that. And then we'll just repeat.

1016
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:08,510
Nightlife goes in like two lost some
colleges there and there's a very uh,

1017
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:13,300
intelligent population there. So it's
like the perfect place for a comedy club.

1018
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,180
And he noted also is a lot
of old Hollywood is there.

1019
00:59:16,181 --> 00:59:20,650
Why was our soft Carol
Burnett for Calvert? Calvert
net fucking looks good man.

1020
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:24,080
She still looks good. She's like 79 she
looked great. I was like, Holy Shit.

1021
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:25,400
That's Carol Burnett.
You know,

1022
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:29,240
there's a lot of like old Hollywood
that lives there. They're like,

1023
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:31,460
they checked out and they
moved up to this one spot.

1024
00:59:31,461 --> 00:59:35,210
They all agreed to go to this one spot.
I Dunno, I dunno how they pulled it off,

1025
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:38,630
but it's basically one of the
fucking best climates on earth.

1026
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:43,340
It never gets hotter than weather's per
gets like it's from 85 to 65 all year

1027
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:46,100
round. That's it. That's like
the hole that's all year round.

1028
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:49,100
I like San Diego a little more
like just outside of San Diego.

1029
00:59:49,101 --> 00:59:51,860
But both those cities are pretty,
San Diego is phenomenal.

1030
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,990
But what we were talking about,
you couldn't hear because you were,

1031
00:59:53,991 --> 00:59:55,880
you didn't have headphones on.
We sitting back there,

1032
00:59:55,881 --> 00:59:59,630
but we were talking about with Shane
Smith was Mexico and how crazy Mexico is

1033
00:59:59,631 --> 01:00:02,720
because of the drug wars. And I
heard part of it. Yeah. Phenomenal.

1034
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:06,780
That's phenomenal. It amazing.
He's amazing guy. But,

1035
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:09,890
but Mexico is right next to San Diego.
I mean that is uh,

1036
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:13,520
one of the nuttiest things about
this country is that La Jolla,

1037
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:16,460
which has some of the most
beautiful homes on earth.

1038
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:21,380
I mean La Jolla is fucking staggering.
Where that comedy story is the views.

1039
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,980
Have you ever like looked over at some
of those houses and you look out in those

1040
01:00:24,981 --> 01:00:27,120
views, you're like, oh
my God, what is this?

1041
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:32,370
When time I did a show there and these
two drunk like cougar or at the show and

1042
01:00:32,651 --> 01:00:35,260
they just got shit faced and then
afterwards they came out, they're like,

1043
01:00:35,261 --> 01:00:38,240
you get in the car.
And they pointed me and it was this,

1044
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,390
this Bentley and I just
jumped in like is bent.

1045
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:45,730
And they drove me around and they took
me in this area and it was the biggest

1046
01:00:45,731 --> 01:00:49,900
house I've ever seen. And it's
like, there are some rich, rich

1047
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:51,630
people in La Jolla.
Oh yeah.

1048
01:00:51,631 --> 01:00:54,930
Well there's also that core
Natto island that's right there,

1049
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:57,990
that is apparently one of
the richest places on earth.

1050
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,470
That's where Donald Rumsfeld lives.
He lives on this island.

1051
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:05,610
Like they have all these
castles and fucking, you know,
billionaires lived there,

1052
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:09,090
isn't it right after like Manhattan,
it's like the most expensive lamp

1053
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:11,970
per square foot,
Coronado islands right up there.

1054
01:01:11,971 --> 01:01:16,260
I think it's supposed to be like this
really elite community have looked at some

1055
01:01:16,261 --> 01:01:19,470
of the houses online and they
are just fucking jaw dropping.

1056
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:22,230
They're like palaces like works of art.
You know,

1057
01:01:22,231 --> 01:01:26,730
like someone's just put tons and millions
and millions of dollars into fucking,

1058
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:29,880
you know, big importing marble
and all this crazy shit.

1059
01:01:29,881 --> 01:01:32,430
And you're looking at it like,
what a fucking house man.

1060
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:36,870
And then you can walk to Mexico. Yeah.
You could walk to Tijuana from that.

1061
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:41,850
That's crazy man. You could get there in
a day on foot. Just walking wild west.

1062
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:44,880
Just think about the old days like when,
when countries,

1063
01:01:44,881 --> 01:01:48,360
like when you really did like people
did walk around like in the Conan the

1064
01:01:48,361 --> 01:01:52,440
barbarian days, they really like got on
horses or they walked from town to town.

1065
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:57,590
You could walk from La Jolla to Tia Juana
and you could get there easily and a

1066
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:00,270
couple of hours. What is it?
How many miles is it? Well,

1067
01:02:00,271 --> 01:02:04,710
I think La Jolla is about like 20
minutes from downtown San Diego,

1068
01:02:04,711 --> 01:02:08,490
which is about probably like five to
10 minutes from the, from the border,

1069
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:10,080
so it's like,
it's like 20 miles.

1070
01:02:10,081 --> 01:02:12,930
San Diego Downtown San Diego is only
five to 10 minutes from the border.

1071
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:15,690
It's like right there. Wow. Yeah.

1072
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:19,010
I took a wrong turn on the way home
from comic con and I was going that

1073
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:20,430
direction. I was like, Holy Shit,

1074
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:23,730
I need to turn around before I,
I can't believe I'm going to match.

1075
01:02:23,731 --> 01:02:28,560
She was Jesus Christ. Well, I
enjoyed that American comedy company.

1076
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:31,290
A place that we worked out.
It's a beautiful club.

1077
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:33,780
Is there issues now or are we
going to be going back there?

1078
01:02:33,781 --> 01:02:38,040
Sam Aaa that's going on
there. I, I was a great time.

1079
01:02:38,041 --> 01:02:42,750
It was just a discussion between me and
him on the wording of the deal and the

1080
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:47,280
wording of, uh, what the show he
agreed to him, what he actually got.

1081
01:02:47,281 --> 01:02:49,560
And I don't want to get into it.
Well listen man,

1082
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:53,020
we can start doing regular
shows in San Diego. You know,

1083
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,910
we could Kodaly start doing that.
We've got to do it to everywhere.

1084
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,800
Should do it everywhere. And Diego,
Santa Barbara, wherever we want,

1085
01:02:58,801 --> 01:03:00,570
we can drive to, I mean it's, I'm,

1086
01:03:00,571 --> 01:03:03,990
I'm doing all these road gigs and there's
a lot of shit that I could do around

1087
01:03:03,991 --> 01:03:08,460
la too that we need to do more often. But
the comedy store, I'm in, uh, the, uh,

1088
01:03:08,461 --> 01:03:11,130
the ice house, which is my new
version of the comedy store.

1089
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,590
I can't do the comedy store anymore,
but I do the ice house.

1090
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:16,010
I would love to see you come
back at some point. Yeah.

1091
01:03:16,011 --> 01:03:17,250
It told you that it has to happen.

1092
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:21,780
Certain people have pit by
meteors and abducted by aliens.

1093
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,900
When we were flying
back from a Sacramento,

1094
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:28,320
a woman sat in the middle of me and red
band and she must've been loving life.

1095
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:29,460
But uh,

1096
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:34,460
she's from Chico and Chico and their
Santa Rosa and there's all those awesome

1097
01:03:35,251 --> 01:03:35,771
parties,

1098
01:03:35,771 --> 01:03:40,640
cities that have these gorgeous theaters
that they have nothing going on. Right,

1099
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:41,460
right,
right.

1100
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:45,300
Go out there and do a couple theater
gigs and make some great cash out there.

1101
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,680
Yeah. And you know, places, if you could
do a show in a place like Santa Barbara,

1102
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:51,930
you can do, do a show in a
number, a number of different
places like that. There's,

1103
01:03:51,931 --> 01:03:55,710
they're all, there's 20 million of us
here. Yeah. In La it's pretty nutty.

1104
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:59,370
And then there's all the fucking nor shit
Ventura where nobody goes to, you know,

1105
01:03:59,371 --> 01:04:01,830
nobody ever. When was the last time
you saw commonly shown Ventura?

1106
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:06,750
There's a venture, a comedy, a
comedy club. It's to a new place.

1107
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:09,050
No, it's, well, it's been
there for a little while. It's,

1108
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:13,260
it sounded like a boat harbor
and it's actually a really fun,

1109
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:16,140
I think Diaz told me he did
that the das do that play.

1110
01:04:16,141 --> 01:04:18,990
You got to pick certain nights cause
he likes it really clean there. Oh,

1111
01:04:18,991 --> 01:04:21,410
how dare he,
which I don't understand where the exits,

1112
01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:25,140
like I get the comedy magic club because
that's kind of a tradition and it's

1113
01:04:25,141 --> 01:04:29,100
Kinda like a thing there.
But like at certain place to live,

1114
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,490
you got to keep it clean. It's
like where does that exist? Silly,

1115
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,590
this silly comedy,

1116
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:38,100
the idea of keeping it clean for standup
comedy in that you're selling the wrong

1117
01:04:38,101 --> 01:04:39,780
thing.
There can be clean guys.

1118
01:04:39,781 --> 01:04:42,660
There's going to always be guys like
Gaffigan who are fucking hilarious.

1119
01:04:42,661 --> 01:04:45,960
Who's clean or Mitch Hedberg, who's
one of my all time favorites. Yup.

1120
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:49,710
And Mitch Mitch Hedberg was very
clean, very clean. There's no sex.

1121
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:53,640
Very rarely swore. Didn't
need to swear. You know,

1122
01:04:53,641 --> 01:04:57,310
and if he swore it was like
an afterthought, you know,
fuck man, you know, it's,

1123
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:00,240
and there's not like a part of his bed.
He didn't have to have the swearing it.

1124
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:04,380
And, uh, you know, he was brilliant, but
that was his style man. That was what he,

1125
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,920
that's the way he did his comedy. And
you know, the way you do your comedy,

1126
01:05:07,921 --> 01:05:09,660
you swear the way Diaz does his comedy.

1127
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:13,410
I couldn't imagine someone telling me
that Joey Diaz could be the same with Joey

1128
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,230
Diaz didn't square it because
that's crazy. That's crazy tight.

1129
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:19,180
And it's a stupid way to think.
No, I didn't know Mitch Hedberg,

1130
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:22,490
but how he offstage was he
that guy off stage? I'd,

1131
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:26,950
it's like usually how you are off stage,
you should be that onstage to a degree,

1132
01:05:26,951 --> 01:05:31,630
you know, maybe even amplify it. Oh, well
he does. He was a regular guy. I mean,

1133
01:05:31,631 --> 01:05:34,330
I only had a chance to talk to him a few
times. I never really hung out with him,

1134
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:35,800
but he was good buddies with Stan hope.

1135
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:38,530
But I did get to work with them a couple
of times to work with them at the store

1136
01:05:38,531 --> 01:05:43,420
once and he was a good dude. It's just a
regular guy. But his comedy was, uh, just,

1137
01:05:43,421 --> 01:05:46,810
he had to such a unique cadence
to it. You know, in a unique,

1138
01:05:46,811 --> 01:05:51,700
sort of a really relaxed, silly,
uh, um, observations on things.

1139
01:05:51,701 --> 01:05:55,900
It was really fun to watch. But
you know, again, nothing like me,

1140
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,260
squeaky clean, nothing like me,
but I still love it. You know,

1141
01:05:59,261 --> 01:06:03,520
I think comedy is just who are you?
Who are you? Are you Tony Hinchcliffe?

1142
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:08,160
Are you Sam Tripoli or you Brian Redman?
Who the fuck are you and your comedy?

1143
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:13,480
Brian's has a lot of silly shit that I
really would never pull off on stage with

1144
01:06:13,481 --> 01:06:15,760
him,
with his personality and his,

1145
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:20,790
it's like everybody has their own vision
of what is funny and you can't say,

1146
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:24,940
you know, oh, inforce your vision, but do
it with limited language. I want you to,

1147
01:06:24,941 --> 01:06:28,750
I want you to not be free
to say everything you want
or discuss everything you

1148
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:32,920
want. I'm not saying that you
should discuss sex or you know,

1149
01:06:32,921 --> 01:06:37,090
or anything fucked up,
anything controversial, but
if you want to, you should,

1150
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:39,320
you shouldn't, but you, you,

1151
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:42,580
you mean it's not like you have to do
it because every people have gotten by,

1152
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:46,630
like Jerry Seinfeld never talks about
politics on stage, never talks about sex,

1153
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,960
but yet brilliant comic and
it has this amazing career.

1154
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:51,820
It's like you don't have to do anything.

1155
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,760
I can appreciate Stan hope and Bill Hicks.

1156
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:58,000
And then I also grew up loving Ellen.

1157
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:00,850
I Alan's like standup
is very simple to me,

1158
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:05,650
but it's very funny and it's well written
and I like to think that maybe that's

1159
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:10,360
her. I mean I, I've never really watched
her talk show. She started at all.

1160
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:14,050
I mean, before she ever had a talk show,
she was doing great standup. She didn't,

1161
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:17,470
you know, I don't think she had writers.
It's all her. Yeah. Jeff Foxworthy.

1162
01:07:17,471 --> 01:07:20,680
Same thing. Like you can,
you know, give him that, you
know, you might be a redneck,

1163
01:07:20,681 --> 01:07:25,080
but like his standup is, I always thought
was very well written and very fun.

1164
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:29,350
It's good joke writer. Yeah,
he's got great. Some of you
might be a redneck shit.

1165
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:34,000
Look, people discount it because you know
they love to discount redneck anything,

1166
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:38,530
you know, but this is a lot of,
that's good fucking writing. So good.

1167
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,030
So popular it,

1168
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:43,240
it almost becomes like I have to
hate it because everybody loves it.

1169
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:46,390
There's a little of that. I felt that
it was a little going on with Larry,

1170
01:07:46,391 --> 01:07:50,410
the cable guy. You know Larry, the cable
guy I've always felt was a fun character.

1171
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:54,060
He's funny. I think his
writing is good. I, I've, I've,

1172
01:07:54,061 --> 01:07:57,130
I've seen some of his shows.
He's a fucking good comic man.

1173
01:07:57,131 --> 01:08:01,570
He made me laugh and he took
a gigantic rash of shit,

1174
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:06,280
which I feel was mostly based on
just people like, first of all,

1175
01:08:06,281 --> 01:08:08,200
everybody has their own
taste as far as comedy goes,

1176
01:08:08,201 --> 01:08:11,680
but there's a one weird thing that
people do if they have a certain type of

1177
01:08:11,681 --> 01:08:15,130
taste. Your taste has got to be
wrong. You know, if you're, you're,

1178
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:17,480
what you're doing is bullshit.
You're like, you could,

1179
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:21,680
I've heard the argument that, you
know, dice clay is homophobic. Dice.

1180
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:25,460
Clay is a, is a, he's a massage
and as he's this and that,

1181
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:28,990
that if you don't say that,
that is a crazy exaggerated,

1182
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:33,800
exaggerated character that he's just
going over the brink for the sake of

1183
01:08:33,801 --> 01:08:36,650
entertainment.
Like if you want to hold him to stand up,

1184
01:08:36,651 --> 01:08:40,010
if that's who he is really as a
human being, you're ridiculous.

1185
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,560
You're ridiculous person.
I agree. And you know, if,

1186
01:08:42,561 --> 01:08:44,960
if someone else was saying it
maybe looked a little different,

1187
01:08:44,961 --> 01:08:45,980
they wouldn't be so angry.

1188
01:08:45,981 --> 01:08:50,620
It's so interesting how it's so much
more the messenger that in the message he

1189
01:08:50,621 --> 01:08:53,450
something that comes with
comedy right now. Well,

1190
01:08:53,451 --> 01:08:56,630
it's also when you're get famous and
you have a lot on the line, like if, uh,

1191
01:08:56,870 --> 01:09:00,880
like the what with Daniel Tosh said that
all that stuff that got, uh, you know,

1192
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:02,240
everybody all fired up.

1193
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:05,690
If he was nobody and said that
no one would have given a shit.

1194
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:08,990
It was the fact that he's,
the sky was this huge comedy central show.

1195
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:13,700
He allegedly said something that pissed
some woman off about rape. That's,

1196
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:17,960
that's where the, the impact
came from. The impact came
from, he had a lot to lose.

1197
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:20,810
And that's this weird thing where we
got in this country because immediately

1198
01:09:20,811 --> 01:09:24,620
people were calling out for
him to be fired. He should
lose his job. But he said,

1199
01:09:24,621 --> 01:09:28,350
first of all, besides it not
being that big a deal, it was a,

1200
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:30,380
it was a normal thing
to say in a comedy club.

1201
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:32,960
It also had nothing to do with his
television show. Right. You know,

1202
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:33,800
and to say that,
you know,

1203
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:37,370
he should be held accountable to every
word that comes out of his mouth when

1204
01:09:37,371 --> 01:09:39,530
he's adlibbing living on
stage in a comedy club.

1205
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:43,130
You don't understand the art of comedy
then and you have no fucking business

1206
01:09:43,131 --> 01:09:44,420
judging it because you know,

1207
01:09:44,421 --> 01:09:48,710
and I know that when you're in the fucking
heat and bullets are flying your way

1208
01:09:48,711 --> 01:09:52,820
and you're interacting with a heckler
and you got, you got, you got to respond.

1209
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:57,770
There's a brief window of maybe a second
or two after the word where you really

1210
01:09:57,771 --> 01:10:01,910
have impact, where you have the
instant correct answer and boom,

1211
01:10:01,911 --> 01:10:02,950
you got to drop it on that bit

1212
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,590
that you're going to drive
Sacramento course. It did.

1213
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:08,840
I had to put some people in their place,

1214
01:10:08,841 --> 01:10:11,180
which was really hard because
the room is all black,

1215
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,270
so you can't even see who you're
dealing with. Well, this is just,

1216
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:17,030
it's not that the real,
it's the spotlight is super powerful too,

1217
01:10:17,031 --> 01:10:19,490
and it's in your face and
all you see is silhouettes.

1218
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:22,880
I have a big problem
within this country and uh,

1219
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:26,360
with the whole notion that if you
say something I don't like, uh,

1220
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:30,890
you have to go away and I can't,
we can't disagree on a point.

1221
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:35,470
It drives me nuts. Like, you know, I, I,
I'm a liberal guy and there's sometimes,

1222
01:10:35,471 --> 01:10:35,780
you know,

1223
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:40,670
these conservative say some pretty wacky
shit and then people want to fire them.

1224
01:10:40,671 --> 01:10:44,930
I don't get that. Like, I'd rather prove
you wrong. Then actually make you go away.

1225
01:10:44,931 --> 01:10:48,410
Like the guy who used to book David
Letterman Show, who said women,

1226
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:52,680
the Midwest doesn't think women are,
are funny. That's a Ed, right? Yeah.

1227
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:57,430
Uh, who is it? What is that? I
forget his name, but it, oh my God.

1228
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:03,610
Can't remember his name. But he got to
think he got fired from that position.

1229
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:08,560
But you shouldn't fire him because he
stating something that he feels he's

1230
01:11:08,561 --> 01:11:09,970
learned over a certain amount of time.

1231
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:13,560
So what should they showed
him that he was wrong? Um,

1232
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:17,370
women are funny and if you think
that you should have shown him,

1233
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:21,330
making him go away doesn't
change. Eddie, Eddie, Eddie Brill,

1234
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:24,960
and he brill doesn't hate when
that happens. My brain sucks.

1235
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:28,150
That's where I'm saying to
take Alpha ran today. Yeah.

1236
01:11:28,151 --> 01:11:30,210
If your brain is broken down,

1237
01:11:30,211 --> 01:11:32,580
I wonder if Alpha brain and
we'd just cancel each other.

1238
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:37,510
No, not to me. No. No.
I definitely have a,

1239
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,420
an impact whether I take it,
I don't take it.

1240
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:44,650
Cause you remember, do you remember when
you first started smoking weed and, uh,

1241
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:48,460
the next morning you'd wake up and
you're like, wow, man, I'm my head.

1242
01:11:48,461 --> 01:11:50,290
I'm still fucked up from that.
We,

1243
01:11:50,291 --> 01:11:53,940
last night I flew foggy and then
that just kind of went away.

1244
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:58,650
No, I mean I think everybody's body
processes things differently. You know,

1245
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:02,090
my body's always processed.
We'd where for whatever reason,

1246
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:03,570
the next day I was fine. Really? Yeah,

1247
01:12:03,571 --> 01:12:06,270
I'm fine in a few hours my body
goes through a pretty quick.

1248
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:10,030
I remember I used to be a big thing when
I first started smoking weed and how it

1249
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:14,430
like almost lasted they the next day
where I felt my brain just not being as

1250
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:15,264
clear.

1251
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:19,500
People don't know how deep we go
sometimes too. Sometimes we get so high,

1252
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:22,710
it's just Dunkin and I. The other day
we talked about it on his podcast,

1253
01:12:22,711 --> 01:12:25,500
we had a great podcast that we did
together. The Duncan Trussell family hour.

1254
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:29,470
You get a download it from, you can find
it, go online and figure it out. UH,

1255
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:33,600
T R U s s e l l,
but we got Super Bazooka,

1256
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:37,640
Bazooka Ud, and then we went to Costco
and it was my first time going to

1257
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,510
[inaudible]. Have you ever been to
any kind of thing like that before?

1258
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:41,590
I don't think I had,

1259
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,640
I don't think I had, I might've been to
something that long, long, long time ago.

1260
01:12:45,641 --> 01:12:48,490
And it didn't mean anything to me because
I was probably sober when I was there.

1261
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:51,650
But to go through high was like,

1262
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:55,330
we were totally fear and loathing in
Las Vegas and get him and I were like,

1263
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:59,350
weird shit. Oh, we were so
baked with, isn't it? We had
no business out in public,

1264
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:04,080
no business cause we, uh, we're about
to do a podcast together and uh,

1265
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,090
we were,
first of all,

1266
01:13:05,091 --> 01:13:09,100
I was very happy because Dunkin and
Brian had finally made up and all this

1267
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:13,780
craziness of two of my best
friends, uh, at war with each other.

1268
01:13:13,781 --> 01:13:17,350
It was fucking nonsense. And it lasted
for so long. It was really stressful. But,

1269
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:19,750
uh, thankfully it all worked out
and so we were super psyched.

1270
01:13:19,751 --> 01:13:23,440
So we just got deep, deep,
deep, deep, deep into the
hole. We just kept going at it.

1271
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:26,740
We kept killing this joint and they
were like, oh my God, we're too high.

1272
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:27,650
We're too high.

1273
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:30,550
We walked down to the Costco and I
forget what we were trying to get. Oh,

1274
01:13:30,551 --> 01:13:34,000
you have 82 paper towels in your
car? No, I didn't get anything. Well,

1275
01:13:34,001 --> 01:13:36,280
you know why we didn't get anything
because that's what happened.

1276
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:41,370
We went down there to get a grill
and they don't sell grills will after

1277
01:13:42,701 --> 01:13:47,140
September it was 110 fucking
degrees outside after
September. And they were like,

1278
01:13:47,230 --> 01:13:49,570
well that's a seasonal item.
I go, Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

1279
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:53,800
Fucking barbecue grill is seasonal
in la when it's always warm.

1280
01:13:54,970 --> 01:13:59,710
I use my grill year round.
I love barbecuing.

1281
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:03,040
I think like barbecuing steak
on the grill. It for me,

1282
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:06,340
it lights up some caveman shit
that I have for, you know,

1283
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:10,480
they say dudes have like neanderthal
in them for, I got champion me, dude.

1284
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:12,430
I have some DNA

1285
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:15,910
that came from the first champ that
figured out how to start a fire by banging

1286
01:14:15,911 --> 01:14:19,780
rocks together. And so I good
dude, I can't take that shit.

1287
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:22,180
And when I uh,

1288
01:14:22,181 --> 01:14:27,070
when I get like a primal satisfaction
over like grilling steaks,

1289
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:30,250
like it's, so it's a creepy
thing. Blood pumping. Like,

1290
01:14:30,251 --> 01:14:32,990
if anybody else in my family wanted
to cook the steaks, I be like,

1291
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:37,030
fuck is wrong with you. Back the
fuck off. My crazy. Are you crazy?

1292
01:14:37,031 --> 01:14:39,190
You don't know how to fucking
cook a steak on a grill.

1293
01:14:39,191 --> 01:14:43,660
You're going to fuck this experience up.
I got it down where I have an iPhone,

1294
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:48,940
a s a stopwatch thing and know
exactly how long I know exactly.

1295
01:14:48,941 --> 01:14:53,700
I know how many I use these
little charcoal chimneys.
You ever seen those things?

1296
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:57,400
Well the um, you know, when
you get let go a Weber grill,

1297
01:14:57,490 --> 01:15:00,490
you know those Weber grills is all
you need. But those Weber grills,

1298
01:15:00,491 --> 01:15:01,750
they also sell these Webber,

1299
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:05,420
charcoal chimneys and you
stuffed like some ripped up, uh,

1300
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:07,340
like a trash bag or something.
Oh,

1301
01:15:07,341 --> 01:15:10,960
well some paper on the bottom it looks
like a flour sifter. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1302
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:14,260
And then you pour the charcoal in it and
light a fire on the bottom and it cooks

1303
01:15:14,261 --> 01:15:16,660
it all the way through the tops
of the coals or like white hot.

1304
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:20,110
You lay those pitches down and
know exactly how high the grill is.

1305
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:23,000
And I let it sit on that grill
for five minutes. I let that grow,

1306
01:15:23,001 --> 01:15:28,001
get stupid hot and then I know exactly
how much the time based on how thick the

1307
01:15:28,031 --> 01:15:30,820
steak is based on how much it's,
how much.

1308
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:33,810
What's your favorite steak?
Because I,

1309
01:15:33,811 --> 01:15:36,490
I hear Bobby flay and then
I just went with the, uh,

1310
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:40,420
what's the one that has to fillet and
the other state together to help for

1311
01:15:40,421 --> 01:15:43,480
health reasons and tastes reasons.
There's two different, I have to say,

1312
01:15:43,481 --> 01:15:46,840
it's two different things I like.
I love the taste of grass fed rib eyes.

1313
01:15:46,841 --> 01:15:51,130
It's a different taste.
It's more meaty or a more gamey rather.

1314
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:54,160
It's almost like a buffalo or a like,
it's a weird,

1315
01:15:54,161 --> 01:15:58,450
it's more a game animal because what we
don't realize is that we're feeding cows

1316
01:15:58,451 --> 01:16:01,750
shit they're not supposed to be at.
That's why I just, I don't know man.

1317
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:04,960
I know you gave me shit about one
become a vegetarian and I don't,

1318
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:08,620
but I just don't like the way
we're raising animals right now.

1319
01:16:08,621 --> 01:16:12,100
It just doesn't seem, I agree.
Well, you can raise them grass fed,

1320
01:16:12,101 --> 01:16:13,960
you can buy grass fed meat.
And we're actually,

1321
01:16:13,961 --> 01:16:17,440
we're having a guy in on the
podcast a in the future, uh,

1322
01:16:17,441 --> 01:16:21,640
the guy from the who who wrote the
bulletproof executive, uh, Dave Asprey,

1323
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:26,470
he's coming on the podcast soon and he's
going to explain all of this shit for

1324
01:16:26,471 --> 01:16:30,780
us. And, uh, that's a, that's
a, that's much needed because a,

1325
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:34,490
I don't understand like what, you
know, how how much of an effect, uh,

1326
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:37,450
grass fed meat has on you
as opposed to corn fed.

1327
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:40,220
But apparently it's pretty fucking
Substan I'm sure it is. Yeah.

1328
01:16:40,270 --> 01:16:44,560
Apparently it's substantial,
not just with the meat but with the milk.

1329
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:47,710
If you drink milk from
grass fed animal and a,

1330
01:16:47,711 --> 01:16:52,120
and even a cheese and butter from, uh,
from grass fed cows is better for you,

1331
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:56,050
which is really kind of nuts. But
the corn, uh, in this country,

1332
01:16:56,051 --> 01:16:59,500
corn is a gigantic crop and they
try to use it for everything.

1333
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:02,800
Everything now and the price
of corn is skyrocketed.

1334
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:08,010
But also people like the way corn fed
beef tastes because it gets so fatty.

1335
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,570
You. There is really an argument
for the how delicious, uh,

1336
01:17:11,571 --> 01:17:14,690
corn fed rib eye is because
they're fucking substantial.

1337
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:19,870
You get a fast corn fed ribeye and
cook it over some mesquite wood.

1338
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:23,480
Oh son.
Big uh,

1339
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:26,600
big griller is Michael favor men.
Oh,

1340
01:17:26,601 --> 01:17:31,370
my shaman is a chef's amazing
mother fucker Bro. Yeah,

1341
01:17:31,371 --> 01:17:34,470
he's a bad motherfucker. Some of the best
steak I've had in awhile as his stake.

1342
01:17:34,570 --> 01:17:37,300
Yeah. Favorite mins. A bad motherfucker.
We, we've talked about, uh,

1343
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:41,730
him like we should have an event here and
have him cook here. All that would be,

1344
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:45,320
that'd be fucking bad ass man.
That'd be totally bad ass.

1345
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:49,280
And he could do stand up to
hold the grill. He's going
to do 10 minutes. He's got,

1346
01:17:49,281 --> 01:17:52,050
if he's done a podcast, I know he's
looking to do something. We should be,

1347
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:57,200
he should ask casking show. No cooking
guys like Faber and faber mins. Uh, guys,

1348
01:17:57,201 --> 01:18:01,700
guys, big meaty motherfucker. And
he's fast too. He's really funny.

1349
01:18:01,701 --> 01:18:04,580
So that's one of my favorite people
to gigs with. So he's a great guy.

1350
01:18:04,581 --> 01:18:08,380
He's a fun guy to talk to too. He has
crazy fees. Old Score comedy store.

1351
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:12,080
He's been around there forever. Yeah.
We've known favor men since the,

1352
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:14,130
it was the 90s, I think. First met fame,

1353
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:18,560
wasn't it like eight days working a lot
when I got picked up and that was about

1354
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:22,700
99. Well we went to his
place after September 11th.

1355
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:26,390
We were watching all the shit go
down on TV from favorites house.

1356
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:30,460
I got pictures of me and Diaz
and Ralphie May and yeah, we were

1357
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:34,610
baked.
Baked is fuck hanging out of favor.

1358
01:18:34,611 --> 01:18:37,710
Brent's place watching the guys
who were high as fuck. Ugh,

1359
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:42,500
ag lasted well. That was,
um, she got a high back then.

1360
01:18:42,501 --> 01:18:44,470
I didn't know you got high that long ago.
Yeah,

1361
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:47,120
I was going to say that was about a
year after I started smoking weed.

1362
01:18:47,121 --> 01:18:51,950
I started smoking weed at 2000. I
remember that too. Yeah. Round 2099,

1363
01:18:51,951 --> 01:18:56,010
maybe 99, 2000, somewhere
around then. And then, um,

1364
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:59,630
right after that, September 11th
happened. So maybe it was my fault, man.

1365
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:02,780
I fucked reality up with my thinking man.

1366
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,400
After right around
September 9th I started,

1367
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:09,020
I just can't watch television
because everything's just a wreck.

1368
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:14,090
Reenactment of that crazy ass shit
was um, those attacks on the, um,

1369
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:17,900
the American embassies. What Day did
those take place? September 11th date for.

1370
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:21,320
So they did it. They did it like on
purpose symbolically on that day.

1371
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:25,430
That guy who put out that video. I mean
there's so much bullshit with that video.

1372
01:19:25,431 --> 01:19:25,911
First of all,

1373
01:19:25,911 --> 01:19:28,940
it looks to explain what you're talking
about for people to love them. Video. Ah,

1374
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,840
innocence of Muslims that came out.
Yeah, I think it's, it's on youtube.

1375
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:37,880
It's so poorly done and
it's like everybody's in
blackface or this is more brown

1376
01:19:37,881 --> 01:19:41,630
face cause they're playing Muslims.
It's so stupid.

1377
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:46,080
Like I can't believe that people went
back crazy over something that dump,

1378
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:50,360
like give, if Steven Spielberg came out
with something that was well executed,

1379
01:19:50,361 --> 01:19:54,380
I can understand why. So we would go,
no, I really can't even understand that.

1380
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:59,120
But I can understand if it was done
well, this is so poorly done. You know,

1381
01:19:59,121 --> 01:20:02,690
there's the really crazy,
uh, I shouldn't say crazy,

1382
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:06,830
but conspiracy inclined folks
think this is a CIA job.

1383
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,300
And they think that the CIA

1384
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:12,030
is doing this to a rally up these,
uh,

1385
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:16,380
American enemies so that we're forced
to go to a war against Muslim countries

1386
01:20:16,381 --> 01:20:21,260
and we can justify a war against
Iran or, or anybody else. And uh,

1387
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:25,230
that, that that's the reason
why they think this thing
got so popular so quickly.

1388
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:27,780
Because before I even
knew about this film,

1389
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,820
they were already bombing us embassies.

1390
01:20:29,821 --> 01:20:33,270
Like they just immediately went
to rocket attacks. And I was like,

1391
01:20:33,271 --> 01:20:34,710
how did they find out about it?
I mean,

1392
01:20:34,711 --> 01:20:36,630
what kind of Twitter account
did they have? You know,

1393
01:20:36,631 --> 01:20:39,810
I have 800,000 people on my
Twitter account and I didn't
find out about it until

1394
01:20:39,811 --> 01:20:43,330
someone shot a rocket into an embassy.
You know, how are these people, how,

1395
01:20:43,331 --> 01:20:46,080
how was that information
distributed so quickly?

1396
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:49,860
And then how is this organized so
quickly where people just immediately are

1397
01:20:49,861 --> 01:20:53,280
protesting it? Like you've all seen it.
Yeah. You all got together and saw it.

1398
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:58,890
I'm not sure that that's how viral that
video was. It seems to me like, man,

1399
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,170
if I wanted to,

1400
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:03,660
to look at the past of like some
of the shit that America has done,

1401
01:21:03,661 --> 01:21:06,700
like the Gulf of Tonkin incident and all
the different things that we've done to

1402
01:21:06,701 --> 01:21:10,650
try to get us into war.
And I understand that that's happened.

1403
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:14,490
That has happened. It's fact.
There's no getting around it.

1404
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:17,910
It's a hundred percent fact. The Bay
of pigs, that's a fact too. You know,

1405
01:21:17,911 --> 01:21:20,100
the Northwood operation,
Northwoods, that's a fact.

1406
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:23,160
There's a lot of crazy
facts about like about war.

1407
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:27,510
So if you want it to really
piss off Muslims and get
them to do something stupid,

1408
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:31,260
what's really ridiculous as all you have
to do is make a depiction of their guy,

1409
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:33,420
make a depiction of
this Muhammad character.

1410
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:37,890
And you could do it as a CIA cycop cyop
or you know, whatever they call it.

1411
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:41,460
The one of the woman who was on
the show and actress Cindy Lee,

1412
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:46,470
she claims that her voice was
dubbed and she says that, um, uh,

1413
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:49,620
who she has a role in the controversial
low budget film titled The innocence of

1414
01:21:49,621 --> 01:21:53,130
Muslims, which has sparked riots against
the u s in the Middle East. I mean,

1415
01:21:53,131 --> 01:21:55,500
this is like some shit
out of a fucking movie.

1416
01:21:55,650 --> 01:22:00,150
This movie is some shit out of a movie.
And she's saying, she says, yeah, exactly.

1417
01:22:00,151 --> 01:22:03,360
The act, the act more than that,
more, more crazy than that.

1418
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:07,290
The actors were deceived.
A Garcia told the Hollywood reporter,

1419
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:10,770
my voice was dubbed and I wasn't,
it wasn't even my voice.

1420
01:22:10,771 --> 01:22:13,620
I had no idea he did that
until the trailer came out.

1421
01:22:13,770 --> 01:22:17,790
My only part was the role of a mother
talking to her husband, her daughter,

1422
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:21,300
and this man named master
George in the film. Uh,

1423
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:26,250
Garcia plays the mother of a 12 year
old girl who is set to marry the Prophet

1424
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:30,330
Muhammad. Whoa. Garcia is
heard. Insulting Mohammed,

1425
01:22:30,331 --> 01:22:34,530
asking her husband if Muhammad
was a child molester because uh,

1426
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:38,730
her daughter is but a child
and he's 55 years old. Wow,

1427
01:22:38,731 --> 01:22:43,160
this is crazy. So they put all
that into her mouth after it was.

1428
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:47,220
This is, it's very possible
that this is like some CIA shit,

1429
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:51,930
a lot of money trying to just trying to
rile these motherfuckers up to give us

1430
01:22:51,931 --> 01:22:54,900
an excuse to start going in there.
And this is how it starts.

1431
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:58,230
Rocket attacks on embassies is step one.

1432
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:03,540
It's a real weird to listen to General
Wesley Clark talk about all this stuff in

1433
01:23:04,351 --> 01:23:09,010
like 2000 and it was 2004
or 2008 he basically,

1434
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:10,390
Brian can you pull that up please?

1435
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:15,930
A General Wesley Clark predicts a u s tax.

1436
01:23:16,751 --> 01:23:18,520
Maybe. I can't believe that. You know,

1437
01:23:18,521 --> 01:23:22,230
we got to stop calling it military defense
and just start calling military off

1438
01:23:22,231 --> 01:23:24,250
fence cause that's what
it seems to be now.

1439
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:29,230
We're just always on the offensive man
and it never seems to work out. Yeah.

1440
01:23:29,231 --> 01:23:32,470
The plan.
Look up General Wesley Clark and it says,

1441
01:23:32,471 --> 01:23:36,580
reveals US plan to
invade Iraq and this guy,

1442
01:23:36,581 --> 01:23:39,700
I forget what year this was,
that he uh, did this interview,

1443
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:44,260
but he basically outlines everything
that's happening today. Okay.

1444
01:23:44,261 --> 01:23:47,740
It was 2007 he outlined this,
join me,

1445
01:23:47,741 --> 01:23:51,490
better me and join me in more this,
enjoy this big

1446
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:57,650
jerk off this lotions are sponsoring
this very important message.

1447
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:01,350
Jerk off. Lotions are so
critical to a good masturbate.

1448
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:06,430
It's this here. No, no, no. You got,
you're watching movies on general.

1449
01:24:06,431 --> 01:24:08,910
Wesley Clark reveals US plan.
If you just,

1450
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:13,180
just type general and Clark and
youtube. Yeah, that's exactly it.

1451
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:15,700
And democracy now hit the,
hit the volume. He says,

1452
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:20,210
we've made the decision. We're
going to war with Iraq. Oh,

1453
01:24:20,211 --> 01:24:24,710
I came back to see him a few weeks later
and by that time we were bombing in

1454
01:24:24,711 --> 01:24:27,560
Afghanistan. I said, are we still going
to war with Iraq? And he said, oh,

1455
01:24:27,561 --> 01:24:30,710
it's worse than that.
He said he reached over on his desk.

1456
01:24:30,711 --> 01:24:33,260
He picked up a piece of paper.
He said, I just, he said,

1457
01:24:33,261 --> 01:24:36,740
I just got this down from upstairs
mean separate events office today.

1458
01:24:36,741 --> 01:24:37,460
And he said,

1459
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:42,140
this is a memo that describes how we're
going to take out seven countries in

1460
01:24:42,141 --> 01:24:46,640
five years starting with Iraq
and in Syria, Lebanon, Libya,

1461
01:24:46,641 --> 01:24:49,310
Somalia,
Sudan and finishing off Iran

1462
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:53,820
is, and there's no, you
wrap your heads around that.

1463
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:55,860
Wrap your heads around that.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1464
01:24:56,610 --> 01:25:01,610
this is General Wesley Clark in 2007
describing the u s plan to invade Iraq,

1465
01:25:03,061 --> 01:25:05,250
Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia,

1466
01:25:05,251 --> 01:25:10,180
Sudan and I ran and that these are all
areas where shit is going down. Um,

1467
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:14,790
especially like what just happened
in Libya. Look what's going on.

1468
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:17,790
I mean that's where the a US
embassy was bombed as in Libya.

1469
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:21,690
Somalia is of course a hotbed of piracy.

1470
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:26,700
There's always some crazy shit going
on in Somalia, which by the way, uh,

1471
01:25:26,701 --> 01:25:29,130
I don't necessarily blame
the Somalians at all.

1472
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:33,850
If you go and look up their history and
look up what they call the volunteers,

1473
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:38,400
what do they call the
voluntary coast guard of Somalia?

1474
01:25:38,401 --> 01:25:39,570
I think that's what they call themselves.

1475
01:25:39,870 --> 01:25:44,100
They started kidnapping people because
they were kidnapping European ships who

1476
01:25:44,101 --> 01:25:45,990
are dumping poison.
It's their waters.

1477
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:49,320
Their waters were completely polluted
and they are like a fishing culture.

1478
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,180
And so they started going out
and kidnapping these Europeans.

1479
01:25:54,330 --> 01:25:57,280
But then it became like much
more profitable to kidnap people.

1480
01:25:57,281 --> 01:26:00,570
Then it was to fish because they fucking
polluted the shit out of that water.

1481
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:04,250
They dump toxic waste right off their
ocean. It's just the fishing population

1482
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:06,620
that's just horrible.
Yeah, it's crazy shit.

1483
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:10,130
So these people really
went full on Desperado.

1484
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:11,900
Like it was created by greed.

1485
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:15,080
The Somalian problem was created by
green and that seems to be the biggest

1486
01:26:15,081 --> 01:26:17,990
problem with a lot of
the decisions be made.

1487
01:26:18,010 --> 01:26:22,310
One thing that scares me about the
military right now and is that how many

1488
01:26:22,311 --> 01:26:26,670
people are in charge of the military
that never were in the military? Right.

1489
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:30,110
You know, it's chicken.
It's very easy to be like,

1490
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:34,160
you know the talk game about punching
people in the face if you've never been

1491
01:26:34,161 --> 01:26:37,220
punched in the face, you know, it's
like if you've been punched in the face,

1492
01:26:37,221 --> 01:26:41,270
you think twice about starting a fight.
Cause you know the air hurts, right?

1493
01:26:41,271 --> 01:26:43,460
And you know what you can do to
somebody if you know how to fight.

1494
01:26:43,461 --> 01:26:45,320
And you know when you can do to somebody
and you don't want someone doing that

1495
01:26:45,321 --> 01:26:47,690
to you. You know, you're
like, whoa Nelly, you know,

1496
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:51,170
I had a conversation with a dude is like,
ah, I could have kicked that guy's a,

1497
01:26:51,171 --> 01:26:52,790
you know, he's talking shit. I
could have kicked his ass. I'm like,

1498
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,140
how do you know he could
have kicked his ass?

1499
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:55,610
You don't know anything about that guy.

1500
01:26:55,611 --> 01:26:59,420
I know some little dudes that
can fuck you up. You know?

1501
01:26:59,421 --> 01:27:03,590
And people who run around thinking that
they could just get in fights, fights,

1502
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:07,100
fights are fucking terrible.
It's never a good thing to get in a fight.

1503
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:10,790
I think this is the first election
ever were both guys running for the

1504
01:27:10,791 --> 01:27:14,870
presidency. I think neither
don't have military backgrounds.

1505
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:18,950
And I think that's like such
an interesting thing that
you're putting the guy in

1506
01:27:18,951 --> 01:27:23,600
charge of the military that's never
actually had any military experience.

1507
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,580
That's interesting.
Is that the case?

1508
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:30,820
Well currently than Clinton went
against George Bush senior military.

1509
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:35,550
Well he was CIA and yeah,
he was military World War Two flu.

1510
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,570
Yeah. I mean, but he was
a, not just military,

1511
01:27:38,571 --> 01:27:41,890
he was actually a part of the intelligence
community and the head of the CIA,

1512
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:45,740
Reagan was military. What was I
saying? He, I think he flew to, or he,

1513
01:27:45,741 --> 01:27:50,741
I know he was something in the military
and of course George Bush Jr was like

1514
01:27:50,841 --> 01:27:54,750
all the craziness of it is national
guard. Cub Scouts. Yeah. He went,

1515
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:59,920
he went fishing once. He was in a
weird situation. But then again, um,

1516
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:03,050
well who was the opposing
McCain? Yeah. Mccain.

1517
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:06,740
Mccain was running for president and
he was obviously a war hero. Yeah.

1518
01:28:06,741 --> 01:28:07,521
It's kind of interesting.

1519
01:28:07,521 --> 01:28:12,110
These are the first two guys against a
guy who married the ketchup Eris who was

1520
01:28:12,111 --> 01:28:16,190
the guy, uh, that they actually
somehow made him look bad. Uh,

1521
01:28:16,191 --> 01:28:19,700
who was the guy that Bush
ran against the, uh, second,

1522
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:24,360
first term was Al Gore. Second
Term John Kerry. John Kerry. Oh,

1523
01:28:24,390 --> 01:28:27,100
did you say, I thought you said
John McKay my bad? No, no, no.

1524
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:30,920
I said Mccain was the guy who,
uh, Obama went again. Yeah.

1525
01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:34,640
So I think this is the first time
we've had two guys who have no military

1526
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:38,690
background at all. Yeah, no, I think
you're right. John Kerry was a military.

1527
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:42,830
Obviously the whole swiftboat
thing was ridiculous. Won't carry,

1528
01:28:42,831 --> 01:28:44,470
probably should have won.
You know,

1529
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,550
who knows how much fuckery
was going on with that.

1530
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:51,080
Go go watch on TV or on Youtube.
Go look up hacking democracy.

1531
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:54,260
It's one of the craziest documentaries
I've ever seen about those voting

1532
01:28:54,261 --> 01:28:56,510
machines and how easily
they could change the votes.

1533
01:28:56,750 --> 01:29:01,220
And I don't understand why people don't
think that this is at all possible.

1534
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:05,250
Come on when that much money is at stake,
people do some shady shit.

1535
01:29:05,251 --> 01:29:06,570
There's so much money at stake,

1536
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:09,900
we can't even wrap our head around it
and people become addicted to all this

1537
01:29:09,901 --> 01:29:12,710
money. It's just like I was talking
about earlier with Shane Smith, the,

1538
01:29:12,730 --> 01:29:14,260
the idea that the, uh, the,

1539
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:18,180
the whole criminal system is a,

1540
01:29:18,181 --> 01:29:19,980
a profitable system for a lot of people.

1541
01:29:19,981 --> 01:29:22,650
There's a lot of people who get contracts,
you know,

1542
01:29:22,651 --> 01:29:25,020
for us to hire new security guards.

1543
01:29:25,021 --> 01:29:28,710
And there's a lot of people that run
private prisons in California, everywhere,

1544
01:29:28,711 --> 01:29:33,150
man, everywhere. This is look, this
jobs to be had in keeping drugs illegal.

1545
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:35,580
The real thing is you just
got to figure out how to,

1546
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:40,020
how to make something that replaces
those jobs with something that's actually

1547
01:29:40,021 --> 01:29:43,200
good for people instead of
arresting kids for pot. You know,

1548
01:29:43,201 --> 01:29:46,800
there's gotta be a way to do that where
you're figuring out how to use all these

1549
01:29:46,801 --> 01:29:49,140
people and you don't,
you don't take them out of work.

1550
01:29:49,141 --> 01:29:54,030
He just give them something productive
to do instead of being fucking crazy. Uh,

1551
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:56,850
you know, anti-drug Crusaders. I mean,

1552
01:29:58,110 --> 01:30:00,810
the whole thing about these
stabilizing regions too,

1553
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:03,510
you see that going on right now in Mexico.

1554
01:30:03,511 --> 01:30:07,740
Like we are de stabilizing that
whole area for whatever reason.

1555
01:30:07,741 --> 01:30:11,710
I don't know either cheap labor or lower,
there's this whole, you ever hear the,

1556
01:30:11,711 --> 01:30:15,750
the marrow, that whole conspiracy
theory about trying to turn like Canada,

1557
01:30:15,751 --> 01:30:20,480
America and Mexico into one kind of one,
I don't know.

1558
01:30:20,481 --> 01:30:24,060
Groups so that they all have
the same denomination. Yeah.

1559
01:30:24,061 --> 01:30:26,460
It didn't someone talk about that on CNN.
Yeah.

1560
01:30:26,461 --> 01:30:30,000
And then they were talking about
how they did that with the euro,

1561
01:30:30,001 --> 01:30:31,380
but it's crumbling.

1562
01:30:31,381 --> 01:30:35,130
The euro right now it's like cause all
the different countries at different

1563
01:30:35,131 --> 01:30:37,950
economic schemes going on and they
can all support each other and it's,

1564
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:39,630
it's just really interesting.

1565
01:30:39,631 --> 01:30:42,860
But there's that whole saying
that they're trying to, you know,

1566
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:47,900
make Mexico so poor that they need us to
join in and then we make everybody like

1567
01:30:48,301 --> 01:30:49,770
the marrow.
It's like this whole,

1568
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:53,850
and then when you do that you get rid of
the US Constitution. That's the whole,

1569
01:30:53,851 --> 01:30:57,090
that whole conspiracy theory
about that. Yeah, it was,

1570
01:30:57,091 --> 01:31:00,630
Jack wasn't a Jack Cafferty who was
on CNN who actually brought up that.

1571
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:04,620
But I think that's proven to be
like Obama actually addressed that.

1572
01:31:04,621 --> 01:31:07,620
And running for president. He said
there's no evidence of that. Well,

1573
01:31:07,650 --> 01:31:10,770
that's what he's going to sell. Well, I
mean, do you really think that they're,

1574
01:31:10,771 --> 01:31:13,050
they're destabilizing Mexico on purpose.

1575
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:15,960
Do you think that that's what's going
on and that the idea is to just combine

1576
01:31:15,961 --> 01:31:16,770
everything,

1577
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:20,550
destabilize it so we have a reason to
combine with it and then just take it over

1578
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:24,630
really a whole bunch of theories about
that one. Yeah. But the stabilizing,

1579
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:28,240
it's easier to, you know, it's easier to
deal with something when you're paying.

1580
01:31:28,370 --> 01:31:33,260
If you're saying that these
drug cartels or have us, us, uh,

1581
01:31:33,261 --> 01:31:34,680
our firearms,

1582
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:39,300
it's easier to pay off the cartel than
it needs to pay off an entire Mexican

1583
01:31:39,301 --> 01:31:41,160
government. Do you understand
what I'm saying? Yes.

1584
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:44,910
It's much easier to pay off one guy
then pay off a whole group of people.

1585
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:49,740
Yeah. Yeah. It's, it, the whole
thing is very interesting.

1586
01:31:49,741 --> 01:31:51,480
And if that's really how
they've organized it,

1587
01:31:51,481 --> 01:31:53,520
that they've decided
to d stabilize Mexico,

1588
01:31:53,521 --> 01:31:56,180
what are they going to do to Canada and
get them to join because the Canada's

1589
01:31:56,310 --> 01:32:00,160
economy's great. The people were fucking
coolest shit. They're the, you know,

1590
01:32:00,161 --> 01:32:03,730
like how are they gonna how are we going
to make them hop on the Amiro the only

1591
01:32:03,731 --> 01:32:06,850
thing that could make this as
Canadians are so god damn agreeable,

1592
01:32:06,851 --> 01:32:09,340
they might just join up anyway.
Alrighty.

1593
01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:13,000
Where I guess we all have the same money.
Canada is phenomenal.

1594
01:32:13,001 --> 01:32:14,650
I'm very excited about
going there this week.

1595
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:17,270
We're going to have a good time
at Toronto this week and uh, I'm,

1596
01:32:17,271 --> 01:32:18,290
I'm really sorry.
I've,

1597
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:21,910
I keep hearing all these stories about
people that are trying to buy tickets and

1598
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:23,490
then they buy them online.
Uh,

1599
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:26,500
the only ones that are available are
from these disreputable places that are

1600
01:32:26,501 --> 01:32:30,930
charging like a stupid stupid amounts of
money. I got no control over that folks.

1601
01:32:30,970 --> 01:32:32,260
I'm really sorry to hear about it.

1602
01:32:32,290 --> 01:32:35,710
There's certain venues where you
can kind of make different deals,

1603
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:40,350
but a lot of venues including great ones
like Massey Hall, they, they have, um,

1604
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:44,270
they have it set up online and people can
just buy the tickets and then they can

1605
01:32:44,271 --> 01:32:46,090
just sell them and there's
nothing anybody can do about it.

1606
01:32:46,091 --> 01:32:48,640
I don't know how he could stop people
from buying the tickets and then trying to

1607
01:32:48,641 --> 01:32:51,970
resell them at a higher, uh,
face of scalping. Yeah, scalp.

1608
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,520
It's essentially like a leader
in herself. Scalping. I mean,

1609
01:32:54,521 --> 01:32:55,354
I don't know how they do it,

1610
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,670
but they charged stupid amounts
of money for the tickets.

1611
01:32:58,030 --> 01:32:59,470
I have nothing to do with that though,
folks.

1612
01:32:59,470 --> 01:33:02,680
I'm sorry Louis C K is
doing something different.

1613
01:33:02,681 --> 01:33:06,760
Hash only you have to run to the
comedy club and, and pay for cash.

1614
01:33:06,761 --> 01:33:09,730
That's how he did it.
He just said that's at the comedy store.

1615
01:33:09,731 --> 01:33:12,730
But I think other places he's allowing
people to buy tickets with credit cards.

1616
01:33:13,090 --> 01:33:14,620
But you,
you will,

1617
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:18,130
he can only use certain venues that
don't have deals and he's trying to like

1618
01:33:18,131 --> 01:33:22,330
figure out how to do it where it's
going. Pearl Jam. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1619
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:25,630
I guess I'm somewhere on that.
But you can't do anything
he wants, you know. Yeah.

1620
01:33:25,631 --> 01:33:27,580
I mean he sold out the comedy store,

1621
01:33:27,670 --> 01:33:32,530
which has 400 seats in like 20 minutes.
And did he do it off of Twitter?

1622
01:33:32,531 --> 01:33:34,420
Like how did people know that he
was doing it? He just said, hey,

1623
01:33:34,421 --> 01:33:38,080
I'm going to be at the comedy store. Yeah,
he's not in town. They're very often,

1624
01:33:38,081 --> 01:33:40,510
so when he's in, you know,
in town, it's a big deal.

1625
01:33:40,690 --> 01:33:44,140
It's so good to see that La Salle has a
great comedy scene like that. You know,

1626
01:33:44,141 --> 01:33:48,280
that people are enjoying comedy enough
that there's a big enough group of people

1627
01:33:48,281 --> 01:33:50,470
that they can just
immediately hear about that.

1628
01:33:50,471 --> 01:33:53,290
And everybody like runs out cause those
are probably like comedy fans, you know,

1629
01:33:53,291 --> 01:33:57,130
seals come right out here. There's
like, like when I moved out here,

1630
01:33:57,131 --> 01:34:01,810
it was like 99,
I think there was like three comedy clubs.

1631
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:05,210
Now. There's like five or
six comedy clubs. Yeah.

1632
01:34:05,230 --> 01:34:07,450
There's all these new ones
too that have popped up.

1633
01:34:07,451 --> 01:34:10,730
And there's so many like peripheral
clubs, like the Irvine Improv, the Bray.

1634
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:14,210
I did Breyer last night with Collin. I'll
let you go down. There was headlining.

1635
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:17,500
It popped in fucking hilarious man.
He was great. It was really funny.

1636
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:20,800
And that's a great improv too. And
then of course, the ice house. Oh,

1637
01:34:20,801 --> 01:34:25,090
we have a show this, um, this Wednesday
night at the ice house. And, uh,

1638
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:29,200
it's a fucking stacked lineup. Ladies and
gentleman, this is one of our best ones.

1639
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:32,020
Uh,
were doing these as often as possible.

1640
01:34:32,021 --> 01:34:36,940
We're trying to do these fucking things,
uh, if not every week real close to him.

1641
01:34:37,150 --> 01:34:40,960
And for us it's like an opportunity to
fuck around to work on new material.

1642
01:34:40,961 --> 01:34:44,920
And so you get a lot of guys
who are stretching out and
just fucking around and,

1643
01:34:44,921 --> 01:34:49,120
and, and we also do a podcast
simultaneously that you could download.

1644
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:53,410
It's only available off of the desk
squad network, which is on iTunes.

1645
01:34:53,510 --> 01:34:55,640
Are you guys selling tickets
off that? No, no, no.

1646
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:57,860
We're selling tickets here at
the ice house. The Ice House

1647
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:01,940
takes it, but it's Dom Irrera,
uh, Doug Benson, Joey Diaz,

1648
01:35:01,941 --> 01:35:05,320
Duncan Trussell. Um, and Oh,

1649
01:35:05,330 --> 01:35:09,710
Greg Fitzsimmons I as a good line and
maybe Thompson girl, he might come down.

1650
01:35:09,711 --> 01:35:13,040
He told me it's a phenomenal line and
we're trying to do these as often as we

1651
01:35:13,041 --> 01:35:17,340
can. And uh, it's 15 bucks and the
fucking show sick. And you know,

1652
01:35:17,341 --> 01:35:19,880
it goes on forever.
I think death squad shows are great,

1653
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,530
but like it's hard for me
to do new material there
cause it always crushes cause

1654
01:35:24,531 --> 01:35:27,860
you know they listened to the podcast
and then like I have to take it somewhere

1655
01:35:27,861 --> 01:35:31,580
else and try and crowd that doesn't listen
to a podcast or doesn't know anything

1656
01:35:31,581 --> 01:35:34,730
about that squad because
there's such phenomenal crowds.

1657
01:35:34,731 --> 01:35:38,870
They're like always so hot. And then I
do a joke and I'm like, oh that crushed.

1658
01:35:38,871 --> 01:35:42,560
And then I go somewhere where maybe
they don't know my podcast and then just

1659
01:35:42,561 --> 01:35:45,170
like, okay it did not get
the refill. It's also,

1660
01:35:45,171 --> 01:35:49,040
they don't know you're his personality.
So he's saying all this twisted shit.

1661
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:52,610
Yeah. What's the little fuck
is this crazy Armenian asshole,

1662
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:56,910
but you're up there just slinging that
comedy deck. Like they're your fans. Yeah,

1663
01:35:56,911 --> 01:35:58,760
yeah, yeah. I go in there,
I don't give a shit.

1664
01:35:58,790 --> 01:36:02,630
And like I had to fall Ian Edwards last
the couple a couple of days ago. Man,

1665
01:36:02,631 --> 01:36:06,230
that kid is funny. Very funny dude. That
guy's one of the best writers I know.

1666
01:36:06,231 --> 01:36:11,231
And he always has huge clumps of new
material and he makes me feel so lazy.

1667
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:15,420
Well you aren't lazy. I'm not lazy.
Dooley's I worked my ass off Bro.

1668
01:36:15,421 --> 01:36:17,660
Cause he lazy.
I write a lot.

1669
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:21,050
I think he's really busy and a lot
of different projects. I don't know.

1670
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:25,240
Let me say, do you feel lazy? Do you
feel lazy when you watch a guy like Ian?

1671
01:36:26,150 --> 01:36:28,740
I sometimes I'll tell you why.

1672
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,990
Let me say when your gig not doing
new new shit, whisper in there.

1673
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:37,800
There's a little feeling dizzy doodle
feeling that you may be lazy. Listen, I,

1674
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:41,120
there was a time when I was doing a little
too much partying and I didn't write

1675
01:36:41,121 --> 01:36:45,410
like I used to. A reality
comes out. I omit that.

1676
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:46,820
I always admit that.

1677
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:50,450
Now I know why people come my podcasts
and stare at themselves. Hold back.

1678
01:36:50,570 --> 01:36:52,810
It's very hard not to look
at yourself on that squeak.

1679
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:56,200
Can you take me off and you can easily
not looked at it. You're a grown man, Sam.

1680
01:36:56,250 --> 01:37:00,850
I'll look me in the eye. I'm a very vain
man. You liking the way you look? No,

1681
01:37:00,851 --> 01:37:05,180
not at all. Being on this podcast right
here on my rare quit drinking. Really?

1682
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:09,030
Yeah, so I'm self all Chubby
and fat faced and then a,

1683
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:12,440
apparently Daniel tosh said it was
bothering him and, and Tom's like,

1684
01:37:12,441 --> 01:37:16,130
you know what? That's it. Yeah.
Well, I'm a, I'm in that same boat.

1685
01:37:16,131 --> 01:37:20,300
I was doing a lot of party. I wish I
could just do a little partying. I just,

1686
01:37:20,301 --> 01:37:22,820
I want to party like it's,
I don't remember flying

1687
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:29,150
Zeplin 1972 I'm going, we just got a
new album out and it's a world tour.

1688
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:34,160
Yeah. That's not good for your liver.
Yeah. Well that's why I wish I had them.

1689
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:35,660
I could just do it a little,

1690
01:37:35,661 --> 01:37:39,890
but for me it's like going to the gym
and just doing like one pushup and then

1691
01:37:39,891 --> 01:37:42,320
you're like, oh, that's all I want
to do. That's not how I do it.

1692
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:44,540
And you can enjoy a little
bit of the marijuana.

1693
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:47,650
Just didn't the can once in a while,
but it's not really like

1694
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:53,810
he has the air. I get really like
paranoid. Yeah. You know why you should.

1695
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:56,400
Life is terrifying.
Should be paranoid.

1696
01:37:56,640 --> 01:38:00,150
You're a little flesh bag,
little flesh bag walking around.

1697
01:38:00,930 --> 01:38:02,520
I was going to here.
That's what we are.

1698
01:38:02,540 --> 01:38:06,020
We're human flesh bags that we're all
coming with vulnerable that cats dude.

1699
01:38:06,150 --> 01:38:06,983
You know why?

1700
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:11,700
Because it's the only place you
could talk some political shit.

1701
01:38:11,701 --> 01:38:13,620
What brains not freezing up on you.

1702
01:38:13,621 --> 01:38:16,880
I did one last night and you
bring up the top and even it's a,

1703
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:20,580
it's a political podcasts and their brains
just freeze and nobody wants to talk

1704
01:38:20,581 --> 01:38:23,520
about Sam triple youtube.
Most of your podcast with porn stars.

1705
01:38:23,670 --> 01:38:27,060
Now that's not true. You do most of
your mum without porn stars. I do.

1706
01:38:27,090 --> 01:38:31,830
I do a wide range of it. That's
one fourth. Yeah, there's still,

1707
01:38:31,831 --> 01:38:34,880
the naughty show is only one fourth porn
stars now to a whole bunch of, okay,

1708
01:38:34,881 --> 01:38:35,820
so I'm,
I'm out of the loop.

1709
01:38:35,821 --> 01:38:38,580
So did you start off at one point in
time was all like you would draw to get

1710
01:38:38,581 --> 01:38:42,380
porn stars on and then you, you just
backed off of it and just fixed it up.

1711
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:46,770
It's like I'm bored with that. I want
to be interviewed. Different things.

1712
01:38:46,771 --> 01:38:48,960
I want to explore different
parts of the world.

1713
01:38:49,170 --> 01:38:50,820
But you find that when
you get in dudes on,

1714
01:38:50,821 --> 01:38:53,100
you talk politics with them
and they freeze it up well,

1715
01:38:53,130 --> 01:38:55,980
and not just necessarily on a podcast,

1716
01:38:55,981 --> 01:39:00,300
but just in general in
like normal conversations.

1717
01:39:00,330 --> 01:39:04,800
This podcast I did last night where it's
like brain just freeze up if you bring

1718
01:39:04,801 --> 01:39:08,850
up, if you challenge someone's
idea, they get like, uh, you know.

1719
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:09,930
But do you think that's what it is?

1720
01:39:09,931 --> 01:39:12,850
I think also people are tired of
hearing about politics. It's gross.

1721
01:39:12,910 --> 01:39:15,810
Like they want to talk about sports,
they want to talk about fun shit.

1722
01:39:15,811 --> 01:39:19,260
They want to talk about movies or video
games or anything. That's fun. It's like,

1723
01:39:19,261 --> 01:39:21,730
you know when they're off of work and
you start bringing up politics like,

1724
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:25,260
Oh fucking Christ with this. You
know? And for a lot of folks,

1725
01:39:25,261 --> 01:39:27,560
I mean that's really how they
look at Shit. It's, it's,

1726
01:39:27,561 --> 01:39:32,340
it's hard to want to concentrate on some
bullshit hustle that you have no real

1727
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:33,780
control over.
Yeah.

1728
01:39:33,781 --> 01:39:37,080
And I also think they're just tired of
the same rhetoric and like they think

1729
01:39:37,081 --> 01:39:41,250
it's going to just devolve into screaming.
You got to put America back to work.

1730
01:39:42,270 --> 01:39:45,160
Why they signed like free trade deals.
That's what I left.

1731
01:39:45,390 --> 01:39:48,480
Like that's why I like to talk about
the stories that you only here for a

1732
01:39:48,481 --> 01:39:51,450
glimpse and then they disappear.
You're like, well what about that?

1733
01:39:51,451 --> 01:39:54,750
And people that are, that's why.
What do you think of Gay Republicans?

1734
01:39:55,470 --> 01:39:59,370
There's a lot of them. Um, it's sorta
like vampire familiars, you know,

1735
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:02,220
they want to stay close to the master,
but it's also like,

1736
01:40:02,221 --> 01:40:07,221
it's very interesting that they decided
to go with their financial needs more

1737
01:40:07,981 --> 01:40:11,670
than their social needs because I feel
like most people vote on their social

1738
01:40:11,671 --> 01:40:13,410
needs. Very complicated. Sam.

1739
01:40:13,970 --> 01:40:17,670
It was a lot of shit going on with being
a gay repo again, first of all, the, the,

1740
01:40:17,671 --> 01:40:20,400
the, the self loathing
aspect of, you know,

1741
01:40:20,610 --> 01:40:24,750
a lot of gay people are very ashamed
of being gay. It's very sad and tragic,

1742
01:40:24,751 --> 01:40:27,600
but it's also true. You know,
I, I know gay people that are,

1743
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:32,660
that like are really uncomfortable about
the way people view people that are

1744
01:40:32,881 --> 01:40:35,610
gay. And so there's some
self-loathing going on.

1745
01:40:35,611 --> 01:40:38,100
There's also people that came from,
you know,

1746
01:40:38,101 --> 01:40:41,130
perhaps they came from like really
restrictive a family environment.

1747
01:40:41,131 --> 01:40:45,930
So they have like a deep sense of
shame and, and their own sexual needs.

1748
01:40:46,230 --> 01:40:49,770
And, you know, they, uh, they,
they don't mind that this,

1749
01:40:49,771 --> 01:40:53,440
a Republican party loads
their existence and,

1750
01:40:53,441 --> 01:40:55,450
and wants to stop them from being married.

1751
01:40:55,451 --> 01:40:59,030
They don't mind as long as
they appear to be, you know,

1752
01:40:59,050 --> 01:41:01,930
they appear to be respectable and
they're connected with the Republicans.

1753
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:04,640
It's like they're having dinner with
the vampire. Right. You know, they're,

1754
01:41:04,650 --> 01:41:07,260
they're like right there with the,
the monster that,

1755
01:41:07,290 --> 01:41:10,360
that holds them back and treats them like
shit and wants to throw rocks at them.

1756
01:41:10,610 --> 01:41:14,770
They caught them fucking, you know, so
there's something to that. Yeah. Well,

1757
01:41:14,771 --> 01:41:17,710
there's something that people become,
well, there's a lot of, uh, you know, uh,

1758
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:20,680
black eyes become, uh, really, uh,

1759
01:41:20,710 --> 01:41:25,050
they become like uncle Tom Ish with,
with, with, with racists. And they, they,

1760
01:41:25,051 --> 01:41:28,840
they embrace the, the one that's
holding the Mac. You know, it's a,

1761
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:33,550
a common thing that's d that drove people
crazy in the black community when they

1762
01:41:33,551 --> 01:41:37,420
would find a, a black eye, you know, cow
town to racists like that just set a,

1763
01:41:37,421 --> 01:41:38,254
you know,

1764
01:41:38,290 --> 01:41:43,180
that that gross sort of a thing whole
came massa whatever you need mass. Right.

1765
01:41:43,250 --> 01:41:47,080
And I'm like man, this is sad shit. Like
what are you doing man? You're, you're,

1766
01:41:47,081 --> 01:41:49,630
you're like, you get need to get
away with this piece of shit.

1767
01:41:49,631 --> 01:41:51,100
This guy's a slave owner.

1768
01:41:51,430 --> 01:41:56,430
One of my favorite bits of years when I
first started watching him perform was

1769
01:41:56,591 --> 01:41:58,540
about how interracial porn is.

1770
01:41:58,541 --> 01:42:03,541
Like the number one porn and it
disproportionate amount of people watch

1771
01:42:05,261 --> 01:42:08,860
internet, interracial porn in the
deep south disproportionate amount.

1772
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:12,020
And I was like, well that's not not
black guys watching that shit. Yeah.

1773
01:42:12,030 --> 01:42:15,760
It's white guys. Yeah. Yeah.
Cause they just so nasty.

1774
01:42:15,970 --> 01:42:19,470
There's just something about
that. It seems so taboo. Boobs.

1775
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:21,920
She bond that black did
limit her enjoying it.

1776
01:42:24,340 --> 01:42:27,820
Yeah. It's a, there's something
fucked up about race hasn't man,

1777
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:33,040
there's something really weird about it
from a state of fear. It's just fear of,

1778
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:37,930
uh, and there's some, uh, you know,
ethnocentrism is also weird shit.

1779
01:42:37,931 --> 01:42:40,630
We were, you know, it's not even
about black people. Like, well,

1780
01:42:40,631 --> 01:42:42,860
how about about like Chinese workers that,
you know,

1781
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:46,330
make your cell phone to get 50
cents a week? I'm exaggerating.

1782
01:42:46,331 --> 01:42:47,620
I don't know what they really
get, but it's, you know,

1783
01:42:47,650 --> 01:42:52,270
the Foxconn suicides and you find out
these factories where all your iPhone shit

1784
01:42:52,271 --> 01:42:57,271
is getting creative is got nets set up
because people want to jump off the roof.

1785
01:42:57,970 --> 01:43:00,430
Like, Oh yeah, yeah, pretty fucking crazy.

1786
01:43:00,431 --> 01:43:03,460
And I've heard people defending
that when they go, well,

1787
01:43:03,490 --> 01:43:07,600
actually if you think about it, the number
of people that commit suicide there,

1788
01:43:07,601 --> 01:43:10,660
it's a actually less
than your average city.

1789
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:13,870
And Foxconn is basically like a city.
There's 500,000 people live in there.

1790
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:18,960
And you're like, yeah, but
most people don't commit
suicide at work. And the, the,

1791
01:43:18,961 --> 01:43:22,300
their whole argument was, well, if
they made an iPhone here in America,

1792
01:43:22,301 --> 01:43:25,600
it will cost $5,000. You're like, okay,

1793
01:43:25,601 --> 01:43:30,070
so that's kind of a like a very
selfish point of view, right? Yeah.

1794
01:43:30,250 --> 01:43:32,860
Well it is true.
It is true that it would cost more money,

1795
01:43:32,861 --> 01:43:35,800
but I think it's been disproven that
it would cost that much more money.

1796
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:39,550
I think they said it would cost like an
extra 50 bucks or something like that.

1797
01:43:39,551 --> 01:43:43,270
And you can make a, an iPhone in, in
America and pay people a fair wage.

1798
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:45,400
I forgot the number,
so I shouldn't really say 50 bucks,

1799
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:47,740
but it wasn't enough to really
shock the shit out of me.

1800
01:43:47,860 --> 01:43:52,010
But then I've seen other ones that say
it's thousands of dollars, like 14,000 so

1801
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:53,180
I don't know who the fuck is.
Right.

1802
01:43:53,181 --> 01:43:56,420
And who's telling the truth and what kind
of funny Hollywood logic they're doing

1803
01:43:56,421 --> 01:44:01,280
as far as their, their math and a lot
racism. Go to China. That's racism, man.

1804
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:04,670
I went there with Steve Burns.
I had a beard on,

1805
01:44:04,671 --> 01:44:09,320
I looked very middle eastern when I get
a beard rocking and I could not get a

1806
01:44:09,321 --> 01:44:12,800
taxi to pick me up because
middle easterns over there,

1807
01:44:12,801 --> 01:44:16,940
they think they're all drug dealers.
So no one would pick us up. So we,

1808
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:21,290
we flagged down this one guy that would
pick us up and he literally had taken

1809
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:26,560
what looks like a hot dog vending machine
and turned it into a taxi and we sat

1810
01:44:27,291 --> 01:44:32,291
in the back and you can ask anybody who
goes to like China driving over there is

1811
01:44:32,990 --> 01:44:36,860
crazy. They have lights
but they don't follow him.

1812
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:38,960
They're like Christmas ornaments,
traffic lights.

1813
01:44:39,050 --> 01:44:41,600
They're just over there blinking
and no one's following them.

1814
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:45,140
Really go through red lights. I
do. Here's a crazy thing, right?

1815
01:44:45,290 --> 01:44:47,450
You want to make a lefthand turn in China.

1816
01:44:47,570 --> 01:44:49,130
You don't make it from the left hand side.

1817
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:54,230
You come all the way from the right
and you turn over there. Why don't,

1818
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:58,220
I don't know why. It's two weirdest thing
I've ever seen. No one does it that way.

1819
01:44:58,221 --> 01:45:01,770
Yeah, but because that's how they do it
over there. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1820
01:45:01,771 --> 01:45:04,460
Wait a minute. They don't ever
turn left from the left lane.

1821
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:07,520
No math from the right and we were
over here. You turn way over there.

1822
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:11,360
Can we find evidence of this online?
Google the I. Everything I say here,

1823
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:16,010
I know will be instantly googled.
Uh, but yeah, man, it's crazy.

1824
01:45:16,011 --> 01:45:17,060
Me and Steve Byrne,

1825
01:45:17,150 --> 01:45:22,150
we screamed like little girls at
least 13 times on the ride home.

1826
01:45:22,851 --> 01:45:25,760
It is scary. Here's the
thing, didn't see one

1827
01:45:26,150 --> 01:45:28,220
traffic accident,
not one over there.

1828
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:31,880
And the bulk of the country
drives on the right. Oh, okay.

1829
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:34,820
I think there's some confusion here.

1830
01:45:35,070 --> 01:45:37,220
Well, I don't know what
the confusion is. I did it.

1831
01:45:37,950 --> 01:45:41,760
I think, um, some of the country
in China drives on the right,

1832
01:45:41,761 --> 01:45:45,870
but some drives on the left. So maybe
that's where the, the, the, the issue is.

1833
01:45:46,770 --> 01:45:47,430
Does that make sense?

1834
01:45:47,430 --> 01:45:49,820
See, after people drive on the
right side and half people,

1835
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:53,110
why I'm telling you man, they
travel. They don't slow down, dude.

1836
01:45:53,111 --> 01:45:56,210
They just go right in to the,
they just go

1837
01:45:56,300 --> 01:46:00,320
right in.
What are we watching accidents?

1838
01:46:00,510 --> 01:46:02,000
This is Chinese trafficked.

1839
01:46:02,290 --> 01:46:05,180
I don't want to see Chinese traffic
cause you know someone's going to get run

1840
01:46:05,181 --> 01:46:08,960
over. There was some horrible
shit that I saw online of a,

1841
01:46:09,650 --> 01:46:14,390
Oh shit.
Oh fuck dude on a motorcycle.

1842
01:46:14,391 --> 01:46:15,060
They nailed it.

1843
01:46:15,060 --> 01:46:19,080
Let's see. That's what they do. They just
drive through. They don't give a shit.

1844
01:46:19,110 --> 01:46:23,790
There's no rules. No. Look at this.
This is nuts. Oh my God, this is nuts.

1845
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:24,601
You know what?

1846
01:46:24,601 --> 01:46:29,310
I hate seeing stereotypes played
out right before my fucking eyes,

1847
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:34,800
but where are the Chinese Nascar drivers?
Oh my God.

1848
01:46:34,801 --> 01:46:38,370
He just nailed an old lady on her bike.
Oh my God.

1849
01:46:38,371 --> 01:46:42,600
These people are fucking crazy telling
you, man, you scream like a little girl,

1850
01:46:42,601 --> 01:46:46,200
like dried mixed.
Look at this video.

1851
01:46:46,201 --> 01:46:47,640
This is crazy.

1852
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:52,710
These people are in the with the shitty
cars and they just drive and through

1853
01:46:52,711 --> 01:46:53,610
intersections.

1854
01:46:55,590 --> 01:46:58,540
I hate saying this because
I know on it would,

1855
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:02,760
I don't want to believe in
stereotypes. Oh Jesus. Oh,

1856
01:47:02,761 --> 01:47:05,940
hit by a bike and the other guy
runs over him and then keeps going.

1857
01:47:06,270 --> 01:47:09,390
They don't care, dude. There's
a billion of them. Oh my God.

1858
01:47:09,391 --> 01:47:12,990
Look at this guy trying to make it across.
This is insane.

1859
01:47:12,991 --> 01:47:17,310
This guy cannot do this. He must back
up and rethink and get a helicopter.

1860
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:22,410
That's the only way he's getting across
that lane. People are fucking nuts, man.

1861
01:47:22,590 --> 01:47:25,880
They don't care. I don't like watching
this. This has given me mad anxiety.

1862
01:47:25,890 --> 01:47:29,580
Can you imagine? Oh Jesus
Christ. He's kind of motorcycle.

1863
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:35,810
Oh he had dodged one and then
got nailed by another. Oh my God.

1864
01:47:35,820 --> 01:47:39,540
They man, the fact that those guys are
stopped is amazing. It just like they,

1865
01:47:39,541 --> 01:47:43,380
we vote Jesus. Look at this.
Oh Jesus, look at this.

1866
01:47:43,381 --> 01:47:48,300
Boom. Oh my God. These
people on bikes are insane.

1867
01:47:48,301 --> 01:47:50,970
They're trying to cross the
traffic. They just say ready. Go.

1868
01:47:51,150 --> 01:47:54,400
Their streets must just be like egg
drop soup everywhere. Just brain.

1869
01:47:54,450 --> 01:47:55,283
What they saying.

1870
01:47:55,440 --> 01:48:00,210
A lot of it has to do with the Chinese
culture and the way they interact with

1871
01:48:00,211 --> 01:48:04,080
people. They mind their own business. They
don't look to the left into the right.

1872
01:48:04,081 --> 01:48:08,430
They just keep, keep straight. And
because of that, this leak there socially,

1873
01:48:08,431 --> 01:48:11,400
this is explained to me by a
Chinese man that the, the, the,

1874
01:48:11,401 --> 01:48:13,410
the way they're socially,
um,

1875
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:16,740
sort of a groom to interact
with people and walking.

1876
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:20,220
Cause there's so many people you bump
into people all the time that they've sort

1877
01:48:20,221 --> 01:48:23,940
of taking this and then drive.
They drive with the same mentality.

1878
01:48:23,941 --> 01:48:25,700
They go through red lights.
Yeah,

1879
01:48:25,770 --> 01:48:28,170
exact opposite of what you're
supposed to do when you're driving.

1880
01:48:28,171 --> 01:48:30,900
You're supposed to look to the left,
look to light, check your rear view.

1881
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:34,860
Look who's beside you. Check.
This is fucking crazy ass
hole. He might drive nutty.

1882
01:48:34,861 --> 01:48:38,340
Let me back off. Let him ahead. Amazed
about you while we were in Sacramento.

1883
01:48:38,341 --> 01:48:42,210
How much you follow the rules
of the road? Really? Yeah.

1884
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:46,230
Like yeah.
Well what did you think I would do?

1885
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:49,860
We'll look at bigs. No, when my
fake my own cop light on the roof.

1886
01:48:50,790 --> 01:48:53,910
Not that at all.
But when like drinking bottles,

1887
01:48:54,510 --> 01:48:58,650
when drug and red band
with our gps to the,

1888
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:03,890
where we went to go eat
afterwards. Uh, you did a u turn,

1889
01:49:03,891 --> 01:49:06,690
you're like a make a uturn here and you're
like, ah, I can't do that right here.

1890
01:49:06,691 --> 01:49:07,620
I have to pull in over here.

1891
01:49:07,621 --> 01:49:10,680
Like I would have been like
just you turn right there,

1892
01:49:10,850 --> 01:49:14,070
there's a little sign that says no.
You turn and when you see one of those,

1893
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:17,430
don't take a fucking new term. It's not
that hard. Well there's nobody coming.

1894
01:49:17,431 --> 01:49:19,190
I would you turn it in common,

1895
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:22,620
but that could be someone
watching Sam cops.

1896
01:49:22,621 --> 01:49:25,650
You don't want to give them an excuse
to pull you over. It Says No. You turn.

1897
01:49:25,651 --> 01:49:29,220
How hard is it to take a left pull
into a driveway and turn in an Rv Park?

1898
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:32,010
Pretty fucking easy. Yeah. We
went to an ivy mark when, uh,

1899
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:34,440
if they ever do you have season China,

1900
01:49:34,441 --> 01:49:38,640
you should do a show because there's
tons of ex pats cause it's like the wild

1901
01:49:38,641 --> 01:49:42,060
west over there. It's like you don't
have everybody in China, in China.

1902
01:49:42,070 --> 01:49:45,210
There's a lot of ex pats. I had
the best time out there, man.

1903
01:49:45,570 --> 01:49:48,190
You did a lot of stand up.
Steve Byrne took me out.

1904
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:53,080
We did a co we gigs all over the
place. Man. Shanghai is the shit man.

1905
01:49:53,081 --> 01:49:57,220
I really, Shanghai is the shit dude.
Who knows how people, I don't know.

1906
01:49:57,221 --> 01:50:00,440
Steve Byrne took care of it and he'd
say, Hey, you want to come out? I'm like,

1907
01:50:00,550 --> 01:50:03,370
yeah man, I'll do it. And
it was a great time, man.

1908
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:05,690
I saw an Anthony Bordain
special in Shanghai.

1909
01:50:05,691 --> 01:50:08,910
It looked like he was having
a good fucking time. Dude.
They leave. They leave.

1910
01:50:08,911 --> 01:50:12,370
If you're like an American, they'd leave
you alone, man. I think it was Shane.

1911
01:50:12,371 --> 01:50:15,250
I had to leave you alone, dude. Oh yeah.

1912
01:50:15,251 --> 01:50:19,690
He'd drink all night and it's like old,
the old west where men are men. Dude.

1913
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:22,330
It's like a gray, like, whoa.
This is what it was like. Well,

1914
01:50:22,331 --> 01:50:24,880
you're telling me is you can go to
a massage power and get jerked off.

1915
01:50:25,420 --> 01:50:29,470
Anything you want over there as a,
as a, as an American man. Really.

1916
01:50:29,530 --> 01:50:34,190
I had the best time. How's the food?
Food's phenomenal, man. Dude dies.

1917
01:50:34,450 --> 01:50:38,830
They'll eat it. Whoa. That's how China,
you go to a menu, they're like squirrel.

1918
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:41,320
They got everything and they're
throwing anything on a grill.

1919
01:50:41,350 --> 01:50:43,630
Did you fuck around at all and
experiment with different kinds of,

1920
01:50:43,890 --> 01:50:46,300
you need a dog or anything?
No, I, you know what man,

1921
01:50:46,330 --> 01:50:48,980
I can't eat a dog and I don't want to eat.
Like they put,

1922
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,700
they do that thing from Indiana Jones
where they put a monkey in the middle of

1923
01:50:51,701 --> 01:50:54,070
the fucking table and he started
whacking on fat and I'm like,

1924
01:50:54,490 --> 01:50:56,860
that never happened to me. But I'm
like, dude, I can't watch this.

1925
01:50:56,861 --> 01:50:59,780
I don't want to eat this
thing. And they'll watch it
getting pound on the, hey,

1926
01:50:59,790 --> 01:51:00,940
what did they hit with a hammer?

1927
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:04,450
They hit the monkey's head like
they didn't do it for me, but I,

1928
01:51:04,550 --> 01:51:07,060
someone told me they were over
there in China and they were, they,

1929
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:11,200
they like put them in the middle thing,
locked him up. Heads. You stay and they go

1930
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:16,240
rains, right? Yeah, I can't do
it. What the fuck is that man?

1931
01:51:16,241 --> 01:51:20,350
How is that a real way to eat? I just
think it's just cruel. Delicious.

1932
01:51:20,650 --> 01:51:24,640
But you think it is because you would
want to whack on a poor monkey's head.

1933
01:51:24,670 --> 01:51:27,760
You know that like how smart they are.
Well you know what it is. I think,

1934
01:51:27,790 --> 01:51:30,820
I think if you're trying to like
appease only the elite, you know,

1935
01:51:30,821 --> 01:51:33,770
and give them some crazy thing
that only they have access to is a,

1936
01:51:34,030 --> 01:51:38,080
there's a certain satisfaction that some
sick fucks get into being cruel and to

1937
01:51:38,081 --> 01:51:40,600
having something that's so delicate.
It's such a delicacy.

1938
01:51:40,601 --> 01:51:45,430
So rare we have brought in a special
McCall monkey, you know, poor little fuck.

1939
01:51:45,431 --> 01:51:48,840
It's locked up in a little guillotine
choke. You mean Agar old? The goal,

1940
01:51:48,841 --> 01:51:51,310
as soon as they put the monkey and
the thing I'm out, they sat in real.

1941
01:51:51,310 --> 01:51:55,360
Cause I heard that the scene in
faces of death was faked that scene.

1942
01:51:55,361 --> 01:51:58,510
Well that's probably, that part is
fake, but they really do do that.

1943
01:51:58,511 --> 01:52:00,550
Do they really? Yeah.
Okay. Let's look that up.

1944
01:52:00,810 --> 01:52:05,580
That seems like something I showed
them. No Rogan's fact checks. But yeah.

1945
01:52:05,620 --> 01:52:10,620
So it say among his sound effect check
bonky hit with so far Sam's record

1946
01:52:13,001 --> 01:52:17,280
hammer. So monkey and
hit with a hammer, uh,

1947
01:52:17,290 --> 01:52:22,130
in front of guests. Maybe diners,
front of diners, Youtube. That shit,

1948
01:52:22,131 --> 01:52:25,870
man. Youtube that sheet.
Let's see. Faces of death.

1949
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:30,760
The monkey diner scene is
also unconvincing. Yeah. Okay.

1950
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:34,210
But it, but it does, it actually
happen. This is, it's a lot of,

1951
01:52:34,211 --> 01:52:38,920
this is all about the, uh, can you Google
that? Does monkey eating monkey brains?

1952
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:42,940
Yeah. Maybe another search. Let me try
another shirt. Shop eating monkey brains.

1953
01:52:43,060 --> 01:52:47,930
I couldn't do that, dude. That's
another reason I just, I want China.

1954
01:52:48,140 --> 01:52:49,640
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's uh,

1955
01:52:49,820 --> 01:52:54,630
eating monkey brains and China's actually
monkey baby is controversial food

1956
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:59,600
stuff often attributed
to the Chinese. Okay.

1957
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:02,480
Wow. This is crazy, dude.
If you go to Google,

1958
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:06,140
they have images of like
pleats of monkey brains. Dude,

1959
01:53:06,141 --> 01:53:09,490
I don't want to see that here too.
It's also found it's not,

1960
01:53:09,491 --> 01:53:12,770
it's a controversial food stuff
often attributed to the Chinese,

1961
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:14,870
but also found is certain other countries,

1962
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:18,920
the practice of eating monkey brains
has led to over hunting in Indonesia.

1963
01:53:19,070 --> 01:53:22,760
Especially due to the unfounded belief
that eating monkey brains can cure

1964
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:25,820
impotence. It turns is about
curing impotence with these fucks.

1965
01:53:26,150 --> 01:53:27,800
They're always eating no China,

1966
01:53:27,890 --> 01:53:31,010
they're always even like tiger claw
and all this nutty shit that doesn't do

1967
01:53:31,011 --> 01:53:34,190
anything to try to cure and
don't they know about Viagara.

1968
01:53:34,370 --> 01:53:38,480
Why do you have to have monkey brains
when you have viagara silly box that's

1969
01:53:38,580 --> 01:53:41,960
discussing the brain is when the,
when the Beijing Olympics happened,

1970
01:53:42,140 --> 01:53:44,750
they put out the government without,
you can't serve dog.

1971
01:53:44,750 --> 01:53:49,010
Cause they knew like Westerners would
freak out and they were told they have to

1972
01:53:49,011 --> 01:53:52,520
serve black people. Cause the Chinese,
they're not in the black people,

1973
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:57,440
but yet they love Kobe Bryant and
Lebron James and all that shit.

1974
01:53:57,441 --> 01:54:01,760
But they had to put that out to the
Chinese. Don't care man. It's okay.

1975
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:03,450
Here's a problem.
Uh,

1976
01:54:03,530 --> 01:54:07,310
the eating of monkey brains from living
monkeys is a part of some restaurants

1977
01:54:07,311 --> 01:54:11,540
menu is this one? Well, no example
of urban legend. It's not true.

1978
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:17,630
Yeah. They don't actually eat monkeys
like that in restaurants. I mean,

1979
01:54:17,631 --> 01:54:21,890
maybe someone's tried it,
but it's not a every restaurant.

1980
01:54:21,891 --> 01:54:24,340
I still get a point for
that. That's real shit. Well,

1981
01:54:24,350 --> 01:54:29,120
monkey brains eating monkey brains is
real shit. Thank. Apparently they just,

1982
01:54:29,140 --> 01:54:33,140
they'd cook them too.
It's like also it was a scene in Indiana.

1983
01:54:33,141 --> 01:54:36,500
Jones been a scene of a
bunch of movies. But, uh,

1984
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:40,790
I don't say according to this article
at least it seems to think that it's an

1985
01:54:40,791 --> 01:54:44,450
urban legend. Maybe I should check
Snopes. Snopes as good at that shit.

1986
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:46,910
How about we just agree I'm
right and we just, well,

1987
01:54:46,911 --> 01:54:49,220
you definitely are right about
the meat and monkey brains.

1988
01:54:49,630 --> 01:54:54,630
I want to know whether or not they
actually hold the fucking monkey in that

1989
01:54:54,951 --> 01:54:58,680
little box and beat his head and
then scoop it out. Speaking of, okay,

1990
01:54:58,700 --> 01:55:01,520
here's a question.
Speaking of Monkey.

1991
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:01,971
Yeah.
I,

1992
01:55:01,971 --> 01:55:06,971
I found out that Bobby leads in a new
TV show or now I NBC where he plays with

1993
01:55:07,141 --> 01:55:11,090
the monkey from the hangover and I guess
that that the monkey is going to be a

1994
01:55:11,091 --> 01:55:12,650
huge,
it's going to be a new monkey show.

1995
01:55:12,760 --> 01:55:15,480
And like every week it's happening
in the bear. Yeah. Oh, so based,

1996
01:55:15,481 --> 01:55:16,370
supposedly really funny.

1997
01:55:16,371 --> 01:55:20,160
It's lobbying and a monkey like tested
like the highest they've ever tested on

1998
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:25,160
NBC. Any, yeah. Any TV show
ever on NBC lobbyists. A
monkey. Gabby, Leanna, monkey.

1999
01:55:25,790 --> 01:55:29,330
Can't wait. Yeah. What,
what, what happens with that?

2000
01:55:29,410 --> 01:55:32,570
This rehearsed that scene.
It's like a monkey.

2001
01:55:34,050 --> 01:55:37,430
Yeah. That's a, how do you get the
monkey to do what you want them to do?

2002
01:55:39,120 --> 01:55:42,560
Yeah. It's either going to be the greatest
thing ever or the worst thing ever,

2003
01:55:42,561 --> 01:55:44,400
but I have feeling it's
feelings to be phenomenal.

2004
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:48,150
I think anything Bobby Lee's going to be
as funny. Yeah, that mustache is lethal.

2005
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:51,810
He's hilarious.
So it's Todd glass man on the burn.

2006
01:55:51,811 --> 01:55:53,700
If he'd get to check out
Todd glass on the burn,

2007
01:55:53,701 --> 01:55:56,340
he just fucking came in there
and just destroyed. Well,

2008
01:55:56,341 --> 01:55:59,370
he's a guy who's just fast and
always had a great opinion.

2009
01:55:59,371 --> 01:56:03,210
Anytime you watch them on stage, he's
the guy that's very much in the moment.

2010
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:07,800
He's not just, it's not just complete
scripted. He, he's not afraid to lay in,

2011
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:09,480
lay the wood to the crowd.

2012
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:13,950
Would you ever get high and
go scouting what? Scouting?

2013
01:56:14,090 --> 01:56:16,920
Like Eagle Scout and you were talking
about the boy scouts earlier and I was

2014
01:56:16,921 --> 01:56:20,430
thinking how cool it would it be just
like once a month you and your friends get

2015
01:56:20,431 --> 01:56:23,760
high and go scouting in the woods
just to make fun of the other scouts.

2016
01:56:23,761 --> 01:56:25,920
So it'd be like pretty funny.
No,

2017
01:56:25,921 --> 01:56:29,420
because we're too old for
that and they add our age.

2018
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:32,520
You put in the scouts were
probably pedophiles. Okay,

2019
01:56:32,740 --> 01:56:35,380
here's the deal. Um, this is the deal.

2020
01:56:35,470 --> 01:56:38,650
A lot of people do eat monkey brains,

2021
01:56:38,651 --> 01:56:41,020
Ra and they shoot them.

2022
01:56:41,050 --> 01:56:45,070
They have a special way of shooting
the monkey out of the tree. Oh yeah.

2023
01:56:45,071 --> 01:56:46,810
We shoot them to get them to jump first.

2024
01:56:46,811 --> 01:56:49,720
You shoot Adam and he jumps and then
you have to shoot him because you can't

2025
01:56:49,721 --> 01:56:52,120
just shoot them when they're up in
the tree because they'll, you know,

2026
01:56:52,121 --> 01:56:54,400
they'll lock onto a branch
and then they'll rot up there.

2027
01:56:54,401 --> 01:56:57,220
You can never get them down.
It's really crazy. The,

2028
01:56:57,221 --> 01:56:59,810
apparently they shoot
him all the time and uh,

2029
01:56:59,860 --> 01:57:04,810
but the monkey brains are eating raw and
they do eat them like generally right

2030
01:57:04,811 --> 01:57:09,040
after they killed him. So
that, that is, that is a real,

2031
01:57:09,070 --> 01:57:12,040
a way they eat the monkey brands.
That's fucked up.

2032
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:16,810
Yeah. I don't want that man. That's like
going to a hamburger restaurant and hey,

2033
01:57:16,811 --> 01:57:19,000
here's your sledge hammer
and you got to go like,

2034
01:57:19,001 --> 01:57:23,800
just drop the wood on some a cow,
man. I like, I don't dig that at all.

2035
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:28,800
Yeah. Whoa. Okay. Well, here's
the, here's another thing though.

2036
01:57:28,801 --> 01:57:33,390
A guy is, uh, giving a depiction
in another article, uh,

2037
01:57:33,470 --> 01:57:36,780
of a monkey's head being
supported in a bracket,

2038
01:57:36,930 --> 01:57:40,110
two pieces of wood with a semicircular
hole on each side so that when you put

2039
01:57:40,111 --> 01:57:42,420
them together, they form a complete
circle around the animal's neck,

2040
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:44,880
allowing the head to be
exposed above the plank.

2041
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:49,110
The hair around the head is shaved with
a razor blade and a small chisel and a

2042
01:57:49,111 --> 01:57:53,640
hammer is used to quickly chisel a circle
around the crown and the top part of

2043
01:57:53,641 --> 01:57:57,150
the skull is removed.
A teaspoon is used to scoop up the brains,

2044
01:57:57,330 --> 01:58:02,010
which is immediately, this has to be
done before the monkey dies. Oh God.

2045
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:07,020
Why you just unnecessary there
people? Wow. So this is a,

2046
01:58:07,230 --> 01:58:11,580
not only will you a corrected that
has happened that this is, um,

2047
01:58:11,610 --> 01:58:16,290
this has been going on for a long time.
This was written in 1948 or 1949.

2048
01:58:17,010 --> 01:58:20,130
He's an eye witness. And he didn't
say whether or not he'd partaken in.

2049
01:58:20,131 --> 01:58:23,760
The brain's themselves. Look
behind. You know, don't, don't,
dude, I want to see that.

2050
01:58:23,790 --> 01:58:27,330
Is that legit? Dude? I
want to see that. Whoa.

2051
01:58:27,331 --> 01:58:31,380
This is fucking crazy. Keeping
on, keeping on. Keeping on.

2052
01:58:31,470 --> 01:58:35,650
Uh, this is just a documentary talking
about the faces of death documentary.

2053
01:58:36,020 --> 01:58:40,920
So is it real? They're saying
that this is a real middle of the,

2054
01:58:41,060 --> 01:58:42,430
the table.
We're prepared

2055
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:43,263
for the kill.

2056
01:58:49,660 --> 01:58:51,250
You don't have to watch it.
We don't have to watch it.

2057
01:58:51,251 --> 01:58:53,280
You can watch it if you
want. Yeah. We don't know.

2058
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:54,760
Some people that want to see that shit.

2059
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:59,940
Um, you know what? What is
that? Is that just a Desperado?

2060
01:58:59,950 --> 01:59:04,400
They just need food so bad. It just seems
like when you go that deep or you're,

2061
01:59:04,460 --> 01:59:08,080
you're being cruel to a monkey like that.
You're not, you. You want to scoop out.

2062
01:59:08,081 --> 01:59:12,280
His brains were still alive. Yeah. And
you know how smart they are. I just,

2063
01:59:12,281 --> 01:59:16,660
I don't know. Ever since I got a dog,
I'm really sensitive. What about animal?

2064
01:59:16,661 --> 01:59:19,280
What about monkeys that are assholes?
Yeah, there's a lot of them.

2065
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:23,770
Monkeys are assholes.
They killed the mayor in India.

2066
01:59:23,950 --> 01:59:26,090
Monkeys assaulted and killed a mayor.

2067
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:30,310
The mayor was just hanging out and the
monkeys just walked up and just mean

2068
01:59:30,311 --> 01:59:34,150
mugged him. He's fucking with the
monkeys. Why would he do that?

2069
01:59:34,180 --> 01:59:36,400
I think monkeys steal things from you.

2070
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:40,000
They steal food from you and shiny things
and you have to give them food to get

2071
01:59:40,001 --> 01:59:44,020
the shiny things back sometimes and they
steal things that they think that you

2072
01:59:44,021 --> 01:59:45,960
will find valuable.
Like they'll steal your cell phone.

2073
01:59:46,010 --> 01:59:47,380
You have to give them food to get it back.

2074
01:59:47,740 --> 01:59:50,020
And if you just try to take the cell
phone, they'll fucking attack you.

2075
01:59:50,140 --> 01:59:53,640
That sounds like it's survival. I mean
like there's a bit of survival. They,

2076
01:59:53,670 --> 01:59:57,790
I just, I don't know man. When I see
people fucking with animals, I just,

2077
01:59:57,850 --> 02:00:00,770
I root for the animal. I don't know
why they don't have any commerce.

2078
02:00:00,820 --> 02:00:05,620
They don't have any concept
of personal like property.

2079
02:00:05,740 --> 02:00:09,520
Like they don't get that. They don't own
things. So when you have something shiny,

2080
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:12,700
they're a little brain knows that
if they just Jack your shiny shit,

2081
02:00:12,970 --> 02:00:15,580
then you have to give them food and
wanted to get that shiny shit back.

2082
02:00:15,610 --> 02:00:20,170
That's how their culture
works. So you bribed monkeys?
Yes. You can bribe him. Yeah,

2083
02:00:20,171 --> 02:00:21,100
you can get your shit back.

2084
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:25,910
There's actually like a small town or
village that there's are a monkey that

2085
02:00:25,911 --> 02:00:28,310
would tried to rape a bunch
of women and that were,

2086
02:00:28,790 --> 02:00:32,160
here's the article on the Telegraph.
I'll just live monkeys.

2087
02:00:32,540 --> 02:00:35,840
Just looks like a rapist. Monkey
tried to take it. Look at his face.

2088
02:00:36,050 --> 02:00:39,220
He looks all rapists.
That definitely is a rapey monk.

2089
02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:41,030
That's a Reiki looking a little monkey.

2090
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:45,350
Okay. This mean face. This looks like
he doesn't give a fuck about anything.

2091
02:00:46,070 --> 02:00:47,270
Take your manhood.
Oh,

2092
02:00:47,271 --> 02:00:50,400
he'll fuck you would not want to go to
jail and share a cell with that monkey.

2093
02:00:50,401 --> 02:00:52,820
You imagine. How long could you
think you could fight off a monkey?

2094
02:00:53,510 --> 02:00:55,860
I was at the zoo the other
day and the dude who a,

2095
02:00:55,950 --> 02:00:58,440
the got an a little train tour,
you know,

2096
02:00:58,610 --> 02:01:00,970
and the dude who's gay
gave us the train tour,

2097
02:01:00,971 --> 02:01:04,610
said that these little monkeys
that they had were only 25 pounds,

2098
02:01:04,790 --> 02:01:07,130
but they had twice the
strength of a grown man.

2099
02:01:07,490 --> 02:01:12,110
Is that real fuck does a monkey
that's 25 pounds have twice.

2100
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:13,820
Imagine a retarded monkey.

2101
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:21,590
Superman strength.
Take 75 is so rude.

2102
02:01:21,591 --> 02:01:23,880
Do they have down syndrome monkeys?
I was saying about that.

2103
02:01:23,881 --> 02:01:28,180
You never see that in any other
animal, do you? No. No you don't. Yeah,

2104
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:29,110
we'll sign.

2105
02:01:29,110 --> 02:01:32,280
He's looked like Johnny has like the
Johnny Carson eyes where the closer

2106
02:01:32,281 --> 02:01:36,440
together. So I think so. I think
some of those monkeys might be, no,

2107
02:01:36,450 --> 02:01:39,950
I don't think so. I don't think
they live. I don't think, uh,

2108
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:42,710
I don't know. I'm, I'm guessing,
but I don't think that they,

2109
02:01:42,910 --> 02:01:46,460
I don't think they live.
Monk monkeys are like Asians.

2110
02:01:46,461 --> 02:01:48,050
They put a stop to that shit quick.

2111
02:01:48,290 --> 02:01:52,610
This guy's saying that I've seen a 25
pound monkey overpower 50 pound man.

2112
02:01:52,900 --> 02:01:57,470
A 50 pound man. Was We all, sorry,
150 pound male. Sorry. Yeah.

2113
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:02,090
Um, this was a guy who is
a, um, an anthropologist,

2114
02:02:02,091 --> 02:02:04,040
but that guy could have been
a pussy. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2115
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:05,750
And you ever see that
one video where like,

2116
02:02:05,780 --> 02:02:08,750
they showed that women could beat up
guys and they had like a girl box,

2117
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:13,220
but it was like the most feminine Asian
Man could possibly flows. They did.

2118
02:02:13,221 --> 02:02:16,430
They had a boxing match
between when a woman and a man,

2119
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:20,750
the battle of the sexes and the
guy they got was the most feminine,

2120
02:02:20,850 --> 02:02:25,580
Real Asian Man I've ever seen.
He's guys asked straight up whooped.

2121
02:02:26,390 --> 02:02:28,940
Okay, so they set it up.
They get chicken. Well, yeah,

2122
02:02:28,941 --> 02:02:30,500
you put Ronda Rousey and what some dude,

2123
02:02:30,501 --> 02:02:34,420
it doesn't have to have know how to
fight. She will fuck you up. I would quit.

2124
02:02:35,150 --> 02:02:38,990
I do like that. I love her. Just getting
mouthy. So high angled by is really hot.

2125
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,450
It's hot as fuck. She's cool
as fuck too. She can hang man.

2126
02:02:41,451 --> 02:02:45,800
She can hang with anybody and she trains
hard. I was talking to some dudes today,

2127
02:02:45,801 --> 02:02:48,380
they've got arm barred her
by her it cold cars place.

2128
02:02:48,381 --> 02:02:52,520
The only reason I couldn't date a girl
like that skilled in MMA is because I've

2129
02:02:52,521 --> 02:02:57,290
literally been swung on by every girl
I've ever dated. So I mean the girl,

2130
02:02:57,300 --> 02:03:00,410
you've pretty much,
at some point they swung on me and

2131
02:03:04,180 --> 02:03:07,180
I never hit a girl in my life.
Oh well that's not what we're saying.

2132
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:11,390
But why would all these people, sometimes
they get emotional with me. Why?

2133
02:03:11,391 --> 02:03:13,880
What do you Sam, what are you
doing to these girls? Sometimes.

2134
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:18,410
Sometimes I got to play a bad guy and
I got to cut off the Dick for a little

2135
02:03:18,411 --> 02:03:22,130
while is sometimes you cut off the Dick.
That's what makes him swing.

2136
02:03:22,490 --> 02:03:26,620
What kind of magic, Dick, are
you swinging? Fucking Mandy Dick,

2137
02:03:26,780 --> 02:03:30,080
kind of delicious candy. Did
Sam Shipley. I got Cuckoo Dick.

2138
02:03:30,081 --> 02:03:32,840
I got to make the girls go. I
got stocker Dick. I'm not hung,

2139
02:03:33,020 --> 02:03:37,490
but for some reason they go
stocker crazy. Really? Yeah. Wow.

2140
02:03:37,550 --> 02:03:40,340
That's interesting. You just know
how to fuck. Is that what it is?

2141
02:03:40,570 --> 02:03:43,490
I take a lot of pride in that. Take
a lot of pride in your work. Well,

2142
02:03:43,491 --> 02:03:43,971
you know what?

2143
02:03:43,971 --> 02:03:47,240
I've seen what you do on stage and if you
could rock it like that in the bedroom,

2144
02:03:47,241 --> 02:03:50,450
I would imagine would be pretty
blown away by your performance.

2145
02:03:50,450 --> 02:03:53,240
I got to find a girl with a small set
of vagina and then we're good to go.

2146
02:03:53,241 --> 02:03:55,910
You know, small. I'm
not hung it all. Okay.

2147
02:03:56,150 --> 02:03:58,520
You just need a small vagina
that you could really tear up.

2148
02:03:58,750 --> 02:04:01,730
I could get a big one and just, you
know, I got to work a little harder.

2149
02:04:01,731 --> 02:04:04,330
But how do you gauge whether or not
a girl is a small vagina? No. Oh,

2150
02:04:04,350 --> 02:04:07,510
I put it in and if I'm banging the sides,
it's a little bigger than if,

2151
02:04:07,580 --> 02:04:10,730
and then there, there used to
be this chicken, uh, Canada.

2152
02:04:10,731 --> 02:04:13,340
Way Back in the day I used to bang.
I mean,

2153
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:18,080
I've never felt something that type
before in my life. I mean, I was,

2154
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:21,440
I'm not, and I'm not
hungry. I'm like, Oh my God,

2155
02:04:21,710 --> 02:04:26,700
I'm fighting to get it in. It was, was
she muscular? No. Is it her asshole? No.

2156
02:04:27,370 --> 02:04:29,900
Was it her taint?
You just broke a hole through her team.

2157
02:04:30,860 --> 02:04:34,750
You didn't even fuck are
you just stabbed her? Yeah.

2158
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:38,070
I dated a girl who was not a small girl.
She was a big

2159
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:40,620
girl, man. I mean, she was like, uh,

2160
02:04:41,070 --> 02:04:45,150
like stout that she was a like,
I think she's mostly Ukrainian.

2161
02:04:45,270 --> 02:04:49,800
She's really strong. Like a strong,
her policy was like, oh, vice. Yep,

2162
02:04:49,860 --> 02:04:51,960
like a vice. I was like, wow,

2163
02:04:52,020 --> 02:04:56,220
like I've dated girls that were like way
smaller than her physically with like

2164
02:04:56,221 --> 02:04:57,000
bigger vaginas.

2165
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:01,370
I have a theory that's where
it's not completely sound right

2166
02:05:01,410 --> 02:05:04,950
but like the taller,
bigger girls had the tighter vaginas.

2167
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:08,280
A smaller smaller girls have the,
I don't think so cause I was met.

2168
02:05:08,281 --> 02:05:12,000
I'll tall girls have giant pussies to
what's weird is my first and my first

2169
02:05:12,001 --> 02:05:13,140
girlfriend ever.

2170
02:05:13,230 --> 02:05:18,230
I could fist and I was talking to this
today like I remember like kind of

2171
02:05:18,991 --> 02:05:23,160
squeeze my hand and I get it in there
and then it was just like go town and I

2172
02:05:23,161 --> 02:05:26,340
would wait a minute,
that's a meme right there.

2173
02:05:26,550 --> 02:05:29,850
I would squeeze my fingers know and get
my whole hand in there and then it was

2174
02:05:29,851 --> 02:05:31,150
just like go town.

2175
02:05:34,110 --> 02:05:35,750
But but

2176
02:05:39,700 --> 02:05:41,400
you'd have little hands. No
I'm, that's what I'm saying.

2177
02:05:41,401 --> 02:05:44,640
Did I just have small hands as a child
now and now I'm trying to think what if I

2178
02:05:44,641 --> 02:05:46,950
have really small hands and everyone
made fun of me. I didn't know about it.

2179
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:51,390
How old were you? 1515 a buddy of
mine and I hate telling his story,

2180
02:05:51,391 --> 02:05:53,310
but it's so good for a year.
He's,

2181
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:57,720
he always tells me about all these crazy
craigslist shit he does and back page

2182
02:05:57,960 --> 02:06:01,830
and he goes, he goes, yeah. He goes,
I want to hook up with this chick.

2183
02:06:02,130 --> 02:06:05,970
And she goes,
she made me fist her while she watched

2184
02:06:06,230 --> 02:06:10,700
gay porn. Whoa. And like all
fist, her ass, her pussy,

2185
02:06:10,730 --> 02:06:12,200
her pussy.
And I go,

2186
02:06:12,330 --> 02:06:16,470
Huh. And then did you have to pay her
because you're doing all the work,

2187
02:06:16,530 --> 02:06:20,460
work on that and what did he get out
of it? I don't know. He gets off.

2188
02:06:20,461 --> 02:06:24,290
I'm begging hookers. It's this thing.
She's a hooker. I mean like it's a,

2189
02:06:24,420 --> 02:06:28,860
it's a bat like backpage is
really hooker. Ish. Okay.

2190
02:06:28,861 --> 02:06:33,210
So he's getting this girl in this
really hooker ish manner and then he's,

2191
02:06:33,290 --> 02:06:35,550
and it's his story. I want to give him
credit. I just don't know. Honestly,

2192
02:06:35,820 --> 02:06:39,600
I don't know if he wants his name.
Don't say his name just in case he's a,

2193
02:06:39,630 --> 02:06:42,540
so he's fisting them and paying them.

2194
02:06:43,310 --> 02:06:46,870
I'm like, why are you paying them? They
should pay you. I've heard a dude's to,

2195
02:06:47,030 --> 02:06:47,680
I've heard of it,
kind of

2196
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:50,620
a gay dudes who pay guys
to suck their dicks,

2197
02:06:51,430 --> 02:06:53,590
pay like straight guys and
suck their dicks like that.

2198
02:06:53,591 --> 02:06:56,230
Apparently it's pretty common.
I don't know. Can you be,

2199
02:06:56,231 --> 02:06:58,900
it's better than giving plasma.
I bet you know that. You know,

2200
02:06:58,901 --> 02:07:01,630
like when he kicked drawing for money,
by the way,

2201
02:07:01,780 --> 02:07:05,830
we're going to get that Peter Duesberg
guy on the podcast and people have told

2202
02:07:05,831 --> 02:07:10,240
me that it's an irresponsible
thing to do, uh, that he's, uh,

2203
02:07:10,300 --> 02:07:14,350
the professor is a unit from the
University of California Berkeley and is a

2204
02:07:14,590 --> 02:07:18,370
biology professor,
is rock solid credentials this guy has.

2205
02:07:18,970 --> 02:07:23,970
And he apparently claims that HIV is a
virus and it is not what is responsible

2206
02:07:27,131 --> 02:07:30,940
for aids. He claims that AIDS is, uh,

2207
02:07:31,090 --> 02:07:33,970
what it is is when people
have a crushed immune system,

2208
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:36,190
most likely in the gay community,

2209
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:38,170
it has to do with
partying and has to do it.

2210
02:07:38,171 --> 02:07:40,420
Taking email nitrate and
a bunch of different,

2211
02:07:40,421 --> 02:07:45,100
like really heavy drugs that are 10
crystal meth that are devastating to your

2212
02:07:45,101 --> 02:07:49,310
immune system. Hold on. And he says that
when these people show these, uh, the,

2213
02:07:49,320 --> 02:07:49,601
their,

2214
02:07:49,601 --> 02:07:53,080
their immune system is crushed and then
they show that they have HIV in their

2215
02:07:53,081 --> 02:07:57,340
system. The reason is that their immune
system is too weak to fight off the HIV.

2216
02:07:57,460 --> 02:07:59,650
It's not that HIV has
brought them to that point.

2217
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:04,680
He said it's a variety of different
ailments that a lot of it is caused by,

2218
02:08:05,290 --> 02:08:08,560
um, by hardcore partying. Then
what's the blood transfusion

2219
02:08:10,120 --> 02:08:13,570
and careless? Well, he's,
well, first of all, he's a, um,

2220
02:08:13,660 --> 02:08:17,890
he's a very prominent scientist. I mean,
he's very well respected guy. Again,

2221
02:08:17,891 --> 02:08:20,580
he's from the, he has
tenure at the University of
California, Berkeley. I mean,

2222
02:08:20,581 --> 02:08:24,280
he's a, is Berkeley with a B or
is it like, what do you mean?

2223
02:08:24,281 --> 02:08:28,300
Like I can say correctly, spelled,
spelled silent. K Two. They're getting,

2224
02:08:28,630 --> 02:08:32,470
that's funny. Yeah. Yeah. Well, he's
a super, super controversial guy.

2225
02:08:32,650 --> 02:08:34,060
Why did they say it's reckless though?

2226
02:08:34,390 --> 02:08:39,130
Because people say he's full of Shit
and that, uh, AIDS does. Um, you know,

2227
02:08:39,131 --> 02:08:42,400
I've talked about this with Fitzsimmons
and we had this discussion and one of

2228
02:08:42,401 --> 02:08:46,390
the things that I said was that it's
really terrifying when you to fucking dumb

2229
02:08:46,391 --> 02:08:48,280
to know who's stupid,
you know,

2230
02:08:48,281 --> 02:08:52,960
like is he stupid or are the other people
that are climbing the HIV does cause

2231
02:08:52,961 --> 02:08:56,740
aids? There's no way they stupid. Maybe
he's interpretation of it. It's different.

2232
02:08:56,770 --> 02:09:01,450
I mean, it's really crazy. Um, I,
I don't, I don't know who's right,

2233
02:09:01,451 --> 02:09:04,870
but I'm going to bring him on and then
of course there'll be some people that

2234
02:09:04,871 --> 02:09:05,740
disagree with him,

2235
02:09:05,830 --> 02:09:09,220
so I'm going to want to hear from them
too and just Holler at me on Twitter and

2236
02:09:09,221 --> 02:09:11,680
we'll figure out what,
how, how to address this.

2237
02:09:11,890 --> 02:09:16,690
I all I can do when it
comes to this sort of a,

2238
02:09:16,750 --> 02:09:21,670
um, this sort of incredibly controversial
subject that I really am not qualified

2239
02:09:21,700 --> 02:09:23,200
medically to under.
I mean,

2240
02:09:23,201 --> 02:09:28,201
I don't understand the idea behind a
retro viruses and [inaudible] and HIV.

2241
02:09:29,231 --> 02:09:31,810
I don't understand it. I don't understand
the argument either way. So we'll,

2242
02:09:31,950 --> 02:09:35,620
we'll be forced to try to spell this out.

2243
02:09:35,621 --> 02:09:39,220
Mr Duisburg argument as
as cleanly as possible.

2244
02:09:39,430 --> 02:09:42,250
But of course there's a lot of
really controversial aspects to it.

2245
02:09:42,251 --> 02:09:46,630
One of the big ones being how the fuck
is it possible that something can get to

2246
02:09:46,631 --> 02:09:51,631
be this sort of mainstream accepted
belief that HIV causes AIDS when he says

2247
02:09:52,421 --> 02:09:54,040
it's Bs and what is his argument?

2248
02:09:54,041 --> 02:09:57,300
And then of course we'll get someone
else on afterwards that's a counselor,

2249
02:09:57,480 --> 02:10:00,730
whatever's initially told to them
and then they just run with it.

2250
02:10:00,731 --> 02:10:02,680
That's what politicians
had been doing forever.

2251
02:10:02,890 --> 02:10:07,210
They just put something out and then they
just, that's, it's all misinformation.

2252
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:08,500
I don't know about that.
I don't,

2253
02:10:08,501 --> 02:10:12,670
I mean I know there's a lot of scientists
who work on AIDS cures and HIV cures,

2254
02:10:12,730 --> 02:10:17,730
so I need to of course speak to someone
like that as well as Mr Duesberg.

2255
02:10:18,011 --> 02:10:21,040
And then ultimately the fucking most
awesome thing would be to have the two of

2256
02:10:21,041 --> 02:10:25,260
them together and give them
a forum after, uh, you know,

2257
02:10:25,270 --> 02:10:29,140
Duisburg podcast and then dues
someone who refutes his information.

2258
02:10:29,270 --> 02:10:33,940
Then have the two of them would get
together and then we can, Tom Tom Wrestle,

2259
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:37,460
play poker. I don't know. I think that
will be pretty fucking interesting.

2260
02:10:37,461 --> 02:10:41,120
I would like to know, I mean, if Duesberg
is right, that's a crazy thing. I mean,

2261
02:10:41,121 --> 02:10:44,030
if you think about all the nutty things
that we've already discovered about how

2262
02:10:44,031 --> 02:10:47,690
fucking goofy our culture is,
if we found out that that's the case too.

2263
02:10:48,110 --> 02:10:51,350
But again, I'm not giving out
any health advice folks. Okay.

2264
02:10:51,351 --> 02:10:52,700
Especially when it comes to diseases.

2265
02:10:52,701 --> 02:10:56,960
I'm a fucking standup comedian
slash cage fighting commentator.

2266
02:10:56,961 --> 02:10:59,960
I'm the last person you should be
listening to when it comes to information

2267
02:10:59,961 --> 02:11:03,050
about aids. So all the people that are
worried about like distributing this,

2268
02:11:03,051 --> 02:11:05,320
like this guy is a
murderer. What? He's his,

2269
02:11:05,321 --> 02:11:07,430
this information that let the guy talk.
He's,

2270
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:12,440
if he's way of fucking smarter
and more educated on this subject,

2271
02:11:12,591 --> 02:11:15,830
and most of the people that
are questioning him. So it's a,

2272
02:11:15,980 --> 02:11:20,480
I wa I re-read odd,
behold the pale horse,

2273
02:11:21,110 --> 02:11:25,720
uh, that one book that he was
talking about aids and how like it's,

2274
02:11:25,820 --> 02:11:28,420
it's government made and that guy's,

2275
02:11:28,760 --> 02:11:32,270
that Guy William Cooper is his
name. Yeah. Him and your boy.

2276
02:11:32,690 --> 02:11:37,310
Who's the other conspiracy
theories? Jones. Yeah. They
supposedly had a big like,

2277
02:11:37,640 --> 02:11:38,810
yeah. Well, you know,

2278
02:11:38,900 --> 02:11:43,340
conspiracy theorists all hate the other
conspiracy theorists like Latino comics,

2279
02:11:44,260 --> 02:11:45,180
they're like Latino.

2280
02:11:51,910 --> 02:11:53,300
Somebody just put out a picture

2281
02:11:55,070 --> 02:11:59,420
of a monkey and a fuck you looking at
Tripoli. I know. Hey, hey, hey, oh yeah.

2282
02:11:59,421 --> 02:12:00,590
A lot of those conspiracy guys,

2283
02:12:00,591 --> 02:12:03,230
they come from complained that the other
gods are idiots and that they're all

2284
02:12:03,231 --> 02:12:04,630
spewing out this information.

2285
02:12:04,780 --> 02:12:07,250
And they always claimed that the other
guy's a government agent. You know,

2286
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:09,200
they all think that everybody,
everybody's a government agent.

2287
02:12:09,201 --> 02:12:10,034
It's really interesting.

2288
02:12:10,220 --> 02:12:15,220
But that Guy William Cooper said a
lot of the shit I remember reading,

2289
02:12:15,471 --> 02:12:17,700
behold a pale horse. Is
that what it's called? Yeah.

2290
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:18,890
And I remember reading it going,

2291
02:12:18,891 --> 02:12:23,430
this guy is either crazy or he's doing
this is like some disinformation bit.

2292
02:12:23,450 --> 02:12:25,340
Well, yeah, that was the
whole theory on that too.

2293
02:12:25,341 --> 02:12:27,470
But big on aliens that
they're already here,

2294
02:12:27,730 --> 02:12:32,150
but are part of everything here.
That, and I go, come on, man,

2295
02:12:32,151 --> 02:12:36,170
you gotta give me some evidence. You can't
just say the aliens are here. You know,

2296
02:12:36,171 --> 02:12:39,140
you just, there was too much.
There's bases on the moon.

2297
02:12:39,141 --> 02:12:43,710
Aliens are and they'd show you traveled
to far galaxies and all that stuff.

2298
02:12:43,820 --> 02:12:48,230
If you've seen those arguments, the
images about basis. Yay. Let's see,

2299
02:12:48,231 --> 02:12:53,030
this was the glass tower. Like what are
you seeing that, I'm not saying it's fine.

2300
02:12:53,031 --> 02:12:55,250
Once you find what you're looking for,
there's,

2301
02:12:55,430 --> 02:12:57,830
if you Google structures on the moon,

2302
02:12:57,950 --> 02:13:01,040
you will lose all faith in human race,

2303
02:13:01,490 --> 02:13:03,500
look googled structures in the moon.

2304
02:13:03,501 --> 02:13:06,840
And these images that people
are trying to say are like,

2305
02:13:06,841 --> 02:13:11,150
like buildings and shit and you're like,
what the hell? They're talking about.

2306
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:16,070
All righty. Uh, a huge moon
base. And that one point,

2307
02:13:16,071 --> 02:13:20,360
the Russians and the Americans work
together on it and that the Russians tried

2308
02:13:20,361 --> 02:13:24,980
to take all the Americans hostages and
they had to send in some like navy seal

2309
02:13:24,981 --> 02:13:29,390
motherfuckers and it killed off 66 people.
Yeah.

2310
02:13:30,930 --> 02:13:34,590
There's people that think that the moon
is actually an alien base and then it's

2311
02:13:34,591 --> 02:13:36,180
a spaceship and a,

2312
02:13:36,250 --> 02:13:40,260
they point to the fact that we dropped
a satellite on the moon once and it rang

2313
02:13:40,261 --> 02:13:44,130
for like a day. Like it, like
it rang like it was hollow.

2314
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:49,710
It's like there's some nutty motherfuckers
been contacted from people that

2315
02:13:49,711 --> 02:13:52,890
believed that the earth is hollow. If
you ever been contacted by those people.

2316
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:57,720
Now is that the lizards
live? Um, I don't think so.

2317
02:13:57,721 --> 02:14:00,570
I think they think that there's a
whole sky in there. I'm not sure.

2318
02:14:00,571 --> 02:14:04,800
I think there's more than one group of
people when it comes to the hollow earth

2319
02:14:04,860 --> 02:14:06,990
thing. But uh, that there,

2320
02:14:06,991 --> 02:14:11,320
it was like the matrix that
there's a whole civilization
underground. Yeah. Yeah.

2321
02:14:11,321 --> 02:14:14,610
There's a whole world going on in there
inside the earth. You just got to go.

2322
02:14:14,760 --> 02:14:16,620
There's a whole,
you find you're always raving.

2323
02:14:16,650 --> 02:14:19,620
He'd go in there and just like stars
and shit. I guess they just have like,

2324
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:24,780
like a little kid has those glow in the
dark stickers. They have stars somehow.

2325
02:14:24,810 --> 02:14:27,090
I Dunno. I Dunno what the fuck
they're claiming, but it's, uh,

2326
02:14:27,380 --> 02:14:29,190
it's pretty hilarious
at this point in time.

2327
02:14:29,191 --> 02:14:32,410
How many times we have to see volcanoes
and go, oh, that's inside of it. Yeah.

2328
02:14:33,570 --> 02:14:34,600
Where does that come from?

2329
02:14:34,770 --> 02:14:37,680
Looking at a Krispy Kreme doughnut and
thinking there's diamonds in there. Look,

2330
02:14:38,280 --> 02:14:41,430
there's this cream in their stupid,
see it coming out the top? Yeah.

2331
02:14:41,431 --> 02:14:43,980
That's what's in the whole
fucking it backed up chimneys.

2332
02:14:43,981 --> 02:14:45,180
What's going on down there?

2333
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:47,500
More proof that this whole
road is not real. Joe,

2334
02:14:47,501 --> 02:14:50,830
check this at the Guardian us data.
A whistle blower.

2335
02:14:50,831 --> 02:14:54,340
It's a violation of everyone's
constitutional rights and it's the formal

2336
02:14:54,341 --> 02:14:55,990
national security agency officer.

2337
02:14:55,991 --> 02:14:59,470
It was saying how the u s is illegally
collecting huge amounts of data on his

2338
02:14:59,471 --> 02:15:00,490
fellow citizens.
Right.

2339
02:15:00,740 --> 02:15:05,290
And then the first sentence sitting in
its surroundings of an olive garden,

2340
02:15:06,150 --> 02:15:10,400
all that. So it's an uh,

2341
02:15:10,450 --> 02:15:14,330
an an olive garden too.
Is he talking about the restaurant,

2342
02:15:14,870 --> 02:15:18,040
the Nakia surroundings of an olive
garden and the Baltimore suburbs.

2343
02:15:18,060 --> 02:15:21,140
He's talking about the restaurant he
ate at the restaurant. He ate it all.

2344
02:15:21,141 --> 02:15:24,860
Garn yeah, that's the guy that we had
when we had David Seaman on the podcast.

2345
02:15:24,950 --> 02:15:26,690
Yeah, I remember that.
Congressional candidate. Yeah.

2346
02:15:26,710 --> 02:15:30,560
Vinnie is the NSA whistleblower.
He's the mathematician I know needs it.

2347
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:33,980
Olive Garden, you know, you have create
you how crazy you are with this shit.

2348
02:15:33,981 --> 02:15:36,050
You fuck you know crazy.
You are.

2349
02:15:36,051 --> 02:15:38,880
I was watching an olive garden commercial
at all I could think of is you,

2350
02:15:38,881 --> 02:15:42,860
you silly bitch, you can get free
breadsticks. I'm like fucking Brian.

2351
02:15:43,270 --> 02:15:47,480
And I'm watching the elite more for
them. Their commercials. Oh yeah,

2352
02:15:47,481 --> 02:15:50,720
he's made olive garden. A cool thing
to do, people were fans of the podcast.

2353
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:53,840
Sometimes we'll go to olive garden. Just
how to support. Where do you want to eat?

2354
02:15:53,841 --> 02:15:57,560
Well, red band likes all garden.
Let's go eat there. By the way, a,

2355
02:15:57,561 --> 02:15:59,810
I'm wearing a death squad
tee shirt, one of the, uh,

2356
02:16:00,050 --> 02:16:02,630
the new super sexy ones with a,
my favorite cat.

2357
02:16:02,631 --> 02:16:06,640
And you can get these go to desk squad.
Dot. TV and, and, and by him. And uh,

2358
02:16:06,650 --> 02:16:09,460
whenever you do something like that,
it supports a Brian's podcast.

2359
02:16:09,461 --> 02:16:12,280
Now I might put the black
cock bomb on the, on the,

2360
02:16:12,290 --> 02:16:15,710
which Sam Tripoli is a part of which
I was going to say the naughty show,

2361
02:16:15,711 --> 02:16:18,590
which is Sam's. It's we're doing tonight.
You guys doing tonight? What are you,

2362
02:16:18,591 --> 02:16:21,780
who's on it tonight? Gareth
Reynolds, the funniest fucker.

2363
02:16:21,790 --> 02:16:25,820
And a good friend of mine had a show,
has a show coming out and MTV,

2364
02:16:25,850 --> 02:16:27,830
he went to New York to shoot
until he just got back.

2365
02:16:27,831 --> 02:16:29,980
So I'm going to have him on maybe

2366
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:34,750
Dave Anthony's. Gonna come on. We're going
to talk about those. It, uh, it's, uh,

2367
02:16:34,770 --> 02:16:38,680
what's it, how comes Greinke show?
I know it's a, uh, it's called,

2368
02:16:38,830 --> 02:16:42,880
isn't it called something like laugh or
fail or it's called fail or something

2369
02:16:42,881 --> 02:16:46,480
like that. It's like some weird kind
of like, it's some Internet thing.

2370
02:16:46,481 --> 02:16:47,830
I don't even know.
He'll describe it.

2371
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:50,870
Just fails. Would fuck ups. I mean,

2372
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:54,620
think about how many traffic accidents.
It's,

2373
02:16:54,640 --> 02:16:57,700
Doug Benson had a great idea that I
need to really get on about me doing

2374
02:16:57,701 --> 02:16:59,160
commentary over Internet fight.

2375
02:16:59,310 --> 02:17:03,550
Yeah. I always wanted to do
that, dude. Just like, pick
up the, fucking find these,

2376
02:17:03,880 --> 02:17:08,560
these are hilarious videos of black chicks
swinging on each other or some of the

2377
02:17:08,590 --> 02:17:10,780
best videos you'll ever
watch in your life.

2378
02:17:10,960 --> 02:17:14,890
Yeah. And me doing it, it would be,
you know, that I would like to do that.

2379
02:17:14,891 --> 02:17:17,550
I think that'd be a perfect thing
for me because uh, you know,

2380
02:17:17,560 --> 02:17:22,560
obviously the UFC commentary background
and stand up and watching those things.

2381
02:17:22,990 --> 02:17:25,800
There's some funny fucking
Vinnie and there's so many.
You never run out of them.

2382
02:17:25,930 --> 02:17:30,430
Did you ever see the ones where the guys
fight at the Wendy's at night and it's

2383
02:17:30,431 --> 02:17:31,970
the most hilarious video you'll ever,

2384
02:17:32,140 --> 02:17:35,080
they had one recently, man.
I saw a dude head kick,

2385
02:17:35,081 --> 02:17:39,820
a meter maid and a, I think it
was an England to it. Pull it up.

2386
02:17:40,050 --> 02:17:43,600
Pull it up. Cause it's a, it's
really a show. It's called
epic fail. No, no, no, no.

2387
02:17:43,601 --> 02:17:44,920
I'll pull that up. No, no, no,

2388
02:17:44,921 --> 02:17:47,490
but I'm just saying what my
buddies shelf settle the fuck down.

2389
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:48,333
It was running this shade.

2390
02:17:50,270 --> 02:17:51,103
What the hell?

2391
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:51,870
Fuck Sam.

2392
02:17:51,870 --> 02:17:54,780
She should together this trying to see
a dude get kicked in the head and your

2393
02:17:54,781 --> 02:17:55,860
promo and your bullshit

2394
02:17:57,470 --> 02:18:01,140
man kicks man kicks
meter maid in the head.

2395
02:18:01,440 --> 02:18:04,290
I think it is dude,
just end.

2396
02:18:04,291 --> 02:18:08,670
The sad thing is that dude was skilled
like it was a real roundhouse kick.

2397
02:18:09,150 --> 02:18:13,080
He roundhouse kicked this
guy in the fucking head and
the guy just went straight.

2398
02:18:13,350 --> 02:18:16,800
Okay. I got to know who's fault. I mean
like the guy could have been an asshole,

2399
02:18:18,020 --> 02:18:22,640
a meter main or you have to
see it. You have to see it.
You say that, that's crazy.

2400
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:23,571
The,

2401
02:18:23,571 --> 02:18:28,571
if you look at it like there's no way
that guy did anything that a warranted

2402
02:18:29,660 --> 02:18:33,910
head kicks, maybe fucked
his mouth. Whoa. Um,

2403
02:18:34,010 --> 02:18:38,990
that's always a good point is always
a possibility. Dad. I'm sorry,

2404
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:43,370
I don't find it on Youtube. I looked
for a man. Karate kicks. Meter maid.

2405
02:18:43,730 --> 02:18:45,480
Well,
I got nothing better.

2406
02:18:45,940 --> 02:18:50,090

moment traffic warden is karate kicked.

2412
02:19:11,300 --> 02:19:13,440
Found it. So what we're saying, Sam,

2413
02:19:14,530 --> 02:19:18,340

just has like this crazy drug.

2414
02:19:18,341 --> 02:19:21,120
He's just swinging on people

know where this dude just like this,

2416
02:19:25,710 --> 02:19:27,920

2418
02:19:31,821 --> 02:19:36,140
everybody in the park. It's
hilarious. A horrific moment.

2419
02:19:36,410 --> 02:19:40,820
Traffic warden is karate kicked. Oh,

2420
02:19:40,821 --> 02:19:45,540
Like he's in Turkey and he like fights
the whole village do net. Yeah, we put,

2421
02:19:45,560 --> 02:19:48,200

of times when I think when bill burr

2422
02:19:48,201 --> 02:19:51,500
was on, we did it. That's a great
fight. Yeah, it was ridiculous.

2423
02:19:51,501 --> 02:19:55,720
The guy kept cracking dudes. They kept
running after him. You got it Brian too,

2424
02:19:55,730 --> 02:19:58,420
too, too too too. Can I
push you on that thing?

2425
02:19:58,970 --> 02:20:02,970
If you watch, watch this, what
happens? The guy is riding this shit.

2426
02:20:03,090 --> 02:20:06,150
They come out and they ask
him like, Hey man, why you uh,

2427
02:20:06,210 --> 02:20:09,390

2429
02:20:11,460 --> 02:20:15,990
And so he spit on him and so he said

I, that's what jails meant for people are
going to be violent like that right in

2437
02:20:48,431 --> 02:20:51,960
the middle of nowhere. Bam. Yeah,
that's a douchebag. That's there's no,

2438
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:55,110
that guy just teed off on that guy
and he kicks hard. That guy was like,

2439
02:20:55,570 --> 02:20:58,710
you could tell that was like real
technique turned his head that yeah,

2440
02:20:58,720 --> 02:21:00,460
that wasn't a guy who's
never kicked somebody before.

2441
02:21:00,610 --> 02:21:02,350
He knocked that guy out and that guy went,

2442
02:21:02,590 --> 02:21:04,900
his head went off the
concrete and that's fucking,

2443
02:21:05,110 --> 02:21:09,700
that guy could be dead and you'll probably
be fucked up for a long time for her.

2444
02:21:09,710 --> 02:21:14,500
That's that. She takes a long time to
recover from. If you survive at all,

2445
02:21:14,501 --> 02:21:16,870
your head bouncing off the
fucking concrete like that.

2446
02:21:16,900 --> 02:21:19,240
She ever see the one where
the guy pulls a prank,

2447
02:21:19,241 --> 02:21:23,700
he jumps out of the trash and the black
guy just turns around and just, yeah,

2448
02:21:23,770 --> 02:21:24,880
I love it here.
See this one?

2449
02:21:24,881 --> 02:21:26,770
I always thought this one
was the most fucked up one.

2450
02:21:26,800 --> 02:21:31,510
This is an old classic where they had
guys like horrible one. What the fuck?

2451
02:21:31,930 --> 02:21:35,140
Yeah. Horrible. I don't
know what that was about.

2452
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:39,970
How about the Russians fighting at the
pool? Yeah, that guy got fucked up.

2453
02:21:40,030 --> 02:21:41,290
But who knows what that was about?

2454
02:21:41,291 --> 02:21:44,830
Do you ever see the ones where all
the Russians for some reason in Russia

2455
02:21:44,950 --> 02:21:49,570
there's a public pool with dolphins in
it and the dolphins are swimming around

2456
02:21:49,750 --> 02:21:54,070
and you just see these crazy Russians
just starting to get in a fight outside

2457
02:21:54,130 --> 02:21:55,380
right at the pool.
Well,

2458
02:21:55,381 --> 02:21:58,570
have you ever seen Russian like gang
fights when they're like, did this,

2459
02:21:58,571 --> 02:22:02,140
these like groups of kids like meat in
this field and beat the fucking shit out

2460
02:22:02,141 --> 02:22:06,380
of each other and they literally go and
skins and shirts and it's like, you know,

2461
02:22:06,400 --> 02:22:09,240

this town. Oh, here it is.

2462
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:13,150
Oh yeah, I've seen this. Yeah.

2463
02:22:13,151 --> 02:22:17,110
It turns into a crazy fist
fight and it often pull. Ha,

2464
02:22:17,140 --> 02:22:19,720
why would anyone want to fight?
I don't often pull. Yeah,

2465
02:22:19,721 --> 02:22:23,200
here it goes and we're off.
That's scary shit too.

2466
02:22:23,201 --> 02:22:25,060
When you're in a fucking
fight in the pool.

2467
02:22:28,560 --> 02:22:32,940
Russians don't fuck around Bro.

2469
02:22:43,350 --> 02:22:48,300
This guy's just climbing up and as he
gets out and the guy talks more shit,

2470
02:22:48,330 --> 02:22:51,870

Pool. Yeah. They like to fight in Russia,

2471

02:23:09,090 --> 02:23:12,440
Last is going to get punted again. He's
just getting out. Won't Donk, donk?

2476
02:23:12,450 --> 02:23:14,430
There's a knee to the
face, son. Oh, left hook.

2477
02:23:14,431 --> 02:23:19,290
Right hand for right hand guys down in
the water. Don't get tossed in again.

2478
02:23:19,320 --> 02:23:24,120
Sprawl son. You Guys Bra. Oh Wow.
Look at it as shooting a double.

2479
02:23:24,180 --> 02:23:26,070
He's got a bad double.
It's like he's trying to suck his dick.

2480
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:30,720
The guy even looked at least claim to
suck my Dick Nigga. The guy sitting down.

2481
02:23:32,890 --> 02:23:37,740
Oh, rods are getting involved. I'm
like, Oh shit. Girl goes down. Wow.

2482
02:23:37,741 --> 02:23:41,910
That girl's scream. Wow.
That's like an alarm. Oh Dude.

2483
02:23:41,911 --> 02:23:46,110
Got kicked from a seating position.
This is ridiculous. And other girl.

2484
02:23:46,650 --> 02:23:48,650
What's up at the girls? Get
the girls out of here. Yeah,

2485
02:23:48,780 --> 02:23:53,070
the China get their flip
flops. They're like, oh,

2486
02:23:53,071 --> 02:23:55,950
in the water again, son, that's
three in a row. This is ridiculous.

2487
02:23:57,890 --> 02:24:00,480
You've got to get that rear naked choke
sign. You've got the armor on the neck.

2488
02:24:00,720 --> 02:24:02,520
Finish the job.
There's this guy in the yellow shirt.

2489
02:24:02,521 --> 02:24:05,920
He doesn't seem like he fits here guys
just hanging out. He's like, hey buddy,

2490
02:24:05,990 --> 02:24:08,160
you need to stock.
Even though these guys,

2491
02:24:08,161 --> 02:24:10,230
this is the first time I
hung out with them. Yeah,

2492
02:24:10,231 --> 02:24:13,620
you could lose all faith in humanity if
you stay on youtube or live leak long

2493
02:24:13,621 --> 02:24:15,800
enough. Well here's the police. Come on.

2494
02:24:15,830 --> 02:24:19,530
They're in Russia or there's
Bert Kreischer. Yeah,

2495
02:24:19,531 --> 02:24:22,410
Bert Kreischer hammered and come
back looking for his wallet.

2496
02:24:24,010 --> 02:24:27,810
So this guy is just, this is some,
I wonder what this is all about.

2497
02:24:27,990 --> 02:24:32,220
I know if there's any Russians Beckon
Attos that day just to stay in the water.

2498
02:24:32,221 --> 02:24:34,860
He keeps getting knocked in
the water safe in the water.

2499
02:24:34,920 --> 02:24:35,970
Well it safe in the water.

2500
02:24:35,971 --> 02:24:38,520
If you don't get knocked the fuck out
and then knocked in the water cause guess

2501
02:24:38,521 --> 02:24:42,720
what? No one's going to rescue her
down. You're going to drown, man.

2502
02:24:43,140 --> 02:24:46,770
Oh. Oh that guy was like chill.
Sudden throwing the elbow.

2503
02:24:46,771 --> 02:24:50,940
Just totally missing after the audio
listener is just a bunch of fun. Steve,

2504
02:24:50,941 --> 02:24:52,080
what is the video does name,

2505
02:24:52,081 --> 02:24:54,000
what does the name of the
video so people can watch it?

2506
02:24:54,440 --> 02:24:58,230
It's Russian dolphin fighting.
Russians brought near a dolphin,

2507
02:24:58,231 --> 02:25:01,660
Paul full and it's four
minutes and 29 seconds.

2508
02:25:03,250 --> 02:25:05,850
Love. What? A silly,

2509
02:25:07,590 --> 02:25:11,270
crazier more Jesus.

2510
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:15,550
So funny how it's like white
shirts versus black shirts. Yeah,

2511
02:25:15,870 --> 02:25:18,540
and no shirts too.
I guess they know who's who,

2512
02:25:18,810 --> 02:25:21,900
but they keep like trying to make up
and then fight again. Who's this guy?

2513
02:25:22,140 --> 02:25:24,040
This pony boy.
That's

2514
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:24,873
Chris Titus.

2515
02:25:26,320 --> 02:25:31,320
You go back to the beginning of the
video and just see how hot the chick is.

2516
02:25:31,830 --> 02:25:36,250
No enough. And know. That's
uncalled for. Come on,

2517
02:25:36,610 --> 02:25:38,440
let's go back and look
at the pretty girls.

2518
02:25:39,670 --> 02:25:44,310
That's amazing to these iTunes
listeners. True. Too. True.

2519
02:25:44,480 --> 02:25:46,690
Being silly.
There's a billion pretty girls online.

2520
02:25:46,691 --> 02:25:50,400
You need to see this blurry vision.
You can tell she's smoking.

2521
02:25:50,500 --> 02:25:53,680
You can barely see their faces. No, you
can see it in this one. The fuck up.

2522
02:25:53,681 --> 02:25:54,920
Shut the fuck you looking at carefully.

2523
02:25:54,970 --> 02:25:58,600
You want it to shell and he said you
want us to show it and then we'll decide.

2524
02:25:58,630 --> 02:26:00,790
Let's look at it again.
And I bet you can't tell at all.

2525
02:26:00,791 --> 02:26:04,150
I bet you could probably see this bitch.
How much you want bet $5 okay.

2526
02:26:04,151 --> 02:26:08,650
Go to the beginning of the video. $5
I bet it blurry is right. I bet it is.

2527
02:26:08,650 --> 02:26:12,850
Blurry sites, dollars riding
on this shit. Winner, winner,

2528
02:26:12,851 --> 02:26:16,930
chicken dinner. Very excited about
Toronto this weekend. Sam trip. I am too.

2529
02:26:17,350 --> 02:26:21,430
We get in Thursday night and there's
allegedly a place where you can allegedly

2530
02:26:21,431 --> 02:26:25,600
smoke marijuana while you allegedly
have a comedy show. At the same time.

2531
02:26:25,960 --> 02:26:30,020
I need to find out what the laws are. I've
allegedly done standup at that legend.

2532
02:26:30,050 --> 02:26:33,130
No, no, no, no. Nonsense
craziness. You've never been there.

2533
02:26:34,960 --> 02:26:36,190
Arch fear might be joining us.

2534
02:26:36,370 --> 02:26:40,120
It's all depending on whether or not
he's contractually obligated to say he

2535
02:26:40,121 --> 02:26:42,150
can't. Oh, that's right.

2536
02:26:42,490 --> 02:26:45,850
Well it's just for laughs is also
promoting my show up there as well.

2537
02:26:45,851 --> 02:26:48,310
It's all taking place
during the comedy festival,

2538
02:26:48,311 --> 02:26:50,440
so we're doing Massey hall on Friday,

2539
02:26:50,680 --> 02:26:55,380
which is super duper fucking awesome. Did
you do a Massey Hall with me last time?

2540
02:26:55,850 --> 02:26:58,750
So sick. Yeah, it was a
great time to is phenomenal.

2541
02:26:58,810 --> 02:27:01,780
It's Doug Benson going to be there.
I don't think he's in Canada that week,

2542
02:27:01,781 --> 02:27:05,830
but he is going to be at the ice house
Wednesday night. Dad's, Doug Benson, dom,

2543
02:27:05,831 --> 02:27:08,860
I rera, Greg Fitzsimmons, Duncan Trussell,

2544
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:12,940
Brian Red Ban and me.
Can I promote where he did his show?

2545
02:27:12,941 --> 02:27:15,430
He is to promote the shit out of it.
Sam trevally.

2546
02:27:15,460 --> 02:27:20,460
September 26 the noughties show presents
the 2012 searchlight model finale by

2547
02:27:22,001 --> 02:27:25,710
fleshlight whites. A searchlight
for now. A model. Well yeah.

2548
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:29,710
What do you like the
American idol of sex toys.

2549
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:31,180
So you,

2550
02:27:31,181 --> 02:27:35,220
a bunch of girls dance around and then
they decide which one gets a flashlight

2551
02:27:35,230 --> 02:27:38,050
on. You been having like voting's
been going on for like a month.

2552
02:27:38,200 --> 02:27:40,470
Do they have to see their pussy? Do
they have to show that? Cause you,

2553
02:27:40,500 --> 02:27:43,240
you should really know like what
if it's a training, any wins.

2554
02:27:43,720 --> 02:27:48,220
We need to set these big name girls
there. Oh, I saw Alexis, Texas,

2555
02:27:48,900 --> 02:27:53,170
Kayden Kross and this girl with the grace
name a fixie out. No War is her name.

2556
02:27:53,290 --> 02:27:57,910
Alexis Texas is one of those girls
who could never make it on a sitcom.

2557
02:27:58,090 --> 02:28:02,260
Never make it like in the, the the like
the movie version of what you know,

2558
02:28:02,530 --> 02:28:04,260
super skinny girls so
people think is high,

2559
02:28:04,420 --> 02:28:07,240
but dude's look at that girl's ass and go

2560
02:28:09,400 --> 02:28:12,970
crazy for that. Yeah. A lot of girls
would be like, oh, she's too big or she's,

2561
02:28:13,300 --> 02:28:15,580
they'll fuck outta here.
That's not what dudes thing.

2562
02:28:15,700 --> 02:28:19,300
They look at that big giant
juicy ass and go, holy fuck.

2563
02:28:19,330 --> 02:28:20,530
I wonder if she's insured.

2564
02:28:20,531 --> 02:28:25,531
It let people like and what like the
media is image of what is hot is like,

2565
02:28:26,181 --> 02:28:27,170
is this a little off?

2566
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:31,460
I tell girls all the time to stop
letting television and magazines tell you

2567
02:28:31,461 --> 02:28:35,970
what's sexy guys don't like that.
Guys like me on the bone. It's, yeah,

2568
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:38,510
there's something about
a girl who's like really,

2569
02:28:38,511 --> 02:28:42,320
really like lean and
skinny and like six packy.

2570
02:28:42,530 --> 02:28:44,810
It says something a
little weird about that.

2571
02:28:44,811 --> 02:28:49,811
Where's the girls got like 10
pounds more honor than she needs.

2572
02:28:49,980 --> 02:28:54,440
Z androgyny is what? I can't like these
supermodels, they're not even hot anymore.

2573
02:28:54,590 --> 02:28:57,500
Well you know that's all designed like
the idea of supermodels or reason why

2574
02:28:57,501 --> 02:29:00,860
they were like really tall and thin. It's
so clothes look good on them. So close,

2575
02:29:00,861 --> 02:29:03,680
sorta lay on them and you've got a
chance to really see the clothes.

2576
02:29:03,890 --> 02:29:07,160
Whereas like you put light but
you come way back in the day.

2577
02:29:07,161 --> 02:29:10,370
We put some clothes on a girl with big
giant tits and a big ass and all you're

2578
02:29:10,371 --> 02:29:12,270
seeing is that big giant
tits and the big ass.

2579
02:29:13,120 --> 02:29:15,930
Any Crawford was hot back in the
day and she was the supermind.

2580
02:29:16,100 --> 02:29:21,050
Now they're all just so in. They look like
heroin addicts. I don't pay attention.

2581
02:29:21,300 --> 02:29:23,680
Not Looking at model magazine.
Sam, what the fuck are you doing?

2582
02:29:23,740 --> 02:29:27,260
This is some major pieces of
his life when he, he's always,

2583
02:29:28,120 --> 02:29:31,160
I can't say, I'm not trying to
drag you up to the 21st century

2584
02:29:32,710 --> 02:29:36,650
Russian chicks in dolphin fighting videos
trying to make you a part of today.

2585
02:29:36,651 --> 02:29:38,690
Sam,
I to come apart today,

2586
02:29:38,840 --> 02:29:41,990
bring you up to the now I'm writing a lot.

2587
02:29:42,050 --> 02:29:44,810
Working hard are stopping.
Listen man,

2588
02:29:44,811 --> 02:29:47,930
it's important that we all give each
other shit about that. No, I know.

2589
02:29:47,940 --> 02:29:52,200
It's got to be inspired. You know
we bought Xoom shitty new shit in a,

2590
02:29:52,201 --> 02:29:55,460
a big show like yours while
it's only shitty new shit,

2591
02:29:55,461 --> 02:29:59,360
if you decide that you're writing shitty
stuff. Brian opened up with a fucking,

2592
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:04,550
not opened up but he did a whole new bit
in front of 1200 people in a sold out

2593
02:30:04,551 --> 02:30:08,360
show and it killed my first time doing
it. First Time doing that. Right.

2594
02:30:08,570 --> 02:30:12,260
You know why? Cause he's got
boss. Don't even say that.

2595
02:30:12,890 --> 02:30:15,830
My whole thing is false.
I'll set the place on fire.

2596
02:30:16,190 --> 02:30:18,660
You say that and we say that but yet you,

2597
02:30:18,670 --> 02:30:23,670
you feel like your new stuff is just
like never said that said I want to,

2598
02:30:24,510 --> 02:30:27,530
don't want to, I mean allium
dude, I write in volume.

2599
02:30:27,531 --> 02:30:31,550
I'm always throwing stuff against the
wall and sometimes I only find it funny.

2600
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:35,600
So if you write 10 new bits,
I'm happy if three or four of them are,

2601
02:30:35,660 --> 02:30:38,450
are good crushers, meet you. Let me too.

2602
02:30:38,750 --> 02:30:42,440
So I don't want to try that
other six in, in, in a sh show,

2603
02:30:42,441 --> 02:30:44,690
like a theater show we're
doing here at the ice house.

2604
02:30:44,691 --> 02:30:46,910
I'll throw garbage and
just see what works.

2605
02:30:46,911 --> 02:30:51,890
So what you're saying is you just,
when you get to like a theater show,

2606
02:30:51,891 --> 02:30:55,160
there's no fucking around.
You just get to business,

2607
02:30:55,250 --> 02:30:59,720
bang it out as much as possible.
I think it's, I think for you,

2608
02:30:59,721 --> 02:31:03,290
maybe you could work it, but for me,
I think they're, they're, they're,

2609
02:31:03,291 --> 02:31:06,710
they have a shell. I'm there to get
them going, set them up. I mean,

2610
02:31:06,711 --> 02:31:08,030
you could just walk out and crush,

2611
02:31:08,031 --> 02:31:12,800
but I feel like my job is to get them
really rocking. So when you come up,

2612
02:31:12,801 --> 02:31:17,801
it's a supercross involving me in fucking
decisions that becoming an enabler

2613
02:31:18,390 --> 02:31:20,880
here. Not at all. Um, I, uh,

2614
02:31:20,881 --> 02:31:25,790
I vote like Ari and I had
this conversation once and
uh, you know, he was like, uh,

2615
02:31:26,070 --> 02:31:28,820
you know, we'll sort of do, should I
go up and do my best stuff? I says,

2616
02:31:28,840 --> 02:31:30,540
who gives a fuck it do
whatever you want to do,

2617
02:31:30,870 --> 02:31:35,040
I guess is your time when you're up there
20 minutes for half an hour. I mean,

2618
02:31:35,041 --> 02:31:37,290
I wouldn't want you to flatline,
but you don't want to flat line,

2619
02:31:37,540 --> 02:31:41,700
flat line of purpose. And there's
nothing wrong with like taking chances.

2620
02:31:41,910 --> 02:31:43,500
I don't know.
I just find it like,

2621
02:31:44,720 --> 02:31:47,400
I don't know when people are playing that
kind of money that they want to show,

2622
02:31:47,580 --> 02:31:51,570
they do want to show, but that's part of
a live show. Sometimes shit goes wrong.

2623
02:31:51,750 --> 02:31:55,290
There's nothing wrong with that. It's you
can get out of it. You're a fucking pro.

2624
02:31:55,291 --> 02:31:57,420
You've been doing comedy
for almost two decades.

2625
02:31:57,630 --> 02:32:00,350
You can pull yourself out of
any downward spiral. You know?

2626
02:32:00,550 --> 02:32:03,540
It's not like you can't like
open up and fuck around,

2627
02:32:03,660 --> 02:32:07,200
but with reo is like you can't get
fired, so just go fuck around. Right.

2628
02:32:07,230 --> 02:32:09,570
It doesn't matter. It's like you're
going to have a good set. No,

2629
02:32:09,571 --> 02:32:11,360
I totally understand that.
And that's the,

2630
02:32:11,460 --> 02:32:15,310
I think that's the sort of mindset that
you have to have to do like wild standup.

2631
02:32:15,390 --> 02:32:17,250
Right. You know when you,
when you play it safe,

2632
02:32:17,460 --> 02:32:20,430
the problem with playing it safe is
you have that mentality of planet. Say,

2633
02:32:20,460 --> 02:32:25,380
I've never played it safe. That's kind of
why I am who I am. That is who you are,

2634
02:32:25,381 --> 02:32:28,560
who you are. What are you Jesse? James
Motherfucker. I told, look, gangster

2635
02:32:30,100 --> 02:32:34,920
Duncan fire. That's how I am ma'am.
It Papa. That's what I do. I do it.

2636
02:32:34,950 --> 02:32:38,580
Slash. Uh, what was the girl? I don't
know. Maybe. I just think theater shows.

2637
02:32:38,581 --> 02:32:42,200
I meant to bring the heat from the
wood. Of course you do. You still,

2638
02:32:42,570 --> 02:32:46,080
everybody should bring the heat. What was
it? Was that girl not jewel 80 per cow.

2639
02:32:46,830 --> 02:32:50,610
You're either eating for Keller.
Popeye. Yeah. I'm bringing the woods.

2640
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:54,960
That's who I am bringing the who brings
the woods. You'll bring in the wood. Yeah.

2641
02:32:54,990 --> 02:32:58,530
What does that even mean? Bringing
the back. I'm bringing the woe.

2642
02:32:58,531 --> 02:33:03,030
You bring it to bat baseball term.
I understand my name,

2643
02:33:03,031 --> 02:33:06,480
my new album that you guys are both very
funny in Sacramento was fucking awesome.

2644
02:33:06,540 --> 02:33:10,140
It was a great show, man. Yeah,
those crowds are a amazingly awesome.

2645
02:33:10,170 --> 02:33:12,240
They're like the nicest fucking
people in the history of the world.

2646
02:33:12,241 --> 02:33:15,720
It's the weirdest thing and we keep
harping on it and saying how much we

2647
02:33:15,721 --> 02:33:17,970
appreciate it, but just because
we're all blown away by it,

2648
02:33:18,330 --> 02:33:19,440
I've never had a nicer crowds.

2649
02:33:19,470 --> 02:33:23,790
So we talk about the woman who got
mad at you about bees yet. Jesus,

2650
02:33:24,190 --> 02:33:29,100
I got a picture of her crazy Vegan
lady got mad cause I was making fun.

2651
02:33:29,290 --> 02:33:33,800
Upbeat. She was vegan cheese.
You said she was, what?

2652
02:33:33,810 --> 02:33:38,130
Was she vegan or who she was as people
got mad on other people's behalfs no,

2653
02:33:38,131 --> 02:33:41,010
she was, I was talking about
the whole thing about being,

2654
02:33:41,011 --> 02:33:45,030
one of the things that's most silly about
vegans is the ones who won't eat honey

2655
02:33:45,150 --> 02:33:47,310
cause they don't want bees to be enslaved.
So I go,

2656
02:33:47,370 --> 02:33:51,990
I have this giant fucking bit about bees
and includes like real facts about bees.

2657
02:33:51,991 --> 02:33:55,710
It's hilarious. I can't wait to do it
again. Can we do a Wednesday night,

2658
02:33:55,711 --> 02:34:00,390
the ice house or Friday night
in Massey Hall in Toronto.
Um, but anyway, this lady,

2659
02:34:00,391 --> 02:34:04,110
it was like all vegan doubt and she got
fucking really bummed out at my, my,

2660
02:34:04,470 --> 02:34:08,670
my lack of respect of B's. She's
walked out. She was shit face too.

2661
02:34:08,800 --> 02:34:12,000
And people will tell you like, you know
bs really are important man. Yeah, I know.

2662
02:34:12,100 --> 02:34:15,390
Guess what? I have no bearing on
whether or not bees live or die.

2663
02:34:15,720 --> 02:34:18,000
I'm just doing comedy.
You fuckhead

2664
02:34:18,270 --> 02:34:20,710
well take, just to get
mad at that. It's like,

2665
02:34:20,740 --> 02:34:24,220
does this lady get mad every time she
watches a movie and someone gets shot and

2666
02:34:24,221 --> 02:34:24,581
killed?

2667
02:34:24,581 --> 02:34:28,540
Like does she really think that person
got shot and killed or the director

2668
02:34:28,541 --> 02:34:32,140
really wants that person to get shot and
killed. It's like, why is it with comedy?

2669
02:34:32,141 --> 02:34:34,600
They take it so literally.
It's not they,

2670
02:34:34,690 --> 02:34:38,800
it's just a few dummies and
they have 1200 people in a room.

2671
02:34:38,801 --> 02:34:39,460
You're going to get a few

2672
02:34:39,460 --> 02:34:42,650
dummies. She also said to
you, she was mad at you for,

2673
02:34:42,680 --> 02:34:46,730
for Liking Sarah Pailin
though. So I was like, wait,

2674
02:34:46,731 --> 02:34:50,120
I think maybe you are drunk and a,
you shouldn't be that.

2675
02:34:50,600 --> 02:34:54,320
Her sister was hot and I don't say that.
I like Sarah Palin. I say Sarah Palin.

2676
02:34:54,321 --> 02:34:57,800
It's just a misinformed Dominique
is probably a nice person, you know?

2677
02:34:57,830 --> 02:35:01,100
She's probably not a bad person.
There's really not that much bad on her.

2678
02:35:01,190 --> 02:35:03,730
Her ideas are stupid,
but there's a lot of people too,

2679
02:35:03,750 --> 02:35:06,020
but ideas and you could probably drink
with them and have a good time and

2680
02:35:06,021 --> 02:35:10,880
they're fine, you know, that's all
I said. Silly bitch of the clock.

2681
02:35:11,250 --> 02:35:12,560
Me Out was five.

2682
02:35:12,800 --> 02:35:16,850
She probably was just super attracted
to you and just get so angry.

2683
02:35:16,851 --> 02:35:19,220
Well she's probably attracted to you and
she knew you could, she couldn't get.

2684
02:35:19,221 --> 02:35:22,360
Yeah, so she decided to turn it
on me. Oh well that happens a lot.

2685
02:35:22,361 --> 02:35:26,580
I wish I could do that. Happens a lot.
Henry Middle Eastern looking motherfucker.

2686
02:35:27,380 --> 02:35:28,570
She was still shit face.

2687
02:35:29,150 --> 02:35:32,540
She was talking to me and red
band before she succumbed off.

2688
02:35:32,541 --> 02:35:37,450
Not knowing that we were in the show.
She just, she just talking shit. Solace.

2689
02:35:38,390 --> 02:35:39,340
Oh Susie.
That's right.

2690
02:35:39,500 --> 02:35:43,130
Well why don't you just close
the deal right there in the
hallway. Oh, I remember.

2691
02:35:43,131 --> 02:35:44,090
I tried to kiss her.

2692
02:35:47,640 --> 02:35:50,180
You have the worst Karma ever.

2693
02:35:50,360 --> 02:35:54,560
If it comes to like girls being open
to seeing how far can it go with it.

2694
02:35:54,620 --> 02:35:58,010
Girls Fall in love with though. I love
that though. Let me kiss you. That's, uh,

2695
02:35:58,040 --> 02:36:00,740
just put it out there. Well,
if you say to a girl like that,

2696
02:36:00,741 --> 02:36:03,590
she might just stab you and I know what
the fuck was going on in that girl's

2697
02:36:03,591 --> 02:36:05,870
head. You're playing with, you're
playing with a wild animal,

2698
02:36:05,900 --> 02:36:09,140
but that's why he's attracted to, Oh,
you attracted to it like crazy bitches.

2699
02:36:09,330 --> 02:36:11,760
What did you just ask that?
How long have you known Brad?

2700
02:36:11,870 --> 02:36:14,390
I'm trying to get them to talk. Okay.
Fuck is wrong with you. Cock blocker.

2701
02:36:14,750 --> 02:36:18,380
Jesus Christ. Here's her, her. Here's
that girl by the way. Ruined up though.

2702
02:36:19,580 --> 02:36:23,720
It's sideways. That's her face
melting. What's going on with that?

2703
02:36:23,930 --> 02:36:27,530
And when you eat a lot of carrots,
sometimes you face can just fall off.

2704
02:36:29,020 --> 02:36:31,970
Crazy. Silly pitch. There's
a lot of them out there.

2705
02:36:31,971 --> 02:36:34,580
She's probably going to sue
you now though. Huh? Now
she doesn't have a Twitter.

2706
02:36:34,880 --> 02:36:36,680
She doesn't have a Twitter,
but she's going to hear about this man.

2707
02:36:37,100 --> 02:36:39,280
She had friends at the show.
I'm sure they got mad and she,

2708
02:36:39,500 --> 02:36:43,300
no, she works out in like a UFC gym,
right? Yeah. Did she say that? Yeah.

2709
02:36:43,720 --> 02:36:45,660
Well she needs bees.
Julie.

2710
02:36:45,900 --> 02:36:48,970
I'm really bummed out fucking
some shit from everybody.

2711
02:36:48,980 --> 02:36:52,330
Fucking bees across her
sister was hot lead,

2712
02:36:52,331 --> 02:36:56,200
just a fat tats all over her tits.
She had fantastic.

2713
02:36:56,260 --> 02:37:00,780
Yeah. Just up to big fat tat over big
fat tick. What was the tattoo off?

2714
02:37:01,030 --> 02:37:05,940
It's always a heart with some kind of
angel wings with some kind of like, uh,

2715
02:37:06,330 --> 02:37:10,720
uh, I dunno. Shrubbery
shrubberies Hardy's pubic hair.

2716
02:37:11,320 --> 02:37:15,380
That's always like some leaves and
shit. Right. What's with the leaves?

2717
02:37:15,590 --> 02:37:20,290
There's always like some kind of
thorns or something. My heart fly,

2718
02:37:20,310 --> 02:37:25,310
but it's in a cage that's
just saying Ron fucking run.

2719
02:37:27,380 --> 02:37:30,350
Did you, what do you, what do you
know about this Julian Assange case?

2720
02:37:30,351 --> 02:37:34,530
Do you know about this at all? Is
that this guy? The founder? Yeah.

2721
02:37:34,531 --> 02:37:38,850
That he put out a bunch of, uh,
classified documents. Right.

2722
02:37:39,020 --> 02:37:42,830
And they're trying to,
they're trying to send him to Sweden.

2723
02:37:43,320 --> 02:37:47,060
I tried on some sort of a
sexual assault trial. Well,

2724
02:37:47,061 --> 02:37:51,020
the latest is that there's no DNA,
uh,

2725
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:54,270
the link in the condom to,
uh,

2726
02:37:54,680 --> 02:37:57,990
that's central to their sexual
assault case. There's no DNA. Lincoln,

2727
02:37:58,010 --> 02:38:00,920
it might not even be him.
The whole thing is amazing.

2728
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:04,160
The guys held up at the Ecuador embassy
and they're talking about storming the

2729
02:38:04,161 --> 02:38:08,990
NSC and the, the premise is this case,
this case, this sexual assault case,

2730
02:38:09,290 --> 02:38:11,600
and now the,
the latest is that a,

2731
02:38:11,601 --> 02:38:14,900
a a condom given the Swedish police
by one of the Julian Assange,

2732
02:38:14,901 --> 02:38:19,901
his accuser does not contain the wikileaks
founders DNA forensic evidence have

2733
02:38:19,941 --> 02:38:24,500
found and they reportedly found and
the banks have cut off any funding to

2734
02:38:24,501 --> 02:38:29,330
wikileaks. They, you can no longer donate
to keep it going. And it's all, yeah,

2735
02:38:29,331 --> 02:38:33,800
that makes sense. It's a smear
campaign. He likes us a smear campaign.

2736
02:38:33,801 --> 02:38:37,280
They're trying to just like squish
this guy up on Jack Em. I mean,

2737
02:38:37,281 --> 02:38:38,480
who knows what they're gonna do to them.

2738
02:38:38,630 --> 02:38:41,240
If they decided to put them in a
Swedish jail, he's probably dead.

2739
02:38:41,390 --> 02:38:44,380
They'll probably kill them, you know,
they'll just, they'll just have, you know,

2740
02:38:44,390 --> 02:38:46,220
some prison uprising,

2741
02:38:46,430 --> 02:38:50,160
let some dudes into his jail and give
them free cigarettes if they've stumped

2742
02:38:50,161 --> 02:38:54,270
him to death. I mean it's to bring the
wood, he's going to bring the wood,

2743
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:59,000
like that scene in breaking bad.
And you ever seen like the last,

2744
02:38:59,350 --> 02:39:03,620
the are you giving spoilers from
breaking bad? Don't do that.

2745
02:39:03,820 --> 02:39:07,530
What the fuck? Not My podcast buddy.
Not this one. I my podcast. All right,

2746
02:39:07,550 --> 02:39:09,920
I'll just sit here quietly.
Shut the fuck up.

2747
02:39:09,921 --> 02:39:14,921
Sam's know about balls are all about
balls and monkey and bringing wood.

2748
02:39:15,950 --> 02:39:18,260
Um,
I gotta apologize to Mac Danzig.

2749
02:39:18,290 --> 02:39:21,410
Mack Danzig did a podcast with
me and the beginning of it,

2750
02:39:21,440 --> 02:39:26,030
I got the audio of it and it, um,
it wasn't going up on the audio,

2751
02:39:26,031 --> 02:39:29,480
wasn't going up to Ustream for
[inaudible]. Brian was there. And so the,

2752
02:39:29,620 --> 02:39:32,480
the second part of it, well, I'm saying
it wasn't your fault, it was my fault.

2753
02:39:32,750 --> 02:39:35,780
And then the second part of it that
the file's corrupt. So it's fucking,

2754
02:39:35,990 --> 02:39:40,100
what's really crazy is Mac Danzig had
the same problem with Ari Shaffir.

2755
02:39:40,101 --> 02:39:43,170
He did a podcast with Ari
Shaffir is haunted and yeah, and,

2756
02:39:43,171 --> 02:39:48,050
and Ari had the podcast and deleted it
accidentally and then emptied his trash

2757
02:39:48,230 --> 02:39:50,690
and then freaked out that he couldn't
get it back. Even tried to bring to,

2758
02:39:50,960 --> 02:39:53,000
I think he tried to use
like a data finding program,

2759
02:39:53,210 --> 02:39:58,010
but the point is Mac Danzig might be
haunted when it comes to podcasts.

2760
02:39:58,080 --> 02:40:00,860
We're going to make it up to him and he's
going to come back in on things random

2761
02:40:01,460 --> 02:40:03,880
fucking with them actually,
you know, he doesn't,

2762
02:40:04,040 --> 02:40:06,920
he knows it would come in to punch me,
but he's a super inch.

2763
02:40:06,921 --> 02:40:10,310
He's a super interesting guy, so it'll
be fun to talk to them again anyway.

2764
02:40:10,580 --> 02:40:14,160
He's a really good, really good fight
coming up. Does it? He does. Isn't

2765
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:17,560
even find somebody a, I thought it
was a really good match up. Yeah.

2766
02:40:18,970 --> 02:40:22,330
I want to say it's a Japanese fighter.
Oh yeah, it is gummy tucking away goes.

2767
02:40:22,340 --> 02:40:25,220
Yeah, that's a good fight. Great.
Fine. Yeah. Yeah. He's fine.

2768
02:40:25,250 --> 02:40:28,320
A saccharine to two of the great. Um, uh,

2769
02:40:28,380 --> 02:40:31,460
Japanese fighters are sac
saccharine and Tucking Origami.

2770
02:40:31,470 --> 02:40:34,840
The great fighters of the, especially
with the last generation, you know,

2771
02:40:34,870 --> 02:40:38,330
and go me stills, big knockout puncher.
It's knocked out Tyson Griffin.

2772
02:40:38,340 --> 02:40:42,120
Shorter arms though, right? I think
that's what I've seen with Asians,

2773
02:40:42,210 --> 02:40:44,610
that they tend to have to shorter arms,
do racism.

2774
02:40:44,611 --> 02:40:47,520
When you were talking
to USC on my podcast,

2775
02:40:47,521 --> 02:40:49,860
Sam tripled none of a bitch.

2776
02:40:49,880 --> 02:40:53,970
He's going for the cheap laugh and
making fun of the Asians arm length.

2777
02:40:54,170 --> 02:40:56,700
Yes.
I'm saying that's a big reason why.

2778
02:40:57,090 --> 02:40:59,310
Okay. Who's that basketball player?
What's his name? Jeremy Lin.

2779
02:40:59,900 --> 02:41:01,410
The you're fucking your arguments.

2780
02:41:01,550 --> 02:41:06,320
The wind. No, but I'll tell you about
a Yo Ming. He looks like a t rex.

2781
02:41:06,410 --> 02:41:10,580
He's tall with these huge legs. He's
got short, shorter arms. Fuck up.

2782
02:41:10,581 --> 02:41:14,960
He does not have short arms.
Arms. No, he doesn't. Not for his.

2783
02:41:14,961 --> 02:41:17,700
Bottle him up. Brian. Pull them
up. Pull them up full. Okay,

2784
02:41:17,860 --> 02:41:20,480
now I'm going for three for three.
You're going to go down.

2785
02:41:20,690 --> 02:41:23,630
You're going to go down with this one.
This one. I swear to God. I'm telling you,

2786
02:41:23,631 --> 02:41:26,240
I've watched this guy play
basketball forever. He's not.

2787
02:41:26,241 --> 02:41:30,380
His arms are proportional to his
body. Like Blake Griffin. I'm telling,

2788
02:41:30,381 --> 02:41:33,800
having super long arms. You are no
judge of symmetry and human beings.

2789
02:41:35,240 --> 02:41:39,030
I watch, I learn. I love [inaudible].

2790
02:41:39,430 --> 02:41:41,320
I bring the wood.
I bring the wood.

2791
02:41:44,170 --> 02:41:48,190
Yo, Ming is yelling. Which one
is the, the really tall guys.

2792
02:41:48,820 --> 02:41:51,190
He's the biggest guy. Yeah,
he's, he was the seven.

2793
02:41:51,191 --> 02:41:54,700
Six Guy said he's seven foot seven.
That seems like pretty

2794
02:41:54,820 --> 02:41:59,330
decent. No, but you're Scott,
right? Shut the fuck up. Sam. Sam,

2795
02:41:59,920 --> 02:42:02,620
Sam, Sam, Sam. That is,

2796
02:42:04,070 --> 02:42:05,700
or that guy is in proportion.

2797
02:42:05,730 --> 02:42:08,790
There's nothing is proportionate
about his build at all.

2798
02:42:09,480 --> 02:42:11,620
You're so silly now.

2799
02:42:11,640 --> 02:42:14,970
I can't listen to you and trust you
on anything because we've got clear

2800
02:42:15,060 --> 02:42:19,710
photographic evidence that shows you
your shitty theory is no good and you're,

2801
02:42:19,860 --> 02:42:22,740
you're rejecting it. You're rejecting in
front of all these people on the inside.

2802
02:42:22,800 --> 02:42:27,110
Yes I am. I'm saying that
only that very short on your,

2803
02:42:27,620 --> 02:42:31,970
the fuck he does sound. You're wrong.
Sam. This is the shit observation.

2804
02:42:32,180 --> 02:42:35,780
I wish you'd brings observation on stage
and have people stare at you and go, no,

2805
02:42:36,250 --> 02:42:40,560
no. He doesn't know. You know,
it's like, crowd is nice.

2806
02:42:41,320 --> 02:42:44,610
You can say like, lady Gaga has a big
nose and people go, you know what?

2807
02:42:44,611 --> 02:42:46,860
She's done. She's really hot, but
she does kind of have a big nose.

2808
02:42:46,980 --> 02:42:48,960
You cannot say y'all oming is short arms.

2809
02:42:49,190 --> 02:42:54,130
Do the scouting report of Y'all Maine
coming into the draft and they will say

2810
02:42:54,250 --> 02:42:57,790
tall guy.
We short proportionally shorter arms.

2811
02:42:58,770 --> 02:43:01,820
Awesome.
How do you spell me?

2812
02:43:02,910 --> 02:43:07,910
Why a Oh Maine and I end machine
proportionately short on pro pour tea.

2813
02:43:12,670 --> 02:43:15,790
Short arms.
Let's say.

2814
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:23,710
How good would yell Ming be
if his arms were longer? Yeah,

2815
02:43:23,860 --> 02:43:28,240
arms are pretty short for his height,
but he still has one of the highest.

2816
02:43:29,190 --> 02:43:31,270
Okay.
This is inside hoops.

2817
02:43:33,430 --> 02:43:36,280
They're too short for his height.
Are you serious?

2818
02:43:36,350 --> 02:43:40,660
Yes. Give me back my point. Let me see.

2819
02:43:41,330 --> 02:43:44,750
I need to see some more photos of
him cause that looked normal to me.

2820
02:43:45,820 --> 02:43:50,500
That look normal. This can be just
some racist bullshit. When he got,

2821
02:43:50,510 --> 02:43:54,580
when he was getting drafted.
Date said that his arms long

2822
02:43:56,800 --> 02:43:58,780
man. Brian, I think we
need to Google. Yeah.

2823
02:43:58,840 --> 02:44:02,740
Yo Ming. Uh, images.
Y'All Ming short arms.

2824
02:44:03,130 --> 02:44:04,940
Yeah.
What are you going to eyeball it?

2825
02:44:05,260 --> 02:44:07,360
Yes and no.
I don't trust all these racists on wine.

2826
02:44:07,720 --> 02:44:12,470
Shit. What's up to the giant Chinese
man? hoops.com is a racist web.

2827
02:44:12,640 --> 02:44:16,450
Clearly they know what
kind of man. No, take away.

2828
02:44:16,690 --> 02:44:18,210
Nobody said China,
man.

2829
02:44:18,640 --> 02:44:20,210
I'm measuring.

2830
02:44:22,220 --> 02:44:26,240
It is correct that using this measure
yells arms are proportionally shorter than

2831
02:44:26,241 --> 02:44:31,190
the average. This is another one.
This is Yao Ming Mania. Okay.

2832
02:44:31,191 --> 02:44:35,330
No, no, no. This is just
a forum. Chantel. Yeah.

2833
02:44:36,260 --> 02:44:40,910
How long are y'all means arms wiki
answers seven foot. Six inches.

2834
02:44:41,120 --> 02:44:44,330
Wow. That's pretty long. You
could really say those are short.

2835
02:44:45,080 --> 02:44:48,700
Do this seven foot, six inch
arms. That's crazy. Well,

2836
02:44:48,710 --> 02:44:53,420
isn't that always the case that your
reach is like exactly. No, it's not. No.

2837
02:44:53,421 --> 02:44:56,930
There's some guys who have,
just like a lot of these NBA players now,

2838
02:44:57,110 --> 02:45:02,110
they have these incredibly long length
long reaches a guy named like Elton brand

2839
02:45:02,121 --> 02:45:06,080
who's six, five but he has
a seven to wingspan. Right.

2840
02:45:06,081 --> 02:45:07,460
That's like the same thing with Jon Jones.

2841
02:45:07,461 --> 02:45:11,120
Jon Jones is six four but he's got a
wingspan of like a seven foot tall guy.

2842
02:45:11,360 --> 02:45:12,290
The what is that?

2843
02:45:12,320 --> 02:45:16,640
Is that like an extra wide shoulders
that propelled the arms out or is it the

2844
02:45:16,641 --> 02:45:21,230
arm actually is longer. I think they
probably a little both. A little.

2845
02:45:21,231 --> 02:45:22,250
Both.
Yeah,

2846
02:45:22,251 --> 02:45:25,130
because dudes who have short shoulders
definitely always have like a shorter

2847
02:45:25,131 --> 02:45:29,270
reach. And guys like Tommy Hearns
where like real wide backs, you know,

2848
02:45:29,271 --> 02:45:32,870
had a longer reach on top of the fact
that he was tall and had long limbs.

2849
02:45:32,871 --> 02:45:36,950
This guy that just got drafted, number
one, Anthony Davis, his wingspan,

2850
02:45:36,951 --> 02:45:41,000
it's like a terror dactyl it's huge.
Did I think you get a point for that?

2851
02:45:41,001 --> 02:45:42,720
I think we've got to
give a point back to AAA.

2852
02:45:42,770 --> 02:45:44,480
I think you already did
you already give it to me.

2853
02:45:44,481 --> 02:45:48,350
I'll be going to give him a ding.
They'll give him a dang.

2854
02:45:48,890 --> 02:45:53,510
But the thing,
I'll take it then because yeah.

2855
02:45:53,570 --> 02:45:54,800
Um, the, um,

2856
02:45:55,520 --> 02:45:59,150
people online are saying that
and there's no like experts,

2857
02:45:59,330 --> 02:46:01,580
but enough people in our line
of saying it that I would see.

2858
02:46:02,140 --> 02:46:05,450
And that's why when I go
me is a great fighter.

2859
02:46:05,480 --> 02:46:10,190
I just think he has a
short reach. Yeah. Well,

2860
02:46:10,190 --> 02:46:11,460
he's uh, he, um,

2861
02:46:11,510 --> 02:46:14,720
is a really good wrestler and one of the
things that he does with a lot of good

2862
02:46:14,721 --> 02:46:17,600
wrestlers do they develop that,
that jump,

2863
02:46:17,601 --> 02:46:22,430
that leap forward with our power double,
you know, are Aa takedowns and when they,

2864
02:46:22,431 --> 02:46:25,280
you know, they developed that
in intense explosion forward,

2865
02:46:25,490 --> 02:46:28,760
they put that in there punch
and that's what go me does,

2866
02:46:28,761 --> 02:46:30,460
he throws punches like a fast ball.

2867
02:46:30,560 --> 02:46:35,480
I think you actually was a pitcher at
one point in time as well. Um, wow. Okay.

2868
02:46:35,600 --> 02:46:39,890
There's all, there's also people that
say he's not disproportionally short.

2869
02:46:42,190 --> 02:46:46,960
Huh? Uh, no. Yeah. It's
not particularly strong.

2870
02:46:46,961 --> 02:46:51,470
His height long arms. Who says that? Dude,

2871
02:46:51,490 --> 02:46:55,650
I just, I if you go back to his whole
thing, I will just make this up.

2872
02:46:57,070 --> 02:47:01,330
Uh, yeah. Maine has a
wingspan that is shorter.

2873
02:47:02,140 --> 02:47:06,880
Yeah. Some of them say it's not,
it's really interesting. Okay.

2874
02:47:06,920 --> 02:47:08,770
That's, it's not, it's,

2875
02:47:08,890 --> 02:47:12,490
it seems to be what people like to say.

2876
02:47:14,770 --> 02:47:18,040
I think that's a point. Yeah. It's
easier that people like to say,

2877
02:47:18,041 --> 02:47:21,550
but also people like to dispute it.
So I googled it both ways.

2878
02:47:21,551 --> 02:47:25,810
I Google not proportionally shorter.
You actually watched him play?

2879
02:47:25,811 --> 02:47:28,960
You could tell he has short arms
for his height. You could tell.

2880
02:47:29,110 --> 02:47:32,560
You could tell when he went to go
block a uh, I don't care. Okay.

2881
02:47:33,040 --> 02:47:36,550
Well I'm still fighting for my point.
Why do you want it so bad? Cause I just,

2882
02:47:36,551 --> 02:47:37,440
I just know.
Um,

2883
02:47:37,540 --> 02:47:42,540
every statement I make is going to be
Google or Wikipedia and I like to go three

2884
02:47:42,821 --> 02:47:46,510
for three. So do you think you would be
better? I mean I think it got us a tall,

2885
02:47:46,540 --> 02:47:47,270
basically just came,

2886
02:47:47,270 --> 02:47:50,220
hold the ball above everybody's head and
it gets a certain point when dudes are

2887
02:47:50,230 --> 02:47:53,050
like 10 feet tall. Yeah. But we
still gonna use the same height.

2888
02:47:53,050 --> 02:47:56,710
Basketball cause they've already
talked about moving it up a foot.

2889
02:47:56,740 --> 02:47:59,290
Five minute warning. All right,
let's wrap this pitch up. We uh,

2890
02:47:59,320 --> 02:48:03,120
yeah because at one point in time, like
no one was seven foot six, right? Yeah.

2891
02:48:03,180 --> 02:48:06,160
Who's seven foot six? Just 10 years
old was the tallest man in the world.

2892
02:48:06,161 --> 02:48:09,930
When did he, when was he alive? Like the
tall scowling worlds, like eight, six.

2893
02:48:09,970 --> 02:48:12,250
But those are the guys with
like fucked up pituitary glands.

2894
02:48:12,300 --> 02:48:15,820
They're not like a Yao Ming who's like a
functional normal dude who just happens

2895
02:48:15,821 --> 02:48:18,070
to be gigantic. But you just, I mean like,

2896
02:48:18,840 --> 02:48:19,290
okay.

2897
02:48:19,290 --> 02:48:20,880
Kevin Garnett,
when he came into Lee,

2898
02:48:20,881 --> 02:48:24,690
he was like a seven footer who's
built like a, uh, a normal,

2899
02:48:24,691 --> 02:48:28,710
like a horse if I use proportionate so
it could run no normal because before it

2900
02:48:28,711 --> 02:48:32,910
was like these guys with these very
long legs, right? Small Torsos.

2901
02:48:33,330 --> 02:48:37,710
There was the first time it was like
actual proportionate seven footers. Yeah.

2902
02:48:37,711 --> 02:48:38,250
That pretty soon,

2903
02:48:38,250 --> 02:48:41,880
that's the whole Mbas is going to be
like all seven footers at every different

2904
02:48:42,030 --> 02:48:44,730
position just with different
strengths and weaknesses.

2905
02:48:44,760 --> 02:48:47,880
And if they didn't have weight
classes in the UFC, by the way,

2906
02:48:48,090 --> 02:48:52,460
if the 265 pounds wasn't the heavyweight
limit and the superhero heavyweight

2907
02:48:52,470 --> 02:48:55,420
division, like those guys are
going to dominate those. There's,

2908
02:48:55,421 --> 02:48:58,190
there's gonna be some Chai Ganta
anti human beings in the future,

2909
02:48:58,191 --> 02:49:01,690
and they call it the monster
weight division. Well, if
there's enough fighters to,

2910
02:49:01,691 --> 02:49:05,070
to have that sort of a weight division,
they eventually will, you know.

2911
02:49:05,070 --> 02:49:08,280
Right now the reason why we
haven't implemented it is
because there's not really

2912
02:49:08,281 --> 02:49:11,400
enough super heavyweight fighters to fill
a whole division and they would be the

2913
02:49:11,401 --> 02:49:14,250
cream of the crop, the super heavy, what
would be the best, biggest, the best guy.

2914
02:49:14,370 --> 02:49:16,710
But I think one day eventually that's
going to happen, but he's in there.

2915
02:49:16,711 --> 02:49:20,670
This whole fear that people wouldn't
like try to make weight as much.

2916
02:49:20,671 --> 02:49:23,820
Like you'd see guys who probably
could fight at the heavyweight level,

2917
02:49:23,821 --> 02:49:25,530
but they would like lean back,

2918
02:49:25,590 --> 02:49:29,160
like kinda like big country
who could be very dominant,

2919
02:49:29,161 --> 02:49:32,460
two oh five but he prefers to
stay at the heavyweight thing.

2920
02:49:32,461 --> 02:49:34,560
You might see that a little bit more guys.

2921
02:49:34,561 --> 02:49:38,670
If they could make it like
a super heavyweight would
go there instead of trying

2922
02:49:38,671 --> 02:49:41,340
to make the way a heavy, we have a
dude's can do whatever they want anyway.

2923
02:49:41,370 --> 02:49:43,230
You know, you could fight it,
whatever weight class you want.

2924
02:49:43,231 --> 02:49:46,800
I mean Bj Penn is fought heavyweight
before Bj Penn fought Leo Machida

2925
02:49:46,801 --> 02:49:50,340
essentially at heavyweight. Liotta was
heavier than two oh five and they fought.

2926
02:49:50,341 --> 02:49:54,240
So it's like, you know, if you want
to get up to that weight class,

2927
02:49:54,241 --> 02:49:57,450
as long as you weigh in more than two 65,
you can find where the fuck you want.

2928
02:49:57,630 --> 02:49:57,860
Well,

2929
02:49:57,860 --> 02:50:00,550
if you're a guy like built like a guy
like big country or if you build a good

2930
02:50:00,551 --> 02:50:01,141
guy,
like you know,

2931
02:50:01,141 --> 02:50:03,810
Anderson Silva is lean and you can
do whatever the fuck you want really.

2932
02:50:04,140 --> 02:50:07,980
So it's this, I don't think there's any
like fear of people like getting too big,

2933
02:50:08,370 --> 02:50:11,780
but uh, I think it would be interesting
to see big giant dudes this weekend and

2934
02:50:12,120 --> 02:50:13,380
Montreal,
or excuse me,

2935
02:50:13,381 --> 02:50:18,381
in Toronto also is the UFC and the first
ever UFC flyweight title will change

2936
02:50:19,651 --> 02:50:23,010
hands. And Joseph Benevidez
was at our show at the,

2937
02:50:23,490 --> 02:50:27,960
in Sacramento and we want to wish him
luck and he's fighting a mighty mouse,

2938
02:50:28,200 --> 02:50:30,690
Demetrius mighty mouse Johnson.
I want to wish him luck too.

2939
02:50:30,691 --> 02:50:34,320
It's going to be a great fucking fight
and it's for the first ever first ever

2940
02:50:34,321 --> 02:50:38,410
flyweight champion ship. It's going
to be sick this weekend. All right,

2941
02:50:38,430 --> 02:50:42,330
tomorrow we have rich roll on the
podcast who is a Vegan athlete.

2942
02:50:42,510 --> 02:50:44,850
And then Mac Danzig,
we'll return on Wednesday.

2943
02:50:44,880 --> 02:50:46,680
And Mac Danzig is also a Vegan athlete.

2944
02:50:46,770 --> 02:50:50,360
So it sounded like I'm just anti
Vegan folks. I'm just anti dummy.

2945
02:50:51,240 --> 02:50:54,360
So I respect that and I'm anti beans.
Peas can go fuck themselves.

2946
02:50:54,540 --> 02:50:59,130
But I'm pro Sam Tripoli.
I Follow Sam Tripoli on Twitter folks.

your could support Sam. You know,

2948
02:51:04,051 --> 02:51:07,250
I love you and I'm just always
a privilege to be people.

2949
02:51:07,290 --> 02:51:10,200
A lot of people hear comedians talk shit
with each other and they get a little

2950
02:51:10,201 --> 02:51:14,740
nervous. And that's what we do folks. We
fucking rag each other constantly. And uh,

2951
02:51:14,790 --> 02:51:18,230
that's why we enjoy hanging
out. And when I, uh, I,

2952
02:51:18,231 --> 02:51:22,650
I'd say that Sam's a little lazy, but he
is very, very, very fucking funny though.

2953
02:51:22,680 --> 02:51:25,470
And uh,
it's an honor to wrote Gig it with you.

2954
02:51:25,471 --> 02:51:28,500
My brother and I am honored
and privileged. And by the way,

2955
02:51:28,501 --> 02:51:32,970
Brian Redman crushed it
in Sacramento. Ladies and
gentlemen, I was very impressed.

2956
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,490
That was a, that was a real
solid set dude. Brian's a real,

2957
02:51:35,491 --> 02:51:38,430
been really been dedicated
to a stand up lately.

2958
02:51:38,640 --> 02:51:40,530
And the rewards are showing.

2959
02:51:40,531 --> 02:51:43,440
And he'll also be at the ice
house this Wednesday night.

2960
02:51:43,441 --> 02:51:47,610
So this one's in as a crazy fucking show.

2962

crazy. So tomorrow which role? Wednesday,

2965
02:52:02,280 --> 02:52:06,630
That's how little of a fuck
we give you feel me, Sam.

2966
02:52:06,650 --> 02:52:10,340
Troubling dude. You're bringing the
wood. Damn, I'm bringing the wood. Uh,

They're really beautiful phones and uh,

02:52:49,631 --> 02:52:54,400
they have it set up so that you can have
several phones in one account so that

2978
02:52:54,401 --> 02:52:57,730

2979
02:52:57,731 --> 02:52:59,980
you don't have to pay for
two fucking accounts. You,
