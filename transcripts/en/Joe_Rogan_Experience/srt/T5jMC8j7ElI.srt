1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,540
Good Google [inaudible].

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,150
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
podcast is supported by Squarespace,

3
00:00:08,151 --> 00:00:12,180
the all in one platform that makes
it fast and easy to create your own

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,170
professional website.

5
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:13,260
Now,

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,400
that's what you're supposed to say.

7
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:15,234
That's their thing.

8
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:15,720
Uh,

9
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,411
when I say is,

10
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:21,411
it's the easiest way to make a
website without learning dream weaver,

11
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:25,650
did he keep me learn dream or did they
use that shit anymore without learning

12
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:26,484
html,

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,640
without actually trying to figure
out the INS and outs of coding?

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,520
What you need to do is just
go to Squarespace and make
your own website with an

15
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:37,260
easy drag and drop interface.

16
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:38,490
It's super easy to do.

17
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,241
I could do it.

18
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:40,074
You could do it.

19
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,920
If you can do the normal functions of
attaching a photograph to email and

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,330
clicking on links,

21
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,320
you can figure it out.

22
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:48,990
It's not hard and it's beautiful designs.

23
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,770
They have 24 seven support and
they've also launched a logo creator.

24
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,120
So you can create your own
clean and simple logo design
for yourself in minutes.

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,770
You can set up an online store,

26
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,180
very easy to do,

27
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,980
easy to set up an online store,

28
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:03,240
easy to sell music.

29
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:04,140
If you're a musician,

30
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:05,610
you can sell digital downloads.

31
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,790
Squarespace has a whole ecommerce section
dedicated to showing you how to figure

32
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:11,431
this all out.

33
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:13,190
They have a self help website that will,

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,460
that will better deliver the customer
experience and for a free trial and 10%

35
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:18,540
off your first purchases,

36
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,870
go to squarespace.com and
enter the code word Joe.

37
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:24,450
One of the other things that are really
like about Squarespace is you don't have

38
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,640
to use your credit card to try it out.

39
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,030
You,

40
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,080
they'll let you sign up,

41
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:28,681
try it out,

42
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:29,520
build a website,

43
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:29,971
and then he'd go,

44
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:30,121
oh,

45
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:30,960
this is pretty bad ass.

46
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,430
Then you enter your credit card,

47
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,630
so I like that,

48
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:34,380
so you could test it.

49
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,213
Try it out.

50
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,680
squarespace.com enter the code word Joe,

51
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,700
get 10% off.

52
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,470
We're also brought to you by stamps.com
which is another very easy and

53
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:47,910
convenient way to deal with things that
you used to have to go somewhere for.

54
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,110
You used to have to go to the post office
and get someone to weigh out your shit

55
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:54,060
and put different labels
on each one of them.

56
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,300
With stamps.com you can print up you
as postal from your own home computer.

57
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,860
Very easy to do.

58
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,720
You can print it.

59
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,050
You weigh it all out in a
digital scale that they provide.

60
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,730
They give you a free digital scale,

61
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:11,100
$55 worth of free postage,

62
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,640
and you put this digital scale on it.

63
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,120
It tells you exactly what the
price is and if the price changes,

64
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,220
like if the postage goes up,

65
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,061
no big deal.

66
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:23,940
stamps.com they have that programmed into
it so you don't have to worry about it

67
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:24,540
at all.

68
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,740
Handed off to the post man.

69
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:28,500
And you're done so much less time,

70
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:29,880
so much less hassle,

71
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:31,560
no lines at the post office,

72
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,590
all done right through your desk.

73
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,240
And if you go to stamps.com
and use the Promo Code J R e,

74
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,520
you'll get that no risk trial.

75
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,900
Hundred $10 bonus offer,

and up to $55 of free postage.

77
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,680
So go to stamps.com
before you do anything,

78
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:54,360
click on that old school he microphone
and the top of the homepage and type in j

79
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:57,990
r e that stamps.com j r e

80
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,670
and we're also brought to you by on it.

81
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,121
That's o.

82
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:03,810
N N.

83
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:03,810
I.

84
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:03,810
T.

85
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,150
Um,

86
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,470
if you don't know what od on it is,

87
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:06,310
if you've never heard of on it,

88
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,290
it's a human optimization website.

89
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,340
We essentially sell like the best
strength and conditioning equipment we can

90
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:15,220
find as far as like kettle
bells and battle ropes.

91
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,960
The best protein we can find.

92
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,230
We have hemp protein and we're going to
talk to Dr Karl Hartley later about hemp

93
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,230
because it's one of the funniest things
ever that helps illegal in this country

94
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,760
and it doesn't even get you high.

95
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,020
That's how stupid we are.

96
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,891
And we have a,

97
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:32,170
an awesome plant that tastes good,

98
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,970
has amino acids in it,

99
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:37,300
provides you with like a
real complete pro protein,

100
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,110
very easy to digest
and it's legal to have,

101
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:42,310
but you've got to get it from Canada.

102
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,760
We have to pay Canadian farmers to
grow it and then bring it over here.

103
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:47,260
It's one of the dumbest things ever,

104
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:52,690
and it's just one more symptom of
this goofy fucking country we live in,

105
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,524
ladies and gentlemen,

106
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,610
but it on it.

107
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,443
We sell,

108
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,410
uh,

109
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,620
things along those lines
like the hemp forest.

110
00:03:58,621 --> 00:03:59,510
We also have a,

111
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,670
the new warrior bar,

112
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:01,400
which is a,

113
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,920
uh,

114
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,140
a buffalo and cranberry bar done
the way the native Americans did it.

115
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,360
It's really kind of bad ass.

116
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,110
Um,

117
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,690
it was by the same people
that made the Tonka bar.

118
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:12,430
They've started making this new one,

119
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:13,211
the warrior bar.

120
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,350
It's really delicious.

121
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:15,430
No antibiotics,

122
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,660
no added hormones,

123
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:18,910
gluten free and no nitrates.

124
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:19,760
Um,

125
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,140
what we sell you would honor is all
the best shit that we find the best

126
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:23,801
supplements,

127
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:25,030
the best foods,

128
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,251
the,

129
00:04:25,251 --> 00:04:26,410
as far as like snack foods,

130
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:27,520
like hemp force bars,

131
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:29,110
the best strength and
conditioning equipment.

132
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,950
We just try to sell you all the things
that we use and all of the things that

133
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,400
you can use to optimize
your physical condition,

134
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,600
your mental clarity,

135
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,800
and get your shit together.

136
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,390
Go to onnit.com o.

137
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:40,691
N,

138
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:45,280
N I t used the Codeword Rogan and
save 10% off any and all supplements.

139
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,240
All right.

140
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,350
Dr. Carl Hart is here.

141
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,760
Choose the music and let's get cracking

142
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,700
the Joe Rogan experience.

143
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,930
Joe Rogan podcast,

144
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:57,100
my name.

145
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,613
Hey Man,

146
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,890
thank you very much for being here.

147
00:05:01,891 --> 00:05:02,491
I really,

148
00:05:02,491 --> 00:05:03,324
really appreciate this.

149
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,640
Admired your work online of seeing a
bunch of your videos and read some of the

150
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,730
interviews and uh,

151
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,120
I think it's,

152
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:12,170
it's incredibly important to
have a guy like you out there.

153
00:05:12,171 --> 00:05:13,004
It's incredibly,

154
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,990
it's incredibly important
for a bunch of reasons.

155
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:15,650
One,

156
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,580
because it's important to spread the truth
about drugs and to have someone who's

157
00:05:19,581 --> 00:05:22,820
actually intelligent and a real professor
who really understands what they're

158
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:25,790
talking about and to you look like us,

159
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,360
man.

160
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,040
I get normal.

161
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,380
You don't look like
some weird stuffy dude.

162
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:31,360
You got dreadlocks.

163
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,360
You look cool as fuck.

164
00:05:32,361 --> 00:05:34,370
Like I could hang with
this guy guaranteed.

165
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,700
Any dude who has dry.

166
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,620
You can't be uptight.

167
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,191
Look at your hair.

168
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:38,150
It's impossible.

169
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,043
You know?

170
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:39,920
I think it's important.

171
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,611
It's very important.

172
00:05:40,611 --> 00:05:41,500
I appreciate that.

173
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,530
Thank you for having me,

174
00:05:42,531 --> 00:05:42,920
man.

175
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,050
The people have been telling me
that I've got to come check you out.

176
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:45,884
So thank you.

177
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,341
Well,

178
00:05:46,341 --> 00:05:47,450
I'm glad that connected us.

179
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:47,991
You know,

180
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:51,590
that's one of the coolest things about
this whole Twitter social media thing is

181
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:51,830
that,

182
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,220
you know,

183
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,550
I get to find out about people like
you and I get to be introduced by,

184
00:05:55,551 --> 00:05:55,910
uh,

185
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,830
all these Twitter people
want to get us together.

186
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,800
So it's pretty bad at it.

187
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:58,950
Right.

188
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,601
All right,

189
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:00,434
I'm happy to be here,

190
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:00,870
man.

191
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,840
[inaudible] again,

192
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:04,880
I say I'm happy that there's a guy like
you out there because I've learned a lot

193
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:08,330
from what you're doing and I've learned
a lot from some of the interviews that

194
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:09,170
you've had where,

195
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:09,760
you know,

196
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,710
you've had to kind of confront a lot
of the ignorance that people have.

197
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,520
And it even kind of exposed a
lot of my own ignorance and a,

198
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,810
I thought that was really fascinating.

199
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,560
And one of the things was you did a
John Stossel interview where you were

200
00:06:20,561 --> 00:06:25,130
talking about how many people use meth
and coke and don't fucking ruin their

201
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:25,610
lives.

202
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:25,961
They,

203
00:06:25,961 --> 00:06:27,470
they figured out how to keep it together.

204
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:27,920
Like,

205
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,251
yeah.

206
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:28,521
You know,

207
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,590
that's one of the biggest myths
is that people think that,

208
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,010
uh,

209
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,470
individuals who use
drugs like crack cocaine,

210
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,281
methamphetamine,

211
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:35,114
heroin,

212
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,300
they think that the majority of the
people who use those drugs are addicted in

213
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:38,721
their life,

214
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:40,640
goes spiraling out of control.

215
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,300
They think that because
it makes great TV drama,

216
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:45,200
for example.

217
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,170
And so we reinforce it in
our sort of pop culture.

218
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,240
And also we can always think of somebody
who screwed to life up as a result of

219
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:54,074
drugs.

220
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,000
But the people who don't
screw their life up,

221
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,050
they don't talk about it.

222
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:59,030
They just go about paying taxes,

223
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:00,080
paying their bills,

224
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,940
handling their responsibilities.

225
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:02,631
Yeah.

226
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:03,441
That's interesting.

227
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:06,380
Do you get pressured to not say that ever?

228
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:07,430
Because people say,

229
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:07,551
well,

230
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:07,731
hey,

231
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:09,110
you're going to encourage people.

232
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,990
And what if they go out and they
do become addicted to drugs?

233
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:13,640
Like what are you giving them false hope?

234
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,211
Well,

235
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:14,720
you know,

236
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,141
that's,

237
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:15,470
uh,

238
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,760
I'm an educator first.

239
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,900
And so when we think about
hiding information or not
telling people the truth

240
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:23,600
because we were afraid that
they can't handle the truth,

241
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,540
it's just illogical and I
can't live my life like that.

242
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,590
I have children then I have
to thank you for saying that.

243
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:29,731
Yeah,

244
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:30,564
no I don't.

245
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,600
I mean I have to teach my kids about sex.

246
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:35,950
I have to teach them about
other potentially dangerous
activities like driving

247
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:37,400
their automobile too fast.

248
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,630
Drugs is just one of those sort of
activities and I'd be irresponsible if I

249
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:45,710
didn't tell them the best information
that I know that's so important.

250
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,370
That's such an important thing to say
and I've had that discussion with people

251
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:50,470
before where you know,

252
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,040
there would talk about any,

253
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:52,791
any sort of drug,

254
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,030
but I don't want to let people
know I don't want to talk about it.

255
00:07:56,031 --> 00:07:57,830
And I went because then I'll
encourage them to do it.

256
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,110
Like a friend was telling
me that about heroin.

257
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:00,771
He was saying,

258
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,190
you know,

259
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,070
heroin really is not that bad for
you if you don't take too much.

260
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,330
It's really not that bad.

261
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,470
That sounds like sex.

262
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:07,304
I mean,

263
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,080
it sounds like a number of things.

264
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:09,411
You know,

265
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:10,880
it's like we all know this.

266
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:12,110
I mean it's just logical.

267
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,140
Anything that you overindulge
and you can get in trouble.

268
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,640
Heroin is not different,

269
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,320
but there's a few that we have like
these unfair assumptions about like crack

270
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:22,130
was the one from me.

271
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:22,701
I always heard,

272
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:22,971
dude,

273
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:24,290
you smoke crack once you're hooked.

274
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,260
Then I met a few people that
have smoked crack and I'm like,

275
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:27,500
wait man,

276
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,550
you just smoked it once.

277
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,231
You know?

278
00:08:29,231 --> 00:08:30,064
Like yeah,

279
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,960
so if anybody ever tells
you anything about,

280
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:35,270
I did it once and I was
hooked for life or a hook.

281
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,310
That's a license to stop listening because
nothing in life you do once and your

282
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:40,670
hook.

283
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,690
That's just nothing.

284
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:42,320
Nothing.

285
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,790
What's the quickest to addict too?

286
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:44,311
Like is there,

287
00:08:44,311 --> 00:08:44,491
there,

288
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,830
there are certainly physical addictions.

289
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,590
Like people do get
alcoholism where they are.

290
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,600
It actually makes them sick if
they stop like physical addiction.

291
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:52,340
Certainly that's a part of addiction,

292
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:55,530
but that's not the sort of main
point of addiction addiction.

293
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:59,370
The main thing of addiction is like dis
disruption of psychosocial functioning.

294
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:00,360
You don't pay your taxes,

295
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:01,530
you don't meet your obligations,

296
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:02,430
those kinds of things.

297
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,720
But you can get physically addicted to
something like tobacco or those night

298
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:07,590
life threatening.

299
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,450
But it's irritating.

300
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:11,660
But the thing that we see that's more,

301
00:09:11,661 --> 00:09:12,120
um,

302
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,370
that we think is excruciating pain.

303
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,840
His heroin addiction,

304
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,531
for example,

305
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:19,290
we think that someone is going
through heroin withdrawal.

306
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,130
They are in such agonizing pain
that day are on the verge of debt.

307
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,180
They're not,

308
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,650
if you've ever had the flu,

309
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,110
you've had heroin withdrawal and,

310
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:31,830
but the only one of the major
drugs that we use today,

311
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,560
it's that connects really
killed us from withdrawal.

312
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,423
It's alcohol.

313
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,140
And most of the people who use alcohol
don't come near experience in alcohol

314
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:40,550
withdrawal.

315
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,880
To the extent that it would kill you.

316
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,430
You certainly can't die
from heroin withdrawal.

317
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,631
Wow,

318
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:46,650
that's fascinating.

319
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,160
Um,

320
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,410
I've seen a guy going
through heroin withdrawal.

321
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:52,800
I had a friend who was hooked on heroin
and came out from New York to stay with

322
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,800
me in California in the 90s and
I didn't know it at the time,

323
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,200
but his idea was that was
how I was going to kick it.

324
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,240
So it came out to visit
me and he was like,

325
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:00,631
look,

326
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:01,620
he had the flu for a week.

327
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,470
It just laid around in bed and then seven,

328
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:05,580
eight days later it was fine.

329
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,151
Yeah,

330
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:06,961
it's not fine,

331
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:08,850
but it's the flu basically,

332
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:09,091
you know?

333
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:10,170
So if you've had the flu,

334
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:11,430
you've had heroin withdrawal.

335
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,570
It's not pleasant.

336
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:16,140
And I don't recommend that someone go
out and get the flu or heroin withdraw.

337
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,600
But the point is is that
isn't that going to kill you?

338
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:22,860
And it's not as excruciating
as is often portrayed in films.

339
00:10:22,861 --> 00:10:24,450
And so those kinds of things,

340
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:27,600
they just do a horrible job of
educating the public or miss,

341
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:28,590
educating the public.

342
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,600
And it wouldn't be bad if,

343
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,220
let's just say you do this
sort of characteristic
characterization and it didn't

344
00:10:35,221 --> 00:10:36,210
have consequences.

345
00:10:36,211 --> 00:10:41,211
The consequences is that we always have
these repressive policies that follow

346
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,160
and then people pay the price.

347
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,420
Not so much from the drugs,

348
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:46,950
but from the repressive policies.

349
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:48,990
And that's a real concern that I have.

350
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,000
So the repressive policies lead to more
prison sentences lead to more private

351
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:56,520
prisons lead to essentially
people becoming,

352
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,670
it's like a form of slavery
that's state sanctioned.

353
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:00,990
Certainly we have that.

354
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:05,640
And it also the major thing that it
leads to this sort of dependency on that

355
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:06,330
economy,

356
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,470
like law enforcement,

357
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,150
they are also treatment agencies.

358
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:13,920
There are a number of people who depend
on this sort of industry now or they

359
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,730
depend on this approach and it's hard to
get out of there just approach because

360
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,390
right now in the country we're
talking about liberalizing drug laws.

361
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,020
You can't liberalize drug laws unless you
give police officers something else to

362
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:25,261
do.

363
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:29,160
You can't liberalize drug laws unless
you give the treatment industry something

364
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:29,994
else to do.

365
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,390
And that's one of the things we haven't
really talked about in this whole

366
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:38,190
conversation because those people are
going to fight to keep their money and

367
00:11:38,191 --> 00:11:39,240
they sort of are now,

368
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,500
I mean that is an issue now.

369
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:44,520
Prison guard unions lobby to
keep certain drug laws in place.

370
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,360
Absolutely.

371
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,811
They are.

372
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:46,351
They are.

373
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:46,610
Uh,

374
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,580
they are intense.

375
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,510
So it seems to me like it needs to be,

376
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,070
there's a multipoint strategy

377
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,750
that has to be hit in order to make a
transition between the prohibition that

378
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,860
we're experiencing right now.

379
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,030
And you know,

380
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:04,510
not having all these people completely
fighting against it because of their

381
00:12:04,511 --> 00:12:05,344
jobs.

382
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,370
Like there has to be some sort of a
strategy for taking the resources that are

383
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:13,120
being applied right now to this
unsuccessful drug war and doing something

384
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:14,140
healthy for communities.

385
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:14,620
Yeah.

386
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,011
You know,

387
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:15,761
that's one of the things,

388
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:17,200
I wrote my book recently,

389
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:19,180
high price and that's one
of the things I tried to,

390
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,050
uh,

391
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,100
well I told the story,

392
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:23,020
it's a memoir and a science book.

393
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:25,150
So I told them memoir portion,

394
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,990
which is deeply personal and it's not
something that I'm so comfortable doing,

395
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:33,310
but I have to do that in order to kind
of contextualize the whole drug war and

396
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:34,300
what it all means,

397
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,141
what it all means.

398
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:35,974
And also,

399
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,490
um,

400
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,660
the science portion,

401
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,151
uh,

402
00:12:38,151 --> 00:12:40,370
is there so people can
understand what these days,

403
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,250
these drugs actually do
and what they don't do.

404
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:45,940
And if you have that sort
of contextualization and
an understanding of the

405
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:46,930
science now,

406
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:49,990
you can probably make some
reasonable logical decisions,

407
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:53,350
some choices about how we should
deal with drugs in the country.

408
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,630
Now when you see something like,

409
00:12:55,631 --> 00:12:56,770
or the country of Portugal,

410
00:12:56,771 --> 00:12:59,050
which decriminalized drugs
less than a decade ago,

411
00:12:59,051 --> 00:12:59,530
right?

412
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,570
More than a decade ago,

413
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,930
almost one than our 2001.

414
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,030
And their results have
been pretty extraordinary.

415
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:04,391
Yeah.

416
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:04,691
You know,

417
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:06,100
when you like Portugal,

418
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,360
let's just be clear.

419
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:10,180
So the audience understands
what decriminalization means.

420
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,460
Decriminalization is not legalization.

421
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:15,400
Legalization is what we do
with alcohol and tobacco.

422
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,490
Decriminalization would be
like treating drug violations.

423
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:19,450
Like we treat,

424
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,010
um,

425
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,170
uh,

426
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,220
traffic violations.

427
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:22,180
You can't go to jail.

428
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:23,470
They'll get a felony charge,

429
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,880
but you may be subjected to a fine or
so that's how they deal with drugs and

430
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:28,390
Portugal,

431
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,540
all drugs from heroin to
marijuana to methamphetamine,

432
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,403
cocaine.

433
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,690
Now when you look at the major indicators,

434
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,441
for example,

435
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:36,274
drug use,

436
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:36,670
um,

437
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,550
they have less drug use
than we do in this country.

438
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,920
When you look at drug
related overdose deaths,

439
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,870
they have less than we do in this country.

440
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:44,831
When you have,

441
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,220
um,

442
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,580
the amount of money that they pump
into their prison systems and so forth.

443
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,290
Of course they're pumping less than we do.

444
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:54,460
And so they're doing better than us on
all of these major indicators and they

445
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:59,461
have no sort of plans to go
another directions because
they're happy with their

446
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,370
current approach.

447
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,490
And so that's one of the things
I argue for in high price.

448
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,360
The book,

449
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,720
I argued that we should decriminalize
all drugs in this country,

450
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,940
but in order to decriminalize drugs,

451
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:13,630
one of the things we have to also do
is we have to increase the amount of

452
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:15,190
realistic drug education.

453
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:20,200
Not that just say no stuff that we've
been peddling for a number of years,

454
00:14:20,201 --> 00:14:21,670
but real drug education,

455
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,940
it's pretty ridiculous to think that
you can educate anyone to the dangers or

456
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:30,340
lack of dangers in drugs
in a 32nd commercial.

457
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:31,090
Right?

458
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:31,590
Yeah.

459
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,351
You know,

460
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:33,430
but that's not the goal.

461
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:33,821
That's the,

462
00:14:33,821 --> 00:14:36,850
that's one of the things that people have
to understand is that those folks who

463
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:40,960
came up with those 32nd spots that
go was not drug education there,

464
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:44,200
drove their go was more prob propaganda.

465
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,630
And a fear based sort of,

466
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,380
um,

467
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:47,680
uh,

468
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,600
education if so,

469
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:49,780
if that's what we want to call it.

470
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:52,130
But that the goal was not really teaching

471
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,170
people about drugs and
what drugs really do.

472
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,980
I had a joke in one of my old comedy
specials about the Partnership for drug

473
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:02,150
free America because it was funded by
alcohol and tobacco companies and I just

474
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,910
like alcohol and tobacco
companies going after marijuana.

475
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:06,470
It's like hookers going after strippers.

476
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,690
I mean that's really what it's like
with the idea of alcohol and tobacco

477
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:15,860
companies spending money to try to make
marijuana illegal is it's unbelievably

478
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:16,820
stupid that tell you,

479
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:17,090
Bro,

480
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,400
if you studied this issue,

481
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,690
you will have a hell of a lot more
material for your comedy routine,

482
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:27,560
not tell you it's because there are so
many ironies that you wouldn't believe.

483
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,170
That's a brutal one though part.

484
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:33,410
And then the call was held partnership
for a drug free America sponsored by

485
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,693
drugs.

486
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,430
Yeah,

487
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,710
but gang war of drugs.

488
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,310
The name of the Partnership
for drug free America.

489
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,143
First of all,

490
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,820
there has never been a
drug free society ever,

491
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,360
ever.

492
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,070
Nor will there ever be.

493
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,580
And nor do you want to live in
a society that is drug free.

494
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,400
And so this whole notion of drug free,

495
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,260
it's ridiculous.

496
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,341
Yeah.

497
00:15:55,341 --> 00:16:00,341
Drugs encompass everything from
coffee to alcohol to cigarettes.

498
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,340
It just goes on to Asai Berries.

499
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,051
No,

500
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:06,651
absolutely.

501
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:07,041
You know,

502
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:07,281
it's,

503
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:07,580
it's,

504
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,070
all of these things are drugs.

505
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:14,540
And so when people tried to make the
distinction like heroin versus something

506
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:16,460
like caffeine,

507
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,990
the body doesn't distinguish something
based on the fact that it's eleague ones

508
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,940
illegal in once,

509
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:22,783
not legal.

510
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,730
It has biological
actions and consequences,

511
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,750
both of those things.

512
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,890
Why is it that this is something
that's controversial to say?

513
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:31,260
Like what,

514
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,170
what you're saying right now on,

515
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,490
on this podcast,

516
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,090
you know,

517
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,370
a guy who's a distinguished
academic saying these things,

518
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,560
it's very controversial.

519
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:40,370
Why is that?

520
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,330
If they are true and you are an
educator and you have that philosophy,

521
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:45,500
which I admire greatly,

522
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,700
why is that rare?

523
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,133
Uh,

524
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:48,950
you know,

525
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:49,850
for one thing,

526
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,880
there are a few people in the country who
actually know what drugs really do and

527
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:56,000
what they don't do.

528
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,290
So when you think about,

529
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:57,951
you know,

530
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:00,200
I have 24 years of experience,

531
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:04,490
have given drugs to animals and humans
in the lab and carefully trying to

532
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,080
understanding the effect of drugs.

533
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,540
That's one reason.

534
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,680
I mean a number of people
just simply don't know.

535
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,630
Another reason is that,

536
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,440
uh,

537
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:12,981
people,

538
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:14,300
scientists for example,

539
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,560
our conservative lot,

540
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,790
and they are reluctant to speak to the
media in part because they don't want to

541
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,560
get their words twisted or they won't,

542
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,570
don't want to be appear to be wrong.

543
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,840
And so I,

544
00:17:24,841 --> 00:17:25,191
I mean,

545
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:26,630
I respect that at some level.

546
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,440
Uh,

547
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,210
and so I think that that contributes on
the one hand in and the other hand we've

548
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:34,820
had in this country for a number of years,

549
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,320
people who were in control
of the narrative where
people who had an addiction,

550
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,813
parents,

551
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,810
law enforcement,

552
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:47,470
none of those people are uniquely
qualified to speak to this issue,

553
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,800
but they have dominated conversation.

554
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,160
Now how did you get involved in this?

555
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:54,000
You started,

556
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,210
you said 24 years ago doing
drug research on animals.

557
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:57,780
How did,

558
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,051
what,

559
00:17:58,051 --> 00:17:58,561
what was,

560
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:00,300
what led you to want to go down this road?

561
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,650
So I was in,

562
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,600
I tell this story in the book.

563
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:05,130
And so I was in the air force,

564
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:05,400
uh,

565
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,181
back in the 80s,

566
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:07,020
like you mentioned,

567
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:08,010
about crack cocaine.

568
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:09,900
So I was in the air force over in England,

569
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:10,680
um,

570
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,760
86,

571
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,481
87,

572
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:13,130
88.

573
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:13,950
Um,

574
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,550
and crack cocaine was a big deal in
the United States as you point out.

575
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:22,551
And I grew up in the hood and Miami
and Miami was a cocaine capital in the

576
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:23,821
United States.

577
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:24,340
And,

578
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,620
and so things that were happening
in my community that were not good,

579
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,400
uh,

580
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,590
high unemployment crime,

581
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:32,850
all of these kinds of things,

582
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,650
I blame crack cocaine for that.

583
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:40,040
And so I thought that if I go to school
and get a degree in order to study

584
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:40,621
drugs,

585
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,330
the effects of drugs on the brain,

586
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:47,160
I could solve the problems that face my
community or the problems that I thought

587
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:48,420
were in the community,

588
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,520
particularly those related to drugs.

589
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,690
And so I began studying drugs as an
undergraduate and then went on to graduate

590
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:55,400
school,

591
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:55,830
uh,

592
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:00,060
to study drugs on the brains of
animals and to try to figure out the

593
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:03,090
neurobiological mechanisms that
were responsible for addiction.

594
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,800
So you just got fascinated
by this idea of fixing this,

595
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:11,310
this issue that you saw in your community
and then you just fell into a rabbit

596
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:11,950
hole.

597
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:12,390
Yeah.

598
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,300
So when I started along my journey,

599
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:15,901
my path,

600
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:18,150
I actually got an education and you know,

601
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:18,570
so,

602
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,290
uh,

603
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,700
as James Baldwin said,

604
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:20,860
a,

605
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,301
you know,

606
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:21,530
the,

607
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:21,791
the,

608
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:22,310
the,

609
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,760
the paradox that education,

610
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:27,450
that's precisely it is as one begins
to become educated and conscious,

611
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,440
one begins to question the society
in which he's being educated.

612
00:19:31,441 --> 00:19:32,700
And that's what happened with me.

613
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,500
And so along the way I discovered things
like the majority of people who use

614
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:38,930
these drugs are not addicted.

615
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,200
That was one thing I discovered.

616
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:43,470
I discovered that many of the things
that we set about crack about crack

617
00:19:43,471 --> 00:19:43,921
cocaine,

618
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:45,330
we're just simply not true.

619
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,520
Like the cold crack baby myths.

620
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:52,410
And people said that when w that out
generation beep should be prepared to have

621
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:52,840
a,

622
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,480
an army of kids who couldn't learn
because of being exposed to crack cocaine,

623
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,400
that just simply wasn't true.

624
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:03,300
When all the data came out
beginning in the mid 1990s,

625
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:05,310
we realized that that simply wasn't true.

626
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,210
Uh,

627
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,090
other things that I learned
that just simply wasn't true.

628
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,700
Uh,

629
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,320
uh,

630
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,011
things like,

631
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:11,340
uh,

632
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,660
one hit of crack cocaine,

633
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,500
you're addicted.

634
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,220
Not True.

635
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,590
That crack cocaine was
different from powder cocaine.

636
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,453
Not True.

637
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,160
All of these things I
discovered along the way,

638
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:20,910
but they weren't,

639
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,810
they weren't true.

640
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,250
And not only that,

641
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,950
I discovered that this wasn't new.

642
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:30,951
I went back to the early 19 hundreds
and saw the same sorta hysteria,

643
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,810
mainly race-based hysteria
surrounding drugs occurred even then.

644
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,520
And so I thought,

645
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:38,770
what's,

646
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,750
what's going on?

647
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,260
And then that helped me to be
more critical about my issue.

648
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,690
Is there a difference in the,

649
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:47,320
the effect of crack cocaine,

650
00:20:47,321 --> 00:20:48,340
the physical effect

651
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:48,671
and,

652
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:49,030
and,

653
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,710
and cocaine and heroin?

654
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:51,511
So let's,

655
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:52,460
let's think about crack cocaine,

656
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:53,763
heroin rather Robert

657
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,833
powder powder.

658
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:55,160
Yeah.

659
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,900
Let's think about crack
cocaine and powder cocaine.

660
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,490
Let's just think about
the chemical structure.

661
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:02,300
The only difference between crack cocaine
and powder cocaine is that the powder

662
00:21:02,301 --> 00:21:05,810
cocaine has this thing called the
hydrochloride salt attached to it.

663
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,510
That salt prevents it from being smoked.

664
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,270
Now you can dissolve
the powder cocaine and,

665
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,370
and water and then shoot into your arm.

666
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,920
And so you have the effects of cocaine,

667
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:16,863
uh,

668
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,740
onset of the effects within seconds.

669
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,440
The same is true with wood,

670
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,500
with crack cocaine.

671
00:21:21,501 --> 00:21:24,860
The effects or onset of a sex
effects are within seconds.

672
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,480
Now the biological activity
of cocaine is at the base,

673
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,490
not that.

674
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,540
So that hydrochloride portion on the,

675
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:32,631
uh,

676
00:21:32,631 --> 00:21:34,370
on the cocaine powder,

677
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:37,100
on powder cocaine has
no biological activity.

678
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,370
Whereas,

679
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,600
so that means that crack and
powder are the same drug.

680
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,850
They are exactly the same drug,

681
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,780
the same effect,

682
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,673
same drug.

683
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:45,951
Wow.

684
00:21:45,951 --> 00:21:47,960
So it's indistinguishable to the user.

685
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,040
Indistinguishable.

686
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,550
Now why is it that they
prepare it that way?

687
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:53,260
Like what's the benefit of preparing it?

688
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:54,370
It's just delivery.

689
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,563
Great question.

690
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,850
So one of the things that you,

691
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,420
you might recall Richard Pryor
back in the days when he got,

692
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,880
he burnt and he burned himself.

693
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:03,910
What's would smoking.

694
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,950
So he was freebasing and so he was
removing that hydrochloric portion of the

695
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:09,870
salt off of,

696
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,460
off of the cocaine base so
he could actually smoke it.

697
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,950
Now he was using ether,

698
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,100
which is highly flammable
with crack cocaine,

699
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:18,580
you don't,

700
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:18,971
now,

701
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:20,520
you no longer need the ether.

702
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:25,450
You just mix it up with baking soda and
water and the cocaine and you mix it up

703
00:22:25,451 --> 00:22:26,860
and you get rid of that salt.

704
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:30,190
So eat there is no longer need
it and it's not as dangerous.

705
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:34,300
So that's one of the reasons that we
have crack cocaine as a result of that.

706
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:35,890
And it also,

707
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,440
it made it so you could sell them in,

708
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:41,440
in unit doses to make the
drug appear to be cheaper.

709
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:44,480
Because you also might
recall in early 1980s,

710
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,430
1970s,

711
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,330
you had to buy cocaine powder in
bulk and that made it more expensive.

712
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,390
Crack cocaine made it a lot more simple,

713
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,440
simple for people to buy it
who didn't have the kind of,

714
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:56,860
uh,

715
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,430
uh,

716
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,870
expendable income that,

717
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,200
uh,

718
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,630
what's required before the mid 1980.

719
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,420
So essentially they just brought
it down to bite size portions.

720
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,283
That's right.

721
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:05,890
Exactly.

722
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,740
Rather than selling this
whole six pack or 12 pack,

723
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,900
now you can sell one item.

724
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:12,220
One can have one bottle.

725
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,260
I want to talk more about this,

726
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:14,340
but I should just clarify.

727
00:23:14,341 --> 00:23:18,090
The Richard Pryor changed his story as
he got older and actually said that he

728
00:23:18,091 --> 00:23:18,924
tried to kill himself.

729
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,190
He lit himself on fire.

730
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:21,024
Apparently.

731
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,630
Um,

732
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:25,110
I'm a huge Richard Pryor fan and I know
that that was originally what he had

733
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:25,321
said,

734
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:28,620
that he got burnt doing freebase but
I think he changed the story later.

735
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:29,760
Um,

736
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,440
I actually worked with them a bunch of
times right before he died was a real

737
00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:34,890
honor.

738
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,800
He's a real special dude as
far as a standup comedians go.

739
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,131
Yeah.

740
00:23:38,131 --> 00:23:38,964
Which you,

741
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,600
but that,

742
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,560
that um,

743
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,310
uh,

744
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,450
style of,

745
00:23:42,451 --> 00:23:42,780
uh,

746
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,970
like free base was a thing that we'd
associated with people that were really,

747
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:48,020
really fucked up.

748
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,410
Yeah.

749
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,730
Like the guys doing coke.

750
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,031
Oh,

751
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:50,391
well,

752
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:50,631
you know,

753
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:51,830
he's probably gonna mess up his life.

754
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,940
He's freebasing.

755
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,050
Oh Shit.

756
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:54,951
He's gone,

757
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:55,221
man.

758
00:23:55,221 --> 00:23:56,750
He's based and he's a bass head.

759
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,200
Yup.

760
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,501
Right.

761
00:23:57,501 --> 00:23:59,870
Base head was the thing
before crack heads.

762
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,590
Absolutely.

763
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:04,950
I described a couple of people in the
book from my neighborhood who got into

764
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,030
freebase thing and exactly the
same way you just talked about,

765
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:08,630
right?

766
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,463
Absolutely.

767
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,040
Um,

768
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:15,040
now everybody has this idea in their
head that crime and that everything

769
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:19,670
escalated in the world changed
when crack was introduced.

770
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,690
Is that a meth as well?

771
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,471
Yeah,

772
00:24:21,471 --> 00:24:22,190
it's a myth that,

773
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,023
well,

774
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,620
let me clarify it because

775
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:25,841
on the one hand,

776
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:27,250
so when crack hit the market,

777
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,730
it was first sort of,

778
00:24:28,731 --> 00:24:29,470
uh,

779
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,530
talked about December of
1984 and the La Times,

780
00:24:32,531 --> 00:24:34,060
the first time we heard a crack,

781
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,360
but it didn't become a more widely known
or available until maybe the mid 19.

782
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:44,710
My hit 1985 now once crack
cocaine hit the markets,

783
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:48,760
what happened was that people were
fighting over various new markets and

784
00:24:48,761 --> 00:24:50,620
whenever there are new illicit markets,

785
00:24:50,621 --> 00:24:50,801
yeah,

786
00:24:50,801 --> 00:24:54,760
you're going to get some violent
activity until the market settles down.

787
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:58,060
That happens with any illicit market
and that's certainly happened with crack

788
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:58,894
cocaine.

789
00:24:59,170 --> 00:24:59,590
Now,

790
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,120
one of the things that people,

791
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,660
there are a number of things that people
attribute to try to crack in terms of

792
00:25:04,661 --> 00:25:05,051
crime.

793
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:08,320
And all of the sort of downfall
of certain communities,

794
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,910
unemployment.

795
00:25:09,911 --> 00:25:14,050
They said that unemployment really
rose as a result of crack cocaine being

796
00:25:14,051 --> 00:25:19,051
around now 1982 the unemployment rate
in this country was about 11% for white

797
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:23,140
folks and it was double
that for black people.

798
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,880
That was before crack,

799
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,080
at least two,

800
00:25:26,081 --> 00:25:28,150
three years before crack
even hit the market.

801
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,490
Now doing the whole crack era,

802
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:34,960
unemployment has never been as
high as 1982 that's number one.

803
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,940
People said things like,

804
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,510
uh,

805
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,920
people from my community,

806
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,670
crack cocaine was responsible
for these mothers.

807
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:47,380
These grandmothers now
raising new generations of
kids because their daughters

808
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:50,740
were strung out on crack and so now
they have to take care of these kids.

809
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,780
That simply wasn't true.

810
00:25:52,781 --> 00:25:54,730
It's certainly happened
in in my community,

811
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:58,000
but it happened before crack
cocaine was ever on the market.

812
00:25:58,001 --> 00:26:01,420
It's certainly happened in my family
long before crack cocaine ever hit the

813
00:26:01,421 --> 00:26:02,254
market.

814
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,000
When we look at other communities,

815
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:05,670
like particularly immigrant community,

816
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,810
if you look at the Jewish community,

817
00:26:07,811 --> 00:26:10,480
when they came over to
the eastern European Jews,

818
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:11,770
when they came over in the country,

819
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,250
the early 1,918 hundreds and so forth,

820
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:15,941
uh,

821
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:19,960
what you see is that you had a similar
sort of phenomenon going on in those kind

822
00:26:19,961 --> 00:26:20,511
of community.

823
00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:20,841
And he said,

824
00:26:20,841 --> 00:26:21,431
what's his name?

825
00:26:21,431 --> 00:26:21,761
Urban,

826
00:26:21,761 --> 00:26:22,594
how,

827
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,290
uh,

828
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,470
his great book land about fathers,

829
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,770
a home of our fathers.

830
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,820
He kind of described all of
these pathological behaviors
that happened in that

831
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:31,654
community.

832
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,800
Many of those same behaviors
were attributed to crack
cocaine and black people

833
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:36,634
later,

834
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,640
but it's not it,

835
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,090
they were there long before
crack cocaine was dare,

836
00:26:40,091 --> 00:26:42,580
but crack cocaine became the scapegoat.

837
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,330
That's a fascinating scapegoat
because I bought into it hook,

838
00:26:46,331 --> 00:26:46,991
line and sinker.

839
00:26:46,991 --> 00:26:51,370
I really thought that there
was a difference between
the 1980s in the 1990s as

840
00:26:51,371 --> 00:26:52,840
far as like when crack was introduced,

841
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,321
boom,

842
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:54,010
it took off.

843
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:58,090
It was sort of something that was just
always discussed as like common facts.

844
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:58,741
Yeah,

845
00:26:58,741 --> 00:26:58,960
no,

846
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,890
I bought into it too.

847
00:26:59,891 --> 00:27:01,400
And that's what drove me to,

848
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,820
to pursue my education in a way I did.

849
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,250
But as a result of
pursuing that education,

850
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:09,220
I discovered that it was not true.

851
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,070
So

852
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:15,070
are these cultural myths the result of
a politician like political campaigns,

853
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,110
we're trying to clean up the streets and
they attributed to certain issues or is

854
00:27:19,111 --> 00:27:19,580
it,

855
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,410
is it something more widespread?

856
00:27:21,411 --> 00:27:25,100
Is it the media just we're running
with a narrative of what is it,

857
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:25,740
how'd it get started?

858
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:25,951
Well,

859
00:27:25,951 --> 00:27:29,190
there were multiple sort of of
factors and players involved.

860
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:30,630
So when we think about the politicians,

861
00:27:30,631 --> 00:27:31,464
for example,

862
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:32,670
politicians,

863
00:27:32,671 --> 00:27:34,530
if crack cocaine is the problem,

864
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:39,420
nevermind the fact that unemployment
rates was out of control before crack

865
00:27:39,421 --> 00:27:40,320
cocaine hit the mark,

866
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,453
hit the market,

867
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,350
unemployment was out of control.

868
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,340
A number of things were already uh,

869
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,250
problematic.

870
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,530
Now you have crack cocaine.

871
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,240
If you blame crack cocaine,

872
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,820
it's really easy to simply say,

873
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,590
we'll put more law enforcement,

874
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:56,491
we'll hire more.

875
00:27:56,491 --> 00:27:57,120
Cops,

876
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,670
will put more efforts in
controlling this drugs.

877
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,230
A lot easier to say,

878
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:05,250
we'll lock people up for selling
these drugs for using these drugs.

879
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,840
In the process of what you do is you
create jobs for a select group of people

880
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,720
and then you don't have to
deal with the real issues,

881
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,730
the real issues of unemployment,

882
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,170
of deprivation.

883
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:17,760
All of these things you
don't have to deal with.

884
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,320
They're far more complicated.

885
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,720
And so politicians are happy to buy in.

886
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:22,441
Now,

887
00:28:22,441 --> 00:28:26,520
one of the things about crack cocaine
is that when we think about the law that

888
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:30,420
punishes or punish crack cocaine a
hundred times more harshly than powder

889
00:28:30,421 --> 00:28:31,254
cocaine,

890
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,890
and the vast majority of people who got
punished under these laws were black.

891
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,341
80,

892
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:36,630
85% of the people,

893
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:39,120
even though they don't make
up the majority of the users.

894
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,980
So people will say things like,

895
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:41,221
well,

896
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:42,630
were those laws racist?

897
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,560
And the laws themselves weren't racist
because the black congressional black

898
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:47,394
caucus,

899
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,810
17 of the 21 members voted to,

900
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,090
uh,

901
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,170
for these laws,

902
00:28:52,171 --> 00:28:55,770
for these laws that punish crack
cocaine a hundred times more harshly.

903
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,820
But the point is,

904
00:28:56,821 --> 00:28:58,950
is that everyone bought into it,

905
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,250
parents bought into it because the
parents did it for the parents.

906
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:06,450
What this meant is that you don't actually
have to educate your kids about this.

907
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,970
You just say that they're
bad and stay away from it.

908
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,470
No education required.

909
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,400
Um,

910
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,770
even scientists and treatment providers,

911
00:29:13,771 --> 00:29:16,350
they all bought into it
because you got a problem.

912
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,820
We're gonna solve your problem.

913
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:20,120
So we are needed and we are valued all.

914
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:25,110
So you had all of these
sort of constituencies from
society benefiting from the

915
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:27,870
vilification or an escape
goating of crack cocaine.

916
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:31,980
All of those things think came together
nicely and then we think about the

917
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:32,814
wrappers.

918
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,730
They all came into the
game too because it's like,

919
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:36,870
I'm conscious,

920
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,290
I'm going to say that this is a problem
in my community and I care about my

921
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:43,570
community and this is the
way that I can show it.

922
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,990
So everybody had a stake
in this sort of thing.

923
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:47,820
Wow.

924
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,770
That is absolutely fascinating.

925
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,113
You know,

926
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,380
one of the things that I've,

927
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,540
I've talked to quite a few people
about when it comes to issues like real

928
00:29:57,541 --> 00:30:02,541
complex issues like drug addiction and
violence and poverty is that once you

929
00:30:03,631 --> 00:30:06,000
feed it with any organism,

930
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:10,050
whether it's that organism is law
enforcement or that organism is education,

931
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,450
whichever one you feed is
the one that's going to grow.

932
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,400
And once you feed the law enforcement
one and you look at this really complex

933
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:18,234
situation,

934
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,800
I think law enforcement is important,

935
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,790
but I think education is probably
more important to avoid future law

936
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:24,361
enforcement.

937
00:30:24,361 --> 00:30:26,670
Like the more I think the
more education we have,

938
00:30:26,671 --> 00:30:27,211
the the,

939
00:30:27,211 --> 00:30:32,211
the more nuanced our ability to raise
children is the more we understand that

940
00:30:32,761 --> 00:30:33,780
we're all in this together,

941
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,400
the less you're going
to need law enforcement.

942
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:39,330
But when law enforcement becomes
this machine that lobbies against the

943
00:30:39,331 --> 00:30:41,100
legalization of certain drugs,

944
00:30:41,101 --> 00:30:43,200
which when you start looking at the data,

945
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,940
there's only one reason to do that.

946
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:47,880
And the only reason is that
you're trying to stay alive.

947
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,080
You're trying to grow,

948
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,950
you're an organism,

949
00:30:49,951 --> 00:30:50,550
you're trying,

950
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,650
you're trying to eat the sugar
that's trying to keep going.

951
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,610
So you're creating more jobs
by putting people in jail.

952
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,480
It's essentially,

953
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,100
no one wants to look at it like this,

954
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,240
but it's a form of slavery.

955
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,040
Uh,

956
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,900
I think we,

957
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,440
uh,

958
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,820
in the house I live in the film,

959
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:05,200
Eugene Gr direct these films.

960
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,620
I think that's the kind of analogy
he was trying to draw in that film.

961
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:09,221
Absolutely.

962
00:31:09,221 --> 00:31:11,290
So I think we get it.

963
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,000
I think a number of people get that.

964
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:14,620
That's exactly what it is.

965
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:15,361
Yeah.

966
00:31:15,361 --> 00:31:19,050
It's exactly what it is and it doesn't
seem like anybody's willing to address

967
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:19,230
it.

968
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:19,621
No one,

969
00:31:19,621 --> 00:31:20,760
no one's willing to change it.

970
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,590
There's that very famous
speech where Eisenhower,

971
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:27,590
it gets out of office and as he's
leaving he addresses the nation.

972
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,660
He warns of the dangers of the
military industrial complex.

973
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,640
And it's a weird speech because this is
a sitting president and he's leaving and

974
00:31:35,641 --> 00:31:36,590
he's letting people know,

975
00:31:36,591 --> 00:31:40,410
like there's a machine out here that's
growing and I'm letting I can clue you

976
00:31:40,411 --> 00:31:41,150
into this.

977
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,660
Like be aware of this thing.

978
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:43,231
This,

979
00:31:43,231 --> 00:31:44,820
the same with law enforcement.

980
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,530
It's the same with private prisons.

981
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:47,130
It's a,

982
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,990
they become organisms.

983
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:53,760
They'd become individual things that are
filled with people that are all working

984
00:31:53,761 --> 00:31:55,980
for the greater good of
the individual of the,

985
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:57,330
of the Great Corporation.

986
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,221
Absolutely.

987
00:31:58,221 --> 00:32:01,640
And people need to understand the conflict
of interest that these folks have.

988
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:05,120
And oftentimes when we have
these type types of discussions,

989
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,700
one or to sort of
impulses of the media or,

990
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,540
or uh,

991
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,810
folks who have these discussions that
they want to invite law enforcement

992
00:32:11,811 --> 00:32:12,370
personnel.

993
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:17,370
It's like what expertise do they
have to talk about drugs really run

994
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,370
none.

995
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,200
Well you remember Ronald
Reagan when he was on TV.

996
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,320
Mara Mana may very well be one of the
most dangerous drugs we've ever discovered

997
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,270
or that or whatever the exact yeah,

998
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:28,761
no,

999
00:32:28,761 --> 00:32:29,031
no.

1000
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:29,181
I,

1001
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:29,781
I know,

1002
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,201
you know,

1003
00:32:30,201 --> 00:32:32,370
I try to forget Ronald Reagan but I,

1004
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,500
I hear you,

1005
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:37,950
I had a conversation today about an
actors with a friend and we were talking

1006
00:32:37,951 --> 00:32:40,310
about actors being in politics.

1007
00:32:40,311 --> 00:32:44,750
Like how crazy it is that you let someone
who's a professional liar try to tell

1008
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:45,441
people the truth.

1009
00:32:45,441 --> 00:32:49,160
I mean that's what an actor is
a really good at bullshitting.

1010
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,610
Like they pretend they're really sad
cause someone they know just died.

1011
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:54,560
Nobody fucking dive as
cameras all around you.

1012
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:55,361
There's lights on you,

1013
00:32:55,361 --> 00:32:56,210
you wear makeup,

1014
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,350
but you're so good at bullshitting that
I'm willing to pay money to see you.

1015
00:33:00,351 --> 00:33:01,184
Bullshit.

1016
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,120
I mean,

1017
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,330
let's think about what we
consider news in the country.

1018
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,910
And we think about the people
who are delivering news.

1019
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,140
They are the same.

1020
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,870
They're worse.

1021
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,690
They're too stupid to be actors,

1022
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,530
right?

1023
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,400
Most of them are,

1024
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,300
you know,

1025
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,740
and here's Bob with the weather.

1026
00:33:15,741 --> 00:33:16,191
Wow.

1027
00:33:16,191 --> 00:33:17,001
What a day,

1028
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:17,751
what a day,

1029
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:18,351
what a day.

1030
00:33:18,351 --> 00:33:22,220
The wind's coming in from the northeast
and I do these radio tours and I'm sure

1031
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:23,390
you do them as well when you,

1032
00:33:23,391 --> 00:33:23,720
uh,

1033
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,770
you promote your books,

1034
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,130
but you will hear the same voice
over and over and over again.

1035
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:32,630
It's like somehow none of these guys
have plugged into what they think is a

1036
00:33:32,631 --> 00:33:35,000
radio guy and they're being,

1037
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:38,600
they're playing the role of a
radio guy and it's very strange.

1038
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:39,581
Yeah.

1039
00:33:39,581 --> 00:33:42,660
There's a lot of strays things that has
happened on this book tour is though.

1040
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:43,790
Yeah.

1041
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,550
So that's the people that we
have disseminating information.

1042
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,870
And in some cases,

1043
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,231
uh,

1044
00:33:48,231 --> 00:33:49,280
running the government,

1045
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,150
you know,

1046
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,370
the Arnold sports and
everything was so crazy.

1047
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:52,911
You know,

1048
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:55,880
we're running around telling everybody
the fucking terminator is the governor of

1049
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:56,331
the country.

1050
00:33:56,331 --> 00:33:58,310
That's ridiculous,

1051
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,173
you know.

1052
00:33:59,630 --> 00:33:59,901
Yeah.

1053
00:33:59,901 --> 00:34:04,310
There's so much to say about the honor
sweat sneaker as it relates to drugs too.

1054
00:34:04,311 --> 00:34:07,370
When we think particularly we think
about performance enhancing drugs and no

1055
00:34:07,371 --> 00:34:08,204
discounts of thing.

1056
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:08,781
You know,

1057
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:13,250
we know about his shoes and then you
think about the PA cracy of it all.

1058
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:17,660
And that's the thing that's
just disturbing if people
just call it like it is

1059
00:34:17,661 --> 00:34:18,890
and say what it is,

1060
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:23,330
you actually help people understand what
these things do and what they don't do.

1061
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,620
And then you don't have that.

1062
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,380
People have all of this
cognitive dissonance about,

1063
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,280
uh,

1064
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,581
it's like,

1065
00:34:28,581 --> 00:34:29,990
how can I get to that level?

1066
00:34:29,991 --> 00:34:31,430
How can I do this level?

1067
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,450
Um,

1068
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:32,990
uh,

1069
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:33,560
when you,

1070
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,120
when you know that those folks,

1071
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:35,820
um,

1072
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,140
uh,

1073
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,750
did performance enhancing drugs,

1074
00:34:37,751 --> 00:34:40,640
so now they're saying that you shouldn't
do performance enhancing drugs.

1075
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:40,911
Yeah,

1076
00:34:40,911 --> 00:34:42,620
that's an interesting situation.

1077
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,030
Um,

1078
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,460
I,

1079
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,040
I think there's a real issue with
that in sports and there's a bunch of

1080
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:47,750
different groups that are
trying to clean it up.

1081
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:52,751
And recently the UFC has made a big
steps to try to limit the amount of

1082
00:34:52,941 --> 00:34:54,020
performance enhancing drugs.

1083
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,990
But unless you're watching
gars all day every day,

1084
00:34:56,991 --> 00:34:59,270
it's really hard to tell
without testing them.

1085
00:34:59,660 --> 00:34:59,841
Well,

1086
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:00,171
you know,

1087
00:35:00,171 --> 00:35:03,520
I don't know how I feel about the
performance enhancing drugs thinking.

1088
00:35:03,521 --> 00:35:07,520
The thing that I like to know first of
all is that we get better information on

1089
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:07,640
it.

1090
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:07,971
You know,

1091
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:12,290
and I don't want to have this sort of
just say no attitude towards this stuff

1092
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:14,510
without really good information.

1093
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,280
And I don't know if we're there yet.

1094
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,750
I agree with you 100%.

1095
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,360
I think the issue that people
will have though is the,

1096
00:35:20,361 --> 00:35:21,410
the term natural,

1097
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,251
you know,

1098
00:35:22,251 --> 00:35:25,400
natural is an interesting term because
is it still natural if you're taking

1099
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:26,270
multivitamins,

1100
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,370
but what if you got
creatines it's still natural.

1101
00:35:28,371 --> 00:35:29,151
If you drink coffee,

1102
00:35:29,151 --> 00:35:31,400
coffee's a drug you're kind of drug using.

1103
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,680
Is it still natural if you use,

1104
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:34,370
you know,

1105
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:38,370
certain types of water that's treated
certain ways to make your body process

1106
00:35:38,371 --> 00:35:39,181
oxygen better?

1107
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:43,140
I mean whatever new thing that comes
out is that still natural and it gets,

1108
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,070
it gets real weird.

1109
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,330
It's like she should be,

1110
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:49,320
should people not be allowed to take any
supplements so they just only have food

1111
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,430
like this is what you give them.

1112
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:54,990
Just plants and animal protein and water
and then we monitor what your diet is

1113
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:55,824
and then we let you fight.

1114
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,310
Yeah.

1115
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,150
You know there are,

1116
00:35:58,151 --> 00:36:01,030
there are a number of issues going on
because I mean the whole notion of like

1117
00:36:01,031 --> 00:36:01,541
natural,

1118
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:02,860
I think people need to grow up.

1119
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:04,240
I don't even know what that means.

1120
00:36:04,241 --> 00:36:05,074
Natural.

1121
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,670
That's not my concern.

1122
00:36:06,671 --> 00:36:11,530
My concern is that if you have performance
enhancing drugs and then people are

1123
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,393
giving,

1124
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,760
given a drug in order to so they can
continue to perform even though they are

1125
00:36:15,761 --> 00:36:16,594
hurt.

1126
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,020
That's my concern that they,

1127
00:36:18,021 --> 00:36:21,790
that we run further a risk of
having people being injured.

1128
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:23,860
But in terms of training
and that sort of thing,

1129
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,520
I don't have so much an issue
with that whole issue of,

1130
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,650
of using performance enhancing drugs.

1131
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,330
As long as we're doing it in a safe
manner in which people understand what's

1132
00:36:34,331 --> 00:36:35,164
happening.

1133
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:35,801
I think the,

1134
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:35,951
uh,

1135
00:36:35,951 --> 00:36:37,270
the question is fairness.

1136
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,170
That's the question.

1137
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:38,650
You know,

1138
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,930
fairness Americans are,

1139
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:41,843
um,

1140
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:42,400
they,

1141
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,070
they annoy me with fairness.

1142
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:47,080
I mean fairness really come on

1143
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,600
worried that someone is going to cheat
and they're going to win when they're

1144
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:51,800
taking an illegal drug.

1145
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,311
That's the,

1146
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:52,521
I mean,

1147
00:36:52,521 --> 00:36:53,354
it's pretty simple.

1148
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:54,973
That's the fairness.

1149
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,910
That's the fairness argument.

1150
00:36:56,911 --> 00:36:58,530
So like when we think about,

1151
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,220
uh,

1152
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:03,720
our ability in this country to train
better than some of our opponents in the

1153
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,060
Olympics because we are
a wealthier country.

1154
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,410
Is that fair?

1155
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,070
No,

1156
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:08,491
definitely not.

1157
00:37:08,491 --> 00:37:08,701
Yeah.

1158
00:37:08,701 --> 00:37:09,331
So I mean,

1159
00:37:09,331 --> 00:37:12,400
just hold it and then we think
about wealthy or people who,

1160
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,370
who his kids can have,

1161
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,150
uh,

1162
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,230
access to,

1163
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:16,470
uh,

1164
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:21,470
prep tests before taking the sat before
taking the m cat or some other exam,

1165
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,290
whereas a less wealthy people
can't afford those tests.

1166
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:26,124
Is that fair?

1167
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:26,800
Absolutely.

1168
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,410
Just so issue of fairness is

1169
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,700
come on right when it comes to combat
sports and athletics though obviously I

1170
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:34,560
have a vested interest in um,

1171
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,330
in this idea and this debate,

1172
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,660
but I think there is an issue
of two guys have very similar,

1173
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,880
almost identical economic situations,

1174
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:42,810
uh,

1175
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,640
identical training environments,

1176
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:45,241
uh,

1177
00:37:45,241 --> 00:37:47,400
identical amount of
experience in martial arts.

1178
00:37:47,401 --> 00:37:49,170
And one guy's taking a drug
and the other guy isn't,

1179
00:37:49,171 --> 00:37:50,940
that guy has an unfair advantage.

1180
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:51,661
Sure.

1181
00:37:51,661 --> 00:37:52,640
Certainly can be.

1182
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,980
But you know the thing and that's fine.

1183
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,250
Whatever the rules are now
we must adhere to them.

1184
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,570
All I'm saying is that I think that we
need to make sure that we studied the

1185
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:06,970
issue really well so that if one
person has access to anything to add

1186
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,640
and also should have access,

1187
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,950
but right now the rules
are that you can't,

1188
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,083
that's fine.

1189
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:12,540
Right.

1190
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,040
So I totally understand.

1191
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:17,580
So what you're saying is you think that
the rules should be based on scientific

1192
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:22,581
evidence of efficacy and of
health benefits and risks
and all that and have it

1193
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,240
laid out and absolutely not.

1194
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,080
Absolutely.

1195
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,241
Yeah,

1196
00:38:25,241 --> 00:38:25,741
it really is.

1197
00:38:25,741 --> 00:38:26,880
It is kind of a weird thing.

1198
00:38:26,881 --> 00:38:27,900
Like you can sell test.

1199
00:38:27,901 --> 00:38:31,950
Like on it we sell a t plus enhancer it
and it enhances your body's ability to

1200
00:38:31,951 --> 00:38:32,880
produce testosterone.

1201
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,953
But it's legal.

1202
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,160
I mean there is a bunch of stuff.

1203
00:38:36,161 --> 00:38:36,970
The like creatine,

1204
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:37,691
creatine is legal.

1205
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:37,901
You can,

1206
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:38,381
they can't stop.

1207
00:38:38,381 --> 00:38:39,214
You've taken creating,

1208
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,480
there's a bunch of stuff that,

1209
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,041
you know,

1210
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:41,681
it caffeine,

1211
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:43,000
they'll let you take a certain amount,

1212
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,220
but if you get above like 200
milligrams in your system,

1213
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:45,461
they go,

1214
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:45,971
oh no,

1215
00:38:45,971 --> 00:38:47,560
you don't like too much.

1216
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,450
It's real weird.

1217
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,493
Natural is a weird

1218
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,020
word.

1219
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:51,231
Yeah,

1220
00:38:51,231 --> 00:38:51,481
no,

1221
00:38:51,481 --> 00:38:51,730
right.

1222
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,081
I know.

1223
00:38:52,081 --> 00:38:52,370
You know,

1224
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,600
it's a difficult one for me.

1225
00:38:53,601 --> 00:38:55,790
I don't know the
performance enhancing whirl,

1226
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,450
uh,

1227
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,830
as well as I'd like to.

1228
00:38:57,831 --> 00:38:58,401
But you know,

1229
00:38:58,401 --> 00:39:00,140
maybe that's an issue for another book.

1230
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:00,890
Well,

1231
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:01,281
you know,

1232
00:39:01,281 --> 00:39:01,551
this,

1233
00:39:01,551 --> 00:39:02,480
the term natural,

1234
00:39:02,481 --> 00:39:03,000
I got a,

1235
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,220
a conversation with a friend of mine.

1236
00:39:04,221 --> 00:39:07,160
We were talking about pollution and all
these different things that people do

1237
00:39:07,161 --> 00:39:07,281
and,

1238
00:39:07,281 --> 00:39:08,240
and we were saying,

1239
00:39:08,241 --> 00:39:12,500
what's really kind of weird is we always
think of things that humans make as

1240
00:39:12,501 --> 00:39:13,334
unnatural,

1241
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,980
but they're all made
out of stuff on earth.

1242
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:19,580
It's not like we're taking shit from
another dimension and creating artificial

1243
00:39:19,581 --> 00:39:20,120
things.

1244
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:20,470
Yeah.

1245
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,340
Just like in the marijuana smokers,

1246
00:39:22,341 --> 00:39:22,671
they say,

1247
00:39:22,671 --> 00:39:24,140
well we is natural,

1248
00:39:24,141 --> 00:39:26,270
so does all drugs are natural.

1249
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:26,751
You know,

1250
00:39:26,751 --> 00:39:29,540
it's like heroin comes
from the opium poppy,

1251
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,990
methamphetamine from a federal base plant,

1252
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,411
you know,

1253
00:39:33,411 --> 00:39:36,710
cocaine from the coca plant as well.

1254
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,650
So it's like all of
these things are natural,

1255
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,270
if that's what your definition of natural,

1256
00:39:41,271 --> 00:39:44,840
even this synthetic versions are
created by earth grown components.

1257
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,621
Absolutely.

1258
00:39:45,621 --> 00:39:47,930
Just synthetic versions might be better.

1259
00:39:47,931 --> 00:39:49,000
I mean like aspirin,

1260
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,670
uh,

1261
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,680
comes from the willow bark,

1262
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:52,640
I believe it's like,

1263
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,510
but we have made it since synthetic,

1264
00:39:54,511 --> 00:39:58,550
so we can harness dude the
components that we need.

1265
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:58,970
Uh,

1266
00:39:58,970 --> 00:39:59,710
so that's,

1267
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:00,543
that's a good thing.

1268
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,573
And that's a drug.

1269
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,473
Yes.

1270
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:02,721
Yeah.

1271
00:40:02,721 --> 00:40:04,730
So a drug free America
would mean no Asprin,

1272
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,593
no aspirin.

1273
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,453
That's right.

1274
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,120
It is pretty silly.

1275
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:09,770
No d no coca cola either.

1276
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,180
Yup.

1277
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:10,310
Yeah.

1278
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:10,970
That's a drug.

1279
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:11,660
That's right.

1280
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,800
We're filled with it.

1281
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:13,640
That's right.

1282
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,900
Our culture is filled with it.

1283
00:40:14,901 --> 00:40:16,790
And that's such a great
point that you made earlier.

1284
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:18,050
Every single culture.

1285
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,011
Absolutely.

1286
00:40:19,011 --> 00:40:23,360
So like kids who are trying to learn how
to think critically when people present

1287
00:40:23,361 --> 00:40:24,800
them with things like drug free,

1288
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,900
they should really question
that sort of thing.

1289
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:27,670
Um,

1290
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:27,890
uh,

1291
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:31,100
that they should be taught that
this is part of critical thinking,

1292
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,950
drug free societies just doesn't exist.

1293
00:40:33,951 --> 00:40:37,280
So please don't feed me propaganda.

1294
00:40:37,281 --> 00:40:39,170
So that really does exacerbate our issue,

1295
00:40:39,171 --> 00:40:39,500
right?

1296
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,333
Because uh,

1297
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:40,820
it,

1298
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,500
with all that ignorance out there,

1299
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:45,530
it makes it very difficult to have a real
debate about it because people come in

1300
00:40:45,531 --> 00:40:47,300
to everything with preconceived notions.

1301
00:40:47,301 --> 00:40:47,870
Like,

1302
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:48,703
I don't,

1303
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,160
I don't know very much at all about chess.

1304
00:40:51,161 --> 00:40:52,750
I don't know who's the best,

1305
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:54,340
I don't know what the strategies are.

1306
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:57,040
I kind of know how the things
move that makes two of us,

1307
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:58,931
you know what I'm saying?

1308
00:40:58,931 --> 00:41:01,180
But if I came into chess going,

1309
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:01,361
oh,

1310
00:41:01,361 --> 00:41:01,511
no,

1311
00:41:01,511 --> 00:41:01,630
no,

1312
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:01,811
no,

1313
00:41:01,811 --> 00:41:03,610
you guys don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

1314
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:05,090
Like the way to do chest,

1315
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,850
you gotta just move
faster than the other guy.

1316
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:07,930
I had all this crazy,

1317
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,160
oh,

1318
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,930
I'm fucking been watching on
TV and you're a chess master.

1319
00:41:10,931 --> 00:41:11,261
You'd be like,

1320
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:11,441
pitch,

1321
00:41:11,441 --> 00:41:11,931
what are you say?

1322
00:41:11,931 --> 00:41:13,510
And that is not how you play chess.

1323
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,580
The fuck you talking
about crack babies man,

1324
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:16,630
the crack economy,

1325
00:41:16,631 --> 00:41:18,580
you telling me crack crack
didn't ruin our economy.

1326
00:41:18,581 --> 00:41:19,720
Broke shut the fuck up.

1327
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:23,920
It's like people already have this in
their head like they're already coming to

1328
00:41:23,921 --> 00:41:25,480
the table with a bunch of bullshit.

1329
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,110
I couldn't have said it any better man.

1330
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,080
It's gotta be really frustrating when
you go to cocktail parties and if I had a

1331
00:41:32,081 --> 00:41:32,660
cocktail party,

1332
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,920
I invite you to look cool,

1333
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,843
cool guy.

1334
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,070
If you go to cocktail
parties and people say,

1335
00:41:37,071 --> 00:41:37,450
well car,

1336
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,240
what'd he do?

1337
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:38,930
And he'd go out,

1338
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:39,350
you know,

1339
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,183
I'm a

1340
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:42,920
shoe salesman,

1341
00:41:42,921 --> 00:41:43,754
man.

1342
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,800
That's a good way to get out of it.

1343
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,610
I used to tell Chickson I worked for
my father's insurance company because

1344
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,980
working for an insurance
company is so unglamorous,

1345
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,980
but working for your father's insurance
company means you're such a bitch,

1346
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:57,170
you can't even get your own
job and insurance company.

1347
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:57,831
He just,

1348
00:41:57,831 --> 00:42:02,060
some Ne'er do well that lives
in his parents' basement
and they would be so mean

1349
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:02,720
to me.

1350
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,130
It was so crazy.

1351
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:05,410
This is what I was on television.

1352
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:06,261
They be like,

1353
00:42:06,261 --> 00:42:06,531
Yo,

1354
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:07,970
you got to inherit the company.

1355
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,620
I should probably be push up.

1356
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,250
Nope.

1357
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:10,540
Nope.

1358
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,720
And there was none of that going on.

1359
00:42:11,721 --> 00:42:12,700
I wasn't flashy enough.

1360
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,543
I didn't have enough shit.

1361
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:17,090
If I was like pulling up in a Ferrari and
I said that maybe then they'd be like,

1362
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,420
hmm.

1363
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,450
I was driving up Volkswagon
Corrado at the time.

1364
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,320
I just,

1365
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,650
it was shocking how mean people
could be because of that we have,

1366
00:42:24,651 --> 00:42:25,100
uh,

1367
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:25,550
you know,

1368
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:28,760
certain things that we accept and
certain things we don't accept.

1369
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,050
And when it comes to,

1370
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:30,270
you know,

1371
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:32,630
things that people talk about at
cocktail parties and what have you.

1372
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:34,250
And if someone comes along and says,

1373
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:37,970
heroin's not that addictive
cocaine doesn't ruin a lot.

1374
00:42:37,971 --> 00:42:39,230
A lot of people take on a regular basis,

1375
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:42,260
you're going to encounter a
bunch a know it all right,

1376
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:43,370
don't you?

1377
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:44,091
You must.

1378
00:42:44,091 --> 00:42:44,770
Of course.

1379
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,550
Do you know?

1380
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:46,383
Um,

1381
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,373
so I mean,

1382
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:47,710
uh,

1383
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:52,450
so that means that I have to make sure
that I don't engage in conversations with

1384
00:42:52,451 --> 00:42:55,270
people who don't play by
the rules of evidence.

1385
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,740
And so if I engage,

1386
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,810
if I engage in those
kinds of conversation,

1387
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,700
I'm too old for that man.

1388
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,300
And so I try to limit my
exposure to people who are,

1389
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:05,830
who are um,

1390
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,160
uh,

1391
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,200
mainly faith base in there,

1392
00:43:08,201 --> 00:43:09,700
sort of a belief system.

1393
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:09,890
It

1394
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:12,800
becomes a real problem when they're
really smart about something else.

1395
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:15,520
Like I had a conversation
with Michio Kaku once and uh,

1396
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,170
we were talking about Panspermia,

1397
00:43:18,171 --> 00:43:19,820
it was a on the opiate Anthony show,

1398
00:43:19,821 --> 00:43:23,450
we're talking about the concept of the
building blocks of life coming in from

1399
00:43:23,451 --> 00:43:27,500
asteroids and that that might be
where a lot of things came from.

1400
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:28,661
And,

1401
00:43:28,661 --> 00:43:28,830
uh,

1402
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,980
one of the things that
we were discussing was,

1403
00:43:30,981 --> 00:43:32,510
was psychedelic mushrooms.

1404
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:37,660
Cause Terence Mckenna had this theory
about psychedelic mushrooms coming spores

1405
00:43:38,091 --> 00:43:39,050
coming from another planet.

1406
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:42,260
It's very possible that asteroid impacts
that carried all the other building

1407
00:43:42,261 --> 00:43:44,450
blocks for life also
carried psychedelic spores,

1408
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,360
which is why they're so uniquely
different from any other plants on earth.

1409
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,280
And I was asking him if
he ever did mushrooms,

1410
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,890
my sneaky way of asking Michio
Kaku if he did mushrooms,

1411
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,820
but he started going off about it given
you brain damage and becoming addictive.

1412
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,091
And I'm like,

1413
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,410
what are the fuck you talking about?

1414
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,270
It's so unfortunate like that.

1415
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:01,010
He was talking about it ruining your mind.

1416
00:44:01,011 --> 00:44:02,300
Like I'm trying to improve my mind.

1417
00:44:02,301 --> 00:44:02,540
I'm like,

1418
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:02,721
oh,

1419
00:44:02,721 --> 00:44:03,554
come sir,

1420
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:04,430
please.

1421
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:04,641
You're,

1422
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:04,881
you're,

1423
00:44:04,881 --> 00:44:06,920
you're like a blind man
describing in kaleidoscope.

1424
00:44:06,921 --> 00:44:08,630
And it unfortunately,

1425
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,830
it makes you question all the things that
that guy's an expert in because if you

1426
00:44:12,831 --> 00:44:14,600
know something to be untrue,

1427
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:19,410
and here's this brilliant guy who's
telling you about the universe itself and

1428
00:44:19,411 --> 00:44:19,640
the,

1429
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:24,500
the building blocks of matter and he's
so smart and he's so definitive with his,

1430
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,160
his,

1431
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,530
his definitions and
descriptions of these things.

1432
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:31,860
But then he tells you something that you
absolutely know to be incorrect and you

1433
00:44:31,861 --> 00:44:32,070
go,

1434
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:32,221
well,

1435
00:44:32,221 --> 00:44:32,880
come on.

1436
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,550
Where's this is your fucking awesome?

1437
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:36,271
Why are you saying this?

1438
00:44:36,271 --> 00:44:38,100
Like you're the one who's
telling me about the cosmos.

1439
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:42,150
You're telling me about all these other
cool things that I know are amazing and

1440
00:44:42,151 --> 00:44:43,500
scientifically provable.

1441
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,990
But now you're saying some dumb
shit as well and which you man,

1442
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:47,843
I mean,

1443
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:50,940
that's one of the things that we
all try to guard against because,

1444
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:51,600
uh,

1445
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,330
we all have a limited
sort of knowledge base.

1446
00:44:54,331 --> 00:44:55,021
We all do.

1447
00:44:55,021 --> 00:44:55,261
I mean,

1448
00:44:55,261 --> 00:44:57,630
we can only be experts in so many areas.

1449
00:44:57,631 --> 00:44:57,931
I mean,

1450
00:44:57,931 --> 00:45:01,230
it's just requires so much work
to be an expert in anything.

1451
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,680
And so we have to have
the humility to say,

1452
00:45:04,681 --> 00:45:04,951
you know,

1453
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:05,910
I don't know that as well,

1454
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:08,880
but I'm willing to keep
an open mind and learn.

1455
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:09,661
Um,

1456
00:45:09,661 --> 00:45:10,800
so you're right.

1457
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:11,111
Uh,

1458
00:45:11,111 --> 00:45:15,630
I hope that I don't overreach like that
on any subject matter because I know

1459
00:45:15,631 --> 00:45:16,770
drugs very well.

1460
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,570
Other things I know less well,

1461
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,470
that's such an important thing and a lot
of really smart people don't ever want

1462
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:23,304
to admit that.

1463
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:23,731
You know,

1464
00:45:23,731 --> 00:45:26,340
there's a lot of really smart people
that are really smart about one thing,

1465
00:45:26,341 --> 00:45:28,920
so that you question him about things
that they're not really smart about,

1466
00:45:28,921 --> 00:45:31,830
where they don't really have as
much information about the bullshit.

1467
00:45:31,831 --> 00:45:34,110
Sometimes that's fucking dangerous.

1468
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:34,321
Um,

1469
00:45:34,321 --> 00:45:35,150
which you man,

1470
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,440
and I'm so glad that you,

1471
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:41,470
you expose that kind of thing and you
highlight the concern related to that.

1472
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,170
But you know,

1473
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:43,531
that's,

1474
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:44,364
uh,

1475
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:45,480
we have to be able to say,

1476
00:45:45,481 --> 00:45:46,140
I don't know.

1477
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:46,321
Yeah,

1478
00:45:46,321 --> 00:45:46,501
it's,

1479
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:46,921
it's,

1480
00:45:46,921 --> 00:45:47,220
it's,

1481
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,110
it's an important factor.

1482
00:45:49,111 --> 00:45:51,450
Like in distributing information,

1483
00:45:51,451 --> 00:45:53,670
we have to know that these
sources that we reach,

1484
00:45:53,671 --> 00:45:57,300
whether it's you or any other academic
is a hundred percent honest and there's

1485
00:45:57,301 --> 00:45:58,800
no ego or fuckery involved.

1486
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:01,890
And when these guys show a little bit
of ego where they don't want to show

1487
00:46:01,891 --> 00:46:03,690
humility about their ignorance,

1488
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,090
they ruined the whole thing.

1489
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,460
The whole discussion gets,

1490
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:08,040
it's,

1491
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,890
it's very difficult to
take them as seriously.

1492
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:11,520
Absolutely.

1493
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,270
And it waters down all the things that
they say that you know are true as well.

1494
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:15,720
It's like,

1495
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,021
yeah.

1496
00:46:16,021 --> 00:46:16,291
You know,

1497
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:21,030
on the one hand it's like we should
be allowed the latitude to be,

1498
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:22,260
to have been wrong,

1499
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:23,850
but as a result,

1500
00:46:23,851 --> 00:46:25,500
we should also be able to say,

1501
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:25,771
Oh,

1502
00:46:25,771 --> 00:46:26,041
you know,

1503
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:30,270
I was wrong and I got this new
information that made me see the light.

1504
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:31,230
Um,

1505
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:31,711
and so,

1506
00:46:31,711 --> 00:46:33,150
so it's a two way street.

1507
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:33,601
You know,

1508
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:37,740
it's like people are gonna make mistakes
and we want them to be able to make the

1509
00:46:37,741 --> 00:46:41,970
mistakes because in the process
of trying to understand something,

1510
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,310
they might discover
something really fascinating,

1511
00:46:44,311 --> 00:46:45,144
a good,

1512
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:45,601
um,

1513
00:46:45,601 --> 00:46:47,160
and so they should be
able to make a mistake,

1514
00:46:47,161 --> 00:46:48,750
but they have to also be able to say,

1515
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,573
I screwed up.

1516
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:50,881
Yeah.

1517
00:46:50,881 --> 00:46:52,020
It's really unique isn't it?

1518
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:53,340
When people were running for president,

1519
00:46:53,341 --> 00:46:54,480
we don't want none of that.

1520
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:56,240
We want no flip flop in.

1521
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:00,570
If you're a flip flopper we don't want
to think that anybody learn from their

1522
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:04,080
mistakes and change their opinion or had
some new information come in and they

1523
00:47:04,081 --> 00:47:05,220
reconsidered their ideas.

1524
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,200
Eh,

1525
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,200
one of the people who say that disk
I flip flopped or this and that,

1526
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:14,340
they don't speak for me and I hope they
don't speak for the rest of the country,

1527
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:16,350
although they may have the microphone,

1528
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:19,770
but I hope people see
through that nonsense.

1529
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,251
They do.

1530
00:47:20,251 --> 00:47:21,084
But there are,

1531
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:24,120
I think what they're trying
to get at for the most part.

1532
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:24,361
I mean,

1533
00:47:24,361 --> 00:47:24,841
I think we're,

1534
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:25,051
we're,

1535
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:27,480
we're certainly right when it
comes to like you can learn,

1536
00:47:27,481 --> 00:47:28,291
you can change your opinion.

1537
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:30,220
I certainly they've in my life and even

1538
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:32,170
recently changed my opinions on things,

1539
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:36,670
but I think they're just concerned which
bullshit politicians that are just did

1540
00:47:36,671 --> 00:47:38,410
just completely play in the breeze.

1541
00:47:38,411 --> 00:47:39,480
That's where's it going?

1542
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,670
I'm pro abortion.

1543
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,230
Uh,

1544
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:42,431
none.

1545
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:42,611
None,

1546
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:42,791
none.

1547
00:47:42,791 --> 00:47:43,031
None.

1548
00:47:43,031 --> 00:47:43,270
None.

1549
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:43,451
No,

1550
00:47:43,451 --> 00:47:43,631
no,

1551
00:47:43,631 --> 00:47:44,021
that's right.

1552
00:47:44,021 --> 00:47:46,180
So you have that issue where people are,

1553
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,441
like you said,

1554
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:47,981
they are,

1555
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:48,340
uh,

1556
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:51,790
trying to make sure they have all the
bases covered and they say one message to

1557
00:47:51,791 --> 00:47:54,460
one group and a completely
different message to another group.

1558
00:47:54,461 --> 00:47:55,750
I know I get that.

1559
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:00,100
But then there are politicians to who
actually learned new information to change

1560
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:02,950
their mind and then they get caught
the flip flopper and that's bad.

1561
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:03,391
Now,

1562
00:48:03,391 --> 00:48:04,650
when did you first,

1563
00:48:04,651 --> 00:48:06,360
when did you do your first research,

1564
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:06,961
your first,

1565
00:48:06,961 --> 00:48:07,380
uh,

1566
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:10,050
like research on drug effects?

1567
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:13,800
I think the first study
I published was in 1992.

1568
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,910
And what was the climate like then
in comparison to climate in 2014?

1569
00:48:17,911 --> 00:48:19,410
Cause we were talking about pre internet.

1570
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:20,303
Yeah.

1571
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:21,001
Damn,

1572
00:48:21,001 --> 00:48:21,840
that's pretty internet.

1573
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:23,230
Al Gore hadn't,

1574
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:24,510
he didn't just go up to discovered it.

1575
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,850
And that night I ate to Al Gore,

1576
00:48:26,851 --> 00:48:27,684
probably already had it,

1577
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,510
probably only had a
cell phone with an arm.

1578
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:30,420
Um,

1579
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:30,900
I think,

1580
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:35,900
well I got on in 94 and I
think it's generally considered
like 93 was when I say

1581
00:48:36,361 --> 00:48:36,961
pre Internet.

1582
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:41,520
Like I think it all started around that
area on the attitudes hadn't really

1583
00:48:41,521 --> 00:48:41,760
changed.

1584
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,181
Nah,

1585
00:48:42,181 --> 00:48:43,230
I mean the attitudes,

1586
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,090
the attitudes around drugs,

1587
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:46,290
they haven't really,

1588
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:47,400
I mean,

1589
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,530
only until the past year or two
have they really started to change.

1590
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:56,430
People here are two people
of like starting to open
their mind to these issues.

1591
00:48:56,431 --> 00:48:58,050
Like maybe we'd been hoodwinked,

1592
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,490
maybe we've been bamboozled,

1593
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,560
but for a long time.

1594
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:06,590
I mean we think about from Reagan
to Bush one to Clinton to Bush to,

1595
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:09,960
uh,

1596
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,080
and even Obama at the
beginning of his first term,

1597
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:13,800
um,

1598
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,940
attitudes about drugs,

1599
00:49:14,941 --> 00:49:16,320
they hadn't changed that much.

1600
00:49:16,321 --> 00:49:16,681
I mean,

1601
00:49:16,681 --> 00:49:19,590
the bottom line was that drugs were bad.

1602
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,270
And as a politician,

1603
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:25,290
what you say is that you're going to be
tough on drug drug users and people who

1604
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:26,124
sell drugs.

1605
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,000
And that's,

1606
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,580
that was popular until recently.

1607
00:49:29,581 --> 00:49:31,170
Now people were starting to say,

1608
00:49:31,171 --> 00:49:31,411
wait,

1609
00:49:31,411 --> 00:49:32,100
wait a second.

1610
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,240
Maybe we have,

1611
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,790
maybe we've been doing this wrong.

1612
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:35,960
And,

1613
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,350
but that's a recent phenomenon.

1614
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:37,921
Do you,

1615
00:49:37,921 --> 00:49:40,490
what do you attribute the
terrain changing of that tied to,

1616
00:49:40,491 --> 00:49:42,360
is it just the overwhelming information?

1617
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:43,703
I think

1618
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:44,230
there,

1619
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:45,290
there are a few things.

1620
00:49:45,291 --> 00:49:45,501
I,

1621
00:49:45,501 --> 00:49:46,071
I think,

1622
00:49:46,071 --> 00:49:46,904
um,

1623
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:51,200
Michelle Alexander wrote an important
book called the new Jim Crow to help

1624
00:49:51,201 --> 00:49:56,201
people to understand the fact that we now
have 2.3 million people in our prisons

1625
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,660
and largely because of the war on drugs,

1626
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:00,321
you know,

1627
00:50:00,321 --> 00:50:02,900
so it's like we have 5%
of the world's population,

1628
00:50:02,901 --> 00:50:05,390
25% of the world's prison population.

1629
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,860
And then we start looking
at looking at the ratio,

1630
00:50:07,861 --> 00:50:11,000
sort of discrimination in
terms of who's in prison.

1631
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:15,110
Black men make up 5% of the
population or 6% of the population,

1632
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:17,510
35% of the prison population.

1633
00:50:17,511 --> 00:50:19,430
And just started to look
at all of these numbers.

1634
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,110
I think Americans are like,

1635
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,550
well we are fair,

1636
00:50:22,551 --> 00:50:24,230
we are fair people in general.

1637
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,630
And so I think they are disturbed by that.

1638
00:50:26,631 --> 00:50:27,500
I think helped.

1639
00:50:27,501 --> 00:50:28,010
And I think

1640
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,390
the fact that my book,

1641
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:29,960
uh,

1642
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:30,800
I'm a scientist,

1643
00:50:30,801 --> 00:50:32,750
I've been doing this for some years.

1644
00:50:32,751 --> 00:50:33,410
Um,

1645
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:36,560
I am on a number of boards,

1646
00:50:36,561 --> 00:50:38,540
respect at scientific boards.

1647
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:43,541
I have played the game mainstream game
and then I'm saying I've done the studies

1648
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:45,590
and I'm telling you,

1649
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:46,700
you've been misled.

1650
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,200
So that has helped.

1651
00:50:48,201 --> 00:50:49,130
My book has helped.

1652
00:50:49,131 --> 00:50:49,970
And I think that,

1653
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,460
so I think the economy,

1654
00:50:52,461 --> 00:50:54,050
the fact that um,

1655
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:54,400
the,

1656
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:54,740
uh,

1657
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,990
we don't have the kind
of money that we had,

1658
00:50:56,991 --> 00:50:57,890
we once had,

1659
00:50:57,891 --> 00:50:59,300
particularly in the mid,

1660
00:50:59,301 --> 00:51:03,800
late 1990s where we could build prisons
and we could put all this money in law

1661
00:51:03,801 --> 00:51:04,634
enforcement.

1662
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:08,750
I think all of those things have helped
people to understand that maybe we're

1663
00:51:08,751 --> 00:51:10,100
doing something wrong.

1664
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,170
And now with Colorado,

1665
00:51:12,171 --> 00:51:12,921
one of the things,

1666
00:51:12,921 --> 00:51:14,600
Colorado and Washington,

1667
00:51:14,601 --> 00:51:16,730
those two states have legalized marijuana.

1668
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:21,380
And one of the things that's being
really talked about is the amount of tax

1669
00:51:21,381 --> 00:51:26,381
revenues that the marijuana in Colorado
is going to generate in this country.

1670
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:27,411
Ultimately,

1671
00:51:27,411 --> 00:51:29,000
money remains king.

1672
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:32,000
And so that has opened people's mind.

1673
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:32,271
You know,

1674
00:51:32,271 --> 00:51:36,740
I like the think that empirical evidence
helps to really shaped the way people

1675
00:51:36,741 --> 00:51:37,460
think.

1676
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,050
But money is really king.

1677
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,240
And I think that all of
these kinds of things,

1678
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:42,200
the economy,

1679
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,310
Colorado,

1680
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,900
some information,

1681
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:47,010
the fact that we don't want to be,

1682
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:47,300
you know,

1683
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,470
moral people,

1684
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:48,891
uh,

1685
00:51:48,891 --> 00:51:52,430
all of those kinds of things are coming
together to help people to rethink to

1686
00:51:52,431 --> 00:51:53,660
what we're doing with drugs.

1687
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,120
And if you looked at our culture,

1688
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:57,200
if you will,

1689
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,470
there are civilizations scientifically
and saw those statistics,

1690
00:52:00,471 --> 00:52:05,471
those unbalanced statistics though at
the very least you would have to say,

1691
00:52:06,801 --> 00:52:06,981
well,

1692
00:52:06,981 --> 00:52:09,770
there's an incompetency in
engineering their culture.

1693
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,880
If it's not racist,

1694
00:52:10,881 --> 00:52:11,714
if it's not,

1695
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,111
if it's,

1696
00:52:12,111 --> 00:52:15,860
if they're not victimizing certain
population of a certain percentage of the

1697
00:52:15,861 --> 00:52:18,490
population that can't defend
itself as effectively and,

1698
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,610
and taking advantage of them.

1699
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,170
At the very least,

1700
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,070
it's a very poor engineering
of the civilization.

1701
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:25,121
I agree,

1702
00:52:25,121 --> 00:52:25,451
man.

1703
00:52:25,451 --> 00:52:25,751
You know,

1704
00:52:25,751 --> 00:52:26,411
the thing is,

1705
00:52:26,411 --> 00:52:29,170
is that this is one of the things
that one of the things I did,

1706
00:52:29,171 --> 00:52:31,410
I actually believed many of the Americans,

1707
00:52:31,411 --> 00:52:34,750
so to mythology that we were
a fair people that you know,

1708
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:36,220
equal rights for everyone.

1709
00:52:36,221 --> 00:52:38,800
And so I think a lot of us believe that.

1710
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:43,830
And so I think as a result of us
believing that sort of mythology and then

1711
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,970
actually looking at the data,

1712
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:47,590
I think people are disturbed.

1713
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:51,890
I think that people are
understanding that uh,

1714
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:56,470
we are just about 50 years removed from
the march on Washington and the famous

1715
00:52:56,471 --> 00:52:57,670
Martin Luther King speech,

1716
00:52:57,671 --> 00:52:58,960
I have a dream and that sort of thing.

1717
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:01,360
50 years removed from that now.

1718
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:06,570
And then we were all upset about the
social injustice that happened during that

1719
00:53:06,821 --> 00:53:07,654
era.

1720
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:12,580
Now I think people are understanding
that we have our own social injustice

1721
00:53:12,581 --> 00:53:14,350
happening right before our eyes.

1722
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:14,801
And,

1723
00:53:14,801 --> 00:53:17,200
and so the question becomes,

1724
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:18,371
well,

1725
00:53:18,371 --> 00:53:21,520
where will history say
you were on the issue?

1726
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:23,740
And I think people are getting it.

1727
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:24,590
I think I,

1728
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:25,200
but I,

1729
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,450
many people would just
simply ignorant to it.

1730
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:29,370
But I think the message
is getting out now.

1731
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:32,150
So it was just this combination
of factors that are overwhelming.

1732
00:53:32,151 --> 00:53:34,010
The Internet providing
all this information,

1733
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,090
Colorado and Washington state providing
alternatives to the economic situation.

1734
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:39,440
All of the above,

1735
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,010
all of them.

1736
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:41,030
It is an issue.

1737
00:53:41,031 --> 00:53:43,970
It's one of the big issues when it comes
to the difference between a democratic

1738
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:47,210
leader in the Republican leader is
the way they treat some sort of social

1739
00:53:47,211 --> 00:53:47,990
issues.

1740
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:50,220
And that's a big one that the,

1741
00:53:50,221 --> 00:53:53,420
the way that the Obama administration
is sort of sad that they were going to

1742
00:53:53,421 --> 00:53:56,150
treat marijuana and then
the way they did treat it,

1743
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:57,530
which is very different.

1744
00:53:57,531 --> 00:53:59,870
It was very Bush like it was,

1745
00:53:59,871 --> 00:54:01,340
it wasn't much different.

1746
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:02,443
I mean error,

1747
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:06,380
they've started recently saying that
they wouldn't go after these states,

1748
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:09,110
but there was a lot of
people that went to jail.

1749
00:54:09,111 --> 00:54:10,130
A lot of people did time.

1750
00:54:10,131 --> 00:54:13,250
A lot of people are still
involved in the court system.

1751
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,690
I know people personally that have been
busted and they were doing everything

1752
00:54:17,691 --> 00:54:19,670
according to state law fact.

1753
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:20,841
So what,

1754
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:21,674
what's that about?

1755
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:23,011
That's a good one,

1756
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:23,370
man.

1757
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:24,180
Um,

1758
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:24,871
you know,

1759
00:54:24,871 --> 00:54:29,871
I think about when Bill Clinton was
elected in 1992 and I remember the

1760
00:54:30,031 --> 00:54:33,930
excitement that the country had because
we thought that war on drugs and all

1761
00:54:33,931 --> 00:54:34,501
these things,

1762
00:54:34,501 --> 00:54:36,590
we're going to reverse them.

1763
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,820
Turns out Bill Clinton
under his administration,

1764
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:39,970
more people were arrested,

1765
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,610
any other administration for
these sorts of violations and um,

1766
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:44,901
at,

1767
00:54:44,901 --> 00:54:46,020
at until that time.

1768
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:46,291
Uh,

1769
00:54:46,291 --> 00:54:51,270
and so I think a similar thing kind of
happened under the Obama Administration.

1770
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:56,010
It's hard for the democratic sort of
leadership or the Democratic candidate or

1771
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,990
president to,

1772
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:58,860
uh,

1773
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:03,860
go in a different direction for fear of
being considered soft on drugs on crime.

1774
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:06,030
Now I will say this,

1775
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:07,650
this administration,

1776
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:08,450
um,

1777
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:09,120
uh,

1778
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:14,120
as of late is the only administration
that said that they were going to change

1779
00:55:14,401 --> 00:55:16,500
the way that the justice system,

1780
00:55:16,501 --> 00:55:17,490
for example,

1781
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,300
uh,

1782
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,030
in forced mandatory minimum drug laws,

1783
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,820
they said they wouldn't be
enforcing those laws anymore.

1784
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:24,301
They sat,

1785
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:25,134
that sort of thing.

1786
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:30,390
This administration said that they will
leave Colorado and Washington alone,

1787
00:55:30,391 --> 00:55:33,990
those states that have legalized
marijuana because under federal law,

1788
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:36,060
marijuana remains illegal.

1789
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:39,930
So technically the federal
government can come in and stop that.

1790
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:43,680
But they have said they were going to
allow it to happen and they said it's an

1791
00:55:43,681 --> 00:55:45,330
important sort of experiment.

1792
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:48,150
And so on the one hand,

1793
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,170
I'm certainly,

1794
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:49,700
I,

1795
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:53,070
I certainly wished they would do
more the current administration.

1796
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:56,610
But when we look at what previous
administrations have done,

1797
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,100
they have done more than
any other administration

1798
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:00,440
when it comes to drugs,

1799
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,273
when it comes to drugs.

1800
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:04,370
So there have been some horrible things
like the busting of these medical

1801
00:56:04,371 --> 00:56:05,420
marijuana dispensaries.

1802
00:56:05,421 --> 00:56:08,660
But is that just a part of what we were
talking about earlier that just the

1803
00:56:08,661 --> 00:56:10,340
machine needs to be fed and they,

1804
00:56:10,341 --> 00:56:13,730
it's way easier to do that then the
knock on some trailer that's got smoke

1805
00:56:13,731 --> 00:56:17,060
coming out of it in the middle of the
desert and some dude comes out when a

1806
00:56:17,061 --> 00:56:18,290
machine gun and you know,

1807
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:20,060
you go into one of
those medical marijuana,

1808
00:56:20,061 --> 00:56:21,410
you got a nice clean bust.

1809
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:21,651
Yeah,

1810
00:56:21,651 --> 00:56:22,740
bring in a lot of cash.

1811
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,310
And if people don't know the racket,

1812
00:56:24,311 --> 00:56:24,730
it's,

1813
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:25,870
it's kind of hilarious.

1814
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:26,853
Here's what they do.

1815
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:28,120
They go,

1816
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:28,870
they,

1817
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:29,860
they arrest you.

1818
00:56:29,861 --> 00:56:30,694
They come in,

1819
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,060
Jack booted with fucking bulletproof
vests on and machine guns.

1820
00:56:34,061 --> 00:56:35,020
They hold people down,

1821
00:56:35,021 --> 00:56:37,660
they step on your neck when you're
on the ground is videos of all this.

1822
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:38,620
And I'm making this up.

1823
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:44,010
They take all the weed and they take
all the money and then they say that

1824
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:47,290
they'll be in touch with you.

1825
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,530
They say that they'll review your case.

1826
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:52,240
That charges will be pending.

1827
00:56:52,241 --> 00:56:54,580
They decide when they're
going to press charges,

1828
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:56,680
when they're going to put
your thing into a system.

1829
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:59,320
So then these people have to decide
whether or not they go back to work.

1830
00:56:59,360 --> 00:56:59,620
Yeah.

1831
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:01,300
Do they decide whether or
not they go back to there?

1832
00:57:01,301 --> 00:57:02,860
No one's been charged with anything yet.

1833
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:03,791
You got arrested,

1834
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:05,230
they took all your shit
and then they let you go.

1835
00:57:05,231 --> 00:57:09,100
And so you're sitting there terrified
and broke trying to figure out is this

1836
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:10,480
worth doing more of?

1837
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,670
And the people that work there often quit.

1838
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:13,900
You've got to find new employees.

1839
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,510
College kids don't like getting
boots put to their face and you know,

1840
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:19,440
got in their back for week.

1841
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:20,080
Right.

1842
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,250
And so they,

1843
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:25,600
this money just evaporates and it's
been millions of dollars worth of money.

1844
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:27,640
It just sorta goes away.

1845
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:28,570
No,

1846
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,210
you can't get a hit.

1847
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:29,921
You can't get it back.

1848
00:57:29,921 --> 00:57:30,520
It's not yours.

1849
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,353
The weed,

1850
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:32,450
it's ours now.

1851
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:33,350
It just goes away.

1852
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:33,801
No,

1853
00:57:33,801 --> 00:57:34,101
I mean,

1854
00:57:34,101 --> 00:57:35,450
these kinds of things needed to be,

1855
00:57:35,451 --> 00:57:39,020
they need to be highlighted and people
need to really publicize these things

1856
00:57:39,021 --> 00:57:39,860
because I mean,

1857
00:57:39,861 --> 00:57:40,970
as you just described,

1858
00:57:40,971 --> 00:57:42,500
obviously most of us are,

1859
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:43,550
uh,

1860
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:45,380
horrified at those kind of events.

1861
00:57:45,381 --> 00:57:46,820
But people need to know,

1862
00:57:46,821 --> 00:57:47,091
I mean,

1863
00:57:47,091 --> 00:57:49,070
this has been going on in this country,

1864
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:49,970
um,

1865
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:51,050
for decades.

1866
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:51,581
Yeah.

1867
00:57:51,581 --> 00:57:55,770
It seems like there's gotta be
a way to balance it out too.

1868
00:57:56,130 --> 00:58:00,030
There's gotta be a way to take all of
these industries that are profiting off of

1869
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:04,860
it being illegal and locking people
up and making sure there's no law

1870
00:58:04,861 --> 00:58:07,680
enforcement officers that are being paid.

1871
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:10,080
There's gotta be a way to
shift that into something else.

1872
00:58:10,081 --> 00:58:11,010
And until they do,

1873
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:12,270
it's a hard road.

1874
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:12,921
Well,

1875
00:58:12,921 --> 00:58:13,310
you know,

1876
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:13,671
first of all,

1877
00:58:13,671 --> 00:58:14,870
we have to have the conversation,

1878
00:58:14,871 --> 00:58:15,170
dad.

1879
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:15,500
Right?

1880
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,460
It has to be a shift.

1881
00:58:16,461 --> 00:58:17,300
Like you're saying,

1882
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:19,880
people are not even
having that conversation.

1883
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:21,560
People aren't having a
conversation and say,

1884
00:58:21,561 --> 00:58:22,100
well,

1885
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:26,810
what do we do with this machine that we
built up over the separate past several

1886
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:27,170
decades?

1887
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:27,501
I mean,

1888
00:58:27,501 --> 00:58:29,810
I can think of a number
of ways that we can,

1889
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:30,980
uh,

1890
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,630
use police officers,

1891
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:33,350
uh,

1892
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:36,530
in different roles than what
they been used currently.

1893
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:37,071
I mean,

1894
00:58:37,071 --> 00:58:39,260
I can think about the
educational sort of thing,

1895
00:58:39,261 --> 00:58:40,280
but sometimes that's,

1896
00:58:40,281 --> 00:58:41,150
think about heroin.

1897
00:58:41,151 --> 00:58:45,290
People have been talking a lot about
heroin overdose deaths and those sorts of

1898
00:58:45,291 --> 00:58:45,531
things.

1899
00:58:45,531 --> 00:58:49,400
Saying the heroin is cut or lace
with some sort of other compound.

1900
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:52,010
We can use our police forces,

1901
00:58:52,011 --> 00:58:52,581
for example,

1902
00:58:52,581 --> 00:58:54,770
whenever they confiscate
something like heroin,

1903
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:58,730
why not do the chemical analysis and
make sure it's posted in those local

1904
00:58:58,731 --> 00:59:02,600
regions so people understand
what the drug actually contain.

1905
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:03,201
I mean,

1906
00:59:03,201 --> 00:59:05,780
we can have police outreach
doing this sort of thing.

1907
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:06,380
Okay,

1908
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:09,500
you want to avoid this because
this compound is dangerous.

1909
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,180
We can do those kinds of things.

1910
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:12,170
We never do.

1911
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,440
They never tell the public
what's actually in the compound.

1912
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:15,980
If,

1913
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,480
if something is in the compound,

1914
00:59:17,481 --> 00:59:18,314
they say that,

1915
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:18,531
oh,

1916
00:59:18,531 --> 00:59:22,040
it's cut with something or why not
tell the public who more likely to be

1917
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,820
susceptible to obtain in that

1918
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:24,743
type of heroin.

1919
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:25,561
Completely agree.

1920
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:26,940
But if you were on the bill O'Reilly show,

1921
00:59:26,941 --> 00:59:27,331
he'd be like,

1922
00:59:27,331 --> 00:59:30,480
you're just going to encourage those
kids now they know what they can take and

1923
00:59:30,481 --> 00:59:31,314
what not to take.

1924
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:31,651
You're going to,

1925
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:32,910
you're going to do the testing for them.

1926
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,080
Who's going to pay for that testing?

1927
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:39,000
Our tax dollars are going to go to give
them the exact recipe of their heroin

1928
00:59:39,001 --> 00:59:39,834
that they like.

1929
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,370
So Bill O'reilly,

1930
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:41,621
you know,

1931
00:59:41,621 --> 00:59:43,720
he was generous enough
to have me on his show.

1932
00:59:43,721 --> 00:59:44,381
And so,

1933
00:59:44,381 --> 00:59:44,760
um,

1934
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:45,070
uh,

1935
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:46,480
so props to him for that.

1936
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:50,500
But the thing about the bill O'Reilly
show is that people should not get

1937
00:59:50,501 --> 00:59:51,334
twisted.

1938
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:52,570
That is not news.

1939
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,620
That is entertainment.

1940
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:58,770
And the goal of what he's disseminating
is not public education and not

1941
00:59:58,871 --> 01:00:00,520
necessarily for the public good.

1942
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:01,930
So if you want to be entertained,

1943
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:02,830
he's outstanding.

1944
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,780
But if you actually want information,

1945
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:05,990
you're in the wrong place.

1946
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:06,441
Wait a minute,

1947
01:00:06,441 --> 01:00:06,621
man.

1948
01:00:06,621 --> 01:00:09,770
You didn't wash the thing about him
talking about God making the tie go in and

1949
01:00:09,771 --> 01:00:11,330
it's how I go out and
no one can explain it.

1950
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:12,620
You didn't see that.

1951
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,360
I watched that and I was like,

1952
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:14,631
okay,

1953
01:00:14,631 --> 01:00:15,650
he's fucking trolling.

1954
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:17,013
He's trolling.

1955
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,350
He knows about gravity.

1956
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,400
This is motherfuckers saying,

1957
01:00:19,401 --> 01:00:20,870
we can't explain why the tie goes in.

1958
01:00:20,871 --> 01:00:21,704
The tide goes out.

1959
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:22,341
He knows.

1960
01:00:22,341 --> 01:00:24,620
They can explain that
he's fucking with you.

1961
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:25,321
Well,

1962
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:25,651
I mean,

1963
01:00:25,651 --> 01:00:26,250
think about it.

1964
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:30,720
The guys had the number one new shell
quote unquote news in the United States

1965
01:00:30,721 --> 01:00:33,180
for about 15 1617 years.

1966
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,880
And that's the formula that is used.

1967
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:37,170
Why should he change?

1968
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:37,560
Right.

1969
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:40,350
So for him it's like he might
as well be like Stephen Colbert.

1970
01:00:40,351 --> 01:00:41,190
He's playing a role.

1971
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:41,810
Absolutely.

1972
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:43,080
Just his role's not funny.

1973
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,720
His role is just designed to
scare the shit out of you and get,

1974
01:00:45,721 --> 01:00:46,920
you want to build bigger barns.

1975
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:47,311
Well,

1976
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:51,210
the thing about it is that you and I
understand that he's playing a role and he

1977
01:00:51,211 --> 01:00:52,410
understands he's playing a role,

1978
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:54,170
but all of these networks works

1979
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:54,680
like that.

1980
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:55,940
They're all playing a role.

1981
01:00:55,941 --> 01:00:56,091
And,

1982
01:00:56,091 --> 01:00:56,421
but the,

1983
01:00:56,421 --> 01:00:59,270
the thing is we just don't
caricature them like we do him,

1984
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:00,500
but they're all playing a role.

1985
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:02,170
They bring in suits,

1986
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:03,440
so called experts,

1987
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:05,480
but they think that they're the expert.

1988
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:08,090
And so all of these
guys are playing a role.

1989
01:01:08,091 --> 01:01:08,990
It's entertainment.

1990
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,830
It's not news.

1991
01:01:09,831 --> 01:01:11,840
And that's one thing that
the public has to understand.

1992
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:12,830
That's not news.

1993
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,030
You can't,

1994
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:14,320
I mean,

1995
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,330
they give you news while they're
giving you entertainment,

1996
01:01:17,331 --> 01:01:18,500
but you're absolutely right.

1997
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:20,060
It's entertainment first.

1998
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:20,391
Yeah.

1999
01:01:20,391 --> 01:01:24,980
That's why they're wearing skirts
that barely cover their vaginas.

2000
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:25,431
I mean,

2001
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,900
those women on Fox News,

2002
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,900
those are some of the hottest
legs you could see on television.

2003
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:33,320
And they're giving you the news and
they're crossing their legs back and forth

2004
01:01:33,321 --> 01:01:35,510
when they're on the couch hypnotizing you.

2005
01:01:35,511 --> 01:01:37,040
You don't know what the
fuck they're talking about.

2006
01:01:37,041 --> 01:01:39,290
Syria or Ukraine.

2007
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:40,101
Who knows?

2008
01:01:40,101 --> 01:01:40,881
Look at her legs.

2009
01:01:40,881 --> 01:01:41,714
Why is her,

2010
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:42,890
her legs are naked.

2011
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:46,760
Like imagine if guys wore
skirts and interviews will
be the most ridiculous shit

2012
01:01:46,761 --> 01:01:47,270
ever.

2013
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:48,230
But somehow or another,

2014
01:01:48,231 --> 01:01:50,120
you're allowed to see
most of this woman's,

2015
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:51,650
you know,

2016
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:51,801
you,

2017
01:01:51,801 --> 01:01:53,210
she is actually attractive legs.

2018
01:01:53,211 --> 01:01:56,150
You should actually go to the
network and tell them that,

2019
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:58,010
or Beto nicely go and I,

2020
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:00,350
I get tongue tied.

2021
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:01,640
It wouldn't be able to talk.

2022
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:02,481
Yeah,

2023
01:02:02,481 --> 01:02:02,661
it's,

2024
01:02:02,661 --> 01:02:03,441
it's hilarious.

2025
01:02:03,441 --> 01:02:03,861
I mean it's,

2026
01:02:03,861 --> 01:02:04,510
it's a,

2027
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:05,810
it's a propaganda factory.

2028
01:02:05,811 --> 01:02:06,471
I mean it really is.

2029
01:02:06,471 --> 01:02:06,601
I mean,

2030
01:02:06,601 --> 01:02:10,340
it just trying to try to dance for you
and get you to keep tuning in so they

2031
01:02:10,341 --> 01:02:11,480
could sell shampoo.

2032
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:12,231
I mean,

2033
01:02:12,231 --> 01:02:13,610
all I know exactly,

2034
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:15,440
but that's all we have.

2035
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:15,801
I mean,

2036
01:02:15,801 --> 01:02:16,101
if it's,

2037
01:02:16,101 --> 01:02:18,710
if you don't go out and
get your news on your own,

2038
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:22,070
if you're one of those people that you
get home from work and you turn a car and

2039
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,260
you turn on the evening news and you
sit in front of the dinner table and you

2040
01:02:25,261 --> 01:02:26,100
watch the evening news,

2041
01:02:26,101 --> 01:02:28,080
if that's the only way
you get your information,

2042
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,370
like wow,

2043
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,353
we're fucked.

2044
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:31,830
Yeah,

2045
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:32,371
that's right.

2046
01:02:32,371 --> 01:02:33,930
That's why I'm a college professor.

2047
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:36,023
To help.

2048
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:36,481
Yeah.

2049
01:02:36,481 --> 01:02:36,870
I mean,

2050
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:37,561
I guess it,

2051
01:02:37,561 --> 01:02:39,540
but that is the future.

2052
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:43,170
Like guys like you teaching young
people so that they grow up in a day.

2053
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:43,411
I mean,

2054
01:02:43,411 --> 01:02:45,210
I think they're growing up
in a different environment.

2055
01:02:45,211 --> 01:02:47,190
Anyone doesn't think
we're in a new moment man,

2056
01:02:47,191 --> 01:02:50,100
particularly as it comes
as it relates to the drugs.

2057
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:53,580
This is something that we haven't seen
before and the young people today,

2058
01:02:53,581 --> 01:02:54,900
I mean you see it on Twitter,

2059
01:02:54,901 --> 01:02:55,980
I see it on Twitter.

2060
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:58,980
Some of the comments and
statements that people tweet at me,

2061
01:02:58,981 --> 01:03:02,490
I mean they are a lot more critical
about this issue with that my generation

2062
01:03:02,491 --> 01:03:02,791
was,

2063
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:07,230
and so I am deeply encouraged and
so when I speak on this issue,

2064
01:03:07,231 --> 01:03:08,100
as you pointed out,

2065
01:03:08,101 --> 01:03:10,950
how frustrating it might be
to deal with certain people.

2066
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:13,260
I'm not really dealing with those people.

2067
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:15,090
I'm really dealing with the future.

2068
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:19,170
I'm speaking for history and that's
really the only way you can change things.

2069
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:21,570
Just to change the minds of the
young people that are coming up.

2070
01:03:21,571 --> 01:03:22,950
The people that are set in their ways,

2071
01:03:22,951 --> 01:03:26,340
they already have their mortgages
that they have to protect and that's,

2072
01:03:26,341 --> 01:03:26,700
yeah,

2073
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:30,990
they can also justify that it's okay
what they're doing because they've always

2074
01:03:30,991 --> 01:03:31,380
done it.

2075
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,510
Other people are doing it and it's legal.

2076
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:34,290
That's right.

2077
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:35,910
So they don't think
they're doing any wrong.

2078
01:03:35,911 --> 01:03:37,830
I had a friend who was a
cop I did Jujitsu with.

2079
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:38,521
He was always telling me,

2080
01:03:38,521 --> 01:03:38,701
hey,

2081
01:03:38,701 --> 01:03:39,570
if I don't give a fuck,

2082
01:03:39,571 --> 01:03:41,010
if they've got a medical
marijuana license,

2083
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:42,530
catch him with weed on busing them.

2084
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,291
And I'm like,

2085
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:43,580
dude,

2086
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:44,730
you fucking listen to yourself.

2087
01:03:44,731 --> 01:03:45,391
You're a good guy.

2088
01:03:45,391 --> 01:03:46,410
Like why are you talking like that?

2089
01:03:46,411 --> 01:03:47,250
That's ridiculous.

2090
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:48,240
You would take me,

2091
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:48,900
aren't we friends?

2092
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:49,381
You'd take me in,

2093
01:03:49,381 --> 01:03:50,610
you throw me in jail for no reason.

2094
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:51,271
Just stupid.

2095
01:03:51,271 --> 01:03:52,260
That is what,

2096
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:53,071
but your friend,

2097
01:03:53,071 --> 01:03:53,251
right?

2098
01:03:53,251 --> 01:03:54,300
You talking to your friend?

2099
01:03:54,301 --> 01:03:55,500
I'm sure he respects you.

2100
01:03:55,501 --> 01:03:58,140
So therefore he probably
reevaluate what he just said.

2101
01:03:58,170 --> 01:03:59,003
I hope so.

2102
01:03:59,040 --> 01:03:59,910
I don't think so though.

2103
01:03:59,911 --> 01:04:01,140
He's fucking crazy that dude.

2104
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:02,700
But he's a cop and you know,

2105
01:04:02,701 --> 01:04:02,991
he,

2106
01:04:02,991 --> 01:04:03,660
he just,

2107
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:05,760
he thinks of it as us versus them.

2108
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:06,241
You know,

2109
01:04:06,241 --> 01:04:10,800
he's got that mentality of us versus
them and that when there's a law,

2110
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:12,870
it allows that other person to be to them.

2111
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:13,500
That's right.

2112
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,550
If it's written down,

2113
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:14,761
oh,

2114
01:04:14,761 --> 01:04:15,480
that's a them.

2115
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:15,990
That's right.

2116
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:16,141
I mean,

2117
01:04:16,141 --> 01:04:16,974
that also does,

2118
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:20,490
I mean that's one of the things that
happens when people are involved in legal

2119
01:04:20,491 --> 01:04:21,181
cases,

2120
01:04:21,181 --> 01:04:22,440
divorces,

2121
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:22,860
you know,

2122
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:23,790
disputes with their company.

2123
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:24,660
It's us and them.

2124
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:26,640
And we go into US versus them mode.

2125
01:04:26,970 --> 01:04:29,520
And cops are an US versus them
mode when it comes to drugs.

2126
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:34,020
They've lived their whole lives as
police officers under the thinking that

2127
01:04:34,021 --> 01:04:38,010
someone who's got drugs is a perp
and then they can get that guy.

2128
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,080
And then that's something that they win.

2129
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:40,480
They win,

2130
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,610
the guy's in jail and they win.

2131
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:41,941
That's right.

2132
01:04:41,941 --> 01:04:43,860
They dehumanize the person and so forth.

2133
01:04:43,861 --> 01:04:45,450
And that person isn't really a person.

2134
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:46,740
And that's a problem.

2135
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,940
That's a major problem.

2136
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:48,511
I mean,

2137
01:04:48,511 --> 01:04:48,641
and,

2138
01:04:48,641 --> 01:04:50,880
and so you want to make sure that people,

2139
01:04:50,881 --> 01:04:52,710
we want to encourage people
not to behave like that.

2140
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:53,311
Yeah.

2141
01:04:53,311 --> 01:04:56,340
And it's gotta be really
hard for the cops as well,

2142
01:04:56,341 --> 01:04:59,220
if this is what they've done
always their entire career.

2143
01:04:59,221 --> 01:05:01,950
And then all of a sudden the laws
change and they have to adjust.

2144
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:02,491
Well,

2145
01:05:02,491 --> 01:05:03,720
so I was in the military,

2146
01:05:03,721 --> 01:05:03,931
you know,

2147
01:05:03,931 --> 01:05:04,920
we haven't talked about that.

2148
01:05:04,921 --> 01:05:08,610
And so I was a cop in the military
for a short period of times.

2149
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:11,570
And one of the things
about cops that they're,

2150
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,570
they're really good at,

2151
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:17,650
they're really good at taking orders so
they will adjust if it comes from the

2152
01:05:17,651 --> 01:05:18,370
top,

2153
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:18,971
but it has,

2154
01:05:18,971 --> 01:05:23,770
the pressure has to be put on the top
to make sure that the sort of rank and

2155
01:05:23,771 --> 01:05:28,000
file officers followed
followed the these orders.

2156
01:05:28,001 --> 01:05:28,391
But they,

2157
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:28,581
they,

2158
01:05:28,581 --> 01:05:30,100
they're really good at following orders.

2159
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:31,830
They I,

2160
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:32,221
I'm,

2161
01:05:32,221 --> 01:05:33,070
I'm sure they are.

2162
01:05:33,071 --> 01:05:36,490
I just would be concerned that it would
take a long time to turn that battleship

2163
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:37,300
of,

2164
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:40,360
of intent around change
the way they look at it.

2165
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:41,500
Look at Colorado,

2166
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,393
look at Washington,

2167
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:43,683
right?

2168
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:47,680
The amount of money that those folks
are projected to make in terms of

2169
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:48,550
taxpayer's money.

2170
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:54,600
I assure you you're going to have former
d a e agents involved in the marijuana

2171
01:05:54,911 --> 01:05:55,744
industry,

2172
01:05:56,290 --> 01:06:00,070
police officers involved in that
industry relative relatively quickly.

2173
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:01,990
So when you say it's
going to take a long time,

2174
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:02,490
no,

2175
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:03,640
it won't take a long time.

2176
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:08,670
All you have to do is just change to
change the orders or to continue to see,

2177
01:06:09,141 --> 01:06:09,810
to continue to,

2178
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:10,480
in this case,

2179
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,650
money so you can actually do it if
you have a commitment to doing it.

2180
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:15,340
I,

2181
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:16,690
I don't think it'll take a long term.

2182
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,070
That's very optimistic.

2183
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:20,920
When you look at Colorado and
you look at Washington state,

2184
01:06:20,921 --> 01:06:23,500
do you think that the genie's out of the
bottle and it's just going to spread?

2185
01:06:23,501 --> 01:06:28,501
Now the genie is out of the bottle and
it will depend whether the genie stays

2186
01:06:30,641 --> 01:06:31,361
out of the bottle.

2187
01:06:31,361 --> 01:06:35,440
Depends on how much tax
revenue is generated.

2188
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:36,610
That's number one.

2189
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:41,890
If Colorado continues to generate the
revenue that they've been reporting

2190
01:06:41,891 --> 01:06:42,724
recently,

2191
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,040
the genie's out of the bottle for a while.

2192
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:46,450
Especially in this economy.

2193
01:06:46,451 --> 01:06:47,500
It's kind of a perfect storm,

2194
01:06:47,501 --> 01:06:48,100
right?

2195
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,220
This screwed up economy when
everything's all that's right,

2196
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:52,750
especially in this accounting me,

2197
01:06:52,751 --> 01:06:54,130
but in the United States,

2198
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:55,690
if you're making money,

2199
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,890
that trumps everything,

2200
01:06:57,070 --> 01:06:57,903
right?

2201
01:06:58,270 --> 01:06:58,990
Hold on.

2202
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:00,610
Freak fucking group of humans.

2203
01:07:00,611 --> 01:07:01,444
We are.

2204
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:03,850
It's really strange,

2205
01:07:03,851 --> 01:07:05,470
but it's exciting.

2206
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:05,771
I mean,

2207
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:08,260
I hate the fact that the
situation exists as it is.

2208
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:12,070
I hate the fact that a g just as giant
percentage of our population is in prison

2209
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:15,640
for nonviolent crimes and
involve personal choice and drug,

2210
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:17,740
either drug use or even selling drugs.

2211
01:07:17,741 --> 01:07:17,981
It's,

2212
01:07:17,981 --> 01:07:21,370
it's unbelievably hypocritical when
you have drugs everywhere you look.

2213
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:22,204
But,

2214
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:26,530
but at least I'm encouraged that I
see this shift in the young people.

2215
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:26,681
Yeah,

2216
01:07:26,681 --> 01:07:27,191
me too.

2217
01:07:27,191 --> 01:07:30,420
I'm very encouraged men and that's
the thing that keeps me going.

2218
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:33,130
That's the thing that keeps
me on the road with this book,

2219
01:07:33,131 --> 01:07:35,950
talking to people about this
issue of trying to educate people.

2220
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:36,371
I mean,

2221
01:07:36,371 --> 01:07:36,670
um,

2222
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:39,970
because I think that they're going
to do it better than we did it.

2223
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
And if I could play any role
in helping them do it better,

2224
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:44,283
let's do it.

2225
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:49,300
What's been the biggest resistance that
have all these years of studying drugs

2226
01:07:49,301 --> 01:07:51,250
and studying the reactions of drugs?

2227
01:07:51,251 --> 01:07:51,551
What do you,

2228
01:07:51,551 --> 01:07:54,820
what do you feel has been the biggest
resistance of their biggest hurdle that

2229
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:55,810
you've had to overcome?

2230
01:07:55,811 --> 01:07:59,590
Because I'm sure it must have been
pretty difficult to get this going,

2231
01:07:59,591 --> 01:08:00,640
especially in the 90s.

2232
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:01,571
Yeah,

2233
01:08:01,571 --> 01:08:01,870
I,

2234
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:02,681
you know,

2235
01:08:02,681 --> 01:08:05,590
so when you say what's been
the biggest hurdle to overcome?

2236
01:08:05,591 --> 01:08:08,140
I'm not sure if you mean
professional hurt holder hurdle,

2237
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:09,310
a personal hurdle.

2238
01:08:09,311 --> 01:08:10,130
Because you know,

2239
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:14,980
in the book it's personal and professional
and so it all kind of binds it all.

2240
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,280
I'm not sure exactly

2241
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:17,930
where you want to go with this.

2242
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,070
Well either one either or.

2243
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:21,890
But I what I meant is the
resistance to your research.

2244
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:22,351
Yeah.

2245
01:08:22,351 --> 01:08:23,910
So the resistance that a research,

2246
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:24,270
uh,

2247
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:29,270
the biggest sort of resistance has been
primarily from law enforcement community

2248
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:34,740
and treatment providers that those types
of dose to communities in part because,

2249
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:35,993
um,

2250
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,350
I mean I understand that I'm messing
with their money at some level.

2251
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:41,513
Um,

2252
01:08:41,730 --> 01:08:42,660
but that's okay.

2253
01:08:42,661 --> 01:08:44,160
I expected that sort of thing.

2254
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:49,190
And my major thing is that if I can
just get people to focus on evidence,

2255
01:08:49,701 --> 01:08:52,380
the real evidence and not the hysteria,

2256
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:55,320
not anecdotes I'll don't
anecdotes on can be important.

2257
01:08:55,650 --> 01:08:57,810
If I can get people to focus on evidence,

2258
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,520
I think I win them over.

2259
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:00,471
Yeah.

2260
01:09:00,471 --> 01:09:00,740
I,

2261
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:04,130
when I tell people how marijuana
was initially made illegal,

2262
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:04,631
they,

2263
01:09:04,631 --> 01:09:04,870
they,

2264
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:06,380
they look at me like I'm crazy.

2265
01:09:06,381 --> 01:09:09,470
Like I'm making things up and I give him
the William Randolph Hearst story and

2266
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:10,071
how they,

2267
01:09:10,071 --> 01:09:10,480
uh,

2268
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:14,210
use this term marijuana that
was a wild Mexican tobacco.

2269
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:15,270
Like it wasn't,

2270
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:19,280
and that the people that were making
marijuana illegal didn't even know they

2271
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:20,540
were making hemp illegal.

2272
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:21,290
That's right.

2273
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:23,390
Which had been used
for thousands of years.

2274
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:24,140
That's right.

2275
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:27,560
There was a product called
the decorticator that
was invented and when the

2276
01:09:27,561 --> 01:09:28,970
decorticator was invented,

2277
01:09:28,971 --> 01:09:31,550
it was a more effective way
to process the hemp fiber.

2278
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,520
And they were talking about hemp
being a billion dollar crop.

2279
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:36,260
It was on the cover of popular science.

2280
01:09:36,261 --> 01:09:37,041
And everybody was like,

2281
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:37,874
well this is it.

2282
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:38,270
You know,

2283
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:41,180
ever hemp is going to make a new combat
cause now there's a machine that allows

2284
01:09:41,181 --> 01:09:45,740
people to process it easy and
they shut that shit down so quick.

2285
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,030
And that was the original
reason why marijuana,

2286
01:09:48,031 --> 01:09:48,651
it was illegal.

2287
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:51,380
It had nothing to do with even
a psychoactive form of it.

2288
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:51,881
Well,

2289
01:09:51,881 --> 01:09:53,500
you just kind of talked about my book.

2290
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:54,363
You know,

2291
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:58,390
that's the sort of theme of the book
is that when we talk about these drugs,

2292
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:00,730
when we look from marijuana to heroin,

2293
01:10:00,731 --> 01:10:05,731
what we find is that the elect a legal
legality of these drugs have less to do

2294
01:10:05,891 --> 01:10:10,240
with the pharmacology and more to do with
these social and economic reasons that

2295
01:10:10,241 --> 01:10:11,170
you just laid out.

2296
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,220
That's precisely it.

2297
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:15,510
What's really interesting that
there are laws in two states,

2298
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:18,390
Colorado and Washington
making marijuana legal.

2299
01:10:18,391 --> 01:10:23,391
But even though hamp has
been non psychoactive and
used in this country legally

2300
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:25,013
since,

2301
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:25,620
I mean,

2302
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:28,830
you could buy it from Canada like we do
with at [inaudible] and when you bring

2303
01:10:28,831 --> 01:10:30,780
it over and it's totally legal to possess,

2304
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,100
but you can't grow it,

2305
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:32,730
right.

2306
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:34,170
They won't let you grow it.

2307
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:34,531
Right.

2308
01:10:34,531 --> 01:10:36,180
Which is just unbelievable.

2309
01:10:36,181 --> 01:10:36,301
It's,

2310
01:10:36,301 --> 01:10:41,301
it's kind of hilarious and that's the
real reason why marijuana is still illegal

2311
01:10:41,911 --> 01:10:42,451
to this day.

2312
01:10:42,451 --> 01:10:44,820
It was all done just to keep hemp out,

2313
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:45,930
which is incredible.

2314
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:46,951
Yeah.

2315
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:47,401
So,

2316
01:10:47,401 --> 01:10:47,850
um,

2317
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:48,421
there were,

2318
01:10:48,421 --> 01:10:48,960
um,

2319
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,650
and also one of the things that we
have to understand too is that there is

2320
01:10:52,651 --> 01:10:54,700
always this sort of a,

2321
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:57,600
the time when we made marijuana illegal,

2322
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:58,553
um,

2323
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:03,150
it was a time when the country didn't
really want to have federal laws and so

2324
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:06,420
you had to have a fuel.

2325
01:11:06,421 --> 01:11:11,140
And the fuel that we use was related to
the Mexicans and black people using the

2326
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:11,461
drug.

2327
01:11:11,461 --> 01:11:13,470
So there were a number
of people who genuinely,

2328
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,340
genuinely

2329
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:19,340
believe that marijuana made these
folks misbehave and engage in a heinous

2330
01:11:20,761 --> 01:11:21,451
crimes.

2331
01:11:21,451 --> 01:11:26,150
And so people thought that
the drug was so awful that we,

2332
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:26,910
we would,

2333
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:29,880
that any responsible
society would ban the drug.

2334
01:11:29,881 --> 01:11:31,920
So that component of,

2335
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:32,181
of,

2336
01:11:32,181 --> 01:11:32,451
of,

2337
01:11:32,451 --> 01:11:35,910
of banning drugs existed before marijuana.

2338
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:37,980
That's why heroin opioids,

2339
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:39,390
opiates were bad.

2340
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,520
That's why cocaine was banned earlier.

2341
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:42,661
So,

2342
01:11:42,661 --> 01:11:43,200
um,

2343
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:43,561
yeah,

2344
01:11:43,561 --> 01:11:43,891
this,

2345
01:11:43,891 --> 01:11:45,330
this year I'm just,

2346
01:11:45,331 --> 01:11:47,490
song has been played over and over.

2347
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:48,453
Um,

2348
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,880
who financed the reefer madness?

2349
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,193
Do you know,

2350
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:53,243
um,

2351
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:54,990
who financed reefer madness?

2352
01:11:54,991 --> 01:11:59,010
That's a tough question because I don't
know all of the history related to it.

2353
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:04,370
One of the things that I do know is that
the bureau of narcotics headed up at

2354
01:12:04,951 --> 01:12:07,470
the time by Harry Anslinger.

2355
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:12,830
His bureau got more money as a result
of going at the marijuana or vilify

2356
01:12:13,171 --> 01:12:14,004
marijuana.

2357
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:17,220
And so I know that
played a big role in the,

2358
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:17,581
the,

2359
01:12:17,581 --> 01:12:18,140
the,

2360
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:18,570
um,

2361
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:19,500
driving of,

2362
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:19,810
of,

2363
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:21,600
of making marijuana illegal.

2364
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,000
But in terms of the Hearst family,

2365
01:12:24,001 --> 01:12:25,680
that whole story line,

2366
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:27,480
I know it slightly,

2367
01:12:27,481 --> 01:12:30,720
but I don't know it as well as I
know the Harry Anslinger story.

2368
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:35,190
If it was apparently it was originally
financed by a church group under the

2369
01:12:35,191 --> 01:12:36,630
title tell your children.

2370
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:37,441
And,

2371
01:12:37,441 --> 01:12:37,530
uh,

2372
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:41,220
the film was intended to be shown to
parents as a morality tale attempting to

2373
01:12:41,221 --> 01:12:42,570
teach them this from Wikipedia,

2374
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,910
teach them about the
dangers of cannabis use.

2375
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:45,571
However,

2376
01:12:45,571 --> 01:12:46,980
soon after the film was shot,

2377
01:12:46,981 --> 01:12:49,530
it was purchased by producer Duane Asper,

2378
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:54,210
who recut the film for distribution
on the exploitation exploitation film

2379
01:12:54,211 --> 01:12:56,310
circuit beginning in 38,

2380
01:12:56,370 --> 01:12:57,360
1939.

2381
01:12:57,361 --> 01:12:58,890
And through the forties and fifties,

2382
01:12:58,891 --> 01:13:03,180
the film was rediscovered in the early
seventies and gain new life as a satire

2383
01:13:03,181 --> 01:13:06,010
among advocates of cannabis policy reform.

2384
01:13:06,011 --> 01:13:06,844
So again,

2385
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:08,280
it became about money.

2386
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:11,550
It the camera guy who realized he could
make some money scaring the shit out of

2387
01:13:11,551 --> 01:13:13,470
people and sell tickets to this movie.

2388
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:13,861
Yeah.

2389
01:13:13,861 --> 01:13:18,861
But also understand now by this time
when the film really became big 38.

2390
01:13:18,901 --> 01:13:22,890
So the drug was already illegal
to drug became illegal and 37.

2391
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,121
And so,

2392
01:13:24,121 --> 01:13:24,450
uh,

2393
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:28,290
maybe the film was just capitalizing
on the sort of mood at the time,

2394
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:30,830
two of the country that
people were scared.

2395
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:31,951
It's a,

2396
01:13:31,951 --> 01:13:32,910
that's kind of interesting though,

2397
01:13:32,911 --> 01:13:36,360
that it was originally from a church
group and then some dude who made money

2398
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:38,940
exploiting these fears.

2399
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:39,960
Then he started doing,

2400
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:40,111
it's,

2401
01:13:40,111 --> 01:13:43,050
it's really kind of goes along with
what we've been saying the whole time.

2402
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,160
It's all about the money.

2403
01:13:44,161 --> 01:13:44,994
Follow the money,

2404
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:45,900
follow the money.

2405
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:46,241
I mean,

2406
01:13:46,241 --> 01:13:48,210
in many of these cases follow the money.

2407
01:13:48,211 --> 01:13:50,790
It's like we all have a
price followed the money.

2408
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:52,470
That's so disturbing though.

2409
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:57,360
That's disturbing to hear for some people
that it's all our entire societies be

2410
01:13:57,361 --> 01:13:58,470
engineered by money.

2411
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,000
Well,

2412
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:00,510
um,

2413
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:01,110
you know,

2414
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:01,301
it,

2415
01:14:01,301 --> 01:14:05,340
it's one of these things that you
hope people behave in a moral fashion.

2416
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:05,761
You know,

2417
01:14:05,761 --> 01:14:09,090
despite the fact that we
have these sort of interest,

2418
01:14:09,091 --> 01:14:10,230
these monetary interest,

2419
01:14:10,231 --> 01:14:10,930
but,

2420
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:11,320
uh,

2421
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,430
if people are hearing

2422
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:15,940
for the first time that it's
about the money and well,

2423
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:17,130
they are kind of lazy

2424
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,040
to the Games,

2425
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:19,750
so yeah,

2426
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,820
it's sort of a Duh Duh.

2427
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:23,140
What do you think about,

2428
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:23,710
um,

2429
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:26,170
I don't know if you've ever
watched the a vanguard show,

2430
01:14:26,171 --> 01:14:26,471
uh,

2431
01:14:26,471 --> 01:14:27,770
the oxycontin express.

2432
01:14:27,771 --> 01:14:28,900
Did you ever see that episode?

2433
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:29,971
No.

2434
01:14:29,971 --> 01:14:30,361
How about you?

2435
01:14:30,361 --> 01:14:30,991
Tell me about it.

2436
01:14:30,991 --> 01:14:32,650
I got a lot to say about oxycon please.

2437
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:34,430
I tell me about notice show,

2438
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:35,861
great show,

2439
01:14:35,861 --> 01:14:36,580
um,

2440
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:37,810
about the,

2441
01:14:37,811 --> 01:14:38,410
uh,

2442
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:39,220
pathway,

2443
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:44,220
the highways between Florida and the
rest of the country that Florida is drug

2444
01:14:44,471 --> 01:14:45,850
use in the oxycontin.

2445
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,290
Prescriptions were so high.

2446
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:50,350
I think Florida had some insane amount,

2447
01:14:50,351 --> 01:14:55,351
like more than the entire comp country
combined by a long shot of oxycontin

2448
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:59,380
prescriptions and people were going down
to these pain management centers and

2449
01:14:59,381 --> 01:15:00,820
they documented the whole process.

2450
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:02,180
Apparently Florida,

2451
01:15:02,181 --> 01:15:05,860
since this documentary has been forced
to clean their act up because we talked

2452
01:15:05,861 --> 01:15:09,250
about it on the podcast and I got a
lot of tweets from people with new

2453
01:15:09,251 --> 01:15:10,001
information.

2454
01:15:10,001 --> 01:15:10,834
It was pretty cool.

2455
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,960
But they had these pain management
centers that were built in,

2456
01:15:13,961 --> 01:15:16,960
they have a doctor and a pharmacy
right there and my back hurts.

2457
01:15:16,961 --> 01:15:17,794
Here you go,

2458
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:18,491
take this paper,

2459
01:15:18,491 --> 01:15:19,720
go right next door and get your heroin.

2460
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:22,810
And then people would do it
under like 15 different names.

2461
01:15:22,990 --> 01:15:24,250
They had no database.

2462
01:15:24,251 --> 01:15:27,970
So you'd go to one doctor
and get a prescription and
you go down the street and

2463
01:15:27,971 --> 01:15:31,390
go to another doctor and they weren't
able to exchange information and find out

2464
01:15:31,391 --> 01:15:34,810
that this guy is Joe Rogan character has
a hundred different prescriptions for

2465
01:15:34,811 --> 01:15:37,870
oxycontin and he's just driving
around all day with a backache,

2466
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:38,650
you know?

2467
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:38,920
No,

2468
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:39,250
no.

2469
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:40,083
You know,

2470
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:42,190
like that sort of thing.

2471
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:42,830
Um,

2472
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:43,050
I'm,

2473
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:47,380
I'm happy that people are concerned
about the over use of any drug,

2474
01:15:47,381 --> 01:15:48,214
for example.

2475
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:51,430
But the thing that concerns
me about the whole,

2476
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:54,640
that sort of thing is that when
you make these documentaries,

2477
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:54,890
they,

2478
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:56,710
they invariably,

2479
01:15:56,711 --> 01:15:57,880
they do poor jobs.

2480
01:15:58,150 --> 01:16:01,900
One of the reasons that they do
poor jobs is because they highlight,

2481
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:05,740
do you sort of aberrations
to the worst case scenario?

2482
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,390
And then so me,

2483
01:16:07,391 --> 01:16:08,051
the viewer,

2484
01:16:08,051 --> 01:16:13,000
or we get outraged because we see this
abhorrent behavior that's going on.

2485
01:16:13,450 --> 01:16:18,340
And then what happens is that you get
this cracked down so severe that people

2486
01:16:18,341 --> 01:16:19,360
who are in pain,

2487
01:16:19,361 --> 01:16:22,960
who actually need the medication find
it difficult to get the medication.

2488
01:16:23,230 --> 01:16:28,230
So it'd be nice if we just had like
our routine sort of policing of the,

2489
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:33,340
all of these activities when we find
that people are abusing the system we do

2490
01:16:33,341 --> 01:16:33,611
with it,

2491
01:16:33,611 --> 01:16:34,810
but not get x,

2492
01:16:34,811 --> 01:16:35,141
don't,

2493
01:16:35,141 --> 01:16:39,850
don't exaggerate our sort of punishment
to the extent that we're doing more

2494
01:16:39,851 --> 01:16:40,660
harm.

2495
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:43,210
So on the one hand folks,

2496
01:16:43,211 --> 01:16:45,250
if they are using Oxycontin,

2497
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:50,310
I would much prefer them use oxycontin
then that they use street heroin in part

2498
01:16:50,471 --> 01:16:51,880
because Oxycontin,

2499
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:56,080
we know it's 100% pharmaceutical
grade and the adulterants,

2500
01:16:56,081 --> 01:17:00,070
there are no adulterants in that
oxycontin versus heroin where there are

2501
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:02,350
adulterants in the street level heroin.

2502
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:06,790
So on the one hand you have to think about
we have to wait all of these sorts of

2503
01:17:06,791 --> 01:17:10,250
potential risks and
benefits and oftentimes

2504
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:13,940
it's a one sided story
and that that bothers me.

2505
01:17:14,370 --> 01:17:14,550
Well,

2506
01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:17,960
one of the things they were talking about
in the documentary was how Florida was

2507
01:17:17,961 --> 01:17:19,880
providing the rest of the country for,

2508
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:20,750
with Oxycontin.

2509
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:21,980
And that's why it was a big issue.

2510
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:22,431
Sure.

2511
01:17:22,431 --> 01:17:22,570
I,

2512
01:17:22,570 --> 01:17:22,970
I'd like,

2513
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:23,511
like I said,

2514
01:17:23,511 --> 01:17:26,430
I know that Florida had
these issues and that's,

2515
01:17:26,431 --> 01:17:26,991
that's fine.

2516
01:17:26,991 --> 01:17:27,201
And the,

2517
01:17:27,201 --> 01:17:28,760
and the authorities
should take care of it.

2518
01:17:28,761 --> 01:17:30,020
They should do what's appropriate.

2519
01:17:30,021 --> 01:17:30,710
But,

2520
01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:31,041
uh,

2521
01:17:31,041 --> 01:17:34,970
I hope they don't exaggerate it
because typically that's what we do.

2522
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,190
We go overboard.

2523
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:36,601
Yeah.

2524
01:17:36,601 --> 01:17:38,250
That is one of the issues of a,

2525
01:17:38,251 --> 01:17:40,830
another article that I was
reading on Bloomberg about these,

2526
01:17:40,831 --> 01:17:41,040
uh,

2527
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:45,540
pain victims that were trapped in this
prescription crackdown and that the

2528
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:49,050
amount of oxycontin prescriptions
has dropped dramatically,

2529
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:54,380
dropped by 97% after a joint US state
task force made 2,150 arrest for offenses

2530
01:17:56,821 --> 01:18:00,570
ranging from improper sales to
overprescription by doctors.

2531
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:01,141
Yeah.

2532
01:18:01,141 --> 01:18:02,180
Docs are afraid.

2533
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:02,691
You know,

2534
01:18:02,691 --> 01:18:02,961
I mean,

2535
01:18:02,961 --> 01:18:06,890
th th th there are far more good
doctors out there who are trying to be

2536
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:07,611
responsible.

2537
01:18:07,611 --> 01:18:10,630
Then the way were ones that you described.

2538
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:11,081
Uh,

2539
01:18:11,081 --> 01:18:13,220
and the ones who are
trying to be responsible,

2540
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:14,000
they'd say,

2541
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,990
I'm not prescribing these pain meds
because I know there's potential for too

2542
01:18:17,991 --> 01:18:20,030
much potential for risk or harm.

2543
01:18:20,031 --> 01:18:20,550
Their,

2544
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:20,930
uh,

2545
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:22,670
not so much from for the patient,

2546
01:18:22,671 --> 01:18:25,190
but for myself in terms
of losing my license,

2547
01:18:25,191 --> 01:18:30,191
somebody may think that I'm doing this
intentionally and so I worry about that,

2548
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:30,920
uh,

2549
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:31,521
how we,

2550
01:18:31,521 --> 01:18:31,700
uh,

2551
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,290
crack down to severely.

2552
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:34,031
Yeah.

2553
01:18:34,031 --> 01:18:34,300
This,

2554
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:34,970
that's a,

2555
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:35,381
the,

2556
01:18:35,381 --> 01:18:40,381
the whole point of this one article on
Bloomberg and if anybody wants to check

2557
01:18:40,541 --> 01:18:40,811
it out,

2558
01:18:40,811 --> 01:18:41,590
that's the name of it.

2559
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:44,870
A Florida pain victims trap
by prescription crackdown.

2560
01:18:44,890 --> 01:18:45,391
It's under there.

2561
01:18:45,391 --> 01:18:47,770
A health section in 2010,

2562
01:18:47,771 --> 01:18:52,600
Florida had 90 of the nation's top
100 pharmacies buying oxycodone.

2563
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:55,083
Wow.

2564
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:58,450
Isn't that where a rush
Limbaugh was getting his,

2565
01:18:58,490 --> 01:18:59,080
yeah,

2566
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,270
he was popping some insane number two,

2567
01:19:01,271 --> 01:19:02,051
that fat fuck,

2568
01:19:02,051 --> 01:19:06,210
he was throwing down like a hundred a day
where you got a lot of bulks thrown a,

2569
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:07,121
you know,

2570
01:19:07,121 --> 01:19:07,960
and heroin through,

2571
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:08,381
you know,

2572
01:19:08,381 --> 01:19:10,320
on the one hand it's like it's um,

2573
01:19:10,990 --> 01:19:11,571
there is,

2574
01:19:11,571 --> 01:19:12,404
there's so much.

2575
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:13,700
They're number one,

2576
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:16,400
he was on essentially heroin.

2577
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,590
That's what Oxycontin is basically.

2578
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:20,780
But yet he was going to work,

2579
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:24,140
he was paying his taxes and he was
hand in Lizard responsibilities,

2580
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:24,650
right?

2581
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:25,483
Yeah.

2582
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:26,720
Nobody was,

2583
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:28,250
nobody pointed this out.

2584
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,470
And so when we think about drug users,

2585
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:30,990
that's your

2586
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:32,100
typical drug user.

2587
01:19:32,130 --> 01:19:32,700
Yeah,

2588
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,620
that's a great example
of it because I mean,

2589
01:19:34,621 --> 01:19:36,810
who better a guy who's anti-drugs,

2590
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:39,940
who happened to be on
drugs and a guy who's a,

2591
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:42,000
a mouthpiece for the right wing machine,

2592
01:19:42,001 --> 01:19:45,150
which has always been
anti quote unquote drugs.

2593
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:50,390
And here's a guy who's taken
fucking elephant size doses
of this shit every day.

2594
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:54,450
He's got his nanny out there
running around or whoever it was,

2595
01:19:54,451 --> 01:19:56,880
his housekeeper running
around out there at bargain,

2596
01:19:56,881 --> 01:19:58,980
more heroin farm and she got popped.

2597
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:03,180
It's hilarious that that guy
was like an antique truck guy.

2598
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:04,370
I mean it's,

2599
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:05,250
he's,

2600
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:06,330
he's performing,

2601
01:20:06,331 --> 01:20:07,100
you know,

2602
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:07,861
that's a show,

2603
01:20:07,861 --> 01:20:08,070
you

2604
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:08,700
know this.

2605
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:09,533
Yeah.

2606
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:11,130
But it's fascinating that the,

2607
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:12,300
those guys exist,

2608
01:20:12,301 --> 01:20:14,850
that the bill O'Reilly's the
rush Limbaugh type characters,

2609
01:20:14,851 --> 01:20:17,700
the people that really are
putting on an act and you know,

2610
01:20:17,701 --> 01:20:18,830
Stephen Colbert air,

2611
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:20,430
everybody thinks of him as,

2612
01:20:20,431 --> 01:20:20,671
you know,

2613
01:20:20,671 --> 01:20:20,971
this,

2614
01:20:20,971 --> 01:20:21,120
uh,

2615
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:21,330
it,

2616
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:21,680
it,

2617
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,440
you know,

2618
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:23,580
character richer,

2619
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:24,473
caricature.

2620
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,340
But they're all characatures.

2621
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:27,060
Absolutely.

2622
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:28,050
That's how they make their money.

2623
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:29,410
And you look at rush the most house,

2624
01:20:29,411 --> 01:20:30,270
it's fucking giant.

2625
01:20:30,430 --> 01:20:31,020
It's huge.

2626
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:34,440
People like what he does south there
golfing everyday with a hearing aid now

2627
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:34,980
cause he,

2628
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:37,040
he apparently did so much oxycontin,

2629
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:37,950
he fucked up his hearing.

2630
01:20:37,951 --> 01:20:38,784
You know,

2631
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:41,760
don't blame that on oxicon
plus with Alex Jones told me,

2632
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:43,630
well then don't blame that on octacopter.

2633
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,890
Alex Jones explained it to me
and some pseudo medical term.

2634
01:20:46,891 --> 01:20:47,401
Now just,

2635
01:20:47,401 --> 01:20:48,960
we'll pair it right back at you though.

2636
01:20:48,961 --> 01:20:49,351
I mean,

2637
01:20:49,351 --> 01:20:49,741
you know,

2638
01:20:49,741 --> 01:20:50,460
when you,

2639
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,380
when you say to kind of venom that,

2640
01:20:52,381 --> 01:20:53,370
that guy says,

2641
01:20:53,371 --> 01:20:53,701
you know,

2642
01:20:53,701 --> 01:20:55,560
somebody probably hit him upside,

2643
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,710
but don't blame that on Oxycontin.

2644
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:01,060
Is it possible to take so much oxycontin,

2645
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:01,291
ego,

2646
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:02,124
death?

2647
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:03,750
I am not aware of that.

2648
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:04,521
I and I,

2649
01:21:04,521 --> 01:21:05,910
I'm just not aware of that.

2650
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:06,660
I,

2651
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:07,110
yeah,

2652
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:08,730
I would have to do the research here.

2653
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:09,870
No,

2654
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:10,410
I mean,

2655
01:21:10,410 --> 01:21:13,980
I have been studying this issue
for a while and that just never,

2656
01:21:13,981 --> 01:21:14,814
ever heard of that.

2657
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,550
So I only heard it because of Alex Jones.

2658
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:18,391
I mean,

2659
01:21:18,391 --> 01:21:19,224
it's not the best.

2660
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:22,720
It's not wicked.

2661
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:23,850
He sent even Wikipedia,

2662
01:21:23,970 --> 01:21:24,950
he's great guy and everything,

2663
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,100
but you go deaf.

2664
01:21:26,101 --> 01:21:26,520
Let's see,

2665
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,390
let's see if it's true.

2666
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,320
It's a punch that shit.

2667
01:21:29,570 --> 01:21:30,930
And we will live in strange times,

2668
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:32,060
you know,

2669
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:33,420
but all right,

2670
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,270
really quickly,

2671
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:37,050
uh,

2672
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:38,940
he acknowledged he had gone
almost completely deaf.

2673
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:39,270
Nope.

2674
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:39,390
Didn't,

2675
01:21:39,390 --> 01:21:40,290
he's not admitting it.

2676
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:43,080
Who knows what it,

2677
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:46,110
how much oxicon like what's the
LD 50 for folks who don't know?

2678
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:47,220
I'm LD.

2679
01:21:47,221 --> 01:21:48,870
50 is lethal dose.

2680
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:49,711
50%.

2681
01:21:49,711 --> 01:21:50,470
So if you,

2682
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:50,670
uh,

2683
01:21:50,670 --> 01:21:52,260
some drugs it's very high.

2684
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:53,011
Some drugs,

2685
01:21:53,011 --> 01:21:54,600
it's very low marijuana.

2686
01:21:54,601 --> 01:21:55,410
It's insane.

2687
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:58,380
I don't know what the
LD 50 for Oxycontin is.

2688
01:21:58,381 --> 01:22:02,960
But one of the things about about
heroin or just any other opiate like Aki

2689
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:05,820
continents that if you've
been using it for a while,

2690
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,970
that means you can really
increase your dose of the drug.

2691
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:09,151
So,

2692
01:22:09,151 --> 01:22:09,481
you know,

2693
01:22:09,481 --> 01:22:14,481
I've seen heroin users take anywhere
from 25 milligrams of that drug to 500

2694
01:22:17,701 --> 01:22:18,390
milligrams.

2695
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:20,370
That's a why and be fine.

2696
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:21,020
Uh,

2697
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:22,520
and so it all depends on the,

2698
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:25,170
the user's history of using the drug.

2699
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:26,520
So he could,

2700
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:27,270
uh,

2701
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:30,300
I'm not surprised that Pete's been using
a drug for a while that he was using

2702
01:22:30,301 --> 01:22:31,051
large doses.

2703
01:22:31,051 --> 01:22:32,190
That doesn't surprise me.

2704
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:36,600
And that doesn't even concern
me if he was using large doses,

2705
01:22:36,601 --> 01:22:38,190
if he had developed tolerance.

2706
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:43,350
So if you develop tolerance and you're
taking say 50 pills a day or whatever he

2707
01:22:43,351 --> 01:22:44,130
was taking,

2708
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:48,630
that's no more dangerous than taking
one or two pills a day if you don't have

2709
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:49,510
the college for it.

2710
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:49,801
See,

2711
01:22:49,801 --> 01:22:54,110
one of the things that people don't talk
enough about in terms of drugs is sort

2712
01:22:54,111 --> 01:22:56,100
of protective effects of tolerance.

2713
01:22:56,370 --> 01:22:59,120
So when people develop
tolerance to any drugs,

2714
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,240
whether it be marijuana,

2715
01:23:00,241 --> 01:23:00,871
alcohol,

2716
01:23:00,871 --> 01:23:01,704
heroin,

2717
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:06,460
it protects you from some of the toxic
effects so you can push the dose without

2718
01:23:06,461 --> 01:23:08,230
having harmful effects.

2719
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:10,990
Let me just give you an
example from an animal study.

2720
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:15,520
Just one of the things that we reported
a that was reported in the literature

2721
01:23:15,521 --> 01:23:19,240
with laboratory animals
and methamphetamine is that
you give them a whopping

2722
01:23:19,241 --> 01:23:20,470
dose of that drug.

2723
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:23,320
You can cause neurotoxic effects.

2724
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:28,470
Brain cells die right now if you allow
that animal to develop tolerance by

2725
01:23:29,261 --> 01:23:31,660
giving escalating doses over several days,

2726
01:23:31,661 --> 01:23:36,400
and then you give them that whopping
dose you block to sort of neurotoxic oh

2727
01:23:36,410 --> 01:23:40,270
brain cell death as a result
of them developing tolerance.

2728
01:23:40,271 --> 01:23:45,271
So tolerance is important to protect the
animal from some of the toxic effects

2729
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:46,210
of the drug.

2730
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:46,991
That's fascinating.

2731
01:23:46,991 --> 01:23:51,730
So the LD 50 rate will absolutely change
with those who are tolerant to it from

2732
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:52,560
continued use.

2733
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:52,911
Yeah,

2734
01:23:52,911 --> 01:23:57,790
so the w the lethal dose will look
different based upon the user's history.

2735
01:23:58,240 --> 01:23:58,601
Okay.

2736
01:23:58,601 --> 01:24:00,430
So when they say like lethal dose,

2737
01:24:00,431 --> 01:24:03,550
50% or 50% of the population being,

2738
01:24:03,551 --> 01:24:06,850
you know like if you have 100 people and
then you give them a certain amount of

2739
01:24:06,851 --> 01:24:07,241
heroin,

2740
01:24:07,241 --> 01:24:10,300
50% of them die as soon as
they start taking that heroin,

2741
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:11,320
that number changes.

2742
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:12,041
That's right.

2743
01:24:12,041 --> 01:24:12,791
That number.

2744
01:24:12,791 --> 01:24:13,151
You know,

2745
01:24:13,151 --> 01:24:17,440
it's hard to predict when when we start
talking about people who have tolerance,

2746
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:17,981
I mean,

2747
01:24:17,981 --> 01:24:21,820
so when we think about the LD 50 we'd
typically talking about folks who doesn't

2748
01:24:21,821 --> 01:24:22,001
do,

2749
01:24:22,001 --> 01:24:23,680
don't have experience with the drug,

2750
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:28,930
and we do physically addict in some form
to a lot of drugs that you were talking

2751
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:32,320
about alcohol being one of the few that
if you physically addicted to it and you

2752
01:24:32,321 --> 01:24:33,090
quit,

2753
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:33,520
didn't that,

2754
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,930
isn't that when it happened
with Amy Winehouse?

2755
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,010
Didn't they show that her system had
nothing other than alcohol on it and

2756
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:39,130
nothing but alcohol?

2757
01:24:39,131 --> 01:24:41,170
But I'm not sure how she died.

2758
01:24:41,171 --> 01:24:41,490
I don't know.

2759
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:42,640
I don't want to get this wrong.

2760
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:43,930
Folks do die that way though,

2761
01:24:43,931 --> 01:24:44,290
right?

2762
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:44,591
Oh yeah.

2763
01:24:44,591 --> 01:24:46,750
You can die from alcohol withdrawal.

2764
01:24:46,751 --> 01:24:48,370
You die typically from seizures.

2765
01:24:48,371 --> 01:24:50,830
That's caused as a result
of the alcohol withdrawal.

2766
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:53,890
So if someone out there
is addicted to alcohol,

2767
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:55,150
how do they kick alcohol?

2768
01:24:55,151 --> 01:24:56,500
That they have to do it very slowly?

2769
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:57,250
Yeah.

2770
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:59,830
So if you develop dependence on alcohol,

2771
01:24:59,831 --> 01:25:03,680
you should probably be admitted to a
hospital in order to receive business with

2772
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:04,570
diazepines.

2773
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:05,200
Uh,

2774
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,880
something like Dad's a Pam of value,

2775
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:07,690
um,

2776
01:25:07,690 --> 01:25:10,120
which acts in a similar way as alcohol,

2777
01:25:10,121 --> 01:25:11,440
but it's longer lasting.

2778
01:25:11,441 --> 01:25:13,900
So the body has a chance to detoxify.

2779
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:16,750
The benzodiazepines
slowly leaves the body,

2780
01:25:16,751 --> 01:25:19,090
whereas alcohol abruptly leaves to body.

2781
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:22,780
And then that's what causes the seizure
activity and those sorts of things.

2782
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:25,780
What is the physiological effect of the
alcohol leaving the body and then the

2783
01:25:25,781 --> 01:25:26,141
seizure?

2784
01:25:26,141 --> 01:25:26,391
Like what,

2785
01:25:26,391 --> 01:25:29,020
what causes it to the
cause of the body to just,

2786
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:29,980
so when,

2787
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:30,843
um,

2788
01:25:31,130 --> 01:25:31,690
if you,

2789
01:25:31,690 --> 01:25:32,890
have you ever had a hangover?

2790
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:33,520
Yes.

2791
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:34,840
That's alcohol withdrawal.

2792
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:36,070
So what Halle?

2793
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:36,311
Yeah,

2794
01:25:36,311 --> 01:25:37,360
that's alcohol withdrawal.

2795
01:25:37,630 --> 01:25:38,470
Dehydration.

2796
01:25:38,650 --> 01:25:39,371
It's partly,

2797
01:25:39,371 --> 01:25:40,470
it's part of alcohol withdraw.

2798
01:25:40,471 --> 01:25:41,690
A dehydration is,

2799
01:25:41,691 --> 01:25:42,700
it's part of it as well.

2800
01:25:42,701 --> 01:25:43,300
But that's,

2801
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:45,790
that's like the mild symptoms
of alcohol withdrawal.

2802
01:25:46,270 --> 01:25:46,900
So,

2803
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:50,440
but when you think about the severe
sort of alcohol withdrawal that you're

2804
01:25:50,441 --> 01:25:51,221
asking about,

2805
01:25:51,221 --> 01:25:52,840
what happens with the seizure?

2806
01:25:52,841 --> 01:25:55,630
So the idea is that alcohol,

2807
01:25:55,631 --> 01:25:59,270
what it does is that it suppresses
much of the brain activity,

2808
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:01,090
much of the brain activity telling me,

2809
01:26:01,091 --> 01:26:01,420
man,

2810
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:02,860
it is just suppressed.

2811
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:04,370
And then for longterm

2812
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:05,510
use of alcohol,

2813
01:26:05,511 --> 01:26:07,700
it really suppresses a
number of brain cells.

2814
01:26:07,701 --> 01:26:08,960
And then all of a sudden,

2815
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:12,470
because alcohol's Halflife to time
in which half of the drug leaves,

2816
01:26:12,471 --> 01:26:14,390
the body is only about an hour.

2817
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:15,253
It's really quick.

2818
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:17,270
So the half life is so short.

2819
01:26:17,271 --> 01:26:22,271
Once the alcohol has left the body and
it's been depressing the central nervous

2820
01:26:22,971 --> 01:26:24,380
system to brain activity.

2821
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:25,700
Now all of a sudden dose,

2822
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:26,270
dose,

2823
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:29,600
dose cells fire wildly uncontrollably.

2824
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:33,660
And that's what causes the seizure
activity that's unbelieving,

2825
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:34,481
really fascinating.

2826
01:26:34,481 --> 01:26:38,980
So it's also unbelievably fascinating
that it's been proven that alcohol

2827
01:26:38,981 --> 01:26:42,700
actually suppresses the use of the
mind that the mind can't work as well.

2828
01:26:43,210 --> 01:26:43,481
Well,

2829
01:26:43,481 --> 01:26:44,170
I don't want,

2830
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:46,540
I don't want to say that strongly.

2831
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:47,130
I,

2832
01:26:47,130 --> 01:26:50,080
it certainly depresses a certain,

2833
01:26:50,081 --> 01:26:50,430
uh,

2834
01:26:50,430 --> 01:26:51,100
neurons,

2835
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:52,030
a number of neurons.

2836
01:26:52,031 --> 01:26:52,864
So like when you,

2837
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:54,100
when you think about it,

2838
01:26:54,101 --> 01:26:56,140
when you are anxious,

2839
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:57,810
if you're anxious and um,

2840
01:26:58,180 --> 01:26:59,350
and you have some alcohol,

2841
01:26:59,351 --> 01:27:00,610
if you have a Benzodiazepine,

2842
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:02,740
it's suppressing certain type of activity.

2843
01:27:02,741 --> 01:27:07,030
And so that's a good thing and you might
actually function better because if you

2844
01:27:07,031 --> 01:27:12,031
think about going to a party or having
some event and then you still anxious

2845
01:27:12,131 --> 01:27:16,810
where you can't perform as well and you
maybe have a drink and now you're calm

2846
01:27:16,811 --> 01:27:21,280
and you might actually be more social and
you might actually perform more better

2847
01:27:21,281 --> 01:27:22,180
in that situation.

2848
01:27:22,181 --> 01:27:24,130
So I don't want to say that it,

2849
01:27:24,131 --> 01:27:24,760
uh,

2850
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:29,650
that it's just sort of generalized a bad
effect on your behavior or the brain.

2851
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:32,270
So at certain low dosage
it can be beneficial.

2852
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:33,530
High dosages,

2853
01:27:33,710 --> 01:27:35,810
it does shut down certain
functions of the brain.

2854
01:27:35,811 --> 01:27:40,100
Like there's very few people that would
score as well on their sats after five

2855
01:27:40,101 --> 01:27:41,180
shots of Jack Daniels.

2856
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:41,981
Yeah,

2857
01:27:41,981 --> 01:27:42,791
I think that,

2858
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:43,210
um,

2859
01:27:43,210 --> 01:27:43,901
that's one of the thing,

2860
01:27:43,901 --> 01:27:46,750
we've been really good at public
education and most people know that they

2861
01:27:46,751 --> 01:27:49,870
shouldn't do shots before
taking the sats for that reason.

2862
01:27:49,871 --> 01:27:50,290
Right.

2863
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:51,580
Do you imagine if it made you smarter?

2864
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:52,953
Um,

2865
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:53,531
yeah.

2866
01:27:53,531 --> 01:27:53,891
I mean,

2867
01:27:53,891 --> 01:27:56,920
I can't imagine anything that makes you
smarter besides studying and working

2868
01:27:56,921 --> 01:27:57,640
hard

2869
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:58,390
for you.

2870
01:27:58,390 --> 01:27:59,860
That's a very good way to say that.

2871
01:27:59,890 --> 01:28:00,610
That's so true.

2872
01:28:00,610 --> 01:28:01,060
But,

2873
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:01,630
um,

2874
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:01,920
it,

2875
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,040
it's interesting though,

2876
01:28:03,041 --> 01:28:06,610
when you think about the idea that
this is one of the most popular,

2877
01:28:06,611 --> 01:28:09,610
if not the most popular
recreational drug in the world.

2878
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:10,091
Uh,

2879
01:28:10,091 --> 01:28:11,470
and one of the most popular,

2880
01:28:11,471 --> 01:28:15,400
the only big time sanctioned one in
America where you don't have to have a

2881
01:28:15,401 --> 01:28:16,234
sickness.

2882
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:17,970
Almost every drug that we have a,

2883
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,030
that it's a prescription drug,

2884
01:28:19,031 --> 01:28:20,440
whether it's good for you or bad for you,

2885
01:28:20,441 --> 01:28:21,274
dangerous,

2886
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:22,241
you know,

2887
01:28:22,241 --> 01:28:24,100
an incredibly potent,

2888
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:24,963
whatever it is.

2889
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,160
You have to get a prescription.

2890
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,160
It has to be a reason for it.

2891
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,720
You don't need a reason
to get fucked up on booze.

2892
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:30,011
He just,

2893
01:28:30,011 --> 01:28:33,910
there's Mikey's bar and you walk on it
and give me a double on a beer and then

2894
01:28:33,911 --> 01:28:34,570
boom,

2895
01:28:34,570 --> 01:28:35,920
20 minutes later you're drunk,

2896
01:28:36,070 --> 01:28:36,341
you know,

2897
01:28:36,341 --> 01:28:37,480
and we don't need any,

2898
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:39,070
no reasons,

2899
01:28:39,071 --> 01:28:39,820
no doctor.

2900
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:40,990
And nobody has to hold your hand.

2901
01:28:40,991 --> 01:28:42,080
You don't have to write anything down.

2902
01:28:42,081 --> 01:28:44,710
You don't have to give the guy your
name and phone number and I'm trying to

2903
01:28:44,711 --> 01:28:48,250
figure out are you saying that's a bad
thing or good thing fascinated by it.

2904
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:49,120
I mean I'm neither,

2905
01:28:49,121 --> 01:28:50,620
I'm not saying it's a good or a bad thing.

2906
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:53,380
I if I had to say should
it be legal or illegal?

2907
01:28:53,381 --> 01:28:54,350
I would say absolutely legal.

2908
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:54,610
We,

2909
01:28:54,610 --> 01:28:54,940
I,

2910
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:56,890
I've enjoyed alcohol
many times in my life.

2911
01:28:56,891 --> 01:29:01,891
I don't have a problem with alcohol but
it is very telling and that that is the

2912
01:29:02,611 --> 01:29:03,810
one drug that we chose.

2913
01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:05,400
Well it is for a number of

2914
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:06,031
reasons.

2915
01:29:06,031 --> 01:29:06,230
Um,

2916
01:29:06,230 --> 01:29:07,800
I mean when you think about it,

2917
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:08,970
how we do alcohol,

2918
01:29:08,971 --> 01:29:13,971
we take it orally and so it's the only
drug that we take orally that you can

2919
01:29:14,581 --> 01:29:16,830
feel the effects almost immediately.

2920
01:29:17,190 --> 01:29:18,630
And so when you were at a party,

2921
01:29:18,631 --> 01:29:21,330
you don't have to wait for the
onset of the effects that happen.

2922
01:29:21,331 --> 01:29:25,830
It happens almost immediately and you
control the intoxication simply by taking

2923
01:29:25,831 --> 01:29:29,370
more or less of the drug can't
do that with other drugs orally.

2924
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:33,010
And so the f a and that's
one reason that that's it,

2925
01:29:33,110 --> 01:29:37,500
that that's the case is because alcohol
essentially has no barrier blood brain

2926
01:29:37,501 --> 01:29:38,250
barrier.

2927
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:39,420
Like those other drugs,

2928
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:41,820
they have to cross the
blame blood brain barrier.

2929
01:29:41,821 --> 01:29:42,654
What alcohol.

2930
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:44,610
There are essentially
no barrier for alcohol.

2931
01:29:44,611 --> 01:29:49,410
So you can the pharmacokinetics
or pharmacology properties
of the drug makes it

2932
01:29:49,411 --> 01:29:52,740
very convenient for a recreational drug.

2933
01:29:52,741 --> 01:29:53,160
That's,

2934
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:56,130
that's another important
reason that it's legal.

2935
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:56,691
Yeah,

2936
01:29:56,691 --> 01:29:57,650
that's a good point.

2937
01:29:57,660 --> 01:30:01,010
Can you consider like if you were going
to open up like a mushroom store and

2938
01:30:01,011 --> 01:30:02,240
everybody come in and saw mushrooms,

2939
01:30:02,241 --> 01:30:03,470
you'd give him the mushrooms and be like,

2940
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:07,960
come back and hang out in an hour and
20 minutes because for the next hour,

2941
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,510
you know,

2942
01:30:08,510 --> 01:30:09,680
nothing really is going to happen.

2943
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:11,480
You're going to start sweating,

2944
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:12,710
you know,

2945
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:13,220
um,

2946
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:14,090
but alcohol,

2947
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:15,710
one shot to shot,

2948
01:30:15,711 --> 01:30:16,544
you're feeling it,

2949
01:30:17,030 --> 01:30:17,570
you're doing it,

2950
01:30:17,570 --> 01:30:18,640
do the oral route.

2951
01:30:18,641 --> 01:30:20,320
So when you take a drug orally,

2952
01:30:20,410 --> 01:30:23,200
some of it will be broken down
before it reaches the brain,

2953
01:30:23,201 --> 01:30:26,950
which is the good thing because that
means that you don't have such large doses

2954
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:28,950
being shot into your vein or smoked.

2955
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,790
And your lungs until the brain.

2956
01:30:30,791 --> 01:30:33,640
And so it's kind of
protective in that way.

2957
01:30:33,940 --> 01:30:37,180
And so those from a
pharmacology properties,

2958
01:30:37,210 --> 01:30:38,270
just a,

2959
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:41,100
I can't think of another drug
that has such good progress.

2960
01:30:41,690 --> 01:30:41,901
Yeah,

2961
01:30:41,901 --> 01:30:43,250
I couldn't think of another drug either.

2962
01:30:43,251 --> 01:30:43,910
But if you,

2963
01:30:43,910 --> 01:30:45,080
if you were doing marijuana,

2964
01:30:45,081 --> 01:30:48,470
the issue would be that you would get
people around you high as well through

2965
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:49,730
secondhand intoxication.

2966
01:30:50,230 --> 01:30:50,680
Well,

2967
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:52,990
it's not only that you
have to actually smoke it,

2968
01:30:52,991 --> 01:30:56,980
but were there are better methods now you
got vaporizers and that sort of thing.

2969
01:30:56,981 --> 01:30:59,920
So you can smoke
marijuana more discretely.

2970
01:30:59,921 --> 01:31:01,690
And as the sort of methods,

2971
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:02,101
uh,

2972
01:31:02,101 --> 01:31:02,934
our develop,

2973
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:05,470
it might become a more social drug,

2974
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:10,360
but we still have the issue of getting
large amounts into the bloodstream,

2975
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:12,890
therefore into the brain
in such a rapid success.

2976
01:31:12,891 --> 01:31:13,230
And,

2977
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:16,060
and that's the thing that
worries us in terms of safety.

2978
01:31:16,330 --> 01:31:20,950
And so people need to be able to need
to be educated on how to make sure that

2979
01:31:20,951 --> 01:31:23,680
they don't take too much of a large dose,

2980
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:24,400
um,

2981
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,120
at once.

2982
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,890
And once you do that,

2983
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:28,780
you can help people be safe.

2984
01:31:28,781 --> 01:31:29,650
But alcohol,

2985
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,270
they'll have so much worry about it.

2986
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:34,690
The thing that we try and prevent people
from doing this binge drinking because

2987
01:31:34,691 --> 01:31:39,580
of having large amounts in such a
rapid amount of time that it just,

2988
01:31:39,581 --> 01:31:41,260
your body can't process it quickly now.

2989
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:41,561
Yeah.

2990
01:31:41,561 --> 01:31:42,210
It's just,

2991
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:42,730
well,

2992
01:31:42,730 --> 01:31:43,211
you know,

2993
01:31:43,211 --> 01:31:48,211
toxicity occurs primarily because of
the large amount at a rapid sensation,

2994
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:50,560
a rapid sort of,

2995
01:31:50,770 --> 01:31:51,100
uh,

2996
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:51,940
in rapid order.

2997
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:52,870
But what about,

2998
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:53,140
well,

2999
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:58,060
I mean the other big issue with alcohol
as opposed to marijuana is coordination,

3000
01:31:58,480 --> 01:31:59,050
uh,

3001
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:03,070
drastically affects coordination
drastically affects your ability to move

3002
01:32:03,071 --> 01:32:03,641
correctly.

3003
01:32:03,641 --> 01:32:04,990
Your Response Times.

3004
01:32:05,450 --> 01:32:05,901
Yeah.

3005
01:32:05,901 --> 01:32:08,120
Well it all depends dose again,

3006
01:32:08,150 --> 01:32:08,571
you know,

3007
01:32:08,571 --> 01:32:11,060
so it all depends how
much people are taking,

3008
01:32:11,061 --> 01:32:11,370
you know,

3009
01:32:11,370 --> 01:32:12,680
like all of these drugs.

3010
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,330
One of the things I try and point out,

3011
01:32:14,331 --> 01:32:17,270
the most important thing
about drugs is dose.

3012
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:17,871
You know,

3013
01:32:17,871 --> 01:32:19,430
as you increase the dose,

3014
01:32:19,670 --> 01:32:23,870
you increase the likelihood of toxicity
because there are doses in which you can

3015
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:27,920
take all of these drugs safely and
accomplish whatever task you're trying to

3016
01:32:27,921 --> 01:32:28,754
accomplish.

3017
01:32:28,820 --> 01:32:30,200
But it's all about dose.

3018
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:33,680
So when we say general statements
about what alcohol does it,

3019
01:32:33,681 --> 01:32:34,700
what cocaine does,

3020
01:32:34,701 --> 01:32:36,630
we have to be cognizant of dose

3021
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:39,810
about drinking and driving though.

3022
01:32:40,350 --> 01:32:41,041
What is the,

3023
01:32:41,041 --> 01:32:41,420
uh,

3024
01:32:41,420 --> 01:32:41,790
the,

3025
01:32:41,790 --> 01:32:42,960
when you see the,

3026
01:32:42,961 --> 01:32:43,320
um,

3027
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:44,101
the limits,

3028
01:32:44,101 --> 01:32:44,740
I don't remember what,

3029
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:45,070
what are,

3030
01:32:45,070 --> 01:32:46,740
what are the current national limits?

3031
01:32:46,741 --> 01:32:46,980
You know,

3032
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:49,380
they've married a little bit and
I actually think they loan them,

3033
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:50,910
lowered them in certain places.

3034
01:32:51,180 --> 01:32:54,240
Do you think that they're fair
where they're at right now?

3035
01:32:54,270 --> 01:32:55,650
Do you think they should be adjusted?

3036
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:56,030
What are,

3037
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:56,863
what are your thoughts?

3038
01:32:57,020 --> 01:32:57,250
No,

3039
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:58,180
I think they're fair.

3040
01:32:58,570 --> 01:32:59,081
I mean,

3041
01:32:59,081 --> 01:33:00,460
they're the best we can do.

3042
01:33:00,461 --> 01:33:01,130
And then we,

3043
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:01,901
we also have,

3044
01:33:01,901 --> 01:33:04,210
those were roadside tests
and those kinds of things.

3045
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:05,530
It's the best that we can do.

3046
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:06,261
And I,

3047
01:33:06,261 --> 01:33:11,261
I think we're doing a really good job
at sort of a alcohol related drinking.

3048
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:12,551
Uh,

3049
01:33:12,551 --> 01:33:12,851
I mean,

3050
01:33:12,851 --> 01:33:17,851
driving problems when we look at what
issues we had in 1960s compared to what we

3051
01:33:18,881 --> 01:33:19,714
have now,

3052
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:23,890
the number of accidents and deaths
related to driving hab dramatically

3053
01:33:23,891 --> 01:33:24,581
decreased.

3054
01:33:24,581 --> 01:33:25,660
All those sorts of things,

3055
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:27,910
in part because of our education,

3056
01:33:28,150 --> 01:33:29,620
because of what we're doing.

3057
01:33:29,650 --> 01:33:29,891
Um,

3058
01:33:29,891 --> 01:33:30,760
so I think we're,

3059
01:33:30,761 --> 01:33:31,001
we're,

3060
01:33:31,001 --> 01:33:32,080
we're going about that,

3061
01:33:32,110 --> 01:33:32,943
uh,

3062
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:34,400
quite well and appropriate.

3063
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:36,240
What about tolerance?

3064
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:36,750
Yeah.

3065
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:37,770
In relates to that,

3066
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,830
because for a person who
doesn't drink at all,

3067
01:33:40,831 --> 01:33:41,581
if they have a point,

3068
01:33:41,581 --> 01:33:42,390
whatever,

3069
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:45,690
and then you get some dude who's just
hitting it hard every night and he's only

3070
01:33:45,691 --> 01:33:46,890
had one or two beers,

3071
01:33:46,891 --> 01:33:48,030
but if he gets pulled over,

3072
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:49,073
he's going to,

3073
01:33:49,470 --> 01:33:51,180
he's going to test too high.

3074
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:55,290
But his tolerance might be
so that he would be fine.

3075
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:57,150
You're absolutely right.

3076
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:59,140
And that's one thing that these sort of,

3077
01:33:59,141 --> 01:33:59,690
um,

3078
01:33:59,690 --> 01:33:59,851
uh,

3079
01:33:59,851 --> 01:34:02,520
criteria don't account for his tolerance,

3080
01:34:02,610 --> 01:34:06,240
but I'm a good lawyer who has to defend.

3081
01:34:06,241 --> 01:34:08,620
Someone should probably
bring in tolerance,

3082
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:08,970
uh,

3083
01:34:08,970 --> 01:34:12,270
particularly if their client is
tolerant to the alcohol effects.

3084
01:34:12,271 --> 01:34:13,440
But good luck.

3085
01:34:13,441 --> 01:34:17,700
That's a tough one because people
think that they have this deaf definite

3086
01:34:17,701 --> 01:34:21,630
measure and it tells them something and
it really doesn't without understanding

3087
01:34:21,631 --> 01:34:22,200
tolerance.

3088
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:23,340
But you're absolutely right.

3089
01:34:23,341 --> 01:34:24,180
That's a great question.

3090
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:26,270
So a universal number like that,

3091
01:34:26,271 --> 01:34:29,600
it's an inherently on scientific
knowing and understanding

3092
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:32,680
a universal number like that is not,

3093
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:34,600
it does not apply to everyone.

3094
01:34:34,630 --> 01:34:36,250
It does not consider tolerance.

3095
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:36,940
That's right,

3096
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:40,960
but it's the best that we
have currently other than,

3097
01:34:40,961 --> 01:34:41,360
you know,

3098
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:42,910
the hand eye coordination drills.

3099
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:43,773
That's all right.

3100
01:34:43,870 --> 01:34:44,381
Those are,

3101
01:34:44,381 --> 01:34:45,214
that's the thing.

3102
01:34:45,370 --> 01:34:47,470
It's the behavioral
tests that are important.

3103
01:34:47,471 --> 01:34:51,760
You want to see how impaired
behaviorly impaired to person is.

3104
01:34:52,010 --> 01:34:52,320
Um,

3105
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:55,180
because if you have that in
combination with the blood levels,

3106
01:34:55,181 --> 01:34:56,014
then you,

3107
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:59,150
you have an confidence
of what you're seeing.

3108
01:34:59,151 --> 01:34:59,961
But if you have,

3109
01:34:59,961 --> 01:35:00,561
for example,

3110
01:35:00,561 --> 01:35:03,380
somebody testing over the
limit based on their blood,

3111
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:05,180
but their hand coordination,

3112
01:35:05,181 --> 01:35:06,650
they pass a sobriety test,

3113
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:10,130
then you're less confident in
what that blood level means.

3114
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:10,710
Right.

3115
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:11,543
That makes sense.

3116
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:12,110
Is it,

3117
01:35:12,110 --> 01:35:15,750
is there any other variables as far as
like a person's ability to pass a hand

3118
01:35:15,751 --> 01:35:17,280
eye coordination test when they're drunk?

3119
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:19,530
I mean that flick ability,

3120
01:35:19,710 --> 01:35:23,400
things along those lines because some
people they could barely bend down to

3121
01:35:23,401 --> 01:35:24,234
touch their shoes,

3122
01:35:24,450 --> 01:35:26,340
whereas other people are yoga masters.

3123
01:35:26,341 --> 01:35:28,710
If you've got a yoga master
fucked up and you know,

3124
01:35:29,150 --> 01:35:32,310
you might be able to just put his foot
over his head while he's hammered and the

3125
01:35:32,311 --> 01:35:33,061
cops be like,

3126
01:35:33,061 --> 01:35:33,894
this guy's sober.

3127
01:35:34,750 --> 01:35:35,561
Well that's right.

3128
01:35:35,561 --> 01:35:36,041
You know,

3129
01:35:36,041 --> 01:35:40,150
if people have practice with the test
and they know how to do it really well,

3130
01:35:40,510 --> 01:35:41,001
um,

3131
01:35:41,001 --> 01:35:41,780
then maybe they are,

3132
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:43,810
they're not impaired driving as well.

3133
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:44,351
I don't know.

3134
01:35:44,351 --> 01:35:44,771
But yeah.

3135
01:35:44,771 --> 01:35:46,870
But all of those issues that you bring up,

3136
01:35:46,871 --> 01:35:47,201
man,

3137
01:35:47,201 --> 01:35:48,034
do are,

3138
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:52,300
those are complex issues and those issues
that the society has to struggle with,

3139
01:35:52,301 --> 01:35:55,600
but they won't do struggle with it
because it's too complicated and it's just

3140
01:35:55,690 --> 01:35:57,340
nicer to have a number.

3141
01:35:57,630 --> 01:35:57,781
No.

3142
01:35:57,781 --> 01:36:01,140
How does a state like Florida
become this weird aberration?

3143
01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:02,970
How's the state like Florida have?

3144
01:36:02,971 --> 01:36:06,720
So mainly they said 90% of all the,

3145
01:36:06,721 --> 01:36:06,901
uh,

3146
01:36:06,901 --> 01:36:09,390
oxycodone pharmacies,

3147
01:36:09,391 --> 01:36:10,860
the pharmacies that are
making it and selling it.

3148
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:11,520
How,

3149
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,301
how does that happen?

3150
01:36:12,301 --> 01:36:14,580
How does one stage just go haywire?

3151
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:15,880
You know,

3152
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:17,200
I don't know the Florida law,

3153
01:36:17,201 --> 01:36:19,820
but I'm sure it's related to the purse.

3154
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:21,140
I'm sorry.

3155
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:21,371
Does,

3156
01:36:21,371 --> 01:36:23,290
so the permissiveness of their law.

3157
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:26,710
I think that that's the thing
that contributed to this.

3158
01:36:26,711 --> 01:36:27,180
I mean,

3159
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:30,910
they probably were allowed to set
up pain clinics in a way that,

3160
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:31,480
uh,

3161
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:34,390
you didn't require a
much sort of oversight.

3162
01:36:34,391 --> 01:36:35,020
And then,

3163
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:35,470
um,

3164
01:36:35,470 --> 01:36:35,860
so,

3165
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:36,520
uh,

3166
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:38,050
whenever those kinds of things happen,

3167
01:36:38,051 --> 01:36:38,291
you know,

3168
01:36:38,291 --> 01:36:39,100
there's a,

3169
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:39,890
there's a,

3170
01:36:39,890 --> 01:36:41,860
a potential for abuse.

3171
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:42,840
And so I,

3172
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:43,873
I would suggest,

3173
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:45,880
I would probably guess
that's what happened.

3174
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:51,030
I was also wondering if maybe it might
be some of the remnants of the cocaine

3175
01:36:51,031 --> 01:36:52,980
era of Miami about how,

3176
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,480
did you ever see cocaine cowboys?

3177
01:36:54,481 --> 01:36:55,380
You ever see that documentary?

3178
01:36:55,381 --> 01:36:55,581
Yeah.

3179
01:36:55,581 --> 01:36:55,801
Yeah.

3180
01:36:55,801 --> 01:36:56,461
I'm from Miami,

3181
01:36:56,461 --> 01:36:56,730
so,

3182
01:36:56,730 --> 01:36:57,420
okay.

3183
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:00,360
Cocaine cowboys and cocaine cowboys to,

3184
01:37:00,380 --> 01:37:00,630
uh,

3185
01:37:00,630 --> 01:37:03,000
shout out to my friend Billy
Corbin who made those movies.

3186
01:37:03,001 --> 01:37:03,840
I met that dude.

3187
01:37:03,841 --> 01:37:05,670
Very nice guy and a really,

3188
01:37:05,671 --> 01:37:10,050
really fascinating documentaries
that cover the whole cocaine,

3189
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:10,923
um,

3190
01:37:11,250 --> 01:37:15,690
era of Miami where one
year the graduating class,

3191
01:37:15,691 --> 01:37:16,501
the police academy,

3192
01:37:16,501 --> 01:37:21,501
every single member either wound up dead
from murder or in jail for corruption.

3193
01:37:22,230 --> 01:37:27,230
Like they were just crazy and making money
off of coke and coke is moving in and

3194
01:37:27,291 --> 01:37:27,690
out.

3195
01:37:27,690 --> 01:37:32,100
And I had always wondered if maybe that
had something to do with like Sorta the

3196
01:37:32,101 --> 01:37:33,150
echoes of this,

3197
01:37:33,151 --> 01:37:36,240
a pervasiveness of drugs in that state.

3198
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:37,381
Wow.

3199
01:37:37,381 --> 01:37:37,651
Man.

3200
01:37:37,651 --> 01:37:38,041
You know,

3201
01:37:38,041 --> 01:37:39,840
I haven't lived in Miami,

3202
01:37:39,990 --> 01:37:42,000
Florida since 1984.

3203
01:37:42,150 --> 01:37:42,720
Uh,

3204
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:44,820
Florida is a bizarre state in general,

3205
01:37:44,910 --> 01:37:45,241
you know,

3206
01:37:45,241 --> 01:37:45,851
so I,

3207
01:37:45,851 --> 01:37:46,451
I have to,

3208
01:37:46,451 --> 01:37:47,284
do,

3209
01:37:47,310 --> 01:37:48,610
I have to say that I'm,

3210
01:37:48,611 --> 01:37:48,820
I'm,

3211
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:49,021
I'm,

3212
01:37:49,021 --> 01:37:52,560
I'm outside of the scope of my expertise
when it comes to trying to understand

3213
01:37:52,561 --> 01:37:52,921
Florida.

3214
01:37:52,921 --> 01:37:53,640
I don't,

3215
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:54,930
I don't understand Florida.

3216
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:55,231
Well,

3217
01:37:55,231 --> 01:37:56,310
they said that there's more

3218
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:59,940
banks per capita in Miami than
any other city in the country.

3219
01:37:59,941 --> 01:38:03,120
And that is directly related to
their ability to process money.

3220
01:38:03,450 --> 01:38:04,380
That was Koch money.

3221
01:38:04,650 --> 01:38:05,041
Yeah.

3222
01:38:05,041 --> 01:38:05,401
I mean,

3223
01:38:05,401 --> 01:38:07,550
I grew up in that area or you know,

3224
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:11,970
the late seventies and early
eighties and the Scarface era,

3225
01:38:11,971 --> 01:38:12,804
you know,

3226
01:38:13,290 --> 01:38:16,410
1980 was a peak murder
rate in this country.

3227
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:16,621
You know,

3228
01:38:16,621 --> 01:38:20,430
one of the highest murder rates was in
1980 in part because of the cocaine.

3229
01:38:20,431 --> 01:38:23,310
So to thing mind you long before crack,

3230
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:25,350
but nobody's really talking about that.

3231
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:26,633
Um,

3232
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:27,541
and so yeah,

3233
01:38:27,541 --> 01:38:29,010
I know that era.

3234
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:29,490
Uh,

3235
01:38:29,490 --> 01:38:32,670
and I know that cocaine
was a big deal in Miami,

3236
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:35,850
but my friend Steve did
his residency in Miami and,

3237
01:38:35,851 --> 01:38:36,090
uh,

3238
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:41,090
it was during that era and he just
got just crazy stories of violence of,

3239
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:43,740
of just people coming in
and just all fucked up.

3240
01:38:43,741 --> 01:38:44,011
And it was,

3241
01:38:44,011 --> 01:38:45,330
a lot of it was drug wars.

3242
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:45,920
Yeah.

3243
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,850
Well how did that all
of a sudden happened?

3244
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:49,110
Do you know the history,

3245
01:38:49,111 --> 01:38:50,160
new drug markets,

3246
01:38:50,161 --> 01:38:50,630
you know,

3247
01:38:50,630 --> 01:38:51,000
it,

3248
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:55,050
how did these drug markets opened up mean
what took so long that it took to the

3249
01:38:55,051 --> 01:38:56,550
1980s for them to get over here?

3250
01:38:56,820 --> 01:38:57,211
Well,

3251
01:38:57,211 --> 01:38:57,661
I think,

3252
01:38:57,661 --> 01:38:57,931
well,

3253
01:38:57,931 --> 01:38:58,590
well,

3254
01:38:58,590 --> 01:39:03,590
the story that I heard and I haven't
researched as to the best of my ability,

3255
01:39:03,841 --> 01:39:07,630
so this is only what I've
read superficially is that a,

3256
01:39:07,690 --> 01:39:09,510
there was a crackdown on marijuana,

3257
01:39:09,511 --> 01:39:11,820
a big crackdown in the 70s on marijuana.

3258
01:39:11,821 --> 01:39:16,821
And then so the drug cartels brought in
cocaine because it was smaller way and

3259
01:39:18,361 --> 01:39:19,440
you can make more money.

3260
01:39:19,441 --> 01:39:19,771
And then,

3261
01:39:19,771 --> 01:39:24,510
so that was about the time when cocaine
started to flood the u s markets.

3262
01:39:24,690 --> 01:39:25,140
Um,

3263
01:39:25,140 --> 01:39:28,110
that's what I've read as far as that goes.

3264
01:39:28,111 --> 01:39:28,944
But like I said,

3265
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:32,250
it's a superficial read
of my understanding of it.

3266
01:39:32,430 --> 01:39:34,680
So really all crack cocaine was,

3267
01:39:34,681 --> 01:39:37,080
was like the second wave of cocaine.

3268
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:40,350
It's like cocaine came when
they figured out there's a,

3269
01:39:40,351 --> 01:39:42,790
an opening because of
marijuana crackdowns.

3270
01:39:43,230 --> 01:39:44,160
And then they said,

3271
01:39:44,161 --> 01:39:44,311
well,

3272
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:46,620
we've got to figure out a way to get
it to people that can't afford to buy a

3273
01:39:46,621 --> 01:39:47,400
brick.

3274
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:47,671
Yeah,

3275
01:39:47,671 --> 01:39:47,881
no,

3276
01:39:47,881 --> 01:39:48,391
absolutely.

3277
01:39:48,391 --> 01:39:53,391
Some industries to a dealer figured out
how to cook cocaine and produce mass,

3278
01:39:55,111 --> 01:39:58,950
produce it in ways that people
could smoke it at cheap unit doses.

3279
01:39:59,370 --> 01:39:59,731
I mean,

3280
01:39:59,731 --> 01:40:00,060
that's,

3281
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:01,530
that's brilliant quite frankly.

3282
01:40:01,710 --> 01:40:02,310
Um,

3283
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:03,660
that is when you think about it that way,

3284
01:40:05,310 --> 01:40:05,611
you know,

3285
01:40:05,611 --> 01:40:07,680
but that person is brilliant.

3286
01:40:07,681 --> 01:40:12,681
Whereas whoever rig the laws in Florida
to allow oxycontin's to come in and,

3287
01:40:13,411 --> 01:40:13,771
you know,

3288
01:40:13,771 --> 01:40:13,990
the,

3289
01:40:13,990 --> 01:40:14,250
the,

3290
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:14,611
you know,

3291
01:40:14,611 --> 01:40:15,870
we look at that and we go,

3292
01:40:15,871 --> 01:40:16,021
well,

3293
01:40:16,021 --> 01:40:16,810
this person a,

3294
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:17,760
this is corruption.

3295
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:18,900
You know,

3296
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:19,733
this is a,

3297
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:21,780
this is what they've done is terrible.

3298
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:22,591
Well,

3299
01:40:22,591 --> 01:40:23,041
you know,

3300
01:40:23,041 --> 01:40:23,730
uh,

3301
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:24,760
I don't know the law,

3302
01:40:24,761 --> 01:40:27,390
so it's hard for me to speak
on the specifics of that.

3303
01:40:27,391 --> 01:40:27,571
But,

3304
01:40:27,571 --> 01:40:28,110
um,

3305
01:40:28,110 --> 01:40:28,730
and so,

3306
01:40:28,730 --> 01:40:29,540
um,

3307
01:40:29,540 --> 01:40:30,450
I don't know.

3308
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:31,110
I don't know,

3309
01:40:31,110 --> 01:40:34,650
the person could have had a
great idea and probably meant,

3310
01:40:34,651 --> 01:40:36,090
well I don't know,

3311
01:40:36,091 --> 01:40:40,590
but it certainly doesn't
seem to be playing out as
well as we would have liked.

3312
01:40:40,890 --> 01:40:43,200
Now when you start to
do these studies and uh,

3313
01:40:43,201 --> 01:40:43,590
you know,

3314
01:40:43,590 --> 01:40:45,620
you're in the 1990s and you're,

3315
01:40:45,630 --> 01:40:49,950
you're finding things that
are contradictory to what
we normally consider to be

3316
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:52,890
the culturally accepted
ideas about these drugs.

3317
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:54,010
Um,

3318
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:54,521
what,

3319
01:40:54,521 --> 01:40:55,300
what happens,

3320
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:57,930
do you get resistance from people in,

3321
01:40:57,931 --> 01:41:00,640
in universities to get
resistance from your peers?

3322
01:41:01,220 --> 01:41:01,641
No.

3323
01:41:01,641 --> 01:41:02,420
Um,

3324
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:03,101
you know,

3325
01:41:03,101 --> 01:41:03,410
uh,

3326
01:41:03,410 --> 01:41:06,230
how science works is that
you publish these stories.

3327
01:41:06,231 --> 01:41:06,680
One,

3328
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:11,680
one study doesn't mean as much as multiple
studies and so you publish one study

3329
01:41:11,721 --> 01:41:12,111
and it's like,

3330
01:41:12,111 --> 01:41:13,010
that's a great finding.

3331
01:41:13,011 --> 01:41:13,840
Cool.

3332
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:15,560
And I see if you can replicate it,

3333
01:41:15,561 --> 01:41:16,820
let's see if you can extend it.

3334
01:41:16,821 --> 01:41:18,650
Let's see if other
people can replicate it.

3335
01:41:18,651 --> 01:41:20,690
And if other people can replicate it,

3336
01:41:20,691 --> 01:41:24,860
you can extend the findings now you feel
more confident in what you're finding.

3337
01:41:24,861 --> 01:41:25,820
And so that,

3338
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,190
that's kind of what
happened over the years.

3339
01:41:28,550 --> 01:41:29,290
I build,

3340
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:32,750
I build on my findings and in
an increased my confidence,

3341
01:41:32,751 --> 01:41:37,490
so much so that I thought that I should
write a book in order to make sure the

3342
01:41:37,491 --> 01:41:39,320
public understands what's happening.

3343
01:41:39,321 --> 01:41:42,200
Because when you publish in
the scientific literature,

3344
01:41:42,860 --> 01:41:44,480
five people read your paper.

3345
01:41:44,660 --> 01:41:45,493
If you're lucky,

3346
01:41:45,710 --> 01:41:45,981
you know,

3347
01:41:45,981 --> 01:41:46,611
people there,

3348
01:41:46,611 --> 01:41:48,740
there's not many people
who read the literature.

3349
01:41:48,780 --> 01:41:49,160
Um,

3350
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:51,650
besides those few people who
are interested in your area.

3351
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:54,860
And so as I increased my
confidence in the findings,

3352
01:41:54,861 --> 01:41:59,390
I thought I wanted to publicize it
because I thought what we were doing with

3353
01:41:59,391 --> 01:42:03,950
drugs was inconsistent in terms of policy
and the way we educate and treat drugs

3354
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:05,690
was inconsistent with the science.

3355
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:09,920
And the way that you communicate
with the people was to write a book,

3356
01:42:09,921 --> 01:42:10,754
a trade book.

3357
01:42:11,190 --> 01:42:12,023
Now,

3358
01:42:12,030 --> 01:42:13,230
how's this book been received?

3359
01:42:13,231 --> 01:42:13,380
Have,

3360
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:14,213
is there any,

3361
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:16,560
like if you have a debate about it,

3362
01:42:16,561 --> 01:42:17,760
is anybody ever said,

3363
01:42:17,761 --> 01:42:19,170
I challenge you on your ideas?

3364
01:42:19,171 --> 01:42:20,070
These are not correct.

3365
01:42:20,071 --> 01:42:20,904
This is not true.

3366
01:42:20,970 --> 01:42:23,430
Have you ever had to like sit down with
Ann Coulter or anything along those

3367
01:42:23,431 --> 01:42:24,264
lines?

3368
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:25,041
Well,

3369
01:42:25,041 --> 01:42:26,420
I don't think she's qualified.

3370
01:42:26,421 --> 01:42:28,280
That'd be challenging me quite frankly,

3371
01:42:28,281 --> 01:42:29,150
about drugs.

3372
01:42:29,170 --> 01:42:30,003
Um,

3373
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:31,370
but she would do it anyway.

3374
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:32,181
Yeah,

3375
01:42:32,181 --> 01:42:33,014
I know.

3376
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:36,890
She might embarrass herself
if she did I show you.

3377
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:38,233
Um,

3378
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:39,081
but,

3379
01:42:39,081 --> 01:42:39,914
um,

3380
01:42:40,010 --> 01:42:40,460
uh,

3381
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:41,840
they're happening as possible.

3382
01:42:41,870 --> 01:42:43,310
There have been people who,

3383
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:44,173
uh,

3384
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:45,273
uh,

3385
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:50,150
who may say that they have some trouble
with the conclusions that I draw,

3386
01:42:50,151 --> 01:42:55,151
but the scientific community
and the general public have
been welcoming and it's

3387
01:42:55,551 --> 01:43:00,410
been a breath of fresh air for most
people because people already know this.

3388
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:04,370
The things that I'm saying about drugs
like the fact that the vast majority of

3389
01:43:04,371 --> 01:43:07,310
people who use drugs are not drug addicts.

3390
01:43:07,850 --> 01:43:12,620
That's not really that groundbreaking
to people who actually know drugs and

3391
01:43:12,621 --> 01:43:13,730
people who are critical.

3392
01:43:14,060 --> 01:43:15,050
That's not groundbreaking.

3393
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:16,140
Um,

3394
01:43:16,140 --> 01:43:16,400
what's,

3395
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:16,890
what's

3396
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:21,360
groundbreaking is that it's being said
in a public forum because it's never been

3397
01:43:21,361 --> 01:43:22,260
said in a public forum.

3398
01:43:22,261 --> 01:43:24,330
It's always been the exact opposite.

3399
01:43:24,510 --> 01:43:26,070
It's always been the propaganda.

3400
01:43:26,310 --> 01:43:30,240
And what's really refreshing about what
you're doing is the fact that you are

3401
01:43:30,241 --> 01:43:34,020
pushing fact first regardless of
how it's going to be accepted.

3402
01:43:34,050 --> 01:43:34,831
That you're just saying,

3403
01:43:34,831 --> 01:43:35,011
look,

3404
01:43:35,011 --> 01:43:35,281
this is,

3405
01:43:35,281 --> 01:43:36,114
I'm a scientist.

3406
01:43:36,270 --> 01:43:37,350
This is what's going on.

3407
01:43:37,351 --> 01:43:40,500
And we have to really accept that in
order to figure out what we're dealing

3408
01:43:40,501 --> 01:43:40,920
with.

3409
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:41,131
Yeah,

3410
01:43:41,131 --> 01:43:41,401
man.

3411
01:43:41,401 --> 01:43:41,970
You know,

3412
01:43:41,970 --> 01:43:43,920
science actually saved me.

3413
01:43:44,010 --> 01:43:45,060
I mean the data,

3414
01:43:45,270 --> 01:43:48,360
the focus on what do the data
say saved my life and you know,

3415
01:43:48,361 --> 01:43:51,120
without science I'm
not here and all I can,

3416
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:54,050
I mean there are people
who are smarter than me.

3417
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:56,240
There are people who are
more articulate than me.

3418
01:43:56,241 --> 01:43:58,520
There are people who are
more wealthy than I am,

3419
01:43:59,060 --> 01:44:02,660
but the great equalizer are the data.

3420
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:07,280
Whatever the data says is the position
that I take and as long as I do that,

3421
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:08,451
I'm okay.

3422
01:44:08,451 --> 01:44:09,284
I can do,

3423
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:11,150
I can say anything publicly,

3424
01:44:11,151 --> 01:44:12,290
I can be in public.

3425
01:44:12,350 --> 01:44:13,183
I don't,

3426
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:17,030
nothing intimidates me as long
as I am on the side of the data.

3427
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:17,871
Yeah,

3428
01:44:17,871 --> 01:44:18,291
that's,

3429
01:44:18,291 --> 01:44:22,400
that is so important and that's
not what's been thrown around.

3430
01:44:22,401 --> 01:44:25,700
It's been what ideology
do you prescribe to what,

3431
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:26,301
you know,

3432
01:44:26,301 --> 01:44:26,521
what,

3433
01:44:26,521 --> 01:44:26,841
what is,

3434
01:44:26,841 --> 01:44:28,550
what are your thoughts on freewill?

3435
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:32,570
What are your thoughts on the person's
ability to handle certain things and

3436
01:44:32,571 --> 01:44:33,141
other people can't?

3437
01:44:33,141 --> 01:44:36,830
That's what the discussion has always
been more almost more philosophical.

3438
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:37,071
Yeah.

3439
01:44:37,071 --> 01:44:40,270
I know as long as discussion
is at that level and,

3440
01:44:40,271 --> 01:44:44,390
and now we can engage in
this exchange of ignorance.

3441
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:45,800
And that's what we've had,

3442
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:46,150
you know.

3443
01:44:46,150 --> 01:44:47,090
So in this case,

3444
01:44:47,091 --> 01:44:47,840
what we,

3445
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:52,250
when I'm trying to do is make sure we
avoid to exchanges of ignorance and making

3446
01:44:52,251 --> 01:44:54,740
sure that people engage
in this conversation,

3447
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:56,570
that they have some expertise,

3448
01:44:56,571 --> 01:44:57,231
some skills,

3449
01:44:57,231 --> 01:44:57,921
some knowledge,

3450
01:44:57,921 --> 01:44:59,750
and not just some emotion.

3451
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:01,580
Now in a perfect world,

3452
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:05,780
would drugs be decriminalized
or would they be legalized?

3453
01:45:06,020 --> 01:45:06,201
Yeah,

3454
01:45:06,201 --> 01:45:07,730
so in high price in the book,

3455
01:45:07,731 --> 01:45:10,370
I argued that all drugs
should be decriminalized.

3456
01:45:10,670 --> 01:45:11,240
Um,

3457
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:14,510
I say they should be decriminalized and
then we should have this corresponding

3458
01:45:14,511 --> 01:45:16,340
increase in realistic education.

3459
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:18,950
Now when things are decriminalized,

3460
01:45:18,951 --> 01:45:21,200
then that means that people can be fined.

3461
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:22,041
That's right.

3462
01:45:22,041 --> 01:45:22,730
They,

3463
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:24,380
they may be subjected to fines.

3464
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:26,500
You don't necessarily have to be fine too,

3465
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:28,190
but just like a traffic violation,

3466
01:45:28,191 --> 01:45:30,560
you might get a fine or
you may not get a fine.

3467
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:31,310
Um,

3468
01:45:31,310 --> 01:45:31,760
but the,

3469
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:34,580
the one thing that's important
here is that they don't,

3470
01:45:34,610 --> 01:45:38,300
they don't go to jail and they don't
ruin their lives as a result of having a

3471
01:45:38,301 --> 01:45:39,320
felony conviction.

3472
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:41,390
Because when we think
about the last three,

3473
01:45:41,391 --> 01:45:43,010
President Barack Obama,

3474
01:45:43,490 --> 01:45:44,420
George Bush,

3475
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:45,260
Bill Clinton,

3476
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:47,600
all three of those guys
used illegal drugs.

3477
01:45:47,890 --> 01:45:48,480
Um,

3478
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:49,313
uh,

3479
01:45:49,370 --> 01:45:49,941
Clinton,

3480
01:45:49,941 --> 01:45:50,691
marijuana,

3481
01:45:50,691 --> 01:45:51,740
Bush marijuana,

3482
01:45:51,770 --> 01:45:53,900
he's widely suspected abusing cocaine.

3483
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:56,240
Obama used marijuana and cocaine.

3484
01:45:56,930 --> 01:46:00,440
All I'm saying is that let's
make sure that the society has,

3485
01:46:00,470 --> 01:46:03,140
everybody in the society
has the same opportunities.

3486
01:46:03,210 --> 01:46:04,190
It's those guys.

3487
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:10,060
Now I'm in a decriminalized situation
as opposed to a legal situation.

3488
01:46:10,550 --> 01:46:14,810
How do we decide where the revenue
comes from as far as like tickets?

3489
01:46:14,930 --> 01:46:16,050
Isn't that an issue when,

3490
01:46:16,070 --> 01:46:17,600
cause then it becomes a money thing again?

3491
01:46:17,660 --> 01:46:17,930
Yeah.

3492
01:46:17,930 --> 01:46:21,860
You can charge people at ticket for having
marijuana marijuana's decriminalized

3493
01:46:21,861 --> 01:46:23,960
and all a sudden we're getting
tickets left and right for weed.

3494
01:46:24,140 --> 01:46:25,280
It's like a speeding thing.

3495
01:46:25,281 --> 01:46:29,090
Like it's like putting a 25 mile an
hour speed limit on the highway when you

3496
01:46:29,091 --> 01:46:30,170
know everyone's going to break it.

3497
01:46:30,350 --> 01:46:31,030
Yes.

3498
01:46:31,030 --> 01:46:31,290
No,

3499
01:46:31,290 --> 01:46:31,500
no,

3500
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:31,760
no.

3501
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,110
That's exactly right.

3502
01:46:33,111 --> 01:46:37,580
And so that's where we have to be smart
as a society in terms of thinking about

3503
01:46:37,581 --> 01:46:41,540
the administrative fees or fines
that we would charge people.

3504
01:46:41,541 --> 01:46:41,811
Well,

3505
01:46:41,811 --> 01:46:45,740
we set limits to make sure
that we don't become excessive.

3506
01:46:46,190 --> 01:46:46,960
For example,

3507
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:47,431
the,

3508
01:46:47,431 --> 01:46:50,310
the greatest amount of
fine you can give someone,

3509
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:55,310
let's just say it's $25 or some amount
that is not prohibitive and an amount

3510
01:46:55,561 --> 01:46:56,490
that they,

3511
01:46:56,520 --> 01:47:00,840
that police departments can't depend
upon for their budgets and that money

3512
01:47:00,841 --> 01:47:04,620
shouldn't be allowed to be
used to support police budgets.

3513
01:47:05,180 --> 01:47:07,010
That's an interesting way of doing it.

3514
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:09,430
Are you completely
opposed to legalization?

3515
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:09,991
No,

3516
01:47:09,991 --> 01:47:10,261
no,

3517
01:47:10,261 --> 01:47:10,561
no.

3518
01:47:10,561 --> 01:47:13,470
I mean I am not completely
opposed to legalization.

3519
01:47:13,471 --> 01:47:15,810
Mind concern here is that uh,

3520
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:19,020
the country were too ignorant
right now for legalization.

3521
01:47:19,021 --> 01:47:22,620
Not that people will go out and do
some dangerous things related to drugs,

3522
01:47:22,621 --> 01:47:24,210
but if you legalize drugs,

3523
01:47:24,211 --> 01:47:29,211
now what will happen is that you will
have the detractors say things like any

3524
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:33,360
ILS in a society has got to be blamed
on a drug and were so ignorant.

3525
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:35,520
We're susceptible to believing that.

3526
01:47:35,521 --> 01:47:37,590
So before legalization,

3527
01:47:37,591 --> 01:47:41,790
I'm arguing that we have this increase
in education about what drugs do and

3528
01:47:41,791 --> 01:47:42,271
don't do,

3529
01:47:42,271 --> 01:47:43,020
do.

3530
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:47,310
So people cannot be susceptible
to being hoodwinked like that.

3531
01:47:47,620 --> 01:47:47,870
Um,

3532
01:47:47,870 --> 01:47:51,210
I'm arguing that the education
provides an inoculation.

3533
01:47:51,211 --> 01:47:52,044
If you will.

3534
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:53,820
So you're saying we
can't handle the truth.

3535
01:47:53,821 --> 01:47:54,271
Essentially,

3536
01:47:54,271 --> 01:47:58,470
where are you saying is that we need
this decriminalization step before we get

3537
01:47:58,471 --> 01:47:59,990
to a legalization that it's,

3538
01:48:00,010 --> 01:48:02,550
that we couldn't just jump
right into legalization.

3539
01:48:02,740 --> 01:48:04,140
It will be too much change.

3540
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:05,190
Pandemonium.

3541
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:06,510
People go crazy.

3542
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:07,433
Fear.

3543
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:10,530
People would use propaganda
to set people against the,

3544
01:48:10,531 --> 01:48:10,831
you know,

3545
01:48:10,831 --> 01:48:11,670
to go against it.

3546
01:48:11,710 --> 01:48:11,981
Yeah.

3547
01:48:11,981 --> 01:48:12,910
So I'm thinking about,

3548
01:48:12,911 --> 01:48:13,720
well I'm,

3549
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:15,640
I'm not saying it will be pandemonium.

3550
01:48:15,850 --> 01:48:18,220
We have Washington and Colorado right now.

3551
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:20,410
Mark my words,

3552
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:25,560
there will be studies coming out of
Washington and Colorado showing that young

3553
01:48:27,311 --> 01:48:32,311
people in those states do more poorly on
whatever measure you want to have as a

3554
01:48:32,471 --> 01:48:33,790
result of marijuana.

3555
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:35,193
The studies,

3556
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:37,510
the data won't support that conclusion,

3557
01:48:37,690 --> 01:48:40,660
but that's what people were going
to be drawing from those data.

3558
01:48:40,990 --> 01:48:41,950
And so I'm,

3559
01:48:42,070 --> 01:48:45,760
this is my prediction right now as
a result of people's ignorance about

3560
01:48:45,761 --> 01:48:46,594
marijuana.

3561
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:47,710
And that's,

3562
01:48:47,710 --> 01:48:48,700
that's marijuana.

3563
01:48:48,701 --> 01:48:53,140
A drug that we have a lot more experienced
and what heroin and but mark my

3564
01:48:53,141 --> 01:48:53,471
words,

3565
01:48:53,471 --> 01:48:54,580
you'll see those studies come out

3566
01:48:54,690 --> 01:48:55,051
now.

3567
01:48:55,051 --> 01:48:59,530
Isn't it problematic that marijuana is
legal in two states medically legal?

3568
01:48:59,531 --> 01:49:00,930
And more like 18 or something now.

3569
01:49:00,931 --> 01:49:02,310
Something crazy at 17 or 18.

3570
01:49:02,311 --> 01:49:02,820
Yeah.

3571
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:05,700
But still a schedule one substance,

3572
01:49:05,701 --> 01:49:08,670
which means that it
has no medicinal value.

3573
01:49:08,970 --> 01:49:10,440
Whereas for folks who don't know,

3574
01:49:10,650 --> 01:49:14,770
heroin and cocaine are
both scheduled to um,

3575
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:16,170
which is kind of silly.

3576
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:21,090
Scheduled one also includes all of the
nonlethal psychedelic variants like

3577
01:49:21,091 --> 01:49:25,350
silicide in which the LD 50 rated
something fucking crazy marijuana.

3578
01:49:25,351 --> 01:49:28,410
It's like 1500 pounds
inside of 15 minutes.

3579
01:49:28,411 --> 01:49:28,800
Like,

3580
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:29,011
yeah.

3581
01:49:29,011 --> 01:49:32,790
So it'd be clear heroin is a schedule
one drug not scheduled to what is,

3582
01:49:32,791 --> 01:49:35,940
what is scheduled to methamphetamine
is scheduled to scheduled to as

3583
01:49:35,941 --> 01:49:36,481
methamphetamine,

3584
01:49:36,481 --> 01:49:39,930
cocaine scheduled to cocaine
scheduled to morphine is scheduled to.

3585
01:49:39,931 --> 01:49:43,120
So how do they get oxycontin's
and then if a schedule to that,

3586
01:49:43,130 --> 01:49:43,891
those are scheduled too.

3587
01:49:43,891 --> 01:49:44,724
But it's heroin.

3588
01:49:45,490 --> 01:49:46,061
Yeah,

3589
01:49:46,061 --> 01:49:47,050
it's an opiate.

3590
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:49,570
They Act at the same brain receptor.

3591
01:49:49,980 --> 01:49:51,490
So your,

3592
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:51,801
your,

3593
01:49:51,801 --> 01:49:52,150
your,

3594
01:49:52,150 --> 01:49:52,720
uh,

3595
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:53,480
your,

3596
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:54,460
your puzzle look,

3597
01:49:54,461 --> 01:49:59,461
just the kind of explains or it
typifies a Americans drug education.

3598
01:50:00,671 --> 01:50:01,060
Could you,

3599
01:50:01,060 --> 01:50:02,080
you were bright when you set,

3600
01:50:02,081 --> 01:50:03,070
but it's heroin.

3601
01:50:03,490 --> 01:50:04,300
Exactly.

3602
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:09,300
But a better analogy is that morphine
and heroin are essentially the same drug.

3603
01:50:09,791 --> 01:50:12,220
Like I explained the difference
between crack and powder.

3604
01:50:12,610 --> 01:50:14,260
That's morphine and heroin.

3605
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:15,393
Well that's why I was,

3606
01:50:15,490 --> 01:50:15,820
I'm sorry.

3607
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:16,100
Yeah.

3608
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:16,960
So morphine,

3609
01:50:16,990 --> 01:50:20,950
heroin is just morphine would
an acid group attached to it?

3610
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:21,820
They're the same drug.

3611
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:24,610
And so the fact that drugs are legal,

3612
01:50:24,611 --> 01:50:27,160
you and I talked about this early,

3613
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:29,530
earlier has less to do with the drugs,

3614
01:50:29,531 --> 01:50:34,240
biological activity of pharmacology and
more to do with the social conditions

3615
01:50:34,990 --> 01:50:36,790
that were surrounding,

3616
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:37,630
um,

3617
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:37,931
uh,

3618
01:50:37,931 --> 01:50:38,461
the,

3619
01:50:38,461 --> 01:50:38,661
the,

3620
01:50:38,661 --> 01:50:41,350
the legality of the drug
more so than pharmacology.

3621
01:50:41,470 --> 01:50:42,161
That's interesting.

3622
01:50:42,161 --> 01:50:42,521
So,

3623
01:50:42,521 --> 01:50:43,240
uh,

3624
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:44,140
cocaine,

3625
01:50:44,141 --> 01:50:49,141
which is a schedule two is crack a
schedule one crack is a schedule one.

3626
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:50,473
Yes.

3627
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:52,391
Oh,

3628
01:50:52,391 --> 01:50:53,290
I get squirrely,

3629
01:50:53,291 --> 01:50:53,870
doesn't it?

3630
01:50:53,870 --> 01:50:54,400
That's right.

3631
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:57,400
That's very squarely so heroin,

3632
01:50:57,401 --> 01:50:57,971
crack,

3633
01:50:57,971 --> 01:50:58,804
bad.

3634
01:50:59,140 --> 01:51:02,110
Oxycotton and you know,

3635
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:03,190
all the other variance.

3636
01:51:03,470 --> 01:51:03,810
Yeah.

3637
01:51:03,810 --> 01:51:04,180
Okay.

3638
01:51:04,180 --> 01:51:05,620
The thing people have to understand that,

3639
01:51:05,621 --> 01:51:08,740
that these schedules are
largely based on politics.

3640
01:51:08,770 --> 01:51:11,860
There are more political
than pharmacology.

3641
01:51:11,861 --> 01:51:12,694
I'll do,

3642
01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:16,600
we say that they're largely
based on pharmacology,

3643
01:51:16,601 --> 01:51:17,530
but some of this stuff,

3644
01:51:17,531 --> 01:51:18,490
as you're pointing out,

3645
01:51:18,491 --> 01:51:21,910
the inconsistencies in our logic
and you don't even study this,

3646
01:51:21,911 --> 01:51:25,630
you just are just pointing this out and
you can see the flaws in our thinking

3647
01:51:25,631 --> 01:51:26,890
and you're absolutely right.

3648
01:51:26,891 --> 01:51:31,310
So the scheduling thing
is largely sociopolitical.

3649
01:51:31,311 --> 01:51:31,410
Yeah.

3650
01:51:31,410 --> 01:51:32,190
Cultural.

3651
01:51:32,190 --> 01:51:33,120
That's fascinating.

3652
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:37,020
I had always assumed that heroin was
scheduled to just because I knew that

3653
01:51:37,021 --> 01:51:38,850
oxycontin's were prescribed.

3654
01:51:38,851 --> 01:51:39,480
I didn't know.

3655
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:41,730
And then the crack that the
whole thing totally makes sense.

3656
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,270
What is the additional,

3657
01:51:43,290 --> 01:51:44,910
the medicinal use of cocaine?

3658
01:51:44,930 --> 01:51:46,440
Cause there's medicinal cocaine.

3659
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:47,500
Yeah.

3660
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:48,071
Think about it.

3661
01:51:48,071 --> 01:51:49,750
If you've ever gone to a dentist,

3662
01:51:49,751 --> 01:51:50,021
right?

3663
01:51:50,021 --> 01:51:53,680
You might've had novacane put
on your gums without cocaine.

3664
01:51:53,681 --> 01:51:56,950
You don't have novacane because
cocaine was the first local anesthetic,

3665
01:51:56,980 --> 01:51:57,670
right?

3666
01:51:57,670 --> 01:51:58,503
That's one.

3667
01:51:58,690 --> 01:51:59,710
But cocaine today,

3668
01:51:59,711 --> 01:52:04,711
it's used primarily in minor surgeries
in order to restrict the blood flow so

3669
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:07,660
people can operate in that environment.

3670
01:52:07,690 --> 01:52:08,800
That's what it's mainly,

3671
01:52:08,801 --> 01:52:08,900
yeah.

3672
01:52:08,900 --> 01:52:09,733
Useful.

3673
01:52:09,830 --> 01:52:12,860
So a Lidocaine also related to cocaine.

3674
01:52:13,010 --> 01:52:14,450
Cocaine is related to cocaine.

3675
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:14,960
That's right.

3676
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:17,030
I had my nose fixed and they uh,

3677
01:52:17,060 --> 01:52:19,160
through some lidocaine up there and they,

3678
01:52:19,161 --> 01:52:19,401
you know,

3679
01:52:19,401 --> 01:52:22,790
they had the packing up there and then
they spray lie to cane and I was fucked

3680
01:52:22,791 --> 01:52:23,571
up all day,

3681
01:52:23,571 --> 01:52:23,931
man.

3682
01:52:23,931 --> 01:52:25,610
I mean it was a weird feeling.

3683
01:52:25,611 --> 01:52:26,930
Like I wasn't high,

3684
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:27,351
you know,

3685
01:52:27,351 --> 01:52:28,550
it wasn't like a cocaine high,

3686
01:52:28,551 --> 01:52:28,970
but I was like,

3687
01:52:28,970 --> 01:52:29,241
wow,

3688
01:52:29,241 --> 01:52:30,140
I don't feel good.

3689
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:32,180
And I knew it was that line of Cain Shit.

3690
01:52:32,181 --> 01:52:32,451
I was like,

3691
01:52:32,451 --> 01:52:32,681
I,

3692
01:52:32,681 --> 01:52:37,250
I think I would rather have just felt
the pain and to have all this weird stuff

3693
01:52:37,251 --> 01:52:37,971
in my system,

3694
01:52:37,971 --> 01:52:38,804
you know?

3695
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:39,341
Yeah.

3696
01:52:39,341 --> 01:52:39,830
But yeah,

3697
01:52:39,830 --> 01:52:40,390
without,

3698
01:52:40,390 --> 01:52:43,890
without cocaine you don't have the local
anesthetic properties apply to came

3699
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:45,130
because it's a modification,

3700
01:52:45,230 --> 01:52:46,070
the cocaine structure.

3701
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:46,820
Now,

3702
01:52:46,820 --> 01:52:51,820
how difficult would it be to get these
drugs that have these insane LD 50 rates

3703
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:57,430
and have a wealth of met
medicinal benefits like
marijuana and get them out of

3704
01:52:57,431 --> 01:52:58,264
schedule one?

3705
01:52:58,610 --> 01:52:59,510
I think marijuana,

3706
01:52:59,511 --> 01:53:03,260
there was a lot of movement
now for marijuana to be
moved away from schedule one

3707
01:53:03,261 --> 01:53:04,160
to schedule two.

3708
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:05,360
Um,

3709
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:05,940
I think if,

3710
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:07,310
if the public continues,

3711
01:53:07,311 --> 01:53:08,144
it's pressure,

3712
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:09,440
I think it will happen.

3713
01:53:09,441 --> 01:53:13,310
But the public has to be vigilant
and they have to continue.

3714
01:53:13,311 --> 01:53:15,440
It's a activity and intensity,

3715
01:53:15,740 --> 01:53:16,700
otherwise they won't be,

3716
01:53:17,140 --> 01:53:17,973
it won't happen,

3717
01:53:18,110 --> 01:53:18,411
you know,

3718
01:53:18,411 --> 01:53:18,711
like,

3719
01:53:18,711 --> 01:53:19,370
um,

3720
01:53:19,370 --> 01:53:24,370
we sometimes think that these things
are based mainly on medicine and medical

3721
01:53:24,591 --> 01:53:25,161
community,

3722
01:53:25,161 --> 01:53:26,270
scientific community.

3723
01:53:26,630 --> 01:53:28,520
The public has an important
role to play here.

3724
01:53:28,820 --> 01:53:29,530
So

3725
01:53:29,530 --> 01:53:31,030
public opinion and public,

3726
01:53:31,190 --> 01:53:31,420
the,

3727
01:53:31,420 --> 01:53:31,770
the,

3728
01:53:31,770 --> 01:53:32,030
the,

3729
01:53:32,030 --> 01:53:32,801
the tide,

3730
01:53:32,801 --> 01:53:34,660
which way the tide is
going is very important.

3731
01:53:34,661 --> 01:53:35,410
Yes.

3732
01:53:35,410 --> 01:53:35,921
Now when,

3733
01:53:35,921 --> 01:53:37,390
when you have something like,

3734
01:53:37,450 --> 01:53:37,950
uh,

3735
01:53:37,950 --> 01:53:38,260
like,

3736
01:53:38,260 --> 01:53:40,690
like marijuana that doesn't hurt people,

3737
01:53:40,691 --> 01:53:41,860
that doesn't kill people.

3738
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:44,440
And then you hear like you'll hear on TV,

3739
01:53:44,441 --> 01:53:47,500
people come on and start talking
about withdrawal symptoms and,

3740
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:50,410
and people that have
withdrawals from marijuana.

3741
01:53:50,950 --> 01:53:53,050
Are there physical
withdrawals from marijuana?

3742
01:53:53,051 --> 01:53:53,884
Is it possible?

3743
01:53:54,290 --> 01:53:54,501
Yeah,

3744
01:53:54,501 --> 01:53:58,630
I think I'd published maybe
along with my colleagues,

3745
01:53:59,150 --> 01:54:02,300
maybe 10 papers on marijuana withdrawal.

3746
01:54:02,710 --> 01:54:06,830
And so we have actually shown
a demonstrated marijuana
withdrawal now I should

3747
01:54:06,831 --> 01:54:07,664
say,

3748
01:54:08,030 --> 01:54:09,890
in order to see marijuana withdrawal,

3749
01:54:09,891 --> 01:54:12,830
you have to have people who
smoked a drug every day,

3750
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:17,330
damn near every day and multiple joints
per day and then you are abruptly

3751
01:54:17,331 --> 01:54:18,164
stopped them.

3752
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:20,750
Now you don't see marijuana
withdrawal than everyone,

3753
01:54:20,780 --> 01:54:23,570
but you certainly can see some
marijuana withdrawal to some people.

3754
01:54:23,870 --> 01:54:25,550
And when I say marijuana withdrawal,

3755
01:54:25,970 --> 01:54:28,220
it's about like nicotine withdrawal.

3756
01:54:28,310 --> 01:54:28,641
You know,

3757
01:54:28,641 --> 01:54:29,474
people,

3758
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:29,901
uh,

3759
01:54:29,901 --> 01:54:31,460
they have sleep disruptions,

3760
01:54:31,461 --> 01:54:33,050
they have eating disruptions,

3761
01:54:33,051 --> 01:54:35,330
they are more moody,

3762
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:37,790
these are more psychological
sort of issues.

3763
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:38,570
Um,

3764
01:54:38,570 --> 01:54:39,403
certainly not,

3765
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:40,730
not life threatening.

3766
01:54:41,090 --> 01:54:41,540
Um,

3767
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:41,991
but,

3768
01:54:41,991 --> 01:54:42,260
uh,

3769
01:54:42,260 --> 01:54:43,130
it's unpleasant.

3770
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:43,550
You know,

3771
01:54:43,550 --> 01:54:47,090
if you can think about having
withdrawal from tobacco,

3772
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:48,620
you probably have a,

3773
01:54:48,621 --> 01:54:50,690
you have a good idea of
marijuana withdrawal.

3774
01:54:50,790 --> 01:54:53,640
So it would be as strong as tobacco Raul,

3775
01:54:53,730 --> 01:54:55,800
because tobacco withdrawals a huge one.

3776
01:54:55,801 --> 01:54:56,710
Like oftentimes it's,

3777
01:54:56,810 --> 01:54:59,280
it's connected to being as bad as,

3778
01:54:59,490 --> 01:55:00,323
as heroin.

3779
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:01,673
Well that's,

3780
01:55:02,070 --> 01:55:03,270
that's an exaggeration.

3781
01:55:03,271 --> 01:55:03,720
Yeah.

3782
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:05,620
Goddamn cigarette smokers pictures.

3783
01:55:06,110 --> 01:55:06,351
Yeah,

3784
01:55:06,351 --> 01:55:07,520
that's an exaggeration.

3785
01:55:07,521 --> 01:55:09,440
And now when we think about,

3786
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:10,071
again,

3787
01:55:10,071 --> 01:55:11,330
when I want to emphasize,

3788
01:55:11,331 --> 01:55:12,920
when we think about marijuana withdraw,

3789
01:55:13,130 --> 01:55:18,130
it's only seen in the heaviest users and
is not seen and even all of the heavy

3790
01:55:19,011 --> 01:55:19,670
users.

3791
01:55:19,670 --> 01:55:23,300
And so it's something that
you certainly can observe,

3792
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:25,010
but it's not common.

3793
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:26,533
And

3794
01:55:26,570 --> 01:55:30,710
so when you talk about these absolutely
extreme versions of people that are

3795
01:55:30,711 --> 01:55:32,420
smoking multiple joints a day every day,

3796
01:55:32,421 --> 01:55:33,650
and then they stopped abruptly,

3797
01:55:33,950 --> 01:55:35,510
then they just feel like
shit for a little while.

3798
01:55:35,511 --> 01:55:35,930
That's it.

3799
01:55:35,930 --> 01:55:36,710
That's all right.

3800
01:55:36,710 --> 01:55:37,250
That's it.

3801
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:37,611
That's all right.

3802
01:55:37,611 --> 01:55:38,444
No danger.

3803
01:55:38,660 --> 01:55:38,991
No,

3804
01:55:38,991 --> 01:55:39,780
I mean your,

3805
01:55:39,780 --> 01:55:40,040
your,

3806
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:40,851
you'll be fine.

3807
01:55:40,851 --> 01:55:41,121
There wasn't,

3808
01:55:41,121 --> 01:55:43,980
you're not in any physical
danger is part of it your

3809
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:47,520
brain just scrambling because all of a
sudden it's not high anymore and you're

3810
01:55:47,521 --> 01:55:47,701
like,

3811
01:55:47,701 --> 01:55:48,450
what are we doing?

3812
01:55:48,450 --> 01:55:49,770
What the fuck is going on here?

3813
01:55:49,790 --> 01:55:51,900
Like maybe that's the
better way to put it.

3814
01:55:51,901 --> 01:55:52,201
You know,

3815
01:55:52,201 --> 01:55:54,780
I was just trying to think of
some scientific way of saying,

3816
01:55:54,781 --> 01:55:58,140
but I think that that might be
a better way of just saying,

3817
01:55:58,141 --> 01:55:58,610
you know,

3818
01:55:58,610 --> 01:55:59,230
um,

3819
01:55:59,230 --> 01:56:00,780
well think about it this way.

3820
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:05,370
Whenever you engage in some activity
heavily for some extended period of time

3821
01:56:05,490 --> 01:56:06,930
and then you abruptly stopped,

3822
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:07,890
you know,

3823
01:56:07,890 --> 01:56:08,641
your body,

3824
01:56:08,641 --> 01:56:11,100
particularly when you think
take in some substance,

3825
01:56:11,101 --> 01:56:15,540
your body adjusts to that substance
being there and now that substance is

3826
01:56:15,541 --> 01:56:19,980
abruptly removed and now all
the compensatory mechanisms
in your body and your

3827
01:56:19,981 --> 01:56:21,840
brain are overactive.

3828
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:25,710
And so that's part of the reason that
you have the withdrawal symptoms.

3829
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:30,420
But eventually the body resets
and goes back to his homeostasis.

3830
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:34,680
It's normal sort of balance except an
extreme examples like alcohol where your

3831
01:56:34,681 --> 01:56:35,730
body desire,

3832
01:56:35,731 --> 01:56:36,480
you have to,

3833
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:39,390
you have to do something to gap alcohol.

3834
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:40,553
It's too dry,

3835
01:56:41,010 --> 01:56:42,000
too traumatic.

3836
01:56:42,001 --> 01:56:42,271
I mean,

3837
01:56:42,271 --> 01:56:43,590
wha when marijuana,

3838
01:56:43,591 --> 01:56:47,700
one of the nice things about marijuana
is that it stays in the body relatively

3839
01:56:47,701 --> 01:56:48,420
long.

3840
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:51,480
So to halflife of marijuana
can be as much as 24 hours.

3841
01:56:52,050 --> 01:56:52,883
Now that's,

3842
01:56:53,010 --> 01:56:56,190
that allows the body to slowly detoxify.

3843
01:56:56,430 --> 01:56:57,750
Whereas what alcohol,

3844
01:56:57,960 --> 01:57:01,340
it's gone within an hour and
it's like this abrupt shutoff,

3845
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:02,390
you're shut off.

3846
01:57:02,430 --> 01:57:07,430
And now all of these compensatory Mekesen
mechanisms are hyperactive and uh,

3847
01:57:08,130 --> 01:57:10,170
whereas what marijuana,

3848
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:13,020
these compensatory mechanisms are active,

3849
01:57:13,230 --> 01:57:16,050
but they have an opportunity
to slowly adjust.

3850
01:57:16,470 --> 01:57:17,880
That's fascinating.

3851
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:19,110
So that's such a,

3852
01:57:19,111 --> 01:57:21,270
that's such a unique piece of information,

3853
01:57:21,290 --> 01:57:21,990
uh,

3854
01:57:21,990 --> 01:57:26,370
that the hangover effect is a
withdraw from alcohol effect.

3855
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:26,760
Yup.

3856
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:28,920
I had always thought that
it was just dehydration,

3857
01:57:29,250 --> 01:57:30,150
but I always wonder like,

3858
01:57:30,151 --> 01:57:31,740
why is it so strong?

3859
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:34,730
Like you got to get really fucking
dehydrated to get the kind of feeling that

3860
01:57:34,731 --> 01:57:35,850
you get when you have a hangover.

3861
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:36,330
Yep.

3862
01:57:36,330 --> 01:57:36,961
Particularly,

3863
01:57:36,961 --> 01:57:37,331
you know,

3864
01:57:37,331 --> 01:57:37,921
and just think about it,

3865
01:57:37,921 --> 01:57:40,050
you put a in all this
alcohol in your system,

3866
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:41,520
people who have hangovers,

3867
01:57:41,550 --> 01:57:42,420
all this alcohol,

3868
01:57:42,421 --> 01:57:43,254
and as you get older,

3869
01:57:43,620 --> 01:57:45,460
you don't need a pump
that much in department,

3870
01:57:45,480 --> 01:57:46,860
all of this alcohol in your system.

3871
01:57:46,861 --> 01:57:48,180
Then all of a sudden it's gone.

3872
01:57:48,210 --> 01:57:48,840
It stopped.

3873
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:52,080
And then your body was just
adjusting to the drug being there.

3874
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:55,200
So compensatory mechanisms are really,

3875
01:57:55,201 --> 01:57:55,920
that's the,

3876
01:57:55,920 --> 01:58:00,120
that's the mechanisms behind the
addiction that you're trying to,

3877
01:58:00,180 --> 01:58:04,170
when he introduced the drug to keep
those compensatory mechanisms satisfied.

3878
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:05,400
No.

3879
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:06,010
Let me try it.

3880
01:58:06,010 --> 01:58:06,380
Let me,

3881
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:07,430
how can I think of it?

3882
01:58:07,620 --> 01:58:07,931
Like I say,

3883
01:58:07,931 --> 01:58:08,820
if this thing about heroin,

3884
01:58:08,821 --> 01:58:10,020
that's an easier one for me.

3885
01:58:10,350 --> 01:58:11,430
We think about heroin.

3886
01:58:11,700 --> 01:58:13,650
One of the things the
heroin is really good at,

3887
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:16,080
and it's used medically for this reason,

3888
01:58:16,081 --> 01:58:19,890
it had been used medically for this
reason is that it stops diarrhea.

3889
01:58:19,891 --> 01:58:23,970
So people who have a diarrhea
that can cause death,

3890
01:58:23,971 --> 01:58:24,661
for example,

3891
01:58:24,661 --> 01:58:25,740
you give them heroin,

3892
01:58:25,980 --> 01:58:27,570
it makes you constipated.

3893
01:58:27,930 --> 01:58:29,880
That's a compensatory mechanism,

3894
01:58:30,110 --> 01:58:30,450
uh,

3895
01:58:30,450 --> 01:58:31,283
of,

3896
01:58:31,470 --> 01:58:31,670
of,

3897
01:58:31,670 --> 01:58:32,371
of heroin,

3898
01:58:32,371 --> 01:58:32,671
right?

3899
01:58:32,671 --> 01:58:32,981
So,

3900
01:58:32,981 --> 01:58:33,071
uh,

3901
01:58:33,071 --> 01:58:33,490
that's a,

3902
01:58:33,490 --> 01:58:36,550
that's a compensatory mechanism
of the body having it.

3903
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:37,340
What,

3904
01:58:37,340 --> 01:58:37,710
I'm sorry,

3905
01:58:37,710 --> 01:58:42,250
compensatory mechanism of the body
is that it tries to counteract

3906
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:43,380
the sort of,

3907
01:58:43,381 --> 01:58:43,720
uh,

3908
01:58:43,720 --> 01:58:44,470
um,

3909
01:58:44,470 --> 01:58:46,480
constipation that heroin causes.

3910
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:50,020
So it has to get the juices flowing again,

3911
01:58:50,021 --> 01:58:50,620
if you would.

3912
01:58:50,620 --> 01:58:55,300
The body tries to do that when
the heroine abruptly leaves.

3913
01:58:55,540 --> 01:59:00,540
These overactive mechanisms now causes
someone to have diarrhea because it was

3914
01:59:00,821 --> 01:59:02,410
trying to get the system going.

3915
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:04,960
So the body is just trying to,

3916
01:59:04,961 --> 01:59:09,400
could correct itself to be where you
need to be because you need to go to the

3917
01:59:09,401 --> 01:59:13,360
bathroom and the body is trying to make
sure that happens because heroin is

3918
01:59:13,361 --> 01:59:15,160
blocking that ability to do that.

3919
01:59:15,650 --> 01:59:16,390
So that's

3920
01:59:16,390 --> 01:59:17,650
absolutely fascinating.

3921
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:18,071
Now,

3922
01:59:18,071 --> 01:59:20,890
when you do heroin for
long periods of time,

3923
01:59:20,891 --> 01:59:25,891
like how long does it take for these
compensatory mechanisms to really set into

3924
01:59:26,140 --> 01:59:28,120
the point where you hit
it withdrawal syndrome,

3925
01:59:28,970 --> 01:59:29,690
um,

3926
01:59:29,690 --> 01:59:30,381
for heroin,

3927
01:59:30,381 --> 01:59:31,214
for heroin,

3928
01:59:31,340 --> 01:59:32,173
um,

3929
01:59:32,780 --> 01:59:33,620
it all depends.

3930
01:59:33,621 --> 01:59:38,621
So like if you only are using the drug
in the mid intermediate meant Hudley uh,

3931
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:44,210
you don't have to worry about the body
becoming the compensatory mechanism

3932
01:59:44,211 --> 01:59:47,390
becoming so active that you have
to worry about withdrawal symptoms.

3933
01:59:47,750 --> 01:59:50,510
It's only when it's the constant sort of,

3934
01:59:51,210 --> 01:59:51,890
uh,

3935
01:59:51,890 --> 01:59:53,960
administration of the drug constant,

3936
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:55,033
uh,

3937
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:59,150
levels of the drug in the body that
the body compensatory mechanism become

3938
01:59:59,151 --> 01:59:59,984
hyperactive.

3939
02:00:00,230 --> 02:00:01,760
Is that the case with cigarettes as well?

3940
02:00:01,761 --> 02:00:05,900
Because you ever see that movie the
insider with Russell Crowe where I did,

3941
02:00:05,901 --> 02:00:06,401
it was funny.

3942
02:00:06,401 --> 02:00:07,190
It was a calm,

3943
02:00:07,190 --> 02:00:07,380
no,

3944
02:00:07,380 --> 02:00:07,530
no,

3945
02:00:07,530 --> 02:00:07,690
no,

3946
02:00:07,690 --> 02:00:08,050
no,

3947
02:00:08,050 --> 02:00:08,830
no,

3948
02:00:08,830 --> 02:00:08,991
no,

3949
02:00:08,991 --> 02:00:09,171
no,

3950
02:00:09,171 --> 02:00:09,440
no.

3951
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:10,780
The guy worked at a cigarette company,

3952
02:00:10,781 --> 02:00:10,951
you know,

3953
02:00:10,951 --> 02:00:11,860
scientists know,

3954
02:00:11,870 --> 02:00:13,610
I know it's when you're
talking about it was one,

3955
02:00:13,611 --> 02:00:14,360
they did a,

3956
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:17,060
it was based on the 60 minute
interviews and that sort of thing.

3957
02:00:17,061 --> 02:00:17,301
Right?

3958
02:00:17,301 --> 02:00:18,250
The 60 minutes then.

3959
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:19,040
Yes,

3960
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:19,251
yes,

3961
02:00:19,251 --> 02:00:20,060
yes,

3962
02:00:20,060 --> 02:00:20,420
yes.

3963
02:00:20,420 --> 02:00:25,160
It was all the guy who was talking about
the 500 plus different chemicals that

3964
02:00:25,161 --> 02:00:25,994
the uh,

3965
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:29,330
the government allows them
to put in cigarettes that
are all directly related to

3966
02:00:29,530 --> 02:00:30,210
addictive.

3967
02:00:30,210 --> 02:00:30,520
Yeah.

3968
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:31,020
I mean,

3969
02:00:31,020 --> 02:00:33,980
well tobacco has about
4,000 chemicals in it.

3970
02:00:34,010 --> 02:00:34,521
Jesus.

3971
02:00:34,521 --> 02:00:35,354
Yeah.

3972
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:36,260
Um,

3973
02:00:36,260 --> 02:00:39,140
well to natural tobacco
or natural tobacco.

3974
02:00:39,160 --> 02:00:39,420
Okay,

3975
02:00:39,420 --> 02:00:40,310
so natural tobacco,

3976
02:00:40,311 --> 02:00:41,780
it's 4,000 natural chemicals.

3977
02:00:41,781 --> 02:00:42,470
About 4,000.

3978
02:00:42,470 --> 02:00:42,830
Yeah.

3979
02:00:42,830 --> 02:00:44,510
The additional chemicals that the,

3980
02:00:44,511 --> 02:00:45,080
uh,

3981
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:46,250
cigarette companies put in,

3982
02:00:46,251 --> 02:00:48,580
which is what this scientist
was highlighting the,

3983
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:50,030
the guy who Russell Crowe played.

3984
02:00:50,390 --> 02:00:51,040
Um,

3985
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:51,320
what,

3986
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:52,310
what's going on there?

3987
02:00:52,340 --> 02:00:53,720
Like how were they able to do that?

3988
02:00:53,721 --> 02:00:55,180
Like when they're,

3989
02:00:55,181 --> 02:00:59,540
they're adding these things to cigarettes
that make it so that you become more

3990
02:00:59,541 --> 02:01:00,560
addicted more quickly.

3991
02:01:00,770 --> 02:01:01,640
How are they doing that?

3992
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:02,593
What are they doing?

3993
02:01:02,810 --> 02:01:03,331
You know,

3994
02:01:03,331 --> 02:01:04,770
there have been so much said,

3995
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:05,731
for example,

3996
02:01:05,731 --> 02:01:08,880
there are co co chemicals that I
understand that they were trying to add to

3997
02:01:08,881 --> 02:01:13,881
tobacco to make it more readily bleed
released two more readily released a

3998
02:01:14,671 --> 02:01:15,420
nicotine.

3999
02:01:15,420 --> 02:01:16,140
Um,

4000
02:01:16,140 --> 02:01:16,610
um,

4001
02:01:16,610 --> 02:01:16,920
uh,

4002
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:17,280
there,

4003
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:17,670
uh,

4004
02:01:17,670 --> 02:01:20,700
there are chemicals being added
to the back of for flavoring.

4005
02:01:20,701 --> 02:01:21,520
They say,

4006
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:22,170
um,

4007
02:01:22,170 --> 02:01:23,820
there are a variety of sort of things.

4008
02:01:23,821 --> 02:01:24,510
Um,

4009
02:01:24,510 --> 02:01:29,510
but I don't know exactly what
you're getting at it in terms of um,

4010
02:01:31,070 --> 02:01:31,890
uh,

4011
02:01:31,890 --> 02:01:33,500
why they add the,

4012
02:01:33,980 --> 02:01:36,260
the compounds in terms
of addicting people.

4013
02:01:36,350 --> 02:01:36,501
Well,

4014
02:01:36,501 --> 02:01:38,930
this is just from what
I got from that movie.

4015
02:01:39,050 --> 02:01:44,050
The movie Russell Crowe
plays this scientist who's
testifying about how they had

4016
02:01:44,331 --> 02:01:46,480
designed cigarettes to be much more Dick.

4017
02:01:47,070 --> 02:01:47,580
Yeah.

4018
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:47,970
Uh,

4019
02:01:47,970 --> 02:01:50,640
so one of the things that,

4020
02:01:50,641 --> 02:01:55,641
I think it was illegal to manipulate
the nicotine content in the tobacco

4021
02:01:55,741 --> 02:02:00,600
cigarettes because the tobacco company
said that tobacco is a natural product,

4022
02:02:00,630 --> 02:02:01,021
you know,

4023
02:02:01,021 --> 02:02:02,910
so they don't do any manipulations.

4024
02:02:02,911 --> 02:02:03,870
That was one of the things,

4025
02:02:03,871 --> 02:02:06,000
but then it was found out that they had,

4026
02:02:06,540 --> 02:02:07,960
they had been growing,

4027
02:02:07,961 --> 02:02:11,220
does high ta dis high nicotine strain,

4028
02:02:11,550 --> 02:02:14,160
a tobacco and somewhere in South America.

4029
02:02:14,161 --> 02:02:16,950
And so that was one of
those sort of issues,

4030
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:17,580
uh,

4031
02:02:17,580 --> 02:02:18,480
related to this.

4032
02:02:18,510 --> 02:02:19,320
Um,

4033
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:24,270
the tobacco company understands
pharmacology or they
understood pharmacology in

4034
02:02:24,271 --> 02:02:25,770
terms of designing the cigarette.

4035
02:02:26,190 --> 02:02:27,150
And the goal,

4036
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:32,240
one of the major goals is that if you
want to get someone addicted to a drug

4037
02:02:32,580 --> 02:02:34,380
like tobacco or nicotine,

4038
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:37,820
is that you want to make sure you
can release the nicotine in a more,

4039
02:02:37,830 --> 02:02:38,551
in a rapid,

4040
02:02:38,551 --> 02:02:41,010
efficient way to hit the
long until the brain.

4041
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:46,400
And I think the argument was that tobacco
had figured out how to release the

4042
02:02:47,011 --> 02:02:48,930
nicotine more rapidly.

4043
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:49,480
Um,

4044
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:54,460
and then one of the major theories in
addiction work is that the more rapidly a

4045
02:02:54,461 --> 02:02:55,500
drug has the brain,

4046
02:02:55,590 --> 02:02:57,270
the more addicted the drug is.

4047
02:02:57,720 --> 02:03:02,250
And so I don't know of if all
of that has been demonstrated,

4048
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:04,770
but I know a lot of this has been said,

4049
02:03:04,771 --> 02:03:07,170
but I don't know what has
actually been demonstrated,

4050
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:07,950
um,

4051
02:03:07,950 --> 02:03:10,350
in terms of what's a tobacco
company did and what,

4052
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:10,910
what,

4053
02:03:10,910 --> 02:03:11,270
what,

4054
02:03:11,270 --> 02:03:11,700
uh,

4055
02:03:11,700 --> 02:03:12,600
scientists say

4056
02:03:13,010 --> 02:03:13,440
what?

4057
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:14,090
So it's,

4058
02:03:14,090 --> 02:03:18,530
it's all in dose and frequency and that's
how the compensatory mechanisms get

4059
02:03:18,531 --> 02:03:19,364
set off.

4060
02:03:19,550 --> 02:03:21,890
And so even heroin,

4061
02:03:21,891 --> 02:03:24,590
which we've all thought that
you can't do once you'll,

4062
02:03:24,591 --> 02:03:25,191
you'll go,

4063
02:03:25,191 --> 02:03:25,611
man,

4064
02:03:25,611 --> 02:03:26,444
they'll get you.

4065
02:03:26,570 --> 02:03:29,000
You can and you could
probably do it twice,

4066
02:03:29,330 --> 02:03:30,740
but you can't do it every week.

4067
02:03:31,070 --> 02:03:31,331
Yeah,

4068
02:03:31,331 --> 02:03:31,580
man,

4069
02:03:31,580 --> 02:03:33,050
do it like everyday for a couple weeks.

4070
02:03:33,230 --> 02:03:36,620
If anybody out there have taken Vicodin,

4071
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:37,873
Percocet,

4072
02:03:38,060 --> 02:03:38,900
Oxycontin,

4073
02:03:39,470 --> 02:03:40,490
all of those drugs.

4074
02:03:40,491 --> 02:03:43,250
You've taken those drugs
for pain or whatever reason,

4075
02:03:43,580 --> 02:03:44,361
and then you,

4076
02:03:44,361 --> 02:03:47,240
your pain is over and you go back
to your life and you do your thing.

4077
02:03:47,690 --> 02:03:50,180
You have essentially taken
a low dose of heroin.

4078
02:03:50,810 --> 02:03:55,810
And so the notion that someone can't take
heroin more than once without becoming

4079
02:03:56,121 --> 02:03:56,954
addicted.

4080
02:03:57,620 --> 02:03:58,700
That's just Voodoo.

4081
02:03:58,701 --> 02:03:59,451
That's silly.

4082
02:03:59,451 --> 02:04:01,490
That's 1937

4083
02:04:01,610 --> 02:04:06,610
but what about people that do take pills
and I have a relative and he hurt his

4084
02:04:06,921 --> 02:04:07,530
back.

4085
02:04:07,530 --> 02:04:08,630
He was a construction worker,

4086
02:04:08,660 --> 02:04:09,321
hurt his back,

4087
02:04:09,321 --> 02:04:11,780
started taking pain pills
and became fucking a dunk.

4088
02:04:11,810 --> 02:04:12,643
A total junky.

4089
02:04:12,650 --> 02:04:12,920
Yeah,

4090
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:14,030
he was responsible.

4091
02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:15,920
You had a family got divorced.

4092
02:04:15,950 --> 02:04:18,920
One of being this crazy
liar pill popper dude.

4093
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:20,053
Like what's that?

4094
02:04:20,390 --> 02:04:21,223
Yeah.

4095
02:04:21,480 --> 02:04:23,780
Those are the toughest
questions that people ask me.

4096
02:04:23,781 --> 02:04:23,991
Right?

4097
02:04:23,991 --> 02:04:26,720
Because on the one hand
it's like it's not the drug.

4098
02:04:26,721 --> 02:04:27,530
I show you that.

4099
02:04:27,530 --> 02:04:30,350
So when you talk about him becoming a
liar and becoming all these kinds of

4100
02:04:30,351 --> 02:04:30,620
things,

4101
02:04:30,620 --> 02:04:31,580
I don't know the guy,

4102
02:04:31,970 --> 02:04:36,970
but the fact is is that we know that
people do become dependent on these drugs

4103
02:04:38,131 --> 02:04:39,210
for whatever reason.

4104
02:04:39,240 --> 02:04:42,330
I don't know whatever
the reason was for him,

4105
02:04:42,630 --> 02:04:44,340
but there could be a variety of reasons.

4106
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:47,670
A lot of times people become addicted
on these drugs because they have car

4107
02:04:47,671 --> 02:04:48,504
occurring,

4108
02:04:48,510 --> 02:04:53,510
co-occurring psychiatric disorders
because they have lack of other op better

4109
02:04:53,761 --> 02:04:56,940
options because they have
other issues that's going on.

4110
02:04:56,970 --> 02:04:57,541
I don't know,

4111
02:04:57,541 --> 02:04:58,410
but I have to like,

4112
02:04:58,570 --> 02:04:58,930
uh,

4113
02:04:58,930 --> 02:05:01,890
understand disguise complete situation.

4114
02:05:02,300 --> 02:05:02,820
Um,

4115
02:05:02,820 --> 02:05:04,950
but it's a fact that
people do become addicted.

4116
02:05:04,951 --> 02:05:05,461
Some people,

4117
02:05:05,461 --> 02:05:06,810
but the vast majority don't.

4118
02:05:06,811 --> 02:05:08,160
So we can't blame the drug.

4119
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:12,180
What we need to do is more systematically
understand what's going on with that

4120
02:05:12,181 --> 02:05:14,730
person and then we can
figure out what's going on.

4121
02:05:14,900 --> 02:05:15,171
Yeah.

4122
02:05:15,171 --> 02:05:16,640
That's so important when you just said,

4123
02:05:16,641 --> 02:05:17,810
because it's always a,

4124
02:05:17,870 --> 02:05:18,051
I mean,

4125
02:05:18,051 --> 02:05:18,771
what I just did,

4126
02:05:18,771 --> 02:05:20,960
I gave you this anecdotal
story about this guy.

4127
02:05:20,961 --> 02:05:21,141
Well,

4128
02:05:21,141 --> 02:05:23,330
I know a guy ruined his life and then,

4129
02:05:23,331 --> 02:05:23,570
you know,

4130
02:05:23,570 --> 02:05:24,200
well,

4131
02:05:24,200 --> 02:05:27,590
maybe it would've ruined his life anyway
and he would have you use a fucking

4132
02:05:27,591 --> 02:05:28,010
idiot.

4133
02:05:28,010 --> 02:05:29,570
I know the guy just so you're dead,

4134
02:05:29,571 --> 02:05:30,110
right?

4135
02:05:30,110 --> 02:05:30,670
Yeah.

4136
02:05:30,670 --> 02:05:32,030
Your observation is correct.

4137
02:05:32,390 --> 02:05:35,060
He was always looking for
an excuse his whole life.

4138
02:05:35,090 --> 02:05:35,421
You know,

4139
02:05:35,421 --> 02:05:36,710
if you had to run seven laps,

4140
02:05:36,711 --> 02:05:38,110
he would run six and pull his ankle.

4141
02:05:38,180 --> 02:05:39,013
I've got to sit down,

4142
02:05:39,020 --> 02:05:39,890
he's just that guy.

4143
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:40,671
And then,

4144
02:05:40,671 --> 02:05:41,200
you know,

4145
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:42,290
he listened to the shelf,

4146
02:05:42,450 --> 02:05:43,281
does tough shit,

4147
02:05:43,281 --> 02:05:43,511
bitch.

4148
02:05:43,511 --> 02:05:43,800
You know,

4149
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:44,633
you are,

4150
02:05:45,070 --> 02:05:46,040
he is what he is,

4151
02:05:46,250 --> 02:05:46,700
you know,

4152
02:05:46,700 --> 02:05:47,780
it's not good for everybody else.

4153
02:05:47,781 --> 02:05:48,350
If you try to,

4154
02:05:48,350 --> 02:05:48,681
you know,

4155
02:05:48,681 --> 02:05:49,490
baby fuck them.

4156
02:05:49,490 --> 02:05:50,920
You got to do what you gotta do that,

4157
02:05:50,930 --> 02:05:51,561
that guy,

4158
02:05:51,561 --> 02:05:52,090
you know,

4159
02:05:52,090 --> 02:05:53,210
was always that guy.

4160
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:55,270
And so when he got hooked
on pills and you know,

4161
02:05:55,310 --> 02:05:56,540
blames his whole life on pills.

4162
02:05:56,620 --> 02:05:57,340
Yeah.

4163
02:05:57,340 --> 02:05:57,581
I mean,

4164
02:05:57,581 --> 02:05:58,091
that's the thing,

4165
02:05:58,091 --> 02:05:58,924
that's,

4166
02:05:59,260 --> 02:06:03,610
that's one of the things that frustrates
me in this sort of mission to educate

4167
02:06:03,611 --> 02:06:04,091
the public,

4168
02:06:04,091 --> 02:06:07,570
is that people blame drugs for their,

4169
02:06:07,750 --> 02:06:08,410
uh,

4170
02:06:08,410 --> 02:06:11,800
for some of their shortcomings in
some of the things that are not their

4171
02:06:11,801 --> 02:06:12,551
shortcomings.

4172
02:06:12,551 --> 02:06:13,660
It's not their fault.

4173
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:14,590
Um,

4174
02:06:14,590 --> 02:06:19,590
but we don't get to figure out what's
really going on when you simply blamed the

4175
02:06:20,031 --> 02:06:20,864
drug.

4176
02:06:20,890 --> 02:06:23,860
So there are two crimes that
are committed in that case.

4177
02:06:24,010 --> 02:06:27,760
We don't get to figure out what's
going on your situation and then you're

4178
02:06:27,761 --> 02:06:31,750
restricting access to the drug for
other people who may do it and need it

4179
02:06:31,751 --> 02:06:32,584
responsibly.

4180
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:37,080
And also it's an incredibly complex
discussion and we're breaking it down to

4181
02:06:37,081 --> 02:06:39,660
these very simple terms
that may or may not apply.

4182
02:06:40,080 --> 02:06:40,261
Uh,

4183
02:06:40,261 --> 02:06:42,960
my friend who I told you about
that had a problem with heroin who,

4184
02:06:42,961 --> 02:06:43,170
uh,

4185
02:06:43,170 --> 02:06:46,050
came over to my house to
detox his family was crazy.

4186
02:06:46,310 --> 02:06:46,831
He was,

4187
02:06:46,831 --> 02:06:47,600
he was,

4188
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:48,301
I when I,

4189
02:06:48,301 --> 02:06:49,020
you know,

4190
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:52,590
got to know him better and I sort of
understood his family's medical history.

4191
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:53,910
I understood what was going on.

4192
02:06:53,911 --> 02:06:54,960
He was self medicating.

4193
02:06:54,961 --> 02:06:55,171
He,

4194
02:06:55,171 --> 02:06:59,610
there was a psychiatric issue in his
family and it was not just one person.

4195
02:06:59,910 --> 02:07:01,020
So he,

4196
02:07:01,021 --> 02:07:02,910
this guy was self medicating.

4197
02:07:03,210 --> 02:07:05,190
And I think that's often the case.

4198
02:07:05,191 --> 02:07:08,150
And I think that's one of
the great tragedies of a,

4199
02:07:08,160 --> 02:07:10,950
what happened during the Reagan
administration when they started releasing

4200
02:07:10,951 --> 02:07:12,420
people out of the streets,

4201
02:07:12,421 --> 02:07:16,020
homeless people that were interned before
that they were in mental institutions

4202
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:20,240
and they changed what defines a person
is mentally incompetent and like lucky

4203
02:07:20,250 --> 02:07:21,120
wipe your own ass.

4204
02:07:21,390 --> 02:07:22,201
Can you feed yourself,

4205
02:07:22,201 --> 02:07:24,930
get out of here and just kicked him out
in the street and you have a bunch of

4206
02:07:24,931 --> 02:07:28,170
people walking around talking
to themselves that used
to be in hospitals being

4207
02:07:28,171 --> 02:07:29,004
cared for.

4208
02:07:29,210 --> 02:07:29,750
Yeah,

4209
02:07:29,750 --> 02:07:30,051
no,

4210
02:07:30,051 --> 02:07:30,651
absolutely.

4211
02:07:30,651 --> 02:07:30,921
You,

4212
02:07:30,921 --> 02:07:35,440
you raise all of these complex issues
and I just hope that the public as a of

4213
02:07:35,441 --> 02:07:38,170
this show your show and other
things that are going on,

4214
02:07:38,171 --> 02:07:42,340
I just hope that they ask these tough
questions and that they are critical in

4215
02:07:42,341 --> 02:07:45,730
their own sort of views about these
things because we can all learn as we go.

4216
02:07:45,960 --> 02:07:50,460
I think it all really comes down to
people like you and if there wasn't guys

4217
02:07:50,461 --> 02:07:54,450
like you providing the data and doing
the hard work and sticking your neck out

4218
02:07:54,451 --> 02:07:57,930
there and doing all these shows
and doing bill O'Reilly and,

4219
02:07:58,100 --> 02:07:59,060
and you know,

4220
02:07:59,070 --> 02:08:03,860
disseminating the actual facts and the
data and doing so so confidently and uh,

4221
02:08:03,930 --> 02:08:04,890
