1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,100
Here we go. And boom, we're lot Graham.

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,540
Great to see you again. Nice to be away.
Um, and we were just talking about your,

3
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:14,050
your new book America before that.
There's two versions of it.

4
00:00:14,051 --> 00:00:17,320
There's one version and then there's a
newer version that's a Barnes and noble

5
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:21,070
version that's specific to Barnes and
noble that has an extra whole chapter in

6
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:24,430
it. That's correct. Yeah. And so they
can get that at Barnes and noble.

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,130
I'm just trying to keep bookstores
alive men through either way.

8
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:28,560
I think it's really important.
And that's,

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,660
and that's what are the reasons
that I did this because, because I,

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,010
I had finished the book and then
Barnes and noble came to me through my

11
00:00:36,011 --> 00:00:39,940
publishes and ad said they would like
to do a special edition of the book,

12
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:44,050
but in order to do that, I needed to
write them some extra material. Uh,

13
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:47,890
Adam and I had a lot of material that
I hadn't put in the book and I thought,

14
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:51,010
well, this is an opportunity to
put that out there. Beautiful.

15
00:00:51,011 --> 00:00:54,490
So if people want that, it's a little
bit different than there's a small goal.

16
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,090
Okay. So festival, my website,

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,120
Graham hancock.com has a page about
America before and the link to the Barnes

18
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:07,030
and noble edition is there as well
as the link to the standard edition,

19
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:10,540
which is on Amazon and iTunes and all
kinds of all kinds of other places.

20
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,970
So Graham hancock.com and
the America before page.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,170
The link to the bonds of double edition is
right there. All right, there it is. So,

22
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:18,550
um, how has this, Oh,

23
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,320
before we even get into what does
it go to talks and events. Okay,

24
00:01:23,321 --> 00:01:26,050
we're on the Graham Hancock website.
Go to books.

25
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,340
So I and fucks go to America before Bam,

26
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:34,000
Bam.
Go to United States.

27
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:37,780
You can see Amazon bods and there's
Barnes and nobles, special edition.

28
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,260
Nationalization. Click on that. There
you go. And then the Ebook as well,

29
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:45,620
the ebook audio book, which I
read myself, x is available there.

30
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:49,720
And then if you scroll down, um,
oops, that shouldn't be there.

31
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,400
Damn popups son.
I am so happy you read it yourself.

32
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:58,510
I get angry when someone
else reads someone who I'm
like, come on, he can talk.

33
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,800
Yeah, I enjoy reading. What
books myself and what I've,

34
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,730
what I've learned from feedback I get
from audiences at presentations is people

35
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:09,380
like me doing that. Oh
yeah, for sure. Yeah. Yeah,

36
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,370
a hundred percent it's just weird when
someone else is talking in your voice

37
00:02:12,371 --> 00:02:13,630
like, hey man, I know you're not cramped.

38
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,720
You know that I write fiction as well
as the [inaudible] and the one thing I

39
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:21,220
can't read is my fiction really well.
Yeah, because fictions requires accents.

40
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:24,580
You really need an access
to read a fiction book who
can get into the different

41
00:02:24,581 --> 00:02:27,490
characters. But for a nonfiction
book like America before,

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,370
it's very straightforward for me
just to read it myself, I agree.

43
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:32,470
I'm a tremendous Stephen King Fan,

44
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,580
but when I read Stephen King's books
where he reads them or listen to him when

45
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:39,130
he reads them of their terrible,
he's awful at it.

46
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,610
I don't think at Novelis should,
should read there. Bare on levels.

47
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:44,890
I think that's it. That's a
job for an actor. Oddly enough,

48
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:48,640
I've just been reading Stephen King's
dark tower series that just very near the

49
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,550
end of the seventh volume of that. Yeah.
I'm just a giant fan of his. But man,

50
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:55,630
when he reads it, he reads it like he's
just reading it. Yeah. It's like, Ooh,

51
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,280
this is rough. It's hard to get
behind anyway. Um, America before.

52
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,560
So there's, give us the website,
there's, there's details about the book,

53
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:06,840
there's a page where there
are links to the book.

54
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:09,870
And also the other thing I would like to
take this opportunity to mention is I'm

55
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:14,520
in America and Canada for the next
seven weeks and I'm going to be doing

56
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:18,960
something like 25 presentations in
something like 20 American cities and then

57
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:23,370
three Canadian cities in,
in Vancouver, Montreal,

58
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,760
Toronto and that's all on the talks
and events page of my website.

59
00:03:26,761 --> 00:03:31,320
So if everybody wants to come along
and meet this old man in person,

60
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,360
uh,
I will be Elvis doing those events.

61
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,670
And Are you doing these at
theaters and you allow Q and A's?

62
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,050
Absolutely. I allow, I allow Q
and A's. I encourage that. I,

63
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,310
I feel as an author that frankly speaking,
I'm nothing without my audience.

64
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,460
I owe my audience,
my readers big time.

65
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,810
And what I try to do at events
is to give back as much as I can.

66
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:56,410
So if people want to take pictures
with me, I am absolutely up for that.

67
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,740
I don't understand why anybody
would want to do that, but it's fun.

68
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,521
It's kind of fun.

69
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:03,220
I wouldn't be more to come to the desk
where I'm signing and asked me personal

70
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:06,460
questions. I'm ready to do that.
Sometimes on the British book tour,

71
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:08,290
which I just finished,
I was behind in the,

72
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,750
in the event space for
four hours after the event,

73
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,950
finished siding and taking and taking
pictures. But it's a joy. It's an,

74
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:17,260
it's a really opportunity
for me to interact with the,

75
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,410
with with the people who actually make
my work matters. So that's fantastic.

76
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,250
Beautiful. So what inspired this? I
know there's, there's always been,

77
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,040
well, you, first of all, we should
just say for people who don't know,

78
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,610
you have been at the front of the line
for decades talking about these lost

79
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:40,730
civilizations and w w w,
w from reading your work.

80
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:43,250
I mean, I think our first
read your work in the 90s,

81
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,580
you exposed me to a lot of these,

82
00:04:46,581 --> 00:04:51,560
what were at the time controversial
ideas that have now been substantiated by

83
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:56,240
actual evidence, particularly go back
like tapping and I mean the, the, the,

84
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,990
all the water erosion stuff on the
Sphinx and I've since had doctor Robert

85
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,330
Schoch on the podcast to talk about
that as well. But all this stuff, um,

86
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,370
was at one point very controversial
and now far less. Yes.

87
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,420
I mean whatever traditional academics and
traditional historians that are trying

88
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,490
to, I guess is archeologists
that we're trying to resist,

89
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,600
they've let go a lot of that. They've had
to, with things like go right, actually

90
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,880
tapped.
They've had to because they have it dead,

91
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:24,700
it says as overwhelmed them and go back
to the, he is an excellent example.

92
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:28,900
Prior to the discovery and
excavation of Quebec Tepi, uh,

93
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,440
which is a site in Anatolia in Turkey,
it was the view,

94
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,310
very firm view of archeologists that
there had been no megalithic architecture

95
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,910
anywhere on earth. And when I say
Megalithic, I mean literally big stones,

96
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:43,930
stone circles, huge constructions,
nothing like that before at the very,

97
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:48,340
very earliest, 6,000 years ago. And they
would point to sites in, for example,

98
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:52,330
Malta, a site called [inaudible],
which is about 5,800 years old.

99
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,880
That's the oldest megalithic
architecture in the world.

100
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,910
And they could understand how that was
because these were agricultural societies,

101
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,170
they generated surpluses.

102
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:03,980
You could free up people who could
become specialists in architecture,

103
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:05,300
in astronomy and geometry,

104
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:07,610
and they could apply their skills
to the construction of these sites.

105
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,990
But what they never considered possible
was that a society that was hunter

106
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:16,820
gatherers would have created a gigantic
megalithic site and then suddenly go

107
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:21,530
back. Lee Tapi is discovered,
it dates to 11,600 years ago.

108
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:25,250
It's more than 5,000 years older
than the supposedly oldest megalithic

109
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,360
architecture in the world.

110
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,200
And it is in the center where there had
been no previous evidence of agriculture.

111
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:35,120
But the moment go back in Tempe appears
agriculture appears as well. Um,

112
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,240
and this is just something that's
really hard for archaeology to explain.

113
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,430
They've suddenly got
5,000 years of missing,

114
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,980
of missing history that they've
just never taken into account.

115
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:47,450
And what I see them doing is largely
avoiding the problem rather than getting,

116
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,900
getting to grips with it directly.
And in fact, there have been,

117
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:56,360
there have been a great number of changes
in the last 20 years, which, which,

118
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,460
uh, have worked generally in favor of the
arguments that I've, that I've proposed.

119
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:01,821
Well,

120
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,940
I'm so happy for you because I know that
for a long time you were out there on

121
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:09,680
your own a lot of these theories
very, very much so. And, and uh,

122
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,590
also subjected to the most,

123
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,450
the most blistering and deeply
unpleasant criticism from,

124
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,480
uh, from the archeological fraternity
and from their friends in the, in,

125
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,950
in the media. Like how
dare this journalist, uh,

126
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,670
propose that history might be different
or that we might have a forgotten

127
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,500
chapter in the human story.

128
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:33,800
It was regarded almost as offensive that
I would put this material out there and

129
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,690
archeologist felt it was
their responsibility to show
the public that I was full

130
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:42,050
of shit. And that was, and that
was the whole way my work was,

131
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:45,470
was greeted and to a certain extent
still is greeted by a Kale juice.

132
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:49,820
But things have changed. Central to my
work was the notion of a global cataclysm,

133
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,580
roughly twelve thousand five hundred
twelve thousand eight hundred years ago.

134
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,653
There was,

135
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,040
it made sense to me in 1995 when
I wrote fingerprints of the gods,

136
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,740
but there was no compelling
evidence for a global cataclysm.

137
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:04,790
Then I just add all the evidence seems
to point to that time and a massive

138
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:08,390
global event. And then from
2007 onwards, you know,

139
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,270
more than a decade after I
wrote fingerprints of the Gods,

140
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:15,440
we get a group of more than
60 major scientists who are
seriously proposing that

141
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:20,120
the earth was hit by multiple fragments
of a giant comment 12,800 years ago.

142
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:23,810
And that this caused a huge rise in sea
level and extinctions of mega foreigners.

143
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,160
They are not saying that it also wiped
out a lost advanced civilization of

144
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,400
prehistory. I'm saying
that, but, but what,

145
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:35,510
what has changed is that we now have
compelling hard scientific evidence.

146
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:37,400
I'm not saying every scientist accepts it.

147
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:39,350
It's the nature of science
to dispute findings.

148
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:44,120
But we have a group of 60 major figures
who have seriously proposed this in all

149
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:48,230
the leading mainstream journals. And it's
changed the balance of power in this,

150
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,011
in this argument.

151
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:52,520
Because one thing that they used to say
is Hancock can't be right because there

152
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:55,830
was no global cataclysm, you
know, 12 or thousand years ago.

153
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:59,040
Well now we know there was and there
are various explanations for it.

154
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,030
So that's moved things along.

155
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:05,031
And the other thing that's changed a
lot is the attitude of the man in the

156
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:09,330
street to authority that has changed.

157
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:13,050
Back in the nineties authority
figures were the gatekeepers.

158
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,881
They controlled everything.

159
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:17,010
If the authority figure in a
discipline like archaeology said,

160
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,390
Hancock is completely wrong.

161
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,470
He's made all this stuff up that would
generally be believed not by everybody,

162
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:25,470
but by the majority of
people today to have a,

163
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:29,730
a mainstream authority figures say that
to me is actually an advantage because

164
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:33,870
people are so distrustful of authority
and rightly so because we've been lied to

165
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:36,570
by authority figures in
all fields for so long.

166
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,320
The bullshit has been so enormous
that people are finally waking up.

167
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:42,330
But we can't trust what
authority figures say.

168
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,220
And I think we can thank
the Internet for that.

169
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,740
We can thank the Internet for that.
You,

170
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,350
I'm sure you've seen the more recent
evidence of a crater that they just

171
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:53,730
discovered like fairly recently.
Greenland. Yes. Enormous
and north and enormous.

172
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,740
It's an enormous crater. Uh,
it's, um, 18 miles wide. Uh,

173
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:01,890
it had not been discovered
before because it's under ice.

174
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,530
It's under a lot of ice.
At the end of the ice age,

175
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:07,830
Greenland was one area which never
lost its ice cover completely,

176
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:11,610
whereas North America, everywhere north
of Minnesota was covered in ice, a mild,

177
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,700
sometimes two miles deep.
Europe, the same northern Europe.

178
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:16,860
But greed land kept its eyes,

179
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,830
whereas the other parts of the
world lost their eyes at the,

180
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,150
at the end of the ice age.

181
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,600
And what's interesting about Greenland
is there's already evidence of a comet

182
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:28,230
impact in Greenland,

183
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:32,250
which goes back to papers published in
the proceedings of the National Academy

184
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:37,170
of Sciences in 2013 that they found what
a called impact proxies in Greenland.

185
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,990
In other words, Nano
diamonds, carbons fails,

186
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,490
and no evidence of a lot of
platinum and an iron, uh,

187
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:48,840
was found in a layer in the ice
data to 12,000, 800 years ago.

188
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:51,240
But the next development
that you're absolutely right,

189
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:52,740
and this was just a few months ago,

190
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,690
was the discovery of this humongous crater
in Greenland and evidence that it was

191
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:00,900
caused by an iron impact her of some kind.

192
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,120
Now dating of it.

193
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:08,100
I would be irresponsible to say that
that crater definitely dates to 12,800

194
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:11,220
years ago because the work has
not been done to prove that yet.

195
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:16,221
But what I can say and
what the specialists who
have explored an excavator,

196
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:19,690
the crater are saying is that it's recent,
uh,

197
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,710
they can say for sure that it
happened during the last ice age.

198
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,360
Under it under the crater is nothing but
massively disturbed and destroyed and

199
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,480
completely wrecked ice from the ice age,

200
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:34,070
from the place to sit above it is smooth,
perfect ice from our epoch,

201
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,980
which is called the Holocene,
which began about 11,600 years ago.

202
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:42,570
So all the evidence suggests that this
created dates to that period between

203
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:45,300
twelve thousand eight hundred and
eleven thousand six hundred years ago,

204
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,240
but to absolutely confirm that
more work needs to be done,

205
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,890
but it's part of a growing pattern.

206
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,820
The younger dryas impact to they is,
they call themselves,

207
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,240
they call this the younger
dryas impact hypothesis.

208
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,640
And it's because there was a period in,

209
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,840
in the earth's geological history that
geologists called the younger dryas,

210
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:06,760
which lasted for 1,200 years,

211
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:11,470
from 12,800 to 11,600 years ago.
It's a very mysterious period.

212
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:15,580
We see all the megafauna dying
off suddenly and rapidly.

213
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:19,990
We see rises in sea level. We see a huge
collapse in global temperature. It's a,

214
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:23,760
it's a cataclysmic, a
epoch. And, and what, what,

215
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,160
what is becoming clearer and clearer,
uh,

216
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,700
is that the evidence that a
comet behind it was behind it is,

217
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:33,820
it is extremely strong.
And as more and more evidence comes in,

218
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,530
we realized how widespread it was.

219
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:38,740
So they found evidence of the impact
as far south as Antarctica. Now,

220
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:41,260
previously they were focused
very much on North American.

221
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:46,240
Now as far south as Antarctica, as far
east as Syria, this was truly a global,

222
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,480
a global event and it changed the world.
And I think,

223
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:54,780
and it's my case that it wiped our
memory of a previous episode of,

224
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,330
of human civilization that right at
the epicenter of this cataclysm was a

225
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:02,350
civilization that we would regard
as advanced, not as simple hunter,

226
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:06,910
gather a civilization which was utterly
wiped out in this cataclysmic event.

227
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,610
And I should say for anyone who's
really fascinated right now,

228
00:13:10,611 --> 00:13:15,611
please maybe pause and go listen to
the one that the two that you did with

229
00:13:16,251 --> 00:13:19,910
Randall Carlson. Yeah. We're really
goes into depth about the impact,

230
00:13:19,911 --> 00:13:21,410
the evidence of these impacts,

231
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,560
the evidence of the very quick demise of
the Ice Age and what may have resulted

232
00:13:26,991 --> 00:13:30,500
in all these floods that you read about
in the epic of Gilgamesh that you read

233
00:13:30,501 --> 00:13:34,700
about a Noah's Ark and that all these
things are probably tales that have

234
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:38,750
stories that people pass down from
generation to generation that survived.

235
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,451
Yeah.

236
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:43,650
Because we now know that at that time
between twelve thousand eight hundred and

237
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,041
eleven thousand six hundred years ago,

238
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:48,310
truly global cataclysmic events
involving rapid rises in sea level, uh,

239
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,420
did occur. And suddenly the
worldwide tradition of, uh,

240
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:56,630
of a global flood stops being just a myth
and starts being a memory and account

241
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,020
of,
of real events.

242
00:13:58,021 --> 00:14:01,480
It's been my privilege to work very
closely with rattle Carlson. He's a,

243
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:05,580
Randall is absolutely amazing.
He is a total genius.

244
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:09,480
He's also a gentle giant and such
a kind, generous, spirited person.

245
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:13,140
It's a joy to work with them and every
minute spent with him as an education,

246
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:15,040
I had the privilege of
traveling across the channel,

247
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,960
scab lands in Washington state with
Randall and seeing things through his eyes

248
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:21,810
really opened my eyes to the
scale of this disaster. You know,

249
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:24,500
you could look at these giant
boulders called glaciated erotics,

250
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,790
and they just look odd sitting
there in the landscape.

251
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,320
But when you really consider how they got
there that they got there in icebergs,

252
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:35,850
the size of oil tankers that were carried
on floods that were at least 500 up to

253
00:14:35,851 --> 00:14:39,350
a thousand feet deep that we're
tearing through the channels. Scab,

254
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:41,760
lads literally ripping
the landscape apart.

255
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,990
Then the icebergs would ground on valley
sides. The flood waters would recede,

256
00:14:45,991 --> 00:14:49,740
the icebergs would be left there, giant
icebergs, and as they melted away,

257
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:53,210
they revealed the rocks that had in chain
that we're caught up within them and

258
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:54,560
they're scattered all over the landscape.

259
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:59,561
And you look at that and you think
anything that was underneath that 12,800

260
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:04,220
years ago is gone completely.
There can't be anything left of it at all.

261
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,570
Utterly,
utterly destroyed.

262
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,140
And I would encourage people that are
interested in this to please watch the

263
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,250
youtube videos of it.

264
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:14,450
Cause Randall provides all sorts of
video and photographic evidence where you

265
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:19,430
can take a look at the landscape and you
get a perspective of how immense this

266
00:15:19,431 --> 00:15:22,640
destruction was. Yeah, it's, it's
really, it's really important to,

267
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:26,040
to see that because it's easy enough
to talk about floods and, and,

268
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,020
and cataclysms.

269
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:32,021
But actually to see its effect on the
landscape directly is it has an emotional,

270
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,480
an emotional impact.
I felt,

271
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,450
I felt emotional traffic traveling
across the challenge, Gab lands,

272
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:39,920
really realizing that this was,

273
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:45,250
was the heart of an event that
changed the world completely.

274
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,980
And the evidence continues to build.

275
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:52,940
I have in America before I have not
gone over old ground that I went over in

276
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:56,260
magicians of the gods that we
covered in the various, um,

277
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,110
interviews and podcasts in which it's
really a good idea that people take a look

278
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:00,950
at.
But I,

279
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:05,840
what I have done is added
the new information published
since 2015 which further

280
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:10,070
supports the younger dryas impact
hypothesis and the notion that multiple

281
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:11,880
fragments of a giant comment,
uh,

282
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,350
hit the earth and created an
absolute global catastrophe.

283
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,940
So what was the motivation behind
creating this book America before?

284
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,240
It's a curious mixture of things.

285
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:28,330
I have been exploring the possibility
of a lost civilization for more than 25

286
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:32,210
years.
That was the essence of my book,

287
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:36,950
fingerprints of the Gods
that was published in 1995
that there has been a huge

288
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,630
forgot an episode in human history.

289
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:42,410
I continued to follow that in a series
of other books and by the time I got to

290
00:16:42,411 --> 00:16:47,411
2002 when I published a book called
underworld that followed seven years of

291
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:51,050
scuba diving on continental shelves,

292
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:55,250
looking for structures that were submerged
by rising sea levels at the end of

293
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,090
the last ice age, I really felt I'd done
it. I felt I'd walk the walk, I put,

294
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,220
put out to the public a massive
body of information and I thought,

295
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:09,221
my role in this is over and I can breathe
a sigh of relief because it's hot in

296
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,110
this particular kitchen and
I can go do something else.

297
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,180
And I ended up writing a
book about psychedelics.

298
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:17,660
I ended up writing supernatural meetings
with the ancient teachers of mankind,

299
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:20,990
but the role of psychedelics in the
origins of the, of the human story.

300
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:25,130
But then new information started to
come out that touched on the lost

301
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:28,890
civilization idea. And I couldn't just
stand by and ignore that information.

302
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,750
That's why I published in
magicians of the Gods in 2015.

303
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,300
And then as I was researching that book,

304
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,710
I became aware of something I hadn't
realized before that there's a mass of new

305
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:42,920
information from the Americas,
specifically from the Americas,

306
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:47,290
which completely rewrites the story of
human history that the Americas, um,

307
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,910
have been misrepresented,
uh, for a very long time, uh,

308
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,980
by archaeology.

309
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:56,040
And archeologists will be annoyed with
me for saying that they have a way of

310
00:17:56,041 --> 00:18:00,240
forgetting their own arrows, uh, of
saying, Oh, well, we knew that all along.

311
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,320
It wasn't,
it wasn't the case,

312
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:05,490
but the fact of the matter remains that
for best part of 50 years from the 1960s

313
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:07,380
through until about 2010,

314
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:12,680
American archeology was locked in a
dogma that they actually had a name for,

315
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,940
which was Clovis first, uh, that
they invented a name for a culture.

316
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,450
They call them the Clovis culture.
We don't know what they called themselves.

317
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,040
They were hunter gatherers.

318
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,440
They first appear in the
archeological record 13,400 years ago,

319
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,160
and they've banished from the
archeological record 12,600 years ago.

320
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:33,510
And for a very long time,

321
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,980
it was maintained adamantly that these
were the first Americans that no human

322
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:42,870
being touched the soil of the
Americas until 13,000, 400 years ago.

323
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,990
Just animals.
But no human beings present at all.

324
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,280
And any archeologist who
attempted to dispute that dogma,

325
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,510
and I use the word deliberately, there
should be no room for dogma in science,

326
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:59,810
but any archeologist who challenged that
would face severe problems with his or

327
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:01,284
her career,

328
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,610
they would be mocked and humiliated at
conferences like an archeologist called

329
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,660
Jackson Kumar's from, from Canada who
excavated in the, in the, in the Yukon,

330
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:14,390
humiliated at conferences, insulted,
accused of making stuff up. Uh,

331
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:18,540
their research funding would be withdrawn
basically to challenge Clovis first

332
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,120
was the end of your archaeological career.
So naturally,

333
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,330
very few archeologists wanted
to challenge Clovis first.

334
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:27,360
What was this gentleman in the Yukon?
What was this is called Jack sank.

335
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:32,280
Mars a and interestingly, the
Smithsonian just in 2017, uh,

336
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:35,850
did a big kind of mayor Kulpa
big admission about this,

337
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:37,410
that everybody had got things wrong,

338
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,830
that Jack's Hank Mars had been
ruined by the Clovis first lobby,

339
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,670
but he'd been right all along the site.
He excavated in the Yukon,

340
00:19:44,671 --> 00:19:49,671
was re excavated in 2017 and every single
thing he said was correct even though

341
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:53,280
they had just sneered at him.
What was he?

342
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,900
He was activating in the 1980s in the
1990 [inaudible] he's still alive.

343
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,680
He's still alive. Yeah. Well I
think he's been indicated. You know,

344
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:02,221
and it's kind of,

345
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:06,190
it's kind of nice to be vindicated that
that there's almost a place in folk lore,

346
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,680
folk law for the, for the individual who
is scorned and humiliated, you know, by,

347
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,640
by others. But who turns out to
be, to be right. And he was right.

348
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,970
But my point about this is that what it
meant was since it was the dogma that

349
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:25,170
Clovis was first, that they oldest
dates were 13,400 years ago.

350
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,590
There seemed to be no logic to
archeologists in digging deeper.

351
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,770
You know how it is with
archaeology that the,

352
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,650
the upper levels are the youngest and
the deeper you go, the older it gets.

353
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:38,880
That's why we say Upper Paleolithic for
the late Ice Age and lower Paleolithic

354
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:43,890
for the late stone age and lower for the
older stone age and the feeling was no

355
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:48,880
need to dig below the Clovis layer
because we already know that there were no

356
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,380
human beings.
Then before that.

357
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,860
And then a few archeologists I mentioned
Jack Sank Mars. But uh, but, uh,

358
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:58,861
another is all good year
from the University of South
Carolina who excavated a

359
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,330
site called topper in South Carolina now.

360
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,530
Now topper is an incredibly rich
Clovis site. It's full of their tools,

361
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:06,071
their points.

362
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:09,520
They made these special special Flint
points that we used as arrowheads and

363
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:11,680
spear great Clovis site.

364
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:17,310
He finished excavating the Clovis level
and then he did something that was

365
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:21,970
supposed not to be done. He decided to
dig deeper and he carried on deeping down,

366
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,160
digging down.
And there was a,

367
00:21:23,161 --> 00:21:26,140
a layer of about a meter and
a half of of barren soil.

368
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,900
And then beneath that
more human artifacts.

369
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,530
And they finally date those back
to more than 50,000 years ago.

370
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,690
And then in 2017,

371
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,470
published in nature by Tom Demorais,

372
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:42,380
who's the chief paleontologist at the
San Diego Natural History Museum, uh,

373
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:47,290
at a bunch of other very high level
paleontologists published in nature

374
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:47,771
magazine,

375
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:52,570
evidence for human presence in
North America 130,000 years ago.

376
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,060
Now this is really put the
cat amongst the pigeons. Now,

377
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:59,720
if humans were pressed North America
130,000 years ago and archeologists have

378
00:21:59,721 --> 00:22:04,150
been telling us for 50 years that they
were only present from 13,000 years ago,

379
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:09,040
that's 10 times as long that we've had
humans in North America capable of doing

380
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:13,360
stuff and the archeological dogma has
prevented any search for what they were

381
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:17,590
doing until, until very recently. What
was the evidence from 130,000 years ago?

382
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:22,150
Okay, so what, it's not the, let me be
clear about this because, because this is,

383
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:25,060
this is something that is often
misrepresented in, in my views.

384
00:22:25,061 --> 00:22:30,061
It is not the evidence for an advanced
civilization that we find a 130,000 years

385
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:35,620
ago in America. The evidence that we
find is evidence for human presence.

386
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:39,130
And what they were doing was very
much stone age stuff. It's a Mastodon,

387
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,480
it's a mastodon skeleton. Uh,
that was, that was excavated.

388
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:48,040
It was actually found by accident during
road construction near near San Diego.

389
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:53,020
And an archeologist was attached to the
road construction crew at immediately

390
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:56,200
stopped construction and they
investigated it thoroughly.

391
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,440
And what they found was so much dynamite
in the early 1990s when they found it,

392
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,440
that they decided not to publish at
the time because what they found was

393
00:23:05,441 --> 00:23:10,210
evidence that those mastodon bones had
been cracked open by human beings using

394
00:23:10,211 --> 00:23:13,330
tools and that the marrow
had been extracted,

395
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,510
that one Tusk could be left
standing upright in the ground.

396
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,340
And another had been left beside it,

397
00:23:18,341 --> 00:23:22,810
that FEMA had a femur of the animal had
been taken away completely from the site.

398
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,800
Uh,
and there was assemblages of,

399
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:27,670
of instruments that we use
to smash and break the bones.

400
00:23:27,671 --> 00:23:31,900
And the conclusion of the team was that
only one kind of creature could have

401
00:23:31,901 --> 00:23:36,610
done that work using tools on a mastodon.
And that's human beings.

402
00:23:36,611 --> 00:23:38,710
That's classic,
classic human behavior.

403
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,790
So this sets the goalposts
in a totally different place.

404
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:46,910
Suddenly we have to consider that
humans have been in for 130,000 years.

405
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,620
We already know that a dogmatic approach
of archeology has rather refused to

406
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:54,200
look at anything older
than 13,000 years ago.

407
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:59,350
And what it does is it generates an engine
of demand that we need to be looking

408
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:02,870
at those missing hundred thousand plus
years. We need to be looking at it hard.

409
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:03,171
Of course,

410
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:08,120
the immediate reaction has not been to
go looking for stuff in the other hundred

411
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,180
thousand years. Most archeologists have
responded by saying, this is impossible.

412
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,800
It can't be.
It can't be so,

413
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:15,320
but that's precisely what
they said to Jack Sank Mars,

414
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,370
who said that humans were in bluefish
caves in the Yukon 25,000 years ago,

415
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:22,610
and it's precisely what they said to
our Goodyear who said humans had been at

416
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:27,611
topper 50,000 years ago and they were
both right and I believe that Tom Demorais

417
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:28,700
and his team,

418
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:33,290
you don't get a big article published
in nature unless it's already pretty

419
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:36,380
solidly based and pretty much peer
reviews. It has produced a reaction.

420
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,720
I would be wrong to say that
it's universally accepted.

421
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:42,230
It's very much challenged. That is
intriguing. What is the challenge?

422
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,970
The challenge fundamentally comes from
we archeologists know that there were no

423
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:50,210
human beings in the Americas that
far back. To put it in perspective.

424
00:24:50,211 --> 00:24:54,980
It's about 60,000 years before the first
evidence of human beings in Europe. Uh,

425
00:24:54,981 --> 00:24:59,570
it's about 60,000 years before the first
evidence of human beings in Australia.

426
00:24:59,571 --> 00:25:01,880
And this is just evidence of
the first human beings. Yes,

427
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,010
we have to point out how
difficult it is to find evidence.

428
00:25:04,011 --> 00:25:05,810
Extremely difficult to find.
You know,

429
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,530
sometimes we imagined that archeologists
are working with masses of skeletal

430
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:12,140
material low. They're not, then
they're not. I mean the whole,

431
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,650
this is one of the ironies,
the whole Clovis first dogma,

432
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,080
you would think that they had
masses of material to work with.

433
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:21,890
They did have the tools, but in
terms of skeletal remains, just one,

434
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:27,250
just one single skeletal remains from one
of the things that Michael Shermer had

435
00:25:27,381 --> 00:25:27,741
sent me,

436
00:25:27,741 --> 00:25:32,741
was this a dispute that perhaps the
bones had been cracked open by the

437
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,840
excavation material?
Yeah. Excabation machines.

438
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,430
I saw Michael's email email last night
and I appreciate that Michael wants to

439
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:44,490
continue to engage with this subject
and that's his job. He's a pro.

440
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:47,930
He's a professional skeptic and it's
his, his role to do so. But what he,

441
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,350
what he misses that it's true that
a new paper has been published,

442
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,950
which raises questions over the,
uh,

443
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,020
what's called the Cerruti Mastodon site,

444
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,320
which is the site that Tom Demorais
at San Diego Natural History Museum

445
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,760
excavated.
And what's interesting since I can,

446
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,900
since Michael took the trouble to
write the questions, can I just, sure.

447
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,340
Can I just read you something that
I responded to them this? Sure.

448
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:18,650
Which is the microphone. Those, yeah.
Yeah. Basic. Basically this, this,

449
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:23,710
this paper was in no way a refutation
of the original paper in nature.

450
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:27,380
As a matter of fact,

451
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:32,630
the gentleman who wrote that paper
never even looked at the archaeological

452
00:26:32,631 --> 00:26:37,280
remains that are in the now in the
San Diego Natural History Museum.

453
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,690
Um, what it is, what he
based it on, his reference,

454
00:26:41,691 --> 00:26:45,240
I'm quoting from the
abstract of the paper itself,

455
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,740
reference to a freeway right of
way map and construction plans,

456
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:54,540
contemporary road building practices and
work site photographs available on the

457
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:57,180
Internet. In other words,
the site was not visited.

458
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,430
They simply looked at
secondary references.

459
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:03,510
They did not look at the archeological
material and they ignored the entire

460
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:07,350
argument of Tom Demmer and his colleagues
who had already addressed that issue.

461
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,980
They didn't look at the bones, they
did not look at the bones. When you,

462
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,020
when you break a fresh bone,

463
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,490
it has a characteristic kind of spiral
fracture that does not happen when you

464
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:18,840
break a fossilized bone.

465
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:23,700
And Tom Debray and his team specifically
ruled out road making machinery as

466
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:26,850
responsible for this breaking pattern
because they actually carried out

467
00:27:26,851 --> 00:27:30,750
experiments on a modern elephants,
deceased elephants,

468
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:32,010
and they broke their bones.

469
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:36,180
And the kind of fracture that you get
in a fresh green bone is completely

470
00:27:36,181 --> 00:27:39,120
different from the kind of Fletcher you
get in a, in a, in a fossilized bone.

471
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,510
So unfortunately this paper pays,
pays no attention to that.

472
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,910
It just looks at road plans and
says there was roadwork there.

473
00:27:44,911 --> 00:27:48,650
It must have been done by roadwork. I
think it's very sloppy, very weak, and a,

474
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,440
it's certainly not the answer.
We can expect ongoing debate and that is,

475
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,230
that is healthy.
But this is not a strong case at all.

476
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,320
So this points to the first evidence
that we found and is there any effort

477
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:05,601
underway to try to uncover more evidence
from a similar 12 I'm going to cite to

478
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:10,290
Tom. Tom Decorated the chief
paleontologist San Diego
Natural History Museum.

479
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:13,920
That's what he would like to see.
He makes the point to be I interview him.

480
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:16,320
I said, I spent a day with him
that actually steam museum.

481
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:17,610
He was very generous with his time.

482
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:22,611
I did an extended interview and I quote
from it in in America before and his

483
00:28:22,651 --> 00:28:24,390
wish is that archeologists,

484
00:28:24,391 --> 00:28:29,160
instead of spending all that time trying
to find ways to dismiss and get rid of

485
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:30,180
his findings,

486
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:34,650
his wishes that they would spend a little
bit at that time looking at deposits

487
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:39,830
older than 13,400 years and even being
willing to go back as far as 130,000

488
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:44,460
years. That's, that's would be
a proper scientific response.

489
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,760
Here is a third body of work put forward
by a very senior group of scientists

490
00:28:50,191 --> 00:28:51,930
who hesitated before they published it.

491
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,000
They had the information
back in the 1990s,

492
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:59,001
but it wasn't until refined dating
techniques later than in the 21st century

493
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:03,300
that they finally were sure what they
had and that they published it in nature

494
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:07,420
in 2017. It's a, it's, it's a,
it's an important study. Um,

495
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:12,240
and I think what's going to happen
is that we're going to find much more

496
00:29:12,241 --> 00:29:16,080
evidence of a very ancient human
presence in the America America's,

497
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:19,770
and that's what Tom Demorais thinks
as well. Um, and as he points out,

498
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,380
if we don't look,
then we're never going to find,

499
00:29:22,381 --> 00:29:24,830
if we allow dogma to stop
us looking and saying, well,

500
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,230
it's impossible that humans were
in the Americas 130,000 years ago,

501
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:31,640
so we won't bother to look what a
failure of science that is. And, and,

502
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:35,640
and to spend all the time instead of
trying to get rid of the evidence that

503
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,320
doesn't fit the current paradigm.

504
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,800
It's so fascinating that
just as fortuitous discovery
during a construction site

505
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:43,810
could change the way
people perceive things.

506
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:47,350
And you just got to wonder how
much of that stuff is. And I mean,

507
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:50,590
how deep did they have to go to find
these mastodon bones? So this is a,

508
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:53,140
this is a road cut that's being made.
So those would be,

509
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:55,690
does it be pretty deep down 10,
15 feet down the,

510
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,200
the greater is going through it and,
and flattening them.

511
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,590
It varies from place to place
depending on on soil deposition,

512
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:06,160
the stratification, the stratification
of the soil. But what the key,

513
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:10,030
the key point is that what you need
to do is go deeper than 13,000,

514
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:15,031
400 years ago and you need to do so with
dedication and vigor and with some kind

515
00:30:15,851 --> 00:30:18,950
of funding. And at the moment
archeology doesn't, uh,

516
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,560
doesn't see the point of that.

517
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:25,780
If the paper in nature by
Tom Demorais was alone,

518
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,760
if there were nothing else than that,
uh,

519
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:31,000
I wouldn't place so much trust in it.

520
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,970
But I've spent a lot of time during
the researching of this book with

521
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:37,630
archeologists who dig, dig, dig, dig,

522
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,430
dig deeper.

523
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,870
And what those archeologists all confirm
is that there have been human beings in

524
00:30:43,871 --> 00:30:46,240
the Americas for tens
of thousands of years.

525
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:50,590
And it's not surprising that that can
be pushed back to 130,000 years ago.

526
00:30:50,591 --> 00:30:54,250
Because part of the argument about the
peopling of the Americas has to do with a

527
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:59,251
place that we now call the Bering
straits between Alaska and Siberia,

528
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,200
which during the Ice Age,

529
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,820
where at times a land bridge,
they were exposed because of,

530
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,170
because of low at sea levels,

531
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:13,560
but migrants who crossed that land
bridge from Siberia on many occasions,

532
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:18,040
over periods of tens of thousands of years
would find themselves confronted then

533
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,820
by the North American ice cap,
which oddly wasn't at the tip of Alaska,

534
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:25,390
but began further in. So there was
living space in a bit of Alaska,

535
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:27,520
but you couldn't get through
the ice mountains. These,

536
00:31:27,521 --> 00:31:31,870
these literally ice mountains to two
miles deep covering the whole of North

537
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:36,270
America and preventing access
to the unglazed created, uh,

538
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,330
parts of America.

539
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:42,520
The thing is that what happened
around 13,400 years ago,

540
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:46,330
there had been a period of global warming
and the ice sheets began to melt and a

541
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:49,990
corridor opened up between what's called
the Cordillera and ice sheet and the

542
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:50,980
Laurentide ice sheet,

543
00:31:50,981 --> 00:31:54,520
the two major ice keeps in North America
and it's thought that the migration

544
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:56,230
came through that corridor.
Well,

545
00:31:56,231 --> 00:32:01,231
the thing is that exactly the same thing
happened between 140,000 years ago and

546
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:04,480
120,000 years ago there was
an episode of global warming,

547
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,580
an ice free corridor opened up and the
same opportunity to enter the Americas

548
00:32:08,581 --> 00:32:11,650
was there at that period than
it was at the later period.

549
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:15,850
And Tom Demaris point and mine is that
we have to pay much more attention to

550
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:20,420
that earlier period. And that's really
why I've gone ahead and uh, and,

551
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:25,430
and written this book is to try to
put before a broad general audience,

552
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,220
hopefully in, in language that, that,

553
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:33,220
that makes sense and an assembly of all
the latest information that casts doubt

554
00:32:33,221 --> 00:32:35,290
on the story we've been told.
Because my goodness,

555
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:40,070
if archaeology is wrong about the story
of the peopling of the Americas, if

556
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,220
it's radically wrong as
it now appears to be,

557
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,520
then our whole understanding
of human history has to change.

558
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:50,750
It's not just the history of the Americas,
it's the history of the entire world.

559
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:55,751
It has been an absolute article of faith
amongst archeologists that civilization

560
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:00,860
began in the old world. And, uh, indeed,

561
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:01,400
I have a,

562
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:06,400
I have a book in my library called
history begins at summa and it's by Samuel

563
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,420
Noah Kramer are very renowned
archaeologist. Uh, and it's a,

564
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:11,570
it's a good book actually.

565
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,250
But the argument is that this is where
civilization began in the culture that we

566
00:33:16,251 --> 00:33:20,240
call the Sumerians in Mesopotamia
between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers,

567
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,030
and that it began about 6,000 years ago.

568
00:33:23,031 --> 00:33:27,860
And that civilization is
entirely an invention of the
old world that has nothing

569
00:33:27,861 --> 00:33:31,940
to do with the new world at all because
of the new world was populated so late.

570
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,860
This has,
this has been the,

571
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,520
this has been the argument and this
is the argument that now radically and

572
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:42,440
suddenly begins to change that the
Americas, this enormous landmass resorts,

573
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:47,300
rich, bountiful in, in every
way south of Minnesota,

574
00:33:47,301 --> 00:33:51,170
south of the ice cap, vast land
areas that are, that are bad.

575
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,290
We'll get into South America, Central
America, South America, the Amazon,

576
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:58,040
just huge areas of land that were very,
very offered.

577
00:33:58,041 --> 00:34:02,840
Great potential for human occupation.
Dogma has said there were no humans there.

578
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:07,220
Now the first bits of evidence are coming
out that says there were humans there,

579
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,450
and if that's the case,

580
00:34:08,451 --> 00:34:11,900
then we must consider the possibility
that the story of civilization might've

581
00:34:11,901 --> 00:34:14,330
begun in the Americas,
not in the old world at all.

582
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,350
It might be a new world invention,
not another word, adventure.

583
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:21,390
Some of the more fascinating pieces of
evidence in South America have come out

584
00:34:21,391 --> 00:34:26,391
recently about these channels and pathways
that they've found in the Amazon that

585
00:34:26,791 --> 00:34:28,800
could not have been created any other way,

586
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:33,600
but by humans creating irrigation,
humans creating the, like,

587
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:36,210
it appears like grids,
like a city grid.

588
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:40,080
Definitely the Amazon is
a colossal mystery and a,

589
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:44,710
it's one of the subjects that I explore
in depth in America before. First of all,

590
00:34:44,711 --> 00:34:48,580
to give some basic figures.
The Amazon basin is huge.

591
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:53,610
The Amazon Basin is 7 million square
kilometers in area and within it,

592
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,930
five and a half million square kilometers,
uh,

593
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,740
remains almost entirely
unstudied by archeologists.

594
00:35:02,741 --> 00:35:06,040
And that's the five and a half million
square kilometers that is still covered

595
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,130
by dense rain forest.
And to put that into perspective,

596
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:13,270
five and a half million square kilometers
is the size of the entire Indian

597
00:35:13,271 --> 00:35:17,590
subcontinent. So it's like saying
we've done world archeology,

598
00:35:17,591 --> 00:35:21,850
but we've just ignored India. You
know, we've done world archeology,

599
00:35:21,851 --> 00:35:26,200
but we just ignored the Amazon is the
same at the same migrant five and a half

600
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,070
million square kilometers. The
view was, again, there was a dogma,

601
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:32,380
there was a preconception, human beings
couldn't have flourished in the Amazon.

602
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:37,200
It's a, it's not a resource rich
area. The soils are poor. Um,

603
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,550
it's a difficult area, challenging to
get to very far from the Bering straits.

604
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,590
So the view was that humans hadn't
entered the Amazon until about a thousand

605
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:49,320
years ago. And then
gradually, little by little,

606
00:35:49,321 --> 00:35:53,610
that view has begun to change and it's
begun to change because of the tragic

607
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,840
clearances of the Amazon.

608
00:35:54,841 --> 00:35:59,400
Because the Amazon rain
forest is literally being
cut down and turned into soya

609
00:35:59,401 --> 00:36:01,980
bean farms and cattle ranchers.

610
00:36:01,981 --> 00:36:06,420
And in that cutting down process has
emerged things that shouldn't be there at

611
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:08,400
all. Uh, for example,

612
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:12,600
evidence that large cities flourished
in the Amazon enormous cities,

613
00:36:12,601 --> 00:36:14,670
which were larger than the,

614
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:18,770
there was a Spanish explorer who went
down the Amazon River system in 1541 to

615
00:36:18,771 --> 00:36:19,591
1542,

616
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:24,060
he was the first European to cross the
entire length of South America from west

617
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:29,010
to east. Uh, along the Amazon, he
reported seeing incredible cities,

618
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:33,920
advanced arts and craft, millions
of people, a thriving culture. Uh,

619
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,870
and a hundred years later when
other Europeans got into the Amazon,

620
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:40,320
they couldn't find these cities. So
they said, oh, Francisco, Arianna,

621
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:43,500
that was his name, made it all up.
It was just a, it was just a fantasy.

622
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,280
And then in the last decade is the
clearances at the Amazon have proceeded.

623
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:49,560
We've begun to see the
traces of those cities.

624
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:54,060
What happened was that the Spaniards
brought small pox into the Amazon.

625
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:58,980
Smallpox devastated the local population
because there was no immunity to it.

626
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:03,090
There was a massive die off. The
cities were deserted within a 50 years.

627
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:06,660
They were completely overgrown by the
jungle and that's why they were not seen

628
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,790
by the explorers who came
in a hundred years later.

629
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:10,050
But now the youngest being cleared,

630
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:13,800
those cities are emerging and we can
say that, uh, a city like London,

631
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:17,220
which had a population of roughly
50,000 in the 16th century,

632
00:37:17,221 --> 00:37:19,380
there were cities of that
size all over the Amazon.

633
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:24,930
Huge numbers of them and possible total
population of the Amazon that exceeded

634
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,080
20 million people. Yes, 20 billion.

635
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:31,380
This is the latest evidence from the
Amazon. And then you ask yourself,

636
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:35,280
how did they do that? How did they
feed 20 million people in the Amazon?

637
00:37:35,281 --> 00:37:38,070
Because it's a fact
rainforest soils are poor.

638
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,250
It's one of the reasons these soya
bean farms are really stupid idea.

639
00:37:41,251 --> 00:37:42,810
Because once you clear the rain forest,

640
00:37:42,811 --> 00:37:47,160
the land is largely unfair tile and you
can't grow stuff on it for very long.

641
00:37:47,161 --> 00:37:48,750
So how did they feed all these people?

642
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:54,020
The answer was they invented a
soil and that soil has a name,

643
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:55,710
it's called Tara Prater.

644
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:59,940
Archeologists referred to it as Amazonian
dark earth or Amazonian black earth.

645
00:37:59,941 --> 00:38:03,720
It's a manmade soil.
It's thousands of years old.

646
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:07,320
It's full of microbes that are
not found in a joining soil.

647
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:10,090
It's based around bio char.
Uh,

648
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:15,150
and you can take a handful of 8,000 year
old terra prater and you can add it to

649
00:38:15,151 --> 00:38:18,780
barren soil and that soil
will instantly become fertile.

650
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:22,620
It's highly sought after in the Amazon
and it explains how they fed these people.

651
00:38:22,621 --> 00:38:25,170
There was silence in the
atmosphere to create this, well,

652
00:38:25,171 --> 00:38:26,820
this is something that's not understood.

653
00:38:26,821 --> 00:38:30,480
It's still not understood
by social experts to this
day is to how that was done.

654
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:32,640
But it's one of many intriguing evidences,

655
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,610
pieces of evidence of
much higher a development

656
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,780
in the Amazon that it has been given
credit for and have a kind of science in

657
00:38:40,781 --> 00:38:45,220
the, Jamie's got an image of
it up there. So this is a,
this is Tara. Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

658
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:50,230
Exactly. So was that done by burns? Did
these controlled burns? They did. They,

659
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:55,210
one way that it was achieved was,
uh, was to do wet burning, um,

660
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,770
of middens.
They would be,

661
00:38:56,771 --> 00:38:59,860
they would be burned and smolder
they wouldn't bend fiercely,

662
00:38:59,861 --> 00:39:03,500
which just produces charcoal. They would,
they would burn and smolder. Um, and,

663
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:07,000
and that by what is called
biochar would result.

664
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:08,650
And that's part of the
fertility of the soil.

665
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:11,830
But the mystery is the
microbial content of the soil,

666
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,160
which is completely different from
the microbes in neighboring soils.

667
00:39:15,161 --> 00:39:19,570
And that's remains unexplained. So do
they, what are the theories? Composting,

668
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:23,020
some sort of advanced compost as some
sort of, some sort of advanced composting.

669
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,920
But again,

670
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,180
what has not been explained is that Ma
is the Mike microbial content of these

671
00:39:28,181 --> 00:39:32,530
soils. So they're there, first of all
is an issue of how, uh, two things,

672
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,210
how large populations get fed in the
Amazon and evidence that there was a

673
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:41,500
culture in the Amazon that was capable
of manipulating the environment in such a

674
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:44,870
way that it could support
large populations with the
invention of terror. Prater.

675
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,140
Secondly,
new evidence previously not recognized.

676
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:52,480
The Amazon is basically a garden.
The Amazon is a manmade rain forest.

677
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:57,580
Uh, there are certain trees like Brazil
nut trees or the ice cream bean tree,

678
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,500
which are food crops, which are very,
very valuable. And they dominate the,

679
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,350
uh, the, the tree regime
in the Amazon. They,

680
00:40:05,351 --> 00:40:08,290
what's what's referred to as hypo
dominant species. In other words,

681
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:13,291
people living in the Amazon over thousands
of years selected certain trees which

682
00:40:13,331 --> 00:40:17,830
they then cultivated and grew.
So the whole thing is not simply a wild,

683
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:18,850
pristine rainforest.

684
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:23,370
It's a very ancient manmade environment
and emerging from that manmade

685
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:27,190
environment as well as evidence of
large cities, large populations,

686
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:32,430
and this mysterious dark earth
are huge geometrical structures.

687
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,391
Um,
and again,

688
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:37,840
I go into this at length in America
before because I love this mystery.

689
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:42,980
We have in the UK structures
that are called hinges. Um,

690
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,860
I live in the city of bath and about
30 miles away there's a beautiful site

691
00:40:47,861 --> 00:40:51,760
called aviary and another more
famous site called Stonehenge.

692
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,470
And what a Henge is,

693
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,160
is a ditch which has been dug deep and
then an embankment has been pushed up

694
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:02,170
outside the ditch.
When people first saw these structures,

695
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:04,330
they wondered if they'd
been built for defense,

696
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:07,000
but then it became obvious they
hadn't been built for defense.

697
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:11,920
Because if you want to create a moat,
you put it outside your embankment,

698
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:15,610
not insight. You're in Bankman.
So in a hand is an earthwork,

699
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:19,870
which consists of a deep moat with a
large embankment outside it and it can be

700
00:41:19,871 --> 00:41:23,410
circular, it can be square, and in
the UK and other parts of Europe,

701
00:41:23,411 --> 00:41:27,250
it often contains stone circles,
megalithic stone circles as well.

702
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,290
But the Henge itself is
entirely an earthwork.

703
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,680
What we find in the Amazon are thousands
of that are now beginning to emerge

704
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:38,540
from the cleared area of the jungle and
others that have been identified for the

705
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:42,260
first time with Lidar, lidar technology
is being employed in the Amazon.

706
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:45,860
It's nondestructive. You can see what's
under the trees. What does lidar,

707
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:50,460
light imaging and detective radar, they
mounts laser beams down into the jungle.

708
00:41:50,461 --> 00:41:52,910
This whole pattern of them,
you need helicopters and they they,

709
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:56,660
but it doesn't damage the rain forest
and you can strip away and see what's,

710
00:41:56,661 --> 00:41:59,150
see what's there.
And if this is too much of that diversion.

711
00:41:59,151 --> 00:42:03,470
Let me give you the example of Guatemala.
Guatemala is a small country,

712
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,670
if I remember correctly.

713
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:08,730
It's not much more than a hundred
thousand square kilometers in size. Um,

714
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:13,690
it is filled with intriguing Mayan ruins.
Everybody has heard of teacol.

715
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,543
Carl,

716
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:18,140
what archaeal just didn't know was that
literally within walking distance of

717
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:21,350
teacol surrounding that whole area,

718
00:42:21,351 --> 00:42:24,530
we're more than 60,000 structures
that they hadn't identified.

719
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:29,590
And these have all been identified by
lidar in a country that's just a hundred

720
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,583
thousand kilometers in area.

721
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,940
So you'll have to ask yourself in that
five and a half million square kilometers

722
00:42:34,941 --> 00:42:38,540
of the Amazon, if lidar technology
could be applied comprehensively,

723
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,330
what would we find beneath there?

724
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:46,600
And the evidence already is extremely
tempting and extremely tantalizing and I'm

725
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:50,510
intrigued by these huge
geometrical figures, uh,

726
00:42:50,511 --> 00:42:55,511
which involve primarily a circles and
squares and they are classic hinges in the

727
00:42:56,751 --> 00:43:00,890
sense that they are deep ditches
surrounded by huge embankments.

728
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,860
They're extremely geometrical.
For example,

729
00:43:03,861 --> 00:43:08,630
you can find an octagon surrounding a
square at a place called Jacko sa in the

730
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:13,130
Amazon. You can find a square
perfectly in closing a circle.

731
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:17,510
Now that is an exercise called squaring
the circle that are archaea are our

732
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,550
academics have given to the Greeks.

733
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:22,460
They said the Greeks were the first
person people who perform that exercise.

734
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:26,270
But now we find in dated sites in the
Amazon that this was being done in the

735
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:28,490
Amazon long before the Greeks.
What are the dates?

736
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,420
The earliest dates that have been found
in these sites now are about three and a

737
00:43:32,421 --> 00:43:35,090
half thousand years old,
about three and a half thousand years old.

738
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:38,450
But the evidence is that the
sites have been constantly remade.

739
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:43,510
And what intrigues me is what remains
in that five and a half million square

740
00:43:44,241 --> 00:43:47,210
kilometers that has not been
investigated yet. We are just,

741
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:49,370
I think looking at the edges of a mystery,

742
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:54,620
the archeologists involved to a mainly
from Finland and also from Brazil feel

743
00:43:54,621 --> 00:43:55,431
the same.
They're,

744
00:43:55,431 --> 00:43:58,580
their estimate is that there are thousands
of these structures remaining in the

745
00:43:58,581 --> 00:44:03,470
jungle and they're open as to how old
they may ultimately prove to be the

746
00:44:03,471 --> 00:44:04,910
investigation needs to be done.

747
00:44:04,911 --> 00:44:09,911
But what's fascinating about them is this
very powerful geometry and astronomy.

748
00:44:10,341 --> 00:44:14,090
So a number of the sites are perfectly
aligned to true north, true south,

749
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:17,060
true east and true West.
I'm not talking about magnetic north,

750
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:19,820
I'm talking about true
astronomical Doulas to do that.

751
00:44:19,821 --> 00:44:22,640
There's only one way to do it. And
that's with, uh, with astronomy.

752
00:44:22,641 --> 00:44:25,280
So that tells us that astronomers
were at work in the Amazon.

753
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,820
The geometry is very
complex and very precise.

754
00:44:28,821 --> 00:44:31,920
That tells us that people with geometrical
skills, we're working in the Amazon.

755
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:35,010
And thirdly, the scale of the
sites of hundreds of meters,

756
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,590
gigantic earthworks on the
scale of hundreds of meters,

757
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:42,540
tells us that this was highly organized
project that was undertaken on a very

758
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:44,520
large scale by very
large numbers of people.

759
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:48,720
It's a wonderful mystery and
it deserves much further,

760
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:52,170
much further attention. And I'm,
I'm, yeah, that's Jacko sa. Exactly.

761
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,910
The squares squaring the circle,

762
00:44:53,911 --> 00:44:58,911
so you can see the outside embankment
and then inside it is the square ditch.

763
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:03,150
And then there's another embankment inside
that and a circle and a circle inside

764
00:45:03,151 --> 00:45:03,280
there.

765
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,250
Crazy. They made a road right through
that modern road. Yeah. You know, because,

766
00:45:07,251 --> 00:45:10,100
because there's no respect for,
there's no respect for the ancient,

767
00:45:10,101 --> 00:45:14,330
for the ancient world, unfortunately. And
there's another one look at that. Wow,

768
00:45:14,331 --> 00:45:17,060
that's incredible.
So that there are thousands of the sound,

769
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:19,760
the stuff that they found in the Amazon.

770
00:45:19,761 --> 00:45:22,340
What imaging technology
were they using to find

771
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,680
all initially,

772
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:27,640
initially it was entirely found because
areas of the rain forest had been

773
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:31,210
cleared. Economic interests said,
we want to make a cattle ranch here,

774
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,130
or we want to make a soy bean farm here.

775
00:45:33,131 --> 00:45:34,990
So we're just gonna clear the rain forest.

776
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,790
In the process of
clearing the rain forest,

777
00:45:36,791 --> 00:45:40,150
they start discovering these earthworks
that had previously been completely

778
00:45:40,151 --> 00:45:44,150
overgrown by the jungle. Then
the next step was to say, uh,

779
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,410
what can we, what can we do
to find out more about this?

780
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,080
Obviously they don't want
to destroy more jungle.

781
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,680
And Luckily we have a technology which
is, which is Lidar, as I mentioned,

782
00:45:53,681 --> 00:45:57,820
which uses radar and using lidar.
They'd been identified,

783
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:02,410
able to identify many more of these sites
and then to get to the sites without

784
00:46:02,411 --> 00:46:07,180
destroying the jungle and
to begin excavations on them
and to find that they go

785
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:10,480
back in the cases of the ones
that have been explored so far,

786
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:15,100
at least 3000 years. Uh, this
is an intriguing development,

787
00:46:15,101 --> 00:46:18,070
completely unexplained in our
understanding of the Amazon.

788
00:46:18,071 --> 00:46:22,420
And what it suggests is a heritage
of extremely ancient knowledge.

789
00:46:22,421 --> 00:46:24,370
You don't wake up one
morning and you know,

790
00:46:24,371 --> 00:46:29,170
create a perfectly geometrical square
or circular earthwork that's perfectly

791
00:46:29,171 --> 00:46:32,500
aligned to true north, south, east
and West on an enormous scale.

792
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:35,170
That has to be a background to that.
That'd be a reason for doing it.

793
00:46:35,171 --> 00:46:38,080
And the evidence is none of these sites
were lived in. There's no habitation,

794
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,890
a refuse found in them
whatsoever. They were, they,

795
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,320
we don't know what they were used for.

796
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:49,380
I make the case in America before that
they're connected to a system of ideas

797
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:52,510
which has found all around the world,
which,

798
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:55,720
which has to do with
death and the afterlife,

799
00:46:55,721 --> 00:47:00,370
destiny of the soul. Uh, and I
go into the issue of Iowasca,

800
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:03,930
uh, in, in this book because
I, first of all, I was,

801
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,250
is itself another example of
Amazonian Science. Um, as you and I,

802
00:47:09,251 --> 00:47:12,730
and many of the listeners
and viewers know, uh,

803
00:47:12,731 --> 00:47:16,750
the active ingredient of Iowasca
is DMT dimethyltryptamine,

804
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,880
but dimethyltryptamine is not
normally accessible through the gut.

805
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,710
We have to smoke it or,

806
00:47:23,711 --> 00:47:28,711
or vape it to get that rocket ship to
the other side of reality and journey.

807
00:47:29,531 --> 00:47:33,070
Last Swat 10, 12 minutes. Not
much more than that. Sometimes,

808
00:47:33,071 --> 00:47:34,840
sometimes quite a lot less.

809
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:39,520
What [inaudible] does is it makes
DMT available through the gut.

810
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,850
The reason it's not available through
the gutters because of an enzyme in the

811
00:47:42,851 --> 00:47:44,620
gut called monoamine oxidase.

812
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:49,330
And that switches off DMT on contact,
the Iowasca Vine,

813
00:47:49,331 --> 00:47:51,880
which is one of the two
ingredients of the IOWASCA brew.

814
00:47:51,881 --> 00:47:54,610
The other ingredient is
leaves that contain DMT.

815
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,240
The IOWASCA vine contains a
monoamine oxidase inhibitor,

816
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:03,570
which switches off the enzyme in the
gut and allows the DMT to be accessed to

817
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:04,570
orally,

818
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:08,890
which produces a rather different journey
from the smoked or vaped DMT trip.

819
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,230
It's a much longer journey.
It's four or five hours.

820
00:48:11,231 --> 00:48:12,610
It allows you to integrate and to,

821
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:16,330
and to interrelate with the strange
landscapes in which you find yourself

822
00:48:16,331 --> 00:48:19,000
amongst and the entities
that you encounter.

823
00:48:19,001 --> 00:48:21,880
I'm not making any claims about the
reality status of those entities,

824
00:48:21,881 --> 00:48:23,710
but what I am saying,
and it's a fact,

825
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:28,330
is that people who work with DMT and
Iowaska do encounter what they construe to

826
00:48:28,331 --> 00:48:31,510
be entities, uh, who, who
communicate with them intelligently.

827
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:36,700
So somebody in the Amazon out of 150,000
different species of plants and trees

828
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:41,530
selected too that are not psychoactive
on their own. But when put together,

829
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:45,740
create an extraordinary visionary brew,
uh,

830
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:50,710
Iowasca means the vine of the dead
and what it's connected to, uh,

831
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:55,220
in South American religious
and spiritual thinking, uh,

832
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:59,590
is what happens to us
when we die. Uh, and, uh,

833
00:48:59,591 --> 00:49:04,210
the Takano who are an Amazonian people
who work regularly with Iowa Ska,

834
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:08,740
I mean the Tucano actually will give a
teaspoon full of Iowa Asca to a newborn

835
00:49:08,741 --> 00:49:09,310
infant.

836
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:13,870
They feel I was so important that there
is a hidden realm around us which we are

837
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:16,330
not normally aware of and
we need to be aware of it.

838
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:21,190
And I ask it as an important part of that.
In there I'll ask a journeys,

839
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:25,690
the Takano schamens experience visions
and they will then come back to an ilit

840
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,940
normal problem solving
state of consciousness.

841
00:49:27,941 --> 00:49:30,880
And they will paint and depict their
visions. And what's intriguing,

842
00:49:30,881 --> 00:49:32,140
and I go into it in the book,

843
00:49:32,141 --> 00:49:35,350
is the quite a number of the Takano
paintings of the other world,

844
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:40,120
of the afterlife realm of the entrance
to the other world are geometrical and

845
00:49:40,121 --> 00:49:42,700
they look exactly like the geog lifts.

846
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:46,870
So I'm beginning to wonder whether these
geoglyphs we're part of a system of

847
00:49:46,871 --> 00:49:51,871
spiritual ideas concerning what happens
to us after death and what we need to do

848
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:56,530
in this life to ensure a beneficial
outcome. And oddly enough,

849
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:01,030
that same system of ideas is found in
the Mississippi valley, in the Amazon.

850
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,530
It involves,
uh,

851
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:06,370
particularly Iowasca and the belief that
the Iowaska journey takes you to the

852
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:10,750
afterlife realm and a journey along the
milky way in the Mississippi Valley.

853
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:14,530
Um, the mound builder sites up
and down the Mississippi Valley,

854
00:50:14,531 --> 00:50:17,050
particularly Mountville in Alabama,

855
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,310
exactly the same system of religious
ideas associated with geometrical

856
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:24,340
constructions that on death the soul,

857
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:28,610
they're very specific ascends to the
constellation of Orion transits from the

858
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:32,600
constellation of Orion to the Milky Way
makes a journey along the Milky Way,

859
00:50:32,601 --> 00:50:37,601
which they call the path of souls and
encounters challenges and ordeals where

860
00:50:37,761 --> 00:50:40,820
the soul must account for
the life that it has lived.

861
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,980
Then we got to Egypt and what do we find?
The same system of ideas.

862
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,340
The soul must rise up to
the constellation of Orion.

863
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:52,910
There's a narrow shaft cut through the
southern side of the Great Pyramid of

864
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:56,510
Giza, which targets directly the lowest
of the three stars of Orion's belt,

865
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:00,170
widely the accepted as a
star shaft or a sole shaft.

866
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:04,040
The soul would rise up through that shaft,
get to the Constellation of Orion,

867
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:05,930
which stands by the
banks of the Milky Way,

868
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,760
and would then transit to the Milky Way,

869
00:51:07,761 --> 00:51:10,130
which the ancient Egyptians
called the winding waterway.

870
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:14,450
And it would make a journey along the
milky way where it would be confronted by

871
00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:18,800
challenges and ordeals very similar idea
to the Takano very similar idea to the

872
00:51:18,801 --> 00:51:20,510
Mississippi valley as far as we know.

873
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:23,810
None of these cultures were in
contact with one another. Either.

874
00:51:23,811 --> 00:51:26,300
We're dealing with a huge,
unbelievable,

875
00:51:26,301 --> 00:51:31,130
extraordinarily detailed coincidence
involving architecture and ideas.

876
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:35,450
Or we're looking at the legacy that
was inherited in all of these different

877
00:51:35,451 --> 00:51:38,060
places from a remote common ancestor.
And,

878
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,650
and I believe that that's
what we're looking at.

879
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:43,520
What do we think the people from the
ancient Mississippi Valley, that culture,

880
00:51:43,521 --> 00:51:47,170
what do we think they were using if they
weren't using Iowasca or do we think

881
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,750
that that's what they were
using? Well, that's, that's,

882
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,160
that's an interesting question.
Whether,

883
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:56,540
whether visionary substances are the
only way to get into altered states of

884
00:51:56,541 --> 00:52:01,340
consciousness. And, and, uh, I
would say they are definitely not a,

885
00:52:01,341 --> 00:52:03,530
of course there are visionary
substances which are,

886
00:52:03,531 --> 00:52:07,310
which are used in native American
vision, vision quests. I've, I've,

887
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:11,360
I've had the privilege of Payoti ceremony,
uh,

888
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:14,800
with the native American church. I've
never done that. What does that look like?

889
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:18,210
I loved it actually. I thought, I
thought it was, I thought it was amazing.

890
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:22,940
It doesn't overpower you in the way that
DMT or Iowaska does. Uh, it's, it's,

891
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:24,380
it's much gentler.
It's much more,

892
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:27,620
you feel much more integrated and
connected with, with, with nature.

893
00:52:27,621 --> 00:52:30,650
Your thought processes are
quite, quite clear. It felt,

894
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,990
it felt just like a very
beautiful and healing experience.

895
00:52:32,991 --> 00:52:36,050
And I loved the ceremony that I'm in.
I'm inside a teepee with,

896
00:52:36,051 --> 00:52:38,050
with 30 or 40 other people and that there,

897
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,600
there are specific roles that are assigned
to those different individuals. One,

898
00:52:41,601 --> 00:52:44,150
we'll keep the door,
another will be responsible for the fire,

899
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:47,930
which is a work of art in itself. Just
gazing into that fire and the glowing,

900
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:52,430
the glowing embers is enough to induce
an altered state of consciousness on its

901
00:52:52,431 --> 00:52:54,520
own. Incredible drumming, which,

902
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:58,670
which drives your state of consciousness
into a kind of peak peak experience.

903
00:52:58,671 --> 00:53:03,671
This is a technology for accessing other
levels of experience and other levels

904
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,001
of reality.

905
00:53:05,001 --> 00:53:09,110
And it's clear that the native Americans
had a number of advanced technologies

906
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:13,400
in this area. The Sun dance doesn't
use a substance, but it uses austerity.

907
00:53:13,401 --> 00:53:16,280
It uses pain to drive an
altered state of consciousness.

908
00:53:16,281 --> 00:53:20,300
The objective in every case seems to be,
let's just for a while,

909
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,250
get ourselves out of the narrow,

910
00:53:22,251 --> 00:53:26,040
rigid frame of the Ilit problem solving
state of consciousness. We all need that.

911
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,120
It's incredibly useful.

912
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:30,630
Hunter gatherer is needed just as
much as people in cities need it,

913
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:34,290
but it's not the only state of
consciousness available to human beings.

914
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:38,520
And maybe that's one of the big mistakes
that we're making in our culture, um,

915
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:42,480
and was not made, uh, in,
in shamanistic societies

916
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:47,490
that that is a really
interesting breakdown that
maybe that is one of the big

917
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:50,640
mistakes we're making in our culture
when people point to the problems that we

918
00:53:50,641 --> 00:53:51,480
have in this country.

919
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:55,410
One of the problems we have is our
inability to connect with each other or to

920
00:53:55,411 --> 00:53:59,190
recognize that we're all sharing this
space and time together and instead

921
00:53:59,191 --> 00:54:04,191
wanting to uphold our own religious or
ideological ideas as being the only one

922
00:54:04,771 --> 00:54:07,050
way to get going. Yeah. The
only one way to get through.

923
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:11,070
And one of the things that I've found,
the psychedelic experiences,

924
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:15,890
it really makes ideologies seem,
uh,

925
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,340
if not preposterous,

926
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:20,940
at the very least insignificant in
comparison to human experiences.

927
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:26,080
The experience of,
of comradery and friendship and love it,

928
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:28,200
you realize like, oh,
this is what's important.

929
00:54:28,201 --> 00:54:33,201
This is really about not enforcing your
ideas are pushing them on other people

930
00:54:34,561 --> 00:54:37,170
and forcing people to behave
the way you behave. But instead

931
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:42,120
I'm thinking about religious ideas,
which caused so much division,

932
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:46,950
so much chaos, so much
hatred, so much fear, so much
suspicion in the world today.

933
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:53,060
Is it really what we want to do as human
beings simply to accept a package of

934
00:54:53,131 --> 00:54:57,780
ideas that were believed in by our
ancestors to accept them whole without

935
00:54:57,781 --> 00:54:59,820
question as absolute fact,

936
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:04,410
which we regard as such a Thursday to
fact that in some cases we're willing to

937
00:55:04,411 --> 00:55:08,220
be deeply unpleasant to people who hold
different views or perhaps even killed

938
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:11,430
him. Uh, we've had this, you know,
this recent event in, in, in,

939
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:16,431
in Sri Lanka or primarily a religiously
motivated terrorist event that happens.

940
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:21,030
It happens all over the world that people
feel so convinced that the inherited

941
00:55:21,031 --> 00:55:24,870
package of ideas that they had nothing
to do with creating and that they have

942
00:55:24,871 --> 00:55:28,140
never questioned. They're so
convinced that those ideas are right,

943
00:55:28,141 --> 00:55:32,160
that in extreme cases they are actually
prepared to kill other human beings who

944
00:55:32,161 --> 00:55:36,810
hold different ideas.
There are they so insecure in their own,

945
00:55:36,811 --> 00:55:40,650
in their own beliefs that that they're
prepared to go to that level of actually

946
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,730
murdering another human being.
Who else?

947
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,540
They're so threatened by the other
beliefs that other human beings hold.

948
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:48,900
So it's an abnegation of our
responsibility as human beings,

949
00:55:48,901 --> 00:55:50,370
we should be questioning things.

950
00:55:50,371 --> 00:55:53,290
We should not be accepting
packages of ideas intact,

951
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:57,810
fully formed and using them to drive
the way we behave towards one another.

952
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:01,140
That was part of the human story, but
we need to move on from that. I mean,

953
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:05,490
it's a very dangerous situation in a very
complex modern world with billions of

954
00:56:05,491 --> 00:56:09,030
human beings on the planet to have these
kinds of energy's being generated were

955
00:56:09,031 --> 00:56:10,290
certain groups of people are saying,

956
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:14,490
we are absolutely right and you are
absolutely wrong. We are superior.

957
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,780
You are inferior. This is a very,
very dangerous path that we're,

958
00:56:18,781 --> 00:56:21,750
that we're on and it needs to be changed.
Personally,

959
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:26,050
I know this is not a comment that
will go down well with many people,

960
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:29,110
but I am strongly opposed to nationalism.
I don't,

961
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:33,370
I don't see any virtue in nationalism.
It is an accident of birth,

962
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,720
which nation you were born in. It was
nothing that you did for your own merit.

963
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:42,460
You didn't earn that you were born by
accident in, in a particular nation.

964
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:46,750
Why should we automatically feel the
other people who were born by accident in

965
00:56:46,751 --> 00:56:49,570
that particular nation has
something special in common with us?

966
00:56:49,571 --> 00:56:52,600
And that we together are a group who are
much more important than other groups

967
00:56:52,601 --> 00:56:56,440
of people. I've been privileged to spend
my life traveling around the world,

968
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:59,290
living with communities all over,
over the world.

969
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:02,180
And one thing that really
comes across to me strongly,

970
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,640
it should be a cliche and yet it's not,
is that we are all one family.

971
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:09,940
That humans are intimately
interconnected all around the world.

972
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:14,320
That you can go to the remotest area
of the Amazon jungle and find the same

973
00:57:14,321 --> 00:57:18,970
hopes, the same fears, the same dreams
that we have in industrialized cities,

974
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:22,060
shared by the hunter gatherers in
the, in, in the middle of the Amazon.

975
00:57:22,061 --> 00:57:27,061
So our similarities as human beings and
what we share in common at the emotional

976
00:57:27,641 --> 00:57:31,960
level and the level of love and at the
level of heart are far more important

977
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:35,650
than our differences that are defined
by the nation or the political group in

978
00:57:35,651 --> 00:57:40,090
which we in which we grew up in. And when
I, when I say I'm against nationalism,

979
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,880
I need also to make
clear that does not mean,

980
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:47,350
and I hope I'm not taking out of context
by others who are listening to this.

981
00:57:47,351 --> 00:57:52,090
That does not mean I'm in favor of
world government. I detest governments.

982
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:56,170
That's another thing we need to grow out
of. We don't need governments anymore.

983
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:00,220
If we have them, they should have
a very minimal role in our society.

984
00:58:00,221 --> 00:58:04,810
I think it's possible for the human race
to relate as one family without leaders

985
00:58:04,811 --> 00:58:08,380
and governments who are exploiting
the worst aspects of our character,

986
00:58:08,381 --> 00:58:10,630
the lowest common
denominator of our society.

987
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:14,710
Deliberately encouraging theaters and
hatreds and suspicions what responsible

988
00:58:14,711 --> 00:58:19,711
leaders should be doing is encouraging
love and unity and their failure to do

989
00:58:20,021 --> 00:58:21,520
that,
in my view,

990
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,330
disqualifies them from the
leadership role entirely.

991
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,000
And that's why I've
often said I would not,

992
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:32,950
I would like to see a situation in which
no head of state can be appointed to

993
00:58:32,951 --> 00:58:37,080
that position unless he or she has
first had 12 sessions of Iowasca.

994
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:39,520
That would be the condition.

995
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:44,470
Don't even bother applying for the job
if you haven't done that and we have to

996
00:58:44,471 --> 00:58:46,180
be there where you have
it and we have to be,

997
00:58:46,181 --> 00:58:51,040
we want to see that you're drinking
every drop and we wanted an experience

998
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:53,680
Sharman presence who's really
going to guide you through the,

999
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:54,341
through the journey.

1000
00:58:54,341 --> 00:58:58,420
And I suspect that that would be a
transformative experience for many of our

1001
00:58:58,421 --> 00:59:02,650
political class and that they would start
to question why they do what they do,

1002
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:06,220
why they exploit fears in order
to magnify their own position.

1003
00:59:06,221 --> 00:59:09,130
They'd start to question that and to
wonder about a different destiny for

1004
00:59:09,131 --> 00:59:11,340
humanity. But that's a dream. I
guess it's not going to happen.

1005
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:14,370
Very, very, very well said
and I couldn't agree more.

1006
00:59:14,371 --> 00:59:17,940
My hope is that what you were saying and
what we were discussing earlier about

1007
00:59:17,941 --> 00:59:22,070
how the Internet is sort of a roaded
our faith in many institutions

1008
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:27,280
as being the only or the primary source
of knowledge that I hope that that takes

1009
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:31,370
place globally in terms of the
way we view government. Yeah.

1010
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:33,740
And that we do that your idea of like,

1011
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:38,630
I love what America stands for and what
America stands for is kind of a nation.

1012
00:59:38,631 --> 00:59:42,380
That's where people go to,
you know,

1013
00:59:42,381 --> 00:59:47,381
this is one of the more insidious problems
with this idea of building walls and

1014
00:59:47,811 --> 00:59:50,510
keeping people out and making it
incredibly difficult to get here.

1015
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:54,600
The reason why I'm here is cause it
was pretty easy to get here. Yeah.

1016
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:57,740
That's why I'm here. That's,
that's the essence of America.

1017
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,730
A free and open society come here and do
better. That's the whole idea behind it.

1018
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:06,680
I would hope that this
idea of being able to just,

1019
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:10,490
if you want to do manner that
you can anywhere in the world,

1020
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:14,450
this could eventually spread
out. Yes. This is my hope.

1021
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:19,410
I believe it can spread out and, and um,
you know, I see many signs of hope, uh,

1022
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:24,140
in, in, in America. Uh, America
has become a big part of my life,

1023
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:26,000
not just because I wrote this book,

1024
01:00:26,001 --> 01:00:29,360
but because I have children
who are now living in America.

1025
01:00:29,361 --> 01:00:31,980
I have a son and daughter in law who,
who live in La.

1026
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:35,950
I have another son and daughter in
law who live in Boston. America. I'm,

1027
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:36,531
I'm British.

1028
01:00:36,531 --> 01:00:40,310
But America has become a very central
part of my life and it's a fascinating and

1029
01:00:40,311 --> 01:00:44,360
amazing country and it's been my privilege
to travel thousands of miles across

1030
01:00:44,361 --> 01:00:48,230
America, across many, many,
many different states. And I,
I love this country. It's a,

1031
01:00:48,231 --> 01:00:50,030
it's a,
it's an amazing place.

1032
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:53,780
Only in America could we see happening.

1033
01:00:53,781 --> 01:00:57,410
What has happened with cannabis,
you know, then the fact that at a,

1034
01:00:57,411 --> 01:01:02,180
at a local level, individuals have
got together, mobilized petitions,

1035
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:07,060
organized votes, and changed
the law, change the law. Diff,

1036
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:10,790
literally stuck a finger up at
central government and said, fuck off.

1037
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:12,560
This is none of your business.

1038
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:16,790
What I do with my consciousness in the
inner sanctum of my own life is not the

1039
01:01:16,791 --> 01:01:19,600
business of the state. That's
a very American feeling. It's,

1040
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:22,820
it's something that you don't find often
in other countries where the state is

1041
01:01:22,821 --> 01:01:26,690
granted much more power and much more
authority than it perhaps should be.

1042
01:01:26,691 --> 01:01:31,691
Americans are naturally questioning
of government authority and that has,

1043
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,090
that is what has led to the,
uh,

1044
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:36,800
legalization increasingly
legalization of cannabis,

1045
01:01:36,801 --> 01:01:39,230
which is going to change
the world in lots of ways.

1046
01:01:39,231 --> 01:01:42,020
But then ironically at the same time,

1047
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:47,630
see the thing about democracies is
that in order to get things done in a

1048
01:01:50,151 --> 01:01:53,000
democracy, you need to persuade
people of your point of view.

1049
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:55,550
So information becomes very important in,

1050
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,860
in democracies and
information can be abused,

1051
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:59,900
people can be misled with information.

1052
01:01:59,901 --> 01:02:03,710
They can be told that what they're
receiving is the truth, whereas in fact,

1053
01:02:03,711 --> 01:02:04,544
it's not the truth.

1054
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:08,600
And you can end up with a
kind of dictatorship that
the people have given their

1055
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:11,660
ascent to on the basis of, of
false information. And frankly,

1056
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:14,690
I'd rather have a real dictatorship,
which is, which is out in the open.

1057
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:19,780
And clear rather than one that has
been subtly manipulated into through

1058
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:20,610
manipulating

1059
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:23,610
the, the, the, the views
of the, of, of the voters.

1060
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:28,290
But I am and remain enormously
encouraged by America.

1061
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:29,790
It may seem like a trivial issue,

1062
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:34,260
but the fact that state by state
cannabis is being legalized and that is

1063
01:02:34,261 --> 01:02:38,790
resulting from a grass roots movement
that this enormous change has been made

1064
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:41,580
either. It's ironic, it's strange
that at the federal level,

1065
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:46,350
even though what eight states now
totally legal for recreational, uh, 23,

1066
01:02:46,351 --> 01:02:49,770
24 states, legal, legal for medical
use, that at the federal level,

1067
01:02:49,771 --> 01:02:51,840
it's still a schedule one controlled,
controlled drug.

1068
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:55,710
This is a huge state of dissonance that
exists in America is going to have to

1069
01:02:55,711 --> 01:02:59,610
put it right. What it says to me
is that people can change things,

1070
01:02:59,611 --> 01:03:03,360
people can get together at the local
level and they can make a better world

1071
01:03:03,361 --> 01:03:06,720
because there's no doubt that the cannabis
laws were vicious and wrong and cruel

1072
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:10,620
and evil and ruined people's lives for,
for decades.

1073
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:13,710
And it's people who've changed that
it's not government has changed,

1074
01:03:13,711 --> 01:03:16,230
that it's the people at the grassroots
level in America is a country where that

1075
01:03:16,231 --> 01:03:17,510
can happen. And I, I,

1076
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:22,230
I remain encouraged about about the role
of the American people while often in

1077
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:24,720
despair about the role
of the American state.

1078
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:26,530
Yeah, I'm encouraged
as well. And you know,

1079
01:03:26,531 --> 01:03:28,990
it's interesting Ben and Jerry
release something yesterday,

1080
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:31,300
which is really our on four 20,
I should say,

1081
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:36,720
which was talking about the drug laws
in this country and talking about how

1082
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,860
many, it's really, really
opening this, the, uh,

1083
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:45,370
the idea of like how unjust these laws
were and how many of these laws targeted

1084
01:03:45,371 --> 01:03:50,080
people of color and how many people who
are white people have profited off of

1085
01:03:50,081 --> 01:03:55,081
this and how many people are still in
jail for crimes that they committed,

1086
01:03:55,661 --> 01:03:58,630
you know,
air quote crimes that are no longer crime,

1087
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,930
that are no longer crime and this
is ridiculous. And then these,

1088
01:04:01,931 --> 01:04:03,490
these records should be expunged.

1089
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:07,270
I see that California has made
some steps in that direction.

1090
01:04:07,271 --> 01:04:10,940
There has been some expunging of course.
Well, we can only hope that also what,

1091
01:04:10,941 --> 01:04:15,640
what opens up next is silicide been, is
now going to be on the ballot. Absolutely.

1092
01:04:15,641 --> 01:04:19,360
And when that opens up, I mean what you
really think marijuana is a gateway drug?

1093
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:22,410
Well guess what it is if
silicide been gets in. Yes.

1094
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:26,680
Because silicide can legitimately
changed the world. It really,

1095
01:04:26,681 --> 01:04:29,290
I mean I think marijuana can change
the world and I really do think that

1096
01:04:29,291 --> 01:04:33,670
cannabis has changing people's perceptions
and making people more calm and

1097
01:04:33,671 --> 01:04:37,630
friendly and yeah, and even the,
what they talk about with paranoia.

1098
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:38,890
I welcome that.

1099
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:43,080
And the reason why welcome that is I
think people are entirely too cocky. The,

1100
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:47,950
the life we live as bizarre as you
could ever imagine a book and we're just

1101
01:04:47,951 --> 01:04:50,740
accustomed to it because it's
our day to day for granted.

1102
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:56,140
Marijuana removes those blinders and it
really makes you understand that this is

1103
01:04:56,141 --> 01:04:58,870
a strange, strange life. And these,

1104
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:03,970
a lot of these pitfalls and problems that
we have in our society are due to fear

1105
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:07,270
and they're due to ignorance and their,
their due to this,

1106
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,280
this lack of connection with each other.

1107
01:05:09,281 --> 01:05:12,040
And cannabis and many of
these other psychedelic drugs,

1108
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:15,160
they encourage this connection
with each other, which is,

1109
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:16,170
I think what we need need.

1110
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,470
It's, it's, it's certainly
what we need and, and,

1111
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,180
and it's an aberration in human culture
that we've created a society that

1112
01:05:22,181 --> 01:05:25,930
demonize these substances and that made
them illegal is it's a relatively recent

1113
01:05:25,931 --> 01:05:28,810
thing. It's really just the last, the
last hundred years. It's, uh, it's,

1114
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:32,890
it's a tiny part of the human story and
yet we were so arrogant as a society

1115
01:05:32,891 --> 01:05:37,600
that we could set aside thousands of years
of human tradition and experience and

1116
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:40,780
wisdom working with the plant medicines.
We just set it aside,

1117
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,290
turn them into criminal substances
and say, we know everything. What a,

1118
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:47,870
what a huge and stupid mistake that is,
um,

1119
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:51,940
on cannabis as a quote
unquote gateway drug.

1120
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:56,830
It absolutely is in this sense that the
legalization of cannabis is going to

1121
01:05:56,831 --> 01:06:00,700
open the doors to, as you, as you say,
to the legalization of, of psychedelics.

1122
01:06:00,701 --> 01:06:05,080
Because what's happening is that the
population is completely waking up to the

1123
01:06:05,081 --> 01:06:10,081
fact that they have been bullshitted
and lied to about cannabis for the best

1124
01:06:10,241 --> 01:06:14,170
part of a century.
And once that dawns on people,

1125
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:18,250
the realization at a direct, personal
level, here's this herb I love.

1126
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:20,080
I have been lied to,

1127
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:25,150
systematically misinformed by
central government, uh, about this,

1128
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:29,230
about this herb that leads to questioning
of everything that central government

1129
01:06:29,231 --> 01:06:33,130
does. And so in that sense, it is
a gateway to a questioning society.

1130
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:37,680
The psychedelics are different
in that, in that Psilocybin, um,

1131
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:40,750
actually does lead you to question stuff.

1132
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:44,770
It leads you to really ask
questions about, about everything,

1133
01:06:44,771 --> 01:06:47,110
about your role in the world,
about you as a person,

1134
01:06:47,111 --> 01:06:50,680
about how you relate to other people and
about the whole system on this planet

1135
01:06:50,681 --> 01:06:53,680
and the beautiful,
gorgeous planet that we,

1136
01:06:53,681 --> 01:06:57,760
that we have and what we're doing to it.
That that also enters, enters awareness.

1137
01:06:57,761 --> 01:07:00,820
So it erodes confidence and authority.
And it also roads,

1138
01:07:00,821 --> 01:07:04,000
confidence and authority that doesn't
have experiences that you've experienced.

1139
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:07,420
That's the part of the problem is that
these people that are holding people back

1140
01:07:07,421 --> 01:07:10,940
from these psychedelic
experiences, they've never had
them. They've never had it.

1141
01:07:10,941 --> 01:07:12,940
They don't even know
what they're rallying.

1142
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:15,830
That coming to it from a place
of fear and prejudice, uh,

1143
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:19,420
there's simply accepting stuff that they'd
been told without really thinking it

1144
01:07:19,421 --> 01:07:23,050
through [inaudible] and examining
it. And again, it's a failure of,

1145
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:26,230
of what human beings should,
should be doing. We have to get,

1146
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:29,730
we have to get rid of this fear and
ironically it's bad for them as well.

1147
01:07:29,731 --> 01:07:32,680
It's bad for the people that
are actually encouraging this,

1148
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:35,500
these laws to be enforced.
Yes, it's bad for,

1149
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:39,980
it's bad for the whole of the whole of
society because it is healthy for a,

1150
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,330
for a society where adults
become self realized,

1151
01:07:43,331 --> 01:07:48,250
individuals where they make their own
responsible choices about their own lives,

1152
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:51,730
where they don't say, oh, government
must make this choice for me.

1153
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:54,310
That's the next step for humanity.
We start,

1154
01:07:54,311 --> 01:07:59,311
we need to start becoming our own leaders
and making our own choices and that

1155
01:07:59,801 --> 01:08:03,820
is, that is what's being revealed now that
we're getting to the skull beneath the

1156
01:08:03,821 --> 01:08:05,410
smile of the war on drugs.

1157
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:10,180
We are realizing that it's part of a
big program of lying that has been about

1158
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:14,080
keeping people's minds closed down,
not wanting free thinking.

1159
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:15,680
I've made this point several times,

1160
01:08:15,681 --> 01:08:19,250
but our society is not against altered
states of consciousness as such.

1161
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:24,080
Our society will allow big Pharma to
make billions of dollars with drugs that

1162
01:08:24,081 --> 01:08:28,370
alter consciousness like Ciroc,
satin, Prozac, antidepressants,
which in my opinion,

1163
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:32,420
having had some experience of them are
amongst the most horrible drugs on the

1164
01:08:32,421 --> 01:08:35,510
planet. They are very
harmful, very dangerous drugs,

1165
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:38,660
but they're completely legal and they're
encouraged with our system. Likewise,

1166
01:08:38,661 --> 01:08:41,990
alcohol, very dangerous
drug causes, fights,

1167
01:08:41,991 --> 01:08:45,170
causes drunk driving accidents,
leads to cirrhosis of the liver,

1168
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:46,960
completely legal and open.
Uh,

1169
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:50,090
society is not against altered
states of consciousness as such.

1170
01:08:50,091 --> 01:08:53,330
It's against particular kinds of altered
states of consciousness that lead to

1171
01:08:53,331 --> 01:08:57,830
questioning of the existing
control system. That's what's,

1172
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:02,120
that's what's going on here, here,
here. Well said. And as you know,

1173
01:09:02,121 --> 01:09:05,740
I have my own story with, uh,
with, with cannabis. Well,

1174
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:08,780
you and I had a moment.
We had a moment which was,

1175
01:09:08,781 --> 01:09:11,270
which was quite a life changing
moment for me because I,

1176
01:09:11,271 --> 01:09:15,380
if I may just rehearse a little
bit of this for the audience. Um,

1177
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:20,240
in 2011, I had a series
of Iowasca sessions, uh,

1178
01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:25,000
in which it was shown to me that I was
using cannabis completely wrong, uh,

1179
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:28,970
that it had become a dominant force
in my life, that it was making me,

1180
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:31,940
you're speaking about paranoia.
And I agree with your paranoia is a,

1181
01:09:31,941 --> 01:09:34,010
is a useful thing if only to overcome it.

1182
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:36,680
That it was making me paranoid that
it was making me suspicious that I

1183
01:09:36,681 --> 01:09:39,680
approached everybody around
me in a state of suspicion.

1184
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,210
And I was shown this by Iowasca
and given a very strong message,

1185
01:09:44,211 --> 01:09:45,950
you need to quit cannabis.

1186
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:50,990
What I didn't realize at the time is
that the problem was not cannabis.

1187
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,300
The problem was me,
uh,

1188
01:09:53,301 --> 01:09:57,320
that I needed to fix those aspects of
myself before I could have a proper

1189
01:09:57,321 --> 01:10:00,140
relationship with cannabis.
So after that IOWASCA session,

1190
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:04,940
having smoked cannabis for decades,
literally 16 hours a day,

1191
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:06,770
seven days a week,
I quit.

1192
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:11,300
I quit for three years and then
I'm on your show and we're sitting,

1193
01:10:11,330 --> 01:10:15,040
we're sitting opposite. But in others we
are now, and you asked me a question, um,

1194
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:17,750
are you still off the cannabis
and that? And I say, well,

1195
01:10:17,751 --> 01:10:19,610
I'm thinking of dipping
my toes back in the water,

1196
01:10:19,611 --> 01:10:24,050
at which point you produce a
joint and we smoke it together.

1197
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:29,420
First of all, after three years, your
tolerance is way down on cannabis.

1198
01:10:29,421 --> 01:10:32,750
So I got really stoned.
I did listen to that interview back in.

1199
01:10:32,751 --> 01:10:35,570
Somehow I held it together
together brilliantly.

1200
01:10:35,571 --> 01:10:39,560
You opened up and there was like a wave
of information came pouring out of you.

1201
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:42,110
It was wonderful.
It was a liberation for me.

1202
01:10:42,111 --> 01:10:45,710
And what it said to me is it's
time to go back to cannabis,

1203
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,240
but perhaps in a different way,
it doesn't it.

1204
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,440
I need a different relationship
with his amazing medicine and,

1205
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:54,980
and if I can forge that, if I can make
that different relationship happen,

1206
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:57,890
then it can be a constructive
and positive part of my life.

1207
01:10:57,891 --> 01:11:01,250
And I can say definitely that that has
been the case and that's excellent.

1208
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:02,600
And so it's all thanks to you,
Joe.

1209
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:05,360
I probably would still be off cannabis
if it hadn't been for that joint. Well,

1210
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:09,710
I think people can develop these patterns
of behavior that are destructive with

1211
01:11:09,711 --> 01:11:14,430
anything, whether it's with alcohol or
cannabis or sex or anything. People get,

1212
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:18,720
they get in ruts. Yeah. You know, it
doesn't mean that the cannabis is bad.

1213
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:22,890
It means that you are on a bad
mental path. Yes. You know? I mean,

1214
01:11:22,891 --> 01:11:25,770
I'm not encouraging it for everybody
because some people are genuinely,

1215
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:28,970
biologically it doesn't jive
with them. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1216
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:33,120
The fundamental thing is we as adult
human beings need to take responsibility

1217
01:11:33,121 --> 01:11:35,490
for our own lives and our own decisions.

1218
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:39,960
And we need no Tom that responsibility
over to governmental institutions,

1219
01:11:39,961 --> 01:11:44,370
especially when it concerns something
as intimate and personal as our

1220
01:11:44,371 --> 01:11:45,910
consciousness. And, uh,

1221
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:50,690
my view is the ancient world had the
right attitude to this kind of thing and

1222
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,770
the modern world does not.

1223
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:56,580
And that we can sit down and learn
a lot from the ancient world.

1224
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:59,460
A lot of people ask me,
you know, handcuffed,

1225
01:11:59,461 --> 01:12:03,030
you've been arguing that there's a loss.
There's been a lost civilization in the,

1226
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:05,330
in the, in the human story. But what,

1227
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:09,300
what sort of civilization do you think it
was? Well, one of the things I think is,

1228
01:12:09,370 --> 01:12:11,340
was a civilization that use psychedelics.

1229
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:15,630
I think it was a civilization that
emerged from shamanism but did not stay at

1230
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:16,800
the hunter gatherer stage.

1231
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:20,610
But that took the essence of shamanism
and integrated it into a very different

1232
01:12:20,611 --> 01:12:24,420
kind of civilization from our, uh,
which pursued things in different ways.

1233
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:26,130
A lot of archeologists have said to me,

1234
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:29,760
but we don't find any plastic
bottles from the ice age.

1235
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:33,600
That means there was no
advanced civilization during
the Ice Age. Well hang on,

1236
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:36,960
maybe an advanced civilization might
have decided never to get involved in

1237
01:12:36,961 --> 01:12:38,310
plastic in the first place.

1238
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:41,190
Maybe they would have been a
clear choice not to make plastic.

1239
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:43,530
Maybe they did things in
completely different ways.

1240
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:49,100
Maybe they cultivated powers of the
human mind that we dismiss and regard as

1241
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:55,500
completely, completely unimportant.
You know, Woo Woo. Yeah.

1242
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:59,310
This is the thoughts about Egypt, correct?
It's about about Egypt and, and, and,

1243
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:00,210
and about other things.

1244
01:13:00,211 --> 01:13:05,211
I mean the specific example I give is
above the king's chamber in the Great

1245
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:12,500
Pyramid are five further chambers and
these chambers are rushed and floored with

1246
01:13:13,771 --> 01:13:18,771
granite beams that weigh about 70 tons
each and there are hundreds of them.

1247
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:22,890
And these 70 ton granite beams,
which to put in context,

1248
01:13:22,891 --> 01:13:27,891
a 70 ton beam is equivalent in weight to
35 large SUV loves these 70 ton granite

1249
01:13:28,861 --> 01:13:32,730
beams have been elevated to a height
of more than 350 feet above the ground.

1250
01:13:32,731 --> 01:13:36,480
And carefully and precisely
placed in position.

1251
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:41,490
It is very hard for archeologists
to explain how that was done.

1252
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:45,750
Using purely leverage mechanical
advantage, you can say, oh,

1253
01:13:45,751 --> 01:13:49,920
and perhaps they built a ramp and and,
and hold the stones up the ramp.

1254
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:52,530
But then you have to confront
basic laws of physics.

1255
01:13:52,531 --> 01:13:57,531
You can't hold a stone weighing tens of
tons up a slope that exceeds 10 degrees.

1256
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:01,350
Then you start doing the calculation.

1257
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:06,500
How long the ramp do I need with a 10
degree slope to get to 350 feet above the

1258
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:10,480
ground? And the answer is you
need a fucking long round, which,

1259
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:14,770
which should still be there because not
that it couldn't have been a sand ramp,

1260
01:14:14,771 --> 01:14:16,510
I would've collapsed under
the weight of those stones.

1261
01:14:16,511 --> 01:14:18,580
It had to be as massive
as the pyramid itself.

1262
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:22,300
So this begins to seem like
an absurd idea. The, the,

1263
01:14:22,301 --> 01:14:27,160
the idea that is foisted on
us by archeology may be the
idea that they regard as

1264
01:14:27,161 --> 01:14:31,780
absurd, namely that psychic powers were
cultivated by ancient civilizations,

1265
01:14:31,781 --> 01:14:35,140
that they could use powers of the human
mind that we have allowed to lapse.

1266
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:39,040
Maybe that idea deserves
further consideration. Um,

1267
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:42,310
we have gone down a path of
leverage and mechanical advantage.

1268
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,260
We used to relying on machines,

1269
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:49,450
but we hear anecdotal reports of people
who have telekinetic powers who can move

1270
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:52,390
things with their minds of people
who have telepathic powers on.

1271
01:14:52,391 --> 01:14:57,130
Our automatic reaction is to just dismiss
all of that because science says it's

1272
01:14:57,131 --> 01:14:58,570
impossible.
Um,

1273
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:03,600
B be B because a science regards
consciousnesses as local to the brain and

1274
01:15:03,671 --> 01:15:06,700
doesn't see how it can exert
itself, uh, outside of that.

1275
01:15:06,701 --> 01:15:09,640
But maybe we should open up to those
possibilities that we're dealing with a

1276
01:15:09,641 --> 01:15:13,420
very different kind of culture that
used techniques that we have allowed to

1277
01:15:13,421 --> 01:15:16,030
lapse. And maybe we could wake
those techniques up again.

1278
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:21,090
Maybe the ability of human beings to
do almost superhuman things is resident

1279
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,400
within all of us,
but sleeping

1280
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:28,050
well, it's pure speculation that they
use some sort of a telekinetic power,

1281
01:15:28,051 --> 01:15:29,490
but it's pure speculation,

1282
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:32,280
but it's absolute that they did
something that we don't understand.

1283
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,090
If you think about the distance
between us and the construction,

1284
01:15:36,091 --> 01:15:39,660
just the modern accepted construction
dates of the great pyramid.

1285
01:15:39,661 --> 01:15:42,930
It's more than 5,000 years ago
or close to 5,000 years ago.

1286
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:46,680
It's supposed to be about 4,500
years old. Yeah, that's really old.

1287
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:50,850
Incredibly incredible to think that
someone back then could do something that

1288
01:15:50,851 --> 01:15:55,440
would perplex us today with modern
machinery and that somehow or another,

1289
01:15:55,441 --> 01:15:56,340
they figured this out.

1290
01:15:56,341 --> 01:16:01,341
It's almost like what they had done
was leave behind something that was so

1291
01:16:01,621 --> 01:16:03,030
stupendous,

1292
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:08,300
so monstrously impressive that it would
transcend time and that you would have

1293
01:16:10,051 --> 01:16:14,610
to look at it even thousands and thousands
of years later and say, hey, like this,

1294
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:18,750
this defies conventional explanation.
This is not assemble.

1295
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:22,170
And I've seen some of the conventional
explanations of the construction of the

1296
01:16:22,171 --> 01:16:26,400
pyramid, and they conveniently neglect
those chambers above the king's chamber.

1297
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:29,520
They do. They conveniently neglect
a lot of those massive stones.

1298
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:33,720
And it's because it's, it's one of those
things you just go, oh, I don't know.

1299
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:36,510
What does this Jeremy, they're
the, they're the chairs

1300
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:37,431
about the above,

1301
01:16:37,431 --> 01:16:41,840
the above the king's chambers and each
one of those floors is consists of a row

1302
01:16:41,841 --> 01:16:46,841
of 70 ton granite blocks that had been
raised 350 feet above the ground and not

1303
01:16:47,181 --> 01:16:50,090
only that but brought from
Aswan in the south of Egypt,

1304
01:16:50,091 --> 01:16:52,580
500 kilometers south of the
south of the Great Pyramid.

1305
01:16:52,710 --> 01:16:57,570
If there's any time in history where you
could go in a time machine and go back

1306
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:59,190
and observe,
would that be the time?

1307
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:05,250
I am just completely fascinated
by the ice age at the moment.

1308
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:10,100
If you had one shot to go back and see
what it was like in some place, you

1309
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,110
wouldn't go to the construction
of the Great Pyramids.

1310
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:16,790
I think right now where I'd go is
12,800 years ago in the beginning of the

1311
01:17:16,791 --> 01:17:20,600
younger dryas just to see because I
think that's where the whole human story

1312
01:17:20,601 --> 01:17:21,230
changes.

1313
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:25,640
I think that's where we change tracks
from one path to another path and

1314
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:30,641
following those cataclysmic events of
the younger dryas between twelve thousand

1315
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:32,630
eight hundred and eleven thousand six
hundred years ago, following those,

1316
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:36,560
the signs of civilization that we see
emerging are not the beginnings of

1317
01:17:36,561 --> 01:17:41,561
civilization there a restarting of
civilization that had existed before the

1318
01:17:41,751 --> 01:17:45,110
cataclysm. And for that
reason, um, I would, uh,

1319
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:48,980
I would like to be present
during that cataclysmic event,

1320
01:17:48,981 --> 01:17:52,570
if only to satisfy myself that it was
indeed a comet. You see, the, the,

1321
01:17:52,571 --> 01:17:52,971
the one thing,

1322
01:17:52,971 --> 01:17:57,770
there's no dispute about any more is
that the younger dryas was a cataclysm,

1323
01:17:57,890 --> 01:18:02,210
the Yukon. They can't argue
about that. The, the, the,
the megafauna that, uh, that,

1324
01:18:02,211 --> 01:18:05,540
that die off, the disruption of human
activity that takes place at that time,

1325
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:06,770
the huge climate changes.

1326
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:10,940
This was a cataclysm by any standards
where the arguments still goes on is what

1327
01:18:10,941 --> 01:18:13,070
caused that.
What caused the cataclysm.

1328
01:18:13,071 --> 01:18:18,071
I vote strongly for commit multiple
fragments of a comet hitting the North

1329
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:21,230
American ice cap and
hitting Greenland as well.

1330
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:24,620
But there are other researchers in the
field, like my colleague Robert Schoch,

1331
01:18:24,621 --> 01:18:28,280
who thinks that the sudden is more
involved. This is healthy. This is very,

1332
01:18:28,281 --> 01:18:29,690
very healthy that there should,

1333
01:18:29,691 --> 01:18:33,080
we should be approaching this problem
from many different perspectives and

1334
01:18:33,081 --> 01:18:38,081
trying to figure out what the fuck cause
this extraordinary event that occurs at

1335
01:18:38,271 --> 01:18:41,870
a pivotal moment in the human story,
the end of the Stone Age,

1336
01:18:41,871 --> 01:18:44,450
the beginning of the Misa
Lithic the end of the ice age,

1337
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:46,190
the beginning of the
current age of the earth,

1338
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:50,090
and suddenly we see these signs of
civilization appearing and in places like

1339
01:18:50,091 --> 01:18:50,810
Gabelli,
Tepi.

1340
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:55,810
Those signs already include
highly sophisticated knowledge
and that's why I feel

1341
01:18:56,570 --> 01:19:00,200
we really need to investigate the Amazon.
There are,

1342
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:03,500
there are three places in the world
which are really lacking in the

1343
01:19:03,501 --> 01:19:04,760
investigation right now.

1344
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:08,990
One of them is the Amazon five and
a half million square kilometers,

1345
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:13,550
very little archaeology done. Another
is the Sahara desert, the Sahara desert,

1346
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,240
tough place to work. I can understand why
there's little archaeology done there,

1347
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:19,700
but the Sahara desert was
green during the ice age.

1348
01:19:19,701 --> 01:19:21,590
It had a completely
different climate regime.

1349
01:19:21,591 --> 01:19:24,350
We should consider the possibility that
missing parts of the human story are

1350
01:19:24,351 --> 01:19:28,160
there. And then under the continental
shelves, because sea level rose 400 feet,

1351
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:33,340
these are three domains that archeology
has largely not investigated.

1352
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,990
And, and it is largely not
done. So they say, well,

1353
01:19:35,991 --> 01:19:38,420
why would we spend the
money on marine archeology?

1354
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:41,810
It's much better to spend it on looking
for shipwrecks rather than looking for

1355
01:19:41,811 --> 01:19:44,300
signs of a lost civilization
because we archeologist, no,

1356
01:19:44,301 --> 01:19:48,560
there was no lost civilization. So that's
the argument for the resources there.

1357
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:51,820
And, and the same, the same with the
Amazon. And the same with the, with,

1358
01:19:51,821 --> 01:19:56,600
with the Sahara desert places in the very
places in the world that those amongst

1359
01:19:56,601 --> 01:20:00,980
us who are charged with the responsibility
of interpreting the past have not

1360
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:04,580
looked at, are the very prices
we should be looking at.

1361
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:08,220
I have a thought once while
I was under the influence

1362
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:10,650
and it was um,

1363
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:15,740
a thought that one day computational
powers will reach a point where they will

1364
01:20:16,681 --> 01:20:21,681
be able to take into consideration all
of the objects on earth and what we know

1365
01:20:22,441 --> 01:20:26,920
about the history and the vividly
recreate the past through,

1366
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:31,380
through computation to the point where
you could actually know who did what when

1367
01:20:31,381 --> 01:20:34,020
people did things and that at man,

1368
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:38,160
I don't even know if this would be
physical today, certainly not be possible,

1369
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:43,340
but with the exponential increase in
computational power and technology and

1370
01:20:44,761 --> 01:20:48,960
innovation that one day we'll reach a
point where you'll be able to watch,

1371
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:52,740
you'll be able to see what happened
and they'll be able to recreate what

1372
01:20:52,741 --> 01:20:56,520
happened exactly. And that this
would be something that would be,

1373
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:01,830
it's impossible for us to imagine that
someone would be able to do that right

1374
01:21:01,831 --> 01:21:02,664
now.

1375
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:07,700
But that one day with technology as it
gets more and more advanced and we will

1376
01:21:08,191 --> 01:21:09,420
reach some sort of,
uh,

1377
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:14,960
some innovation or some
sort of an invention that
will allow us to go back and

1378
01:21:15,301 --> 01:21:19,470
see, literally see what, what
happened, how things were done.

1379
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:21,690
Tech technologies is changing.

1380
01:21:21,691 --> 01:21:25,830
Our whole understanding of the past
and what you're envisaging is perfectly

1381
01:21:25,831 --> 01:21:29,550
possible. We will, we will
come to a time if 100 years,

1382
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:32,340
500 times less if, if we don't, you know,

1383
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:35,100
first destroy ourselves
entirely as a civilization.

1384
01:21:35,101 --> 01:21:39,600
We will come to a time
where our cleverness and our
techniques will allow a much

1385
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:42,510
wider opening up of the past
then his presently happened,

1386
01:21:42,511 --> 01:21:45,060
but it is already happening.
Um,

1387
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:50,090
one of the areas of science that I go
into in America before his genetics and

1388
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:55,120
DNA, uh, this is an area
of science that, uh,

1389
01:21:55,200 --> 01:22:00,200
was not much informing
archeology until about the 1990s.

1390
01:22:00,421 --> 01:22:04,860
But since the two thousands has become
very important in archeology because the

1391
01:22:04,861 --> 01:22:09,861
technology has been developed
where ancient DNA can be
extracted and tested and

1392
01:22:10,411 --> 01:22:14,670
you can actually genotype
an entire individual from
DNA that may be 15, 20,000,

1393
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:18,240
20,000 years old. Um, and this, uh,

1394
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,760
new technology of genome sequencing and,

1395
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:26,780
and DNA is another factor that is raising
huge question marks over the past of

1396
01:22:27,781 --> 01:22:28,860
the America's.

1397
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:33,861
And one of the issues I go into a in
this book is the presence in the Amazon

1398
01:22:35,641 --> 01:22:38,970
rain forest of a very specific,

1399
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,820
clearly identifiable pattern of DNA,

1400
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:46,620
which is only found in one other place
in the world. And that is in Australasia,

1401
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:50,910
uh, in Papua New Guinea and
amongst Australian aborigines,

1402
01:22:50,911 --> 01:22:54,680
it's Australasian Dna.
Uh, now South America,

1403
01:22:54,930 --> 01:22:56,190
not only in South America,

1404
01:22:56,191 --> 01:23:00,570
but in the depths of the Amazon rain
forest amongst tribes who have only been

1405
01:23:00,571 --> 01:23:04,540
contacted in the last 20 or 30
years. Uh, and further, more,

1406
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,130
although skeletal remains

1407
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:07,300
are rare,

1408
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:12,220
it has been found in ancient skeletal
remains that are close to 11,000 years old

1409
01:23:12,221 --> 01:23:12,701
in the Amazon.

1410
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:17,350
So that tells us that this DNA signal has
been in the Amazon for at least 11,000

1411
01:23:17,351 --> 01:23:22,030
years. The geneticists think that it came
to the Amazon during the last ice age.

1412
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:26,620
And this raises a huge mystery because
the peopling of the Americas is supposed

1413
01:23:26,621 --> 01:23:31,030
to have occurred from Siberia
across the Bering Straits,

1414
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:34,210
down through that ice free
corridor into North America,

1415
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:37,180
down through North America, into
South America, into Central America,

1416
01:23:37,181 --> 01:23:40,960
and finally into South America.
If that was the whole story,

1417
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:46,200
then we would find this DNA signal in
North America and in Central America.

1418
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:49,270
We would not find it only in the Amazon.

1419
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:54,500
When I talked to some of the
leading geneticists about
this, but specifically, um,

1420
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:55,391
Escott professor,

1421
01:23:55,391 --> 01:23:59,530
SK Willis level at the University of
Copenhagen has been the lead author in a

1422
01:23:59,531 --> 01:24:03,160
number of major studies of Ancient Dna.
And I asked him,

1423
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:07,750
what do you make of this Australasian Dna,
uh, in, in the Amazon? And, and he said,

1424
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:12,250
honestly, we don't have a proper
explanation for it at, at the moment.

1425
01:24:12,251 --> 01:24:16,360
But what he did say is that the
most parsimonious explanation,

1426
01:24:16,361 --> 01:24:17,650
he used that specific word,

1427
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:22,680
the most parsimonious explanation is
that a group of people during the ice age

1428
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:28,020
crossed the Pacific Ocean and settled
up and ended up in South America and

1429
01:24:28,091 --> 01:24:30,700
settled in the Amazon and
brought their DNA with them.

1430
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:34,180
That would account
perfectly for the DNA data.

1431
01:24:34,181 --> 01:24:36,970
And when a scientist says the
most parsimonious explanation,

1432
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:40,360
what that scientist is saying is he likes
that explanation that it's a simple,

1433
01:24:40,361 --> 01:24:45,280
direct, clear explanation of the DNA
mystery. But then he added, however,

1434
01:24:45,281 --> 01:24:47,710
it doesn't make practical
sense. And I asked him, well,

1435
01:24:47,711 --> 01:24:49,390
why doesn't it make practical sense?
And he said,

1436
01:24:49,391 --> 01:24:54,391
because the archeologists tell me that
no human population was capable of

1437
01:24:54,941 --> 01:24:57,550
crossing the Pacific
Ocean during the ice age.

1438
01:24:57,610 --> 01:24:59,560
At which point it was
natural for me to say,

1439
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:02,830
do you really trust the
archeologists? And he said, well,

1440
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:06,340
in science we do trust the work of other
scientists. We don't really question it.

1441
01:25:06,341 --> 01:25:08,520
We don't really investigate it.
That's their side of the,

1442
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:11,280
their side of the
business. Um, and, and my,

1443
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:16,310
my view is that that is
rather than rather than excel,

1444
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:21,460
rather than taking this weird anomalous
Austra Lazy and Dna Signal, uh,

1445
01:25:21,490 --> 01:25:24,440
in the, in the, in the
heart of the Amazon, uh,

1446
01:25:24,470 --> 01:25:29,470
as something to be explained a way and
as something to be for it to be denied,

1447
01:25:31,150 --> 01:25:34,330
that it could, it could be connected
to a voyage across the Pacific Ocean.

1448
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:38,500
Maybe it's the first compelling evidence
that voyages were taking place across

1449
01:25:38,501 --> 01:25:40,780
the Pacific Ocean during the ice age.

1450
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:44,830
And maybe we should be opening up that
whole issue for exploration. And again,

1451
01:25:44,831 --> 01:25:47,920
I think I lost a lost
civilization is the best answer.

1452
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:50,770
And that near the end of the ice age when,

1453
01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:55,420
when the younger dryas cataclysm unfolds,
it's not an overnight thing.

1454
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:59,380
It's very bad. 12,000, 800
years ago, there's about 1000,

1455
01:25:59,381 --> 01:26:00,580
200 years of horror.

1456
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:03,920
I don't think the civilization went
down in a single day and night.

1457
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:07,280
I think there were survivors,
I think bits of it were left.

1458
01:26:07,281 --> 01:26:10,340
I think their project was
to restart civilization.

1459
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:15,110
And I suggest very strongly that where
they tried to mount that project was

1460
01:26:15,111 --> 01:26:20,111
amongst the hunter gatherers who coexisted
in the world with them at that time.

1461
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:23,600
We ourselves are an advanced civilization,

1462
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:25,580
at least that's what we call ourselves.

1463
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:29,180
And we coexist in the world
with hunter gatherers. Uh,

1464
01:26:29,181 --> 01:26:31,580
it's not an odd idea that
an advanced civilization,

1465
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:35,120
a hunter gather as should coexist and
there is separation between us and the

1466
01:26:35,121 --> 01:26:36,260
Amazonian hunter gathers.

1467
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:39,740
There are tribes in the Amazon
that are uncontacted and that we,

1468
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:44,770
that we don't know even
exist if catastrophe on the
level of the younger dryas

1469
01:26:47,390 --> 01:26:49,160
were to occur today.

1470
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:52,760
I don't think that our
civilization would make it through.

1471
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,880
We are the spoiled children of the earth.

1472
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:59,720
We are just used to having
everything laid on. You know,

1473
01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:04,010
the supermarket shelves are groaning with,
with food.

1474
01:27:04,011 --> 01:27:07,460
We can get food delivered to our homes.
We have roofs over our head.

1475
01:27:07,461 --> 01:27:10,340
We have shelters, we have coding.
Everything is taken for granted.

1476
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:12,110
I guess you an exception.

1477
01:27:12,111 --> 01:27:16,280
But very few people in modern
western culture know how to survive.

1478
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:18,590
They don't have survival skills.
They don't know how to hunt.

1479
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:19,970
They don't know how to gather.

1480
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:23,900
They don't know how to grow crops because
they've handed that responsibility

1481
01:27:23,901 --> 01:27:24,591
over to others.

1482
01:27:24,591 --> 01:27:27,980
We live in a society
that's highly segmented and
specialized in different people

1483
01:27:27,981 --> 01:27:29,210
specialize in different things,

1484
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:34,130
but nobody has the vast general survival
skill that a hunter gatherer has.

1485
01:27:34,131 --> 01:27:38,180
So in a global cataclysm,
actually at first counterintuitively,

1486
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:41,930
the people who would survive it would
be the hunter gatherers and an advanced

1487
01:27:41,931 --> 01:27:46,730
civilization would be smart if they were
survivors to seek refuge amongst hunter

1488
01:27:46,731 --> 01:27:50,420
gatherers, uh, to, to make that the
place where they might try to start,

1489
01:27:50,421 --> 01:27:51,710
restart their civilization.

1490
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:56,710
And that's why I think that this Austria
Lazy and DNA signal in the Amazon may

1491
01:27:57,261 --> 01:28:01,180
be part of the evidence for a sort of
outreach effort that was being made by a

1492
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:02,090
lost civilization.

1493
01:28:02,091 --> 01:28:05,630
Seeing the disaster coming down on it
and realizing that something needed to be

1494
01:28:05,631 --> 01:28:06,590
done well,

1495
01:28:06,591 --> 01:28:10,580
it's fascinating to me
that the geneticists would
rely on the archeologists

1496
01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:13,340
being that the geneticists
have the actual DNA,

1497
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:16,520
they can examine where the archeologists
are piecing things together.

1498
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:21,740
Absolutely tiny bits of information
over the entire landscape.

1499
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:25,520
And then you consider how much information
they don't have access to that's in

1500
01:28:25,521 --> 01:28:27,580
the ground. Exactly. I,

1501
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:30,830
I strongly resist the idea
that archeology is a science.

1502
01:28:30,890 --> 01:28:33,380
I don't think it should
be described as a science.

1503
01:28:33,381 --> 01:28:36,290
What do you think it should be described?
It's more like a kind of philosophy.

1504
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:41,120
It's a, it's, it's a, it's an
attempt to interpret the past, uh,

1505
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:44,600
based on rather flimsy
and limited evidence.

1506
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:47,750
And what you find in that interpretation
is that the preconceptions of the

1507
01:28:47,751 --> 01:28:50,690
individuals involved are being
imposed upon the evidence,

1508
01:28:50,691 --> 01:28:53,870
which then turns out to
support their preconceptions.

1509
01:28:53,871 --> 01:28:55,850
And that's not a scientific
way of doing things.

1510
01:28:55,851 --> 01:28:57,500
A scientific way of
doing things is testing,

1511
01:28:57,770 --> 01:29:01,860
testing hypotheses and false seeking
to falsify them and seeing if, if they,

1512
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:02,760
if they work out.

1513
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:06,330
So the problem is drawing
these conclusions and then
being too rigid with these

1514
01:29:06,331 --> 01:29:10,800
conclusions on the further evidence.
That's, that's my view that, that,

1515
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:15,450
that archeology has been,
has been much too rigid and,
and the, and that there's a,

1516
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:18,690
there's a climate of fear in archeology.

1517
01:29:18,691 --> 01:29:21,150
I don't mean to pick particularly
on archeologists here,

1518
01:29:21,210 --> 01:29:25,830
I think this is generally true
across other disciplines as well.

1519
01:29:26,290 --> 01:29:30,960
Um, these days academics are driven by
the need to publish research papers.

1520
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:32,700
That's what they build their careers on.

1521
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:36,480
If they can get a paper on their bit
of research published in nature of the

1522
01:29:36,481 --> 01:29:38,760
proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, et Cetera,

1523
01:29:38,970 --> 01:29:40,980
that's good for their careers.

1524
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:46,250
But then you confront the gatekeepers
in those publications who regard any

1525
01:29:46,291 --> 01:29:50,370
archeological idea that is not part of
the mainstream accepted consensus with

1526
01:29:50,371 --> 01:29:55,200
great suspicion and are most
most reluctant, uh, to, to,

1527
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:58,620
you know, to publish, to
publish that information. Now,

1528
01:29:58,621 --> 01:30:01,240
what is the mainstream, what, when,

1529
01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:05,490
when archeologists talk about
seafaring humans, when, what,

1530
01:30:05,491 --> 01:30:08,200
what did they date that too?
Well, there's the great,

1531
01:30:08,810 --> 01:30:12,900
the great seafaring adventure that is
accepted by archeology is called the

1532
01:30:12,901 --> 01:30:15,720
Polynesian expansion.
And it's a remarkable story.

1533
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:20,100
And that occurs roughly
3000 to 3,500 years ago.

1534
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:24,330
And those Polynesians were amazing
ocean navigators. They could,

1535
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:29,010
they could cross distances of thousands
of kilometers with pinpoint accuracy.

1536
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:29,550
I mean,

1537
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:34,140
it's not an accident that the Polynesians
found Easter island fighting Easter

1538
01:30:34,141 --> 01:30:36,270
island is a really challenging project.

1539
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,690
Easter island is 2000 miles
from the coast of South America.

1540
01:30:39,870 --> 01:30:43,320
It's 2000 miles from the nearest
other island, which is Tahiti.

1541
01:30:43,470 --> 01:30:46,110
It's just a little speck
in the middle of the ocean.

1542
01:30:46,111 --> 01:30:50,100
But the Polynesians found it and settled
there and appear to have brought a

1543
01:30:50,101 --> 01:30:54,450
reproductively viable population there
and appear to have made voyages back and

1544
01:30:54,451 --> 01:30:58,170
forth.
But that was 3000 to 3,500 years ago.

1545
01:30:58,171 --> 01:31:02,010
That was not 12,800 years
ago. Uh, and this is,

1546
01:31:02,011 --> 01:31:07,011
this is where archeology is adamant
position that ocean voyaging was begun by

1547
01:31:08,311 --> 01:31:11,430
the Polynesians and that there
was no major ocean voyages before.

1548
01:31:11,431 --> 01:31:14,370
That I think needs to be strongly
questioned and it needs to be strongly

1549
01:31:14,371 --> 01:31:17,850
questioned in the light of this DNA
evidence from the Amazon rather than

1550
01:31:17,851 --> 01:31:21,330
rejecting the evidence and attempt should
be made to consider what that might

1551
01:31:21,331 --> 01:31:25,710
mean. Well, it's interesting because we
know that the Egyptians had boats. Yeah.

1552
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:29,700
And so what I mean,
if there were boats 4,500 years ago,

1553
01:31:29,701 --> 01:31:31,740
why do we think that they didn't
try them out in the ocean?

1554
01:31:31,741 --> 01:31:34,860
That doesn't make any sense. Especially
if there existed a thousand years prior,

1555
01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:39,570
which is also possible.
Archeologist wouldn't argue
that the Egyptians had boats,

1556
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:43,960
but, but that is, that is still within
the framework of accepted history. It's,

1557
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:45,140
it's the notion of a,

1558
01:31:45,141 --> 01:31:50,141
of a global navigating culture in the
ice age that archeologists can't swallow.

1559
01:31:51,421 --> 01:31:55,500
It's a subject that I've kept on coming
up against over a number of years.

1560
01:31:55,501 --> 01:31:59,290
I think the best evidence
for it is ancient maps, uh,

1561
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:02,740
which show the world as it
looked during the last ice age.

1562
01:32:02,741 --> 01:32:05,590
I've first explored this in fingerprints
of the gods and I've touched on the

1563
01:32:05,591 --> 01:32:08,590
mystery again and I haven't had
an appendix on the subject in, in,

1564
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:10,780
in this book because I think
these are very important.

1565
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:16,110
We're talking about maps that were drawn
roughly between the 13 hundreds and the

1566
01:32:16,241 --> 01:32:20,410
17 hundreds. Uh, in other words,
in relatively recent history,

1567
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:21,513
however,

1568
01:32:21,550 --> 01:32:25,870
these maps were largely based
on much older source maps,

1569
01:32:25,930 --> 01:32:27,220
which they copied.

1570
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:30,800
And we can say that for sure because
one of the famous maps is the period

1571
01:32:30,801 --> 01:32:34,510
[inaudible] map which was created by a
Turkish admiral called Perry Reece in the

1572
01:32:34,511 --> 01:32:38,740
year 1513. Uh, actually only a
corner of his map has survived.

1573
01:32:38,741 --> 01:32:40,240
It was originally a world map.

1574
01:32:40,241 --> 01:32:44,170
We now just have a bit that shows the
east coast of South America and North

1575
01:32:44,171 --> 01:32:46,330
America and the west coast of Africa.

1576
01:32:46,690 --> 01:32:51,520
Peary Reece writes in that map that it
is in his own handwriting that he based

1577
01:32:51,521 --> 01:32:54,280
it on more than 100 older source maps,

1578
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:59,320
some of which had come from the
library of Alexandria. In other words,

1579
01:32:59,321 --> 01:33:02,800
that maps had been when the library of
Alexandria had been destroyed in the

1580
01:33:02,801 --> 01:33:04,510
fourth century idea whenever it was,

1581
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:08,320
some of its contents had been rescued
and brought to Constantinople,

1582
01:33:08,321 --> 01:33:12,010
which became the Turkish capitol and Peary
Reese had access to those maps and he

1583
01:33:12,011 --> 01:33:16,990
incorporated information from those maps
on his maps as well as incorporating

1584
01:33:16,991 --> 01:33:19,300
more recent navigational information.

1585
01:33:19,450 --> 01:33:23,710
And this is one of a whole category of
maps which are extremely hard to explain.

1586
01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:27,790
All of them based on older source maps.
Now lost all of them.

1587
01:33:27,791 --> 01:33:32,200
Incorporating extremely precise
relative longitudes and latitudes.

1588
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:35,530
Latitude is not that difficult
to technological feat,

1589
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:38,260
but longitude is a difficult
technological feat.

1590
01:33:38,261 --> 01:33:40,750
Longitude involves a chronometer.

1591
01:33:40,751 --> 01:33:43,000
It involves knowing the
time at the place you began,

1592
01:33:43,001 --> 01:33:45,490
your voyage and the local
and local noon as well.

1593
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,170
And calculating the
difference between them.

1594
01:33:47,171 --> 01:33:52,150
You need a chronometer that we'll keep
accurate time at sea with the Mo motions

1595
01:33:52,151 --> 01:33:56,440
of a ship. And it's just a plain fact that
our civilization did not invent such a

1596
01:33:56,441 --> 01:33:59,230
chronometer until the late 18th century.

1597
01:33:59,470 --> 01:34:02,680
Before that we didn't know what
longitude where we were at.

1598
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:06,460
And ships were constantly
sailing unexpectedly into
coastlines that they thought

1599
01:34:06,461 --> 01:34:08,560
were hundreds of miles further away.

1600
01:34:08,561 --> 01:34:12,730
So the discovery of the technique to do
longer chewed was a major civilizational

1601
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:13,564
advance.

1602
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:18,130
Its presence in maps based on much
older source maps that actually show the

1603
01:34:18,131 --> 01:34:22,840
world as it looks during the last ice age
suggests that somebody during the last

1604
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:27,250
ice age was mapping the world and had
mastered the technique of calculating a

1605
01:34:27,251 --> 01:34:31,830
longer shoot. Classic
example of these maps. Um,

1606
01:34:32,110 --> 01:34:36,460
and I make a point of this is what's
called the Pinkerton world map,

1607
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,160
which was drawn in the year 18,

1608
01:34:39,161 --> 01:34:44,161
18 and it was based on the latest
navigational information at that time.

1609
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,840
I reproduce that map in
the, in, in the book.

1610
01:34:47,230 --> 01:34:50,830
What's missing from the map
entirely missing is Antarctica.

1611
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:54,880
There's just a hole at the bottom
of the world. There's nothing there.

1612
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:58,610
And the reason, there's a reason,
there's nothing, there's another,

1613
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:03,140
there's another Pinkerton map that uh,
that shows that the,

1614
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:08,570
the reason that you need to find one
that's centered on Antarctica, the reason,

1615
01:35:08,571 --> 01:35:12,500
the reason that Antarctica is not
there is that our civilization hadn't

1616
01:35:12,501 --> 01:35:17,501
discovered Antarctica in 1818 so they
couldn't authentically put it on a map in

1617
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:20,420
1818.
Actually we discovered it in 18,

1618
01:35:20,421 --> 01:35:24,230
19 and that's when it starts
appearing on modern maps.

1619
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:29,540
The problem is that Antarctica repeat
appears repeatedly on these much older

1620
01:35:29,541 --> 01:35:34,490
maps and it appears in the right place,
uh, and a bit bigger than it is today,

1621
01:35:34,491 --> 01:35:36,980
but very much as it looked
during the last ice age.

1622
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:41,840
So what all of this suggests to me is
that the world was mapped and explored by

1623
01:35:41,841 --> 01:35:45,350
a global seafaring culture with the
level of technology that was at least

1624
01:35:45,351 --> 01:35:49,100
equivalent to ours at the end of the
18th century. Uh, during the ice age.

1625
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:53,510
Wasn't there also a map of Greenland
that showed it underneath the ice? Yes,

1626
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:57,830
there are. And, and, and, and, uh,
another intriguing thing I met,

1627
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:02,860
I mentioned the Peary Reece map just now
shown on the Perry Reece map lying off

1628
01:36:02,961 --> 01:36:07,820
the east coast of North America is a
large island with a row of megaliths,

1629
01:36:07,821 --> 01:36:12,030
like a road of megaliths
running up the middle of it. Um,

1630
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:17,000
that island is in the exact place
of the Grand Bahama banks. Uh, and,

1631
01:36:17,001 --> 01:36:21,340
and uh, just one. Yeah, it is. Um,

1632
01:36:21,410 --> 01:36:23,840
but can I point it out
to you because I'm sure

1633
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:31,280
that's right. Okay. That one. Okay, that's
great that you can bring this up Jeremy.

1634
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:36,110
So this island is sitting there off
the southeast coast of North America.

1635
01:36:36,390 --> 01:36:38,600
I think we have these to
dry things back then too.

1636
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:43,850
And what you see running down the middle
of it is this road like feature of our

1637
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:46,900
main list.
I see right there.

1638
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:51,080
Now the thing is,
it was a long period of my life when I,

1639
01:36:51,190 --> 01:36:54,710
I did a lot of scuba diving and I was
looking at an underwater structures and

1640
01:36:54,711 --> 01:36:57,500
one of the sites I dived
on was the Bimini road,

1641
01:36:57,620 --> 01:36:59,180
which is in the Grand Bahama banks.

1642
01:36:59,630 --> 01:37:03,350
And the remedy road is exactly
where the island is and the that.

1643
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:08,090
Here's the issue. I don't care whether
the Bimini road is natural or manmade.

1644
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:11,990
For me, the mystery is that it
is shown above water on that map.

1645
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:16,070
And the last time it was above water was
thousands and thousands of years ago.

1646
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:16,791
So for me,

1647
01:37:16,791 --> 01:37:20,480
this is all evidence that we shouldn't
dismiss the possibility that our

1648
01:37:20,481 --> 01:37:24,140
ancestors had achieved a
level of technology where
they could explore in that

1649
01:37:24,141 --> 01:37:25,970
the world's oceans.
We shouldn't dismiss that.

1650
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:30,950
We don't know what those stones are,
how they were created, but bully.

1651
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:34,640
Do they look artifacts you on a
Goonie and Japan we're looking at now,

1652
01:37:34,641 --> 01:37:37,980
but the back to that image to me did the
last image that we were just looking at

1653
01:37:37,981 --> 01:37:42,350
it. Look at that. That looks so man man.
And you can see that as rather like the,

1654
01:37:42,351 --> 01:37:45,470
the, the pattern that's showing on
the, on the island in the, in the map.

1655
01:37:45,490 --> 01:37:48,550
How deep is that today? Oh, it's not
very deep. It's about 20 feet. There's,

1656
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:51,330
but we think that that was
above water at some point.

1657
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:54,740
This trip was definitely above water
during the last ice age when it,

1658
01:37:54,770 --> 01:37:56,390
when finally went underwater.

1659
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,280
May have been as late as
eight or 9,000 years ago.

1660
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:01,470
Is there anything else compelling that's
in the immediate area that seems to

1661
01:38:01,471 --> 01:38:03,870
indicate that there was some sort
of a manmade structure? Well,

1662
01:38:03,871 --> 01:38:05,270
nobody's looked for it.
Uh,

1663
01:38:05,271 --> 01:38:08,940
and the whole effort of archeology has
been to dismiss the significance of the

1664
01:38:08,941 --> 01:38:11,540
BIM and a row. How would they dismiss
that? Well, they say it's just,

1665
01:38:11,541 --> 01:38:15,400
to me they say it's totally natural.
Comma is go,

1666
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:18,840
go back to that image again. This,
but, but well this is the og.

1667
01:38:18,841 --> 01:38:22,170
You go back to that image
that we just saw. Yeah, sure.

1668
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:24,870
Somebody who spent a lot of
time diving on the Bimini road.

1669
01:38:24,871 --> 01:38:27,660
I can tell you I absolutely
do not think it's natural.

1670
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:28,980
I think it's a manmade structure,

1671
01:38:28,981 --> 01:38:32,610
but the argument is that it's a kind of
beach rock that forms in these blocky

1672
01:38:32,611 --> 01:38:35,820
for me is that a speech rock
does form in Bocky permission.

1673
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:39,360
But here I believe that the beach rock
has been used as a construction material.

1674
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,130
But I repeat,

1675
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:45,930
the key issue is not whether the
Bimini road is manmade or not.

1676
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:49,470
The key issue is that it
features on the map above water.

1677
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:53,910
And that is a dating project that tells
us that somebody was mapping that bit of

1678
01:38:53,911 --> 01:38:58,260
the world when it was above water.
And that takes us back a very long,

1679
01:38:58,410 --> 01:39:00,990
a long way into the past. The one
that you just pulled up, you know,

1680
01:39:00,991 --> 01:39:04,310
look at that one. That's a stunning
place. It's this amazing site.

1681
01:39:04,490 --> 01:39:09,210
It's just like the odds of that being
in that order with those uniformly sized

1682
01:39:09,211 --> 01:39:13,400
rocks for how long has that Oh,
hundreds of feet. It's, it's a huge,

1683
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:17,370
it's actually shaped like the letter j.
It's a giant underwater structure.

1684
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:19,140
It's really,
really an enormous thing and very,

1685
01:39:19,170 --> 01:39:22,530
very beautiful dive on and there's lots
of very gentle sweet nurse sharks down

1686
01:39:22,531 --> 01:39:25,950
there that you can play with it.
So that looks much more like random.

1687
01:39:26,010 --> 01:39:27,240
That's more random and bits of it,

1688
01:39:27,241 --> 01:39:31,750
bits of it do look more random bits of
it look highly constructed. I would not,

1689
01:39:32,430 --> 01:39:37,430
I would not seek to to claim that the
Bimini road is absolutely manmade.

1690
01:39:37,530 --> 01:39:39,030
My claim about the Bimini road is,

1691
01:39:39,031 --> 01:39:42,060
it's really fucking weird that
it appears on a map above water,

1692
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:46,030
a map that was drawn in 1513
based on older source map.

1693
01:39:46,290 --> 01:39:49,670
Now when they found that ancient Greek uh,

1694
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:54,180
computer thing and what, what does that
call Denton Kai Theora mechanism? Yes.

1695
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:54,871
Again,

1696
01:39:54,871 --> 01:39:59,871
that testifies to a lost navigational
skill that we have not taken account of

1697
01:40:00,690 --> 01:40:05,070
incredibly complex and it took a long
time for them to figure out what that even

1698
01:40:05,071 --> 01:40:09,900
is. What do they think that
is now? Um, it, it tracks
the movements of the planets.

1699
01:40:09,901 --> 01:40:12,830
It's a, it's a navigational
device. It's a, it, it, it,

1700
01:40:12,831 --> 01:40:17,610
it's a geared cogged system that allows
you to track the passage of time and

1701
01:40:17,611 --> 01:40:18,840
figure out where you are.
It's,

1702
01:40:18,860 --> 01:40:22,380
it's some kind of navigational devices
not fully understood. And how old is that?

1703
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:24,720
I think that goes back to Greek times.

1704
01:40:24,721 --> 01:40:28,560
I'm guessing here because the Greek
times are not of great interest to me,

1705
01:40:28,561 --> 01:40:30,900
but I'm thinking around about 500 BC.

1706
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:34,710
So at least 2000 years old.
2000 plus.

1707
01:40:34,770 --> 01:40:39,510
And we know that there had to be
more than one of these things. Yes.

1708
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:42,450
It, you can't, you can't have
something like that without,

1709
01:40:42,690 --> 01:40:46,050
without a vast effort behind it.
Human beings,

1710
01:40:46,051 --> 01:40:50,180
we're working on creating this geared
and cogged machinery, uh, that,

1711
01:40:50,190 --> 01:40:54,810
that reflected the patterns that are
recreated. That's a recreation. Wow.

1712
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:57,100
Do you keep I one of those,

1713
01:40:58,310 --> 01:41:02,050
it looks like you buy that dude fine.
Bookmark that.

1714
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:04,990
We need one right there,
right next to the plastic cells.

1715
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:08,860
And so such a thing is a is a cultural
artifact which doesn't just appear out of

1716
01:41:08,861 --> 01:41:12,460
nowhere. It hasn't, it has to have a
context. It has to have a background.

1717
01:41:12,461 --> 01:41:15,070
And again,
my suggestion would be

1718
01:41:16,630 --> 01:41:18,250
perhaps a secret technology.

1719
01:41:18,251 --> 01:41:22,670
It's very odd that very few of these
have been found and it may be that ship

1720
01:41:22,671 --> 01:41:24,820
owners and navigators in Greek times,

1721
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:29,230
we're extremely careful about who they
shared this technology where of course it

1722
01:41:29,231 --> 01:41:34,030
made, they may, it may have been as top
secret as you know, nuclear power is in,

1723
01:41:34,031 --> 01:41:39,010
in, in our world today. Oh,
that makes sense. But the
fact is that then we have to,

1724
01:41:39,070 --> 01:41:41,230
we, it exists. It's real,

1725
01:41:41,290 --> 01:41:45,710
it's there and then we must
consider what's behind it. What,

1726
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:46,810
what led to that?

1727
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:50,770
Is that just the latest manifestation
of something that that goes much more

1728
01:41:50,771 --> 01:41:54,580
deeply back into human, human
culture? And I think that is, I think,

1729
01:41:54,820 --> 01:41:58,420
I suppose my main, my main
messages that we have, uh,

1730
01:41:58,421 --> 01:42:03,421
so far untold backstory that
we're concentrating entirely
on the front story and

1731
01:42:03,491 --> 01:42:06,820
the backstory is missing,
very largely missing from the picture.

1732
01:42:06,821 --> 01:42:09,430
And what I've tried to do is to
fill in bits of the backstory.

1733
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:14,170
Do you have anything in this book
about the Omex? No, not really. Um, I,

1734
01:42:14,180 --> 01:42:19,000
I mentioned, I mentioned them briefly.
Uh, I explored the old Mac mystery,

1735
01:42:19,150 --> 01:42:23,680
uh, in considerable depth can explain that
to people maybe in the fingerprints of

1736
01:42:23,681 --> 01:42:25,030
the gods.
A yes.

1737
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:29,680
So it's considered to be the earliest
high culture of Central America.

1738
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:33,880
Everybody's heard about the Aztecs,
everybody's heard about the Maya.

1739
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:37,270
But before the Aztecs and before the Maya,

1740
01:42:37,690 --> 01:42:42,130
there were a culture who are
referred to as the old Max.

1741
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:45,040
Again,
we don't know what they called themselves.

1742
01:42:45,070 --> 01:42:47,380
That's what the Aztecs called them.
They called them the old Mexican.

1743
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:51,720
It means the rubber people because they
see a rubber producing area of, uh,

1744
01:42:51,730 --> 01:42:52,563
of Mexico.

1745
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:57,960
They worked in a giant
megalithic constructions
that what they're most famous

1746
01:42:58,691 --> 01:43:02,080
for is these huge carved human heads,

1747
01:43:02,350 --> 01:43:07,060
which can be on a scale of up
to 20 to 25 tons in weight,

1748
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:11,980
uh, and, and which have curious features
which have been interpreted variously as

1749
01:43:11,981 --> 01:43:16,981
Polynesian African don't look like
classic native American features.

1750
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:19,330
But one of the things,

1751
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:23,560
one of the things I've realized is that
there is no classic native American

1752
01:43:23,561 --> 01:43:27,130
feature that that native
Americans are a very,

1753
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:32,160
have a very complex genetic story with
very many different elements brought into

1754
01:43:32,351 --> 01:43:36,040
it and we shouldn't be necessarily
surprised by the supposedly non native

1755
01:43:36,041 --> 01:43:38,710
American look. These are my kids. They do.

1756
01:43:38,710 --> 01:43:43,540
We think those helmets where they're
wearing nobody knows because no physical

1757
01:43:43,541 --> 01:43:45,610
example of such a helmet
has ever been found.

1758
01:43:45,611 --> 01:43:49,660
Just like no physical example of an
Egyptian Pharaohs hell a crown has it has

1759
01:43:49,661 --> 01:43:53,900
ever been found. All we see is the stone.
The stone reproductions of them do.

1760
01:43:53,901 --> 01:43:56,150
They're universally wear these
helmets and they say all day.

1761
01:43:56,270 --> 01:44:00,950
They pretty much all wear these helmets
in, in, in, in the ALMAC stonework.

1762
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:05,980
There's another fascinating figure from
La Venta when one of the Omex sites,

1763
01:44:07,311 --> 01:44:12,311
which is the earliest ever image
of a plumed or feathered serpent.

1764
01:44:12,950 --> 01:44:17,380
The feathered serpent is a famous icon
in Central America, quite sal collateral,

1765
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:19,280
who's the god of peace,

1766
01:44:19,281 --> 01:44:23,840
the bringer of civilization
who is associated, for example,

1767
01:44:23,841 --> 01:44:26,780
with the famous pyramid of,
of Cookwell con,

1768
01:44:26,781 --> 01:44:29,480
which is just another name for quite
awhile, Catholic church, Anita,

1769
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:31,220
where on the spring equinox,

1770
01:44:31,230 --> 01:44:36,230
a shadow effect creates the image of a
serpent coiling down the stairway and

1771
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:38,820
joining with the carved head
of the serpent or the bears,

1772
01:44:38,821 --> 01:44:40,160
the image from La Venta.

1773
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:44,300
That's the earliest image of a
plumed serpent in the Americas.

1774
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:46,220
And sitting in the middle of it,

1775
01:44:46,221 --> 01:44:49,340
and I made a big deal out of this cause
I think it is a big deal in magicians of

1776
01:44:49,341 --> 01:44:53,120
the gods sitting in the middle of it
is this human figure who's holding this

1777
01:44:53,210 --> 01:44:55,490
strange bag in his hand.

1778
01:44:55,730 --> 01:45:00,730
And it's just a fact that those identical
bags are found in ancient sooner in

1779
01:45:01,611 --> 01:45:05,330
the hands of individuals who were
considered to be civilization bringers.

1780
01:45:05,510 --> 01:45:09,380
And they also show up on pillar
43 at Gabelli Beckley Tepi,

1781
01:45:10,010 --> 01:45:13,050
I call the man bags. Uh, and in
that case it got back to the Tempe.

1782
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:15,350
We know they're at least 11,600 years old.

1783
01:45:15,351 --> 01:45:18,170
So I wonder if we are looking at a
sort of badge of office of a group of

1784
01:45:18,171 --> 01:45:22,070
civilizes who traveled around the world
trying to bring back to life a lost

1785
01:45:22,071 --> 01:45:23,630
civilization and pass down.

1786
01:45:24,410 --> 01:45:28,790
I deploy a concept in this book that
I actually got from Richard Dawkins.

1787
01:45:28,850 --> 01:45:32,030
Richard Richard Dawkins is the author
of the book called the selfish gene.

1788
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:34,730
And he's not one of my
favorite people because he's a,

1789
01:45:34,731 --> 01:45:38,900
he's a materialist reductionist and
he doesn't believe in spirit or,

1790
01:45:38,901 --> 01:45:42,500
or any mystery in life that were just
accidents of chemistry and biology.

1791
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:45,110
We also has no psychedelic experience.
And he said no,

1792
01:45:45,111 --> 01:45:47,000
I did challenge him at a public event to,

1793
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:51,260
to go to go have a dozen sessions of
Iowasca and its still gas at once or just

1794
01:45:51,261 --> 01:45:54,450
once would be enough. But he has
an excellent out because, uh,

1795
01:45:54,530 --> 01:45:55,500
and sadly he's had a,

1796
01:45:55,501 --> 01:45:58,850
he's had a stroke so he has a good
excuse for not for not doing that,

1797
01:45:58,851 --> 01:46:00,590
but he's a clever man.

1798
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:04,190
And one of his concepts
that he's introduced into
human culture is the concept

1799
01:46:04,191 --> 01:46:07,520
of the meme. We're off, I
think familiar with that word.

1800
01:46:07,521 --> 01:46:11,090
Genes are a physical
reproductive mechanisms.

1801
01:46:11,091 --> 01:46:14,510
They reproduce themselves down
the generations they replicate,

1802
01:46:14,511 --> 01:46:17,060
they multiply their passed on
from one individual to another.

1803
01:46:17,061 --> 01:46:18,680
Memes are cultural objects,

1804
01:46:18,681 --> 01:46:23,270
cultural ideas that are passed on and
replicate and reproduce themselves and

1805
01:46:23,271 --> 01:46:28,271
what I see right across the Americas and
right across the old world as well is a

1806
01:46:28,581 --> 01:46:33,080
set of memes that involve the sky,
that involve the ground,

1807
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:36,980
that involved geometry,
that involve notions of life after death,

1808
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:42,170
and I think the only way to explain these
is that they have been inherited from

1809
01:46:42,171 --> 01:46:46,760
an earlier culture that was in some way
connected with the ancestors of all of

1810
01:46:46,761 --> 01:46:49,770
these, all of these cultures. I think
that's what we are looking in the Amazon.

1811
01:46:49,771 --> 01:46:52,830
We're looking at a meme which
was deliberately created.

1812
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:57,870
Once you mobilize the population to start
creating huge geometrical structures,

1813
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:02,640
you are also facilitating many other
possibilities that an organized population

1814
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:05,610
allows. I think that's what
happened at got Beckley Tepi.

1815
01:47:05,611 --> 01:47:09,900
I think that's why they
created the Megalithic site
there to mobilize the local

1816
01:47:09,901 --> 01:47:13,170
population of hunter gatherers,
to give them a project to do,

1817
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:17,820
to engage them and in the process of
engaging them to teach them the skills of

1818
01:47:17,821 --> 01:47:22,140
agriculture which were, which, which
are fundamental to any concept of,

1819
01:47:22,190 --> 01:47:22,981
of civilization.

1820
01:47:22,981 --> 01:47:27,200
And it's weird the way agriculture
just suddenly appears in in Quebec,

1821
01:47:27,220 --> 01:47:32,220
the tappy and there's huge agricultural
mysteries in the Amazon as well.

1822
01:47:32,980 --> 01:47:36,840
Um, may I share a couple
of leaves messages with you
before you do that though?

1823
01:47:36,841 --> 01:47:38,980
Can you pull up that image from Gabelli?

1824
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,080
Tapi of pillar was the pillar
4,343 in enclosure day.

1825
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:46,770
I would like to see that that
guy holding that bag. That is,

1826
01:47:48,430 --> 01:47:51,820
the bags are in a row along
the top of the pillow. Um,

1827
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:57,740
it's pillar 43 in, in an enclosure d
at go back to the Tempe. Is there a,

1828
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:01,230
an image of that online? It's
available. Okay, here we go. Yeah,

1829
01:48:01,231 --> 01:48:06,231
there's the bags in a row and a row
along the top as the same sort of square

1830
01:48:06,631 --> 01:48:10,140
shaped bag with a curved handle that
you find on the earliest image of the

1831
01:48:10,141 --> 01:48:13,590
pillar of the feathered serpent. And that
you find, no, you have to go above that,

1832
01:48:13,591 --> 01:48:18,470
Jamie. Um, just a little bit higher
up the pillar. That was Max, right,

1833
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:22,620
right, right at the top there. It's
odd that this symbol crops up in,

1834
01:48:22,650 --> 01:48:25,930
in many different cultures and tends
to be associated with some kind of

1835
01:48:26,370 --> 01:48:29,610
interpretation of those. There's no
mainstream interpretation of those bags.

1836
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:34,290
That's my interpretation of those bags,
uh, which I, which I freely confess.

1837
01:48:34,291 --> 01:48:35,490
That's how,
that's how I read them.

1838
01:48:35,491 --> 01:48:39,210
I'm intrigued by the anomaly that the
similar bag and turns up in the hands of

1839
01:48:39,211 --> 01:48:44,130
the quite so collateral figure and turns
up in Mesopotamia repeatedly, um, in,

1840
01:48:44,230 --> 01:48:47,330
in the hands of the individuals who
are called the App Kalu the, the,

1841
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:50,220
the magicians of the gods,
the beginning bringers of civilization,

1842
01:48:50,221 --> 01:48:53,790
the plume serpent [inaudible] Quadel
was, it's an Aztec card, right.

1843
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:57,510
And quest quest of collateral is
an Aztec is an Aztec God. But,

1844
01:48:57,570 --> 01:49:00,210
but the Aztecs acquired
him from earlier cultures.

1845
01:49:00,211 --> 01:49:04,410
The very fact that an image of the plumed
serpent is given such priority in all

1846
01:49:04,411 --> 01:49:08,640
met culture tells us that that system of
ideas was present during all Mac Times,

1847
01:49:08,820 --> 01:49:13,820
which takes us back at least to 1500 BC
probably quite a bit earlier than that.

1848
01:49:14,311 --> 01:49:16,960
Where's the Aztecs are 1,580.

1849
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:20,030
So there's 3000 years between
the Aztecs and the Olmecs.

1850
01:49:20,070 --> 01:49:23,880
And that same system of ideas is
running through all of those cultures.

1851
01:49:23,910 --> 01:49:26,220
And the Mayans had a name
for it as well. Cool. Cool.

1852
01:49:26,221 --> 01:49:29,670
Con and what do you think
that plumed serpent was?

1853
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:32,690
I think he's the,
it's very clear from,

1854
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:36,180
from the accounts that have survived that
what he's associated with a two things

1855
01:49:36,181 --> 01:49:39,840
in PR in particular. One of
them, he's a god of peace.

1856
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:42,780
He's not a a war God. Uh, and the,

1857
01:49:42,781 --> 01:49:47,740
and the other thing that he's
primarily about is giving the gifts of

1858
01:49:47,741 --> 01:49:49,900
civilization.
This is what you,

1859
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:54,460
human beings need to know in order
to move on to the next level.

1860
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:58,720
Uh, that is, that is the function
and the role of quite our collateral.

1861
01:49:58,750 --> 01:50:00,940
And it's there are very similar,

1862
01:50:01,270 --> 01:50:05,860
we could refer to them as civilizing
heroes who are found in other cultures and

1863
01:50:05,861 --> 01:50:09,580
other locations, or Cyrus in
Egypt plays that role, uh,

1864
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:11,500
as a bringer of civilization.

1865
01:50:11,501 --> 01:50:15,940
There's hardly a culture in the ancient
world that doesn't remember a time far

1866
01:50:15,941 --> 01:50:20,941
back in remote prehistory when some
kind of supernatural or advanced human

1867
01:50:22,661 --> 01:50:27,250
beings. And I prefer the latter. That's
some kind of advanced human beings.

1868
01:50:27,251 --> 01:50:31,300
We're involved in a project
to disseminate a civilization.

1869
01:50:31,301 --> 01:50:34,730
I mentioned the Chicano in the Amazon who,

1870
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:39,190
who are big drinkers
of, of, of Iowasca. Uh,

1871
01:50:39,191 --> 01:50:42,150
the Takano have a fascinating origin myth.
Uh,

1872
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:47,220
they say that they're an origin myth
state specifically that their ancestors

1873
01:50:47,291 --> 01:50:49,090
were brought to the Amazon.

1874
01:50:49,210 --> 01:50:54,130
They were brought to the Amazon by a
group of supernaturals who included the

1875
01:50:54,131 --> 01:50:58,870
daughter of the sun and an individual
called the helmsmen who steered the

1876
01:50:58,871 --> 01:51:03,340
serpent canoe in which this settlement
mission in the Amazon was, was performed.

1877
01:51:03,341 --> 01:51:05,680
And what these so called
supernatural dead was,

1878
01:51:05,860 --> 01:51:09,670
they brought the ancestors of Decano to
the Amazon and they showed them the best

1879
01:51:09,671 --> 01:51:12,130
places to settle the
best places where they,

1880
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:15,040
where they might find hunting the best
places where they might create a village

1881
01:51:15,041 --> 01:51:18,070
of the best places for agriculture.
And then they left,

1882
01:51:18,610 --> 01:51:23,550
but they left them behind one gift
and that gift was Iowasca. Wow.

1883
01:51:23,650 --> 01:51:25,810
That's the story of the
origin myth of the Takano.

1884
01:51:25,990 --> 01:51:30,990
And it sounds to me rather like the other
side of the story of that DNA signal

1885
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:35,670
in the Amazon that a group of people
were deliberately settled, uh,

1886
01:51:35,740 --> 01:51:40,740
in the Amazon by human beings who they
chose to regard as a supernatural.

1887
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:44,680
That's what makes sense of it to me.
Um,

1888
01:51:44,681 --> 01:51:48,160
when I interrupted you to talk about
what's, or what were you about to say?

1889
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:51,410
I can't remember. I'm in
California. I've been smoking dope.

1890
01:51:54,590 --> 01:51:57,550
We were talking about different things
in the Amazon. Should we rewind?

1891
01:51:57,820 --> 01:52:01,250
We said the serpent. God, you were
talking about before quite so.

1892
01:52:01,251 --> 01:52:06,150
Quantile before that. Um, I have
another question. The omex did you,

1893
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:09,190
you were talking about the
genetics of these, um, uh,

1894
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:12,850
people that live in native
Americans that they vary widely,

1895
01:52:12,970 --> 01:52:17,860
but the old mex seemed to
have very similar features,
the thick lips and noses.

1896
01:52:18,100 --> 01:52:22,150
Why do we think that is?
Well, this is part of, uh,

1897
01:52:22,630 --> 01:52:27,250
a curious mystery that is not
unconnected to the genetic mystery.

1898
01:52:27,420 --> 01:52:27,670
Uh,

1899
01:52:27,670 --> 01:52:32,670
it's been known by archeologists for
quite a long time that there are anomalous

1900
01:52:32,980 --> 01:52:36,100
skulls, uh, in parts of Brazil,

1901
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:41,760
which appear to show a very strongly
Polynesian or African features,

1902
01:52:43,780 --> 01:52:48,080
very much like the features that we
see on the, on the all make heads.

1903
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:51,500
And a number of archeologists who got
into trouble with their colleagues for

1904
01:52:51,501 --> 01:52:56,190
this have used that to argue many
years ago, 30, 40 years ago, that,

1905
01:52:56,230 --> 01:53:01,230
that the settlement story of the Americas
is much more complicated than we've,

1906
01:53:01,370 --> 01:53:04,700
you know, then we, than we've
realized and, and what the,

1907
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:09,880
what the DNA is doing is it's telling
us that there was something really weird

1908
01:53:10,850 --> 01:53:15,740
happened, happened with settlement. They,
you see, what happened with those, um,

1909
01:53:16,340 --> 01:53:21,340
African or Polynesian looking skulls
was that they were tested for DNA.

1910
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:26,540
Uh, when DNA technology was
not as advanced as it is today.

1911
01:53:26,930 --> 01:53:31,310
And what that DNA showed was that they
were more closely related to modern

1912
01:53:31,311 --> 01:53:34,940
native Americans than they are
to any other people in the world.

1913
01:53:34,941 --> 01:53:39,170
So the notion that there was some
connection with Polynesia or Africa was

1914
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:40,033
dismissed,

1915
01:53:40,250 --> 01:53:45,250
but now that we have very firm evidence
of an Austrian lazy and genetic signal

1916
01:53:46,090 --> 01:53:47,720
or Australian aborigines,

1917
01:53:48,170 --> 01:53:51,560
Papua New Guinea Melanesians
with those kinds of features,

1918
01:53:51,561 --> 01:53:54,470
now that we have the genetic evidence
that is found in the amps and we have to

1919
01:53:54,471 --> 01:53:58,730
go back to that old evidence
and reconsider it. Wow. Yeah,

1920
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:02,960
I would love to find out what that is.
They've always fascinated me.

1921
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:06,990
The OMEX, it's always been
such a strange image. The,

1922
01:54:06,991 --> 01:54:09,770
the large heads with the helmets on them.

1923
01:54:09,770 --> 01:54:13,390
And how did they universally
look like that? I mean all the,

1924
01:54:13,391 --> 01:54:15,290
all of the features are very,
very similar.

1925
01:54:15,690 --> 01:54:19,580
They're very similar with the
helmets and almost always,

1926
01:54:19,581 --> 01:54:22,630
I won't claim that every single
Omac head has a helmet on it.

1927
01:54:22,631 --> 01:54:24,260
Cause I think I've seen one that didn't,

1928
01:54:24,261 --> 01:54:28,070
there's quite a while ago since
I explored the Almac area.

1929
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:30,140
But what's fascinating
about them is they are,

1930
01:54:30,170 --> 01:54:33,950
they are supposedly the first high
civilization of Central America that they

1931
01:54:33,951 --> 01:54:38,450
create structures on a massive scale that
you can see connections between them.

1932
01:54:38,451 --> 01:54:40,070
And the later,
the later Maya,

1933
01:54:40,071 --> 01:54:43,850
that whole mystery of the Mayan calendar
was clearly inherited from the all Max.

1934
01:54:43,851 --> 01:54:47,780
It wasn't something that Maya made up.
The all max use that same symbolism.

1935
01:54:47,781 --> 01:54:51,140
So the Mayan calendar is
actually an Almanac calendar.

1936
01:54:51,170 --> 01:54:55,520
And if we then consider the possibility
that the all macs may just be the latest,

1937
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:58,370
the earliest surviving
manifestation of that calendar,

1938
01:54:58,371 --> 01:55:00,470
it could go back much further than that.

1939
01:55:01,190 --> 01:55:05,510
Do you plan on having any debates
with people that oppose these ideas?

1940
01:55:06,250 --> 01:55:09,970
Um, well it was interesting
on your very show, Joe too,

1941
01:55:10,670 --> 01:55:13,430
to have the debate that
involved Michael Shermer,

1942
01:55:13,431 --> 01:55:17,210
who's the editor of the
skeptic magazine and um,

1943
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:22,660
some colleague of his who came in on
line who I got a bit annoyed with,

1944
01:55:23,210 --> 01:55:27,740
um, and um, myself and, uh,
my great friend and colleague,

1945
01:55:27,770 --> 01:55:30,380
the genius Randall Carlson, uh, and,

1946
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:34,700
and I felt that that was
a very useful debate.

1947
01:55:35,020 --> 01:55:39,350
Um, I felt that it's poss possibly
the first time that those of us on the

1948
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:43,470
alternative side of the argument about
history where we're given an opportunity

1949
01:55:43,471 --> 01:55:45,540
really to put our evidence forward and,

1950
01:55:45,541 --> 01:55:49,650
and to confront so-called
skeptics while it's so cold.

1951
01:55:49,651 --> 01:55:53,070
That's what he calls himself,
Michael Shermer with this evidence.

1952
01:55:53,071 --> 01:55:55,850
And obviously I'm biased,
but I,

1953
01:55:55,851 --> 01:56:00,630
I don't feel that he fielded
the situation particularly well.

1954
01:56:00,630 --> 01:56:04,350
I don't think mainstream mark LG
came out of that looking really good.

1955
01:56:04,410 --> 01:56:08,800
I think it came out of that looking
rather ignorant and uninformed.

1956
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:14,010
Uh, and, and a man like Michael
Shermer, who is a professional skeptic,

1957
01:56:14,210 --> 01:56:18,570
uh, cannot begin to match the knowledge
of a man like Randall Carlson who has

1958
01:56:18,571 --> 01:56:23,571
devoted his whole life to walking the
walk of the geology of the end of the ice

1959
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:28,020
age in, in, in North America. And
that showed on, on, on that debate.

1960
01:56:28,021 --> 01:56:30,690
So I think the debate was worth doing a,

1961
01:56:30,691 --> 01:56:35,310
I think it showed that the alternative
side isn't just wishy washy stuff out

1962
01:56:35,311 --> 01:56:36,570
there on the fringes of things,

1963
01:56:36,571 --> 01:56:39,870
that there are those of us working in
this field who are using really solid

1964
01:56:39,990 --> 01:56:40,920
information.

1965
01:56:40,950 --> 01:56:45,150
And who are who our project is to rewrite
history and we're not going to do that

1966
01:56:45,151 --> 01:56:48,420
with slight information.
It has to be solid information.

1967
01:56:48,430 --> 01:56:52,050
I think we had the opportunity
on your show to say that,

1968
01:56:52,051 --> 01:56:54,270
that that solid information is there.

1969
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:57,600
I'm not claiming it was a complete
victory for the alternative side.

1970
01:56:57,780 --> 01:57:01,530
Michael Shermer is a smart guy and he
put forward some good arguments to,

1971
01:57:01,710 --> 01:57:04,230
and there were constructive
aspects of that debate, which I,

1972
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:05,130
which I appreciate it.

1973
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:08,940
I'd like to see much more engagement
and much more positive approach.

1974
01:57:08,941 --> 01:57:11,790
I wished the skeptics
welcome to their skepticism,

1975
01:57:11,791 --> 01:57:16,050
but I wish they'd be less hateful,
less less full of derision, less,

1976
01:57:16,051 --> 01:57:17,160
less despising,

1977
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:21,330
or they're so defensive with their ideas
and and so and so defensive with their

1978
01:57:21,331 --> 01:57:23,850
ideas when the possibility is there for,

1979
01:57:23,870 --> 01:57:27,130
for a constructive debate, you know? Well,

1980
01:57:27,190 --> 01:57:31,600
what's interesting to me is that as this
evidence piles up and it seems to be

1981
01:57:31,601 --> 01:57:34,390
continuing to pile up as more like the,

1982
01:57:34,450 --> 01:57:39,450
the impact sites and more of this ancient
civilization material gets unearthed,

1983
01:57:42,610 --> 01:57:43,930
it's almost insurmountable.

1984
01:57:44,180 --> 01:57:47,270
Yeah. It's almost, and this is
how this is how paradigm shift,

1985
01:57:47,271 --> 01:57:51,380
I mean everybody is familiar with the
concept of a paradigm shift and there's a

1986
01:57:51,381 --> 01:57:54,800
book called the structure of
scientific revolutions by Thomas Kuhn,

1987
01:57:54,801 --> 01:57:57,110
which outlines what a paradigm shift is,

1988
01:57:57,111 --> 01:58:02,111
where an established model in some
discipline of science that has been in

1989
01:58:02,181 --> 01:58:06,800
control of people's thinking for a very
long time suddenly falls apart and it

1990
01:58:06,801 --> 01:58:07,670
doesn't fall apart.

1991
01:58:07,671 --> 01:58:12,080
Suddenly what happens is that there's
an accumulation of evidence which that

1992
01:58:12,081 --> 01:58:15,170
model cannot explain.
That paradigm cannot explain it.

1993
01:58:15,171 --> 01:58:17,360
It seemed like a great
paradigm at one point,

1994
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:21,140
but then it doesn't explain this
and then it doesn't explain like,

1995
01:58:21,410 --> 01:58:25,430
like the paradigm that says
that Megalithic architecture
is only 6,000 years old

1996
01:58:25,431 --> 01:58:29,330
and that the first megalithic architecture
was in Multa that can't explain the

1997
01:58:29,331 --> 01:58:34,250
massive Megalithic site of Quebec, Lee
Tempe and Turkey 5,500 years before that.

1998
01:58:34,460 --> 01:58:37,970
It's evidence like that the slow
accumulation of evidence that the existing

1999
01:58:37,971 --> 01:58:40,880
system cannot explain
that at eventual point,

2000
01:58:41,110 --> 01:58:45,220
no matter how strongly the advocates
of the existing system hold on to it,

2001
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:48,160
no matter how determined
they are in their defense,

2002
01:58:48,310 --> 01:58:52,360
no matter what dirty tricks they may
choose to deploy to undermine their

2003
01:58:52,361 --> 01:58:53,980
opponents,
sooner or later,

2004
01:58:53,981 --> 01:58:58,480
the evidence overwhelms them and the
paradigm goes down and you have a new way

2005
01:58:58,481 --> 01:59:01,840
of thinking and that that is the story of,
of science.

2006
01:59:01,841 --> 01:59:03,310
And it is a story that I think,

2007
01:59:03,311 --> 01:59:07,240
I think we're at a tipping point in our
understanding of the past of the human

2008
01:59:07,241 --> 01:59:10,810
species.
I am not saying that I am 100% right.

2009
01:59:11,110 --> 01:59:15,220
I believe that what I'm doing that's
worthwhile is I'm asking questions about

2010
01:59:15,221 --> 01:59:17,230
the past that haven't been asked enough.

2011
01:59:17,470 --> 01:59:19,520
I'm putting archeologist on the spot and,

2012
01:59:19,530 --> 01:59:23,440
and demanding that they
explain themselves. I don't,

2013
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:26,290
I don't claim that I'm right.
I'm offering an alternative theory.

2014
01:59:26,470 --> 01:59:29,170
And my objective is to get
people to think for themselves,

2015
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:33,760
to think about this stuff and not to
accept, uh, the voice of authority as the,

2016
01:59:33,761 --> 01:59:38,110
as the sole, uh, medium of truth.
That's, that's what I've tried to do.

2017
01:59:38,140 --> 01:59:40,730
Have you had any,
uh,

2018
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:44,880
archeologist review any of this
work and change their opinions? No.

2019
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:49,490
No I haven't. But what I, what
I have found, uh, and I've,

2020
01:59:49,550 --> 01:59:54,490
I've found it interestingly during the
research trips for America before a,

2021
01:59:54,491 --> 01:59:58,870
is a younger generation of
archeologists who are in the field. Um,

2022
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:03,010
and they are quite different from the
older generation of archeologists who are

2023
02:00:03,011 --> 02:00:05,710
running the whole scene
25 years ago or now.

2024
02:00:05,711 --> 02:00:08,740
We have a very different
younger generation and younger
generation that has been

2025
02:00:08,741 --> 02:00:13,660
exposed to open minded thinking, um,
that has been exposed to the Internet.

2026
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:17,350
That itself as part of the general
pattern of the younger generation is

2027
02:00:17,351 --> 02:00:21,250
suspicious of authority. I'm meeting
young archeologist on sites. For example,

2028
02:00:21,251 --> 02:00:24,280
I met a couple of really
amazing young minds, uh,

2029
02:00:24,281 --> 02:00:28,930
on a site called Blackwater
draw, uh, in, um, uh,

2030
02:00:29,080 --> 02:00:32,920
Arizona and New Mexico where,
where the one of the first Clovis sites,

2031
02:00:32,990 --> 02:00:37,140
the young archeologist I met there
were incredibly open minded and,

2032
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:41,560
and really willing to
consider extraordinary
possibilities about the past and

2033
02:00:41,561 --> 02:00:45,040
privately admitted to me that
they'd read my books. Well,

2034
02:00:45,041 --> 02:00:46,540
that's where I get the hope.

2035
02:00:46,541 --> 02:00:49,420
I get the hope in this young generation
that is growing up with the Internet

2036
02:00:49,421 --> 02:00:53,230
that does understand that there's a lot
more out there than just what they're

2037
02:00:53,231 --> 02:00:57,190
being taught in schools. Yes. Yeah.
Isn't this, is this, this is where the,

2038
02:00:57,240 --> 02:01:01,780
where the hope lies and it lies in, in
every area. And it's why one of the,

2039
02:01:01,900 --> 02:01:06,670
one of the intriguing things that has
happened with me and your show is an

2040
02:01:06,671 --> 02:01:11,500
important part of this is that when
I go around giving public events,

2041
02:01:11,530 --> 02:01:15,160
doing a public presentation of my work,

2042
02:01:15,610 --> 02:01:18,640
the demography of the audiences
is extremely interesting.

2043
02:01:18,640 --> 02:01:20,950
And this is true whether I'm
giving the talk in Britain,

2044
02:01:20,951 --> 02:01:24,010
whether I'm giving it in Canada,
whether I'm giving it in America.

2045
02:01:24,310 --> 02:01:29,310
Part of the audience are older people
who read me in the 1990s who got onto my

2046
02:01:29,471 --> 02:01:33,310
work with fingerprints of the Gods in
1995 and they've stuck with me and they've

2047
02:01:33,311 --> 02:01:37,210
carried on reading my work.
But another part of the audience,

2048
02:01:37,211 --> 02:01:42,110
and a very big part of the
audience consists to a large
extent of young people,

2049
02:01:42,140 --> 02:01:45,230
most of whom are men,
but there are women amongst them as well.

2050
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:50,680
And what those mainly young men come up
to me and say at the end of the event is

2051
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:57,400
we first encountered your work on Joe
Rogan's show and it completely opened our

2052
02:01:57,651 --> 02:02:02,540
minds. It changed it. I've had so many
young men say, this has changed my life.

2053
02:02:02,870 --> 02:02:03,920
And then I asked myself,
well,

2054
02:02:03,921 --> 02:02:07,580
why should a different take on
the past change people's lives?

2055
02:02:07,580 --> 02:02:10,520
Why should people feel that their lives
have been changed by a different take on

2056
02:02:10,521 --> 02:02:14,650
the past, which I add they would not know
about unless you had the good grace to,

2057
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:17,630
to bring me on the, on, on your show.
This, these ideas would not be known,

2058
02:02:17,631 --> 02:02:20,690
but they are known because of the
amazing outreach of your show.

2059
02:02:20,900 --> 02:02:23,000
And the answer to that question,
why does it,

2060
02:02:23,060 --> 02:02:28,060
why does it change a person's life is
that once we realize that we have been

2061
02:02:29,361 --> 02:02:32,630
misinformed about our past,

2062
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:34,430
that everything that we've built,

2063
02:02:34,431 --> 02:02:39,431
our idea of who we are upon and of where
we're going as a culture may be founded

2064
02:02:39,950 --> 02:02:44,420
on false hoods and perhaps
even deliberate lies.

2065
02:02:44,660 --> 02:02:46,370
Once that is realized,

2066
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:50,750
then all the questions about the nature
of the society we live in become open.

2067
02:02:50,970 --> 02:02:52,310
Uh, and, and people,

2068
02:02:52,460 --> 02:02:56,990
young people are feeling the need
to take an independent path, not to,

2069
02:02:57,020 --> 02:03:00,840
not to follow the path that has
been set down for them, uh, by,

2070
02:03:00,910 --> 02:03:05,330
by previous generations. And in some
way, and I'm very gratified to hear this,

2071
02:03:05,331 --> 02:03:09,320
the fact that I am an elder
now, I'm 69 next, next birthday.

2072
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:14,210
The fact that I look great. Thank
you. The fact that I as an elder, um,

2073
02:03:14,300 --> 02:03:17,960
have consistently pursued
an independent past part,

2074
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:23,020
have been willing to put up with the
shit that's been thrown at me over the

2075
02:03:23,990 --> 02:03:28,190
years, but have stuck to my guns and have
continued to add new information to the

2076
02:03:28,191 --> 02:03:30,890
dossier of information that I put forward.
That is,

2077
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:34,760
and I'm encouraged to see this, that's
founders inspiring by younger people.

2078
02:03:34,761 --> 02:03:35,240
And what,

2079
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:40,190
what better gift could an old guy hope
to leave to the world than a younger

2080
02:03:40,191 --> 02:03:44,300
generation who feel inspired by that
person's work to change the world? Well,

2081
02:03:44,301 --> 02:03:45,260
I'm very,

2082
02:03:45,261 --> 02:03:49,220
very thankful that I could introduce
people to you because your first book that

2083
02:03:49,221 --> 02:03:53,270
I read of you, fingerprints of the Gods
changed my view of the world. I mean,

2084
02:03:53,271 --> 02:03:56,480
I remember putting that book down
after I was finished and going, wow,

2085
02:03:57,390 --> 02:04:02,150
if he's right and like this whole
thing is a mess. Yeah. A complete mess.

2086
02:04:02,570 --> 02:04:07,010
Big because our idea of who we are is
very much founded in our idea of who we

2087
02:04:07,011 --> 02:04:08,950
were. And, and one of the,

2088
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:13,400
I think one of the mistakes that's
made in our civilization is that, uh,

2089
02:04:13,910 --> 02:04:18,530
we are very conceited with very big
headed and we tend to review the v view,

2090
02:04:18,531 --> 02:04:22,990
the whole story of history as though it's
a project that leads to us that we're

2091
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:27,440
what it's all about. And I
think what is, um, what is,

2092
02:04:27,441 --> 02:04:31,250
uh, how can I put it undermining
of the existing system,

2093
02:04:31,610 --> 02:04:35,890
about a new take on the past is the,

2094
02:04:35,891 --> 02:04:40,170
is is the notion we're not
what it's all about at all. Uh,

2095
02:04:40,171 --> 02:04:44,190
that there may have been an earlier
civilization that reached a high level of

2096
02:04:44,191 --> 02:04:46,740
advancement, perhaps different
from ours, but nevertheless,

2097
02:04:46,741 --> 02:04:48,030
an advanced civilization,

2098
02:04:48,300 --> 02:04:52,980
which was just taken out of the story
completely by a global cataclysm.

2099
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:57,390
Uh, then we suddenly, we suddenly realized
that in a way we're here accidentally,

2100
02:04:57,391 --> 02:05:00,770
that it's not been a process
that's been all about us. Uh,

2101
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:03,780
and that if we'd been misinformed
about how we got here,

2102
02:05:03,781 --> 02:05:08,100
then we need to get the true information
about, about what's going on. So,

2103
02:05:08,220 --> 02:05:12,600
so these are, um, in a way, profoundly
revolutionary ideas. They do,

2104
02:05:12,601 --> 02:05:16,920
they do lead people on a path of inquiry
that leads to questioning of everything

2105
02:05:17,410 --> 02:05:22,410
and our fears that you were
just discussing earlier
about how soft we are in

2106
02:05:23,291 --> 02:05:27,880
comparison to past civilizations in terms
of our ability to live off the land.

2107
02:05:28,330 --> 02:05:30,610
That's one aspect that bothers me.

2108
02:05:30,611 --> 02:05:33,880
But one of the big ones that bothers me
is the fact that everything is digital.

2109
02:05:34,150 --> 02:05:38,770
All of our information is stored on hard
drives. You Bet. And if that goes down,

2110
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:43,240
there's not much left. You have
paper books and, and you know,

2111
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:47,590
a few thousands of years,
imagine what will be left. Yeah,

2112
02:05:47,650 --> 02:05:49,900
we would lose all of our advancement.

2113
02:05:50,130 --> 02:05:53,400
Well, I can, I can speak to this
at a, at a, at a personal level.

2114
02:05:53,430 --> 02:05:56,520
There was a time when I was
an excellent map reader.

2115
02:05:57,210 --> 02:06:01,530
I could navigate anywhere
with, with maps, you know,

2116
02:06:01,531 --> 02:06:05,890
my wife Santha and I did huge journeys
in Mexico back in the early 1990s in

2117
02:06:06,120 --> 02:06:08,880
really cheap hire cars with maps.

2118
02:06:08,910 --> 02:06:13,910
And we found our way everywhere without
any problem today I can hardly use a

2119
02:06:14,431 --> 02:06:19,350
map. The skill of using a map has
lapsed within me. Why? Because of GPS,

2120
02:06:19,740 --> 02:06:22,440
GPS technology has come along and it's,
and it,

2121
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:27,250
it always tells me where I
am and being a bit lazy, uh,

2122
02:06:27,380 --> 02:06:29,670
I just accept that,
that technology,

2123
02:06:29,671 --> 02:06:34,050
but then I had caused to us myself
this just the other day. Supposing gps,

2124
02:06:34,051 --> 02:06:37,290
supposing all the satellites go down
and there's no gps is the whole,

2125
02:06:37,470 --> 02:06:41,170
the whole industrialized human race
is going to suddenly be lost. Uh,

2126
02:06:41,230 --> 02:06:45,030
all those Uber drivers who don't know
their way from a to B and who rely

2127
02:06:45,031 --> 02:06:48,450
entirely on their gps is they weren't,
no, they won't know where they're going.

2128
02:06:48,451 --> 02:06:52,020
And it's, and it's true with digital
data. The digital digital data,

2129
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:56,950
unlike unlike print data
is I'm very fragile, uh,

2130
02:06:57,220 --> 02:07:01,380
and requires programs in order to
access and interpret it that a much more

2131
02:07:01,381 --> 02:07:04,590
complicated than simply cracking
the code of a, a lost language

2132
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:08,200
mean the programs vary between
different phone platform. Exactly.

2133
02:07:08,201 --> 02:07:12,900
They very computer platforms. It's
just, it's so fragile and it's so,

2134
02:07:13,510 --> 02:07:13,871
I mean,

2135
02:07:13,871 --> 02:07:16,540
I don't know if there's any precautions
that have been taking place to preserve

2136
02:07:16,541 --> 02:07:20,800
this information in case of like what
Robert Schoch described coronal mass

2137
02:07:20,801 --> 02:07:21,730
ejection or something,

2138
02:07:21,790 --> 02:07:24,040
then click down all the satellites.
Yeah. No, I don't think,

2139
02:07:24,041 --> 02:07:26,770
I don't think preparation has been
made and I don't, and I don't.

2140
02:07:26,771 --> 02:07:31,750
And it's very clear that that preparation
is not being made for the risk of

2141
02:07:32,080 --> 02:07:35,950
another cosmic impact. Uh, and again,

2142
02:07:35,951 --> 02:07:39,460
a point that I'd like to make
about this is that we are at,

2143
02:07:40,090 --> 02:07:44,760
we are in a sense in a place where
history can repeat itself, uh,

2144
02:07:44,770 --> 02:07:47,860
that there are certain cycles at work.
Uh,

2145
02:07:47,861 --> 02:07:51,670
the work on the comet impact 12,000,
800 years ago.

2146
02:07:51,970 --> 02:07:56,970
How has very clearly and specifically
identified the Deborah trail of that

2147
02:07:57,251 --> 02:07:57,970
comment.

2148
02:07:57,970 --> 02:08:02,970
And that Deborah trail is the Taurid
meteor stream and it's called the Taurid

2149
02:08:03,011 --> 02:08:06,340
meteor stream because it
appears to emanate from the
region of the sky in which

2150
02:08:06,341 --> 02:08:10,960
the constellation of tourists sets. It
doesn't, it's within our solar system.

2151
02:08:10,961 --> 02:08:12,160
It's an optical illusion.

2152
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:17,020
The Taurid meteor stream is
a giant complex of debris.

2153
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:21,310
Uh,
it is 30 million kilometers wide.

2154
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:26,080
What you had was an original comment
that might've been a hundred to 200

2155
02:08:26,081 --> 02:08:28,270
kilometers in diameter,
a small moon,

2156
02:08:28,540 --> 02:08:32,350
which fragmented and broken up
into multiple, multiple parts.

2157
02:08:32,710 --> 02:08:36,760
And those parts began to spread out along
the whole orbit of the Taurid meteor

2158
02:08:36,761 --> 02:08:39,520
stream and to widen the
whole thing widened.

2159
02:08:39,521 --> 02:08:43,810
So it's like a giant tube of debris and
the evidence and the argument is that

2160
02:08:43,811 --> 02:08:45,520
12,000,
800 years ago,

2161
02:08:45,610 --> 02:08:50,260
several large bits of that debris fell
out of the Taurid meteor stream and

2162
02:08:50,261 --> 02:08:51,730
impacted with the earth.

2163
02:08:51,970 --> 02:08:56,970
The problem is that the Taurid meteor
stream still exists and our planets still

2164
02:08:56,981 --> 02:08:59,770
passes through it twice a year.
Uh,

2165
02:08:59,771 --> 02:09:03,250
and those passages take place
in June and in November.

2166
02:09:03,320 --> 02:09:08,320
And each passage takes 12 and a half
days and the same group of scientists who

2167
02:09:08,381 --> 02:09:13,360
are, who are looking at the evidence for
the impacts 12,800 years ago are deeply

2168
02:09:13,361 --> 02:09:17,740
concerned that we may face future
impacts from the tour with meteor stream.

2169
02:09:17,740 --> 02:09:21,430
That there are still large objects up
there. This is not theory, this is a fact.

2170
02:09:21,431 --> 02:09:24,510
There's a comment up there,
uh, called [inaudible],

2171
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:26,830
which is part of the Taurid meteor stream.

2172
02:09:26,860 --> 02:09:31,060
It's a large fragment of the original
giant comic comic Danky has a diameter of,

2173
02:09:31,061 --> 02:09:33,340
I don't know, five or five
or six kilometers. There's,

2174
02:09:33,341 --> 02:09:38,341
there's 19 recognized huge objects within
the Taurid meteor stream calculations

2175
02:09:38,681 --> 02:09:42,910
indicate that there may be as much as
200 asteroids within the Taurid meteor

2176
02:09:42,911 --> 02:09:45,610
stream of a diameter
of a kilometer or more,

2177
02:09:45,611 --> 02:09:47,710
which would have
catastrophic effect if they,

2178
02:09:47,740 --> 02:09:51,820
if they hit the earth and responsible
astronomers regard the Taurid meteor

2179
02:09:51,821 --> 02:09:55,090
stream as the greatest collision hazard
facing mankind at the present time.

2180
02:09:55,600 --> 02:10:00,070
And it's not something that we need to
fall into despair about because it's

2181
02:10:00,071 --> 02:10:04,510
perfectly within the level of our
technology to do something about it.

2182
02:10:04,570 --> 02:10:07,360
What could they do? Well,
to give you an example,

2183
02:10:07,390 --> 02:10:10,960
a commercial interests are looking right
now and the technology is there to mine

2184
02:10:10,961 --> 02:10:13,120
asteroids.
We can go to asteroids if the,

2185
02:10:13,121 --> 02:10:17,290
if the commercial interest is high enough,
we can go to them, we can mine them,

2186
02:10:17,291 --> 02:10:19,480
we can extract minerals,
we can bring them back to the earth.

2187
02:10:19,870 --> 02:10:24,400
The same technology would allow you
to move asteroids or comet fragments.

2188
02:10:24,401 --> 02:10:27,040
You don't want to blow
them up with a nuke.

2189
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:30,460
That would be a really bad idea
that would, that would, uh,

2190
02:10:30,490 --> 02:10:35,420
turn the one large object
into multiple smaller objects,

2191
02:10:35,421 --> 02:10:38,220
which could cause equally
massive devastation and,

2192
02:10:38,221 --> 02:10:41,300
and would be very difficult to predict
where that devastation was going to fall.

2193
02:10:41,660 --> 02:10:45,800
What you want to do is to nudge them
and move them out of the dangerous orbit

2194
02:10:45,801 --> 02:10:48,050
into, into a less
dangerous Orbitz. And, and,

2195
02:10:48,051 --> 02:10:49,940
and the evidence is in the next 30 years,

2196
02:10:49,941 --> 02:10:53,270
we are going to be passing through
dangerous filaments of the toward meteor

2197
02:10:53,271 --> 02:10:54,620
stream.
And if we were smart,

2198
02:10:54,830 --> 02:10:58,940
we would be devoting some resources
to protecting our cosmic environment.

2199
02:10:58,940 --> 02:11:02,210
Just as we, there are many issues
that we need to devote resources to.

2200
02:11:02,510 --> 02:11:03,620
Unfortunately,

2201
02:11:03,770 --> 02:11:08,520
the one that's most attractive to our
politicians at the moment is warfare. Uh,

2202
02:11:08,540 --> 02:11:13,540
we devote limitless resources to
technologies of mass destruction.

2203
02:11:14,020 --> 02:11:14,201
There.

2204
02:11:14,201 --> 02:11:18,290
There really is no end to the amount
that we are prepared to spend on that in

2205
02:11:18,291 --> 02:11:19,940
terms of our so called security.

2206
02:11:19,941 --> 02:11:23,960
We feel somehow we're making ourselves
more secure by having these incredible

2207
02:11:23,961 --> 02:11:27,200
weapons and spending
trillions of dollars on them.

2208
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:30,320
But the cosmos doesn't give
a fuck about any of that.

2209
02:11:30,470 --> 02:11:34,870
The Cosmos is out there with these,
with these giant, giant objects, uh,

2210
02:11:34,940 --> 02:11:39,940
which have a far greater explosive power
than all the nuclear weapons are stored

2211
02:11:41,181 --> 02:11:44,600
on earth at the, at the present
time, the comet shoemaker, Levy nine,

2212
02:11:44,601 --> 02:11:49,601
which hit Jupiter in 1994 had a total
calculated explosive power of 300

2213
02:11:50,841 --> 02:11:51,674
gigatons.

2214
02:11:51,800 --> 02:11:55,670
If you took the entire nuclear arsenal
of the world today and blew it all up at

2215
02:11:55,671 --> 02:11:58,250
once,
it would yield 6.4 gigatons.

2216
02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:03,110
So these objects are producing
catastrophic results on a scale that far,

2217
02:12:03,111 --> 02:12:06,590
far beyond anything that we ourselves
could do with nuclear weapons. It's time.

2218
02:12:06,591 --> 02:12:11,390
We spent a bit less time and money on
weapons of mass destruction and a bit more

2219
02:12:11,391 --> 02:12:14,540
on looking after this beautiful
garden that we call the earth.

2220
02:12:14,570 --> 02:12:18,020
And that is our home and it will be the
home of our children and our children's

2221
02:12:18,021 --> 02:12:21,170
children. I'm a grandfather now.
I feel passionately about this.

2222
02:12:21,380 --> 02:12:23,000
We need to look after this planet.

2223
02:12:23,030 --> 02:12:27,470
It's our responsibility as a human species
to do so. And one of the challenges,

2224
02:12:27,471 --> 02:12:30,410
it's not the only challenge. There
are many, many other challenges.

2225
02:12:30,620 --> 02:12:35,120
One of the challenges is to pay attention
to our cosmic environment and to

2226
02:12:35,121 --> 02:12:40,121
realize that the cosmos can intervene
cataclysmically in the human story.

2227
02:12:41,060 --> 02:12:44,570
And that the Taurid meteor stream in
particular may have been a hidden hand in

2228
02:12:44,571 --> 02:12:48,170
human history that there may have been
other impacts in the last 13,000 years

2229
02:12:48,380 --> 02:12:52,550
that affect have affected and changed
the course of humanity on this earth.

2230
02:12:52,670 --> 02:12:56,580
And the ancients were very good at
paying attention to the sky. Uh,

2231
02:12:56,590 --> 02:12:59,720
we ourselves have amazing
tech to study the sky,

2232
02:12:59,721 --> 02:13:03,650
but for some reason we're ignoring
this problem of cosmic impacts.

2233
02:13:03,651 --> 02:13:06,860
And that's incredibly irresponsible
because as I said a moment ago,

2234
02:13:06,861 --> 02:13:11,270
it is a solvable problem.
It is within the limits of our technology.

2235
02:13:11,450 --> 02:13:16,130
It would require a global cooperative
effort to sweep our cosmic environment

2236
02:13:16,131 --> 02:13:16,730
clean,

2237
02:13:16,730 --> 02:13:20,690
but it could be done and a side product
of that global corporation might be a

2238
02:13:20,691 --> 02:13:25,190
friendlier, more nurturing, more
loving, more positive human community.

2239
02:13:25,840 --> 02:13:29,840
It is very odd that we have
this infant towel nature,

2240
02:13:29,841 --> 02:13:33,480
even as grown adults and
world leaders that we don't,

2241
02:13:33,481 --> 02:13:36,150
we do like to nor eminent danger.

2242
02:13:36,450 --> 02:13:38,910
As long as it hasn't affected
us in the past, there's,

2243
02:13:39,660 --> 02:13:44,660
there's no real moment we can point
to other than tongue goose Gha in,

2244
02:13:44,910 --> 02:13:46,200
you know,
photographic history,

2245
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:49,490
modern history where you
could take pictures of things.
When we had a gentleman,

2246
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:50,010
if I can,

2247
02:13:50,010 --> 02:13:54,120
if I can pull up on that very point
that the evidence is compelling that the

2248
02:13:54,121 --> 02:13:58,470
Tunguska event was an object then fell
out of the Taurid meteor stream that

2249
02:13:58,471 --> 02:14:01,530
happened at the peak of the
beat of tourists in June,

2250
02:14:01,530 --> 02:14:06,530
1900 and eight that it is extremely
likely that that Tunguska object came from

2251
02:14:07,471 --> 02:14:10,290
the Taurid meteor stream because we
were passing through the Taurid meteor

2252
02:14:10,291 --> 02:14:14,970
stream at exactly that time and what
the tango Ska object is estimated to be

2253
02:14:15,300 --> 02:14:19,590
between 60 and 190 meters in diameter.
So it's not a very big object.

2254
02:14:19,591 --> 02:14:23,250
It's not a kilometer scale object.
It's a, it's, it's, it's big,

2255
02:14:23,370 --> 02:14:26,820
but it's not that big. It doesn't
even hit the earth. It's an Airburst.

2256
02:14:26,970 --> 02:14:31,970
It explodes in the sky above fortunately
and uninhabited area of Siberia.

2257
02:14:33,571 --> 02:14:35,700
But the devastation is huge.

2258
02:14:35,730 --> 02:14:39,720
It wasn't even noticed for some years
afterwards until scientific teams went in

2259
02:14:39,721 --> 02:14:43,710
and studied the area and discovered
that 80 million trees across 2000 square

2260
02:14:43,711 --> 02:14:47,710
kilometers had been completely
flattened by that airburst. Uh,

2261
02:14:47,770 --> 02:14:51,750
and to put that in context, 2000 square
kilometers is the size of London.

2262
02:14:51,930 --> 02:14:56,040
So anybody who knows London is aware
that there's a ring road around London

2263
02:14:56,041 --> 02:14:59,910
called the m 25 if that air best
had taken place over central London,

2264
02:14:59,940 --> 02:15:04,260
everything of London out as far as the
m 25 would have been gone completely.

2265
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:07,800
Is that what it looks like
today? Great. Pretty close to,

2266
02:15:07,801 --> 02:15:12,050
there's like a hundred years later,
there's no trees and if you've got,

2267
02:15:12,070 --> 02:15:13,320
you're looking at above there,

2268
02:15:13,321 --> 02:15:16,520
you're looking at the black and whites
that were taken in the early 19 hundreds.

2269
02:15:16,550 --> 02:15:20,790
God, yeah. Which, which revealed the
extent of this, uh, of this damage.

2270
02:15:20,791 --> 02:15:24,060
So it's just stupid of us not to
pay a bit more attention to this,

2271
02:15:24,061 --> 02:15:28,410
especially when we have the
tech to actually do something
about it. We have that,

2272
02:15:28,620 --> 02:15:33,330
that nature though, when it comes to
climate designee, a curious denial,

2273
02:15:33,600 --> 02:15:38,090
there's a denial of the role of
cataclysms in the human story. And there,

2274
02:15:38,091 --> 02:15:42,990
there is even a word for that in, in
science and it's called uniformitarianism.

2275
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:43,411
And,

2276
02:15:43,411 --> 02:15:47,760
and this is a particular philosophy of
science where the view is that everything

2277
02:15:47,761 --> 02:15:51,210
is, we see it in the world today
is how things have always been.

2278
02:15:51,390 --> 02:15:55,740
So if we don't see cataclysms today and
they're not playing a major part in our

2279
02:15:55,741 --> 02:15:56,574
story today,

2280
02:15:56,790 --> 02:16:01,140
then there weren't cataclysms and they
didn't play a major part in our story in

2281
02:16:01,141 --> 02:16:04,590
the past. That's why, although it's
before the time of human beings,

2282
02:16:04,830 --> 02:16:09,300
when the evidence that the dinosaurs
were made extinct by a comet or an

2283
02:16:09,301 --> 02:16:14,100
asteroid, a first came out, um,
Lewis and Walter Alvarez, the father,

2284
02:16:14,130 --> 02:16:17,970
son team who were behind that science
were ridiculed by their colleagues and

2285
02:16:17,971 --> 02:16:20,970
they were telling us absolutely absurd.
Of course,

2286
02:16:20,971 --> 02:16:23,880
no cosmic event could have
made the dinosaurs extinct.

2287
02:16:23,881 --> 02:16:27,900
They spent 10 years taking that ridicule
until they found the crater in the Gulf

2288
02:16:27,901 --> 02:16:29,500
of Mexico.
Since then,

2289
02:16:29,740 --> 02:16:34,360
the whole scientific community has
accepted that the course of life on this

2290
02:16:34,361 --> 02:16:38,920
planet was radically
changed by a cosmic impact.

2291
02:16:38,980 --> 02:16:41,050
And you know,
I like to joke about it,

2292
02:16:41,051 --> 02:16:45,580
but it was a cosmic impact that was big
enough literally to turn dinosaurs into

2293
02:16:45,581 --> 02:16:49,990
chickens because that's what's left
of the time. So align is, you know,

2294
02:16:50,110 --> 02:16:53,020
the birds.
And at the same time,

2295
02:16:53,800 --> 02:16:58,300
skulking in those prime evil forests is
this little mammal and it looks a bit

2296
02:16:58,301 --> 02:17:02,890
like a shrew,
a 65 million years ago going nowhere.

2297
02:17:03,460 --> 02:17:06,730
The dinosaurs ruled the earth,
then the cosmos intervenes.

2298
02:17:06,760 --> 02:17:09,130
The dinosaurs are swept out of the way.
And what happens,

2299
02:17:09,131 --> 02:17:13,090
the mammals start to evolve very rapidly
and they start to occupy niches that

2300
02:17:13,091 --> 02:17:17,470
were previously closed to them. And the
bottom line is we would not be here.

2301
02:17:17,471 --> 02:17:18,970
The human species would not be here.

2302
02:17:18,971 --> 02:17:22,360
We would not be having this conversation
if the dinosaurs had not been made

2303
02:17:22,361 --> 02:17:27,250
extinct 65 million years ago. Uh,
so these are world changing events.

2304
02:17:27,251 --> 02:17:32,251
And my argument is that such a world
changing event occurred between twelve

2305
02:17:32,290 --> 02:17:32,651
thousand eight hundred and eleven
thousand six hundred years ago,

2306
02:17:32,651 --> 02:17:35,230
and it's high time.
We paid more attention to it.

2307
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:40,880
Is there any evidence that there was
other species of human beings that existed

2308
02:17:41,250 --> 02:17:42,450
in the Americas,

2309
02:17:42,480 --> 02:17:47,480
like we're finding in Russia and there's
many of them that are being discovered

2310
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:52,530
all over the world now,
these subspecies of human beings.

2311
02:17:52,740 --> 02:17:56,990
Yeah. Um, this is, uh, an
issue that I go into in,

2312
02:17:56,991 --> 02:17:58,110
in America before.

2313
02:17:58,860 --> 02:18:03,860
And what first drew me into it
was Dennis over K in Siberia.

2314
02:18:04,740 --> 02:18:07,140
I think everybody's head of the
neanderthals and these days,

2315
02:18:07,141 --> 02:18:09,120
I think everybody's head
of the Denisovans as well.

2316
02:18:09,121 --> 02:18:12,060
A lot of people have a lot of, well,
I guess a lot of people haven't, but,

2317
02:18:12,090 --> 02:18:14,460
but first of all,
let's take the neanderthals.

2318
02:18:14,910 --> 02:18:17,730
For a long time it was held that
the neanderthals were stupid,

2319
02:18:17,731 --> 02:18:21,330
primitive subhumans
shambling lacking symbolism.

2320
02:18:21,690 --> 02:18:23,430
Turns out that that's not true at all.

2321
02:18:23,460 --> 02:18:27,300
The latest scientific evidence on the
neanderthals is that they were symbolic

2322
02:18:27,301 --> 02:18:30,780
creatures. That they did do art,
that they were in every sense human,

2323
02:18:30,781 --> 02:18:35,280
and they were in every sense human because
anatomically modern humans interbred

2324
02:18:35,310 --> 02:18:37,980
with neanderthals,
you can't interbreed with another species.

2325
02:18:38,300 --> 02:18:42,810
They clearly were a human human beings,
but they looked rather different from us.

2326
02:18:42,810 --> 02:18:47,810
And that's why certain populations in
the world today still have three to 5% of

2327
02:18:48,301 --> 02:18:52,110
Neanderthal DNA.
Then in Russia,

2328
02:18:52,140 --> 02:18:56,940
in Dennis serve a cave, they find a
single pinky bone from a little finger.

2329
02:18:57,300 --> 02:19:00,150
And, uh, they do the DNA testing on it.

2330
02:19:00,151 --> 02:19:02,670
They're able to get a
complete a genome from it.

2331
02:19:02,940 --> 02:19:05,460
And what they discover is
this isn't in the, and Athol,

2332
02:19:05,670 --> 02:19:10,560
this isn't an anatomically modern human
being. This is another human species, uh,

2333
02:19:10,590 --> 02:19:12,620
who they named the Denisovans.

2334
02:19:12,750 --> 02:19:15,660
They think they're more closely related
to neanderthals than they are to

2335
02:19:15,661 --> 02:19:18,990
anatomically modern humans, but they're
clearly and other human species.

2336
02:19:19,230 --> 02:19:24,230
And they also interbred with anatomically
modern humans and Denisovan DNA

2337
02:19:24,751 --> 02:19:26,700
survives,
interestingly enough,

2338
02:19:26,730 --> 02:19:30,690
it's a predominantly in Australasia,
uh,

2339
02:19:30,780 --> 02:19:34,700
in Papua New Guinea and
amongst Australian aborigines.

2340
02:19:35,030 --> 02:19:39,620
So as part of the research for this book,
I went to Dennis have a cave.

2341
02:19:39,790 --> 02:19:43,820
I had an amazing, actually just
incredible trip to Russia. I hadn't,

2342
02:19:43,880 --> 02:19:47,600
I hadn't expected it to be like
that at all. Siberia. I mean,

2343
02:19:47,601 --> 02:19:51,500
America is vast, but my
God, crossing Siberia,

2344
02:19:51,501 --> 02:19:55,910
this endless rolling plains,
you know, this just vast area.

2345
02:19:55,940 --> 02:19:59,470
How did you cross it?
We took a car, a w well,

2346
02:19:59,630 --> 02:20:02,870
you can't travel independently in Russia.
It's very difficult. You have to get,

2347
02:20:02,871 --> 02:20:06,710
you have to get permission and you have
to state in advance where you're going

2348
02:20:06,711 --> 02:20:09,950
to be stopping off that. So
what I found, and I just did,

2349
02:20:09,951 --> 02:20:14,630
so through the Internet was a, was a
local guy called Sergey Corgan, um,

2350
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:19,550
who had a little tour business,
um, in, in, in, in Siberia,

2351
02:20:19,551 --> 02:20:22,970
in the city of novel Sybil risk.
I got in touch with him.

2352
02:20:23,750 --> 02:20:27,200
He found a translator who would
translate my emails and I said,

2353
02:20:27,201 --> 02:20:31,670
we want to make this journey to Dennis
over cave and can you set this up for us

2354
02:20:31,671 --> 02:20:34,910
and get all the permissions. And, and
he did. And so we flew into novice,

2355
02:20:34,911 --> 02:20:38,620
a bisque Sergei and his
translator who turned out to be a,

2356
02:20:38,670 --> 02:20:41,900
a Russian student who spoke good English,
joined us.

2357
02:20:42,140 --> 02:20:45,920
And we did this immense
journey across Siberia. Oh,

2358
02:20:45,921 --> 02:20:49,160
it took us three days to get to, to
get to Dennis over cave, three days,

2359
02:20:49,730 --> 02:20:52,300
three days of driving every day.
Some stopping off along the way.

2360
02:20:52,350 --> 02:20:55,400
Incredible hospitality of the,
of, of the Russians that we were,

2361
02:20:55,430 --> 02:20:57,470
we're amongst very independent people,

2362
02:20:57,680 --> 02:21:00,830
people who are living out there in
the wilderness and who actually do,

2363
02:21:01,070 --> 02:21:02,060
do know how to survive.

2364
02:21:02,061 --> 02:21:04,910
As the first time I've ever
drank milk fresh from the cow,

2365
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:08,930
literally milked right out of the
cow and poured down my throat. I was,

2366
02:21:09,110 --> 02:21:12,680
it was delicious. And the cream,
I mean thick, thick cream.

2367
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:16,910
So it was a lot of things about Russia
that surprised me. Dennis over caves.

2368
02:21:16,911 --> 02:21:19,700
A fascinating, beautiful
place to visit. It's another,

2369
02:21:19,701 --> 02:21:23,900
it's another example of a missing chapter
in the human story that is beginning

2370
02:21:23,901 --> 02:21:27,230
to be pieced together.
It's obvious now that we were not alone,

2371
02:21:27,290 --> 02:21:31,430
that there were multiple
other human species who were
human enough to interbreed

2372
02:21:31,431 --> 02:21:33,710
with us and leave leave DNA.

2373
02:21:33,770 --> 02:21:37,160
And there's Dennis [inaudible] species
was only discovered in like, was it 2000?

2374
02:21:37,161 --> 02:21:42,070
So I'm very recently the 2007. It's a
very, it's a very recent discovery and,

2375
02:21:42,100 --> 02:21:46,070
and it's a little behind art. Hmm. Did
they leave behind art better than that?

2376
02:21:46,100 --> 02:21:50,150
They left behind, um,
certain physical objects,

2377
02:21:50,450 --> 02:21:52,640
which are extremely hard to explain.

2378
02:21:53,060 --> 02:21:57,310
One of them is a green stone bracelet.
Uh,

2379
02:21:57,311 --> 02:21:59,960
and that bracelet is
in the form of a talk,

2380
02:22:00,170 --> 02:22:04,660
which was therefore slipped on sideways
onto the hand. It's not a full ring. Um,

2381
02:22:04,760 --> 02:22:09,760
and a hole has been drilled through the
bracelet and from that whole it's been

2382
02:22:10,071 --> 02:22:14,150
possible to reconstruct that a pendant
was hung then the archeologists,

2383
02:22:14,360 --> 02:22:15,110
there it is.

2384
02:22:15,110 --> 02:22:20,000
Then the archaeologists started to take
a look in detail at the drill marks on

2385
02:22:20,001 --> 02:22:20,834
that hole.

2386
02:22:21,110 --> 02:22:25,590
And what they discovered
was a huge anomaly that that
was drilled with a stable

2387
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:30,340
fixed drill and it was drilled
at extremely high speed. It's a,

2388
02:22:30,420 --> 02:22:33,750
this is thought to be
40 or 50,000 years old.

2389
02:22:34,020 --> 02:22:37,800
There is not supposed to have been any
such technology in that period that was

2390
02:22:37,801 --> 02:22:40,380
capable of drilling with
a stable fixed to drill.

2391
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:44,280
And yet there it is there it appears.
So there,

2392
02:22:44,281 --> 02:22:48,630
there are also incredible,
very fine needles,

2393
02:22:48,690 --> 02:22:51,450
bone needles that the
Denisovans made very long ones,

2394
02:22:51,451 --> 02:22:54,240
which suggests that they were
stitching very heavy stuff together.

2395
02:22:54,241 --> 02:22:57,570
And the suggestion has been were
they making skin boats, for example,

2396
02:22:57,571 --> 02:23:00,990
to to use to navigate that would explain
how they managed to get themselves to

2397
02:23:00,991 --> 02:23:01,824
Australia,

2398
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:06,660
which is where the largest amount
of Denisovan DNA survives today.

2399
02:23:06,660 --> 02:23:07,493
There's one of those,

2400
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:12,150
there's one of those needles so that
there are indications of strangely out of

2401
02:23:12,151 --> 02:23:14,460
place technology amongst
the dentist servants,

2402
02:23:14,461 --> 02:23:17,370
which is 20 30,000 years
earlier in the human story.

2403
02:23:17,371 --> 02:23:20,580
Then it then it should be those kinds
of needles, that kind of bracelet.

2404
02:23:20,730 --> 02:23:23,730
You could expect to find them in what
archeologists call the Neolithic,

2405
02:23:23,910 --> 02:23:28,620
but to find it in the Paleolithic is very
puzzling and very odd and it suggests

2406
02:23:28,621 --> 02:23:33,621
that the Denisovans were certainly not
a sat shambling sub subhumans that they,

2407
02:23:33,721 --> 02:23:34,980
they were refined creatures.

2408
02:23:35,010 --> 02:23:37,710
Can you find out what year the
discover the Denisovans? Jamie,

2409
02:23:37,711 --> 02:23:38,700
can you Google that real quick?

2410
02:23:39,270 --> 02:23:42,220
I want to say it's in the two
thousands but I mean a ma,

2411
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:45,990
imagine that human beings have
been around for this long.

2412
02:23:46,170 --> 02:23:50,750
Here we are in 2019 and within the last
decade or so, they figured this out. Yeah.

2413
02:23:51,030 --> 02:23:53,490
We're discovering new
stuff about ourselves.

2414
02:23:53,490 --> 02:23:57,450
We're discovering that our story
is much richer, much more textured,

2415
02:23:57,840 --> 02:24:01,980
much more lead than we thought it was.
It's not a simple story.

2416
02:24:02,010 --> 02:24:04,020
It's a very complicated story.

2417
02:24:04,021 --> 02:24:08,070
And we ourselves are a hybrid species.
We are,

2418
02:24:08,071 --> 02:24:12,000
we are the result of interactions with
all kinds of different looking human

2419
02:24:12,001 --> 02:24:14,190
beings. And the end, the
end result is ourselves.

2420
02:24:14,191 --> 02:24:18,660
So it's not just that we carry
neanderthal or Denisovan DNA in a sense.

2421
02:24:18,661 --> 02:24:22,800
We are neanderthals and
Denisovans, uh, you know,

2422
02:24:22,801 --> 02:24:27,570
and have their, they are part of the
anatomically modern human human heritage.

2423
02:24:27,571 --> 02:24:29,700
So you make a good point.

2424
02:24:29,730 --> 02:24:33,210
The fact that this is only being
discovered now and that it's an incredibly

2425
02:24:33,211 --> 02:24:37,620
important, I mean, it, it completely
rewrite the story of our ancestry.

2426
02:24:37,860 --> 02:24:41,460
The notion,
the notion of 19 seven 1970s Oh,

2427
02:24:41,910 --> 02:24:45,570
the real work that's been done in Dennis
Server cave has been done in the two

2428
02:24:45,571 --> 02:24:47,970
thousands from,
from 2006,

2429
02:24:47,971 --> 02:24:52,971
2007 that's when the major papers have
been 2008 there had been published,

2430
02:24:53,940 --> 02:24:54,301
which have,

2431
02:24:54,301 --> 02:24:57,600
which have revealed the genome of the
dentist's servants and revealed the

2432
02:24:57,601 --> 02:25:00,720
dentist's over and connection to
two anatomically modern humans.

2433
02:25:01,050 --> 02:25:03,300
The fact that we're only
finding this out now that we,

2434
02:25:03,540 --> 02:25:07,620
that we told the story of our past and
weren't aware of this raises the question,

2435
02:25:07,621 --> 02:25:11,160
how much else in the story of our
past is there that we're not aware of?

2436
02:25:11,190 --> 02:25:13,890
Let's stop being so arrogant,
so sure of ourselves.

2437
02:25:13,891 --> 02:25:16,380
So confident in our findings
that's be more tentative.

2438
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:19,980
Let's keep an open mind and
see and see where it takes us.

2439
02:25:20,060 --> 02:25:24,130
That's the main message that I have
from, from all of this. And I think,

2440
02:25:24,680 --> 02:25:29,380
um, and I hope that this will be
an effect of this book. I'm not,

2441
02:25:29,500 --> 02:25:34,500
I'm not kidding myself that the
archeologists are going to jump on board,

2442
02:25:34,710 --> 02:25:36,070
uh,
overnight particularly.

2443
02:25:36,071 --> 02:25:41,071
So since I'm very critical of American
archeology in this book and I'm critical

2444
02:25:41,681 --> 02:25:46,681
of it specifically and explicitly because
of the dominance of the Clovis first

2445
02:25:47,320 --> 02:25:51,070
model for so long,
which prevented the research taking place.

2446
02:25:51,070 --> 02:25:56,070
And I have to say archaeologists like
to insult me by calling me a pseudo

2447
02:25:56,711 --> 02:25:57,550
scientist.

2448
02:25:58,690 --> 02:26:03,400
I can't think of anything
more pseudoscientific than
the Clovis first doctrine,

2449
02:26:03,460 --> 02:26:08,050
which locked American archeology for
50 years in a particular framework,

2450
02:26:08,051 --> 02:26:12,360
which we now know was totally wrong.
Nothing good about it at all. Uh,

2451
02:26:12,790 --> 02:26:14,050
a complete mistake.

2452
02:26:14,770 --> 02:26:19,770
What I'm hoping the book will do a in
the long run is that it will lead to more

2453
02:26:20,141 --> 02:26:22,540
attention being focused on the Americas.

2454
02:26:23,080 --> 02:26:26,510
This is a very neglected
area of the world. Uh,

2455
02:26:26,550 --> 02:26:29,860
as far as deep and ancient
archeology goes. Um, it's,

2456
02:26:30,130 --> 02:26:33,460
the recent history of the Americas
has been relatively well studied,

2457
02:26:33,461 --> 02:26:36,820
but the deep and ancient history has
not been, has not been well studied.

2458
02:26:37,240 --> 02:26:42,240
And I think America is going to contain
revelations for us about our story and

2459
02:26:43,931 --> 02:26:46,180
about our past.
And I'm serious when I,

2460
02:26:46,420 --> 02:26:51,420
when I suggest that America is the most
plausible and the most likely home base

2461
02:26:54,550 --> 02:26:58,900
for a lost civilization. If you're going
to propose a lost civilization, you need,

2462
02:26:58,930 --> 02:27:02,890
there are certain preconditions. You need
a, you can't have it on a small island.

2463
02:27:02,950 --> 02:27:06,460
There's got to be a large land mass with
enormous resources and the ability for

2464
02:27:06,461 --> 02:27:10,180
population to grow and for those
resources to be, to be mobilized.

2465
02:27:10,181 --> 02:27:12,670
And what I suddenly realized,
you asked earlier why I,

2466
02:27:12,730 --> 02:27:16,690
why I started to write this book at all
is what the new evidence is pointing to

2467
02:27:16,691 --> 02:27:19,120
is that the Americans have
been wrongly neglected.

2468
02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:24,360
That here we have a giant continental
land mass with extraordinary resources

2469
02:27:24,521 --> 02:27:27,940
that has just been ruled out of
the story of human civilization.

2470
02:27:27,941 --> 02:27:32,941
But once we take account of the fact that
there was a giant cataclysm over North

2471
02:27:33,311 --> 02:27:35,680
America 12,000,
800 years ago,

2472
02:27:35,681 --> 02:27:38,860
and once we start looking
as I do in America before,

2473
02:27:38,861 --> 02:27:43,810
at the incredible deep indepth
similarities between, for example,

2474
02:27:43,811 --> 02:27:47,620
the religious system of ancient
Egypt and the religious system of the

2475
02:27:47,621 --> 02:27:50,770
Mississippi Valley, then you
realize that you're into, uh,

2476
02:27:50,830 --> 02:27:52,450
into a global mystery here.

2477
02:27:52,480 --> 02:27:56,320
And that the answer to that mystery may
not at all be in the old world and may

2478
02:27:56,321 --> 02:28:00,190
very much be, uh, in the, in
the Americas. See, it's odd.

2479
02:28:00,191 --> 02:28:01,750
I mentioned Manville earlier on.

2480
02:28:02,500 --> 02:28:05,770
It's kind of odd that we should find a,

2481
02:28:05,771 --> 02:28:09,020
what is essentially the
ancient Egyptian religion, uh,

2482
02:28:09,160 --> 02:28:11,980
manifesting in the
symbolism of Mountville,

2483
02:28:12,040 --> 02:28:15,160
the ascent to Orion that
transit to the Milky Way,

2484
02:28:15,170 --> 02:28:16,660
the journey along the Milky Way.
Very,

2485
02:28:16,661 --> 02:28:20,650
these are very specific
and idiosyncratic ideas.

2486
02:28:20,651 --> 02:28:23,040
And what makes it doubly od is Manville,

2487
02:28:23,090 --> 02:28:27,170
isn't that old Manville as a site
is about a thousand years old.

2488
02:28:27,650 --> 02:28:32,650
Ancient Egypt had already been gone
completely from the world for at least 600

2489
02:28:33,981 --> 02:28:37,780
years before Manville was created.
The end of ancient Egypt. There's,

2490
02:28:37,790 --> 02:28:39,610
there's Mountville and uh,

2491
02:28:39,680 --> 02:28:43,850
w w what we're looking at in the
foreground is mount B and we're looking at

2492
02:28:43,851 --> 02:28:48,680
Monday and the in the, in
the distance, um, and, and a
complete circle of mountains.

2493
02:28:49,390 --> 02:28:54,290
What w what is odd about it is we find
the system of ancient Egyptian ideas in

2494
02:28:54,291 --> 02:28:58,640
Moundsville 500 years after ancient Egypt
has gone from the world. The Romans,

2495
02:28:58,670 --> 02:29:03,650
the Romans were the end of ancient Egypt
by 400 Aad, ancient Egypt has gone.

2496
02:29:03,740 --> 02:29:05,660
Manville doesn't even exist then,

2497
02:29:05,900 --> 02:29:10,900
but 600 years later it is created and
it manifests the entire set of ancient

2498
02:29:11,841 --> 02:29:12,680
Egyptian ideas.

2499
02:29:12,681 --> 02:29:16,100
Clearly it did not get that as a result
of direct transmission from ancient

2500
02:29:16,101 --> 02:29:17,660
Egypt unless they were time travelers.

2501
02:29:18,020 --> 02:29:22,220
The only way I think it could have got
it is as a result of a legacy passed down

2502
02:29:22,221 --> 02:29:26,930
from a much earlier civilization that has
influenced and affected many different

2503
02:29:26,931 --> 02:29:30,300
parts of the world and the
characteristics of that civilization,

2504
02:29:30,530 --> 02:29:34,550
the shamanistic heart of it, the use
of altered states of consciousness.

2505
02:29:34,551 --> 02:29:38,870
The focus on those are amongst the reasons
that I would suggest that America is

2506
02:29:38,871 --> 02:29:43,460
the place that we should be looking and
the big mysteries are in the areas that

2507
02:29:43,461 --> 02:29:47,030
were so devastated at the end of the
last ice age up in the north of North

2508
02:29:47,031 --> 02:29:51,890
America, the channel scab
lands in particular, and
then the Mississippi Valley,

2509
02:29:51,891 --> 02:29:55,430
the whole story of the Mississippi Valley.
Yes, Manville is a thousand years old,

2510
02:29:55,640 --> 02:29:59,630
but then you can go back to
poverty point in Louisiana,

2511
02:29:59,870 --> 02:30:02,240
which is 2,700 years old.

2512
02:30:02,420 --> 02:30:06,980
You can go to Watson break in Louisiana,
which is 5,500 years old.

2513
02:30:06,981 --> 02:30:10,370
You can go to sites like Conley,
which are 8,000 years old.

2514
02:30:10,550 --> 02:30:14,840
The system keeps on going back
and disappearing back into time.

2515
02:30:14,841 --> 02:30:19,760
And I think the most fruitful new work
on exploring the origins of civilization

2516
02:30:19,761 --> 02:30:23,600
is going to occur counter
intuitively in the Americas.

2517
02:30:23,601 --> 02:30:27,710
The very last place on earth
that archeologists have
ever thought to look where

2518
02:30:27,711 --> 02:30:30,870
to what to mainstream, uh, archeologists,

2519
02:30:30,880 --> 02:30:35,240
what do they think caused those drill
marks? And then Dennis over and bracelets,

2520
02:30:35,360 --> 02:30:37,820
if not really explained
it. Um, the, the Russian,

2521
02:30:38,030 --> 02:30:41,970
the Russian archeologist who published
the report on that, uh, are them,

2522
02:30:42,050 --> 02:30:45,950
are themselves mystified by it and they
realize that it's dynamite. It's an,

2523
02:30:45,951 --> 02:30:50,270
it's an explosive discovery. Uh, it's
a, it's an out of place technology.

2524
02:30:50,600 --> 02:30:54,110
And so they're trying to explain
how come fixed stable drilling,

2525
02:30:54,350 --> 02:30:57,710
which we thought was
introduced first in the,

2526
02:30:57,711 --> 02:31:00,800
in the Neolithic maybe seven,
8,000 years ago.

2527
02:31:00,801 --> 02:31:04,700
How come that is now found in a
site that's 40 or 50,000 years old?

2528
02:31:04,860 --> 02:31:07,250
And so all those bracelets,
oh yeah, absolutely.

2529
02:31:07,251 --> 02:31:10,970
Those bracelets or 40,000 at the May, they
may have been older. There's, there's,

2530
02:31:11,030 --> 02:31:14,930
there's recent research
suggests suggesting that
they may go back 65 to 70,000

2531
02:31:14,931 --> 02:31:18,110
years,
the extremely ancient and therefore,

2532
02:31:18,290 --> 02:31:22,860
and therefore they're an out-of-place
technology which doesn't fit with the

2533
02:31:22,861 --> 02:31:26,700
timeline of history that we've been out
of place. It was very, very out of place.

2534
02:31:26,730 --> 02:31:29,790
Very, very, very odd
feature that we have here.

2535
02:31:29,791 --> 02:31:33,270
So what this says to me
is that we as a species,

2536
02:31:33,330 --> 02:31:37,260
and I've this,
I guess this is kind of my pet phrase,

2537
02:31:37,261 --> 02:31:42,261
we are a species with Amnesia
is my favorite phrase of
we have forgotten so much

2538
02:31:42,331 --> 02:31:44,730
more about ourselves than we remember.

2539
02:31:44,820 --> 02:31:48,480
And what the process of history and
archeology should really be about is a

2540
02:31:48,481 --> 02:31:50,280
process of remembering.

2541
02:31:50,520 --> 02:31:55,320
We shouldn't be imposing our ideas of
what we should have been on the past.

2542
02:31:55,350 --> 02:31:59,460
We should allow the past to
speak for itself when it does.

2543
02:31:59,461 --> 02:32:03,420
So it speaks eloquently.
Um,

2544
02:32:03,450 --> 02:32:08,450
one of the sites that we visited and
explored for America before was sip ant

2545
02:32:10,411 --> 02:32:14,190
mound in Ohio. I don't know if
you've ever been there. You know,

2546
02:32:14,191 --> 02:32:18,570
I've heard of it though. It is an amazing,
Jamie is from Ohio. Your Beta. Yeah.

2547
02:32:18,571 --> 02:32:21,330
Jamie and I were talking about it
earlier. There's seven man, there's a,

2548
02:32:21,331 --> 02:32:26,331
there's an aerial view of that is Correy.

2549
02:32:27,360 --> 02:32:31,290
Here's the thing. You see that beautiful.
You see the head end of separate man.

2550
02:32:31,291 --> 02:32:35,430
They're so Santa and I went there
at the summer solstice in uh,

2551
02:32:35,550 --> 02:32:39,420
2017.
We were there on June 21st,

2552
02:32:39,420 --> 02:32:43,710
2017 and my wife Santha is a photographer
and we acquired a drone for this

2553
02:32:43,711 --> 02:32:48,480
specific purpose and she flew the drone
up 400 feet above separate mount and we

2554
02:32:48,481 --> 02:32:50,790
sat it up there watching the sunset.

2555
02:32:51,060 --> 02:32:53,550
And what happens on the summer solstice,

2556
02:32:53,551 --> 02:32:55,840
and you can only see it
perfectly with adrenaline there.

2557
02:32:55,860 --> 02:32:58,190
There's pictures of it in
the, in the book here. Uh,

2558
02:32:58,200 --> 02:33:01,860
what happens on the summer solstice,
you can see it from ground level,

2559
02:33:01,861 --> 02:33:04,170
but you get up 400 feet,
you really get it.

2560
02:33:04,440 --> 02:33:09,120
The head of that serpent is pointing
directly at a niche in the distant hills

2561
02:33:09,330 --> 02:33:14,250
through which the sun sets on the summer
solstice on the longest day of the year.

2562
02:33:14,280 --> 02:33:18,900
So it's a, it's a sky ground
alignment perfection that is,

2563
02:33:18,930 --> 02:33:22,470
that is taking place there. It's a
beautiful, it's a beautiful thing to see,

2564
02:33:22,471 --> 02:33:26,880
to watch that sun majestically sinking
down into the horizon and see this

2565
02:33:27,300 --> 02:33:29,610
awesome figure of the
serpent gazing directly.

2566
02:33:29,630 --> 02:33:32,790
I've attic with its jaws open
almost as though it's about to,

2567
02:33:33,120 --> 02:33:34,620
about to swallow the sun.

2568
02:33:35,010 --> 02:33:40,010
And then we remember that there are other
sites around the world which are also

2569
02:33:40,471 --> 02:33:45,420
aligned to key moments of the, of the
solar year aligned to the winter solstice.

2570
02:33:45,420 --> 02:33:47,940
For example,
the Temple of Karnak in Upper Egypt.

2571
02:33:47,941 --> 02:33:52,941
That kilometer long access targets
exactly the rising point of the sun on the

2572
02:33:54,150 --> 02:33:58,050
winter solstice. One of the
interesting things about serpent mound,

2573
02:33:59,100 --> 02:34:03,240
and I urge anybody listening to this go
visit serpent mound and especially go

2574
02:34:03,241 --> 02:34:05,580
there on the summer solstice
cause that's the moment.

2575
02:34:05,581 --> 02:34:09,460
That's the marriage of heaven and earth.
That's when Skyann ground unite in,

2576
02:34:09,461 --> 02:34:13,830
in Majesty at, uh, at,
at, at that place. Um,

2577
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:18,070
but one of the mysteries
of serpent mound concerns,

2578
02:34:18,310 --> 02:34:22,840
how old is this mound? Really?
How, how, how far back does it go?

2579
02:34:23,140 --> 02:34:25,720
And there have been arguments that uh,

2580
02:34:25,770 --> 02:34:29,140
that there's a group of archeologists
who would like it to be just a thousand

2581
02:34:29,141 --> 02:34:32,410
years old and they attributed
it to a culture of called
the fort ancient culture.

2582
02:34:32,740 --> 02:34:36,160
There's another group of archeologists
in my view who have done much more

2583
02:34:36,161 --> 02:34:39,850
thorough, thorough work who
attributed to the Edina culture.

2584
02:34:40,300 --> 02:34:43,810
The thing about which goes
back to 2,300 years ago or so,

2585
02:34:43,811 --> 02:34:46,330
there's evidence for an earlier
construction enterprise.

2586
02:34:46,331 --> 02:34:51,331
It looks like the site has
been continuously reconstructed
and remodeled as we

2587
02:34:52,121 --> 02:34:54,550
would do with any sacred site.
If it begins to wear down,

2588
02:34:54,551 --> 02:34:58,930
you remodel it and then you get later
organic material being introduced to the

2589
02:34:58,931 --> 02:35:02,290
site. That may give you the impression
that the site is only that old.

2590
02:35:02,650 --> 02:35:07,510
What's intriguing about serpent mound
is it stands on a natural ridge and that

2591
02:35:07,511 --> 02:35:12,130
natural ridge, and this is entirely
an accident of heaven and earth,

2592
02:35:12,400 --> 02:35:14,980
that Natural Ridge, the
head end of it, if you like,

2593
02:35:15,010 --> 02:35:18,520
is naturally oriented to
the summer solstice sunset.

2594
02:35:19,630 --> 02:35:24,630
Somebody a long time ago noticed that
natural orientation and they decided to

2595
02:35:25,211 --> 02:35:26,260
monumentalize it.

2596
02:35:26,261 --> 02:35:31,261
Here was a place where earth whispered
to sky the earth in her own nature,

2597
02:35:32,470 --> 02:35:36,940
looked directly at the place on the
horizon where the sun was setting.

2598
02:35:37,150 --> 02:35:40,150
This was a highly significant place.
This place mattered.

2599
02:35:40,360 --> 02:35:44,770
So they then created serpent mound
on top of it. They memorialized it.

2600
02:35:45,010 --> 02:35:46,090
They turned it into a,

2601
02:35:46,360 --> 02:35:51,360
into a special special place that human
beings had had a hand in making to honor

2602
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:53,260
the marriage of heaven and earth.

2603
02:35:53,890 --> 02:35:58,270
And what I found researching this book
is that serpent mound is not alone in

2604
02:35:58,271 --> 02:35:59,104
that respect.

2605
02:35:59,520 --> 02:36:03,610
A lot of people are puzzled
by Stonehenge in England.

2606
02:36:04,030 --> 02:36:09,030
A stone Henge is built on Salisbury
plain and there are two kinds of big

2607
02:36:09,761 --> 02:36:11,110
megaliths that Stonehenge,

2608
02:36:11,140 --> 02:36:15,470
one of them are called sostenes and
the other called the bluestones.

2609
02:36:15,540 --> 02:36:18,280
The blue stones,
we know for sure were brought along way.

2610
02:36:18,281 --> 02:36:21,850
They were brought from Wales to
Stonehenge, a distance of about 150 miles.

2611
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:27,360
The sarsens are found in abundance
on a place called the mob downs,

2612
02:36:28,030 --> 02:36:30,430
which is about 20 miles from Stonehenge.

2613
02:36:30,700 --> 02:36:34,600
But until very recently it was thought
there were no sauces on Salisbury plain

2614
02:36:34,601 --> 02:36:35,434
at all.

2615
02:36:35,440 --> 02:36:40,440
An archeologist couldn't understand why
Stonehenge wasn't built on the Marlboro

2616
02:36:40,580 --> 02:36:42,910
downs weather,
whether it's big Saas and stones,

2617
02:36:42,911 --> 02:36:46,690
the 20 to 30 10 megaliths where available
locally and didn't have to be brought

2618
02:36:46,691 --> 02:36:48,520
there.
Very recent research,

2619
02:36:48,521 --> 02:36:53,521
2018 research has provided the answer
that two of those sauces were naturally in

2620
02:36:53,651 --> 02:36:56,290
position all the time at at Stonehenge.

2621
02:36:56,320 --> 02:36:59,560
And they are sauce and
stone 16 and the heel stone.

2622
02:36:59,860 --> 02:37:04,600
And if you stand behind and stone 16
and look at the Hillstone at dawn on the

2623
02:37:04,601 --> 02:37:09,130
summer solstice you see the sun rising
in direct alignment with the view and the

2624
02:37:09,131 --> 02:37:13,630
heel stone is like the site on the
barrel of a rifle targeting the sun.

2625
02:37:13,800 --> 02:37:17,480
And that was there naturally
it was speaking to sky.

2626
02:37:17,720 --> 02:37:20,690
The ancient saw that they
decided this was sacred.

2627
02:37:20,960 --> 02:37:24,120
They went to huge lengths
to bring the sauces,

2628
02:37:24,150 --> 02:37:27,620
the rest of the Sarsens from the mob
redounds to create the big stone circle at

2629
02:37:27,621 --> 02:37:30,260
Stonehenge and meant to put
the blue stones inside it.

2630
02:37:30,261 --> 02:37:35,261
But initially what they were celebrating
was a natural union of Heaven and

2631
02:37:35,391 --> 02:37:38,210
earth. And that brings us
to the notion of as above.

2632
02:37:38,420 --> 02:37:42,140
So below that we are connected
to the cosmos. That it is,

2633
02:37:42,290 --> 02:37:46,850
that it is part of our heritage. We in
modern cities, forget the cosmos exists.

2634
02:37:47,030 --> 02:37:51,830
We have all kinds of tech that can look
at astronomy, astronomy programs, we can,

2635
02:37:51,831 --> 02:37:52,341
we'd all do that.

2636
02:37:52,341 --> 02:37:55,640
But actually looking at the stars is
something that's very difficult for people

2637
02:37:55,641 --> 02:37:59,510
who live in cities to do where
we're cut off from the cosmos,

2638
02:37:59,511 --> 02:38:01,520
we're cut off from the
notion that it is sacred,

2639
02:38:01,820 --> 02:38:04,240
that it matters to the human creature.
And what,

2640
02:38:04,241 --> 02:38:08,180
what the ancient seem to have had done
is to realize how vital that connection

2641
02:38:08,181 --> 02:38:13,181
is and to memorialize it and to celebrate
it and to draw our attention to the

2642
02:38:14,300 --> 02:38:17,330
intimate connection between ground Scott.
Yeah.

2643
02:38:17,331 --> 02:38:21,710
Light pollution sort of fuels our infant
tile existence and a lot of ways, right?

2644
02:38:21,711 --> 02:38:25,040
Because it doesn't constantly remind us
that we're a part of this great thing.

2645
02:38:25,370 --> 02:38:29,270
Yeah. Light, light, light, light pollution
is, uh, is, is, is a huge factor.

2646
02:38:29,271 --> 02:38:33,200
It's very easy to forget that we live
in a universe. Very easy to forget that.

2647
02:38:33,230 --> 02:38:34,020
Very easy to,

2648
02:38:34,020 --> 02:38:36,890
to believe that it's just about
these cities that we live in and the,

2649
02:38:36,891 --> 02:38:39,950
and the intimate concerns of our,
of our daily lives.

2650
02:38:39,951 --> 02:38:44,750
But when in fact we're part of
something much, much bigger. And my God,

2651
02:38:44,751 --> 02:38:45,400
I mean,
it's,

2652
02:38:45,400 --> 02:38:50,400
it's a mystery enough to be
born a human being at all.

2653
02:38:50,450 --> 02:38:54,460
Yes. You know, just to be
alive is a, is, is, is,

2654
02:38:54,530 --> 02:38:56,570
is an extraordinary mystery.
Yes.

2655
02:38:56,600 --> 02:39:00,980
To have the ability to love, uh, to, to,

2656
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:06,140
to feel emotions, um, to
understand beauty, to be moved by,

2657
02:39:06,390 --> 02:39:10,610
by, by a symphony. All of all of
these things we take for granted,

2658
02:39:10,670 --> 02:39:12,890
but actually they're deeply mysterious.

2659
02:39:12,891 --> 02:39:17,891
We don't really know what we are or who
we are and which is one of the reasons

2660
02:39:19,820 --> 02:39:23,750
I'm so fascinated by, uh,
Rick Strassman's work. You,

2661
02:39:23,810 --> 02:39:26,960
you presented his film,
Dmt, the spirit molecule,

2662
02:39:26,961 --> 02:39:31,510
and on my upcoming speaking to her, I'm
going to be doing an event with Rick, uh,

2663
02:39:31,550 --> 02:39:34,760
on the 14th or 15th of May in Sedona.

2664
02:39:34,761 --> 02:39:37,990
I think it will be the first time that
Rick has spoken publicly for quite a

2665
02:39:37,991 --> 02:39:41,630
while. Rick has a colleague
called Andrew Gallimore, uh,

2666
02:39:41,631 --> 02:39:44,070
who teaches at the
University of La Kinawa, uh,

2667
02:39:44,090 --> 02:39:48,760
in Japan and Rick and Andrew have
together developed a technology,

2668
02:39:48,990 --> 02:39:49,430
uh,

2669
02:39:49,430 --> 02:39:54,430
for releasing DMT into human volunteers
in a very slow drip that will keep them

2670
02:39:54,981 --> 02:39:58,700
in the DMT state if they
wish for hours on end.

2671
02:40:00,080 --> 02:40:01,910
And the intention,

2672
02:40:02,120 --> 02:40:07,120
the intention is to use this technology
to explore and map the DMT realm.

2673
02:40:09,080 --> 02:40:12,410
When do I sign up? Soon as possible.
Where do I, it's it's very close.

2674
02:40:12,411 --> 02:40:13,290
Imperial College.

2675
02:40:13,320 --> 02:40:17,970
It looks like Imperial College London
is going to deploy this technology in

2676
02:40:17,971 --> 02:40:22,971
further research into DMT and that that
research is not going to be purely and

2677
02:40:23,551 --> 02:40:27,300
simply into the therapeutic
potential of a psychedelic,

2678
02:40:27,301 --> 02:40:29,040
which is very important research to do.

2679
02:40:29,190 --> 02:40:33,570
It's going to be an investigation into
the nature of reality using a psychedelic,

2680
02:40:33,571 --> 02:40:36,330
the mysterious nature of reality.
And it is art.

2681
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:40,050
And you know this from personal experience
that when you get plunged into that

2682
02:40:40,051 --> 02:40:40,980
DMT realm,

2683
02:40:41,220 --> 02:40:45,440
it is so different from the realm
of our daily daily world filled,

2684
02:40:45,441 --> 02:40:46,410
filled with geometry,

2685
02:40:46,411 --> 02:40:51,390
filled with these sprightly intelligences
completely internally coherent.

2686
02:40:51,510 --> 02:40:56,510
How can that be generated by the brain
or are are we dealing with some other

2687
02:40:56,761 --> 02:40:58,860
level of reality that we
haven't encountered yet?

2688
02:40:59,010 --> 02:41:04,010
I think that ancient cultures
and in particular my lost
civilization were deeply

2689
02:41:05,251 --> 02:41:08,770
involved in exploring the
mysterious nature of reality, um,

2690
02:41:08,820 --> 02:41:12,240
and used the plant medicines
as part of that process.

2691
02:41:12,300 --> 02:41:16,200
When it comes to the serpent mound where
the head points in the summer solstice

2692
02:41:16,201 --> 02:41:19,420
is that take into account the procession
of the equinoxes in terms of the

2693
02:41:19,700 --> 02:41:23,340
position of the summer solstice sun
on the horizon is not effected by the

2694
02:41:23,341 --> 02:41:26,550
procession,
however it is affected by another,

2695
02:41:26,610 --> 02:41:30,090
another factor which is a slight
nod on the axis of the earth,

2696
02:41:30,660 --> 02:41:35,400
a nod but not a wobble, not a
wobble and a nod and, and a,

2697
02:41:35,401 --> 02:41:37,470
it's called a mutation and the,

2698
02:41:37,500 --> 02:41:42,480
the access of the earth
nods back and forward over a
cycle of about 41,000 years.

2699
02:41:42,750 --> 02:41:43,800
And that can,

2700
02:41:44,070 --> 02:41:49,070
that does adjust the position of sunrise
on the horizon over a very long period

2701
02:41:50,401 --> 02:41:55,320
of time. And it would, in theory, if
this idea can be taken seriously enough,

2702
02:41:55,350 --> 02:41:59,910
it would in theory be possible to use
very precise observations using the latest

2703
02:41:59,911 --> 02:42:00,690
modern tech,

2704
02:42:00,690 --> 02:42:04,830
not simply being up there in a drone and
seeing the general connection between

2705
02:42:04,831 --> 02:42:07,260
the position of the sun on the
horizon and the head of serpent.

2706
02:42:07,320 --> 02:42:12,270
Marty would be possible to refine that
and actually say astronomically the

2707
02:42:12,271 --> 02:42:16,140
precise date on which serpent mound must
have been first created to precisely

2708
02:42:16,141 --> 02:42:20,460
target the rising sun on the
equinox. Wow. On that note,

2709
02:42:20,461 --> 02:42:24,000
which did three hours did we buy?
I would,

2710
02:42:24,030 --> 02:42:27,180
I would ask your listeners and viewers
while we're talking about Ohio,

2711
02:42:27,390 --> 02:42:30,480
don't forget about Newark and high bank.

2712
02:42:30,990 --> 02:42:35,370
These are two incredible,
amazing, absolutely stunning,

2713
02:42:35,371 --> 02:42:38,580
gorgeous geometrical sites.
It's sad,

2714
02:42:38,581 --> 02:42:43,380
but one of them is preserved within a
private golf course. Oh, no. However,

2715
02:42:43,410 --> 02:42:47,220
it's not so sad because if it hadn't been
preserved within a private golf course,

2716
02:42:47,250 --> 02:42:49,020
it would be gone completely.

2717
02:42:49,140 --> 02:42:53,160
More than 90% of the native
American earthworks that
were documented in the 19th

2718
02:42:53,161 --> 02:42:56,250
century are gone now.
They'd been plowed under for agriculture.

2719
02:42:56,251 --> 02:43:00,680
That's another part of our missing
story there. We're looking at Newark,

2720
02:43:00,770 --> 02:43:05,490
see that octagon and circle combination
that's repeated at another site called

2721
02:43:05,491 --> 02:43:07,410
high bank,
which is 60 miles away.

2722
02:43:07,590 --> 02:43:11,410
And the octagon circling gimme
a gimme a large image that,

2723
02:43:11,430 --> 02:43:14,750
so an overlay or is that
what it actually looks for?

2724
02:43:14,760 --> 02:43:17,740
It actually looks like
that's, I mean that's, that's,
that's a graphic based on it.

2725
02:43:17,770 --> 02:43:21,070
Well the octagon circle combination
in the top left of the image are best

2726
02:43:21,071 --> 02:43:23,590
preserved.
The other bits are not so well preserved.

2727
02:43:23,800 --> 02:43:26,710
And the reason the octagon circle our
best preserved is cause they're in a

2728
02:43:26,711 --> 02:43:30,580
private golf club where otherwise
they would have been plowed under.

2729
02:43:30,760 --> 02:43:34,960
The interesting thing is that that octagon
circle combination is 60 miles from

2730
02:43:34,961 --> 02:43:35,794
high bank,

2731
02:43:35,920 --> 02:43:39,640
but there's another octagon circle
combination there and it is oriented that

2732
02:43:39,641 --> 02:43:41,560
precisely 90 degrees to that one.

2733
02:43:41,830 --> 02:43:45,760
That speaks of high science in the
Mississippi Valley are very, very,

2734
02:43:45,761 --> 02:43:47,470
very long time ago.

2735
02:43:47,620 --> 02:43:51,730
There's so much to explore and so much
to investigate and so much to inquire

2736
02:43:51,731 --> 02:43:53,140
into an America.
Uh,

2737
02:43:53,230 --> 02:43:56,860
it's just an incredible land and its
mysteries have been hidden from us.

2738
02:43:56,861 --> 02:44:01,861
And I'm hoping with this book that I have
managed to pull the veil back a little

2739
02:44:03,131 --> 02:44:05,920
bit on those mysteries, and if we really
coming to the end of earth, he said,

2740
02:44:05,921 --> 02:44:08,500
really three hours. Oh my God. If we,

2741
02:44:08,860 --> 02:44:11,560
if we're really coming to the end
of our three hours, can I repeat?

2742
02:44:11,590 --> 02:44:14,650
I would love to see readers
of my books at my events.

2743
02:44:14,680 --> 02:44:18,400
I'm doing three events in
Canada, Vancouver, Montreal,

2744
02:44:18,910 --> 02:44:23,890
and Toronto, and I'm doing something like
17 or 18 events in the United States.

2745
02:44:23,891 --> 02:44:25,870
I'm just speaking continuously,
uh,

2746
02:44:26,020 --> 02:44:29,860
right the way across the u s I wish I
could visit every state in the u s but my

2747
02:44:29,861 --> 02:44:31,900
goodness,
this is an enormous country.

2748
02:44:32,260 --> 02:44:36,400
Every state in the U s is as big as
the entire British isles, you know? Uh,

2749
02:44:36,401 --> 02:44:38,140
but I'm in visiting as many as I am.

2750
02:44:38,140 --> 02:44:40,420
I'm going to be giving
illustrated presentations.

2751
02:44:40,450 --> 02:44:42,640
I'll be signing books afterwards.
I'll be taking pictures.

2752
02:44:42,850 --> 02:44:46,420
I would like to meet my readers
and please check out my website,

2753
02:44:46,421 --> 02:44:48,760
Graham hancock.com look at
the talks and events page,

2754
02:44:48,761 --> 02:44:52,360
and you'll see where all these events
are occurring over the next seven weeks.

2755
02:44:52,361 --> 02:44:53,980
We're on the 22nd of April today.

2756
02:44:54,220 --> 02:44:57,430
I will not leave North American
until the 5th of June. Oh, wow.

2757
02:44:57,431 --> 02:45:00,520
I hope I see you again then
in, listen, thank you so much.

2758
02:45:00,521 --> 02:45:02,150
You're a treasure and this book is,

2759
02:45:02,200 --> 02:45:06,010
I can't wait to get into it America
before and the audio book is available now

2760
02:45:06,011 --> 02:45:09,730
as well. Yeah, the audio books available.
I read it. Thank you so much, Graham.

2761
02:45:09,731 --> 02:45:12,340
It's always a pleasure having you here.
I'm really, really appreciate you.

2762
02:45:12,370 --> 02:45:16,030
Thanks for having me back on, Joe Graham
Hancock, ladies and gentlemen. Bye.

2763
02:45:24,440 --> 02:45:24,520
Okay.
