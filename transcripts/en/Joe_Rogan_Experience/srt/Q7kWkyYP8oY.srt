1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,090
Go to the Jersey shore.

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,423
Three,
two.

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:10,751
Great.
Tom,

4
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:13,480
Papa will be at the Jersey shore this
weekend.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,690
Do you ever get do gigs?
Downloading flip flops.

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,090
Had a metal detector.
Do you know anybody's ever scored with a

7
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:23,520
metal detector?
No,

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,640
I mean scored like,
found like a bottle cap.

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,560
Civil war belt buckle or some shit and
never,

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,360
never.
I used,

11
00:00:31,361 --> 00:00:34,180
I had one when I was a kid.
I used to go to the Jersey shore.

12
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:36,150
It was orange and I would get

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,073
sure

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,160
and no heat,
no air?

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,250
No a earphones or anything.
I would just walk out on the beach with

16
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,390
it.
Never found anything.

17
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,100
What's the earphones?
Did they tell you?

18
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:49,610
Like when the frequency is different?
Does that sound?

19
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,040
Yeah.
You just go and it's just like the

20
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,630
frequency of the beeps?
Yeah,

21
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,130
it's like hot hotter,
hotter,

22
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:56,240
hotter,
hotter and hotter.

23
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:57,680
Burning hot.
You're there.

24
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,590
How do those things work?
I have never looked into metal

25
00:01:00,591 --> 00:01:01,910
detectors.
I don't know.

26
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,940
But you know like if you take that to
like the Appalachian trail or like you

27
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:11,060
know where the civil war went down and
that kind of stuff like that.

28
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,290
You'd find stuff.
Oh,

29
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,450
I guarantee Ya.
Yeah.

30
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,180
I guarantee you see what is the most
sophisticated current.

31
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,293
Oh,
I just.

32
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,690
I just looked this up just a couple of
weeks ago.

33
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,870
$2,000,000 worth of Viking Golden.
God.

34
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,450
Oh,
who's laughing now?

35
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,980
It's 2 million pounds.

36
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,500
What does that 4 million.
It's 20 bucks.

37
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,190
Is that $4 million?
A double.

38
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,020
It's like do I at least one and a half
to two times?

39
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:36,380
Yes.
I'm like,

40
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,520
Jesus Christ Viking treasure hoard.
What does he got in that photo?

41
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:41,890
That's what it looks like.
Oh,

42
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:45,750
that's his metal detector.
You looked at metal detector to.

43
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,660
Looks like assault duct taped together
and shit.

44
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,470
It's like he's been using it a long time
and this dude found millions of dollars

45
00:01:51,471 --> 00:01:53,840
in viking fines.
That's pretty great.

46
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,160
I found nothing.
I found like a bottle cap and it's

47
00:01:58,161 --> 00:02:00,950
exciting when you hear.
It's like dee dee dee dee dee dee lived

48
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,200
it all this shitty found.
Look at that vase.

49
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,490
Look at that ring.
That's cool.

50
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,400
That's like the hobbit ring.
Wow.

51
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,700
Tenth Century Gold Ring.
Oh my God.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Is that cool?
That was one 10th century Golden Rain.

53
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,800
It's pretty great and he wore that.
You guys got to walk in the right

54
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:22,250
places.

55
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,810
I'm in the Jersey shore,
you know what I mean?

56
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,480
There wasn't.
My Dad lives in Florida on the treasure

57
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:27,231
coast,
they call it,

58
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:30,360
which is like the Atlantic,
Mid Atlantic or mid halfway up and down

59
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:32,300
in Florida.
So like every time it's hurricanes too.

60
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:35,000
People are always out on the beach
looking for stuff because shit gets

61
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,820
to treasure.
Chests are train wrecks,

62
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,750
like in the Bermuda Triangle.
So I like the pirate treasure gets wiped

63
00:02:41,751 --> 00:02:44,630
up onto the beach.
There's something about finding that

64
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,760
the,
like if you went to a museum and you saw

65
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:50,090
a ring from the ninth century,
the 10th century,

66
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:51,620
whatever it is,
you'd probably be like,

67
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:53,360
wow,
that's incredible.

68
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:54,194
That's right.
That's right.

69
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,250
But if you fucking founded in the dirt
and you picked it up and it may be

70
00:02:58,251 --> 00:02:59,540
likely,
I mean there's,

71
00:02:59,620 --> 00:02:59,980
there's at

72
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,320
least a possibility.
The last person that touched it was the

73
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:04,060
person that died there.
Huge,

74
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,030
huge possibility.
Huge.

75
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:06,960
I mean,
that's.

76
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,450
I mean,
how great would that.

77
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,760
The feeling would have been amazing fun.
Find a fossil.

78
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,960
You ever find a fossil when you were a
kid walking around?

79
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,940
Not really a felon.
Arrowhead though.

80
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,510
That's important to you.
Excited is.

81
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,490
It was in Nevada.
Bowhunting.

82
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,940
I found an arrowhead and I lost it.
Oh,

83
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,570
that's terrible.
Think you're actually supposed to leave

84
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,970
them there.
So it's probably Karma for them.

85
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:32,830
Like leaving here.
This is a trail.

86
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,880
Anyways,
gonna find it.

87
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,000
This is stupid.
Like if you want me to bring it to me,

88
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:37,420
his hair or something,
that's one thing.

89
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,430
But just say,
just leave it there for.

90
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,380
Yeah,
someone else is going to become taken.

91
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,710
No one's going to leave it there.

92
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,260
Story of my brother in law who uses
metal detector and his,

93
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,670
his uh,
friends married couple I think newly

94
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:58,000
married when hiking in the grand tetons
and she lost her ring.

95
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:03,180
She lost her engagement ring and uh,
he was going out there like in a month

96
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:08,110
from then and he went out and he took
his metal detector here and he hiked

97
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:12,610
along the same trail and he comes back
to New Jersey and his buddies in the bar

98
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:15,430
and he just sits down next to him at the
bar and touches the ring on the,

99
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,700
on the bar.

100
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,150
Holy Shit.
I found it wholly shaking.

101
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,470
Yeah.
Wow.

102
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:24,680
What are the odds of all the steps she
could have taken?

103
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,940
Yeah.
The places she could have gone.

104
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:29,960
I mean they probably told her what trail
that he took or whatever.

105
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,970
Just the whole trail.
Yeah,

106
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,240
exactly.
Someone telling you I lost my wedding

107
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:37,130
ring on this trip somewhere.
Go find it.

108
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,140
What the fuck are you talking about?
Greg?

109
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,660
On the great move is not calling and
saying,

110
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:42,620
Holy Shit.
I found it.

111
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,130
Just showing up at your local bar and
think that's pretty gangster.

112
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,030
Yeah,
it's pretty bad,

113
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:49,790
but it's like the state of the art
consumer model,

114
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,190
metal detector.
Maybe I should have a metal detector.

115
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,630
Dude,
come on here and talk to me and go,

116
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,210
what the fuck they do.
That would be cool because I guess it's

117
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,770
gotta be exciting.
Right?

118
00:04:57,771 --> 00:04:59,450
Especially like places like the beach.

119
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,040
We're stuff washes up.
Yeah.

120
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,750
Do you have to wear sandals when you do
it?

121
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,100
You have must.
Right?

122
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:08,290
But you must have a certain body odor to
like have like a mill do.

123
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,350
Dewy,
bittery.

124
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,510
Sort of a salary.
Milky smelled like a little like ham.

125
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,280
The Garrett.
Is this supposed to be the shit?

126
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,470
Oh yeah.
Look how popped up.

127
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:20,000
Pretty high.
That goes on your forearm,

128
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:20,834
right?
That weight.

129
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,000
So for 340 bucks you could find out the
back of your 2 million pounds worth of

130
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:28,880
Viking stuff.
Look at that thing and it's cheap.

131
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,010
Is that the best one?
See if there's some sensitivity.

132
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,840
Lack of a metal detector role model.
Who was the way it comes to the

133
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,601
waterproof?
Well,

134
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:41,410
ever since I went pro comes with a lot
of stuff's changed.

135
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,640
Golden Sixty four.
Jesus Christ.

136
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,640
Oh you went pro.
I went pro,

137
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,710
you know,
uh,

138
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,530
after the Viking gold thing,
right?

139
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,810
Like obviously I'm blessed.
So uh,

140
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,160
oh totally,
totally.

141
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:53,900
But what does that mean to you?
You have a sponsor,

142
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,490
yo bro.
Oh Man.

143
00:05:55,491 --> 00:05:58,220
Make money off of a finding a river.

144
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,020
You take it underwater.
Whoa,

145
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:02,510
that's deep.
That's actually pretty bad ass.

146
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,920
You know what though?
It's not all that bad ass.

147
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,300
There's something about,
there's something Corny,

148
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,700
like even even the best ones,
it's still like,

149
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,670
it's definitely like it's in the fanny
pack realm.

150
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,480
Yeah,
I endorsed,

151
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:18,260
but it's like,
what?

152
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,140
What are you doing here?
Exactly where you're given up by this

153
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:22,810
one,
$799.

154
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,630
Eight thousand thousand,
8,000 extra night in there.

155
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,620
Go.
There you go.

156
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,990
Gold Nugget.
Metal detector.

157
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,850
A mind lab to easy go up into the go up
in northern California where all the

158
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,100
gold mines were.
That'd be cool.

159
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,010
Yeah.
That's a move,

160
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:41,020
right?
Yeah.

161
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,820
So how does that fucking thing work?
Because that works different than only

162
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:46,070
picks up gold.
Set it on gold.

163
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,690
Yeah.
This other one had like on the top of

164
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:52,691
the meter it has specific for gold iron.
It gives you different readings and then

165
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:55,130
this thing is called a pinpoint or
whatever that is.

166
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,700
I'm only interested in gold.
See,

167
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,770
I guarantee you this is one of those
things that there's a fucking rabbit

168
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:03,530
hole and you start with this,
and next thing you know,

169
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:06,230
you're kidding.
Minor magazine in the mail,

170
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,340
you're subscribing to these websites
where people go on these,

171
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,473
these,
uh,

172
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,500
metal detector.
Your wife comes into your but Dan and

173
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,750
you have a miner's helmet with a light
on it.

174
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,580
Aren't you coming to bed
late?

175
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:21,414
A minute,
honey,

176
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,371
for real.
Like,

177
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:25,700
what?
Then you find out about a treasure

178
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:27,600
somewhere and you go,
oh,

179
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,940
I can find it.
Oh yeah,

180
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,190
that's pretty hard to find.
Well,

181
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,230
have you ever seen those documentaries
on those guys that are professional

182
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:34,850
shipwreck hunters?
No.

183
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,620
Dude is.
There's real crazy money in that real.

184
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:43,190
And if they know we're a viking ship
went down or Roman ship went down,

185
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:46,100
they know where they're pretty sure that
there's some gold.

186
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,840
There has been several times that they
have.

187
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,720
Let's find out actually what the biggest
bounty was,

188
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,980
lot.
Let's take a guess.

189
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,250
Well you've got to figure the
technology's probably just improved,

190
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,350
right?
And like the last 30 years,

191
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,030
right.
Has made such a jump,

192
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,390
so why it's probably a good time to do
it.

193
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,890
People have been probably trying to
search but couldn't go down too deep or.

194
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,600
Well,
they're really good at it now you know,

195
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,150
there,
but it's also the ocean is fucking huge.

196
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,460
So if you find something,
the odds of somebody else finding it

197
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,490
without you telling them about it and
without somebody leaking some

198
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:20,990
information so it's really touch and go
and these guys invest a shitload of

199
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,000
money.
So they have the divers who are these

200
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:25,250
people that are usually the people that
are knowledgeable but they don't really

201
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:28,100
have the funds and then they meet
somebody and that guy funds it,

202
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,020
but it's super squirrely.

203
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,090
Like who gets the money and how much do
you get?

204
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,250
And his brothers,
like a coke dealer,

205
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,230
right?
Someone's got a gun,

206
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,260
someone's got her girlfriends to Tan.
Everything's just super confusing.

207
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,000
She's really friendly.
She being so nice to me.

208
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,970
She want to fuck,
this is going to be murder suicide.

209
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:47,400
It's,
it's all gonna.

210
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,270
Go down,
I watched this one and these,

211
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:51,740
uh,
these guys had found,

212
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,530
I want to say it was more than a hundred
million dollars in gold.

213
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,810
Oh my God.
They had found at the bottom of the

214
00:08:57,811 --> 00:08:58,890
ocean,
but I might be making that.

215
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,340
That's a really good one.
I found their operations have to be

216
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,820
related to the discovery of the San
Jose,

217
00:09:04,821 --> 00:09:09,821
Shipwreck and Columbia and 2015.
How much.

218
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,150
Okay,
let me guess

219
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,440
really high.
It's really,

220
00:09:15,441 --> 00:09:18,200
really done.
That do.

221
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,080
You shouldn't have done that.
I would've come in low.

222
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,130
San Jose.
I was going to say two point

223
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:24,980
$4,000,000,000.
Woo.

224
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,830
That's a lot.
I'm going to say one point $8 billion.

225
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,810
I never would have said billion by the
way.

226
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,090
He didn't say that.
Okay.

227
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,810
One point eight.
Okay.

228
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,160
What did I say?
Two point something.

229
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:40,490
Two point 4 billion.
Jesus Christ to discovery the San Jose

230
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:44,520
shipwreck has all the elements of a
great drama,

231
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:48,570
international political intrigue,
a treasure of golden emeralds worth up

232
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:49,870
to $17,
billion.

233
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:54,180
And now accusations of lying.
Everyone always forgets about emeralds.

234
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,490
Everyone forgets about emeralds.
I sleep on Emerald,

235
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,910
I sleep on them all the time.
I never take them seriously.

236
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,280
He's like,
he's like,

237
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:06,350
Yo,
look at my emeralds.

238
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,020
That's not even the best rock you could
get.

239
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,930
And then weird emeralds,
emeralds,

240
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,320
and they're only for women who just
shiny everything other than diamonds are

241
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:17,910
producers and diamonds aren't really for
dudes.

242
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
They met for dudes.
I know they're all for women mostly,

243
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:23,790
but a guy can wear some diamonds,
like rappers wear diamonds.

244
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,310
It looks fly.
It's sparkly.

245
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,140
Girls like sparkles,
but rappers can't wear a ruby's.

246
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,200
Right.
Nice.

247
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,660
Ruby,
check out my ruby red teaming up.

248
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,110
They can.
Someone's wearing ruby's bawling.

249
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,750
My Rubio.
Of course they are.

250
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,790
What about emeralds?
Can they were emeralds?

251
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,280
I bet conor mcgregor.
Where the fuck out of some emeralds.

252
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,570
Oh Man.
Being all Irish and chin.

253
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,110
Yeah,
just a big Irish.

254
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:50,760
The sash and were like,
oh,

255
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:53,590
like a chest plate man.
I am.

256
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,410
Roads mean looking at my am roads and if
you're wearing turquoise and you're not

257
00:10:58,411 --> 00:10:59,250
native American.

258
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,140
I got questions.
Yeah,

259
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,510
right.
If you really turquoise and silver.

260
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,570
Yeah.
Slow down buddy from New Mexico.

261
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,020
Show me your artwork.
Show me that you're really kicking ass

262
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:13,590
with some Indian artwork because it's
not showing me the guy on the horse.

263
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,390
I know you have it.
You fuck.

264
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,011
Let me see.
The dream.

265
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:22,011
Catchers are selling
like a man with a turquoise bracelet.

266
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,720
Oh Man.
There was a place called the Silverman

267
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,080
when I was in school.
It was a in New Jersey near my high

268
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,140
school and when I was first getting into
girls,

269
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:39,150
that's where I would go to buy jewelry.
That gifts to my girl.

270
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,410
I don't remember being there.
Like I wonder.

271
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,610
I wonder if I could wear some of this
myself.

272
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,690
That's hilarious.
The Silverman,

273
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,130
I remember there was a movie that was
his great wrestling movie called vision

274
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,820
with Matthew Modine

275
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,510
and his friend on the show is this
native American kid turned out to not

276
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:00,280
really be native American.
Ah.

277
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,580
It turned out that that was like his big
hustle in the movie was that he was

278
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:06,490
telling everybody who's native American
talking about you going on a vision

279
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:09,100
quest and your spirit journey and all
this stuff.

280
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,220
Because I don't know what it was.
I don't remember,

281
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,900
but I remember that in the movie.
Yeah.

282
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:16,390
That dude right there.
That turned out to not really be native

283
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:17,830
American.
It was just bullshit.

284
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,620
Well,
bad on you,

285
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,880
Matthew Modine for thinking that it was
a.

286
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,140
It looks native American.
Yeah.

287
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,520
It looks more like culture club.
It looks like an Indian man.

288
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:28,211
Come on.
Oh,

289
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:30,160
that's the guy from 16 candles.
Is it?

290
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,240
Same Guy?
Yeah.

291
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,100
The guy who was really ringwald really
loved.

292
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,971
Oh really?
Yeah.

293
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:34,720
I remember that one.

294
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,440
You know too much about those movies.
It was the eighties.

295
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,100
I want it to be that guy because he was
like the cool guy,

296
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:44,890
but he was so cool.
He didn't hang out with the cool people

297
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,160
and Molly ringwald fell in love with
him.

298
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,620
That is the movie that wrestlers watch
for inspiration.

299
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:52,690
Quest Vision quest.
That is the movie.

300
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,910
Yeah,
that is.

301
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,110
That is an amazing movie.
Isn't really good.

302
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,200
Stocks today.
You'd probably go back and watch it

303
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:00,820
today.
It's probably like altered states.

304
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,710
A lot of synthesizer.
Yeah.

305
00:13:02,711 --> 00:13:04,630
I've recommended altered states to be
blend.

306
00:13:04,631 --> 00:13:07,040
I went back and watched it myself.
I had to come back on the air and go,

307
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,210
okay,
sorry.

308
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,830
Do you people.
I saw rob.

309
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,310
Do you have an hour and a half of your
life?

310
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,400
I remember thinking it was cool.
It wasn't the day.

311
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:16,750
I mean,
it was really cool.

312
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,640
It was really cool when the movie came
out.

313
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,650
I loved.
Movies are just different now.

314
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,290
Yeah.
Unless you see like the Godfather,

315
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,550
the godfather 100 percent holds up
totally for the shining,

316
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,190
the shining 100 percent wholesale.
One hundred percent.

317
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,770
One hundred percent caddyshack.
Oh yeah.

318
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,410
Caddyshack is fantastic.
Blues Brothers,

319
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,380
Blues Brothers back to school.
Yeah.

320
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,470
Come on.
So that means that maybe altered states

321
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:46,180
wasn't that great.
It was different and there was a book by

322
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:49,360
a lot on the different.
It was an intriguing story.

323
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,270
The whole thing was crazy.
You have this brilliant doctor and this

324
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:54,640
beautiful girlfriend who was also a
scientist too,

325
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:56,830
or think you don't remember.
Um,

326
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,860
and so he takes this shout shamonic drug
and it changes him.

327
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,530
He morphs back into a monkey and he
breaks in the zoo and kills things.

328
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:06,370
Right?
That's right.

329
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:10,090
I remember right.
He was in the with like blood on his

330
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:10,720
face.
Yeah.

331
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,350
Killed something in the zoo.
Right.

332
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,890
The movie was based,
not really,

333
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:19,891
but based or I should say inspired by a
guy named John Lilly who made the

334
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:22,900
isolation tank.
There was an isolation tank in it.

335
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:25,060
Yeah,
that's actually how I found out about

336
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:29,470
this movie in the movie.
He actually goes through several

337
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,030
generations of Lilly's isolation tanks
and sort of an Ommaya,

338
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,140
like he starts out floating with the,
uh,

339
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,930
the head given where it's like a scuba
tank,

340
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,470
a helmet on.
That's the beginning of the movie.

341
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,070
Then the end of the movie,
he's lying down.

342
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:43,480
See,
that's how I really did it in the

343
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:47,020
beginning and the beginning.
Lily had it set up where there was

344
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:51,860
literally like a tube connected to his
asshole so he could shit and into the

345
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:54,680
water and it would be filtered out.
So we never had to leave the water.

346
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,970
Well,
that would be good for road trips and he

347
00:14:58,971 --> 00:14:59,750
would,
uh,

348
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,430
lily would do it with ketamine.

349
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:05,060
He would shoot up ketamine,
which is like a cat tranquilizer.

350
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,280
I'm not really close to before.
It works with.

351
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,260
That looks claustrophobic.
It's not.

352
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,323
No,
no.

353
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,710
I had done that one.
I've never done that one.

354
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:17,890
The one I've done is later in the movie
as his character evolves and as the plot

355
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:22,200
evolves later in the movie,
he has like a more modern version,

356
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,160
the isolation tank where he's like
laying flat and they don't ever

357
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:28,850
mentioned that he figured out a better
version or anything like that.

358
00:15:28,851 --> 00:15:31,760
They just kind of put it in there,
which is pretty fascinating.

359
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:33,650
It's pretty cool.
So he really was into it.

360
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,630
You'll see the,
the top one.

361
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,760
Okay.
I guess the top one is the tube is

362
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:40,310
coming out of the top of the tooth,
but there was another one we laid flat.

363
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,770
What's the actor's name again?
That was William hurt.

364
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,700
William hurt?
Yeah,

365
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,650
he was cool.
He's a bad motherfucker.

366
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:47,570
Remember him in broadcast news?
Yes.

367
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,450
He was so good.
He's been in a bunch of great movies.

368
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,180
Yeah,
he just came back recently in something.

369
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:55,760
I forget what it was,
but that John Lilly guy who made that

370
00:15:55,761 --> 00:16:00,761
tank was a like a legitimate,
brilliant scientist who would take all

371
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:02,330
kinds of shit.
Oh yeah,

372
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,770
he would experiment all the time.
He was,

373
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,630
he was a pioneer in interspecies
communication research with dolphins.

374
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,910
Really.
You don't know if you've ever heard this

375
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:13,070
story,
but the woman who was doing the

376
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:16,010
research,
she was living with a young male dolphin

377
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,520
and she lived in this place that was
like waist high and water,

378
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,240
but so she would walk through the water
to get to a furniture to get to where

379
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:26,300
she would cook and the dolphin lived
with her and swam around with her.

380
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:26,871
Wait,
wait.

381
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:28,640
So she would be like up to her waist
like.

382
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,410
Yeah,
in the hallways and then she got to come

383
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:35,240
up to a platform to cook or she had some
setup where she lived with this dolphin.

384
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,100
Wow.
They all.

385
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,750
They lived in this tank.
Never heard of.

386
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:42,110
This is crazy and when she did it,
she was there.

387
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,000
Were working on these ideas that they
had to try to get dolphins to recreate

388
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:49,100
human words like.
But the dolphins,

389
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,740
even if they're not as intelligent as we
are,

390
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,480
which they might be,
who knows?

391
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,600
They don't have the ability to make the
sounds that we make because they they

392
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,730
have.
They don't have lips and tongue.

393
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:01,430
Yeah.
They have a weird way of making noises.

394
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,960
Yeah.
So they,

395
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,740
they would see the dolphin came super
close to saying hello,

396
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,660
Kim.
Really close to it.

397
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,100
It's kind of weird when you hear it too.

398
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,790
There was a movie done where they were
talking to the dolphins and they and it

399
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:14,280
was like,
yeah,

400
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,640
she had a sexual relationship.
You're pulling that up positive to get

401
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:17,474
to that.
Jamie,

402
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,870
do you remember that movie?
Yes.

403
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,410
This is why they canceled it.
Oh,

404
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,260
does it say it says a woman in a
waterproofed house in 1964,

405
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:28,930
a woman lived in a waterproof health
with a,

406
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,240
with a dolphin called Peter tried to
teach them English and had a sexual

407
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:33,140
relationship with them.
Oh,

408
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:37,820
my sword of she would jerk him off
because he would get super horny and

409
00:17:37,821 --> 00:17:40,730
that's all he would want to do is fuck.
And he was confusing and it was

410
00:17:40,731 --> 00:17:43,700
interfering with the research.
So she didn't think there was anything

411
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:45,380
wrong with jerking off this dolphin.
Yeah.

412
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:47,030
I don't either.
Look,

413
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,710
there's nothing wrong with it.
Hey.

414
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,520
It's like they live together.

415
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,230
Well.
What?

416
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,310
Why are we so weird about sexual
pleasure?

417
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,900
Like,
what the fuck is that?

418
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,450
Man?
We're so weird.

419
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,790
It is a weird.
It's very complicated.

420
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,980
It's the driving force of all of us and
it's,

421
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,323
you know,
it's,

422
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,500
it's a bent and twisted and it's pure
and it's nice and it's,

423
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,450
it's a weird thing,
right?

424
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:12,630
But if you have friend,
like I had a friend who's a jerk off his

425
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:17,631
dog with his foot,
doesn't have that friend he got,

426
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,790
I go free.
Real lucky touch.

427
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,740
We put my sock on and I said,
what'd you do?

428
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:24,260
He goes,
he was fucking dogs.

429
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,520
Dogs horny.
So put my foot on his dick.

430
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:28,770
And I rubbed it back and forth and he
came all over stomach.

431
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:32,610
I was seriously,
he felt better and I go,

432
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,301
you know what,
man?

433
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:35,250
I think it's me.
I don't think it's you.

434
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,160
I think it's me.
I think it's made with a stupid problem

435
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:39,930
in my head about it.
The dog likes it.

436
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,990
How come you can scratch behind the
dog's ears where he can't reach and

437
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:44,630
that's okay.
But come,

438
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,780
you can't rub his dick.
Have you ever touched your dog's Dick?

439
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:50,100
Accidentally when you're rubbing his
belly?

440
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,050
My dog has a vagina.
Okay.

441
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,330
And um,
I've never touched it.

442
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,141
No,
never.

443
00:18:55,141 --> 00:18:56,820
Accidentally.
Well,

444
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,930
no,
I don't think so.

445
00:18:57,931 --> 00:19:00,480
Touch my dog's Dick 100 times and he's
only five months old.

446
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,550
It's flying all over the place.

447
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,000
Only nine months old.
And uh,

448
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,770
she's in the vet right now.
Actually,

449
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,490
I got it.
I got a call her.

450
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,710
I left in a,

451
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,710
it could have been a snake.
Could it have been a snake?

452
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,160
That's.
Did she get,

453
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:18,320
she just looking swollen and puffy.
And this rattlesnake season is happens

454
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:20,750
all the time.
You have a lab?

455
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,550
Black Larry Possible.
She got bit,

456
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:24,590
my dog's been bit many times.
Really?

457
00:19:24,591 --> 00:19:25,020
Yeah.
My,

458
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,340
my two dogs that had been bitter dead
now.

459
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,600
But they,
um,

460
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,780
they,
one dog got bit and I took him to the

461
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:37,070
vet and he,
I knew he got bit and swell up yet I

462
00:19:37,071 --> 00:19:39,560
took her to the vet and he was so
excited because he'd killed a

463
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,900
rattlesnake,
was all fired up and you know,

464
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,440
he'd killed a rattlesnake.
Oh yeah.

465
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,141
Well,
you know,

466
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,530
okay,
this is a disaster.

467
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,161
Oh really?
Yeah.

468
00:19:46,161 --> 00:19:47,360
Once he got to,
once it bit him,

469
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:48,171
he was like,
fuck,

470
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:50,470
you tore this thing apart.
And Nice.

471
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,940
Um,
that was Frank Sinatra.

472
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,200
That was my dog named Frank.
Oh,

473
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,420
that's awesome.
But uh,

474
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,610
he wasn't swollen when I brought him to
the vet.

475
00:19:58,611 --> 00:20:01,970
Then when I got him home he started
swelling up like a half hour later it

476
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:05,020
starts swelling up and then it just gets
like to these cartoonish proportions,

477
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,430
but half their faces hanging off.
Yeah,

478
00:20:07,431 --> 00:20:09,010
it's a,
she was just asking

479
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,960
a little weird this morning and you
know,

480
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,020
we have a yard.
So like,

481
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,820
I don't know,
maybe someone got into the backyard,

482
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:15,860
I don't know,
but she,

483
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:19,850
all of a sudden her,
I was a little puffy and I said to my

484
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,060
wife would look at her eyes,
she look a little weird.

485
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,810
She was like,
I think she's having a reaction.

486
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,690
So he brought her into the vet on my way
here and uh,

487
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,640
they rushed her right in and they're
like,

488
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,340
good thing you got here early and
they're going to work on her.

489
00:20:31,341 --> 00:20:33,440
So I don't know what's up,
but we're trying to figure,

490
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,340
uh,
we can they get sick from eating,

491
00:20:37,341 --> 00:20:40,700
raccoon feces.
Ever hear that?

492
00:20:40,701 --> 00:20:40,870
I would

493
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,380
not imagine it'd be good for you.
I noticed because we had a trainer that

494
00:20:44,381 --> 00:20:45,970
was like,
she's not eating that is here.

495
00:20:45,971 --> 00:20:46,631
I'm like,
no.

496
00:20:46,631 --> 00:20:47,500
I mean,
is that big deal?

497
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:48,670
I mean,
she eats everything.

498
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,140
He's like a goat.
Yeah.

499
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,493
I'm like,
as,

500
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,890
that's the only thing I could think of
because I couldn't.

501
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,660
Well,
there's definitely got to be something

502
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:56,470
in that.
I mean,

503
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,020
raccoons have to have parasites.
They're wild animals.

504
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:00,910
Yeah.
It's got to have some weird.

505
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,610
They're wild animals too.
And they eat animals,

506
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,740
so as soon as an animal is eating other
animals,

507
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:08,560
that's when shit gets weird right now
for wild animal.

508
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:10,710
Like you could eat a deer raw.
Right?

509
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,560
And there'd be no problem at all.
Oh yeah.

510
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,260
Yeah.
The real problem is animals that eat

511
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:17,590
animals
because the deer doesn't eat.

512
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:21,010
Animals kill the deer.
Could get a pair of side and deers have

513
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:21,910
gotten worms before.

514
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,690
I've heard of people that in lyme
disease that had.

515
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,191
No,
no,

516
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:26,860
no,
that's just the ticks cause severe

517
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:31,861
inflammatory reactions when that's not
really a specific around severe

518
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:36,820
inflammatory maybe will migrate to other
organs including the brain.

519
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,240
Oh Geez.
Well I,

520
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:41,440
I've had dogs that have worms before
that were coming out of there,

521
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:46,060
but like they poop and as they would
walk away you would see worms literally

522
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:47,200
crawling out of their butt and you're
like,

523
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:48,730
oh,
okay.

524
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,740
And your lifestyle have whacked you off.
When we had the kids

525
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,550
would be so confused.
Let me put on a sock.

526
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,470
Get over here.
So not true.

527
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,490
Yeah.
Parasitic relationships.

528
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,010
Like when you think about how many dogs
have worms is like one of the number one

529
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:08,130
things you got to do what your dog get
it dewormed.

530
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,590
Yeah.
So often.

531
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,760
So often just eating shit.
They eat everything.

532
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,490
Everything.
My dog ate a magnet.

533
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,020
You know how they have those magnets?
We stack magnet kids play with them.

534
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,340
Strong thick ass.
Heavy magnet.

535
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,190
Yeah.
I've found it in his shit.

536
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,990
Oh,
I'm surprised it came out.

537
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,700
You had came out,
came right out.

538
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,360
I mean dogs.
Intestinal tract is made out of

539
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:32,220
barbwire,
you know,

540
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:37,270
things just co writes shits and all of a
sudden a metal rollerskate comes up to

541
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,510
the ship.
Just a thrilling thing.

542
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:46,030
Nastiest dog I've ever had in terms of
eating his own shit.

543
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,440
This new one.
Yeah.

544
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:49,960
He tries to eat his own shit when he
doesn't anymore.

545
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:52,570
He stopped.
But I'm sure he has like recently.

546
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,730
But for the most part he does.
It's weird.

547
00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:56,650
Leaves it alone.
But when he was a puppy,

548
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,600
like when I just got him and he's a few
weeks old.

549
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,430
Yeah.
He would take a shit and literally

550
00:23:00,431 --> 00:23:03,040
trying to bite this shit as it's coming
out of his ass.

551
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:10,030
You would have to like grab him to keep
him from eating the shit as it was

552
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:12,640
coming.
He thought it was like a Mr. softy

553
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:17,450
machine.
I can't believe it comes right out of my

554
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,880
thing.
It's like,

555
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:19,990
look man,
I love you,

556
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:22,240
but you got to stop doing this.
Why Joe?

557
00:23:22,241 --> 00:23:23,650
You want get a cone?
A cone.

558
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,380
Come on.
But good thing is it made me like really

559
00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:28,490
diligent about scooping poop up in the
yard.

560
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,330
Dive on that.
You got to get it up quick,

561
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,620
quick.
Let them.

562
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,513
So we,
we,

563
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,220
we bought like a special trash can that
you just,

564
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,320
you know my other dogs going through the
same thing.

565
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,330
We're going through the same thing.
How old is,

566
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,890
he's a baby.
He's five months old.

567
00:23:41,891 --> 00:23:42,920
Yeah,
we're at nine months.

568
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,190
Babies are babies.
One that's in the hospital,

569
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,871
baby?
Yeah.

570
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:47,510
Nine months.
Yeah.

571
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:48,440
I hope she's okay.

572
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,050
She comes home with like mystery shit on
her head.

573
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,920
Like where did you even get this?
Just walks in all happy to see what the

574
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:57,320
big blob of shit or Emma has on our
head.

575
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,570
I killed a rattlesnake a month ago.
You did?

576
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,990
Really?
Yeah.

577
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,970
It's on a walkway.
I court where I was walking.

578
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:06,830
I was like,
fuck this by your house,

579
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,350
by a friend's house actually had you
kill it.

580
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,330
Stomped on it.
Just went up and stomped.

581
00:24:11,331 --> 00:24:12,930
Didn't try to bite.
You know?

582
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:15,230
I got to it before it got to me.
Oh really?

583
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,850
Yeah.
It wasn't a big rail snake,

584
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:17,684
but it's.
Well,

585
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,430
what kind of shoe?
Where were you were wearing?

586
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,030
I don't remember.
It'd be a nice boot.

587
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,640
It was definitely not a wise move.
No,

588
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,410
no.
It was just something in me like said,

589
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,301
like,
first of all,

590
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,330
my friends would want me to kill this
isn't one fucking snake in his yard.

591
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,460
Words kids live.
Right.

592
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,930
And second of all,
um,

593
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,170
I think I could do it right now.
It was one of those things like,

594
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:41,880
I think this snake is slipping on me.
He's not looking.

595
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,630
It doesn't know because most people are
not going to just stomp your fucking

596
00:24:44,631 --> 00:24:45,980
head of your rattlesnake.
Yeah.

597
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,750
But I was like,
dad is the move right now.

598
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,710
Just try to.
Yeah,

599
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:51,200
the rattlesnakes instinct is humans run
from me.

600
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,053
Yeah.
And it's,

601
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:56,660
it's like you kinda see some people tell
you not supposed to do it.

602
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,520
Okay.
And I understand what they're saying.

603
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,370
Like I would not want all the rattle
snakes to die.

604
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:05,150
I'm not a rattlesnake hater,
but I have rules and if you get into my

605
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:06,430
house,
if you're a snake in your,

606
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:09,080
my house,
I'm going to fucking kill you for sure.

607
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,150
One hundred percent.
And it's not my house,

608
00:25:11,151 --> 00:25:14,210
but I mean it was in front of my
friend's house and he has kids.

609
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,590
That's a dead snake.
Yeah.

610
00:25:15,591 --> 00:25:18,020
Kill that sense.
I personally would not have done it,

611
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,780
but it was a garter snake.
It was like,

612
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,410
I've seen those.
I don't bother them.

613
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,460
No,
they're not.

614
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,930
Where they're going to gum you to death.
No.

615
00:25:23,931 --> 00:25:27,260
But this guy also has a little dogs to
dogs get jacked.

616
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,360
Maybe she got bit by a snake.
Oh Dude.

617
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,440
Easily,
easily happen.

618
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,830
I've had three dogs.
Bit By rattlesnakes in California.

619
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:34,760
Yeah,
they're all over.

620
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:36,280
I almost got bit by one.
I was,

621
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:39,260
while I was hiking down a little trail,
I might have said this last time I was

622
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:43,400
walking down a trail and uh,
my wife was behind me and uh,

623
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,750
it was a narrow part and I just came
around the corner and the thing just

624
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:49,010
went,
oh,

625
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,450
fuck,
right at me.

626
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,210
And I just backed up.
I just ran right past.

627
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,520
My wife says,
why are we running?

628
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,150
And they came back and he was pissed off
at the edge of the trail and this little

629
00:25:59,151 --> 00:26:03,050
Bush and uh,
I just threw rocks at it and ran past

630
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:03,710
it.
Coulda.

631
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,990
Got You.
I can totally.

632
00:26:04,991 --> 00:26:06,830
Then when this is now,
that's the thing,

633
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:10,550
and I'm still not clear on it.
We're two miles up in the mountain.

634
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,410
They say you're not supposed to move or
else you'll get it pumping through your

635
00:26:15,411 --> 00:26:16,041
system.
Oh,

636
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,570
Jesus.
Do you make a tourniquet?

637
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,830
I don't know.
I don't know.

638
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,250
I still,
I should have learned since then,

639
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:26,000
but the idea that my wife would have
carried me out doesn't make sense.

640
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,820
We'll go for help,
right.

641
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,000
Is kind of tough,
you know,

642
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:31,250
two mile hike down the mountain and
back.

643
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,530
They make snake proof boots.
You should look into him.

644
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,650
Maybe snakes like you maybe like one of
those people that like,

645
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,360
people like mosquitoes,
mosquitoes,

646
00:26:38,361 --> 00:26:41,600
like people you know,
like I could be right next to it by all

647
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,980
the mosquitoes everywhere.
There's rattlesnakes.

648
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,960
There's no problem.
You said you cook.

649
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,940
Oh,
I brought you bread.

650
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,230
Oh fuck.
You know,

651
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:52,080
I know.
I know you don't really eat it and I

652
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:55,770
don't want to mess with your condo and
elk thing or you eat it occasionally.

653
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,630
But look at.
Look at the bag that I have.

654
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,370
Okay.
I have these bags now.

655
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,590
Paper Bag.
This is how much the perfectly shaped

656
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:04,620
for these bread.
Oh look at that.

657
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:08,970
It does look really good,
but if a just came out this morning,

658
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,530
look at that.
Beautiful.

659
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,780
It smells amazing,
but I figured his art,

660
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,880
even art,
even if you don't want you to give it to

661
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:19,940
your family,
I'll eat a piece of that for a little.

662
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,530
A little butter.
Oh,

663
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:24,270
give it to the family tonight.
I've perfected my methods and so it was

664
00:27:24,271 --> 00:27:25,740
here last.
Wow.

665
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,440
You know,
it's really intense with that brand.

666
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,750
Do you ever hear of a gentleman's
breakfast?

667
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,350
No.
Pool comes from England.

668
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,870
London.
Is it like blood sausage or something?

669
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:41,490
Not as intense.
You take a butter at night.

670
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,650
Let it soften on the,
on the counter.

671
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:49,460
Chop up garlic and anchovies.
Mix it all together into the butter.

672
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:53,520
Put it in the fridge in the morning.
You toast some of that delicious

673
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:58,521
sourdough bread and thick layer of that
butter on it with some eggs on the side.

674
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,730
It's called the gentleman's breakfast.

675
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:08,610
There's something about first thing in
the morning,

676
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,200
garlic anchovy butter.
Dangerous.

677
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,540
Oh,
it's so good.

678
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:15,000
It's a bold choice.
You don't give a fuck about your breath.

679
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:15,863
No,
you're not.

680
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:19,110
You don't want to be near people that
you don't want to be near people for a

681
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:22,290
good day.
You might've just eradicated in morning

682
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:25,230
breath,
brush your teeth and then you got down

683
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:27,030
with this.
It sounds nasty,

684
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:29,940
but I'm telling you,
it is the most delicious thing I've ever

685
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:30,840
had.
Sounds amazing.

686
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:33,810
I want to do an amazing anchovies.
Garlic.

687
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:35,010
And what else?
Garlic.

688
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,540
Anchovies and butter.
That's it.

689
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,850
Just those three things.
Just let it soften.

690
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,580
Mix it all together.
Chop up the anchovies and the garlic.

691
00:28:41,581 --> 00:28:43,650
Really fine.
Throw it all in there.

692
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,710
Do you know what will ruin you if you
get real anchovies?

693
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,610
Like you ever get like fresh anchovies?
Like in Italy?

694
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,610
No.
Oh,

695
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,170
I mean maybe in a dish of something,
but yeah,

696
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,730
I've gotten fresh and trophies and fresh
sardines.

697
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,490
Sardines,
sardines in Sicily.

698
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,170
Amazing.
You go with this.

699
00:29:01,171 --> 00:29:02,260
Women.
This is what a sardine.

700
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,210
Yeah.
It's not all covered in Goo.

701
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,280
Thick paint.
Like oil mustard.

702
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,470
Yeah.
So fresh anchovies.

703
00:29:10,471 --> 00:29:13,710
I have never who that would make the
gentleman's breakfast even better.

704
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:18,711
I bet it would have like when you get
like a really good Caesar Salad at a

705
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,380
really good restaurant and they do it by
the table.

706
00:29:22,381 --> 00:29:24,750
The real old school.
Yeah.

707
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:28,200
And it takes like 10 minutes.
He's there working on that thing in

708
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:29,700
front of you.
That'd be like,

709
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,440
yeah,
that's a real old school move,

710
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:33,210
right?
Like some show and frank's type thing.

711
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,230
That's right.
They don't.

712
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:34,801
Yeah.
Oh,

713
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:36,720
I love Musso and frank's.
Oh,

714
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,690
is that place 100 years old?
It's the oldest restaurant in la.

715
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,380
Yeah,
I think it's one years.

716
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:43,720
I think you're reading.
It's like 1915 or something like that.

717
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:47,020
Yeah,
you get a Martini in that place.

718
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,750
It is just.
It's just perfect.

719
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,750
They know what they're doing.
It's all old school stuff.

720
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,540
It will keep the stakes.
They put it in a tiny glass instead of

721
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:59,350
these giant glasses like they use now
it's a smaller glass and then they give

722
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:03,040
you the extra in ice on the side of your
glass.

723
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,180
Those guys and they look.
Any place that has a 70 year old guy

724
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:09,700
waiting on you in a uniform.
Look at that.

725
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,140
Yeah,
that guy.

726
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,390
Then you know you're in good shape.
Let's go there.

727
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,780
Let's go there one night for dinner.
We should.

728
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,460
We should.
We should go before the store.

729
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,950
Yes.
Go for steaks and a bunch of guys

730
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:21,880
together.
Yes,

731
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,660
girl come,
eh?

732
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,750
The problem is girls don't really like
it there.

733
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:31,520
I've taken girls,
they're my wife's downloaded and they're

734
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,860
not that into it.
They don't like an old man's pickle

735
00:30:33,861 --> 00:30:38,861
fingers given you your meat
that turns the ladies off.

736
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:43,180
But funny though,
those places that still have that kind

737
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:44,200
of.
There's like,

738
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:46,670
you can't fake that in a mall,
you know?

739
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,870
You know what I mean?
You have like a new Musso and frank's.

740
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,100
Yeah,
there's like a.

741
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,480
what's the Rayos in New York?
It's like five tables.

742
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:58,240
It's hard to get into.
It's like where Joe Torry eats with

743
00:30:58,241 --> 00:31:02,450
Derek jeter and Giuliani,
the inside this Musan.

744
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,460
Frank's Mussa.
Yeah.

745
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,023
God,
it looks awesome.

746
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,500
I sat at that bar with a couple friends.
I've sat in that booth,

747
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:11,620
like the curve booth at the back with my
wife and a friend.

748
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,410
What's that one?
Steakhouse in New York where they hang

749
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,960
pipes from the sealant.

750
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,980
Is it called keen's?
What is it called?

751
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,510
Keen's.
The clay pipes.

752
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:20,530
Is that the name of it?
Yeah.

753
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:25,150
Am I seeing the right name?
Keens k e h n e phenomenal steakhouse.

754
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,610
And um,
for some reason,

755
00:31:27,611 --> 00:31:29,740
like back in the day,
like famous people would bring their

756
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:32,020
pipe and they would hang the pipe on the
wall.

757
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:35,260
They would give you a pipe,
they would give you a clay pipe and they

758
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:37,270
have pipes that from everyone that's
smoked them,

759
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:41,860
they're Einstein Pattern,
Roosevelt,

760
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:46,150
all of these people and they ended the
place is covered with it and then I roll

761
00:31:46,151 --> 00:31:51,151
in there for the first time in 2001 when
the smoking ban has gone into effect and

762
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:57,460
you're not allowed to smoke a pipe in
this legendary place.

763
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,730
I've felt so cheated,
cheated,

764
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,890
like when I be like,
well,

765
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,030
when I went through puberty and aids
showed up,

766
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,650
you know what I mean?

767
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,750
It's like,
why us?

768
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,630
Why can't I smoke and put my pipe next
to Albert Einstein's?

769
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,310
Yeah.
When I was.

770
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,610
When I was 16 or 17,
if I remember correctly,

771
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:19,930
they raise the drinking age to 21.
It used to be 18.

772
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,310
Yeah,
that's right.

773
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,280
That's right.
Eighteen months.

774
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,430
Twenty one.
Just missed it.

775
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,690
We did.
Just miss it.

776
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,770
Wow.
Look at these.

777
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,960
Babe Ruth.
Babe Ruth Pipe.

778
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:35,350
Peewee Herman.
Now limit different kind of pipe.

779
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:39,680
Hey,
wow.

780
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,840
Theodore Roosevelt's pipe.
Whoa.

781
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:44,480
Look at that.
And then we roll in there and we're not

782
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:45,830
allowed.
Come on.

783
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:49,880
I know it's like that week I understands
cleaning up the city and stopping people

784
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:54,881
from having cancer,
but of one night buffalo bills pipe

785
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:58,130
buffalo bill,
they have a beautiful nude behind the

786
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,330
bar to this huge paintings.
Yeah.

787
00:33:01,331 --> 00:33:04,100
Keans.
It's a beautiful painting of this

788
00:33:04,101 --> 00:33:07,070
beautiful ceiling at one ceiling.
We see all the pipes.

789
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:08,620
Jamie,
look at that.

790
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,940
That's crazy.
Yeah,

791
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:12,710
it shouldn't.
Joe Rogan's pipe be up there.

792
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,860
Not Be faking it.
I've only been there twice.

793
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,720
I know,
but I've only smoked a pipe.

794
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:19,600
Wants on this show.
I like,

795
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,550
I like a nice pipe once in a while.
What happened at pipe smoking?

796
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:27,710
Where'd it go?
I don't know because they're so much

797
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:29,450
more pleasant to people that are around
you.

798
00:33:29,451 --> 00:33:31,280
Like a cigar drives everyone out of the
room.

799
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,630
I love cigars,
but I likes her.

800
00:33:32,631 --> 00:33:34,610
There are so they're rude.
But uh,

801
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,520
you smoke a pipe.
The ladies aren't as offended.

802
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,460
Why is that?
Because it's more aromatic.

803
00:33:40,461 --> 00:33:44,750
It's Perfumey two gentleman's craft.
I have a pipe in my,

804
00:33:44,751 --> 00:33:47,030
uh,
in my little pencil case,

805
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,290
hybrid here.
I just take it out.

806
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:49,910
I don't smoke it,
I just walk around with it.

807
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,180
Pack One and right now for you.
These guys with their pipes.

808
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,220
Pipes.
No wheat.

809
00:33:55,221 --> 00:33:57,050
Huh?
Why can't we be like that?

810
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,550
I don't know what happened to us.
I don't know.

811
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,690
A bunch of babies.
Such babies worried about cancer.

812
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,510
I understand trying to help people with
the cancer and all that,

813
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:08,510
but none of that one place.
Can't keen still smoke.

814
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,710
There should be places that you could go
there like a club.

815
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,350
I go to the Soho Cigar bar when I'm in
New York.

816
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,740
That's a nice little spot.
I've,

817
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:22,930
I've smoked there with Chappelle and uh,
Allen Havey grabber.

818
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:24,710
Kelly.
It's a great hang.

819
00:34:24,711 --> 00:34:26,870
You Go and you sit like gentlemen,
Gentlemen,

820
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,930
Gentlemen.
Just discuss your life and you meditate

821
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:32,150
after the day.
It's a beautiful thing.

822
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,490
Yeah.
You could do that in a cigar bar.

823
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,190
This is a place that I go.
You can order food and you could smoke

824
00:34:37,191 --> 00:34:38,210
cigars.
It's great.

825
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,310
It's amazing.
It's good.

826
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,030
Good restaurant to that.
Smells good.

827
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,043
It does smell good.
Right?

828
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,560
Thank you.
Steven crowder for the lovely pipe

829
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,600
tobacco problem with the pipes.
You've got to keep it going now.

830
00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:49,880
Could you,
whenever you see at the Improv and

831
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:52,250
stuff,
that picture of Jay Leno with his pipe

832
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,610
in the old days when he was playing the
Improv like we are,

833
00:34:55,611 --> 00:34:57,980
he would smoke.
He would carry his pipe around.

834
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:02,030
Could someone pull that off?
Could somebody do that today?

835
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,480
You'd have to do a lot of drugs.
You'd have to be like that hunter s

836
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:08,180
Thompson guy that does so much drugs.
We'll let you have a cigarette holder.

837
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,130
Right?
Remember when Hunter s Thompson used to

838
00:35:10,131 --> 00:35:13,240
rock a cigarette holder?
Nobody else rocked a cigarette holder,

839
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,270
done hills.
In the end.

840
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,020
He did it because he was just so far out
there that everybody was like,

841
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:19,100
it's fine.
Right?

842
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,680
It's real.
I guess you'd have to have really

843
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,650
kickass material like you couldn't be
happy with a pipe.

844
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,000
Yeah.
Chris Rock and rock a pipe.

845
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,020
Yeah.
If you have killer,

846
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,880
killer material,
you could have a.

847
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,260
You can do whatever you like.
Chris Rock.

848
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:33,920
Now that he's divorced to go onstage,
one of those who have nerve lord jackets

849
00:35:33,921 --> 00:35:35,450
on Velvet,
right?

850
00:35:35,451 --> 00:35:38,040
It'd be velvet jacket on,
a smoking jacket.

851
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:40,080
Smoking pipe.
I have one of those.

852
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,040
Yeah,
it's a red from brooks brothers is nice,

853
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:43,903
nice.
Smokey,

854
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,100
deep pockets.
Like you put all your pipes and lighters

855
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:49,740
in it.
Do you walk around your house like in

856
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:51,900
your underwear with a robe on ever?
Uh,

857
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:54,450
yeah.
Do you closed?

858
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,630
But yeah,
I wear a robe because it's all girls in

859
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:58,560
my,
in my place.

860
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:03,330
It's weird to.
At what age is it inappropriate for kids

861
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:05,490
to see your deck?
Uh,

862
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:09,750
I would say for boys,
no age for boys.

863
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:10,531
No Age.
The boys?

864
00:36:10,531 --> 00:36:13,180
No age for girls.
Um,

865
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,390
I'm going to say like three,
four,

866
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,950
like three,
four years.

867
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,550
They're pretty really.
They would climb into the shower and

868
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,790
like point and the laughter that let
them look at it.

869
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:26,400
They can't see it now.
What if you climb of the shower and

870
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:27,390
they're right there.
Do you hide?

871
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,460
Yeah,
like when I come out of the shower I've

872
00:36:29,461 --> 00:36:32,800
got to walk down this little hallway and
that door is sometimes opening.

873
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:37,820
It's towards my daughter's rooms and uh,
I'm really conscious of and it's such a

874
00:36:39,121 --> 00:36:40,710
weird.
I catch myself a lot.

875
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:44,460
I'm totally naked,
but as long as I put everything in my

876
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:47,580
palm of my hand,
that would be okay if they happen to

877
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:49,140
catch me too.
My sister weird.

878
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,500
My seven year old stands in front of
shower door points in my deck and laughs

879
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,673
at seven.

880
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,400
My youngest is hilarious.
She's really funny,

881
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:00,530
man.
She's just like,

882
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,870
all she wants to do is go for the laugh
like all the time.

883
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:07,650
She's constantly just going for the lab
and that's her thing is that she's like

884
00:37:07,651 --> 00:37:09,000
really silly,
but yeah.

885
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,410
And so like,
she's like really silly at school.

886
00:37:11,411 --> 00:37:13,620
She's really silly at home.
That's my little one.

887
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,300
She just loves having fun.
Yeah.

888
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,850
Good student.
Yeah,

889
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,360
she's real good.
She's a great kid,

890
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,810
which is really interesting to see kids
grow up without the same kind of

891
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:26,870
financial pressure that I grew up with
or that you grew up with two or the not

892
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:28,930
the same kind of weirdness in the house
he had.

893
00:37:28,931 --> 00:37:30,670
There's no like when the dad isn't.
It's,

894
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,140
it's Dan.
That's when dad's not freaking out that

895
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:35,400
too.
And also,

896
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,980
you know,
I just think people know more about

897
00:37:37,981 --> 00:37:38,880
people now.

898
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,680
Oh,
I think our parents didn't even have a

899
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:42,030
chance.
No,

900
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,280
they were trying.
They didn't even understand themselves.

901
00:37:44,281 --> 00:37:48,750
Let alone understand time with you and
what was going to make you feel good and

902
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:50,790
most likely they were crazy young.
Like how old were you?

903
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,030
Twenty?
Yeah,

904
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,780
my mom was 20 or 21.
She was 20 when she got pregnant.

905
00:37:54,781 --> 00:37:55,410
Twenty one.
Chad.

906
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,160
Me?
Yeah.

907
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,020
If I can go back and think about when I
was 20.

908
00:37:58,021 --> 00:38:00,540
If somebody told me how to raise a kid
at 20.

909
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:02,130
Yeah.
Oh my God.

910
00:38:02,131 --> 00:38:05,440
I'd have a grownup.
A psychopath right now that I've been

911
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:06,480
trying to manage.
Dude,

912
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:09,390
I'm sorry.
I got the whole thing wrong.

913
00:38:09,391 --> 00:38:12,930
I don't know how we can redo this.
I think about that sometimes.

914
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,050
You really have to let.
I let I let my parents off the hook all

915
00:38:16,051 --> 00:38:20,340
the time now just in my memories because
like when my dad said that to me,

916
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:22,380
he was.
He was 28.

917
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:27,000
You know what I mean?
He had no idea when he was 28 before the

918
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:28,350
Internet.
Yeah.

919
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,050
I think 28 today is way more
knowledgeable.

920
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,970
Yeah.
There's pockets of flat earthers and

921
00:38:32,971 --> 00:38:36,040
shit out there that ruined the curve,
but other than that,

922
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:41,340
28 today is way more knowledgeable I
think then 28 of 20 years ago and yet so

923
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:48,010
much more immature.
Maybe some in some ways,

924
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,680
but I think that's generalizing.
I mean it's think it's really hard to

925
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:53,770
say people today is you're talking about
so many people.

926
00:38:53,771 --> 00:38:56,140
You're talking about $350 million
people.

927
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,570
Yeah,
but you know the idea that people were

928
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:02,200
like men and women were raising
families,

929
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:07,210
doing all their hard work,
doing all that like very adult stuff.

930
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:11,680
There's an adolescence now that's
extended until your mid thirties.

931
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:13,150
That's true.
You know what I mean?

932
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:16,600
It's like they may not be as intelligent
because they don't have as much.

933
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,310
They didn't have as much knowledge and
stuff,

934
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,760
but they were grown ups.
There was a distinction like I'm doing

935
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:24,190
grown up shit now.
Do you think that's almost like an

936
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:27,370
evolutionary course?
Like life gets easier and then people

937
00:39:27,371 --> 00:39:29,980
learn more about stuff,
but they don't have the same sort of

938
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:32,670
physical resolve that people did back in
the old days.

939
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,140
They had to work harder.
Yeah,

940
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,670
maybe.
And also it's kind of like the two kind

941
00:39:36,671 --> 00:39:39,040
of go together.
It seems like there's a direction that

942
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:40,560
people are moving into.
Yeah.

943
00:39:40,561 --> 00:39:41,750
And we'll think about it.
You know,

944
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,280
back then people were dying at 60,
70.

945
00:39:45,281 --> 00:39:49,390
Now if you're living to 100 W,
why shouldn't your twenties be a little

946
00:39:49,391 --> 00:39:51,610
more adolescent?
Yeah.

947
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,120
Because you're going to live so much
longer will apparently deliv longer

948
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:57,400
thing a big,
a big part of what the live longer thing

949
00:39:57,401 --> 00:39:58,061
is.
They,

950
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:00,850
um,
they reduced a lot of infant mortality

951
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,910
and a lot of is like the average of how
people die.

952
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,070
It's also infections when you're
younger.

953
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,320
Colon,
all sorts of things before medical

954
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:10,900
science.
But the actual age that people live to

955
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,700
hasn't really changed as much as people
think.

956
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,630
Really?
Yeah.

957
00:40:13,631 --> 00:40:15,460
I thought it did too,
but it's what it really is,

958
00:40:15,461 --> 00:40:15,900
is that.

959
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:20,610
Didn't Chris Ryan explained that to us?
I believe it was Dr Chris Ryan Phd.

960
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,210
Oh,
author of sex at dawn.

961
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,550
A good friend.
I know him well,

962
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,240
but he,
I believe he was one who educated us on

963
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:29,061
that.
That what,

964
00:40:29,061 --> 00:40:32,470
what's going on is that you're counting
in infant mortality.

965
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,200
I'm like,
used to be like,

966
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:37,060
if people got an infection,
like a blood infection before

967
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:37,861
antibiotics,
guests.

968
00:40:37,861 --> 00:40:38,550
Well,
you're dead.

969
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,580
Right.
You know what I mean?

970
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,350
You get septic,
guess what?

971
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:42,184
Your Dad.
Yeah.

972
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,653
Yeah.
Your Dad.

973
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,910
Rabies.
You're dead snake bite.

974
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:46,744
Yeah,
your dad.

975
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,060
Everybody's dead.
But yeah.

976
00:40:49,061 --> 00:40:50,570
But are people living like,
aren't there,

977
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,580
there's more like a 90 year old people
aren't there?

978
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,330
I don't.
I would like to find that out.

979
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,250
Let's find out.
It also is probably cultural.

980
00:40:57,251 --> 00:40:58,700
Like,
you know,

981
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,500
when I was in Africa,
I was talking to a guy who's 50 and he

982
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:07,501
was acting like he was at the end of his
life just matter of factly,

983
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,500
just stoically.

984
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,390
He's like,
I don't have much time,

985
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:13,790
you know,
and for people in the Maasai,

986
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,570
they don't live that long.
Yeah.

987
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:20,580
Because lions around fucking lines.
If you're 50 and you haven't been eating

988
00:41:21,371 --> 00:41:21,851
yet,
you're like,

989
00:41:21,851 --> 00:41:26,350
Holy Shit.
What a great run of God on the goods

990
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:29,200
have smiled upon me.
I will continue.

991
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:33,170
Cecil has not taken my life.
Says the US,

992
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,950
uh,
March of 2016 said for the first time in

993
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:40,490
human history,
I guess people who are 65 and older will

994
00:41:40,491 --> 00:41:44,180
surpass those under five.
So there'll be more people that are

995
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:47,150
older than there are that our young
people are staying alive.

996
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,130
But um,
are they last longer?

997
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,500
Uh,
so would you know what I'm saying?

998
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,573
No,
no,

999
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,920
no.
They're not living longer to like 100

1000
00:41:54,921 --> 00:41:56,960
years old,
but there's more people that are alive

1001
00:41:56,961 --> 00:42:00,710
that are 65.
So it's like people are staying alive,

1002
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,240
but are they living longer?

1003
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,830
Like what is the long age that people
live like if you don't die of something,

1004
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,080
if you just die of old age,
what is that number?

1005
00:42:09,081 --> 00:42:11,060
And has that number moved?
Yeah,

1006
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:15,290
I think that number one,
that we just fixate on that one.

1007
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:17,400
Do I die?
It's heavy man.

1008
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:21,500
The man you ever watched Netflix and you
accidentally hit the remote and you see

1009
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,720
it like there's a 48 minutes left and
you're like,

1010
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:24,920
fuck,
now I know.

1011
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,110
Yes.
I could have just been locked into this

1012
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:30,520
movie enjoying to what it is now.
10.

1013
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:31,670
Okay.
Forty eight minutes.

1014
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,550
No,
I kind of have to pay.

1015
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,920
Should I hold it?
Should I pause?

1016
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,190
And sometimes you feel shitty about
yourself.

1017
00:42:37,191 --> 00:42:38,270
When you check,
you're like,

1018
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,550
I'm really enjoying this.
Why do I have to know?

1019
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,640
Because we're retarded.
I feel bad sometimes if I check my phone

1020
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:46,730
and there's nothing on it.

1021
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,160
Like why did I even do that?
Yeah,

1022
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,770
I got it.
Like if you just obsessively like look

1023
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:56,771
at your phone and see if you got a text.
Why it's the worst thing is such a,

1024
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:00,620
a life suck.
It is sometimes,

1025
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:05,070
but again it's also something that just
needs to be managed because it's a main.

1026
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,300
A major connection to news was fucked
up.

1027
00:43:08,301 --> 00:43:13,040
Now I get the Time magazine alerts.
You get a New York Times alerts.

1028
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:15,980
I don't.
I don't have the alerts.

1029
00:43:15,981 --> 00:43:20,420
I'll have the swipe left and see it.
I have alerts for a certain breaking

1030
00:43:20,421 --> 00:43:24,290
news things and four days it was just
trump.

1031
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:27,910
Yeah.
So every time I followed a fibrate I

1032
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:30,290
take a deep breath.
Please don't tell me what were at war.

1033
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:33,260
Like look at my phone.
Please don't tell him he dropped a nuke.

1034
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:37,070
Please don't tell me some shit has gone
down every day.

1035
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:42,050
It's a new Russia shit every day it was.
It was so rapid fire like those last two

1036
00:43:42,051 --> 00:43:44,720
weeks before he took off on his
vacation.

1037
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,290
Or is his world tour?
Well,

1038
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,780
you know,
it was nonstop.

1039
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:52,490
There's something that was just revealed
that is really interesting that James

1040
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:57,490
Comey has said that he ended the Hillary
Clinton investigation early because

1041
00:43:58,311 --> 00:44:01,700
there was some evidence that was
introduced against her that was clearly

1042
00:44:01,701 --> 00:44:06,050
counterfeit and from Russia and so he
didn't want that evidence to leak.

1043
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:06,890
Excuse me.
That.

1044
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,630
How crazy is that?
I know.

1045
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:09,860
Well,
that's what I heard.

1046
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,220
I heard some congressmen on face the
nation say that.

1047
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:15,960
He said,
this is why this is what is going to

1048
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:18,410
getting gigs.
Get scary about all these leaks and

1049
00:44:18,411 --> 00:44:19,244
stuff.
He goes,

1050
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,270
they're taking the information from the
emails,

1051
00:44:23,271 --> 00:44:24,860
from people say like,
you know,

1052
00:44:24,861 --> 00:44:28,700
the emails from the DNC or whatever and
they're leaving 99 percent of it

1053
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:29,780
perfect.

1054
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:34,590
And they put just one little line in
that says something that's heinous or

1055
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:38,550
says something about somebody doing
something toward or something and they

1056
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:42,330
put that out [inaudible] that's more
dangerous than just in the old days.

1057
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:45,600
You just try and like launch some big
story now that just bury this one little

1058
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:49,980
item in this huge dump of information.
How do you sift through that?

1059
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,210
How do you need something and it's been
leaked to Wiki leaks.

1060
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:57,290
How do they know that it hasn't been
altered exactly.

1061
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,460
Is that something that they do checks
on?

1062
00:44:59,461 --> 00:45:01,570
Do you know?
Find that that's what the comey thing.

1063
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,270
It's like,
but it took a long time,

1064
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,580
you know,
in the initial dump it was like they

1065
00:45:05,581 --> 00:45:09,270
just go through it and what's this.
But it takes a long time to sift through

1066
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:11,580
it and see if that's really a true story
or not.

1067
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,070
Because that is like bubble gum right
now.

1068
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:15,750
Yeah,
I mean that's crazy.

1069
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:20,220
That would be an amazing feat if they
could verify 100 percent the veracity of

1070
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:23,850
these emails that are being leaked,
they probably verify the sources.

1071
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,460
Yeah.
But whether or not they could verify

1072
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,320
that this hasn't been altered in any
way.

1073
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:30,720
I don't know.
Maybe we just don't understand the

1074
00:45:30,721 --> 00:45:32,310
technology.
Maybe they can do that.

1075
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,950
They'll probably get there.
I mean they've got to be working on it.

1076
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:37,590
What the fuck that.
That's my whole philosophy with

1077
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:40,350
everything in life right now is
someone's working on that.

1078
00:45:40,351 --> 00:45:41,720
Right?
Well,

1079
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:44,730
it is so crazy as to go.
Someone's working on that.

1080
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,950
Will they have.
They have been working on that,

1081
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,260
trying to figure out a way to use it for
fuel.

1082
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:51,270
That would be cool.
They think they can do it too.

1083
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:52,920
They think we're,
you know,

1084
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,580
who knows how long away from using all
of our nuclear waste as fuel.

1085
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:59,250
Who were like a,
I don't know,

1086
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,260
a rocket ship.
I don't know.

1087
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:04,120
They were talking about using,
making batteries with it.

1088
00:46:04,121 --> 00:46:07,380
A diamonds.
Remember that they were talking about

1089
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:12,381
using nuclear radiation from nuclear
waste to charge diamonds as batteries at

1090
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,300
some star trek stuff.
I know it sounds like where you have

1091
00:46:18,301 --> 00:46:20,850
like this one little orb of stuff in the
pirates.

1092
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:24,920
I needed second Jamie a standby.
Right now.

1093
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:27,530
It seems like they can't,
like,

1094
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:30,600
they can't actually confirm authenticity
of the stuff they're getting.

1095
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:31,940
They can't.
Oh,

1096
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:35,070
if the email wiki leaks.
So when wikileaks gets an email they

1097
00:46:35,071 --> 00:46:38,080
can't necessarily guarantee the
veracity,

1098
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:41,190
confirm it,
but then they did at some point like at

1099
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,620
the hip they couldn't with the hillary
stuff in the beginning,

1100
00:46:43,621 --> 00:46:48,621
but at a certain like now companies will
call me saying that one thing seemed to

1101
00:46:48,991 --> 00:46:53,140
be a counterfeit.
So one thing being counted for his like,

1102
00:46:53,141 --> 00:46:54,690
okay,
how do you know?

1103
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,910
Like they're not gonna release how they
know yet.

1104
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:58,590
Right.
There's,

1105
00:46:58,591 --> 00:47:02,400
there's a whole crazy constant
information going to go on with him and

1106
00:47:02,401 --> 00:47:05,730
this and it gets trapped.
Yeah,

1107
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:06,931
it's.
Yeah,

1108
00:47:06,931 --> 00:47:08,280
it's,
it's big stuff.

1109
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,770
It's weird time stuff.
It's weird.

1110
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:14,280
I don't know how weird it is.
I mean I really feel like.

1111
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:19,080
I feel like trump was running.
He didn't know what he's going to win.

1112
00:47:19,081 --> 00:47:20,840
They were just like,
you know,

1113
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,500
there was still,
he's still a businessman.

1114
00:47:22,501 --> 00:47:24,720
They're dealing with Russia and they're
doing with all this stuff.

1115
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:28,650
They weren't thinking like politicians
like this might look bad one day.

1116
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:31,600
Then holy shit,
he gets through in the momentum carries

1117
00:47:31,601 --> 00:47:34,330
and now he's the guy now it's like,
oh,

1118
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:38,520
so manafort probably shouldn't have
promise made that deal with them in the,

1119
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,360
you know,
what me and like all this other.

1120
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,970
He kind of got caught up because he just
wasn't.

1121
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,720
He was a businessman.
He was doing that stuff,

1122
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:48,520
but he definitely wanted to.
When you know,

1123
00:47:48,521 --> 00:47:51,230
you don't think he expected to win.
I don't think he expected it to it.

1124
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:52,780
Now he's still talking about it.
Like,

1125
00:47:52,781 --> 00:47:55,060
Holy Shit,
I won.

1126
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,700
He says that every,
every time you ask him a question,

1127
00:47:57,701 --> 00:47:59,620
you'd be like,
so what do you think about palm trees?

1128
00:47:59,621 --> 00:48:01,060
Should we save those?
I don't know,

1129
00:48:01,061 --> 00:48:02,980
but you know,
it's really hard for a Republican to win

1130
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:04,720
the electoral college,
but I did it.

1131
00:48:04,721 --> 00:48:07,090
Did you see the map?
I just put up a map in my office and

1132
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,450
doesn't that just because he likes to
congratulate himself partially,

1133
00:48:10,451 --> 00:48:13,010
but he's also a little in awe.
Like Paul,

1134
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:17,270
I don't see it that way now.
I see him as extremely self

1135
00:48:17,271 --> 00:48:21,790
congratulatory part of his whole Shtick,
like when he talks about a television

1136
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:22,431
show,
say,

1137
00:48:22,431 --> 00:48:24,100
oh,
it's number one because he watches it.

1138
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:25,600
Right.
All the rating.

1139
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:30,310
You seem shoved the guy out of the way.
What the fuck was that about?

1140
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:33,940
He's out of the way and then straighten
his jacket,

1141
00:48:33,941 --> 00:48:36,520
like a guy in a movie and when he pushed
him either way he gritted his teeth,

1142
00:48:36,521 --> 00:48:37,810
like get the fuck out of here.

1143
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:44,380
So that's so weird.
Who is the guy who pushed out of the

1144
00:48:44,381 --> 00:48:45,430
way?
He's the.

1145
00:48:45,431 --> 00:48:49,120
I'm the leader of Montenegro who's just
coming into the European Union.

1146
00:48:49,121 --> 00:48:51,160
So he's there like,
this is my first time with all the,

1147
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,580
with the whole EU.
This is my first time being here and

1148
00:48:54,581 --> 00:48:57,280
they're coming up for a photo and he
shut trumps,

1149
00:48:57,281 --> 00:49:01,020
shoves him out of the way and then
straight to this thing like I'm all

1150
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,660
right.
Photos,

1151
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:07,820
the glowing,
glowing or the counter terrorism globe

1152
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,980
kind of find that you see in the photo
from the other angle,

1153
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,660
like what shows what they're looking at,
like all the desks and the crazy cli.

1154
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:18,910
No,
it's the fucking pictures.

1155
00:49:18,911 --> 00:49:21,450
Preposterous.
That's everything that every conspiracy

1156
00:49:21,451 --> 00:49:25,390
go back everything.
Every conspiracy theorists is fucking

1157
00:49:25,391 --> 00:49:26,550
terrified of.
You're right.

1158
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:31,540
There's a dude behind him who's dressed
in traditional Arab garb.

1159
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:33,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

1160
00:49:33,451 --> 00:49:35,440
The Saudi guy was probably worth a
trillion dollars.

1161
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,180
He touching the globe.
The other guy.

1162
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:40,420
Where's he from?
With his perfect suit and his Iranian

1163
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,740
face.
Right.

1164
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,660
He looks like a Middle Eastern gentlemen
also touching that globe than trump with

1165
00:49:46,661 --> 00:49:51,220
his expensive suit on his crazy hair.
He's touching the light coming up from

1166
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:54,370
underneath like a scary camp.
A fucking story man.

1167
00:49:54,371 --> 00:49:57,940
As a movie touch.
They're holding onto a globe at the same

1168
00:49:57,941 --> 00:49:59,830
time and it's glowing.
It's so weird.

1169
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,710
Comic Book Right now.
It really is to comic book.

1170
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:06,640
This is a scene in star wars.
What the fuck is that?

1171
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,100
That's so crazy.
Why do that?

1172
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:12,490
Do you think Obama would hold onto that
globe about would be like,

1173
00:50:12,491 --> 00:50:13,480
hold on.
What are we doing?

1174
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,430
The globe glowing.
Okay.

1175
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:19,960
What does that represent?
I don't think we're gonna pass on the

1176
00:50:19,961 --> 00:50:20,910
globe.
Why is it?

1177
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,980
Why is it glowing?
Raving explanation for this.

1178
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:25,990
Exactly.
Can we take this?

1179
00:50:25,991 --> 00:50:26,980
Uh,
let's take a picture.

1180
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,160
The Fountain and Steph.
Fuck.

1181
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,280
Just all of it.
This is so hard.

1182
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:34,310
It's so a.
it's a big oil grab.

1183
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:37,030
Now I understand why dudes are out there
with the fucking metal detector.

1184
00:50:37,031 --> 00:50:40,530
Man's simplify life.
Just looking for shiny rocks.

1185
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,980
Joe and shit.
I'm telling you,

1186
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:48,190
this bread obsession of mine is if
things are going well,

1187
00:50:48,441 --> 00:50:52,250
I'm probably not making as much bread,
but to just go in simply and just be

1188
00:50:52,251 --> 00:50:56,210
making bread with the news off and just
put on some Bob Marley and just go and

1189
00:50:56,211 --> 00:50:58,760
make bread and give it to my friends and
family.

1190
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:03,170
It's a calming thing in these chaotic
times and I'm not,

1191
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:05,000
you know,
it's Corny,

1192
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:09,140
but I'm not trying to be corny,
but I really believe that back to basic.

1193
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,680
It seems like people are just like,
let's just simplify things.

1194
00:51:12,681 --> 00:51:15,290
This is out of whack.
Totally.

1195
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,430
Let me just.

1196
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:18,730
Well,
bread is a task right now.

1197
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,960
You've got your ingredients,
you know what to do,

1198
00:51:20,961 --> 00:51:22,730
and if you do all the things that you're
supposed to do,

1199
00:51:22,731 --> 00:51:25,590
it'll come out this delicious,
amazing food that you can eat.

1200
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,070
Yeah,
and yet it's elusive.

1201
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:29,680
It's you have to attend to it and it's a
craft.

1202
00:51:29,681 --> 00:51:30,514
Yeah.
Right.

1203
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,190
Right.

1204
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:34,010
So this task,
it becomes this thing that your mind is

1205
00:51:34,011 --> 00:51:38,210
fixated on and you can fill your
consciousness with the nuances of this

1206
00:51:38,211 --> 00:51:40,670
task and not thinking about all the
bullshit,

1207
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,740
like these fucking Weirdos grabbing
globes.

1208
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:43,910
Right.
Exactly.

1209
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:45,960
Makes Shit Weird.
Oil deals all over.

1210
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:48,410
The other question that we were asking
about when we were trying,

1211
00:51:48,411 --> 00:51:50,410
I was trying to double Jamie Montenegro.

1212
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:51,160
Well,
the death,

1213
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,450
the average death.
Oh yeah.

1214
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,100
Oh yeah.
That didn't really get to yet.

1215
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:58,600
70 eight point eight is what it.
It hasn't changed from 78 point eight

1216
00:51:58,601 --> 00:51:59,434
for men.
Yeah,

1217
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,470
but I think that's still based off of
that infant mortality thing added into

1218
00:52:02,471 --> 00:52:05,490
it.
That's always added into it just like

1219
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,840
right out of like a James Bond.
Totally.

1220
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:10,000
This is like x man.
It's like star wars,

1221
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:13,570
like you expect darth vader to like be
at the end of that and the guy comes in

1222
00:52:13,571 --> 00:52:15,820
after his to give her the report on what
happened

1223
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:19,400
seriously though,
could you imagine being trump a guy who

1224
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:22,160
used to host a reality show on NBC?
Yeah.

1225
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:23,980
He's a successful businessman.
You know,

1226
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:28,310
he's a well known guy,
but I mean how much of that is a ramp up

1227
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:32,210
between you or I or a lot of people that
we know that are famous,

1228
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:36,500
like how much of it like Jerry Seinfeld
is Donald Trump a ramp up in popularity

1229
00:52:36,501 --> 00:52:40,700
over Jerry Seinfeld.
I guess he is now that he's president,

1230
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:44,930
but when Jerry was on TV and Traumas,
they're kind of commensurate.

1231
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,350
You could see like Jerry Seinfeld being
president as well.

1232
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:50,720
I sure Ronald Reagan go back to that
original picture that we were just

1233
00:52:50,721 --> 00:52:53,720
looking at.
Just a couple of frames go now go and

1234
00:52:53,721 --> 00:52:57,170
think of a guy like this.
Go full screen on this fucking thing.

1235
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:02,000
Imagine Jerry Seinfeld and all of a
sudden Seinfeld gets invited to this

1236
00:53:02,001 --> 00:53:07,001
league of nations thing.
It looks like a superhero comic book

1237
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,170
scene in one of those movies.
I mean,

1238
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:13,670
there's a goddamn picture of the earth.
That's a light that's on the wall.

1239
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,510
All the light on the floor is blue.
There's little spotlights everywhere.

1240
00:53:17,511 --> 00:53:21,350
It's all freaky and clean and perfect.
There's these little screens in front of

1241
00:53:21,351 --> 00:53:22,310
every chair.
Like,

1242
00:53:22,311 --> 00:53:24,890
what the fuck is this?
This is where all the world's decisions

1243
00:53:24,891 --> 00:53:25,770
get made.
Yeah.

1244
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,130
It looks

1245
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:26,700
like the,
uh,

1246
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:30,000
what's the Peter Sellers movie will make
with the bottom of the strange.

1247
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,980
It looks like that's just strange.
It looks like.

1248
00:53:31,981 --> 00:53:33,410
Exactly.
Well,

1249
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:34,244
just,
I mean,

1250
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,470
why would we expect them to make more
sense than us?

1251
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,520
That's the thing about world leaders,
like they're just people and they're

1252
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:45,150
people that have an extraordinary amount
of power with not nearly as much

1253
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,280
oversight.
Right?

1254
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:48,390
In most countries.
Right.

1255
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:51,150
And most of these Middle Eastern
countries and most of these,

1256
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:52,800
I mean,
they don't really have to fucking tell

1257
00:53:52,801 --> 00:53:54,690
people what they're doing.
They do whatever the hell they want.

1258
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,390
Yeah,
for sure.

1259
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:58,130
A lot of these places that we have
relationships with,

1260
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:01,330
if crazy human rights violations,
I mean you get,

1261
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:06,720
you have to deal with good and bad.
You can't really have a look at that

1262
00:54:06,871 --> 00:54:09,210
man.
Imagine someone like Seinfeld there.

1263
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,810
Imagine if he won.
Like what if Seinfeld became president

1264
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,590
and like,
what is this globe?

1265
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,460
What are we doing with this thing on the
wall?

1266
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:20,370
I can't find my translator.

1267
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:26,010
Trump is he's.
I mean,

1268
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:29,220
we always think of like politicians the
same way.

1269
00:54:29,221 --> 00:54:31,500
I used to think about celebrities before
I met a few of them.

1270
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:33,500
Yeah.
When you go,

1271
00:54:33,501 --> 00:54:34,410
oh,
let's just a dude.

1272
00:54:34,411 --> 00:54:35,670
He's just a dude,
right?

1273
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:36,690
He's just a guy.
Yeah.

1274
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:39,960
Just a guy just happened to be there to
become famous.

1275
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:40,980
Yeah.
Well,

1276
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:43,380
I think that's kind of the same way with
politicians.

1277
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:46,020
We've always thought of people.
That's one of the reasons why we've

1278
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:49,380
almost like allowed them a certain
amount of leeway when it comes to

1279
00:54:49,381 --> 00:54:53,430
insincerity and you know,
getting caught in corruption and lies

1280
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:55,920
with.
There's a certain amount will like she's

1281
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:57,930
a politician,
he's a senator.

1282
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,390
Just what they do.
You let it slide a little bit of it

1283
00:55:00,391 --> 00:55:02,940
slide,
but if it was like a friend that was

1284
00:55:02,941 --> 00:55:04,950
doing that,
you'd have like serious problems with

1285
00:55:04,951 --> 00:55:05,784
them.
Yeah.

1286
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:06,623
You know?
Yeah.

1287
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:07,800
But look,
it's.

1288
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:11,730
Things have to be a little dirty because
you're dealing with everybody.

1289
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:13,560
You know,
you're dealing with everybody.

1290
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:15,540
There's so many interests.
You got to.

1291
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,970
That's what a politician is.
It's a compromise.

1292
00:55:17,971 --> 00:55:20,310
It's playing both sides of trying to get
stuff done.

1293
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,080
You know,
I think we've gone to.

1294
00:55:22,081 --> 00:55:27,081
This is absurd point of
misinterpreting.

1295
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:29,760
Good for flawless.
You know what I mean?

1296
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,870
There could be good people who have a
lot of dirty stuff going on.

1297
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:38,510
No one's flawless.
The idea that based on the Internet,

1298
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,490
we're able to get all information on
everybody all the time.

1299
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,910
We can't hold people to a standard of
being flawless.

1300
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:48,540
It doesn't exist,
but I think you can be good while still

1301
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:51,720
making some.
You know you can.

1302
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:55,440
If you set that parameter,
that bar,

1303
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:58,140
you're never going to have people that
are good enough.

1304
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:00,000
Yeah,
and you're going to have these Weirdos

1305
00:56:00,001 --> 00:56:03,420
that have insane egos because those are
the only ones that are willing to take

1306
00:56:03,421 --> 00:56:06,450
the punishment of being criticized the
way trump's taking it right now,

1307
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:08,371
but he's,
you know,

1308
00:56:08,371 --> 00:56:10,440
he's taking it away that no one's ever
taken it before.

1309
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,270
You could say he deserves it.
I'm not saying that I'm not,

1310
00:56:13,271 --> 00:56:14,880
I'm not making a judgment call.
I'm saying,

1311
00:56:14,881 --> 00:56:17,460
well,
it is absolutely fascinating the way the

1312
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:22,320
media and the way people online are
treating this president of the United

1313
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,500
States,
it may be justified.

1314
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:24,070
I'm not,
I'm not

1315
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:27,100
arguing that it's not.
What I'm saying though is it's a very

1316
00:56:27,101 --> 00:56:31,210
unique moment in time where you see so
many people attacking the president.

1317
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:32,770
Well,
it's such a rush.

1318
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,660
I mean,
you know,

1319
00:56:34,661 --> 00:56:38,050
you could say I was having a discussion
with my teenage daughter about

1320
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:42,880
navigating online stuff and seeing what
people are doing and it's almost like

1321
00:56:42,881 --> 00:56:45,670
the president is going through the same
thing that you're going through as a

1322
00:56:45,671 --> 00:56:48,850
comedian that teenage girls are going
through.

1323
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:54,640
This is a flood of information and
access and attacks and praise and

1324
00:56:54,641 --> 00:56:57,370
everything from everybody all the time,
24 hours a day.

1325
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,750
So the same way we have to navigate,
you know,

1326
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:03,400
when haters and all that kind of stuff.
The same way kids do.

1327
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:08,640
The president has to deal with a flood
that's never been this raging before.

1328
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:14,650
I mean it is an intense,
intense thing and it almost is like who

1329
00:57:14,651 --> 00:57:18,640
else?
But somebody built for television is

1330
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:19,830
ready for this job

1331
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,040
at this time.
Not even him,

1332
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:24,340
but what I was saying is that like
politicians were always like a thing,

1333
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,640
not like you or I,
but then all of a sudden they are thing

1334
00:57:27,641 --> 00:57:31,060
like Uri because now it's trump and he
might not be like the average person,

1335
00:57:31,061 --> 00:57:31,771
but he's like,
you are.

1336
00:57:31,771 --> 00:57:32,980
I,
you know,

1337
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,580
like I almost did a show when I was
doing the free version,

1338
00:57:36,581 --> 00:57:40,420
the new version of a fear factor.
They invited me to do it and I thought

1339
00:57:40,421 --> 00:57:42,040
about it for a while,
but I would have had to live in New York

1340
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,900
for a few months and I was like,
I don't want to do that.

1341
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:45,580
The new thing that's coming out,
the old.

1342
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,211
Oh,
the old one,

1343
00:57:46,211 --> 00:57:50,020
like in 2011 or whatever the hell it was
when we redid it again.

1344
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,600
Yep.
But I mean,

1345
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:55,600
he would've been with him.
I could have been hanging out with him.

1346
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:57,370
You know what I'm saying?
On the marriage riff.

1347
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:58,070
Yeah.

1348
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:00,980
I sat with him on the marriage trip.
We stage.

1349
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:04,280
The first thing he said when he walked
into the dressing room was,

1350
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:05,690
we're going to get great ratings
tonight.

1351
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:09,950
We're going to get great ratings.
He was so focused and he was impressive.

1352
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,920
He was tall.
He was a dominant guy in the room.

1353
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,900
And uh,
yeah.

1354
00:58:14,901 --> 00:58:18,020
And then I'm sitting on stage with him
and we were all talking about married

1355
00:58:18,021 --> 00:58:18,880
couples.
It was like a,

1356
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:20,870
like a,
you would show real people and then

1357
00:58:20,871 --> 00:58:24,380
you'd discuss their marital problems and
the celebrities would weigh in and the

1358
00:58:24,381 --> 00:58:28,790
whole time he's next to me and the whole
time he's making jokes about the girl's

1359
00:58:28,791 --> 00:58:30,410
breasts.
He's just like,

1360
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,860
you know,
nothing really funny.

1361
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:35,030
He was being funny and he would be like,
well,

1362
00:58:35,031 --> 00:58:37,160
you know,
she's got something going for and then

1363
00:58:37,161 --> 00:58:41,060
he would look at me and give me a little
wink on the side and it wasn't for the

1364
00:58:41,061 --> 00:58:42,650
cameras,
it's just for me and it felt kind of

1365
00:58:42,651 --> 00:58:43,484
creepy,

1366
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:47,070
but it's kind of like he was just a
dude.

1367
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:52,160
He's sitting there with me in equal
footing and now he's the president of

1368
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:55,140
the United States.
Think about how powerful.

1369
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:58,620
There's not one human being,
I don't believe in the country that

1370
00:58:58,621 --> 00:59:00,720
doesn't have the word trump go through
their brain.

1371
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:02,070
Whether they say it out loud or not

1372
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,170
all day,
all day,

1373
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:06,440
all day,
or at least a couple times a day.

1374
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,930
You know what I mean?
It's so insane.

1375
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,970
Yeah.
There's initial disbelief.

1376
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,660
Then there was an aftershock and now
there is a waiting for the next shoe to

1377
00:59:14,661 --> 00:59:16,010
drop.
That's what every day.

1378
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19,160
Everybody's just sitting around waiting
for the newest scandal every day,

1379
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:22,150
waiting for the impeachment,
waiting for the lawsuits,

1380
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,440
waiting for the jail.
You just want calm.

1381
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,980
You know?
You have a great joke when you.

1382
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:32,690
You've been working on about a.
This isn't a job for one person,

1383
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:33,850
right?
This,

1384
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:36,320
she really should be a committee of
people running this country.

1385
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:39,170
It's too much for somebody and I love
that joke,

1386
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:44,210
but I think that what his job is what
that president's job is more than

1387
00:59:44,211 --> 00:59:48,280
anything is to just lead people.
You Ha.

1388
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:51,110
He has power.
All those people in those positions,

1389
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:56,450
they have power and what they say and
what they do affects people.

1390
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:59,790
Not Policy.
Just the Reagan ask her all,

1391
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,430
carry themselves,
carry themselves,

1392
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,960
make you feel good about the direction.
All that,

1393
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:09,040
and right now everybody's filled with
anxiety because he's not doing that part

1394
01:00:11,751 --> 01:00:14,570
of the job well,
but he still goes on twitter and calls

1395
01:00:14,571 --> 01:00:16,730
people losers and you're like,
wait.

1396
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,250
It's like it's like a kid.
Like you were saying before,

1397
01:00:19,251 --> 01:00:23,270
it's like a kid hearing,
like having a be batshit crazy in the

1398
01:00:23,271 --> 01:00:24,830
house.
The house is going to be crazy.

1399
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:29,720
If Dad is shooting heroin and he's
laying on the couch is covered and

1400
01:00:29,721 --> 01:00:33,860
cheetos and he's yelling at the wife,
the whole house is going to be freaked

1401
01:00:33,861 --> 01:00:35,780
out.
That's what's going on.

1402
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:39,680
But is that the price that we have to
pay to realize that our system is

1403
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:43,400
ridiculous?
Is there any the throwing the card table

1404
01:00:43,401 --> 01:00:45,710
up and is there any value in that
thought?

1405
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:48,290
I mean other than the real issues with
the environment,

1406
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:51,200
the rolling back,
the standards on the EPA and all the

1407
01:00:51,201 --> 01:00:55,040
different things he's doing to free
people out in the code access pipeline,

1408
01:00:55,041 --> 01:00:57,620
which I don't understand enough to know
whether or not they were going to

1409
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,760
restart that.

1410
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,500
Anyway,
I know Obama shut it down.

1411
01:01:00,501 --> 01:01:02,180
Right.
And then trump brought it back up again.

1412
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:04,850
Who knows if they had made some sort of
an agreement.

1413
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:06,680
Yeah.
Who knows how that works.

1414
01:01:06,681 --> 01:01:08,900
Who knows if they,
you know how that business is very

1415
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:10,250
dirty.
It's very dirty.

1416
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,150
Totally.
You know,

1417
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:12,060
I mean it's,
you know,

1418
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:15,140
you could make a case that all of this
is a big oil grab,

1419
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:16,003
right?
I mean,

1420
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,590
well the Dakota pipeline stuff was
terrifying.

1421
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:22,220
Dakota pipeline stuff.
The head of the EPA is an oil guy.

1422
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:26,450
The secretary of state is an Exxon guy.
The people he favors more than our

1423
01:01:26,451 --> 01:01:29,570
Russian,
more than our European allies are Saudi

1424
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:33,350
Arabia and Russia,
big oil business partners.

1425
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,890
You could say this is just business as
you.

1426
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,530
And it's right.
And the thing is,

1427
01:01:39,531 --> 01:01:42,710
and this is what's so complex about it,
it's okay.

1428
01:01:42,711 --> 01:01:45,830
So maybe it's an oil grabbing,
the he's getting his friends rich,

1429
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:50,570
but oil also is so much more than just
what's coming out of our cars.

1430
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:53,360
We are so deep in oil,
it's,

1431
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:55,010
it's,
it's not.

1432
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:59,270
I'm my whole.
My main thing is the planet and its

1433
01:01:59,271 --> 01:02:03,290
beauty and trying to sustain it.
I'm a complete believer in climate

1434
01:02:03,291 --> 01:02:08,291
change and all of that.
But to naive Lee say we can just shut

1435
01:02:08,781 --> 01:02:11,480
down oil and be like,
we can all just move along.

1436
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:14,630
It's so much deeper than that.
My nephew is a,

1437
01:02:14,631 --> 01:02:17,450
uh,
went to just graduated from school and

1438
01:02:17,451 --> 01:02:21,480
he's big agro guy,
like that's what he wants to do with his

1439
01:02:21,481 --> 01:02:26,481
whole life.
His revelation was that oil and food are

1440
01:02:26,551 --> 01:02:29,820
so interconnected.
All of the fertilizer that's creating

1441
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,510
all of the food that we're eating every
day is oil based.

1442
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:36,660
He said,
so you're trying to separate,

1443
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:38,700
uh,
emissions and all this stuff,

1444
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:41,850
but just the food that we eat is so tied
to oil.

1445
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:45,810
We need oil,
so I don't know how you fix that and how

1446
01:02:45,811 --> 01:02:48,510
you try and make good policy about it.

1447
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:50,023
Well,
um,

1448
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:55,270
there are alternatives to fossil fuel
based oils that they used to make

1449
01:02:56,451 --> 01:03:00,230
plastics and know that I know they can
even make class to get a hamp.

1450
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,530
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1451
01:03:01,531 --> 01:03:04,760
And it's biodegradable and they've just
started to make these biodegradable,

1452
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,480
um,
natural fiber plastic bags that are not.

1453
01:03:08,481 --> 01:03:10,370
They're made out of like a plant
plastic.

1454
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:12,060
Yeah.
Like in the supermarket.

1455
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:14,120
And you put your vegetables in those.
Yeah,

1456
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:15,430
they're supposed to.
They will,

1457
01:03:15,431 --> 01:03:16,340
they will,
they will.

1458
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:20,360
When they go into the environment,
they all actually biodegrade.

1459
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:24,260
They will become dirt again,
post like a regular plastic bag,

1460
01:03:24,261 --> 01:03:26,850
which probably takes like a fucking
$100,000 company here.

1461
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:29,780
Then birds,
he didn't die and choke on the plastic

1462
01:03:29,781 --> 01:03:32,300
caps,
but apparently you can make plastic out

1463
01:03:32,301 --> 01:03:36,470
of hemp and it's super easy to make in
terms of like,

1464
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,740
it regrows itself very quickly.
I'm like,

1465
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,140
if you have a forest and you're trying
to make paper,

1466
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:42,971
like you know,
you're,

1467
01:03:42,971 --> 01:03:44,570
you're trying to make paper out of a,
you know,

1468
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:46,760
you have a forest,
timber that you chopped down

1469
01:03:46,761 --> 01:03:49,820
specifically for paper to regrow it to
the point where he could grow paper

1470
01:03:49,821 --> 01:03:50,750
again,
can take years.

1471
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:52,310
I don't know how many years,
but many years.

1472
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:55,400
Whereas hemp regrows itself every year.
Really.

1473
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:56,383
Every year.
Yeah.

1474
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:57,710
What is this right here?
Jen?

1475
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:02,180
Edible plastic.
Made out of milk protein for food

1476
01:04:02,181 --> 01:04:03,700
packaging.
Holy Cow.

1477
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:06,810
Not Vegan.
Yeah.

1478
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,590
Packaging,
like dairy products and whatnot with it

1479
01:04:09,591 --> 01:04:11,400
at least is what the video shows.
But uh,

1480
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:12,860
that's fascinating.
Video.

1481
01:04:12,861 --> 01:04:13,880
Yeah.
Like two days ago.

1482
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:17,000
Well that's certainly something that can
be worked on.

1483
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:19,600
You know,
the idea of biodegradable plastics would

1484
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:22,820
be huge.
The that's one of the scariest things is

1485
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:28,160
that we started making waste and never
had a plan to do with anything,

1486
01:04:28,190 --> 01:04:30,560
do anything with the waste,
and then it stacked up to the point

1487
01:04:30,561 --> 01:04:34,220
where we're dealing with enormous
amounts of waste being put up by human

1488
01:04:34,221 --> 01:04:36,420
beings.
Every single second I've ever seen that.

1489
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:38,980
Well,
I was in New York last week,

1490
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:44,010
just work in the comedy cellar all week
and every night I left the club just on

1491
01:04:44,201 --> 01:04:47,650
Macdougal Street,
just between third and bleaker.

1492
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:52,990
The amount of garbage that's thrown out
of these restaurants and these juice

1493
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:55,720
places and coffee places stacked

1494
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,630
just high all the way down the street.
Every single day.

1495
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:04,220
You see rats Darden in and out of him.
A tons of tons of rats.

1496
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:06,800
They're creepy.
Yeah,

1497
01:05:06,801 --> 01:05:07,790
it's.
We are.

1498
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:11,960
We are a weird creature man.
There's so many of us and we're not

1499
01:05:11,961 --> 01:05:14,480
really thinking about that.
Like you think about how many,

1500
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:17,590
like on an average day,
how many water bottles you come across

1501
01:05:17,591 --> 01:05:18,424
in La.

1502
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:20,800
She's like 10 of them here in this room.
I know.

1503
01:05:20,801 --> 01:05:23,830
I feel guilty drinking it.
I got gas this morning.

1504
01:05:23,831 --> 01:05:26,420
I threw a bunch out of my car,
I thrown into the garbage.

1505
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:30,590
That's when I got gas.
I threw it at the garbage cans of gas

1506
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:31,121
station.
I was like,

1507
01:05:31,121 --> 01:05:32,710
well,
how many fucking water bottles I have my

1508
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:35,290
car.
It's crazy how many times someone had to

1509
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:38,170
make plastic.
How many bottles of plastic are being

1510
01:05:38,171 --> 01:05:40,000
made?
And then that plastic has to be in a

1511
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:41,730
landfill somewhere or you know,
in,

1512
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,780
in the ocean.
Giant island in the ocean.

1513
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:46,420
That big plastic bottle island.
Yeah.

1514
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:47,770
Oh,
it's terrible.

1515
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:50,830
Apparently it's not quite as an island.
They call it an island,

1516
01:05:50,831 --> 01:05:52,570
but it's really just like a floating
patch.

1517
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,880
But it's disgusting.
It's horrible.

1518
01:05:54,881 --> 01:05:56,920
It's really bad.
So we're just seeking out a way to fix

1519
01:05:56,921 --> 01:05:58,720
that.
There's so many people.

1520
01:05:58,790 --> 01:05:59,920
Yeah.
Just,

1521
01:05:59,921 --> 01:06:04,921
I mean there's so many of us,
like I'm well for farm to table and like

1522
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:07,600
knowing where your meat comes from.
I get it,

1523
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:09,310
I want to do it.
I'm trying,

1524
01:06:09,311 --> 01:06:12,910
you know.
But when you think about how many people

1525
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:17,940
are looking for lunch at the same time,
all those mouths looking to feed.

1526
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:25,500
I mean you need like a Mcdonald's.
Somebody's got to feed these people.

1527
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:28,480
You know what I mean?
There's.

1528
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:30,520
There's definitely an issue.
Sure.

1529
01:06:30,521 --> 01:06:33,520
I don't know if you need a Mcdonald's,
but you need something.

1530
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:37,300
You need food and there's 20 plus
million people in this area that aren't

1531
01:06:37,301 --> 01:06:40,330
growing anything other than the
occasional pot plant.

1532
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:41,440
Right,
exactly.

1533
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:44,110
I have a friend in my kitchen.
I'm growing my own basil.

1534
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:48,160
I'm growing my own peppers.
Pepperdine,

1535
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,380
who the fuck do you know that grows
enough to live off of?

1536
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:52,230
I know you can't do it.

1537
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:54,670
You can't do it unless you live on a
farm.

1538
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,740
Nobody's growing enough food to live
off.

1539
01:06:57,010 --> 01:07:00,100
I mean not.
I mean just the people you see like on

1540
01:07:00,101 --> 01:07:01,450
the four.
Oh five.

1541
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:05,020
I mean just feed those people.
You know what it is to have like on this

1542
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:08,560
great Memorial Day weekend,
if you could have some people over and

1543
01:07:08,561 --> 01:07:11,740
have a little barbecue,
you bring 10 people over.

1544
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:13,990
You gotTa,
you gotta get some food.

1545
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:17,200
This is some serious amount of food.
You need to feed 10 people,

1546
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:21,330
billions of people and then they want to
eat again an hour.

1547
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:22,840
Yeah.
And their chips.

1548
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:25,910
Chips.
Do you have any soda?

1549
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,120
Soda?
Do you have taken dumps in your

1550
01:07:28,121 --> 01:07:30,730
bathroom?
Filling up your fucking pipes with their

1551
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:34,660
shit.
Thinking about shit is going on the

1552
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:38,170
bowl.
Chewing on a rib and taking a dump.

1553
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:40,960
Pick how much shit is going through
under the city.

1554
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,170
Every minute.
Comedy store has a bathroom.

1555
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,420
There's a new bathroom.
They just put it in.

1556
01:07:45,421 --> 01:07:47,890
Oh yeah.
So other nancy it backed up last night.

1557
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:50,650
Oh no,
they have old pipes and a new bathroom.

1558
01:07:50,651 --> 01:07:52,540
I don't know what they did replace the
pipes,

1559
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:55,970
but something went wrong and I walked by
the bathroom last night.

1560
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:57,580
I was like,
what the fuck is

1561
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:03,460
that about the smell of shit outside of
the water.

1562
01:08:03,461 --> 01:08:06,370
That is just so.
So Chris,

1563
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:09,770
back to the dog thing.
This is my.

1564
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:12,580
We were talking about our dogs like
rolling and shit and stuff.

1565
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:16,910
My cousin stuck the other day.
They had people coming to paint the

1566
01:08:16,911 --> 01:08:21,230
house and my cousin's wife told them,
hey listen,

1567
01:08:21,231 --> 01:08:23,110
you can use our bathroom.
Don't worry about.

1568
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:24,420
You know,
you don't have to go outside.

1569
01:08:24,421 --> 01:08:26,960
They just,
our bathroom is your bathroom.

1570
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:30,620
But they didn't really speak English.
They didn't really listen to her and

1571
01:08:30,621 --> 01:08:34,340
some guy took a dump in the bushes.
The dog

1572
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:38,960
rolled around and they came running
inside and she's like,

1573
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:41,180
what is?
Oh my God,

1574
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:47,020
how did you get human shit on your head?
How she knows human shit.

1575
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:48,890
It smelled different.

1576
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,820
And then they went outside and looked
and they're like,

1577
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:55,320
you guys use our bathroom.
So sorry.

1578
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:59,890
Oh my God.
Let's August.

1579
01:08:59,891 --> 01:09:04,320
So
look what I found.

1580
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:07,250
These guys are great.
Have you seen these guys?

1581
01:09:07,690 --> 01:09:12,640
They're so great.
Why does a dog want to Roland Shit?

1582
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:18,890
He doesn't know what is that?
Possesses it to think that that's a good

1583
01:09:21,321 --> 01:09:24,340
move.
Just so happy.

1584
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:26,660
Oh Man,
I guess a role in this.

1585
01:09:26,661 --> 01:09:27,690
No one's going to throw a ball.
Oh,

1586
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:29,850
rolling.
Damn well.

1587
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:31,760
Could I found.
Have you met these guys?

1588
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,520
They're awesome.
They're shit.

1589
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:39,521
Smells terrific.
Barely smeared his own shit on his face

1590
01:09:40,461 --> 01:09:42,140
during the podcast.
Why?

1591
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:44,100
I don't know.
They were talking about it.

1592
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:45,530
One of their podcasts,
they did.

1593
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:46,430
He,
uh,

1594
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:49,430
he went to the bathroom and I guess he
didn't get to do a good job of wiping.

1595
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:54,660
They've reached back and felt as but and
then I was faced like warpaint got taken

1596
01:09:56,301 --> 01:09:58,060
off of Youtube for that.
I can't find a weird.

1597
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,060
I want to follow.
Youtube would get behind that with all

1598
01:10:02,061 --> 01:10:04,630
their advertising money.
Oh,

1599
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:05,840
it's terrible.

1600
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:12,050
So fucking bro boiled his brain out
there in Thailand.

1601
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:15,140
He sat there and fucking Vietnam in the
hot sun for too long.

1602
01:10:15,141 --> 01:10:15,601
Yeah,
he,

1603
01:10:15,601 --> 01:10:17,750
he comes.
Every time he comes back he's a little

1604
01:10:17,751 --> 01:10:21,120
different.
He's living in a very unique life that

1605
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:22,320
felt good.
Good.

1606
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:24,440
God bless him.
Is he off the cell phone now?

1607
01:10:24,441 --> 01:10:27,760
Like even though he's here,
he'll chew,

1608
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:28,870
you know,
you can text him.

1609
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,550
He texts.
He is one of those flip phones that you

1610
01:10:31,551 --> 01:10:32,670
can text with.
Right.

1611
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:34,880
You know,
flip sideways and it's got like a

1612
01:10:34,881 --> 01:10:38,840
keyboard and you a text,
but you can't like say if you send him a

1613
01:10:38,841 --> 01:10:40,580
picture,
he has to forward it to his email.

1614
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:42,530
Oh good.
Because he's got to go check it on his

1615
01:10:42,531 --> 01:10:44,420
computer.
It's got to go to a library

1616
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:48,230
and they won't let him in because he's
got shit on his face.

1617
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:53,890
The Guy Shit face to face.
You get out of.

1618
01:10:56,230 --> 01:10:58,820
It's so funny.
That guy went away for four months,

1619
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:00,120
man.
Yeah,

1620
01:11:00,121 --> 01:11:02,150
I know.
Vanished for four months without talking

1621
01:11:02,151 --> 01:11:03,680
to anybody and then he shows up and it's
like,

1622
01:11:03,681 --> 01:11:05,300
all right,
it's time to tape this TV show again.

1623
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,550
Yeah.
It's not a bad move.

1624
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:08,660
Well,
I mean,

1625
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:11,120
I guarantee you he's got some crazy
stories.

1626
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:14,640
There's no way he doesn't because he's
probably out there making stories happen

1627
01:11:14,641 --> 01:11:16,860
to know knowing that he's going to need
some stories.

1628
01:11:16,861 --> 01:11:18,840
Yeah,
it's true.

1629
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:21,050
Know.
I mean this whole show is a stories.

1630
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:24,060
The stories.
It shows me the best shows on comedy

1631
01:11:24,061 --> 01:11:24,960
central.
It is,

1632
01:11:24,961 --> 01:11:27,210
it's really good.
I really hope comedy central never

1633
01:11:27,211 --> 01:11:30,450
cancelled that thing because that's one
of the best shows on comedy,

1634
01:11:30,451 --> 01:11:33,000
central standup shows.
There is.

1635
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:36,690
It really is good.
And I did it twice and uh,

1636
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:40,170
I get more hits off of that.
Then I do like stand up sets.

1637
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,160
Well,
it's just different.

1638
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:42,660
Yeah.
They just doesn't stories.

1639
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:44,190
There's,
you're talking about stories and it's

1640
01:11:44,191 --> 01:11:46,800
also different because like guys like
Henry rollins did it.

1641
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,870
Yeah.
Like he's not even necessarily.

1642
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:52,530
Comedy is great storyteller,
so he'll do the standup comedy

1643
01:11:52,531 --> 01:11:55,780
storytelling show and just tell stories
and the setting's really cool.

1644
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,570
Looks good.
Like in that Strip club.

1645
01:11:58,530 --> 01:12:02,790
It really suits chimp club off.
Outside of now I want to go there one

1646
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:06,660
day when he's not filming the show.
Just go get what it's like when you

1647
01:12:06,661 --> 01:12:10,580
really see it clearly like we're seeing
like yeah,

1648
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:11,880
side of it.
That's not real.

1649
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:13,260
No.
You're seeing like Atlantic city in the

1650
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:16,110
daytime,
it's like this is very different than

1651
01:12:16,111 --> 01:12:17,880
what,
like what happens when the sun goes

1652
01:12:17,881 --> 01:12:19,680
down.
Atlantic city in the daytime is.

1653
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:21,560
Yeah.
Is that it's true.

1654
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,700
Strip around a pole right there.
Hey,

1655
01:12:23,830 --> 01:12:25,650
put your girls in the honest fuck is
this shit.

1656
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:27,300
Yeah.
It was fun.

1657
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:30,030
When I was a kid there was no girls that
went to strip clubs.

1658
01:12:30,150 --> 01:12:31,110
None.
Zero.

1659
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:33,000
Now everybody's like,
yeah.

1660
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:40,320
It's like going to a sports bar.
It's like girls who go to cigar bars.

1661
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:42,450
Yeah.
I'm just like you guys.

1662
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:45,450
I'm one of the guys.
Right?

1663
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:47,850
Right.
That's what we're here to not be with

1664
01:12:47,851 --> 01:12:50,280
you right now to try and trying to test
your resolve.

1665
01:12:50,281 --> 01:12:52,410
Young Tom,
papa trying to calm down.

1666
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,480
They're trying to get you to come over
their side.

1667
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:56,940
Slowly but surely they turn.
You know man,

1668
01:12:56,941 --> 01:12:58,800
she's cool.
She's different from all the rest.

1669
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:00,870
How about the guy who brings his
girlfriend everywhere?

1670
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:02,520
How about that?
Brutal motherfucker.

1671
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:04,260
Gonna have fights over your house.
Hey man,

1672
01:13:04,261 --> 01:13:05,190
you want to come over?
Watch fights?

1673
01:13:05,191 --> 01:13:05,790
Yeah,
sure.

1674
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:10,110
I'm bringing cindy.
Oh you fuck you.

1675
01:13:10,111 --> 01:13:12,060
Fuck.
It's cool.

1676
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:15,130
Guys who don't even ask.
He just opened the door and you'd go

1677
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:20,260
over the house laugh and people drank in
pot.

1678
01:13:20,261 --> 01:13:25,261
Small in someone's jerking off the dog
with their foot and then she comes in.

1679
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:29,760
Are you guys ever going to grow up?
I did that once in college.

1680
01:13:29,761 --> 01:13:33,670
I came in and I was the guy who brought
the girl and walked in and you could

1681
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:38,690
just feel the hate was so thick and they
just got so silent and change the vibe

1682
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:44,240
and until you got her out of there,
there was no other way to cares.

1683
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:49,230
The Guy Comic brings his girlfriend to
everything and then expects her to be

1684
01:13:49,231 --> 01:13:53,670
able to talk on podcasts.
There's a special place in Hell reserved

1685
01:13:53,671 --> 01:13:56,750
for those gentlemen.
You know who you pussy whipped hmong

1686
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:59,420
girls are.
You get your shit together,

1687
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:02,670
get your shit together and don't you
ever do that again?

1688
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,500
Yeah.
Look,

1689
01:14:04,501 --> 01:14:05,790
you want to go to dinner?
Sure.

1690
01:14:05,791 --> 01:14:07,050
Bring her along.
You want to do it?

1691
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:09,840
Fine.
Problem is that he doesn't listen to me

1692
01:14:09,841 --> 01:14:10,674
enough.

1693
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:13,840
No,
that's so great.

1694
01:14:13,841 --> 01:14:17,410
You're here to tell me that.
That's what I want to do right now.

1695
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,830
The the same exact thing.
If we showed up for one of their 50

1696
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:24,160
shades of grey parties,
they're all wearing ball gags and

1697
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:30,070
ready to go to fucking tie each other up
with stockings and we show up.

1698
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:32,170
Oh Great.
You brought Jamie?

1699
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,360
No.
Yeah,

1700
01:14:33,370 --> 01:14:36,640
a guy going in with all girls.
You ruined the whole night for the vibe,

1701
01:14:36,641 --> 01:14:38,440
man.
Show up at a tupperware party.

1702
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,620
All of a sudden,
fuck away.

1703
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:44,140
Tom Makes Bread.
I made bread ladies to seal on this is

1704
01:14:44,141 --> 01:14:45,820
not going to be enough to keep my bread
fresh.

1705
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:49,000
Fucking
no.

1706
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:53,260
We ever see girls that are at your shows
and there's like a whole table of girls.

1707
01:14:53,261 --> 01:14:55,870
They're so free and they're so.
They're laughing,

1708
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:58,420
they're having a good time.
One guy sits at that table,

1709
01:14:58,450 --> 01:14:59,770
ruins it,
ruins it.

1710
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:01,530
Yeah,
because he's playing sexual politics

1711
01:15:01,531 --> 01:15:04,080
with at least two different girls.
Like you might have a girlfriend there,

1712
01:15:04,090 --> 01:15:07,450
but he's a little too friendly with her
friend where she's getting pissed off

1713
01:15:07,451 --> 01:15:10,420
and you complimented her dress.
Who thought she was your friend who

1714
01:15:10,421 --> 01:15:13,600
knows drugs.
You look better now say that he didn't

1715
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:21,340
just need a great test in stand by me
just in your face.

1716
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:27,010
Sometimes you just need to.
You need a break.

1717
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:30,580
You need to light a cigar and be alone.
Get out of that.

1718
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,060
Yeah.
Too much.

1719
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:34,720
It's absolutely important for any
friendship,

1720
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,210
any relationship.
Anytime.

1721
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:38,710
Two people interact with each other to
take time apart from each other.

1722
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,770
A little bit of space,
you know all the time,

1723
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:44,650
like if you're on top of each other each
and every day,

1724
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:47,620
unless you're a really unique cup of
which I have met before.

1725
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:50,140
They're out there.
They make you feel really bad about your

1726
01:15:50,141 --> 01:15:52,360
own relationship.
Do everything together and they're

1727
01:15:52,361 --> 01:15:54,350
always looking at each other laughing.
He had nowhere.

1728
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:56,050
Great.
We worked together and we play together.

1729
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:58,030
Well,
we just get along,

1730
01:15:58,031 --> 01:16:00,000
we finish each other's sentences and
all.

1731
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:02,680
They're holding hands all the time.
It does happen.

1732
01:16:02,681 --> 01:16:04,150
It does happen.
I hate them.

1733
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:05,051
Well,
you know what it is,

1734
01:16:05,051 --> 01:16:06,610
man.
It's just like they found that

1735
01:16:06,611 --> 01:16:09,610
frequency,
that unique personality frequency,

1736
01:16:09,611 --> 01:16:14,611
because oftentimes your frequency in
someone else's frequencies just off.

1737
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,690
Yeah.
And that doesn't mean you don't love

1738
01:16:16,691 --> 01:16:20,020
each other.
Like one person might be the WHO and the

1739
01:16:20,021 --> 01:16:21,770
other person is the doors,
you know,

1740
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:22,301
like,
okay,

1741
01:16:22,301 --> 01:16:23,860
we've got to figure out what we're doing
here.

1742
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:26,770
This is the uh,
we both really liked the Beatles.

1743
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:29,920
Yeah.
My only friend.

1744
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:32,560
How can you believe?

1745
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,060
Like,
no,

1746
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:37,301
no,
no.

1747
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:41,530
You're too hyper to be different.
I know what I'm doing in those two

1748
01:16:41,531 --> 01:16:45,250
people are together for 15 years,
but on his throat,

1749
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:48,910
it's really interesting when you see
people that are clawing each other's

1750
01:16:48,911 --> 01:16:50,220
throats.
Yeah.

1751
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:50,771
Yeah.
Okay.

1752
01:16:50,771 --> 01:16:53,230
That's a good question.
Who would you rather be around the

1753
01:16:53,231 --> 01:16:57,520
couple that's stabbing at each other or
the ideal couple who's making you feel

1754
01:16:57,521 --> 01:17:00,250
like your relationship isn't so great?
The ideal couple for sure.

1755
01:17:00,251 --> 01:17:01,720
I want to be around happy people.
Yeah.

1756
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:04,150
I want to be around people that are
enjoying each other's company.

1757
01:17:04,151 --> 01:17:07,480
There's nothing more frustrating than
being around to people that insult each

1758
01:17:07,481 --> 01:17:09,220
other.
Like slyly in public.

1759
01:17:09,910 --> 01:17:11,930
It's brutal.
We know a couple of apartments.

1760
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,150
Wife used to do that all the time.
Really?

1761
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:15,530
Yeah.
They say you shouldn't speak ill of the

1762
01:17:15,531 --> 01:17:17,060
dead,
but when they kill your friend and then

1763
01:17:17,061 --> 01:17:18,710
killed themselves,
I think you're allowed to talk shit.

1764
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:21,330
Absolutely.
There's no reverence in the effort of

1765
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:22,430
the day.
Had a very,

1766
01:17:22,431 --> 01:17:25,100
a combative relationship,
but she used to talk shit about him in

1767
01:17:25,101 --> 01:17:26,240
front of us.
Really?

1768
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:27,860
Yeah,
right in front of him and us.

1769
01:17:27,861 --> 01:17:30,920
It was just like she would say he was
old and she would,

1770
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:32,930
you know,
like one time she's talking about her

1771
01:17:32,931 --> 01:17:34,270
car.
There were.

1772
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:37,220
Phil was talking about a car that can
fills a car,

1773
01:17:37,221 --> 01:17:39,620
aficionados loved cars.
So we were talking about a car.

1774
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:42,260
I forget what it was,
and then she goes,

1775
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:44,870
I love pickup trucks.
I want to get a pickup truck.

1776
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,790
All my boyfriend's back home had pickup
trucks

1777
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:52,880
and you just picture and her getting
stuffed in the back of his pickup truck

1778
01:17:52,881 --> 01:17:56,990
by some fucking farmer boy.
Some dude with thick wrists,

1779
01:17:57,350 --> 01:18:02,330
a catcher's Mitt has just laying his fat
dick because he would take his pants

1780
01:18:02,331 --> 01:18:03,164
off.

1781
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:05,510
But saying that like,
I dunno,

1782
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:07,250
it's terrible.
It's just weird.

1783
01:18:07,251 --> 01:18:09,610
It was constantly like that.
She was always belittling them,

1784
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:12,650
always tearing them down.
They would have these horrible fights.

1785
01:18:12,651 --> 01:18:14,360
Man,
I never understand that.

1786
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:17,150
It's like you're together.
Like it's for the good,

1787
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:21,290
like his success is your success and yet
they'll still tear them down.

1788
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:23,930
Well,
people don't think logically know what

1789
01:18:23,931 --> 01:18:25,790
you're saying,
but that's not a logical thought.

1790
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:28,850
I mean the,
I think they just didn't get along

1791
01:18:28,851 --> 01:18:29,870
great.
You know,

1792
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:35,060
for whatever reason feel was really
fucking smart too.

1793
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:37,760
He was the coolest.
He was a really smart.

1794
01:18:37,761 --> 01:18:39,110
You're so lucky.
You got to know him.

1795
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:40,191
Yeah.
He was,

1796
01:18:40,191 --> 01:18:41,540
um,
like,

1797
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:44,390
I mean he would do things like he
learned how to be a pilot,

1798
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:48,890
so he would be on the set and during the
downtime he be reading aviation books.

1799
01:18:48,930 --> 01:18:51,020
She sit in there reading,
going through him,

1800
01:18:51,021 --> 01:18:54,560
he was the most studious guy,
disciplined with his notes.

1801
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:59,510
He would have his script and each one of
his scenes that he was in would have a

1802
01:18:59,511 --> 01:19:01,210
certain highlight,
like a,

1803
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:03,650
like a tab,
like a green tab or whatever the color

1804
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:06,110
tab was,
and then all of his scenes we'd be

1805
01:19:06,111 --> 01:19:08,180
highlighted,
he'd have notes beside them,

1806
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:11,720
specific parts of the scene where he
wanted to do something different or

1807
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:16,310
questioned his intent or go in and he
would just,

1808
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:20,170
every time he would nail it,
every time he would never use the

1809
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:24,410
incredibly rare time where he would
crack up during the filming.

1810
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:26,210
You know,
I'm just having fun.

1811
01:19:26,211 --> 01:19:28,460
If it was never like you fucked up,
but he never fucked up.

1812
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:30,830
Right.
I mean everybody fucks up and laughs

1813
01:19:30,831 --> 01:19:32,510
when you're not supposed to laugh
because it's funny.

1814
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:34,910
But he was on his game.
He was so professional,

1815
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:37,100
but he was a very,
very,

1816
01:19:37,101 --> 01:19:38,510
very intelligent man.

1817
01:19:38,530 --> 01:19:39,770
But he was an artist too,
right?

1818
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:42,020
Yeah.
Sydney started out like designing like

1819
01:19:42,021 --> 01:19:44,270
design album covers for bands.
Yeah.

1820
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:47,930
Before he was ever even on snl.
He was also one of the greatest for pee

1821
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:49,760
wee's playhouse.
Right.

1822
01:19:49,930 --> 01:19:53,720
And he was on pbs but he was on peewee's
playhouse and I think he wrote the first

1823
01:19:53,721 --> 01:19:56,090
movie because he think he wrote peewee's
big adventure.

1824
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:58,550
It's one of the writers,
but a great.

1825
01:19:58,610 --> 01:20:00,590
That's amazing.
So you got to hang with them a lot.

1826
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,810
You guys are hanging out at the time.
He took me up in his plane.

1827
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:03,680
He did,
yeah.

1828
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,690
It was crazy because I want to buy a
house.

1829
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:07,800
And um,
he was suggesting all these different

1830
01:20:07,801 --> 01:20:08,634
areas

1831
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:09,990
and they said,
what do you like?

1832
01:20:09,991 --> 01:20:11,550
I said,
I just like quiet.

1833
01:20:11,610 --> 01:20:13,710
I like peace.
I like to see things that are pretty

1834
01:20:13,711 --> 01:20:15,540
like nature.
And he's like,

1835
01:20:15,541 --> 01:20:17,840
okay,
because I think there's an area like

1836
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:20,730
right around like thousand oaks area.
I want you to check this out.

1837
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,980
So take me up on this plane and flying
around.

1838
01:20:23,981 --> 01:20:24,814
Yeah,

1839
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:27,520
it was crazy driving.
I'm a one on one to go look,

1840
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:31,190
but he had like a small plane and it's
like freedom you have when you have a

1841
01:20:31,191 --> 01:20:33,980
plain man you ever want to do that?
Fly Yourself?

1842
01:20:34,010 --> 01:20:36,530
Yeah.
But weird way to go when you know this

1843
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:39,200
fucking planes dying on you.
I've had cars die on me.

1844
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:40,103
Yeah,
no,

1845
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:43,360
I know the mechanical end of it.
Are you in mechanical or you?

1846
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:45,200
I'm not really.
I mean,

1847
01:20:45,201 --> 01:20:48,650
I know certain things,
but it's like someone saying,

1848
01:20:48,651 --> 01:20:50,000
yeah,
I took karate when I was 14.

1849
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:54,050
Right.
I ran my own stereo in my Toyota

1850
01:20:54,051 --> 01:20:55,280
Corolla.
I did that.

1851
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:57,470
But I wouldn't tell you that I could
install stereos.

1852
01:20:57,471 --> 01:20:58,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

1853
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,250
I know a little bit about cars.
I love them.

1854
01:21:01,550 --> 01:21:02,510
Yeah,
I do too.

1855
01:21:02,511 --> 01:21:04,000
But that's the thing.
It's like A.

1856
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:07,920
I feel like if you're gonna have your
own plane and you gotta be you gotTa

1857
01:21:07,921 --> 01:21:09,920
know,
really knowledgeable and on top of it

1858
01:21:09,921 --> 01:21:13,580
and you gotta know your limits.
And that's kind of my limit.

1859
01:21:13,850 --> 01:21:14,810
Yeah,
it was intense,

1860
01:21:14,811 --> 01:21:16,820
man.
The landing was intense because was a

1861
01:21:16,821 --> 01:21:19,960
little tiny plane man.
It was a little two seater plane so it

1862
01:21:19,961 --> 01:21:23,090
was just me and fell and uh,
we're coming into this land named white

1863
01:21:23,091 --> 01:21:24,170
cheeses.
It's right there.

1864
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:26,870
Like the grounds right.
Crazy.

1865
01:21:26,871 --> 01:21:30,080
It's weird.
It's a small plane and knowing that it's

1866
01:21:30,081 --> 01:21:33,320
like you're goofy friend from the set
taking you in.

1867
01:21:33,410 --> 01:21:35,960
Well,
he was always like an older brother to

1868
01:21:35,961 --> 01:21:37,130
me was in the set.
Yeah,

1869
01:21:37,131 --> 01:21:38,900
because he was,
he was older than me.

1870
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:40,453
Varianced

1871
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:44,790
like at least 16 years older,
maybe more,

1872
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:48,300
maybe 17,
18 years old or something like that.

1873
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:51,700
And he was a star already right when he
was us,

1874
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:56,760
like when we were on the set,
he is in movies all the time,

1875
01:21:56,761 --> 01:21:58,690
you know,
he was just getting off a Saturday night

1876
01:21:58,691 --> 01:22:01,080
live and uh,
you know,

1877
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:05,730
and then of course Dave Foley was a big
star from kids in the hall and he was a

1878
01:22:05,731 --> 01:22:09,870
big alternative star to like everybody
loved him because he was so smart and

1879
01:22:09,871 --> 01:22:12,690
the writing was so good.
And then Andy Dick was like a known

1880
01:22:12,691 --> 01:22:16,200
Weirdo and so it was,
it was a fascinating little grey.

1881
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:17,440
Bruce,
every

1882
01:22:17,450 --> 01:22:20,790
crew,
I remember spending a whole summer just

1883
01:22:20,791 --> 01:22:25,791
watching fills best of snl disc,
the funny and stuff that wasn't even a

1884
01:22:27,331 --> 01:22:30,000
hit,
like him playing the acting teacher.

1885
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:35,190
I mean I in a loop,
I could not stop watching it.

1886
01:22:35,191 --> 01:22:36,630
He was so,
this is something,

1887
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:38,400
this is nothing,
this is something,

1888
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:42,570
this is nothing.
And then he would like somebody like

1889
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:44,580
Sarah,
can I get out of my class?

1890
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:49,170
It was on the money 100 percent of the
time.

1891
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:50,070
Yeah,
man.

1892
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:54,340
He stand up to for the audience for fun.
Oh yeah.

1893
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:56,440
It would warm up the crowd,
but really,

1894
01:22:56,441 --> 01:22:57,930
you know,
he was like putting together almost like

1895
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:00,990
a little routine that he would do well
and we talked about is like,

1896
01:23:00,991 --> 01:23:02,130
oh,
I think I'm going to go on stage

1897
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:03,240
someday.
Wow.

1898
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:04,950
He just never.
I don't think he ever really did it

1899
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,160
though,
but he could have easily

1900
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:09,160
done it and his wife just got dale.
Hey Man.

1901
01:23:09,161 --> 01:23:10,390
She was troubled,
you know,

1902
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:14,200
choose a troubled person.
And she was also on Zoloft and cocaine.

1903
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:16,510
Oh my God.
Which apparently leads to psychotic

1904
01:23:16,511 --> 01:23:20,620
thoughts and it's apparently a very bad
combination,

1905
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:25,090
especially for some people which people
have their own particular sort of human

1906
01:23:25,091 --> 01:23:28,480
neurochemistry they got going on up
there and with some people when they do

1907
01:23:28,481 --> 01:23:31,990
coke and Zoloft together,
it just makes them insane.

1908
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,800
Yeah.
But the real,

1909
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:39,801
one of the real losses as a fan of his
is that he was the kind of guy that the

1910
01:23:40,241 --> 01:23:42,130
older he got,
the better he would become.

1911
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:44,920
He was playing guys who were older than
him.

1912
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:48,010
He had that very fatherly,
intelligent,

1913
01:23:48,011 --> 01:23:49,870
older kind of vibe.
Anyway.

1914
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:52,600
So it's as a 75,
80 year old,

1915
01:23:52,601 --> 01:23:54,520
he would still be killing it.
Yeah.

1916
01:23:54,521 --> 01:23:55,490
I think,
um,

1917
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:59,080
I think there's a million different
kinds of tragedies with the big one is

1918
01:23:59,081 --> 01:24:03,070
those kids had to deal with the fact
that mom killed them and then killed

1919
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:03,700
herself.

1920
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:04,670
How many?
Two,

1921
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,510
two kids.
And then they went and lived with family

1922
01:24:07,511 --> 01:24:08,740
afterwards.
Just the whole thing.

1923
01:24:08,741 --> 01:24:10,600
So dark.
It's so sad.

1924
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:12,880
It is,
man is the worst.

1925
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:14,510
But I mean it was,
it,

1926
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:18,670
it was also,
it's just more evidence of what happens

1927
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:22,530
when people are in those combative
relationships and they just don't know,

1928
01:24:22,610 --> 01:24:23,860
don't Gel together.
Well,

1929
01:24:23,861 --> 01:24:25,130
you know,
you have somebody look,

1930
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:29,090
if you've ever been around like just a
toxic person and it's like just one on

1931
01:24:29,091 --> 01:24:29,760
one.
You leave,

1932
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,860
you're like,
it's an energy that just drains you.

1933
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:35,140
And then imagine living with that
person.

1934
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:36,700
It's guest.
It's got.

1935
01:24:36,701 --> 01:24:38,120
It's too much work.
Yeah.

1936
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:39,760
Too much work.
But you know,

1937
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:42,820
he ever dated somebody who was really
kind of toxic.

1938
01:24:42,821 --> 01:24:44,710
It's kind of exciting.
At the same time.

1939
01:24:44,970 --> 01:24:48,100
Time's the freaky ones are the most fun
in bed.

1940
01:24:48,810 --> 01:24:49,930
Really crazy ones.
Yeah.

1941
01:24:49,931 --> 01:24:51,910
It gets a little crazy sometimes.

1942
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:55,300
Sometimes when you're young too.
Sometimes those breakup makeup fights

1943
01:24:55,301 --> 01:24:56,500
are awesome.
Yeah.

1944
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:57,910
You know,
when they come back you didn't think

1945
01:24:57,911 --> 01:24:59,590
they were coming back.
And next thing you know you're making

1946
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,690
out.
It's crazy when you hear the cops.

1947
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:04,030
Like,
what the fuck do you call the cops?

1948
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,340
Call them before I knew we were getting
back together.

1949
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:08,200
Jesus.
We're okay.

1950
01:25:08,201 --> 01:25:09,460
You're to escape.
No,

1951
01:25:09,461 --> 01:25:10,810
it's fine.
We're all right now.

1952
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:12,350
Just write an argument.
You're lazy.

1953
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:15,700
Get on the roof.
I saw a house on fire yesterday.

1954
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:16,840
Really?
Yeah.

1955
01:25:16,841 --> 01:25:20,980
Like up the street from me.
A whole like a house ablaze of the roof

1956
01:25:20,981 --> 01:25:25,090
was ablaze and it was up in the hills.
So they had two bad.

1957
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:26,830
Yeah.
To get the fire trucks up there.

1958
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:28,870
But then they stopped it like it's still
standing today.

1959
01:25:28,871 --> 01:25:32,710
But the roof is all,
but I've never seen like a whole house

1960
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:34,210
on fire.
Dude.

1961
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,970
I saw an entire,
I have to outdo you

1962
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:43,780
have oprah.
She used to like outdo people.

1963
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:45,980
But um,
when I was um,

1964
01:25:46,270 --> 01:25:50,800
working,
doing fear factor in like 2003,

1965
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:54,190
it was 2002 or three when they had that
giant fire,

1966
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:59,490
there was a joy and fire.
It was like on the way towards

1967
01:26:00,150 --> 01:26:03,980
Bakersfield up the five.
And we were filming up there at

1968
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:07,010
the home ranch.
There was a lake and we were dropping

1969
01:26:07,011 --> 01:26:09,140
these people off from helicopters to the
lake.

1970
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:14,260
And normally without traffic it's about
an hour 20 drive our half drive to la

1971
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:17,300
from,
from ranch.

1972
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:21,800
But this day it was bumper to bumper.
And uh,

1973
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:26,300
a guy died,
a guy ran out and got hit by a car and I

1974
01:26:26,301 --> 01:26:31,280
saw a sneaker and I saw him laying on
the side of the road like briefly as I

1975
01:26:31,281 --> 01:26:34,240
was passing while people were trying to
attend to him and I,

1976
01:26:34,241 --> 01:26:35,074
you know,
I didn't,

1977
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:37,460
I didn't like see his head splattered or
anything like that.

1978
01:26:37,461 --> 01:26:41,210
But I saw his leg.
And then my friend Matt told me that guy

1979
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:42,910
ended up dying.
And uh,

1980
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:45,830
so that was the beginning of this eerie
drive home.

1981
01:26:45,831 --> 01:26:50,390
Then as we got closer to la,
it was literally snowing,

1982
01:26:50,391 --> 01:26:55,100
ashes and the entire right side of the
highway was ablaze.

1983
01:26:55,130 --> 01:26:58,410
She as far I'm talking like a mile in
whom?

1984
01:26:58,450 --> 01:27:01,700
Like as far as the eye could see,
it looked like the fucking Lord of the

1985
01:27:01,701 --> 01:27:02,570
rings.
She was like,

1986
01:27:02,571 --> 01:27:07,571
I was waiting for demon horses to come
riding over the top and crazy high.

1987
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,660
Like it was insane.
There was tornadoes,

1988
01:27:11,661 --> 01:27:14,060
a fire,
I mean it was fucking fire everywhere

1989
01:27:14,090 --> 01:27:15,950
and you're in traffic at that point were
in traffic.

1990
01:27:15,951 --> 01:27:18,740
So you're just sitting there really
removed from it by a patch of grass,

1991
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:21,500
a bunch of asphalt.
And I'm telling you man,

1992
01:27:21,501 --> 01:27:25,190
I'm not bullshitting that side of the
road was like that for an hour,

1993
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:29,180
hour of driving.
Like the whole right side was like fire.

1994
01:27:29,270 --> 01:27:31,880
Yeah.
That's when we were coming from the

1995
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:35,340
[inaudible] were coming up the
[inaudible] towards like,

1996
01:27:35,341 --> 01:27:38,270
um,
encino and the entire right side,

1997
01:27:38,271 --> 01:27:40,910
like over the crest of the hill over
near the 1:18,

1998
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:44,390
the Simi Valley area ablaze ablaze.

1999
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:47,210
It was crazy.
I got evacuated from my house.

2000
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:47,960
Really?
Yeah.

2001
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:49,970
Yeah.
Threw the dog in the back of the truck

2002
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:52,550
pack,
grab a laptop and some stuff.

2003
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:55,740
No,
this was Johnny Cash and a of the

2004
01:27:56,570 --> 01:27:57,950
effects.
Not just dead at the time,

2005
01:27:58,970 --> 01:27:59,900
but uh,
it was,

2006
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:00,790
it was crazy,
man.

2007
01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:03,470
It was crazy.
We just intense here.

2008
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:04,760
Yeah.
People in my neighborhood,

2009
01:28:04,761 --> 01:28:08,270
you could see them like my stuff packed
to the roof and shit coming out and like

2010
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:11,630
rows of cars,
people pulling out of garages and Shit.

2011
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:12,710
It was trippy,
man.

2012
01:28:12,770 --> 01:28:16,430
That's the problem with some of those
more remote areas.

2013
01:28:16,431 --> 01:28:17,370
It's like,
oh no,

2014
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:20,570
he's surrounded by beautiful trees.
But after a couple of dry summers and

2015
01:28:20,571 --> 01:28:22,770
then some asshole with a cigarette.
Yeah,

2016
01:28:23,550 --> 01:28:24,800
yeah,
yeah.

2017
01:28:24,810 --> 01:28:26,090
It was,
it was fires.

2018
01:28:26,091 --> 01:28:27,270
Fucking terrifying man.
When,

2019
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:29,510
because I talked to this fireman and
this was,

2020
01:28:29,511 --> 01:28:32,840
it scared the shit out of me because
there's been a few of these big rock 'em

2021
01:28:32,841 --> 01:28:36,640
sock 'em fires that have hit the La area
most of the most.

2022
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:38,910
It's in the summer when the winds kick
up,

2023
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:42,080
one firefighter told me,
he goes,

2024
01:28:42,081 --> 01:28:44,480
dude,
it's just a matter of time before one

2025
01:28:44,481 --> 01:28:48,470
day of fire catches and it goes through
the entire city and we can't do shit

2026
01:28:48,471 --> 01:28:49,790
about it,
and I go,

2027
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:50,930
really?
He goes,

2028
01:28:50,931 --> 01:28:51,561
yeah.
He goes,

2029
01:28:51,561 --> 01:28:53,720
it's just the right conditions,
the right wind,

2030
01:28:53,930 --> 01:28:56,000
the fire coming from the right amount of
angles.

2031
01:28:56,210 --> 01:28:59,570
When the wind taking the the embers in
the air,

2032
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:01,950
lighting more houses on fire.
Oh my God.

2033
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,600
He goes,
it's just a matter of time for one day.

2034
01:29:03,601 --> 01:29:05,310
It goes right to the ocean.
I hate the.

2035
01:29:05,311 --> 01:29:06,960
It's just a matter of time.
Guys,

2036
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:12,840
the earthquake,
just a matter of time before this whole

2037
01:29:12,841 --> 01:29:14,820
place just falls off into the ocean.
Yeah.

2038
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:17,130
That's like glass half empty square.
Yeah.

2039
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:20,610
Just a matter of time before the big
plague hits takes us all out.

2040
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:23,190
They do say that a lot,
just matter of time before there's no

2041
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:24,740
more food left,
she's got,

2042
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:27,210
but where do you want to be?
Do you want to be somewhere?

2043
01:29:27,211 --> 01:29:29,160
You don't want to be a prepper right
now.

2044
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:32,610
She don't want to be the guy who dies of
starvation because he can't figure out

2045
01:29:32,611 --> 01:29:35,830
how to get by now you will be.
You want a couple?

2046
01:29:36,090 --> 01:29:40,890
You want to try your best?
Do you want to be rick from the walking

2047
01:29:40,891 --> 01:29:41,460
dead?

2048
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:44,160
It goes through several seasons of
horrific events.

2049
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:45,750
Basically.
Shattered man,

2050
01:29:45,751 --> 01:29:49,530
by the time I abandoned the show.
Or do you want to be one of the people

2051
01:29:49,531 --> 01:29:51,420
that gets killed early on?
So it's to wrap.

2052
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:54,690
I probably go somewhere in between.
Get a little adventure,

2053
01:29:55,050 --> 01:29:57,960
meet some new people,
make some mistakes.

2054
01:29:57,990 --> 01:30:00,000
You think you got it together and then
Wacko,

2055
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:04,080
but isn't like the walking dead,
the ultimate existential crisis because

2056
01:30:04,081 --> 01:30:06,540
if you do die,
you're going to come back as a Zombie.

2057
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:09,780
Yeah.
I think the only thing that can free you

2058
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:11,550
is,
I guess if you shoot yourself in the

2059
01:30:11,551 --> 01:30:12,510
head,
uh,

2060
01:30:12,511 --> 01:30:15,030
you'd have to shoot yourself in the head
because if you shoot a Zombie in the

2061
01:30:15,031 --> 01:30:16,200
head,
they just stopped being a Zombie

2062
01:30:16,201 --> 01:30:17,250
anymore.
Somehow or another,

2063
01:30:17,251 --> 01:30:19,260
there's a little button,
you know,

2064
01:30:19,261 --> 01:30:22,920
I feel like they're getting very,
a wishy washy with the Zombie rules

2065
01:30:22,921 --> 01:30:23,754
lately.

2066
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:25,400
I don't watch it anymore,
you know what I mean?

2067
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:29,760
Either I watched live zombies definitely
aren't consistent in their ability to

2068
01:30:29,761 --> 01:30:31,130
fuck things up.
Yeah.

2069
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:33,780
They used to be able to tear apart
horses and now they can,

2070
01:30:33,781 --> 01:30:35,190
like,
you can just push them aside,

2071
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:38,280
just like get outta here.
And they're like these bony little

2072
01:30:38,281 --> 01:30:40,800
things and yet they're kind of strong.
I don't get it.

2073
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:42,270
Yeah.
Now here's my question.

2074
01:30:42,690 --> 01:30:43,560
What are the,
um,

2075
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:47,550
why don't they rotted altogether by now?
Like why aren't they just a bag of

2076
01:30:47,551 --> 01:30:49,740
bones?
Like what's going on because they're not

2077
01:30:49,741 --> 01:30:51,290
real.
Oh,

2078
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:56,910
did you see what happened to big Sur?
What their big serve Ventana,

2079
01:30:57,690 --> 01:30:59,310
whatever,
Ranch Canyon ranch,

2080
01:30:59,311 --> 01:31:02,100
whatever it is,
they're completely isolated.

2081
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:07,220
They've had giant mud slides and that
part you can't enter or exit the town.

2082
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:09,810
Yeah,
they closed off like the one.

2083
01:31:09,811 --> 01:31:12,960
Yeah.
They're completely isolated right now

2084
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:15,750
and they're think they're going to be
able to open up the road coming from the

2085
01:31:15,751 --> 01:31:17,880
north by like September.

2086
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:20,310
What?
And they don't know if the south is ever

2087
01:31:20,311 --> 01:31:22,830
going to be repaired.
Oh my God.

2088
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:23,710
Go,
go,

2089
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:24,070
go,
go,

2090
01:31:24,070 --> 01:31:24,903
go,
go.

2091
01:31:24,990 --> 01:31:26,220
It's crazy.
Look at that,

2092
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:28,890
but let me see what it looks like.
Look at the title.

2093
01:31:28,891 --> 01:31:30,630
You have the title obscured.
Oh,

2094
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:33,120
landslide.
Barry's California scenic highway in big

2095
01:31:33,121 --> 01:31:34,380
Sur.
If you don't know big sir.

2096
01:31:34,381 --> 01:31:38,460
This is the most beautiful part of the
ride between La and San Francisco.

2097
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:42,270
My God,
the one look at the fucking landslide.

2098
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:44,400
Yeah.
They think that the only way they're

2099
01:31:44,401 --> 01:31:47,460
going to be able to do it is to just
build on the landslide.

2100
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:50,970
It's that much dirt.
More than a million tons of rock and

2101
01:31:50,971 --> 01:31:52,320
dirt fell dot.
Look at that.

2102
01:31:52,321 --> 01:31:56,340
It's insane.
The lance sladek skins a quarter of a

2103
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:57,300
mile.
It's just mountain.

2104
01:31:57,301 --> 01:32:00,250
Now the road is covered in a of dirt 35

2105
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,380
to 40 feet deep.
How many people are dead in there?

2106
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:05,530
I don't think that many.
The highway runs through big Sur,

2107
01:32:05,531 --> 01:32:10,030
which is a major tourist attraction.
Authorities of clothes all access to the

2108
01:32:10,031 --> 01:32:12,220
highway and don't know when it will
reopen.

2109
01:32:12,221 --> 01:32:15,520
How about get us fucking shovel?
All you need is 100 Mexicans.

2110
01:32:15,521 --> 01:32:17,610
It'll be done by tomorrow.
Hey,

2111
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:21,400
those people work hard metal detect
bullshit about the wall.

2112
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:24,220
Have these messages.
Let me show you Mr Trump.

2113
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:27,790
We can do again the metal detector.
Oh,

2114
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:30,310
you go crazy.
Look at today.

2115
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:31,720
I mean,
back then people died there.

2116
01:32:31,721 --> 01:32:33,550
It's million dollar.
I,

2117
01:32:33,551 --> 01:32:34,420
there's,
um,

2118
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:37,530
what is the Henry Miller Museum and the,
uh,

2119
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:41,260
serve and Tana,
all these beautiful places where you

2120
01:32:41,261 --> 01:32:44,290
would drive up and be able to stay
overnight and eat on the coast.

2121
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:46,960
You can't.
Those places are isolated.

2122
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,420
They weren't covered in the slide.
You just can't get to them.

2123
01:32:49,690 --> 01:32:51,460
Yeah.
So what you gotta do is you got to buy

2124
01:32:51,461 --> 01:32:55,160
real estate there.
Now policies will be panicking,

2125
01:32:55,190 --> 01:32:56,710
selling cheap.
You're right.

2126
01:32:56,770 --> 01:32:59,080
Scoop up a nice,
nice scenic view.

2127
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:02,500
Magic if that's your house sitting up
there chilling and all of a sudden you

2128
01:33:02,501 --> 01:33:05,740
slide all the way down to the ocean and
that's how you die.

2129
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:07,660
So courageous thing.
I finally made it.

2130
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,730
I got this beautiful view.
Look at my deck,

2131
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:11,140
hated him.
Come on over.

2132
01:33:11,141 --> 01:33:12,270
Bring bread,
Joe.

2133
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:14,680
I can't believe you did it.
Did it buddy.

2134
01:33:14,830 --> 01:33:16,390
We're having a.
it's still a moving.

2135
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:20,320
We haven't been able to go up there and
says it's still moving.

2136
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,360
Hey Joe,
was the yard supposed to be moving like

2137
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:24,820
that?
We have geologists and engineers who are

2138
01:33:24,821 --> 01:33:28,390
going to check out this week.
Check it out this week and see how do we

2139
01:33:28,391 --> 01:33:29,740
pick up the pieces?
The highway.

2140
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:30,760
Oh my God.

2141
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:33,910
Snakes around the California coastline
is a major tourist destination.

2142
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:36,610
Cruz called the landslide.
One of a kind,

2143
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:38,320
but it happened like a,
like a,

2144
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:41,230
like a month ago.
And then there's just like last

2145
01:33:41,230 --> 01:33:42,580
Saturday,
another chunk just went.

2146
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:44,830
So it's like,
it's still in motion.

2147
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:45,431
Yeah,
man.

2148
01:33:45,431 --> 01:33:46,970
That's what keeps me.
Things like that.

2149
01:33:46,971 --> 01:33:48,610
And what keeps me from living on the
ocean.

2150
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:51,510
I know I rented a house in Malibu and
uh,

2151
01:33:51,511 --> 01:33:55,240
one time I got super baked in and I went
down to the bottom floor.

2152
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:56,830
I was only in this house for like three
months,

2153
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:57,820
but it was like,
oh,

2154
01:33:57,820 --> 01:34:02,110
it was the bottom floor bedroom was the
water would literally go under it.

2155
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:05,290
Right?
And at night time it's fucking

2156
01:34:05,291 --> 01:34:08,410
horrifying.
It's scary in the daytime it's gorgeous

2157
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:11,500
looking out and you see that blue water
and so inviting.

2158
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:15,250
But at nighttime dot water is dark,
sky is black.

2159
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:16,570
And you're like,
oh my God.

2160
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:19,420
He'd like shows you what it really is.
I mean,

2161
01:34:19,421 --> 01:34:22,810
the ocean,
you're essentially at the whim of this

2162
01:34:22,811 --> 01:34:25,660
everchanging.
See you are riding on a gamble.

2163
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:28,810
And that gamble is what are the odds
that it's going to shift?

2164
01:34:28,811 --> 01:34:30,340
Now you know,
it's going to shift eventually.

2165
01:34:30,341 --> 01:34:32,350
That's right.
This house is probably worth like

2166
01:34:32,351 --> 01:34:35,500
millions of dollars and it's just
sitting on this water crazy.

2167
01:34:35,620 --> 01:34:38,590
You don't even have a front yard.
Your backyard is the ocean.

2168
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:39,590
There's,
um,

2169
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:41,940
my cousin has a place down,
uh,

2170
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:46,210
down towards San Diego and all these
beautiful multimillion dollar homes on

2171
01:34:46,211 --> 01:34:48,880
this cliff.
And they just keep shoring up the cliff,

2172
01:34:48,910 --> 01:34:53,910
they just keep putting in new planks,
got concrete rivet and they're just

2173
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:57,860
hanging on.
It's like someone some days in this

2174
01:34:57,861 --> 01:35:00,540
habit of mind when it goes down because
people,

2175
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:02,690
man,
when you're sitting there at the sunset

2176
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:04,790
and you're the,
it's just you and the ocean.

2177
01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:09,050
It is pretty spectacular.
It might be worth sliding and eventually

2178
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:14,760
you have to have is super baller money.
So you have that house on the coast and

2179
01:35:15,051 --> 01:35:18,470
then you have a house somewhere else or
you don't have a family and you're just

2180
01:35:18,471 --> 01:35:19,940
a dude with a surf board and you're
like,

2181
01:35:19,941 --> 01:35:22,280
this is the perfect spot.
If I lose everything.

2182
01:35:22,281 --> 01:35:23,120
So a,
so what?

2183
01:35:23,121 --> 01:35:24,740
I'll rent a house somewhere.
Yeah,

2184
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:25,820
I've done it already.
Yeah,

2185
01:35:25,821 --> 01:35:26,900
you could do that.
Yeah,

2186
01:35:26,901 --> 01:35:28,040
that would be good.
But you don't want to.

2187
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:31,960
You don't want to want your kids get
sucked away by the tide to you.

2188
01:35:35,390 --> 01:35:36,980
You're enjoying that pipe.
I do.

2189
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:37,910
It's good.
Right?

2190
01:35:37,910 --> 01:35:39,440
It's a little buzz.
I wish I had a cigar though.

2191
01:35:39,830 --> 01:35:42,650
I know.
I was actually thinking about bringing

2192
01:35:42,651 --> 01:35:44,840
cigars today.
I didn't to remember if you said we

2193
01:35:44,841 --> 01:35:45,680
could smoke in here.
Yeah,

2194
01:35:45,681 --> 01:35:46,700
we can.
Well,

2195
01:35:46,850 --> 01:35:48,470
in the new studio,
the new students,

2196
01:35:48,471 --> 01:35:50,000
like a mythical place that we keep
talking.

2197
01:35:50,001 --> 01:35:51,820
I know what's it actually exists.
People go like,

2198
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:52,970
oh,
he wasn't bullshitting.

2199
01:35:53,310 --> 01:35:54,720
You have been talking about it for
awhile.

2200
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,080
New Studio.
We're actually having ventilation

2201
01:35:57,081 --> 01:36:01,220
systems put in the ceiling so that it
can hit a button and it'll suck the

2202
01:36:01,221 --> 01:36:03,350
smoke out of the room.
Smells like rice.

2203
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,090
Clay's here.
Dice likes to smoke.

2204
01:36:05,150 --> 01:36:09,680
I don't smoke
everywhere,

2205
01:36:10,610 --> 01:36:14,030
but he'll smoke a pipe.
Won't make me nauseous.

2206
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:15,800
That's awesome.
Yeah.

2207
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:18,450
And then you will go home smelling
people won't get secondhand.

2208
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:21,590
We'd smoke too,
so it won't put you under.

2209
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:23,930
Right?
People complain about that.

2210
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:25,280
Um,
no.

2211
01:36:25,281 --> 01:36:27,970
I would never smoke in front of someone
that has an issue.

2212
01:36:28,470 --> 01:36:31,310
Like that was something I've had people
that have come on that uh,

2213
01:36:31,311 --> 01:36:33,500
specifically requested me not get high
in front of them.

2214
01:36:33,850 --> 01:36:35,760
They didn't know me that are like,
yeah,

2215
01:36:35,850 --> 01:36:36,950
that are in the program.
They're like,

2216
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:38,690
please don't have him to drugs in front
of me.

2217
01:36:38,810 --> 01:36:39,830
Yeah.
That makes sense.

2218
01:36:40,190 --> 01:36:42,300
You to get a little squirrelly,
Iowa.

2219
01:36:42,350 --> 01:36:43,730
Next time I'll bring.
I have A.

2220
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:47,840
I have a big box of Cuban cigars,
so nice,

2221
01:36:48,530 --> 01:36:50,180
strong.
They are strong.

2222
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:54,020
They're big to kind of.
He was so nice.

2223
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:57,740
The head rush is like,
yeah,

2224
01:36:57,770 --> 01:37:00,800
you might as well go to bed.
I used to like those oil de Monterrey,

2225
01:37:00,801 --> 01:37:03,320
double coronas,
those big fat posts.

2226
01:37:03,321 --> 01:37:08,120
Stake cigars,
a big steak and mashed potatoes with

2227
01:37:08,121 --> 01:37:11,450
sour cream and chives after Musso and
frank's.

2228
01:37:12,050 --> 01:37:14,300
Do you ever go to the cigar place next
to the Improv?

2229
01:37:15,910 --> 01:37:16,743
No,
I have not.

2230
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:18,240
I know that spot,
so that's not.

2231
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:20,360
I've never been in there.
If you're ever doing two shows,

2232
01:37:20,361 --> 01:37:23,750
they're screwing around.
It's a nice little hang.

2233
01:37:23,810 --> 01:37:26,740
You want to get away from the club for a
minute because sitting there,

2234
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:28,280
they're really the guy who runs.
It's great.

2235
01:37:28,580 --> 01:37:30,050
It's a good spot.
That's cool.

2236
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,610
Yeah.
I really liked the Improv,

2237
01:37:31,611 --> 01:37:33,800
man.
The improv is a different vibe now.

2238
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:35,390
I've been going there a lot lately.
Have you?

2239
01:37:35,410 --> 01:37:36,830
Yeah.
It's a different vibe.

2240
01:37:36,831 --> 01:37:38,780
It feels good.
Everything feels good now,

2241
01:37:38,781 --> 01:37:40,070
man.
Comedy feels great.

2242
01:37:40,090 --> 01:37:41,080
This is a good time,
man.

2243
01:37:41,150 --> 01:37:43,080
It really is.
Beautiful.

2244
01:37:43,130 --> 01:37:44,660
Where did you do last night?
Well,

2245
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:46,460
one of the things I did that was really
interesting.

2246
01:37:46,461 --> 01:37:48,740
I did a podcast with my friend Owen
Smith.

2247
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:49,231
Do you know?
Oh,

2248
01:37:49,231 --> 01:37:50,890
in laval and he's hilarious.

2249
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:52,490
He makes me laugh.
Funny.

2250
01:37:52,491 --> 01:37:56,190
Such a good subtle,
solid guy.

2251
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:57,560
Good guy.
Yeah.

2252
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:58,460
Anyway.
Oh,

2253
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:03,460
in has a new show that he's coming out
with a called a something notebooks with

2254
01:38:04,111 --> 01:38:08,610
Owen Smith and what it is is you find
your oldest comedy notebooks and bring

2255
01:38:08,611 --> 01:38:12,510
it out and go over your material and I
found some notebooks from 1990.

2256
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:14,430
That's great.
I had a list,

2257
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:18,960
a setlist from 93 new material lists
from 1993.

2258
01:38:18,961 --> 01:38:21,060
March of 94.
I was like,

2259
01:38:21,061 --> 01:38:21,960
wow,
this is crazy.

2260
01:38:21,961 --> 01:38:26,400
It was terrible.
It was like needles through my soul.

2261
01:38:26,610 --> 01:38:31,610
Reading off my lines said so hard.
Terrible Bullshit when I was 21 is.

2262
01:38:34,170 --> 01:38:35,970
This is really saying something,
man.

2263
01:38:36,150 --> 01:38:39,090
I had A.
I had orchestrated crowdwork I'd like

2264
01:38:39,091 --> 01:38:42,570
written in crowd.
So terrible.

2265
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:45,290
It was so bad.
I showed it to the.

2266
01:38:45,490 --> 01:38:46,323
I showed it to the

2267
01:38:48,530 --> 01:38:51,100
learning.
I have a tape.

2268
01:38:51,101 --> 01:38:54,760
I have a cassette tape.
The video tape,

2269
01:38:54,910 --> 01:38:59,230
vhs tape of me doing standup at stand up
New York like in my first year.

2270
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:04,330
Oh my God,
like 93 and I am 30 pounds heavier tight

2271
01:39:04,331 --> 01:39:06,190
jeans.
I think I'm wearing a vest,

2272
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:10,030
a curly hair,
and I would lunge when I would tell the

2273
01:39:10,031 --> 01:39:14,990
jokes like this Elvis Kinda of love and
I wouldn't.

2274
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:20,040
I was so scared to hear if they were
going to laugh or not that I would just

2275
01:39:20,201 --> 01:39:23,020
go a thousand miles an hour just
yelling.

2276
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:27,850
I thought it was kinison
kid isn't without the jokes.

2277
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:31,140
They gonna catch you.
If you pause for a sec.

2278
01:39:32,090 --> 01:39:34,840
What?
I didn't give him a split second.

2279
01:39:34,900 --> 01:39:35,740
I just went,

2280
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:38,750
yeah.
That one thing that some comedians will

2281
01:39:38,751 --> 01:39:40,460
do,
especially in the early days with they

2282
01:39:40,461 --> 01:39:44,470
like say a bunch of things in a row and
then memorize it and the audience will

2283
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:47,990
clap at the end of the.
At the end they're big memorization

2284
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:50,690
and that edit,
edit,

2285
01:39:50,691 --> 01:39:51,210
edit,
edit,

2286
01:39:51,210 --> 01:39:52,043
edit.

2287
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:55,620
It's the closest you get to a guitar
riff.

2288
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:00,890
Well,
that in my opinion is where dice had

2289
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:05,380
everybody beat in the 19 eighties
because people would go to see him and

2290
01:40:05,381 --> 01:40:09,830
it would repeat his lines.
They wanted to hear what's in the bowl.

2291
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:13,760
The whole audience do it.
Just like a fucking rock concert.

2292
01:40:13,770 --> 01:40:15,350
Hazy that you can't.
That's,

2293
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:17,210
that's a one of a kind experience.
Yeah.

2294
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:18,290
Can't replicate.
Yeah.

2295
01:40:18,310 --> 01:40:23,240
I mean dice had something that was
different because they were going to see

2296
01:40:23,241 --> 01:40:25,700
stuff.
They already knew that he would go.

2297
01:40:25,701 --> 01:40:30,470
I'll go rick dog.
Crazy.

2298
01:40:32,270 --> 01:40:35,600
I'm still weirded out when I hang out
with dice still to this day.

2299
01:40:35,620 --> 01:40:36,920
He was a rockstar.
Well,

2300
01:40:36,921 --> 01:40:38,420
when I'm in the room with them,
I weared out.

2301
01:40:38,450 --> 01:40:39,380
Oh,
I can't even believe that.

2302
01:40:39,390 --> 01:40:40,310
Dice Clay.
Yeah,

2303
01:40:40,311 --> 01:40:41,760
it's crazy.
It was.

2304
01:40:41,780 --> 01:40:44,450
Now he was so big and my girlfriend,
we were 19.

2305
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:48,230
We're sitting in my car.
I was dating this hot Nicaraguan girl.

2306
01:40:48,470 --> 01:40:50,510
Nice.
She had a great sense of humors.

2307
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:53,620
Hilarious.
But we're sitting in my car listening to

2308
01:40:53,621 --> 01:40:55,390
this fucking dice.
Clay tape.

2309
01:40:55,391 --> 01:40:57,350
Just house crying,
laughing.

2310
01:40:57,970 --> 01:41:01,510
It was so stupid because when you're 19,
that is like the perfect kind of comedy

2311
01:41:01,511 --> 01:41:02,740
for you.
Oh God,

2312
01:41:02,741 --> 01:41:04,660
you know,
it's just on a tough fit.

2313
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:12,200
Little boy blue.
Do you ever see him do a long setback

2314
01:41:15,191 --> 01:41:16,024
then?
Was it?

2315
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:17,920
I only saw like short sets.
Yeah,

2316
01:41:17,930 --> 01:41:22,930
like I went to see him live.
I saw him a couple of times and then I

2317
01:41:25,001 --> 01:41:26,980
saw him.
Would he do that?

2318
01:41:26,981 --> 01:41:31,270
The hallway I saw in the store a lot in
the nineties when it was just sort of

2319
01:41:31,271 --> 01:41:33,490
fucking around.
But when he would come to the store,

2320
01:41:33,491 --> 01:41:35,680
it wasn't like a set,
like a concert set.

2321
01:41:36,030 --> 01:41:37,990
It was like he was working on new
material.

2322
01:41:37,991 --> 01:41:42,700
He was fucking around just just working
out when we do long sets.

2323
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:44,800
I mean everyone was waiting for the
nursery rhymes.

2324
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:47,140
Oh yeah,
she still does nursery rhyme stuff.

2325
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:51,670
I saw him,
me and Jim Norton and Anthony Kumi.

2326
01:41:51,671 --> 01:41:53,700
Uh,
and who the fuck else was it?

2327
01:41:53,890 --> 01:41:58,890
I think Bobby Kelly and red band went to
see him in Vegas at the Riviera.

2328
01:41:59,650 --> 01:42:01,420
That's great.
Which is just recently.

2329
01:42:01,510 --> 01:42:03,580
No,
obviously the Riviera is dead now.

2330
01:42:03,590 --> 01:42:05,900
Yeah,
I think it was probably five years ago.

2331
01:42:05,901 --> 01:42:07,270
Maybe.
Maybe a little more,

2332
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:08,320
but God,
Dan,

2333
01:42:08,321 --> 01:42:10,570
we had a great time when I saw the whole
set.

2334
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:14,380
I saw his whole set and it was great.
It's great.

2335
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:18,780
He was a monster dude.
He was a killer and human.

2336
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:19,930
The Woody Allen Movie,
I'm sure.

2337
01:42:19,931 --> 01:42:20,890
Yeah,
it was really good.

2338
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:22,570
Yeah,
really good.

2339
01:42:23,050 --> 01:42:24,760
That Woody Allen movie weirds me out
though.

2340
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:30,430
That was movies all weird me out now
because it's so crazy because of the guy

2341
01:42:30,460 --> 01:42:31,840
because of who he is.
Who he is.

2342
01:42:31,841 --> 01:42:32,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

2343
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:37,180
I think he's still a brilliant director
and a great screenwriter,

2344
01:42:37,630 --> 01:42:38,980
but it's just like,
you almost.

2345
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:42,430
There's certain things you expect,
you know.

2346
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:44,530
Ah,
he got hooked on pills that happens.

2347
01:42:44,980 --> 01:42:47,110
Uh,
is a boozer happens.

2348
01:42:48,250 --> 01:42:50,350
It turns out he was gay.
Happens.

2349
01:42:50,940 --> 01:42:52,240
Oh,
he's fucking his daughter.

2350
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:53,970
That happened.

2351
01:42:56,910 --> 01:42:59,180
How old was she when he met her?
Yeah,

2352
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:01,360
she was too.
Yeah,

2353
01:43:02,230 --> 01:43:03,880
I don't know.
That's that great.

2354
01:43:04,350 --> 01:43:08,160
A great joke by Emo Philips,
one of the

2355
01:43:09,670 --> 01:43:13,530
Woody Allen adopted Sunni when she was
four years old,

2356
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:19,800
started dating her when she was 15.
Patience of a saint.

2357
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:26,020
Is that what he did?
He started dating when she was 15.

2358
01:43:26,021 --> 01:43:29,380
Is that right there like that?
I don't know Christ,

2359
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:31,840
but you know,
you find out anything about an artist.

2360
01:43:31,841 --> 01:43:33,370
You're gonna Mount Lake.
Right?

2361
01:43:33,371 --> 01:43:34,900
But here's,
here's the question again.

2362
01:43:34,901 --> 01:43:36,070
Is it me?
Is it me?

2363
01:43:36,071 --> 01:43:39,460
Is it the same thing about my friend
jerking off his dog with his foot?

2364
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:41,560
Is it just on me?
I mean,

2365
01:43:41,561 --> 01:43:43,720
what if.
I mean it sounds gross,

2366
01:43:43,930 --> 01:43:48,760
but what if after all those years they
really were in love with each other?

2367
01:43:48,850 --> 01:43:51,410
Does that make sense?
It seems like it now,

2368
01:43:51,411 --> 01:43:51,861
right?
I mean,

2369
01:43:51,861 --> 01:43:52,040
he's

2370
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:55,250
an old man and they're stolen.
They're still in love and hanging out.

2371
01:43:55,251 --> 01:43:58,160
And is that unacceptable?
I don't know.

2372
01:43:58,310 --> 01:44:00,080
It's unacceptable.
If people get hurt,

2373
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:02,180
no one got hurt.
You can't.

2374
01:44:02,181 --> 01:44:03,014
Do you what?
I mean,

2375
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:05,630
there's a lot of pictures before and
after.

2376
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:07,030
Yeah,
but I heard some of these are.

2377
01:44:07,190 --> 01:44:11,660
I heard there was some
weirdness and some of the weirdness

2378
01:44:11,661 --> 01:44:13,790
here.
This is a little girl and he's with her

2379
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:16,340
and then he wound up marrying her,
but that's weird,

2380
01:44:16,341 --> 01:44:18,350
man.
It's just weird.

2381
01:44:18,630 --> 01:44:20,750
It really didn't make her,
but he will look.

2382
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:24,230
He's not arrested and he's not in jail,
so it's not right.

2383
01:44:24,231 --> 01:44:27,170
And it didn't everything.
Wasn't there a case.

2384
01:44:27,171 --> 01:44:28,790
I mean,
didn't they investigate and find him,

2385
01:44:28,850 --> 01:44:31,040
find him innocent of all this?
I don't know,

2386
01:44:31,041 --> 01:44:33,710
man.
That's the problem with the problem with

2387
01:44:33,711 --> 01:44:35,120
these accusations to.
I mean,

2388
01:44:35,130 --> 01:44:37,850
you know,
the accusations of that stuff is so

2389
01:44:37,851 --> 01:44:40,460
huge.
Even if you're found innocent,

2390
01:44:41,370 --> 01:44:45,110
uh,
that doesn't compare to the charge.

2391
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:48,990
Was He found innocent?
Like did they go to

2392
01:44:49,100 --> 01:44:51,890
court?
I don't know if he was a criminal.

2393
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,770
He tried.
I don't think he did anything criminal.

2394
01:44:54,771 --> 01:44:57,260
So there was no evidence to even.
I don't think so.

2395
01:44:57,261 --> 01:45:01,070
I think there was a time where Mia
Farrow was saying that he had done

2396
01:45:01,071 --> 01:45:02,690
something to one of their other
daughters.

2397
01:45:02,850 --> 01:45:05,420
Right.
And then what he was saying that the

2398
01:45:05,450 --> 01:45:10,010
daughter was coached by me and that me
is crazy and she's furious that he wound

2399
01:45:10,011 --> 01:45:11,990
up with Suny.
It's all crazy.

2400
01:45:12,150 --> 01:45:14,430
It's all crazy.
But I'll tell you,

2401
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:19,500
I can shove it aside and watch crimes
and misdemeanors over and over and over.

2402
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:23,280
So one of the greatest of all time.
What was the one we.

2403
01:45:23,281 --> 01:45:26,640
It was the space movie.
I'm

2404
01:45:28,230 --> 01:45:30,090
a sleeper sleep,
right?

2405
01:45:30,091 --> 01:45:31,650
Yeah.
That was a freaky movie.

2406
01:45:31,890 --> 01:45:32,723
I mean,
so,

2407
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:34,860
so good.
Just what he's doing now and he's made

2408
01:45:34,861 --> 01:45:38,160
two movies a year for how many years
does it make to a year?

2409
01:45:38,730 --> 01:45:39,541
Does he?
Yeah.

2410
01:45:39,541 --> 01:45:41,340
The spring project,
the fall project.

2411
01:45:42,070 --> 01:45:43,740
It was really funky.
Barcelona,

2412
01:45:43,890 --> 01:45:46,950
midnight in Paris,
midnight in Paris is amazing.

2413
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:49,430
What was really weird watching Owen
Benjamin,

2414
01:45:49,490 --> 01:45:53,510
that not on Benjamin Owen Wilson and
Owen Wilson basically doing with him.

2415
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:57,470
I mean he really was doing a version of
woody allen and it totally worked.

2416
01:45:57,590 --> 01:45:59,090
It totally worked.
Totally worked.

2417
01:45:59,150 --> 01:46:00,950
I mean,
I wouldn't did a great job.

2418
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:02,510
Oh,
that movie was so good.

2419
01:46:02,511 --> 01:46:05,210
He was really like.
He was channeling like a woody allen.

2420
01:46:05,211 --> 01:46:07,160
Like even the way you read the lines.
Same

2421
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:08,110
vibe.
Yeah.

2422
01:46:08,390 --> 01:46:13,390
Just the just the exist is amazing and
tolerating ridiculous shit.

2423
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:15,950
They were full,
tolerating ridiculous shift from each

2424
01:46:15,951 --> 01:46:17,840
other and having affairs.
Yeah.

2425
01:46:17,930 --> 01:46:20,480
You know,
just the Paris exists.

2426
01:46:20,481 --> 01:46:24,210
Isn't that a beautiful film?
I'm pretty amazing.

2427
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:26,750
Amazing work.
While he's a Weirdo,

2428
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:29,030
I heard it.
Weirdos have weird thoughts.

2429
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:31,220
That's the thing,
like some more creative.

2430
01:46:31,221 --> 01:46:34,010
I mean,
whatever reason I know and I just don't

2431
01:46:34,011 --> 01:46:38,090
have the connection that Ronan Farrow
obviously has to do it.

2432
01:46:38,091 --> 01:46:42,470
He can't watch those movies,
but Tom Papa sitting in is a place

2433
01:46:42,471 --> 01:46:44,830
watching the movie.
I'm not connected enough where it to

2434
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:48,350
bump me out of watching the art.
All artists are freaky.

2435
01:46:48,351 --> 01:46:51,330
If he'd get down underneath it,
I'm sure there's a lot of people that we

2436
01:46:51,331 --> 01:46:54,510
adore who did some pretty heinous shit.
Yeah.

2437
01:46:54,511 --> 01:46:57,460
When someone like David Carradine dies
wearing a wetsuit with a dildo or

2438
01:46:57,461 --> 01:47:01,080
possess hanging in a hotel right now,
didn't he die?

2439
01:47:01,530 --> 01:47:04,470
Autoerotic expectation.
The guy from nxs,

2440
01:47:04,471 --> 01:47:07,080
same thing.
It was like a lot of people die doing

2441
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:10,590
really freaky shit and some weird stuff.
People are weird.

2442
01:47:11,130 --> 01:47:12,630
Don't,
don't dig too deep.

2443
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:16,680
It's better just to know people on the
surface or just let it go.

2444
01:47:16,710 --> 01:47:17,960
Accept.
Yeah.

2445
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:20,140
No,
but that's just the the only.

2446
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:22,440
I mean I'm almost always willing to do
that.

2447
01:47:22,620 --> 01:47:25,560
Almost always willing to do that,
but the woody allen one makes it go,

2448
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:28,830
but the bill cosby one does not make me
want to do that.

2449
01:47:28,831 --> 01:47:31,410
I don't want to.
That one is just like I got to write you

2450
01:47:31,411 --> 01:47:33,840
off forever.
Forever.

2451
01:47:33,870 --> 01:47:35,550
Right?
Drugged and raped.

2452
01:47:35,551 --> 01:47:36,720
50 women.
Yeah.

2453
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:37,830
That one.
Definitely.

2454
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:40,260
That's a.
that's a lifetime right off.

2455
01:47:40,350 --> 01:47:43,740
If he had made crimes and misdemeanors.
Maybe Polygon.

2456
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:47,910
Albert just to up.
What about Roman Polanski?

2457
01:47:48,190 --> 01:47:50,190
Deacon.
Can you still watch fat Albert,

2458
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:51,510
her,
her.

2459
01:47:51,570 --> 01:47:53,340
Hey.
It's like fat Albert.

2460
01:47:53,341 --> 01:47:56,430
Difficult to fund.
I doubt it because it seems like fat

2461
01:47:56,431 --> 01:47:59,820
Albert kind of reinforced a certain
racial stereotypes that he might

2462
01:47:59,821 --> 01:48:01,680
probably disagree with as he became
older.

2463
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:04,460
I don't know.
There was a little moral stuff there and

2464
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,390
was everybody getting along?
Yeah.

2465
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:09,750
Do you remember?
That was always the rumor that he had

2466
01:48:09,751 --> 01:48:13,620
bought out the little rascals and then
he had kept it from being aired because

2467
01:48:13,621 --> 01:48:17,250
it was racist because of the buckwheat
stuff and all that racist stuff in it.

2468
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:20,250
Was that true?
I think that was snopes and I think they

2469
01:48:20,251 --> 01:48:21,810
found that it wasn't true.
Oh really?

2470
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:24,120
Yeah.
That he bought the rights to it and

2471
01:48:24,121 --> 01:48:25,440
wouldn't let it be shown.
Yeah.

2472
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:29,130
Find out if that's true.
There was a lot of racist stuff back

2473
01:48:29,131 --> 01:48:30,000
then.
Dude,

2474
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:33,000
we were talking to the comedy store last
night about how,

2475
01:48:33,001 --> 01:48:34,860
uh,
people in the old days used to smack

2476
01:48:34,861 --> 01:48:38,040
people,
like how often you'd see a movie of were

2477
01:48:38,041 --> 01:48:41,450
like Humphrey bogart would smack some
woman in the face and that wind up

2478
01:48:41,451 --> 01:48:42,150
making out with her.

2479
01:48:42,150 --> 01:48:43,650
Yeah.
It's just how it went.

2480
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:47,310
Smack each other.
Women would smack men.

2481
01:48:47,311 --> 01:48:49,350
Men would swhack women smack,
smack.

2482
01:48:49,740 --> 01:48:50,950
I love watching.
Uh,

2483
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:51,841
it's a mad,
mad,

2484
01:48:51,841 --> 01:48:52,310
mad,
mad,

2485
01:48:52,310 --> 01:48:54,840
mad,
mad world wars that you've never seen

2486
01:48:54,841 --> 01:48:55,680
that.
Oh,

2487
01:48:55,681 --> 01:48:58,800
come on.
It's one of the greatest comedy films of

2488
01:48:58,801 --> 01:49:00,090
all time.
Who was their

2489
01:49:02,010 --> 01:49:03,100
Buddy Hackett?
Oh,

2490
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:05,520
Jonathan winters.
Jack Benny,

2491
01:49:06,210 --> 01:49:09,600
Mickey Rooney.
I'm Henny youngman.

2492
01:49:09,810 --> 01:49:12,090
Really?
I mean Milton Berle.

2493
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:12,901
Wow.
I mean,

2494
01:49:12,901 --> 01:49:16,140
it's endless.
It was just all Spencer Tracy all

2495
01:49:16,141 --> 01:49:21,141
putting this crazy film about a trying
to race across from the desert to Santa

2496
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:26,220
Monica and Phil Silvers,
all these.

2497
01:49:26,221 --> 01:49:26,990
I mean,
great.

2498
01:49:26,990 --> 01:49:30,540
It was like the,
the comedy film of its time and it still

2499
01:49:30,541 --> 01:49:32,190
holds up.
It's still great to watch.

2500
01:49:32,191 --> 01:49:33,660
You would love it.
You have to watch all.

2501
01:49:34,530 --> 01:49:39,530
The thing I love is everybody screams.
Everyone is just yelling at each other.

2502
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:41,830
You Moron,
you,

2503
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:43,680
Eddie had.
You got to be into this way.

2504
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:47,980
It's so cathartic.
A time where everyone

2505
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:49,720
has to be so reserved and say the right
thing.

2506
01:49:50,150 --> 01:49:52,670
Everyone's just like,
you're a moron.

2507
01:49:53,350 --> 01:49:56,870
Slapping each other in the face.
It's so much fun.

2508
01:49:57,110 --> 01:49:58,730
People would just harsher to each other
back then.

2509
01:49:58,790 --> 01:49:59,720
Oh,
it's great.

2510
01:50:00,310 --> 01:50:01,460
I mean,
it's a different world,

2511
01:50:01,470 --> 01:50:02,870
right?
A totally different world.

2512
01:50:03,290 --> 01:50:04,340
Not that long ago,
you know,

2513
01:50:04,350 --> 01:50:07,770
you would little rascals.
And Bill Cosby did bill cosby sat

2514
01:50:07,820 --> 01:50:08,720
status?
False.

2515
01:50:08,721 --> 01:50:10,430
It says origin Spanky,
Alfalfa,

2516
01:50:10,431 --> 01:50:11,300
buckwheat.
Darla,

2517
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:14,030
just a few.
The easily recognizable names were a

2518
01:50:14,031 --> 01:50:16,790
fond part of the childhoods of
generations of kids,

2519
01:50:16,791 --> 01:50:17,900
beloved characters,
blah,

2520
01:50:17,901 --> 01:50:18,734
blah,
blah.

2521
01:50:19,140 --> 01:50:23,420
Just a rumor that started around 1989.
Where can you get little rascals now?

2522
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:25,240
Uh,
you can probably buy it online.

2523
01:50:25,241 --> 01:50:27,100
I don't know if it's officially on Hulu
or anything.

2524
01:50:27,101 --> 01:50:29,950
I didn't look for that,
but it says it's been licensed in this

2525
01:50:29,951 --> 01:50:31,450
indication since 1997.

2526
01:50:31,740 --> 01:50:34,890
Bill cosby has never owned any part of
the rights of the little rascals.

2527
01:50:35,110 --> 01:50:35,920
Oh,
so it's.

2528
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,540
Oh Shit.
Another one that popped up at city tried

2529
01:50:37,541 --> 01:50:41,980
to block Amos.
And Andy from being on TV to CBS with

2530
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:44,410
syndication know Amos and Andy,

2531
01:50:44,510 --> 01:50:47,300
Ted Turner had bought up the rights of
the TV show the Dukes of hazard to keep

2532
01:50:47,301 --> 01:50:49,100
it off television because of his
demeaning,

2533
01:50:49,550 --> 01:50:52,910
demeaning portrayal of southerners.
That series is well.

2534
01:50:52,911 --> 01:50:55,390
This is old and says it's currently
syndicated on Tnn.

2535
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:57,470
It's not anymore.
Neither rumors,

2536
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:58,970
but that's not true either.
They don't.

2537
01:50:58,971 --> 01:51:00,470
Um,
they don't hear it anywhere anymore.

2538
01:51:00,471 --> 01:51:01,490
Right?
Isn't that the deal?

2539
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:04,880
Like they didn't like digitally remove
the confederate flag?

2540
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:08,420
No.
There was a,

2541
01:51:08,421 --> 01:51:11,630
um,
something today about the confederate

2542
01:51:11,631 --> 01:51:13,160
flag.
Oh Man.

2543
01:51:14,330 --> 01:51:16,670
What was in the news today about the
confederate flag?

2544
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:21,720
The mayor,
the mayor of New Orleans has given one

2545
01:51:21,721 --> 01:51:23,970
of the best speeches I think,
of our lifetime.

2546
01:51:24,900 --> 01:51:27,480
That guy did then.
Someone else did something terrible

2547
01:51:27,481 --> 01:51:28,051
today.
Oh,

2548
01:51:28,051 --> 01:51:30,420
really?
Civil war museum closes after spat with

2549
01:51:30,421 --> 01:51:31,830
confederate flags.
That's not it.

2550
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:33,630
Um,
the speech,

2551
01:51:33,650 --> 01:51:35,670
if you.
Something about someone refusing to take

2552
01:51:35,671 --> 01:51:40,150
down the confederate flag.
Confederate flag comes down.

2553
01:51:40,151 --> 01:51:41,520
Accusations fly.
There's no,

2554
01:51:41,550 --> 01:51:42,383
no,
no,

2555
01:51:43,090 --> 01:51:47,070
I don't think that's it.
It'll just be searching.

2556
01:51:47,250 --> 01:51:48,600
You'd be searching.
But it was some,

2557
01:51:48,601 --> 01:51:53,130
another politician who was refusing to
take down the confederate flag and you

2558
01:51:53,131 --> 01:51:54,810
know,
Mississippi has it as a part of their

2559
01:51:54,811 --> 01:51:56,430
state flag.
Oh really?

2560
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:58,860
Yeah.
The Mississippi state flag is like

2561
01:51:58,950 --> 01:52:00,570
confederate flag in the corner of.
Right,

2562
01:52:00,571 --> 01:52:01,260
right.

2563
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:04,140
The mayor of New Orleans,
I forget his name,

2564
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:10,280
gave this eloquent 20 minute speech
about the removal of four statues in New

2565
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:14,820
Orleans,
Robert e Dot Lee civil war era things.

2566
01:52:15,570 --> 01:52:18,240
So eloquent.
The points he makes.

2567
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:20,760
It's really about togetherness.
Moving ahead.

2568
01:52:21,120 --> 01:52:26,100
We have to realize that this was a part.
This was a wound to our country

2569
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:28,800
and it never healed.
Right?

2570
01:52:28,980 --> 01:52:32,010
And this is part of making it.
He'll write and taking down these

2571
01:52:32,011 --> 01:52:34,470
statues,
try and explain to a five year old girl

2572
01:52:34,620 --> 01:52:37,080
who lives in this city of what that
means,

2573
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:41,820
but it was put up right after the civil
war to let people know that this is the

2574
01:52:41,821 --> 01:52:45,030
way thing.
It was a white supremist supremacists

2575
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:48,020
movement that put those up there.
You explain that to a five year old

2576
01:52:48,021 --> 01:52:50,690
girl.
How are we going to move forward in the

2577
01:52:50,691 --> 01:52:54,620
culture if we don't get these removed?
This isn't about,

2578
01:52:54,621 --> 01:52:56,510
hey,
this isn't about revenge is about moving

2579
01:52:56,511 --> 01:52:59,930
forward.
He 20 minutes in in a time like we're

2580
01:52:59,931 --> 01:53:04,931
talking about a rush of just news and
constant noise and chatter and tweets.

2581
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:10,600
Sky Takes Twenty minutes,
eloquently commonly makes the case in a

2582
01:53:10,821 --> 01:53:13,610
way that my paraphrasing doesn't do it.
Any justice.

2583
01:53:13,611 --> 01:53:16,070
Bulletproof bulletproof case,
bulletproof.

2584
01:53:16,130 --> 01:53:17,180
It's so great.

2585
01:53:17,310 --> 01:53:18,143
Yeah.
You know,

2586
01:53:18,150 --> 01:53:21,030
I think the problem with the confederate
flag and even some of the figures in the

2587
01:53:21,031 --> 01:53:25,410
civil war,
they get connected in a lot of people's

2588
01:53:25,411 --> 01:53:28,860
mind to southern pride in where they're
from.

2589
01:53:28,861 --> 01:53:32,310
Like southern southern pride,
Leonard Skinner heard,

2590
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:33,330
you know,
that kind of shit.

2591
01:53:33,420 --> 01:53:37,020
I mean,
I always had that fucking confederate

2592
01:53:37,021 --> 01:53:39,540
flag and their shirts,
I know Mina was.

2593
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:44,040
It wasn't just a racist symbol of white
supremacy,

2594
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:46,890
but it is a racist symbol of white
supremacy.

2595
01:53:46,891 --> 01:53:47,680
It's both.
Yeah.

2596
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:48,980
You,
you right.

2597
01:53:48,990 --> 01:53:52,320
And you got to kind of give that up and
have pride.

2598
01:53:52,350 --> 01:53:55,200
You could still pride in the south.
You can still be a kick ass southerner

2599
01:53:55,210 --> 01:53:58,110
who loves the south for all the good
reasons.

2600
01:53:58,350 --> 01:53:59,220
You know,
what they need to do.

2601
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:01,920
They need to come up with a new flag.
Like there's nothing wrong with the

2602
01:54:01,921 --> 01:54:05,390
south avenue flag as long as the south
recognize it's part of America like

2603
01:54:05,730 --> 01:54:06,120
that.

2604
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:08,190
Just something that replaces the
confederate flag,

2605
01:54:08,191 --> 01:54:11,520
but includes everybody know,
like something that's not connected to a

2606
01:54:11,521 --> 01:54:14,680
totally meant to try to keep slavery.
That was one comment he made to just.

2607
01:54:15,150 --> 01:54:16,890
This was a move,
a flawed movement.

2608
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:20,850
This wasn't fighting for America.
This was fighting to tear apart America

2609
01:54:21,330 --> 01:54:22,850
and we need new symbols.
You know,

2610
01:54:22,851 --> 01:54:26,190
like a perfect example is the flag of
Texas with the star.

2611
01:54:26,250 --> 01:54:27,480
Yeah.
Bad Ass.

2612
01:54:27,510 --> 01:54:28,400
That's,
that's,

2613
01:54:28,401 --> 01:54:31,290
it's,
that's like taxes might as well be its

2614
01:54:31,291 --> 01:54:32,124
own country,
right?

2615
01:54:32,190 --> 01:54:34,970
Yeah.
And that flag like that means something,

2616
01:54:35,210 --> 01:54:35,940
you know,
they,

2617
01:54:35,940 --> 01:54:40,440
it's not about right supremacy.
It's not always about Texas is a bad ass

2618
01:54:40,441 --> 01:54:41,920
place.
That's a bad ass flagged.

2619
01:54:42,390 --> 01:54:43,290
You have to have a mentor

2620
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:47,300
tality to live here and it's inclusive
mentality of your texts and your a text

2621
01:54:47,310 --> 01:54:49,500
and it doesn't matter if you're black or
way.

2622
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:50,730
Yeah,
I know.

2623
01:54:50,731 --> 01:54:52,460
They really had to let that go,
man.

2624
01:54:52,470 --> 01:54:55,290
The coming winter and you know,
what made me think that the.

2625
01:54:55,620 --> 01:55:00,510
I was always kind of back and forth on
the red skins and the Indians and uh,

2626
01:55:00,660 --> 01:55:03,480
know why pride is the thing.
It's just like what?

2627
01:55:03,481 --> 01:55:05,070
Because you and your grandfather used to

2628
01:55:05,390 --> 01:55:10,390
has poured and the warriors.
We used to go watch those games

2629
01:55:13,891 --> 01:55:15,820
together.
Me and my grandfather

2630
01:55:17,580 --> 01:55:19,350
made,
we can't be the red containing more of

2631
01:55:19,351 --> 01:55:20,700
where a few liberal,
but he's,

2632
01:55:20,970 --> 01:55:23,010
my friend get made a great point.
He said,

2633
01:55:23,550 --> 01:55:25,350
just as a businessman you

2634
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:27,860
say if you own the Redskins,
alright,

2635
01:55:28,010 --> 01:55:30,770
we're changing it.
All that old merge people are going to

2636
01:55:30,771 --> 01:55:33,920
be paying through the ass to get.
Then you have this new logo.

2637
01:55:33,950 --> 01:55:35,480
Everyone's going to be buying the new
stuff.

2638
01:55:35,830 --> 01:55:38,270
Just it's going to be a windfall just
from the merge.

2639
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:39,873
Just,
I mean if,

2640
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:41,000
if you,
if you're not,

2641
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:44,040
if you're not thinking about the social
issues of it as just a dollar

2642
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,560
issue and go for it,
people don't want to give up ground.

2643
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:49,830
Didn't make sense because they're
worried that crazy liberals are gonna

2644
01:55:49,831 --> 01:55:51,210
come in,
nerf everything.

2645
01:55:51,330 --> 01:55:53,670
It's not liberal.
It's just being nice.

2646
01:55:53,671 --> 01:55:55,350
Right?
I know in this case it is,

2647
01:55:55,351 --> 01:55:58,350
but it's one of the things that people
worry about that worry about giving up

2648
01:55:58,351 --> 01:56:00,540
ground because people were so ridiculous
today.

2649
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:03,210
They give up a little ground.
They'll go fucking crazy,

2650
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:08,310
no more taco Tuesdays,
cultural appropriation and can't serve

2651
01:56:08,311 --> 01:56:09,630
Sushi if you're.
Yes,

2652
01:56:10,410 --> 01:56:12,660
I know people just start getting really
wacky.

2653
01:56:12,661 --> 01:56:14,490
Will come till even up ground.
This is appealing.

2654
01:56:14,491 --> 01:56:16,180
It's running out of steam.
A little guess.

2655
01:56:16,290 --> 01:56:18,150
It feels like it's becoming more and
more preposterous.

2656
01:56:18,151 --> 01:56:21,750
Like being a social justice warrior is a
really ridiculous thing at this point.

2657
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:24,300
They really feels like it's become so
absurd.

2658
01:56:24,630 --> 01:56:26,310
Yeah,
I mean it's not from that.

2659
01:56:26,310 --> 01:56:28,290
I think there's a correction that's been
made.

2660
01:56:28,291 --> 01:56:31,740
I think there are people like taking
more things into consideration about

2661
01:56:31,741 --> 01:56:33,570
other people and now we didn't really
think about,

2662
01:56:33,690 --> 01:56:35,580
oh yeah,
for sure those families or with that

2663
01:56:35,581 --> 01:56:37,890
group or whatever,
but yeah,

2664
01:56:38,010 --> 01:56:39,050
it's been done.
Yeah,

2665
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:40,530
I mean,
but that's how it always is.

2666
01:56:40,531 --> 01:56:42,540
The tide goes out,
the tide goes and you can't explain it.

2667
01:56:42,650 --> 01:56:43,670
Yeah.
Now.

2668
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:44,460
Right?
Right.

2669
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:45,293
Bill O'reilly.
Yep.

2670
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:47,160
No,
we don't remember that.

2671
01:56:47,170 --> 01:56:47,600
No,
no.

2672
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:49,570
I was one of the worst arguments he ever
had on the show.

2673
01:56:49,571 --> 01:56:53,340
It was talking about how he's putting
his chips on Jesus because you can't

2674
01:56:53,341 --> 01:56:55,140
explain why the tie goes in.
The tide goes out.

2675
01:56:55,141 --> 01:56:57,600
He was talking to some guy who was an
atheist who is a docket.

2676
01:56:57,601 --> 01:56:58,810
Two doctrines.
No,

2677
01:56:59,090 --> 01:57:03,810
it wasn't dockets.
David Silverman was so dumb and dumb

2678
01:57:03,811 --> 01:57:04,790
argument and he said,
no,

2679
01:57:05,310 --> 01:57:06,870
you can't explain it,
but you can't explain it.

2680
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:08,810
Of course you hear you hear it.

2681
01:57:08,900 --> 01:57:10,810
So stupid.
That's a scam.

2682
01:57:10,890 --> 01:57:11,810
No,
I don't know.

2683
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:14,720
I'll tell you why.
I'll tell you why.

2684
01:57:14,721 --> 01:57:16,970
It's not a scam in my opinion.
Right.

2685
01:57:17,150 --> 01:57:18,460
Tide goes in,
tide goes out,

2686
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:21,410
never miscommunication.
You can't explain that.

2687
01:57:21,590 --> 01:57:24,560
You can explain why the tide goes in,
goes in,

2688
01:57:24,561 --> 01:57:25,640
tide,
goes to the water,

2689
01:57:25,641 --> 01:57:28,640
the tide comes in and it goes out.
Mr Silverman.

2690
01:57:28,950 --> 01:57:31,900
He always comes in on top of Mount
Olympus who's making the time.

2691
01:57:34,360 --> 01:57:36,940
That's great.
The look in his eyes like.

2692
01:57:36,941 --> 01:57:38,340
Yeah,
I can explain that though.

2693
01:57:38,380 --> 01:57:43,380
What the fuck you talking about?
That there's gravity causes the weight.

2694
01:57:44,110 --> 01:57:45,840
Come on man.
It's terrible.

2695
01:57:45,860 --> 01:57:47,710
You can time the tide.
You fuck.

2696
01:57:48,340 --> 01:57:51,490
I know exactly when it's coming.
It's such a bummer being smart

2697
01:57:51,491 --> 01:57:52,520
sometimes.
It's a bummer.

2698
01:57:52,521 --> 01:57:54,250
It takes away.
He's not dumb.

2699
01:57:54,251 --> 01:57:56,350
I think he's deceptive.
Like bill route.

2700
01:57:56,351 --> 01:57:59,170
It's just crazy.
It's amazing that he got kicked out of

2701
01:57:59,171 --> 01:58:00,340
Fox.
It's amazing.

2702
01:58:00,370 --> 01:58:03,430
They kicking everybody out.
Hannity seems to be holding on.

2703
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:06,860
Maybe he's like one of the.
The orgies.

2704
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:09,280
Yeah,
but you don't have enough dirt on them

2705
01:58:09,281 --> 01:58:12,940
selling crazy fuck party over there.
All they're doing is trying to get laid.

2706
01:58:13,730 --> 01:58:16,540
I feel rallies beaten off on the phone.
I read some article about it.

2707
01:58:16,541 --> 01:58:18,990
He'd call women up and it'd be beaten
off and he's talking to them like,

2708
01:58:19,030 --> 01:58:20,530
whoa.
Remember when the transcript came out

2709
01:58:20,531 --> 01:58:22,520
and he was like,
I want to be the Loofa on your body.

2710
01:58:22,860 --> 01:58:26,470
Yeah,
Snow workplace boy,

2711
01:58:28,300 --> 01:58:30,040
disgusting,
but what?

2712
01:58:30,041 --> 01:58:31,270
But odd,
right?

2713
01:58:31,300 --> 01:58:32,880
Yeah.
You know,

2714
01:58:33,610 --> 01:58:37,750
I know that that whole place was running
like it was like the cosby thing.

2715
01:58:37,751 --> 01:58:40,840
It's like once the one came out it was
just rapid fire.

2716
01:58:40,900 --> 01:58:41,733
Yup.

2717
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:44,830
Well,
when you have a guy who's got that kind

2718
01:58:44,831 --> 01:58:47,590
of power and is that,
you know,

2719
01:58:48,070 --> 01:58:50,580
it's just so weird.
Yeah.

2720
01:58:50,590 --> 01:58:53,980
They get bored.
Again,

2721
01:58:53,981 --> 01:58:55,600
the weird sexuality thing,
right?

2722
01:58:55,601 --> 01:59:00,601
It's like it manifests itself in this
guy in this way and it's abusing these

2723
01:59:01,331 --> 01:59:03,370
women,
those fucking shows too.

2724
01:59:03,850 --> 01:59:06,550
Like all these shows,
like when we really think back,

2725
01:59:07,030 --> 01:59:11,530
like we look back at 2017 from the
future and we look at the state of the

2726
01:59:11,531 --> 01:59:16,531
media today and how like one side,
whether it's Fox News or whether it's

2727
01:59:17,381 --> 01:59:21,010
CNN,
we so heavily leaned in one direction or

2728
01:59:21,011 --> 01:59:23,530
the other.
So obviously editorializing what's going

2729
01:59:23,531 --> 01:59:25,060
on the news and their opinions of the
news.

2730
01:59:25,270 --> 01:59:27,100
Well,
it's all just entertainment at this

2731
01:59:27,101 --> 01:59:28,090
point.
So gross.

2732
01:59:28,091 --> 01:59:29,680
I mean,
you know when that horrible thing

2733
01:59:29,681 --> 01:59:33,190
happened in Manchester at the,
at the concert,

2734
01:59:33,820 --> 01:59:34,391
it's like,
okay,

2735
01:59:34,391 --> 01:59:37,750
that act is heinous and what happened
that night to those people is heinous,

2736
01:59:38,170 --> 01:59:43,150
but then who does the all of the other
work of scaring the daylights out of the

2737
01:59:43,151 --> 01:59:44,110
rest of the world.

2738
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:49,500
CNN running it nonstop for 48 hours,
this grainy footage of young girls

2739
01:59:50,971 --> 01:59:54,850
screaming and crying,
so much more powerful than what that

2740
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:58,390
schmuck did.
Blowing up those people in that place

2741
01:59:58,840 --> 02:00:03,840
there.
They're just as negative of force for

2742
02:00:04,481 --> 02:00:06,670
the public.
Then the terrorists,

2743
02:00:06,820 --> 02:00:08,950
but they don't care.
They're just trying to get attention.

2744
02:00:08,980 --> 02:00:10,330
They just want you to.
It bleeds.

2745
02:00:10,331 --> 02:00:12,340
It leads.
That's a big story.

2746
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:15,220
Horrible know that people,
but what is their responsibility and

2747
02:00:15,221 --> 02:00:17,890
their responsibility to report on the
news because that's a new story.

2748
02:00:17,891 --> 02:00:19,480
That's a giant,
crazy,

2749
02:00:19,481 --> 02:00:23,320
tragic event.
It would be remiss if they didn't report

2750
02:00:23,321 --> 02:00:23,710
on it,
right?

2751
02:00:23,710 --> 02:00:27,130
You can report on it,
but you don't have to have me walking

2752
02:00:27,131 --> 02:00:30,580
with my daughter through an airport and
having it blaring out of every

2753
02:00:30,581 --> 02:00:32,950
television set.
The girls screaming.

2754
02:00:33,070 --> 02:00:36,130
You could have grown up sitting there
and analyzing it without

2755
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:39,010
sensationalizing it,
but it's entertainment.

2756
02:00:39,190 --> 02:00:42,430
It's this big balls out entertainment
network.

2757
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:45,820
It's heinous.
I think that's a real good argument.

2758
02:00:45,821 --> 02:00:47,980
The when people Washington voluntarily,
like at the.

2759
02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:49,710
At the airport scape it.
Yeah.

2760
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:52,420
I cannot escape it.
I was trying.

2761
02:00:52,421 --> 02:00:55,330
I was working on this book.
I was at the end of this book.

2762
02:00:55,340 --> 02:00:57,430
Had a deadline.
I'm just head down,

2763
02:00:57,940 --> 02:01:01,930
not trying to follow anything,
but I was traveling at the same time.

2764
02:01:02,230 --> 02:01:06,580
Wolf Blitzer is popping out in bars,
in restaurants at the gate.

2765
02:01:07,180 --> 02:01:09,970
Wetzels pretzels,
more breaking news.

2766
02:01:10,030 --> 02:01:14,260
Trump did this.
Now knowing that you can't escape it.

2767
02:01:14,440 --> 02:01:17,770
So much pressure.
There's no responsibility about these.

2768
02:01:17,860 --> 02:01:19,900
Like you know,
being an old man,

2769
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:22,810
be an old.
What happened to like the news reporters

2770
02:01:23,110 --> 02:01:28,110
being like a shitty guy,
but just delivered the news as the

2771
02:01:28,301 --> 02:01:33,301
grandfather with the news third running
ads now and CNN have them like Wolf

2772
02:01:34,330 --> 02:01:36,210
Blitzer and another couple of them
walking through the hall.

2773
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:40,010
It's like those espn ads on espn would.
They'd be

2774
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:43,220
walking through the net who?
The officers of espn making jokes with a

2775
02:01:43,221 --> 02:01:47,780
mascot.
That's what Wolf Blitzer and cow bell

2776
02:01:47,781 --> 02:01:52,580
and all these people are doing on CNN.
It's like they're walking through and

2777
02:01:52,581 --> 02:01:53,361
they're like,
hey,

2778
02:01:53,361 --> 02:01:54,950
look,
there's Anderson Cooper.

2779
02:01:54,951 --> 02:01:57,170
What's he doing in the office?
And it's a comedy bit.

2780
02:01:57,740 --> 02:02:00,020
Yes.
These are the people that are supposed

2781
02:02:00,021 --> 02:02:03,290
to be delivering the hard news.
Tell me rationalize and make sense of

2782
02:02:03,291 --> 02:02:04,370
the world.
Hey,

2783
02:02:04,371 --> 02:02:05,450
look at him.
He's in there.

2784
02:02:05,540 --> 02:02:08,120
What's the Anderson doing in there?
And a punchline?

2785
02:02:09,750 --> 02:02:11,180
Well,
you know what really disturbs me when

2786
02:02:11,181 --> 02:02:14,840
they do that podcast thing or Anderson
Cooper does that threesixty where he

2787
02:02:14,841 --> 02:02:18,520
sitting in the desk and allow for people
to is right for people to his left one

2788
02:02:18,530 --> 02:02:20,120
people.
There's nine people.

2789
02:02:20,121 --> 02:02:23,690
The last time I saw nine people yelling
at each other people and everyone's

2790
02:02:23,691 --> 02:02:25,050
talking over each other.
Right?

2791
02:02:25,130 --> 02:02:28,880
And some people never get a word in edge
wise and people are just jumping in and

2792
02:02:28,881 --> 02:02:30,860
it's just.
It's the worst.

2793
02:02:31,130 --> 02:02:32,570
It's all entertainment.
Yeah.

2794
02:02:32,571 --> 02:02:34,910
It's.
But it's also Edra editorialize too.

2795
02:02:35,180 --> 02:02:40,180
It's like how can a person just relayed
to you the information as unbiased as

2796
02:02:40,311 --> 02:02:41,720
they possibly can?
I know.

2797
02:02:41,780 --> 02:02:46,780
Is that possible today because pbs,
pbs is as close as I can find it.

2798
02:02:48,051 --> 02:02:50,090
Yes.
It's kind of just factual.

2799
02:02:50,150 --> 02:02:53,570
They just put it out whenever they have.
They have shields and Brooks on.

2800
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:55,490
It's a snap.
Brooks and Dunn.

2801
02:02:55,580 --> 02:02:59,270
It's now Cheryl's in your now it's a and
they just.

2802
02:02:59,271 --> 02:03:03,740
Two guys who would never be on any other
network is they're funny looking and

2803
02:03:03,741 --> 02:03:08,210
they have the conservative view in the
liberal view and but it's very matter of

2804
02:03:08,211 --> 02:03:11,930
fact and factual and not sensational.
Not shitty to each other.

2805
02:03:12,610 --> 02:03:15,860
It's.
It's is evenly balanced.

2806
02:03:15,861 --> 02:03:18,680
Calm as I can find.
His PBS news hour,

2807
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:23,920
who is Sean Hannity arguing with when he
was telling Sean Hannity that he's bad

2808
02:03:24,411 --> 02:03:27,760
for America was a Ted Koppel.
Ted Koppel's.

2809
02:03:27,770 --> 02:03:32,770
Ted Koppel told me it was bad for
American and saying something along the

2810
02:03:33,651 --> 02:03:35,480
lines of,
don't you think America smart enough to

2811
02:03:35,481 --> 02:03:37,430
make up their own mind,
which is just so ridiculous.

2812
02:03:37,450 --> 02:03:39,620
Well,
so candy ass of him is that he backs out

2813
02:03:39,621 --> 02:03:40,760
of it and says,
well,

2814
02:03:40,761 --> 02:03:43,430
I'm not a journalist.
I'm a talk show host,

2815
02:03:43,460 --> 02:03:44,293
mirror those.

2816
02:03:45,550 --> 02:03:48,230
You think we're bad for America.
You think I'm bad for America?

2817
02:03:48,231 --> 02:03:49,190
Yeah,
you do.

2818
02:03:49,310 --> 02:03:53,750
In the in the long haul,
I think on all these opinions,

2819
02:03:54,060 --> 02:03:54,950
ted.
No.

2820
02:03:54,970 --> 02:03:58,550
You know what's sad?
Because you're very good at what you do

2821
02:03:58,551 --> 02:04:01,910
and because you have,
you have attractive,

2822
02:04:03,170 --> 02:04:06,560
a significantly more generic.
Let me finish.

2823
02:04:07,190 --> 02:04:11,120
Let me finish the set
with all you.

2824
02:04:11,650 --> 02:04:13,880
Yes.
You have attracted

2825
02:04:15,830 --> 02:04:20,830
people who are determined that ideology
is more important than facts.

2826
02:04:22,710 --> 02:04:25,720
Oh,
that's what you need.

2827
02:04:25,721 --> 02:04:28,450
Those old dudes should be really tells
Joe Riley,

2828
02:04:28,451 --> 02:04:31,730
he ruined journalism to Ted Koppel's on
a goddamn rampage.

2829
02:04:32,340 --> 02:04:33,760
The loofa sponge.
Bitch.

2830
02:04:33,790 --> 02:04:37,860
I got something to say.
I've interviewed him a number of times.

2831
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:40,590
Not An easy interview.
How would you do it?

2832
02:04:41,680 --> 02:04:43,760
You know,
some and I have talked about this

2833
02:04:43,761 --> 02:04:48,380
general subject and many times over the
years it's irrelevant how I would do it.

2834
02:04:48,860 --> 02:04:49,880
And uh,
you know,

2835
02:04:49,881 --> 02:04:51,890
who made it irrelevant.
You do.

2836
02:04:52,940 --> 02:04:56,810
You have changed the television
landscape over the past 20 years.

2837
02:04:56,811 --> 02:05:01,040
You took it from being objective and
being subjective and entertaining.

2838
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:04,610
And in this current climate,
it doesn't matter what the interviewer

2839
02:05:04,611 --> 02:05:07,550
asks him,
Mr Trump was going to say whatever he

2840
02:05:07,551 --> 02:05:10,880
wants to say it,
as outrageous as it may be.

2841
02:05:11,200 --> 02:05:12,340
Okay.
But you know,

2842
02:05:12,341 --> 02:05:15,670
your old network,
ABC does interview Mr Trump on a regular

2843
02:05:15,671 --> 02:05:18,310
basis and you know,
our job,

2844
02:05:18,311 --> 02:05:22,780
whether I'm a commentator or a reporter,
is to get as much information,

2845
02:05:22,781 --> 02:05:26,470
number one,
and to show the viewer who the person

2846
02:05:26,471 --> 02:05:27,430
really is.
So again,

2847
02:05:27,431 --> 02:05:31,350
I'll go back to he sitting on nightline,
your opposed,

2848
02:05:31,570 --> 02:05:34,240
right opposite him.
How do you do it?

2849
02:05:35,100 --> 02:05:37,380
Well,
the first way you do it is nothing in

2850
02:05:37,381 --> 02:05:39,720
the end if you do it,
but some reporting,

2851
02:05:39,970 --> 02:05:44,310
it's an old fashioned concept.
Another think demonstrating who and what

2852
02:05:44,311 --> 02:05:49,311
Mr Trump is and what his various
policies really amount to a something

2853
02:05:49,471 --> 02:05:52,230
you don't do in an interview.
He doesn't answer the questions

2854
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:54,620
pointed out.
It's a whole different ballgame on

2855
02:05:54,621 --> 02:05:57,290
cable.
TV commentators like me have just ruined

2856
02:05:57,291 --> 02:05:59,930
the country I copped to that.
It's true,

2857
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:01,670
right?
I've ruined everything.

2858
02:06:03,540 --> 02:06:04,740
It's true.
It's entertainment.

2859
02:06:04,770 --> 02:06:06,880
Like just give us the news,
but there's,

2860
02:06:06,930 --> 02:06:08,490
you know,
there's so much money in it.

2861
02:06:08,491 --> 02:06:10,050
And it's sort of been,
why did they have to.

2862
02:06:10,410 --> 02:06:12,780
Here's the question,
why can't they just put on an

2863
02:06:12,781 --> 02:06:17,010
entertaining show that makes money?
Like whose responsibility is it to relay

2864
02:06:17,011 --> 02:06:19,710
the news to the people?
Is it Fox News responsibility?

2865
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:23,670
I mean,
don't they have some sort of an out that

2866
02:06:23,671 --> 02:06:25,620
they're an entertainment program?
Yeah,

2867
02:06:25,621 --> 02:06:27,060
but they're not.
What are they?

2868
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:29,090
What are they?
What is it?

2869
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:32,640
Let's say you decide,
I understand,

2870
02:06:32,910 --> 02:06:37,740
but let's say you decided to call the a
show the Tom Papa News and you start

2871
02:06:37,860 --> 02:06:42,860
talking about the news,
like do you have a very specific need to

2872
02:06:42,991 --> 02:06:46,110
like if we know you as an entertainer.
And Bill O'reilly was always an

2873
02:06:46,111 --> 02:06:48,750
entertainer.
He was a entertainment news reporter on

2874
02:06:48,751 --> 02:06:51,420
hard copy before he was ever on,
on this.

2875
02:06:51,810 --> 02:06:52,740
Right?
So we know he's.

2876
02:06:52,741 --> 02:06:56,160
That guy did.
Would you have a responsible who has a

2877
02:06:56,161 --> 02:06:59,460
responsibility to tell the news in an
objective sense?

2878
02:06:59,461 --> 02:07:03,120
Like if you can editorialize,
you can write things out and you can

2879
02:07:03,121 --> 02:07:05,490
decide which stories should get the most
coverage.

2880
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:08,790
During the campaign,
CNN was all about the sexual harassment

2881
02:07:08,791 --> 02:07:12,120
cases against trump.
And then Fox News was all about hillary

2882
02:07:12,121 --> 02:07:13,640
and her email scandal.
I mean they were,

2883
02:07:13,740 --> 02:07:15,800
they just decided once I was going to
go,

2884
02:07:15,870 --> 02:07:18,780
like,
who's to say what you can and can't do

2885
02:07:18,781 --> 02:07:21,450
when it comes to that.
We don't really have like a hard fast

2886
02:07:21,451 --> 02:07:23,850
rule when it comes to television
journalism.

2887
02:07:24,170 --> 02:07:27,300
I mean we think New York times we think,
you know,

2888
02:07:27,580 --> 02:07:30,930
in certain news papers that have a
great,

2889
02:07:31,300 --> 02:07:32,550
you know,
we have respect for them.

2890
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:36,100
They have a certain amount of fact
checking and

2891
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:38,950
reliability,
responsibility rather you can reliably

2892
02:07:39,220 --> 02:07:40,630
assess that this is going to be the
news,

2893
02:07:40,660 --> 02:07:42,310
right?
To a certain extent.

2894
02:07:42,460 --> 02:07:44,110
Yeah.
I think it's,

2895
02:07:44,111 --> 02:07:44,944
you know,
it's,

2896
02:07:44,980 --> 02:07:49,980
once you start a 24 hour news station,
it's a beast.

2897
02:07:51,670 --> 02:07:53,680
It's got to be fed.
And how do you keep those people

2898
02:07:53,681 --> 02:07:54,150
attracted

2899
02:07:54,150 --> 02:07:56,220
but isn't even really a 24 hour news
station.

2900
02:07:56,221 --> 02:07:59,430
When you think about what CNN is,
they have w Kamau bell show,

2901
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:01,590
right?
They have Anthony Bourdain's show.

2902
02:08:01,650 --> 02:08:04,240
They used to have that Tim ferriss show.
They've got a bunch of shows that have

2903
02:08:04,630 --> 02:08:07,530
Morgan spurlock show nothing to do with
news.

2904
02:08:07,531 --> 02:08:09,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

2905
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:09,930
I mean,
other than,

2906
02:08:10,370 --> 02:08:12,180
you know,
you haven't seen the show before,

2907
02:08:12,660 --> 02:08:15,000
this is new,
like they might be talking about some

2908
02:08:15,001 --> 02:08:16,650
information you might not have heard
before,

2909
02:08:16,651 --> 02:08:19,200
but it's not like breaking news show

2910
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:21,100
I think.
I think that,

2911
02:08:21,610 --> 02:08:23,260
I mean,
what does CNN stands for?

2912
02:08:23,590 --> 02:08:26,320
Cable News Network and Fox News.
I think once,

2913
02:08:26,321 --> 02:08:29,140
people,
once you know that people are looking to

2914
02:08:29,170 --> 02:08:32,830
you as the news,
there should be some responsibility.

2915
02:08:32,831 --> 02:08:35,620
I think that there's somebody,
some grownup has to be,

2916
02:08:36,580 --> 02:08:37,750
you know,
in control of that.

2917
02:08:37,751 --> 02:08:39,250
But you know,
these are stocks,

2918
02:08:39,400 --> 02:08:40,120
you know,
these are,

2919
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:45,120
these are parts of giant corporations
with stock prices and the people running

2920
02:08:45,461 --> 02:08:49,480
it.
I'm going to meetings and get raked over

2921
02:08:49,481 --> 02:08:52,900
the coals when their ratings are down.
And what are you going to do about it?

2922
02:08:53,140 --> 02:08:53,973
Jeff Zucker.

2923
02:08:54,020 --> 02:08:59,020
Maybe it's going to be like when wwe f
had to change her name to ww II.

2924
02:09:00,170 --> 02:09:03,060
So there'll be c and e.
yeah.

2925
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:05,061
Yeah.
I mean,

2926
02:09:05,061 --> 02:09:07,250
look,
if you put an old man news station on

2927
02:09:07,550 --> 02:09:09,230
right,
and we'd be like,

2928
02:09:09,231 --> 02:09:12,710
okay,
finally this is like all measured in all

2929
02:09:12,711 --> 02:09:17,711
sides and this is America first before
party it probably deep dog shit ratings.

2930
02:09:18,680 --> 02:09:20,870
You know what I mean?
Because it doesn't have all the other

2931
02:09:20,871 --> 02:09:23,240
people going crazy on it.
Yeah.

2932
02:09:23,300 --> 02:09:24,920
You know,
it's just,

2933
02:09:25,370 --> 02:09:29,270
you just hope that a little kind of
muddle through it and end up.

2934
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:31,460
It just won't grownups in charge.

2935
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:34,800
What's the dude?
The CNN,

2936
02:09:34,830 --> 02:09:36,660
the dude,
a Gq guy that's in his basement.

2937
02:09:36,661 --> 02:09:39,210
Again,
the resistance.

2938
02:09:39,211 --> 02:09:43,770
Keith Olbermann
is kind of put that dude on TV.

2939
02:09:44,850 --> 02:09:47,670
Comedy Central.
Just let him write his own shit.

2940
02:09:48,180 --> 02:09:51,900
I saw like a clip of him,
like it really looks like it's on a

2941
02:09:51,901 --> 02:09:55,020
cable news network somewhere.
It doesn't have a makeup person anymore.

2942
02:09:55,910 --> 02:10:00,910
I just had to make desks and these
incredibly verbose speeches and

2943
02:10:01,250 --> 02:10:04,370
assaulting trump over and over again
saying so cool.

2944
02:10:04,570 --> 02:10:07,440
When they were sold out to the Russians
and this was an invasion,

2945
02:10:07,441 --> 02:10:09,300
make no mistake about it.
We are the resistance.

2946
02:10:09,950 --> 02:10:11,790
Super intense.
Yeah,

2947
02:10:11,791 --> 02:10:14,010
I know,
but it's got that weird cable access.

2948
02:10:14,011 --> 02:10:15,240
Feel to it.
It really does.

2949
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:17,060
He's.
He used to be like,

2950
02:10:17,070 --> 02:10:19,830
with all these people around,
now he's down to printing his own pages,

2951
02:10:20,860 --> 02:10:22,740
coal,
landing his own scripts.

2952
02:10:25,070 --> 02:10:27,600
Somebody.
Somebody tweeted about it the other day

2953
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:30,240
about what a fucking nut here is.
Oh really?

2954
02:10:30,241 --> 02:10:33,030
I didn't know.
I hadn't been paying attention.

2955
02:10:33,410 --> 02:10:35,030
It's hard to find.
Well,

2956
02:10:35,031 --> 02:10:35,970
he's not.
I mean he's,

2957
02:10:36,010 --> 02:10:38,540
he's out there on the Gq page.
Yeah.

2958
02:10:38,750 --> 02:10:40,520
I don't know what they're doing.
Just coming in.

2959
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:43,490
Yeah.
My dog has the emergency room.

2960
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:44,840
What did they say?
Is it a snake bite?

2961
02:10:44,970 --> 02:10:48,590
A Bella can come home between 4:30 and
six.

2962
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:49,513
Well,
that's good.

2963
02:10:50,450 --> 02:10:53,210
So she knows that we're on the air so
she doesn't want to disturb,

2964
02:10:53,211 --> 02:10:55,190
but I want to find out what it was.
Yeah.

2965
02:10:55,640 --> 02:10:58,010
I hope it wasn't a snake bite.
Snake Venom.

2966
02:10:58,011 --> 02:10:59,780
As expensive as the snake.
Antidote.

2967
02:11:00,050 --> 02:11:02,150
Very expensive.
So if you're on the trail,

2968
02:11:02,151 --> 02:11:05,030
like I was in the and the and the snake
bit,

2969
02:11:05,031 --> 02:11:06,400
you in the leg,
your.

2970
02:11:06,540 --> 02:11:08,510
I find that out.
What do you do?

2971
02:11:08,510 --> 02:11:10,100
It's a good question.
That could happen to us.

2972
02:11:10,190 --> 02:11:14,120
That's one of the things we really
should know to went over a snake once I

2973
02:11:14,121 --> 02:11:16,940
was running with my dog,
a snake.

2974
02:11:17,060 --> 02:11:19,060
Now this one I didn't run over like hit.
Yeah.

2975
02:11:19,100 --> 02:11:24,100
This one I just saw in the road I was
running and I jumped over this stick and

2976
02:11:24,561 --> 02:11:27,270
as I was jumping over the stick,
I realized there was a rattle snake,

2977
02:11:28,070 --> 02:11:31,460
really big one.
Stretched out who flattened out on the

2978
02:11:31,461 --> 02:11:33,880
road on the trail.
Completely flattened out,

2979
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:35,150
and it was,
you know,

2980
02:11:35,300 --> 02:11:36,950
the length of my arms.
Yeah,

2981
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:38,590
it was.
It was a big ass fucking snakes.

2982
02:11:38,591 --> 02:11:42,380
Snakes thick like my wrist around.
It was a fucking thick old snake.

2983
02:11:42,620 --> 02:11:44,420
So that's a lot of venom that would come
out of that head.

2984
02:11:44,510 --> 02:11:47,480
I guess I've heard of.
I don't know if it's a myth or not,

2985
02:11:47,481 --> 02:11:49,910
but I heard that the young ones are
actually more dangerous because they

2986
02:11:49,911 --> 02:11:51,140
unload all their venom.

2987
02:11:51,260 --> 02:11:53,330
Whereas the older ones just give you a
little zap.

2988
02:11:53,700 --> 02:11:55,370
The old ones like,
dude,

2989
02:11:55,371 --> 02:11:57,540
relax.
They're smart.

2990
02:11:57,710 --> 02:11:59,510
Keep the snake bite victim,
victim,

2991
02:11:59,511 --> 02:12:01,310
calm,
keeping them still and quiet.

2992
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:06,470
Restrict movement and keep the effected
area at or below heart level to reduce

2993
02:12:06,471 --> 02:12:09,890
the flow of venom.
Remove any rings or constricting items

2994
02:12:09,891 --> 02:12:12,110
and clothing as the effected area may
swell.

2995
02:12:12,111 --> 02:12:15,520
Allow the bite to bleed freely for 15 to
30 seconds before cleansing.

2996
02:12:15,950 --> 02:12:18,620
Create a loose splint to help restrict
the movement of the area.

2997
02:12:18,621 --> 02:12:20,480
Contact medical help as soon as
possible.

2998
02:12:20,481 --> 02:12:22,880
See below.
Evacuate the victim immediately by

2999
02:12:22,881 --> 02:12:26,090
hiking to a car,
a helicopter or medical staff.

3000
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:28,070
Monitor the person's vital signs,
temperature,

3001
02:12:28,071 --> 02:12:30,920
pulse rate of breathing,
and blood pressure if possible.

3002
02:12:31,220 --> 02:12:34,220
But does it say you do so?
So number six,

3003
02:12:34,221 --> 02:12:37,160
evacuate the victim immediately by
hiking to a car.

3004
02:12:37,910 --> 02:12:41,100
So does that mean that the person has
been baking?

3005
02:12:41,120 --> 02:12:43,520
Hold on a second.
Would it do not waste time hunting for

3006
02:12:43,521 --> 02:12:47,930
the snake and did not risk another bite.
If it's not easy to kill the snake while

3007
02:12:47,931 --> 02:12:50,450
they're trying to tell you to kill it,
after it has been killed,

3008
02:12:50,451 --> 02:12:53,030
a snake can still bite for up to an
hour.

3009
02:12:53,031 --> 02:12:55,970
So be careful what transporting it.
Holy Shit,

3010
02:12:56,840 --> 02:12:59,510
that's scary.
But that's kind.

3011
02:12:59,550 --> 02:13:00,530
They're Kinda like saying,
look,

3012
02:13:00,531 --> 02:13:03,560
I know you're going to kill this fucking
snake if I looked it up for a hiking

3013
02:13:03,580 --> 02:13:06,800
because a job and you're in a house,
it's given you other information

3014
02:13:07,400 --> 02:13:09,450
specific for a hike.
Still doesn't save.

3015
02:13:09,470 --> 02:13:12,260
You should move or not.
Definitely says you're supposed to stay

3016
02:13:12,261 --> 02:13:14,780
still,
but if you have to walk a mile to your

3017
02:13:14,781 --> 02:13:15,950
house.
Yeah.

3018
02:13:15,951 --> 02:13:17,240
Uphill.
Yeah.

3019
02:13:17,310 --> 02:13:20,570
You got to go.
I guess the splint is aloof splint to

3020
02:13:20,571 --> 02:13:23,810
help restrict google.
What do you do if you get bit by a snake

3021
02:13:23,811 --> 02:13:26,000
and you're hiking alone?
A lot of words.

3022
02:13:26,660 --> 02:13:27,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

3023
02:13:28,610 --> 02:13:30,830
My dog is uh,
we have no information.

3024
02:13:30,831 --> 02:13:32,070
The doctor will tell us when we get

3025
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:32,950
there.
Interesting.

3026
02:13:33,360 --> 02:13:36,720
What it's need to know basis.
What does that have to show your papers?

3027
02:13:36,721 --> 02:13:38,040
First.
Fence of the worst.

3028
02:13:39,120 --> 02:13:40,830
My glass cat that died.
It was like,

3029
02:13:41,220 --> 02:13:42,870
we don't know.
We're going to have to run a test.

3030
02:13:43,050 --> 02:13:43,711
Okay,
fine.

3031
02:13:43,711 --> 02:13:45,630
Run the test.
It's going to be $1,500.

3032
02:13:45,660 --> 02:13:46,493
Okay.
Granted,

3033
02:13:47,310 --> 02:13:48,480
$1,500.
Okay.

3034
02:13:48,481 --> 02:13:50,130
That didn't come.
It's inconclusive.

3035
02:13:50,131 --> 02:13:52,570
We're gonna have to run another test.
Oh,

3036
02:13:53,150 --> 02:13:54,210
why?
Oh,

3037
02:13:54,730 --> 02:13:58,290
if you want to try and save it,
we're going to be up to three grand.

3038
02:13:58,720 --> 02:14:01,530
All right.
We're on the test and then right now

3039
02:14:01,531 --> 02:14:04,200
we're three grand in the hole.
We didn't find out.

3040
02:14:04,290 --> 02:14:08,940
There's no way to cure it.
They put the cat down and then they say,

3041
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,850
do you want us to do an autopsy?
Why?

3042
02:14:11,910 --> 02:14:12,743
Sure.
Why?

3043
02:14:13,030 --> 02:14:14,320
Why can you do one on the moon?

3044
02:14:19,770 --> 02:14:21,360
Snake questions on Reddit.
Okay.

3045
02:14:21,361 --> 02:14:22,230
No.
First Aid,

3046
02:14:22,250 --> 02:14:23,970
it is much better than performing bad
for.

3047
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:24,811
Oh,
no.

3048
02:14:24,811 --> 02:14:27,540
First date is much better than
performing bad first aid.

3049
02:14:27,900 --> 02:14:30,270
Don't cut at or around the site of the
bite.

3050
02:14:30,271 --> 02:14:33,150
Don't compress the bitten limb with a
cord or a tight bandage.

3051
02:14:33,151 --> 02:14:38,151
Don't attempt to extract or neutralize
venom using electricity fire permit

3052
02:14:38,431 --> 02:14:42,450
grant program at granite and that says
permission granted,

3053
02:14:42,470 --> 02:14:45,570
hermine granted permission granted salt.
What is that?

3054
02:14:46,890 --> 02:14:50,730
Like an orange blackstone's,
more mouths mud leaves,

3055
02:14:50,740 --> 02:14:54,180
etc. All snake bite kits are dangerous
and should not be used.

3056
02:14:54,210 --> 02:14:57,000
Wow.
This wAs also confirmed by the snake

3057
02:14:57,210 --> 02:15:01,210
snake bite poison line.
A lot of snake bite patients injured

3058
02:15:01,220 --> 02:15:05,760
themselves by panicking directly after a
snake bite by tripping over a rock or a

3059
02:15:05,761 --> 02:15:06,680
tree trunk.
Oh,

3060
02:15:06,690 --> 02:15:08,580
by falling off the cliff side of the
trail.

3061
02:15:08,581 --> 02:15:11,310
Staying calm is important.
After snake bite,

3062
02:15:11,580 --> 02:15:14,190
walk about 20 to 30 feet away from the
snake.

3063
02:15:14,220 --> 02:15:16,980
Find a safe,
safe place to sit down asap.

3064
02:15:17,220 --> 02:15:20,100
The venom can rapidly diffuse into your
system.

3065
02:15:20,820 --> 02:15:24,510
This can drop your blood pressure too
low to pump all the way to your head

3066
02:15:24,511 --> 02:15:25,800
while standing.
Whoa,

3067
02:15:26,100 --> 02:15:29,670
sitting down reduces your chances of
feigning within the first few minutes.

3068
02:15:29,671 --> 02:15:32,640
If you faint,
shouldn't be more for more than a few

3069
02:15:32,640 --> 02:15:34,520
minutes,
remove any race,

3070
02:15:34,590 --> 02:15:35,850
any rings,
watches,

3071
02:15:35,851 --> 02:15:38,310
or tight clothing while it's going to
swell up.

3072
02:15:38,370 --> 02:15:40,140
Yeah.
Anything else from the benton limb?

3073
02:15:40,141 --> 02:15:41,550
Because of swelling,
we will make a lot,

3074
02:15:41,620 --> 02:15:44,580
a lot bigger as soon.
Take five minutes to calm down and plan

3075
02:15:44,581 --> 02:15:48,030
your evacuation.
The only effective treatment for a snake

3076
02:15:48,060 --> 02:15:51,900
bite,
even animation is the right antivenom to

3077
02:15:51,901 --> 02:15:54,690
neutralize it,
to not Wait for symptoms to appear.

3078
02:15:54,691 --> 02:15:58,230
If bitten is important to get in touch
the emergency personnel as soon as

3079
02:15:58,231 --> 02:16:01,890
possible to get you to a hospital.
If you have a cell phone and service,

3080
02:16:02,220 --> 02:16:03,240
great call nine,
one,

3081
02:16:03,241 --> 02:16:04,410
one,
or the park ranger.

3082
02:16:04,411 --> 02:16:07,080
If there's no service.
Think about the last time you had fallen

3083
02:16:07,600 --> 02:16:08,360
phones,
man,

3084
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:10,280
that we didn't have a cell phone.
That was the other thing.

3085
02:16:11,140 --> 02:16:11,811
I was like,
no,

3086
02:16:11,811 --> 02:16:12,950
we're going to disconnect.

3087
02:16:13,590 --> 02:16:15,480
Look at this.
You're supposed to circle the location,

3088
02:16:15,481 --> 02:16:19,050
the snake bite and write down the time
next to it so when they find you dead.

3089
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:19,780
Yeah,
draw.

3090
02:16:19,780 --> 02:16:23,340
Circle around the border of the swelling
and write down the time.

3091
02:16:23,610 --> 02:16:26,370
Write down all the things you're
experiencing that are not normal.

3092
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:29,790
So now we have pens on us.
You know we have markers and

3093
02:16:30,560 --> 02:16:33,040
examples are metallic.
Taste in your mouth.

3094
02:16:33,070 --> 02:16:36,010
Changes to sense of smell,
sudden loss of vision,

3095
02:16:36,100 --> 02:16:38,440
double vision,
visual disturbances,

3096
02:16:38,820 --> 02:16:40,420
ringing in the ears,
headaches,

3097
02:16:40,440 --> 02:16:42,980
nausea and vomiting,
bleeding from anywhere,

3098
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:44,710
dizziness,
shortness of breath,

3099
02:16:44,711 --> 02:16:47,050
etc. It's bad.
That's not good.

3100
02:16:47,260 --> 02:16:49,010
Oh,
down there and make contact via cell

3101
02:16:49,011 --> 02:16:50,770
phone.
If this is not possible,

3102
02:16:50,771 --> 02:16:53,200
walk slowly to get help.
That's the key.

3103
02:16:53,230 --> 02:16:55,930
Drink some water and take some calories.
If you have any.

3104
02:16:56,680 --> 02:17:00,610
Some snakebite victims walk several
miles after serious snake bites to their

3105
02:17:00,611 --> 02:17:01,131
legs.
Oh,

3106
02:17:01,131 --> 02:17:01,961
okay.
Okay.

3107
02:17:01,961 --> 02:17:04,630
They make it out to medical care.
Yeah.

3108
02:17:04,690 --> 02:17:07,590
You hike out.
Don't be messy,

3109
02:17:07,720 --> 02:17:08,590
man.
The fuck up.

3110
02:17:08,591 --> 02:17:10,700
You killed that kind of a snake.
That evil.

3111
02:17:11,190 --> 02:17:13,390
Look at serpent.
How did you kill it?

3112
02:17:13,990 --> 02:17:16,000
You just stomped on.
It stomped on his head.

3113
02:17:16,660 --> 02:17:17,870
His heAd?
Yeah.

3114
02:17:17,980 --> 02:17:21,280
That's where the body part comes from.
If you're faster than the body part.

3115
02:17:24,610 --> 02:17:28,690
I got a good sidekick.
You are not wearing flip flops?

3116
02:17:28,730 --> 02:17:29,351
No.
No.

3117
02:17:29,351 --> 02:17:31,330
I was wearing.
I think I was running a trail.

3118
02:17:31,331 --> 02:17:32,350
Sneakers.
oh,

3119
02:17:32,830 --> 02:17:34,870
it got a little something to him.
A little grip.

3120
02:17:36,360 --> 02:17:37,840
You shouldn't do it.
I wouldn't recommend it.

3121
02:17:37,930 --> 02:17:40,060
I would probably never do it again,
but in the moment it was the thing to

3122
02:17:40,061 --> 02:17:40,871
do.
I like that.

3123
02:17:40,871 --> 02:17:42,550
That you just thought,
I have a shot here.

3124
02:17:42,551 --> 02:17:45,180
I'm going to take it is predatory
instincts.

3125
02:17:45,181 --> 02:17:46,990
I was like,
this mother fucker sleeping on me.

3126
02:17:48,400 --> 02:17:51,440
He does not think I'm going to stop him.
I have to stop them.

3127
02:17:52,110 --> 02:17:53,800
This is good.
Memorial weekend stuff,

3128
02:17:53,870 --> 02:17:56,830
things to bring on your trail,
a phone and a sharpie.

3129
02:17:57,410 --> 02:17:58,750
Well,
I always have that with me in case

3130
02:17:58,751 --> 02:18:00,600
people want autographs.
it's a good move.

3131
02:18:02,020 --> 02:18:03,550
I'm thinking about getting some snake
boots.

3132
02:18:03,580 --> 02:18:05,170
jamie.
Pull up snake boots because I've been

3133
02:18:05,280 --> 02:18:06,460
looking at some snake boots.

3134
02:18:06,490 --> 02:18:08,140
If their thigh high,
I'm walking out.

3135
02:18:08,320 --> 02:18:10,780
I will stop the fuck out of every snake
I see.

3136
02:18:11,080 --> 02:18:14,500
If I get some sky high wonder woman's
style.

3137
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:17,200
hey tom,
you want to come stomping this weekend?

3138
02:18:17,910 --> 02:18:22,780
We're going snow snake boots.
If it gets you right above that and you

3139
02:18:22,781 --> 02:18:24,610
feel like such a fucking idiot because
you're walking

3140
02:18:27,490 --> 02:18:29,950
up to your knee,
what are those cowboy boot looking ones

3141
02:18:29,951 --> 02:18:32,430
with the red.
Are those like kevlar on the side of

3142
02:18:32,431 --> 02:18:33,520
them?
Click on that bitch.

3143
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:37,080
Keep it ship a chippewa,
but I could see with knight,

3144
02:18:37,090 --> 02:18:41,050
with a big red hat himself,
a girl on a farmer's only.com.

3145
02:18:48,990 --> 02:18:53,260
I don't know what to do if I get bit by
a snake oil knows how to catch a bass.

3146
02:18:53,980 --> 02:18:58,980
This 17 inch boot has a brown leather
foot and co dura top to allow for

3147
02:18:59,561 --> 02:19:02,090
breeding.
There's also a goodyear leather welt.

3148
02:19:02,380 --> 02:19:03,610
What's a welt?
The bottom,

3149
02:19:03,670 --> 02:19:06,430
I guess,
cushion in souls and leather line.

3150
02:19:06,431 --> 02:19:08,950
Don't get caught by a snake without a
pair.

3151
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:14,680
The leader in snake proof boot business,
she's become the standard of quality and

3152
02:19:14,681 --> 02:19:19,681
durability that will support the hunter
in reptile infested areas.

3153
02:19:20,050 --> 02:19:20,950
Merry christmas,
honey.

3154
02:19:20,980 --> 02:19:25,980
I got you something.
Most of the time they probably just bite

3155
02:19:26,171 --> 02:19:28,670
straight ahead at these things.
Probably work.

3156
02:19:28,760 --> 02:19:30,120
Yeah.
Got a bad one.

3157
02:19:30,290 --> 02:19:34,040
Where these people live that they need
frequent scott over the knees.

3158
02:19:34,041 --> 02:19:37,670
Snake proof boots has got snake proofs
to levels that look like a snake.

3159
02:19:37,671 --> 02:19:40,370
That's just vicious.
Are you looking for a blow job in a bass

3160
02:19:40,371 --> 02:19:42,230
boat?
farmers?

3161
02:19:42,560 --> 02:19:43,420
Yeah.

3162
02:19:48,760 --> 02:19:52,640
Like could you imagine wearing those
stupid looking boots and that fucking

3163
02:19:52,641 --> 02:19:56,360
snake lunged forward and you saw the
teeth like this client is going to get

3164
02:19:56,361 --> 02:20:00,990
me right above the boot and bambi locks
onto your kneecap and fills it up with

3165
02:20:01,300 --> 02:20:03,380
them.
You have to look in his fucking

3166
02:20:03,381 --> 02:20:06,350
reptilian.
Ancient eyes is a heartless,

3167
02:20:06,351 --> 02:20:11,351
soulless eyes as he pumps is toxin into
your bloodstream and you're still

3168
02:20:11,541 --> 02:20:14,900
wearing those stupid boots.
you're looking for a hand job in a

3169
02:20:14,901 --> 02:20:15,734
motorboat.

3170
02:20:19,630 --> 02:20:22,970
Yeah.
How much sex has ever had happened in

3171
02:20:22,971 --> 02:20:25,610
those?
Those boats in Florida with a fan?

3172
02:20:26,230 --> 02:20:29,760
The giant fans.
They'll get that bite him.

3173
02:20:30,140 --> 02:20:30,970
Bite.
Yeah.

3174
02:20:30,970 --> 02:20:32,320
That was a cool,
but where?

3175
02:20:32,490 --> 02:20:34,760
Where are these people hiking?
All the time that they see so many

3176
02:20:34,761 --> 02:20:38,840
rattlers dude.
Here you go up in the hills right above

3177
02:20:38,841 --> 02:20:39,651
the studio,
man.

3178
02:20:39,651 --> 02:20:41,240
There's fucking snakes all over the
place.

3179
02:20:41,270 --> 02:20:45,170
The point of wearing these boots,
if you're a guy who has to do it all the

3180
02:20:45,171 --> 02:20:47,840
time,
if you're a person that's up there all

3181
02:20:47,841 --> 02:20:49,790
the time,
I would recommend them like,

3182
02:20:49,791 --> 02:20:50,690
okay,
let's find out.

3183
02:20:50,780 --> 02:20:53,450
Where do most people get bitten by
snakes.

3184
02:20:54,350 --> 02:20:57,200
What part of the body to most people get
build parts of the body.

3185
02:20:57,201 --> 02:20:58,760
Yeah.
I thought your fucking city.

3186
02:20:58,761 --> 02:21:00,650
No,
I was going to say st.

3187
02:21:03,410 --> 02:21:05,030
Yeah,
I bet.

3188
02:21:05,031 --> 02:21:06,530
It's a bet.
It's the.

3189
02:21:06,650 --> 02:21:09,680
The calf,
the calf area.

3190
02:21:09,681 --> 02:21:10,810
Shin,
calf area.

3191
02:21:10,820 --> 02:21:11,630
It makes sense,
right?

3192
02:21:11,630 --> 02:21:13,280
You're looking for a hand job in a
haystack

3193
02:21:15,450 --> 02:21:19,460
is greater than 90 percent happened on
the leg and the leg.

3194
02:21:19,461 --> 02:21:20,420
Yeah,
they're lOw.

3195
02:21:20,421 --> 02:21:22,790
They're in grand creatures.
They're not flying around.

3196
02:21:22,820 --> 02:21:25,070
What if you have good moy tai and you
have good leg checks?

3197
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:27,430
You get those knees up high.
I think common.

3198
02:21:27,440 --> 02:21:28,580
You check it.
Yeah,

3199
02:21:29,240 --> 02:21:31,130
I bet.
I bet none of those guys have gotten hit

3200
02:21:31,131 --> 02:21:32,390
by a snake,
but none of them.

3201
02:21:32,391 --> 02:21:34,970
They're fast snake.
They're not.

3202
02:21:35,060 --> 02:21:36,350
You know,
they're not that quick.

3203
02:21:36,400 --> 02:21:38,750
There's sprinkle problem as if you.
If you start alum.

3204
02:21:39,080 --> 02:21:41,030
Yeah.
That's where it's really fucked up.

3205
02:21:41,031 --> 02:21:42,680
If you startle them,
they have to.

3206
02:21:42,780 --> 02:21:45,530
What I did,
the thing about a snake is that they

3207
02:21:45,531 --> 02:21:47,750
have to come up in order to get you.

3208
02:21:48,300 --> 02:21:51,470
So if a snake is flat like that,
like the snake that I saw,

3209
02:21:51,471 --> 02:21:53,000
he was flat and I was like,
oh,

3210
02:21:53,001 --> 02:21:55,370
you're dead.
Like you're not gonna be able to get up

3211
02:21:55,371 --> 02:21:56,930
quick enough.
Mine was coiled.

3212
02:21:57,840 --> 02:21:58,520
Mmm.
This is.

3213
02:21:58,520 --> 02:22:00,950
They have a,
what they call a strike height and they

3214
02:22:00,951 --> 02:22:04,160
can make it above some other boots.
Some people are asking about if they can

3215
02:22:04,161 --> 02:22:07,400
get kevlar jeans so that they don't go
through their genes.

3216
02:22:07,650 --> 02:22:09,080
That's a good move.
So they don't really.

3217
02:22:09,230 --> 02:22:12,320
You don't have to wear a snake proof
underpants.

3218
02:22:12,860 --> 02:22:17,860
I want a snake proof condom,
maybe steel James Michael analysis,

3219
02:22:18,170 --> 02:22:21,590
talking about it.
Does it probably help guide the venom

3220
02:22:22,220 --> 02:22:26,430
right into your fucking leg.
Act as like a hill slide

3221
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:29,370
you want to do,
do it doggy style or the blue collar

3222
02:22:29,371 --> 02:22:30,204
concert,

3223
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:33,380
the state fair
state fair

3224
02:22:35,270 --> 02:22:37,810
state fairs or odd man.
They're really weird.

3225
02:22:37,811 --> 02:22:39,170
Weirdly,
abandon the State fair.

3226
02:22:40,040 --> 02:22:41,600
Even if there's a lot of people at the
state fair,

3227
02:22:41,640 --> 02:22:43,700
you.
The caveat is that as a state fair,

3228
02:22:45,750 --> 02:22:48,500
the state fair,
I go to see ted nugent at the state

3229
02:22:48,501 --> 02:22:49,820
fair.
I packed

3230
02:22:52,400 --> 02:22:55,880
contents here.
You know,

3231
02:22:56,110 --> 02:22:59,260
I once got an offer when I was first
starting as a comic to do,

3232
02:22:59,330 --> 02:23:01,810
uh,
the offer was get a,

3233
02:23:01,870 --> 02:23:06,870
you would drive a van with all this
stuff for the stage in it to the state

3234
02:23:07,751 --> 02:23:09,040
fair.
Help,

3235
02:23:09,250 --> 02:23:11,350
help the crew,
build the stage,

3236
02:23:11,351 --> 02:23:12,910
load everything onto the stage and
stuff.

3237
02:23:13,360 --> 02:23:15,610
And then you drive at the end of the
show,

3238
02:23:15,670 --> 02:23:16,930
you know,
you do a little comedy,

3239
02:23:16,990 --> 02:23:19,380
hosts little,
and then you drive to the next,

3240
02:23:19,610 --> 02:23:21,040
breakdown the stage,
load it up.

3241
02:23:21,070 --> 02:23:23,940
Then you drive to the next city.
And the routing was like,

3242
02:23:24,490 --> 02:23:28,360
starts in buffalo next night in phoenix
next night.

3243
02:23:28,361 --> 02:23:29,470
Charlotte,
North Carolina,

3244
02:23:29,860 --> 02:23:32,860
then rochester,
then back to tucson,

3245
02:23:32,861 --> 02:23:34,150
Arizona.
I was like,

3246
02:23:34,151 --> 02:23:36,070
I said to my girlfriend at the time,
who's now my wife.

3247
02:23:36,071 --> 02:23:40,590
We should just get on the motorcycle and
just drive all these places without the

3248
02:23:40,870 --> 02:23:42,660
state fair shows.
Yeah,

3249
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:44,610
that's what we did.
Yeah.

3250
02:23:44,620 --> 02:23:47,110
And then they pay you,
but it was not much right now is

3251
02:23:47,111 --> 02:23:48,820
terrible.
So we ended up.

3252
02:23:48,821 --> 02:23:50,950
ThAt's what we did.
We took the motorcycle and went for five

3253
02:23:50,951 --> 02:23:53,470
weeks just to go around the u.
S motorcycle.

3254
02:23:53,490 --> 02:23:54,670
Yeah.
That's a pretty gangster.

3255
02:23:54,970 --> 02:23:57,580
Who was gangster.
We'd only been dating for like six

3256
02:23:57,581 --> 02:23:58,480
months.
A show

3257
02:23:58,820 --> 02:23:59,980
you care.
That's.

3258
02:23:59,981 --> 02:24:00,890
Yeah.
That's a good show.

3259
02:24:00,891 --> 02:24:02,920
A galleria care move.
You're really invested.

3260
02:24:02,990 --> 02:24:04,930
That's what we got trip with her.
Got back from that.

3261
02:24:04,931 --> 02:24:05,621
We were like,
all right,

3262
02:24:05,621 --> 02:24:07,720
I guess we'll get married because that
went well.

3263
02:24:07,780 --> 02:24:10,060
That's bill murray's advice.
Bill murray says,

3264
02:24:10,061 --> 02:24:12,010
if you're thinking about married,
someone travel the world with them.

3265
02:24:12,160 --> 02:24:14,110
Yeah.
He'll be hot and miserable.

3266
02:24:14,111 --> 02:24:15,280
You find out what they're really all
about.

3267
02:24:15,530 --> 02:24:17,630
Absolutely.
I've lost some friends.

3268
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:19,800
We went on vacations with berlin.
Yeah,

3269
02:24:20,220 --> 02:24:21,110
the fall apart on you.
Yeah.

3270
02:24:21,111 --> 02:24:22,940
They get shitty.
They can't go with the flow.

3271
02:24:23,290 --> 02:24:24,380
They get all pissy,
you know,

3272
02:24:24,381 --> 02:24:29,381
because the car didn't show up or you
missed the train and you know,

3273
02:24:29,960 --> 02:24:31,310
it's a little stressful when you travel.

3274
02:24:31,570 --> 02:24:32,950
Yeah.
That is a problem with some people,

3275
02:24:32,951 --> 02:24:34,990
right?
Just don't know how to keep it together

3276
02:24:34,991 --> 02:24:38,020
when things aren't going the best.
They're pissy.

3277
02:24:38,280 --> 02:24:38,780
Yeah,

3278
02:24:38,780 --> 02:24:39,611
bet.
Bet hannity,

3279
02:24:39,611 --> 02:24:41,560
moe move when he's like,
really 10.

3280
02:24:41,620 --> 02:24:43,930
Really that sad.
That guy.

3281
02:24:44,230 --> 02:24:46,150
You don't want to travel with that guy.
He's silly.

3282
02:24:46,151 --> 02:24:48,460
Boy.
You just get pissy that kind of like the

3283
02:24:48,461 --> 02:24:49,930
kid who's been picked on kind of thing,

3284
02:24:50,060 --> 02:24:52,990
but you know what the problem with those
guys is as many problems,

3285
02:24:53,200 --> 02:24:55,480
but one of the big problems is they're
always in combat.

3286
02:24:56,070 --> 02:24:56,940
They're always,
always fight,

3287
02:24:56,980 --> 02:25:00,160
always forcing their opinions.
They're always pushing their opinions

3288
02:25:00,161 --> 02:25:04,300
with a lot of energy and emphasis and
they're always resisting anything that

3289
02:25:04,301 --> 02:25:06,910
is contrary to their opinions.
Never considering them.

3290
02:25:07,300 --> 02:25:09,450
Never going over it like,
yeah.

3291
02:25:09,550 --> 02:25:12,750
Really objectively.
It's always this,

3292
02:25:12,751 --> 02:25:14,690
this interview,
which is a natural,

3293
02:25:14,930 --> 02:25:18,160
not natural knee jerk reaction that all
oF us are subject to.

3294
02:25:18,250 --> 02:25:20,650
Yeah,
we're all subject to that kind of

3295
02:25:21,550 --> 02:25:25,420
unfortunate defense of our ideas.
Our initial idea,

3296
02:25:26,070 --> 02:25:28,620
there's a book,
I do not know the name,

3297
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:32,580
I'll find out and post it,
but that my friend read and he's a

3298
02:25:32,640 --> 02:25:36,600
conservative and it's basically about
that.

3299
02:25:36,690 --> 02:25:41,690
It's how to take here something,
recognize what your initial knee jerk

3300
02:25:41,701 --> 02:25:44,490
reaction is because of where you stand
on what you believe

3301
02:25:46,380 --> 02:25:49,710
and evaluate it and give yourself a beat
to say,

3302
02:25:49,711 --> 02:25:51,210
wait,
maybe I'm wrong,

3303
02:25:51,630 --> 02:25:53,580
and trying to work your way around the
argument.

3304
02:25:54,030 --> 02:25:55,830
And uh,
he's,

3305
02:25:56,160 --> 02:26:01,160
he really believes in this book.
It's like we're so all naturally set for

3306
02:26:01,231 --> 02:26:03,960
these trigger words.
Like you hear hannity or you hear trump

3307
02:26:03,961 --> 02:26:07,380
where you hear hillary,
where you hear the clintons and

3308
02:26:08,160 --> 02:26:11,220
everybody has their preconceived
beliefs.

3309
02:26:11,460 --> 02:26:14,490
So you just back up.
Whatever's those stories are in this

3310
02:26:14,491 --> 02:26:18,840
book is about breaking that down and
trying to be more open and more logical.

3311
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:23,800
I've definitely tried to work on that a
lot during my time that I've been doing

3312
02:26:23,801 --> 02:26:25,780
the podcast.
I've gotten way better at it.

3313
02:26:25,781 --> 02:26:27,350
I'm definitely not the best at it.
Yeah.

3314
02:26:27,430 --> 02:26:30,880
But it's something I'm way better at now
than I was when I first started doing

3315
02:26:30,881 --> 02:26:31,900
the podcast.
So yeah.

3316
02:26:32,080 --> 02:26:34,510
Yeah.
Because you realize like how much iT

3317
02:26:34,540 --> 02:26:39,070
gets in the way of a good conversation.
It gets in the way of understanding how

3318
02:26:39,071 --> 02:26:42,220
other people think and you know,
sometimes you have to dig your heels in

3319
02:26:42,221 --> 02:26:44,730
and defend your position because you
think the other person's being illogical

3320
02:26:45,160 --> 02:26:49,570
and that's okay too.
But I think it's also important to look

3321
02:26:49,571 --> 02:26:52,210
at what someone else is saying and try
to make,

3322
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:54,460
see if it makes any sense at all.
And it might not,

3323
02:26:54,970 --> 02:26:57,130
but give it a chance.
Give it a chance to give it a chance.

3324
02:26:57,131 --> 02:26:57,561
yeah,
no,

3325
02:26:57,561 --> 02:27:00,250
it's great.
I tried to look at someone from someone

3326
02:27:00,251 --> 02:27:01,360
else's point of view.
I try to go,

3327
02:27:01,361 --> 02:27:03,670
okay.
So where would explain it?

3328
02:27:03,710 --> 02:27:05,280
Like where are you coming from?
Like just try to.

3329
02:27:05,290 --> 02:27:07,500
I try to do it with no judgment.
I try to just like really

3330
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:09,430
get into bed.
So when you,

3331
02:27:09,670 --> 02:27:14,670
when you do take opinions and you do
analyze it and come down and say x is

3332
02:27:15,041 --> 02:27:16,450
wrong,
I believe x is wrong.

3333
02:27:16,870 --> 02:27:20,320
Do you
read your twitter feed?

3334
02:27:20,880 --> 02:27:23,920
Do you like.
Because it seems like anytime you're in

3335
02:27:23,921 --> 02:27:28,280
something public and you side anyway,
you know,

3336
02:27:28,390 --> 02:27:31,510
one issue and you go this way or that
way you're getting attacked.

3337
02:27:32,260 --> 02:27:33,160
Do you have That?

3338
02:27:33,430 --> 02:27:34,570
You would definitely have that.
Yeah,

3339
02:27:34,620 --> 02:27:36,940
I've got the end.
Do you take it to heart or you're just

3340
02:27:36,950 --> 02:27:37,271
like,
no,

3341
02:27:37,271 --> 02:27:39,160
these people just exist and that's just
the way.

3342
02:27:39,500 --> 02:27:42,260
I mean I analyze myself.
I mean I'll,

3343
02:27:42,261 --> 02:27:43,600
I'll listen to some of it.
Yeah,

3344
02:27:43,620 --> 02:27:44,770
if it's valid,
I know,

3345
02:27:44,771 --> 02:27:46,810
I definitely know I fucked up before.
Sure.

3346
02:27:46,840 --> 02:27:49,780
and when I have fucked up before I've
read things that people said that it

3347
02:27:49,781 --> 02:27:52,270
didn't feel good to read it,
but I knew that they were probably

3348
02:27:52,310 --> 02:27:54,020
right.
And so you just,

3349
02:27:54,460 --> 02:27:56,710
you know,
when you're doing a live show and you're

3350
02:27:57,010 --> 02:27:59,220
just kind of free balling the time and
it's.

3351
02:27:59,610 --> 02:28:02,650
And sometimes comedy and sometimes it's
just,

3352
02:28:02,680 --> 02:28:05,530
sometimes it gets heated,
sometimes there's booze involved in

3353
02:28:06,430 --> 02:28:07,830
lows,
but um,

3354
02:28:08,170 --> 02:28:09,490
you know,
I mean it's just,

3355
02:28:10,060 --> 02:28:12,130
are you trying to get better all the
time trying to do it better,

3356
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:12,370
right?

3357
02:28:12,370 --> 02:28:15,180
If you are,
this is just the part of the process and

3358
02:28:15,181 --> 02:28:17,890
um,
there's value in feedback,

3359
02:28:18,250 --> 02:28:22,670
but there's also you have to understand
like how many people would you know,

3360
02:28:22,940 --> 02:28:25,520
how many people are just trolling you,
how many people don't like you for

3361
02:28:25,521 --> 02:28:27,280
whatever reason,
how many people just go,

3362
02:28:27,290 --> 02:28:29,870
I've gone to people's pages,
they'll say something insulting and you

3363
02:28:29,871 --> 02:28:31,940
go to their page and it's just them
insulting everybody.

3364
02:28:32,470 --> 02:28:35,300
Anybody they can.
I know there's some people that choose

3365
02:28:35,301 --> 02:28:37,220
to do that with their time and hey,
this is America.

3366
02:28:37,221 --> 02:28:41,540
You're allowed to do that.
But I think overall the more time goes

3367
02:28:41,541 --> 02:28:44,450
on,
the less I spend looking at any of that

3368
02:28:44,451 --> 02:28:47,630
shit the better off I am.
So I'm less likely to look at that shit

3369
02:28:47,640 --> 02:28:49,040
now than I ever have before.
Yeah.

3370
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:51,150
It's just a.
Yeah,

3371
02:28:51,151 --> 02:28:54,720
because like you say,
like some of it you want to see.

3372
02:28:54,721 --> 02:28:56,490
And it is good feedback and like,
you know,

3373
02:28:56,491 --> 02:28:58,170
there is a good rapport like with,
you know,

3374
02:28:58,800 --> 02:29:03,090
and then other people just like,
they make it almost impossible to find

3375
02:29:03,091 --> 02:29:07,410
the good ones because it's just,
just because you said one word and look,

3376
02:29:07,860 --> 02:29:09,930
you know,
we're comedians were just curious.

3377
02:29:09,931 --> 02:29:11,640
People were always trying to figure
stuff out.

3378
02:29:12,090 --> 02:29:13,620
You know,
we're very similar in that we're not

3379
02:29:13,740 --> 02:29:16,410
down on neither any one side,
any one team.

3380
02:29:16,650 --> 02:29:20,040
We're really trying to figure out life
and try to figure things out.

3381
02:29:20,940 --> 02:29:24,000
So you're allowed to try and be like,
I don't think this is right or I don't

3382
02:29:24,001 --> 02:29:24,930
think that's right.
And then.

3383
02:29:25,110 --> 02:29:29,400
But the teams,
people from the teams just pounce.

3384
02:29:29,770 --> 02:29:30,750
Well,
you can't think that way.

3385
02:29:30,960 --> 02:29:32,640
Well,
I'm trying to figure it out.

3386
02:29:32,641 --> 02:29:35,760
I don't know if this is a,
an oil grab.

3387
02:29:35,761 --> 02:29:37,800
I don't know if this is,
but don't you think that's also what

3388
02:29:37,801 --> 02:29:38,290
makes,

3389
02:29:38,290 --> 02:29:40,730
um,
social in social media and interaction

3390
02:29:40,731 --> 02:29:43,670
with people so interesting is that
people can throw their opinion to the

3391
02:29:43,700 --> 02:29:45,830
ring,
throw their hat into the ring as a word.

3392
02:29:45,831 --> 02:29:46,291
You know,
like they,

3393
02:29:46,291 --> 02:29:50,060
they read something that you say or they
heard something that you said in a clip

3394
02:29:50,061 --> 02:29:51,410
and then they,
they argue with you about it.

3395
02:29:51,900 --> 02:29:53,110
If it's,
if it's,

3396
02:29:53,710 --> 02:29:54,543
if it's,
uh,

3397
02:29:55,700 --> 02:29:57,130
a smart argument.
yeah.

3398
02:29:57,550 --> 02:29:59,800
Not just a knee jerk,
you know,

3399
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:02,500
I hope you die because you said that.
You know what I mean?

3400
02:30:03,010 --> 02:30:04,420
You'd love to,
you know,

3401
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:06,850
I mean,
that's some of the best conversations

3402
02:30:06,851 --> 02:30:10,750
you can have or when you don't agree
with somebody and you're just kind of

3403
02:30:10,751 --> 02:30:12,580
like going back into cam,
get here,

3404
02:30:12,850 --> 02:30:14,220
but it's not insulting.
Yeah.

3405
02:30:14,240 --> 02:30:15,250
That's the big key.

3406
02:30:15,620 --> 02:30:18,830
And it's also you,
when you explore why you believe

3407
02:30:18,831 --> 02:30:21,740
something and I believe something
different and you go back and forth

3408
02:30:21,741 --> 02:30:23,720
over.
if you do do it respectful and you do

3409
02:30:23,721 --> 02:30:26,930
get to understand where that person's
coming from,

3410
02:30:27,350 --> 02:30:31,370
sometimes it makes it even more obvious
to everybody listening and to you that

3411
02:30:31,371 --> 02:30:36,371
they're wrong or that you're wrong.
Whatever the fucking honest answer is it

3412
02:30:36,711 --> 02:30:38,990
gets.
It gets sort of illuminated and it

3413
02:30:38,991 --> 02:30:41,630
doesn't get illuminated.
When you get locked up in this battle,

3414
02:30:42,060 --> 02:30:46,250
there's people that will form sides,
but if you can get to the objective bow

3415
02:30:46,251 --> 02:30:47,060
k,
what?

3416
02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:50,660
What makes you believe that that is true
and then they tell you and you go,

3417
02:30:50,661 --> 02:30:52,370
well,
that is actually not true.

3418
02:30:52,520 --> 02:30:55,010
Let's find the facts or I didn't know
that.

3419
02:30:55,310 --> 02:30:59,060
Now I'm looking at my initial position
different in life and don't be married

3420
02:30:59,061 --> 02:31:01,490
to that initial position because it's
just an opinion,

3421
02:31:01,760 --> 02:31:05,330
but opinions to us are almost like
markers of our self esteem.

3422
02:31:05,331 --> 02:31:09,200
If you can't,
if you can't defend that position,

3423
02:31:09,650 --> 02:31:12,310
then you fucked up initially and you're
in the year,

3424
02:31:12,311 --> 02:31:16,090
you're flawed so people like dig in and
they try to defend that position and

3425
02:31:16,091 --> 02:31:18,860
even when they know it logically,
it doesn't make sense.

3426
02:31:18,861 --> 02:31:20,100
It's like they get married to it

3427
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:22,770
and even if you.
You're with somebody and you're engaged

3428
02:31:22,771 --> 02:31:26,040
and you're having this real back and
forth about something and you both are

3429
02:31:26,041 --> 02:31:29,370
dealing with the facts,
but you still have your opinion that now

3430
02:31:29,371 --> 02:31:33,630
I'm still siding with this way and I'm
siding with that way you can still

3431
02:31:33,690 --> 02:31:34,820
respect each other.
Yeah.

3432
02:31:35,250 --> 02:31:38,700
It's when you go,
when it becomes this personal insult is

3433
02:31:38,701 --> 02:31:40,110
where you lose it,
right?

3434
02:31:40,111 --> 02:31:41,640
I mean,
I know people in my family,

3435
02:31:41,641 --> 02:31:43,770
people you know,
that I work with whatever,

3436
02:31:44,040 --> 02:31:46,920
who have total different views,
vote differently,

3437
02:31:46,921 --> 02:31:48,150
act differently,
do whatever,

3438
02:31:48,450 --> 02:31:51,570
but I love them.
They're just great people and you can't,

3439
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:54,630
they're to,
you shouldn't have to dissolve

3440
02:31:54,631 --> 02:31:58,620
relationships because of a political
point of view about a certain issue.

3441
02:31:59,110 --> 02:32:00,300
There's,
you know,

3442
02:32:00,600 --> 02:32:02,750
that's what's so great.
my whole family was like,

3443
02:32:03,090 --> 02:32:05,190
my grandfather was hard,
right?

3444
02:32:05,191 --> 02:32:07,500
My uncle was hard left and they would
argue and fight,

3445
02:32:07,740 --> 02:32:10,320
but they loved each other and everybody
kind of got along and just ate the

3446
02:32:10,321 --> 02:32:11,820
potatoes after the argument.

3447
02:32:12,390 --> 02:32:13,590
Some people can't do that.
Right?

3448
02:32:13,591 --> 02:32:15,060
So you can't,
if you don't agree with them,

3449
02:32:15,061 --> 02:32:16,560
you can't hang out with them.
Yeah,

3450
02:32:16,590 --> 02:32:17,970
like about everything.
Yeah.

3451
02:32:18,810 --> 02:32:21,450
And then some people will have like
these crazy arguments where you just

3452
02:32:21,600 --> 02:32:24,060
can't be right or wrong.
You don't know what you're talking about

3453
02:32:24,061 --> 02:32:27,900
and you're still like climate change.
How many people have you talked to that?

3454
02:32:27,901 --> 02:32:30,750
We'll just go hard one way or the other
on climate change.

3455
02:32:30,751 --> 02:32:32,940
Yeah.
And then when you start talking to them

3456
02:32:32,941 --> 02:32:34,590
about it,
like you actually ask them,

3457
02:32:34,591 --> 02:32:38,670
what makes you think that climate change
is just a cycle and that human beings

3458
02:32:38,671 --> 02:32:42,480
are not involved and it's been shown
that it's been a lot of the data has

3459
02:32:42,481 --> 02:32:45,150
been hoaxed and a lot of the.
And then if you just go deeper,

3460
02:32:45,151 --> 02:32:46,620
deeper,
deeper down the rabbit hole,

3461
02:32:46,621 --> 02:32:48,450
you find that they haven't looked into
it that much.

3462
02:32:48,480 --> 02:32:51,570
Right?
Very few people arguing pr pro or

3463
02:32:51,571 --> 02:32:54,660
against manmade climate change have
really looked into it.

3464
02:32:54,910 --> 02:32:58,830
Most people are just sort of taking the
consensus view that they hear from

3465
02:32:58,831 --> 02:33:00,940
scientists are from pundits or from
people.

3466
02:33:01,760 --> 02:33:04,260
And if you were on the left,
you're most likely thinking that we're

3467
02:33:04,261 --> 02:33:06,120
in deep trouble.
and if you're on the right,

3468
02:33:06,240 --> 02:33:07,950
you're more likely to dismiss it.
Yeah,

3469
02:33:08,220 --> 02:33:11,410
I mean that's why.
Back to why we need grownups to like

3470
02:33:11,430 --> 02:33:15,060
control some of the news and give you
facts so you can kind of decide stuff.

3471
02:33:15,061 --> 02:33:19,290
It's because you don't have the time to
research climate change on your own.

3472
02:33:19,291 --> 02:33:22,500
You've got kids,
you've got a dog that's got a wants you

3473
02:33:22,501 --> 02:33:25,620
to whack off with the two.
There's a lot going on in your life,

3474
02:33:25,650 --> 02:33:30,650
so you depend on others who are really,
who are invested in giving you the right

3475
02:33:30,781 --> 02:33:31,470
information.

3476
02:33:31,470 --> 02:33:34,890
So what do you do?
Do you tell them that they have to just

3477
02:33:34,891 --> 02:33:35,910
say like,
okay,

3478
02:33:35,911 --> 02:33:37,440
if you're going to call something in
news,

3479
02:33:37,441 --> 02:33:41,250
should we have like a thing where
there's a,

3480
02:33:41,320 --> 02:33:45,990
you have to like meet a standard of
ingredients like we looked at your

3481
02:33:45,991 --> 02:33:48,450
ingredients and you have trans fats in
your news,

3482
02:33:48,520 --> 02:33:50,580
right?
You have all this other bullshit like

3483
02:33:50,581 --> 02:33:52,020
this.
He can't sell this as food,

3484
02:33:52,830 --> 02:33:55,430
not news.
You can't make this fit should be.

3485
02:33:55,920 --> 02:33:58,680
It should be because like for,
for like hannity to say I'm a talk show

3486
02:33:58,681 --> 02:34:00,020
host,
that's fine.

3487
02:34:00,360 --> 02:34:02,880
More power to you,
but then there should be a thing,

3488
02:34:02,881 --> 02:34:06,960
a little logo in the corner that says
opinion show,

3489
02:34:06,990 --> 02:34:07,560
right?
The little.

3490
02:34:07,560 --> 02:34:09,990
oh,
and then there should be an n on the top

3491
02:34:09,991 --> 02:34:12,870
of the whatever show that just giving
you facts for the day.

3492
02:34:12,890 --> 02:34:15,360
Right?
The problem really is calling it a news

3493
02:34:15,361 --> 02:34:17,680
network and having an opinion.
People on a news network.

3494
02:34:17,681 --> 02:34:18,310
Right.

3495
02:34:18,310 --> 02:34:20,830
But that it's the same with anderson
cooper when he's rolling his eyes at

3496
02:34:20,831 --> 02:34:21,880
kellyanne conway.
Yeah,

3497
02:34:21,960 --> 02:34:24,010
the same shit.
It's the sAme stuff.

3498
02:34:24,150 --> 02:34:25,810
Same shit.
He's just do it on the other side and

3499
02:34:25,811 --> 02:34:28,450
maybe he's correct that what she's
saying is ridiculous,

3500
02:34:28,451 --> 02:34:30,640
but he's clearly editorializing by doing
that.

3501
02:34:30,650 --> 02:34:32,220
Yes.
It's all opinion shows,

3502
02:34:32,280 --> 02:34:35,250
you know,
and then you need buddy don lemon.

3503
02:34:35,280 --> 02:34:39,090
You meet an old ted koppel to just sit
there with his little face and just gave

3504
02:34:39,091 --> 02:34:43,590
you the boring news and put an n on it
and then he goes on an opinion shows he

3505
02:34:43,591 --> 02:34:44,700
lets them know.
Yeah.

3506
02:34:44,730 --> 02:34:45,960
I mean he's letting these guys know
like,

3507
02:34:45,961 --> 02:34:47,460
hey,
you're ruining everything.

3508
02:34:47,490 --> 02:34:49,950
Yeah.
There was enough time to watch anything

3509
02:34:50,130 --> 02:34:51,390
frankly.
Good for you.

3510
02:34:51,570 --> 02:34:54,630
But where do you get your news?
Do you just read articles I read?

3511
02:34:54,631 --> 02:34:55,500
Uh,
I,

3512
02:34:55,501 --> 02:34:57,620
yeah,
I mean stuff pops up on my phone,

3513
02:34:57,640 --> 02:34:58,980
read the times.
I read the times.

3514
02:34:58,981 --> 02:35:02,100
I got the times delivered every day.
Look at you like a real man.

3515
02:35:02,220 --> 02:35:04,920
Yeah.
To have toast gentleman's toast.

3516
02:35:04,980 --> 02:35:06,780
Yes,
I do the gentleman's breakfast

3517
02:35:06,781 --> 02:35:09,110
gentleman's breakfast and eat the van
gogh is this great.

3518
02:35:09,350 --> 02:35:14,350
A great painter has this great.
Had this great quote about what it takes

3519
02:35:15,361 --> 02:35:19,050
to do good work and you have to have a,
you have to have your,

3520
02:35:19,430 --> 02:35:20,370
your smoking,
your pipe,

3521
02:35:20,820 --> 02:35:23,370
have a uh,
a fling once in awhile,

3522
02:35:23,790 --> 02:35:28,790
something like a and have a moment to
yourself to have coffee,

3523
02:35:28,950 --> 02:35:33,570
to have your coffee by yourself.
And I really try and carve out every day

3524
02:35:33,690 --> 02:35:34,950
I have.
It's not going to make me van gogh,

3525
02:35:34,951 --> 02:35:37,770
but it just,
I really believe those things like to

3526
02:35:37,771 --> 02:35:41,610
just sit with your coffee for a couple
of minutes and just in peace.

3527
02:35:41,611 --> 02:35:42,510
Just have that.

3528
02:35:42,860 --> 02:35:45,140
Those moments like even when you're
talking about making your bread,

3529
02:35:45,250 --> 02:35:47,050
yeah,
those moments make you more of a person.

3530
02:35:47,060 --> 02:35:50,330
Those moments of thought and careful
consideration what you're doing,

3531
02:35:50,390 --> 02:35:51,230
relaxation,

3532
02:35:51,640 --> 02:35:54,940
you sitting there and eating the bread.
Just having a slice of toast and a

3533
02:35:54,941 --> 02:35:59,320
coffee and just sit for 10 minutes and
before you embark on whatever madness

3534
02:35:59,321 --> 02:36:00,580
you're going to do for the day,

3535
02:36:00,990 --> 02:36:02,490
that's one of those moments are
important.

3536
02:36:02,550 --> 02:36:07,500
It's one of the big rituals for back
country hunters bringing coffee guys

3537
02:36:07,501 --> 02:36:08,160
will,
you know,

3538
02:36:08,160 --> 02:36:12,030
weight is a very big thing.
Your back country hunting and hiking.

3539
02:36:12,060 --> 02:36:14,070
Like when these guys go deep into the
back country,

3540
02:36:14,100 --> 02:36:16,600
you know there are several miles deep
into the woods.

3541
02:36:16,601 --> 02:36:18,270
Yeah.
I used to do it all the time and they,

3542
02:36:18,510 --> 02:36:20,940
the guy,
a lot of guys will bring like a little

3543
02:36:20,941 --> 02:36:25,941
jet boil and packets of coffee and
they'll cook up some hot water and

3544
02:36:25,981 --> 02:36:27,750
they'll sit together and they'll,
well,

3545
02:36:27,751 --> 02:36:29,670
they'll like have a moment to be a
person again,

3546
02:36:29,970 --> 02:36:31,320
sit down,
let's have a cup of coffee.

3547
02:36:31,350 --> 02:36:32,460
Interesting.
And they'll,

3548
02:36:32,461 --> 02:36:34,740
they'll use these little plastic cups
and you know,

3549
02:36:34,741 --> 02:36:37,140
the poor have their coffee and they're
sitting there drinking the side of the

3550
02:36:37,141 --> 02:36:38,640
mountain and then they feel like,
oh,

3551
02:36:38,641 --> 02:36:41,190
I got a moment of pleasure,
a moment of relaxation.

3552
02:36:41,550 --> 02:36:43,200
And there's other stuff they didn't put
in the packs.

3553
02:36:43,201 --> 02:36:44,490
Just so they can have that.
Yes.

3554
02:36:44,760 --> 02:36:47,570
Well they just carry that extra weight.
Especially the jetboil jet poles,

3555
02:36:47,580 --> 02:36:49,190
probably compounder.
So you know,

3556
02:36:49,340 --> 02:36:52,320
you're carrying water anyway.
So you just boiling that water and you

3557
02:36:52,321 --> 02:36:53,150
pour in those,
you know,

3558
02:36:53,150 --> 02:36:56,370
they have those starbucks little virtue.
I think they're called.

3559
02:36:56,870 --> 02:37:00,000
One's called starbucks.
You have little packets called.

3560
02:37:00,420 --> 02:37:02,820
What's it called?
That was called [inaudible].

3561
02:37:03,010 --> 02:37:03,841
Yeah.
It's just like,

3562
02:37:03,841 --> 02:37:05,160
yeah,
like a little pack of like instant

3563
02:37:05,161 --> 02:37:07,300
coffee or anything.
It was a to what is a virtue that's

3564
02:37:07,320 --> 02:37:10,230
assumption right now that make
electronic or some shit.

3565
02:37:11,550 --> 02:37:13,020
But yeah,
whatever those star wars,

3566
02:37:13,040 --> 02:37:14,190
those,
those starburst.

3567
02:37:14,360 --> 02:37:16,130
So starbucks are really good.

3568
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:17,230
Those are good.
Yeah.

3569
02:37:17,400 --> 02:37:20,460
I mean it tastes like real coffee.
Make figured out how to do it now with

3570
02:37:20,650 --> 02:37:22,510
my shitty New York apartment because.
Yeah,

3571
02:37:22,800 --> 02:37:24,210
because they didn't have a good coffee
maker.

3572
02:37:24,211 --> 02:37:24,641
I was like,
these,

3573
02:37:24,641 --> 02:37:25,490
this will do me.
Well

3574
02:37:25,700 --> 02:37:27,050
dude,
if you want to make coffee,

3575
02:37:27,051 --> 02:37:29,540
if you're at home,
all you need is a french press.

3576
02:37:29,541 --> 02:37:32,570
That is the way that he has a way to go.
It is the best.

3577
02:37:32,600 --> 02:37:35,030
It's a little mucky cleanup.
Yeah.

3578
02:37:35,031 --> 02:37:38,120
I guess that's where it's at,
but it's a few steps,

3579
02:37:38,180 --> 02:37:42,950
but the oils from the coffee,
like if you're a person who enjoys the

3580
02:37:42,951 --> 02:37:45,380
actual flavor,
no milk,

3581
02:37:45,381 --> 02:37:48,710
no nothing.
Just give it to me like a man.

3582
02:37:48,711 --> 02:37:51,860
That's what I would drink it these days
and I get way less complaints on the

3583
02:37:51,861 --> 02:37:54,270
podcast about me clearing my throat.
Oh yeah.

3584
02:37:54,380 --> 02:37:55,640
That was a problem before.
Why?

3585
02:37:55,641 --> 02:37:58,880
Because you had stuff in the coffee.
I drink bulletproof coffee with butter

3586
02:37:58,881 --> 02:38:03,230
and mct oil and it was making you flemmi
that butter coffee makes you super

3587
02:38:03,231 --> 02:38:04,064
fleming.
That'd be like,

3588
02:38:04,340 --> 02:38:06,200
what am I drinking here?
Black coffee.

3589
02:38:06,230 --> 02:38:08,660
Just black man coffee.
The best sabretooth roast.

3590
02:38:08,730 --> 02:38:11,360
it's really good.
god damn savage was good.

3591
02:38:11,510 --> 02:38:13,880
Uh,
now there's those moments are really

3592
02:38:13,881 --> 02:38:17,240
important in life.
I really believe like those little quiet

3593
02:38:17,900 --> 02:38:20,900
things that have been passed on,
like if things had been around for

3594
02:38:20,901 --> 02:38:24,830
thousands of years and people have
figured it out the cocktail hour,

3595
02:38:25,100 --> 02:38:26,570
the moment,
the quiet moment,

3596
02:38:26,740 --> 02:38:29,500
you know,
before bed or in the morning when you're

3597
02:38:29,510 --> 02:38:31,880
having your coffee,
those things are figured out for a

3598
02:38:31,881 --> 02:38:35,130
reason.
There people have figured out this is

3599
02:38:35,150 --> 02:38:36,650
the way to live,
this is,

3600
02:38:37,250 --> 02:38:38,870
you know,
it really is.

3601
02:38:39,290 --> 02:38:40,820
It really is the way to live.
Yeah.

3602
02:38:40,821 --> 02:38:43,850
And if you could pull it off and they're
so small and they're so deep and they're

3603
02:38:43,851 --> 02:38:45,710
so valuable,
you know what I mean?

3604
02:38:45,860 --> 02:38:48,170
it's not a giant trip to vegas.
It's not,

3605
02:38:48,410 --> 02:38:50,600
oh,
I've got to make a million dollars.

3606
02:38:50,960 --> 02:38:53,630
It's sitting with your pipe and a
coffee.

3607
02:38:54,020 --> 02:38:58,340
that simple little thing.
so much better for your soul.

3608
02:38:58,520 --> 02:39:03,520
Then all this giant stuff that we end up
chasing small.

3609
02:39:04,710 --> 02:39:05,810
Yeah.
Um,

3610
02:39:06,180 --> 02:39:09,960
I was uh,
interviewing dr robert sapolsky

3611
02:39:09,961 --> 02:39:13,080
yesterday,
famous scientist and one of the things I

3612
02:39:13,081 --> 02:39:15,390
was doing is going over some of his
work,

3613
02:39:15,720 --> 02:39:18,960
listening to some of his previous
interviews and reading some of his

3614
02:39:18,961 --> 02:39:22,140
articles and stuff.
And he had this thing about meditation.

3615
02:39:22,380 --> 02:39:23,640
Oh yeah.
And essentially one of the things that

3616
02:39:23,641 --> 02:39:26,550
we're saying about meditation is like,
it can be effective,

3617
02:39:26,551 --> 02:39:29,850
but you have to do it all the time.
Like it's not something you can do once

3618
02:39:29,851 --> 02:39:31,650
a week.
Like meditation is something that should

3619
02:39:31,651 --> 02:39:34,500
become a daily part of your routine.
Then you can,

3620
02:39:34,501 --> 02:39:37,410
it'll help you mitigate stress,
but I think it's twice a day.

3621
02:39:37,900 --> 02:39:39,600
once a day.
He didn't specify,

3622
02:39:39,990 --> 02:39:41,190
you know,
he's talking about all the different

3623
02:39:41,191 --> 02:39:43,680
forms that it takes to.
There's a bunch of different kinds and

3624
02:39:43,681 --> 02:39:47,150
there's not necessarily one that works
best one,

3625
02:39:47,370 --> 02:39:49,410
but I think that what you're doing when
you're making your bread,

3626
02:39:49,411 --> 02:39:51,180
I think that's a meditation.
I really do.

3627
02:39:51,460 --> 02:39:52,960
Yeah.
In a weird way.

3628
02:39:53,680 --> 02:39:57,520
It's not like when I really meditate and
you sit for 20 minutes and you don't

3629
02:39:57,521 --> 02:39:59,350
slow,
like it slows your heart rate,

3630
02:39:59,351 --> 02:40:00,970
it says,
and you're not asleep.

3631
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:04,030
It actually calms you deeper than sleep.

3632
02:40:04,670 --> 02:40:07,370
I used to and I still do call martial
arts,

3633
02:40:07,371 --> 02:40:12,230
moving meditation because martial arts
make you think so much about the

3634
02:40:12,231 --> 02:40:14,100
movements and about what you're doing.
So

3635
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:18,150
much inTensity and so much danger
involved in them that they make you have

3636
02:40:18,151 --> 02:40:21,930
like very singular focus and then in
that singular focus there's some sort of

3637
02:40:21,931 --> 02:40:26,931
a cleansing that happens with your mind
by just going hard at these things.

3638
02:40:28,351 --> 02:40:33,351
It relieves stress in a way completely
that uber focus on anything.

3639
02:40:33,451 --> 02:40:34,500
Right?
Like when I used to,

3640
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:39,360
when I had a motorcycle and my father
still does it and you know,

3641
02:40:39,410 --> 02:40:40,990
I mean it's his thing like,
you know,

3642
02:40:40,991 --> 02:40:44,430
I've comedy and other things to put my
mind into,

3643
02:40:45,420 --> 02:40:47,130
but he still does it and I get it.
I mean,

3644
02:40:47,131 --> 02:40:49,170
when you're on that bike,
it's your survival.

3645
02:40:49,200 --> 02:40:52,080
Where's your dad live?
He lives in New York city?

3646
02:40:52,170 --> 02:40:53,003
No.
Uh,

3647
02:40:53,010 --> 02:40:55,140
upstate New York.
So is he in a place where you could ride

3648
02:40:55,141 --> 02:40:56,670
a bike and not worry about?
Yeah.

3649
02:40:56,730 --> 02:40:59,960
It's not like running you over whether
texting,

3650
02:40:59,990 --> 02:41:00,870
but he goes everywhere.

3651
02:41:00,870 --> 02:41:02,580
He goes on these trips,
like,

3652
02:41:03,180 --> 02:41:06,090
excuse me,
up all the way in mostly east coast,

3653
02:41:06,091 --> 02:41:07,950
but he's done all of europe.
He's done all of the.

3654
02:41:07,960 --> 02:41:10,120
You ever wipe out?
No,

3655
02:41:10,230 --> 02:41:11,940
they never wiped out.
Never wiped out.

3656
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:13,090
Wow.
No,

3657
02:41:13,260 --> 02:41:14,520
that's incredible.
Yeah.

3658
02:41:14,850 --> 02:41:17,530
How'd you do that?
You're the only guy I've ever heard of a

3659
02:41:17,560 --> 02:41:18,750
really?
I don't know.

3660
02:41:18,990 --> 02:41:22,710
I was uber safe as you know,
as I could be,

3661
02:41:22,711 --> 02:41:24,360
you know,
you're still dependent on other people,

3662
02:41:24,361 --> 02:41:29,361
but the only time I fell over was my
wife and I pulled into a days inn in

3663
02:41:31,021 --> 02:41:33,510
like Kansas and we'd done a lot of
highway,

3664
02:41:33,511 --> 02:41:34,690
just straight,
you know,

3665
02:41:35,820 --> 02:41:40,770
hours just going and we pulled up to the
days inn and the routine was we'd pull

3666
02:41:40,771 --> 02:41:44,220
in at the end of the day and she would
go into check into the hotel and I would

3667
02:41:44,221 --> 02:41:48,540
take care of the bike and we pulled into
a days in and she got,

3668
02:41:48,750 --> 02:41:52,800
she hopped off the bike and I just never
took my feet off the pegs because I was

3669
02:41:52,801 --> 02:41:56,630
so tired and I just like benny hill just
slowly tipped over,

3670
02:41:57,300 --> 02:42:00,990
get her now the bar kind of caught it.

3671
02:42:01,190 --> 02:42:04,710
It just feels like a nub.
That's pretty good.

3672
02:42:05,010 --> 02:42:07,790
Yeah.
As far as like all the friends,

3673
02:42:07,960 --> 02:42:12,150
no.
I went with a couple of friends from

3674
02:42:12,151 --> 02:42:14,370
fear factor were all taken at the same
time.

3675
02:42:14,790 --> 02:42:16,860
Motorcycle safety course.
Oh yeah.

3676
02:42:16,920 --> 02:42:20,610
While I was doing it to people I know
got in car accidents on motorcycles.

3677
02:42:21,060 --> 02:42:21,840
Really?
Yeah.

3678
02:42:21,840 --> 02:42:25,350
And then one person I know saw a person
get hit,

3679
02:42:25,351 --> 02:42:29,730
saw someone stays out on their phone,
ran into some guy from behind,

3680
02:42:29,731 --> 02:42:32,740
so flying through the air just just hit
him.

3681
02:42:32,750 --> 02:42:34,830
He just bang.
It's terrible.

3682
02:42:34,890 --> 02:42:36,510
I know I,
I was lucky,

3683
02:42:36,511 --> 02:42:39,810
but once I came out here,
I had it in New York city for a long

3684
02:42:39,811 --> 02:42:41,520
time,
which was kind of manageable.

3685
02:42:41,521 --> 02:42:46,020
I would do like spots me and greg
giraldo would go between clubs and it

3686
02:42:46,021 --> 02:42:47,880
was night,
so it was kind of a little more mellow

3687
02:42:47,881 --> 02:42:49,590
and it was all right.
But once I came out here I was like,

3688
02:42:49,600 --> 02:42:53,250
there's no way I just had kids and my
career was starting to go.

3689
02:42:53,251 --> 02:42:54,120
Okay.
And I'm like,

3690
02:42:54,150 --> 02:42:55,680
there's too much to lose.
I mean,

3691
02:42:55,681 --> 02:42:58,590
and this place is nuts with driving as
it is.

3692
02:42:59,220 --> 02:43:01,320
And uh,
everybody drives out here too,

3693
02:43:01,530 --> 02:43:03,660
as opposed to in New York.
Those are professionals.

3694
02:43:03,720 --> 02:43:04,501
That's right.
Yeah,

3695
02:43:04,501 --> 02:43:05,580
you're right.
You're right.

3696
02:43:05,640 --> 02:43:08,310
It's not that they're better at it,
but you know,

3697
02:43:08,400 --> 02:43:11,860
amanda was in san francisco a couple of
weeks ago and I went into a ducati

3698
02:43:11,861 --> 02:43:12,370
triumph

3699
02:43:12,370 --> 02:43:15,280
shop.
Oh god.

3700
02:43:15,281 --> 02:43:17,650
It made me want to ship back on.
Oh,

3701
02:43:17,651 --> 02:43:20,470
they're so beautiful.
I've never written a ducati,

3702
02:43:20,471 --> 02:43:24,370
but I of them and these were like
touring ones.

3703
02:43:24,371 --> 02:43:26,560
Like I wasn't even interested in like
the real crotch rocket.

3704
02:43:26,561 --> 02:43:29,800
Like they've got these touring ones that
are so beautiful,

3705
02:43:29,980 --> 02:43:32,740
bad ass two copies of a cool sound to
them too.

3706
02:43:32,770 --> 02:43:34,780
They really do.
Very distinct.

3707
02:43:35,650 --> 02:43:36,461
Yeah.
I,

3708
02:43:36,461 --> 02:43:38,770
uh,
I do miss it for sure.

3709
02:43:38,860 --> 02:43:41,740
Who fucking things?
Yeah,

3710
02:43:41,770 --> 02:43:43,510
the new triumphs.
They're made to look like the old

3711
02:43:43,511 --> 02:43:45,760
triumph and those are great.
I know.

3712
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,400
It looks like so much fun.
So much fun.

3713
02:43:48,910 --> 02:43:51,250
Oh,
look at that fucking bike.

3714
02:43:51,360 --> 02:43:56,360
That's a double tailpipes oh my god.
How could you not want to just leave

3715
02:43:56,711 --> 02:43:59,790
everybody just go.
It's probably so fun now.

3716
02:43:59,830 --> 02:44:02,980
Apparently those things kind of have
like self balancing properties to them.

3717
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:04,930
Really.
Gyros will.

3718
02:44:04,930 --> 02:44:08,620
They have like a traction control.
Some of them do now.

3719
02:44:08,770 --> 02:44:12,280
And there was one that jamie showed that
some bike from the future that holds

3720
02:44:12,281 --> 02:44:14,550
itself up.
Who is that?

3721
02:44:14,560 --> 02:44:17,260
Who made it?
There's some new bmw bike that doesn't

3722
02:44:17,261 --> 02:44:18,790
really to any bike you've ever seen
before.

3723
02:44:18,791 --> 02:44:23,740
It looks like some total tron shit.
She some space age shit and this bike

3724
02:44:23,950 --> 02:44:25,030
is.
I think it's right.

3725
02:44:25,050 --> 02:44:26,790
It's a concept right now.
Go fullscreen.

3726
02:44:26,950 --> 02:44:29,500
So we could look at this shit.
You know what bmw is doing this,

3727
02:44:29,890 --> 02:44:34,360
but if this happens.
Jamie was saying they were saying you

3728
02:44:34,361 --> 02:44:37,730
don't need a helmet,
which is really.

3729
02:44:37,900 --> 02:44:42,010
I mean I'm just repeating what they say.
So look at these guys declared you don't

3730
02:44:42,011 --> 02:44:44,260
even need to wear clothes.
Looks at the goggles they have on.

3731
02:44:44,261 --> 02:44:46,690
She's got these goggles that are like
virtual reality headsets.

3732
02:44:46,691 --> 02:44:48,370
Go back.
So you could see those goggles before

3733
02:44:48,371 --> 02:44:49,204
she puts them on.

3734
02:44:49,750 --> 02:44:53,050
Like look at this.
Look at this fucking bike man.

3735
02:44:53,080 --> 02:44:55,320
Gordon.
This thing like tom cruise and the.

3736
02:44:55,390 --> 02:44:56,350
Yeah,
it looks so.

3737
02:44:56,351 --> 02:44:59,620
She can see like the speedometer and
everything comes through your vision.

3738
02:44:59,740 --> 02:45:01,450
Oh wow.
Look at that.

3739
02:45:01,480 --> 02:45:03,100
Look at that.
This is crazy.

3740
02:45:03,101 --> 02:45:07,150
It's got big fat batman tires.
That's going to look.

3741
02:45:07,151 --> 02:45:10,720
It's got the navigation system.
It's showing on the goggles.

3742
02:45:10,721 --> 02:45:14,290
She's running around like this is crazy.
That's amazing.

3743
02:45:14,291 --> 02:45:16,720
Is this coming soon?
I don't know if it's ever come and

3744
02:45:16,721 --> 02:45:18,520
really it might be bullshit.
No way.

3745
02:45:18,521 --> 02:45:20,370
All this stuff always comes out,
but watch.

3746
02:45:20,380 --> 02:45:23,310
She stands off of it and it stays up on
its own genres.

3747
02:45:23,340 --> 02:45:25,960
God,
of course it's coming,

3748
02:45:26,770 --> 02:45:28,220
but she doesn't.
She is.

3749
02:45:28,280 --> 02:45:30,810
She's so hot.
She'll totally would be with me.

3750
02:45:30,870 --> 02:45:32,120
Hotter,
hotter.

3751
02:45:32,140 --> 02:45:33,580
When you're on a bike like,
oh my god.

3752
02:45:33,581 --> 02:45:35,860
I find I follow on instagram.

3753
02:45:35,860 --> 02:45:40,240
It's look at that thing.
It's batman motor a list.

3754
02:45:40,840 --> 02:45:43,570
It's just fuck.
Just beautiful girls on these old

3755
02:45:43,571 --> 02:45:45,880
vintage bikes.
It's the sexiest thing I've ever seen.

3756
02:45:45,881 --> 02:45:47,500
Look at that.
Like she doesn't even have to balance

3757
02:45:47,501 --> 02:45:50,380
it.
It balances itself out because she's so

3758
02:45:50,381 --> 02:45:51,500
hot.
It's her pussy.

3759
02:45:52,800 --> 02:45:56,380
Pussy gyroscopes got such a
gravitational force at the whole thing.

3760
02:45:56,381 --> 02:45:58,630
I stay centered.
She's so.

3761
02:45:59,500 --> 02:46:00,970
You put a girl on a bike,
it's hot.

3762
02:46:02,530 --> 02:46:04,060
You know?
If you put a girl in a place where you

3763
02:46:04,061 --> 02:46:05,710
don't expect you,
could she?

3764
02:46:05,750 --> 02:46:10,220
She goes up and bright girl on a golf
course at a boxing gym with her hair

3765
02:46:10,221 --> 02:46:11,660
pulled back.
Oh my god.

3766
02:46:12,450 --> 02:46:15,950
A girl on a crew with just a tool belt.
Yeah,

3767
02:46:16,220 --> 02:46:17,360
girl.
On a golf course?

3768
02:46:17,600 --> 02:46:21,500
Yeah,
they go up because it's always fat guys.

3769
02:46:21,590 --> 02:46:23,510
Right.
Do you think a girl on a golf course,

3770
02:46:23,540 --> 02:46:26,470
just looking for deck,
how do you think they actually liked

3771
02:46:26,471 --> 02:46:28,530
golf?
Some completely

3772
02:46:28,620 --> 02:46:32,150
play.
Really entertaining.

3773
02:46:32,180 --> 02:46:36,410
What question?
It takes all types.

3774
02:46:36,740 --> 02:46:39,880
Real consideration.
probably all this looking for dick

3775
02:46:41,740 --> 02:46:44,640
possibly like it.
It's like guys playing with dolls.

3776
02:46:44,641 --> 02:46:47,450
Do you really like to play with dolls?
Yeah.

3777
02:46:48,150 --> 02:46:48,960
No,
I.

3778
02:46:48,960 --> 02:46:51,000
If you're out there on the links
playing,

3779
02:46:51,660 --> 02:46:54,240
she can play in some girls that couldn't

3780
02:46:54,270 --> 02:46:56,580
play it all.
We're just flirting with guys at the

3781
02:46:56,581 --> 02:46:58,260
driving range.
What are you showing me here?

3782
02:46:58,261 --> 02:46:59,910
Jamie?
Like the hottest.

3783
02:47:00,010 --> 02:47:03,120
Arguably female golfers.
Shag million followers on instagram

3784
02:47:03,130 --> 02:47:05,670
where she does female golfer and showing
her,

3785
02:47:05,671 --> 02:47:08,340
but imagine if that was a male golfer.
Standing like that.

3786
02:47:08,370 --> 02:47:10,200
Backup one.
Okay.

3787
02:47:10,260 --> 02:47:12,800
Male golfers standing like that show's
over.

3788
02:47:13,130 --> 02:47:14,850
Fell over.
Okay.

3789
02:47:18,030 --> 02:47:20,160
But she could do that.
You can stick her blood at you.

3790
02:47:20,370 --> 02:47:21,720
Yes.
Well he got to work.

3791
02:47:22,330 --> 02:47:24,270
Hey.
Well I'm sure she's got more than that.

3792
02:47:24,271 --> 02:47:26,340
You son of a bitch now.
She's talented.

3793
02:47:26,550 --> 02:47:29,760
Sexist.
I can't even believe my friend that's

3794
02:47:29,761 --> 02:47:32,370
going on here.
She's got tits hanging out and she's

3795
02:47:32,610 --> 02:47:36,120
wearing little tiny skirt.
You gotta work with what you got?

3796
02:47:36,360 --> 02:47:37,770
I'll come.
Dudes don't trust like that when they

3797
02:47:37,771 --> 02:47:40,390
hit balls.
Seems weird because we don't.

3798
02:47:40,710 --> 02:47:43,560
We don't have those bodies.
Our bodies are gross.

3799
02:47:45,290 --> 02:47:47,990
It looked like that.
If we were sleek and thin,

3800
02:47:48,610 --> 02:47:49,450
thin,
smooth,

3801
02:47:49,451 --> 02:47:51,820
hairless moves.
Not offensive.

3802
02:47:52,180 --> 02:47:54,120
No appendages dangling.
Yeah,

3803
02:47:54,130 --> 02:47:58,840
no disgusting and gross gross hairs
coming everywhere.

3804
02:47:58,900 --> 02:48:03,340
Everywhere I get harrison my ears.
Now I have to shave him some new thing

3805
02:48:03,550 --> 02:48:04,800
so I get older.
I get hairier.

3806
02:48:04,890 --> 02:48:07,000
Have neck hair now back in the neck.
Heron.

3807
02:48:07,330 --> 02:48:08,800
Yeah.
A beer here knows hair.

3808
02:48:08,890 --> 02:48:09,723
I'm covered.

3809
02:48:10,980 --> 02:48:13,970
I'm like a bear except where we want it.
Yeah,

3810
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:17,420
exactly.
I had a barbara and old italian barber

3811
02:48:17,480 --> 02:48:22,480
shave my ears when I was 15.
Just put like he took lotion shaving

3812
02:48:23,030 --> 02:48:25,300
stuff and put it on my ears and shave.
Great razor.

3813
02:48:25,450 --> 02:48:28,820
Yeah.
And ever since then just weeds growing

3814
02:48:28,821 --> 02:48:30,920
out of my ears.
Yeah.

3815
02:48:30,970 --> 02:48:34,280
I totally work that just grew that way.
Anyway.

3816
02:48:35,030 --> 02:48:37,820
That's why we shaving your ears at 15.
most kids don't have to get the fucking

3817
02:48:37,900 --> 02:48:41,210
marriage.
You're 15 your goddamn little wolf.

3818
02:48:41,211 --> 02:48:44,050
Boy,
like michael j.

3819
02:48:44,050 --> 02:48:44,883
Fox in that movie.
yeah,

3820
02:48:44,900 --> 02:48:47,990
but it was soft little fluffy hair.
Now it's like cactus

3821
02:48:48,280 --> 02:48:49,101
works that way.
Man.

3822
02:48:49,101 --> 02:48:51,740
I don't think like when you shave it,
it doesn't grow back thicker.

3823
02:48:51,741 --> 02:48:54,020
I think that's a myth.
I don't think that's true.

3824
02:48:54,021 --> 02:48:55,700
I think it definitely grows back
thicker.

3825
02:48:55,730 --> 02:48:56,660
Really?
Yeah.

3826
02:48:57,080 --> 02:48:59,490
I don't think it does matter.
I think this came up the other day I was

3827
02:48:59,540 --> 02:49:01,110
on here if I saw it,
but yeah,

3828
02:49:01,490 --> 02:49:03,470
definitely grows back then.
I'm pretty sure it's a myth.

3829
02:49:03,700 --> 02:49:06,640
My wife started shaving her mustache.
Now

3830
02:49:08,710 --> 02:49:11,370
john go,
but it's a war.

3831
02:49:11,371 --> 02:49:13,920
We will.
When we hack away,

3832
02:49:13,980 --> 02:49:16,770
I've got a.
I've got a trimmer that goes inside the

3833
02:49:16,771 --> 02:49:19,310
ear and the nose.
I got out at the nose.

3834
02:49:19,320 --> 02:49:21,480
One thing I shaved with my regular
razor.

3835
02:49:21,481 --> 02:49:24,210
As I'm shaving my face,
I shaved the back of my ears.

3836
02:49:24,670 --> 02:49:27,660
I am a hairy mess sometimes when I'm
driving in my car,

3837
02:49:27,780 --> 02:49:31,830
I'll grab a finger full of notes.
Terrace and all yank them out by the

3838
02:49:31,831 --> 02:49:33,930
roots feels good.
It's very satisfying.

3839
02:49:33,931 --> 02:49:37,290
When I look and I see a bunch of hairs
that are pulled out of my nose,

3840
02:49:37,320 --> 02:49:38,490
you got to get a trimmer.
Yeah,

3841
02:49:38,491 --> 02:49:41,180
I know I do,
but sometimes I can grab them and I'd

3842
02:49:41,181 --> 02:49:45,030
just like to grab my one.
My one part of my back is heavier than

3843
02:49:45,031 --> 02:49:45,930
the other side

3844
02:49:46,110 --> 02:49:48,600
fact or fiction.
If you shave or wax,

3845
02:49:48,601 --> 02:49:52,740
your hair will come back thicker and it
may look that way,

3846
02:49:52,770 --> 02:49:55,920
but it looks good.
I don't believe this science.

3847
02:49:55,980 --> 02:49:56,910
oh shit.
What the fuck.

3848
02:49:56,930 --> 02:50:00,840
In scientific America,
bunch of liberal nonsense that is simply

3849
02:50:00,841 --> 02:50:03,780
not so.
There are several reasons that the myth

3850
02:50:03,781 --> 02:50:07,170
continues to flourish.
One is the limitation of human

3851
02:50:07,171 --> 02:50:09,720
perception.
People are just not very good observers,

3852
02:50:09,721 --> 02:50:13,590
but there is no science.
Just no scIence behind hair growing back

3853
02:50:13,591 --> 02:50:15,260
thicker says amy,
me,

3854
02:50:15,310 --> 02:50:16,180
michael.
first of all,

3855
02:50:16,181 --> 02:50:20,070
it's a girl which she know,
chair of the department of dermatology

3856
02:50:20,071 --> 02:50:22,620
at wake forest baptist health.
We're just kidding.

3857
02:50:22,621 --> 02:50:24,120
Amy.
I'm sure you know a lot more than me.

3858
02:50:24,450 --> 02:50:27,060
There's also the power of coincidence.
Indeed.

3859
02:50:27,061 --> 02:50:29,880
Pervasive myths.
If a young boy shaves his mustache,

3860
02:50:29,890 --> 02:50:32,490
will grow back thicker,
are grounded in a kernel of truth,

3861
02:50:32,520 --> 02:50:34,920
it might,
but that's because the shaving may

3862
02:50:34,921 --> 02:50:39,690
overlap with the timing of natural
hormonal fluctuations in his body that

3863
02:50:39,691 --> 02:50:43,230
are developing his adult facial hair,
not because it was hair removal,

3864
02:50:43,830 --> 02:50:46,320
hair grows at different times and at
different rates.

3865
02:50:46,321 --> 02:50:48,990
For everybody.
Case closed and papa.

3866
02:50:49,470 --> 02:50:54,470
I had little fuzzies on my ears and now
I have cactus barbs that hurt my wife in

3867
02:50:56,371 --> 02:50:57,810
our sleep.
Whoa.

3868
02:50:58,110 --> 02:50:59,130
It's.
I'm a hairy mess.

3869
02:50:59,550 --> 02:51:04,550
I had a birthmark on my left side of my
back when I was young and it faded,

3870
02:51:05,040 --> 02:51:09,450
but what's remained his hair?
So my right side is not very.

3871
02:51:09,451 --> 02:51:12,030
Harry has some here,
but this side is just like a jungle.

3872
02:51:12,440 --> 02:51:13,550
A patch.
Well,

3873
02:51:13,770 --> 02:51:15,930
I used to have a song for it when I was
in high school.

3874
02:51:15,960 --> 02:51:17,790
What was it?
Sammy on my back.

3875
02:51:17,791 --> 02:51:18,660
Sammy.
I'm a back.

3876
02:51:18,661 --> 02:51:20,930
What you do in there with all that hair?
Sammy,

3877
02:51:21,380 --> 02:51:25,110
you got a million for it.
It was sammy my punch called sammy.

3878
02:51:25,140 --> 02:51:27,040
I'm one of my friends named it.
Wow.

3879
02:51:27,270 --> 02:51:32,270
That's some weird fucking jerk off.
To what you do in there with all that

3880
02:51:33,661 --> 02:51:35,310
hair.
Sammy.

3881
02:51:37,710 --> 02:51:40,050
And on that note,
ladies and gentlemen,

3882
02:51:40,200 --> 02:51:41,370
we just didn't know.
Three hours.

3883
02:51:41,400 --> 02:51:42,390
We did.
Yeah.

3884
02:51:42,830 --> 02:51:44,100
It's the best show ever.
Crazy.

3885
02:51:44,101 --> 02:51:45,750
How the fuck does that happen?
It's 4:30 already.

3886
02:51:45,810 --> 02:51:50,810
I'm dawn pop to you,
so when you're at home enjoying my bread

3887
02:51:51,751 --> 02:51:56,751
over memorial day weekend,
will I be enjoying any gift from milk

3888
02:51:57,841 --> 02:51:58,674
for you?
So yes.

3889
02:51:58,720 --> 02:52:00,870
Yes,
yes,

3890
02:52:01,540 --> 02:52:02,373
yes.

3891
02:52:03,220 --> 02:52:07,540
I have also,
I have purchased a new commercial sized

3892
02:52:07,541 --> 02:52:12,541
yoder pellet smoker and I will be
cooking from the new location.

3893
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:18,550
So next time we do a fight companion or
maybe next time you and I do a podcast,

3894
02:52:18,790 --> 02:52:22,600
we will sit down to a meal.
Really I will cook before you ever get

3895
02:52:22,601 --> 02:52:24,790
here.
So we'll have a meal and we'll put some

3896
02:52:24,791 --> 02:52:28,300
cameras on us and we'll talk some shit
while we're eating a nice delicious wild

3897
02:52:28,301 --> 02:52:31,000
game dinner.
I will bring the wine and the cigars.

3898
02:52:31,060 --> 02:52:35,620
Come on and dinner with gender,
with joe and tom dinner with dinner for

3899
02:52:35,621 --> 02:52:38,500
two and you bring bread and we'll have
some gentleman's butter.

3900
02:52:38,501 --> 02:52:40,600
What is it?
Gentleman's breakfast.

3901
02:52:40,810 --> 02:52:42,760
Three cigars?
Yes.

3902
02:52:42,820 --> 02:52:45,790
Bottle of wine that's done,
done and do that.

3903
02:52:45,791 --> 02:52:46,600
We're,
we're done.

3904
02:52:46,600 --> 02:52:48,250
It's a great idea.
So I have this,

3905
02:52:48,251 --> 02:52:49,840
uh,
it's a yoder.

3906
02:52:50,050 --> 02:52:50,740
Pull this up.

3907
02:52:50,740 --> 02:52:54,550
So yoder 1500.
I got one so I could cook for like six,

3908
02:52:54,590 --> 02:52:56,680
seven people at a time.
Perfect.

3909
02:52:56,681 --> 02:52:57,351
Yeah,
I got it.

3910
02:52:57,351 --> 02:52:58,720
IT's a big.
Ask her to this.

3911
02:52:58,810 --> 02:53:00,960
Well,
I'm a big fan of these pellet smokers.

3912
02:53:00,980 --> 02:53:03,970
What I like about these yoders is this
is by the way,

3913
02:53:04,840 --> 02:53:07,450
not an endorsement.
I paid full price for this thing.

3914
02:53:08,110 --> 02:53:09,790
Didn't ask for.
It.

3915
02:53:09,791 --> 02:53:11,680
Looks a little sponsorship.
It's big.

3916
02:53:11,710 --> 02:53:14,440
It's just a dope pellet smoker.
Holy cow.

3917
02:53:14,500 --> 02:53:15,790
It's made in America.
What do you keep?

3918
02:53:15,820 --> 02:53:17,170
What's pellets?
The pellet.

3919
02:53:17,560 --> 02:53:20,500
It works on pellets,
meaning hardwood pellets.

3920
02:53:20,590 --> 02:53:22,000
So what they do is they take,
you know,

3921
02:53:22,001 --> 02:53:25,870
when the lumberyard cuts up,
like maple or oak or some hardwood,

3922
02:53:26,110 --> 02:53:29,350
they take the pellets a,
they tape rather the saw dust and they

3923
02:53:29,351 --> 02:53:34,351
compress it and the natural sugars
compressed down into pellets.

3924
02:53:35,081 --> 02:53:39,220
And then pelvis hold together and they
pour these pellets in the hopper and the

3925
02:53:39,221 --> 02:53:44,170
hopper feeds into a worm drive that
feeds to a heating element.

3926
02:53:44,350 --> 02:53:47,170
So it's.
Keeps it at a very consistent

3927
02:53:47,171 --> 02:53:50,200
temperature heading.
Have you laid it well,

3928
02:53:50,201 --> 02:53:52,270
it lights itself just to.
Just to switch.

3929
02:53:52,271 --> 02:53:53,104
Yeah,
see it.

3930
02:53:53,180 --> 02:53:55,330
That's what it looks like.
And if you,

3931
02:53:55,370 --> 02:53:56,120
uh,
jamie,

3932
02:53:56,120 --> 02:53:59,110
see if he could find like it's dope.
I love these things.

3933
02:53:59,260 --> 02:54:03,460
And there's another company called
trager that just came out with a really

3934
02:54:03,461 --> 02:54:08,290
super high tech one that's thick and
insulated like a yeti cooler.

3935
02:54:08,620 --> 02:54:12,880
It's like they're the best model yet.
And you can control with an app and it

3936
02:54:12,881 --> 02:54:15,430
has digital thermometers that are built
into it.

3937
02:54:15,431 --> 02:54:17,170
So you can tell the temperature,
your food.

3938
02:54:17,171 --> 02:54:19,300
What's your,
what's your signature dish off of this

3939
02:54:19,301 --> 02:54:19,961
thing?
Well,

3940
02:54:19,961 --> 02:54:24,961
mostly I eat wild game because I shoot,
try to shoot an elk a year,

3941
02:54:25,361 --> 02:54:28,500
which is like 400 pounds of meat plus
god.

3942
02:54:28,570 --> 02:54:31,930
I give away a lot of aly for Japan,
but it's at 400 pounds of me.

3943
02:54:32,110 --> 02:54:34,000
But this year was a good year.
Yeah.

3944
02:54:34,030 --> 02:54:36,490
I shot two deer.
I shot a pig,

3945
02:54:36,610 --> 02:54:38,530
I shot an elk.
She's so,

3946
02:54:38,531 --> 02:54:41,770
I shot a lot of animals this year,
so I've got a lot of a big fridge at the

3947
02:54:41,771 --> 02:54:45,340
house to commercial freezers in the back
here and I have two more commercial

3948
02:54:45,341 --> 02:54:46,590
freezers at home.
Oh wow.

3949
02:54:47,920 --> 02:54:50,260
But I gave away a lot of food to my
friends.

3950
02:54:50,261 --> 02:54:52,840
Yeah.
I'm very proud of gave food to duncan

3951
02:54:52,841 --> 02:54:55,570
trussell.
I gave elk to Gary Clark jr.

3952
02:54:55,810 --> 02:54:57,580
Oh yeah.
One of the greatest guitarists of all

3953
02:54:57,581 --> 02:54:58,040
time.
Eight.

3954
02:54:58,040 --> 02:54:58,661
My.
Yeah,

3955
02:54:58,661 --> 02:55:02,230
that's great.
It sounds like a real group,

3956
02:55:02,231 --> 02:55:04,670
but yeah.
So triggered has this new one.

3957
02:55:04,900 --> 02:55:06,600
Um,
what did the timberline.

3958
02:55:06,650 --> 02:55:07,990
That's it.
That's a good number.

3959
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:13,000
Line is their new one and this new one
you could see like it has this crazy

3960
02:55:13,731 --> 02:55:18,731
convection oven cycling of the smoke and
the triggers got this really thick door.

3961
02:55:20,570 --> 02:55:25,570
My friend John Dudley has one of these.
I think there's some sort of a discount

3962
02:55:25,941 --> 02:55:28,070
that you can get.
I didn't want to buy one with his.

3963
02:55:28,370 --> 02:55:29,750
I don't know.
I uh,

3964
02:55:29,810 --> 02:55:33,140
I have a gas grill thing though.
And you just don't get that.

3965
02:55:33,200 --> 02:55:34,630
Not the same.
It's not the same.

3966
02:55:34,631 --> 02:55:35,464
Not the same.
This is,

3967
02:55:35,510 --> 02:55:36,920
this is.
No gas,

3968
02:55:36,921 --> 02:55:40,430
this is just would see the pellets.
There's no chemicals in it.

3969
02:55:40,460 --> 02:55:42,110
Oh,
so you just didn't know gas line or

3970
02:55:42,120 --> 02:55:42,601
anything?
No,

3971
02:55:42,601 --> 02:55:42,911
no,
no,

3972
02:55:42,911 --> 02:55:43,191
no,
no.

3973
02:55:43,191 --> 02:55:48,050
IT's just electricity heats up that
heating element and there's a fan that

3974
02:55:48,051 --> 02:55:50,510
blows air on the.
The,

3975
02:55:50,660 --> 02:55:54,620
the wood chips while they're getting
cooked and then it's just smoke smoke

3976
02:55:54,621 --> 02:55:56,750
and he cooks the food.
Dude I am.

3977
02:55:57,230 --> 02:55:59,000
I am sold.
There's another company,

3978
02:55:59,001 --> 02:56:01,190
a really good company called green
mountain grills.

3979
02:56:01,220 --> 02:56:02,990
They actually gave me a grIll back in
the day.

3980
02:56:02,990 --> 02:56:04,280
They were the first ones that ever
tried.

3981
02:56:04,580 --> 02:56:07,940
Those are excellent too,
and you can get a good one that's not.

3982
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,820
Not even too expensive.
Camp chef has another really nice one

3983
02:56:10,821 --> 02:56:11,630
too,
so I was not.

3984
02:56:11,630 --> 02:56:13,430
I'm not trying to tell anybody to buy
anything,

3985
02:56:13,610 --> 02:56:15,740
but I'm saying if you're thinking about
getting a grill,

3986
02:56:15,980 --> 02:56:17,660
I will look into one of these pellet
grill.

3987
02:56:17,661 --> 02:56:18,970
That's pretty bad ass.
Well,

3988
02:56:19,010 --> 02:56:22,820
it's super easy to use too.
You just pour the pellets into this

3989
02:56:22,821 --> 02:56:26,520
hopper and then you set the temperature.
How often you have to refresh the pellet

3990
02:56:26,580 --> 02:56:27,650
duty.
They're so.

3991
02:56:27,890 --> 02:56:31,820
They're so economical like it doesn't.
They don't last long because they keep

3992
02:56:31,821 --> 02:56:35,480
the exact right temperature or real
close to it within a few degrees up or

3993
02:56:35,481 --> 02:56:36,960
down.
You uh,

3994
02:56:37,010 --> 02:56:39,590
like the hopper.
I fill it up like every four or five

3995
02:56:39,591 --> 02:56:42,500
cooks.
And if that was like charcoal it would

3996
02:56:42,501 --> 02:56:43,334
last for one.

3997
02:56:43,990 --> 02:56:45,160
You know,
like you said that was,

3998
02:56:45,230 --> 02:56:46,640
that's what it looks like.
See those things.

3999
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,400
They look like some sort of a brand
cereal,

4000
02:56:49,430 --> 02:56:50,540
right?
Doesn't it like one of those?

4001
02:56:50,541 --> 02:56:51,920
Yeah,
that like terrible food.

4002
02:56:52,070 --> 02:56:56,030
Yeah.
So what it is is just hardwood sawdust

4003
02:56:56,180 --> 02:56:59,770
and they just smush it and the naturaL
sugar is make it stick together because

4004
02:56:59,780 --> 02:57:02,870
you could break it up with your fingers,
like you break it up easy.

4005
02:57:03,320 --> 02:57:05,930
So you pour it into the hopper,
it grinds down,

4006
02:57:05,931 --> 02:57:09,020
see that worm drive below.
It feeds down to that thing on the

4007
02:57:09,021 --> 02:57:10,790
right,
which is like where the heating element

4008
02:57:10,791 --> 02:57:15,791
is and so it just catches fire and then
the flames make smoke and then it fills

4009
02:57:16,311 --> 02:57:18,500
up that chamber and the heat comes from
the smoke.

4010
02:57:18,590 --> 02:57:22,250
So when You put a an elk steak or
something on there,

4011
02:57:22,670 --> 02:57:25,540
can you cook it like in just a couple
minutes or is everything just smoke

4012
02:57:25,590 --> 02:57:25,960
slow?

4013
02:57:25,960 --> 02:57:28,070
It takes a long time.
So like the way I do it now,

4014
02:57:28,130 --> 02:57:30,440
I've done it a bunch of different ways
and all of them are delicious.

4015
02:57:30,441 --> 02:57:33,530
Like elk is my favorite meat.
It's delicious healthy meat.

4016
02:57:33,590 --> 02:57:38,590
But my favorite way to do it now because
of this guy Chad whiskey bent barbecue

4017
02:57:40,641 --> 02:57:44,480
on instagram was my friend john dudley's
buddy who's a world champion.

4018
02:57:44,481 --> 02:57:46,310
pitmaster like one of those.
Oh yeah,

4019
02:57:46,340 --> 02:57:50,660
bad motherfucker grill guys.
James says don't ever cook meat above

4020
02:57:50,661 --> 02:57:53,420
275 degrees.
He says when you're cooking you should

4021
02:57:53,421 --> 02:57:57,020
cook it slowly and don't allow the meat
to dry out and use a meat thermometer.

4022
02:57:57,021 --> 02:58:00,200
So since I started doing that,
I've been very happy with the results

4023
02:58:00,470 --> 02:58:04,980
because I get it hundred and 30,
135 degrees somewhere around there.

4024
02:58:05,220 --> 02:58:07,620
Then I pull it and then I reverse sear
it.

4025
02:58:07,950 --> 02:58:09,660
The way I do it is on a frying pan.

4026
02:58:09,660 --> 02:58:12,120
I use butter in the frying pan with
garlic and I see her,

4027
02:58:12,121 --> 02:58:14,520
that shit out of it on each side real
quick.

4028
02:58:14,521 --> 02:58:16,470
Like 30 seconds.
Like you're walking into the house.

4029
02:58:16,620 --> 02:58:17,760
Yeah,
breaking into the house.

4030
02:58:17,790 --> 02:58:22,380
Then I get even crazier and I wrap it up
with aluminum foil and I put it in a

4031
02:58:22,381 --> 02:58:25,410
yeti cooler and I seal it up for 15
minutes.

4032
02:58:26,220 --> 02:58:29,730
Let it slowly keep cooking,
cause real slow cooled down.

4033
02:58:29,940 --> 02:58:34,620
And then I opened it up and I let it sit
for another 10 minutes and then I slice

4034
02:58:34,621 --> 02:58:37,470
into that.
So what should I do with the gas grill?

4035
02:58:38,550 --> 02:58:40,230
We'll talk,
we'll talk.

4036
02:58:40,290 --> 02:58:42,480
Throw that thing in the fucking.
Give it to homeless people,

4037
02:58:43,600 --> 02:58:46,740
throw it in the la river.
Say this is when you can do something

4038
02:58:46,741 --> 02:58:48,510
like that and you get good at it,
right?

4039
02:58:48,511 --> 02:58:49,680
This is the bread thing.
It's like,

4040
02:58:49,681 --> 02:58:50,514
yes,
you're in.

4041
02:58:50,730 --> 02:58:52,200
Yes.
Well for me it's a.

4042
02:58:52,380 --> 02:58:53,490
It's.
I love cooking.

4043
02:58:53,760 --> 02:58:57,630
I've always loved cooking and it's not.
There's a little bit of a manly thing

4044
02:58:57,631 --> 02:59:01,830
that I like more with cooking,
with lump charcoal over a charcoal grill

4045
02:59:01,880 --> 02:59:05,680
smell and something very manly about the
real fire chemo,

4046
02:59:06,030 --> 02:59:11,030
but honestly as far as taste and as far
as ease of use and repeatability,

4047
02:59:13,170 --> 02:59:16,830
it's hard to fuck with these pellet
grills because you're cooking with real

4048
02:59:16,831 --> 02:59:17,940
wood fire.
Yeah,

4049
02:59:17,941 --> 02:59:19,740
it smells great.
it tastes great.

4050
02:59:19,741 --> 02:59:24,180
Like when you open the lid up,
the smell of like maple and see the

4051
02:59:24,181 --> 02:59:24,881
different,
you know,

4052
02:59:24,881 --> 02:59:26,760
you can buy a bunch of differently.
Applewood,

4053
02:59:26,790 --> 02:59:29,850
all kinds of different cherry by all
kinds of different pellets.

4054
02:59:30,630 --> 02:59:33,210
I need a bigger yard.
Isn't even that big man?

4055
02:59:33,211 --> 02:59:33,930
No.
No.

4056
02:59:33,930 --> 02:59:36,930
And again,
it economical like I know green mountain

4057
02:59:36,931 --> 02:59:40,470
grill go to green mountain grill.
They have a pretty small one that is

4058
02:59:40,471 --> 02:59:41,760
only like a few hundred bucks.

4059
02:59:42,120 --> 02:59:45,090
And um,
my mother in law has my old one.

4060
02:59:45,091 --> 02:59:46,130
It's great.
Yeah,

4061
02:59:46,200 --> 02:59:47,940
they're fucking great man.
It still works.

4062
02:59:47,941 --> 02:59:49,580
I've had it for years.
Really?

4063
02:59:49,680 --> 02:59:52,440
Yeah.
And that one has a built in thing.

4064
02:59:52,441 --> 02:59:54,630
It's called the Daniel Boone.
You know,

4065
02:59:54,631 --> 02:59:57,720
one thing I took off of your instagram
was the,

4066
02:59:57,721 --> 03:00:00,060
uh,
the eggs and just throwing the kale on

4067
03:00:00,061 --> 03:00:02,310
top of it.
Oh yeah.

4068
03:00:02,640 --> 03:00:03,900
It's a lifesaver.
I mean,

4069
03:00:03,901 --> 03:00:06,840
that's such a simple morning.
Oh,

4070
03:00:06,841 --> 03:00:07,810
it's the best.
So he's,

4071
03:00:07,860 --> 03:00:12,510
what I do is I take some kale,
I chop it up and then I chop up some

4072
03:00:12,511 --> 03:00:17,511
garlic and usually I do jalapenos too.
Then I get some butter cooking.

4073
03:00:17,790 --> 03:00:21,030
I put the kale in the butter,
I saw to it and once it really starts

4074
03:00:21,031 --> 03:00:22,500
getting darker,
it's ready to rock.

4075
03:00:22,650 --> 03:00:25,410
I just crack a few eggs and right on top
of it and mix it all up,

4076
03:00:25,710 --> 03:00:27,900
put it on a plate and it's fantastic.

4077
03:00:27,930 --> 03:00:29,940
You mix it up.
They look like they were sunny side up.

4078
03:00:30,110 --> 03:00:33,450
Sometimes I do that too.
Sometimes I just put the kale right next

4079
03:00:33,451 --> 03:00:34,260
to the eggs.
Right.

4080
03:00:34,260 --> 03:00:36,690
Sometimes I cook the eggs in the kale.
yeah.

4081
03:00:36,691 --> 03:00:39,060
I've just been throwing the kale on top
of the eggs.

4082
03:00:39,070 --> 03:00:39,900
Great.
Two.

4083
03:00:39,900 --> 03:00:40,740
Great.
Yeah.

4084
03:00:40,950 --> 03:00:42,000
Great.
So fast.

4085
03:00:42,001 --> 03:00:43,110
Yeah.
Super easy.

4086
03:00:43,140 --> 03:00:44,340
The best.
What's this one?

4087
03:00:44,370 --> 03:00:46,350
Have you tried one of these?
I have pretty,

4088
03:00:46,410 --> 03:00:48,060
yeah,
those are great shoes.

4089
03:00:48,970 --> 03:00:51,300
I have a,
I don't think I have that one.

4090
03:00:51,301 --> 03:00:52,830
I have another one like it.
What is the.

4091
03:00:52,831 --> 03:00:56,100
Yeah,
what you do is you vacuum seal your food

4092
03:00:56,101 --> 03:01:00,220
in a plastic bag and then you put it in
a pot with water and then

4093
03:01:00,220 --> 03:01:02,920
the hot water,
the thing will heat up to temperature of

4094
03:01:02,921 --> 03:01:04,860
the water,
like 125 degrees.

4095
03:01:05,350 --> 03:01:10,350
MY question would be like,
is the plastic leaching into your food?

4096
03:01:10,960 --> 03:01:13,210
They say it doesn't and it's a good
question though,

4097
03:01:13,720 --> 03:01:16,900
but how do we.
I mean you can't microwave plastic if

4098
03:01:16,901 --> 03:01:19,510
it's a certain temperature.
Maybe the plastic needs to hit a certain

4099
03:01:20,140 --> 03:01:22,510
temperature to melt.
well they say you should never drink

4100
03:01:22,900 --> 03:01:25,290
bottles that have been in your car in a
hot day in la.

4101
03:01:25,370 --> 03:01:27,090
I was wondering about that reCent.
I was just like,

4102
03:01:27,100 --> 03:01:28,210
hi.
And thinking about that.

4103
03:01:28,660 --> 03:01:31,870
Where did that story like maybe come
from maybe the glass bottled water

4104
03:01:31,871 --> 03:01:33,780
people are putting out false.
Who's good?

4105
03:01:33,790 --> 03:01:35,440
Is there a glass bottle?
Water business,

4106
03:01:35,470 --> 03:01:37,300
yay.
And all those are all glass bottles.

4107
03:01:37,301 --> 03:01:40,480
They started off.
What's the trend on it?

4108
03:01:40,540 --> 03:01:43,280
I think there's actual science behind it
that I was just wondering was all

4109
03:01:43,970 --> 03:01:44,710
conspiracy.

4110
03:01:44,710 --> 03:01:45,880
You were high.
That's what you're saying.

4111
03:01:47,720 --> 03:01:51,370
The sous vide is good.
I have actually a blow torch that I do

4112
03:01:51,371 --> 03:01:52,870
with zeus feed.
Oh yeah.

4113
03:01:52,871 --> 03:01:55,840
So I do sous vide and then I cook the
outside of it with a torch.

4114
03:01:56,680 --> 03:01:59,650
Yeah,
get that brown on the outside.

4115
03:01:59,920 --> 03:02:01,810
I've done that,
but I don't prefer it.

4116
03:02:02,470 --> 03:02:05,860
I prefer the trigger style mountain
grill.

4117
03:02:05,861 --> 03:02:08,470
Yoda grill was pellet grills.
Again,

4118
03:02:08,471 --> 03:02:10,930
there's a bunch of different companies.
I'm not trying to endorse one.

4119
03:02:11,200 --> 03:02:14,410
I like green mountain grill.
My friend John Dudley loves those

4120
03:02:14,411 --> 03:02:17,350
triggers and then.
But that new trigger timberline's pretty

4121
03:02:17,351 --> 03:02:22,351
revolutionary and it's supposed to be
amazing in its ability to insulate.

4122
03:02:22,810 --> 03:02:26,020
Think actually the best one to.
There's another one called the memphis

4123
03:02:26,050 --> 03:02:27,710
memphis grills.
Supposed to be really good at that.

4124
03:02:27,770 --> 03:02:32,770
Someone told me if you have a glass,
a gas grill to put a cast iron pan on it

4125
03:02:34,270 --> 03:02:35,770
and you do your steak that Way.

4126
03:02:35,860 --> 03:02:36,700
Yeah,
that's a good move.

4127
03:02:36,820 --> 03:02:38,140
Yeah.
To get that,

4128
03:02:38,200 --> 03:02:41,500
that seared flavor from a cast and it's
more even.

4129
03:02:41,501 --> 03:02:44,530
It's gets a little more,
a lot of big times.

4130
03:02:44,531 --> 03:02:46,570
Take restaurants,
still use cast iron pans,

4131
03:02:46,760 --> 03:02:49,060
cast irons.
Pretty bad ass.

4132
03:02:49,090 --> 03:02:50,300
You know,
you get iron from it too.

4133
03:02:50,480 --> 03:02:52,580
You to dietary iron.
Yeah.

4134
03:02:52,780 --> 03:02:54,100
Yeah.
It was just crazy.

4135
03:02:54,460 --> 03:02:56,130
You don't really explain him.
Good for you.

4136
03:02:56,920 --> 03:02:58,450
You get like,
it's good to cook.

4137
03:02:58,451 --> 03:03:01,090
Even vegetables like cooking vegetables
in,

4138
03:03:01,250 --> 03:03:03,250
in an iron pan.
You get a little bit of iron.

4139
03:03:03,280 --> 03:03:04,270
Oh really?
Yeah.

4140
03:03:04,510 --> 03:03:06,130
that's good for my wife.
So true.

4141
03:03:06,350 --> 03:03:07,900
Make sure that's true.
Was a little low iron.

4142
03:03:08,350 --> 03:03:09,550
I feel like I might be lying.
No,

4143
03:03:09,551 --> 03:03:10,600
I think you're right.
I've heard that

4144
03:03:12,230 --> 03:03:14,650
cares.
I do so many podcasts.

4145
03:03:14,840 --> 03:03:16,690
There's so many things that I've said
that are not true.

4146
03:03:16,950 --> 03:03:19,300
And then I try to deceive you folks.

4147
03:03:20,670 --> 03:03:22,450
We're doing our best.
I'll do my best.

4148
03:03:22,530 --> 03:03:24,550
I am doing my best.
Tom papa,

4149
03:03:24,551 --> 03:03:26,290
working these fine people.
See you perform.

4150
03:03:26,300 --> 03:03:28,300
You're wonderful and magical.
Standup comedy.

4151
03:03:28,450 --> 03:03:32,110
I'm going to uh,
do some shows in oakmont,

4152
03:03:32,140 --> 03:03:35,890
Pennsylvania and a theater in richfield,
Connecticut.

4153
03:03:35,891 --> 03:03:38,620
And old saybrook go to tom.
Papa.com.

4154
03:03:39,070 --> 03:03:43,180
I've got a bunch of stuff in june and
then starting up again in the fall and

4155
03:03:43,260 --> 03:03:47,890
my specialist,
a streaming on hulu and amazon and I'm

4156
03:03:47,980 --> 03:03:50,140
following my instagram.
If you want bread tips,

4157
03:03:50,350 --> 03:03:53,960
how old is your special now?
It was about six months ago.

4158
03:03:54,020 --> 03:03:55,660
Five months ago.
Six months ago?

4159
03:03:56,100 --> 03:03:58,640
Yeah.
And when do you think you'll think about

4160
03:03:58,641 --> 03:04:00,500
doing another one?
What kind of schedule you on?

4161
03:04:00,530 --> 03:04:04,060
I feel like I could start lining it up
because I've got about a.

4162
03:04:04,230 --> 03:04:06,360
I've got about 35,
40.

4163
03:04:06,361 --> 03:04:10,830
That's really solid
fillable stuff.

4164
03:04:10,890 --> 03:04:12,570
Right.
And um,

4165
03:04:12,600 --> 03:04:14,280
you know,
keep working at that pace by the time I

4166
03:04:14,281 --> 03:04:17,850
set it up and go do it.
It'll be probably I did it last july is

4167
03:04:17,851 --> 03:04:21,900
when I filmed it.
So we're coming up on a year and if I

4168
03:04:21,901 --> 03:04:25,680
did it probably like a year and a half
to two years,

4169
03:04:25,681 --> 03:04:28,080
it feels like two years might be a
little long,

4170
03:04:28,081 --> 03:04:29,790
but it feels like a year and a half will
be.

4171
03:04:30,330 --> 03:04:32,790
It will be ready and I know it was a
clock on it.

4172
03:04:32,791 --> 03:04:36,690
It's really like when is it ready?
But if I'm already at that point,

4173
03:04:36,840 --> 03:04:38,730
I feel like I should crank it out.

4174
03:04:38,940 --> 03:04:40,920
Yeah.
I'm on the exact same schedule.

4175
03:04:40,980 --> 03:04:41,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

4176
03:04:42,240 --> 03:04:44,640
A lot of people I've talked to have that
Same opinion.

4177
03:04:44,920 --> 03:04:46,560
That seems to be like that.
Like a year out,

4178
03:04:46,561 --> 03:04:48,570
a year and a half,
and you start feeling this is real.

4179
03:04:48,610 --> 03:04:49,770
It's ready to go.
Yeah.

4180
03:04:49,771 --> 03:04:50,710
It takes time.
Yeah.

4181
03:04:50,860 --> 03:04:53,890
You know when you want it to be.
I don't want to just eat.

4182
03:04:54,580 --> 03:04:56,290
You cross the finish line.
I want to,

4183
03:04:56,291 --> 03:04:58,000
you know,
you want it to be better than the last

4184
03:04:58,001 --> 03:04:58,270
one.

4185
03:04:58,270 --> 03:04:59,710
Yeah.
You want it to be representative of

4186
03:04:59,711 --> 03:05:02,950
where you are.
You feel your standup is right now.

4187
03:05:02,980 --> 03:05:05,790
You know exactly what a great nights and
you have.

4188
03:05:05,870 --> 03:05:07,600
You're not like,
it's a matter of being,

4189
03:05:07,840 --> 03:05:11,050
getting it so consistent that you get to
the ball like this motherfucker's ready.

4190
03:05:11,080 --> 03:05:11,980
Right,
exactlY.

4191
03:05:12,070 --> 03:05:13,510
It's,
you pulled the bread out of the oven.

4192
03:05:13,630 --> 03:05:14,470
Right?
Exactly.

4193
03:05:15,470 --> 03:05:17,890
Some pellets.
And on that note,

4194
03:05:17,891 --> 03:05:20,120
ladies and gentlemen,
oh,

4195
03:05:21,220 --> 03:05:22,910
that's the end of this podcast.
Wait,

4196
03:05:22,920 --> 03:05:27,130
I mentioned that papa podcasts.
I always forget to turn people on to

4197
03:05:27,131 --> 03:05:28,240
that,
but that's the best.

4198
03:05:28,241 --> 03:05:31,180
Comics are the worst at self promotion.
I know.

4199
03:05:31,181 --> 03:05:32,620
That's a good thing my friend.
Thank you.

4200
03:05:32,710 --> 03:05:34,780
So I'm getting.

4201
03:05:35,140 --> 03:05:36,850
Not this weekend.
I'll be there next week though.

4202
03:05:36,910 --> 03:05:37,660
Okay.
Yeah,

4203
03:05:37,660 --> 03:05:39,050
I'll see you there next week.
Sounds good.

4204
03:05:39,790 --> 03:05:42,190
