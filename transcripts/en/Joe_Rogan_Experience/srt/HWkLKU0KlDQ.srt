1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,320
Yeah,
it is right.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:06,590
It's delicious.
Wow.

3
00:00:08,021 --> 00:00:13,021
You recorded one.
Beautiful Jamie and my fucking laptop is

4
00:00:13,511 --> 00:00:15,400
on.
This is my real laptop folks.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,040
You know,
it's not like we have a dedicated laptop

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,340
in the studio.
Actually use this laptop on the road.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,310
It's not just here.
Laptop is mine.

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,510
It's very important to me.
Tamara,

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,630
thanks for warning me about the Werewolf
and they in the lobby.

10
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,640
That's good.
Shit.

11
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,680
Good Shit.
Your pants was eyeballing me speaking to

12
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:37,990
shit your pants.
I didn't tell you that it was there.

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,240
No.
Jamie,

14
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,500
tell us about the law.
The law is shitting your pants.

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,720
Uh,
there's a headline here that says,

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,650
um,
let me see.

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,980
San Francisco,
just San Francisco finally able to ban 

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:52,490
people who shit

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,850
on the people considered.
Okay.

20
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,230
San Francisco is a beautiful place.
It's a very unusual school.

21
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,240
Ended that corner.
So it's important for a place like San 

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,890
Francisco to exist to be that far off 
the left wing trail.

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,320
What's interesting about,
they're really conservative up there 

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,940
that just conservative liberals.
That's very well put there.

25
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:19,941
Unbending,
you know exactly what they think on 

26
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:22,401
every issue.
There's this episode of the Joe Rogan 

27
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:24,330
experience podcast is brought to you by 
squarespace.com.

28
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:29,730
Uh,
I don't know if squarespace's in San 

29
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,820
Francisco,
but a lot of smart motherfuckers are a 

30
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:31,820
lot of smart dudes up.
Oh yeah.

31
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,200
My rarer brilliant.
Well they got sunnyvale right near there

32
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:39,201
with all the technical people.
Atherton and I'll let a squarespace is a

33
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:44,931
website building website.
If you've ever thought about starting 

34
00:01:44,931 --> 00:01:47,970
your own website,
just just to fucking write shit down,

35
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:50,070
just to create a blog just for fun,
just to,

36
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,050
you know,
whenever you know,

37
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,270
make a website with pictures of you and 
your friends.

38
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,270
Start a business if you wanted to do 
that squarespace's like one of the 

39
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,140
easiest ways to do it.
Unlike in the past we had to like get to

40
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:06,141
know a program and like learn 
dreamweaver or actually try to code it 

41
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:09,750
yourself with html,
which is so beyond my grasp.

42
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,990
I don't even,
I wouldn't even think about attempting 

43
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:14,990
to do that.
I know how stupid I am.

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,300
But with squarespace you can do it and 
it's pretty easy and there's a bunch of 

45
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,220
different cool designs and you don't 
have to even pay to try it out.

46
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:26,640
If you go to squarespace.com
forward slash Joe,

47
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,950
you don't need to give them any credit 
card.

48
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,980
Just go and check it out.
And if you want to use it,

49
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,240
then use the code named Joe.
And what does it now it's five.

50
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,700
It's fucking May.
May Joe Five.

51
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,440
So that's one word.

52
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,240
It's Joe and the number five together.
So squarespace.com

53
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:51,930
forward slash Joe.
And the overcoat is Joe Five.

54
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,980
It's a really cool website building 
machine.

55
00:02:55,981 --> 00:03:00,981
Really it's,
it makes it so much easier than back in 

56
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:04,111
the design and you can make like a 
really competent site and you could 

57
00:03:04,111 --> 00:03:05,680
build an online store like super easy to
do.

58
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,490
So go check it out.
You fucks got through it.

59
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,830
That was good.
Do you like that?

60
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:16,831
I throw that angry part at the end.
It made me legitimate even though I'm 

61
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:19,810
selling them something that ghetto and I
gotta get my street cred back.

62
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,640
That's what it is.
Yeah.

63
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:22,650
You know,
folks,

64
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,410
there's a certain amount of gross snus 
and selling anything and I'll absolutely

65
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:31,411
admit that there's a certain amount of 
gross snus and saying the same thing 

66
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,310
over and over again.
Go to ting and tings,

67
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,310
a cool company and sell shit you don't 
believe in.

68
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,950
That is true and if I'm wrong about any 
of this stuff,

69
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:43,090
I'll let you know as well.
Like what if team turned out to be evil?

70
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,220
You know,
tim was a secret branch of the 

71
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,930
government,
designed to get you more happy with your

72
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:51,550
phone.
People are getting discontents.

73
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,040
10 came along with a better deal.
Calm everybody down.

74
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,070
Another conspiracy.
People on the phone.

75
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,830
We need him on the phone all the time.
Let's make it cheaper.

76
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,980
Cheaper.
Have you ever met anybody through a way?

77
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:05,470
You wouldn't have to even it with 
somebody,

78
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:10,471
but the idea like because I suffered 
from online people meet black people 

79
00:04:10,471 --> 00:04:11,170
have one commercial that you see that 
no.

80
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:14,560
What is this place for black people to 
meet black like a website.

81
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:19,561
They're so hard.
Why don't you just go to a black 

82
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:19,561
neighborhood,
go to a bar.

83
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,250
They have a website.
Well,

84
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,060
if it's,
you know,

85
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,230
nothing wrong with being specific,
you know,

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,960
I mean,
if can't imagine,

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Italians don't think so.
There's got to be an Italian is looking 

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,530
for Italians website.
This guy.

89
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,460
Yeah,
because Italians love other Italians are

90
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,530
an Italian girl.
Oh,

91
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:40,630
they're the worst to the best of the 
worst.

92
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,230
Be related to the savages sexually.
They're fucking animals.

93
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,570
Oh my goodness.
They're fucking beasts.

94
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,770
They're,
they're like,

95
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,190
they're.
Yeah.

96
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:49,900
The savages.
They are savages.

97
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,090
I liked the,
I like a girl who's not like me.

98
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,430
The liquid.
We used to say she's a good kid.

99
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,940
She's a good kid.
But the last,

100
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,890
the tiny girlfriend I had,
she's like,

101
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,210
she's likely to swing at me.
No.

102
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,650
Should we get crazy?
Yeah.

103
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,890
Yeah,
that's what my friend said to me about 

104
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:15,890
it.
He said,

105
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:15,890
I've never cheated on my wife.
I'd be afraid to stab me in the neck.

106
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,130
I was asleep.
You know,

107
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:22,131
this is a girl like del girlfriend the 
last.

108
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,690
That was the last one.
I was like,

109
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,090
you though.
Yeah.

110
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,890
I was like,
I think I was 21.

111
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,560
She was great kid.
Beautiful person,

112
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:31,360
but they're just,
wow.

113
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,890
I keep in touch with her.
No,

114
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:36,230
I do not know.
I do just testing you.

115
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,830
A Tang is the other podcast.
Sponsor Tang is a cell phone company 

116
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,480
that uses sprint backbone and what it 
does is they.

117
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,830
They have it set up so there's no 
contract,

118
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:50,950
so you can quit anytime you want.
You buy the phones.

119
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,520
The phones that they sell are the best 
android phones available.

120
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,820
They have all the high end android 
devices including the Samsung Galaxy 

121
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:03,050
note to which is this crazy fucking 
phone.

122
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:04,520
I've never seen this thing before.
It's.

123
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,900
It is preposterous.
It's gigantic preposterous phone.

124
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:13,901
It's the one that starts your car and 
all that does is sets the climate and 

125
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:16,670
the car,
like if it's cold,

126
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,510
so ridiculous.
It starts your car.

127
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,220
How is that possible?
Is that really possible?

128
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,020
And App it starts your car.
Oh yeah,

129
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:27,630
because there's remotes for awhile 
because they.

130
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,290
They would do it like in like in 
Montreal called places Tom Around.

131
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,370
I'm not ready for this yet.
I'm not ready for apps to start your 

132
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:36,370
fucking car.
I'm not ready for that.

133
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,700
That's too much.
Car pulls up.

134
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,470
Get in Joe.

135
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,870
Google cars,
they're doing that already dumb.

136
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,920
They already have these remote control 
cars and they drive around the city and 

137
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,740
they drive themselves.
They react to cars coming at them.

138
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,400
They haven't even been getting in 
accidents.

139
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:55,450
It's nuts.
It's fucking nuts and I still wouldn't 

140
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:55,450
trust it.
Well,

141
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:55,820
I can't imagine sitting in the back 
seat,

142
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,850
but my car driving itself,
there are a lot of fucking assholes out 

143
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:00,850
there,
Tom that drive cars.

144
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,771
There's a lot of fucking assholes.
I saw some kid the other day just 

145
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:07,280
weaving in and out of traffic.
Speeding.

146
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:11,150
He was flying past people in like a 
real,

147
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:16,010
like arrested while he was in the wrong 
place at the right time,

148
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,550
you know,
he was doing the wrong thing at the 

149
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:21,550
right time.
There's no cops anywhere by him,

150
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,120
but with the way he was driving was like
really crazy aggressive,

151
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:25,520
like cutting people off and racing in 
front of him.

152
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,380
It was dangerous.
Like he was like,

153
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,740
he was cutting like random strangers,
like off,

154
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:35,741
like barely missing their car.
It was kind of maniacal to walk like 

155
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:36,980
every now and then you just get a person
like that.

156
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:41,981
It's just really crazy article about 
teenagers that their brains aren't fully

157
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:47,651
developed and there's a reason to get in
so many accidents because their 

158
00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:49,100
perception,
the reactions are good physically,

159
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,130
but they make wrong choices.
Terrible choices.

160
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,100
I was a terrible driver when I was a 
terrible,

161
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,670
terrible driver.
Now see me drive.

162
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,790
Don't even watch.
Could pull it off.

163
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,620
Would you be happy if Google came along 
with something that you can say,

164
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:05,621
take me home and the fucking robot call.
That's common mind mind.

165
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,670
If I open up a six pack,
I would definitely.

166
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,890
If you're drinking and driving and your 
car,

167
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,140
your car is driving itself.
Can you still get arrested?

168
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,840
If it's a very good question because you
would have to.

169
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,510
It would have to know for sure.
You know where you're going,

170
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,970
right?
No,

171
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,990
you wouldn't.
You couldn't tell it to,

172
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,991
hey,
go fucking driving the wrong lane of 

173
00:08:25,991 --> 00:08:25,991
this street.
I mean,

174
00:08:25,991 --> 00:08:27,140
we would have to be some sort of.
It would have to have a.

175
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:31,130
A thing that said it couldn't do it,
so there wouldn't to be.

176
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,890
How does it know when there's a light to
turn green?

177
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:34,550
Has It?
No one,

178
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:39,551
there's a light turns red and it's going
to have to be plugged into the whole 

179
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:40,700
system.
Now there's going to be have to be,

180
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,620
you know,
if you really think about it,

181
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:47,621
it's going to have to be like a wifi 
network or something everywhere that 

182
00:08:47,621 --> 00:08:50,651
controls these cars.
I mean they would have to have real 

183
00:08:50,651 --> 00:08:53,381
control to to let a car go and just 
drive around with no person touching the

184
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,480
and make sure that it stays on path.

185
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,050
Wow.
I would think that would be really hard 

186
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,050
to trust.
I mean,

187
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,750
I don't know how you controlling it.
I don't understand what's.

188
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,780
How's it getting to it?
It's got to get there from the cell 

189
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,210
phone has got to be some sort of a 
signal that's reaching the car.

190
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,500
Unless the car is just a robot,
a self sufficient robot,

191
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:16,320
which is even crazier.
That means no one is controlling it.

192
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,740
That means it just goes on what it knows
about what's in front of it with radar 

193
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,530
or whatever.
It's using sonar.

194
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:24,810
I don't know when it's using who.
That's crazy.

195
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,950
That's kind of nuts at the end.
If that happens,

196
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:33,951
that's an APP that you get the fucking 
take download Merera home app and you 

197
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:37,350
press that or your phone and your 
fucking car just drives you home.

198
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,870
Why is that so weird to me?
Of course that's coming,

199
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:40,200
right?

200
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,630
Take me home while you hungry.
That's all,

201
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,980
isn't it?
It's coming.

202
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,470
It's coming.
It's amazing how technology has advanced

203
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:51,471
so much in the last five years we had 
panic attacks.

204
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:54,720
If we forget our cell phone now I have a
panic attack.

205
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:56,820
If I forgot my cell phone.
Yeah,

206
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,050
and you know it's.
It's so valuable for finding shit out.

207
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,410
It's so valuable for like going on 
websites to read anymore because they 

208
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,980
can get the answers at their fingertips,
slept well.

209
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:12,981
It's not that you don't have to read,
but man information is flowing so much 

210
00:10:12,981 --> 00:10:16,611
quicker now.
Like if you knew you had a question for 

211
00:10:16,611 --> 00:10:18,891
Google,
it'll be like a really hard thing to do 

212
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:21,591
to research the question and there was 
like a lot of people who developed some 

213
00:10:21,591 --> 00:10:24,801
really good bullshit arguments back in 
those days and the they don't hold up 

214
00:10:24,801 --> 00:10:25,650
anymore because of Google.

215
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,760
Wikipedia is not necessarily always 
right over here in the argument.

216
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,870
Yeah,
there's always a.

217
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:31,490
yeah,
that's a.

218
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,840
that's a big one.
People love to say that there's,

219
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,150
but there's always gonna be people 
downplaying it,

220
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,940
but the bottom line is it's no one knows
everything.

221
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:43,410
It's impossible and you could find some 
more and more things because of this.

222
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:44,620
Like,
this is amazing.

223
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,570
This is a great time to be alive.
This is your phone.

224
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:51,390
You fucking pick up your phone.
Do you talk to him?

225
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,650
Tell him to go to websites for you.
I mean,

226
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,030
this is where we.
Have you ever used that google voice?

227
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,160
Oh yeah.
He beat the shit.

228
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,730
You press it and you say dom irrera and 
it'll go right to your website.

229
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,960
Pulls up.
I liked the one where you'd go call 

230
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:07,960
called Joe.
Oh yeah,

231
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,670
that's true.
Yeah.

232
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,250
Yeah.
They go,

233
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,730
yeah.

234
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,400
They,
almost all of them also have the ability

235
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:19,401
to read text so you can,
you can talk to it a write shit down for

236
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:21,720
you,
which is a really helpful,

237
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,770
like you ever used that?
Um,

238
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,670
that note thing on the iphone.
Uh,

239
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:27,350
yeah.
Oh,

240
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,190
it's beautiful.
You can talk to it dom,

241
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,400
like I can press this button and say my 
rare is a bad motherfucker and it 

242
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,310
literally will say,
damn,

243
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:39,270
I rare is a bad motherfucker.
I was trying to get a porn this morning.

244
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,400
Oh,
you said it was on your phone.

245
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:46,430
They'll know a direct TV and it was 
because it was cougars seeking kittens,

246
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,400
which I don't know.
I find very erotic.

247
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,800
Like the older women that like young 
girls.

248
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,740
Really?
Yeah.

249
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:58,290
Yeah.
So I'm looking at the fucking thing.

250
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:01,240
Wouldn't listen to my phone number.
I kept saying six,

251
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:01,750
nine,
four.

252
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:02,500
She goes six,
nine,

253
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:03,830
five and then I'm getting mad at the.

254
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:09,530
When you open up your fucking years,
six nine for you fucking Douche bag.

255
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,300
This is what you get for trying to buy 
porn.

256
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,720
I know why you're trying to buy porn.
It was super specific.

257
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:22,370
Yeah,
and I just think I'm too lazy to 

258
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:22,370
download it and Shit.
I hear you.

259
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,490
It's always much easier to use that 
credit card.

260
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,880
Yeah,
it is because they just send it to your 

261
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,850
bill.
You don't even have to read the letters.

262
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,540
Go Rogan.ting.com.
And Save Twenty five bucks.

263
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,870
It's a credit.
What is the jail cell phone company with

264
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:42,871
no contracts?
I like to know contracts and because 

265
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:42,871
that's another commitment in life.
I'd rather not me.

266
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,220
Why do you need it for cell phones?
That always bugs me.

267
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,890
That's gross one.
And they keep adding a couple of years.

268
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:50,980
Every time you take it back to you 
motherfuckers.

269
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:53,360
Dom irrera team doesn't do that 
conspiracy.

270
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:58,390
They also,
they save you money on a bell by if you 

271
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:58,810
don't use,
like if you use under your minutes,

272
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,460
they credit you the difference in the 
next bill,

273
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,640
they bump you down to a lower level and 
they credit you the difference.

274
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,210
So it's an awesome company.
The grant a,

275
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,130
check them out on it.
Dot Com is our last sponsor.

276
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:14,180
If you go go to o,
n n I t if you haven't been there in a 

277
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,560
while,
there's a lot of new shit,

278
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,950
especially in the strength and 
conditioning department.

279
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,470
We have these primal bells now,
which are insane.

280
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,940
They're the coolest fucking Kettlebell 
and the history of the universe.

281
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,400
Um,
we uh,

282
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:32,430
had the idea of doing kettlebells with 
these evil chimpanzee faces on them.

283
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,240
And this,
uh,

284
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,380
this chimpanzee's face.
Can you pull that face up?

285
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:43,390
Jamie Chimpanzee's face?
It just looks like he's about to fucking

286
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:45,490
kill you.

287
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,320
Can you see it?
Oh,

288
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,120
I see.
Oh,

289
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,510
I love that thing because when I work 
out with it,

290
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,780
I pretend that I'd have to fight that 
thing to the death.

291
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,800
That's what I do when I work out.
What's the fear of God into you?

292
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,810
It was amazing how much stronger they 
are.

293
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:03,060
The not.
It's not even.

294
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:07,390
It's we're so silly because they look 
kind of the same size as us.

295
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,320
She gets super confused,
but we are made out of Jello.

296
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,560
Okay.
And that,

297
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,650
that thing is coated steel.
The chimpanzees are stupid,

298
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:22,651
strong,
like we can't even get it around our 

299
00:14:22,651 --> 00:14:22,651
head.
It's,

300
00:14:22,651 --> 00:14:23,080
it would be so strong that once it 
grabbed a hold of you,

301
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:26,320
you would feel so helpless.
You'd feel so helpless.

302
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,040
A 150 pound champ was like a 500 pound 
man.

303
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,080
I've written one that ate that woman's 
face.

304
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,260
Oh Jesus.
There's so terrifying.

305
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,260
These fucking things.
So to have one as a Kettlebell is the 

306
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,040
shit son and it's only 36 pounds and 
you're like,

307
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,600
Joe Rogan,
I aint no pussy.

308
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,530
And I'm like,
dude,

309
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,560
I didn't say you were.
But the reality is I have a workout for 

310
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,480
you that will work with that 1:35
pound Kettlebell.

311
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:57,290
I guarantee you it'll kick your ass.
So the extreme kettlebell cardio DVD,

312
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,300

kettlebell too,

314
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,030

but I'm sure it's awesome.

315
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,180
That Guy Keith Weber is a bad 
motherfucker and it's a great way to 

316
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:12,620
like you forced yourself to just keep up
with them.

317
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:18,010
Just force yourself to do what he's 
doing and it'll just kick your fucking 

318
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,820
ass.
I'm built like that under my president 

319
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:21,820
buddy.
I know dumb or wherever you're in the.

320
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,440
It's in the right underneath my layer.

321
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,230
We're going to get you a using the 
fucking medicine ball,

322
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,990

323
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:34,740

black butte porter.

326
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:49,991
That stuffs that shit.
I said I said black but black but 

327
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:50,450
stupid.
How dare you.

328
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,290
But let's basically it should be like,
but t t e,

329
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,420
why is that butte?
Why is it because the White House,

330
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,360
the street not called Houston Street.
That's a good fucking question.

331
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,030
God dammit.
I got questions as well.

332
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,190
I got a lot of observations like other 
comedians.

333
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:08,230
Really.
Mine are funny.

334
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,690
Just observations.
Someday I'm going to upgrade them.

335
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,530
We're going to end this commercial right
here.

336
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,590
Now this was a commercial for the

337
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:23,150

ever seen in my life for life,

340
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,640

If you already starting to call it.

341
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:35,290
That's how you say it,
but the reality is you have a cult.

342
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,490
This is a podcast.

Joe Rogan podcast.
My long time friend,

356
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,310
one of my longest friends in the history
of my life.

357
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,890
Diamond.
I had been friends for shit,

358
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,810
it's been at least 20 years now.
We're,

359
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,010
yeah,
it's crazy.

360
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,200
It was 20 years,
right?

361
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:33,380
And we get you up in Montreal.
That's the first time I remember.

362
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:35,470
I think it was 93.
Yeah,

363
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,210
I think that was 93.
And then we met in uh,

364
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,230
Amsterdam billiards.
And uh,

365
00:17:41,231 --> 00:17:42,370
you know,
we talked for a little bit.

366
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:44,290
I didn't know you played football and I 
was all excited.

367
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,740
There's only a few of us that play pool 
like Ferrara and for our place.

368
00:17:47,741 --> 00:17:52,741
Really good pool.
Emonds fitzsimmons plays really good 

369
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:52,741
pool.
Already.

370
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:52,890
Plays Good Pool.
Yeah.

371
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,070
I would get so excited.

372
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,980
I remember bringing you up thinking this
is a new breed of convenience.

373
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:03,981
This kid looks like a fucking tough kid.
Even when I didn't know you were in the 

374
00:18:03,981 --> 00:18:03,981
martial arts,
just thinking.

375
00:18:03,981 --> 00:18:04,920
I mean you were funny.
You were always funny.

376
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,410
I'm not just stroking you,
but remember bringing it up,

377
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:11,630
thinking st the fucking kid who had 
problems with his mother talks about is,

378
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,160
you know what I mean?
Because it was a different.

379
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,600
I told you this before,
you're a group of comedians were like 

380
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,820
more tougher men.
I grew up in a lot of like nebbishy 

381
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:22,820
Kinda.

382
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,750
Well I,
I grew up doing comedy.

383
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:29,751
I started out in Boston and that,
those guys that's particularly meeting 

384
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:29,751
ground.
Yeah,

385
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:30,770
they are particularly manly.
You know,

386
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,850
who made me think that I could do it 
honestly,

387
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:37,851
like who?
It didn't make me think that the way I 

388
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:37,851
looked would be an impediment was nick 
Depaulo oh,

389
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:42,831
okay.
Because Nick Depaulo was great head of 

390
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:45,651
hair,
so fucking devastatingly handsome guy 

391
00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:45,651
who's way better looking than me and he 
was bigger than me.

392
00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:46,560
It's a big,
like a football player.

393
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,140
Yeah,
he was,

394
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,020
he was hilarious and I was like,
it was a weight off my shoulders because

395
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:57,021
I remember thinking that I looked like,
like an athlete or something and it 

396
00:18:57,021 --> 00:18:57,021
looked like a jock,
you know,

397
00:18:57,021 --> 00:19:02,000
if you look at good jock,
like you automatically categorized and 

398
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,760
it automatically makes you less funny.
Yeah,

399
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:03,330
yeah.
No,

400
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:04,500
it's definitely.
I mean there's like,

401
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,300
look at Gary.
Gary Goldman.

402
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:07,680
Yes.
Perfect example.

403
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,620
Beautiful Man to talk to.
Yeah.

404
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,630
Beautiful.
Perfect.

405
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,780
He's cute.
You don't like about hips?

406
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,190

Fucking devastatingly handsome,

407
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,660
man.
He's big,

408
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,280
handsome.
One time.

409
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,900
Kightlinger.
He's Hunky.

410
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,780
He's,
I'd like to take into a prison cell.

411
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,180
Uh,
Laura Kightlinger,

412
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,470
right?
We're an Ireland.

413
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,460
Remember?
Sure.

414
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,450
Yeah,
very funny.

415
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,660
Very pretty word.
She's dressed.

416
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,810
It looks like a fucking model and she's 
dying on stage and she's really fun.

417
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,860
She goes,
what happened?

418
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:39,910
I go,
you look too good.

419
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:45,380
The guys can't laugh at you.
The girls don't think you're funny 

420
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,031
because you're too pretty and the guys 
can't live because their girlfriends or 

421
00:19:48,031 --> 00:19:48,040
looking at them,
see if their left and looking at you.

422
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,680
Do you know Brian Frazier?
Do you remember?

423
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:54,130
Brian Frazier from Boston probably 
stopped doing standup,

424
00:19:54,131 --> 00:19:54,480
but uh,
he,

425
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,490
he writes,
we,

426
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,540
I haven't spoke to him quite a bit,
but uh,

427
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,940
he at one point in time was enormous.
He was a bodybuilder and he,

428
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,560
I mean he was super.
He like,

429
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:09,930
he's one of those super dedicated super 
disciplined dudes that can force himself

430
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:13,360
to work an hour and a half a day and eat
strictly healthy.

431
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,880
He was fucking drunk.
I mean,

432
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:20,881
he was huge.
Then you would go on stage with like a 

433
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:20,890
golf shirt on and I had a poem sign,
Dude,

434
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,190
you can't wear that.
Right?

435
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,260
And he's like,
why?

436
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,730
And I go,
because you're too big.

437
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,660
I go,
trust me,

438
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,520
I go,
you got to try to stay in this.

439
00:20:27,521 --> 00:20:28,690
I guess I go,
dude,

440
00:20:28,691 --> 00:20:29,050
I,
I,

441
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:31,540
you know,
you're my friend and uh,

442
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,800
you make me nervous.

443
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,850
Like you're fucking arms are gigantic.
They had like bouncing in his arms.

444
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,320
They were too big.
He couldn't stop.

445
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,100
He couldn't not look at them.
How about Pisco?

446
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,610
And he got,
let me know those things at the carnival

447
00:20:42,611 --> 00:20:44,680
where you stick your head into the 
muscle man's body.

448
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,330
Yeah.
That's episcopal look like,

449
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,030
yes,
no,

450
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,490
no.
Brian Frazier was bigger than him.

451
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,210
I'm telling you.
Was the big no,

452
00:20:51,211 --> 00:20:51,740
he was.
No,

453
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,140
no,
no.

454
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,740
It's Pisco.
Maybe.

455
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:58,741
Yeah.
But frazier was just like super 

456
00:20:58,741 --> 00:20:59,230
dedicated.
He was like crazy dedicated.

457
00:20:59,231 --> 00:21:02,050
Here's a funny fucking story because he,
he,

458
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,910
he's a really funny guy and he looks 
like baby,

459
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:11,911
like an Irish guy from the midwest,
but he's Jewish and he's,

460
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,890
he at this time had like a really 
fucking.

461
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:15,880
He's,
you know,

462
00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:18,550
he's got a temper and he doesn't like 
people fucking with them,

463
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,810
you know,
he was,

464
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,790
I mean,
he and I never had any problems,

465
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:26,791
but he was a at a Gig and Vermont once 
and we would get,

466
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:32,310
we worked together up there and um,
that he had a little bit of a problem 

467
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,220
with his voice.

468
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:37,720
He had a little bit of a cold and so he 
was saying to the,

469
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:38,620
uh,
to the,

470
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:39,790
uh,
owner of the club,

471
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,790
it was like apologizing for his,
uh,

472
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:47,850
his voice being a fucked up.
And the guy who owned the club said 

473
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,350
something like,
you know what,

474
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,330
what are you being a Jew or something?
Ooh,

475
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,500
something along those lines,
like you sound like a Jew because he 

476
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,710
didn't think he was Jewish.
It was something along those lines.

477
00:21:59,711 --> 00:22:01,390
It was like really crude and you're 
like,

478
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,680
and Brian went fucking crazy.
He went crazy.

479
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,820
It was a desk between him and the guy 
and that's probably the only thing that 

480
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,641
stopped him from smashing this guy,
but he was so scary because he was like 

481
00:22:14,641 --> 00:22:17,070
really fucking strong.
And I remember thinking like,

482
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,870
because back then like I didn't even 
lift weights,

483
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:24,900
like I would die.
I never lifted weights to my window 

484
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:24,900
days.

485
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,480
I was like,
I was pretty skinny in comparison.

486
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,700
He was like way bigger than me.
I was like,

487
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:32,701
God damn,
I don't know if I can stop him from 

488
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:32,701
hurting this guy,
you know,

489
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:33,920
because he's just so much stronger than 
him.

490
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,650
He could just run right through them 
like a bowl.

491
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,680
But that one thing the guy said to him 
like,

492
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,480
don't be a Jew.
Like what are you being a Jew?

493
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:42,160
I forget,
I forget what it was,

494
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,310
but I remember like going,
Oh shit,

495
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:50,610
like that's the moment where you're 
trying to talk your friend at a doing 

496
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,850
something really stupid or the moment 
like,

497
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:54,700
I know how you feel,
I know how you feel and your right to be

498
00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:56,710
upset,
but please don't do anything.

499
00:22:56,711 --> 00:22:59,740
Let's get the fuck Outta here.
If you do something right now,

500
00:22:59,741 --> 00:23:02,980
that's going to be stupid.
It's a mistake and it's going to fuck up

501
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:03,580
your freedom.

502
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,950
You're going to get locked in a cage.
You're not going to do this.

503
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:11,370
There's now civilized people do keep the
fuck away from people if you don't like 

504
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:11,830
them,
but you don't have to beat him up.

505
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,900
You know that.
That gets weird.

506
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,920
I,
I know when you get that look that you 

507
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:18,920
are thinking,
but you don't go into action.

508
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,580
Remember one night we were drunk and 
kids came up to the pool hall and one 

509
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,580
kid just fucking lit you up and I just 
looked at you at the.

510
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,720
I know he ain't going to lose it,
but this kid has no idea that fucking 

511
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:30,720
dangerous.
Well,

512
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,270
he was.
I remember what you're talking about.

513
00:23:32,271 --> 00:23:34,510
It's just drunk men.
Yeah,

514
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:40,010
I mean I couldn't imagine what it's like
to be a woman and deal with the drunk 

515
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,681
man wanting to hold you down and fuck 
you in the same type of like you would 

516
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:45,710
just run into people that are just.

517
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,290
The name did not like that when they're 
sober.

518
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:53,291
I don't know.
I mean some people just have a problem 

519
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:53,291
with drinking.
They just get weird,

520
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,890
but when you're around him,
like aggressive drunk dudes.

521
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,570
It's so unfortunate.
It's like,

522
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,370
oh,
what a fucking predicament.

523
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:03,910
This has got to suck to be a check.
Then they start repeating themselves 

524
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:03,910
and.
But I always say,

525
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,300
look,
the law,

526
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,780
it doesn't bothers me a little bit,
but at least it's not threatening like 

527
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,570
it as to a check.
I really always think about that when I 

528
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,180
see those kind of really drunk,
Douchey guys.

529
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:19,940
It's gonna be a terrifying thing to have
a guy you know want to hold you down.

530
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:22,880
Fuck you.
It is.

531
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,030
It's got to be awful.
Tell me the story.

532
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,570
Tell me the truth.
That's terrible.

533
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,900
I can't take it anymore.
My back's killing me when you were 

534
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:31,900
saying that thing about,
you know,

535
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,140
it's kind of fucked it that still 
around,

536
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:33,590
isn't it?

537
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,400
Yeah.
Well,

538
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,910
you know,
I with my God daughter living with me,

539
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,690
I can't sleep unless she's home.
You know what I mean?

540
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,250
And like honestly my Godson,
he's closed blood.

541
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,430
If he got blown at a party by the kids' 
mother through the Party,

542
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:53,090
I'd go dad that much.
Tell me about it and don't read it.

543
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,850
Don't wrap the lady out here.
But you know what I mean?

544
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:57,530
It's like,
it's so different with girls.

545
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,960
It's totally different.
It's totally different.

546
00:24:59,961 --> 00:25:02,850
I was thinking of something you said 
before about when he said he was,

547
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,960
the guy was Jewish and he didn't know 
how you're part of your culture,

548
00:25:05,961 --> 00:25:08,510
your party background.
I was married to a Jewish woman,

549
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,720
right.
And I one day I said not meaning it in 

550
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,120
anything,
just my own ignorance.

551
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:14,600
I said,
yeah,

552
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:16,550
maybe we can do.
We can do the guy down.

553
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,410
And she said,
that's really insulting.

554
00:25:18,411 --> 00:25:19,970
I go,
why?

555
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,610
And she said she explained it to me.
So then I just start saying,

556
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:25,550
let's Christian that motherfucker down 
just to,

557
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,500
just to bring it back on myself.
That's funny.

558
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,410
<Unk> frazier

559
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,130
got mad at me for using that expression 
of that guy.

560
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:32,660
Yeah,
yeah,

561
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,270
yeah.
I mean they get mad at me,

562
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,460
like threaten me,
you know,

563
00:25:35,461 --> 00:25:36,660
we were friends,
but he's like,

564
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:41,661
you know,
that's really a rude thing to say in 

565
00:25:41,661 --> 00:25:41,661
Atlanta.
But I was like,

566
00:25:41,661 --> 00:25:41,661
you know,
I've always said it.

567
00:25:41,661 --> 00:25:43,080
I never thought of it.
I didn't even think of as a bad thing.

568
00:25:43,081 --> 00:25:44,130
I was like,
you know,

569
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,560
guys got gold chains on always Guinea 
and ended up,

570
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,460
yeah,
no,

571
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,710
you want to get some money on jus the 
guy down it.

572
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,060
I didn't think it was bad to be frugal.
No know

573
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,470
I never connected the two.
I never meant it as a set it.

574
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,150
And then I saw that it was obvious once 
he said,

575
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:01,720
I was like,
yeah,

576
00:26:01,721 --> 00:26:05,860
I guess that is pretty insensitive.
Do you know that they,

577
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,920
they got a guy today,
95 years old who was a Nazi at the one 

578
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,720
of the camps,
95 native rest of them.

579
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:17,030
I think you think he's gonna get life,
but,

580
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,000
but seriously it's.
Did you see it and say that's a terrible

581
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,220
thing for Karma?
That tech.

582
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,310
I lived that large and Tina,
he had 95.

583
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,600
That was a big thing they said.
He said he would.

584
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,650
Yeah,
they all went there.

585
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,740
He said he was a cook at the camp 
concentration camp.

586
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,860
God.
Yeah.

587
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:42,750
You know what's scary about the Nazis is
that that that shit was not that long 

588
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,910
ago.
These guys are still here,

589
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,660
still alive.
So most of them are still.

590
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,790
Well,
that's why I think about when,

591
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,330
when Mel Brooks did the producers how 
fresh that was.

592
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,030
I mean,
how fucking ballsy was that.

593
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,630
Don't be a dummy.
Bah Marty.

594
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:59,631
Come and join the Nazi party.
Remember when they were doing the goose 

595
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:02,781
step dance.
You remember the movie and I was 

596
00:27:02,781 --> 00:27:04,830
thinking that was in the sixties and the
war didn't until the forties.

597
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,240
40th five,
seven.

598
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:07,380
I think it was.
It was.

599
00:27:07,381 --> 00:27:10,830
It 47,
so I thought it was 45 or whatever.

600
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:15,780
It wasn't that far back and he did this 
whole thing about Hitler.

601
00:27:15,781 --> 00:27:18,690
It was fucking hilarious.
And total balls.

602
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,900
Oh yeah,
no,

603
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,140
it was 45.
It ended malpractices.

604
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,870
Bad motherfucker still is.
Still is.

605
00:27:24,871 --> 00:27:28,890
Apparently Brian Callahan knows him or 
knows.

606
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:29,370
Oh No,
no.

607
00:27:29,371 --> 00:27:34,371
It's Fitzsimmons fits fitzsimmons.
Taoism says a guy just fucking hangs 

608
00:27:34,801 --> 00:27:39,450
around because they don't go to a coffee
shop and talk to him.

609
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:42,440
I met him in the street,
like a super personable guy.

610
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:47,710
Just a real nice guy enjoying life.
His fucking son is a bad ass author.

611
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,390
His son is the one that wrote that World
War z movie.

612
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,290
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

613
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:56,160
His son wrote the book,
which I guess a lot of people.

614
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:00,810
I haven't seen the movie yet obviously,
but a lot of people are pissed that they

615
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:03,900
deviated from the book.
Sometimes they do that,

616
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,760
but uh,
yeah.

617
00:28:05,761 --> 00:28:10,761
It's his son's band as author.
He did two of the funniest movies ever.

618
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,280
Young Frankenstein producers blazing 
saddles.

619
00:28:14,281 --> 00:28:19,281
Three to three movies.
Movie Young Frankenstein was fucking 

620
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:19,320
hilarious at the time.
He was a.

621
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:24,350
He was the man,
I mean if you went to see a mel brooks 

622
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,380
movie,
like there's really no one to compare it

623
00:28:25,381 --> 00:28:27,120
to today because he would act in them.

624
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,240
He would.
I always had to sing or something like I

625
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,200
saw high anxiety.
Yeah,

626
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,350
they was singing like a lounging land 
singer.

627
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,620
He's got high anxiety and he goes it 
each time you are near the idea of Zion.

628
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,530
So fucking stupid.
Mel Brooks was a genius man.

629
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:50,660
He was a powerful,
prolific genius.

630
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,920
He tells a lot of really good stuff.
At the time was him and woody allen kind

631
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,250
of like in.
I don't know.

632
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,230
It was more silly.
Yeah.

633
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,320
That's pretty fucking silly.
Yeah,

634
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:00,930
yeah,
sure.

635
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,470
I love the one where he's playing the 
cello and I'm marching band billy has to

636
00:29:04,471 --> 00:29:07,390
run up and sit down for a couple of bars
there.

637
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:13,100
Take the money and run.
If you've seen a mel brooks history of 

638
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,100
the world.
Yeah.

639
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,520
Oh yeah.
It's funny,

640
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,650
man.
It's beautiful stuff.

641
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,990
It's beautiful stuff.
At the time,

642
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,580
like I was just,
there was nobody.

643
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,160
There is nobody else like that.
Making movies like that.

644
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,290
It was like you heard it was a mel 
brooks movie.

645
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:27,090
You knew you were.
It was a certain standard.

646
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,530
Yeah.
Comedy that you're going to get.

647
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:33,550
It's great stuff though.
They could never make blazing saddles 

648
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:33,550
today.
No,

649
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:33,550
they couldn't.
Just political tubes.

650
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,180
Racially charged.
Yeah.

651
00:29:35,181 --> 00:29:37,110
I mean there could never be an all in 
the family today.

652
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,280
It's true.
Yeah.

653
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,620
I don't.
I don't believe that.

654
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,920
And it's sad.
It's sad that people would,

655
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,410
you know,
the good thing is,

656
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,440
look,
it sucks that people like that ever 

657
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,041
exists,
that there really could be a guy like 

658
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:53,041
archie bunker that's at racist.
Yeah.

659
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:53,390
But it's still fun.
My uncle was like that.

660
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,900
We had family members that were like 
that.

661
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,630
There were people that were worse in 
that by the way,

662
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,700
like way worse than you wouldn't even 
give black people credit for being good 

663
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:03,700
looking.

664
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,220
You know what I mean?
Like if a black woman was beautifully 

665
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:08,220
go,
that's a white nose.

666
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:08,860
She got a white note.
You know what I mean?

667
00:30:08,861 --> 00:30:13,861
Like she,
he bring up for white people are 

668
00:30:13,861 --> 00:30:14,470
beautiful and like that's fun,
but it was real.

669
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,370
You know what I mean?
He hate,

670
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,870
he hated like,
you know,

671
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,000
cause I was a kid,
I grew up with the Beatles,

672
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:24,001
he hated the Beatles.
He hated like anything rock and roll 

673
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:24,850
that was ruination of the world.
Well,

674
00:30:24,851 --> 00:30:28,090
you know what time I think I used to 
wonder what the fuck that was all about.

675
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,440
And I think what it really boils down to
is that people have these weird natural 

676
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:38,791
tribal instincts.
They have these weird tribal instincts 

677
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:42,421
and they belong to a tribe.
And whether that tribes being a 

678
00:30:42,421 --> 00:30:46,171
republican or would that tribe is 
listening to classical music,

679
00:30:46,951 --> 00:30:48,730
you know,
wherever the fuck it is that they decide

680
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,170
this is where they draw the line.

681
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,990
This is where they stand.
It's a tribal thing.

682
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,200
You know,
it's,

683
00:30:54,201 --> 00:30:57,460
it's a weird deviations of our need to 
form groups,

684
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,640
you know,
so we'll get upset about shit that 

685
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,501
doesn't matter even a little bit.
I try and not be stuck in any one area.

686
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,670
You know,
the only thing I was thinking,

687
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,380
I don't even know if this is funny or 
not,

688
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:11,650
but where's,
what's gonna Happen in the rock and roll

689
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:16,651
hall of fame in 15 years?
Like when there's no groups left and 

690
00:31:16,651 --> 00:31:18,190
it's like,
rap music is dominant.

691
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,220
Hey,
you know what I mean?

692
00:31:19,221 --> 00:31:24,221
Like,
because they're going to be like a 

693
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:24,221
motherfucker.
This motherfucker minimally.

694
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:24,700
No,
not like any rap music.

695
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:27,300
I do kind of like.
Well,

696
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:30,940
I mean I like,
I like what's snoop?

697
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,550
Snoop is great.
I think I like m and M.

698
00:31:33,551 --> 00:31:38,551
I love some of the music.
What would you like by m and M on 

699
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:38,551
itunes?

700
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:43,500
Yeah.
I couldn't imagine seeing dot Merera I 

701
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,130
get brought up to date.
What do you want to lose yourself?

702
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,380
You lose yourself.
Yeah.

703
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,910
So that's fucking great.
In the beginning is great.

704
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,060
And uh,
just,

705
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,150
you know,
when you get one chance in a lifetime,

706
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,060
don't blow it.
Yeah.

707
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,070
No,
that's a beautiful song.

708
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,810
Yeah.
Now he's a bad motherfucker.

709
00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:57,880
I'm an alum and I liked the one mama 
never meant to hurt.

710
00:31:57,881 --> 00:32:02,881
You never met.
I'm cleaning out my closet is pretty 

711
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:04,270
fucking great.
Fucking songs coming out soon.

712
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,640
Does it really good for him,
man?

713
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,050
He's brilliant.
Yeah,

714
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,970
I think he doesn't like to perform.
I heard that.

715
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,190
That was a problem that doesn't like to 
go outside.

716
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:13,900
Well,
you know,

717
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:15,910
I mean then yeah,
I'll fucking famous,

718
00:32:15,911 --> 00:32:17,200
don't do this.
You know,

719
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,750
he got so famous.
I mean he got crazy famous.

720
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:22,600
He got famous to the point where it's 
probably probably fucks with your head.

721
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,620
Yeah.
We used them.

722
00:32:23,621 --> 00:32:28,621
I was thinking last time we were 
shooting pool and you're very good with 

723
00:32:28,621 --> 00:32:31,501
people,
but the guy got on your nerves because 

724
00:32:31,501 --> 00:32:32,410
joe was just,
we getting tired and we both,

725
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,730
both of us were kind of tired and you 
said I'm a fucking wreck in the balls.

726
00:32:36,731 --> 00:32:38,370
He wants you to take a picture.
She was like,

727
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,120
that made a,
there was no good tie.

728
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,470
The poor guy.
I mean he was,

729
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:47,590
you were nice to him anyway,
but I just knew you weren't in the mood 

730
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,591
for.
It's just drunks in that guy 

731
00:32:50,591 --> 00:32:50,690
particularly.
That was no big deal.

732
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,730
Yeah.
That was just,

733
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:57,890
you know,
someone was just enthusiastic and want 

734
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:57,890
to take a picture.
That's all good.

735
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:02,560
It doesn't bother me at all that what 
bothers me is that the drunk thing where

736
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,970
you know,
the drunk close to your face,

737
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,680
that clunky,
repetitive,

738
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:07,700
they grab you.

739
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,100
I really liked that.
Grabbed my neck again,

740
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,950
I go for the I'm,
I'm cool with everything,

741
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:15,200
but the drunk thing and if it seems like
you're drunk,

742
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,460
it's like,
Ooh boy.

743
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,050
I don't know.
He drunk to.

744
00:33:18,051 --> 00:33:20,880
How close do I get to a stranger?
You know?

745
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
He'd never seen me drunk A.
I've seen you drunk as soon as jack at 

746
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,130
the laugh factory.
Really?

747
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,280
Yeah.
How long ago?

748
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:33,850
At least an hour ago.
An hour to go and I think he's seen me 

749
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:34,810
drunk.
Yeah,

750
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,500
it was.
It was months ago.

751
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,670
Many,
many months ago.

752
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:43,810
One of the last.
I mean I've only been at the laugh 

753
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:43,810
factory and maybe three or four times 
over the past decade.

754
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:44,760
You're not going to come back?
No.

755
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,660
I would come back Wednesday night.
Show mine.

756
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,420
I'll do whatever you're doing.
If you're doing shit there,

757
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:52,700
I'll be happy to do your fucking balls 
with them.

758
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,910
I'd be happy to do it because they are 
likely to do the half hour at the end.

759
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,080
Then we have the interview.
Yeah.

760
00:33:57,081 --> 00:33:58,760
That was fun.
You had a great crowd.

761
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,620
It was.
There were smart people,

762
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,420
you know.
That was a.

763
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:04,880
That was a fun crowd,
but I've been.

764
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,950
I've been to the laugh factory.
I sent like four or five times.

765
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,160
One of those times you were drunk.
You motherfucker.

766
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,350
I was drunk.
What stage?

767
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:13,590
No,
no,

768
00:34:13,591 --> 00:34:14,810
none unstable.
One time.

769
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,440
One time on stage.
I was drunk because I said something and

770
00:34:18,441 --> 00:34:23,441
then when I realized I was drunk I said 
something to go know what the fuck you 

771
00:34:23,441 --> 00:34:24,830
talking about?
He would say like in an attacking way,

772
00:34:24,831 --> 00:34:27,750
they like confused and I realize that.
Fuck you.

773
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:32,540
He gives me an Irish coffee.
You can't give an Irish coffee with half

774
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,010
that.
There's so much whiskey.

775
00:34:34,011 --> 00:34:35,210
The coffee's cold.
Oh,

776
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,350
is that what he did?
Yeah.

777
00:34:36,351 --> 00:34:39,560
And I'm taking flight training to have 
them look up to a damn.

778
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,900
So what does that like five tanks?
Probably five whiskies.

779
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,230
Yeah.
Shots.

780
00:34:45,231 --> 00:34:47,900
Yeah.
At least that links my balls hurt.

781
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,590
You say that like,
Oh,

782
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:54,380
what else makes you out to a restaurant?
Lists that would.

783
00:34:54,381 --> 00:34:55,310
A friend of mine,
you know,

784
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,080
there's guys that make everything 
sexual,

785
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:02,530
like whatever.
And the waitress was fish was taken 

786
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:07,050
along and get you some Zucchini sticks.
This has nothing to do with sex and when

787
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,150
she walks away,
he goes,

788
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:11,720
I'll give you the Zucchini stick.
Fucking.

789
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:17,040
It'd be like not to do with any of the 
tubes that always have that I gave you 

790
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,700
want a sandwich?
Yeah,

791
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:22,700
I'll give you a fucking sell meat ball 
right here.

792
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,180
Like I said,
I'm glad I'm a girl.

793
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,450
I'm bleeding that a girl to be fucking 
scary.

794
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,440
I never seen a girl.
It's such a defined back.

795
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,930
I've seen them.
I've seen some big ones,

796
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,740
but the one who came out last week,
she's got an Adam's apple,

797
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,390
who's,
I forget her name,

798
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,190
that she just went into the pros.
Just the.

799
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,460
I think her team won the national 
championship.

800
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,260
Brittney griner?
Yeah.

801
00:35:52,261 --> 00:35:55,000
When you're going into the pros for what
she was saying,

802
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,060
she.
She's got like a beard on her dick.

803
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,210
So fucking.
She's so mad.

804
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,120
She came out of the closet.
Who is she?

805
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,840
She's.
She was.

806
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,990
She's like the all time shot blocker in 
the NCAA,

807
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,040
the women's division.
She is like a maze is basketball,

808
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,790
but I mean the thing is it was nothing.
It meant nothing to anybody.

809
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:21,010
Then the guy comes out,
the seven foot guy,

810
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:26,110
the twin,
which he didn't tell his twin brother 

811
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:26,110
who was gay.
Did you see that?

812
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:29,970
He came out of the closet,
but he came out of the closet at 34.

813
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,450
This guy is this guy,
but look at her.

814
00:36:33,451 --> 00:36:35,280
Adam's apple.
Wait a minute.

815
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,690
Hold up.
What's going on there?

816
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:37,890
That's a girl.
That's a girl.

817
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,760
Sure.

818
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:43,570
Second.

819
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,430
So she just came out of the closet.
Is that what you're saying?

820
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,330
There's a player who plays in the NBA.
His name is Jason Collins.

821
00:36:51,331 --> 00:36:53,310
He just came out this week in a sports 
illustrated.

822
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:54,800
That was a big deal,
right?

823
00:36:54,801 --> 00:36:57,150
Yeah.
Was he the first gay player ever?

824
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:02,010
It was the first who is actively was 
still might be playing,

825
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,310
but he might not even make a team 
because he's 34 and he's not any good.

826
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:08,010
It's like a third string center.
He might've done it because they've done

827
00:37:08,011 --> 00:37:10,730
it for that.
Maybe he would go preds crude.

828
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:11,560
You're saying?
Anyway,

829
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,040
gay just to for publicity.
That's what you're saying.

830
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,840
Well,
I know he's gay.

831
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,000
I can see by the way,

832
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,730
tie that like,
look,

833
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:23,840
we're ready to put this story to bed,
but uh,

834
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,460
we need to see soccer cock first.
I mean,

835
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,300
this might be a big publicity.
You know,

836
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:32,090
you should pay a cover charge to go to 
the shower.

837
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,920
That's funny.
That's very funny.

838
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,740
That's very funny.
Bill Burr,

839
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:40,380
I don't get them.
I love people that say no,

840
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,720
you know,
just somebody who's jealous,

841
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,370
you know,
there's a lot of bills as good as any,

842
00:37:45,371 --> 00:37:46,310
anything,
nothing.

843
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,440
You know,
there's a real disturbing thing in 

844
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,620
comedy where people don't want other 
people to be good as well.

845
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,750
Yeah.
I don't know what it is,

846
00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:00,170
but we all know a certain number of 
people who have been afflicted by that 

847
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:03,090
voluntarily or involuntarily.
Some of them tried to kick it.

848
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,850
Yeah.
Well Jimmy Brogan's,

849
00:38:04,851 --> 00:38:07,520
one of those old bitter guys and Nice 
Guy,

850
00:38:07,521 --> 00:38:08,750
but he used to write for the tonight 
show,

851
00:38:08,751 --> 00:38:13,751
you know who he is,
and he was upstairs and somebody was on 

852
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:13,751
stage.
A young comic.

853
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:14,600
He was like,
listen.

854
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:15,650
And like I don't get it.
I go,

855
00:38:15,651 --> 00:38:17,300
you know what?
It doesn't matter if they get it,

856
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,430
listen to the audience,
they get it.

857
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,580
It doesn't mean everything's quality,
but give them credit,

858
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,750
you know?
Yeah,

859
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:26,300
that's a weakness man.
It's like the why,

860
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,510
why,
you know,

861
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,730
either like it it

862
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,670
or don't like it,
but you know,

863
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:35,410
to really like focus all your negative 
energy like that,

864
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,340
those people,

865
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:41,340
they become,
it's a horrible aspect to dealing with,

866
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,580
uh,
with other people.

867
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,960
It's like when you're all in the same 
sort of business together and that 

868
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,691
becomes a guy who just for one reason or
another just can't seem to get it 

869
00:38:54,691 --> 00:38:57,220
together.
And so they start spewing venom and then

870
00:38:57,221 --> 00:38:58,990
you're around them.
You pick that up.

871
00:38:58,991 --> 00:39:00,610
Like if you happen to be working with a 
guy,

872
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:01,690
you know,
and he's like,

873
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:07,340
he's just bitter and nasty,
like you can ruin your whole weekend 

874
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,080
depth.
David played in the invincible.

875
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:11,740
He played a character like that was part
of the events Nepalis group,

876
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,920
the guy who was the football player who 
they based the movie on.

877
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:21,030
And it was really interesting character 
because he was so resentful of his 

878
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,170
friend success that when everybody was 
cheering,

879
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,410
you just see him looking in his glass 
and stern,

880
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,050
you know,
like fuck,

881
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,190
he got something else in life and here I
am at the bar,

882
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:31,090
you know what I mean?

883
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:36,470
But at that played it really well.
But it was an interesting cat because I 

884
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:39,001
thought about,
I've seen it with comedians when a 

885
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:39,001
comedian get something,
it's like when I,

886
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,680
when I started out,
I started out with Eddie Murphy,

887
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,580
right,
right.

888
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:46,270
And I was presenting it live and I was 
like,

889
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,730
I was hired for three episodes and I've 
ever told you that.

890
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,830
Yeah.
Uh,

891
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:54,840
anyway,
Eddie became a star and people would 

892
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,120
actually say to me,
does that bother you?

893
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:55,660
That I could.
Now,

894
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:58,810
do you think that if I,
if Eddie Murphy didn't do 48 hours,

895
00:39:58,811 --> 00:40:01,990
I would have nothing to do with me.
It's him.

896
00:40:01,991 --> 00:40:03,790
He did it.
He's talented.

897
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:07,120
But what is it that stops people from 
ever seeing that?

898
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,550
What is it that makes people just go,
fuck,

899
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,560
you fucking knew Murphy.
No frozen the movie beavin better to 

900
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,410

Fucking petty,

901
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:21,060
petty and follow me in Cleveland.
I fucking Burrito.

902
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,010
He was the middle of,
I was the middle,

903
00:40:24,011 --> 00:40:25,060
he was the headline.
I was like,

904
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:25,780
seriously?

905
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,050
We know so many of them and those 
stories are so gross.

906
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,060
The I blew him off the stage stall.
Yeah.

907
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:39,460
And crushed.
Unless they're talking about a decade 

908
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,460
and then suddenly they become cool guy.
Yeah.

909
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:42,850
And you're like,
oh,

910
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:43,980
how bad did he eat it?
Uh,

911
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,620
I,
you know,

912
00:40:44,621 --> 00:40:47,280
I don't like that guy plates.
I'll show,

913
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:48,640
you know,
I don't like Bobby Collins.

914
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,600
Right?
Yes.

915
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:54,601
And then I like,
there's only three guys I really don't 

916
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:55,270
like in comedy and he's one of them.
And uh,

917
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,150
I,
I did this benefit,

918
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:03,360
it's called rags to riches in Vegas.
It's all these rich Jews in the Tang 

919
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,960
garment guys.
Fucking hilarious crowd.

920
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:05,680
They're all,
you know,

921
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,450
like they'll think they're funny.
They're fucking.

922
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,500
And Bobby Collins was there last year,
right?

923
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,740
And I said that.
I said,

924
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:16,770
no matter how bad I do,
I know I'm not going to be worse than 

925
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:16,870
fucking Bobby Collins.
Right.

926
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:20,000
And they fucking cheered because he had 
a tough set.

927
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,900
This isn't on the air.
I know on the Internet.

928
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:31,380
It only reaches a whole world of people.
So it's a weird group.

929
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:34,930
I love that.
Um,

930
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,940
that they listened to the in Ireland.
Like I told you,

931
00:41:36,941 --> 00:41:38,870
I'm gonna be in Kilkenny in three weeks.
Yeah.

932
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,920
Well that's one of the most beautiful 
things about the internet as he can get 

933
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,961
shit from anywhere.
You can listen to a podcast like London 

934
00:41:46,961 --> 00:41:46,961
real.
Those guys do one from London.

935
00:41:46,961 --> 00:41:51,611
You can listen to a podcast from 
Switzerland or Iceland or fucking 

936
00:41:51,611 --> 00:41:55,430
fucking cool.
Take it so much power away from the man 

937
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:59,770
when you think about it.
Think about like was my main man.

938
00:42:00,981 --> 00:42:03,140
You killed him.
Yeah,

939
00:42:03,141 --> 00:42:06,590
it definitely does.
And every comic has a podcast now.

940
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,300
It's like,
yeah,

941
00:42:07,301 --> 00:42:11,360
there's every comedian that I know has a
podcast that funny to me using.

942
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:16,510
Yeah.
It's like having a podcast is like 

943
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:16,510
having a twitter account.
It's like having an act.

944
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:21,500
You can have an act,
but it doesn't mean it's going to be 

945
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:21,500
that good.

946
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:21,500
No,
but that's true.

947
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,090
But it also would like,
it Kinda,

948
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,730
it's like it's another part of your act 
sort of,

949
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:30,780
you know,
Jamie and I were talking about that 

950
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:30,780
before,
before you came in and I asked him,

951
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,400
it was kinda awkward,
but I had to ask them,

952
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,980
Hey,
do you have eye makeup on?

953
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:38,400
It's just a beautiful man.
It's eyes.

954
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,040
Nothing,
nothing.

955
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,590
Not that I was like restaurant on them.
I'm just saying like glance by,

956
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:45,980
uh,
his eyes look like he had makeup on.

957
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:47,960
It's just beautiful.
It was beautiful.

958
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,450
The um,
the idea that you're,

959
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:51,410
you're,
um,

960
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:54,680
podcast is a part of your act.
I mean it's like,

961
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,650
it's uh,
when you're doing stand up,

962
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:02,710
you know,
one thing that you're selling almost 

963
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:02,710
more than anything.
It's like a point of view.

964
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:07,270
It's like one of the beautiful things 
about watching the guys that you get 

965
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:07,780
your lock into the waste thinking and 
he'd go,

966
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:08,940
oh,
I see what he's,

967
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,460
you know.

968
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:13,320
And then he started laughing.
But you're,

969
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,470
you're,
you're locked into a point of view.

970
00:43:15,471 --> 00:43:20,471
You know,
you figured out a way to lock into his 

971
00:43:20,471 --> 00:43:20,471
point of view.
Well,

972
00:43:20,471 --> 00:43:20,870
it's cool to do something without your 
act,

973
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:22,340
you know,
people get like,

974
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:23,650
you know,
uh,

975
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,950
I told you not to struggle,
but you were,

976
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:29,840
you were because of the power of your 
podcast and your popularity,

977
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:33,740
you were by far the biggest act we've 
had on as far as numbers went.

978
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:34,970
Wow,
that's awesome.

979
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:40,500
We've had a lot of good guys dot Merera 
live from the laugh factory podcast 

980
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:44,270
Jamie was on today were really good.
You're so well.

981
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,650
The thing about you is,
hey,

982
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,150
we'll just give you each a little 
massage.

983
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,380
She always will and celebrate each 
other.

984
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,760
You just,
uh,

985
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:53,870
you know,
you're the real deal.

986
00:43:53,871 --> 00:43:56,480
So you don't bullshit things.
You don't fake things.

987
00:43:56,481 --> 00:43:57,120
It's really dumb.

988
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,870
I rarely they're talking.
Some people for whatever reason,

989
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,150
can't do that.
They get weirded out if they're doing an

990
00:44:02,151 --> 00:44:03,590
interview or they,
they,

991
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:06,410
they have that hard time.
Just completely be in themselves.

992
00:44:06,411 --> 00:44:08,450
But you don't know.
You don't have a punchline every fucking

993
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:10,190
sentence.
Well,

994
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:12,890
you know that,
but there's a lot of guys who don't,

995
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,300
you know,
they get nervous.

996
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,910
You thing I love about you,
dom,

997
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,880
is that you stayed,
you always stayed true to stand up.

998
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,220
Stand up is always the big thing for 
you.

999
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:27,460
No matter what you did.
Like he would occasionally do a TV show 

1000
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:27,460
or you know,
you'd like,

1001
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,210
it'd be great if I got a series,
but you know,

1002
00:44:29,211 --> 00:44:30,950
I'm a stand up comic.
That's what I do.

1003
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,420
And you've always loved it and you're 
always writing new shit.

1004
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,810
You're always improving.
I still love you still love it.

1005
00:44:36,811 --> 00:44:39,030
And you still come up with new shit all 
the time too.

1006
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,460
That's like so important.
It's so,

1007
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,240
it's such a,
um,

1008
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:47,200
it's like a,
it's a rare little sort of group of,

1009
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:49,680
of,
of people that we know that like really,

1010
00:44:49,681 --> 00:44:52,180
really love and appreciate the artist's 
stand up.

1011
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:56,220
Does fuck does.
Fuck already does.

1012
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:57,300
It does.
Yeah.

1013
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,580
Yeah.
I went on after Brian the other night at

1014
00:44:59,581 --> 00:45:00,470
the laugh factory.
Hey,

1015
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:05,550
terrific sense.
I'm busting busting the crowd and say 

1016
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:08,610
some nice to follow Brian because he 
sets the bar so low or whatever.

1017
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:13,620
You know,
he starts hollering and made from 

1018
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:13,620
upstairs.
They know we're fucking friends.

1019
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,210
I wouldn't do it like,
you know,

1020
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:16,980
like when I host a show,
I said the true sign,

1021
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:19,680
I don't like a person so if I give them 
a straight nice intro,

1022
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,520
if I'm being nice,
just give it.

1023
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,780
That means I don't like,
I don't have time for.

1024
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:30,450
And what people don't understand too 
well if we bust each other's balls and 

1025
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:31,620
it's really like a pleasure.

1026
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,460
It's fun.
Yeah.

1027
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,990
Like if you say some stupid shit about 
me,

1028
00:45:33,991 --> 00:45:36,180
if I say some stupid shit about you,
we enjoy it.

1029
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:41,360
Of course.
Like we make each other laugh and some 

1030
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,181
people don't see that.
Like they see like two comics busting 

1031
00:45:44,181 --> 00:45:46,500
his balls and they think like oh they 
are asserting dominance and hurting each

1032
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:47,600
other.
No,

1033
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,940
they're having fun.
And the fact that they can do it to each

1034
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:52,230
other,
you know,

1035
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:57,340
and it's part of being a comic.
The busting balls thing is a part of 

1036
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:01,731
being a competent.
Well when you said something a couple 

1037
00:46:01,731 --> 00:46:04,050
minutes ago about the guys who seriously
talk about themselves in comedy,

1038
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:05,790
like,
you know what I mean?

1039
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,350
First of all,
I'm not bragging,

1040
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,840
but I was incredible.
I read them,

1041
00:46:09,841 --> 00:46:14,841
he couldn't follow up anytime.
They should have a music act when they 

1042
00:46:14,841 --> 00:46:14,841
have to make,
just to comedy.

1043
00:46:14,841 --> 00:46:14,940
The lydian stand.

1044
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,290
There was a guy that he shoved,
her name may remain nameless,

1045
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,690
who already had a website.
We were on a podcast or a website and in

1046
00:46:23,691 --> 00:46:24,870
his website Id,
uh,

1047
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:29,920
it had a whole shopping college about 
how we blue dice off the stage following

1048
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:33,780
who would that be?
Oh,

1049
00:46:33,781 --> 00:46:38,781
I don't know,
but the fucking silly is shit I've ever 

1050
00:46:38,781 --> 00:46:38,781
read.
I was like,

1051
00:46:38,781 --> 00:46:40,410
okay,
what are you talking about?

1052
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,140
Like one of the things I like about the 
ice,

1053
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:46,380
there's nothing phases him Wednesday,
he doesn't give a fuck.

1054
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,050
He did that special he,
he aired that,

1055
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:53,850
that two CD special called the day the 
laughter died and he went up,

1056
00:46:53,851 --> 00:46:56,670
essentially went up or danger fields in 
New York unannounced.

1057
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,810
No one knew he was going there.
And if you've ever been to Dangerfield,

1058
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,520
danger fields.
When I was a kid,

1059
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:06,120
when I first came to New York,
I fell in love with danger fields.

1060
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:11,150
That was my spot in New York City.
It was the nightclub was an all time 

1061
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:11,790
nightclub.
It was off the beaten track.

1062
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:16,820
They give you a half an hour.
The crowds were very small except like 

1063
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:19,930
weekends and like sometimes like prom 
shows were like pack there,

1064
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,290
but you,
it was,

1065
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:25,350
it was where they filmed the Rodney 
Dangerfield,

1066
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:28,350
hbo special.
To me that was,

1067
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,610
it was,
it was Mecca in New York.

1068
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,290
You know how I went there all the time,
but you,

1069
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,980
you had to work with some really fucking
crazy people.

1070
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:39,300
Who is this Scottish guy who was the 
bouncer owner,

1071
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:41,210
whatever.
Jimmy,

1072
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:46,670
he was a character.
He looked like he was sitting down and 

1073
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:49,300
we understand that he was so squad.
He was a brick house falling ball.

1074
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:51,610
He was a brick house.
That guy was gigantic.

1075
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,360
Don't get a fucking left for folk sick.
He was a power lifter.

1076
00:47:55,361 --> 00:47:58,960
That dude,
he would like grab people and throw them

1077
00:47:58,961 --> 00:47:59,070
out.

1078
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:02,640
There was a gentleman until someone 
wasn't a gentleman time,

1079
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:06,670
you fucked up.
Like he noticed he was a big guy,

1080
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,020
but he was like deceptively straw,
right?

1081
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,470
He would do crazy weight lifting things.
He had,

1082
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,720
um,
like cement buckets,

1083
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,180
buckets,
buckets,

1084
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:16,720
yeah.
Yeah.

1085
00:48:16,721 --> 00:48:19,600
He had them filled with cement and he 
would do exercises with them.

1086
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,270
He did power lifting,
did a lot of crazy shit.

1087
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:27,270
That guy was stupid strong,
but he was perfect for the nightclub and

1088
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:32,110
he was hilarious too.
He was always going to try again,

1089
00:48:32,111 --> 00:48:37,111
would that shite activists balls,
but it was warm,

1090
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:40,030
you know,
and it's like he would do it with like a

1091
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:42,010
half a smile on his face and he's like,
hey man,

1092
00:48:42,011 --> 00:48:44,200
I'm just trying to do my thing.
And he would laugh.

1093
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:49,560
He was a good dude,
but if you ever got in a tussle with 

1094
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:49,560
that guy,
oh my God,

1095
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:49,560
he was terrified.

1096
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,860
He,
I saw him pick a guy up by his neck.

1097
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:56,250
He grabbed the gun but in the back of 
the neck and just hoisted him up in the 

1098
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:56,250
air,
but he's essentially doing it completely

1099
00:48:56,250 --> 00:49:00,910
by his neck to his prom shows.
Kids would come in and they would get so

1100
00:49:00,911 --> 00:49:03,160
fucked up.
Oh yeah.

1101
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,920
They were so fucked up.
Do you remember Al Lubell?

1102
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,430
Yeah.
A kid went on stage,

1103
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:12,850
took the microphone away from Alabama 
and blue cigar smoke in his face.

1104
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:15,520
Wow.
It was crazy what I'll do.

1105
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,820
He didn't know what to do.
I didn't want to get into physical 

1106
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:20,820
confrontation with him and I was a 
lawyer.

1107
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:20,820
I've ever.
Yeah.

1108
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:21,210
Yeah.
So he,

1109
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,440
he,
he backed away and you know,

1110
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:28,560
I don't remember what the,
I don't remember how it was resolved 

1111
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,961
because this was Jesus.
This was like 1991 or something like 

1112
00:49:30,961 --> 00:49:32,350
that and then empty to anybody they ever
come on stage with you?

1113
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:33,850
No,
no.

1114
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:34,650
You know,
I don't.

1115
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:39,840
It wasn't his fault,
it was just a kid who was like really 

1116
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:39,840
fucked up.
The kid was really big.

1117
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:43,930
It was a big football player looking kid
who's just a really bold.

1118
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:49,670
They were all trying to be superstars.
This was like were at danger fields and 

1119
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:50,710
it was clear that no one really had the 
run of the place.

1120
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,710
It was almost impossible to,
to corral the crowds.

1121
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,360
Oh yeah.
That's really crazy.

1122
00:49:55,361 --> 00:49:57,910
That prom crowd is also.
So there's one,

1123
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:03,210
it's the St Patrick's Day.
It's one day everybody gets fucked up 

1124
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:06,301
and they were tough.
He was the crazy shows I ever worked in 

1125
00:50:06,301 --> 00:50:07,720
my life without a doubt,
because first of all,

1126
00:50:07,721 --> 00:50:11,740
you would work from like the time it was
dark out from like 7:00,

1127
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:15,010
he would do shelf till 2:00
in the morning and then we get off stage

1128
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,320
two in the morning and people told me 
that I didn't believe him,

1129
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:22,270
but it was like it was good money.
Less spot at the Improv used to be 3:45,

1130
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:25,180
3:45
in a weekend nights.

1131
00:50:25,181 --> 00:50:27,070
I remember having 3:30
spots.

1132
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:28,460
Wow.

1133
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:30,140
That is incredible.
But you know,

1134
00:50:30,141 --> 00:50:35,141
I don't know if I've ever told you this.
The first time I did stand up for money 

1135
00:50:35,141 --> 00:50:37,340
was $50 at Seton Hall.
Right now I'm just fresh out of Improv,

1136
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:38,720
Improv group,
all this shit.

1137
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:42,290
And I go up on stage and it girl starts 
heckling me.

1138
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:45,990
She was fucking out of her mind.
So I bring her up thinking right.

1139
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:51,190
The worst thing I could've done.
Then she's laughing hysterically and 

1140
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:51,650
then she starts crying.
Hysterical.

1141
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:53,120
Oh my God.
Like sobbing,

1142
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,100
crying.
And I'm thinking,

1143
00:50:55,101 --> 00:51:00,101
man,
it's fucking standup is harder than it 

1144
00:51:00,101 --> 00:51:00,101
looks,
you know,

1145
00:51:00,101 --> 00:51:00,101
and I don't know what to do.
And then this guy,

1146
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:03,440
you wouldn't know this guy,
he died a long time ago.

1147
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,750
Uh,
he comes up on stage.

1148
00:51:05,751 --> 00:51:10,751
He was like,
he was a real pro and he just took her 

1149
00:51:10,751 --> 00:51:14,711
off,
took an and found out later that her 

1150
00:51:14,711 --> 00:51:14,711
brother's girlfriend was killed in an 
accident.

1151
00:51:14,711 --> 00:51:18,790
So she was fucked up on pills and stuff.
And it was the first time I ever did 

1152
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:19,310
standup and he covered for me.
He did.

1153
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:21,200
He made extra 20 minutes and all.
But I,

1154
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:26,280
you know,
like this my first fucking 

1155
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:26,280
indoctrination.
That is whole new life.

1156
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:26,280
I'm going,
Holy Shit.

1157
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,380
Is that harder than it looks?
Shit.

1158
00:51:30,381 --> 00:51:32,760
Roll the dice.
Never brought anybody up after that.

1159
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:35,720
That's fine.
Uh,

1160
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,200
it's funny on Hart,
standup really is.

1161
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:41,120
But then once you get good at it,
how easy it is.

1162
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:43,760
Well,
it's easy because you can take your time

1163
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:48,850
and you can think like,
you can literally think when you're 

1164
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:49,400
doing an act,
there's wrote,

1165
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:50,240
it's not,
you know,

1166
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:51,080
then you're thinking,
Oh,

1167
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:56,110
if I lose my place,
I don't have a place so I can't lose my 

1168
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:59,561
place because it doesn't matter.
You don't care if you go off and 

1169
00:51:59,561 --> 00:51:59,561
something.

1170
00:51:59,561 --> 00:51:59,561
I,
you know,

1171
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:04,750
you gotta you gotTa always have things 
to talk about.

1172
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:06,800
Yeah.
But I don't know if you don't have like,

1173
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:11,830
you know,
you don't do the exact same act or not 

1174
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:14,210
even close and that makes it so much 
easier because then you know,

1175
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:17,240
you're a freak and that's when,
that's when I think it gets easy.

1176
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:19,520
Yeah.
That is when it gets easier.

1177
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:22,010
That's why I hate doing the tonight show
and shit like that.

1178
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,920
When they have it scripted of what 
you're going to say.

1179
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:28,610
It takes all the fun and spontaneity 
away from what's really unfortunate that

1180
00:52:28,611 --> 00:52:31,790
that's still the thing,
those little seven minute conversations.

1181
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:33,250
Hardest thing I do.
Yeah.

1182
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:35,360
Especially because you,
you're doing it with a stranger,

1183
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:36,910
you know,
even if they're,

1184
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:42,170
I mean,
who's the closest to who you're friends 

1185
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:42,170
with at all those guys.
Craig Ferguson.

1186
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,950
You mean calling in?

1187
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,430
Do you do Conan?
No,

1188
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,120
I do Craig and failing.
So like even though you see those guys,

1189
00:52:50,121 --> 00:52:50,530
like,
you know,

1190
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:53,840
maybe every now and again I really liked
buddies with them.

1191
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,840
It's not like no.
Sit Down with them and be yourself.

1192
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:01,860
No,
but I gotta say the thing about 

1193
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,041
Ferguson,
he never gets to a question and all the 

1194
00:53:03,041 --> 00:53:04,070
times I've done,
I've done a show probably eight times,

1195
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:09,550
never gets.
They asked the head of the preinterview 

1196
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:12,251
and the producers called the segment 
producers and they're so worried about 

1197
00:53:12,251 --> 00:53:12,251
what you're gonna say.
Oh,

1198
00:53:12,251 --> 00:53:14,210
he doesn't know much about baseball but 
he knows about the football and.

1199
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:15,200
Alright,
alright.

1200
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:18,140
And then never gets to a fucking thing.
Wow.

1201
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:23,530
I had one of my most fun moments ever on
television on his show because he asked 

1202
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:24,830
me,
he plugged the date,

1203
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:27,630
my denver comedy works and I had already
done it.

1204
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:32,930
I said,
well you've got to really crack staff 

1205
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:32,930
here.
I said,

1206
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:35,481
I've gotten so hot they have to post,
plug my dates because there'd be a riot 

1207
00:53:35,481 --> 00:53:36,600
if they all knew I was there.
Right.

1208
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,880
And he goes,
and then he says to me from his desk,

1209
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:39,780
look,
we'll start over.

1210
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,840
I go and starting over and he walks 
over.

1211
00:53:42,841 --> 00:53:43,290
I go,
look,

1212
00:53:43,291 --> 00:53:45,780
I got a spot at the lift factory.
I got to get to.

1213
00:53:45,781 --> 00:53:46,210
I said,
I'm,

1214
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,080
I'll do.
I said,

1215
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:50,040
I'll do my little monkey dance for you 
and I'll come over and talk to you,

1216
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:52,590
but I ain't starting over.
And we had like a fake fight,

1217
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:55,170
but it was great because the audience 
knew it was real,

1218
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,840
you know what I mean?
And then I went over to the panel and we

1219
00:53:57,841 --> 00:53:58,520
just fucked around.

1220
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,570
That's great.
Well,

1221
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:03,750
he's a funny guy and he's a.
He apparently does a lot of standup too,

1222
00:54:03,751 --> 00:54:04,960
right?
There's a lot of standup.

1223
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:10,190
Does a lot of road gigs.
I know there's been places that I've 

1224
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:10,190
been where I just said he was just 
there.

1225
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:10,680
It was going there.
Yeah.

1226
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:11,400
Good for him,
man.

1227
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,500
It's just,
uh,

1228
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:17,560
I would,
I would like to see him even more and 

1229
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:17,560
uncensored format for hours,
you know,

1230
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,650
descending guy.
I've only worked with him once.

1231
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,660
He in Toronto,
you know,

1232
00:54:21,661 --> 00:54:23,700
when I really became a fan of hands.
Um,

1233
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:26,550
when he was talking about pretty spirits
to remember that.

1234
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:30,360
No,
what did he say it was,

1235
00:54:30,361 --> 00:54:35,361
I don't want to paraphrase,
but it was right around the time when 

1236
00:54:35,361 --> 00:54:37,320
she kept running into all these problems
and it was obviously something wrong.

1237
00:54:37,321 --> 00:54:39,900
The truth is fucking tailspin.
And He,

1238
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:41,250
um,
he,

1239
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:44,520
he basically was like,
why does everybody care about this?

1240
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,280
Like you're talking about a little girl 
who needs help,

1241
00:54:47,281 --> 00:54:49,480
like a young girl who needs help.
And it was,

1242
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:51,320
it was of,
I mean said little girl,

1243
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:52,650
well,
young lady who needs help.

1244
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:54,860
And it was really kind of,
um,

1245
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:57,300
it was refreshing.
It was like he was,

1246
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,600
this isn't,
you could tell wasn't something that was

1247
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:05,601
like he was posturing and he was making 
an attempt at saying this because he 

1248
00:55:07,741 --> 00:55:09,810
just wanted to achieve some moral high 
ground.

1249
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:14,190
It was a real like,
like it felt like he has a voice,

1250
00:55:14,191 --> 00:55:16,980
he's on television,
let's see if I can just get this message

1251
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:18,540
out,
and it was so right.

1252
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:20,970
It was because it was like,
why is everybody freaking out about this

1253
00:55:20,971 --> 00:55:25,971
young lady who obviously does have 
problems when we're in the middle of 

1254
00:55:25,971 --> 00:55:29,250
fucking two different wars and who knows
what else is going on in the world?

1255
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:31,080
Who knows what the fuck else is going 
on?

1256
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,310
It was like little Lindsay Lohan.
Now it's like she makes the news,

1257
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,850
but it's so,
so weird with that man.

1258
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,880
It's so weird to fix it.
Like to somebody that will knock them 

1259
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,001
down.
It's so weird to fixate on individuals 

1260
00:55:47,001 --> 00:55:47,820
like that.
It's so weird that.

1261
00:55:47,821 --> 00:55:52,821
Yeah,
we'd definitely like to build them up 

1262
00:55:52,821 --> 00:55:52,821
and knock them down.
There's no doubt about that,

1263
00:55:52,821 --> 00:55:55,560
but it's weird how people just get 
locked into that.

1264
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,270
Yeah.
You know,

1265
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:03,080
what's Lindsay Lohan up to now?
It's like once she becomes like this 

1266
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,400
side show,
they just.

1267
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:06,100
There's a market.
It she,

1268
00:56:06,101 --> 00:56:11,101
because it's almost like she becomes 
infected with fame then that fame but 

1269
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:16,130
fucking sucks onto her and she needs it 
sorted to give her money and they need 

1270
00:56:16,801 --> 00:56:20,580
her and people like her to fuel the 
there,

1271
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,860
you know,
the little publicity machine.

1272
00:56:22,861 --> 00:56:24,220
It's fascinating stuff

1273
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:26,470
because they also have an incestuous 
relationship.

1274
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,600
A lot of times some of these 
celebrities,

1275
00:56:28,601 --> 00:56:31,540
they actually choose to get their photos
taken,

1276
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:34,250
the sure they asked to set things.
Oh.

1277
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:37,780
And their publicists set things up with 
to keep them in the,

1278
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,220
in the chatter we have.
Fascinating.

1279
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:45,240
We had Justin Bieber at the laugh 
factory one night and I knew he was up 

1280
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:45,400
there and you know,
he even said a couple of things to me.

1281
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:49,030
I was hosting a really cute little chick
that he goes out with her,

1282
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:52,010
forget she's a singer.
I think it's Selena Gomez.

1283
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:53,900
Beautiful.
I'm sad.

1284
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,690
I know that,
but I do beautiful.

1285
00:56:55,691 --> 00:56:57,700
But anyway,
he,

1286
00:56:57,701 --> 00:56:59,240
uh,
his,

1287
00:56:59,241 --> 00:57:02,890
his manager came up to Jamie to ask me 
to mention that he was there.

1288
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:05,370
I thought that was so unusual because 
you know,

1289
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,070
a lot of times like say Sean Penn comes 
in,

1290
00:57:08,071 --> 00:57:09,760
it just wears a baseball cap down.

1291
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,780
Nothing,
not a word,

1292
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,150
you know,
and his kid one,

1293
00:57:13,151 --> 00:57:14,050
the detention.
I'm thinking,

1294
00:57:14,051 --> 00:57:19,051
how much fucking attention do you need?
Like one of the most famous famous 16 

1295
00:57:19,291 --> 00:57:20,710
year olds ever.
Ever,

1296
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,260
you know.
Well that's,

1297
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,860
you know,
he wanted it to be brought up,

1298
00:57:23,861 --> 00:57:24,530
you know what I mean?
Like,

1299
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:28,410
like I get a hand for him really well.
He's probably,

1300
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:30,760
you know,
it's this thing gets a kick out of doing

1301
00:57:30,761 --> 00:57:35,761
that.
You can just show up places and people 

1302
00:57:35,761 --> 00:57:35,761
cheer him.
I bet he could like do that.

1303
00:57:35,761 --> 00:57:37,750
Just show up at a restaurant.
Gentleman Justin Bieber's here.

1304
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:45,150
That's a fascinating thing man.
It's fascinating to me that people camp 

1305
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:49,530
movie stars and didn't give a fuck about
the guy who's laying in the alley start,

1306
00:57:49,751 --> 00:57:50,410
you know.
It's like,

1307
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:55,230
well he seems like he's handling it way 
better than most people would.

1308
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:56,470
Well,
it's pretty unusual.

1309
00:57:56,471 --> 00:57:57,160
Yeah.
I mean,

1310
00:57:57,161 --> 00:57:58,240
he's like,
yeah,

1311
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:00,400
he says some silly things every now and 
again,

1312
00:58:00,401 --> 00:58:02,320
but he's like 17 years old or 18 years 
old,

1313
00:58:02,321 --> 00:58:03,660
whatever it is.
You should see the girls,

1314
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:07,060
young girls fucking her.
You can't say that.

1315
00:58:07,061 --> 00:58:11,050
I think she's too young.
She's 18.

1316
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:15,040
She sent.
I think you got to lie to yourself.

1317
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,280
What a girl.
17,

1318
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:20,260
17.
You know what I mean?

1319
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:24,850
And it's so key to sing back then.
Don't forget he was only 20.

1320
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:29,560
I semans Christine's 16.
Remember that?

1321
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:36,020
I was kiss those gene semans was just 
17.

1322
00:58:36,381 --> 00:58:39,280
Know what I mean?
The way she looked beyond compare.

1323
00:58:39,281 --> 00:58:44,281
Well,
but this was a gene simmons was saying 

1324
00:58:44,281 --> 00:58:47,230
how he has to have to have you.
That's a great fucking song.

1325
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:51,460
And if you say it's not a great song,
I was like fuck you pitch.

1326
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:52,870
So that's good.
That's a mature.

1327
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:56,770
That's how I handle it.
Fuck you bitch.

1328
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:58,840
You can't shit on my childhood.
And there was,

1329
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:01,600
there were a couple of sweet 16 songs.
Yeah,

1330
00:59:01,601 --> 00:59:03,160
there was a lot of creepy dudes back 
then.

1331
00:59:03,161 --> 00:59:06,280
They got away with ap with 18 people 
died younger back then.

1332
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,280
That's what it was talking about,
the Roman Empire.

1333
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,200
Joe,
what it was five,

1334
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,140
four,
zero people died earlier back then.

1335
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:17,140
It's a known fact that what people could
have said before,

1336
00:59:17,141 --> 00:59:19,050
not before.
Yeah.

1337
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:21,350
Before Google.
That's a big point right there.

1338
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:21,980
A known

1339
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:26,980
fact and like I can just bullshit you 
and there's nothing you could say if he 

1340
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:27,510
was good at bullshit and he'd be like,
all right,

1341
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:32,420
you just don't want to fucking admit the
encyclopedia Britannica.

1342
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:35,510
I read all the volumes.
You don't know if you've read it.

1343
00:59:35,511 --> 00:59:37,360
I fuck.
We're in a quagmire here.

1344
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:39,890
I can't get out of this bullshit 
conversation,

1345
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:41,920
asshole,
asshole.

1346
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:43,460
Just bullshitting.
I know he's bullshitting.

1347
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,680
And then you find out years later that 
he was bullshitting fact.

1348
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:48,070
That's funny.
Those motherfuckers,

1349
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:53,100
those.
It's a known fact guys that talks about 

1350
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:53,100
crazy shit.
Look it up.

1351
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:54,230
I can't look it up yet.
Imagined blend.

1352
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:57,530
If you were like a long time bullshit 
her.

1353
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,700
Like if you.
You're a crazy con man type dude and you

1354
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:04,670
just saw just an excellent bullshitter 
for many,

1355
01:00:04,671 --> 01:00:05,530
many years.
What?

1356
01:00:05,531 --> 01:00:07,610
How pissed those people were when Google
came along?

1357
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,320
Oh,
I know.

1358
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:10,730
Like all the sudden,
you know,

1359
01:00:10,731 --> 01:00:13,220
like if they could make up a name of a 
company,

1360
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,220
make up the name of a corporation,
now you'd go,

1361
01:00:16,221 --> 01:00:17,420
do you have a website?
And they'd be like,

1362
01:00:17,421 --> 01:00:18,260
no,
we don't have a website.

1363
01:00:18,261 --> 01:00:19,430
You'd be like,
Oh really?

1364
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:24,620
I was watching catch me if you can the 
other day where Leonardo Dicaprio is 

1365
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:27,090
just like he becomes a pilot when he's 
79 checks and getting money.

1366
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:32,480
You can't do that shit today.
So I walked into a bank and they with a 

1367
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,130
pilot.
Did he perform an operation too or is 

1368
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:36,130
that the one?
Maybe,

1369
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:36,130
I don't know.

1370
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:36,520
Yeah,
the,

1371
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:40,250
the idea that you could like have a fake
company and get people to invest in your

1372
01:00:40,251 --> 01:00:41,540
fake company and then you get that,
oh,

1373
01:00:41,541 --> 01:00:44,120
where's that money shit that those days 
are.

1374
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:49,170
You mean you have to be really dumb.
I'm sure there's people that are really 

1375
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:49,170
dumb or get,
you know,

1376
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:53,160
the Super Gullible,
older folks are living with mental 

1377
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,751
illnesses to get sucked into a weird 
deals and people that are trying to get 

1378
01:00:55,751 --> 01:00:58,160
a quick buck.
Like the made off thing made up thing.

1379
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,680
I was personally affected by that 
because people I love,

1380
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:04,010
but a lot of people were just looking 
for people that you love lost money.

1381
01:01:04,011 --> 01:01:05,510
It's millions.
Millions.

1382
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:10,570
Wow.
When you love a lot of people that are 

1383
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:12,401
fucking powerfully rich.
I know some people jumping around a lot 

1384
01:01:12,401 --> 01:01:14,510
of money around a million.
Yeah.

1385
01:01:14,511 --> 01:01:17,330
The Bernie madoff thing was,
to me,

1386
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:22,460
you know what that showed that showed 
that this is a crazy system because if 

1387
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:25,700
you guys didn't know he was cheating,
how is it possible?

1388
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:28,510
How is it possible?
Because I know where Ms Scheme and there

1389
01:01:28,511 --> 01:01:30,370
are people still collecting money,
so they were.

1390
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:32,120
They were teased but constantly.
Well,

1391
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:35,720
they weren't just teased.
They benefited and profited immensely.

1392
01:01:35,721 --> 01:01:40,610
Some of them made big profits,
but there's other ones that lost so much

1393
01:01:40,611 --> 01:01:42,020
fucking.
Oh yeah,

1394
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:45,440
that guy just went baller on.
Everybody just had everybody's money.

1395
01:01:45,441 --> 01:01:48,170
I'll tuck that away and just squirreled 
it off.

1396
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:53,180
Crazy fucking sociopathic asshole.
And it's just.

1397
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,970
What are they trying to say?
I was handed a bad guy.

1398
01:01:55,971 --> 01:01:59,030
He's just a victim of circumstance.
Probably a psychopath,

1399
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:02,300
but the idea that it's possible for God 
to do that,

1400
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:07,301
that was so disheartening for me because
I thought that it was more complicated 

1401
01:02:07,301 --> 01:02:10,040
and I thought it was more secure than 
that I saw that had to do with degree to

1402
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:12,210
the people to,
of wanting to be quick,

1403
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:15,110
quickly rich or you know,
and these are people that,

1404
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:15,900
like I said,
that the guy,

1405
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:18,110
I know a lot of people that I care about
them,

1406
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:21,470
but they readily admit they were looking
for a quick buck.

1407
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,440
Right,
of course.

1408
01:02:22,441 --> 01:02:23,790
Yeah.
Well that's what he was promising.

1409
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:28,791
Right.
And he's promising big returns to a lot 

1410
01:02:28,791 --> 01:02:28,791
of people.
Right.

1411
01:02:28,791 --> 01:02:29,400
It's just a shocking thing.
Equity,

1412
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:31,430
how much money he was handling,
you know?

1413
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:32,870
It's really shocking.
Yeah.

1414
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:38,030
And then the wife's trying squirrel 
something away and disappear into the 

1415
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:41,270
night,
or the husband's locked up in jail for 

1416
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:41,270
the rest of his life.
Did one of his sons commit suicide?

1417
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:41,640
I think so.
Oh,

1418
01:02:41,641 --> 01:02:45,570
Jesus Christ it tough shit.
You shouldn't just changed his name.

1419
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,540
Oh my God.
Should have just changed his name.

1420
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,560
His son made of A.
I don't think it was even that,

1421
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:55,110
that sun just realized like,
no,

1422
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:55,650
I think

1423
01:02:57,050 --> 01:03:00,620
especially when you're a young man and 
you know,

1424
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:05,800
probably grow up thinking that your 
family is doing really well because your

1425
01:03:06,801 --> 01:03:11,801
father is a hardworking,
smart man and then he brings you into 

1426
01:03:11,801 --> 01:03:15,521
the business and then somewhere along 
the line they probably had figured out 

1427
01:03:15,521 --> 01:03:19,810
somewhere along the line if they didn't 
know from the jump and then the guy 

1428
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:20,210
couldn't take it,
I guess.

1429
01:03:20,211 --> 01:03:22,800
Or who knows the pressure pressure.
Yeah.

1430
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:27,350
Yeah.
He talked about like billions,

1431
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:27,680
billions and billions of dollars.
Right?

1432
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:33,550
What was the number was?
It was definitely in the billions that 

1433
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:34,160
I've heard.
I think it was a known fact.

1434
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:36,730
Joe.
Jesus Christ.

1435
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:39,440
It's a known fact,
so no fact.

1436
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:44,120
This fucking guy lost more money.
I'm smelling bit ski.

1437
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:49,610
There's a,
there will tell you what Eddie Murphy 

1438
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:53,051
was.
Eddie Griffin was saying after nine 

1439
01:03:53,051 --> 01:03:55,271
slash 11,
but a lot of people don't even know that

1440
01:03:56,541 --> 01:04:01,541
they still are gold under the World 
Trade Center and the subways kept 

1441
01:04:02,481 --> 01:04:04,370
running 24 hours a day.

1442
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:07,260
Oh,

1443
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:10,100
well,
you know,

1444
01:04:10,101 --> 01:04:13,820
he would get high and just crazy shit.
He,

1445
01:04:13,821 --> 01:04:18,821
uh,
he actually thinks he's like a genius 

1446
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:21,220
and I heard him one night at the store 
and then who's going to argue with this 

1447
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:21,590
bit?
He goes,

1448
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:27,070
we got to stop giving our kids and 
compton guns and knives and educated 

1449
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:27,260
like,
first of all,

1450
01:04:27,261 --> 01:04:28,760
who gives the kids a gun?
He come here,

1451
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:29,840
Jay,
Johnny,

1452
01:04:29,841 --> 01:04:31,490
I want you to have a gun and a knife 
here.

1453
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:32,930
Go,
go to school.

1454
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:35,510
And he said,
we've got to start educating them,

1455
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:40,570
given pencils and papers and books like,
who the fuck is not going to agree to 

1456
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:42,890
educate kids?
I don't think they need education.

1457
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:48,040
They need guns and knives.
Eddie Griffin definitely had some crazy 

1458
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:51,401
times,
but I've seen Eddie Griffin fucking 

1459
01:04:51,401 --> 01:04:54,641
destroy.
I saw him in his prime when he did his 

1460
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:57,560
first comedy special.
It was short set,

1461
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:58,270
I believe.

1462
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:01,140
I want to say it was a half an hour,
but it might've been even less.

1463
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,930
A lot of confidence.
God Damn,

1464
01:05:02,931 --> 01:05:05,360
he crushed down around.
He fucking crushed.

1465
01:05:05,361 --> 01:05:08,210
He crushed.
And it was scary talent.

1466
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:11,090
It was a scary level of talent.
And energy that he put out.

1467
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,280
And I remember watching him going,
wow,

1468
01:05:13,281 --> 01:05:16,810
that guy is fucking good.
I remember thinking that.

1469
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:21,820
Like,
that guy's got a lot of power in his 

1470
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:21,820
act.
You know,

1471
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:21,820
it's actually scary.
It was like boom.

1472
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:24,610
It was so good.
So dynamic.

1473
01:05:24,611 --> 01:05:25,740
The way he moved,
you know,

1474
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:29,230
the way pause expressed himself and you 
know,

1475
01:05:29,231 --> 01:05:34,231
he had like moments like that that make 
me think like a fat guy just really 

1476
01:05:34,231 --> 01:05:39,031
dedicated himself to nothing but stand 
up and really went legit and went down 

1477
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:44,701
the path.
He had moments if you could recapture 

1478
01:05:44,701 --> 01:05:44,701
those moments.
Yeah,

1479
01:05:44,701 --> 01:05:45,690
I agree.
I think he had some mental issues to,

1480
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:50,080
with the fucking busy.

1481
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:52,090
It's a known fact that,
uh,

1482
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:57,070
that he had a people of his ilk,
standup comedian fellows.

1483
01:05:57,071 --> 01:05:59,820
A lot of you mother fuckers go crazy to 
know.

1484
01:05:59,821 --> 01:06:01,410
In fact,
Damo rare.

1485
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:06,470
It's a known fact.
Have your mental illness and you'll be 

1486
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:07,030
in funny.
It's not a coincidence.

1487
01:06:07,031 --> 01:06:08,300
Dot Merera.
Okay.

1488
01:06:08,301 --> 01:06:09,760
It's a known fact.
You know,

1489
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:12,430
Joe,
you deal with to compare.

1490
01:06:12,431 --> 01:06:16,150
I don't think I see these people laying 
in the bushes outside waiting to fucking

1491
01:06:16,151 --> 01:06:21,151
stop me.
Eddie Griffin was fucking funny at one 

1492
01:06:21,151 --> 01:06:21,520
point.
I don't know.

1493
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:24,490
I haven't seen any in a long time.
I shouldn't say isn't he?

1494
01:06:24,491 --> 01:06:27,100
Isn't anymore.
Who knows?

1495
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:30,460
Might be out there killing it,
but I don't hear about them much.

1496
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,670
I know that he has a funny guy.
I just don't want a warm guy too.

1497
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:37,990
He's very warm and goodheart who he is a
very friendly guy.

1498
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:43,170
Part of his deal when he goes to a 
comedy club is yes to brand new 

1499
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:43,170
sneakers.

1500
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,120
You ever hear this?
Oh,

1501
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,890
I've heard.
I've heard things like this.

1502
01:06:47,891 --> 01:06:52,891
I didn't know it was him.
I don't know whether they're adidas or 

1503
01:06:52,891 --> 01:06:57,810
whatever it is.
It's a big company and he has to have a 

1504
01:06:57,810 --> 01:06:57,810
brand new pair of white Michael Jordans 
or something.

1505
01:06:57,810 --> 01:06:58,900
I think it's Nike.
Nike,

1506
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:03,400
but a fucking hilarious.
The man that guy goes,

1507
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:07,000
I couldn't fucking find them.
If you write to where,

1508
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:12,180
if you have a thing where you need to 
wear a brand new sneakers right as you 

1509
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:13,300
walk on stage and that keeps you like 
super power,

1510
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:18,430
that might sound ridiculous,
but if you were a young guy and you grew

1511
01:07:18,431 --> 01:07:22,060
up poor when you got a new pair of 
sneakers,

1512
01:07:22,061 --> 01:07:27,061
that was like a really exciting thing.
So it could be that by not wearing the 

1513
01:07:27,061 --> 01:07:29,710
sneakers until he goes on stage,
like he liked,

1514
01:07:29,711 --> 01:07:34,711
he liked a,
makes them feel like with new sneakers 

1515
01:07:34,711 --> 01:07:36,961
on,
like it gives them a little extra power 

1516
01:07:36,961 --> 01:07:38,670
and it sounds ridiculous,
but I remember when I was a kid getting 

1517
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:39,040
a new pair of sneakers was like a big 
deal.

1518
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,720
So maybe for him he like kept that 
tradition Joe.

1519
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:45,070
And it's easier for him if they buy it.
Why don't you buy it?

1520
01:07:45,071 --> 01:07:46,000
Because I want to change.
Um,

1521
01:07:46,001 --> 01:07:48,640
right before I go on stage,
I asked you before it came on the show.

1522
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:53,890
Not to be insightful and intelligent,
not to have any compassion for people.

1523
01:07:53,951 --> 01:07:55,450
And there you go.
You're right.

1524
01:07:55,451 --> 01:08:00,451
That's a good.
I try to have as much compassion for 

1525
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:00,451
people as possible,
even people in the wrap,

1526
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:00,520
our pool game,
Dom Irrera,

1527
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:05,230
people that interrupt,
I can't believe you fucking serious here

1528
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,730
dot Merera and I,
when we,

1529
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,670
when we play,
like we occasionally will joke around,

1530
01:08:09,671 --> 01:08:14,671
but John Plays very good pool and uh,
I played pretty good pool and we have 

1531
01:08:14,671 --> 01:08:16,330
some fun battles.
It's really fun to get excited.

1532
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:18,950
First of all,
we play more than pretty good not to get

1533
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:23,980
the same a b player.

1534
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:27,740
Now you're consistent like a.
for a regular person.

1535
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,680
I'm an a player,
but for a regular pool player,

1536
01:08:30,681 --> 01:08:33,260
I'm a b player.
I just don't have enough time.

1537
01:08:33,261 --> 01:08:35,360
While you're more than an a player for 
regular person.

1538
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:36,040
No,
no,

1539
01:08:36,041 --> 01:08:37,580
no.
I never fucking planning,

1540
01:08:37,581 --> 01:08:42,350
but it ran out nine ball like you.
It's done on a regular people.

1541
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:45,380
I'm telling you.
I played a lot of pull in my life.

1542
01:08:45,381 --> 01:08:46,900
I am.
I beat.

1543
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:51,940
You know what?
It's so funny when I'm not playing 

1544
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:51,940
against you because I get a chance to 
shoot more.

1545
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:52,530
I play better.
Oh,

1546
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:58,410
tighten up.
And then you want to get back on the 

1547
01:08:58,410 --> 01:08:58,520
table.
I can run some packages,

1548
01:08:58,521 --> 01:09:00,920
but I can't run packages like my friends
can.

1549
01:09:00,921 --> 01:09:05,921
So like I have the luxury of knowing Max
everly who's like one of the best pool 

1550
01:09:05,921 --> 01:09:07,880
player.
Very well spar.

1551
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:13,230
Every time I go to vegas and play,
he was fucking.

1552
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,440
Keeps you in the chair and the guy just 
runs down from everywhere.

1553
01:09:15,441 --> 01:09:17,030
He's a monster.
Max Max,

1554
01:09:17,031 --> 01:09:19,730
I believe world.
He won the straight pool.

1555
01:09:19,731 --> 01:09:22,490
A championships at the Derby city 
classic this year.

1556
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:25,190
One of the prestigious a pool tournament
to the world.

1557
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:28,340
I don't know what he randomly be.
He runs 100 balls.

1558
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:29,360
Yeah.
That's incredible.

1559
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:30,710
Yeah.
He's a world class pro.

1560
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:33,380
He's a world class problem yet.
And a sweetheart of a guy.

1561
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:34,980
He's a sweetheart.
Max Out.

1562
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,420
What a nice guy.
I miss him.

1563
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,160
I miss it too.
Who is that?

1564
01:09:40,161 --> 01:09:42,280
Now we will bill your Hollywood 
billiards.

1565
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:47,410
What was the one before that?
We used to go to the gym right off of 

1566
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:50,810
Hollywood Boulevard.
Across from the cat and fiddle number.

1567
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:55,900
Isn't that Hollywood billions?
Well then we went to another place on 

1568
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:55,900
Hollywood boulevard.
What was that quote?

1569
01:09:57,330 --> 01:10:00,030
We went to two places for years to play.

1570
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,130
Second.
Oh,

1571
01:10:01,131 --> 01:10:02,470
I know what you're talking about.
The boss.

1572
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:05,810
A club.
That's the first place we went to.

1573
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:07,790
That place was great.
That was great.

1574
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:12,791
That was a a former athletic club and 
converted into this giant pool because 

1575
01:10:12,861 --> 01:10:17,861
they had the track upstairs.
I used to play on a Saturday tournament 

1576
01:10:17,861 --> 01:10:18,260
there.
He said when I first moved to La,

1577
01:10:18,261 --> 01:10:21,290
they had a Saturday morning tournament.
Was like started at like 11:00

1578
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:23,540
AM I made.
I made good friends there.

1579
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:27,170
That Saturday born into the tournament.
That was when I first moved here.

1580
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:32,800
That was a great place.
Remember they had the like the track 

1581
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:32,800
along the top event?
Yeah.

1582
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,971
I remember we doubled one night.
We took the girls to be and she wasn't 

1583
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:38,210
named Jerry.
Yeah.

1584
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:41,290
I only remember it because she was hot 
and that said,

1585
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:42,170
oh,
that's.

1586
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:47,480
Well that's not sad,
but yeah,

1587
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:48,830
pool was a great thing.

1588
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:54,050
A date,
except if a chick beats you check 

1589
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:55,520
beetroots.
Very depressing pool,

1590
01:10:55,730 --> 01:10:58,250
but there's a thing about a girl beaten 
yet pool.

1591
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:01,490
That's demoralizing for some dudes.
It's funny to watch.

1592
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,640
I had a friend who said,
will you shoot my girlfriend because she

1593
01:11:04,641 --> 01:11:08,840
was practicing a lot and she said to me,
I'm going to kick your ass.

1594
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:10,060
Oh my goodness.
All right.

1595
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:15,060
So first of all,
how she,

1596
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:20,340
uh,
she broke and I ran the table rather 

1597
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:22,090
than.
Yeah,

1598
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:24,690
it was fucking easy.
It was those pockets like this.

1599
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:25,560
Oh yeah.
Right.

1600
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:28,240
It's not like we play on the ball just 
about fits in.

1601
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:30,720
And I ran the table and I go,
Eh,

1602
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,190
so much for kicking my ass.
She goes,

1603
01:11:32,191 --> 01:11:32,820
we're gonna.
Play again.

1604
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:33,450
And Go,
no.

1605
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:35,910
Oh,
fucking it down.

1606
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,810
Saying it's over.
Yeah.

1607
01:11:37,811 --> 01:11:39,330
I don't want that kind of attitude from 
women.

1608
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:41,080
I don't like kind of attitude from 
anybody.

1609
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:46,080
Anybody.
I don't like braggers and I'm going to 

1610
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:46,920
kick your fucking woman that can kick 
your ass in pool.

1611
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:51,940
She doesn't have to be rude about it.
Swimming and kick her ass and pools and 

1612
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:54,090
humiliating for men.
That's a nice woman who's very polite,

1613
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:56,580
who kicks your ass and be like that 
Allison Fisher woman,

1614
01:11:56,581 --> 01:11:57,330
you know,
she has.

1615
01:11:57,570 --> 01:11:59,310
Of course she would kicked my ass for 
sure.

1616
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:00,840
Easy.
She kicked my ass.

1617
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,340
Trust me,
she's way better than me.

1618
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:05,180
Who's the big blue is like a snicker 
champion and she.

1619
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,760
She came over from Europe and just 
dominated woman's pool.

1620
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:09,880
In fact,
here's the.

1621
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:11,940
That's the real problem with pools,
popularity.

1622
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:17,330
This woman,
Allison Fisher is probably the most 

1623
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:20,031
dominant sports person ever in any sport
in any game in women's gender issue and 

1624
01:12:21,391 --> 01:12:24,510
it's not like there's only a few women 
playing women's billiards.

1625
01:12:24,511 --> 01:12:26,340
There was a lot of really good players.

1626
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:27,070
There was like,
you know,

1627
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,330
everybody knows genetically drag because
she's a beautiful,

1628
01:12:30,331 --> 01:12:35,331
beautiful Asian woman,
but there's like a whole gang of like 

1629
01:12:35,331 --> 01:12:38,880
top pros that would tour around the 
country and this woman consistently beat

1630
01:12:38,881 --> 01:12:42,360
all of them on a regular basis.
She was like player of the year,

1631
01:12:42,361 --> 01:12:43,980
like who knows how many fucking years in
a row.

1632
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:49,340
She won the US Open,
who knows how many years in a row or 

1633
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:49,340
whatnot.
It was the US Open,

1634
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:50,520
whatever the W,
Pba,

1635
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:53,520
whatever their version of like their 
national championship.

1636
01:12:53,521 --> 01:12:56,910
She would win every year.
Why are men better than women?

1637
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:58,290
Why?
That doesn't make much sense,

1638
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:00,390
but any sense?
It's just a coordination thing.

1639
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,640
It isn't,
it isn't immunity.

1640
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,800
It can be overcome like women like 
Allison Fisher,

1641
01:13:04,801 --> 01:13:07,770
she could beat a man playing pool cue,
but she.

1642
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:10,690
She wouldn't be at the top pros most 
likely not in him.

1643
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:15,390
It's just a few issues with spatial 
intelligence.

1644
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:20,630
There's something to,
and this is like really theoretical 

1645
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:24,441
stuff.
I think something to the way the male 

1646
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:25,800
mind interprets three d space that it is
a,

1647
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:30,801
it's beneficial for certain things and 
pool might be one of them because after 

1648
01:13:31,021 --> 01:13:34,200
the break pool doesn't really rely on 
strength.

1649
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:39,290
No,
and the average woman could easily a 

1650
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:40,290
stroke,
a ball about as hard as you need to,

1651
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,140
you really don't ever need to hit it 
really hard outside of the brake.

1652
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:49,010
The brake shot,
especially in rotation games or eight 

1653
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:51,441
ball,
it becomes a big issue because if a guy 

1654
01:13:51,441 --> 01:13:51,720
can really smash the rack,
he can make like sometimes you break and

1655
01:13:51,721 --> 01:13:54,230
you make like four balls on the brake 
like that.

1656
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:59,270
There's that Guy Shane van boning,
who's a fascinating character because 

1657
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:01,770
he's the best one of the best pool 
player in America.

1658
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:03,710
One of the best players in the world.
Yeah,

1659
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:08,720
and he's deaf and when he plays he shuts
his hearing aid off and it's not good 

1660
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:11,160
because of that.
But it is an added element.

1661
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:12,880
It's good because he's good.
He's.

1662
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:15,730
He practices relentlessly.
The guy's like super dedicated.

1663
01:14:15,731 --> 01:14:18,490
He's good because of that.
But he's also got this added element.

1664
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:22,420
We can shut that.
The heat on here.

1665
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:23,860
Anything.
He doesn't hear anything.

1666
01:14:23,861 --> 01:14:27,060
So when he's in pro tournaments he goes 
into this zone.

1667
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:28,330
It's kind of weird.
Yeah,

1668
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:33,720
it's kind of weird.
It's really fascinating because it's a 

1669
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:34,450
form of sensory deprivation and people 
have actually decided that it,

1670
01:14:34,451 --> 01:14:39,451
it's a,
it helps them so much that people 

1671
01:14:39,451 --> 01:14:41,581
started wearing like earmuffs and shit.
Got Real Strickland and I know strictly 

1672
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,290
he's amazing,
amazing player.

1673
01:14:44,291 --> 01:14:47,050
He puts these,
these things that like the um,

1674
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:52,110
air traffic controllers were giant head 
things over his head and he plays pool 

1675
01:14:52,331 --> 01:14:53,100
with those lines.

1676
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,950
Even it off with.
Yeah.

1677
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,430
So the senses.
Yeah,

1678
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,310
but he tries to recreate it.
He puts earplugs into.

1679
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:07,880
So he puts earplugs in and then he puts 
these gigantic fucking ear muffs over 

1680
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:10,860
the earplugs and then he plays.
He plays like a man possessed the.

1681
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,550
Both of those guys,
they play scary,

1682
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:15,280
pulls them at that level.
Pool is madness.

1683
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:18,310
Willie Mosconi,
of course I've heard of.

1684
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:23,320
I'm sure because he was the guy that was
the big deal in Philly when I read his 

1685
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:23,560
tray pool all time high run.
Really?

1686
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:25,240
It's like 580 ball,
so I'm like,

1687
01:15:25,241 --> 01:15:26,380
uh,
yeah.

1688
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:27,570
He ran it,
but it was on.

1689
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:30,160
It's a very controversial because he ran
out on a four by eight,

1690
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:34,200
wasn't a four and a half by nine trips 
of a dark I.

1691
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:35,430
yeah,
yeah,

1692
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:37,630
yeah.
Luther last smart guy.

1693
01:15:37,631 --> 01:15:39,430
Who,
if you ever heard that name.

1694
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:40,390
Yes,
of course.

1695
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:41,490
Yeah.
It was a wimpy,

1696
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:42,800
straightforward.
Yeah.

1697
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:43,780
Yeah,
man.

1698
01:15:43,781 --> 01:15:45,610
If there was money in pool when I was a 
kid,

1699
01:15:45,611 --> 01:15:48,490
I would have become professional pool 
player because I was enjoying it.

1700
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:53,520
There's zero stricken with the earmuffs 
on because I was enjoying playing pool 

1701
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:57,841
as much as I was enjoying doing comedy,
but I wasn't good enough to like we 

1702
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:03,430
talked about this.
You would never have the time because 

1703
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:03,430
you're too much of a career.
It believe me.

1704
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:05,400
If you were on a law was a comedian,
you could,

1705
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,620
you could turn pro,
but if you could play for hours a day,

1706
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:13,860
it's so much time and so much effort and
the guys that are playing that are at 

1707
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:18,160
the highest levels of the game,
there's several notches better than me.

1708
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:23,430
It wouldn't be like an easy thing to 
even like do battle with those guys who 

1709
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:26,600
would take a long time when some nine 
ballgames.

1710
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:27,370
I will.
Thank you very much.

1711
01:16:27,371 --> 01:16:30,720
So that's straight pool.
A guy can sit you.

1712
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:33,880
There's nothing you can do.
It's just too bad that that game doesn't

1713
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:36,850
get like it's to me,
it's like a form of meditation.

1714
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:41,910
It's like if I can get into the zone and
I can block everything else out and I 

1715
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:44,260
can move the ball exactly where I want 
it to go and I know where it's going,

1716
01:16:44,261 --> 01:16:49,261
I know how to hit it,
I know what speed to hit it and it gets 

1717
01:16:49,261 --> 01:16:49,870
the right spot.
This is a beautiful feeling to that.

1718
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:50,590
It's a,
it's a.

1719
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:55,890
it's like a a.
you're like enforcing this weird zen 

1720
01:16:55,890 --> 01:17:00,541
state enforcing this state where you 
know exactly how many rotations of 

1721
01:17:00,911 --> 01:17:03,130
ball's gonna go for.
People don't play pool.

1722
01:17:03,131 --> 01:17:08,131
They're like,
should we shut the fuck up about pool 

1723
01:17:08,131 --> 01:17:08,131
already?
Joe Rogan,

1724
01:17:08,131 --> 01:17:10,930
Jesus Christ them for fucking pool 
podcast.

1725
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:13,520
Don't even talk about mma.
Okay.

1726
01:17:13,521 --> 01:17:18,521
Jon Jones broke his foot.
You didn't say a word about on your 

1727
01:17:18,521 --> 01:17:20,801
podcast will be.
I had to show you my shaky hand when 

1728
01:17:20,801 --> 01:17:20,801
you,
uh,

1729
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:21,920
yeah,
that's crazy.

1730
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:24,590
I got this nerve issue.

1731
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:29,010
What did you hurt?
You hurt your shoulder.

1732
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:30,620
I wasn't as bad.
Uh,

1733
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:35,730
I know.
I never heard anything and it's just 

1734
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:35,730
something in the nerve that chiropractor
told me.

1735
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:35,750
He said,
you know,

1736
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:39,230
if it doesn't bother you,
said it bothers my friends board in May.

1737
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:41,240
Do you stretch out or all at all?
And doing fine.

1738
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:42,870
Yeah.
You know,

1739
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:47,330
I dance in my house.
Did I do a interpret?

1740
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:49,950
Modern Jazz?
Do you do any athlete?

1741
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:53,240
All little stair climber,
elliptical machine.

1742
01:17:53,241 --> 01:17:58,241
I didn't like where you're going to tell
you it is very good for the planet.

1743
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:01,860
What do you want a piece of this right 
now?

1744
01:18:01,861 --> 01:18:06,861
And May I come on over here,
let me see if I do I do the treadmill.

1745
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:13,890
I do.
It's a shame when you can't tell if 

1746
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:16,310
somebody ever worked that static.
Do you do anything physically?

1747
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,190
That's not what I meant,
but I was trying to find out what it was

1748
01:18:19,191 --> 01:18:21,110
and whether or not you incorporated 
stretches,

1749
01:18:21,111 --> 01:18:23,540
especially the stretch out your 
shoulders,

1750
01:18:23,541 --> 01:18:25,850
especially stretched on the road,
uh,

1751
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:27,320
after flights and all that.

1752
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:29,630
And you know,
that's good.

1753
01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:30,590
Yeah.
I did the,

1754
01:18:30,591 --> 01:18:35,591
a lot of people don't start yoga things,
lot of whatever I learned from the 

1755
01:18:35,591 --> 01:18:39,641
videos.
That's my favorite thing to do before I 

1756
01:18:39,641 --> 01:18:39,641
go on stage.
My favorite thing to do,

1757
01:18:39,641 --> 01:18:39,641
I do yoga.
Yeah,

1758
01:18:39,641 --> 01:18:44,330
that's my favorite thing to do.
I've tried a bunch of different things 

1759
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:46,370
that feel good before I go on stage.
Hard cardio is one of them.

1760
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:51,400
Hard cardio makes me high.
Like when I really do like really hard 

1761
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,860
cardio before you go on stage for two 
hours.

1762
01:18:53,861 --> 01:18:56,460
I like to do like two hours before.
Especially before,

1763
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,920
like it was a big show.
If I want to be thinking about it,

1764
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:00,920
I don't want to give you energy.
Yeah.

1765
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:02,570
It.
Well it doesn't do,

1766
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:07,190
it just releases some weird endorphin 
with me or like if I do like a real hard

1767
01:19:07,191 --> 01:19:09,140
cardio session where I just feel silly.

1768
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,990
I just saw it makes me Sillier,
relieves me.

1769
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:17,620
It relieves me of like physical tension.
It just makes me sillier and I think 

1770
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:22,120
when I,
whenever I can go on stage and being 

1771
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:24,670
more of a silly mood and the Sillier I 
can feel the more funny I think things 

1772
01:19:24,670 --> 01:19:26,090
are,
which is the more funny and you'll get a

1773
01:19:26,091 --> 01:19:26,990
kick out of it.
Yeah.

1774
01:19:27,190 --> 01:19:29,030
The more funnier deliver it.
Yeah.

1775
01:19:29,031 --> 01:19:30,440
When you get a kick out of it and when 
you're,

1776
01:19:31,490 --> 01:19:34,480
you know,
you're saying it in a way that's a,

1777
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:40,480
that connects with people.
Sometimes it feels like too upset about 

1778
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:43,211
something.
You didn't understand why it connects 

1779
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:43,211
with people.
It has to be a and honest,

1780
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:48,020
an honest balance for why you're pissed 
off or why you're happy,

1781
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:53,040
you know,
because it's got to be an island 

1782
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:53,040
balance.
And if sometimes you know,

1783
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,471
that weird feeling when you watch them 
on stage and they're acting pissed off 

1784
01:19:56,471 --> 01:19:56,471
about something,
but you know,

1785
01:19:56,471 --> 01:19:56,720
they're not really pissed off about it.

1786
01:19:56,930 --> 01:20:01,210
And how that is that mit does this 
airplane food.

1787
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:03,380
Well it's not even that,
like someone like,

1788
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:08,410
just to just fake it,
like whatever it is a fake laugh always 

1789
01:20:08,410 --> 01:20:10,040
at the same time,
you know,

1790
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,440
and I can name you find people that do 
it.

1791
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:16,590
I don't even want to get into the union.
You know,

1792
01:20:16,591 --> 01:20:20,430
when someone's mad for real and you know
why they're mad for real.

1793
01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:22,080
Like you feel it,
you know,

1794
01:20:22,081 --> 01:20:24,690
when someone's mad for real,
you know,

1795
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,760
when they really are upset,
you know,

1796
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:29,190
and you know when someone's faking it 
and when they're faking it,

1797
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:30,960
it's really weird.
Yeah.

1798
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:33,530
It's so awkward,
too much of an act.

1799
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:37,530
And I know a lot of us,
especially when you do it on stage,

1800
01:20:37,531 --> 01:20:38,760
it's like you just,
you know,

1801
01:20:38,761 --> 01:20:43,761
you don't.
If you don't realize that yet or you 

1802
01:20:43,761 --> 01:20:46,641
know,
maybe you just out of sorts that night 

1803
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:46,641
could be.

1804
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:47,430
You're out of sorts that night and you 
just have a bad set.

1805
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:48,930
You're not in the right groove.
I mean,

1806
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:53,640
we've all had those over the years.
I love watching Joey Diaz because of the

1807
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:56,140
jelly is so fucking real.
Yeah.

1808
01:20:56,310 --> 01:21:01,220
There's not a phony bone in his body.
That mother fucker now.

1809
01:21:01,370 --> 01:21:04,020
He's just so pure in that sense.
Like,

1810
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:06,630
Oh yeah,
he's not trying to win anybody over.

1811
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:11,750
No,
he's just trying to be funny to the 

1812
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:11,750
people who love Joey Diaz.
I think he just,

1813
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:15,640
he realized somewhere along the line 
that he was.

1814
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:18,050
He's really good.
He realized he really is.

1815
01:21:18,051 --> 01:21:23,051
Yeah.
He realized that he realized that 

1816
01:21:23,051 --> 01:21:24,731
himself and he didn't give a fuck 
anymore and when he didn't give a fuck 

1817
01:21:24,731 --> 01:21:28,251
anymore,
it's like that's when people really 

1818
01:21:28,251 --> 01:21:29,880
wanted to hear more and so all the 
people around him,

1819
01:21:29,881 --> 01:21:33,930
like if he had anyone around him that 
didn't believe in him at this point,

1820
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,760
they all really have fallen by the 
wayside,

1821
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:36,410
you know?

1822
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:41,420
It's took it a long road for Joey to 
like get recognized how funny he really 

1823
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:41,420
is.
Yeah.

1824
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:46,620
And along the way a lot of people had a 
chance to work with that guy and they 

1825
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:49,341
didn't believe in them.
I was telling people about Joey Diaz in 

1826
01:21:49,341 --> 01:21:49,341
1998.
I was like,

1827
01:21:49,341 --> 01:21:50,730
you fucking crazy.
I'm like,

1828
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:53,640
this guy makes me laugh hard all the 
time.

1829
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:55,410
He makes me laugh hard.
I go,

1830
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:57,330
he doesn't give a fuck.
And he makes me laugh hard.

1831
01:21:57,660 --> 01:22:00,240
And they're like,
he's to this and he's too bad.

1832
01:22:00,270 --> 01:22:04,440
Then this doesn't work and that doesn't 
work and if you can't be in a sitcom,

1833
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:07,140
you know.
My agent called me up and he said,

1834
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:08,280
you like Joey Diaz?
I go,

1835
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:09,090
I love him.
He goes,

1836
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,090
you want to work with them?
I go,

1837
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:12,360
anything?
We're doing the ice house,

1838
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:13,860
the end of July.
That's awesome.

1839
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:14,360
Yeah,
be fun.

1840
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:15,510
That's a beautiful show.

1841
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:18,900
I might come and watch.
You know what I will say is that I think

1842
01:22:18,901 --> 01:22:20,120
it's 27,
28.

1843
01:22:20,121 --> 01:22:21,270
The flavor.
Remember in my,

1844
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:22,940
my,
uh,

1845
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:25,920
but was weird.
Mine that I can remember.

1846
01:22:25,921 --> 01:22:30,921
Shit.
I don't remember why I walked into a 

1847
01:22:30,921 --> 01:22:30,921
room like I like.
I'm like a savant.

1848
01:22:30,921 --> 01:22:31,440
What days are those?
Friday.

1849
01:22:31,441 --> 01:22:32,900
Saturday.
Okay.

1850
01:22:32,910 --> 01:22:35,830
It's not the 27th.
I was running savant.

1851
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:38,190
Savantas didn't kick in.
It could be the 20,

1852
01:22:38,191 --> 01:22:40,350
fourth and 25th.
Does that make sense?

1853
01:22:40,770 --> 01:22:43,890
It could be that what's the last week 
and enjoy the last weekend is that.

1854
01:22:43,891 --> 01:22:46,190
And there's a 31st in the first.
That would be it.

1855
01:22:46,191 --> 01:22:48,390
The 31st of the one before the one 
before it.

1856
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:49,980
Damn.
I'm not even gonna be around.

1857
01:22:49,981 --> 01:22:52,290
I'm going to be in Vegas.
I want to see that.

1858
01:22:52,330 --> 01:22:53,470
Where you go.
What are you going to come on?

1859
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,720
Go to UFC,
UFC gym.

1860
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:56,940
Doing Atlanta this week.

1861
01:22:56,940 --> 01:22:59,880
The improv.
Then hilarity in Cleveland.

1862
01:22:59,881 --> 01:23:01,320
You ever do hilarides?
No,

1863
01:23:01,321 --> 01:23:03,760
I have not.
I'm looking forward to the Improv.

1864
01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:04,980
I think I did.
Maybe I did.

1865
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:07,480
What other clubs are in Cleveland there?
An improv in Cleveland.

1866
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,550
Cleveland.
Think I did.

1867
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:12,790
That is one of the nicest clothes to 
river scene.

1868
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:15,670
It looks like a giant cruise ship.
It's got everything.

1869
01:23:15,671 --> 01:23:18,010
It's got to fucking Martini bar dancing 
girls.

1870
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:21,790
A sports bar theater.
I did a,

1871
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:24,520
one of the clubs in Cleveland,
I think it was the Improv.

1872
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:27,400
I did it with a half.
Ron and Charlie Murphy.

1873
01:23:27,810 --> 01:23:30,180
It's right next to a strip club.
I don't remember.

1874
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:33,100
Can I go by.
There were markings.

1875
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:38,500
My life.
We didn't have much time when we did 

1876
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:38,950
this tour.
I did this maxim comedy tour way back in

1877
01:23:38,951 --> 01:23:41,480
the day with Heffron and Charlie Murphy.
It was really fun at.

1878
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:43,570
John was feisty.
He liked to fight.

1879
01:23:43,710 --> 01:23:46,650
Did he never seemed like that with me 
with.

1880
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:48,410
We were always very friendly.
No,

1881
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,630
no,
not with me,

1882
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:51,210
but other people.
Yeah,

1883
01:23:51,211 --> 01:23:51,670
no,
no.

1884
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:53,590
I got along with him.
Great.

1885
01:23:53,591 --> 01:23:54,810
He's a great guy.
Yeah,

1886
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:56,500
but I mean,
we were out a couple times.

1887
01:23:56,501 --> 01:23:59,290
I think he stopped drinking,
but he wanted to fucking fight.

1888
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:01,480
That's crazy.
Oh yeah.

1889
01:24:01,481 --> 01:24:05,570
I was probably in the buffalo demon.

1890
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:08,710
Uh,
but we,

1891
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:10,690
uh,
we did that place and we did a different

1892
01:24:10,691 --> 01:24:12,730
place almost every night.
It was really crazy.

1893
01:24:12,731 --> 01:24:17,731
We were out for 20,
22 gigs after the exposure he got on the

1894
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:18,600
uh,
yes,

1895
01:24:18,850 --> 01:24:23,850
after he won half run,
one last comic standing and Charlie 

1896
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:24,820
Murphy had just done the Chappelle show.
Nice guy,

1897
01:24:25,410 --> 01:24:30,410
fucking sweetheart of a guy.
And as real as they come and a great 

1898
01:24:31,271 --> 01:24:32,140
storyteller,
man,

1899
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,180
Charlie Murphy kill you in the green 
room.

1900
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:37,540
He'll tell you some stories in the green
room and just kill you.

1901
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:40,290
He's a natural storyteller,
you know,

1902
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:45,300
it's a fun thing.
You get to bring people with the and 

1903
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:45,300
stuff.
That's cool.

1904
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:48,750
But that wasn't my idea.
That was something that maximum and bud 

1905
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:52,141
light put together.
We all just did it together and became 

1906
01:24:52,141 --> 01:24:52,141
friends.
Once we did,

1907
01:24:52,141 --> 01:24:56,131
I was just,
I didn't know either one of those guys 

1908
01:24:56,131 --> 01:24:56,131
before we did the tour.

1909
01:24:56,131 --> 01:24:59,220
So it was so lucky that they're both 
cool as fuck because how fraud is cool 

1910
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:02,641
as fuck.
And so is Charlie Murphy and that's how 

1911
01:25:02,641 --> 01:25:03,520
we met Tom Segura too.
We were at the,

1912
01:25:03,521 --> 01:25:04,230
um,
the,

1913
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:09,320
the celebrity theatre and Phoenix and 
Sigora was the opening act and look like

1914
01:25:10,091 --> 01:25:13,360
they would do maximum,
would hire like a local act,

1915
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:18,360
like a local pro and they would do like 
10 minutes or so before the,

1916
01:25:18,361 --> 01:25:23,361
uh,
the show would start with a half drawn 

1917
01:25:23,361 --> 01:25:24,840
and then he would either be me or 
Charlie Murphy and I'm the.

1918
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:26,770
Most of the guys were good.
They were all good.

1919
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:28,870
But one guy,
one guy was a deck,

1920
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:31,120
one crazy guy in Boston was a douche 
bag.

1921
01:25:31,570 --> 01:25:33,850
He was crazy drunk.
No his name.

1922
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:36,550
Every drunk.
Yes I do.

1923
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:41,730
Okay.
Well you said crazy and they all were 

1924
01:25:41,730 --> 01:25:43,450
pretty good but.
But Segura just really stood out.

1925
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:44,950
No kidding.
Oh yeah.

1926
01:25:44,951 --> 01:25:46,510
Yeah.
He went out there.

1927
01:25:46,590 --> 01:25:49,360
I mean the celebrity theater was a weird
place to because it was in the round.

1928
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:52,120
Those shows are odd if you've never done
that before.

1929
01:25:52,510 --> 01:25:56,500
And I've done it.
He went out there and just played it.

1930
01:25:57,190 --> 01:25:58,590
He did.
Yeah.

1931
01:25:59,930 --> 01:26:03,950
And I know he was a tough fucking huge.
He's a big fella.

1932
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,190
Not Anymore.
No.

1933
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,880
I mean,
I mean it was big.

1934
01:26:06,881 --> 01:26:08,780
Like he's a big man,
but not anymore.

1935
01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:10,170
No doubt.
Be Thin,

1936
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:12,520
but he was.
He was.

1937
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:14,900
He wasn't always fat,
but he was big though.

1938
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:17,770
He was when he would fight.
Oh fuck.

1939
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:22,780
Yeah.
And he might have a little bit of the 

1940
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:22,780
Yale and his sister before he slugged 
you.

1941
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:26,140
Those guys were animals.
Those guys like those cats.

1942
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:27,540
Dad,
Gavin's,

1943
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:33,550
nox and sox was a little bit later.
Kenny Rogers sin.

1944
01:26:34,130 --> 01:26:36,020
Those guys were savages.

1945
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:38,210
They don't get nearly the credit they 
deserve.

1946
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:43,420
There should've been a time capsule that
really captured that moment in common 

1947
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:45,020
and they did.
Didn't somebody do a movie about them?

1948
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:45,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

1949
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:49,580
France Palamida did pretty good was when
standups shit out.

1950
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:54,670
Very good actually mean for me.
I don't want to because it was so close 

1951
01:26:54,670 --> 01:26:56,170
to home.
I guess it was much more impact.

1952
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:58,970
I don't want to oversell it,
but I thought it was really fascinating.

1953
01:26:58,971 --> 01:27:00,830
If you're a fan of comedy,
I think it's brilliant.

1954
01:27:00,890 --> 01:27:04,750
I'll just never forget how they didn't 
bury me in Boston.

1955
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:05,780
Tried.
No,

1956
01:27:05,781 --> 01:27:06,440
no,
they did.

1957
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:11,470
They really like.
You could tell that they had an 

1958
01:27:11,470 --> 01:27:14,410
interesting relationship and Don Gavin 
gave me a great intro and nobody tried 

1959
01:27:14,410 --> 01:27:19,220
to.
They didn't want to burn if that's what 

1960
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:19,220
you mean.
Like they didn't think you were a dick.

1961
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:19,220
They all loved.
Yeah,

1962
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:19,460
that's good.

1963
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:20,220
To me.
They would.

1964
01:27:20,410 --> 01:27:22,340
They would think some guys were dicks 
though.

1965
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,040
Yeah.
And they were green light them.

1966
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:27,670
Oh yeah.
Because that was like a freight train of

1967
01:27:27,671 --> 01:27:32,671
comedy.
You couldn't fuck with that if they 

1968
01:27:32,671 --> 01:27:32,671
greenlit billy crystal.
They did that to Richard Lewis.

1969
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:36,250
Richard Lewis hid behind the stage for 
the audience left.

1970
01:27:36,270 --> 01:27:37,940
There was these guys,
man,

1971
01:27:37,941 --> 01:27:42,941
and he was one of them that uh,
for whatever reason they believe that 

1972
01:27:42,941 --> 01:27:43,400
generated.
Well.

1973
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:47,300
I'm a little bit of billy crystal,
but more Richard Lewis.

1974
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:50,330
They,
these guys generated a lot of hate.

1975
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:53,060
Yeah.
At a certain certain Comedians,

1976
01:27:53,061 --> 01:27:58,061
like certain community.
It's like we're like this guy just 

1977
01:27:58,061 --> 01:27:58,670
fucking funny.
He's not fucking funny.

1978
01:27:59,110 --> 01:28:01,970
You know,
I heard like club owners say that.

1979
01:28:01,971 --> 01:28:02,720
I was like,
why?

1980
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:07,750
Like obviously some people like them,
like he obviously has like an audience,

1981
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:11,090
right?
You gotta like it's from his movies more

1982
01:28:11,091 --> 01:28:11,840
than a stand up.

1983
01:28:11,890 --> 01:28:16,890
Oh,
I don't know about that with Richard 

1984
01:28:16,890 --> 01:28:16,890
Lewis Lewis.
No,

1985
01:28:16,890 --> 01:28:20,410
no.
I thought you were talking about billy 

1986
01:28:20,410 --> 01:28:20,410
crystal and Richard Lewis definitely 
stand up,

1987
01:28:20,410 --> 01:28:22,880
but for whatever reason,
there's certain people that will love to

1988
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:27,881
hate that guy or disrespect is comedy.
It's like everybody's got different 

1989
01:28:28,221 --> 01:28:32,540
tastes and that's so hard for some 
people who are fans of standup comedy to

1990
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:34,540
realize that's why there's no best 
standup,

1991
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:36,430
but not always.
They know best standup.

1992
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:39,320
You're crazy to look for it,
like don't even look for it.

1993
01:28:39,450 --> 01:28:43,460
It's just just just enjoy what you enjoy
because it's subjective.

1994
01:28:43,461 --> 01:28:48,461
It's not objective.
Like if there's the 100 yard dash guy 

1995
01:28:48,461 --> 01:28:50,290
because the fastest guy wins.
You can't argue that.

1996
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:55,330
I think that their guy was fast and 
there's some guys that all they want to 

1997
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:59,741
see Gaffigan say anything African says.
There's some guys and gals that Gaffigan

1998
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:06,200
fucking for whatever it is,
he hits their frequency and for other 

1999
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:06,690
folks it's a towel,
you know,

2000
01:29:06,691 --> 01:29:10,690
and whatever it is it is,
and you can't get upset that some guys I

2001
01:29:10,691 --> 01:29:12,690
could tell like I don't even see it.

2002
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:15,300
I didn't see it relaxed.
Don't concentrate on that.

2003
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:16,190
I know.
You know,

2004
01:29:16,191 --> 01:29:18,450
you just relax.
Don't get angry.

2005
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,480
People love telling me that thing cooks 
not funny.

2006
01:29:21,870 --> 01:29:22,860
It was like,
okay,

2007
01:29:22,861 --> 01:29:24,540
relax.
It's like you.

2008
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:29,570
You don't have to think he's funny.
Apparently he made millions of dollars 

2009
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:32,721
because somebody thought he was funny,
so I get too much pleasure at other 

2010
01:29:32,721 --> 01:29:34,320
people.
Sucking that is a problem.

2011
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:39,380
That's a weird thing with people.
They get this weird pleasure out of 

2012
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:41,880
other people sucking.
I don't know what it is.

2013
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:43,980
It's interesting though.
It's a,

2014
01:29:43,990 --> 01:29:47,190
it's a weird little side effect,
a little heater side effect.

2015
01:29:47,191 --> 01:29:49,530
It's jealousy.
It's a combination of a lot of things,

2016
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:54,560
but it's so bad for the person who 
thinks that that's what they don't 

2017
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:55,050
understand.
Like it's just a massive distraction,

2018
01:29:55,530 --> 01:30:00,530
you know?
So it just takes away so much energy 

2019
01:30:00,530 --> 01:30:02,280
from your own life because instead of 
concentrating on this other person,

2020
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:05,190
you should be concentrating on your own 
shit and if something bothers you,

2021
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:08,940
you should find a way,
if at all possible.

2022
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:12,210
And that's of course it's some egregious
offense or a crime or some,

2023
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:17,270
some sort of sin against man and nature.
Find some way to turn it into a 

2024
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:22,041
motivating factor for you.
If you feel weak because you see some 

2025
01:30:22,041 --> 01:30:23,420
guy like you know,
I dunno,

2026
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:28,520
name your fucking book Mogul Bill Gates 
on TV and he's got a billion dollars in 

2027
01:30:28,591 --> 01:30:29,650
his underwear.
You know,

2028
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:33,300
and you feel like you can't even fucking
pay my student loans are figuring out,

2029
01:30:33,301 --> 01:30:37,080
figure out what,
what the fuck you need to do so that you

2030
01:30:37,081 --> 01:30:39,660
become so successful.
You don't worry about Bill Gates anymore

2031
01:30:39,730 --> 01:30:41,370
if you don't have to be as successful of
a bill gates,

2032
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:46,640
but become enough of a person who 
figures your way through the net of 

2033
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:51,321
civilization to the point where you 
don't have to worry when maybe for 

2034
01:30:51,321 --> 01:30:55,281
everybody has their own gradient.
For some people it might be just making 

2035
01:30:55,281 --> 01:30:55,670
a living is good enough,
you know,

2036
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:57,960
for some people it has nothing to do 
with how much money they make.

2037
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:00,360
It has to do with getting their fucking 
mind right.

2038
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:03,270
You know,
go into either go into a shrink or doing

2039
01:31:03,271 --> 01:31:08,130
some yoga or going on a mushroom trip,
figure out whatever the fuck you need to

2040
01:31:08,131 --> 01:31:13,131
do to get your mind right because it 
doesn't matter how much money you make 

2041
01:31:13,131 --> 01:31:13,740
or it doesn't matter anything that else 
is going on in your life.

2042
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:16,890
If you don't have your mind right.
If you're not thinking about life,

2043
01:31:16,891 --> 01:31:18,420
clearly you're gonna,
you're gonna.

2044
01:31:18,450 --> 01:31:20,220
Make some Shitty,
stupid decisions.

2045
01:31:20,221 --> 01:31:20,870
So you're gonna,
you're gonna.

2046
01:31:20,890 --> 01:31:22,740
Be annoying to almost everybody around 
you.

2047
01:31:23,190 --> 01:31:25,290
You're going to fuck things up left and 
right.

2048
01:31:26,010 --> 01:31:27,060
Get it together,
bitch.

2049
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,110
Hey talking to me.
Not that you don't know,

2050
01:31:30,150 --> 01:31:35,150
you know,
never are you a so you're going to this 

2051
01:31:35,150 --> 01:31:35,490
defined sasquatch going to find.
So we talk about that.

2052
01:31:35,491 --> 01:31:38,130
Yes we are.
We can can't talk too much because it is

2053
01:31:38,131 --> 01:31:41,070
top secret,
but for my new Saifai show,

2054
01:31:41,850 --> 01:31:46,850
very soon in the near future,
I'm going to go searching for sasquatch 

2055
01:31:46,850 --> 01:31:51,021
and very peculiar and particular 
location that has been known for a high 

2056
01:31:51,021 --> 01:31:52,070
volume of sasquatch sightings era.

2057
01:31:52,290 --> 01:31:56,670
Was there a particular forest that he 
frequents perhaps is the same?

2058
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:59,320
I can't say whether I've said too much 
already,

2059
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:04,620
but we will be camping and will be.
We will be getting our freak out in the 

2060
01:32:05,171 --> 01:32:10,171
woods.
I don't think I'd want to go camp and 

2061
01:32:10,171 --> 01:32:10,171
Joe.
Yeah,

2062
01:32:10,171 --> 01:32:11,230
maybe not.
I'll tell you when I get back whether or

2063
01:32:11,231 --> 01:32:16,231
not it was worth it.
What didn't you go somewhere with 

2064
01:32:16,231 --> 01:32:16,231
Carolyn?
Yeah.

2065
01:32:16,231 --> 01:32:17,550
We went hunting in Montana.
Notice I said hunting with no gi.

2066
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:20,650
That's because I'm a hunter.
I say it so often.

2067
01:32:20,651 --> 01:32:25,651
It just flows off the tongue.
He lived by my railroad.

2068
01:32:26,650 --> 01:32:29,430
I make my own eyebrows.
Oh,

2069
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:32,490
that was a.
Did you ever see that Bo Jackson Jackson

2070
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:33,850
thing,
but he makes his own arrows.

2071
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:34,780
Oh,
does he really?

2072
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:35,950
Yeah,
he's fucking crazy.

2073
01:32:36,010 --> 01:32:38,110
He's like a mad man.
Hunter and fisherman,

2074
01:32:38,111 --> 01:32:38,440
right?
Yeah,

2075
01:32:38,450 --> 01:32:39,240
yeah.
Yeah.

2076
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:44,580
He's a real outdoors calibrator and he's
sitting there and that's his favorite 

2077
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:45,130
thing in the world.

2078
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,680
Well,
it's very fun.

2079
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:52,800
You know,
the people don't want to hear that 

2080
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:52,800
because they don't want you going out 
there killing animals.

2081
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:53,140
They take call.
Wow.

2082
01:32:53,141 --> 01:32:55,660
You can't say it's fun.
You say that you call that fun man.

2083
01:32:56,020 --> 01:33:01,020
What's rewarding and beautiful and it 
connects you to nature and it's very 

2084
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:02,500
humbling and it's also,
you know,

2085
01:33:02,501 --> 01:33:05,800
it's a really intense thing like making 
your own,

2086
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,720
getting your own food,
you know,

2087
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:10,450
going out and hunting your own food is 
very intense.

2088
01:33:10,451 --> 01:33:15,451
I don't,
I don't think everybody should have to 

2089
01:33:15,451 --> 01:33:15,451
do it,
but for me it was a,

2090
01:33:15,451 --> 01:33:19,150
it was pretty intense.
I like five star restaurants,

2091
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:23,050
like being upgraded me to these.
All these things are good as well.

2092
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:24,130
Yeah.
I just,

2093
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,920
I'm too lazy.
I don't want to like pick up a tent.

2094
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:29,080
I feel you.
I feel you bro.

2095
01:33:29,170 --> 01:33:32,260
I'm not into it all the time,
but say you like it,

2096
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:33,310
but I don't like it.

2097
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,430
No,
you just do it.

2098
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:39,620
Just I just because I don't like,
it doesn't mean that you went to one 

2099
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:39,930
with Brian.
He must've liked it.

2100
01:33:40,010 --> 01:33:45,010
It was cold as fuck.
We're camping out in the middle of the 

2101
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:45,820
snow in Montana in the middle of 
freezing weather.

2102
01:33:45,821 --> 01:33:47,500
It didn't snow.
It did rain one day though.

2103
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:51,160
You know,
it's miserable.

2104
01:33:51,550 --> 01:33:53,560
But uh,
I wanted to experience it,

2105
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:54,760
you know,
I thought it'd be,

2106
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I think we're so far removed from being 
in the wilderness that to have an 

2107
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,771
opportunity,
especially with like expert outdoorsman 

2108
01:34:04,771 --> 01:34:05,080
to go out into the wilderness for five 
days and be like,

2109
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:06,190
I'm going,
you know,

2110
01:34:06,210 --> 01:34:10,750
this is going to be wildness.
Ari Shaffir Niagen and salmon fishing.

2111
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:13,500
We're headed up to the great white north
of Alaska.

2112
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:15,730
Was trying to get a date in anchorage.
Yeah.

2113
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:18,250
To go salmon fishing.
You get a date in Anchorage?

2114
01:34:18,430 --> 01:34:19,810
Yeah.
We're gonna go,

2115
01:34:19,811 --> 01:34:21,490
uh,
hopefully,

2116
01:34:21,491 --> 01:34:22,690
uh,
go catch them.

2117
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:27,780
Fucking salmon time.
I pull those women's sector giant 

2118
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:30,100
monsters.
Crazy fucking fish.

2119
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,070
Fish.
She doesn't have a quickie or,

2120
01:34:33,450 --> 01:34:38,450
and how hard it must've been to eat fish
back before people figured out rods and 

2121
01:34:38,450 --> 01:34:41,020
reels and spears.
Chili fucking hard to get a fish meal.

2122
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,600
What do you get a deal?
You gotta grab it with your hand.

2123
01:34:44,601 --> 01:34:45,340
Stupid.
Well,

2124
01:34:45,341 --> 01:34:47,310
the idea,
the them swimming upstream,

2125
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:49,780
there was so many of them.
You could like bad amount of the air.

2126
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:53,020
So ridiculous that that was the choice 
for survival,

2127
01:34:53,050 --> 01:34:58,050
that they would go all the way upstream 
back to the river or back up the mouth 

2128
01:34:58,050 --> 01:34:58,850
of the river at the brightest fish.
Well,

2129
01:34:58,851 --> 01:35:03,851
that's nuts that they live in fresh 
water and and they also live in 

2130
01:35:03,851 --> 01:35:05,060
saltwater.
What a crazy animal.

2131
01:35:05,061 --> 01:35:07,610
Brackish water.
Wild fucking animal.

2132
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:11,540
Is that a real thing that's been going 
around this thing with human like teeth?

2133
01:35:11,870 --> 01:35:15,920
It's called a sheep shed sheet.
She said fish.

2134
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:17,330
Sheep said fish.
Yeah.

2135
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:20,030
It's all over the Internet.
Yeah.

2136
01:35:20,031 --> 01:35:21,650
Fisher.
Weird band.

2137
01:35:21,790 --> 01:35:23,990
They're out.
They're pretty thin water and shit.

2138
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:29,020
Swimming around.
I watched the show today about a 

2139
01:35:29,020 --> 01:35:29,150
paddlefish.
Paddlefish is.

2140
01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:34,570
It doesn't have any bones.
Some weird prehistoric fish that lives 

2141
01:35:34,731 --> 01:35:39,731
in.
I think there was the ozarks or 

2142
01:35:39,731 --> 01:35:41,651
something like that.
I forget what they were saying that you 

2143
01:35:41,651 --> 01:35:44,471
can't even catch them with like bait.
The way you catch them is by having a 

2144
01:35:44,471 --> 01:35:48,551
line with a bunch of hooks on it and you
just drop it down and keep pulling it 

2145
01:35:48,551 --> 01:35:48,950
up,
but keep pulling up,

2146
01:35:48,951 --> 01:35:53,951
trying to snag something and that's it.
If you snag it and if you snag it then 

2147
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:59,291
you just pull it up to the surface but 
you never like legitimately catch 

2148
01:35:59,291 --> 01:36:00,210
whenever you just got to snag one.
I never heard.

2149
01:36:00,210 --> 01:36:02,240
It's still a way to catch them.
Yeah,

2150
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:05,870
they're enormous and they have no bones.
They're so weird.

2151
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:10,610
There are some sort of weird prehistoric
fish and the way they got them,

2152
01:36:10,611 --> 01:36:13,160
it's so strange.
They make an incision and then they pull

2153
01:36:13,161 --> 01:36:14,930
out the spinal cord.
They eat them.

2154
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:16,220
Yeah.
They eat everything.

2155
01:36:16,221 --> 01:36:21,221
They in this row of of these animals is 
apparently very much likes sturgeon row,

2156
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:29,530
which is what caviar is,
which is worth a lot of money and so in 

2157
01:36:29,530 --> 01:36:33,761
order to make sure that they didn't 
allow a market for this stuff to 

2158
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:39,371
develop,
even though it's legal to kill the 

2159
01:36:39,371 --> 01:36:41,741
animal and legal to eat the animal,
it's only legal to possess it's row on 

2160
01:36:42,051 --> 01:36:47,051
the dock.
You could only either have it on your 

2161
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:49,751
boat or on the dock,
so you got to either eat that row or 

2162
01:36:49,751 --> 01:36:52,781
throw it out because you can't take it 
with you because you can develop a 

2163
01:36:52,781 --> 01:36:52,781
market for it.

2164
01:36:52,781 --> 01:36:57,070
You can't develop a market for it 
because then the animals road would be 

2165
01:36:57,070 --> 01:36:58,380
worth too much and they would worry that
even though you,

2166
01:36:58,381 --> 01:37:03,381
you know,
you have a certain number that you can 

2167
01:37:03,381 --> 01:37:03,381
kill and a day and eat.
Like they say it tastes good.

2168
01:37:03,381 --> 01:37:05,180
They say it tastes like pork as they're 
saying.

2169
01:37:05,181 --> 01:37:06,500
When they.
They grilled it,

2170
01:37:06,501 --> 01:37:11,501
they said it because like a lot of 
people have an aversion to eating it 

2171
01:37:11,501 --> 01:37:11,501
because it's a strange.
Like.

2172
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:16,540
It's almost like they have prejudices 
against it because it doesn't have any 

2173
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:18,560
bones and it looks like it's a fucking 
billion years old.

2174
01:37:18,561 --> 01:37:20,420
It looks like a crazy dime.
Swordfish.

2175
01:37:20,450 --> 01:37:22,980
It's missing the keep discovering new 
species.

2176
01:37:23,050 --> 01:37:28,050
The.
Have you ever heard of the snakehead 

2177
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:28,050
fish?
Yeah.

2178
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:28,640
Those are a real problem.
They have snakehead fishes in fishes.

2179
01:37:28,710 --> 01:37:32,700
Is central snakehead fish have been 
spotted in central park central park.

2180
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:34,160
Yeah.
Thanks for finishing my sentence.

2181
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:39,670
Yeah.
This they've invaded in central park at 

2182
01:37:39,670 --> 01:37:39,670
a fuck.
They get there.

2183
01:37:39,670 --> 01:37:39,710
Somebody had to bring them.
Yeah.

2184
01:37:39,711 --> 01:37:41,950
That's what,
that's what's going on in have water for

2185
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:43,660
a couple of days.
Which is the scary part.

2186
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:46,290
They walk.
Do they walk the walk?

2187
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:52,300
Did you ever see that?
A special about the Congo where I think 

2188
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:53,720
that's where they live.
I think where they live isn't the Congo.

2189
01:37:54,050 --> 01:37:59,050
Um,
it's the then into Asia and Russia is 

2190
01:37:59,050 --> 01:37:59,050
what this says.
Is that what it is?

2191
01:37:59,050 --> 01:38:00,780
What this article says?
They're probably right.

2192
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:01,800
I mean,
I'm sure I'm wrong,

2193
01:38:01,801 --> 01:38:04,580
but there's a fish like it.
It might not be the snakehead,

2194
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:06,330
but this is.
There's a video.

2195
01:38:06,510 --> 01:38:08,220
Let me see if I can pull it up on 
youtube.

2196
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:11,330
It's a BBC Congo,
and uh,

2197
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:15,900
I've talked about it before.
It's really a damn shame that this video

2198
01:38:15,901 --> 01:38:17,530
isn't like one of those,
um,

2199
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:22,500
you know,
those mother earth or a planet earth DVD

2200
01:38:22,690 --> 01:38:27,690
setups,
whether they're super easy to get 

2201
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:27,690
everybody knows about them.

2202
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:27,690
Right?
That's like,

2203
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:29,910
if you want to see some cool shit on 
nature of the planet Earth series is,

2204
01:38:29,911 --> 01:38:31,620
is amazing.
Well,

2205
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:36,700
the BBC One,
the Congo one really should be just as 

2206
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:39,150
fascinating to people.
It's really sad that a,

2207
01:38:39,210 --> 01:38:42,390
that for whatever reason that that video
is hard to get ahold of.

2208
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:48,260
But in one of the scenes there's this 
weird fish probably similar to snake 

2209
01:38:48,311 --> 01:38:53,311
head gets out of water and start to walk
in and you're like,

2210
01:38:53,371 --> 01:38:56,800
I can't believe this.
It's his walks over to another puddle.

2211
01:38:56,830 --> 01:39:01,830
Then jumps in you like,
you literally can't believe what I'm 

2212
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:04,341
seeing it.
Like this is a dinosaur is fucking 

2213
01:39:04,341 --> 01:39:04,341
thing.
Just did some dinosaur shit.

2214
01:39:04,341 --> 01:39:04,680
Wow.
I mean,

2215
01:39:04,681 --> 01:39:07,910
we're literally seeing life evolve.
That's what I mean.

2216
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:09,780
That's like the beginning of that,
right?

2217
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:13,890
The ability to come out of the water and
walk on the ground to better water.

2218
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:17,150
Holy Shit.
What a freak.

2219
01:39:17,151 --> 01:39:19,910
You fucking snake fish thing,
whatever it is.

2220
01:39:19,911 --> 01:39:21,790
And they call it a snake fish.
Oh No.

2221
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:25,210
I wonder what it's called in the Congo 
snake.

2222
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:29,520
Snakehead fish.
Um,

2223
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:34,780
the Congo is apparently like one of the 
densest,

2224
01:39:35,430 --> 01:39:37,630
densest rain forests in the world.

2225
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:40,460
Yeah.
I don't know what the fuck that,

2226
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:43,490
that fish.
It's called naked something else.

2227
01:39:44,810 --> 01:39:47,030
But um,
if you get a chance to get ahold of that

2228
01:39:47,031 --> 01:39:49,640
documentary,
I think it's just called BBC Congo.

2229
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:53,930
Let me Google it real quick.
I think that's what it was called.

2230
01:39:54,140 --> 01:39:56,390
There's something coming up for mystery 
fish of the Congo,

2231
01:39:56,391 --> 01:39:58,370
but the video won't play.
Well,

2232
01:39:58,371 --> 01:40:01,850
there is also those ones that you've 
already watched a show.

2233
01:40:01,851 --> 01:40:03,470
Um,
river monsters.

2234
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:05,660
Yeah.
That guy is bad ass.

2235
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,650
He's a fishing motherfucker.
That guy went out in the wooden canal.

2236
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:11,690
I used to think nothing of that show.
I say,

2237
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:12,770
Oh,
there's the guy fishing.

2238
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,810
What's the big deal?
No,

2239
01:40:15,020 --> 01:40:19,610
this guy finishes how the locals fish.
He got an this wooden boat.

2240
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:23,480
Okay.
With like a hundred hooks in it and they

2241
01:40:23,481 --> 01:40:25,410
were in this like tipity top one,
but,

2242
01:40:25,450 --> 01:40:28,940
and they're dropping these lines in for 
giant catfish.

2243
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:34,180
So at any point in time something could 
fucking grabbed one of those lines and 

2244
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:38,020
hold those,
those fishing lines and who knows how 

2245
01:40:38,020 --> 01:40:38,210
many hooks are flying in that guy's 
direction.

2246
01:40:38,211 --> 01:40:43,211
And actually people have died from that.
Like one of the people in this tribe 

2247
01:40:43,211 --> 01:40:46,750
died from that.
He got caught on a hook and dragged 

2248
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:46,750
underwater.
Like that guy is legit.

2249
01:40:46,850 --> 01:40:49,280
And this is the other thing that he said
while he was there,

2250
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:50,380
there,
um,

2251
01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:54,820
one of the people are the main people in
their tribe that chief disappeared.

2252
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:00,000
He was gone for a whole day and they 
were seriously worried and because they 

2253
01:41:00,521 --> 01:41:05,521
believe in bad spirits and bad omens,
they believe that he had caused the 

2254
01:41:06,761 --> 01:41:09,670
chief to disappear.
And if the chief didn't come back,

2255
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:13,330
they were planning on killing him.
They were going to stone him to death.

2256
01:41:13,850 --> 01:41:17,380
But thankfully the chief came back and 
everybody was elated because like,

2257
01:41:17,650 --> 01:41:20,020
but he was like,
you don't understand how close I came to

2258
01:41:20,021 --> 01:41:25,021
dying.
Like they would have tried to kill him 

2259
01:41:25,021 --> 01:41:25,360
because they felt like he was a bad omen
and he created,

2260
01:41:25,361 --> 01:41:27,820
even if you didn't actively do anything 
to the chief,

2261
01:41:28,090 --> 01:41:33,090
he created the bad luck that made the 
chief disappear is fucking canoe,

2262
01:41:33,850 --> 01:41:36,110
motherfucker.
What's that joke?

2263
01:41:36,230 --> 01:41:39,370
It was a stupid joke.
But a guy,

2264
01:41:39,430 --> 01:41:43,060
uh,
is captured by these savages and they're

2265
01:41:43,061 --> 01:41:44,330
going to eat him.
Right?

2266
01:41:44,530 --> 01:41:47,020
And he said that,
I'm going to butcher the joke,

2267
01:41:47,050 --> 01:41:49,240
but I just loved the punchline.
And he goes,

2268
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:50,680
well,
what are you going to do with your skin?

2269
01:41:51,430 --> 01:41:53,140
They go,
we're going to make a cannula out of it.

2270
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:54,580
And it grabs a knife.
He goes,

2271
01:41:54,581 --> 01:41:55,900
yeah,
you're fucking canoe.

2272
01:42:00,660 --> 01:42:04,570
That's harsh joke.
That's a tough joke.

2273
01:42:04,630 --> 01:42:07,580
That's a tough job.
A from a tough neighborhood.

2274
01:42:07,581 --> 01:42:09,160
Joe,
Philadelphia,

2275
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:11,020
Pennsylvania.
It's a non factor.

2276
01:42:11,030 --> 01:42:16,030
Did 90 percent of all queries come from 
your town to have the best one is only 

2277
01:42:19,911 --> 01:42:24,911
two types of things and come from 
Oklahoma steers and queers.

2278
01:42:25,670 --> 01:42:28,790
Somebody was the first guy to say that,
believe it's some mothers anymore.

2279
01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:31,800
Guys still live there?
Yeah.

2280
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:33,360
Still live.
There ain't no.

2281
01:42:34,550 --> 01:42:37,400
Well you can't.
You can't call him fag and no more.

2282
01:42:37,401 --> 01:42:38,990
What else?
Thought and revolution.

2283
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:43,030
Queer seems to roll off the tongue 
easier.

2284
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:46,460
He's sending like the main Larry the 
cable guy to the meeting.

2285
01:42:46,470 --> 01:42:51,470
Larry the cable guy.
Larry tights am telling you to suck my 

2286
01:42:56,331 --> 01:42:57,200
dick real quick.

2287
01:42:58,040 --> 01:43:01,550
Here's how bad my taste is.
There's a better manager or agent.

2288
01:43:01,551 --> 01:43:04,950
I would be Dan witness's name,
right?

2289
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:06,920
Great Guy.

2290
01:43:07,770 --> 01:43:08,790
Yeah,
he's a great guy.

2291
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:14,480
I've met homeboy.
I was trying to talk him out of the 

2292
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,360
Larry the cable guy was that was 
basically trying to talk about it,

2293
01:43:16,361 --> 01:43:19,910
but the life of a billion dollars.
I sit down.

2294
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:22,290
I love this character is strong,
but you know,

2295
01:43:22,820 --> 01:43:25,470
you're like your old character better.
Uh,

2296
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:28,870
I dunno diamonds still pretty well,
but it'd be you fucking wrong.

2297
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:34,900
Will you fucking wrong.
You have to say it twice for rarer bad 

2298
01:43:35,731 --> 01:43:38,460
advice.
Stama river coming down on me.

2299
01:43:38,461 --> 01:43:40,820
Joe.
He the wolf has then a guy.

2300
01:43:40,890 --> 01:43:43,800
Has a guy ever become like really good 
that you didn't see coming.

2301
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:48,880
We saw them in the beginning and Whoa,
this guy's fucked because we know.

2302
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:50,880
I'll tell you who these killing really 
good.

2303
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:52,030
That was that I

2304
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:54,890
was more surprised because he was so 
shy.

2305
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:57,530
And Brian Reagan.
Oh,

2306
01:43:57,650 --> 01:43:59,190
Brian Regan's.
Every fund.

2307
01:43:59,191 --> 01:44:00,110
Yeah,
but see Brian,

2308
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:04,040
I knew him since the beginning.
He was like 19 year old kid,

2309
01:44:04,070 --> 01:44:09,070
20 year old.
That was an MC and he was just gracious 

2310
01:44:09,070 --> 01:44:11,580
and deferring and not silly at all.
It was like a steam.

2311
01:44:11,581 --> 01:44:13,760
It's like a classic,
like tonight show stand up.

2312
01:44:14,270 --> 01:44:14,960
But none of the,
you know,

2313
01:44:14,980 --> 01:44:15,630
the,
the,

2314
01:44:15,700 --> 01:44:18,500
the ghoulies like all over the place and
the character,

2315
01:44:18,860 --> 01:44:20,760
you know,
he's fucking brilliantly funny.

2316
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:24,390
He just knows how to be funny.
It's his style to his,

2317
01:44:24,391 --> 01:44:26,760
like his style of being funny.
So he's got his own.

2318
01:44:27,550 --> 01:44:28,710
Brian Regan.
Yeah.

2319
01:44:28,711 --> 01:44:30,960
He's like one of the,
just like a few guys,

2320
01:44:30,961 --> 01:44:35,280
like maybe three or four guys that are 
like squeaky clean,

2321
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:38,820
but that everybody agrees are awesome.
It used to be Hedberg,

2322
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:40,830
Hedberg dot.
Everybody loved Hedberg.

2323
01:44:40,831 --> 01:44:43,590
But what people forget is if Hedberg was
squeaky clean.

2324
01:44:44,190 --> 01:44:45,070
Really?
Really?

2325
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:46,140
I loved that.
Brilliant.

2326
01:44:46,170 --> 01:44:51,170
It was brilliant.
He was a really an all time great for 

2327
01:44:51,170 --> 01:44:54,711
me.
He's one of the few guys that I was to 

2328
01:44:54,711 --> 01:44:54,711
this day.
I'm like,

2329
01:44:54,711 --> 01:44:58,521
listen to his old stuff just to laugh if
I'm at the airport or something like 

2330
01:44:58,521 --> 01:44:58,521
that.
I still love him.

2331
01:44:58,521 --> 01:45:00,270
He was on.
Remember full frontal comedy.

2332
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:01,260
Yeah,
yeah,

2333
01:45:01,261 --> 01:45:01,950
yeah,
yeah.

2334
01:45:02,670 --> 01:45:05,210
And the Hedberg was on.
I remember one line he said,

2335
01:45:05,211 --> 01:45:06,560
uh,
uh,

2336
01:45:06,561 --> 01:45:09,620
no matter how much I practice tennis,
I'll never be as good as the wall.

2337
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:17,140
The Wall is relentless.
Like he took like an old expression and 

2338
01:45:18,711 --> 01:45:22,310
made it a really funny bit playing 
tennis ball against the wall.

2339
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:25,580
Like this fucking guy's playing tennis 
ball against the wall.

2340
01:45:25,581 --> 01:45:30,581
You never go.
When he told me he turns it into like 

2341
01:45:30,581 --> 01:45:30,830
one of the best bits ever.
Fucking brilliant.

2342
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:32,900
I was just in his home.
I go,

2343
01:45:32,901 --> 01:45:33,950
well,
one of his towns,

2344
01:45:33,951 --> 01:45:37,340
Austin box gone.
He's from Minneapolis listening,

2345
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:41,540
but he did a lot of comedy in Texas,
but I met him in Houston,

2346
01:45:42,170 --> 01:45:44,270
but they really are big fans of his down
there.

2347
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:46,550
Yeah,
he was awesome,

2348
01:45:46,551 --> 01:45:48,140
man.
He was beautiful.

2349
01:45:48,540 --> 01:45:50,440
It was really great and finding great 
standup.

2350
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:53,820
It was really fucking funny.
What time have you offered me coke at?

2351
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:55,040
At,
at a,

2352
01:45:55,110 --> 01:45:58,280
a party in Montreal and he's such a nice
kid,

2353
01:45:58,281 --> 01:45:59,660
you know,
I go and I said,

2354
01:46:00,050 --> 01:46:01,460
I don't do coke.
He goes,

2355
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:02,660
I'm sorry.
I know.

2356
01:46:02,661 --> 01:46:04,550
Sorry.
Fucking generous.

2357
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,670
It's basically go up for me a $200 
sweater.

2358
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:08,930
No,
it's nice.

2359
01:46:08,940 --> 01:46:09,920
It's.
Janice just said,

2360
01:46:09,921 --> 01:46:11,350
I don't happen to do it.
I'm not.

2361
01:46:11,351 --> 01:46:14,180
I'm not judging it.
He came up to me in Rochester,

2362
01:46:14,181 --> 01:46:18,920
New York we met for and he was so proud 
that he was only drinking beer.

2363
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:20,780
You know,
he wasn't doing drugs.

2364
01:46:21,270 --> 01:46:21,790
He said,
no.

2365
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,660
I said,
so basically you're bragging to me about

2366
01:46:23,661 --> 01:46:28,661
only being an alcoholic kind of.
There is such a giant difference between

2367
01:46:30,660 --> 01:46:34,660
those drugs and all the other ones.
The opiates and those are the.

2368
01:46:35,310 --> 01:46:40,310
I saw a commercial the other day for a 
some sort of clinic for opiate 

2369
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:40,770
addiction.
Just talking about,

2370
01:46:41,030 --> 01:46:43,290
you know,
how easy it is to get hooked and all the

2371
01:46:43,291 --> 01:46:48,291
different people that are hooked and 
don't want to admit they're hooked and 

2372
01:46:48,291 --> 01:46:51,120
they're showing you the examples of I 
would like to it I'm serious.

2373
01:46:51,721 --> 01:46:54,660
I would love to do if there was,
you know,

2374
01:46:54,930 --> 01:46:57,300
I mean if there was,
it was so dangerous,

2375
01:46:57,780 --> 01:47:00,090
but I love the feeling because I don't 
want fucking.

2376
01:47:00,570 --> 01:47:05,570
I don't want to be high.
Like I don't want to be like meth or 

2377
01:47:05,570 --> 01:47:05,580
anything.
Speedy cocaine.

2378
01:47:05,581 --> 01:47:06,540
Yeah.
That's scary.

2379
01:47:06,541 --> 01:47:09,390
You already know.
I don't even drink too much coffee,

2380
01:47:09,930 --> 01:47:11,760
but fucking mellows.
I like,

2381
01:47:11,761 --> 01:47:14,760
I like to be nodding off,
throwing up.

2382
01:47:15,950 --> 01:47:19,580
It was a sense of music all of a sudden 
I think already I saw.

2383
01:47:20,610 --> 01:47:22,340
Yeah.
You get to the root of things.

2384
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:26,170
What do you like to try heroin now?
When you like to know what the feelings.

2385
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:29,130
Like I don't trust myself.
I don't trust that I wouldn't like it.

2386
01:47:29,370 --> 01:47:30,770
Yeah.
I don't trust.

2387
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:34,290
I don't trust anything.
This is my rule and I don't tell anybody

2388
01:47:34,291 --> 01:47:36,510
what to do ever,
but that's not true.

2389
01:47:36,630 --> 01:47:37,350
Why am I lying?

2390
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:41,810
I'll tell you,
don't do it.

2391
01:47:42,230 --> 01:47:47,230
Um,
I don't fuck with anything that's 

2392
01:47:47,230 --> 01:47:49,281
addictive.
I don't fuck with anything that can get 

2393
01:47:49,281 --> 01:47:52,071
you.
You don't even like coffee because 

2394
01:47:52,071 --> 01:47:52,071
coffee can get,
you know,

2395
01:47:52,090 --> 01:47:55,080
I take weeks off upon all the time.
Yeah,

2396
01:47:55,140 --> 01:47:55,710
yeah,
yeah.

2397
01:47:55,711 --> 01:47:59,130
All the time that's fucked up.
The only time I.

2398
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:02,970
I'm absolutely smoked pot.
He used to be before Jujitsu,

2399
01:48:03,010 --> 01:48:08,010
but before isolation tank,
I'm almost always do it before that or 

2400
01:48:08,010 --> 01:48:10,050
before writing a lot of time to do it.
Before writing.

2401
01:48:10,410 --> 01:48:11,430
It helps you.
Well,

2402
01:48:11,580 --> 01:48:12,500
yeah.
I like to.

2403
01:48:12,870 --> 01:48:17,870
It gets me into a nice groove.
It helps me release my current grasp on 

2404
01:48:19,951 --> 01:48:23,670
reality.
I just think when you get an opportunity

2405
01:48:23,671 --> 01:48:26,130
to look at things from like coffee 
doesn't do that.

2406
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:30,950
Coffee sort of inspires movement 
inspires me to act to me,

2407
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:35,960
to have energy to start things off.
But for me the best inspiration is like 

2408
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:40,700
a mental inspiration because inspiration
where I could step away from it all and 

2409
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:40,700
see it from a different perspective.

2410
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:45,740
So that's what a lot of times we're 
getting high does for me allows me to 

2411
01:48:45,740 --> 01:48:46,440
just like move over to the next window.
You know,

2412
01:48:46,490 --> 01:48:50,550
I've been looking at things through the 
window of sober sustained reality.

2413
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:52,710
Let's move over and look at things from 
the.

2414
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:55,830
Oh look it over here,
but if you're kinda high and you relax a

2415
01:48:55,831 --> 01:48:58,000
little bit,
you realize this is kind of funny.

2416
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:01,350
Really.
And then he start poking holes in things

2417
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:03,840
instead of.
I don't get funnier at all with alcohol.

2418
01:49:03,841 --> 01:49:05,490
I,
that's the only thing I ever do,

2419
01:49:05,970 --> 01:49:10,560
but it's one Martini will get me funny.
Yeah.

2420
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:12,810
Two martinis.
Not so funny.

2421
01:49:13,890 --> 01:49:15,940
It's really a big difference.
I mean it's really a bit.

2422
01:49:15,980 --> 01:49:20,980
It really,
it just slows me down enough where I 

2423
01:49:20,980 --> 01:49:21,460
don't feel that fucking,
you know.

2424
01:49:21,461 --> 01:49:23,230
And keep bottom.
Oh yeah.

2425
01:49:24,070 --> 01:49:26,820
Well I can do one is,
yeah,

2426
01:49:26,821 --> 01:49:29,950
like a little bit of a buzz,
like a tiny little bit of a buzz.

2427
01:49:29,951 --> 01:49:32,670
It's kind of Nice to nervous.
You get nervous at all?

2428
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:36,420
No,
I get the only time I get anxious at all

2429
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:38,160
is if someone I know is going to be 
there.

2430
01:49:38,161 --> 01:49:40,610
Like maybe.
But that makes me like usually performed

2431
01:49:40,611 --> 01:49:41,240
better.
Yeah.

2432
01:49:41,530 --> 01:49:42,100
I'll,
you know,

2433
01:49:42,130 --> 01:49:44,070
I'll be a little bit sharper.
I'll try.

2434
01:49:44,071 --> 01:49:46,680
I'll be a little bit more alert,
which is everything,

2435
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:48,020
right?
Comedy clubs give me a

2436
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:51,760
theater sometimes 2000 peoples a lot.
For me.

2437
01:49:51,820 --> 01:49:53,990
It's weird.
It's a different sort of experience.

2438
01:49:54,130 --> 01:49:59,130
I did a trap in Atlantic city and it's 
the only 2000 seater that I do that.

2439
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:04,150
That has so much a meaning for me.
I've done them in Canada than.

2440
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:06,520
But like my family's there.
My friends are there.

2441
01:50:06,521 --> 01:50:09,130
It's my home and that's a little 
fucking.

2442
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:11,110
That's where I get a little bit,
you know?

2443
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:16,290
Yeah.
I filled in my stomach was a lot of 

2444
01:50:16,290 --> 01:50:16,810
fucking human beings.
Stands in $2,000,

2445
01:50:16,811 --> 01:50:19,210
bucks a lot of materials to an hour and 
10.

2446
01:50:19,470 --> 01:50:20,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

2447
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:22,550
It's fun though.
Snow,

2448
01:50:22,570 --> 01:50:25,420
better Gig on the planet.
So fun.

2449
01:50:25,690 --> 01:50:28,600
I've done so many different things,
but there's nothing like the comedy.

2450
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:32,240
Nothing like stand up,
nothing like that either as a,

2451
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:34,660
an audience member.
Like I like a lot of things.

2452
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:40,440
Obviously.
I like a different sports and like mma 

2453
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:41,350
and uh,
I like going to movies,

2454
01:50:41,351 --> 01:50:45,550
but I like going to see a really great 
stand up.

2455
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:46,330
I learned.
Yeah,

2456
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:49,710
it's fun and laugh and be separate 
yourself from it.

2457
01:50:50,150 --> 01:50:53,710
I did get excited is still I like when I
see someone who's really good,

2458
01:50:53,711 --> 01:50:55,090
I want to go right?
Yeah,

2459
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:55,870
yeah,
definitely.

2460
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:57,010
Oh yeah,
a hundred percent.

2461
01:50:57,220 --> 01:51:02,220
I was left back to the other night and 
it's funny because it was the comedy 

2462
01:51:02,220 --> 01:51:03,770
store first and I didn't feel like I,
I canceled Friday,

2463
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:05,100
never cancel.
I was just beat.

2464
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:09,520
I and I sent,
Bill Burr said something that I had been

2465
01:51:09,521 --> 01:51:10,420
thinking.
He goes,

2466
01:51:10,421 --> 01:51:12,280
I just don't have anything to say 
tonight.

2467
01:51:12,281 --> 01:51:14,100
I don't feel funny.
I don't feel like going on.

2468
01:51:14,101 --> 01:51:17,630
And I thought I got it builds saying it,
you know,

2469
01:51:17,650 --> 01:51:21,550
somebody I respect so much and I always 
find that the comedy store,

2470
01:51:21,551 --> 01:51:26,440
but by the time I got to the laugh 
factory I was juiced and ready to go and

2471
01:51:26,441 --> 01:51:31,441
I loved it because it was,
I'm seeing all these college students 

2472
01:51:31,441 --> 01:51:33,130
laughing at me and you know,
it's very young crowd and there was four

2473
01:51:33,131 --> 01:51:35,380
slash 20 year old girls right in the 
front.

2474
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:40,440
I go,
when would I ever get a chance to talk 

2475
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:42,571
to you?
I'm like three feet away for 20 year 

2476
01:51:42,571 --> 01:51:47,131
olds.
I said you came up to you at a bar last 

2477
01:51:47,291 --> 01:51:48,630
pops,
you know,

2478
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:52,120
before I report to the manager and it 
was funny.

2479
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:53,200
It's fun,
man.

2480
01:51:54,790 --> 01:51:56,400
I'm still driven by that,
that,

2481
01:51:56,500 --> 01:52:00,190
that ego with showing off in front of 
pretty girls.

2482
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:05,280
It's really that.
How much of a factor is that in your 

2483
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:05,280
factor?
It's,

2484
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:05,890
I mean,
I get a kick out of it.

2485
01:52:05,891 --> 01:52:09,010
I get a kick out of making them laugh 
and you know,

2486
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:13,120
tough guys,
something fucking crack.

2487
01:52:13,121 --> 01:52:16,480
Like a guy who looks like a gang member,
you know,

2488
01:52:16,481 --> 01:52:20,830
I see him in the fucking just get the 
whole gang member dodger jacket.

2489
01:52:21,010 --> 01:52:23,880
So just like little challenges.
Yeah,

2490
01:52:24,580 --> 01:52:29,580
that's part of the fun of it for sure.
I just think it's amazing when you can 

2491
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:29,680
translate to other groups,
you know?

2492
01:52:29,950 --> 01:52:34,950
I mean let's face it,
if I was fucking stuck with Gumbos my 

2493
01:52:34,950 --> 01:52:34,950
age,
I'd be dead in the water.

2494
01:52:34,950 --> 01:52:37,270
You have to translate,
you have to go across generations.

2495
01:52:37,690 --> 01:52:41,150
My favorite is old ladies that laugh at 
me in that grade is my favorite and they

2496
01:52:41,210 --> 01:52:43,780
see them fucking crying.
Like if you see like a girl,

2497
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:46,280
like sometimes they get college could 
have come over to grandmother,

2498
01:52:46,850 --> 01:52:49,640
see them both laughing at a joke,
you know,

2499
01:52:49,850 --> 01:52:51,800
the first time in her life to do,
you know,

2500
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:53,360
a seed be amazed.
I mean,

2501
01:52:53,361 --> 01:52:56,060
especially because the old ladies today,
they'll like,

2502
01:52:56,061 --> 01:52:58,310
you know,
they were around in the seventies,

2503
01:52:58,770 --> 01:52:59,990
eighties,
you know,

2504
01:52:59,991 --> 01:53:03,020
and now they're in the sixties and 
seventies and coming out to comedy clubs

2505
01:53:03,021 --> 01:53:05,360
like they have pretty God damn good 
sense of humor.

2506
01:53:05,390 --> 01:53:05,990
Yeah,
right.

2507
01:53:05,991 --> 01:53:07,790
They didn't grow up in an innocent 
depression.

2508
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:10,310
They didn't grow up in the depression.
That's a difference between,

2509
01:53:10,390 --> 01:53:11,660
you know,
our parents,

2510
01:53:11,661 --> 01:53:16,661
parents and,
and these people that are coming up 

2511
01:53:16,661 --> 01:53:16,661
today.
Yeah.

2512
01:53:16,661 --> 01:53:18,380
It's a more relaxed bunch.
I grew up with Jimi Hendrix.

2513
01:53:18,381 --> 01:53:19,630
Yeah,
there's,

2514
01:53:19,631 --> 01:53:20,140
I,
I've,

2515
01:53:20,141 --> 01:53:23,680
I've had a lot of like older gray haired
folks come up to me after shows and.

2516
01:53:23,770 --> 01:53:24,800
Great.
Beautiful.

2517
01:53:24,830 --> 01:53:25,790
Yeah.
That's awesome.

2518
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:30,290
So there's no reason to not just enjoy 
yourself and have fun.

2519
01:53:30,290 --> 01:53:30,650
Like,
oh,

2520
01:53:30,651 --> 01:53:35,651
this is like,
we have a lot of self imposed 

2521
01:53:35,651 --> 01:53:38,141
restrictions on the way we view things 
and the looseness in which we approach 

2522
01:53:38,141 --> 01:53:41,861
things.
And a lot of it is just because people 

2523
01:53:41,861 --> 01:53:41,861
have to work,
you know,

2524
01:53:41,861 --> 01:53:42,830
they have to be serious because they 
have to work all day Shitty fucking jobs

2525
01:53:42,831 --> 01:53:43,820
all day.
It's hard.

2526
01:53:44,270 --> 01:53:49,270
It's hard to.
It's hard to really have time to step 

2527
01:53:49,270 --> 01:53:52,721
back and make fun of it all and step 
back and look at it for what it really 

2528
01:53:52,721 --> 01:53:55,721
is.
Some weird temporary state that could 

2529
01:53:55,721 --> 01:53:55,721
end at any minute.
Yeah.

2530
01:53:55,721 --> 01:54:00,150
You know,
it's gotta be a weird thing to be a 

2531
01:54:00,150 --> 01:54:04,121
person who's an old person.
It's just locked and rigid and set in 

2532
01:54:04,121 --> 01:54:08,411
their ways and not seeing the end coming
like a God damn freight train just 

2533
01:54:08,411 --> 01:54:13,090
rolling down the track and they're just 
going to get philosophical with rogue 

2534
01:54:13,090 --> 01:54:17,100
act and Conti fucking fucking energy in 
life.

2535
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:22,540
We know a lot of folks like that though.
I think it's funny the guys who won't 

2536
01:54:22,540 --> 01:54:22,540
talk,
you know,

2537
01:54:22,540 --> 01:54:25,670
don't they don't talk a certain way in 
front of women and yet they have no idea

2538
01:54:25,671 --> 01:54:28,630
that the group of women are fucking 
pigs.

2539
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:31,790
Talking about fucking sucking cock.
And Alicia.

2540
01:54:32,990 --> 01:54:34,670
Yeah.
There's some guys that are just.

2541
01:54:34,890 --> 01:54:38,960
There's other boys club guys.
Some guys don't want to know either.

2542
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:42,230
There's some guys that don't want to 
know that women,

2543
01:54:42,350 --> 01:54:47,350
like some guys want like really innocent
fantast choker women.

2544
01:54:48,170 --> 01:54:53,170
Well,
maybe they just want to find that one 

2545
01:54:53,170 --> 01:54:54,650
girl from Wisconsin came here and hasn't
been spoiled yet.

2546
01:54:54,651 --> 01:54:57,180
Tom Or mary ever think about that.
Yeah,

2547
01:54:57,190 --> 01:54:57,850
I did.
All right.

2548
01:54:57,950 --> 01:54:58,910
Okay.
Okay.

2549
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:00,500
Don't jump down.
Don't get fresh.

2550
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:03,830
Do you ever hit the whatever happened to
give me the business.

2551
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:06,680
It gives me the business that ever 
happened to fresh.

2552
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:09,080
I think we should bring that back like 
don't get fresh.

2553
01:55:10,010 --> 01:55:12,590
I think that is a nice thing you can say
to be.

2554
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:15,690
Jamie today is running a podcast.
He was holy Christ.

2555
01:55:15,710 --> 01:55:17,450
Why do you let him on the podcast?
First of all,

2556
01:55:17,510 --> 01:55:19,750
I thought he wanted to come.
Very.

2557
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:22,700
Summit was on your beautiful man,
but that's a terrible idea.

2558
01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:24,560
He was.
He was doing a filibuster.

2559
01:55:24,970 --> 01:55:26,480
I said Jamie did.
He would tell you.

2560
01:55:26,481 --> 01:55:29,390
He was telling the guests to shut up by.
Listen to me.

2561
01:55:29,391 --> 01:55:33,230
I've been running the laugh factory in 
1975.

2562
01:55:33,231 --> 01:55:36,030
I work.
I work for the.

2563
01:55:36,031 --> 01:55:38,120
Hold on buddy.
He kept saying,

2564
01:55:38,121 --> 01:55:43,121
the pressure shut up,
I have a guest on and tell them to shut 

2565
01:55:43,121 --> 01:55:43,160
up.
These are fucking guests.

2566
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:44,700
He was brutal.
So many people.

2567
01:55:44,701 --> 01:55:46,770
That podcast I did with you and him,
they were like,

2568
01:55:46,771 --> 01:55:47,880
please don't ever bring them.

2569
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:50,910
It was like the majority of the 
comments.

2570
01:55:50,911 --> 01:55:55,911
I was like,
who the fuck is that guy and why is he 

2571
01:55:55,911 --> 01:55:55,911
on with Joe and dom that tells you what 
they said to they go,

2572
01:55:55,911 --> 01:55:57,060
we think you're not the majority.
I made that up.

2573
01:55:57,180 --> 01:56:00,090
We think you're funny,
but you got to lose the little Mexican,

2574
01:56:00,540 --> 01:56:02,130
the quantum,
a little Mexican boy.

2575
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:04,590
Why are you blaming this on Mexicans?
He's,

2576
01:56:04,710 --> 01:56:09,710
he's Iranian Jewish Israel,
but what a fucking character that's 

2577
01:56:09,710 --> 01:56:13,740
being really shitty at being racist 
thinking he's Mexican and it's like,

2578
01:56:13,741 --> 01:56:15,450
you're racist.
You just suck at it.

2579
01:56:15,630 --> 01:56:19,310
You even suck at being a racist.
What do you do the fucking Mexican,

2580
01:56:19,380 --> 01:56:22,290
like defeat.
Even Bobby,

2581
01:56:22,370 --> 01:56:27,090
listen to me when I was in a small 
country a long time ago.

2582
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:32,540
Yeah,
that sounds exactly like a Mexican I 

2583
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:35,760
hear,
but they listen to me.

2584
01:56:36,140 --> 01:56:41,140
Listen,
I've been working laugh factory since 

2585
01:56:41,140 --> 01:56:41,140
1976.

2586
01:56:41,140 --> 01:56:44,370
Every year was sooner.
He gets younger when they came over here

2587
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:45,390
by dad.
Listen,

2588
01:56:45,391 --> 01:56:49,650
I was six years old.
I came by myself,

2589
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:53,620
by the microphone.
I sneak them in my underwear,

2590
01:56:53,810 --> 01:56:55,080
like,
come to Medica.

2591
01:56:56,020 --> 01:56:57,960
Silly Bitch.
Those buddy.

2592
01:56:57,961 --> 01:56:59,340
Hey,
he's still kicking man.

2593
01:56:59,370 --> 01:57:02,580
Still supporting standup if it wasn't 
for guys like him.

2594
01:57:02,730 --> 01:57:04,680
People that own comedy clubs,
they're all crazy,

2595
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:06,480
but you have to be crazy to own a comedy
club.

2596
01:57:06,870 --> 01:57:10,050
He loves it.
He loves comedy and he loves the.

2597
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:12,600
This,
a few people that like,

2598
01:57:12,601 --> 01:57:15,900
um,
they drive comedy in this country.

2599
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:20,700
You know Wendy from Colorado from worse.
She drives comedy in Colorado,

2600
01:57:20,701 --> 01:57:22,260
but a story,
she was a waitress.

2601
01:57:22,261 --> 01:57:24,390
She ends up owning the club.
She's awesome.

2602
01:57:24,391 --> 01:57:27,600
She's a beautiful person too,
but she's drives comedy in Colorado.

2603
01:57:27,710 --> 01:57:32,710
Like she was one of the reasons why,
like when I wanted to escape to escape 

2604
01:57:32,710 --> 01:57:33,800
from La,
when I was looking at a place to go,

2605
01:57:33,820 --> 01:57:37,590
Colorado was one of my choices and one 
of the reasons being that she has like a

2606
01:57:37,591 --> 01:57:38,730
real comedy scene there.

2607
01:57:38,790 --> 01:57:40,200
It's like a legit comedy.
Says,

2608
01:57:41,110 --> 01:57:43,170
yeah,
she's got opened microbes all the way up

2609
01:57:43,171 --> 01:57:46,080
to headliners like local headliners and 
she works.

2610
01:57:46,081 --> 01:57:49,760
Those guys like she has like a whole 
like rotation and you know this,

2611
01:57:49,830 --> 01:57:54,830
you're allowed to do 10 minutes and here
you allow to do 15 minutes and she 

2612
01:57:54,830 --> 01:57:55,020
develops comics.
She has open Mike Nights.

2613
01:57:55,350 --> 01:57:57,210
A lot of people forgot about open Mike 
Nights.

2614
01:57:57,380 --> 01:57:58,730
Yeah,
Jamie still hasn't.

2615
01:57:58,940 --> 01:58:00,390
It's beautiful.
You have to have them.

2616
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:01,830
Yeah,
you have to have them.

2617
01:58:01,860 --> 01:58:06,860
There are so important.
It's the problem is a place like la 

2618
01:58:06,860 --> 01:58:06,860
where everybody thinks they're fucking 
funny.

2619
01:58:06,860 --> 01:58:10,880
Yeah.
You know which everybody's socks in the 

2620
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:13,161
beginning,
but some people suck to the point of no 

2621
01:58:13,161 --> 01:58:13,161
return.
You see it in soccer.

2622
01:58:13,161 --> 01:58:14,730
That being gay was terrible.
I didn't.

2623
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:16,410
You were awesome.
No,

2624
01:58:16,411 --> 01:58:21,411
I wouldn't say it was awesome,
but I think I didn't suck because I was 

2625
01:58:21,411 --> 01:58:21,411
already over my nerves because the 
acting.

2626
01:58:21,411 --> 01:58:21,840
Oh,
okay.

2627
01:58:21,930 --> 01:58:22,950
You know,
I mean I didn't,

2628
01:58:23,370 --> 01:58:25,050
I didn't have much of an act,
but I don't think.

2629
01:58:25,051 --> 01:58:30,051
I think I always could bail myself out.
I don't want to sound like a jerk off 

2630
01:58:30,051 --> 01:58:31,650
and send it in seven,
but I'm sure I would think I suck.

2631
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:34,050
I don't,
I'm not the biggest fan of money today.

2632
01:58:34,051 --> 01:58:37,980
So I was very socially anxious before I 
did stand up.

2633
01:58:38,010 --> 01:58:42,660
But I also was able to teach martial 
arts and uh,

2634
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:45,190
because I had taught so many martial 
arts classes,

2635
01:58:45,620 --> 01:58:50,620
um,
I had like a little bit less fear of 

2636
01:58:50,620 --> 01:58:54,121
talking about we should have had,
or at least you're doing public 

2637
01:58:54,121 --> 01:58:56,140
speaking.
I had conducted a class.

2638
01:58:56,141 --> 01:58:57,490
I took many classes,
you know,

2639
01:58:57,491 --> 01:59:00,560
this is what I was doing for a living.
How far did you go and martial arts?

2640
01:59:01,540 --> 01:59:06,540
When I was 19 I was teaching taekwondo 
at Boston University.

2641
01:59:07,620 --> 01:59:11,590
I was a black belt,
but I was a windows black I think when I

2642
01:59:11,591 --> 01:59:15,010
was 16 or 17,
so probably 17,

2643
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:17,340
somewhere around there.
And uh,

2644
01:59:17,341 --> 01:59:21,220
I won the Massachusetts state 
championship like four years in a while.

2645
01:59:21,570 --> 01:59:23,320
Yeah.
I want a couple of other.

2646
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:26,880
So good for your head to get hit.
No,

2647
01:59:26,881 --> 01:59:29,560
I mean the emotional head.
Well,

2648
01:59:29,570 --> 01:59:31,570
it was for me,
for me at the time it was big,

2649
01:59:32,350 --> 01:59:33,550
but uh,
the teaching,

2650
01:59:33,790 --> 01:59:36,760
it was really satisfying watching people
learn things.

2651
01:59:36,790 --> 01:59:38,260
That's what I,
I learned.

2652
01:59:38,590 --> 01:59:43,590
I really love sharing things and I also 
learned that in sharing like teaching 

2653
01:59:44,291 --> 01:59:49,291
techniques with people,
I really concentrated on my own 

2654
01:59:49,291 --> 01:59:49,291
techniques,
like a,

2655
01:59:49,291 --> 01:59:52,951
I think a lot of my kicks and a lot of 
my movements got even sharper because I 

2656
01:59:52,951 --> 01:59:56,551
was teaching them to be,
but like it was breaking them down and 

2657
01:59:56,551 --> 01:59:57,190
showing them how to do them from scratch
and then have like a few people.

2658
01:59:57,190 --> 02:00:02,020
There was this one girl that I trained,
she came in as a white belt and then she

2659
02:00:02,021 --> 02:00:05,560
got all the way up to,
I don't want anybody to get mad at me,

2660
02:00:05,561 --> 02:00:07,480
but I believe it was yellow,
green,

2661
02:00:07,540 --> 02:00:08,530
blue,
red,

2662
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:10,360
black.
I think that was a thing.

2663
02:00:10,361 --> 02:00:13,630
She got up to blue which was a pretty,
you know,

2664
02:00:13,631 --> 02:00:18,631
pretty high and I'm means you're 
starting to compete against people that 

2665
02:00:18,631 --> 02:00:22,711
are there.
Other dangerous they can kick in the 

2666
02:00:22,711 --> 02:00:22,711
fast,
you could get crazy.

2667
02:00:22,711 --> 02:00:23,620
And she won this tournament and I was 
coaching,

2668
02:00:23,890 --> 02:00:28,890
so I coached her from the time she was a
white path all the way to the till the 

2669
02:00:28,890 --> 02:00:28,890
time she was like,
that's cool.

2670
02:00:28,890 --> 02:00:29,350
That's amazing.
Yeah,

2671
02:00:29,351 --> 02:00:31,090
it was amazing.
And she was a young kid.

2672
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:34,120
She was in high school and uh,
she was,

2673
02:00:34,121 --> 02:00:35,260
uh,
she was really talented.

2674
02:00:35,261 --> 02:00:38,290
She just knew how to listen and she knew
how to listen and she knew how to do.

2675
02:00:38,370 --> 02:00:43,370
Like when I,
what I explained she could like and she 

2676
02:00:43,370 --> 02:00:46,891
was like super focused.
It was really interesting teaching 

2677
02:00:46,891 --> 02:00:50,311
someone something and seeing something 
like someone completely dive into 

2678
02:00:50,311 --> 02:00:51,530
something that you,
you appreciate.

2679
02:00:51,550 --> 02:00:55,660
And watching them get better at it.
So rewarding to be able to pass that on.

2680
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:59,020
I always used to remember like my 
instructor,

2681
02:00:59,220 --> 02:01:04,220
um,
when like there was guys that were 

2682
02:01:04,220 --> 02:01:04,220
really good in the class and they did 
something really good,

2683
02:01:04,220 --> 02:01:08,911
you know,
whether it was a sparring demonstration 

2684
02:01:08,911 --> 02:01:08,911
or whether they,
uh,

2685
02:01:08,911 --> 02:01:09,910
did a drill in the bag or something like
that.

2686
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:15,400
He had his beam of joy in his eyes when 
he saw you do it really well.

2687
02:01:15,401 --> 02:01:15,930
Like,
you know,

2688
02:01:15,940 --> 02:01:19,930
like when you really take it,
know he would get excited and like that,

2689
02:01:19,950 --> 02:01:22,870
like you could see it as like,
I didn't understand it then,

2690
02:01:22,871 --> 02:01:25,260
but when I started teaching I realized 
like there you,

2691
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:29,860
you're taking part in someone's joy by 
helping them create something by helping

2692
02:01:29,861 --> 02:01:33,430
them create these movements and figuring
out how to do these movements correctly.

2693
02:01:33,700 --> 02:01:36,250
That it's not just like learning how to 
kick,

2694
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:41,480
it's like it's like tapping into this,
this area where you have control over 

2695
02:01:41,631 --> 02:01:46,631
the whole package.
Even for just a brief moment and he 

2696
02:01:46,631 --> 02:01:50,461
doing that.
Like there was a phrase that they had 

2697
02:01:50,461 --> 02:01:53,320
from the taekwondo,
a brochure when you signed up that I 

2698
02:01:53,320 --> 02:01:56,900
never forget.
Said that it was a vehicle for 

2699
02:01:56,900 --> 02:01:58,480
developing your human potential.
So like that's,

2700
02:01:58,490 --> 02:02:01,070
that's how I thought of it and that's 
how I would teach it.

2701
02:02:01,460 --> 02:02:04,900
So when you were teaching that you like,
it's like I had an opportunity,

2702
02:02:04,901 --> 02:02:09,901
I was felt like I had an opportunity to 
show somebody something that can change 

2703
02:02:09,901 --> 02:02:11,540
their life and I'll show you what 
changed my life.

2704
02:02:11,570 --> 02:02:12,980
I'll show it to you and you can do it 
too.

2705
02:02:12,981 --> 02:02:17,981
And it'll change your life to you.
You will literally become a different 

2706
02:02:17,981 --> 02:02:17,981
person.
You know,

2707
02:02:17,981 --> 02:02:22,930
I taught fourth grade and now those kids
are grown up and that's really cool 

2708
02:02:23,150 --> 02:02:25,790
because some of them told me it was the 
best year of their lives.

2709
02:02:25,940 --> 02:02:28,190
They come to see me do stand up.
Oh,

2710
02:02:28,191 --> 02:02:29,270
that's amazing.
Very cool.

2711
02:02:29,271 --> 02:02:32,140
Will you teach and what grade to you 
know everything but oh,

2712
02:02:32,141 --> 02:02:34,550
fourth grade is different than science.
Everything.

2713
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:35,210
I mean,
yeah,

2714
02:02:35,211 --> 02:02:40,211
it's different than what you did because
you went to people who had like an 

2715
02:02:40,211 --> 02:02:42,820
interest and a love for something.
And when did the explorer you were,

2716
02:02:42,830 --> 02:02:44,390
you were doing.
But mine is different.

2717
02:02:44,391 --> 02:02:47,740
They had to be there.
So my thing was self doubt,

2718
02:02:47,750 --> 02:02:52,750
self esteem.
I figured I can't teach these subjects 

2719
02:02:52,750 --> 02:02:55,781
are going to come and go in their lives,
but teaching them self esteem and some 

2720
02:02:55,781 --> 02:02:57,420
of the most rewarding things where like 
I had this one kid who was real shy,

2721
02:02:57,421 --> 02:02:58,340
he was so shy.

2722
02:02:58,430 --> 02:03:00,830
He was real tall and he was embarrassed 
by it.

2723
02:03:01,310 --> 02:03:03,110
And he would stay in the car and the 
cloak,

2724
02:03:03,380 --> 02:03:05,210
cloak room,
they'd call it a,

2725
02:03:05,220 --> 02:03:10,220
you know,
we're all the coats and they just stay 

2726
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:10,220
in there.
It won't come out.

2727
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:12,671
I go sky,
Sky King because he was a space cadet 

2728
02:03:12,671 --> 02:03:12,671
goes sky,
you got to come out,

2729
02:03:12,671 --> 02:03:14,960
you can't stay.
I can't let a kid just sitting,

2730
02:03:14,990 --> 02:03:19,990
you know.
And by the end of me just like work in 

2731
02:03:19,990 --> 02:03:22,550
his self esteem and all.
He was in the middle of the class,

2732
02:03:22,610 --> 02:03:24,500
just what everybody else waving his 
hand.

2733
02:03:24,510 --> 02:03:29,510
And his mother came up to me and she was
really touched by it and told me that I 

2734
02:03:29,510 --> 02:03:31,850
changed his life and you know,
that kind of Shit's cool.

2735
02:03:31,851 --> 02:03:34,790
And now I got a couple of the girls come
to see me and she goes,

2736
02:03:35,060 --> 02:03:40,060
one of the girls goes,
Ms Dot Turner or why did you let us do 

2737
02:03:40,060 --> 02:03:40,060
so much stuff?

2738
02:03:40,060 --> 02:03:40,730
You know,
like I said,

2739
02:03:40,731 --> 02:03:43,590
because you were smarter than me.
I said she'd go with me.

2740
02:03:43,591 --> 02:03:44,120
I said,
look,

2741
02:03:44,121 --> 02:03:44,400
you know,
I,

2742
02:03:44,590 --> 02:03:46,370
I had more knowledge because I was an 
adult.

2743
02:03:46,371 --> 02:03:48,680
But you know,
kids love of you have more brainpower to

2744
02:03:48,681 --> 02:03:51,470
me.
I know I wasn't dumb.

2745
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:53,240
I was smart enough to know that I 
wasn't.

2746
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:56,660
That's why you ran the class.
Know what I mean to say you were an easy

2747
02:03:56,661 --> 02:03:58,190
teacher.
That's where he talks real easy.

2748
02:03:58,640 --> 02:04:00,170
I told them at the beginning of the 
year,

2749
02:04:00,171 --> 02:04:00,650
I said,
look,

2750
02:04:00,651 --> 02:04:02,930
I want this to be the most fun year of 
your life.

2751
02:04:03,410 --> 02:04:05,080
Only you can mess it up.
I said,

2752
02:04:05,450 --> 02:04:07,580
fucking awesome opportunity.
That must have been.

2753
02:04:07,610 --> 02:04:09,140
And I said,
I want to go to the gym.

2754
02:04:09,141 --> 02:04:10,340
This is one.
I was playing basketball.

2755
02:04:10,341 --> 02:04:15,341
I said,
I want to go to the gym more than you 

2756
02:04:15,341 --> 02:04:15,341
do.

2757
02:04:15,341 --> 02:04:17,620
So the.
We were going to have a party every 

2758
02:04:17,620 --> 02:04:17,620
Friday afternoon.
Well,

2759
02:04:17,620 --> 02:04:21,730
I would have.
We'd have like kids that would do break 

2760
02:04:21,730 --> 02:04:21,730
dancing and stuff.
And Really?

2761
02:04:21,730 --> 02:04:21,730
Yeah,
it was.

2762
02:04:21,730 --> 02:04:22,430
Whoa.
That's awesome.

2763
02:04:22,431 --> 02:04:27,431
That was great.
Did you ever try to pitch that as a 

2764
02:04:27,431 --> 02:04:29,381
sitcom a no,
but somebody else had an idea for a 

2765
02:04:29,381 --> 02:04:30,590
couple times.
It would be hilarious Sitcom.

2766
02:04:30,650 --> 02:04:32,270
It seems like a natural.
Yeah.

2767
02:04:32,330 --> 02:04:37,330
You as a,
as a funny teacher because you really 

2768
02:04:37,330 --> 02:04:40,511
did it.
It's legit and if you really stop and 

2769
02:04:40,511 --> 02:04:40,770
think about it,
that would be like for a kid that's like

2770
02:04:40,771 --> 02:04:43,980
one of the greatest rolls of the dice.
A kid can get for a fourth grade teacher

2771
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:46,170
at Dow.
Rarer for you.

2772
02:04:46,171 --> 02:04:48,440
Fourth Grade Teacher,
she still calls me Mr Herrera,

2773
02:04:48,450 --> 02:04:53,450
she,
she's 26 years old or 26 when I say 

2774
02:04:53,450 --> 02:04:53,450
whatever,
and then she calls me Mr.

2775
02:04:53,450 --> 02:04:56,080
I rarer right and I go,
Theresa,

2776
02:04:56,160 --> 02:04:57,510
first of all,
you're taller than me.

2777
02:04:58,350 --> 02:05:01,110
She's always hot blonde.
I go stop with the Mr.

2778
02:05:01,240 --> 02:05:03,720
either call me dumb because I just can't
call you dumb.

2779
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:06,590
That funny.
Like she's got you got me down as Mr.

2780
02:05:07,170 --> 02:05:07,760
that's good.

2781
02:05:08,410 --> 02:05:10,000
That'll keep you from being a dirty 
bird.

2782
02:05:10,450 --> 02:05:11,240
Whoa,
Whoa,

2783
02:05:11,241 --> 02:05:12,610
whoa.
Stay away.

2784
02:05:12,620 --> 02:05:15,000
Dom known as since she's a little girl.
Let him talk.

2785
02:05:15,060 --> 02:05:17,260
Call you ms dot rush.
Trying to establish boundaries.

2786
02:05:17,261 --> 02:05:19,390
Somebody said,
why are you so young?

2787
02:05:19,391 --> 02:05:21,130
I go,
because I can come on.

2788
02:05:22,450 --> 02:05:27,450
Oh Geez.
That was one of my favorite bits that I 

2789
02:05:32,920 --> 02:05:35,560
mean it wasn't even like a.
It was like almost like an interstitial.

2790
02:05:35,750 --> 02:05:39,220
It was fun to do it in between.
Just to kill.

2791
02:05:39,430 --> 02:05:40,540
Come up folks.
Give a little,

2792
02:05:40,570 --> 02:05:45,570
get off your high horses.
Even jokes that were killing you would 

2793
02:05:45,570 --> 02:05:45,640
throw that ever.
Nathan Lane?

2794
02:05:46,150 --> 02:05:48,270
Nathan Lane?
Yes.

2795
02:05:48,271 --> 02:05:51,190
It was like a musical,
but a bunch of them.

2796
02:05:51,191 --> 02:05:52,150
He's great.
He's.

2797
02:05:52,151 --> 02:05:52,840
He lives in New York.

2798
02:05:52,900 --> 02:05:56,300
It was in the producers.
I shouldn't even say cut your fall.

2799
02:05:56,690 --> 02:05:58,120
Anyway,
he used to give me.

2800
02:05:58,160 --> 02:06:00,220
Houston had a great.
His great memory and he wouldn't.

2801
02:06:00,221 --> 02:06:05,221
I would do that.
Fritzy Anderson character and he would 

2802
02:06:05,221 --> 02:06:07,711
remember she goes,
get off your high horse because I would 

2803
02:06:07,711 --> 02:06:07,711
go.
Your high horses.

2804
02:06:07,711 --> 02:06:08,200
Come down up here were exalted 
mountains,

2805
02:06:08,470 --> 02:06:10,270
retreat for your fatigue.
Plateaus.

2806
02:06:10,271 --> 02:06:15,271
Come out folks out and it was just so 
much fun to do because it was so 

2807
02:06:15,271 --> 02:06:18,250
physical and loud and was like,
we used to kill my voice.

2808
02:06:18,730 --> 02:06:20,370
What do you call a dog with no legs?
Not In,

2809
02:06:20,380 --> 02:06:21,540
no matter what you call me.
Hey,

2810
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:23,920
come in.
Where did I lose you?

2811
02:06:26,650 --> 02:06:28,600
Hello?
Yeah.

2812
02:06:28,601 --> 02:06:30,900
Having characters that you can just 
bring back like that.

2813
02:06:30,901 --> 02:06:32,410
So it was fun.
That was a fun

2814
02:06:32,490 --> 02:06:33,420
character.
It was just like,

2815
02:06:33,450 --> 02:06:38,450
oh,
it was a conglomeration of every lounge 

2816
02:06:38,450 --> 02:06:40,010
mountain comedian I've ever seen.
You know,

2817
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:45,160
like the sappy songs.
I write the jokes to make the whole 

2818
02:06:45,160 --> 02:06:45,210
world smile,

2819
02:06:46,820 --> 02:06:47,750
you know,
that kind of guy.

2820
02:06:48,650 --> 02:06:53,650
I had a nightmare last night,
I guess it was last night that I bombed 

2821
02:06:53,650 --> 02:06:57,690
on stage in a hell Gig and long island.
Wow.

2822
02:06:57,750 --> 02:06:59,850
Very specific.
Oh God.

2823
02:06:59,851 --> 02:07:04,320
Because the long island was a.
I did a lot of hell gigs in Long Island.

2824
02:07:06,180 --> 02:07:11,180
Yeah.
You've done brokerage and governors and 

2825
02:07:11,180 --> 02:07:14,150
did the nice places too.
But I also did fast eddies and 

2826
02:07:14,150 --> 02:07:14,150
Huntington.
I didn't know that.

2827
02:07:14,150 --> 02:07:14,150
That was,
uh,

2828
02:07:14,710 --> 02:07:17,040
it was when I,
my manager,

2829
02:07:17,100 --> 02:07:21,840
I got my manager convinced to let me be 
dirty because Jeff,

2830
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:25,890
whichever looked at the beginning,
you picked me up and I was a scrub.

2831
02:07:26,230 --> 02:07:31,230
He picked me up.
I was an open mic or we'd been together 

2832
02:07:31,230 --> 02:07:31,230
forever.
He's the best he is,

2833
02:07:31,230 --> 02:07:31,800
but I love him too.
He's my friend,

2834
02:07:31,830 --> 02:07:33,120
you know,
just a manager.

2835
02:07:33,121 --> 02:07:34,940
He said the best manager and I love 
them.

2836
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:35,750
But,
uh,

2837
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:36,910
in the beginning,
you know,

2838
02:07:36,911 --> 02:07:38,020
we were still trying to figure it out.

2839
02:07:38,020 --> 02:07:43,020
I was only like 27 years old,
I didn't know shit and maybe you should 

2840
02:07:43,020 --> 02:07:43,510
be clean like that was back in the day 
where everybody should be clean,

2841
02:07:43,970 --> 02:07:45,520
you know.
And I'd done some clean sets,

2842
02:07:45,521 --> 02:07:47,160
do,
like he asked me to do what I think I,

2843
02:07:47,180 --> 02:07:49,840
he asked me to do one clean set for him.
So I did a clean set at like,

2844
02:07:49,841 --> 02:07:52,500
catch a rising star.
But then we went to um,

2845
02:07:52,910 --> 02:07:53,980
um,
uh,

2846
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:56,110
the,
the place that was way out.

2847
02:07:56,470 --> 02:07:57,340
Was it east side?
Yeah,

2848
02:07:57,341 --> 02:08:02,341
east side comedy club went out.
I did a settle there and then we did a 

2849
02:08:02,341 --> 02:08:04,040
set at this fast Eddie's place in this 
fascinating place to live.

2850
02:08:05,140 --> 02:08:07,570
And there was a dude named George Gallo 
and if you remember him,

2851
02:08:07,900 --> 02:08:12,900
he was onstage and he,
it real physical act and he was doing 

2852
02:08:12,900 --> 02:08:15,721
this thing where he would do a reverse 
shit with a banana to,

2853
02:08:18,140 --> 02:08:23,140
I guess he would like put the banana,
like fully formed on his lips then suck 

2854
02:08:23,140 --> 02:08:23,740
it back into his mouth or something like
that.

2855
02:08:23,740 --> 02:08:25,390
And he called the reverse shit with a 
banana.

2856
02:08:26,820 --> 02:08:28,330
And so Jeff,
I'll never forget,

2857
02:08:28,331 --> 02:08:29,530
he looks over at me.
He goes,

2858
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:31,660
you don't have to do this,
I'm going to get you out of this.

2859
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:32,830
And I go,
no,

2860
02:08:32,840 --> 02:08:33,330
no,
no,

2861
02:08:33,331 --> 02:08:34,960
no.
I told them,

2862
02:08:34,961 --> 02:08:36,160
I go,
these are my people.

2863
02:08:36,161 --> 02:08:36,940
I go,
trust me,

2864
02:08:36,941 --> 02:08:39,730
we're going to be fine here.
I know how to make these people laugh.

2865
02:08:39,860 --> 02:08:43,780
And so I went up and did my gig material
because I did so many hell gigs.

2866
02:08:43,830 --> 02:08:45,460
That's when they started being dirty 
again.

2867
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:50,520
What was the one he was convinced he 
gave in watching that one set in this 

2868
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:55,470
crazy nightclub?
Like it was the end of discussion 

2869
02:08:55,470 --> 02:08:55,470
whether it should be clean.
He goes,

2870
02:08:55,470 --> 02:08:56,110
okay,
we just got to concentrate on,

2871
02:08:56,111 --> 02:09:01,060
just go all dirty.
So he said he's the best.

2872
02:09:01,270 --> 02:09:06,270
Having a guy like that,
a as a manager just takes all the worry 

2873
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:10,810
out of like career and handling things.

2874
02:09:10,810 --> 02:09:13,150
You know,
like you've got a relationship like that

2875
02:09:13,151 --> 02:09:18,151
with God.
You love the guy like family and it's 

2876
02:09:18,151 --> 02:09:20,200
also your manager.
It's really alleviates so much,

2877
02:09:20,230 --> 02:09:23,480
you know,
is the best.

2878
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:24,670
So Shandra,
they're the best,

2879
02:09:25,030 --> 02:09:27,790
but I just got so lucky that I met them,
you know,

2880
02:09:27,850 --> 02:09:32,850
just like cookie faces out there and a 
lot of crazy fucking people in show 

2881
02:09:32,850 --> 02:09:36,691
business.
I mean how many looney toons managers 

2882
02:09:36,691 --> 02:09:36,700
that we met,
how many people off the deep end,

2883
02:09:36,701 --> 02:09:41,701
how many people did fucking swindle 
people and wound up stealing money or 

2884
02:09:41,701 --> 02:09:45,070
owing money are embroiled in controversy
every other year.

2885
02:09:45,170 --> 02:09:47,280
Lenny Clarke got fucked,

2886
02:09:47,980 --> 02:09:48,520

He got fucked around as well.

2888
02:09:51,910 --> 02:09:56,910
A lot of guys did.

2889
02:09:56,910 --> 02:09:57,760

Oh,

2890
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:03,200

It's funny business.

2891
02:10:04,061 --> 02:10:04,920
We're,

long fucking time now.

2893
02:10:07,990 --> 02:10:10,390

2894
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:14,230
20 years of nine ball to think I'd be a 
little better.

I don't think there's ever been more 
funny guys around than now.

2934
02:11:52,970 --> 02:11:55,760
I don't think so either.

02:12:09,081 --> 02:12:11,240
I think they rank up with the funniest 
checks of all time.

2943
02:12:11,241 --> 02:12:12,230
I don't know.
Amy's work.

2944
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:14,900
Bonnie Mcfarland does as well.
She's fucking hilarious.

2945
02:12:15,170 --> 02:12:17,300
She's hilarious.
She's very smart.

2946
02:12:18,140 --> 02:12:20,660
She's a very smart person.
She sees things.

2947
02:12:20,870 --> 02:12:22,460
She points out things and you,
you know,

2948
02:12:22,670 --> 02:12:24,560
they make sense.
You go with it.

2949
02:12:24,670 --> 02:12:27,340
It's hilarious.
She was.

2950
02:12:27,430 --> 02:12:29,120
Yeah.
You ever heard the podcast?

2951
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:30,770
She gives me anxiety.
She tortures him.

2952
02:12:31,010 --> 02:12:33,390
That's torture.
So it hurts my feelings.

2953
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:38,810
Like rich did shop to shut the fuck up.
Just pleased rich.

2954
02:12:38,840 --> 02:12:41,550
Well,
she's hot or smarter.

2955
02:12:41,930 --> 02:12:44,570
I'm just saying that.
It's funny.

2956
02:12:44,571 --> 02:12:45,560
That's funny.
Podcast.

2957
02:12:45,720 --> 02:12:49,620
The best comedy coupled by far is a 
cigar and Christina Pedensky.

2958
02:12:51,210 --> 02:12:52,940
Christina,
you don't know her.

2959
02:12:53,470 --> 02:12:54,320
Thomas Girls.
Wife.

2960
02:12:54,830 --> 02:12:57,680
Dude,
that chick is fucking funny.

2961
02:12:58,160 --> 02:13:03,160
We did one of sand Tripoli shows,
you know Sam Tripoli Naughty show and 

2962
02:13:03,160 --> 02:13:03,250
Sam Tripoli's.
Naughty shows.

2963
02:13:03,260 --> 02:13:04,070
He's never seen him.
He does.

2964
02:13:04,071 --> 02:13:07,460
He shows the Improv and they're not just
comedy.

2965
02:13:07,700 --> 02:13:09,420
There's like all kinds of craziness to 
it.

2966
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:12,040
Stars.
They would like.

2967
02:13:12,260 --> 02:13:15,710
They played some thing where if the guy 
got the question wrong,

2968
02:13:15,711 --> 02:13:20,420
the porn star beating with a belt.
So this chick is like beaten this dude's

2969
02:13:20,421 --> 02:13:25,421
ass with the belt and everyone's 
screaming and going nuts in there and 

2970
02:13:25,421 --> 02:13:26,780
boom.
They bring Christina Palicki onstage and

2971
02:13:26,781 --> 02:13:29,210
I was,
she's very pretty,

2972
02:13:30,050 --> 02:13:32,060
but she's not like a porn star looking 
chick.

2973
02:13:32,060 --> 02:13:34,440
She was like a very pretty regular trip.
So,

2974
02:13:34,441 --> 02:13:36,990
um,
she goes on stage and by the way,

2975
02:13:37,230 --> 02:13:40,260
don't ever asked me if my wife and my 
friend's wife is hot.

2976
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:41,790
That's rude.
It's put you on the spot.

2977
02:13:42,300 --> 02:13:43,980
You son of a bitch,
it'd be you.

2978
02:13:44,230 --> 02:13:46,500
She's very pretty,
but you handled it well.

2979
02:13:46,850 --> 02:13:49,890
Said she's pretty for regulatory.
So it wasn't like she was selling sex.

2980
02:13:49,910 --> 02:13:51,560
She was just selling funny,
you know,

2981
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:53,370
she was going up there and being funny.
I mean,

2982
02:13:53,371 --> 02:13:54,060
she,
she doesn't,

2983
02:13:54,120 --> 02:13:56,630
she dresses like anybody.
Nice is.

2984
02:13:58,530 --> 02:13:59,790
I wouldn't say it was bad ass.

2985
02:14:02,230 --> 02:14:05,700
Try to be as respectful as possible.
Mr Mayor with all due respect.

2986
02:14:06,720 --> 02:14:07,470
And uh,
anyway,

2987
02:14:07,471 --> 02:14:09,000
she goes up there and I'm thinking,
man,

2988
02:14:09,001 --> 02:14:10,650
I just meet her right?
And she's with,

2989
02:14:10,770 --> 02:14:12,820
she's with Tom and I'm just like,
you know,

2990
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:15,750
she seemed so nice now for sure.
She's going to go eat deck up there.

2991
02:14:15,990 --> 02:14:20,990
It's going to be terrible how you follow
the guy just beat a dude's ass with a 

2992
02:14:20,990 --> 02:14:21,120
belt.
And everybody was screaming.

2993
02:14:21,150 --> 02:14:22,590
How do you follow it?
I took his pants down.

2994
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:27,220
I want to say yes.
I want to say at the very least,

2995
02:14:27,240 --> 02:14:32,240
like his underwear was.
He had his underwear on and they beat 

2996
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:32,240
his ass with a belt.
Like he got fucked up.

2997
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:34,530
I dude got hurt anyway.
Um,

2998
02:14:34,590 --> 02:14:37,830
she crush crush.
It just grabs it,

2999
02:14:38,130 --> 02:14:40,920
makes fun of it,
makes fun of the whole situation.

3000
02:14:40,950 --> 02:14:44,160
Relaxed gets two that gets to it on her 
own due time.

3001
02:14:44,190 --> 02:14:46,470
Just controlled the whole room like a 
pro.

3002
02:14:46,780 --> 02:14:48,870
It's so nice when you see that and be 
like,

3003
02:14:48,890 --> 02:14:53,890
oh,
she knows what she's doing because 

3004
02:14:53,890 --> 02:14:54,600
there's nothing worse than befriending 
someone.

3005
02:14:54,660 --> 02:14:59,660
And then you know,
you've never seen them before and you 

3006
02:14:59,660 --> 02:14:59,660
know,
it's like those,

3007
02:14:59,660 --> 02:15:02,160
those weird popping nights at the improv
where,

3008
02:15:02,161 --> 02:15:03,450
you know,
like a lot of times,

3009
02:15:03,451 --> 02:15:05,870
like on those Wednesday and Tuesday 
night shows like this,

3010
02:15:06,090 --> 02:15:11,090
some of the people in the crowd will be 
supporting the guy who was on stage and 

3011
02:15:11,090 --> 02:15:11,090
they bring like 10 people with them.
Right?

3012
02:15:11,230 --> 02:15:13,200
Yeah.
You never know.

3013
02:15:13,420 --> 02:15:15,850
I brought a girl,
didn't bring her there,

3014
02:15:15,851 --> 02:15:20,851
but she was,
she lives in Chicago and the laugh 

3015
02:15:20,851 --> 02:15:21,010
factory was in Chicago and I was doing 
it.

3016
02:15:21,050 --> 02:15:23,740
She asked me if she could do some time 
because her family's there.

3017
02:15:23,820 --> 02:15:26,500
I never even saw on stage.
She's hot.

3018
02:15:26,990 --> 02:15:29,050
Thank God.
Not only did she bring her family,

3019
02:15:29,051 --> 02:15:33,880
she put a shitload of people and she did
very well and she's really hot.

3020
02:15:33,910 --> 02:15:34,840
Wait a minute.
She's good.

3021
02:15:35,760 --> 02:15:40,760
I wouldn't say she's good,
but I mean she's probably not like an 

3022
02:15:40,760 --> 02:15:41,190
Kristina's Kristina's class.
Christina present split.

3023
02:15:41,320 --> 02:15:42,790
Uh,
she did very,

3024
02:15:42,820 --> 02:15:43,610
very well.
I mean,

3025
02:15:43,630 --> 02:15:44,760
she's a newcomer,
you know,

3026
02:15:44,800 --> 02:15:46,390
she's really,
really green.

3027
02:15:46,810 --> 02:15:48,550
But I mean,
like all it was,

3028
02:15:48,551 --> 02:15:50,080
was just like me going,
yeah,

3029
02:15:50,081 --> 02:15:50,830
you're hot.
Fuck,

3030
02:15:50,870 --> 02:15:52,330
I'll do seven minutes.
What do I care?

3031
02:15:52,480 --> 02:15:54,220
You know,
who impressed me the most?

3032
02:15:54,260 --> 02:15:59,260
Uh,
doing like a pop into like that little 

3033
02:15:59,260 --> 02:16:01,810
aster,
great Chicago theater down there was 

3034
02:16:01,810 --> 02:16:06,331
3,400
people there or whatever the fuck it 

3035
02:16:06,331 --> 02:16:06,331
seats.
It's more than 3000.

3036
02:16:06,331 --> 02:16:06,880
I don't know how many would say it's,
it's more than 3000.

3037
02:16:07,210 --> 02:16:07,960
She destroyed

3038
02:16:08,350 --> 02:16:09,600
that kid and yeah,
she's good.

3039
02:16:09,990 --> 02:16:12,840
She was funny on the podcast too.
There's so many

3040
02:16:12,910 --> 02:16:15,820
finally fucking people today.
This is crazy time.

3041
02:16:15,880 --> 02:16:17,140
Crazy time.
They came back,

3042
02:16:17,141 --> 02:16:17,830

I mean,

3043
02:16:17,950 --> 02:16:19,360

I did better.

3044
02:16:19,361 --> 02:16:20,450
I think it's better than ever.
I.

3045
02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:23,140
Yeah,
I really do like Kevin Hart.

3046
02:16:23,210 --> 02:16:26,380
I mean,
I'm think about,

3047
02:16:26,381 --> 02:16:28,000

3050
02:16:35,380 --> 02:16:37,060
David David.
Tell Dave,

3051
02:16:37,061 --> 02:16:39,100
Chappelle.
Chris Rock,

3052
02:16:39,101 --> 02:16:40,110
Louis C,

3053
02:16:40,550 --> 02:16:44,350
m a s,
tosh.

3054
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:47,650
Just stop right there.
I mean,

3055
02:16:47,651 --> 02:16:49,280
look at how many guys are dealing with 
there.

3056
02:16:49,281 --> 02:16:49,640
I mean.
Oh,

3057
02:16:49,650 --> 02:16:51,880
hey Patton Oswald.
You can't forget Patton Oswald.

3058
02:16:52,330 --> 02:16:55,210
He's one of the best.
There's so many good guys right now,

3059
02:16:55,211 --> 02:16:58,180
man.
There's so many fucking good guys.

3060
02:16:58,210 --> 02:16:58,630
No,
fuck.

3061
02:16:58,631 --> 02:17:03,631
It makes me laugh though,
even though he's not a traditional 

3062
02:17:03,631 --> 02:17:03,631
standup.
Who?

3063
02:17:03,631 --> 02:17:03,631
Andy kindler.
Oh,

3064
02:17:03,631 --> 02:17:04,240
he's hilarious.
He kills me.

3065
02:17:04,241 --> 02:17:07,350
He has a traditional standup.
He says he just makes fun of standards.

3066
02:17:07,351 --> 02:17:08,310
It makes fun of.
It's.

3067
02:17:08,390 --> 02:17:09,400
Yeah,
like he does.

3068
02:17:09,401 --> 02:17:14,401
So when he bombed,
he does better than when he's doing 

3069
02:17:14,401 --> 02:17:14,401
good.
Yeah.

3070
02:17:14,401 --> 02:17:15,430
No,
he's the funniest bomber ever.

3071
02:17:15,730 --> 02:17:16,920
He's awesome.
Yeah.

3072
02:17:16,990 --> 02:17:18,250
He's,
he's quite a character.

3073
02:17:18,251 --> 02:17:19,810
That guy.
Yeah.

3074
02:17:19,811 --> 02:17:21,190
We,
we live in good times.

3075
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:26,280
This is a great time for comedy and you 
know the fact that everybody has a 

3076
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:26,280
podcast now.
I think he's awesome.

3077
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:31,260
I just think it's one of the most 
amazing things ever that all these 

3078
02:17:31,260 --> 02:17:31,260
different people have something that 
connects to the act,

3079
02:17:31,260 --> 02:17:32,890
you know,
like you get to see the person,

3080
02:17:33,240 --> 02:17:35,140
like instead of just seeing the jokes on
stage,

3081
02:17:35,141 --> 02:17:37,450
you get to see the unfiltered human 
being.

3082
02:17:37,780 --> 02:17:42,780
You know,
you get to see them fuck around with 

3083
02:17:42,780 --> 02:17:42,780
shit.
Talking about serious shit.

3084
02:17:42,780 --> 02:17:43,990
Talk about not so serious shit.
Boss balls.

3085
02:17:44,020 --> 02:17:45,730
Be Silly.
It'd be a little ting.

3086
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:47,760
So little this little that is it wrong.

3087
02:17:48,410 --> 02:17:53,410
Bring up somebody for yourself.
Squarespace.com.

3088
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,380
Go there until you fucks

02:18:06,370 --> 02:18:09,290
Who is a fucker.

No motherfucker.
Hume might've fucker.

3094
02:18:13,870 --> 02:18:17,920
He told me that a test she came in to 
see as God daughter at the laugh factory

3095
02:18:18,340 --> 02:18:23,340
and I thought I was going to go up so he
agreed to do my radio show the radio 

3096
02:18:23,340 --> 02:18:23,650
show there.
At the time,

3097
02:18:23,820 --> 02:18:26,290
two years ago,
excuse me,

3098
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:28,450
and uh,
he goes,

3099
02:18:28,460 --> 02:18:29,130
yeah,
I says,

3100
02:18:29,140 --> 02:18:30,280
I'm not going on.
I'm tired.

3101
02:18:30,281 --> 02:18:30,760
He goes,
well,

3102
02:18:30,761 --> 02:18:33,160
if you're not going on,
I'm not fucking doing your podcast.

3103
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:35,560
I said,
you don't do it.

3104
02:18:35,561 --> 02:18:40,561
He goes,
there goes my gun in his fucking a that 

3105
02:18:40,561 --> 02:18:41,360
guy in restaurant in Vegas.
You pictures in a fucking yard.

3106
02:18:41,710 --> 02:18:42,390
I'm looking at.
Yeah.

3107
02:18:42,391 --> 02:18:44,750
I felt like a fucking fag looking at 
you.

3108
02:18:44,751 --> 02:18:49,751
What?
I'm taking a piss at the Joe Patches 

3109
02:18:49,751 --> 02:18:49,751
that or is this a joke?
No,

3110
02:18:49,751 --> 02:18:49,751
that's what he said.
Really?

3111
02:18:50,750 --> 02:18:53,800
Huh?
He said he felt like he was a fag.

3112
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:56,950
She just pulled your cock out and see 
what happens next.

3113
02:18:57,220 --> 02:19:00,610
Could you imagine if Joe Pesci just 
started mowing down your cock?

3114
02:19:00,640 --> 02:19:01,330
No,
I can't.

3115
02:19:01,331 --> 02:19:02,660
Even if you're,
you know,

3116
02:19:02,710 --> 02:19:07,710
obviously you're not gay,
but even if you just for the 

3117
02:19:07,710 --> 02:19:07,710
experiences,
what I'm saying,

3118
02:19:08,710 --> 02:19:13,060
that's a good point to keep in mind.
The next time we see him he brings it up

3119
02:19:13,061 --> 02:19:18,061
again.
While I was trying to figure out why he 

3120
02:19:18,061 --> 02:19:18,061
was telling you that.
Well,

3121
02:19:18,061 --> 02:19:19,480
because my picture was up above the 
urinal because he loves you.

3122
02:19:20,220 --> 02:19:24,340
Does Joe Pesci Cock in his hand and he 
just killed so memorable?

3123
02:19:24,341 --> 02:19:26,170
You had to bring it up.
