1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,140
His name is Chris Hadfield.
The book is and astronauts guide to life

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,410
on earth.
The book is in here that that's me.

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,030
I never forget.
I never remember.

4
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:17,920
Rather turn my laptop off.
You,

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,550
uh,
you were in space for 166 days.

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,410
Mazing.
That's insane.

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,520
It's,
it's when I sit on my dock and watch the

8
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:28,180
space station go over,
uh,

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,320
it's really hard to rationalize cause I 
know I was up there and I can remember 

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,501
all the details,
but to try and link in life on earth 

11
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:36,501
with,
uh,

12
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:37,770
with seeing that spotlight go across the
horizon,

13
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,780
it's still,
I haven't got sorted out of my head how 

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:42,780
to connect it.
Is that the longest of persons ever been

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,481
up there?
There was a Russian guy named Valerie 

16
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:47,481
poliakoff.
State of 14 months straight.

17
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:48,090
$400,
whatever that is.

18
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:49,620
Stays long time.
Wow.

19
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:50,270
Yeah.
No,

20
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,990
I'm nowhere near the record.

21
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,490
That's still increased.
One hundred 66 days is an incredible 

22
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,060
amount of time to be detached from 
gravity and floating around in space.

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,290
What is the effect on your body?
A big effects short term?

24
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,770
Huge.
Your body doesn't have to lift the blood

25
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:09,360
up to your head when you're weightless,
right?

26
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:14,361
So your whole cardiovascular system 
changes all the nice little mechanisms 

27
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:17,370
that squeeze the balloon that is your 
body to get the blood up to your head.

28
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,530
They stopped working.
Your heart gets smaller,

29
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,070
you start losing your skeleton.
Your balance system completely shuts 

30
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,571
down.
I mean it has no stimulus from gravity 

31
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:29,730
anymore.
So you become totally visually based.

32
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,520
So when you come home,
it's brutal.

33
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,190
Building all those things back up again.
Um,

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,590
and most of them you feel,
I mean,

35
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:39,240
you lose the callouses on the bottom of 
your feet.

36
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,390
It's kind of disgusting cause you're 
sure your feet are like a snake up 

37
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:44,390
there.

38
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,970
Over the bottom of your feet are 
shedding because you never used the 

39
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,061
bottom of your feet and you build up 
calluses on the top because you're 

40
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:50,580
always tucking your feet underneath 
things.

41
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,060
So when you come back,
you've even have to grow the calluses 

42
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,371
back in the bottom of your feet.
And the thing that takes the longest is 

43
00:01:58,371 --> 00:02:01,491
your skeleton.
I lost about eight percent of the bone 

44
00:02:01,491 --> 00:02:04,161
across my hips and butt.
It's grown back and within about a year 

45
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:06,570
of landing all hopefully be back to 
normal one year.

46
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:08,700
It takes one year for your body to fully
recover.

47
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,720
It took about four months before I could
run normally again where my body would 

48
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,990
get the blood out of my feet and pump it
properly back up to my head,

49
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:21,270
about four months,
which is almost as long as I was up in 

50
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,270
this trip.
But uh,

51
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,270
yeah,
the bone takes the longest,

52
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,310
but it's a,
it's automatic,

53
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,150
which is interesting.

54
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,180
My body got osteoporosis and it's 
reversing osteoporosis using some 

55
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,430
internal stimulus that we don't even 
understand.

56
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:35,790
So it makes a pretty good medical study 
for everybody.

57
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,880
I would imagine.
So how long is.

58
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,030
How long do you have to be in space 
before your body loses so much?

59
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:45,330
Massive skeleton and the first time you 
take a leak in space,

60
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,540
your urine is full of calcium and 
minerals.

61
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,070
We do urine samples all the time and 
your body,

62
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,400
we don't even know why.
We don't know what sensors in the body 

63
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,750
recognize that you're weightless or why 
we would even have those sensors,

64
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,300
but your body starts to shed your 
skeleton right away and we've,

65
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,230
we can almost beat it now through a 
heavy exercise.

66
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:10,231
We have a bunch of equipment on board,
a resistive exercise and treadmill and 

67
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,410
bicycle and stuff.
Um,

68
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,570
and with that we can almost beat it.

69
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:18,570
But across my hips and my upper femur,
we haven't been able to load that area 

70
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:18,570
up.
Right?

71
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,770
You always lift symmetrically on 
treadmill.

72
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:24,830
He always run nice and symmetrically so 
you don't get all the banging transverse

73
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,520
loads that you need to make your body 
keep the bones dense there.

74
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,340
So how much of it can you preserve by 
using exercise?

75
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,050
The rest of my body was fine.
In fact,

76
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:34,750
I increased muscle mass,
decreased fat a little bit.

77
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:39,270
My bones were at the same density.
The only place we haven't solved yet is,

78
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,440
is just the hip cradle.
And I think with another iteration or 

79
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,170
two of our exercise equipment,
we'll get that solved and then I'm going

80
00:03:46,171 --> 00:03:47,530
to go to Mars.
Wow.

81
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:52,531
So now,
how long are you when you're doing 

82
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:55,270
exercise to try to build up what 
percentage of your day to doing two 

83
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,300
hours a day?

84
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,340
Every day?
We do one hour of cardiovascular and one

85
00:03:57,341 --> 00:04:02,341
hour of resistive every single day.
Seven days a week for the whole half a 

86
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:05,880
year.
The up there that we've determined 

87
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:05,920
that's the best trade off between 
getting useful work done,

88
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:10,921
you know,
because it's a big multinational 

89
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:11,140
laboratory and keeping your body 
healthy.

90
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,320
So we we commit about two hours a day.
Did they,

91
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,760
when they first started going up there,
did they not do anything?

92
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,740
No.
We've tried a bunch of different things.

93
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,530
The Russians even try to suit.
They call a penguin suit,

94
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:26,610
which is like a set of coveralls,
tight fitting coveralls that's full of 

95
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,440
elastics so that every time you bend 
your elbow or move your twist,

96
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:34,441
your body or something,
you're fighting the resistance of the 

97
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:34,630
suit because they thought then you could
sort of get it for free,

98
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:40,130
but you need to demand it.
You need to actually heavily force your 

99
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,160
body to exercise and if you do that and 
then you can stay in shape,

100
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,510
but we've,
you know,

101
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:48,511
we started out with resistive exercise 
device and that it was the improved I 

102
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,310
read and now we're on a red,
which is the advanced resistive exercise

103
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:52,770
device as we've learned,
you know,

104
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,670
how to make it better so that we,
uh,

105
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,000
we can return to earth healthy or you 
know,

106
00:04:58,001 --> 00:04:59,410
when we go to the moon,
but more importantly,

107
00:04:59,411 --> 00:04:59,770
what we going to.

108
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,630
Maurice Cook takes about half a year to 
get there.

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,430
Well,
we're,

110
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,330
this is one of the problems we need to 
solve the Mars is really that next level

111
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:06,820
trip,
right?

112
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:08,740
Because there's no coming back.
It's,

113
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,260
it's like several levels above where we 
are now.

114
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,100
Station is in orbit around us.
The space station.

115
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:17,410
It's been up there 13 years now with 
people on board.

116
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,820
Um,
but it's like a sailing up and down the 

117
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,700
coast within sight of land.
You know,

118
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,710
we haven't had it across the body of 
water even to go to the moon as far as 

119
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,731
habitation goes.
So right now we're just sailing up and 

120
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:35,050
down the coast of the world figuring out
how to beat osteoporosis.

121
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:37,360
How did the radiation,
the psychology of it,

122
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:42,361
the what to make the whole lot of,
how do you make a toilet that works at 

123
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:42,361
the closed environmental system.

124
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:46,960
Got to invent all those things.
Then I think we'll go to the moon 

125
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,700
because it's the next.
It's only three days away and then we 

126
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:50,980
can do how to use resources that are 
there.

127
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:52,780
How do you generate power?
How do you navigate,

128
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:56,050
how do you do all that?
And then once we got that sorted out,

129
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,970
then I think we'll go further.
But it's still,

130
00:05:59,030 --> 00:05:59,960
you know,
a lot of years away.

131
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,820
What,
what are the big hazards,

132
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:04,940
the big hazards or radiation from space 
micro meteors?

133
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,680
Yup.
And what else?

134
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,760
A psychological.
How do you keep people sane and it's not

135
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:13,820
so bad in the space station because 
we're close to the world.

136
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:18,821
There's only like a two second delay 
talking on the radio so you can have a 

137
00:06:18,821 --> 00:06:19,790
normal conversation.
Just a little pause.

138
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,170
But,
uh,

139
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,570
as soon as you start going to maurice,
within a couple of weeks,

140
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,960
you will never have another conversation
with earth and normal and again,

141
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,990
everything's got so much leg that she'll
just have like recorded video messages 

142
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,120
back and forth.

143
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,240
And so the psych impact of that is going
to be high and the earth will shrink to 

144
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,180
just another star within a couple of 
weeks,

145
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:38,930
you know,
and that,

146
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,250
those people will become Martians in 
mind.

147
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,510
They will no longer be from Earth.
They will see themselves as separate.

148
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,330
When I was on the space station the 
second time,

149
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,810
one of the other crew members,
her name is sue Holmes,

150
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,450
uh,
she and I were talking,

151
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,180
we'd known each other since test pilot 
school.

152
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,390
And in passing a throwaway thing,
she didn't even think she was saying.

153
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:00,050
She said,
hey,

154
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:05,051
you know,
Earth said that we're supposed to do 

155
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:05,051
this next.
And in my mind,

156
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:05,051
not heard,
Earth said,

157
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,010
I heard those words come out of her 
mouth.

158
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:12,130
And it was like she has in her mind,
completely split off from the other 7 

159
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,670
billion people.
There's her crew and earth is one 

160
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,460
singular identifiable entity on the 
other side and that was a real bell 

161
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,870
ringer to me of what it's going to be 
like to go to Maurice.

162
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,870
Those people are going to be a 
completely discrete unit of people and 

163
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:31,570
there'll be Martians.
They won't be earthlinks pretty quick.

164
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,410
Their heads and how do you deal with 
that?

165
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,890
How do we plan for that and it's still a
long ways in the future,

166
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,680
but it's one of the many things we need 
to sort out before we.

167
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Because as you say,
once you get the engines going fast 

168
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:44,800
enough that you're.
You're headed for Mars.

169
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,130
You can't just turn around.
There's no coming back.

170
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:47,720
That's it.
Well,

171
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,670
I mean the Apollo Thirteen,
right?

172
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:54,671
They lost an engine on the way to the 
moon that coasted all the way to the 

173
00:07:54,671 --> 00:07:55,970
moon and they just used like a ball on 
the end of a string.

174
00:07:55,971 --> 00:08:00,971
They just went around the moon with the 
gravity of the moon to sling them back 

175
00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:03,611
at Earth again.
So if something failed on the way to 

176
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:03,611
Mars,
you could do the same thing,

177
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:04,070
but it would take a year.

178
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:09,310
So you know,
no problem can normally last a year to 

179
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:09,440
get resolved.
So pretty much,

180
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:14,441
yeah,
you gotTa have all the problems solved 

181
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:16,031
before you head that way.
And what about like sustainable 

182
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:16,031
resources?
Like as far as like food and things like

183
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:19,040
that,
did they have to when they have to terra

184
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,310
form when they get to Mars and we don't 
know.

185
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:26,660
We're trying to figure all that out.
I'm a really interesting discovery about

186
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,550
three weeks ago.
Curiosity,

187
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:32,360
that big rover that,
that is driving around on Mars right now

188
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:36,830
has some pretty good equipment on it and
it discovered just in the last few weeks

189
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:39,650
that in every cubic foot of dirt on 
Mars,

190
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,990
there's a quart of water.
So there's oceans of water.

191
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:48,710
I mean the topsoil is full of water on 
Mars.

192
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,980
So that's really promising for when we 
get there.

193
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,490
Um,
because water is hydrogen and oxygen and

194
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:56,670
oxygen to breathe hydrogen and oxygen 
mix fuel,

195
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:58,170
hydrogen,
oxygen makes water.

196
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,870
So that's a huge resource.
The moon,

197
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,420
there's water there,
but it's really rare,

198
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:08,450
so that's a big discovery for us 
eventually being able to go there,

199
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,220
but you know,
we need a power source.

200
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,830
The Sun's a long ways away and it's 
dusty on Mars.

201
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,920
You can't just,
you can't have a solar powered 

202
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:18,920
bulldozer,
you know,

203
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,400
you need a power source and we need how 
do you navigate and there's just a 

204
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:28,311
whole,
how do you build a perfect closed loop 

205
00:09:28,311 --> 00:09:30,351
environmental system so that you don't 
have a constant losses and because the 

206
00:09:30,351 --> 00:09:34,401
space station we only.
I think it's about 92 percent of our 

207
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:37,671
water we reclaim,
but we constantly need that little 

208
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:37,950
trickle from earth of new water because 
it's not perfect.

209
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,330
There's,
there's a whole.

210
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:44,390
There's a lot of stuff we did when don't
even know what we don't know yet and 

211
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,840
that's I think why will we'll start a 
lot of that out on the moon.

212
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,910
Before we launched a Mars,
to me,

213
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:52,911
watching the footage of the rover and 
the images that had sent back was almost

214
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:55,200
surreal.
It didn't seem real.

215
00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:00,310
It's hard for me to wrap my head around 
the idea that they sent a robot to 

216
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:05,091
another planet.
It's roaming around taking pictures and 

217
00:10:05,091 --> 00:10:05,091
sending them back and we're looking at 
it.

218
00:10:05,091 --> 00:10:05,580
Yeah,
it's phenomenal.

219
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,120
It's incredible that we could do that 
and and the way that,

220
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:14,270
you know,
Maurice has has just the wrong 

221
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,570
atmosphere.
It's not thick enough to use a parachute

222
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:20,571
in,
but it's not thin enough that you can 

223
00:10:20,571 --> 00:10:20,571
ignore it and just and just slow down 
and land with a rocket.

224
00:10:20,571 --> 00:10:20,600
You know,
it's,

225
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,560
it's,
it's not good for landing.

226
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,930
The Earth's atmosphere is nice and 
thick.

227
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,480
You can come down under a parachute and 
the moon has none,

228
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,870
so you can just like the Apollo guys,
you can just land on your rocket plume.

229
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,150
Maurice,
you're kind of stuck in the middle,

230
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,720
so you need a complex landing system and
curiosity.

231
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:39,450
The way they came up with a solution to 
that was just phenomenal.

232
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:44,451
The big Arrow break through the 
atmosphere and then that sequence of 

233
00:10:44,451 --> 00:10:46,260
miracles and the retro rockets and the 
extendable bridal and everything.

234
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:51,261
It is amazing that that worked and huge 
Kudos to the jpl guys and everybody who 

235
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:55,881
came up with it,
that and the stuff it's teaching us 

236
00:10:55,881 --> 00:10:59,540
about how planets work and what is what 
is the past and the future for that 

237
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,700
planet Mars and therefore gives us a lot
better understanding of what's normal 

238
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:04,830
and what,
what,

239
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,190
what can we can expect on earth.
A huge Kudos to those people.

240
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:08,830
Indeed.
I mean,

241
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,660
they did an amazing,
amazing thing and just one of those,

242
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:17,661
in my opinion,
one of those paradigm shifting moments 

243
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:18,720
where when we're back here on earth and 
we're watching those images,

244
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:19,380
you're like,
wow,

245
00:11:19,381 --> 00:11:22,260
they can do this now I'm,
I'm an astronaut,

246
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:27,470
an astronaut and you know,
I've been in space twice and I gathered 

247
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,560
my family around to watch that thing 
happened because it's so.

248
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,680
It is right on the edge of what we can 
just barely do.

249
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:36,280
It's such a brave thing to do and such a
capable probe,

250
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:40,260
a capable extension of assault to put 
down on the surface and it's teaching us

251
00:11:40,261 --> 00:11:45,261
about Mars.
Did you ever pay any attention to the 

252
00:11:45,261 --> 00:11:45,261
face on Mars or any of that?
Crazy.

253
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,380
That's all fun.
And,

254
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:47,250
and you know,
there's,

255
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,840
there's faces all over.
I mean,

256
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,470
just lay on your back and look at the 
clouds.

257
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,050
There's faces everywhere,
right?

258
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,430
That's sure.
We naturally look for faces,

259
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,750
especially in weird shadowy images.
Those images were mean.

260
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,760
There were some really unique things.
There's a rock near my house that's a 

261
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,810
square rock and when I have a friend who
believes in a lot of conspiracy theories

262
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:07,960
and he believes in the face on Mars and 
a lot of different stuff,

263
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,280
and I said,
I'm going to show you something,

264
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:10,000
man.
Come over here.

265
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:10,840
I go,
look at that rock.

266
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,720
Do you think anybody made that rock?
That rock has just made.

267
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:15,580
That's just a rock amongst the pile of 
rocks.

268
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:18,520
It's big and it's kind of square.
Not Perfectly Square,

269
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,000
but if you looked at a blurry picture of
it that was taken from space,

270
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:24,550
you would swear this is the building 
block for a paramed.

271
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:29,580
Obviously,
she's clearly made by an intelligent 

272
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:29,580
species.
Same one that built the pyramids.

273
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:29,580
Yeah,
I know.

274
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:34,411
It's,
it's always easier to believe something 

275
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:34,411
than it is to understand it.

276
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:39,570
Yeah.
The fascinating thing about the face on 

277
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,570
Mars is not that it looks like a face on
Mars.

278
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,810
It's the idea that Mars at one point in 
time actually could have sustained some 

279
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:46,840
form of life.
In fact,

280
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,650
definitely did.
It had an atmosphere that was livable at

281
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:52,390
one point in time.
They really.

282
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:57,391
There could've been some kind of life.
Maybe it was just like microbes or 

283
00:12:57,391 --> 00:12:59,290
plants or might still is the biggest 
volcano in the solar system,

284
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,380
so it has heat and it has all this 
water,

285
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,950
but we've just found now for sure and 
heat and water on earth always means 

286
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:11,050
life to me and just look under your sink
and so on.

287
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,810
On Mars.
Maybe there's a fossil record of it.

288
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,820
Maybe there's even something still 
primitive stuff living somewhere in the 

289
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:18,970
rock we don't know,
but we haven't found any yet,

290
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,470
but if we can find that on Mars and we 
know this life on earth and there's life

291
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:28,471
everywhere and that would be a pretty 
important thing to figure out or the 

292
00:13:28,471 --> 00:13:31,621
possibility that life actually started 
on Mars and some sort of an impact from 

293
00:13:31,621 --> 00:13:34,470
an asteroid panspermia senate hurling 
towards birth.

294
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,990
I'm not sure that's a logical 
conclusion.

295
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:38,410
You know,
if,

296
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,130
if life can start somewhere,
then it can start in two places.

297
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,280
Right.
And so it doesn't have to miraculously 

298
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,711
be Panspermia from one planet to another
if it formed on Mars than and there's 

299
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:53,941
life on earth and it's a more logical 
conclusion to think that it just formed 

300
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:54,980
in two places I think.
Do you,

301
00:13:54,981 --> 00:13:59,981
when you,
when you sit in that space station and 

302
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:03,181
you're floating above earth much as you 
were saying that your colleague started 

303
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:06,901
referring to Earth as a separate 
individual entity and you guys were 

304
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:10,741
separate from Earth.
Did you look out when you're looking at 

305
00:14:10,741 --> 00:14:14,380
the vastness of everything?
I mean it's just everything.

306
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:19,150
And Dee dee did feel like earth was in a
neighborhood more like,

307
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,850
you know what I mean?
That we weren't isolated.

308
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:24,880
That where it's so silly.
The thing is so big.

309
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,120
Did you feel like more connected to the 
rest of the universe in any sort of a 

310
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,531
way?
Joe And you're in the side of the 

311
00:14:33,531 --> 00:14:36,421
spaceship and you look at the world,
you're looking at it through the 

312
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:36,520
windows.
And I came back,

313
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:41,930
it was so funny.
I came back from my first space flight 

314
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:42,160
and was sitting in the living room with 
my wife Halena and we were watching star

315
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:45,970
trek and they show that scene with Sulu 
and whoever upfront and there's the,

316
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,120
there were in the standard orbit,
Mr Sulo and there's the curve of the 

317
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,120
earth underneath.
And I remember going,

318
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,070
that's it.
That's exactly what

319
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,600
it looks like.
They got that right.

320
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,790
They guessed right in 1968 or whatever 
it was.

321
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,830
Because when you're inside the 
spaceship,

322
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,250
it looks like that.
The difference is when you go outside 

323
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,120
and then um,
you are,

324
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,520
it's like the difference between sitting
in your living room,

325
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:09,590
looking outside and hanging on a cliff 
or you know,

326
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:14,591
hanging on half dome or somewhere where 
it's an entirely different perspective 

327
00:15:14,591 --> 00:15:15,290
even though it may look at the same 
thing.

328
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:20,000
Being outside is a,
is so immersive.

329
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,180
The world is no longer nicely underneath
you,

330
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:24,800
like dark,
like Sulu,

331
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,320
but it is,
it is this huge hanging,

332
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,380
a spinning mass next to you and the 
universe is what's around you and you 

333
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,040
are,
you are part of it.

334
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:39,041
You're suspended in it.
It's that we aren't used to have in the 

335
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:39,041
universe,
under our feet,

336
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,220
on all around us and,
and feeling that you're in it not just 

337
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,370
sort of blow it,
looking up at it and that is really 

338
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:51,401
different and that's when you really see
that the world is just in the 

339
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:55,331
neighborhood and that it is a ball with 
the moon being a ball in the son's over 

340
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:55,550
there.

341
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,050
And if we go up there,
that's Maurice.

342
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,460
You really get that feeling when you're 
out on a space walk.

343
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:04,850
I've heard several astronauts talk about
that feeling and that that moment when 

344
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,501
they are outside of the spacecraft and 
looking at the universe itself and 

345
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,410
saying that it changed them forever.

346
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:16,590
Uh,
it gave me a profound respect and also 

347
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,690
I'm,
I don't even know.

348
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,210
I mean nobody knows the answer,
right?

349
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:25,520
Big Bang and all the rest of it and all 
the,

350
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,780
all the belief systems around the world 
and how everybody deals with all that.

351
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,760
And I sure don't know the answer to 
that,

352
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:33,290
but when you look at the world,
it's,

353
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,080
it's really hard to convince yourself 
that it's random.

354
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,800
Just looking at it,
it's like how can that possibly be?

355
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,500
But then again,
if you look a little further out,

356
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,320
there's,
you know,

357
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,910
how could maurice be random and how 
could all the other planets,

358
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:51,911
how could Saturn,
the way it looks to be just a random 

359
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:51,911
event.
And,

360
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:51,911
and,
uh,

361
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:56,560
the unlimited number of stars that are 
out there and the planets we're seeing 

362
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,160
around other stars directly.
I don't know how to resolve it.

363
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,300
In my mind,
I didn't,

364
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,760
I didn't,
uh,

365
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,560
find the meaning of it all.
Like being on a spacewalk,

366
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:08,590
if anything,
it just deepened my dumb foundedness at 

367
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:08,590
the,
uh,

368
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:12,050
at the immensity of it in our tiny 
little part of it.

369
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:17,270
Yeah.
I've often thought that questions 

370
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,400
pondering questions like the randomness 
of the universe or the,

371
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:22,610
just the reality that we know about 
subatomic particles and the idea of the 

372
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:26,670
universe being this fractal thing and 
impossible and never ending.

373
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,570
I think it's almost like walking up to a
mountain and going,

374
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:32,580
yeah,
I could see how that could be picked up,

375
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,800
but you can't really pick it up 
yourself.

376
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:35,640
So you're just like,
man,

377
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:38,010
I guess.
I guess it could be random.

378
00:17:38,011 --> 00:17:43,011
I don't know what I don't understand.
I don't even know what the fuck random 

379
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:46,791
means.
The idea of random seems the universe 

380
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,671
itself seems to be this incredibly 
complex thing has not just laws but very

381
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,320
clear directions that things move into.
It constantly is complexifying from the 

382
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,360
big bang till now.
And the idea of black holes,

383
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:05,361
the eating matter and creating a 
singularity and that possibly these new,

384
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,580
these new astrophysicists and string 
theorist guys are saying that they think

385
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:16,080
that inside every black home may in fact
be a completely different universe.

386
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,600
You know on the top of the space 
station,

387
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:23,601
we have a experiment put there by a 
Nobel prize winning physicist named Sam 

388
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,180
Ting and it's from cern,
from the big particle accelerator that's

389
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:31,110
under.
I'm Switzerland and France to their baby

390
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,320
and it's up there.
It's a huge magnet and what it's doing 

391
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,210
is collecting subatomic particles of the
universe and it's.

392
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,520
It's got layer after layer of detector 
so I can try and figure out what they 

393
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,841
all are as they come ripping through and
it's collected trillions and trillions 

394
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:51,141
of them.
It's been up there for the last couple 

395
00:18:51,141 --> 00:18:51,900
of years and the reason is we don't know
what the universe is made of.

396
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,200
We can only account for five percent of 
the universe with the known particles 

397
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,311
that we have five.
We don't know what 95 percent of the 

398
00:19:01,311 --> 00:19:04,551
universities even made of.
And so we call it dark energy and dark 

399
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:08,391
matter,
and we're trying to indirectly prove 

400
00:19:08,391 --> 00:19:11,450
that those exist based on the 
proportions of the subatomic particles 

401
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,480
were collecting up in the top of the 
space station and it's a decade,

402
00:19:13,481 --> 00:19:16,650
a long project,
and they released the first layer of the

403
00:19:16,651 --> 00:19:19,830
results back in the spring and it's 
starting to look like,

404
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,540
like maybe some of the theories are 
correct,

405
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,940
but we're,
you know,

406
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,120
we've talked as if were were 
conclusively brilliant and we understand

407
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:27,510
everything.

408
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,660
I mean we're still calling things dark 
matter and dark energy.

409
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:32,790
We have no idea.
I'm just trying to figure it out.

410
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,530
That's another word for magic.
It is indeed.

411
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:37,330
It's another word for,
I don't know.

412
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:37,680
Well,
it's,

413
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:42,800
we,
we are most certainly the smartest and 

414
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,170
the most informed human beings that have
ever existed as far as we know,

415
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,330
the two of us.
No,

416
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,520
no.
Denying me 100 percent.

417
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,610
I'm not an idiot.
But as far as like humans that have ever

418
00:19:51,611 --> 00:19:55,030
lived where the the most informed the 
most technologically capable,

419
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,630
but much like when we look back at the 
renaissance era,

420
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:03,631
or we'll look back at Galileo being in 
prison because he dared question the 

421
00:20:03,631 --> 00:20:05,200
idea that the earth wasn't the center of
the universe.

422
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,680
We're going to make fun of us some day.
They're going to make fun of us like 

423
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,770
these dummies.
They didn't know what Clark was glue on.

424
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:16,771
Plasma was.
They had to use a particle accelerator 

425
00:20:16,771 --> 00:20:17,020
to prove that the Higgs Boson existed.
Yeah,

426
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,820
I agree.
We're going to look at the space shuttle

427
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:20,730
and go.
What were they thinking?

428
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,250
I'm at station wagon.
I think it's just so ridiculous.

429
00:20:24,251 --> 00:20:25,750
Like a DC three now.
You know.

430
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,020
That's one thing I really wanted to 
bring up with you.

431
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,030
You know,
you,

432
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:34,150
you had to take one of those up there.
You have to take some sort of a 

433
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,400
spaceship up there.
What is the feeling like of good?

434
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,680
Did you have to get an,
a Russian one?

435
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:44,150
My first two flights were on shuttles.
I flew Atlantis and then endeavor and 

436
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,420
then my third flight I was left seat,
so sorta like the pilot of the Soyuz,

437
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,130
so I flown them.
Wow.

438
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:53,340
So you flew when the space shuttle was 
in operation and you flew the Russian 

439
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:56,440
version of the space shuttle.
What's the difference?

440
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,460
The shuttle is is so much more capable.
It is the most capable flying machine 

441
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:05,110
humans have ever built.
Unbelievable.

442
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,710
And three quarters of everybody who's 
ever flown in space flew on the shuttle.

443
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:13,711
It was the first great lifter.
It's purpose was to take a huge spy 

444
00:21:14,711 --> 00:21:19,711
satellite up.
This was the conception of the sixties 

445
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:19,711
and early seventies.
Take the best technology.

446
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:22,300
60 spy satellite launch out of 
Vandenberg.

447
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:24,460
Go straight north,
go halfway around the world,

448
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,260
take pictures of the hot spots of the 
world,

449
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,440
come back again,
and then use the wings to be able to go 

450
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,981
sort of sideways and side slip because 
the world's turned underneath you and 

451
00:21:34,981 --> 00:21:35,890
come back and land again after one 
orbit.

452
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:41,250
That's why we had wings on the shuttle 
was so that we could carry this huge 

453
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,130
telescope and they weren't automated 
back then,

454
00:21:42,131 --> 00:21:44,410
so we needed a crew to be able to 
operate the telescope.

455
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:49,830
That's why the payload bay was the size 
that it was and why the shuttle could 

456
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,030
lift the amount that it could lift.
It was to meet all those requirements.

457
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:57,100
That all immediately stopped being the 
reason for the space shuttle to exist,

458
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:02,310
but the design was already set.
What that gave us though was a vehicle 

459
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,040
that could carry,
gosh,

460
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:06,670
40 or 50,000
pounds up in a payload bay that's a size

461
00:22:06,671 --> 00:22:11,671
of a city bus and then bring it back and
land it gently on a runway and carry a 

462
00:22:11,671 --> 00:22:16,351
crew up to seven.
So is like a space station all on its 

463
00:22:16,351 --> 00:22:19,970
own and amazingly capable vehicle.
Amazingly complex too.

464
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:25,030
And when things are amazingly complex,
they're really expensive and hard to 

465
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,580
operate safely and we lost two crews,
you know,

466
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:31,590
as a result of the complexity of it.
The Soyuz is designed to take three 

467
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:36,940
people and a tiny bit of gear up to the 
space station doc.

468
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:42,030
Stay there for half a year or longer as 
their lifeboat and then at the end of 

469
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,240
time get back in and come back home 
again.

470
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,710
That's the uses purpose and it does that
really well,

471
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,860
but it's tiny and very purpose built.
The two of them are magnificent 

472
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,300
vehicles,
but built for way different purposes and

473
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:58,660
both very carefully evolved to do what 
they do.

474
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:59,580
Um,
you know,

475
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,290
exquisitely well.
Um,

476
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,460
and I,
I'm lucky to have flown on both.

477
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,520
That sounds so incredible.
Yeah.

478
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,940
What is the g force field like when you 
take an off from the,

479
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:14,040
the launchpad you go straight up.
Of course you have to get above the air.

480
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,430
Um,
if,

481
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,580
if you want to stay in orbit,
you got to go five miles a second.

482
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,560
If you're going a little slower,
it's,

483
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,890
it's sort of like throwing something 
sideways.

484
00:23:23,891 --> 00:23:28,360
It gravity pulls it down.
But if you can throw it sideways at five

485
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:31,090
miles a second,
then gravity will still pull it down.

486
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:34,420
But the earth curves away underneath it.
If it's going fast enough,

487
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:34,860
you know,
it's like,

488
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:39,870
goes over the horizon before it falls.
So that's how we stay at orbit is we go 

489
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:44,881
five miles a second,
but you can't go five miles second in 

490
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:44,881
the air,
the frictions just too high.

491
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:48,890
So the rocket ships take you straight up
to get you above the air.

492
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,160
And that takes about two minutes going 
straight up and in 45 seconds here 

493
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,330
through the speed of sound,
straight up and accelerating.

494
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:01,330
And in 70 seconds you're through the 
altitude and speed of the concord 

495
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:01,330
accelerating,
straight up.

496
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,800
And after two minutes here,
about 160,000

497
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:07,610
feet and six times the speed of sound,
but you're above almost all of the air.

498
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:11,960
And then your first stage falls off.
So inside it's this,

499
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:16,910
it's this incredibly powerful push in 
your back like a dragster.

500
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,310
But like one that's,
that's gone off the road,

501
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:21,140
the vibration of,
of uh,

502
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,550
pushing through the air,
that's,

503
00:24:22,551 --> 00:24:27,551
it's a,
it's like a tuning fork kind of 

504
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:29,831
vibration.
This enormous powerful jaws of a dog 

505
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:33,380
kind of ride straight up.
But then after two minutes,

506
00:24:33,381 --> 00:24:36,570
the solids are the,
the stage that got you above the air,

507
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:41,620
all out of fuel.
It explodes off because you don't want 

508
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:41,620
to carry all that dead weight with you 
anymore.

509
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:46,930
And then you use the remaining engines 
for the next six minutes or six and a 

510
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:50,150
half to accelerate out horizontal 
basically to five miles a second.

511
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,180
And uh,
and so for the last six minutes,

512
00:24:53,181 --> 00:24:55,910
it's like a long liquid drive,
heavy,

513
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:59,600
steady pushing someone with their fist 
in your back,

514
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,610
pushing you faster and faster and 
faster,

515
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,740
smoother ride because you're above the 
ear.

516
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,270
And after just under nine minutes,
like eight,

517
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,490
eight,
45 or so,

518
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,270
you're exactly the right place,
the right direction,

519
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,550
and the right speed,
the engine shut off.

520
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,230
And you're in space and you're 
weightless.

521
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,110
So it's nine minutes.
Yep.

522
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,930
It's 8:42
on the shuttle and just under nine,

523
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,360
like 8:55
for the Soyuz.

524
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,820
What's the maximum g force you 
experienced during that?

525
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,130
Uh,
the shuttles about three g.

526
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:33,220
and in fact,
when you hit three g with the throttle 

527
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,231
start coming back,
because it was only built for about 

528
00:25:35,231 --> 00:25:35,231
three and a half g.
So three times your normal weights.

529
00:25:35,231 --> 00:25:36,740
If he weighed 200 pounds,
you weigh 600 pounds in there.

530
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,680
The so use is about four or four and a 
half.

531
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,720
So if you're 200 pounds a year up 
around,

532
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,320
you know,
eight,

533
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:47,350
900 pounds.
I got a ride with the blue angels and 

534
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,970
whether those f eighteens ones,
I was nfat pilot for a lot of years.

535
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,010
Those are incredible.
That's a great airplane.

536
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,430
You got to fly those.
Yeah.

537
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,130
What's the most jeezy pulled in the 
moment?

538
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:01,180
One of those things.
If you take an f 18 and you grabbed the 

539
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:01,890
stick and you snap it into your lap,
um,

540
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,330
you aren't actually connected to 
anything except a computer.

541
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,460
It's little sensors.
It's fly by wire.

542
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,520
So it says wow,
he wants to turn right now.

543
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,090
And so then it moves all the control 
surfaces of the airplane,

544
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,920
but it doesn't want to break the wings 
off.

545
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,380
So it will limit you.
It's,

546
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:22,410
it's the airplane limits,
the amount of Ge that it can pull and 

547
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,720
it'll give you about eight g about age.

548
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,520
That's all it will give you because 
otherwise you could structurally damaged

549
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,020
the airplane.
So there was a paddle,

550
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,880
you could actually,
if you are going to hit the ground,

551
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:37,210
you could hit this paddle that would 
override the g control system and snap 

552
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:40,421
it in your lap and just give you 
whatever the aerodynamics would give 

553
00:26:40,421 --> 00:26:41,990
you.
We've had people pull 12 g but uh,

554
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:47,500
but the Soyuz,
if you come into the atmosphere the 

555
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,360
wrong way,
can pull 20 or 22 g on the way home,

556
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,070
which is just,
just wicked.

557
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:55,071
And that happened once in the Russian 
experience live that you're lying down 

558
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,380
when you're in fat.
And like when you flew with the Blue 

559
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:00,380
Angels,
you're sitting upright.

560
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,270
So when you pull back,
it pushes the g,

561
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:07,350
the blood down to your feet.
So the real limitation is how much of 

562
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,250
that can you stand before you can't.

563
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:13,410
You can't stay awake for your blackout 
in a Soyuz we're actually laying on her 

564
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,690
back so the blood doesn't drain out of 
your head.

565
00:27:15,691 --> 00:27:17,610
It just gets kind of pushed to the back 
of your body.

566
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,880
So therefore you can survive it.
It won't block you out,

567
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,550
it doesn't damage you.
It's,

568
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:26,250
it's sorta like a prolonged car crash,
you know,

569
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,280
people pull 20 g in a car crash,
but it's instantaneous if you fall into 

570
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,950
the atmosphere the wrong way in a Soyuz.
Then as you hit the thick atmosphere,

571
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:40,070
it's almost like crashing into something
super high gp for maybe 30 seconds and 

572
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:43,620
then then you come through that gp can 
slow down and it's survivable.

573
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:45,540
But I wouldn't want to write it.

574
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,270
That feeling must be just incredible.
What,

575
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,660
what are the thoughts that are going 
through your mind when you're,

576
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:54,510
when you're going that fast shooting up 
in this space.

577
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:55,640
I,
uh,

578
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,450
it was funny.
You know,

579
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,460
I'm focusing on the job because there's 
a million things that can fail and one 

580
00:28:03,651 --> 00:28:07,190
of the mantras of astronauts is there is
no problem so bad that you can't make it

581
00:28:07,191 --> 00:28:10,220
worse.
So we think of it that all the time.

582
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:15,550
And so we,
we really are careful in the way up and 

583
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:15,550
so a big part of you is involved with 
that,

584
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,720
but another part of you is just,
is just loving the ride so much.

585
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:24,530
And I found after a while that my cheeks
were hurting and I was like,

586
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,960
why is my face hurt?
And I realized because this smile,

587
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:31,961
this big stupid smile on my face,
so much of my cheeks were cramping up 

588
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:35,000
because it was so much of a thrill.
That's an amazing.

589
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,930
Yeah.
It was like heaven.

590
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:36,780
You know,
one one,

591
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:41,830
those two people on your shoulders,
one that's being all serious in one 

592
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,411
that's yelling bad advice to you.
The one that's having a good time is 

593
00:28:44,411 --> 00:28:44,411
just going ahead.

594
00:28:44,411 --> 00:28:46,870
I just love on the ride.
It is so much fun.

595
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,610
Guess that's a good time to do that,
right?

596
00:28:48,611 --> 00:28:50,940
Because you're completely helpless.
Actually.

597
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,970
Joy.
Helpless

598
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,170
at all.
Yeah.

599
00:28:53,171 --> 00:28:53,650
You're,
you're,

600
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,860
there's all sorts of stuff that you're 
responsible for on the way up in the way

601
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:59,320
down.
And even in the is when you lying down.

602
00:28:59,340 --> 00:28:59,930
Oh,
in the suite.

603
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,710
What do you have?
Full control panel and there's stuff you

604
00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:04,790
have to do or you have to do as it's 
happening.

605
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:05,830
Oh yeah.
What do you do?

606
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:06,350
Why,
why?

607
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,200
While you're flying,
if everything works perfectly,

608
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,090
we're just watching.
And,

609
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,710
and same in the shuttle.
We have very,

610
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,660
you know,
hopefully don't have to do anything,

611
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:18,750
but sometimes things don't go right and 
then you got a bunch of things you can 

612
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:18,750
do,
you know,

613
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,580
various shutdowns in a board,
certain people probably don't know,

614
00:29:21,581 --> 00:29:22,450
but,
uh,

615
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,700
the shuttle as it launched up the east 
coast of theu ,

616
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,570
s,
uh,

617
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,540
we kept abort landing runways all the 
way up to coast.

618
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,700
You could land at Cherry point or can 
land in New York,

619
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,980
you could land in Newfoundland or all 
those places.

620
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:36,070
And so as you're ticket up the coast,
you're constantly going,

621
00:29:36,071 --> 00:29:37,030
okay,
if we have a failure,

622
00:29:37,031 --> 00:29:42,031
now we're going to abort this way.
We're going to turn around and land in 

623
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:42,031
Bermuda.
We're going to land here,

624
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:44,070
we're going to land.
And you practice those like crazy.

625
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:49,110
Then you get to a certain point and then
you would land in North Africa or South 

626
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,920
France or in Spain and all those 
windows,

627
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:52,810
all those tick points,
all those,

628
00:29:52,811 --> 00:29:53,650
uh,
thresholds.

629
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:55,840
You have to get your word.
That's what we're hyper aware of.

630
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:57,550
We're not,
we're not along for the ride.

631
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,280
Wow.
So while this is all going on,

632
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:03,070
you have these big giant smile and you 
still are calculating.

633
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,320
Oh yeah.
You still going?

634
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,700
Okay.
If it screws up now I go here.

635
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:11,730
Oh yeah.
I run into my thumb down a long list of 

636
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:11,830
all the various wickets that you're 
jumping through.

637
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,060
Yeah.
You pay attention.

638
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,830
How much of the trip is automated?
How much of it is manual?

639
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:23,560
Uh,
we'd like it to be as automated as 

640
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:23,560
possible because,
uh,

641
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,030
if it's,
if that means things are predictable and

642
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:28,570
things didn't break and for the vast 
majority of shuttle flights.

643
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:31,000
And so he was flights,
it's automated,

644
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:36,690
but sometimes it's not.
I'm on the way up hill and we've had 

645
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:40,801
engines fail or engine start to fail,
had to shut engines down and go to 

646
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:40,801
backup or at least,
uh,

647
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:43,630
a reserve,
a configuration of the engines.

648
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,460
You get the launch.
Yeah.

649
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,350
During lunch that happened at a couple 
of shots.

650
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,670
It happened on Apollo as well on the way
back to Earth.

651
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:57,010
Uh,
we've had serious problems with the 

652
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:57,010
Soyuz where,
uh,

653
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,780
you have to take over and try and fly 
manually or come in ballistically,

654
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,650
which means it loses its ability to 
steer on the way home and you just start

655
00:31:02,651 --> 00:31:04,780
spinning the vehicle and then it just 
comes in like,

656
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,040
like a pure media,
right?

657
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,610
And you pull about eight or nine g on a 
ballistic entry and that's,

658
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,660
uh,
that's,

659
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:14,290
that's pretty tough after six months of 
weightlessness to suddenly,

660
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:18,370
if you're a 200 now a 1600 or 1700 
pounds.

661
00:31:18,371 --> 00:31:19,080
And that's,
that's,

662
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,320
that's pretty hard on the body.
Wow.

663
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:26,550
It's incredible the feeling that you 
must have had when you actually stepped 

664
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,920
onto ground again.
What was that like?

665
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,010
It's awful.
It's awful.

666
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,570
You're,
you're so nauseous and dizzy.

667
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,040
And,
and,

668
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:39,310
um,
the reason is of course,

669
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,860
a,
your vision is telling you one thing,

670
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,530
telling you where the horizon is,
where up is,

671
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:50,010
but your inner ear,
which normally when your eyes are 

672
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:50,010
closed,
keeps you from falling over.

673
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:54,151
You know,
you can close your eyes and not fall 

674
00:31:54,151 --> 00:31:54,151
over.
That has forgotten completely what to do

675
00:31:54,151 --> 00:31:55,990
with gravity because you've been 
weightless first,

676
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,280
whatever,
five or six months.

677
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:03,120
So now you have this sudden great 
violent disagreement between what your 

678
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,150
eyes are saying and what your inner ear 
is saying.

679
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:07,870
It's like if you spend 50 times and then
stop spinning and you stagger around,

680
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,720
so your body says,
oh,

681
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:15,780
there is something seriously wrong.
Why is his vision so wildly different 

682
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,970
than his inner ear?
And for the last million years,

683
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,930
one of the probable cause is was you ate
something poisonous.

684
00:32:22,931 --> 00:32:27,931
You ate some sort of neurotoxin or 
something that is messing up your 

685
00:32:27,931 --> 00:32:31,561
internal systems and it might kill you.
So the first thing your body makes you 

686
00:32:31,561 --> 00:32:34,240
want to do is throw up because it's 
trying to get rid of whatever it was you

687
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:39,241
just ate.
And then the next thing your body makes 

688
00:32:39,241 --> 00:32:39,241
me want to do is go lay down and go to 
sleep.

689
00:32:39,241 --> 00:32:39,920
Stopped it,
right?

690
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:43,580
It's trying to keep you alive.
So when you first get back from space,

691
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:48,020
your body's just screaming at you to 
throw up and glide down.

692
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,070
But,
uh,

693
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:54,100
you know,
you got all this stuff to do and people 

694
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,111
were there to meet you and um,
and you're trying to just ignore those 

695
00:32:56,111 --> 00:32:56,510
symptoms and,
and pay attention to what,

696
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,500
you know,
what's going on.

697
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:01,110
Is there a happiness along with that?
I mean,

698
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,880
is there a feeling of being home?

699
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,180
Oh yeah,
yeah,

700
00:33:04,181 --> 00:33:09,181
all three of my flights and,
and if the flight went well and we work 

701
00:33:09,181 --> 00:33:12,871
hard enough that they almost always do,
there's a great sense of satisfaction 

702
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:17,140
because we just,
it's like the final step in an extremely

703
00:33:17,141 --> 00:33:22,141
complicated process where you have done 
everything right or enough things right 

704
00:33:22,141 --> 00:33:22,180
that,
uh,

705
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:27,560
that you can,
you can like Kinda have that for the 

706
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:27,560
rest of your life.
So there's a,

707
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,340
there's a tremendous feeling of,
of joy and pride and accomplishment.

708
00:33:31,421 --> 00:33:32,590
And when you get back to Earth,

709
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:38,190
I have always been fascinated by space 
and if you look up you can see the 

710
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,070
lights here are covered with sudden I 
like,

711
00:33:39,071 --> 00:33:41,180
I like your lights stars good.
Um,

712
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:46,740
but what,
what drives me nuts is how little we 

713
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,970
actually get to see of the stars because
of light pollution.

714
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,960
I was a at the big island and I went to 
the Keck observatory.

715
00:33:52,961 --> 00:33:54,400
Yep.
And there's the,

716
00:33:54,401 --> 00:33:57,880
uh,
there's a station where the telescope is

717
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,280
and then below that at like 9,000
feet.

718
00:34:00,281 --> 00:34:02,170
There's like this visitor station.
Have you been?

719
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,310
Uh,
I've been near there.

720
00:34:03,311 --> 00:34:08,311
I put up at the top of a couple of the 
mountains there to have a look at the 

721
00:34:08,311 --> 00:34:08,311
sky.
It's in incredible.

722
00:34:08,311 --> 00:34:08,950
It's,
we,

723
00:34:08,951 --> 00:34:09,590
I was,
I was,

724
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:12,700
when we were driving up there,
I was worried that it was too cloudy.

725
00:34:12,701 --> 00:34:13,180
I was like,
oh,

726
00:34:13,181 --> 00:34:14,980
this is going to be terrible,
you know,

727
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,590
we wanted to go and see the stars and we
picked a cloudy night,

728
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,510
but we drove through the clouds.

729
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:23,740
And then when you get above there and 
you realize that the entire big island,

730
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:28,780
they have special diffused lighting to 
make sure that they don't emit light 

731
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,340
pollution.
The view is life changing.

732
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:35,490
It must be like one,
1000000th of what you experience on the 

733
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:40,200
space station.
But for me it was a real life changing 

734
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,291
moment.
I'll never forget it and I'll think 

735
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:43,291
about it all the time.
Whenever I look at the stars,

736
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,160
I always think about that night in 
Hawaii,

737
00:34:45,161 --> 00:34:46,260
that's what it looks like,
but,

738
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,420
but even crazier,
there's a.

739
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:53,460
there's an image of it up there,
but even crazier when you're actually 

740
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,060
experiencing and you could see the Milky
Way,

741
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,710
and I remember thinking,
God,

742
00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:01,950
we have to figure out a way to stop 
light pollution because I think just 

743
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:05,791
that,
just being able to look up and see that 

744
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:08,550
would change people's perceptions and 
would probably make people way more 

745
00:35:08,561 --> 00:35:10,240
enthusiastic about space.

746
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:15,700
People know,
of course the vast majority of people 

747
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:15,870
live in cities and the places that have 
the worst light pollution of the city.

748
00:35:15,871 --> 00:35:18,500
So I had a similar experience to yours 
when I was in fat pilot.

749
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:22,910
I would get it up to high altitude.
I'm going on a cross country,

750
00:35:22,911 --> 00:35:27,911
especially in the north,
put on the autopilot and it's shut off 

751
00:35:27,911 --> 00:35:28,100
every light in the cockpit and let my 
eyes adjust.

752
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,290
And you're already up at 40,
45,000

753
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:35,291
feet and so there's almost no atmosphere
above you and you could see the texture 

754
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:37,440
of space.
You can see the Milky Way.

755
00:35:37,441 --> 00:35:39,330
You can see why it's called the Milky 
Way.

756
00:35:39,331 --> 00:35:40,290
I mean,
it's a,

757
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,200
it's a white,
gray,

758
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,950
white part of the sky,
you know,

759
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,660
and you don't need a telescope to see 
it.

760
00:35:45,661 --> 00:35:50,661
You can just see it with your eyes.
You don't need some special time lapse 

761
00:35:50,661 --> 00:35:50,661
photography.

762
00:35:50,661 --> 00:35:50,790
So,
uh,

763
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:51,390
it,
it,

764
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,270
it,
it's both humbling and uh,

765
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,820
and really inspiring I think to see,
puts everything into perspective,

766
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:05,330
but I don't know,
even if you're trying to work on light 

767
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,581
pollution,
people are indoor creatures and cities 

768
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:10,281
and they have street lights and they 
drive around in cars and I don't know 

769
00:36:10,281 --> 00:36:13,410
how you get people to notice the 
universe around them.

770
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:18,180
I think it would help if they could just
see it start.

771
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:19,980
If you look up in Los Angeles,
ca,

772
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,960
what do you see?
You see a star.

773
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,060
I lived in Houston for a long time and 
yeah,

774
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,890
I look at that.
I can see 18 stairs tonight.

775
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:27,660
It's a real clear night,
barely.

776
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:33,110
But when you're up there and the,
and the observatory and I'm sure when 

777
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:33,110
you were at 40,000
feet in the jet,

778
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,970
it must have been amazing.
Yeah,

779
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:35,560
it's,
it,

780
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,160
uh,
it's not that much further away.

781
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:38,870
I mean,
uh,

782
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,040
the big island mountain is not all that 
high,

783
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:46,220
but you just need one sometimes one 
small step and you can see a whole new 

784
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:46,220
thing.
Yeah.

785
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:50,931
I had some similar but not quite as 
intense viewings in the mountains above 

786
00:36:51,181 --> 00:36:52,170
boulder,
Colorado.

787
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:54,120
So like at 8,500
feet up there,

788
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:59,121
it was beautiful too.
But I think that we forget that we're 

789
00:36:59,121 --> 00:37:03,321
really in space.
It's as stupid as that sounds really do 

790
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:07,041
forget.
So I was going around the world and my 

791
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:07,950
son who ran the social media for the 
flight to a large degree,

792
00:37:07,951 --> 00:37:09,120
send me a note saying,
Hey dad,

793
00:37:09,121 --> 00:37:11,400
Mt.
Etna is erupting in southern Italy,

794
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,590
have a look of Mount Etna.
So I'm a good dad.

795
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:18,710
Took a picture of how Aetna,
but I'm seeing the superheated lava and 

796
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:21,930
the smoke and the steam coming out of 
the earth,

797
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,240
uh,
was a really,

798
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:27,030
especially when you're looking at the 
world as a ball,

799
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:32,150
was a really clear reminder of the fact 
that most of the planet is super heated 

800
00:37:32,611 --> 00:37:37,611
lava and magma and where it's so hot 
that the rock is liquid and plastic 

801
00:37:37,611 --> 00:37:42,000
right then and we just live on this 
little chilled crust like,

802
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,130
like the top of a porridge pot,
you know,

803
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:47,370
and we just live on this little thin bit
at the top that is crossed.

804
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:52,140
And when you tip it the other way around
and look up half of the atmosphere is in

805
00:37:52,141 --> 00:37:54,810
the first three miles,
three miles,

806
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:59,811
you know,
think about why people go for a three 

807
00:37:59,811 --> 00:37:59,811
mile run.
You know,

808
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:02,520
that and half really the whole habitable
atmosphere is three miles above 15,000

809
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:03,630
feet.
It's hard to even live.

810
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,990
And we live in beats on this little bit 
of cooled crust and this little sliver 

811
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,640
of air.
And we think it's guaranteed.

812
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,740
We think we think we're invincible,
right?

813
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:17,040
And we think the whole universe is here 
to serve us and we're like,

814
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,690
we're like bacteria in a corner,
you know,

815
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,370
just just found a little niche that will
support our life.

816
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:28,580
So much so that we're willing to almost 
our entire system as far as energy is 

817
00:38:29,191 --> 00:38:30,820
based on burning thing.
Yeah.

818
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,260
Let's face it,
releasing few talk about a hundred years

819
00:38:34,261 --> 00:38:36,400
from now looking back and going,
what were we thinking?

820
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,480
I mean,
Golly,

821
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:42,481
I mean you can see why a five gallon 
pail of gasoline is an amazingly 

822
00:38:42,481 --> 00:38:47,310
enabling thing.
You can stick it in your car and drive 

823
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:47,310
hundreds of miles,
you know,

824
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,030
and you can carry it in your hand and 
it's fairly stable.

825
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:54,330
It's a very seductive fuel.
But at the same time it has such 

826
00:38:54,551 --> 00:38:56,830
consequences.
And when we look,

827
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,110
when we figure out the next energy 
source,

828
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:01,960
when we look back,
hopefully in a couple of hundred

829
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,260
years we will go,
what were we thinking?

830
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,010
Oh,
crazy.

831
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,770
Yeah.
We see the.

832
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:12,050
It's really hard for people to change to
once once we have a pattern that we 

833
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:12,960
follow,
it's very difficult,

834
00:39:12,961 --> 00:39:17,961
especially if we found a way to make it 
work for ourselves in spite of all the 

835
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,610
pollution.
We still rock it that way.

836
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:23,430
In spite of all the stuff that we throw 
into the ocean.

837
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,820
We still kind of happening basically on 
a daily basis.

838
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,640
Well,
you can't.

839
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,930
Once you built a structure,
it's really hard to change of course,

840
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,570
and you can't just suddenly start.
Millions of people are killed,

841
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:36,000
millions of people just because you 
decide to change energy sources.

842
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:39,690
It has to be gradual and we will be 
weaned off fossil fuels,

843
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:44,691
but they got to get a lot more scarce 
before we're going to bother just 

844
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:44,691
because of its human nature.
Will.

845
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:47,010
The ultimate use of fossil fuels is a g 
is a rocket.

846
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:50,040
I mean that's the ultimate display of 
it.

847
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:53,820
Shooting into space with a giant plume 
of fire behind you.

848
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,260
It's a brute force way.
I mean it.

849
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,230
We're burning dinosaurs to get this 
space,

850
00:39:58,231 --> 00:40:03,231
but it's so far.
It's the only way we figured out how so 

851
00:40:03,231 --> 00:40:03,231
far it's the only way.
Now when you,

852
00:40:03,231 --> 00:40:06,720
you think about like what's possible for
the future when they start talking about

853
00:40:06,721 --> 00:40:09,870
all these different propulsion methods 
that will someday be available.

854
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:12,870
What if any of them appear viable?

855
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,730
Yeah.
You're asking me to predict physics,

856
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,370
uh,
inventions of the future,

857
00:40:19,371 --> 00:40:20,270
which,
Gosh,

858
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,820
I wish I could do that.
I'd go,

859
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,100
I'd do it tomorrow.
I don't know,

860
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:26,070
uh,
to,

861
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,940
to me the obvious answer is,
uh,

862
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:33,970
every single molecule that exists,
every complex molecule and Adam was put 

863
00:40:34,551 --> 00:40:39,440
together in a blast furnace of a place 
with almost unlimited heat and pressure,

864
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:44,560
which is the center of a son and it 
stored that energy in every single atom 

865
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:50,051
and molecule that exists.
And we have yet to find a good way to 

866
00:40:50,051 --> 00:40:52,940
get that energy back out.
But there is more energy and a pencil.

867
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,620
You know,
if you,

868
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:58,710
if you could truly get the energy that's
inside all of the molecules that are in 

869
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:58,710
there,
there's,

870
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,230
there's so much energy stored there.
You know,

871
00:41:00,231 --> 00:41:03,530
we have like wood that stored sunlight,
right?

872
00:41:03,531 --> 00:41:06,410
And we by burning it,
we can release that stored solar power,

873
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:11,530
even nuclear,
but we haven't found a clean way to 

874
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:14,150
release the energy to gives us nuclear 
power.

875
00:41:14,151 --> 00:41:15,650
We can do it,
but we're still,

876
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:21,130
you know,
we're kind of cave men about it and we 

877
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:23,441
haven't got a clean way.
So I'm certain that at some point we 

878
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:25,660
will figure out how to,
whether it will be cold fusion or,

879
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:30,661
or just fusion itself,
but if you read what they're doing in 

880
00:41:30,661 --> 00:41:30,830
the various laboratories around the 
world,

881
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,620
even the experts think,
well,

882
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,980
we're probably years away

883
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,980
from,
from being able to contain fusion so 

884
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:38,980
that it becomes a net positive power 
source.

885
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,400
And,
but you know,

886
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:43,100
when the experts are saying it's 50 
years until we can do it,

887
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:43,920
who knows?
Yeah.

888
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:48,940
There was a recent article in one of the
science magazines that the volume of 

889
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:55,181
nuclear waste could be reduced by 90 
percent that they've shown that they can

890
00:41:55,371 --> 00:41:57,970
mix plutonium contaminated waste,
uh,

891
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:03,040
with blast furnace slag and turn it into
glass and it reduces its volume by 85 to

892
00:42:04,431 --> 00:42:09,431
95 percent and effectively locks in the 
radioactive plutonium creating a stable 

893
00:42:09,951 --> 00:42:12,890
end products.
I've always felt like,

894
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,250
I mean,
the,

895
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,910
the nuclear waste thing is a huge issue 
obviously.

896
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:21,911
I mean,
they've done a lot of weird things like 

897
00:42:21,911 --> 00:42:21,911
dig holes in the ground and buried in 
there.

898
00:42:21,911 --> 00:42:25,361
And Nevada and you know,
and what's going on now in Fukushima is 

899
00:42:25,361 --> 00:42:25,361
very disturbing.

900
00:42:25,361 --> 00:42:26,330
They're trying to figure out how to 
contain it.

901
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,220
Sure.
Coming up with all these different ways,

902
00:42:28,221 --> 00:42:30,770
but it's a fascinating thing about human
innovation.

903
00:42:30,771 --> 00:42:35,771
If their backs are up against the wall,
those crazy monkeys figuring out a way 

904
00:42:35,771 --> 00:42:36,290
to fix things.
Yeah.

905
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:40,130
And it's just our nature and necessity 
is the main mother and we need to.

906
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,290
Sometimes we don't think we have the 
necessity.

907
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:47,860
And nuclear waste is a big problem with 
fossil fuel waste is a huge problem as 

908
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,530
well.
And neither of them are perfect.

909
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,230
Even solar energy has waste,
you know,

910
00:42:51,231 --> 00:42:54,410
because of you have to build all the 
solar panels and you have to collect all

911
00:42:54,411 --> 00:42:56,240
the rare earth metals.
None of it's for free.

912
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:59,660
We have to find as best to trade off as 
we can and,

913
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:04,661
uh,
and still be able to try and sustain as 

914
00:43:04,661 --> 00:43:05,720
good as standard of living for as many 
people around the planet as possible.

915
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,800
And uh,
and we've done we,

916
00:43:08,801 --> 00:43:13,801
I mean,
we feed more people now than we ever 

917
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:13,801
have,
right?

918
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:13,801
But,
but how,

919
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:14,840
uh,
how do we do it in the future?

920
00:43:14,841 --> 00:43:16,960
How do we get better at it?
I'm not sure he,

921
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,040
there's so many variables obviously.
And,

922
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:19,850
but I,
I'm,

923
00:43:19,851 --> 00:43:23,600
I'm always very excited when I see 
something like this that has like,

924
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:28,100
oh my faith in the crazy humans has been
restored like these,

925
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:33,310
these nuts have figured out a way to fix
an issue or at least reducing issue 

926
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,940
significantly by as much as 90 plus 
percent.

927
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,080
Um,
the,

928
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,680
the,
the fossil fuel thing to me is a,

929
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:43,370
is a weird one because obviously I enjoy
it,

930
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:48,371
we use it,
it's so important for almost everything 

931
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:50,321
we do,
but obviously this is going to create a 

932
00:43:50,321 --> 00:43:52,361
problem some day and there's no better 
example for that for me than the 

933
00:43:52,581 --> 00:43:57,020
automobile pollution or pollution that 
you get from jet airplanes,

934
00:43:57,021 --> 00:43:58,280
uh,
on a daily basis.

935
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,880
How much it means there's a big impact 
in the environment.

936
00:44:01,881 --> 00:44:03,500
Every time the space shuttle gets 
launched,

937
00:44:03,501 --> 00:44:04,430
isn't it a,
well,

938
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:07,220
compared to everything else it's.
Well,

939
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:12,250
and of course space shuttle is retired,
but we only flew the special at 135 

940
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:12,250
times.
I mean,

941
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,090
you couldn't even measure compared to 
everything else,

942
00:44:14,091 --> 00:44:19,091
the pollution that it injected,
if it had gotten to the point where it 

943
00:44:19,091 --> 00:44:19,091
was like Arab travel.
Yeah.

944
00:44:19,091 --> 00:44:20,210
Well you wouldn't want,
you know,

945
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,190
thousands of those launch and everyday,
you know,

946
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,650
but that wasn't,
that wasn't a possibility.

947
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,940
It wasn't.
But it was going to do.

948
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,000
But compare it to just,
you know,

949
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,280
how we burn coal to generate electricity
and how we use to transport ourselves

950
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,890
around the,
uh,

951
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:36,510
you know,
there are 40,

952
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:37,620
what,
42,000

953
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:39,690
people a year killed just in car 
crashes,

954
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,380
you know,
that is a,

955
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,460
it's a societal norm in the United 
States.

956
00:44:44,461 --> 00:44:46,170
We expect that.
We say that's okay.

957
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:47,970
It's all right to kill 42,000
people.

958
00:44:47,971 --> 00:44:50,280
So we have the freedom to drive our cars
around wherever we want.

959
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:55,230
Kind of an interesting level of accepted
a disaster,

960
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,790
you know,
we just say that's okay.

961
00:44:56,791 --> 00:45:01,791
And that's not,
that's not some global warming problem 

962
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:01,791
that may manifest itself on our 
children.

963
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:04,110
That's a guaranteed thing this year.
And uh,

964
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,340
and that's,
uh,

965
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,030
just an interesting thing to hold up the
mirror and look at yourself and say,

966
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:10,320
okay,
that's,

967
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:11,650
that's what we decide is alright,

968
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:17,110
who's also a matter of,
of a very statistically significant 

969
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:20,831
number of years of your life that you 
lose by living in a small filled 

970
00:45:20,831 --> 00:45:21,320
environment.
That's a fact.

971
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:26,340
Sure.
And we don't think about that because 

972
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:26,340
you can survive and be healthy in New 
York City,

973
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:30,160
you know,
you can go jogging down the streets of 

974
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,230
Manhattan and you know,
drink spring water and think 

975
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:32,570
everything's all groovy.
But the reality is if you're living in a

976
00:45:32,571 --> 00:45:35,210
city and you're breathing in those fumes
on a daily basis,

977
00:45:35,211 --> 00:45:37,520
it will reduce your life.
Period.

978
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:37,740
Yeah.

979
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,250
But,
but yeah,

980
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,280
I agree with you,
but none of us are lasting forever and 

981
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:46,280
people live where they want to live for 
all the reasons.

982
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,360
And only one of the variables is how 
many years are you going to live there?

983
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,640
Right?
Would you rather live in the middle of 

984
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,620
nowhere where the air is clean,
but there's no people to talk to or in 

985
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,560
the theater is really bad.
Theater is always bad.

986
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:01,590
Let's be honest.
What's the best theater or even nearly 

987
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:03,380
as good as the best movie.
It's not even close,

988
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,840
antiquated,
goofy art form.

989
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,620
I'm okay here.
I have to ask you about these guys.

990
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,290
Yep.
Aliens.

991
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,590
That little alien guy.
Sam,

992
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,370
when,
when you're up there,

993
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,270
when you're in space,

994
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,310
I mean,

995
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:26,610
do you ponder the possibility?
And is that something that you ever 

996
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:30,091
wonder yourself?
Are there intelligent life forms out 

997
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:30,091
there?
And if so,

998
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:32,020
do you think that they watch us?
Do you think they're aware of us?

999
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:36,770
You mentioned earlier that with Galileo 
inventing the telescope,

1000
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:41,750
uh,
he was tortured for pointing out that we

1001
00:46:41,751 --> 00:46:46,751
weren't the center of the universe and 
I'm with every invention that's come 

1002
00:46:47,241 --> 00:46:52,241
since then,
we've been able to prove more and more 

1003
00:46:52,241 --> 00:46:54,131
conclusively just how far from the 
center of the universe we are and also 

1004
00:46:54,131 --> 00:46:56,380
how huge the university is.
And billions of years old and,

1005
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:58,640
and more vast.
The numbers are so big,

1006
00:46:58,641 --> 00:47:02,030
they're,
they're incomprehensible both in numbers

1007
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,820
of,
of stars and number of galaxies.

1008
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:08,530
And within the last few years,
using the great-great-grandchildren of,

1009
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:12,920
of Galileo's telescope,
we are seeing planets directly,

1010
00:47:12,921 --> 00:47:16,490
seeing planets around nearby stars.
And we've seen thousands of them.

1011
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,010
So we've basically shown that every 
single star has planets.

1012
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:25,040
And so there's an unlimited number of 
planets out there.

1013
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:29,500
And so to think that with an unlimited 
number of that,

1014
00:47:29,501 --> 00:47:34,501
we are the only life in the universe to 
me is just a natural extension of 

1015
00:47:34,501 --> 00:47:35,200
thinking that we're the center of the 
universe.

1016
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:36,130
You know,
it's an arrogance,

1017
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,490
egotism thing was based on belief 
instead of fact.

1018
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:45,330
But it's also,
I think arrogant and egotistical to 

1019
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:47,510
think that were so fascinating and we're
so revelation area and,

1020
00:47:47,511 --> 00:47:52,511
and so special that somehow a weird big 
black eyed monsters with no hair on 

1021
00:47:53,651 --> 00:47:58,651
their bodies are sneaking around staring
at us because we are so special.

1022
00:47:59,681 --> 00:48:04,681
To me that's just.
I mean it's fun science fiction and it 

1023
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:05,970
makes for great entertainment,
but it's a,

1024
00:48:05,971 --> 00:48:06,970
it's not real.

1025
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,530
Well.
I've heard that the archetype of the,

1026
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:14,670
the doctor,
the alien with the large black eyes and 

1027
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:14,670
the,
the,

1028
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:19,520
you know,
the strange big head that what it may 

1029
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,521
very well come from is that the actual 
birth experience for children the first 

1030
00:48:22,521 --> 00:48:26,661
time the eyes are outside of the womb,
they don't have clear vision and they 

1031
00:48:26,661 --> 00:48:28,260
see the bright light of the operating 
room,

1032
00:48:28,261 --> 00:48:30,630
which is the first time they've ever 
been exposed to something like that.

1033
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,120
And it's an incredibly traumatic 
experience.

1034
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,660
They recognize the eyes,
which are enormous in front of the head,

1035
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:40,940
the face with a white mask on it,
feature lists interesting.

1036
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:45,990
And that this is most likely what the 
archetype of the experience,

1037
00:48:45,991 --> 00:48:46,620
the,
uh,

1038
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:50,880
the medical experiments that supposedly 
go on with these aliens,

1039
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,440
that,
that's the origin of it.

1040
00:48:52,441 --> 00:48:53,780
And it's,
well,

1041
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:57,150
we have this very arrogant idea that 
children don't remember things,

1042
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:57,990
you know.

1043
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:01,250
And it's been my point about 
circumcision I,

1044
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:03,600
I don't think circumcision is a good 
idea.

1045
00:49:03,601 --> 00:49:05,850
I think it's ridiculous.
I think it's antiquated.

1046
00:49:05,851 --> 00:49:10,851
It's Jen genital torture.
And I think the justification is one of 

1047
00:49:10,851 --> 00:49:11,310
them is that the baby doesn't remember 
it.

1048
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:16,850
And I'm always like,
how do you know the baby doesn't 

1049
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:16,850
remember just because they don't have a 
point of reference or context.

1050
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:18,120
It's very possible they remember it 
well.

1051
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:23,180
The scientific answer to the alien 
abduction experience and these cold hard

1052
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:28,970
medical examinations,
emotionless medical examinations may 

1053
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:32,100
very well just be the birthing process 
or some of it will search both.

1054
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:33,390
And then the,
you know,

1055
00:49:33,391 --> 00:49:38,391
the incredible feeling of helplessness 
that they have is basically their body 

1056
00:49:38,391 --> 00:49:41,940
doesn't move yet and that these intense 
memories are burned deep,

1057
00:49:41,941 --> 00:49:43,320
deep,
deep into our consciousness.

1058
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,680
I think it also just comes from a fear 
of being alone and a fear of being 

1059
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,060
mortal.
And if we can somehow convince ourselves

1060
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:56,090
that,
that neither of those two things are 

1061
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:58,431
true,
then it's a great comfort to folks and 

1062
00:49:58,431 --> 00:49:58,890
to think that,
that there's other life out there.

1063
00:49:58,891 --> 00:49:59,460
And,
and it's,

1064
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,150
it's,
uh,

1065
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:05,390
it's,
it's holding us as super special and 

1066
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:05,390
it's been here before and it's going to 
be back.

1067
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:06,630
It's,
it's a nice seductive thought process to

1068
00:50:06,631 --> 00:50:07,770
go down.
So,

1069
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,040
but there is there.
I mean,

1070
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:14,280
we have left Earth,
we have 13 years ago this month,

1071
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:19,281
we permanently started living on the 
space station with the International 

1072
00:50:19,281 --> 00:50:22,580
Space Station program.
And the Soviets had been there for 

1073
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:24,621
decades before on their space stations.
We have sent probes to every planet in 

1074
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:26,520
the solar system and got one going out 
to Pluto right now.

1075
00:50:26,521 --> 00:50:30,170
And we're rovers on a couple different,
three different planets and moons in the

1076
00:50:30,171 --> 00:50:31,970
solar system.
Uh,

1077
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:37,840
if aliens did show up,
I don't think their behavior would be 

1078
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,170
the one that is in the common science 
fiction media,

1079
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,700
you know,
it just doesn't make sense.

1080
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,830
So,
so I,

1081
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:47,831
uh,
I am convinced there's life in the 

1082
00:50:47,831 --> 00:50:47,831
universe,
you know,

1083
00:50:47,831 --> 00:50:47,831
just starting the statistics of it.
It just makes sense.

1084
00:50:47,831 --> 00:50:48,800
It's,
it's just,

1085
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:53,850
um,
it's just egotism to think that we're 

1086
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:56,261
that special.
But I think it's also just egotism to 

1087
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:58,631
think that we're so special that were 
the object of great secretive 

1088
00:50:58,631 --> 00:50:58,631
fascination by higher beings.

1089
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,800
Well,
I think you're very humble and so you 

1090
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:03,800
look at us and say that it wouldn't be 
that interesting,

1091
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,270
but I say to you,
imagine if we found out that there was a

1092
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:10,050
planet just outside of our solar system 
where there were some people that were,

1093
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,270
were there,
they were just like human beings,

1094
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,000
but they will like human beings from the
13 hundreds.

1095
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:20,050
Yeah.
They just hadn't figured anything out 

1096
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:20,050
yet.
We would be like,

1097
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:20,050
holy shit,
they have guns.

1098
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:22,920
They figured out the wheel that lighten 
their city's on fire.

1099
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:28,040
They're crazy.
They just haven't figured out mass 

1100
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:28,040
communication yet.
And most of them can't read.

1101
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,610
I think we would be as a lot like us 
right now.

1102
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:32,130
It's just a lot like us right now.
We really haven't changed that much.

1103
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:35,520
But I mean if we found some people just 
from a thousand years ago,

1104
00:51:35,521 --> 00:51:40,521
a thousand years in our past,
we would be absolutely incredibly 

1105
00:51:40,521 --> 00:51:40,521
fascinated.

1106
00:51:40,521 --> 00:51:44,340
I think if we found some being somewhere
that had harnessed the power of fire,

1107
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:46,050
and if we went back 40,000
years ago,

1108
00:51:46,051 --> 00:51:47,790
I think we'd find it incredibly 
fascinating.

1109
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:51,390
So the stuff that we can do,
I don't buy it.

1110
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:56,420
I think if I was an alien,
I would be so fascinated by these 

1111
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:59,931
freaks,
these pink monkeys with bank sticks and 

1112
00:51:59,931 --> 00:52:02,481
the Internet and religions and all the 
freak show stuff that we have down here 

1113
00:52:02,481 --> 00:52:07,461
on earth.
I think we would be the most wonderful 

1114
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:08,220
freak show of all time.
I've often said that if there is,

1115
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:11,790
if there is intelligent life in the 
earth that I think are outside of earth,

1116
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,770
I think that earth is probably the 
Tiawana of outer space.

1117
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:18,560
Which explains why all visitations come 
in the middle of the night,

1118
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:23,650
that they're just,
they're hammered and they want to see a 

1119
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:23,650
show.
They want to go see the freak show.

1120
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:28,460
I think if I was an intelligent being,
I do not buy the idea what would be so 

1121
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:31,020
special about human beings?
Where do we start?

1122
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:36,380
Okay.
There's a lot special about this crazy 

1123
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:36,960
species above all other species on this 
planet.

1124
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,030
There's 7 billion of them.
Okay.

1125
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:44,031
They're like rats on a sinking ship.
They inhabit every little spot in the 

1126
00:52:44,031 --> 00:52:44,280
ocean,
find a little floating thing.

1127
00:52:44,281 --> 00:52:47,220
Poking out of the ocean were some plants
are growing on it.

1128
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:50,280
Boom is a whole whole sea of people live
in there.

1129
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,510
You know,
go to Hawaii,

1130
00:52:51,511 --> 00:52:54,600
this little tiny spot.
It's a million people in Hawaii who were

1131
00:52:54,601 --> 00:52:59,100
crazy and I think I would look,
I think we got to go there and we got to

1132
00:52:59,101 --> 00:53:04,101
go to earth.
I think we would be probably one of the 

1133
00:53:04,101 --> 00:53:05,490
most fascinating things to observe 
because we're so incredibly advanced and

1134
00:53:05,491 --> 00:53:09,480
yet so contradictive so,
so hypocritical,

1135
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:11,940
so ridiculous,
so easily led,

1136
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:13,710
so easily tricked and fooled.

1137
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:17,820
We have access to instant information,
but yet we choose to believe some of the

1138
00:53:17,821 --> 00:53:19,800
most ridiculous things of all time.
Yeah,

1139
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,400
I,
I agree with you though that I find the 

1140
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,280
evidence of us context,
but aliens,

1141
00:53:26,281 --> 00:53:29,520
incredibly uncompelling and the people 
that I talked to,

1142
00:53:29,521 --> 00:53:34,521
I,
I did a Scifi show called Joe Rogan 

1143
00:53:34,521 --> 00:53:37,011
questions.
Everything where I met with a lot of 

1144
00:53:37,011 --> 00:53:38,190
these Ufo guys and I felt like I was 
talking to religious fanatics.

1145
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:43,210
Yeah.
It's just like talking to a religious 

1146
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:44,871
fanatic.
It's just they feel like they're too 

1147
00:53:44,871 --> 00:53:46,311
clever for the Koran,
so they fall for the blue book project.

1148
00:53:47,161 --> 00:53:48,480
Blue Book is their,
their Lord.

1149
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:53,690
So two weeks ago a satire paper in 
Canada published a thing about what I 

1150
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:55,920
did at a movie theater watching the 
movie gravity and they said,

1151
00:53:55,921 --> 00:54:00,840
I heckled it and I've heard about that 
and I farted to protest the movie.

1152
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,610
You did all this stuff and got thrown 
out of the theater.

1153
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:05,190
That's really rude.
I thought it was very funny.

1154
00:54:05,191 --> 00:54:06,210
Right?
Read this article.

1155
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:11,560
Thousands of people believed it and sent
notes and send it to their friends and 

1156
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:11,790
hey look,
hey,

1157
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:12,120
look,
hey,

1158
00:54:12,121 --> 00:54:12,600
look,
this is,

1159
00:54:12,601 --> 00:54:17,601
this must be the truth because I believe
it and that thinking is so easily 

1160
00:54:18,301 --> 00:54:23,301
prevalent and dominates a lot of 
populist conclusion making when in fact 

1161
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:27,150
it's not based on fact at all because 
people want to believe stuff,

1162
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:32,240
but they don't want to spend any time 
actually doing the thinking or the 

1163
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,240
research about it.
And so,

1164
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,420
uh,
you know,

1165
00:54:33,421 --> 00:54:35,610
that that's pervasive,
right across all cultures,

1166
00:54:35,611 --> 00:54:37,550
including what people think about,
you know,

1167
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:39,960
alien abduction.
Yeah.

1168
00:54:39,961 --> 00:54:44,100
That was also a real problem with the 
access to information right now.

1169
00:54:44,101 --> 00:54:49,101
So beautiful.
Anybody can get information at anytime 

1170
00:54:49,101 --> 00:54:49,101
but it's not vetted.

1171
00:54:49,101 --> 00:54:50,220
So,
and there's also a lot of what they call

1172
00:54:50,221 --> 00:54:53,010
satire sites,
which are just not satire.

1173
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,090
They just lie,
right?

1174
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:54,930
I mean,
there's,

1175
00:54:54,931 --> 00:54:57,600
there's been,
there's this one national news something

1176
00:54:57,601 --> 00:55:02,601
or another website that people keep 
constantly tweeting me stories from and 

1177
00:55:02,601 --> 00:55:04,420
they just make up stories.
There was one about that,

1178
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:09,430
uh,
I retweeted before I read where it came 

1179
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:11,511
from,
that Texas decided to use sexual 

1180
00:55:11,511 --> 00:55:12,770
predators for medical experiments and 
there's,

1181
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:14,340
but there's just,
it's just a lie.

1182
00:55:14,341 --> 00:55:19,341
There's no,
it's like if you read the onion within 

1183
00:55:19,341 --> 00:55:19,341
five minutes or five seconds,
you realize,

1184
00:55:19,341 --> 00:55:20,430
okay,
they're doing comedy.

1185
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,880
This is funny business humorous,
they,

1186
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:27,890
they're not being humorous,
just lying and they're calling it 

1187
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:27,960
satire.
When you see that attributed to you like

1188
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,690
farting in a movie theater,
that's rude.

1189
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,360
And I've read it and I,
I had it sent to me like,

1190
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:34,620
this guy's an asshole.

1191
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:38,670
Like he farted in the movie.
It made me laugh,

1192
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:40,950
but the reaction to it made me laugh as 
well.

1193
00:55:40,951 --> 00:55:42,900
It's just like,
come on people please,

1194
00:55:42,901 --> 00:55:43,230
we,
you know,

1195
00:55:43,231 --> 00:55:48,231
we,
we are actually sell separate from the 

1196
00:55:48,231 --> 00:55:49,290
one celled organisms.
We have brains and reason and experience

1197
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:54,030
in logic and use it.
We're clearly still developing clearly.

1198
00:55:54,031 --> 00:55:57,060
Right?
I mean there's both and everybody.

1199
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:01,030
This folks like you that have 
experienced technology and innovation at

1200
00:56:01,031 --> 00:56:02,420
its very height,
the,

1201
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:02,970
the,
the,

1202
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:07,110
the highest highs,
you've actually gone out above the,

1203
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:12,150
the actual atmosphere of our earth,
and you've experienced the amount of 

1204
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:15,360
technological sophistication that it 
takes to pull something like that off.

1205
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,150
But then there's other folks that are 
barely there,

1206
00:56:18,151 --> 00:56:23,151
chimps with a language and they exist 
amongst us because of this complex 

1207
00:56:23,151 --> 00:56:26,901
society.
It makes it really for people to just 

1208
00:56:26,901 --> 00:56:27,550
get by and breed and make more dumb 
people.

1209
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:29,980
It's so.
It's so easy.

1210
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:32,230
Well,
so you've got to have that,

1211
00:56:32,231 --> 00:56:33,910
right?
Is this the Yin and the Yang of life?

1212
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,540
Uh,
you know,

1213
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:41,710
I think the real key to it is what does 
everybody want to get out of it?

1214
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:44,530
What do you want to get out of your life
and what do you,

1215
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,640
what do you find is your own compulsion?
What,

1216
00:56:46,641 --> 00:56:51,641
what is it that that gives you the 
satisfaction at the end of the day and 

1217
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:55,111
it may be that stuff you've read on the 
internet or maybe the television show 

1218
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:55,870
that you watch or maybe the sports team 
that you idolize,

1219
00:56:55,871 --> 00:57:00,871
read maybe some new invention somewhere 
or some area or your huge belief into 

1220
00:57:00,871 --> 00:57:02,890
some particular subset of what we know 
or we don't know.

1221
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:07,060
And to me that's all right.
Everybody should be doing that.

1222
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,700
So long as they're pushing themselves to
something that they're interested in.

1223
00:57:09,701 --> 00:57:14,701
They're trying to get the best out of 
the things that they're naturally 

1224
00:57:14,701 --> 00:57:16,360
inclined towards and,
and make the most of it.

1225
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:21,610
It's just been what I've been doing.
I'm just interested in this particular 

1226
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:25,111
part of space flight and a and m case,
or was fine by me live and let live,

1227
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:32,130
but don't spend all of those efforts in 
taking your particular set of interests 

1228
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:36,580
and your beliefs that,
that have given you this area and trying

1229
00:57:36,581 --> 00:57:39,400
to force them on other people.
Make them good for you.

1230
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:41,410
Offering them up for other people to 
believe if they like,

1231
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,160
but then,
uh,

1232
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,870
but don't,
don't try.

1233
00:57:43,871 --> 00:57:48,871
And convince everybody else in the world
that they're a Ufo is just because this 

1234
00:57:48,871 --> 00:57:48,871
is what you believe.
Don't.

1235
00:57:48,871 --> 00:57:51,340
Why would that become your,
your,

1236
00:57:51,341 --> 00:57:53,200
uh,
your mantra?

1237
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:54,310
Why would it be so important?

1238
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:57,770
I think it's just like people that want 
people to convert to Islam,

1239
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,160
they just have this idea in their head 
that this is the truth and they have to 

1240
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:03,160
pursue it.
It's just like a religion.

1241
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,570
I think that the religion of belief,
you know,

1242
00:58:05,571 --> 00:58:05,920
the,
the,

1243
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:06,620
the,
the,

1244
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:08,630
the,
the intensity of ideology.

1245
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:11,960
Once you know there's,
I know people that want you to be on a t

1246
00:58:11,961 --> 00:58:14,220
and t because that's their network know 
like,

1247
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:16,460
man,
I want you to do with verizon and at and

1248
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:21,480
t there's a weird clan thing that human 
beings have and blackberry versus ipad 

1249
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:24,590
and the people that believe in aliens,
they all stick together.

1250
00:58:24,591 --> 00:58:27,680
They go and they have conferences and it
becomes a part of their culture.

1251
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:30,230
It's fun and there's this thing that 
happens,

1252
00:58:30,231 --> 00:58:35,231
this confirmation bias where they don't 
want to look at anything outside of 

1253
00:58:35,231 --> 00:58:39,010
something that confirmed their idea.
They don't want to look at it 

1254
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:42,281
objectively.
I think having a belief system is 

1255
00:58:42,281 --> 00:58:42,350
important.
Did you see anything up there?

1256
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,660
Anything Weird?
No lights

1257
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,960
world is really weird to look at this.
It's fascinating to look at in the 

1258
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,520
storms around the planet and the,
and the uh,

1259
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:55,120
I was out on a spacewalk going through 
the southern lights,

1260
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:55,990
you know,
with the,

1261
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:58,220
with the Aurora,
this case,

1262
00:58:58,221 --> 00:59:03,221
Aurora Australis coming up underneath my
feet for a thousand miles and that is a 

1263
00:59:03,671 --> 00:59:05,290
weird thing to see.
It's beautiful.

1264
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:06,570
It's fascinating.
It's,

1265
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:10,450
it doesn't green real it.
Mostly what you see in pictures is green

1266
00:59:10,451 --> 00:59:13,340
because that's what the cameras see,
but in reality it's,

1267
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:18,380
it's got red and orange and yellow 
coming out the top of it so that your 

1268
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:20,460
eyes can pick up and it's,
it's a,

1269
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:24,140
you can't believe it's real.
Like how could this possibly be earth?

1270
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:26,420
How can this be going on all the time?
It's,

1271
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:32,050
it is phenomenal to see,
especially when you can see for several 

1272
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,100
thousand miles and it's under your feet.
It's a,

1273
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:35,870
it's amazing to see.
So yeah,

1274
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:38,600
we see amazing stuff all the time.

1275
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:43,980
Yeah.
That's way cooler than some dork in a 

1276
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:43,980
flying saucer.
It doesn't even have.

1277
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,460
He doesn't even have the manners to come
and say hi.

1278
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,270
He's got a circle around and abducted 
you and erase your memory.

1279
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:53,370
Me,
the world is is fascinating and unknown 

1280
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:54,360
and interesting enough with helping to 
invent little green men visiting

1281
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:55,730
it.
It really is,

1282
00:59:55,731 --> 00:59:56,790
and it.
It is.

1283
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:01,860
The awareness of how fascinating truly 
is is greatly enhanced by people like 

1284
01:00:02,361 --> 01:00:03,210
you.
So I want.

1285
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:05,570
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much for doing this.

1286
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:10,720
Thank you very much for being you.
Thank you very much for writing this 

1287
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:11,990
book and astronaut's guide to life on 
earth.

1288
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:14,960
What going to space taught me about 
ingenuity,

1289
01:00:14,961 --> 01:00:18,020
determination,
and being prepared for anything.

1290
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:20,960
Colonel Chris Hadfield.
You Sir are bad.

1291
01:00:20,961 --> 01:00:22,830
Motherfucker was really nice.
Thank you very much.

1292
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:25,490
This was very enjoyable and fascinating 
conversation.

1293
01:00:25,491 --> 01:00:26,480
I really,
really appreciate it.

1294
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:28,070
So folks,

1295

Is it available everywhere?
Can they get it on Amazon

1296
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:35,510

Hmm.
