00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,750
Hello Freak bitches.
I might have to spark up a joint fess

2
00:00:04,751 --> 00:00:06,700
up.
So you just want real deep,

3
00:00:06,701 --> 00:00:08,920
real quick.
I was hoping I was hoping would go that

4
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:11,530
way.
Do you want some you smoke the weed?

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,390
I could do it for the first time.
I'd be willing to try it ones.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,660
Well I don't know if I want to give it
to you for the first time.

7
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:18,610
I don't want you to freak out.
You don't smoke pot at all.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,640
The truth is I s I smoked pot once ever.
It was in first day of college,

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,040
but I never stopped.
So that's really just once.

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,570
Oh,
I understand.

11
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:31,330
So you smoked pot all the time.
So he did it once and you just kept

12
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,670
going.
I'd be willing to try it a second time

13
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:36,600
is what I'm saying.
I understand what you're saying or for

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,540
sure what hers,
like

15
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,180
what has life been like for Scott Adams
during this election?

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:47,853
You,
um,

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,060
came into the,
well,

18
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,260
you're obviously always well known for
being the creator of Dilbert,

19
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,690
but,
um,

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,040
along selection cycle,
all of a sudden there was,

21
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,570
I had,
you know,

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,940
people that are already in contact with,
they were saying,

23
00:01:03,941 --> 00:01:05,860
you know,
Scott Adams is a trump supporter.

24
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,380
And I was like,
what Scott Adams,

25
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:09,880
the Dilbert guys,
a trump supporter.

26
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,140
Because you know,
everyone assumes you meet someone and

27
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:17,050
they're uh,
in the creative business,

28
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,700
you know,
you're in a creative business,

29
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:20,230
your,
you write a comic strip,

30
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,320
you would assume that you would be left
wing guy.

31
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,780
Like almost almost immediately.

32
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,310
Well,
I'm neither left nor right.

33
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,720
I'm sort of all over the place.
My,

34
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,630
my views didn't match,
you know,

35
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,320
either of the major candidates on
anything.

36
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,550
So you're a free thinker.
I like to think I'm right and everybody

37
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:39,890
else was wrong.
I would like that too.

38
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,600
I'm actually,
um,

39
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:48,070
my larger philosophical grounding is
that is informed by my experience,

40
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:48,670
says,
Hey,

41
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,360
I've noticed,
I'm not sure if he knew that.

42
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,830
No,
I didn't know you're a hypnotist.

43
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,920
So in my twenties,
I went to hypnosis school and became an

44
00:01:54,921 --> 00:01:57,860
actual train certified hypnotist.
Wow.

45
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,620
And one of the things you learn as a
hypnotist is it,

46
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:04,400
the world is backwards to the way people
normally perceive it.

47
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,430
So normally you see the world as,
Hey,

48
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:09,910
you know,
90% of the time people are irrational

49
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,940
and doing rational things,
but 10% of the time we just go knots and

50
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:14,930
we do stupid things.

51
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,690
And it's because something happened.
This sparked,

52
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,800
right?
That's the normal view of the world.

53
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,080
The hypnotist view of the world is
opposite.

54
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,000
The hypnotist says that 90% of the time
we're a completely irrational and we're

55
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:29,120
just making rationalizations for why we
did things after the fact.

56
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,420
10% of the time we're rational.
But that's only when there's no

57
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:35,060
emotional content to the decision.
You know,

58
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:36,680
you're balancing a checkbook or
something,

59
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,580
you know,
trying to pick up,

60
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,290
you know,
the best route to someplace.

61
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,560
Um,
and so that's how I see the world.

62
00:02:42,561 --> 00:02:45,830
And so when I look at either the trump
supporters or the Clinton supporters,

63
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,690
to me from the hypnotist perspective and
someone who's studied persuasion for

64
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,120
decades,
I used it in my writing.

65
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,840
Um,
I see both sides as completely

66
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:59,800
ridiculous.
Both of both of them grounded in

67
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:02,470
complete absurdity is they're just
different.

68
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,520
Yeah.

69
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,790
But nobody knows why they're deciding
that the real reasons that people make

70
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:10,000
decisions are fear,
identity.

71
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,530
Um,
you know,

72
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,810
they have some aspiration.
They've,

73
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,430
they've got something they're trying to
solve.

74
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:18,430
There's something to try to work out.
But the reasons we give are usually

75
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,140
completely false.
And the,

76
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,420
the grounding for this
is that if you think about evolution,

77
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:28,630
I assume you believe we evolved.
Yes.

78
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,010
Um,
there was no requirement in evolution

79
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,700
that we ever understand our environment
the way we imagine that we do.

80
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:42,340
And here's an example of that.
You could believe that you are a monk.

81
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,260
You know,
you're reincarnated from the 10th

82
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:47,080
century monk like Steven Seagal.
It does.

83
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:50,380
He believe that he's like a buddha or
something from an actual,

84
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,000
like he actually got it bestowed upon
him by some Tibetan character.

85
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,010
All right,
so let's use Steven Seagal.

86
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,640
So Steven Seagal can be standing in a
grocery store next to,

87
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,930
let's say a Muslim who believes that his
profit literally flew to heaven on a

88
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:05,950
winged horse.

89
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,440
Those two people don't live the same
reality,

90
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,170
but they both buy groceries.
They both go,

91
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:12,760
they cook it,
they live,

92
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,820
they survive.
So it turns out that understanding the

93
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:17,800
reality at an actual,
you know,

94
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,400
I really know what his objective Lee
happening and I get it and I've got a

95
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:24,730
mental model that's quite accurate.
We don't need any of that.

96
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,980
So it would be deeply unlikely that we
evolved such a specific skill that's

97
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:32,350
completely unnecessary as far as we can
tell.

98
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,390
You know,
we do need to know that if I,

99
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:37,060
if you run into this wall,
you know your hand is going to hurt.

100
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,170
So there's some basic stuff,
but we're probably all in even

101
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,040
interpreting that experience
differently.

102
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,650
So there's no reason to think that the
way I think of it as the way you think

103
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,560
of it.
So I see the world is this big

104
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:52,561
irrational ball and I use the hypnotist
persuader skills to back up and try to

105
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:55,060
deduce,
you know,

106
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,590
what's really driving things.

107
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,950
And when people said I was a trump
supporter,

108
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,300
what they meant was,
um,

109
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,750
they may have only seen part of what I
was talking about.

110
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,240
I was writing about his skill as a
persuader.

111
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:13,170
And what I mean is that I noticed in him
the skills that I've developed over

112
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,860
decades for persuasion,
but I had a higher level than I've ever

113
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:21,880
seen.
Meaning that he is the most persuasive

114
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,770
living human I've ever experienced.
And I mean that in terms of,

115
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,600
uh,
actual technique,

116
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,281
you know,
he's,

117
00:05:29,281 --> 00:05:31,300
he's full of technique and it's all the
time.

118
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,730
I'll give it,
give you some examples of that.

119
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,810
First Time I noticed it was the very
first debate when Megan Kelly was asking

120
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:43,510
him the question about the insults he
had allegedly said to women,

121
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,740
not allegedly,
he said them.

122
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,820
And this is a setup that any other
politician with his set up is totally

123
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:55,300
trapped because they can either try to
like deny they sat at and then somebody

124
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:57,040
has a videotape and that doesn't work.

125
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,030
Or they can say,
oh,

126
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:01,280
I didn't mean it.
There's almost nothing you can say.

127
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,010
You're just trapped.
And that would have been the end of his

128
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:06,200
campaign.
The first debate should have been over.

129
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,540
And if you remember,
do you remember what he said?

130
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,403
No,
I don't.

131
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,940
She said,
you said this,

132
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:13,550
this and this about women.
And he smiled.

133
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,390
He sort of looked at the audience it
looked like or the camera and he said

134
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,280
only Rosie O'donnell and the audience,
he rubbed it.

135
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,930
And laughter.
Completely unexpected and a place

136
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,880
inappropriate.
Provocative.

137
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,120
And,
and what I noticed was the Rosie

138
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,660
O'donnell is that is a visual image that
everybody shares,

139
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,890
right?
You've got a picture of her.

140
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:36,950
So,
as I say the name and for his base that

141
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:40,250
he was catering to,
it was an unpopular image and one that

142
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:43,430
would just suck all the energy away from
the question,

143
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:44,570
which was toxic.

144
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,070
And really,
you know,

145
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:49,340
you can't touch the question.
You just have to suck all the energy

146
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:52,190
into another part of the room and wait
for the time to run out.

147
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,880
And that's what he did.
And it became the headline,

148
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,161
blah,
blah,

149
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:55,731
blah.
And He,

150
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:58,370
you know,
it's certainly a highlighted the things

151
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:00,350
he said about women,
maybe more than it would have,

152
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,140
but the way he escaped that got my
attention.

153
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,240
And I thought,
that doesn't look normal.

154
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,283
All right.
That,

155
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,273
that's,
uh,

156
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,300
that's operating at another level.
And so I looked for more examples of it

157
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,470
and you could see it everywhere and it
was especially clear by the time he

158
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:17,190
started saying,
um,

159
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,141
uh,
well,

160
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:19,850
the other visual things he does is he
says,

161
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:23,600
build a wall.
And you can just imagine a wall when he

162
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:24,460
says,
uh,

163
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,750
we're,
we're paying too much ransom to a ran

164
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:27,890
for those soldiers.

165
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,170
He says,
we paid,

166
00:07:29,171 --> 00:07:30,980
you know,
400 million or whatever the number is.

167
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,230
He goes,
imagine that money piled up.

168
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,060
It'd be so much money you would fill
this room.

169
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:37,010
You can't even imagine that big pile of
money.

170
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,560
You always goes for the visual because
we know that the,

171
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:41,870
the visual part of our Brayden's the
dominant part,

172
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,770
and if you can get its attention and get
it on your message,

173
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,230
it talks the rest of your brain and to
anything you want it to.

174
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,020
Um,
when he talks about Isis,

175
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,160
he goes visual also.
He doesn't say they are bad people who's

176
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:58,550
religions you know,
has been distorted to the type of thing

177
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:03,551
you might hear from Hillary Clinton.
He says they put you in cages and they

178
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,710
train you in the cage.
They chop your head off.

179
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,320
I mean,
you can see that you're playing in your

180
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:13,130
head.
So everything he does gets more

181
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:15,860
attention than everything everybody else
does because he puts it into a

182
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:16,880
provocative picture.

183
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:22,540
So that was the first thing I noticed.
Then when he got to Jeb Bush and he

184
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:25,280
needed to defeat jab because he was the
strongest competitor.

185
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,050
So if he couldn't get past him,
there was no point and he wouldn't have

186
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:30,590
to have a strong,
and he went after him fast and he went

187
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:35,540
after him with the low energy kill shot.
That's why I call these linguistic kill

188
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,940
shots.
It's not just an insult,

189
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,080
it's not just a clever nickname.
And we saw Clinton tried to come up with

190
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:44,190
clever nicknames that had no,
no,

191
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,670
no purchase whatsoever,
like dangerous Donald.

192
00:08:46,671 --> 00:08:47,570
You know,
it just didn't work.

193
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,510
But look at the,
look at low Energy Jeb.

194
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,140
Here's how it's engineered.
It's engineered for confirmation bias,

195
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,100
meaning that want the future to make
this look like a better nickname every

196
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,450
day.
And you want it to match his

197
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:04,380
physicality.
So before I ever heard low energy Jeb,

198
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,990
I had a good impression of Jeb Bush.

199
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,640
I thought when you looked at Jeb Bush,
didn't you say to yourself,

200
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,620
this guy,
it looks like a cool character.

201
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,910
Like if,
if,

202
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,730
no,
but he looked like he was an in control.

203
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,680
Um,
calm,

204
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:21,000
reasonable.
Exactly.

205
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,660
The person you'd want.
If the,

206
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,050
if the nuclear,
you know,

207
00:09:24,051 --> 00:09:27,390
question came up.
If there was some big decision Jeb Bush

208
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:31,590
isn't going to get excited about it.
Seems like a competent CEO competency.

209
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:32,430
Oh,
exactly.

210
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,390
And as soon as trump said low energy,
could you see him?

211
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:40,230
And the other way he was low energy and
he will always be low energy.

212
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:43,740
Lying Ted,
lying Ted Lying Ted was beautiful and

213
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:45,120
tag.
Cause you knew that because he's a

214
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:48,240
politician,
sometime in the next several months he's

215
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:50,850
going to say stuff that you can say is a
lie.

216
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,370
Whether it is or not,
it doesn't have to.

217
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,220
But more importantly,
uh,

218
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,900
ted has a,
a physicality about him.

219
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,260
The unfortunately he's got beady eyes.
And I've said this before,

220
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:06,600
is if you're going to cast a movie,
so we need a guy who's looks dishonest,

221
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,490
right?
It would be his face.

222
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,010
Unfortunately.
I mean,

223
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:13,520
I don't know if he's actually dishonest.
I'm not going to make the judgment.

224
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:19,250
So came up with the Zodiac killer thing.
Was that a trump fan or was it trump

225
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:22,620
himself that started saying that Ted was
the Zodiac killer.

226
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,590
Uh,
I think that probably started with the

227
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:26,424
fan.
But,

228
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,130
so the other thing that was fucking
harsh,

229
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:30,570
man,
he be given speeches.

230
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,260
Are you the Zodiac killer?
People would scream it out,

231
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:38,040
like imagine having to deal with that.
And did your father kill you know

232
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:38,980
somebody?
Yeah.

233
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,410
Yeah.
His father was,

234
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,690
maybe it's dad was the Zodiac killer.
Is that what the,

235
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,880
cause the Zodiac killer.
It was like the 70s,

236
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:45,714
right?

237
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,290
Not Be old enough.
Uh,

238
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,090
so crooked Hillary,
crooked Hillary,

239
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:52,450
same thing.
Sarah Aliens,

240
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,810
a brilliant ones.
So she wasn't physically,

241
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:57,390
you know,
as limber as a young person.

242
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:01,140
So you could imagine her sort of a
little bit crooked physically.

243
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,310
And you knew that there would be stories
coming out in which people could say,

244
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:06,660
well,
there's another example of that.

245
00:11:06,661 --> 00:11:09,390
Crookedness did you see?
But you thought that in a physical

246
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:10,530
sense,
like the way she looked,

247
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:13,140
all I thought about as corruption,
I heard Crooked Hillary.

248
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:17,340
I saw her like with like a burglar's
mask on trying to sneak away with bags

249
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:18,780
that had dollar signs on them.
Yeah.

250
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,890
Yeah.
That's what I saw.

251
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,740
If you look at any one of these
individually has nicknames,

252
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,870
you could say,
well it's sort of random.

253
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:26,640
He just got lucky.
But if you look at them all,

254
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,700
they all have that physicality.
They all have the uh,

255
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:33,990
the priming so that you know,
you'll confirmation bias will kick in

256
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:37,350
whatever you see after that we'll just
fit the label because it's the first

257
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:38,970
thing you think,
well he's a performer,

258
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,050
you know,
you,

259
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,490
you,
you can say Donald Trump is a

260
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:43,110
businessman.
He most certainly is.

261
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,090
It most certainly is a real estate
investor,

262
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:48,300
but he's been a public figure for
decades.

263
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,460
And when you're a public figure,
you're a performer.

264
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,220
He's performing all the time and he's
also,

265
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,160
he

266
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,190
likes to win.
And so when he's engaging in people,

267
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:59,350
he makes it personal.
So he's gotten very good at what's

268
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,710
called playing the dozens.
I know playing the dozens is tell us

269
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,450
it's a insult thing.
You know,

270
00:12:04,451 --> 00:12:07,540
like you can like one guy like guys in
the,

271
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,750
the hood in the inner cities.
I started out as a black term,

272
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,680
but it's essentially like a version of a
your mama contest.

273
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,000
Like,
some guys are way better at your mama

274
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:20,470
jokes.
They're way better at playing.

275
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:23,800
The dozens are way better at shitting on
other people around them.

276
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:25,300
And it's for the entertainment of each
other.

277
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,290
So a huge thing amongst comedians,
we shit on each other constantly left

278
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,720
and right,
but it's generally encouraged and we all

279
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:32,740
enjoy it,
you know?

280
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:37,460
But when a guy has decades and decades
and decades of this like Donald Trump,

281
00:12:37,461 --> 00:12:41,500
but a very high level because he's known
to be a billionaire investor who puts

282
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:44,530
his name on everything,
everything and still win big at which I

283
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,930
talk about developing systems for
succeeding,

284
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,620
one of the systems is to,
um,

285
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,500
and you do this too,
um,

286
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,960
stack together what I would call
ordinary skills until your stack is

287
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:57,100
different than anybody else's.

288
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,830
So in my case,
I'm not a great artist.

289
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,460
Uh,
you know,

290
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,980
I didn't take any writing writing
courses,

291
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,570
but I'm pretty good at drawing and I'm
pretty good at writing and up,

292
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,710
a little bit of funny.
So I put them together and I couldn't do

293
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:11,590
a comic strip because it's rare that you
get somebody who's,

294
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:14,290
let's say in the top 10% of three
different things,

295
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,110
but it's not hard to be in the top 10%
of the things if you're,

296
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,540
if you're going after them.
So if you look at trump,

297
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,560
he wrote a book on negotiating.
So he knows business,

298
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:25,900
he knows negotiating,
he knows public speaking.

299
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,940
He has a sense of humor,
a really good one.

300
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:31,150
He's quick on his feet now.
He knows politics,

301
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:33,190
you know,
from both the inside and the outside.

302
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,990
Um,
he knows twitter.

303
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,033
If,
you know,

304
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,290
I could probably go on and you would
say,

305
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,600
if you looked at any one of those
things,

306
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,520
he's not the best you've ever seen.

307
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,350
You know,
he's not the best public speaker,

308
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:48,670
the funniest person,
etc. But there aren't many people who

309
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,460
can do all of those things in the top
10%.

310
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,330
But as a public speaker,
I don't think he's nearly in the top 10%

311
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,070
I think he's a,
I mean,

312
00:13:57,071 --> 00:14:01,870
I'm just being honest.
I think he has a very poor efficiency of

313
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:03,790
of words like,
um,

314
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,580
he uses,
he repeats himself when it's not really

315
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:11,070
important and when we repeats itself,
what I usually see is like someone's

316
00:14:11,071 --> 00:14:13,390
searching for the next thing to say,
you know what I'm saying?

317
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:14,650
Like he'll say,
you know,

318
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,350
I'm going to be honest with you,
I'm going to be honest with you.

319
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,830
Okay,
I'm going to be honest with you here.

320
00:14:18,831 --> 00:14:20,830
It,
he'll do that in a way that is not,

321
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:22,480
it's not efficient,
not efficient,

322
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:24,630
but it's persuasive and that's why it
does sometimes.

323
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,360
But it also no repetition.
Repetition sometimes.

324
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,700
Sometimes.
And sometimes it's clunky.

325
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,670
Yeah.
I feel like he,

326
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:38,260
I feel like there's a lot of times where
it's his style to do that and he's done

327
00:14:38,261 --> 00:14:42,550
it before.
But even like in delivering lines,

328
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,470
you've got to know when did not talk.
Like here's birth example when he said

329
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:50,470
that he called the president of the
president of Mexico up and they had the

330
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:53,180
conversation about the wall and he said,
the wall just got 10 foot higher.

331
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,110
He's like,
yeah,

332
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,760
that's what I said.
That is what I said.

333
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,370
Like he repeats that said he should've
just let it hang.

334
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,740
He should've been said,
the wall just got 10 foot higher.

335
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:04,550
They would have went crazy and he got to
walk back and forth and just sucked it

336
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:05,900
in.
But he kept talking.

337
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,290
See,
that's not the best speaker like Obama,

338
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:13,520
I feel is a way better public speaker.
Way more efficient with his words,

339
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,020
way better control of the sentences that
he speaks.

340
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,930
But it's more professional.
I think you're judging on

341
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,710
a standard that I probably wouldn't use.
So I took the Dale Carnegie course

342
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,210
teaching you how to be a public speaker
and their course taught you zero

343
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:30,890
technique.
It was a,

344
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,310
of course on public speaking in which
they taught you nothing about technique.

345
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,200
The things that you're saying he's doing
right,

346
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,920
not necessarily technique.
What,

347
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:39,240
let me just finish this off shore.
I'm sorry.

348
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,103
What?
They taught you

349
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:44,200
confidence and,
and if you were happy and confident,

350
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,720
you would almost always do well,
even if you make a mistake,

351
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:50,920
you just correct.
So he strikes me as the confident Dale

352
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,900
Carnegie type of Speaker,
the person who's,

353
00:15:52,901 --> 00:15:56,020
who's selling an emotion.
It's an experience.

354
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,090
You're not going there really to get
information.

355
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,700
It's not really,
you know,

356
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,970
well crafted jokes you're looking for,
you're going there to feel something and

357
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:07,140
you can't,
you can't deny that 30,000 people in a

358
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,040
stadium with red hats on,
you know,

359
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:12,970
they were feeling something.
So in terms of delivering and emotion,

360
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,523
top 10%.

361
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:15,990
Hmm.
Interesting.

362
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,380
Um,
well I think that for absolutely one

363
00:16:19,381 --> 00:16:24,381
thing you could say is he knows how to
do the Donald Trump thing and the Donald

364
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,570
Trump thing is very different than the
rest of the politicians thing.

365
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,730
Right?
The Donald Trump thing is not humble.

366
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,660
The Donald Trump thing,
we'll tell you about his past successes

367
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,420
and use them to tell you how he's going
to be successful in the future.

368
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,000
The Donald Trump thing,
when confronted with certain things,

369
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,400
like the thing about it,
you know him saying something about

370
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:44,490
Hillary lacking stamina and then you,
it goes off about having a winning

371
00:16:44,491 --> 00:16:46,320
temperament.
I have a winning temperament.

372
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:50,310
There's not a lot of people who could do
that in that sort of a political form.

373
00:16:50,311 --> 00:16:53,850
Like if if,
say Mitt Romney was running for

374
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:54,810
president,
he started saying,

375
00:16:54,811 --> 00:16:56,220
I have a winning temperament.
I,

376
00:16:56,221 --> 00:16:56,980
they'd be like,
oh,

377
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,170
it's gone fucking crazy.

378
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,290
Right.
You remember how Howard Dean got knocked

379
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,680
out of the race just for screaming?
He just screamed at a rally and it was

380
00:17:04,681 --> 00:17:06,450
over.
The wind came out of the balloon.

381
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,760
But you know,
you know what Howard Dean did wrong,

382
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,410
what?
He always screamed once.

383
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,960
It's all,
it's all about contrast.

384
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,520
Well,
he also didn't make fun of it.

385
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,830
You know,
he should have come on and he should

386
00:17:16,831 --> 00:17:19,710
have done something to make fun of it.
He should have had a speech where he

387
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:21,900
talked about,
so I got a little carried away folks.

388
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,160
You know,
like he,

389
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,300
he,
he hid from it.

390
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,330
It feels like he could have fixed that.
Yes.

391
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:28,080
Yeah,
I had that at the time.

392
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,110
Well,
if the problem was it was contrary to

393
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:34,830
what he was selling,
he was selling this buttoned up package

394
00:17:34,831 --> 00:17:37,350
deal.
And in the middle of that package deal

395
00:17:37,351 --> 00:17:40,500
is a fucking pro wrestling fans
screaming from a Suplex,

396
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:41,380
you know,
you know,

397
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,410
like Hulk Hogan Suplex is the iron
sheik.

398
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:46,110
And I mean that's what it was like.
I mean,

399
00:17:46,111 --> 00:17:48,180
that's not the guy who you want to have
the button.

400
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,980
So if you heard the studies,

401
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,770
uh,
I think this has been replicated,

402
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,710
it fairly reliable that if you want to
addict somebody to something,

403
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,420
let's say this year,
your Shell,

404
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,690
um,
if you gave them a really good product

405
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,990
every time,
it actually wouldn't be as addictive as

406
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:07,380
if once in a while it wasn't good and
they had to sorta like wait and

407
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:08,161
anticipate.
Oh,

408
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:09,830
there's that good one again.
Right?

409
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,750
So,
uh,

410
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,710
unpredictable rewards are far more
addicting,

411
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,720
unpredictable.
So,

412
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,790
uh,
Hillary Clinton who reward you every

413
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:20,460
time,
but it's just about the same is not

414
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:22,980
going to be nearly as addicting as
Donald Trump.

415
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:25,560
Who disappoints the fuck out of you.
You're like,

416
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:27,930
God,
I was just starting to like you.

417
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,460
Why did you say that that way?
Right?

418
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,180
And then two weeks later he comes out
with something,

419
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:34,110
you say,
Shit,

420
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,670
I love you again.
And you know,

421
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:38,370
so it's,
he's got that addictive pattern going.

422
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,970
Well I'll tell you what,
once all that grab the pussy stuff got

423
00:18:40,971 --> 00:18:42,420
out of the way.
Um,

424
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,220
he was doing a lot of speeches and the
rundown the last few days and I watched

425
00:18:46,221 --> 00:18:49,340
a few of them on television because I,
I've almost felt like even though I knew

426
00:18:49,341 --> 00:18:52,010
I was going to vote,
almost felt like some sort of a

427
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:56,840
spectator like this is,
this cannot possibly be real to speak to

428
00:18:56,841 --> 00:19:00,140
your software simulation idea in the
beginning that a lot of people share.

429
00:19:00,141 --> 00:19:02,450
By the way,
this is not just crazy Scott Adams and

430
00:19:02,451 --> 00:19:04,760
me,
but there's a lot of folks out there

431
00:19:04,761 --> 00:19:06,380
that think that we're living in a
simulation.

432
00:19:06,381 --> 00:19:09,470
Right?
But as he would give these speeches and

433
00:19:09,471 --> 00:19:12,500
there was some of his speeches he gave
where there was these moments,

434
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,530
are you like,
if someone could tell that guy to keep

435
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:18,680
it at seven,
like where he's at right there and talk

436
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:21,530
like that always and avoid all the crazy
shit.

437
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,160
But man,
the crazy shit is what you get.

438
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,940
Like that's,
that's the thing about people like trump

439
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
or like any powerful super dominator
type character like that.

440
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,680
Uh,
you don't have some flaws.

441
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,573
Lot of them.

442
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,840
Look what he kept saying all the time.
He was always saying he was the energy

443
00:19:40,841 --> 00:19:42,640
guy yesterday.
I look at my crowds.

444
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,650
The other one has no stamina.
This one's,

445
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:45,520
you know,
low energy.

446
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,910
Um,
he knew the facts didn't matter.

447
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,490
He knew the policy didn't matter.
And by the end,

448
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,950
I think everybody agrees they didn't,
