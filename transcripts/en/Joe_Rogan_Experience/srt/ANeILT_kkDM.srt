1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,420
Four,
three,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,950
two,
one.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,220
Ladies and gentlemen.
That's right.

4
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:09,000
Baby.
Uh,

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,460
headphones or no headphones.
Headphones.

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,890
Grab them right there.
Be a God damn professional,

7
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:15,980
sir.
That uh,

8
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:16,890
what,
where'd you get that?

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,350
Well,
I just noticed she,

10
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:23,870
like,
she answered herself up.

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,460
I'm very politically correct.
Yeah.

12
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,480
But she'd be like,
yeah,

13
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:26,960
sure.
I went in.

14
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:28,210
I batch.
I'm Jimmy Choo's.

15
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:28,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

16
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,230
Call my chef Darya.
And so she's like,

17
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,110
I think she spends a lot of time alone 
maybe.

18
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:37,830
And she's crazy answering or so what is 
going on with her voice?

19
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:39,710
Because she didn't have that voice when 
she was bruce.

20
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,880
It's a different voice,
is it?

21
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:44,790
I thought it was pretty similar.
It's like what's different?

22
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,980
It's will hire or something.
It's like numb.

23
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:52,310
Like her face is numb over in wash.

24
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,790
I thought she was.
I watched you.

25
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,290
Did you see her show?
I am cait.

26
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,780
She had like a reality show.
Which bob mean how much of a boring 

27
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:10,491
person you have to be.
When I think how interesting is like an 

28
00:01:10,491 --> 00:01:12,630
ex Olympic athlete turns into a woman 
and you're still boring still.

29
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:17,631
No one wants to see that show.
She needed a better producer.

30
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,650
Seems like I put her in.
Interesting situations is boring.

31
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,380
Like I watched it.
I tried to watch it.

32
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,490
It was boring.
God,

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,520
I feel like there's.
I just feel like they've missed a 

34
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:31,520
formula.
Look,

35
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,260
that is a fascinating situation.
Until they're 60 years old and then 

36
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,370
becomes a man.
Yeah.

37
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:38,670
How could that show not do well?
How could it?

38
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,350
I think what happened was she wasn't 
open about what her transition.

39
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:44,630
It wasn't about that.
Oh,

40
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,610
she didn't really talk about,
you know,

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,540
she,
she doesn't believe in gay marriage that

42
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,340
that's when I like,
I was on her side and they're like,

43
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,470
yeah,
she's a,

44
00:01:57,471 --> 00:01:58,340
you know,
why not?

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,570
I mean,
what,

46
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,960
how she said it more.
I'm kind of a traditional or not 

47
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,220
traditional girl shower.
Yeah.

48
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,460
Ellen is a very,
maybe one of the windiest very witty and

49
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:13,130
she went like this.
Well,

50
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,610
how she was completely lost for words 
because it's.

51
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,620
It makes no sense.
It's.

52
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:25,050
Well,
Ellen held their feet to the fire and 

53
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:25,050
they're big feet.
She,

54
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,190
she,
she burned those feet and I have my 

55
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,240
[inaudible] teen Jimmy Choo or the fire 
bribery of those custom,

56
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:31,090
right?
Oh yeah,

57
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:31,830
they'll,
we're around.

58
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:33,720
Sure.
I,

59
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:34,880
um,
you know,

60
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,450
for her to be against any group that 
she's been,

61
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,920
she knows what it feels like to be 
shunned or unbelievable.

62
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,650
It's just crazy.
She's just decided that she's a woman.

63
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,120
Yeah,
a Republican.

64
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,370
All lesbians grow.
But she's a lesbian now.

65
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,900
Yeah.
But now I date men bribery.

66
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,830
Does she?
He or she is dating a trans.

67
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,880
Jesus.
Okay.

68
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,320
What is happening?
Imagine if you were a man.

69
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,350
Okay.
And then you became a woman and you 

70
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:10,840
dated a woman who became a man.
What in the fuck is happening?

71
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:15,841
You're like,
you're like one of those Yin Yang 

72
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:15,841
spinning through space.
Yeah.

73
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:17,190
And then you're like,
gay marriage has grown.

74
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,400
Like I'm going to judge that.
It's,

75
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,530
it's,
they need to cut her brain open and 

76
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:25,810
figure out what's,
what's going on.

77
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,290
There's a lot of confusion and a lot of 
wanting to fit in.

78
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,730
A lot of,
you know,

79
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,280
it just doesn't make any sense.
And I really like people going through 

80
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,691
that.
And I don't want to hurt anyone's 

81
00:03:39,691 --> 00:03:39,691
feelings.
I just think she's.

82
00:03:39,691 --> 00:03:41,920
She's kind of an asshole.
Oh,

83
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,810
this is her boyfriend,
girlfriend.

84
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,500
So the girlfriend used to be a boy too?
Yes.

85
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,160
Fascinating.
That is.

86
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,840
Wow.
Wait a minute.

87
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,160
Girlfriend used to be a board.

88
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,530
That's what she used to look like.
Oh Christ.

89
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:56,920
The world is so strange.
And then she's like,

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,270
I just,
she's not a great person.

91
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,290
I mean she killed that lady with her car
and then said nothing like that was the 

92
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:07,840
weird.
You see the footage?

93
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,860
No,
she,

94
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:14,050
it's looks completely her fault.
She bumped into this lady who was 

95
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,600
stopped and the lady went across traffic
and died.

96
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,750
Yeah.
And no one talked about it like I was 

97
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:21,750
putting on my land.
Calm in the mirror.

98
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,740
Didn't share.
Is that what she said?

99
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,550
But she was looking at her phone.
I don't want to see this.

100
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,960
Oh,
I'm going to feel bad.

101
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:32,770
Yet some poor lady died and no one,
no one gives a fuck.

102
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:35,740
Because the story is not that.
The story is she's a woman now.

103
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,870
She's always been a woman.
She's always been a woman.

104
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,930
I mean,
it was good timing for her because 

105
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:43,390
people like ignored that and sort of 
went well.

106
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,330
It's crazy timing.
That was broche yeah.

107
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,010
The video that you did have that.
Why did you start doing these videos?

108
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,940
I'll tell you,
I was having like midlife crisis panic,

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,660
waking up at three in the morning,
like really moments.

110
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,040
I was writing for the show.
It was last year and it was great job.

111
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:08,041
Everyone's really nice and I like 
something in my subconscious felt like 

112
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:08,290
I,
I don't know,

113
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:12,490
like I had to get out and I,
I quit the job and I was like,

114
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,610
I'm just going to make videos on 
instagram.

115
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,090
Like what a,
what a great business move.

116
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,380
May Lose my health insurance and make 
videos for free on instagram.

117
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,210
Dude,
you have the funniest page on instagram.

118
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:31,270
I haven't seen them all,
but if all the ones I've seen without a 

119
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,270
doubt,
you have the funniest page.

120
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,260
I'll thank you very,
very much.

121
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:35,470
I mean I went because of you from like 
$20,000.

122
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,720

123
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,460
That's awesome.
You and uh,

124
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:41,380
you know,
in Thompson written well,

125
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,470
it's also like pumped it up.
It's just how good they are,

126
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:46,400
man.
It's one of the viral once,

127
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,480
once people watch a few of those do the 
one that you did where she was 

128
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,120
describing the different utensils that 
chooses to get herself off with the weed

129
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,530
whacker.
And Oh my gosh.

130
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,400
Tooth.
Oh yeah,

131
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,920
come on to help me out.
I gotta finish till when did you start 

132
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,480
doing the face swap thing?
Is it you're using your face to face 

133
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,920
swap app you can download and there's 
one for the trump.

134
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,380
I just,
I was doing trump at first night though.

135
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,470
Look anything like him.
So this was like a way to do character 

136
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:31,241
and have that clarity.
Trumps is stormy Daniels once epic.

137
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,400
Stormy.
How'd you get my number?

138
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:44,260
Oh,
the other one that made me cry was Kim 

139
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,460
Kardashian and trump what?
Kim couldn't figure out how to open up 

140
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,561
the door and wait for the buzzer.
There's the weird buzzing noise.

141
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,200
That's where your push it.
Oh,

142

uh,
those are um,

143
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,520
take so long.
I don't think anyone spend as much.

144
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,610
So I'm making videos for instagram.

145
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:05,960
Kim.
Okay.

146
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:08,750

Okay.

Okay.
Push it.

152
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,820

There was the weird thing,

153
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,370
the message that debates opened the 
door.

154
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,550
If you have to.
What?

155
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,360
You have to wait until a buzz.
You.

156
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,470
Jesus.
Great.

157
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,050
But I just got here.
No,

158
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:54,370
go in the door,
but I can't go in the door at the stolid

159
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,380
shit.
But

160
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,480
that would have been a lot funnier.
Biogenic.

161
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,350
Oh,
that's what I do with my time.

162
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,180
A grown man.
Yeah.

163
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,450
You're an actual full grown man.
I'm an old grown man.

164
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,030
I'm a man.
Boy.

165
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,030
So you really just decided to start 
doing these full time.

166
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,060
It just like,
it wasn't even like a brave decision or 

167
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,060
anything.
I really couldn't sleep.

168
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,861
I was having panic attacks that I was.
I think I saw my future and it was like 

169
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,080
I'm going to be a writer writing for 
people for the rest of my life.

170
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,460
You,
you get addicted to the money and the 

171
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:33,460
insurance and all that,
and it happens to so many comments.

172
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,420
It happens like I and I heard about it 
and I didn't see it coming and it just.

173
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,610
I suddenly woke up last summer,
I'm like,

174
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:43,611
I have to stop or I'll do this forever.
There are a few friends of mine who are 

175
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:48,221
really,
really funny comics and then can't work 

176
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:52,100
because they spent so many years doing 
sitcoms as a writer or doing sketch 

177
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,140
shows as a writer that they don't have a
following,

178
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,340
a following in the road,
but they're world class comedians.

179
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,620
Do you know Owen Smith?
Yeah,

180
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,160
he's fucking hilarious.
Nobody knows who he is.

181
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:05,820
I'm like,
dude,

182
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:07,470
you're one of the 20 best comics in the 
world.

183
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,750
It's crazy.
It doesn't make any nice guy.

184
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,820
Great Guy.
Ian Edwards.

185
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,280
Same Shit.
I mean more people known to Ian now than

186
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:16,760
before,
but God says,

187
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,650
trust me,
it's a fucking trap.

188
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,320
Only so much creative energy and if 
you're giving it to someone else,

189
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:25,230
you're done.
It's not just that you're tired all day,

190
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,200
you're stuck in an office and then you 
have to go on the road.

191
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:33,410
Like if you want to be a comic,
you have to do sets multiple times a 

192
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,140
week and you've got to go on the road.
That's just the way it is.

193
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,390
There's no way around it.
There's no other way to do it.

194
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,640
If you get in your fifties and you're 
not famous,

195
00:09:39,641 --> 00:09:40,960
you don't have a decent following.

196
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,210
Like you're,
you're fucked,

197
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,200
you're screwed,
you're fucked,

198
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,340
you're fucked and lets you run white.
Like Ron White got famous.

199
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,450
His late forties,
he was living in Mexico in his forties.

200
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,710
Oh really?
Done.

201
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:58,130
And then Jeff foxworthy contacted them 
and they started doing that blue collar 

202
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,661
comedy tour and boom.
Now he's got a private jet balling out 

203
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:02,661
of control.
Yeah.

204
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:03,600
Big Fat House in Beverly Hills.
Ooh,

205
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,660
sweet Rodney Dangerfield till.
Yeah.

206
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,300
Well he quit.
He quit doing standup was selling 

207
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,580
aluminum siding.
Oh,

208
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,350
that's right.
And then came back,

209
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,720
but the entire time he was away.
He was writing,

210
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:24,290
which is really crazy.
So he came back with a fuck load of 

211
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,261
material and also came back with a 
sharper style like came back more 

212
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:28,980
edited,
more precise.

213
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,940
Yeah.
You know,

214
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:32,220
and that's,
that's where it changed.

215
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,650
I feel like I can't believe how old I 
got.

216
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,860
Like you don't notice it if anyone's 
listening.

217
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,660
They're like in their twenties.
You don't get you.

218
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,680
I'm 40,
I just turned 47.

219
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,760
I'm 50.
Yeah,

220
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,410
you're further along than me career 
wise.

221
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:51,411
So I'm not as worried about you.
You don't wake up with night terrors 

222
00:10:51,411 --> 00:10:52,230
deal,
but you did,

223
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:53,370
Huh?
Yeah,

224
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,700
I really did.
When there are certain moments like you 

225
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:58,700
know,
you don't think about being old,

226
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,841
but like,
like when you put the date of birth in 

227
00:11:02,841 --> 00:11:06,770
online to buy something like that.
Scroll scrolling forever life going by.

228
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,110
You born in 70,
71?

229
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,550
Yeah.
That's a good year for cars.

230
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,240
You're the pig last good year for cars.
Is that true?

231
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,440
Yeah.
What about a tesla?

232
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,100
What do you hate?
Tests?

233
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:21,390
I don't know.
I mean muscle cars,

234
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,970
like my American muscle cars.
Yeah,

235
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,060
like the 19 sixties to the nine to 1971.
Nineteen 71 was essentially the last 

236
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:31,550
good year for cars.
We like Muslim ban.

237
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,920
Me and Joel both ripped,
but you know,

238
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,070
to share those classic American cars.

239
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,600
There was a few years where they were 
unbelievably cool and then after like 71

240
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,670
they fell apart.
So you just,

241
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,400
you caught it at the perfect time.
That's,

242
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:52,401
I mean that's what I'm known for.
Being born right at the end of the 

243
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:53,280
muscle cars.
Seventy one barracuda.

244
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,690
That was probably the last year.
A big car guy.

245
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,050
I love cars.
Yeah,

246
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,850
I do too,
but I drive a Honda civic because that's

247
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:02,590
what I could afford.
Well,

248
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:04,450
I had a Honda civic wants to.
Yeah.

249
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,880
Yeah.
They're great.

250
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,630
They start up every time you need them 
to.

251
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:10,090
Yeah.
I've had a fifth of their fucking shit.

252
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:12,060
Those cars.
Every time you put that in,

253
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,870
there's no confusion.
No problems,

254
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:15,640
no worries.
No anticipation.

255
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:16,330
Come on,
baby.

256
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:18,340
Come treated like crap.
It doesn't matter.

257
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,810
Those things are bulletproof.
Yeah.

258
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,960
They last forever.
And of Toyota's I have Alexis.

259
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,820
I love those things.
They never fuck up.

260
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,770
I'm on the waiting list for the Lexus.
Hm?

261
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,140
No,
I'm sorry.

262
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:30,040
Tesla.
Oh,

263
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:30,940
which one?
The three.

264
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,530
The new.
The cheaper one.

265
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,400
The three?
Yeah,

266
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,190
three.
Yeah.

267
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,690
But it's still like suspiciously 
expensive.

268
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,740
Do you see what's going on with Tesla 
and the formula employee,

269
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:46,741
some employee was,
was sabotaging code and a leaky 

270
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:49,060
information and now the employee is 
saying,

271
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:50,650
um,
that,

272
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,160
you know,
trying to say something about the Elon 

273
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,090
Musk was there was waste that he was a 
whistleblower.

274
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,310
He's not saying he's a saboteurs of 
whistleblower,

275
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,280
but they were saying he's a disgruntled 
employee because he owed money.

276
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:07,420
It's become this gigantic thing.
And Elon Musk is suing this guy stealing

277
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:10,090
code and then giving it the it.
No,

278
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,530
I don't know the exact specifics of it,
but he did something,

279
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,290
did something bad.
I Dunno.

280
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,020
We hate that guy when like,
oh,

281
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,550
well that car is like,
it's like it's 35 grand,

282
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,760
but if you want tires,
it's 45 to 75 grand.

283
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:30,860
Right?
Yeah.

284
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,270
You want a tesla,
you know?

285
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,740
Mm hmm.
I just need,

286
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,770
I need more.
I'm thinking,

287
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,100
think of it starting like a fun so I can
get a tesla.

288
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,740
You know,
people have like charity that go fund me

289
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,980
Patrion where you just commit to doing 
one of those videos every x amount of 

290
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,270
days.
I'm hearing about the.

291
00:13:47,271 --> 00:13:49,360
I got to get into the business side of 
things,

292
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,710
but a problem is creative people rarely 
are business minded.

293
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,370
I'm spending like $4 a month on just 
phone calls.

294
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:59,740
I'm not making to like a t and t and 
stuff.

295
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,990
I need to like get get my business side 
in order.

296
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,980
What do you mean?
I know you keep,

297
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,390
you'll get a subscription to something 
you don't use anymore and then you 

298
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:12,390
don't.
You can't figure out how to cancel it.

299
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:12,390
Like,
oh,

300
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,030
that's happening in my life.

301
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,980
Oh Man.
That's what they.

302
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,570
That's what they want.
Yeah,

303
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:21,810
they're good at that.
I want to make it difficult for you to 

304
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:21,810
quit.
He had like,

305
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:21,810
they'll go,
hey,

306
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,321
have these vitamins.
You get one month free and then before 

307
00:14:25,321 --> 00:14:29,281
you get the vitamins you have to cancel 
in order to stop the next month from 

308
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:29,281
being charged.
Is them saying,

309
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:30,350
Oh,
you know,

310
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,960
I'm like,
I'm up on my guitar right now.

311
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,250
Let's move on.
Sorry.

312
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,180
No,
it's okay.

313
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,040
I get it.
Yeah.

314
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,580
So when you do these videos,
um,

315
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,890
how many,
how many hours do you think are involved

316
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,690
in like,
like the Kanye one,

317
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,080
the one,
the most recent,

318
00:14:45,081 --> 00:14:47,110
which is fucking hilarious.
Thank you.

319
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:50,590
I um,
I've gotten quicker at them but it still

320
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:50,980
takes

321
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,240
uh,
inordinate amount of time probably 

322
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,270
because there's like I get the idea,
nick,

323
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:01,350
I'll write something quick and then I'll
sleep on it and then I'll go work on a 

324
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,741
little more.
Try to edit it down because you want to 

325
00:15:04,741 --> 00:15:07,151
make it like pretty tight with like 
online people don't want a minute of 

326
00:15:07,151 --> 00:15:09,120
fluff or anything.
So you got to go quick.

327
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,590
Yeah.
And the actual process of,

328
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,590
of getting them to talk,
I'll take the person who talks the most,

329
00:15:13,591 --> 00:15:18,591
like if it's Caitlin and I'll,
I'll film that and I'll have the whole 

330
00:15:18,591 --> 00:15:22,050
script written out so as I feel it in my
mouth all talk the other words.

331
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,080
So the timing is kind of close to that.
And then I'll send that video to myself 

332
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,791
to my airdrop it to my laptop and turn 
it really low and then I'll do the next 

333
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:35,190
character and have that playing so I can
have that sinked up.

334
00:15:35,191 --> 00:15:40,191
Right.
And I compare those to do the next 

335
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:40,191
person like that.
Whoa.

336
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:41,280
Get a lot of time on my hands.
Yeah.

337
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,130
But I'm only 47.
So.

338
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,960
So what was the thought process when you
quit?

339
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:48,020
You just couldn't do it.
You had to,

340
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:48,830
you had to get out.

341
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,360
Yeah.
I,

342
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,880
I just um,
something was the,

343
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:56,750
like a panicking it,
this was I think seeing my life and I,

344
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,900
I want to at least try to be like a 
performers.

345
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,080
Why?
What I wanted to do,

346
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:06,150
I can't even read very well.
And being a writer to me is um,

347
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,460
it's not as fun.
I mean,

348
00:16:08,461 --> 00:16:10,870
if I didn't have the experience before 
and like,

349
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,430
um,
I don't think I feel this way,

350
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,260
it's just I got a taste,
you know,

351
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:20,261
I had some stuff that I did that I 
really enjoyed it just,

352
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,220
I think I just saw the,

353
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,300
the trappings of it.
Well,

354
00:16:24,301 --> 00:16:26,370
some people are really good writers in 
the,

355
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:28,950
that's what they want to do,
that's all they want to do.

356
00:16:28,951 --> 00:16:33,951
They don't want to perform.
But the problem with being a good 

357
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:33,951
performer is sometimes you can help 
other people out.

358
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,410
Like,
Hey,

359
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:39,470
if you just tighten this up here and 
maybe if you just explain this a little 

360
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,240
better,
it would work better and you know,

361
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:40,690
you,
you,

362
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,700
you,
you start writing,

363
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,110
next thing you know,
hey,

364
00:16:43,111 --> 00:16:44,520
would you work on my show?
Sure.

365
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:49,890
Then you're there in the office and 
you're got a corkboard and you're 

366
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:50,730
putting index cards up and you're like,
oh my God,

367
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,710
yeah.
And then I'll get that check every week.

368
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:53,090
And you're like,
oh,

369
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,290
it's a nice check.
Sweet.

370
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,710
And I,
I'm really thankful for those jobs.

371
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:59,660
And they were,
they were really great and I,

372
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,390
you know,
I have a house and stuff,

373
00:17:01,391 --> 00:17:03,190
but uh,
yeah,

374
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:07,280
this is like last power drive I think.
Fuck it.

375
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:12,250
If this doesn't work out with Instagram,
I mean just this though,

376
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,830
I'm really excited because now I can do 
little theaters.

377
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:19,831
Like the draw directly from instagram 
has enabled me to like get out of clubs 

378
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:23,950
and stuff,
so it worked and I feel the audience,

379
00:17:23,951 --> 00:17:27,990
like I just had chosen San Francisco and
it's such a difference when the audience

380
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:32,991
knows what you do and who you are 
instead of like having to take them 

381
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:33,070
through.

382
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:38,030
Well you might be one of the only guys 
that's done it that way though,

383
00:17:38,031 --> 00:17:41,150
through characters in little short one 
minute videos.

384
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,940
Yeah.
Because I really,

385
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,840
I started off with that but then there 
was no money in sketch really,

386
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,930
you know,
and so I got into standup,

387
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,160
I needed to make

388
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,330
money and so I never felt standup was 
what I did the best.

389
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:59,331
But now I feel like I'm getting a little
better at stand up and I'm actually 

390
00:17:59,331 --> 00:18:02,571
enjoying it more now.
But it characters and impressions is 

391
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:03,750
when you do shows,
do you ever play videos?

392
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,400
Do you play that?
You did a show?

393
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:10,401
I have a show at Largo that I do like 
every couple months and I did show 

394
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:11,040
videos.
It was the owner's idea.

395
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,820
Um,
and that was really fun.

396
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,580
It's a great idea.
Yeah.

397
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,420
Especially if you make some videos 
specific to the show.

398
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,400
That's exactly.
I didn't do that,

399
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:24,400
but,
but watching,

400
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,860
I was like,
that's what I should do.

401
00:18:25,861 --> 00:18:29,550
Like have trumpy like next step guys,
ethic or whatever.

402
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,360
Yeah,
yeah.

403
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,430
Having the host.
Yeah,

404
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,840
yeah.
Yeah.

405
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:34,950
And then,
you know,

406
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,280
have a tailwind,
generous take on different things and 

407
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:40,280
just,
you know,

408
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,220
Caitlin's tips.
CAITLIN's.

409
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,200
I did a thing where she,
I brought her out,

410
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,910
like in between as she's working on a 
one person show was just the idea,

411
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,880
like the greatest love and when had the 
like audience surfed,

412
00:18:56,881 --> 00:18:57,570
it was really fun.

413
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:05,850
Oh yeah.
I mean you could do easily like some 

414
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,990
sort of a multimedia presentation type 
thing.

415
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,780
Yeah.
It seems like it would be a really great

416
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:10,340
idea.
Yeah.

417
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:15,410
I'm trying to put together something 
[inaudible] to do like some kind of 

418
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:15,960
special.
Yeah.

419
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,880
Fuck yeah.
Yeah.

420
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,660
Just sandwich bits in between,
you know,

421
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,190
like to do some stand up and go,
you know,

422
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,780
and you know,
like,

423
00:19:24,781 --> 00:19:25,650
you know,
I wonder,

424
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,580
I wonder what stormy Daniels would do or
you know,

425
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,150
just anything.
I mean,

426
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:35,151
any weird way the community decide to 
transition.

427
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,370
What did you get the story?
Daniel's voice is.

428
00:19:37,371 --> 00:19:40,440
It sounded anything like,
I have no idea how she thought.

429
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,370
She was like,
Beth,

430
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:46,570
oh,
I can't wait to get your cock in my 

431
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,221
mouth again when she's calling.
She actually sounds nothing like that.

432
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,330
I'm sure.
Yeah.

433
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,270
But it doesn't matter,
but she seemed like she was like,

434
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:01,130
oh my God.
There was one that you did that look 

435
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,290
like your face.
You jerrod cushner.

436
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,340
Was that it?
Like me.

437
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,130
He's like,
um,

438
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,980
but all of our face swap.
None of them are you.

439
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,190
I do a character craig.
That's like,

440
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,630
oh,
that guy with the glasses.

441
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

442
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,190
Checking Matt.

443
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,010
That's my real mom.
Probably know that.

444
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,940
Really?
Yeah.

445
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:24,960
Oh,
that's hilarious.

446
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,390
She's a good actress.
The first take,

447
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,450
she didn't know what I was doing and 
that was like real and honest.

448
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:31,940
But after that,
like I told,

449
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,150
she knew she was acting.
She seems very good.

450
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:41,190
Yeah.
It seems like you're annoying the shit 

451
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:41,190
out of your mom.
Yeah.

452
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:41,190
It's very funny.
Yeah.

453
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,590
So when you decided to do this,
there's no.

454
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,820
I mean,
unless you're a hot chick selling 

455
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:48,820
whatever,
what do they sell?

456
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,520
Sunglasses,
assumptions,

457
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,950
makeup detoxes.
Skinny tea detox.

458
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,080
Kenny t?
Yeah.

459
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:58,130
Unless you're.
I've never made a fucking penny off of 

460
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:58,820
instagram.
I mean that you have it either will.

461
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,190
I've actually just ticket sales I guess.
Right?

462
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,510
Yeah.
But yeah,

463
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:02,810
I haven't

464
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,290
monetized or I haven't been thinking 
about that.

465
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,750
I just Kinda,
I feel good if people like,

466
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:13,751
it just makes me feel like at some 
purpose or something that I feel like 

467
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:17,471
I've done something and I'm building.
If I could build an audience and to come

468
00:21:18,171 --> 00:21:20,120
to my shows,
I'll be really happy about that.

469
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,610
So you were

470
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,980
doing mostly clubs before and now you're
moving into theaters.

471
00:21:24,981 --> 00:21:29,981
Is that what's going on?
And this is all over the last months 

472
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:29,981
from instagram.

473
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:30,500
That's incredible.
It is.

474
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:33,380
So it worked it here's success story.
Well,

475
00:21:33,381 --> 00:21:36,110
I mean it's working.
It's working.

476
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:36,950
Yeah.

477
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,190
That's fucking great.
It's really exciting.

478
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:44,191
And thank you again.
I mean I might share my personal Santa 

479
00:21:44,191 --> 00:21:44,191
Claus Dude,
my fucking whole family.

480
00:21:44,191 --> 00:21:46,870
So sick of watching your video.
My wife got angry,

481
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:48,370
the other,
she was in the toilet and I was like,

482
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:49,620
just watch.
I opened the door,

483
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,850
go watch this,
watch this one,

484
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:57,290
watch this one.
Because with the Kanye West when I was 

485
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:57,290
crying,
she's like,

486
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:57,290
what the fuck are you laughing at?
And I was like,

487
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:01,060
watch this.
Just watch this by worst impression,

488
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,800
but the fuck up.
Amazing.

489
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,000
It was amazing when,
when Caitlin's like,

490
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,890
shut the fuck up cam.
He's a junior.

491
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,900
Can check genius at work.
Can.

492
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,890
Oh,
oh.

493
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,260
The other one.
The other one about the baby died in her

494
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:20,150
womb.
Which triggers.

495
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,520
Yeah,
I'm pregnant.

496
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,740
Too babyish.
Could breathe in the room.

497
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,660
Yeah.
Shabnam up my new badge.

498
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,400
Dad.
Do you have a womb?

499
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:29,800
Let me go.
Crap.

500
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:34,801
They shout probably Gad,
but then they go immediately to the 

501
00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:34,801
lipstick.

502
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,700
Ugh.
Ugh.

503
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:42,610
It's just so perfect because like 
instagram,

504
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:46,960
it's almost like you have optimized 
instagram better than anybody.

505
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,090
You really have nailed it.
You've nailed it.

506
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:54,091
For comedy.
It was everybody else like mine 

507
00:22:54,091 --> 00:22:54,091
included.
If you would go to my instagram,

508
00:22:54,091 --> 00:22:56,460
you have to fucking dig to find out.
I'm a comedian and you got to go looking

509
00:22:56,461 --> 00:22:57,430
around.
You can,

510
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,560
you know,
you can find anything there.

511
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:02,120
All kinds of stuff.
I take a picture.

512
00:23:02,121 --> 00:23:03,520
I find a picture.
I think it's cool.

513
00:23:03,521 --> 00:23:08,521
I put it up there.
There's no rhyme or reason to yours is 

514
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:08,521
like a show,
like your instagram page.

515
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,550
Kyle Duncan one.

516
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,740
You got to go to wash my neck.
There was a kyle,

517
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,050
Donnie.
He's gotten all my gmail accounts.

518
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:21,051
Who?
He grabbed everything and I asked my 

519
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:21,051
nephew.
I'm like,

520
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:21,090
what?
Because over Christmas I'm like,

521
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,160
I'm just going to do instagram videos 
and see what happens.

522
00:23:23,161 --> 00:23:24,870
And I was like,
what should I do different?

523
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:26,910
And he's like,
she take the one out.

524
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:30,380
Stupid kids ones are.
Yeah,

525
00:23:30,381 --> 00:23:32,160
it's stupid.
Why'd you and change it now?

526
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,370
How about the Real Chi?
I don't.

527
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,620
That's the thing.
Marketing's not my thing though.

528
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,960
I am kyle done again.
That's another one.

529
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:41,890
That's another one.
People do call on in comedy.

530
00:23:41,891 --> 00:23:43,860
It would have been fun.
That's a good one.

531
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,530
But it's a lot of words.
A of letters.

532
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:46,100
Yeah.

533
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,520
It's A.
I think instagram,

534
00:23:47,521 --> 00:23:50,120
just like in my wheelhouse,
like I like to edit.

535
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,130
I like to do quick,
you know stuff.

536
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,660
No,
it's perfect.

537
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:59,250
But your channel,
your page is like a channel unlike most 

538
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,580
people's instagram pages and treat it 
like a show.

539
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,780
Yeah.
It is like a show.

540
00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:04,290
It's almost like you should have a 
regular.

541
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,500
I'm that you shouldn't even.
He'd just keep doing what you're doing 

542
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,910
because you don't have videos now for 
Instagram TV.

543
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,950
You could go up to an hour.
Oh yeah,

544
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:17,980
that's right.
But I think what he's doing is perfect 

545
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:17,980
instagram TV.
Yeah,

546
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,380
it's a new thing.
Just came out.

547
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,640
Oh boy.
Oh boy.

548
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,700
I just got a panic attack.
Thinking about doing an hour of Caitlin 

549
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:24,860
for an hour.

550
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,820
40th five more.
Manage everybody.

551
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,580
Fuck.
Oh Shit.

552
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,610
I just spilled coffee all over the 
studio.

553
00:24:36,611 --> 00:24:39,050
It's okay.
You're not going to do it all the time.

554
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,570
No laptops or anywhere near killed a 
bunch of laptops,

555
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,770
man.
Nothing about Mac.

556
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,460
That pisses me off.
Guess what,

557
00:24:49,461 --> 00:24:51,110
Lenovo?
You spill on it.

558
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,330
Nothing happens.
Nothing.

559
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,990
They make them waterproof.
Then make them dust resistant.

560
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,170
They make a mil SPEC.
We need to spill on them.

561
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:02,060
You could throw a glass of water in the 
keyboard.

562
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:05,390
Not a goddamn thing happens.
You put one on apple.

563
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,220
They just tell you,
nope,

564
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:08,210
you're gonna.
Need a new one new one.

565
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,360
Blow on it.
We need a lot more napkins.

566
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,940
It's okay.
If you sneeze on it,

567
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:15,980
it'll.
It'll blow out.

568
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,560
Sons of bitches want to go grab some 
Napkins.

569
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,940
Hey,
grab a couple of those.

570
00:25:19,941 --> 00:25:21,310
Kill cliffs,
those line ones.

571
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,670
I'm very uncoordinated.
Dude.

572
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,370
You're not this.
I do this all the time.

573
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,490
I'm pretty coordinated and I fucking 
spill coffee and here all the time.

574
00:25:31,491 --> 00:25:31,920
It's,
you know,

575
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,970
it's your microphone's in front of you.
Start moving your hands.

576
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:41,090
I'm a fucking.
This is your,

577
00:25:42,181 --> 00:25:43,580
uh,
what is your background?

578
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,170
Mostly Italian.
One quarter.

579
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:46,550
Irish.
I'm the same thing.

580
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:49,810
Shut the people are cool.
It's crazy.

581
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,650
Twenty three and me.
I did that now,

582
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:56,651
but I'm doing it right now and I'm doing
a bit about it because I'm secretly 

583
00:25:56,651 --> 00:25:57,560
hoping that someone in my past has sex 
with a black person.

584
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:02,770
I have,
I'm hoping two point seven percent 

585
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,180
really nice,
but I think it's northern African.

586
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,210
Let's,
I'll take it,

587
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:11,290
I'll take it and I'm going to run with 
it and it'll open up a whole new realm 

588
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:11,290
of material.

589
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:17,680
Just bring your 23 and me and it's going
to start shitting on white people.

590
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,770
So hard to be a white guy.
That's the hardest thing to be.

591
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,810
So polite,
man.

592
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,120
She had no one to blame.
So always.

593
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,200
That's true.
It's your fault,

594
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,140
but it's also the easiest thing to be.
Of course.

595
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,170
I'm just kidding.
I know,

596
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:31,820
I know.
You're kidding.

597
00:26:31,821 --> 00:26:33,350
You don't have to say you're kidding.
You're fucking comedian.

598
00:26:33,351 --> 00:26:36,110
How dare you.
You're still cleaning.

599
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,100
You don't have to clean anymore,
man.

600
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,140
I'm still cleaning teeth.
The thing is,

601
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:41,570
the more coffee that's on this table,
the better it looks.

602
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,990
It's going to smell good.
Yeah,

603
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,270
weathered.

604
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,680
This is a weather table.
Give me that.

605
00:26:46,681 --> 00:26:48,510
I'll chuck chuck that the garbage.
All right,

606
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,630
thanks.
This.

607
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,840
This coffee has character or this table 
rather character high maintenance.

608
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,100
No,
you're fine dude.

609
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:01,790
So you got to have some measure of 
satisfaction that this moment that you 

610
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:06,120
had that cause he.
I love stories like that because you had

611
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:08,340
this moment where you're like,
I can't,

612
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,010
I gotta do something,
I can't do this anymore.

613
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,170
And then you did.
And it worked.

614
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,030
Yeah.
I,

615
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:20,050
I'm really,
I'm sleeping a lot better and you know,

616
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,940
I had,
you know,

617
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:24,450
been in this business for a long time 
and there's been so many.

618
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,500
I mean,
I could talk for hours about the 

619
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:29,500
disappointments,
but I still feel lucky,

620
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,060
you know,
that it got,

621
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:35,140
you know,
I was able to like make a living or 

622
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:35,140
whatever.
But uh,

623
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,270
there's some luck involved.
I mean,

624
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:41,330
I was lucky you came across it and um,
I've had so many.

625
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,910
I wish I knew who told me about you.
I wish I could remember.

626
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,920
It might've been Tom.
Tom,

627
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,620
yeah.
Tom Was Tom.

628
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,660
He was pretty.
It was a comic.

629
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,880
Pretty sure it was a comic.
It might've been Tom.

630
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,240
He was the first one to host one of 
mine.

631
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,610
Think maybe that's what it was.
I did this show.

632
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,330
Oh,
I,

633
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:05,340
I won't go into it,
but let's just say I have so many 

634
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:05,340
disasters.
Don't write thought.

635
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,900
I was like,
get ready for the rocket ship Kyle,

636
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,440
go the shopping because things were 
about to take off and just always 

637
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,380
something.
I did this Jamie Fox,

638
00:28:16,381 --> 00:28:21,381
like a sketch show pilot and it took to 
get up a part on a network show.

639
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:29,420
It's a lot of auditions if you climb a 
mountain to get the role and I was like,

640
00:28:30,661 --> 00:28:35,661
feeling this is my last shot and 
everything and I got there and we 

641
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:35,661
couldn't.

642
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:36,510
We weren't allowed to write for 
ourselves.

643
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,730
Blood is a wga rolls or something and 
you know,

644
00:28:38,731 --> 00:28:41,520
you have a character.
No one else can really write for it.

645
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:47,300
And the people that were writing,
two of them just got out of prison and 

646
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,220
they were not comedy writers.
Jamie is a huge career.

647
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:52,320
He didn't really.
He just was like,

648
00:28:52,321 --> 00:28:57,321
let me get my friends this because I got
all this other stuff going on and he 

649
00:28:57,321 --> 00:28:57,321
didn't give a fuck.
I need it now.

650
00:28:57,321 --> 00:28:58,850
He would show up like once a week.
No.

651
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,960
Yeah.
Really?

652
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,020
Yeah,
he's busy.

653
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:06,021
I need to come in.
He come in with glasses like Shay and 

654
00:29:06,021 --> 00:29:09,341
we'd go and we'd read the script and 
there'd be no ending or seemingly point 

655
00:29:09,341 --> 00:29:11,310
and then one time he threw the script 
and there was like,

656
00:29:11,311 --> 00:29:12,720
fuck that script.
Do you,

657
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,770
you do you,
you know,

658
00:29:13,771 --> 00:29:15,210
when he walked out and the executives 
were like,

659
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,030
no,
you can't do.

660
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,840
It was like,
that was like,

661
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:21,060
he climbed this mountain,
there's an Arby's at the top,

662
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,910
just like the thing that was going to 
be.

663
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,850
These writers called me into their 
office once and they were like,

664
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,950
yeah,
we have this idea for these,

665
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,190
these guys who never wrote a sketch 
before.

666
00:29:32,191 --> 00:29:33,870
And they were like,
this idea that you're,

667
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,870
you're Jimmy by James Bond,
you're Jimmy Bond,

668
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,230
all right.
And you're,

669
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,330
you're in an airplane.
Right?

670
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,010
And like to take it,
take it.

671
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,070
And the next day I'd be like,
yeah,

672
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,300
and you owe like a soda,
like a,

673
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:48,390
like a,
like a coca cola or sprite or like a 

674
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,140
point that I got to get a mountain dew,
mountain dew or Die Co.

675
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,190
And I'm like,
uh huh.

676
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:56,191
And then that was It.
I just was sitting there dead silence 

677
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:03,460
and then we had like this show which 
came out very mediocre was what was it 

678
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,140
called?

679
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:10,710
It was called into flow.
It got changed to something else and it 

680
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,500
just became like,
it was a fee on crockett's show.

681
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,900
I was like a hot,
like a cast member or whatever.

682
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,360
And then at the end,
you know,

683
00:30:16,361 --> 00:30:19,870
fox pays all this millions of dollars 
and a few hands going,

684
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:25,450
all fox cares about is their wallets,
but we showed them not realizing we had 

685
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:29,431
to wait for a pickup and I'm just 
standing on stage thinking this is my 

686
00:30:29,431 --> 00:30:32,350
last shot to have anything because I was
already like 40 and I just was like,

687
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:38,970
let me go to the wrap party.
And the whole thing was just me and 

688
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,970
eric.
Andre is on it too.

689
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,170
Okay.
So we just were like,

690
00:30:44,171 --> 00:30:49,171
what is Happening?
And we go late to the wrap party and we 

691
00:30:49,241 --> 00:30:54,241
walk into this nice restaurant and jamie
foxx is standing up and into the whole 

692
00:30:54,241 --> 00:30:55,990
one big table and he was going down.
WhAt's your favorite animal?

693
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:59,130
What's your favorite animal?
It was like a rabbit,

694
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,530
like everyone.
Just those.

695
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,700
What's your second favorite animal?
What's your second favorite animal is 

696
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,750
terrifying to fuck.
Yeah,

697
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,280
and he goes,
he goes,

698
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:16,300
the first animals who you think you are 
the second animals who you really are.

699
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,540
I told tom cruise that.
He saId it was awesome.

700
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:23,230
Anyway,
it's instagram.

701
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,890
Yeah,
I have a.

702
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:30,760
I'm going to write a book one day.
I just called humiliated stories.

703
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,820
A long career of ground balls.
I've,

704
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,210
I've had so many like why really was 
going shopping for houses,

705
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:43,300
had to stop several.
Like I had this pizza hut campaign which

706
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:48,301
was like get ready to like open up 
several bank accounts and it was like 

707
00:31:48,851 --> 00:31:53,700
the big new yorker pizza and you know,
there's an explosion of flavors as we're

708
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,550
shooting nine slash.
This is a campaign of videos.

709
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,190
Nine slash 11 happened as,
as we're shooting the explosion.

710
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,760
It was just the wrong vibe to be like,
hey,

711
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:08,761
New York,
a big explosion of flavor is this whole 

712
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:09,160
thing.
And so they canceled the whole thing.

713
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,280
They played like,
I don't know if like a month they played

714
00:32:12,281 --> 00:32:14,530
a few and then they like dropped it,
but he was like,

715
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,070
you know,
it was I shot for,

716
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,620
I got paid pretty well,
but we're going to do six more.

717
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:24,340
It was going to be like one of those 
flow from progressive pizza hut.

718
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,530
Guy of subway.
Yeah.

719
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,670
For pizza hut.
Yeah.

720
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,920
That you were going to be the verizon.
Can you hear me now,

721
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,830
guy?
That's what I was waiting for.

722
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:34,210
That trust that guy anymore.
No,

723
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:35,180
I don't.
Please switch to.

724
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,420
where's he at now?
Sprint.

725
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,620
That's not cool.
Yeah,

726
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,980
I don't hear you as well.

727
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:45,290
My,
my mother walked into pizza hut ones 

728
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,430
while this campaign was happening and 
she just pointed at me.

729
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,880
She was my,
my,

730
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:53,940
my son's pizza hut.
Oh.

731
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:01,760
And I had to tell them I'm,
I'm actually not pizza hut anyway,

732
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,700
so I feel lucky.
But,

733
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:08,240
but uh,
but you found the thing like,

734
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,270
look dude,
you're fucking videos made me howl.

735
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,980
They're really,
really funny.

736
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,620
Like that's you,
you for whatever it is.

737
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:20,650
The way your mind works.
It works best for these face swap 

738
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,510
videos.
Which,

739
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,960
which is fucked up man,
because it didn't exist until.

740
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,430
When was it?
Two years?

741
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,600
How long ago?
How many years ago?

742
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:32,660
Three years ago.
I remember I'm the first person I ever 

743
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,060
saw use it was chris delea.
Taleah was.

744
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:38,270
He did some video where he was rick from
the walking dead and he put it on his 

745
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,060
instagram page.
I was like,

746
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:40,350
wow.
I'm like,

747
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,210
obviously I can tell something's going 
on,

748
00:33:42,211 --> 00:33:44,640
but that's amazing how close that is.
Yeah.

749
00:33:44,641 --> 00:33:48,810
I was excited right away because I knew 
that the impressions that I do,

750
00:33:48,811 --> 00:33:53,811
I don't look like most of them.
To your trump is fucking phenomenal and 

751
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:57,501
when you do it with that wacky fade,
the one face that you picked for the 

752
00:33:57,501 --> 00:33:59,430
face wipes so perfect because it looks 
like he's out of control.

753
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,300
Crazy.
Jesus.

754
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,000
That's fucking amazing,
man.

755
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,710
It's amazing.
Did you see the.

756
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,010
What's going on today?
Tom arnold,

757
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:16,070
who hates trump,
has a new show on vIce or he's just 

758
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:19,821
running around trying to find 
incriminating video and audio w on 

759
00:34:19,821 --> 00:34:21,050
trumbull.
That's all he's done.

760
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:25,890
The whole show is him on a quest to find
incriminating and humiliating video.

761
00:34:25,891 --> 00:34:29,190
And audio and trump.
And he was with Michael Cohen today.

762
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,770
What?
Yes.

763
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:35,870
How could he.
Michael cohen is apparently going to 

764
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,840
work with tom arnold on the show.
Oh,

765
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,810
is he?
Is the fbi okay with that?

766
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,540
I think they were together.
This photo.

767
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:43,310
I mean tom arnold could be just 
bullshitting.

768
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,640
well,
I'm tv knowing that that's coming out.

769
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:51,160
You're stIll tivo going.
Why don't you just get out the vcr?

770
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:56,690
Do know how to work the client.
Now I have things come out of my mouth 

771
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,160
where it shows my.
What is this jamie on his twitter.

772
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:03,860
This is tom arnold.
Did the miss universe tape is another 

773
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,380
tape talking about 16 year old girls in 
their underwear here.

774
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:12,360
The celebrity apprentice.
Trump.

775
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,010
Denies any involvement with

776
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:16,810
cute.

777
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,900
Don't worry tom arnold.
Tom arnold

778
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,680
for the trump tapes with tom arnold.

779
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,220
I mean,
no one's going to care no matter what.

780
00:35:29,221 --> 00:35:30,670
He uh,
no.

781
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,010
It's not going to have an effect.
Probably.

782
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,410
Listen.
Fuck john gotti.

783
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:37,800
Trump is a teflon done.
You see that movie?

784
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:38,080
they're

785
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,670
saying they scammed rotten tomatoes.
Would that move those to be the greatest

786
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:47,030
movie of all time will get a zero credit
80 from the audience and like 90 percent

787
00:35:48,031 --> 00:35:53,031
where it was from like their employees 
thinking that correction on the michael.

788
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,770
Wow.
When was that taken as a correction?

789
00:35:55,771 --> 00:35:58,050
Some sort of correction it.
He didn't say.

790
00:35:58,051 --> 00:36:01,500
Me and him were teaming up to take down 
Donald Trump.

791
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:06,530
Michael has enough trump on his plate.
I'm the crazy person who said me and 

792
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,460
Michael Cohen,
we're teaming up to take down trump.

793
00:36:08,461 --> 00:36:10,260
Of course.
I meant it.

794
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,710
Michael doesn't get paid by vice.
Okay.

795
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,350
Thank you tom,
for correcting the record.

796
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,370
Thanks for clearing that up.
Bam.

797
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,420
That's what I feel like he was.
Tom arnold.

798
00:36:24,421 --> 00:36:26,680
I'd be nervous as fuck.
Why?

799
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,550
I don't want to get killed.
Oh,

800
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,130
now.
Impossible.

801
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,200
Impossible.
You can't kill tom.

802
00:36:34,201 --> 00:36:36,450
Arnold would have putin did it for a 
favor.

803
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:41,600
Poot and might be able to do it.
Put some little decides I don't like.

804
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:45,000
We'll do.
Doing what could you have done?

805
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:47,460
This is not that good.
The russian accent.

806
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:51,420
Would you consider doing a poo on your 
page?

807
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,490
I will,
yes.

808
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,440
That's a good idea.
It's a great idea.

809
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,110
Let's use the lotion that has these 
little.

810
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:00,330
Shouldn't this good?
It's not bad.

811
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:05,500
just do it.
Just listen to him talk a few times and 

812
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:05,500
you'd.
You'd get it.

813
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,020
I'm putting good and then a bunch of 
like really harsh russian prostitutes.

814
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:14,190
Like water flying squirrels.

815
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,530
That's it.
Next week.

816
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:25,040
Yeah.
I mean that's not a bad idea for a 

817
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,691
sketch.
Is there a piece of tape or is that a 

818
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:29,100
that a rumor or do we not know this?
I don't know.

819
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,680
I don't think it's supposed to be real.
Think it's supposed to be fake.

820
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:32,910
I.
It sounds fake.

821
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,760
It sounds like something someone would 
just make up,

822
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,400
like not even well planned out.
Who?

823
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,460
How many?
What percentage of people like to be 

824
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:43,460
peed on?
It's got to be below one percent.

825
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,140
That's still a lot.
It's 300 million people.

826
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:51,141
That means 3 million people or to get 
peed on just in this country alone.

827
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:56,220
That's a lot of cleanup.
I don't even think it's one perCent,

828
00:37:56,221 --> 00:37:58,710
but even if it's one 10th of one percent
is 300,000

829
00:37:58,711 --> 00:37:59,610
people.
Like,

830
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:04,611
I love a chocolate sundae,
but if you smeared it all over the 

831
00:38:04,611 --> 00:38:08,271
place,
then after I had to clean up I'd 

832
00:38:08,271 --> 00:38:08,271
probably back.
You know,

833
00:38:08,271 --> 00:38:11,360
I'm not into that.
I think it's a freakish thing you're 

834
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,500
into.
I'm surprisingly team.

835
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:18,560
I'm not in anything freaky.
I've never even done like whipped cream 

836
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,071
or anything hot about.
When a gIrl asks you to choke her a 

837
00:38:22,071 --> 00:38:22,830
little,
how do you feel about that?

838
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,130
Um,
that's a scary.

839
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:28,080
It requests.
I'm not into that.

840
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,190
I'm not.
Um,

841
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,730
I had a girl that I used to date who 
wanted me to rape her.

842
00:38:32,731 --> 00:38:36,040
She told me the raper that's hmm,
that's

843
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,910
tough and problem with she was fucking 
hot and I was like,

844
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,060
I do not want to get interested in doing
this.

845
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:47,590
Like the worst thing would be you really
liked that because I was in my twenties.

846
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:52,650
What if,
what if I just had it came after I got 

847
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,580
into like only girls that want you to 
like force them to do shit.

848
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,650
That's,
that's very true.

849
00:38:56,651 --> 00:38:59,230
When you are young and you're forming 
your sexuality,

850
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,030
whatever,
you first got your.

851
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,920
Like when I first dance with a girl and 
I noticed her hips were wide,

852
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:11,300
I,
I got like a boner and there's like an 

853
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,531
eighth grade because it was like this is
different and it linked and four years 

854
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:20,130
till I was in my early thirties I could 
not dance with a girl without getting a 

855
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,750
hard on.
I was at a wedding once and I asked this

856
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:27,751
girl to death like I never do this,
but she was alone and she was hot and I 

857
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:31,821
get on the dance sport,
my mother's there and I got like a 

858
00:39:31,821 --> 00:39:34,891
boner,
I don't know this girl at all and I had 

859
00:39:34,891 --> 00:39:35,050
to tell her because,
you know,

860
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,420
you know,
like your wedding pants are,

861
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,700
are not keeping things,
you know,

862
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,810
and so full pitched and I,
she probably already knew.

863
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,160
So it was like,
I'm sorry,

864
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,180
can you help me up off the floor?
And I had to,

865
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:53,310
how humiliating says I'd asked this girl
to like shimmer me off the floor away 

866
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,180
from my mother.
Yeah,

867
00:39:55,181 --> 00:39:57,730
she had a good,
luckily a good sense of humor about it,

868
00:39:57,731 --> 00:40:00,330
but it's not like she.
She,

869
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,590
well I shouldn't say she should be 
flattered,

870
00:40:02,591 --> 00:40:04,660
but a grownup.
What sense of humor?

871
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,920
Be flattered.
She invited her halloween party after 

872
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:09,920
that,
which is a good sign,

873
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,700
but that went bad.
I got All dressed up as the universe.

874
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:15,140
Like I started.
Yeah,

875
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:20,170
I had like a whole black outfit and I 
glued like planets to my body with 

876
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:20,170
velcro,
you know,

877
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:24,310
a grown man and then I go to her house 
on time,

878
00:40:24,311 --> 00:40:26,770
which I didn't realize you don't go to 
parties on time.

879
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,770
I just gotten to la and then I went and 
I went to hug her.

880
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:35,770
I knocked over the skeleton on the wall 
and their dog ran up and like bit venus 

881
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:39,700
off my leg and took off and now I'm just
in the room and no one's dressed up.

882
00:40:39,701 --> 00:40:41,730
People are coming and they're like,
have abandoned any.

883
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:46,740
It's like I'm a pirate,
but no one's really dressed up except 

884
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,321
for me.
So it was a pariah and then no one 

885
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:49,330
taught me how to put the at the end,
this guy,

886
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,370
because all our friends were like,
frat guys.

887
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,990
He goes,
can I ask you a question?

888
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,040
And I was like,
yeah,

889
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:54,250
like,
oh,

890
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,150
someone's talking to me.
He goes,

891
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:59,440
you got no.
No was like,

892
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,640
really?
Yeah.

893
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:02,500
It's like,
now I'm in.

894
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,750
This all started with me getting a boner
with this girl.

895
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:08,350
But anyway,
I gotta go jesus christ.

896
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,790
What a dick.
Yeah.

897
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:12,160
It was kind oF a dick.
Was he a dick before that?

898
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:17,370
Yeah,
they were all kind of like a jockey 

899
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,620
jockey and they were drunk and I think I
seem like a target because I had the 

900
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,640
universe on my body seemed like an easy 
target.

901
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,810
Yeah.
But that's,

902
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:28,410
that's a severe weakness.
Unless you were doing something.

903
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,270
I mean they.
Why wouldn't they think that was funny.

904
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,410
Like,
what are you doing man?

905
00:41:32,411 --> 00:41:34,070
What's with the outfit?
And then you start talking

906
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,820
to.
You start laughing.

907
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:36,470
Everybody has a good guy.
We would've had a good time.

908
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,450
Yeah.
You forget.

909
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,330
Yeah.
Yeah.

910
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:43,760
You know,
that's funny though,

911
00:41:43,761 --> 00:41:48,761
the boner thing because there was a girl
that I dated when I was in high school 

912
00:41:48,761 --> 00:41:50,900
and she,
she was into like rubbing her feet on me

913
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,950
and I had a foot thing for a long time 
and that's because of it.

914
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:56,990
What,
where was she rubbing her feet idea.

915
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:05,420
I meant like where you at your house or 
whatever.

916
00:42:05,421 --> 00:42:09,050
She would just rubber feet on my legs 
and put her feet on my girlfriend.

917
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

918
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,260
I used to go to this math class,
10:30

919
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:17,470
ugly teacher,
but her smell boner every time and I 

920
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,330
knew I was like,
oh,

921
00:42:18,331 --> 00:42:23,331
I gotta go get a boner in this class.
That's hilarious.

922
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:28,600
But that is a real thing about like 
getting connected to like an a 

923
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,540
particular thing,
like whether it's choking someone or any

924
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:33,380
of that guy,
that girl,

925
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:34,280
the girl wanted me to rape her.

926
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:39,280
Also would grab my hand and put it on 
the back or get me to force her head 

927
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:42,260
down.
She was crazy.

928
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,710
She was just really into it.
Yeah,

929
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:49,810
but it took a while for her to warm up.
It's almost like when we first started 

930
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:49,810
fooling around,
she was like,

931
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:50,730
come on,
don't tell them this motherfucker what I

932
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:55,520
like normal.
Then one day she wanted to russell.

933
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,770
Okay.
Yeah.

934
00:42:57,771 --> 00:43:00,080
Just like a gateway.
Drugs like what?

935
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:01,130
She's like,
I want to wrestle you.

936
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:02,960
I'll kick your ass.
I was like,

937
00:43:02,961 --> 00:43:04,850
what the fuck are you talking about?
Like what are you doing?

938
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,040
Theater up.
You lost.

939
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,940
I didn't,
I didn't.

940
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I didn't beat her up,
but I was trying to figure out what 

941
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,130
we're doing while we're doing it.
And she turned in sexual.

942
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,780
She got into it.
Yeah,

943
00:43:17,781 --> 00:43:19,490
I think like,
like louis ck.

944
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,930
I like,
I remember his show,

945
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,690
like one of the first episodes he had a 
show wrote,

946
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:28,010
got older girl asked him to jerk off in 
front of her and I was always like,

947
00:43:28,011 --> 00:43:33,011
I bet that actually happened and that 
got linked up and you can't really 

948
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:36,170
decide what links up your sexuality and 
what it is that turns you on.

949
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,050
It just could have.
I have no information,

950
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:42,710
but that's my guess if people are into 
weird shit man,

951
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,020
during the weird shit.
I think the weirdest is.

952
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:48,350
This is this smelling the shoes.
Oh,

953
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:55,210
marla maples,
trump's x put a camera in her bedroom 

954
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:55,730
because she kept in her closet because 
she kept.

955
00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:00,940
She didn't have one shoe and it was some
friend would come in the economy just 

956
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:04,070
like just coming in and stealing,
sniffing ashish christ.

957
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,200
Zakat linked up.
Oh.

958
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:07,970
anyway,
yeah.

959
00:44:07,971 --> 00:44:09,230
There's a lot of that stuff,
right?

960
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:11,660
Like stealing underwear,
stealing shoes.

961
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,680
Men is.
Men get picked on because we're pervs 

962
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:18,680
and.
And that's true.

963
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,720
But if we weren't pervs this species 
wouldn't be.

964
00:44:20,721 --> 00:44:22,940
Or let me tell you why,
because we were down to like 70,000

965
00:44:22,941 --> 00:44:27,230
people if we didn't have this super per 
game to go through the snow,

966
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,320
get some pussy.
I think it's less than 70,000

967
00:44:30,321 --> 00:44:32,280
people.
They were saying that after

968
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,080
one of the super volcanoes it might've 
gotten down to is just a few thousand.

969
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:37,310
No.
Well,

970
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:41,180
there was a definite.
What does it sumatra?

971
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:42,710
Is that where it was?
Indonesia.

972
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:46,220
Some,
some massive super volcano 70,000

973
00:44:46,221 --> 00:44:48,470
years ago.
Killed oFf almost everybody.

974
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,030
Oh,
I didn't know about that.

975
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,860
We got down to extremely low number.
I think they,

976
00:44:54,861 --> 00:44:59,861
they estimate it's somewhere between 
like two and maybe like 10,000

977
00:45:01,441 --> 00:45:01,920
people.

978
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:07,170
Yeah.
You need people who liked to bug a lot 

979
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:07,170
that are real curvy,
curvy.

980
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:07,170
Jump that up.

981
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:07,490
Well,
you know,

982
00:45:07,491 --> 00:45:09,170
bret weinstein,
who is a.

983
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:11,710
Yeah,
he was a professor.

984
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,530
The zoo,
sorry,

985
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:15,540
what's going on with man?
I smoked weed before the show.

986
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:17,760
I'm not gonna lie to you people.
Um,

987
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:22,790
he um,
was explaining with his wife who's also 

988
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:26,120
a biologist that there's two different 
things that men are attracted to.

989
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:29,630
They're attracted to a beautiful woman,
but they're attracted to a hot woman.

990
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,660
like a hot woman doesn't necessarily 
have to be beautiful,

991
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:37,460
but what she does is offer an 
opportunity for like very quick sex.

992
00:45:37,461 --> 00:45:42,461
Like you could just have sex with her.
You don't have to court her like a girl 

993
00:45:42,461 --> 00:45:46,241
with a short skirt and her tits are 
popping out and she's wearing a lot of 

994
00:45:46,241 --> 00:45:49,391
makeup.
That what that signals is that there's 

995
00:45:49,391 --> 00:45:52,850
an opportunity for you to spread your 
genes and you have no responsibility.

996
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,110
You wouldn't have to take care of it.

997
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:56,270
You wouldn't have to.
You wouldn't have to spend a lot of time

998
00:45:56,271 --> 00:46:00,260
with her court her that she was,
she's the type of person that allows you

999
00:46:00,261 --> 00:46:05,261
to just fuck her.
You can move on and spread your genes 

1000
00:46:05,261 --> 00:46:05,261
elsewhere.
That makes sense.

1001
00:46:05,261 --> 00:46:06,680
Yeah.
That there's like an evolutionary reason

1002
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,560
for that being a stimulating thing for 
men,

1003
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:14,990
for men like this idea of like these 
loose women like loose women are very 

1004
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:17,490
attracted,
very attractive to us for that reason.

1005
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,290
It's not just that like,
oh yeah,

1006
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:20,250
fine,
get some.

1007
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,840
Not deal with all these bitches in 
there.

1008
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:27,140
No.
It's literally an evolutionary trait 

1009
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:27,140
that we have adapted to

1010
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:30,260
the disease thing.
Knocks it back a little bit for me.

1011
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:34,230
I'll go like a disease there.
Anecdote,

1012
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,320
anecdote,
an antidote for.

1013
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:42,730
Cause I,
I don't feel like there's any woman who 

1014
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:42,730
could,
no matter how hot like come and,

1015
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:43,040
and,
and,

1016
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:43,940
and,
uh,

1017
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:47,570
take me away or like a forced me to 
like,

1018
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:49,550
what am I trying to say?
So deuce me.

1019
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:50,960
Wow.
Here it is.

1020
00:46:50,961 --> 00:46:53,540
I think a woman could seduce you.
Now if I don't want her to.

1021
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,310
I have an anecdote.
Anecdote.

1022
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:02,540
I have an antidote and it's,
I've been development over years and 

1023
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:02,540
people that can,
uh,

1024
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:07,600
listening can take this if you like.
Let's say you fell for somebody and she 

1025
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,760
liked him,
she dumped you and you're still pining 

1026
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:11,760
over her.
Put her first.

1027
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,361
You'd like think about like the blood 
moving through her body and her and her 

1028
00:47:16,361 --> 00:47:19,270
skeleton and you put her on the toilet.
I think about like she's making bio.

1029
00:47:19,271 --> 00:47:20,540
I know this is gross,
but that's.

1030
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:24,860
You think about her as this animal and 
you think about her on the toilet.

1031
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,670
Whenever she pops up,
you put her on the toilet.

1032
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,980
You're welcome.
That doesn't work with me.

1033
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,510
It will.
I won't care.

1034
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:32,860
No,
no,

1035
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:34,120
no.
If I think she's hot,

1036
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,100
but she's really struggling on the 
toilet.

1037
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,490
I was struggling the toilet so you could
not judgmental.

1038
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,460
I take,
I eat a lot,

1039
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:44,050
man.
I take some horrific shits.

1040
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,750
But think about like the bachelorette or
something.

1041
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:51,760
They're there.
Fantasize a lot of times early on 

1042
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,360
there's this fantasy and,
and uh,

1043
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,190
you know,
you're,

1044
00:47:53,191 --> 00:47:54,400
you're married.
Yes.

1045
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:55,710
So you're,
you have,

1046
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,760
there's intimacy and you get past all 
that.

1047
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:01,810
But that early on fantasy make filling 
in the blanks as a perfect person.

1048
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:04,480
Usually leave that out.
It never bothered me.

1049
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,540
I don't.
I don't give a fuck about periods.

1050
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,320
what about thinking about the skeleton?
Anything?

1051
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,080
Does that kind of go,
oh yeah,

1052
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:16,380
if you just imagine there's a skeleton 
underneath this woman that I'm like 

1053
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,190
pining over.
She's just like,

1054
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:22,900
it doesn't work.
It doesn't work on me.

1055
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:26,500
It works for tell you man.
If I think someone's hot,

1056
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:31,920
they're hot.
I don't care if they just took a 

1057
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:31,920
diarrhea shit.
How about this?

1058
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:31,920
I imagine they have bad breath.
I'll be like,

1059
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,610
ah,
but she has bad breath and I'd tell her,

1060
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,570
oh,
you're aussie.

1061
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,730
I just say,
listen,

1062
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:42,830
I'd say something really nice.
You're super hot and I'm going to tell 

1063
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:43,390
you something.
compliment sandwich.

1064
00:48:43,391 --> 00:48:46,560
You start with a nice thing and then 
then you go up against yourself or go.

1065
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:50,170
Sometimes I get bad breath and because 
I'm a person,

1066
00:48:50,171 --> 00:48:52,390
everybody gets bad breath.
But when I get bad breath,

1067
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,960
I want someone to tell me absolutely do 
not want to be wandering around.

1068
00:48:55,961 --> 00:48:57,430
Grossing everybody out and they're like,
hey,

1069
00:48:57,431 --> 00:48:58,480
hey,
good to talk to you joe.

1070
00:48:58,481 --> 00:49:01,360
As soon as they turn their head,
tell me.

1071
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:02,130
I don't know.
I'll,

1072
00:49:02,131 --> 00:49:07,131
I'll,
I'll take a listerine strip or chew gum 

1073
00:49:07,131 --> 00:49:07,131
or whatever the fuck some people go 
ahead.

1074
00:49:07,131 --> 00:49:09,460
So I would tell her,
but some people have an pr,

1075
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,660
like,
here's an example.

1076
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:14,170
I was with this girl and I could not 
take the breath.

1077
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,780
Couldn't take it that bad.
And then I said,

1078
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,190
hey,
let's brush our teeth.

1079
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:25,090
Was either it was either you gotta go,
I can't do this.

1080
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,100
I've got to figure out how to brush our 
teeth.

1081
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:32,440
So she brushed her teeth,
reluctantly,

1082
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:38,640
reluctantly brush my teeth clearly,
but it didn't fix it at all like it was 

1083
00:49:41,591 --> 00:49:42,980
coming from our gut.
Some people have like,

1084
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:48,720
you know what?
That happens with a lot of girls who 

1085
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:48,810
would believe or yes,
even anorexic or they gerd,

1086
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:50,950
they regurgitate and bodies all fucked 
up.

1087
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,760
Your body's like super confused.
Him as a data girl puked.

1088
00:49:55,390 --> 00:50:00,390
I didn't know it until like,
like deep into the relationship you had 

1089
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:02,710
to is a couple months and then I found 
out she was just saying like if she eats

1090
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:04,150
too much,
she'll force yourself to throw up.

1091
00:50:04,151 --> 00:50:05,080
and I was like,
why?

1092
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,630
It's easy to hide.
That is.

1093
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,270
I mean I knew it existed,
but I didn't know anybody who had it and

1094
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:14,720
that's a disturbing thing.
Like you ate,

1095
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,960
you're hungry,
so you eat and then you're like,

1096
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:17,890
well,
what have I done?

1097
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:23,140
Yeah,
shove things in your mouth and force it 

1098
00:50:23,261 --> 00:50:25,360
to come up again.
God,

1099
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,830
did you guys talk about or that sort of 
end,

1100
00:50:27,831 --> 00:50:28,580
the relationship

1101
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:29,680
new moved away?
No,

1102
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:30,110
no,
no.

1103
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:33,660
She brought it up and I said,
well she did.

1104
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:37,850
This was the fucked up thing was she 
wasn't in any way overweight.

1105
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,350
I,
she was beautiful.

1106
00:50:39,351 --> 00:50:41,110
she had great body.
She just,

1107
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,460
it was just like a weird.
She was an actress,

1108
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:47,600
you know,
and I think that that per the pressure,

1109
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:51,350
that gig is just so crazy.
It's just,

1110
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:54,170
first of all,
you take someone who,

1111
00:50:54,171 --> 00:50:59,171
most of the time,
the reason why we want to become an 

1112
00:50:59,171 --> 00:50:59,480
actor is because they didn't get enough 
attention.

1113
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:04,600
That's a lot of what causes it.
Especially if you have like this weird 

1114
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:08,300
sort of nonspecific desire for fame.
It's not like you.

1115
00:51:08,301 --> 00:51:13,301
You're a really good character actress.
You know you're a faye dunaway or 

1116
00:51:13,301 --> 00:51:14,690
something like that.
You just really good at.

1117
00:51:14,691 --> 00:51:17,750
You love the craft of creating a 
character.

1118
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:19,580
Now there's a lot of them.

1119
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:22,130
They just want to be famous and why?
Why is that?

1120
00:51:22,131 --> 00:51:24,710
It's usually there's something fucked up
from childhood.

1121
00:51:24,711 --> 00:51:26,630
Usually somebody wasn't paying attention
to them.

1122
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,840
Parents split up.
Something went wrong.

1123
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:34,860
Right?
So you take this person that's super 

1124
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:34,860
insecure and as as exorbitant need for 
attention,

1125
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:37,220
and then you put them through this 
audition process.

1126
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:40,130
The audItion process is the craziest 
thing ever.

1127
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:45,140
It devastates people's self esteem 
because you just get rejected all the 

1128
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:45,390
time.
Rejected all the are.

1129
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:46,940
You're not selling a tee shirt that.
No.

1130
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,500
You're selling yourself like,
yeah,

1131
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,090
tonight's date.
This girl,

1132
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:55,840
when I first moved to la and when she 
would go on auditions,

1133
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:01,420
when if she would get rejected,
she would want to fuck like a wild 

1134
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:05,201
animal.
It's like she wanted something to just 

1135
00:52:05,201 --> 00:52:06,140
like.
She wanted to just fucking scream too.

1136
00:52:06,141 --> 00:52:08,460
She wanted.
She was,

1137
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:11,390
it was the stress of it all was so 
crazy.

1138
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:14,420
She wanted validation.
She wants to blow off steam.

1139
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:20,040
It was just the stress of it all.
It's so unhealthy and the people that go

1140
00:52:20,661 --> 00:52:24,920
into that are some of the most the 
least.

1141
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:28,430
It's the least advisable career path for
them.

1142
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,320
Yeah,
exactly.

1143
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:32,990
Yeah.
It attracts the wrong people.

1144
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:37,790
It's just a fucked up situation.
You have these people judging you like,

1145
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:38,690
come on in,
kyle.

1146
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,720
Yeah.
I can't tell it.

1147
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:41,890
Tell us about yourself.
A lot of trouble auditioning.

1148
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:46,930
Tell me what your favorite animal is.
That's who you are.

1149
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:50,870
I told her,
you told tucker he loved It at a level.

1150
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,340
That's great.
Wow.

1151
00:52:52,341 --> 00:52:57,341
Tom cruise.
I want to audition once and this girl 

1152
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:59,720
told me.
She asked me where I was from and I said

1153
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:02,060
I was from New Jersey and uh,
she goes,

1154
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,920
she goes,
I'm from New York.

1155
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:04,820
She goes,
well,

1156
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:08,180
I'm actually from New Jersey,
but I don't tell people that I go,

1157
00:53:08,181 --> 00:53:08,630
why?

1158
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:09,590
she goes,
well,

1159
00:53:09,591 --> 00:53:11,180
it's cooler to say you're from New York.
I go,

1160
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,050
that's ridiculous.
I go,

1161
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,670
that doesn't make any sense at all.
I go,

1162
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,090
why would you lie?
I go,

1163
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:21,050
and then you just told me and she goes,
are you ready to audition?

1164
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,360
I'm like,
okay.

1165
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:25,590
So she's like giving me like the sour 
look.

1166
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:28,660
And I had a scene with the audition I 
told you.

1167
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:34,610
And then I,
she had a sour look on her face and I 

1168
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:37,251
had to sing a line from a bruce 
springsteen song to her in the audition.

1169
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:43,100
It was so humiliating.
You auditioning for the band movie some 

1170
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:48,260
terrible movie.
It was a singing in the movie where 

1171
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,691
there's a guy and a girl and you know,
like telling the girl how much a lover 

1172
00:53:50,691 --> 00:53:51,630
and I'm singing like fucking born to run
or something like that.

1173
00:53:51,631 --> 00:53:56,631
I don't even remember.
I think everyone would love to hear a 

1174
00:53:56,631 --> 00:53:56,631
little bit right now.

1175
00:53:56,660 --> 00:54:01,290
We can dream.
I don't remember.

1176
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,510
I don't even remember what he didn't get
it.

1177
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:03,990
No,
no,

1178
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:04,500
no,
not.

1179
00:54:04,501 --> 00:54:07,230
Not only did I not get it,
but this is very,

1180
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:12,530
very important moment for me.
I left and I real.

1181
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:17,630
That's when I realized I was like this.
This whole process for me at least is 

1182
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:18,990
broken.
Like I'm not good at this.

1183
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:24,340
This is not.
I'm not good at pretending to be 

1184
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:24,340
someone.
Like everybody who goes in there,

1185
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:28,311
they,
they go into these auditions and there 

1186
00:54:28,311 --> 00:54:28,311
was these people who were like air 
quotes,

1187
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,030
working actors.
They do A little,

1188
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:34,470
you know,
I was on just shoot me for saying,

1189
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:36,480
you know,
I had a nice episode on this.

1190
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:41,570
You know those people,
they're like hopping around those 

1191
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:43,881
people.
They developed this real slick way of 

1192
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:46,560
talking and they don't say nice to meet 
you because they might already met you.

1193
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:50,410
So they say good to see you.
Good to see as kyle I to see it.

1194
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,110
Oh,
it's because I keep remembering,

1195
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:53,230
forgetting,
you know,

1196
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:59,360
dunbar's number.
A certain number of people you can keep 

1197
00:54:59,360 --> 00:54:59,360
in your head,
but this,

1198
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,570
this,
this way of doing it.

1199
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,090
I was recognizing it the way they would 
talk.

1200
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:06,030
Everyone was like super left wing,
super progressive.

1201
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:10,140
No one explored ideas.
You just adopted whatever everybody else

1202
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:12,000
was going with and ran with.
Oh yes,

1203
00:55:12,001 --> 00:55:14,250
I agree.
Hillary is so much more qualified.

1204
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,560
He would just.
People would just say shit like that.

1205
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:18,480
It was just.
It was really strange.

1206
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:23,160
They were like real obvious dEmocrat.
They weren't thinking it through.

1207
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:28,280
They had just adopted this mindset and 
they were just sneaking their way 

1208
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,871
through the system.
They were like exploiting little 

1209
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:36,081
personality holes in the system and they
would get become friends with casting 

1210
00:55:36,081 --> 00:55:39,921
agents and one of the casting agents was
a woman I knew this one casting agent 

1211
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:44,360
who was friends with a friend of mine 
and she was kind of gross and just being

1212
00:55:44,521 --> 00:55:49,521
nice,
being kind by saying kinda and she 

1213
00:55:49,521 --> 00:55:51,030
fucked all these actor guys and she 
would want to know who this is.

1214
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,140
I cAn't tell you.
She,

1215
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:53,550
she,
she's a nice lady.

1216
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,410
She just slipped.
She's.

1217
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:56,430
She was basically doing what,
a lot.

1218
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,500
She was doing the casting couch in 
reverse.

1219
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:03,650
Right.
But she was like aggressive sexually 

1220
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:03,840
aggressive with guys.
Yeah.

1221
00:56:03,841 --> 00:56:06,690
And one of my friends,
she's super sexually aggressive with one

1222
00:56:06,691 --> 00:56:09,150
of my friends.
Is it a henrietta weinstein?

1223
00:56:09,151 --> 00:56:13,770
I can't tell you.
oh well she,

1224
00:56:13,771 --> 00:56:15,150
you know,
she was,

1225
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:19,890
she was casting quite a few different 
shows and she knew how to.

1226
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,870
She knew hOw to get these,
these,

1227
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:26,900
these exploit people,
these guys that were saying good to see 

1228
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:27,370
you.
Those guys.

1229
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,590
She would fuck those guys because that 
was,

1230
00:56:29,591 --> 00:56:31,690
that was the way they could play it,
you know,

1231
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:35,280
that's what they get this when her 
seduction,

1232
00:56:35,281 --> 00:56:37,570
when I don't know what it was.
It'S brutal though.

1233
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,210
Auditioning I,
I'm terrible.

1234
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:43,360
I booked one.
I've gotten like sketch shows,

1235
00:56:43,361 --> 00:56:47,620
but I've only booked one show where it 
was like a script.

1236
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:48,910
A guy.
It was a sitcom.

1237
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I booked like a guest starring thing and
I went in and I'm a terrible reader and 

1238
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,351
for the read through they do a read 
through with a network like at a couple 

1239
00:56:58,351 --> 00:56:58,960
days before they shoot and they gave me 
like,

1240
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,460
oh you have eight new lines,
whatever,

1241
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:03,120
and I can.
I read like a third grader.

1242
00:57:03,121 --> 00:57:08,121
I very poor.
So I the big table read through and I 

1243
00:57:08,281 --> 00:57:09,960
stammered through the whole thing.
I have fired.

1244
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:14,120
So the only show I booked really off 
typical audition,

1245
00:57:14,121 --> 00:57:17,320
reading a script.
I was fired from jesus christ.

1246
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:20,240
I mean so many wasted hours memorizing,
paying,

1247
00:57:20,241 --> 00:57:22,070
acting coach and none of it worked out 
for me.

1248
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,910
It was a lie because I get really 
nervous.

1249
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,540
I feel very judged.
I feel very uncomfortable.

1250
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:33,750
I'm a terrible reader so I ended up like
having to memorize it and then most of 

1251
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:38,731
my time is like trying to remember.
It's just basically get too nervous as 

1252
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:43,780
well.
Did you ever try to like see a hypnotist

1253
00:57:43,781 --> 00:57:45,390
or anything like that or.
No,

1254
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,370
but that probably would've been a good 
idea because it wasn't mental.

1255
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:51,640
Yeah,
shut down.

1256
00:57:51,641 --> 00:57:52,470
Like,
you know,

1257
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,660
some people just react,
you can't help how you react,

1258
00:57:55,661 --> 00:57:58,720
but it's like if you can imagine,
if you're afraid of bees for example,

1259
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,580
it's like go in and audition with a 
bunch of bees flying around.

1260
00:58:02,581 --> 00:58:03,780
You did your,
your,

1261
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:08,790
your body is reacting in a fear way.
It's really hard to grab your facilities

1262
00:58:08,791 --> 00:58:12,030
to act or whatever you're doing to 
possible,

1263
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:14,710
you know.
So no,

1264
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:15,670
I get it.
I mean,

1265
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:18,030
especially if you think like this god,
this could be it.

1266
00:58:18,031 --> 00:58:23,031
This is the big moment.
One of the worst ways for you to behave 

1267
00:58:23,031 --> 00:58:25,480
like or,
or to perform rather in something that's

1268
00:58:25,481 --> 00:58:30,481
like really important,
especially with an acting situation 

1269
00:58:30,481 --> 00:58:31,300
where you know,
you're supposed to pretend to be in love

1270
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:35,650
or to pretend to be happy and whatever 
the fuck it is.

1271
00:58:35,651 --> 00:58:40,651
Like you're,
all you're thinking is don't fuck this 

1272
00:58:40,651 --> 00:58:40,651
up,
don't,

1273
00:58:40,651 --> 00:58:42,960
don't fuck this up.
And that's like the overlying mantra to 

1274
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:42,960
all your thoughts

1275
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:42,960
doing it.
Do this.

1276
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,090
Correct is not the great mindset.
Were you going to do a good performance?

1277
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,880
I like,
I'm A,

1278
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:54,980
just fell out of my head whenever I was 
about to say I was going to be 

1279
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:58,970
hilarious.
It was the best part of the show was 

1280
00:58:58,970 --> 00:58:58,970
going to be great.
Yeah,

1281
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:02,360
but this is one of the reasons why so 
many people are so crazy out here.

1282
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:07,750
It's like come here crazy and then the 
system gets some crazier and then you 

1283
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:11,351
also realize that unless you're doing 
something like what you're doing or you 

1284
00:59:11,351 --> 00:59:14,800
just doing your own thing on instagram,
somebody has to pick you to work.

1285
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,190
You have to get picked,
which is just nuts.

1286
00:59:18,191 --> 00:59:23,191
like as comics,
all we have to do is just go to an open 

1287
00:59:23,191 --> 00:59:23,630
mic night practice,
you know?

1288
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,730
Right.
Come up with some jokes,

1289
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,040
do well.
You come back,

1290
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:29,480
do well.
You come back,

1291
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:31,610
you just keep grinding.
Couple of years down the road,

1292
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:33,680
you started to get a gig here and a gig 
there.

1293
00:59:33,681 --> 00:59:35,870
Yeah.
I'm opening up for this guy and yeah,

1294
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:39,140
I got a gig mc and at this place and 
then a couple of years after that,

1295
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:40,970
a middle and a couple of like,
there's a,

1296
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,550
there's an actual thing you can do if 
you're good,

1297
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,290
you can do,
you can make a living.

1298
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,480
I can't imagine just being an actor.
Forget it.

1299
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:49,880
They go crazy,
dude.

1300
00:59:49,881 --> 00:59:52,430
I,
I have friends that are just actors.

1301
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:55,880
They go crazy.
They all go crazy by the time they're in

1302
00:59:55,881 --> 01:00:00,881
their forties,
they're out of their fucking mind and 

1303
01:00:00,881 --> 01:00:00,881
women.
Oh the,

1304
01:00:00,881 --> 01:00:04,430
that they feel like they're,
they feel like they have this little 

1305
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:05,910
tiny ass hourglass and it's just running
us and everyday.

1306
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:08,570
Yeah.
And like you said,

1307
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:12,200
it's a lot of times you're not starting 
with the most secure people.

1308
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:13,820
No,
almost never.

1309
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:19,130
I never,
I got on stage because I was in so much 

1310
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:20,870
pain.
Like I literally like was pushed.

1311
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:23,240
I was in college.
I had like no friends.

1312
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:25,340
I really painting a pretty picture 
myself today.

1313
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:26,540
But I,
uh,

1314
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,620
yeah,
I wanted like,

1315
01:00:27,621 --> 01:00:30,800
attention,
like that really was the first impulse.

1316
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:34,460
And um,
yeah,

1317
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:39,230
but sometimes that leads to the funniest
shit in the funniest people like this,

1318
01:00:39,231 --> 01:00:42,890
that pressure one way that throws you in
another direction.

1319
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,300
I mean not that,
that bad feeling when you just trying to

1320
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:49,490
escape that bad feeling,
the energy and the desire to escape that

1321
01:00:49,491 --> 01:00:52,640
bad feeling is so intense that it 
creates a good feeling.

1322
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,850
And after a while though it flips to 
like,

1323
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,600
now I,
you know,

1324
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,320
I'm like,
sometimes I don't want to be looked at,

1325
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:06,440
you know,
I think if I got into a bad spot I'd 

1326
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,501
want to go on stage again.
But sometimes do you ever feel like 

1327
01:01:08,501 --> 01:01:09,080
that?
Like you just don't feel like being,

1328
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:13,580
like look at me.
Like I'm like,

1329
01:01:13,581 --> 01:01:18,581
that's not what happens with you 
sometimes I don't feel like going on 

1330
01:01:18,581 --> 01:01:18,581
stage.
No,

1331
01:01:18,581 --> 01:01:18,581
definitely.
No,

1332
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,050
I,
I,

1333
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:24,140
uh,
one of the things that I've been doing 

1334
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:25,751
lately is for a long time I never,
I hardly took any time off.

1335
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,070
But uh,
after I did my special,

1336
01:01:28,071 --> 01:01:32,120
I Just filmed a special in april,
I took a month off.

1337
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:34,770
I didn't do any stand up for a month.
Yeah.

1338
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:36,610
At least like three weeks,
right?

1339
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,140
Like three maybe.
It might've been Four weeks,

1340
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,540
but I was like,
I'm not doing shit.

1341
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:46,190
I went to Hawaii.
I fucking hung out.

1342
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:51,250
I did podcasts.
I didn't do any stand up and it felt 

1343
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:55,391
great.
It felt great that I would leave here 

1344
01:01:55,391 --> 01:01:55,391
and I'd be done.
I wouldn't,

1345
01:01:55,391 --> 01:01:56,960
I wouldn't have another gig to go to at 
night.

1346
01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:02,170
Yeah,
I know there wasn't this overwhelming 

1347
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:02,170
thing looming in the background.
Yeah.

1348
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,820
But after awhile I realized,
all right,

1349
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:05,750
gotta,
get back on the horse.

1350
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:07,340
Yeah,
I've been enjoying it more now.

1351
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:08,970
Go ahead.
What's that worries.

1352
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:10,340
I,
you say interrupted you.

1353
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:13,520
You were going to join more now.
He said,

1354
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:18,010
well I uh,
I'm enjoying stand up now like I,

1355
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:20,010
because I feel like this instagram gave 
me

1356
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:25,010
a little confidence of bring that into 
my standup because I,

1357
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:26,130
uh,
I,

1358
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:31,140
I just kinda was,
I think scared trend to what people 

1359
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:31,140
said.
And,

1360
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:31,580
and there was this thing where like,
you got to make it a sitcom.

1361
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:33,630
You got to be.
Talk about your family.

1362
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:36,570
I had managers who were like,
don't do the guitar,

1363
01:02:36,571 --> 01:02:40,340
don't do this.
Do talk about your family and get.

1364
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:45,390
They were trying to get you to make 
something that could be turned into a 

1365
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:45,570
sitcom so they could take it away from 
you.

1366
01:02:45,571 --> 01:02:47,640
Once your ex girlfriend says you were 
shitty boyfriend.

1367
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:49,170
Yeah,
yeah,

1368
01:02:49,171 --> 01:02:50,770
exactly.
Yeah.

1369
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,890
it's a new thing.
That's what they're doing now.

1370
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,930
That's the new thing.
The new thing.

1371
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:56,200
Yeah.
Uh,

1372
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:57,300
yeah,
there was a lot of that.

1373
01:02:57,330 --> 01:03:02,330
There was a lot of.
They were trying to get people to 

1374
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:03,150
basically put together an audition for a
sitcom.

1375
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:08,150
You're,
your act is essentially like tim allen 

1376
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:08,150
or roseanne or whoever.
What brett butler,

1377
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:09,540
you,
they put you,

1378
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:14,630
you know,
and some people have the confidence and 

1379
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:16,551
not to listen to.
I remember zach alpha eczema was one of 

1380
01:03:16,551 --> 01:03:16,551
the guys who like didn't want to be on a
sitcom,

1381
01:03:16,551 --> 01:03:16,590
and I was.
I was like,

1382
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,810
I didn't believe him because I'm like,
that's what we all have.

1383
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,160
That's what we're all doing.
Right.

1384
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:25,520
But he had like a sense of himself.
I got like out into the world without 

1385
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:30,261
really having confidence in myself.
Like to make a decision to do something.

1386
01:03:30,631 --> 01:03:34,220
I really felt like I needed someone to 
tell me that he does his experiment.

1387
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:39,340
I'm explain this and explain myself real
quick where they did this in the 

1388
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:39,340
seventies.
I'd rattle,

1389
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:42,150
rattle in front of a baby and the mom 
would do this and baby would like it.

1390
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:47,150
Then that you haven't keep rattling it 
and the baby would start to push it 

1391
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:47,150
away.
They haven't keep rallying the.

1392
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:49,590
They will start crying.
All babies go through this exact thing.

1393
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:52,440
Then after the crying,
they have them keep rattling it,

1394
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:57,030
which is something they would never do.
Now at the last phase of the baby's numb

1395
01:03:57,031 --> 01:03:59,120
out and start drooling.
Jesus,

1396
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:01,020
and that's how I lead came into the 
world,

1397
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,010
but I feel like I'm waking up now a 
little bit.

1398
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:07,950
That's fucking dark that they did that 
to a baby.

1399
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,560
Only the seven is what they do.
That.

1400
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:13,770
How many people did they fuck up in the 
seventies?

1401
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:16,860
I know the brown eyed,
blue eyed experiment.

1402
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:21,890
Remember that this they told a classroom
of kids blue.

1403
01:04:22,411 --> 01:04:26,400
White people are smarter and better.
Brown eyed people are to kids.

1404
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:29,130
So then the blue eyed people started,
you know,

1405
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:30,930
doing better work,
behaving better.

1406
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:35,930
The brown eyed kids started misbehaving,
then they switched it to like we were 

1407
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:36,330
wrong.
The broWn eyed kids are the ones who are

1408
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:39,000
smarter and better and the whole thing 
switched.

1409
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:41,940
So they do it as a psychological 
experiment just to see.

1410
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:44,040
Likes to fuck with kid.
Really fuck them up.

1411
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:46,410
Well yeah,
if you tell kids that they're shit,

1412
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,090
they feel like their shit.
Yeah.

1413
01:04:48,091 --> 01:04:49,470
You don't really need to do that 
experiment.

1414
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:50,520
Yeah.
Don't do that.

1415
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:55,620
Go do the opposite of that.
I know that we're talking now about like

1416
01:04:55,621 --> 01:04:58,980
the effects on kids with the trump thing
and the border.

1417
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,920
It's so dark.
It's so.

1418
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:06,930
See what.
What the fuck was melania wearing that 

1419
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:07,790
jacket?
Care.

1420
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:09,960
Do you,
do you think care?

1421
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:11,940
What does it say?
I don't care.

1422
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:15,510
Do you think I do or some shit I don't 
care to use.

1423
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:17,730
I wouldn't.
Is what is

1424
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:24,060
going on in that house?
I think she's losing her marbles 

1425
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:27,940
decision.
Do you think she had any idea when she 

1426
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:30,781
married that billionaire dude and 2005,
she thought she was just getting hooked 

1427
01:05:30,781 --> 01:05:31,150
up.
She's like,

1428
01:05:31,151 --> 01:05:32,050
look,
I'm going to have a kid,

1429
01:05:32,051 --> 01:05:33,310
but this guy,
it's going to be great.

1430
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:38,311
I don't have to work anymore.
All these fucking nude modeling gigs 

1431
01:05:38,311 --> 01:05:39,610
that I was doing and you know,
learn how speak a little bit of english,

1432
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:41,020
whatever,
you know,

1433
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,780
go shopping all the time.
Fuck yeah,

1434
01:05:42,781 --> 01:05:45,700
I'm mad on big good boy,
bad boy,

1435
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:46,930
boom,
I'm in.

1436
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:51,010
And then 10 years later she's the 
fucking vice pro.

1437
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,550
I mean,
she's the president basically.

1438
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:59,120
Well,
she's more popular than the vice 

1439
01:05:59,120 --> 01:05:59,120
president.
Oh yeah.

1440
01:05:59,120 --> 01:05:59,710
Fuck knows who penances don't know god 
damn thing about that guy.

1441
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:04,770
He scares me a little about what might 
be the president one day because the 

1442
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:06,100
lead jesus stuff going on lot of jesus.

1443
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:09,390
Lot more than ever.
Pence sessions,

1444
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:14,490
huckabee lot of jesus,
chris pratt being praised because he 

1445
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:16,180
said people should pray,
which is a legitimate thing to say.

1446
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:19,660
I mean like just whatever prayer is,
mindfulness,

1447
01:06:19,661 --> 01:06:21,280
meditation,
feeling good,

1448
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:23,080
you know,
just being thankful.

1449
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:28,220
You know,
you don't have to attach it necessarily 

1450
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:30,451
to any I ideology or religion.
It's still a good idea to think that 

1451
01:06:30,451 --> 01:06:30,760
way,
but people are going,

1452
01:06:30,761 --> 01:06:35,761
yes,
we got a christian doctor from fucking 

1453
01:06:35,761 --> 01:06:39,931
guardians of the galaxy is one of us and
like the idea that no atheist can be 

1454
01:06:42,701 --> 01:06:46,840
president.
No atheists and no single guys.

1455
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:49,540
Yeah,
better have a family bitch.

1456
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:50,730
Otherwise,
what are you going to do it?

1457
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,750
You're gonna fuck everybody in launch 
bombs.

1458
01:06:52,751 --> 01:06:53,620
Just to see What happens.

1459
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:59,710
That's exactly how it happened.
That is what would happen.

1460
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:01,030
I mean,
could you.

1461
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:06,060
Do you think that it's possible to have 
a single guy or gal as the president?

1462
01:07:06,611 --> 01:07:09,250
I do not.
I do not think it's possible.

1463
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:12,430
It's got a stigma.
People would get weirded out by you.

1464
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:14,260
How old are you?
You're 49.

1465
01:07:14,261 --> 01:07:16,960
You don't even have any kids.
You fucking weirdo.

1466
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,880
You don't have a wife.
Even a sing.

1467
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:23,360
Even at guy who's married with no kids.
I think people will be like,

1468
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:28,400
man,
he's not like us because you could be 

1469
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,730
married with kids and I could be single 
and I don't feel weirded by you.

1470
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:32,500
I don't feel like this is fucking 
weirdo,

1471
01:07:32,501 --> 01:07:35,380
what's he doing on married with kids 
because that's a normal path,

1472
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:40,660
but it's not a normal path to be like a 
55 year old guy with no wife.

1473
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:41,650
No kids.

1474
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:43,450
Never been married.
Yeah.

1475
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:46,610
No desire to.
Because like when you're,

1476
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:49,510
it seems like you're more stable if the 
whole family for sure.

1477
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:51,670
But you have something,
you have some skin in the game,

1478
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:53,590
you know,
you care about your kids.

1479
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:58,620
That's true too.
You don't want to like blow up the 

1480
01:07:58,620 --> 01:07:58,620
world.
So like that sting song.

1481
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:00,580
If the russians love their children too,
you know,

1482
01:08:00,590 --> 01:08:01,180
it's,
you.

1483
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:03,620
We hear a bit of that.
Joe,

1484
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,120
I'll sing it for this audition,
but then I'll walk out of here.

1485
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:12,840
I auditioned for snoopy on broadway.
Humiliating a good boys,

1486
01:08:14,111 --> 01:08:15,850
but they wanted a comedian or something.
So I guess I'm,

1487
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:16,040
I got

1488
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,070
this audition.
The song was like sub sub,

1489
01:08:18,071 --> 01:08:19,790
sub per time sub,
sub separate.

1490
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:23,930
Literally I waited my friend john and 
John Bush,

1491
01:08:23,931 --> 01:08:25,220
comedian.
Uh,

1492
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:25,830
no,
not really.

1493
01:08:25,831 --> 01:08:27,710
A funny guy.
He went in before me and I walked in.

1494
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:32,110
I know his name felt like a bomb went 
off and I walked out in the hoffman,

1495
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:32,900
well what happened?
He was lIke,

1496
01:08:32,901 --> 01:08:37,901
nah,
and I went in there and they were just 

1497
01:08:37,901 --> 01:08:37,901
dead silent and I did like a whole 
dance,

1498
01:08:37,901 --> 01:08:41,741
accepts up supper time to people just 
staring at me and I left and I was like,

1499
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,280
what?
What happened in there?

1500
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:46,430
He goes out of the guide,
said that my audition was cute and I was

1501
01:08:46,431 --> 01:08:47,900
going to leave,
but then I walked back in,

1502
01:08:47,901 --> 01:08:49,040
I tapped on his table.
I said,

1503
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,630
you know what?
You're an asshole.

1504
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:55,650
And then he left and then I was like,
hi,

1505
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:56,840
you're an asshole.

1506
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,760
Because you said it was cute.
Yeah.

1507
01:08:58,761 --> 01:09:03,761
He's like,
why is everybody sort of defensive 

1508
01:09:03,761 --> 01:09:03,761
though?
Yeah.

1509
01:09:03,761 --> 01:09:03,761
Be snoopy,
bro.

1510
01:09:03,761 --> 01:09:04,610
Yeah.
Snoopy's not mad.

1511
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,940
Is this bush character?
Is he always like that?

1512
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,380
He's.
He's hilarious.

1513
01:09:09,381 --> 01:09:10,740
Yeah,
like he Just doesn't like.

1514
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:13,380
he doesn't give a fuck.
He lives in ioWa and Iowa.

1515
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:14,540
Yeah.
What's he doing there?

1516
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:19,930
He's got a nice little.
I've got family in the house as a 

1517
01:09:19,930 --> 01:09:19,930
corporate stuff mostly now.
Oh,

1518
01:09:19,930 --> 01:09:20,970
it was corporate gigs.
Yeah.

1519
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,880
That's weird.
That's a weird world.

1520
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,550
That world of corporate gigs were the 
guys,

1521
01:09:25,551 --> 01:09:28,040
they.
They give up mainstream,

1522
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:30,650
but they can do those corporate gigs 
that pay really well,

1523
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:33,850
but nobody knows about them.
[inaudible] nobody knows they're alive.

1524
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:34,700
Yeah.
They just.

1525
01:09:34,701 --> 01:09:36,320
They just do these corporate gigs.
Yeah,

1526
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:39,260
and you can make some money doing that,
but they're like,

1527
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:41,420
a lot of times,
like during the afternoon,

1528
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:47,240
people are eating food and then you stay
it some best western somewhere.

1529
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:48,640
Oh,
Kansas city.

1530
01:09:48,641 --> 01:09:51,230
Just staring at the wall.
What they do to comedians to go look,

1531
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:56,290
get a comedian when the environment.
I'm sure you've had two gigs like that 

1532
01:09:56,290 --> 01:10:00,941
where you just at a place like,
why did they think that's good for a 

1533
01:10:00,941 --> 01:10:01,400
comedian to come here?
Terrible.

1534
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:03,470
You've done colleges,
right?

1535
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:04,810
Oh yeah.
The kids are on it.

1536
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:09,890
like these 17 year old kid.
I went to one and they had a poster of 

1537
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:10,490
men,
but they didn't put the date or the time

1538
01:10:10,491 --> 01:10:10,820
on it.

1539
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:16,130
Guess how many people showed up?
Million.

1540
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:18,140
A million people.
That's amazing.

1541
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:19,910
That's great.
HoW'd you do?

1542
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,260
I did.
Fantastic.

1543
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:26,430
I asked him one time I was at amhurst.
Oh no,

1544
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:31,510
it was a giant field.
There was one guy in a red hooded 

1545
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:32,960
sweatshirt and the center of the field 
sitting indian style and I said,

1546
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,270
I don't have,
we don't have to do this.

1547
01:10:35,271 --> 01:10:37,370
Right.
And she goes,

1548
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,090
no,
just go out there.

1549
01:10:38,091 --> 01:10:41,330
People hear you will start coming out.
Oh my god.

1550
01:10:41,331 --> 01:10:43,190
One guy,
one guy.

1551
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:46,310
Amorous is a tricky place.
That's uh,

1552
01:10:46,311 --> 01:10:49,490
that's the people's republic of amherst.
So it's like if you took boulder and you

1553
01:10:49,491 --> 01:10:52,330
moved it to western Massachusetts,
amherst,

1554
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,200
super,
super,

1555
01:10:54,201 --> 01:10:58,520
super progressive and liberal.
I did not know that.

1556
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:01,730
Well,
they don't like comedy launch for sure.

1557
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,310
We'll be right back.
That's too bad.

1558
01:11:04,311 --> 01:11:07,840
Most people don't know that impression 
and nobody knows about just uh,

1559
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:12,910
not anymore.
It's Johnny Carson and back in the day 

1560
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:13,010
that age,
you know what I think of,

1561
01:11:13,130 --> 01:11:14,990
I think of johnny carson's a fucked up 
thing to think of,

1562
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:20,490
but he died smoking like some ungodly 
amount of pall mall.

1563
01:11:20,491 --> 01:11:22,920
So you just kept pumping on these pall 
malls.

1564
01:11:22,921 --> 01:11:27,300
Just smoked him constantly and his gut 
had become distended,

1565
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:28,740
like you was pregnant

1566
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,010
and it was just,
he was as rotten with cancer.

1567
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:36,360
Like his whole body was just fucked up 
and apparently like when he died,

1568
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:38,730
like as he was,
as he was dying,

1569
01:11:38,731 --> 01:11:41,430
he's like last days he's like,
these goddamn cigarettes.

1570
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:43,740
Oh god,
I didn't hear the cigarettes.

1571
01:11:43,741 --> 01:11:45,540
It's all I think of when I think of 
Johnny Carson.

1572
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:50,310
I think of him poisoning himself with 
these things that he can't keep from his

1573
01:11:50,311 --> 01:11:51,570
face.
He just can't.

1574
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:57,080
He's got to keep doing it and his body's
is rotting and he goes from being like 

1575
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:00,000
america's favorite all time talk,
show host.

1576
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:03,660
He was the fucking man.
I mean he was the man.

1577
01:12:04,010 --> 01:12:06,340
Yeah.
He goes from that to just quitting,

1578
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:08,190
just stomping

1579
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:11,150
to stopping doing it and then it becomes
this weird thing.

1580
01:12:11,151 --> 01:12:15,250
He becomes this weird guy.
This reckless what?

1581
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,490
What is,
what happens there?

1582
01:12:16,491 --> 01:12:21,491
How does,
how does one go from being the tonight 

1583
01:12:21,491 --> 01:12:22,590
show host to just being a recluse?
Yeah.

1584
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:24,880
He never tried to do anything else,
right?

1585
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:27,430
No.
I like what letterman's doing.

1586
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:30,250
He's doing those things on netflix now.
I haven't seen them.

1587
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:31,960
I haven't either,
but I liked that he's doing them.

1588
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:35,020
I'm worried about him.
I worried he would be one of those guys,

1589
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:37,090
you know,
because he kind of vanished.

1590
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:42,210
Yeah.
Cruise crazy beard and I'm going to do 

1591
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:42,210
that crazy beard.
Yeah.

1592
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:44,440
Yeah.
Okay man.

1593
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:45,580
That's cool.
With you guys.

1594
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:50,810
Do you think these guys,
they just like get to the point where 

1595
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:50,810
they're like,
I can't do this anymore.

1596
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:51,780
There's just too much people.
Too much pressure,

1597
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:56,781
too much.
A lot of pressure every day to do a 

1598
01:12:56,781 --> 01:12:57,480
show.
It takes a certain personality,

1599
01:12:57,490 --> 01:12:58,860
different kind of thing.
Right.

1600
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,150
Exhausting.
I'm sure.

1601
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:05,210
And You're doing standup that's never 
been tried and now it can't be great.

1602
01:13:05,221 --> 01:13:05,760
I mean,
terrible.

1603
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:08,310
It takes a long time to get an act 
together.

1604
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:13,670
That's really good.
So did you hear what happened today in 

1605
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:16,841
the news that day that was good about 
cars though he would make kind of fun 

1606
01:13:16,841 --> 01:13:16,900
about how bad he was.
He.

1607
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:17,900
Yes.
Yes.

1608
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:21,460
Well jay leno was the best at it,
I really feel.

1609
01:13:21,461 --> 01:13:23,290
And that's why they extended his 
monologue.

1610
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:26,290
So even though he wasn't good,
he was a workhorse.

1611
01:13:26,291 --> 01:13:29,110
So every sunday you go to the formosa 
beach club?

1612
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:30,180
Yeah,
I did.

1613
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:35,190
I was on that show and I film something 
and he brought me into the office and 

1614
01:13:35,731 --> 01:13:38,020
uh,
he didn't want to air it and he goes,

1615
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:41,210
I just,
I didn't want to get any letters because

1616
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:46,250
like,
I did that craig character and he just 

1617
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:46,250
felt it was too,
like,

1618
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:47,500
um,
retarded or something.

1619
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:52,210
Yeah.
He played say yeah.

1620
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:53,870
He played it safe when people swung on 
him,

1621
01:13:53,871 --> 01:13:55,520
he'd never swung back.
yeah,

1622
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:56,630
he does.

1623
01:13:57,430 --> 01:13:58,930
Just roll with the punches.
Yeah.

1624
01:13:59,110 --> 01:14:00,750
Would you do a talk show?
No,

1625
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:05,790
I'm doing one right now with one on 
instagram.

1626
01:14:07,271 --> 01:14:10,960
kyle,
the worst name on instagram.

1627
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,010
Why would I do that?

1628
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:17,680
It's,
it doesn't seem like a good way to talk 

1629
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,000
to people.
It doesn't seem like it's fun.

1630
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:22,570
It seems like it's too much pressure.
It seems like there's too many people.

1631
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:27,490
It seems like the conversations become 
fake because you have five minutes until

1632
01:14:27,491 --> 01:14:32,491
you cut to commercial and they come over
with cars and the executive wants to 

1633
01:14:32,491 --> 01:14:33,910
talk to you and the producers want to 
get in your ear and.

1634
01:14:33,911 --> 01:14:34,980
Well,
can we just feel like,

1635
01:14:34,981 --> 01:14:36,460
um,
it just needs a little levity,

1636
01:14:36,730 --> 01:14:37,610
a little it.
so we're,

1637
01:14:37,611 --> 01:14:39,760
we're going to bring it in.
We're going to bring the gesture out.

1638
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:40,540
Oh,
the child.

1639
01:14:40,541 --> 01:14:42,970
But I'm tired of the gesture.
I don't like the gesture and the gesture

1640
01:14:42,971 --> 01:14:47,971
comes out with his little.
Everybody was fucking crowd size clap 

1641
01:14:47,971 --> 01:14:49,990
and the audience they get.
That sign is cheer.

1642
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:51,070
Applause,
applause.

1643
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:53,140
I've,
I've seen too many of them.

1644
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:56,230
I just think it's a dead medium.
I don't like it.

1645
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,270
I,
I'm not recommending it.

1646
01:14:58,271 --> 01:15:00,260
I mean you have it.
People should see.

1647
01:15:00,261 --> 01:15:04,660
Or you should have sTudio tours.
Joe's got the pool table here.

1648
01:15:04,661 --> 01:15:09,661
You have to put your vr on.
We've got the vr goggles now with htc 

1649
01:15:09,661 --> 01:15:09,700
vive.
I don't know what that is.

1650
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:11,710
Vr goggles.
Virtual reality.

1651
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,620
I could have figured that out and put on
these goggles and you box.

1652
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:16,550
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1653
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:21,570
Big dude in front of you throwing 
punches and when it hits you though the 

1654
01:15:21,570 --> 01:15:21,570
screen goes white,
like really get popped.

1655
01:15:21,570 --> 01:15:22,260
Yeah,
it's great.

1656
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:23,920
It's fun.
There's a bunch of.

1657
01:15:23,921 --> 01:15:24,670
Um,
there's um,

1658
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:30,270
there's arChery games.
There's a one with a light saber with 

1659
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:30,270
things come at.
You ain't got to slice them.

1660
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:32,290
They're flying through the air and when 
you're chopping them up,

1661
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,240
that's cool.
You want it to music?

1662
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:40,310
UH,
it's fucking amazing and deprivation 

1663
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:40,310
tank you got here.
I do,

1664
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:40,310
I do.
I have that to joe.

1665
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:41,860
You want to tell them how we did on pool
today?

1666
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:43,360
We did really good.
It was fun game.

1667
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:46,210
How many balls did I get into games that
we played?

1668
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:50,290
Even made one ball.
I did get a call that you made one.

1669
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,730
Got it.
And that's not bad.

1670
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:55,840
went where you wanted it to.
You aimed,

1671
01:15:55,841 --> 01:15:56,950
you shot,
you fired.

1672
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:59,560
It went in.
That was really emasculating.

1673
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:01,810
Those two games.
It shouldn't be two things.

1674
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:06,840
One the tAble.
I didn't tell you because I didn't want 

1675
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:06,840
to freak you out.
Good.

1676
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:06,840
No.
Very tiny pockets.

1677
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:09,100
The pockets are much smaller than a 
normal table.

1678
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:11,860
That table has five and a half inch 
pockets.

1679
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:15,460
That table is four inch pockets.
They're actually slightly under four.

1680
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,020
Yeah,
so they're really small,

1681
01:16:17,021 --> 01:16:17,990
so it's hard to get a ball.

1682
01:16:18,270 --> 01:16:20,680
Okay.
And I play on it everyday.

1683
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:23,390
It wasn't hard for you to get the ball 
and just want to say that.

1684
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:26,590
I told you I planted every day.
I really do.

1685
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,990
I every day after,
after we're done,

1686
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:30,550
I.
That's how I unwind.

1687
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,100
We do the podcasts,
it's over and I go knox and balls around

1688
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:34,760
that.
Your best game pool?

1689
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:35,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

1690
01:16:35,261 --> 01:16:37,980
I'm not good at any games.
That's the only game I'm good at it.

1691
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:42,310
I'm terrible at video games.
I can play quake pretty good at quick.

1692
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,500
Okay.
An archery or good at good at archery,

1693
01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:47,200
but that's not a game.
Not game to me.

1694
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,180
SerIous bro.
Yeah.

1695
01:16:49,181 --> 01:16:52,600
archery is a very different thAn all of 
them because archery is like.

1696
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:55,120
It's very much like a meditation,
you know?

1697
01:16:55,350 --> 01:17:00,350
It requires so much concentration and so
many things have to be in line that as 

1698
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:01,210
you're thinking of all those different 
things,

1699
01:17:01,211 --> 01:17:02,890
it cleans your mind in some weird way.

1700
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:08,400
Very meditative.
You ever read zen and the art of 

1701
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:08,400
archery?
No.

1702
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,100
Really good book.
Interesting book.

1703
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:14,800
It's funny because my friend John Dudley
read it and recommended it to me and 

1704
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,000
he's like,
and he's a world class archer.

1705
01:17:17,001 --> 01:17:22,001
Like he,
he just got back from europe where they 

1706
01:17:22,001 --> 01:17:22,130
flew him out to coach various,
uh,

1707
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:24,130
international teams.
LIke he's a,

1708
01:17:24,131 --> 01:17:28,190
like a real world class coach and archer
himself.

1709
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,510
And he said,
he's like,

1710
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:31,610
it's interesting you like,
this book is really good,

1711
01:17:31,611 --> 01:17:36,611
but I have a feeling that the guy who 
wrote it wasn't really that good at 

1712
01:17:36,611 --> 01:17:36,611
archery.
Oh.

1713
01:17:36,611 --> 01:17:36,860
I'm like,
oh,

1714
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:38,840
that's fascinating.
It's like the guy he goes,

1715
01:17:38,841 --> 01:17:41,000
I feel like he was kind of there but not
quite.

1716
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:42,830
And I'm like,
that's interesting.

1717
01:17:42,831 --> 01:17:46,910
Coming from a guy who's a real master,
like recognizes some something,

1718
01:17:46,911 --> 01:17:51,911
some errors in his thinking or the way 
describes things or his approach really 

1719
01:17:52,491 --> 01:17:52,970
interesting.

1720
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,010
By the way,
you never have to ask me again.

1721
01:17:55,011 --> 01:17:57,890
Did you read that book?
I did not read any books.

1722
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,800
I haven't read a book in a long time.
Thank god.

1723
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:02,350
Someone's honest.
I mean,

1724
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:03,830
you could say,
did you hear this book?

1725
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:05,420
Sometimes they'll get an audio book,
download it.

1726
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:06,710
Oh,
I love audio books.

1727
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:11,890
I read one audio or read one book for 
every seven or eight audio books I 

1728
01:18:13,761 --> 01:18:17,870
listened to or read one maybe and I 
don't even read most.

1729
01:18:17,871 --> 01:18:22,871
I don't even read.
Sometimes I'll start off reading it and 

1730
01:18:22,871 --> 01:18:23,090
then I'll go,
this is too much work.

1731
01:18:23,091 --> 01:18:24,410
I'm just going to listen to it in my 
car.

1732
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,450
I just listened to it.
I don't.

1733
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:31,550
It's like there's a lot of dead time.
There's a lot of time that's not being 

1734
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:34,970
used and that time is when I'm driving 
and I'm always driving here.

1735
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:38,450
I'm driving to the gym or I'm driving 
into the comedy store.

1736
01:18:38,451 --> 01:18:42,140
I'm driving to the airport.
I fill that up with books on tape.

1737
01:18:42,170 --> 01:18:44,210
do you do self help books?
No.

1738
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:47,180
No.
Mostly like right now I'm reading,

1739
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:52,010
I'm reading the tipping point,
which is a malcolm gladwell book and I'm

1740
01:18:52,011 --> 01:18:55,520
also reading sapiens,
which is who wrote sapiens.

1741
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,570
I heArd someone read the book.
The tipping point is great.

1742
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:01,610
It's really great.
Really interesting.

1743
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:05,600
And also felt like,
who is it?

1744
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,110
Yuval noah harari.
Oh,

1745
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:09,980
okay.
That's great too.

1746
01:19:09,981 --> 01:19:10,760
And also,
uh,

1747
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:12,290
the talent code.
There's another book.

1748
01:19:12,291 --> 01:19:14,510
I'm in the middle of the tubings.
Great book.

1749
01:19:14,511 --> 01:19:16,660
This book sapiens.
fucking fantastic.

1750
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:18,950
Opiates,
a brief history of humankind.

1751
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:21,350
Very enlightening.
Oh yeah.

1752
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:26,710
That tipping point.
I feel it could have been three 

1753
01:19:26,710 --> 01:19:26,710
sentences long.
Yeah,

1754
01:19:26,710 --> 01:19:27,050
it was.
It was a little,

1755
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:28,640
you know,
there is.

1756
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:30,050
I get it after awhile.

1757
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:33,350
Like I got it.
I got a bunch of things collide together

1758
01:19:33,351 --> 01:19:35,230
and anything can happen.
And the next thing,

1759
01:19:35,231 --> 01:19:39,950
no hush puppies are really popular.
My tipping point was joe rogan played my

1760
01:19:39,951 --> 01:19:41,930
instagram videos.
Not crazy.

1761
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:44,420
Yeah.
That's the only tipping point that makes

1762
01:19:44,421 --> 01:19:46,160
me very happy.
I love doing that.

1763
01:19:46,161 --> 01:19:47,780
I am.
I will always.

1764
01:19:47,781 --> 01:19:50,080
I will if you need.
This is just between me and you.

1765
01:19:50,081 --> 01:19:52,370
If you need me to murder someone or you 
need some favor.

1766
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,410
Good dude.
Good.

1767
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:58,140
But I'm going to contact you in behalf 
of Donald Trump to deal with it.

1768
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:04,480
You really are worried about the time I 
was going to kill time on the floor.

1769
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,000
It might be.
I don't know what,

1770
01:20:07,070 --> 01:20:09,280
what It is.
Consumer now take it back.

1771
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:11,970
When people do kill themselves,
you gotta go,

1772
01:20:11,971 --> 01:20:16,971
okay,
how many times did this person think 

1773
01:20:16,971 --> 01:20:16,971
about this?
Like,

1774
01:20:16,971 --> 01:20:21,560
how,
how many times did they get close and 

1775
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:21,560
they didn't want.

1776
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:22,690
I don't have that in me,
you know,

1777
01:20:22,691 --> 01:20:23,780
I don't know why,
whatever,

1778
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:28,860
whatever it is.
Maybe it's because I take care of 

1779
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:28,860
myself.
Maybe it's genetic,

1780
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,380
maybe it's because I live a happy life.
Basically locked pro.

1781
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:32,540
I don't either.
But yeah,

1782
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,700
I had,
I think luck is a big thing.

1783
01:20:34,701 --> 01:20:36,100
It's a big factor.
Um,

1784
01:20:36,101 --> 01:20:41,101
I have a friend who killed himself and 
his brother had killed himself before 

1785
01:20:41,101 --> 01:20:43,400
that and everybody loved him and it was 
just stunning to everybody.

1786
01:20:43,401 --> 01:20:44,790
everybody's like,
what the fuck?

1787
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:46,950
I'm,
I didn't know him that well,

1788
01:20:46,951 --> 01:20:50,100
but I knew him well enough to really,
like them was really,

1789
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:52,680
really good guy.
And people get down.

1790
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:56,240
You have to be in so much pain to do 
that.

1791
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:58,660
I don't know what it is.
It's a.

1792
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:00,600
So you know,
a guy like tom arnold,

1793
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:02,220
who knows,
he might be like,

1794
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:06,230
he might've tasted the barrel a couple 
of times and been like,

1795
01:21:06,231 --> 01:21:07,440
you know what?
I'm just going to fuck it.

1796
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:11,820
Shot,
he's a got a lot of energy.

1797
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:13,950
Does he?
Tom?

1798
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,240
From what I've seen.
Yeah.

1799
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:18,390
What have you seen?
I played this game with him.

1800
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:23,870
It was like a big house game,
but your people and it was a just run 

1801
01:21:23,870 --> 01:21:25,530
around and tag things.
I never quite figured it out.

1802
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:30,640
He was sweating like a pig and running 
around behind it.

1803
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:34,210
Yeah.
I liked that show idea that I'm like,

1804
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:37,080
check it out his show.
It's not out yet,

1805
01:21:37,081 --> 01:21:38,040
right?
I don't think so.

1806
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:40,530
I think his vice.
What is,

1807
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:45,560
what's going on with vice?
Somebody tell me that vice is going 

1808
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:45,560
away.
It's not going away.

1809
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:46,350
They uh,
the changes are happening.

1810
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:51,530
so they hired a new ceo or vp or 
something that's sort of all the 

1811
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:51,930
program.
I'd probabLy be changed for the fall.

1812
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:54,480
it's weird that it's a whole channel.

1813
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:58,050
It's like It's a whole channel.
Vice has a channel.

1814
01:21:58,350 --> 01:22:01,260
I couldn't find it saved my life.
Yeah,

1815
01:22:01,261 --> 01:22:04,740
there's too many god damn channels.
Channels.

1816
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:10,010
You know what's hilarious?
I watch a lot of hunting shows and the 

1817
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:13,871
outdoors shows,
they're all like a lot of like really 

1818
01:22:13,871 --> 01:22:17,240
christiany people.
Like a lot of these hunting,

1819
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:20,390
outdoors type to like to know christ,
just like,

1820
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:25,440
uh,
just want to thank you lord for this 

1821
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:25,440
opportunity to take down this.
Like there's a lot of that.

1822
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:30,220
But what's funny is that on direct tv 
they're only like two or three channels 

1823
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:34,811
removed from hardcore porn.
So it's like you go through the lineup 

1824
01:22:34,811 --> 01:22:38,810
you go into to get into the five 
hundreds and it's hardcore porn,

1825
01:22:38,811 --> 01:22:43,811
hardcore porn like daddies and step 
daughters and big cocks and holes.

1826
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:49,010
And then right after that,
it's like the great outdoors,

1827
01:22:49,430 --> 01:22:54,430
you know,
and jesus and little landmines blessed 

1828
01:22:54,430 --> 01:22:55,820
with mike,
the hunter.

1829
01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:00,880
I'm blessed mount here,
blessed this great world and this great 

1830
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:00,880
country.
Blessed

1831
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:01,890
hill.
You w and they have like the.

1832
01:23:01,950 --> 01:23:03,220
Yeah,
they have the uh,

1833
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:04,860
scientology channel now

1834
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:08,320
channel.
I think it's up there.

1835
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:09,280
Nice.
$500.

1836
01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:10,690
Nice.
Nice.

1837
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:13,360
I did radio once.
I'll never forget this.

1838
01:23:13,361 --> 01:23:17,320
I did this radio show in denver and uh,
it just morning radio before gig,

1839
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:18,370
like you know,
you,

1840
01:23:18,371 --> 01:23:23,371
do you promote the gay k joe rogan's 
going to be at the comedy works in 

1841
01:23:23,371 --> 01:23:23,680
denver here this weekend.
And then in the middle of the thing they

1842
01:23:23,681 --> 01:23:25,570
go,
it's time for our pledge of allegiance,

1843
01:23:25,571 --> 01:23:29,380
ladies and gentlemen.
And so I'm sitting there going,

1844
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:31,360
what is happening?
So this is two.

1845
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:33,940
They put their fucking hand on their 
heart and they go,

1846
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:39,030
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the 
United States of America and to the 

1847
01:23:39,030 --> 01:23:42,301
republic for which is.
And they get into it like full 

1848
01:23:42,301 --> 01:23:44,140
earnestness and we're,
we're looking at each other,

1849
01:23:44,141 --> 01:23:49,141
me and uh,
I think ari or duncan was with me and 

1850
01:23:49,141 --> 01:23:51,670
we're like,
what in the fuck did you play along?

1851
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:57,570
Well I would if it was like a game or 
something like that and you know,

1852
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:59,470
stand for the flag.
Okay,

1853
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:01,510
I'll do that.
I'm not going to make anybody feel bad.

1854
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,570
That's not what it was.
It was a radio show.

1855
01:24:04,690 --> 01:24:07,300
You're in the middle of the radio show 
and you do a pledge of allegiance.

1856
01:24:07,301 --> 01:24:10,390
So what the fuck is this?
Did you stay just stay still or.

1857
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:11,860
I don't remember what I did.
No,

1858
01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:14,710
I remember.
I remember being high as fuck.

1859
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:19,060
So it made it extra weird because 
whenever I would do those radio shows,

1860
01:24:19,061 --> 01:24:21,490
we would just meet downstairs because 
you know,

1861
01:24:21,491 --> 01:24:23,320
you got to be at them at 6:00
in the morning,

1862
01:24:23,321 --> 01:24:28,321
you're exhausted and you know,
you don't necessarily really want to do 

1863
01:24:28,321 --> 01:24:32,431
it,
but we would meet downstairs and get 

1864
01:24:32,431 --> 01:24:35,800
becu and so then it was an adventure.
It was like everything was free that the

1865
01:24:35,801 --> 01:24:36,850
wind was scaring me.

1866
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:37,500
I was like,
oh,

1867
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:39,400
where's the car that's taking us to get 
in the car?

1868
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:41,740
And then we talked to the people and it 
was always like,

1869
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:42,910
all right to the driver,
like,

1870
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:47,911
okay,
who's the biggest dickhead you've ever 

1871
01:24:47,911 --> 01:24:50,011
had to drive?
Because there's always like one story 

1872
01:24:50,011 --> 01:24:51,910
comedians that hated being there and it 
was always.

1873
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,530
I would hear you would hear a bunch of 
them,

1874
01:24:53,531 --> 01:24:55,760
but like disgruntled,
angry people.

1875
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:57,430
One of them was always richard.
Jenny.

1876
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,350
There was always at richard.
Shannon was always properly.

1877
01:24:59,430 --> 01:25:04,430
Yeah,
richard genuine because he never wanted 

1878
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:04,430
to be that guy.
He never wanted to be the road.

1879
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:07,600
He wanted to be that guy who put 
together the act that got them the jerry

1880
01:25:07,601 --> 01:25:09,080
seinfeld sitcom.
Right,

1881
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:14,280
and meanwhile he was one of the greatest
standup comedians of all time.

1882
01:25:15,130 --> 01:25:20,130
You saw him a bunch of times when I was 
coming up and a bunch of times in clubs 

1883
01:25:20,201 --> 01:25:25,201
and he was a fucking killer,
like one of the most unheralded and 

1884
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:28,090
unappreciated,
underappreciated standups of all time.

1885
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:29,830
He's the only one of my all time 
favorites,

1886
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:31,720
but.
But it was bumming me out.

1887
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,490
I would hear that.
He was miserable.

1888
01:25:33,491 --> 01:25:35,710
He didn't want to talk to anybody.
It was all bummed out.

1889
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:37,680
I was like,
here is like the.

1890
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:42,820
His death is crawford was making 
pancakes and he blew his face off.

1891
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:44,780
He was still alive.
He like,

1892
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:46,510
did it.
It went wrong.

1893
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:50,290
Oh jesus christ.
To bring the room down.

1894
01:25:50,350 --> 01:25:53,110
She's so he went under the chin.
Yeah.

1895
01:25:53,111 --> 01:25:55,480
I guess it's slit.
That happens more often.

1896
01:25:56,180 --> 01:26:00,900
You just take the face.
Fuck taking the face.

1897
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:03,940
Jesus christ be back.

1898
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,440
That's another one.
Another guy killed himself.

1899
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:09,230
Crazy.
That,

1900
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:12,260
you know,
it's so common.

1901
01:26:12,890 --> 01:26:15,110
It's so common.
It's hard to be a person.

1902
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:18,140
We're the first species that knows we're
going to die.

1903
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:21,440
Very aware of our like impending death.
That right there.

1904
01:26:21,441 --> 01:26:24,080
You need to medicate that species.
If you looked at a chart,

1905
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:27,170
the evolution of monkeys,
you go,

1906
01:26:27,171 --> 01:26:29,660
okay,
this first level of primate,

1907
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:31,180
we gotta help them out.
Right.

1908
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:33,440
They're dealing with so they're going to
get very religious,

1909
01:26:33,441 --> 01:26:36,290
which is good,
but some of them we got to medicate this

1910
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:36,920
group.
Yeah.

1911
01:26:36,921 --> 01:26:38,720
They can handle it on their own.
Well,

1912
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:41,800
we used to die young,
so it was like you wouldn't have to deal

1913
01:26:41,801 --> 01:26:46,801
on yourself because you only live to be 
30 and now we have so much more time on 

1914
01:26:46,801 --> 01:26:50,021
her hands.
Want have to work all day to get a meal 

1915
01:26:50,021 --> 01:26:50,021
and then collapse.

1916
01:26:50,021 --> 01:26:51,200
We're sitting around and I could think 
about this.

1917
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:55,520
Fuck.
You see yourself getting older every day

1918
01:26:57,030 --> 01:26:58,490
to happening.
It's happening.

1919
01:26:58,550 --> 01:27:00,440
I love it.
You love aging.

1920
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:02,750
I love it.
What's your favorite part of the pain or

1921
01:27:02,751 --> 01:27:04,070
the.
I liked the pains.

1922
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:08,450
I like tired.
That's tough to get some bursitis.

1923
01:27:08,451 --> 01:27:10,340
That's pretty sweet.
Nice.

1924
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:12,770
I do like though,
I do feel more comfortable.

1925
01:27:12,771 --> 01:27:17,020
I'm feeling less anxious in some ways 
more another.

1926
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:19,040
Oh,
I guess I'm pretty.

1927
01:27:19,041 --> 01:27:20,410
Even though,
well,

1928
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:25,420
you're more aware of things,
but then you're also going to be more 

1929
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:28,391
aware of your impending demise.
We don't live long enough like we need 

1930
01:27:28,391 --> 01:27:32,451
to live 500 years.
I've thought about the first hundred 

1931
01:27:32,451 --> 01:27:34,400
years to fix like your childhood stuff 
that she imagined though.

1932
01:27:34,401 --> 01:27:38,210
If you did leave live 500 years,
would you be dating like 100 year old?

1933
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:42,170
It'd be like these fucking 100 year olds
don't know shit.

1934
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:46,730
She said she doesn't know shit.
Hadn't been around.

1935
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:50,180
Do you imagine if you were 500 years old
and you were dating a 30 year old people

1936
01:27:50,181 --> 01:27:52,010
will be like,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

1937
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:54,200
You couldn't do it,
but why not?

1938
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:56,990
She's a grown ass woman.
She's 30 years old.

1939
01:27:56,991 --> 01:27:58,790
That's a grown ass woman,
right?

1940
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,830
Like a 30 year old could data 50 year 
old,

1941
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:03,290
60 year old and you're like,
you'd better be rich.

1942
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:06,410
A 70 year old.
Like something that'd be going on.

1943
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:10,280
Yeah.
I don't feel like we mature after 25 men

1944
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:16,070
myself then.
I don't know,

1945
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:21,250
but don't you think though that there is
a certain requirement of a lack of 

1946
01:28:21,321 --> 01:28:26,321
maturity to be funny to be like,
like some of the shit that you did in 

1947
01:28:26,321 --> 01:28:27,950
those videos?
A grownup would not,

1948
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:29,840
you would not do,
you know,

1949
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:30,580
like,
oh,

1950
01:28:30,650 --> 01:28:33,450
you hit that retarded kid,
but you have caitlyn.

1951
01:28:34,030 --> 01:28:39,030
Caitlyn like driving with a clean record
now because bruce killed that fucking 

1952
01:28:39,030 --> 01:28:40,550
lady.
I mean,

1953
01:28:40,670 --> 01:28:45,670
which is I wonder if that's the case.
I don't know what's happening with that 

1954
01:28:45,670 --> 01:28:46,460
case,
but the video doesn't look great.

1955
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:47,980
Um,
I'm,

1956
01:28:47,981 --> 01:28:49,910
it's an accident obviously,
but uh,

1957
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:50,960
no,
it's horrible.

1958
01:28:51,170 --> 01:28:53,870
That family must be like to have that 
happen to them.

1959
01:28:53,871 --> 01:28:58,510
They lose their loved one and then to 
see her just like completely around just

1960
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:01,630
hero of the year and all that rich man,
ma'am

1961
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:07,640
smudger now baby,
there's a show called lost in 

1962
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:11,751
transition,
which I recommend highlights people 

1963
01:29:11,751 --> 01:29:13,440
transitioning and it's a lot of old 
people in their fifties and stuff.

1964
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:15,780
Wow.
That's what's weird about it.

1965
01:29:15,781 --> 01:29:20,781
It's like there's a lot of it is people 
that have kind of given up on sex don't 

1966
01:29:20,781 --> 01:29:21,250
even want to have sex anymore.
Yeah.

1967
01:29:22,030 --> 01:29:23,560
Which is one of the things that caitlin 
said.

1968
01:29:24,350 --> 01:29:25,820
Sex is kind of like,
it doesn't matter.

1969
01:29:25,821 --> 01:29:26,220
Right?
Right.

1970
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:30,060
But then why I snippety snip,
I don't know,

1971
01:29:30,061 --> 01:29:34,080
but the.
They say that they become like teenagers

1972
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:39,140
when they do transition.
There was like a period where they're 

1973
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:40,620
feeling this teenage feel that coming 
into their own finally,

1974
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:42,930
but they're older men.
You know,

1975
01:29:42,931 --> 01:29:47,931
when it had this period in caitlin,
they kind of got caught it on that show 

1976
01:29:47,931 --> 01:29:51,081
a little bit.
It's like you're kind of like a new 

1977
01:29:51,081 --> 01:29:53,010
person,
I guess you feel like that it's timed.

1978
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:58,040
I feel like this is.
You remember when we read about George 

1979
01:29:58,040 --> 01:29:58,040
Washington having wooden teeth?
Yeah.

1980
01:29:58,040 --> 01:29:58,890
I read about that.
Is that not true?

1981
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,200
Yeah.
I'm sure he did the best they had,

1982
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:06,740
but I think you hear about that.
If you heard about a guy today that it 

1983
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:06,740
wouldn't.
The book,

1984
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:07,140
what the fuck get that kind of a 
dentist.

1985
01:30:07,170 --> 01:30:09,030
The fuck is he?
Do they have implants and give them real

1986
01:30:09,031 --> 01:30:11,450
teeth is crazy.
I feel like

1987
01:30:11,690 --> 01:30:14,960
there is going to be a time,
maybe not in our lifetimes,

1988
01:30:14,961 --> 01:30:19,961
but maybe shortly after where you know 
they use crispr or some gene editing 

1989
01:30:21,381 --> 01:30:26,381
materials,
something like that where they can 

1990
01:30:26,381 --> 01:30:26,381
actually turn you into a.

1991
01:30:26,381 --> 01:30:28,850
Oh well,
I mean once you go through puberty.

1992
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:29,720
No,
no,

1993
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,070
no,
no.

1994
01:30:30,330 --> 01:30:33,810
Can alter your jeans.
Look what what they can do now.

1995
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:38,840
What mostly what they're doing now is 
they're doing work with embryos and 

1996
01:30:38,911 --> 01:30:39,630
they're,
they,

1997
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:42,540
they're planning on altering people from
the jump,

1998
01:30:42,541 --> 01:30:46,290
like from the time they're born,
but as that technology gets better,

1999
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:51,820
more effective,
they're going to be able to utilize it 

2000
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:54,201
on regular people and they've actually 
started introducing certain genes into 

2001
01:30:54,201 --> 01:30:58,131
people that didn't have them before in 
order to fix certain ailments or 

2002
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:03,260
alterations in jeans to like to try to 
combat certain life threatening 

2003
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:07,971
diseases.
Like all these things around the table 

2004
01:31:07,971 --> 01:31:09,951
and I think it's just a matter of time 
before they come up with the technology 

2005
01:31:09,951 --> 01:31:10,950
that allows someone to completely alter 
their,

2006
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:12,120
their actual set.

2007
01:31:12,410 --> 01:31:16,560
Next.
I have things that alter by myself.

2008
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:19,350
What would you check it first?
I'd be hot as fuck.

2009
01:31:19,351 --> 01:31:24,351
Okay.
Would you be hot in like a like nobody 

2010
01:31:24,351 --> 01:31:24,351
likes you way.
Like,

2011
01:31:24,430 --> 01:31:25,190
like,
like,

2012
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:27,210
or like thor,
thor.

2013
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:28,260
He came,
I was on a plane.

2014
01:31:28,261 --> 01:31:33,261
He came in,
he had this big for hair and he like 

2015
01:31:33,261 --> 01:31:33,261
whipped it back.
Whoa.

2016
01:31:33,261 --> 01:31:33,261
And I live in,
we're like,

2017
01:31:33,261 --> 01:31:35,310
huh?
I was with my girlfriend at the time and

2018
01:31:35,311 --> 01:31:38,130
I saw her like look at me and him and 
I'll take it.

2019
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:43,330
yeah,
it's nothing you can do that 

2020
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:43,950
recalibrates like what you see as good 
looking when you see actual.

2021
01:31:43,951 --> 01:31:48,951
Because his wife was there and she used 
this model because we see your face 

2022
01:31:48,951 --> 01:31:48,951
every year.
You're like,

2023
01:31:48,951 --> 01:31:50,850
I'm all right logan.
But when you see actual gorgeous people,

2024
01:31:50,910 --> 01:31:53,250
I was staring at them for like 20 
minutes.

2025
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:54,360
Real creepy.
Like,

2026
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:57,900
and then I went to the bathroom and I 
must've been calibrated.

2027
01:31:57,901 --> 01:32:00,160
I looked like a monster.
As soon as you looked

2028
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:04,300
at yourself I was just like nothing.
Symmetrical lettuce on my hair look like

2029
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:07,690
lettuce.
Anyway,

2030
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:09,700
I,
yeah,

2031
01:32:09,701 --> 01:32:10,420
I,
I would.

2032
01:32:10,421 --> 01:32:15,421
I'm not change any personality.
I wouldn't make myself a better person.

2033
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:20,730
You wouldn't.
I would just make myself gorgeous 

2034
01:32:20,730 --> 01:32:20,730
because that's all it matters to me.
Joe,

2035
01:32:20,730 --> 01:32:23,170
would you care about.
Would you be built like the rock?

2036
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:25,170
I'd be ripped his shit.
Right?

2037
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:26,650
I mean,
I'm pretty huge.

2038
01:32:26,651 --> 01:32:31,651
Right.
What kind of a giant hug would you have 

2039
01:32:31,651 --> 01:32:32,290
on you have to take?
I'd probably like 10 inch hog.

2040
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:37,480
Take four inches off my hog right now.
Will you put what you put on the table 

2041
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:37,540
when you hear it?
Yeah.

2042
01:32:37,541 --> 01:32:40,140
I had a nice,
like a.

2043
01:32:40,170 --> 01:32:43,860
Was that tommy who's okay.
Pushing the boat horn with his conch.

2044
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:45,760
Tommy lee.
Oh yeah.

2045
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,900
I do get a tommy genetically engineered.
Tommy leacock.

2046
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:52,480
Nice.
I actually don't care about that.

2047
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:53,890
I'm.
No,

2048
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:57,790
I'm thinking if I had something mutated,
but right.

2049
01:32:57,910 --> 01:32:58,460
There's a.
There's.

2050
01:32:58,530 --> 01:33:01,270
There seems like a zone.
As long as you're in that zone.

2051
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:04,710
You don't want to be micro penis.
You don't want to be too big that it's.

2052
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:07,060
Yeah.
You don't want to hurt people.

2053
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:12,120
Yeah.
I hate having a 12 inch cock because I 

2054
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:13,030
have to.
I can only get the tip in.

2055
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,710
I get it.
It sucks.

2056
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:17,830
Especially if you're the tip,
it's like a Beer can.

2057
01:33:18,190 --> 01:33:20,200
Yeah,
big old fat boy.

2058
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:23,740
We're oN with those 500 channels right 
now.

2059
01:33:24,510 --> 01:33:27,810
So it starts.
There's a,

2060
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:30,100
there's quite a lot of those channels 
still.

2061
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:35,130
It's like,
don't these people know about the 

2062
01:33:35,130 --> 01:33:35,130
internet?
Like whY are you paying 29,

2063
01:33:35,130 --> 01:33:35,130
99 for this?
Yeah,

2064
01:33:35,130 --> 01:33:36,700
whatever you're paying.
How is that not dead yet?

2065
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:42,380
I,
it's probably kids that parents aren't 

2066
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:42,380
looking and they just rack it uP.

2067
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:46,810
Or guys who just want four k in the big 
screen,

2068
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:48,790
have enough.
Has enough time gone by.

2069
01:33:48,870 --> 01:33:52,900
We've noticed the effect of online porn.
Uh,

2070
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:57,190
well first your with pubic hair.
Oh,

2071
01:33:57,230 --> 01:33:58,450
pubic cared.
Vanished.

2072
01:33:58,630 --> 01:34:03,630
That's true bit my act about it.
It's like the best sign of porns 

2073
01:34:03,630 --> 01:34:06,100
influence in our culture is the absence 
of pubic hair.

2074
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:11,130
Like if you had a time machine and you 
can get scientists from the future and 

2075
01:34:11,130 --> 01:34:12,940
they're studying the time period between
1990 and 2018,

2076
01:34:12,941 --> 01:34:17,941
the most confusing thing would be what 
happened to the pubic hair because 

2077
01:34:17,941 --> 01:34:18,730
there's no historical record.
Nobody discussed it.

2078
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:23,980
Interesting.
They just started hacking off their 

2079
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:25,711
pubes.
How do you feel about the bald 

2080
01:34:25,711 --> 01:34:25,711
situation?
It's normal.

2081
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:27,730
It doesn't.
It doesn't bother me anymore,

2082
01:34:27,731 --> 01:34:30,610
but when I was a kid,
I mean when I was young,

2083
01:34:30,611 --> 01:34:31,960
nobody did anything.
Girls would.

2084
01:34:32,050 --> 01:34:34,240
It was chaos down there.
It was a disaster.

2085
01:34:34,241 --> 01:34:39,241
It was like he would touch their.
Like when you were going down on a girl 

2086
01:34:39,241 --> 01:34:41,470
or you were fooling around,
you put your hand down her pants and you

2087
01:34:41,471 --> 01:34:44,290
feel it outside the underwear.
There was like an afro in there.

2088
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:48,250
Like you had like a covering over,
like the forest buffer.

2089
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:48,760
Yeah.
I was like,

2090
01:34:48,761 --> 01:34:53,761
somebody threw like five haircut.
Somebody threw a parachute over tree 

2091
01:34:54,451 --> 01:34:56,980
tops.
Just touch it.

2092
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,130
Yeah.
I mean I was

2093
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:03,130
an adult when I really like I,
I thought it was just like a barbie 

2094
01:35:03,130 --> 01:35:04,730
doll.
Like I didn't really know that there was

2095
01:35:04,731 --> 01:35:09,731
so much going on until a.
There was a funny moment when I was in 

2096
01:35:09,731 --> 01:35:13,871
high school.
It was a girl that I was dating at the 

2097
01:35:13,871 --> 01:35:15,791
time.
It was actually right after high school 

2098
01:35:15,791 --> 01:35:17,740
and she had this guy that she had.
We had to like fooled around a bunch of 

2099
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:18,980
times,
like fooled around,

2100
01:35:18,981 --> 01:35:21,530
don't fool around for a few months,
fooled around that kind of thing and she

2101
01:35:21,531 --> 01:35:25,370
had some boyfriends that she was dating 
for awhile and this boyfriend apparently

2102
01:35:25,371 --> 01:35:28,190
got her to shave her pussy and she,
well we were fooling around just like,

2103
01:35:28,210 --> 01:35:28,900
I can't,
I can't.

2104
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:29,840
I go,
what's the matter?

2105
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:30,860
She goes,
I can't show you.

2106
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:32,540
I go,
you can't show me what?

2107
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:35,810
And she was like,
he made me shave.

2108
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:37,430
I go,
he made you shave?

2109
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:39,050
She goes,
I don't want you to see.

2110
01:35:39,051 --> 01:35:40,610
It's so embarrassing.
I go,

2111
01:35:40,970 --> 01:35:44,180
I don't give a shit so you don't have 
any hair down there.

2112
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:45,460
I was like,
but it was weird.

2113
01:35:45,461 --> 01:35:47,090
That was the first time I'd ever seen 
him shaped box.

2114
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:48,330
Weird when you're like,
whoa,

2115
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:49,620
look at all this.
It was,

2116
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:52,760
it was like my beard.
It was like this.

2117
01:35:52,761 --> 01:35:56,330
I shaved like three days ago.
So it was like that.

2118
01:35:56,410 --> 01:35:58,490
Yeah.
It was like,

2119
01:35:58,510 --> 01:36:03,510
it was coming back,
but it was coming back and she was 

2120
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:03,510
italian,
so it was just chaos.

2121
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:05,060
It was coming back like,
you know,

2122
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:08,090
it was the whole fucking they'll put 
women really.

2123
01:36:08,091 --> 01:36:13,091
Do I have to wax that?
You have to shave their feet.

2124
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:16,370
They have to shave their legs.
They have to shave everything,

2125
01:36:16,371 --> 01:36:17,870
whatever.
Everything kind of hair on it.

2126
01:36:17,930 --> 01:36:20,570
Me to hasn't hit that area.

2127
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:26,050
Well that's not what it is.
Me too is about sexual harassment and 

2128
01:36:26,050 --> 01:36:27,860
assault.
So to be about grooming choices.

2129
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:31,280
Let me too.
Shit.

2130
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:34,110
I hate shaving my legs.
Me too.

2131
01:36:35,110 --> 01:36:37,280
Me too is.
It's so ridiculous.

2132
01:36:37,281 --> 01:36:39,280
I haven't been reading up on that.
Would it be to.

2133
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:42,440
You just don't read like what does me 
to.

2134
01:36:42,441 --> 01:36:46,090
Anything they're upset at feminism just 
said.

2135
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:49,400
Well they went with the armpits.
They try to keep the armpits.

2136
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,700
Like girls were like keeping the armpits
with it.

2137
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:54,620
You have to be super,
extremely not shaved the legs.

2138
01:36:55,190 --> 01:37:00,190
Yeah.
And to let your ass our just grow wild 

2139
01:37:00,190 --> 01:37:00,220
and just got to be a reckless person.
Yeah.

2140
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:03,110
You have to be careless.
You don't care.

2141
01:37:03,410 --> 01:37:05,120
You're renegade.
You're an outsider.

2142
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:07,970
Yeah.
Crazy jungle asshole hair.

2143
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:13,240
Definitely better to be a man in terms 
of grooming shows 100 percent.

2144
01:37:13,630 --> 01:37:14,390
Yeah.
You just,

2145
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,850
you just don't,
just to be clean.

2146
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:19,100
If your wife said,
I'm not shaving anymore,

2147
01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:21,950
would you have the talk?
Would you say whatever you want?

2148
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:23,270
I would,
um,

2149
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:27,880
I'd have to figure out a way to get her 
to play with wax or something like that.

2150
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:32,890
Just rip it all off though.
Go lasers play a game of laser tag and 

2151
01:37:32,890 --> 01:37:37,890
people if you imagine if they had like,
that's how they get rid of it,

2152
01:37:40,971 --> 01:37:42,530
right?
There's laser hair removal.

2153
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:47,740
But imagine if there was like a gun.
You can just drive down the street and 

2154
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:50,051
shoot people's hair off.
I think that's assault those eyebrows 

2155
01:37:50,051 --> 01:37:52,670
pop.
It seems very dangerous.

2156
01:37:52,730 --> 01:37:55,160
Although it's shooting a laser beam.
That's how you get lasik,

2157
01:37:55,950 --> 01:37:56,190
which

2158
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:58,170
sounds insane to me.
Is that how they do it?

2159
01:37:58,230 --> 01:38:01,890
So some of it is they do with a scalpel 
and actual scalpel.

2160
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:03,280
Oh,
I thought they just burned her ibo,

2161
01:38:03,281 --> 01:38:03,920
the,
some of them.

2162
01:38:03,921 --> 01:38:06,840
But I think some of them they do.
I think there's two different ways to do

2163
01:38:06,841 --> 01:38:11,841
it.
I think sometimes they do it with an 

2164
01:38:11,841 --> 01:38:11,841
actual scalpel,
like a blade.

2165
01:38:11,841 --> 01:38:16,120
And I,
I don't know if they think that that's 

2166
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:18,071
more precise.
I don't know what they worried about 

2167
01:38:18,071 --> 01:38:18,620
lesbians before lasik surgery was don't 
look what a fucking laser beam.

2168
01:38:20,030 --> 01:38:22,310
That was the whole thing.
Well here it goes.

2169
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:24,050
Laser pointer,
burns hole.

2170
01:38:24,051 --> 01:38:26,660
And young boys are.
Oh god damn it

2171
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:29,350
story going around.
It's a nine year old in Greece.

2172
01:38:30,030 --> 01:38:32,370
That's the actual whole burned into his 
eyeball.

2173
01:38:32,430 --> 01:38:35,430
What the fuck?
I'm staring out with those crazy lasers

2174
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,920
might be one of the new ones that are 
coming out that like.

2175
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:43,820
I know that you know,
remember they went crazy in the 

2176
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:43,820
nineties.
Everyone was buying red pointer lasers.

2177
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:48,560
There's a new version of them that are 
really high powered light stuff on fire 

2178
01:38:48,741 --> 01:38:53,741
for pointing it out a wasn't enough.
Like people have like lit bongs on fire 

2179
01:38:53,741 --> 01:38:56,841
with them.
They'll know if it's these crazy one is 

2180
01:38:56,841 --> 01:38:56,841
that this same kid use.
But oh the poor isn't new.

2181
01:38:56,841 --> 01:39:01,491
High level.
Like people were making youtube videos 

2182
01:39:01,491 --> 01:39:01,491
with them.
What the fuck do you do with design?

2183
01:39:01,491 --> 01:39:01,491
No.

2184
01:39:01,491 --> 01:39:03,780
Does he just have a hole in it forever?
It says decreased vision.

2185
01:39:04,420 --> 01:39:06,130
So just as a whole one his vision 
forever.

2186
01:39:06,250 --> 01:39:08,200
Yeah,
I guess he's all right.

2187
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:13,840
Doctors found a large macular hole in 
the retina is left on the child reported

2188
01:39:14,061 --> 01:39:17,870
playing with the green laser pointer,
a pdd gazing into the laser beam there.

2189
01:39:17,871 --> 01:39:19,910
Right?
Because of the large size of the hole.

2190
01:39:20,090 --> 01:39:23,750
The doctors decided on a conservative 
approach rather than surgery.

2191
01:39:23,850 --> 01:39:27,030
Fuck.
And you're fucking your eyeballs up when

2192
01:39:27,031 --> 01:39:32,031
you're a little kid because some asshole
parent wants to just play with their 

2193
01:39:32,031 --> 01:39:34,160
phone and let that kid shoot laser beams
the laser.

2194
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:34,990
Okay.
Wait.

2195
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:37,800
Who's watching the kid?
How do you get the laser?

2196
01:39:37,950 --> 01:39:40,290
Did he have a job?
Did he go to the store and buy?

2197
01:39:40,291 --> 01:39:42,060
What the fuck are you doing with your 
kid?

2198
01:39:42,450 --> 01:39:43,550
You got kids?
Yeah,

2199
01:39:44,070 --> 01:39:47,340
that scares me.
You got to make sure that you know safe.

2200
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:48,300
Yeah,
we do.

2201
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:50,400
Well,
you're 47 if you want to do it.

2202
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:53,250
You've got to do it soon.
I got like 30 years.

2203
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:55,410
Oh,
two figure this out.

2204
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,360
Well,
trump had won when he was 60.

2205
01:39:57,660 --> 01:39:59,370
Okay.
Baron.

2206
01:39:59,371 --> 01:40:00,840
He had one who's like 60,
right?

2207
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:03,330
Yeah.
So got I go back and forth.

2208
01:40:03,630 --> 01:40:06,290
I don't hear good reviews.
They never.

2209
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:08,490
It's never like a clean do it.
It's great.

2210
01:40:08,491 --> 01:40:10,820
It's always champion.
Get ready.

2211
01:40:12,230 --> 01:40:13,220
We're gonna.
Change your life.

2212
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:16,160
You've got to get ready for.
Do you have a steady gallo sleep?

2213
01:40:16,370 --> 01:40:16,820
Uh,
yeah.

2214
01:40:17,090 --> 01:40:18,740
How long?
Year and a half.

2215
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:19,520
Oh,
that's good.

2216
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:20,920
Yeah.
Does she want them?

2217
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:22,530
Yeah.
How old is she?

2218
01:40:23,230 --> 01:40:25,480
20.
She'll be 28 and august.

2219
01:40:25,510 --> 01:40:26,890
Nice.
Yeah.

2220
01:40:27,010 --> 01:40:28,980
I know it's young,
but I move.

2221
01:40:29,890 --> 01:40:32,570
She pursued me.
Just get that atar.

2222
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:37,620
Keep talking.
Should we go out to go down on channel 

2223
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:37,620
five?
Ninety two?

2224
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:43,040
I feel like such sweating.
Well,

2225
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:45,130
she wants to have kids.
She's still young and fertile.

2226
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:46,930
You'd probably shoot a live one in there
and make a person.

2227
01:40:48,530 --> 01:40:51,680
Is that the technical term one?
If you go to a doctor,

2228
01:40:51,681 --> 01:40:52,670
that's how I describe it.
Yeah.

2229
01:40:52,671 --> 01:40:57,570
Yeah.
Cow live round in there.

2230
01:40:57,750 --> 01:41:02,020
Eight like this.
Thanks doc.

2231
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:05,860
I'm to show you.
You keep her legs up in the air.

2232
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:09,240
You want to make sure you get it down 
there.

2233
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:12,730
She rides on your swimmers might not 
making up the canal.

2234
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:17,760
You know what I'm saying?
Is that a true thing you gotta lay him 

2235
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:17,760
back?
I don't know.

2236
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:19,690
It makes sense.
I'd like to have kids.

2237
01:41:19,730 --> 01:41:21,630
I would someday.
Someday I did.

2238
01:41:21,670 --> 01:41:26,670
You don'T have some day when you're 47,
you really don't have some day because 

2239
01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:30,811
one of the things about autism is a lot 
of it is age of the father.

2240
01:41:31,930 --> 01:41:34,900
It's not just the age of the mother is 
the age of the father.

2241
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:37,220
I feel like I've been in a coma,
you know,

2242
01:41:37,221 --> 01:41:39,780
disease where you fall asleep for 20 
years and you wake up.

2243
01:41:39,850 --> 01:41:41,230
That's how I feel.
Why?

2244
01:41:41,590 --> 01:41:43,510
I don't know.
I don't know where those years went.

2245
01:41:43,870 --> 01:41:46,250
I feel like I woke up recently and I'm 
like,

2246
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:48,400
well how am I.
What am I doing now?

2247
01:41:48,401 --> 01:41:53,401
Do you think this is because you weren't
doing what you wanted to do because you 

2248
01:41:53,401 --> 01:41:57,640
were just doing a bunch of other shit 
and the years just kept piling up maybe.

2249
01:41:57,730 --> 01:41:59,530
I mean,
do you feel.

2250
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:02,800
I guess maybe kids you can track your 
life a little easier.

2251
01:42:02,801 --> 01:42:07,801
Maybe it's because I didn't have kids.
It sort of seems like one chunk that 

2252
01:42:07,801 --> 01:42:08,350
went by fast.
The kids,

2253
01:42:08,351 --> 01:42:11,020
you caN mark years with your kids.
Well,

2254
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:15,400
the reality of being a person is if we 
really do live to be 80,

2255
01:42:15,401 --> 01:42:20,401
9,100,
if you're really lucky that if you have 

2256
01:42:20,401 --> 01:42:24,720
$100 it goes quick.
You buy a sandwich by some,

2257
01:42:24,940 --> 01:42:29,940
a drink,
get some chips and you go to the movies 

2258
01:42:29,940 --> 01:42:30,700
and then you don't have enough for 
dinner.

2259
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:33,130
You know,
it's like a dollar here,

2260
01:42:33,131 --> 01:42:36,400
a dollar there.
You're a year is not that long.

2261
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:39,700
It's 365 days it happened so quick and 
next thing you know,

2262
01:42:39,701 --> 01:42:44,701
it's two years and then it's five years 
and then 10 years later and then 30 

2263
01:42:44,701 --> 01:42:46,300
years later and then.
Then.

2264
01:42:46,301 --> 01:42:48,430
Yeah.
Oh you got to get your hip replaced.

2265
01:42:48,431 --> 01:42:49,070
Huh?
Whoa.

2266
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:51,210
What are you going to do?
You're saying I got get my,

2267
01:42:51,270 --> 01:42:52,480
my,
my shit in order.

2268
01:42:52,481 --> 01:42:53,800
That's like,
that's you're telling me right here.

2269
01:42:53,801 --> 01:42:55,410
You're giving me.
I think you've already done.

2270
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:57,640
You're getting your shit in order,
right?

2271
01:42:57,641 --> 01:42:58,570
I mean,
I think,

2272
01:42:58,640 --> 01:43:03,640
um,
I think what you did with starting this 

2273
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:05,641
instagram page,
like deciding that you can't keep this 

2274
01:43:05,641 --> 01:43:05,641
gig anymore.
It was a very brave and smart.

2275
01:43:06,130 --> 01:43:08,140
I realized it.
I appreciate that.

2276
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:13,200
I don't feel like it's brave.
I feel like I was like that fear and not

2277
01:43:13,241 --> 01:43:15,130
be able to sleep and I was forced.

2278
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:16,900
That's how it feels.
Well,

2279
01:43:16,901 --> 01:43:21,280
it's probably whatever the fuck it is,
your body,

2280
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:26,460
the fate of the universe,
whatever it is just telling you like 

2281
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:27,460
you're not,
you can't do this anymore.

2282
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,410
You can't,
you know,

2283
01:43:29,411 --> 01:43:31,690
and you just listened to it.
Some people don't ever listen man.

2284
01:43:31,691 --> 01:43:33,890
They just start medicating themselves.
Yeah.

2285
01:43:33,970 --> 01:43:38,970
And they just drone out.
They take ssri eyes and they just show 

2286
01:43:38,970 --> 01:43:42,361
up and they just,
they just get everything becomes like a 

2287
01:43:42,361 --> 01:43:44,920
dull medium and then just keep doing it 
over and over and over again.

2288
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:49,780
Yeah.
I am glad I feel right now.

2289
01:43:49,781 --> 01:43:52,100
Really thankful

2290
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:57,170
and I'm mean just to have been able to 
do shows.

2291
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:59,930
People coming out.
It's just,

2292
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:05,560
you know,
for years it was like up and down all 

2293
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:08,381
over the place.
Now I feel like I do have some kind of 

2294
01:44:08,381 --> 01:44:09,170
following that I can directly contact.
No,

2295
01:44:09,171 --> 01:44:11,660
you definitely do.
And it's gonna keep growing.

2296
01:44:11,661 --> 01:44:16,661
I mean,
you keep putting out the videos like 

2297
01:44:16,661 --> 01:44:16,661
you're putting out,
you're going to keep growing.

2298
01:44:16,661 --> 01:44:16,661
There's no way around it.
It's,

2299
01:44:16,661 --> 01:44:17,960
it's great.
It's fucking.

2300
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:23,350
Look,
we have so many different avenues now 

2301
01:44:23,350 --> 01:44:25,730
that didn't exist before and one of the 
things that I think is really cool about

2302
01:44:25,731 --> 01:44:28,850
today versus when I started,
uh,

2303
01:44:28,851 --> 01:44:31,700
I started in 88,
is that there's,

2304
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:34,820
there's not like a competitiveness with 
comedians.

2305
01:44:34,821 --> 01:44:36,950
Instead.
There's like a hyper supportiveness.

2306
01:44:37,310 --> 01:44:40,040
Everybody's quick to tell you about 
people who are really good.

2307
01:44:40,370 --> 01:44:45,200
Everybody wants everybody to know this.
LIke there's no famine anymore because I

2308
01:44:45,201 --> 01:44:50,201
think before when there was only one 
tonight show or a letterman and there 

2309
01:44:50,201 --> 01:44:51,530
was a sitcom and everybody was 
scrambling for,

2310
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:53,810
you want to get thursday night at 8:00
on nbc.

2311
01:44:53,810 --> 01:44:58,810
That's where the friends pot is like 
everybody wanted to get in the right 

2312
01:44:58,810 --> 01:44:59,600
spot and you know,
there's not that anymore.

2313
01:44:59,630 --> 01:45:01,910
That's an interesting point.
I hadn't thought of that.

2314
01:45:02,390 --> 01:45:07,390
Yeah.
Now it's like everybody has a youtube 

2315
01:45:07,390 --> 01:45:10,100
channel or a twitter page or an 
instagram thing or a podcast.

2316
01:45:10,101 --> 01:45:15,101
They're all doing their own thing and 
instead of being competitive with other 

2317
01:45:15,441 --> 01:45:16,850
comedians,
everybody's like,

2318
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:18,600
everybody has everybody on there shows 
like,

2319
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:21,530
like all these guys that are top 
podcasters,

2320
01:45:21,740 --> 01:45:23,950
we all do.
Everybody's show.

2321
01:45:23,990 --> 01:45:26,470
Yeah.
I'm always doing either joe,

2322
01:45:26,471 --> 01:45:31,471
he does my show or I'll do his show or 
I'll do tom show or he'll do my show or 

2323
01:45:31,471 --> 01:45:35,591
I'll do dunkin show or he'll do my.
It's like constant back and forth and 

2324
01:45:35,591 --> 01:45:37,880
everybody's supportive because it's,
it doesn't hurt anybody.

2325
01:45:37,881 --> 01:45:41,120
It just helps.
And the more like if I,

2326
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:45,530
if I tell people you gotta check out 
kyle done against instagram page,

2327
01:45:45,531 --> 01:45:47,360
they're going to go and they're gonna 
say he's right.

2328
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:50,000
Larry's.
So it's good for everybody.

2329
01:45:50,001 --> 01:45:55,001
It's good for me because they know that 
I'm not going to bullshit them and it's 

2330
01:45:55,001 --> 01:45:57,770
good for anybody else to.
And it's also good because it's good for

2331
01:45:57,771 --> 01:46:02,771
me because I want you to do really great
because I want more of those funny 

2332
01:46:02,771 --> 01:46:04,130
videos to watch.
It's like it's good for everybody.

2333
01:46:04,190 --> 01:46:06,870
I feel like giving a cash.
Ah,

2334
01:46:07,460 --> 01:46:08,910
luckily just keep,
uh,

2335
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:14,440
keep taking dives and pool that I was 
trying really hard.

2336
01:46:17,470 --> 01:46:20,330
It's a hard game.
It's been a while since I played.

2337
01:46:20,390 --> 01:46:23,000
That's my.
It's one of those games you,

2338
01:46:23,070 --> 01:46:25,820
you're not supposed to take time off of 
that fucking stupid game.

2339
01:46:26,390 --> 01:46:27,940
That's a game that you have to play 
every day.

2340
01:46:28,750 --> 01:46:29,280
We'll,
we'll,

2341
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:31,400
we'll play again.
Play in a year.

2342
01:46:31,430 --> 01:46:33,140
Okay.
Practice practice up.

2343
01:46:33,290 --> 01:46:36,530
Maybe after tHe show you'll play better 
because you'll be thinking,

2344
01:46:36,650 --> 01:46:38,000
but what you did wroNg.
No,

2345
01:46:38,001 --> 01:46:39,990
I definitely,
yeah.

2346
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:45,040
was a rustY there.
Do you have like an ultimate goal which 

2347
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:48,800
you want to do with pool with stand up?
My pool goes your career now.

2348
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:50,250
Now that you've got momentum,

2349
01:46:50,750 --> 01:46:55,750
I would,
I mean I'd love to just build the 

2350
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:55,750
audience,
um,

2351
01:46:55,750 --> 01:47:00,200
and just do a bigger venues so I don't 
have to travel so much.

2352
01:47:01,110 --> 01:47:06,110
I'd like to just have like a life and be
able to do like weekend gigs and then 

2353
01:47:06,391 --> 01:47:07,620
come back.
Yeah.

2354
01:47:07,710 --> 01:47:10,710
And have enough money to be comfortable.
Those thursday,

2355
01:47:10,711 --> 01:47:11,580
wednesday,
thursday,

2356
01:47:11,581 --> 01:47:12,270
friday,
saturday,

2357
01:47:12,271 --> 01:47:17,040
sunday weeks and a lot of people do.
People don't realize you're alone for 23

2358
01:47:17,041 --> 01:47:22,041
hours.
Then you have too much attention for an 

2359
01:47:22,041 --> 01:47:22,041
hour,
then you're alone for 23 hours.

2360
01:47:22,041 --> 01:47:22,910
Go to it,
just,

2361
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:24,750
yeah,
if you're not using the right,

2362
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:27,900
I'm like mindset to go out and do stuff 
and go to the gym.

2363
01:47:27,901 --> 01:47:31,710
If you're like a hurt you hermit,
you're in real trouble mentally in a lot

2364
01:47:31,711 --> 01:47:34,110
of people do.
I think that's what richard jenny did.

2365
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:36,090
Yeah.
Um,

2366
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:39,120
a lot of people do wind up hermiting 
yeah.

2367
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:44,120
I always make sure that I exercise and 
always make sure I do something.

2368
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:45,780
Go out,
do something.

2369
01:47:45,781 --> 01:47:47,340
It makes a giant difference.
Yeah.

2370
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:50,610
You just feel way better.
I feel like a person route.

2371
01:47:50,611 --> 01:47:53,520
I need a routine without having a boss 
or like a job.

2372
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:55,780
I need a routine to stay.
When you go on the road,

2373
01:47:55,781 --> 01:48:00,781
do you bring somebody with you?
Like an opening act can't really afford 

2374
01:48:00,781 --> 01:48:00,781
at this point.
That's another thing.

2375
01:48:00,781 --> 01:48:00,890
like,
uh,

2376
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:04,350
let me get a bigger audience.
You can bring friends right now.

2377
01:48:04,351 --> 01:48:05,210
I just,
uh,

2378
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:09,150
I jogged there.
I ride my bike there by myself.

2379
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:11,550
Do you have a basket where you put all 
your stuff?

2380
01:48:12,260 --> 01:48:13,840
Front bag.
Little thing ling,

2381
01:48:14,130 --> 01:48:19,130
I um,
I started bringing people on the road a 

2382
01:48:19,130 --> 01:48:21,081
long time ago because I had a couple of 
gigs that I did and the local guys were 

2383
01:48:21,871 --> 01:48:25,230
so terrible and it was,
it made it so much more excruciating.

2384
01:48:25,230 --> 01:48:25,830
Oh,
absolutely.

2385
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:31,760
Because you've got to sit through this 
thing about watching someone who just 

2386
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:33,600
has no idea what the fuck they're doing.
Udl And after it's over,

2387
01:48:33,601 --> 01:48:34,980
you're convinced.
Nothing's funny.

2388
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:36,300
There's nothing funny.
Yeah.

2389
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:39,510
You hate stand up as a genre.
Like he can't be funny.

2390
01:48:39,511 --> 01:48:41,130
Nothing can be funny.
This isn't funny.

2391
01:48:41,131 --> 01:48:43,800
Nothing is funny.
It's not funny.

2392
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:47,070
I had a great middle guy luckily in the 
last thing they did.

2393
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:47,910
Oh,
that's great.

2394
01:48:47,990 --> 01:48:49,050
Yeah.
where were you?

2395
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:51,540
Um,
the american comedy.

2396
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:52,470
Oh,
san diego?

2397
01:48:53,070 --> 01:48:53,750
Yes.
Great.

2398
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:56,380
Great.
What's funny audience?

2399
01:48:56,381 --> 01:49:00,450
So fun.
little area to write the drunks.

2400
01:49:00,451 --> 01:49:01,210
Awesome.
Yeah.

2401
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:02,910
Yeah.
if you look for gals,

2402
01:49:03,180 --> 01:49:04,720
perhaps a little liquored up,
that's your,

2403
01:49:04,790 --> 01:49:07,950
that's free is a good place for you.
I love san diego period.

2404
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:13,380
Lived down There.
That gets voted the number one city to 

2405
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:15,801
live in.
It's a fucking great place because it's 

2406
01:49:15,801 --> 01:49:16,050
like a city,
but it's not too big and it has a little

2407
01:49:16,051 --> 01:49:17,580
bit of traffic,
but it's not crazy.

2408
01:49:17,610 --> 01:49:20,580
Perfect weather if you want to.
Yeah,

2409
01:49:20,581 --> 01:49:22,740
and it has everything.
It's got restaurants.

2410
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:25,350
People are cool.
Also the militaries there.

2411
01:49:25,530 --> 01:49:28,530
It's never going to get attacked.
Well maybe it is.

2412
01:49:28,930 --> 01:49:30,860
I mean pearl harbor.
That's right.

2413
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:32,190
It's great.
Cocaine.

2414
01:49:32,191 --> 01:49:34,040
You get greek cocaine.
Sure.

2415
01:49:37,610 --> 01:49:38,400
Oh,
fIll.

2416
01:49:38,401 --> 01:49:41,010
That guy's an asshole.
I gotta try.

2417
01:49:41,070 --> 01:49:44,730
I gotta try psychedelics because I've 
never done them.

2418
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:46,860
But you smoke pot,
smoke pot.

2419
01:49:46,930 --> 01:49:49,870
I eat it at night.
Helps me sleep.

2420
01:49:50,470 --> 01:49:54,670
Do you ever tried those sprays like 
jumbo breast sprays,

2421
01:49:55,180 --> 01:50:00,180
numb marijuana sprays.
Wish I knew I brought so I would have 

2422
01:50:00,180 --> 01:50:00,250
brought some for you.
So way to go.

2423
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:05,880
You try.
Are you going to get free sprays now 

2424
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:05,880
because you mentioned it not by him.
Do you ever do that?

2425
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:06,250
I would do that.
Like,

2426
01:50:06,310 --> 01:50:08,080
boy I love,
you know,

2427
01:50:08,110 --> 01:50:13,110
reebok's sneakers and then it's easier 
to just buy them.

2428
01:50:13,660 --> 01:50:17,920
People send you stuff too much stuff.
I don't want.

2429
01:50:18,430 --> 01:50:21,210
It's like the,
you know,

2430
01:50:21,211 --> 01:50:22,630
you,
you probably want them just to send that

2431
01:50:22,631 --> 01:50:24,800
to like a homeless person or something.
Well,

2432
01:50:24,820 --> 01:50:26,820
I just don't want them to send it to me.
Yeah,

2433
01:50:26,930 --> 01:50:31,930
you know,
we can work out a thing where you give 

2434
01:50:31,930 --> 01:50:35,011
it to me and then don't worry about it.
And then you just have like fucking 

2435
01:50:35,011 --> 01:50:38,850
kanye west 100 like monster drink cases 
he's holding.

2436
01:50:40,511 --> 01:50:43,300
It just ain't conspicuously as he talks.
Oh,

2437
01:50:43,330 --> 01:50:46,930
that's what I could do.
monetize product placement.

2438
01:50:48,090 --> 01:50:51,040
I'm going to monetize.
I'd like to like keep it.

2439
01:50:51,070 --> 01:50:56,070
I mean they were joking,
but like have caitlin just drinking 

2440
01:50:56,070 --> 01:50:59,010
monster drinks are fantastic.
They give me energy ever since I shot my

2441
01:50:59,261 --> 01:51:02,760
natural,
what I went and chop off age.

2442
01:51:04,870 --> 01:51:06,850
I wonder if that does happen.
It happened to my dog.

2443
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:09,130
I got them fix and he became very 
listless.

2444
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:09,630
Ooh.
Ooh.

2445
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:11,170
Oh really?
He was like,

2446
01:51:11,171 --> 01:51:12,660
what's the point?
Oh no,

2447
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:13,840
what's the point,
man?

2448
01:51:14,060 --> 01:51:19,060
Hold your dog while he was at the time.
He was five when I got his,

2449
01:51:19,061 --> 01:51:24,061
uh,
his gun.

2450
01:51:25,541 --> 01:51:27,820
Lowell schnipper snippy.
I got a tiny dog,

2451
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:31,120
which isn't a great look for a man,
but what kind of dog love it?

2452
01:51:31,180 --> 01:51:32,740
Uh,
it's a pug chihuahua mix.

2453
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:36,280
But the way I talked to my dog an excuse
it,

2454
01:51:36,290 --> 01:51:40,660
it's offensive to me as a man.
Like I tell myself,

2455
01:51:41,590 --> 01:51:46,590
I get my permission,
like window was looking at her paws and 

2456
01:51:46,590 --> 01:51:46,590
this just came out of me.
I went,

2457
01:51:46,590 --> 01:51:51,020
are you looking at stinks that came out?
I'm a grown man that just,

2458
01:51:51,290 --> 01:51:53,020
I didn't get.
I didn't say like,

2459
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:58,260
oh,
let me ask her if she's licking her 

2460
01:51:58,260 --> 01:51:58,260
stinkies.

2461
01:51:58,260 --> 01:51:58,260
I just went,
why steam?

2462
01:51:58,260 --> 01:51:58,260
I don't know.
It wasn't even stinky.

2463
01:51:58,260 --> 01:51:58,630
It was like pinkies.
I was like,

2464
01:51:59,310 --> 01:52:01,590
geez,
have you called keys before?

2465
01:52:01,750 --> 01:52:04,600
Now it just came at me,
but then I was like,

2466
01:52:04,601 --> 01:52:07,400
maybe this is me.
I'm alone with my dog.

2467
01:52:07,401 --> 01:52:10,720
Like maybe I packed like this.
Like maybe this is my truth.

2468
01:52:11,230 --> 01:52:13,890
I have a dog that's about to die.
Sorry.

2469
01:52:13,891 --> 01:52:16,240
I have one of my,
one of my dogs is 13.

2470
01:52:16,241 --> 01:52:20,620
He's a massive and he's really bad.
He can't walk anymore.

2471
01:52:20,970 --> 01:52:24,220
And it takes like for him to come in to 
eat.

2472
01:52:24,550 --> 01:52:28,600
It takes several minutes,
several minutes of him walking,

2473
01:52:28,630 --> 01:52:29,920
you know,
five,

2474
01:52:29,930 --> 01:52:34,930
six yards.
It's like we adopt these terminally ill 

2475
01:52:34,930 --> 01:52:38,401
children because you get attached to 
them like kids and you wouldn't adopt a 

2476
01:52:38,401 --> 01:52:39,010
kid.
Is gonna die at 14?

2477
01:52:39,250 --> 01:52:44,250
Well,
I have him and I have another dog is 

2478
01:52:44,250 --> 01:52:44,250
also very old.
Who's a shibu.

2479
01:52:44,250 --> 01:52:46,220
He knew english max.
He's a little

2480
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:46,970
bit better,
but he's,

2481
01:52:47,630 --> 01:52:50,360
he's not gonna make it or either don't 
have a long.

2482
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:55,450
He's got real problems walking as well.
But then I have marshall who's a year 

2483
01:52:56,031 --> 01:52:59,180
and six months and he's a golden 
retriever,

2484
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:04,360
is the total opposite.
He just fucking leaps into the pool and 

2485
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:08,411
it runs around the pool and circles and 
he goes running with me and the hills 

2486
01:53:08,411 --> 01:53:11,981
and he's a fuckIng.
Just a ball of energy and love and 

2487
01:53:11,981 --> 01:53:13,850
happiness and you just get to see him at
this stage.

2488
01:53:13,851 --> 01:53:14,630
And I'm like,
damn,

2489
01:53:14,631 --> 01:53:17,300
one day marshall's going to be 13.
I'm going to see marshall.

2490
01:53:17,690 --> 01:53:19,420
Like these dogs.
It's gonna.

2491
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:21,440
It's gonna be a,
just a giant struggle.

2492
01:53:21,570 --> 01:53:24,980
So it's hard to really hard.
I've been fucking hard man.

2493
01:53:25,310 --> 01:53:25,950
I don't know.
Uh,

2494
01:53:26,010 --> 01:53:28,370
it looks like to have kids,
but I feel like very,

2495
01:53:28,371 --> 01:53:30,410
I get really attached to me.
My dogs.

2496
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:32,030
Yeah.
Yeah.

2497
01:53:32,031 --> 01:53:36,590
It's that times a million with kids.
It's that times 2 million.

2498
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:38,690
One of the things that changed with me 
is,

2499
01:53:38,730 --> 01:53:43,730
uh,
the way I look at people because I 

2500
01:53:43,730 --> 01:53:43,730
always considered people just,
you know,

2501
01:53:43,730 --> 01:53:45,080
I meet you,
you're 47.

2502
01:53:45,081 --> 01:53:46,790
I just,
well kyle's 47.

2503
01:53:46,850 --> 01:53:48,470
It's what he is,
but I don't,

2504
01:53:48,471 --> 01:53:50,710
I didn't know you when you were two,
you know,

2505
01:53:50,780 --> 01:53:53,150
and now when I meet people and I meet 
people,

2506
01:53:53,151 --> 01:53:56,090
like I meet some old asshole all like 
that old dickhead,

2507
01:53:56,430 --> 01:53:58,670
he's a little baby.
Oh,

2508
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:01,550
he was a baby and he became this old 
dickhead.

2509
01:54:01,970 --> 01:54:03,920
Like how did this happen?
Like what,

2510
01:54:04,310 --> 01:54:07,970
what went wrong?
And I'm so much more compassionate.

2511
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:12,110
I'm so much more.
I care about people so much more.

2512
01:54:12,111 --> 01:54:15,140
And I care about,
I think I give them more of a break.

2513
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:20,200
I give people way more of a board and I 
noticed this is something that I don't 

2514
01:54:20,631 --> 01:54:25,631
see as much in single guys who don't 
have children.

2515
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:26,930
Yeah,
you don't,

2516
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:29,060
you know,
like there's something about it that the

2517
01:54:29,061 --> 01:54:33,200
world is dog eat dog,
you're competing for your career,

2518
01:54:33,201 --> 01:54:38,201
you're competing for love interests,
you're competing for this and that and 

2519
01:54:38,201 --> 01:54:39,280
everybody's like,
fuck that guy.

2520
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:41,620
Fuck him.
And everybody's trying to get nobody's.

2521
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:43,400
Nobody looks at people and go,
oh,

2522
01:54:43,401 --> 01:54:45,120
that could have been my son.
Yeah,

2523
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:49,970
that's a little baby that became this 
weirdo 28 year old man.

2524
01:54:49,971 --> 01:54:51,590
That's one thing I hear about having 
kids.

2525
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:56,680
That is very attractive to me that it 
does shift your perspective and 

2526
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:58,640
massively as whole new,
massively.

2527
01:54:58,641 --> 01:55:03,641
11 life changed who I am,
changed who I am and it just it and 

2528
01:55:03,641 --> 01:55:08,200
permanently.
You scare me about that autistic thing 

2529
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:08,200
though.
Really?

2530
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:08,200
Well,
it's real.

2531
01:55:08,300 --> 01:55:10,700
You know,
there's a correlation.

2532
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:15,200
There's a correlation between older men 
and higher incidences of autism.

2533
01:55:15,260 --> 01:55:19,040
You get the percentages,
you got some statistics here for you.

2534
01:55:19,340 --> 01:55:21,380
Great.
I mean,

2535
01:55:21,381 --> 01:55:26,381
look,
a lot of people do it and they're fine 

2536
01:55:26,381 --> 01:55:26,780
and it's going to help for sure that 
your gals a young,

2537
01:55:26,781 --> 01:55:28,000
she's not even 30.
Yeah.

2538
01:55:28,380 --> 01:55:29,450
Yeah.
Shoot,

2539
01:55:29,510 --> 01:55:33,380
shoot live one done there.
One right down the old tube.

2540
01:55:33,660 --> 01:55:36,370
Red get,
just get to two years,

2541
01:55:36,980 --> 01:55:38,750
get to two years.
You guys have been together a year and a

2542
01:55:38,751 --> 01:55:39,530
half.
Yeah.

2543
01:55:39,650 --> 01:55:41,420
Yeah.
Make it to two years almost.

2544
01:55:41,930 --> 01:55:44,220
Yeah.
Years when to remove

2545
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:46,450
the goalie.
Oh shoot.

2546
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:48,330
Pucks,
bam,

2547
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:49,260
bam.
Bam.

2548
01:55:49,261 --> 01:55:54,261
From the free throw line and yeah,
it seems like an important life 

2549
01:55:57,691 --> 01:55:59,880
experience.
I did have.

2550
01:55:59,970 --> 01:56:02,070
It is in.
It's not for everybody.

2551
01:56:02,071 --> 01:56:07,071
And one of the things that used to drive
me crazy when I was single is people 

2552
01:56:07,071 --> 01:56:07,071
would say,
uh,

2553
01:56:07,071 --> 01:56:08,190
you know,
you have to have kids.

2554
01:56:08,191 --> 01:56:10,020
You don't have kids.
You don't live in a normal life.

2555
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:13,210
That's crazy.
That's so stupId that,

2556
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:18,280
that is such a,
like the idea that you can't be a 

2557
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:18,280
complete human being unless you 
recreate,

2558
01:56:19,890 --> 01:56:24,890
recreate,
recreate a word I'm looking for 

2559
01:56:24,890 --> 01:56:24,890
reproduced.
Why?

2560
01:56:24,890 --> 01:56:28,840
Why?
How come that where it wouldn't come 

2561
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:28,840
out.
It's not that far off though.

2562
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:29,660
Recreated.
A mother may.

2563
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:32,040
Well,
why wasn't reproduced like right there.

2564
01:56:32,190 --> 01:56:36,480
I was having trouble with a anecdote,
the antidote anecdote,

2565
01:56:36,481 --> 01:56:41,481
but there's a super close but the,
that you can be a fucking completely 

2566
01:56:41,761 --> 01:56:45,060
fulfilled person and never get married 
and never have a kid.

2567
01:56:45,090 --> 01:56:48,930
You just have to have good friends and 
enjoy what you do.

2568
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:51,880
There's nothing wrong with that 
phrasing.

2569
01:56:52,070 --> 01:56:54,240
Yeah,
it's a little what I just remember being

2570
01:56:54,241 --> 01:56:57,360
a kid and like my uncle like wasn't 
married or had kids.

2571
01:56:57,370 --> 01:57:00,490
I was always like,
what's up with them?

2572
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:02,900
Smart.
That guy partying,

2573
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:06,600
going to bill maher route.
Do you?

2574
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:10,120
But without getting me into the alarm.
Do you have a bill maher character?

2575
01:57:10,930 --> 01:57:12,310
Right?
You do.

2576
01:57:12,330 --> 01:57:17,330
I saw you did it.
You went to those people who thinks she 

2577
01:57:17,330 --> 01:57:17,530
wouldn't have those people.
You're not okay.

2578
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:19,750
You're wrong.

2579
01:57:21,890 --> 01:57:24,330
There is no god.
Okay.

2580
01:57:26,830 --> 01:57:31,830
It's very like,
I know everything I do agree with a lot 

2581
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:33,270
of.
He says,

2582
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:35,220
yeah,
he's a smart guy.

2583
01:57:35,910 --> 01:57:38,460
That shows a weird show.
Everybody talking over each other.

2584
01:57:39,090 --> 01:57:42,840
five people on panel,
whatever it is for you over the phone.

2585
01:57:43,170 --> 01:57:44,850
So many People.
Do you see the uh,

2586
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:46,710
ben aflac one?
Yes.

2587
01:57:46,711 --> 01:57:49,560
With sam harris.
Sam is a friend who loves sam.

2588
01:57:49,890 --> 01:57:51,480
I love sam to.
That was hilarious.

2589
01:57:52,050 --> 01:57:56,720
I think ben,
I think ben affleck was roided up right?

2590
01:57:56,860 --> 01:58:01,860
I really had that energy,
but he also was like kind of red and 

2591
01:58:01,860 --> 01:58:02,430
thick.
Neck was thick,

2592
01:58:02,431 --> 01:58:03,330
like,
listen,

2593
01:58:03,540 --> 01:58:08,540
when you're 40,
whatever the fuck he is and you want to 

2594
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:09,660
Pack on that kind of muscles.
It was only one way.

2595
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:15,470
You gotta fucking take that plunger.
Oops.

2596
01:58:15,550 --> 01:58:16,590
Shoot.
Yeah.

2597
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:22,040
That's what I think.
I think he was juiced up and I think he 

2598
01:58:22,040 --> 01:58:24,531
just was hyper aggressive virtue 
signaling and really didn't even know 

2599
01:58:24,531 --> 01:58:27,570
what the fuck he was talking about and 
clearly picked the wrong guy.

2600
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:31,380
Oh my god.
I would never argue with sam harris.

2601
01:58:31,381 --> 01:58:36,381
I think about it.
I think like the fact that he can't be 

2602
01:58:36,381 --> 01:58:38,691
president really pisses me off.
Like why can't I want a guy who's 

2603
01:58:38,691 --> 01:58:38,691
smarter than me?
Well,

2604
01:58:38,691 --> 01:58:41,160
he could be president.
I don't think being an atheist.

2605
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:43,390
Maybe not.
Yeah.

2606
01:58:43,660 --> 01:58:45,370
It's like,
why did I get.

2607
01:58:45,430 --> 01:58:47,360
I don't get this whole thing of like,
I want to.

2608
01:58:47,361 --> 01:58:49,390
I don't want to vote for this guy.
I can relate to him.

2609
01:58:49,391 --> 01:58:50,070
He's like,
mate,

2610
01:58:50,140 --> 01:58:55,140
I don't want a guy like me.
It's like when a babysitter like I want 

2611
01:58:55,140 --> 01:58:57,130
to babysit.
I want someone who's superior exactly.

2612
01:58:57,131 --> 01:58:59,200
Smarter,
come in.

2613
01:58:59,230 --> 01:59:04,230
He's very meditative.
Sam and mom and I firmly believe no one 

2614
01:59:04,230 --> 01:59:05,470
should be president.
I think there should be a council.

2615
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:07,120
Oh,
wise people.

2616
01:59:07,510 --> 01:59:12,510
I love that idea.
Like the jedi council fucking eight 

2617
01:59:12,510 --> 01:59:12,510
people or something.

2618
01:59:12,510 --> 01:59:17,190
Just really,
really smart people that have no idea 

2619
01:59:17,190 --> 01:59:17,590
and I think they should all have had to 
do mushrooms.

2620
01:59:17,740 --> 01:59:21,580
All of them I think about that have to 
do psychedelic experiences.

2621
01:59:22,070 --> 01:59:23,370
All of them.
They should be high.

2622
01:59:23,410 --> 01:59:26,170
Can it not do mushrooms while they're on
the job,

2623
01:59:26,171 --> 01:59:31,171
but have in the past where they 
understand there's more to life than 

2624
01:59:31,171 --> 01:59:31,480
this thing.
That's part of the platform.

2625
01:59:31,690 --> 01:59:34,570
The person needs to be like,
I did try mushrooms,

2626
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:39,600
didn't know you gotta go deep.
You've got to take the heroic dose.

2627
01:59:39,940 --> 01:59:41,320
Okay.
Yeah,

2628
01:59:41,350 --> 01:59:42,330
yeah.
I'd love that idea.

2629
01:59:42,340 --> 01:59:43,830
Like a little think tank.
Yeah.

2630
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:45,760
Eight people,
super wise people.

2631
01:59:45,790 --> 01:59:48,620
I don't really think the mushroom thing 
is necessary but,

2632
01:59:48,910 --> 01:59:53,910
but consider it wise,
objective people that care and have a 

2633
01:59:56,290 --> 02:00:01,290
deep,
a deep sense of responsibility to sort 

2634
02:00:02,081 --> 02:00:05,590
of guide our country and the best way 
possible.

2635
02:00:05,650 --> 02:00:07,270
I probably done for their own interests.

2636
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:10,030
Exactly.
I put neil degrasse tyson on this.

2637
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:16,400
Well,
you'd be great for some sort of a role 

2638
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:16,400
as a science educator and the government
anyway.

2639
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:16,960
It's just some old.
He.

2640
02:00:16,990 --> 02:00:21,990
What?
What's great about neil is he's one of 

2641
02:00:21,990 --> 02:00:23,440
the first guys in our lifetime that made
science fun,

2642
02:00:24,250 --> 02:00:29,250
made,
made astrophysics interest so 

2643
02:00:29,250 --> 02:00:29,680
enthusiastic.
He's a great guy.

2644
02:00:29,681 --> 02:00:31,870
I fucking love it.
If we have aliens,

2645
02:00:31,970 --> 02:00:33,640
like we got to send one guy.
Oh,

2646
02:00:33,641 --> 02:00:36,100
he's the guy elliot said neil degrasse 
tyson.

2647
02:00:36,120 --> 02:00:37,540
Well,
he's also even,

2648
02:00:37,570 --> 02:00:42,160
even though like he'll be talking to 
someone who is,

2649
02:00:42,250 --> 02:00:45,460
you know,
just doesn't really understand what he's

2650
02:00:45,461 --> 02:00:50,461
saying.
He's not an elitist exactly the way he 

2651
02:00:50,461 --> 02:00:54,100
argues.
He's caring about guiding him and he's a

2652
02:00:54,101 --> 02:00:56,440
master at it.
He's a really likable guy,

2653
02:00:56,441 --> 02:01:01,441
but he is like that all the time.
Like he's like that when the camera's 

2654
02:01:01,441 --> 02:01:06,241
off.
He's just a great guy and one quality 

2655
02:01:06,241 --> 02:01:06,241
has.

2656
02:01:06,241 --> 02:01:08,880
It.
Rarely does someone who's like really 

2657
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:08,880
smart habits.
He's a big laffer.

2658
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:08,880
Yeah,
yeah,

2659
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:09,670
yeah,
yeah.

2660
02:01:09,910 --> 02:01:10,980
It's like no.
Her acumen,

2661
02:01:11,110 --> 02:01:11,980
fun guy,
you know,

2662
02:01:11,981 --> 02:01:13,600
he used to be a wrestler talking about 
mushrooms.

2663
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:15,820
He used to be a wrestler.
Really?

2664
02:01:15,850 --> 02:01:16,990
Hey,
wrestled in high school.

2665
02:01:16,991 --> 02:01:20,710
He was like that.
I think he wrestled in college too.

2666
02:01:21,100 --> 02:01:23,650
He was jacked,
like fucking jacked.

2667
02:01:24,250 --> 02:01:27,760
He's an all around a quality human.
Yes.

2668
02:01:28,090 --> 02:01:30,640
Sam harris to the way he argues,
just stays calm.

2669
02:01:32,350 --> 02:01:33,640
Well,
he doesn't argue about things he doesn't

2670
02:01:33,641 --> 02:01:35,280
understand either.
You know,

2671
02:01:35,340 --> 02:01:39,980
like if sam has a conversation and uh,
say like he's

2672
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:43,220
having a conversation with someone about
whatever the fuck it is.

2673
02:01:43,850 --> 02:01:48,850
Some,
some discipline that's outside of his 

2674
02:01:48,850 --> 02:01:48,850
realm.
And then,

2675
02:01:48,850 --> 02:01:48,850
you know,
he'll,

2676
02:01:48,850 --> 02:01:49,800
he'll ask questions like he doesn't 
have,

2677
02:01:49,850 --> 02:01:51,380
he's not,
he's not a know it all.

2678
02:01:51,410 --> 02:01:53,240
That's how you learn,
will forget.

2679
02:01:53,660 --> 02:01:56,030
But if he's talking to you about 
something and he's arguing,

2680
02:01:56,031 --> 02:01:57,790
it's because he understands what he's 
talking about.

2681
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:02,800
But that's a rare quality man.
There's so many people that want to 

2682
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:02,840
argue about shit that they really don't 
even understand.

2683
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:05,240
You know?
And I don't think there's anything wrong

2684
02:02:05,241 --> 02:02:10,241
with discussing things that you really 
don't understand to try to understand 

2685
02:02:10,241 --> 02:02:13,061
them,
especially if you're doing it in a 

2686
02:02:13,061 --> 02:02:15,490
casual conversation or even a podcast.
But there's a lot of fucking people that

2687
02:02:15,741 --> 02:02:17,960
argue shit and they're just trying to 
win,

2688
02:02:18,410 --> 02:02:20,030
you know,
they're just trying to score points.

2689
02:02:21,170 --> 02:02:22,850
They're not really talking right.

2690
02:02:22,940 --> 02:02:24,140
He got a lot of that,
right.

2691
02:02:24,300 --> 02:02:29,150
I do it a lot,
but I'm more aware of it.

2692
02:02:29,180 --> 02:02:31,100
Watching people who were,
who don't do it.

2693
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:34,400
You learned a pizza,
normal tHing.

2694
02:02:34,401 --> 02:02:37,790
You get caught up in your idea and then 
you want your idea to be right.

2695
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:42,840
Yeah.
And then you kinda like chase down all 

2696
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:42,840
the evidence that would show that your 
ideas,

2697
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:46,960
riGht?
You see this all the time when someone 

2698
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:48,210
gets accused of something and we don't 
know exactly what happened.

2699
02:02:48,211 --> 02:02:53,211
DO you see these groups of people that 
automatically want to think that person 

2700
02:02:53,211 --> 02:02:56,090
is guilty and automatically have a 
preconceived idea of what went down,

2701
02:02:56,091 --> 02:03:01,091
how it went down,
regardless of what the other person 

2702
02:03:01,091 --> 02:03:03,521
said.
Like they only want to look at it one 

2703
02:03:03,521 --> 02:03:03,521
way.
Just gets weird,

2704
02:03:03,521 --> 02:03:07,290
real weird with people harder now to all
the information you have to be,

2705
02:03:07,330 --> 02:03:08,450
have to be a little more.

2706
02:03:08,610 --> 02:03:11,060
Um,
you know,

2707
02:03:11,061 --> 02:03:12,320
what,
hashtag fake news.

2708
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:13,640
Hashtag,
hashtag.

2709
02:03:14,360 --> 02:03:15,830
I'll come back,
I'll get smarter.

2710
02:03:15,831 --> 02:03:18,320
And come back,
what kind of smart you're going to get.

2711
02:03:18,321 --> 02:03:20,060
Book smart.
I get sam harris,

2712
02:03:20,210 --> 02:03:25,210
neil degrasse tYson smart.
If I gave you a pill and the pill would 

2713
02:03:25,210 --> 02:03:25,820
make you super smart but you wouldn't be
fun anymore,

2714
02:03:25,910 --> 02:03:29,210
would you take it?
What would I be happy?

2715
02:03:30,040 --> 02:03:35,040
Those are the same.
No one can decide whether or not you're 

2716
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:35,040
going to be happy,
but you.

2717
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:36,870
What am I going to do it again?
That's up to you again.

2718
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:41,990
I don't think I would take,
I think do torture and said,

2719
02:03:42,170 --> 02:03:43,970
hey,
would you stay stupid?

2720
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:47,750
HalF retarded and funny.
Very little oxygen.

2721
02:03:47,751 --> 02:03:50,450
When I was born was Purple and they were
like,

2722
02:03:50,451 --> 02:03:53,390
this one might come out a little goofy 
and we have to wait and see if he starts

2723
02:03:53,430 --> 02:03:55,310
talking and then I started talking like,
oh,

2724
02:03:55,320 --> 02:03:58,130
he's all right really?
But I have a theory that like I was born

2725
02:03:58,131 --> 02:04:00,200
a genius,
got a little retarded.

2726
02:04:00,860 --> 02:04:02,090
I'm like kind of normal.

2727
02:04:04,100 --> 02:04:09,100
It's just a theory.
But my genius came up with it not be a 

2728
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:11,600
bad theory mean what a roll of the dice,
whether you're,

2729
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:15,530
you're born super smart or not.
So roll the dice.

2730
02:04:15,990 --> 02:04:20,990
Oh,
some people that just have better 

2731
02:04:20,990 --> 02:04:20,990
brains.
Yeah.

2732
02:04:20,990 --> 02:04:20,990
There's some people that are just really
good at math.

2733
02:04:20,990 --> 02:04:22,910
Like I used to have to a friend,
my friend johnny.

2734
02:04:23,090 --> 02:04:25,030
You could just yell out math problems to
them.

2735
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:30,500
Yeah.
Like five times five minus six divided 

2736
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:33,101
by seven multiplied by 100 divided by 
three and he would go 16.

2737
02:04:33,620 --> 02:04:35,300
You'd be like,
what the fuck?

2738
02:04:35,301 --> 02:04:37,680
And like someone would be sitting next 
to him with a calculator

2739
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:42,980
and they would like try to keep up.
He could do it as fast as someone can 

2740
02:04:42,980 --> 02:04:42,980
type it in with a calculator.
Yeah.

2741
02:04:42,980 --> 02:04:46,590
It was bizarre and useless talents.
Talents have calculators.

2742
02:04:46,591 --> 02:04:50,070
Asshole.
Born 200 years ago.

2743
02:04:50,071 --> 02:04:54,650
Batteries are everywhere.
So batteries.

2744
02:04:54,660 --> 02:04:56,000
We need you.
Yeah.

2745
02:04:56,030 --> 02:04:59,460
That's a calculator on my phone.
My phone as a calculator.

2746
02:04:59,580 --> 02:05:01,590
Not to bring up sam harris again.
But that whole like,

2747
02:05:01,591 --> 02:05:02,280
um,
you know,

2748
02:05:02,430 --> 02:05:04,440
freewill book,
um,

2749
02:05:04,980 --> 02:05:06,250
you know,
that kinda.

2750
02:05:06,460 --> 02:05:07,200
That's a mind.
Fuck.

2751
02:05:07,230 --> 02:05:12,230
That's.
It really is because your mind doesn't 

2752
02:05:12,230 --> 02:05:12,230
want to believe that.
It's just not.

2753
02:05:12,230 --> 02:05:16,200
It's like not believing in heaven.
You want to believe that it's hard to.

2754
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:22,200
It's just hard.
But there's definitely so much luck 

2755
02:05:22,200 --> 02:05:24,120
involved in who your parents were,
how you were raised life experiences,

2756
02:05:24,150 --> 02:05:25,560
for sure.
You know,

2757
02:05:25,740 --> 02:05:28,830
whether or not you've ever been attacked
or assaulted,

2758
02:05:28,860 --> 02:05:33,860
robbed a,
whether you've been in an accident or 

2759
02:05:33,860 --> 02:05:33,900
you got gravely injured.

2760
02:05:33,930 --> 02:05:36,030
There's so many variables that are just 
fortunate.

2761
02:05:36,520 --> 02:05:37,950
Just luck.
Yeah.

2762
02:05:37,951 --> 02:05:39,810
There's so many.
It'd be just someone danced with.

2763
02:05:41,290 --> 02:05:43,890
Mom was wedding.
Whatever.

2764
02:05:44,490 --> 02:05:45,000
Yeah.
There's,

2765
02:05:45,690 --> 02:05:48,000
there's so many things that you just 
fucking luck.

2766
02:05:48,030 --> 02:05:49,680
Well look,
we're all lucky we're here.

2767
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:52,320
We weren't born in the jungles of 
Guatemala or somewhere.

2768
02:05:52,321 --> 02:05:53,430
Absolutely.
Yeah.

2769
02:05:53,431 --> 02:05:54,710
We're just lucky me.
You're,

2770
02:05:54,720 --> 02:05:59,720
you're,
you want a huge one in a trillion 

2771
02:05:59,720 --> 02:05:59,720
lottery to be born.
Yeah.

2772
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:03,650
And then to be born in the us at this 
time that we have air conditioning and 

2773
02:06:03,650 --> 02:06:05,410
gps.
Why don't we revere science more that if

2774
02:06:05,470 --> 02:06:06,840
there's a god,
he's saying,

2775
02:06:06,870 --> 02:06:09,270
I'm rewarding you every time you listen 
to science.

2776
02:06:10,050 --> 02:06:13,530
And yet so much of religion is like a 
against science.

2777
02:06:13,590 --> 02:06:14,520
I don't know.
Look,

2778
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:17,610
I don't think science is a saying,
hey,

2779
02:06:17,670 --> 02:06:20,040
nobody comes back from the dead after 
three days.

2780
02:06:20,041 --> 02:06:22,110
Hey,
people can't really walk on water.

2781
02:06:22,111 --> 02:06:23,230
Hey,
uh,

2782
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:26,160
why did he turn water into wine?
Why don't he just make wine?

2783
02:06:26,161 --> 02:06:27,930
He's fucking magic.

2784
02:06:30,060 --> 02:06:33,480
I never thought of that.
Stop with the magic trick,

2785
02:06:33,481 --> 02:06:35,130
bro.
We try to get fucked up.

2786
02:06:35,131 --> 02:06:38,430
Just make us tired of wine.
Got any whiskey in that.

2787
02:06:38,740 --> 02:06:41,550
Those magic robes get the miracles of 
worst,

2788
02:06:41,551 --> 02:06:44,520
sort of like they're fucking parlor 
tricks.

2789
02:06:44,521 --> 02:06:46,600
His miracles are horrible.
You know,

2790
02:06:46,870 --> 02:06:51,870
it was the best.
There was a thing back in the eighties 

2791
02:06:51,870 --> 02:06:54,440
called the power team for jesus and what
they were with these dudes that would do

2792
02:06:54,451 --> 02:06:57,690
like feats of strength for jesus.
Like they would,

2793
02:06:57,691 --> 02:07:02,691
uh,
they would fucking break bricks with 

2794
02:07:02,691 --> 02:07:02,691
their head.
They would rip phone books and half they

2795
02:07:02,691 --> 02:07:04,830
would lift up heavy weights.
Do it for jesus.

2796
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:06,690
Wow.
That jesus gave him the power.

2797
02:07:06,710 --> 02:07:07,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

2798
02:07:07,710 --> 02:07:09,330
But it was also like,
hey dude,

2799
02:07:09,331 --> 02:07:11,400
jesus,
he's magic.

2800
02:07:11,430 --> 02:07:16,430
He's got magic.
Like he's not going to be impressed by 

2801
02:07:16,430 --> 02:07:16,430
you breaking a board with your extra 
thick skull.

2802
02:07:16,430 --> 02:07:20,280
You fucking wow.
Look at one of my children down there.

2803
02:07:20,340 --> 02:07:22,200
Have you never heard of them?
No,

2804
02:07:22,201 --> 02:07:23,850
I dude,
I used to watch them all the time.

2805
02:07:23,851 --> 02:07:28,851
They were all like this religious 
channel and I used to watch the power 

2806
02:07:28,851 --> 02:07:29,940
team for jesus going,
what in the fuck is this?

2807
02:07:29,941 --> 02:07:32,550
That's amazing.
It was so How have you found anything on

2808
02:07:32,551 --> 02:07:36,320
it?
I found a good one to just.

2809
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:40,730
Those guYs are the third street 
promenade team for genius.

2810
02:07:40,810 --> 02:07:43,140
Jesus.
Yeah.

2811
02:07:43,170 --> 02:07:43,410
See

2812
02:07:43,780 --> 02:07:48,780
iT braked brick this brick for the load 
for sure.

2813
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:55,220
they're called devil.
oh,

2814
02:07:57,420 --> 02:08:00,120
my head.
Oh yeah,

2815
02:08:00,710 --> 02:08:04,010
he kicked it.
Oh,

2816
02:08:04,270 --> 02:08:06,520
whoa.
It seems a little too easy to break.

2817
02:08:06,521 --> 02:08:08,500
Those were really making a mess for 
jesus.

2818
02:08:08,670 --> 02:08:10,060
Literally drops it.
Elbow download.

2819
02:08:10,090 --> 02:08:13,120
I'm going to blow up this balloon and 
blow it up until it explodes.

2820
02:08:13,121 --> 02:08:16,390
That's why they have to wear goggles on,
but yeah,

2821
02:08:16,420 --> 02:08:18,200
it's a bladder.
That's not.

2822
02:08:18,600 --> 02:08:20,920
This trick is not great.
oh wow.

2823
02:08:20,950 --> 02:08:21,940
Actually,
right in the face.

2824
02:08:23,530 --> 02:08:24,790
Stupid song.
Boom.

2825
02:08:25,180 --> 02:08:26,620
Here comes the boom.

2826
02:08:26,790 --> 02:08:28,360
I ripped a phone,
but what's that?

2827
02:08:28,890 --> 02:08:30,560
Was that.
I thought it was pod.

2828
02:08:30,561 --> 02:08:32,720
That's saliva pod as a christian rock 
band.

2829
02:08:32,810 --> 02:08:33,890
Pod.
Pod.

2830
02:08:34,100 --> 02:08:37,100
Payable on death was the goal of 
christian rock.

2831
02:08:37,101 --> 02:08:38,340
Yeah.
That's like,

2832
02:08:38,341 --> 02:08:39,940
um.
They have some great fucking song.

2833
02:08:42,590 --> 02:08:43,520
Here comes the boom.

2834
02:08:44,240 --> 02:08:49,240
Yeah.
It's brooke's ripping up phone books in 

2835
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:49,240
half for jesus.
Look at this.

2836
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:50,270
It's bended a bar for jesus is going to 
love this,

2837
02:08:50,390 --> 02:08:51,950
and by the way,
this is a.

2838
02:08:52,250 --> 02:08:55,670
This is a newer power team.
This is not the original power team.

2839
02:08:55,910 --> 02:08:57,260
Power came two point zero.
Oh,

2840
02:08:57,261 --> 02:08:58,160
is it?
Well,

2841
02:08:58,161 --> 02:08:59,870
the older guys are dead from steroids.

2842
02:09:01,430 --> 02:09:04,990
1990 jesus.
Now this is a 1991.

2843
02:09:04,991 --> 02:09:07,360
Yeah.
This huddle look at is.

2844
02:09:07,420 --> 02:09:11,080
Look at the fuCking mall at bro.
Shaved armpits by the way.

2845
02:09:11,370 --> 02:09:13,410
notice that,
right?

2846
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:17,830
That just loves to look at the pants.
Those puffy pants,

2847
02:09:18,010 --> 02:09:19,540
those gym pants.
Hold on.

2848
02:09:19,630 --> 02:09:20,200
What's he saying?

2849
02:09:22,330 --> 02:09:25,540
Oh my friends were inside the door.
Shut behind me.

2850
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:26,560
Where's your video,
bro?

2851
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:31,800
Door shut.
Jesus took the blinders,

2852
02:09:33,590 --> 02:09:38,590
enrolled them right off my eyes and 
inside of that bar for the first time in

2853
02:09:39,681 --> 02:09:44,681
my life,
I saw the world for what it really had 

2854
02:09:44,681 --> 02:09:46,340
to offer me he wanted.
It was a big fat zero.

2855
02:09:47,120 --> 02:09:50,210
I got in my car.
I drove home with my wife.

2856
02:09:50,420 --> 02:09:53,870
We got inside our apartment.
My wife went and sat on the couch,

2857
02:09:54,020 --> 02:09:55,910
hiGh paced back and forth in the living 
room,

2858
02:09:56,990 --> 02:10:01,990
chain down everything to world pass by 
him and I was chained down.

2859
02:10:03,640 --> 02:10:08,210
I've looked all my life and body for 
people were put pro wrestling's a little

2860
02:10:08,590 --> 02:10:08,880
tube

2861
02:10:11,090 --> 02:10:16,090
without the other guy.
For people who think progressing is too 

2862
02:10:16,090 --> 02:10:16,520
complicated,
like I don't get what they're saying.

2863
02:10:16,521 --> 02:10:18,470
And pro wrestling.
There's too many people.

2864
02:10:18,471 --> 02:10:20,750
Too many moving pieces.
It hurts my brain.

2865
02:10:21,080 --> 02:10:22,340
I like this.
Yeah.

2866
02:10:22,370 --> 02:10:24,260
That was a huge crowd.
Dude.

2867
02:10:24,261 --> 02:10:27,500
That's like 20 plus thousand people.
It plays a giant.

2868
02:10:28,450 --> 02:10:29,810
Oh,
I'm the wrong business.

2869
02:10:29,811 --> 02:10:30,120
Yeah.
Look,

2870
02:10:30,210 --> 02:10:31,910
they lift things up for,
for the lord.

2871
02:10:31,940 --> 02:10:32,450
Oh,
what happened?

2872
02:10:32,451 --> 02:10:33,230
The mallet,
bro.

2873
02:10:33,710 --> 02:10:36,320
Get the fuck is.
He didn't jump rope.

2874
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:41,360
Looks bigger to.
He did more roids and got rid of his 

2875
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:42,920
head.
Grew his foreheads larger.

2876
02:10:43,820 --> 02:10:46,850
MultIple per.
They're going to throw him into a pit or

2877
02:10:46,851 --> 02:10:46,970
something.

2878
02:10:49,710 --> 02:10:51,690
This is crazy.
Oh,

2879
02:10:52,380 --> 02:10:55,200
I wonder if it has the same speech or if
he gives a different one every time.

2880
02:10:56,520 --> 02:10:59,060
Oh,
that's the same guy bro.

2881
02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:02,780
Molokais right behind them.
Now he's got the chains on there.

2882
02:11:02,781 --> 02:11:04,580
The same human.
Yeah,

2883
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:07,580
the same guy that it's a clone tag team 
partner.

2884
02:11:08,330 --> 02:11:11,030
Maybe they're twins.
They're tag team partners.

2885
02:11:12,190 --> 02:11:13,520
Oh,
christ.

2886
02:11:13,700 --> 02:11:16,280
Ladies and gentlemen,
are you committed to god?

2887
02:11:16,630 --> 02:11:18,140
The more you'll be committed to each 
other,

2888
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:21,620
you'll never understand commitment.
The first time I ever saw them was jerry

2889
02:11:21,621 --> 02:11:26,621
springer or something.
They had a smash put jesus on jerry 

2890
02:11:26,931 --> 02:11:28,070
springer.
Sometimes.

2891
02:11:28,110 --> 02:11:29,540
You know,
they had to find out who's the baby?

2892
02:11:30,190 --> 02:11:32,330
Maury maury was.
Who's the baby daddy?

2893
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:34,780
Yeah,
yeah,

2894
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:36,770
yeah,
yeah,

2895
02:11:36,820 --> 02:11:37,720
yeah.
Here's your baby daddy.

2896
02:11:37,750 --> 02:11:40,890
Huh?
Has anybody contacted you from them?

2897
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:43,200
The kardashians?
No.

2898
02:11:43,300 --> 02:11:45,610
What would you do and everything slid 
into your dmz.

2899
02:11:45,620 --> 02:11:48,450
you saw dm and was kanye and you see the
blue check mark.

2900
02:11:48,460 --> 02:11:50,200
You're like,
oh jesus christ.

2901
02:11:50,590 --> 02:11:55,590
I would sNap a photo and I'm tired.
I'm tired of caitlin to be on my side 

2902
02:11:56,820 --> 02:11:59,020
quarter.
Yeah,

2903
02:11:59,560 --> 02:12:01,970
I would love that.
Would you obviously a.

2904
02:12:02,500 --> 02:12:03,880
no.
I mean I feel like.

2905
02:12:04,840 --> 02:12:06,250
Would they be mad?
I don't think they'd be mad.

2906
02:12:06,550 --> 02:12:11,550
Whenever I do a comedy sPecial,
one of the things that I do is I have a 

2907
02:12:11,550 --> 02:12:11,730
moment of panic after I'm done.
Oh,

2908
02:12:11,731 --> 02:12:16,731
what a calls.
I smoked pot and I get super paranoid 

2909
02:12:16,731 --> 02:12:16,731
and I go,
oh,

2910
02:12:16,731 --> 02:12:21,050
I shouldn't have done that.
But I mean in the last one was my 

2911
02:12:21,050 --> 02:12:22,630
caitlyn jenner bit.
I by the way,

2912
02:12:22,690 --> 02:12:23,950
love that.
When I saw this,

2913
02:12:23,951 --> 02:12:24,330
how,
you know,

2914
02:12:24,340 --> 02:12:24,960
it's a good day.
I was like,

2915
02:12:24,970 --> 02:12:26,940
ah,
I wish I'd thought of that now.

2916
02:12:27,030 --> 02:12:27,880
And you'll,
oh yeah,

2917
02:12:27,881 --> 02:12:29,680
that's the angle.
But it was,

2918
02:12:30,050 --> 02:12:31,890
well I,
I came,

2919
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:36,920
I had to think for so long how to do 
that and the way to it was just to shit 

2920
02:12:37,771 --> 02:12:42,771
on myself first and then also have a lot
of truth in it about how like I've never

2921
02:12:42,841 --> 02:12:43,740
been happier,
but I'm,

2922
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:46,620
I've never been more of a bitch.
I live in a house filled With girls.

2923
02:12:46,621 --> 02:12:48,000
There was all women in my house.
I don't,

2924
02:12:48,390 --> 02:12:53,390
I have zero say in like where things go 
or what color things are.

2925
02:12:53,761 --> 02:12:55,830
It's all,
it's easier to,

2926
02:12:55,860 --> 02:12:59,280
to just let them run out.
I want them to be happy and I don't need

2927
02:12:59,281 --> 02:13:04,281
my masculine energy everywhere.
And that's also one of the nice things 

2928
02:13:04,281 --> 02:13:07,911
about this place.
This place is clearly like a big oldest 

2929
02:13:07,911 --> 02:13:08,010
is a bro,
bro.

2930
02:13:08,310 --> 02:13:10,590
It's a fucking bro warehouse.
But um,

2931
02:13:10,740 --> 02:13:12,420
so I've,
I've felt like,

2932
02:13:12,450 --> 02:13:14,760
oh,
that's the thing because they're turning

2933
02:13:14,761 --> 02:13:16,830
me softer for sure.

2934
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:21,860
Like women living with all these women 
and I've changed the way I communicate 

2935
02:13:21,860 --> 02:13:23,940
and think and behave.
I'm turning into a bitch.

2936
02:13:24,210 --> 02:13:29,210
I'm like,
I've never been more of a bitch in my 

2937
02:13:29,210 --> 02:13:29,210
life.
And so the idea was like if my,

2938
02:13:29,210 --> 02:13:32,000
my manhood was a mountain of marbles,
like every day they take just like,

2939
02:13:32,670 --> 02:13:34,440
what's the big deal?
You have So many marbles,

2940
02:13:34,470 --> 02:13:35,400
god,
dad,

2941
02:13:35,730 --> 02:13:37,380
why do you care?
Why do you even care?

2942
02:13:37,530 --> 02:13:38,420
And then I'm,
I'm like,

2943
02:13:38,421 --> 02:13:40,920
I'm seeing where this is going.
And then I,

2944
02:13:41,010 --> 02:13:42,270
then I said,
okay,

2945
02:13:42,450 --> 02:13:44,460
this is what it is.
That's where the bit is.

2946
02:13:44,461 --> 02:13:47,340
The bit is I'm not going out like bruce 
jenner.

2947
02:13:47,870 --> 02:13:49,770
And then unlike like,
everybody's like,

2948
02:13:49,771 --> 02:13:51,180
he's always been a woman,
like maybe,

2949
02:13:51,570 --> 02:13:56,570
maybe,
or maybe if you live with crazy bitches 

2950
02:13:56,570 --> 02:13:57,150
long enough,
you fucking become one.

2951
02:13:57,420 --> 02:13:59,940
Like kanye.
You don't like what you're saying.

2952
02:13:59,970 --> 02:14:02,700
I don't like what I'm saying.
He's going crazy.

2953
02:14:02,701 --> 02:14:04,770
He's clearly going crazy.
You live with crazy people.

2954
02:14:05,370 --> 02:14:08,960
It's entirely so that bit was one of the
ones where after I released it like,

2955
02:14:09,070 --> 02:14:10,170
oh,
that poor girl,

2956
02:14:10,240 --> 02:14:15,240
she doesn't need me to be pretending 
that she gets reduced by demons in the 

2957
02:14:15,240 --> 02:14:15,240
middle of the night while she's 
sleeping.

2958
02:14:18,870 --> 02:14:23,070
BuT it was so fun to do.
It was also a fucked up it to do because

2959
02:14:23,071 --> 02:14:26,100
in order to do it I literally had to 
think like a demon.

2960
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:31,520
Like I would,
I would think like I was trying to 

2961
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:31,520
seduce her.
It goes,

2962
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:31,770
it goes like whispered in her ear,
like a demon.

2963
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:36,920
Like wow,
there's no effect on the one of us.

2964
02:14:42,270 --> 02:14:43,870
You can just do that.
Yeah,

2965
02:14:44,610 --> 02:14:47,790
that's really hard.
Can I can't be one of you?

2966
02:14:48,040 --> 02:14:51,620
What was born a man?
You see the license old,

2967
02:14:51,770 --> 02:14:56,120
like a footage of the old kardashians 
shows and bruce will come in like,

2968
02:14:56,121 --> 02:14:59,390
yo girls and you're a makeup test off.

2969
02:15:02,490 --> 02:15:04,770
ApparentlY all he was cross dressing 
that whole time.

2970
02:15:05,220 --> 02:15:06,630
Yeah.
Since he was younger.

2971
02:15:07,260 --> 02:15:12,260
You know what the,
there's a theory by one of the guys who 

2972
02:15:12,260 --> 02:15:12,260
was In the olympics with them that,
uh,

2973
02:15:12,260 --> 02:15:12,260
you know,
they had,

2974
02:15:12,330 --> 02:15:14,400
everybody was writing it up back then.
Everybody,

2975
02:15:14,460 --> 02:15:16,860
I mean they just,
they just gave everybody steroids.

2976
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:22,160
And one of the things that happens to 
men when they take large doses of 

2977
02:15:22,160 --> 02:15:23,700
steroids is that your testosterone shuts
down.

2978
02:15:24,240 --> 02:15:26,930
Your body just shuts down.
Oh yeah.

2979
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:30,690
And there's a real.
there's a depression period.

2980
02:15:30,750 --> 02:15:34,260
There's a lot of weird things that 
happen to men.

2981
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:39,320
One of the other things that happens is 
your body starts producing way more 

2982
02:15:39,320 --> 02:15:39,930
estrogen.
You get something called bitch tits.

2983
02:15:40,260 --> 02:15:42,010
Oh,
I received that dose.

2984
02:15:42,110 --> 02:15:43,140
Got no,
it's different.

2985
02:15:43,470 --> 02:15:48,470
It's called gynecoMastia and 
gynecomastia comes from in introducing 

2986
02:15:48,470 --> 02:15:50,400
too much exogenous testosterone into 
your system.

2987
02:15:50,401 --> 02:15:53,370
Your body starts producing estrogen to 
sort of balance it out.

2988
02:15:53,670 --> 02:15:56,490
And in that process you grow tits 
literally.

2989
02:15:56,540 --> 02:15:58,840
Yeah.
So what this person from the.

2990
02:15:59,300 --> 02:16:01,500
I don't remember if they named the 
person who it was,

2991
02:16:01,501 --> 02:16:06,501
but they were saying that all of this 
happened right when bruce got off 

2992
02:16:06,501 --> 02:16:07,710
steroids,
like right after the olympics,

2993
02:16:07,711 --> 02:16:12,711
like you saw these,
this transition taking place where he 

2994
02:16:12,711 --> 02:16:14,280
was just baffled and confused.
I heard that when he was a kid,

2995
02:16:14,281 --> 02:16:17,050
he used to steal his mom's or his 
sister's clothes or something like that.

2996
02:16:17,150 --> 02:16:18,470
I heard,
I don't know my brain.

2997
02:16:18,950 --> 02:16:20,830
That makes sense.
That makes more sense.

2998
02:16:20,910 --> 02:16:22,440
Me,
I don't like these.

2999
02:16:22,690 --> 02:16:27,690
She's tortured and that must be awful.
I really like really feel comfortable 

3000
02:16:29,260 --> 02:16:30,310
like making.

3001
02:16:30,690 --> 02:16:35,690
I don't make fun of like her ed taylor 
or something like she's really a 

3002
02:16:35,690 --> 02:16:39,031
ridiculous person.
Like besides the forgetting the 

3003
02:16:39,031 --> 02:16:39,220
transgender thing,
like she's really funny.

3004
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:44,400
Well,
how about the fucking killed the lady 

3005
02:16:44,400 --> 02:16:44,400
and never bring it up.
Just that alone that yeah,

3006
02:16:44,400 --> 02:16:45,190
that is a.

3007
02:16:46,030 --> 02:16:48,100
I mean all of the conversations 
afterwards,

3008
02:16:48,101 --> 02:16:53,101
all the interviews afterwards,
it wasn't this existential crisis of 

3009
02:16:53,101 --> 02:16:56,641
having accidentally killed someone and 
being at this point in your life where 

3010
02:16:56,641 --> 02:16:56,641
you're like,
oh my god,

3011
02:16:56,641 --> 02:17:00,810
I don't have much time to live,
and I just sent some woman to her grave 

3012
02:17:00,810 --> 02:17:00,810
because I wasn't paying attention at the
wheel.

3013
02:17:00,810 --> 02:17:02,140
My escalate.
That never got brought up.

3014
02:17:02,190 --> 02:17:02,910
Yeah,
I don't.

3015
02:17:02,911 --> 02:17:05,280
I don't know like what she felt behind 
closed doors,

3016
02:17:05,281 --> 02:17:07,460
but it didn't seem like it slowed her 
down.

3017
02:17:08,850 --> 02:17:10,560
I think I'd take a month off and be 
like,

3018
02:17:10,590 --> 02:17:15,540
I got to like not be out in public and I
feel horrible and I'm going to take care

3019
02:17:15,541 --> 02:17:19,240
of this for a different eye.
Shades care.

3020
02:17:19,260 --> 02:17:24,260
She wants to even famous.
I didn't know how that cracked out and 

3021
02:17:24,260 --> 02:17:24,260
talk about that.

3022
02:17:27,800 --> 02:17:32,800
You're so good at that impression.
You could do her onstage and you don't 

3023
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:35,220
even need like the face swap,
like people would just start laughing

3024
02:17:35,990 --> 02:17:40,990
do and I did at largo.
I got fully dressed up and I put like 

3025
02:17:40,990 --> 02:17:44,170
glasses on it back and introduce you as 
caitlyn jenner.

3026
02:17:46,461 --> 02:17:46,840
Yeah,
yeah.

3027
02:17:46,850 --> 02:17:50,000
No,
I came out as like it was a big risk and

3028
02:17:50,270 --> 02:17:52,200
zach galifianakis is backstage.
I'm like,

3029
02:17:52,410 --> 02:17:54,110
I don't know what was going to go,
and he was like,

3030
02:17:54,111 --> 02:17:55,500
I've done.
I've dressed up as woman.

3031
02:17:55,501 --> 02:17:59,120
Then I'll just say this.
It's a longer fall when it fails,

3032
02:17:59,270 --> 02:18:04,270
which is true,
like if you get all dressed up and you 

3033
02:18:04,270 --> 02:18:04,270
bomb,
it's like

3034
02:18:05,150 --> 02:18:07,640
dark scared me.
Darkness,

3035
02:18:07,670 --> 02:18:12,670
darkness.
Lucky that she's ridiculous enough that 

3036
02:18:12,670 --> 02:18:17,531
you could point things out.
Like this is one of the things that 

3037
02:18:17,531 --> 02:18:20,241
people always say about you don't want.
When people were clamoring about what a 

3038
02:18:20,241 --> 02:18:20,241
great person hillary clinton was,
I'm like,

3039
02:18:20,330 --> 02:18:24,020
do you know that she didn't endorse gay 
marriage until 2013?

3040
02:18:24,320 --> 02:18:28,550
She was against know that against gay 
marriage until 2013.

3041
02:18:28,850 --> 02:18:33,850
She's a fucking ridiculous person.
There's hundreds of videos of her lying 

3042
02:18:34,010 --> 02:18:34,820
here.
What she said,

3043
02:18:34,821 --> 02:18:36,120
and you hear what the truth is right 
here.

3044
02:18:36,150 --> 02:18:40,040
Like the comey investigation with the 
fbi found that deleted emails.

3045
02:18:40,430 --> 02:18:41,680
Ben gazi,
she says,

3046
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:45,140
just not an honest person.
Maybe that's part of the job.

3047
02:18:45,290 --> 02:18:47,450
I don't know,
but that,

3048
02:18:47,480 --> 02:18:50,690
that if you bring that up to people,
they have less of an argument.

3049
02:18:50,691 --> 02:18:51,560
well,
with caitlin,

3050
02:18:51,640 --> 02:18:55,940
I'll bring up the fact that she's 
against gay marriage and people go,

3051
02:18:55,941 --> 02:18:56,810
wait,
what?

3052
02:18:57,110 --> 02:18:58,310
No.
Are you serious?

3053
02:18:58,490 --> 02:18:58,840
Like,
yeah,

3054
02:18:58,841 --> 02:18:59,290
yeah,
yeah.

3055
02:18:59,310 --> 02:19:01,100
Here I'm going to play something.
And then you play.

3056
02:19:01,101 --> 02:19:01,590
You're saying,
wow,

3057
02:19:01,591 --> 02:19:02,870
I'm but traditional girl.

3058
02:19:03,650 --> 02:19:06,630
Yeah.
It really is.

3059
02:19:06,631 --> 02:19:10,980
So mind blowing that it went over.
You almost can't.

3060
02:19:11,040 --> 02:19:14,040
I can't even wrap my head around.
That's got to be a joke.

3061
02:19:14,041 --> 02:19:14,660
I can't

3062
02:19:15,480 --> 02:19:17,940
can that much.
They seem to be like letting that slide,

3063
02:19:18,350 --> 02:19:21,880
but they don't see how fucking 
ridiculous that is.

3064
02:19:21,910 --> 02:19:24,160
Very hypocritical.
Just crazy.

3065
02:19:24,280 --> 02:19:29,030
it's crazy is what it is.
It's like mentally unstable.

3066
02:19:29,050 --> 02:19:32,240
There's,
there's bad processing going on,

3067
02:19:32,440 --> 02:19:35,800
abs.
I mean there's no sense or or empathy to

3068
02:19:35,980 --> 02:19:38,460
put that on this screen right there.
You.

3069
02:19:38,500 --> 02:19:39,070
It's crazy.

3070
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:39,780
First of all,
the.

3071
02:19:39,850 --> 02:19:44,020
The thing about gay marriage to me has 
always been who gives a fuck,

3072
02:19:44,050 --> 02:19:49,050
right?
Are we pretending that they don't love 

3073
02:19:49,050 --> 02:19:49,050
each other?
Like what are we doing?

3074
02:19:49,050 --> 02:19:49,360
Are we pretending that it's immoral?
Okay,

3075
02:19:49,361 --> 02:19:51,070
well,
it's a moral thing.

3076
02:19:51,310 --> 02:19:52,990
Then we have a real argument,
right,

3077
02:19:52,991 --> 02:19:57,991
like what is morality?
If it's not two people that love each 

3078
02:19:57,991 --> 02:20:00,721
other,
you have a problem with the fact that 

3079
02:20:00,721 --> 02:20:02,210
they're both boys.
They've done scientific studies that 

3080
02:20:02,210 --> 02:20:04,720
have shown that there's different.
They have a different pattern to the way

3081
02:20:04,721 --> 02:20:06,120
their brain thinks.
Yeah,

3082
02:20:06,220 --> 02:20:08,080
I mean they can show the difference in 
the way,

3083
02:20:08,081 --> 02:20:12,240
especially with trans kids and trans 
people there.

3084
02:20:12,310 --> 02:20:16,660
There are showing with mris and all 
these different ways of measuring,

3085
02:20:16,661 --> 02:20:21,661
like their brains appear to work more 
like a woman's brain and they do like a 

3086
02:20:21,661 --> 02:20:21,661
man's brain.
Like there's,

3087
02:20:21,661 --> 02:20:26,310
there's something going on.
It's not as simple as delusions and then

3088
02:20:26,311 --> 02:20:31,311
with gay people there's clearly 
something going on where they're 

3089
02:20:31,321 --> 02:20:36,321
attracted only to the same sex.
It's like a biological issue and this 

3090
02:20:36,331 --> 02:20:41,331
issue is it exists.
So to pretend that they're supposed to 

3091
02:20:41,331 --> 02:20:42,690
ignore that for your benefit.

3092
02:20:42,750 --> 02:20:43,740
Right.
Todd,

3093
02:20:43,770 --> 02:20:44,870
you know todd glass?
Sure.

3094
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:48,870
You brought up a great are insightful 
thing because he lived a lot.

3095
02:20:48,900 --> 02:20:53,900
People didn't know he was gay,
so he heard guys talking or people who 

3096
02:20:53,900 --> 02:20:57,081
are like homophobic or whatever and his 
point of view is like he thinks a lot of

3097
02:20:58,321 --> 02:21:01,830
the.
A lot of this is from people imagine the

3098
02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:06,920
act and they're grossed out.
It really bothers them and he was 

3099
02:21:06,920 --> 02:21:10,821
saying,
do you want to imagine your sister 

3100
02:21:10,821 --> 02:21:10,821
giving a blow job?
No,

3101
02:21:10,821 --> 02:21:15,080
it's disgusting,
but you want her to feel loved and you 

3102
02:21:15,080 --> 02:21:16,170
want her to have that happiness and 
that's all he was asking for.

3103
02:21:16,180 --> 02:21:18,240
I thought that was insightful thing.

3104
02:21:18,350 --> 02:21:22,460
I think a lot of times too,
it's just lack of exposure to gay people

3105
02:21:22,490 --> 02:21:24,950
when you're young in particular,
you know,

3106
02:21:25,890 --> 02:21:30,890
being or having them be accepted by your
family and other people and like what if

3107
02:21:31,581 --> 02:21:32,960
you were around?
When I was a kid,

3108
02:21:32,961 --> 02:21:35,510
I got really lucky.
I lived in san francisco from the time I

3109
02:21:35,511 --> 02:21:38,810
was seven to 11 and we were on a lot of 
gay people.

3110
02:21:38,811 --> 02:21:43,811
My next door neighborS were gay and they
would get naked with my aunt and it 

3111
02:21:43,811 --> 02:21:43,811
would play the bongos.
They would smoke pot,

3112
02:21:43,811 --> 02:21:46,850
play the bongos because it was san 
francisco or in the seventies.

3113
02:21:46,910 --> 02:21:50,600
Yeah,
so to me gay people were just like,

3114
02:21:50,660 --> 02:21:52,340
it was a normal thing.
It was just,

3115
02:21:52,440 --> 02:21:54,680
this guy is gay,
this guy is black,

3116
02:21:54,681 --> 02:21:57,320
this guy is old disco.
It's just a person.

3117
02:21:57,321 --> 02:21:59,570
Just different kind of person.
And then I moved to Florida.

3118
02:22:00,450 --> 02:22:02,450
Well when we were,
when I was 11,

3119
02:22:02,451 --> 02:22:04,240
we moved to Florida.
We moved to gains,

3120
02:22:04,250 --> 02:22:09,250
basically moved to a different country.
I moved to planet stupid and these 

3121
02:22:09,250 --> 02:22:11,200
people that I lived,
I had my friend,

3122
02:22:11,290 --> 02:22:16,290
his name was candy candido and he was a 
cuban kid and his dad was fucking super 

3123
02:22:17,351 --> 02:22:20,290
homophobic and so I remember I went over
his house,

3124
02:22:20,291 --> 02:22:22,480
wants after school to play and his dad 
was like,

3125
02:22:22,481 --> 02:22:25,300
I can't believe these fucking faggots 
want to get married,

3126
02:22:25,740 --> 02:22:26,000
believe

3127
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:31,010
this shit.
And he's throwing the newspaper down on 

3128
02:22:31,010 --> 02:22:31,010
a table.
And I remember I was,

3129
02:22:31,010 --> 02:22:32,070
I was 11.
I was like,

3130
02:22:32,071 --> 02:22:34,800
what's wrong with this fucking dummy?
Why does he care?

3131
02:22:35,070 --> 02:22:36,750
Like,
why is this bothering him at all?

3132
02:22:36,751 --> 02:22:39,000
It didn't even make sense to me.
Yeah.

3133
02:22:39,450 --> 02:22:44,400
There's a lot of people real rage 
underneath it all,

3134
02:22:44,401 --> 02:22:49,401
which I think they're scared of being 
gay and I don't want anybody to think 

3135
02:22:49,401 --> 02:22:49,401
they're gay.
They just,

3136
02:22:49,401 --> 02:22:52,590
it's just just putting it off and it may
be like the act.

3137
02:22:52,620 --> 02:22:55,890
Discuss them like the all sex is 
disgusting and the all of it.

3138
02:22:56,010 --> 02:22:57,450
You're doing it wrong.
Oh,

3139
02:22:57,451 --> 02:22:58,170
I am.
Yeah.

3140
02:22:58,171 --> 02:23:01,120
I'll talk to you after the show after 
show and give me some pointers.

3141
02:23:01,140 --> 02:23:06,140
Something was.
Maybe that's why you haven't had a kid 

3142
02:23:06,140 --> 02:23:06,180
yet.
Thirty years.

3143
02:23:06,181 --> 02:23:09,150
I've been trying put it in the bud like 
you're supposed to.

3144
02:23:10,120 --> 02:23:12,780
No,
no,

3145
02:23:13,710 --> 02:23:14,670
don't do that.

3146
02:23:15,060 --> 02:23:17,790
How long have we been talking about?
I feel like I've been talking two hours.

3147
02:23:18,510 --> 02:23:20,580
Forty minutes.
Somewhere around there.

3148
02:23:21,010 --> 02:23:22,650
We're going to wrap it up.
I'm a gabber huh?

3149
02:23:22,770 --> 02:23:23,580
No,
we always do this.

3150
02:23:23,730 --> 02:23:25,590
Oh wait,
what is a normal length of a show?

3151
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:27,000
Probably around that.
Really?

3152
02:23:27,020 --> 02:23:28,800
Yeah.
You do this twice a week.

3153
02:23:29,140 --> 02:23:30,210
Uh,
this week.

3154
02:23:30,211 --> 02:23:31,620
Four times.
Wow.

3155
02:23:31,760 --> 02:23:33,670
Your banking,
if you know,

3156
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:37,350
put their go live.
We're streaming live and then afterwards

3157
02:23:37,351 --> 02:23:40,740
we'll put it up on itunes and it'll 
upload to youtube and a little bit.

3158
02:23:41,420 --> 02:23:42,750
You got a whole thing going.
Yeah,

3159
02:23:43,410 --> 02:23:48,410
but I have too many guests requests.
It's like there's almost too many and I 

3160
02:23:48,781 --> 02:23:51,480
love doing it.
So just do a bunch of them.

3161
02:23:51,481 --> 02:23:52,960
Who's your favorite guests?
Don't.

3162
02:23:53,680 --> 02:23:56,040
Besides countdown.
Second cows on it again.

3163
02:23:56,170 --> 02:23:58,320
Oh wow.
This is great.

3164
02:23:59,910 --> 02:24:02,850
I don't have one.
I'm so lucky.

3165
02:24:02,910 --> 02:24:04,170
I've had so many great guests.

3166
02:24:04,170 --> 02:24:05,370
I really don't have a favorite.
Yeah,

3167
02:24:05,371 --> 02:24:06,670
you do.
Yeah.

3168
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:12,260
Yeah.
I just never had sam harris through 

3169
02:24:12,260 --> 02:24:15,580
pretty good gash.
And your impression has replaced her 

3170
02:24:15,580 --> 02:24:20,211
real voice in my mind if I see her on tv
and why should I got my shy shopping 

3171
02:24:23,370 --> 02:24:24,800
chain trauma challenge?
Yeah.

3172
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:31,640
Yeah.
I'm not sure what she sounds like 

3173
02:24:31,640 --> 02:24:31,640
anymore.
It might be different.

3174
02:24:31,640 --> 02:24:31,640
So,
um,

3175
02:24:31,640 --> 02:24:34,370
do you have mapped out future ones that 
you're working on right now?

3176
02:24:34,380 --> 02:24:39,380
I have a couple.
I actually have like a song I just 

3177
02:24:39,380 --> 02:24:41,930
recorded.
I couldn't play the second because I 

3178
02:24:41,930 --> 02:24:42,270
heard that she hits from the ladies 
tees.

3179
02:24:42,950 --> 02:24:44,050
No,
I don't.

3180
02:24:44,060 --> 02:24:47,220
I don't even want to research it because
I don't want it to not be true,

3181
02:24:47,400 --> 02:24:49,860
but that's what I heard.
So I wrote a song about her hitting from

3182
02:24:49,861 --> 02:24:54,861
the ladies tees.
Do you have a internet with my phone is 

3183
02:24:54,861 --> 02:24:55,530
broken.
I need to internet to like a,

3184
02:24:55,680 --> 02:24:58,030
like a dual world premier right now.
Okay.

3185
02:24:58,370 --> 02:25:01,110
Like a jamie can look something up.
Well no,

3186
02:25:01,111 --> 02:25:03,510
it's in my email.
Oh,

3187
02:25:03,511 --> 02:25:08,190
you need our wifi password here.
Give it to jamie will type it in there.

3188
02:25:08,570 --> 02:25:10,530
Yeah.
What's your phones?

3189
02:25:10,531 --> 02:25:12,960
Just it died it.
But it's working.

3190
02:25:13,020 --> 02:25:14,000
No,
it,

3191
02:25:14,001 --> 02:25:18,810
it doesn't do phone calls.
I got wifi but that's it.

3192
02:25:18,840 --> 02:25:23,840
And it dies sometimes for no reason.
I went to the 18 to two store before 

3193
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:23,840
this.
I've got to go to the apple store.

3194
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:24,220
That's a major

3195
02:25:24,220 --> 02:25:25,390
problem.
This isn't interesting.

3196
02:25:25,391 --> 02:25:27,490
But anyway,
power cord next to you too.

3197
02:25:27,820 --> 02:25:31,850
I had my phone break.
My phone broken Hawaii because I was aI.

3198
02:25:32,680 --> 02:25:37,680
just dropped it too many times.
It started making random phone calls so 

3199
02:25:37,680 --> 02:25:37,680
I could open the contact screen and 
start calling people.

3200
02:25:37,870 --> 02:25:39,490
Hang up.
Tara cost somebody else.

3201
02:25:39,491 --> 02:25:40,720
I would hang up.
Well,

3202
02:25:42,170 --> 02:25:44,090
lucky's,
no one in my contacts I don't like,

3203
02:25:44,091 --> 02:25:48,720
but um,
when it did that I had to it and then it

3204
02:25:48,721 --> 02:25:52,770
totally stopped where it wouldn't let me
punch in my code to unlock it.

3205
02:25:52,771 --> 02:25:55,170
It was just fucked.
Wouldn't recognize my face.

3206
02:25:55,171 --> 02:25:56,070
It was like,
fuck you.

3207
02:25:56,250 --> 02:25:57,120
It was,
it was dead.

3208
02:25:57,850 --> 02:26:02,850
Um,
so I ordered one and I had to get it 

3209
02:26:02,850 --> 02:26:03,120
shipped and I was in lanai,
which is a really small island,

3210
02:26:03,121 --> 02:26:05,460
so it takes a few days to get an iphone 
there.

3211
02:26:05,461 --> 02:26:08,900
It took three days,
but was beautiful.

3212
02:26:08,900 --> 02:26:13,900
Three days.
Best three days of your life days with 

3213
02:26:13,900 --> 02:26:14,390
no phone chillen yesterday.
I could not.

3214
02:26:14,690 --> 02:26:19,690
So funny.
There's a article I just found where he 

3215
02:26:19,690 --> 02:26:19,690
or she.
I'm sorry,

3216
02:26:19,690 --> 02:26:23,831
she was talking about let's vote on it.
She said,

3217
02:26:24,740 --> 02:26:25,490
craig,
t nelson,

3218
02:26:25,491 --> 02:26:30,491
his comment,
I played golf with you for 30 years 

3219
02:26:30,491 --> 02:26:30,491
before caitlyn.
Nelson said,

3220
02:26:30,491 --> 02:26:32,780
I know how you hit.
So it wasn't prejudice.

3221
02:26:32,900 --> 02:26:35,230
He said he wouldn't allow her.
He wouldn't allow her to hit from the.

3222
02:26:35,660 --> 02:26:39,650
I think if you're on a wheaties box,
you can't as easily as an athlete.

3223
02:26:39,651 --> 02:26:44,651
You can't remember her part.
Jenner said she'd hit from either box 

3224
02:26:44,651 --> 02:26:47,470
depending on how the group voted and 
women's t one.

3225
02:26:47,650 --> 02:26:48,700
Oh,
and don't worry.

3226
02:26:48,701 --> 02:26:52,150
She dominated everyone on the links.
Both sexes.

3227
02:26:52,900 --> 02:26:53,980
Sure.
She's a pro.

3228
02:26:54,040 --> 02:26:56,440
She's a fucking olympic gold medalist.
I know.

3229
02:26:56,500 --> 02:26:58,360
Even though she's 70 years old and a 
woman.

3230
02:26:58,361 --> 02:27:00,730
Well she.
She went through puberty as a Michigan.

3231
02:27:00,760 --> 02:27:04,630
The men muscles in the main skeleton.
It's all withered away.

3232
02:27:05,230 --> 02:27:07,120
Well,
here's some skeletons still there,

3233
02:27:07,121 --> 02:27:10,360
but the muscles are gone.
This is the world premier.

3234
02:27:10,420 --> 02:27:11,980
I will put the whole thing.
Play a baby.

3235
02:27:12,710 --> 02:27:13,510
Well,
I just put on this.

3236
02:27:13,610 --> 02:27:18,610
Yeah.
I'm going to shoot the video,

3237
02:27:33,710 --> 02:27:36,530
I'm sure.

3238
02:28:00,460 --> 02:28:02,830
What is the lady see closer?
I don't play golf.

3239
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:04,650
Twenty,
30 yards closer.

3240
02:28:07,500 --> 02:28:08,670
Driving the card.

3241
02:28:12,050 --> 02:28:14,230
Let's end with that.
Carl dunnigan.

3242
02:28:14,231 --> 02:28:15,090
You're funny,
motherfucker,

3243
02:28:15,100 --> 02:28:20,100
man.
I'm glad you listened to that terrible 

3244
02:28:20,100 --> 02:28:20,200
feeling that you had in the middle of 
the night.

3245
02:28:20,530 --> 02:28:21,270
I am.
Really?

3246
02:28:21,560 --> 02:28:22,280
I'm really glad

3247
02:28:22,460 --> 02:28:23,750
you got more songs playing.
