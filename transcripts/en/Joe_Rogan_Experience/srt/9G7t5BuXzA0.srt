1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,200
Ever done ends on the show ends.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,333
Oh No.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,090
What is it?

4
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:05,560
No thanks.

5
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,550
So wait a minute.

6
00:00:06,551 --> 00:00:07,131
So either this,

7
00:00:07,131 --> 00:00:08,200
let's try that real quick.

8
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,300
Do one on one.

9
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,353
Um,

10
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,143
your mother

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:41,933
HD

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,930
now is when table cause this
rant of paint companies dance

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,530
is feeling Castro

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,210
don't even feel the effects when he
says cam and it signs it being blessed.

15
00:00:59,681 --> 00:01:01,140
So miles off track,

16
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,310
it's not smoking crack.

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,351
And once it,

18
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:07,180
his brain starts and chain
me yet shared office bags,

19
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:08,220
shoes I was feeling,

20
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,150
he says,

21
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,150
announce team now is out in the stream
and he lacked Jesse James [inaudible] but

22
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,750
even been in school.

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,210
It's nervous with it to
bounce back in blood in Poo

24
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,650
wrap their mother

25
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,210
rats they snatched

26
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,753
kids get

27
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,710
we go

28
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,763
and

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,833
swinging

30
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,023
the men's.

31
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,040
They're wrapped the flag.

32
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,770
Random wearing a sham p Jews out
of near glass stash and no savings.

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,360
She knew the bandits.

34
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,180
Shopping sprees get

35
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,723
keys.

36
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,890
You magnify.

37
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,340
Come on one day.

38
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:25,780
If I can match him,

39
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:29,380
I have wetlands out the
battle of the books.

40
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,970
She's been the rich.

41
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,830
Some people was rammed him.

42
00:02:36,831 --> 00:02:37,664
Mother

43
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,120
rats.

44
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,953
These snaps

45
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,953
so

46
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:53,700
far.

47
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,530
We go and

48
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,120
DMC,

49
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,953
they will

50
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,460
go nasty.

51
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,290
Lagging.

52
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,850
Matt Simpson pushing for her influence.

53
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,060
One disappeared.

54
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,953
Him

55
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:55,661
Rats,

56
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:59,230
these snapshot fall and

57
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,111
Sam,

58
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:05,210
Sam his game and

59
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,400
well faraway ago and him

60
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:22,841
rats.

61
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:23,674
They're snatched

62
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,060
Sam.

63
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,040
Sam's kids.

64
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:32,883
Good.

65
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,550
I am

66
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,363
glorious.

67
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,560
Absolutely glorious.

68
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:47,701
Yeah.

69
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:49,470
I never heard that acoustic version four.

70
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,370
I don't think I pulled it out a lot
cause that mid section where I go there,

71
00:04:52,371 --> 00:04:55,620
I feel like it just loses something
when I go to the bridge without like an

72
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:56,040
accompany.

73
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,221
Yes,

74
00:04:56,221 --> 00:04:57,480
but his sounded all right right there.
