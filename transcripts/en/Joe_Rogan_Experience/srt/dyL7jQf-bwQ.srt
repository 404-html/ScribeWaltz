1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,500
The joe rogan experience when I started
doing nights or doing yoga when I travel

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:05,940
and I feel better,

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,170
I feel a lot better doing that.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,330
That's because all the girls
that yoga pants in the class,

5
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:10,320
it makes you feel better too.

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:10,861
Is that what it,

7
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:11,760
is she excited?

8
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,860
Maybe I'm misunderstanding
the whole thing.

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,333
No Yoga.

10
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,420
That was the pig.

11
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,920
I could just go to the yoga pants.

12
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:20,370
Sure.

13
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:20,701
Yeah.

14
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:22,380
You can just go to a strip
club and you feel great.

15
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:22,781
Well,

16
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:25,590
I started going to strip clubs on
the road and I just a I really,

17
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,473
it really picked me,

18
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,840
I'm sure I wrote down
in a strip club name.

19
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,710
I played Largo the other night and
there's a place across from it.

20
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,500
I don't know what it's
called in the phone book,

21
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,100
but the name on the outside of the door
is star strip is all the same font and

22
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:46,863
font size.

23
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,240
Star Strip.

24
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,510
Totally nude live nude girls,

25
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:51,811
girls,

26
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:52,644
girls.

27
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,060
The stars chip on La Cienega.

28
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:54,750
Yeah.

29
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,081
Yeah.

30
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:55,381
Dude,

31
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:55,601
I,

32
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:57,450
I had a bit about that it true story.

33
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,620
Um,

34
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,380
where the girl was dancing and I said,

35
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:01,890
hey,

36
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:02,341
do you,

37
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:03,360
do you like doing this?

38
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,170
She goes,

39
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,520
I don't talk to guys who come here.

40
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,720
And I said,

41
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:06,931
well,

42
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:07,381
why?

43
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:08,580
I mean it's an open door.

44
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,530
I mean like nice people
can come through too.

45
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,551
And she goes,

46
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:12,030
well,

47
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,170
most guys who come here,

48
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,550
they only come here for one reason.

49
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:14,820
I mean,

50
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,750
why did you come here?

51
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,790
Like she was like shutting me down.

52
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,571
And I said,

53
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:21,450
cause someone told me there was a place
that I could do go where I could see a

54
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:23,940
strange girl's pussy for a dollar.

55
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,483
Okay.

56
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,343
And that was the joke.

57
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,520
Like I'm the asshole.

58
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,940
I only did it show up where you work.

59
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:33,240
All right,

60
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,130
I'm a bad person because he worked here,

61
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,513
you know,

62
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,550
different people go to different places,

63
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,560
different reasons to go
to strip clubs a lot.

64
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:40,891
And you know,

65
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:41,724
it turned me off.

66
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,290
I was in Nashville once,

67
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,720
I saw a commercial on TV for a strip club.

68
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:46,470
And I was like,

69
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,010
I would like,

70
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:47,791
that seems fun.

71
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:48,624
I'll go there.

72
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,411
And,

73
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:50,070
uh,

74
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,900
and they went and then I gave the guy
my id when I walked in and he goes,

75
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,820
Hey Mike Birbiglia I like your comedy.

76
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:00,481
And I was just like,

77
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:01,980
I'm never going to a strip called forget.

78
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:02,814
I've never got back.

79
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,181
Why?

80
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:04,260
Because they don't want you to know.

81
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,670
You're like the anonymity of it.

82
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:06,504
I don't want to be,

83
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,040
I don't want anyone to watch
me watch someone be nay.

84
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:11,341
I just,

85
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:11,880
I'm not,

86
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,780
I can't handle that.

87
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,020
You need a wig in a fake mustache id.

88
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,600
A wig or a fake mustache.

89
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,810
I can you one.

90
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:19,591
We're in Hollywood.

91
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:20,760
There's plenty of stores.

92
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,510
Yeah.

93
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,990
I,

94
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,890
that's why I'm here.

95
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,340
I sorry it took so long
for me to get to the point,

96
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,600
but uh,

97
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,051
yeah.

98
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:29,780
Do you have like a cost to microwave?

99
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,380
Cause I really want to go.

100
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,420
The California thing is whenever,

101
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:38,730
you know someone's come from California
because in the first 30 seconds they

102
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:40,680
tell you something incredibly intimate,

103
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,820
intimate about their life.

104
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:42,000
Like,

105
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,330
Oh yes,

106
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,120
I used to be addicted to drugs or
like I was molested and I'm like,

107
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,030
that's why they're here.

108
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,400
Dog burdened me with this shit.

109
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,260
I don't want to know that.

110
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:48,960
It's sad,

111
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,800
but that's why they're here.

112
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:50,950
Yeah.

113
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,490
You know it's weird
because this is also the,

114
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,250
obviously people create
all over the world,

115
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,210
no doubt about that.

116
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,700
But when you come to like creating
things that get attention,

117
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,840
this is like the pub of the universe
creating things that get attention.

118
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,220
It's almost all in Hollywood.

119
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,210
It's like a big chunk of it,

120
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:07,931
whether it's movies,

121
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:08,764
TV shows,

122
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,101
blah,

123
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:09,341
blah,

124
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:09,581
blah,

125
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:10,270
blah.

126
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,230
Who needs attention?

127
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,470
People that didn't get enough or people
that got too much of the wrong con and

128
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:16,690
those are the ones that seek
out and seek out validation.

129
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:17,511
So they all come here.

130
00:03:17,511 --> 00:03:18,070
It's so weird.

131
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,090
Mathematical process.

132
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:19,420
Oh,

133
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,330
he's loved Angelina.

134
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,930
I believe he always left her.

135
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,020
Now the whole blonde bombshell just put
fucking billboards of herself and came

136
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:26,040
famous just for that.

137
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,030
I saw her the other day just picking her
nose and eating it and then you posted

138
00:03:30,031 --> 00:03:30,421
something about,

139
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:33,330
you saw somebody picking your nose and
eating it like the day after and I'm

140
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:33,481
like,

141
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:34,170
what the fuck?

142
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,040
That's hilarious.

143
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,930
I love that pink corvette around

144
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,540
a wig.

145
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,130
She was a on the PCH,

146
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,970
the Topanga to the pcs on the merge were
stopped at the light and I look behind

147
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,880
and I watched this old
lady in a wig just dig,

148
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,751
pull out,

149
00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:50,150
I'll whopper and just start chewing.

150
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:50,391
I mean,

151
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:53,580
she was openly chill
enough mouth open chewing,

152
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:54,110
and I was like,

153
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,943
wow.

154
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,270
And all I could think of,

155
00:03:56,271 --> 00:03:59,900
of course for the rest of the day it
was that she probably came over here in

156
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:04,901
1955 and she wanted to be a star and
she was hot and it just didn't work out.

157
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:10,190
And now she's wearing a wig on the PCH
chewing or burgers in her blue Saturn

158
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:11,690
with fucking faded out paint.

159
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,360
It was a very weird watch
as I thought it was.

160
00:04:14,361 --> 00:04:15,470
I thought she always drove a vet.

161
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,530
Now that's Angelina [inaudible].

162
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:17,901
Angelina,

163
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:21,050
I saw some random crazy
lady was light blue Saturn.

164
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,041
I do that with people.

165
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,110
I like try to piece together
what their story was,

166
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:24,310
what's,

167
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,590
what's it?

168
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,380
That fucking mind always goes
down to drugs and blow jobs.

169
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,080
The story's all there.

170
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,960
Very unoriginal.

171
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,251
They always,

172
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:31,491
you know,

173
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:33,770
somewhere along the line
someone blew Burt Reynolds.

174
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,120
That's always in my stories.

175
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,730
So Jordan would show up at a place in
2000 women would show up to meet him

176
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:41,564
there.

177
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,670
7,000 women would get the text message,

178
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,240
Michael Jr.

179
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,721
Oh my God.

180
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:46,700
Imagine the pussy that has
been thrown at Michael Jordan.

181
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,983
It's not even,

182
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,490
you can't even wrap your head around.

183
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:49,700
You know,

184
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,210
it's like,

185
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,320
it's like locusts

186
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,410
step outside.

187
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:55,690
Oh

188
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,523
yeah.

189
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,620
He's as multiple suits now
for people that are like this,

190
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,483
this is your kid.

191
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,940
And he's actually won
suits and he keeps winning.

192
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:05,110
I'm winning them cause there's,

193
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,260
that's how you know he's so famous.

194
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,760
I think there's probably people
that did feel like you did fuck me.

195
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:09,970
He's like,

196
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:10,900
I didn't make a kid with you.

197
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:10,991
Well,

198
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:11,890
this is also probably,

199
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:12,520
I'm sure,

200
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,210
but there's also probably people that are
like hoping that he'll just pay him x.

201
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:16,721
Of course.

202
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:17,530
Just shut up.

203
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,363
Here's some,

204
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,990
here's the 300 grand of shut up.

205
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,740
Yeah.

206
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,870
But you can't just keep doing that.

207
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,570
No.

208
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,220
Especially when you're
not making money anymore.

209
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:24,431
I mean,

210
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:25,960
how much those Hanes commercials pay?

211
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,141
Oh,

212
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:29,290
he makes unbelievable
money still doing what?

213
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,280
Well,

214
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,100
his shoe brand is the absolute crazy.

215
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:33,380
Oh,

216
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,213
that's his,

217
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,220
that's his journey.

218
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,040
His Nike owns his brand of Air Jordan,

219
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,380
but he is a huge,

220
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,410
huge benefactor of that brand
and he is the number one chew,

221
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:49,991
uh,

222
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:50,860
among like that,

223
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,130
you know,

224
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,570
basketball shoes are a huge,

225
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:54,400
huge multibillion dollar business.

226
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:54,880
Yeah.

227
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,680
His shoes still outsell
the Bron and Kolby,

228
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:58,790
which is,

229
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,380
and he's been done for years.

230
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,340
That's so crazy.

231
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:01,881
Yeah.

232
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:06,881
I would say that Michael Jordan's still
probably makes him probably like $40

233
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:08,810
million a year.

234
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,940
God to Aina.

235
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,620
Yeah.

236
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:10,951
He's,

237
00:06:10,951 --> 00:06:11,510
he's,

238
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,800
as far as business goes,

239
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,731
he has set up,

240
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:14,240
man.

241
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,680
That's unbelievable.

242
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,090
Wow.

243
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,301
Yeah.

244
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:18,650
I didn't even think about the sneakers,

245
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,131
but it's,

246
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:19,201
it,

247
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:24,201
it is incredible when you hear about a
guy who was so awesome that still to this

248
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:25,191
day,

249
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:25,761
it's amazing.

250
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,830
His name rings in the hallowed halls.

251
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:28,640
They do that.

252
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,031
Oh look,

253
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:29,421
I'm sorry,

254
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:30,650
that was off by 40 million.

255
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,973
God,

256
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,420
yes.

257
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,060
But how many athletes can say that?

258
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:35,923
None.

259
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:36,351
None.

260
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:37,380
He's number one edible.

261
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,021
They do that.

262
00:06:38,021 --> 00:06:38,390
That,

263
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:43,160
I think it's like a Q rating where they
rank the impact of just athletes and the

264
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:46,250
top 10 is like always the
craziest list of guys who you all,

265
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:47,630
we all know who they are at tiger woods,

266
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,440
right.

267
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,080
I mean Michael Jordan is number one.

268
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,970
He's been number one for like 25
years and the lowest he ever dipped,

269
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,090
he went to like number two
once under tiger woods.

270
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,531
Pissed.

271
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:01,220
Very pissed.

272
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:01,911
I bet he was.

273
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:02,290
Yeah.

274
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:02,900
Yeah.

275
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,450
Thing is that he is a notorious gambler.

276
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,970
He's actually a really good golf golfer.

277
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:09,950
Like he has like a real game,

278
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:10,670
you know.

279
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,870
And he would bet wouldn't,

280
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,070
it wasn't uncommon for him to bet a
quarter million on a round of golf.

281
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,110
And he would also,

282
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,453
uh,

283
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,031
they said like,

284
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:21,140
when he goes to Vegas,

285
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,370
he does,

286
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:22,850
you know,

287
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,910
Shit like that for fun because
he makes 80 million a year.

288
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,020
It's incredible.

289
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,090
What a weird life that guy has.

290
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:29,331
Yeah,

291
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:29,930
it's amazing.

292
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,160
And he's getting married.

293
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,240
He got married.

294
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,870
He got married.

295
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,230
Yeah.

296
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,310
Something Young Hottie too.

297
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,210
She's so hot.

298
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,820
Ooh.

299
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,440
Well Cuban,

300
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,060
I think she's a half Cuban or a Cuban.

301
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,081
Just like fuck it.

302
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:40,160
I'll just give her a little piece.

303
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:40,790
Yeah,

304
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,050
give a little piece of this cash.

305
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,621
You think that's,

306
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:43,130
um,

307
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,880
pretty airtight prenup you'd get
when you married Michael Jordan.

308
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:47,920
Oh,

309
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:52,910
I imagining it goes through several
layers of lawyers looking for,

310
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:53,240
anyway,

311
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,500
your lawyer sends it back.

312
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:54,801
They're like,

313
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:55,350
listen.

314
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,730
Yeah.

315
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,500
Do you like him?

316
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,333
Do you want this to work?

317
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,640
There's no other lawyer this.

318
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,460
Just sign it.

319
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,450
You can't negotiate.

320
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,790
You get 23 and you for life.

321
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,540
That's a good deal.

322
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:05,900
Right?

323
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,910
And he's just a maniac gambler.

324
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:10,910
Just gone off with an 80 million
a year coming in every year.

325
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:13,130
And that's why you can't say
shit about what was gambling?

326
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,990
I lost $1 million gambling today.

327
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,170
10 years plus he's making like a hundred.

328
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,070
You mean,

329
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,820
think about that.

330
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,690
It's so crazy.

331
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:23,450
$100 million a year
close to it for 10 years.

332
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:23,750
I mean,

333
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,590
how long does it take?

334
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,551
Does he have a billion?

335
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:26,384
Do you think it has a billion?

336
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,170
A billion?

337
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:27,460
Yeah.

338
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,040
Yeah.

339
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,191
I mean,

340
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:29,690
if you make an 80 million a year,

341
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,550
and he was famous for,

342
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,850
I don't know if it was him
or his agent at the time,

343
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:38,450
but he's famous for being
one of the innovators in the,

344
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,130
when he was getting these crazy,

345
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,120
um,

346
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,170
endorsement deals,

347
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,320
he was getting stock as part of his deal.

348
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:46,154
So like,

349
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,040
he would get millions
of dollars to sponsor,

350
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,251
you know,

351
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:50,720
to be the endorser of Gatorade,

352
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,120
but then insisted on owning stock.

353
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,750
Well,

354
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,321
guess what?

355
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:56,400
When Michael Jordan
started endorsing Gatorade,

356
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,610
stock went up pretty significantly,

357
00:08:59,611 --> 00:09:00,930
and he made many,

358
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,880
many more millions than he would have.

359
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,280
So he's pretty innovative
in that sense too.
