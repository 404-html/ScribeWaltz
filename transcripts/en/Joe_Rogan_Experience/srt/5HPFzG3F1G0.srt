1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,110
You know,

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,960
this is going to come a point in time
where human beings have like a biological

4
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:09,900
meeting and we decide now that
we have genetic engineering,

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,540
should we decide to
continue with this shape?

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,240
Should we decide to
continue with this shape?

7
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:16,074
What is love?

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,790
What is beauty in the eye of the beholder?

9
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,060
Could we all be better off
if we're flying jellyfish,

10
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:28,080
they'd come up with this proposition
to be able to replace a with a simple

11
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:28,914
prescription,

12
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:29,670
uh,

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,670
any feelings of love or sex or
affection that people need or want,

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,180
it's all satiated.

15
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:36,341
You,

16
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:41,070
you never have to worry about reclaiming
that again and that the most harmonious

17
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:42,570
shape for the universe,

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,220
the most harmonious shape
to coexist forever with a,

19
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,160
an infinite lifespan is flying jellyfish.

20
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,470
How long before we'd be all be
flying jellyfish seven years.

21
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,940
The way that thing just flew,

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,990
I want it to be that thing.

23
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,740
I know it's threw it off a bridge,

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,050
which someone gets really just throw
you off a bridge and you just show this.

25
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:05,893
And this is the,

26
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,560
imagine that technology in 20 years where
that thing is following you around all

27
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:11,190
day long,

28
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,023
all night long.

29
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,270
Imagine that in the shape of Dicks,

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,660
imagine once they figure out to the
shape of a dick is really not perfect.

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:18,901
You know?

32
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:21,630
And just like there's other shit that's
wrong with people like the fact that so

33
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:22,710
easy to knock us out.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,833
Yeah,

35
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,260
that's a big flaw.

36
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,311
Punched him in the chin.

37
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:28,020
They go unconscious as a stupid flaw.

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,210
What if they realize like
dicks are good but have a seat.

39
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,163
I'm going to show you the new,

40
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,060
we're going to show you the next level,

41
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,501
the next level,

42
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:38,580
some sort of new thing.

43
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,220
It gets inside you and just expands,

44
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,130
expands like a fist.

45
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,820
So in a few little dicks
all around at Tube,

46
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,200
like the main Dick tube and
it's spreads out like corn.

47
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,510
And I want to talk a little decks inside.

48
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:58,830
I think.

49
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,240
Imagine if your Dick was,

50
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,393
uh,

51
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,090
this might be the dumbest
thing I've ever said.

52
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,780
Imagine if your Dick was like an ear
of corn and each one of those little

53
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,460
kernels was another dick.

54
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,100
And once your Dick got in
there and we had dick was hard,

55
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:11,851
you dick got in there,

56
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:14,870
then all those little dicks would
pop out and we would all like,

57
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,790
they would all play music
inside the girl's Vagina,

58
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,320
not downtown,

59
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,950
downtown dumped.

60
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,010
Um,

61
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,510
and that would be the thing,

62
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,400
like girls could come the hardest.

63
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:29,160
You've made the best
music inside the vagina.

64
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,181
Oh,

65
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:30,690
Joe.

66
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,523
That's what I'm saying.

67
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,723
Right.

68
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:33,841
Listen,

69
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:35,730
that's a very important point.

70
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,870
If you just assuming that the Dick shape
that we have currently is the best,

71
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,260
but if you got the dick shape we had
currently and the ability to make music

72
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:44,094
with your deck,

73
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,993
right,

74
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:45,960
Jamie.

75
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,201
Jamie,

76
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:47,320
don't look at me like crazy.

77
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,960
Trying to think what kind
of music you mentioned Donk,

78
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:50,260
Donk,

79
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,093
Donk,

80
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:56,070
some Beethoven Shit said a piano
or a violin or mostly like drums,

81
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:56,700
I guess.

82
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,090
Okay.

83
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,650
Depends on what you're
trying to accomplish.

84
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,441
Yeah.

85
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:01,060
I'm more of like a a you,

86
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:02,890
a Bongo player or bass drum.

87
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,080
I could see Jamie playing pong.

88
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:06,700
Guys had a flirty play,

89
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:10,420
a gym day that was one of the
most intense title fights ever.

90
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:13,900
Roy McDonald got you mean they got,

91
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,610
he got so close to winning that title.

92
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:17,350
He had Robbie Lawler almost knocked out.

93
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:18,610
He head kicked him Dang dumb.

94
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:22,300
Robbie was wombling and then Robbie came
back to stop them in the next round and

95
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,380
his nose exploded and he literally
went down in pain and you could see him

96
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,380
writhing on the floor and it looked
like he was just trying to find some

97
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:32,980
comfort.

98
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,000
Like the pain was so intense when that
broken knows that he was just trying to

99
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:39,010
find some kind of comfort.

100
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,080
Blood was everywhere and it was just two
guys that push themselves to the brink.

101
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,510
And unfortunately when you see a fight,

102
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,200
what does that,

103
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,160
can you go to the bathroom?

104
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,000
So what you're saying,

105
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,833
just ask,

106
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:50,501
go ahead.

107
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:51,111
Go to the bathroom.

108
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:51,944
Jesus Christ.

109
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,313
Dad,

110
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,110
guys drinking over here.

111
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,110
Chris Palm Coast,

112
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,060
the only one drinking here,

113
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,770
throwing down the booze,

114
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,810
checking his fucking
Twitter every five minutes.

115
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,100
But uh,

116
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,820
the,

117
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,240
it was,

118
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,600
it was a sport or it was a fight rather
with these like you see them here like

119
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,130
writhing in agony like here,

120
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,800
like that is so hard to deal with.

121
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:13,071
I mean,

122
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:13,851
he's just looking at him,

123
00:04:13,851 --> 00:04:14,240
he's like,

124
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,073
oh,

125
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,640
he just goes down.

126
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:16,971
I mean,

127
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:19,370
he's just in agony.

128
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,790
I mean it's one of the most tense moments

129
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,460
I've ever seen in a fight of just like
the most obvious expression of it,

130
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,391
of pain.

131
00:04:29,391 --> 00:04:29,571
I mean,

132
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:30,404
look at them here.

133
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,333
It's crazy.

134
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,340
He might not ever be the same.

135
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:34,770
Yeah.

136
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,181
Neat.

137
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:36,050
When by the way,

138
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:37,700
are Robbie too.

139
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,650
That was a crazy fucking fight.

140
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,300
Rory said the next day.

141
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:42,890
That was the greatest day of his life.

142
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,250
Yeah,

143
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,580
I'm sure that's what kind of,

144
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:44,720
uh,

145
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,200
that's the,

146
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,190
that's the man he is.

147
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,061
I mean,

148
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:49,070
he fought his heart out.

149
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,990
There was nothing left for vault of them.

150
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,910
They were so closely matched,

151
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,200
such a good fight.

152
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,180
And in Robbie,

153
00:04:56,181 --> 00:05:01,181
how about when he's screaming in victory
and his lip is split open like a cleft

154
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:06,740
palate has Lyft has split open
this giant Gash in his lip.

155
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:07,550
Like look at them.

156
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,550
There's a sideways photo where you see
like a profile picture of him roaring

157
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,880
with his lip split open and it's
this hard to believe that this guy's,

158
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,170
you know,

159
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,490
that he fought like that.

160
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,060
He fought with his lip split wide.

161
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:21,101
Oh,

162
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:22,090
if there's a better picture of it,

163
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:23,030
Jamie for find it.

164
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,920
It's like a sideways angle of the
side where you see the actual uh,

165
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,611
cut itself.

166
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:31,820
But it was one of the most gruesome
lip injuries I've ever seen.

167
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:32,221
And you know,

168
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:33,800
it was the guy who won that,

169
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,790
those guys,

170
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,020
there is where it is.

171
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,220
Dana Dana apparently walked up from
that side right there and said,

172
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:40,761
oh my God,

173
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:41,594
don't talk.

174
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,143
Say Man.

175
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,070
Yeah.

176
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,800
I mean his lip was literally
just a giant slice.

177
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,050
Like you get hit with
a hatchet in the face.

178
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:51,651
It was crazy.

179
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:52,281
It was a crazy,

180
00:05:52,281 --> 00:05:52,611
crazy,

181
00:05:52,611 --> 00:05:53,444
crazy fight.

182
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,770
And one of the most intense closely
match title fights in the Welterweight

183
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,430
Division is history.

184
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:58,670
Yeah.

185
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,151
I ever,

186
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:00,800
it was about down to the wire,

187
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,380
I met a woman at one of
my shows in Brooklyn.

188
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,170
She had no hands or feet.

189
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,213
What happened to her?

190
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:10,790
Well,

191
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:15,290
she came up to me after the show and
she like wanted to like give me a hug.

192
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:15,561
She was like,

193
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:16,490
you're so funny.

194
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,680
And she had like these
stuffs and she said,

195
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,980
you reminded me of the girls who
did my nails when I had hands.

196
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,573
And I was like,

197
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,160
like I said,

198
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,510
tape.

199
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,860
It was like racism,

200
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,270
what the fuck?

201
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:39,104
Whoa.

202
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,243
I was like,

203
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,800
I was thinking like I want to bring
it up if I just met her any other way.

204
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,920
But since she brought up her hands,

205
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,401
I was like,

206
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:50,350
what happened to your hands?

207
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,080
And she said that she had,

208
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:53,350
um,

209
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:58,270
something wrong with her appendix went
to the hospital and the doctor put the

210
00:06:58,271 --> 00:06:59,104
wrong name,

211
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,330
like mixed up her charts and they
amputated her hands and her feet

212
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:10,000
when she was only supposed to get
her appendix taken out or something.

213
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:10,834
Very minor.

214
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,483
Yeah.

215
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,690
And then a few weeks after that
comedy show where I met her,

216
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,090
I saw on the front page
of the paper in New York,

217
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:22,330
it said so and so,

218
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,400
or whatever her name was.

219
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,234
I forgot her name.

220
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:24,930
Uh,

221
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,610
given $14 million or whatever,

222
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:26,851
you know,

223
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:29,010
like the settlement for
your hands and your feet.

224
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,210
I forget how much it was,

225
00:07:30,211 --> 00:07:31,470
but it was,

226
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,270
it was maybe longer.

227
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,250
And I met her boyfriend

228
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,640
go and you mentioned dating that happening
to your girlfriend and you're like,

229
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:39,981
yeah,

230
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:40,814
I'll stick around.

231
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:41,923
Right.

232
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,030
So crazy.

233
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,541
I asked him,

234
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:44,841
I said,

235
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:46,820
how long have you guys been together?

236
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,240
He was like a year when that happened.

237
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,260
Wow.

238
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:51,681
I was like,

239
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:52,160
well man,

240
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,570
you're such a good guy.

241
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,261
You know,

242
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:56,180
she can't even like wipe her ass

243
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,340
or maybe he went to the fucking
hospital and switch the things on here.

244
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,990
She is the founder

245
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,940
all right there.

246
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,220
But you know why she was so,

247
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,630
it's just so bizarre.

248
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,670
She was so happy that like,

249
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,253
you know,

250
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,510
you wonder like how,

251
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,940
how she can be happy.

252
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,860
But she was so like,

253
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,480
she was in such a good mood.

254
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:23,430
Like she was just like
loving the comedy show.

255
00:08:23,431 --> 00:08:26,280
She was so appreciative and like
she was having a great time.

256
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,180
Wow.
