1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,410
Confusion,
you don't get it,

2
00:00:01,411 --> 00:00:04,080
you don't get it through about 
subterfuge.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,340
Tom Papa,
who has a special this Friday coming out

4
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,020
on epic.

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,220
Oh,
no way.

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:13,883
Especially comedy.
He tells me he is hilarious and 

7
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:20,180
gregarious.
So

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,870
charming.
He's a fucking sour dough experts.

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,303
The sultan of sour dough.
Where'd you film your special Cleveland 

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,550
Cleveland's font.
I love Cleveland.

11
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:32,384
It's a good place to do it.
I'm going there for a long time and I 

12
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,270
love the people in Cleveland.
Would you do it?

13
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:37,800
What place?
Hannah theater?

14
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:38,703
Yeah,
and a playhouse square district kind of 

15
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,440
thing.
Really Nice Theater and uh,

16
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,283
you know,
I've been going to Cleveland for a long 

17
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:47,850
time.
I liked the people there.

18
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:50,880
It's got a good mix of,
you know,

19
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,760
hopefulness but grounded in reality.
But to make it a comeback,

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,020
it is that cities really making a 
comeback.

21
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,070
Craft Stores and craft breweries and 
nice restaurants.

22
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:02,904
And I know when I started going there 
you couldn't eat healthy if you tried 

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,320
like it was just corn beef and now,
you know,

24
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:12,900
15 years later there's Vegan 
restaurants,

25
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:14,620
there's all these like,
you know,

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,230
these noodle places.

27
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,970
It's just,
it's completely come up,

28
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:20,400
but you know when,
when Lebron left,

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,400
they were devastated.
How crazy is that?

30
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,490
The one guy,
the whole city just throws a ball into a

31
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:29,820
hole completely.
They took his banner off the side of the

32
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:34,821
building and it was over and since he 
came back and then one it.

33
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,980
Oh,
it's changed the whole place.

34
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,180
I don't remember how much they hated him
when he left.

35
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,970
I was like,
this is ridiculous.

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,280
Why are you so mad?
The guy had to get some money,

37
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,470
but it was real.
It was real.

38
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:49,380
Like there's a difference when you go 
there now people are like a pride.

39
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:50,214
They're walking around like,
well they have the heavyweight champion 

40
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:52,750
of the UFC to.
Oh,

41
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,200
do steep vimeo check.
He's from Cleveland to.

42
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,043
Yeah,
and the baseball team went to the world 

43
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,580
series,
so they were like really?

44
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,370
Like pretty fuckers,
but they have the brands,

45
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:04,890
which always is that bad.
They're bad,

46
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,783
but they had Jim Brown,
they had Jim Brown that still haven't 

47
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,270
won one game.
They haven't won one game this year.

48
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,850
How many games?
They played a.

49
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:15,684
we're up to nine or 10,
give him some time to work it out 

50
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,990
though,
but I really love that,

51
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,900
that city and I really liked it for 
standup and I figured it was a good mile

52
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:28,501
marker,
you know,

53
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:29,910
you do these specials and it's like,
okay,

54
00:02:29,911 --> 00:02:31,920
this was this period,
you know,

55
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,770
and uh,
I figured this is a good place.

56
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:35,604
I'd like to commemorate my time in 
Cleveland and this material at this 

57
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,410
point.
And it was good.

58
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,070
How often do you like to do specials?
Um,

59
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,250
this is my fourth and they come every 
like two and a half years.

60
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,453
Yeah,
it's pretty much the standard number 

61
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:54,204
now.
Everyone seems to like a lot of guys 

62
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:56,214
were trying to do them every year.
Like lily was doing one every year for 

63
00:02:57,991 --> 00:02:59,290
awhile.
But then he like,

64
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,040
you know what,
they're not

65
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,230
as good when I do it once.
A year later I call,

66
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,610
I called them a premise pilots.
There's a lot.

67
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,280
There was one of the last five years.
A lot of premise pilots,

68
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:11,800
like people just rushing them out.
It's like,

69
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:12,880
yeah,
that's a good idea.

70
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,220
Imagine in three years with that joke 
would be,

71
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,443
you know what I mean,
and that's the thing I think even two 

72
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,590
and a half years and I try and just do 
it when it's ready,

73
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:25,180
but I feel like you see two and a half 
years is kind of rushing it.

74
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:29,380
There's jokes if they stay in your act 
for five years,

75
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,740
it's no joke that that thing becomes 
something different.

76
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,570
They become better,
become better.

77
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,610
You find out where the beats are,
you find out where the pauses should be.

78
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,500
Find out where maybe there was some 
tags.

79
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,613
Yeah.
You developed along the way that lead 

80
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:44,740
you in a totally different direction.

81
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,753
You're thinking about it differently.
There's a confidence that you have in 

82
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,394
delivering it.
That's different than you just pushing 

83
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:51,670
it out there,
but you can't.

84
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:53,650
The way that people digest everything 
now.

85
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:55,180
You can't wait five years.
Yeah,

86
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,014
isn't that the issue is that you have a 
bunch of Tom Papa fans and they would 

87
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,610
like to come see you again,
but they want to see new shit.

88
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,710
It's not like the rolling stones,
you know?

89
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:03,544
If you go to see the rolling stones,
you want to hear sympathy for the devil 

90
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:07,720
even though they wrote it in 1967,
you know,

91
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:08,830
I know,
but you know,

92
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,664
I go back and forth on that because I'm 
sure you've had it where you are in 

93
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:13,744
shows and you,
you're at the end of your set or 

94
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,054
whatever.
People start yelling out old bits that 

95
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:18,460
they want to see.
Right.

96
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,503
And there's something I know that you 
want to be new and you always want to 

97
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:25,430
push and you always want to,
you know,

98
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,110
create.

99
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,550
That's cool.
But I think it sells these bits short to

100
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:31,384
think that nobody wants to see these 
again because I could watch you do that 

101
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:38,530
White House bit.
I know it.

102
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,350
I watched you working on it at the 
store.

103
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:44,620
I watched you developing it.
I've seen it a bunch,

104
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:49,730
a bunch.
I guarantee I could watch that bit every

105
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,400
week and like it and think it's funny,
when I worked with Seinfeld for years,

106
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,653
I would watch that guy for about seven 
straight years and I'd watch and hang 

107
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:00,880
out and watch.
Not the whole set,

108
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:04,000
but I see when I came up to a favorite 
bit of mine,

109
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,070
I was laughing.
I was laughing,

110
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,593
so I think you can.
I think we in our own heads think that 

111
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:12,700
people don't want to see this,
but they do want to see it.

112
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,440
Some do,
but the ones who don't,

113
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,251
when they say,
Oh,

114
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:18,490
you're doing the same old jokes,
that's so devastating.

115
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,070
You gotta keep moving.
I know you're right.

116
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,380
That does kill you.
The people does kill.

117
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:24,400
You.
Don't like it.

118
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,460
That feeling way outweighs where people 
that don't mind the old jokes again,

119
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,850
when I see people off after a,
after a set and like,

120
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,940
you know in the lobby or whatever and 
they're like,

121
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:41,170
we see you every time you come through.
We saw you two times last year.

122
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,723
I completely go.
The first question is did you see some 

123
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:48,640
new stuff?
And nine times out of 10 they look at me

124
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:49,960
like,
well yeah,

125
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:52,400
but it's all great.
Like they don't really care.

126
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,300
Like those fans really don't care.
I don't concentrate on those people.

127
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:58,070
Those people are too easily satisfied.
I concentrate on

128
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,380
the malcontents people that just can't 
wait to get on twitter immediately after

129
00:06:02,381 --> 00:06:03,214
the show was over,
I was still doing that White House 

130
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,150
fucking premise.
So tired to break in.

131
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:10,360
Happened in 2015 bro.
Yeah.

132
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,373
You know,
that's such a unique wormy type of a 

133
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:15,321
fan.
Yeah.

134
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:18,830
But those warming type of fans,
although they're not the happiest,

135
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:22,130
nicest people in the world,
they do keep you motivated in check.

136
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,510
Yeah.
The worst for sure.

137
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,353
What happened to a lot of comedians in 
the eighties is that they never wrote 

138
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:27,650
new material.
Yeah.

139
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,573
They just kept doing the same stuff.
They get 45 minutes and just wrote it 

140
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:31,934
out whole career.
They had a set and that like Jay Leno 

141
00:06:34,951 --> 00:06:36,500
still does that.
Yeah.

142
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:41,030
He is a brilliant comedian.
Like if you go back to the early days of

143
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:41,640
like,
uh,

144
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,260
the tonight show and the letterman show 
and yeah.

145
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,940
Leno was the edgy young guy.

146
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,410
Yeah.
That would come on.

147
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,680
And he was this great joke writer,
very relevant,

148
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,670
sit down,
boom.

149
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,504
But he put out a showtime special that 
I'm aware of that I watched a long time 

150
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:57,614
ago.
He might have found that and bought up 

151
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:00,680
every copy of it and burned it.
Yeah,

152
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,200
never seen it.
He doesn't put out anything now.

153
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,850
Nothing.
When he goes on stage,

154
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,713
he wants the audience to have no idea 
what his jokes are because they could 

155
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:10,010
never see them on the Internet.
They can't find him anywhere.

156
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,300
He said that to me once.
He's like,

157
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:13,100
why would you?
Why would you record?

158
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,450
Why would you put out an album?
You're killing your act because you your

159
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,200
act fee to your actors with.
Why would you just give that away?

160
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,900
But it's a different thing.
It's.

161
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,220
It's changed.
I think the media,

162
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,200
how people can digest this stuff has 
actually changed what a comedian is,

163
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:34,280
but with all due respect,
when people today think about Jay Leno,

164
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,430
they don't think of the great standup 
comedians today.

165
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,170
They don't think of Jay Leno even when 
even before the prior.

166
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,480
The rather cosby controversially went 
down.

167
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,510
Cosby was still considered all time 
great.

168
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,960
One of the all time greats,
right?

169
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,520
And Leno was in that ilk at one point in
time.

170
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,740
He's never.
He's not considered that.

171
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,900
No.
No.

172
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,270
And you think that's because the tonight
show,

173
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,280
do you think if he could have done the 
tonight show and put out?

174
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,353
Oh yeah,
for sure material he would have for 

175
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,020
sure.
I mean he has his no body of work.

176
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,280
Right?
That's a big.

177
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
That's a big problem.
It's,

178
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,253
it's everything.
There's a lot of guys that are really 

179
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:11,894
good that we all know.
Like Duncan trussell is a perfect 

180
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:14,660
example.
Duncan trussell is a brilliant comedian.

181
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,100
Yeah.
His no body of work.

182
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,140
Like he doesn't have anything out.
Right.

183
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,820
I know.
And you know,

184
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:20,654
that's kind of where,
where my head is at lately is whatever 

185
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:25,940
you're doing,
whatever you're hustling,

186
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:29,660
whatever you're trying to put out there,
it's all about making stuff.

187
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,940
It's all about making stuff that you're 
proud of.

188
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,490
So you know,
this is like the fourth one.

189
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:36,110
So now I can look back like,
all right,

190
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:37,970
this is,
this is growing,

191
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:40,420
this is stuff I'm proud of.
And then if I'm writing something,

192
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,030
like I just want to create as much as 
possible.

193
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,640
You know what I mean?
Oh yeah.

194
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,753
But,
but,

195
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,340
but there is definitely that side that,
you know,

196
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,901
I,
you know,

197
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:51,734
I came up during an era when you didn't 
just make an album because you could 

198
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:57,330
record it on your phone,
someone had to come and ask you,

199
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,670
you have to be good enough for someone 
to say,

200
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:00,504
I want to make something with you.
So I still have that feeling that I'm 

201
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:04,914
not good enough that.
So I don't want to put it out early 

202
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,560
because I don't feel like it's ready or 
it's worthy,

203
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,423
you know what I mean?

204
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,430
So I try and hold back as much as 
possible.

205
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,264
I don't feel like because Louis puts one
out every year that I have to put one 

206
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:25,890
out every year or to be so arrogant that
will Carlin did it every year.

207
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,980
Well that's George Carlin,
Carlin.

208
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:33,060
I mean it's hard to talk bad about 
Carlin because he's dead and he's one of

209
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:34,810
the all time greats,
but there's some,

210
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,770
some questionable stuff in there.
Wasn't that good?

211
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,120
Yeah.
There's some specials where.

212
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,920
Yeah,
I mean he had some brilliant jokes.

213
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:41,760
No,
no doubt about it.

214
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:43,830
But when you're doing a new hour every 
year,

215
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,640
some of it's just not up to the same 
standards as some of your classics.

216
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:50,190
Like he has some classics.
Oh my God,

217
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,230
the best.
But you know,

218
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,370
at the end he was calling himself a 
writer more than a comedian.

219
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:57,204
He said,
I like to be called a writer and that's 

220
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,430
how he was doing the act.

221
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,263
He was writing out.
He'd be at the comedy Magic Club with 

222
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:06,630
his printed out sheets,
memorizing like a play,

223
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,523
like memorizing all this material to 
then take it out and that's a different 

224
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:13,350
thing and you can put that together in a
year,

225
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,930
but it doesn't have the seasoning,
the confidence,

226
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:20,280
the ins and outs that if you just toured
with that for three years.

227
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,860
Oh my God.
What it would become.

228
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,660
Tours is a big thing too,
man,

229
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:27,810
because when I do a theater,
if I do a theater on a weekend,

230
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:28,644
like say if I do Friday night at a 
theater or a Saturday night at the 

231
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,240
theater,
there's a giant difference between doing

232
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:34,074
that and doing like a weekend.
The comedy works in Denver where you're 

233
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,830
doing four shows,
two shows,

234
00:10:37,831 --> 00:10:38,910
Friday,
two shows Saturday.

235
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:42,280
That's when bits come alive.
They get those extra taglines.

236
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,203
They get those extra.

237
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:47,310
You're so different from Thursday night 
for show Saturday.

238
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:49,230
Last show.
First one.

239
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:49,590
You're.
Yeah.

240
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,910
Okay.
I'm doing it and heal people.

241
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:53,370
Having a good time.
With Saturday,

242
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,680
you're just,
you're like a mat.

243
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:56,514
You can just kick back and just.
There's just this natural zone that you 

244
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:03,810
can be and that you don't have the.
You just don't have the confidence.

245
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,293
You know,
I have to be out there all the time and 

246
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:08,460
I think that's the hard part.
You know,

247
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,760
Jay,
back to Jay doing the tonight show.

248
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:12,594
He was working on that monologue.
I mean he was doing 12 minute 

249
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:18,600
monologues.
They even just thrown those away.

250
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,270
Let me just tell you this right now.
I don't,

251
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,113
I've never liked the fucking monologue 
ever in the history of late night 

252
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:24,414
television is not one where I'm like,
finally the monologue dog shit just go 

253
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,140
right.
Every joke sucks there.

254
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,120
It's a different type of them using it 
best,

255
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,610
but he.
But he would disagree because he,

256
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,613
he,
he said that lead letterman was doing a 

257
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:40,314
six minute monologue and people were 
turning off and go into the commercial 

258
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:44,460
and go onto the next thing.
So he said,

259
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:46,530
if I could keep it,
if I could do twice,

260
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:48,960
that people aren't changing,
and I,

261
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,590
he beat Letterman all the time from that
segment of the show,

262
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,900
the ratings were strong enough and he 
held onto them.

263
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,243
This is just as business mind working 
that he hung onto them and kept them in 

264
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:01,354
there.
And that's why he was number one all 

265
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,950
this time.
Well,

266
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,340
it was the hugh grant thing.
Remember when he ran on it,

267
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,210
he said,
what the hell were you thinking?

268
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,150
Right.
Which is a disingenuous question.

269
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:13,984
He was saying,
I don't want to get my dick sucked by 

270
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:17,200
this hot black chick and I pay her 
money.

271
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,590
She's going to do.
It was just awesome.

272
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,013
He knows what the fuck he taken.
But j dot really thought that the 

273
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:27,841
monologue was his was his thing and that
he had to pour everything into it and he

274
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:31,210
would work on it.
As soon as that one was over,

275
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,850
he,
he would fly off and do gigs in Vegas.

276
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:34,684
He was working on it constantly,
sending jokes to his guy coming in the 

277
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:40,990
next,
do 12 minutes of new jokes every day.

278
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,440
You're not writing your act.
You're not working on your act.

279
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,303
Right.
When you get busy and have other 

280
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,470
projects and stuff,
your acts,

281
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:48,304
you know,
if you've seen Craig Ferguson to stand 

282
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:52,810
up.
I have not.

283
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,910
He's doe does what he does now.
He's like,

284
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,680
he's a standup.
Yeah,

285
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,810
and he was doing it while he was doing 
the show.

286
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,080
I don't know how much he did before he 
did his show.

287
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,880
Yeah,
but then once he did a show,

288
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,410
like I would go places and they said,
yeah,

289
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:06,910
we had Craig Ferguson last night.
I'm like,

290
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,420
Craig Ferguson,
like that.

291
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,300
The talk show.
God didn't even know he was a comic.

292
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:11,140
Yeah.
And they'd go,

293
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:11,531
yeah,
yeah,

294
00:13:11,531 --> 00:13:12,400
he's a comic.
I'm like,

295
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:13,570
wow.
Interesting.

296
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,850
Just see.
Act.

297
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,833
Nope.
That's why I was asking you is what he 

298
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:18,900
does now.
He just decided I'd rather just do stand

299
00:13:18,901 --> 00:13:19,780
up.
Just.

300
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,040
Here's a weird one,
man.

301
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,250
They didn't get rid of him,
he just said I want to do it anymore.

302
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,120
I know he's one of the and then he's 
hosting like two different game shows.

303
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,050
Is He?
Yeah.

304
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,090
What are they?
He's got this one show where it's like a

305
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,033
kind of like two teams and they do 
charades against each other kind of a 

306
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:41,410
show and he's in the middle of it and 
then I did an appearance on his new show

307
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:42,244
on a national geographic or history,
I think it was history and he brought a 

308
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:46,630
panel out.

309
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:51,190
It was me and lars from metallica and a 
writer and we had discussed,

310
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,710
it was like little lists,
like I forget the name of it.

311
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,573
It was like the list of something and we
had to pick like the top five bands of 

312
00:13:56,981 --> 00:14:01,660
all time and it's just like this funny 
game show talk show kind of a thing,

313
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,440
but he's always popping up and doing 
that kind of stuff.

314
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,020
So he just didn't want to see what his 
act was like because whenever.

315
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,340
Yeah,
whenever I hear that.

316
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:10,174
My first.
My first inkling is always probably 

317
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:16,250
telling stories about celebrities.
Kathy Griffin style.

318
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,213
Yeah,
like you ever watch comedians and then 

319
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,210
become famous and then they start 
telling stories about,

320
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,000
oh,
this is when I ran into so and so in the

321
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:27,330
locker room and you know,
it's all celebrity stuff because they're

322
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:29,770
not living their life.
But Ferguson,

323
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:30,963
I had heard that like he used to write a
lot and he was always trying to like 

324
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:36,460
come up with stuff,
so maybe it's a real act.

325
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,253
Well,
the people that worked at the theater 

326
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,630
that I worked at or you know there the 
night before they said it was funny.

327
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,490
Yeah.
So I would like to see it,

328
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,070
see what that's about,
but I always,

329
00:14:47,071 --> 00:14:48,700
I always find it interesting when people
just,

330
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,320
they get some sort of a mainstream gig 
that.

331
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:52,730
And they do it for awhile and like,
Oh,

332
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,170
I'm,
I'm done.

333
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,123
Yeah,
I'm done.

334
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,110
Well,
he got passed over for Letterman.

335
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,371
Oh,
is that what it is?

336
00:14:58,371 --> 00:15:00,080
Is that why he quit?
He didn't get that job.

337
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,550
That's when it all went down.
Yeah.

338
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:03,350
Meanwhile,
that job sucks.

339
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,060
Yeah.
I'm going,

340
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,380
look,
it's a tough.

341
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:09,340
Just happened into core bear Kobe.
Nobody likes anymore.

342
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,363
I'm completely loved them.
I'm going to stuck with that other 

343
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:14,570
fucking job.
Cold Bear as Cole Bear,

344
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,590
whereas.
Great.

345
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,483
Yeah.
Cole bear as whoever the fuck he really 

346
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:18,800
is.

347
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,610
I don't like that guy.
He needed.

348
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,250
When he was on,
he had Gaffigan on and Maria Shriver and

349
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:28,610
they were all talking about how great it
is to be in a cat to be a catholic.

350
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,751
I'm like,
check,

351
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:32,160
please get the foot on the show.
Yeah.

352
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,260
Oh really?
The Catholics.

353
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:34,490
Amazing.
There's a billion of us.

354
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:35,210
I'm like,
what?

355
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,040
What really?
What am I watching?

356
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:39,320
Like because Kobe is like a serious 
Catholic.

357
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,400
Yeah,
I knew that,

358
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:43,880
but I didn't know.
It was bizarre.

359
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,470
I'm doing that show on Thursday.
Yeah,

360
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:50,700
bring it up.
I'm going to show up.

361
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,940
Dressed like the pope.
See what they say.

362
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,530
You get mad at you just wear the wizard 
costume.

363
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,660
It's a full.
It's a weird job.

364
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,093
It's a very weird job.
You're basically selling other people's 

365
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,280
stuff.
[inaudible].

366
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,050
Yeah.
And all the time.

367
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,820
And you have these little short sound 
bytes.

368
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,150
I did Conan back when he was in New York
and uh,

369
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,501
I,
uh,

370
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:13,334
it was,
I don't know how many times I had done 

371
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:14,570
the show.

372
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,890
I did it a lot,
I don't know,

373
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,690
probably the eighth time.
And uh,

374
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:19,963
I was there with the show was over and 
Conan's walking through the halls and 

375
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:25,490
he's got his guitar with him and he 
comes over and,

376
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:26,241
uh,
I said,

377
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:27,380
uh,
thanks for having me.

378
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,500
That's so great.
I love coming in here because yeah,

379
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,343
it's great for you because you get to 
come in here and do the show and then 

380
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:37,640
you get to leave and go about your life.
I'm here every single day.

381
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:41,450
He starts playing on the guitar thing,
thing thing every single day.

382
00:16:41,451 --> 00:16:44,210
I never leave these halls every single 
day.

383
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,070
I was like,
it really sunk in.

384
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,180
Like,
was he serious?

385
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,620
He was serious.
Was He bummed out?

386
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,910
It just a little,
you know,

387
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:51,880
one of those magic moments of,
you know who,

388
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,930
but your.
That's in New York now.

389
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:56,240
He's been doing the show for how many 
more years?

390
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,310
Yeah,
I did it way.

391
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,510
That's a real New York and he had a 
punching bag.

392
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,890
Yes.
In his office.

393
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,340
Was he get crazy when he gets frustrated
and shuts wailing on that thing.

394
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,260
Fucking network.
Wham,

395
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:07,010
wham,
Wham,

396
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,720
wham.
I want the tonight show.

397
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,130
Yeah,
yeah.

398
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,480
No,
that's a real gig.

399
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:12,380
I mean,
you just.

400
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,240
That's a different life.
You're.

401
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,950
That was a weird moment too in the 
annals of Showbiz history when they gave

402
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:21,770
him the Gig and then they put Leno on 
before him.

403
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,000
So crazy.
I'm like,

404
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,820
what are you doing?
Like what is this was on a 10?

405
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,773
Yeah,
and then you guys are cannibalizing 

406
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:29,990
yourself.
Brutal.

407
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,460
You have to talk.
Show hosts in a row.

408
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,520
How do you choose who goes on?
What show?

409
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,020
Oh,
like what are you doing?

410
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,540
Who did that?
Whose idea was that?

411
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,190
Jeff Zucker.
I think Jeff.

412
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:41,024
I Love Jeff.
Jeff's a great guy and I know Jeff gave 

413
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:45,470
me my first break on television,
but he was,

414
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,630
holy cow.
That was a weird moment.

415
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,710
Well,
did.

416
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,330
I mean,
imagine if your cone.

417
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,710
Imagine if you're the guy that you get 
the tonight,

418
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:55,530
show your lifelong dream and then the 
guy you took it from,

419
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,010
they tell you he's going to go on before
you because your ratings are so.

420
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,570
So we're going to put him on at 10:00.
Oh,

421
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,660
and then you've got to go out there and 
give them a log.

422
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,150
How much time went by before they put 
Leno on before?

423
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:10,470
Um,
uh,

424
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,120
it wasn't that long.
They don't give you much.

425
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:17,460
It wasn't that long,
I want to say maybe a year maybe.

426
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,920
But his,
it just wasn't hitting well.

427
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:23,220
It's one of those things where to,
in order for a show to develop,

428
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,160
it has to find its legs.
The guy like what?

429
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,830
You have to have faith in whoever's 
doing it that they're going to figure it

430
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:29,310
out.
Yeah,

431
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,000
right.
Yeah.

432
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,340
But they don't always do that.
They don't always have faith.

433
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,440
And then they put tremendous pressure on
you.

434
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,543
And then advertisers don't want to spend
money because the ratings aren't high 

435
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:41,130
enough.
So you bleeding revenue and you have all

436
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:41,964
these producers and everyone sketching.
Everyone has their own idea of how to 

437
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,730
juice it up and then they have crashes 
and pressure and what's so strange to me

438
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:52,050
in that scenario when it was all going 
down,

439
00:18:52,051 --> 00:18:54,510
when he had his thing in New York,
it was locked in.

440
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:58,800
He had his fans.
It was solid and doing the same thing in

441
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:01,800
a bigger studio across the country.
It was different.

442
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,770
It was weirder.
It was area or something was.

443
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:08,340
It was also on earlier.
There was more expectations.

444
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:12,810
It was more mainstream expectations like
that late thing is kind of like relaxed.

445
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,673
Like Carson Carson daily was on TV 
forever and no one noticed and they 

446
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:17,454
still doing it.
He's still just kind of get away with 

447
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,720
that at 2:00
in the morning and just like,

448
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:22,840
hey,
we're good.

449
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,250
See You tomorrow.
Don't care,

450
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,470
and we're still doing it.
Yeah,

451
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:29,370
for it's still buying time on that show.
Does Not Dishonor Carson Daly at all.

452
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,430
It's very nice guy.
No,

453
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,310
but it's being protected.
You're protected.

454
00:19:32,311 --> 00:19:33,144
You don't.
You don't have that pressure of 

455
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,853
expectations being in that thing.
I was there for the very early days of 

456
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:42,090
Conan because my friend Amir Mirror was 
one of the writers on Conan show,

457
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,043
so I went to like one of the third or 
fourth tapings and when they had the 

458
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:51,660
monologue scripted and they had it on 
giant cue cards,

459
00:19:51,661 --> 00:19:52,494
it was really gross for the audience 
because right behind Andy Richter be 

460
00:19:56,611 --> 00:19:57,444
someone holding a cue card and behind 
Conan would be someone holding a cue 

461
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:04,470
card and it had like Conan Andy and then
yes.

462
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,423
The words they would say,
so they would have a scripted like this 

463
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,710
conversation were happening.
Yeah.

464
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,593
Would be scripted.

465
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,030
Weird,
bizarre.

466
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,430
It's crazy is if there's a bizarre right
after you.

467
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,680
Now you.
Now you go.

468
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,220
It's funny you mentioned that because 
our next guest is weird as well.

469
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,020
Somebody had to go up to Kona to go,
listen,

470
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:29,460
we need to script your monologue and 
then we need to script your dialogue.

471
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,190
We need to script your banter.
We need to script everything.

472
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:33,570
We're leaving.
Nothing to chance.

473
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,970
Just that.
It wasn't good.

474
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,283
It wasn't good.
It was very awkward in the day and I 

475
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:42,150
think he found himself and became like 
this sort of Zany.

476
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,710
His show on guy is still super creative.
It's still.

477
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,180
I mean it's,
you

478
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,013
know,
not that many people see it as compared 

479
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:52,780
to the old days,
but he'd,

480
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:55,180
they're always doing original funny 
stuff like it.

481
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,770
It's alive,
you know.

482
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,040
I don't know how you keep doing that for
that many years,

483
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:05,041
but it is a unique really funny place on
television for sure.

484
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,810
It's his job.
I mean that's what he does.

485
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,160
Yeah.
That's his thing.

486
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:10,270
That's his gig.
Yeah,

487
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,950
it is a,
it's a.

488
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:12,784
You know what else was awkward too?
Here's the thing that sucks the most 

489
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:17,980
about those shows is that like you have 
these six,

490
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,823
seven minutes segments where you just 
sit down and you just kind of force a 

491
00:21:22,391 --> 00:21:23,224
bunch of subjects and to these sick like
he had drawn the other day and in one 

492
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,130
thing there was like this really awkward
segway.

493
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:32,590
What about the NFL?
I know the NFL,

494
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,161
bob is.
He was like,

495
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:33,994
what?
Like they were just talking about trump 

496
00:21:36,341 --> 00:21:39,760
and then they just switch gear,
like super awkward segway.

497
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,150
Yeah.
And you're looking down at the car,

498
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,090
jumps right into it.
I'm like,

499
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:44,400
oh,
I guess he got to.

500
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,640
Yeah.
But you know,

501
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,013
I really feel as a comedian,
that's what comedians are the best 

502
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:49,570
guests on.
Those shows.

503
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:52,210
Like you should just sit down and go,
just go.

504
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:55,870
I watch Rodney doing the tonight show 
with Johnny Carson.

505
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,780
Did A,
did a six minute set,

506
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,880
you know,
standing there doing his thing.

507
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,930
They all right,
great.

508
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:02,764
And then he walks over,
he sits down and then four minutes 

509
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,060
Johnny asked him one question and he 
just went.

510
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,260
He just joke,
joke,

511
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:08,891
joke,
joke,

512
00:22:08,891 --> 00:22:10,390
joke and it.
Oh really?

513
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:11,021
Yeah.
Joke,

514
00:22:11,021 --> 00:22:11,790
joke,
joke.

515
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,060
Good night everybody.
I mean,

516
00:22:13,061 --> 00:22:13,894
that's your job.
Why do we have to make this look like 

517
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,420
it's a conversation?
Especially with a guy like Rodney.

518
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,070
He was just,
that's where he was in his element.

519
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,840
Oh,
just rapid fire.

520
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,580
Oh yeah.
My doctor.

521
00:22:25,581 --> 00:22:28,270
Let me tell Ya,
you know the story of Rodney,

522
00:22:28,271 --> 00:22:31,540
how he took more than a decade off of 
show business,

523
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,820
but the entire time he was writing 
jokes,

524
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,200
but he's selling aluminum siding and 
trim.

525
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,073
Yeah.
Didn't keep the jokes like in a 

526
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:38,770
briefcase or something,
I don't know,

527
00:22:38,771 --> 00:22:39,604
but he just kept writing.
So when he came back and started doing 

528
00:22:41,591 --> 00:22:43,720
standup again,
which I believe was in his forties.

529
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,100
Yeah,
it was in his forties.

530
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,620
He had massive amounts of material.
Amazing.

531
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,590
I heard that he.
Is this true.

532
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:51,424
Have you ever heard this?
That he had switched acts with another 

533
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:57,160
comic that he wasn't going anywhere and 
his buddy wasn't going anywhere and they

534
00:22:57,161 --> 00:23:00,030
switched acts if you ever heard that.
No,

535
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:00,940
no,
no.

536
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:02,410
I never heard that.
Yeah.

537
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,080
I don't know.
I don't know if it's true or not,

538
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,910
but what a funny dude.

539
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,680
Apparently the risk like respect.
No respect at all.

540
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,360
God Damn it.
I'm trying to find out what,

541
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,070
what movie it was that caused him to 
change it from.

542
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,410
I used to be like,
I can't catch a break,

543
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,620
like Hannah early.
Oh really?

544
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,390
Tagline.
And then he changed it to,

545
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,250
I don't get no respect,
no respect,

546
00:23:27,251 --> 00:23:29,530
no respect at all.
And then clicks,

547
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,423
see,
see if he can find out the origin of 

548
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:32,350
that.
Jamie.

549
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,183
That's amazing.
There was like a specific reason why he 

550
00:23:35,351 --> 00:23:40,090
went to from like this one cat to 
respect.

551
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,760
Fuck.
I'm trying to remember who told me.

552
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,490
Someone who was like a giant Rodney Fan.
He was Dave Smith.

553
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,860
Was it Dave Smith,
the comedian that came in here?

554
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,753
Maybe.
So at some point he was saying things 

555
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:53,470
just don't go well for me.
Something along wasn't.

556
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,670
It just wasn't,
isn't that weird?

557
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,990
Just those little words.

558
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,480
Just those and catchy and get her done.
Get her done.

559
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:01,550
Really.
I mean her dad is a classic.

560
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,730
Things are just.
They just catch why.

561
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:05,564
Remember when Chappelle could not go on 
stage because dumb drunk white boys 

562
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,560
would yell out,
I'm Rick James Bitch.

563
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,960
It was always white guys too because 
they were so hooked on it.

564
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,080
Hooked on it.
I know.

565
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,900
Sorry Dave.
Sorry.

566
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,740
White guys do.
I'm a white guy myself.

567
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:25,190
So that was a giant,
giant problem.

568
00:24:25,191 --> 00:24:29,360
Like he would saw him at the House of 
Blues in Vegas and literally show it was

569
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:31,830
a clusterfuck because people just 
yelling out,

570
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,560
I'm Rick James,
Bitch.

571
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,730
It's weird.
Like it's in the one side.

572
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:40,190
It's like people love you so much,
but the other side he's like,

573
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:41,810
you're killing me.
You're killing me.

574
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,810
Well that was a saying that people love 
to say.

575
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,450
They just love to say I'm Rick James 
Bitch.

576
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,480
So they would just see them right there 
and they just want to yell it out.

577
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,850
I'm going to feel it.
I want to feel that sound.

578
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,260
Yes.
Sacha Baron Cohen.

579
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:55,580
Right.
How long was he walking around?

580
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:57,620
Like my wave.
Right,

581
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,260
right.
I have no catchphrases.

582
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,300
I always went,
when I was young comic,

583
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:05,570
I watched a guy.
I opened for some guy in like Virginia.

584
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:06,404
It was like one of my first row things 
ever and this guy was really hacky and 

585
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:14,780
he had a line in his act and then he 
would sell the t shirt with that line.

586
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,480
Oh God.
And then he was also getting drunk,

587
00:25:17,481 --> 00:25:19,760
you know,
as for the second show.

588
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,773
And he did the second show and brought 
the tee shirt out at the end and there 

589
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:26,990
was no response because he had forgot.
He was so drunk.

590
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:30,470
He forgot to do the hacky bit to sell 
his t shirt.

591
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,383
I saw that and I was like,
I don't care how much money he's making 

592
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:37,670
him selling these shirts.
I am not going down that road.

593
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,370
That's a big thing though for road guys 
is merge,

594
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,990
merge.
They go nuts with the merge,

595
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,480
merge.
Such a bad businessman.

596
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,960
I just feel like it's all about the 
show.

597
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,790
It's about the show.
It's about me on stage.

598
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:54,050
This was great.
I can't go to the lobby and start making

599
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:55,940
change for twenties.
I can't do it.

600
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,633
Can't.
I've sold t shirts and like one or two 

601
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:01,694
shows ever.
And I show sold cds at one or two shows 

602
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,810
ever.
And then I'm like,

603
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:07,040
I can't do it anymore.
Right.

604
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:10,740
What is that?
Why these people already paid this?

605
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,220
First of all today?
They could always get your stuff.

606
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,670
They can always go online and who wants 
a physical copy of anything anyway?

607
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,440
Right?
A DVD or something.

608
00:26:18,441 --> 00:26:19,274
Like what the fuck,
what?

609
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,590
My computer doesn't even have a slot for
it.

610
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,990
It's right.
Exactly.

611
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,580
You ever see what a Pablo does?
No,

612
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,370
not Pablo.
I'm Gabriel.

613
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,540
Gabriel.
No,

614
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,580
no.
Look all those Mexicans.

615
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,950
Third one.
It's not even a third.

616
00:26:33,951 --> 00:26:34,980
Was the other one.
The other one.

617
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,550
Your guy.
The big controversy guy.

618
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,980
The Celia.
I'm in steel.

619
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:44,010
Yeah.
He records his set and then he

620
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,903
has a guy,
his opener when he's done goodnight 

621
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:47,064
everybody.
The opener comes up and does another 10 

622
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:53,961
minutes while on this disk drive.
They burn all of these little,

623
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:55,770
uh,
what do they call them?

624
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:56,604
Thumb drives of what you just saw.
So you can buy the original set of what 

625
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:04,200
you just saw on your way out that smart.
Then he has another guy,

626
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,650
takes pictures and uh,
and sells those.

627
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:09,210
You can get a picture taken with it.
I mean,

628
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,090
it's a huge picture.
Taking is gross.

629
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:12,983
Huge.
Charging people to take a picture is 

630
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:15,421
gross.
Yeah.

631
00:27:15,421 --> 00:27:17,640
And then they put it in a laminate.
You can have like a degrees.

632
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:18,523
So go see Santa.
You can get the cocking get one copy or 

633
00:27:21,031 --> 00:27:23,130
you can get the thing in the laminate 
with the snowflakes on it.

634
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,750
I kind of feel bad calling them in 
steel.

635
00:27:24,751 --> 00:27:26,490
You again,
like I'm shitting on him always down.

636
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,740
[inaudible].
I should just let it go.

637
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,873
But the photograph thing,
like charging people to take a 

638
00:27:32,221 --> 00:27:33,810
photograph.
There was always that he always did.

639
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:35,880
That was like,
that is just gross.

640
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,440
Just take a picture with people.
They're nice.

641
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,390
They want to take a picture with you.
It's not hard to do.

642
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,293
I don't mind going out and talking to 
them and letting them take their 

643
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:44,500
pictures and just saying hello to 
people.

644
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:48,850
I just can't get into the selling thing 
because I hear you.

645
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:53,050
If you're sensitive about your work and 
you get through the set and you've done,

646
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,990
he put everything you had into it and 
you think they had a good time.

647
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,453
Let's not judge each other for another 
time on the way out of the building 

648
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,090
with.
You know what I mean?

649
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,330
Let's just have a nice moment.
Let's not make it.

650
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,343
Oh,
now he wants me to buy a shirt from 

651
00:28:06,371 --> 00:28:06,790
them.

652
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,623
Yeah.
Would it be nice to just say hi to 

653
00:28:08,411 --> 00:28:11,220
people to not have to take a photograph 
because I mean,

654
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,063
I know,
I understand that people want to take 

655
00:28:12,581 --> 00:28:14,170
photographs and I,
I'm happy to take them,

656
00:28:14,171 --> 00:28:18,160
but it's like that moment and then 
becomes this pose instead of like,

657
00:28:18,161 --> 00:28:18,730
Hey,
what's up?

658
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,563
How are you?
Nice to meet.

659
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,010
Yeah,
right,

660
00:28:21,011 --> 00:28:21,850
exactly.
You know,

661
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,850
like everybody,
like people can't meet anybody anymore.

662
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,773
Everybody has to.
You have to immediately get your phone 

663
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,410
out and it doesn't matter what you're 
doing.

664
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,270
People want to take,
like I went to see,

665
00:28:31,271 --> 00:28:32,104
um,
honey honey and Gary Clark Jr the other 

666
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,110
night,
late night show,

667
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,690
midnight at the down and out in downtown
La.

668
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,193
And while the show's going on,
like we're standing there watching the 

669
00:28:41,171 --> 00:28:42,004
show and people were grabbing my arm,
trying to get me to take pictures with 

670
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:45,500
him.
I'm like,

671
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,040
stop not taking a picture.

672
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,660
I'd love that.
That beginning of,

673
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:49,860
uh,
of your special.

674
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,920
The first thing you said was put your 
phone down yet because there's special.

675
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:59,160
Literally the first thing out of your 
mouth was put your phone.

676
00:28:59,161 --> 00:29:01,450
They can't be in the moment,
bitch.

677
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,283
Yeah,
meanwhile I'd take videos of Gary Clark 

678
00:29:04,601 --> 00:29:09,601
when he's on stage of the day.
I know it's all part of the experience,

679
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,070
but I wanted to promote them to c,
one,

680
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,200
six explained.
Oh,

681
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,000
the origin of respect.
Here it goes.

682
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,670
I had this joke,
I play hide and seek won't even look for

683
00:29:18,671 --> 00:29:21,490
me to make it worse.
He looked for something and put in front

684
00:29:21,491 --> 00:29:22,510
of it.
I was so poor.

685
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:24,070
I was so dumb.
So this.

686
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,400
So that I thought now what fits that 
joke?

687
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:31,690
Well no one liked me was all right,
but then I thought a more profound thing

688
00:29:31,691 --> 00:29:33,220
would be.
I get no respect.

689
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,720
That's not totally true.
There was a movie,

690
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,870
there was something,
there was a movie about some,

691
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:41,723
some movie that had something about 
respect in it is wikipedia says pretty 

692
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:48,580
much the same thing that it came from 
like appearances on the Ed Sullivan show

693
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:51,400
and that this is like almost the same 
thing.

694
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:52,530
It tells a joke right here.
No,

695
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,830
I'm sure.
I'm sure,

696
00:29:53,831 --> 00:29:58,300
but someone told me the history of like,
deciding respect,

697
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:01,030
that it was based on some movie that was
famous at the time,

698
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:02,380
like maybe even a mob movie.

699
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,520
It's weird,
like when you look at listening,

700
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,413
not remembering Shit,
when you look at that list of comedians 

701
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:13,030
and it's like Tim Allen had the EU and 
then uh,

702
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,663
you know,
everybody does have a little hooky 

703
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,063
thing.
Tennessee now that you might be a 

704
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:21,360
redneck.
Oh yeah.

705
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,250
You might be a redneck was giant.
Yeah.

706
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,113
You know,
that was one of the first bits I saw 

707
00:30:25,061 --> 00:30:29,640
them in CSD now that.
Oh yeah,

708
00:30:29,641 --> 00:30:30,510
redneck.
Oh yeah,

709
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,950
no.
Oh yeah.

710
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,150
Oh,
pre-internet.

711
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,340
How 90?
Four.

712
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,070
Oh my goodness.
That's when I realized I was like,

713
00:30:38,071 --> 00:30:43,071
what your family tree does not.
Fork is one of those.

714
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,581
Really.
Yeah.

715
00:30:44,581 --> 00:30:45,840
I was like,
Holy Shit.

716
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,000
Oh my God.
Yeah.

717
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,190
I feel like the,
the taking the picture is kind of better

718
00:30:53,191 --> 00:30:58,191
than talking to them though,
because I always find like I want to.

719
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:03,150
They'll say something about the act or 
something and then the first sentence is

720
00:31:03,151 --> 00:31:03,750
great.

721
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,290
Be Like,
oh,

722
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,820
it was really funny.
I love when you did the thing.

723
00:31:05,821 --> 00:31:06,451
Oh,
that's good.

724
00:31:06,451 --> 00:31:10,350
I've been working on that and then I 
want to talk real about it,

725
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,573
about the act and then they,
I always find myself like they meet you 

726
00:31:14,401 --> 00:31:15,181
and they're like,
oh this is great.

727
00:31:15,181 --> 00:31:16,014
I get to talk to them and then you start
talking and then they ended up slowly 

728
00:31:18,481 --> 00:31:21,780
walking away and you're like,
I've been really working on this bit.

729
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:25,920
I'm having a hard time with the tag and 
trying to just kind of drift away.

730
00:31:25,921 --> 00:31:27,000
Like,
oh,

731
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,430
he's not as much fun as we thought.
Oh,

732
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:31,500
you mean you didn't just make that up on
the spot.

733
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,280
So I feel like if they take a picture,
we'd get through it and move on.

734
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,753
Yeah.
Well Jamie and I do this thing that I 

735
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:44,140
stole from Steevo Steve Idea.
It's a great idea.

736
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,063
Steve takes photos,
but then you have to go to his website 

737
00:31:47,501 --> 00:31:48,334
to get the photos.
That way people don't fumble with their 

738
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:52,750
cameras and I tried them once because 
the phones take fucking.

739
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,160
Nobody knows how to use her God damn 
phone.

740
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:54,971
Oh,
take my picture.

741
00:31:54,971 --> 00:31:57,130
How does this work?
If you give someone an android phone,

742
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,260
you might as well give him a fucking 
thesaurus.

743
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,663
Give them a book to read.
Nobody knows how to work a fucking 

744
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:03,650
android phone.

745
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,200
I tried to do it.
I had my buddy take pictures and then we

746
00:32:06,201 --> 00:32:08,660
posted them on the line and they could 
go get them.

747
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,673
First of all,
everybody was so then you spent the 

748
00:32:10,821 --> 00:32:12,920
whole time saying,
can I just take it with my phone,

749
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,860
knows how we do it?
He got iris.

750
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,060
Say that a higher one.
Security people at the club say,

751
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,103
put your phones away.
The pictures will be available online 

752
00:32:21,451 --> 00:32:22,284
tonight.
This is the only way to do what you do 

753
00:32:23,581 --> 00:32:25,470
in thousands of photos though.
He's only one way.

754
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,151
Do it.
Yeah,

755
00:32:26,151 --> 00:32:26,984
if you're doing that,
that's why I sit in the back and eat a 

756
00:32:28,341 --> 00:32:30,260
salad and wait for the second show.
That's good.

757
00:32:30,261 --> 00:32:31,940
Move too.
I know that's a good move.

758
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,170
I know it depends on where you're at too
though.

759
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,663
Like that's.
Do you like comedy clubs or do you like 

760
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,060
working theaters like this place in 
Cleveland?

761
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,913
How many seats were there?

762
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,180
Uh,
it was about 600.

763
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,820
That's a good time or something like 
that.

764
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:44,960
Yeah,
that was perfect.

765
00:32:44,961 --> 00:32:47,570
Perfect size.
I did the fillmore in San Francisco.

766
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:49,220
That's where I did my special,
which is smaller than that.

767
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,840
It's like 4:50,
4:50.

768
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,340
Yeah.
Perfect.

769
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:52,911
Yeah,
that's good.

770
00:32:52,911 --> 00:32:53,290
It's good.
It's.

771
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:57,080
It's perfect,
but it's not as good as the comedy works

772
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,440
because the economy works is a low 
ceiling like,

773
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,650
oh yeah,
I had a high ceiling.

774
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,360
Low ceilings are where it's at,
man.

775
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:06,170
Those little jammed up like there's no 
room at the comedy store rooms.

776
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:11,240
People don't realize what that energy is
such a real real thing.

777
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:15,620
It is a real thing given back and forth.
You're writing this.

778
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:18,230
There's a.
it's not a mystical just.

779
00:33:18,231 --> 00:33:20,750
It's a real.
I'm getting from them.

780
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,450
I'm giving it back.
We're playing with this energy.

781
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,200
That's why if you do an outdoor show,
it sucks because it's just poof.

782
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,780
Just evaporating.
It's going up like smoke.

783
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,060
One thing.
Did you have any hecklers?

784
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,600
No.
Right?

785
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,543
Three out of four shows.
People heckled really three of the four 

786
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,720
and they weren't even being mean.
They were just.

787
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,590
They wanted to talk.
They just wanted to get on the show.

788
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,790
They love you.
Even asked people before the show,

789
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:44,960
I said,
I'm filming here.

790
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,880
Please don't yell on it.
Anything.

791
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,470
They still did probably so mad at them.
People were so mad at them.

792
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,240
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

793
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:54,910
And then the crates this riff,
people like,

794
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:59,380
shut the fuck up.
She's taping now.

795
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,110
My,
uh,

796
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,943
my people were a little civilized.
Maybe your people are more civilized 

797
00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:04,190
than other people.
They're middle aged women.

798
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,340
They might get a lot of that.
I get a lot of,

799
00:34:07,341 --> 00:34:08,990
uh,
I get a lot of family,

800
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,090
females,
a lot of,

801
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:14,240
a lot of,
a lot of side boob selfies at the end of

802
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:14,860
the show.

803
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,900
Drunk can lipstick on your teeth.
Oh my God.

804
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,773
They have their husbands taking their 
picture and they're squeezing your ass 

805
00:34:20,871 --> 00:34:24,050
as they're squeezing and clawing your 
back,

806
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,810
doing the finger thing on your back to 
let you know they're interested.

807
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,910
Excited.
It's a nice moment for a married man.

808
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,350
Just grill.
Go back to your hotel.

809
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:36,020
Still likes me.
Put a little pop in your masturbation at

810
00:34:36,021 --> 00:34:36,854
night.
What about her sleeping pills for 

811
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,160
comics?
Yeah,

812
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:47,040
but no,
uh,

813
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,190
but no,
a hecklers.

814
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,930
It was pretty.
It was pretty smooth.

815
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,310
It was pretty.
It was pretty good.

816
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,293
Yeah.
My crowd's a little wild maybe to calm 

817
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,040
down.
Now they're passionate.

818
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,540
Bring them when you play.
We live.

819
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:00,374
When you just do live then you probably 
don't care and you mess with them and 

820
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,750
sometimes,
but you don't want them ruining bits.

821
00:35:05,751 --> 00:35:08,180
And that happens all the time.
That's the word idiot.

822
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,690
Ruined Chris Rock's bit the other night 
at the comedy store.

823
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,530
Really?
Oh my God.

824
00:35:12,531 --> 00:35:13,364
Chris rock this rocket,
this bit about cops and this guy just 

825
00:35:15,651 --> 00:35:18,650
fucking interrupted.
And then Chris,

826
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,533
you know,
Chris was joking around with them at 

827
00:35:20,781 --> 00:35:24,170
first and then the guy interrupted again
and then Chris was like,

828
00:35:24,171 --> 00:35:26,660
you dumb motherfucker.
I'm doing jokes up here.

829
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:27,830
Like,
what are you doing man?

830
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:31,250
And they wound up kicking the guy out 
and as they're kicking the guy,

831
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:31,821
I was like,
whoa.

832
00:35:31,821 --> 00:35:33,960
I can't open opinion.
Like fucking.

833
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,010
No you can't.
You can definitely have an opinion.

834
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,250
You don't want to interrupt

835
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:42,210
a performance like this agreement.
The audience has an agreement.

836
00:35:42,211 --> 00:35:43,044
Okay.
The agreement is you're going to sit 

837
00:35:43,681 --> 00:35:46,570
there and you get to see what this 
person is prepared right now.

838
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:47,843
Person's prepared,
but he came on stage with a fucking 

839
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:51,210
notebook,
but that's a weird thing,

840
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:52,044
but that's the.

841
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,450
That's the,
you know,

842
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,380
that's the illusion that we create.
If you're good.

843
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,750
It does.
It sounds like it's just happening.

844
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,930
It sounds like it's in the moment.
It doesn't sound planned out,

845
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,940
so they think that they're in the moment
with you.

846
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:07,200
Well,
rock rock is so opinion heavy.

847
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,320
Like Chris Rock's premises are always 
like,

848
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,010
yeah,
he's,

849
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,860
he's a master at taking a controversial 
premise,

850
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:18,660
taking a controversial point of view and
then bring it around so that when at the

851
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,493
end of it you're just howling laughing 
because he's figured out a way to like 

852
00:36:21,961 --> 00:36:23,160
he's right.
He's right.

853
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:28,000
I know he is the master bitter divorce 
shit to A.

854
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,490
I've been waiting for that to come out.

855
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:36,220
I've been waiting for that to come out.
I don't know if he had a prenup.

856
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,440
Seems like you didn't.
Oh really?

857
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,560
Yeah.
It seems like there's a lot,

858
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:44,610
a lot of fucking.
A lot of fuel was just talking about how

859
00:36:44,861 --> 00:36:49,270
much money the lawyers make and a wife's
going after all of it.

860
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:51,663
Brutal,
and he was talking about how that's why 

861
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,770
he's touring really has like,
I gotta make some money,

862
00:36:56,771 --> 00:36:58,070
man.
God,

863
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,261
which is,
look,

864
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:00,094
if you've developed a nest egg,
like obviously has and all of a sudden 

865
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,800
you're getting divorced.
Phil Hartman,

866
00:37:05,801 --> 00:37:06,634
try to explain that to me once that I 
was telling them to get a divorce for 

867
00:37:08,261 --> 00:37:09,610
his wife,
shot him in his sleep.

868
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:13,220
Ego will just give her half.
He goes,

869
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,600
he goes,
it's two thirds because the lawyers take

870
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:19,090
a third,
so it's a fucking scam.

871
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,460
He was.
He was just like,

872
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,240
oh my God.

873
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,190
Rabid about it.
It was,

874
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,130
oh my God,
I didn't think of that.

875
00:37:24,131 --> 00:37:24,761
I was like,
Oh yeah,

876
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:26,440
the lawyers,
because they do.

877
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,550
They don't work for free.
You're not paying for your wife's lawyer

878
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:33,220
to fuck face.
You pay for both of them are brutal.

879
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,170
You pay for the the general of the army 
that's fighting against you.

880
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,033
You pay for that.
General General is trying to rob you of 

881
00:37:41,591 --> 00:37:42,750
your resources.
Yeah,

882
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,760
and your checks and you've been selling 
out arenas your whole life and they want

883
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,030
most of that.
They want the house that you sleep in on

884
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,470
everything they want.
They want to take away memories.

885
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:01,980
They want to steal the very foundation 
of your happiness and prosperity.

886
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:07,210
Could Joe Rogan Joe Rogan have 
everything go away?

887
00:38:09,351 --> 00:38:10,760
Your kids are fine.
You your relationships,

888
00:38:10,761 --> 00:38:11,360
cool.
Whatever.

889
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,120
Let's take that element out of it.
Let's just take the house,

890
00:38:14,121 --> 00:38:16,130
the cash,
the bows and arrows.

891
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:21,700
It's all gone.
Could Joe Rogan go live in?

892
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,930
Let's just pick New York.
This is not a silly question,

893
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:25,943
but let's pick New York.
Could you go live down by Washington 

894
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,690
Square Park in a studio,
apartment,

895
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,040
Heavier Act.
Have your fans go do your thing and kind

896
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:36,040
of be okay with a low bank account or

897
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,700
have you got.
Are you at an age now and you've,

898
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:39,983
you've had stability.
Do you feel like that would freak you 

899
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:43,270
out?
Well,

900
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:46,510
it would definitely freak you out if you
all the sudden,

901
00:38:46,511 --> 00:38:51,511
like one of the things that I've sort of
relied on is not needing anything.

902
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,820
Right?
So by not needing anything,

903
00:38:54,821 --> 00:38:56,920
everything I do,
I do because I enjoy it.

904
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,260
Right.
So like if I do stand up I do it because

905
00:38:59,261 --> 00:39:00,094
I enjoy it and if I do podcasts because 
I enjoy it if I do the UFC is because I 

906
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:05,660
enjoyed.
I enjoyed the money is done.

907
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,870
Don't get me wrong.
Sure.

908
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,280
But I'm not,
I'm not needy.

909
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,173
I'm not in a position where I'm like 
worried about my next check so that 

910
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:14,290
stuff.
So if I got to that.

911
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:14,840
Yeah.
No,

912
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,673
not even need that stuff.
Like neither stuff is kind of like if 

913
00:39:18,761 --> 00:39:19,594
you have a car and you can get around,
you've got food on the table and your 

914
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:23,230
family's taken care of.

915
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,650
Everything else is kind of bullshit.
It's nice.

916
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,420
It's nice to have a good couch.
Like,

917
00:39:28,421 --> 00:39:30,280
look,
we have a 70 inch TV.

918
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,930
Ooh,
this is nice.

919
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,530
It feels nice.
But Watch westworld and a 70 inch TV.

920
00:39:35,531 --> 00:39:36,940
It's nice.
Look how big it is.

921
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:37,774
Woo.
Yeah.

922
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:41,890
But ultimately what really counts is,
are you nervous?

923
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,790
Are you nervous about your bills?
Because like,

924
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,940
do you remember that feeling?
Yeah,

925
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,290
that sounds terrible.
Feeling worried about where that's gonna

926
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,740
come from and what you're going to do,
but you still have your act.

927
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:54,603
You can still go make money,
but we're going to put you back at 

928
00:39:56,741 --> 00:39:57,574
square one.
We're going to put you in that studio 

929
00:39:58,661 --> 00:39:59,494
apartment.
Could you,

930
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:00,603
would you be cool with it?
Studios kind of small one like a four 

931
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,730
bedroom house with a yard and some 
working.

932
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,950
No,
but honestly the big thing,

933
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:09,784
and this is such a cliche,
but the big thing is do I still have my 

934
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:12,754
friends?

935
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,163
Do I still have the same friends?
Because if I lived in an apartment 

936
00:40:16,391 --> 00:40:17,224
building and Ari Shaffir lived next door
and Duncan lived down the hallway and 

937
00:40:20,081 --> 00:40:22,270
joey was over the other side.
Yeah,

938
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,570
I don't have a great time.
Yeah.

939
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,140
We all lived on the same floor,
the same building.

940
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:28,480
I would have zero problem with that if 
they knocked on the door.

941
00:40:28,481 --> 00:40:29,291
Hey man,
you got any weed?

942
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:30,740
I'm going to wait.
Come on know.

943
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:33,160
Exactly.
That would be no problem at all.

944
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:33,994
It's like how much different is that 
than when you stay on the road in the 

945
00:40:35,921 --> 00:40:36,754
hotel?
Because the hotel is like a studio 

946
00:40:38,111 --> 00:40:38,944
apartment.
Yeah,

947
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,380
and you're right.
Good percentage of our lives.

948
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,800
We stay in a studio apartment a lot.
I know that.

949
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:44,740
I really,
I,

950
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:48,070
I bring it up because I really.
I was thinking about it and it's like if

951
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:48,904
it all fell apart like you grew up,
you grab on to your lifestyle and what 

952
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:56,140
you're doing so hard,
but if at all for whatever reason washed

953
00:40:56,141 --> 00:40:59,740
away and you still go perform and you 
still had your friends at this club,

954
00:40:59,741 --> 00:41:01,800
you could see what it.
It's,

955
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,730
it's.
I could totally do it.

956
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:08,940
I could totally go back to I have 
clothes that fit in this big of a closet

957
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,330
and just and just keep doing what I'm 
doing,

958
00:41:13,331 --> 00:41:15,820
but in those circumstances I 100 
percent.

959
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:19,210
In some ways I think your.
You'd be lighter.

960
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,110
You'd be right.
A lot of people do believe that in a lot

961
00:41:23,111 --> 00:41:26,350
of people do go towards that minimalism 
life where they give up everything.

962
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,810
My friend Steve Maxwell,
he's a,

963
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:31,690
a really a world renowned fitness 
trainer,

964
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,160
strength and conditioning coach for a 
lot of pro

965
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,210
athletes,
a lot of fighters.

966
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,190
He lives out of a duffle bag.

967
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,790
Oh,
I saw that guy.

968
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,670
So you interviewed?
Yeah.

969
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,130
Uh,
he,

970
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:40,963
he used to have a big house and he had a
gym in Philadelphia you'd like one of 

971
00:41:44,651 --> 00:41:45,484
the very,
he's one of the very first American 

972
00:41:46,511 --> 00:41:47,344
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt and he 
had this gigantic jam where he's 

973
00:41:50,051 --> 00:41:51,870
teaching and he said,
you know,

974
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:52,893
he's an interesting guy.
And then he just decided he got 

975
00:41:54,191 --> 00:41:55,170
divorced,
right.

976
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,440
And he decided,
you know what,

977
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,210
fuck this.
He goes,

978
00:41:58,211 --> 00:41:59,044
I'm going to live out of a van.
And he got like a camper van and he 

979
00:42:02,261 --> 00:42:04,120
lived out of that and he's like,
fuck this van.

980
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:04,983
I'm getting,
I'm just going to keep traveling really 

981
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,870
now.
He just stays in hotels everywhere.

982
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,000
That's amazing.
And that's what brings it up.

983
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:12,000
It's the divorce.
I see.

984
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:15,110
I don't think,
I don't think willingly I would do it,

985
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:17,600
but if something was thrust upon,
like if you got divorced,

986
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:21,010
divorce or some something,
I would uh,

987
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,270
I could go back,
I could be like,

988
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,293
do,
but you're thinking about it so much 

989
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:27,180
that you brought it up as a subject,
but this is something you wonder.

990
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,440
Uh,
yeah.

991
00:42:29,441 --> 00:42:32,590
Not as far as the divorce part of it,
but just the simple life.

992
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,453
Yeah,
because I've built a life that's bigger 

993
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,530
and more complicated and I,
uh,

994
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,600
you want to know what you want to know 
what it was.

995
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:42,603
Last time I was in here,
I had had this back issue where it was 

996
00:42:45,011 --> 00:42:47,330
like shooting pain down my arm.
Yeah.

997
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,580
You had a cervical issue,
right?

998
00:42:48,581 --> 00:42:49,414
Yeah,
and I was going to this really great 

999
00:42:51,251 --> 00:42:52,870
Cairo guy.
I was doing cupping,

1000
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:56,110
I was doing all of this kind of stuff 
and it was just making it worse.

1001
00:42:56,111 --> 00:42:57,970
I was just in words.
Oh yeah.

1002
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,550
I was in,
I was in pain for like a year.

1003
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,790
I was like in pain.
Gregg Rogell,

1004
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:04,624
you know,
the comedian he tells me he had really 

1005
00:43:07,031 --> 00:43:12,031
developed debilitating lower back pain 
and he read some book I Read,

1006
00:43:12,731 --> 00:43:13,331
sorry.
He's like,

1007
00:43:13,331 --> 00:43:15,900
just read it and I got into this big 
fight with him and,

1008
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:18,320
and uh,
and uh,

1009
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,173
know him who owns the comedy cellar,
he's calling them a crack and it's a 

1010
00:43:22,061 --> 00:43:24,280
crackpot and it doesn't work and all 
this stuff.

1011
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,680
And Greg is like,
just please read it,

1012
00:43:26,681 --> 00:43:27,880
just read it,
just read it.

1013
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:28,991
And it's,
you know,

1014
00:43:28,991 --> 00:43:29,824
what it is.
It's just basically about that you're 

1015
00:43:30,551 --> 00:43:31,384
carrying your brain wants to go to work 
on something simple like pain in your 

1016
00:43:35,231 --> 00:43:36,064
body rather than deal with issues of 
stress and anxiety and anger that you 

1017
00:43:40,331 --> 00:43:41,164
carry all the time and basically just 
realizing that that's where the pain is 

1018
00:43:44,471 --> 00:43:45,304
coming from.
Don't have to solve the anxiety or the 

1019
00:43:47,261 --> 00:43:50,710
pain or the anger.
You just have to be aware of,

1020
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:51,701
okay,
brain,

1021
00:43:51,701 --> 00:43:53,950
I know what you're doing,
I know what you're working on.

1022
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,593
It just kind of alleviates that stress.
And then the physical manifestation of 

1023
00:43:59,381 --> 00:44:00,214
not having oxygen go into your,
into your muscles and stuff starts to 

1024
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:08,050
slowly release and just it.
It's gone.

1025
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:09,700
It's gone.
It's.

1026
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:11,530
I have no pain.
I have no.

1027
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:14,440
How long did it take after you read the 
book and adopted the principles?

1028
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,330
Like a month and a half.
Really?

1029
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:19,210
Yeah.
So a year of pain and then a month and a

1030
00:44:19,211 --> 00:44:21,670
half of adopting these principles.
And what does he tell you to do?

1031
00:44:21,671 --> 00:44:23,770
Like what are the exercises that he 
tells you to do?

1032
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,440
He says,
just live.

1033
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:29,260
Don't just a live your life exercise.
Whatever you were doing,

1034
00:44:29,261 --> 00:44:31,090
do it.
Don't live timidly.

1035
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,243
Think I can't run now.
I can't do yoga now because I've got a 

1036
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:37,290
neck issue.
Do it live your life.

1037
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,153
Don't live like in this preventative way
of I can't move or I'm going to mess up 

1038
00:44:41,551 --> 00:44:42,750
my,
my body.

1039
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,590
So what does he tell you about?
Like physical issues.

1040
00:44:45,591 --> 00:44:49,040
Like what if you have a herniated disc 
and it's pressing against your nerve and

1041
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:51,740
it's causing your hands to go numb and 
your arms atrophying.

1042
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,070
He says there's.
Those are very rare cases.

1043
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:56,500
It's not that rare in my world.
I know.

1044
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,131
Well,
yeah,

1045
00:44:57,131 --> 00:44:58,480
you're right,
but he said,

1046
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:59,343
he says it's very rare cases where 
there's like a real pinched nerve kind 

1047
00:45:03,281 --> 00:45:04,114
of a problem.

1048
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,513
It seems like crazy advice.
I know a lot of people that have like 

1049
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:10,200
real issues,
like real physical issues.

1050
00:45:10,201 --> 00:45:14,040
It's not a rare thing to have.
Like disc issues are gigantic.

1051
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,690
Yeah,
because people,

1052
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:17,400
they don't strengthen their spine 
enough.

1053
00:45:17,401 --> 00:45:20,490
They don't drink near core enough and 
they wind up doing something.

1054
00:45:20,491 --> 00:45:21,720
They Yank it,
they heard it,

1055
00:45:21,721 --> 00:45:23,820
and then they try to work around it and 
they wanted to Rehab,

1056
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:25,830
aggravating it,
and then it gets worse and worse.

1057
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,750
You were saying that a lot of times 
you'll have,

1058
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:30,543
you'll have like your disk will be 
bulging a little bit or whatever these 

1059
00:45:33,821 --> 00:45:38,230
little imperfections are and we all have
these imperfections in us,

1060
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:39,663
but when you are stressed and the 
muscles are tightening around you and 

1061
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:43,683
becoming inflamed because you're 
carrying this stuff that you're not 

1062
00:45:46,331 --> 00:45:48,850
working through,
everything's constricting around it,

1063
00:45:48,851 --> 00:45:52,090
so then it's going to aggravate that and
that's going to become a bigger problem.

1064
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:55,760
I definitely think that's true in some 
cases,

1065
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,193
but there's like there's legitimate,
like I had a conversation with a friend 

1066
00:45:59,121 --> 00:46:02,450
of mine about this with the same sort of
a thing and I was like that.

1067
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,510
That's all well and good,
but I know people who are very light and

1068
00:46:05,511 --> 00:46:09,260
happy people who develop a legitimate 
back issue and it has nothing to do with

1069
00:46:09,261 --> 00:46:10,094
stress that they're carrying around.
It has to do with the soft tissue that 

1070
00:46:13,401 --> 00:46:18,401
protects your joints,
bulging out and contacting a nerve.

1071
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,273
Look.
There's a zillion of us out there and 

1072
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,660
I'm sure there's all different issues 
for it,

1073
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:26,063
but back to your original question of 
why am I thinking about simplifying and 

1074
00:46:28,561 --> 00:46:33,561
all this kind of stuff.
I am a pretty light positive person,

1075
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,370
very optimistic,
very.

1076
00:46:35,371 --> 00:46:36,204
I kind of live in that world,
but when I just started reading the 

1077
00:46:39,481 --> 00:46:39,901
book,
I'm like,

1078
00:46:39,901 --> 00:46:42,240
are things really pissing me off?
Am I stressed?

1079
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,133
Do I have anxiety because I live in this
house because I'm trying to do these 

1080
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:46,374
things with my career because I'm trying
to always do this because I'm carrying 

1081
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:52,560
children and parents and all of this 
stuff.

1082
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,990
I'm trying to make everybody happy.
I'm just,

1083
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:55,943
I don't know,
maybe just realizing that and thinking 

1084
00:46:58,411 --> 00:47:01,110
about it.
I'm in no heavy meditation on it.

1085
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:03,690
No,
just being aware that maybe that's where

1086
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:04,524
it's coming from.
I'm telling you over a month and a half 

1087
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,950
the pain slowly went away and I don't 
have it.

1088
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:12,450
Hm.
Yeah.

1089
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,570
That is interesting.
So what,

1090
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:19,640
what was bothering you before?
Like I know that you're,

1091
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:20,653
you know,
you're successful and you had a 

1092
00:47:21,841 --> 00:47:25,380
television show for awhile and you've 
got a bunch of projects going on.

1093
00:47:25,381 --> 00:47:27,720
You're always doing standup and 
specials,

1094
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:28,643
so you have had a lot of success.
You've got a lot of great stuff going 

1095
00:47:30,821 --> 00:47:31,960
on.
What was,

1096
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,880
what was kind of chewing at you?

1097
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,313
I don't know.
I'm not really 100 percent sure of what 

1098
00:47:37,631 --> 00:47:38,464
the sources,
but I do feel like I have a lot of 

1099
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:46,540
people on my back and it's all,
it's all quiet.

1100
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:48,580
It's all in my head.
You know what I mean?

1101
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:50,260
A lot of people on your back.
Yeah.

1102
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:51,950
I've got a wife.
I've got,

1103
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,700
I've got kids,
I've got pets,

1104
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,040
I've got family.
I've got

1105
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:00,360
in the end that you feel that was a 
weird,

1106
00:48:00,361 --> 00:48:01,880
a weird way to bring,
bring,

1107
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,100
bring this up,
but is that,

1108
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:07,520
how much of that,
like having a wife and having kids,

1109
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:08,413
obviously there's going to be 
compromises and there's going to be 

1110
00:48:11,691 --> 00:48:13,820
stressed that comes along with any sort 
of relationship,

1111
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:15,403
but do you feel like it was tipping more
towards the negative than towards the 

1112
00:48:19,221 --> 00:48:20,054
positive?

1113
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:22,920
Um,
I don't think it was.

1114
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,080
I think I just,
uh,

1115
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:28,680
the whole experience to me seems 
positive.

1116
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,690
My relationship with my wife is great.
The kids I adore,

1117
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:38,840
I feel like it's all positive,
but I do carry the burden of everybody's

1118
00:48:39,091 --> 00:48:41,220
worries and everybody's wellbeing all 
the time.

1119
00:48:41,221 --> 00:48:42,054
I was working on this axis,
this joke in my act before I started 

1120
00:48:44,071 --> 00:48:44,904
thinking about all this stuff I had this
moment where I was standing in this 

1121
00:48:47,671 --> 00:48:49,320
house.
I moved to this bigger house.

1122
00:48:49,321 --> 00:48:50,154
It's a really nice house to bigger,
bigger home and I was shutting off all 

1123
00:48:54,211 --> 00:48:55,044
the lights is what I was working through
onstage and I was turning off all the 

1124
00:48:57,661 --> 00:48:58,494
lights one night and locking the doors 
for all the bad people that are coming 

1125
00:49:00,811 --> 00:49:01,644
to get us and everyone's in their beds 
and the cat's asleep and the dog's 

1126
00:49:04,321 --> 00:49:07,560
asleep and everybody the lizard to sleep
and it just,

1127
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:10,170
all my responsibility washed over me.

1128
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:15,360
Like everybody,
every living thing here is,

1129
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,040
is,
uh,

1130
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,790
depending on my success.
If I don't keep going,

1131
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:21,624
if I don't keep succeeding this,
everything here changes everybody's 

1132
00:49:25,501 --> 00:49:28,320
little life.
Everybody's perfect little existence.

1133
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:32,490
It's all washing over me and I can't 
tell anyone about it.

1134
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,353
I can tell you the audience,
but I can't go sit on my daughter's bed 

1135
00:49:35,491 --> 00:49:37,070
at two in the morning when I have that 
feeling.

1136
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:38,483
Honey temper.
Do you ever feel like he just can't do 

1137
00:49:41,131 --> 00:49:43,650
it anymore?
You ever feel like he can't,

1138
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,040
he just want to stop.
He just wanted to take a break.

1139
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:50,190
This whole thing about waking up my 
daughter with my fears.

1140
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,860
I can't do that.
I don't tell my wife that stuff.

1141
00:49:52,861 --> 00:49:54,900
I don't tell my kids that.
I just carry it.

1142
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:58,140
So when I started reading this book I'm 
like,

1143
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:02,040
maybe I'm just taking all this really 
seriously and feeling like

1144
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:06,640
extended with the new home.
Is that it?

1145
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:07,493
Because a lot of times I have a friend 
of mine who did that recently bought a 

1146
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:13,330
big place and he can afford it,
but kind of.

1147
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:14,021
Right.
You know,

1148
00:50:14,021 --> 00:50:14,854
it's like,
okay,

1149
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:17,860
think about this.
Now I'm a.

1150
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:18,783
I'm a big advocate and never doing that.
I don't think you should ever buy a big 

1151
00:50:22,331 --> 00:50:23,620
place unless you're like,
hey,

1152
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:25,600
we can get a nice place now.
I'm not even think about it.

1153
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:26,311
Let's.
No,

1154
00:50:26,311 --> 00:50:27,950
we're totally.
We can do it.

1155
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:28,933
And it seemed to be.
I hadn't really small place for a long 

1156
00:50:30,591 --> 00:50:32,690
time and did all the right things,
so it's.

1157
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,260
The outlay is no different from my 
little place before.

1158
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:37,603
It's all cool,
but when you walk into a place like 

1159
00:50:40,131 --> 00:50:41,930
that,
it just feels bigger.

1160
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:44,420
It just ain't no.
The first time I bought a home ever,

1161
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:46,970
I had this little place in studio city.
It's a little,

1162
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:47,801
you know,
I just,

1163
00:50:47,801 --> 00:50:51,380
I remember laying on the couch like,
hi,

1164
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,214
I don't know if I can do this.
I've got to sign this paper and every 

1165
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:56,643
say years is a long back,
and every time the mail came for the 

1166
00:50:59,061 --> 00:51:01,730
first year that I owned a home,
I thought it was going to be noticing.

1167
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:03,980
You've got to get out of there now,
if you know what I mean.

1168
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:07,280
I just was fearful about it.
Mortgages are weird,

1169
00:51:07,281 --> 00:51:08,270
man.
It's like you.

1170
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,850
Here's a bill for 30 years,
right?

1171
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:12,020
Yeah.
That's heavy.

1172
00:51:12,021 --> 00:51:13,250
That weighs on you.
Yeah.

1173
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,390
So that's what it just brought me to the
feeling of like,

1174
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,253
well maybe just going back and living 
with my wife in that little studio 

1175
00:51:22,431 --> 00:51:25,100
apartment in New York again,
wouldn't be so bad.

1176
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:26,510
Kid's a freak out.
It would be.

1177
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,490
The kids would free kids would hate it.
The kids would have to be gone,

1178
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,300
dad,
you need to be more successful.

1179
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:37,760
Take your pressure like a man.
What'd you downsize?

1180
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,100
Who cares if your next crooked of a 
bitch?

1181
00:51:40,101 --> 00:51:43,400
Who cares if your arms go numb?
I want to go to Berkeley.

1182
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,580
Everything's clean your teeth,
so I don't know.

1183
00:51:46,581 --> 00:51:51,350
I mean because it's a little self-aware 
moment because I do,

1184
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,213
like I said,
I'm.

1185
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:57,050
I feel like I'm pretty carefree,
but why the hell am was my neck so

1186
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:59,470
well,
I think in stuff that was something that

1187
00:51:59,471 --> 00:52:00,304
resonated with Sarano,
his book and I remember a Howard stern 

1188
00:52:02,171 --> 00:52:03,210
talking about it.
Yeah,

1189
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:07,510
he had a similar situation.
I definitely think people carry a lot of

1190
00:52:07,511 --> 00:52:11,950
tension and then that tension sort of 
manifested itself in physical pain,

1191
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:13,173
but what I do is I do difficult things.
I like to do difficult things that are 

1192
00:52:18,011 --> 00:52:18,844
way more difficult than comedy.
So if I'm doing Jujitsu or from 

1193
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:25,270
bowhunting for some of the workouts that
I do,

1194
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:30,300
there's so much harder than,
than anything like out just yoga class.

1195
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:35,050
Just a fucking 90 minute beak from Yoga 
class in 140 degrees.

1196
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:38,710
When you're going 100 percent,
I put 100 percent effort to every pose.

1197
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,150
Like fucking pouring sweat.
It's difficult when you do that.

1198
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:45,100
It seems to me,
at least in my,

1199
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:48,550
with my fucked up brain,
that other stuff doesn't bother me.

1200
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:50,110
It's not,
you're fucked up brain.

1201
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:55,270
I equate this anxiety to stopping yoga.
I did yoga for,

1202
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,153
I dunno,
eight years and I haven't done it in 

1203
00:52:59,661 --> 00:53:01,130
three.
I'll get back in there,

1204
00:53:01,131 --> 00:53:02,510
man.
And I'm telling you,

1205
00:53:02,511 --> 00:53:04,580
I used to walk around like the biggest 
advocate.

1206
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:05,660
I'm like no.
Once I started,

1207
00:53:05,661 --> 00:53:07,100
you know,
stress here,

1208
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:08,770
no pain here.
So everything.

1209
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,600
But when you started giving those pains,
why didn't you just get back in?

1210
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:17,080
I don't know.
I'll tell you what do I have no idea?

1211
00:53:17,571 --> 00:53:18,404
I don't know what the real answer is,
but in my head it's the classes from 

1212
00:53:20,601 --> 00:53:21,434
nine till 10:30
and that's when I do my best writing 

1213
00:53:23,481 --> 00:53:25,590
when the kids get out of the house and I
can write in the morning.

1214
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:26,200
Oh,

1215
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,033
okay.
That was,

1216
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,510
that was my,
that's my lame ass excuse.

1217
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,880
You just gotTa Force Yourself.
Yeah,

1218
00:53:32,881 --> 00:53:35,310
I forced myself just try and write some 
other time.

1219
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:37,560
You sit down and you don't sit down and 
write,

1220
00:53:37,561 --> 00:53:38,910
write like you don't.
Oh yeah,

1221
00:53:38,911 --> 00:53:39,690
I do.
You do?

1222
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:42,000
Oh yeah.
I thought you were a stage guy.

1223
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:43,110
No,
no.

1224
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:44,550
I'm a stage guy too.
Yeah.

1225
00:53:44,551 --> 00:53:47,220
Well I'm A.
I'm a firm believer like martial arts,

1226
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,113
I think that you need to do.
I think you like if you wanted to be a 

1227
00:53:50,911 --> 00:53:53,040
mixed martial artist and he only wanted 
to work on your skill,

1228
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:54,420
I think you're doing yourself a 
disservice.

1229
00:53:54,421 --> 00:53:56,160
I think you need to do strength and 
conditioning as well.

1230
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:59,120
I think you need to do drills as well.
Spar,

1231
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,353
I think comedy is the same way.
I think writing on stage and I think 

1232
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,570
there's a bunch of aspects that have 
over the last few years.

1233
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:10,050
I like to think that I've kind of got my
own way of doing it.

1234
00:54:10,051 --> 00:54:10,884
Everybody's got a different way.
Obviously everyone's got a different 

1235
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:15,480
style.
My own way though is a bunch of things.

1236
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,400
One,
socialization.

1237
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,860
I need to socialize.
Yeah.

1238
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:19,733
I need to go out with friends.
I need to go have a drink or smoke some 

1239
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:25,950
pot with my buddies and we start 
laughing and goofing around about things

1240
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:26,803
or meet new people.
Talk to some interesting person like 

1241
00:54:29,521 --> 00:54:30,354
this.
One of the things that I really like 

1242
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:33,120
about podcasts is to get to talk to 
interesting,

1243
00:54:33,121 --> 00:54:33,954
cool people that kind of socializing 
leads to new pathways of ideas get 

1244
00:54:38,731 --> 00:54:40,590
expanded.
What made you think,

1245
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:41,980
did you think of that are just 
happening?

1246
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,510
You look back like I remember thinking 
somewhere along the line,

1247
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,373
God,
I come up with a lot of great ideas for 

1248
00:54:47,461 --> 00:54:48,294
bits when I'm having fun with people 
having fun with friends or even with 

1249
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:53,370
people I don't even know if they're 
like,

1250
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:56,160
you know the occasionally you'll meet 
someone that's really cool,

1251
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:59,490
you enjoy talking to them and then you 
have these cool conversations.

1252
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:00,323
You see this perspective from a stranger
that's interesting and they say 

1253
00:55:03,151 --> 00:55:05,910
something and then it fires something in
your own brain.

1254
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:10,290
I think socializing is big and I think 
that's one of the reasons why really,

1255
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:11,124
really famous comedians hit a dead spot 
later in their career because they're 

1256
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:20,500
circle becomes very small because they 
only trust certain people and they.

1257
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:21,563
They kind of get anxiety about hanging 
out with regular folks and just going 

1258
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:25,981
out there.
Yeah,

1259
00:55:25,981 --> 00:55:28,350
they get isolated.
They drive limos everywhere.

1260
00:55:28,351 --> 00:55:30,510
They live in a mansion and they never 
get to meet anybody.

1261
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:33,240
Yeah,
so socialization is big.

1262
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:36,120
Activity is big.
I need to do things you need to do.

1263
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,310
I need to go places.
I need to see things.

1264
00:55:38,311 --> 00:55:39,990
I need to travel,
I need to.

1265
00:55:39,991 --> 00:55:42,930
I'm like,
I do a lot of different things.

1266
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,450
I like to try to get as much activity as
possible,

1267
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:49,200
but physical writing to me is a must.

1268
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,720
I sit down in front of my computer and I
write.

1269
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,930
I write all the time and I don't 
necessarily write jokes.

1270
00:55:54,931 --> 00:55:56,040
I just write,
write,

1271
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:00,240
and then the jokes come out of that 
premise has come out of that stuff.

1272
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,610
I'm more essays.
I love that.

1273
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:03,593
That's one of my favorite parts of 
standup is just being by myself and 

1274
00:56:06,511 --> 00:56:08,190
writing.
Just that part,

1275
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:10,550
that mining,
you know,

1276
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:12,060
you're just mining.
Exactly.

1277
00:56:12,061 --> 00:56:14,460
And then once in awhile you get this 
great stuff that comes out.

1278
00:56:14,461 --> 00:56:15,294
A lot of times nothing comes out.
That's the biggest challenge of writing 

1279
00:56:17,071 --> 00:56:21,120
is getting out of your way and not 
beating yourself up.

1280
00:56:21,121 --> 00:56:22,850
If everything that comes out isn't 
great.

1281
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,100
Yup.
Most of it isn't

1282
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,110
great.
I think one of the biggest challenges of

1283
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:26,944
writing is discipline.
That's one of the biggest challenges 

1284
00:56:29,081 --> 00:56:29,914
because most people just don't know if 
you're a writer of your comic and 

1285
00:56:33,581 --> 00:56:34,414
someone does no one telling you you have
to do it because you have this open 

1286
00:56:38,811 --> 00:56:41,230
ended schedule.
Like you could have gone to yoga.

1287
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,610
Yeah.
From nine to 10:30

1288
00:56:42,611 --> 00:56:43,444
and he chose to write like you and you 
might have chosen to write because yoga 

1289
00:56:46,151 --> 00:56:47,520
is too hard.
You might've decided,

1290
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,510
you know,
writing is too difficult.

1291
00:56:49,511 --> 00:56:51,730
I'm just going to.
Or Yoga is too difficult.

1292
00:56:51,731 --> 00:56:52,420
I'm just kidding.
Right.

1293
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,370
I mean it could be one of one of,
you know,

1294
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,400
either reasons.
Yeah,

1295
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:59,360
it's a no,
it,

1296
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,790
I should do both.
I should.

1297
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,300
You said,
you know,

1298
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:04,930
I,
I always try with writing also to not be

1299
00:57:04,931 --> 00:57:05,764
so rigid.
Like there was a time when I could only 

1300
00:57:08,441 --> 00:57:09,274
write on the computer in the morning up 
until 10 and it's like that's stupid 

1301
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:16,570
because sometimes I don't have my 
computer.

1302
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:21,570
Sometimes I just have a pad and I'm in a
coffee house after doing radio at 11,

1303
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:22,773
so why not do that?
So my thing now is I just make myself 

1304
00:57:25,961 --> 00:57:29,470
sit down for two hours at some point,
whatever.

1305
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:31,040
It doesn't matter if it's late in the 
day,

1306
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,020
night,
whatever it is.

1307
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,170
That's like your workout.
It's like you've got to sit.

1308
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,060
Just sit.
Do you ever read on your phone?

1309
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,253
Yeah.
You know what's amazing about riding on 

1310
00:57:39,461 --> 00:57:41,980
the phone?
If you have an iphone or even.

1311
00:57:41,981 --> 00:57:44,320
There's actually a lot of them now.
Use notes.

1312
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:46,150
Yeah.
Notes and um,

1313
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,970
and then dictated.
Oh yeah.

1314
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,950
Is it accurate?
Super accurate.

1315
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:51,671
Really?
Yeah.

1316
00:57:51,671 --> 00:57:54,340
You never tried it like that.
I'll show you right here.

1317
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,860
So right here,
press that button right there.

1318
00:57:56,861 --> 00:57:57,694
This is the iphone.
I've got an interesting story about 

1319
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,670
this.
Are you writing notes?

1320
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:00,251
Go off.
Yeah,

1321
00:58:00,251 --> 00:58:00,671
that's it.
No,

1322
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:02,170
it's a press.
The voice thing.

1323
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:04,900
Tom.
Papa is a bad motherfucker.

1324
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,190
Bam.
Wow.

1325
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:08,900
Amazing.
Right?

1326
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,100
It's so true.
This dude,

1327
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:15,090
he writes in the morning when he's 
supposed to be taken yoga,

1328
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,550
his next all fucked up and he doesn't 
know why,

1329
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:21,860
but he's a good guy and he's hilarious.
Go see him this Friday on Epix.

1330
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:23,270
Thanks Joe.
Man.

1331
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,510
Hilarious.
Yeah,

1332
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:28,800
it's all right.
It's not perfect.

1333
00:58:28,801 --> 00:58:30,060
No,
but that's pretty good.

1334
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:31,810
Meanwhile,
what the fuck is hilarious.

1335
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:32,820
Hey.
No,

1336
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:34,030
that's a pretty bad.
Was worse.

1337
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:35,460
It keeps.
It keeps dictating.

1338
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,290
It still talking.
It's getting this whole.

1339
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,950
It just said what the fuck is hilarious.
Do you do that when you're driving?

1340
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,170
Yes.
That's how I do text if I have to.

1341
00:58:43,171 --> 00:58:44,880
If I'm driving.
I try not to do that though.

1342
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:45,983
What I do when I'm driving,
this is a big one for me is I've turned 

1343
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:50,940
the phone upside down and I put it over 
there.

1344
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:52,740
I don't have a near me when you're 
driving.

1345
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:53,963
It's too creepy.
It's like too many people are fucking 

1346
00:58:55,861 --> 00:58:58,200
driving and not paying attention and 
they crash into each other.

1347
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,270
I know it's the worst.
It's way too common.

1348
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,280
So bad.
I fucking.

1349
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:05,850
Every time I'm on the road and I see 
someone weaving in and out of traffic,

1350
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:06,863
I see the light of their phones in their
eyes and they try to text while they're 

1351
00:59:09,901 --> 00:59:11,310
driving.
It's so dangerous.

1352
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,450
I know.
I know.

1353
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:15,840
My daughter is.
My oldest one is 14,

1354
00:59:15,841 --> 00:59:18,690
which means she can get a permit next 
year,

1355
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,290
like 15 and a half that she text.

1356
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:24,200
She's not crazy.
She's,

1357
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:25,034
you know,
she's like a normal kid but she's not 

1358
00:59:26,551 --> 00:59:29,030
like really obsessed with it,
but I just,

1359
00:59:29,031 --> 00:59:31,790
it scares the hell out of me once they 
start getting one little chips.

1360
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:34,910
Yeah.
One nuts when things get so yes.

1361
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:35,773
So crazy fucking.
Although the energy involved in 

1362
00:59:39,741 --> 00:59:42,350
relationships for young kids,
you might get on kid.

1363
00:59:42,351 --> 00:59:47,210
They go from being 11 where hopefully 
there's no fucking at all.

1364
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,193
Yeah.
Two 15 where that's all you're thinking 

1365
00:59:50,751 --> 00:59:51,740
of.
Yeah.

1366
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,990
Just in you know,
40 something months

1367
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,320
and then.
And then he doesn't call.

1368
00:59:57,321 --> 00:59:58,154
You are likely aware there's a problem 
and you're waiting and you're checking 

1369
01:00:00,411 --> 01:00:01,244
your phone every two seconds to see the 
response and now you're driving to go 

1370
01:00:05,271 --> 01:00:10,271
pick up milk for your mom and you hear a
ding and you reach over to check it.

1371
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:11,240
Boom.
Hit a tree.

1372
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,770
I can't.
Yeah.

1373
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,820
My neck just started hurting again.
Oh,

1374
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,630
the arms now.
Massive,

1375
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:21,650
massive fucking hormones raging through 
your body,

1376
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:24,470
telling you to get pregnant,
telling you to get someone pregnant.

1377
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:27,140
Could you imagine if we had phones when 
we were going through puberty?

1378
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:29,810
Could you imagine all the Dick Pics that
you would have?

1379
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,830
Oh my.
You wait.

1380
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:31,693
The begging,
the begging of girls to show me 

1381
01:00:33,561 --> 01:00:37,800
something.
Do something please.

1382
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:40,610
My God,
he'd be out of.

1383
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:43,910
I don't know,
but on the other hand,

1384
01:00:43,911 --> 01:00:45,740
you'd be wiser.
Yeah,

1385
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:47,810
because you'd be able to google things.
I mean,

1386
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:50,120
how many bullshitters did we know 
growing up?

1387
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:53,540
It just would lie and make stories up.
Oh my God.

1388
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:55,370
Yeah.
Those people were out of business,

1389
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:57,923
but not necessarily.
Have you been paying attention to fake 

1390
01:00:59,851 --> 01:01:01,080
news?
Yeah,

1391
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,140
big time of fake news stories.
A big time.

1392
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,033
It's crazy.
Like I didn't realize until this pizza 

1393
01:01:07,381 --> 01:01:09,180
gate thing,
which by the way,

1394
01:01:09,181 --> 01:01:10,014
it's a very controversial,
what's fake and what's not fake about 

1395
01:01:12,331 --> 01:01:15,810
pizza gate because pizza gate is 
connected to that.

1396
01:01:15,811 --> 01:01:16,644
John Podesta Guy who is a very 
controversial character who still 

1397
01:01:21,301 --> 01:01:22,134
friends with that Dennis Hastert Guy who
was the speaker of the house who's 

1398
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,380
absolutely a pedophile.
Yeah,

1399
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:32,340
absolutely.
A confirmed serial pedophile admitted,

1400
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,140
admitted,
admitted.

1401
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:36,840
So the fact that that guy is friends 
with that.

1402
01:01:36,841 --> 01:01:37,674
And then also Andrew Breitbart 
apparently in 2011 was made a tweet 

1403
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:48,890
about Podesta being a guy who helps 
people who fuck kids.

1404
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,970
Yeah.
And it was like he made this crazy tweet

1405
01:01:53,971 --> 01:01:54,804
about him in 2011,
which five years later after Breitbart 

1406
01:01:57,901 --> 01:01:59,180
is dead.
It's a.

1407
01:01:59,181 --> 01:02:01,350
it's a very interesting to read that 
tweet and say,

1408
01:02:01,351 --> 01:02:02,184
well,
what did he know about Podesta before 

1409
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:04,613
all this spirit cooking and all this 
craziness came out with the Hillary 

1410
01:02:08,281 --> 01:02:09,114
campaign.

1411
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:12,090
He fucking knew something,
you know?

1412
01:02:12,091 --> 01:02:14,670
And this was.
Yeah,

1413
01:02:14,671 --> 01:02:15,121
like,
pull up,

1414
01:02:15,121 --> 01:02:17,310
pull up the tweet.
This is from 2011.

1415
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,380
How Prague,
Prague,

1416
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:20,214
like Progressive Guru John Podesta isn't
household name as world class underage 

1417
01:02:24,771 --> 01:02:26,790
sex,
slave op cover,

1418
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:30,720
upper defending,
unspeakable dregs escapes me.

1419
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:31,733
Now.
This was of course when hastert was 

1420
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:35,063
about to get convicted,
so he's been friends with hastert 

1421
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:40,170
forever.
Has stirred by the way,

1422
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:45,380
was the fucking speaker of the house and
he had been fucking kids for years.

1423
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:48,443
So anybody who doesn't think that it can
reach you could be a pedophile and 

1424
01:02:51,451 --> 01:02:53,520
covered up and reach high levels of 
government.

1425
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,593
You are mistaken.
So it is possible Penn State football 

1426
01:02:56,911 --> 01:02:58,050
program.
Exactly.

1427
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:00,740
But that obviously wasn't government,
but yeah.

1428
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:03,540
But did work with a lot.
I mean he had a god damn charity.

1429
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,670
Yeah.
A lot of people trust and Dusky would,

1430
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:09,210
would work with young kids and take them
on the road and fuck them.

1431
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:10,820
Oh yeah.
Yay.

1432
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,800
Monster.
Aye Yai Yai.

1433
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:18,370
But the point is like fake news.
This podesta thing in this.

1434
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:19,773
I mean who knows what's real and what's 
not real is my point because like this 

1435
01:03:21,701 --> 01:03:22,534
fake news thing is what people are 
calling pizza gate is this whole this 

1436
01:03:27,611 --> 01:03:28,444
comet pizza thing.
So some guy walked into that Comet Ping 

1437
01:03:31,361 --> 01:03:33,210
Pong place,
uh,

1438
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:36,970
yesterday with a loaded assault rifle 
and a,

1439
01:03:36,971 --> 01:03:41,971
an ar and fucking shot around and the 
ground and the building pointed a gun at

1440
01:03:42,161 --> 01:03:46,690
the employee and demanded to know like 
where the sex dungeons were.

1441
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:48,600
Really?
Yeah.

1442
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,730
Cause he,
he was convinced that their,

1443
01:03:51,731 --> 01:03:52,940
their fucking kids in this school.

1444
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:55,650
Oh my God.
Here's the thing with the fake news,

1445
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,710
I had this discussion with,
uh,

1446
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:01,080
with my daughter actually,
and um,

1447
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:02,263
we were talking about like,
how are we just entering an era where 

1448
01:04:04,201 --> 01:04:07,860
you're never going to know what's real 
and what's not like thing is going to be

1449
01:04:07,861 --> 01:04:11,460
so sophisticated on both sides that 
you're never gonna be able to Parse it.

1450
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:14,580
And she had a great point.
She said,

1451
01:04:14,581 --> 01:04:15,414
you know,
when we do papers at school and my wife 

1452
01:04:17,581 --> 01:04:20,700
who's in college now,
uh,

1453
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:26,400
when they do papers for school,
they have to because of the Internet,

1454
01:04:26,401 --> 01:04:28,260
because there's so much stuff you have 
to,

1455
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:29,403
um,
provide the sources for where your 

1456
01:04:31,891 --> 01:04:34,530
information is coming from.
When you're writing these papers,

1457
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:38,610
you have to have a legitimate source 
attached to any of the facts that you're

1458
01:04:38,611 --> 01:04:41,580
putting in there so that they know that 
you did the research and stuff.

1459
01:04:41,581 --> 01:04:45,410
And there's point being there's like 
real.

1460
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:46,283
There will always be really legitimate 
news sources where you can cite that 

1461
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:53,070
people agree that this is a,
a,

1462
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:57,330
a place where it's been filtered or not 
filtered,

1463
01:04:57,331 --> 01:05:02,331
but it comes from a newsworthy source.
You can't just spew stuff and just put,

1464
01:05:02,461 --> 01:05:06,600
you know,
such and such website and have that pass

1465
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,420
in an in an academic setting.
Right.

1466
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:10,283
You know what I mean?
Like there is that little way of 

1467
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:16,620
parsing.
The truth will probably end up being the

1468
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:17,890
way that we all parsed the truth.

1469
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:23,310
I agree with you to a certain extent.
I think that like legitimate studies and

1470
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:24,513
things that were done by legitimate 
researchers where they have peer 

1471
01:05:27,851 --> 01:05:30,160
reviewed studies and everything's been 
vetted out,

1472
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:35,550
but news sources are so suspect now what
we saw from this past election,

1473
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:40,990
whether you support trump or whether you
support hillary sport,

1474
01:05:40,991 --> 01:05:41,824
anybody.
What I saw from this election is very 

1475
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:50,170
little unbiased truth.
What I saw was a lot of,

1476
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:54,560
whether it's pro hillary or anti hillary
pro trump or anti-trump,

1477
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:58,480
I sound a lot of editorial influence.
Yeah,

1478
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,230
and you saw that on television.
You saw that in the New York Times.

1479
01:06:02,231 --> 01:06:03,820
You saw them,
the Washington Post's.

1480
01:06:03,821 --> 01:06:04,654
Do you saw that in what we would think 
of as legitimate news sources without 

1481
01:06:08,591 --> 01:06:10,120
bias?
They're not.

1482
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:12,220
They're just not anymore.
And you know,

1483
01:06:12,221 --> 01:06:17,050
there's some certain people that felt 
like as a person with their own point of

1484
01:06:17,051 --> 01:06:17,884
view and perspective and thoughts on the
burden that one carries by having a 

1485
01:06:22,901 --> 01:06:23,734
voice,
that it's imperative that they get out 

1486
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,490
what they believe about a certain 
candidate.

1487
01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:29,560
Especially with trump.
It could be slanted,

1488
01:06:29,561 --> 01:06:31,390
but there's still,
there's still is,

1489
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,660
did this thing happen or not happen?
You know what I mean?

1490
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:38,590
Did your tax return really right?
Was that information like,

1491
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:40,720
did we all see it?
You know what I mean?

1492
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:41,733
You can slant things and you know,
Fox can put those dangerous things 

1493
01:06:45,221 --> 01:06:46,054
that's dangerous even that's dangerous 
because you could take one aspect of it 

1494
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:52,360
and completely ride it into the ground 
and make it look like,

1495
01:06:52,361 --> 01:06:54,160
look,
here's one thing they were.

1496
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:57,740
They kept harping on about the all these
conspiracy theories,

1497
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,080
theories about Hillary being ill 
bullshit.

1498
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:04,540
She falls asleep while she's standing up
that's ill,

1499
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:07,090
she's not healthy like.
And they would try to.

1500
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:07,953
That was editorial influence on the fact
of her being an old lady who fell down 

1501
01:07:14,471 --> 01:07:18,100
in 2012 and got brain damage,
cracked her head open.

1502
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:19,630
He was like,
literally,

1503
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:23,260
according to Bill Clinton was 
convalescing for six months.

1504
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:27,520
This is his perspective.
He said she was in real bad shape and it

1505
01:07:27,521 --> 01:07:32,350
took her six months to get out of it.
There was the wikileaks emails that show

1506
01:07:32,351 --> 01:07:37,240
that she had a seizure in 2015 during 
the presidential campaign.

1507
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:38,163
She's at that nine slash 11 memorial.
She passes out and all those six 

1508
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:47,080
security people scooping and catcher 
because they were there quick like,

1509
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:49,120
it's fucking happened before.
Like,

1510
01:07:49,121 --> 01:07:51,370
this is not,
this is not an unusual occurrence.

1511
01:07:51,371 --> 01:07:52,204
I don't think.
I think they did a real good job of 

1512
01:07:53,501 --> 01:07:55,840
covering it up,
but there was so many media stories that

1513
01:07:55,841 --> 01:07:56,674
we're talking about the conspiracy 
theory of her being ill or that there 

1514
01:08:00,011 --> 01:08:01,600
was so much.
Um,

1515
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:02,523
so many people were latching on to her 
health and obviously she showed in that 

1516
01:08:07,091 --> 01:08:08,350
debate that,
or helped was fine.

1517
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:08,951
Well,
first of all,

1518
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:11,410
she's on drugs,
but they put her on Modafinil.

1519
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:14,920
That was another thing that was listed 
in the wikileaks.

1520
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,430
She's taking provigil,

1521
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:17,790
she's taking this,
uh,

1522
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,480
this stimulant that they give the 
fighter pilots,

1523
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:21,593
keep them from falling asleep.
It's a drug for people that have 

1524
01:08:23,781 --> 01:08:25,640
narcolepsy,
like she's on this,

1525
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:26,601
so like,
yeah,

1526
01:08:26,601 --> 01:08:29,190
that's probably why she looks stimulated
and she's.

1527
01:08:29,370 --> 01:08:32,360
She's artificially propped up,
so this is a.

1528
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:35,090
This to me was a big sticking point.
It's like I'm not,

1529
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:36,163
I'm not anti Hillary.
I'm anti a lot of the things she stands 

1530
01:08:39,861 --> 01:08:41,150
for,
but I'm not pro trump.

1531
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:42,770
I watched that.
I was like,

1532
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:44,120
well,
you're not being honest with me.

1533
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:46,340
She's,
you're not supposed to fall asleep while

1534
01:08:46,341 --> 01:08:49,250
you're standing up.
If you fall asleep while you're standing

1535
01:08:49,251 --> 01:08:50,540
up,
there's a real problem.

1536
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,020
You shouldn't be doing anything.
You should be in bed and find out what's

1537
01:08:54,021 --> 01:08:55,250
wrong with you.
Yeah,

1538
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:56,323
you should.
You definitely shouldn't be running the 

1539
01:08:57,231 --> 01:08:59,870
world.
It just propping you up.

1540
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,410
I really felt like every time you'd see 
her walking out towards the podium,

1541
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:04,663
that the biggest,
the biggest worry of hers was not 

1542
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:08,083
tipping over to just hear fall on the 
jet when she got to the top stairs of 

1543
01:09:10,991 --> 01:09:14,510
the jet and she tipped for the one 
fucking on camera.

1544
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:16,680
Did you ever see that?
And I never saw watch.

1545
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:17,863
Pull that video up.
And then why we can't walk and why was 

1546
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:24,270
she was a little bit of a cold.
The fucking guy was working on this.

1547
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:25,731
I don't know.
Maybe it does.

1548
01:09:25,731 --> 01:09:28,370
Coke.
Are you worried about sessions coming in

1549
01:09:28,371 --> 01:09:30,410
and ending all the fun?
Look at it.

1550
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:33,050
First of all,
she can't walk without holding onto that

1551
01:09:33,051 --> 01:09:34,890
railing.
She's clutching that thing.

1552
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:36,740
It's hard for everybody.
Shit.

1553
01:09:36,741 --> 01:09:38,300
She gets to the top.
She's slowing down.

1554
01:09:38,301 --> 01:09:40,310
Look,
she's slowing down a lot of steps.

1555
01:09:40,311 --> 01:09:42,020
It's probably all light.
Haven't headed.

1556
01:09:42,070 --> 01:09:43,010
All right,
here we go.

1557
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:44,940
You're good to budget.
Good to do.

1558
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:48,900
She can't walk.
So funny to stop.

1559
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:51,290
This is not good.
None of this is good.

1560
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:54,000
Fall down.
It happens the fuck out of here.

1561
01:09:54,001 --> 01:09:56,690
It doesn't fall like that.
I sometimes come across the stage at the

1562
01:09:56,691 --> 01:09:57,440
comedy store.

1563
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,080
I have to make sure my foot's plan 
turned around and I go like this.

1564
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:03,320
I'm fine.
It's hard.

1565
01:10:03,321 --> 01:10:04,670
Walking around.
Bullshit.

1566
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:07,160
Get on.
Was a lot of steps.

1567
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:09,080
Nope.
That was a lot of steps.

1568
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:12,620
My mind couldn't run the free world 
while your mom shouldn't be president.

1569
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,140
She's.
She's like Hillary's age.

1570
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:18,870
She shouldn't be president.
I think physical health,

1571
01:10:18,871 --> 01:10:19,704
this is something that you should take 
into consideration when you have an 

1572
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:24,440
unbelievably stressful job that looks 
like it drains you,

1573
01:10:24,441 --> 01:10:25,274
like a vampire sucking on your neck.
I couldn't believe both of them were 

1574
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:29,630
still standing at the end.
I mean it was.

1575
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:33,530
So when you think about the travel and 
the speeches and the pressure groups,

1576
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:34,423
both of them.
I mean really that was that they were 

1577
01:10:36,610 --> 01:10:37,650
buying.
Yeah,

1578
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:39,020
he seemed fine.
He did.

1579
01:10:39,290 --> 01:10:42,440
When he gave that last one at 1:30
in the morning and Michigan or whatever.

1580
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:44,540
We're like six that day and he's just 
like.

1581
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:45,900
He just kept going.
Yeah.

1582
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,880
Oh,
I don't know what fast food.

1583
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,220
Yeah,
he's eating pizza.

1584
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,050
Fried Chicken,
Taco bowls.

1585
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:55,540
TACO false.
I remember that picture when he's eating

1586
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,530
a Taco bowl and he goes,
I love Hispanics.

1587
01:10:57,531 --> 01:11:00,170
I'm like,
what in the fuck is this life?

1588
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,110
He says,
I love Hispanics.

1589
01:11:03,111 --> 01:11:07,670
He's eating a Taco bowl in the office 
where he runs his empire.

1590
01:11:07,671 --> 01:11:08,840
I'm like,
this is madness.

1591
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:09,940
That picture.
Look at that.

1592
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:10,783
A good look at that.
The Best Taco bowls are made in trump 

1593
01:11:14,821 --> 01:11:17,250
tower grille.
I love Spanish.

1594
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:20,370
That is so crazy.
It's so crazy.

1595
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:22,080
The whole thing is insane.
Meanwhile,

1596
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:23,003
he didn't even eat that.
He pushed that aside and they brought 

1597
01:11:24,091 --> 01:11:24,924
him a fucking ribeye sessions is going 
to come in and this pot fund for the 

1598
01:11:28,231 --> 01:11:29,250
nation.
He really thinks so.

1599
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,440
That's what they're saying.
Yeah.

1600
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:31,380
That's not what they're saying.

1601
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:32,500
If they're saying,
no,

1602
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:33,060
no,
no.

1603
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:33,893
I've read all the articles.
It's all speculation and it's based on 

1604
01:11:36,601 --> 01:11:37,434
his statements.
Maybe it's based on his past statements 

1605
01:11:42,601 --> 01:11:43,434
about marijuana not being for good 
people and also based on what he could 

1606
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:47,514
potentially do as the attorney general.
However trump has said that he's going 

1607
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:52,224
to leave it up to the states.
I think that trump is a populist and I 

1608
01:11:54,961 --> 01:11:58,740
think that the last thing trump wants 
his people more people,

1609
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:03,000
especially the potheads rallying against
them and saying this is preposterous.

1610
01:12:03,001 --> 01:12:03,834
If you look at the actual fear that that
people have about marijuana versus the 

1611
01:12:07,441 --> 01:12:11,460
physical effects of marijuana versus the
potential revenue gain by these states.

1612
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:15,540
Look at what's happened in Colorado real
estate sales rep for 14 percent.

1613
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:19,860
Drunk driving is down to the lowest rate
it has in decades.

1614
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:22,260
A violent crime is at the lowest rate.

1615
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:25,590
It's been a long time.
There's so many positive benefits to the

1616
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:27,810
marijuana legalization movement.
It's amazing.

1617
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:31,200
Isn't it amazing when you walk through 
Denver with the change?

1618
01:12:31,201 --> 01:12:32,730
Prosperous.
Oh my God.

1619
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:35,200
It's amazing.
I went in and uh,

1620
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:39,750
I went to one of the shops when I was 
performing there last month and,

1621
01:12:39,751 --> 01:12:41,670
uh,
I just wanted to go do it,

1622
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:43,290
you know,
I wasn't even looking to get high.

1623
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:44,124
I just wanted to walk in and buy 
something legit and walk out and just 

1624
01:12:47,311 --> 01:12:50,730
see what that was like.
Very rarely.

1625
01:12:50,731 --> 01:12:52,370
Now,
how about right now we're doing.

1626
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:53,890
I do,
but I can't.

1627
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:55,823
I got to pick up kids.
How frequently that if I do it my day 

1628
01:13:01,051 --> 01:13:03,090
shot,
you know what we're talking about.

1629
01:13:03,091 --> 01:13:06,810
Difficult things that make life easier.
One of the difficult things I like to do

1630
01:13:06,811 --> 01:13:09,510
is edibles.
Yeah.

1631
01:13:09,511 --> 01:13:11,010
You know,
it's funny when you're special.

1632
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:12,930
You actually talked about the gummy 
bears.

1633
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:13,813
Yeah.
And I bought gummy bears when I was 

1634
01:13:15,211 --> 01:13:18,570
there.
This is how out of it I am now.

1635
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,370
Like I used to,
I used to do it every day,

1636
01:13:20,371 --> 01:13:22,950
you know,
and now I haven't for like a decade.

1637
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:24,203
I'm so out of it now that I got back to 
my room with the gummy bears was like 

1638
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:27,623
scared.
We don't know how much do I take the 

1639
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:31,940
whole point.
That's.

1640
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:33,553
Know what I mean?
I really believe that they're like 

1641
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:36,833
running an ultra marathon or something.
Like you should be scared when you take 

1642
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:40,530
those first couple of steps.
Like,

1643
01:13:40,531 --> 01:13:42,060
Jesus,
what am I getting myself into?

1644
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:43,253
Yeah,
but it's.

1645
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:45,270
I don't know.
I'm old school.

1646
01:13:45,271 --> 01:13:46,104
I guess I like it.
I'd like to see it and crumble it and 

1647
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:50,130
puff it and know exactly what I'm doing.
That's nice too,

1648
01:13:50,131 --> 01:13:50,964
but it's a different thing than the 
eating and the eating and the eating it 

1649
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:55,630
because it's scary.
Oh,

1650
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:57,570
be for that reason.
Yeah.

1651
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,750
I liked the journey.
I like it.

1652
01:13:59,751 --> 01:14:02,760
It,
it makes me feel super vulnerable and it

1653
01:14:02,761 --> 01:14:03,594
makes me feel like really in tune with 
any weird distractions I might have in 

1654
01:14:08,461 --> 01:14:09,294
my psyche.
Any weird bumps in the night that are 

1655
01:14:11,171 --> 01:14:12,040
haunting the back

1656
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,920
of my brain.
It just drags them out like get out here

1657
01:14:14,921 --> 01:14:15,754
in the front,
pulls them and put a spotlight on the 

1658
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,870
click.
Tell me what's wrong.

1659
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:25,690
I just want to get high and watch 
narcos.

1660
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:29,660
I like that to really.
So you do it literally.

1661
01:14:29,670 --> 01:14:30,950
Are you joking?
No,

1662
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:31,620
no,
I'm dead.

1663
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:34,180
I'm dead serious.
It's the little bit of the unknown.

1664
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:38,680
Almost trippy kind of anxiety.
Like when you eat mushrooms or something

1665
01:14:38,681 --> 01:14:39,970
and you're like,
okay,

1666
01:14:39,971 --> 01:14:41,320
let's.
What's going to come out with.

1667
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:42,183
Where are we headed?

1668
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:43,053
Well,
that's why I liked the sensory 

1669
01:14:43,271 --> 01:14:46,390
deprivation tank too because you can't 
run from your thoughts,

1670
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,940
traps you with your thoughts and you 
have to confront them.

1671
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:51,280
Right.
It's the what I call the hard work,

1672
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,710
like doing the hard work,
the mental hard work.

1673
01:14:54,230 --> 01:14:55,570
It was like you got be like I,
I.

1674
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:59,110
One of the things I've tried,
I have tried to pride myself in,

1675
01:14:59,111 --> 01:15:03,170
at least I shouldn't say.
One of the things I've done as a,

1676
01:15:03,171 --> 01:15:04,004
an exercise and as I've done it like as 
a discipline is try to constantly and 

1677
01:15:12,071 --> 01:15:14,740
consistently improve everything.
I do whatever I'm doing,

1678
01:15:14,741 --> 01:15:15,574
whether it's martial art thing or or 
comedy thing and I feel like your 

1679
01:15:19,751 --> 01:15:23,120
personality is in that too and even 
podcasting is in that,

1680
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:24,003
like anything that you're doing,
you just try to do better and I don't 

1681
01:15:27,131 --> 01:15:28,690
always succeed,
but there's a,

1682
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:29,524
there's a journey and a process along 
the way and what I've found is the hard 

1683
01:15:32,651 --> 01:15:33,484
work is the best way for me to really 
judge my progress and all those things 

1684
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:38,163
because I'm forced to be alone with my 
thoughts and to be at least the way I 

1685
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:43,450
approach it.

1686
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:47,890
I try to be as objective as possible.
I'm my number one biggest critic.

1687
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:52,090
Like I fucking hate everything I do.
That's why you're good.

1688
01:15:52,270 --> 01:15:53,103
Yeah.
When you sit alone with your thoughts 

1689
01:15:54,581 --> 01:15:55,414
and you think about everything you do 
and you could pick it apart and find 

1690
01:15:58,240 --> 01:15:59,080
problems with it.

1691
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:00,690
Yeah.
That's the hard work.

1692
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:01,560
Yeah,
it's a,

1693
01:16:01,561 --> 01:16:03,210
that's a,
that's a big thing.

1694
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,560
And,
and you know,

1695
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:05,963
smoking,
let you come in the other door and take 

1696
01:16:07,261 --> 01:16:10,560
a look at what you thought was okay.
You know what I mean?

1697
01:16:10,561 --> 01:16:11,394
If you think like if you've got the 
structure and you think you're being 

1698
01:16:12,961 --> 01:16:15,810
hard on yourself and then you come in 
the back door and you're like,

1699
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:18,450
oh,
maybe I'm a little hacky over here.

1700
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,150
You can take some of this and go through
the fucking roof.

1701
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:24,180
Like an asteroid.
Fuck that door.

1702
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,640
You don't want the door.
I've got a lot of stuff in here,

1703
01:16:26,641 --> 01:16:27,960
buddy.
I went,

1704
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:29,730
well,
what was funny was he was one of these.

1705
01:16:29,731 --> 01:16:32,310
Or put you on the moon.
What's that?

1706
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,353
Chocolate cheese.
You can smell the pot through the 

1707
01:16:36,331 --> 01:16:41,010
wrapper.
I need to know what I'm getting into.

1708
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:46,040
Getting into death,
death and just the inevitability.

1709
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:50,850
The only I can see from the pills.
Pills,

1710
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,770
pills.
Let me see what they look like.

1711
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,680
The only negative I could see one 
walking around Denver was.

1712
01:16:55,681 --> 01:16:59,940
There's a lot of scuzzy skate pothead 
kids that are like laying on the street.

1713
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:02,340
You're always gonna get that.
Yeah,

1714
01:17:02,341 --> 01:17:05,430
but it's a little different.
That's just part of the problem.

1715
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:06,190
It's,
you know,

1716
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:07,260
you always get.
Yeah,

1717
01:17:07,261 --> 01:17:10,040
there's always the 14 always going to be

1718
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,320
the case.
It was funny coming out with my bag,

1719
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,700
filled with stuff and not being afraid 
of the cops who just waved to me.

1720
01:17:16,701 --> 01:17:21,300
But then the pot heads who want it.
Sorry,

1721
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:24,230
Geez,
I got stuff to do.

1722
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:25,360
You'll be fine.
I'm like,

1723
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:26,890
my secondhand smoke barely does 
anything.

1724
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:31,900
I'm like your pet dog.
I got my dog so high once I had a um,

1725
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:35,210
a rescue dog and she was a big sweetie.
I loved her.

1726
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,020
She had a rough life before I got her.
When I got her,

1727
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:40,600
she had mange.
Oh ma'am.

1728
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,800
Oh she,
I got her because someone who I knew had

1729
01:17:46,671 --> 01:17:47,504
rescued her like that day and uh,
it was in la and they had found her 

1730
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:56,600
eating out of a garbage can and she was,
she was all fucked up,

1731
01:17:56,860 --> 01:18:01,010
like main Ge.
And they contacted me and they said,

1732
01:18:01,011 --> 01:18:03,290
hey,
I'm just a long shot.

1733
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:05,360
Do you want to adopt a dog?
Because I had a dog.

1734
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:06,591
And I'm like,
well,

1735
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,424
you know,
probably wouldn't be a bad idea to have 

1736
01:18:08,241 --> 01:18:09,110
my dog,
you know,

1737
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:12,560
get a companion.
I go and then they told me and I'm like,

1738
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:13,700
oh no,
like,

1739
01:18:13,701 --> 01:18:15,040
wow,
that's a lot to take on.

1740
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:17,270
And checked her out.
Was she older?

1741
01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:18,710
Um,
she was,

1742
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:22,070
she had had babies for sure because her 
nipples were extended.

1743
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:22,963
We didn't really know how old she was.
She was probably in the neighborhood of 

1744
01:18:25,611 --> 01:18:27,650
two or three,
but she was the sweetest dog ever.

1745
01:18:27,651 --> 01:18:29,080
She so sweet.
What kind?

1746
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:32,120
She was a pit bull.
She had a rough life.

1747
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:34,080
It was a rough life.
And um,

1748
01:18:34,190 --> 01:18:36,720
when I had her in my house,
uh,

1749
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,420
Joey Diaz and I,
we,

1750
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,200
we,
uh,

1751
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,033
went into my office and she would come 
in the office and hang out with me and 

1752
01:18:42,921 --> 01:18:47,921
we did bong hit,
bong hit and this poor dog got hot box.

1753
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:53,600
Figure out what was going on because she
was freaking out,

1754
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:57,620
freaking out.
And she was like hiding under desks.

1755
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:58,633
Like she would run,
she would run across the room and they 

1756
01:19:00,901 --> 01:19:05,330
just get under the desk or I guess 
tucked in and we're like,

1757
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,580
oh my God,
she's high.

1758
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:08,260
The poor dogs.
Hi.

1759
01:19:09,270 --> 01:19:11,270
So yeah,
you can get someone,

1760
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:12,800
you can get that.
Uh,

1761
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,160
I uh,
I can,

1762
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:17,510
I think that,
uh,

1763
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:19,270
I hope you're right.
I hope that,

1764
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:21,020
you know,
what the most interesting thing watching

1765
01:19:21,021 --> 01:19:23,870
this whole trump thing,
like I hope you're right about sessions,

1766
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:27,350
I think it's going to be really 
interesting.

1767
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:28,573
I feel like we're watching one of those 
movies where like the regular guy 

1768
01:19:30,861 --> 01:19:33,740
becomes president and he comes in like,
well,

1769
01:19:33,741 --> 01:19:36,740
just fix the problem,
just the taxes and fix the bridge.

1770
01:19:36,770 --> 01:19:39,170
That's how it works.
And like these practical,

1771
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:40,253
like things that you could do,
like let's just talk to Taiwan and 

1772
01:19:43,251 --> 01:19:46,250
Siemens maybe they'll be okay and it's 
like,

1773
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:51,310
will this work or do or is the way of 
operating with so immeshed in policy and

1774
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:54,173
the way that things were,
do you need that structure to actually 

1775
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:58,513
steer the ship?

1776
01:19:58,940 --> 01:19:59,773
You know what I mean?
This is really kind of free form your 

1777
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:05,923
writing.
I think in that sense that's probably 

1778
01:20:06,741 --> 01:20:08,040
the most positive aspect

1779
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,400
of this guy being president is that we 
really will find out.

1780
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:12,293
Yeah,
it might be the only way we find out 

1781
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:16,680
where you're going to find out.
We've got to really find out to find.

1782
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:17,583
And also he's going to fucking tell us 
like if there's some shit is funky 

1783
01:20:21,961 --> 01:20:23,460
behind the scenes,
you know,

1784
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,313
like there's a lot of talk online about 
trump lying and his tweets about like 

1785
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,310
fake votes,
you know,

1786
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:33,340
like fake votes cost him the popular 
vote.

1787
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:38,190
Like he just sometimes he just says shit
man.

1788
01:20:38,230 --> 01:20:41,250
I don't know if he is doing it as a 
strategy.

1789
01:20:41,490 --> 01:20:42,270
I don't know.
I mean,

1790
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:42,901
I don't know.
I,

1791
01:20:42,901 --> 01:20:43,500
it's,
it's,

1792
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,870
it's also possible that he doesn't 
really believe it,

1793
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:48,150
but that he knows that if he puts it out
there,

1794
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,840
people are going to repeat it.
Yeah.

1795
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,990
There was an article in recently that I 
saw,

1796
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,520
I forget what the magazine was,
Jamie,

1797
01:20:53,521 --> 01:20:54,354
maybe you could find it,
but it was about a guy who writes the 

1798
01:20:55,861 --> 01:20:56,694
fake news and they track this dude down 
and he just writes fake stories like 

1799
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:07,280
about George Soros paying protests is 
350 bucks an hour to test against trump.

1800
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:09,010
Like you just make stuff up.
Yeah.

1801
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:12,780
And they asked him why he did it and 
what he said was,

1802
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:13,614
he said essentially he started out as 
like an exercise we'll sort of to prove 

1803
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:21,420
how gullible these all right folks could
be.

1804
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:22,643
Some of them,
at least some of them would just see 

1805
01:21:24,631 --> 01:21:27,680
things without looking into it at all.
They would just start tweeting it.

1806
01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:28,680
Yeah.
You know.

1807
01:21:28,681 --> 01:21:29,790
And,
and he was right.

1808
01:21:29,791 --> 01:21:31,980
He was right.
But he started making a lot of money.

1809
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:34,230
Right?
These guys are making like $10,000

1810
01:21:34,231 --> 01:21:37,210
a month writing fake store clicks of 
clicks.

1811
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:38,550
That's.
Yeah.

1812
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:41,490
Then you're writing fake stories.
Now we're going to pass that up.

1813
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:42,383
You know,
you're going to just write fake stories 

1814
01:21:43,711 --> 01:21:44,544
now.
So like what you were saying earlier 

1815
01:21:45,661 --> 01:21:50,220
about like us entering into an era where
you can't really tell what's true or not

1816
01:21:50,221 --> 01:21:53,550
true.
And like if that's the case,

1817
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:57,090
I mean that's why it's so imperative 
that someone like the Washington Post or

1818
01:21:57,270 --> 01:22:00,510
the New York Times cannot be biased in 
any way.

1819
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:01,553
You have to like,
as clearly as you can emphasize the 

1820
01:22:04,621 --> 01:22:05,454
facts of every story.
Even if you feel like you have an 

1821
01:22:07,711 --> 01:22:10,890
obligation to show how horrible person 
president trump is,

1822
01:22:10,891 --> 01:22:11,940
just to let people know,
like,

1823
01:22:11,941 --> 01:22:14,910
this guy can't get in the office.
As soon as you start doing that,

1824
01:22:14,911 --> 01:22:15,744
you embolden the people who oppose you.
Like it's very dangerous for ideas in 

1825
01:22:19,771 --> 01:22:22,980
general because it's so hard.
Like I.

1826
01:22:23,190 --> 01:22:24,300
I'm not,
I don't do it,

1827
01:22:24,301 --> 01:22:25,134
but it's so.
It's so hard for anybody to completely 

1828
01:22:27,721 --> 01:22:30,660
be unbiased and establish just the 
facts.

1829
01:22:30,661 --> 01:22:32,250
Even when they're disturbing and 
uncomfortable.

1830
01:22:33,170 --> 01:22:34,950
They don't like that too.
People don't like that.

1831
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:37,800
You ever watch PBS news?
The News Hour?

1832
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:40,260
Yeah.
That's probably as pure as you can get,

1833
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:41,543
right?
I mean that's just purely as factual as 

1834
01:22:44,071 --> 01:22:49,071
we can put it out there and it doesn't 
mirror a lot of anything else.

1835
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,290
CNN,
MSNBC,

1836
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:55,830
or Fox,
that's all that.

1837
01:22:55,940 --> 01:22:56,773
That PBS has.
Just it feels like it's the last place 

1838
01:22:59,221 --> 01:23:02,220
where grownups work.
This person makes $10,000

1839
01:23:02,221 --> 01:23:05,010
a month writing fake news.
Yeah.

1840
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,060
Yeah.
This

1841
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:08,160
is just make stuff up,
but what is the website?

1842
01:23:08,161 --> 01:23:10,950
Jamie?
This one was from market watchers,

1843
01:23:10,970 --> 01:23:11,803
also an NPR story.
I think the Martin watches the one that 

1844
01:23:13,411 --> 01:23:14,420
I read.
I think that's the,

1845
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:15,303
the,
the,

1846
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:16,553
one of the problems with the fake news 
too is I have a guy drives me to the 

1847
01:23:18,961 --> 01:23:21,480
airport all the time and he's like,
no,

1848
01:23:21,481 --> 01:23:26,070
I saw George Soros is paying the people 
to protest and my wife,

1849
01:23:26,071 --> 01:23:28,590
I saw it on facebook and my wife said,
no,

1850
01:23:28,591 --> 01:23:30,000
that's not a story.
And he said,

1851
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:31,800
but look,
now it's on CNN.

1852
01:23:31,801 --> 01:23:34,140
They're talking about the same story.
So it is true.

1853
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,650
The problem is all these people editing 
these news organizations,

1854
01:23:37,890 --> 01:23:38,723
they're running with the story.
They're being tricked by the fake news 

1855
01:23:40,650 --> 01:23:42,090
to begin with.
Wow.

1856
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,010
Jesus Christ.
I know.

1857
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:44,873
It's very slippery.
She see the fake porn going on at CNN 

1858
01:23:48,211 --> 01:23:49,044
for 30 minutes of fake porn during 
Anthony Bourdain show out like 

1859
01:23:51,871 --> 01:23:52,830
Thanksgiving night.
Yeah.

1860
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:54,890
It's a total fake story.
Everyone else did it.

1861
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:55,733
That it was real.
Yeah.

1862
01:23:56,630 --> 01:23:57,191
Yeah.
That,

1863
01:23:57,191 --> 01:23:58,730
uh,
that was something somebody just thought

1864
01:23:58,731 --> 01:23:59,564
it'd be funny to.
Did he even have a photoshop screenshot 

1865
01:24:01,881 --> 01:24:02,930
or something like that?
Yeah,

1866
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:04,990
that's genius.
I mean it's,

1867
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:08,010
you know,
the scary thing is a,

1868
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:10,230
that's how wars start,
right?

1869
01:24:10,290 --> 01:24:11,123
That's how Vietnam started getting a 
little carried away when they created 

1870
01:24:13,831 --> 01:24:16,830
the take down a notch where we created 
this fake stories,

1871
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,230
Iraq,
same stuff.

1872
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:20,820
It's,
you can manipulate stuff.

1873
01:24:20,821 --> 01:24:23,550
You can create big events off of that.

1874
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:26,340
Well,
here obviously we don't know what really

1875
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:29,850
has gone on that lead to people.
Right in that pizza gate stuff.

1876
01:24:29,851 --> 01:24:30,684
I don't,
I didn't investigate it enough to know 

1877
01:24:31,741 --> 01:24:32,574
if it's bullshit or not.
I just didn't look into it and to be 

1878
01:24:34,651 --> 01:24:36,360
honest,
that's it.

1879
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:37,883
What if it was bullshit and if it is 
bullshit and this guy thought it was 

1880
01:24:41,191 --> 01:24:45,670
real and he goes in and what have you 
shot somebody who's as.

1881
01:24:46,230 --> 01:24:47,063
I mean,
at what point is there some sort of 

1882
01:24:49,561 --> 01:24:53,250
responsibility like as a,
as a culture,

1883
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:56,420
like when,
if someone's inciting hate towards him,

1884
01:24:56,421 --> 01:24:59,610
very specific establishment that really 
hasn't done anything wrong,

1885
01:24:59,611 --> 01:25:01,890
right?
Like that's kind of a criminal act,

1886
01:25:01,891 --> 01:25:03,300
right?
In a way,

1887
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:06,390
if you're saying like if you,
if you pick a donut shop,

1888
01:25:06,391 --> 01:25:06,781
yum,
yum.

1889
01:25:06,781 --> 01:25:08,550
Donuts side of yum.
Yum.

1890
01:25:08,551 --> 01:25:10,680
Donuts is where the elites go to fuck 
kids,

1891
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:10,950
right?

1892
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:13,590
You just make all that up and then 
people show up a yum,

1893
01:25:13,591 --> 01:25:17,010
yum donuts and just start shooting 
people because you won't tell them where

1894
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:19,920
you're fucking the kids.
That's decades.

1895
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:21,960
Again,
this is just.

1896
01:25:21,961 --> 01:25:23,420
If it's a fake story,
I don't know.

1897
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:24,900
I don't know.
Shit.

1898
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:26,580
I'm just going to be real clear about 
that.

1899
01:25:26,790 --> 01:25:28,260
I literally have.
I.

1900
01:25:28,261 --> 01:25:29,550
There's so much kids who.
Well,

1901
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:30,750
you should look into it.
No,

1902
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:33,000
I shouldn't you.
If you want to.

1903
01:25:33,030 --> 01:25:33,863
You go ahead.
Dear.

1904
01:25:33,890 --> 01:25:38,890
You cannot be responsible for every 
fucking story that's in the news today.

1905
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:43,050
You will lose your mind and I'm trying 
to do less and less of that in my life,

1906
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:47,640
but my point is what we know for a fact.
There's a lot of fake stories.

1907
01:25:48,090 --> 01:25:50,190
We also know for a fact.
There's a lot of creeps.

1908
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:51,780
Yeah,
a lot of scary,

1909
01:25:51,781 --> 01:25:52,614
sketchy people that are in positions of 
power and they have been forever and 

1910
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:58,830
they're starting to get exposed more 
than they ever have been before,

1911
01:25:58,831 --> 01:25:59,550
so I don't know the

1912
01:25:59,550 --> 01:26:01,770
fuck the truth.
That's kind of the interesting thing.

1913
01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:05,270
That's it's the good and bad of the time
that we live in.

1914
01:26:06,350 --> 01:26:08,630
Everything can be exposed now,
which is great.

1915
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:12,230
Like you can expose people being brutal 
to another group.

1916
01:26:12,231 --> 01:26:15,200
You can expose crimes by just recording 
it on your phone.

1917
01:26:15,590 --> 01:26:16,423
You can't get away with stuff anymore 
because everyone's on video all the 

1918
01:26:20,271 --> 01:26:22,400
time.
So in that way,

1919
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:26,360
the truth has never been more clear.
But if it's.

1920
01:26:26,410 --> 01:26:27,243
But then you have this manipulation of 
that truth in certain instances where 

1921
01:26:29,871 --> 01:26:32,180
you don't have that video proof.
It's uh,

1922
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:35,180
it's right.
I mean it's very conflicting.

1923
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:36,183
Well,
it's what we were talking about earlier 

1924
01:26:37,151 --> 01:26:39,640
when we were saying about fake stories 
that it's,

1925
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:44,530
we're getting to this weird era where 
you can't tell whether or not a story is

1926
01:26:44,531 --> 01:26:46,170
true or not.
Like he gets really sketchy,

1927
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:49,480
gets really strange.
I think there's going to be.

1928
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:53,560
This is just pure speculation,
pure bro Science.

1929
01:26:53,770 --> 01:26:55,090
Nice.
Giving you a bro.

1930
01:26:55,091 --> 01:26:55,924
Science warning.
My favorite kind is the only kind of 

1931
01:26:57,311 --> 01:26:58,144
understand I think the other doing these
things where they're able to transmit 

1932
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:05,710
words from person to person through the 
Internet,

1933
01:27:06,190 --> 01:27:09,490
brain to brain.
Like somehow or another I can't,

1934
01:27:09,491 --> 01:27:11,260
I'm not going to do a good job 
explaining it,

1935
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:12,483
but they've been able to essentially put
a word in your head and then do it 

1936
01:27:16,811 --> 01:27:17,644
accurately from a long distance away 
through some sort of electrical impulse 

1937
01:27:21,161 --> 01:27:22,870
or something that they blast into your 
head,

1938
01:27:23,230 --> 01:27:26,410
but right now it's like like a word,
a word.

1939
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:28,713
I think it's entirely possible within 
our lifetime that one day someone is 

1940
01:27:33,521 --> 01:27:35,620
going to figure out how.
If you can do that,

1941
01:27:35,621 --> 01:27:36,454
if you could transmit something from 
brain to brain like that through the 

1942
01:27:38,021 --> 01:27:39,460
Internet,
through some sort of an interface,

1943
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:44,740
they're going to figure out how to.
How to broadcast intention,

1944
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:46,083
so instead of a language,
they're going to figure out how to 

1945
01:27:49,421 --> 01:27:54,250
broadcast what the feeling is behind you
thinking something like if I say,

1946
01:27:54,490 --> 01:27:55,660
Hey,
Tom,

1947
01:27:55,661 --> 01:27:59,110
papa has a comedy special on epics this 
Friday night,

1948
01:27:59,111 --> 01:28:01,000
you should definitely see it.
He's fucking hilarious.

1949
01:28:01,001 --> 01:28:04,120
He's a great guy and I really want you 
guys to check that out.

1950
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:07,540
There's a feeling that comes with that 
of feeling like,

1951
01:28:07,570 --> 01:28:08,770
you know,
I really love you.

1952
01:28:08,771 --> 01:28:10,270
You're a great guy.
You're hilarious.

1953
01:28:10,271 --> 01:28:14,770
I want your specialty to kick ass,
but so that's like an intention and that

1954
01:28:14,771 --> 01:28:19,771
intention is in some way trapped inside 
a language.

1955
01:28:20,470 --> 01:28:25,470
It's trapped inside like language in 
civilization and all the structures that

1956
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:26,884
we've created around it,
but if you could somehow remove the 

1957
01:28:29,681 --> 01:28:33,130
language and just what is the intention 
behind.

1958
01:28:33,131 --> 01:28:35,680
I love you.
What's the intention behind?

1959
01:28:35,950 --> 01:28:39,610
I would like to paint something 
beautiful like what is it outside of the

1960
01:28:39,611 --> 01:28:42,970
words you would use to describe it in a 
sentence.

1961
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:45,273
If they could figure out some sort of 
maybe icon based or some geometric 

1962
01:28:49,451 --> 01:28:52,750
pattern based language.
New Language you can express.

1963
01:28:52,751 --> 01:28:53,584
Yeah,
and we would have to learn that 

1964
01:28:54,851 --> 01:28:55,720
language,
right?

1965
01:28:55,930 --> 01:29:00,550
But it would be an intention based 
language where wouldn't matter what your

1966
01:29:00,551 --> 01:29:02,220
language,
whether you speak German

1967
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:04,680
or French.
It's a little like minority report.

1968
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:05,543
Then they will take take that you had 
this intention to kill someone and they 

1969
01:29:08,431 --> 01:29:10,350
come and arrest you before it happens.
Well,

1970
01:29:10,351 --> 01:29:12,630
I just feel like everything that's 
happening in the brain,

1971
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:13,523
right,
it's all trapped in the brain and then 

1972
01:29:15,031 --> 01:29:15,864
gets expressed through either the 
fingers or through the mouth right now 

1973
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:21,720
through the body,
but it's all.

1974
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:22,583
These are all these ideas are rolling 
around inside the body and then then 

1975
01:29:26,671 --> 01:29:28,510
they get expressed through something.
Right?

1976
01:29:28,590 --> 01:29:31,380
What if there's a way to get right to 
them?

1977
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:35,250
You where you don't need the book.
You don't need to do the double birds,

1978
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:36,050
right?
You don't.

1979
01:29:36,050 --> 01:29:36,883
You know you can.
You could express that through the 

1980
01:29:40,771 --> 01:29:44,310
actual things that are going on in 
between your ears.

1981
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,040
Still Change.
Standup for sure.

1982
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:48,390
It will be for us.

1983
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:51,273
Walk out onstage that guys hilarious and
will be like blockbuster video of art 

1984
01:29:56,371 --> 01:30:00,390
forms.
People will still want songs.

1985
01:30:00,450 --> 01:30:03,600
Songs will always be cool when you can 
read minds.

1986
01:30:03,601 --> 01:30:05,310
No one wants to hear your stupid joke.
Yeah,

1987
01:30:05,311 --> 01:30:08,340
you're stupid jokes.
Yeah.

1988
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:10,170
I don't know.
I don't know if a.

1989
01:30:10,330 --> 01:30:12,360
sounds like that's a total stoner 
science,

1990
01:30:12,361 --> 01:30:12,760
right?
Yeah.

1991
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:13,593
That's definitely a long way off.
Now there's someone right now writing 

1992
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:19,200
this down because this dude,
he's got a spectrum,

1993
01:30:20,130 --> 01:30:22,030
but I can do it.
He's um,

1994
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:26,220
he's ambitious and he's got an idea.
You can make it true.

1995
01:30:26,350 --> 01:30:29,190
Well,
if you have those htc vive headsets on,

1996
01:30:29,191 --> 01:30:32,130
have you ever put those things on you?
Jesus Christ,

1997
01:30:32,131 --> 01:30:35,070
they're a game changer.
But you mean the virtual reality stuff?

1998
01:30:35,071 --> 01:30:35,550
Yes.
Yeah,

1999
01:30:35,550 --> 01:30:36,151
yeah,
yeah.

2000
01:30:36,151 --> 01:30:39,200
There's a couple different ones.
Now there's a rift.

2001
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:40,500
I didn't,
I don't know the Samsung,

2002
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:42,270
but the HTC is one.

2003
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:45,030
Samsung has one that you slide right 
into your,

2004
01:30:45,031 --> 01:30:46,290
uh,
like a phone,

2005
01:30:46,291 --> 01:30:47,550
right?
You can sign a phone to do it.

2006
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:49,710
Oh,
you said your phone into the thing?

2007
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:50,780
Yeah.
You have like a dog,

2008
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:53,130
like the Google Pixel.
Is that too?

2009
01:30:53,150 --> 01:30:55,350
It was like,
right?

2010
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:56,610
Yeah.
And you slide it in.

2011
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,740
I did that with the New York Times.
Hadn't one.

2012
01:30:58,741 --> 01:30:59,574
They sent like a cardboard one and slide
it in and all of a sudden you're with 

2013
01:31:03,001 --> 01:31:05,640
the refugees in Syria walking down the 
street.

2014
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:08,520
You're looking around you and there's 
people behind you and in front of you.

2015
01:31:08,610 --> 01:31:09,720
Fucking bizarre.
Yeah.

2016
01:31:09,721 --> 01:31:11,430
It looks pretty intense.
Well,

2017
01:31:11,431 --> 01:31:12,264
they can do that now.
Like the processing power of phones is 

2018
01:31:14,371 --> 01:31:16,410
pretty good.
The crazy thing is like you could take a

2019
01:31:16,411 --> 01:31:19,350
regular smart phone.
It's not bad,

2020
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:24,740
but it's not as good as like the the 
high end ones and we're in an infancy of

2021
01:31:24,901 --> 01:31:25,380
this stuff.

2022
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:27,480
Most people don't even know what it is 
when you bring it up.

2023
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,120
Yeah,
it's coming to Dunkin has one.

2024
01:31:30,121 --> 01:31:30,954
When you're in this underwater 
environment in a whale comes up to say 

2025
01:31:33,001 --> 01:31:34,650
hi to you know,
and you're like,

2026
01:31:34,651 --> 01:31:38,250
Holy Shit.
Fuck in front of me.

2027
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,140
You're like looking at the whales.
I.

2028
01:31:40,141 --> 01:31:40,861
You're like,
Oh,

2029
01:31:40,861 --> 01:31:41,694
this is so weird.
Because you really feel like you're at 

2030
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:46,770
the bottom of the ocean and these things
swim overhead.

2031
01:31:46,771 --> 01:31:48,600
You watched them.
Holy Cow.

2032
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:50,580
Oh my God.
It's a mind fuck.

2033
01:31:50,610 --> 01:31:51,443
So you could walk in,
sit in the sit in the chair and watch a 

2034
01:31:53,431 --> 01:31:57,600
standup show you one special,
100 percent.

2035
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:01,120
Next aspect of doing your special would 
be releasing it that way.

2036
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:04,870
Great idea.
That is Kevin Hart's already done it.

2037
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:05,733
He's probably,
he's done it in a football field with a 

2038
01:32:08,081 --> 01:32:11,640
jet pack with a whale.
Comes through the middle.

2039
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:13,930
Katt a on stage.

2040
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:15,910
Did you ever see that and a fuck?
Yeah.

2041
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:18,010
Kat Williams.
Thank you for being here.

2042
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:19,870
He's the best.
Thank you for being alive.

2043
01:32:19,871 --> 01:32:20,704
That guy makes me laugh so hard.
He's fucking funny because he's so 

2044
01:32:24,701 --> 01:32:27,340
crazy.
People kind of forget how funny he is.

2045
01:32:27,370 --> 01:32:30,580
Oh my God.
His early stuff like going after Michael

2046
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:31,690
Jackson and stuff.
Oh,

2047
01:32:31,770 --> 01:32:33,640
so good.
So good.

2048
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:35,110
So good.
He's funny,

2049
01:32:35,111 --> 01:32:35,890
man.
Pure,

2050
01:32:35,890 --> 01:32:38,080
original,
funny as hell.

2051
01:32:38,230 --> 01:32:41,460
Wild mother fucker.
Guys live a life.

2052
01:32:41,610 --> 01:32:44,350
He's not worried about back pain.
He doesn't have responsibility of.

2053
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:47,680
He's not worried about getting his kids 
to school.

2054
01:32:47,681 --> 01:32:49,330
He's just being cat.
He's cannon.

2055
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:53,770
Fist fights with 17 year olds and losing
that's right in the yard.

2056
01:32:53,830 --> 01:32:58,830
The kid beat his ass around,
took his back and he's like super lucky.

2057
01:32:59,561 --> 01:33:03,020
That kid didn't give him brain damage.
I love how everybody else's realizing.

2058
01:33:03,030 --> 01:33:04,180
Wait,
I think that's Kat.

2059
01:33:04,930 --> 01:33:08,620
Kat Williams is getting into God Damn 
Street fight with a young kid.

2060
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:12,010
That was hilarious.
He sucker punched the kid.

2061
01:33:12,490 --> 01:33:13,323
Something tells me cats not sitting down
with that notebook every morning like I 

2062
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:17,980
have to do this.
Maybe.

2063
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:18,933
I mean,
he seems like one of those guys that 

2064
01:33:19,691 --> 01:33:24,691
just flies feel like he also,
like maybe I think he's a little smarter

2065
01:33:25,211 --> 01:33:26,044
than people give them credit for and I 
think it's entirely possible that he 

2066
01:33:28,691 --> 01:33:29,524
might in some sort of a weird,
whether it's conscious or subconscious 

2067
01:33:31,961 --> 01:33:34,480
way put himself in these horrible 
situations.

2068
01:33:34,481 --> 01:33:37,990
So he has funny shit to talk about.
I don't know.

2069
01:33:37,991 --> 01:33:40,490
My instinct is he just ends up in those 
things and that.

2070
01:33:40,491 --> 01:33:42,380
So that's the beauty that comes out the 
end.

2071
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:45,700
You might be right,
but I don't think he's as calculated.

2072
01:33:45,850 --> 01:33:47,410
You might be right.
It might be.

2073
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:49,210
It might be a little bit of both things.

2074
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:50,940
Yeah.
But the thing is,

2075
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:52,360
he's very smart,
man.

2076
01:33:53,530 --> 01:33:55,270
You can't be that funny and not be 
smart.

2077
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:56,140
He,
um,

2078
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:58,120
said something that I,
I was like,

2079
01:33:58,150 --> 01:34:00,310
oh yeah.
Like I was listening to this video,

2080
01:34:00,311 --> 01:34:04,450
it was him in the backseat of a limo and
he's drunk driving around.

2081
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:05,373
And uh,
there was talking about before he goes 

2082
01:34:06,701 --> 01:34:10,000
on stage and one of the things that he 
said was that he doesn't eat anything,

2083
01:34:10,790 --> 01:34:11,740
don't eat.
He goes,

2084
01:34:11,890 --> 01:34:14,380
you know,
I wanna I don't want to be full when I'm

2085
01:34:14,381 --> 01:34:16,000
onstage.
I don't want to feel like that.

2086
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:18,460
You like,
you want to eat better off being hungry.

2087
01:34:19,010 --> 01:34:20,680
Like you don't want to be slowed down by
food.

2088
01:34:20,681 --> 01:34:21,950
I'm like,
that's a great idea.

2089
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:23,140
Yeah,
I know that.

2090
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,510
But yet I would still violate that if I 
was hungry.

2091
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:29,200
Like I'd rather like if I had a show at 
8:00

2092
01:34:29,201 --> 01:34:32,150
and I was kind of hungry at seven,
I'll eat a fucking cheeseburger.

2093
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:33,013
You would?
Yeah,

2094
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:34,023
for sure.
I'm going to drink a milkshake really 

2095
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:39,700
for the longest time I would just eat 
whatever the fuck I wanted to daily.

2096
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:40,593
I could never do that.
But then I watched that Kat Williams 

2097
01:34:42,641 --> 01:34:43,660
thing and I went,
you know what?

2098
01:34:43,661 --> 01:34:44,494
He's right.
You really shouldn't eat before you go 

2099
01:34:46,331 --> 01:34:47,164
on stage.
Like you can always have like a little 

2100
01:34:48,461 --> 01:34:51,070
bit in between chose.
But when you have a meal,

2101
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:54,490
you go down enough.
You just slow down a little bit.

2102
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:55,061
Yeah.
Oh,

2103
01:34:55,061 --> 01:34:58,190
absolutely.
You might be able to power now if

2104
01:34:58,190 --> 01:34:59,360
I'm in.
If I'm in trouble.

2105
01:34:59,530 --> 01:35:01,530
The hardest part about being on the road
is windy.

2106
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:02,383
You eat.
I really feel like the timing of when 

2107
01:35:03,921 --> 01:35:06,230
you eat and when you're going to perform
and all that stuff.

2108
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:07,423
So if I get past the 4:00,
like if I eat like late early in the 

2109
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:13,460
afternoon and then getting too close to 
the show,

2110
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:14,623
it's not enough for a meal.
Then I'll try and a protein bar at to 

2111
01:35:17,451 --> 01:35:19,830
get me through the show.
Something light that's,

2112
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:21,980
you know,
I'm not going to be up there digesting.

2113
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:23,083
I remember Jim Carrey,
there was in some interview the guy who 

2114
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:27,403
directed him in like ace Ventura or 
something and they said get all of this 

2115
01:35:29,721 --> 01:35:32,420
stuff before lunch because once he eats 
he's a different guy.

2116
01:35:32,421 --> 01:35:33,254
Like that hyper hilarious Jim Carey.
You got to get that in the morning 

2117
01:35:36,531 --> 01:35:38,480
because once he starts eating it's a 
different guy.

2118
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,190
No Shit.
Yeah,

2119
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:41,810
it makes sense,
right?

2120
01:35:41,811 --> 01:35:43,100
I mean you get like,
oh,

2121
01:35:43,101 --> 01:35:44,720
I just want to nap.
Yeah.

2122
01:35:44,721 --> 01:35:47,120
You can't be like ace ventura,
pet detective,

2123
01:35:47,690 --> 01:35:49,790
you can't be pulling your ass cheeks 
apart.

2124
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:53,510
When you think about how over the top 
that fucking movie was,

2125
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:54,373
he was so over the top,
like he took over the top to a new 

2126
01:35:58,071 --> 01:35:59,750
place,
a whole nother place.

2127
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:01,100
You know,
like people who would say like,

2128
01:36:01,101 --> 01:36:01,934
you know,
like physical comedy doesn't really 

2129
01:36:02,871 --> 01:36:05,270
work.
Like maybe if you have asset.

2130
01:36:05,450 --> 01:36:06,283
Yeah.
But if you go balls out like that guy 

2131
01:36:07,731 --> 01:36:08,660
does,
you tell me.

2132
01:36:08,661 --> 01:36:12,860
That's hilarious.
Like pet detective till to this day.

2133
01:36:12,861 --> 01:36:14,780
I'll watch that and it's fucking 
hilarious.

2134
01:36:14,810 --> 01:36:15,643
Just hiking his pants up is hilarious.
Observed human beings just get the 

2135
01:36:20,770 --> 01:36:21,603
camera,
get the camera on this guy with his 

2136
01:36:23,901 --> 01:36:26,130
facial expressions and running around 
me.

2137
01:36:26,150 --> 01:36:29,030
Created this incredibly bizarre 
character.

2138
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:32,130
Like what the fuck am I watching?
But it was so over the top.

2139
01:36:32,170 --> 01:36:34,310
So funny.
He's hilarious.

2140
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:35,660
When I was in high school,
I would,

2141
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:38,440
I would imitate him.
His invitations.

2142
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:39,313
Remember when he did,
he had that set where he was doing like 

2143
01:36:40,641 --> 01:36:42,770
on golden pond.
He was like,

2144
01:36:42,771 --> 01:36:45,170
strawberries,
strawberries.

2145
01:36:45,171 --> 01:36:46,890
He did the whole,
the whole golden pond.

2146
01:36:46,891 --> 01:36:49,010
He did all these great impressions.
Oh yeah.

2147
01:36:49,050 --> 01:36:51,110
You can do a lot of impressions.
That's how I would,

2148
01:36:51,111 --> 01:36:52,880
uh,
try and impress girls.

2149
01:36:52,881 --> 01:36:55,460
Doing his impressions.
Yeah.

2150
01:36:55,461 --> 01:36:59,150
He's a fucking super talented guy.
Yeah.

2151
01:36:59,450 --> 01:37:01,550
Really talented.
Just the energy,

2152
01:37:01,551 --> 01:37:02,384
the pure energy.
And he changed his act break with 

2153
01:37:03,861 --> 01:37:05,810
Rodney.
I think he was opening for Ronnie and he

2154
01:37:05,811 --> 01:37:06,644
was doing kind of straight standup and 
then said he wanted to go this new 

2155
01:37:08,961 --> 01:37:09,794
direction and start doing these 
characters and voices and impressions 

2156
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,890
and Rodney kind of encouraged them to,
to go for it.

2157
01:37:15,890 --> 01:37:17,690
Like you can buy them on my show.
I don't care.

2158
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:20,510
That's interesting.
You could bomb.

2159
01:37:20,511 --> 01:37:22,790
I don't care.
Get out there.

2160
01:37:23,210 --> 01:37:25,010
He's a bad motherfucker.
Yeah.

2161
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:25,873
That was a painter who was on a.
He was on a movie set once and a friend 

2162
01:37:30,051 --> 01:37:33,290
of mine was working on the set and he 
didn't like his performance on the take.

2163
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:34,740
He was just like,
fuck.

2164
01:37:34,910 --> 01:37:35,743
He's like,
he didn't,

2165
01:37:36,170 --> 01:37:38,300
didn't feel like it was up to his 
standards or something like that.

2166
01:37:38,301 --> 01:37:40,430
Yeah.
So to burn off energy,

2167
01:37:40,490 --> 01:37:44,060
he just smashed his fucking car.
It was a car that was there,

2168
01:37:44,061 --> 01:37:48,800
like one of the production drawers.
He just smashed it with a bat.

2169
01:37:48,830 --> 01:37:50,840
I don't remember what he hit it with.
I don't remember what they said.

2170
01:37:50,841 --> 01:37:54,200
He picked something up and started 
whacking this fucking car and you know,

2171
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:56,190
this is Jim Carrey when it's at the top

2172
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:57,540
of the heap.
Well,

2173
01:37:58,090 --> 01:37:59,560
just let him wreck the car.
Will just.

2174
01:38:00,150 --> 01:38:01,130
He doesn't get.
He's just,

2175
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:04,790
he just wanted to get some energy out.
Fucking fucking fucking.

2176
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:07,010
Just smashed fast.
Fast.

2177
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,220
Okay.
All right.

2178
01:38:08,221 --> 01:38:09,054
We're back.
And then he went and did the sea that 

2179
01:38:10,081 --> 01:38:11,160
like,
Holy Shit.

2180
01:38:11,161 --> 01:38:13,290
That must have been hilarious.
It's great.

2181
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:17,230
Do you sometimes think that maybe you 
should be crazier as a,

2182
01:38:17,610 --> 01:38:19,260
as as a comedian?
Oh yeah,

2183
01:38:19,261 --> 01:38:21,060
I know that feeling.
I know exactly what you're saying.

2184
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:23,340
I know where you're going with that,
but if you were crazy,

2185
01:38:23,341 --> 01:38:24,720
you'd be funnier.
Right?

2186
01:38:24,721 --> 01:38:28,380
Like if completely reckless,
crazy person.

2187
01:38:28,890 --> 01:38:31,540
If you were more cat,
right?

2188
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:34,320
Like I always hear the bit like he 
always hear like the stories,

2189
01:38:34,321 --> 01:38:36,210
like they had to get the guy to the 
show,

2190
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:39,113
get the guy to the show.
Was there a half hour early going 

2191
01:38:41,491 --> 01:38:42,510
through my notes.
I'm like,

2192
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:44,033
I'm a square.
I know when I was young I did meditate 

2193
01:38:46,501 --> 01:38:47,334
on purpose.
I stopped meditating for a long time 

2194
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:52,020
because I literally thought like when I 
was 21,

2195
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:54,090
22 fucking sucked.

2196
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:57,390
I sucked.
I mean,

2197
01:38:57,470 --> 01:38:59,470
it just wasn't very good.
We never.

2198
01:38:59,610 --> 01:39:00,730
But we got energy.
Yeah.

2199
01:39:00,930 --> 01:39:04,130
But I thought at the time that if I,
um,

2200
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:08,790
if I was moving toward enlightenment,
like if I was meditating,

2201
01:39:08,791 --> 01:39:11,520
the reason why I was meditating,
like when I was competing,

2202
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:12,953
I would meditate because it would try,
I would try to move towards a place of 

2203
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:18,780
like balance.
But then as a comedian I was like,

2204
01:39:18,781 --> 01:39:19,614
you probably shouldn't be balanced 
because the funny shit comes from the 

2205
01:39:23,071 --> 01:39:23,904
people like Richard Pryor,
these problems and it's kind of crazy 

2206
01:39:27,121 --> 01:39:31,680
and innocent and it was just crazy and 
doing all those are my heroes.

2207
01:39:31,681 --> 01:39:32,760
Yeah,
I know.

2208
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:35,700
But you know,
they're also not here anymore.

2209
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:37,380
Same thing.
Yeah.

2210
01:39:37,590 --> 01:39:38,520
Same thing,
you know?

2211
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:39,660
Yeah.
This is great.

2212
01:39:39,661 --> 01:39:41,160
People that are still around.
Fuck.

2213
01:39:41,161 --> 01:39:42,570
Yeah.
I think the best guys.

2214
01:39:42,630 --> 01:39:43,463
I really do.
I think right now between bill burr and 

2215
01:39:45,481 --> 01:39:46,930
Dave Chappelle,
Louis C,

2216
01:39:46,931 --> 01:39:48,840
k,
Chris Rock,

2217
01:39:49,050 --> 01:39:52,230
Joey Diaz,
there mean there's Tom Papa,

2218
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:54,510
Friday night in epics,
Friday night.

2219
01:39:54,710 --> 01:39:57,210
I was wondering when my pop and I lived 
there.

2220
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:58,753
I mean,
I think this is like honestly me and 

2221
01:40:00,691 --> 01:40:01,524
keep going.
There's a,

2222
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:04,800
there's a ton of like none of those guys
are funny comedians right now.

2223
01:40:04,830 --> 01:40:05,663
Yeah.
And none of them are really like super 

2224
01:40:07,801 --> 01:40:09,280
reckless.
No life,

2225
01:40:09,450 --> 01:40:10,980
no like Louise.
Not at all.

2226
01:40:11,790 --> 01:40:13,110
Not even a little bit.
No,

2227
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:15,240
no.
Bursa town disciplined.

2228
01:40:15,241 --> 01:40:16,140
Yeah.
Smart Guy.

2229
01:40:16,170 --> 01:40:19,880
Very a very um,
hard worker discipline.

2230
01:40:19,950 --> 01:40:22,680
Learning how to fly a helicopter and 
knows how it's going to license.

2231
01:40:22,710 --> 01:40:25,470
I know cooks.
It makes his own pie crust,

2232
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:28,590
like literally uses like shortening and 
stuff.

2233
01:40:28,710 --> 01:40:31,110
I brought him a,
one of my sourdough breads.

2234
01:40:31,290 --> 01:40:32,620
I brought him and uh,
his,

2235
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:34,190
his wife really wanted,
uh,

2236
01:40:34,250 --> 01:40:36,330
me to bring over his bread,
my bread.

2237
01:40:36,331 --> 01:40:37,020
So,
uh,

2238
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:40,020
I went and brought it over and gave it 
to her.

2239
01:40:40,021 --> 01:40:41,880
Of course they loved it because it's 
amazing.

2240
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:44,910
And uh,
right before Thanksgiving,

2241
01:40:44,911 --> 01:40:46,560
I think it was right before 
thanksgiving.

2242
01:40:47,010 --> 01:40:48,270
Yeah.
Maybe or that weekend.

2243
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:51,060
Uh,
he texted me and he's like,

2244
01:40:51,690 --> 01:40:52,410
dude,
can I,

2245
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:53,390
uh,
I,

2246
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:55,033
I want to drop off and he made this a 
traditional kind of like a kinda like a 

2247
01:41:01,541 --> 01:41:06,541
cinnamon and the apple kind of a bread 
and eat the bread testing Indian world.

2248
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:09,340
I think he was like,
you got bread.

2249
01:41:09,341 --> 01:41:11,350
I got bread,
I make bread.

2250
01:41:11,930 --> 01:41:16,120
And he brought it over to my house after
a set at the store and dropped it off.

2251
01:41:16,150 --> 01:41:16,983
It was a little raw inside.
He had a problem with is up and it 

2252
01:41:18,461 --> 01:41:19,720
wasn't a big deal,
but it was.

2253
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:21,070
Yeah,
he knows how to bake.

2254
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:24,550
That's amazing.
I love how you gave him the thumbs up.

2255
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:27,550
All right.
I'll tell you,

2256
01:41:27,551 --> 01:41:28,660
I'll try it out.
Oh,

2257
01:41:28,661 --> 01:41:31,750
except that he was a little pissed off 
that his wife liked my bread so much.

2258
01:41:31,990 --> 01:41:34,130
Just a feeling of expertise

2259
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:37,640
perhaps when you know they really know 
something you use.

2260
01:41:37,641 --> 01:41:40,160
Talk about bread,
like you just took on right there.

2261
01:41:40,161 --> 01:41:41,480
Were you describing his Braille

2262
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:42,773
bad?
Like you have an air of expertise when 

2263
01:41:45,921 --> 01:41:48,320
it comes to the area of bread?
Yeah,

2264
01:41:48,890 --> 01:41:50,490
I'm in deep.
I'm a deep.

2265
01:41:51,110 --> 01:41:53,830
I islet when I see you talk about,
uh,

2266
01:41:53,930 --> 01:41:56,510
doing your bow and Arrow thing.
That's what bread is for me.

2267
01:41:57,050 --> 01:42:01,940
It's this meditative small thing,
small moves to try and get better.

2268
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:05,380
I'm completely,
the rest of the world is out there and I

2269
01:42:05,381 --> 01:42:08,060
am in here working on this,
figuring this

2270
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:11,160
mystery out when it comes to like Bono 
stuff.

2271
01:42:11,161 --> 01:42:14,220
I'm like a good blue belt.
Right?

2272
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:17,280
But I'm not very.
There's bankers.

2273
01:42:17,281 --> 01:42:18,970
They're run circles around me,
but yeah,

2274
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:21,500
but you're in it just as much as that 
guy is.

2275
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:23,460
What's amazing about the bone Arrow 
world,

2276
01:42:23,490 --> 01:42:27,240
I would say the archery world is how 
much there is to know,

2277
01:42:27,420 --> 01:42:29,640
like you would never believe it.
It's endless,

2278
01:42:30,020 --> 01:42:31,500
right?
You would look at it and you go,

2279
01:42:31,501 --> 01:42:32,520
oh,
you pull the string back,

2280
01:42:32,521 --> 01:42:33,750
you aim,
you let the Arrow go.

2281
01:42:34,100 --> 01:42:35,640
And a lot of people that is what they 
think.

2282
01:42:35,641 --> 01:42:37,850
That is what it is.
But then you get into it and you,

2283
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:40,500
you understand like the physics behind 
these things,

2284
01:42:40,501 --> 01:42:45,501
the cams and the fucking limbs that pull
back on these compound bows and how it's

2285
01:42:46,951 --> 01:42:47,784
all measured and weighed and balanced 
and hoyt has to come out with a brand 

2286
01:42:52,051 --> 01:42:54,840
new better bow every year and you're 
crazy.

2287
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:59,490
These minor improvements of engineering,
these things are getting faster and more

2288
01:42:59,491 --> 01:43:04,491
powerful and it's all about figuring out
how to get a executed shot correctly.

2289
01:43:05,281 --> 01:43:06,114
Using your skeleton and holding 
everything perfect and having any 

2290
01:43:09,661 --> 01:43:12,240
influence on the flight of the Arrow.
It's like it's maddening.

2291
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:16,290
It would take you for a lifetime to 
master it and would you,

2292
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:17,880
could you.
You could.

2293
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:19,013
Could you imagine you got into it?
I think if there's nothing physically 

2294
01:43:21,841 --> 01:43:22,674
wrong with you.
I think bow and Arrow shooting archery 

2295
01:43:26,641 --> 01:43:31,641
is one of the more easy things on your 
body.

2296
01:43:32,190 --> 01:43:33,023
Like in terms of like you could be 
really good at it deep in your forties 

2297
01:43:35,611 --> 01:43:36,900
or fifties.
Like,

2298
01:43:36,901 --> 01:43:37,734
it's what I love about the reason I ask 
is the thing I love about this bread 

2299
01:43:41,491 --> 01:43:42,960
thing where you're talking about with 
that,

2300
01:43:42,961 --> 01:43:45,150
with standup,
it's

2301
01:43:45,770 --> 01:43:48,110
kind of unknowable.
You can get great at it,

2302
01:43:48,111 --> 01:43:48,944
you can be a master,
you can be one of the people that 

2303
01:43:49,881 --> 01:43:52,430
everyone looks at and says he's one of 
the guys

2304
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:55,010
and still it could be,
um,

2305
01:43:55,011 --> 01:43:58,970
that night or that moment or that pull 
it's out of your reach.

2306
01:43:59,030 --> 01:44:00,310
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

2307
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:04,070
I love that idea that you.
Because you know,

2308
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:06,050
you have something you can work on for 
the rest of your life.

2309
01:44:06,100 --> 01:44:08,120
Right.
You know what I mean?

2310
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:09,313
I'll get calls from seinfeld telling me 
he's completely lost with what he's 

2311
01:44:12,621 --> 01:44:15,230
doing with this set.
You know what I mean?

2312
01:44:15,370 --> 01:44:19,820
That's to me is comforting because 
that's what a craft is.

2313
01:44:19,821 --> 01:44:22,250
It's like I can,
I can get really great.

2314
01:44:22,251 --> 01:44:24,410
I can work so hard,
get really,

2315
01:44:24,411 --> 01:44:25,550
really,
really great.

2316
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,890
And then have a night where you're just 
off.

2317
01:44:28,530 --> 01:44:29,363
Yeah.
There's really no other way that you 

2318
01:44:31,101 --> 01:44:31,940
can.
Um,

2319
01:44:32,750 --> 01:44:37,390
I mean,
just like for a guy like Seinfeld that's

2320
01:44:37,391 --> 01:44:42,391
so successful and is made so many 
fucking standup specials,

2321
01:44:42,561 --> 01:44:43,820
how many specialists does he have?

2322
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:45,830
Not that many.
Actually.

2323
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:48,410
He's actually at least three.
Yeah,

2324
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:49,370
four.
Yeah,

2325
01:44:49,370 --> 01:44:51,080
three.
Probably three big ones.

2326
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:53,810
So he's at least put thousands.
I mean,

2327
01:44:54,110 --> 01:44:55,570
so many,
uh,

2328
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:58,220
uh,
late night performances.

2329
01:44:58,250 --> 01:44:59,630
Right?
Oh,

2330
01:44:59,750 --> 01:45:00,770
that's right,
that's right.

2331
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,510
There's a lot of those,
like several,

2332
01:45:02,511 --> 01:45:03,344
a year for 40 years.
And then in between that you put in the 

2333
01:45:07,971 --> 01:45:08,804
show Seinfeld,
which probably took almost all of his 

2334
01:45:11,811 --> 01:45:12,644
time.
Like he wasn't doing that much standup 

2335
01:45:13,610 --> 01:45:16,790
while he was doing that in the summers.
He would go tour in the summer,

2336
01:45:16,850 --> 01:45:21,780
but because that's a brutal Gig,
putting together a giant hit sitcom like

2337
01:45:21,790 --> 01:45:23,630
Seinfeld,
that must've been a brutal gig.

2338
01:45:23,631 --> 01:45:25,620
He talks about it like he went to war or
something.

2339
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:32,690
But the point is that guy that he,
that he has to still go through the same

2340
01:45:32,691 --> 01:45:34,730
process,
the same exact.

2341
01:45:35,390 --> 01:45:36,223
I just talked to him this morning and 
all we talked about was how are you 

2342
01:45:38,661 --> 01:45:39,650
writing?
Are you writing?

2343
01:45:39,651 --> 01:45:40,850
What are you doing?
When are you writing?

2344
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,410
Are you writing?
You're doing it late,

2345
01:45:42,411 --> 01:45:43,244
you're doing it early.
Doing it here and I'm trying to get it 

2346
01:45:45,111 --> 01:45:47,410
in an hour here.
Even if I sit and it was just an.

2347
01:45:47,630 --> 01:45:51,140
All that stuff was still 40 years in.
That's awesome.

2348
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:52,190
Yeah,
it's the best.

2349
01:45:52,191 --> 01:45:55,070
That's what all that stuff is.
It's so awesome.

2350
01:45:55,310 --> 01:45:56,810
Yeah.
That's what the,

2351
01:45:56,811 --> 01:45:57,950
uh,
the only,

2352
01:45:58,010 --> 01:45:58,843
the only advantage I would say that the 
bread thing has over the bow and Arrow 

2353
01:46:02,031 --> 01:46:04,020
thing is I get to eat it.
Hm.

2354
01:46:04,580 --> 01:46:06,650
Good point.
You could eat elk though.

2355
01:46:07,190 --> 01:46:10,080
You can,
you can take a lot.

2356
01:46:10,130 --> 01:46:10,963
It takes a lot.

2357
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:12,680
A lot of work.
Yeah.

2358
01:46:12,770 --> 01:46:15,650
If you want to get an elk or anything,
it takes a lot of work,

2359
01:46:16,030 --> 01:46:18,470
but I guess it takes a lot of work to 
learn how to bake bread,

2360
01:46:18,471 --> 01:46:21,320
but it's a different kind of work.
It's different,

2361
01:46:21,321 --> 01:46:24,470
but there's all of this.
I mean there's a whole nother level that

2362
01:46:24,471 --> 01:46:25,304
I am not even sure of the Ph balance,
the humidity in the house that the 

2363
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:32,053
temperature,
all of this stuff that's got it dialed 

2364
01:46:34,161 --> 01:46:34,994
in.
Is there like one bread where it's like 

2365
01:46:36,131 --> 01:46:36,964
the,
like if you wanted to get a bow you 

2366
01:46:38,901 --> 01:46:42,290
would get a hoyt fizzer one bread that 
has like a,

2367
01:46:42,530 --> 01:46:44,630
there's so many.
Like when I literally,

2368
01:46:44,631 --> 01:46:48,140
when I'm on the road I'll go check out 
these bakeries and like just go see what

2369
01:46:48,141 --> 01:46:49,410
kind of bread they're making and see 
what,

2370
01:46:49,530 --> 01:46:51,000
who's doing what in this town.

2371
01:46:51,570 --> 01:46:56,040
And uh,
there's a place in Venice down by a day.

2372
01:46:56,041 --> 01:46:57,810
The Rolls Royce.
Yeah.

2373
01:46:57,811 --> 01:46:58,320
But it's,
you know,

2374
01:46:58,320 --> 01:46:59,820
they're kind of.
Yeah.

2375
01:47:00,090 --> 01:47:01,560
The Rolls Royce of bread.
Yeah.

2376
01:47:01,561 --> 01:47:03,540
For this area.
They're the Rolls Royce.

2377
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:07,250
What's the name of the place?
It's called a Gusto.

2378
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,000
Jay.
I don't know how you pronounce it.

2379
01:47:09,001 --> 01:47:10,680
It's j.
g u,

2380
01:47:10,681 --> 01:47:15,360
s t o or j Dot j dot.
It's like Gusto.

2381
01:47:15,361 --> 01:47:17,150
I call it cousteau.
Jake,

2382
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:19,410
you walk in this place.
It's right by Gold's gym.

2383
01:47:19,411 --> 01:47:21,990
You know where Gold's gym is down there.
It's right there.

2384
01:47:21,991 --> 01:47:24,570
Like in this little shabby place I 
worked out there.

2385
01:47:24,571 --> 01:47:26,740
Wants Brow.
I'd imagine.

2386
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:29,030
I'd imagine bro cut in there,
Bro.

2387
01:47:29,031 --> 01:47:30,240
It was a good one bro.
Yeah,

2388
01:47:30,241 --> 01:47:31,074
Bro.
Yeah Bro.

2389
01:47:31,130 --> 01:47:32,430
Got a good lifting.
Nice,

2390
01:47:32,431 --> 01:47:34,200
Bro.
A lot of big dudes there,

2391
01:47:34,201 --> 01:47:35,280
Bro.
Big dudes,

2392
01:47:35,281 --> 01:47:36,114
Bro.

2393
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,100
You walk over there to that bread.
There's like this.

2394
01:47:41,420 --> 01:47:45,720
It's like this down and dirty and they 
make these lows of rather just insane.

2395
01:47:45,780 --> 01:47:46,613
Like I brought that home.
I'm a hero in my family for making I 

2396
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:51,223
bake bread and leave the to go on the 
road and just make sure that they have 

2397
01:47:53,851 --> 01:47:56,250
their breadwinner there.
Everybody's very happy.

2398
01:47:56,251 --> 01:47:58,350
I brought this blow phone.
My daughter was like,

2399
01:47:58,380 --> 01:48:01,980
why don't you do this?
I don't even make it like this.

2400
01:48:02,050 --> 01:48:03,450
That's dark.
I have no idea.

2401
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:07,020
There it is right there.
Hamp Nori.

2402
01:48:07,700 --> 01:48:09,330
Yeah.
Look at that.

2403
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:11,250
Look at that.
Damn good.

2404
01:48:11,390 --> 01:48:13,200
Yeah,
that is.

2405
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:15,480
Now I get it.
I get it now.

2406
01:48:15,481 --> 01:48:17,760
So that's a piece of art.
That's a piece of art.

2407
01:48:17,761 --> 01:48:20,040
It's an edible piece of art like they've
crafted.

2408
01:48:20,041 --> 01:48:20,874
It's a very appealing in the outside.
It looks very rustic and it's formed 

2409
01:48:24,630 --> 01:48:27,000
like they put the little slashes in it 
when they were baking it,

2410
01:48:27,001 --> 01:48:28,680
so it has layers to it.

2411
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:30,780
I watched this girl,
she was in the back.

2412
01:48:30,781 --> 01:48:34,950
You could see them working and doing all
this stuff and this girl was back there.

2413
01:48:34,980 --> 01:48:38,880
She's beaten this thing of dough with a 
pin.

2414
01:48:39,210 --> 01:48:40,043
I was like,
maybe I could work here for a little 

2415
01:48:40,831 --> 01:48:41,664
while.
Maybe I could just work here for like a 

2416
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:47,070
couple months and just as an apprentice,
like for free.

2417
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:49,920
Let me just figure out what the hell 
they're doing.

2418
01:48:50,090 --> 01:48:52,410
It literally is to a level.
I don't know what they're doing.

2419
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:57,300
That's a seeds.
It's a nine grain porridge loaf.

2420
01:48:57,630 --> 01:48:58,500
Yeah.
What the hell?

2421
01:48:58,530 --> 01:49:00,600
Whoa.
That's all seeds.

2422
01:49:00,660 --> 01:49:03,690
You're putting seeds on it.
Are you not into seeds?

2423
01:49:03,710 --> 01:49:08,090
I like succeeds guy.
My family doesn't eat seeds well.

2424
01:49:08,130 --> 01:49:10,470
My daughters will be like,
leaves a seed on it.

2425
01:49:10,490 --> 01:49:12,210
Don't like it.
What about poppy seed?

2426
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:15,030
How could you not like poppy seed bagels
for the best.

2427
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:17,520
What does that guy holding a bunch of 
them.

2428
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:19,470
You look at that guy.
Oh my goodness.

2429
01:49:19,471 --> 01:49:20,850
That looks good.
Look at those.

2430
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:23,220
Oh my God.
We're talking about bread folks.

2431
01:49:23,221 --> 01:49:24,870
I don't know how.
I don't know how.

2432
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:28,320
If it's the check,
the they're changing up the flower or if

2433
01:49:28,321 --> 01:49:30,480
it's the intensity,
like to get that dark,

2434
01:49:30,481 --> 01:49:33,120
you have to have a really high heat and 
beyond it.

2435
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:35,820
I don't know if like my conventional 
stove could do it.

2436
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:37,073
Yeah.
What they're doing is almost like 

2437
01:49:37,921 --> 01:49:42,921
burning it on the outside almost or at 
the door or burning it almost.

2438
01:49:43,950 --> 01:49:44,531
See,
it's hard.

2439
01:49:44,531 --> 01:49:48,760
The contrast in this is hard to tell 
because we might just be looking at some

2440
01:49:48,761 --> 01:49:52,630
weird shadows where the loaf in the back
looks like it's pretty burnt and the one

2441
01:49:52,631 --> 01:49:53,630
in the front looks burnt.
That's.

2442
01:49:53,640 --> 01:49:55,810
I'd like to see what it actually looks 
like in the flesh,

2443
01:49:55,811 --> 01:49:56,050
but.

2444
01:49:56,050 --> 01:49:56,890
Oh,
it's so good.

2445
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:01,130
It is dark,
which means I don't think it's looked at

2446
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:01,691
bats.
No.

2447
01:50:01,691 --> 01:50:03,710
Let me ask you this,
how spongy that is though.

2448
01:50:03,711 --> 01:50:06,760
It's really good.
We're looking at the site people like,

2449
01:50:06,761 --> 01:50:07,594
what the fuck are they looking at?
We're looking at the side profile of 

2450
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:12,750
these little holes in it.
Yeah.

2451
01:50:13,060 --> 01:50:13,893
Let me ask you this.
It's called the crumb butter or no 

2452
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:17,980
butter.
Um,

2453
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:20,710
I don't.
Uh,

2454
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:24,130
I don't.
I fucking knew it.

2455
01:50:24,610 --> 01:50:27,130
You don't use butter.
I like butter.

2456
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:30,190
How dare you?
If you liked butter,

2457
01:50:30,191 --> 01:50:33,400
you'd like butter on bread.
Say That's where it sits best.

2458
01:50:33,401 --> 01:50:34,234
I know,
but there's this butter does its best 

2459
01:50:35,591 --> 01:50:37,690
work is this other stuff?
That's pretty good too.

2460
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:39,700
So anytime time we're butter you allow 
it to be cold.

2461
01:50:40,170 --> 01:50:41,003
Huh?
So the only time where you allow your 

2462
01:50:42,101 --> 01:50:45,370
butter to be cold and you spread your 
butter on a loaf of bread.

2463
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:46,233
Yeah,
that's when you don't mind the cold 

2464
01:50:47,081 --> 01:50:48,250
butter.
Martha Stewart.

2465
01:50:48,251 --> 01:50:50,950
Tell me you shouldn't leave your bread.
Your butter out on the counter.

2466
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:51,873
Oh yeah.
Tell Martha Stewart you shouldn't 

2467
01:50:52,721 --> 01:50:57,721
fucking cheat on your taxes.
It's my girlfriend actually.

2468
01:50:59,381 --> 01:51:01,240
She inside traded.
I was wrong.

2469
01:51:01,410 --> 01:51:02,870
So insider trading.
Yeah.

2470
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:04,660
She got a little tip.
I'm sorry.

2471
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:06,190
She got a tip.
How does that work,

2472
01:51:06,191 --> 01:51:08,530
man?
Are you supposed to not respond to tips?

2473
01:51:08,980 --> 01:51:11,320
Everybody responds to tips.
They're all doing it.

2474
01:51:11,710 --> 01:51:12,590
They are.
I don't know.

2475
01:51:12,660 --> 01:51:14,740
I think they're all insider trading.
Of course.

2476
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:15,673
Like to get them some of your bread.
Wouldn't you think these guys gave me 

2477
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:19,930
some bread?
If you give me a tip,

2478
01:51:22,110 --> 01:51:25,210
I'll get you a nice,
nice sour dill.

2479
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:27,730
If I got a tip,
I'd be like,

2480
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:29,490
look dude,
we have a big tip.

2481
01:51:29,910 --> 01:51:30,743
Might explain this to me,
but please do again because I'm 

2482
01:51:32,471 --> 01:51:33,304
retarded.
Why is a sourdough have that flavor and 

2483
01:51:37,871 --> 01:51:38,704
why it.
Someone said that it's like it's almost 

2484
01:51:41,111 --> 01:51:41,944
gluten free,
that it's like it's not the same as 

2485
01:51:44,081 --> 01:51:45,310
regular bread.
Is that true?

2486
01:51:45,370 --> 01:51:48,410
It is true and I don't really know the 
science behind it,

2487
01:51:48,450 --> 01:51:50,500
but just giving it to friends.
I don't know,

2488
01:51:50,501 --> 01:51:51,334
but I've given it to friends that have 
gluten intolerant problem and they they 

2489
01:51:55,301 --> 01:51:57,880
are able to digest it a lot easier.
Tom Papa,

2490
01:51:57,881 --> 01:51:59,320
using his friends,
his Guinea pigs here.

2491
01:51:59,321 --> 01:52:00,520
Let's see if you shake yourself.

2492
01:52:03,230 --> 01:52:06,520
Have some gluten free bread crumbs.
Just eat it.

2493
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:12,220
If you ask for gluten free at this place
where they spit in your face.

2494
01:52:12,690 --> 01:52:14,490
Good Americans.
I don't know.

2495
01:52:14,550 --> 01:52:16,000
Probably.
I don't know.

2496
01:52:16,001 --> 01:52:17,200
I don't know.
They are in Venice.

2497
01:52:17,201 --> 01:52:18,340
They probably.
I don't know.

2498
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:20,230
Listen to me folks.
Bread is bad for you.

2499
01:52:20,260 --> 01:52:25,260
It's not make the best bad for you.
Do the best you can taste the best while

2500
01:52:25,811 --> 01:52:27,310
it's bad for you.
It's so good.

2501
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:31,030
If that's the one car,
the fermentation time,

2502
01:52:32,330 --> 01:52:36,910
the bacteria that builds up stops or 
breaks down the gluten proteins.

2503
01:52:36,970 --> 01:52:37,803
That's interesting.
So you need gluten for the structure of 

2504
01:52:39,701 --> 01:52:41,440
the bread.
So it still has gluten.

2505
01:52:41,610 --> 01:52:43,130
Oh,
so it does have some glute.

2506
01:52:43,131 --> 01:52:43,964
Yeah,
because that's the framework that's 

2507
01:52:44,351 --> 01:52:46,550
making it big.
If you don't eat the crust,

2508
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:48,560
maybe you don't get the gluten.
No,

2509
01:52:48,561 --> 01:52:51,330
it's in there.
It's in there.

2510
01:52:51,830 --> 01:52:54,830
Interesting to do science,
but there might be some other stuff.

2511
01:52:54,831 --> 01:52:55,664
I mean,
I think the problem really my just gut 

2512
01:52:58,100 --> 01:53:01,100
instinct is that when you're eating all 
this gluten with other stuff,

2513
01:53:01,430 --> 01:53:02,263
it's so much other stuff added in there 
that maybe interacting with the gluten 

2514
01:53:06,411 --> 01:53:09,860
that's made giving you the problem.
This bread has three ingredients.

2515
01:53:09,890 --> 01:53:14,270
You sound like an apologist and water,
flour and salt.

2516
01:53:14,271 --> 01:53:15,104
That's it.
So you're not getting all this extra 

2517
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:18,853
additives and stuff that are in there.
I think that's what's giving people 

2518
01:53:21,531 --> 01:53:22,364
really the problem.
So you think like preservatives and 

2519
01:53:23,841 --> 01:53:27,620
bread that like commercial bakeries use 
32 ingredients.

2520
01:53:28,460 --> 01:53:31,040
Ingredients are they,
you can't even pronounce them.

2521
01:53:31,130 --> 01:53:34,670
Oh,
you mean know what makes you make a good

2522
01:53:34,671 --> 01:53:35,504
point?
The FDA had to change the definition of 

2523
01:53:37,401 --> 01:53:41,630
what bread was,
so they could deal with these commercial

2524
01:53:41,631 --> 01:53:42,780
breads.
That's not healing.

2525
01:53:42,830 --> 01:53:43,663
Yeah,
that's not really technically what a 

2526
01:53:44,691 --> 01:53:45,260
bread is.

2527
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:47,840
If you add all this other stuff,
it's not really bread.

2528
01:53:47,870 --> 01:53:49,850
Okay,
so like what is wonder bread?

2529
01:53:50,550 --> 01:53:51,980
A whole lodge.
Delicious.

2530
01:53:51,981 --> 01:53:53,690
A whole bunch of fun.
Oh,

2531
01:53:53,691 --> 01:53:55,010
look at this.
Take wonder bread.

2532
01:53:55,011 --> 01:53:56,210
Oh my God.
And it's popular.

2533
01:53:56,211 --> 01:53:59,030
Wonder plus white loaf with fiber 
ingredients,

2534
01:53:59,031 --> 01:54:00,740
unbleached wheat flour,
water,

2535
01:54:00,741 --> 01:54:02,900
sugar,
haul fiber,

2536
01:54:02,901 --> 01:54:05,450
yeast,
soybean and canola oil,

2537
01:54:05,451 --> 01:54:06,171
wheat,
gluten,

2538
01:54:06,171 --> 01:54:07,790
salt,
natural soy flavor,

2539
01:54:07,850 --> 01:54:10,220
sour flavor rather,
bacterial culture,

2540
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:13,850
soy flour,
cultured wheat starch solids,

2541
01:54:13,910 --> 01:54:15,980
vinegar,
soy lecithin.

2542
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:18,170
Uh Huh.
Hm.

2543
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:19,910
It says,
look at this.

2544
01:54:19,910 --> 01:54:22,490
Wonder bread.
Not Wonderful for your health.

2545
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:26,260
The naked label.
Why not just make an article called de?

2546
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:29,060
It's so fucked.
Things wonder,

2547
01:54:29,061 --> 01:54:30,800
bread's good for you.
Like that's like saying,

2548
01:54:30,801 --> 01:54:32,450
hey kids,
if you drink you'll get drunk.

2549
01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:37,040
High Fructose Corn Syrup,
wheat gluten.

2550
01:54:37,550 --> 01:54:41,510
Look at this last [inaudible] sulfate 
dough conditioners.

2551
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:46,540
Sodium sterile,
loyal accolade x soul oxalated.

2552
01:54:47,330 --> 01:54:50,790
Yeah.
With mono and diglycerides look,

2553
01:54:50,950 --> 01:54:51,783
look at this.

2554
01:54:52,370 --> 01:54:53,203
Go back to just that one might,
may or may not have actually been 

2555
01:54:55,221 --> 01:54:56,090
wondering,
but it wasn't.

2556
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:57,033
Well,
what is it says wonder bread 

2557
01:54:58,911 --> 01:55:00,840
ingredients.
So let's keep fucking lying then.

2558
01:55:01,950 --> 01:55:05,270
This fake news is fake news.
Ammonium chloride,

2559
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:06,490
W,
where do we stop your.

2560
01:55:06,491 --> 01:55:07,324
Oh,
calcium dioxide and slash or as old die 

2561
01:55:10,390 --> 01:55:13,430
carbon.
Um,

2562
01:55:14,110 --> 01:55:19,110
but now I'm gonna Jesus Christ.
This ammonium chloride.

2563
01:55:19,490 --> 01:55:24,350
Ammonium sulfate and or Amano.
Calcium phosphate.

2564
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:28,910
Calcium propynate.
Innate ammonium sulfate.

2565
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:31,910
Ammonium in your bread.
Jimmy.

2566
01:55:31,911 --> 01:55:33,140
You must find that.
If that's real,

2567
01:55:33,141 --> 01:55:34,910
now you have perplexed.
I have to pee.

2568
01:55:34,940 --> 01:55:35,601
Can I pay?
Yeah,

2569
01:55:35,601 --> 01:55:36,434
please.
We'll just keep reading the ingredients 

2570
01:55:37,851 --> 01:55:39,620
for right off the bag.
Okay.

2571
01:55:39,621 --> 01:55:41,960
Right off the combine.
So it's all those things.

2572
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:44,190
That was all those things we were just 
talking about.

2573
01:55:44,850 --> 01:55:47,070
So all that stuff really is in there.
Wow.

2574
01:55:47,071 --> 01:55:50,880
That's nuts.
It's I guess,

2575
01:55:52,830 --> 01:55:53,940
boy,
you know,

2576
01:55:53,941 --> 01:55:54,774
you run into that thing where you say,
well if you want to have bread on the 

2577
01:55:57,511 --> 01:56:00,570
shelves in places where they're not 
growing any food,

2578
01:56:01,290 --> 01:56:04,620
like in order for it to be fresh enough 
for you to eat and not get sick,

2579
01:56:05,150 --> 01:56:07,710
you got to have some sort of 
preservatives in the bread.

2580
01:56:09,020 --> 01:56:09,853
Just like would one.
I would like to know definitively how 

2581
01:56:14,011 --> 01:56:16,470
much those preservatives have an effect 
on your health.

2582
01:56:16,780 --> 01:56:17,613
You know,
like everybody assumes they're really 

2583
01:56:18,451 --> 01:56:19,320
bad for you.
Right?

2584
01:56:19,620 --> 01:56:21,030
Don't you assume they're really bad for 
you?

2585
01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:22,373
I do too.
I would like to know what the fuck they 

2586
01:56:24,571 --> 01:56:28,110
do because what they're doing is they're
not allowing bacterial growth.

2587
01:56:28,111 --> 01:56:29,820
Right.
That sort of preservative is.

2588
01:56:30,030 --> 01:56:33,210
So if you have a loaf of bread and you 
put preservatives in it,

2589
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:34,103
it's stunting bacterial growth,
which will eventually take over and you 

2590
01:56:36,601 --> 01:56:37,800
brought your bread will get moldy.

2591
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:39,450
Right.
So that's a,

2592
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:40,313
that's a poison.
So you've got some sort of a poison on 

2593
01:56:42,841 --> 01:56:43,650
your bread.
Yeah.

2594
01:56:43,650 --> 01:56:45,660
It keeps it from being edible.
The bacteria.

2595
01:56:45,661 --> 01:56:47,880
So instead of eating bread while it's 
fresh,

2596
01:56:48,030 --> 01:56:48,863
when you're supposed to eat it,
the only time you're supposed to lead 

2597
01:56:50,311 --> 01:56:51,144
it,
you've got some chemicals pumped into 

2598
01:56:52,441 --> 01:56:54,390
it.
What's that doing to your body?

2599
01:56:54,450 --> 01:56:56,280
Exactly messing it up.
I mean,

2600
01:56:56,370 --> 01:56:57,203
what do you think?
It's doing,

2601
01:56:58,260 --> 01:56:59,093
what it's doing physically to your body.
It's probably making it difficult to 

2602
01:57:01,921 --> 01:57:02,754
digest things.
You're probably not transferring real 

2603
01:57:05,161 --> 01:57:05,994
food into this nutrients that you need.
Your system's going to work on this 

2604
01:57:09,181 --> 01:57:09,601
thing,
right?

2605
01:57:09,601 --> 01:57:10,434
Anything you put in your body,
your body seems to react right and deal 

2606
01:57:13,531 --> 01:57:14,364
with it has to deal with it.
It's probably dealing with that and not 

2607
01:57:17,260 --> 01:57:21,150
slowing down some other processes.
That's bro Science for you.

2608
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:22,133
But I bet your bro Science makes lot of 
sense and I also bet your bro Science 

2609
01:57:24,811 --> 01:57:26,070
could point to that.

2610
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:28,770
If you're taking in these things that 
are anti,

2611
01:57:28,930 --> 01:57:29,763
they essentially they stunt.
This is again super pro science there 

2612
01:57:32,940 --> 01:57:37,740
stunting these microbes growing on bread
and mold growing on bread,

2613
01:57:37,980 --> 01:57:40,240
but you have a bunch of gut flora 
[inaudible].

2614
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:43,740
So if you take that stuff and you put it
inside your gut,

2615
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:48,220
your gut flora has to be dealing with at
least some of that interest.

2616
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:49,073
How much is left,
how much of the preservative is in the 

2617
01:57:50,311 --> 01:57:52,560
bread while your body's trying to break 
it down?

2618
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:56,640
Where this gut flora is used to 
digesting organic material,

2619
01:57:56,850 --> 01:58:00,720
now it's dealing with sodium lauryl icon
of fucking plastic,

2620
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:02,730
right?
Calla fragile listic.

2621
01:58:02,850 --> 01:58:03,683
It's probably taking out some of the 
stuff that you need to fight off other 

2622
01:58:05,551 --> 01:58:06,384
stuff and you're percent man.
That's why antibiotics are so bad for 

2623
01:58:09,331 --> 01:58:11,160
you.
Not because they don't cure diseases,

2624
01:58:11,161 --> 01:58:11,994
they definitely do,
but because they also wreck your whole 

2625
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:15,293
biome,
like you have to take a bunch of 

2626
01:58:16,741 --> 01:58:20,280
probiotics and try and get your system 
back to operating.

2627
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:21,353
People have sometimes problems for quite
a long time after operations because of 

2628
01:58:24,991 --> 01:58:26,760
the probiotics,
the probiotics,

2629
01:58:26,761 --> 01:58:29,430
which are important to keep you from 
getting infections,

2630
01:58:29,431 --> 01:58:32,030
but they're not without a price like 
your.

2631
01:58:32,031 --> 01:58:34,230
Your body pays a price for that.
I mean,

2632
01:58:34,740 --> 01:58:35,573
look,
there's been times when you walk in and 

2633
01:58:37,531 --> 01:58:38,460
you're like,
you had a bread,

2634
01:58:38,461 --> 01:58:39,294
like a,
an Italian bread that you bought this 

2635
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:42,160
from the supermarket and you're like,
three days

2636
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:42,821
later you're like,
oh,

2637
01:58:42,821 --> 01:58:44,700
this is probably no soft.
I could eat,

2638
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,680
I could eat.
This is like a week later.

2639
01:58:47,681 --> 01:58:49,000
It's like,
that's not good.

2640
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:51,490
How long is a loaf of bread supposed to 
last?

2641
01:58:51,700 --> 01:58:52,533
If when you cut it,
it should start getting hard 

2642
01:58:55,211 --> 01:58:58,380
immediately.
Really like by the next day like that.

2643
01:58:58,500 --> 01:58:59,333
That part,
that part that you've cut to expose the 

2644
01:59:01,181 --> 01:59:02,850
stuff that's under the crust,
you know,

2645
01:59:03,030 --> 01:59:04,310
it could last for,
you know,

2646
01:59:04,370 --> 01:59:05,620
three days,
four days.

2647
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:09,400
My grandfather lived in a hard though,
an Italian neighborhood.

2648
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:11,500
All Italian neighborhood in North New 
Jersey.

2649
01:59:11,590 --> 01:59:14,080
Oh Nice.
And when I was a little kid,

2650
01:59:14,860 --> 01:59:18,220
we used to go to the bread store.
He used to go to the bakery,

2651
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:19,533
to the bakery,
like every couple of days they would 

2652
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:24,100
have a loaf of bread.
It would sit on the kitchen table.

2653
01:59:24,310 --> 01:59:28,360
They would chop from the white paper 
wrapper and pull it out of the wrapper a

2654
01:59:28,361 --> 01:59:30,070
little bit,
cut some slices,

2655
01:59:30,071 --> 01:59:31,930
push it back in the wrapper,
Kinda roll it up,

2656
01:59:32,170 --> 01:59:34,030
but everybody knew it was good for a 
couple of days.

2657
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:38,110
Couple of days later my grandpa would go
down to the bakery and get it again,

2658
01:59:38,111 --> 01:59:38,944
and this same place had been in 
operation since the 19 twenties and 

2659
01:59:42,401 --> 01:59:43,810
stuff like that.
That's great.

2660
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:46,990
And it was just a cool little 
neighborhood bakery.

2661
01:59:47,050 --> 01:59:49,450
It's the vast.
And then till you would go,

2662
01:59:49,620 --> 01:59:51,460
you would do that with all your foods.
He would do.

2663
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:53,200
Then you go to the fruit guy and get 
that.

2664
01:59:53,201 --> 01:59:55,450
Then you get your meat from that guy and
it was all.

2665
01:59:55,960 --> 01:59:59,720
It wasn't all meant to last forever.
Yeah.

2666
01:59:59,790 --> 02:00:01,750
You know,
I think when I think about the time,

2667
02:00:01,751 --> 02:00:02,584
like we were talking about how hard it 
is to eat when you're on the road and 

2668
02:00:05,171 --> 02:00:07,360
like you know when you're pressed for 
time,

2669
02:00:07,390 --> 02:00:08,223
if you're running between obligations,
you have all these different things 

2670
02:00:10,931 --> 02:00:11,840
you're doing.
It's,

2671
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:13,960
it's hard to get good food in your 
system.

2672
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:15,130
It is,
you know,

2673
02:00:15,131 --> 02:00:15,790
that's.

2674
02:00:15,790 --> 02:00:20,140
I did this weekend and I was eating.
I ate horribly,

2675
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:21,033
I felt I was dragging all weekend.
I just was putting crap in my body in a 

2676
02:00:27,071 --> 02:00:30,520
pinch and a w.
It made it so hard.

2677
02:00:30,521 --> 02:00:31,870
Sometimes you're in a hotel and you're 
like,

2678
02:00:32,180 --> 02:00:33,810
is there a side vegetable?
Can I have a,

2679
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:36,610
just a site and they know.
And what do you mean?

2680
02:00:36,611 --> 02:00:39,130
No,
you don't have a vegetable for me.

2681
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:40,301
It's,
yeah,

2682
02:00:40,301 --> 02:00:42,520
it's really bad,
but that's why I'm,

2683
02:00:42,790 --> 02:00:47,320
I've made two loaves at a time and I 
literally have to go back to New York,

2684
02:00:47,321 --> 02:00:49,960
uh,
tomorrow and I just got in yesterday.

2685
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:50,853
So while I,
I got in fed the starter to get the 

2686
02:00:54,041 --> 02:00:57,520
bread going and now when I go home and 
then I made it into dough.

2687
02:00:57,521 --> 02:00:58,354
This morning it's rising now I'll go 
back and bake this bread and then 

2688
02:01:01,661 --> 02:01:04,060
they'll have bread for the week until I 
come back on Friday.

2689
02:01:04,120 --> 02:01:05,770
That's awesome.
That's my job.

2690
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:08,110
That's so cool.
It's my job at the house.

2691
02:01:08,710 --> 02:01:09,543
That's so nice because that's something 
they're going to think about you every 

2692
02:01:11,801 --> 02:01:14,020
time they eat your bread.
Daddy makes this.

2693
02:01:14,050 --> 02:01:14,883
It's funny because my kids will send me 
pictures of sourdough from when they're 

2694
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:19,570
like at a restaurant with your friends 
or something.

2695
02:01:19,571 --> 02:01:24,571
It'd be like not very good what I was 
going to get out though.

2696
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:28,713
When you're on the road and you're on 
the hustle and you're doing so many 

2697
02:01:30,521 --> 02:01:31,354
different things,
you don't have a chance to eat well and 

2698
02:01:32,681 --> 02:01:33,514
you definitely don't have the chance to 
like have a loaf of bread and take some 

2699
02:01:36,701 --> 02:01:40,230
slices out of it and then get loan and a
couple of days,

2700
02:01:40,230 --> 02:01:41,063
like most people that are way too busy.
But what I was going to get at is it's 

2701
02:01:43,561 --> 02:01:46,490
Kinda like what you were talking about 
before that could you downsize,

2702
02:01:46,750 --> 02:01:48,290
could you downsize,
and if you did,

2703
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:50,240
would you be happier?
You might be.

2704
02:01:50,450 --> 02:01:52,580
You might be happier if you did less 
stuff.

2705
02:01:52,581 --> 02:01:54,470
You might be happier if you calm down 
more.

2706
02:01:54,570 --> 02:01:55,403
Might be happier if you went and got 
bread every couple of days where you 

2707
02:01:57,231 --> 02:01:58,850
made your own bread every couple of 
days.

2708
02:01:59,690 --> 02:02:02,390
Whatever is keeping you.
I can't do that on too busy.

2709
02:02:02,510 --> 02:02:05,380
Whatever that is might be the problem.
Like we,

2710
02:02:05,540 --> 02:02:09,380
we might in our rush to be successful.
I think a lot of people.

2711
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:13,880
I think it's totally possible that you 
overshoot the happiness spot.

2712
02:02:14,140 --> 02:02:15,490
Yeah.
No,

2713
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:16,630
I know.
I mean,

2714
02:02:16,631 --> 02:02:17,464
look,
if,

2715
02:02:18,030 --> 02:02:23,030
if I,
if I was the Tom Papa that started stand

2716
02:02:23,031 --> 02:02:27,670
up for the first week and you'd showed 
me where I'm at now,

2717
02:02:28,450 --> 02:02:29,710
I would think,
oh,

2718
02:02:29,711 --> 02:02:34,711
pure bliss bliss and now I am where I 
am.

2719
02:02:35,441 --> 02:02:37,810
And I'm like,
I don't know.

2720
02:02:37,811 --> 02:02:39,520
I think that old guy might've been a 
little happier.

2721
02:02:41,130 --> 02:02:44,440
Piglet guy who's just doing a spot for 
five bucks at the comic strip.

2722
02:02:45,010 --> 02:02:47,700
That guy was pretty happy.
Especially.

2723
02:02:47,780 --> 02:02:47,940
Yeah.

2724
02:02:47,940 --> 02:02:50,940
Now when you know that you're going to 
wind up being successful.

2725
02:02:51,320 --> 02:02:52,153
Yeah.
That's the thing about like when the 

2726
02:02:53,461 --> 02:02:55,950
unknown is very stressful.
That's true.

2727
02:02:56,570 --> 02:02:59,550
At that time you were like,
am I ever going to get on Conan?

2728
02:02:59,610 --> 02:03:02,910
Yeah.
And we all know that one guy,

2729
02:03:02,911 --> 02:03:05,310
at least a few guys.
That was really funny,

2730
02:03:05,311 --> 02:03:07,260
but for some reason didn't catch on.
Yeah,

2731
02:03:07,650 --> 02:03:08,483
right.
Yeah.

2732
02:03:08,790 --> 02:03:09,623
I know there's a ton of those guys a ton
and so you'd always think about them 

2733
02:03:12,661 --> 02:03:14,430
like what about that guy?
Whatever happened to that guy.

2734
02:03:14,580 --> 02:03:15,413
Yeah.

2735
02:03:15,450 --> 02:03:16,283
No,
I know that.

2736
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:18,270
The wall of death at a comedy club and 
you're like,

2737
02:03:20,050 --> 02:03:21,270
all these people go,

2738
02:03:21,450 --> 02:03:25,290
yeah,
the store has got a fucking haunted wall

2739
02:03:25,490 --> 02:03:27,710
to wall.
Some of the wallet guys just stopped.

2740
02:03:27,711 --> 02:03:29,330
They just stopped doing it.
To us,

2741
02:03:29,331 --> 02:03:30,900
it's like someone.
One of the scariest things.

2742
02:03:30,901 --> 02:03:31,980
Right?
Terrifying.

2743
02:03:32,220 --> 02:03:33,053
So when you.
I think we have a romanticizing 

2744
02:03:35,190 --> 02:03:37,500
instinct.
The human,

2745
02:03:37,530 --> 02:03:38,363
the human animal does.
We have a gigantic instinct to go back 

2746
02:03:41,461 --> 02:03:42,990
to a time where shit made sense.

2747
02:03:43,070 --> 02:03:47,930
Make America great again.
Seriously is a novel thing.

2748
02:03:47,931 --> 02:03:49,700
Every girlfriend you were with was 
pretty good.

2749
02:03:50,300 --> 02:03:52,600
Everything you did was pretty great.
That little,

2750
02:03:52,630 --> 02:03:55,430
you know,
all his little crappy ways.

2751
02:03:55,431 --> 02:03:56,810
You spend your time.
That was her fun.

2752
02:03:57,700 --> 02:03:58,490
Yeah.
I don't know.

2753
02:03:58,490 --> 02:03:59,630
At the time you didn't think so.

2754
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:02,360
Probably so much.
You get in a fight with your girlfriend.

2755
02:04:02,630 --> 02:04:03,463
Think about your ex girlfriend.
She wouldn't have talked to me like 

2756
02:04:05,511 --> 02:04:06,010
that.

2757
02:04:06,010 --> 02:04:07,480
It's because it's knowable,
right?

2758
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:09,910
Like the future is unknowable.
So scary.

2759
02:04:10,270 --> 02:04:13,150
This change that the country was going 
under.

2760
02:04:13,151 --> 02:04:15,350
Like what do you mean there's these jobs
are going away.

2761
02:04:15,351 --> 02:04:16,184
What do you mean we're going into soon?
What do you mean we've got to deal with 

2762
02:04:17,741 --> 02:04:18,840
India.
What do you mean?

2763
02:04:18,910 --> 02:04:21,850
Technology's taking over my life.
That's scary.

2764
02:04:22,390 --> 02:04:27,390
No picket fence where it go.
When I get my bread and go perched on my

2765
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:30,280
desk.
That's noble.

2766
02:04:30,281 --> 02:04:31,640
It's feels safer.
Or

2767
02:04:31,750 --> 02:04:34,300
You could break it down to an MAG.
A Mag,

2768
02:04:34,301 --> 02:04:36,640
a Hashtag.
Maga.

2769
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:37,853
Faggots

2770
02:04:40,900 --> 02:04:43,150
becomes.
If you can't,

2771
02:04:43,260 --> 02:04:45,450
it's just a grunt type in a word.
Well,

2772
02:04:45,690 --> 02:04:48,000
whether whether he represents that are 
not,

2773
02:04:48,060 --> 02:04:50,940
there can be no doubt that he is the 
king of the assholes.

2774
02:04:51,330 --> 02:04:52,163
Like he figured out,
like he found people that are going to 

2775
02:04:56,251 --> 02:04:58,340
support him almost exclusively.
Yeah.

2776
02:04:58,430 --> 02:05:01,980
Like there's a lot of assholes.
If you could tap into them.

2777
02:05:02,190 --> 02:05:03,930
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.

2778
02:05:04,530 --> 02:05:07,440
You just got to the.
This is the first one that made sense to

2779
02:05:07,441 --> 02:05:08,274
them.
They were never politically active for 

2780
02:05:11,041 --> 02:05:11,874
Walter Mondale.
Assholes didn't step up for Ms Dot Mitt 

2781
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:16,050
Romney.
No,

2782
02:05:16,050 --> 02:05:16,883
but then trump came along and the dogs.
One of us boys going to make America 

2783
02:05:20,281 --> 02:05:22,470
great again.
US.

2784
02:05:22,770 --> 02:05:23,603
This man that lives in this billionaire 
and lives on the top of a tower in 

2785
02:05:27,061 --> 02:05:27,894
Manhattan is one of us.
I saw a really amazing dark video of 

2786
02:05:33,691 --> 02:05:34,860
this guy.
He,

2787
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:37,530
he got a traffic altercation with this 
black guy.

2788
02:05:37,530 --> 02:05:40,560
The black guy is holding the phone in.
The white guy comes up to the,

2789
02:05:40,610 --> 02:05:45,610
to the window and uh,
the one of the first thing he says,

2790
02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:47,310
he said,
trump all the way,

2791
02:05:47,311 --> 02:05:48,300
bro.
Trump.

2792
02:05:48,930 --> 02:05:49,980
Really?
He goes,

2793
02:05:50,070 --> 02:05:51,990
he goes,
you're telling me black lives matter.

2794
02:05:51,991 --> 02:05:54,750
He goes,
you can't say black lives matter.

2795
02:05:54,930 --> 02:05:56,910
You gotta.
Show me black lives matter.

2796
02:05:58,260 --> 02:06:00,600
Show me a reason because now you're just
saying it.

2797
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:02,720
He goes,
and you cut in front of me and you,

2798
02:06:02,721 --> 02:06:05,130
you sped up and cut in front of me.
That makes you a nigger.

2799
02:06:05,950 --> 02:06:08,910
He's filming him while this guy saying 
this.

2800
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:10,170
Oh.
And I'm like,

2801
02:06:10,171 --> 02:06:12,150
wow,
man.

2802
02:06:12,151 --> 02:06:14,310
Oh Man.
That attitude that,

2803
02:06:14,311 --> 02:06:16,380
like he said,
opens up with trump.

2804
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:19,200
He opens up.
It's no joke.

2805
02:06:19,530 --> 02:06:21,600
I'm not saying that everybody's a trump 
supporters like that.

2806
02:06:21,601 --> 02:06:24,780
What I am saying is that don't even look
that video up.

2807
02:06:24,780 --> 02:06:28,200
I don't want to get that guy in any more
trouble than I'm sure you're already in,

2808
02:06:28,470 --> 02:06:29,303
but to to that feeling now you can.
Dad Feeling is like you're only gonna 

2809
02:06:33,691 --> 02:06:34,524
attack that,
that specific type of feeling like 

2810
02:06:37,141 --> 02:06:39,360
that's a no.
You got to avoid that.

2811
02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:42,330
Whatever that pops up.
Like that's terrible.

2812
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:44,370
It's called hate.
Yeah,

2813
02:06:44,371 --> 02:06:45,920
well it's the.
The,

2814
02:06:45,940 --> 02:06:46,773
the angle that he went on it.
Look at these guys got into legitimate 

2815
02:06:48,841 --> 02:06:49,674
traffic altercation and that legitimate 
traffic altercation was because one guy 

2816
02:06:53,911 --> 02:06:57,120
hit his blinker too late or cut in front
of somebody or something like that.

2817
02:06:57,630 --> 02:07:00,810
If you're a fucking human being with any
decency,

2818
02:07:01,170 --> 02:07:06,170
you discuss what happened and maybe you 
fucked up and maybe you should apologize

2819
02:07:06,331 --> 02:07:09,150
and maybe he fucked up and maybe he will
apologize.

2820
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:10,193
Who knows?
But when you open up with trump all the 

2821
02:07:12,751 --> 02:07:13,650
way trump,
bro,

2822
02:07:13,710 --> 02:07:14,810
black lives matter,
you know,

2823
02:07:14,820 --> 02:07:15,900
you show me like,
what?

2824
02:07:16,050 --> 02:07:17,910
Where?
Where's your head at?

2825
02:07:18,140 --> 02:07:18,973
This is.
This is how you're communicating with 

2826
02:07:20,130 --> 02:07:21,220
the person.
Really tap.

2827
02:07:22,290 --> 02:07:25,550
He tapped into all degrees of that.
Yeah.

2828
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:29,550
All degrees of that.
When when people are being bombarded,

2829
02:07:29,551 --> 02:07:34,551
when white guys in Ohio who are going 
out trying to work as a construction

2830
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:41,400
worker and that guy has got three kids 
and he was told white men are over,

2831
02:07:42,790 --> 02:07:43,930
white men are done.
Right.

2832
02:07:43,931 --> 02:07:46,590
It was became like a trendy thing.
Anybody that it is,

2833
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:47,433
it's in all the media is just people 
saying white people had done white 

2834
02:07:49,841 --> 02:07:52,630
people are done with treatment.
Different sites.

2835
02:07:53,500 --> 02:07:55,450
You reading the white people were done 
websites.

2836
02:07:55,451 --> 02:07:57,070
Jamie.
I've seen people say that on twitter.

2837
02:07:57,071 --> 02:07:58,570
Yeah.
Even like having them post.

2838
02:07:58,600 --> 02:08:00,820
You go to black twitter though,
you're always on black.

2839
02:08:00,821 --> 02:08:04,990
Twitter even having imposed.
It's always about white males.

2840
02:08:05,050 --> 02:08:07,110
Oh,
another white male gets the job.

2841
02:08:07,180 --> 02:08:09,010
Either way you're going to say 
salon.com.

2842
02:08:09,011 --> 02:08:09,844
Next.
I'm saying that's a big thing and the 

2843
02:08:12,231 --> 02:08:17,020
people that guy who's being told that 
the jobs aren't for you.

2844
02:08:17,110 --> 02:08:18,520
Right?
It's where these other people,

2845
02:08:18,521 --> 02:08:19,354
that's what's coming,
but you're sitting there with your wife 

2846
02:08:20,651 --> 02:08:22,390
and two kids and you're like,
all right,

2847
02:08:22,450 --> 02:08:23,290
look,
I get it.

2848
02:08:23,290 --> 02:08:24,123
White guys had a good run.
You're saying white guys are kind of 

2849
02:08:26,180 --> 02:08:27,190
passe.
We're done,

2850
02:08:27,220 --> 02:08:28,053
but I got,
I got Christmas to pay for and they got 

2851
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:30,753
these I got,
but I think that's such an extreme 

2852
02:08:32,441 --> 02:08:34,420
perspective on it that why people are 
done.

2853
02:08:34,630 --> 02:08:35,463
I think the big perspective,
the much broader perspective on people 

2854
02:08:38,951 --> 02:08:39,784
that are trying to encourage diversity 
is that they feel like people are 

2855
02:08:42,220 --> 02:08:45,130
discriminated against in the past.
It's time to balance that out.

2856
02:08:45,131 --> 02:08:48,370
It doesn't mean that white people suck.
It just means that everybody's great,

2857
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:51,280
but that's ever bring them all in like 
that's the right way to look at it,

2858
02:08:51,540 --> 02:08:53,470
but you're going to have the extreme 
that go.

2859
02:08:53,471 --> 02:08:55,390
White people saw white people stand 
down.

2860
02:08:55,391 --> 02:08:57,730
White people should just shut the fuck 
up and let us talk now,

2861
02:08:58,180 --> 02:09:01,930
but that's always going to be the case.
You're always going to have fluctuations

2862
02:09:01,931 --> 02:09:04,750
inside of a good idea for sure,
but there's.

2863
02:09:04,900 --> 02:09:06,580
It resonated.
I think white,

2864
02:09:06,820 --> 02:09:07,653
white people.
I tell this is a the morning after the 

2865
02:09:11,261 --> 02:09:12,880
election,
morning after,

2866
02:09:12,881 --> 02:09:14,770
right?
That whole night of what the hell?

2867
02:09:14,771 --> 02:09:16,330
What's happened?
Who's what?

2868
02:09:17,860 --> 02:09:19,780
I get up in the morning and were like,
I have a new puppy.

2869
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:22,150
I take my puppy outside at 6:00
in the morning,

2870
02:09:22,151 --> 02:09:23,080
6:30
in the morning.

2871
02:09:23,081 --> 02:09:27,400
I'm outside with the dog and I here in 
the,

2872
02:09:28,050 --> 02:09:29,410
in the distance.
It's a quiet,

2873
02:09:29,770 --> 02:09:31,150
you know,
upscale neighborhood.

2874
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:31,560
I hear,

2875
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:32,393
Huh?
Yeah.

2876
02:09:32,610 --> 02:09:35,390
Can you believe it?
No Way Michael.

2877
02:09:35,780 --> 02:09:36,613
I'm like,
this has gotta be it's gotTa be about 

2878
02:09:38,301 --> 02:09:39,340
the election there.
So like,

2879
02:09:39,500 --> 02:09:41,390
I know I couldn't believe it happened 
either.

2880
02:09:41,990 --> 02:09:42,823
Peer through.
I go through the bushes and I see a 

2881
02:09:44,841 --> 02:09:46,880
white Mercedes.
It's a white Mercedes.

2882
02:09:47,030 --> 02:09:49,820
A guy's talking to another guy.
They're talking.

2883
02:09:49,821 --> 02:09:52,610
I can hardly understand what they're 
saying and as the guy leaves,

2884
02:09:53,090 --> 02:09:54,320
he's like,
all right man,

2885
02:09:54,321 --> 02:09:58,400
I'll see you soon.
White lives matter and takes off.

2886
02:09:58,550 --> 02:10:02,450
This is a guy doing well in a Mercedes 
living in this nice neighborhood.

2887
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:04,640
And that was the first thing I heard the
next morning.

2888
02:10:06,140 --> 02:10:07,700
There is a,
you can't,

2889
02:10:07,850 --> 02:10:11,360
you can't say that anybody else doesn't 
matter.

2890
02:10:11,420 --> 02:10:12,253
You can't put.
Make people feel like they don't exist 

2891
02:10:14,660 --> 02:10:15,493
because they,
they will fight back on all sides all 

2892
02:10:17,361 --> 02:10:19,100
the time.
That's a very good point.

2893
02:10:19,400 --> 02:10:21,650
And that's unfortunately with some 
people here,

2894
02:10:21,651 --> 02:10:24,500
like if you hear black lives matter,
were you here as well?

2895
02:10:24,590 --> 02:10:25,423
That means white lives don't or that 
means white lives do less or that means 

2896
02:10:29,780 --> 02:10:30,900
we're trying to call,
call,

2897
02:10:31,130 --> 02:10:34,040
call attention to one very specific 
only.

2898
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:34,933
Right.
And even though I completely understand 

2899
02:10:36,561 --> 02:10:37,394
why they're doing it,
I don't think there's anything wrong 

2900
02:10:38,391 --> 02:10:39,224
with black lives matter.
I don't think there's anything wrong 

2901
02:10:40,221 --> 02:10:41,054
with the idea of it.
But I think I didn't have this reaction 

2902
02:10:43,611 --> 02:10:45,680
to it.
But I know that some people probably did

2903
02:10:45,860 --> 02:10:46,910
they immediately go,
yeah.

2904
02:10:46,911 --> 02:10:50,540
What about what people just debts up 
fucking knee jerk or.

2905
02:10:50,750 --> 02:10:51,583
And that might not have had to happen.
Like I think sometimes ideas the way 

2906
02:10:56,511 --> 02:10:58,610
they're displayed,
like sometimes people,

2907
02:10:59,000 --> 02:10:59,833
they do it because it feels like the 
right thing to do at the time of the 

2908
02:11:02,391 --> 02:11:03,224
right way to say it at the time.
But anytime you're inviting any sort of 

2909
02:11:07,041 --> 02:11:07,874
like anger or dispute,
it feels like you want to do that to 

2910
02:11:10,551 --> 02:11:12,530
push back.
But that shit is going to come back this

2911
02:11:12,531 --> 02:11:14,720
way.
It's way easier said than done.

2912
02:11:15,620 --> 02:11:20,620
But I think that all a lot of what we 
see from this reaction to to anything,

2913
02:11:22,570 --> 02:11:25,400
it's like a aggressively progressive.

2914
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:28,700
Like people when they feel like they're 
pushed,

2915
02:11:28,970 --> 02:11:31,490
they're like,
you have to listen to the way we see the

2916
02:11:31,491 --> 02:11:34,310
world,
and then they want to go the fuck I do.

2917
02:11:34,590 --> 02:11:35,423
You know,
like they want to push back and almost 

2918
02:11:37,730 --> 02:11:40,280
ramp up,
doubled down on the racism,

2919
02:11:40,281 --> 02:11:44,180
doubled down on their xenophobia,
trying to correct wrongs.

2920
02:11:44,181 --> 02:11:45,014
That kid.
It could come off as being aggressive 

2921
02:11:46,791 --> 02:11:49,730
and bullying to those people.
Yeah.

2922
02:11:49,790 --> 02:11:52,410
Especially if you don't agree with them.
Like,

2923
02:11:53,150 --> 02:11:54,170
here's the thing,
man.

2924
02:11:54,530 --> 02:11:56,570
Everybody thinks they're right.
Whether it's you're on,

2925
02:11:56,630 --> 02:11:57,463
you're on the right or the left.
Everybody thinks they have a moral 

2926
02:11:59,121 --> 02:11:59,954
imperative.
Everybody thinks that they're doing the 

2927
02:12:00,861 --> 02:12:03,090
right thing unless your piece of shit.
Right,

2928
02:12:03,140 --> 02:12:03,973
right.
Let's assume people aren't for the most 

2929
02:12:05,451 --> 02:12:06,350
part,
are pieces of shit.

2930
02:12:06,380 --> 02:12:07,820
They think they're doing the right 
thing,

2931
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:12,380
but this is the way they've grown up.
There's just so much of it as cultural.

2932
02:12:12,770 --> 02:12:14,690
When you look at the world today,
we're,

2933
02:12:14,750 --> 02:12:15,583
we're all just human beings,
but there's people that are living in 

2934
02:12:18,111 --> 02:12:22,310
parts of the world that must behave a 
way different way than we are allowed to

2935
02:12:22,311 --> 02:12:23,144
behave because they're entrapped in a 
religious ideology that dominates their 

2936
02:12:26,541 --> 02:12:30,650
community,
so it could be these poor kids in Africa

2937
02:12:30,651 --> 02:12:31,484
that get that female genital mutilation,
like how many of them haven't done to 

2938
02:12:35,181 --> 02:12:36,014
them.
It could be that it could be growing up 

2939
02:12:38,080 --> 02:12:38,913
Mormon and Utah and a crazy fucking 
house filled with nutty mormons or you 

2940
02:12:42,651 --> 02:12:43,484
know,
there's a million different 

2941
02:12:44,180 --> 02:12:46,670
possibilities.
Roll the dice that you ended up there,

2942
02:12:46,700 --> 02:12:50,330
but apparently people are just super 
flexible.

2943
02:12:50,840 --> 02:12:51,673
Our behavior is really malleable and 
were adaptable and we can fit into 

2944
02:12:58,340 --> 02:13:01,160
whether it's a horrible ideology like 
what happened,

2945
02:13:03,170 --> 02:13:05,330
what happened in World War II,
what happened with the Nazis.

2946
02:13:05,810 --> 02:13:09,710
They fail into a horrible way of of 
living life,

2947
02:13:10,690 --> 02:13:14,720
but that's a possibility that's going on
right now in North Korea.

2948
02:13:14,930 --> 02:13:15,763
There's always a possibility for people 
to fit into these little weird little 

2949
02:13:19,371 --> 02:13:20,204
packages.
So if you see someone that has a weird 

2950
02:13:22,340 --> 02:13:24,950
package of existence that you don't jive
with,

2951
02:13:25,580 --> 02:13:29,540
you gotta look at it like what would you
do if you were them?

2952
02:13:29,790 --> 02:13:33,740
Like if you had their life and now 
you're looking at this from their but no

2953
02:13:33,741 --> 02:13:35,970
one from your perspective.
Try.

2954
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,850
If you can do imagine what it would be 
like to look at it from.

2955
02:13:38,860 --> 02:13:39,490
There's,

2956
02:13:39,490 --> 02:13:40,990
I mean,
it's so random it.

2957
02:13:41,260 --> 02:13:43,240
I mean,
especially like growing up here,

2958
02:13:43,300 --> 02:13:44,133
it's like you,
if you had been born just 200 miles 

2959
02:13:49,241 --> 02:13:52,060
south in Mexico,
your life is.

2960
02:13:52,090 --> 02:13:53,680
Oh,
totally different.

2961
02:13:53,740 --> 02:13:55,930
Totally.
So there's no like,

2962
02:13:55,990 --> 02:13:56,823
divine the,
it's just you just got lucky that your 

2963
02:13:59,231 --> 02:14:01,840
parents ended up a little north.
Yeah.

2964
02:14:01,841 --> 02:14:03,730
You know what I mean?
It's just,

2965
02:14:03,731 --> 02:14:04,990
it's,
it's really,

2966
02:14:04,991 --> 02:14:06,520
uh,
it's really unsettling.

2967
02:14:06,820 --> 02:14:07,653
It's unsettling.
And that's one of the worst parts about 

2968
02:14:10,230 --> 02:14:14,350
the really simple build that wall,
build that wall,

2969
02:14:14,590 --> 02:14:17,290
build that wall,
that really simple sentiment.

2970
02:14:17,710 --> 02:14:20,120
There's a problem with that man.
It's different

2971
02:14:20,340 --> 02:14:21,173
between pride in what you are and having
an enemy to that you need this enemy to 

2972
02:14:25,861 --> 02:14:27,210
take people down.
But I mean,

2973
02:14:27,220 --> 02:14:27,950
that's the way

2974
02:14:27,950 --> 02:14:28,850
saying before,
man,

2975
02:14:28,851 --> 02:14:30,770
it's like you,
if you're expressing fear,

2976
02:14:30,890 --> 02:14:33,260
you're going to get a pushback.
If you're expressing anger,

2977
02:14:33,380 --> 02:14:34,570
you're going to get a push,
right?

2978
02:14:34,730 --> 02:14:36,560
If all of a sudden you're like,
build a wall,

2979
02:14:36,680 --> 02:14:37,513
build a wall.
That seems to me to be a place that I 

2980
02:14:39,291 --> 02:14:40,530
want to get in now.
Right?

2981
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:41,793
You know,
and if you're a person who wants to do 

2982
02:14:43,461 --> 02:14:46,730
something bad,
that's the spot that's way more evil now

2983
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,220
because now you've got a big crazy wall,
right?

2984
02:14:49,360 --> 02:14:54,360
Like there's gotta be some sort of 
recognition that will almost like it has

2985
02:14:56,181 --> 02:14:57,014
to come from the top.
It seems like it has to be this size to 

2986
02:14:58,941 --> 02:15:02,450
be some sort of recognition that look 
the reality of our existence here.

2987
02:15:02,451 --> 02:15:06,590
So we're extremely fortunate in the 
reality of other people's existences.

2988
02:15:06,620 --> 02:15:11,090
They got terrible luck that this is.
This is an undeniable reality of babies.

2989
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:12,920
Yeah.
One hundred percent of the time,

2990
02:15:13,130 --> 02:15:15,530
all over the world right now,
baby worked hard to get where they are.

2991
02:15:15,950 --> 02:15:18,110
It just showed up.
Roll the dice.

2992
02:15:18,140 --> 02:15:21,170
He might have the right body.
We're in Manhattan.

2993
02:15:21,190 --> 02:15:22,520
All right,
here's my mom.

2994
02:15:22,610 --> 02:15:25,700
Where are we live in Tribeca,
this great Italian restaurants here,

2995
02:15:25,850 --> 02:15:26,683
good schools.
What a great place to grow up and my 

2996
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:31,610
onesy it's made of so lucky.
Oh my God,

2997
02:15:31,611 --> 02:15:32,680
this is great.
Yeah.

2998
02:15:32,681 --> 02:15:33,514
No,
but the difference between that and 

2999
02:15:34,221 --> 02:15:37,100
being born in a hut in the Congo,
you know,

3000
02:15:37,110 --> 02:15:38,780
I mean you just got lucky.
Yeah.

3001
02:15:39,050 --> 02:15:41,540
So that.
Build the wall,

3002
02:15:41,720 --> 02:15:44,510
build a wall.
I get where you're coming from.

3003
02:15:44,511 --> 02:15:46,820
I understand the motivation to think 
like that,

3004
02:15:46,910 --> 02:15:50,660
but I really pretty firmly believed that
anytime you put something like that out,

3005
02:15:50,840 --> 02:15:52,920
you'd get something like that that comes
back at.

3006
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:58,640
It's anything that has a little hate on 
the edges.

3007
02:15:59,250 --> 02:16:00,083
You know,
there's a lot of people like that guy 

3008
02:16:01,690 --> 02:16:03,300
you say in that video and you know,
they're just,

3009
02:16:03,390 --> 02:16:05,730
it's an aggressive.
Yeah.

3010
02:16:05,820 --> 02:16:07,320
Fuck yeah,
we got it.

3011
02:16:07,350 --> 02:16:08,910
We want.
This is our guy.

3012
02:16:09,170 --> 02:16:11,340
Here we come.
Scary.

3013
02:16:11,370 --> 02:16:12,420
Scary.
I've never been in A.

3014
02:16:12,510 --> 02:16:14,050
I've never lived.
You know,

3015
02:16:14,070 --> 02:16:16,860
I haven't been here that long,
but there's never been after an election

3016
02:16:16,861 --> 02:16:19,440
where large groups of people were 
scared.

3017
02:16:19,940 --> 02:16:21,540
That's never happened.
Unhappy,

3018
02:16:21,930 --> 02:16:22,763
pissed off.
I can't believe they're going to do 

3019
02:16:23,881 --> 02:16:24,714
this,
that that assholes in office never has 

3020
02:16:27,601 --> 02:16:28,434
there been large groups of families 
really legitimately frightened of our 

3021
02:16:34,151 --> 02:16:35,860
leader.
That's never happened.

3022
02:16:36,300 --> 02:16:39,690
I feel like Bill Clinton should just 
step up and just say,

3023
02:16:40,230 --> 02:16:45,230
this is why we always rigged the system.
We're trying to avoid this.

3024
02:16:45,930 --> 02:16:46,763
Okay.
We're protecting you from your own 

3025
02:16:48,091 --> 02:16:52,530
selves are a ridiculous desire to have 
famous people live.

3026
02:16:53,220 --> 02:16:54,720
Congratulations.

3027
02:16:56,270 --> 02:16:58,490
Yeah.
It was rigged for a reason.

3028
02:17:01,740 --> 02:17:04,620
Greatest nickname for trump.
Somebody called them.

3029
02:17:04,621 --> 02:17:06,380
Cheeto Jesus.
Yeah.

3030
02:17:06,570 --> 02:17:07,660
I've been using cheeto

3031
02:17:07,830 --> 02:17:12,480
Jesus.
Yeah.

3032
02:17:12,830 --> 02:17:14,540
On election night,
it was really upsetting.

3033
02:17:14,541 --> 02:17:15,374
My was it.
My daughter was as a 14 year old girl 

3034
02:17:17,900 --> 02:17:20,390
who just heard.
She's smart.

3035
02:17:20,630 --> 02:17:21,463
She's a high school freshmen and just 
heard what this guy was saying about 

3036
02:17:26,001 --> 02:17:28,520
women and just heard what he was saying 
about,

3037
02:17:28,960 --> 02:17:31,130
you know,
handicaps or whatever.

3038
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:32,280
Well,
that hand up thing.

3039
02:17:32,310 --> 02:17:36,690
Did you know that?
That that I'm not giving them an excuse,

3040
02:17:36,691 --> 02:17:39,120
but I don't think he knew that that guy 
was handicapped.

3041
02:17:39,360 --> 02:17:43,290
I think he was trying to mock someone 
who was dumb and he.

3042
02:17:43,390 --> 02:17:44,223
It turned out that the person who was 
mocking was handicapped and that's what 

3043
02:17:46,411 --> 02:17:47,244
everybody rent one.
I don't believe he had any knowledge of 

3044
02:17:49,111 --> 02:17:50,250
that beforehand.
I don't think it was.

3045
02:17:50,530 --> 02:17:52,570
I'll give you that,
but even if he didn't know it,

3046
02:17:52,571 --> 02:17:55,510
to make that gesture and act like that 
guy is just dumb.

3047
02:17:55,511 --> 02:17:58,230
Like as a guy running for president,
it just was.

3048
02:17:58,280 --> 02:17:59,350
It was.
It was a bully.

3049
02:17:59,351 --> 02:18:00,184
It was a bullyish move.
Whether the guy's handicapped or not 

3050
02:18:02,050 --> 02:18:04,030
handing the girls not handing it.
Well he,

3051
02:18:04,031 --> 02:18:04,910
I think he just that

3052
02:18:05,190 --> 02:18:08,040
combative relationships like that or a 
contest.

3053
02:18:08,041 --> 02:18:08,874
It's a war and he,
he'll go out then with his personality 

3054
02:18:11,520 --> 02:18:12,870
and that's what's odd for us.

3055
02:18:13,010 --> 02:18:15,170
And it's from a president,
right?

3056
02:18:15,380 --> 02:18:16,220
Yeah.
There's no.

3057
02:18:16,221 --> 02:18:18,380
Right.
So my daughter was just crying.

3058
02:18:18,530 --> 02:18:19,840
She was just crying.
She's like,

3059
02:18:19,850 --> 02:18:22,940
so a guy that says,
grab your pussy is now my president.

3060
02:18:22,941 --> 02:18:25,280
I just,
this doesn't make sense.

3061
02:18:25,520 --> 02:18:27,380
This guy that says global warming is a 
hoax.

3062
02:18:27,381 --> 02:18:29,810
This doesn't make sense.
Did he really say that?

3063
02:18:29,960 --> 02:18:32,030
Yeah.
You said global warming is a hoax,

3064
02:18:32,060 --> 02:18:35,940
a hoax created by the Chinese.
And she's really fucking said that.

3065
02:18:36,740 --> 02:18:38,000
And she's like,
she's like,

3066
02:18:38,001 --> 02:18:39,230
what?
Just,

3067
02:18:39,260 --> 02:18:42,140
what the hell just happened?
I thought he was just skeptical.

3068
02:18:42,350 --> 02:18:44,000
I thought he was just skeptical about 
man,

3069
02:18:44,030 --> 02:18:44,863
man,
man.

3070
02:18:44,870 --> 02:18:47,420
Influence global warming because that's 
what they like to call it.

3071
02:18:47,421 --> 02:18:48,290
Right.
Influenced.

3072
02:18:48,380 --> 02:18:49,540
Influenced.
Yeah.

3073
02:18:50,150 --> 02:18:50,983
Have you ever seen like the ice core 
samples of like what the earth used to 

3074
02:18:53,811 --> 02:18:56,470
be like just a few,
you know,

3075
02:18:56,680 --> 02:18:57,890
few,
10,000,

3076
02:18:57,891 --> 02:18:58,790
20,000
years ago.

3077
02:18:59,480 --> 02:19:00,520
Oh my God.
The,

3078
02:19:00,690 --> 02:19:01,523
the,
the ice levels rise and the sea levels 

3079
02:19:04,791 --> 02:19:09,230
rise and like the,
this is a constantly changing topography

3080
02:19:09,530 --> 02:19:12,910
and the like,
the natural shifts in the earth cycle.

3081
02:19:12,911 --> 02:19:14,840
And I'm not a climate change denier at 
all.

3082
02:19:14,841 --> 02:19:15,674
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me just get this out because if you 

3083
02:19:16,491 --> 02:19:18,620
talk about this,
people just get angry and a hair trigger

3084
02:19:18,621 --> 02:19:19,670
word.
It's not what I'm saying.

3085
02:19:19,671 --> 02:19:20,240
Yeah.
I mean,

3086
02:19:20,240 --> 02:19:22,040
I absolutely believe that we're fucking 
up this planet.

3087
02:19:22,041 --> 02:19:23,030
That's not what I'm saying.
Yeah.

3088
02:19:23,300 --> 02:19:26,300
But without us doing that,
just without us doing that,

3089
02:19:26,330 --> 02:19:31,330
there's been a constant cycle of change,
violent place and it's sometimes really,

3090
02:19:31,491 --> 02:19:32,324
really radical,
like giant shifts of temperature up and 

3091
02:19:35,211 --> 02:19:36,044
down.

3092
02:19:36,170 --> 02:19:38,810
And you know,
the big one being the ice age,

3093
02:19:38,811 --> 02:19:39,644
of course,
that we can measure fairly recently 

3094
02:19:42,470 --> 02:19:45,050
this,
most of this country was covered up by a

3095
02:19:45,050 --> 02:19:46,790
mile to two miles.
I have ice,

3096
02:19:46,850 --> 02:19:48,800
right?
Miles.

3097
02:19:48,860 --> 02:19:49,940
Yeah.
So what's your point?

3098
02:19:50,480 --> 02:19:54,200
My point is this whole place is super 
volatile.

3099
02:19:54,620 --> 02:19:55,453
I mean this,
for him to say that global warming is a 

3100
02:19:57,261 --> 02:19:59,420
hoax.
It's coming.

3101
02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:01,220
It's coming with a.
You did it.

3102
02:20:01,221 --> 02:20:02,054
I did it.
If it's happening or the concept of 

3103
02:20:03,861 --> 02:20:04,694
global warming was created by and for 
the Chinese in order to make us 

3104
02:20:07,551 --> 02:20:11,000
manufacturing noncompetitive.
November of 2012.

3105
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:11,953
See,
he was probably one of those dudes that 

3106
02:20:13,401 --> 02:20:14,870
believed in the Mayan calendar.
She's like,

3107
02:20:14,871 --> 02:20:15,704
fuck it,
I'm going to say some crazy shit before 

3108
02:20:16,971 --> 02:20:19,040
December 20,
first 2012,

3109
02:20:21,380 --> 02:20:23,060
it'll all be done.
That was,

3110
02:20:23,070 --> 02:20:24,070
um,
that was,

3111
02:20:24,071 --> 02:20:24,904
uh,
something that people were saying back 

3112
02:20:25,551 --> 02:20:27,050
then too.
That was a popular.

3113
02:20:27,051 --> 02:20:27,884
Uh,
he used to say a bunch of crazy shit 

3114
02:20:29,031 --> 02:20:29,864
though.
Remember he used to say that Obama was 

3115
02:20:31,160 --> 02:20:31,993
born in Kenya.
He was a truth or a birth or rather he 

3116
02:20:33,801 --> 02:20:35,120
was the birther.
Yeah.

3117
02:20:35,121 --> 02:20:36,740
I mean,
he was the leader of that.

3118
02:20:37,220 --> 02:20:40,400
He would go and do,
but see you gotta wonder,

3119
02:20:40,401 --> 02:20:42,500
like,
how much of that is showmanship?

3120
02:20:43,010 --> 02:20:43,940
How much day?
I don't know.

3121
02:20:43,941 --> 02:20:44,774
I feel like we're,
I feel like it's the Chauncey Gardner 

3122
02:20:46,131 --> 02:20:46,970
thing,
you know,

3123
02:20:46,971 --> 02:20:47,600
from,
uh,

3124
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:49,620
when Peter Sellers became president,
right?

3125
02:20:49,670 --> 02:20:51,070
He was like the,
it was,

3126
02:20:51,620 --> 02:20:52,453
it was,
uh,

3127
02:20:52,690 --> 02:20:53,780
uh,
being there,

3128
02:20:54,890 --> 02:20:57,590
being there and it was just,
he was the gardener.

3129
02:20:57,591 --> 02:20:58,630
He just,
he had,

3130
02:20:58,760 --> 02:21:02,970
he was very simple and people just made 
it ultimately made him president.

3131
02:21:02,971 --> 02:21:03,804
He just kind of wandered into the 
presidency and I feel like that with 

3132
02:21:06,951 --> 02:21:07,784
trump,
I feel like he wandered in and now 

3133
02:21:09,711 --> 02:21:10,970
people are like,
well,

3134
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:14,450
are these tweets genius or is he trying 
to manipulate us?

3135
02:21:14,510 --> 02:21:17,090
Is huge.
Really intelligent is a really this,

3136
02:21:17,420 --> 02:21:19,880
I think he just usually is what he is,
you know,

3137
02:21:19,881 --> 02:21:23,090
I don't think I would believe very 
talented,

3138
02:21:23,091 --> 02:21:25,650
very charismatic.
Uh,

3139
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:27,500
rich's fuck,
richest fuck.

3140
02:21:27,501 --> 02:21:30,770
He's got a good sense of timing and 
stuff like that,

3141
02:21:30,771 --> 02:21:33,470
but balling out of control.
It's kind of this empty vessel.

3142
02:21:33,471 --> 02:21:34,270
And you know,
the,

3143
02:21:34,270 --> 02:21:36,470
the big shore though.
Yeah,

3144
02:21:36,471 --> 02:21:37,304
I'm pretty sure.
I'm pretty sure when you hear him talk 

3145
02:21:39,051 --> 02:21:39,884
about different things,
he doesn't really know about a lot of 

3146
02:21:41,841 --> 02:21:43,730
different types.
Home alone I did.

3147
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:44,900
He was on the marriage riff.

3148
02:21:46,370 --> 02:21:47,203
It did

3149
02:21:47,630 --> 02:21:49,370
right next door.
That was right there.

3150
02:21:49,400 --> 02:21:51,400
He would make comments about make 
comments.

3151
02:21:51,710 --> 02:21:53,870
It was all about husbands and wives.
You would,

3152
02:21:53,871 --> 02:21:54,704
uh,
show a real husband and wife and then 

3153
02:21:55,491 --> 02:21:56,324
you'd talk about them in these.
You try and decide who's right and the 

3154
02:21:58,521 --> 02:21:59,354
argument,
the husband and the wife and all of his 

3155
02:22:00,801 --> 02:22:05,170
jokes were about the women's breasts who
said all of his jokes were about the,

3156
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:07,250
well,
she's got these big things,

3157
02:22:07,251 --> 02:22:08,300
so she's a,
she'll be okay.

3158
02:22:08,301 --> 02:22:10,160
And then he would turn to me and give me
a wink,

3159
02:22:10,940 --> 02:22:12,620
like not for the camera,
not for anything,

3160
02:22:12,621 --> 02:22:15,170
just me on the side was just kind of 
wink at me.

3161
02:22:15,171 --> 02:22:16,670
Like we're doing great here.
Right.

3162
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:20,890
I felt like it this way before I knew 
anything about him running or anything,

3163
02:22:20,891 --> 02:22:21,750
it was just like,
Ooh,

3164
02:22:22,650 --> 02:22:23,483
scheming me out.
I felt like I was date raped on my own 

3165
02:22:25,110 --> 02:22:25,943
show,

3166
02:22:27,810 --> 02:22:29,730
but he walked in during that show.
Just like,

3167
02:22:29,850 --> 02:22:31,680
we're gonna do great ratings tonight.
We're going to do great.

3168
02:22:31,710 --> 02:22:33,100
We're going to kill it.
We're going to do great rating.

3169
02:22:33,101 --> 02:22:34,320
I mean,
he was always that way.

3170
02:22:34,350 --> 02:22:36,120
Just mantra the mantra,
the mantra.

3171
02:22:36,420 --> 02:22:38,520
I think I would be,
uh,

3172
02:22:38,730 --> 02:22:41,880
I would take it in like it was a show.
I would think I'd be psyched.

3173
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:44,190
I'd be psyched to sit next to them.
Yeah.

3174
02:22:44,191 --> 02:22:45,920
But there's a,
you know,

3175
02:22:45,930 --> 02:22:47,050
how your next Tuesday,
John.

3176
02:22:47,060 --> 02:22:48,270
I'm sorry.
You have to like,

3177
02:22:48,280 --> 02:22:50,820
this is great,
but there's,

3178
02:22:50,821 --> 02:22:51,654
you know,
you get vibes from people and the vibe 

3179
02:22:53,041 --> 02:22:55,590
was a little like,
you know what I mean?

3180
02:22:55,830 --> 02:22:58,350
I don't think you get to be that fucking
rich without a little.

3181
02:22:58,390 --> 02:23:00,570
Oh,
you just don't think you get there.

3182
02:23:00,630 --> 02:23:01,351
Yeah.
Thank you.

3183
02:23:01,351 --> 02:23:02,184
Stop along the way.
Like we were talking about balance and 

3184
02:23:03,541 --> 02:23:05,760
perspective about realizing that,
you know,

3185
02:23:05,770 --> 02:23:06,603
maybe you know,
maybe you should scale back a little 

3186
02:23:09,631 --> 02:23:10,650
bit.
Maybe you'll be happier.

3187
02:23:10,651 --> 02:23:11,484
Maybe you missed the happy spot.
He never thought about that for a 

3188
02:23:13,771 --> 02:23:14,604
fucking second.
I know like now he's like 70 still 

3189
02:23:18,031 --> 02:23:20,470
making deals with Argentina to put up 
hotels.

3190
02:23:20,471 --> 02:23:20,600
Yeah.

3191
02:23:20,600 --> 02:23:25,550
Shit that was like there was one deal 
with a foreign country that was an issue

3192
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:27,860
because it was like right after he 
became president.

3193
02:23:27,861 --> 02:23:30,260
He's trying to like push this.
They congratulated him.

3194
02:23:30,261 --> 02:23:31,600
He's trying to like push this deal.

3195
02:23:32,110 --> 02:23:35,020
Do you think he took the Taiwan call his
in September,

3196
02:23:35,370 --> 02:23:38,050
they're creating a thing in Taiwan.
They want to make it like Dubai,

3197
02:23:38,110 --> 02:23:42,100
like a hub for international Asian,
Asian travel and they're in the mix.

3198
02:23:42,101 --> 02:23:42,934
They had been talking to trump.
The word trump is worth so much more 

3199
02:23:46,121 --> 02:23:47,020
now.
Oh my God.

3200
02:23:47,021 --> 02:23:48,340
It's one thing.
I mean,

3201
02:23:48,400 --> 02:23:50,740
and that's all he wanted.
So how do you not.

3202
02:23:51,430 --> 02:23:52,600
I mean,
how do you.

3203
02:23:52,690 --> 02:23:54,850
I can't pull away now.
We've made it.

3204
02:23:54,880 --> 02:23:56,980
This is the.
This is when we take over the planet.

3205
02:23:57,610 --> 02:23:59,860
I don't remember who had the original 
thought,

3206
02:23:59,861 --> 02:24:01,510
but I agree with this thought.
Not Mine,

3207
02:24:01,630 --> 02:24:06,550
my thought originally,
but that what is interesting about trump

3208
02:24:06,940 --> 02:24:11,260
is that he cares so much about how 
people like him.

3209
02:24:11,500 --> 02:24:14,560
So because of that,
the will of the people,

3210
02:24:14,950 --> 02:24:18,640
whether it's marijuana or whether it's 
whatever it is,

3211
02:24:18,641 --> 02:24:19,474
maybe it's nonviolent drug offenders 
that have been in jail forever for no 

3212
02:24:22,211 --> 02:24:24,190
fucking reason.
That makes any sense to anybody now that

3213
02:24:24,191 --> 02:24:25,024
were the.
If you take and you put someone into Ge 

3214
02:24:26,650 --> 02:24:27,483
in jail for life in 1975 for marijuana 
because they smoked marijuana in Las 

3215
02:24:31,270 --> 02:24:33,960
Vegas,
that a person person's still in jail.

3216
02:24:33,970 --> 02:24:35,410
Crazy.
And you're,

3217
02:24:35,470 --> 02:24:36,880
you're the president now,
Mr Trump,

3218
02:24:36,881 --> 02:24:39,040
please let them out.
Please just,

3219
02:24:39,041 --> 02:24:39,910
you know,
let's find,

3220
02:24:39,940 --> 02:24:41,470
let's find a way to get these people 
jobs.

3221
02:24:41,740 --> 02:24:42,573
They weren't,
they weren't arrested because what they 

3222
02:24:44,591 --> 02:24:45,424
did was wrong.
They were arrested because there was a 

3223
02:24:47,591 --> 02:24:50,470
thing written down on a piece of paper 
that said it was wrong.

3224
02:24:50,710 --> 02:24:51,543
It's not really wrong.
There's nothing wrong with what they 

3225
02:24:53,171 --> 02:24:54,004
did.
Just because it was written on a piece 

3226
02:24:55,511 --> 02:24:56,890
of paper doesn't mean we should honor 
it.

3227
02:24:57,070 --> 02:24:59,560
So many years later when we would never 
act accordingly,

3228
02:24:59,740 --> 02:25:02,890
you would never know the fuck.
No one in this country is going to go to

3229
02:25:02,891 --> 02:25:04,570
jail for the rest of their life because 
they have a joint,

3230
02:25:04,760 --> 02:25:08,800
but isn't it entirely possible that 
someone in this country has gone to jail

3231
02:25:08,890 --> 02:25:10,270
for the rest of their life?
For a joint?

3232
02:25:10,271 --> 02:25:11,104
Absolutely.
Especially if you get inside and then 

3233
02:25:12,491 --> 02:25:13,960
all of a sudden you get in a fight in 
jail,

3234
02:25:14,260 --> 02:25:15,093
which happens all the time and someone 
dies and you wind up getting charged 

3235
02:25:17,081 --> 02:25:17,914
with murder.
I mean that kind of stuff happens to 

3236
02:25:19,181 --> 02:25:20,014
people over a nonsense bullshit.
Arrests aren't most people jail because 

3237
02:25:23,801 --> 02:25:24,550
of

3238
02:25:24,550 --> 02:25:25,950
drug related.

3239
02:25:26,030 --> 02:25:26,863
We just pulled it up the other day.
I was like 46 percent nonviolent drug 

3240
02:25:30,231 --> 02:25:31,940
offenders.
Forty six percent in jail.

3241
02:25:32,230 --> 02:25:33,640
It's a lot.
It's insane,

3242
02:25:33,730 --> 02:25:35,020
but the thing is,
like you say,

3243
02:25:35,130 --> 02:25:38,350
he wants to be popular and he wants to 
be well liked in all.

3244
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:39,873
The thing we're going to find out is on 
what level does is he looking for that 

3245
02:25:43,511 --> 02:25:44,344
approval?
Is it from the masses saying this stuff 

3246
02:25:46,510 --> 02:25:50,710
or is it the guy?
The last guy that came in is it sessions

3247
02:25:50,711 --> 02:25:53,170
that comes in and says,
I think that we should,

3248
02:25:53,620 --> 02:25:56,410
we should go this way,
and he wants to get earned.

3249
02:25:56,411 --> 02:25:57,244
The respect of that guy.
When you have a lot of forces coming in 

3250
02:26:00,730 --> 02:26:01,563
that we didn't vote for that are going 
to be controlling a lot because he's 

3251
02:26:04,301 --> 02:26:06,250
going to be just kind of delegating it 
out.

3252
02:26:06,251 --> 02:26:09,460
We don't really know where he stands.
That's the most scary thing is that it's

3253
02:26:09,461 --> 02:26:10,294
kind of unknowable.
We don't know how much in control he is 

3254
02:26:13,301 --> 02:26:14,134
going to be.
Are these other people going to come in 

3255
02:26:14,831 --> 02:26:17,170
and fill that vacuum and they're going 
to be in control.

3256
02:26:17,860 --> 02:26:22,210
Big argument against the NDA,
the national defense.

3257
02:26:22,240 --> 02:26:24,830
What are the National Defense 
Authorization Act that with the NDA,

3258
02:26:25,210 --> 02:26:26,043
that was the one that allowed for 
indefinite detainment don't need a 

3259
02:26:29,051 --> 02:26:29,884
warrant.
You can just arrest people and detain 

3260
02:26:32,201 --> 02:26:35,110
them indefinitely without.
They don't have to have a speedy trial.

3261
02:26:35,350 --> 02:26:38,230
The right to a speedy trial has been 
revoked and everybody was like,

3262
02:26:38,231 --> 02:26:39,064
well,
that's fine because Obama is not going 

3263
02:26:39,551 --> 02:26:41,560
to use that one.
Then the question was like,

3264
02:26:41,561 --> 02:26:43,270
okay,
Obama might not be using it,

3265
02:26:43,300 --> 02:26:46,420
but what happens if a new president gets
into office and he's crazy?

3266
02:26:46,610 --> 02:26:47,680
Everyone's like,
don't worry,

3267
02:26:47,681 --> 02:26:49,240
that's not going to happen.
Well guess what?

3268
02:26:49,270 --> 02:26:50,103
Yeah,
you fucked up so that Donald Trump has 

3269
02:26:52,181 --> 02:26:54,070
the n,
d a on his side.

3270
02:26:54,071 --> 02:26:54,910
He can use it now

3271
02:26:55,110 --> 02:26:55,943
and add to that and incident.
Add to that some kind of nine slash 11 

3272
02:27:01,170 --> 02:27:02,790
and then he really takes advantage of 
it.

3273
02:27:02,800 --> 02:27:04,000
You never know.
You never know.

3274
02:27:04,030 --> 02:27:04,863
You never know.
One thing that should be taken into 

3275
02:27:06,881 --> 02:27:07,714
consideration though is that he's a 
businessman and one of the things about 

3276
02:27:10,270 --> 02:27:14,530
things like legalizing marijuana or 
going against legalized marijuana,

3277
02:27:14,860 --> 02:27:15,693
it doesn't make sense from a business 
standpoint because there's too many of 

3278
02:27:19,481 --> 02:27:22,390
us that smoke it.
Like Jamie put up the numbers.

3279
02:27:22,510 --> 02:27:24,340
What percentage,
let's just say Tom,

3280
02:27:24,370 --> 02:27:25,203
papa,
what percentage of Americans do you 

3281
02:27:27,011 --> 02:27:28,180
think smoke marijuana?

3282
02:27:28,500 --> 02:27:32,520
What percentage of adult Americans smoke
marijuana?

3283
02:27:32,521 --> 02:27:36,690
I would put it at.
I'm going to put it like smoke it on the

3284
02:27:36,691 --> 02:27:39,240
regular,
so once a month.

3285
02:27:39,300 --> 02:27:40,890
More than once a month.
More than once a month.

3286
02:27:40,891 --> 02:27:45,720
I would say that that number is at 46 
percent.

3287
02:27:46,150 --> 02:27:48,640
I bet you're right.
I was gonna go in the forties to.

3288
02:27:48,641 --> 02:27:50,410
I was going to say like 43.
Yeah,

3289
02:27:50,590 --> 02:27:53,140
but I think 46 rang in my head too.
Yeah,

3290
02:27:53,320 --> 02:27:55,120
that's a good number.
I think you're dead on.

3291
02:27:56,460 --> 02:27:58,460
That's what I would guess.
It's hard static.

3292
02:27:58,470 --> 02:28:01,380
Find maybe Halep poll.
Gallup polls are bullshit.

3293
02:28:02,110 --> 02:28:02,943
Let's go with it.
Anyway.

3294
02:28:02,980 --> 02:28:05,720
Was it says one in eight US adults say 
they smoke

3295
02:28:05,780 --> 02:28:07,160
marijuana.
How dare they?

3296
02:28:07,490 --> 02:28:10,070
One in eight people dumb enough to 
answer a fucking pole.

3297
02:28:10,250 --> 02:28:12,800
Meanwhile,
pitches.

3298
02:28:13,570 --> 02:28:16,160
I had a little bit in my act.
It's based on true pole.

3299
02:28:16,490 --> 02:28:17,323
We're 46 percent of the people believed 
in the creationist account of the earth 

3300
02:28:21,400 --> 02:28:22,040
that the earth was

3301
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:23,330
less than 10,000
years old.

3302
02:28:23,720 --> 02:28:25,280
Forty six,
46 percent,

3303
02:28:25,310 --> 02:28:27,350
46 percent,
but was a Gallup poll.

3304
02:28:27,351 --> 02:28:29,120
So it's 46 percent of the people that 
answer the poll.

3305
02:28:29,121 --> 02:28:32,540
That was a little bit in my right,
so like how ridiculous.

3306
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:34,880
That's not.
You're not getting a good test group.

3307
02:28:35,080 --> 02:28:38,450
So actually answering the question,
people are answering the phone,

3308
02:28:39,970 --> 02:28:42,020
talking to you about some different 
aspects.

3309
02:28:42,040 --> 02:28:44,040
Percent said they have tried it.
Hm.

3310
02:28:44,180 --> 02:28:45,650
Okay.
So that's 43 percent.

3311
02:28:45,651 --> 02:28:46,484
If it was legal,
it'd be smoking pot and they currently 

3312
02:28:48,501 --> 02:28:51,350
use it except for a few pussies that 
couldn't handle the truth.

3313
02:28:51,660 --> 02:28:56,660
A thousand people.
So you can handle the truth.

3314
02:28:57,200 --> 02:28:58,130
Yeah.
It's not that many,

3315
02:28:58,131 --> 02:29:02,300
but it's enough to put a lot of tax 
dollars into the economy.

3316
02:29:02,350 --> 02:29:04,220
It's true.
It's a tremendous amount of money.

3317
02:29:04,430 --> 02:29:06,020
I know.
If it's really 40,

3318
02:29:06,080 --> 02:29:07,310
whatever the hell it is.
Present.

3319
02:29:07,370 --> 02:29:08,203
Tried it.
What was the present of the trial at 

3320
02:29:09,021 --> 02:29:09,854
1:43.

3321
02:29:09,890 --> 02:29:11,200
Forty three,
dude,

3322
02:29:11,240 --> 02:29:13,880
that's the number.
I just crazy,

3323
02:29:13,881 --> 02:29:15,320
man.
That's pretty good.

3324
02:29:15,370 --> 02:29:19,300
It's crazy to another question.
Shut the fuck up dude.

3325
02:29:20,200 --> 02:29:25,200
You ruin it was in those people against 
you voting wise,

3326
02:29:27,500 --> 02:29:30,590
that's a pretty significant people like 
the stoner dollar has been ignored.

3327
02:29:30,591 --> 02:29:31,424
Yes,
but you say who will make those 

3328
02:29:32,991 --> 02:29:33,824
decisions as a businessman,
but the other people that are fighting 

3329
02:29:36,711 --> 02:29:40,040
against that or all the pharmaceutical 
companies and they have a lot more money

3330
02:29:40,041 --> 02:29:40,874
than these kids smoking pot.
So that businessman walks into his 

3331
02:29:44,181 --> 02:29:45,890
office and says,
Hey,

3332
02:29:46,520 --> 02:29:49,040
this is the way it's really going to go.
This is what we really need.

3333
02:29:49,041 --> 02:29:53,000
That is permanent though,
isn't it possible that the people acting

3334
02:29:53,001 --> 02:29:56,780
collectively have more,
more influence collectively,

3335
02:29:56,810 --> 02:30:00,050
financially than a corporation?
It's been exposed.

3336
02:30:00,980 --> 02:30:03,840
Never.
It's not going to get any better because

3337
02:30:03,841 --> 02:30:08,720
of the Internet transparency there right
now.

3338
02:30:08,780 --> 02:30:11,950
The corporations have a lot more power,
right?

3339
02:30:12,050 --> 02:30:13,220
Right now,
right now.

3340
02:30:13,221 --> 02:30:14,420
But you know,
you watch,

3341
02:30:14,421 --> 02:30:16,340
uh,
you know,

3342
02:30:16,400 --> 02:30:20,510
Elon musk is not been torn down yet.
They're coming at him.

3343
02:30:20,900 --> 02:30:23,080
Oil wants to stop them.
They want to stop her from selling those

3344
02:30:23,110 --> 02:30:24,140
cars.
They wanted to do all this stuff.

3345
02:30:24,320 --> 02:30:28,550
But he's the will of the people is kind 
of protected them,

3346
02:30:28,551 --> 02:30:29,780
put them through,
you know,

3347
02:30:29,781 --> 02:30:31,130
iron man is going to be president,
right?

3348
02:30:31,190 --> 02:30:34,670
I hope so.
I hope so.

3349
02:30:34,820 --> 02:30:38,150
This is deliveries last chance he's my 
back around.

3350
02:30:38,151 --> 02:30:41,240
We need a running this thing.
We tried to assholes.

3351
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:43,673
He's got a little mix of both designee.
Don't you want to see what happens with 

3352
02:30:46,461 --> 02:30:47,294
the trump thing?
What if he can break down the 

3353
02:30:48,081 --> 02:30:49,670
structures?
We're gonna point.

3354
02:30:49,970 --> 02:30:52,070
That's my whole part is like,
you know,

3355
02:30:52,071 --> 02:30:55,490
we are a revolutionary people.
Let's tear some stuff down and let's not

3356
02:30:55,491 --> 02:31:00,440
be afraid to break down some walls and 
let's shake things up and move.

3357
02:31:00,441 --> 02:31:02,960
That's a little bit of a revolution.
Break.

3358
02:31:02,961 --> 02:31:06,440
This system that is broken anyway,
five percent.

3359
02:31:06,560 --> 02:31:07,393
Let's just hope that it's safe.
Let's hope that it's not empowering the 

3360
02:31:11,241 --> 02:31:12,074
wrong people.
He's really interesting what he's been 

3361
02:31:14,091 --> 02:31:14,924
trying to say about lobbyists to,
but when you know how long you need to 

3362
02:31:18,351 --> 02:31:20,250
take a break after a job in government

3363
02:31:20,250 --> 02:31:22,650
before he should be like the lobbyists.
That sounds good.

3364
02:31:22,910 --> 02:31:24,360
A lot of.
Lot of good ideas.

3365
02:31:24,420 --> 02:31:26,070
That's not so bad.
Who knows?

3366
02:31:26,100 --> 02:31:27,360
That's okay.
Let's see.

3367
02:31:28,170 --> 02:31:30,270
Last comes in.
I'm rooting for him.

3368
02:31:30,360 --> 02:31:33,150
Two thousand 20.
He comes in riding the wave.

3369
02:31:33,210 --> 02:31:34,800
Ilan canty ladies,
we're going to be.

3370
02:31:35,430 --> 02:31:37,680
We're going to be on Mars by the time 
he's getting them.

3371
02:31:37,681 --> 02:31:40,290
Ours Jetski blowing up.
He's getting.

3372
02:31:40,291 --> 02:31:42,810
He's getting them.
It blew up the satellite for the African

3373
02:31:42,811 --> 02:31:43,644
kids that are going to get the internet,
so the African kids so they could send 

3374
02:31:45,691 --> 02:31:49,020
the Dick pics through the air and you 
gotta fail.

3375
02:31:49,021 --> 02:31:53,250
You gotta you gotta fail to succeed.
It wasn't the facebook thing.

3376
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:54,113
Yeah,
it was Zuckerberg's satellite for 

3377
02:31:55,740 --> 02:32:00,740
Internet accidents.
He's got money or maybe space x is doing

3378
02:32:00,931 --> 02:32:04,230
just fine.
He's going to do fund NASA.

3379
02:32:04,231 --> 02:32:05,064
They say it's going to kick ass.
Glad you brought that up because he was 

3380
02:32:07,741 --> 02:32:09,510
also a victim of some fake news.

3381
02:32:09,830 --> 02:32:10,663
There was some fake news articles that 
were written about him that people 

3382
02:32:12,511 --> 02:32:17,511
actually quoted on Ilan Ilan,
and about how much elon musk made off of

3383
02:32:17,941 --> 02:32:20,580
the government and like how much of his,
uh,

3384
02:32:20,670 --> 02:32:23,980
his businesses lose money and it was,
uh,

3385
02:32:24,060 --> 02:32:26,250
an anonymous account.
Like some,

3386
02:32:26,251 --> 02:32:27,084
they tried to trace the name of whoever 
had written this article or more than 

3387
02:32:29,881 --> 02:32:32,940
one article and they couldn't find who 
the writer was.

3388
02:32:33,100 --> 02:32:34,860
Somebody.
It was a fake name.

3389
02:32:34,870 --> 02:32:38,460
The store didn't jive.
The numbers didn't pan out.

3390
02:32:39,140 --> 02:32:42,390
You need to do that stuff.
That's going to be the kid.

3391
02:32:42,930 --> 02:32:43,763
I want to know what the story is because
I'm just talking about it and find out 

3392
02:32:46,831 --> 02:32:47,910
what that story is.
Jamie,

3393
02:32:47,911 --> 02:32:51,270
if you could find out the fake news 
story about Elon Musk.

3394
02:32:51,330 --> 02:32:52,520
He's the greatest.
He got.

3395
02:32:52,890 --> 02:32:53,723
He got somebody wrote something 96 
percent sure I know what the fuck I'm 

3396
02:32:58,531 --> 02:33:01,830
talking about 43 percent sure you do so 
much.

3397
02:33:02,400 --> 02:33:03,750
So much less confidence.
Now.

3398
02:33:06,870 --> 02:33:07,703
Something you can say with authority he 
learned must calls out the fake news 

3399
02:33:12,421 --> 02:33:14,520
troll called them a national disgrace.
Oh yeah,

3400
02:33:14,521 --> 02:33:15,930
yeah.
It is a fake news story.

3401
02:33:15,931 --> 02:33:17,340
Okay,
so what was it?

3402
02:33:18,330 --> 02:33:21,020
At least we identified fake news.
That's right.

3403
02:33:21,190 --> 02:33:24,570
The tractor comes wrapped up in the 
package of a legitimate journalist.

3404
02:33:24,620 --> 02:33:25,590
Yeah.
They were at a coast.

3405
02:33:25,650 --> 02:33:29,310
He's being trolled by a a.
what's that word?

3406
02:33:29,311 --> 02:33:30,960
Shamira.
Shamira.

3407
02:33:31,380 --> 02:33:32,880
God,
I don't remember what that word is.

3408
02:33:33,960 --> 02:33:36,070
What does that?
Tumeric,

3409
02:33:36,630 --> 02:33:37,201
c,
H,

3410
02:33:37,201 --> 02:33:38,580
I,
C,

3411
02:33:38,581 --> 02:33:39,090
h,
I,

3412
02:33:39,090 --> 02:33:40,350
m,
e r I c,

3413
02:33:40,410 --> 02:33:42,030
what does that word mean?
Where is it?

3414
02:33:42,210 --> 02:33:46,980
Right there by a chimeric writer calling
himself stepper Shepherd Stuart.

3415
02:33:47,160 --> 02:33:50,320
See that?
Troll buy tumeric,

3416
02:33:50,350 --> 02:33:52,320
writer Jamie,
Google.

3417
02:33:52,321 --> 02:33:57,150
That word flourish and may that all look
up in dictionary was I should say,

3418
02:33:59,690 --> 02:34:01,240
um,
look it up in a dictionary of itch.

3419
02:34:01,840 --> 02:34:05,030
Me Doing.
Hm.

3420
02:34:05,270 --> 02:34:08,790
That's a cool word.
It will like a fucking little animal.

3421
02:34:08,791 --> 02:34:11,710
Look at that little thing.
Little furry soccer ships.

3422
02:34:11,750 --> 02:34:16,750
Feminism or Shamira is a single org.
Thanks Jamie.

3423
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:18,813
Relating to derive from or being a gym 
genetic extra mirror or its genetic 

3424
02:34:23,201 --> 02:34:23,981
material.
Okay.

3425
02:34:23,981 --> 02:34:26,770
Go back to the last one.
That was just like a rat.

3426
02:34:27,810 --> 02:34:31,420
They saying these rat lake [inaudible].
Click on that one.

3427
02:34:31,421 --> 02:34:32,890
We were just reading.
Yeah.

3428
02:34:32,960 --> 02:34:35,230
The whatever the one was to you right 
before that one.

3429
02:34:38,050 --> 02:34:39,030
Well that's okay.
Let's,

3430
02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:41,110
let's just look at it right there,
but scroll down.

3431
02:34:41,111 --> 02:34:43,930
That little definition on top is a 
little bit more lengthly.

3432
02:34:44,170 --> 02:34:47,290
There we go.
So a single origin asm composed of cells

3433
02:34:47,291 --> 02:34:48,930
from different zygotes.
Oh,

3434
02:34:48,931 --> 02:34:49,764
okay.
So a single cell like an Amoeba will 

3435
02:34:54,340 --> 02:34:54,910
hold on.
Stop,

3436
02:34:54,910 --> 02:34:55,743
go back.
This can result in male and female 

3437
02:34:59,141 --> 02:35:03,580
organs to blood types or subtle 
variations and form.

3438
02:35:03,910 --> 02:35:05,560
Okay.
Now go back to that story again.

3439
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:08,913
Okay.
A chimeric writer calling himself 

3440
02:35:11,230 --> 02:35:15,730
shepherd Stewart sold by this one celled
organism writer.

3441
02:35:15,790 --> 02:35:16,830
Yeah.
So that.

3442
02:35:16,831 --> 02:35:17,664
That's an insult.
I guess in the wake of the 2016 US 

3443
02:35:21,911 --> 02:35:24,970
presidential election,
two major issues rose to the surface.

3444
02:35:24,971 --> 02:35:25,804
Dissemination of information,
fake news and accusations of bias 

3445
02:35:29,081 --> 02:35:30,700
journalism.
Okay.

3446
02:35:30,701 --> 02:35:35,500
So Elon Musk,
can anyone uncover who is really writing

3447
02:35:35,501 --> 02:35:37,630
these fake pieces?
That's cool.

3448
02:35:37,670 --> 02:35:40,450
Call asking for the Internet to help.
Yeah.

3449
02:35:40,600 --> 02:35:43,000
His can't be this guy.
His work is better than that.

3450
02:35:43,001 --> 02:35:45,820
And then they click on that article,
click on that article and finance.

3451
02:35:46,120 --> 02:35:47,140
See if they took it down.

3452
02:35:49,070 --> 02:35:51,830
That's pretty great.
Elan musk versus the trolls.

3453
02:35:51,890 --> 02:35:52,670
Oh,
okay.

3454
02:35:52,670 --> 02:35:53,503
They switched it to this.
So it's just essentially Elon musk 

3455
02:35:57,020 --> 02:35:58,970
calling out this guy for the fake 
article.

3456
02:35:58,971 --> 02:36:00,350
I don't think the fake articles up 
anymore.

3457
02:36:00,351 --> 02:36:01,184
I think the,
uh,

3458
02:36:01,220 --> 02:36:02,053
he's the coolest,
but I think that's just what you can do 

3459
02:36:05,061 --> 02:36:05,894
now.
If this guy who was we were reading 

3460
02:36:06,681 --> 02:36:08,700
about earlier,
this guy can get 10,000

3461
02:36:08,740 --> 02:36:10,180
bucks a month.
Yeah.

3462
02:36:10,670 --> 02:36:12,770
By just making stuff up,
just make up stories.

3463
02:36:12,771 --> 02:36:13,604
They so many made up an article about me
getting into a fight with a mountain 

3464
02:36:15,561 --> 02:36:18,440
lion that killed them,
outline at the Ice House.

3465
02:36:18,500 --> 02:36:21,430
Really ridiculous.
My sister called me up and asked me what

3466
02:36:21,440 --> 02:36:22,910
is true.
Oh my God.

3467
02:36:23,150 --> 02:36:25,730
But they just do that all day.
So if they do that all the day,

3468
02:36:25,731 --> 02:36:28,140
you know,
a Jodie foster visited by real aliens.

3469
02:36:28,190 --> 02:36:29,410
If they do that,
you know,

3470
02:36:29,411 --> 02:36:30,244
like,
and then you'll have her sitting there 

3471
02:36:31,071 --> 02:36:31,760
talking about it.

3472
02:36:31,760 --> 02:36:35,570
Like if you're a dumb ass,
you gonna send that to your friend.

3473
02:36:36,050 --> 02:36:37,940
Jodie foster was fucking coming out,
man.

3474
02:36:38,090 --> 02:36:41,000
Finally,
the agendas being new and the aliens are

3475
02:36:41,001 --> 02:36:41,840
real.
They're here,

3476
02:36:41,860 --> 02:36:42,980
Bro.
Yeah,

3477
02:36:43,490 --> 02:36:46,490
and just keep putting them at one of 
them's gonna stick right in my head,

3478
02:36:46,540 --> 02:36:47,700
Bro.
Definition.

3479
02:36:47,810 --> 02:36:49,070
Oh,
another definition.

3480
02:36:49,100 --> 02:36:51,170
Unreal.
Imaginary visionary,

3481
02:36:51,171 --> 02:36:53,660
a trauma lyrical,
terrestrial paradise.

3482
02:36:54,560 --> 02:36:58,910
Wildly fanciful,
highly unrealistic plan.

3483
02:36:59,660 --> 02:37:01,310
Interesting.
Unreal.

3484
02:37:01,311 --> 02:37:06,311
Imaginary or visionary.
So it was an imaginary writer as well.

3485
02:37:07,030 --> 02:37:09,050
It sounds like a real writer with an 
imaginary name.

3486
02:37:09,080 --> 02:37:13,740
So it's just a pseudonym.
Essentially a pseudonym with the fucking

3487
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:15,440
person is a pseudonym.
Bomp.

3488
02:37:15,560 --> 02:37:16,393
Bomp.
Bomp.

3489
02:37:16,550 --> 02:37:17,383
I wonder if like businesses hire people 
to do things like that to discredit 

3490
02:37:20,571 --> 02:37:22,790
them.
Yeah,

3491
02:37:23,320 --> 02:37:24,153
if you're Ford and the Chevy guys who 
are just getting a little too fucking 

3492
02:37:26,751 --> 02:37:30,080
cocky and there was some dude like Henry
Ford type character over it.

3493
02:37:30,080 --> 02:37:32,750
Chevy,
some magnanimous,

3494
02:37:32,780 --> 02:37:33,613
gigantic larger than life figure and 
start writing some fake shit about him 

3495
02:37:36,820 --> 02:37:37,653
pawning money off the government and 
eating pizza at this place where they 

3496
02:37:39,711 --> 02:37:40,544
have pedophilia artwork.
In the old days they called it yellow 

3497
02:37:42,441 --> 02:37:45,470
journalism,
the hearst newspapers.

3498
02:37:45,471 --> 02:37:46,304
They'd plants fake stories in the papers
and people would think that they were 

3499
02:37:50,031 --> 02:37:50,864
true and you'd try and take down titans 
of business that you were competing 

3500
02:37:53,331 --> 02:37:56,240
against and all the rest of it.
It's always existed.

3501
02:37:56,660 --> 02:37:57,021
Well,
you know,

3502
02:37:57,021 --> 02:38:00,110
that's what William Randolph hearst did 
against marijuana.

3503
02:38:00,510 --> 02:38:02,750
Oh,
that's how marijuana became illegal.

3504
02:38:02,810 --> 02:38:03,980
Really?
You know?

3505
02:38:04,070 --> 02:38:04,903
No,
I did not know the full stoner Bible 

3506
02:38:06,801 --> 02:38:07,820
story.
Now,

3507
02:38:07,880 --> 02:38:10,100
the biblical creation story of the 
Stoner myth.

3508
02:38:10,220 --> 02:38:11,060
Real.
Yeah.

3509
02:38:11,061 --> 02:38:11,894
This is what it is here.
That would been 19 thirties post right 

3510
02:38:15,381 --> 02:38:17,330
after prohibition.
Alcohol prohibition.

3511
02:38:17,780 --> 02:38:18,613
The.
What happened was they came out with a 

3512
02:38:20,091 --> 02:38:24,290
machine called the decorticator and the 
decorticator allows them to process hemp

3513
02:38:24,291 --> 02:38:26,300
fiber more easily with this machine.

3514
02:38:26,300 --> 02:38:29,540
It cranks it through because hemp is 
this spectacular fiber.

3515
02:38:29,870 --> 02:38:32,150
Like a buddy of mine had a hemp stalk 
over his house.

3516
02:38:32,151 --> 02:38:33,560
My friend Todd Mccormick,
and he's like,

3517
02:38:33,561 --> 02:38:35,210
pick it up man.
And I picked it.

3518
02:38:35,211 --> 02:38:36,080
I was like,
whoa.

3519
02:38:36,110 --> 02:38:37,870
It's light like Balsa wood,
like,

3520
02:38:37,880 --> 02:38:39,710
but hard,
like a Mahogany.

3521
02:38:40,030 --> 02:38:41,220
It's weird.
Yeah.

3522
02:38:41,330 --> 02:38:43,320
It's a very,
very strange bamboo.

3523
02:38:43,760 --> 02:38:44,980
No,
no,

3524
02:38:44,990 --> 02:38:45,291
no,
no,

3525
02:38:45,291 --> 02:38:47,660
because bamboo is hollow.
It makes sense that it's light.

3526
02:38:47,990 --> 02:38:49,940
This is like a thing.
It was like a stock,

3527
02:38:49,941 --> 02:38:51,930
like a risk side.
Like my wrist.

3528
02:38:52,760 --> 02:38:53,950
That's bamboo,
right?

3529
02:38:53,951 --> 02:38:56,170
That's the hemp plant.
Yeah.

3530
02:38:56,590 --> 02:38:57,423
You can get it and there's different 
forms of it and see that one in the 

3531
02:39:00,501 --> 02:39:02,190
upper right hand corner like that.
So this.

3532
02:39:03,110 --> 02:39:05,180
Gotcha.
He had it like that.

3533
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:06,710
Right.
So you would pick it up.

3534
02:39:06,740 --> 02:39:09,530
It'd be super light,
but ridiculously hard.

3535
02:39:09,710 --> 02:39:10,341
He's like,
dude,

3536
02:39:10,341 --> 02:39:12,200
it's alien.
It's an alien planet.

3537
02:39:12,660 --> 02:39:14,330
It's todd's very,
very smart.

3538
02:39:14,600 --> 02:39:15,433
He's written books on growing marijuana.
He was like one of the first guys to 

3539
02:39:17,241 --> 02:39:19,340
ever get arrested for,
um,

3540
02:39:19,610 --> 02:39:22,220
growing medical marijuana.
And then when he went to court,

3541
02:39:22,221 --> 02:39:25,730
he found out he was not even allowed to 
use the term medical.

3542
02:39:26,350 --> 02:39:29,150
So you're not allowed to say it because 
they don't believe in it federally.

3543
02:39:29,151 --> 02:39:29,984
So even though it's legal in California,
what they did was they prosecuted him 

3544
02:39:33,681 --> 02:39:36,650
with federal laws which don't allow for 
the,

3545
02:39:36,651 --> 02:39:37,484
even the phrase medical marijuana,
he wasn't even allowed because it was a 

3546
02:39:40,131 --> 02:39:40,964
federal trial.
He wasn't even allowed to mention that 

3547
02:39:43,101 --> 02:39:46,610
it was legal in California.
So the people who were in the jury,

3548
02:39:46,720 --> 02:39:51,720
they get this totally skewed perspective
of what happened and you have to vote on

3549
02:39:53,991 --> 02:39:54,441
it.
You know,

3550
02:39:54,441 --> 02:39:57,170
as a juror,
you have to decide based on the law.

3551
02:39:57,620 --> 02:39:59,570
And the law is federally,
it is illegal.

3552
02:39:59,570 --> 02:40:01,070
There's no such thing as medical 
marijuana.

3553
02:40:01,071 --> 02:40:01,904
So you can't even bring it up.
And if you brought in contempt of court 

3554
02:40:04,970 --> 02:40:06,960
and her started all this,
he started.

3555
02:40:07,310 --> 02:40:10,280
And what happened was when they came out
with the decorticator,

3556
02:40:10,640 --> 02:40:12,830
William Randolph hearst owned paper 
mills,

3557
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:16,950
and he also owned these forests of trees
that they would convert into paper.

3558
02:40:16,951 --> 02:40:19,470
He made his own newspaper and print it 
on that paper,

3559
02:40:20,010 --> 02:40:24,090
and then Popular Science magazine had a 
cover that said hemp,

3560
02:40:24,360 --> 02:40:25,193
the new billion dollar crop,
and it was all about the invention of 

3561
02:40:28,831 --> 02:40:29,664
the decorticator and how now they'd be 
able to effectively process this hemp 

3562
02:40:32,910 --> 02:40:36,840
because they used hemp forever because 
he didn't have a cotton gin.

3563
02:40:37,110 --> 02:40:37,943
They only came out with the cotton gin.
A lot of people shifted over to cotton 

3564
02:40:40,201 --> 02:40:42,660
because,
especially at the end of slavery,

3565
02:40:42,810 --> 02:40:43,643
because it wasn't really financially 
sound until they spend all that time 

3566
02:40:47,851 --> 02:40:48,684
processing all that,
that fiber to get cannabis or to get a 

3567
02:40:52,920 --> 02:40:55,460
canvas where when you could just get it 
out of cotton,

3568
02:40:55,470 --> 02:40:58,260
it'd be like way easier now with this,
a cotton gin,

3569
02:40:58,380 --> 02:40:59,070
the cotton gin.

3570
02:40:59,070 --> 02:40:59,903
So that changed the game.
And then the decorticator changed the 

3571
02:41:02,011 --> 02:41:02,844
game again.
And that's when William Randolph hearst 

3572
02:41:05,071 --> 02:41:05,904
came in and they started writing all 
these stories about telling people to 

3573
02:41:08,911 --> 02:41:11,010
write stories.
I'm sure telling people to write stories

3574
02:41:11,011 --> 02:41:15,600
about this new drug called marijuana.
It's forcing blacks and Mexicans to have

3575
02:41:15,601 --> 02:41:16,434
sex with white women and rape white 
women and marijuana wasn't even a name 

3576
02:41:20,010 --> 02:41:21,860
for,
for the camp,

3577
02:41:22,050 --> 02:41:26,400
for cannabis.
The word was a wild Mexican tobacco.

3578
02:41:26,430 --> 02:41:28,920
That was where.
That's what marijuana originally was.

3579
02:41:29,340 --> 02:41:30,990
Really.
So then when you called it marijuana,

3580
02:41:30,991 --> 02:41:33,570
they weren't like,
if you're talking to Mexicans about it,

3581
02:41:33,571 --> 02:41:34,404
they'd be like,
what the f like back then they'd be 

3582
02:41:35,251 --> 02:41:36,350
like,
what the fuck you talking about?

3583
02:41:36,460 --> 02:41:39,150
That's that shit.
That wild tobacco type shit.

3584
02:41:39,210 --> 02:41:40,043
Well,
they called it marijuana because 

3585
02:41:41,220 --> 02:41:43,230
cannabis was something that everybody 
had used.

3586
02:41:43,440 --> 02:41:44,880
They used it for a textile.

3587
02:41:44,880 --> 02:41:48,150
They used it for oil.
There was so many people that were using

3588
02:41:48,151 --> 02:41:52,410
it already for close canvases.
Canvas is based on the word cannabis.

3589
02:41:52,710 --> 02:41:54,420
She's.
They use different cloth.

3590
02:41:54,421 --> 02:41:55,254
It's a.
it's a crazy cloth man and it works 

3591
02:41:56,731 --> 02:41:59,100
really hard to break.
Like if you get a hold of.

3592
02:41:59,250 --> 02:42:01,910
I have a gooey.
That was a Datsun Sora.

3593
02:42:01,980 --> 02:42:04,770
Made me a Jujitsu gooey made out of 
hemp.

3594
02:42:04,771 --> 02:42:08,670
They sell these hemp keys for fucking 
things are like indestructible.

3595
02:42:09,150 --> 02:42:09,983
Yeah.
There's something about like when you 

3596
02:42:11,671 --> 02:42:12,504
take hemp and you turn it into a fiber 
or into a rather a cloth or into a 

3597
02:42:15,901 --> 02:42:18,300
paper,
it's crazy how durable it is,

3598
02:42:18,301 --> 02:42:19,134
so why didn't.
So then he got laws passed to 

3599
02:42:21,300 --> 02:42:22,650
criminalize it.
Exactly.

3600
02:42:22,680 --> 02:42:23,341
And do all that.
But yeah,

3601
02:42:23,341 --> 02:42:24,174
you had to have like a tax stamp to grow
it for him and it cut became more and 

3602
02:42:27,090 --> 02:42:28,710
increasingly more and more difficult.

3603
02:42:28,740 --> 02:42:29,520
Why w?
Why?

3604
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:32,280
So they were never able to separate it 
as a drug and a thing.

3605
02:42:32,310 --> 02:42:33,690
No,
because it's too close.

3606
02:42:33,720 --> 02:42:35,580
It's too closely related.
Genetically,

3607
02:42:35,610 --> 02:42:38,460
you know,
it's basically you could,

3608
02:42:39,270 --> 02:42:40,860
you know,
there's different strains of it.

3609
02:42:40,890 --> 02:42:43,410
They grow it where it's specifically not
psychoactive,

3610
02:42:43,770 --> 02:42:47,040
but all the male plants are not 
psychoactive.

3611
02:42:47,380 --> 02:42:48,213
So only the female plants that have the 
flowers and you can contaminate female 

3612
02:42:52,111 --> 02:42:54,900
plants and the.
There's some sort of a process that they

3613
02:42:54,901 --> 02:42:55,734
have to do when they're growing them to 
keep them from changing each other and 

3614
02:42:59,121 --> 02:43:00,000
hate each other.
Yeah,

3615
02:43:00,030 --> 02:43:02,610
they can.
You have too many males with females.

3616
02:43:02,611 --> 02:43:06,060
They can actually fuck up the females.
It's really kind of crazy,

3617
02:43:06,930 --> 02:43:11,500
but that's the only stuff,
so I guess the issue would be would have

3618
02:43:11,501 --> 02:43:12,334
somebody that was pretending they 
weren't growing the psychoactive stuff 

3619
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:16,353
and that they were only growing,
but they were also selling it as a drug 

3620
02:43:18,400 --> 02:43:19,670
and then you would have an issue are 
legal.

3621
02:43:20,600 --> 02:43:21,433
Well,
I mean,

3622
02:43:21,890 --> 02:43:22,723
you know,
when you find out like hearst putting 

3623
02:43:24,441 --> 02:43:25,850
out those stories,
you know,

3624
02:43:25,851 --> 02:43:26,684
to get his way and then you know,
big tobacco is putting all these 

3625
02:43:28,911 --> 02:43:32,870
documentaries come out like 30 years 
later of all these stories,

3626
02:43:32,871 --> 02:43:34,080
this guy was hired,
rose,

3627
02:43:34,100 --> 02:43:35,590
that one where the,
these,

3628
02:43:35,770 --> 02:43:38,420
this small group of scientists were 
like,

3629
02:43:38,900 --> 02:43:40,760
oh,
there it was from the tobacco.

3630
02:43:40,761 --> 02:43:41,594
They were putting out stories about the 
tobacco is good for you and all this 

3631
02:43:44,451 --> 02:43:45,830
kind of stuff and they going to take 
away for you.

3632
02:43:45,980 --> 02:43:50,980
And then they all dried up and now 
they're on climate change now.

3633
02:43:51,170 --> 02:43:53,720
Now those same guys,
those same organizations are putting out

3634
02:43:54,140 --> 02:43:57,110
fake news and being,
talking heads for,

3635
02:43:57,140 --> 02:43:58,840
against global warming.
It's a,

3636
02:43:58,841 --> 02:44:02,060
it's a documentary documentary on what's
called the ministers of doubt.

3637
02:44:02,090 --> 02:44:03,050
Is that it?
Yeah,

3638
02:44:03,051 --> 02:44:03,650
yeah,
yeah.

3639
02:44:03,650 --> 02:44:04,483
That's it.
Yes,

3640
02:44:04,490 --> 02:44:06,590
I think it's called ministers of doubt.
I mean so sure.

3641
02:44:06,591 --> 02:44:07,250
Yeah.
These,

3642
02:44:07,250 --> 02:44:08,083
this,
this fakeness has been happening 

3643
02:44:09,620 --> 02:44:12,950
forever,
forever and driven by money.

3644
02:44:12,980 --> 02:44:14,750
If you have a lot of people that have a 
lot of money,

3645
02:44:15,060 --> 02:44:19,680
that's why if someone becomes president 
and then wins,

3646
02:44:19,681 --> 02:44:20,514
the president elect trump and then tweet
something that's not true about him 

3647
02:44:25,411 --> 02:44:28,440
losing the popular vote because millions
of people voted illegally.

3648
02:44:28,920 --> 02:44:33,090
When you say stuff like that,
that's why people get scared and nervous

3649
02:44:33,091 --> 02:44:37,080
because there's a long history of people
who have what you're going to have.

3650
02:44:37,380 --> 02:44:39,780
Donald trump is going to have ultimate 
power.

3651
02:44:39,850 --> 02:44:40,683
Yeah.
He's going to have that position to the 

3652
02:44:42,091 --> 02:44:46,110
position of ultimate power,
but with that comes just a massive,

3653
02:44:46,111 --> 02:44:46,944
massive responsibility.
So for him to continue to do stuff like 

3654
02:44:50,491 --> 02:44:52,920
that,
which is like a strategic fib,

3655
02:44:53,160 --> 02:44:55,290
he got to kind of let all that go.
Just like he said,

3656
02:44:55,291 --> 02:44:57,240
he was going to let all of his 
businesses go is gonna,

3657
02:44:57,241 --> 02:44:59,910
let his family runs businesses.
It's going to completely step away.

3658
02:45:00,390 --> 02:45:01,223
I urge him,
let all that other stuff go to like try 

3659
02:45:05,381 --> 02:45:10,260
to try to rise to this crazy position in
one of 40.

3660
02:45:10,261 --> 02:45:11,970
How many people have been president now?

3661
02:45:12,480 --> 02:45:13,590
Busy?
Forty slash 45.

3662
02:45:13,620 --> 02:45:15,030
40 six.
40 six.

3663
02:45:15,460 --> 02:45:16,720
Yup.
Forty five.

3664
02:45:16,860 --> 02:45:19,890
40 six.
Merchants of doubt not administered.

3665
02:45:19,930 --> 02:45:21,210
Oh,
merchants of doubt.

3666
02:45:21,240 --> 02:45:22,890
Thank you.
Merchants of doubt.

3667
02:45:22,891 --> 02:45:23,724
There's a great documentary.
So when he tweets about Alec Baldwin 

3668
02:45:26,341 --> 02:45:28,170
again on Saturday night,
what does he say?

3669
02:45:28,230 --> 02:45:29,390
He said,
son watched it.

3670
02:45:29,400 --> 02:45:32,700
Tried to watch snl again.
So not funny.

3671
02:45:33,150 --> 02:45:35,250
Total fail.
Totally biased.

3672
02:45:35,290 --> 02:45:36,740
Fail.
You know,

3673
02:45:36,900 --> 02:45:39,630
man,
you gotta realize it's funny.

3674
02:45:40,020 --> 02:45:41,160
It's funny,
man.

3675
02:45:41,190 --> 02:45:44,310
Is he doing that because he doesn't want
people to talk about Taiwan.

3676
02:45:44,840 --> 02:45:46,290
This is the funny discussion.
It's like,

3677
02:45:46,380 --> 02:45:49,530
is he brilliant or is he just crazy?
That's really what we're dealing with.

3678
02:45:49,650 --> 02:45:50,483
Izzy.
So savvy that he wants to everybody not 

3679
02:45:52,291 --> 02:45:53,124
to pay attention to the Taiwan phone 
call and changing decades of how we 

3680
02:45:55,891 --> 02:46:00,540
treat Taiwan or is that way tweeted to 
divert us or is he just.

3681
02:46:00,810 --> 02:46:02,940
Taiwan was one column.
This tweet is another thing.

3682
02:46:02,970 --> 02:46:05,700
The BS that I think it's just that 
Taiwan thing,

3683
02:46:05,701 --> 02:46:07,800
he just avoided it.
Just not talk about it.

3684
02:46:07,801 --> 02:46:09,060
Like what is he doing?
What did he do?

3685
02:46:09,170 --> 02:46:09,980
Taiwan.
He,

3686
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:11,660
he contacted Taiwan.
Yeah.

3687
02:46:11,660 --> 02:46:14,960
He says they content and that's he 
tweets his defenses.

3688
02:46:15,050 --> 02:46:17,790
They called me.
Oh thanks.

3689
02:46:17,840 --> 02:46:18,673
The problem you uh,
the policy for 40 years is that you're 

3690
02:46:23,630 --> 02:46:24,463
dealing with one.
China and Taiwan wants to be their own 

3691
02:46:27,651 --> 02:46:30,950
thing and you don't treat them the same 
way that you do greater China,

3692
02:46:31,220 --> 02:46:33,300
that Taiwan is part of China.
So you.

3693
02:46:33,740 --> 02:46:38,740
So the way that the diplomats of the 
work that you're friendly with Taiwan,

3694
02:46:39,170 --> 02:46:42,110
but you don't recognize them as like 
their own government.

3695
02:46:42,111 --> 02:46:43,850
You don't invite them to the White 
House.

3696
02:46:43,851 --> 02:46:44,684
You don't.
Our leaders have never talked to their 

3697
02:46:46,310 --> 02:46:50,210
leaders.
So he gets phone call and he's like,

3698
02:46:50,330 --> 02:46:51,081
Hey,
what's up?

3699
02:46:51,081 --> 02:46:51,914
Yeah,
we're cool.

3700
02:46:52,160 --> 02:46:53,390
And then China was like,
Whoa,

3701
02:46:53,391 --> 02:46:53,991
Whoa,
Whoa,

3702
02:46:53,991 --> 02:46:54,824
wait.
We have this whole structure of the way 

3703
02:46:56,061 --> 02:46:56,894
the world works.
And in one phone call this is talking 

3704
02:46:59,130 --> 02:47:01,700
about power one receiving one phone

3705
02:47:01,730 --> 02:47:05,210
call shook that whole part of the globe.
Let me just first of all,

3706
02:47:05,211 --> 02:47:07,670
start off with China,
sounds like a dickie friend,

3707
02:47:08,630 --> 02:47:11,840
Dickie friend that wants to control you 
and we'll let you talk to other people.

3708
02:47:11,990 --> 02:47:12,823
So you wanted to make friends with this 
new guy and the new guy wants to make 

3709
02:47:14,841 --> 02:47:16,580
friends with you and China's like,
Nah,

3710
02:47:16,581 --> 02:47:17,510
fuck that.
No,

3711
02:47:17,511 --> 02:47:21,800
you don't even get to talk to them.
It's that part is pretty valid.

3712
02:47:21,801 --> 02:47:23,840
If that's everything to me,
that's everything.

3713
02:47:23,841 --> 02:47:25,240
It's all there.
Unless,

3714
02:47:25,350 --> 02:47:27,280
I mean that's something Taiwan's doing 
what?

3715
02:47:27,281 --> 02:47:29,690
We're not supposed to talk to them like 
North Korea,

3716
02:47:29,900 --> 02:47:30,733
like if all of a sudden he started to 
like chat with North Korea and started 

3717
02:47:32,541 --> 02:47:36,420
selling Taco bowls over there.
What does it say here,

3718
02:47:36,450 --> 02:47:37,283
Jamie?
This is from the Washington Post about 

3719
02:47:39,171 --> 02:47:40,004
the call.
It says the message as John Bolton 

3720
02:47:42,111 --> 02:47:45,020
correctly puts it,
was that the president of United States,

3721
02:47:45,290 --> 02:47:48,590
we'll talk to whoever he who,
whomever he wants,

3722
02:47:48,800 --> 02:47:53,240
if he thinks it's in the interest of the
United States and nobody in Beijing gets

3723
02:47:53,241 --> 02:47:57,160
to dictate to dictate rather to dictate 
who we talked to.

3724
02:47:57,500 --> 02:47:59,840
Well,
that seems to make sense to me.

3725
02:48:00,170 --> 02:48:02,990
What are we going to talk to people?
Because if we do,

3726
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,870
China gets mad.
That sounds like a shitbag relationship.

3727
02:48:05,960 --> 02:48:09,840
It's similar to Obama talking to Iran.
I've had friends like that where they go

3728
02:48:09,841 --> 02:48:10,674
like,
you can't talk to that person and look 

3729
02:48:11,510 --> 02:48:13,040
if you,
if you have an enemy,

3730
02:48:13,100 --> 02:48:16,040
I'm not going to like cozy up to someone
that's your enemy,

3731
02:48:16,430 --> 02:48:17,263
but if you don't like somebody doesn't 
necessarily mean that I don't like them 

3732
02:48:20,090 --> 02:48:20,923
just because I like you.
Like I don't have to like everybody you 

3733
02:48:22,761 --> 02:48:25,130
like,
like that sounds fucking crazy.

3734
02:48:25,131 --> 02:48:26,480
Yeah,
that's crazy.

3735
02:48:26,510 --> 02:48:27,321
Yeah.
No,

3736
02:48:27,321 --> 02:48:31,460
I mean Obama talking to Iran,
it's like,

3737
02:48:31,490 --> 02:48:33,830
well,
how is this ever going to get better and

3738
02:48:33,831 --> 02:48:36,050
less?
Our leaders talk to their leader.

3739
02:48:36,080 --> 02:48:37,100
Exactly.
You're never gonna.

3740
02:48:37,160 --> 02:48:37,993
You're never gonna get any.

3741
02:48:38,740 --> 02:48:40,170
If China tells you,
you can't talk to them.

3742
02:48:40,180 --> 02:48:43,120
Like what?
My right says who but here,

3743
02:48:43,121 --> 02:48:45,940
the thing with the thing with the phone 
call is we don't know.

3744
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:49,360
Did he just pick it up and not his.
He was he totally unaware.

3745
02:48:49,490 --> 02:48:50,790
Hey,
Brovara relationship with them.

3746
02:48:50,791 --> 02:48:52,550
He said he was brief for that phone call
and say,

3747
02:48:53,110 --> 02:48:53,470
Hey,
new.

3748
02:48:53,470 --> 02:48:55,630
He was doing.
I heard you were talking to Mike.

3749
02:48:55,660 --> 02:48:56,770
Man.
I thought we were clear.

3750
02:48:57,220 --> 02:48:58,270
You don't talk to Mike,
man.

3751
02:48:58,300 --> 02:49:00,380
What a piece of shit.
He just won't.

3752
02:49:00,420 --> 02:49:01,930
He did.
He called me.

3753
02:49:01,960 --> 02:49:02,251
No,
no,

3754
02:49:02,251 --> 02:49:03,220
no.
Mike's a piece of shit.

3755
02:49:03,221 --> 02:49:05,140
Fuck him and his whole yard.
I don't know.

3756
02:49:05,141 --> 02:49:05,990
He seems like.
Oh right.

3757
02:49:05,991 --> 02:49:08,760
I mean he just followed his.
You can't go over to his yard.

3758
02:49:08,910 --> 02:49:10,440
I don't want you to do business.
I just.

3759
02:49:11,130 --> 02:49:12,960
He's not that bad.
Fuck Mike.

3760
02:49:12,961 --> 02:49:15,170
He said some good things about you.
I'm done.

3761
02:49:15,920 --> 02:49:16,753
We're going to war.
Trying to sounds like the biggest 

3762
02:49:19,951 --> 02:49:20,784
asshole.
Can you imagine what a fucking kid like 

3763
02:49:23,910 --> 02:49:25,880
teenager,
China sounds like.

3764
02:49:25,881 --> 02:49:26,671
Well,
you can't even.

3765
02:49:26,671 --> 02:49:28,740
I can't even talk to them.
If I talk to them.

3766
02:49:28,741 --> 02:49:30,360
We're going to war.
Are we going to war?

3767
02:49:30,690 --> 02:49:33,000
Are you serious?
We're going to war over this.

3768
02:49:33,001 --> 02:49:33,834
I will totally go to war over this 
financial war called the lawyers start 

3769
02:49:38,161 --> 02:49:39,180
suing you.
What?

3770
02:49:39,270 --> 02:49:40,500
Why are you suing me?
Man?

3771
02:49:40,580 --> 02:49:45,580
I don't understand the whole.
I don't understand the whole Asia aspect

3772
02:49:46,191 --> 02:49:48,470
of our.
Of global policy at all.

3773
02:49:48,530 --> 02:49:49,620
Well,
let me tell you this.

3774
02:49:49,670 --> 02:49:51,140
I don't the UFC,

3775
02:49:51,240 --> 02:49:52,073
this is my,
what I understand about some Asian 

3776
02:49:54,031 --> 02:49:56,250
businesses are at least chip Japanese 
businesses.

3777
02:49:56,460 --> 02:50:00,330
The UFC bought this company called pride
and a boy,

3778
02:50:00,360 --> 02:50:02,790
they get hoodwinked.
Oh my goodness.

3779
02:50:02,820 --> 02:50:05,370
The way they did it was wonderful.
First of all,

3780
02:50:05,490 --> 02:50:06,323
the way that the Japanese have this 
masterful way of negotiating business 

3781
02:50:10,740 --> 02:50:13,350
where they talk to you about like,
maybe we'll do business,

3782
02:50:13,470 --> 02:50:14,303
we're thinking about doing business,
not today and maybe we'll come back and 

3783
02:50:18,210 --> 02:50:20,820
discuss this at a later date and then 
they would come back.

3784
02:50:20,821 --> 02:50:21,654
What we're really thinking about selling
his business and then the UFC and pride 

3785
02:50:24,781 --> 02:50:28,200
started trading fighters.
They did like a goodwill gesture.

3786
02:50:28,520 --> 02:50:29,353
So what this did was elevate the brand 
of pride and make print pride even 

3787
02:50:33,211 --> 02:50:35,970
bigger in the United States.
Like they had family Silva come over and

3788
02:50:35,971 --> 02:50:36,804
he faced off with chocolate and 
chocolate l went over there to fight 

3789
02:50:39,091 --> 02:50:39,924
people and they had all this negotiating
stuff going on for a long time and then 

3790
02:50:43,741 --> 02:50:45,780
finally the UFC comes in and buys them 
out.

3791
02:50:45,990 --> 02:50:48,570
This big historic thing,
take photos,

3792
02:50:48,630 --> 02:50:51,510
shaking hands.
Turns out they bought nothing.

3793
02:50:51,870 --> 02:50:56,870
What they bought was essentially like a,
a library of fights.

3794
02:50:57,810 --> 02:51:00,690
All the contracts that the fighters had,
they're all bad.

3795
02:51:00,720 --> 02:51:04,410
They're all illegal and invalid.
They had like a couple of contracts,

3796
02:51:04,590 --> 02:51:06,480
some guys that they had to take over and
like,

3797
02:51:06,481 --> 02:51:08,340
oh Jesus Christ,
like it was just chaos.

3798
02:51:08,341 --> 02:51:09,174
But as far as they were going to like 
run that business over there where they 

3799
02:51:11,731 --> 02:51:13,170
got over there and they're like,
oh my God,

3800
02:51:13,171 --> 02:51:15,900
we can't run this.
Like you can't run it without the Yakuza

3801
02:51:16,290 --> 02:51:17,123
people that were all like,
you have to have the consent of the 

3802
02:51:18,931 --> 02:51:21,480
Japanese mom to run the country company 
over there.

3803
02:51:21,780 --> 02:51:24,120
And like that was like one of the 
Chinese know Japanese,

3804
02:51:24,121 --> 02:51:24,900
Japanese,
Japanese.

3805
02:51:24,900 --> 02:51:25,733
That was one of the things that sunk the
organization when it was publicly 

3806
02:51:27,691 --> 02:51:28,524
released,
allegedly allegedly that the Yakuza was 

3807
02:51:31,201 --> 02:51:32,460
involved.
Everybody was like,

3808
02:51:32,461 --> 02:51:34,770
ah,
but they went over there,

3809
02:51:34,771 --> 02:51:36,660
they bought this,
they got this library,

3810
02:51:36,661 --> 02:51:38,910
and then while they had these UFC 
employees,

3811
02:51:39,180 --> 02:51:40,013
the employees all started a new business
called dream and they just fucking 

3812
02:51:43,510 --> 02:51:45,510
started up with a whole new thing of 
nowhere.

3813
02:51:45,780 --> 02:51:46,613
So they weren't like.
They bought pride and pride is dead in 

3814
02:51:49,100 --> 02:51:50,520
the same Japanese people like,
no,

3815
02:51:50,521 --> 02:51:51,720
we have dream,
and they're like,

3816
02:51:51,721 --> 02:51:53,970
but hey,
you guys were working for us.

3817
02:51:54,490 --> 02:51:57,090
Our show.
What the fuck is this?

3818
02:51:57,710 --> 02:52:00,060
It's like they bought,
they bought like air.

3819
02:52:00,130 --> 02:52:00,963
You know,
maybe we are all unknowable to each 

3820
02:52:02,741 --> 02:52:06,160
other and this is why this is part of 
Brexit went down,

3821
02:52:06,160 --> 02:52:06,993
is part of why trump won.
This is why Italy just hit their prime 

3822
02:52:09,581 --> 02:52:12,700
ministers now leaving populist vote.
Everybody wants.

3823
02:52:12,740 --> 02:52:16,690
Everyone's like being told we've got to 
deal with the whole world.

3824
02:52:16,691 --> 02:52:17,524
Globalization.
We had to deal with everybody and 

3825
02:52:18,740 --> 02:52:20,720
everyone's starting to say,
you know,

3826
02:52:20,740 --> 02:52:24,190
it's not really helping us.
Do we have to talk to the Chinese?

3827
02:52:24,191 --> 02:52:28,840
Do we have to deal with everybody or do 
we have to all be one Europe?

3828
02:52:29,250 --> 02:52:31,150
Everybody is starting to kind of 
retreat.

3829
02:52:31,151 --> 02:52:34,470
Maybe globalization is an idea on the 
paper.

3830
02:52:34,480 --> 02:52:39,100
Seems like it'll work,
but practically it's not taking hold.

3831
02:52:39,190 --> 02:52:41,080
We're all going to communicate through 
Tesla,

3832
02:52:41,081 --> 02:52:41,914
hive mind because in the future 
everyone's going to have to have an 

3833
02:52:43,841 --> 02:52:44,674
electric car and Tesla is going to be 
the first to figure out that the best 

3834
02:52:47,051 --> 02:52:49,720
way to pilot your car is actually with a
headset,

3835
02:52:49,840 --> 02:52:51,070
so you're going to put on a headset.

3836
02:52:51,070 --> 02:52:54,850
Very light knows electrodes.
They're all be bluetooth to your car and

3837
02:52:54,851 --> 02:52:55,684
that thing will operate by your mind,
but the best way it would probably be 

3838
02:52:58,991 --> 02:53:03,790
wise to do that is you've got to be on 
Google hive minds network,

3839
02:53:04,140 --> 02:53:04,973
so then you download the thoughts or you
project the thoughts through the head 

3840
02:53:08,131 --> 02:53:12,220
gear as pure intention so everybody 
knows where everybody's going as they're

3841
02:53:12,221 --> 02:53:13,054
driving because you can see pure 
intention from a mile away and that 

3842
02:53:15,881 --> 02:53:18,010
becomes a universal language of human 
beings.

3843
02:53:18,220 --> 02:53:19,053
When they realize the flaws of English 
and Spanish and Chinese and Dutch or 

3844
02:53:21,760 --> 02:53:22,593
Japanese and Korean and no one can 
understand what the fuck they were 

3845
02:53:23,981 --> 02:53:27,610
talking about through through Google 
hive mind.

3846
02:53:27,670 --> 02:53:30,130
This is connected to the Tesla as it 
drives around.

3847
02:53:30,220 --> 02:53:32,590
Is this,
is this an in the next update?

3848
02:53:32,620 --> 02:53:35,820
Whereas this in one more hit of that,
take another hit of that.

3849
02:53:36,210 --> 02:53:39,250
You'll have some good ideas.
One more hit of the.

3850
02:53:39,251 --> 02:53:41,650
I don't even know what the name.
I didn't even ask names or pot anymore.

3851
02:53:41,651 --> 02:53:43,480
It's all ridiculous.
Yeah.

3852
02:53:43,481 --> 02:53:44,314
I was pretty blown away.
I really felt like an old man in a pot 

3853
02:53:46,721 --> 02:53:48,490
shop.
Like so wait.

3854
02:53:48,660 --> 02:53:49,700
She was like,
this is.

3855
02:53:49,780 --> 02:53:52,820
This is a King Kong or something,
and I was in.

3856
02:53:52,960 --> 02:53:54,100
I was like,
oh,

3857
02:53:54,101 --> 02:53:56,710
everybody knows this name.
I didn't realize.

3858
02:53:56,711 --> 02:53:58,720
I thought this was your own little 
brand.

3859
02:53:58,750 --> 02:53:59,583
I was so lost.
They wouldn't let my mom in a pot shop 

3860
02:54:02,350 --> 02:54:05,410
and she never.
She never id good for them.

3861
02:54:05,660 --> 02:54:07,360
You have to have laws.
Yeah.

3862
02:54:07,361 --> 02:54:08,650
I think she's legal folks.

3863
02:54:10,740 --> 02:54:14,410
I mean it's flattering and everything.
I'm sure she was happy.

3864
02:54:14,810 --> 02:54:15,643
Yeah,
I think they have to mark down who you 

3865
02:54:17,591 --> 02:54:19,720
are.
They didn't pay.

3866
02:54:19,730 --> 02:54:21,940
Didn't know.
They just looked at your shit bro.

3867
02:54:21,941 --> 02:54:23,170
You don't even know Bro.
Oh,

3868
02:54:23,171 --> 02:54:27,520
maybe bro.
Bro.

3869
02:54:27,521 --> 02:54:29,620
You're right,
Tom.

3870
02:54:30,690 --> 02:54:32,140
We just did three hours,
man.

3871
02:54:32,530 --> 02:54:34,570
We did already know.
Yup.

3872
02:54:34,780 --> 02:54:35,613
This is a time where.
This is part of the hive mentality is 

3873
02:54:38,230 --> 02:54:40,360
we're missing this place.
That's what happens.

3874
02:54:40,361 --> 02:54:41,620
It's weird.
It is.

3875
02:54:41,770 --> 02:54:45,100
I'm worried that if we moved studios we 
will lose that magic of three hours just

3876
02:54:45,101 --> 02:54:46,840
disappearing.
When did you move out?

3877
02:54:47,200 --> 02:54:48,033
I don't know,
bro.

3878
02:54:48,150 --> 02:54:49,220
Bra.
We're working on it,

3879
02:54:49,270 --> 02:54:50,980
bro.
Brown moved to Sherman oaks,

3880
02:54:51,550 --> 02:54:53,100
Bro.
Go to Sherman oaks.

3881
02:54:53,340 --> 02:54:55,240
They get about it now I'm thinking.
No,

3882
02:54:56,270 --> 02:54:57,103
come on in.
There's lots of good space in Sherman 

3883
02:54:58,781 --> 02:55:00,430
oaks.
Right by my Friday night.

3884
02:55:00,490 --> 02:55:02,210
Tom Papa on epics.

3885
02:55:03,140 --> 02:55:04,550
What time?
The new specials?

3886
02:55:04,640 --> 02:55:05,570
Uh,
8:00

3887
02:55:05,571 --> 02:55:08,980
I think.
And epics isn't like on Directv,

3888
02:55:09,470 --> 02:55:13,340
but uh,
everybody can get epics for free for the

3889
02:55:13,340 --> 02:55:14,173
month.
You can watch on your phone or your 

3890
02:55:14,811 --> 02:55:15,644
laptop or whatever.
I'll just go to [inaudible] dot com and 

3891
02:55:17,031 --> 02:55:19,250
you'll be able to check it out to your 
special.

3892
02:55:19,251 --> 02:55:21,440
And then there's a lot of other specials
too that are on epix.

3893
02:55:21,680 --> 02:55:24,110
Jim Norton and I know as a Marin has 
special.

3894
02:55:24,410 --> 02:55:25,243
All those are available as well online.
Like you can check them out on the 

3895
02:55:28,161 --> 02:55:32,330
website for sure.
And then it goes to itunes next week.

3896
02:55:32,480 --> 02:55:33,560
Well,
I can't wait to check it out,

3897
02:55:33,561 --> 02:55:34,820
brother.
I appreciate it.

3898
02:55:34,821 --> 02:55:36,170
Thanks a lot,
man.

3899
02:55:36,230 --> 02:55:38,060
Motherfucking Papa.
Ladies and gentlemen,

3900
02:55:38,100 --> 02:55:39,920
maybe Instagram,
twitter,

3901
02:55:40,370 --> 02:55:45,170
facebook bakery near yourself before you
wreck yourself inside.

3902
02:55:45,171 --> 02:55:45,981
Joke.
All right folks,

3903
02:55:45,981 --> 02:55:48,710
thank you.
See You tomorrow by tomorrow.

3904
02:55:49,190 --> 02:55:50,023
That's a good one.
