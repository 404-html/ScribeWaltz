1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,470
Just trying to recall anything.

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:09,963
Hello.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,193
Hello.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,153
Hi.

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,430
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the flashlight.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,700
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on
the link for the flashlight and enter in

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,690
the code name Brogan,

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,310
you will get 15% off the
number one sex toy from men.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,270
Clean it.

10
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,680
Don't forget to wash it out.

11
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:29,010
Don't forget to wash it.

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,010
So this is what's going on folks.

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,100
We're sitting here around waiting
for Graham Hancock to get here.

14
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,150
He was doing some sort of
a seminar in Orange County.

15
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,361
And so,

16
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:40,560
uh,

17
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,940
that's like at least an hour away.

18
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,650
So don't get an I instead of just
sitting here staring at each other,

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,230
decided to stare at each other online.

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,060
So that is the,

21
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,661
that's the,

22
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:52,080
um,

23
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,940
the basic motivation for this podcast.

24
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:54,973
Yup.

25
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,080
I ended up by getting out here.

26
00:00:57,081 --> 00:00:57,801
It's crazy,

27
00:00:57,801 --> 00:00:58,101
man.

28
00:00:58,101 --> 00:00:59,090
I ended up in some,

29
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,870
my gps took me in a bad direction as time.

30
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,940
You're out in the middle and nowhere,

31
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:05,181
man,

32
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:06,014
I ended up

33
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:07,260
okay

34
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,140
in a place that was like
the surface of the moon.

35
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,300
I don't know where the fuck it was.

36
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,551
Spooky.

37
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:15,301
It was spooky.

38
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:18,870
Like I could have gone off a cliff and
no one would have found me for a week.

39
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:19,681
He'd be fine too.

40
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:20,514
Don't worry about it.

41
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,503
You're tweaking.

42
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:21,961
Stop.

43
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:22,411
You're tweaking,

44
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:22,671
son.

45
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:23,970
We're tweaking bro.

46
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,790
You scared of nature tariff.

47
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,110
Now I'm not scared of nature,

48
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:29,940
but I am scared at night when I'm,

49
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,150
when you're going around like
winding curves through math country,

50
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:38,151
I'm not exactly like exactly comfortable
those Carly's lives out there.

51
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,840
This is a lot of people live out there,

52
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,460
but my window space,

53
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,730
they like to be away from each other.

54
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,020
I like space.

55
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,520
Why do people assume that?

56
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:50,060
But there's a strange thing why people
assume that when someone wants to be a

57
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:53,000
way that they want the want
some space between you and them,

58
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:55,190
there's something creepy about him all
day and you're out there and fucking

59
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:56,600
cooking math and you know,

60
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,980
you're automatically assume.

61
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,900
Why is that cabin by itself?

62
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:02,240
Would that chimney blowing smoke?

63
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:03,650
What the fuck are they cooking in there?

64
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,490
Yeah.

65
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:04,731
You know,

66
00:02:04,731 --> 00:02:06,130
you don't look at it
and go look at that guy.

67
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,180
He's out there just doing it by himself.

68
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:09,014
Chopping Wood.

69
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,261
No.

70
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:09,521
Yes.

71
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:13,490
Assume automatically that some creepy
thing is going on out there and if he's by

72
00:02:13,491 --> 00:02:13,920
himself,

73
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,580
when traditionally they're creepy people
are the ones who live underneath you on

74
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:18,414
your apartment.

75
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,160
There was a real creep.

76
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:22,230
So once you're masturbating
to your footsteps,

77
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,870
but step fetish,

78
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,060
yes,

79
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,100
there was a documentary,

80
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:29,731
you know that,

81
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:29,940
um,

82
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,500
vbs.tv.

83
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,533
You know what I'm saying?

84
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,970
The,

85
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,380
I wouldn't call it a documentary,

86
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:35,370
I guess I'd call it a a,

87
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,660
an episode where they went and they went
and visited this guy who lives in like

88
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,450
northern eastern Alaska.

89
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:45,210
He lives like way the fuck up there.

90
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,040
They have to drop him off supplies and
he lives in this little tiny shack and

91
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,320
he's like one of the few people
that's allowed to live there.

92
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,970
And he's been there for like 20 years.

93
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,180
This dude never even saw nine 11.

94
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,860
He never saw the towers go down.

95
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,180
He'd like heard that
something had happened.

96
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,760
He's so removed from everything.

97
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,440
He's got like a little generated.

98
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,300
It's sometimes he powers up a TV,

99
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:07,661
but,

100
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:09,430
and he's got movies that they watch.

101
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,061
But dude,

102
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:15,061
this guy's living in the woods in a tiny
one room house with his wife who looks

103
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:17,200
like some sort of an Eskimo,

104
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,100
you know,

105
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,610
type of woman and uh,

106
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,250
they're fucking happy shit up there.

107
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,350
He says that hunting and gathering,

108
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:25,400
it's like what keeps you
happy and that's what,

109
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,470
what keeps him happy.

110
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:28,570
He's out there shooting
Caribou and following them.

111
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,141
I mean,

112
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:29,591
it's fucking,

113
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:30,310
dude loves it.

114
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,360
He loves living up there.

115
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,440
It sounds great that he had a shoot a
bear on one of the episodes because the

116
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:38,860
bear had came too close to his house
and the bear bear's killed her dogs and

117
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:39,694
shit.

118
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,750
So it's the middle of the night.

119
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:44,290
They're running after this guy with a
camera and he's running through the woods

120
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,970
with a fucking shotgun and a boom,

121
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,070
boom.

122
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:52,240
He just blowing holes into this fucking
bear and chasing it down while they're

123
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:55,570
all chasing after him with cameras in
the middle of the night in the woods in

124
00:03:55,571 --> 00:03:56,404
Alaska.

125
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:57,700
Dude,

126
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,810
it's gnarly.

127
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,670
It's,

128
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,001
it's,

129
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:01,421
it's a,

130
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:03,020
it's amazing footage too.

131
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,341
It's a,

132
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:07,930
it's such an interesting
insight to someone who would
choose to live that life.

133
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,620
You know,

134
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,060
which seems so horrifying to us.

135
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:13,800
But to him like our life
is just fucking mundane.

136
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,650
There's nothing to it.

137
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,860
You just can't get excited.

138
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,490
I don't think it's horrifying.

139
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:17,890
I,

140
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,400
I think it sounds amazing.

141
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:24,460
I mean there's something about being self
sufficient that seems like it feels so

142
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:28,320
incredibly good to be
completely off the grid.

143
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:30,480
And now that if the,

144
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,980
if everything fell apart,

145
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,350
your life would barely shift at all.

146
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,061
Yeah.

147
00:04:35,061 --> 00:04:35,781
That's interesting.

148
00:04:35,781 --> 00:04:36,081
Right?

149
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:36,591
But that's like,

150
00:04:36,591 --> 00:04:39,410
is that like instincts
to not join the system?

151
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:39,770
I mean,

152
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,491
is that what that is?

153
00:04:40,491 --> 00:04:43,220
Is that some sort of a
resistance of the hive,

154
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,641
you know,

155
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:46,130
that would feel good to
not need all these people,

156
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:46,410
you know?

157
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,360
Isn't that ridiculous?

158
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:49,190
Because the reason why
everything is so awesome,

159
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:52,730
the reason why society in general so
awesome is because millions of people

160
00:04:52,731 --> 00:04:56,540
contributed to make this one colossal
thing that relies on millions of people.

161
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,560
But it,

162
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,840
but because all these
other people are involved,

163
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,710
it's fucking awesome.

164
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:01,544
It's amazing.

165
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,200
It's got some terrible parts about it too.

166
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:06,410
But the idea itself and what
can be accomplished with it,

167
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:07,460
it's fucking amazing.

168
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,610
So why do we want to not need that?

169
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,420
Why do we want,

170
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:16,420
do we want to keep the option open to be
a cunt so you can just fucking fuck off

171
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:19,700
and just going to go live off
Caribou in the middle of nowhere?

172
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,720
Well that's that.

173
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,650
That's like the argument.

174
00:05:21,651 --> 00:05:21,891
You know,

175
00:05:21,891 --> 00:05:24,620
like people have that
argument against monks.

176
00:05:24,621 --> 00:05:26,360
Like when someone goes and becomes a monk,

177
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:27,200
it's the same argument.

178
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,010
It's like,

179
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,671
what are you doing?

180
00:05:28,671 --> 00:05:33,620
You're ignoring all of society
to go and do and be a monk.

181
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:36,920
Isn't it better to be in the world
than it is to go and isolate yourself?

182
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:39,200
How if you do go and
isolate yourself or you,

183
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,820
so whatever you learn,

184
00:05:40,821 --> 00:05:41,331
you're still,

185
00:05:41,331 --> 00:05:43,250
it's not applicable to
people in the world,

186
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,301
but some monks,

187
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:45,470
I don't think they give a shit.

188
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:46,220
I,

189
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:46,521
you know,

190
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:47,820
some people they just don't care.

191
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:48,470
They're,

192
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,720
they're not concerned with the society.

193
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:51,230
They don't,

194
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:55,280
it doesn't make any difference to them
whether they're contributing or not.

195
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:56,120
Like who cares?

196
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,500
Yeah,

197
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,160
I hear you man.

198
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,791
I know what you're saying.

199
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,310
I've had that thought
in my head about monks.

200
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:01,551
You know,

201
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:02,030
like,

202
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,500
like what,

203
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:02,601
what,

204
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:02,711
what,

205
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:03,590
what kind of a loser?

206
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,190
Just where's the fucking orange robe
and never beats off and just hides and

207
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:08,024
chance all day.

208
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:08,480
Like,

209
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,691
dude,

210
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:10,580
you're missing out on muscle cars.

211
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:11,570
Blow jobs,

212
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,770
great movies.

213
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,340
We'd Khakis.

214
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,110
Um,

215
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,441
you know,

216
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:15,660
you're,

217
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,260
you're missing out on killer restaurants.

218
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,020
You mentioned down on shit talking.

219
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,470
It's like you're missing
out on astral projection.

220
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,150
You can't send your spirit to the higher
dimensional planes to communicate with

221
00:06:28,151 --> 00:06:32,320
the supreme gods or
third eye's sealed shut.

222
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,110
You have no idea about the,

223
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,380
what it feels like to be completely in
tune vibrating with the harmony of the

224
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:39,160
universe.

225
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,993
You're just,

226
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,860
you're just humping your leg humping down
there and the city while I'm floating

227
00:06:44,861 --> 00:06:47,200
around the eternal paradise,

228
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,423
uh,

229
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,470
outside of time and space and
then like here or transcend them.

230
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,313
Bliss.

231
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,470
Do you think there's a monk
who could talk that good shit?

232
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,540
If there a model that you talk like that,

233
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,570
say things like that,

234
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:01,280
that guy should like be doing tours,

235
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,360
you know,

236
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,070
he would recruit monks
like left and right.

237
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:04,910
You can change the world.

238
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,370
If a guy could speak that
way about being a monk?

239
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:07,881
Yeah,

240
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:08,490
well they,

241
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:08,781
they,

242
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:08,861
uh,

243
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,550
I think what theoretically,

244
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:12,870
what may happen is that as,

245
00:07:12,871 --> 00:07:17,871
as you evolve and begin to
like open your or is up,

246
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:19,730
and this is purely theoretical,

247
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:22,910
but I think that you begin to
extinguish the desire to eat,

248
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,773
to tour.

249
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,110
You extinguish the desire to do,

250
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,420
to,

251
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,790
to perform.

252
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,140
You don't want to do that anymore.

253
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:33,650
You're just kind of in another place
all together you've zoomed out.

254
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:36,530
It's like Google maps use
zoom so far out that year.

255
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,050
So you're saying that the more you
would go down the road of meditation,

256
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,210
the less you would want to do
standup comedy or you're saying,

257
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,550
is that what you mean by tour?

258
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,501
Yeah,

259
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:45,651
well,

260
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:45,921
no.

261
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:46,161
Yeah,

262
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:47,180
I mean like the show,

263
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:48,080
like the uh,

264
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,160
exhibitionism,

265
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:49,551
you know,

266
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:49,901
like the,

267
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:54,350
the for you were saying somebody you talk
like that she should tour and talk to

268
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:54,830
people.

269
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,041
Oh,

270
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,870
I'm saying someone who talks like that,

271
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:57,940
you know,

272
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,870
and it's all a theory.

273
00:07:58,871 --> 00:07:59,321
It's an all,

274
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:01,130
it's a theoretical idea.

275
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:01,964
But,

276
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,300
uh,

277
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:02,571
the,

278
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:03,230
you know,

279
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:07,530
the assumption when someone becomes
a renunciate I think is that they're,

280
00:08:07,531 --> 00:08:08,151
they're not,

281
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:09,740
they're not experiencing happiness.

282
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,010
Right,

283
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:10,490
right.

284
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,920
When it may be that the thing
that they're experiencing,

285
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:17,060
it's a million times better than what
they were experiencing in the world.

286
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,480
Well,

287
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,430
I know for a fact that I have achieved
at least bizarre states of consciousness

288
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:22,831
just from,

289
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:23,664
from yoga.

290
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,081
I,

291
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:24,351
uh,

292
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:25,340
I remember one time,

293
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:25,810
uh,

294
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,560
I was in New York and I was real nervous.

295
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:28,101
I had to do,

296
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:28,700
uh,

297
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,230
the Howard stern show the next day.

298
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,700
It was first time I
ever did it and no one,

299
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:34,070
I was genuinely nervous
and I couldn't sleep.

300
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:39,340
So it was in my hotel room reading off
of this ancient yoga book and doing these

301
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:39,951
poses.

302
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:42,020
And I did yoga for like
an hour and a half.

303
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,670
And at the end of it I felt fucking great.

304
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,270
I mean,

305
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,290
I didn't just feel great.

306
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,370
I felt high.

307
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,300
I felt,

308
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,080
frankly,

309
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,400
my body was like,

310
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,110
I felt team goals,

311
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,100
like a glowing tingle.

312
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,521
I mean,

313
00:08:56,521 --> 00:09:00,810
I did this intense yoga
routine for an hour and a half.

314
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,100
And when it was over,

315
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:05,250
my body had just stretch everything out,

316
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,120
released,

317
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,700
all the tension opened up,

318
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,870
all the,

319
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:10,151
the,

320
00:09:10,151 --> 00:09:11,430
the whatever the fuck it is.

321
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,600
You want to call it shock rose.

322
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:13,720
You want to call it senses,

323
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:14,460
you want to call it,

324
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:14,701
you know,

325
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:14,941
your,

326
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:15,211
your,

327
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:15,481
your,

328
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:15,781
your,

329
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:16,081
your,

330
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:16,471
whatever.

331
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:19,310
Your ability to tune in to
what's around you was all,

332
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,960
it was just cranked to 10 and I was like,

333
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:22,510
wow,

334
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,430
if this was a drug of this feeling
like an intense yoga workout,

335
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,170
you know,

336
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,330
it can feel very much
like a real mild pot,

337
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,150
you know,

338
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,070
like Whoa,

339
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,940
like nothing.

340
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,900
Nothing that's going to make you fucking
drive shitty or forget your keys.

341
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,360
But sometimes it's going
to make you just a little,

342
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:39,841
just a,

343
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:40,321
wow.

344
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:41,400
I feel a little better.

345
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,170
I feel a little more relaxed.

346
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:44,370
I feel a little sensitive.

347
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:44,880
I feel,

348
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,713
I feel good.

349
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,041
Yeah.

350
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:46,581
Well that's a,

351
00:09:46,581 --> 00:09:46,971
you know,

352
00:09:46,971 --> 00:09:48,380
that company that's,

353
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:52,520
I felt that too from yoga and I felt that
from chanting and I felt that from any

354
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:54,950
kind of ritualistic thing that has,

355
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:55,531
you know,

356
00:09:55,531 --> 00:09:57,080
a spiritual undertones to it,

357
00:09:57,081 --> 00:09:58,310
which I think yoga does.

358
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:58,670
Okay.

359
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,170
You got deep into chanting,

360
00:10:00,171 --> 00:10:00,471
right,

361
00:10:00,471 --> 00:10:00,980
didn't you?

362
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,140
You got at one point in time you were,

363
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,650
you know,

364
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,130
you,

365
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:04,430
you,

366
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:04,821
you like,

367
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:06,860
you can chant out that fucking crazy.

368
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,240
I got deep into it.

369
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,471
What is that thing that you,

370
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:10,304
you busted out?

371
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,300
Bad thing is that,

372
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,800
that's a Hari Krishna prayer.

373
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:17,660
That's a prayer that you read before
that you say before you're going to read

374
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:19,430
the Bhagavad Gita and it means,

375
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:21,140
are you Christians read the Bhagavad Gita?

376
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,711
Oh yeah.

377
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:23,120
That's our primary text.

378
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,890
That and the stream on bog of a time.

379
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,640
Whoa.

380
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,473
But the,

381
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:26,781
yeah,

382
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:28,070
you say that prayer.

383
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,203
Um,

384
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,680
and they have a bunch of other texts too.

385
00:10:30,681 --> 00:10:30,891
I mean,

386
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:31,724
they're really,

387
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,640
that's how they spend most of
their time is studying the Vedas.

388
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:34,780
Yeah.

389
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:38,830
So there know almost nothing about the
Hari Krishna is all I know that when,

390
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:39,050
uh,

391
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:39,910
when I was a kid,

392
00:10:39,911 --> 00:10:41,530
people made fun of the Hari Krishna,

393
00:10:41,531 --> 00:10:43,040
so it was like a stock joke.

394
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:43,581
Oh,

395
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:44,414
sure.

396
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:44,601
Oh.

397
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:46,280
And in movies to an airplane.

398
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:49,190
And so many movies they get made fun of
because they would go and hang out at

399
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:49,911
the airports.

400
00:10:49,911 --> 00:10:53,570
And then these guys in saffron
robes with shaved heads,

401
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:53,930
right?

402
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,820
So it's like he,

403
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:55,730
we try to sell books,

404
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:56,240
right?

405
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,511
Yeah.

406
00:10:56,511 --> 00:10:57,020
They tried to,

407
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,700
they tried to sell books and so there's
a lot of reasons that they did get made

408
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:02,534
fun of.

409
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,370
And it was like,

410
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,031
for me,

411
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:05,870
what happened to me was,

412
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,210
um,

413
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,970
well there's also a
bunch of legal cases too,

414
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:08,660
right?

415
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,930
Weren't there like real life scenarios?

416
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:11,860
Oh yeah.

417
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,060
It's organized religion,

418
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:13,390
man.

419
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:13,550
And,

420
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,080
and it's hardcore organized
religion that recommends,

421
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,310
um,

422
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,611
you know,

423
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,870
renouncing the world.

424
00:11:19,871 --> 00:11:20,161
Like it,

425
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:20,491
it,

426
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:22,270
it doesn't tip toe around the fact,

427
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,980
like it's hardcore into the idea that the,

428
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,740
uh,

429
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,230
the way to live if you
really want to be happy,

430
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:33,130
is to let go of all the things
of the world and start chanting,

431
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:33,580
uh,

432
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,880
the Hari Krishna Maha Mantra and the,

433
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:37,331
the,

434
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:38,080
um,

435
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,290
uh,

436
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:43,290
but it's very important to realize that
that mantra is not owned by Iskcon,

437
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:45,160
which is the Hari Krishna is,

438
00:11:45,161 --> 00:11:50,161
that's like the Catholic Church
for this sect of Hinduism,

439
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,733
um,

440
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,130
which is known Bhakti Yoga.

441
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,310
So there's a lot of different
schools of thought in it.

442
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:02,311
And it's a very deep philosophy that
has its roots in the idea that there is,

443
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:03,724
um,

444
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,990
that God,

445
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,970
everything comes from God.

446
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:11,971
And so the word Krishna means translates
into the reservoir of all pleasure.

447
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,740
So it's the idea is like all pleasure,

448
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,540
all opulence,

449
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,770
all happiness,

450
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,160
everything springs from some source,

451
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:23,950
like the big bang except
the spiritual big bang.

452
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:28,570
And this is that they believe that this
is an intelligent force in the universe

453
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:30,880
that has specific qualities.

454
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:36,060
And so people are kind of born with this
case of Amnesia where they've forgotten

455
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,650
that this even exists.

456
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:42,280
And so they begin to become attracted
to these qualities and different things.

457
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:44,380
So people are attracted to beauty,

458
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:46,000
people are attracted to intelligence,

459
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:47,410
people are attracted to wealth,

460
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:49,450
people are attracted to um,

461
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:50,290
strength.

462
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,530
But they say that these
are just the sort of the,

463
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,011
uh,

464
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:58,840
what people are seeing as the qualities
of the supreme being reflected through

465
00:12:58,841 --> 00:12:59,860
the material universe.

466
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:01,300
And that's what people are attracted to.

467
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,120
And so by the specific
process of Bhakti Yoga,

468
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,590
you begin to turn your,

469
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,610
uh,

470
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:11,280
your senses back towards the original
source of all this stuff through this

471
00:13:11,281 --> 00:13:11,891
very,

472
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:16,510
very strict discipline of
chanting not eating meat.

473
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,500
Um,

474
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,920
they recommend the,

475
00:13:18,921 --> 00:13:21,010
the monks that where the rubs,

476
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,010
it's called the four
regulative principles.

477
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,850
So you don't eat meat,

478
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,790
you don't use any intoxicants,

479
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,610
no sex and no gambling.

480
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,650
You wake up at four every morning,

481
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,690
four 30 every morning.

482
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,680
You chant I think 16
rounds of this mantra,

483
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:39,251
Hari Krishna,

484
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:39,761
Hari Krishna,

485
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:40,061
Krishna,

486
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:40,361
Krishna,

487
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:40,511
Yada,

488
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:40,721
Yada,

489
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:40,931
Yada.

490
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:41,830
It all mounted on Ron,

491
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:46,831
Ron Manati and you study and you will
live in a temple and that's how you spend

492
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:48,160
your life.

493
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,350
And that's like a,

494
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,800
and you're still in the Bhagavad Gita.

495
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,940
You're studying the Vedas,

496
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:52,721
the Bhagavad Gita,

497
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:56,920
and the Shreem ABOG of a Tom and
all these other religious texts.

498
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:58,120
And you get deep,

499
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,350
deep,

500
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,370
deep into it,

501
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:02,500
to the point where you complete,

502
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:05,470
I mean they were recommend in,

503
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,060
as I recall there,

504
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:08,260
it's like your fee,

505
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,060
even your family,

506
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,630
your family is just a,

507
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,400
your is your Karma,

508
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:12,890
your fan,

509
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,590
like your attachment to your family.

510
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,210
It's just your Karma.

511
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,140
It's like,

512
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,120
let go of all those attachments,

513
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:24,190
surrender to this higher force and
then you'll experience transcend the

514
00:14:24,191 --> 00:14:24,731
happiness.

515
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:27,790
And the ultimate goal in life
is to try to connect with God.

516
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,830
That's the only reason to be alive.

517
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:32,500
And if you're not
engaged in that activity,

518
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,390
then you're miserable.

519
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,380
Then you're not really experiencing
the type of happiness that,

520
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:40,600
and even if you think you're
experiencing happiness,

521
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,550
it's nothing compared to what
you can obtain from a living,

522
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,660
a spiritual life and chanting this
mantra and what happened to me.

523
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,740
But this is what you are
not saying is your opinion.

524
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:52,070
You're saying

525
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,530
this is what,

526
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:52,801
no,

527
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:53,221
that's not,

528
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:53,461
you know,

529
00:14:53,461 --> 00:14:54,330
it's a summary of,

530
00:14:54,331 --> 00:14:54,721
of it.

531
00:14:54,721 --> 00:14:55,770
It's not my opinion,

532
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,750
but what happened to me,

533
00:14:57,751 --> 00:14:59,610
you're saying it like almost
like in the first person,

534
00:14:59,611 --> 00:15:00,880
like Oh yeah,

535
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:01,061
that,

536
00:15:01,061 --> 00:15:01,270
I mean,

537
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:01,411
yeah,

538
00:15:01,411 --> 00:15:02,280
I'm just explaining it.

539
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:03,000
I mean I'm a,

540
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,050
I don't really believe that though,

541
00:15:04,051 --> 00:15:04,884
right?

542
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:05,371
No,

543
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,510
I mean I'm a comedian.

544
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:10,260
I was like just smoking in front
of the House of Blues Drunk.

545
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:10,771
I'm not,

546
00:15:10,771 --> 00:15:11,604
I'm not like,

547
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,860
have you ever considered that?

548
00:15:13,861 --> 00:15:15,660
Maybe that would be a path that you would,

549
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:20,520
you would get so interested in it
because you are interested in all those

550
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:22,080
principles you are interested in.

551
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:22,621
Well yeah,

552
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,150
I'll tell you your
consciousness and truth.

553
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:26,060
Have you ever thought about
doing something like join?

554
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:26,720
Well,

555
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,650
what happened was,

556
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:27,921
uh,

557
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:28,910
when I got into the heart,

558
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,060
when I got into the Hari Krishna
is what happened to me was,

559
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:32,894
um,

560
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,970
cause you know when you haven't,

561
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,110
if you haven't an experience,

562
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:36,831
you've had an experience.

563
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:37,664
There's no way around it.

564
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,870
If you have an experience,

565
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,380
you have to accept that the experience
happened and you have to tell the truth

566
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:44,000
about the experience one way or the other.

567
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:44,241
Right.

568
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:47,510
So for me to not talk about the,

569
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:48,050
you know,

570
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,270
that part of my life or
to pretend that I wasn't,

571
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:55,130
I had a conversion experience
where I was in this temple on,

572
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:55,964
um,

573
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,133
John Maass to meet,

574
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:57,680
which is,

575
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:57,950
uh,

576
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:58,420
the,

577
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:58,730
uh,

578
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,950
they call the appearance date of Krishna.

579
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,570
It's like Christmas basically.

580
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,703
And

581
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,980
what I was,

582
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,250
what did just happen before that is I,

583
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:12,350
someone had gotten me really high,

584
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:13,630
like really stunned.

585
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,590
So I was sitting in the,

586
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:20,120
in the temple and they're like ringing
bells and they have these like deities

587
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:22,640
that they were shipped
and they're pouring this,

588
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:23,450
uh,

589
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:23,841
uh,

590
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:27,110
I believe they pour like milk on the
deities and it's like there's this,

591
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,720
it's all your senses are being uh,

592
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:30,530
overwhelmed.

593
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,660
They're burning incense,

594
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,400
they've got like the flowers everywhere.

595
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:36,410
So the whole place just
garlands of flowers.

596
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:40,670
So it's just the smell of
flowers and incense and monks,

597
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,271
you know,

598
00:16:41,271 --> 00:16:46,271
like the guys with shaved heads and then
necklaces that they wear and like bells

599
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:46,761
ringing.

600
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:48,830
So your senses are completely overcome.

601
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,760
And I've never had this
experience before or since,

602
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,120
but I was looking at these symbols
and all of a sudden assembles.

603
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:03,290
It felt like I was seeing past the symbols
into something deeper than what those

604
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:03,771
symbols were.

605
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:08,771
The symbols were just a human's attempt
to try to embody this greater thing that

606
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:11,570
exists in the universe.

607
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:16,310
And all of a sudden I felt the only way
I can explain it is it felt like I was

608
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,690
sound so crazy.

609
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,310
It felt like I was on a spaceship.

610
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,090
I thought,

611
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:20,301
oh,

612
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:21,200
this is like an advance.

613
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:23,510
This is what an advanced
intelligence is like this.

614
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,720
It felt like I was looking at something
that was a billion times smarter than I

615
00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:29,391
was,

616
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:34,391
and that it was being somehow tuned
into and this ritual that if you were

617
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,240
outside the ritual or just look like
a lot of pomp and maybe some brainwash

618
00:17:40,371 --> 00:17:41,204
people,

619
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:41,750
uh,

620
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,141
you know,

621
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:43,730
going through the motions of something.

622
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,290
But in the inside of it,

623
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:50,220
it felt like this incredible
blast of super intelligence.

624
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,070
And that happened to me and I like it.

625
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,270
It changed me for mine,

626
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,170
for the rest of my life.

627
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:56,310
I'll be changed because of that.

628
00:17:56,311 --> 00:17:57,780
Like I'll never be the same after that.

629
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,980
What do you think it was?

630
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:03,540
Do you think it was a
combination of anxiety?

631
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,630
Because all these people are there
and do what you said you were.

632
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:07,410
Hi.

633
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,190
Yes.

634
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,023
What were you high on?

635
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,980
Marijuana g eat it or smoking it?

636
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,083
Smoked it.

637
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,000
What do you think it was?

638
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:15,571
What do you mean?

639
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:17,250
What do you attribute this?

640
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:17,581
I mean,

641
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:19,290
that's a pretty crazy
experience you're talking about.

642
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,221
Well,

643
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:21,510
I mean what I think that,

644
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:21,811
uh,

645
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:23,740
what it was the chance.

646
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:24,270
Yeah,

647
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,103
it's the chant.

648
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:25,861
I mean,

649
00:18:25,861 --> 00:18:26,610
if you chant Hari,

650
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,610
the thing about Hari Krishna is you don't
have to be a Om Hari Krishna to Chant

651
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:32,790
Hari Krishna.

652
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,210
And that's,

653
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,050
that's the thing that they always said a,

654
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,030
the thing that,

655
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:36,880
uh,

656
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,290
uh,

657
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:37,900
prob apart,

658
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,840
the founder of the art Christian
has said is just Janet,

659
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,070
you have nothing to lose.

660
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,461
Chanted.

661
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:42,900
What the fuck does it do you?

662
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:47,180
You're saying this specific sin
synchronized series of sounds,

663
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,090
this chant,

664
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:48,450
how's,

665
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,600
has an effect that actually
puts you in a psychedelic state?

666
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,351
Oh yeah,

667
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:52,921
absolutely.

668
00:18:52,921 --> 00:18:53,460
That's why I was like,

669
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,840
that's why all the hippies loved it,

670
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:55,081
man.

671
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:55,914
I mean,

672
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,101
yeah,

673
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:56,521
totally.

674
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:56,701
You,

675
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:57,534
it's,

676
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:57,840
Oh,

677
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,470
think of yoga.

678
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,340
Yoga is a,

679
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,353
um,

680
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,000
you know,

681
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,990
specific movements that you do
that if you do these movements,

682
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:05,430
you go into like what you said,

683
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:06,930
this mild psychedelic state.

684
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:11,790
Well that's just one form of Hatha Yoga
or whatever particular type of yoga you

685
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:12,600
are doing.

686
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,830
But in the same way the,

687
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,720
these mantras that they have,

688
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,813
um,

689
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,900
induce a very specific experience that,

690
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,040
um,

691
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,780
if you do it enough,

692
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,710
you will,

693
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:26,260
it'll light.

694
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,950
The only way to explain it is it will,

695
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,730
your mood will lighten.

696
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,811
You will,

697
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:31,620
um,

698
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,280
the heavy,

699
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,551
you know,

700
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:33,660
that heaviness man.

701
00:19:33,661 --> 00:19:34,021
I mean,

702
00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:34,320
I,

703
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,700
there's a heaviness that people get that
I get and if I'm deeply in this state

704
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:39,810
that it's what I consider,

705
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,160
like the road rage state,

706
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,001
you know what I mean?

707
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:43,560
Where I'm likely to scream in a car,

708
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:44,760
cutting me off or something.

709
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:45,390
Like,

710
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,230
if you chant Hari Krishna
or any of the other,

711
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:50,310
there's a lot of other mantras out there,

712
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,181
uh,

713
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:51,540
then,

714
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,610
and you do it regularly just for a week,

715
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,790
then you will experience a
change in your consciousness.

716
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,570
Um,

717
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,490
early all isn't,

718
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,640
how are you attributing that mean?

719
00:19:59,641 --> 00:19:59,871
What,

720
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,330
what,

721
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:00,571
what,

722
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:02,100
what could possibly be?

723
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:02,340
I mean,

724
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,730
from a scientific standpoint,

725
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,200
see,

726
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,370
let's look at the scientific,

727
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:05,671
let's look,

728
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,600
go to scientists might say,

729
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:07,650
I think as scientists would say,

730
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:07,831
well,

731
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,090
it's a placebo effect.

732
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:09,331
You know,

733
00:20:09,331 --> 00:20:10,140
you can,

734
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,970
you could decide to chant any mantra.

735
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:13,080
You can make anything up.

736
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:17,700
You could chant around Ddo Ddo Ddo if you
want it to and do that enough times if

737
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:18,950
you believe it,

738
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,090
it's going to be the
intention creates the change.

739
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,930
That's the,

740
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,750
that would be the scientific
explanation of it.

741
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:25,410
At the,

742
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,243
um,

743
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,210
the religious explanation of it is
that what you're doing is create your,

744
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:33,000
tuning yourself in to a specific,

745
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:37,440
you're tuning your neurology and when
you're chanting your addressing the

746
00:20:37,441 --> 00:20:39,510
language center of your brain,

747
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,540
you're focusing in on
the specific pattern,

748
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,620
how they Krishnamurti Krishna,

749
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:43,981
Krishna,

750
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:44,311
Krishna,

751
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:44,491
Yada,

752
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:44,701
Yada,

753
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,120
Yada at all.

754
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,571
Not at all.

755
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:45,980
My Rama,

756
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,261
Rama,

757
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:48,280
Hada Yachty and you do it
a certain way to do it.

758
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:48,790
How you do it,

759
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,620
how they Krishna,

760
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,430
Hari Krishna,

761
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:50,780
Krishna,

762
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,730
Krishna Yada Yada Yada.

763
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:53,110
You would do it if this is how I channel,

764
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,910
if I'm alone by myself and chanting,

765
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,631
I chant fast.

766
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,260
So it's like how do you son Niggas Niggas,

767
00:20:57,261 --> 00:20:57,530
Niggas,

768
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,160
niggers [inaudible] goes down,

769
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,013
it goes down.

770
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:05,350
Well what Brahm does it talked about
this and said that it's like kind of the

771
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:05,651
way you,

772
00:21:05,651 --> 00:21:07,180
Chan is just an indication of the,

773
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:07,690
where you,

774
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,010
where you are in life.

775
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,031
You know like,

776
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:11,710
so if I'm more relaxed,

777
00:21:11,711 --> 00:21:12,850
the Channing will slow down.

778
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:13,990
But because of,

779
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,853
because of like,

780
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,360
because it's just the way I am.

781
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,480
Like I ended up changing fast
and I'll try to slow myself down,

782
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,340
but it just ends up going fast again.

783
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:22,174
But if you look at,

784
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,250
I mean I just was watching a video
of private by chanting and he chants

785
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:28,300
relatively fast so it
creates a sound like here,

786
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:29,160
listen Hoodie.

787
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,910
It creates this weird trippy sound,

788
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:31,661
especially when you're,

789
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:34,570
if you're do like for real intentions,

790
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,141
how'd he get shot?

791
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:36,160
He goes to negotiate negotiation.

792
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,060
I gotta get it on it.

793
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,740
On my momma.

794
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,390
You gotta get a good shot.

795
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,223
Niggas Niggas

796
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,750
[inaudible]

797
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:41,440
when I got to get it,

798
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,160
Christianity goes Nigga,

799
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,600
this Nigga,

800
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,433
I got it.

801
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,710
[inaudible] I'm Ron,

802
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:44,970
Ron

803
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,870
[inaudible] Niggas niggas zoning.

804
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,450
Let me get [inaudible]
Niggas Niggas only got it.

805
00:21:50,451 --> 00:21:50,890
Yeah.

806
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:51,030
Yeah.

807
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,863
Put It on Monday.

808
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,483
[inaudible]

809
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,570
that's easily the weirdest.

810
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:55,404
She only

811
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,230
plus that out like that.

812
00:21:58,231 --> 00:21:58,920
That's awesome.

813
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,753
That's the chat now.

814
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,830
But what's cool about it is you,

815
00:22:00,831 --> 00:22:01,710
if you listen to the chant,

816
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:02,640
it has the own minute.

817
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,310
How'd he goes?

818
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,320
Yo Niggas Niggas niggas not.

819
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,220
I got to get it home.

820
00:22:05,221 --> 00:22:05,761
Rum,

821
00:22:05,761 --> 00:22:10,590
rum and some people will just chant the
arm or some people will just chat rom.

822
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,700
That's another chant.

823
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:11,940
Okay.

824
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,140
Rom Rom,

825
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:13,771
rum,

826
00:22:13,771 --> 00:22:14,371
rum,

827
00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:14,941
rum,

828
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:15,511
rum,

829
00:22:15,511 --> 00:22:16,140
rum,

830
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,190
all of these are,

831
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,570
no matter what you think.

832
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:20,700
And I know people are
gonna think I'm an a,

833
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,151
you know,

834
00:22:21,151 --> 00:22:22,680
a new age freak or whatever.

835
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:23,370
Um,

836
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,203
but I'm not,

837
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,320
I'm just telling the truth.

838
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,570
It's helped me immensely in my life.

839
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,230
I don't think anyone should do anything
more than like what they're comfortable

840
00:22:31,231 --> 00:22:31,351
with.

841
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:33,240
But if you're having a bad trip,

842
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,360
if you're freaking out
in your life and your,

843
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,201
but if you,

844
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:41,040
especially if you're having a shitty
trip and you start chanting Hari Krishna,

845
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,430
you will feel better in every time.

846
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:44,760
Man.

847
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,680
If you could remember how it goes,

848
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:51,030
blitzkrieg daddy or a man talking to
the lucky charms guy at the top of the

849
00:22:51,031 --> 00:22:51,864
world.

850
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,600
I'm not going to remember that.

851
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:53,811
Chris.

852
00:22:53,811 --> 00:22:54,001
Dan,

853
00:22:54,001 --> 00:22:57,870
could you that it goes down
when a woman just do the home?

854
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:58,071
Well,

855
00:22:58,071 --> 00:22:59,650
I get super banked and getting the tank.

856
00:22:59,670 --> 00:22:59,880
I,

857
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,100
I,

858
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,933
um,

859
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:01,430
yeah,

860
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:01,941
cause you've,

861
00:23:01,941 --> 00:23:03,020
when you're in the tank,

862
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:03,441
you know,

863
00:23:03,441 --> 00:23:03,981
first of all,

864
00:23:03,981 --> 00:23:04,461
it's a,

865
00:23:04,461 --> 00:23:05,500
mine is very tall.

866
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:09,160
It's like seven feet tall and there's
a sound when your ears are underwater.

867
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,370
That's really bizarre,

868
00:23:10,371 --> 00:23:10,910
man.

869
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,190
When you make a body knows like,

870
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:12,910
oh,

871
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,170
oh,

872
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,400
oh

873
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,210
[inaudible]

874
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,351
that'll be my,

875
00:23:21,351 --> 00:23:22,310
all my breath.

876
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,830
Every breath is just that home.

877
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,910
And it's echoing.

878
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,120
So as I'm taking in my inhaler,

879
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:29,660
I'm still hearing the exhale,

880
00:23:29,661 --> 00:23:33,050
echo and then home and I can I get,

881
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,370
I get deep.

882
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,160
Yeah.

883
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,990
I go deep into crazy train town,

884
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,920
crazy train woods,

885
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,920
the woods of the universe.

886
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:41,640
He wa well,

887
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,241
that's the I,

888
00:23:42,241 --> 00:23:46,100
that sound is considered the original
sound vibration of the universe.

889
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:48,020
That's the sound that
all things emerge from.

890
00:23:48,021 --> 00:23:50,050
That's like the basic primordial sound.

891
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,643
Oh boy.

892
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,950
It was a big bang that you went home.

893
00:23:57,951 --> 00:24:00,230
Or when Bob fucking boom.

894
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,020
Oh,

895
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,630
what a shitty theory that is.

896
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,760
The Big Bang is the shittiest theory ever.

897
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:08,950
And I'm not a scientist and I'm clearly,

898
00:24:08,951 --> 00:24:09,784
I'm retarded,

899
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:10,240
but,

900
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,530
and I know that there's some evidence,

901
00:24:11,531 --> 00:24:14,350
supposedly that some big explosion
happened 14 billion years,

902
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:19,560
but th th th they have no
idea why everything was
smaller than the head of a pin

903
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,210
letting you talk.

904
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,940
Yeah.

905
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,721
And so wait a minute.

906
00:24:23,721 --> 00:24:24,110
We do with it.

907
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,550
Everything was smaller
than the head of the,

908
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:27,050
but why was it swollen that we don't know?

909
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,913
We don't know.

910
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,820
But we do believe that there was an
infant point where the whole universal is

911
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,880
smaller than the head of a pin.

912
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,960
They don't even know why.

913
00:24:33,961 --> 00:24:36,480
It's the weirdest fucking
conversation ever.

914
00:24:36,481 --> 00:24:38,670
This is like someone said it best.

915
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,990
It might have been Mckenna,

916
00:24:39,991 --> 00:24:41,280
I think Terence Mckenna said,

917
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:41,850
um,

918
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:46,850
it's as if they're asking you
just believe in magic only once.

919
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,563
Right?

920
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:52,603
Magic.

921
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,180
They,

922
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:54,780
um,

923
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,500
they've read recently figured out a
way to get subatomic particles to move

924
00:24:58,501 --> 00:24:59,334
faster and light.

925
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,770
So that's what they believe
they've accomplished now.

926
00:25:01,771 --> 00:25:02,410
So that,

927
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:06,330
it was just really a week ago the
scientists were saying time travel is

928
00:25:06,331 --> 00:25:09,270
impossible because the speed
of light cannot be surpassed.

929
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,670
And then like a couple of weeks later,

930
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,910
these guys say they got
subatomic particles to move
faster and like time travel

931
00:25:14,911 --> 00:25:15,510
was open again.

932
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,620
So that's the implication.

933
00:25:16,621 --> 00:25:17,030
Yeah,

934
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,550
time travel was the big implication
because once they figured out how to an

935
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:20,384
actually mean,

936
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,470
it would require an
immense amount of power.

937
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:27,471
But just thinking about what powers your
cell phone today and what was like to

938
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:28,350
have those,

939
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:28,561
you know,

940
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:33,030
Apollo 11 computers when they filled an
entire rooms and they weren't nearly as

941
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,850
powerful as your cell
phone and your cell phone,

942
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,470
not even plugged in anything.

943
00:25:37,471 --> 00:25:38,750
It's in your fucking pocket.

944
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,310
Can you explain what that,

945
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,303
I know they,

946
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,300
maybe you can cause I don't understand it.

947
00:25:43,301 --> 00:25:43,401
I,

948
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:46,210
I they will blast it to
neutrinos or something.

949
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:50,350
And then it trinos where they reached
where there were supposed to reach a few

950
00:25:50,351 --> 00:25:53,380
milliseconds before they should
have reached it or something.

951
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,400
That's a huge question.

952
00:25:54,401 --> 00:25:54,791
So let's,

953
00:25:54,791 --> 00:25:57,940
let's look it up on Google because
I'm not the person answers.

954
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,280
And also I don't think they've
totally confirmed it yet.

955
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:04,090
I think a lot of people are still saying
that there's a high likelihood for some

956
00:26:04,091 --> 00:26:07,300
kind of error and they experiment a
course and while everybody's going to say

957
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:08,950
that anyone when something that crazy,

958
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,720
you know when someone says,

959
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,770
oh I figured out the time traveling bitch,

960
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,380
figure out how can we see your papers.

961
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,320
He didn't feel at that
time she was a bitch.

962
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:16,691
Yeah.

963
00:26:16,691 --> 00:26:18,070
I was thinking about time travel.

964
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:22,990
If there really was a time traveler then
they could follow somebody by walking

965
00:26:22,991 --> 00:26:23,824
in front of them.

966
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,383
Wow.

967
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:26,750
That's a,

968
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,583
yeah,

969
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,610
cause you would know where they were going
already so you could walk in front of

970
00:26:30,611 --> 00:26:31,600
them on whatever.

971
00:26:31,601 --> 00:26:35,070
We would have to have like a really
fucking detailed list of all the shifts

972
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:36,010
that's already gone down.

973
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,820
You have to see it,

974
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,360
you'd have to send a time pro back
first to like watch and watch the whole

975
00:26:40,361 --> 00:26:40,930
world.

976
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,530
Observe whoever you want it
to run out of time would die.

977
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,540
You die of old age.

978
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:44,820
No.

979
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,653
If you want it,

980
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,790
you could send,

981
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,291
you could like,

982
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:49,441
it's,

983
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:49,651
you know,

984
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:51,990
if you wanted to observe like
Thomas Jefferson or something.

985
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,010
Right.

986
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:53,371
What'd you be?

987
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:54,210
Incredible.

988
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:54,751
Yeah.

989
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:55,110
Right.

990
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,450
To get real videos of
the founding fathers.

991
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,030
Who would you go to if you had,

992
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,610
if you had a just an
open ticket back in time?

993
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,900
Clearly the first person I visited,

994
00:27:04,901 --> 00:27:05,740
his Jesus,

995
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,250
no,

996
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,083
hold on.

997
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,070
Jesus or Buddha or Jesus or Buddha.

998
00:27:10,071 --> 00:27:11,330
That's a tough choice.

999
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:11,991
I think.

1000
00:27:11,991 --> 00:27:12,131
I,

1001
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:12,380
I,

1002
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,500
I know the first human,

1003
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:16,970
I want to visit the first human,

1004
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,780
I guess

1005
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,420
the first human you'd want
to see cave men on the field.

1006
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:20,891
Yeah.

1007
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:21,490
I think that if,

1008
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,290
I mean if I had to have
a bunch of chances,

1009
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:23,331
I,

1010
00:27:23,331 --> 00:27:24,880
that's the first thing I'd like to see.

1011
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,560
Then I move up to Buddha

1012
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:28,221
and then,

1013
00:27:28,221 --> 00:27:29,054
Uhm,

1014
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,953
I dunno.

1015
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:30,441
All right,

1016
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:30,890
here's the,

1017
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:31,723
here's what it is.

1018
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,050
The research clearly shows that when a
total of 15,000 beams of neutrinos were

1019
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:36,830
fired,

1020
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,270
the tiny particles traveled,

1021
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,760
the 730 kilometer,

1022
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,090
2.43 millisecond trip,

1023
00:27:44,091 --> 00:27:46,910
roughly 60 nano seconds faster than light.

1024
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:48,943
Wow.

1025
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,091
That's fascinating.

1026
00:27:50,091 --> 00:27:50,780
Because that,

1027
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,111
that's,

1028
00:27:51,111 --> 00:27:51,944
that's just,

1029
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,813
that's period.

1030
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,700
That's not,

1031
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,940
they think so.

1032
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:56,570
That's it.

1033
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:56,711
Yeah.

1034
00:27:56,711 --> 00:27:57,410
That's it.

1035
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:57,920
Yeah.

1036
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,440
By saying that this is Soren
that's putting this out,

1037
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,461
so that's it.

1038
00:28:01,461 --> 00:28:01,630
So,

1039
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:04,080
so they'll know Cerner's folks CRM,

1040
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,581
look it up.

1041
00:28:04,581 --> 00:28:07,880
It's still the people that are
responsible for the large Hadron collider,

1042
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:08,650
which is the,

1043
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:11,870
the craziest scientific experiment
ever that's going on right now.

1044
00:28:11,871 --> 00:28:12,980
I believe it's in Switzerland,

1045
00:28:12,981 --> 00:28:13,350
right?

1046
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:13,540
Yes.

1047
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,010
From Sweden underground.

1048
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,640
Fucking incredible gigantic particle
collider that is supposed to uncover this

1049
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:22,810
thing called the Higgs Boson particle,

1050
00:28:22,811 --> 00:28:23,560
which they call a,

1051
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,180
or excuse me,

1052
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:24,390
most,

1053
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,510
and people have corrected me on that.

1054
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:25,870
Listen,

1055
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,681
my apologies.

1056
00:28:26,681 --> 00:28:28,300
Boson the God particle.

1057
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:28,960
Yeah.

1058
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,290
But now they're saying that it's
95% sure that it doesn't exist.

1059
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:32,980
Yeah.

1060
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,813
Fuck.

1061
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,601
Too Bad.

1062
00:28:34,601 --> 00:28:34,991
You know,

1063
00:28:34,991 --> 00:28:38,260
you imagine that they built this gigantic
fucking billion dollars when they

1064
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,760
obviously finding out
a bunch of other shit.

1065
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,970
I'll take time traveler
or some stupid particle.

1066
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,470
Well who knows what that particle means.

1067
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:47,920
They did create that
cork glue on plasma shit.

1068
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:48,700
That's,

1069
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:53,700
I believe it's one sugar cube was like
400 billion pounds or something fucking

1070
00:28:54,131 --> 00:28:54,964
crazy.

1071
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:55,960
But that's what it was.

1072
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,080
They created some incredibly
negligent will amount,

1073
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,321
you know,

1074
00:28:59,321 --> 00:28:59,861
some tiny,

1075
00:28:59,861 --> 00:29:00,694
small,

1076
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,360
yeah.

1077
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,560
Don't want a lot of that shit.

1078
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:03,394
Lanner right.

1079
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,040
Did you imagine if they made
like a marble sized chocolate?

1080
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,860
It just dropped the earth

1081
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,960
just shot right into the
water and core like water.

1082
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:17,080
The earth would just be
like a big droplet of water.

1083
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:17,710
Oh,

1084
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,160
I wonder how much weight it
would take for that to happen.

1085
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,353
For sure.

1086
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:27,390
If you had a bowling ball full
of this Gwar glue on Yasma Shit.

1087
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:28,480
Yeah.

1088
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,180
That shit would just go right through
the right to the earth of bowling ball

1089
00:29:31,181 --> 00:29:33,040
would have to be some
insane amount of weight.

1090
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:33,731
Yeah,

1091
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:34,564
it would be.

1092
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:34,990
I,

1093
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:35,261
yeah,

1094
00:29:35,261 --> 00:29:36,520
I don't know what the weight would be.

1095
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,420
Someone should,

1096
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,253
I don't know,

1097
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,570
had around something.

1098
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:40,710
There's that dense,

1099
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,390
think like a fat person
and you look at it like,

1100
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,080
think about,

1101
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,620
um,

1102
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:48,820
fat James from the container store or
fat James Lovelock chain is a great guy.

1103
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,310
Calls himself fat James Fox.

1104
00:29:50,311 --> 00:29:50,880
We got off.

1105
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,140
It's,

1106
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:51,973
it's his nickname.

1107
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,490
It's Fred James calls you up.

1108
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:53,651
Hey,

1109
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:54,430
it's Fred James.

1110
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,050
Yup.

1111
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:55,400
Um,

1112
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,970
so you think about him as a human easy,

1113
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,090
not a tall fellow,

1114
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,910
but he's fairly heavy and you look at it,

1115
00:29:59,911 --> 00:30:00,041
we go,

1116
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:00,520
wow,

1117
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:00,851
that's a,

1118
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:02,050
that's a lot of weight right there.

1119
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:02,770
That's wonderful.

1120
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,470
Now think about if he was
a cork glue on plasma,

1121
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:08,651
you know what I'm saying?

1122
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:09,100
I mean,

1123
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,240
even wrap your head around that.

1124
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:10,540
Yeah.

1125
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:15,540
A sugar cube is 40 billion or 400
billion fucking pounds over the hell.

1126
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,060
Yeah.

1127
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,570
Whatever insane mean
when you say 40 billion,

1128
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,271
400 billion.

1129
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:20,270
I know that it's,

1130
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,820
there's a big difference
in those two numbers,

1131
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,630
but to me,

1132
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,770
none of them even register.

1133
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:25,330
I'm just making noises with my mouth.

1134
00:30:25,331 --> 00:30:25,510
I don't know.

1135
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:25,690
Right.

1136
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,670
40 billion means or 400 billion means.

1137
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,661
That to me is like,

1138
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:29,710
it's too abstract.

1139
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:30,544
It's too big.

1140
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,900
I'm not assimilating that.

1141
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:32,770
You know,

1142
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,410
but to think about fat James
made out of this stuff,

1143
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,730
you can't even like,

1144
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,750
how is that even possible that it could
be two types of matter that are both

1145
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:45,751
some the so far different from each other
that they could be the same size and

1146
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,700
one of them would be literally
the weight of the fucking earth.

1147
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,170
Probably not that way.

1148
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:50,621
Yeah.

1149
00:30:50,621 --> 00:30:51,120
It's,

1150
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,250
it's insane to think about that and it's
insane to think that these people are

1151
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:57,340
down there tinkering around under
Switzerland trying to make this shit.

1152
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,230
That's what this is creepy.

1153
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,270
Well they make only a
little tiny amounts of it.

1154
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:01,571
You know,

1155
00:31:01,571 --> 00:31:01,830
they've,

1156
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,090
they're,

1157
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,520
they've got a great
sense of humor about it.

1158
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:03,840
They,

1159
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,600
they dress up like the life dude's
and they've like take pictures of them

1160
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:09,350
pretending to be the
characters and halflife.

1161
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:09,870
Yeah.

1162
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,710
Cause we don't know that the video
game half life was all about scientists

1163
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,540
cracking a hole in the universe
and the aliens come over.

1164
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,374
Fuck everybody up.

1165
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,101
Awesome game.

1166
00:31:18,101 --> 00:31:19,240
What an awesome game that is.

1167
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:19,851
But dude,

1168
00:31:19,851 --> 00:31:21,050
I like to think about,

1169
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:25,580
one thing I like to think of APP is
the large Hadron collider accident.

1170
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,550
Like what it would look like
and like the way I see it,

1171
00:31:28,551 --> 00:31:29,420
it goes like this.

1172
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:29,961
You're,

1173
00:31:29,961 --> 00:31:30,950
you're on the Internet,

1174
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,870
you look on wherever you go,

1175
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,440
CNN and it says fire
large Hadron collider.

1176
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:38,240
That's the first thing
you see and you're like,

1177
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:39,021
God that sucks.

1178
00:31:39,021 --> 00:31:41,300
Now there was an explosion underground.

1179
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,050
That's it.

1180
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:45,770
Then like five minutes later it's like
this fire is spreading like no fire we've

1181
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:46,670
ever seen before.

1182
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:50,090
Like the fires just all of a sudden
just racing through Switzerland.

1183
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,240
No one understands why it's spreading
that fastener and like what the fuck?

1184
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,670
And then the next thing
you think is what's that?

1185
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,740
You're just gone.

1186
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:02,950
Cause this fucking energy beam is shot
around the planet and like a millisecond

1187
00:32:02,961 --> 00:32:04,400
just wiped everything out.

1188
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,390
That's,

1189
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,010
that's how I know I've eaten too much pot.

1190
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,470
Cause inevitably my mind will
start going to the large,

1191
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,071
I'll start getting,

1192
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:12,410
getting nervous about the
large Hadron collider.

1193
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,730
Have you eaten too much pot today?

1194
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,360
No.

1195
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:14,990
You're okay?

1196
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,830
Totally fine.

1197
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,640
Totally fine.

1198
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,780
How much of that Cook you take?

1199
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:18,711
Just a crumb.

1200
00:32:18,711 --> 00:32:19,544
I didn't even open.

1201
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:19,881
Oh yeah,

1202
00:32:19,881 --> 00:32:20,714
I took a crumb.

1203
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,560
Good move.

1204
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:21,801
Yeah,

1205
00:32:21,801 --> 00:32:22,130
I'm not,

1206
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:22,331
I,

1207
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:22,940
I've,

1208
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,740
I've fucked up so many times.

1209
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:25,490
Yeah.

1210
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:25,861
You know,

1211
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,680
I'm 100% for marijuana legalization,

1212
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,400
but I think you should at least have
to read a book or watch a documentary

1213
00:32:32,401 --> 00:32:32,650
before.

1214
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,630
Eat one of those cookies.

1215
00:32:33,631 --> 00:32:34,290
Yes.

1216
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,370
You don't know what the fuck you again,

1217
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,600
I could eat a cookie.

1218
00:32:36,601 --> 00:32:37,740
It's just a cookie.

1219
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:38,970
It's no big deal.

1220
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,100
I'm going to eat the whole

1221
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,840
cookie.

1222
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,550
Those cookies are crippling sometimes.

1223
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,181
Sometimes.

1224
00:32:44,181 --> 00:32:44,871
Cause you don't know what,

1225
00:32:44,871 --> 00:32:45,560
how many,

1226
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,970
there's no standard dose.

1227
00:32:46,971 --> 00:32:48,800
Like when you get a
cookie and it says two x,

1228
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,150
what the fuck does that mean?

1229
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:50,751
You know,

1230
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:51,561
two doses.

1231
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:53,810
Two doses for who to x is three x is,

1232
00:32:53,811 --> 00:32:54,860
I don't know what this fucking,

1233
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,320
you're using a porn system for this shit.

1234
00:32:57,321 --> 00:32:59,240
You're using the porn rating system.

1235
00:32:59,690 --> 00:32:59,931
Dude,

1236
00:32:59,931 --> 00:33:00,764
I had a one,

1237
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,560
a one bite of a very small cookie.

1238
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:05,770
This cookie was only like the size of us.

1239
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:08,510
Not even just slightly
larger than a quarter.

1240
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:08,860
Yeah,

1241
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,800
it was a small cookie.

1242
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,420
I took a little bite out of it.

1243
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:11,901
I said,

1244
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:12,920
let's just be careful.

1245
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:14,180
I'll take a little bite out of it.

1246
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,920
An hour later,

1247
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:16,671
I literally,

1248
00:33:16,671 --> 00:33:18,800
my whole body was tangling.

1249
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,490
I want to just lie down on the
carpet and make like carpet angels.

1250
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,400
I was lit screen.

1251
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,860
I mean roaring,

1252
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:33,220
roaring through the tunnels of reality
clinging to the earth as it spins a

1253
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:34,340
thousand miles an hour.

1254
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,173
I was,

1255
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,040
all I could think of is what the fuck
would happen if I took that whole cookie.

1256
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,390
I couldn't even keep my eyes.

1257
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,200
What would happen?

1258
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,801
I was like this.

1259
00:33:42,801 --> 00:33:43,341
I was just sitting.

1260
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:47,030
I was like cuddling with
myself on the couch.

1261
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,740
I was blasted.

1262
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,521
Meanwhile,

1263
00:33:49,521 --> 00:33:50,960
the phone rang and I picked up the phone.

1264
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,800
Hello.

1265
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,740
I was talking to a buddy line.

1266
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:52,850
Yo,

1267
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:53,480
what's up dude?

1268
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:53,661
No,

1269
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:54,494
everything's cool,

1270
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:54,960
right?

1271
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,793
Yeah,

1272
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,271
no,

1273
00:33:56,271 --> 00:33:56,691
I'm just,

1274
00:33:56,691 --> 00:33:58,100
I'm getting some writing done.

1275
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:58,731
All right man.

1276
00:33:58,731 --> 00:33:59,570
I'll talk to you a bye.

1277
00:33:59,571 --> 00:33:59,870
Click.

1278
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,520
Oh right back into it.

1279
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,090
I could talk on the phone like I,

1280
00:34:03,091 --> 00:34:03,770
I could,

1281
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:04,371
I could be okay.

1282
00:34:04,371 --> 00:34:05,204
I was functioning.

1283
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:05,750
Yeah,

1284
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,471
but I was thinking,

1285
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:08,510
what if I took that whole fucking cookie?

1286
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:08,770
Okay.

1287
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:09,490
Yeah.

1288
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:10,211
That's funny though.

1289
00:34:10,211 --> 00:34:12,550
That thing you just said about
how that part of your mind,

1290
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:17,170
the part of your mind that like clicks
back into know like no matter how deep

1291
00:34:17,171 --> 00:34:20,770
the psychedelic experiences there is a
party puts a flashlight in your eyes.

1292
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,410
Yeah.

1293
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:21,881
Like dude,

1294
00:34:21,881 --> 00:34:22,714
we're cool.

1295
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,063
Everything's fine.

1296
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:24,701
Yeah.

1297
00:34:24,701 --> 00:34:28,010
It's very strange how your mind can
do that no matter how far out you get.

1298
00:34:28,011 --> 00:34:28,840
It's very,

1299
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,190
it's a,

1300
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,400
it's a curiosity.

1301
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,840
Like there's a story about the ROM DASS
talks about this lady car them cause she

1302
00:34:34,841 --> 00:34:36,490
was on orange sunshine,

1303
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:40,570
which was apparently back in the
60s it was like the ultimate LSD.

1304
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,420
It was like this legendary acid.

1305
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,720
And she called him and said,

1306
00:34:46,721 --> 00:34:47,554
you know I've,

1307
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:48,460
I've,

1308
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,210
you know I've gone,

1309
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,620
I've took too much orange sunshine.

1310
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,180
I'm going completely insane.

1311
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,620
I don't know what to do.

1312
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,693
And he's like,

1313
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,360
okay well can you put the person on who
thought that they should call me and

1314
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:04,210
pick up the phone and dialed it cause
that's who I want to talk to you right

1315
00:35:04,211 --> 00:35:04,780
now.

1316
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,800
Cause it's like her,

1317
00:35:05,801 --> 00:35:09,250
she was a logical enough to not
to dial a phone and call and talk.

1318
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,110
She was making logical decisions.

1319
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:15,640
She had just decided to allow herself
to be the crazy person for a second.

1320
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,271
You know,

1321
00:35:16,271 --> 00:35:16,900
there's always,

1322
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,410
that's,

1323
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:21,160
that's what I'm saying is it's
like there's always the observer.

1324
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:25,630
There's always the part of yourself that's
watching you go into whatever or the

1325
00:35:25,631 --> 00:35:27,400
experiences that you're going into,

1326
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:30,160
whether it's a psychedelic experience,

1327
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,110
whether it's a traumatic life experience,

1328
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,510
there's always the part of you
that's just kind of watching.

1329
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,060
It just depends on who you want
to identify with it at any given,

1330
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,161
you know,

1331
00:35:38,161 --> 00:35:38,461
so,

1332
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:39,181
so you know,

1333
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:40,014
when you get angry,

1334
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,390
easier said than done though.

1335
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:43,580
When you're talking about
someone going on a bad trip.

1336
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,560
Because when you go on a bad trip,

1337
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:47,540
you could feel utterly helpless.

1338
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,140
Right.

1339
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,200
The crazy thing about
psychedelics is that you have to,

1340
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,090
you have to release yourself to them.

1341
00:35:53,091 --> 00:35:56,000
You must submit in order to take
in the experience correctly,

1342
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,630
you've got to submit or you got to
take doses where you have no choice.

1343
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,280
Yes.

1344
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:00,531
You know,

1345
00:36:00,531 --> 00:36:01,100
and those are,

1346
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:01,933
that's better.

1347
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:09,540
I know you said that was awesome,

1348
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:10,271
but yeah,

1349
00:36:10,271 --> 00:36:10,460
no,

1350
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,860
it is you that was as honest
as you could have been.

1351
00:36:12,861 --> 00:36:13,490
Yes.

1352
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:17,180
That's a better thing because when you
have to surrender that involves like this

1353
00:36:17,181 --> 00:36:18,140
choice to die,

1354
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,190
it's like it's still,

1355
00:36:19,191 --> 00:36:22,190
the bad trips occur and the reason why
the bad trips occurs because you're

1356
00:36:22,191 --> 00:36:22,611
fighting it,

1357
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:23,310
right?

1358
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:23,690
Yeah.

1359
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:23,961
Well,

1360
00:36:23,961 --> 00:36:24,230
yeah.

1361
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:27,040
I mean there are bad trips can occur
for a lot of different reasons.

1362
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:27,140
I,

1363
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:27,410
yeah.

1364
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,210
It's quite often it's ego death.

1365
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:32,990
You're desperately trying to keep
yourself from blinking out of existence.

1366
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:33,411
Yeah.

1367
00:36:33,411 --> 00:36:33,980
You've,

1368
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:38,060
your ego kicks in and does the exact
same thing that happens when someone's

1369
00:36:38,061 --> 00:36:38,770
dying.

1370
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:38,950
Okay.

1371
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,783
I used to,

1372
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,570
it makes sense to you then that you know,

1373
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,570
you would be feeling like you're
going crazy and to be terrified.

1374
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,410
Oh no,

1375
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,070
sure.

1376
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:47,760
Isn't it the,

1377
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,510
isn't the real problem that there's no
one to guide people on these experiences?

1378
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:51,751
No.

1379
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:56,751
Like really seasoned professionals that
measure the dose in a clinical setting

1380
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:58,561
and like,

1381
00:36:58,561 --> 00:36:59,160
you know,

1382
00:36:59,160 --> 00:36:59,820
like,

1383
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:04,680
could you imagine how much help
people could get from that sort of an

1384
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:05,380
environment?

1385
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:05,681
Dude,

1386
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:06,610
you've helped me.

1387
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,300
I've talked to you on the phone when I'm
way too high and you've inevitably made

1388
00:37:10,301 --> 00:37:12,040
me feel better just from
like talking to you,

1389
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:14,860
cause I'll call it out
if I'm freaking out.

1390
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,780
I don't remember the specific time,

1391
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:22,020
but I know that I've called you and
just started talking about some terrible

1392
00:37:22,391 --> 00:37:24,990
idea I'd have about an imminent war.

1393
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,950
Something like some awful thing.

1394
00:37:26,951 --> 00:37:29,380
I'm getting paranoid about it and
you're really good at being like,

1395
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,550
that's not going to happen.

1396
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,440
You're fine that everything's fine.

1397
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,100
And it just takes that it's just
one confident person and be like,

1398
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:36,491
dude,

1399
00:37:36,491 --> 00:37:37,720
everything's going to be really great.

1400
00:37:37,721 --> 00:37:40,030
You don't have to worry about
anything and you'll feel better.

1401
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:40,781
So yeah,

1402
00:37:40,781 --> 00:37:41,141
you're right.

1403
00:37:41,141 --> 00:37:42,430
There needs to be these people.

1404
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,530
Especially that's not right.

1405
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:43,780
Not even

1406
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,270
someone you know who
knows what they're doing.

1407
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,270
That's just a friend you just
called up a friend and seem normal.

1408
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,690
But if you were getting
dosed up by a professional,

1409
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,381
you know what I'm saying?

1410
00:37:53,381 --> 00:37:54,190
Because I think,

1411
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:54,401
look,

1412
00:37:54,401 --> 00:37:54,881
like I said,

1413
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:56,800
I do think that everything
should be legal.

1414
00:37:56,801 --> 00:37:57,041
I mean,

1415
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:01,210
I think there's horrible consequences
to make crack and heroin illegal.

1416
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:02,800
And if you want to keep those illegal,

1417
00:38:02,801 --> 00:38:03,160
um,

1418
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,491
you know,

1419
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:04,360
I'm not gonna fight you.

1420
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,620
I'm not going to fight your own math.

1421
00:38:05,621 --> 00:38:06,310
I'm not going to find,

1422
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,560
I don't think it should
be easy to get math.

1423
00:38:08,561 --> 00:38:10,570
And I think the people make math for sure.

1424
00:38:10,571 --> 00:38:12,070
You should fucking put them in a cage.

1425
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:12,360
Yeah.

1426
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:12,580
You know,

1427
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,331
some asshole.

1428
00:38:13,331 --> 00:38:13,511
What's,

1429
00:38:13,511 --> 00:38:14,380
it gives someone addictive,

1430
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:18,490
some horrible fucking chemical that's
from cold syrup and shit and it just

1431
00:38:18,491 --> 00:38:20,320
completely fucks your world up.

1432
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,420
But when it comes to other stuff,

1433
00:38:22,421 --> 00:38:27,421
when it comes to like mushrooms
or Iowasca or all these,

1434
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,870
these things have to be
released to the public.

1435
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,800
Totally.

1436
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,633
They have to,

1437
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,530
if they don't get released to public,

1438
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,030
society suffers.

1439
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,370
Society is more lost.

1440
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,230
Society is a less
introspective is more plumper.

1441
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,480
Prone to patterns.

1442
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:44,141
Yeah.

1443
00:38:44,141 --> 00:38:45,640
It's like closing the library.

1444
00:38:45,641 --> 00:38:46,650
It's a type of library.

1445
00:38:46,651 --> 00:38:49,180
You're not like letting people
into not just a library,

1446
00:38:49,181 --> 00:38:50,160
but perhaps a,

1447
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,380
a source of inspiration,

1448
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:54,161
of knowledge,

1449
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:54,761
of wisdom.

1450
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:56,740
It might even be another
fucking life form.

1451
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,101
You know,

1452
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:57,491
so many,

1453
00:38:57,491 --> 00:38:57,850
um,

1454
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:58,210
uh,

1455
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,370
corrected me on Twitter the
other day about something,

1456
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,700
but we were talking about mushrooms
being plants and it was like actually

1457
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,140
mushrooms,

1458
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:04,781
not a plan.

1459
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:05,501
It's a fungus.

1460
00:39:05,501 --> 00:39:06,730
It's a totally different lights.

1461
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,593
Life source,

1462
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,171
isn't it?

1463
00:39:08,171 --> 00:39:08,951
Its own kingdom.

1464
00:39:08,951 --> 00:39:09,910
It's its own kingdom.

1465
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,140
And not only that,

1466
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:11,281
they're,

1467
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:13,510
they're closer to animals
than they are to plants.

1468
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,340
And you know,

1469
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:15,971
when,

1470
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:19,390
when you talk about a
giant super organisms,

1471
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:21,610
the whole Pacific northwest,

1472
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:26,850
apparently there's some giant mushroom
colony and the Pacific northwest,

1473
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:27,940
it's all considered,

1474
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:28,290
you know,

1475
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:28,931
it's under the,

1476
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:33,100
it's mycelium or whatever the fuck it is
considered one large organism and it's

1477
00:39:33,101 --> 00:39:34,530
one of the biggest organisms on the,

1478
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,500
on the planet.

1479
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,980
It's like a fucking
sperm whale of mushrooms.

1480
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,480
I think it's bigger than a sperm.

1481
00:39:40,481 --> 00:39:40,721
I mean,

1482
00:39:40,721 --> 00:39:42,160
I think it's you like,

1483
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:42,611
it's like,

1484
00:39:42,611 --> 00:39:44,170
isn't that miles or something?

1485
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,550
Something crazy like that.

1486
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:47,440
But it is a life form.

1487
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,920
And Mckenna had this rap
about mushrooms that,

1488
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:51,520
um,

1489
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,170
not only did he think that mushrooms were
the catalysts for humans evolving from

1490
00:39:56,171 --> 00:39:57,160
lower primates,

1491
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:01,510
but he also thought that mushrooms
came from of their planet because the,

1492
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:06,730
because the fact that spores could survive
in a vacuum and it's structure of a,

1493
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,200
of a,

1494
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:08,621
what is it,

1495
00:40:08,621 --> 00:40:09,880
five p there's a,

1496
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:14,140
it's called a Fox for a [inaudible] and
dimethyl trip and he said something like

1497
00:40:14,141 --> 00:40:17,170
something about that
phosphorous or positions,

1498
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,880
the only one like it on the planet.

1499
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,220
There's nothing like that
mushroom and the planet.

1500
00:40:21,221 --> 00:40:23,410
And yet it mimics human neuro chemistry.

1501
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,583
I mean,

1502
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:25,300
and,

1503
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,280
and dimethyltryptamine is produced
in the human body and the,

1504
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:31,660
and it's in the blood brain barrier and
they think it's responsible for dreams

1505
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:32,380
and all that shit.

1506
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,360
And this stuff has it in it.

1507
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,620
I mean it is,

1508
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,090
that is part of what it is.

1509
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,460
And if it really did
come from another planet,

1510
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,930
imagine if you know,

1511
00:40:40,931 --> 00:40:45,070
all of our ideas about intelligent
life are based on the above,

1512
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,080
the ability to manipulate carbon,

1513
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,390
to build the ability to
manipulate carbon matter.

1514
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,480
But what if a mushroom is a life form
that has evolved so far that it doesn't

1515
00:40:55,211 --> 00:40:56,530
need a form anymore.

1516
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,940
It doesn't need to move and the way it
gets you as you eat it and you can't kill

1517
00:41:00,941 --> 00:41:01,061
it,

1518
00:41:01,061 --> 00:41:06,061
it fucking fly through
space on an asteroid gets
knocked off of one pat planet

1519
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:10,120
and travels 4 billion light years
to another one and lands there,

1520
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:10,780
you know,

1521
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:14,170
and it starts up a new fucking colony
and mushrooms and they grow and they grow

1522
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,190
where people are.

1523
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,840
They don't grow in the middle of nowhere.

1524
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,770
They're not hard to find.

1525
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,480
They're on grass lawns.

1526
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,610
Lawns were people who always are.

1527
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,170
They're always around people,

1528
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:23,740
man.

1529
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,371
There's people,

1530
00:41:24,371 --> 00:41:25,240
there's mushrooms.

1531
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,560
That's a weird thing.

1532
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,880
That's a weird thing.

1533
00:41:27,881 --> 00:41:31,330
The idea that it's a life form a life
form from another planet that came in on

1534
00:41:31,331 --> 00:41:34,350
an asteroid and that that's
how theory of Panspermia that,

1535
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,650
that that's how life is
seated throughout the unit.

1536
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,513
What's the word?

1537
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,480
Penn spirit.

1538
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:39,403
That's cool.

1539
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:39,710
Yeah.

1540
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:44,710
The idea is that the universe is seeded
by asteroid impacts hitting planets and

1541
00:41:45,321 --> 00:41:46,160
knocking off,

1542
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,030
you know,

1543
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:47,420
um,

1544
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:47,800
uh,

1545
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,410
amino acids and the building blocks
of life and in somehow or another,

1546
00:41:51,411 --> 00:41:55,040
some sort of a chemical reaction with
another plan and also comments carrying

1547
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:57,660
water and the water comes and in life is,

1548
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,130
and it's,

1549
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:58,431
you know,

1550
00:41:58,431 --> 00:42:02,030
and it goes from one planet to the other
and that's the idea is we're seated by

1551
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:02,864
asteroids.

1552
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:03,731
Yeah.

1553
00:42:03,731 --> 00:42:04,030
That,

1554
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:04,863
I mean,

1555
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,430
that idea I've heard,

1556
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,110
I've heard Mccain has idea and it,

1557
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,820
and when you're tripping,

1558
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:14,821
it definitely does seem like you are
getting some kind of transmission from

1559
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,170
something you're getting.

1560
00:42:16,171 --> 00:42:16,290
Right.

1561
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:16,530
Well,

1562
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,450
not even a transmission to me.

1563
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,640
To me when I'm really gone,

1564
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,150
it feels like I'm in
something or I'm a part of it,

1565
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:24,601
you know,

1566
00:42:24,601 --> 00:42:24,811
like,

1567
00:42:24,811 --> 00:42:25,230
um,

1568
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,550
it's not a transmission.

1569
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,180
Um,

1570
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,580
in this amount,

1571
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,010
my,

1572
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:34,010
whatever your consciousness truly
is outside of cells and fingernails,

1573
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,130
whenever your,

1574
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:35,431
your,

1575
00:42:35,431 --> 00:42:36,840
your inner consciousness is,

1576
00:42:36,841 --> 00:42:40,140
this thing took me to another place.

1577
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,890
And so the physical body
that I exist to move around,

1578
00:42:42,891 --> 00:42:45,840
it literally didn't exist and
I was inside this other place.

1579
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,540
It's an experience that's not like,

1580
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,400
it's not like a transmission,

1581
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,180
you know,

1582
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:54,030
it's almost like more like
a chemical gateway feeling.

1583
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:54,661
And you know,

1584
00:42:54,661 --> 00:42:57,400
we talked about this before the podcast
that it could just be your sense is

1585
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,160
fucking with you when
you're whacked out on drugs.

1586
00:42:59,161 --> 00:42:59,994
It big.

1587
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,470
It could be that your senses,

1588
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,110
everybody sends his work the same way.

1589
00:43:03,111 --> 00:43:05,700
You take this whacked out drug and
everybody gets a reaction the same way.

1590
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,380
But I don't think it is.

1591
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,040
Um,

1592
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,120
and even if it is,

1593
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,000
it's more fun to think that it's
not and there's no evidence to prove

1594
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,073
yes,

1595
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,200
facts,

1596
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,900
stick with it because
it's more empowering.

1597
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:16,763
It's more fascinating.

1598
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,140
I like to believe in magic.

1599
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:18,681
You know,

1600
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:20,150
I don't have to believe in too much magic,

1601
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,670
but I like to believe
that mushrooms are magic.

1602
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,590
I like to believe that DMTs magic.

1603
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,120
I like to believe that the wheat is magic.

1604
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:27,201
I really believe we,

1605
00:43:27,201 --> 00:43:28,034
it is magic.

1606
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,300
It sounds stupid,

1607
00:43:29,301 --> 00:43:30,134
but listen,

1608
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:30,420
I'm,

1609
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,390
I'm talking about it in a silly,

1610
00:43:32,391 --> 00:43:33,560
utilitarian way,

1611
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,370
in a way that's functional and easy to
use without delving too deeply into what

1612
00:43:37,371 --> 00:43:38,180
the wheat is.

1613
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,380
When I smoke weed,

1614
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,030
all the sudden I get ideas.

1615
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,530
I smoke weed and it's shit.

1616
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,640
Ooh,

1617
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:44,840
all of a sudden I have ideas.

1618
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:45,770
What is that?

1619
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:46,610
If that's not magic,

1620
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:47,600
I don't know what the fuck is.

1621
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,680
All things come to you from
the burning of a plant.

1622
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:52,761
He burned a plant.

1623
00:43:52,761 --> 00:43:53,720
You take in its essence,

1624
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:55,993
west

1625
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,330
introspective thoughts.

1626
00:43:59,331 --> 00:44:01,190
Start worrying about your own behavior,

1627
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:02,690
studying yourself,

1628
00:44:02,691 --> 00:44:04,190
looking at the world differently,

1629
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:05,024
thinking about,

1630
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:05,923
wow,

1631
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,480
how strange clowns are,

1632
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:07,671
man,

1633
00:44:07,671 --> 00:44:08,840
they're just floating above us.

1634
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:09,890
There's moisture in them,

1635
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:10,900
right?

1636
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:11,721
Where's that coming from?

1637
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:12,300
Mad.

1638
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:12,430
Well,

1639
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:13,151
you're whacked out,

1640
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:13,601
man.

1641
00:44:13,601 --> 00:44:14,770
You killing your brain cells,

1642
00:44:14,771 --> 00:44:15,090
man.

1643
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,810
That's your brain cells done.

1644
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:18,980
That's the first time your
brain cells are dying.

1645
00:44:18,981 --> 00:44:20,620
As you start adding brilliant thoughts,

1646
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:22,870
you remember that and this
is your brain on drugs,

1647
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,450
the the Ag love at any point in time
to get high and debate that Guy,

1648
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:29,410
the Warren drive,

1649
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,920
that commercial guy.

1650
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:33,060
No nonsense guy.

1651
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:33,983
Yeah,

1652
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:34,963
this is your brain.

1653
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,440
This is your brain onto a bill.

1654
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:37,310
Hicks had a great bit about,

1655
00:44:37,311 --> 00:44:37,521
well,

1656
00:44:37,521 --> 00:44:39,680
every comic at the time had
a great panel about that.

1657
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:42,110
Bill Hicks had a particularly
brilliant one about that,

1658
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,880
but how preposterous it was.

1659
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:44,660
You know,

1660
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:44,840
there,

1661
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:49,100
you remember those commercials that came
on after nine 11 where a guy was a no

1662
00:44:49,101 --> 00:44:52,790
nonsense guy in a steakhouse
with a suit on eating a salad.

1663
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,660
And his friend was like the silly
man and his friend were like,

1664
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:56,871
man,

1665
00:44:56,871 --> 00:44:58,190
you can't tell me that.

1666
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,030
You know,

1667
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,140
if I smoke pot,

1668
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,490
I'm supporting terrorism.

1669
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:02,983
Yes I can.

1670
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:03,800
And he's eating,

1671
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,400
eating the lettuce.

1672
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,233
You know why?

1673
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:06,913
Because it's true.

1674
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,413
That's a drag show.

1675
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,770
Like a no nonsense man with his suit on.

1676
00:45:11,771 --> 00:45:12,610
I'm eating a salad.

1677
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:13,520
I'll tell you right now,

1678
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:17,020
most of the drugs that
use or put terrorism,

1679
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:18,490
marijuana,

1680
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:19,540
fuck man,

1681
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:21,450
they're the most retarded.

1682
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,370
There's no logic to them.

1683
00:45:23,371 --> 00:45:25,350
The appeal to the weakest of emotions,

1684
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:29,100
the desire to be this fat
douchebag eating a steak salad,

1685
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:29,510
okay?

1686
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:30,050
You know,

1687
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,820
so you know it with a
suit on and a runner.

1688
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:32,950
I'm a no nonsense man.

1689
00:45:32,951 --> 00:45:34,600
Was Bob's always working.

1690
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:35,703
That's right.

1691
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,370
He's a disciplined business man.

1692
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:38,560
Cause it's true.

1693
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,640
Taking any nonsense,

1694
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,040
you know it's fucking tree.

1695
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:41,231
You know,

1696
00:45:41,231 --> 00:45:42,880
Alex is a no nonsense man,

1697
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,860
that fucking pig in New York.

1698
00:45:44,861 --> 00:45:46,030
Who makes those women?

1699
00:45:46,031 --> 00:45:46,990
He netted.

1700
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:48,610
Did you see that shit?

1701
00:45:48,611 --> 00:45:51,220
Crazy fucking beefy piece a shit.

1702
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,660
There's like these two
apparently out there,

1703
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:58,020
there's these two distinctions
and the police there in,

1704
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:01,240
they're calling the white collar
police and the blue collar police.

1705
00:46:01,241 --> 00:46:04,840
The guys in the blue suits are apparently
just being policed and they're cool,

1706
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:10,020
but they're these violent kind of like
a thug pigs out there who have been like

1707
00:46:10,571 --> 00:46:11,750
grabbing people.

1708
00:46:11,751 --> 00:46:13,000
You weren't doing anything.

1709
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,950
And I saw the video of
the girls getting maced.

1710
00:46:15,951 --> 00:46:16,930
Did you see that video?

1711
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:17,430
Yeah.

1712
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:20,340
It looks like this is the girl tried to
pull down the barrier and then he just

1713
00:46:20,341 --> 00:46:20,911
amazes her.

1714
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:21,744
Is that what happen?

1715
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,070
No,

1716
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:22,191
no,

1717
00:46:22,191 --> 00:46:22,311
no.

1718
00:46:22,311 --> 00:46:24,500
I watched it a bunch of times
and I didn't see her do that.

1719
00:46:24,501 --> 00:46:25,570
And if she did do that,

1720
00:46:25,571 --> 00:46:27,380
you can then you can't make him.

1721
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:28,960
But he didn't just make her,

1722
00:46:28,961 --> 00:46:30,670
he makes it a Mason Mason.

1723
00:46:30,671 --> 00:46:32,000
He amazed a bunch of them.

1724
00:46:32,001 --> 00:46:32,270
Yeah.

1725
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:32,961
For no reason.

1726
00:46:32,961 --> 00:46:33,860
For no reason.

1727
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:34,250
Yeah.

1728
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,650
And then he skis Kinda like skittered off.

1729
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:36,940
Yeah,

1730
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:37,180
he did.

1731
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:37,760
He did.

1732
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,720
He came in,

1733
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:39,201
did it,

1734
00:46:39,201 --> 00:46:40,370
and then try to sneak away.

1735
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,020
They got a picture of the son of a bitch.

1736
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:42,800
It's on,

1737
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,633
you can look at,

1738
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:44,750
what's the name of that thing?

1739
00:46:44,751 --> 00:46:46,130
It's occupy Wall Street.

1740
00:46:46,131 --> 00:46:46,964
Is that what it's called?

1741
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:47,390
Yeah.

1742
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:48,201
On that site,

1743
00:46:48,201 --> 00:46:51,560
occupy Wall street.org I think
there's a picture of the guy.

1744
00:46:51,561 --> 00:46:54,350
They got a picture of him and they're
trying to find them because they've got

1745
00:46:54,351 --> 00:46:58,340
lawyers who are volunteering to help
the people get out of jail and help the

1746
00:46:58,341 --> 00:46:59,180
people who are like,

1747
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:00,980
they've already arrested
at a hundred people

1748
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:02,861
and what are they doing?

1749
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:03,820
They're protesting what?

1750
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,640
See that's they're protesting.

1751
00:47:05,641 --> 00:47:09,120
The idea is they're protesting the fact
that 1% of the people on the planet

1752
00:47:09,121 --> 00:47:11,940
control the resources and they're
going to Wall Street because that's a,

1753
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:14,790
that seems to be like
the locus of all this,

1754
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:16,020
like a greed.

1755
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,160
There's great video.

1756
00:47:17,161 --> 00:47:21,330
There's video of like these really like
rich people sitting out on the balcony

1757
00:47:21,331 --> 00:47:26,331
drinking champagne and
toasting the protest or all
these like Super Richie rich

1758
00:47:26,401 --> 00:47:27,900
is out there just to watch and I'm like,

1759
00:47:27,901 --> 00:47:28,980
they're like fucking with them.

1760
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:29,330
Yeah.

1761
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:30,400
Kinda really?

1762
00:47:30,401 --> 00:47:31,234
Yeah.

1763
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:31,570
Wow.

1764
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:31,811
You know,

1765
00:47:31,811 --> 00:47:32,800
like there are novelty.

1766
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:33,670
It's like look,

1767
00:47:33,671 --> 00:47:35,500
oh look at the protesters.

1768
00:47:35,501 --> 00:47:36,610
What I keep hearing,

1769
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:40,720
I keep hearing that no one's
covering this in the mainstream news.

1770
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,681
I keep hearing that.

1771
00:47:41,681 --> 00:47:43,900
But then I'm looking@bloomberg.com
and it's on there.

1772
00:47:43,901 --> 00:47:45,070
It's on business insider.

1773
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,550
I think they've started covering,

1774
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,560
covering like they have to because
people are starting to get arrested.

1775
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:51,310
Yeah,

1776
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:51,910
that's it.

1777
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:52,600
Is that what it is?

1778
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,570
But I don't know the real
number of people that,

1779
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:55,870
that are out there right now.

1780
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:57,260
I would love to,

1781
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:58,870
and this is fascinating.

1782
00:47:58,871 --> 00:47:59,980
This is a new movement.

1783
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:00,850
Yep.

1784
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:01,990
And it's happening right now.

1785
00:48:01,991 --> 00:48:02,171
I mean,

1786
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:02,441
if you're,

1787
00:48:02,441 --> 00:48:03,251
if you're in New York,

1788
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:03,881
you could go down there.

1789
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,910
Right now I'm bringing him a
sandwich cause they gotta be hungry,

1790
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,151
man.

1791
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:07,990
A lot of these kids,

1792
00:48:07,991 --> 00:48:08,890
they don't look like they don't.

1793
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,420
They've been out there for eight days.

1794
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:13,450
Nearly a hundred people have been
arrested for protesting in and around Wall

1795
00:48:13,451 --> 00:48:14,051
Street during what?

1796
00:48:14,051 --> 00:48:17,890
Some are calling the Arab
spring of the United States.

1797
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:18,521
Outraged.

1798
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:19,300
Oh Wow.

1799
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,140
That's scary.

1800
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,990
I know you think about what's going on.

1801
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:28,690
These Arab countries outrage over the
way that the political and financial

1802
00:48:28,691 --> 00:48:29,441
worlds are managed.

1803
00:48:29,441 --> 00:48:33,610
Protesters calling themselves in 99% of
gathered to share their grievances with

1804
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:36,190
the top 1% of America and demand change.

1805
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:36,941
Well,

1806
00:48:36,941 --> 00:48:39,520
I don't understand why
it's illegal to protest.

1807
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,260
I thought protesting was always legal.

1808
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:41,980
Is it your,

1809
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:45,430
you have to get a permit to protest and
that these people don't have permits?

1810
00:48:45,431 --> 00:48:45,880
Is that what it is?

1811
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,910
I think that they,

1812
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:48,950
they did get per,

1813
00:48:48,951 --> 00:48:49,600
I don't know.

1814
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,260
I'm sure.

1815
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,950
I wouldn't be surprised if there
was like they didn't have a permit.

1816
00:48:53,951 --> 00:48:56,350
Seems gross that you should need
to get permission to protest.

1817
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:58,120
It seems like there should
be some sort of a right,

1818
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:00,520
but I don't know if you should be
able to do it on someone's property.

1819
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:03,010
Like if you're blocking
them fucking traffic.

1820
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:03,310
Yeah.

1821
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,250
That shit's annoying mean.

1822
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:04,700
Yeah.

1823
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,970
It does seem to go counter
to the idea of a protest,

1824
00:49:06,971 --> 00:49:07,570
which is like,

1825
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,160
can I have your permission to protest?

1826
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:10,450
You're just supposed to protest.

1827
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:10,691
Yeah.

1828
00:49:10,691 --> 00:49:10,991
I mean,

1829
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:11,261
look,

1830
00:49:11,261 --> 00:49:12,410
it's something I,

1831
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:12,840
you know,

1832
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,320
I support them.

1833
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:15,190
They're doing something,

1834
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:15,491
you know,

1835
00:49:15,491 --> 00:49:15,631
they're,

1836
00:49:15,631 --> 00:49:16,900
they're out there beating the drum.

1837
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:17,780
They're letting everybody know,

1838
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,070
hey,

1839
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:18,311
we're,

1840
00:49:18,311 --> 00:49:19,360
we are pissed off.

1841
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:20,231
But to say it,

1842
00:49:20,231 --> 00:49:20,830
it's like,

1843
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:22,510
it's like an Arab spring
in the United States.

1844
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:24,240
That's fascinating what people are saying.

1845
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:24,521
I mean,

1846
00:49:24,521 --> 00:49:25,240
it's like people,

1847
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:29,710
this whole thing of like 1% of the
fucking population having all the shit.

1848
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:30,693
It's like,

1849
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:33,100
it's some point that
that can't work anymore.

1850
00:49:33,101 --> 00:49:33,980
Like if you're on an a,

1851
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:37,450
let's imagine we're on an island and one,

1852
00:49:37,451 --> 00:49:41,440
there's like 10 people on the island and
one person on the island has control of

1853
00:49:41,441 --> 00:49:42,400
all the bananas.

1854
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,070
It's like you got to share the bananas,

1855
00:49:45,071 --> 00:49:45,900
man.

1856
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,290
You gotta pass the bananas around.

1857
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:48,370
I don't care how you got them.

1858
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:49,151
Right.

1859
00:49:49,151 --> 00:49:51,370
And the idea is that you
look at the end of the day,

1860
00:49:51,371 --> 00:49:53,560
you're using up the earth's resources.

1861
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,011
If you're,

1862
00:49:54,011 --> 00:49:57,460
especially if you're talking like
some big gigantic corporation,

1863
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:59,950
you're using up a gigantic
chunk of the earth's resources,

1864
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:00,940
which you know,

1865
00:50:00,941 --> 00:50:05,740
really in all fairness
should be distributed equally
for all the people on the

1866
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:06,470
planet.

1867
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,660
We just don't have the technology.

1868
00:50:07,661 --> 00:50:08,494
You had to do it.

1869
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:12,820
And also a lot of the people who have the
resources would get distributed to are

1870
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:13,720
fucking idiots,

1871
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:13,961
right?

1872
00:50:13,961 --> 00:50:17,890
So that is a real problem because a
lot of people are not had because our

1873
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:19,480
education system is crap.

1874
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:23,560
So people have been being like brought
up through a really crappy education

1875
00:50:23,561 --> 00:50:23,831
system.

1876
00:50:23,831 --> 00:50:25,300
Not all schools are terrible,

1877
00:50:25,301 --> 00:50:26,134
but a lot of them,

1878
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:27,130
they had these,

1879
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,520
they have way too many kids.

1880
00:50:28,521 --> 00:50:31,430
How are you going to teach a
classroom of 60 fucking kids?

1881
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:35,420
Many of them in like who are living
in poverty and their parents are drug

1882
00:50:35,421 --> 00:50:35,960
addicts.

1883
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,860
How are you going to do that?

1884
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,930
You'd have to be superman
to pull that off.

1885
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,630
So it's like the year
you're dealing with like,

1886
00:50:41,631 --> 00:50:41,990
uh,

1887
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:45,200
people who haven't been educated
and people who are hopeless.

1888
00:50:45,201 --> 00:50:46,790
And so the real question is,

1889
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:51,791
let's imagine that all the 1% that these
people are protesting suddenly like

1890
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:52,551
more like,

1891
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:53,061
you know what?

1892
00:50:53,061 --> 00:50:54,530
We're going to distribute our wealth.

1893
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:55,760
How do you do that?

1894
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:57,320
Like how would you even do it anyway?

1895
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:58,310
Like what's the,

1896
00:50:58,310 --> 00:50:58,910
how do you,

1897
00:50:58,910 --> 00:50:59,743
how do you solve?

1898
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:00,560
I don't know.

1899
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,880
But they're saying we
have to do something.

1900
00:51:01,881 --> 00:51:02,570
That's what I'm saying.

1901
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:03,320
They're right.

1902
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:03,711
They're right.

1903
00:51:03,711 --> 00:51:05,120
The system is completely fucked up.

1904
00:51:05,121 --> 00:51:05,780
It doesn't work.

1905
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:06,440
It's not,

1906
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,810
it doesn't make sense that you,

1907
00:51:07,811 --> 00:51:07,980
you,

1908
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:11,510
you like the whole idea
of the financial system.

1909
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:11,781
You know,

1910
00:51:11,781 --> 00:51:15,110
the whole idea of when you started talking
about banks and economics and numbers

1911
00:51:15,111 --> 00:51:16,070
and manipulating things.

1912
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:19,530
And then things get so weird when you
talk about like interest rates and they

1913
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:23,390
talk about taxes and you talk about
the distribution of the money.

1914
00:51:23,391 --> 00:51:24,021
Where does the tax,

1915
00:51:24,021 --> 00:51:24,551
when they going,

1916
00:51:24,551 --> 00:51:25,040
or is it,

1917
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,110
when you break all these numbers down,

1918
00:51:27,111 --> 00:51:31,040
then you realize that these
numbers only represent numbers.

1919
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:35,180
They don't represent a
fucking bag of gold somewhere.

1920
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:35,510
Nope.

1921
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:38,240
They don't represent
anything of real value.

1922
00:51:38,241 --> 00:51:39,200
It's like number.

1923
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:44,201
So then when someone has no fucking
$18 billion or something crazy,

1924
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:45,971
and then you,

1925
00:51:45,971 --> 00:51:46,141
you,

1926
00:51:46,141 --> 00:51:47,330
you examine them and you go,

1927
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:48,080
what did you do?

1928
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:48,351
Well,

1929
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,370
I moved numbers,

1930
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:54,560
I move numbers around and I made billions
of dollars moving all these numbers

1931
00:51:55,251 --> 00:51:58,150
and buying and selling
numbers and agreeing and,

1932
00:51:58,170 --> 00:51:58,611
and,

1933
00:51:58,611 --> 00:52:00,920
and Graham Hancock's here.

1934
00:52:00,921 --> 00:52:01,520
Cool.

1935
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,180
Powerful.

1936
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,013
All right folks.

1937
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,100
That's the end of this one.

1938
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:07,250
And we'll be right back in about 15
minutes cause he's gonna eat some food,

1939
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:08,323
but thank you.

1940
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:09,240
Yep.
