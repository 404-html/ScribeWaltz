1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,560
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:01,771
Yeah.

3
00:00:01,771 --> 00:00:04,640
I always assumed we would be hanging
out all the time from now on from,

4
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:05,440
from that point on.

5
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,510
But it really didn't work out that way.

6
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,013
No,

7
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,520
no,

8
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,353
it never does,

9
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:09,870
you know?

10
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:10,050
No.

11
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:10,290
Yeah,

12
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,050
that's true because everybody
goes in such different directions.

13
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,960
I've ran into Maura a once or twice.

14
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:20,160
I know rents are once we had a good time
at one of those NBC functions and I was

15
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:24,150
on Newsradio or fear factor and she
was on er and we got drunk together.

16
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:25,020
It was a great time.

17
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,880
It was all like the old days.

18
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,650
The mind is always fun to get drunk.

19
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,551
Oh yeah.

20
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:30,690
She's one of the best ever.

21
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,560
You know,

22
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,080
she was the one who convinced me
to kick in the craft service door.

23
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,180
We're all hungry.

24
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,343
Uh,

25
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:37,590
yeah.

26
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,720
We had some good times on
that set after the set.

27
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,501
After filming,

28
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:42,210
we would basically just drink all night,

29
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,163
you know,

30
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,940
filming would be done at whatever and we
all have our mini fridge is stocked in

31
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:52,500
our coolers and we would just get hammered
and just shoot the shit and have fun

32
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:55,350
and laugh and go over Dave's room
and listen to some weird music.

33
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,650
Dave always had some weird chicks that
made you want to cry laying in a few of

34
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:00,991
them.

35
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:01,824
The dated.

36
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:02,390
Yeah.

37
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:02,750
Yeah.

38
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,430
Just,

39
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,140
you know,

40
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:04,973
strange,

41
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,760
somber women voices and a,

42
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:09,191
and then we,

43
00:01:09,191 --> 00:01:09,341
yeah,

44
00:01:09,341 --> 00:01:10,290
somebody would be there till,

45
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,610
till it was time to go to Denny's.

46
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:12,750
Right.

47
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,160
Or we would go to a,

48
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,990
down the street when we
were at sunset Gower,

49
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:17,340
we would go down to that bar.

50
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,271
What was it called?

51
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:21,690
There was like a liquor in the industry
bar look really catered to people that

52
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:22,650
were leaving the set.

53
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:23,181
Well,

54
00:01:23,181 --> 00:01:23,350
the,

55
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,700
well,

56
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,533
right next to the

57
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,070
peanut.

58
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,700
Was that what it was?

59
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,340
Yeah,

60
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,000
it was to be the Columbia bar and grill.

61
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,280
Yeah,

62
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,610
yeah,

63
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,390
yeah,

64
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,641
yeah.

65
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:35,190
I'd be like all the people from
a Fraser and a dal is weird.

66
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:35,810
It'd be there.

67
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,170
Yeah.

68
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:36,370
Go.

69
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,830
And he wouldn't be stiff as fuck.

70
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:41,580
We would be hammered and they would be
all still like doing their actor thing.

71
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:41,821
You know,

72
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:43,350
I thought it was a marvelous performance.

73
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:44,820
I think he was quite lovely.

74
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,830
Did you know that it's on Broadway now.

75
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:46,990
I'll,

76
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,823
I'll be amazing.

77
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:48,930
I've got to see it.

78
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:49,220
You know,

79
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,230
they were just all completely full of
shit and he would come in and try and grab

80
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:53,430
everybody's Dick and you know,

81
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,190
Dave and I would be
hammered more hammered.

82
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,313
Yeah.

83
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,940
And Julie being and certainly being,

84
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:00,121
yeah,

85
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,010
we'd all be laughing and joking around.

86
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:02,700
Yeah.

87
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,330
It was a great,

88
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,200
great group of humans.

89
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,750
That was one of the most
fun times of my entire life,

90
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,250
those years.

91
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:08,941
It was amazing.

92
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:11,370
There was one time I remember
we were about to go and do it.

93
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:13,170
There was a live audience there
and everybody was getting written,

94
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,690
getting ready and we were standing in
that little back hallway where they would

95
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:17,580
introduce us and I said,

96
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,610
you know,

97
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,220
that this is going to
be one of those days.

98
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,270
We're going to look back,

99
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:22,650
uh,

100
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,180
when we're older and we're going to go,

101
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:26,250
I can't believe I didn't enjoy this more.

102
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,590
I can't believe I didn't
appreciate how crazy.

103
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:29,424
This is more.

104
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,200
You don't realize what a random stroke
of luck it is to get so many cool people

105
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:38,100
all together in one group.

106
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:38,460
Yeah.

107
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,350
The fact that yeah,

108
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,760
we all want it to spend time together.

109
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,300
Uh,

110
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,820
like,

111
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,340
like when work was done,

112
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:45,240
nobody wanted to go.

113
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:46,200
Everyone wanted to stay.

114
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,060
We'd also get the feeds from other,

115
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,451
other,

116
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:48,750
um,

117
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,170
oh yeah.

118
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,890
The other shows and other sets we
get to watch other horrible sitcoms.

119
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,970
Greg Geraldo had had a show
that was a good one actually.

120
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,670
Yeah.

121
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,720
And so to Joey Lawrence,

122
00:02:57,721 --> 00:02:58,510
do you remember that?

123
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:58,631
Oh,

124
00:02:58,631 --> 00:02:59,270
I only,

125
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:04,270
I mostly just remember him sitting in his
convertible playing his own cds really

126
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:05,080
loud.

127
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,910
He always had bad ass cars.

128
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:11,440
Like Joey Lawrence always had like the
newest Ferrari or the newest Bentley or

129
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,101
whatever the hell it was.

130
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:14,110
But he'd sit there playing
his own music loud,

131
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,940
super loud with a Bandanna on.

132
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,380
Where is he now?

133
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:17,711
Man.

134
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:19,060
Intentionally ripped jeans.

135
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,890
He was just in dancing
with the stars recently?

136
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,370
Well I think Dave said it best even
back then was that someone needs to tell

137
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,450
that young man that he's gay.

138
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,360
And that's exactly how you said it too.

139
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,390
We stopped and we were looking there
and there was a couple of them and you,

140
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:33,911
you just,

141
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:35,200
you just stopped and paused and said,

142
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:36,640
someone needs to tell
that young man he's gay.

143
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,463
We went into work.

144
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,261
I mean he would be right.

145
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:42,090
You don't know where these,

146
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,070
where these cars were parked and right
directly in front of the building.

147
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,990
So you'd open up the door and you know,

148
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:50,740
you basically be on the set and right
behind that is this fucking guy in his car

149
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,340
blaring his own music from
isn't some insane stereo system.

150
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:54,630
It's like,

151
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,920
and if your music is the is great,

152
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,100
it's wrong to sit there and listen
to your own music in the car.

153
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,370
Yeah.

154
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,630
Robert Plant is in his car fucking
beating the drums to his steering wheel.

155
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,531
It'd be like,

156
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:06,050
what the fuck?

157
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:06,380
Robbery.

158
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,160
Really?

159
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,510
You don't get enough attention.

160
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,191
But when you,

161
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:11,024
Joey Lawrence,

162
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,050
now you've just started
to stand up recently,

163
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,400
which is a fascinating thing to me because
I always thought you'd be a brilliant

164
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:19,690
standing up because you're a great writer.

165
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,090
And when we used to do those
little things in the audience,

166
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:26,050
you remember where we would talk to the
audience before you would fuck around

167
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:28,450
with them every now and then
and you wouldn't like do it.

168
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,040
Like Phil had a routine that he was doing,

169
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:33,220
like Phil actually started
doing standup because of,

170
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:33,490
you know,

171
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,720
wanting to entertain the audience.

172
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:38,080
So he had a bunch of bits that he would
do like Clinton impressions and they

173
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:39,250
were really good and it was like,

174
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,701
I'm just like,

175
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:40,421
Holy Shit Dude.

176
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:41,470
You're like a real comic.

177
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:42,370
Like you're a standup.

178
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,590
It's like Kinda thinking about doing.

179
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,160
Phil was like this really
unusual human being.

180
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:48,701
Very,

181
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:49,930
very fascinating guy.

182
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,793
Yeah.

183
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:51,880
He was the world.

184
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,470
He was like a great hobbyist.

185
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,220
Yeah.

186
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,390
He would go so deep.

187
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:55,571
He will,

188
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:56,830
he got into flying,

189
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,530
which is actually how I found
out about this neighborhood.

190
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,101
You know,

191
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:00,791
fill a,

192
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,010
was taking me out into
the valley looking for,

193
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:03,221
you know,

194
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:04,350
different places where he could,

195
00:05:04,351 --> 00:05:04,600
you know,

196
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,100
go and have a nice view.

197
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,670
You know,

198
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,350
we went up in this little
single engine plane,

199
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:12,160
but I remember when he first
started getting into the flying boy,

200
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:15,310
he was reading book after
book in between rehearsals.

201
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,430
He'd be studying his pilot's book
like they've done with the little fake

202
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:19,170
broadcast booth.

203
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:19,870
Yeah.

204
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,440
Very.

205
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,310
He was very,

206
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:22,360
very disciplined.

207
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,490
He would,

208
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,560
well he said Phil was like a big league
version of Mark McKinney from kids in

209
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:27,394
the hall.

210
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,710
Smart Bikini was really into
his flight simulator bill.

211
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,770
Learn to fly a plane,

212
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,010
you know,

213
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:34,510
loved it.

214
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,830
He learned to fly a plane.

215
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:36,970
He learned to sail a boat.

216
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,210
You know,

217
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,290
he was one of those guys,

218
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,040
you know,

219
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,500
he's a,

220
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,830
if only he had learned to duck mobile.

221
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:46,510
Not even if you learn to just separate
from fucking crazy people I know had

222
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:46,990
some,

223
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:47,291
we,

224
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:47,710
you know,

225
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,341
we all did,

226
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:51,400
I think had talks with him
many times about divorce.

227
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:51,581
You know,

228
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:53,110
like you got to get out of that man.

229
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:53,530
Yeah.

230
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,210
It was one of those things where we would,

231
00:05:55,211 --> 00:05:55,361
uh,

232
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:56,440
we would have these parties.

233
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:56,651
I mean,

234
00:05:56,651 --> 00:06:00,710
Paul had one party once and I remember
we were all at this bar somewhere and

235
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:06,100
Phil showed up with the wife and she was
saying the creepiest shit insulting him

236
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:08,211
and you know,

237
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:11,210
talking about how she likes pickup
trucks because they reminder of,

238
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:11,721
you know,

239
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:14,620
boys that she used to bang back
when she was younger and just,

240
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,160
just,

241
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,490
just torturing him,

242
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,370
just torture and talking about,

243
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,440
oh well you're not fail.

244
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:19,641
You know,

245
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:23,270
it feels too old and he's just like
women thrown on him all the time.

246
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:25,940
It seems like if he was miserable
that you would have just,

247
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,691
it doesn't matter man,

248
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:27,860
when you have children with somebody,

249
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,520
you're inexorably attached forever.

250
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:35,300
Was the thought of being separated from
his kids and I understand because at the

251
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:37,040
time I was separated from my kids.

252
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,903
Yeah.

253
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:38,211
Yeah,

254
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:38,650
I know.

255
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,170
You know,

256
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,820
I completely see where he was coming from.

257
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:41,810
He didn't want a divorce.

258
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:43,790
He thought his wife is with all her flaws,

259
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,100
was still very good to
the kids and you know,

260
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:46,730
and he felt,

261
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,100
felt like he could work it out
and then he really got into pot,

262
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:49,581
you know,

263
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:50,270
that was his thing.

264
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,110
He would just get,

265
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,973
he's lazy.

266
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:52,400
Yeah,

267
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,090
I was luck.

268
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:53,281
Yeah.

269
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:56,890
You'd be sitting in his Mercedes in the
parking space with his one hitter baked

270
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,270
baked to the gills stone.

271
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,290
And you weren't smoking weed,

272
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,540
smoking weed with Phil Hartman.

273
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,374
That would barely,

274
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:03,891
yeah.

275
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:04,210
Yeah.

276
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:04,631
You didn't do any,

277
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:05,360
any drugs?

278
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,380
Just get drunk.

279
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,330
And so I would do,

280
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,451
people don't know,

281
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:10,910
a lot of people don't even
realize news radio wasn't a hit,

282
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:12,830
but why we were on the air.

283
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,701
We were on the air.

284
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:15,410
We moved nine times,

285
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,390
nine times over the
course of five seasons.

286
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:20,140
And the guy had the
head of programming at,

287
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,451
at,

288
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:20,940
at,

289
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,460
uh,

290
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,690
scheduling at NBC.

291
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,533
Hated us.

292
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,463
Why was that?

293
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:24,921
I don't know.

294
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:25,161
Remember,

295
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:26,200
there's that whole thing with,

296
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:26,720
uh,

297
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,100
the rolling stone article.

298
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,493
Uh,

299
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,210
but that was when we
were already floundering.

300
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,411
But it was also,

301
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:33,990
but the guy,

302
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,561
this guy,

303
00:07:34,561 --> 00:07:35,030
uh,

304
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,170
we should tell people what that means.

305
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,600
What's the rolling the rolling start out.

306
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,910
Nicole Paul Stanley or Paul Stanley.

307
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,460
Yeah.

308
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,870
Kiss Paul Simms,

309
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,000
who was the creator of the show called,

310
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,330
uh,

311
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,980
nbcs Thursday night lineup,

312
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:47,960
which was their big friends lineup.

313
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,730
They called it a shit sandwich.

314
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,361
He called.

315
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:50,901
It was really,

316
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:55,190
it should have been shit was the bun
because they're real sandwich was friends

317
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,640
and then you would have friends on and
then you would have this terrible show

318
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,410
and it was always on after friends.

319
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,150
And obviously NBC was very upset that
Paul was calling sex in the city or the

320
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,920
single guy to pieces of shit.

321
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:07,851
But you know,

322
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:08,301
they were,

323
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:09,350
they were terrible shows.

324
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:11,990
And then friends was as brilliant
show that everybody tuned into.

325
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,750
So they sort of watch those other
shows just because they were on.

326
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,560
But I guess it guy,

327
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,393
the cantors,

328
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,870
Preston Beckmann hated our show.

329
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:18,920
Even when we did the pilot,

330
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:21,570
he didn't want it picked up well because
we were originally supposed to get a

331
00:08:21,571 --> 00:08:23,030
Thursday slot ourselves.

332
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,780
But this guy who was in charge of the
MVC schedule wouldn't let us have it

333
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:27,620
Thursday slot.

334
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,470
So then he basically kept trying
to find a slot that would kill us.

335
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,330
So that's why they put us on,

336
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,230
uh,

337
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,730
what we are the leading we're,

338
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,440
we're on with wings and Fraser,

339
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,750
uh,

340
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,550
phrasing and those shows were both doing
poorly when we came along and he put us

341
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:45,100
on with those shows and we are our,

342
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,690
we boosted the ratings of both shows.

343
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,590
Well all of sudden it became
like a decent lineup for,

344
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:51,111
for comedies,

345
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:53,180
but it was a different time then man.

346
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,930
There was no dvrs and
shows couldn't exist in a,

347
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,470
in a non popular spot.

348
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,870
It had to be a spot where people
are already looking for the ratings.

349
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:01,650
We were getting in those,

350
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,460
we're getting like 10 million people
tuning in and those ratings and those days

351
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,350
were considered a ratings failure.

352
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,161
Like today,

353
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:09,150
if you've got those ratings here,

354
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:10,500
the number one show on TV,

355
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,460
it's weird.

356
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,230
And then because there's
so many channels now,

357
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:14,220
at one point in time,

358
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:14,610
uh,

359
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,610
Lou Martin used to show up at our writer's
meetings at the rather at the table

360
00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:24,510
read was t with a t shirt on with
the number of whatever we were in,

361
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,350
what place are in.

362
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,350
And he showed up and it was
84 84th place and we're like,

363
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:31,771
what was it,

364
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,020
84 88 and my name.

365
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:33,741
And that's when,

366
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:34,230
when they finally,

367
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,670
when they,

368
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,820
they put us up against Drew Carey and
we have Warren Littlefield actually came

369
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:41,670
down to a table read to let us
know that they still loved us.

370
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,350
They surface Turkey dinner.

371
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,071
Oh,

372
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:49,071
you never learn or like there was there
carving Turkey and Warren Littlefield

373
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,110
who was a nice guy or a network head.

374
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:55,291
Yeah.

375
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:55,990
He was very nice.

376
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,460
This,

377
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:01,460
I always remember a 95 Warren Littlefield
dancing on the bar in New York at when

378
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,300
we went for the upfronts and it was like
Jay Leno had had just hit number was

379
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,680
the number one late night show.

380
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,420
Wow.

381
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,670
And have more of a standing on
this bar doing shots and shouting.

382
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:12,980
19 nine.

383
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,101
Oh Wow.

384
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:15,470
Again,

385
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,730
that's hilarious.

386
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,150
Was that the one where,

387
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,040
which one did you guys get drunk at?

388
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,830
I didn't go and you guys
get the rock every event.

389
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,450
But we got kicked out where
we weren't allowed to go.

390
00:10:25,451 --> 00:10:26,850
It was at the Sag awards.

391
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,460
These motherfuckers got so hammered.

392
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,040
They caused so much
damage at the sag awards.

393
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,450
We couldn't go anymore.

394
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,530
We weren't allowed to go.

395
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,670
I've still never been back.

396
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,853
Here's a great one.

397
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,640
And we were at the Emmy's and this is
after Phil had been murdered and we're

398
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,720
sitting there and you know,

399
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:44,790
Phil was nominated for something and,

400
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:45,210
uh,

401
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:45,581
the,

402
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:47,850
the nominations go and I
think the guy from Frasier,

403
00:10:47,851 --> 00:10:48,200
God,

404
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,000
David Hyde Pierce and
Dave turns to me and goes,

405
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,530
what does Phil have to do to win?

406
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,483
Like,

407
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,560
oh no,

408
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,151
you know,

409
00:10:59,151 --> 00:10:59,984
it was so,

410
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,770
it was in David.

411
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,620
David Hyde Pierce looks so
embarrassed to be winning.

412
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,851
He was literally up there,

413
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:06,051
like,

414
00:11:06,051 --> 00:11:08,040
is all the blood drained out of his face?

415
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,933
He was just going,

416
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,080
um,

417
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,190
well obviously Phil Hartman and um,

418
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:14,470
you know,

419
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,831
and he didn't,

420
00:11:14,831 --> 00:11:16,520
he couldn't even put a sentence together.

421
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,900
He was wonder what the
choice behind that was.

422
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:19,590
That was weird.

423
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,423
I don't know.

424
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,091
Don't,

425
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:25,800
don't kill someone and then expect them
to win sort of message you're sending

426
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:26,790
out to Burger's eating.

427
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,763
It's cheating.

428
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,300
Being murdered as a cheat.

429
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,070
Oh,

430
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,210
what a strange,

431
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:34,044
strange times.

432
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,410
So what did you guys do at the Sag
awards that got us kicked out forever?

433
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,070
I think,

434
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,510
uh,

435
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,340
most you're just,

436
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,613
uh,

437
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,551
at the time I guess,

438
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:45,840
cause we all thought what
a stupid awards show,

439
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,100
you know,

440
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,610
just the first year of the SAG awards.

441
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,580
And we said this is ridiculous.

442
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:54,500
Why actors voting about
other and giving awards,

443
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,500
saying who's best.

444
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,510
That's the,

445
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:57,880
you know,

446
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,010
our union is deciding who is
best and it creates this weird,

447
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,820
this like culture of
ass kissing and fakery.

448
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,921
They're all like,

449
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:08,300
what a wonderful project.

450
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:08,490
You know,

451
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,323
an amazing,

452
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,313
and I think what we do,

453
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,101
I think more,

454
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:12,360
and I found where the,

455
00:12:12,361 --> 00:12:12,720
uh,

456
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:12,961
the,

457
00:12:12,961 --> 00:12:13,290
uh,

458
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:18,290
the service bar was and you would have
had like the big industrial corkscrew and

459
00:12:19,111 --> 00:12:20,030
everything sweet.

460
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,300
So we're going back there just opening
up bottles of wine and bringing them up

461
00:12:24,301 --> 00:12:25,590
to the table and I think,

462
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,250
you know,

463
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:26,540
and then,

464
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:26,790
you know,

465
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,930
we had to Andy with this too.

466
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,700
Yeah.

467
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,250
Uh,

468
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:34,250
which was so who did what and we do
anything notable that got us kicked out.

469
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:34,711
Uh,

470
00:12:34,711 --> 00:12:35,401
I don't really remember.

471
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:38,350
I think we were just
noisy and rude and uh,

472
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,241
stealing.

473
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:43,380
We were applauding inappropriately and
he's really where it was a cast where you

474
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,120
regularly hear people say,

475
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,560
you know what might joke doesn't work.

476
00:12:46,561 --> 00:12:48,990
We should cut my joke that
his joke is the better joke.

477
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:49,590
Yes.

478
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,251
All the time.

479
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:50,640
You know,

480
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,660
it was really amazing environment.

481
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:53,830
And you would also hear,

482
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:55,840
don't put that pencil in my cunt.

483
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,340
I mean,

484
00:12:59,340 --> 00:12:59,590
yeah,

485
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,720
I would just say the
most fucked up shit ever.

486
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:02,420
I mean if we were,

487
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,620
do you remember the time we had the,

488
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,320
we actually had to sit down and we,

489
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:05,681
we,

490
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:07,720
they played that presentation for us.

491
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,251
Oh the,

492
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:08,630
uh,

493
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,170
the sex sexual harassment.

494
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,381
Oh,

495
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:13,100
I felt so badly for that
person read it was that,

496
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,000
you don't know,

497
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,080
you don't know the group of people
you've just walked in front of.

498
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,040
It was so ridiculous.

499
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,250
They have to go over this whole thing
of what's appropriate and what's not

500
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:23,971
appropriate.

501
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:28,650
And it would have meant basically what
it cut down about 98% of all conversation

502
00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:29,484
on our sex.

503
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,740
I mean we all just sort of,

504
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,100
uh,

505
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,431
you know,

506
00:13:32,431 --> 00:13:34,380
just made an agreement that
we wouldn't so each other

507
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,170
like,

508
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,003
okay

509
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,411
fly.

510
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:38,830
Right.

511
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,060
Cause what if anybody wanted to,

512
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:42,220
I mean there's been many
times on sets where,

513
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,530
uh,

514
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:42,731
you know,

515
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:44,260
especially women,

516
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:47,710
actresses feel like there's too much of
that shit going on and they just fucking

517
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:48,190
fuck this.

518
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,390
I'm getting a lawyer and
then there's payouts.

519
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:50,661
Man.

520
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:52,070
It becomes like a big issue.

521
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,450
You make a lot of money.

522
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,570
I know cause everyone like eat have Andy
and you'd be sitting there at to Vicki

523
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:57,770
Guy,

524
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,610
they get us on stuff.

525
00:13:58,611 --> 00:14:02,510
Your pussy leaves mud.

526
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,053
Vicky.

527
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:09,780
Vicky would be laughing the very
first time I met Andy again,

528
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,550
I'd been acting for a fucking month.

529
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:11,851
Right?

530
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,380
I'd done no new,

531
00:14:13,381 --> 00:14:14,400
no one like that.

532
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,460
I grew up with fighters and pool hustlers.

533
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:17,641
The,

534
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:21,420
those are the two worlds that I was
most entrenched in and crazy standup

535
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:21,901
comedians.

536
00:14:21,901 --> 00:14:22,501
They're all nuts,

537
00:14:22,501 --> 00:14:22,980
right?

538
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,020
And then all of a sudden I'm in this,

539
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:29,050
this dressing room with Andy and Andy is
sitting cross legged and he has clogs.

540
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:30,960
Okay.

541
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,070
And he's got these weird brown corduroy
pants and he's like flipping his foot

542
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:35,761
back and forth.

543
00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:36,190
He goes,

544
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,500
do you think you're going to be famous?

545
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,241
And I was like,

546
00:14:39,241 --> 00:14:39,960
I don't know.

547
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,650
What do you think?

548
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,483
Oh yes,

549
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,533
I know I'm going to be,

550
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,323
now I'm going to be,

551
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,770
I've already decided I'm
going to be so famous.

552
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,633
I can't wait.

553
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,540
I can't wait to be really,

554
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,730
really famous to think this is
going to be the show for you.

555
00:14:50,731 --> 00:14:52,200
Or maybe like,

556
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,391
I don't know,

557
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:53,870
man.

558
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,500
I don't know.

559
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,660
You gotta be famous Amos from this.

560
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:57,230
Yeah.

561
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,550
I think it's already happening.

562
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:58,790
Yeah.

563
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,940
I think the arc of your friendship with
Andy was the most interesting of the

564
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:02,774
whole cast.

565
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,030
It only wish I hadn't marijuana back then.

566
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:05,550
Yeah.

567
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:05,870
Yeah.

568
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,050
I would have found him so
much more fascinating because
I had a testosterone and

569
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:12,620
adrenaline and that was just every
day was just don't kill Andi.

570
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:13,883
Don't be,

571
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,350
don't fucking kill him.

572
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:17,360
Cause he was just so out of control.

573
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:19,040
I've never met someone so out of control,

574
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:19,730
but on set.

575
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,710
Nobody enjoyed Andy more than you did.

576
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:22,620
I loved him.

577
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:22,870
Like,

578
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,470
and scenes like Joe had so much trouble
getting through scenes with Angie cause

579
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:28,060
they would laugh.

580
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,810
He would bust you up constantly.

581
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,300
I can't just say that,

582
00:15:32,301 --> 00:15:32,661
I guess,

583
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:32,991
but my,

584
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:35,170
my emotional attachment
though to news radio is that,

585
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,500
that is fucked up is he is,

586
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,370
he'll always,

587
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,170
I'll always consider him to be family.

588
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:39,840
You know,

589
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,890
like everyone from news radio,

590
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:43,070
I always considered to me
everyone from these radios,

591
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,001
you know,

592
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:45,230
his family to me.

593
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,590
Yeah.

594
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,423
You know?

595
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,090
Yeah,

596
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:47,810
no doubt.

597
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:48,111
It's,

598
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:48,381
it's,

599
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,660
it's a very unusual bond that we all have.

600
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:51,080
You know,

601
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,770
Steven road call me a while back for
some party that he was throwing and I

602
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:55,290
couldn't make it.

603
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,450
I was going out of town and I was like,

604
00:15:56,451 --> 00:15:56,781
wow,

605
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:58,370
how good is it to talk to this guy again?

606
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:58,770
Yeah.

607
00:15:58,770 --> 00:15:59,160
And I feel like,

608
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,691
I think some of this,

609
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:01,100
we won't see each other for years,

610
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:01,610
you know?

611
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,091
But it's like,

612
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:02,990
but it never feels like,

613
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,850
but whenever I see anyone from news radio,

614
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:06,080
it doesn't feel like any time is pat.

615
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,510
Ah.
