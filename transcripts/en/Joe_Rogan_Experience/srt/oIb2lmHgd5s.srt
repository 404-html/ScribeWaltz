1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
Sure,
thank you.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,390
Five,
four,

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,280
three,
two,

4
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,460
one.
Boom.

5
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:11,790
And we're live Hawaii in the house.
Good to see you.

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,280
Thanks for doing this.
Thanks for him.

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,110
What a great place to be.
A Congressperson the best.

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,340
You're in paradise.

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,250
Yeah.
It's hard to leave to go to Washington.

10
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:20,790
I'd tell you what,

11
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,623
that's one place if it wasn't for the 
storms and the fact that it's really a 

12
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:29,091
volcano as we've seen all too evident 
just recently.

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,533
Yeah.
I have a friend who goes to the big 

14
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:31,884
island every year for Thanksgiving.
He convinced me to go two years in a 

15
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:35,760
row.
It was awesome.

16
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:38,010
I loved it,
but then this year I might do.

17
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,620
It seems like it's shooting rocks into 
the sky and a half of it's on fire.

18
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,350
Yeah,
that.

19
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,030
That's been a.
that's it.

20
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:46,864
So that's my district.
My district in Hawaii covers basically 

21
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:53,560
the whole state except for the densely 
populated urban corridor of Honolulu.

22
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,713
Oh,
so you're lucky you cover everything 

23
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:57,570
except the problems bar

24
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,270
the city,
the city.

25
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:01,940
So no,
it's.

26
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:02,774
It's been tough.
It's been a tough year because of those 

27
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:06,690
folks in the district to Puno at the 
volcano.

28
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,150
We have gone through a few near misses 
with hurricanes,

29
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:14,940
some big flooding on Kawaii and now 
we've got another one that's knocking on

30
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:15,550
our door.

31
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,980
Yeah,
you guys just a,

32
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,690
what was it,
a level four just passed.

33
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,520
It was five.
They were expecting it to be kind of the

34
00:01:22,521 --> 00:01:25,700
same intensity that Puerto Rico and the 
Virgin Islands saw.

35
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,900
So we were really like encouraging 
everyone to get prepared,

36
00:01:29,901 --> 00:01:30,734
getting prepared ourselves,
like boarding up all the doors and 

37
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:33,254
windows and then,
thank God it turned into a tropical 

38
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:37,910
storm at the end and had some lot of 
rain.

39
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:38,744
We still had some flooding,
but compared to what it could have been 

40
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:41,830
very fortunate.

41
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,663
And then on top of that,
you guys had a false alarm where tax 

42
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,880
went out to everybody in the island 
saying that a nuclear missile was headed

43
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:53,770
your way.
And this was not a drill.

44
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,300
What the hell?

45
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,490
Oh my gosh,
I was in Washington when that happened.

46
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:04,120
It was a Saturday afternoon ish in dc 
time,

47
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:07,000
you know,
early morning in Hawaii and uh,

48
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,313
somebody from Hawaii,
he sent me a screen capture of that 

49
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,670
alert that went out to over a million 
cell phones across our state saying,

50
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,823
uh,
you know,

51
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,600
a ballistic missile headed towards 
Hawaii.

52
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,270
Seek cover.
This is not a good

53
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,920
drill.
Wow.

54
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,650
Yeah.
What does that feel like?

55
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,970
I mean,
until you find out that's not.

56
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:30,920
How long did it take before you found 
out that it wasn't?

57
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,340
So I immediately started thinking,
I mean,

58
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,140
so many things running through my head.
I'm thinking about my parents,

59
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,760
my husband,
my family,

60
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:39,594
everybody's in Hawaii.
Start thinking about what's going on in 

61
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:43,860
the state.
Is this real?

62
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:45,690
Is it not real?
So that was Kinda the first thing.

63
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:47,100
Like I kicked into gear like,
okay,

64
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,500
let's,
let's make sure this is legitimate.

65
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,310
I'm the actual threat from North Korea 
is a very real one.

66
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:54,144
So it could very well be.
It was not obvious that this was just a 

67
00:02:57,121 --> 00:02:57,954
mistake that people should blow off.
And that was what I think most of the 

68
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:01,684
people in the state understood as they 
started thinking through what do we do 

69
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:09,901
with the last minutes of our lives.
So I called.

70
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,010
The first person I called was our state 
adjutant general,

71
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:15,844
who's also the head of our civil defense
and the national guard and a called his 

72
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:20,260
cell phone.

73
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,660
Thank God.
He answered the phone and I said,

74
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,250
I got this message,
what's going on?

75
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:25,480
And he said,
uh,

76
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:28,150
it's a false alarm.
It was sent out as a mistake.

77
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,440
I said,
okay,

78
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,350
I'm going to blast that out.
So I got on twitter and I put that out,

79
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:32,921
just saying,
hey,

80
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,800
this is not accurate.
I forget exactly what I said,

81
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:36,634
but basically this is a false alarm.
And then just started getting on the 

82
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:41,044
phone,
making as many calls as I possibly 

83
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,750
could.
But as I was doing that,

84
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:47,920
I was getting text messages and emails 
and things from people who were freaking

85
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:49,720
out.
Um,

86
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,380
as far as Korea from Hawaii,
um,

87
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,690
it's,
it's over 4,000 miles away.

88
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,583
That's not very far for a,
for an intercontinental ballistic 

89
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:04,390
missile.
And knowing progressively,

90
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:06,760
just over the six years that I've been 
in Congress,

91
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:09,070
and this was a major issue,
um,

92
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:09,963
that I've been bringing up since I've 
been there in just raising the alarm 

93
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:16,020
bells that North Korea is increasing 
their capacity and their,

94
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,133
their ballistic missile capabilities 
that put Hawaii closer and closer than 

95
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:25,270
reach Hawaii and Alaska particularly.

96
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,510
And that's why,
you know,

97
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:29,344
and,
and after people started getting the 

98
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:31,684
word that this was a false alarm,
I started hearing from folks who just 

99
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,970
shared their stories of what they went 
through.

100
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:37,810
And you know,
on the news,

101
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:38,644
they showed the guy who was lowering his
daughter down a manhole on the side of 

102
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:43,150
the street,
his little girl.

103
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,930
Oh God.
I heard from another guy who said that,

104
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,333
you know,
I had one kid in town in Honolulu and 

105
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:54,460
another kid and why and I over an hour 
drive.

106
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,730
And he literally sat there thinking,
how am I going to choose which child I'm

107
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:02,590
going to go and spend the last minutes 
of my life with?

108
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,230
Because you're either driving in one 
direction or the other.

109
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,810
There are so many,
so many stories of what happen,

110
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,920
guy pushed,
clicked on the wrong,

111
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,933
uh,
on the wrong alert message on his 

112
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:20,290
computer screen.
That's ultimately what happened.

113
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,300
Uh,
the one that said,

114
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,193
this is a drill.
Did he have like no glasses on or 

115
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:27,334
something or was it just,
there's so many theories and his story 

116
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:31,924
has changed a few times and of course 
there's the subject of major 

117
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:37,180
investigations and then after awhile he 
got fired.

118
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:38,014
He's actually swings and he was 
wrongfully terminated and almost stuff 

119
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:41,644
going on.
And

120
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,200
if ever there was something you could be
fired for,

121
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,620
how could you be wrongfully terminated 
for that mistake?

122
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,513
That's my question.
To understand the magnitude of your 

123
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:50,920
decision.
I mean,

124
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,780
that is a giant fuck up.
Yeah.

125
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:53,883
Oh my God.

126
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,760
But it,
it,

127
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,180
you know,
I think it,

128
00:05:56,181 --> 00:05:59,090
um,
it really woke people up.

129
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,170
There were clear vulnerabilities in our 
state alert system that would even allow

130
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:04,004
this,
allow one person to have that power to 

131
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:09,830
do that is not,
it's obviously not good.

132
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,023
And so there,
there are things that we're working to 

133
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,970
just to strengthen our civil defense 
alert system,

134
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:17,510
but also just to bring attention to 
North Korea and,

135
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,403
and make it so that people aren't living
under this threat of possibility that 

136
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:24,074
that could be a real thing and that 
alarm could come through your phone and 

137
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:28,244
know that you now have around 18 minutes
to find good cover or say our final 

138
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:34,630
goodbyes.

139
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,463
Well,
it's so scary because it's such an 

140
00:06:36,281 --> 00:06:37,114
erratic and dangerous regime.
I mean when you see what that guy is 

141
00:06:41,141 --> 00:06:43,720
already done and the people he's 
executed,

142
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:45,880
including family members.
Yeah.

143
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,893
I mean he's a quite a maniac and a 
legitimate dictator in the old world 

144
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:54,880
kind of sense.
It's very strange that he's still.

145
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,073
I mean you think in the age that we live
in that would be very difficult to 

146
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:00,874
control the entire country the way that 
they've controlled North Korea for so 

147
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:04,834
long.
Yeah.

148
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,970
Since the Korean War.
But yeah,

149
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:07,990
they still can do it

150
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:13,310
that they are.
And I think that while it may be easy to

151
00:07:13,831 --> 00:07:14,664
write him off as a maniac,
there has also been a very consistent 

152
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:20,711
there.
There,

153
00:07:20,711 --> 00:07:21,544
there has been a consistency throughout 
the different regimes of the Kim family 

154
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,533
as they've developed this nuclear,
a nuclear missile capability in that 

155
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,690
they are doing it to protect themselves 
against regime change,

156
00:07:36,691 --> 00:07:40,020
war essentially.
And they have said it directly.

157
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,040
Um,
uh,

158
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,641
you know,
our,

159
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:42,474
our US foreign policy experts point that
out that this is the reason why they're 

160
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:48,870
developing this capability because they 
have seen how,

161
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,240
if you look at Libya,
for example,

162
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,820
when Gaddafi was looking at,
you know,

163
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:56,910
building and acquiring nuclear weapons,
um,

164
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,540
he was doing so also as you know,
to protect himself and his regime.

165
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,280
And then he made a deal with the United 
States saying,

166
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,114
okay,
give up your nuclear weapons a program 

167
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,010
and we're not going to,
you know,

168
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,600
don't worry about it.
We're not going to touch you.

169
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:11,450
And then of course we know what 
happened.

170
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,700
The U S led this regime change war 
toppled,

171
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:16,620
Gadhafi and,
and North Korea says,

172
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:20,760
okay,
so that's what you do when you have,

173
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,813
you know,
a leader of a country without nuclear 

174
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:25,110
weapons to protect themselves.

175
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,853
Well,
it's also the consequences of that 

176
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:29,554
regime change is a failed state and it's
more terrifying than even when Gaddafi 

177
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:36,550
was controlling.
I mean,

178
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:37,950
I'm sure you've seen the,
uh,

179
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:41,320
the slave trade videos from their fine.
It's insane.

180
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,390
It is horrifying.
You're watching youtube.

181
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:43,971
Yeah.
Right,

182
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:44,070
right.

183
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,990
And in our lifetime and that,
this,

184
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,030
this,
um,

185
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,400
this failed state has happened as a 
direct result of our policy.

186
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:52,234
There are failed continuation of these 
regime change wars that we carry out 

187
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,340
different parts of the world.

188
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,750
Right?
It's almost like we don't learn from our

189
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:03,460
mistakes and I don't know what the 
proper solution is.

190
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:04,294
I mean,
do you keep someone like Saddam Hussein 

191
00:09:06,161 --> 00:09:06,994
or someone like Walmart Kadafi,
do you keep them in power and let them 

192
00:09:09,521 --> 00:09:14,521
still be horrific dictators in evil 
maniacs or do you step in and cause more

193
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:16,510
damage?
I mean,

194
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,450
it's almost a lose lose situation.

195
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:20,791
It,
it's,

196
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,470
yeah,
it's not a good situation,

197
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:27,471
but it's where we as the United States 
need to be pragmatic about the situation

198
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:31,590
and the fact that we live in the world 
that exists,

199
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,550
not some kind of idealistic world that 
is a fantasy.

200
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,030
And then think about how,
um,

201
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:44,150
counterproductive our acting as the 
world's police has been,

202
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,320
has proven to be,
in example,

203
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:48,330
after example after example.
So yes,

204
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:51,660
there are bad people in the world who do
horrifying things,

205
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,183
but

206
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,940
is it really in our place to go in and 
take action and say,

207
00:09:57,941 --> 00:09:58,774
okay,
we're going to remove this person and 

208
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:00,874
then we're going to put this person in 
and this is how you're going to govern 

209
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:03,580
this country.
And,

210
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:04,683
and really acting,
acting as the world's police and 

211
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:08,170
therefore,
and then as a result,

212
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:11,050
as we've seen in Iraq and Libya and now 
in Syria,

213
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,180
the people in those countries are far 
worse off than they were before.

214
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,943
We have an.
And it's counterproductive for our 

215
00:10:19,211 --> 00:10:23,110
interests as well because we have al 
Qaeda,

216
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,213
Isis and other terrorist groups who have
been strengthened directly as a result 

217
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:29,890
of our policies in these countries.

218
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,470
When you talk to people in the 
intelligence community,

219
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,080
what,
what did they think,

220
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,540
I mean either off the record or on the 
record,

221
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,600
what did they think is the solution for 
situations like that?

222
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:48,070
Many of them are hesitant to share their
own opinion because,

223
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:50,020
especially in the intelligence 
community,

224
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,303
um,
their job is to report on what they're 

225
00:10:54,401 --> 00:10:55,710
hearing,
what they're gathering,

226
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,180
the Intel that they're bringing in and 
so on and so forth.

227
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,730
But you know what,
when you,

228
00:11:00,731 --> 00:11:03,520
when you talk with folks who operate in 
that space,

229
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,833
um,
the ones who are honest and not trying 

230
00:11:08,621 --> 00:11:13,330
to further specific agenda or cover 
somebody else's bad decisions,

231
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,523
um,
there is a recognition of how our 

232
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:19,810
policies of the past decades have 
failed.

233
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,760
People in those countries and us,

234
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:23,823
they failed.
But have they failed as bad or equally 

235
00:11:28,631 --> 00:11:32,020
bad as if we did,
if we did nothing like worse,

236
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,160
worse for sure.
We,

237
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,810
yes,
yes,

238
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,293
mmm.

239
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,383
Worse for the people in those countries.
Worse for the people in those countries 

240
00:11:39,851 --> 00:11:40,720
as well as,
as,

241
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,823
as we should be thinking about before we
take any of these actions is how does 

242
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:48,460
this best serve the interest of our 
people in this country and these actions

243
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:51,550
have been counter to those best 
interests.

244
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,320
And so your question about,
so why do we keep doing this?

245
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,913
Um,
I think there are a lot of different 

246
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:01,600
things that go into that and to drive 
that,

247
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,970
you know,
you have the military industrial complex

248
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,250
that benefits and makes a lot of money 
off of our being in a,

249
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,163
in a perpetual state of war.
You have a lot of other countries like 

250
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,440
Saudi Arabia,
for example,

251
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:17,170
who dump a lot of money into the United 
States,

252
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,370
uh,
and,

253
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,480
and,
um,

254
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,823
kind of try to use our US military as 
they're forced to go in and do certain 

255
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:28,150
things in the Middle East that's more 
beneficial to Saudi Arabia.

256
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,673
Uh,
we see this happening in Yemen right 

257
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,620
now.
Yet another example,

258
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,933
interventionist war jumping in there.
We're a supporting Saudi Arabia and 

259
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:39,844
their coalition in this war that's 
created the worst humanitarian disaster 

260
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:47,020
in the world.
They just bombed a school bus and killed

261
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:47,854
40 kids a couple of weeks ago,
and Yemen Yemeni civilians bombed 

262
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:55,030
weddings in Yemen and yet,
uh,

263
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,030
our US government is not saying,
hey,

264
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,351
we're,
we're gonna,

265
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:01,290
stop and Yank all of our support for 
Saturday with their.

266
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,470
They're continuing to do it.

267
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:08,880
But you're a veteran as a veteran,
do you mean you,

268
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,300
you've served our country,
you've,

269
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,280
you've put yourself in harm's way,
you,

270
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,193
you were a part of the military,
but there's so many people that are 

271
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,130
making these decisions that have not 
done that.

272
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,500
Yeah.
Do you think that's part of the problem?

273
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,150
Yes,
and that was,

274
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,900
that was one of the main reasons that I 
ran for Congress in the first place.

275
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,410
Having come back from,
uh,

276
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,400
my,
my own deployments to the Middle East at

277
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:33,234
the Hawaii Army National Guard,
I'm experiencing and seeing firsthand 

278
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,830
the cost of war both on our troops,
on our friends who didn't make that trip

279
00:13:45,031 --> 00:13:45,864
home with us as well as on the people,
the people in these countries where we 

280
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,784
were.
And I came back and saw just the 

281
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:56,724
cavalier attitude that a lot of 
politicians take to making these 

282
00:14:00,391 --> 00:14:01,230
decisions.
And,

283
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:02,064
and I,
I worked in a medical unit and my 

284
00:14:03,211 --> 00:14:04,044
deployment to Iraq,
we were in a base about 40 miles north 

285
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:11,160
of Baghdad.
And um,

286
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,283
our base where we were was,
was nicknamed a mortar Rita Ville 

287
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:20,670
because of the constant,
almost daily mortar attacks.

288
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,313
And everyday part of my job was to go 
through a list of all of the American 

289
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,660
injuries and casualties that had 
happened the day before to try to see if

290
00:14:33,661 --> 00:14:38,661
there were any of our close to 3000 
Hawaii soldiers who had been hurt and to

291
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:41,604
then make sure that they were getting 
the care they needed either in country 

292
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,540
or get them evacuated as quickly as 
possible.

293
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,373
And just going through,
going through that list name by name 

294
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:52,220
every day.
Um,

295
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,660
whether there were people on there who I
knew personally or you know,

296
00:14:56,661 --> 00:15:01,661
people who I would never meet.
And knowing about the family members and

297
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,710
loved ones,
moms,

298
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:08,711
dads,
kids at home who were stressed out every

299
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:09,944
day,
fearing getting that phone call that 

300
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:14,540
their loved one that had been hurt or 
worse,

301
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,500
killed in action.
And I wondered then,

302
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,650
you know,
how many of these politicians who,

303
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,543
who make these votes and who make these 
decisions actually think about this or 

304
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,140
who lose sleep on this,

305
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,893
do you think a solution to that would be
mandatory military service for people 

306
00:15:32,651 --> 00:15:35,380
who are in those positions?
I don't.

307
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,540
You don't know.
What do you think?

308
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,700
Because as a soldier,
I don't know.

309
00:15:38,701 --> 00:15:41,460
I don't want somebody in my foxhole 
doesn't want to be there.

310
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,620
First of all.
I think it's,

311
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,643
you know,
having an all volunteer force which we 

312
00:15:44,671 --> 00:15:46,000
have,
um,

313
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:51,001
is a positive thing.
I think that the American people need to

314
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,600
impress upon their leaders,
um,

315
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:59,560
the importance of taking these decisions
very seriously.

316
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:00,394
That if they want to represent and make,
represent the American people and make 

317
00:16:04,091 --> 00:16:06,610
these decisions for our troops and for 
our country,

318
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:11,230
they need to understand who pays that 
price for the cost of war.

319
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,173
And yes,
it is every single one of our service 

320
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:15,334
members,
both those who paid the ultimate price 

321
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:22,540
as well as those who come home with both
visible and invisible wounds,

322
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,753
um,
and who will continue paying that price 

323
00:16:25,091 --> 00:16:27,910
for a very long time to come,
but also

324
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,043
every one of our communities filled with
people who may not have worn the 

325
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:33,134
uniform,
but who've had trillions of dollars 

326
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:35,954
taken out of their wallet to pay for 
these counterproductive 

327
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:42,050
interventionists.
Wars as we in Hawaii,

328
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:42,884
for example,
struggle to put air conditioners in 

329
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:45,194
schools where kids are trying to study 
in over 100 degree heat as we deal with 

330
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,280
massive infrastructure problems.
People in Michigan,

331
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:53,114
they just shut down the water system in 
a bunch of schools in Detroit because 

332
00:16:56,421 --> 00:17:00,110
they have lead poisoning the water for 
the kids.

333
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:02,750
So the kids are not able to use the 
water fountains at school.

334
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,560
So we have major infrastructure,
major cha challenges and issues.

335
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:07,933
And so making sure that leaders are held
accountable for the decisions that 

336
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:13,550
they're making is ultimately what needs 
to happen.

337
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,160
One of the things I learned about you in
one of the things I've liked about a lot

338
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,760
of your interviews is you have an 
obvious genuine person,

339
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,650
like if you're not genuine,
I'd be very shocked.

340
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,323
That's very rare,
so when you're talking about these 

341
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:27,230
politicians and having these people 
being held accountable,

342
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,993
it's a real problem,
but one of the problems with politics 

343
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,533
and one of the problems with public 
speaking and being charismatic is a lot 

344
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,124
of these people are just really good at 
being full of shit and because they're 

345
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:42,800
really good at being full of shit.
A lot of slack,

346
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:44,570
jawed dumb dumbs out there,
buy into it,

347
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:45,560
hook,
line and sinker,

348
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,543
wave that flag and kiss those babies and
they vote these dummies office and this 

349
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:51,690
happens time and time again.
Yeah,

350
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,643
so saying you need these people need to 
be aware of the consequences are that 

351
00:17:57,841 --> 00:17:59,010
need to be held accountable.

352
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,230
I firmly believe there's more associate 
and we really think I really do.

353
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,930
I think if you look at the general 
consensus is something like,

354
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,720
what is it one out of 100 or something 
like that.

355
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,000
What do they think it is?
Maybe more.

356
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,530
I think it might be 10 percent.
I think there's a lot of people that get

357
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:17,364
through life doing things and getting 
away with things and not doing things 

358
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:26,160
that are going to cause them either 
danger or social consequences,

359
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,263
but they,
but they managed to get through life 

360
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,620
with a song and a dance,
but they're not genuine.

361
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:32,763
I think this is a giant problem with 
people that want to be in a position of 

362
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:37,960
power in the first place.
Yes.

363
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:38,843
Like why would they,
why does a guy like Donald Trump wants 

364
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:44,100
to be the fucking president when you 
have billions of dollars in the bank?

365
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:45,840
Like what are you doing?
Why are you doing that?

366
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,520
There's a weird motivation that a lot of
these people have and that motivation is

367
00:18:50,521 --> 00:18:52,860
to be the uber they know,
to be the king,

368
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,840
to be the top of the heap,
to be the queen,

369
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:56,430
whatever it is.
Um,

370
00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:59,160
I don't know how you change that in 
those people.

371
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:02,960
I don't think making them aware of the 
consequences of their decisions is going

372
00:19:02,961 --> 00:19:03,794
to work.
It's just the type of people who they 

373
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:08,040
are in the first place.

374
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,260
I don't.
Yeah.

375
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,850
Yeah.
You think you're not wrong.

376
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:12,684
However,
I've just seen over the last few years 

377
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,403
the level of awareness amongst people 
amongst voters has been increasing as 

378
00:19:24,961 --> 00:19:25,794
there are more and more kind of non 
mainstream media outlets that are 

379
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:32,550
shining light on these kinds of issues.
And

380
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,513
when you say non mainstream seating,
do you think that mainstream have been 

381
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:37,774
holding back?

382
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,240
I think that especially,
um,

383
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,420
I think that you only get a certain 
narrative,

384
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,980
right?
And it depends on,

385
00:19:44,981 --> 00:19:47,680
it changes based on what channel you 
flick to or whatever

386
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,200
because if you vary in that narrative 
then you get less access.

387
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,240
Uh,
yeah,

388
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:54,230
I guess you could say that.

389
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,093
So you get less access to the people 
that you want to have on those shows 

390
00:19:57,411 --> 00:19:59,010
because that's how you get your ratings 
in the first place.

391
00:19:59,011 --> 00:19:59,430
Yeah.

392
00:19:59,430 --> 00:19:59,941
Yeah.
I mean,

393
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:01,590
and that's,
that's the problem with these,

394
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,453
with a lot of these news channels is it 
is driven by ratings and if you're 

395
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:10,050
bringing in different viewpoints and 
different perspectives,

396
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,030
um,
I dunno,

397
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,710
maybe it affects their ratings.
I don't know,

398
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:17,610
I don't pay too much attention to that,
but I do know that when you look at,

399
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,300
uh,
you know,

400
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,250
guys like Jimmy Dore for example,
yes,

401
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,323
you know,
Jimmy Dore talks about a lot of things 

402
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,860
that you'll never hear if you flick on 
the TV on the,

403
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,820
on the cable news channels and has very 
interesting conversations and again,

404
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:30,654
bringing facts and different things to 
life that people don't otherwise feel 

405
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:35,550
like they have access to.

406
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:36,783
Well,
there's way more of that today than 

407
00:20:37,811 --> 00:20:38,644
there ever has been.

408
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,480
That's where I see there's opportunity 
and because the more people are learning

409
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:43,350
like,
holy crap,

410
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,213
this is what you're doing.
This is the consequences of those 

411
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:47,514
decisions.
There's a ton of votes that happened 

412
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,553
every single day in Congress that most 
people don't know about unless you're 

413
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:56,710
really following it closely yourself.
Just that,

414
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:59,710
that in itself of itself is a job that,
that,

415
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,820
you know,
CNN,

416
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:02,290
MSNBC,
Fox News,

417
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,453
they're not covering a.
So really a lot of kind of these 

418
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:11,050
alternative sites and voices are coming 
through that are helping to,

419
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:12,940
um,
helping to inform and educate people.

420
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,523
Yeah.
The,

421
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,543
the,
the idea of trying to educate 

422
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,120
politicians on the consequences and what
that,

423
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:23,930
what that really means and this,
the,

424
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,140
the cavalier attitude that you were 
talking about,

425
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:28,810
like what's a worst example that like 
when you,

426
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:33,820
when you were talking about cavalier 
behavior by these people that make these

427
00:21:33,881 --> 00:21:35,980
decisions,
like what kinds of things have you seen?

428
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,773
Um,
I'll speak to something that happened 

429
00:21:40,371 --> 00:21:41,204
most recently.
I think there are probably a number of 

430
00:21:42,171 --> 00:21:46,010
examples,
but I'm just a couple of months ago.

431
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,910
And the big defense authorization bill 
that,

432
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,030
that is kind of one of the,
the,

433
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:56,410
the only must pass pieces of legislation
in Congress every year there was a three

434
00:21:57,311 --> 00:21:58,144
page provision that was kind of put in 
there without really any debate in the 

435
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:02,084
committee or anything like that that 
would essentially authorize the United 

436
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,563
States to go to war with Iran.
Now you would think something like that 

437
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,510
with that magnitude would be kind of a 
big deal.

438
00:22:14,511 --> 00:22:15,344
You would want to have hearings,
you would want to have be a question on 

439
00:22:17,841 --> 00:22:19,820
strategy,
objectives costs,

440
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:22,550
like all of these different things that 
didn't happen.

441
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,253
So when this bill came to the floor of 
the house where all 435 members of 

442
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:30,050
Congress have the ability to vote yes or
no,

443
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:35,810
I just put in an amendment that would 
have deleted those three pages from this

444
00:22:35,811 --> 00:22:37,670
big thousands page bill.

445
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,800
Um,
and,

446
00:22:39,801 --> 00:22:44,801
and basically those provisions said that
Congress is authorizing the secretary of

447
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:48,284
state and the secretary of defense to 
create and implement a strategy to 

448
00:22:53,691 --> 00:22:57,410
counter Iran,
not just come and,

449
00:22:57,411 --> 00:22:58,244
hey,
bring us your strategy and let us talk 

450
00:22:59,571 --> 00:23:01,850
about it and see whether or not we agree
and improve.

451
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,043
It was giving the power to the secretary
of state and secretary of defense to 

452
00:23:07,581 --> 00:23:11,510
create and implement a strategy to 
counter Iran.

453
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,063
Extremely dangerous and a blank check to
essentially start a brand new war that 

454
00:23:17,391 --> 00:23:18,224
currently has not been declared.
I introduced this amendment and if you 

455
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:25,010
want to take a guess on how many people 
voted for it,

456
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,510
how many 60?

457
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,520
60.
Why wouldn't they?

458
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,023
Why would they want that blank check?
There are some people who legitimately 

459
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:39,284
do want to do,
want us to go to war with Iran or who 

460
00:23:41,301 --> 00:23:42,920
are those people?
Um,

461
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,830
you don't have to name names there,
there is,

462
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:45,561
uh,
there are,

463
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:49,280
I would say it's a bipartisan feeling.
And why do they want that?

464
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,310
Because Iran,
uh,

465
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,193
they,
they feel that Iran is a threat to both 

466
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:58,070
the United States and Israel and Iran is
and has been for a long time.

467
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:03,100
They feel I'm a menace,
I guess essentially,

468
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,003
and our enemy,
even though Congress has not declared 

469
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:10,070
war,
uh,

470
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,540
even though,
you know,

471
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:12,374
we,
our country just signed a nuclear deal 

472
00:24:14,301 --> 00:24:16,940
to make it so that they can't build a 
nuclear weapon.

473
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,710
Um,
it's,

474
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:19,544
it's,
uh,

475
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,390
it,
it gets to a point where it seems like a

476
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,810
hysteria,
but again,

477
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:27,470
it's not based on an actual thinking 
through tactically and strategically and

478
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:31,640
responsibly what we're actually doing 
and what our policy is.

479
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,120
Are you one of the younger people in 
Congress?

480
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,323
Yeah.
You could say that there's a handful of 

481
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:42,770
us who are under 40,
not many small handful in.

482
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:44,803
Is that,

483
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,751
I mean,
you're,

484
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:49,130
you're a person who would you like 30,
37.

485
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,300
You,
you're not allowed to ask ladies.

486
00:24:51,301 --> 00:24:54,720
Usually your congresswoman politicians 
are an exception.

487
00:24:54,721 --> 00:24:57,290
I guess everything has to be on the 
table with,

488
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,160
we have to be a certain age to run for 
office,

489
00:24:59,161 --> 00:24:59,850
so,
you know,

490
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,683
well,
how would you have to be to be 

491
00:25:00,901 --> 00:25:04,080
president?
I'm 35 so you can get in there.

492
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,280
Yeah,
we thought about it.

493
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,470
Ah,
you know,

494
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,310
a lot of,
you know,

495
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,470
a lot of people have been,

496
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,920
especially with everything that's going 
on,

497
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:15,200
I've been kind of urging me to,
um,

498
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,170
to consider it,
you know,

499
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:18,891
um,
you know,

500
00:25:18,891 --> 00:25:19,724
I'm folk,
I'm focused on home and focused on 

501
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:21,524
Hawaii.
I'm want to do my very best to be able 

502
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:26,470
to serve them in our country.
And um,

503
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,960
yeah.
This seems like it's too much work too.

504
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,330
It's a lot.

505
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,380
It seems like too much.
It's a lot at age.

506
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,223
Is the shit out of those,
those more pictures are always 

507
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,483
interesting.
George Bush was one of the weirdest 

508
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:41,780
ones.
Whoa.

509
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,110
And Obama.
Obama was a rough one too.

510
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

511
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,270
I mean,
it just does.

512
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,753
There's no getting away from that.
And if it doesn't then they should 

513
00:25:49,271 --> 00:25:51,400
probably,
probably not doing your job.

514
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:56,580
Probably a monster somewhere.
Yeah.

515
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,920
I'm mean,
it's,

516
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:58,710
um,

517
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,020
you're in a crazy business,
but I think to that,

518
00:26:01,021 --> 00:26:02,370
to that point,
just talking about,

519
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,940
um,
how few younger members of Congress,

520
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:08,880
there are a.
One of the things I did when I first got

521
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:09,714
elected,
I started something called the future 

522
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:15,410
caucus and it was a bipartisan kind of 
millennial focused caucus saying that we

523
00:26:15,961 --> 00:26:18,110
as a generation,
um,

524
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:23,390
recognize the need to work together to 
drop all the partisan hyperpartisan crap

525
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,043
that is tearing this country apart and 
focus on solutions and actually solving 

526
00:26:28,591 --> 00:26:30,300
problems.
And so,

527
00:26:30,301 --> 00:26:31,134
you know,
different people have come and gone in 

528
00:26:31,741 --> 00:26:33,690
Congress.
But I think what's,

529
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:39,340
what's exciting now is that there is a 
lot more energy,

530
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,403
interest and activity.
I think from young people in this who 

531
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,340
may fall in different places on 
ideological spectrum of politics.

532
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:49,920
But recognize that,
you know,

533
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,030
there's no reason why I should give my 
voice to someone from another generation

534
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:58,680
who has no idea what our challenges are 
or the challenges that we will face from

535
00:26:58,681 --> 00:27:00,570
the decisions they made in left behind.

536
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:04,420
When I see someone like jeff sessions 
and then I see someone like you.

537
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,870
Obviously you're different.
You know,

538
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,940
different realms of the ideological 
spectrum,

539
00:27:09,941 --> 00:27:10,774
but there's a big difference between 
someone who formed their view of the 

540
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:20,101
world while the Internet was active and 
that's you versus this crazy old asshole

541
00:27:22,961 --> 00:27:25,230
who thinks that people smoke marijuana 
are bad people.

542
00:27:25,231 --> 00:27:26,290
I mean he.
There's a.

543
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,110
it's a weird thing when you see some of 
these old guard,

544
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,510
they are,
they're relic of the past,

545
00:27:31,511 --> 00:27:35,230
but yet they're still in a position of 
power and control and they're.

546
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:40,580
They're making these decisions based on 
this old world that really doesn't exist

547
00:27:40,841 --> 00:27:41,674
anymore.
Yeah,

548
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:45,940
and there's so many different ways that 
that actually has a very real impact and

549
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,163
I think the.
Some of the hearings that we've seen 

550
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:53,800
most recently dealing with facebook and 
twitter and Google are a perfect example

551
00:27:53,801 --> 00:27:57,610
where you have people asking questions 
and it becomes very obvious quickly.

552
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,500
Yes.
They don't like.

553
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,380
They don't know how to log into 
facebook.

554
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:07,780
I've never sent a tweet in their lives.
Some of these people are very proud that

555
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,350
they either don't have a cell phone or 
they still have a flip phone,

556
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,330
which is fine.
If that's your personal decision,

557
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,193
that's fine,
but if you're the the regulatory body 

558
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,873
that should be exercising oversight over
how technology is rapidly changing the 

559
00:28:22,151 --> 00:28:23,620
world that we live in,
right?

560
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,430
You got to know something about it or be
surround yourself with people who do

561
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,083
well,
especially when it pertains to selling 

562
00:28:31,271 --> 00:28:36,271
people's privacy or using people's data 
to influence elections and using.

563
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,683
You know,
the stuff that's been happening with 

564
00:28:40,391 --> 00:28:45,190
facebook is even more strange because I 
don't know how you stop.

565
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,533
Like there was a fantastic NPR podcast 
about these Russian troll farms about 

566
00:28:52,091 --> 00:28:55,720
their jobs.
People show up for work and their job is

567
00:28:55,721 --> 00:29:00,721
to spread misinformation and propaganda.
You know about whatever the subject is,

568
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,130
whatever ideological point they're 
trying to push through,

569
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,000
but they're trying to influence the way 
people look at things in their targeting

570
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:10,834
people's comments sections and news 
feeds and twitter feeds and they're 

571
00:29:14,381 --> 00:29:15,214
trying to do something that injects 
ideas into people's minds and sways 

572
00:29:21,521 --> 00:29:23,230
their perception and their point of 
view.

573
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:27,790
And it's very strange when you think 
that a foreign country is doing this and

574
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:30,640
that people from a foreign country that 
this is actually a job,

575
00:29:30,641 --> 00:29:31,474
so it must have,
there must be some sort of a reason for 

576
00:29:33,191 --> 00:29:33,760
this.

577
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,770
And then when you see those people that 
are questioning,

578
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,080
uh,
what's his name?

579
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,333
Facebook.
Uh,

580
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,800
Dr Berg.
Jeff Zuckerberg.

581
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,830
Not Jeff Soccer Birth Mark Sternberg,
Jeff Zuckerberg,

582
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,450
the guy runs NBC.
CBS.

583
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,650
Right?
But at NBC.

584
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,543
No.
Is it?

585
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,780
Yeah,
I think it's NBC,

586
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,500
you know,
Jeff Soccer,

587
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,750
soccer,
soccer.

588
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,710
There you go.
Anyone with the name of CSEC?

589
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,860
What a strange name.
But Zuckerberg's,

590
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:02,310
you know,
he was so guarded in that as well that,

591
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:02,711
um,
um,

592
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:03,790
I,
I almost wanted to go,

593
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:04,510
hey,
stop.

594
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:07,060
This is not you man.
Where's the real you?

595
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,260
Yeah.
This is weird.

596
00:30:08,261 --> 00:30:11,950
The way you're sipping water and you're 
just the way you're talking to people.

597
00:30:11,951 --> 00:30:13,340
So odd.
Yeah.

598
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,160
These,
the formality of it all.

599
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,320
Yeah.
Some of my friends on that committee who

600
00:30:17,321 --> 00:30:18,154
actually are under 40 years old,
who were members of Congress and who 

601
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,230
prepared and,
and you know,

602
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:25,990
went in and were asking some tough 
questions.

603
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,913
Um,
were very frustrated just because they 

604
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:32,320
didn't feel like they were getting,
they were actually getting,

605
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:33,850
um,
many answers,

606
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,200
first of all,
a lot of,

607
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,650
a lot of kind of legally speaking in 
circles and that kind of thing.

608
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:41,740
And um,
I think when you're,

609
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:44,410
when you're talking about an and there's
so many,

610
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,363
I don't know,
I've kind of going in a few different 

611
00:30:46,181 --> 00:30:49,600
directions here with,
with these social media giants,

612
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,280
how they're being misused,
um,

613
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,580
to further certain agendas in different 
ways.

614
00:30:54,581 --> 00:30:59,110
But when you're talking about like these
Russian troll farms that you're,

615
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,833
um,
that you mentioned what is missing from 

616
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,223
all of the news coverage around this and
all of the outrage about how this 

617
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,910
foreign country is trying to influence 
our elections,

618
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,970
which is wrong and which the American 
people need to be aware of.

619
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,810
Where this information is coming from is
the fact that we.

620
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,490
And you're saying why,
why does somebody do that?

621
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:23,560
Well,
because this country does want to,

622
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,530
um,
influence who were electing,

623
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:27,260
right?
Yeah.

624
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,093
We'd rather work with this person.
We know that person's not going to be 

625
00:31:29,611 --> 00:31:30,444
nice to us.
The United States has been doing this 

626
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:34,090
for a very long time.
Sure.

627
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,900
In countries around the world,
both overtly and covertly through,

628
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,450
through these kinds of information 
campaigns.

629
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,150
Not,
not even counting,

630
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:47,350
like the outright regime change wars.
We're going to physically take you out.

631
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,980
And um,
I think it is.

632
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:52,523
I'm very hypocritical for us to be 
discussing this issue as a country 

633
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,280
without actually being honest about how 
this goes both ways.

634
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:03,244
So yes,
we need to stop these other foreign 

635
00:32:05,171 --> 00:32:07,090
countries and Russia is not the only 
one.

636
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:07,924
There are others from a trying to 
influence the American people in our 

637
00:32:11,381 --> 00:32:12,214
elections.
We also need to stop doing the same 

638
00:32:13,811 --> 00:32:14,860
thing in other countries

639
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,400
without doubt.
Um,

640
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,760
but there's also the question is what is
Russia trying to achieve?

641
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,410
Like,
oh,

642
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,243
why do they want someone like Donald 
Trump in office versus someone like 

643
00:32:27,331 --> 00:32:28,164
Hillary Clinton,
like what is to be gained and how much 

644
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,181
you know.
I mean,

645
00:32:33,181 --> 00:32:34,830
how much do they benefit from that?
Yeah.

646
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,693
This is what's really one of the big 
questions it's going on right now with 

647
00:32:38,761 --> 00:32:39,594
all the Russian hearings and the Mueller
investigation and trying to get to the 

648
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:45,140
bottom of all this and why they did what
they did and what they did,

649
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,653
and there's many people that are blowing
this off and they don't think that it's 

650
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:50,340
important and you know,
the,

651
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,250
the president's claiming it's a witch 
hunt,

652
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,130
but it's very odd that we're having this
conversation in the first place.

653
00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:58,460
It's never existed before in any single 
presidential election.

654
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,543
There was never been talk of us or any 
politician that's running for president 

655
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:08,030
being influenced by a foreign superpower
before today.

656
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,310
It's just amazing that it took until 
2016 before this became a real issue.

657
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,020
That's true.
That's true.

658
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,213
Well,
there's talk about Hillary and uranium 

659
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:19,520
and all kinds of other different issues 
and you know,

660
00:33:19,521 --> 00:33:20,354
I mean,
I'm,

661
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,820
I'm not a giant Hillary Clinton fan and 
one of the reasons why I'm not as.

662
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,700
I just,
I think she's a politician,

663
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:26,803
you know,
and I don't think she's a genuine 

664
00:33:28,371 --> 00:33:29,300
person.
I just don't.

665
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,253
I think you get to a,
a level of lying and the way they 

666
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,473
conduct themselves in the way they've 
been doing it for so long that they 

667
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:40,880
don't even think it's a bad thing.
It's just a thing you do.

668
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,900
But one of the weirder ones that I ever 
saw from her was after the Libya,

669
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,200
after Kadafi was killed,
where she was not on the record,

670
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:52,430
but she was still being recorded there 
talking to her.

671
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:55,820
You know what I'm talking about where 
she said we came,

672
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,510
we saw was we came,
we saw,

673
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,710
we saw him.
He died.

674
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,573
What was the,
I don't know,

675
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,473
the.
Yeah,

676
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,243
we came,
we saw and he's dead or something and 

677
00:34:05,781 --> 00:34:08,960
she was laughing,
like literally laughing.

678
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,700
But this is,
this is exactly what I'm talking about,

679
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:16,830
about that cavalier attitude within 
Washington.

680
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,703
And for me that was,
that was really the main reason why in 

681
00:34:20,731 --> 00:34:24,330
2016 I was a vice chair of the 
Democratic National Party.

682
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,760
Um,
as an officer of the party,

683
00:34:26,761 --> 00:34:29,610
you're supposed to stay neutral in these
democratic primaries.

684
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:34,350
But it got to a point where I felt I 
stepped down from that position,

685
00:34:34,351 --> 00:34:37,560
resigned as vice chair to endorse Bernie
Sanders,

686
00:34:37,561 --> 00:34:38,394
largely because of the huge difference 
in their world views with Hillary 

687
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:49,290
Clinton's very hawkish interventionist,
foreign policy.

688
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:51,490
And track record.
Libya is,

689
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,890
is a very prominent in recent example,
Iraq is another.

690
00:34:55,891 --> 00:34:59,130
And Bernie Sanders,
who generally takes some more um,

691
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:03,180
non interventionist worldview a that was
an issue,

692
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:04,014
again,
like as you're talking to that people 

693
00:35:04,351 --> 00:35:06,090
weren't really raising the differences,
are saying,

694
00:35:06,091 --> 00:35:07,350
oh,
she was secretary of state.

695
00:35:07,351 --> 00:35:08,184
So she's great on foreign policy,
but not actually looking at what is the 

696
00:35:10,381 --> 00:35:11,214
actual policy.
Right and what kind of judgment would 

697
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,173
either of these individuals have when 
they're serving in that most important 

698
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:22,020
job of commander in chief.
And that was,

699
00:35:22,021 --> 00:35:22,854
that was,
uh,

700
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,973
a very key difference.
And that was something I talked about a 

701
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:28,080
lot as I campaigned with Bernie around 
the country.

702
00:35:28,081 --> 00:35:28,914
And,
and that was something that I saw and 

703
00:35:29,971 --> 00:35:33,360
heard from people in big cities,
small towns,

704
00:35:33,361 --> 00:35:34,290
Midwest,
north,

705
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:34,891
south,
east,

706
00:35:34,891 --> 00:35:37,920
west,
people who appreciated.

707
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,760
I'm just being told the truth.

708
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,260
Well,
there was also the,

709
00:35:44,261 --> 00:35:45,094
um,
the speeches that you gave where she 

710
00:35:47,501 --> 00:35:52,180
wouldn't give up the transcripts for 
those gigantic paid speeches she gave in

711
00:35:52,181 --> 00:35:53,590
front of bankers street.
Yeah.

712
00:35:53,591 --> 00:35:56,680
Which is crazy that that's legal.
I mean,

713
00:35:56,681 --> 00:35:57,940
that is essentially.
Look,

714
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,660
there is no way she is so entertainment 
entertaining.

715
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,503
I mean,
we're not talking about a Jay z concert 

716
00:36:03,731 --> 00:36:04,564
or Kevin Hart isn't doing stand up.
They paid her a quarter million dollars 

717
00:36:07,151 --> 00:36:09,370
to talk for an hour.
Like,

718
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:10,800
that's not real.
Okay.

719
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:11,683
They're not really paying you a quarter 
million dollars because you're so 

720
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,254
awesome.
They really want you to talk for an 

721
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,020
hour.
This is some sort of a bribe.

722
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:21,220
This is some sort of a deal.
You're making a business arrangement.

723
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:25,960
There's no question about it.
There is no way that it's that valuable.

724
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:30,340
It's just not her talking for an hour.
What a hot ticket.

725
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,140
Jesus,
how do I get ahold of that ticket?

726
00:36:32,141 --> 00:36:33,190
I mean,
that is crazy.

727
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,024
Yeah.
The fact that someone could play that 

728
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:38,680
off is if this is a legitimate business 
transaction,

729
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,360
that's nonsense.
Yeah.

730
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,333
And,
and there's a direct correlation there 

731
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:43,380
though,
with,

732
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,273
with Wall Street,
big money in general as you're talking 

733
00:36:46,351 --> 00:36:49,990
about that influence on politics.
I was talking with a guy who's,

734
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,053
when he comes over recovering kind of 
finance guy from Wall Street who's left 

735
00:36:54,181 --> 00:36:57,890
and is now come here to la and um,
and,

736
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,880
and he talked directly about that and we
were talking about how even after 2008,

737
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,703
all the too big to fail banks,
they were bailed out and people are 

738
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:07,644
suffering.
They're losing their homes or pensions 

739
00:37:08,731 --> 00:37:09,564
and all of this stuff.
These banks are bigger today than they 

740
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:15,660
were back then.
And over time,

741
00:37:15,661 --> 00:37:18,930
and even over the last few years,
Congress has slowly,

742
00:37:18,931 --> 00:37:19,764
and this is not just republicans,
there are Democrats who are on the tape 

743
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:22,704
too,
are taken this Wall Street money and 

744
00:37:24,001 --> 00:37:25,530
you're starting to see these bills 
passed,

745
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:26,364
peeling away the very small amount of 
regulations that were put on after that 

746
00:37:29,911 --> 00:37:34,911
crash to get us back to an even worse 
situation than we were back in 2011.

747
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,190
Why?
How could we allow this to happen?

748
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:39,803
There's a ton of money that's coming 
from Wall Street and funding 

749
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,710
politicians' campaigns,
lobbyists who are there helping to write

750
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:49,830
the legislation or kill the bad bills 
and again,

751
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,800
who's who's talking about this?
No one,

752
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,280
right?

753
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,100
Very few people.
How do you stop that though?

754
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:55,963
Like how do you stop the funding,
their campaigns a and then the paid 

755
00:37:58,851 --> 00:38:03,340
speeches be those two things alone.
If you could just cut that out and said,

756
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:03,541
no,
no,

757
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:04,730
no,
you have to be legitimate.

758
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,693
I mean that love or hate Bernie Sanders.
You've got to respect the fact that guy 

759
00:38:08,961 --> 00:38:10,520
never took any money from anybody.
That's right.

760
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,593
And he said,
I'll give you my all my transcripts 

761
00:38:13,611 --> 00:38:16,760
because I don't have any.
I didn't get paid to do any speeches and

762
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:17,660
he's clean.
Yeah,

763
00:38:17,661 --> 00:38:19,580
I mean this is the reason why he can say
that.

764
00:38:19,581 --> 00:38:21,520
And Hillary just ignored it.
I mean,

765
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,630
she just didn't,
didn't respond.

766
00:38:23,631 --> 00:38:24,464
She didn't say,
I'll give you the transcripts because 

767
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:28,940
all I said was I love America and we're 
going to fix everything.

768
00:38:28,941 --> 00:38:29,774
And you bankers are dirty.
It's just they don't pay you to call 

769
00:38:32,781 --> 00:38:34,280
them names.
Exactly,

770
00:38:34,281 --> 00:38:39,281
but it's just strange that there that,
well,

771
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:43,600
it's not strange in terms of the real 
obvious benefit.

772
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,110
If you're going to be a politician and 
you want to run for office,

773
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:47,944
it's incredibly expensive to win,
so you need some money so you have to 

774
00:38:51,911 --> 00:38:52,744
make deals with people who are willing 
to give you some of that money and 

775
00:38:55,481 --> 00:38:56,314
you've got to figure out a way to be 
able to do this and still convinced the 

776
00:38:58,571 --> 00:39:02,200
people that have to vote for you,
that you're on their side.

777
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:02,840
Yeah,

778
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:07,280
and this is where that narrative is 
being disproven.

779
00:39:07,281 --> 00:39:08,114
That somehow if you run for office and 
if you want to serve people within that 

780
00:39:11,481 --> 00:39:12,314
political realm that you,
that you have to go and Kowtow to the 

781
00:39:14,841 --> 00:39:15,674
corporate interests and the people with 
the big money in order to be able to 

782
00:39:18,051 --> 00:39:21,140
fund a campaign in order to win.
So you can do good work for the people.

783
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,243
But also you kind of got,
you told these other guys you're going 

784
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,730
to make them happy to,
um,

785
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:27,643
I don't take any corporate PAC money or 
contributions from pax or lobbyists or 

786
00:39:30,681 --> 00:39:31,514
anything else,
and there are more candidates running 

787
00:39:32,781 --> 00:39:33,614
this year,
did over 100 candidates running for 

788
00:39:34,551 --> 00:39:35,384
Congress this year who have sworn off 
any of those types of contributions and 

789
00:39:39,771 --> 00:39:40,604
who run their campaigns fueled by 
individual donors where there's people 

790
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:47,060
giving five bucks,
people giving more if they can give more

791
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,400
and that,
and they're winning there.

792
00:39:49,401 --> 00:39:50,234
There are a number of candidates who are
showing that they're out raising their 

793
00:39:53,001 --> 00:39:56,540
opponents who are backed by pacs and 
lobbyists.

794
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:57,703
Um,
they're raising more money from people 

795
00:39:59,901 --> 00:40:00,734
who are giving these small dollar 
contributions and disproving that power 

796
00:40:04,251 --> 00:40:07,520
balance where the people really do have 
the power.

797
00:40:07,521 --> 00:40:09,680
If we stand up and get engaged and 
involved.

798
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,120
What do you attribute that to?
What's the change?

799
00:40:12,121 --> 00:40:12,541
Like?
What's,

800
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:13,630
what's causing this tank

801
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,920
change happened?
When Bernie Sanders ran for president?

802
00:40:16,921 --> 00:40:20,580
I think he did a lot better than,
than he first expected that he would.

803
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:25,200
And the fact that he was able to raise,
uh,

804
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:28,560
in some cases more money than Hillary 
Clinton in certain quarters,

805
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,423
he was,
he was very competitive and all of that 

806
00:40:31,231 --> 00:40:34,500
came from those small dollar individual 
contributions,

807
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:35,340
you know,
he talked about it,

808
00:40:35,341 --> 00:40:36,174
you know,
$27 is the average a contribution that 

809
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:41,460
he got.
And that was kind of a rallying cry at a

810
00:40:41,461 --> 00:40:43,390
lot of his events.
Um,

811
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,273
but people,
I think people through that experience 

812
00:40:46,321 --> 00:40:47,154
really woke up to their own power in 
this democracy and that to have a true 

813
00:40:51,811 --> 00:40:52,644
strong democracy,
it really does take us all doing our 

814
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:56,730
part in whatever way that we can.

815
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,640
If Bernie called you up tomorrow and 
said,

816
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,740
I want you to be my vice president,
would you be down?

817
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,900
We'd have to have a conversation.
Come on,

818
00:41:02,901 --> 00:41:05,930
man.
What would the conversation be?

819
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,411
Well,
you know,

820
00:41:06,411 --> 00:41:07,850
he can't.
I mean,

821
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:12,230
he can't run again if he doesn't win in 
20.

822
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:13,723
Right?
Yeah.

823
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,640
I mean basically do.
I mean,

824
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:21,080
unless someone invents some crazy new 
medical technology that reverses aging,

825
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,390
you only have so much life in you.
Yeah.

826
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,400
But you on the other hand,
you can hang in there for eight years.

827
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,080
Yeah.
Not say anything,

828
00:41:30,081 --> 00:41:33,620
which is a yes.
Your wheels are lady.

829
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,250
Look,
I,

830
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,150
I,
um,

831
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:35,990
here.
Here's,

832
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,100
here's the way that I've always done

833
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:37,943
made my decisions from the time I ran 
for the State House representatives in 

834
00:41:42,111 --> 00:41:45,110
Hawaii and I was 21 years old.
A lot of people said like,

835
00:41:45,111 --> 00:41:47,180
what are you doing at 21?
This is crazy.

836
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,020
But I,
I cared very much for my home,

837
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:51,883
my community about environmental issues 
and things that I saw were not being 

838
00:41:56,271 --> 00:42:00,200
addressed by many leaders in our state 
who I felt were out of touch.

839
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,680
Um,
and joining the national guard and later

840
00:42:03,681 --> 00:42:04,514
running for Congress,
I try to make my decisions based on how 

841
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:10,850
and where I feel like I can make the 
most impact.

842
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,480
So that's,
that's what I will continue to do.

843
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,503
Well,
you definitely can make the most impact 

844
00:42:17,231 --> 00:42:19,120
is vice president of the United States 
from America.

845
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,470
Uh,
it depends who you ask.

846
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,423
Well,
if you asked me,

847
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,200
yeah,
your opinion,

848
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,093
I would say,
I would say that's a pretty big 

849
00:42:28,391 --> 00:42:30,130
platform,
although that pence guy,

850
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,210
you don't hear a peep of that guy.
He just kind of heightened.

851
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,510
It's what you make of it,
I guess.

852
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:35,590
Just like any job,
right.

853
00:42:35,591 --> 00:42:37,270
It's what you make of it.
But it's like,

854
00:42:37,271 --> 00:42:39,730
isn't that a joke?
Like if you want someone to disappear,

855
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:42,730
just elected vice president.
I think that's a joke,

856
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,420
right?
Oh yeah.

857
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,850
That's a different story.
Right?

858
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,590
Right.
Or um,

859
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:49,900
house cards too,
right?

860
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,510
Yeah.
I think that's next level.

861
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,400
Yeah.
Yeah.

862
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,600
They're going to keep going.
We're going to kill that guy off somehow

863
00:42:58,601 --> 00:43:02,220
or another.
Somebody asked me when that show

864
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:05,360
for the first season came out,
like some of my family especially,

865
00:43:05,361 --> 00:43:07,430
it may have been my mother like,
honey,

866
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:12,050
is that really what it's supposed to be?
Loosely based on the Clintons

867
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,053
there,
there are some quotes and some things 

868
00:43:14,681 --> 00:43:17,620
like that that Kevin Spacey had as the 
whip in the house.

869
00:43:17,621 --> 00:43:18,970
Like there was some things in there 
like,

870
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,160
Oh wow,
I've actually heard people say that,

871
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:24,100
but all the,
all the salacious stuff.

872
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,410
Like I had to come from my mom's like,
no,

873
00:43:26,411 --> 00:43:28,780
I'm not like catching the subway late at
night and.

874
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,340
Right.
Yeah.

875
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:32,830
Well that's,
that's a little bit was some of the top.

876
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,660
Yeah,
that was a little ridiculous.

877
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:37,200
Meet me by the subway.
Yeah.

878
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:41,300
Spoiler for anybody.
Um,

879
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,220
but as a long time ago.
Yeah.

880
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:48,660
But for a lot of people that is their 
education on politics unfortunately.

881
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,420
But it's just such a complicated 
process.

882
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,254
If you're a person that has a full time 
job and a mortgage and kids and maybe 

883
00:43:58,331 --> 00:44:01,390
you got a hobby and you're supposed to 
be paying attention to these people that

884
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:03,790
are running the country or running 
whatever it is,

885
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:07,270
running the Senate or anything 
political,

886
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:09,220
it's just too complicated.
It's tough.

887
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,740
Like what you were talking about with 
these bills that get passed,

888
00:44:11,741 --> 00:44:16,030
that have these hidden agendas deeply 
written into a thousand page document.

889
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,480
How can a person who has three kids and 
a mortgage and a 40 plus hour a week job

890
00:44:22,781 --> 00:44:25,020
plus commuting,
how can they pay attention to all this?

891
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:25,340
No.

892
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:28,970
It's very hard.
And that's where you come in.

893
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:29,871
Yeah.
And,

894
00:44:29,871 --> 00:44:30,704
and you know,
like I try to put stuff out on twitter 

895
00:44:31,981 --> 00:44:32,814
and facebook and Instagram,
social media because most of us are on 

896
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:37,860
those platforms and as you're scrolling 
through,

897
00:44:37,861 --> 00:44:39,810
like maybe you're going to see that one 
thing like,

898
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:40,321
hey,
you know,

899
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:42,830
Congress just passed this bill making,
you know,

900
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:43,773
deregulating a fracking and liquid 
natural gas that's affecting your water 

901
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:49,104
and your air and connecting the dots 
between what can seem like very out of 

902
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:56,220
touch policy,
wonky things too.

903
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,140
Okay.
How does this actually affect you,

904
00:44:58,350 --> 00:44:59,760
your family,
your kids,

905
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,653
your house educated,
like the things that really do take up 

906
00:45:02,971 --> 00:45:07,971
most of people's time and consciousness 
and care on it on a daily basis.

907
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:09,983
Yeah,
and that's one of the more dangerous 

908
00:45:13,261 --> 00:45:14,094
things I think about having a person 
like trump as president is that it's 

909
00:45:17,461 --> 00:45:21,810
eroding people's confidence in the 
person that runs the big show.

910
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,210
Is that your.

911
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,263
That's one of,
that's one of a number of things that 

912
00:45:26,951 --> 00:45:28,960
have eroded people's confidence.
I think if you,

913
00:45:28,961 --> 00:45:29,794
if you take that one step further and 
look at how people's confidence in our 

914
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:37,420
entire election system has been eroded 
a,

915
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:40,770
when you look at all of the 
vulnerabilities that exist,

916
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:43,030
a lot of the stuff that's being talked 
about now,

917
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,950
do you mean in terms of electronic 
voting,

918
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:46,170
the machines or.

919
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:47,123
Yes.
I think overall people doubt whether or 

920
00:45:48,801 --> 00:45:50,720
not their votes matter.
First of all,

921
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:52,880
did you see the documentary hacking 
democracy?

922
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:54,380
No,
I didn't.

923
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:55,603
It's fascinating.
And it was in regards to what year was 

924
00:45:59,031 --> 00:46:01,160
that?
I want to say it's 2008.

925
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,340
Was it eight?
Six.

926
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:08,600
Six.
So it was about Bush and Kerry,

927
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:12,470
right?
Wasn't that Bush and Gore?

928
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,680
Was it Bush and Gore?
Whatever it was.

929
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,470
Both of elections actually.
Okay.

930
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:23,890
But it showed how there is built in 
third party access.

931
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:27,360
So it's literally built into the system.
Right.

932
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:32,180
That a third party can influence the 
count and they showed how they did it on

933
00:46:32,181 --> 00:46:32,780
the,
um,

934
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:33,613
in the actual documentary they used 
these machines and influence the 

935
00:46:37,911 --> 00:46:39,780
results.
Yeah,

936
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,400
yeah,

937
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:40,661
yeah.
What,

938
00:46:40,661 --> 00:46:41,494
what to speak of the.
At the DEF defcon hacking conference 

939
00:46:45,231 --> 00:46:47,930
that just happened or happens annually 
in Vegas,

940
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:50,420
but they just had one this year,
a couple of months ago,

941
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,033
maybe a few weeks ago.
We're an 1111 year old girl hacked into 

942
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:58,100
a replica of Florida's,
uh,

943
00:46:58,130 --> 00:46:58,963
election system and change the outcome 
of their election in less than 15 

944
00:47:02,901 --> 00:47:03,430
minutes.

945
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:04,263
It is an 11 year old hacked into US 
voting system in 10 minutes this 

946
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,350
weekend.
Oh,

947
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,200
11 years old.
Well,

948
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:13,170
that's American engineers one ma'am.
That's what we do here.

949
00:47:13,171 --> 00:47:16,020
We breed them young and smart.
Hire that kid.

950
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:21,350
Exactly right.
If there's tons more,

951
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:23,550
tons more like her.
Oh,

952
00:47:23,551 --> 00:47:25,150
there's probably millions now.
I mean,

953
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:30,010
kids growing up with computers from the 
time they're little and fit in learning,

954
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,040
coding like they're learning the English
language

955
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,180
and just like the drive and kind of the 
thought process and that,

956
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:42,340
that kind of desire to take things to 
the night and not just say,

957
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:43,151
okay,
okay,

958
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,560
this is an ipad.
This is how it works.

959
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:45,650
That's fine.
It's like,

960
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,780
well,
how do we make the next,

961
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,673
the next generation of this?
How do we break this and makes the next 

962
00:47:50,471 --> 00:47:51,304
better thing,

963
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,800
but we can bank online,
right?

964
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:57,430
Yeah.
Why can't they vote online?

965
00:47:57,431 --> 00:48:00,640
Why can't they make all of this as 
secure as they do banking?

966
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:01,510
Well,
you,

967
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:05,450
you still see every now and then fraud.
Well yeah,

968
00:48:05,451 --> 00:48:07,310
there's bank fraud,
there's direct bank fraud,

969
00:48:07,311 --> 00:48:08,890
but you also see,
um,

970
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:11,600
banks get hacked and yeah,
they've got,

971
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:13,790
I mean they've got,
you know,

972
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:14,653
their reserves and all that other stuff 
and they try to deal with those 

973
00:48:16,911 --> 00:48:18,740
vulnerabilities and try to stay ahead of
them.

974
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:22,310
But even the technology that banks use 
is not foolproof.

975
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,593
And when we're talking again about 
voters having confidence that when they 

976
00:48:26,961 --> 00:48:30,590
take that time on election day,
take off from work or school or whatever

977
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,800
and go cast that vote that it's going to
be counted and counted accurately.

978
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:36,973
Like this is what's at stake.
If people don't have confidence in that 

979
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,330
then then we are in serious trouble.
So one thing that,

980
00:48:44,331 --> 00:48:45,164
uh,
I introduced a bill a few months ago 

981
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:51,410
based on last year's defcon hacking 
conference results that,

982
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,770
that really showed the best way to 
secure our elections systems.

983
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,613
The actual systems themselves is either 
used paper ballots or have a voter 

984
00:48:59,781 --> 00:49:00,614
verified paper backup.
If you're going to use an electronic 

985
00:49:03,951 --> 00:49:04,380
system,

986
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,190
so you have an electronic system,
then a voter verified paper backup,

987
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,600
so if there's any dispute whatsoever,
then you go to the paper,

988
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:12,720
go to the payment,
they don't correspond.

989
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,800
You can go to the paper.
So in Hawaii for example,

990
00:49:15,801 --> 00:49:18,560
you can choose when I go vote,
I can grab a paper ballot,

991
00:49:18,561 --> 00:49:21,710
traditional or I can go to the the 
machine,

992
00:49:21,711 --> 00:49:26,270
which I usually do go through and make 
my selections and before I hit the final

993
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,104
submit ballot button,
there's a little printout that pops up 

994
00:49:29,481 --> 00:49:30,314
in a little window that shows a my voter
number who I selected to vote for so I 

995
00:49:35,991 --> 00:49:38,960
can actually check the paper myself 
before hitting submit.

996
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,233
So we just did this.
Virginia has off your statewide 

997
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:44,143
elections,
so they had theirs in 2017 and after 

998
00:49:47,091 --> 00:49:50,480
that defcon hacking conference happened 
at last year.

999
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:54,650
They said we have to fix this before our
election,

1000
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,990
and they did.
How did they mess up?

1001
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:00,200
They implemented.
They did paper ballots or they did paper

1002
00:50:00,201 --> 00:50:01,034
ballot voter verified paper backups and 
their elections commissioners came and 

1003
00:50:05,181 --> 00:50:06,014
testified in Congress,
have after the elections were done and 

1004
00:50:08,961 --> 00:50:13,910
they said that that was the first time 
in their entire careers that they didn't

1005
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:14,744
have a single complaint about the 
accuracy of the vote count itself were 

1006
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:23,350
in previous years they had,
but they're proof that you can turn like

1007
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,650
you identify the problem.

1008
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:25,853
This is not going to take years to fix 
like can action that within weeks and 

1009
00:50:29,511 --> 00:50:32,270
actually secure the outcome of these 
elections.

1010
00:50:32,271 --> 00:50:34,790
That's what I've been pushing for a in 
Congress,

1011
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:38,000
especially as we had to these midterms,
especially as we head into 20 slash 20.

1012
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:41,630
But again it goes back to the point like
my bill hasn't gotten a vote yet.

1013
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,180
Why is that?
It's a very simple black,

1014
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:47,000
nonpartisan bill.
Here's a problem.

1015
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:49,220
Here's the solution.
We can action this now,

1016
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:50,623
but you have leaders in both parties who
are just continuing to fight and and 

1017
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:54,974
Fred and Moan and Groan about how we 
have all these vulnerabilities in our 

1018
00:50:58,041 --> 00:51:00,800
elections but not actually doing 
anything about it.

1019
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:04,520
To using it as a partisan kind of 
political football,

1020
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:05,690
but again,
why,

1021
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:08,900
why don't you actually solve it?
Why do you think they don't solve it?

1022
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:12,620
Because it's issues like this,
that it helped with fundraising and they

1023
00:51:12,621 --> 00:51:13,454
help kind of motivate people and they 
worry people and they bring all these 

1024
00:51:16,221 --> 00:51:17,840
fears about.
It's good for ratings.

1025
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:20,120
It's all,
all these different reasons,

1026
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:21,423
um,
that frustrate people frankly who know 

1027
00:51:24,171 --> 00:51:26,360
about it when they're not actually 
seeing,

1028
00:51:26,361 --> 00:51:27,380
you know,
deliver results.

1029
00:51:27,381 --> 00:51:29,090
You're talking about a problem now for 
months,

1030
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:30,680
congressmen talking about this for 
months.

1031
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:32,930
Whereas the results.

1032
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:38,640
So you think that they actively are 
ignoring the potential solutions or that

1033
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:43,000
they literally want to keep this problem
going?

1034
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,020
That's a good question.
But the,

1035
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:45,681
the,
you know,

1036
00:51:45,681 --> 00:51:46,514
we have been talking about this a number
of outside kind of election security 

1037
00:51:50,031 --> 00:51:50,864
experts have been talking about this.
Some of the hackers have been talking 

1038
00:51:53,241 --> 00:51:57,560
about the fact that the only way you can
secure an election is by using paper.

1039
00:51:58,610 --> 00:51:59,443
I cannot,
I cannot come up with an excuse for why 

1040
00:52:03,111 --> 00:52:07,770
the leaders in these committees and in 
Congress have not actually.

1041
00:52:07,771 --> 00:52:09,950
It's like whether it's my biller,
someone else's bill,

1042
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:11,203
why haven't they actually solve this 
because it's something that could 

1043
00:52:14,781 --> 00:52:17,360
potentially impact us in the coming 
weeks and months.

1044
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,361
Well,
I remember the,

1045
00:52:19,361 --> 00:52:20,920
the hanging Chad.
Yeah.

1046
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,480
Controversy.
Yeah.

1047
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:23,363
Yeah.
And how many different votes got thrown 

1048
00:52:24,861 --> 00:52:25,694
out and then there was,
there was also so many people that were 

1049
00:52:28,221 --> 00:52:32,010
denied the right to vote.
Was it in Florida because a,

1050
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:32,973
they either have the same name or 
similar names with people that had some 

1051
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:38,954
sort of a criminal record if somebody 
made a typo when they put their name in 

1052
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:45,210
the system and then they were,
they were made ineligible.

1053
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,780
And then there was also some concern 
that some of that was deliberate because

1054
00:52:47,781 --> 00:52:51,200
so much of it was taking place in 
democratic districts.

1055
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:53,030
Yeah.
It's um,

1056
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:59,020
it's very disconcerting the idea that 
someone would try to rig an election.

1057
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:00,223
Yeah.
I mean we would like to think that that 

1058
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,980
is an absolutely an American thing to 
think of,

1059
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,053
but people could,
isn't.

1060
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,000
It is,
but people can come up with very strange

1061
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:12,910
reasons for justification of a very 
awful acts.

1062
00:53:12,911 --> 00:53:14,650
Yeah.
And this seems to be one of them.

1063
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:16,190
They think their site is right.

1064
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:17,421
Oh,
that,

1065
00:53:17,421 --> 00:53:18,850
that points to,
um,

1066
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:19,823
the,
the super delegate issue that Democrats 

1067
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:22,034
have been dealing with were people who 
have been arguing to keep the system of 

1068
00:53:26,731 --> 00:53:30,540
super delegates were in a state like 
mine in Hawaii for example.

1069
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:34,190
We've got four super delegate votes,
uh,

1070
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,273
to,
for the members of Congress in two for 

1071
00:53:36,151 --> 00:53:36,984
the senator.
Explain that to people who don't know 

1072
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:38,514
what a super dog.
So this is something that is created by 

1073
00:53:43,861 --> 00:53:47,250
the political parties themselves.
So the Democratic Party has,

1074
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,130
has been using the superdelegate system 
where,

1075
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:53,130
um,
as people are running for president,

1076
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,113
you have a certain number of delegates 
that go to one person or another based 

1077
00:53:59,401 --> 00:54:00,234
on that state's rules.
So some states say it's winner take all 

1078
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:07,920
other states say that it's proportional.
So if you get 60 percent of the vote,

1079
00:54:07,921 --> 00:54:09,870
that means you get 60 percent of the 
delegates.

1080
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,720
But then you have this special category 
of super delegates,

1081
00:54:12,721 --> 00:54:14,640
which there are over 700 of them.

1082
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,830
It includes all 435 members of,
of,

1083
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,910
sorry,
all democratic members of Congress,

1084
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,253
Democrats in the Senate and people who 
are appointed by the party leadership 

1085
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,410
both at the state and the national 
level.

1086
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:30,900
And so,
um,

1087
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:32,600
what we saw in,
in,

1088
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:33,483
in my state of Hawaii for example,
is over 70 percent of the voters voted 

1089
00:54:39,181 --> 00:54:40,014
for Bernie Sanders.
But out of those four super delegate 

1090
00:54:42,751 --> 00:54:45,690
votes,
he got one which was mine.

1091
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:51,480
So the superdelegates don't have to cast
their votes to reflect how the,

1092
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:55,260
their constituents voted.
So of the rest of them vote,

1093
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:59,580
they voted for Hillary.
So that puts you in a situation where,

1094
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:02,700
and this is not about while Bernie would
have won without superdome,

1095
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:03,623
this is not even what that's about.
This is about really looking at people 

1096
00:55:06,031 --> 00:55:06,864
casting their votes.
And then you have this special group of 

1097
00:55:09,421 --> 00:55:13,530
people who are either elected or 
appointed who can then say,

1098
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,190
Nah,
I don't,

1099
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:17,940
I don't agree with the way that the 
people in my state or my district voted.

1100
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:22,370
So I'm just going to vote the other way.
And then shift a,

1101
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,273
potentially the outcome of that election
for that state or for the country so 

1102
00:55:25,501 --> 00:55:27,190
that it shifted for Hawaiian.
Yeah.

1103
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:30,060
Yeah.
So Hillary won Hawaii's.

1104
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:30,953
I'm a super delegates,
but the people voted differently and it 

1105
00:55:36,301 --> 00:55:39,360
was 70 percent of the people voted for.
It wasn't close.

1106
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:40,343
It was,
it was.

1107
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,240
And that was how you,
how you saw that.

1108
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:46,950
So in some states where,
you know,

1109
00:55:46,951 --> 00:55:48,630
I think,
I don't know for mod I,

1110
00:55:48,631 --> 00:55:49,464
there,
there are a few other states that I 

1111
00:55:50,131 --> 00:55:52,260
remember looking at where,
um,

1112
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,570
when they were counting the votes as 
they were coming in,

1113
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:01,890
they would report one number,
but if Bernie won the state,

1114
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,380
his number was zero.
And then there was a certain number that

1115
00:56:04,381 --> 00:56:05,214
was already built in to Hillary's count 
before the votes were even finally 

1116
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:11,900
tallied because she had already had the 
declared supportive.

1117
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:16,940
Those super delegates within that state.
So the Republicans don't do this.

1118
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,053
I think they may have super delegates,
but those super delegates are required 

1119
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:25,460
to reflect the votes of their 
constituency.

1120
00:56:25,461 --> 00:56:28,720
So they don't have the freedom to change
their,

1121
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:32,520
change their vote or change their mind.
But um,

1122
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:34,540
yeah,
this is uh,

1123
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:35,980
this,
so this is something that I've been,

1124
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:36,873
I've been fighting to,
to try to reform within our party is to 

1125
00:56:39,491 --> 00:56:40,324
get rid of superdelegates to make it so 
that we have open primaries so that you 

1126
00:56:45,581 --> 00:56:46,414
don't have to be a card carrying party 
member to vote in Democratic primary 

1127
00:56:49,091 --> 00:56:49,924
because that was another problem we saw 
across the country where people were 

1128
00:56:52,211 --> 00:56:53,044
turned away because in some cases while 
you didn't register with the party a 

1129
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:58,780
year ago,
which is the requirement and so,

1130
00:56:58,781 --> 00:56:59,614
um,
have open primaries and then you have 

1131
00:57:01,181 --> 00:57:03,780
same day registration if you're not 
registered to vote,

1132
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,633
should be able to register to vote on 
the day of the election so that you can 

1133
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:09,070
participate in our democracy.

1134
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,270
So those things seem so clear cut but 
seems to,

1135
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:13,240
are drawing.
But the,

1136
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:15,220
the,
the superdelegate issue in particular,

1137
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:16,620
that's so disturbing.
Yeah.

1138
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,260
But seems so dirty.
Yeah.

1139
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,260
So there's been some progress made sense
then though,

1140
00:57:20,261 --> 00:57:23,260
just recently the DNC had a meeting 
where,

1141
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,153
uh,
it was a very strong majority of people 

1142
00:57:25,811 --> 00:57:30,370
who voted to bar super delegates from a 
casting.

1143
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:31,204
They're their own free votes in the 
first ballot in a presidential 

1144
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:40,630
convention,
so I don't know,

1145
00:57:40,631 --> 00:57:42,220
it's been a long time since,
uh,

1146
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,090
uh,
uh,

1147
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:46,210
it's gone to the second or third ballot,
but that,

1148
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:47,063
that was a major step forward to make 
sure that as people are going and 

1149
00:57:51,071 --> 00:57:55,090
casting their votes in these primaries,
that they're not risking being overruled

1150
00:57:55,091 --> 00:57:55,924
by again,
a group of special individuals who are 

1151
00:57:57,581 --> 00:57:58,414
elected officials,
who are lobbyists and who are party 

1152
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:03,190
officials and people who are coming from
all different backgrounds.

1153
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:04,983
Is there any resistance to getting rid 
of these super because the resistance 

1154
00:58:09,101 --> 00:58:09,934
was very strong.
It was not a given that he's going to 

1155
00:58:11,801 --> 00:58:16,210
pass at all people who are very,
very invested in this system.

1156
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:20,350
It seems like they would have to be 
invested in keeping the system rigged.

1157
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:21,423
Like making it easy to influence 
elections by having these few people 

1158
00:58:24,581 --> 00:58:27,400
that you can control having influence 
over these people.

1159
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:30,490
These people have massive influence over
the results of the election.

1160
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,070
It's,
it is,

1161
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:33,701
it,
it's,

1162
00:58:33,701 --> 00:58:38,410
it's so counter intuitive to what we 
stand for with our democracy.

1163
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:41,060
And I think there is,
um,

1164
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,310
I mean it's a fear of losing power,
I think ultimately is what it comes down

1165
00:58:45,311 --> 00:58:46,660
to.
And you have people who said,

1166
00:58:46,661 --> 00:58:47,141
hey,
look,

1167
00:58:47,141 --> 00:58:49,540
I've given my life to the party,
you know,

1168
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:52,450
I've put in all of this time and energy,
I'm a volunteer,

1169
00:58:52,451 --> 00:58:55,050
I'm doing this and all of that,
which all of that is,

1170
00:58:55,051 --> 00:59:00,051
is fine and it's great,
but that shouldn't make it so that like,

1171
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:01,360
you know,
as,

1172
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,640
as myself as a super delegate,
I've talked about this,

1173
00:59:03,641 --> 00:59:04,474
I shouldn't have any.
My vote should count for any more than 

1174
00:59:07,421 --> 00:59:12,100
yours or anyone else's and that we 
should be strengthening and,

1175
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:17,140
and empowering and uplifting the voices 
of the people rather than saying,

1176
00:59:17,501 --> 00:59:18,334
well,
this small elite group has way more 

1177
00:59:20,231 --> 00:59:23,330
power than you.
We'll see what they think about things.

1178
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,930
It's so bizarre that that's a part of 
the system.

1179
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:30,010
It just seems like that's something that
should have been eradicated a long time.

1180
00:59:30,011 --> 00:59:33,160
I should have been now.
Bernie Sanders had to be fuming.

1181
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:34,900
Yeah,
I mean from that.

1182
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:36,183
And then from finding out the DNC 
actively conspired to have him lose the 

1183
00:59:39,731 --> 00:59:41,110
primary.
All of that.

1184
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,083
Sorry,
one last thing on the superdelegates 

1185
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:44,183
that some of those who support it have 
said is that it is their job to be able 

1186
00:59:48,211 --> 00:59:51,330
to save the country in case the people 
elect someone

1187
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,840
who isn't good.
Really hilarious.

1188
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:57,940
That is hilarious.
Justification.

1189
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,960
Oh,
you know better than the whole country.

1190
00:59:59,961 --> 01:00:01,360
Yeah.
You must be super smart.

1191
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:03,760
What kind of tests do you have to take?
Super Delicate.

1192
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:06,070
Become a super delegate.
What do you have to do?

1193
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:08,800
Yeah.
It's certainly not a written test,

1194
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:09,310
you know,
it's,

1195
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:10,031
it's really.
I mean,

1196
01:00:10,031 --> 01:00:10,751
again,
you're either,

1197
01:00:10,751 --> 01:00:11,584
you're either an elected member of 
Congress or you're somebody who the 

1198
01:00:14,171 --> 01:00:15,250
party chooses.

1199
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,500
Wow.
The idea that the reason to keep that is

1200
01:00:18,501 --> 01:00:20,240
because you know better.
I mean,

1201
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:22,400
that's essentially what they're saying,
you know better than all the people that

1202
01:00:22,401 --> 01:00:23,234
voted.
Yeah.

1203
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,810
So disrespectful to it's crazy people.
It's really crazy.

1204
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,110
Yeah.
MMM.

1205
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:30,330
So I mean that,
that's been,

1206
01:00:30,331 --> 01:00:32,800
I think a positive thing that has come 
through all of this is,

1207
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:34,770
is more people are like,
you know,

1208
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:35,743
I honestly wasn't paying a bunch of 
attention to superdelegates before all 

1209
01:00:38,191 --> 01:00:41,130
of this and a lot of people had their 
eyes opened up to say,

1210
01:00:41,131 --> 01:00:42,930
okay,
this is clearly wrong.

1211
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:47,970
Why was it there in the first place?
Let's do something to fix the process.

1212
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:48,883
Well,
most people don't think until this 

1213
01:00:50,031 --> 01:00:50,864
election,
the general public wasn't even aware 

1214
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,470
that that was,
that that was a case.

1215
01:00:54,471 --> 01:00:59,240
Yeah.
And then when people find out about it,

1216
01:00:59,241 --> 01:00:59,720
they go,
wait,

1217
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:00,200
wait,
wait,

1218
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,033
what?
What?

1219
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,610
They can just decide to not vote the 
same way that people voted.

1220
01:01:04,611 --> 01:01:05,444
Yeah.
And then the state can lose or I mean 

1221
01:01:07,221 --> 01:01:10,430
the person could lose the state even 
though 70 percent of the state voted for

1222
01:01:10,431 --> 01:01:11,264
that person.
Right.

1223
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:12,270
That's insane.
Yeah,

1224
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,630
it is.
Did you read Donna Brazile's book?

1225
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:19,710
I didn't read the whole book.
I heard I got extra excerpts from it and

1226
01:01:19,711 --> 01:01:20,544
have it.

1227
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:21,930
Um,
I will.

1228
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I was shocked that they conspired to 
have hillary win the primaries.

1229
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:30,970
I was more shocked that more people 
weren't outraged.

1230
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,190
Yeah.
What does that tell you?

1231
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:34,323
It tells you that people have sort of 
resigned to the idea that this is a 

1232
01:01:37,571 --> 01:01:40,120
corrupt system,
that they don't have time.

1233
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:42,600
It goes back to what we're saying 
earlier that you know,

1234
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,190
people are exhausted.
Yeah.

1235
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:46,360
Most people,
most people are exhausted

1236
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:49,780
and I think that's where you see a lot 
of,

1237
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:56,010
a lot of the energy that came around for
somebody like Bernie Sanders or somebody

1238
01:01:56,831 --> 01:02:00,880
like Donald Trump who are perceived as 
being not of the system,

1239
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:06,280
but it,
it shows us,

1240
01:02:06,281 --> 01:02:08,500
it shows us where we need to go 
honestly.

1241
01:02:08,501 --> 01:02:13,501
And you were talking about authentic,
honest leaders who have integrity and,

1242
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:15,693
and um,
I think people are not as blind to the 

1243
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,390
people can tell.
You can tell if you're being real or not

1244
01:02:24,391 --> 01:02:26,130
or if you're selling them a false bill 
of goods.

1245
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,990
I think they're better at it now.
Yeah,

1246
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,010
yeah,
yeah.

1247
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:30,330
Paying more attention.

1248
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:31,490
Well,
there's also this,

1249
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:33,980
there's enough footage of people now

1250
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,460
that's.
Yeah,

1251
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:38,430
everybody's a reporter now.
I mean,

1252
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:41,530
so it's easy to go back and you say,
well,

1253
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:44,040
look at this interview from four years 
ago when they,

1254
01:02:44,041 --> 01:02:44,571
uh,
were,

1255
01:02:44,571 --> 01:02:46,460
were completely different.
Like what happened?

1256
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:47,533
I mean,
there's also like calculated maneuvers 

1257
01:02:49,551 --> 01:02:50,384
that people do politically to align 
themselves with one group or another 

1258
01:02:53,001 --> 01:02:53,930
where they realized like,
okay,

1259
01:02:53,931 --> 01:02:56,450
there's just a lot of money in being a 
of this.

1260
01:02:56,451 --> 01:02:57,284
That's a,
that,

1261
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:58,243
you know,
there's a lot of money and being a 

1262
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:02,900
whatever it is,
republican or Democrat or there's,

1263
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:04,970
there's an angle for success,

1264
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:06,150
right?
Yeah.

1265
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:07,590
That's,
um,

1266
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:09,563
all of those different labels and things
that people are capitalizing on within 

1267
01:03:12,151 --> 01:03:12,984
the political world I think are the 
things that are turning off more and 

1268
01:03:15,031 --> 01:03:18,120
more people to the politics.
Because then it's like,

1269
01:03:18,121 --> 01:03:20,310
well,
if you're not branded with this label,

1270
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:21,263
then I'm not going to talk to you.
I'm not going to have a conversation or 

1271
01:03:23,851 --> 01:03:27,750
it's this camp versus another camp.
This tribe versus another tribe.

1272
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:33,180
Rather than like recognizing even 
amongst our own families and friends and

1273
01:03:33,181 --> 01:03:34,014
communities like we,
we figure out ways to talk things 

1274
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:37,854
through and find ways to collaborate and
areas where we agree we can agree to 

1275
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:43,950
disagree on certain things,
but we can do that with,

1276
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:44,983
you know,
we in Hawaii called Aloha and with 

1277
01:03:45,961 --> 01:03:50,520
respect and actually find a way through 
to move forward.

1278
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:56,400
There's a lot of things that have been 
discussed in terms of the future of,

1279
01:03:57,461 --> 01:03:58,294
uh,
of economics in particular with regards 

1280
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:03,214
to artificial intelligence and 
automation and these radical changes 

1281
01:04:07,151 --> 01:04:10,180
that are probably coming whether we like
it or not.

1282
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:11,343
And one of the things that's been 
discussed as a potential solution to 

1283
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:18,820
some of the economic woes is a universal
basic income.

1284
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:20,050
Have you studied this?

1285
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:24,150
Studying it now I'm looking at some of 
the places that have,

1286
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:28,110
have or are currently kind of launching 
pilot projects.

1287
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:29,423
I know there's a European country that 
did a two year pilot and then they 

1288
01:04:32,611 --> 01:04:35,700
decided not to go down that route.
Um,

1289
01:04:35,701 --> 01:04:37,320
I think there's a.
so,

1290
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:37,971
so yeah,
I'm,

1291
01:04:37,971 --> 01:04:40,380
I'm taking a hard look at this because 
there are,

1292
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:41,223
there are strong arguments I think on,
on both sides that we got to look and 

1293
01:04:43,681 --> 01:04:45,170
see what,
um,

1294
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:47,280
what would the effects actually be?

1295
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:50,080
Yeah,
I'm torn on as well.

1296
01:04:50,081 --> 01:04:53,680
I'm very open to the idea of it because 
I think that we,

1297
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:54,553
we very well could run into a situation 
where millions of people are almost 

1298
01:04:57,641 --> 01:05:00,610
instantly out of jobs and there no 
solution for that.

1299
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:05,140
And then out of jobs by their choice or 
out of jobs by automation,

1300
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,050
artificial intelligence.
Exactly their position,

1301
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:08,630
right?
Yeah.

1302
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:11,980
I mean this is a real problem and I 
don't think,

1303
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:16,210
I don't think it's gonna I don't think 
it's kind of happened slowly,

1304
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,193
right?
I think problem's gonna stumble onto us 

1305
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:20,330
very quickly.
Yeah.

1306
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:21,573
And we are not prepared for this.
And then there's a problem 

1307
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:26,800
psychologically.
People say that,

1308
01:05:26,801 --> 01:05:29,290
well,
if you just give people money,

1309
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:31,630
you take away their ambition and their 
will.

1310
01:05:31,631 --> 01:05:32,464
And one of the things that makes America
great is it people hustle and that you 

1311
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:40,480
give a bunch of people money but they 
don't earn and they're going to be lazy.

1312
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:43,690
Yeah,
I mean this is the front counter.

1313
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:47,310
I think there's another one that points 
to,

1314
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:52,620
if you look at how much,
how much taxpayer dollars are spent on,

1315
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:53,963
um,
like section eight housing or different 

1316
01:05:55,681 --> 01:05:59,280
affordable housing programs on food 
stamps,

1317
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:03,780
on kind of these different social 
welfare programs.

1318
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,920
How much are we spending on overhead to 
administer those programs?

1319
01:06:07,921 --> 01:06:08,754
And so would it make more economic sense
to just kind of compile all of those 

1320
01:06:12,841 --> 01:06:17,841
benefits into one package and just give 
people a check instead of piecing it out

1321
01:06:18,721 --> 01:06:19,554
through all of these different things.
And would we actually save money as a 

1322
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:23,700
country by doing so?

1323
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,360
And the argument to,
um,

1324
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:27,353
incentivize productivity even amongst 
people that are accepting universal 

1325
01:06:30,931 --> 01:06:31,764
basic income,
I believe is to let them keep it no 

1326
01:06:34,051 --> 01:06:34,884
matter what.
So the idea is even if you make 

1327
01:06:36,391 --> 01:06:37,224
$10,000,000 a year,
you're gonna still get x amount of 

1328
01:06:39,841 --> 01:06:41,970
dollars per month as universal basic 
income.

1329
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,690
And you can choose to donate that to 
causes of your choice,

1330
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:50,340
but if you're a person who's concerned 
that this is going to somehow or another

1331
01:06:50,341 --> 01:06:54,450
stifle people's motivation to get jobs,
because if you get a job then they won't

1332
01:06:54,451 --> 01:06:56,130
get that money,
which is the case with Welfare.

1333
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:56,790
Right?
Right.

1334
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:58,580
So the idea that you know,
you,

1335
01:06:59,040 --> 01:06:59,873
you,
it's very difficult to get someone when 

1336
01:07:02,191 --> 01:07:03,720
you're giving them free money to say,
look,

1337
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,240
you're going to have to work harder and 
then you're gonna get less.

1338
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:07,800
They're going to go,
why?

1339
01:07:07,801 --> 01:07:09,690
Why would I work harder?
So the idea is,

1340
01:07:09,691 --> 01:07:12,240
and I believe Elon Musk is one of the 
ones that came up with this.

1341
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:14,250
Well,
don't take away the money.

1342
01:07:14,251 --> 01:07:17,130
Like everybody gets it no matter what.
You could choose to do whatever you want

1343
01:07:17,131 --> 01:07:20,390
with it.
But the way to incentivize action,

1344
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,390
productivity is to make that money just 
universally available to everyone.

1345
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:27,020
Yeah.
Is this the universal aspect of,

1346
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,860
um,
of that?

1347
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:29,551
Yeah.
You know,

1348
01:07:29,551 --> 01:07:30,261
I mean,
I kind of,

1349
01:07:30,261 --> 01:07:30,740
yeah,
believe

1350
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:32,060
that.
I mean,

1351
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:34,213
just culturally people.
And we were talking about these young 

1352
01:07:36,411 --> 01:07:38,000
kids for example,
you know,

1353
01:07:38,001 --> 01:07:40,220
I mean they're not getting paid one 
thing or another,

1354
01:07:40,221 --> 01:07:43,790
but just their drive and their interests
and kind of their intellectual.

1355
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:47,420
I'm a direction,
I don't know.

1356
01:07:47,421 --> 01:07:48,920
I think people are,
are,

1357
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:54,030
are not necessarily lazy by nature and,
and I think there's something to be said

1358
01:07:54,291 --> 01:07:57,960
for wanting to actually get things done 
and I think you,

1359
01:07:57,961 --> 01:08:00,170
you open up rather than saying,
well,

1360
01:08:00,171 --> 01:08:02,000
we've just got to um,
our,

1361
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:05,040
our purpose is just to work in a job.
You,

1362
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:09,860
you maybe broaden that spectrum to where
your purpose in life is not just to work

1363
01:08:09,861 --> 01:08:13,640
good paying job,
but actually have meaning and purpose to

1364
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:15,980
what you're doing with your life.
That's best case

1365
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:16,601
scenario,
right?

1366
01:08:16,601 --> 01:08:17,434
Yeah.
Best case scenario with universal basic 

1367
01:08:18,621 --> 01:08:21,230
income is you give people the 
opportunity to pursue their dreams,

1368
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:22,280
right?
Yeah.

1369
01:08:22,281 --> 01:08:24,770
I mean,
I think that in large part,

1370
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:25,903
maybe the problem is planting the seed 
in young people at an early age that 

1371
01:08:31,311 --> 01:08:32,144
you're,
you're not supposed to just try to make 

1372
01:08:34,191 --> 01:08:37,490
money to survive that here,
here's your money to survive.

1373
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,950
Just what do you want?
What do you want?

1374
01:08:39,951 --> 01:08:40,610
What,
what do you,

1375
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:43,550
how do you think you would best fit in 
in this world?

1376
01:08:43,551 --> 01:08:46,220
Like what is your contribution?
What could you do?

1377
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,160
And I think that's,
that's um,

1378
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:53,560
that opens it up into kind of how we 
view education in this country and how,

1379
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:55,700
um,
you know,

1380
01:08:55,701 --> 01:08:56,534
there's all this,
this drive towards while you've got to 

1381
01:08:58,131 --> 01:08:59,480
get a college degree,
you've got to do this,

1382
01:08:59,481 --> 01:09:00,314
you've got to do that.
But really there's a lot more where 

1383
01:09:02,061 --> 01:09:03,650
people aren't asking those questions.
Like,

1384
01:09:03,651 --> 01:09:06,590
what do you really want to do with your 
life?

1385
01:09:06,591 --> 01:09:11,480
Asking that that most important question
of purpose and seeing well,

1386
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:13,183
getting,
getting a bachelor's degree or master's 

1387
01:09:15,591 --> 01:09:20,180
degree or whatever that may not.
That may not be what you want or how you

1388
01:09:20,181 --> 01:09:21,014
feel you can best use your time of your 
skills and whether it's vocational 

1389
01:09:23,241 --> 01:09:24,074
training or,
or doing something else or be starting 

1390
01:09:25,791 --> 01:09:28,280
up a business right away or,
or anything else.

1391
01:09:28,281 --> 01:09:29,114
I think there's,
we just have to broaden the spectrum 

1392
01:09:30,651 --> 01:09:33,170
here so that we're not so tunnel 
visioned more.

1393
01:09:33,171 --> 01:09:33,831
We're saying,
well,

1394
01:09:33,831 --> 01:09:37,040
you're going to have to go $60,000 in 
debt because you've got to get a college

1395
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:37,874
degree of which you will have no 
guarantee that you will get this high 

1396
01:09:39,591 --> 01:09:40,424
paying job that you were hoping to get 
so that you make lots of money and then 

1397
01:09:42,681 --> 01:09:45,230
you end up wasting your life wondering 
what the hell did I do with myself?

1398
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:46,383
That's a very good point because I think
the system that we have in place is not 

1399
01:09:49,421 --> 01:09:51,460
perfect,
but yet we're not fixing it.

1400
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,750
Right.
We're not changing it.

1401
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:53,613
And College Education is essentially 
subsidized and you have so much money 

1402
01:09:57,210 --> 01:10:00,610
that these kids are in debt with.
By the time they graduate.

1403
01:10:00,611 --> 01:10:01,444
I mean I had a friend who made it 
through medical school and by the time 

1404
01:10:04,361 --> 01:10:05,194
he got out,
he owed more than a quarter million 

1405
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:08,231
dollars.
I was like,

1406
01:10:08,231 --> 01:10:10,570
that is fucking crazy.
And he's like,

1407
01:10:10,571 --> 01:10:14,140
when people talk about doctors and they 
talk about doctors being greedy,

1408
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:15,520
he goes,
you have to understand that.

1409
01:10:15,521 --> 01:10:18,730
So many of them are struggling just to 
stay alive.

1410
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,760
They're struggling just to pay their own
bills and keep the lights on.

1411
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:26,300
The reason why they want to see 20,
30 people a day and just keep pumping in

1412
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:29,210
the numbers and just constantly,
you know,

1413
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:30,243
do whatever they have to do,
whether it's operations or whatever it 

1414
01:10:31,721 --> 01:10:32,010
is.

1415
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:32,843
Yeah.
And that they're not considering the 

1416
01:10:33,881 --> 01:10:34,714
overall health and welfare of these 
people and looking at all these 

1417
01:10:37,421 --> 01:10:38,254
different solutions,
whether it's nutrition or maybe there's 

1418
01:10:39,851 --> 01:10:43,120
a way to avoid surgery or maybe there's 
a way to figure it out.

1419
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:43,963
Always strengthen your body first before
we do this or maybe we all to your diet 

1420
01:10:47,531 --> 01:10:50,620
and maybe not getting enough sleep.
Let's take that into consideration.

1421
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:51,454
And what kind of pills do you want and 
how are they negatively affecting your 

1422
01:10:53,561 --> 01:10:54,880
health?
They don't have have time for that.

1423
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:55,913
They have another person that's waiting 
and then another person that's waiting 

1424
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:59,920
and they have to keep those people 
coming in because they need that money.

1425
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:00,520
Yeah.

1426
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,960
Yeah.
But the bananas it is.

1427
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:06,170
And that's where whether we're talking 
about the cost of education,

1428
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:07,323
um,
or the cost of healthcare for that 

1429
01:11:08,451 --> 01:11:09,020
matter.
When we,

1430
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:09,853
when we look at technology and how we 
can both bring down cost and improve 

1431
01:11:14,881 --> 01:11:16,880
quality in these areas,
um,

1432
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:18,083
I think there's,
there's tremendous opportunity in 

1433
01:11:21,481 --> 01:11:23,380
Hawaii.
There's a pilot program on,

1434
01:11:23,381 --> 01:11:24,214
on the big island right now called 
paramedicine where current Medicare 

1435
01:11:27,841 --> 01:11:28,674
reimbursement laws say that as our emt 
is go out and ambulance to pick up 

1436
01:11:32,311 --> 01:11:33,144
somebody and they will only get 
reimbursed if they pick up that person 

1437
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:41,600
and take them to an emergency room.
So nevermind if that person needs to get

1438
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:44,940
their prescription drugs refilled,
which happens,

1439
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:46,380
they'll call nine,
one one for that.

1440
01:11:46,381 --> 01:11:47,214
They're living out in the boonies 
somewhere and they can't get to where 

1441
01:11:48,661 --> 01:11:53,370
they need to go or if that person needs 
to see a mental health professional or a

1442
01:11:53,371 --> 01:11:55,110
social worker or anything else.

1443
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:59,120
So this idea of paramedicine that we're 
working on trying to build and,

1444
01:11:59,121 --> 01:12:00,270
and actually,
um,

1445
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:02,700
changed in federal policy to help 
support is,

1446
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:04,043
um,
really look out for what does this 

1447
01:12:07,171 --> 01:12:08,004
person actually need and not just shove 
them into this healthcare system that 

1448
01:12:10,651 --> 01:12:14,430
drives up the cost for everyone.
And also use technology to do that.

1449
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:15,241
So I was asking him,
okay,

1450
01:12:15,241 --> 01:12:16,074
so you're not gonna be able to 
physically bring a social worker with 

1451
01:12:18,151 --> 01:12:18,984
you on all these calls,
like that's not how you're going to 

1452
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,880
economize your cost here.
He said,

1453
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:25,650
oh no,
we bring an ipad with us.

1454
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:26,963
So was a social worker at the clinic and
then we can dial them in and they can 

1455
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:33,210
facetime with the person whose house 
that we've gone to,

1456
01:12:33,211 --> 01:12:34,044
if that's the service that they need and
they can start helping connect them to 

1457
01:12:37,141 --> 01:12:40,440
resources.
So that's where you're able to help kind

1458
01:12:40,441 --> 01:12:41,274
of both bring down costs,
but also making sure that we have the 

1459
01:12:44,251 --> 01:12:46,740
services accessible to those who need 
them.

1460
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:47,683
Well that's a fantastic idea just to 
avoid the trips to the doctor for 

1461
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:52,350
rudimentary things.
Right.

1462
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:53,643
But one of the things that Bernie 
Sanders brought up when he was running 

1463
01:12:55,821 --> 01:12:57,180
for president,
and I thought that was very,

1464
01:12:57,770 --> 01:13:02,060
very intriguing,
was the possibility of free education.

1465
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:05,900
And you know,
obviously we have public schools when it

1466
01:13:05,901 --> 01:13:09,290
comes to high school and junior high 
school and all that other stuff.

1467
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:14,590
But the idea of a public full education 
through university to your degree,

1468
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:17,750
do you think that's possible?

1469
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:20,420
Um,
I think you've got the.

1470
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:21,373
I think it's possible,
but I think it doesn't get to the root 

1471
01:13:23,721 --> 01:13:27,230
cause of the problem,
which is the cost of education.

1472
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:30,500
And I think that if you write that 
ticket,

1473
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:35,150
then you are at risk of then these 
education institutions just saying,

1474
01:13:35,151 --> 01:13:35,984
okay,
so if you are guaranteeing x number of 

1475
01:13:39,651 --> 01:13:44,420
dollars for a student to go through and 
get that education,

1476
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:45,883
then we're going to adjust our cost to 
make it meet that amount or if it's a 

1477
01:13:49,581 --> 01:13:52,010
blank check then they'll know that they 
have a blank check.

1478
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:53,520
So we,
we,

1479
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:54,423
we have to,
we have to get to the root cause of 

1480
01:13:56,391 --> 01:13:57,730
these challenges.
Um,

1481
01:13:57,790 --> 01:14:01,390
whether it is education or healthcare,
um,

1482
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,353
we have to get to the root cause of why 
are these costs being driven up so 

1483
01:14:05,211 --> 01:14:07,700
dramatically and not just say,
well,

1484
01:14:07,701 --> 01:14:08,534
we were going to pay for everything 
without actually dealing the fact that 

1485
01:14:12,371 --> 01:14:13,960
things are not affordable as they are.

1486
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:14,973
Well,
how did education get to a point where 

1487
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:17,253
you could go bankrupt with any other 
kind of debt and you're no longer 

1488
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:25,810
required to pay that debt,
so if you have credit card money,

1489
01:14:25,811 --> 01:14:27,580
you lose your house,
whatever it is,

1490
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:31,480
but if you owe money because of a 
college loan,

1491
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:33,620
you owe that money until you're dead.
Yeah.

1492
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:35,133
That is strange.
I mean it's one of the weirder things 

1493
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:42,070
that we have in our culture is that we 
saddle these young,

1494
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:45,640
ambitious people with insurmountable 
debt,

1495
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:49,170
right?
And that there are institutions that are

1496
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:51,810
really making a lot of money off of 
this,

1497
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:54,170
right?
The interest attached to it.

1498
01:14:54,171 --> 01:14:57,440
They become addicted to this money and 
this is a part of the system and they're

1499
01:14:57,441 --> 01:14:58,274
profiting off of it and they don't want 
it to go away and somehow or another 

1500
01:15:00,081 --> 01:15:00,914
they've talked someone into passing 
these laws that make these kids duck 

1501
01:15:07,610 --> 01:15:10,160
with this bill.
No matter what happens in their life.

1502
01:15:10,230 --> 01:15:11,270
Yeah.
You know,

1503
01:15:11,271 --> 01:15:12,520
getting a car accident.
No,

1504
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,330
no longer take care of yourself.
Tough Shit.

1505
01:15:14,331 --> 01:15:15,850
And pay that bill.
I mean,

1506
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:16,880
it's really mafia life.

1507
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:19,870
Yeah.
Back into the financial industry.

1508
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:20,651
Yeah.
It's so,

1509
01:15:20,651 --> 01:15:21,760
it's,
it's really,

1510
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:22,673
um,
when you pull the veil back on kind of 

1511
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:29,020
the crony capitalism that exists in this
country,

1512
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:33,280
then you start to see and connect how it
really impacts people's lives in so many

1513
01:15:33,281 --> 01:15:37,540
different ways and how it affects the 
policies in our country.

1514
01:15:37,710 --> 01:15:38,543
What was Bernie solution for that when 
he wanted to institute some sort of a 

1515
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:46,260
free education system for higher 
education?

1516
01:15:46,261 --> 01:15:47,100
What,
what did he,

1517
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:48,200
how did he envision

1518
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:49,163
I,
and I don't know his bill chapter and 

1519
01:15:50,581 --> 01:15:54,030
verse,
but I believe it was a focused on public

1520
01:15:54,031 --> 01:15:58,140
colleges,
not private institutions and that it was

1521
01:15:58,170 --> 01:16:01,530
by levying some sort of tax on Wall 
Street to pay for it.

1522
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:03,493
Yeah.
That was the big criticism that 

1523
01:16:04,391 --> 01:16:05,710
everything was going to be tax,
tax,

1524
01:16:05,711 --> 01:16:06,491
tax,
tax tax.

1525
01:16:06,491 --> 01:16:10,090
But an inefficient system is going to 
chew up a lot of your tax dollars.

1526
01:16:10,091 --> 01:16:12,340
So people were,
were thinking their hard earned dollars.

1527
01:16:12,341 --> 01:16:13,174
We're going to go to some bureaucracy 
and a bunch of red tape and Horse Shit 

1528
01:16:15,431 --> 01:16:16,264
and too many people that are working,
doing too many different things just to 

1529
01:16:18,851 --> 01:16:20,260
try to keep jobs going.

1530
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:22,040
Yeah.
That's the fear,

1531
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:22,580
right?
Yeah.

1532
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:25,690
That's the big republican fear.
Yeah.

1533
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:27,410
The,
the particular.

1534
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,333
I mean,
you know,

1535
01:16:28,730 --> 01:16:30,380
I think the,
the focus on,

1536
01:16:30,410 --> 01:16:33,640
um,
on Wall Street I think is,

1537
01:16:33,641 --> 01:16:35,900
is a very specific one.
However,

1538
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:40,340
as you're looking at possible funding 
and tax sources.

1539
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:42,110
Um,
but again,

1540
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:47,111
I mean I just point to soundbites can,
can be catch fire easily,

1541
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:49,453
but I'm getting to the root cause of how
we solve some of these problems is 

1542
01:16:53,451 --> 01:16:57,710
really what we need to do a how are we 
delivering education to people?

1543
01:16:57,711 --> 01:17:01,100
Why is it that these colleges,
why is it the cost of education has gone

1544
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:05,210
so far up and really in an,
in an uncontrolled manner?

1545
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:07,020
Um,
we look at healthcare.

1546
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:08,380
Why is it that,
uh,

1547
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:09,523
you know,
prescription drug companies can raise 

1548
01:17:11,331 --> 01:17:12,164
their prices hundreds if not thousands 
of percent on lifesaving medication for 

1549
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:17,900
people.
Um,

1550
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:18,973
why is it that doctors are not required 
to go through any kind of nutrition 

1551
01:17:21,681 --> 01:17:25,970
training as they get their 
certification?

1552
01:17:25,971 --> 01:17:27,740
They go through their,
there are medical school.

1553
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:28,933
When you look at how closely connected 
diet is and what people put into their 

1554
01:17:32,091 --> 01:17:32,924
bodies,
to the kinds of major sicknesses that 

1555
01:17:35,661 --> 01:17:39,110
are rampant in our communities,
like diabetes for example,

1556
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:43,010
you're not seeing that connection where 
you have doctors who were trained even a

1557
01:17:43,011 --> 01:17:43,844
little bit in nutrition and how 
connecting that kind of preventive 

1558
01:17:48,171 --> 01:17:53,000
medicine and using food,
food as medicine is not,

1559
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:56,780
does not even play a partial role in a 
lot of the medicine.

1560
01:17:56,781 --> 01:17:58,340
The Western medicine is delivered today.

1561
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:01,480
It is strange,
but is this,

1562
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:03,333
is this the business of the federal 
government to get involved in how 

1563
01:18:06,551 --> 01:18:08,350
doctors are educated?
I mean,

1564
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:12,250
how do you fix that without getting your
hands into everything?

1565
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:13,323
Because obviously we would like to 
believe that medical schools know more 

1566
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:21,910
about how to raise doctors than you were
I

1567
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:22,853
[inaudible],
but when the government pays a lot of 

1568
01:18:26,831 --> 01:18:27,664
money to help take care of people and 
make sure that they have access to 

1569
01:18:30,611 --> 01:18:32,920
education,
especially those who don't have money.

1570
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:35,133
And so it is,
it is our responsibility to try to do 

1571
01:18:39,821 --> 01:18:43,250
what we can to help improve that system,
um,

1572
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,193
to make it so that it's affordable and 
to look at these preventive health 

1573
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:49,353
measures.
I have yet to get a good answer from 

1574
01:18:51,851 --> 01:18:53,680
anyone in a medical school or in,
in,

1575
01:18:53,681 --> 01:18:56,630
uh,
in that field about why eve,

1576
01:18:56,660 --> 01:18:57,493
I'm not even talking about you have to 
become a licensed nutrition 

1577
01:18:59,711 --> 01:19:00,544
professional.
But just having this basic education 

1578
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:07,420
that will help them better take care of 
people.

1579
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:08,860
Why that doesn't exist?

1580
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:09,943
Well,
it's also bizarre that mean it's such a 

1581
01:19:12,321 --> 01:19:14,810
complicated thing,
especially diet and nutrition.

1582
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:17,420
It's so complicated that even 
nutritionists don't agree.

1583
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:18,853
I mean,
you have extroverts in nutrition that 

1584
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:25,980
I'm having a bunch of debates coming up 
in the future to have them in at the end

1585
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,680
of this month,
a one,

1586
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:28,653
a vegan doctor versus a former Vegan 
Paleo scientist who believes that organ 

1587
01:19:33,801 --> 01:19:37,010
meat and in any eating animal meat is 
the key to health,

1588
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:40,400
health and happiness.
The vegan obviously believes that that's

1589
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:41,660
not the case.
And you know,

1590
01:19:41,661 --> 01:19:44,180
there's people that believe in high 
carbohydrate,

1591
01:19:44,181 --> 01:19:45,014
low fat,
low carbohydrate diets that are out 

1592
01:19:47,391 --> 01:19:48,680
there.
It's so hard.

1593
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:53,950
And then there's the reality that every 
person physiologically very.

1594
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:55,170
Yeah.
Oh absolutely.

1595
01:19:55,171 --> 01:19:57,420
But I mean,
I'm just talking about like the basics.

1596
01:19:57,421 --> 01:19:58,500
Sugar.
Yes.

1597
01:19:58,710 --> 01:19:59,790
Alcohol,
yes.

1598
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:00,800
Yeah.
And there,

1599
01:20:00,801 --> 01:20:01,950
there are folks,
um,

1600
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:06,660
some friends of mine in Waimanalo in 
Hawaii who have a little cafe and a farm

1601
01:20:06,661 --> 01:20:09,870
and their is to be able to feed healthy 
food to their community.

1602
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:15,260
And so one of the things that they do is
they identify people on the island who,

1603
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,013
you know are dealing with like 30 plus 
year old guy who's dealing with major 

1604
01:20:22,381 --> 01:20:27,381
heart failures already and who's obese 
and dealing with weight and diabetes and

1605
01:20:28,111 --> 01:20:31,530
all these other issues and helping 
people like him change her diet.

1606
01:20:31,531 --> 01:20:36,090
So they provide free meals to them for,
I think it was like three months.

1607
01:20:36,150 --> 01:20:36,983
And they have a doctor who's supervising
and monitoring what the effect on their 

1608
01:20:41,071 --> 01:20:42,630
body is.
And uh,

1609
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:43,583
my friend Malia,
she told me that one of these guys who 

1610
01:20:44,941 --> 01:20:46,320
came in,
she's like,

1611
01:20:46,321 --> 01:20:46,880
you know,
you shouldn't,

1612
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,920
you should try to eat more salad in your
diet.

1613
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:51,390
You try to eat at least once a day,
you should have a salad.

1614
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:52,411
And he's like,
oh,

1615
01:20:52,411 --> 01:20:54,990
no problem,
eight Mac salad every day,

1616
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:58,540
like Mayonnaise,
macaroni,

1617
01:20:58,541 --> 01:20:59,910
Salad,
Salad.

1618
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:03,250
Thought that was legitimately that.
He's like,

1619
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,060
oh yeah,
no problem.

1620
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:05,740
Like he really meant it was like,
no,

1621
01:21:05,741 --> 01:21:10,720
probably not salad everyday as a staple.
Right.

1622
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:12,410
Wow.
He thought that's,

1623
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:14,830
I mean,
that's what I'm talking about,

1624
01:21:14,831 --> 01:21:18,590
the basic level of just like eat foods 
and,

1625
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,600
you know,
cutting out sugar and you know,

1626
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:23,290
minimizing fried foods,
like those kinds of things.

1627
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:25,750
Um,
we can't take for granted that everybody

1628
01:21:25,751 --> 01:21:27,140
just knows this,
right?

1629
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:30,070
Especially when you're brought up in a 
certain way or certain kinds of culture,

1630
01:21:30,071 --> 01:21:31,600
whatever,
that,

1631
01:21:31,601 --> 01:21:34,510
that may not be something that you're 
taught and,

1632
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:37,200
but that,
that really does taxpayers,

1633
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:39,910
is that you're going to have less health
care costs.

1634
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:42,250
If you're preventing people from getting
sick,

1635
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:47,940
then you are lowering the cost of,
of highly escalating healthcare.

1636
01:21:48,730 --> 01:21:49,563
Right?
And we're also looking out for each 

1637
01:21:50,651 --> 01:21:53,270
other because there's information that 
we're distributing that listen,

1638
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:54,183
you want to have your loved ones live 
longer and be healthier and not 

1639
01:21:56,691 --> 01:21:59,050
improving quality.
Oh my gosh,

1640
01:21:59,051 --> 01:22:00,040
you know,
just the time,

1641
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:03,750
get with your family and with your kids 
and being mobile and getting,

1642
01:22:03,751 --> 01:22:04,584
getting out and around and,
and so you using the example of these 

1643
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:08,273
people in Waimanalo,
that's what they've seen with the folks 

1644
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:10,524
that they've been able to help is it's 
about education and like here's how you 

1645
01:22:13,441 --> 01:22:16,650
could eat in a,
in a healthy way that's good for you.

1646
01:22:16,651 --> 01:22:19,710
And seeing how that is impacting those 
individuals.

1647
01:22:19,711 --> 01:22:20,544
Personal health and their families has 
been really life changing for some of 

1648
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:23,950
these guys.
No.

1649
01:22:23,951 --> 01:22:26,320
As a congresswoman,
what are the bottlenecks?

1650
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:28,370
Are you seeing that you,
you,

1651
01:22:28,371 --> 01:22:33,010
you see in the system that you would 
like to change or fix?

1652
01:22:34,710 --> 01:22:38,340
A civil liberties is one that um,
I have,

1653
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:39,293
I have and continue to be focused on and
an area where there is bipartisan 

1654
01:22:42,901 --> 01:22:44,490
support.
Uh,

1655
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:49,520
when you look at a lot of the abuses 
that we have seen and continue to see in

1656
01:22:49,981 --> 01:22:54,540
agencies like the NSA and,
and in the post Patriot Act world where,

1657
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:56,940
um,
laws were passed,

1658
01:22:56,970 --> 01:23:01,110
licensing warrantless spying on 
Americans,

1659
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:03,000
um,
that,

1660
01:23:03,001 --> 01:23:07,660
that is an area where we still need to 
make a lot of changes.

1661
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:10,630
Uh,
criminal justice reform is another,

1662
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:13,360
and this is one where uniquely right 
now,

1663
01:23:13,361 --> 01:23:17,410
I think there's a moment in time where 
you have organizations like the Acl,

1664
01:23:17,411 --> 01:23:21,250
you partnering with the Koch Brothers,
very conservative Koch brothers,

1665
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:22,660
uh,
coming at,

1666
01:23:22,661 --> 01:23:27,661
at and supporting the same pieces of 
legislation to end the federal marijuana

1667
01:23:28,691 --> 01:23:31,990
prohibition to deal with sentencing 
reform,

1668
01:23:31,991 --> 01:23:32,824
to deal with prison reform and to make 
it so that we're not constantly cycling 

1669
01:23:38,201 --> 01:23:39,034
these same people through our prison 
systems and that we're not throwing 

1670
01:23:42,551 --> 01:23:45,550
people into already overcrowded prisons,
uh,

1671
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:46,900
who have no business being there.

1672
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:49,770
Yeah,
those are really important points.

1673
01:23:49,890 --> 01:23:50,180
And,
um,

1674
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:52,150
I'm glad you brought that up.
Um,

1675
01:23:52,290 --> 01:23:53,123
I've heard argument that the wire 
tapping and that the surveillance 

1676
01:23:57,301 --> 01:24:01,560
program is necessary to prevent 
terrorist activity.

1677
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:03,840
Does that make any sense to you?

1678
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:05,830
Uh,
it is,

1679
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:09,480
it is the most often used argument.
Um,

1680
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:15,930
the point here is that it is illegal to 
spy on Americans without a warrant.

1681
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:19,800
So if you have somebody that,
you know,

1682
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,673
has raised some level of suspicion than 
as a law enforcement officer agency you 

1683
01:24:25,121 --> 01:24:26,090
need,
we're,

1684
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:28,780
we're protected by our constitution in 
this way,

1685
01:24:28,850 --> 01:24:29,683
right where you have to do the tough 
work of building your evidence and 

1686
01:24:32,531 --> 01:24:33,364
actually getting a warrant to do this.
But there have been a example after 

1687
01:24:38,681 --> 01:24:43,681
example how this has been grossly abused
and how,

1688
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:46,871
uh,
you know,

1689
01:24:46,871 --> 01:24:47,704
whether it's our cell phone records that
were being gathered and mass by the NSA 

1690
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:59,490
or other things we're seeing that 
because of the Patriot Act,

1691
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:01,753
uh,
they're there the loopholes that have 

1692
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:05,470
been created that have allowed these 
agencies to exploit that.

1693
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:09,670
There's also some weird rules where like
if you get pulled over,

1694
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:12,880
they can't ask you for your pin number 
for your phone,

1695
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:16,540
but they can use your thumbprint to 
access your phone.

1696
01:25:16,590 --> 01:25:18,880
Hmm.
I didn't know about that one.

1697
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:21,610
See if that's accurate.
Um,

1698
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:22,563
I'm pretty sure it is.
I believe it pertains to whatever the 

1699
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:26,704
crime is.
I don't think they could do it if you 

1700
01:25:28,181 --> 01:25:29,014
get caught speeding,
but I think if they believe that you're 

1701
01:25:31,061 --> 01:25:33,760
involved in something that may or may 
not be a felony,

1702
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:35,073
that they can check your phone and 
there's actually these devices that 

1703
01:25:38,081 --> 01:25:38,914
they'd been selling to police 
departments that allow them to crack 

1704
01:25:41,141 --> 01:25:44,210
into iphones,
which are supposedly incredibly.

1705
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:45,520
I'm sure you've heard of this.
Yeah,

1706
01:25:45,930 --> 01:25:47,560
I mean why else would they have that?
Unless.

1707
01:25:47,561 --> 01:25:48,394
I mean if you.
If you need a warrant to access 

1708
01:25:49,991 --> 01:25:50,824
someone's Iphone,
I mean you're going to go to whatever 

1709
01:25:53,350 --> 01:25:57,350
federal jurisdiction and that's involved
in that.

1710
01:25:57,730 --> 01:25:58,563
They would have some sort of device,
but police departments are looking to 

1711
01:26:01,001 --> 01:26:02,860
get this technology.
How's it go?

1712
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:04,190
I'm accurate.
Yeah.

1713
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:05,023
Okay.
So they can access your phone with your 

1714
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:10,010
thumbprint so they can go give me your 
hand.

1715
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:11,150
Tulsi.
Bam.

1716
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:12,920
And then they got into your phone.
Oh,

1717
01:26:12,921 --> 01:26:15,820
look at pictures of you naked.
I'm not to ignore those and I'm going to

1718
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:16,663
look at this.
Please can force you to use your 

1719
01:26:17,601 --> 01:26:19,430
fingerprint to unlock your phone.
Like what?

1720
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:21,070
How is that strange?
Who were this?

1721
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:21,950
No Difference?
Well,

1722
01:26:21,951 --> 01:26:22,784
the problem is,
and this is good and bad cops are 

1723
01:26:25,791 --> 01:26:26,890
people.
Okay.

1724
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:31,960
There just you and I and they're just 
folks that have a very difficult job and

1725
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:33,104
a very high level responsibility.
But why would you allow them to decide 

1726
01:26:38,421 --> 01:26:39,254
whether or not they can go into 
someone's personal property and view 

1727
01:26:41,931 --> 01:26:45,050
their information and look at their 
emails or their text messages and make a

1728
01:26:45,051 --> 01:26:45,884
determination as to whether or not this 
person is involved in illegal activity 

1729
01:26:47,901 --> 01:26:50,420
without a judge and a search warrant.
Right?

1730
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:52,340
That's crazy.
And without cause.

1731
01:26:52,430 --> 01:26:53,263
Yeah.
I don't know if this is post Patriot 

1732
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:56,053
Act.
Is this because of this or is this just 

1733
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:01,430
one of the things that happen sometimes 
is that technology accelerates at a rate

1734
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:05,720
where we don't have laws that are 
pertinent to that technology.

1735
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:07,273
No problem.

1736
01:27:07,570 --> 01:27:08,403
Um,
and there there's some legislation that 

1737
01:27:09,441 --> 01:27:11,520
we've worked on,
um,

1738
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:13,273
that we are continuing to try to get 
past to try to help get that technology 

1739
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:18,890
to help get the laws caught up with 
where we are today.

1740
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:19,920
Uh,
and there,

1741
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:22,010
there's one bill that we have that deals
with,

1742
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:24,290
with emails,
for example,

1743
01:27:24,650 --> 01:27:25,590
where,
um,

1744
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:26,870
you know,
the car it is,

1745
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,210
it's against the law to open up someone 
else's mail,

1746
01:27:30,590 --> 01:27:33,440
but it's not necessarily against a lot 
of open up someone else's email.

1747
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:38,960
That seems crazy because the law,
the law was written back when,

1748
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:39,800
you know,
Ha,

1749
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:40,633
whatever handwritten letters or letters 
sent through the US Postal Service was 

1750
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:49,310
the only way people communicate and it 
has not been updated to this day.

1751
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,260
That seems crazy.
Yeah.

1752
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,710
What are you feelings on private 
prisons?

1753
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:56,893
Um,
when you're making money off of keeping 

1754
01:28:01,101 --> 01:28:04,070
people in prison than you have a 
serious,

1755
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:05,510
you have a serious problem.

1756
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:06,373
The fact that we have a criminal justice
system that is so broken that we're 

1757
01:28:08,871 --> 01:28:09,704
allowing these corporations to make 
money off of keeping their prison beds 

1758
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:14,533
filled.
We are doing a disservice to those 

1759
01:28:17,931 --> 01:28:19,310
people,
to our communities,

1760
01:28:19,311 --> 01:28:20,081
our family,
and,

1761
01:28:20,081 --> 01:28:24,170
and every taxpayer who's paying money 
for these private prisons.

1762
01:28:24,710 --> 01:28:26,780
I mean,
it seems an obvious conflict of interest

1763
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:28,790
exactly that you have.
No,

1764
01:28:28,791 --> 01:28:31,520
you have no incentive whatsoever to 
actually,

1765
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:33,560
um,
you know,

1766
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:35,270
help rehabilitate people,
help,

1767
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:38,030
help provide people with transitional 
training,

1768
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:40,550
with the drug Rehab,
with,

1769
01:28:40,551 --> 01:28:41,384
with all of these other things that can 
help people who have been incarcerated 

1770
01:28:44,451 --> 01:28:48,080
for one reason or another leave and 
never come back.

1771
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,080
And that's one of the bills that,
that one of the,

1772
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:51,973
one of the good news stories that 
actually has happened recently in 

1773
01:28:54,081 --> 01:28:57,260
Congress was we pass this bill called 
the first step act,

1774
01:28:57,690 --> 01:28:58,523
um,
that deal specifically with this prison 

1775
01:29:00,291 --> 01:29:05,291
reform issue to help make sure that 
those who don't belong in prison,

1776
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:08,550
like nonviolent drug offenders don't go 
there in the first place.

1777
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:09,893
Um,
and to make it so that those who are 

1778
01:29:11,401 --> 01:29:15,200
there and those who are the returning,
um,

1779
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,460
uh,
you know,

1780
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:18,583
there were the returning inmates are,
we're actually addressing what is it 

1781
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:26,580
that is that you need to make so you 
don't keep coming back.

1782
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:27,923
Uh,
and that was something that faced some 

1783
01:29:29,671 --> 01:29:31,680
opposition on both sides of the aisle.
But again,

1784
01:29:31,681 --> 01:29:35,040
it's one of those examples where when 
you focus on,

1785
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:35,874
okay,
we may come at this from different 

1786
01:29:37,111 --> 01:29:39,060
directions.
Like some folks are more concerned about

1787
01:29:39,061 --> 01:29:39,894
the social cost and the impact on 
families and communities and how you're 

1788
01:29:42,841 --> 01:29:43,674
criminalizing people.
Others are more concerned about the 

1789
01:29:45,541 --> 01:29:49,500
fiscal impact and how much money we're 
spending on these people cycling through

1790
01:29:49,501 --> 01:29:53,190
our prisons regardless.
We both want the same outcome,

1791
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:54,353
which is less people in our prisons and 
bringing down the costs both economic 

1792
01:29:58,261 --> 01:29:59,094
and social.
And so that was a bill that we passed a 

1793
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:03,660
through the house at sitting before the 
Senate right now,

1794
01:30:03,661 --> 01:30:04,494
but it has support from the White House 
and ironically there is a Republican 

1795
01:30:08,101 --> 01:30:12,090
senator in the Senate who is the number 
one opposition against this bill.

1796
01:30:12,091 --> 01:30:14,040
It passed like,
I don't know,

1797
01:30:14,041 --> 01:30:17,580
there were over 300 members of the house
who voted for it.

1798
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:18,870
Uh,
so there's,

1799
01:30:19,230 --> 01:30:21,720
there's some hope there,
but there's some work to be done in that

1800
01:30:21,721 --> 01:30:22,080
area.

1801
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,000
How did we get to the situation?
How did,

1802
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:24,863
how did this whole private prison thing 
happened before people even realized it 

1803
01:30:27,951 --> 01:30:28,784
took place?

1804
01:30:29,230 --> 01:30:31,410
You know,
I don't know the exact history of,

1805
01:30:31,411 --> 01:30:32,244
of who made it happen or who you know 
allowed for this government contract to 

1806
01:30:37,151 --> 01:30:37,984
take place.
But I think the sick part about it is 

1807
01:30:40,001 --> 01:30:40,834
that you have people who recognize that 
they could make money off of people who 

1808
01:30:44,511 --> 01:30:45,970
were going to jail.

1809
01:30:46,370 --> 01:30:49,640
I'm sure you're aware of that 
Pennsylvania judge who sentenced,

1810
01:30:49,670 --> 01:30:51,020
who was,
um,

1811
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:53,593
he was irresponsibly and a wrongfully 
sentencing young people to jail for 

1812
01:30:59,271 --> 01:31:00,830
profit.
Yeah.

1813
01:31:00,831 --> 01:31:02,330
And so people would think,
well,

1814
01:31:02,450 --> 01:31:04,310
you know,
you're never going to see that.

1815
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:05,590
That's not going to be,
that's,

1816
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:06,463
that couldn't be real.
But this is one of the real problems 

1817
01:31:08,751 --> 01:31:09,584
with profit,
with the idea that you can make profit 

1818
01:31:11,601 --> 01:31:14,090
off of having people in yourself.
Yeah.

1819
01:31:14,690 --> 01:31:15,523
Having people in your cell.
And when you look at all of the other 

1820
01:31:17,631 --> 01:31:18,780
impacts of that,
and,

1821
01:31:19,130 --> 01:31:19,963
and this is,
this is what I often talk about when we 

1822
01:31:21,351 --> 01:31:24,470
talk about ending the federal marijuana 
prohibition,

1823
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:30,160
is look at how it is impacting the lives
of those individuals who will not have a

1824
01:31:30,681 --> 01:31:33,440
criminal record and follow them 
everywhere.

1825
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:36,170
Look at how it's impacting their 
children,

1826
01:31:36,710 --> 01:31:40,820
their family members,
their opportunities for their future and

1827
01:31:40,821 --> 01:31:44,360
how these impacts are often very,
very long reaching.

1828
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:45,223
And I'm an impact a lot of these other 
social systems and programs that exist 

1829
01:31:51,410 --> 01:31:55,640
and how much more prevalent these 
arrests are than most people realize.

1830
01:31:56,350 --> 01:31:57,183
Yeah.
And then there's the economic windfall 

1831
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:01,900
that takes place when you legalize it.
Right.

1832
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:03,333
That's the only thing that you're seeing
where these states are voting for it 

1833
01:32:05,501 --> 01:32:06,334
because they realize there's massive 
amounts of tax dollars that they can 

1834
01:32:08,021 --> 01:32:09,520
make.
I mean,

1835
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:10,473
I think Colorado is 39 percent tax on 
recreational marijuana and people are 

1836
01:32:14,831 --> 01:32:15,530
like,
okay.

1837
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:16,363
Yeah.
Like they just pay it because it's even 

1838
01:32:18,581 --> 01:32:21,280
then it's still not that expensive.
That's true.

1839
01:32:21,790 --> 01:32:22,623
Yeah.

1840
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:23,630
To speak of.
I mean,

1841
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:24,663
you know,
the people who are actually benefiting 

1842
01:32:26,901 --> 01:32:27,721
from the.
Especially,

1843
01:32:27,721 --> 01:32:28,554
you know,
these kids with epilepsy and those with 

1844
01:32:29,691 --> 01:32:31,860
other medical disorders.
Um,

1845
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:36,500
I've met with families in states like 
Iowa for example,

1846
01:32:36,810 --> 01:32:40,010
a met with families and met with their 
kids who,

1847
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:42,800
you know,
they are breaking both state and federal

1848
01:32:42,801 --> 01:32:47,510
law in Iowa where even cbd products are 
not legal.

1849
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:51,290
And so they're having to find ways to 
get it there and they're trying to fight

1850
01:32:51,291 --> 01:32:53,450
this within their own state to change 
the laws.

1851
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:55,730
But um,
you know,

1852
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:56,683
these people who consider themselves 
conservative Republicans are talking 

1853
01:33:00,081 --> 01:33:02,840
about this issue that they feel is a 
lifesaving issue for their children.

1854
01:33:03,330 --> 01:33:04,163
Well,
once you see people that have cancer 

1855
01:33:05,941 --> 01:33:06,774
that can't eat and they're going through
chemotherapy and you realize that there 

1856
01:33:10,631 --> 01:33:11,464
is maybe one of the only things you can 
give someone that given their appetite 

1857
01:33:14,371 --> 01:33:19,371
back when you see children that have 
severe autism and one of the only things

1858
01:33:19,591 --> 01:33:22,470
that can stop their seizures is medical 
marijuana.

1859
01:33:22,471 --> 01:33:24,540
I mean,
do you realize there's so many different

1860
01:33:24,541 --> 01:33:25,374
things that we could help people with.
It's not just about getting high and 

1861
01:33:29,690 --> 01:33:30,523
there is personal freedom issues that 
you really shouldn't be able to tell 

1862
01:33:32,761 --> 01:33:33,594
someone that they can go get whiskey but
they can't get marijuana because it's 

1863
01:33:35,971 --> 01:33:37,170
foolish.
Absolutely.

1864
01:33:37,230 --> 01:33:39,700
And it's ancient.
I mean it's one of those really were.

1865
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:40,573
We're stuck with these legacy laws that 
were perpetrated by people who were 

1866
01:33:43,921 --> 01:33:48,780
doing it just for profit and mean.
It's not that this is a grand mystery.

1867
01:33:48,781 --> 01:33:50,020
The,
the writing is.

1868
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:51,240
I mean,
you could read it all.

1869
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:52,093
Yeah,
we know exactly how it all took place 

1870
01:33:53,341 --> 01:33:54,174
and we know why prohibition was enacted 
and it wasn't enacted to save the 

1871
01:33:57,241 --> 01:33:58,074
public.
It wasn't inactive because we were 

1872
01:33:58,831 --> 01:34:01,350
really worried about people,
just people trying to profit.

1873
01:34:01,410 --> 01:34:04,230
That's exactly right.
And the same thing is happening now with

1874
01:34:04,231 --> 01:34:09,231
this opioid epidemic,
how there are states that have legalized

1875
01:34:09,661 --> 01:34:13,020
either whether it's just medical or full
legalization,

1876
01:34:13,410 --> 01:34:14,243
there has proven to be a direct 
correlation to a drastic reduction in 

1877
01:34:17,611 --> 01:34:22,350
opioid related deaths in those states 
where people have access,

1878
01:34:22,351 --> 01:34:27,351
again either to medical or nonmedical 
use of marijuana and you see it.

1879
01:34:29,190 --> 01:34:30,480
You wonder,
okay,

1880
01:34:30,481 --> 01:34:33,720
if we know this and every one of the 
leaders in this country are so concerned

1881
01:34:33,721 --> 01:34:37,350
about this opioid epidemic,
why hasn't this been brought forward?

1882
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:39,773
You learn about the prescription drug 
companies who make a lot of these 

1883
01:34:42,841 --> 01:34:43,674
opioids who are now making the other 
prescription drugs to help wean people 

1884
01:34:47,161 --> 01:34:50,850
off of the opioids.
And so they're making money on both ends

1885
01:34:50,910 --> 01:34:53,340
of the spectrum without really any care 
for the person.

1886
01:34:53,850 --> 01:34:56,910
They're uh,
and their welfare and their wellbeing.

1887
01:34:56,911 --> 01:34:59,490
And people are.
People are dying,

1888
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:00,470
their lives are being ruined,

1889
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:01,333
buy it women.
There's also things that are federally 

1890
01:35:03,071 --> 01:35:05,180
legal,
like federally illegal,

1891
01:35:05,181 --> 01:35:06,014
like Ibogaine,
which has an incredible result ratio in 

1892
01:35:10,491 --> 01:35:13,430
terms of getting people to kick 
addictions,

1893
01:35:13,431 --> 01:35:16,280
whether it's alcohol,
heroin,

1894
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:20,270
pills.
There's clinics in Mexico that people go

1895
01:35:20,271 --> 01:35:21,104
to on a regular basis to take this one 
psychedelic medicine that's been shown 

1896
01:35:25,731 --> 01:35:28,880
to have radical results.
It's not killing people yet.

1897
01:35:28,881 --> 01:35:29,714
It's extremely illegal.
It's a schedule one drug in America and 

1898
01:35:32,361 --> 01:35:35,750
it's.
It's one of the best examples.

1899
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:37,580
I mean,
they're also using psilocybin.

1900
01:35:37,581 --> 01:35:38,414
I mean there was a John Hopkins study.
There's several studies that they're 

1901
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:41,533
doing right now that they're trying to 
show that there's a direct correlation 

1902
01:35:43,941 --> 01:35:44,774
between use of Siliciden in these 
clinicals situations where they're 

1903
01:35:50,510 --> 01:35:52,610
curing cigarettes,
heroin,

1904
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:53,773
all these different addictions with 
different psychedelic drugs that are 

1905
01:35:58,281 --> 01:36:01,070
scheduled.
One interest is a lot of work being done

1906
01:36:01,071 --> 01:36:01,904
right now.
Maps is involved with one thing that 

1907
01:36:04,401 --> 01:36:08,390
they're doing that's helping a 
tremendous amount of soldiers and people

1908
01:36:08,391 --> 01:36:09,224
with ptsd is with Mtma is assisted Mtma 
therapy and there's a lot of these that 

1909
01:36:16,881 --> 01:36:17,714
are being explored now where people had 
demonized these particular drugs or 

1910
01:36:21,411 --> 01:36:25,610
plants and they were thought to be 
something that would ruin your life.

1911
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:26,573
Another really realizing no,
these like many things can be used or 

1912
01:36:30,291 --> 01:36:34,130
abused and that there's solutions for a 
lot of our problems,

1913
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:35,743
but there's a lot of resistance to this.
There's a lot of resistance in 

1914
01:36:37,761 --> 01:36:38,594
particular from.
I mean the resistance about cbd is one 

1915
01:36:41,301 --> 01:36:44,660
of the dumbest ones of all time because 
cbd is addictive,

1916
01:36:44,930 --> 01:36:46,610
nontoxic,
not her end.

1917
01:36:46,670 --> 01:36:51,050
Massively beneficial to so many people,
whether it's helping them with anxiety,

1918
01:36:51,710 --> 01:36:54,020
alleviation of pain and stress.
I mean,

1919
01:36:54,021 --> 01:36:56,420
I even got Ted nugent on it.
Yeah.

1920
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:57,433
Ted.
Ted's never done anything with anything 

1921
01:36:59,361 --> 01:37:03,890
that had anything to do with hamper 
marijuana and he's got bad knees,

1922
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:06,710
so I got to rub and cbd lotion on his 
knees and he was like,

1923
01:37:06,711 --> 01:37:07,790
this stuff's a miracle.
I'm like,

1924
01:37:07,791 --> 01:37:09,920
yeah,
here we go.

1925
01:37:09,921 --> 01:37:10,754
I mean,
if you could talk Ted nugent into using 

1926
01:37:11,631 --> 01:37:13,120
cbd,
there's,

1927
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,480
there's,
there's hope for the world,

1928
01:37:15,090 --> 01:37:16,110
but you just mentioned,
I mean,

1929
01:37:16,111 --> 01:37:18,720
whether it's cbd and hemp is another 
example.

1930
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:20,910
That's something that we're trying to do
in Hawaii.

1931
01:37:20,911 --> 01:37:21,744
I think a Kentucky,
I think there's another state that's a 

1932
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:24,910
leader in this.
Slowly

1933
01:37:24,910 --> 01:37:26,500
but surely the doors opening up with 
that,

1934
01:37:26,501 --> 01:37:29,590
when they realize it's not psychoactive,
it's incredibly beneficial.

1935
01:37:29,591 --> 01:37:32,560
Whether it's for food,
whether it's for textiles,

1936
01:37:32,561 --> 01:37:35,620
whether that's for oil.
I mean there's so many benefits.

1937
01:37:35,621 --> 01:37:36,454
I mean you can.
There's a thing called hempcrete where 

1938
01:37:38,231 --> 01:37:40,400
they're making concrete concrete at a 
hand.

1939
01:37:40,401 --> 01:37:43,300
I've heard about some lighter,
incredibly durable,

1940
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:44,313
flame resistant.
There's so many benefits to it and it's 

1941
01:37:46,961 --> 01:37:50,410
so economically viable.
It's so cheap.

1942
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,960
It's a weed.
It grows up.

1943
01:37:52,961 --> 01:37:55,090
I don't know if you ever really felt a 
hemp stalk.

1944
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:56,093
It's one of the most bizarre things 
because it is as hard as this oak and 

1945
01:37:59,161 --> 01:38:01,620
it's as light as styrofoam.
It's so weird.

1946
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:03,090
It's such a.
it's an alien.

1947
01:38:03,091 --> 01:38:05,040
Plants are very strange plant.
Wow.

1948
01:38:05,370 --> 01:38:06,203
But you know,
demonized for so long and one of the 

1949
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:13,430
things that's kept it from being 
economically viable and it's just people

1950
01:38:13,621 --> 01:38:18,150
that don't want it to become a part of 
the competition,

1951
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:21,750
they just don't want to compete with it 
with whatever they're profiting from,

1952
01:38:21,870 --> 01:38:25,560
whether it's the people that are selling
pain pills are the people that are using

1953
01:38:25,561 --> 01:38:26,011
it for.
I mean,

1954
01:38:26,011 --> 01:38:28,680
it was initially made illegal because of
paper.

1955
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:29,813
William Randolph hearst got involved in 
it because he had paper mills and you 

1956
01:38:32,911 --> 01:38:34,380
know,
he also owned newspaper.

1957
01:38:34,390 --> 01:38:35,223
So we started demonizing it to get 
people to think that if we made hemp 

1958
01:38:38,191 --> 01:38:39,024
legal,
we were going to have people running 

1959
01:38:40,231 --> 01:38:43,110
around on the marijuana Kellen people 
and jumping out of windows.

1960
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:43,690
Yeah,

1961
01:38:43,690 --> 01:38:45,710
that's crazy.
We have A.

1962
01:38:45,730 --> 01:38:48,670
I'm working with a Republican from 
Florida named Carlos Curbelo.

1963
01:38:48,671 --> 01:38:49,504
We just introduced a bill to essentially
commissioned a study by the National 

1964
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:58,070
Academy of Science made up of objective,
um,

1965
01:38:58,810 --> 01:38:59,643
reports and other studies that have been
done from states that have already 

1966
01:39:01,690 --> 01:39:04,150
legalized to one extent or another,
uh,

1967
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:09,240
marijuana to compile a fact,
an independent fact based report for the

1968
01:39:10,631 --> 01:39:12,970
federal government on,
um,

1969
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:13,863
what,
what has come about in those states in 

1970
01:39:15,941 --> 01:39:17,320
every respect,
uh,

1971
01:39:17,390 --> 01:39:18,223
whether you're talking about healthcare 
economy or criminal justice and law 

1972
01:39:20,110 --> 01:39:21,400
enforcement,
every single thing,

1973
01:39:21,430 --> 01:39:24,380
look at this in a very diverse way.
And,

1974
01:39:24,410 --> 01:39:25,243
and to have this entity do it that,
that sits just that sits outside of the 

1975
01:39:29,351 --> 01:39:30,184
federal government because the challenge
that we keep coming up against both at 

1976
01:39:33,191 --> 01:39:35,770
the federal level as well as at the 
state level in some cases,

1977
01:39:35,771 --> 01:39:36,341
is they say,
well,

1978
01:39:36,341 --> 01:39:41,341
there are no studies that show the 
benefits of what goodwill come about.

1979
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:44,133
If you end the federal marijuana 
prohibition as one example in Hawaii 

1980
01:39:47,530 --> 01:39:48,363
just recently,
the state legislature house and Senate 

1981
01:39:49,930 --> 01:39:54,930
overwhelmingly passed a bill to allow 
opiod addiction to be added to,

1982
01:39:55,850 --> 01:39:56,683
um,
the acceptable things that medical 

1983
01:39:59,141 --> 01:39:59,974
marijuana can treat.
So even though medical marijuana is 

1984
01:40:01,991 --> 01:40:05,260
legal in Hawaii,
there is a limited list of,

1985
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:06,233
you know,
the ailments or whatever that you can 

1986
01:40:08,620 --> 01:40:11,110
prove your eligibility.
OPIOID addiction is not.

1987
01:40:11,111 --> 01:40:13,360
One of them.
Legislature said it should be,

1988
01:40:13,390 --> 01:40:14,223
which I agree it should be,
but it was vetoed by the governor who 

1989
01:40:16,571 --> 01:40:17,650
said,
well,

1990
01:40:18,730 --> 01:40:19,563
those studies aren't proving that this 
will help those who are opioid addicts 

1991
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:28,540
and there is a bureaucratic process that
takes a really long time.

1992
01:40:28,541 --> 01:40:30,040
If people really want this to happen,

1993
01:40:31,290 --> 01:40:32,123
what are the other things that are of 
concern to you as a congresswoman that 

1994
01:40:36,601 --> 01:40:37,434
you're seeing not addressed or that are 
somehow or another still in place when 

1995
01:40:41,161 --> 01:40:42,060
you feel like they should have?

1996
01:40:42,630 --> 01:40:43,730
Do you know there's,
there's,

1997
01:40:44,230 --> 01:40:45,063
there's,
there's a long laundry list of issues 

1998
01:40:46,501 --> 01:40:50,910
and I think you can go through each of 
the major issues that a lot of folks are

1999
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:54,340
concerned about and pick those apart and
say,

2000
01:40:54,341 --> 01:40:55,174
hey,
here are the things that we need to 

2001
01:40:55,811 --> 01:41:00,260
address and improve in each of those.
But I think the,

2002
01:41:00,261 --> 01:41:01,094
the conversation that I hope more people
start having is about how w why aren't 

2003
01:41:06,521 --> 01:41:09,650
these things being fixed or addressed 
and that's,

2004
01:41:09,870 --> 01:41:10,703
that speaks directly to people's 
unwillingness to actually talk to each 

2005
01:41:16,721 --> 01:41:17,554
other to stop demonizing each other 
because you're from the other camp and 

2006
01:41:20,351 --> 01:41:24,250
actually engage based on our common 
mission of serving the people,

2007
01:41:24,610 --> 01:41:26,760
serving the people of this country.
And you know,

2008
01:41:26,770 --> 01:41:27,603
that's something I look back to during 
my time in uniform serving in the army 

2009
01:41:31,361 --> 01:41:33,820
national guard.
You got diverse people,

2010
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,920
diverse opinions,
diverse ideas.

2011
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:37,420
But ultimately,
you know,

2012
01:41:37,421 --> 01:41:42,400
we were the same flag on our uniform and
we are focused singularly on,

2013
01:41:42,401 --> 01:41:43,234
on that same purpose and mission.
And unfortunately that's what we're 

2014
01:41:46,721 --> 01:41:47,554
missing a lot of in Congress is the 
hyper partisanship and the political 

2015
01:41:50,831 --> 01:41:51,664
winds to often take precedence over the 
reason why people in our districts hire 

2016
01:41:57,521 --> 01:41:58,354
us to go and work there.
And a lot of that comes from not having 

2017
01:42:01,871 --> 01:42:05,290
a basic level of respect or Aloha for 
each other as people.

2018
01:42:05,950 --> 01:42:07,660
And instead just saying,
hey,

2019
01:42:07,661 --> 01:42:10,870
it's us against them.
Pick your label.

2020
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:15,050
And that's where the battles are fought.
And,

2021
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:18,190
and who suffers as a result of this,
the people who are suffering,

2022
01:42:18,191 --> 01:42:19,024
who are dealing with a lot of the 
challenges that we've been talking 

2023
01:42:20,531 --> 01:42:22,450
about.
So that's something that you know,

2024
01:42:22,451 --> 01:42:23,284
I try to bring,
I try to bring Hawaii's Aloha to 

2025
01:42:24,851 --> 01:42:25,684
Washington to try to bring that through 
in the work that I'm trying to do on 

2026
01:42:29,051 --> 01:42:31,900
these different issues,
in the conversations that we're having.

2027
01:42:31,901 --> 01:42:32,734
Sometimes it means you talk with people 
who who you disagree with or you may 

2028
01:42:36,131 --> 01:42:40,000
have different ideas than they have 
about how you solve these problems.

2029
01:42:40,001 --> 01:42:42,280
But if even if you're able to come 
together on one thing,

2030
01:42:43,010 --> 01:42:43,843
then we can start to see problems 
actually being solved in and delivering 

2031
01:42:47,651 --> 01:42:48,484
results.

2032
01:42:48,770 --> 01:42:51,530
Well,
what I saw from you and video is exactly

2033
01:42:51,531 --> 01:42:53,990
what I've seen from you in person.
You're very genuine person.

2034
01:42:53,991 --> 01:42:56,150
You're very intelligent and you give me 
hope.

2035
01:42:56,540 --> 01:42:57,373
You gave me hope that there are 
politicians that are legitimately in it 

2036
01:43:00,171 --> 01:43:05,171
for the right reason and that they have 
a real vision of how to fix things.

2037
01:43:05,660 --> 01:43:07,460
So thank you.
Thank you and thanks for being here.

2038
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,380
Really appreciate it.
Thanks so much.

2039
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:11,240
Tell people how to find you online.

2040
01:43:11,790 --> 01:43:14,460
I am on social media at Tulsi,
Gabard,

2041
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:15,990
instagram,
twitter,

2042
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:18,180
all of those things.
And uh,

2043
01:43:18,181 --> 01:43:21,870
you can go to my website which is vote,
[inaudible] dot com.

2044

Go their vote.
Tulsi.

2045
01:43:24,450 --> 01:43:25,590
Thank you.
Should be president.

2046
01:43:26,890 --> 01:43:27,880
Aloha.
Let's close it.

2047
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:29,093
Yeah,
there you go.
