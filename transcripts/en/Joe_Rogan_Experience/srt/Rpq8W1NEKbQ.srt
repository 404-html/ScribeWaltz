1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,670
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:01,901
you're,

3
00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:02,111
you're,

4
00:00:02,111 --> 00:00:02,361
you'll,

5
00:00:02,361 --> 00:00:03,021
you lose.

6
00:00:03,021 --> 00:00:06,110
One of the things and when you do the
math is that you'll lose your ability to

7
00:00:06,111 --> 00:00:07,880
see what's smart and what's not smart.

8
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:08,700
Like you just,

9
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,840
you lose that with every drug.

10
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:10,591
It's just not meant.

11
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:11,520
Don't blame it on meth.

12
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:12,751
Don't blame him.

13
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:13,100
I met,

14
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,933
met the list.

15
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,630
I don't think he moves it with weed.

16
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:15,931
No,

17
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:17,210
but you lose it with the heart.

18
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,181
You get deliveries.

19
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:21,750
You get your judgment is fucking foil.

20
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,950
That's what drugs do to your judgment
is fucking off and you catch yourself

21
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,430
sometimes you're like,

22
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:27,570
what the fuck did I just do?

23
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,793
Wow.

24
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,260
That's real scary part
about sometimes you're like,

25
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:32,000
what the fuck did I just,

26
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,720
and that's what a lot of
people are looking for,

27
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:33,991
Ryan.

28
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:36,780
A lot of people are looking
for this fucking big burst of,

29
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,680
of escape.

30
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,161
You know,

31
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:40,830
they're looking for something that just
blows the mat or whatever the fuck their

32
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:43,680
life is because they're
looking to just escape.

33
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,090
They don't like life.

34
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,781
They don't like it.

35
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:46,321
They want you to die.

36
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:46,581
Man.

37
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:48,600
I want to get hot and they
want to get high to escape,

38
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,800
escape reality.

39
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,540
You know man,

40
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,430
we get your back hurts,

41
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:53,841
your back hurts,

42
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:54,591
you hurt your back.

43
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:55,580
It fucking hurts bro.

44
00:00:55,581 --> 00:00:56,414
You gotta go to a doctor.

45
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,580
You know the idea.

46
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,120
I did have a butterfly sweep.

47
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:01,380
I left my thumb up on the
fucking guy landed on my head.

48
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,710
How Chihuahua my son hurt and swell up.

49
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,940
I think when I needed the drugs he
was one of my whole body was in pain.

50
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,550
And it's not pain that you feel.

51
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,990
It's just as pain and its

52
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,470
well it's also you did it for so long
when your body became accustomed to using

53
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:16,030
it beginnings.

54
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,741
But in the beginning,

55
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:18,450
why is the main reason we get down?

56
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,560
Why is the main reason that guy like
you and lose you have pain in your life

57
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,100
growing up?

58
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:23,933
We all do.

59
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,400
What made you different than not doing it?

60
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,990
You know when you uh,

61
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,970
when you first get involved in that,

62
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,530
your body hurts man.

63
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,470
I kinda,

64
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:32,670
you know,

65
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,670
when I was 17 I go home at the end
of the night when I was in school,

66
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:40,710
I had to go to school at seven
30 not going high school.

67
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:44,040
Junior had to go to school and I would
come home and sit in the corner in the

68
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:44,510
dark wood.

69
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,970
Hey iPhones on with an
eight track black sabbath.

70
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,260
And I just do coke till
three in the morning.

71
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,200
He is Christ.

72
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,960
No drinking,

73
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,793
just to cope.

74
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,330
What possesses you
would do that Joe Rogan.

75
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,830
I don't know.

76
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,101
What's it,

77
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:56,910
cause that was a junkie.

78
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,121
No,

79
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:57,930
I was,

80
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:58,530
you know what?

81
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,790
I was in so much pain,

82
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,070
but pain covers this huge
thing when you're doing drugs.

83
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,870
Pain could be a,

84
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,090
you know,

85
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,880
fucking confusion.

86
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,730
Pain shows up as confusion.

87
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:15,600
Confusion shows up.

88
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:16,950
His pain is what I'm saying to you.

89
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,580
Confused.

90
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,830
So I was 16 it could be emotional pain.

91
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,621
It could be a launch,

92
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:21,690
doesn't have to be physical.

93
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:23,250
Whole body's in pain and you're doing it.

94
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:23,500
You know,

95
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,410
I talked to the head that I
talked to the kid I kidnapped,

96
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,251
you know,

97
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:27,420
I call him a lot now.

98
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:27,930
Well,

99
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:28,471
I'm guilty.

100
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:31,680
I'm really fucking guilty of that because
I saw something when I kidnapped them

101
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:33,420
that it's not Joe Diaz.

102
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,530
I saw him suffering.

103
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,910
I saw him at one moment on the floor
handcuffed and I would never want that to

104
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:39,181
me.

105
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:39,721
You know what I'm saying?

106
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:43,290
Like I always dreaded that happens to
a friend of mine for what I did and I

107
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:43,950
always felt bad.

108
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,910
I had him call on the podcast and I
apologize to him and I always call him up

109
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,070
and I called him the other day and
we were talking and they told me,

110
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:50,551
you know,

111
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:51,420
every time I talked to him,

112
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,710
he tells me more about his life,

113
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:53,430
Bro.

114
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,290
You know what happens
since I kidnapped him,

115
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,150
I bumped into him in [inaudible] 94.

116
00:02:57,151 --> 00:02:58,440
I kidnapped them and 87,

117
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,970
I bumped into him in [inaudible]
94 and I bought coke from him.

118
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,100
He was all fucked up.

119
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:03,601
It's at,

120
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:04,040
uh,

121
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,640
at um,

122
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,160
pro street down in boulder.

123
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,540
And then he never remembered.

124
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,530
I think he blacked out.

125
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:09,790
That's how bad a shape he was in.

126
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,350
I asked him the last,

127
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,251
not this time though,

128
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:13,270
at the time before I asked him,

129
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:14,800
do you remember me buying blow from you?

130
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:15,420
He goes,

131
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,270
I remember seeing it.

132
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:18,840
I remember hating you
the next day and leave.

133
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,520
I didn't knock you the fuck out
because I caught him off guard.

134
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:23,950
He was at a bar all fucked up on
like you guys saw me some blogs,

135
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:24,970
like I look goes here.

136
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,390
The guy who kidnapped me,

137
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,150
the guy who kidnap me,

138
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,410
but I called them license blow after.

139
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,100
After you kidnapped him in before
you apologize for kidnapping,

140
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,820
she was later.

141
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,653
Yeah,

142
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,570
I saw him at a a bomb pro street.

143
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,211
Did you even say,

144
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:38,180
I'm sorry I kidnapped you.

145
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,023
Not that night.

146
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,180
I just gave him a hug and asked him if
he knew where I get some blow his shit

147
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,930
not that night gave me a hug and
I always go on the bottom of one.

148
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:47,681
I apologize.

149
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:51,250
That felt really bad and I talked to
him and Danny and he started telling me

150
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:52,290
he's 50 he was,

151
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,163
it was mother.

152
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,460
He had a heart attack.

153
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:55,871
You know,

154
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:58,660
I could tell when I talked to him on
his pictures on Facebook that he had a

155
00:03:58,661 --> 00:03:59,494
stroke,

156
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,640
you know,

157
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,780
that was off from the blow bro.

158
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,090
Sometimes when he calls me
and I can tell he's drinking,

159
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,253
you know,

160
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,210
and sometimes I feel real guilty.

161
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,081
Did I do this?

162
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:08,740
But then,

163
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,011
you know,

164
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:09,641
I'm the type of guy,

165
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:10,510
I don't play that shit.

166
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:10,990
You know,

167
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,070
I don't play that shit at all.

168
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,640
He was fucked up when
I get in that though,

169
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,230
a couple of weeks before,

170
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:18,130
you know how we got hot,

171
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:21,880
this whole thing started was because
he got a Dui fucked up some cars,

172
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,670
went to bold the hospital
on North Hospital,

173
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,553
older general.

174
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,710
And while he was in there,

175
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:26,951
you know,

176
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:27,760
boulder,

177
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,331
he was hurt.

178
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:30,190
They left them in a room by
himself when he stole a ball,

179
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,660
liquid cocaines and jumped out the window.

180
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,011
Okay.

181
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:35,200
And they caught him and I laid
on the other side of the boat.

182
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,760
When you steal a bottle of liquor,

183
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:38,640
cocaine from the hospital
you already got proud of.

184
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,161
I'm like,

185
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:40,460
God kidnapping him,

186
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:40,721
you know?

187
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:41,890
And we laugh and we giggle.

188
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:42,850
Me Kidnapping Him.

189
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,170
It makes me feel blank.

190
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:45,370
Maybe I contribute to that,

191
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:45,900
but I didn't.

192
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,680
He had his own doom.

193
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:48,880
Why didn't I get fucked up?

194
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:49,570
You know?

195
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:49,781
I mean,

196
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:51,220
I got fucked up and in different ways,

197
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:55,060
I paid in different ways because the
guilt in me doing that to a man fucking

198
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,894
destroyed me.

199
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:56,770
You know?

200
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,760
I like to fuck around.

201
00:04:57,761 --> 00:04:57,941
You know?

202
00:04:57,941 --> 00:05:00,220
I could do something bad
if somebody harms me.

203
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,630
But even with Jujitsu,

204
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:03,880
I just can't put my
forum in somebody's face.

205
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:04,150
Man.

206
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,710
I hate when I have to lay on somebody.

207
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,880
Like I'll check on him and go,

208
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,511
you okay bro.

209
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:08,550
You know I love you right now.

210
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:09,701
Let me know.

211
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:10,534
I know.

212
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:11,801
He know.

213
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:12,251
It's funny.

214
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:13,480
So for me,

215
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:14,380
seeing him in that corner,

216
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,360
I always had that guilt
that I tied him up.
