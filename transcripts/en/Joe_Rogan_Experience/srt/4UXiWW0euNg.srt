1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,690
The powerful Dom Arrera is here.

2
00:00:05,691 --> 00:00:06,524
Ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,010
I am typing that shit as I talk to you.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,320
That's why I seem like I'm slow.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,820
But I wrote,

6
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:14,181
damn,

7
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,660
I rera see that.

8
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,880
Damn I that I very character.

9
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,620
Why did he get off at the soda?

10
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,750
Like I told him pill.

11
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,280
John,

12
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,000
my rarer is uh,

13
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,710
one of my favorite human
beings on the planet,

14
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,060
but he also drives a car
from many decades ago.

15
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,640
Has No,

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,480
it is an antique.

17
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:37,070
Now I'll tell you what,

18
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:37,910
that car,

19
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,920
would it be worth a lot of money to like
a young upcoming comic if they found

20
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:44,100
out they could get ahold of Don.

21
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:45,350
My rare is Lexis.

22
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:45,721
Well,

23
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:46,470
you know it was,

24
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,070
I called it the share cause I was on
tour with Sherra and I got all this extra

25
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:51,090
cash and it's summer.

26
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,800
So I go in and buy a car.

27
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:53,720
I said a guy,

28
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,420
I'll give you 40,

29
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,260
$40,000.

30
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,441
He goes,

31
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:56,051
I can't do that.

32
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:56,341
And I said,

33
00:00:56,341 --> 00:00:57,060
all right,

34
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,331
it goes,

35
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:57,571
wait,

36
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:57,991
come back.

37
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:58,710
I said,

38
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,700
that's what I'm going to give you.

39
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,230
I can just got a brand new Honda.

40
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:02,190
I don't need Alexis.

41
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:03,510
I just want one cause it's cool.

42
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,540
Then went let me talk to my friends and
he comes back because you know I like

43
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:06,661
you.

44
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:07,494
I'd go,

45
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,311
we just met me.

46
00:01:09,311 --> 00:01:10,144
That's amazing.

47
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,420
I wonder are what quick
wonderful relationship.

48
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:14,254
This is.

49
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,301
Then I got the car.

50
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:16,150
I paid cash.

51
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:16,871
Yeah,

52
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:17,381
that's a,

53
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:19,180
that's a war horse of a fucking car,

54
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,150
but Don Maria has no goddamn
navigation system in that thing,

55
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,350
but it looks beautiful.

56
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,760
I listened to the ground like it's
like an Indian scout dumped them.

57
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,470
I'm feeling the wheels beneath my feet.

58
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,191
All radio.

59
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:31,750
That's an evil work and fix it.

60
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,390
I had my radio break once and it fucking,

61
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:36,250
I thought up more shit that day.

62
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:39,700
Then and then any other day I like I
should break my radio all the time.

63
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,350
The biggest drag or that car
is it only has a tape deck.

64
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,040
Oh no it does.

65
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,190
It's really hard to get tapes.

66
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,960
I went into a place and they have no

67
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,930
tapes left.

68
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,030
That is Goddamn hilarious.

69
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:53,930
You have a tape deck,

70
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,300
but all these other cars I've got it.

71
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,050
I've got a brand new Cadillac
for leasing and all that.

72
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,360
Something went wrong with him.

73
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:00,691
This one,

74
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:01,530
nothing stops it.

75
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:01,711
Well,

76
00:02:01,711 --> 00:02:03,810
you know those Lexus's
or fucking bulletproof.

77
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,000
You want us as bulletproof time?

78
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:05,834
I remember.

79
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,680
Oh and and it get yourself
some bulletproof coffee.

80
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,540
Mix it up with fresh butter that comes
from grass fed cows and the only way to

81
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:16,680
go on some MCT oil.

82
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,390
Could you repeat that
because I didn't get that.

83
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:18,660
This

84
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,340
is a complicated advertisement.

85
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,160
Okay.

86
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,940
onnit.com o n n I t would you need to do
is get some shroom tech sport and your

87
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:28,650
lifetime Herrera said what?

88
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,880
Shroom tech support.

89
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,320
Oh yeah.

90
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,153
Shouldn't text book.

91
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,020
I just read out.

92
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,370
You need to get some,

93
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:36,660
I'll give you some alpha Bray too.

94
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,310
I actually have a gift pack for you Jamie.

95
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:41,760
This is own little boxes in
their little gold on it boxes.

96
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,380
I have getting gifts for everybody that
magic podcasts now we give them an honor

97
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,300
gift pack and in the honor gift pack
that has all sorts of groupie shit

98
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,340
including Buffalo Jerky made
with real cranberry hungry.

99
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:57,600
No,

100
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:57,900
no,

101
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,170
no,

102
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:58,381
no.

103
00:02:58,381 --> 00:02:59,214
Hepped up on.

104
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,290
None of these things will get you higher,

105
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,191
but a,

106
00:03:02,191 --> 00:03:04,260
the Alpha brain will definitely,

107
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,491
hopefully,

108
00:03:05,491 --> 00:03:06,300
if it works for you,

109
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,070
it works for almost everybody.

110
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,840
But I believe people,

111
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:11,220
when they say it has no effect on him.

112
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,480
I absolutely believe them.

113
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:14,340
I don't know how you're
fucking dumb marks.

114
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,320
I don't even understand how mind works.

115
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,960
But I do know that
every single ingredient,

116
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:21,330
if you go to onnit.com
there's a whole page.

117
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,610
It's a based on the science behind all
of these supplements and all of it has

118
00:03:27,871 --> 00:03:32,280
been shown to increase memory
or a aid and test scores.

119
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:32,760
It's,

120
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,450
they're all just essentially nutrients
that help cognitive function.

121
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,390
It's a very controversial thing
and because it's controversial,

122
00:03:39,391 --> 00:03:44,391
we want to treat this thing like as
evenly and as honestly and as morally as

123
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:46,171
possible.

124
00:03:46,171 --> 00:03:47,910
It's kind of hard to do
when you run a business,

125
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:53,270
but the idea behind on it is
a real genuine and honest one.

126
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:57,420
And it's to try to sell you
the best shit possible at,

127
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,100
at a very reasonable price and make
it so that no one feels ripped off.

128
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,100
And one of the ways we do that is we have
a 90 day 100% money back guarantee on

129
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,500
the first 30 pills of
whether it's Alpha brain,

130
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:11,334
a shroom tech.

131
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,330
If you try it,

132
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,631
you,

133
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:12,960
you,

134
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,231
you know,

135
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:13,831
you use it,

136
00:04:13,831 --> 00:04:14,880
you don't feel like it was,

137
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,740
it had an effect on you
get your money back,

138
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:17,820
you're going to have
to return the product.

139
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,960
No one's trying to rip you off,

140
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,071
but we're,

141
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:25,071
what we are doing is selling you the
best shit possible that we actually use

142
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:27,120
ourselves.

143
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,040
I actually use Alpha brain,

144
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:29,941
shroom tech,

145
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:30,331
new mood.

146
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:32,130
I use these daily hemp force.

147
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:33,660
I eat that shit daily.

148
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,970
I use all this stuff
unless you use a lot of it.

149
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:36,804
Yeah,

150
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,010
it was a battle rope workout.

151
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:41,581
Anyway,

152
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:45,720
go to [inaudible] dot com using code
any Rogan and save yourself 10% off.

153
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,130
Have you been playing that fucking game?

154
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,590
We played actually play it.

155
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:50,490
I play it on the toilet.

156
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,840
I have an Ipad,

157
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,650
uh,

158
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,900
now my toilet that I used an old iPad.

159
00:04:54,901 --> 00:04:56,760
So there's an image I'd
like to get out of my head.

160
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,541
Yeah.

161
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:58,710
Well,

162
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,080
I,

163
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,680
um,

164
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,750
if you play it on the toilet,

165
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:02,520
I mean you've gotta be real
careful of those legs getting,

166
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,830
yeah.

167
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,300
I'm more concerned about the
hemorrhoid that it created.

168
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,200
That's how I got it.

169
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,980
I hemorrhoid you have hemorrhoids.

170
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,740
It comes from forcing things.

171
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:12,450
Is that what hammer was
sitting on the toilet too long?

172
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:12,511
I,

173
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:14,670
I sit on the toilet like all the time,

174
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,100
but his social life.

175
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:17,550
Huh?

176
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,480
It's comfortable.

177
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,381
It's warm.

178
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:20,214
It's comfortable.

179
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,010
Not have a lot of lettuce in his diet.

180
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:23,731
I'm sure.

181
00:05:23,731 --> 00:05:24,380
No rough.

182
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,300
She shits or a struggle so much.

183
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,290
Each one's a battle.

184
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,090
Tell me about it a lot.

185
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:30,710
I,

186
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,710
I poop all the time.

187
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,200
Do you?

188
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,510
Yeah.

189
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:32,940
This try,

190
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,250
this coffee is just like
two poops waiting to happen.

191
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,240
Well that's good.

192
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,680
The one you're not pooping,

193
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:38,491
you've got a real problem.

194
00:05:38,491 --> 00:05:38,620
Right?

195
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,140
I was watching this show
the other day and uh,

196
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,391
oh,

197
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:45,580
is Anthony Bourdain's show and
it was on a Philadelphia and uh,

198
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,241
he was,

199
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:46,391
uh,

200
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:46,691
it's,

201
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:46,990
um,

202
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:47,890
his other show,

203
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,251
you know,

204
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:49,660
he's got those two different shows.

205
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:49,920
Uh,

206
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,890
the one of them is called the
layover and it was that one and a,

207
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:55,090
one of the things in Philadelphia,

208
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:58,760
they went to this museum where they
had this guy would a gigantic colon and

209
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:01,400
sometimes it would be like
six to 10 days in between.

210
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:06,401
Shifts is getting shit for like
six days as colon was enormous.

211
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,450
It was disgusting.

212
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,350
So don't let that happen.

213
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:11,300
But they find out that
he had enormous colon.

214
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,320
Um,

215
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,861
well he was,

216
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:15,470
he was distended like as he was alive,

217
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,460
he looked disgusting.

218
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:16,790
They like,

219
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,260
it was really horrendous looking.

220
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,423
And um,

221
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,323
they uh,

222
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,550
they saved it in this museum.

223
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:26,390
It's a museum of all like
fucked up body anomalies.

224
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,930
I have a friend who used
to think it was manly,

225
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,070
not the pay and they would drink beer.

226
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:33,490
He drink like a 10 pack
of beer and hey listen,

227
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,301
this is crazy.

228
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:36,730
He got a distended bladder from it and it,

229
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,940
it has no resiliency to now
he has to use a catheter.

230
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,890
So every time it's so fucking sad.

231
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,960
Broke his bladder.

232
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,601
He didn't break it.

233
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:44,530
He distended it.

234
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:46,450
So it's so scratched out,

235
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,730
but it can't hold water again.

236
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,740
So he just has to use a call mark.

237
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,870
He imagined himself all the fucking
things that happened to us in life.

238
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,190
He did it to himself,

239
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:54,980
you know,

240
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,410
was he thought he was like Spartacus,

241
00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:56,621
you know,

242
00:06:56,621 --> 00:06:58,030
not pay it and that made them strong.

243
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,521
Wow.

244
00:06:58,521 --> 00:06:59,300
That's uh,

245
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,160
that's kind of an
interesting approach to life.

246
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,340
Just talking about backfire.

247
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,670
I think I should have beat
that has nothing to do with
don would playing blades

248
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,960
slinger while you're on the toilet.

249
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:13,220
I see that kerosene games is one of our
new sponsors and they have this new game

250
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:15,200
called blade runner or blade slinger.

251
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,520
I keep it same blade runner,

252
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,900
two combination.

253
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:18,734
It's played slinger,

254
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,603
goddammit.

255
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,540
Um,

256
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,280
it's pretty dope.

257
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,371
The,

258
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:22,820
the graphics are amazing.

259
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,730
It's that is,

260
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,520
that's the actual graphics of the game.

261
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,410
I mean it is really well done and it's
not a game that's ported over from a

262
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:31,160
computer.

263
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,850
They designed them
specifically for the IPAD,

264
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:35,960
iPhone interface,

265
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:38,930
the way it works with no buttons and
touchscreen and everything like that.

266
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,060
So everything works intuitively with that.

267
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,260
It's a fun fucking game.

268
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:42,820
And it's,

269
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,000
it's a really good deal too.

270
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:46,420
It's only 299 to 99 and,

271
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,121
and it's a,

272
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:47,391
it's,

273
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:49,790
it's fun to apply and kerosene games,

274
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,330
um,

275
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:50,721
their,

276
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:52,150
their whole gold,

277
00:07:52,151 --> 00:07:57,151
their whole mission is to make the
coolest video games available specifically

278
00:07:57,621 --> 00:07:59,150
for mobile devices.

279
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:00,200
So that's what they're working on.

280
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,370
Who does the main character looked like?

281
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,840
It looks like you Jamie.

282
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:05,723
Get at it.

283
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,300
It looks like you bitch.

284
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,233
One of the Jamie,

285
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:10,540
Jamie,

286
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,980
Jamie employee number two.

287
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,251
Oh,

288
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:12,790
okay.

289
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,390
Anyway,

290
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,160
blade slinger.

291
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,500
Um,

292
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,191
go get it on.

293
00:08:15,191 --> 00:08:15,820
Um,

294
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,601
on the IPAD.

295
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:18,520
You can get it on the iPhone and uh,

296
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,400
they're working on a version
of it for android apparently.

297
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,280
But a do not says Eta January,

298
00:08:24,281 --> 00:08:25,360
February high end,

299
00:08:25,361 --> 00:08:27,070
android devices as well.

300
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,480
Back to galaxy s three.

301
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,250
The galaxy has three from 10,

302
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,151
if you've been playing with it.

303
00:08:31,151 --> 00:08:31,391
Yeah,

304
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:31,820
I love it.

305
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,050
The,

306
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:32,860
the map,

307
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,221
I tell you,

308
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:33,460
man,

309
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:33,910
there's,

310
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,150
there's,

311
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,511
there's only,

312
00:08:34,511 --> 00:08:37,810
there's a few things that android
has going for it for sure.

313
00:08:37,811 --> 00:08:41,230
Especially the galaxy s three
and one is the Google maps.

314
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,390
Like just having Google maps back,

315
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:46,060
the original application that's
not on the iPhone anymore.

316
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,350
It's so nice.

317
00:08:47,351 --> 00:08:49,720
And on the Google or
the the galaxy s three,

318
00:08:49,721 --> 00:08:51,400
the screen's so big and you had like,

319
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,140
Oh nice maps,

320
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:54,010
big screen.

321
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,330
It's,

322
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,051
but you know,

323
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:56,980
I'm still playing with it.

324
00:08:56,981 --> 00:09:00,640
I don't know if it's just because I'm
so used to the iPhone for the last five

325
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:04,990
years using the same operating system or
if it's just like everything is set up

326
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:05,860
so nice.

327
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:06,601
It's very,

328
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:07,500
very intuitive.

329
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:12,501
On the iPhone I find like although
a android phones I really like,

330
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,050
um,

331
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,950
they can be a bit like windows or once
you know where the fuck everything is,

332
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:17,250
yeah,

333
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,083
everything's cool.

334
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,220
But before then it's like,

335
00:09:19,221 --> 00:09:19,320
yeah,

336
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,310
why is it here?

337
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,450
I would never see this
doing are the fuck is that.

338
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,580
I definitely would never go,

339
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:24,211
hey mom,

340
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:24,481
get a,

341
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,880
get an android over an iPhone.

342
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:27,770
Because it is like,

343
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:28,020
like,

344
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,201
oh,

345
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,440
you have to figure that
shit out this defrag.

346
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,680
Well you would if you wanted
her to call you and need you.

347
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:32,921
Right.

348
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:33,850
You're like real needy.

349
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,320
You would tell him to
get an android phone.

350
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,160
That's true.

351
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,660
Just so you have to give
her advice all the time.

352
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,650
Yeah.

353
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,010
Anyway,

354
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,930
my advice to you go
getting played slinger.

355
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,260
Yeah.

356
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,310
Get it for the IPAD.

357
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:42,970
Um,

358
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,511
and uh,

359
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:45,520
support this cool game company.

360
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:49,060
Kerosene games because they support
the podcast and it's only two 99.

361
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,310
My advice to you is you
don't need segways Mr. Yeah.

362
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,020
I'm a master at this shit come naturally.

363
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:56,200
They flow right.

364
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:01,250
Next week is when I am releasing
my standup special next Tuesday,

365
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,873
the 18th.

366
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,631
So,

367
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:03,841
uh,

368
00:10:03,841 --> 00:10:05,460
I finally got it all together.

369
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,020
Uh,

370
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,590
I know it took a long ass time.

371
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:09,510
It took a lot longer than I
thought it was going to take,

372
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:13,590
but thanks everybody for your patience
and even the people that asked about it.

373
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,060
No one was being douchey about it,

374
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:15,840
but it was,

375
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,290
yeah,

376
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,101
I agree.

377
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:18,810
I mean I recorded it in April.

378
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:19,644
It's finally coming out.

379
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,430
Is this the just the standup special
or is there any extra bonus feature?

380
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,050
Some other shit too,

381
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,310
but as of right now,

382
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,810
like it's just a standup special material
and a release that you did last night.

383
00:10:31,811 --> 00:10:32,644
If some of that in that.

384
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,130
No,

385
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:33,911
that's all new stuff.

386
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:35,560
I thought that was
fucking killer last night.

387
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:36,240
Yeah.

388
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,060
Oh yeah.

389
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,271
Yeah.

390
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:37,761
You've got dry.

391
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:38,594
Really new stuff.

392
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,550
You got the fucking
crime and no vagina joke.

393
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,440
That's groundbreaking.

394
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:46,690
Well,

395
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,291
thanks man.

396
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,920
Last night was fun as Fuck Don.

397
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:49,511
My rare is here.

398
00:10:49,511 --> 00:10:50,350
Ladies and gentlemen,

399
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,270
this is the end of the commercials.

400
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,550
Use the code a Brogan
and go fuck yourself,

401
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,271
Tom.

402
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:56,500
I rera is here.

403
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,260
God dammit set up a bit old school.

404
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,340
I can't believe I found the place.

405
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,230
One of the greats,

406
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:02,064
God dammit,

407
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,140
the Joe Rogan experience.

408
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,990
Try by day Joe Rogan podcast all day.

409
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,410
If a one hour into the podcast,

410
00:11:14,411 --> 00:11:18,070
Brian becomes a bundle of energy
and super duper talkative.

411
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,870
It may or may not be because he got
ahold of some provigil provigil.

412
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,730
Provigil may or may not be.

413
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,940
What's that?

414
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,070
Some stuff that keeps you awake?

415
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,520
I was told to tell me that

416
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,240
the way he looked at me like,

417
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:31,960
oh boy,

418
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,471
I don't need that.

419
00:11:32,471 --> 00:11:34,160
Like that's one of the worst
things you could ever do to me,

420
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:34,520
Jo.

421
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,300
Yeah,

422
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,620
that's the thing about Comedians,

423
00:11:36,621 --> 00:11:36,801
man.

424
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:38,420
We'd love to get us sleep on.

425
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:38,780
Well,

426
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,130
I mean speed would kill me.

427
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,730
Yeah.

428
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:41,750
I like down.

429
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:43,280
So I like tranquilizers.

430
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,350
If I was going to do any drug,

431
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,363
I would do heroin.

432
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:47,540
But what,

433
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,171
from what they say,

434
00:11:48,171 --> 00:11:51,650
it feels like Robert Schimmel told me
he accidentally took Adderall once.

435
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,611
He,

436
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:53,220
uh,

437
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,360
I guess it was someone he thought it was
one of his pills after he had his heart

438
00:11:57,361 --> 00:11:57,980
condition.

439
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,700
He had cancer and cancer,

440
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,680
cancer and he had a
heart condition as well.

441
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:01,861
Right.

442
00:12:01,861 --> 00:12:02,970
It was having a hard problems,

443
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:03,610
you know,

444
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,070
um,

445
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,010
whatever he was on,

446
00:12:05,011 --> 00:12:06,060
whatever medication he is on,

447
00:12:06,061 --> 00:12:10,140
he accidentally take someone else's
Adderall while he was worried.

448
00:12:10,141 --> 00:12:11,100
But his doctor said he would help,

449
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,940
would be okay.

450
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,091
You know,

451
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:12,650
like you said,

452
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,360
you like what is the,

453
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,700
what's the pill that you took?

454
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:15,534
How many milligrams?

455
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:16,561
You're going to be fine.

456
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:17,700
It's just going to take a while.

457
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,700
Just go get them.

458
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,440
He's done.

459
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,060
So he let run it around his house.

460
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:21,811
He's be organized.

461
00:12:21,811 --> 00:12:22,644
His office,

462
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,890
he said he organized all of his notes
and put them in alphabetical order,

463
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,680
like doing shit that he
would never do without it.

464
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,910
It makes you think like,

465
00:12:29,911 --> 00:12:30,181
man,

466
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:30,631
if you could,

467
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:30,841
uh,

468
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:32,610
if you could manage that correctly,

469
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,360
if you were a confident that you
could manage that Adderall stuff,

470
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,340
it seems like you get a
lot of shit done on that.

471
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,320
It coffee gets me high.

472
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:40,951
Oh,

473
00:12:40,951 --> 00:12:41,820
it definitely does.

474
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:42,901
Yeah.

475
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:43,691
I mean that's what it looks.

476
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:44,850
Especially Starbucks.

477
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,061
I mean,

478
00:12:45,061 --> 00:12:47,010
that's why this stuff is a everywhere.

479
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,420
Everybody's addicted to this stuff.

480
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,570
That was that last night I had two
drinks and I couldn't interview you.

481
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,130
You get an Mba.

482
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:53,820
We were fun.

483
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,370
It was fun.

484
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:54,781
It's fun.

485
00:12:54,781 --> 00:12:55,140
But I was,

486
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,921
I had to think,

487
00:12:55,921 --> 00:12:56,101
you know,

488
00:12:56,101 --> 00:12:56,611
usually,

489
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:58,440
I mean with you it's like just flows.

490
00:12:58,441 --> 00:13:01,140
But I'm telling you the two
drinks affecting me ever since.

491
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:02,520
I said I stopped drinking.

492
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,540
I started,

493
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:03,990
I said,

494
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,130
I thought you stopped drinking.

495
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:05,670
I did.

496
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,590
I Sat,

497
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,111
but I do.

498
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:09,840
I stopped drinking and then I have a
couple drinks every night almost to

499
00:13:09,841 --> 00:13:12,610
celebrate my sobriety and that's,

500
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,873
that's what happens.

501
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,040
I get higher because
I don't drink as much.

502
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,550
And I had those two Irish coffees.

503
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:18,930
I was,

504
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:19,763
I was fucking,

505
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,220
how many days a week are you
back to drinking a seven?

506
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:26,683
I actually didn't,

507
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,890
I didn't drink on Monday.

508
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,060
And I told my God,

509
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,170
my God daughter who lives with me,

510
00:13:31,171 --> 00:13:32,190
I go in,

511
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:33,120
I quit drinking again.

512
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,021
She said,

513
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:34,710
uh,

514
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,910
it's only Tuesday.

515
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,080
You drink Sunday.

516
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:37,471
I was like,

517
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:38,610
I'm over the whole day.

518
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:39,790
So yeah,

519
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,680
that's a tough one.

520
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,211
Yeah.

521
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:42,630
He only stopped drinking on hangovers.

522
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:42,850
You,

523
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,880
you did really well

524
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,760
for several months.

525
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:46,600
Three months.

526
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,440
And then what happened?

527
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:48,720
I Dunno,

528
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,020
it just checking those keys.

529
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:50,320
Dumb.

530
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,890
Sorry,

531
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,000
those keys are on that table.

532
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,421
I'm,

533
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:53,254
no one will forget.

534
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,240
You just missed it.

535
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,930
I missed it.

536
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:55,621
I missed the fun.

537
00:13:55,621 --> 00:13:55,891
And you know,

538
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:58,080
one of the girls that left
factory friend of mine,

539
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,001
she said to me,

540
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:01,530
she called me like basically a pussy,

541
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,300
right?

542
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,160
Right on my Juliet.

543
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:03,871
And she says,

544
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:05,270
uh Oh,

545
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,240
what are you?

546
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,490
Are you going to have a
couple drinks with me tonight?

547
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:10,660
Are you going to show me a
chip for how long gets bitch?

548
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,610
You quit drinking.

549
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,360
You know what I mean?

550
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,770
Like what a friend,

551
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,220
another friend I played ping pong
with and he goes and he'll go,

552
00:14:20,221 --> 00:14:21,630
he'll put a Martini and then my nose.

553
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,590
Doesn't that look good?

554
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,710
Like I have just the opposite
of supportive friends.

555
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,610
I have Fred to try and get me to drink.

556
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,560
It's like a reverse intervention.

557
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,610
Why do they do that?

558
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,151
I don't know.

559
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:31,020
Just for fun.

560
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,300
I mean if it didn't bloat me.

561
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,190
And do you get hangovers?

562
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,120
Oh yeah.

563
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,810
Yeah.

564
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,320
Okay.

565
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,680
And last all day now for me and
he started like the whole day,

566
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:43,080
like I'll have a hangover at
like 10 o'clock at night and go,

567
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:43,351
all right,

568
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:43,801
I guess I'm ready.

569
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:44,630
Drinks just to get rid of

570
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:44,881
you.

571
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:47,420
Gotta you gotta really over hydrate.

572
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,200
That's the key.

573
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
When you kicked it on,

574
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:49,910
water's good.

575
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,743
It's very good for that.

576
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,120
When,

577
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,450
when you,

578
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,520
when you feel that headache,

579
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,120
that's,

580
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,710
that's mostly dehydration.

581
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,720
I don't get a headache.

582
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,830
I get nervous.

583
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:57,961
You get nervous,

584
00:14:57,961 --> 00:14:58,721
like anxiety,

585
00:14:58,721 --> 00:14:59,800
heart palpitations.

586
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,340
No,

587
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,173
just like,

588
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,980
I don't know.

589
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,060
Well you realize you're
killing your body slower.

590
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:04,450
Yeah.

591
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:04,650
You know,

592
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,441
that's the feeling.

593
00:15:05,441 --> 00:15:07,600
Like you realize your impending doom.

594
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,381
That's a danger.

595
00:15:08,381 --> 00:15:09,191
Be a comedian too.

596
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:12,820
Cause you can fucking live the life
of a degenerate and then be fine by 10

597
00:15:12,821 --> 00:15:13,654
o'clock at night.

598
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,090
And let's be honest about,

599
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,361
I mean,

600
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:17,194
how much,

601
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,170
how much sobriety is required in our jobs.

602
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:20,790
You know,

603
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:20,950
I,

604
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:21,551
you can go on,

605
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:23,560
have fucked up and have a great set.

606
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,620
I can go on drunk and not even
remember to set and just go on wrote.

607
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,501
I mean,

608
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:30,370
I hate to do that,

609
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,001
but if I have,

610
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:34,850
I've done so much
standup that I could get.

611
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:35,600
I literally,

612
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,190
I don't even really from a Hammock,

613
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,170
I never,

614
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:39,650
um,

615
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,400
I remember watching
people when I was younger,

616
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,760
phone it in and we've all seen guys
phone it in where they're not really

617
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:49,890
engaging in what they're saying
and not really thinking about it.

618
00:15:49,891 --> 00:15:50,930
And I don't like to do that.

619
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:51,800
It's weird.

620
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,910
It's weird when you see it,

621
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,300
you know,

622
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,350
it's weird when you see it.

623
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,180
And it's weird when it happens to you too,

624
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,240
and maybe sometimes it doesn't
always happen to you on PR,

625
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,530
like especially starting out
and developing like along
the way you kind of like

626
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,730
realize like,

627
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:06,050
well that's set went great.

628
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:07,100
What did I do different?

629
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:08,420
And this set didn't go as good.

630
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:09,350
What did I do wrong?

631
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,160
But I remember Rah Ray
Romano got offset it.

632
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:12,490
Uh,

633
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:12,690
we,

634
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,540
I worked with him at Jimmy's comedy alley.

635
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,760
[inaudible] said,

636
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,480
I love that place.

637
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:16,730
Yeah.

638
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,100
I middled for Ray Romano back in the day.

639
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,073
It was awesome.

640
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,470
He was a great guy too.

641
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:22,191
What does a great guy,

642
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:23,480
he's such a sweetheart.

643
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,250
He hates to follow anybody's drunk,

644
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,810
but he was great about it though.

645
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:27,980
He was so funny,

646
00:16:27,981 --> 00:16:28,281
man.

647
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:29,820
He was so goddamn good.

648
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:30,291
But anyway,

649
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,130
he got off stage.

650
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:31,431
I mean,

651
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:33,860
he just crushed for 45 minutes.

652
00:16:33,861 --> 00:16:35,330
I absolutely destroyed.

653
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,080
And then he got off to a job wound that
was about the most autopilot I've ever

654
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:39,470
been.

655
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,570
Really just walked right through that one.

656
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,700
It's like he just,

657
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,241
he goes,

658
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:46,310
I totally found it in and
they fucking bought it.

659
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:46,731
Hook,

660
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:47,564
line and sinker.

661
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,500
It was hilarious.

662
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,590
Benefit with him for Peter Boyles,

663
00:16:50,591 --> 00:16:51,130
uh,

664
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:51,401
you know,

665
00:16:51,401 --> 00:16:53,170
his wife started a cancer fund,

666
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:54,004
the research thing,

667
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,851
and Ray,

668
00:16:54,851 --> 00:16:55,684
uh,

669
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,021
you know,

670
00:16:56,021 --> 00:16:56,651
it comes up to me.

671
00:16:56,651 --> 00:16:57,131
It's so funny.

672
00:16:57,131 --> 00:16:57,641
Our lives,

673
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,474
he goes,

674
00:16:58,930 --> 00:16:59,810
can I ask you a question?

675
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,760
May sound a little awkward.

676
00:17:00,761 --> 00:17:00,971
I go,

677
00:17:00,971 --> 00:17:01,151
why?

678
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:01,451
He goes,

679
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:02,980
did you talk about your balls at all?

680
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:03,651
Like,

681
00:17:03,651 --> 00:17:04,660
I want to know why it goes,

682
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:04,811
Oh,

683
00:17:04,811 --> 00:17:06,090
I've got a ball bit I wanted to do,

684
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,260
but I don't want to talk
about balls again if you did.

685
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,730
Thanks for checking in with me.

686
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:09,981
Right.

687
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:10,814
I appreciate it.

688
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:13,311
Yeah.

689
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:13,641
God,

690
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:15,140
did you ever have that with guys?

691
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:15,591
Like they say,

692
00:17:15,591 --> 00:17:15,801
oh,

693
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:16,161
sorry,

694
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,030
I didn't know that you talked to

695
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,470
that and you know,

696
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,101
yeah,

697
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:19,934
of course.

698
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,870
I don't give a fuck.

699
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,651
Do you give a fuck?

700
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:22,310
I didn't like,

701
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:22,611
no,

702
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:24,230
I don't care if I tell you what I took.

703
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:29,320
I did a bit that Johnny Sanchez did
and I knew that I had to have heard it

704
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,960
subconsciously because I swear
to God and Johnny knows me.

705
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,160
He knows I wouldn't take it,

706
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:39,161
but it was too specific was about
Mesopotamia and Persia and Babylonia.

707
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,100
Like it had too many rings
to it that I thought John,

708
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:43,701
he goes,

709
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:43,881
no,

710
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:44,211
do it.

711
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:44,510
Like go,

712
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,410
I'm not going to do it.

713
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,090
Cause I know I had to like I could've
been sitting upstairs the laugh factory,

714
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,400
not even paying attention.

715
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,230
Heard it in my mind.

716
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:52,891
You know what I mean?

717
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:55,590
That's the dangerous somebody didn't
cause sometimes it's not malicious.

718
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,600
Sometimes it's that weird thing where
you're working with a guy and they have a

719
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:03,530
bit that's on the same
subject as your bed,

720
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,140
but it's a different bit like all the
sudden your friend has a time machine bit

721
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,160
but old out of nowhere.

722
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:08,381
Yeah,

723
00:18:08,381 --> 00:18:08,670
yeah,

724
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:08,941
yeah.

725
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:09,271
You're like,

726
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:09,781
okay,

727
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:10,141
yeah.

728
00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:11,220
Well that's not my bed.

729
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:11,641
Yeah.

730
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:12,360
Yours is a def.

731
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,260
Definitely a different bit,

732
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:16,190
but you're going to do a time machine
bit right before I do a time machine bit

733
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,710
that's,

734
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,071
yeah,

735
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:19,560
I've seen that on the road where
you have the Middle Act to do,

736
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,640
I'm going to lack the next night.

737
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,620
All of a sudden has same subject matter.

738
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,000
He wrote anything on your material,

739
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:25,960
uh,

740
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,601
guys who,

741
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:26,800
uh,

742
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,500
open for you when they're doing that shit.

743
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,790
It's so gross,

744
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,840
so transparent,

745
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:31,830
you know,

746
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,330
and I hate to tell people what to do,

747
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:33,700
you know,

748
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,770
before the subject matter.

749
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,570
I feel like so,

750
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,270
but you can't,

751
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:36,860
you cannot,

752
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,660
it's just to you,

753
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,131
you know,

754
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:40,710
when someone's got
actual bits and you know,

755
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:43,590
when someone is just trying to step
on a step on the subject matter,

756
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:46,290
it's a weird thing that people do when
they get competitive with the other acts

757
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,124
that they're working with.

758
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,140
And it just ruins the whole vibe.

759
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,960
Like if you go on the road with people
and everybody's having a good time and

760
00:18:51,961 --> 00:18:53,430
everybody wants everybody else to do well,

761
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,930
that's like a great feeling when you're
working with a guy and he wants you to

762
00:18:57,931 --> 00:18:58,321
eat it.

763
00:18:58,321 --> 00:19:00,150
And so he's trying to like bury you.

764
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,830
He's trying to do shit to burry you.

765
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,060
That's a weird feeling.

766
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,370
Even imagine that way.

767
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,710
I won't guy that did that to me.

768
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:08,544
Yeah.

769
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,780
And a New Jersey and he just kept
trying to fuck me and I could tell,

770
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:13,710
you know what I mean?

771
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,070
It's just,

772
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,191
yeah,

773
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:15,360
that's the area for it.

774
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,841
I had,

775
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:16,680
mine was in Philly,

776
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:18,300
my worst case examples in Philly.

777
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,840
I had this whole bit about Madonna and
this dude did the bit in front of me and

778
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:26,070
use Janet Jackson.

779
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,820
Oh,

780
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,650
like did the exact same bit.

781
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,690
I mean it was the same number.

782
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,090
You called her a whore in it.

783
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:33,690
No,

784
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,070
a tall,

785
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,040
beautiful human being.

786
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,230
Oh,

787
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:35,581
okay.

788
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:36,630
We're called the wrong bit.

789
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:37,290
No,

790
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:37,591
it was,

791
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:38,160
uh,

792
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,380
it was just about watching the videos.

793
00:19:40,381 --> 00:19:41,250
A stupid joke.

794
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,020
I don't even remember
the exact wording of it.

795
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:47,190
And watching a video on Madonna video
while my girlfriend was in the room and

796
00:19:47,191 --> 00:19:48,770
having to feel dumb questions.

797
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,000
Like if you had to choose our enemy,

798
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:51,660
I'm like,

799
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,140
Jack,

800
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,190
I want you to be honest.

801
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,361
And they choke.

802
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:59,160
It's like I would fuck her in front
of you over your mother's house on the

803
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:01,620
kitchen table with her
ass and your corn flakes.

804
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,300
So it was a stupid joke,

805
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,080
but this dude had the exact same
joke the next day with Janet Jackson.

806
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:08,371
I'm like,

807
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:09,360
well that's crazy.

808
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,860
Like you just stole that joke.

809
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:11,461
And it was,

810
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,140
I didn't know,

811
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,601
you know,

812
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:13,291
back in the day,

813
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,740
I didn't really know exactly how it,

814
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,840
how you dealt with that.

815
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,730
I had enough material
that it didn't matter.

816
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:18,570
I didn't have to do it.

817
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:20,250
It was like already phasing that bit out.

818
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,390
But I thought it was crazy.

819
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,730
This guy had like two or three bits.

820
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:26,880
All of the sudden they were on the
same subjects and one of them was like

821
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:30,480
basically the same exact
joke and just reworded it.

822
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,360
Did you ever throw something away and
somebody picks it up and runs with it?

823
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,830
I had like a thing where I was talking
about I'm not a racist unless I'm in

824
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:38,664
traffic,

825
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,900
then I become a racist,

826
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:40,150
you know,

827
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,820
it's gotta be a fucking
Chink in front of me.

828
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,820
I know it's gotta be a chink broad.

829
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:45,660
Right.

830
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,493
And I drive with,

831
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,900
see it is,

832
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,813
it's like,

833
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,110
why would you ever throw that away?

834
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:51,611
Well,

835
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:51,711
I,

836
00:20:51,711 --> 00:20:51,920
Gee,

837
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,670
I don't know.

838
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,503
But anyway,

839
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,000
there's an act at the,

840
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,560
at the,

841
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:55,850
uh,

842
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,601
plant factor now.

843
00:20:56,601 --> 00:21:00,780
His whole first five minutes is
about that in a racist and traffic.

844
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,150
So,

845
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:01,481
wow.

846
00:21:01,481 --> 00:21:02,800
And he heard you talk about this.

847
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:03,843
He had to hear it.

848
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,300
That's,

849
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,390
that's really pathetic.

850
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,180
Pathetically like motivated.

851
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:08,230
I've seen guys do that.

852
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:11,950
I've seen guys take a bit that someone
else said in a conversation and all of a

853
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:12,784
sudden they,

854
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,180
well,

855
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,800
what they don't understand
is that a lot of times,

856
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:16,450
like when you say
something in conversation,

857
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:19,140
you might have already
said it on stage or you,

858
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:19,361
you know,

859
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,550
if you have like a point
of view on something,

860
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:24,160
it might be something you've already
been working on for a long time.

861
00:21:24,161 --> 00:21:26,770
And if you lay out the
premise like that to a guy,

862
00:21:26,771 --> 00:21:27,640
like that's,

863
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,890
it's just as bad as stealing material.

864
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,400
Right?

865
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,090
But you know,

866
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,290
some things you can't steal.

867
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,780
Like when you were doing the
two bits about your daughter,

868
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,000
it's so vivid.

869
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,710
Like you can see that that's a,

870
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:38,911
I mean,

871
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:39,010
yeah,

872
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,431
but you know,

873
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,264
I'm not going to tell you that.

874
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,590
That's what makes it so funny,

875
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,950
but it's like perfectly executed in the
sense that you see her and you see you

876
00:21:47,831 --> 00:21:48,250
and hear you.

877
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,083
You know,

878
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,440
not,

879
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,380
not just the banana thing,

880
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:55,150
but the second thing is fucking hilarious
because it brings you in to something

881
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:55,450
that's,

882
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,080
that's what people hopefully can't
steal is your essence and your,

883
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,943
your own,

884
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,641
your own life.

885
00:22:00,641 --> 00:22:00,821
You know,

886
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:02,650
if somebody starts talking
about my cousin Johnny,

887
00:22:02,651 --> 00:22:03,640
I know they stole from me.

888
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,500
I know they can fuck
around and dance around.

889
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:05,610
Yeah.

890
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,443
Shit but,

891
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:11,530
but this is a weird thing with being
influenced by people versus stealing from

892
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:13,610
people because yeah,

893
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,500
we're all influence is like
we didn't get here on our own.

894
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,430
None of us get her on her own.

895
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,210
I think what we would,

896
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:23,040
everybody is always concerned with
though is like the honesty of where these

897
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,120
ideas are coming from.

898
00:22:24,121 --> 00:22:26,190
Like you're taking
ideas from other people.

899
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,540
The whole vibe of what you're doing is
completely different because they're like

900
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,220
the vibe of a standup comedian.

901
00:22:32,221 --> 00:22:36,270
Like what I love about say a guy like you
when you're on stage and you're killin

902
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:41,630
is I know that this is your
mind putting all this together.

903
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:47,300
I know this is like any individual's
point of view and expression and I lock

904
00:22:47,821 --> 00:22:50,460
into it and have a great
time with your thoughts.

905
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:55,610
But as soon as I think that you're
just parroting someone else's words,

906
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,230
as soon as I think that this isn't
something that you've absorbed,

907
00:22:58,231 --> 00:22:59,700
this isn't a part of you as a human,

908
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,211
this is,

909
00:23:00,211 --> 00:23:01,530
these aren't your actual thoughts.

910
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,120
These aren't your actual conclusions.

911
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,361
Right.

912
00:23:03,361 --> 00:23:05,250
This is just you saying some shit.

913
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,900
Well then you lose,

914
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,340
you lose a big chunk of
that connection then.

915
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,050
Then you,

916
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,910
then we have a bullshit relationship.

917
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,020
There's no soul to it.

918
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,340
I was watching a guy last week and he
really was stuck in the 80s and really

919
00:23:17,341 --> 00:23:17,750
stuck,

920
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,160
you know,

921
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,820
for witness without being able
to budge and he was just doing,

922
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,750
he had nothing,

923
00:23:21,751 --> 00:23:22,584
had any heart too.

924
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,150
It was just like,

925
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,680
it Kinda like Rodney did.

926
00:23:25,681 --> 00:23:28,050
It's so extreme that it was funny.

927
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,820
You knew that it was a character.

928
00:23:29,821 --> 00:23:32,460
You knew it was jokes and it was funny
because his character is so brilliant.

929
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,860
This guy was trying to
act like it was him,

930
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,390
but it was jokey jokes.

931
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,231
Do you know what I mean?

932
00:23:37,231 --> 00:23:38,580
It was bizarre and I thought,

933
00:23:38,581 --> 00:23:38,990
okay,

934
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,160
would you put that away?

935
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,700
What happened is a video of me
and I was like 20 years old.

936
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,690
This is so crazy.

937
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,440
Somebody just like,

938
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,170
I just remember

939
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,080
Dama rare from full frontal comedy.

940
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:48,460
So I'm like,

941
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,400
I wonder if I can find that
clip and I just hold it up.

942
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,900
Show on full random.

943
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,343
Aye

944
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,363
did it with dumb.

945
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,510
I've never seen this before.

946
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:57,661
Oh,

947
00:23:57,661 --> 00:23:58,141
it's terrible.

948
00:23:58,141 --> 00:24:00,630
Don't you dare still leans
forward when he screamed.

949
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,210
Flexibility.

950
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:03,840
Waste.

951
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,673
Oh Wow.

952
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:05,723
This is crazy.

953
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,370
I love it.

954
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,720
Is Do you know Joe?

955
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,421
I don't know.

956
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:09,390
It's probably terrible though.

957
00:24:09,391 --> 00:24:09,901
Whatever it is.

958
00:24:09,901 --> 00:24:11,220
And something involved with a penis.

959
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,420
Don't turn it Brian.

960
00:24:13,421 --> 00:24:14,254
Stop it.

961
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,241
Do not.

962
00:24:15,241 --> 00:24:16,600
Last thing I want to hear is my oldest

963
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,060
fuck outta here with that here a minute.

964
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,350
One minute and go to Google.

965
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,090
Go Youtube it yourself.

966
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,890
I don't listen to myself,

967
00:24:27,891 --> 00:24:28,310
man.

968
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,143
The last thing,

969
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,801
even my special,

970
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:32,780
like I didn't listen
to it until last week.

971
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,570
I would like a a day to,

972
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:35,930
uh,

973
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,330
to edit it and I watched it
for the first time that night.

974
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,813
Yeah.

975
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,230
I don't like watching myself.

976
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:42,890
I don't either.

977
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:43,400
I like,

978
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,360
I do it for the purposes
of working on material.

979
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:51,650
Like I'll listen to the recordings and
I do learn shit when I watch myself.

980
00:24:51,651 --> 00:24:52,310
Like what,

981
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,690
what I think is more effective,

982
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:56,960
like what pauses are more effective
or moves and more effective,

983
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:57,470
like,

984
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,810
and you can incorporate what you,

985
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:00,200
you figure it out from watching yourself.

986
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,370
But it's like,

987
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,540
it takes away from a lot of the
fun of the improvisation of it all.

988
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:06,374
Yeah.

989
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,970
I don't want to watch myself.

990
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,490
Do you mind if we watch?

991
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,460
No.

992
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,930
Well you might step it out for a minute.

993
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,920
I cannot wait to watch it.

994
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:16,420
I just,

995
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,520
I'd never seen that before.

996
00:25:17,521 --> 00:25:18,820
You kill up in Montreal.

997
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,390
Dom and I became friends because,

998
00:25:21,391 --> 00:25:21,660
uh,

999
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,381
we did.

1000
00:25:22,381 --> 00:25:22,770
Uh,

1001
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,603
we did,

1002
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:24,743
what was it called?

1003
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,221
What was,

1004
00:25:25,221 --> 00:25:26,640
it might've been called the danger zone.

1005
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,730
Danger zone from the danger
zone or something like that.

1006
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,610
Uh,

1007
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,640
it was in Montreal at the club Soda.

1008
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,480
Yeah.

1009
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,940
And that was the first
time I met you with it.

1010
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,191
Yeah.

1011
00:25:35,191 --> 00:25:37,680
That was my first like real TV credit,

1012
00:25:37,681 --> 00:25:38,430
I think.

1013
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,263
I think I did.

1014
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,230
He did MTV half hour comedy
hour before that and then I,

1015
00:25:43,231 --> 00:25:45,360
but I didn't really care about
that one cause I couldn't swear.

1016
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:45,961
You know,

1017
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,430
so I want to do a real one.

1018
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:52,460
That was like my first real set and
then dom and I met again an Amsterdam

1019
00:25:52,891 --> 00:25:54,450
billiards and that's when we fell in love.

1020
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,580
Yet we found out that we played pool.

1021
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,650
Dom and I played pool.

1022
00:25:58,651 --> 00:26:03,651
We were regulars at a set of
established that will remain unnamed.

1023
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,713
Look at that guy,

1024
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:09,560
young chap from 19 it's
like I got a wig on it.

1025
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:10,870
Look at the fucking moves.

1026
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:14,530
He's got stomach three
it'd be 64 inches long.

1027
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,773
I don't even remember that.

1028
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,060
Right about this guy.

1029
00:26:22,061 --> 00:26:24,220
He got hit by two trains in one day.

1030
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:27,821
Listen,

1031
00:26:27,821 --> 00:26:28,181
listen,

1032
00:26:28,181 --> 00:26:29,200
we don't have to do that to you.

1033
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,650
Isn't it weird like seeing a
recorded version of yourself?

1034
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,810
I was like 50 pounds lighter
with the big head of hair.

1035
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,920
Dom Irrera listen.

1036
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,670
Well we need to do is get
you a podcast first of all.

1037
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:44,523
I got a podcast.

1038
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,370
Yeah,

1039
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,120
been on it.

1040
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,690
I know,

1041
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,200
I know,

1042
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,501
I know,

1043
00:26:47,501 --> 00:26:48,220
I know.

1044
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:48,610
Listen,

1045
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,443
let me finish.

1046
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,950
When you have a podcast,

1047
00:26:50,951 --> 00:26:55,951
what I'm saying is we need to get you
a podcast that just deals with you not

1048
00:26:56,921 --> 00:26:57,754
drinking.

1049
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:58,391
All right,

1050
00:26:58,391 --> 00:27:01,480
I'll podcasts where you just,

1051
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,880
you get all or any,

1052
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:07,210
any like momentum you have,

1053
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:09,430
any motivation that you have to drink,

1054
00:27:09,431 --> 00:27:12,070
any like release a podcast about it.

1055
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:15,580
Release a podcast about why you want to
go have a drink or why you don't want to

1056
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:16,390
have a drink.

1057
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:20,860
And I think people would be absolutely
fascinated by the struggle of it all.

1058
00:27:20,861 --> 00:27:22,150
Cause you're very open about it.

1059
00:27:22,151 --> 00:27:23,170
You're very honest about it.

1060
00:27:23,171 --> 00:27:26,530
Every time you've come on the podcast
when you haven't drank and you were

1061
00:27:26,531 --> 00:27:29,080
telling me how great your
field and then now you're like,

1062
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:29,260
Eh,

1063
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,580
it's too fucking fun shit.

1064
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,483
I'll be your cohost.

1065
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,880
And I try not to judge told the,

1066
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:33,051
you know,

1067
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:37,580
like in a young Frankenstein when
gene wilder says no matter what,

1068
00:27:37,581 --> 00:27:39,620
I say don't do not open that door.

1069
00:27:39,621 --> 00:27:41,300
And he walks in to talk to the monster.

1070
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:41,830
Remember that?

1071
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,560
Yeah.

1072
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:42,741
Well,

1073
00:27:42,741 --> 00:27:45,350
I said to Noel last night
at the laugh factory said,

1074
00:27:45,351 --> 00:27:46,610
do not give me a drink,

1075
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,421
another drink.

1076
00:27:47,421 --> 00:27:48,710
Are there any circumstances?

1077
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,900
I come back 10 minutes later
I'll take another drink.

1078
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:51,390
He goes,

1079
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,250
I don't know what to do.

1080
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,480
You just told me that to give it to.

1081
00:27:53,481 --> 00:27:53,780
I said,

1082
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,411
forget about what?

1083
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:55,010
I said,

1084
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:55,970
don't you gotta listen to me.

1085
00:27:55,971 --> 00:27:56,804
I'm a drunk.

1086
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,481
You can't.

1087
00:27:58,481 --> 00:27:59,314
Um,

1088
00:27:59,440 --> 00:27:59,950
um,

1089
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:04,630
I mean you can't keep like seesaw on like
that and I think maybe doing a podcast

1090
00:28:04,631 --> 00:28:07,090
would be a good catharsis.

1091
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:07,451
Well,

1092
00:28:07,451 --> 00:28:12,451
a good sort of a method to try to
stay sober if you really want to.

1093
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,271
I mean,

1094
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:14,260
if you don't want to look,

1095
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:14,680
I mean,

1096
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,530
I would never try to go to Stan
hope and tell him a sober up.

1097
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:18,671
She hasn't.

1098
00:28:18,671 --> 00:28:20,110
Why can't imagine him sober?

1099
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,100
He doesn't want to do it.

1100
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,120
If he wanted any.

1101
00:28:22,121 --> 00:28:23,230
And if you wanted to do it,

1102
00:28:23,231 --> 00:28:23,770
he could do it.

1103
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:24,940
He can do it anytime he wanted to.

1104
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,330
He could.

1105
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,770
He could do it tomorrow if you want it to.

1106
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,701
He couldn't.

1107
00:28:27,701 --> 00:28:29,770
Mitch Hedberg was the one
I tried to reach out to.

1108
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:30,580
Really?

1109
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:30,850
Yeah.

1110
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:31,541
Because he,

1111
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:32,020
you know,

1112
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,771
he was killing him,

1113
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:33,604
so obviously,

1114
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,301
but I mean,

1115
00:28:34,301 --> 00:28:34,630
you know,

1116
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,910
I didn't know he was doing heroin well.

1117
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,773
I was worried.

1118
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:40,510
I think statistically
heroin safer than alcohol.

1119
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:41,350
Really?

1120
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,183
Yeah.

1121
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,451
I think,

1122
00:28:43,451 --> 00:28:44,284
um,

1123
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,700
I think alcohol is a,

1124
00:28:45,701 --> 00:28:46,900
it's a really dangerous shit.

1125
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,270
We just don't think it's
dangerous because it's everywhere.

1126
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,850
It crushes your immune system,

1127
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,730
but it also makes you feel great too.

1128
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,760
I've got a couple of whiskeys,

1129
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:55,780
senior sweet home.

1130
00:28:55,781 --> 00:28:56,880
Alabama comes on me.

1131
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,820
I think that's the secret is
going back to beer for me.

1132
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,080
I think I need to just go,

1133
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:04,530
I used to only drink beer then I just
got on this Jack Daniels kick out of

1134
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:05,490
nowhere and I'm just like,

1135
00:29:05,491 --> 00:29:06,750
why am I drinking so much jack?

1136
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:09,460
I could through almost
75% of bottled and no,

1137
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,710
I think gunfighter in the old west.

1138
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:11,920
Yeah.

1139
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,320
I drink like whiskey now.

1140
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,480
Me Too.

1141
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,313
That was that about,

1142
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,610
I like it.

1143
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:17,140
I like it.

1144
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,230
It makes me feel like I'm alive.

1145
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,030
I love that feeling down your throat.

1146
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,043
Whoa.

1147
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,561
Yeah.

1148
00:29:21,561 --> 00:29:24,890
I had a shot last weekend before
I went on stage and Seattle.

1149
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,551
I did that.

1150
00:29:25,551 --> 00:29:26,480
A parlor live,

1151
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:27,600
if you have to do that place up there,

1152
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:28,940
it's quick right club.

1153
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:29,991
They uh,

1154
00:29:29,991 --> 00:29:32,150
that area of Seattle,

1155
00:29:32,151 --> 00:29:32,631
Washington,

1156
00:29:32,631 --> 00:29:36,590
it's called Bellevue to a suburb
is fucking beautiful out there.

1157
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,560
It's so beautiful.

1158
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,211
Northwest.

1159
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:39,044
It's incredible.

1160
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,943
And it's so like,

1161
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,810
it's all like,

1162
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,900
it's very like high end
stores and Nice area.

1163
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,350
I guess that's where like
Microsoft is or something to,

1164
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:46,840
Huh?

1165
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,231
Shit.

1166
00:29:47,231 --> 00:29:48,560
Load of that paper up there.

1167
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,610
Mercer island making that big paper.

1168
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,690
What's Mercer Island?

1169
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:53,524
That's an island up there.

1170
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,510
My girlfriend from college lives.

1171
00:29:55,511 --> 00:29:55,840
Yeah.

1172
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,261
Really?

1173
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,250
She lives on an island.

1174
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,160
I still go out there
and give it one feeling.

1175
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,470
Put a theme,

1176
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,610
that graph offer for college.

1177
00:30:02,611 --> 00:30:03,440
It's still slam it to,

1178
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,690
I know she imagined.

1179
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,400
She looks much older than me now.

1180
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,593
That's,

1181
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:09,260
you know,

1182
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:09,840
it's sad.

1183
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,810
We get so program like no
matter what I look like,

1184
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,130
I,

1185
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:13,741
I still,

1186
00:30:13,741 --> 00:30:16,440
I can't get a fucking hard on
unless the chicks young and hot,

1187
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,030
I'm done.

1188
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,030
I thought,

1189
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:20,783
you know what I mean,

1190
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,953
I'm fucking done.

1191
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,640
People would call you shallow.

1192
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,900
I have to go to another country.

1193
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,703
I am shallow,

1194
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,420
shallow,

1195
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,253
like I don't care.

1196
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,120
You know,

1197
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,800
I don't care what it girls accomplished.

1198
00:30:31,801 --> 00:30:32,880
I care about her looks.

1199
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,830
I don't care what you got.

1200
00:30:34,831 --> 00:30:36,330
What a phd in philosophy.

1201
00:30:36,331 --> 00:30:37,350
Talk to me baby.

1202
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:38,430
I'm hard as a rock.

1203
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,470
You not sexually right.

1204
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,341
Not Sexually.

1205
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:41,710
I mean I,

1206
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,880
I'd be interested in the person.

1207
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:43,780
Yeah,

1208
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,680
there's that quote.

1209
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,130
Um,

1210
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,510
fuck who said that quote,

1211
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,383
goddammit.

1212
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,000
I forget who it was,

1213
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:49,751
but he said,

1214
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:50,584
um,

1215
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,470
all I need from a woman
is to be attracted to her.

1216
00:30:53,471 --> 00:30:54,510
Everything else I get from him,

1217
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:55,344
man.

1218
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,190
I think it was George Harrison.

1219
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:57,881
Really?

1220
00:30:57,881 --> 00:30:58,121
Yeah,

1221
00:30:58,121 --> 00:30:59,410
I think it was George Harrison said that.

1222
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,920
I think I've always
attributed to George Harrison,

1223
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:04,390
but it did Google and I couldn't find it,

1224
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,090
but I remember reading
it somewhere really,

1225
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,040
really a pretty positive.

1226
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,280
It's him.

1227
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,490
It's as a whole bit about it.

1228
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,780
He has a whole bit about,

1229
00:31:13,781 --> 00:31:14,230
um,

1230
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:17,770
like a that like if you really
wanted to hang out with somebody,

1231
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,311
you know,

1232
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:19,690
if he was on a deserted island,

1233
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:20,890
he would want it to be a woman.

1234
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,020
Cause cause he gets fucking
bored of talking to her.

1235
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,450
You know he's not compatible like yeah.

1236
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:30,430
If you want to be attracted to a
woman like unfortunately for the male

1237
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:34,660
reproductive system and we get our bodies
get triggered by young fertile women.

1238
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,970
It's an amazing hell interesting.

1239
00:31:36,971 --> 00:31:40,540
They'd become like a leave so
stupid and I find it riveting.

1240
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:41,701
Fuck,

1241
00:31:41,701 --> 00:31:44,050
he never said an original
thing in your life.

1242
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,960
It's just so crazy that are,

1243
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:49,610
our bodies are like programmed
to that where rationally your,

1244
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,740
your consciousness,

1245
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,660
the idea is like if we're going to evolve,

1246
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,970
your consciousness should be able to
look at that and go I have nothing in

1247
00:31:54,971 --> 00:31:56,690
common with his 23 year olds drive.

1248
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,610
What I need to be doing is dating at 50
year old woman like myself and you know,

1249
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:02,920
and go out and enjoy our
last year's together.

1250
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,870
Let's go get a beer.

1251
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,490
But you if you,

1252
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:07,090
you know,

1253
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,990
the problem is like if you were
still in the sex and he's still,

1254
00:32:10,991 --> 00:32:14,280
your body unfortunately wants that.

1255
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,390
It does shape body.

1256
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:17,380
Dick does not lie.

1257
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,373
It did.

1258
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,810
It's like you feel so shallow and heart.

1259
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,460
The I seriously am shallow.

1260
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:24,760
I mean,

1261
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,460
I pride myself on my shallow,

1262
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,140
shallow in a year or whatever it is.

1263
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,283
Michelle,

1264
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,390
this lack of depth with this,

1265
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,780
the girls that are easy on the eyes
are never easy on the heart though.

1266
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,430
Oh,

1267
00:32:38,431 --> 00:32:39,264
beautiful.

1268
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:40,883
You are

1269
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,840
good reads you the eyes.

1270
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,140
I say unto Thee Brian,

1271
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,410
year before our balls,

1272
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:53,920
the fucking lecturer frick you.

1273
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:54,771
No,

1274
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:56,720
you're fucking toilet seat.

1275
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,130
Beauty on the eyes.

1276
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,140
I love it.

1277
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,231
Okay.

1278
00:32:59,231 --> 00:33:00,590
So have you been in starting to come out?

1279
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,620
Have you been in love twice today?

1280
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,221
No.

1281
00:33:04,221 --> 00:33:06,560
I mean real love where you
live and eat and sleep.

1282
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,420
Yeah.

1283
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:07,911
I fall,

1284
00:33:07,911 --> 00:33:10,430
I fall deeper in love
really fast actually.

1285
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:11,743
So that's,

1286
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,853
yeah.

1287
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,183
You don't,

1288
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,070
no,

1289
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,680
no I don't.

1290
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,650
I mean I have been like Kinda
married four times in my life,

1291
00:33:19,651 --> 00:33:20,910
but only you get married once,

1292
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,753
but yeah,

1293
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,180
Dom's been in some situations before.

1294
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,230
He's had some struggle.

1295
00:33:25,231 --> 00:33:25,341
Well,

1296
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:25,770
the CRA,

1297
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,880
the one extra person.

1298
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:28,531
Horrible.

1299
00:33:28,531 --> 00:33:29,160
Craziest.

1300
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,210
I can't even do that.

1301
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,680
That the whole thing with the
house and all that other number.

1302
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,510
How many of them had green cards?

1303
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,350
Yeah,

1304
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:36,700
yeah.

1305
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,860
How many had green cards?

1306
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:38,180
Time?

1307
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:38,901
They were all,

1308
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:39,560
uh,

1309
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,161
citizens.

1310
00:33:40,161 --> 00:33:41,020
I was proud to say

1311
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,760
not of the United States,

1312
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:47,630
but do you feel bad for like a
chick that has to date a comedian?

1313
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,620
Like for the most part,

1314
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,160
like why would you want to
date crazy fucking comedian?

1315
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,180
Because comedians are like some of
the brightest people I've ever met.

1316
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,120
So I think that,

1317
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,070
see that's the difference.

1318
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,530
We're just going back to,

1319
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,100
they find that attractive.

1320
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,440
You can get women because they are,

1321
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,160
uh,

1322
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,450
they're just shallow in
a different way there.

1323
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:06,860
They,

1324
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,280
you know,

1325
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:07,910
they,

1326
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:10,400
they couldn't be with a
guy who just a good guy,

1327
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,420
they have to laugh,

1328
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:11,871
you know,

1329
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:12,580
especially like,

1330
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,490
like these models.

1331
00:34:13,491 --> 00:34:17,150
I remember working at the river cafe
when I was parking cars and the models,

1332
00:34:17,151 --> 00:34:19,580
nobody asks them out because
there were too fucking hot.

1333
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,360
Right.

1334
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,500
So they were alone all the time,

1335
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:22,640
you know,

1336
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,390
and like they,

1337
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:25,190
nobody was attracted to them or no,

1338
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,600
I guess people were afraid of them,

1339
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:27,440
you know,

1340
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,670
they just didn't want to get shot down.

1341
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,470
They didn't think they were.

1342
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,050
Yeah.

1343
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:32,110
Have you ever been in that
situation before where girls,

1344
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,730
you just felt like a girl was too good
for you and you couldn't even try?

1345
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:35,600
I,

1346
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,680
I'm that thick.

1347
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,400
No,

1348
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:37,821
never.

1349
00:34:37,821 --> 00:34:38,700
Even when you were in Denver,

1350
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,021
you know,

1351
00:34:39,021 --> 00:34:44,021
I tried everything and I've gotten girls
way out of my league just being funny

1352
00:34:44,871 --> 00:34:46,060
and honesty.

1353
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,310
Well,

1354
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:48,890
you've been a comedian
for so fucking long to,

1355
00:34:48,891 --> 00:34:50,500
it's like you probably
don't know her weight.

1356
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:57,250
You probably don't remember what it's
like to just be a out there in the free

1357
00:34:57,561 --> 00:34:58,190
world.

1358
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:58,670
But I was,

1359
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:03,350
I was like better looking then I was
better as I got less good looking,

1360
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:03,920
my,

1361
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,990
I got richer and more famous.

1362
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,240
Right.

1363
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,620
You know what I mean?

1364
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,120
So it kind of balanced off,

1365
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,500
you know what I'm saying?

1366
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,880
If you go to like a third world country,

1367
00:35:10,881 --> 00:35:14,630
you'll press the Fuckos Kailand I'm big,

1368
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,800
big dial in.

1369
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,180
I think with the kids.

1370
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,150
I enjoy it though.

1371
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:20,391
I mean,

1372
00:35:20,391 --> 00:35:20,541
I,

1373
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:21,340
I w you know what,

1374
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,240
we've talked about this
a long time ago and I,

1375
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:27,920
you know about how hard it is as a
comedian and especially when you go on the

1376
00:35:27,921 --> 00:35:29,560
road and you know,

1377
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:32,390
cause I try not to do
anything with the waitresses,

1378
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,313
waitstaff,

1379
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,220
seriously.

1380
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:34,321
I,

1381
00:35:34,321 --> 00:35:35,390
so I'd rather have like a,

1382
00:35:35,391 --> 00:35:35,661
you know,

1383
00:35:35,661 --> 00:35:36,620
if I'm going to be with somebody,

1384
00:35:36,621 --> 00:35:37,560
I'd rather it be like a,

1385
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:38,280
uh,

1386
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,920
some nut from the box in the supermarket.

1387
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:44,910
It comes to the show.

1388
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,973
But the,

1389
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:47,731
for them,

1390
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:51,420
like it's a thrill to get a guy
like Tom Herrera cause like,

1391
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,610
oh this crazy ass holes coming into town.

1392
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,960
You get to toss their world
upside down for a couple of days,

1393
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,850
give her a kiss on the cheek and,

1394
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,320
and you don't name drop,

1395
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,700
you don't Brag and name drop.

1396
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,543
They love that.

1397
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,740
They love when you don't.

1398
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:05,820
How come you didn't tell me that?

1399
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:06,720
Well I don't think come up,

1400
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,651
you know what I mean?

1401
00:36:07,651 --> 00:36:08,461
Like it's a very,

1402
00:36:08,461 --> 00:36:11,600
it's an interesting kind of trick
because you really like Whoa,

1403
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,620
withholding the bragging to make you look,

1404
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,403
you know,

1405
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,100
humble brags seriously.

1406
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,900
If you ever seen humble brags on Twitter.

1407
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,160
It's a really funny,

1408
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,350
I'm in the humble brag book.

1409
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,423
You're in the book.

1410
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,810
I said something like,

1411
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,673
are you serious?

1412
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,750

and somebody's like,

1413
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:27,961

1414
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:28,950
you're in this book.

1415
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:29,933
That's hilarious.

1416
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,650
That's hilarious.

1417
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,151
What is that though?

1418
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:34,660
Is that a website or not?

1419
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:35,790
It's like a Twitter tag.

1420
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,890
Humblebrag when someone
says something like,

1421
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:38,341
wow,

1422
00:36:38,341 --> 00:36:40,860
I can't believe I got
nominated for this today.

1423
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,200
I totally didn't expect this.

1424
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:43,831
You know what I mean?

1425
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:44,121
Well,

1426
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:44,431
yeah,

1427
00:36:44,431 --> 00:36:49,350
you just letting everybody know you
got nominated with your like fake self

1428
00:36:49,351 --> 00:36:51,130
deprecating booze shit.

1429
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,740
I hear this right here.

1430
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:53,311
It says,

1431
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:54,144
uh,

1432
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:54,660
uh,

1433
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,820
so Thursday I met John Mayer.

1434
00:36:56,821 --> 00:37:01,821
Friday I met 50 cent this rate at this
rate tonight I'm smoking weed with Jim

1435
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:02,903
Morrison and Terry Shiloh.

1436
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:04,670
That was at a homeless on a hump.

1437
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,453
Their kindness.

1438
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,760
I truly don't get what this means.

1439
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,970
What does it has the cadence,

1440
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,050
what does it say?

1441
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:16,950
It has the cadence.

1442
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:18,450
It's cut off whoever took this picture,

1443
00:37:18,451 --> 00:37:20,220
but it really doesn't stack up well.

1444
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:21,930
Whoever wrote that dumb,

1445
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,040
you're dumb person.

1446
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:23,341
You don't,

1447
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,360
you don't understand what he's saying.

1448
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,280
He's a regular guy who
met some famous people.

1449
00:37:26,281 --> 00:37:27,030
You fuck,

1450
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,721
I truly,

1451
00:37:27,721 --> 00:37:29,250
during Tet with this with me,

1452
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,800
it means you're a cunt.

1453
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,300
Yeah.

1454
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,720
I met John when you're doing comedy,

1455
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,330
which was we was doing comedy
at the store for a while.

1456
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,930
John Mayer.

1457
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:37,500
Yeah.

1458
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,730
You asked me about Connie Mcshane.

1459
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:39,540
Paul's,

1460
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:39,841

1461
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:40,520
that's right.

1462
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,353
Yeah.

1463
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,820
Louis C K scary.

1464
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,150
We used to do is thing in Montreal.

1465
00:37:45,151 --> 00:37:48,370
It was so fucking funny where
I literally used to love it.

1466
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:49,861
Oh Shit.

1467
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:50,011
That's,

1468
00:37:50,011 --> 00:37:50,844
is that your phone?

1469
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,720
Your phone is the Beatles,

1470
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,360
but he got a bad song.

1471
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:54,721
I was like,

1472
00:37:54,721 --> 00:37:55,520
damn,

1473
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,000
dom Irrera sorry.

1474
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,640
He's got one of them old flip phones to,

1475
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,140
Oh,

1476
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,070
I got an iPhone.

1477
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,700
I got the first $5.

1478
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,710
It has no navigation up in that car.

1479
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,450
Has No idea where he's going.

1480
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,920
I had to text him directions.

1481
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,890
God helped the people that were behind
him as he was reading that shit.

1482
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,090
People are twittering,

1483
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,890
tweeting.

1484
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:14,180
Oh,

1485
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,230
there you have it set up so
that when people tweet to you,

1486
00:38:16,231 --> 00:38:17,064
it goes to your phone.

1487
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,350
I don't know that it's not good.

1488
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,860
Daughter did it worse.

1489
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,390
Do you want to change that right now?

1490
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,290
Because these fucking animals just found
that shit out to kill your battery.

1491
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:25,501
Better.

1492
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:28,620
Shut your phone off son
or change your settings.

1493
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:29,701
Yeah.

1494
00:38:29,701 --> 00:38:30,391
Shut that shit off.

1495
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,470
Cause when it's going to explode,

1496
00:38:31,471 --> 00:38:32,330
when it comes back on,

1497
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,380
they just found out they could get you.

1498
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,070
People just found out they could reach

1499
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,060
you with just a tweet.

1500
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,020
Do you understand that?

1501
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,831
That's insane.

1502
00:38:38,831 --> 00:38:39,850
You can't let them do that.

1503
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:45,580
You know when I first got your
phone will explode about Israel.

1504
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:46,871
No,

1505
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:47,471
you just got back,

1506
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:47,700
right?

1507
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,533
I didn't go,

1508
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:49,443
but I didn't go.

1509
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,160
Everybody in my family this,

1510
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,900
you know when it peaked,

1511
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,010
right?

1512
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,140
Remember when it peaked like the,

1513
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,680
the danger and they said they didn't up.

1514
00:38:56,681 --> 00:39:00,160
There's going to be a war and then
they started the bombs hit Tel Aviv and

1515
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:01,810
Jerusalem for the first time in 40 years.

1516
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:02,710
I remember that.

1517
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,100
Yes.

1518
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:03,431
Okay.

1519
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:07,660
So I had to make a decision and
Jeremy Hotz was coming with me,

1520
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,530
terrific comedian,

1521
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,630
cannon and a w.

1522
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,201
I said,

1523
00:39:11,201 --> 00:39:11,351
look,

1524
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:14,890
I'm going to pull out because my
whole family doesn't want me to go.

1525
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:16,900
All my friends don't want me to go.

1526
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,191
And the guy says,

1527
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:19,630
but give me three days.

1528
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:19,931
I said,

1529
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:21,760
what does is fiddler
on the roof three days?

1530
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:22,241
Like you're going to,

1531
00:39:22,241 --> 00:39:23,710
what are you going to
talk to the Palestinians?

1532
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:24,320
You know,

1533
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,153
the promoter.

1534
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,171
So he says,

1535
00:39:26,171 --> 00:39:26,771
give me three days.

1536
00:39:26,771 --> 00:39:27,131
And I said,

1537
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:27,550
look,

1538
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:27,941
he goes,

1539
00:39:27,941 --> 00:39:28,960
don't watch the news.

1540
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:29,823
It will poison you.

1541
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:30,281
I said,

1542
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:32,710
that's like saying that hurricanes come
and don't watch the weather channel.

1543
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:33,544
It's depressing.

1544
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,890
Anyway,

1545
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:38,590
so I canceled and it'd be
giving them enough time.

1546
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,670
There was an article in the,

1547
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:42,850
in the Jerusalem Post
about how like we were,

1548
00:39:42,851 --> 00:39:45,400
we didn't care about victims
from terror of terrorism,

1549
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,230
you know,

1550
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,140
it's just the opposite.

1551
00:39:47,141 --> 00:39:49,210
I was the only took the
gig because they were,

1552
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:50,170
it was helping people,

1553
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,000
you know what I mean?

1554
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
The article about you don't care about
it added me and Jeremy and the guy who

1555
00:39:56,621 --> 00:39:57,400
promoted it,

1556
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,390
I'm not going to name him,

1557
00:39:58,391 --> 00:39:59,080
but he didn't,

1558
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,820
he posted it four times,

1559
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,110
you know,

1560
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:02,711
and then he said,

1561
00:40:02,711 --> 00:40:03,850
he didn't realize about you.

1562
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,680
Write it down on a piece of
paper and slide it over here.

1563
00:40:05,681 --> 00:40:06,514
And I'll name him.

1564
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,211
No,

1565
00:40:07,211 --> 00:40:08,044
I don't want to do that.

1566
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,423
It's not worth it.

1567
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:09,911
Well,

1568
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:10,181
okay,

1569
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:11,180
let's not name him then,

1570
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,400
but it's not about any asshole that,

1571
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:16,030
that it's mad at you cause you
didn't want to go to a war.

1572
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,490
Yeah,

1573
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:19,090
until my brother is a
colonel in the marines.

1574
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,953
My brother Joe,

1575
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:20,311
he's,

1576
00:40:20,311 --> 00:40:21,310
he's almost a general,

1577
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,780
he's done that hand.

1578
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:23,231
The house,

1579
00:40:23,231 --> 00:40:24,700
the house combat crazy shit.

1580
00:40:24,701 --> 00:40:25,310
I told you that.

1581
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:25,760
Yeah.

1582
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,411
He told me,

1583
00:40:26,411 --> 00:40:26,801
he goes,

1584
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:27,491
hold on a second.

1585
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:30,070
He looked something up on the
computer hotspots in the world.

1586
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:30,341
He goes,

1587
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:31,660
I take a rain check on this one.

1588
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,370
And he told me not to go.

1589
00:40:33,371 --> 00:40:34,630
He told you not to know.

1590
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,940
And he said it because
my other brothers said,

1591
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,211
all right,

1592
00:40:37,211 --> 00:40:37,751
you're caring.

1593
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:38,531
Brothers says one thing,

1594
00:40:38,531 --> 00:40:39,760
let's call the crazy brother.

1595
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,170
And the crazy one said,

1596
00:40:41,171 --> 00:40:41,770
don't go.

1597
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:42,071
Yeah.

1598
00:40:42,071 --> 00:40:43,480
You know what the issue is dumb.

1599
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:47,800
It's like so far everything has been,

1600
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,430
the casualties have been capped,

1601
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,880
like at least mildly in check.

1602
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,570
But it doesn't mean that someone
can't do something fucking crazy.

1603
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,800
And it might not happen.

1604
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,641
And it might be,

1605
00:40:57,641 --> 00:40:58,121
you know,

1606
00:40:58,121 --> 00:41:01,930
a few people die here and few people
respond and die here and might be the way

1607
00:41:01,931 --> 00:41:04,330
it's coming on or might be an event.

1608
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:04,601
Right.

1609
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:06,460
I'm totally sympathetic
to these people too.

1610
00:41:06,461 --> 00:41:11,170
It's not like I do care and sterilely
situations for refrigerator.

1611
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:11,370
No.

1612
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:13,540
And I was afraid of not getting bombed.

1613
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,710
That's so random.

1614
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,170
I was afraid of the airport
getting bombed and stucked yeah.

1615
00:41:17,171 --> 00:41:19,410
Getting stuck there and you
have to think about that,

1616
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,880
cause it's not like I can go
to Damascus can catch a flight.

1617
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,661
It's not like,

1618
00:41:22,661 --> 00:41:22,871
you know,

1619
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:27,820
if you're in Europe and they're an
airline goes on Air France goes on strike,

1620
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:28,810
you just drive to Spain.

1621
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:29,560
Yeah.

1622
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,000
But it ain't like that in the Middle East.

1623
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:31,930
It's not like that at all.

1624
00:41:31,931 --> 00:41:35,030
And that is one of the that people use.

1625
00:41:35,031 --> 00:41:36,230
If they're attacking a city,

1626
00:41:36,231 --> 00:41:37,490
they'll attack the airport.

1627
00:41:37,491 --> 00:41:38,850
So they keep us goods the,

1628
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:39,980
anyways,

1629
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:40,760
yeah,

1630
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,593
that's what they do.

1631
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,740
It's this is,

1632
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:43,821
it's a very,

1633
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:45,350
very volatile situation.

1634
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:47,300
And you could have gone over there
and you could have been fine.

1635
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:47,690
Oh,

1636
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,130
he could have got over there
and you could have died.

1637
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:49,520
Yeah.

1638
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,070
It's like that's reality in
those parts of the world.

1639
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:57,071
It's like we have this sort
of a ridiculous notion that,

1640
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:57,920
uh,

1641
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,150
because we're safe over here because a
wood that we don't really have to think

1642
00:42:02,151 --> 00:42:02,860
about that shit too.

1643
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:02,960
Well,

1644
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,950
the world is smaller now.

1645
00:42:03,951 --> 00:42:05,660
There was a time when it did mean a lot.

1646
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,410
Like,

1647
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:06,561
you know,

1648
00:42:06,561 --> 00:42:08,570
the fact that we were isolated over here,

1649
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,310
away from Europe and Asia,

1650
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:10,791
you know,

1651
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:11,590
as far as fighting.

1652
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:11,841
That's why,

1653
00:42:11,841 --> 00:42:12,620
you know what I mean?

1654
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,350
There was a time when it now
everything's so instantaneous.

1655
00:42:15,351 --> 00:42:15,680
They would,

1656
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,630
they could get inside people.

1657
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,720
Terrorists could do something
here if they want to do,

1658
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,680
I'm one's been watching homeland.

1659
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:22,800
I haven't seen him live.

1660
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,810
Good fucking show.

1661
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:23,991
You know,

1662
00:42:23,991 --> 00:42:26,750
I was with one of the leads last week
and then not to be a name dropper because

1663
00:42:26,751 --> 00:42:27,680
I don't even remember his name.

1664
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,260
Russell Peters.

1665
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,980
We were going to have the dinner and uh,

1666
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:31,790
to be an excellent,

1667
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,020
Peter's knows everyone famous.

1668
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:37,010
He's fucking hilarious
is and having a party.

1669
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,851
Here's my number.

1670
00:42:37,851 --> 00:42:38,710
Mix Master man.

1671
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,350
Come up.

1672
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:42,320
He's the only one that
brought a posse to my podcast.

1673
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,420
They said,

1674
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:43,720
Russell,

1675
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:43,941
you bring,

1676
00:42:43,941 --> 00:42:45,050
bringing a fucking posse.

1677
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,400
Brings posses everywhere.

1678
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,790
Nice House too.

1679
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,510
Can I plugged that podcast?

1680
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,770
Dom Rare live from the laugh factory.

1681
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,180
Let's talk about doing another podcast.

1682
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,160
Let's talk about doing
a sobriety chronicles.

1683
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:56,871
I'm telling you,

1684
00:42:56,871 --> 00:43:00,200
it'd be hilarious and it would be
a method to keep you from drinking.

1685
00:43:00,201 --> 00:43:03,080
I know you don't want to drink because
I know how you felt when you weren't

1686
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:03,441
drinking.

1687
00:43:03,441 --> 00:43:04,071
When we're talking,

1688
00:43:04,071 --> 00:43:04,611
we're playing pool,

1689
00:43:04,611 --> 00:43:04,821
you're like,

1690
00:43:04,821 --> 00:43:05,720
I feel better.

1691
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,980
I feel I'm just nice to not feel like
shit and I'm able to up quicker and ping

1692
00:43:09,981 --> 00:43:10,490
pong.

1693
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:11,660
I'm sure you can tell much better.

1694
00:43:11,661 --> 00:43:12,420
I felt dumb.

1695
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,590
You don't have to drink to have
a good time with these clubs,

1696
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:16,040
you know?

1697
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:16,570
And uh,

1698
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:16,770
I'm,

1699
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:19,190
I'm not saying that you
should try pot because,

1700
00:43:19,191 --> 00:43:19,800
uh,

1701
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,580
you,

1702
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:23,780
you don't need to even change your state
of consciousness if you don't want to.

1703
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:24,241
I can.

1704
00:43:24,241 --> 00:43:25,270
I still do Xanax.

1705
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:27,650
You tell me why one.

1706
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:28,460
No,

1707
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:28,800
no,

1708
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,990
it wasn't good at that stuff.

1709
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,093
I'll tell you Joe,

1710
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:32,931
I don't know though.

1711
00:43:32,931 --> 00:43:33,561
You're listen,

1712
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:34,880
I'm sure I don't need that.

1713
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,430
It's hanging out the club
to impossible not to drink.

1714
00:43:37,431 --> 00:43:38,720
I tried every day.

1715
00:43:38,721 --> 00:43:39,554
I'm at a comment,

1716
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,070
hey,

1717
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,380
you just see everyone else drinking.

1718
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,060
I'm laughing and having fun
though when you're on the road.

1719
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,220
I went to the laugh factory
last night and I had some water.

1720
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,241
Yeah,

1721
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:48,680
you can go up and have fun,

1722
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:48,891
man.

1723
00:43:48,891 --> 00:43:49,724
You don't need to.

1724
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,790
All right,

1725
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,190
so this is my life.

1726
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,000
I'm in Australia.

1727
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,410
I'm at the Sydney Opera House,

1728
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:54,950
right?

1729
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:55,783
One week,

1730
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,770
the next week I met Mr Magoo bees.

1731
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,230
Joe Cass and I'm alone.

1732
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:01,730
But the girls are nice.

1733
00:44:01,731 --> 00:44:02,810
I'm having a drink with the money.

1734
00:44:02,811 --> 00:44:03,180
You know,

1735
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:03,591
what do I do?

1736
00:44:03,591 --> 00:44:04,424
I go back to my,

1737
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:05,160
well,

1738
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,380
sometimes it's fun.

1739
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:06,621
Look,

1740
00:44:06,621 --> 00:44:07,880
I'm not saying you shouldn't drink.

1741
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:08,571
I love drink.

1742
00:44:08,571 --> 00:44:08,691
Yeah,

1743
00:44:08,691 --> 00:44:09,120
but I,

1744
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:09,920
I agree with,

1745
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,970
but I don't do it every day.

1746
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,820
But you're in a lot fucking
better shape than me.

1747
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:13,011
You know,

1748
00:44:13,011 --> 00:44:13,731
you can drink.

1749
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:14,564
I shouldn't drink.

1750
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:14,871
Well,

1751
00:44:14,871 --> 00:44:15,441
even me,

1752
00:44:15,441 --> 00:44:16,160
I feel it.

1753
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,950
I feel it when I drank and I
feel the difference in my body.

1754
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,120
It's just not good for you.

1755
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:20,901
It's not smart.

1756
00:44:20,901 --> 00:44:21,411
And I don't,

1757
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:22,280
I don't have an issue with it.

1758
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:23,330
I can take it or leave it.

1759
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,141
I like it.

1760
00:44:24,141 --> 00:44:24,531
I like it.

1761
00:44:24,531 --> 00:44:25,190
Look with a meal.

1762
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:26,300
I like some wine with a meal,

1763
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,130
but I can take it or leave it.

1764
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:28,640
What I,

1765
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,960
what I think is important though is when
you can't take something or leave it,

1766
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:33,100
when you have to take it,

1767
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,820
that's sort of a situation
where you've got a really wore,

1768
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:35,951
well,

1769
00:44:35,951 --> 00:44:37,150
what is this thing doing to me?

1770
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,190
Is this thing that I
can't take as helping me?

1771
00:44:39,191 --> 00:44:42,040
Do I feel better or is it
fucking with my whole life?

1772
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:42,701
And for you,

1773
00:44:42,701 --> 00:44:43,990
I think it fucks with your whole life,

1774
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:44,651
you know?

1775
00:44:44,651 --> 00:44:46,590
And I agree and I love you and I,

1776
00:44:46,591 --> 00:44:48,910
I love seeing that you were sober,

1777
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:50,050
you know,

1778
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:50,591
and you know,

1779
00:44:50,591 --> 00:44:51,880
I'm not captain save a hoe.

1780
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,151
I mean,

1781
00:44:52,151 --> 00:44:53,530
you do whatever the fuck you want to do.

1782
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,393
You know how I am.

1783
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,680
I give people advice if they want it.

1784
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:57,790
And I,

1785
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:58,760
you and I have had this,

1786
00:44:58,761 --> 00:44:59,230
uh,

1787
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,610
this conversation many,

1788
00:45:00,611 --> 00:45:03,550
many times and it never really told
you what you should do or shouldn't do.

1789
00:45:03,551 --> 00:45:05,320
I sort of just let you talk and you know,

1790
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:06,790
and asked you questions and,

1791
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:07,950
but if,

1792
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:09,250
if you wanted my advice,

1793
00:45:09,251 --> 00:45:09,971
my advice would say,

1794
00:45:09,971 --> 00:45:10,930
you gotta stop drinking.

1795
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,190
It's not good for you.

1796
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:13,750
How they look great.

1797
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:16,900
But it's,

1798
00:45:16,901 --> 00:45:17,680
uh,

1799
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,310
it's one of those things like some people
can have a drink every now and again

1800
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:24,340
and some people can't do that and all of
a sudden it creeps up and becomes your

1801
00:45:24,341 --> 00:45:25,174
whole day.

1802
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:25,750
Yeah.

1803
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,583
Well it doesn't become,

1804
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:27,320
but it does.

1805
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,570
It's definitely creep back up.

1806
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,111
But for you,

1807
00:45:29,111 --> 00:45:31,090
you were doing like drinks
in the morning like,

1808
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:31,781
oh,

1809
00:45:31,781 --> 00:45:32,770
that was awhile ago.

1810
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:33,580
Yeah.

1811
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:33,970
But that's,

1812
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,020
that became your whole day,

1813
00:45:35,021 --> 00:45:35,590
right?

1814
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:36,310
No,

1815
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:37,150
not my whole day.

1816
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,780
I mean,

1817
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,700
I would do a drink in
the morning on a plane,

1818
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:44,170
but I wasn't sitting at home having a
shots before I get out of bed that night.

1819
00:45:44,171 --> 00:45:44,620
You know,

1820
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,180
not like last weekend kind of thing.

1821
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:47,410
Will you drinking alone?

1822
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,273
Yeah.

1823
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:53,960
Oh,

1824
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,660
I love it.

1825
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:59,030
Why are you sitting on a toilet?

1826
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,280
I mean,

1827
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,113
look,

1828
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:03,410
people

1829
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:04,370
that liked to drink and like,

1830
00:46:04,371 --> 00:46:06,030
this is annoying man
lift to go and beat him.

1831
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:06,430
So good.

1832
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,263
Good drink.

1833
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:07,840
Um,

1834
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,421
I just,

1835
00:46:08,421 --> 00:46:09,171
I didn't know what you,

1836
00:46:09,171 --> 00:46:09,681
I know you're,

1837
00:46:09,681 --> 00:46:11,000
when you're reaching out a little bit,

1838
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:13,190
and I know when you keep
mentioning this stuff,

1839
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:15,080
it's not because it's
not fucking with you.

1840
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:15,520
Yeah.

1841
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,100
You know?

1842
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:16,281
Well,

1843
00:46:16,281 --> 00:46:16,611
you know,

1844
00:46:16,611 --> 00:46:17,810
we go to that pool hall,

1845
00:46:17,811 --> 00:46:18,644
I don't need to drink.

1846
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:19,260
Right.

1847
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:19,940
I'm fine.

1848
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:20,773
I'm fine.

1849
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,620
You know,

1850
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:22,860
just racking a boss for you,

1851
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,960
I guess.

1852
00:46:23,961 --> 00:46:24,830
Be a good shame.

1853
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,221
Well,

1854
00:46:25,221 --> 00:46:25,551
you,

1855
00:46:25,551 --> 00:46:26,384
um,

1856
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:26,970
you know,

1857
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:28,010
started playing better too.

1858
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:28,671
Yeah.

1859
00:46:28,671 --> 00:46:29,870
Everything works better.

1860
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,250
So I go look drunk.

1861
00:46:31,251 --> 00:46:32,084
It's fun.

1862
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,433
I enjoy it.

1863
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,070
I enjoy it,

1864
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:34,711
but it's got,

1865
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:34,950
damn,

1866
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:35,720
it's bad on the bottom.

1867
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,860
Nobody ever says something like,

1868
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:37,440
Hey,

1869
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,273
you look good.

1870
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:39,920
What are you drinking again?

1871
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:41,960
Really got it together.

1872
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:42,531
But it's not,

1873
00:46:42,531 --> 00:46:42,951
you know,

1874
00:46:42,951 --> 00:46:46,490
they say like a glass of wine every
night and it's not even bad for it.

1875
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,331
And matter of fact,

1876
00:46:47,331 --> 00:46:48,260
it might be beneficial,

1877
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:49,640
an ounce of alcohol,

1878
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:54,350
whether it's in a beer wine or it's
supposed to be good for your circulation.

1879
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:55,251
Well,

1880
00:46:55,251 --> 00:46:55,581
you know,

1881
00:46:55,581 --> 00:46:58,760
people used to drink wine with food
because they thought it prevented food

1882
00:46:58,761 --> 00:46:59,594
poisoning,

1883
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:02,390
prevented travelers
poison travelers sickness.

1884
00:47:02,391 --> 00:47:05,180
They would call it because back then
when they were traveling around those

1885
00:47:05,181 --> 00:47:09,970
assholes with drinking wine out of like
animal skins and showing like that they

1886
00:47:09,971 --> 00:47:12,560
made like these flasks
out of animal skins.

1887
00:47:12,561 --> 00:47:13,610
That's how they drank their wines.

1888
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,740
I rationalized too because I go,

1889
00:47:15,741 --> 00:47:19,190
I only had two drinks but they're two
martinis are like eight shots each of them

1890
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,380
and there are two jumbo drinks to imagine
how hard it must have been carried

1891
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,233
food back then.

1892
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:26,250
I mean they probably
all got food sickness,

1893
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:26,871
you know,

1894
00:47:26,871 --> 00:47:27,740
because Oh my God,

1895
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,430
how long was meat stay good.

1896
00:47:29,431 --> 00:47:30,780
A couple of hours after he killed it.

1897
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:31,021
I mean,

1898
00:47:31,021 --> 00:47:32,190
how many of you have a day?

1899
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:32,731
What do you have?

1900
00:47:32,731 --> 00:47:33,810
And it's 80 degrees outside.

1901
00:47:33,811 --> 00:47:34,644
Do you have two days?

1902
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,220
I know that's a question you have about,

1903
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:36,850
uh,

1904
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:37,790
people bitching about it.

1905
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:39,220
The plane being in a half hour late,

1906
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:39,720
right.

1907
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,350
And comedians say like,

1908
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:41,651
Oh,

1909
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:46,090
you actually trying to write a bit about
it because the idea of taking a year to

1910
00:47:46,091 --> 00:47:47,750
go across the country and you know,

1911
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:50,250
getting stuck at the Donner
pass because it's snow.

1912
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:51,251
How fucking crate.

1913
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:51,970
Imagine like,

1914
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:52,490
where are you going?

1915
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:53,261
I got to go to bed.

1916
00:47:53,261 --> 00:47:55,040
I've got a Gig at San Francisco when?

1917
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:55,540
Oh,

1918
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,373
next June.

1919
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:57,250
In a year.

1920
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:57,491
Oh,

1921
00:47:57,491 --> 00:47:57,721
really?

1922
00:47:57,721 --> 00:47:58,600
You better get some rest.

1923
00:47:58,601 --> 00:47:58,961
You know what I mean?

1924
00:47:58,961 --> 00:47:59,260
It's like,

1925
00:47:59,260 --> 00:47:59,530
yeah,

1926
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:00,340
we just take it like,

1927
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,510
fuck the half hour late,

1928
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:02,344
son of a bitch.

1929
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:02,521
Well,

1930
00:48:02,521 --> 00:48:04,740
you want to really wrap your
head around a crazy number.

1931
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:05,460
Here's the,

1932
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,520
here's the craziest number between the,

1933
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,040
uh,

1934
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:14,040
v Invention of the airplane and the
dropping of an atomic bomb from the

1935
00:48:15,421 --> 00:48:15,960
airplane.

1936
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,310
It was less than 50 years.

1937
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:18,723
Wow.

1938
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,590
Talk about a life change in that.

1939
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:23,140
Yeah.

1940
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,010
Hitler fucked up.

1941
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:26,070
Hitler fucked up shit.

1942
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:27,490
It never really needed the Jews.

1943
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:28,690
They want it for us.

1944
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,010
Bernard von Braun.

1945
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:30,810
Yeah.

1946
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:31,021
Well,

1947
00:48:31,021 --> 00:48:31,291
yeah.

1948
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:31,680
Well,

1949
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,580
Oppenheimer,

1950
00:48:32,581 --> 00:48:32,850
right?

1951
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:34,020
He was the guy that created it.

1952
00:48:34,021 --> 00:48:35,550
Wernher von Braun was the NASA guy.

1953
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:36,631
What was his name?

1954
00:48:36,631 --> 00:48:37,650
The guy that did the atom bomb?

1955
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:38,900
No,

1956
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:39,733
that's Oppenheimer.

1957
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:41,340
Wernher von Braun was,

1958
00:48:41,341 --> 00:48:41,730
um,

1959
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:44,070
the guy who supposedly got us on the moon,

1960
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,230
son of a bitch.

1961
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,240
He's the guy from operation paperclip.

1962
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:48,841
The,

1963
00:48:48,841 --> 00:48:48,961
uh,

1964
00:48:48,961 --> 00:48:51,870
all the best Nazi scientists from,

1965
00:48:51,871 --> 00:48:52,704
or Jewish.

1966
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:53,940
We're Jewish,

1967
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:54,301
weren't they?

1968
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:56,190
At first they came over there.

1969
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,590
I Dunno if they were not a,

1970
00:48:58,591 --> 00:48:59,490
but all the best.

1971
00:48:59,491 --> 00:49:04,491
Nazi scientists were a sort of a
distributed between Russia and the United

1972
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,410
States after World War II.

1973
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:08,210
And,

1974
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:08,520
uh,

1975
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,230
America started,

1976
00:49:10,231 --> 00:49:10,680
uh,

1977
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:10,921
you know,

1978
00:49:10,921 --> 00:49:11,211
they,

1979
00:49:11,211 --> 00:49:12,720
they started with Wernher von Braun.

1980
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,740
They got Wernher von Braun and all these
different Nazi dudes under operation

1981
00:49:16,741 --> 00:49:17,221
paperclip,

1982
00:49:17,221 --> 00:49:18,780
but they were all like legit Nazis.

1983
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:22,410
That's one of the dark secrets
of the American space program.

1984
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:23,150
There was,

1985
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:24,110
it was run by Nazis.

1986
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,340
Wernher von Braun was a legit Nazi,

1987
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:28,350
like if he was alive today,

1988
00:49:28,351 --> 00:49:31,650
the Simon Wiesenthal Center said they
would prosecute him for crimes against

1989
00:49:31,651 --> 00:49:32,310
humanity.

1990
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:32,820
Wow.

1991
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:36,840
Apparently he had a rocket factory in
Berlin and there was this guy who did this

1992
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:38,530
documentary on m and a,

1993
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:39,361
the Moon landings,

1994
00:49:39,361 --> 00:49:40,710
and he interviewed,

1995
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:41,250
uh,

1996
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:43,080
people that worked in the rocket factory.

1997
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,190
This guy had tattoos from being the
concentration camp and he talked about how

1998
00:49:47,191 --> 00:49:48,050
wonderful I'm Brown.

1999
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:53,160
Like they would hang the five slowest
Jews in front of the rocket factory every

2000
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:53,450
day.

2001
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,110
I think it was like really dark,

2002
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:56,600
dark education lunch.

2003
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:57,670
It's not,

2004
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:57,930
I mean,

2005
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:00,810
that's beyond hate in humanity.

2006
00:50:00,811 --> 00:50:02,100
It's like that regime,

2007
00:50:02,101 --> 00:50:03,820
that Nazi regime there,

2008
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:08,670
that ruthlessness also yielded
some incredible science.

2009
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,950
I mean the scientific achievements,

2010
00:50:10,951 --> 00:50:14,070
it just in the rocketry and engine
engine building and you know,

2011
00:50:14,071 --> 00:50:14,261
the,

2012
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:14,401
the,

2013
00:50:14,401 --> 00:50:15,990
the shit that they were able to do.

2014
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:19,500
And then Russia scoop some of them
up and we scooped some of them up.

2015
00:50:19,501 --> 00:50:22,500
And that's where the autonomy
it was invented here.

2016
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:23,430
Yeah.

2017
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:24,450
Manhattan project.

2018
00:50:24,451 --> 00:50:24,601
Yeah.

2019
00:50:24,601 --> 00:50:25,560
That was Oppenheimer.

2020
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,480
It was that he a,

2021
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,201
I mean,

2022
00:50:28,201 --> 00:50:29,190
it sounds pretty Jewish.

2023
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,420
Is Oppenheimer Jewish.

2024
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:31,470
It must be right,

2025
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:32,303
of course.

2026
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:33,150
Of course.

2027
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:33,983
Of course.

2028
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:35,411
Of course.

2029
00:50:35,411 --> 00:50:37,450
Let's not forget that the
best speaking to Jews,

2030
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,470
I'm Christmas Eve.

2031
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:40,503
I'm doing it.

2032
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,111
Do what?

2033
00:50:41,111 --> 00:50:41,944
His synagogue,

2034
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:44,140
the synagogue and a,

2035
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:44,520
uh,

2036
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,030
the laugh factory has a show,

2037
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,350
a Jewish show.

2038
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:48,040
Oh really?

2039
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:48,730
Yeah.

2040
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:49,630
I love that.

2041
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:50,583
Nice.

2042
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:51,483
Um,

2043
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:53,290
you have where you have
a Gig on New Year's Eve,

2044
00:50:53,291 --> 00:50:53,700
where yet?

2045
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,060
Um,

2046
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:54,480
at the,

2047
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:54,940
uh,

2048
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:56,440
good nights in North Carolina.

2049
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:56,711
Oh,

2050
00:50:56,711 --> 00:50:57,310
that's right.

2051
00:50:57,310 --> 00:50:57,550
Yeah.

2052
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:59,530
Which I'm really looking
forward to not only the club,

2053
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:00,160
uh,

2054
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,700
but my family's down there and Mike,

2055
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:03,910
I got a lot of friends in Raleigh

2056
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,690
so I'm looking to see if he was Jewish.

2057
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,030
It does not say,

2058
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,180
dammit.

2059
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,620
We showed this on a podcast before.

2060
00:51:13,621 --> 00:51:15,450
That is not to experiment
with the dog head.

2061
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:16,111
Yeah.

2062
00:51:16,111 --> 00:51:18,630
They had electrical impulses into the dog.

2063
00:51:18,631 --> 00:51:21,030
Hadn't made it move after
is detached from the body.

2064
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:22,021
Oh yeah,

2065
00:51:22,021 --> 00:51:23,850
they did some banking look
that looks real right there.

2066
00:51:23,851 --> 00:51:24,170
Yeah.

2067
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:25,080
That dog is alive.

2068
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,670
Do they did some crazy shit.

2069
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:31,530
The Nazis did some crazy shit and they
were really obsessed with the cult.

2070
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:32,401
That's,

2071
00:51:32,401 --> 00:51:33,270
that's really weird.

2072
00:51:33,271 --> 00:51:34,590
I wonder how much of it is uh,

2073
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:35,101
you know,

2074
00:51:35,101 --> 00:51:35,600
um,

2075
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,380
sort of revisionist bullshit that
like these reality TV shows try to,

2076
00:51:40,381 --> 00:51:40,710
uh,

2077
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:43,750
to do these sort of half
documentary type shows.

2078
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:45,240
Like I love,

2079
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,020
um,

2080
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,610
ancient aliens a fun show,

2081
00:51:47,611 --> 00:51:49,590
but the reality is they
get a lot of shit wrong.

2082
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,590
Like they're not trying to be like
super duper accurate about some of their

2083
00:51:52,591 --> 00:51:53,424
stuff.

2084
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:55,740
And so like when they
say something like that,

2085
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:56,040
the,

2086
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:56,680
that the,

2087
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,010
the Nazis were really into the call.

2088
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,800
I really wish I knew how
much into the cult they were.

2089
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:04,380
That was a theme of like
Indiana Jones and the template.

2090
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:05,680
You know,

2091
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,550
remember the old Raiders of the lost Ark
when they found the Ark of the covenant

2092
00:52:08,551 --> 00:52:11,070
that was supposed to be the Nazis
were after all this a culture.

2093
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:11,430
Yeah.

2094
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:12,960
Apparently they had like a reputation.

2095
00:52:12,961 --> 00:52:13,411
I really,

2096
00:52:13,411 --> 00:52:14,760
we should educate myself on that.

2097
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,833
Find out how,

2098
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:18,270
how deep that was and what
the fuck that was all about.

2099
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:20,911
But this guy,

2100
00:52:20,911 --> 00:52:21,510
uh,

2101
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:22,343
Oppenheimer,

2102
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:23,303
one of the creepiest,

2103
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:24,143
you look at it that now.

2104
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:24,511
Yeah.

2105
00:52:24,511 --> 00:52:25,201
When he,

2106
00:52:25,201 --> 00:52:25,530
uh,

2107
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:26,100
when,

2108
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,570
when he blew up the,

2109
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:28,800
the nuclear bomb,

2110
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:29,941
he,

2111
00:52:29,941 --> 00:52:30,420
uh,

2112
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,830
he quoted the Bhagavad Gita is
this ancient Hindu religious text.

2113
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:35,401
It said,

2114
00:52:35,401 --> 00:52:36,810
now I am become death.

2115
00:52:36,811 --> 00:52:38,490
The destroyer of worlds.

2116
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,210
Wow.

2117
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:41,220
Could you imagine standing next to a dude?

2118
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:41,540
No.

2119
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:45,300
So fucking smart that he
created an atomic bomb,

2120
00:52:45,301 --> 00:52:49,440
like his inventions let gave birth of
the atomic bomb and then you're standing

2121
00:52:49,441 --> 00:52:51,810
next to him why it blows up and
he quotes that kind of shit.

2122
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:53,400
Like he's happy about it.

2123
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:54,383
He's not happy.

2124
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,680
He wasn't happy at all.

2125
00:52:55,681 --> 00:52:56,710
He thought it was a terrible term.

2126
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:57,390
Oh really?

2127
00:52:57,390 --> 00:52:58,020
Yeah.

2128
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:02,010
Well a lot of these guys that are
scientists that the real issue is,

2129
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:03,990
and becoming a scientist,

2130
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:04,680
you're,

2131
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:04,981
you're,

2132
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:07,710
you're pursuing knowledge.

2133
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:08,790
You're pursuing the,

2134
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:09,031
the,

2135
00:53:09,031 --> 00:53:11,040
the measurement of a,

2136
00:53:11,041 --> 00:53:11,500
of a,

2137
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,690
of different experiments.

2138
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:12,911
And,

2139
00:53:12,911 --> 00:53:13,210
and,

2140
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:13,410
and,

2141
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:14,041
and you're,

2142
00:53:14,041 --> 00:53:17,640
you're trying to invent
and create with technology,

2143
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:19,110
but at a certain point in time,

2144
00:53:19,111 --> 00:53:21,450
you must know that if you
continue down this path,

2145
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:24,840
it's going to lead to insane
amounts of people dying.

2146
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:26,430
And in your mind,

2147
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:27,750
it's a battle now,

2148
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:27,980
but it,

2149
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,880
cause it's because as a scientist,

2150
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:30,743
as a,

2151
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,590
as a,

2152
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:33,540
a person is trying to achieve a goal,

2153
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:36,120
you wanted to see if you can
be the first person to do this.

2154
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:39,750
You want to see if you can be the first
person to split an atom inside of bomb

2155
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,441
and lead.

2156
00:53:40,441 --> 00:53:42,360
To this incredible explosion of energy.

2157
00:53:42,361 --> 00:53:43,194
You want to be,

2158
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,100
you want to do that,

2159
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:45,690
but then you have to realize like,

2160
00:53:45,691 --> 00:53:45,901
wow,

2161
00:53:45,901 --> 00:53:46,830
if I do do that,

2162
00:53:46,831 --> 00:53:48,270
what the fuck am I really doing?

2163
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:49,171
Like I'm,

2164
00:53:49,171 --> 00:53:49,530
I am,

2165
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:51,300
I am the only way this can get done.

2166
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:52,680
And then there's the argument,

2167
00:53:52,681 --> 00:53:52,771
well,

2168
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:53,341
if you don't do it,

2169
00:53:53,341 --> 00:53:54,330
the Nazis are going to do it.

2170
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:55,500
We have to do it argument.

2171
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:56,880
That's what the argument was.

2172
00:53:57,270 --> 00:54:02,220
And so this guy was caught in there
and he got there first and when he said

2173
00:54:02,221 --> 00:54:02,940
that,

2174
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:03,151
you know,

2175
00:54:03,151 --> 00:54:08,151
that that became one of the creepiest
quotes ever a attributed to anybody that's

2176
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:11,940
responsible for anything
like really monumental.

2177
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:17,330
I had read that a lot of the scientists
we got were Jews who left Nazi Germany

2178
00:54:17,611 --> 00:54:18,444
when they could get out.

2179
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:19,410
I bet there was that too.

2180
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:20,910
I'm sure there was that as well.

2181
00:54:20,911 --> 00:54:21,121
I mean,

2182
00:54:21,121 --> 00:54:21,954
that's Einstein.

2183
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:22,710
Yeah.

2184
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:23,100
Um,

2185
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:23,701
but I think,

2186
00:54:23,701 --> 00:54:24,310
um,

2187
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,640
the rocketry program in particular,

2188
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,190
the NASA got a lot of,

2189
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:29,720
uh,

2190
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:30,000
they were,

2191
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,750
they were still a lot of no Germans.

2192
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,810
There were never Nazis.

2193
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:36,020
It was a operation paperclip and meeting.

2194
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:38,850
And how many of them were Nazis because
their families were forced into that

2195
00:54:38,851 --> 00:54:39,720
because there were stuck there.

2196
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,760
How many of were Nazis because they
were really fucking psychopath creeps.

2197
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:47,040
Who knows how many of them are
actually responsible for murder?

2198
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,713
I don't know.

2199
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:50,400
I would love to know what
he was saying though.

2200
00:54:50,401 --> 00:54:53,010
Cause you got to admit the
guy was a riveting performer.

2201
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:54,263
Hitler,

2202
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:56,850
charismatic speaker.

2203
00:54:56,851 --> 00:54:57,670
I mean I thought,

2204
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:59,350
do you ever see pictures of cruise chef?

2205
00:54:59,610 --> 00:54:59,850
Yes.

2206
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:01,440
When he took his shoe off and bang,

2207
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:01,711
Hey,

2208
00:55:01,711 --> 00:55:04,940
well Barry you fuck takes
their shoe or for the Yulin?

2209
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:06,063
Yeah.

2210
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:07,383
Yeah.

2211
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:09,930
Do you remember that fear that we had?

2212
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:11,810
You know there was a oh yeah.

2213
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:12,181
Of,

2214
00:55:12,181 --> 00:55:14,310
of being in a nuclear war with Russia.

2215
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:15,180
Sure.

2216
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:15,720
And it was on,

2217
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:16,530
it was all the time.

2218
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:18,810
We always felt it like that was a,

2219
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,110
like in the eighties Dan was like,

2220
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:23,100
especially because there
was no internet back then,

2221
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,910
we didn't know what the
fuck was really going on.

2222
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:25,351
Button.

2223
00:55:25,351 --> 00:55:25,801
The red,

2224
00:55:25,801 --> 00:55:28,220
the red phone picking it,

2225
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:28,460
you know,

2226
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,820
the president had that power.

2227
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,340
But you would get your news like from,

2228
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:32,730
you know,

2229
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:36,270
either newspapers or the news shows
that that's where you got your news.

2230
00:55:36,271 --> 00:55:39,420
I wonder if it ever came
close to a nuclear war.

2231
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:39,871
Well,

2232
00:55:39,871 --> 00:55:40,681
they say that,

2233
00:55:40,681 --> 00:55:41,040
uh,

2234
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,300
the Bay of pigs,

2235
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:43,440
they say the bay of Pigs,

2236
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:44,520
it got pretty close.

2237
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,280
Yeah.

2238
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,113
Yeah.

2239
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:49,990
Jerry here about their Russian sleep
experiment that they did back in the,

2240
00:55:49,991 --> 00:55:50,651
uh,

2241
00:55:50,651 --> 00:55:52,510
I want to say the 1940s,

2242
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:55,750
they wanted to keep five prisoners awake.

2243
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,400
I meant the Cuban missile crisis,

2244
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:58,570
not a bay of pigs,

2245
00:55:58,571 --> 00:55:58,901
but no,

2246
00:55:58,901 --> 00:55:59,560
what did they do?

2247
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,130
They wanted to keep a five people wait,

2248
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,620
they took five prisoners
and they said like,

2249
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:04,170
Hey,

2250
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:04,490
uh,

2251
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:07,450
we went to do some experiments on
here and then we'll let you go.

2252
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:08,600
So for a,

2253
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:11,470
I think the first five
days everyone was kind of,

2254
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:12,363
you know,

2255
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:13,361
fine,

2256
00:56:13,361 --> 00:56:13,781
you know,

2257
00:56:13,781 --> 00:56:18,070
and then it went from them like
screaming like four hours at a time.

2258
00:56:18,071 --> 00:56:19,630
Like get me Outta here.

2259
00:56:19,631 --> 00:56:21,520
And like they had microphones in this,

2260
00:56:21,521 --> 00:56:22,840
like in this pen,

2261
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:23,580
it was like,

2262
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:23,861
you know,

2263
00:56:23,861 --> 00:56:27,700
a sealed kind of thing that had no
windows and they had microphones.

2264
00:56:27,701 --> 00:56:28,990
So they could record everybody,

2265
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,880
what they we talked about and stuff,

2266
00:56:30,881 --> 00:56:31,960
and they started going crazy.

2267
00:56:31,961 --> 00:56:34,750
They start screaming and everything
and they were pumping this room,

2268
00:56:34,751 --> 00:56:35,170
fill,

2269
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:38,190
there's some gas and test gas
that they were trying to exclude.

2270
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:40,240
It could keep soldiers
up for 10 days at a time,

2271
00:56:40,241 --> 00:56:40,810
you know?

2272
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:41,260
Uh,

2273
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:43,450
and so then all the
people started screaming.

2274
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,470
Then they were quiet.

2275
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:46,180
Then all the scientists were like,

2276
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:50,140
I think the microphones aren't working
when they're not making any noises at

2277
00:56:50,141 --> 00:56:50,860
all.

2278
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:52,920
And so they go in there and uh,

2279
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:53,291
they're all,

2280
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:54,580
the people are just very calm.

2281
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:56,920
They didn't want to leave
anymore and stuff like that.

2282
00:56:56,921 --> 00:56:57,850
And then when they experiment,

2283
00:56:57,851 --> 00:56:58,684
it's over.

2284
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,100
They wouldn't leave.

2285
00:57:00,101 --> 00:57:01,960
Like they were like fighting.

2286
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,100
They,

2287
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,840
they wanted to stay in this chamber.

2288
00:57:04,841 --> 00:57:05,291
They started,

2289
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:06,400
people started like,

2290
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:09,340
I guess people started like killing
themselves because they didn't want to go,

2291
00:57:09,341 --> 00:57:11,260
like ripping their throats
out and stuff like that.

2292
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:11,720
Yeah.

2293
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,070
And there's,

2294
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:14,560
there's a video on youtube called,

2295
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,950
what is the exact name of
the Russian sleep experiment?

2296
00:57:17,951 --> 00:57:18,460
It's on,

2297
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:19,930
it's on youtube and there's a bigger,

2298
00:57:19,931 --> 00:57:22,690
I think it's what the
microphones recorded.

2299
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:23,480
I'm,

2300
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,220
I'm remembering this now,

2301
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:29,390
but I think I might've in my own
head incorporated it into that.

2302
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,760
Do you remember that movie
in the mouth of madness?

2303
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:32,963
No.

2304
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:36,890
It was a movie about a dude who
was an author went fucking crazy.

2305
00:57:36,891 --> 00:57:40,370
And I think I attributed
some of the aspects of his,

2306
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:40,871
the,

2307
00:57:40,871 --> 00:57:44,920
the book had some weird power over
people when they read the book that gets

2308
00:57:44,921 --> 00:57:46,550
sucked into this crazy world.

2309
00:57:46,551 --> 00:57:47,900
Like the world around them would change.

2310
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:49,190
Really fascinating book.

2311
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:50,480
Um,

2312
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,620
I forget who wrote it.

2313
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:53,011
I want to say it,

2314
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:53,571
Stephen King,

2315
00:57:53,571 --> 00:57:56,810
but it's not the mouth of madness.

2316
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:57,230
Yeah.

2317
00:57:57,230 --> 00:57:57,700
Uh,

2318
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:01,300
there's a website called
creepy Pasta Wiki or whatever,

2319
00:58:01,301 --> 00:58:02,920
just typing the Russian sleep experiment.

2320
00:58:02,921 --> 00:58:04,260
There's the whole story and he goes,

2321
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,040
he breaks it down per hour.

2322
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:07,210
And then like how,

2323
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,260
how people just,

2324
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:09,850
they started going crazy and,

2325
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:11,263
and uh,

2326
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:12,301
the,

2327
00:58:12,301 --> 00:58:12,580
uh,

2328
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:12,790
the,

2329
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:14,420
the movie moving the mouth of mantises,

2330
00:58:14,421 --> 00:58:14,840
uh,

2331
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,110
it's a John Carpenter movie.

2332
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,220
Creepy ass movie.

2333
00:58:17,221 --> 00:58:18,120
It's a really good movie.

2334
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:18,751
But,

2335
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:18,931
uh,

2336
00:58:18,931 --> 00:58:19,111
I,

2337
00:58:19,111 --> 00:58:21,000
for some reason I incorporated that.

2338
00:58:21,001 --> 00:58:22,620
I guess that is like a real news story.

2339
00:58:22,621 --> 00:58:24,090
I incorporated that in my memory.

2340
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:27,060
That's just goes to show you how
like memories can be faulty as,

2341
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:28,560
you know,

2342
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:32,490
I incorporated that
reality into a fake memory.

2343
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:36,230
I guess some one of the people were
hurt and they tried to give him an

2344
00:58:36,231 --> 00:58:37,550
anesthesia and the guy was like,

2345
00:58:37,551 --> 00:58:38,870
I must remain awake.

2346
00:58:38,871 --> 00:58:38,991
You know,

2347
00:58:38,991 --> 00:58:39,771
I must stay awake.

2348
00:58:39,771 --> 00:58:40,190
Like they,

2349
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:41,023
whoa.

2350
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,293
Uh,

2351
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,133
yeah.

2352
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:45,690
It's interesting though.

2353
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,460
I read it if,

2354
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,780
when you get a chance to
read this whole thing,

2355
00:58:47,781 --> 00:58:49,670
are you sure this is not fiction?

2356
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,590
I always thought it was real.

2357
00:58:51,591 --> 00:58:53,990
I've heard that there's
people that questioned it,

2358
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:54,280
uh,

2359
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:54,730
because of the,

2360
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:56,360
based on the youtube video,

2361
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:59,030
because the youtube video
is just the microphone.

2362
00:58:59,031 --> 00:59:00,080
So I think a lot of people are like,

2363
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:00,861
and that's not real.

2364
00:59:00,861 --> 00:59:02,030
It's somebody just bullshitting,

2365
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:02,271
you know?

2366
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:05,810
Cause at one point they do start
screaming and running around and stuff,

2367
00:59:05,811 --> 00:59:06,221
but I don't,

2368
00:59:06,221 --> 00:59:06,461
I don't,

2369
00:59:06,461 --> 00:59:06,530
I,

2370
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:06,741
you know,

2371
00:59:06,741 --> 00:59:08,090
I never really researched it.

2372
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:09,410
Uh,

2373
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:10,131
it's something,

2374
00:59:10,131 --> 00:59:10,964
uh,

2375
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:12,350
that I heard a long time ago.

2376
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:14,623
Hmm.

2377
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:16,400
But yeah,

2378
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,040
I'm sure Internet will tell
me if it's real or not.

2379
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:21,080
So if it's on the Internet,

2380
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:21,831
it's gotta be true.

2381
00:59:21,831 --> 00:59:22,550
Right?

2382
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:23,030
Yeah.

2383
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:25,280
I wanna I wanna I wanna
find out if this is true.

2384
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,510
Should I go to Snopes?

2385
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:29,030
Is the Russian experiment
sleep experiment?

2386
00:59:29,031 --> 00:59:29,864
True?

2387
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:32,693
Huh?

2388
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:34,201
Yeah.

2389
00:59:34,201 --> 00:59:36,120
I need to find this out
because we can't keep,

2390
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:37,250
it helps to make sure.

2391
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,071
It's interesting though,

2392
00:59:38,071 --> 00:59:38,300
right?

2393
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:38,650
Right.

2394
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:43,650
This information p people get
so aggro with correcting us.

2395
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:44,911
Joe,

2396
00:59:44,911 --> 00:59:48,210
you're F you're spreading false knowledge.

2397
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:50,970
I try so hard to get shit right.

2398
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:53,690
When did get mad because
I called the Hamp,

2399
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:53,950
uh,

2400
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:55,590
a cousin of marijuana.

2401
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:57,540
[inaudible] says it's a cousin,

2402
00:59:57,541 --> 00:59:59,010
like everywhere online,

2403
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,710
everywhere you read just Google cousin,

2404
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,060
I think marijuana from him.

2405
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:04,740
He be see has it?

2406
01:00:04,741 --> 01:00:05,551
It's a strain.

2407
01:00:05,551 --> 01:00:08,220
It's a different strain and
it's the male of the species.

2408
01:00:08,221 --> 01:00:09,630
And I understand that.

2409
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,930
And this guy was saying that I
was spreading dish information.

2410
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,630
It's like people like are like jumping up,

2411
01:00:15,631 --> 01:00:18,000
trying to catch you
saying something wrong.

2412
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:20,430
So when we have something like this,

2413
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:22,140
yeah,

2414
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:22,591
this is a way,

2415
01:00:22,591 --> 01:00:23,880
a nice way to say thanks folks.

2416
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:24,541
Okay.

2417
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:25,321
And if something's wrong,

2418
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:25,891
say hey,

2419
01:00:25,891 --> 01:00:29,730
I think maybe there's a dispute
about the definition of this.

2420
01:00:29,731 --> 01:00:30,564
Or Hey,

2421
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:31,740
maybe you didn't know.

2422
01:00:31,741 --> 01:00:33,390
But even though everybody
calls it a cousin,

2423
01:00:33,391 --> 01:00:34,260
it's something else.

2424
01:00:34,261 --> 01:00:35,040
Or Hey,

2425
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:35,461
maybe,

2426
01:00:35,461 --> 01:00:36,294
you know,

2427
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:38,130
just be nice folks.

2428
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,120
Don't be all conti.

2429
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:42,160
I have to stop with the disinformation.

2430
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:43,380
Like you're doing it on purpose.

2431
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:47,220
I have two friends that are lawyers and
one of them always ends the argument by

2432
01:00:47,221 --> 01:00:47,491
going,

2433
01:00:47,491 --> 01:00:48,324
you're wrong.

2434
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:49,230
Oh God.

2435
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:50,490
So that shuts it all down.

2436
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,353
Oh God.

2437
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,730
Those that,

2438
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:54,930
those guys are just so gross.

2439
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:56,431
You can't,

2440
01:00:56,431 --> 01:00:57,360
you have a conversation,

2441
01:00:57,361 --> 01:00:58,194
you weak bitch,

2442
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:01,740
have a conversation with someone who
has a completely different point of view

2443
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,090
from you and take it in.

2444
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:07,140
That's why I don't talk politics because
I've never seen anybody go at the end

2445
01:01:07,141 --> 01:01:08,160
of the political discussion.

2446
01:01:08,161 --> 01:01:08,994
You know what?

2447
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:09,833
You got a good point.

2448
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:11,460
I think I'm going to change my mind you,

2449
01:01:11,461 --> 01:01:15,180
there's an issue with a lot of men
socially when it comes to arguing about

2450
01:01:15,181 --> 01:01:17,250
things and that issue is
they're trying to win.

2451
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:17,680
Yeah.

2452
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:17,970
You know,

2453
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:18,660
they're not just,

2454
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:21,480
they're not comfortable with themselves
enough to just be themselves.

2455
01:01:21,481 --> 01:01:21,780
Right.

2456
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:25,680
They're trying to establish societal
dominance is trying to establish a social

2457
01:01:25,681 --> 01:01:26,514
dominance.

2458
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:27,040
I,

2459
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:27,150
uh,

2460
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:27,900
you know,

2461
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,010
I have a friend,

2462
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:29,970
okay.

2463
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:30,803
Just

2464
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:31,780
very nice person.

2465
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:32,260
Um,

2466
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:33,940
who has a husband the name over,

2467
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:34,480
I won't,

2468
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,640
who has a husband and a,

2469
01:01:36,641 --> 01:01:38,470
when I'm forced to interact with the sky,

2470
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:43,210
it always becomes this weird thing where
he tries to like brag about something

2471
01:01:43,211 --> 01:01:43,660
or,

2472
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:43,931
yeah.

2473
01:01:43,931 --> 01:01:44,231
And it's,

2474
01:01:44,231 --> 01:01:46,180
it's this weird social thing.

2475
01:01:46,181 --> 01:01:46,570
Yeah.

2476
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:47,403
And it might be like,

2477
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:51,390
he'll try to crack a subtle
joke at you or you know what,

2478
01:01:51,391 --> 01:01:52,300
but whatever it is,

2479
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:54,970
it's this weird like uncomfortable,

2480
01:01:54,971 --> 01:01:56,740
like posturing thing that goes on.

2481
01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:57,280
Yeah.

2482
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:57,930
And so when I'm,

2483
01:01:57,930 --> 01:01:58,160
I'm,

2484
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,080
I'm around him,

2485
01:01:59,081 --> 01:02:00,790
I always like treat it
like a research subject.

2486
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:01,181
I was like,

2487
01:02:01,181 --> 01:02:01,720
wait,

2488
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:01,961
what?

2489
01:02:01,961 --> 01:02:02,890
Did you know what,

2490
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,870
what throws it off exactly.

2491
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:05,290
You know,

2492
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:06,660
what do we have to do to,

2493
01:02:06,661 --> 01:02:06,850
uh,

2494
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:08,530
to get them to stop doing shit?

2495
01:02:08,531 --> 01:02:08,890
I just,

2496
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:09,611
what should I do this time?

2497
01:02:09,611 --> 01:02:10,750
Should I just agree with them?

2498
01:02:10,751 --> 01:02:11,231
We'll go off for sure.

2499
01:02:11,231 --> 01:02:12,060
Amazing.

2500
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:12,401
I say,

2501
01:02:12,401 --> 01:02:12,581
no,

2502
01:02:12,581 --> 01:02:12,830
you,

2503
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:14,710
there are a really amazing guy.

2504
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,480
Your wife is so fortunate,

2505
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:16,721
you know,

2506
01:02:16,721 --> 01:02:17,450
change my life,

2507
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:18,550
make them really uncomfortable.

2508
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:20,100
We hang out together more.

2509
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,360
Cause I think I can learn from you.

2510
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:22,920
There's just something about you.

2511
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:23,943
And what'd he do?

2512
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:24,900
Progressive,

2513
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:25,733
you know,

2514
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:27,420
mock them or do you,

2515
01:02:27,421 --> 01:02:28,620
do you call them out on it?

2516
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,020
I wouldn't call them out.

2517
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:33,060
I think it's like the guy
who was the Israel thing.

2518
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,380
When I found out that he had
posted this thing four times,

2519
01:02:37,381 --> 01:02:38,430
I called him up and I says,

2520
01:02:38,431 --> 01:02:39,030
you know,

2521
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:40,680
really look forward to
working with you again.

2522
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:41,910
I understand you're coming in today.

2523
01:02:41,911 --> 01:02:42,744
If you need a,

2524
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:44,860
I could send the car
for her at the airport.

2525
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:48,120
Or if I kept myself totally
just being fucking evil,

2526
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:49,111
I was,

2527
01:02:49,111 --> 01:02:49,944
you know,

2528
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:51,301
but instead of like,

2529
01:02:51,301 --> 01:02:52,111
don't fuck you.

2530
01:02:52,111 --> 01:02:53,370
And then he's got that recorded.

2531
01:02:53,371 --> 01:02:53,701
It's like,

2532
01:02:53,701 --> 01:02:54,534
hey man,

2533
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:55,800
thank you for doing that.

2534
01:02:55,801 --> 01:02:56,431
I appreciate it.

2535
01:02:56,431 --> 01:02:57,750
The exposure in Israel,

2536
01:02:57,810 --> 01:02:58,170
it's,

2537
01:02:58,170 --> 01:02:58,501
look,

2538
01:02:58,501 --> 01:02:59,670
it's indefensible.

2539
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:03,690
The fact this guy wanted you to fly into
a war zone is fucking nuts to tell some

2540
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:04,590
jokey jokes,

2541
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:05,220
guys,

2542
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:05,900
an asshole.

2543
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:06,270
You know,

2544
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:08,940
he didn't like the fact that it would
give us deposit back or whatever the fuck

2545
01:03:08,941 --> 01:03:09,660
went wrong.

2546
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:10,231
But guess what,

2547
01:03:10,231 --> 01:03:10,680
Dude?

2548
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:15,150
That's part of what goes on when you're
dealing with shit in a war zone and it's

2549
01:03:15,151 --> 01:03:17,180
not the fucking entertainers fault.

2550
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:19,260
They don't want to fly
into a fucking war zone.

2551
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:19,711
And the guy,

2552
01:03:19,711 --> 01:03:22,080
the writer apologized and he said,

2553
01:03:22,081 --> 01:03:24,990
we gotta be careful not to get
comedians that they're skittish.

2554
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:26,220
So in other words,

2555
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:27,091
you know,

2556
01:03:27,091 --> 01:03:28,800
I'm sorry for what I said,

2557
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,690
but these guys are pussies.

2558
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,610
Skiddish skiddish yeah.

2559
01:03:32,611 --> 01:03:33,060
You know,

2560
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:36,040
I don't think you used the word
skittish when there's bombs,

2561
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:38,490
he's skittish around bomb.

2562
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:41,310
If there's actual bombs going off,

2563
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,950
attacks from getting shot at,

2564
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:45,150
is it a real war?

2565
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:45,481
Oh,

2566
01:03:45,481 --> 01:03:46,650
it's a real war.

2567
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:47,630
Ha.

2568
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:47,970
And you're,

2569
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:48,270
yeah,

2570
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:49,770
I think you might be a little harsh.

2571
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,350
Skiddish you'd judgemental cunt face.

2572
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:53,790
Where does this guy live?

2573
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,050
That shit.

2574
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:55,560
Which one?

2575
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,550
The guy who booked this shit.

2576
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:56,701
Oh,

2577
01:03:56,701 --> 01:03:57,180
here.

2578
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:57,810
He lives here.

2579
01:03:57,810 --> 01:03:59,260
Oh yeah.

2580
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:00,830
It isn't live this and go over there.

2581
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:02,413
He goes over,

2582
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:03,383
but he doesn't live here.

2583
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:05,183
How dare he?

2584
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:06,660
Everyone's saying that Russian ships fake.

2585
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:07,521
Yeah.

2586
01:04:07,521 --> 01:04:11,170
Probably 2009 it was just like this
viral thing that went around a,

2587
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:15,080
it's a fictional piece of work that
appears to have started spreading a viral

2588
01:04:15,081 --> 01:04:17,090
fashion sometime in 2009 meanwhile,

2589
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:19,620
we were just contributing information.

2590
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:20,390
Brian.

2591
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:21,223
Alicia,

2592
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:25,510
that's good.

2593
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:26,660
It's a nice story.

2594
01:04:26,661 --> 01:04:28,020
That was really creepy.

2595
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:29,993
Creepy.

2596
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:30,770
Creepy.

2597
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,180
I remember from a while ago and I just,

2598
01:04:32,181 --> 01:04:32,511
you know,

2599
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,470
remember reading and going,

2600
01:04:33,471 --> 01:04:33,710
huh,

2601
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:34,940
that's crazy.

2602
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:35,790
Just to

2603
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:36,680
cool a p.

2604
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:38,040
It's not even a hoax.

2605
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:39,810
Apparently it was just a piece of fiction.

2606
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:40,440
Yeah.

2607
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:40,910
I liked this.

2608
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:41,700
Prevented,

2609
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,050
prevented all provigil.

2610
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:43,681
Yeah,

2611
01:04:43,681 --> 01:04:44,514
I could feel it.

2612
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,700
I feel like wide awake.

2613
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:46,760
Yeah.

2614
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:47,210
It's gonna.

2615
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:48,800
It's gonna kick in even later pulses.

2616
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,190
Your pulse elevated.

2617
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:50,900
No,

2618
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:51,051
we,

2619
01:04:51,051 --> 01:04:55,410
we learned about this shit from powerful
Dave Asprey and powerful Tim Ferris.

2620
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:56,251
It's an,

2621
01:04:56,251 --> 01:04:57,084
I just feel awake.

2622
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,080
I will say no more.

2623
01:04:59,580 --> 01:04:59,990
Yeah,

2624
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:00,781
but those guys can be,

2625
01:05:00,781 --> 01:05:01,614
if it works.

2626
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:02,453
No,

2627
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:02,901
that's the,

2628
01:05:02,901 --> 01:05:06,810
one of the cool things about having this
podcast is that I get to hang out and

2629
01:05:06,811 --> 01:05:10,440
talk to all these like dudes
way off the beaten path.

2630
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:12,120
It would never get to
communicate with like,

2631
01:05:12,121 --> 01:05:12,510
uh,

2632
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:14,640
this Guy Dave Asprey who's just see,

2633
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:17,100
I would guess you would call
him like a human performance.

2634
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:18,811
And he runs a,

2635
01:05:18,811 --> 01:05:19,081
a,

2636
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:20,050
a tech company.

2637
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,940
But on top of that,

2638
01:05:21,941 --> 01:05:26,941
he also like has this a website that
he puts out all this information about

2639
01:05:27,791 --> 01:05:32,670
health and fitness and he does
these brain hacking things and all,

2640
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,390
you had to find him just,

2641
01:05:34,391 --> 01:05:35,080
um,

2642
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:38,050
minimum line man met him
through a communicating online,

2643
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:38,681
you know,

2644
01:05:38,681 --> 01:05:42,120
people recommended has worked and they
checked him out and we had the guy in

2645
01:05:42,121 --> 01:05:42,251
here.

2646
01:05:42,251 --> 01:05:42,970
He's a guy,

2647
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:45,280
he's fucking super creepy genius.

2648
01:05:45,281 --> 01:05:46,510
It was one of those crazy,

2649
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:47,110
um,

2650
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,550
podcasts while like after it's over,

2651
01:05:48,551 --> 01:05:52,210
like you've got to go back with a piece
of paper and write down shit and Google

2652
01:05:52,211 --> 01:05:52,721
things.

2653
01:05:52,721 --> 01:05:53,320
And yeah,

2654
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,550
it was a crazy podcast.

2655
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:56,140
I learned a lot of stuff and like how,

2656
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,780
what are the odds of getting a
chance to talk to a guy like that?

2657
01:05:58,781 --> 01:06:00,190
If you didn't have a podcast like this,

2658
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:03,010
how would you get someone to sit down
with you for three hours and talk about

2659
01:06:03,011 --> 01:06:03,420
shit?

2660
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:03,890
Yeah.

2661
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:04,723
You know,

2662
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:05,281
I'm,

2663
01:06:05,281 --> 01:06:06,960
I'm always amazed by the mind.

2664
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:08,230
And I used to teach school.

2665
01:06:08,231 --> 01:06:11,350
I taught fourth grade and I was amazed
at how kids had different intelligence

2666
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:12,753
and how,

2667
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:13,091
like,

2668
01:06:13,091 --> 01:06:14,950
I remember I was really bad in math,

2669
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:16,270
but I knew every,

2670
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:18,490
the batting average of every,

2671
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:21,850
the top 10 players in American national
league without even thinking about it.

2672
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:23,320
I knew that er,

2673
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:26,620
they earned run average of the pictures
and that incredible the way your mind

2674
01:06:26,621 --> 01:06:27,431
accepts things.

2675
01:06:27,431 --> 01:06:29,950
And then I was like
fucking retarded in math.

2676
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:30,461
Yeah.

2677
01:06:30,461 --> 01:06:31,360
I always loved that I could,

2678
01:06:31,361 --> 01:06:33,390
I knew like Marvin Hagler record.

2679
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:33,970
Yeah.

2680
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:34,301
You know,

2681
01:06:34,301 --> 01:06:34,930
I knew,

2682
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:35,500
uh,

2683
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:36,700
who we lost to,

2684
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:37,750
what the decision was.

2685
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:38,291
You know,

2686
01:06:38,291 --> 01:06:40,210
I knew a Durand's record,

2687
01:06:40,211 --> 01:06:40,391
you know,

2688
01:06:40,391 --> 01:06:43,030
I could read you back like how,

2689
01:06:43,031 --> 01:06:43,510
you know,

2690
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:43,781
where,

2691
01:06:43,781 --> 01:06:48,730
where he had his first loss when he beat
can be Canon to get the title to watch

2692
01:06:48,731 --> 01:06:49,660
that whole fight the other night.

2693
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:50,321
Yeah,

2694
01:06:50,321 --> 01:06:50,741
I did.

2695
01:06:50,741 --> 01:06:51,400
Yeah,

2696
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:51,720
I pack.

2697
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:52,160
Yeah,

2698
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:52,990
yeah,

2699
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:53,201
yeah.

2700
01:06:53,201 --> 01:06:53,741
That was a,

2701
01:06:53,741 --> 01:06:54,574
that was crazy.

2702
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,170
It was crazy the way he walked into it.

2703
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,013
Huh?

2704
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,940
You can't let that and you can't
make that instantaneous mistake.

2705
01:06:59,941 --> 01:07:00,790
And boxing you'd done?

2706
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:04,750
I think he's got his attention
very stretched as well.

2707
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:07,150
There's a bunch of issues if pack.

2708
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:07,341
Yeah,

2709
01:07:07,341 --> 01:07:07,780
I think,

2710
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:10,030
I think one of the big
issues is that he's like,

2711
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:14,020
I don't think we can even wrap our
heads around how famous that guy is.

2712
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:14,300
Oh,

2713
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:15,133
in the Philippines,

2714
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:17,110
he's like a God,

2715
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:18,460
he's gonna be president.

2716
01:07:18,461 --> 01:07:19,810
He could be president of the Philippines.

2717
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:23,350
So there's that and he being
a congressman over there,

2718
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:26,950
well who knows what kind of crazy
fucking pressure that guys under,

2719
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:27,910
who knows?

2720
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:28,571
I don't understand.

2721
01:07:28,571 --> 01:07:29,321
Then on top of that,

2722
01:07:29,321 --> 01:07:33,520
he's trying to chain train and then
on top of that he's super famous,

2723
01:07:33,521 --> 01:07:34,620
so he's got to constantly do,

2724
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:35,920
be doing media things,

2725
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:37,190
constantly be doing interviews,

2726
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,060
was constantly talking to people and
then on top of that he has a family.

2727
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,340
Like that's a lot of shit.

2728
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:43,150
I don't,

2729
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:44,140
I don't know.

2730
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:45,070
I mean,

2731
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:46,510
I don't know if you could really do that.

2732
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:49,990
I think you could do it for a little while
because you were so good at boxing to

2733
01:07:49,991 --> 01:07:50,824
begin with.

2734
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:55,960
But I think he's at a point where his
skills have started to slip because of the

2735
01:07:55,961 --> 01:07:59,380
fact that he's not putting the same amount
of focus into it as it was because to

2736
01:07:59,381 --> 01:08:02,380
me the strategy and then on top of that
he's had a lot of wars and he's had a

2737
01:08:02,381 --> 01:08:03,340
lot of crazy fights.

2738
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:03,880
Yeah.

2739
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,220
I mean he wasn't getting hit too
much in other fights but man these,

2740
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:07,600
these God mark has fights.

2741
01:08:07,601 --> 01:08:08,890
Mark has just has his number.

2742
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:10,500
Some guys just have a,

2743
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,070
I think he was winning up to that point.

2744
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:12,790
Yes,

2745
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:13,390
yes I did.

2746
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:16,850
But he did get knocked down and he
got knocked down with one punch and a,

2747
01:08:16,851 --> 01:08:17,690
that was the first time.

2748
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:21,410
The first time he got knocked down you've
got knocked down like in like was like

2749
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:24,710
the fourth maybe and then he
got knocked out in the sixth.

2750
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:26,120
I understand him to go.

2751
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:28,250
That's the cleanest punch I've ever seen.

2752
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:32,960
Quick guy take like a guy that kind of
lightening speed cause he really looked

2753
01:08:32,961 --> 01:08:33,890
into it flush,

2754
01:08:33,891 --> 01:08:34,840
flush it.

2755
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:36,250
You couldn't hit a guy anyhow.

2756
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:36,970
Perfect.

2757
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:37,281
Any more.

2758
01:08:37,281 --> 01:08:40,580
Perfect mark has just
drilled it down the middle.

2759
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:43,940
Brilliant placement and when
you see the impact of it,

2760
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:44,391
we were,

2761
01:08:44,391 --> 01:08:48,530
we were watching it in a Dana White's
dressing room and when you see the impact

2762
01:08:48,531 --> 01:08:50,720
of Paki Owl's head fly back,

2763
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:54,230
you will like if they fell down face
first and then you see him fall down face

2764
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:54,740
first.

2765
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:56,640
We all just like leapt up who?

2766
01:08:56,641 --> 01:09:01,641
I was like who saw that comment because
Pacquiao was moving in on him like he

2767
01:09:02,121 --> 01:09:02,480
had heard.

2768
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,100
Mark has got a little bit too cocky.

2769
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:07,880
I looked up khaki cause I would love to
hit somebody like that without fear of

2770
01:09:07,881 --> 01:09:08,840
getting hit back.

2771
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:10,970
Well that's what I've always said.

2772
01:09:10,971 --> 01:09:11,990
Like people say like give,

2773
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:13,040
what did you food man.

2774
01:09:13,041 --> 01:09:18,041
Which food in the mu first of all
everybody wants to beat people up.

2775
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:19,640
No one wants to fight.

2776
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:20,800
Okay.

2777
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,290
Everybody that says things like that,

2778
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:23,840
you don't know what a fight is.

2779
01:09:23,841 --> 01:09:25,190
A fight as he gets to do that to you.

2780
01:09:25,191 --> 01:09:25,851
Too stupid,

2781
01:09:25,851 --> 01:09:29,810
but you know it's not a matter of who
vote could keep gay as I just go in there

2782
01:09:29,811 --> 01:09:30,644
and kick his butt.

2783
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:33,080
Then people who can also kick
ass going to kick your ass.

2784
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:33,831
You understand that,

2785
01:09:33,831 --> 01:09:34,310
right?

2786
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:34,731
Like you,

2787
01:09:34,731 --> 01:09:39,440
you have to be ready for the craziest
fucking competition known to man.

2788
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:40,850
That's what professional fighter.

2789
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:41,030
Yeah.

2790
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:42,080
Trains is a fighter.

2791
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:43,220
You can't just go kick ass.

2792
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:43,521
Okay.

2793
01:09:43,521 --> 01:09:44,354
It does.

2794
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:44,991
It was funny,

2795
01:09:44,991 --> 01:09:47,240
but people that talk about this guy,

2796
01:09:47,241 --> 01:09:49,430
he used to sell fucking
throw it through a wall.

2797
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:50,031
First of all,

2798
01:09:50,031 --> 01:09:51,350
when's the last time you were in a fight?

2799
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:53,023
Second Grade.

2800
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:54,020
You know what I mean?

2801
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:54,621
Like these guys,

2802
01:09:54,621 --> 01:09:55,800
they talk about fighting all the time.

2803
01:09:55,801 --> 01:09:56,570
I'm fucking killed.

2804
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:57,890
I'll break your fucking head.

2805
01:09:58,340 --> 01:09:59,210
You never did anything.

2806
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:01,010
There's a fighting Koolaid,

2807
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,110
a whole series of,

2808
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:02,990
hey koolaid.

2809
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:08,300
There's a whole series of dudes I've
met throughout my life who have told me

2810
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,820
that they can't lose
because of their mentality.

2811
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:12,950
It's this thing that guys will tell you,

2812
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,150
this fucking guy,

2813
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:15,343
it was a year ago,

2814
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:15,980
I told me,

2815
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:16,600
he goes,

2816
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:17,450
I'll tell you why man.

2817
01:10:17,451 --> 01:10:19,000
If I dedicated myself to MMA,

2818
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,450
if I dedicated myself,

2819
01:10:20,451 --> 01:10:21,284
I would dominate.

2820
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:22,303
Cause Dude,

2821
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,810
my mentality is I cannot
lose getting hit here,

2822
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:28,470
here and this nervous.

2823
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:28,710
Yeah,

2824
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:29,420
you can leave.

2825
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:32,630
And I have to sit there when a guy says
something like that and just non going,

2826
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:33,650
yeah,

2827
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:37,160
well good luck with that mentality
but you don't understand my mentality.

2828
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:40,820
I cannot lose when I get that in my
head and just make sure you don't fight

2829
01:10:40,821 --> 01:10:43,280
anybody and they always invade your
space when they're telling you this and

2830
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:43,940

There's a lot of people that are just
running around looking for someone to hit.

2861
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:18,900

2862
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:19,733

2866
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:23,131

2868
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:24,481
He goes,

2869
01:11:24,481 --> 01:11:24,631
yeah,

2870
01:11:24,631 --> 01:11:27,040
I want to see what it feels like
to get hit by professional box.

2871
01:11:27,041 --> 01:11:27,960

fucking guy and where he can't hit you.

2874
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:32,380
Right?

2875
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:32,970
And the guy goes,

2876
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:33,091
oh,

2877
01:11:33,091 --> 01:11:33,391
come on.

2878
01:11:33,391 --> 01:11:33,601
He goes,

2879
01:11:33,601 --> 01:11:33,871
all right,

2880
01:11:33,871 --> 01:11:34,830
well can I hit you?

2881
01:11:34,831 --> 01:11:36,120
Then I go,

2882
01:11:36,121 --> 01:11:37,530
well you get the fuck out of here.

2883
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:39,510
Can I hit you then what the fuck?

2884
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:40,110
I know.

2885
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:41,190
Can I hit you then?

2886
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:43,350
Can I give you a shot just
to show you how strong I am?

2887
01:11:43,351 --> 01:11:44,280
I'm just on the arm.

2888
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:46,280
I had a guy asked me if
he could carry me once.

2889
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:47,870
I think it would carry me.

2890
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:48,470
Okay.

2891
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,960
You inside?

2892
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:55,590
He put his jacket down over the puddle.

2893
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:57,500
He take a picture with me.

2894
01:11:57,530 --> 01:12:00,480
He wanted to hold me when
that's how he said it too.

2895
01:12:00,481 --> 01:12:01,314
He's like,

2896
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:05,880
no the fuck is wrong with you man.

2897
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:06,881
Big giant dude.

2898
01:12:06,881 --> 01:12:07,714
He was this big,

2899
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:10,150
he looked like it was a
native American long hair,

2900
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:11,043
long dark hair.

2901
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:11,983
Scary as fuck.

2902
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:15,010
Juicy fruit cause he had
no problem with that guy.

2903
01:12:15,730 --> 01:12:16,563
Take a while.

2904
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,090
Can I carry you?

2905
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:19,471
Come on.

2906
01:12:19,471 --> 01:12:21,490
Crazy like it.

2907
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:22,231

2912
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:30,800
Strange Fetish but understandable.

2913
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:31,800
Well you know when that's

2914
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:32,480

2915
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,340

thing when people like,

2916
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:35,380

2917
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:38,900
they're like super proud of like a
physical attribute that there were,

2918
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:39,680
you know,

2919
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:41,960
sort of born with like being
like really crazy tall,

2920
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:43,191
tall.

2921
01:12:43,191 --> 01:12:43,641
I am.

2922
01:12:43,641 --> 01:12:48,130
I'm just three fucking tall
being tall and all and like,

2923
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:50,360
it's a strange thing.

2924
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:51,290
You know,

2925
01:12:51,290 --> 01:12:51,651
I spent,

2926
01:12:51,651 --> 01:12:52,570
I guess suspect guys,

2927
01:12:52,571 --> 01:12:53,091

2928
01:12:53,091 --> 01:12:54,710

We do happy that they got a big Dick.

2930
01:12:57,110 --> 01:12:57,831
But listen man,

2931
01:12:57,831 --> 01:13:00,830
you could have easily been born with a
micro Dick's that you laugh out online.

2932
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:03,820
Back to didn't ask for that deck
and you didn't ask for your Dick.

2933
01:13:03,821 --> 01:13:04,654
You got lucky.

2934
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,320
What is that you're showing in the corner?

2935
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:08,000
People are saying that you are,

2936
01:13:08,030 --> 01:13:08,690
uh,

2937
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:11,390
undercover Russian spy
or something like that.

2938
01:13:11,450 --> 01:13:12,283
How's that?

2939
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,180
So I'm showing the KGB logo,

2940
01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:16,080
why they stay undercover west,

2941
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,940

2942
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:20,430
storage show.

2943
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:21,263
Yeah.

2944
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,400
It's fun to watch live feedback.

2945
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:24,473
Joe Doesn't like it.

2946
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:24,931
Well,

2947
01:13:24,931 --> 01:13:26,060
the problem is they'll,

2948
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:29,070
they will entertain your thoughts
with a lot of negative shit.

2949
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:30,040
Yeah.

2950
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:30,460
You know,

2951
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:30,851
and you,

2952
01:13:30,851 --> 01:13:31,810
you're inviting.

2953
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:32,141
I mean,

2954
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,280
every now and then it might be fun,

2955
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:35,470
but you were inviting too many,

2956
01:13:35,471 --> 01:13:36,070
uh,

2957
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:36,970
too many options.

2958
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,250
People really think
you're arrest alien or,

2959
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:40,310
or all that shit.

2960
01:13:40,311 --> 01:13:41,270
Like they're really,

2961
01:13:41,271 --> 01:13:43,430
people believe that you're part of the,

2962
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:43,660
yeah,

2963
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:44,361
the Illuminati.

2964
01:13:44,361 --> 01:13:45,051
I'm sure there's some,

2965
01:13:45,051 --> 01:13:45,500
look,

2966
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:49,400
there's a lot of people that are what
you call paranoid schizophrenia x and

2967
01:13:49,401 --> 01:13:50,240
that's legit.

2968
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:52,970
And that's not like a small
percentage of our population.

2969
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:53,571
You know,

2970
01:13:53,571 --> 01:13:54,080
there's like,

2971
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,190
I know several,

2972
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:55,850
I know,

2973
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:59,450
I know many people that have
like legit mental illnesses.

2974
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,650
I think it's super common.

2975
01:14:00,651 --> 01:14:01,130
Yeah.

2976
01:14:01,130 --> 01:14:05,090
So if you're a person with a
legit mental illness and you know,

2977
01:14:05,091 --> 01:14:06,380
you see someone on television,

2978
01:14:06,381 --> 01:14:10,570
you can get completely convinced that
they're involved in some sort of civic

2979
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:11,850
society to hold you down.

2980
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,950
I know a dude who's losing his mind,

2981
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,980
but that one dude we know who was
losing his mind thinks that everybody's

2982
01:14:16,981 --> 01:14:18,180
working for the fucking CIA.

2983
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,220
People being mind controlled and shit.

2984
01:14:23,221 --> 01:14:23,371
Like,

2985
01:14:23,371 --> 01:14:24,660
what are you like,

2986
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:25,410
stop,

2987
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:26,430
settle the fuck down.

2988
01:14:26,610 --> 01:14:27,600
It's much,

2989
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:31,340
there's much less conspiracy afoot than
people would like to see fit there.

2990
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:32,480
Then people would like to,

2991
01:14:32,490 --> 01:14:33,090
uh,

2992
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:33,923
like to believe.

2993
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:36,030
Have you ever been contacted
by any of these groups?

2994
01:14:36,031 --> 01:14:36,301
Like,

2995
01:14:36,301 --> 01:14:38,270
like Scientologists are Illuminati

2996
01:14:39,330 --> 01:14:39,691
ontology.

2997
01:14:39,691 --> 01:14:40,081
They seem to,

2998
01:14:40,081 --> 01:14:42,300
they have a lot of money and
then they protect their people.

2999
01:14:42,301 --> 01:14:43,134
Well,

3000
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:44,760
we have to rework some of your rules,

3001
01:14:44,970 --> 01:14:45,900
but I think we'll be fine.

3002
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:47,101
Yeah.

3003
01:14:47,101 --> 01:14:47,690
But I guess if you,

3004
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:49,010
not saying that religion did,

3005
01:14:49,011 --> 01:14:49,770
they,

3006
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:54,740
did they believe in God or they
believe they're a group about assets.

3007
01:14:55,170 --> 01:14:56,450
They're very successful.

3008
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,950
If you look at what Scientology has done,

3009
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:58,150
they're,

3010
01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:01,670
they're amazing at making money
and it managing their business,

3011
01:15:01,671 --> 01:15:05,630
their business of Scientology and amazing
at acquiring really expensive real

3012
01:15:05,631 --> 01:15:06,290
estate.

3013
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:08,990
I think they're like a big real
estate holder in Los Angeles.

3014
01:15:08,991 --> 01:15:11,060
They own like some really
big fucking buildings,

3015
01:15:11,061 --> 01:15:12,500
a lot of like really expensive stuff.

3016
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:13,693
So they're smart.

3017
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:14,810
That was all on Hubbard,

3018
01:15:14,811 --> 01:15:15,110
right?

3019
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:15,411
Yeah.

3020
01:15:15,411 --> 01:15:17,900
Well he's the guy who started it
has been dead for a long time.

3021
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,220
Do they think that,

3022
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:19,580
uh,

3023
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:21,560
did they believe in a god
or they believe their God,

3024
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,460
they believe aliens.

3025
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:26,330
They believe some crazy shit
written by l Ron Hubbard.

3026
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,620
That's what's really weird about it.

3027
01:15:27,621 --> 01:15:29,120
It's like they believe some,

3028
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:35,170
it seems to me that some people just need
a structure that needs some stuff that

3029
01:15:36,501 --> 01:15:38,660
tells them all the answers.

3030
01:15:38,690 --> 01:15:40,880
Every question that they have is answered,

3031
01:15:40,881 --> 01:15:42,440
whether it logical or not.

3032
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:47,800
Some people just need that base covered
and they'll take that base from time

3033
01:15:48,141 --> 01:15:49,370
tology of tea.

3034
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:53,450
They'll take that base from Buddhism
or they'll take that base from

3035
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:54,313
Christianity,

3036
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:56,210
they'll take that base from
whoever gets there first.

3037
01:15:56,330 --> 01:15:57,350
Whoever gets there first,

3038
01:15:57,410 --> 01:16:00,140
whoever's in the right position
who resonates with them the most,

3039
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:01,183
they'll accept that.

3040
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:03,620
And for something like Scientology,

3041
01:16:03,621 --> 01:16:06,380
one of the good things about Scientology
as opposed to a lot of the other

3042
01:16:06,381 --> 01:16:11,381
religions is there's a lot of like
pretty interesting principles that they,

3043
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:16,860
that they masked with in terms of
managing your consciousness in terms of

3044
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:20,060
positive thinking and accepting um,

3045
01:16:20,090 --> 01:16:20,320
uh,

3046
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,850
positive things in your
life and acting change.

3047
01:16:22,851 --> 01:16:24,620
Like then there's like a lot of like,

3048
01:16:24,621 --> 01:16:25,280
uh,

3049
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,350
like that's why dianetics
were so successful.

3050
01:16:27,351 --> 01:16:29,360
Like dianetics when they sold it on TV,

3051
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:32,960
you didn't know that you were becoming
a part of some sort of crazy religious

3052
01:16:32,961 --> 01:16:33,510
cult.

3053
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:35,600
The thought that you were
buying a self help book.

3054
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:36,321
And uh,

3055
01:16:36,321 --> 01:16:37,940
I bought a bunch of self help books,

3056
01:16:37,941 --> 01:16:38,180
man.

3057
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:39,710
I bought Tony Robbins Shit.

3058
01:16:39,711 --> 01:16:41,120
I listened to his books on tape.

3059
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:41,511
Yeah.

3060
01:16:41,511 --> 01:16:42,090
When I was a,

3061
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:43,250
when I was poor as fuck,

3062
01:16:43,251 --> 01:16:44,150
living in revere.

3063
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:44,990
Um,

3064
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:46,200
I used to live in cities.

3065
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:46,821
Yeah.

3066
01:16:46,821 --> 01:16:47,654
That's hilarious.

3067
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:49,540
I was well struggling comedian,

3068
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:53,180
I was listening to Anthony Robbins tapes
and just thinking about like how to

3069
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:54,150
make things happen.

3070
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:56,360
Like he's like really good motivator,

3071
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:56,931
you know,

3072
01:16:56,931 --> 01:16:58,270
and the,

3073
01:16:58,271 --> 01:16:59,750
the dianetics thing,

3074
01:16:59,751 --> 01:17:01,370
I thought it was this very similar,

3075
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,390
that's what I thought it was.

3076
01:17:02,690 --> 01:17:03,710
And then when I got it,

3077
01:17:03,711 --> 01:17:04,131
when I,

3078
01:17:04,131 --> 01:17:04,964
um,

3079
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:10,210
when I got the book they sent me
invitations to go to like the Scientology

3080
01:17:11,391 --> 01:17:12,590
center and all this different Shit.

3081
01:17:12,591 --> 01:17:14,840
They sent me them almost every month.

3082
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:17,630
They were relentless for years.

3083
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,280
Like if you are lost,

3084
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:21,830
they reach out and they just get you,

3085
01:17:21,831 --> 01:17:23,510
it's like this is pre internet.

3086
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:23,721
Okay.

3087
01:17:23,721 --> 01:17:25,100
Cause this is like 1994.

3088
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:29,390
So it was fascinating to me because
I didn't understand what it was.

3089
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:30,050
I didn't,

3090
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:30,950
we had no internet.

3091
01:17:30,951 --> 01:17:31,201
Okay.

3092
01:17:31,201 --> 01:17:32,150
We'll wrap your head around that.

3093
01:17:32,151 --> 01:17:32,720
People.

3094
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:33,553
So when I,

3095
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:36,350
if someone asked me what Scientology was,

3096
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,330
I had to like literally go to a store.

3097
01:17:38,331 --> 01:17:39,240
I had a bio book,

3098
01:17:39,241 --> 01:17:40,310
I had read it myself.

3099
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:44,900
So in reading this dianetics book and
then getting all these emails from these

3100
01:17:44,901 --> 01:17:45,351
males,

3101
01:17:45,351 --> 01:17:48,440
actual physical mail sent to
my mailbox from this group,

3102
01:17:48,441 --> 01:17:48,741
I was like,

3103
01:17:48,741 --> 01:17:49,850
what the fuck is this?

3104
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:53,690
So then it piqued my curiosity and then
I really looked into when I was like,

3105
01:17:53,691 --> 01:17:54,170
wow,

3106
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:54,720
this is a,

3107
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:55,580
this is amazing.

3108
01:17:55,581 --> 01:17:58,220
This is a cult and this is
ever going to get any of that.

3109
01:17:58,370 --> 01:17:58,640
No,

3110
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:58,791
no.

3111
01:17:58,791 --> 01:18:00,020
I never went to like
a meeting or anything,

3112
01:18:00,021 --> 01:18:03,890
but I did sit down with a dude and he
did that a stress test thing on me.

3113
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:04,670
What they did.

3114
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:04,891
Yeah,

3115
01:18:04,891 --> 01:18:05,081
yeah,

3116
01:18:05,081 --> 01:18:05,540
yeah.

3117
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:06,560
But that was way later.

3118
01:18:06,561 --> 01:18:07,940
That was like a couple of years ago.

3119
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:08,121
Well,

3120
01:18:08,121 --> 01:18:09,110
you definitely needed,

3121
01:18:09,111 --> 01:18:09,320
it.

3122
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,690
Didn't like the outcome
of that test was like,

3123
01:18:11,691 --> 01:18:12,890
you need to become a scientologist.

3124
01:18:12,891 --> 01:18:13,310
It was pretty,

3125
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:14,143
pretty clear.

3126
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:15,770
Um,

3127
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:16,160
it was,

3128
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:18,050
it's the most ridiculous device ever.

3129
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:18,740
Um,

3130
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:20,180
I'm sitting there and I don't think,

3131
01:18:20,181 --> 01:18:20,961
I wish that we had,

3132
01:18:20,961 --> 01:18:21,610
um,

3133
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:21,950
uh,

3134
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:25,100
Kara Santa Maria on who she could
explain us the science behind it and how

3135
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:27,590
woefully lacking it is and real science.

3136
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:28,970
But it gives,

3137
01:18:28,971 --> 01:18:29,804
you really does.

3138
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:30,810
But anyway,

3139
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:31,170
um,

3140
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:31,580
this,

3141
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:35,690
they would sit down with you and you
hold on to this e meter and even ask you

3142
01:18:35,691 --> 01:18:36,524
questions.

3143
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:38,750
And I don't remember the
nature of the questions,

3144
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:40,880
but I just remember it
being so ridiculous.

3145
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:42,470
And I remember asking like,

3146
01:18:42,471 --> 01:18:44,240
how many different things can affect this?

3147
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:44,600
You know,

3148
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,800
what about intent does
intent if effect it,

3149
01:18:46,801 --> 01:18:47,601
what if I get angry?

3150
01:18:47,601 --> 01:18:48,434
Does that affect it?

3151
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:52,880
So then I tried to just like think
of answers like in a fucked up way.

3152
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:55,790
So like really raised my craziness up.

3153
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:57,020
Oh No,

3154
01:18:57,070 --> 01:18:57,903
I,

3155
01:18:57,910 --> 01:19:02,180
I I I I'm not exactly sure cause
it was really high when I did this.

3156
01:19:02,690 --> 01:19:03,170
Um,

3157
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:04,340
but so it wasn't that long ago.

3158
01:19:04,341 --> 01:19:04,810
It wasn't,

3159
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:05,660
it was a couple years ago.

3160
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:06,321
It was,

3161
01:19:06,321 --> 01:19:07,154
um,

3162
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:08,540
I was filming,

3163
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:09,320
um,

3164
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,220
game show in my head.

3165
01:19:10,410 --> 01:19:11,243
Okay.

3166
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,840
We were down there cause so that was,

3167
01:19:12,841 --> 01:19:13,674
uh,

3168
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:15,750
that was pre before fear factor came out.

3169
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:16,800
So it was a couple of years ago,

3170
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,300
at least three years ago.

3171
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:18,930
Anyway,

3172
01:19:18,930 --> 01:19:19,650
point being,

3173
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:22,950
I'm standing there with these
fucking tin cans and my hands,

3174
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:28,250
like holding onto this thing and this guy
who is reading out of this book like a

3175
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,050
Prozac Zombie,

3176
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:31,411
I mean,

3177
01:19:31,411 --> 01:19:31,921
he's like,

3178
01:19:31,921 --> 01:19:32,280
he's,

3179
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:33,420
he's a weird,

3180
01:19:33,421 --> 01:19:36,000
disconnected dude and he's
reading me these things.

3181
01:19:36,001 --> 01:19:37,320
He definitely doesn't know who I am.

3182
01:19:37,630 --> 01:19:37,770
Uh,

3183
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:38,011
you know,

3184
01:19:38,011 --> 01:19:40,400
he's never watched fear factor
or anything before he's,

3185
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:41,550
he was 100%.

3186
01:19:41,551 --> 01:19:41,671
Like,

3187
01:19:41,671 --> 01:19:41,821
he,

3188
01:19:41,821 --> 01:19:41,991
uh,

3189
01:19:41,991 --> 01:19:43,650
asked me my name a couple of times.

3190
01:19:43,651 --> 01:19:44,251
He forgot it.

3191
01:19:44,251 --> 01:19:45,210
He had to ask me it again.

3192
01:19:45,690 --> 01:19:46,291
But the,

3193
01:19:46,291 --> 01:19:46,770
um,

3194
01:19:46,770 --> 01:19:48,180
the way he was like taking me through.

3195
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:49,680
Do you feel,

3196
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:50,310
uh,

3197
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:50,550
what,

3198
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:52,740
how do you feel when you
feel about your childhood?

3199
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:54,260
Hmm.

3200
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:54,810
I'm like,

3201
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:55,190
great.

3202
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:56,023
It's pretty good.

3203
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:56,720
Good childhood.

3204
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:57,051
I'm here.

3205
01:19:57,051 --> 01:19:57,884
I'm healthy.

3206
01:19:58,140 --> 01:19:58,973
Okay.

3207
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:01,610
How do you feel about your education?

3208
01:20:01,611 --> 01:20:05,330
Like if you're asking me these weird
questions when I'm holding onto the floor,

3209
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:06,241
I don't know.

3210
01:20:06,241 --> 01:20:07,090
I don't understand it.

3211
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:09,730
And they were trying to like show that
you have a certain amount of stress in

3212
01:20:09,731 --> 01:20:14,731
your life and what they would recommend
is that you look into dianetics and then

3213
01:20:15,521 --> 01:20:17,470
you look into dianetics and then boom,

3214
01:20:17,530 --> 01:20:18,010
you're,

3215
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:19,360
you're a scientologist.

3216
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:20,830
And what,

3217
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:21,341
you know,

3218
01:20:21,341 --> 01:20:25,780
Scientology can too for a lot of people
is provide them with a framework,

3219
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,370
provide them with like a scaffolding.

3220
01:20:27,371 --> 01:20:31,240
It gives him like a way to
like move forward and that,

3221
01:20:31,241 --> 01:20:32,800
that that's legit for everybody.

3222
01:20:32,801 --> 01:20:34,540
For what it's Christianity or anything.

3223
01:20:34,690 --> 01:20:36,040
When you give someone a framework,

3224
01:20:36,041 --> 01:20:37,000
sometimes it just looked,

3225
01:20:37,001 --> 01:20:40,600
all they need is a step by
step instruction of how to
get through life or how to

3226
01:20:40,601 --> 01:20:41,434
move through,

3227
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:41,710
you know,

3228
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:43,000
to the next stage how to,

3229
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:43,960
how to go get a job,

3230
01:20:43,961 --> 01:20:44,830
how to get their shit together.

3231
01:20:44,831 --> 01:20:47,000
Like people need like instructional,

3232
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:49,000
even even wack ones,

3233
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:49,781
you know,

3234
01:20:49,781 --> 01:20:50,410
he's in Wac,

3235
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:52,570
ones that have aliens
in them and like what?

3236
01:20:52,571 --> 01:20:53,291
All that other stuff,

3237
01:20:53,291 --> 01:20:56,390
the [inaudible] and the volcanoes
and what does the story do?

3238
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,510
Anything that we can play
a quick south park like,

3239
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:58,870
yeah,

3240
01:20:58,870 --> 01:20:59,530
let's do that.

3241
01:20:59,530 --> 01:21:00,011
Let's do that.

3242
01:21:00,011 --> 01:21:01,150
Because this is the why.

3243
01:21:01,151 --> 01:21:03,310
Why fuck around when the
masters already nailed it.

3244
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:03,671
Okay.

3245
01:21:03,671 --> 01:21:03,941
Hold on.

3246
01:21:03,941 --> 01:21:04,361
Let me get this,

3247
01:21:04,361 --> 01:21:05,194
get this.

3248
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:08,690
I can tell you what stresses you Joe.

3249
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:09,710
What the reason.

3250
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:10,693
Lack of integrity.

3251
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:11,500
Yeah.

3252
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,333
Anything.

3253
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,500
He's stealing material
people that bullshit.

3254
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:17,053
You know what I mean?

3255
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:17,420
Yeah.

3256
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:17,750
Let's,

3257
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:18,980
let's listen to this.

3258
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:20,003
Let's see if we can,

3259
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,190
there was a reason for people getting sab

3260
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:30,060
75 billion years ago.

3261
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:31,410
Back then,

3262
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:32,800
that was a galactic federation,

3263
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:37,640
which was ruled over by the Lord Walk,

3264
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:37,951
walk,

3265
01:21:37,951 --> 01:21:38,260
walk,

3266
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,093
walk.

3267
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:43,500
Galaxy was overpopulated and so he
rounded up the hop as aliens from all

3268
01:21:43,501 --> 01:21:45,390
different plans and the hospitals.

3269
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:52,301
The graphic it says,

3270
01:21:52,301 --> 01:21:54,090
this is what Scientology
was actually right,

3271
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:59,020
believe which looked like DC
Hayes except the croc cruisers.

3272
01:21:59,030 --> 01:22:04,030
They took the frozen alien bodies to
harm and dump them into the volcanoes of

3273
01:22:04,161 --> 01:22:04,994
Hawaii.

3274
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:07,820
The aliens were no longer have chosen

3275
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,700
the souls of those aliens.

3276
01:22:10,701 --> 01:22:13,970
However they've gone and all
bloated up towards the sky.

3277
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:19,960
But the evil Lord Zino had repaired for
this Paul Paul Walker shows to return.

3278
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:23,450
And so we built giant
full catchers in the sky,

3279
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:31,860
the rain watching to see what he wishes
he knew about all the phones were forced

3280
01:22:32,061 --> 01:22:33,860
to watch days of brainwashing material.

3281
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:36,680
What's trick them into
believing a false reality.

3282
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:37,380
Vito,

3283
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:38,470
good release behavior,

3284
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:40,190
which roamed the earth.

3285
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:43,670
English reading the fog of
confusion at the dawn of Man.

3286
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:46,580
The is finally found bodies
which you can grab onto.

3287
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:48,200
They attached themselves.

3288
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:52,070
All man con is still to this
day talking all our fears.

3289
01:22:56,540 --> 01:22:57,373
Yeah.

3290
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,540
That's where our fears,

3291
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:01,520
our confusions in our problems come from,

3292
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:05,250
from the Seatons were so fucking smart,

3293
01:23:05,251 --> 01:23:05,640
aren't they?

3294
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:05,791
Oh,

3295
01:23:05,791 --> 01:23:06,150
those guys

3296
01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:06,983
are the best.

3297
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:08,010
I love south firing.

3298
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:09,420
Have you ever met those guys?

3299
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:11,950
You Know Eric laughing?

3300
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:12,290
Have,

3301
01:23:12,290 --> 01:23:12,571
do they,

3302
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:15,600
have you ever been to the laugh factory
or do they come in there and what's the

3303
01:23:15,601 --> 01:23:16,050
guy's name?

3304
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:17,280
Trey Parker and Matt Stone.

3305
01:23:17,310 --> 01:23:18,270
Trey Parker.

3306
01:23:18,450 --> 01:23:19,950
I met somewhere along the line.

3307
01:23:20,070 --> 01:23:20,420
Oh that's cool.

3308
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:22,320
But I think he was
producing a long time ago,

3309
01:23:22,321 --> 01:23:23,540
maybe on Fox or something.

3310
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:24,374
They're writing.

3311
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:25,770
So you used to open up for share.

3312
01:23:25,771 --> 01:23:27,600
Did you ever mess around with shared?

3313
01:23:27,601 --> 01:23:28,880
Did you ever get a part of that,

3314
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,080
that everyone like mess around with share?

3315
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,250
You mean like sexually?

3316
01:23:32,251 --> 01:23:32,600
Yeah.

3317
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:33,433
Or Know

3318
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:34,900
No.

3319
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:35,900
Wear her outfit with the,

3320
01:23:35,901 --> 01:23:39,720
but I remember one night we were
working at the Mirage and I would,

3321
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:40,790
you know,

3322
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:42,290
and when we work in like casinos,

3323
01:23:42,291 --> 01:23:46,190
we would see each other like I don't
have an arena or there'd be a break after

3324
01:23:46,191 --> 01:23:46,460
it,

3325
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:46,850
you know,

3326
01:23:46,850 --> 01:23:49,730
so I would never see her cause she'd
be putting on one over wigs and her

3327
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:50,360
eyelashes,

3328
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:51,193
Shit.

3329
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:52,190
And she goes to me,

3330
01:23:52,191 --> 01:23:53,024
uh,

3331
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:54,501
as we're walking,

3332
01:23:54,501 --> 01:23:55,460
we're walking by and she goes,

3333
01:23:55,461 --> 01:23:58,220
I can't believe you did
a just over a hedge joke,

3334
01:23:58,250 --> 01:23:59,330
my grandmothers here.

3335
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:00,981
I said,

3336
01:24:00,981 --> 01:24:03,710
I can't believe that your
grandfather gets to see your ass.

3337
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,270
Later on that night were downstairs

3338
01:24:08,450 --> 01:24:11,990
party in her room and her
grandmother says like,

3339
01:24:11,991 --> 01:24:13,210
almost like it was a sitcom.

3340
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:13,581
She goes,

3341
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:15,590
I love that bit you did about the hedge.

3342
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:16,813
All right.

3343
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:18,663
She goes,

3344
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:19,670
you know what the fuck?

3345
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:21,413
She was cool.

3346
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:22,131
Very cool.

3347
01:24:22,131 --> 01:24:22,371
You know,

3348
01:24:22,371 --> 01:24:23,900
it's so weird how people are,

3349
01:24:23,901 --> 01:24:25,550
like friend of mine is working with her,

3350
01:24:25,551 --> 01:24:28,730
they're doing a gig in
Russia soon and she,

3351
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:29,020
you know,

3352
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:31,310
I mean she's very fucking talented,

3353
01:24:31,311 --> 01:24:31,521
you know,

3354
01:24:31,521 --> 01:24:35,360
obviously she accomplished whether you
like her or not and she's insecure about

3355
01:24:35,361 --> 01:24:36,194
her voice,

3356
01:24:36,430 --> 01:24:37,040
you know,

3357
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:37,301
and I'm,

3358
01:24:37,301 --> 01:24:37,560
I'm,

3359
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:38,151
I'm fuck,

3360
01:24:38,151 --> 01:24:39,020
I suck,

3361
01:24:39,050 --> 01:24:40,130
but I love to sing.

3362
01:24:40,430 --> 01:24:42,060
I'm singing with him
or all my fucking arm.

3363
01:24:42,061 --> 01:24:42,860
Then it's secure.

3364
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:43,090
I don't,

3365
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:44,210
but of course she's famous,

3366
01:24:44,211 --> 01:24:44,460
you know,

3367
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:45,111
as a singer.

3368
01:24:45,111 --> 01:24:48,890
But it's just so weird how people can be
insecure and we know this from any part

3369
01:24:48,891 --> 01:24:49,724
of show business,

3370
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:50,420
you know,

3371
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:52,220
the needy comedian would you think?

3372
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:53,143
Yeah.

3373
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:57,230
It's the worst and unfortunately this
is a lot of us that I really liked it or

3374
01:24:57,231 --> 01:24:59,390
like that they want to come
up and see is this good?

3375
01:24:59,391 --> 01:25:00,091
Is this okay?

3376
01:25:00,091 --> 01:25:00,301
Yeah.

3377
01:25:00,301 --> 01:25:00,500
Yeah.

3378
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:00,681
Like,

3379
01:25:00,681 --> 01:25:01,580
come on man.

3380
01:25:01,610 --> 01:25:02,630
Get out of here with that shit.

3381
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:04,880
Go up there dude.

3382
01:25:05,090 --> 01:25:07,070
It's funny because the way we do stand up,

3383
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:08,210
all of us together,

3384
01:25:08,211 --> 01:25:10,580
it's kind of the same way
when we all get together.

3385
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:11,541
We have these shows,

3386
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:14,720
whether it's a are your
Dunkin or or Joey or whatever.

3387
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:17,930
We're just hanging out and then
one of us will go on stage,

3388
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:18,311
meaning we,

3389
01:25:18,311 --> 01:25:19,250
you've done these shows with us.

3390
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,720
Of course another one would go onstage,

3391
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:24,810
but every now and then we'll bring
someone new into the mix and then they're

3392
01:25:24,830 --> 01:25:25,371
like I said,

3393
01:25:25,371 --> 01:25:26,630
he could match it up with this,

3394
01:25:26,631 --> 01:25:27,464
which I did.

3395
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:28,340
What are you doing?

3396
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:29,393
Go Up.

3397
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:30,681
Go up there.

3398
01:25:30,681 --> 01:25:31,341
Come on man.

3399
01:25:31,341 --> 01:25:32,770
Joey was both of them.

3400
01:25:32,810 --> 01:25:34,370
Both of them were on
that show list and I did.

3401
01:25:34,371 --> 01:25:35,690
They left I think before you came in.

3402
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:36,903
I just,

3403
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:38,300
I met Ari upstairs.

3404
01:25:38,370 --> 01:25:38,920
They were both,

3405
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,340
they're both fucking really funny,

3406
01:25:40,341 --> 01:25:42,560
but Joey was fucking high as it could.

3407
01:25:42,561 --> 01:25:42,810
I can't.

3408
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:44,470
His eyes were like clothes.

3409
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:47,870
There's I'm so fucking
item and they almost fell.

3410
01:25:48,410 --> 01:25:48,891
I tell you,

3411
01:25:48,891 --> 01:25:50,300
it must fell off to big boy.

3412
01:25:50,330 --> 01:25:50,811
Big Boy.

3413
01:25:50,811 --> 01:25:51,381
That's not good.

3414
01:25:51,381 --> 01:25:52,790
If he falls off that stage,

3415
01:25:52,791 --> 01:25:55,730
that's not a fall backwards near the way.

3416
01:25:55,731 --> 01:25:56,564
He's good,

3417
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:58,790
but he would have killed
the shingles up front.

3418
01:25:59,180 --> 01:25:59,421
He can.

3419
01:25:59,421 --> 01:26:00,350
You can break things.

3420
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:01,213
I wish I was.

3421
01:26:01,970 --> 01:26:02,870
I was watching those

3422
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:07,210
when you were doing some of those bits
and said they couldn't fucking help but

3423
01:26:07,211 --> 01:26:08,044
laugh,

3424
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,760
you know when you did
the the the last bit,

3425
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:11,613
but you know.

3426
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:12,081
Yeah,

3427
01:26:12,081 --> 01:26:12,351
yeah,

3428
01:26:12,351 --> 01:26:12,790
yeah.

3429
01:26:12,790 --> 01:26:13,100
They,

3430
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:14,160
I loved watching him.

3431
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:17,570
I love watching people who can't help
laugh even though they think I've seen

3432
01:26:17,571 --> 01:26:19,100
people shake their head and laugh.

3433
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:19,410
I go,

3434
01:26:19,410 --> 01:26:19,520
no,

3435
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:24,020
you can't disapprove and left 11 when
you're out with coworkers and because you

3436
01:26:24,021 --> 01:26:26,780
don't want those other ladies
in your office to how you know,

3437
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:29,630
like you're all on the
corporate ladder together.

3438
01:26:29,631 --> 01:26:31,850
You don't want them to have a turn it on.

3439
01:26:31,851 --> 01:26:32,091
Yeah.

3440
01:26:32,091 --> 01:26:32,361
Yeah.

3441
01:26:32,361 --> 01:26:35,210
We went there and you see this
one every fucking blow job jokes.

3442
01:26:35,211 --> 01:26:36,350
She's laughing her ass off.

3443
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:40,730
But before you came in I asked him
something that you really shouldn't ask

3444
01:26:40,731 --> 01:26:41,130
women.

3445
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:41,963
We shouldn't ask him.

3446
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:42,710
I said,

3447
01:26:42,710 --> 01:26:43,610
which one are you?

3448
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:48,800
Which one of you ladies do you think is
the hottest and also the at least hot.

3449
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:51,950
And then one of them was their
boss and go leave her out of it.

3450
01:26:51,951 --> 01:26:53,210
Then she's the boss.

3451
01:26:53,211 --> 01:26:53,870
But just like,

3452
01:26:53,870 --> 01:26:54,141
I mean,

3453
01:26:54,141 --> 01:26:56,570
obviously one of you is in a
different league than the others.

3454
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:56,811
I mean,

3455
01:26:56,811 --> 01:26:57,061
I could,

3456
01:26:57,061 --> 01:27:00,500
I could see and they were like fucking
laughing and at least one of them is

3457
01:27:00,501 --> 01:27:00,680
thinking,

3458
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:01,640
I wonder if it's me,

3459
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:02,660
you know?

3460
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:03,021
Wow.

3461
01:27:03,021 --> 01:27:03,854
That's funny.

3462
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,050
Yeah.

3463
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:07,380
I think they liked you tomorrow.

3464
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:08,780
I love fucking with people.

3465
01:27:08,781 --> 01:27:10,550
I love interacting.

3466
01:27:10,650 --> 01:27:11,483
Yeah,

3467
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:12,180
we're,

3468
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:12,940
we're doing a show,

3469
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:13,320
Joan,

3470
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:14,360
if you ever want to come in,

3471
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:17,210
I don't want to be a
fucking a plugged machine,

3472
01:27:17,211 --> 01:27:19,570
but it's going to be called
busting balls with dom.

3473
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:20,620
Rarer and,

3474
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:24,290
and we encourage interaction
with the crowd and how they say,

3475
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:25,460
no talking during the show.

3476
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:26,810
I want you to fucking talk.

3477
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:29,030
I want you to break balls then we have,

3478
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:29,420
yeah.

3479
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:29,980
And then we'll,

3480
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:30,641
we'll have a,

3481
01:27:30,641 --> 01:27:31,100
uh,

3482
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:33,980
also an interview and we can bust each
other's balls where we can be fucking

3483
01:27:33,981 --> 01:27:34,371
goofy,

3484
01:27:34,371 --> 01:27:34,870
you know,

3485
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:38,360
so it's essentially not heckling
because you're actually encouraging the

3486
01:27:38,361 --> 01:27:39,020
interaction.

3487
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:39,741
It's not heckling,

3488
01:27:39,741 --> 01:27:39,881
you know,

3489
01:27:39,881 --> 01:27:41,180
it's not like a regular comedy show.

3490
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:42,053
No,

3491
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:42,640
that's second.

3492
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,990
It's going to confuse the shit out
of your regular comedy club people.

3493
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:46,520
But I'll say it at the beginning,

3494
01:27:46,521 --> 01:27:47,030
you know,

3495
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:47,950
but then they're gonna want,

3496
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:49,850
they're gonna want that
kind of Damo rarer action.

3497
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:50,560
I'm gonna.

3498
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:51,393
I don't want that,

3499
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:51,950
that,

3500
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:53,180
that spontaneous shit.

3501
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:54,073
I don't mind.

3502
01:27:54,450 --> 01:27:55,283
You don't mind.

3503
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:56,180
You know,

3504
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:58,460
I don't like when it bits get interrupted.

3505
01:27:58,640 --> 01:27:59,960
I don't mind talking to people.

3506
01:28:00,990 --> 01:28:02,600
I love talking to you
don't get interrupted.

3507
01:28:02,601 --> 01:28:03,101
People have to,

3508
01:28:03,101 --> 01:28:03,980
you give sometimes.

3509
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:05,090
Sometimes you do.

3510
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:07,250
You know this drunk man drops for a while.

3511
01:28:07,251 --> 01:28:08,870
That's part of our business and they,

3512
01:28:08,871 --> 01:28:12,020
and they also want to like
have an interaction with you.

3513
01:28:12,210 --> 01:28:13,880
You ever have people call out your bits?

3514
01:28:13,910 --> 01:28:15,640
Like you're not doing enough that,

3515
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:16,581
yeah,

3516
01:28:16,581 --> 01:28:17,570
they'll say do that,

3517
01:28:17,571 --> 01:28:18,470
but you know,

3518
01:28:18,530 --> 01:28:20,150
can't fuck.

3519
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:22,610
It's really hard to do
a bit when someone asks,

3520
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:24,650
you can do it cause
it's so and spontaneous.

3521
01:28:24,651 --> 01:28:27,290
It's also really hard to do a bit when
you know that they already know it.

3522
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:28,190
Yeah.

3523
01:28:28,190 --> 01:28:28,580
It's like,

3524
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:28,941
you know,

3525
01:28:28,941 --> 01:28:30,590
it's not not the same as a song.

3526
01:28:31,310 --> 01:28:33,050
It's weird because it was for dice.

3527
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:34,580
Right.

3528
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:36,200
You know when dice was at his peak.

3529
01:28:36,201 --> 01:28:39,320
That's one of the things is everybody
would like say the joke with them.

3530
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:40,990
What's in the bowl.

3531
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:43,490
You can also his audiences.

3532
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:48,260
God lives in fear was that I am a part of,

3533
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:49,670
I was probably in the audience.

3534
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:51,980
I want to see dice in Vegas.

3535
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:52,873
I had a good old time.

3536
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:54,400
He tried to bad mouth me on the show.

3537
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:55,011
No,

3538
01:28:55,011 --> 01:28:56,620
he didn't pay it and you
were covering for me,

3539
01:28:56,630 --> 01:28:57,463
you and Eleanor.

3540
01:28:57,690 --> 01:28:58,160
I hear.

3541
01:28:58,160 --> 01:28:59,120
I hear things.

3542
01:28:59,210 --> 01:28:59,571
Listen,

3543
01:28:59,571 --> 01:29:00,770
you guys kind of hug it out.

3544
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:02,050
Hug it out as

3545
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:03,280
too old school gangsters.

3546
01:29:04,930 --> 01:29:05,350
Dice,

3547
01:29:05,350 --> 01:29:06,640
dice friends at one time.

3548
01:29:06,670 --> 01:29:06,851
Yeah,

3549
01:29:06,851 --> 01:29:07,630
I know you were.

3550
01:29:07,630 --> 01:29:08,320
Yeah.

3551
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:09,153
Yeah.

3552
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:09,993
He's a good guy.

3553
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:11,593
I like him.

3554
01:29:11,610 --> 01:29:12,460
He's not a good guy.

3555
01:29:12,490 --> 01:29:13,323
Good guy to me.

3556
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:14,583
He's a good guy to you.

3557
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:15,463
He's not a good guy.

3558
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:16,450
I'm a good guy.

3559
01:29:16,450 --> 01:29:17,470
You're a great guy.

3560
01:29:17,471 --> 01:29:17,930
I'm good.

3561
01:29:17,930 --> 01:29:18,763
You're a great,

3562
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,620
if I had to choose between the two of you,

3563
01:29:21,370 --> 01:29:22,203
take you.

3564
01:29:22,270 --> 01:29:23,103
Me Too.

3565
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:25,240
You guys are all getting
in trouble now you guys.

3566
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:28,511
I do.

3567
01:29:28,511 --> 01:29:30,390
I just wished the deicing died.

3568
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:31,060
Let's dom,

3569
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:31,361
dom.

3570
01:29:31,361 --> 01:29:32,500
I to be my friend,

3571
01:29:32,501 --> 01:29:35,410
my good friend since
like 1990 I love dice.

3572
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,180
I'm a fuge fan of his.

3573
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,580
I grew up being inspired by like dice,

3574
01:29:39,970 --> 01:29:40,900
but I liked him better.

3575
01:29:42,970 --> 01:29:43,750
I'm not just saying that,

3576
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:44,583
but it just gets done.

3577
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:46,240
Dom is my very good friend.

3578
01:29:46,241 --> 01:29:46,301
We,

3579
01:29:46,301 --> 01:29:46,701
we'd diamond,

3580
01:29:46,701 --> 01:29:47,590
I play pool every week.

3581
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:51,340
I can't go without dom said the
sex have sex with dom or Andy.

3582
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:52,660
Andy Roddick.

3583
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:53,830
Andrew dice clay.

3584
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:54,400
Yeah.

3585
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:54,731
Oh,

3586
01:29:54,731 --> 01:29:56,230
I would dice as much harder than me.

3587
01:29:56,530 --> 01:29:57,620
Beautiful guys.

3588
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:58,470
Softer and club.

3589
01:29:58,470 --> 01:29:59,111
More of a challenge.

3590
01:29:59,111 --> 01:29:59,944
The whole dice down.

3591
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:01,233
Yeah.

3592
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:02,900
I think it'd be cleaner.

3593
01:30:02,950 --> 01:30:05,530
That's what you could shoot as well.

3594
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:05,951
For me.

3595
01:30:05,951 --> 01:30:07,180
It's gotta be some support in it.

3596
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:08,860
I want to be fucking that dude.

3597
01:30:08,861 --> 01:30:10,120
It's got to be a bit of a struggle.

3598
01:30:10,121 --> 01:30:12,170
I think I couldn't do it.

3599
01:30:12,171 --> 01:30:14,650
I couldn't get a hard
on seeing the hairy ass.

3600
01:30:14,770 --> 01:30:15,521
You say that,

3601
01:30:15,521 --> 01:30:17,020
but what if that became your thing?

3602
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:17,370
Well,

3603
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:18,460
how's it going to become my thing?

3604
01:30:18,461 --> 01:30:18,591
You know,

3605
01:30:18,591 --> 01:30:21,490
if there's one skyrocket orgasm,

3606
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:26,700
because apparently a big dude like that
can really clench down on his ass cheeks

3607
01:30:27,111 --> 01:30:28,450
and anybody getting hungry.

3608
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:30,790
And when you score it,

3609
01:30:30,791 --> 01:30:34,720
you squirt like you've never scored it
before and then you just make a decision.

3610
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:35,100
Okay,

3611
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:36,270
you should write poetry month.

3612
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:38,890
You've got away with words,

3613
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:43,690
Labelle fuck game.

3614
01:30:47,490 --> 01:30:47,801
You know,

3615
01:30:47,801 --> 01:30:48,131
I've tried,

3616
01:30:48,131 --> 01:30:49,970
I tried to get over to Karma bit.

3617
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:55,440
It's tough for me with the Italian
thing what him and I just hold grudges,

3618
01:30:55,511 --> 01:30:55,780
you know?

3619
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:56,170
Yeah.

3620
01:30:56,170 --> 01:30:56,530
Yeah.

3621
01:30:56,530 --> 01:30:57,363
But I only have three.

3622
01:30:57,390 --> 01:30:58,810
There's only three comedians I hate.

3623
01:30:58,960 --> 01:30:59,793
Who are the other two?

3624
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:00,550
Uh,

3625
01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:02,020
Craig Shoemaker and Bobby Collins.

3626
01:31:02,050 --> 01:31:02,271
Wow.

3627
01:31:02,271 --> 01:31:03,400
I can't believe you got that out of me.

3628
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:07,541
I don't know.

3629
01:31:07,541 --> 01:31:08,200
Shoemaker.

3630
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,400
I've only met him once.

3631
01:31:09,401 --> 01:31:10,234
Fucking asshole.

3632
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:11,530
What's wrong with shoemaker?

3633
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:13,733
Uh,

3634
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:17,730
he's just a bragging cunt and
I said it with all due respect,

3635
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:18,573
Joe.

3636
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:20,320
He's just a,

3637
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:20,491
you know.

3638
01:31:20,491 --> 01:31:20,821
All right.

3639
01:31:20,821 --> 01:31:21,571
I'll give you an example.

3640
01:31:21,571 --> 01:31:22,110
Okay.

3641
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:23,400
I'm trying to clean up my Karma,

3642
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:24,080
right?

3643
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,290
A couple of years ago they said,

3644
01:31:25,291 --> 01:31:26,120
do you mind if,

3645
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:26,440
um,

3646
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:26,910
you know,

3647
01:31:26,910 --> 01:31:29,040
I draw well in Atlantic city,

3648
01:31:29,370 --> 01:31:30,870
so I'm going to do the regatta.

3649
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:33,030
And they said he might've
shoemaker up was for you.

3650
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:35,730
Now he was getting $7,500 to open.

3651
01:31:35,731 --> 01:31:35,881
So,

3652
01:31:35,881 --> 01:31:36,420
you know,

3653
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:37,290
I was getting good money,

3654
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:38,040
right?

3655
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:38,581
So I said,

3656
01:31:38,581 --> 01:31:39,001
you know what?

3657
01:31:39,001 --> 01:31:39,480
Fuck it.

3658
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:40,650
Go clean up the Karma.

3659
01:31:40,651 --> 01:31:41,350
Let them open.

3660
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:41,730
Right?

3661
01:31:41,730 --> 01:31:45,780
That's 45 minutes
instead of 25 to fuck me.

3662
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:46,950
And you know what he said at the end,

3663
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:48,533
he goes,

3664
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:49,930
I'll never work with you again.

3665
01:31:49,931 --> 01:31:50,430
And I said,

3666
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:50,911
why is that?

3667
01:31:50,911 --> 01:31:51,391
And I'm thinking,

3668
01:31:51,391 --> 01:31:52,790
you don't got a chance
to work with me again.

3669
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:53,101
He goes,

3670
01:31:53,101 --> 01:31:55,020
because I can't believe
you could follow me.

3671
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:56,070
What a fucking ego.

3672
01:31:56,430 --> 01:31:56,861
What a jerk.

3673
01:31:56,861 --> 01:31:57,694
He was upset.

3674
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:59,460
He was upset because I him,

3675
01:31:59,461 --> 01:32:00,390
he thought he buried me.

3676
01:32:00,450 --> 01:32:01,560
So was it like a Jew?

3677
01:32:01,650 --> 01:32:04,350
Was he like sort of jokingly,

3678
01:32:04,410 --> 01:32:05,243
uh,

3679
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:06,810
jokingly praising,

3680
01:32:06,811 --> 01:32:07,591
you know,

3681
01:32:07,591 --> 01:32:08,940
he's just such a deck.

3682
01:32:08,970 --> 01:32:10,200
He wasn't joking at all.

3683
01:32:10,290 --> 01:32:13,260
He just really thought nobody could follow
him cause he got a standing ovation.

3684
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:14,101
So I walked out,

3685
01:32:14,101 --> 01:32:15,450
I got like a fucking guy up for me.

3686
01:32:15,451 --> 01:32:16,740
It got a standing ovation
when I'm not going,

3687
01:32:16,741 --> 01:32:18,270
what am I supposed to fly around the room?

3688
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:19,160
You know,

3689
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:19,531
I mean,

3690
01:32:19,531 --> 01:32:19,950
and then,

3691
01:32:19,950 --> 01:32:21,240
but they were there to see me.

3692
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:22,110
So,

3693
01:32:22,110 --> 01:32:22,740
you know,

3694
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:22,981
it was,

3695
01:32:22,981 --> 01:32:23,814
it was not hard.

3696
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:26,900
Really hard to bury someone when
people are there to see you.

3697
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:28,120
I know he was just,

3698
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:29,580
and I didn't even get laid into him.

3699
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:31,800
Like what an ancillary was
telling him about the time.

3700
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:32,400
Well,

3701
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:32,900
I mean,

3702
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:35,430
imagine just doing 20 minutes over
when you're opening for somebody.

3703
01:32:35,450 --> 01:32:36,930
Just money and fucking run.

3704
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:37,171
Yeah.

3705
01:32:37,171 --> 01:32:38,750
Why did he do that to Jack Him?

3706
01:32:39,210 --> 01:32:39,541
No,

3707
01:32:39,541 --> 01:32:41,460
because I just didn't want
to communicate with him.

3708
01:32:41,461 --> 01:32:44,100
I didn't want to fucking have a talk out
with them and because I don't want to

3709
01:32:44,101 --> 01:32:44,880
be friends with them.

3710
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:45,713
Right.

3711
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:46,740
So that was it.

3712
01:32:46,740 --> 01:32:50,880
You were trying to clean up your Karma
and I blow it and then I blow Bobby

3713
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,020
Collins at fucking Dick face.

3714
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:53,653
Do you know him?

3715
01:32:54,150 --> 01:32:55,010
You know him,

3716
01:32:55,410 --> 01:32:56,860
Bobby Collins Shit.

3717
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:58,030
I don't know him very well.

3718
01:32:58,031 --> 01:32:59,640
I know you never show.

3719
01:32:59,641 --> 01:33:00,281
He's the exact,

3720
01:33:00,281 --> 01:33:00,690
yeah,

3721
01:33:00,690 --> 01:33:01,151
I said to you,

3722
01:33:01,151 --> 01:33:02,860
he doesn't have a fucking honest bone.

3723
01:33:02,861 --> 01:33:03,431
His body,

3724
01:33:03,431 --> 01:33:04,570
so fucking phony.

3725
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:05,780
He's the kind of guy,

3726
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:06,280
he'll go,

3727
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:09,010
this guy Frankie who used to
work at the comedy connection.

3728
01:33:09,010 --> 01:33:09,940
Frankie Baby,

3729
01:33:09,941 --> 01:33:10,990
look at you lost weight.

3730
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:11,471
Frankie goes,

3731
01:33:11,471 --> 01:33:11,771
damn,

3732
01:33:11,771 --> 01:33:13,420
I look like I'm going to fucking explode.

3733
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:14,670
I gained the a hundred pants.

3734
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:15,910
I saw this phony fuck.

3735
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:17,440
But that's the kind of guy he was.

3736
01:33:17,770 --> 01:33:19,750
So he demanded to,

3737
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:20,370
uh,

3738
01:33:20,370 --> 01:33:25,090
we were working together at Staten Island
and I don't give a fuck about going on

3739
01:33:25,091 --> 01:33:25,480
first.

3740
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:26,171
I don't give a fuck.

3741
01:33:26,171 --> 01:33:27,040
I just want to get the money,

3742
01:33:27,041 --> 01:33:27,761
have a good time,

3743
01:33:27,761 --> 01:33:28,594
get out of there.

3744
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:31,720
And I was supposed to headline this
show and it said it in the contract.

3745
01:33:32,230 --> 01:33:35,410
So the Bobby Collins was
throwing a fit about,

3746
01:33:36,430 --> 01:33:39,040
he's throwing a fit about who was
going to close the show to watch it.

3747
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:40,280
Pixie from Paul.

3748
01:33:40,330 --> 01:33:41,840
I'm looking at phony fucking smiling.

3749
01:33:42,050 --> 01:33:42,840
Hi Guys.

3750
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:43,880
I'm a white boon.

3751
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:45,410
So anyway,

3752
01:33:45,411 --> 01:33:45,681
he,

3753
01:33:45,681 --> 01:33:46,280
uh,

3754
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:47,113
he calls up,

3755
01:33:47,150 --> 01:33:47,961
he wants to close,

3756
01:33:47,961 --> 01:33:49,820
cause he went to sell
merchandise after the show.

3757
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:52,430
So the producer calls me,

3758
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:53,600
they say quo Donald,

3759
01:33:53,601 --> 01:33:54,141
he's a good guy.

3760
01:33:54,141 --> 01:33:54,470
Oh fucking,

3761
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:55,280
I don't care.

3762
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:56,780
So she calls me and she goes,

3763
01:33:56,781 --> 01:33:56,991
you know,

3764
01:33:56,991 --> 01:33:58,070
do you mind if he closes?

3765
01:33:58,071 --> 01:33:58,281
I go,

3766
01:33:58,281 --> 01:33:58,461
look,

3767
01:33:58,461 --> 01:33:59,270
I'm a headliner.

3768
01:33:59,270 --> 01:34:00,440
I headline that.

3769
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:02,000
You see what it says in the contract?

3770
01:34:02,001 --> 01:34:02,241
She goes,

3771
01:34:02,241 --> 01:34:02,331
oh,

3772
01:34:02,331 --> 01:34:02,810
I understand.

3773
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:03,161
You're right.

3774
01:34:03,161 --> 01:34:03,350
I go,

3775
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:04,071
I don't give a fuck.

3776
01:34:04,071 --> 01:34:04,904
I'm kidding you.

3777
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:05,211
I said,

3778
01:34:05,211 --> 01:34:07,670
I'll do a meet and greet at the
beginning and then get out of there.

3779
01:34:07,671 --> 01:34:09,170
I don't care if they're going to pay me,

3780
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:10,160
I'll do my best.

3781
01:34:10,940 --> 01:34:11,361
Anyway,

3782
01:34:11,361 --> 01:34:12,530
after that month later,

3783
01:34:12,531 --> 01:34:13,340
Mike Ivy,

3784
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:13,940
my friend,

3785
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:15,200
my black friend from Mississippi,

3786
01:34:15,230 --> 01:34:15,621
Tove Lo,

3787
01:34:15,621 --> 01:34:16,391
you know Nikki,

3788
01:34:16,391 --> 01:34:17,300
I love you brother.

3789
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:18,291
And he goes,

3790
01:34:18,291 --> 01:34:18,850
uh,

3791
01:34:18,850 --> 01:34:19,330
Nikki,

3792
01:34:19,330 --> 01:34:23,360
all God asks you a question where you
opened them for Bobby Collins and Staten

3793
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:23,430
Island.

3794
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:23,900
I'm like,

3795
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:24,733
what do you think?

3796
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:25,880
Right?

3797
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:26,541
So he goes,

3798
01:34:26,541 --> 01:34:26,931
no.

3799
01:34:26,931 --> 01:34:27,411
I said,

3800
01:34:27,411 --> 01:34:27,561
well,

3801
01:34:27,561 --> 01:34:29,600
it's not even worth
talking about is anyway.

3802
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,030
I see Bobby at the common struggle.

3803
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:31,873
Bobby,

3804
01:34:32,450 --> 01:34:33,860
you're fucking pathetic.

3805
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:36,410
Dommy baby.

3806
01:34:36,411 --> 01:34:36,801
I see you.

3807
01:34:36,801 --> 01:34:37,640
Just pathetic.

3808
01:34:37,850 --> 01:34:39,110
And then I walked away and I was it.

3809
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:39,930
So that,

3810
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:41,480
that's so much for cleaning up my Karma.

3811
01:34:41,690 --> 01:34:42,471
This isn't on the air,

3812
01:34:42,471 --> 01:34:42,950
is it?

3813
01:34:42,950 --> 01:34:43,790
I don't think so.

3814
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:44,653
Okay.

3815
01:34:44,690 --> 01:34:48,380
The cons are closed a
spring 2007 CFA season,

3816
01:34:48,410 --> 01:34:50,300
the laughter arts festival.

3817
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:51,501
What does that,

3818
01:34:51,501 --> 01:34:52,370
what does the CFA

3819
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:54,890
college of Staten Island,

3820
01:34:54,891 --> 01:34:55,724
that's where you guys were.

3821
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:56,421
Oh,

3822
01:34:56,421 --> 01:34:56,980
that's funny.

3823
01:34:56,980 --> 01:34:57,681
It's great.

3824
01:34:57,681 --> 01:34:58,500
You can look at Schiller.

3825
01:34:58,500 --> 01:34:58,790
Yeah,

3826
01:34:58,790 --> 01:34:59,623
yeah.

3827
01:35:00,110 --> 01:35:02,780
Well I'm sorry you had those bad
experiences with those two guys.

3828
01:35:02,781 --> 01:35:05,480
But I mean I bet your ironed it out
by just out in them on the road.

3829
01:35:06,810 --> 01:35:09,800
You never had the guys just come up to
you like for some things you've said on

3830
01:35:09,801 --> 01:35:10,634
podcasts yet,

3831
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:11,500
cause you,

3832
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,520
you've been very outspoken with like,

3833
01:35:13,521 --> 01:35:14,340
you know,

3834
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:15,500
I'm on the edge,

3835
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:18,643
you know,

3836
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:20,360
but I love most people,

3837
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:21,800
very honest guy.

3838
01:35:21,830 --> 01:35:22,730
If you tell me,

3839
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:25,060
you know that someone's been a con to you,

3840
01:35:25,930 --> 01:35:26,780
I always believe you.

3841
01:35:26,870 --> 01:35:27,290
Yeah.

3842
01:35:27,290 --> 01:35:28,100
I mean I would never,

3843
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:31,820
I tried to like patch things
up and then I was wrong.

3844
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:32,683
I was right.

3845
01:35:33,050 --> 01:35:34,010
I wish I was wrong,

3846
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:34,791
you know what I mean?

3847
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:35,361
I wished that I,

3848
01:35:35,361 --> 01:35:36,460
it was worked and,

3849
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:38,490
but it didn't work out at me.

3850
01:35:38,491 --> 01:35:40,670
You know how many guys and these guys,

3851
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:40,920
Oh,

3852
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:43,520
do we do the thing about
Louis C k the shitty?

3853
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:44,840
No,

3854
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:45,673
you started it.

3855
01:35:47,370 --> 01:35:48,920
I was just talking about people I love,

3856
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:49,853
I don't know what happened.

3857
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:50,960
You know,

3858
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,880
you and Louie and,

3859
01:35:52,910 --> 01:35:53,210
uh,

3860
01:35:53,210 --> 01:35:54,043
Bill Berg,

3861
01:35:54,050 --> 01:35:55,820
best best comics in the world.

3862
01:35:55,821 --> 01:36:00,230
Fucking that Taj and Louis used
to come into Montreal and uh,

3863
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:00,561
okay,

3864
01:36:00,561 --> 01:36:04,310
so he'd be in the audience and the
character was [inaudible] ship balls.

3865
01:36:04,330 --> 01:36:05,163
That's the grossest,

3866
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:06,890
and so I'd be hosting the show.

3867
01:36:06,891 --> 01:36:07,370
I go,

3868
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:08,001
excuse me,

3869
01:36:08,001 --> 01:36:09,680
I think we've got a
celebrity in the audience.

3870
01:36:09,710 --> 01:36:11,640
And he put his hand over his head and go,

3871
01:36:11,641 --> 01:36:12,290
no,

3872
01:36:12,290 --> 01:36:12,830
I go,

3873
01:36:12,830 --> 01:36:14,060
is that you conti?

3874
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:15,081
Is that you?

3875
01:36:15,081 --> 01:36:15,660
And he goes,

3876
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:16,440
I said,

3877
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:17,160
Connie Mcshane,

3878
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:18,030
pause everybody.

3879
01:36:18,330 --> 01:36:18,901
Right everybody.

3880
01:36:18,901 --> 01:36:19,770
Yay.

3881
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:23,210
Cause we had plants all over
the room and then he kinda,

3882
01:36:23,530 --> 01:36:27,840
he happens to have a guitar by a seat.

3883
01:36:28,110 --> 01:36:28,370
I go,

3884
01:36:28,370 --> 01:36:28,691
Connie,

3885
01:36:28,691 --> 01:36:29,521
how about a song?

3886
01:36:29,521 --> 01:36:29,761
No,

3887
01:36:29,761 --> 01:36:30,630
I can't play it.

3888
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:35,130
Con t con t the whole crowds go and then
he comes up and does his fucking salt.

3889
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:35,531
Oh,

3890
01:36:35,531 --> 01:36:36,610
he used to cry laughing.

3891
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:37,800
That's Alaria.

3892
01:36:38,170 --> 01:36:39,960
I never seen Louie happier.

3893
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:42,870
He loved doing the
character Cunty Mc Shit.

3894
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:45,810
I Dunno if we had a middle name.

3895
01:36:45,910 --> 01:36:46,570
You know,

3896
01:36:46,570 --> 01:36:46,830
I,

3897
01:36:46,830 --> 01:36:47,621
I've said this before,

3898
01:36:47,621 --> 01:36:48,340
I'm gonna say it again,

3899
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:51,370
but Stan Hope said this and
I never agreed with him more.

3900
01:36:51,550 --> 01:36:51,911
He goes,

3901
01:36:51,911 --> 01:36:52,930
I could quit doing comedy,

3902
01:36:52,931 --> 01:36:53,590
but I couldn't,

3903
01:36:53,590 --> 01:36:55,150
couldn't quit hanging out with standups.

3904
01:36:55,330 --> 01:36:56,020
Yeah.

3905
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:58,360
So just to have that kind of experience,

3906
01:36:58,390 --> 01:36:59,380
be able to tell that story.

3907
01:36:59,470 --> 01:37:00,303
Oh yeah.

3908
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:01,180
It's fucking fun.

3909
01:37:01,390 --> 01:37:02,710
That's actually your job.

3910
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:03,830
That's what you do for work.

3911
01:37:03,831 --> 01:37:04,031
I do.

3912
01:37:04,031 --> 01:37:04,511
For a living.

3913
01:37:04,511 --> 01:37:04,960
Yeah.

3914
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,270
I mean what we did last night,

3915
01:37:06,271 --> 01:37:06,520
that's,

3916
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:07,420
that was our job.

3917
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:08,130
We,

3918
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:10,180
dom and I worked together last
night at the laugh factory.

3919
01:37:10,230 --> 01:37:10,510
Right.

3920
01:37:10,510 --> 01:37:12,040
We worked work and we're hanging out.

3921
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:13,540
Just laughing.

3922
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:17,110
And I remember so hosted some
shows thinking this is what I do.

3923
01:37:17,510 --> 01:37:18,010
I was,

3924
01:37:18,010 --> 01:37:21,370
there's one of you ever hear about the
guy who sticks to Roman candle up his ass

3925
01:37:22,140 --> 01:37:22,560
and,

3926
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:26,080
and they light it and then it
flares and they play any works.

3927
01:37:26,620 --> 01:37:27,670
It's random too.

3928
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:29,290
There's no business like show business.

3929
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:30,520
Really?

3930
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:31,353
Yeah.

3931
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:32,440
Can you look him up?

3932
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:35,950
You got to see this as one of
the funniest fucking thing.

3933
01:37:35,951 --> 01:37:38,170
Lights of Roman [inaudible]
sticks it in his hair.

3934
01:37:38,230 --> 01:37:39,580
Oh my God.

3935
01:37:41,050 --> 01:37:43,840
He pulls large pieces of
furniture out of his ass.

3936
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:45,730
Remember that from a Jerky boys.

3937
01:37:46,210 --> 01:37:47,043
I'm also known,

3938
01:37:51,130 --> 01:37:52,360
so I'll have to,

3939
01:37:52,361 --> 01:37:52,620
dude,

3940
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:56,500
I listen to some jerky boys the
other day and was fucking hilarious.

3941
01:37:56,501 --> 01:37:58,780
I forgot how funny the shit was.

3942
01:37:59,140 --> 01:38:00,940
How do those guys stopped doing that?

3943
01:38:00,941 --> 01:38:05,941
What happened there was so good because
the rules change with telephone calls

3944
01:38:06,341 --> 01:38:07,590
and people remember that.

3945
01:38:07,591 --> 01:38:09,730
Then they changed it where
you can only do it in Vegas.

3946
01:38:09,790 --> 01:38:11,020
You can only do it in Nevada.

3947
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:15,100
Like make prank calls cause
all kinds of legal shit.

3948
01:38:15,101 --> 01:38:16,930
Plus people started getting,

3949
01:38:16,931 --> 01:38:18,370
getting onto it because they,

3950
01:38:18,371 --> 01:38:18,551
you know,

3951
01:38:18,551 --> 01:38:19,600
they're becoming famous.

3952
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:23,290
That's why I wonder what the impractical
jokers you ever see that show?

3953
01:38:23,890 --> 01:38:24,320
Uh,

3954
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:24,791
I haven't seen it.

3955
01:38:24,791 --> 01:38:25,341
Check it out.

3956
01:38:25,341 --> 01:38:26,260
It's really good.

3957
01:38:26,270 --> 01:38:26,631
Funny.

3958
01:38:26,631 --> 01:38:26,810
Yeah.

3959
01:38:26,810 --> 01:38:27,380
Excellent.

3960
01:38:27,380 --> 01:38:32,150
Did you hear about those practical jokers
that committed suicide in Australia?

3961
01:38:32,790 --> 01:38:33,550
What,

3962
01:38:33,550 --> 01:38:34,380
what happened?

3963
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:35,213
Do you know?

3964
01:38:35,530 --> 01:38:35,831
Yeah,

3965
01:38:35,831 --> 01:38:37,270
so there was a hospital,

3966
01:38:37,271 --> 01:38:38,220
the WHO,

3967
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:43,240
who is there or the queen or the
princess or what's the duchess,

3968
01:38:44,930 --> 01:38:45,880
the duchess,

3969
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:46,390
whatever.

3970
01:38:46,390 --> 01:38:46,780
All right.

3971
01:38:46,780 --> 01:38:48,040
Some royalty was there.

3972
01:38:48,270 --> 01:38:48,991
And so,

3973
01:38:48,991 --> 01:38:49,420
uh,

3974
01:38:49,420 --> 01:38:52,040
this radio station had this prank
where they're going to act like the,

3975
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:53,080
the mom.

3976
01:38:53,170 --> 01:38:54,280
So I guess the Queen,

3977
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:54,820
uh,

3978
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:55,660
and they were controlled.

3979
01:38:56,190 --> 01:38:58,780
And so they operate or like they
called up and they were like,

3980
01:38:58,990 --> 01:38:59,260
oh no,

3981
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:00,250
I would like to speak to my daughter,

3982
01:39:00,251 --> 01:39:01,084
I don't eat or whatever.

3983
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:02,980
And the operator just
let her through like,

3984
01:39:03,010 --> 01:39:03,670
Oh yes,

3985
01:39:03,670 --> 01:39:04,481
one second please.

3986
01:39:04,481 --> 01:39:05,141
Instead of like,

3987
01:39:05,141 --> 01:39:05,381
you know,

3988
01:39:05,381 --> 01:39:07,600
like how do I know this
is the right person?

3989
01:39:07,601 --> 01:39:08,434
And stuff like that.

3990
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:09,220
And then,

3991
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:09,880
uh,

3992
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:13,390
they did this prank on the radio
station and I guess as you know,

3993
01:39:13,391 --> 01:39:17,140
because of the royal keeps trade
crown and she killed herself,

3994
01:39:17,141 --> 01:39:17,974
had herself,

3995
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:19,020
if my,

3996
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:19,740
my,

3997
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:20,070
my,

3998
01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:23,220
my granddaughter Kate
is my grand daughter,

3999
01:39:23,221 --> 01:39:24,450
Kate there please,

4000
01:39:24,510 --> 01:39:29,510
or she wasn't 30 said they
like immediately the people
on the phone really did

4001
01:39:30,270 --> 01:39:33,660
immediately give up information
about her condition.

4002
01:39:33,661 --> 01:39:35,880
Like they started just
rattling off the information.

4003
01:39:36,150 --> 01:39:37,590
They didn't like double check at all.

4004
01:39:37,591 --> 01:39:39,030
They weren't even remotely suspicious.

4005
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:40,620
Talk about fucking up your day though.

4006
01:39:40,621 --> 01:39:40,950
Huh?

4007
01:39:40,950 --> 01:39:41,191
I mean,

4008
01:39:41,191 --> 01:39:41,760
everybody,

4009
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:42,750
everybody loses.

4010
01:39:42,930 --> 01:39:43,763
Yeah,

4011
01:39:44,150 --> 01:39:45,380
the girl's dead.

4012
01:39:45,910 --> 01:39:46,200
The,

4013
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:46,391
the,

4014
01:39:46,391 --> 01:39:46,671
the,

4015
01:39:46,671 --> 01:39:49,660
the hospital security's a question now.

4016
01:39:49,661 --> 01:39:51,430
And these people lose their jobs.

4017
01:39:51,790 --> 01:39:53,230
They just meant to get a laugh.

4018
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:54,251
Yeah.

4019
01:39:54,251 --> 01:39:56,080
Morrissey is really interesting.

4020
01:39:56,081 --> 01:39:56,291
You know,

4021
01:39:56,291 --> 01:39:56,891
Marcy,

4022
01:39:56,891 --> 01:39:57,730
the the singer,

4023
01:39:57,940 --> 01:39:59,980
he's blaming the,

4024
01:40:00,010 --> 01:40:00,430
um,

4025
01:40:00,430 --> 01:40:05,320
he's blaming Kate Middleton for the death
cause he's saying the arrogance of the

4026
01:40:05,321 --> 01:40:08,290
British royals is staggering
and that's why we're,

4027
01:40:08,350 --> 01:40:08,800
uh,

4028
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:09,760
and why it's allowed.

4029
01:40:09,761 --> 01:40:10,690
I really don't know.

4030
01:40:10,870 --> 01:40:11,410
So He's,

4031
01:40:11,410 --> 01:40:12,580
he's saying that

4032
01:40:14,380 --> 01:40:16,600
the recent story about
the nurse killing herself,

4033
01:40:16,690 --> 01:40:21,640
there's no blame placed on Kate Middleton
who was at the hospital for as far as

4034
01:40:21,641 --> 01:40:22,211
I can see.

4035
01:40:22,211 --> 01:40:23,140
No reason.

4036
01:40:23,410 --> 01:40:26,260
She feels no shame about
the death of this woman.

4037
01:40:26,380 --> 01:40:29,290
She's saying nothing about
the death of this poor woman.

4038
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:30,461
Boy.

4039
01:40:30,461 --> 01:40:32,440
Morrissey needs a fucking hug.

4040
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:34,960
What a depressed guy.

4041
01:40:35,380 --> 01:40:35,921
What does that mean?

4042
01:40:35,921 --> 01:40:38,680
How does he know what
another person feels?

4043
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:40,030
How can he say like,

4044
01:40:40,031 --> 01:40:41,080
she feels nothing.

4045
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:41,580
How,

4046
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:42,460
how can you,

4047
01:40:42,461 --> 01:40:43,510
how can you really say that?

4048
01:40:44,130 --> 01:40:44,560
Um,

4049
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:45,161
what is,

4050
01:40:45,161 --> 01:40:48,040
what is someone say when someone
commits suicide over a prank?

4051
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:48,530
Like that?

4052
01:40:48,530 --> 01:40:49,080
Yeah,

4053
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:51,040
but you can't say she feels no shame.

4054
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:52,540
She's saying nothing.

4055
01:40:52,690 --> 01:40:53,050
How did,

4056
01:40:53,050 --> 01:40:53,250
does she,

4057
01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:55,410
is she supposed to say
something publicly about that?

4058
01:40:55,411 --> 01:40:55,860
I mean,

4059
01:40:55,860 --> 01:40:56,151
what,

4060
01:40:56,151 --> 01:40:58,440
what obligations do you have to,

4061
01:40:58,570 --> 01:40:59,403
she has,

4062
01:40:59,580 --> 01:40:59,911
yeah,

4063
01:40:59,911 --> 01:41:00,930
she has nothing to do with it.

4064
01:41:00,931 --> 01:41:04,380
What obligations does she have to
comment on something that's obviously a

4065
01:41:04,381 --> 01:41:05,220
horrific thing.

4066
01:41:05,430 --> 01:41:07,260
And you know,

4067
01:41:07,261 --> 01:41:08,130
to blame her,

4068
01:41:08,131 --> 01:41:09,270
that's so ridiculous.

4069
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:11,340
Silly Morrissey,

4070
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:14,580
the idea of the royal
family is crazy though,

4071
01:41:14,970 --> 01:41:16,470
that the fact that you could give a fuck,

4072
01:41:16,590 --> 01:41:17,820
CNN had it on,

4073
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:18,720
it was the,

4074
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,190
the problems in Gaza.

4075
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:20,551
Okay.

4076
01:41:20,551 --> 01:41:24,210
And CNN was talking about the dangers of
Gaza showed like some night vision with

4077
01:41:24,211 --> 01:41:25,740
a bomb going off and shit like that.

4078
01:41:25,741 --> 01:41:26,574
And then they said,

4079
01:41:26,790 --> 01:41:27,810
and you know,

4080
01:41:27,811 --> 01:41:28,620
Royal Kate,

4081
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:29,970
whatever the fuck her name is,

4082
01:41:29,971 --> 01:41:30,900
is pregnant,

4083
01:41:31,050 --> 01:41:33,870
there will be another baby baby.

4084
01:41:34,010 --> 01:41:34,843
But you know,

4085
01:41:34,850 --> 01:41:35,683
next to it.

4086
01:41:35,810 --> 01:41:36,290
Yeah,

4087
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:36,801
I know.

4088
01:41:36,801 --> 01:41:37,050
It's,

4089
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:38,660
and it stands cause itself.

4090
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:41,053
It's crazy.

4091
01:41:41,270 --> 01:41:41,541
Joe.

4092
01:41:41,541 --> 01:41:42,490
I was in uh,

4093
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:46,850
Canada and when the Queen Mother
died at 102 I had a bit about her,

4094
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,271
you know,

4095
01:41:47,271 --> 01:41:47,601
about it,

4096
01:41:47,601 --> 01:41:48,050
you know,

4097
01:41:48,050 --> 01:41:49,460
like she looked 101,

4098
01:41:49,461 --> 01:41:52,340
this whole thing she got
on the treadmill thing.

4099
01:41:52,700 --> 01:41:53,600
But uh,

4100
01:41:54,050 --> 01:41:54,290
I,

4101
01:41:54,290 --> 01:41:55,610
when I did it in Montreal,

4102
01:41:55,670 --> 01:41:56,750
it got an applause.

4103
01:41:57,050 --> 01:41:59,150
It's interesting how
people react to royalty.

4104
01:41:59,390 --> 01:42:00,470
When I did it in Ottawa,

4105
01:42:00,530 --> 01:42:04,010
which is more mixed Montreals mostly
French and a French and English,

4106
01:42:04,011 --> 01:42:04,844
but they're not,

4107
01:42:05,540 --> 01:42:08,120
they're not under the auspices
of the crown by any stretch.

4108
01:42:09,230 --> 01:42:10,063
Ottawa,

4109
01:42:10,370 --> 01:42:10,880
it a little bit,

4110
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:11,121
you know,

4111
01:42:11,121 --> 01:42:11,954
laugh,

4112
01:42:12,020 --> 01:42:12,860
mild applause,

4113
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:14,840
Toronto and nothing.

4114
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:16,011
Nothing.

4115
01:42:16,011 --> 01:42:17,500
Not a fucking sound.

4116
01:42:18,370 --> 01:42:18,530
Yeah,

4117
01:42:18,530 --> 01:42:18,741
it did.

4118
01:42:18,741 --> 01:42:22,580
An American would have the arrogance
to come up and do something against the

4119
01:42:22,581 --> 01:42:24,470
Queen and that funny,

4120
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:25,970
like the same fucking job,

4121
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,150
just a couple of hundred miles

4122
01:42:27,150 --> 01:42:27,960
west boom.

4123
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:32,910
Now it's very weird when you see people
that are really like it taken into the

4124
01:42:32,940 --> 01:42:34,380
royal family thing.

4125
01:42:34,410 --> 01:42:36,350
The oils like leave the royals,

4126
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,550
they live their lives
that they read about them,

4127
01:42:38,551 --> 01:42:40,350
like as if their thoughts are more,

4128
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:41,250
more important.

4129
01:42:41,251 --> 01:42:41,850
And yeah,

4130
01:42:41,850 --> 01:42:42,141
I was,

4131
01:42:42,141 --> 01:42:45,090
I'm making fun of the Queen when I was,

4132
01:42:45,091 --> 01:42:45,390
uh,

4133
01:42:45,390 --> 01:42:46,890
when I was in England one time,

4134
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:48,720
I forgot which town were around,

4135
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:50,460
but it wasn't like London,

4136
01:42:50,730 --> 01:42:51,151
London.

4137
01:42:51,151 --> 01:42:52,500
They probably would have
laughed their asses off,

4138
01:42:52,501 --> 01:42:53,590
but these people were like,

4139
01:42:53,790 --> 01:42:54,121
oh yeah,

4140
01:42:54,121 --> 01:42:55,400
you gotta Watch Manchester.

4141
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:57,270
While I don't remember what town it was.

4142
01:42:57,410 --> 01:42:58,440
It wasn't Manchester.

4143
01:42:58,680 --> 01:42:59,550
Maybe it was new castle,

4144
01:42:59,650 --> 01:43:00,483
maybe was Newcastle.

4145
01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:01,020
Anyway,

4146
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:01,860
wherever I was,

4147
01:43:02,380 --> 01:43:03,213
um,

4148
01:43:03,590 --> 01:43:04,440
I had this,

4149
01:43:04,441 --> 01:43:04,740
uh,

4150
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:09,740
this whole bit about how people like try
to pretend that like that this queen,

4151
01:43:10,681 --> 01:43:13,770
this woman was like really like a queen.

4152
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:17,340
Like you know that Princess Diana
really was actually a princess.

4153
01:43:17,370 --> 01:43:17,551
Like,

4154
01:43:17,551 --> 01:43:17,671
no,

4155
01:43:17,671 --> 01:43:18,660
that's just a person.

4156
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:19,291
Like,

4157
01:43:19,291 --> 01:43:22,190
and she's a woman who didn't
even have a job and you know,

4158
01:43:22,191 --> 01:43:22,490
and,

4159
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:23,110
and she tried,

4160
01:43:23,110 --> 01:43:25,980
she had a woman with children who
tried to kill herself like three times,

4161
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:26,641
you know,

4162
01:43:26,641 --> 01:43:26,971
and I'm like,

4163
01:43:26,971 --> 01:43:31,340
how many people would be in
that same position and Leno and,

4164
01:43:31,410 --> 01:43:34,710
and be incredibly fortunate and feel
so happy that they have all this money.

4165
01:43:34,711 --> 01:43:37,360
How many poor people
would love to be married?

4166
01:43:37,860 --> 01:43:38,693
Wealth?

4167
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:39,360
And she was like,

4168
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:40,230
oh no,

4169
01:43:40,530 --> 01:43:42,180
the tiers code,

4170
01:43:42,181 --> 01:43:43,550
the crumpets a stale,

4171
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:44,760
where's the razor?

4172
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:50,200
I cannot possibly go on the tabloids
showed you a photo of my backside quickly

4173
01:43:50,461 --> 01:43:53,000
drained the pool that
will die from the roof.

4174
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:54,830
This is horrid.

4175
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:55,941
Horrid.

4176
01:43:55,941 --> 01:43:56,840
Life cannot go on.

4177
01:43:56,841 --> 01:43:59,900
And I have like a whole series of those
fucking things and they didn't know how

4178
01:43:59,901 --> 01:44:00,350
to react.

4179
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:00,920
Oh yeah,

4180
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:01,581
they started,

4181
01:44:01,581 --> 01:44:02,091
they still like,

4182
01:44:02,091 --> 01:44:02,850
you could see people like,

4183
01:44:02,850 --> 01:44:03,530
oh,

4184
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:03,950
oh,

4185
01:44:03,950 --> 01:44:05,450
oh that's cause you're American too.

4186
01:44:05,690 --> 01:44:06,170
But they got,

4187
01:44:06,170 --> 01:44:06,770
they went with it.

4188
01:44:06,770 --> 01:44:07,281
They went with it.

4189
01:44:07,281 --> 01:44:07,910
Eventually,

4190
01:44:07,910 --> 01:44:08,750
eventually I beat,

4191
01:44:08,751 --> 01:44:10,760
I beat them down with
it cause it's just like,

4192
01:44:10,761 --> 01:44:11,300
come on.

4193
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:12,590
It sucks when everybody dies.

4194
01:44:12,650 --> 01:44:13,580
It's like this is not a,

4195
01:44:13,970 --> 01:44:14,691
you don't need royals.

4196
01:44:14,691 --> 01:44:18,650
You don't need the ancestors of the
people who suppressed your ancestors and

4197
01:44:18,651 --> 01:44:19,910
give them some special favors.

4198
01:44:19,911 --> 01:44:20,744
This is crazy.

4199
01:44:21,050 --> 01:44:21,260
You know,

4200
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:21,990
that's like,

4201
01:44:21,990 --> 01:44:23,930
but they're holding on to
that shit somehow or another.

4202
01:44:23,931 --> 01:44:25,820
And they've gone from being these,

4203
01:44:26,030 --> 01:44:26,390
uh,

4204
01:44:26,390 --> 01:44:27,860
these horrible dictators,

4205
01:44:27,890 --> 01:44:32,890
which they used to be to these weird
sort of benevolent people wave and hold

4206
01:44:33,510 --> 01:44:34,970
some strange position of,

4207
01:44:34,971 --> 01:44:35,271
of,

4208
01:44:35,271 --> 01:44:36,440
of like a,

4209
01:44:36,441 --> 01:44:38,330
a like a social example,

4210
01:44:38,450 --> 01:44:38,750
you know,

4211
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:40,460
example of the perfect etiquette,

4212
01:44:40,461 --> 01:44:41,510
the perfect behavior.

4213
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:42,020
Yeah.

4214
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:43,730
I mean at least the pope was elected.

4215
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:44,540
Yeah.

4216
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:44,961
Not that,

4217
01:44:44,961 --> 01:44:45,310
you know,

4218
01:44:45,310 --> 01:44:47,840
not that his wealth that
shouldn't be in question two,

4219
01:44:47,841 --> 01:44:49,400
but they were just born into it.

4220
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:50,180
It's craziness.

4221
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:52,780
And then marrying into it
is even more hilarious.

4222
01:44:52,781 --> 01:44:54,020
They're over such as prejudice.

4223
01:44:54,650 --> 01:44:55,580
It's fucking nuts.

4224
01:44:55,581 --> 01:44:56,810
And everybody's following it.

4225
01:44:56,840 --> 01:44:58,630
I mean it's like so dumb.

4226
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:01,600
Who was the one that gave
up the crown because he,

4227
01:45:02,170 --> 01:45:02,640
he,

4228
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:06,620
he wanted to marry somebody remembered
that one of the guys gave up the crown.

4229
01:45:06,621 --> 01:45:11,621
Can you imagine how fucking hot that
bed to give up the fucking cram?

4230
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:12,141
Yeah.

4231
01:45:12,141 --> 01:45:14,770
Well I bet in England
like being a royal is,

4232
01:45:14,910 --> 01:45:15,980
what do you think it's better though?

4233
01:45:16,070 --> 01:45:19,880
England or like in like Saudi Arabia or
something like that and like a Middle

4234
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:21,530
Eastern country and uh,

4235
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:22,730
you say that though,

4236
01:45:22,731 --> 01:45:25,310
but those Saudi Arabian
guys rocket way better.

4237
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:25,541
Yeah.

4238
01:45:25,541 --> 01:45:26,170
They,

4239
01:45:26,170 --> 01:45:27,110
the Middle Eastern guys,

4240
01:45:27,111 --> 01:45:29,840
they rock it the right way
when they want to go balls out.

4241
01:45:29,870 --> 01:45:30,021
Yeah,

4242
01:45:30,021 --> 01:45:30,600
they do it.

4243
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:35,600
I would pay girls hundreds of thousands
of dollars to be sex slaves and then

4244
01:45:36,471 --> 01:45:38,330
they have definitely,

4245
01:45:38,710 --> 01:45:40,610
cause you're not judged as much.

4246
01:45:40,820 --> 01:45:42,890
Nobody is rocking it.

4247
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:46,150
Like those young chic
dudes that have those like,

4248
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:47,390
like that one guy,

4249
01:45:47,391 --> 01:45:48,530
the sultan of Brunei,

4250
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:49,371
that guy,

4251
01:45:49,371 --> 01:45:54,110
he's the guy that has like the famous
parties where he will fly out like the

4252
01:45:54,111 --> 01:45:54,681
hottest women.

4253
01:45:54,681 --> 01:45:56,930
Apparently it was like a dirty
secret for the longest time.

4254
01:45:57,110 --> 01:45:57,950
Pre-Internet.

4255
01:45:58,130 --> 01:46:02,510
He would get like the all the hottest
penthouse paths actresses and shit that

4256
01:46:02,511 --> 01:46:02,920
like,

4257
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:03,171
you know,

4258
01:46:03,171 --> 01:46:06,320
weren't doing so well because you could
go over there and you could make like an

4259
01:46:06,321 --> 01:46:07,154
insect.

4260
01:46:07,450 --> 01:46:09,890
I'll give her a call and I'm not joking.

4261
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:10,310
Yeah.

4262
01:46:10,310 --> 01:46:13,700
And I got a Gig with those
guys and they sent me a watch.

4263
01:46:13,701 --> 01:46:14,930
There was worth like 20 grand.

4264
01:46:15,010 --> 01:46:15,860
It's like ridiculous.

4265
01:46:16,340 --> 01:46:19,480
And they were asking me about Italian
batch were just so fucking funny from

4266
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:21,960
Saudis that they knew
like Joey bag of donuts.

4267
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:22,641
That's fun.

4268
01:46:22,641 --> 01:46:23,474
It's old shit.

4269
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:24,620
That's hilarious.

4270
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,350
There's those guys have so
much money that this guy,

4271
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:27,891
the salt,

4272
01:46:27,891 --> 01:46:30,020
no Brunei apparently has
a disco in his house,

4273
01:46:30,990 --> 01:46:31,791
makes his own discount,

4274
01:46:31,791 --> 01:46:32,690
which is beautiful.

4275
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:37,720
Unbelievably lavishly appointed disco
gold gilded work on the ceiling and

4276
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:41,920
magnificent and just filled with tens.

4277
01:46:42,170 --> 01:46:47,170
She's tens everywhere and this guy just
goes out there and slides amongst them.

4278
01:46:47,211 --> 01:46:51,120
It has a cocktail mingles mixes with
the next group or they're all trying to

4279
01:46:51,121 --> 01:46:53,100
impress him and they're
all trying to compete.

4280
01:46:53,130 --> 01:46:54,450
And it was him and a few of his friends,

4281
01:46:54,451 --> 01:46:55,040
I guess.

4282
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:57,030
I think it just fucking bang them.

4283
01:46:57,240 --> 01:47:02,240
Just walk every night and every night
he's fishing in this stock pond.

4284
01:47:02,910 --> 01:47:03,151
I mean,

4285
01:47:03,151 --> 01:47:03,930
it's really the,

4286
01:47:03,930 --> 01:47:07,020
nobody's ever been such a
baller because he's not,

4287
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:09,540
he's not actually enslaving anybody.

4288
01:47:09,541 --> 01:47:11,610
He's paying them significant
amounts of money.

4289
01:47:11,790 --> 01:47:12,121
Okay?

4290
01:47:12,121 --> 01:47:13,560
He's not corrupting their morals.

4291
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:14,730
They're willing to do this.

4292
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:15,220
Okay.

4293
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:18,740
There's nothing wrong with the exchange
because the amount of money to make an

4294
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:20,400
is really fucking staggering.

4295
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:24,300
But when you really stop and think about
like how many guys have ever done it

4296
01:47:24,301 --> 01:47:24,960
like that?

4297
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:26,940
The Sultan of Brunei is
probably doing it the nicest.

4298
01:47:26,980 --> 01:47:29,070
Wherever everybody else who did it,

4299
01:47:29,190 --> 01:47:30,240
they did it with armies.

4300
01:47:30,420 --> 01:47:30,840
You know,

4301
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:31,081
every,

4302
01:47:31,081 --> 01:47:32,700
every other guy that's
like lived like that,

4303
01:47:32,701 --> 01:47:34,790
they did it with swords and you know,

4304
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:37,800
conquering towns and keeping
chicks in cages and shit.

4305
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:41,520
This guy just pays him stupid
amounts of money based on oil money.

4306
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:42,593
Wow.

4307
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:43,910
That sounds like fun.

4308
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:44,491
I mean,

4309
01:47:44,491 --> 01:47:49,430
I think pre Prince Charles is kind of
sad because he's at the point now where

4310
01:47:49,431 --> 01:47:49,731
he's like,

4311
01:47:49,731 --> 01:47:50,541
he loves his mother,

4312
01:47:50,541 --> 01:47:50,990
but you know,

4313
01:47:50,990 --> 01:47:51,351
mom,

4314
01:47:51,351 --> 01:47:52,430
could you die already?

4315
01:47:52,490 --> 01:47:56,580
So it can be King Charles
to be king before I'm 70 do
you know if she lives to a

4316
01:47:56,581 --> 01:47:58,880
hundred you know what the
fuck's going to happen to him?

4317
01:47:59,180 --> 01:47:59,720
Yeah.

4318
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:00,560
She might outlive live him.

4319
01:48:00,860 --> 01:48:01,250
Yeah,

4320
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:02,090
it's possible.

4321
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:02,953
Oh sure.

4322
01:48:03,740 --> 01:48:05,180
You know who's under more stress?

4323
01:48:05,330 --> 01:48:05,480
No,

4324
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:07,190
she's probably just nice and slow all day.

4325
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:09,320
He's running around doing shit,

4326
01:48:09,790 --> 01:48:11,090
trying to fucking make ends meet.

4327
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:12,290
Trying to put food on the table.

4328
01:48:12,550 --> 01:48:13,121
Dot.

4329
01:48:13,121 --> 01:48:13,780
My rarer.

4330
01:48:13,780 --> 01:48:14,613
They're poor prince.

4331
01:48:14,630 --> 01:48:15,680
What does that guy do all day?

4332
01:48:16,090 --> 01:48:17,890
[inaudible] you know,

4333
01:48:18,050 --> 01:48:18,980
she still play snooker.

4334
01:48:21,050 --> 01:48:22,040
Did you look something up?

4335
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,233
Yeah,

4336
01:48:23,820 --> 01:48:28,280
but holes and fireworks and I just got
really lost and I found an old article

4337
01:48:28,850 --> 01:48:32,530
from 91 where you were with
Ellen doing comedy and,

4338
01:48:32,531 --> 01:48:33,980
and Miami or something like that.

4339
01:48:33,981 --> 01:48:34,880
Do you ever Bang her

4340
01:48:35,070 --> 01:48:35,611
Ellen degeneres?

4341
01:48:35,611 --> 01:48:35,880
Yeah.

4342
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:36,713
Oh,

4343
01:48:37,130 --> 01:48:37,480
Hey,

4344
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:38,180
talk to this week.

4345
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:38,340
Sorry.

4346
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:39,090
I gotta take a leak.

4347
01:48:39,090 --> 01:48:39,331
No,

4348
01:48:39,331 --> 01:48:40,410
I never bagged down now.

4349
01:48:40,530 --> 01:48:41,310
I Love Ellen.

4350
01:48:41,310 --> 01:48:42,143
I know.

4351
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:42,380
No,

4352
01:48:42,380 --> 01:48:43,171
I worked with her,

4353
01:48:43,171 --> 01:48:43,590
uh,

4354
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:44,730
that worked at her in Miami too.

4355
01:48:44,830 --> 01:48:45,570
If it's something,

4356
01:48:45,570 --> 01:48:48,970
it looks like it was 91
that you worked with her.

4357
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:49,960
I know I worked with her.

4358
01:48:49,970 --> 01:48:53,740
Would see I need to
Atlantic city 92 for Hbo,

4359
01:48:53,741 --> 01:48:54,670
one night stand maybe.

4360
01:48:55,150 --> 01:48:55,661
Oh,

4361
01:48:55,661 --> 01:48:56,494
okay.

4362
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:57,480
She's,

4363
01:48:57,480 --> 01:48:58,400
I didn't remember it all and do it.

4364
01:48:58,430 --> 01:48:58,671
I mean,

4365
01:48:58,671 --> 01:48:59,421
I know she did one,

4366
01:48:59,421 --> 01:49:00,260
but I didn't know she did it,

4367
01:49:00,350 --> 01:49:00,690
uh,

4368
01:49:00,690 --> 01:49:01,790
the same night as me.

4369
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:03,133
Maybe she did,

4370
01:49:03,890 --> 01:49:05,350
but a great standup.

4371
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:05,810
Ellen.

4372
01:49:05,810 --> 01:49:06,051
Yeah.

4373
01:49:06,051 --> 01:49:09,860
And did you ever know anyone that dated
her or was she always kind of like a

4374
01:49:09,890 --> 01:49:10,723
lesbian until the,

4375
01:49:11,090 --> 01:49:11,841
I didn't know,

4376
01:49:11,841 --> 01:49:12,350
you know,

4377
01:49:12,350 --> 01:49:13,550
I didn't know she was lesbian,

4378
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:14,360
but I,

4379
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:14,880
I,

4380
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:16,010
I certainly approve of it.

4381
01:49:16,310 --> 01:49:16,990
Yeah.

4382
01:49:16,990 --> 01:49:18,550
Who was your gang like,

4383
01:49:18,580 --> 01:49:18,910
like,

4384
01:49:18,910 --> 01:49:19,390
you know,

4385
01:49:19,390 --> 01:49:20,500
when you were starting out?

4386
01:49:20,530 --> 01:49:21,281
Shecky Greene.

4387
01:49:21,281 --> 01:49:21,430
Yeah.

4388
01:49:21,430 --> 01:49:22,420
Bob Hope.

4389
01:49:22,510 --> 01:49:23,141
Bob Hope.

4390
01:49:23,141 --> 01:49:23,500
Really?

4391
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:24,041
No,

4392
01:49:24,041 --> 01:49:25,780
can't come off that fucking old.

4393
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:27,160
Who is my gang?

4394
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:27,790
Uh,

4395
01:49:27,790 --> 01:49:29,950
well I think a comic strip.

4396
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:35,040
It was like Seinfeld and Paul Riser
and Mark Schiff and these guys.

4397
01:49:35,370 --> 01:49:36,203
Uh,

4398
01:49:36,380 --> 01:49:37,590
and at the Improv,

4399
01:49:37,630 --> 01:49:38,463
uh,

4400
01:49:38,540 --> 01:49:39,840
with John Mendoza,

4401
01:49:39,870 --> 01:49:41,520
Carol Siskin and enough,

4402
01:49:41,521 --> 01:49:41,701
you know,

4403
01:49:41,701 --> 01:49:42,181
those guys.

4404
01:49:42,181 --> 01:49:44,850
But they were good friends and uh,

4405
01:49:46,290 --> 01:49:49,140
I would say was the most
famous that came out of that,

4406
01:49:49,290 --> 01:49:49,830
that channel.

4407
01:49:49,830 --> 01:49:51,180
He was a little bit before me.

4408
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:52,021
I was,

4409
01:49:52,021 --> 01:49:53,310
I was acting still.

4410
01:49:53,311 --> 01:49:54,840
And Jerry was a standup already.

4411
01:49:55,980 --> 01:49:58,320
I paid to see don my rarer
before I ever did comedy.

4412
01:49:58,690 --> 01:49:59,190
Yeah.

4413
01:49:59,190 --> 01:50:00,023
If I,

4414
01:50:00,090 --> 01:50:00,691
if I,

4415
01:50:00,691 --> 01:50:01,410
um,

4416
01:50:01,410 --> 01:50:02,430
had done comedy,

4417
01:50:02,431 --> 01:50:04,020
I'd only done it like maybe once or twice.

4418
01:50:04,410 --> 01:50:04,770
Awesome.

4419
01:50:04,770 --> 01:50:05,480
Nick's right.

4420
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:05,810
Yeah.

4421
01:50:05,810 --> 01:50:06,580
Yeah.

4422
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:07,710
The funny was a place,

4423
01:50:07,711 --> 01:50:07,980
Joe,

4424
01:50:07,980 --> 01:50:09,840
not only did I say
[inaudible] Dahmer at next,

4425
01:50:09,870 --> 01:50:14,400
I paid two nights in a row because dom
could make in one night and his plane was

4426
01:50:14,580 --> 01:50:15,840
delayed or something like that.

4427
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:16,860
And Denis Leary,

4428
01:50:16,950 --> 01:50:17,280
uh,

4429
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:19,680
went up and that's how I
found out about Denis leary.

4430
01:50:20,790 --> 01:50:23,040
And Denis leary became my
favorite comedian for six months.

4431
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:24,020
But I,

4432
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:24,390
uh,

4433
01:50:24,390 --> 01:50:24,931
I paid,

4434
01:50:24,931 --> 01:50:25,410
uh,

4435
01:50:25,410 --> 01:50:27,780
we had some good shows on there
where before we were ever friends.

4436
01:50:28,430 --> 01:50:29,030
Yeah.

4437
01:50:29,030 --> 01:50:30,660
That place is a classic place.

4438
01:50:30,750 --> 01:50:31,650
So these people,

4439
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:32,450
um,

4440
01:50:32,450 --> 01:50:34,710
did they get fired or did they quit?

4441
01:50:35,450 --> 01:50:35,691
Uh,

4442
01:50:35,691 --> 01:50:36,111
they,

4443
01:50:36,111 --> 01:50:36,640
they,

4444
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:39,930
they said that they were going
to leave the radio show until,

4445
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:40,650
uh,

4446
01:50:40,650 --> 01:50:40,980
you know,

4447
01:50:40,980 --> 01:50:43,200
kind of tell a ship blows over.

4448
01:50:43,201 --> 01:50:46,950
It's a tough place to rebound to cause
such a small country if not in size,

4449
01:50:46,951 --> 01:50:47,820
but in population.

4450
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:50,520
I don't think you can blame that.

4451
01:50:50,530 --> 01:50:51,420
Know the guy.

4452
01:50:51,421 --> 01:50:52,590
They're just trying to be funny.

4453
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:54,320
If somebody would kill them.

4454
01:50:54,330 --> 01:50:57,390
So they thought that they would like have
a conversation with somebody who would

4455
01:50:57,391 --> 01:50:58,170
it be silly?

4456
01:50:58,170 --> 01:50:58,471
I mean,

4457
01:50:58,471 --> 01:51:00,060
they've done that before
with other people.

4458
01:51:00,090 --> 01:51:00,810
You know,

4459
01:51:00,810 --> 01:51:02,460
they did one of those with Sarah Pailin.

4460
01:51:02,461 --> 01:51:03,450
Remember those Canadian guys?

4461
01:51:03,451 --> 01:51:04,680
They called and they told Sarah Palin,

4462
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:05,633
Sarah Palin,

4463
01:51:05,670 --> 01:51:05,890
yeah,

4464
01:51:05,890 --> 01:51:06,960
nobody killed anybody,

4465
01:51:07,140 --> 01:51:08,190
and so they were okay,

4466
01:51:08,191 --> 01:51:10,770
but that this is not okay
because the lady kills herself.

4467
01:51:10,820 --> 01:51:11,181
That's it.

4468
01:51:11,181 --> 01:51:11,701
That's right.

4469
01:51:11,701 --> 01:51:12,421
It's craziness,

4470
01:51:12,421 --> 01:51:12,930
man.

4471
01:51:12,930 --> 01:51:14,190
You can't blame these people.

4472
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:15,240
You can say,

4473
01:51:15,570 --> 01:51:15,871
hey,

4474
01:51:15,871 --> 01:51:17,310
you shouldn't do prank calls anymore,

4475
01:51:17,311 --> 01:51:17,730
but I,

4476
01:51:17,730 --> 01:51:19,530
I don't think these people
should even be fired.

4477
01:51:19,740 --> 01:51:21,720
It's really what they
did was not a bad thing.

4478
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:23,370
It was a silly thing,

4479
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:24,540
but it's not a bad thing.

4480
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:27,120
The woman was in the hospital
because she wasn't feeling well.

4481
01:51:27,121 --> 01:51:27,871
It wasn't like,

4482
01:51:27,871 --> 01:51:28,440
you know,

4483
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:31,560
like there had been some horrible
accident and they were keeping medical

4484
01:51:31,561 --> 01:51:34,920
attention from her that was going to
save her life and it led to her death.

4485
01:51:34,950 --> 01:51:37,440
There was no obstruction
of health services.

4486
01:51:37,650 --> 01:51:39,030
It was just a silly thing.

4487
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:41,230
You can't blame these
people for a fucking site.

4488
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:41,701
I mean,

4489
01:51:41,701 --> 01:51:43,470
you don't know it's going
to backfire that much.

4490
01:51:43,471 --> 01:51:45,240
It's a bunch of pussies.

4491
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:46,253
But Marcy,

4492
01:51:46,270 --> 01:51:46,890
Ooh,

4493
01:51:46,890 --> 01:51:47,660
how annoying.

4494
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:48,493
Mustak IB.

4495
01:51:48,630 --> 01:51:53,100
Apparently Morrissey is a super vegan
and not only is he a vegetarian,

4496
01:51:53,101 --> 01:51:57,300
but he won't let anyone on his
crew eat any animals either.

4497
01:51:57,390 --> 01:51:59,850
So the crew guys will like get together,

4498
01:51:59,851 --> 01:52:03,060
they'll meet and one guy's room and
they order a bunch of Burgers for room

4499
01:52:03,061 --> 01:52:05,550
service and they hide and
one guy watches the door.

4500
01:52:05,730 --> 01:52:07,980
I'm not bullshit and I'm not bullshitting.

4501
01:52:07,981 --> 01:52:08,970
And they have to,

4502
01:52:08,971 --> 01:52:09,120
uh,

4503
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:12,540
they have to have a fucking backup plan
if Marcy comes and finds him in the

4504
01:52:12,541 --> 01:52:12,930
room.

4505
01:52:12,930 --> 01:52:13,800
I love the honey bit,

4506
01:52:13,801 --> 01:52:14,634
by the way,

4507
01:52:16,050 --> 01:52:17,280
but never thought of that.

4508
01:52:17,390 --> 01:52:18,060
You never thought of that?

4509
01:52:18,060 --> 01:52:18,893
Yeah.

4510
01:52:19,070 --> 01:52:20,550
If he can start supposed to eat honey,

4511
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:21,690
they're silly bitches.

4512
01:52:21,710 --> 01:52:21,850
No,

4513
01:52:21,850 --> 01:52:24,150
I'm sorry that I mentioned those
guys names because you said,

4514
01:52:24,190 --> 01:52:24,440
you know,

4515
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:26,450
I forget how powerful this show is now.

4516
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:27,630
Everybody's going to know who they are.

4517
01:52:28,410 --> 01:52:30,210
Well made them more famous.

4518
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:30,571
Oh,

4519
01:52:30,571 --> 01:52:31,321
well.

4520
01:52:31,321 --> 01:52:32,154
Oh boy.

4521
01:52:32,340 --> 01:52:35,120
Do you have any response to
dom Irrera calling you a cunt?

4522
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:36,250
I,

4523
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:36,750
Tom and I,

4524
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:39,280
we just need to get to get out
of the phone to kill this kid.

4525
01:52:39,540 --> 01:52:40,373
He says this,

4526
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:41,251
we bust balls.

4527
01:52:41,251 --> 01:52:41,551
Hey,

4528
01:52:41,551 --> 01:52:42,830
I was kidding.

4529
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:43,673
Bus Balls.

4530
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:44,940
I was speaking of busting,

4531
01:52:45,170 --> 01:52:46,160
I was listening to a,

4532
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:48,380
did you listen to or have you
been listening to ONA at all?

4533
01:52:49,510 --> 01:52:53,590
I know because they don't have
only a satellite in my old car.

4534
01:52:54,930 --> 01:52:55,700
You got it.

4535
01:52:55,700 --> 01:52:56,590
I have a tape deck.

4536
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:58,390
Why don't you get in your new car?

4537
01:52:58,600 --> 01:52:59,480
It was your new car.

4538
01:52:59,481 --> 01:53:00,314
Satellite Ready?

4539
01:53:00,350 --> 01:53:00,771
Yeah.

4540
01:53:00,771 --> 01:53:01,310
Yeah.

4541
01:53:01,310 --> 01:53:02,143
Just what do

4542
01:53:03,590 --> 01:53:03,921
they do it,

4543
01:53:03,921 --> 01:53:04,910
it's really funny lately.

4544
01:53:05,030 --> 01:53:05,781
Well it's always funny,

4545
01:53:05,781 --> 01:53:08,180
but lately they had on Joe Piscopo.

4546
01:53:08,260 --> 01:53:08,690
Hmm.

4547
01:53:08,690 --> 01:53:09,170
Oh Wow.

4548
01:53:09,170 --> 01:53:09,561
And uh,

4549
01:53:09,561 --> 01:53:09,821
they,

4550
01:53:09,821 --> 01:53:10,191
they,

4551
01:53:10,191 --> 01:53:10,730
you know,

4552
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:12,950
they were busting Joe Pisco
boasts balls on the air.

4553
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:13,813
It was fucking,

4554
01:53:13,930 --> 01:53:15,470
that was like muscle man think they,

4555
01:53:15,530 --> 01:53:15,741
well,

4556
01:53:15,741 --> 01:53:15,980
they,

4557
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:20,980
what they did was they played some shit
from like the 1990s when he was in love

4558
01:53:21,891 --> 01:53:25,940
with this girl and he had like some
show and like he sang for like,

4559
01:53:25,941 --> 01:53:27,770
you really sang to her.

4560
01:53:27,771 --> 01:53:29,200
And now,

4561
01:53:30,030 --> 01:53:31,850
apparently 20 years later,

4562
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:32,450
um,

4563
01:53:32,450 --> 01:53:33,200
he,

4564
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:34,200
he's uh,

4565
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:35,173
got it with these,

4566
01:53:35,180 --> 01:53:38,360
they've got restraining orders
against each other for domestic abuse.

4567
01:53:38,361 --> 01:53:39,650
They both have restraining orders

4568
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:43,510
and,

4569
01:53:43,510 --> 01:53:44,301
and you know,

4570
01:53:44,301 --> 01:53:44,991
he's got,

4571
01:53:44,991 --> 01:53:47,410
he became like Joe Piscopo.

4572
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:51,820
It became like this weird
sort of a caricature of who
he used to make fun of it.

4573
01:53:51,870 --> 01:53:52,431
Like that whole,

4574
01:53:52,431 --> 01:53:53,300
I'm from Jersey,

4575
01:53:53,630 --> 01:53:57,380
well now it's like he's
really weird become that.

4576
01:53:57,410 --> 01:53:57,621
Yeah.

4577
01:53:57,621 --> 01:53:59,900
And he tells like these
joke episcopal shows,

4578
01:53:59,901 --> 01:54:03,620
his live shows places and you fills
up these really small places and he's,

4579
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:04,101
you know,

4580
01:54:04,101 --> 01:54:05,710
kinda scratching by and try to it.

4581
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:09,590
And it's weird like hearing him get
fucked with by Opie and Anthony.

4582
01:54:09,591 --> 01:54:11,030
It was like really painful.

4583
01:54:11,031 --> 01:54:11,420
Like they were.

4584
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:11,870
Why would he,

4585
01:54:11,870 --> 01:54:12,800
why would he do the show?

4586
01:54:12,820 --> 01:54:13,460
Cause it gets,

4587
01:54:13,460 --> 01:54:15,770
it gets people paying attention
to them when people go see him.

4588
01:54:16,190 --> 01:54:17,300
Even as a goof.

4589
01:54:17,690 --> 01:54:18,051
I mean,

4590
01:54:18,051 --> 01:54:18,410
look,

4591
01:54:18,410 --> 01:54:20,750
I would go see it if I knew
that he was going to be in town.

4592
01:54:20,780 --> 01:54:21,471
I would go see it.

4593
01:54:21,471 --> 01:54:22,011
I would go see it.

4594
01:54:22,011 --> 01:54:22,844
Even if I'm,

4595
01:54:22,890 --> 01:54:24,830
I will go see a lot of things that I,

4596
01:54:25,220 --> 01:54:26,540
I'm pretty sure I'm going to suck.

4597
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:27,501
You know,

4598
01:54:27,501 --> 01:54:30,380
if it's going to be an
inexperienced comedically though,

4599
01:54:30,381 --> 01:54:31,220
you could sit through it.

4600
01:54:31,490 --> 01:54:32,540
I don't think it's comedy.

4601
01:54:33,130 --> 01:54:34,820
I think he's like singing thank,

4602
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:35,870
he's like singing songs.

4603
01:54:35,871 --> 01:54:36,201
I think.

4604
01:54:36,201 --> 01:54:36,620
I don't,

4605
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:38,000
I don't really think he's doing comedy.

4606
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:41,990
I think he's doing like a lot of Sinatra
songs and shit like that really did

4607
01:54:41,991 --> 01:54:42,501
stand up.

4608
01:54:42,501 --> 01:54:46,530
He did character pressures
of the sports caster.

4609
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:47,690
I'm an entertainer.

4610
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:48,553
I'm an entertainer.

4611
01:54:48,890 --> 01:54:49,700
I'm a triple threat,

4612
01:54:49,700 --> 01:54:50,600
but having him,

4613
01:54:51,770 --> 01:54:52,790
he does Sinatra.

4614
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:54,170
Who else does he do there?

4615
01:54:54,260 --> 01:54:55,010
The artists.

4616
01:54:55,010 --> 01:54:55,700
The comedian.

4617
01:54:55,700 --> 01:54:56,510
What does it say?

4618
01:54:56,510 --> 01:54:57,290
The comedian,

4619
01:54:57,290 --> 01:54:58,040
the performer.

4620
01:54:58,040 --> 01:54:58,880
Is that his website?

4621
01:54:59,070 --> 01:55:03,440
Bruce Springsteen to snatch a
Gella take you to in the audience.

4622
01:55:03,441 --> 01:55:04,490
I know a thrill ride.

4623
01:55:04,650 --> 01:55:05,830
Every lane follow up.

4624
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:06,590
Yeah,

4625
01:55:06,590 --> 01:55:07,600
seat belts.

4626
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:10,830
I think he's mostly doing
like impressions and Shit.

4627
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:11,290
Yeah,

4628
01:55:11,290 --> 01:55:12,123
that's the thing.

4629
01:55:12,330 --> 01:55:12,931
It's like a,

4630
01:55:12,931 --> 01:55:14,400
it's like an entertaining show.

4631
01:55:14,401 --> 01:55:14,561
Look,

4632
01:55:14,561 --> 01:55:14,951
look at him there.

4633
01:55:14,951 --> 01:55:15,030
Yeah.

4634
01:55:15,030 --> 01:55:15,721
Don't mind me.

4635
01:55:15,721 --> 01:55:16,554
I'm over here.

4636
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:17,260
Yes.

4637
01:55:17,260 --> 01:55:19,090
If you don't want to subscribe to serious,

4638
01:55:19,091 --> 01:55:23,050
I'm sure you listen to some of the clips
online like the people take them fans

4639
01:55:23,051 --> 01:55:23,884
do and they uh,

4640
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:26,290
they put them on youtube because
our show is still on here.

4641
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:28,530
He was one of the reasons I started
this probably goes down here.

4642
01:55:28,531 --> 01:55:29,620
I don't know all the time man.

4643
01:55:30,050 --> 01:55:31,420
The reasons I started doing standup,

4644
01:55:31,421 --> 01:55:33,070
that was hilarious because he was so bad.

4645
01:55:33,250 --> 01:55:36,400
I was getting hired for
Saturday night live and they,

4646
01:55:36,490 --> 01:55:38,380
cause Eddie Murphy like Joe,

4647
01:55:38,710 --> 01:55:40,000
the only two people that kept,

4648
01:55:40,001 --> 01:55:41,070
I got hired by shine that lap.

4649
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:44,340
They change producers and Eddie Murphy

4650
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:44,881
like Joe,

4651
01:55:44,881 --> 01:55:47,970
they were friends and they
kept Joe because of Eddie.

4652
01:55:48,450 --> 01:55:48,931
And you know,

4653
01:55:48,931 --> 01:55:51,360
Joe was fine on the show
it on him and put him down.

4654
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:52,194
But uh,

4655
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:53,101
I thought to myself,

4656
01:55:53,101 --> 01:55:53,820
fuck this,

4657
01:55:53,820 --> 01:55:54,840
I can do that.

4658
01:55:54,841 --> 01:55:55,740
I could do stand up,

4659
01:55:56,300 --> 01:55:56,610
you know,

4660
01:55:56,610 --> 01:56:01,020
I became a standard cause I didn't want
to deal with the fucking agents and Shit

4661
01:56:01,021 --> 01:56:01,740
and you know,

4662
01:56:01,740 --> 01:56:03,570
policy or was this 1980.

4663
01:56:04,050 --> 01:56:04,531
Wow.

4664
01:56:04,531 --> 01:56:09,150
So that's when you started standing up
best at the Improv and sad passed right

4665
01:56:09,151 --> 01:56:11,230
away because I was already
a polished performer,

4666
01:56:11,260 --> 01:56:12,020
not to be a jerk,

4667
01:56:12,020 --> 01:56:17,020
but I had done so much acting and Improv
that stand up all I was really okay.

4668
01:56:17,881 --> 01:56:21,090
I just had no act and I couldn't
understand how standards had to repeat

4669
01:56:21,091 --> 01:56:21,870
themselves to,

4670
01:56:21,870 --> 01:56:22,703
to hone it.

4671
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:24,210
That was the tough part for me,

4672
01:56:24,211 --> 01:56:24,570
you know,

4673
01:56:24,570 --> 01:56:27,640
so pissed Capone never
did a stand up and he did,

4674
01:56:28,290 --> 01:56:30,160
but he used to do this thing
where he'd come in and like,

4675
01:56:30,161 --> 01:56:30,760
you know,

4676
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:32,400
you could see right through
it and then he'd go,

4677
01:56:32,730 --> 01:56:33,511
hey everybody,

4678
01:56:33,511 --> 01:56:34,860
I just stopped in to say hello.

4679
01:56:35,370 --> 01:56:35,581
Right.

4680
01:56:35,581 --> 01:56:36,391
And they'd be clapping,

4681
01:56:36,391 --> 01:56:36,541
you know,

4682
01:56:36,541 --> 01:56:37,081
like in other words,

4683
01:56:37,081 --> 01:56:37,831
I'm saying hello,

4684
01:56:37,831 --> 01:56:38,760
which is good enough.

4685
01:56:38,780 --> 01:56:39,960
Now if I happen to be funny,

4686
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:40,831
great,

4687
01:56:40,831 --> 01:56:43,280
but don't expect me to be funny
because once I didn't live,

4688
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:45,320
oh see that's what he would say.

4689
01:56:46,470 --> 01:56:47,210
Hello.

4690
01:56:47,210 --> 01:56:47,790
Famous.

4691
01:56:47,790 --> 01:56:48,541
How famous was he?

4692
01:56:48,541 --> 01:56:49,680
At one point I was really famous.

4693
01:56:50,010 --> 01:56:52,050
He was famous enough to
be on Saturday night live,

4694
01:56:52,051 --> 01:56:52,351
you know,

4695
01:56:52,351 --> 01:56:52,801
like that.

4696
01:56:52,801 --> 01:56:53,850
He was a pretty big name.

4697
01:56:53,851 --> 01:56:54,601
I know who he is.

4698
01:56:54,601 --> 01:56:54,841
I mean,

4699
01:56:54,841 --> 01:56:56,190
I knew who he is when
I was in high school,

4700
01:56:56,191 --> 01:56:56,850
so he must be,

4701
01:56:56,850 --> 01:56:58,020
he must have been really famous.

4702
01:56:58,140 --> 01:56:58,771
That was the 80s.

4703
01:56:58,771 --> 01:57:03,210
I wasn't one that was 80 for 80 on
that was a few years after that.

4704
01:57:03,211 --> 01:57:04,830
I don't remember what
happened to him after that.

4705
01:57:05,170 --> 01:57:05,630
Uh,

4706
01:57:05,630 --> 01:57:06,690
he's always a nice guy,

4707
01:57:06,750 --> 01:57:07,111
you know,

4708
01:57:07,111 --> 01:57:07,381
I mean,

4709
01:57:07,381 --> 01:57:07,831
I just,

4710
01:57:07,831 --> 01:57:08,664
uh,

4711
01:57:08,850 --> 01:57:10,320
I don't think standup was his thing.

4712
01:57:10,350 --> 01:57:13,300
He was listening to Ona town apartments.

4713
01:57:13,510 --> 01:57:14,400
So brutal.

4714
01:57:14,430 --> 01:57:14,551
Well,

4715
01:57:14,551 --> 01:57:15,600
he's from a different era,

4716
01:57:15,850 --> 01:57:16,191
you know,

4717
01:57:16,191 --> 01:57:16,370
he's,

4718
01:57:16,370 --> 01:57:16,680
he's,

4719
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:19,170
we're a Sinatra era kind of.

4720
01:57:19,260 --> 01:57:19,681
Yeah.

4721
01:57:19,681 --> 01:57:21,090
And then even though
he's younger than that,

4722
01:57:21,180 --> 01:57:22,770
reading his tweets about it,

4723
01:57:22,771 --> 01:57:23,101
you know,

4724
01:57:23,101 --> 01:57:23,570
like,

4725
01:57:23,570 --> 01:57:25,870
like trying to like sort of
justify it and everything.

4726
01:57:25,871 --> 01:57:26,704
It's just like,

4727
01:57:26,910 --> 01:57:27,743
he's like,

4728
01:57:27,870 --> 01:57:31,230
he sacrifices himself so
he can get that attention,

4729
01:57:31,231 --> 01:57:33,690
but that is really the only
attention that he's getting really.

4730
01:57:33,691 --> 01:57:34,950
If you stop and think about it without,

4731
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:36,000
without that kind of stuff,

4732
01:57:36,001 --> 01:57:36,840
without opie and Anthony,

4733
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:38,340
they mean they really
are helping them out.

4734
01:57:38,700 --> 01:57:40,390
And Jim Norton actually
like put it on his,

4735
01:57:40,391 --> 01:57:40,681
uh,

4736
01:57:40,681 --> 01:57:41,221
his tweet,

4737
01:57:41,221 --> 01:57:41,400
like,

4738
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:41,551
oh,

4739
01:57:41,551 --> 01:57:41,991
go see you.

4740
01:57:41,991 --> 01:57:42,824
I'm like,

4741
01:57:42,870 --> 01:57:43,740
he's such a good guy.

4742
01:57:45,210 --> 01:57:46,440
He's a great guy.

4743
01:57:46,441 --> 01:57:47,160
He really is.

4744
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:48,240
He's my favorite performer.

4745
01:57:48,690 --> 01:57:52,090
He is because he's so unabashed
and unapologetic about it.

4746
01:57:52,390 --> 01:57:54,120
He talks about like Midi pussies.

4747
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:55,110
He's like,

4748
01:57:55,110 --> 01:57:57,580
you could see like it's a little
hands get sweaty and his pod,

4749
01:57:57,581 --> 01:57:58,680
he starts squirming,

4750
01:57:58,681 --> 01:58:00,630
gets him getting dumped on that.

4751
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:01,470
That makes,

4752
01:58:01,470 --> 01:58:03,060
that even makes me uncomfortable.

4753
01:58:04,830 --> 01:58:05,221
Yeah,

4754
01:58:05,221 --> 01:58:05,761
he's a,

4755
01:58:05,761 --> 01:58:06,960
he's not playing it clean.

4756
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:08,610
He's done some wild shit.

4757
01:58:08,710 --> 01:58:09,150
Yeah.

4758
01:58:09,150 --> 01:58:12,780
Literally I was say I was
doing a Jimmy Fallon show,

4759
01:58:13,310 --> 01:58:13,580
uh,

4760
01:58:13,580 --> 01:58:15,420
about a month ago and my friend,

4761
01:58:15,421 --> 01:58:15,631
you know,

4762
01:58:15,631 --> 01:58:18,240
some people have no tact and I love Jim,

4763
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:19,730
but you know,

4764
01:58:19,770 --> 01:58:21,480
nobody really wants to look like Jim.

4765
01:58:21,830 --> 01:58:21,981
Not,

4766
01:58:21,981 --> 01:58:22,111
you know,

4767
01:58:22,111 --> 01:58:23,610
not that they weren't so
looked like me either.

4768
01:58:24,090 --> 01:58:29,090
But she says to the guy who's a club club
owner of governors and brokerage where

4769
01:58:29,581 --> 01:58:30,310
I was playing,

4770
01:58:30,310 --> 01:58:30,530
you know,

4771
01:58:30,530 --> 01:58:33,240
you're out in the island cause
you look like Jim Norton.

4772
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:33,690
He goes,

4773
01:58:33,690 --> 01:58:33,841
no,

4774
01:58:33,841 --> 01:58:34,674
I know.

4775
01:58:35,130 --> 01:58:35,500
I go,

4776
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:35,791
she goes,

4777
01:58:35,791 --> 01:58:36,001
yeah,

4778
01:58:36,001 --> 01:58:36,331
you do.

4779
01:58:36,331 --> 01:58:38,460
You remind me him and I
go join and let it go.

4780
01:58:38,610 --> 01:58:39,443
Nobody wants it.

4781
01:58:39,450 --> 01:58:40,850
If you're going to say
he looked like somebody,

4782
01:58:40,890 --> 01:58:42,450
say you look like Tom Hanks or,

4783
01:58:42,630 --> 01:58:43,381
or not Tom Hanks,

4784
01:58:43,381 --> 01:58:44,340
Tom Cruise or whatever.

4785
01:58:44,610 --> 01:58:46,080
Somebody who's supposed
to be good looking.

4786
01:58:46,260 --> 01:58:47,430
You don't see Jim Norton.

4787
01:58:47,790 --> 01:58:49,130
You know how rude I know.

4788
01:58:49,131 --> 01:58:49,400
You know.

4789
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:50,720
I wouldn't want,

4790
01:58:50,730 --> 01:58:51,001
you know,

4791
01:58:51,001 --> 01:58:51,721
to somebody saying,

4792
01:58:51,721 --> 01:58:52,920
well you look like dot Merera.

4793
01:58:52,921 --> 01:58:54,090
You're a spitting image of him.

4794
01:58:54,630 --> 01:58:54,931
Nice.

4795
01:58:54,931 --> 01:58:55,591
A little puffy,

4796
01:58:55,591 --> 01:58:56,100
overweight.

4797
01:58:56,100 --> 01:58:56,521
I like that.

4798
01:58:56,521 --> 01:58:57,354
Look,

4799
01:58:58,200 --> 01:59:00,290
when you see those pictures
of you back in the day dot.

4800
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:02,130
Merera the video that we had on earlier,

4801
01:59:02,430 --> 01:59:04,050
does it make you want to
go hit that treadmill?

4802
01:59:05,070 --> 01:59:05,730
Yeah.

4803
01:59:05,730 --> 01:59:07,110
It doesn't mean there's Jim

4804
01:59:08,660 --> 01:59:09,960
that was a cover of one of his,

4805
01:59:10,410 --> 01:59:11,850
one of his cds I think,

4806
01:59:11,851 --> 01:59:12,510
or his book.

4807
01:59:12,510 --> 01:59:13,343
I think his book,

4808
01:59:15,030 --> 01:59:15,810
he's funny.

4809
01:59:15,810 --> 01:59:17,060
He's a juvenile jail.

4810
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:19,290
The problem is they have a
Deli platter right at the end.

4811
01:59:20,670 --> 01:59:21,503
I do.

4812
01:59:22,060 --> 01:59:22,880
You know what I do?

4813
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:23,910
I do exercise.

4814
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:24,210
Yes.

4815
01:59:24,210 --> 01:59:29,030
The thing when I go to like get
my annual treadmill tests and all,

4816
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:29,731
I'm fine.

4817
01:59:29,731 --> 01:59:30,780
I'm great in great shape.

4818
01:59:31,230 --> 01:59:33,180
It's just the eating and drinking so much,

4819
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:34,080
you know,

4820
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:34,913
and the hours,

4821
01:59:35,010 --> 01:59:36,330
the comedian lifestyle,

4822
01:59:36,331 --> 01:59:37,560
my friend too.

4823
01:59:37,561 --> 01:59:38,394
Happy.

4824
01:59:38,700 --> 01:59:38,881
Yeah.

4825
01:59:38,881 --> 01:59:40,770
What did Christopher Hitchens say when he,

4826
01:59:40,771 --> 01:59:40,980
uh,

4827
01:59:40,980 --> 01:59:42,080
he got cancer and died.

4828
01:59:42,090 --> 01:59:44,070
He said he burnt the candle at both ends.

4829
01:59:44,071 --> 01:59:44,660
But what a,

4830
01:59:44,660 --> 01:59:46,050
what a lovely glow it made.

4831
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:50,370
I don't burn it at both ends cause I,

4832
01:59:50,490 --> 01:59:51,570
I get plenty of rest,

4833
01:59:51,950 --> 01:59:52,783
so that's okay.

4834
01:59:53,370 --> 01:59:54,240
I'm not saying it's okay,

4835
01:59:54,241 --> 01:59:55,450
but it's better than not rest.

4836
01:59:55,451 --> 01:59:57,330
And to take care of your health at all.

4837
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:00,570
Do you like you would take
vitamins or do you eat healthy?

4838
02:00:00,630 --> 02:00:01,140
Yeah,

4839
02:00:01,140 --> 02:00:01,540
yeah,

4840
02:00:01,540 --> 02:00:02,030
yeah.

4841
02:00:02,030 --> 02:00:07,030
Do you know what we just read yesterday
that pizza was an antique carcinogen

4842
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:08,910
because the effect,

4843
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,500
I hope this is true,

4844
02:00:10,890 --> 02:00:15,890
the effect of the melted cheese on
cooked tomatoes with somehow like sofic

4845
02:00:17,651 --> 02:00:18,670
esophagus cancer,

4846
02:00:18,671 --> 02:00:21,780
it was like damn 50%
and a bunch of things.

4847
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:22,210
Uh,

4848
02:00:22,210 --> 02:00:22,560
you know,

4849
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:25,530
if you can find that it was great
cause it's like liberated us.

4850
02:00:25,860 --> 02:00:26,730
I know there's a,

4851
02:00:26,731 --> 02:00:26,881
a,

4852
02:00:26,881 --> 02:00:29,400
there's a nutrient and
cook tomatoes that uh,

4853
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:30,840
apparently only,

4854
02:00:30,910 --> 02:00:31,230
eh,

4855
02:00:31,230 --> 02:00:35,520
it's only in cook tomatoes
that it has a certain effect.

4856
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:38,370
Whereas it lycopene.

4857
02:00:38,580 --> 02:00:39,413
Yeah,

4858
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:40,301
you got a,

4859
02:00:40,301 --> 02:00:40,680
um,

4860
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:43,980
you have to cook it to get lycopene
and lycopene is how you turn into a

4861
02:00:43,981 --> 02:00:44,850
werewolf.

4862
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:46,433
Doesn't sound like it.

4863
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:47,600
Lichen Lycopene,

4864
02:00:47,690 --> 02:00:48,090
you hear me?

4865
02:00:48,090 --> 02:00:48,923
You follow me?

4866
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:50,040
Like lupus.

4867
02:00:52,830 --> 02:00:53,663
I Dunno.

4868
02:00:54,120 --> 02:00:55,350
I'm talking about werewolves down.

4869
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:55,710
Herrera.

4870
02:00:55,710 --> 02:00:58,140
Lycopene is a apparently,

4871
02:00:58,200 --> 02:00:59,033
um,

4872
02:00:59,610 --> 02:01:00,150
it's uh,

4873
02:01:00,150 --> 02:01:02,070
reduces the risk of breast,

4874
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:03,113
prostate,

4875
02:01:03,210 --> 02:01:04,800
colon and other cancers.

4876
02:01:04,980 --> 02:01:05,310
Hmm.

4877
02:01:05,310 --> 02:01:06,810
A powerful antioxidant.

4878
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:08,061
Pi Foot.

4879
02:01:08,061 --> 02:01:09,010
Christ swipe down.

4880
02:01:09,011 --> 02:01:09,920
He has lived so long,

4881
02:01:09,921 --> 02:01:10,341
by my way.

4882
02:01:10,341 --> 02:01:11,174
Am I right

4883
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:14,530
on that?

4884
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:16,270
A little gravy on this.

4885
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:17,300
Take some humble you.

4886
02:01:17,310 --> 02:01:18,890
I made gobbly guts field.

4887
02:01:19,130 --> 02:01:20,550
That's when you know they're legit.

4888
02:01:20,551 --> 02:01:21,720
When they call it gravy.

4889
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:23,520
My grandmother always called it gravy.

4890
02:01:23,550 --> 02:01:24,870
Get him some gravy.

4891
02:01:24,930 --> 02:01:25,960
Get degraded.

4892
02:01:26,060 --> 02:01:28,740
The only time we called the sauce was,

4893
02:01:28,741 --> 02:01:29,574
uh,

4894
02:01:29,990 --> 02:01:30,490
was like,

4895
02:01:30,490 --> 02:01:31,323
I'm

4896
02:01:32,580 --> 02:01:36,630
totally different thing like gravy
and also was like Turkey gravy.

4897
02:01:37,020 --> 02:01:37,331
You know,

4898
02:01:37,331 --> 02:01:37,971
that kind of it.

4899
02:01:37,971 --> 02:01:38,351
But great.

4900
02:01:38,351 --> 02:01:38,521
We were,

4901
02:01:38,521 --> 02:01:40,060
but red sauce was great.

4902
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:41,040
Yeah.

4903
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:42,030
It was never sauce.

4904
02:01:42,031 --> 02:01:44,340
You never called the red sauce
and you never had white sauce.

4905
02:01:44,341 --> 02:01:45,300
Get the fuck out of here.

4906
02:01:45,301 --> 02:01:45,631
With that.

4907
02:01:45,631 --> 02:01:46,710
What are you a Prima Donna?

4908
02:01:47,010 --> 02:01:47,481
What do you want to,

4909
02:01:47,481 --> 02:01:50,640
olive oil would call it a fucking massage.

4910
02:01:50,641 --> 02:01:50,821
You,

4911
02:01:50,821 --> 02:01:51,780
while you have that,

4912
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:52,891
you can get that.

4913
02:01:52,891 --> 02:01:54,390
Look at this sexy fish right here.

4914
02:01:54,391 --> 02:01:55,500
Jesus Christ.

4915
02:01:55,510 --> 02:01:56,610
Sexy bastard.

4916
02:01:56,730 --> 02:01:57,563
Look at you.

4917
02:01:59,470 --> 02:01:59,800
Look up.

4918
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:00,633
Kills who you are.

4919
02:02:01,290 --> 02:02:02,330
I said I love my cat.

4920
02:02:02,340 --> 02:02:03,980
You know those people
that always have to write.

4921
02:02:04,070 --> 02:02:04,690
All right.

4922
02:02:04,690 --> 02:02:08,390
[inaudible] material for great.

4923
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:10,750
Wait til I leave.

4924
02:02:11,390 --> 02:02:14,240
I'm great and you're being very
disrespectful to have a cat.

4925
02:02:14,241 --> 02:02:14,890
Do you?

4926
02:02:14,890 --> 02:02:15,760
Do you still love your cat?

4927
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:19,660
I'm not going to lead me into a bit.

4928
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:21,501
Well,

4929
02:02:21,501 --> 02:02:22,670
if you want to talk to Brian,

4930
02:02:22,671 --> 02:02:26,210
he will be at the American comedy
company tonight in San Diego.

4931
02:02:26,230 --> 02:02:26,960
Right?

4932
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:28,010
You feeling good for that trip?

4933
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:29,570
You feel better and I can
feel like I could drive.

4934
02:02:29,571 --> 02:02:32,120
Definitely stay there tonight though.

4935
02:02:32,150 --> 02:02:33,100
Make sure you stay over there.

4936
02:02:33,810 --> 02:02:35,360
Don't try to drive back tonight now.

4937
02:02:35,390 --> 02:02:36,223
Don't do that then.

4938
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:37,520
Good luck with the show.

4939
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:37,851
Thanks.

4940
02:02:37,851 --> 02:02:38,110
Fine.

4941
02:02:38,110 --> 02:02:38,720
And we are

4942
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:39,330
Tony Hinchcliffe.

4943
02:02:39,330 --> 02:02:42,170
Hassan's a fucking hilarious
up and coming standup comedian.

4944
02:02:42,171 --> 02:02:45,290
We've had him on a bunch of the
death squad shows at the Ice House.

4945
02:02:45,291 --> 02:02:46,130
He's hilarious.

4946
02:02:46,190 --> 02:02:47,270
Really good dude too.

4947
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:47,800
Sarah.

4948
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:49,960
Sianna also very funny also.

4949
02:02:49,961 --> 02:02:50,740
Very cool.

4950
02:02:50,740 --> 02:02:53,170
We've also had her on the
ice house chronicles as well,

4951
02:02:53,380 --> 02:02:56,710

02:03:03,661 --> 02:03:03,991
So,

4957
02:03:03,991 --> 02:03:04,231

4958
02:03:04,231 --> 02:03:05,430
that's an excellent show tonight.

4959
02:03:05,490 --> 02:03:06,121
San Diego,

4960
02:03:06,121 --> 02:03:07,410
San Diego is really a,

4961
02:03:07,411 --> 02:03:09,020
there's quite a few uh,

4962
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:09,630
comedy,

4963
02:03:09,630 --> 02:03:09,841
uh,

4964
02:03:09,841 --> 02:03:11,210
opportunities now.

4965
02:03:11,730 --> 02:03:12,960
There's two good clubs,

4966
02:03:12,990 --> 02:03:13,561
there's a,

4967
02:03:13,561 --> 02:03:15,360
the American comedy club and there's a,

4968
02:03:15,361 --> 02:03:16,530
an American comedy company.

4969
02:03:16,531 --> 02:03:17,400
And then there's Matt House.

4970
02:03:17,510 --> 02:03:19,190
My house I heard is awesome and you know,

4971
02:03:19,191 --> 02:03:19,830
I liked the little,

4972
02:03:19,830 --> 02:03:19,940
well,

4973
02:03:19,940 --> 02:03:21,080
and I did a theater though.

4974
02:03:21,081 --> 02:03:21,631
The comedy store.

4975
02:03:21,631 --> 02:03:22,050
Yeah.

4976
02:03:22,050 --> 02:03:23,190
I don't remember the theater's name,

4977
02:03:23,191 --> 02:03:24,210
but I did a theater there.

4978
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:25,193
Um,

4979
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:26,210
but it was whatever it was.

4980
02:03:26,211 --> 02:03:27,120
It was fucking awesome.

4981
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:29,100
They gas place beautiful.

4982
02:03:29,101 --> 02:03:30,600
So happy then they're fucking,

4983
02:03:30,601 --> 02:03:31,620
San Diego is great.

4984
02:03:31,621 --> 02:03:31,831
I mean,

4985
02:03:31,831 --> 02:03:34,940
it's a little weird because you're
right next to Mexico and uh,

4986
02:03:35,090 --> 02:03:35,400
um,

4987
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:38,520
you get a lot of people that come
over from Tijuana to watch the show.

4988
02:03:38,620 --> 02:03:38,990
Really that,

4989
02:03:38,990 --> 02:03:39,870
that was cool as fuck.

4990
02:03:39,871 --> 02:03:42,230
I met a lot of people from Tijuana
and they would tell me like,

4991
02:03:42,231 --> 02:03:43,260
where we're taking pictures together.

4992
02:03:43,261 --> 02:03:43,770
Hey man,

4993
02:03:43,770 --> 02:03:44,610
we came from Tijuana.

4994
02:03:44,611 --> 02:03:45,030
I'm like,

4995
02:03:45,030 --> 02:03:45,331
Damn,

4996
02:03:45,331 --> 02:03:46,200
you could just come over.

4997
02:03:46,590 --> 02:03:48,870
Like I was under the impression
that it was like really difficult.

4998
02:03:48,871 --> 02:03:53,190
You couldn't just like go out for a
night in San Diego if you live in Tiawana

4999
02:03:53,191 --> 02:03:54,810
like they wouldn't let you
because they would think,

5000
02:03:54,811 --> 02:03:55,950
why would you come back?

5001
02:03:56,320 --> 02:03:56,820
You know?

5002
02:03:56,820 --> 02:03:57,600
But no,

5003
02:03:57,600 --> 02:03:58,380
these dudes,

5004
02:03:58,380 --> 02:03:59,520
they were like legit.

5005
02:03:59,521 --> 02:04:02,700
They had passports the whole deal
and then they win a that's cool.

5006
02:04:02,730 --> 02:04:03,340
Yeah.

5007
02:04:03,340 --> 02:04:04,530
[inaudible] guys are coming at night.

5008
02:04:05,310 --> 02:04:05,860
The radio,

5009
02:04:05,860 --> 02:04:07,150
that was the Balboa theatre.

5010
02:04:07,151 --> 02:04:08,080
It was pretty awesome.

5011
02:04:08,260 --> 02:04:08,561
But yeah,

5012
02:04:08,561 --> 02:04:09,041
you can.

5013
02:04:09,041 --> 02:04:09,370
Uh,

5014
02:04:09,370 --> 02:04:10,340
did he get Viagara here?

5015
02:04:11,890 --> 02:04:13,220
You don't want that Mexican for too.

5016
02:04:13,270 --> 02:04:14,110
It might not be real.

5017
02:04:14,540 --> 02:04:16,390
I got bill burr on the
show tomorrow night.

5018
02:04:19,540 --> 02:04:23,950
It's a busting balls with Dom Herrera
at the laugh factory had a clock.

5019
02:04:24,130 --> 02:04:28,090
And so this is your show that people are
allowed to come in and they're allowed

5020
02:04:28,091 --> 02:04:31,800
to like yell out and say
things and what times of start?

5021
02:04:32,050 --> 02:04:34,420
Eight o'clock to eight
o'clock and it's bill.

5022
02:04:34,510 --> 02:04:35,343
Who else?

5023
02:04:35,860 --> 02:04:37,000
I Dunno who else on the show.

5024
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:38,370
I just want to make sure I nail the bill.

5025
02:04:38,550 --> 02:04:38,910
Oh,

5026
02:04:38,910 --> 02:04:39,570
okay.

5027
02:04:39,570 --> 02:04:41,280
Because that sounds
like it'd be really fun.

5028
02:04:41,310 --> 02:04:42,030
That's tomorrow night.

5029
02:04:42,030 --> 02:04:42,863
Thursday night.

5030
02:04:42,980 --> 02:04:44,660
Well am I go by and watch that as a,

5031
02:04:44,700 --> 02:04:45,481
as a spectator,

5032
02:04:45,481 --> 02:04:46,740
if you want to say we don't want to spot,

5033
02:04:46,741 --> 02:04:46,921
you know,

5034
02:04:46,921 --> 02:04:47,620
it's open to you.

5035
02:04:47,620 --> 02:04:48,670
I need to start hanging out there.

5036
02:04:48,671 --> 02:04:50,020
It seems like everyone
is hanging out there now.

5037
02:04:50,080 --> 02:04:51,310
Well we went there last night.

5038
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:52,280
Last night was great.

5039
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:55,070
We can definitely make
that place do better.

5040
02:04:55,220 --> 02:04:55,820
And he was like,

5041
02:04:55,820 --> 02:04:57,290
you need a lot,

5042
02:04:57,350 --> 02:04:57,711
you know,

5043
02:04:57,711 --> 02:04:58,820
like the crowds are small.

5044
02:04:58,900 --> 02:05:00,300
Like for the sunset strip.

5045
02:05:00,301 --> 02:05:01,670
I mean we'd be packed the Ice House.

5046
02:05:01,700 --> 02:05:01,930
Yeah.

5047
02:05:01,930 --> 02:05:02,230
And that's,

5048
02:05:02,230 --> 02:05:02,691
I don't know,

5049
02:05:02,691 --> 02:05:03,760
the fuck got Pasadena.

5050
02:05:03,780 --> 02:05:04,401
They had been,

5051
02:05:04,401 --> 02:05:04,581
no,

5052
02:05:04,581 --> 02:05:06,650
you were going to be on at five o'clock.

5053
02:05:06,651 --> 02:05:07,221
That's what I'm saying.

5054
02:05:07,221 --> 02:05:07,981
Like we could have a,

5055
02:05:07,981 --> 02:05:09,020
we could have promoted that.

5056
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:09,780
Yeah.

5057
02:05:09,780 --> 02:05:11,480
Tiffany Henderson is
always there and she's,

5058
02:05:11,481 --> 02:05:11,961
and she's,

5059
02:05:11,961 --> 02:05:12,111
you know,

5060
02:05:12,111 --> 02:05:17,111
she's one of the only people that went
through that camp that I still call me,

5061
02:05:17,450 --> 02:05:17,630
man.

5062
02:05:17,630 --> 02:05:18,440
She was hot then.

5063
02:05:18,440 --> 02:05:18,531
Oh,

5064
02:05:18,531 --> 02:05:19,131
that's hilarious.

5065
02:05:19,131 --> 02:05:19,700
Yeah.

5066
02:05:19,700 --> 02:05:20,031
Well,

5067
02:05:20,031 --> 02:05:22,130
it's a great club effect is great.

5068
02:05:22,131 --> 02:05:23,600
If we get another date,

5069
02:05:23,601 --> 02:05:23,961
Jamie,

5070
02:05:23,961 --> 02:05:28,160
so he can't talk to us anymore to figure
out a way we got to do my podcast with

5071
02:05:28,161 --> 02:05:28,650
just me.

5072
02:05:28,650 --> 02:05:29,060
Yes.

5073
02:05:29,060 --> 02:05:29,720
Yes we do.

5074
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:29,991
Yeah,

5075
02:05:29,991 --> 02:05:30,500
please.

5076
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:30,820
Yeah.

5077
02:05:30,820 --> 02:05:31,970
What we're doing next week.

5078
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:32,840
Last week,

5079
02:05:32,840 --> 02:05:34,280
I got a couple of days off next week.

5080
02:05:34,580 --> 02:05:35,840
Next week's the end of the world tour.

5081
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:37,430
It's only one day.

5082
02:05:37,430 --> 02:05:38,263
It's not really a tour.

5083
02:05:38,270 --> 02:05:40,910
That's the end of the world
show with a mad flavor.

5084
02:05:40,911 --> 02:05:42,650
Aka Planet Rock,

5085
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:47,680
Aka Joey Diaz and Doug Stan hope
and great show honey honey band.

5086
02:05:48,620 --> 02:05:49,910
We're going to have them on the podcast.

5087
02:05:49,911 --> 02:05:50,511
Next money honey.

5088
02:05:50,511 --> 02:05:50,970
Honey,

5089
02:05:50,970 --> 02:05:51,160
honey,

5090
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:51,710
honey band.

5091
02:05:51,710 --> 02:05:53,810
They will be here or ice house.

5092
02:05:53,811 --> 02:05:54,770
Probably do it at his house.

5093
02:05:54,850 --> 02:05:55,220
His house.

5094
02:05:55,220 --> 02:05:57,290
We'll do it at the ice house
cause we got the good Internet.

5095
02:05:57,670 --> 02:05:58,100
Um,

5096
02:05:58,100 --> 02:05:59,000
you ever do Tampa?

5097
02:05:59,300 --> 02:05:59,631
Yes.

5098
02:05:59,631 --> 02:05:59,871
Yes.

5099
02:05:59,871 --> 02:06:00,704
I've done Tampa.

5100
02:06:00,950 --> 02:06:01,783
Bobby jewels.

5101
02:06:02,060 --> 02:06:02,691
I did know,

5102
02:06:02,691 --> 02:06:03,800
I did all the Improv,

5103
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:06,470
the improvement side splitters.

5104
02:06:06,530 --> 02:06:07,520
My folks used to live out there.

5105
02:06:07,521 --> 02:06:11,030
They still live in Clearwater where
all the scientists Scientologists are.

5106
02:06:11,690 --> 02:06:12,770
That's where the Phillies train.

5107
02:06:13,340 --> 02:06:13,941
If it matters,

5108
02:06:13,941 --> 02:06:15,200
maybe they're Scientologists too.

5109
02:06:15,290 --> 02:06:16,280
Maybe that's why they do so well.

5110
02:06:16,310 --> 02:06:19,730
I'm doing that in January
with his Knoxville club,

5111
02:06:19,731 --> 02:06:24,110
which is funny because I can't draw a
fucking person in Nashville and Knoxville.

5112
02:06:24,111 --> 02:06:25,220
He sold out Nashville.

5113
02:06:25,250 --> 02:06:26,083
Tricky.

5114
02:06:26,210 --> 02:06:27,670
Why would I sell that Knoxville?

5115
02:06:27,930 --> 02:06:31,280
But Nashville is a particularly
tricky apparently for comedy.

5116
02:06:31,420 --> 02:06:31,830
Yeah.

5117
02:06:31,830 --> 02:06:32,663
I don't know why.

5118
02:06:32,890 --> 02:06:33,080
Yeah,

5119
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:33,231
this,

5120
02:06:33,231 --> 02:06:33,451
this,

5121
02:06:33,451 --> 02:06:34,580
there are cities where it's tough.

5122
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:35,120
You know,

5123
02:06:35,120 --> 02:06:35,301
it's,

5124
02:06:35,301 --> 02:06:36,140
it's hard to,

5125
02:06:36,260 --> 02:06:36,471
you know,

5126
02:06:36,471 --> 02:06:36,821
they don't have,

5127
02:06:36,821 --> 02:06:39,710
they don't have a comedy community and
it seems like it wouldn't really make

5128
02:06:39,711 --> 02:06:40,310
sense.

5129
02:06:40,310 --> 02:06:40,501
I mean,

5130
02:06:40,501 --> 02:06:40,791
he gets,

5131
02:06:40,791 --> 02:06:42,630
it doesn't feel like it held up on music.

5132
02:06:42,631 --> 02:06:42,890
You know?

5133
02:06:42,890 --> 02:06:43,940
It's such a music town.

5134
02:06:43,941 --> 02:06:44,160
I get,

5135
02:06:44,160 --> 02:06:44,380
I mean,

5136
02:06:44,380 --> 02:06:47,160
if you're like a really big name
at southern that they like you,

5137
02:06:47,180 --> 02:06:48,350
they like the southern accent.

5138
02:06:48,351 --> 02:06:48,471
Yeah.

5139
02:06:48,471 --> 02:06:49,340
And guys like Louie,

5140
02:06:49,740 --> 02:06:51,400
who's like a example of a southern act.

5141
02:06:51,401 --> 02:06:52,400
It's like Rodney Carrington,

5142
02:06:52,580 --> 02:06:53,330
Jeff Fox,

5143
02:06:53,330 --> 02:06:54,230
where Jeff Fox goes,

5144
02:06:54,231 --> 02:06:54,980
guys.

5145
02:06:54,980 --> 02:06:56,150
Larry the cable guy or to Kevin.

5146
02:06:56,151 --> 02:06:56,961
He's a white crosses,

5147
02:06:56,961 --> 02:06:57,720
a lot of lines.

5148
02:06:57,720 --> 02:06:59,840
It then the Larry the cable guy.

5149
02:06:59,870 --> 02:07:00,111
Oh yeah.

5150
02:07:00,111 --> 02:07:01,280
They love him up in Michigan.

5151
02:07:01,281 --> 02:07:03,040
And because he's so blue collar,

5152
02:07:03,050 --> 02:07:03,261
you know,

5153
02:07:03,261 --> 02:07:03,870
it's so funny.

5154
02:07:03,870 --> 02:07:05,660
If he doesn't talk like
that at all at all.

5155
02:07:05,790 --> 02:07:08,930
And I love him and it's like if some
people have gotten insulted because he

5156
02:07:08,931 --> 02:07:09,764
doesn't talk like that,

5157
02:07:10,210 --> 02:07:12,050
I you will lead me on bar,

5158
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:14,190
Sir.

5159
02:07:14,190 --> 02:07:15,450
I'm just here to make some money.

5160
02:07:16,050 --> 02:07:16,291
Yeah.

5161
02:07:16,291 --> 02:07:17,041
He uh,

5162
02:07:17,041 --> 02:07:19,150
I met him at a Montreal
comedy festival way,

5163
02:07:19,160 --> 02:07:20,370
way back in the day.

5164
02:07:20,540 --> 02:07:21,030
Yeah.

5165
02:07:21,030 --> 02:07:21,661
Really Nice Guy,

5166
02:07:21,661 --> 02:07:22,050
man.

5167
02:07:22,050 --> 02:07:22,551
Him and Todd,

5168
02:07:22,551 --> 02:07:25,700
she used to hanging out at the West
Palm Club coach called comedy corner and

5169
02:07:25,701 --> 02:07:27,120
that's where we got to
know those two guys.

5170
02:07:27,121 --> 02:07:27,840
And then,

5171
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:28,740
do you know Josh Wolfe?

5172
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:30,833
I don't.

5173
02:07:30,980 --> 02:07:32,520
Josh Wolfe is a open for Larry,

5174
02:07:32,521 --> 02:07:34,260
the cable guy and he was
showing me photos of it,

5175
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:36,250
of being in football

5176
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:36,790
arena.

5177
02:07:36,790 --> 02:07:37,620
Oh my God.

5178
02:07:37,620 --> 02:07:39,700
It's like 50,000 people to see Larry.

5179
02:07:39,850 --> 02:07:40,900
He knew it was so funny.

5180
02:07:40,901 --> 02:07:41,530
He was.

5181
02:07:41,530 --> 02:07:41,980
He was,

5182
02:07:41,980 --> 02:07:44,290
he was such a normal act as himself.

5183
02:07:44,350 --> 02:07:44,770
Yeah.

5184
02:07:44,770 --> 02:07:45,790
He wasn't bad,

5185
02:07:45,830 --> 02:07:47,860
but it wasn't good as Larry the cable guy,

5186
02:07:47,861 --> 02:07:49,240
he looked into something brilliant.

5187
02:07:49,290 --> 02:07:49,611
Yeah.

5188
02:07:49,611 --> 02:07:50,444
And he's great at it.

5189
02:07:50,470 --> 02:07:51,010
He's great.

5190
02:07:51,010 --> 02:07:52,240
He's so fucking badly.

5191
02:07:52,870 --> 02:07:54,010
He found that character

5192
02:07:55,870 --> 02:07:57,970
muscle fitness with Joe Piscopo on.

5193
02:07:57,971 --> 02:08:01,510
It looks like his head is
in planted on a muscle,

5194
02:08:01,511 --> 02:08:02,081
men's body.

5195
02:08:02,081 --> 02:08:05,440
It doesn't look right while he's
in fucking killer shape back then,

5196
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:06,600
he's probably Royden.

5197
02:08:06,940 --> 02:08:07,420
Oh yeah.

5198
02:08:07,420 --> 02:08:08,510
Joe Piscopo.

5199
02:08:09,250 --> 02:08:13,480
Johnny dangerously girls like trying to
take him down and he's holding onto her

5200
02:08:13,481 --> 02:08:13,751
hand.

5201
02:08:13,751 --> 02:08:15,190
What kind of a fucking w what?

5202
02:08:15,210 --> 02:08:16,210
What does that statement,

5203
02:08:16,211 --> 02:08:17,440
why is she behind him?

5204
02:08:17,950 --> 02:08:19,330
She should be holding
them in front of them.

5205
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:20,890
It looks like they Photoshop the cock out.

5206
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:21,730
It's a weird thing.

5207
02:08:21,730 --> 02:08:23,280
It's always a smooth over his deck.

5208
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:24,310
Those were darker days.

5209
02:08:25,180 --> 02:08:26,780
People didn't have as
many Cox in their life.

5210
02:08:27,650 --> 02:08:28,800
Anybody who was on the Internet.

5211
02:08:28,810 --> 02:08:29,700
That's my golden rule.

5212
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:30,190
The Internet.

5213
02:08:30,190 --> 02:08:32,020
If you have a photo on
the Internet somewhere,

5214
02:08:32,021 --> 02:08:33,820
someone has Photoshop
to dick in your mouth.

5215
02:08:33,850 --> 02:08:36,340
It's just the fact there's
no getting around that.

5216
02:08:36,341 --> 02:08:37,630
I think that's better for everybody.

5217
02:08:38,700 --> 02:08:39,610
I was watching this show.

5218
02:08:39,611 --> 02:08:40,180
There was talking.

5219
02:08:40,180 --> 02:08:43,120
It was that you ever watch that Morgan
Freeman show through the wormhole?

5220
02:08:43,570 --> 02:08:43,930
No.

5221
02:08:43,930 --> 02:08:44,763
He narrates it.

5222
02:08:44,770 --> 02:08:45,603
Oh yes.

5223
02:08:45,610 --> 02:08:47,650
It's like a Cya discovery or one of those.

5224
02:08:47,680 --> 02:08:48,160
Yeah,

5225
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:48,710
it blows.

5226
02:08:48,710 --> 02:08:51,700
It's mind blowing if you
haven't DVR did folks,

5227
02:08:51,701 --> 02:08:52,960
it's a must DVR.

5228
02:08:53,170 --> 02:08:53,980
Especially when you,

5229
02:08:53,980 --> 02:08:54,311
you know,

5230
02:08:54,311 --> 02:08:57,040
like if you're looking for something
really freaky to watch two o'clock in the

5231
02:08:57,041 --> 02:09:02,041
morning and they were talking about the
fact that just by virtue of the laws of

5232
02:09:02,981 --> 02:09:04,570
probability this,

5233
02:09:04,571 --> 02:09:05,010
uh,

5234
02:09:05,010 --> 02:09:06,430
I think that's what they were citing.

5235
02:09:06,460 --> 02:09:11,290
That because of the fact that the universe
may be infinite and what that means

5236
02:09:11,291 --> 02:09:11,790
is that,

5237
02:09:11,790 --> 02:09:12,100
you know,

5238
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:12,661
we have a,

5239
02:09:12,661 --> 02:09:16,360
an idea that the universe is like
14 billion years old and it started,

5240
02:09:16,570 --> 02:09:17,590
there's a lot of people,

5241
02:09:17,591 --> 02:09:21,010
a lot of these physicists that actually
think that instead of it being finite,

5242
02:09:21,011 --> 02:09:22,980
like you can measure the
distance of the Internet,

5243
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:24,100
that it might be infinite.

5244
02:09:24,280 --> 02:09:24,890
And if it is,

5245
02:09:24,890 --> 02:09:26,260
and I have no idea,

5246
02:09:26,261 --> 02:09:27,130
I don't understand any of it.

5247
02:09:27,160 --> 02:09:29,440
I don't understand how it
can be 14 billion years old.

5248
02:09:29,560 --> 02:09:31,870
I don't understand how
it could have 14 billion.

5249
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:35,500
I don't understand how it could
have not existed in an existed.

5250
02:09:35,501 --> 02:09:36,550
I really don't understand it.

5251
02:09:36,670 --> 02:09:39,940
But what I do know is that what this guy
was saying was that if the universe is

5252
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:40,630
infinite,

5253
02:09:40,630 --> 02:09:45,630
that means there's not just one but
several versions of you exactly out there

5254
02:09:47,020 --> 02:09:49,690
just because of the laws of that.

5255
02:09:49,690 --> 02:09:51,970
The fact that there's so many variables,

5256
02:09:52,210 --> 02:09:54,180
it's like it's like a they,

5257
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:56,950
what they showed is they showed
this giant pattern of rocks,

5258
02:09:56,951 --> 02:10:01,840
like this huge pile of rocks and they
were showing that if you get a like this,

5259
02:10:01,841 --> 02:10:03,430
there's like one blue rock,

5260
02:10:03,431 --> 02:10:04,300
one white rock,

5261
02:10:04,301 --> 02:10:05,170
one black rock,

5262
02:10:05,290 --> 02:10:10,060
like in this order right next to each
other in this massive pile of rocks,

5263
02:10:10,061 --> 02:10:12,400
you're going to have this
occur x amount of times.

5264
02:10:12,401 --> 02:10:13,330
It's just inevitable.

5265
02:10:13,331 --> 02:10:14,164
It just will occur.

5266
02:10:14,170 --> 02:10:17,950
And he walks around and he picks it
out and then they were starting to talk

5267
02:10:17,951 --> 02:10:18,601
about the,

5268
02:10:18,601 --> 02:10:22,090
the distance of infinity and
the idea of the infinite.

5269
02:10:22,120 --> 02:10:24,130
And the idea that if that is the case,

5270
02:10:24,540 --> 02:10:29,540
there is so many possibilities
that every like one,

5271
02:10:30,070 --> 02:10:30,610
you know,

5272
02:10:30,610 --> 02:10:32,690
x amount of trillion light years,

5273
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:34,340
there will be another

5274
02:10:34,340 --> 02:10:34,611
dom.

5275
02:10:34,611 --> 02:10:35,001
Irrera.

5276
02:10:35,001 --> 02:10:35,834
Exactly.

5277
02:10:36,650 --> 02:10:36,801
Well,

5278
02:10:36,801 --> 02:10:37,730
I hope you lost weight.

5279
02:10:38,840 --> 02:10:39,201
You know what,

5280
02:10:39,201 --> 02:10:40,034
I could just stop.

5281
02:10:40,150 --> 02:10:40,611
You know what?

5282
02:10:40,611 --> 02:10:43,520
I can't fathom 186,000 miles a second.

5283
02:10:43,550 --> 02:10:44,840
I believe the speed of light is,

5284
02:10:45,260 --> 02:10:48,220
and they say light years and then
they say a trillion light years.

5285
02:10:48,470 --> 02:10:49,660
That's fucking unfathomed.

5286
02:10:49,670 --> 02:10:51,480
I think it was several
trillion light years.

5287
02:10:51,490 --> 02:10:51,670
It was,

5288
02:10:51,670 --> 02:10:52,071
I mean,

5289
02:10:52,071 --> 02:10:54,350
hundred million light years
or something like that.

5290
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:54,700
Uh,

5291
02:10:54,700 --> 02:10:55,533
I can't,

5292
02:10:55,850 --> 02:10:56,780
my mind can't.

5293
02:10:57,220 --> 02:10:59,660
We can't 93 million miles as a son.

5294
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:00,590
I can understand that.

5295
02:11:00,620 --> 02:11:01,311
93 million.

5296
02:11:01,311 --> 02:11:02,144
I can deal with that.

5297
02:11:02,460 --> 02:11:02,910
You know,

5298
02:11:02,910 --> 02:11:05,390
the Earth is 24,000
miles around 93 million.

5299
02:11:05,391 --> 02:11:05,661
All right.

5300
02:11:05,661 --> 02:11:06,080
The Sun,

5301
02:11:06,080 --> 02:11:07,710
but fucking trillion light years.

5302
02:11:07,830 --> 02:11:07,921
Well,

5303
02:11:07,921 --> 02:11:09,020
what's really fucked up,

5304
02:11:09,030 --> 02:11:09,320
Homie,

5305
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:12,270
me universe is that if the
WWE universe is infinite,

5306
02:11:12,271 --> 02:11:14,530
when you get to 1 trillion light years,

5307
02:11:14,700 --> 02:11:19,130
you're not even like
1000000th of 1% done here.

5308
02:11:19,330 --> 02:11:20,880
Like it never ends.

5309
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:22,230
So it doesn't matter.

5310
02:11:22,231 --> 02:11:22,710
It's like,

5311
02:11:22,710 --> 02:11:24,480
it will go on literally forever.

5312
02:11:24,510 --> 02:11:25,680
So how can we get cocky?

5313
02:11:25,950 --> 02:11:26,310
I don't know.

5314
02:11:26,310 --> 02:11:27,143
How could we help people?

5315
02:11:27,870 --> 02:11:28,231
I think,

5316
02:11:28,231 --> 02:11:30,240
you know what's helped
people get cocky cities,

5317
02:11:30,630 --> 02:11:31,470
I think lights,

5318
02:11:31,730 --> 02:11:32,130
you know,

5319
02:11:32,130 --> 02:11:33,060
like light pollution,

5320
02:11:33,750 --> 02:11:34,450
security.

5321
02:11:34,450 --> 02:11:35,283
Yeah.

5322
02:11:35,310 --> 02:11:36,870
I think those old cave men,

5323
02:11:36,871 --> 02:11:41,871
people like they had a great reverence
to the sky because like at nighttime the

5324
02:11:42,031 --> 02:11:43,140
shit was overwhelming.

5325
02:11:43,470 --> 02:11:47,910
Like you would have Sunday time and then
at nighttime they were had to be nights

5326
02:11:47,940 --> 02:11:49,860
back when there was no
pollution whatsoever.

5327
02:11:49,950 --> 02:11:53,360
Especially high altitude people where
they must've just seen have low.

5328
02:11:53,370 --> 02:11:53,640
Yeah,

5329
02:11:53,640 --> 02:11:54,810
it's got to be lit up.

5330
02:11:54,840 --> 02:11:55,560
Everything.

5331
02:11:55,560 --> 02:11:56,131
So the,

5332
02:11:56,131 --> 02:11:59,820
the reverence that they must've had
for their journey on this biological

5333
02:11:59,821 --> 02:12:00,420
spaceship,

5334
02:12:00,420 --> 02:12:03,330
this organic spaceship
hurling through the galaxy.

5335
02:12:03,510 --> 02:12:05,700
I mean it must've been
far greater than ours now.

5336
02:12:05,790 --> 02:12:10,560
So like as we develop more and more
technology that allows us to do more and

5337
02:12:10,561 --> 02:12:14,580
more things that make us almost superhuman
in our abilities as far as like our

5338
02:12:14,581 --> 02:12:15,220
ability to,

5339
02:12:15,220 --> 02:12:18,660
to send information and receive
information and get questions answered,

5340
02:12:18,661 --> 02:12:19,494
learn things,

5341
02:12:19,590 --> 02:12:20,730
transmit data,

5342
02:12:20,731 --> 02:12:21,810
photos and videos.

5343
02:12:21,811 --> 02:12:23,670
It's like unprecedented.

5344
02:12:23,860 --> 02:12:27,300
Like it's nothing has ever
even been close to this before.

5345
02:12:28,140 --> 02:12:29,010
And when you see that,

5346
02:12:29,011 --> 02:12:31,230
like it really makes you wonder,

5347
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:33,690
it really makes you wonder.

5348
02:12:33,780 --> 02:12:36,840
It really makes you wonder if like while
we're doing that and then while we're

5349
02:12:36,841 --> 02:12:40,020
blocking out all this sun with all
this light and you get all this light

5350
02:12:40,021 --> 02:12:43,110
pollution and then we have all this
actual pollution where we don't see the

5351
02:12:43,111 --> 02:12:43,944
mountains.

5352
02:12:44,130 --> 02:12:46,530
You know that weird feeling that you
get in la where you can't see the

5353
02:12:46,531 --> 02:12:46,860
mountains.

5354
02:12:46,860 --> 02:12:50,780
Then one day it rains and all of a sudden
you see fucking mountains everywhere

5355
02:12:50,820 --> 02:12:53,760
coming down such that there's a
snow cap mountain and you're like,

5356
02:12:53,761 --> 02:12:54,720
wait a minute,

5357
02:12:54,721 --> 02:12:57,180
what the fuck put that up.

5358
02:12:57,210 --> 02:13:01,980
But it's like think about that the the
areas where human beings are at their

5359
02:13:01,981 --> 02:13:02,610
biggest,

5360
02:13:02,610 --> 02:13:04,730
the areas where they're at
their most overpopulated,

5361
02:13:04,731 --> 02:13:08,220
that's you also at your most
disconnected from nature.

5362
02:13:08,370 --> 02:13:11,670
You're most disconnected from the view
of space because of the light pollution

5363
02:13:11,790 --> 02:13:15,210
you most disconnected from the view of
the mountains because of the pollution.

5364
02:13:15,330 --> 02:13:20,330
It's really fascinating cause that that
sort of mindset comes out of the lack of

5365
02:13:21,151 --> 02:13:22,110
reverence for nature.

5366
02:13:22,111 --> 02:13:23,910
The Moron mindset of the city.

5367
02:13:24,240 --> 02:13:25,180
Like that's like the,

5368
02:13:25,181 --> 02:13:28,590
the lack of respect for the fact
that this amazing deal with nature.

5369
02:13:28,650 --> 02:13:29,520
Crazy because it all,

5370
02:13:29,521 --> 02:13:32,730
it all happens in this
big and it's easy to do.

5371
02:13:32,730 --> 02:13:35,400
Like if you live in Manhattan and you
take the subway to work and you fucking

5372
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:37,920
buy your food at this grocery store
on the block and your apartments,

5373
02:13:37,921 --> 02:13:38,754
I looked up,

5374
02:13:38,790 --> 02:13:39,330
why bother?

5375
02:13:39,330 --> 02:13:41,190
What do you give a fuck
if food's there you go,

5376
02:13:41,191 --> 02:13:41,701
you pay it,

5377
02:13:41,701 --> 02:13:42,361
you go to your job,

5378
02:13:42,361 --> 02:13:42,901
you get your money,

5379
02:13:42,901 --> 02:13:43,734
you pay for your groceries.

5380
02:13:43,890 --> 02:13:45,800
Why even pay attention to
where it's being farmed?

5381
02:13:45,810 --> 02:13:46,230
Weight.

5382
02:13:46,230 --> 02:13:48,090
Even paying attention to pesticides,

5383
02:13:48,091 --> 02:13:48,371
agenda.

5384
02:13:48,371 --> 02:13:52,140
They can genetically modified foods or
who has to go to war to control what part

5385
02:13:52,141 --> 02:13:52,830
of the world?

5386
02:13:52,830 --> 02:13:53,011
Why?

5387
02:13:53,011 --> 02:13:53,844
Why give a fuck?

5388
02:13:53,860 --> 02:13:55,410
That's the weird sort of an arrogance.

5389
02:13:55,411 --> 02:13:57,600
It develops and some
place where you don't,

5390
02:13:57,830 --> 02:13:58,041
you,

5391
02:13:58,041 --> 02:13:59,430
you're not connected to it.

5392
02:13:59,431 --> 02:13:59,911
It's like we're,

5393
02:13:59,911 --> 02:14:04,410
we're developing things in these cities
where we're escaping the connection of

5394
02:14:04,411 --> 02:14:06,360
nature and like creating it ourselves.

5395
02:14:06,720 --> 02:14:07,500
You know,

5396
02:14:07,500 --> 02:14:11,520
people that have those indoor greenhouses
and shit cause something bad ass about

5397
02:14:11,521 --> 02:14:11,590
it.

5398
02:14:11,590 --> 02:14:13,230
But it's something crazy like why you,

5399
02:14:13,290 --> 02:14:16,990
why you got all this food and under
lamps and stuff and like in a,

5400
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:18,120
in a basement,

5401
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:18,751
you know,

5402
02:14:18,751 --> 02:14:19,380
like that's,

5403
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:21,990
I have a friend who would grow
vegetables in his basement.

5404
02:14:22,370 --> 02:14:22,561
I'm like,

5405
02:14:22,561 --> 02:14:23,610
what's wrong with the dirt?

5406
02:14:24,990 --> 02:14:26,160
But you should the dirt.

5407
02:14:26,161 --> 02:14:27,020
What are you do it?

5408
02:14:28,100 --> 02:14:28,251
Well,

5409
02:14:28,251 --> 02:14:29,840
some of it is this because
they can't connect.

5410
02:14:29,890 --> 02:14:30,723
They can't

5411
02:14:32,100 --> 02:14:33,290
raise things in the winter.

5412
02:14:33,350 --> 02:14:34,280
That kind of Oh yeah,

5413
02:14:34,281 --> 02:14:34,521
yeah,

5414
02:14:34,521 --> 02:14:34,701
yeah.

5415
02:14:34,701 --> 02:14:35,534
Oh definitely.

5416
02:14:35,890 --> 02:14:36,723
Yeah.

5417
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:39,470
But agriculture to me and
you and kill the climate.

5418
02:14:40,070 --> 02:14:40,311
Yeah.

5419
02:14:40,311 --> 02:14:41,270
One day I watched those,

5420
02:14:41,271 --> 02:14:41,600
uh,

5421
02:14:41,600 --> 02:14:45,890
those Alaska shows where people are like
preserving all their food and getting

5422
02:14:45,891 --> 02:14:46,381
ready for the,

5423
02:14:46,381 --> 02:14:49,040
the cold to put the
fucking crazy in there.

5424
02:14:49,430 --> 02:14:50,390
How did those guys,

5425
02:14:50,391 --> 02:14:51,380
the Eskimos and all,

5426
02:14:51,430 --> 02:14:51,600
why,

5427
02:14:51,600 --> 02:14:52,610
why would you ask him?

5428
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:54,260
Why would you stop there?

5429
02:14:55,010 --> 02:14:55,390
The end,

5430
02:14:55,390 --> 02:14:55,761
do it.

5431
02:14:55,761 --> 02:14:57,380
Whoever the do it,

5432
02:14:57,830 --> 02:14:59,110
what do they call it?

5433
02:14:59,570 --> 02:15:00,920
I'm not the idiot.

5434
02:15:00,950 --> 02:15:01,161
Well,

5435
02:15:01,161 --> 02:15:02,600
where it came from was,

5436
02:15:02,660 --> 02:15:03,410
um,

5437
02:15:03,410 --> 02:15:05,450
the people that came
down the Bering strait,

5438
02:15:05,510 --> 02:15:06,590
the same people that,

5439
02:15:06,740 --> 02:15:07,280
uh,

5440
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:10,310
that populated North America
before the Europeans,

5441
02:15:10,640 --> 02:15:11,473
they walked.

5442
02:15:11,570 --> 02:15:11,751
Yeah.

5443
02:15:11,751 --> 02:15:12,561
But when you start,

5444
02:15:12,561 --> 02:15:14,420
when you keep walking until
you got a little warmer.

5445
02:15:14,470 --> 02:15:14,810
Yeah,

5446
02:15:14,810 --> 02:15:15,531
I would say so.

5447
02:15:15,531 --> 02:15:16,341
But you know,

5448
02:15:16,341 --> 02:15:18,920
they might've found like a good
check that doesn't mind the cold.

5449
02:15:18,921 --> 02:15:19,940
And they started fucking,

5450
02:15:19,980 --> 02:15:22,580
they had some kids and they couldn't
move to the kid got older and they said,

5451
02:15:22,581 --> 02:15:22,851
listen,

5452
02:15:22,851 --> 02:15:23,900
I know how to catch seal.

5453
02:15:23,901 --> 02:15:24,770
It's just stay here.

5454
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:25,401
Yeah,

5455
02:15:25,401 --> 02:15:26,960
we got to make fires every night.

5456
02:15:26,961 --> 02:15:27,351
But so why?

5457
02:15:27,351 --> 02:15:29,750
We'll make a fire rather
than make it glues.

5458
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:30,673
It's beautiful.

5459
02:15:31,340 --> 02:15:31,820
Well,

5460
02:15:31,820 --> 02:15:35,390
there's a place in Siberia called
the Thai Gow and there's this guy,

5461
02:15:35,391 --> 02:15:37,940
you mean you ever see that
documentary grizzly man?

5462
02:15:38,110 --> 02:15:38,880
No.

5463
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:41,640
He ever heard of Werner
Herzog documentary and he's,

5464
02:15:41,690 --> 02:15:43,370
he got a bunch of really
good documentaries.

5465
02:15:43,370 --> 02:15:44,750
He's famous for his documentary.

5466
02:15:44,751 --> 02:15:46,090
That most recent one was about the,

5467
02:15:46,200 --> 02:15:47,810
you see that one about the cave paintings,

5468
02:15:48,130 --> 02:15:49,670
the cave paintings in France,

5469
02:15:49,671 --> 02:15:50,700
that really ancient,

5470
02:15:50,780 --> 02:15:51,980
incredible cave paintings.

5471
02:15:52,340 --> 02:15:52,701
But anyway,

5472
02:15:52,701 --> 02:15:53,600
this Herzog guy,

5473
02:15:53,601 --> 02:15:58,340
he's a really good documentary and he
had this thing about people that live in

5474
02:15:58,341 --> 02:16:02,390
Siberia and it was like happy
people life on the taiga.

5475
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:05,870
And it's all about these people
that just fucking trap and fish.

5476
02:16:06,140 --> 02:16:07,010
And that's,

5477
02:16:07,160 --> 02:16:08,210
there's still their culture.

5478
02:16:08,300 --> 02:16:08,990
That's all they do.

5479
02:16:08,990 --> 02:16:09,561
That's all they do.

5480
02:16:09,561 --> 02:16:12,610
And they trap and that pays for
like chainsaws and shit like that.

5481
02:16:12,611 --> 02:16:13,050
So that,

5482
02:16:13,050 --> 02:16:13,310
you know,

5483
02:16:13,310 --> 02:16:14,690
the tools are essential tools.

5484
02:16:15,110 --> 02:16:17,180
And then from that they,

5485
02:16:17,210 --> 02:16:17,720
um,

5486
02:16:17,720 --> 02:16:18,041
they,

5487
02:16:18,041 --> 02:16:22,160
they just fish and trap and
hunt all year that is there,

5488
02:16:22,161 --> 02:16:23,810
that that's their entire existence.

5489
02:16:23,811 --> 02:16:27,050
And apparently there's
like no mental problems.

5490
02:16:27,150 --> 02:16:27,540
Everybody,

5491
02:16:27,540 --> 02:16:30,050
like people are fairly
healthy is skincare to them,

5492
02:16:30,051 --> 02:16:32,650
that it's life is clear and um,

5493
02:16:32,651 --> 02:16:32,891
they,

5494
02:16:32,891 --> 02:16:34,030
they actually enjoy it.

5495
02:16:34,180 --> 02:16:36,580
Like they were all getting together
and they were talking about how,

5496
02:16:36,581 --> 02:16:37,780
what good fun hunting,

5497
02:16:37,781 --> 02:16:38,720
what do you want to do tomorrow?

5498
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:39,700
Let's go fishing.

5499
02:16:40,280 --> 02:16:41,350
They fished and they hunt.

5500
02:16:41,500 --> 02:16:42,101
It's a good idea.

5501
02:16:42,101 --> 02:16:44,470
And they have to store up
a certain amount of meat.

5502
02:16:44,620 --> 02:16:48,580
So from that show I started getting
obsessed with all these other Alaska shows

5503
02:16:48,970 --> 02:16:49,511
and uh,

5504
02:16:49,511 --> 02:16:51,220
the show mountain men were these dude,

5505
02:16:51,221 --> 02:16:53,440
this one dude's living in North Carolina,

5506
02:16:53,441 --> 02:16:56,860
another dude's living in Montana
and other dude was living in Alaska.

5507
02:16:56,890 --> 02:16:57,920
But the guy living in Alaska,

5508
02:16:57,921 --> 02:17:01,900
it's live in the craziest fucking life
because this guy is a trapper and he

5509
02:17:01,901 --> 02:17:06,901
flies on a little plane hours into the
wilderness hours and then lands and he

5510
02:17:07,511 --> 02:17:09,010
has the same spotty lands every year.

5511
02:17:09,011 --> 02:17:12,730
He's got this clearance that he's made
and he has a trail that he's made and he

5512
02:17:12,790 --> 02:17:14,170
is a trap trail.

5513
02:17:14,171 --> 02:17:17,650
So he takes this trail with
a snowmobile and leaves,

5514
02:17:17,651 --> 02:17:19,120
traps all along the way,

5515
02:17:19,390 --> 02:17:22,180
and then comes back every
day or every couple days,

5516
02:17:22,181 --> 02:17:22,571
whatever,

5517
02:17:22,571 --> 02:17:25,660
and collects the dead animals and
he stays up there from months.

5518
02:17:25,930 --> 02:17:29,830
No people believe just by
himself in a fucking log cabin.

5519
02:17:30,190 --> 02:17:33,640
It's Khorasan like you watching
this guy's life and you go,

5520
02:17:33,641 --> 02:17:34,150
whoa.

5521
02:17:34,150 --> 02:17:36,220
That's where your fucking coat comes from.

5522
02:17:36,700 --> 02:17:40,360
Like that is something that's
a crazy lifestyle choice.

5523
02:17:40,420 --> 02:17:41,640
That's a correct whoever he'll go with,

5524
02:17:41,641 --> 02:17:42,311
stand up comedy.

5525
02:17:42,311 --> 02:17:43,630
It's gotta be the hardest
thing in the world.

5526
02:17:43,690 --> 02:17:45,010
I'm thinking liquid his life.

5527
02:17:45,160 --> 02:17:46,360
I'm obsessed with these shows,

5528
02:17:46,361 --> 02:17:46,571
man.

5529
02:17:46,571 --> 02:17:46,930
I'm set.

5530
02:17:46,930 --> 02:17:49,240
I'm obsessed with the idea
of subsistence living,

5531
02:17:49,630 --> 02:17:50,470
living off the land,

5532
02:17:50,471 --> 02:17:51,460
these people living off the land.

5533
02:17:51,490 --> 02:17:52,323
It's amazing.

5534
02:17:52,360 --> 02:17:52,961
And Alaska.

5535
02:17:52,961 --> 02:17:56,860
The last frontier is the best one because
they got really intelligent people.

5536
02:17:56,861 --> 02:17:58,330
That's a new discovery channel show.

5537
02:17:58,630 --> 02:18:02,110
They have these really smart fucking
people like you're hearing them talk and

5538
02:18:02,111 --> 02:18:04,870
like these are not
uneducated people there.

5539
02:18:04,871 --> 02:18:09,871
They're smart people that have lived
several generations up there in Alaska.

5540
02:18:10,540 --> 02:18:15,540
They're family was a escaping a war torn
Europe and so they moved to Alaska to

5541
02:18:15,551 --> 02:18:16,420
be homesteaders.

5542
02:18:16,420 --> 02:18:19,870
They got like this giant piece of land
starting to growing cattle out there.

5543
02:18:20,470 --> 02:18:24,190
So crazy fucking reality
that these people live.

5544
02:18:24,250 --> 02:18:24,940
But again,

5545
02:18:24,940 --> 02:18:26,380
they seem pretty fucking happy man.

5546
02:18:26,410 --> 02:18:27,220
You've been up there?

5547
02:18:27,220 --> 02:18:27,490
No,

5548
02:18:27,490 --> 02:18:28,330
never been to Alaska.

5549
02:18:28,360 --> 02:18:29,260
It's supposed to be amazing though.

5550
02:18:29,850 --> 02:18:30,710
It's supposed to be some Ma.

5551
02:18:30,970 --> 02:18:32,470
It's real game changing shit.

5552
02:18:32,500 --> 02:18:37,030
Like when you say like the the wilderness
up there that it's a state so far away

5553
02:18:37,120 --> 02:18:38,950
they say eagles are everywhere there.

5554
02:18:39,610 --> 02:18:42,670
Have you ever seen like any of those
videos of eagles like swarming,

5555
02:18:42,671 --> 02:18:44,860
like the where the fishermen go?

5556
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:46,690
I'd never seen a swarm of eagles.

5557
02:18:47,470 --> 02:18:48,640
It's crazy.

5558
02:18:49,510 --> 02:18:50,860
I'll pull up a video,

5559
02:18:50,890 --> 02:18:51,091
I'll,

5560
02:18:51,091 --> 02:18:51,480
I'll,

5561
02:18:51,480 --> 02:18:51,820
I'll,

5562
02:18:51,820 --> 02:18:52,440
I'll get her out.

5563
02:18:52,440 --> 02:18:53,380
Death we'd okay.

5564
02:18:54,880 --> 02:18:55,490
Yeah.

5565
02:18:55,490 --> 02:18:58,520
It looked for m three g Carter while you,

5566
02:18:58,970 --> 02:18:59,211
yeah,

5567
02:18:59,211 --> 02:19:00,044
I have mine.

5568
02:19:00,860 --> 02:19:01,693
I have it here.

5569
02:19:01,790 --> 02:19:02,990
I should lock it in.

5570
02:19:03,550 --> 02:19:04,310
Uh,

5571
02:19:04,310 --> 02:19:04,821
but anyway,

5572
02:19:04,821 --> 02:19:05,210
the,

5573
02:19:05,210 --> 02:19:06,043
the um,

5574
02:19:10,500 --> 02:19:11,040
what do you,

5575
02:19:11,040 --> 02:19:11,731
what are you going to Google?

5576
02:19:11,731 --> 02:19:12,630
What's the exact term?

5577
02:19:13,530 --> 02:19:14,400
Swarm of eagles.

5578
02:19:14,401 --> 02:19:14,820
Butthole.

5579
02:19:14,820 --> 02:19:15,240
Yeah.

5580
02:19:15,240 --> 02:19:16,240
No swamp vehicles.

5581
02:19:16,260 --> 02:19:16,861
Salmon,

5582
02:19:16,861 --> 02:19:17,694
Alaska.

5583
02:19:18,360 --> 02:19:18,710
They,

5584
02:19:18,710 --> 02:19:19,110
they,

5585
02:19:19,110 --> 02:19:19,860
they swore,

5586
02:19:19,860 --> 02:19:20,341
I mean you,

5587
02:19:20,341 --> 02:19:21,240
you can't believe it though.

5588
02:19:21,241 --> 02:19:23,550
You're talking about like
30 or 40 bald eagles.

5589
02:19:23,790 --> 02:19:25,020
They're sitting on this lawn.

5590
02:19:25,740 --> 02:19:26,610
It's incredible.

5591
02:19:27,210 --> 02:19:28,250
It's really a,

5592
02:19:28,380 --> 02:19:32,490
one of those things that if
you didn't see it on the video,

5593
02:19:32,491 --> 02:19:33,570
you would think it'd be fake.

5594
02:19:33,930 --> 02:19:35,550
But apparently people
that go up there and say,

5595
02:19:35,551 --> 02:19:36,780
that's really what they're like up there.

5596
02:19:36,781 --> 02:19:38,130
There's a shitload of eagles,

5597
02:19:39,270 --> 02:19:40,360
but you still can't kill him.

5598
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:41,060
Kill him.

5599
02:19:41,060 --> 02:19:41,900
Nichold a shitload.

5600
02:19:42,160 --> 02:19:43,540
Not like a gaggle

5601
02:19:44,390 --> 02:19:45,223
flock.

5602
02:19:46,130 --> 02:19:46,941
I don't think that was it,

5603
02:19:46,941 --> 02:19:47,180
Brian.

5604
02:19:47,180 --> 02:19:48,013
It was a,

5605
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:48,411
here,

5606
02:19:48,411 --> 02:19:48,550
I'll,

5607
02:19:48,550 --> 02:19:48,741
I'll,

5608
02:19:48,741 --> 02:19:49,700
I'll go vote real quick.

5609
02:19:51,020 --> 02:19:51,550
It's

5610
02:19:51,550 --> 02:19:52,383
crazy to watch.

5611
02:19:52,660 --> 02:19:52,991
Eagles.

5612
02:19:52,991 --> 02:19:53,824
Alaska

5613
02:19:56,500 --> 02:19:57,730
Eagles is called a swarm.

5614
02:19:58,900 --> 02:20:00,100
He goes on lawn.

5615
02:20:00,160 --> 02:20:00,993
Let's see.

5616
02:20:01,090 --> 02:20:01,640
Yeah,

5617
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:02,860
but eagles on lawn.

5618
02:20:02,980 --> 02:20:03,281
Oh,

5619
02:20:03,281 --> 02:20:04,450
how bad are you a Google sign?

5620
02:20:05,370 --> 02:20:09,220
You just go eagles on law and first
video over 30 bald eagles in the

5621
02:20:09,310 --> 02:20:10,143
backyard.

5622
02:20:10,180 --> 02:20:10,781
It's these people.

5623
02:20:10,781 --> 02:20:12,070
They just got back from fishing.

5624
02:20:12,460 --> 02:20:13,570
And so they take these,

5625
02:20:13,571 --> 02:20:13,990
uh,

5626
02:20:13,990 --> 02:20:15,520
these salmons and,

5627
02:20:15,521 --> 02:20:15,940
uh,

5628
02:20:15,940 --> 02:20:19,420
the salmon bodies and they
throw the body to the,

5629
02:20:19,421 --> 02:20:19,601
uh,

5630
02:20:19,601 --> 02:20:21,270
the fish after they filleted it and like,

5631
02:20:21,590 --> 02:20:22,660
they're feeding the eagles.

5632
02:20:22,661 --> 02:20:23,770
It's fucking crazy,

5633
02:20:23,771 --> 02:20:24,604
man.

5634
02:20:26,990 --> 02:20:28,340
Where do you see all these fucking things?

5635
02:20:28,341 --> 02:20:29,174
Right?

5636
02:20:29,420 --> 02:20:30,620
Pick that one up there on that roof.

5637
02:20:30,830 --> 02:20:32,060
Let's go find some bald eagles.

5638
02:20:33,560 --> 02:20:34,393
Look at this.

5639
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:37,333
Look at that.

5640
02:20:37,580 --> 02:20:41,690
They have a whole yard and all
of the roof was behind the yard.

5641
02:20:41,870 --> 02:20:42,171
Six,

5642
02:20:42,171 --> 02:20:42,471
seven,

5643
02:20:42,471 --> 02:20:42,621
eight,

5644
02:20:42,621 --> 02:20:42,891
nine,

5645
02:20:42,891 --> 02:20:43,131
10,

5646
02:20:43,131 --> 02:20:43,431
11,

5647
02:20:43,431 --> 02:20:44,000
12,

5648
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:44,301
13,

5649
02:20:44,301 --> 02:20:44,541
14,

5650
02:20:44,541 --> 02:20:45,200
15.

5651
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:46,250
They swarmed on you.

5652
02:20:46,251 --> 02:20:47,930
They could fuck you up.

5653
02:20:48,220 --> 02:20:49,520
Oh yeah.

5654
02:20:50,320 --> 02:20:51,580
Egos really could,

5655
02:20:51,581 --> 02:20:51,920
man.

5656
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:52,753
Look at all of them.

5657
02:20:52,760 --> 02:20:53,630
It's amazing.

5658
02:20:53,960 --> 02:20:55,370
Those are bald eagles.

5659
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:56,780
I never saw anything like that.

5660
02:20:57,740 --> 02:20:58,573
It's crazy.

5661
02:20:58,940 --> 02:20:59,121
Well,

5662
02:20:59,121 --> 02:21:00,080
people in Alaska,

5663
02:21:00,081 --> 02:21:00,351
man,

5664
02:21:00,351 --> 02:21:01,820
you get a see shit like this.

5665
02:21:01,850 --> 02:21:02,121
Yeah,

5666
02:21:02,121 --> 02:21:03,350
you do live in the frozen.

5667
02:21:03,351 --> 02:21:04,490
We'll new wilderness,

5668
02:21:04,700 --> 02:21:06,140
but you get to see shit like this.

5669
02:21:06,141 --> 02:21:07,100
This is a trip.

5670
02:21:07,580 --> 02:21:07,761
Now.

5671
02:21:07,761 --> 02:21:09,130
This is a protector it up in the last,

5672
02:21:09,190 --> 02:21:09,711
Oh yes,

5673
02:21:09,711 --> 02:21:11,360
they arm and they're protected everywhere,

5674
02:21:11,450 --> 02:21:12,950
but this is a part of your reality.

5675
02:21:12,951 --> 02:21:13,710
If you live up there,

5676
02:21:13,710 --> 02:21:14,780
look at this reality.

5677
02:21:14,930 --> 02:21:19,190
Your reality is you're surrounded
by bald eagles and mountains,

5678
02:21:20,090 --> 02:21:21,620
and especially like
right now in the summer,

5679
02:21:21,621 --> 02:21:22,850
it must be awesome.

5680
02:21:23,930 --> 02:21:25,190
The thing is like,

5681
02:21:25,490 --> 02:21:26,930
look at these kids walking up.

5682
02:21:26,960 --> 02:21:27,321
Wow.

5683
02:21:27,321 --> 02:21:29,390
I would not let my kid
go near a fucking eagle.

5684
02:21:30,860 --> 02:21:32,780
I would have a shotgun
and trained on those pugs

5685
02:21:35,390 --> 02:21:37,220
because eagles have
carried off babies before.

5686
02:21:37,910 --> 02:21:38,061
Yeah,

5687
02:21:38,061 --> 02:21:38,451
that's true,

5688
02:21:38,451 --> 02:21:38,820
right?

5689
02:21:38,820 --> 02:21:39,560
Oh yeah.

5690
02:21:39,560 --> 02:21:42,650
All these executives to just take these
children and he is an old picture of an

5691
02:21:42,651 --> 02:21:44,480
eagle trying to carry off a child.

5692
02:21:44,810 --> 02:21:47,810
There's a video of a
eagles killing wolves.

5693
02:21:51,190 --> 02:21:52,280
You got to see that.

5694
02:21:52,430 --> 02:21:53,330
Look at these fucking,

5695
02:21:53,331 --> 02:21:56,000
that kid has no idea how
different his life is.

5696
02:21:57,070 --> 02:21:57,903
Yeah.

5697
02:21:58,160 --> 02:21:58,341
Well,

5698
02:21:58,341 --> 02:21:59,800
they don't have any idea how weird it is.

5699
02:21:59,801 --> 02:22:01,550
See a gang of eagles in your backyard.

5700
02:22:02,360 --> 02:22:03,320
30 Eagles.

5701
02:22:04,720 --> 02:22:06,410
I thought there were solitary animals.

5702
02:22:06,411 --> 02:22:07,610
I didn't know they flew together.

5703
02:22:08,360 --> 02:22:13,340
I think there's so much salmon in
Alaska that when the salmon is running,

5704
02:22:13,370 --> 02:22:17,720
apparently they'd go bananas and they
just all get together and say fuck it.

5705
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:24,350
Ari Shaffir did stand up in Alaska and
went salmon fishing and he said it's the

5706
02:22:24,351 --> 02:22:25,740
craziest thing he's ever done in his life.

5707
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:27,000
He said it was amazing.

5708
02:22:27,001 --> 02:22:28,950
I shouldn't say it's the craziest
thing he's ever done in his life,

5709
02:22:28,951 --> 02:22:29,784
cause I wouldn't be,

5710
02:22:29,820 --> 02:22:30,653
that wouldn't be true.

5711
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:34,950
But he said it was amazing and they would
eat raw salmon right from the side of

5712
02:22:34,951 --> 02:22:35,401
the boat.

5713
02:22:35,401 --> 02:22:36,930
That would just slap the salmon down,

5714
02:22:37,110 --> 02:22:37,950
cut it open,

5715
02:22:38,550 --> 02:22:39,960
take chunks out of it and just eat it.

5716
02:22:39,961 --> 02:22:40,710
That's correct.

5717
02:22:40,710 --> 02:22:41,760
He said it was delicious.

5718
02:22:41,761 --> 02:22:43,980
It sounds like the greatest Sushi
could ever eat in your life.

5719
02:22:44,410 --> 02:22:45,091
You think that's gross,

5720
02:22:45,091 --> 02:22:45,321
but yeah,

5721
02:22:45,321 --> 02:22:46,120
you had Sushi.

5722
02:22:46,120 --> 02:22:46,953
I know.

5723
02:22:47,080 --> 02:22:48,390
I just don't like the faces.

5724
02:22:49,220 --> 02:22:49,850
Faces.

5725
02:22:49,850 --> 02:22:50,011
Oh,

5726
02:22:50,011 --> 02:22:50,701
the faces.

5727
02:22:50,701 --> 02:22:53,310
You don't like the being
responsible for the death.

5728
02:22:53,820 --> 02:22:54,720
Have you ever killed a fish?

5729
02:22:54,980 --> 02:22:55,221
Oh yeah.

5730
02:22:55,221 --> 02:22:55,401
Yeah.

5731
02:22:55,401 --> 02:22:56,780
We haven't gone fishing and all that shit.

5732
02:22:56,810 --> 02:22:57,980
But you always feel bad.

5733
02:22:58,010 --> 02:22:58,311
Yeah.

5734
02:22:58,311 --> 02:22:59,144
I don't know.

5735
02:22:59,930 --> 02:23:00,763
Yeah,

5736
02:23:01,180 --> 02:23:02,013
not me.

5737
02:23:02,780 --> 02:23:03,613
Not Fish.

5738
02:23:03,850 --> 02:23:05,170
I don't really feel bad about fish at all.

5739
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:05,381
I mean,

5740
02:23:05,381 --> 02:23:06,790
I don't want them to be tortured,

5741
02:23:06,970 --> 02:23:08,320
but I will eat the shit out of them.

5742
02:23:08,400 --> 02:23:09,090
And if I catch,

5743
02:23:09,090 --> 02:23:10,570
if you hook them button in their mouth,

5744
02:23:10,571 --> 02:23:11,890
they already starting to torture.

5745
02:23:12,240 --> 02:23:12,610
Oh,

5746
02:23:12,610 --> 02:23:14,350
someone sounds like if Hagen,

5747
02:23:14,650 --> 02:23:19,650
no history person for if a fish
people for ethical treatment of fish.

5748
02:23:21,160 --> 02:23:23,070
I like to think of it pit,

5749
02:23:23,170 --> 02:23:26,710
if that's the cracks you have about
people that only their pescatarians.

5750
02:23:26,840 --> 02:23:27,673
Yeah.

5751
02:23:27,700 --> 02:23:28,001
It's like,

5752
02:23:28,001 --> 02:23:30,450
how do you know a fish doesn't
have fucking bad feelings?

5753
02:23:30,451 --> 02:23:31,420
Someone said this to my wife.

5754
02:23:31,421 --> 02:23:31,870
She said,

5755
02:23:31,870 --> 02:23:32,290
uh,

5756
02:23:32,290 --> 02:23:32,770
she said,

5757
02:23:32,770 --> 02:23:33,010
uh,

5758
02:23:33,010 --> 02:23:34,210
fish don't raise their babies.

5759
02:23:35,410 --> 02:23:35,711
I went,

5760
02:23:35,711 --> 02:23:36,500
whoa.

5761
02:23:36,500 --> 02:23:37,140
She was truly,

5762
02:23:37,140 --> 02:23:37,973
even dolphins.

5763
02:23:38,320 --> 02:23:39,340
Dolphins aren't fish.

5764
02:23:39,370 --> 02:23:39,791
Oh yeah,

5765
02:23:39,791 --> 02:23:40,624
they're mammals.

5766
02:23:41,170 --> 02:23:42,200
But she said no.

5767
02:23:42,400 --> 02:23:44,490
There's dolphins that are fish to whites.

5768
02:23:44,590 --> 02:23:45,423
There's dolphins,

5769
02:23:47,320 --> 02:23:47,711
Mahi,

5770
02:23:47,711 --> 02:23:48,041
Mahi.

5771
02:23:48,041 --> 02:23:49,480
Actually they call them dolphin fish.

5772
02:23:49,510 --> 02:23:49,691
Yeah,

5773
02:23:49,691 --> 02:23:50,471
I know what you're talking about.

5774
02:23:50,471 --> 02:23:50,890
Yeah,

5775
02:23:50,890 --> 02:23:51,271
that's fine.

5776
02:23:51,271 --> 02:23:54,550
Because I read that in a magazine once
when I was just starting to fish and I

5777
02:23:54,551 --> 02:23:54,851
was like,

5778
02:23:54,851 --> 02:23:56,350
why people fish for dolphins?

5779
02:23:56,351 --> 02:23:57,200
That's crazy.

5780
02:23:57,240 --> 02:23:58,090
It's not the same dog.

5781
02:23:58,091 --> 02:23:58,820
It's not the,

5782
02:23:58,820 --> 02:24:01,660
it's actually a fish that
the flipper type don't know.

5783
02:24:01,780 --> 02:24:02,141
Yeah.

5784
02:24:02,141 --> 02:24:05,290
It's not really called
a dolphin very often.

5785
02:24:05,530 --> 02:24:06,790
It's mostly called Mahima.

5786
02:24:06,990 --> 02:24:07,240
Good.

5787
02:24:07,240 --> 02:24:08,070
Occasionally on the break,

5788
02:24:08,070 --> 02:24:08,650
Casey,

5789
02:24:08,650 --> 02:24:09,071
man,

5790
02:24:09,071 --> 02:24:10,030
you don't give a fuck.

5791
02:24:10,031 --> 02:24:10,230
Dot.

5792
02:24:10,230 --> 02:24:11,140
Merera silly,

5793
02:24:11,141 --> 02:24:11,680
silly.

5794
02:24:11,680 --> 02:24:13,330
He's owed on the age.

5795
02:24:13,850 --> 02:24:14,171
All right,

5796
02:24:14,171 --> 02:24:16,030
Brian has got to get the fuck outta here.

5797
02:24:16,031 --> 02:24:17,130
We gotta send this boys.

5798
02:24:17,140 --> 02:24:17,681
It was fun.

5799
02:24:17,681 --> 02:24:21,040
I'll tell you son of a B all the
way down to San Diego tonight.

5800
02:24:21,080 --> 02:24:22,390
American Comedy Company,

5801
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:23,680
eight o'clock show folks,

5802

Sarah,

5804
02:24:26,021 --> 02:24:26,854
Tiana,

5805
02:24:26,950 --> 02:24:27,900
Jason Tebow,

Billy Ball now.

5807
02:24:30,400 --> 02:24:31,240
And what is the,

5808
02:24:31,241 --> 02:24:31,331

the way they can save some money and if
you go to American comedy Co and to buy

5810
02:24:35,861 --> 02:24:36,551
your tickets,

5811
02:24:36,551 --> 02:24:37,900
if you use the coupon code,

5812
02:24:37,960 --> 02:24:39,880
end of end of days,

5813
02:24:39,881 --> 02:24:40,541
I believe it is.

5814
02:24:40,541 --> 02:24:41,890
Let me just double check the end of days.

5815
02:24:41,891 --> 02:24:42,520
We'll give you [inaudible]

5816
02:24:42,520 --> 02:24:43,140

5817
02:24:43,140 --> 02:24:43,600
uh,

5818
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:44,140
tickets.

5819
02:24:44,140 --> 02:24:45,070
That's what we're talking about.

5820
02:24:45,071 --> 02:24:46,660
Folks were talking about end of days.

5821
02:24:46,690 --> 02:24:48,010
So if it is all over,

5822
02:24:48,011 --> 02:24:48,791
what do you want to do it tonight?

5823
02:24:48,791 --> 02:24:51,850
You want to stay home and watch TV or
go out and get your fucking freak on.

5824
02:24:52,090 --> 02:24:52,900
Okay,

5825
02:24:52,900 --> 02:24:53,740
go ahead and get your freak on.

5826
02:24:53,741 --> 02:24:54,574
It's gonna be fun.

5827
02:24:54,770 --> 02:24:55,340
Should be fun.

5828
02:24:55,340 --> 02:24:55,571
Uh,

5829
02:24:55,571 --> 02:24:55,920
all right.

5830
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:56,111
Uh,

5831
02:24:56,111 --> 02:24:59,110
we will be back Sunday
at four in the afternoon.

5832
02:24:59,111 --> 02:25:03,910
It very odd show with a very odd gentlemen
that will be Dennis Mckenna and uh,

5833
02:25:03,940 --> 02:25:04,810
that will be a,

5834
02:25:04,811 --> 02:25:05,860
that's going to be really interesting.

5835
02:25:05,861 --> 02:25:07,690
I'm very curious to talk to him.

5836
02:25:07,900 --> 02:25:08,320
Uh,

5837
02:25:08,320 --> 02:25:10,450
it should be incredibly fascinating
if you don't know who he is.

5838
02:25:10,451 --> 02:25:14,170
He's the brother of one of the most
famous psychedelic adventures of all time.

5839
02:25:14,171 --> 02:25:15,820
Dennis can a Terence Mckenna,

5840
02:25:15,821 --> 02:25:20,821
his brother and a Terence Mckenna is
responsible for probably some of the most

5841
02:25:21,341 --> 02:25:22,750
influential works on,

5842
02:25:22,751 --> 02:25:23,040
on,

5843
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:24,180
on psychedelics ever

5844
02:25:24,290 --> 02:25:25,890
the most influential points of view.

5845
02:25:25,891 --> 02:25:29,430
And Dennis was with him through a lot
of that stuff and he's got a book on it

5846
02:25:29,431 --> 02:25:29,880
now.

5847
02:25:29,880 --> 02:25:30,290
Um,

5848
02:25:30,290 --> 02:25:35,130
a strange name to the book Brotherhood
of the screaming abyss or something like

5849
02:25:35,131 --> 02:25:35,640
that.

5850
02:25:35,640 --> 02:25:36,840
Sweet Dolphin kisses.

5851
02:25:36,900 --> 02:25:37,830
I don't think that's in there.

5852
02:25:38,400 --> 02:25:38,910
Hold on,

5853
02:25:38,910 --> 02:25:39,271
let me,

5854
02:25:39,271 --> 02:25:39,750
uh,

5855
02:25:39,750 --> 02:25:40,800
Dennis Mckenna book.

5856
02:25:41,770 --> 02:25:43,020
I want to make sure I

5859
02:25:50,380 --> 02:25:51,490
This is what's important.

5860
02:25:51,491 --> 02:25:52,324
Ladies and gentlemen,

5861
02:25:52,330 --> 02:25:55,970
the two Rs is first and
please come to see me.

5862
02:25:55,990 --> 02:25:58,750
A good night's let me pack
the place on New Year's Eve.

5863
02:25:58,751 --> 02:26:01,060
I'm happy to go back to North Carolina.

5864
02:26:01,090 --> 02:26:01,241
Yeah,

5865
02:26:01,241 --> 02:26:01,990
that's a good club,

5866
02:26:01,990 --> 02:26:02,291
Charlie.

5867
02:26:02,291 --> 02:26:03,010
Good Nights.

5868
02:26:03,010 --> 02:26:04,030
We did rally recently.

5869
02:26:04,060 --> 02:26:04,893
Raleigh's fun man.

5870
02:26:05,110 --> 02:26:06,400
Brotherhood of the screaming your best.

5871
02:26:06,401 --> 02:26:07,234
That's the book.

5872
02:26:07,390 --> 02:26:09,580
If you want to read that
book before the interview,

5873
02:26:09,581 --> 02:26:12,730
it might be interesting to give you a
little perspective if you're down with it.

5874
02:26:13,110 --> 02:26:13,360
Uh,

5875
02:26:13,360 --> 02:26:13,631
but,

5876
02:26:13,631 --> 02:26:13,810
uh,

5877
02:26:13,810 --> 02:26:14,800
Dennis is a brilliant,

5878
02:26:14,801 --> 02:26:16,100
brilliant guy and uh,

5879
02:26:16,120 --> 02:26:16,953
he's an,

5880
02:26:17,080 --> 02:26:18,160
I don't even know how to say this.

5881
02:26:18,161 --> 02:26:19,790
Ethno pharmacologist and,

5882
02:26:19,960 --> 02:26:20,351
and a,

5883
02:26:20,351 --> 02:26:23,740
and an author and a well known
psychedelics proponent should be,

5884
02:26:23,741 --> 02:26:24,110
uh,

5885
02:26:24,110 --> 02:26:25,180
should be fascinating.

5886
02:26:25,240 --> 02:26:27,220
He's a brother to well known
psychedelics proponent.

5887
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:29,050
I don't know if he's a proponent himself.

5888
02:26:29,140 --> 02:26:30,550
He's probably a bit Hedgie.

5889
02:26:30,700 --> 02:26:31,930
He's a scientific man.

5890
02:26:32,900 --> 02:26:33,551
This comes in.

5891
02:26:33,551 --> 02:26:34,430
I'm just a Gamer.

5892
02:26:34,450 --> 02:26:34,901
Joe.

5893
02:26:34,901 --> 02:26:36,640
Not sure why you want me to come here.

5894
02:26:36,810 --> 02:26:37,643
Sprung guy.

5895
02:26:37,670 --> 02:26:38,030

I forgot what.

5910
02:26:46,761 --> 02:26:47,580
We'll figure it out.

5911
02:26:47,580 --> 02:26:47,781

It's available on the iTunes store.

5927
02:27:08,470 --> 02:27:08,581
Yeah.

5928

It's only two 99.

5929
02:27:09,790 --> 02:27:11,410
And I'm cursing games,

5930
02:27:11,411 --> 02:27:11,801
which is our,

5931
02:27:11,801 --> 02:27:12,130
yeah.

5932
02:27:12,130 --> 02:27:12,701
How do you go wrong?

5933
02:27:12,701 --> 02:27:13,534
They're signing it,

5934
02:27:13,830 --> 02:27:15,410
losing money by not buying it.

5935
02:27:15,440 --> 02:27:16,330
So they're,

5936
02:27:16,340 --> 02:27:16,471
they're,

5937
02:27:16,471 --> 02:27:16,931
they're the,

5938
02:27:16,931 --> 02:27:21,931
the latest sponsor of this podcast and
kerosene games are committed to making

5939
02:27:22,271 --> 02:27:23,350
all of their games.

5940
02:27:23,400 --> 02:27:23,650
Uh,

5941
02:27:23,650 --> 02:27:28,470
originally for iPad and I
phones and now they're in the,

5942
02:27:28,560 --> 02:27:31,780
in the middle of a developing it
for the high end android devices.

5943
02:27:31,930 --> 02:27:33,190
That'll be January and February.

5944
02:27:33,191 --> 02:27:34,030
But it's a cool game.

5945
02:27:34,240 --> 02:27:35,290
It's great graphics.

5946
02:27:35,320 --> 02:27:35,951
It's again,

5947
02:27:35,951 --> 02:27:37,570
designed for the IPAD.

5948
02:27:37,571 --> 02:27:38,530
It's not ported over.

5949
02:27:38,531 --> 02:27:42,610
They're designed for it and it's only two
99 and they're supporting the podcast.

5950
02:27:42,611 --> 02:27:43,360
So go,

5951
02:27:43,360 --> 02:27:44,380
go check that shit out.

5952
02:27:44,410 --> 02:27:44,651

throw three bucks the way,

5954
02:27:45,800 --> 02:27:48,880

5955
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:50,650

Louis C K it will be five bucks.

5959
02:28:03,101 --> 02:28:05,890
It'll be the same thing you'd be
able to download at a bunch of gray.

5960
02:28:06,290 --> 02:28:06,820
Yeah.

5961
02:28:06,820 --> 02:28:07,800
So please don't steal it.

5962
02:28:07,801 --> 02:28:08,340
Just go.

5963
02:28:08,340 --> 02:28:09,640
I paid a lot of money to make it.

5964
02:28:10,120 --> 02:28:10,960
Um,

5965
02:28:11,080 --> 02:28:11,801
but other than that,

5966
02:28:11,801 --> 02:28:12,040

5967
02:28:12,040 --> 02:28:12,520

And we'll see you all on Sunday,

5971
02:28:20,590 --> 02:28:22,550
right here from

5972
02:28:22,730 --> 02:28:23,900
the middle of nowhere,

5973
02:28:24,440 --> 02:28:25,840
which is the bottom of everywhere.

5974
02:28:25,850 --> 02:28:28,610
Exactly where it's just
the top of the beyond

5975
02:28:30,110 --> 02:28:31,100
