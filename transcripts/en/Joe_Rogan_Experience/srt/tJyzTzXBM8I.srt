1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,160
Can you hear us?
Are we up and cracking?

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,570
We had sound for a second there.
Oh,

3
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:13,050
we did have some.
It just didn't show it in the window.

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:20,170
We have sound now.
Just come on and jump over to the 

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,310
pitches.
Chuck over there.

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,930
Try.
They'll tell you right up immediately.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,530
Get the chat is faggots and they're all 
living in now.

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,800
It's chance gay.
I heard you for two seconds just now.

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,630
Yes.
Okay.

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,270
It's working eggs and so Chicago out of 
this.

11
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:43,500
Right.
Otherwise it won't work.

12
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,620
All right.
I'll tell the twitter people last time.

13
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,150
This is week though this thing because 
it already adds.

14
00:00:58,151 --> 00:00:59,050
Hey,
Joe Rogan.

15
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,750
Si.
Hi.

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,100
Welcome to the Joe Rogan podcast.
Where's that?

17
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,770
Tom and I figured out the technical 
difficulties.

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,280
I'm Brian Tom Zass and we've got to get 
it out.

19
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,910
So we got our Tomahawk pipe that we're 
going to over the last week.

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,670
You said a peace pipe.
What is a peace pipe?

21
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,430
Fucking battle.
A war.

22
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,670
Your choice bitch firepower.
I don't think it's probably the best 

23
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:34,820
pipe.
It looks like a piece of shit.

24
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:37,710
It's already clogged.
Clogged.

25
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:38,030
No,

26
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,280
it looks cool though,
but we got a real one right here.

27
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,450
So what I fuck around bitches and since 
all three of us are legal,

28
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,590
this were illegally medicating here.
See what you're looking at is three sick

29
00:01:54,921 --> 00:01:59,921
people.
Are you get headaches is I get 

30
00:01:59,921 --> 00:01:59,921
headaches,
sleeplessness,

31
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:02,000
sleeplessness,
and headaches from Mr [inaudible],

32
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,910
headaches,
sleeplessness,

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,630
and I said I had surgery the year 
before.

34
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,630
That's all true.
I get really bad anxiety,

35
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,750
but the rest of the sentence is when I 
smoke weed.

36
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,070
All right.
We're up and cracking people.

37
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,840
You keep your partner bag like the 
oldest that was given to me.

38
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,510
I was like,
there's no other reason.

39
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:31,860
So,
uh,

40
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,120
I should kill his game music and sound 
really gay.

41
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:41,370
It's just not really good.
Created by and for homosexuals.

42
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,620
Why does it fit with the vibe we're 
trying to follow here?

43
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,150
You guys are liars and it's completely 
cool.

44
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,670
Um,
what do we lie about Fela?

45
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,580
Oh,
about our prescriptions.

46
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,100
It helps me sleep one wrong.
Gives me anxiety that I had.

47
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,880
And it did.
It is legal,

48
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,290
right?
If you had to guess,

49
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,590
either everyone's watching you or no 
one's locked in you,

50
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,860
what would you say?
Everybody feels like everybody's 

51
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,890
watching me.
[inaudible] you're paranoid.

52
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:23,530
Yeah.
He gets paranoid when he smokes weed,

53
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,450
but that's what I told the doctor and he
still gave it to me.

54
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,620
Is Everybody in here?
Here we go.

55
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,490
Oh,
you need to unpack that.

56
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,460
This one?
Yeah.

57
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,720
This one's fucked us up.
I got some weak ass wack ass DSL 

58
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,270
Internet,
but I'm a new internet installed.

59
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,570
I just have to install a new router and 
then from there we'll be able to upload 

60
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,980
videos.
We'll be able to.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm going to change this background and 
bring a couch in here and get rid of 

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,760
this desk and put a new desk in and so I
only have one desk.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,700
I got this big ass long desolate rooms 
all clogged up.

64
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,060
Someone put a couch in here.
Have a little table right there.

65
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,980
We have the microphone set up there so 
we can lounge and do this properly.

66
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,930
Ladies and gentlemen,
check this shit out.

67
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,610
I just got an.
This is awful.

68
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:14,611
Imagine having to deal with this.
My mom has a windows xp computer that's 

69
00:04:14,611 --> 00:04:18,211
like seven years old and she only has 56
k Internet available at her house.

70
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Really trying to help her fix a computer
from a virus and she could only connect 

71
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,051
at 56,000
people in viruses.

72
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,550
Me Shoot.computer.
There's no way you're gonna fix it,

73
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,040
but can you imagine only getting 56 gay?
No,

74
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,750
I can't.
I did for a long time.

75
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,700
Shit.
I started out with 14 four.

76
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,990
I started out with the AOL on an old ass
mack,

77
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,240
one of those tan ones,
the beige ones,

78
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,750
and it had a 14 for Bard Internet 
connection.

79
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,480
Do you remember how brutal that Shit 
was?

80
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,840
Remember when three d came out,
motherfucker.

81
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,940
Everybody got 56 can.
I was like,

82
00:04:57,941 --> 00:04:59,350
man,
I can't believe it.

83
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,380
That's like five times as fast.
I remember paying like $120 for 56 k 

84
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,160
modem back in the day and that was like 
so much money.

85
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,380
Just like,
oh,

86
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,260
you gotta tell people online who wants 
to use it on gun?

87
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,330
Hey,
you couldn't use the goddamn phone.

88
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,900
That's craziness man.
Well,

89
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:22,800
now that's a t and t uverse thing.
If the phone goes,

90
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,790
if the Internet goes down,
everything's down.

91
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,110
If the computer,
if the,

92
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:26,770
the,
uh,

93
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:29,950
the tvs down,
then you're falling down fire arrows to.

94
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:33,750
Everything's done.
How would you match them?

95
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,870
You've got to go by memory.
How boys was telling you masturbating,

96
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,520
but memory.
Shower the whole time.

97
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,340
Wow.
Look at you.

98
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:45,341
You sexy.
Cavemen had to draw what they wanted to 

99
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:45,341
masturbate to first.

100
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:49,060
Like Kate mentioned,
raped and fucked.

101
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:54,061
I don't think they bothered masturbate.
Masturbation is a byproduct of 

102
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:58,231
civilization.
If we were in civilized will be raped 

103
00:05:58,231 --> 00:05:58,231
and like a motherfucker,
it'd be no.

104
00:05:58,231 --> 00:05:59,520
There'd be no masturbating.
You just find someone there.

105
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,620
Be No gay.
Yeah.

106
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,670
Rape her brother and she had been raped 
and everybody.

107
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,040
Yeah,
there would be no masturbation if there 

108
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,080
was caveman right now.
I don't know.

109
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,400
I think there's a lot more work because 
there was no other way that we're going 

110
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,110
to have good old people.
Old People just get raped all day.

111
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,310
Everybody be waiting in line to rape the
next old person when you didn't have a 

112
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:21,590
language and couldn't say,
Hey,

113
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:24,020
fucking stop and you couldn't fight 
someone off.

114
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,250
Back in those days it was just ready to 
reason with people and say,

115
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:30,830
listen,
when you are raping me,

116
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,530
you're hurting me.
I know it feels good temporarily,

117
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:38,531
but there's other solutions.
You can't talk someone out of rape when 

118
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,220
there's no language.
They just tack your ass.

119
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,610
Right?
I mean that's logic,

120
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:48,611
right?
Do you think a girl that's in a coma is 

121
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:48,611
just like a robot fucked off?
No,

122
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:49,780
she didn't do anything.
No.

123
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,790
That's rude,
man.

124
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,220
That's not a doll.
It's a person.

125
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,810
She's never going to come out to come 
and go,

126
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,600
so.
But she's still a human being issue.

127
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,060
I don't know.
Here's the thing about promise.

128
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:07,210
Have you ever seen like one of those 
interviews where someone was in a coma 

129
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,421
for like seven years and then for 
whatever reason I just woke up and he 

130
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:11,540
said he was awake the whole time.
Would that be awful?

131
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,600
So fuck that man.
Get Web casts tips from Anthony Kumina.

132
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,590
That's a very good idea.
Next time I go on,

133
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,170
oh,
ONA would definitely gonna do that.

134
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,400
We're going to find out what it is.
A great one from us is a two pound.

135
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,350
His is interesting.

136
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,340
Once you get your Internet,
that's all I'm waiting for.

137
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,820
I just bring my laptop over here and 
this shit will be changed.

138
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,840
Ryan's connect go off.
I've been just waiting for the Internet 

139
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,080
upgrade.
I think this is a good thing to commit 

140
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,080
to.
This is the 2010 commitment.

141
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,440
We're going to do this every week so 
easy.

142
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,120
Just hop on and fuck around and 
everybody enjoys it.

143
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,430
Does Anthony,
does anthony have guests?

144
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,630
He's got everything,
man.

145
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:55,631
He's got guests.
He's got these cameras that are like 

146
00:07:55,631 --> 00:07:56,090
real,
like studio quality cameras.

147
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,580
He's got real like radio station 
microphones.

148
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:01,130
Get everything.
He's got a background green screen so he

149
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:03,140
changes.
It can make it look too.

150
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:09,070
That's what we need.
This back wall needs to be a fucking 

151
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,990
green screen behind that roller coaster 
effect.

152
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,890
How hard would that be?
That wouldn't be hard,

153
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:14,360
right?
Buy.

154
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,310
I have a sheet.
I can bring a street over there.

155
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,840
That's going to happen right there.

156
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,910
The weld cables installed,
I just need to change the router.

157
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:28,110
Okay.
Take a picture of this and grades grade 

158
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:28,110
the exact same background behind us.
Oh,

159
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,660
that'd be so dope.
You know,

160
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:30,710
be cool.
If it is.

161
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:35,711
If we added like two mirrors looking 
into each other where they look 

162
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:38,650
infinitely.
If you see that video I posted today on 

163
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,920
your message board under.
I wish so.

164
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,750
I can't wait to my cell phone.
Does this?

165
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,730
No,
there's,

166
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,590
there's a video on Joe's message board.
It's under the topic on the called.

167
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:52,650
I can't wait till my cell phone does 
this and it's this company that does a 

168
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:57,330
special effects so that you can pretty 
much and it shows all their samples and 

169
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:02,061
it's just like backgrounds of buildings 
that you would never think was a green 

170
00:09:02,061 --> 00:09:03,420
screen and it just shows you like the 
scenes first and then it shows how.

171
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,890
Yeah,
it's amazing.

172
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:06,840
Could you imagine if you could do that 
with your phone?

173
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:09,300
If you could like put your phone down 
and change.

174
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:14,301
We're looking at,
you know that's what's going to happen 

175
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:16,680
eventually when they figured out how to 
broadcast images and make them look real

176
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:21,681
like it's right in front of you,
like not just on a screen but an actual 

177
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:23,280
hologram that looks real right in front 
of you.

178
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,550
God Damn.
Could you imagine when your tv becomes 

179
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,670
something that you just place in the 
middle of your living room?

180
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:34,620
You put it down on the image just cause 
man,

181
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:39,621
like old school Princess Leia type shit.
But like you can't tell the difference 

182
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:39,900
though.
You know what I mean?

183
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,610
Calling tents.
Would that be.

184
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,800
It will start off like vhs quality where
you're like,

185
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,850
I could kinda tell the different salts.
Staticky and television was the big 

186
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,810
thing.
If the three d glasses though,

187
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,000
fuck has one where you don't have to.

188
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,980
Well I didn't see them in three d I saw 
in regular and even in regular.

189
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:01,560
Holy fucking shit.
That movie's good.

190
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,960
It's not like a good movie,
like really great writing and you can't 

191
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,861
believe they were there.
You see everything coming a mile away 

192
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:09,861
and you don't care.
I'll probably,

193
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:15,070
I just feel like no,
you're not going to say it's all right.

194
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,180
If you get super baked,
you're going to love the fuck out of 

195
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,180
that movie.
It's so you say,

196
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,911
you know,
either it has to listen to this story 

197
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:30,410
though.
You're going to see the storyline,

198
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,420
but it's not going make that up,
but it's not for that.

199
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:34,800
It's a comic book,
man.

200
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,380
It's bullshit.
It's just entertainment.

201
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,410
Just pretend like you're 15 again and 
you're just watching some.

202
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,490
Oh my God.
Is there good action.

203
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,710
Jesus fucking Christ,
Bro.

204
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,810
I didn't want to tell you about it 
because I don't want to ruin it.

205
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:49,710
I don't.
I don't wanna.

206
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:51,260
I don't wanna be the,
the,

207
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,010
my shit like that.
Or just pocket spy movie.

208
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:59,560
This thing is off the charts and I 
didn't even see it in three d apparently

209
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:01,020
in three d.
it's insane.

210
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,830
Like Black said that three days a month 
because he was movies more than anybody,

211
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,100
but I'm asking.
Not Necessary,

212
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,750
but I've asked her to lead.
He's probably seen 10 times already 

213
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,530
received a few times.
Mike Black,

214
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,660
if you've talked to him on a Tuesday as 
they want to see a movie,

215
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:18,720
he's already seen everything.
Jesus every week,

216
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,030
he just goes every week.

217
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,350
He's always gets that midnight.
Showing movies when they're good,

218
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,690
like Avatar was a great experience.
There's something,

219
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:32,691
I believe there's something about seeing
a movie in front of a bunch of people 

220
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:35,961
too.
It's a totally different experience 

221
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:35,961
watching a movie by yourself,
you know,

222
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,980
when is it shitty movie.
Then you're just watching a movie shitty

223
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:39,940
movie with a bunch of people and it's 
succeed.

224
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:45,530
We also help with three m.
We still walked fucking terrible.

225
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,730
That movie was so.
There's people that love couldn't know,

226
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,980
but I think they're hell boy fans.
They're fans.

227
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,990
The comic book first

228
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,820
and that's what we fucked up on.
We were.

229
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,590
We didn't know what was going on.
I couldn't get high enough to.

230
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,600
What's the responsibility of the movie 
to make you understand even if you're 

231
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:03,600
not a fan.
Yes,

232
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,670
but that's what happens in those big,
like big story.

233
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:10,790
Things like Harry Potter.
I saw the last Harry Potter,

234
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,210
which fuck it was death.
I couldn't.

235
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:15,380
I couldn't.
I couldn't wait for it to be over.

236
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,200
It was like being in jail.
It was terrible.

237
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:20,180
It was.
It wasn't even remotely entertaining.

238
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,560
There was nothing entertaining about 
Harry Potter.

239
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:24,220
It was pretty good.
The first one was really,

240
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:26,820
really good.
Where their head broom,

241
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:27,950
broomball thing.
Yeah.

242
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:29,720
That was fucking dope.
I don't agree.

243
00:12:29,721 --> 00:12:31,520
Monster.
One of the second ones.

244
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:34,870
I think a second one was when the dragon
was coming after him.

245
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,170
Was that the second one?
I think that was.

246
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,120
You know,
I think that was the third one.

247
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:43,150
The third one with the tree.
That dragon scene was worth the whole 

248
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,961
movie and may like,
like everybody talks about how the hulk 

249
00:12:46,961 --> 00:12:49,100
shocks that have totally sucked,
but when he's fucking shit up man,

250
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,180
and you're worth it.
That was,

251
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,120
I want a new marvel movies.
I've been pretty good.

252
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,950
The iron man.
It's fucking insane.

253
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,910
The new one looks even crazier and 
that's going to be a good story.

254
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,180
Along with the action.
I could watch Wolverine Man.

255
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:06,190
The last little was stupid.
I'm sure the action is just as good as 

256
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,891
some other stuff,
but it's like it was too predictable.

257
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,040
Like there's like there's the scene 
where the gasolines running away from 

258
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,980
the car and he's walking away and he 
likes to,

259
00:13:15,981 --> 00:13:17,330
gasoline in the car,
blows up behind.

260
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,100
How many fucking times can you see that 
one?

261
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,720
That fucking scene is

262
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,840
and they don't even look into exactly 
what

263
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,270
was.
It was just so stupid.

264
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:30,850
So like I'm a bad ass,
you know,

265
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,880
that you got to come up with a new way 
to be the new bad ass isn't like some 

266
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,381
guys like snarling and the new bad ass 
is the guy like fate or it doesn't say 

267
00:13:40,381 --> 00:13:41,460
shit.
I would do it.

268
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,840
I'm trying to be cool.
I like to start to walk away,

269
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:45,790
but then I started to assume what's 
going to happen.

270
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,840
So I started on like,
yeah,

271
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:47,320
and I'm like,
wait,

272
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:49,540
what's happening?
And then we'll close for strap.

273
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,200
No stupid.
How can you assume it's not going to hit

274
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:54,700
you?
It's going to blow up back there.

275
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:58,360
It's going to come flying off trail so 
long and around a building.

276
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:04,610
Yeah.
I would run like a phil pay above the 

277
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:04,610
line.
It still want to say,

278
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:04,610
yeah,
pay a bundle.

279
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,160
I said,
look,

280
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:10,290
I'm pretty sure in the movies,
movies never.

281
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,370
You can talk some sensitive and he'd be 
like,

282
00:14:12,371 --> 00:14:13,150
Yup,
Yup,

283
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,830
Yup.
That'd be a great movie.

284
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,880
Have a guy like a cigarette,
put it out and then just out and yeah,

285
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,740
that would be crazy.

286
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:26,110
Do you guys about this before?
Wouldn't it be awesome to have a job to 

287
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,620
watch moving and just your whole job,
which is going all right.

288
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:32,621
I totally went into,
I want to keep my keys on the dashboard 

289
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,050
while I'm at Mcdonald's or something 
like,

290
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:39,090
you know,
just because so many movies you're into 

291
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:39,090
and then you're like,
oh,

292
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,720
what's so it seems like could be cute.
Yes.

293
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,210
Professional Hollywood independent.
You should start an agency.

294
00:14:46,211 --> 00:14:48,080
So they have that thing where they,

295
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,030
where people go to see TV shows and 
they.

296
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:51,850
It's

297
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,560
probably,
they probably have that already and it's

298
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:58,570
like the gaffer,
but we just never knew what the gaffer 

299
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:58,570
was.
One person.

300
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,810
You're probably bugging a whole bunch of
people.

301
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,970
Totally.
And people just deal with it.

302
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,920
You know?
It's like girls that won't tell you that

303
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:05,780
your breath stinks,
but the more you have to do that,

304
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:06,990
the more takes you out of the movie.
Yeah,

305
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,180
totally.
Yeah.

306
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,500
Well,
there's some scenes like that.

307
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:10,610
An Avatar,
definitely.

308
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,370
There's a couple of scenes that you 
didn't have to do.

309
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:18,630
It was just.
There was a few cliches that were like 

310
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,981
so extreme.
It was almost like it wasn't even a 

311
00:15:20,981 --> 00:15:23,471
movie and was just like,
this is how how clunky some of the 

312
00:15:23,471 --> 00:15:24,710
acting was.
Even sigourney weaver was so clunky,

313
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,570
it wasn't like it was a movie.
It was like,

314
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:31,571
you know how you go to universal studios
and you go on a ride and before the 

315
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:32,150
play,
that little video,

316
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:36,980
it was like that back in,
but you're not fully back in.

317
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,980
You've got to come out and cliches.
We're just so off the charts so that 

318
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,160
Zombie land that it was pretty good,
but then the chicks that I learned at 

319
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,490
the end,
it's almost like you had me at hello and

320
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,310
all of a sudden I'm like,
oh,

321
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:54,311
I'm watching a movie.
Isn't that what that whole movie was 

322
00:15:54,311 --> 00:15:56,420
kind of about cheesy humor mixed with 
zombies and this is what I want to know.

323
00:15:56,421 --> 00:15:59,960
Is There A.
is there a single human being,

324
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:04,040
the saw the ads for that fucking.
Let me tell you about the morgans,

325
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,570
the,
you know the,

326
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,060
the movie with Sarah Jessica Parker and 
you got the new one that's out now.

327
00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:09,740
Something about the morgans.
These.

328
00:16:09,741 --> 00:16:12,300
You're a fucking single Schulman who saw
that?

329
00:16:12,301 --> 00:16:14,280
That ad went fuck.
Yeah,

330
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:17,740
there had to be sure this huge barker 
pounds.

331
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,080
Yeah,
but even a huge Sarah Jessica Parker fan

332
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:22,460
doesn't give a fuck about hugh grant.

333
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,470
Somebody who was coked out of their mind
when agreement,

334
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,260
that fucking movie.
I think we got a winner here.

335
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:33,320
We've got a huge grant and we got Sarah 
Jessica Parker and then someone pulls.

336
00:16:33,321 --> 00:16:33,890
The Guy said,
yeah,

337
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:38,891
but it's 2010.
It must suck to if you're a 

338
00:16:38,891 --> 00:16:42,480
screenwriter.
I'm thinking about Brad Pitt and 

339
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:42,480
Angelina Jolie is like,
awesome.

340
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:42,480
It's like I'm in the studio sometimes 
like,

341
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,321
Hey,
instead of that we're going with these 

342
00:16:47,321 --> 00:16:47,321
guys want to keep it a little low 
budget.

343
00:16:47,321 --> 00:16:48,650
Why would you?
Well,

344
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,320
they're committed.
They have two projects going right now.

345
00:16:51,321 --> 00:16:54,680
It will be at least a year and a half.
This is so good.

346
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,990
We don't need stars.
We don't need,

347
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:59,030
but we don't need talent.

348
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,630
We want a god that got arrested for 
getting blown by black hookers.

349
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,330
Remember the ass gusting one ruined his 
career.

350
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:09,440
Sort of,
but not really.

351
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:10,730
Right.
He kind of came back,

352
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,100
you know,
you could get,

353
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:18,130
you could get busted doing something 
like that if you're an actor and for 

354
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:18,590
some reason it's okay.
Projects in the works already.

355
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,590
They don't want to eat them on credit.
Didn't have anything in the works.

356
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,590
Yeah.
If you've got projects in the works well

357
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,700
he never had anything in the world and 
it's a weird fuck.

358
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,290
Like Mel Gibson had like three things.
Comments.

359
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,460
Were they going to do?
Not Show them?

360
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,260
Let's talk shit about Kramer.
Did you?

361
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:32,390
Uh,
did you ever have to deal with him,

362
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,400
the Jews?
Did you ever have to deal with him at 

363
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:37,400
the college store?
Yeah,

364
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,120
I saw him not in a bad way.
I saw him,

365
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,040
um,
when he got there and I was like,

366
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:40,460
oh,
cool,

367
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,230
grab her sphere.

368
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,220
You know,
it wasn't really there.

369
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,310
It wasn't until,
um,

370
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,470
but then it's almost stage like,
oh,

371
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,630
this isn't good.
People stopped.

372
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,660
People stopped being weirded out by.
It was like that night before it 

373
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,181
happened to Kramer's here,
he's fucking like on crack or something 

374
00:17:56,181 --> 00:17:59,190
with some crazy chick and they're in 
like an hour later,

375
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,650
that all happens.
Either Brent,

376
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:05,690
Ernst or Mazda was,
he told us he came back from the laugh 

377
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,560
factory and told us he was like,
Brent,

378
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,410
what does it bring it up?
Yeah,

379
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,110
that's what I was saying.
Your brand.

380
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,690
No,
I said Brent,

381
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,590
Brent.
Anyway,

382
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:21,591
he came over and just told the to Kramer
what fucking crazy started yelling 

383
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:21,591
nigger people.
We were like,

384
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:23,310
what?
We thought it was like another.

385
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:26,460
What else thinks the world of comedy.
You always hear about some shit.

386
00:18:26,461 --> 00:18:27,120
Like,
hey,

387
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:32,121
we heard what happened.
Tom Perez pulled his cock out and slap 

388
00:18:32,121 --> 00:18:32,121
some lady in the face of that.

389
00:18:32,121 --> 00:18:32,960
Like,
shut the fuck up man.

390
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,080
Mad.
It's getting crazy.

391
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,240
That's normal dress.
Cool.

392
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,860
I wish I would've been there.
I left like an hour.

393
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,420
Yeah,
you'd be pissed off.

394
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,240
One of the things about the old school 
comedy stores,

395
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:44,490
you never wanted to go home because you 
never knew what the fuck was going on.

396
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,420
I made the mistake of thinking of shows 
over where a guy who was minding out big

397
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:53,421
broken up with by a porn star,
she started fondling and touching her 

398
00:18:53,421 --> 00:18:56,871
boyfriend who was there and he was like,
please pick her up on a please take me 

399
00:18:56,871 --> 00:18:56,871
back.
I can change.

400
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,560
And they got on stage.
I thought it was done.

401
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,160
I was like,
ah.

402
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:00,780
That was a great night,
and I left later.

403
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:05,781
The porn star.
It was fucking her boyfriend right to 

404
00:19:05,781 --> 00:19:05,940
the side of the stage while everybody 
was watching.

405
00:19:05,941 --> 00:19:06,310
Yeah.

406
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,680
Well,
what barriers have gone home?

407
00:19:10,681 --> 00:19:12,240
It just seemed like it was all wrapped 
up.

408
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,940
That shit will happen all the time to 
come to them ever known.

409
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:19,941
You're going to see their line of seen 
everything on a penis and the comedy 

410
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:23,401
store.
It seems like everyone was just showing 

411
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:24,300
you your Dick Comics like that.
So it's so funny because it's funny.

412
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's hilarious.
Let's stick with your flacid gross penis

413
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,640
chick's name that was onstage where Joey
was in the back of the room at the 

414
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,861
original one,
came out and kept pulling his balls out 

415
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:39,861
and she thought she was calling the 
police.

416
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,570
She was terrible.
She was a terrible convenient.

417
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,280
Chrissy,
I forget what her name.

418
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,550
No,
no,

419
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:45,660
no.
Anyway,

420
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,340
whatever the chick's name was.
She.

421
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:52,370
She's on stage and she's one of those 
lifers that had been doing comedy like 

422
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,370
20 plus years,
but it never made a living out of it,

423
00:19:53,371 --> 00:19:58,371
which was the comedy store,
Kinda like kept those people around 

424
00:19:58,371 --> 00:19:58,371
where it's like those people like the 
really,

425
00:19:58,371 --> 00:20:00,900
really crazy people that are not really 
in the world of comedy,

426
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:02,190
but they're sort of in the world 
economy.

427
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,230
They don't get up at the Improv,
they don't get.

428
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,810
But at the store those people would get 
actually get on,

429
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,280
really want to stage time and they want 
to run through them and panic when you 

430
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,311
see them on the line because you thought
they would clear the room and they 

431
00:20:16,311 --> 00:20:18,391
would.
They will usually will clear that 

432
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:18,391
fucking room anytime the time.
Yeah,

433
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:22,971
and so anyways,
so she's on stage and every time she 

434
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,881
goes near bucks,
like we all see interactive million 

435
00:20:25,881 --> 00:20:25,890
times.
Julie Diaz is behind her.

436
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:30,891
The way the original room worked,
you could actually sneak up on somebody 

437
00:20:30,891 --> 00:20:34,371
while they're on stage.
Open up the Kurt and gravel curtain 

438
00:20:34,371 --> 00:20:35,700
right there.
Fully stand back.

439
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:38,510
They're told plenty of road you got like
this much room,

440
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,820
so jelly goes back there,
take solace fucking clothes off and 

441
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,661
every time she is a punchline,
he pulls open the curtain and shots 

442
00:20:47,661 --> 00:20:52,050
shaking his balls and his big giant 
grapefruit balls or slapping around and 

443
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,160
then he would close it back up and she 
didn't see shit.

444
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:59,250
She thought she was slated that you guys
liked that one.

445
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:05,310
She was all jolly and happy.
Like all of a sudden she figured comedy 

446
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,210
out like yes,
my hard work has come to fruition.

447
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,740
When that happens through the whole back
row fills it with comedian,

448
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,730
comedian on stage was like,
oh cool.

449
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,740
The comments and watching me,
they whatever.

450
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:20,160
Nope.
We've seen so much crazy shit at that 

451
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,711
place that the comedy store,
the old school hang outs with the best 

452
00:21:22,711 --> 00:21:27,601
part about the comedy store,
the audiences were some of the worst 

453
00:21:27,601 --> 00:21:29,881
ever,
which is one of the reasons why you 

454
00:21:29,881 --> 00:21:29,881
develop like,
like,

455
00:21:29,881 --> 00:21:30,760
like people say like,
Oh,

456
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:32,380
you know,
you're always dealing with hecklers.

457
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:33,330
Like uh,
you know what,

458
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,770
what does that leg is that.
Does that freak you out?

459
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,080
Like when you start out at the comedy 
store,

460
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:39,890
Dude,
you have to deal with hecklers.

461
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,570
Know it's not every time,
but it's like 105.

462
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:46,300
The only time they get rid of the guys 
when violence is about the habit,

463
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,120
it gets to the point of violence.
Like people are standing up screaming at

464
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:54,121
people and the audience members to come 
to the booth and they're complaining 

465
00:21:54,121 --> 00:21:54,450
about a different audience.
Yeah.

466
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,270
You need like people ready to stab 
people for them to do anything.

467
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,210
Otherwise they wouldn't do shit.
So you develop that style,

468
00:22:01,211 --> 00:22:02,650
this style that you like.
You have.

469
00:22:02,651 --> 00:22:06,760
And I have and Joey has where you could 
just flip around.

470
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:09,340
You don't say you're,
you're at from beginning to end.

471
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:14,670
Like some people,
especially like a lot of guys who start 

472
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,270
out in clubs in New York,
you get really short sets,

473
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,440
you know,
you don't get to fuck around on stage 

474
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,440
for a half an hour or an hour and then 
you don't get like those,

475
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:26,510
those nice long sets and when you get 
those nice long sets then you could put 

476
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:30,361
material where you want it and fuck 
around and be loose and it's got a 

477
00:22:30,361 --> 00:22:30,440
showcase.

478
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,440
It's like your seven minutes just to get
ready.

479
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,500
Like Hey,
what's up everyone?

480
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:35,830
And you don't have time at all.
If you go go,

481
00:22:35,831 --> 00:22:36,550
go,
go and get off.

482
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,580
Like isn't it frustrated too?
And you have to do a TV show and you 

483
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:41,580
have to do like seven minutes.
You're like shut.

484
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,140
Not at times a bit and a half and you 
don't know how to set it up.

485
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:44,530
It's like,
yeah,

486
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:49,531
this is a good bit,
but it's really good after talking for 

487
00:22:49,531 --> 00:22:51,360
10 minutes and you know my personality,
you know where I'm coming from there.

488
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,390
It's a different type of.
Yeah,

489
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,280
yeah.
It's totally to seven minutes.

490
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:56,020
That's only pretty much are better at 
that.

491
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:02,430
More realized their potential than 
someone who is reduced along stuff that 

492
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:02,430
has to cut it down.
Yeah.

493
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,930
You get used to what you can get away 
with because you can't really dig a hole

494
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,020
and you really know your pixel if you 
dig a hole in seven minutes.

495
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:13,020
So like there's.
There's bits that I have where I know 

496
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,020
like,
like the baby blow job,

497
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,270
but that's possible whole time that 
someone could fall in the open and close

498
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,430
with that fucking thing.
People would be like,

499
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:19,550
what?
No,

500
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,630
you can't talk about this yet.
I don't know how you think,

501
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,450
but if they know how you think they know
all this guy's just being silly.

502
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:30,451
He's just fucking around.
He's a really nice guy and he realizes 

503
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:30,970
this is all in fun.
We're just having a good time up here.

504
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,720
Then people will accept craziness if 
they know it's all bullshit,

505
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,080
but if they don't know you,
he can't just go on stage and you might 

506
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,080
have this killer,
brilliant bit,

507
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,881
but you'll.
You'll do the first opening line of it 

508
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:44,881
and they'll just start eating it right 
away.

509
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:45,770
Like fuck,
it's like,

510
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:47,600
wow,
I haven't got a whole.

511
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,390
I have a format whole,
I have to fill this.

512
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,080
I have just dropped a bit right now.
It's fuck it,

513
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:56,300
do something else real.
I mean real comedy is in front of an 

514
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,110
audience in comedy,
not comedy on television.

515
00:23:57,111 --> 00:24:02,111
Even comedy.
Like when I felt like I did my comedy 

516
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:02,111
special,
like I'm happy that people can get ahold

517
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:06,580
of it,
but it's really just an ad to get them 

518
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:06,740
to come see us.
The real thing.

519
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:07,420
Yeah.
It's.

520
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,490
I mean it's nice.
It's got the material down and you know,

521
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:15,540
you can see it without having to drive 
across the country to where people are 

522
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:15,540
like,
well,

523
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:15,740
what's the difference?
I can still see the jokes.

524
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:20,741
That's exactly what they saw because 
send me what you miss is the connection 

525
00:24:20,741 --> 00:24:22,180
you make with an audience and you 
weren't in that audience.

526
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:27,780
Feel that,
feel and hear the same things you've 

527
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:27,780
heard and that's a huge point right 
there.

528
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,200
The connection,
because it isn't just the jokes that are

529
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:31,460
really.
It's not,

530
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,900
it's.
You can't discount it.

531
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:37,930
It's a real.
There's a real thing that's happening 

532
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,030
with you in the audience.
It's very strange.

533
00:24:38,031 --> 00:24:38,840
It's like,
um,

534
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,510
like almost like a lego psychic 
connection,

535
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,990
you know,
like there's moments where they know 

536
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,391
exactly what you're thinking and you can
just pause and consider something and 

537
00:24:49,391 --> 00:24:51,260
they'll start laughing because they know
by,

538
00:24:51,261 --> 00:24:55,340
based on having gone there,
they're going there with you,

539
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,430
with other comics,
by watching them on TV.

540
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:03,431
But I do the same thing.
I just heard not too.

541
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:08,561
It still looks right.
It looks like somebody just sent me 

542
00:25:08,561 --> 00:25:08,561
right

543
00:25:08,561 --> 00:25:11,710
tape of some guy check out this guy and 
he's really funny and I was like 

544
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:11,710
watching the clip,
but I'm like,

545
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,510
no,
no.

546
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,800
Laurie Martin.
Remember Her New York.

547
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:22,800
I think January first or second she was 
doing a show that somebody threw a role 

548
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,480
at her read role.
It was just a heckler video and I was 

549
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:26,480
watching Legos.
It's pretty good.

550
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,840
If I was there,
you know,

551
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,490
you don't know what's going to happen.
You're caught up in the moment.

552
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:36,260
She knows that about the crowd.
That's how she was just a certain way.

553
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,810
People love that.
The when,

554
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:41,210
when moments just happen.
When you're in the middle of a show,

555
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,330
no standup comedy really is sort of like
a massive gnosis.

556
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,360
It's like some weird mass connection 
with people and what you're doing with 

557
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,870
like a video is you're just hoping that 
someone will sort of get a little bit of

558
00:25:54,871 --> 00:25:56,340
that connection.
You know,

559
00:25:56,341 --> 00:25:59,640
you'll get like a little,
like a little vibration of it,

560
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:04,641
a little,
just like a faint memory of that 

561
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:06,000
connection.
You get the material and understand good

562
00:26:06,001 --> 00:26:06,990
writing,
all that stuff,

563
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:10,290
but there's a moment that happens when 
you're onstage and you're killing.

564
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:14,120
You know that moment where it's just 
writing sort of feeling,

565
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,080
man,
I don't think too many people understand

566
00:26:16,081 --> 00:26:18,880
that.
You know what people talk about?

567
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,880
Legos is commonly scary.
It's not scary.

568
00:26:20,881 --> 00:26:25,881
People want to have a good time.
You just got to do what you're supposed 

569
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:26,430
to do.
Do putting the work right a lot,

570
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,040
perform a lot,
do it with the right state of mind.

571
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,740
Do it the right intentions.
Do it all for fun.

572
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
As long as you work your.
If you're intelligent and you've been 

573
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,000
doing it,
you know how to do it.

574
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,950
Just fucking do it.
Man

575
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:41,080
No kind of hurt is called scared.
Jonathan got sick,

576
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,290
was on stage once,
I don't know,

577
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:44,160
like 11th or whatever

578
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,470
it was and he was just killing right 
from the start.

579
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,800
It's fucking destroy me

580
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:53,040
about 10 or 12 minutes go,
I have any hiccups because he realized 

581
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:58,001
this might be the best out of all time.
And then he's like the last like three 

582
00:26:58,001 --> 00:26:58,610
minutes,
like a b plus a minus.

583
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,550
And was like,
oh,

584
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,430
but it was like,
oh my God,

585
00:27:01,431 --> 00:27:06,431
I'm doing so well.
He felt responsible for the rest of the 

586
00:27:06,431 --> 00:27:06,431
set and I was like,

587
00:27:06,431 --> 00:27:06,431
done that.
Have you ever.

588
00:27:06,431 --> 00:27:07,190
You talked yourself out of killing.

589
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,420
Yeah,
really good.

590
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,640
Start eating it.
I remember there was a set that I had 

591
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,461
when I first started doing comedy with a
for first five minutes I've fucking 

592
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:20,520
crushed and then I have 10 minutes set 
and then I dropped a glass.

593
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:24,210
I just fumbled,
drop the glass and didn't even know.

594
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:28,480
Dressing,
not worried about killing.

595
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:33,490
Yeah.
And then the next five minutes I just 

596
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,481
ain't shit I fucking shit man.
It was like I went through last thing 

597
00:27:37,341 --> 00:27:39,490
and wow,
this guy's really funny.

598
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,640
What a great choice.
We picked the common show.

599
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,600
This is awesome because it was like,
like

600
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,800
in some weird place in the middle of 
Rhode Island.

601
00:27:46,801 --> 00:27:49,530
It wasn't even a comedy club.
It was like one of these little,

602
00:27:49,531 --> 00:27:52,250
a little comedy gigs that you would get 
where you know,

603
00:27:52,251 --> 00:27:57,251
you drop in and do a guest spot.
Like before you were actually getting 

604
00:27:57,251 --> 00:27:57,251
paid.
You know?

605
00:27:57,251 --> 00:27:59,280
It took me like a year before I ever got
any paid sets,

606
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,160
but before that year there was always 
guys that had like this little bar rooms

607
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:04,590
and you can go up and do 10 minutes.
Like in Boston.

608
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,130
They developed a whole network of those.
There were shows everywhere.

609
00:28:08,131 --> 00:28:09,930
They had comedy night all over the 
place.

610
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:15,170
When I was doing comedy,
they had three comedy clubs on one 

611
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:15,270
block.
Warrington St,

612
00:28:15,271 --> 00:28:18,570
three on one block and a fourth one open
upstairs.

613
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,370
They were all packed.
It was crazy.

614
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,190
And then you had another one that was 
only a block away.

615
00:28:23,191 --> 00:28:28,191
There was a little dicto already place 
and then you had another one stitches 

616
00:28:28,191 --> 00:28:30,240
that was only a couple miles away and 
then on route one you had two huge ones.

617
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,280
You had the quaaludes and you had 
giggles.

618
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:36,120
These are like full time clubs.
Like giggles wasn't collins.

619
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,040
I am maybe.
I think it was just a weekend or two,

620
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,420
but the other ones were seven day a 
week.

621
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:41,490
Clubs.
How many people in Boston don't know?

622
00:28:41,491 --> 00:28:43,050
There's a few million,
but it was crazy,

623
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:44,310
man.
There was stitches,

624
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,100
there was duck soup,
which was later.

625
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:50,370
Later became the Improv and then there 
was,

626
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,550
of course nick's comedy stop.
There were so many fucking clubs.

627
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,910
It was the most incredible place.
I was so lucky.

628
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:02,090
Just a total streak of luck that I was 
in Boston in 1988 when I wanted to do 

629
00:29:03,391 --> 00:29:08,391
comedy because that was like,
that was a mess and it was a mecca for 

630
00:29:08,391 --> 00:29:10,290
the coal country.
For whatever reason.

631
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:15,240
That one place developed all these 
comics mean lack of Denis leary.

632
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,120
What's his face?
Steven,

633
00:29:17,121 --> 00:29:18,440
right?
Uh,

634
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,640
and then guys,
you've never heard of Jay Leno,

635
00:29:20,641 --> 00:29:23,010
of course.
Nick Depaulo.

636
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,830
Anthony Clark,
anything car back then was a murderer.

637
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:30,600
Do Jokes?
Yeah,

638
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:35,601
he,
I think he got a television show and 

639
00:29:35,601 --> 00:29:38,871
things started happening for him and I 
just think a lot of stuff didn't fall 

640
00:29:38,871 --> 00:29:42,921
into place,
but when I was starting out back in 

641
00:29:42,921 --> 00:29:45,501
Boston are,
you should fear of moved away from the 

642
00:29:45,501 --> 00:29:45,501
camera so my grandmother doesn't say,
oh,

643
00:29:45,501 --> 00:29:45,950
that's great.
I'm taking some questions.

644
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,520
That nosy bitch.
She's still watching.

645
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,240
Use Dreams.
Start taking some questions.

646
00:29:50,241 --> 00:29:52,030
So you got so many people asking me 
shit,

647
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,970
man.
Shit happens.

648
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:57,690
No,
no,

649
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,420
no,
no,

650
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,080
no,
no.

651
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,690
How this shit works.
Okay.

652
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,720
When you're on the radio show,
you never have somebody telling you to 

653
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,440
take some calls when they want to.
Not when there's a break.

654
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,900
When there's a break.
That was a break in the conversation.

655
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,310
What's wrong with you?

656
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:22,880
What are the.
What are,

657
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:23,970
what are some questions?

658
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,450
You get reception here today.
TNC.

659
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,990
It's fucking good up here for rise.
Rise.

660
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,080
Rise is terrible up here but a and is 
the bomb diggity but Rosen's better 

661
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,260
everywhere else but.
And I'm going to get something hooked up

662
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,000
where you can have a rise in,
in your house,

663
00:30:41,001 --> 00:30:43,130
through the Internet.
You have like a little internet thing.

664
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:48,420
And it's like,
why cloud for your house where you live 

665
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:48,850
doesn't have good internet.
Sure.

666
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It's actually.
What it does is it uses your wildfire 

667
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,000
and it rebroadcast.
Hey,

668
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,070
this ain't radio so radio,
but I mean a precedent has been set,

669
00:30:58,071 --> 00:30:59,780
sir.
I would try to,

670
00:30:59,781 --> 00:31:01,280
um,
we're doing it like radio,

671
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:06,610
this guy to bias holt.
He's saying red band hit him already.

672
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,970
Listened to fellow.
You got a lot of pent up inside question

673
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,180
answered.
We're friends.

674
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,030
It's actually to give it to them.
We're friends here.

675
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,380
There's no,
no one's hitting anybody.

676
00:31:15,381 --> 00:31:17,030
Got Down to settle the fuck down.

677
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:21,800
Do,
do,

678
00:31:21,801 --> 00:31:22,460
do,
do

679
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,520
so many angry people that,
that,

680
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,030
that,
that,

681
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,880
that hang out in the UFC community.
Well,

682
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:33,910
it's not just the UFC community is in 
the world then there's a lot of angry 

683
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,990
motherfuckers up,
but I've noticed in this 40 5:00

684
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:36,140
AM,
yeah,

685
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,570
the economies in the shitter.
We're in two fucking wars.

686
00:31:38,571 --> 00:31:43,571
That makes zero sense.
There's a lot of angry fucking people 

687
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:43,571
out there,
man.

688
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:45,150
There's a lot of UFC people that have 
noticed.

689
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,160
I've come onto your message board lately
that has kind of taken over the crowd 

690
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,710
and they're either school they give.
A lot of them are cool,

691
00:31:51,711 --> 00:31:56,711
so a lot of there are so many dumb asses
and fucking morons and fighter guys.

692
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:01,990
True,
but the beauty of that message board is 

693
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:01,990
the retard room.
That's the beautiful thing.

694
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,120
If you about this killer message board 
on Joe Rogan Dot net,

695
00:32:05,121 --> 00:32:10,121
it's forums dot Joe Rogan.net,
and these forums we have it set up so 

696
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,850
people are just generally instructed to 
be cool with each other.

697
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:18,850
Don't be retarded.
Post interesting shared talk about 

698
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:19,580
things and occasionally someone will 
fucking blow up.

699
00:32:19,581 --> 00:32:20,960
We'll get retarded,
get stupid.

700
00:32:20,961 --> 00:32:22,230
They get angry,
they get aggro,

701
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:27,231
they start fights and so then we send 
them to the retard room and we have a 

702
00:32:27,231 --> 00:32:30,380
special room that's just for everyone in
it has been deemed a retard.

703
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,790
I mean,
you're not all retarded.

704
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:36,791
I'm not somebody you'd probably just 
young and some of you had a tough life 

705
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:36,800
and you're crazy.
I don't hate you,

706
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:41,830
I just don't want you fucking up the 
conversations and people fuck up the 

707
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:41,830
conversations for more than,
you know,

708
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:45,140
a certain couple of two or three times 
we sent him to this retard room.

709
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,630
It's the greatest invention ever.
I don't know whose it was.

710
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,310
Whose idea was it?
I forget.

711
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Crescent wrench was the guy who came up 
with the idea where everybody should 

712
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,730
have to post porn.
That was his idea,

713
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,940
which was cool.
Yeah,

714
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:00,200
that was.
You got too far because it wasn't about.

715
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,840
It wasn't about saying a cool woman was.
It became like the original better point

716
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:06,820
asshole.

717
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,550
It came like a website where you could 
just get porn.

718
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,460
You wouldn't have to go anywhere else,
but my website to get porn.

719
00:33:13,461 --> 00:33:18,461
It was videos and,
and now with those fucking those you 

720
00:33:18,461 --> 00:33:21,350
porns movies.
Big giant ass fucking pictures.

721
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,030
Yeah.
They're huge.

722
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,440
Twice categories and they look good.
You know,

723
00:33:26,441 --> 00:33:27,520
it's funny.
It's awesome.

724
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,620
The people that were in those addicted 
to porn,

725
00:33:29,621 --> 00:33:32,740
it had the best porn photos were the 
most popular people.

726
00:33:32,741 --> 00:33:33,460
So actually we,
we're,

727
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:38,580
we're friends with the most creepy 
friends and people that are seven 

728
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,130
gigabytes fairly legal

729
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:44,910
go to strip clubs when the girls 
performing with magazines for it aside.

730
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,620
I met Gina Lynn.
She's really pretty.

731
00:33:49,621 --> 00:33:51,060
She's very nice.
That's cool.

732
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,100
It's actually really cool.
She's a nice person.

733
00:33:53,101 --> 00:33:58,101
She's not doing porn very much longer.
They liked them because they want them 

734
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,290
out.
You can do better than this.

735
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:04,020
I just want you to know some students 
are just into it.

736
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,640
Bella said she's done with porn.
Wow.

737
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,700
Acting on them.
What is she going to do now?

738
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,500
Just produce.
Wow.

739
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,590
She's going to become a pimp.
No,

740
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:15,120
she's tired of baseball.
Bats up the pooper.

741
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,040
I don't think she was tired.
You get tired of that.

742
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,640
Continue with the out of nowhere.
It's just like,

743
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,000
oh,
here,

744
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:24,170
here's me.
Here's my asshole.

745
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,040
And you're like,
oh,

746
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:33,990
it really is like that too.
She sends you nsfw not safe for work.

747
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,730
I think even a bigger warning then loads
dripping out of your gaping asshole.

748
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:43,160
That's not just not.
That's not safe for life.

749
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,860
That's ridiculous.
You're showing me.

750
00:34:45,861 --> 00:34:48,920
You show them the whole world.
You're like white to the butthole,

751
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:54,350
like not mysterious lips and suck on 
fingers and taunting you with laundry 

752
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:00,860
wide open pod hall with sperms for 
flowers,

753
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,400
a pitch for those deep.
She goes deep.

754
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:06,200
She takes it to another level.
She does.

755
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,440
She set the bar like a motherfucker.
I've never seen anybody have a baseball 

756
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,620
bat up their ass like that.
It's a loss of the community.

757
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,650
It's a huge loss.
Like Jordan retiring the first time.

758
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,190
It is.

759
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,910
It is.
Who's the dirtiest girl in pour now?

760
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:20,680
Sasha grey.
Now that she's gone

761
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,910
third year,
supposedly really dirty.

762
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,420
It's just a good marketer and dirtier 
than the rest of them.

763
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:30,700
She looks pretty dirty.
What happened?

764
00:35:30,701 --> 00:35:31,410
Brian?
Brian,

765
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:36,550
John Candy thing bouncing on this.
You don't know what the fuck you're 

766
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:36,550
doing.

767
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,540
This is a story behind this thing behind
us and I'm,

768
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:42,350
I'm going to put something up

769
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:47,380
in front of a bunch of pot on the 
ground.

770
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:56,550
Yep.
This side,

771
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,190
Doug,
Stan hope and I were a hosted.

772
00:36:03,191 --> 00:36:08,191
The man show.
There was a segment called make me hard 

773
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:09,090
and the segment,
uh,

774
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,680
we had like boxes attached to dudes 
dicks.

775
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,160
And like we'd show them things like a,
like a midget eating a banana and we 

776
00:36:18,101 --> 00:36:18,910
would decide,
oh,

777
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:20,860
he's getting a hard on during the day.
It was really stupid,

778
00:36:20,861 --> 00:36:25,861
but the whole reason for the bit what so
that we can use this training and it's 

779
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,980
in the bit.
We had this tranny and she was really 

780
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,420
hot.
I mean she's a fucking super hot.

781
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:35,050
Like my friend Eddie saw her in a car 
once and he was Dan at pitches.

782
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,700
Oh look at her.
And I go,

783
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,470
that's a tranny.
And he goes,

784
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,550
no fucking white.
Oh yeah,

785
00:36:39,551 --> 00:36:41,110
we used around on the man show.
So I'm like,

786
00:36:41,111 --> 00:36:41,710
Hey,
what's up?

787
00:36:41,711 --> 00:36:43,180
How you doing?
So anyway,

788
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,980
we've got this guy with the box on.

789
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:49,870
So the idea is that we show them all 
this stuff that's not not sexy like guys

790
00:36:49,871 --> 00:36:51,760
playing with her nipples,
big fat guys.

791
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,610
And the light would go off,
you know,

792
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:57,040
a midgets eating a banana there.
Light would go off.

793
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:02,220
And then we had this super hot chick and
she's rubbing on him and she's touched 

794
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,430
him and nothing.
Nothing's happened.

795
00:37:03,431 --> 00:37:06,220
Is Light is not going up.
And she pulls her tits out,

796
00:37:06,221 --> 00:37:09,250
they'll fuck it,
audience is going crazy and he's sucking

797
00:37:09,251 --> 00:37:10,660
whip cream,
offered tits,

798
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,960
and then she pulls her cock out and her 
composition wrinkled,

799
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:20,230
shriveled up little poison dick because 
it's a real dick.

800
00:37:20,231 --> 00:37:23,590
Like she used to be a man,
but she's been injecting herself with so

801
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:25,910
many female hormones that her dick is 
like,

802
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,520
like addicted.
It's been poisoned.

803
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,180
It was like a monkey that got shot with 
a poison dart,

804
00:37:31,181 --> 00:37:32,800
which you would imagine his dick would 
look like.

805
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,920
It was like dark and shriveled up.
And then of course the lights going off 

806
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:37,920
like crazy thing thing.
They mended funding,

807
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:43,170
but they let us do all this.
What they did let us do was call it,

808
00:37:44,171 --> 00:37:49,171
make me hard.
They wanted to call it and make me 

809
00:37:49,171 --> 00:37:49,900
stiff.
And that was like a legitimate argument.

810
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,680
So you changed it.
So we had to change it for making it 

811
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,920
hard to make any steps to put your foot 
down as a period of sentence there.

812
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,480
No,
it's not hard.

813
00:37:58,481 --> 00:38:03,481
It's not the same.
But that's how dumb it is when you're 

814
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,630
dealing with network television.
That's how dumb their arguments are.

815
00:38:04,631 --> 00:38:09,631
It's like everybody wants to change 
something and they really believe that 

816
00:38:09,631 --> 00:38:11,980
they have to change something to get 
your respect that you,

817
00:38:11,981 --> 00:38:16,981
you know,
that you're going to have to listen to 

818
00:38:16,981 --> 00:38:16,981
them and they want to come in and they 
all,

819
00:38:16,981 --> 00:38:19,620
none of them are creative and all the 
lawsuits,

820
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:24,850
that'd be more offensive.
How could the word hard be more 

821
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:24,850
offensive than the word stiff?
That doesn't even make any sense.

822
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:27,930
Stiff to me sounds like even more like a
pokey,

823
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,650
you know,
like make me hard.

824
00:38:29,651 --> 00:38:30,160
It's like,
oh,

825
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,630
it's like you're a rare and the girl 
make me.

826
00:38:31,631 --> 00:38:34,030
Steph is like,
like you're stabbing somebody with it.

827
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,790
You know?
It's like,

828
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,080
don't you want your Dick each?
Get them stepping.

829
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:41,830
It doesn't sound fun,
but that's all the arguments are men.

830
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:46,870
It's very lazy gentleman.
We're learning because it kind of hit a 

831
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,310
value and be notated value are fairly 
educated to the masses.

832
00:38:48,311 --> 00:38:50,800
So giving you knowledge.
Where's the laptop?

833
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:55,860
It'd be easier to read off the laptop,
get fucking your feet up your internet 

834
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,010
week,
but will be fixed tomorrow.

835
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,380
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're going to do this every week.

836
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,950
We're going to start taking some 
questions now.

837
00:39:05,951 --> 00:39:07,990
Just twitter feeds come into fucking 
fast.

838
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:13,020
It's crazy.
When your twitter feeds going faster 

839
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,020
than chat room.
Usually know she was one of the big news

840
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,880
doors.
Is that Lenny Bruce on the wall?

841
00:39:15,881 --> 00:39:16,360
No,
that's,

842
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:20,770
that's a picture of me from my first CD.
This dude made it with,

843
00:39:20,771 --> 00:39:23,620
uh,
with snake blood.

844
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,920
Some crazy dudes.
To me it makes paintings with snake 

845
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,730
blood and uh,
I uh,

846
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:33,580
lost that dude's email.
So if he gets to see this dude who makes

847
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:35,520
paintings with snake blood,
thank you very much for the picture.

848
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,000
Pretty fucking dope.
And it's up.

849
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:42,001
There was questions are so it's hard to 
read this shit man.

850
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,080
What's going on?
The news right now?

851
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:56,120
Nexus phones coming out for no 
terrorism.

852
00:39:56,121 --> 00:39:58,270
Brian.
A fucking fight.

853
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,650
They don't use this kind of phones,
Joe.

854
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,780
These people don't use those phones?
No,

855
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:03,950
the terrorists.
Oh,

856
00:40:03,951 --> 00:40:04,190
okay.

857
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,350
I don't know what you're saying.

858
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,560
Do do too.
God Damn.

859
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,820
This is impossible to read.

860
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,880
I'm way too high to be reading this 
moving shit.

861
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:26,910
Any updates on the stage moving or what 
are you gonna for sure.

862
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,520
There's so many rumors floating around.
I heard this report,

863
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:33,040
but this doesn't say why I haven't heard
anything official.

864
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,800
I've heard some crazy shit that like 
what?

865
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:38,200
Drinking bleach.
Stabbing himself in the stomach.

866
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:42,280
Fucking I hope that's not real fingering
his asshole.

867
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,870
What?
Don't make that not the fingernail.

868
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,010
So of course that's not funny.
Overdose overdosing.

869
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:55,270
Uh,
that wasn't an accurate drinking bleach.

870
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,860
Like he tried to drink like suicide.
That's certainly open to the hospital.

871
00:40:59,861 --> 00:41:00,930
Um,
uh,

872
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,240
just to get a checkup and then it's 
overblown.

873
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,100
Did you hear the Howard Stern show this 
week?

874
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,420
No,
I haven't heard it at all.

875
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:16,050
It's probably like old news.
Everyone probably knows what's 

876
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:16,050
happening.
He's cry.

877
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:16,420
Fine.
Did you hear about Tiger Woods?

878
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,960
I just love saying that.
I don't even have any news.

879
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,780
Did you hear about the new thing with 
the whiskey or the um,

880
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
the um,
the bottles of vodka and red bull and 

881
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,430
the three hot chicks came up to his 
room.

882
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:35,460
He showed the with your pussy maybe he 
ordered maybe 20 bottles of vodka 

883
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,870
wanting.
In the case of red bull,

884
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,810
I had three really hot chicks up in his 
room.

885
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:43,710
That's how we celebrated New Year's this
year.

886
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:44,920
This year.

887
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,470
It's also a porn video being shot.
Did.

888
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,310
Where did that come from?
I was in the news,

889
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,030
but he was celebrating.
That's that.

890
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:58,830
That's how we celebrated New Year's at 
TMZ apparently was there.

891
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,260
I thought I got let this house.
I think he just said fuck it.

892
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,750
You know,
this year I could see in the packs and I

893
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:06,860
think he just said,
fuck it.

894
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,410
I'm tired of this bullshit.
I'm just going to live.

895
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:12,260
I'm going to live.
My last question for like six months.

896
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:15,900
It'd be over and I like to fuck people 
who's out there who like,

897
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:19,370
he has so much money that he doesn't 
have to work ever again.

898
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,080
Keep working though.
You can keep playing golf,

899
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:22,640
right?
You can totally play play golf,

900
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:26,840
but he doesn't need the endorsements.
Which people get the endorsements back.

901
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:31,870
You'll get different indoors.
So you don't think someone's gonna 

902
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:31,870
sponsor who's winning these tournaments,
but who were they?

903
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:34,100
Keep showing up on Sunday.
Most of the time.

904
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,850
Let's put our logo on his bag is a lot 
of money in that golf.

905
00:42:37,851 --> 00:42:40,160
Huh?
That's a businessman sport.

906
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,860
There's so much money in.
In Big Golf.

907
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,420
Yeah.

908
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:49,490
It's like no offense you get jeff guys 
just doesn't carry as much weight.

909
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:54,740
Do you think people like go into golf 
thinking that you're gonna make money 

910
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,770
off without so hard?
I think it's the same as any sport.

911
00:42:55,771 --> 00:42:57,480
Basketball by the major sports,
basketball,

912
00:42:57,481 --> 00:42:59,620
baseball,
football that you go onto a gun,

913
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:04,621
like I love climbing all star when like 
all the conference you can go to a big 

914
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,910
division one school in the back of your 
head.

915
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,010
You're like,
I want to play pro,

916
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,010
I'm sure.
Right.

917
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,490
But it's just the,
you know,

918
00:43:11,491 --> 00:43:16,491
the hardest thing about becoming a 
professional at anything difficult like 

919
00:43:16,491 --> 00:43:16,491
role for,
you know,

920
00:43:16,491 --> 00:43:18,240
whatever.
Playing football or any sport.

921
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:20,370
It's saying,
okay,

922
00:43:20,371 --> 00:43:25,371
this is what I'm going to do.
Because you don't have a fucking backup 

923
00:43:25,371 --> 00:43:25,371
plan if that's what you're going to do.
Oh yeah.

924
00:43:25,371 --> 00:43:25,400
It's uh,
it's uh,

925
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:26,710
it's the uh,
it's the uh,

926
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,110
scratcher the guy who just make ties on 
tour.

927
00:43:29,111 --> 00:43:34,111
It's got acute school scratch off a 
fucking eighth place finish at the best 

928
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,030
buy for a grant.
You know,

929
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:40,770
hopefully just fighters too.
I see some of them for eight and eight.

930
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:44,880
You find three fights a year,
getting 37 managers see that graphic?

931
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,400
Oh,
Brian's having little conversations.

932
00:43:48,401 --> 00:43:49,000
All of his own.

933
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:57,640
Someone said winning is everything 
cotinus.

934
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:58,230
Okay.

935
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,780
Would you bang Tiger Woods wife right 
now?

936
00:44:01,781 --> 00:44:03,800
I think no,
because she'd be very good

937
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:06,860
vulnerable and I feel feel bad about 
that,

938
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:11,861
but I would fuck the life out.
Considered a bottle or I think poor 

939
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:15,590
girl,
you know,

940
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,570
she's having a hard time right now

941
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:21,180
so I have to rape her or she wants to do
it.

942
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:26,190
She wants to fuck you.
She needs someone to hold her and then 

943
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:28,321
as she's holding you,
you grab her ask and she says nothing 

944
00:44:28,321 --> 00:44:28,780
and then just go for it.
You just go for it.

945
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:31,040
But she doesn't really like grab your 
Dick.

946
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:33,360
You grabbed her hand and put it on your 
desk and she just goes with it.

947
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,670
Does she get into it while she's doing 
that?

948
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:37,650
Sort of a little bit because she feels 
bad,

949
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:42,750
so the whole time.
It sounds like a terrible.

950
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:46,920
I think I'd still then.
I wouldn't be disappointed though.

951
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:49,380
Yeah,
that'd be very disappointing.

952
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,090
It would leave me with a great feeling.
Yeah.

953
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,010
It wouldn't be the.
She got really into it though.

954
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,730
If she gave it.
Sanger became just a bb plus game.

955
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,170
I think that'd be super pleased.

956
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:01,170
So much more important to have a chip 
that's really into it.

957
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,230
It's so important.
A hardship is not into it,

958
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,680
but there's some port.
There's a point of diminishing returns,

959
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:13,120
you know,
like a super hot chick who just lays 

960
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,351
there is a way,
but it's not as not as good as a one 

961
00:45:15,351 --> 00:45:15,480
step down.
It goes crazy,

962
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:19,170
but it is better than down.
Okay.

963
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:24,270
Certain point.
There's like a certain at a certain 

964
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:24,270
weight,
certain smell.

965
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:25,440
So I'm okay.
Okay.

966
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:27,270
I'll take the hot to check.
That doesn't move.

967
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,440
He,
but that.

968
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,630
The answer it gives you a quarter 
credit.

969
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:35,660
Hotness gives you full credit.
So here's the thing that gets me as 

970
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:35,660
those,
those robot things,

971
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,390
those,
those dolls,

972
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:41,420
those real dolls.
Would you fuck one of those because I 

973
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:42,770
don't think I would fuck fuck pillows 
before,

974
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,110
definitely,
but.

975
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:46,320
But I'm saying I wouldn't invest a lot 
of money.

976
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,350
Rather jerk off and fuck that thing.
I'll try it out.

977
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:53,130
How your flesh lastly be good.
Do you think that's good?

978
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,640
I don't know.
I mean sometimes lotion feels better 

979
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:58,640
than not.
Motion feels weird.

980
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:03,420
Here's one thing to fantasize and 
masturbate is just another thing to fuck

981
00:46:03,421 --> 00:46:06,530
a rubber.
That's a totally different thing.

982
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:11,810
I think it feels right.
It's just that the extension that's 

983
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,510
three d versus two d that's just gives 
you more texture.

984
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,520
True,
but it's a thing.

985
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:17,190
It's not your imagination.
With auto manipulation,

986
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,760
it's a thing.
You're fucked enough.

987
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,240
I guess.
I grew up in a rubber thing.

988
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,990
It feels good and as you like closing 
your eyes.

989
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,240
If you could feel something,
it feels like skin.

990
00:46:27,241 --> 00:46:27,820
Like,
Oh,

991
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:33,530
here's my point.
It seems much more humiliating if 

992
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:33,530
someone catches you.
Okay.

993
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:38,440
What the fuck?
Someone catches you fucking have Robert 

994
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:38,440
Dahl.
You feel like shit.

995
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:38,460
I think you're supposed to feel like 
shit.

996
00:46:38,461 --> 00:46:40,050
If someone catches you,
that would be worse.

997
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:45,080
Well,
that's because I think you're supposed 

998
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,701
to feel like shit for doing that.
That's a fucking creepy thing you do 

999
00:46:46,701 --> 00:46:46,701
when you fuck it.
A rubber dog.

1000
00:46:46,701 --> 00:46:47,910
You weirdo.
You should just jerk off.

1001
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:53,060
Oh,
now we're going to make noise noises.

1002
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,470
Actually noises portion of the program

1003
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:15,140
guy says about real dolls day Broomfield
says they look awesome talking.

1004
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:20,430
Taking them to dinner is awkward though.
Did you ever see that movie,

1005
00:47:20,431 --> 00:47:22,640
Lars and the real doll?
Oh,

1006
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,350
just come as ridiculous.
You know,

1007
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:28,610
if you were somebody that never got laid
like forever.

1008
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,340
By the way,
did you guys watch

1009
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,350
that conveyor?
Love that show?

1010
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,550
No,
it's great.

1011
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:36,910
It's a convenience.
It's a new reality show where I.

1012
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:40,300
Four hot chicks just have a conveyor 
belt in front of them and they just send

1013
00:47:40,301 --> 00:47:45,301
guys down.
The Guy has like 20 seconds to impress 

1014
00:47:45,301 --> 00:47:47,110
them or they just go get out of here and
he goes up on the conveyor belt and then

1015
00:47:47,111 --> 00:47:52,111
at the end of 100 guys and they take 
them on a date and so then like there 

1016
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,910
was this one takes like,
oh,

1017
00:47:54,911 --> 00:47:55,980
I just want that guy.
I want to.

1018
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:59,560
I just want to do him so bad.
It was like a guy with no shirt on and a

1019
00:47:59,561 --> 00:48:02,770
puppy and then the next person would be 
like a standup comic,

1020
00:48:02,771 --> 00:48:04,480
like dude,
like do you like fire and you had like a

1021
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:07,050
fireball coming in because this was 
right after,

1022
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,300
uh,
the bachelor,

1023
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:13,220
whatever the bachelor.
It was right after the manager at ABC.

1024
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,260
ABC.

1025
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:19,150
So what are the four for 10?
No conveyor of love.

1026
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:21,590
I think all the people that choose to go
on dates with him later

1027
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,090
and yeah.
And then the dates were off.

1028
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:27,600
Like this one guy is like crazy.
Oh you guys got downloaded.

1029
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:32,690
How incredible is that?
Because when shit got stuck with this 

1030
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:33,000
fat guy that had like really ugly hair 
by mistake,

1031
00:48:33,001 --> 00:48:34,920
because it's a game.
You could steal other people's.

1032
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,760
If there's two girls that want the guy 
than the guy has to decide between the 

1033
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,771
two girls and they're just blunt,
like might be the greatest show of all 

1034
00:48:45,771 --> 00:48:45,771
time.
Oh,

1035
00:48:45,771 --> 00:48:45,771
it's great.
It's so bad.

1036
00:48:45,771 --> 00:48:50,240
It's just like,
look how much more we can let people to 

1037
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,240
meet in themselves.
Do you remember that temptation island?

1038
00:48:51,241 --> 00:48:54,180
Do you remember?
That shit was hilarious.

1039
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,100
That was good too.
How crazy was that?

1040
00:48:56,250 --> 00:49:01,250
They would take these fucking chicks and
tell them to try to get these guys to 

1041
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:05,001
cheat and film everything they did and 
still cheap and they would fuck the 

1042
00:49:05,361 --> 00:49:05,750
girls.

1043
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,130
Is there was a girl who works for fear 
factor.

1044
00:49:10,131 --> 00:49:12,860
That was one of the girls prostitutes.
Yeah.

1045
00:49:12,861 --> 00:49:14,240
Basically.
I mean,

1046
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:18,500
I mean have to be attracted to the.
I don't know.

1047
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:21,080
It's not an American soil.
They're not paying them to fuck them.

1048
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:26,260
They're paying them to flirt,
but the processes with whatever happens,

1049
00:49:26,451 --> 00:49:27,650
if something happens,
you just.

1050
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:29,690
Any girl kissing was like,
okay,

1051
00:49:29,691 --> 00:49:31,400
stop.
I don't know.

1052
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,440
That's a good question.
I don't remember watching.

1053
00:49:33,441 --> 00:49:34,670
I think that would be highly 
discouraged.

1054
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:39,920
Remember Mrs Rogan pink shops at Mrs 
Rogan did not like it.

1055
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,550
She was like,
oh,

1056
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,920
that's terrible.
Show.

1057
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:47,180
So being this week motherfuckers.
They got the weakest.

1058
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,940
Dumbest.
The no,

1059
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,660
but eventually like buckets.

1060
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:55,000
She just wrecked their lives on TV.
Cheaters is so fake,

1061
00:49:55,001 --> 00:49:56,530
by the way.
Did you know that?

1062
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,530
She's not always because he got stabbed 
for no.

1063
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:02,350
Look at the staff video now.
Look at it now.

1064
00:50:02,351 --> 00:50:05,980
It's like watching Iti now and you know,
you see how fake it is.

1065
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,080
Have you watched the stabbing video of 
cheaters?

1066
00:50:08,081 --> 00:50:13,081
Now our brands have gotten past that and
now it's so fake looking like this.

1067
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:19,250
Oh.
And no one's helping them out and he's 

1068
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,510
just like their sport people just 
filming him and stuff and it was just 

1069
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:24,481
sitting there.
Yeah,

1070
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:25,390
dude,
it,

1071
00:50:25,391 --> 00:50:26,560
it,
it looks like etc.

1072
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,500
Watching me now.

1073
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:28,540
Yeah,
you,

1074
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,740
you're just like,
that's a fake alien.

1075
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:33,410
That's What it looks.
Google that right now.

1076
00:50:33,411 --> 00:50:35,700
And this is the beauty of the internet,
but you turn it off.

1077
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:37,170
We walked with them.
No,

1078
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:39,680
no.
Joey greco from cheaters.

1079
00:50:39,681 --> 00:50:42,350
Get stabbed.
The stabbing.

1080
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,380
Now I want you guys to look at it like.
All right.

1081
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:47,450
Real know.
How would this really happened?

1082
00:50:47,451 --> 00:50:48,080
To the one above it.

1083
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,210
Is that the one?
Oh wait,

1084
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:51,570
this one she just getting.
Yeah,

1085
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,240
yeah,
yeah.

1086
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,990
Cheaters get even is what it is.
When you look it up on youtube,

1087
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:57,690
it's just slow.
my,

1088
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:02,390
my internet is so whack.
I'm wearing a white shirt.

1089
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,620
Are You?
I'm wearing trying.

1090
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:05,300
If united though.

1091
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:12,270
That was probably staged first comment 
on a first comment on youtube.

1092
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:14,500
The dude says that was probably staged.

1093
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:16,750
I don't see that shit.

1094
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:19,060
We're watching it right now.
Ladies and gentleman,

1095
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:21,020
this is like we're watching two girls.
One cup,

1096
00:51:21,021 --> 00:51:24,590
except his shit is alive over the 
internet right now.

1097
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,920
We're about to watch joey greco.
The one comment says,

1098
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:30,890
I hope joe is going to be okay.
This happened four years ago,

1099
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
three days ago.
I hope joe is going to bail tech and he 

1100
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,310
would creepy about that.
I think it's her stuff later person.

1101
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,250
She read her posts and either way when 
you get your internet hooked up,

1102
00:51:43,251 --> 00:51:44,990
we will be able to show them what we're 
watching.

1103
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:48,320
just can't do it right.
That will be hooked up next week.

1104
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:51,830
Tomorrow.
Next week's episode.

1105
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,960
We're going to do this every week,
folks.

1106
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,350
All right,
here's the cheater stay.

1107
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:03,830
Let's watch it from the beginning.
I wasn't really paying attention way.

1108
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:04,910
It's beautifully filmed.

1109
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:17,090
Oh,
some guy gets thrown into the water.

1110
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:24,640
Okay.
Somebody's been stabbed.

1111
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:29,770
By the way.
Hold on,

1112
00:52:33,891 --> 00:52:38,891
hold on.
Don't say with the camera.

1113
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,110
Didn't help him out.
He's just been stabbed.

1114
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:50,300
That looks real

1115
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:57,780
well.
You gotta think though that if he did 

1116
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,281
get stabbed,
the guy's a failed actor and he's going 

1117
00:52:59,281 --> 00:53:02,491
to ham it up.
Even if he did get stabbed and if he 

1118
00:53:02,491 --> 00:53:03,460
summed it up,
he's got stabbed.

1119
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:05,380
I wouldn't be holding a camera and 
stuff.

1120
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:05,960
I'd be like,
alright,

1121
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:07,620
can you.
Can you explain?

1122
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:09,010
Yes.

1123
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,810
I'm sure This is available.
You can find this out online.

1124
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:15,220
Okay.
Joey greco was.

1125
00:53:15,221 --> 00:53:16,380
I was name is.
Yeah,

1126
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:23,120
that's it.

1127
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,310
I gotta be honest with you.
It looks pretty fight.

1128
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,490
Okay.
And there's another part.

1129
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:32,410
I had a gas.

1130
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:38,130
Yeah,
there's another part in the video where 

1131
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:38,130
they got the guy that stabbed him

1132
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:38,130
right here.
Cheaters host joey greco.

1133
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:40,220
Stabbing was staged,
says paid actor.

1134
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:42,650
look at that.
And this just came out november

1135
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:44,930
sort of district.

1136
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,450
So this is a recent findinG.
So there recently finding out that whole

1137
00:53:49,451 --> 00:53:50,610
thing was standing.
I told you,

1138
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:52,850
oh my man called it.

1139
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:57,410
Do my brain has gotten past the part 
where where I can just tell

1140
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:02,540
a bit on the air for nine years now,
documenting scorned lovers come 

1141
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:05,850
confronting their cheating partners in 
the act with the camera crew and toe.

1142
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,640
It's like an episode of jerry springer 
field,

1143
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:08,800
blah blah blah,
blah,

1144
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,240
blah,
blah,

1145
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,220
blah.
Inside the district reports today,

1146
00:54:11,221 --> 00:54:16,221
the stabbing was faked and as has was a 
relationship shown on at least one 

1147
00:54:16,471 --> 00:54:17,530
episode.
Sorry.

1148
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,070
There's A siren noise.
A little weirded out by reality.

1149
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:22,230
Blurred websites if those are just made 
up.

1150
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:23,440
That's a good point.

1151
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:26,040
Mike,
would you see inside edition.com?

1152
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:26,550
That might not be

1153
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,620
be the store,
right?

1154
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:32,000
My internet so week.
Wow.

1155
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:36,100
There's another part where they have the
guy that stabbed him in a choke hold.

1156
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:41,340
If you're in a choke hold,
wouldn't you just his hands just like 

1157
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,340
this.
Look,

1158
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,680
why don't you be like trying to punch 
the guy in the face that's has you in a 

1159
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,401
choke hold or tryIng to undo the.
His arms like this and the guys that 

1160
00:54:47,401 --> 00:54:49,540
hasn't been a choke hold his arms to his
side not doing anything.

1161
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,130
Yeah.
This ain't shit.

1162
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:58,370
Okay.
Investigates cheaters is it all hooks 

1163
00:54:58,370 --> 00:54:58,370
each week,
millions of viewers,

1164
00:54:58,370 --> 00:54:58,370
blah,

1165
00:54:58,370 --> 00:54:59,760
blah.
Every episode,

1166
00:54:59,761 --> 00:55:00,090
blah,
blah,

1167
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:00,780
blah,
blah,

1168
00:55:00,781 --> 00:55:01,320
blah,
blah.

1169
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:06,190
Bobby goldstein and shows owners is 
adamant that every episode is real bad.

1170
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:08,550
Bobby goldstein,
you're so full of shit.

1171
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,850
Bobby goldstein.
You're a fucking liar,

1172
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:14,130
dude.
Bobby goldstein.

1173
00:55:14,131 --> 00:55:19,131
This shows owner and executive producer 
is adamant that every episode is real.

1174
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:22,020
Yes.
You're showing real people.

1175
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,360
those are real people.
They're not holograms.

1176
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:27,880
They're not thrilled,
but they're acting mother fucker.

1177
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:29,620
Come on man.
There's the internet.

1178
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:32,040
There's some reshot scenes left and 
right on that show.

1179
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:36,840
It's obvious noW the popular up the fuck
up or I was going to say it.

1180
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,590
Fuck,
is she talking about?

1181
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,570
That's the inside edition abroad.
It's probably interesting.

1182
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:45,540
It's printed here.
That's a goddamn lie.

1183
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:47,270
Let that load up.
Mostly what you have to say.

1184
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:49,350
My mom's internet,
joe,

1185
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:54,530
I did.
This is just one of the websites on the 

1186
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:54,690
web cam.
I've got No juice.

1187
00:55:54,691 --> 00:55:58,120
I got nothing.
The whole thing was fabricated.

1188
00:55:58,121 --> 00:55:59,260
Correct.
Says wyatt.

1189
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:01,060
Alright,
so it's not real at all.

1190
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:06,100
As carrie wyatt who tells inside edition
she was paid $500 to appear in an 

1191
00:56:06,221 --> 00:56:11,221
episode of cheaters.
She said she was asked to pretend that 

1192
00:56:11,221 --> 00:56:11,830
she was having a torrid affair with one 
guy.

1193
00:56:11,831 --> 00:56:13,630
She was while she was engaged to 
another.

1194
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:14,170
Huh?

1195
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,530
Well,
that's a different story though.

1196
00:56:17,531 --> 00:56:19,210
That's what they're saying.
Against what?

1197
00:56:19,211 --> 00:56:20,950
That guy said,
that every episode is real.

1198
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:23,140
They're Just breaking that.
What he's saying is faith.

1199
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:24,230
oh,
will you hold

1200
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,930
inside edition?
your website sucks.

1201
00:56:26,931 --> 00:56:30,620
It is really that sort of the slope you 
have to hit hit on this little.

1202
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:33,350
Put your cursor over this arrow to Get 
your text.

1203
00:56:33,351 --> 00:56:35,090
Just scroll down.
I wonder if this is lick.

1204
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:40,340
You fall from that other guy's website.
I wonder if this is all fake dude 

1205
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,170
looking at inside edition as the worst 
website ever.

1206
00:56:42,171 --> 00:56:43,380
Look,
it's flash based.

1207
00:56:43,381 --> 00:56:45,530
Do you have to hold your cursor over the
fucking hateful ass?

1208
00:56:45,531 --> 00:56:50,531
I'm done with flat.
This is the weakest thing I've ever 

1209
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:50,531
seen.
Or you can't take it.

1210
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:50,531
Scroll down.
No,

1211
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:52,340
you can't do.
You can't use your score.

1212
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:54,770
You have to use their stupid thinG and 
you have to figure it out.

1213
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:57,210
I thought that that was the whole 
article because it was.

1214
00:56:57,211 --> 00:56:59,810
It's actually cut off.
It doesn't even say more at the bottom.

1215
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,490
Shame on you inside edition.

1216
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:04,130
Your arTicles.
Your whole website sucks,

1217
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:09,620
so we're going to move off of it bitch,
but I'm.

1218
00:57:09,621 --> 00:57:12,290
I think I think I would have to go with 
that was a hoax.

1219
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:13,340
Totally.

1220
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:16,840
Every time we watch when he's getting 
choked and just wants his arm.

1221
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:17,890
Now,
if you're getting choked or not,

1222
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,290
arms not just going to be like gently 
resting on your side.

1223
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:25,320
Hold on.
This fellow johnny bananas has a 

1224
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:25,320
question.
Says,

1225
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:25,390
what do you think about the suicide 
bomber?

1226
00:57:25,391 --> 00:57:30,391
That was a cia double agent.
What the fuck is he talkiNg to them 

1227
00:57:30,391 --> 00:57:30,391
about?
Have chem trails and Jordan.

1228
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,740
Oh,
the guy who kIlled all the cia people.

1229
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:37,741
He was a double agent.
Is that what it was approved by the 

1230
00:57:37,741 --> 00:57:37,790
jordanians,
jordanians or drainage or banners.

1231
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,450
And he was a cia agent as well.
Yeah,

1232
00:57:40,451 --> 00:57:45,451
and I don't know.
He killed a bunch of like really high 

1233
00:57:45,451 --> 00:57:45,451
level guys.
there it goes.

1234
00:57:45,451 --> 00:57:48,880
Something like the news stories he 
killed,

1235
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,660
he was recruited through the jordanians 
and they're like,

1236
00:57:52,661 --> 00:57:54,610
no,
the Jordan has never got it back.

1237
00:57:54,611 --> 00:57:55,390
Or I don't know was.

1238
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,550
I can't.
I'm so high.

1239
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:04,160
Can type.

1240
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:10,940
I'm googling the cia.
Suicide bomber news ticker.

1241
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:12,920
This is some crAzy shit.
ladies and gentlemen,

1242
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:18,120
look at this guys.
That's marijuana sodie pop route buzz.

1243
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:22,060
It's um,
I don't like it.

1244
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,730
I like the feeling.
It's um,

1245
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:28,300
it's one of those almost like narcotic 
feelings.

1246
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:31,450
Yeah.
One of the sodas.

1247
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:34,570
I don't like edibles as much anymoRe.
Period.

1248
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:36,830
and yeah,
I don't feel like tripping.

1249
00:58:36,831 --> 00:58:39,050
I just want to get a little high and 
thinking about some shit.

1250
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,290
I don't want to invest that much.
Last day.

1251
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:49,190
THis is crazy shit.
There was a dude who is a cia double 

1252
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:51,510
agent and use the suicide bomber himself
up and a bunch of shit.

1253
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:54,020
So he was,
what does that mean?

1254
00:58:54,021 --> 00:58:56,750
Double agent while he was working for 
the cia,

1255
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:00,110
pretending to be a cia and also working 
for,

1256
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:04,280
I guess al qaeda and the taliban or 
whoever the hell it is.

1257
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:08,360
We sent him to blow everybody out,
but he was a cia agent.

1258
00:59:08,361 --> 00:59:12,060
He was in.
Where was it?

1259
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:14,630
Where did it happen?
It's loading up.

1260
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:19,720
I think it said Jordan Shepherd a local.
yeah,

1261
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:20,930
I guess

1262
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:27,090
cia operatives killed by double agent.
That's pretty intense shit,

1263
00:59:28,451 --> 00:59:30,580
man.
Suicide bomber killed seven,

1264
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:35,610
seven central intelligence agents.
Agency operatives in Afghanistan last 

1265
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,920
week was a jordanian double agent who 
lured them into a meeting by promising 

1266
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:45,780
information on al qaeda leaders,
a form of us intelligence officials set.

1267
00:59:45,781 --> 00:59:49,230
So they,
he lured them in and just blew himself

1268
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,880
up.
Had got them to come to him.

1269
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:54,420
He's going to give them some information
and they're all in the room.

1270
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:59,430
He just went to a restaurant with a year
ago by jordanian authorities who thought

1271
01:00:00,131 --> 01:00:01,750
they had convinced them to work for 
them.

1272
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:05,920
So the jordanians thought they had 
gotten him to work for jordanians.

1273
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,750
Wow.
They thought they can and good guys.

1274
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:11,770
Yeah,
but how the fuck.

1275
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:16,820
Well supposedly you know,
how the fuck did they talk him into 

1276
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:19,801
doing that?
He goT arrested a year ago or a year 

1277
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:23,590
abroad riding good intelligence.
God damn.

1278
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,390
What are.
or that guy as.

1279
01:00:27,391 --> 01:00:29,270
Huh?
He gets friends with them,

1280
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:34,260
get them all on a room and then goes and
just does the whole thing.

1281
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:38,010
Just fucking blows himself up.
How crazy is that?

1282
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:42,300
Oh,
this is brian's new kitty.

1283
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:45,400
You got to see this folks.
Brian scott knew kitty cat.

1284
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:51,360
Let me see this fucking glare.
Can you say it is a short haired 

1285
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:51,360
persian.
So it,

1286
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,490
it brung exotic,
sort of,

1287
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,010
too much glare from this stupid little.

1288
01:00:58,460 --> 01:00:59,120
Oh,
this

1289
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,780
um,
somebody goes into my,

1290
01:01:05,781 --> 01:01:07,730
uh,
girlfriend's work as a breeder.

1291
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:10,010
Said she had kittens,
jessica,

1292
01:01:10,011 --> 01:01:13,610
one entity and I was thinking just 
kittens and then

1293
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,010
she showed me.
I was like,

1294
01:01:15,011 --> 01:01:16,400
oh my god.
That's like a real cat.

1295
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:21,120
Had to get it as opposed to like a tom 
cat type thing.

1296
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:25,390
We had such a good time with the 10 hour
chat.

1297
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:28,640
Our preferred myself,
catholic friends.

1298
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:30,130
Well my cat is a front.

1299
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:32,950
Yeah,
job friends.

1300
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:35,500
It's cool when there's like life all 
around you to.

1301
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:37,900
When you're at home and you're anywhere 
you go,

1302
01:01:37,901 --> 01:01:42,901
there's something going on,
like a creatures like trying to create 

1303
01:01:42,901 --> 01:01:43,200
something or do something.
That's what I feel living on sunset.

1304
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:46,090
This man says,
joey greco is not his real name.

1305
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:48,010
Wow.
Well that doesn't matter.

1306
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:49,000
Well,
It doesn't matter.

1307
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,820
No.
he's a lot of changes in age.

1308
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:53,540
Like carlos,
when ceos fucking the fuck are.

1309
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:58,550
We should fear.
How many times do people mispronounced 

1310
01:01:58,550 --> 01:01:58,550
your name?
Oh,

1311
01:01:58,550 --> 01:01:58,550
it's.
But that's your fucking name.

1312
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:00,490
Sign.
That's a part of the change of name.

1313
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:05,520
You should never changed the name.
Arnold schwarzenegger is arnold swartz 

1314
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,730
and maybe that's part of the flavors.
He's got this fucked up name.

1315
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:09,420
That's part of the thing.
It may.

1316
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:11,130
It defines who you are.
Here's,

1317
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:14,620
here's the thing about cheater.
start watching it and just notice how.

1318
01:02:14,621 --> 01:02:19,621
There's never really good lunches.
There's never a good punches when the 

1319
01:02:19,621 --> 01:02:19,810
fight.

1320
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:21,600
Bob dylan,
bob dole,

1321
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:27,360

See bob dylan.

1322
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:32,150
He's a fucking south haven because good.
It could have been good at their job.

1323
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,900
They just stuck with his name with.
What'd you say?

1324
01:02:34,901 --> 01:02:39,901
It was already taken.
If you stuck with julie kagan state and 

1325
01:02:39,901 --> 01:02:40,900
just still rocked the house,
just that hard.

1326
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:43,840
Maybe they would've just said,
you know what?

1327
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:48,900
Look jess.
Java became famous and she was fat and 

1328
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:48,900
ugly as fuck.
She had a big fat,

1329
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:49,100
stupid face.

1330
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,570
I'm telling You the office example.
I'm not even making sense.

1331
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:03,600
I mean,
I might even go to the heart of the 

1332
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:03,600
archeologists.
Her fucking name itself is cool.

1333
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:07,710
I like wearing makeup.
Nissan's talk about security,

1334
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:11,280
arguing.
That's the chem trail.

1335
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:16,310
Crop trails argument.
Just tell you something else and be 

1336
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:16,310
like,
okay,

1337
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:20,330
that's right man.
I watched a documentary last night on 

1338
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:21,300
ancient aliens on the history channel I 
ordered on dvd.

1339
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:25,620
It's eddie bravo is just always 
constantly talking about aliens,

1340
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:27,130
aliens.
It's like there's.

1341
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:30,120
There comes a certain point in time when
someone is so obsessed with aliens.

1342
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:35,300
you run the risk of once you're married,
the risk of not wanting to even consider

1343
01:03:35,791 --> 01:03:37,460
aliens anymore.
He was like,

1344
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:38,790
son,
it's not real.

1345
01:03:38,791 --> 01:03:41,310
It's not possible,
but it's so possible.

1346
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:46,311
It's possible.
It's more possible when you watCh these 

1347
01:03:46,311 --> 01:03:49,491
videos,
these ancient alien videos where they 

1348
01:03:49,491 --> 01:03:51,561
talked about these ancient structures 
and you know what technology put these 

1349
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:55,881
together.
I think if you just look around at the 

1350
01:03:55,881 --> 01:03:58,911
evidence,
there's not that much evidence that 

1351
01:03:58,911 --> 01:04:00,741
aliens have landed,
but there's a lot of evidence that life 

1352
01:04:00,741 --> 01:04:01,710
on this planet has been fucking 
seriously jacked,

1353
01:04:01,930 --> 01:04:05,070
at least three or four times,
like big ones that we know about.

1354
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:10,750
Extinctions on mass extinctions happened
to the car from inside the house.

1355
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:15,570
Jeff assessment management.
This is my management.

1356
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:17,700
They don't even knoW that I'm fucking 
out a podcast.

1357
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:19,950
I would,
I would think to just suspend management

1358
01:04:19,951 --> 01:04:22,740
would be aware of my podcasting from 
three to five.

1359
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:25,060
unused stream today.
It started at 3:30,

1360
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:26,880
shandra.

1361
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:28,710
Well

1362
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:34,310
that's the best way.
We're all going to be become one on 

1363
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:34,310
twitter.
I'm on the podcast,

1364
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:35,490
so I'll call you later.
Bye.

1365
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:37,050
That was my manager,
shandra.

1366
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:40,110
Very necessarily.
She's on a twitter.

1367
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,270
She said that's how she finds out my,
uh,

1368
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,730
I schedule.
I don't even talk to my manager.

1369
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,790
He just twitter,
just real talk.

1370
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:51,070
I talked to them occasionally.
Sometimes I'm elusive.

1371
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:53,010
Separate.

1372
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:56,250
Stung a little bit,
huh?

1373
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:58,020
Let's take some questions from the 
field.

1374
01:04:58,021 --> 01:04:58,740
Ladies and gentlemen.

1375
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:04,250
What am I going to educate dana on 
copYright?

1376
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:08,060
Well,
I am a retard,

1377
01:05:08,061 --> 01:05:13,061
I'm not educating anybody on anything 
but copyright law I think is the ufc is 

1378
01:05:14,961 --> 01:05:19,070
threatening to sue all these people to 
take illegal downloads of the.

1379
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,980
Of the same saying,
yeah,

1380
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:24,380
yeah,
they're just doing well.

1381
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,410
They're talking about putting people in 
jail and the threat of that is enough to

1382
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:33,130
make some examples and stuff.
They're going to throw some people in 

1383
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:33,130
what the.
The,

1384
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:34,460
the la guy fit them on clots doors,
the la sheriff,

1385
01:05:34,461 --> 01:05:35,480
whatever.
They're like,

1386
01:05:35,481 --> 01:05:39,850
you're going to shut out all 900.
It goes to shut down a few clothes.

1387
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:45,720
He's right to know who's going to risk 
going to jail or they're just going on 

1388
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,971
the block and there was a dude that.
It was in med school that was a selling.

1389
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:52,790
He was an all licensed and legal and 
everything like that,

1390
01:05:52,791 --> 01:05:54,650
but he decided it was too risky and it's
like,

1391
01:05:54,651 --> 01:05:55,360
you think it's like,
no,

1392
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:57,130
obama won.
It's not.

1393
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:02,200
You never know.
There's a lot of people kind of 

1394
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:02,200
interpret the law.
You know?

1395
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,380
The interesting thing is it's Moving 
along.

1396
01:06:03,381 --> 01:06:06,350
There's a tuesday,
the twelfth or some vote in California.

1397
01:06:06,351 --> 01:06:08,750
It's on the message board where they're 
talking about,

1398
01:06:08,751 --> 01:06:10,040
uh,
trying to,

1399
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:12,650
uh,
vote to move towards legalizing it.

1400
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:16,180
I'm not a registered voter register.

1401
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:21,480
You got to participate in their fake 
game after obama.

1402
01:06:21,570 --> 01:06:25,110
I swear to god.
I thought before obama was in office,

1403
01:06:25,111 --> 01:06:25,890
I was like,
you know what?

1404
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:28,740
This is going to be very different.
We have a black guy,

1405
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,440
he's a liberal.
I'm like the very least,

1406
01:06:31,441 --> 01:06:33,300
it'll be good for the consciousness of 
the country.

1407
01:06:33,301 --> 01:06:38,301
They'll have a leader there,
have someone to look up to that's more 

1408
01:06:38,301 --> 01:06:41,600
peaceful and has their shit together or 
can speak better and it's black and it's

1409
01:06:42,121 --> 01:06:43,800
been through a rough childhood and 
everything,

1410
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:45,440
but he's doing the same ship.
The elder,

1411
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:50,960
he's doing the same exact shit.
It's almost like they have all these 

1412
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:51,090
ideas and then they get into office.
Oh,

1413
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:56,091
it's not as easy to make it happen,
but it's not just go along with things 

1414
01:06:56,091 --> 01:06:59,000
like sending the troops to Afghanistan 
saying it's extra $30,000

1415
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:01,620
at certain points.
He realized what choice do I have?

1416
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:06,620
I can just plug it out,
make it a huge vacuum in this drawer 

1417
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:06,620
itself.
If that's true,

1418
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:10,080
then I realized I could make this 
problem on it's way past the year.

1419
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:11,350
Fuck,
you know,

1420
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,090
well,
not way past,

1421
01:07:12,091 --> 01:07:17,091
but it's certainly more trips,
but they talk about how it would become 

1422
01:07:17,091 --> 01:07:17,091
a hotbed for terrorist.
And we left.

1423
01:07:17,091 --> 01:07:18,420
It's a hot bed now.
It's the whole.

1424
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:23,450
That whole middle east is mad at us.
That whole middle east is mad at us and 

1425
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:27,381
it's like now it's like once you start 
bullying someone and you start pushing 

1426
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:27,840
them,
once they go down,

1427
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:29,760
you got to keep pushing up.
You know,

1428
01:07:29,761 --> 01:07:32,160
that's what's going on right now.
You got to keep them down.

1429
01:07:32,161 --> 01:07:32,900
No,
fuck you gotta.

1430
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:37,910
Keep them now because if they rise up 
and they go get something to eat and 

1431
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:38,130
they take a nap and they come back with 
fresh,

1432
01:07:38,131 --> 01:07:39,690
they're going to punch you in the 
fucking face.

1433
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:40,380
You know,
you're gonna,

1434
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:42,570
you're gonna walk out of a restaurant 
and the guy's going to be right there.

1435
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:44,160
Hey,
I want to talk about what we had to talk

1436
01:07:44,161 --> 01:07:49,161
about earlier.
I heard this thing and here are the 

1437
01:07:49,161 --> 01:07:49,161
people that have been released now and 
that,

1438
01:07:49,161 --> 01:07:49,161
uh,
Yemen,

1439
01:07:49,161 --> 01:07:50,140
um,
and they're worried about them,

1440
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:51,360
you know,
re integrating.

1441
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:55,760
The problem is no one gave them jobs 
there because they're like whatever.

1442
01:07:55,761 --> 01:08:00,761
And they're getting,
becoming disillusioned and leaning on 

1443
01:08:00,761 --> 01:08:01,130
people like ocado and saying,
well help me.

1444
01:08:01,131 --> 01:08:06,131
It's like there's newly being recruited,
like maybe they were wrongly accused 

1445
01:08:06,131 --> 01:08:06,131
before,
but it's like,

1446
01:08:06,131 --> 01:08:09,090
so it's like their life is such shit.
No one gives me the right direction.

1447
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:12,510
They don't just become angry because I 
can't get a job.

1448
01:08:12,511 --> 01:08:14,070
I'm fucking wasted eight years of my 
life.

1449
01:08:14,071 --> 01:08:16,050
What am I supposed to do with someone 
else

1450
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:18,390
is offering you jobs and telling you all
this stuff.

1451
01:08:18,391 --> 01:08:19,140
That sounds right.

1452
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:24,550
A place to live.
Could you fucking imagine,

1453
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:28,390
could you imagine how lucky you are and 
that you were born in the middle of it?

1454
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,650
I bet in plays like a substance only 
comes around once a day.

1455
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:36,550
What was it like?
What must it like to be pregnant?

1456
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,680
To be a pregnant woman living in 
Afghanistan?

1457
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:42,010
How crazy my staff be?
The feeling of vulnerability,

1458
01:08:42,011 --> 01:08:47,011
the constant stress and shaking,
I mean that would be just absolutely 

1459
01:08:47,011 --> 01:08:47,011
horrifying.

1460
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,440
Tuesday,
january 12,

1461
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:56,120
members of California,
that's what they always do.

1462
01:08:56,121 --> 01:09:01,121
Dude.
California assembly will hold the 

1463
01:09:01,121 --> 01:09:01,121
historic vote on statewide marijuana 
policy.

1464
01:09:01,121 --> 01:09:05,870
Members of the public safety committee 
will decide on assembly bill three 90,

1465
01:09:05,871 --> 01:09:10,160
the marijuana control regulation and 
education act,

1466
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:15,310
which seeks to regulate and control the 
production distribution and personal use

1467
01:09:16,011 --> 01:09:19,430
of marijuana for adults older.
All these things are just wide open,

1468
01:09:19,431 --> 01:09:21,230
so it's really open to interpretation.
You know,

1469
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:22,240
no cache,
no.

1470
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:27,250
It's like what?
And then they really want to narrow it 

1471
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:27,250
down.
Now what's legal,

1472
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:30,200
what's not legal,
and if they did open it up illegally,

1473
01:09:30,201 --> 01:09:32,510
statewide,
it wouldn't be much different.

1474
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:36,620
It's very easy to get a recommendation.
The recommendations of the problem,

1475
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:39,180
the taxes was selling the pot while 
there.

1476
01:09:39,190 --> 01:09:42,260
There's always going to be about whether
or not doctors giving us,

1477
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:45,500
but with these guys what they're saying 
is they're trying to legalize it.

1478
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:50,860
This is not about medical.
this is about legalization for personal 

1479
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:51,380
use.
This is a totally different situation.

1480
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,560
They're talking about taxing it and 
trying to make money out of it.

1481
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:59,710
It's a regular to regulate and control 
the production distribution personally.

1482
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:02,690
Yeah.
It's not magical.

1483
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:04,360
They're not talking about medical 
marijuana.

1484
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:09,720
Federally.
Medical marijuana doesn't exist and 

1485
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:09,720
that's,
that's what fucks you.

1486
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:10,570
That's what happened to todd mccormick.
When he got arrested,

1487
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:15,720
he got to court and in court they told 
him that you can't even use the term 

1488
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:15,970
medical marijuana

1489
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:20,090
have wacky is up.
You can't even say it.

1490
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:23,090
You can't even say that I want to.
And you go,

1491
01:10:23,091 --> 01:10:24,980
yes,
I was selling marijuana under,

1492
01:10:24,981 --> 01:10:26,860
you know,
the assumption that you know,

1493
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:29,500
it was legal because proposition to 50.
They don't.

1494
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:31,360
They don't want to hear a fucking word 
of that big.

1495
01:10:31,361 --> 01:10:32,600
Oh,
shut the fuck up.

1496
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:33,970
Were you selling marijuana?
yeah.

1497
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:36,460
Good.
Brody.

1498
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:40,240
What does this cohost tell us?
What is this?

1499
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:42,820
He that means that he can be in a camera
on the side.

1500
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:46,150
His face.
It was this guy bernie stevens.

1501
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:47,230
That's brody,
isn't it?

1502
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:48,430
No,
no,

1503
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,420
nevermind.
Boredom.

1504
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:51,060
Boredom strikes.
What are you blind?

1505
01:10:51,061 --> 01:10:55,390
I am blind now.
Can't I can't go of my rehearsal.

1506
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:57,190
And I was like,
my internet could handle it.

1507
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:58,270
Cohost.
How do you just.

1508
01:10:58,271 --> 01:11:02,020
Somebody gives just anybody but on that.
Well now we know.

1509
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:07,080
Now we know that you can try to comment 
if you have somebody that's going to 

1510
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:07,080
want to be like,
oh yeah,

1511
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:11,251
sure.
It's considered with let's say got a 

1512
01:11:11,251 --> 01:11:11,680
million people were requesting it.
Oh,

1513
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:13,650
then that'll go crazy.
You need direct line.

1514
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:14,050
I think

1515
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,110
eventually everyone's gonna have their 
own reality show.

1516
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,330
That's my,
my vision of the apocalypse.

1517
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,790
is it?
We're all going to have a chat.

1518
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:26,310
We'll all have a channel.
I mean basically that's what we're doing

1519
01:11:26,311 --> 01:11:28,350
right now.
Well once you get the internet,

1520
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:33,000
you could have up to six co where anyone
could have there I think have their face

1521
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:35,920
on the side and you can just mute them.
But if you want to ask him a question,

1522
01:11:35,950 --> 01:11:38,670
you joined him in on the conversation 
but you,

1523
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:41,430
we're waiting on your internet.
Oh shit.

1524
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,550
So we could have like an interview like 
mayhem and stuff like that.

1525
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:47,520
Oh that would be beautiful.
You could have a bunch of people in iT.

1526
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:52,610
We have a bunch of windows and they 
could all open up the different windows 

1527
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:53,190
and they'd be watching all the same time
when we could move it like,

1528
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:58,250
like,
like hollywood squares will go to go to 

1529
01:11:58,250 --> 01:11:58,250
whoopi goldberg.
Right?

1530
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:01,560
What big desktop?
Like overlaid on ms.camp.

1531
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:04,920
We went to see showcase things are 
getting crazy.

1532
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,190
Pretty cool,
right?

1533
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:11,850
Just thinking about 10 years ago you 
couldn't even do something like this.

1534
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:13,920
No,
there was nothing.

1535
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:15,490
There was no twitter,
there was no.

1536
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:20,920
The webcam shows we just blurry pictures
of fucked up girl showing you their 

1537
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,810
pussy and you had to be in their 
membership to get that right.

1538
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:28,120
Slow down.
Those bItches went out of business with 

1539
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:29,340
the internet.
They blossomed those cam girls.

1540
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,410
But then that shit just rotting on the 
vine.

1541
01:12:31,411 --> 01:12:36,411
I say that though because you remember 
when you used to have like that one cam 

1542
01:12:36,411 --> 01:12:38,130
girl and it would be like a whole group 
of people that were all just like,

1543
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,080
look at this.
She's gonna,

1544
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:40,080
you know?
Well you know,

1545
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:41,280
it was really cool.
Is that crazy?

1546
01:12:41,281 --> 01:12:42,630
Amber chick?
She was a really cool.

1547
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:44,850
there was a modern day like,
like,

1548
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:50,480
well this,
this to do real porns her boyfriend do 

1549
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:50,580
porns and put them on the internet.

1550
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:55,580
She didn't give a fuck.
I folloWed this one where it was a girl 

1551
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:58,231
that just had a camera on 24 hours a day
and it was just her and her husband 

1552
01:12:58,231 --> 01:13:00,861
living in New York,
but they would have fucking straight up 

1553
01:13:00,861 --> 01:13:00,861
when they had sex,
they would have sex right on the camera.

1554
01:13:00,861 --> 01:13:03,300
But other than that it was just been 
living their life 24 hours a day.

1555
01:13:03,370 --> 01:13:04,610
Wow.
Holy shit.

1556
01:13:04,611 --> 01:13:06,170
And now she,
uh,

1557
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:11,300
got stopped that and now she's a 
successful author and she's trying to 

1558
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:14,670
raise her past.
No one knows who really did anybody save

1559
01:13:14,671 --> 01:13:19,671
the video of her and her husband.
Fucking google cache is wonders.

1560
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:22,300
And I'm not gonna.
Say her name now.

1561
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:24,300
What'd you say?
Cash wanders.

1562
01:13:24,301 --> 01:13:25,780
Google cash.
Cash.

1563
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:29,010
if you go to google and type in internet
history,

1564
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:34,460
there's a thing that comes up.
I called the wayback machine and you 

1565
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:36,360
could type in your website and see what 
it looked like back in like 1985.

1566
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:37,530
IncredibLe.
Yeah.

1567
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:39,870
Google is fucking,
we were just talking about this,

1568
01:13:39,871 --> 01:13:42,540
me and my tech friend that wire's my 
house.

1569
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:44,820
He was like,
google was like,

1570
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:47,820
they have so much power.
It's almost like if,

1571
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,840
if google were evil,
like we wouldn't even see them coming 

1572
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:53,190
and they document everything.
You know,

1573
01:13:53,191 --> 01:13:55,830
like if there's an artificial 
intelligence out there,

1574
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,780
it's google.
You know,

1575
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,380
google is a weird company man.
I mean there are so powerful.

1576
01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:04,050
If they do terminator,
they do mail,

1577
01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:07,110
they do searching,
they do your fucking maps.

1578
01:14:07,111 --> 01:14:09,450
They do what your house looks like from 
space.

1579
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:14,480
I think longitude is the scariest one,
the one where it just tracks where you 

1580
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,840
are throughout the whole day.
So you could look at it and see like,

1581
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,230
oh I was here,
here,

1582
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,930
here the whole day.
And it records that information,

1583
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,810
puts it in some kind of database to see 
where people are going.

1584
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:24,050
You know.
It's like fuck,

1585
01:14:24,051 --> 01:14:27,010
it's fucking crazy that you would ever 
sign up for that too.

1586
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:30,850
It's fucking crazy man.
The whole google thing.

1587
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,940
But you know,
they seem like a nice company and that's

1588
01:14:32,941 --> 01:14:34,150
why.
That's by the way,

1589
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:38,920
that's why gps on the google phone is 
kind of scary because if you use google,

1590
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,830
what is google doing with that 
information?

1591
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:46,920
Because they could.
There's a way for them to use that 

1592
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:46,920
information.
If you're using your g maps,

1593
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:51,750
you know,
talking about where people are growing 

1594
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:51,750
and when they're going.
Right.

1595
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:51,750
It's,
yeah,

1596
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:54,820
you're running it through google now 
you're running a gps through.

1597
01:14:55,550 --> 01:14:59,050
YOu know what's really Cute though?
What if they were evil and they decided,

1598
01:14:59,051 --> 01:15:01,570
well let's just give a lovable name like
google,

1599
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:02,980
right?
Colorful.

1600
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:08,010
We work really hard and work really hard
on being green and eco conscious and we,

1601
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:11,260
we really pay our employees.
Well they're all swell,

1602
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:14,320
but they're just ruthless monsters.
What if it's the government?

1603
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,710
What if it is to.
That's like area 57 brands.

1604
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:22,920
No shit like developed.
They figured the boycott because of they

1605
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:25,530
sat down,
what have they said

1606
01:15:25,610 --> 01:15:29,240
down and looked at the trends that 
humanity is participating in,

1607
01:15:29,241 --> 01:15:31,480
like look where things are going 
technologically and said,

1608
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:36,500
you know what?
And they got the best scientists on it 

1609
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:36,500
and they said,
this is where we think things are going.

1610
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:37,750
We think things are going to,
uh,

1611
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,450
an online based email service so you can
access it from multiple ports.

1612
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:46,690
We think things are going to.
And they just started listing all these 

1613
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:46,690
things and goals.
Okay.

1614
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:50,540
What if it's people from the future 
making sure we're going along the right 

1615
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:50,540
path?
What if mr.

1616
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:52,140
G's was trying to save us the whole 
time.

1617
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,230
He was just like this butler trying to 
be our friend.

1618
01:15:55,270 --> 01:16:00,270
It was like fucking hell.
I have ounces.

1619
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:09,960
How many hits has asked jeeves get a 
day.

1620
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:11,480
I don't know.
But when remember when.

1621
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:14,160
Remember web crawler?
No,

1622
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:19,400
it used to be like a pre web crawler.
I kind of remember

1623
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:21,510
that now.
Barely.

1624
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:27,050
I don't remember.
I remember realizing that I didn't have 

1625
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:27,870
to get online through aol.
That was a great day.

1626
01:16:27,871 --> 01:16:30,600
Wasn't a lot.
There's another thing I was like,

1627
01:16:30,601 --> 01:16:32,000
oh my god.
But that's like space.

1628
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:35,280
That's like the wilderness,
a browser,

1629
01:16:35,281 --> 01:16:37,110
and I'm going to go on my own and how do
I get my email?

1630
01:16:37,111 --> 01:16:41,330
Now I have to write all that shit into a
program and they get it from the oh wow.

1631
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:44,460
That was for when you first figured out.
You didn't have to use internet explorer

1632
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,830
or firefox or something else.

1633
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:51,700
I just went under date a few months ago.
They finally closed shop.

1634
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:55,410
Isn't it crazy?
Once on top of the world,

1635
01:16:55,411 --> 01:17:00,411
once huge now irrelevant and so quickly 
within a decade gone,

1636
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:04,650
you know,
so much technology and so much.

1637
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:06,910
Some of the things that that were 
invented like,

1638
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:10,160
like cds and just have this really short
life,

1639
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,080
like there's gonna come a point in time 
and no one gives a fuck.

1640
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:17,120
Yeah.
Flash drives hold a fuck load more and 

1641
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:17,120
everything's going to have a usb ports 
shut up.

1642
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:22,300
You know,
It's like cds or like really hot chicks 

1643
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:22,300
that got old.
You know,

1644
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:24,320
like now they have no power or laser 
disc.

1645
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:27,190
Poor lasers,
laser disc full.

1646
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:32,200
It was a big laser disc fan.
He used to have like even when laser 

1647
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,050
disc was dying,
he was buying up really good movies like

1648
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:36,950
terminator,
but it'd be better if it can't be better

1649
01:17:37,010 --> 01:17:42,010
visual quality.
Then blue ray though is not better in 

1650
01:17:42,010 --> 01:17:42,010
blu ray,
but it was better than cd,

1651
01:17:42,010 --> 01:17:42,160
uh,
say hi.

1652
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:45,560
It's kind of like hoW records were 
better than cd,

1653
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:47,030
but it's better than dvd

1654
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,210
image wise.

1655
01:17:48,610 --> 01:17:50,990
Yeah.
but it sounds better too

1656
01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:54,980
on a blue ray.
So insane hd.

1657
01:17:54,990 --> 01:17:59,990
So I was saying anything and you know,
in movies and hd now it's just getting 

1658
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:01,780
so crazy.
This fucking avatar man.

1659
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:03,950
Wait till you see this shit who

1660
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:10,200
like visually it's like whoa.
I didn't even see through a lot of 

1661
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,620
people.
I know it said that they wouldn't go 

1662
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:13,620
back in.
That really lived there.

1663
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:13,620
Whatever.
That's what I said.

1664
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:13,830
I said,
all right,

1665
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:18,840
fuck that feature.
Now that we're going to have fucking 

1666
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:19,790
mask or wires in our brains are like,
pick avatar,

1667
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:20,430
19 years

1668
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:26,440
cold place to go places.
What do I think of coast to coast with 

1669
01:18:27,171 --> 01:18:32,171
art bell.
That's the greatest fucking radio show 

1670
01:18:32,171 --> 01:18:32,171
in the history of the universe,
man.

1671
01:18:32,171 --> 01:18:36,070
They would always,
every now and then it get some lame 

1672
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:36,070
sidekick on target.
Stupid shit.

1673
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:38,660
But for the most part,
it's all people that new big foot and do

1674
01:18:38,661 --> 01:18:40,540
what you used to be werewolves,
but they go.

1675
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:44,900
And by the way,
if you want to know more about what they

1676
01:18:44,901 --> 01:18:46,410
were talking about,
go to ask.

1677
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:47,260
Gee,
it's an answer.

1678
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:50,600
Google conspiracies first link will tell
you all about it.

1679
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:52,490
Oh,
there's a conspiracy side about it.

1680
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:55,030
Conspiracy.
Well see,

1681
01:18:55,031 --> 01:18:57,170
this is the thing.
Great minds think alike.

1682
01:18:57,171 --> 01:18:59,150
Whoever you are out there thinks like us

1683
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:04,390
from November 22nd,
2002 were so lame.

1684
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:08,030
That was eight years ago.
We were Just chilling,

1685
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:10,160
man.
You not believe what I figured out,

1686
01:19:10,161 --> 01:19:15,161
bro.
you fuckinG keeps it cold and last 

1687
01:19:15,161 --> 01:19:18,101
longer.
Fuck it last longer.

1688
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,640
Like growing on it.
Good

1689
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:27,080
for you.
I said if you keep it cold,

1690
01:19:27,081 --> 01:19:32,081
it lasts longer and so dumb.
Of course There had to be a million 

1691
01:19:32,991 --> 01:19:37,991
people.
People think there's a conspiracy and 

1692
01:19:37,991 --> 01:19:37,991
everything.
Those are the nine slash 11 people.

1693
01:19:37,991 --> 01:19:40,640
men did.
Those are hard fucking conversations.

1694
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:41,960
You're.
Here's the conversation.

1695
01:19:41,961 --> 01:19:44,700
It's always like,
but maybe in a night just to nap,

1696
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:47,720
but maybe it doesn't mean anything.
Well,

1697
01:19:47,721 --> 01:19:52,721
the problem Is if it was really,
but maybe I'll have that conversation 

1698
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:52,721
with you,
you know,

1699
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:55,050
if you say maybe the government,
you know,

1700
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:57,500
really arrange that building to be blown
up.

1701
01:19:57,730 --> 01:19:59,280
Maybe bears arranged it,
but,

1702
01:19:59,281 --> 01:20:00,030
but,
but you know,

1703
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:01,550
when,
when someone says maybe,

1704
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:04,550
but the problem is they don't say that 
they go,

1705
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:08,160
maybe the government doesn't give a fuck
you and they plotted

1706
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:11,820
this and they're attached to that idea.
They don't know if it happened.

1707
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:14,330
There's information that I'm not even 
saying it.

1708
01:20:14,331 --> 01:20:16,380
It's like fucking.
Do you believe that it sound like you do

1709
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:18,900
quit saying maybe I think they did this.
Yeah.

1710
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:23,901
But yeah,
I think they Just know that that's a 

1711
01:20:23,901 --> 01:20:23,901
ridiculous argument.
it's too hard.

1712
01:20:23,901 --> 01:20:27,590
Nobody knows what the fuck happened.
But the idea that it was some gigantic 

1713
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:29,550
fucking conspiracy that thousands and 
thousands of people are,

1714
01:20:29,551 --> 01:20:34,551
you know,
I'm not sure that a few people didn't 

1715
01:20:34,551 --> 01:20:37,190
know that something was gonna happen,
but the idea that this many people had 

1716
01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:37,590
to be together and put what the fuck are
you doing?

1717
01:20:37,591 --> 01:20:38,990
I don't know.
My phone jusT started crying.

1718
01:20:40,290 --> 01:20:45,290
Your phone's gay as fuck.
And I'm not going to even say what was 

1719
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:46,570
that?
Oh,

1720
01:20:46,571 --> 01:20:48,550
that's what it was.
An alarm was an along.

1721
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,270
Well,
what song was it not only talking about.

1722
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:54,710
Just tell me I didn't download.
It was alright.

1723
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:58,120
It was a funny lady.
Gaga.

1724
01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:00,930
That is embarrassing.
You hear carmen?

1725
01:21:01,410 --> 01:21:02,680
Carmen,
do you like it?

1726
01:21:06,030 --> 01:21:08,220
Why did your grill put lady gaga on your
phone?

1727
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:13,420
It's my phone connects to my car,
so whenever we getting in car and he's 

1728
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:15,180
like kind of like our jukebox and so she
throws music on my phone all the time.

1729
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:17,400
My girlfriend put another some modern 
day.

1730
01:21:17,401 --> 01:21:22,401
I ran into a wall what?
And ate my homework.

1731
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:25,260
It's fine.
You liked lady gaga?

1732
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:28,170
She,
I appreciate because she can.

1733
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,390
She actually knows how to play our 
instruments and she doesn't live.

1734
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:31,860
She's a real musician.

1735
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:44,090
Oh my god.
All that hermaphrodite talk.

1736
01:21:44,091 --> 01:21:49,091
It's just like,
it's just more playing it up for the 

1737
01:21:49,091 --> 01:21:49,091
media.
Very interesting.

1738
01:21:49,091 --> 01:21:50,120
Very interesting.
How people bite into that.

1739
01:21:50,270 --> 01:21:52,810
That one song though gives me fucking 
brain cancer,

1740
01:21:55,090 --> 01:22:00,090
sarah cart with something that was so 
bad thing on my mind to it later to.

1741
01:22:02,770 --> 01:22:04,970
And then you actually could hear the 
words when he says it.

1742
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:09,250
So it's like there's never been a better
tv show themselves.

1743
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:14,440
Consider funny,
consistent or irreverent consistently 

1744
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:18,281
brilliant.
So they get away with shit that no one 

1745
01:22:18,281 --> 01:22:20,510
get away with that horror off.
When that gay dude stuff.

1746
01:22:20,511 --> 01:22:22,190
ParIs hilton,
asshole,

1747
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:24,410
mr helper.
That's the greatest moment in television

1748
01:22:24,411 --> 01:22:27,290
history as far as I'm concerned.
The fact they even got away with that,

1749
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,870
the fact that they went there,
but that's where you go.

1750
01:22:29,871 --> 01:22:32,060
If you're going to go crazy crazy,
that's where you go.

1751
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:35,990
And then at the end he shoves her up his
ass and wins the contest.

1752
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:38,900
Fuck man.
Can we really put that on tv?

1753
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:42,800
But because of these blocky cartoons,
they got away with it.

1754
01:22:42,801 --> 01:22:44,840
And because comedy central knows that 
they're monsters,

1755
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:47,140
they're Just unstoppable.
People want to watch for.

1756
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:49,730
I don't think comedy central gets to 
tell them what to do at all.

1757
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:50,630
I think.
Well yeah,

1758
01:22:50,631 --> 01:22:52,760
I think there's a lot of that.
I think they're just like,

1759
01:22:52,761 --> 01:22:57,761
shut the fuck.
I think it's not cable.

1760
01:22:58,090 --> 01:22:59,130
It's just them side.
We,

1761
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:00,860
we figured that advertising my pull 
away,

1762
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:06,060
they haven't an article from south park.
They're branding themselves to this 

1763
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:06,300
thing,
so everyone goes knows,

1764
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:11,310
okay,
it might be something like this movie's 

1765
01:23:11,310 --> 01:23:11,380
success behind them,
so and that movie's success.

1766
01:23:11,381 --> 01:23:15,390
Those two big huge films,
those both films were giant successes.

1767
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:19,680
I don't know if they were financially,
but I think they were in America now.

1768
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:22,670
That was one of my favorite movies ever 
and they hate it.

1769
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:24,340
They said that was the hardest movie 
era.

1770
01:23:24,341 --> 01:23:28,330
They will never do that ever again 
because it's really time consuming,

1771
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:33,390
but man,
that was such a great marketing genius 

1772
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:33,390
and I believe that,
that it was really time consuming,

1773
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:36,760
but it was so god damn good.
I got to see the puppets in real life.

1774
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:41,850
Even the silliness that they're really 
the time just kidding catheter because 

1775
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,900
their size are just close the whole 
thing.

1776
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:48,470
Black kittens to be kidding of it with 
the fucking terrorists.

1777
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:52,330
He was the funniest I've ever seen 
before.

1778
01:23:52,331 --> 01:23:57,331
That was probably like the safe sex and 
naked gun when they're covered in 

1779
01:23:57,331 --> 01:23:57,331
rubber,
you know,

1780
01:23:57,420 --> 01:23:59,770
but it's like there's no funny.
That was hilarious.

1781
01:24:00,150 --> 01:24:05,150
OwnIng hardcore,
did you see the unedited version where 

1782
01:24:05,150 --> 01:24:08,191
they dropped blogs on each other?
A pps that wasn't in the movie.

1783
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:14,940
Now they cut it from the movie,
otherwise was to ax pee and poop or no 

1784
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:17,020
go.
So he threw up and never stopped.

1785
01:24:17,021 --> 01:24:21,610
Throwing covered an entire block was so 
funny.

1786
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,900
I remember crying,
laughing.

1787
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:26,410
I couldn't believe how funny it was.
I was like,

1788
01:24:26,411 --> 01:24:29,530
I can't believe they pulled that first 
south park a little bit and I was like,

1789
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:30,310
okay.
We go and I was like,

1790
01:24:30,311 --> 01:24:30,870
wait.
They're saying,

1791
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:36,120
oh my gosh.
they did a musical a musical and I loved

1792
01:24:38,201 --> 01:24:42,040
it and they did a great job,
but how do you do a musical?

1793
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:44,620
That was a genius show.
Blame Canada.

1794
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:46,360
Come on.
How good was that?

1795
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:49,120
How about all the canadians were their 
heads pop off?

1796
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:52,170
She'll say,
I'll look completely weird.

1797
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:57,300
Different heads and totally different 
than just the fact that we accept that 

1798
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:57,300
as a,
hey,

1799
01:24:58,330 --> 01:25:03,070
this is connected and bottle it up and 
that way.

1800
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:04,620
Except that we.
Okay,

1801
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:05,960
that's the head.
There's the head.

1802
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:09,280
That shit's genius.
That shows so goddamn good.

1803
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:12,520
Like I waS looking at a cartoon the 
other day that the one that you gave me,

1804
01:25:12,670 --> 01:25:15,940
the barney rubble picture,
barney rubble doesn't have eyeballs.

1805
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:19,600
No black.
He's tripped out black pupils,

1806
01:25:19,630 --> 01:25:23,020
but everybody else on the show had 
eyeballs because his pupils are black.

1807
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:24,760
Bonnie rubble?
No,

1808
01:25:24,761 --> 01:25:26,610
he's tall white.
It's all white.

1809
01:25:26,770 --> 01:25:27,940
He's got nothing.
I know.

1810
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:34,070
What about what's that?
Are fruity pebbles doesn't have it?

1811
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:35,790
Well,
I think,

1812
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:36,250
well,
I don't know,

1813
01:25:36,251 --> 01:25:41,251
maybe in fruity pebbles yet.
I didn't even know he was off fruity 

1814
01:25:41,251 --> 01:25:41,251
pebbles.
I thought that was bam.

1815
01:25:41,251 --> 01:25:42,370
Bam.
And it's all right.

1816
01:25:43,090 --> 01:25:48,090
It's all the moment.
I think so awful experts and the 

1817
01:25:48,090 --> 01:25:49,030
flintstones pebble,
but it's just weird.

1818
01:25:49,031 --> 01:25:54,031
Like you just,
you just get comfortable with the fact 

1819
01:25:54,031 --> 01:25:54,400
that his face look like that.
So like that.

1820
01:25:54,401 --> 01:25:56,890
This avatar movie,
after an hour,

1821
01:25:56,891 --> 01:25:59,680
I didn't care that chick was blue and 
looked like a lizard.

1822
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:01,910
I still wanted to fuck her.
you went through it?

1823
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:02,940
Yeah,
man.

1824
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:04,160
I wanted to fuck her and which.

1825
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:09,170
And if I lived with them I would know.
But if I lived with them in the woods 

1826
01:26:09,171 --> 01:26:10,550
and shit,
I would totally thinks she was hot.

1827
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:12,230
I totally motherfucker,
you know,

1828
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:13,370
it's like,
it's subjective.

1829
01:26:18,370 --> 01:26:20,900
But if she made a sound other than 
english,

1830
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,700
I wouldn't want to fuck her.
But yeah,

1831
01:26:23,701 --> 01:26:26,360
I love it.
I was a member of the show,

1832
01:26:26,361 --> 01:26:30,710
be the old survey or whatever,
and they started like never watched that

1833
01:26:30,711 --> 01:26:35,711
show.
Which the show I would not watch the 

1834
01:26:37,341 --> 01:26:42,341
news.
This guy wants to know this da seven,

1835
01:26:42,561 --> 01:26:44,330
eight fella.
He wants to know.

1836
01:26:44,331 --> 01:26:47,060
Who do you think is better in bed?
Oprah or hillary clinton?

1837
01:26:47,061 --> 01:26:50,090
Hillary clinton runs you think so that's
a hillary clothes.

1838
01:26:50,091 --> 01:26:54,260
I have a pushy oprah winfrey is a 
fucking huge lesbian.

1839
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:55,570
You think so?
Yes.

1840
01:26:55,640 --> 01:27:00,390
Really their friends more than one who 
thinks like seemed like moral.

1841
01:27:01,610 --> 01:27:02,360
More of a lesbian.

1842
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:03,620
She seems like more.
She made it.

1843
01:27:03,621 --> 01:27:06,380
She didn't know,
but she was sexy and made a human.

1844
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,830
So she knows she.
She's at least accepted dick.

1845
01:27:10,210 --> 01:27:13,310
You have no idea.
We have no idea that steadman guy,

1846
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:15,200
because there was ever a man that looked
like a beard.

1847
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:17,790
That poor.
Fuck dude.

1848
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,520
I bet.
If you google oprah winfrey,

1849
01:27:19,521 --> 01:27:22,550
guys married old ladies,
do conspiracy theory.

1850
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:28,620
I can see it happen.
That's why ellen wanted to be on the 

1851
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:28,620
cover with her.
Well,

1852
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:29,930
she's super powerful,
man.

1853
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:35,560
Maybe.
Maybe she's so powerful that the 

1854
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:35,560
testosterone that she asked for having 
like a billion dollars,

1855
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:39,560
the surge of power that she has maybe 
just made her just want to dominate some

1856
01:27:39,561 --> 01:27:41,210
pitches.
Maybe she doesn't even.

1857
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:43,700
Maybe oprah only gets them to eat her 
pussy.

1858
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:50,880
Her hair.
She doesn't put the shit up,

1859
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:53,600
doesn't do shit.
Is worth a billion dollars and she hangs

1860
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:57,380
out with these brokerages.
That's this oprah.

1861
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:59,770
Do you know how much I believe that's a 
thousand dollars.

1862
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:01,910
Million.
That's incredible money.

1863
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:05,000
That's an insane amount of money.
She's so rich.

1864
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:10,190
Do you couldn't spend that?
You would have to go nutty if you want 

1865
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:11,180
to spend that and she's probably worth 
more than a billion.

1866
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:12,920
She's probably worth several billion.
Right?

1867
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:16,610
So pro fucking winfrey.
She Just kept coming out and new stuff.

1868
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:20,450
No one's been ever been more successful 
than oprah winfrey.

1869
01:28:20,690 --> 01:28:25,690
Like for daytime tv though.
I still remember the old old school.

1870
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:27,530
Oprah.
What's the question?

1871
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:32,560
I love this question.
Let's read it like how he writes it or 

1872
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:32,850
she.
This guy.

1873
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:36,240
Yo,
what's your ethnicity?

1874
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,290
You bond into religion.
Says,

1875
01:28:39,291 --> 01:28:40,640
yo,
whaT's your ethnicity?

1876
01:28:40,641 --> 01:28:43,630
Where you born into a religion?
that's not a bad question if you're 18.

1877
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:51,320
Ashley brio.
Ashley bryan.

1878
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,030
Oh,
so this is what twitter does.

1879
01:28:53,031 --> 01:28:55,100
It doesn't actually scroll.
It just bumps.

1880
01:28:55,270 --> 01:28:57,410
But you know when new people leaving.
Oh it does scroll.

1881
01:28:57,411 --> 01:28:59,430
Look a little better,
but it's really far.

1882
01:29:00,490 --> 01:29:02,010
What do they have to

1883
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:04,620
put hashtags on it and you follow the 
hashtags?

1884
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:06,300
I don't know.
I don't know why it's doing that.

1885
01:29:06,301 --> 01:29:08,490
That's what I was looking at earlier.
They'll put in the hashtags on,

1886
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:10,770
is that what it is?
No.

1887
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,530
Hashtag.
That's exactly what it is,

1888
01:29:14,531 --> 01:29:17,640
is hashtags,
but why is it doing that?

1889
01:29:17,641 --> 01:29:22,641
That's weird.
But why isn't it doesn't have a little 

1890
01:29:22,641 --> 01:29:22,641
app style?
What does it mean?

1891
01:29:22,641 --> 01:29:23,010
Does it mean they're in this twitter 
room?

1892
01:29:23,011 --> 01:29:26,700
Is that what it is?
Check my iphone.

1893
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:32,270
A young hillary clinTon.
What do you think young hillary clinton 

1894
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:32,270
was?
Was cool.

1895
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:34,320
Adam.
The first time we ran it was like,

1896
01:29:34,321 --> 01:29:39,321
no,
I don't think by then she she'd had a 

1897
01:29:39,361 --> 01:29:41,130
child.
Who would you rather fuck now?

1898
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:43,600
Is that the story that you think is 
better and better?

1899
01:29:43,601 --> 01:29:46,140
I question,
but it wasn't hillary.

1900
01:29:47,070 --> 01:29:48,660
Hillary,
hillary would give you some actioN.

1901
01:29:48,661 --> 01:29:50,120
Whereas oprah would make it either 
pushing.

1902
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:55,160
Hillary would have better cocaine.
I'm just not july.

1903
01:29:56,950 --> 01:29:58,650
That's what oprah would winfrey really 
did.

1904
01:29:58,651 --> 01:30:01,020
She just had girls eat her pussy.
That's hilarious.

1905
01:30:01,021 --> 01:30:06,021
They came out just like tiger woods 
coming out that he's a freak and he's 

1906
01:30:06,021 --> 01:30:09,321
married with children,
but it's really banging like 16 

1907
01:30:09,321 --> 01:30:09,360
different chicks at the same time.
what if it came out that oprah winfrey,

1908
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:14,390
it's just crazy bitch that just has all 
these young girls eat her pussy and 

1909
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:14,390
they're all blindfolded.

1910
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:20,810
They bring it into a special room so 
they don't know who's putting their 

1911
01:30:20,810 --> 01:30:20,810
writing.
Like,

1912
01:30:20,810 --> 01:30:20,970
this is your rule.
This is your assignment.

1913
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:24,540
You will be paid $125,000
a month.

1914
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:25,830
Will you accept?
You know,

1915
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:28,800
you keep getting that much.
You'd have to give him 125 a year,

1916
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:30,600
but she,
she will call upon,

1917
01:30:30,601 --> 01:30:32,490
you know,
got more than that.

1918
01:30:32,491 --> 01:30:35,490
If you Want to be like not blindfold and
just go into a room,

1919
01:30:35,491 --> 01:30:40,491
they eat your pussy hundred 25 a year 
and still be on call at all times on 

1920
01:30:40,930 --> 01:30:44,220

That's too much.

1921
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:46,050
You can retire.
I can't keep you.

1922
01:30:46,051 --> 01:30:48,740

take someone who's super broke.

1926
01:30:59,510 --> 01:31:03,510

1927
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:08,780

1931
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,250

Not letting them leave.

1935
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:28,830
It's like hollywood.
You can never ever get to a certain 

1936
01:31:28,830 --> 01:31:32,121
point.
You have to be cultivating other boys 

1937
01:31:32,121 --> 01:31:32,121
and getting used to the mother's slave.
Reforestation.

1938
01:31:32,121 --> 01:31:36,611

You get them used to the money and then 

1939

The keys

1946
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:03,330

Hackers here,

1947
01:32:03,410 --> 01:32:05,230
you see her for you.
Totally.

1948
01:32:05,231 --> 01:32:10,231
Right.
So the competition and being a male 

1949
01:32:10,231 --> 01:32:12,181
whore.
You know in Nevada they just recently 

1950
01:32:12,181 --> 01:32:14,200
approved male horse.
They're going to have nail horrors for.

1951
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:17,530
No apparently didn't.
Apparently it was only females.

1952
01:32:18,490 --> 01:32:19,840
What?
That's crazy.

1953
01:32:19,841 --> 01:32:22,820
Why would they not have it?
That seems.

1954
01:32:23,630 --> 01:32:24,970
That's interesting.
I don't know.

1955
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:27,220
It doesn't seem worse.
This is the wait,

1956
01:32:27,230 --> 01:32:28,540
wait guys.
For society,

1957
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:31,280
if guys think they're fred is gay,
they're going to get them a male horn.

1958
01:32:31,281 --> 01:32:32,820
Now I'm like,
dude,

1959
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:37,830

1961
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:43,860
Get the fuck outta here.
That'd be a nice moment because you're 

1962
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:43,860
like,
oh,

1963
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:43,860
I've got to fake it with this girl from 
my friends.

1964
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:48,710
Sure.

1965
01:32:49,340 --> 01:32:52,290
Imagine you get an award.
The bunny ranch is going to go,

1966
01:32:52,291 --> 01:32:53,410
and I wrote,
what is,

1967
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:55,000
what does she look like?
Don't worry.

1968
01:32:55,001 --> 01:33:00,001
You're going to Like it to send them in 
there and then the red light comes on.

1969
01:33:00,391 --> 01:33:01,970
It's a naked guy with a heart on.
It's like,

1970
01:33:03,670 --> 01:33:08,670
oh my god,
could you imagine what that is going to 

1971
01:33:08,670 --> 01:33:08,670
be?
The guy says,

1972
01:33:08,670 --> 01:33:12,850
what the fuck?
You know that he's just a little femi.

1973
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:18,130
Please quit wearing sweaters.
My dad had a friend when I was growing 

1974
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:18,880
up,
I would have swore this dude was gay,

1975
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:20,840
but he wasn't gay.
It was just a little friendly.

1976
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:22,840
Yeah.
It's like,

1977
01:33:22,841 --> 01:33:24,700
look,
if you didn't know duncan trussell,

1978
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,230
there are times when duncan trussell

1979
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:31,440
can I ask family,
but I just think that I couldn't act 

1980
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,510
serious and normal stuff like that,
but I just always let myself like,

1981
01:33:33,511 --> 01:33:34,780
who cares,
you know?

1982
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:35,180
Yeah.
No,

1983
01:33:35,181 --> 01:33:35,540
no,
no,

1984
01:33:35,541 --> 01:33:35,890
no,
no,

1985
01:33:35,891 --> 01:33:37,000
no.
You're not understanding me.

1986
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:38,860
That's not me.
That's relaxed.

1987
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:41,000
This guy was like,
god,

1988
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:44,470
I kind of famous.
People are always gay.

1989
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:45,520
Really?
Well,

1990
01:33:45,521 --> 01:33:46,930
can you just go into it?
Yeah.

1991
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:50,780
Why is it doing hashtags?
And that's a better question.

1992
01:33:51,430 --> 01:33:53,630
Why It works.
That's fucked up,

1993
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:55,280
dude.
To try to fix it now.

1994
01:33:55,281 --> 01:33:57,340
I don't want to fuck anything up,
but I'll try it.

1995
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:59,980
Does anyone know why it's doing hashtags
instead?

1996
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:04,550
The signs in the twitter.
Social stream on ustream?

1997
01:34:04,610 --> 01:34:09,610
Yeah,
because they're socializing about the 

1998
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:09,610
subject.
yeah.

1999
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:10,100
Well it's last week.
Last week I did at signs and that's what

2000
01:34:10,101 --> 01:34:12,680
we want.
We don't want this hashtag bullshit.

2001
01:34:13,790 --> 01:34:18,200
Anyone know how to change shape from two
hash hash tags to add signs.

2002
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:21,280
I'm still doing the same thing.
Duncan trussell is awesome.

2003
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:22,930
yes.
Duncan trussell is awesome.

2004
01:34:23,170 --> 01:34:25,780
When he goes,
he's really just playing fucking legs.

2005
01:34:25,781 --> 01:34:27,280
Girls.
trust me.

2006
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:34,320
What's that red van?
the karma grip.

2007
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:36,100
Done dunkelman.
He's technically a comic.

2008
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:39,190
He had go up anytime he wants.
He wants to fuck around.

2009
01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:41,950
He's very funny.
Actually wrote some good materIal.

2010
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:43,130
We have to get it.
Uh,

2011
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,310
when we're going to.
I can't tell you about that.

2012
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:47,630
I'm just going to tell them about the 
show thing.

2013
01:34:47,770 --> 01:34:49,640
Can't tell you what though.
But uh,

2014
01:34:49,930 --> 01:34:52,720
he's done it a bunch of times.
It's just doing these videos even though

2015
01:34:52,721 --> 01:34:54,160
it doesn't seem like it takes a lot of 
time.

2016
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,950
It takes a lot of fucking time.
And he's got an archive.

2017
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,140
This god damn materials

2018
01:34:58,150 --> 01:35:01,100
doing open mic sucks ass that to the 
product he,

2019
01:35:01,101 --> 01:35:06,101

sold out shows and I'm like a newb 

2020

but you get spoiled and then you have to

2021
01:35:08,001 --> 01:35:13,001

front of like three other comics,
you know,

2023
01:35:13,001 --> 01:35:14,780

you can have,

2024
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,600
you know,
five minutes on stage.

2025
01:35:17,601 --> 01:35:18,450
It sucks.
Yeah.

2026
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:19,720
Open mic.
So that shit.

2027
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:21,550
I'm too old for that.
You know,

2028
01:35:21,551 --> 01:35:23,360
they're brutal.
It's a little warm.

2029
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:24,380
Yeah.

2030
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:25,460

2032
01:35:30,580 --> 01:35:32,810
change the hashtag or are they all doing
it?

2033
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:37,840
They're all putting it in.

2040
01:35:56,490 --> 01:36:01,490

Addison's.

2065
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:59,310
I'm looking forward to that.
I fucking love Texas.

2066
01:36:59,970 --> 01:37:02,180
How much fun is Texas?
I love Texas.

2067
01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:07,210
So much fun.
I'm looking at those dates on like 

2068
01:37:07,210 --> 01:37:07,210
templates.
Going to be a lot of fun.

2069
01:37:07,210 --> 01:37:08,110
Always is an ice house is always a lot 
of fun.

2070
01:37:08,111 --> 01:37:10,980
But my man will go,
you know,

2071
01:37:11,220 --> 01:37:14,480
it's like the food's a little better.
The people were a little more fun.

2072
01:37:14,481 --> 01:37:17,930
It's a little more rowdy.
It's like the like healthier.

2073
01:37:17,931 --> 01:37:22,931
There's something about them to like,
they got something that we don't have 

2074
01:37:22,931 --> 01:37:23,040
here in California.
This,

2075
01:37:23,130 --> 01:37:26,210
this place is so polluted By the 
entertainment business,

2076
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:31,280
but yet I hate the east coast.
East coast to angry.

2077
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:32,310
Yeah.
why?

2078
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:34,250
Why is it so angry?
So fucking mad.

2079
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:36,110
You know,
I grew up witH a lot of guys like that.

2080
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:41,140
Always in everyone's insulting and 
they're usually the funniest guys 

2081
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:42,800
because they have to learn quickly to 
deal with,

2082
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:44,210
you know,
people's bullshit.

2083
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:46,280
But boston,
boston,

2084
01:37:46,290 --> 01:37:49,550
so fucking agra.
So many aggro guys.

2085
01:37:50,260 --> 01:37:51,500
Yeah.
Everybody's upset.

2086
01:37:51,501 --> 01:37:54,470
Everybody wants to fight in New York.
How could he?

2087
01:37:54,770 --> 01:37:56,170
I can't living around

2088
01:37:56,170 --> 01:37:58,780
that many people's rough.
So many people.

2089
01:37:58,781 --> 01:38:02,320
It's someone saiD just this guy t saps 
said because it's cold.

2090
01:38:02,470 --> 01:38:06,940
That is definitely part of it.
Boston is cold as fuck in the winter.

2091
01:38:07,270 --> 01:38:12,270
I was there in october and when I was 
there in october it was starting to be 

2092
01:38:12,270 --> 01:38:12,700
freezing cold.
It was like 50,

2093
01:38:12,701 --> 01:38:17,701
but it was a different kind of 50.
It wasn't like la 50 is nothing january 

2094
01:38:18,850 --> 01:38:22,780
when we're wearing shorts in january out
here all the time.

2095
01:38:23,020 --> 01:38:25,090
But a grown man,
I really should never wear shorts.

2096
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:27,160
Look at my legs,
bitch.

2097
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:31,990
So my legs all sexy and and shit.
When I get gray hair on my legs,

2098
01:38:31,991 --> 01:38:36,991
that's when you stopped seeing him in 
shorts or you'll see me in shorts with 

2099
01:38:36,991 --> 01:38:37,240
shaved legs.
SeemeD like you fucking faggot.

2100
01:38:37,270 --> 01:38:40,970
The might just remind your legs.
Shaved them.

2101
01:38:41,060 --> 01:38:44,120
no,
I'm not gonna die.

2102
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:46,240
I know dudes who do their facial hair.

2103
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:47,680
Facial hair.
But I don't.

2104
01:38:47,730 --> 01:38:49,520
I don't do that.
I'm going to shave.

2105
01:38:49,930 --> 01:38:54,930
I shaved my balls.
I don't dye my ball here so I'm not 

2106
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:54,930
going to die my leg here either.
Right?

2107
01:38:55,130 --> 01:38:56,470
It can't be dying to your leg.
Hair.

2108
01:38:56,471 --> 01:39:01,020
That's just fucking faggot tree line in 
a bathtub with some fucking black gang.

2109
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:03,490
Trying to pretend you're not dying.
You're dying.

2110
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:05,320
You don't die.
You fucking leg hair.

2111
01:39:05,330 --> 01:39:10,330
That's hilarious.
And have you ever seen like an old dude 

2112
01:39:10,330 --> 01:39:12,691
who's hair is dyed?
They have like a reddish tint to the 

2113
01:39:12,691 --> 01:39:14,971
hair dye.
Looks kind of brown instead of a blonde 

2114
01:39:14,971 --> 01:39:15,100
base.
Could you imagine if you have it on your

2115
01:39:15,101 --> 01:39:17,020
legs and your legs looked like sasquatch
legs?

2116
01:39:17,021 --> 01:39:21,550
Ginger,
ginger,

2117
01:39:21,551 --> 01:39:24,100
sasquatch?
Who is red band?

2118
01:39:24,101 --> 01:39:26,050
What does he do?
Red band is the guy who,

2119
01:39:26,051 --> 01:39:27,870
if you ever saw the carlos when see a 
video,

2120
01:39:27,970 --> 01:39:30,970
you've seen his work,
have you seen the jew clam video?

2121
01:39:30,970 --> 01:39:34,270
You've seen his work and if you haven't,
you really need to check that out.

2122
01:39:34,271 --> 01:39:39,271
Google jus clam and look away tHe um,
he's.

2123
01:39:40,410 --> 01:39:42,750
He does all the videos for um,
for me,

2124
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:44,420
for my website and for,
you know,

2125
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:49,440
we just,
it's like one of the things we do when 

2126
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:49,440
we,
uh,

2127
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:53,610
we go on these um,
these shows and we traveled all these 

2128
01:39:53,610 --> 01:39:54,760
different towns.
One of the things we do is we,

2129
01:39:54,820 --> 01:39:59,820
a lot of funny shit happens and we film 
it and brian takes all that funny ship 

2130
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:04,310
has to watch nine hours of bullshit to 
get 10 minutes of awesome this and so 10

2131
01:40:06,371 --> 01:40:11,371
minutes have fun and with the right 
music and the right editing and he just 

2132
01:40:11,371 --> 01:40:12,520
makes these cool ass videos.
I just heard some directors

2133
01:40:12,530 --> 01:40:17,530
we're talking about shot this movie with
julia more than 21 days and the editing 

2134
01:40:17,530 --> 01:40:19,430
to five months,
they thought it would take said 10 or 12

2135
01:40:19,431 --> 01:40:19,880
weeks.
He goes,

2136
01:40:19,881 --> 01:40:24,881
I'll be finishing five to seven to five 
months because that's so much longer to 

2137
01:40:24,881 --> 01:40:24,881
make a joke.
Funny.

2138
01:40:24,881 --> 01:40:26,270
You can make a joke.
Not funny.

2139
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:27,970
Oh,
you do whatever you want with editing.

2140
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:30,810
I can'T even imagine.
Should I hate dealing with.

2141
01:40:30,811 --> 01:40:34,020
Is this just the music?
Because I make my videos around music,

2142
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:39,080
but then if I pick a song that will get 
me banned off youtube and off all these 

2143
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:43,161
websites,
then fox and then you have to like try 

2144
01:40:43,161 --> 01:40:43,650
to do with your own music or make your 
own kind of shit.

2145
01:40:43,651 --> 01:40:45,840
That's.
And then you lose the creativity part.

2146
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,050
You're working with bullshit instead of 
working with led zeppelin.

2147
01:40:49,051 --> 01:40:49,660
You know,
it's,

2148
01:40:51,010 --> 01:40:51,960
I hate it.
I know.

2149
01:40:51,961 --> 01:40:55,130
It's like one of martin scorsese's best 
movies.

2150
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:58,670
good fellows.
Do you remember the scene where um,

2151
01:40:58,870 --> 01:41:01,720
uh,
where it was all falling apart for a,

2152
01:41:01,790 --> 01:41:06,790
what's his face or tell them that he was
driving in the car and look at the music

2153
01:41:09,770 --> 01:41:12,610
was so important to,
to all that shit immediately.

2154
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:15,020
It's all that rolling stone shit,
you know?

2155
01:41:15,410 --> 01:41:16,540
I mean,
it was like you.

2156
01:41:16,690 --> 01:41:17,620
That was that

2157
01:41:18,550 --> 01:41:19,110
when he,
when he,

2158
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:21,030
when he put in,
when he's,

2159
01:41:21,210 --> 01:41:22,710
when he's picking up his mail or 
whatever,

2160
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:27,890
or the newspaper and they have a,
we did it my way by my vicious and 

2161
01:41:27,890 --> 01:41:27,890
whatever,
but he was like,

2162
01:41:27,890 --> 01:41:30,510
that's a reason he just,
he's not using the sinatra version.

2163
01:41:30,660 --> 01:41:33,960
He's on purpose.
He wants the fucking that version of it,

2164
01:41:33,961 --> 01:41:36,330
this bastardized version of the mafia 
they're trying to show.

2165
01:41:36,331 --> 01:41:36,840
It's like,
yes,

2166
01:41:36,841 --> 01:41:37,440
it's important.

2167
01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:42,980
Yeah.
So music is so important to a good 

2168
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:43,160
movie.
All those.

2169
01:41:43,170 --> 01:41:46,140
That's one of the great things about 
like scorsese tarantino.

2170
01:41:46,230 --> 01:41:47,850
Yeah.
Francis ford coppola.

2171
01:41:47,910 --> 01:41:49,860
They know how to pick the right fucking 
music.

2172
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:51,930
You know,
the great guys,

2173
01:41:52,050 --> 01:41:54,630
they know how to really jazz it up.
Right.

2174
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:56,110
And all those good.
The bad,

2175
01:41:56,111 --> 01:41:58,080
the ugly.
This world surgery alone,

2176
01:41:58,090 --> 01:42:00,220
it always use of more pony or whatever 
his name was.

2177
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:03,300
The good,
the bad and the ugly.

2178
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:06,970
I wish I knew had a dj like remix and 
stuff like that.

2179
01:42:06,990 --> 01:42:11,990
Like because you watched,
it seems like it's so much fun and then 

2180
01:42:11,990 --> 01:42:11,990
you make your own music and that's,
you know,

2181
01:42:12,090 --> 01:42:13,200
in a way,
you know,

2182
01:42:13,201 --> 01:42:14,100
in a way.
Yeah.

2183
01:42:14,150 --> 01:42:19,150
And I just wish I could do that.
You what's weird that a guy gets through

2184
01:42:19,621 --> 01:42:21,720
and is huge.
Like there's that guy,

2185
01:42:21,721 --> 01:42:26,640
I think his name was t esto.
He's a gigantic dj and these people were

2186
01:42:26,641 --> 01:42:31,641
telling me this dude was telling me that
he went to a [inaudible] concert on new 

2187
01:42:31,641 --> 01:42:36,110
years and it was like this big thing.
I think he did it in south America and 

2188
01:42:36,110 --> 01:42:37,520
he said it was insane.
It was really crazy more and they're all

2189
01:42:37,521 --> 01:42:42,521
in accessing other craziness.
Hundred thousand people on ecstasy and 

2190
01:42:44,011 --> 01:42:46,620
this guy is janet and this guy gets.

2191
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:51,180
Apparently he liked this multimillion 
selling dj guy.

2192
01:42:51,810 --> 01:42:52,800
I don't know where they make their 
money.

2193
01:42:52,801 --> 01:42:54,400
I guess they make their money on 
personal appearances.

2194
01:42:55,760 --> 01:43:00,760
Just sounds so good.
Whatever excess nightclubs in it makes 

2195
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:00,760
it sound like,
oh yeah,

2196
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:03,360
I get it,
but if they're good man,

2197
01:43:03,361 --> 01:43:05,700
ecstasy,
I only did it once,

2198
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:08,550
but god damn it feel good.
It's just named right.

2199
01:43:08,610 --> 01:43:09,560
It was like a kind of feel.
Yeah,

2200
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:11,520
you got it.
It felt so good,

2201
01:43:11,670 --> 01:43:13,620
but it scared the shit out of me the 
next day.

2202
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:16,770
The next data.
I never got rid of those.

2203
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:21,920
I might've had shitty ecstasy.
I might have to get me some good extra 

2204
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:22,590
step and see what happens,
but it might be my biochemical.

2205
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:24,550
I think it's more of a,
you know,

2206
01:43:25,530 --> 01:43:30,530
possible djs produced music,
but they produced music that's like 

2207
01:43:31,921 --> 01:43:36,921
other people's music that they're like 
piecing it together and making it their 

2208
01:43:36,921 --> 01:43:39,360
own but is an art to it for sure.
You know,

2209
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:44,780
sometimes the people that make the music
don't see it as well as someone who's 

2210
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:46,050
listening to the music,
you know,

2211
01:43:46,051 --> 01:43:47,130
I,
I know that sounds crazy,

2212
01:43:47,131 --> 01:43:52,131
but it's possible that a dj could take a
song that wasn't really that good and 

2213
01:43:52,131 --> 01:43:54,600
make pretty fucking dope.
And that's possiblE.

2214
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:55,950
Sometimes remixes are better than the 
original songs,

2215
01:43:56,010 --> 01:43:56,400
you know,

2216
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:02,380
most of the time it is like,
like if you go to a party band or what's

2217
01:44:02,381 --> 01:44:05,680
that other dude's a girl talk.
If you go download some of their music,

2218
01:44:05,681 --> 01:44:10,681
they take some really good songs.
But mainly listen to a mixed up and 

2219
01:44:10,681 --> 01:44:10,840
stuff like that.
I actually like that better.

2220
01:44:11,860 --> 01:44:16,860
Well,
that's what everybody says about like 

2221
01:44:16,860 --> 01:44:16,860
quintin tarantino,
right?

2222
01:44:16,860 --> 01:44:17,690
That his themes are all stories from 
like other movies and it.

2223
01:44:18,130 --> 01:44:21,370
But he makes them fucking bad ass.
You know?

2224
01:44:22,290 --> 01:44:27,290
That's an interesting little fine line.
Now kick paris seven,

2225
01:44:31,941 --> 01:44:32,480
eight,
nine one.

2226
01:44:32,481 --> 01:44:37,481
We're having a fight in here.
This dude is telling someone to kick 

2227
01:44:37,481 --> 01:44:37,481
somebody off.

2228
01:44:37,481 --> 01:44:37,780
Oh,
paris.

2229
01:44:37,810 --> 01:44:39,060
because paris keeps on saying,
hey,

2230
01:44:39,110 --> 01:44:42,970
soup mcculloch joe you want to do is 
suck my cock ribbons together.

2231
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:44,830
How much money do you have fellow?

2232
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:50,580
You think that's the real?
Is paris hilton to do it?

2233
01:45:00,740 --> 01:45:03,020
Yes.
I want to ban the sender.

2234
01:45:03,550 --> 01:45:04,510
Cool.
Bam.

2235
01:45:04,511 --> 01:45:07,990
Sorry bitch.
Nobody's getting their cock sucked now.

2236
01:45:08,170 --> 01:45:09,520
I was really.
What I was going to do is suck.

2237
01:45:09,521 --> 01:45:10,960
Everybody's cocked.
That was listening,

2238
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:13,040
but you had to go and fuck it up.
So.

2239
01:45:13,210 --> 01:45:14,890
And I didn't know joey diaz was here.
Oh,

2240
01:45:15,370 --> 01:45:20,370
that's already going deep nowadays are 
just going deep.

2241
01:45:24,490 --> 01:45:29,490
Remember the old red?
That would smoke half a hit and then 

2242
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:29,490
like in a car accident on that way

2243
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:35,130
we're getting to hogwan stage.
You got barbecued in vegas.

2244
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:36,930
How?
How'd you get to vegas?

2245
01:45:37,390 --> 01:45:39,120
Cool.
You kept going.

2246
01:45:39,570 --> 01:45:42,810
We had a joint and usually does this.
The way it works when to do comedy.

2247
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:44,910
One hit.
This should be fun.

2248
01:45:44,970 --> 01:45:47,130
It'll be fun to get loose two heads.
So like,

2249
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:48,690
ooh,
you're trusting,

2250
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:52,950
trusting the universe and you're 
trusting your state of mind.

2251
01:45:53,190 --> 01:45:55,260
We had four heads.
We were.

2252
01:45:55,261 --> 01:45:59,910
We were fucking blitzkrieg.
Pop him on more.

2253
01:46:00,150 --> 01:46:01,620
We were fucking blitzkrieg.

2254
01:46:01,870 --> 01:46:04,120
The worst is when I was so stoned like 
that.

2255
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:09,130
My first week out here.
You invited me to go see you at fear 

2256
01:46:09,130 --> 01:46:09,130
factor set.
Oh,

2257
01:46:09,130 --> 01:46:09,690
that's right.
He gave me these,

2258
01:46:09,910 --> 01:46:10,800
these,
these are like,

2259
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:15,770
hey Ohio boy brian,
come here.

2260
01:46:16,010 --> 01:46:17,470
You want this out?
Lollipop.

2261
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:22,480
I'm like all sure.
And so I take it and then like 10 

2262
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:22,480
minutes later is like,
you feel anything yet?

2263
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:22,480
And I'm like,
no,

2264
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:25,370
let's take another one.
So I took the second one.

2265
01:46:25,371 --> 01:46:27,560
Yes.
we take two and in joe's like,

2266
01:46:27,561 --> 01:46:32,561
well,
here is hanging out with all the 

2267
01:46:32,561 --> 01:46:33,971
directors and producers in this trailer.
I got to go now and then it starts 

2268
01:46:33,971 --> 01:46:34,420
tripping and I'm like,
they're like,

2269
01:46:34,830 --> 01:46:35,900
oh no,
they're going.

2270
01:46:36,290 --> 01:46:39,900
And they're like,
like he was so,

2271
01:46:40,010 --> 01:46:42,070
so yeah,
it was holding

2272
01:46:42,580 --> 01:46:44,840
was I called you old ablo for like three
months.

2273
01:46:47,690 --> 01:46:51,550
That's how much I hated fear factor.
I hated fear factor so much that I,

2274
01:46:51,551 --> 01:46:54,980
I had to do it,
that I would get barbecued.

2275
01:46:55,450 --> 01:46:59,110
I would get so fucking hot.
I would take these crazy,

2276
01:46:59,111 --> 01:47:04,111
uh,
beyond bomb that was the name of the 

2277
01:47:04,111 --> 01:47:04,111
company that would make them lollipops 
or to eat one of those.

2278
01:47:04,111 --> 01:47:08,701
Before I would do fear factor,
I'd be blitzkrieg to the point where I 

2279
01:47:08,701 --> 01:47:13,141
could remember what I was talking to 
about 10 seconds ago and that's how I 

2280
01:47:13,141 --> 01:47:13,141
would do the show.

2281
01:47:13,550 --> 01:47:18,550
Made it so much more interesting.
It's fun to watch fear factor now 

2282
01:47:18,550 --> 01:47:21,221
knowing that though,
because like all the episodes you can 

2283
01:47:21,221 --> 01:47:21,221
tell your eyes are all glazed over.
He was lIke,

2284
01:47:21,221 --> 01:47:21,221
oh my god,

2285
01:47:23,510 --> 01:47:28,510
they're the.
The producers knew it and liked that 

2286
01:47:28,510 --> 01:47:29,640
fact that I did it because it made me 
more relaxed and uh,

2287
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:33,930
there were so many agro douche bags and 
then show producers there must work with

2288
01:47:33,931 --> 01:47:35,900
so many,
so many.

2289
01:47:37,070 --> 01:47:39,330
And if you want to get through she can 
make a lot of miserable.

2290
01:47:39,890 --> 01:47:42,630
There was most of the people that did 
that show were really cool.

2291
01:47:42,631 --> 01:47:44,850
They were there to have fun trying to 
win some money.

2292
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,140
Holy shit.
I'm on tv.

2293
01:47:46,220 --> 01:47:49,200
You know,
there was a few like stars.

2294
01:47:49,410 --> 01:47:50,520
Yeah.
They got douchey.

2295
01:47:50,550 --> 01:47:52,690
Well not only have they got aggressive,
you know,

2296
01:47:52,691 --> 01:47:57,691
there was,
there was some contestants that will 

2297
01:47:57,691 --> 01:47:57,691
like real aggressive,
you know,

2298
01:47:57,691 --> 01:48:01,631
and that was annoying because they were 
all hyped up trying to win this fucking 

2299
01:48:01,631 --> 01:48:02,480
show and they would start shit with me.
You know,

2300
01:48:02,530 --> 01:48:05,100
they're at home in jersey practicing and
joe rogan shit.

2301
01:48:05,130 --> 01:48:08,970
There's one more suited him,
so I don't really say it,

2302
01:48:08,971 --> 01:48:12,070
but they're already wrapped up by the 
time they get there.

2303
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:12,870
I'm like,
hey man,

2304
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:14,690
relax.
I'm here to help you.

2305
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:19,620
So the weed helps with that.
The weed helps.

2306
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:24,640
Nothing.
Nothing helps you deal with aggression 

2307
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:24,640
better than we'd hoped for.
Gifts.

2308
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:24,640
Sometimes the people that watCh it.
Oh,

2309
01:48:24,770 --> 01:48:26,610
right there.
So I'm very nice.

2310
01:48:27,540 --> 01:48:30,730
Was that the vegas show?
Last may says a dune.

2311
01:48:31,430 --> 01:48:33,270
Dune,
john d,

2312
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:35,240
you and jan.
I know we were talking about.

2313
01:48:35,510 --> 01:48:37,170
Yeah,
we're talking about saturday night,

2314
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:39,270
friday night the,
um,

2315
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:42,000
we do the house of blues and vegas all 
the time.

2316
01:48:42,001 --> 01:48:47,001
We also do the palms and uh,
I'm going to be doing that like every 

2317
01:48:47,001 --> 01:48:47,370
couple months we're going to do that.
The palms more?

2318
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:49,580
Yeah.
Why later?

2319
01:48:49,590 --> 01:48:51,600
But yeah,
just more regular.

2320
01:48:51,630 --> 01:48:52,940
More of a club.
Yeah,

2321
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:54,290
I think so too.
And if it's similar,

2322
01:48:54,310 --> 01:48:57,150
the other stuff and it's set up that 
way.

2323
01:48:57,170 --> 01:49:02,170
Yeah.
It's the only thing I don't like about 

2324
01:49:02,170 --> 01:49:02,400
the poems is that the stage lighting,
it's not the best.

2325
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:04,290
The house of blues is all like really 
lit up well,

2326
01:49:04,291 --> 01:49:06,660
but they might have fixed that.
I know that's not a big fix.

2327
01:49:06,690 --> 01:49:08,550
Just a spotlight,
but yeah.

2328
01:49:08,551 --> 01:49:10,290
So either way we're going to be in vegas
a lot.

2329
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,510
Talk about mma.
Joe.

2330
01:49:12,511 --> 01:49:16,030
Fuck mark gaining.
Oh that's john copenhagen.

2331
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:17,590
I want,
if that's the real john copenhagen,

2332
01:49:17,980 --> 01:49:21,750
that's the war machine would have.
Is that the real market and ah,

2333
01:49:21,751 --> 01:49:23,470
that's cool.
Real john copenhagen.

2334
01:49:23,590 --> 01:49:26,970
The war machine wouldn't have a fucking 
little tweety bird next to him.

2335
01:49:27,270 --> 01:49:32,270
What does that with those tweety birds?
A Yellow in the picture because they 

2336
01:49:32,270 --> 01:49:34,190
just joined or there a lot of ufc guys 
warm.

2337
01:49:34,191 --> 01:49:36,600
Shane's got a pIcture of him looking all
bought off on it.

2338
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:47,020
The palms has the naked girl pick 
onstage.

2339
01:49:47,090 --> 01:49:48,200
Yes.
That is.

2340
01:49:48,201 --> 01:49:48,980
Yeah,
exactly.

2341
01:49:48,981 --> 01:49:51,290
When you're on stage of the palms,
right to your left.

2342
01:49:51,291 --> 01:49:56,291
There's a naked picture.
There's a picture of a girl showing her 

2343
01:49:56,291 --> 01:49:56,291
pussy with the new workplace.
Yeah.

2344
01:49:56,291 --> 01:50:01,190
She's got her tits,
her out and she's like showing a little 

2345
01:50:01,190 --> 01:50:01,190
bit of pubic hair.
Red onstage and.

2346
01:50:01,190 --> 01:50:05,870
Oh,
because the playboy and the playboy 

2347
01:50:05,870 --> 01:50:05,870
comedy club.
Yeah.

2348
01:50:05,870 --> 01:50:07,670
It's very strange man.
But I think we're going to do that.

2349
01:50:07,730 --> 01:50:09,500
I didn't want to do that much more to 
the next one.

2350
01:50:09,501 --> 01:50:10,490
We're doing that in february.

2351
01:50:10,590 --> 01:50:14,820
Is there any female comics that you know
of that show their pussy all the time?

2352
01:50:14,890 --> 01:50:17,410
Like,
like joy chosen?

2353
01:50:18,310 --> 01:50:19,430
Any?
No,

2354
01:50:20,430 --> 01:50:21,240
that'd be awesome.
Yeah,

2355
01:50:21,241 --> 01:50:22,570
that's a problem.
God's like,

2356
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:24,550
oh Yeah.

2357
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:30,010
There's nothing funny about a girl show 
and her pussy dude pulls his dick out.

2358
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:30,790
Well,
what?

2359
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:33,130
That's funny.
Like,

2360
01:50:33,140 --> 01:50:38,140
look,
I'm fingering myself with my cell phone 

2361
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:41,990
or what happened when you were young?
What happened?

2362
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:45,750
Sarah silverman.
sarah silverman.

2363
01:50:46,620 --> 01:50:48,510
But she wouldn't be fun if she showed 
her pussy.

2364
01:50:48,680 --> 01:50:49,830
She's funny.
She talks about it,

2365
01:50:51,330 --> 01:50:56,330
but if she showed it she killed.
I did that k rock thing with her last 

2366
01:50:56,330 --> 01:50:56,330
year.
There was like a.

2367
01:50:56,330 --> 01:50:57,910
I'm like,
well,

2368
01:50:57,911 --> 01:51:00,900
there's sOme k rock comedy use.
alaris crushed.

2369
01:51:00,901 --> 01:51:02,970
God damn.
She crushed it.

2370
01:51:03,060 --> 01:51:07,190
She's funny man to do,
to do that.

2371
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:08,880
And I was walking to.
Yeah,

2372
01:51:08,881 --> 01:51:11,880
he's hilarious.
That guy's a really good one,

2373
01:51:11,900 --> 01:51:13,660
right?
I've always seen that starbucks.

2374
01:51:14,570 --> 01:51:16,760
He's always with his kid.
He's like being dad.

2375
01:51:17,150 --> 01:51:18,830
Mr dad and stuff with the kids family.

2376
01:51:19,210 --> 01:51:19,600
He.
Oh,

2377
01:51:19,601 --> 01:51:22,270
he always surprises me with where he 
goes with his writing.

2378
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:24,460
I really like his writing,
you know,

2379
01:51:24,790 --> 01:51:25,350
his,
um,

2380
01:51:25,630 --> 01:51:30,630
his stuff.
He'll go someplace and he'll take a 

2381
01:51:30,630 --> 01:51:33,511
premise that like you would think like 
maybe you would like think about like 

2382
01:51:33,511 --> 01:51:35,980
maybe I'll talk about this on stage and 
then go ask funny enough,

2383
01:51:36,620 --> 01:51:39,480
but he makes it fun to actually make the
Joke out of it.

2384
01:51:39,540 --> 01:51:44,540
yeah.
He beat it down and conforms it and 

2385
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:45,610
makes it funny with his writinG.
He always takes shit to a place.

2386
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:48,400
I'm always surprised.
come to seattle.

2387
01:51:48,401 --> 01:51:51,070
I'm going to come to seattle 
motherfucker eventually.

2388
01:51:53,670 --> 01:51:56,050
Is it better to change the.
I don't know.

2389
01:51:56,590 --> 01:52:00,030
I've not heard good again,
but this is a stupid way to,

2390
01:52:00,070 --> 01:52:02,620
to see this because these hashtags 
things.

2391
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,830
ThIs was stupid.
Well,

2392
01:52:05,831 --> 01:52:08,290
because it keeps growing and they can't 
fucking read it.

2393
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:11,200
At least when you go to actual twitter,
it doesn't do that.

2394
01:52:13,030 --> 01:52:13,360
Oh,

2395
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:20,540
we have to go to actual twitter.
You can actually sit there and stop it.

2396
01:52:21,190 --> 01:52:23,690
I'm not looking at hashtags.
I'm just looking at that.

2397
01:52:23,691 --> 01:52:25,100
Um,
that app thing.

2398
01:52:25,101 --> 01:52:26,690
Now I'm going to just look at that.
Now.

2399
01:52:26,750 --> 01:52:27,470
Can we do that?

2400
01:52:29,990 --> 01:52:33,770
What happened with dreams thinking if 
that's how he's doing it.

2401
01:52:33,950 --> 01:52:37,160
I think eastern's thinking if there's 
alternative people that do the hashtag,

2402
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:39,340
theY don't show up as a trending topic.
Yeah.

2403
01:52:39,850 --> 01:52:41,410
Here's a good question.
Salvia.

2404
01:52:41,470 --> 01:52:43,450
Have you ever done it?
Brian's done.

2405
01:52:43,451 --> 01:52:44,800
Salvia.
You have videos on.

2406
01:52:44,801 --> 01:52:46,750
Did have a video already?
I did it once.

2407
01:52:47,050 --> 01:52:48,560
Did you put a video up?
If you do that?

2408
01:52:48,890 --> 01:52:49,490
Brian does.

2409
01:52:51,490 --> 01:52:52,150
Was alex

2410
01:52:53,620 --> 01:52:55,350
super cool.
It just of tripping out.

2411
01:52:55,530 --> 01:52:59,490
You're on top of a house is looking at 
people's lawns or something like that.

2412
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:04,500
Bags on my on my childhood long could 
feel that reality here and the other 

2413
01:53:06,131 --> 01:53:11,131
reality it went like this and I've been 
right here at the real reality here and 

2414
01:53:11,131 --> 01:53:12,370
I was trying to like not make them 
overlap because I'll never come back.

2415
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:13,930
I was like,
no,

2416
01:53:13,950 --> 01:53:15,670
no,
I'm not there.

2417
01:53:15,700 --> 01:53:17,360
It's not credible.

2418
01:53:17,410 --> 01:53:22,410
I thought my face became carpet and then
it melted and tore off and then I went 

2419
01:53:22,410 --> 01:53:24,090
down a water slide and then I was like,
are you talking about.

2420
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:28,230
You're talking about my face.
How crazy is that?

2421
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:32,340
That's legal.
Salvia is illegal in some places is it's

2422
01:53:32,341 --> 01:53:35,400
actually turning illegal now a couple of
places.

2423
01:53:35,790 --> 01:53:36,690
FlorIda.
Yeah,

2424
01:53:36,691 --> 01:53:38,710
but there's 50 states,
lord.

2425
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:41,490
I'm going to make it illegal now.
Pretty fast though.

2426
01:53:41,550 --> 01:53:44,490
I think they just did seven states 
recently or something like that.

2427
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:50,280
Damn,
this,

2428
01:53:50,300 --> 01:53:51,570
this,
the mark gaydon,

2429
01:53:51,571 --> 01:53:54,030
whoever you are.
Gonna block.

2430
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:55,670
You see?
Yeah.

2431
01:53:55,770 --> 01:53:56,760
You talked too much.

2432
01:53:57,340 --> 01:53:59,270
So Mark Hayden?
I don't think so.

2433
01:53:59,271 --> 01:54:00,990
It's a fake one.
Now.

2434
01:54:01,050 --> 01:54:01,490
What's real?

2435
01:54:02,430 --> 01:54:03,670
It's real marketing.
It's real.

2436
01:54:03,790 --> 01:54:08,790
wow.
Just like the cheaters is woman 

2437
01:54:08,790 --> 01:54:08,790
canadian.
Alicia says,

2438
01:54:08,790 --> 01:54:11,490
were they all on lollipops also the 
contestants?

2439
01:54:11,690 --> 01:54:16,690
No,
I've got the contestants high on meth 

2440
01:54:16,690 --> 01:54:19,910
because you want to have a good show.
You want to have a good motIvated group 

2441
01:54:19,910 --> 01:54:23,841
of people out there trying to compete.
So they said it was common knowledge 

2442
01:54:23,841 --> 01:54:24,590
that the set supplied.
No,

2443
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:24,940
I'm making.

2444
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:27,970
Hey,
have you ever seen this?

2445
01:54:28,190 --> 01:54:30,580
No one was on any drugs.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2446
01:54:30,581 --> 01:54:33,060
they were british style book for years 
and uh,

2447
01:54:33,330 --> 01:54:34,450
we gave him a diet coke

2448
01:54:34,540 --> 01:54:39,540
can,
you can have a water if you wanted that 

2449
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:41,181
too.
Or you could have a regular coke if you 

2450
01:54:41,181 --> 01:54:41,310
don't give a fuck.
But no,

2451
01:54:41,311 --> 01:54:46,311
there was no.
Now the contestants who weren't on 

2452
01:54:46,311 --> 01:54:46,311
drugs,
it was just me.

2453
01:54:46,311 --> 01:54:50,331
I was,
I'm a little bit Of weed to try to get 

2454
01:54:50,331 --> 01:54:50,331
through the day

2455
01:54:50,331 --> 01:54:53,920
you ever.
That puts you with gray pubic hair yet 

2456
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:53,920
in real life.
How not in real life have you?

2457
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:55,600
No,
really not yet,

2458
01:54:56,790 --> 01:54:58,470
but one day that's all we're going to be
seeing.

2459
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:01,110
One day you're going to be like,
why'd you start shaving your pussy?

2460
01:55:01,111 --> 01:55:06,111
Shut up.
I wAnt to talk about that green or gray 

2461
01:55:06,111 --> 01:55:06,111
10.
Yeah.

2462
01:55:06,111 --> 01:55:08,070
It's going to always look dusty.
Oh no.

2463
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:12,910
Something on it is that you're going to 
be able to see the ingrown hair

2464
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:24,040
of the knees and elbows.
What other mma rules we like to see on 

2465
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:24,950
it?
I don't know.

2466
01:55:24,951 --> 01:55:29,951
You know,
I think that should be up to a vote 

2467
01:55:29,951 --> 01:55:29,951
with.
They should allow rural new knees on the

2468
01:55:29,951 --> 01:55:30,680
ground,
stuff like that.

2469
01:55:30,681 --> 01:55:35,510
I think in a certain there's a certain 
part about knees on the ground and kicks

2470
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:40,540
or the cage.
You can't get away from them In certain 

2471
01:55:40,540 --> 01:55:40,550
places so that it becomes where you get 
trapped up against the cage.

2472
01:55:40,551 --> 01:55:42,770
Dudes are going to take damage that theY
wouldn't normally take.

2473
01:55:42,930 --> 01:55:47,930
Whereas like if they did it in a ring,
the thing about the ring is you could 

2474
01:55:47,930 --> 01:55:51,291
slide out of that bitch,
you can get your head under it and just 

2475
01:55:51,291 --> 01:55:52,500
avoid the kicker could instead of having
to stop right on.

2476
01:55:52,580 --> 01:55:54,480
Yeah,
you can't get trapped there.

2477
01:55:54,481 --> 01:55:56,760
I mean you kind of get trapped in the 
turn buckle,

2478
01:55:58,110 --> 01:55:59,040
but not the same.

2479
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:00,900
It's,
there's openings all over the place.

2480
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:06,020
What about having a warning tracker on 
the cage and you can't kick somebody in 

2481
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:06,150
the head on the ground inside that 
warren truck.

2482
01:56:06,210 --> 01:56:09,390
That's a good idea to go baseball 
looking.

2483
01:56:09,391 --> 01:56:11,640
You just thought it.
That's a real good idea right there.

2484
01:56:11,641 --> 01:56:16,641
Ladies and gentlemen,
the warning track around the knees on 

2485
01:56:16,641 --> 01:56:18,810
the ground are not effective and so what
you do is you grab a guy,

2486
01:56:18,811 --> 01:56:23,811
get him in a fucking hold and you pull 
them into the middle of the nail on the 

2487
01:56:23,811 --> 01:56:26,280
head niamh on the ground maybe.
Yeah,

2488
01:56:26,281 --> 01:56:27,900
that would.
That's actually a smart move.

2489
01:56:28,140 --> 01:56:31,110
That would make it really interesting.
More strategies.

2490
01:56:31,290 --> 01:56:32,730
People trying to go to that warning 
track.

2491
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:34,950
I think that people will be excited 
about that too.

2492
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:35,900
You know,
like the nea,

2493
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:37,410
the nea,
and you're near the uh,

2494
01:56:37,411 --> 01:56:40,350
the knee area in the middle.
It's like,

2495
01:56:40,351 --> 01:56:41,220
oh shit,
just in the middle.

2496
01:56:41,221 --> 01:56:42,420
What's it going to do?
We can't go anywhere.

2497
01:56:42,421 --> 01:56:43,890
It's going to be in the.
Yeah.

2498
01:56:43,891 --> 01:56:44,910
And people would talk shit.
Well,

2499
01:56:44,911 --> 01:56:47,460
he was real smart and stayed away from 
the need area.

2500
01:56:47,461 --> 01:56:52,461
I was like,
fuck them up in that knee if you're 

2501
01:56:52,461 --> 01:56:54,150
scared my strength show.
Well he didn't want to bang with me.

2502
01:56:56,570 --> 01:56:58,400
They didn't want to with me.
Oh,

2503
01:56:58,470 --> 01:56:59,900
fucking shut.
He wanted to fight.

2504
01:57:00,470 --> 01:57:05,400
Didn't want to do,
do,

2505
01:57:05,450 --> 01:57:06,690
do,
do.

2506
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:10,350
This guy says in the past broadcast with
ufc,

2507
01:57:10,351 --> 01:57:15,351
with guest announcers you find that 
limits your broadcasting or messes with 

2508
01:57:15,351 --> 01:57:15,850
chemistry now?
No.

2509
01:57:15,860 --> 01:57:17,250
You know,
those guys were nice guys.

2510
01:57:17,251 --> 01:57:20,610
I did it once with craig hummer and once
with a vascular surgeon.

2511
01:57:20,940 --> 01:57:22,710
They're both nice guys.
Very professional,

2512
01:57:22,730 --> 01:57:24,700
you know,
but go burst my,

2513
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:25,830
you know,
he's a good buddy.

2514
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:27,270
We're friends.
We're real good friends.

2515
01:57:27,271 --> 01:57:30,270
So I liked having him around.
It's fun and I think he's excellent.

2516
01:57:30,350 --> 01:57:32,100
what he does.
That shit's very hard.

2517
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:35,400
That I received bill hicks live be 
frederick 30.

2518
01:57:35,401 --> 01:57:40,401
Yeah,
some of a couple of times I saw him in 

2519
01:57:40,401 --> 01:57:43,191
la when he was just like,
just starting to be known.

2520
01:57:44,070 --> 01:57:45,870
It was fun.
I saw him clear room.

2521
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:47,130
I saw him bomb.

2522
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:48,730
He went up after this,
uh,

2523
01:57:48,870 --> 01:57:53,250
this really hacky guy and the guy was 
doing all these impressions of different

2524
01:57:53,251 --> 01:57:55,560
cartoon characters,
smoking weed and it was just,

2525
01:57:55,890 --> 01:58:00,890
he's a nice guy,
but it was just really hacky stuff when 

2526
01:58:00,890 --> 01:58:02,961
the audience was eating it up and hicks 
went on afterwards with all this George 

2527
01:58:03,390 --> 01:58:07,200
Bush war,
John Davidson,

2528
01:58:08,140 --> 01:58:11,430
she coming out of oprah winfrey's asks 
when oprah winfrey's all.

2529
01:58:11,740 --> 01:58:13,230
No,
it wasn't an oprah winfrey who was a,

2530
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:15,300
he would,
he would do it with a bunch of different

2531
01:58:15,301 --> 01:58:16,830
people.
But anyway,

2532
01:58:16,860 --> 01:58:21,860
he has these crazy fucking bits and 
social commentary and the audit is 

2533
01:58:21,860 --> 01:58:25,320
getting up in giant chunks.
They were getting up like 10,

2534
01:58:25,321 --> 01:58:26,970
15 people at the time.
They left,

2535
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:31,140
they abandoned him and he was just 
eating it onstage onstage,

2536
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:36,170
but we were loving it.
It was like me and maybe like seven or 

2537
01:58:36,170 --> 01:58:40,770
eight other comics was bombing better 
than I'd ever seen anybody bomb.

2538
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:42,580
He was bombing like a Champion,

2539
01:58:42,970 --> 01:58:45,070
like you didn't give a fuck.
He's taking a shit,

2540
01:58:45,071 --> 01:58:47,290
right?
He's doing this bit where I said I don't

2541
01:58:47,291 --> 01:58:49,050
remember who the.
He did one.

2542
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:51,640
sometimes you have to do it with,
with oprah winfrey.

2543
01:58:51,641 --> 01:58:54,570
I don't think that was over this time,
but it was like that,

2544
01:58:55,870 --> 01:58:58,600
that uh,
she shits out John davidson,

2545
01:58:58,810 --> 01:59:00,790
so I forget how it goes.
But it was a really funny.

2546
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:03,550
John davidson was the host of that 
incredible.

2547
01:59:04,750 --> 01:59:05,790
Yeah.
What's that?

2548
01:59:05,830 --> 01:59:07,930
Maybe it was the devil fuck John 
Davidson.

2549
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:10,010
So anyway,
she's in the middle.

2550
01:59:10,210 --> 01:59:12,520
He's in the middle of squattinG down on 
stage,

2551
01:59:12,521 --> 01:59:16,420
just making these moaning noises that 
he's taking a shit and he's doing it for

2552
01:59:16,421 --> 01:59:18,510
like a minute.
Like he's like,

2553
01:59:22,100 --> 01:59:27,100
yeah,
that usually clears her own and then it 

2554
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:28,180
goes back to it and he did it like 
without any,

2555
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:31,960
there was no feeling that he was self 
conscious.

2556
01:59:32,230 --> 01:59:34,030
It waS like a feeling like,
oh yeah,

2557
01:59:34,210 --> 01:59:34,960
and fuck it.

2558
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:36,370
It wasn't like,
holy shit,

2559
01:59:36,371 --> 01:59:41,371
I'm bombing.
It was like he was making fun of it and 

2560
01:59:41,371 --> 01:59:41,371
it was,
it was awesome.

2561
01:59:41,371 --> 01:59:41,650
It was,
it was really,

2562
01:59:41,651 --> 01:59:46,651
really interesting to watch.
It was like the best I'd ever seen 

2563
01:59:46,651 --> 01:59:46,651
anybody bomb,
but we,

2564
01:59:46,651 --> 01:59:50,341
like I said,
we laughed our asses off and I seen him 

2565
01:59:50,341 --> 01:59:52,531
kill too.
I saw him kill a couple of times out of 

2566
01:59:52,531 --> 01:59:54,901
the common connection with all his.
A jimi hendrix is jimi hendrix.

2567
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:59,140
When debbie gibson was famous,
jimmy hendrix running into debbie gibson

2568
01:59:59,141 --> 02:00:00,730
at the mall.
So yeah,

2569
02:00:00,731 --> 02:00:02,890
it was really loud and it was funny 
stuff.

2570
02:00:03,010 --> 02:00:04,570
He was a lot like,
I'm like,

2571
02:00:04,571 --> 02:00:09,571
sam kennison a lot.
Why kinison like you could tell like 

2572
02:00:09,571 --> 02:00:09,880
that they,
they work together,

2573
02:00:10,270 --> 02:00:15,270
you know,
and dudes work together as much as we 

2574
02:00:15,270 --> 02:00:17,401
try not to.
We pick up a little piece of each 

2575
02:00:17,401 --> 02:00:17,401
other's styles.
Yeah,

2576
02:00:17,401 --> 02:00:17,980
yeah,
totally.

2577
02:00:17,981 --> 02:00:19,830
And it's part of it is like,
I dunno,

2578
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:22,660
it's like we all say powerful,
right?

2579
02:00:22,720 --> 02:00:23,490
You know why?
Why?

2580
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:25,990
So why do we all say powerful?
Because my friend larry,

2581
02:00:26,110 --> 02:00:28,570
because larry said malaria was the 
original powerful.

2582
02:00:28,750 --> 02:00:30,730
So you got to give credit to the 
originaL powerful.

2583
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:34,670
But everybody says powerful.
It's like it's out there.

2584
02:00:34,730 --> 02:00:35,940
It's nobody's now.
No.

2585
02:00:35,950 --> 02:00:37,030
One second.
They're it.

2586
02:00:37,650 --> 02:00:38,320
Exactly.

2587
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:46,920
Exactly.
Rad is a perfect example or anything 

2588
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:48,250
like that.
There's like something thAt's hot.

2589
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:51,280
It just becomes a part of the 
vernacular.

2590
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:53,260
Huge,
huge,

2591
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:54,550
all that shit to,
to,

2592
02:00:54,551 --> 02:00:59,551
to niche and when that happens.
But that's the original powerfuls larry.

2593
02:01:00,130 --> 02:01:05,130
But anyway,
my point is that bill hicks and 

2594
02:01:05,130 --> 02:01:05,130
kennison,
uh,

2595
02:01:05,130 --> 02:01:06,220
I don't know which came first.
The chicken or the egg.

2596
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:10,690
I don't know who was influencing hill.
I know kennison was the godfather common

2597
02:01:10,700 --> 02:01:15,700
in houston.
He was the guy that made everybody want 

2598
02:01:15,700 --> 02:01:15,700
to do comedy.
He was the guy that was the,

2599
02:01:15,700 --> 02:01:20,390
the leader of the outlaws.
And hicks was clearly like his 

2600
02:01:20,390 --> 02:01:21,400
underlying.
But if you look at like the writing,

2601
02:01:21,401 --> 02:01:23,410
like hicks's writing are so much 
different,

2602
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:26,140
you know,
there were so different,

2603
02:01:26,230 --> 02:01:26,740
you know,
when they,

2604
02:01:26,741 --> 02:01:31,741
when they,
they both developed into their own 

2605
02:01:31,741 --> 02:01:31,741
thing.
You know,

2606
02:01:31,741 --> 02:01:34,420
hicks always had to like say something,
whereas kinison was just fucking,

2607
02:01:34,450 --> 02:01:36,610
we're here for fun.
We're here to party.

2608
02:01:36,611 --> 02:01:40,070
We're here for chaos.
Go with

2609
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:42,350
the kennedy center.
Anywhere you've got to take.

2610
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:43,640
Yeah,
I definitely,

2611
02:01:43,720 --> 02:01:48,370
he'd have to say I did it with jokes.
Like I think that life keeps fucking you

2612
02:01:48,371 --> 02:01:49,750
in the ass.
Oh.

2613
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:50,650
It was like,
wow,

2614
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:52,890
you can't say better or you really felt 
about life.

2615
02:01:53,130 --> 02:01:58,130
Can't say better.
That was an awesome one and the one on 

2616
02:01:58,130 --> 02:01:58,130
the starving children in those 
commercials.

2617
02:01:58,130 --> 02:02:02,770
Come on.
That's one of the greatest comedy bits 

2618
02:02:02,770 --> 02:02:04,611
in the history of the universe when he's
doing that bit about those kids 

2619
02:02:04,611 --> 02:02:04,611
starviNg.
I'm like,

2620
02:02:04,611 --> 02:02:05,520
well,
what do you want me to feed them?

2621
02:02:05,521 --> 02:02:09,750
Why don't you feed them?
You're right fucking now that it's like,

2622
02:02:10,200 --> 02:02:12,090
don't feed them.
Settle people like me.

2623
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:17,600
Is that a p seven people that are going 
to go there and tell you that we 

2624
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:18,840
wouldn't have to come here 5,000
miles with your food.

2625
02:02:18,841 --> 02:02:19,470
A few people live.

2626
02:02:23,060 --> 02:02:24,810
There's no windshield thoughts.
The tester

2627
02:02:25,290 --> 02:02:26,640
come here and let the fucker.
No,

2628
02:02:26,770 --> 02:02:30,150
this is that.
He was going to be a thousand years from

2629
02:02:30,151 --> 02:02:31,040
now.
Fuck it.

2630
02:02:31,041 --> 02:02:33,840
Sand.
We got deserts in America too.

2631
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:35,680
We just don't live it.
I'm an to ask

2632
02:02:38,210 --> 02:02:39,980
when you go.
God damn.

2633
02:02:40,550 --> 02:02:41,630
I mean,
when I first saw that,

2634
02:02:41,631 --> 02:02:46,631
I was like,
that's the greatest comedy I've ever 

2635
02:02:46,631 --> 02:02:46,631
seen ever.
this is completely not caring,

2636
02:02:46,631 --> 02:02:50,830
just didn't give a fuck and there was no
one like it because I grew up in like 

2637
02:02:51,650 --> 02:02:56,650
when I first heard kinison,
I was living in the really conservative 

2638
02:02:56,650 --> 02:02:56,990
boston,
really religious.

2639
02:02:57,080 --> 02:03:00,590
Everyone waS either catholic or jewish.
Very conservative,

2640
02:03:00,591 --> 02:03:02,780
lot of angry people,
but also very conservative.

2641
02:03:02,781 --> 02:03:05,630
You never heard shit like that.
Nothing.

2642
02:03:06,020 --> 02:03:08,720
Never heard.
People have the balls to talk like that.

2643
02:03:08,721 --> 02:03:11,420
Even when your friends are around,
you're all by yourselves.

2644
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:13,400
You don't have the balls to talk that 
crazy.

2645
02:03:14,180 --> 02:03:15,770
So to hear someone like that and you're 
like,

2646
02:03:15,771 --> 02:03:20,090
whoa.
He changed comedy.

2647
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:22,380
He's one of those guys that came on and 
change comedy.

2648
02:03:23,140 --> 02:03:27,760
There was nobody like that beforehand.
He was a total original,

2649
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:29,300
a young comedian,
special.

2650
02:03:29,301 --> 02:03:29,820
When you See

2651
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:31,640
it was on it,
a couple other guys,

2652
02:03:31,670 --> 02:03:36,670
but nelson or whatever his name was and 
it was like either you've seen him come 

2653
02:03:36,670 --> 02:03:36,800
on and you're like,
oh,

2654
02:03:36,860 --> 02:03:41,120
it's all going to be that from now on.
It's all way anymore.

2655
02:03:41,150 --> 02:03:41,930
Yeah,
they were fine.

2656
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:44,420
They were all good,
but he was just so raw,

2657
02:03:44,510 --> 02:03:49,510
so much energy,
so much power and what he was saying 

2658
02:03:49,510 --> 02:03:50,750
made so much.
there's also real.

2659
02:03:51,390 --> 02:03:53,020
Yeah.
It wasn't like this is.

2660
02:03:53,290 --> 02:03:56,300
That was the same one with bob nelson.
Bob nelson,

2661
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:58,670
yeah.
Let me put balloons in here.

2662
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:02,660
it's my impression of a football player 
and he runs up and it's like,

2663
02:04:02,680 --> 02:04:04,700
all right,
that's thing you did,

2664
02:04:04,730 --> 02:04:07,040
but you don't.
Yeah,

2665
02:04:09,250 --> 02:04:10,810
it's not.
It wasn't as good.

2666
02:04:12,210 --> 02:04:14,470
Wouldn't do in cancer.
And did that joke about jesus,

2667
02:04:14,950 --> 02:04:19,950
you think jesus is coming back?
I think the last words we ever heard 

2668
02:04:19,950 --> 02:04:19,950
from jesus or

2669
02:04:19,950 --> 02:04:19,950
oh,

2670
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:27,630
that whole screaming style,
that powerful style.

2671
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:29,580
I mean that's my favorite kind of 
comedy.

2672
02:04:29,581 --> 02:04:31,200
like joey diaz when he's mad,

2673
02:04:31,370 --> 02:04:36,370
that is fucking screaming at you when 
he's getting fucking crazy fuckers 

2674
02:04:37,410 --> 02:04:38,110
fuckers kill

2675
02:04:38,110 --> 02:04:40,460
osama bin.
Ladin killed George Bush.

2676
02:04:40,710 --> 02:04:41,490
I'll fucking.
I'll.

2677
02:04:41,491 --> 02:04:44,040
She'll call me brian.
$5.

2678
02:04:44,610 --> 02:04:48,030
Kill them all.
I liked them.

2679
02:04:48,620 --> 02:04:51,190
I liked them all.
Feed retarded shit too,

2680
02:04:51,191 --> 02:04:52,110
but I'm like,

2681
02:04:53,370 --> 02:04:56,390
that's a beautiful thing about comedy is
you can't tell someone how to do comedy,

2682
02:04:56,410 --> 02:04:58,490
right?
Nobody can do it correctly.

2683
02:04:58,750 --> 02:05:03,500
Just everybody's got their own way.
Comedy is just a nutty fucking art forum

2684
02:05:03,501 --> 02:05:05,570
now.
Everybody's got a different way of doing

2685
02:05:05,571 --> 02:05:08,090
it in every way works.
You know,

2686
02:05:08,120 --> 02:05:11,020
like if mitch hedberg was trying to do 
is act like kinison,

2687
02:05:11,240 --> 02:05:13,520
that'll be crazy.
But if kennedy was trying to do is.

2688
02:05:13,521 --> 02:05:15,230
I've got mitch heDberg,
like what?

2689
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:20,440
I wonder if there's any footage of old 
old bitch hedberg right when I started 

2690
02:05:20,440 --> 02:05:21,970
doing open mics and I was trying to do 
like a little boy from comedy developed.

2691
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:27,020
It will be really interesting to see how
well have you seen the um,

2692
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:30,530
larry the cable guy videos.
that's incredible.

2693
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:35,920
Dan whitney that's got larry the cable 
guy is the most successful standup 

2694
02:05:40,431 --> 02:05:41,990
comedian and the history of the world.

2695
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:46,790
No one's even close as far as live gate 
sales.

2696
02:05:47,090 --> 02:05:50,370
He sells out like football arena,
football arena.

2697
02:05:50,371 --> 02:05:51,800
It was like 50,000
people.

2698
02:05:51,980 --> 02:05:56,980
Josh wolfe opens for him.
They get on a giant stage and a fucking 

2699
02:05:56,980 --> 02:05:57,140
football arena.
Dude,

2700
02:05:57,620 --> 02:06:00,830
that's crazy.
He had pictures of it on his phone.

2701
02:06:00,831 --> 02:06:02,210
He was showing him the pictures.
He was like,

2702
02:06:02,211 --> 02:06:03,350
look man,
this is the audience.

2703
02:06:03,630 --> 02:06:04,250
And you look at it,
y'all,

2704
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:09,320
what the fuck?
That's like a world you're doIng it for 

2705
02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:13,211
like you're doing as a country.
How do you connect with all those 

2706
02:06:13,211 --> 02:06:13,730
fucking peanuts?
Color jokes?

2707
02:06:14,120 --> 02:06:15,680
Slowly.
I don't know,

2708
02:06:15,681 --> 02:06:20,681
man.
Do you think you could connect with all 

2709
02:06:20,681 --> 02:06:20,681
those people?
No.

2710
02:06:20,681 --> 02:06:21,860
No.
I bet you that with our full charismatic

2711
02:06:21,861 --> 02:06:23,950
motherfucker,
they would have to really like you to.

2712
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:27,110
To connect with all those beautiful 
facial expressions are so far back.

2713
02:06:27,290 --> 02:06:32,290
It's true because the only thing is that
they would have to have some big ass 

2714
02:06:32,290 --> 02:06:32,290
screen.
I'm sure they'll have a.

2715
02:06:32,290 --> 02:06:37,130
But football arenas are primarily their 
outdoor things right there.

2716
02:06:37,460 --> 02:06:39,290
There was never covered,
covered.

2717
02:06:39,291 --> 02:06:41,590
Sometimes heated.
Sometimes there's just not the time.

2718
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:46,130
Sometimes we needed up there.
If they're indoors in minneapolis,

2719
02:06:46,190 --> 02:06:50,590
the metro community,
it's like 30 below zero and I was like,

2720
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:55,600
I have outside of green bay,
have outside 30 below zero people go to 

2721
02:06:55,600 --> 02:06:55,970
the game.
Never cancel football games.

2722
02:06:59,480 --> 02:07:01,580
Football games or a mother fuckers.
Man,

2723
02:07:01,581 --> 02:07:06,500
when you see those have no shirt on.
He ended up nuts.

2724
02:07:06,510 --> 02:07:08,750
Mad.
There's something cool about that.

2725
02:07:09,050 --> 02:07:14,050
There's something,
if you want to talk about a sport that 

2726
02:07:14,050 --> 02:07:14,330
really does represent America,
that represents America,

2727
02:07:15,230 --> 02:07:20,230
that's a crazy ass fucking sport.
They will play even if it's pouring 

2728
02:07:20,230 --> 02:07:20,230
rain.
Oh,

2729
02:07:20,230 --> 02:07:24,750
ran out of shit.
So in some countries they have to deal 

2730
02:07:27,081 --> 02:07:32,081
with inclement weather so much.
Some places have to deal with some 

2731
02:07:32,081 --> 02:07:32,270
weight went on.
Nothing.

2732
02:07:32,290 --> 02:07:36,220
In California baseball it's like,
looks like it's 73 degrees.

2733
02:07:36,221 --> 02:07:40,200
It's not incredible.
I could say one or two.

2734
02:07:40,760 --> 02:07:43,600
It will be harder to not even hitting 
each other with anything.

2735
02:07:44,290 --> 02:07:49,290
You know?
Those guys are snowed in and they're 

2736
02:07:49,290 --> 02:07:50,650
running into each other full clip and 
the fucking freezing cold you remember?

2737
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:52,150
can you remember like when you were a 
little kid,

2738
02:07:52,151 --> 02:07:53,500
you fall.
When it was cold out,

2739
02:07:53,501 --> 02:07:55,180
it would hurt so much more.
Well,

2740
02:07:55,190 --> 02:07:57,140
catching a football to kogan somebody's 
website and go,

2741
02:07:57,250 --> 02:07:59,530
oh fuck.
It hurts so bad.

2742
02:07:59,531 --> 02:08:00,420
I mean,
how cold?

2743
02:08:00,490 --> 02:08:05,490
How much does it hurt when you get 
clipped by a fucking gigantic through 

2744
02:08:05,490 --> 02:08:05,490
mine though.

2745
02:08:07,330 --> 02:08:12,330
That must be so painful.
Do you think we've reached the end of 

2746
02:08:12,330 --> 02:08:12,500
this program?
Was it something.

2747
02:08:12,950 --> 02:08:16,660
This is about the end.
We've determined that at two hours in we

2748
02:08:16,661 --> 02:08:19,740
usually start getting boring shit.
And ari,

2749
02:08:19,790 --> 02:08:22,560
ari shapiro got the munchies,
all of my,

2750
02:08:23,260 --> 02:08:25,000
um,
we didn't take that many questions,

2751
02:08:25,001 --> 02:08:27,590
but hopefully we were entertaining to 
bitches.

2752
02:08:27,790 --> 02:08:30,040
The questions helped us go onto yes.
Yes,

2753
02:08:30,041 --> 02:08:30,700
definitely.
Well,

2754
02:08:30,701 --> 02:08:32,620
if it wasn't for you guys,
we couldn't have done this obviously.

2755
02:08:32,650 --> 02:08:33,760
What did we do?
We just talked.

2756
02:08:34,820 --> 02:08:39,820
They'll take a call to deal with for a 
while and they'll go off until they are 

2757
02:08:39,820 --> 02:08:39,820
ready for another color,
you know,

2758
02:08:39,820 --> 02:08:40,390
they'll just keep going.
well,

2759
02:08:40,420 --> 02:08:42,490
we've been looking for something like 
this for a long time.

2760
02:08:42,491 --> 02:08:43,810
We've been looking for something like 
this,

2761
02:08:43,930 --> 02:08:47,020
like to do some sort of a radio show and
I've talked about it like,

2762
02:08:47,021 --> 02:08:52,021
hey,
maybe we could all do like death squad 

2763
02:08:52,021 --> 02:08:54,271
radio or something like that.
But really what I realized is that the 

2764
02:08:54,271 --> 02:08:58,650
best way to do it is to do it like this,
do it on the internet and we'll have 

2765
02:08:58,650 --> 02:09:03,001
this thing evolve.
Turn this room into like a real like 

2766
02:09:03,010 --> 02:09:06,380
setup where you can sit down and watch 
her sexual studio.

2767
02:09:06,710 --> 02:09:10,480
we're going to have laptop set up so 
that we can play videos like you know,

2768
02:09:10,481 --> 02:09:12,150
like hey,
there's a,

2769
02:09:12,151 --> 02:09:17,151
you know,
some crazy new fucking animal attack 

2770
02:09:17,151 --> 02:09:18,730
video you so that when we do play it,
but it was just plug it in and then

2771
02:09:20,100 --> 02:09:22,290
next week we're going to have it at a 
different.

2772
02:09:22,291 --> 02:09:24,090
Next week Is when we're going to have 
all that,

2773
02:09:24,120 --> 02:09:26,310
all that stuff.
Like video on video.

2774
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:28,290
We could have like three people talking 
at once.

2775
02:09:28,291 --> 02:09:31,080
We're just,
he's going to have is internet and done.

2776
02:09:31,730 --> 02:09:36,730
It's done.
I just have to change the router next 

2777
02:09:36,730 --> 02:09:36,730
week so we'll have a bunch of fun shit.

2778
02:09:36,730 --> 02:09:37,250
Yeah.
Well we're gonna do is.

2779
02:09:37,251 --> 02:09:39,080
We're going to keep doing this every 
week and we're gonna.

2780
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:40,570
I'm like,
it's gonna.

2781
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:45,720
It's gonna expand and eventually I think
eventually the internet is gonna make 

2782
02:09:45,720 --> 02:09:46,610
its way into your car.
That's what I think is going to happen.

2783
02:09:46,790 --> 02:09:48,890
I think the internet would podcasts and 
stuff like that.

2784
02:09:48,891 --> 02:09:51,290
Like we aren't making mp3s of this.
We should have.

2785
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:53,050
Maybe we can.
Can we make it?

2786
02:09:53,110 --> 02:09:54,070
Yeah.
Okay.

2787
02:09:54,290 --> 02:09:56,300
Well,
we'll start making mp3s and put it up as

2788
02:09:56,301 --> 02:09:57,770
podcast because there was nothing about 
this,

2789
02:09:57,771 --> 02:10:02,771
what you needed to see us.
So we're going to do a show like this 

2790
02:10:02,771 --> 02:10:02,771
and then,
um,

2791
02:10:02,840 --> 02:10:07,840
we're gonna.
We're Just gonna do a lot more internet 

2792
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:07,840
stuff.
really.

2793
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:10,970
The,
what'S really good about any sort of a 

2794
02:10:10,970 --> 02:10:13,601
television show is the money a and the 
fact that people now come out to see 

2795
02:10:13,601 --> 02:10:18,041
your standup,
which is what we're always trying to 

2796
02:10:18,041 --> 02:10:18,041
work on.
You know,

2797
02:10:18,041 --> 02:10:18,041
I mean,
if you've never seen ari,

2798
02:10:18,041 --> 02:10:22,360
ari is fucking hilarious.
There's a lot of dudes that are out 

2799
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:24,080
there that are headline and these big 
clubs that in my opinion,

2800
02:10:24,110 --> 02:10:25,640
they're,
they're not as developed as,

2801
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:27,200
as,
they're not as funny as rs,

2802
02:10:27,201 --> 02:10:32,201
but ari doesn't have that many credits.
So it's hard for just clubs to book him.

2803
02:10:32,601 --> 02:10:33,980
and then they assume that people are 
going

2804
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:35,240
to come out and see him.
You know,

2805
02:10:35,241 --> 02:10:40,241
people come out and see somebody because
they know that guy from a movie or from 

2806
02:10:40,241 --> 02:10:43,241
a television show or whatever.
But ours are filthy pig and he goes on 

2807
02:10:43,241 --> 02:10:47,371
stage and these auditions and uh,
they say whatever you do don't talk 

2808
02:10:47,371 --> 02:10:47,890
about rape.
So what does already do?

2809
02:10:47,891 --> 02:10:52,891
You just minute rapists,
which is a hilarious bit.

2810
02:10:53,870 --> 02:10:57,200
But you know,
like the reason why some dudes are funny

2811
02:10:57,201 --> 02:11:00,020
is also the reason why people don't find
out that some dudes are funny.

2812
02:11:00,310 --> 02:11:03,130
We have a guy that we know that's 
probably one of the funniest guys ever.

2813
02:11:03,150 --> 02:11:08,150
This got brian holtzman and no one knows
who brian halterman has because he's so 

2814
02:11:08,150 --> 02:11:08,780
crazy and he should have,
it should have,

2815
02:11:08,830 --> 02:11:11,030
he should have hit big.
He was the guy that,

2816
02:11:11,260 --> 02:11:16,260
he was so crazy.
We would always go into the back of the 

2817
02:11:16,260 --> 02:11:16,310
room and watch him when he was real 
hatred.

2818
02:11:16,430 --> 02:11:18,470
Yeah.
And get so angry and nutty.

2819
02:11:18,471 --> 02:11:20,300
And every now and then they break 
character just.

2820
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:25,360
And a nice guy to be around to when he 
was hanging around at the club was 

2821
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:28,361
always friendly and know.
And I would love to see a reality show 

2822
02:11:28,361 --> 02:11:29,780
at brody stevens and him and they lived 
together.

2823
02:11:29,870 --> 02:11:31,160
Why?
Brody was too sensitive.

2824
02:11:31,170 --> 02:11:32,660
He'd get mad,
but when.

2825
02:11:32,661 --> 02:11:33,740
That'd be great.
No.

2826
02:11:34,010 --> 02:11:35,430
Brody,
stevens and bret ernst?

2827
02:11:36,910 --> 02:11:41,910
No,
no.

2828
02:11:43,590 --> 02:11:48,590
Holtzman and brody stevens together.
The following convenience would be 

2829
02:11:49,161 --> 02:11:51,310
worthwhile for like a show.
Like if you look at like,

2830
02:11:51,400 --> 02:11:55,010
like the kardashians.
Real real.

2831
02:11:55,070 --> 02:11:57,770
I think it would be.
Could get help fucked up some more.

2832
02:11:57,830 --> 02:11:59,510
What's the appeal of Cuba number?
The kardashians.

2833
02:11:59,511 --> 02:12:01,380
Just that she's got a fat ass.
That's It.

2834
02:12:03,770 --> 02:12:04,550
Yeah.
They're dumb,

2835
02:12:05,570 --> 02:12:08,090
but a lot of people are dumb too.
They don't mind.

2836
02:12:08,270 --> 02:12:09,450
We'll sort of,
you know,

2837
02:12:09,460 --> 02:12:10,950
they have some money.
Not,

2838
02:12:11,030 --> 02:12:13,880
not like paris hilton money with lots of
people go to asos.

2839
02:12:14,570 --> 02:12:16,540
Yeah,
but you just got to put one on tv.

2840
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:20,270
People become famous just because their 
ass and veto guerra chick.

2841
02:12:20,540 --> 02:12:22,570
I know who she is.
She probably doesn't need a hawaiian.

2842
02:12:22,940 --> 02:12:24,230
I know she is.
Why?

2843
02:12:24,290 --> 02:12:29,290
Because of harassed.
I don't even know what her voice sounds 

2844
02:12:29,290 --> 02:12:29,290
like.
I know her face looks like joey diaz,

2845
02:12:29,290 --> 02:12:32,921
but she's.
But she's only doing what she's doing,

2846
02:12:34,730 --> 02:12:37,690
but they'll take someone like what's her
name?

2847
02:12:37,740 --> 02:12:38,140
Okay.
You're,

2848
02:12:38,570 --> 02:12:40,460
you're a tv star now.
Jennifer lopez.

2849
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:42,260
How about that?
Famous because of ras.

2850
02:12:43,010 --> 02:12:46,940
Not really famous because her talent but
recognized because of her ass.

2851
02:12:47,510 --> 02:12:49,760
That's like one celebrity with everybody
talk.

2852
02:12:49,940 --> 02:12:54,940
If you talk about Jennifer Lopez,
you talk about or ask if there's a lot 

2853
02:12:54,940 --> 02:12:54,940
of celebrities that have great assets 
and our feet,

2854
02:12:55,330 --> 02:13:00,330
our feet are hot.
Fucking weirdo tablets in feet.

2855
02:13:02,210 --> 02:13:03,320
That's very strange.

2856
02:13:05,420 --> 02:13:07,070
Very strange thing.
but uh,

2857
02:13:07,190 --> 02:13:12,190
anyway,
we're always trying to do something fun 

2858
02:13:12,190 --> 02:13:12,260
where we could all do it together and 
just hang out and shoot the shit because

2859
02:13:12,261 --> 02:13:14,240
we have these conversations sometimes 
and we say,

2860
02:13:14,241 --> 02:13:15,320
man,
you know,

2861
02:13:15,321 --> 02:13:18,620
this is way more fun than like,
like a radio show.

2862
02:13:18,621 --> 02:13:23,621
Why don't we do our own thing like this?
Just figuring out how to get it made as 

2863
02:13:23,621 --> 02:13:23,621
always.
The bitch.

2864
02:13:23,621 --> 02:13:26,000
That's always the hard part.
But this is easy.

2865
02:13:26,330 --> 02:13:27,830
You know,
now that there's something like this,

2866
02:13:27,831 --> 02:13:30,620
we don't have to figure out shit,
so we'll do this.

2867
02:13:30,680 --> 02:13:32,280
I think it's a good creative outlet.

2868
02:13:32,470 --> 02:13:34,410
Like we have to go over what we said 
today,

2869
02:13:34,411 --> 02:13:36,180
but there was some funny shit that could
have been bits.

2870
02:13:36,990 --> 02:13:41,130
No,
because we do have a three 63,

2871
02:13:41,131 --> 02:13:42,480
60 of the whole room,

2872
02:13:43,120 --> 02:13:45,520
multiple cameras face each other and a 
couple of cameras.

2873
02:13:46,080 --> 02:13:46,600
Cameras.
Yeah,

2874
02:13:46,750 --> 02:13:51,750
I may have it next week.
We have it set up so you can choose 

2875
02:13:51,750 --> 02:13:51,820
which camera you want.
So it's multiple cameras.

2876
02:13:51,930 --> 02:13:56,930
Can we have it?
So they set up the choose which cameras 

2877
02:13:56,930 --> 02:13:56,930
but everyone comes off one sound feed.
Oh,

2878
02:13:56,930 --> 02:13:57,000
okay.
Good.

2879
02:13:57,710 --> 02:13:58,570
Oh,
that's awesome.

2880
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:00,330
All right,
well that's what we're going to do.

2881
02:14:00,331 --> 02:14:03,120
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm a four square box and uh,

2882
02:14:03,150 --> 02:14:05,970
just going to do more of this shit.
Let you guys know what the fuck is going

2883
02:14:05,971 --> 02:14:10,680
down this sunday night.
Ari and I are at the 9:30

2884
02:14:10,681 --> 02:14:14,250
club in Washington dc and it's always 
old stomping grounds.

2885
02:14:14,370 --> 02:14:17,250
So if there's any new hookers out there 
with an itchy mouth

2886
02:14:18,540 --> 02:14:20,240
that elidel nothing to do with my old 
stomping grounds.

2887
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:25,670
Willard Scratched topic.
He's been saying he really would like a 

2888
02:14:26,251 --> 02:14:30,900
blow to the trade show in dc.
It's the way we get our new president,

2889
02:14:30,901 --> 02:14:35,550
barack obama.
And on That note,

2890
02:14:35,551 --> 02:14:40,551
ladies and gentlemen,
thank you very much for tuning into our 

2891
02:14:40,551 --> 02:14:43,011
little youtube or you choose me,
ustream ustream show and we'll see you 

2892
02:14:43,011 --> 02:14:43,011
next week.
and,

2893
02:14:43,011 --> 02:14:47,931
um,
eventually we'll have a regular time 

2894
02:14:47,931 --> 02:14:49,320
that we try to adhere to every week and 
it might move around a little bit,

2895
02:14:49,321 --> 02:14:51,300
but for the most part it will be like 
around now,

2896
02:14:51,301 --> 02:14:54,390
like wednesday afternoon,
possibly tuesday stuff out.

2897
02:14:54,740 --> 02:14:57,870
If you get started more on time,
people get used like at three,

2898
02:14:57,871 --> 02:14:58,960
it'll be all right.
