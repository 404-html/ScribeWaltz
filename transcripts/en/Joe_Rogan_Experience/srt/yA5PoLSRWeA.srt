00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,310
Hello Freak bitches.
So that's a massive sacrifice you're

2
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:07,170
willing to take to be,
to do that.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,130
And this,
the fact that it's exists inside your

4
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:14,670
body for an undetermined state of time.
That's um,

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,990
that's pretty wild,
man.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,120
It's,
it's scary.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,300
Um,
yeah.

8
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:25,470
Honestly I feel like I was in a much
scarier place personally,

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,940
um,
before,

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:33,110
before I found this before I found them
before I got given a second family or

11
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:38,250
accepted into a second family and more
scarier because you were depressed

12
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:41,580
because he just will depress suicidal
thoughts.

13
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:44,160
I had for like 10 years,
just battle it from 13 years old,

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,470
23 and so,
um,

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,090
yeah,
that,

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,910
that was a lot scarier to me than going
home to his huddle thoughts when you're

17
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:52,741
13.
Yeah,

18
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:53,610
for sure.
And I,

19
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:54,444
I mean,
I was,

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,270
I was the one that like,
you know,

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,370
the kid in the,
in the class that,

22
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,413
I mean,
I wasn't,

23
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,770
I wasn't like,
I wouldn't say I was,

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,530
how do I say?

25
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,230
It was extremely brutal,
but it was happening to,

26
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,180
I mean,
everyone gets bullied for the most part.

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,830
Um,
somebody who's bullying you.

28
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,050
Yeah.
Well when I was growing up that from

29
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,980
from third grade until eighth grade for
sure it was brutal.

30
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,610
70 Dalton usually smaller than I was
here.

31
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,620
Dude,
I was smaller.

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,090
It takes a lot of balls to bully you.
Yeah.

33
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,660
And my backfire,
it's actually kind of why I found

34
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:31,410
fighting or net.
Why or it is kind.

35
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:36,240
It is because uh,
I was 13 years old and I had just gotten

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,440
so,
well two things.

37
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:40,950
Have you ever seen in Texas for high
school homecomings?

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,110
They have mums,
have you heard of that?

39
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,180
No.
It's a mom is tradition.

40
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:46,540
That's crazy.
Um,

41
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,000
now all,
all,

42
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,680
all the kids love him,
everything else.

43
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:54,681
But you get these like Chris Hodges or
fake flowers that they put real big up

44
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:58,380
top and then they are streamers with
literal bells and whistles,

45
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,270
full size teddy bears.

46
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,530
You can have two,
three teddy bears.

47
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,140
And when I was in high school,
the girl would wear it on her shoulder

48
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:06,510
and the guy would weird round his arm.
Now in Texas,

49
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:09,570
they literally have to put a harness
around them and hold these things up

50
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:10,950
because they're so big.
And there you go.

51
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,320
Mom texted him on Fox.
That's homecoming in Texas.

52
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,120
Why?
Look at that.

53
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,540
I'm telling you it's an example.
State the whole state.

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,500
I mean every heard of the every
homecoming that comes around tech Texans

55
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:28,050
are nuts about this.
I mean I lived in Texas and I was like

56
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:30,720
four months old,
so it was a there nuts in,

57
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:33,330
they've gotten bigger and bigger and
bigger every single year.

58
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,030
And uh,
how am I just hearing about the proud of

59
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:36,511
it?
It's weird.

60
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:38,670
I mean I I you just hearing about this
Jamie,

61
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,700
I think those are literally like two and
$300.

62
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,550
No,
not,

63
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,920
yeah.
When I was in high school they were like

64
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:46,320
7,000 all my God,
look at all those girls.

65
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,590
Look at that picture that you had done
there.

66
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:49,320
There's a giant group of girls with all
this.

67
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,490
This is ridiculous.
That not nuts.

68
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,340
How do you,
how do you go to the dance like that?

69
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,460
How do you go to the game like that?
I don't understand.

70
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:58,140
I mean literally the boyfriends are
walking behind him,

71
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:01,120
holding the stuff up for him because
what the,

72
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:02,770
it's getting too heavy or their neck
hurts,

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,450
but they want to wear it.
It's a tradition.

74
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,560
Yeah.
Everybody gets excited.

75
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:09,880
The bigger and the bigger the mum,
the better.

76
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,340
The more,
the more your date.

77
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:14,440
Like do you,
is this a mum company that you just

78
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:18,190
clicked on every single grocery store in
Texas?

79
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,300
Whenever it comes to like a September,
October,

80
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,260
November,
around homecoming time,

81
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:25,870
high school,
like this is people's jobs,

82
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,800
like seasonal jobs.

83
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,240
He sit around and they take special
orders.

84
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,880
They make them for you or they sound
where he can make them yourself.

85
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,580
Um,
that's so strange,

86
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,530
isn't it nuts?
How many is this?

87
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,580
It always baffles me when I find out
about something for the very first time.

88
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,330
I don't know why I'm so confused.
I would like to find out where the

89
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:45,940
tradition came from probably.
But I mean,

90
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,130
people,
it's just so ingrained in you.

91
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:50,140
If you're texting,
they have to get moms.

92
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,280
And so,
uh,

93
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,650
is there any other states?
Find out if other states except that I

94
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,590
literally the Oklahoma doesn't do it.
Louisiana doesn't New Mexico,

95
00:03:56,591 --> 00:04:01,591
I mean times 12 things non Texas need to
know about homecoming moms.

96
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,680
Uh,
what in the fuck mom started as a simple

97
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,431
flower.
Hold on,

98
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:12,880
scroll up a little bit.
Mum started as a simple flower guys,

99
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:15,220
give them to their homecoming date.

100
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,780
Oh that's hilarious.
Girls also give guys one called a

101
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:21,370
garter.
Like a garter.

102
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,031
Oh,
they put it on your,

103
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:25,810
on your arm when garter belt on over
your side.

104
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,850
How buzz.
Like one of those things that Thai

105
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,780
boxing where yeah,
being able to make moms can make you

106
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:33,220
rich.
Oh God.

107
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,190
See 60 to $300.
What?

108
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,220
$300 for fake flowers on her bucks.
It ain't cheap to electrify a mom.

109
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,410
Oh my God.
That chick's got home and lights up.

110
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,530
That's so crazy.
You could put led lighting.

111
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,330
Look at that scroll and Scroll up a
little bit,

112
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,330
but you can put led lighting and mum's,
I didn't know how many folks are doing

113
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:54,820
this back when I was in high school,
but nowadays you really want to impress

114
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:57,970
your date,
the latest and mum lighting technology

115
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,760
will help you do just that.
That is hilarious.

116
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:03,240
You know,
this isn't even like a joke website

117
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,620
right now.
Was a cereal to taking it serious.

118
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,170
So strange.
[inaudible]

119
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,310
it's really weird.
And so when I was in middle school,

120
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:13,840
seventh grade,
I,

121
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,640
you know,
look at that girl,

122
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:18,910
she's got a Christmas tree on her tits.
That's ridiculous.

123
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,483
They,
uh,

124
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,020
so you want to save,
I saved it up and my allowance asked one

125
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:28,750
of my crushes to go to the homecoming
game with me.

126
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,520
She said yes,
to my surprise,

127
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,960
I went to the game and,
uh,

128
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,390
spent pretty much all my allowance on,
uh,

129
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,580
the her mom and,
uh,

130
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,640
her name's Jessica and I took her to the
game and I'm up in the stands with her

131
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,330
and home or halftime comes around,
I'm up to the very top left and all of a

132
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:51,310
sudden everyone looks back up over the
right shoulders at us.

133
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,520
And this one guy,
he's kind of my,

134
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,700
my belief through elementary and middle
school for sure.

135
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,460
And um,
his name was justin as well.

136
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,790
And so he walks up and puts his arm out
to her and she puts her arm around his

137
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,530
and he grabs the streamer that says,
uh,

138
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,560
Justin and Jessica and a year on it or
whatever.

139
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,550
And uh,
he says,

140
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,200
thanks for getting her this.
And I'm like,

141
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:15,771
what?
And he goes,

142
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:16,940
you didn't think she'd come with you,
did you?

143
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,060
And so he just kind of walks down.
All the schools,

144
00:06:19,061 --> 00:06:21,440
look in,
they're all laughing and having fun,

145
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,600
but,
and that one hurt,

146
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:26,180
but what was worse with the next year?
Cause you know,

147
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,180
people liked that part of,
I don't know,

148
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,970
I think
for me,

149
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:35,690
when I see bullying now,
I just spoke at a middle school and I

150
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:39,560
told one of the teachers asked,
what should you tell a kid that's

151
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:42,530
battling with suicidal thoughts or
depression,

152
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,560
even maybe suicidal thoughts.
And I'm like,

153
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:47,000
well,
if this is 300,

154
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:50,900
400 kids in here,
like for sure one person is dealing with

155
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:52,400
these issues right now.

156
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,350
And I would say,
you know,

157
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,380
um,
the thing that probably saved me was my

158
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,830
parents didn't own a gun.
I'd probably only Texans that don't own

159
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:02,030
guns.
And uh,

160
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:02,864
then,
um,

161
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,480
I don't know.
I mean,

162
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:09,170
I guess one of the main things was,
um,

163
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,760
well I don't even know that I've ever
said this publicly,

164
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,840
but I remember,
um,

165
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,630
uh,
having attempted suicide once and then

166
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,830
I'm thinking about it again and then I'm
thinking,

167
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:23,090
you know,
what would this,

168
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,490
what would this do to my mom?
You know?

169
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,890
And so I love my Mama.
My Mama's boy,

170
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,990
dad's great too,
but that's just who I am.

171
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,230
She's a tough cookie.
She's where I got my competitiveness.

172
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:36,680
She was a national champion and barrel
racing state champion in tennis.

173
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:38,630
And so she always pushed me,
my dad,

174
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:39,650
if he,
uh,

175
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,350
if he was at a wrestling tournament and
it's the finals even state,

176
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,810
I would dislocate my thumb or something,
he'd come up,

177
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:46,100
you don't have to wrestle in the next
match.

178
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,360
Like it's the finals.
My Mom's like,

179
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:49,940
he's getting out there.
So my mom's the one pushing him to shut

180
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:50,774
up.
Jimmy.

181
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,800
He's gonna,
he's gonna go out there and he's going

182
00:07:52,801 --> 00:07:53,780
to wrestle.
He's going to win.

183
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:54,950
And so,
uh,

184
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,290
my dad was more of the,
the one who need to protect me and she's

185
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,660
the one wanting to push me out there.
Um,

186
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,490
so I guess,
uh,

187
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,110
I mean,
all I'm saying that except for,

188
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,230
oh,
that thought was just ringing in my

189
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:08,840
head.
And so whenever I finally verbalized

190
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:11,510
that and start talking to people,
that's what really helped.

191
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:13,130
You know,
it didn't have to be a bunch of people.

192
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,560
I didn't have to go around and be,
um,

193
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,410
I don't know,
a drama queen or do it for attention or

194
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:20,750
whatever,
but just find one person.

195
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,890
And for me at that age,
it was having a great mom and um,

196
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,940
and parents that love me.

197
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,590
And I think that's probably absolutely
what saved me at that time.

198
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,060
And so I was telling these kids,
you know,

199
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:32,894
hey,
tell if,

200
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,330
even if it's just your mom.
So I was taking pictures with some of

201
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:38,360
the kids afterwards and stuff and I'll
walk out to leave and I'm in the hall

202
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,560
and this mom stops me because she's with
her little guy and he's crying.

203
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,190
So a mom had come to school and heard
there was anti bullying talk.

204
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,850
She came up and I see this little guy
and reminded me,

205
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:51,500
a lot of me,
the only difference was,

206
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:54,200
uh,
was he had these kind of big glasses on,

207
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:59,201
but he was a little chubby and had just
had one of those things that you'd see

208
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:01,620
stereotypical like this kid's going to
get picked on.

209
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,480
And so I'm probably a lot like me.
He's used to getting his fat,

210
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:10,290
pinch tune nipples twisted and you know,
all that different stuff.

211
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,610
And so,
um,

212
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,770
he was out there just bawling with his
mom as Paul.

213
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,110
Massive.
I come talk to them for a little bit.

214
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:19,320
I did.
And she was saying that he had never

215
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:22,470
opened up with her and uh,
in the last two years,

216
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:24,900
but she knew he had been dealing with
really bad depression.

217
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,570
And right there he told her,
I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts

218
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:31,050
for two years.
And so I don't know why I even brought

219
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:32,370
that up except for like,
it's nuts.

220
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,310
My parents have a,
have a photography company and they meet

221
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:38,560
a memorial a few years back for a little
boy.

222
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:41,430
He was getting bullied,
didn't think he had an option out.

223
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,500
And he took his life at nine years old.
Oh my God.

224
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,970
When I think it was a swing set out
back,

225
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,750
so himself,
Jesus Christ.

226
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,160
And so,
um,

227
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,480
and I saw the plaque and everything made
up for him and just gut wrenching.

228
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,990
And so anyway,
I say that in the first story it wasn't

229
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:03,210
that,
but from this kind of one that kind of

230
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,130
brought everything to a head was I was
in middle eighth grade this time,

231
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,250
um,
got invited to a Jennifer's,

232
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,080
um,
birthday party.

233
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,770
Really excited.
Got The one of the real limitations in

234
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:18,060
my hands and,
um,

235
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,540
made the plan stuck to my mom,
asked if I could go and talk to some of

236
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,960
the people who else is going.
That was kind of Dorky kid anyways,

237
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:26,050
but,
um,

238
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,080
uh,
on the invitation,

239
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:30,840
I know that man,
it says costume contest and the winner

240
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:33,000
gets a prize.
Why started in research,

241
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:34,530
all this other stuff,
other people are doing it too.

242
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:37,650
And um,
I found out that her dad worked at Dr

243
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:38,660
Pepper,
um,

244
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,970
in that their house was decorated with
it,

245
00:10:40,971 --> 00:10:42,420
all this other stuff.
And then,

246
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:43,710
um,
and then the,

247
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:44,850
she loved transformers.

248
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,300
And so I thought,
what if I combine those two things?

249
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,373
What if I could,
uh,

250
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,740
meet myself a cardboard transformer from
head to toe?

251
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,020
Uh,
I think it was a 24 pack or on the head,

252
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,930
12 packs around the arms,
legs,

253
00:10:57,931 --> 00:10:58,710
boots.
I had,

254
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:02,010
I had a chest plate at a sword out of a
cardboard,

255
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:04,020
a country kid texted,
you see those moms?

256
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:05,940
We can do pretty much anything with duct
tape.

257
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,130
And,
uh,

258
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,230
so duct tape,
cardboard just made it up and walked

259
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:11,700
into the party and,
um,

260
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,320
her grandma opened the door and she
goes,

261
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,820
oh,
Jennifer's going to love this.

262
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,940
Walked into,
they literally had a Dr Pepper machine

263
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:19,590
where it was like old school ones you'd
have to pay,

264
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:21,150
just push the button.
It pops out.

265
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,560
13 year old kid.
You love that.

266
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:27,150
So we got Dr Pepper.
Can one hand have the Dr Pepper

267
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,650
Cardboard Sword in the other walk to the
backyard.

268
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,600
Um,
when whenever the door opens,

269
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,760
I opened the door and breathe there with
like some flashes of lights and fingers

270
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,710
pointing people laughing.
And um,

271
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,020
I remember Jennifer saying,
I can't believe you thought you were

272
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:43,170
cool enough to come to my party.
And I was the only one that was dressed

273
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:44,670
up.
Everybody else had gotten there early

274
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,550
and they all been planning and even the
invitations were fake just so that I

275
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:49,530
would come there,
dress up at another kid,

276
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:50,820
said,
um,

277
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,040
you're worthless.
So in that moment it felt worthless.

278
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,750
And then,
um,

279
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,240
the main belief said you should just
kill yourself.

280
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,870
And so whenever he said that 13 years
old battle with depression and suicidal

281
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:04,270
thoughts,
all the different stuff in it,

282
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,950
it took me on a downward spiral
tailspin.

283
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,730
Um,
it really sucked.

284
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:12,070
I didn't know how to cover it up.
And then I guess I'm getting back to

285
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:17,071
them and may route where I found that 13
years old at like a flea market in Texas

286
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:21,580
and walking down these aisles and
looking for a bb gun and all of a sudden

287
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:24,940
get to the site used video shop and it's
got UFC vhs.

288
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,240
I think it was two through 10 or 10,
two through 11 or something like that.

289
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,670
And I'm so I just,
my bottom wall,

290
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,060
um,
you were on there and a is a horrible

291
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:34,990
story,
man.

292
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,610
That is a terrible story.
How the fuck does kids be so mean?

293
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,913
I mean,
I thought he's,

294
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,100
honestly,
I,

295
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,210
I don't think it's,
I mean that crazy compared to,

296
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:50,320
I mean it is,
it's very like a methodical,

297
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:53,530
like very planned out and a lot of
people were in on it.

298
00:12:53,531 --> 00:12:55,150
I think that probably was one of the
things like,

299
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,870
honestly,
Jennifer was that the biggest crush I

300
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:01,090
ever had and you know,
elementary,

301
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:02,020
middle school growing up,
you know,

302
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,330
and so she was the one that really
wanted to impress.

303
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:05,710
That's why I did that research,
you know,

304
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,410
and then to know that she was in on it,
these other guys planned it,

305
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:10,430
but she went along with it,
um,

306
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,930
to her to have her say that to you,
like the,

307
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,210
I can't believe you thought you were
cool enough to come to my party.

308
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,130
Yeah.
Fuck man.

309
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,300
Yeah.
I ended up leaving.

310
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,360
Um,
and this is before cell phones.

311
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,010
Uh,
and I didn't have a cell phone until I

312
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,680
was like 16 and 17,
and I'm,

313
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:32,490
so I'm 13 run out,
found a dairy queen and uh,

314
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:37,240
went in the back and where the drive
through is there was like a,

315
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,910
I don't know,
the dumpster and they got like the fence

316
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:42,460
around it and I just was able to open
it,

317
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,670
sit there and just cried basically
until,

318
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:47,020
uh,
so when we came out to throw away the

319
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:48,820
trash and then they were like,
oh,

320
00:13:48,821 --> 00:13:51,880
how many got down and what do you need?
And all this other stuff.

321
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:53,140
Can you call your mom?
I'm like,

322
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,860
if I have a phone.
And so I walked inside,

323
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,580
called her,
but she wasn't there.

324
00:13:57,581 --> 00:14:00,190
So it took a little while to get ahold
of my mom.

325
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,173
And then,
um,

326
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,733
yeah,
I mean it was just,

327
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,490
it was nuts because,
um,

328
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,420
it's weird how you,
you'll believe,

329
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,440
especially in today's age with social
media and all the tweets and things that

330
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:13,060
people just throw away.
I throw around,

331
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,560
um,
you know,

332
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,720
it's nuts how you can see something.
We don't even know him.

333
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,020
They might have one follower,
but somehow it can still,

334
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,080
if you let it,
it can still affect you instead of just

335
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,230
shrugging it off.
That's a totally different thing though.

336
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:30,130
So saying something on twitter and
someone saying something and looking you

337
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:31,190
in the eyes.
Yeah.

338
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:35,290
And planning out this big deception.
Yeah.

339
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,930
But you're such a nice guy.
Like I don't understand what,

340
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,050
what the fuck causes someone to be such
a shit head like that?

341
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,470
Well,
I don't know man.

342
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,540
I think,
well,

343
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,374
I think,
um,

344
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,750
I've,
I've matured a lot where,

345
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,660
I mean obviously 29 said 13,
but,

346
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:50,980
uh,
uh,

347
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:56,770
I think I just became an easy target and
because he's a nice guy and they just,

348
00:14:57,381 --> 00:15:01,340
maybe I wouldn't stand up for myself and
maybe I wasn't the biggest kid,

349
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:04,100
but I was Chubby and bigger and,
uh,

350
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,410
uh,
yeah,

351
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:08,750
I think it just was easy to pick on me
in the locker rooms.

352
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,583
Pick on me.
And the,

353
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:10,610
I don't know.
I think,

354
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:15,500
I think the stats I was looking at with
something like 87% of bullying doesn't

355
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:17,720
happen in the presence of,
um,

356
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,460
adults,
adults.

357
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,170
Right.
And then,

358
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,790
uh,
I forget,

359
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,220
but you know,
even the people around like how you're

360
00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:25,891
saying,
you know,

361
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,070
if to people plan it out and everything
else,

362
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:30,530
look in the eyes.
I mean I think that might've been what

363
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:32,840
took me back the most because I was
like,

364
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,980
man,
like this is,

365
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,670
if you're sitting by that,
this is what I tried to tell some of the

366
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:42,020
kiddos grown up.
Now it's like if you think that by

367
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,300
laughing I'm,
if you're there and you're not bullying

368
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:45,440
but you're giggling,
you're laughing.

369
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:47,420
Like you're definitely a part of it.
You're an encourager.

370
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,540
But then if you're,
even if you're silent and you're just

371
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,060
watching it and you don't,
like now your,

372
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,860
if you see it,
you have a choice,

373
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:55,700
you can do something about it.

374
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,640
You can not.
And so I feel like that's a passive

375
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,050
standby kind of encouragement where it,
and so for me it was like everyone was

376
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:04,730
there,
people were saying it,

377
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,010
people were laughing,
people were watching,

378
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,570
but nobody was standing up for me.
So it was a definitely,

379
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:12,950
that's what hurt the most.
We'll see.

380
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:16,880
So there's two giants says the one with
the other guy named Justin.

381
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,360
So they plan that out to fuck man.
Yeah.

382
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:22,550
Both kids.
Yeah.

383
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,030
It was actually part of the same kids,
so yeah.

384
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:26,900
Damn.
Yeah.

385
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,853
And then,
uh,

386
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,380
so from that,
um,

387
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,151
yeah,
that,

388
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:33,980
that's,
that's definitely been the biggest

389
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,180
battle of my life has been depression,
suicidal thoughts.

390
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,900
And it was all from that bullying.
There was nothing other than that for

391
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,420
the depression.
I mean,

392
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,990
it went from,
technically I would say it went from

393
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:49,070
third grade to 10th grade.

394
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,790
And then whenever I started wrestling
and my parents transferred me out of the

395
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,570
school,
everything else then,

396
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,150
but the bullying is what caused all
these suicidal thoughts.

397
00:16:56,151 --> 00:17:01,151
There's nothing else that was bumming
you out about life that is so fucked up

398
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,360
at some shitty mean kids can all of a
sudden throw this monkey wrench in your

399
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:08,210
life.
And then I've,

400
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:09,330
I've learned,
and I mean,

401
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,460
of course I,
uh,

402
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,190
you know,
a lot.

403
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,670
I used to looking back,
I shouldn't have,

404
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:18,080
I shouldn't have ever let it get to the
point to where you know,

405
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:21,320
I think I should hurt myself or kill me.
You know what,

406
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:25,610
just a real quick put that together with
the pygmies and Congo,

407
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:28,680
whenever I opened up and shared with
some of them around the campfire,

408
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,640
just hanging out,
talking,

409
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:34,400
sharing life stories.
I shared that and I just remember the

410
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,660
looks on several people's faces just so
baffled.

411
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,290
Like did he just say he wanted to hurt
himself,

412
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,270
he was suicide.
He wanted to kill himself.

413
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,130
I'll let him and stuff.
And then my sister asking me,

414
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,590
does that not happen here?
And they're like,

415
00:17:48,591 --> 00:17:49,590
whoa.
There's of them were like,

416
00:17:49,591 --> 00:17:51,900
well we've heard of that happening
before and yeah,

417
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:53,970
there's,
there's this guy that was that guy and

418
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:57,030
that guy and that guy and we heard that
someone in their village had hurt

419
00:17:57,031 --> 00:17:58,620
themselves or kill themselves or
something.

420
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,170
But most of the people I think were
like,

421
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,130
no,
never heard.

422
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:04,080
Why would anyone,
if you hurt yourself,

423
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:05,970
you're only like,
it's only hurting you.

424
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,590
Right.
That's not going to help anything.

425
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,440
But you just want the pain yet.
Yeah,

426
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,210
yeah.
Here I just wanted the pain to end.

427
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,490
But there it's like,
it's nuts because they,

428
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,310
if I look at it,
I was a little kid.

429
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,820
I got bullied by some,
some stupid kids,

430
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,710
and then look at,
if I look at what they're going through

431
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,500
me and it makes it,
it makes it,

432
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,810
it shrinks it,
it makes it microscopic.

433
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:35,670
Whenever you stop just focusing on your
own problems and you start looking at

434
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:37,830
others,
other problems that maybe you can be a

435
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:39,910
part of helping solve that problem.
So,

436
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:45,110
so this bullying all throughout your
childhood led into adulthood and the

437
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:50,880
only thing that made it better was you
go into the Congo and helping out these

438
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:55,530
pygmies and building wells and,
and sort of dedicating and devoting your

439
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:58,050
life to their life.
Yeah,

440
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,010
I would say practically,
um,

441
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,610
that has been,
you know,

442
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:04,590
to have a sense of purpose.
I mean,

443
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:07,020
I think it's a,
it's a lot of different things,

444
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,770
but that all kind of came together.
But for me.

445
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:11,191
Yeah.
I mean,

446
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:14,430
when you're not living for yourself and
you live in for others,

447
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:15,720
you just want,
I mean,

448
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:21,000
I didn't know that for me,
I had a big paradigm shift or change in

449
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:22,590
my life whenever,
you know,

450
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:24,030
coming out of the addiction,
I felt like,

451
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,810
I mean like I don't have to walk around
and hate myself and stay away from

452
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:30,840
people because they either going to hurt
me or I'm going to want to hurt them.

453
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,003
Like,
uh,

454
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,720
I don't have to do that.
I can,

455
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,940
I can help people.
I can want to love him.

456
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,500
I can,
you know,

457
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,670
figure out something that I did at first
started at what really started helping a

458
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:44,100
lot,
was involved with a lot of different

459
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:47,670
stuff from a juvenile detention center.
Going into meeting with some of those

460
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:52,671
kids once a week to a homeless shelter,
to becoming a official volunteer at the

461
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,710
Denver Children's hospital and taking
the grudge guys through there.

462
00:19:56,711 --> 00:20:01,110
And did,
do you stay in any way in touch with

463
00:20:01,111 --> 00:20:04,540
those kids from back in the day from the
kids who bullied you?

464
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,970
Did you ever,
it was actually funny,

465
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,190
after the ultimate fighter,
um,

466
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,880
I got invited out by one of the guys,
um,

467
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,010
and,
uh,

468
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:17,010
just because I think a couple of people,
they'll just,

469
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,590
yeah,
it's all one of the guys who was one of

470
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:20,850
the main guys and he's like,
Hey,

471
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,550
I just saw him walking around downtown
Fort Worth.

472
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,500
And he said,
why don't we go out here?

473
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,011
Whatever.
I'm like,

474
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:26,820
all right,
I'll go.

475
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,960
And,
well,

476
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,470
he had actually,
uh,

477
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,870
brought me into,
uh,

478
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,920
the Sushi restaurant in all around the
table was most of the people that were

479
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,020
not most,
it's probably only eight or 10 people,

480
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,830
but they were some of the main kids that
were at that party when I dressed up and

481
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,491
everything.
Why?

482
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:42,324
Man,
if you,

483
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,900
if we had known you were a fighter or
you can kick their butts and we wouldn't

484
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:47,960
have done that to you.
And I'm just like it.

485
00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:49,660
So I told him I was going to bathroom,
just left,

486
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,863
um,
from,

487
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,570
I think that's the only time I've ever
done anything like that,

488
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:53,910
but I'm just like,
I can't,

489
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,680
can't be around these guys.
Did.

490
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,650
Did you,
did you sense any feeling of remorse

491
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:01,480
from them or they just want to be
friends?

492
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,770
One new one or two of them?
Uh,

493
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,850
one guy for sure.
He's,

494
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,150
he's,
he's pretty cool now and um,

495
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,300
but then one is a,
is a knuckle head for sure and still,

496
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,153
yeah.
Picked up.

497
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,550
You know,
it's that classic thing of kids ganging

498
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:21,670
up on one kid.
That's a weird instinct that sometimes

499
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:24,700
children have.
You remember that movie carry on?

500
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,310
They uh,
she goes to the prom and the sea.

501
00:21:27,311 --> 00:21:31,360
Did you ever say Shanti's basic moving?
It's based on a great Stephen King Book.

502
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,400
I knew that the cover,
the,

503
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,730
the sissies basic movie was really
trippy.

504
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,470
Uh,
John Travolta's in it.

505
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,720
Hmm.
Bagging the de young and handsome.

506
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,210
Um,
but it's,

507
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,070
you know,
that's the themes that they push her.

508
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,760
She has these crazy telekinetic powers
and they push her to this point and they

509
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:51,960
do it by mocking her and bullying her.
They take her to the prom,

510
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,000
they pour pig's blood on our hedge,
which winds up killing everybody.

511
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,111
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

512
00:21:56,111 --> 00:21:57,220
It was pretty,
pretty crazy.

513
00:21:57,221 --> 00:22:02,221
But that's that thing that happens when
kids gang up on a kid that they feel

514
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:05,980
like is vulnerable.
Like what the fuck is that man?

515
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:07,870
What a horrible instinct take.
Is that,

516
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,210
what do I mean?
I,

517
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:14,590
I just,
I struggle to understand where that

518
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:19,150
instinct comes from or why people do it.
It's um,

519
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,170
especially little kids.
No,

520
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,440
I mean I,
I guess I can understand that if the

521
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:26,650
kids have been abused themselves and
they want to lash out there angry and

522
00:22:26,651 --> 00:22:29,140
hurt,
but oftentimes it's just they find

523
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:32,710
someone who's a vulnerable,
it's like they find the pecking order

524
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:34,930
and they find the one person that can
get away with them.

525
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:38,710
They all funneled their insecurities and
their anger and their aggression on this

526
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:41,590
one person just because think with no
regard whatsoever,

527
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,170
what kind of impact it's going to have
on that kid.

528
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,190
Yeah.
I think,

529
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:49,720
I think one of the things that makes it
so much worse now is elite.

530
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,411
I mean,
I don't know.

531
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:53,530
I get to hear some of the stuff and they
can't escape it.

532
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,030
Like,
you know,

533
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,160
cause it follows him home.
I know that cyber bullying and they get

534
00:22:57,161 --> 00:22:59,020
the text and the,
all that stuff is so,

535
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,280
it's constantly,
so I could at least escape it from eight

536
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:04,720
to three,
eight to three.

537
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,550
I was at school,
but when I came home,

538
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,020
I was,
I was okay.

539
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,710
And,
um,

540
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,580
maybe that gave me a break.

541
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:19,580
[inaudible]
yeah.
