1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,450
The joe rogan experience try
by day Joe Rogan podcast.

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,240
Bill Burr.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:12,710
Impression.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,700
That's pretty solid right there.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,150
It's like a fucking baby bed.

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:17,450
Um,

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,450
so path from Menarche unleashes what
can only be described as a cartoonish

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,601
hurling.

9
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:24,650
Like did you ever see that movie?

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,630
Oh my God,

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,050
it's the movie stand by me.

12
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,760
And the way that you never
see in the real world.

13
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,320
Well this tops that I,

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,080
how could I packed up?

15
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:42,914
You just sit there.

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,670
Well he just did.

17
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,740
He's an animal that got this.

18
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,130
The guy that got puked on his,

19
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:46,964
he's still alive.

20
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,900
His open mouth.

21
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:51,351
Okay.

22
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,184
And it's

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,153
quite fine

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,430
while the than the beginning.

25
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,740
There's no visual for the first
five minutes or you can cool.

26
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:02,643
There

27
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,990
is that helps you a joke.

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,670
Yeah.

29
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,840
Anybody would say no to
her shoulder rubbing her.

30
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:10,674
Nashville

31
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,130
particularly shifts for this.

32
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,360
Flip her off.

33
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,390
This interview ends with
my wife under the table.

34
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:24,840
Oh,

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,880
that's considered a failure.

36
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,810
I'd rather it not happen.

37
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,170
It's going to stay friends here.

38
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,640
I've been marked already today.

39
00:01:37,641 --> 00:01:39,030
So markets,

40
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,623
Marvin,

41
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,050
you know a lot about that.

42
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,800
And what was your first experience
that was unethical for you?

43
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,720
It's like what substance?

44
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,381
Well,

45
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:48,890
the first,

46
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,723
um,

47
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,770
the first experience I had with
anything outside of the norm was Mbma.

48
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,540
That was the first like,

49
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,990
Whoa,

50
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,400
I didn't know this was available.

51
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,090
You know,

52
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,950
that was her first like introduction
to the idea of consciousness altering

53
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,720
experiences and then the
next one was suicide.

54
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,830
And then they first ineffable
experience where you realized,

55
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,161
Oh,

56
00:02:13,161 --> 00:02:15,320
I am connected directly to the device.

57
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:15,791
So sign.

58
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,780
But pretty much the,

59
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,643
um,

60
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,860
the MDA experience was just a realization
how insecure I was and how insecure in

61
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:27,930
general are in our
interactions with each other.

62
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,690
How much of our interactions with each
other are sort of dependent upon our

63
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:36,700
perceptions about people are gonna
react to us and we have this wall.

64
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,340
And that wall completely went away on MDM.

65
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,710
And I found that fascinating,

66
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:41,981
you know,

67
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:43,790
and I didn't know that
that state was available,

68
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,470
but then the psilocybin experience
was one where I just sort of kind of

69
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:52,490
understood that that was the first time
I'd ever really wrapped my head around

70
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:57,491
the fact that this is not the top of
the ground and you're not standing on

71
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,710
something and there's not an above you,

72
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,320
but that you're sort of in
the middle of everything.

73
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:03,950
I have never really had it in my,

74
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,380
my own head before.

75
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,850
That was the first time where I just
sort of really dawned on me and I have

76
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:12,200
watched cosmos documentaries.

77
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,420
I had seen a bunch of different,

78
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:14,723
you know,

79
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,880
things on astronomy where I sort of
kind of got the idea that we're at the

80
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:23,380
outside edge of the galaxy and this
galaxy swimming in these galaxies.

81
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,730
But it never really sunk in until
the one mushroom trip where I'm like,

82
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,600
well,

83
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,021
you know,

84
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:31,390
you should really sort of wrap
your head around like that.

85
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,370
It goes that way forever.

86
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:34,280
It and that way forever.

87
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:34,560
And the,

88
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:34,841
you know,

89
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:35,710
it's a weird,

90
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,380
it's turtles all the way down.

91
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,570
The DMT one was,

92
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,370
I always described Dmt as mushrooms,

93
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:43,980
times a million plus aliens,

94
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:44,990
you know.

95
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,823
So

96
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,450
have you had much experience with Iowasca?

97
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:49,720
No,

98
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,050
no,

99
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:50,530
no,

100
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:50,741
no.

101
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:51,574
It's all been

102
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,780
my business partner.

103
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:00,940
The guy who makes the onyx stuff,

104
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:04,280
he's gone twice down
to Peru now for seven,

105
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,340
seven.

106
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,760
He was seven days of the time
between three and four experiences.

107
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:10,594
It was seven days.

108
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,810
You've gone to Machu
Picchu and too many times.

109
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,953
Amazing.

110
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:16,803
Have you been there?

111
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,571
Oh,

112
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:18,700
you've got to see up.

113
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,290
Ever been.

114
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,011
It's really crazy.

115
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:21,844
It's teaching

116
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,870
ancient ruins that I've ever been to.

117
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,193
Well,

118
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,460
you're ahead of me there.

119
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:27,761
I,

120
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:31,970
for some reason I never
been to the Miami really,

121
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,050
but I've been to the Inca ruins like
probably six or seven times just because I

122
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,220
go down there so much.

123
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:40,440
I do a lot of stuff down,

124
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,573
you know,

125
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,413
uh,

126
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,820
both research and teaching and all that.

127
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,560
So what is your take on,

128
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,573
you know,

129
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,801
what's it called?

130
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:51,280
EO Tombow or up to Tom.

131
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:51,441
Oh,

132
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:51,871
Lantech,

133
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:52,111
Tom,

134
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:52,580
about all that.

135
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,120
That's that the incredibly large rocks.

136
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:59,140
And fit it in the unusual
like jigsaw puzzles spaces.

137
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,730
They do that.

138
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,750
That's a good question.

139
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,370
What's your town?

140
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,711
Yeah,

141
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:04,544
man.

142
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,550
Well,

143
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,001
you know,

144
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:08,560
I don't really know my,

145
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,640
my opinion of,

146
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,940
I mean the other place
you see that is sex,

147
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,770
a line item,

148
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,300
which is the ruins complex outside Cusco.

149
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,650
Similar thing,

150
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:17,951
you know,

151
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,250
rocks half the size of this
room that had been moved around.

152
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,550
I don't know how to take to it,

153
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,720
but I will tell you one thing.

154
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,830
A EMS bell,

155
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:28,420
Graham Hancock's work,

156
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:28,950
well,

157
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,231
his,

158
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:30,380
we've had him on the podcast,

159
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:31,214
k he,

160
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,360
his writing so completely changed my
perspective on that whole thing because I

161
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:38,050
think he's right.

162
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:40,000
I think that the ink is,

163
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:42,160
could not possibly have built,

164
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,470
I mean all of this in a hundred years,

165
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,220
you know,

166
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,491
the,

167
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:53,491
the height of the Inca empire was
basically from 1450 to 1515 and they say

168
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,720
before that there wasn't much,

169
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:56,080
you know,

170
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,650
but I don't buy it.

171
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,030
And he says,

172
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:04,031
his postulate is that the Incas didn't
create all this money metal architecture.

173
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:09,650
They sort of moved in that this came
from a much more ancient civilization.

174
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,080
Possibly us back as far
back as 15,000 years.

175
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,770
You know,

176
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,120
not all of the ruins,

177
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:18,280
but some of them like,

178
00:06:18,281 --> 00:06:18,470
uh,

179
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:18,720
the,

180
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,460
the sun gates at Lake Titicaca too,

181
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,490
when not go and talks about
how if you look at it,

182
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,100
it's astronomical
orientations and all that.

183
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,560
It's aligned with the,

184
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:31,641
with the,

185
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,090
uh,

186
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,980
equal nautical points,

187
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,730
uh,

188
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,120
you know,

189
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,790
as they were 15,000 years ago.

190
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,950
I think his,

191
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,050
I think fingerprints of the gods,

192
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:43,610
which I'm only about halfway through.

193
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,320
It's just a fascinating book.

194
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,154
You read it,

195
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,230
it just throws the whole
picture of archeology and to,

196
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,100
you know,

197
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,670
into question of you.

198
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:56,300
He's not a crazy remedied person.

199
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,860
He's presenting evidence like these
maps giving talks about in the first

200
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:01,694
chapter.

201
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,000
This is not stuff that he's dreamed on.

202
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,460
We'll also the geological
evidence on the spanx.

203
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,540
That's another one I'll see a
lodging company brings up the,

204
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:10,721
uh,

205
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:15,721
the more recent studies have shown that
there's a layer about at about 12,000

206
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:22,091
years where they repeatedly fine this
glass that exists from nuclear explosions

207
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,800
when they blow up nuclear bombs
or from asteroidal impacts.

208
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,281
Right.

209
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:29,480
I think that a 12,000 years ago we were
probably hit by a devastating meteor

210
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:29,950
shower.

211
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,220
Yeah.

212
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,380
They found that in the same
level all across the world.

213
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:34,214
They found this.

214
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,150
So it was like a global
catastrophe and about 12,000 years.

215
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:39,220
And that's confirmed.

216
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:39,820
They have,

217
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,750
they've been finding this
over and over and over again.

218
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,261
I mean,

219
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:47,261
it only stands to reason that if we
do have all these ancient tales of

220
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,810
catastrophic events and
civilizations wiped out,

221
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,250
that there must have been
something and most likely we are,

222
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:55,931
you know,

223
00:07:55,931 --> 00:07:56,031
uh,

224
00:07:56,031 --> 00:08:01,031
we build and we fall in building
astronomical events or global volcanic

225
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,880
eruptions that that changed everything.

226
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,050
Yeah.

227
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,280
It's not implausible.

228
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:07,521
I mean,

229
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:08,331
you don't have to,

230
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:08,750
uh,

231
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,520
you don't have to invoke miracles.

232
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:11,060
It's just,

233
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,360
it's something that happened,

234
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,850
but then somehow we,

235
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:15,381
I mean,

236
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:16,880
I don't understand why,

237
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:17,510
uh,

238
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,780
archeology is another one of these things.

239
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,180
It's in denial about this stuff.

240
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,230
Yeah.

241
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,063
Or,

242
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:25,761
well,

243
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:27,650
did you hear what they found about cheese?

244
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,950
They found that the more recent
studies have shown that the,

245
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:31,071
uh,

246
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:31,820
the oldest,

247
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,360
uh,

248
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,130
the carbon dating that are
getting back from these,

249
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:34,400
uh,

250
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,260
cheesemaking,

251
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,593
whatever they are,

252
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,940
pottery or whatever the fuck it is,

253
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,440
7,000 years,

254
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,160
you know,

255
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,650
they're making cheese 7,000 years ago.

256
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,730
That's how it is.

257
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,031
That,

258
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,271
I mean,

259
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:44,750
that is,

260
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,830
that's advanced stuff.

261
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,450
And when you add that to the,

262
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,293
the of the,

263
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,450
the need previous notion
has LX 6,000 years ago,

264
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:54,450
like Sumac,

265
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,100
that was probably oldest thing we know.

266
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,150
Then they find,

267
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,210
go back to the topic,

268
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:58,950
right.

269
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,720
As they're uncovering that
and they don't for sure.

270
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:02,150
That's at least 14,000,

271
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,720
14,000.

272
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,320
Right.

273
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,290
So I think it's entirely plausible.

274
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,380
It's not that far fetched to think
that there may have been some,

275
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,120
okay.

276
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,810
Some contact with some extra
terrestrials civilization.

277
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:19,290
I mean,

278
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,730
you find this myth.

279
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:21,980
No.

280
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,170
Well,

281
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:22,561
I mean,

282
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:25,350
everything that you're
talking about necessarily,

283
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,850
I'm not really sure how you jumped from
civilizations are older than we thought

284
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,580
to sexiness.

285
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,760
Other than that.

286
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,593
Yeah.

287
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,800
But they all have this,

288
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:39,150
this myth of [inaudible] and
the Incas and the new world.

289
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:40,470
It's very culture,

290
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,570
uh,

291
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,000
uh,

292
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
of a superior being who
puruse historically critical
juncture and basically

293
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,240
civil license.

294
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,210
Isn't it possible that that superior being
is some dude who grew up on the other

295
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:55,860
part of the world that had the mushrooms,

296
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,830
their whole culture evolves to a,

297
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:02,280
are radically higher level and then
they get an boats and come over to these

298
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,360
eight white people.

299
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,980
They're still throwing sticks.

300
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,710
Yeah.

301
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,750
Something like that.

302
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:12,110
Shock my bag and my shows and go
catch a cast and a couple of decades

303
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,650
work it out yourself.

304
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:16,500
Yeah.

305
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,340
They came back to the Incas
slaughtering people know like,

306
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,531
okay,

307
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:20,550
you guys are doing it wrong.

308
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,520
Right,

309
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,353
right.

310
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,670
So you know,

311
00:10:23,671 --> 00:10:24,241
I don't know.

312
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:29,230
This is why we need to admit time travel
so we can actually go back and verify

313
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:31,080
it with just what the fuck was going on.

314
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,310
Somebody said something once,

315
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:35,560
that was one of the most I
may may have been correct.

316
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:35,730
Wow.

317
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,660
I don't remember who it was,

318
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:41,661
but he said that one day the they're
going to get to a point where computer

319
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:47,181
processing power is so incredible that
you were going to be able to take you on

320
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:52,401
all of the data on all the variables of
life and circumstances on this planet

321
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,860
and calculate those and go back in time
based on what we have today and knowing

322
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:00,870
how fast cars are,

323
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:02,670
what it takes to burn gasoline,

324
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:05,940
but all of these massive,

325
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:10,941
insane amount of data and literally be
able to extrapolate what what happened in

326
00:11:11,161 --> 00:11:13,620
the past through some sort
of a mathematical equation.

327
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,060
It's impossible for us to wrap our heads
around now because we're just not there

328
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:18,361
yet,

329
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:21,070
but whatever it is establishing
your from now 5,000 years to run,

330
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:26,071
they literally will be able to at least
go back in time and information way.

331
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:27,421
Well,

332
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:28,110
this sounds,

333
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,360
this is similar to,

334
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,053
okay,

335
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,030
so you're going to say

336
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,400
it's the physics of your mortality or
actually I was bragging to your formation.

337
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,120
It's

338
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,050
foundations like based on that idea,

339
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:43,110
except they use demographic
to calculate what will happen.

340
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:43,891
Yeah.

341
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:45,600
I'm planning for our society,

342
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:45,991
right?

343
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:49,870
Based on these incredibly complex
computer algorithms about here's the

344
00:11:49,871 --> 00:11:53,040
demographics who see you count
on next year's though social,

345
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,100
we can

346
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,270
predict what will happen,

347
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,230
what will happen,

348
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,710
but find this level of detail.

349
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:00,520
Yeah.

350
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:00,860
Well,

351
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,331
you know,

352
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:04,090
frank ticklers work the physics
of evil or chatting with Wifi.

353
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:04,570
No,

354
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,120
I've heard that.

355
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,280
I've heard the name of that book.

356
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:06,940
Yeah.

357
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,260
It's,

358
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,170
it's interesting.

359
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,570
I mean he had this idea that,

360
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:10,961
you know,

361
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:12,040
computing power,

362
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,340
like he says like Chris,

363
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:18,370
while computing power is exponentially
increasing and that at some point it will

364
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:25,091
be possible to simulate
heaven and that you know,

365
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,460
people,

366
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,670
it will be essentially possible too.

367
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:31,763
Uh,

368
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,173
well,

369
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,403
uh,

370
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,840
to enter a simulated world,

371
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,370
uh,

372
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,130
that is the,

373
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,790
the world beyond death.

374
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,070
That is the vision by the
world's major religions.

375
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,373
This is,

376
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:46,701
you know,

377
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:51,600
when at the end of time we will in
fact all be resurrected into this says

378
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:54,030
computer simulations of ourselves.

379
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,840
Are you familiar with this?

380
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,010
Most recent,

381
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,440
the idea of computer simulation theory,

382
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,690
but they have actually found this
self repairing computer software.

383
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,310
We coho repairing mathematical code and a,

384
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,760
the equations of a,

385
00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:11,594
a strength area

386
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,013
and stuff.

387
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:14,600
No,

388
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,380
this guy was with the Neil
degrasse Tyson had this,

389
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:18,680
uh,

390
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,380
interview with this physicist
that's trying to explain it,

391
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:26,381
but it was a type of self correcting
computer code that they discovered in 1940

392
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,720
or was invented and created in 1940.

393
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,880
Let me pull this up because
I don't want you this

394
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,730
[inaudible]

395
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:53,910
okay.
