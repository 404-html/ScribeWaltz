1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,280
Boom,
we live.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,990
Here we go.
Douglas,

3
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:05,460
Stan,
hope smoking cigarettes.

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,540
I was just a swore that,
uh,

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,240
you know what?
I'm just going to smoke outside this 

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,371
time.
Last time I stuck this place up so 

7
00:00:16,371 --> 00:00:16,371
badly.
It wasn't bad at all.

8
00:00:16,371 --> 00:00:16,371
Yellowed?
No.

9
00:00:16,371 --> 00:00:17,970
Afterwards he.
Because you kept saying,

10
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:22,971
no,
I get this whole system now it's 

11
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:23,130
slipping.
It's definitely dissipating.

12
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:27,120
I see the smoke sucked away,
but I remember at the end last time.

13
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,790
Yeah,
that didn't work as good as I thought it

14
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,890
was.
Gonna you really reached this place up.

15
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,980
It's not perfect.
You know,

16
00:00:33,981 --> 00:00:36,180
you're always getting cigarettes.
You know,

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,750
Douglas,
where do you get that sugar free.

18
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:41,850
Fucking.
Yeah.

19
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,610
Sugar free.
I can't be good for you.

20
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,520
Well I am.
Now I'm going to put a splash of whiskey

21
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:52,521
in it just to hopefully kill the 
aspartame taste fucking by the way I,

22
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,580
I,
I said occasionally say this on stage 

23
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,320
even when there's no joke,
but when I'm just angry about it,

24
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,530
Stevia is an artificial sweetener and 
it's a big scam where you,

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,880
there's no artificial sweeteners because
you hate getting that fucking aspartame 

26
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:12,780
taste.

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,780
Right.
And then.

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,340
But then they have Stevia in it because 
it's natural and it still tastes like 

29
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:19,710
shit.
So you're thinking,

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,340
oh good.
It's no artificial sweeteners.

31
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,600
That means it's not,
oh,

32
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:26,790
it still tastes like shit,
but it's,

33
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,030
it's natural shit.
Have you ever had a soda?

34
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,720
No,
but I'm assuming it's Steve.

35
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,770
You nailed it.
They figured it out.

36
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,240
They really did.
That's good.

37
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,820
The,
it's not Dr.

38
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,600
perhaps skeptical you should be.
You've been burned before.

39
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,850
It's not a,
it's not coca cola,

40
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,310
but because it's,
it tastes lighter.

41
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,810
I like it a lot though.
It's good.

42
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,030
I don't think we have any here doing or 
out.

43
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,610
We should get some.
But uh,

44
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,130
that's one of the Stevia ones.
That's good.

45
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,120
This,
it's different.

46
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,280
There's different Stevia to like,
this stuff's TV Steve.

47
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,760
I just generally don't drink things that
have sugar or need sugar.

48
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,870
I unsweetened iced tea is fantastic.
Uh,

49
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:15,710
or if it's just juice,
like with vodka I put,

50
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,120
I use vodka soda with just a tiny splash
of either grapefruit or so.

51
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:25,230
There's almost no sugar in it anyway.
I don't drink fucking Coca Cola.

52
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:30,410
I'll put a splash in a whiskey but tiny 
where if I get fucking hammered on 

53
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:32,910
Whiskey,
I probably drank,

54
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,160
you know,
four ounces of coke.

55
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,500
So it's health benefits.
Just avoid sugar.

56
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,200
Yeah.
It fucks up your whiskey here.

57
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,190
How's things in Brisbane or you're the 
mayor yet?

58
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,420
No,
we,

59
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,790
we're trying to.
We're trying to find someone to run.

60
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,820
I would be the worst.
It's,

61
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,280
I wouldn't be like,
uh,

62
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:59,281
uh,
doing a cruise ship comedy where you 

63
00:02:59,281 --> 00:02:59,281
know,
the,

64
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:02,350
the worst about a cruise ship would be 
if you sucked.

65
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,530
And then you have to be in the buffet 
line with everyone who saw you suck in 

66
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,700
the whole week.
You're around people who saw you suck.

67
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,030
That would be the mayor of bisbee where 
half the town hates you for because 

68
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:17,680
you're not supporting whatever stupid 
fucking.

69
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,670
And you have to see them at Safeway.
Does your town have a split?

70
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,830
Is there like a conservative side of 
your town and the Liberals?

71
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,700
That's what makes it work,
but it's not usually a,

72
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,180
your,
your usual dynamic of conservative and 

73
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,280
liberal.
It's not a,

74
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,310
we hate queers.
It's a of the plastic bag ban.

75
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,430
Well,
you can't tell us we can't have plastic 

76
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,430
bags,
but they're bad for the environment.

77
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,830
Will ask here because I'm used to 
getting a plastic bag and yeah,

78
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,900
they did.
They split over just minutia and silly 

79
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,031
shit.
That bothers you in a small town in the 

80
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:00,031
town.
5,000

81
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,840
Jesus Christ.
That's so little.

82
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,480
Yeah.
That's amazing.

83
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,510
That's really good.
Do they leave you alone?

84
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,930
Are the past still bother you?
Show up at your house all the time.

85
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:11,940
Oh God.
Yeah,

86
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,080
but not people that live there.
Oh,

87
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:17,100
just my friends that come over.
You are.

88
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,030
That's weird too.
Right?

89
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,980
They just,
they know they'd go to busy and they can

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,020
be like,
this is the move.

91
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,720
Yeah,
I know.

92
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,710
There's no more of that.
Like an open door.

93
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:31,711
Football.
We don't even do football parties 

94
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:31,711
anymore.
Gave it up.

95
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:33,520
Yeah.
Too Weird to too many people.

96
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:38,521
Just even locals.
I ended up hosting the whole time and 

97
00:04:38,521 --> 00:04:40,060
never watching football and yeah,
that's the problem.

98
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:41,830
Right?
And fucking clean up.

99
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,470
You know,
you get,

100
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,810
you know if 15 people over and no one's 
thrown aware,

101
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,760
they're fucking beer cans.
Shit.

102
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,280
So yeah,
there's a lot of dishes or they worse,

103
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,330
they'd bring food,
everyone would bring food after awhile 

104
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:00,400
and,
but then they'd leave the,

105
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,150
the pan.
So you have to scrub a fucking casserole

106
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:08,230
pan and then try to remember who brought
it so you can get it back.

107
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,120
That small town living.
Is that case still for sale?

108
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:18,510
Yes it is.
You still interested if everything goes 

109
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:18,510
wrong.
That's where I'm going.

110
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,090
God,
I found another house.

111
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:24,091
It's even better because right at the 
end of the runway of the municipal 

112
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,760
airport.
So if you had your own little four 

113
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,460
seater Cessna fucking bill burn his 
helicopter.

114
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:35,050
Like it had four airplane hangar like 
parking spaces.

115
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:40,051
So you could fly in park right in the 
house and it was like 2,900

116
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:45,181
square feet.
They were asking like 400 for it and it 

117
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:49,681
had indoors.
It had its own like giant airplane 

118
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:53,890
hangar that goes right up to a bar where
you could make a stage in their shows.

119
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,840
That's the one.
Ah,

120
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,700
so it's right at the airport.
Hear other people picture.

121
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,900
Dude,
that's a fucking nice house.

122
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:07,400
That,
that is the runway.

123
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:07,940
Oh wait,
no,

124
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:10,920
that's the highway.
The runway is to the.

125
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,140
Go to the next picture.

126
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,560
Jamie will do this.
This fucking house is nice.

127
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,960
Her under this point.
His Dad,

128
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,690
they flip houses,
his parents.

129
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:25,610
So they came down and uh,
they went through fucking gorgeous.

130
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:27,980
This is only 400 grand or you could get 
it for less.

131
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,780
Wow.
It's been a for 99.

132
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,610
Yeah,
it's beautiful.

133
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,590
Dad was saying you could probably get it
for three slash 75.

134
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,650
The only problem is it's county and not 
city.

135
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,100
So it's got the except Dick and shit.
I'm the worst homeowner ever.

136
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,160
I can't do anything.
And you started putting that like septic

137
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:54,161
on me.
I had a septic and one of my old houses 

138
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:54,161
and uh,
the,

139
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:57,680
the,
the pump broke and then a first the 

140
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,791
toilet bowl started back up and then the
tub started filling up with piss and 

141
00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:03,710
shit.
Fun Times.

142
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,180
It's like all of a sudden we're in the 
the bathroom downstairs in the tub 

143
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,400
starts filling up with like what in the 
fuck is going on and what it was.

144
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,050
This Colorado knows when I was in the 
hills there was a,

145
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,910
had a house in,
there was a septic tank,

146
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:24,911
was slightly above the house,
see had a pump to get to the septic 

147
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:28,511
tank.
So you would pump the waste into the 

148
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:28,511
tank.
It's not a good idea.

149
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,840
Like ideally they always want the tank 
to be below,

150
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:34,841
so it's like a natural flow.
So the pump broke so the tanks are 

151
00:07:34,841 --> 00:07:37,220
backing up into the house.
Fun Times.

152
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:37,730
That's.
Yeah,

153
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,240
that's the things that I wouldn't,
I,

154
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:41,420
I couldn't do it.
If I,

155
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:43,100
if I did,
if I had the money,

156
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:45,260
I would just buy that as.
All right.

157
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:47,170
This is our studio.
We don't look.

158
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,350
Their guests can stay here.
We'll make this into a like a place like

159
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:52,940
this.
Just a great idea.

160
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,150
It would be a fucking airplane.
Douglas,

161
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,710
can you fly?
No,

162
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,570
but I have learned,
but I know a pilot.

163
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,920
Ooh.
Better.

164
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,620
Better than.
He actually has a real gig now.

165
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:04,930
He was,
he would come down,

166
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,890
he was a fan and he would fly into 
Bisbee from Tucson just to get his hours

167
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,280
because to get his commercial license.
And uh,

168
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,010
he came to a not a super bowl party.
We,

169
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,440
we,
the last special I taped,

170
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:24,230
he came down,
flew down with a bunch of his friends.

171
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:27,000
We taped it in business,
be my last special and uh,

172
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,800
so the next morning he flew back over 
the house and he had put Stan and hope 

173
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,580
under each wing and he buzzed our house.
It's very cool.

174
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,460
That's awesome.
Now he's a commercial,

175
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:43,610
a guy for Sky West,
that Delta partner.

176
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,430
And he actually picked me up at the 
airport when I flew.

177
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:51,450
I flew back from Hawaii,
so he was learning how to fly and now 

178
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,850
all of a sudden he's a professional and 
that's how,

179
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:54,540
you know,
he had to build up our.

180
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,870
So we'd these,
you know,

181
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,850
stone yet before you,
you get to fly a jumbo jet 

182
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,790
questionnaires from a lot of questions 
other than,

183
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,530
hey,
can you fly me to la?

184
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:09,531
Like if I needed to,
do you want to talk about under 

185
00:09:09,531 --> 00:09:11,920
appreciated people,
the people that know how to pilot the 

186
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,100
planes 1500 hours.
That's it.

187
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,670
And they make Dick for money.
I never read those stories were like in 

188
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,541
New York where they have these like 
single rooms with like eight bunk beds,

189
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,880
pilots living in there when they have to
lay over because you can't afford what 

190
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:36,680
does this Jamie for?
And 200 and $1,500

191
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:39,900
for hours on the 2:50
for commercial sites.

192
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,340
I think that's non transporting people 
maybe 250 hours of flight time.

193
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,890
That doesn't seem like a lot.
Remember what?

194
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:51,970
How bad he drived when you're 20,
how bad did you drive when you were 20?

195
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,730
Pretty good.
It was terrible.

196
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,470
I remember driving piece of Shit cars 
with no worries.

197
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,650
Like now just to go to the store,
I'd go,

198
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:07,651
we're not going to make a on this car.
I bought A.

199
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:10,750
I used to buy a lot of shitty cars,
delivered newspapers in,

200
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,200
so I'd buy a car for like 300 bucks and 
just beat it into the ground and get rid

201
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:17,410
of it.
I would do that when I lived on the road

202
00:10:17,411 --> 00:10:22,411
and doing like tripled gigs where I 
didn't have to drive 11 hours from 

203
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:28,170
Arizona to southern Wyoming and hope the
car makes and you can see the ground 

204
00:10:32,351 --> 00:10:35,020
through the passenger side floor is 
rusted out.

205
00:10:35,021 --> 00:10:39,100
You can actually see pavement.
Let me drive those cars,

206
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,200
you know,
forever until they died and then 

207
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,200
hitchhiked to the next town and hope you
know,

208
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,080
a comic there that can get you to the 
city for the Gig.

209
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:51,310
Could you have ever imagined when you 
were 21 or however old you were when you

210
00:10:51,311 --> 00:10:53,160
first started doing the road?
They wouldn't.

211
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,350
He would look back on those horrible 
nights with likeness stalled.

212
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,470
I,
I knew it then.

213
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:02,200
I knew it was nostalgic then.
I didn't,

214
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,870
I was shamed.
I didn't,

215
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,010
I didn't.
Uh,

216
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,410
I didn't think it was.
I just like,

217
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:09,790
I'm a loser.
Yeah.

218
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:14,890
I wasn't enjoying it at all.
I think there's probably a big 

219
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:18,121
difference between doing it on the East 
Coast and Boston and congestion rather 

220
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:23,410
than the great wide open of Montana and 
Idaho.

221
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:27,070
And that's a part of the shows are 
probably bleaker though.

222
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,090
Like we had shows like you would do a 
lot of road gigs,

223
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:36,091
but they were good gigs.
Like they weren't like the boom of the 

224
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:39,340
late eighties.
I started in 88 and I started doing gigs

225
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:42,790
on the road hell gigs on the road and 
probably like 89.

226
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,120
And um,
there was a lot of gigs back then that 

227
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,120
were really good.
You would go somewhere,

228
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,710
there'll be 300 people.
It'd be a great crowd,

229
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,470
you know,
150 people in a bar there.

230
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,050
They love comedy night.
Like some of them were really good,

231
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,950
but it's just the,
the never knowing if you're going to 

232
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,960
make enough money to pay the bills and 
the stress of being poor.

233
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,110
I didn't have a lot of bills living on 
in my car.

234
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,810
Well that's the way.
There's a lot of downtime at a lot of,

235
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:12,180
uh,
you know,

236
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,200
a questionable choices in ladies just 
because he needed a place to stay for 

237
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,930
days before El Paso.
Dangerous Gigolo days.

238
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,590
Shaved a little tug,
Stan hope.

239
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,300
Yeah.
You try the travel on the road thing.

240
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:30,100
So,
such a,

241
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,970
you get a view of the country that if 
you really stop and think about it,

242
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:36,380
like how many different places you've 
been and your,

243
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,270
your understanding of America,
like you've been everywhere.

244
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,040
You've been all the,
all the different spots.

245
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,030
Get a chance.
Okay.

246
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:44,740
This is how they rock it over here.
All right.

247
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,840
This is how they do it in Detroit.
This is how they are.

248
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:48,640
New Orleans is different.
Oh,

249
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:51,350
Connecticut's a little different.
And then you put it all together.

250
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:56,400
You get America.
But if you just like a dude who just 

251
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,120
like parks it in Columbus,
Ohio and fucking that's that.

252
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:02,870
And all you know is CNN and tmz go,
this is what the,

253
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:08,270
this is what the country's coming lives.
These fucking lubes with fucking do 

254
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,040
rules.
Yeah.

255
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,550
When you,
when you're out amongst people,

256
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:15,100
no one really gives a fuck.
No one gives a fuck.

257
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,950
It's barred chatter at best,
but it's.

258
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,360
You've never run into people that are 
actually affected.

259
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,580
No,
you don't unless you're looking for it.

260
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,740
Yeah,
no.

261
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,260
Most of the time it's a nonissue what?

262
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,760
It's the most,
most pressing issue because it's.

263
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,180
It can shift the country one way or 
another.

264
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,220
That's what's weird about it.
No one gives a fuck about the things 

265
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,921
that actually affect them locally.
The thing that sets that guy off to 

266
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:48,121
bitch about trump or bitch about hillary
is he forgot to move his car on street 

267
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:50,890
sweeping day,
but he never goes down to petition.

268
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:52,450
City Council about,
hey,

269
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:55,180
this is fucked up.
That stop sign was obscured,

270
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,900
your honor,
and I,

271
00:13:56,901 --> 00:14:00,370
I wouldn't have run the stop sign,
but there's a fucking branch in front of

272
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:05,371
it and you need to cut that down and I 
get a ticket and I can't afford the 

273
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:08,821
ticket,
and it's the economy fucking trump or 

274
00:14:08,821 --> 00:14:10,270
whatever.
They just bring it to the highest level.

275
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:15,690
Well,
one of the things that I've realized by 

276
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:15,690
talking to people that really understand
how things work,

277
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,100
like economics,
like talk to Peter Schiff yesterday,

278
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:21,490
the economist,
he had them on my podcast.

279
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,030
Really interesting guy.
No,

280
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,240
no,
no.

281
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,900
He's a fun guy.
He like you.

282
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,980
You could talk to him.
He's never drunk and busy.

283
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,550
He would get drunk.
Yeah.

284
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:30,940
No,
he,

285
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,290
he,
he's a really smart guy.

286
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,000
I mean,
he's a very successful guy,

287
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:35,770
but he's right there.
He's right there.

288
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,290
Like when you talked to them,
like I first time we did a show,

289
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,320
we've got drunk.
We decided to have a couple of drinks 

290
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:43,320
and lighten up because he was doing this
like Fox News,

291
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,400
CNN thing they do where they have these 
five minute panels.

292
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,560
We just have to rattle off statistics.
You've got to tell the people.

293
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,620
The problem was economics.
The problem is it like he's a wizard.

294
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:51,980
That shit.
We got to calm them

295
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,510
down.
My two,

296
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,160
we're here for a long time and so let's 
get a drink.

297
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,930
Let's get a drink,
have a little Jack Daniels.

298
00:14:56,931 --> 00:15:00,290
Then they loosened up,
but he set up a video that said,

299
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,920
uh,
I'm the one percent asked me,

300
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,570
asked me anything.
Is that what you said?

301
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,130
Something like that.
Something like that.

302
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:12,190
So went to occupy Wall Street and set up
a finger just talking to people about 

303
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:12,470
economics,
like,

304
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:14,150
Nora,
this is why you think it works.

305
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,850
This is how it really works.
This is what I realized.

306
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:21,851
Talking to people like that,
there's no fucking way you could be on 

307
00:15:21,851 --> 00:15:25,121
the ball with all this stuff with 
Congress and the Senate and all the 

308
00:15:25,121 --> 00:15:26,540
stuff that goes on behind the scenes and
lobbyists.

309
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,120
He would have to be fully immersed in 
it.

310
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,360
You would have to be fully immersed in 
it and then fully immersed in the stock 

311
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,271
market to have any kind of an argument 
one way or another and most people are 

312
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:41,801
just having these halfassed half cocked 
shitty thought out arguments about 

313
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:45,890
almost everything they talk about,
including me,

314
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,840
including especially on this podcast 
many,

315
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,410
many times,
but this is something that we.

316
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,050
It's standard.
There's too much shit to.

317
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:55,730
No,
there's too much fucking.

318
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,270
When it comes to politics,
like you pretend to understand politics,

319
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:05,271
like how long have been trying to 
unravel this Russia thing again tuned 

320
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:06,140
out completely.
I know.

321
00:16:06,141 --> 00:16:09,140
I don't know and I don't care enough to 
try to learn.

322
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,610
I get to a place.
I went through a period of,

323
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,270
you know,
a bag bagging,

324
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,790
our conspiracy theory days and then I 
learned a little bit,

325
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:24,791
but anything that's.
I really don't know how government 

326
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:25,640
works.
It's so hard to know.

327
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:30,790
It's so hard to know.
It's just elementary school fucking,

328
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,050
you know,
the,

329
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,310
the,
you know,

330
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:38,410
I'm just a bill on Capitol Hill.
I still don't even know what that 

331
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:41,561
fucking men stopped talking.
Probably paying attention to it more 

332
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:43,370
than most people.
Most people just for a minute.

333
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,630
Most people,
the president or anybody just represents

334
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:50,300
what they like.
Like I like a nice guy.

335
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,910
Oh,
I like a no bullshit guy.

336
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:58,370
Okay.
And then you just find whoever's best 

337
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,770
fits that mold and you supply the 
president who is the most popular.

338
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,350
Yeah.
It's fascinating though.

339
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:04,400
I.
Yeah.

340
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,520
I think if a trump was any

341
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,750
republican that wasn't a fucking 
asshole,

342
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:16,570
but stood for the same principles,
there would be no outrage.

343
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:21,190
They hate his personality first,
which I'm not against you.

344
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,240
He's,
yeah,

345
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,030
he's a fucking loser.
But he's the one you created.

346
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,490
We were just talking about,
uh,

347
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,180
and I,
I mentioned it on stage here and again,

348
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:36,181
that trump makes me happy sometimes in 
that he's a product of everything.

349
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:43,050
Like a,
what's that levy on ball that fucking 

350
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:43,990
like basketball dad.
Oh yeah.

351
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,650
He's famous just because he's a fucking 
asshole and he knows,

352
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,120
hey,
if I keep being a fucking,

353
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,330
the more I'm going to get noticed.
And Ann Coulter who just says,

354
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:57,750
or Tom like is,
or the news we were just talking about,

355
00:17:57,751 --> 00:18:01,920
you had the new job.
People say outrageous things just to get

356
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:03,070
attention to,
um,

357
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:08,110
tenants.
You feed the trolls and then all of a 

358
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:08,110
sudden you elect a troll.
So fuck you.

359
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,160
It's all you.
People that watch TMZ and fucking buy a 

360
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,470
tabloid because fucking so said 
something outrageous again,

361
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,790
but it's a natural instinct to do that.
You know,

362
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,530
I was telling you before the show,
Ted nugent is a nice guy.

363
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,230
He's like a really nice guy.
God.

364
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:29,270
Do you remember trolling his message 
board from your message for you trolled 

365
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:33,581
his message board and you were.
You were giving instructions on how 

366
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:33,930
other people should trolls message 
board.

367
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,980
I,
they were.

368
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:38,720
They were so like they were Magda before
MCA was mega,

369
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
like they were make America great.
I had a bit about it in my act about not

370
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:47,540
needing the draft.
He just show up at Ted nugent concert at

371
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:52,550
scoop him up in nets.
It was something along the way that 

372
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,290
they're going to take away nascar

373
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,950
and I forgot that bit,
but it was even have a message board are

374
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:04,970
they know,
do they even exist because your message 

375
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:09,401
board would troll and I,
I got on board with the trolling Ted 

376
00:19:09,401 --> 00:19:12,320
nugent's message board and I would 
passive aggressively.

377
00:19:12,321 --> 00:19:17,321
I would backhand insult him by going,
hey,

378
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:23,140
we got a,
we got a band together and get the news 

379
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,240
back on the airways.
It's no fair.

380
00:19:23,241 --> 00:19:24,560
All these,
uh,

381
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:29,740
you know,
rage against the machine wannabes are 

382
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,870
getting all the airplay and when I 
called the request,

383
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:35,150
true rock and roll legend like Ted 
Nugent,

384
00:19:35,151 --> 00:19:40,151
they laughed me off the phone and it's 
no fair that all these guys are selling 

385
00:19:40,151 --> 00:19:44,801
out arenas and Ted nugent is stuck at 
some state fair play beside it.

386
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,620
Tilt a whirlwind and Andy Gump,
a handful of people.

387
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,680
So I'm like,
I'm pro routing people to get nugent 

388
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,440
more notice,
but at the same time he's playing 35 

389
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,810
people at the fucking Arkansas state 
fair.

390
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:07,500
It's.
Nope.

391
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,420
And he dancer you.
Yeah.

392
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,650
By the way,
I played a lot more than people.

393
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,360
That was the early days of people.
An understanding message boards.

394
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,570
I understand how they work.
That's right.

395
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,100
I'm glad he never brought that up.
I have,

396
00:20:29,101 --> 00:20:34,101
I wouldn't have been able to defend it 
and say,

397
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,530
yeah,
well that's Doug.

398
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,430
What are you going to do?
He's my friend.

399
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,870
Sorry Dude.
I,

400
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,710
uh,
I think,

401
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:43,830
I think

402
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,730
what we're talking about before is that 
a lot of people are nice people.

403
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,980
They,
that this is

404
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,010
their act.
Their act is say outrageous things.

405
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:56,250
Get people to pay attention to them and 
then that it becomes such a lousy trick 

406
00:20:56,621 --> 00:21:01,621
though.
I've just feel like it's so fucking 

407
00:21:01,621 --> 00:21:01,621
lazy.
Well,

408
00:21:01,621 --> 00:21:06,271
I think it's not all that.
It's like they believed that and they 

409
00:21:06,271 --> 00:21:09,550
also like,
I believe Ted believes most of what he's

410
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:14,551
saying,
but I think you also says things in an 

411
00:21:14,551 --> 00:21:15,940
outrageous manner because that's part of
his showbiz style.

412
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,160
Like he's the motor city madman,
you know,

413
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:19,060
he's,
he's a,

414
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:24,270
he's a wild motherfucker is going to 
tell you like it is and he believes a 

415
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,140
lot of what he says and he makes sense 
about many things.

416
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,840
But then he goes,
he goes,

417
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:29,760
Haywire,
what sti?

418
00:21:29,761 --> 00:21:31,000
But when you're with them,
you're like,

419
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,170
Oh,
you're a nice guy.

420
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,070
Like he's a genuinely nice guy.
It as much as he says crazy shit.

421
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,360
He's got his,
you know,

422
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,980
he believes he supporting the 
intelligent side of the message that you

423
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:45,130
should be able to have guns if you're a 
responsible law abiding person.

424
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,350
And part of me is like,
yeah,

425
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,760
you shouldn't be.
Yeah.

426
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,820
But maybe you know,
maybe the problem is just like we were 

427
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:53,820
talking about people running for 
president,

428
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,530
you don't really get the nuance stance 
of who a person is from these campaign 

429
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,890
ads or debates or anything.
You just get.

430
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,920
You get this image is flash thing when 
if you got to know almost everybody's 

431
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:10,170
alright if you get to know him,
I'd say he has no reason to have his 

432
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:15,841
opinion.
Like he has to be a dick just to keep 

433
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:19,561
himself like Kilroy and kind of say 
Rachel Jones would be like Alex Jones is

434
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:26,731
a guy who may be now he believes more 
than he should have bought his own 

435
00:22:26,731 --> 00:22:26,731
bullshit.

436
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,890
But he created that.
Like that's what he.

437
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,400
He created his own art form and made 
himself.

438
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,640
Ted nugent is a guy who had two shitty 
songs in 1977 stranglehold is like I am 

439
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,830
desperate to stay in the spotlight.
He's like a Kathy Griffin,

440
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:49,000
like clawing who look at me,
please notice me.

441
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,740
I'm still relevant.
Right?

442
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,900
But they go to them for opinions,
man.

443
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,430
I mean there's,
there's a reason why,

444
00:22:54,431 --> 00:22:56,350
like anytime there's a gun control 
debate,

445
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,600
they go to Ted nugent was going to say 
the outrageous thing.

446
00:22:59,601 --> 00:23:00,940
His Dad,
he's good at it,

447
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:01,250
man.
I.

448
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,280
It's easy to write them off like that.
The problem is like when he debates 

449
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,381
people about gun control,
he knows to actual statistics and the 

450
00:23:10,381 --> 00:23:14,221
actual statistics are confusing because 
you find out that this had a gun 

451
00:23:14,221 --> 00:23:18,151
violence deaths,
a giant chunk of them are suicide and 

452
00:23:18,151 --> 00:23:20,500
then there's gang violence as the other 
ones and then it gets down to actual gun

453
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:22,720
violence and then the numbers,
they're,

454
00:23:22,721 --> 00:23:23,310
they're,
they're,

455
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:28,410
they're weird.
They're not what you would want them to 

456
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:28,410
be.
You want it to be cut and dry.

457
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:32,221
Like people are using guns and crimes of
passion and school shootings and that's 

458
00:23:32,221 --> 00:23:33,220
why there's guns need to take them off 
the table.

459
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:38,221
But man,
a lot of what we attributed deaths are 

460
00:23:38,221 --> 00:23:38,230
suicides.
It's fucking dark.

461
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:40,120
How many people pull the trigger,
you know,

462
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:43,330
and a lot of gun violence is that.
And then there's.

463
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,310
We were talking about Chicago,
how crazy Chicago

464
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,450
is.
What was the number again?

465
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,610
1,000.
What was it?

466
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:54,770
I don't know because I had another stat 
that I was waiting to pull up that day 

467
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,670
that was crazier to me in debt and not 
from like 1970,

468
00:23:55,671 --> 00:24:00,671
roughly about 89.
The murders in New York City was almost 

469
00:24:00,671 --> 00:24:02,330
triple.
That is like 2,245

470
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:03,350
was the highest.
Oh yeah.

471
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:05,000
In the seventies.
New York was crazy.

472
00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:06,510
Yeah,
it was like average or eight.

473
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,740
Eight,
900 I think in Chicago is what it is.

474
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,440
But there was one year that was 1500 in 
a year,

475
00:24:12,441 --> 00:24:12,860
right?
Yeah,

476
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:13,370
I think so.
Yeah.

477
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:14,660
There's one particularly high

478
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,090
and it was,
it's way more than dying in Afghanistan,

479
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,160
way more than dying in Iraq.
You know,

480
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:24,140
it's in Chicago and this is like if for 
whatever reason it's,

481
00:24:24,141 --> 00:24:24,580
it's,
it,

482
00:24:24,581 --> 00:24:26,700
it barely gets our attention.
You know,

483
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,780
guys like him are important for getting 
that message out.

484
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,000
Even if he does it in this fucked up 
way,

485
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,990
like how we need to look at like what 
this thing is like.

486
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:37,940
We definitely have a gun problem in this
country,

487
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,330
but I don't know.
I don't,

488
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,930
I don't think either side is right about
what it is.

489
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,200
I think we have a fucking human problem.
The fact that humans are just running 

490
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,801
around shooting people is the problem.
It's not the fact that we're smart 

491
00:24:50,801 --> 00:24:50,801
enough to figure out guns.

492
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,690
Well,
every time a me and Chad shank get drunk

493
00:24:54,691 --> 00:24:57,330
and have one of these conversations late
into the night,

494
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:01,380
it always boils down to overpopulation.
There's too many people.

495
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,440
Whatever the issue is,
somehow we can always boil it down to 

496
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,110
yeah,
but there's too many fucking people.

497
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,490
Well for sure

498
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:14,590
it's.
We don't value people when the numbers 

499
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:14,590
are so high.
You're supposed to,

500
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,750
you value your close knit group of 
friends.

501
00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:21,751
Right?
That's the romantic thing when there's 

502
00:25:21,751 --> 00:25:22,660
20 million people and you can't get 
anywhere like La.

503
00:25:22,661 --> 00:25:23,980
You don't value people's.

504
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,770
Yeah.
Did a bit of bug that you love.

505
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,840
You love a kitten and if you get a pet 
kitten and he would come home every 

506
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,360
night.
Oh Mr Ben goes,

507
00:25:33,361 --> 00:25:38,361
you make me so happy.
But if you came back to that same 

508
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:38,361
bachelor apartment,
have,

509
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:42,990
you know,
300 square feet and there were 800 

510
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:43,590
kittens in there,
you couldn't kill kittens quick enough.

511
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,390
Like,
get this,

512
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,670
get my golf shoes,
stomping kittens,

513
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,060
these fucking things.
And people are the same.

514
00:25:51,061 --> 00:25:53,580
It's just like currency.
Yeah.

515
00:25:53,581 --> 00:25:57,810
Well that's why what you've done as a 
wise move by moving to a town of 5,000,

516
00:25:57,811 --> 00:25:59,170
that's very managed.
Going to love it.

517
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,980
I know one my neighbors.
Yeah.

518
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,430
It's a very manageable to like what 
you've chosen to do is.

519
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,610
It's smart.
I don't think big cities are manageable.

520
00:26:08,611 --> 00:26:13,611
I think people just put their blinders 
on and they just get weird to just get 

521
00:26:13,611 --> 00:26:13,611
weird.

522
00:26:13,611 --> 00:26:14,930
And some people say,
well I get energy from the city.

523
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:16,950
I'm like,
I totally get that.

524
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,960
You go to New York City.
I totally get it.

525
00:26:18,961 --> 00:26:20,310
You walk around as a bug.

526
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,920
So many people,
it's above it.

527
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,860
It's dreadful to me.
Yeah.

528
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,090
But I just,
I get,

529
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,280
I get a buzz of anger and murder.
It doesn't bother me that much,

530
00:26:29,281 --> 00:26:30,680
but it does overwhelm me.
I,

531
00:26:30,681 --> 00:26:33,750
I'm very claustrophobic.
And the more I age,

532
00:26:33,751 --> 00:26:37,070
the more things like it just gets worse.
Well,

533
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,590
it's also such a direct contrast to the 
way you live,

534
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,060
you know.
But I,

535
00:26:42,061 --> 00:26:43,050
I've always,

536
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,710
yeah.
Hey,

537
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,780
I just going out to smoke a cigarette 
and you can't,

538
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
like,
you're afraid you're going to burn 

539
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,210
someone because you've sublet your 
personal space and walking that close to

540
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:59,211
you.
You try to get in a door jamb just so 

541
00:26:59,211 --> 00:26:59,940
you don't burn the fucking pedestrian 
with your cigarette.

542
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:05,090
There's no way out of it.
There's no way a thin in that out 

543
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,721
either,
unless they make it so outrageously 

544
00:27:08,721 --> 00:27:10,230
expensive that literally people can't.
They are trying.

545
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:15,260
I mean that's the crazy thing is so many
people want to be there and there's so 

546
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,351
many people there that they could just 
keep jacking the rents up and jacking 

547
00:27:18,351 --> 00:27:19,710
the real estate payments up.

548
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,410
What I was saying about Ted nugent and 
you were saying about,

549
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:30,411
uh,
Tom Lucas and a lot of these other 

550
00:27:30,411 --> 00:27:30,720
people and it's,
it's,

551
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,500
it's really easy to write somebody off.
You know,

552
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:39,530
it's really easy to write people off.
I'm trying to do less of that because 

553
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,701
like I'm trying to get to a point like 
when do you let someone when you like 

554
00:27:43,701 --> 00:27:48,280
one day,
when do you decide on recently though 

555
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:48,510
was someone's like,
yeah,

556
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:53,511
I don't,
I don't like him anymore because he now 

557
00:27:53,511 --> 00:27:56,470
has so and so on his podcast.
Like you had someone that just some 

558
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:59,820
random person was for everybody.
There's a person like that.

559
00:27:59,821 --> 00:28:04,821
For some people it's a hardcore left 
deal is someone I know they didn't even 

560
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:07,980
listen to the fucking show,
but like Jordan Peterson was at him.

561
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,510
Is he like a fucking Nazi guy or 
something?

562
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,480
Got All the writers.

563
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,100
Sometimes people think he is,
but he probably wasn't him.

564
00:28:17,101 --> 00:28:20,550
It was probably someone more 
controversial like Ben Shapiro or Steven

565
00:28:20,551 --> 00:28:23,520
crowder or one of those guys would.
None of them are Nazis,

566
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:28,940
you know,
and Jordan Peterson is much more of a 

567
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:28,940
centrist than anything.
He's not right.

568
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,120
He's,
he's more of a,

569
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,440
he,
they call it,

570
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:32,640
you know,
what a classic liberal,

571
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,350
classic liberal is,
you know,

572
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:39,380
the idea of the treating people as the 
individual instead of collective into 

573
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,410
sort of a group instead of identifying 
with a group of whatever,

574
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,440
no matter what it is,
treat people as individuals and he's a 

575
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,480
big proponent of personal responsibility
and treating people as individuals.

576
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:56,690
And because of that and because of some 
of the things he said about they're 

577
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:00,130
trying to enforce a pronouns for 
transgender people,

578
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,190
the ones that they made up like a bunch 
of them.

579
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,190
Uh,
there was a bill that was a human rights

580
00:29:05,191 --> 00:29:06,950
violation thing,
you know,

581
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:10,920
because they have that human rights 
council in Canada and it was,

582
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,010
he was arguing,
is this a slippery slope?

583
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:19,011
You can't,
you can't compel people to use made up 

584
00:29:19,011 --> 00:29:19,320
words.
Can't just decide that you're gonna make

585
00:29:19,321 --> 00:29:24,321
up a bunch of gender pronouns.
And they get people to say there's like 

586
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,830
78 of them apparently that facebook 
excepts right?

587
00:29:27,831 --> 00:29:28,830
There's C,
H,

588
00:29:28,831 --> 00:29:30,630
I r,
C I r e.

589
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,030
there's just make them up like anybody 
can make them up.

590
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,590
What you want this?
Oh yeah.

591
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,030
Um,
yeah.

592
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,060
And so because it's controversial 
because people said,

593
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,710
Oh,
you're picking on trans people.

594
00:29:40,711 --> 00:29:41,200
And he's like,
no,

595
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:42,100
I'm not.
No,

596
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,920
I,
I fully support your right to be a trans

597
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:49,921
person.
I just don't want to use these bloody 

598
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,651
made up words is what he was saying.
And he felt like this is a slippery 

599
00:29:52,651 --> 00:29:56,671
slope to controlling people's behavior 
and it starts like this and they shame 

600
00:29:56,671 --> 00:29:58,750
you into thinking their way and there's 
a group think part of it involved.

601
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,590
So because of that,
he got so lumped into um,

602
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,170
this all right idea that,
oh,

603
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:07,270
he's the guy who hates transgender 
people.

604
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:09,370
It's just like we were talking about 
like people running for president.

605
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,340
You don't really get to see who the real
person is.

606
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,870
He get to see this surface.
Oh,

607
00:30:13,871 --> 00:30:15,670
he's the no nonsense guy.
I'll take them.

608
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,650
And that's what they do with him.
I'll go,

609
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:19,990
he's the guy who hates transgender 
folks.

610
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,130
It doesn't at all.

611
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,310
If you really wanted to,
like,

612
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,860
you would never know,
uh,

613
00:30:25,861 --> 00:30:30,180
candidates true intentions.
If they were a good candidate,

614
00:30:30,181 --> 00:30:33,060
if they were a crafty politician,
they would.

615
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,580
I would go out and say whatever the 
fuck,

616
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,440
if you know,
if it worked for trump,

617
00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:39,660
I'll do it better and I'll say shit like
that,

618
00:30:39,661 --> 00:30:44,661
and then I'll just be lying.
I'm going to deport everyone holocaust 

619
00:30:46,381 --> 00:30:47,730
three,
whatever they want to hear,

620
00:30:47,731 --> 00:30:50,610
and then you'd go and God just kidding.
And then you do the right thing.

621
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,790
Yeah.
I was kinda hoping trump would.

622
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:57,860
I think you could manipulate his ego to 
a point where he could get them to do 

623
00:30:58,861 --> 00:31:01,200
your bidding just by saying,
oh,

624
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:03,300
you're getting good numbers by doing 
this,

625
00:31:03,301 --> 00:31:05,250
and they,
the left hates this.

626
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:10,460
So yeah,
you should legalize marijuana and he 

627
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:10,460
wouldn't.
He wouldn't need logic.

628
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,380
You just need to have his ego fed and 
he'd do all the right things.

629
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,020
I think that's what he's holding in his 
back pocket.

630
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:21,050
The legalized marijuana.
I think as we get closer to the 

631
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,861
election,
I think he makes marijuana federally 

632
00:31:24,861 --> 00:31:27,171
illegal and I think he does that.
The stoners just fucking raise their 

633
00:31:27,171 --> 00:31:28,470
arms in the air and they go,
fuck it.

634
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:31,170
I'm going with trump.
Do you just know how much that'll change

635
00:31:31,171 --> 00:31:32,490
the world?
Just that.

636
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,830
And they still won't vote.
Yeah,

637
00:31:34,831 --> 00:31:39,831
they still won't vote.
I know a lot of people complained it 

638
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:39,831
didn't vote.

639
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:39,831
Ooh,

640
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,420
well Haley,
I don't.

641
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:46,840
I don't think I voted.
I know.

642
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,970
I know I did because I always a vote

643
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,280
should be able to vote online.
To be very simple.

644
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:59,340
Should be a thing.
You fill out your social security card 

645
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:03,120
number.
You use a face id thing from a fucking 

646
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,120
laptop.
You could do it on your phone

647
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,070
calling an 800 number,
like American idol.

648
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,650
That's,

649
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:12,740
you know.
I think it'd be nice if you knew for 

650
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,011
sure and it's.
Most people have a laptop with a camera 

651
00:32:16,011 --> 00:32:17,100
on it or a web camera somewhere.
They're not hard.

652
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,290
You get a USB web camera,
they're cheap.

653
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:24,150
They're pretty cheap now and you just do
that and you've fucking vote that way.

654
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:29,180
That wouldn't be hard to do.
They been able to come up with software 

655
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:29,280
that could read your face,
no fits you.

656
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:35,020
A lot of a lot of laptops.
Even at fingerprint sensors now you 

657
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,720
could fucking vote online.
They don't want it to.

658
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:39,000
It's too they want is difficult and 
confusing.

659
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,980
Possible.
They want to

660
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,230
keep it this convoluted.
Maggie,

661
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:47,260
to take time off of work.
They want you to just go like this all 

662
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:47,780
the time.
Like what is this?

663
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,940
Who literally do it?
They don't want like smooth sailing.

664
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:54,340
Everything sorted out.
Everybody's doing well now.

665
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,390
They want,
like you were saying how your town works

666
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,100
because you've got left and right.
They want it.

667
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:03,730
They want a little just a little bit 
bait to get people were inside arms at 

668
00:33:03,771 --> 00:33:06,890
safely,
like just just because they can.

669
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,900
It's.
You're in Arizona.

670
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:12,020
Yeah,
so you get that kind of redneck element,

671
00:33:12,021 --> 00:33:17,021
but it's not a.
it's not a trump versus hillary and 

672
00:33:17,021 --> 00:33:20,950
obviously in that small town there's no 
like black lives matter rallies,

673
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,640
but people still go out and protest for 
a red,

674
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:30,641
for Ed,
for the teacher thing and see that side 

675
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,240
on think and work in a limited amount of
people.

676
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:38,030
You know,
if you're walking around midtown 

677
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,320
Manhattan and bumping into people 
everywhere,

678
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:40,730
you got a gun right here.
That shit's not gonna work.

679
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:41,840
You know,
if you're,

680
00:33:41,841 --> 00:33:46,841
if you're a guy was in Arizona,
you just worried about some no wild drug

681
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:50,170
smugglers coming across the border and 
shooting up your city.

682
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,860
You've got to worry about that.
Don't,

683
00:33:51,861 --> 00:33:53,060
you know,
like right there.

684
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,580
Yeah.
But they keep going.

685
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:58,220
It's the whole Carlin bit where he's 
like,

686
00:33:58,221 --> 00:34:02,080
people bitching about their going to 
build a prison in our community and like

687
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,670
if they escape,
they're not going to be hanging around.

688
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,970
It's true going then.
It's true because you're only like seven

689
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:09,500
miles.
I'm sure I did that.

690
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:13,250
A huge injustice.
I'm sure I'm misquoting Carlin,

691
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,230
but something to that effect.
But yeah,

692
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:17,990
you see undocumented aliens getting 
busted,

693
00:34:17,991 --> 00:34:21,950
but there's no fucking drug war shit 
going on.

694
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,240
Yeah.

695
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,470
They confiscate weed out of,
of,

696
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:29,520
you know,
false bottom fake gas tank at the 

697
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,320
checkpoint.
But I know guys who have been camping on

698
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:35,321
the border or camping near the border on
the US side and had run ins with people 

699
00:34:35,811 --> 00:34:36,460
who were,
uh,

700
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,590
coming across.
They said he got.

701
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:42,050
Some of them got real sketchy because 
that's basically,

702
00:34:42,051 --> 00:34:44,870
they're coming across like constantly 
all the time.

703
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,900
And you just,
if you're there,

704
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:50,220
like these guys wanna a deer hunting 
trip and uh,

705
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:53,450
they just said they were just running 
into people all the time.

706
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:55,370
They were looking for water.
They were looking at.

707
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,350
Yeah,
they'll people leave water out,

708
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,620
you know,
where they,

709
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:03,700
they come across a wow.
And like every other house in our 

710
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,321
neighborhood has a humanitarian aid is 
never a crime because you're not 

711
00:35:08,321 --> 00:35:11,990
supposed to fucking leave water out in 
the desert in case someone's dying.

712
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,270
You're not supposed to.
They tell you not to.

713
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:19,630
I don't know exactly what the law is,
but there's placards just like every 

714
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:22,620
election is vote for mayor of Joe and 
vote for bill,

715
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,640
for city council.
There's humanitarian aid is never a 

716
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,851
crime.
And I don't know what the law was or 

717
00:35:30,851 --> 00:35:33,820
what exactly,
but that's some dark shit when you tell 

718
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:37,961
people don't give them water.
Have you seen that video of a border 

719
00:35:37,961 --> 00:35:38,340
patrol people

720
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:43,370
fucking just going out and dumping out 
water that people have left in the 

721
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:46,140
desert and laughing about it.
Like,

722
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:48,390
fuck you.
Oh,

723
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,070
did you see the border patrol agent that
ran over?

724
00:35:53,071 --> 00:35:55,860
The guy that was a video that just came 
out last week.

725
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:59,430
No,
I didn't smell one of the reservations.

726
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,370
One of the Indian reservations on one of
the border patrol roads.

727
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,820
A guy was filming and the car's coming 
right at.

728
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:07,890
He's coming right at me and then it 
fucking.

729
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,940
It hits him and then turns around and he
got it all on tape.

730
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:14,580
The guy that he actually hit me drove 
off.

731
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,750
Jesus Christ.
Some fucking assholes.

732
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,550
Like a lot of people,
assholes gravitate.

733
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:24,000
Just like child molesters gravitate 
towards,

734
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:29,110
you know,
preschool teacher and priest Fuckin 

735
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:32,040
assholes gravitate towards cop and a 
board anywhere they can,

736
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:32,700
you know,

737
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,270
oh,
look at this.

738
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,810
Boom.
Is that him standing up

739
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,300
and now laying down after the border 
patrol fucking runs over him.

740
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,760
That is crazy.

741
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:48,460
Yeah.

742
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,210
That is crazy.

743
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,590
I can't.
I like,

744
00:36:52,591 --> 00:36:56,220
I have a hard time.
I'll get into going down wormholes,

745
00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:00,130
have bad cops and fucking get here.

746
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:04,330
Border Patrol and I hit like that.
I mean that you.

747
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,280
Are you making a decision to shatter a 
person's body?

748
00:37:07,281 --> 00:37:10,280
Probably forever.
You're hitting someone that hard with a.

749
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,190
with a truck that guys got probably 
everything's probably broken.

750
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:18,460
Yeah,
and it's on a dirt road where it's like 

751
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,050
he did it on purpose.
There's no other excuse.

752
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,070
No,
he did it on purpose.

753
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:24,860
Well,
yeah.

754
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:29,930
I have too much hate in my life where I 
go sometimes I just have to ignore shit 

755
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,400
is just wake up in the morning and I get
on newser and I click on fucking cop 

756
00:37:37,351 --> 00:37:42,351
throws a guide through a plate glass 
window kinda shaded beatings and

757
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,020
I,
you know,

758
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:49,110
I've said this a hundred times,
but it's worth repeating.

759
00:37:49,111 --> 00:37:52,140
I don't think most people are qualified 
to be cops.

760
00:37:52,141 --> 00:37:57,141
I think it's a really fucking hard job 
and I think the pressure of it fucks 

761
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:58,610
people up.
Even if they did go into that job will,

762
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,080
if they gravitate towards it because 
they were bullies,

763
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:03,840
which I'm sure a certain percentage do 
sir for.

764
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:06,660
I think for most of them it's just a 
good job and they think they can pull it

765
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:09,390
off.
I met a lot of cops are good guys,

766
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,840
but I think the pressure of that job and
being shot out all the time and worrying

767
00:38:15,421 --> 00:38:20,421
every time you pull somebody over you to
get shot and everybody's seen those 

768
00:38:20,421 --> 00:38:21,960
videos of people pulling people over and
they pull out a gun and killed a cop.

769
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:27,590
There's one that's haunting man.
Guy Pulls over this Vietnam vet and he 

770
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:28,200
starts.

771
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:33,650
He starts screaming for the guy to get 
back in the car and the guy pulls out a 

772
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,160
rifle and the guy just starts shooting 
at him and he gets hit and screaming,

773
00:38:36,161 --> 00:38:38,030
just almost like,
stop it,

774
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,100
stop it,
stop it,

775
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:44,310
and the guy just keeps shooting a cop 
while all this is happening and the 

776
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,080
guy's like screaming for his life on.
This guy's just gunning him down.

777
00:38:46,081 --> 00:38:46,690
You're like,
man,

778
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,900
tell me these cops haven't seen this.
They're all fucked up and it's.

779
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:54,670
It becomes almost like a game and the 
game is I'm trying to score.

780
00:38:54,671 --> 00:38:56,960
I knew it.
It's like you're doing a.

781
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,190
you're playing one on one basketball.
Are you doing Jujitsu or something?

782
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:05,191
You're trying to score on somebody and 
the score on them as I think you're up 

783
00:39:05,191 --> 00:39:05,191
to something.
No good.

784
00:39:05,191 --> 00:39:05,710
Let me see.
Spread your legs.

785
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:06,670
Let me check your body.

786
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,380
What's going on in the car?
What do you got?

787
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,460
What's this?
What's that?

788
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,020
You're trying and if you get it,
oh,

789
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,430
we got it.
Score.

790
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,860
If you don't get it,
fuck swing and a miss,

791
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:20,100
and so you go looking for things to be 
wrong and that person becomes the enemy 

792
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,640
just like you push people on a fucking 
football field or on the other team.

793
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:26,820
That's what you're doing to the people 
that you're supposed to be protecting 

794
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,850
and serving the they become the enemy.
They become the thing that you're trying

795
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:32,851
to score on and it's just stupid.
Monkey Games start playing around in 

796
00:39:32,851 --> 00:39:35,050
people's heads and I think almost 
nobody's qualified for that.

797
00:39:35,051 --> 00:39:37,690
I know of very few like big John 
McCarthy,

798
00:39:37,691 --> 00:39:39,550
the UFC referee.
He was a cop.

799
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,180
Fucking greatest guy ever want to meet 
the nicest guy ever,

800
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:47,190
but he's also a big giant dude who's not
intimidated by people and he has a good 

801
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,730
way of calming people down and relax and
people,

802
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:52,000
but he's very sensible,
like very normal and he was a cop.

803
00:39:52,001 --> 00:39:53,800
His whole life is caught for many,
many years.

804
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,960
It's just a fucking impossible job.
Ben.

805
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,760
Every day you're dealing with crime.
Every day you're dealing with murder.

806
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,440
You dealing with people,
beating their wives,

807
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,720
you're dealing with kids that get hit by
cars.

808
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,390
You're dealing with just the most 
horrible shit.

809
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,560
And we could boil this down to too many 
people because I live in a town where I 

810
00:40:13,021 --> 00:40:18,021
know the cops,
same cop came to to super bowl parties 

811
00:40:18,021 --> 00:40:22,730
in consecutive years.
The night before when we had a big pre 

812
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:26,550
party on the Saturday night and came for
noise complaints two years in a row,

813
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:31,910
the first time he walked in,
Christine Levine was on stage doing her 

814
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:35,671
act and you can hear everything in my 
neighborhood just speaking and when 

815
00:40:35,671 --> 00:40:39,270
she's on a microphone doing a bit about 
my after three kids,

816
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:44,690
my pussy looks like it.
It swallowed a dog that chewed its way 

817
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:48,921
out.
And I know every fucking neighbor is at 

818
00:40:49,021 --> 00:40:53,460
least 30 houses that can hear this over 
their TV.

819
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:55,350
That's hilarious.
And the cops came.

820
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,380
But that cop came twice and then I'd see
them at Safeway and weed friendly and 

821
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,210
when Bingo.
And I had our brief,

822
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:08,250
a breakup at cop came to my house.
I'm sitting in the fun house and I see a

823
00:41:08,251 --> 00:41:09,540
cop walking and I'm like,
oh,

824
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:12,630
that's fucking Yannis officer Bob 
friendly.

825
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:13,860
And he came in.
He goes,

826
00:41:13,861 --> 00:41:14,640
Hey,
uh,

827
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,500
I don't know.
It's none of my business,

828
00:41:16,501 --> 00:41:21,501
but I,
I heard you going through a tough time 

829
00:41:21,501 --> 00:41:21,501
and I just wanted to see if you're okay.
I'm like,

830
00:41:21,501 --> 00:41:23,220
that is fucking cool.
And now he,

831
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,020
he comes over all the time and.

832
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,740
Wow.
Yeah,

833
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,700
that is.
Yeah,

834
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:31,570
that's the benefit of the 5,000
person town when you know everybody.

835
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,040
Yeah.
There's stuff that's not a homeless

836
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,490
guy that's broken.
We have,

837
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,740
but everyone knows our homeless will 
work for food guy by name.

838
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,800
Do you think that you appreciate that 
more because you travel so much because 

839
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,840
you get to go back to that and this is 
home and home is this quiet,

840
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:52,760
cool place filled with artists and 
farmers and just Weirdos and shit.

841
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,610
But you're always like,
now you're in Dublin,

842
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,520
now you're in London,
now you're in San Francisco,

843
00:41:58,521 --> 00:41:59,800
now you're in.
You know,

844
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:04,310
you're always moving around so much that
you get a beautiful taste of everything.

845
00:42:04,311 --> 00:42:08,030
And then this is the also I,
I rarely go out.

846
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:11,930
I go to Safeway every day if I don't,
even if I don't need anything,

847
00:42:11,931 --> 00:42:15,860
it's my thing.
I wake up and I go to Safeway and I find

848
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,690
blood.
What's,

849
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,230
what's good?
Discount meat.

850
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,860
I love a bargain and the discount meats 
and other than that,

851
00:42:21,861 --> 00:42:23,450
I don't go out,
don't go to bars.

852
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:26,210
I have a bar in my house,
people I know,

853
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:28,490
they come over to my house and we hang 
out there.

854
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,360
Yeah,
no,

855
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,950
you've got an interesting setup,
man.

856
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,870
Whenever I listened to your podcast,
I'm like,

857
00:42:32,871 --> 00:42:37,871
this is such a fascinating setup,
but it's the same as the comedy store,

858
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:43,391
which when I come back I love it and I 
see a thousand people all in one night 

859
00:42:43,671 --> 00:42:47,990
that I've known you over the years,
but I don't hate anyone.

860
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:50,000
Right.
Where were you hear all the,

861
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,480
uh,
that fucking I hate that fucking cunt.

862
00:42:52,481 --> 00:42:54,870
She thinks she's funny and she's not 
funny.

863
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,330
And like I would be if I lived there,
if I was a regular,

864
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,670
like everyone else at the comedy store.
Yeah.

865
00:43:01,671 --> 00:43:03,950
Then I'd have my beefs and I'd be 
political.

866
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,350
Very few beefs there these days that 
interesting.

867
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,440
But I'm just saying like snipey,
backtalk talk shit behind your back 

868
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:11,450
thing.

869
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:16,430
I get into that again now I'm really 
happy to see everyone.

870
00:43:16,431 --> 00:43:19,190
I don't care if they suck.
I don't watch their acts anyway,

871
00:43:19,191 --> 00:43:23,510
but that's what business is like and I 
keep it that way where I don't go out.

872
00:43:23,511 --> 00:43:28,511
I don't get involved in their fucking 
petty squabbles and everyone's 

873
00:43:28,511 --> 00:43:32,090
backstabbing shit cause even when I am 
there for a long time,

874
00:43:32,091 --> 00:43:34,220
I don't leave the house.
I don't go out.

875
00:43:34,221 --> 00:43:36,460
I don't know.
Yeah.

876
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:41,470
So I don't have to take sides.
I'm a very fucking knew saying about 

877
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:44,090
avoiding conflict,
but honestly the comedy store these days

878
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:46,130
is,
is almost conflict free.

879
00:43:46,131 --> 00:43:48,290
It's weird.
It's so much weirder than it's ever been

880
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:50,780
there before.
It's like this super,

881
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,200
super supportive community.
It's very different.

882
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:56,640
I,
I'll just say comedy in general.

883
00:43:56,641 --> 00:43:58,220
What was La?
Well,

884
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:03,040
anywhere near headline in that place and
they won't give me this.

885
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:05,630
I don't have to deal with that,
but yeah,

886
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:09,500
and that's how I.
I keep busy where I go out rarely.

887
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:14,000
A lot of people don't believe I lived 
there.

888
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:18,440
I just have a house there that I show up
to.

889
00:44:18,441 --> 00:44:20,210
I'd say I live in,
but it would be funny.

890
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:25,370
Would it be funny if you only dressed 
like this on the show and then you 

891
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:25,700
immediately,
the show's over.

892
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:30,730
Oh,
I can't wait to get dressed for my golf 

893
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:32,681
tee off and an hour.
And then you put on like a polo shirt 

894
00:44:32,681 --> 00:44:32,681
and a fat rolex.

895
00:44:32,681 --> 00:44:36,330
I only have particular suits and 
pajamas.

896
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,290
That's it.
That's it.

897
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:39,840
I don't have you become ridiculous suit 
guy.

898
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:42,480
Like what year did you just give in to 
the ridiculous suit?

899
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:44,670
Uh,
when I got my first,

900
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,570
like really good.
When the one I wore a,

901
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,290
I forget what special it was.
I gotta like I've,

902
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:53,640
I've done this occasionally throughout 
the years and I used to wear a Santa hat

903
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:55,740
for a while and then,
uh,

904
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:00,860
but yeah,
and then we dress up and just fucking 

905
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:03,040
dumb shit sometimes just because I was 
bored like Muslim prayer robes on stage.

906
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:06,590
Where were you getting these ridiculous.
I got this.

907
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:11,840
My neighbor Evelyn found this great old 
plaid vintage 70 sport coat and I just 

908
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:18,420
happened to find a pair of yellow pants 
that matched it perfectly.

909
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,920
So then I'd start like really looking 
for when I could put a whole suit 

910
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,290
together and I'm like,
all right,

911
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,030
and then I realized white shoes go and 
everything's white loafers.

912
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:31,940
So then I just,
every,

913
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,920
that's all we do when we're driving on 
the road.

914
00:45:34,921 --> 00:45:39,921
The only interest I have are we hit all 
the thrift stores in the town and uh,

915
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,520
try to find good Sushi and that's it.
I'll go to a fucking museum.

916
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:48,310
So you look for wacky clothes to try on.
Yeah.

917
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,120
You,
you don't know.

918
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:54,160
Now I have a closet that like,
that's why I do these Ebay yard sales 

919
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,341
every couple years and I sell all the 
suits I'm tired of because my closet is 

920
00:45:58,341 --> 00:45:59,280
fucking buckling.
Wow.

921
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:05,270
What a weird thing to collect.
Get on the mailing list and other like 

922
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,720
you've been doing this as long as I can 
get a cool poster,

923
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:12,780
like a tour poster and you go,
Whoa,

924
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:16,080
I like that.
But as the years go on,

925
00:46:16,081 --> 00:46:19,180
you just build up clutter in your 
crawlspace and yeah,

926
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,710
you can only have so many pictures of 
yourself around fans.

927
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:25,980
They'll send me artwork like yo 
portrait.

928
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:28,010
They did of me and I'm like,
what?

929
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:33,050
I'm going to put up more pictures of me 
in my house and he comes over and it's 

930
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:37,110
just some fucking museum of you.
That's why you got to buy the house near

931
00:46:37,111 --> 00:46:42,111
the landing strip.
Just turned into the Doug Stan hope 

932
00:46:42,111 --> 00:46:42,111
resort.
Well,

933
00:46:42,111 --> 00:46:43,660
I sell the shit.
We do e Bay yard sales and yeah,

934
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,140
a fan would like that.
Their house.

935
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:49,680
I don't need a picture of me.
You'd like a tour poster?

936
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,750
That's a good move.
So yeah,

937
00:46:51,751 --> 00:46:56,751
get on the mailing list that Doug 
Stanhope Dot com because we're doing 

938
00:46:56,751 --> 00:46:59,481
another one in August.
So what do you do them personally like 

939
00:46:59,481 --> 00:47:00,270
to you out?
They're auctioning stuff off.

940
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:05,470
No,
it was just put it all on Ebay Stanhope 

941
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:06,270
Ebay Yard Sale.
And people bid on stuff.

942
00:47:06,271 --> 00:47:07,860
And a nice.

943
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:11,010
Yeah.
And it's it.

944
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:14,700
You don't want to throw this stuff away.
You can't give it to the thrift store.

945
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:19,820
No one wants it there.
So you're wearing a bunch of different 

946
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:19,890
people's clothes that have lived 
different,

947
00:47:19,891 --> 00:47:21,990
weird lives.
You know,

948
00:47:21,991 --> 00:47:26,991
think about how many,
like the kind of clothes that you're 

949
00:47:26,991 --> 00:47:26,991
buying,
you're buying like guys who were getting

950
00:47:26,991 --> 00:47:28,830
pussy in the seventies,
you know,

951
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:33,860
like that's the kind of clothes I used 
to do a bit about that and I don't know 

952
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,040
if I ever recorded that,
but about how you,

953
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:38,290
the in the polyester under hot lights,
he,

954
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:41,590
you,
you can only imagine how bad fucking had

955
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:46,591
to smell in the seventies.
Someone was dancing all night at the 

956
00:47:46,591 --> 00:47:50,540
studio,
54 and oh know doing blow and then 

957
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:53,560
sweating and then fucking in a bathroom 
with all their pubes on and

958
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,840
yeah.
And no deodorant.

959
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:58,090
What was deodorant like back then?
It was terrible.

960
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,280
Right?
Guard Aerosol.

961
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:05,340
That's what I grew up with.
Remember when everybody thought there 

962
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:05,690
was gonna be a giant hole in the ozone 
layer from the hairspray.

963
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:11,160
Hairspray's going to put a hole in the 
ozone layer and like apparently there's 

964
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:11,560
a big hole above Australia.
Australia has it bad.

965
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:15,600
Like there's all those skin cancer and 
do different.

966
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,710
Right.
Very rapidly in Australia.

967
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:23,100
Yeah.
I think there's a hole over there if 

968
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,940
they ever really remember that was the,
that there it is right over Australia.

969
00:48:24,941 --> 00:48:29,350
There's a God damn hole,
the image of the largest Antarctic ozone

970
00:48:29,351 --> 00:48:34,150
hole ever recorded over the South Pole,
September 2006 layers of the atmosphere.

971
00:48:34,151 --> 00:48:39,151
Not to scale.
The ozone layer is mainly found in the 

972
00:48:39,151 --> 00:48:42,331
lower portion of the stratosphere from 
approximately 20 to 30 kilometers ozone 

973
00:48:42,331 --> 00:48:43,420
depletion.
So there's a whole.

974
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:44,680
Yeah.
And if,

975
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:46,600
if the whole world was underneath that 
whole,

976
00:48:46,601 --> 00:48:50,530
we'd have some fucking real problems.
You play Australia?

977
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:51,760
Yeah,
we have been.

978
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:56,790
I haven't been in awhile though.
Last time I did a Melbourne had a great 

979
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:58,510
time or how do they make you say it?
Melvin Melvin.

980
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:01,870
I like Sydney.
Done Sydney there too.

981
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:04,450
They're nice.
People are fantastic.

982
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:04,780
Yeah.

983
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,370
Yeah.
That's my favorite.

984
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,280
And I did a Hobart Tasmania,
which is weird.

985
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,740
Wow.
Tasmania.

986
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,140
I read that.
I,

987
00:49:14,141 --> 00:49:19,141
I just,
I did a couple of weeks there in April 

988
00:49:19,141 --> 00:49:21,770
and uh,
I've read it's called the uh,

989
00:49:21,771 --> 00:49:26,771
the fatal shore and it's like this 700 
page history of Australia and it's 

990
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:30,680
fucking brutal.
Oh,

991
00:49:30,681 --> 00:49:33,320
it's crazy.
It's absolutely brutal,

992
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,440
or from the time they started shipping 
prisoners there for nothing,

993
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:44,360
their shackles and dying,
pestilence.

994
00:49:44,361 --> 00:49:45,020
They're in,
you know,

995
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:50,170
in halls,
they sit in boats for months waiting to 

996
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:53,570
be shipped to a camp.
It's just brutal after brutal.

997
00:49:53,571 --> 00:49:56,870
And then a flogging until the skin fell 
off his back.

998
00:49:56,871 --> 00:49:58,480
And then,
uh,

999
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:02,000
and then you do an interview where 
they're going,

1000
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:07,150
oh,
people need comedy in these times 

1001
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:07,150
because there are worse than ever.
I go,

1002
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:10,751
have you read your fucking history?
Trump is not the fucking worst thing 

1003
00:50:10,751 --> 00:50:14,740
ever.
When you look at your own fucking 

1004
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:14,740
history.
They did some dark shit

1005
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,440
to the aborigines too.
Oh yeah.

1006
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:22,130
One of the things they did,
they took a aborigine kids away from 

1007
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:23,880
their parents and they tried to raise 
him with a white families.

1008
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:29,180
They didn't like the 19 fifties I think.
And they were telling me it when I was 

1009
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:32,591
there and I was,
it was one of them jaw dropper 

1010
00:50:32,591 --> 00:50:32,591
conversations where people were talking 
like,

1011
00:50:32,591 --> 00:50:37,380
why?
Like they stole people's babies and 

1012
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,751
raise them as white kids.
Like because they didn't think the 

1013
00:50:40,751 --> 00:50:41,270
aborigines knew what they were doing.
So they just said,

1014
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,950
you don't know how to raise that kid.
Me that kid.

1015
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:46,430
It's Kinda like the foster system will 
know because they took them.

1016
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:51,820
It's not like the foster system.
The idea would be that someone would 

1017
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:53,690
either have to go to jail or someone who
would be murdered,

1018
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,910
heard or something.
You don't have.

1019
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:56,790
You're an unfit parent.

1020
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,580
That's sometimes.
Right.

1021
00:50:58,581 --> 00:50:59,750
I guess that does happen,
right?

1022
00:50:59,751 --> 00:51:04,751
If someone's a drug addict or a criminal
that they'll take your kid away and put 

1023
00:51:04,751 --> 00:51:08,021
it in foster care.
But this is just taking your kid away 

1024
00:51:08,021 --> 00:51:08,021
because you're an aborigine.

1025
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:13,060
Which if,
if their society thinks that's a bad 

1026
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:13,640
way,
what's wrong with a drug addict?

1027
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:16,970
I know drug addicts do a lot of stuff 
functionally.

1028
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,820
Yeah.
It is.

1029
00:51:18,821 --> 00:51:23,821
Levels to that is levels of drug addict.
You know what's weird about the 

1030
00:51:23,821 --> 00:51:24,760
aborigines?
They have hundreds of languages.

1031
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:25,490
They,
uh,

1032
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:27,080
they speak different language.
You'll,

1033
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,110
you'll be in a,
what they call a mob.

1034
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:33,640
They call themselves mom's like a tribe.
It's a mob and you'll have a mob,

1035
00:51:33,641 --> 00:51:37,450
but there'll be another mob that's 30 
kilometers away and they speak a totally

1036
00:51:37,451 --> 00:51:42,451
different language.
You don't know what the fuck they're 

1037
00:51:42,451 --> 00:51:44,221
saying and then there's another one over
there and most of it's not even written 

1038
00:51:44,221 --> 00:51:46,330
down and there's hundreds and hundreds 
of them and they're all over the.

1039
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:47,200
I mean,
it's a,

1040
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:50,830
it's an amazing,
strange culture.

1041
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:53,110
Like the culture of the aborigines in 
Australia.

1042
00:51:53,111 --> 00:51:54,790
My friend Adam,
Adam Green tree,

1043
00:51:55,510 --> 00:52:00,510
he uh,
he runs a mining company in Australia 

1044
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:03,370
and he works with a lot of the 
aboriginal people that get some jobs and

1045
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,940
gets to understand their culture and 
talk to them.

1046
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:10,980
He's told me some just insane shit about
how these people have lived and they'd 

1047
00:52:11,291 --> 00:52:12,570
been there forever.
You know,

1048
00:52:12,571 --> 00:52:16,060
they've been there for a long time.
All living in these little tribes,

1049
00:52:16,061 --> 00:52:16,990
these little moms.

1050
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:19,230
It's crazy.
Yeah.

1051
00:52:19,231 --> 00:52:22,830
They would have no structures.
When they first showed up over there,

1052
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:28,070
the aborigines were basically packs and 
they basically cut and burn or you know,

1053
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:34,790
they hunt as much as they could in an 
area and they didn't have houses.

1054
00:52:35,521 --> 00:52:38,250
They had no,
like to just move on.

1055
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:39,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

1056
00:52:39,831 --> 00:52:42,200
And they were living,
you know,

1057
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:47,590
like essentially like how native 
Americans were maybe in the 14,

1058
00:52:47,871 --> 00:52:51,560
hundreds of 15 centers,
probably even more simply.

1059
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:53,420
Right.
I mean,

1060
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:57,150
I wonder,
it was just there.

1061
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:00,410
Well that's why they wouldn't fuck with 
New Zealand because the,

1062
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,570
the Mowery,
however you pronounce that,

1063
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:07,810
the Maori people would,
they were fucking bad asses and they 

1064
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:08,000
were somewhat fortified.
I,

1065
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,310
I,
I've retained so little.

1066
00:53:10,311 --> 00:53:15,311
I read the book and I have two days 
later I have like three facts that I'd 

1067
00:53:15,891 --> 00:53:17,900
probably have two of them wrong,
but yeah,

1068
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,460
they weren't terrified of the fucking.

1069
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,980
Everybody's scared of the mowery's.
Everybody's scared of just New Zealand.

1070
00:53:22,981 --> 00:53:25,020
People are very fierce.
Fierce.

1071
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,400
It's just,
it's crazy to think that those two 

1072
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,181
places,
particular Australia was a prison 

1073
00:53:35,181 --> 00:53:36,600
colony,
essentially free for England.

1074
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:37,500
I mean,
that's,

1075
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,080
that's how they treated it.
It was,

1076
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,740
it was fucking slavery is what it was.
It was white slavery because they there.

1077
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:48,810
The whole idea was to make these 
prisoners build this into a country.

1078
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:55,850
Meanwhile,
the crazy thing is the weather's way 

1079
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:58,461
better than anyone I know.
Only fucking England would use the 

1080
00:53:58,461 --> 00:54:02,031
beautiful place as a fucking penal 
colony and can't wait to get back to 

1081
00:54:03,061 --> 00:54:08,061
fucking shop.
Share him by the sea where it's fucking 

1082
00:54:08,061 --> 00:54:10,380
48 degrees and gloomy and shitty,
gloomy,

1083
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:13,400
and everybody's just sour and dour.
Meanwhile,

1084
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:17,160
you're in the Gold Coast,
Australia jumping into the water,

1085
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:20,400
having a Martini on the beach.
The weather's perfect.

1086
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:23,080
Yeah,
but same token.

1087
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:28,100
Back then there was no fucking plumbing 
and it was hard to find clean water to 

1088
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,850
drink and that's true.

1089
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,520
Everything that'll kill you and 
everything kills you,

1090
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:35,670
including jellyfish.
That's what's the most fucked up.

1091
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,680
God Damn Jelly Fish Kill you,
sally.

1092
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:39,480
Fish,
salt,

1093
00:54:39,481 --> 00:54:40,630
water,
crocodiles,

1094
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,770
wherever.
They just captured one in Australia that

1095
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:47,970
for forever 15 feet long,
1300 cell phones.

1096
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:52,680
They're always catching sharks.
Sharks all over the place.

1097
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:55,470
The outside waters just surrounded with 
great whites.

1098
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:58,110
Oh No.
Sharks.

1099
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:00,420
Saltwater kill Ya.
Spiders,

1100
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,700
snakes,
all these different things,

1101
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,050
but the people are cool as fuck that.
Like some of most famous too though.

1102
00:55:07,051 --> 00:55:08,160
Look at that.
Like I really.

1103
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:09,540
Yeah,
I would say,

1104
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:14,630
yeah,
you have a bunch of fucking racist and 

1105
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:14,630
the cheer.
Whoa,

1106
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:16,860
whoa.
Look at the size of that crocodile,

1107
00:55:16,861 --> 00:55:21,861
the captured why in the fuck man,
it's 60 years old to how many people 

1108
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:28,790
have that thing eaten,
that things eating at least tie their 

1109
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:29,250
shoes in that belly.
Oh yeah.

1110
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:32,070
Oh,
a friend of mine,

1111
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,800
a film this show,
it's called uncharted.

1112
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:36,360
And uh,
his name is Jim.

1113
00:55:36,361 --> 00:55:41,361
Shocking.
This is a professional hunter from 

1114
00:55:41,361 --> 00:55:43,911
Canada.
They hired him to go to Africa to shoot 

1115
00:55:43,911 --> 00:55:46,431
these crocodiles that were killing all 
these people that lived in this village 

1116
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:49,940
while they were there.
Someone got snatched and taken by a 

1117
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:50,210
crocodile and like,
so you're,

1118
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:55,220
you're seeing everyone in the village is
missing an arm or they have a chunk 

1119
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,250
taken out of their hat or a chunk taken 
out of their thigh.

1120
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:02,080
Like this is nuts.
Like these people are always in fear of 

1121
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:06,201
getting eaten everywhere they go.
They're free of getting eaten by these 

1122
00:56:06,201 --> 00:56:07,560
enormous Nile crocodiles,
you know,

1123
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:09,060
13,
14 feet long.

1124
00:56:09,061 --> 00:56:11,370
Just grabbing people and pulling them 
under water.

1125
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,020
I really want to go to the outback.
They have a train,

1126
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:21,400
you have to train.
So one's called the Gan that goes from 

1127
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,220
Adelaide all the way up to Darwin and 
they have another that goes

1128
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:29,220
all the way from Perth to Sydney and I 
really want to just do a train trip 

1129
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:33,640
because in the middle there's like a 
cooper pd is a mining town where most of

1130
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:35,980
the town is underground because it gets 
that hot.

1131
00:56:35,981 --> 00:56:39,790
It's 120 degrees.
So they built the town underground.

1132
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,330
Jesus.
Yeah.

1133
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,180
I,
I want to go see some weird shit.

1134
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,260
Sydney is fucking Vancouver,
right,

1135
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:47,170
right,
right,

1136
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:49,120
right.
It's not the weird shit.

1137
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:49,820
And you could

1138
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,880
drive for hours and hours and not see 
nothing.

1139
00:56:52,881 --> 00:56:54,950
In Australia,
a lot of these guys,

1140
00:56:54,951 --> 00:56:59,690
they get those snorkels on their cars 
and it's not for going under water.

1141
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,120
It's just because the amount of dirt you
have to drive through.

1142
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,010
Oh you want to have.
Yeah.

1143
00:57:04,011 --> 00:57:09,011
You want to have a.
You want to have a snorkel like high 

1144
00:57:09,011 --> 00:57:10,520
above your car so that you're getting 
cleaner air.

1145
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:15,560
Now they all have extended gas tanks to 
get these giant gas tanks put on because

1146
00:57:15,561 --> 00:57:17,360
they know they're going to be driving 
for 15,

1147
00:57:17,361 --> 00:57:21,050
16 hours without seeing a gas station.
Fuck man.

1148
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,210
That's why I thought the train.
Yeah.

1149
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,730
No,
it's a weird place,

1150
00:57:25,731 --> 00:57:30,731
man.
Australia is one of the last weird 

1151
00:57:30,731 --> 00:57:33,341
places.
There's 20 million people in the entire 

1152
00:57:33,341 --> 00:57:35,900
country and it's the same size as the 
contiguous United States of dirt.

1153
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:39,700
It's all dirt and there's only 20 
million people less than live in la.

1154
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,560
Live in this one.
Huge country.

1155
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,740
I love it.
It's like a small town but a country you

1156
00:57:46,741 --> 00:57:48,530
know,
like the same proportions

1157
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:53,930
and it's all Darwin is the only one I 
want to go to that's north and really 

1158
00:57:54,001 --> 00:57:56,310
tropical or do you want to go to that 
one?

1159
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:59,430
It just sounds like a weird place to go

1160
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:04,540
that it's sloppy goes.
That's where Darwin did all of his 

1161
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:04,820
research,
the Galapagos Islands,

1162
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:08,750
some of his research compiling his 
theories on evolution,

1163
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:12,530
but it's apparently some crazy tropical 
island that's.

1164
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,760
They're trying so hard to keep it from 
being touched and influenced by people,

1165
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:19,640
but every time people go over there,
you have to clean off their shoes.

1166
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,320
Yeah.
It's like,

1167
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:20,900
uh,
the,

1168
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:23,130
the,
the don't step off the track,

1169
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:26,590
but what's the fucking go back in time?
The Butterfly Effect.

1170
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:27,410
Yeah,
yeah,

1171
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:28,510
yeah,
yeah,

1172
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,160
yeah,
yeah.

1173
00:58:30,161 --> 00:58:32,440
People are uh,
I mean everywhere,

1174
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:37,650
but that's,
isn't that how life got spread all 

1175
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:37,650
across the world.
I mean,

1176
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:39,280
I know we shouldn't do it on purpose and
foolishly,

1177
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:43,600
but I mean a lot of how life got spread 
is just things,

1178
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:48,630
picking things up and carrying them in 
their shit and dropping them off there 

1179
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:49,200
and this germs and steel.
Yeah.

1180
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:52,000
I mean that's really how everything gets
spread.

1181
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:56,110
We're just doing it on a larger scale 
because we use planes and boats and like

1182
00:58:56,111 --> 00:59:01,111
Hawaii,
everything on Hawaii is something 

1183
00:59:01,111 --> 00:59:03,631
somebody brought over everything.
Like there's some birds that used to 

1184
00:59:03,631 --> 00:59:04,570
live there and some bugs,
you know,

1185
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:06,970
and everything else is all the different
wildlife,

1186
00:59:06,971 --> 00:59:09,100
all the animals.
So just been brought over there.

1187
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:12,880
The other worst than going to Hawaii 
here in white people,

1188
00:59:12,881 --> 00:59:14,470
Bitch.
About the tourists,

1189
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:16,570
white people that live there.
Yeah.

1190
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,460
Oh yeah.
That's funny.

1191
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:22,620
And how tourism is destroying ecosystem.

1192
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:23,960
Elon,
who the fuck are you?

1193
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:31,120
That's silly.
And what would you do without the 

1194
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:31,120
tourists?
Yeah,

1195
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:31,120
you should.
Uh,

1196
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:35,660
Roseanne's going to actually fucking 
make money off a macadamia nut farm.

1197
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,420
I think she's going to be out selling 
fucking nuts somewhere.

1198
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,460
Oh,
she never had.

1199
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,860
She never,
she,

1200
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,650
I think I told you,
she called me again.

1201
00:59:45,651 --> 00:59:47,630
It goes,
I'm ready to do Rogan.

1202
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:52,610
We've been going back and forth now she 
says she's gonna do her own podcast.

1203
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:54,800
We're going to do it.
It's just gonna take time.

1204
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,630
You know,
I told this is what I told her.

1205
00:59:56,870 --> 01:00:00,530
She said she contacted me the day says 
I'm ready to do it whenever you are.

1206
01:00:00,531 --> 01:00:02,960
I said,
you just tell me when and we'll do it.

1207
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,570
And then we're trying to figure out I'm 
in Salt Lake City.

1208
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:09,470
I'm on either other sounds.
There was a little bit of that and then,

1209
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:14,530
you know,
she's just trying to figure out when's 

1210
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:14,530
the right time.

1211
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:14,650
But she said she wants to do her own 
youtube channel and she's,

1212
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,900
she's upset at everybody and,
and I felt like,

1213
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:20,150
you know,
she's,

1214
01:00:20,151 --> 01:00:21,920
there's a lot of merit and what she's 
saying,

1215
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:24,230
you know,
I really do think she got fucked over.

1216
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:25,160
I think,
uh,

1217
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:30,550
I really do think she made a joke about 
a woman that she didn't know was black 

1218
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:33,080
and a woman who's.
I think she's the only one eighth.

1219
01:00:33,081 --> 01:00:34,190
Black,
right.

1220
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:36,140
Is that what you.
I saw the picture and I like,

1221
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:36,920
oh,
I get it.

1222
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:40,550
She talked to her on the phone 
afterwards where she goes,

1223
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,120
she was asking me for advice and she,
that I,

1224
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:48,020
I really fucked up and I honestly didn't
think she was black.

1225
01:00:48,021 --> 01:00:51,140
And then she goes,
did you ever do ambien?

1226
01:00:51,141 --> 01:00:56,141
I go,
that's exactly why I stopped doing 

1227
01:00:56,141 --> 01:00:58,541
ambien.
And I'm sure that's why she tweeted that

1228
01:00:58,881 --> 01:01:03,881
where I like,
just talk about this on Rogan because 

1229
01:01:03,881 --> 01:01:03,881
Rogan spends time.

1230
01:01:03,881 --> 01:01:06,320
You can explain stuff.
Stop fucking tweeting.

1231
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,510
Tweet where she goes.
I did take an ambient.

1232
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:12,680
Yeah,
you drink on Ambien and your fuck.

1233
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:17,420
I can tell you a million stories of 
normal people like fucking,

1234
01:01:17,421 --> 01:01:18,680
you know,
Judy Brown,

1235
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,910
her husband,
Steve Marmel almost had a plane grounded

1236
01:01:22,911 --> 01:01:27,911
because he on a flight,
he took an Ambien and had a couple of 

1237
01:01:27,911 --> 01:01:32,081
bourbons and then just started going 
fucking batshit has no recollection of 

1238
01:01:32,081 --> 01:01:36,731
it and I've done stuff that was minor 
where I just had a very lucid business 

1239
01:01:37,281 --> 01:01:42,281
conversation with Hannigan after I'd 
taken an ambient on like a light night 

1240
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:47,141
of drinking for me,
which six or seven beers and I went to 

1241
01:01:47,141 --> 01:01:48,980
bed and then I get,
get up 15 minutes later and went out and

1242
01:01:48,981 --> 01:01:53,981
had this very lucid business 
conversation that I don't remember it 

1243
01:01:53,981 --> 01:01:55,580
all and I brought it up to him the next 
day.

1244
01:01:55,581 --> 01:01:57,050
Something we were going to talk about.

1245
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:59,450
He goes,
we talked about this last night.

1246
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:00,110
No,
no.

1247
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:02,690
Was,
I guess you came out?

1248
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:03,230
I go,
no,

1249
01:02:03,231 --> 01:02:04,640
I went to bed.
Because guess what,

1250
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:09,660
you came out shortly afterward.
You seem to very like completely normal.

1251
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,960
Wow.
Kevin James,

1252
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:13,370
uh,
uh,

1253
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,670
he made dinner.
He uh,

1254
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:18,440
went downstairs,
made his own dinner,

1255
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:20,620
cooked it,
aided,

1256
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,790
went back to bed,
got up in the morning and was like,

1257
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:26,340
who the fuck cooked?
And then they're there like you did.

1258
01:02:26,341 --> 01:02:26,730
He's like,
no,

1259
01:02:26,731 --> 01:02:27,600
I didn't.
He goes,

1260
01:02:27,601 --> 01:02:27,840
like,
no.

1261
01:02:27,841 --> 01:02:28,500
Yeah,
you did.

1262
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,930
Look here,
you throw this away like you cook this,

1263
01:02:30,931 --> 01:02:34,780
like what the fuck your brother?
You remember my ex renee,

1264
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:38,610
her brother and his buddy took some 
ambience,

1265
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:43,670
had minor amounts of cocktails,
woke up on a lawn in a neighborhood they

1266
01:02:44,191 --> 01:02:48,570
didn't know where they were cheeses and 
that's where it was.

1267
01:02:48,571 --> 01:02:51,810
That one lucid business conversation 
where you go,

1268
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:57,050
that could have been me driving my car 
into someone's front fucking porch.

1269
01:02:58,260 --> 01:02:59,120
So yeah,
I,

1270
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,960
I,
I swore it off.

1271
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,990
My Mom said that she took it and uh,
no booze,

1272
01:03:03,991 --> 01:03:08,580
just took the ambient and wound up a 
drawing on a bathroom.

1273
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:09,960
Carpet,
you know,

1274
01:03:09,961 --> 01:03:13,480
in the little bathroom rugs,
just drawing on with like lipstick and,

1275
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:16,890
and nail pause doesn't have any 
recollection of doing it.

1276
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:19,800
Just drawing on it like a little kid 
would where they pulled the nail Polish.

1277
01:03:19,801 --> 01:03:20,250
Just start.

1278
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:24,480
It's a weird thing.
It's called a hypnotic,

1279
01:03:24,481 --> 01:03:27,900
that's what they called that,
that category of drugs.

1280
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:32,070
The other thing with Roseanne is like 
she,

1281
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:37,130
well,
she's got serious mental illness and 

1282
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:37,860
she's on a bunch of different 
medications as well.

1283
01:03:37,861 --> 01:03:40,200
She's got legit multiple personality 
disorder.

1284
01:03:40,201 --> 01:03:45,201
She's talked about it and I don't think 
they call it multiple personality 

1285
01:03:45,201 --> 01:03:45,510
disorder anymore.
I think they have a new name for it,

1286
01:03:45,511 --> 01:03:50,100
but since the noise rebranding fucking 
mental illnesses,

1287
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:51,150
like,
come on man.

1288
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:54,870
It's like this is what it is.
It is multiple personality disorder.

1289
01:03:54,871 --> 01:03:57,930
She has a bunch of different people and 
you know,

1290
01:03:57,931 --> 01:04:02,931
if you talked to people that had been 
around her and see or switch from 

1291
01:04:02,931 --> 01:04:02,931
personality to personality,
you realize like,

1292
01:04:02,931 --> 01:04:03,990
oh,
and you know,

1293
01:04:03,991 --> 01:04:06,330
a lot of this also came from head 
trauma.

1294
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:11,660
She's one of several comedians that 
became a different person because of 

1295
01:04:11,851 --> 01:04:12,510
head trauma.

1296
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:15,330
I think she was hit by a car as well.
Sam Kennison,

1297
01:04:15,331 --> 01:04:20,331
same thing.
Hit by a car and also she was in a car 

1298
01:04:20,331 --> 01:04:21,180
accident.
I don't know if it was child molestation

1299
01:04:21,181 --> 01:04:25,740
or rape and disassociative identity 
disorder.

1300
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:30,741
That's what they're calling it now,
and she also can't fucking tell the 

1301
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:35,001
difference between twitter and a green 
room because if every single comic was 

1302
01:04:36,841 --> 01:04:40,710
recorded,
the dark shit that we say in green rooms

1303
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:43,860
because we're comics and we saved the 
worst possible thing,

1304
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:48,890
especially to make each other laugh 
because you go to the darkest areas and 

1305
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:53,121
you say all the wrong words and you say 
the most racist thing to your black 

1306
01:04:54,511 --> 01:04:59,511
comic friend and he says the fucking 
worst thing to you about your fucking 

1307
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:04,770
ugly fucking teeth,
or you're fat or you're fucking stupid,

1308
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:07,800
and if she walked into the green room 
and said that about that lady,

1309
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:09,270
we would be laughing.
Right.

1310
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:14,330
We'd be laughing,
especially if we know who she was and 

1311
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:16,260
then I didn't know Ashley was saying 
something racist.

1312
01:05:16,261 --> 01:05:17,380
You'd look at the picture,
go,

1313
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:17,980
don't

1314
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,470
get it.
I had no understanding of who that woman

1315
01:05:20,471 --> 01:05:25,471
was.
I never had heard of her before until 

1316
01:05:25,471 --> 01:05:25,950
Rosana got fired and I was like,
who is this lady in?

1317
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:28,330
She's saying she's the Muslim 
Brotherhood,

1318
01:05:28,331 --> 01:05:31,840
and then Rosanne said that she thought 
she was Jewish and I was like,

1319
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:34,570
okay,
if you think she was black,

1320
01:05:34,571 --> 01:05:36,910
I thought she was Jewish and I looked at
the picture.

1321
01:05:36,911 --> 01:05:38,160
I go,
alright,

1322
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:40,570
well yeah,
the fucking that's a,

1323
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:45,630
that's not a cut and dry one.
If you read two years of Roseanne's 

1324
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:50,371
tweets,
that would not be the one that stood 

1325
01:05:50,371 --> 01:05:52,360
out.
She just says fucking insane stuff.

1326
01:05:52,361 --> 01:05:56,470
That makes no sense all the time.
Did she say that Susan Rice,

1327
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:00,220
she said she was a great big,
uh,

1328
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,030
big ape with no a man.
Oh,

1329
01:06:04,031 --> 01:06:07,210
she's a man with giant swinging a balls.

1330
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:15,420
This was like five years ago,
and then five years later they give her 

1331
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:16,300
that Sitcom and can't believe she's 
acting crazy.

1332
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:23,730
I completely fault ABC.
Seen a fucking cash cow that.

1333
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:24,510
No,
they,

1334
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:26,950
they thought they could handle her.
Hey,

1335
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:30,760
we can make a lot of money by giving a 
toddler a pistol.

1336
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:36,090
Well,
you know what else she said she felt 

1337
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:36,090
like she promised not to.
What she felt.

1338
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:38,070
She felt like she was being removed from
the creative process to.

1339
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:43,230
Oh,
there was a bunch of things going on 

1340
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:43,480
even before this and that.
This was like one of the final steps,

1341
01:06:43,481 --> 01:06:48,481
but that they were.
She was having a hard time with the 

1342
01:06:48,481 --> 01:06:50,881
whole process and she was definitely 
having a hard time with being 

1343
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:50,881
overworked.
She's like,

1344
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:53,150
I am all about the Illuminati and Zion 
is.

1345
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:56,140
Maybe we should get you out of the 
writer's room.

1346
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:01,560
Will not.
Wouldn't be a bad idea to do an episode 

1347
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,140
about her thinking that everything is 
the Illuminati mean.

1348
01:07:02,141 --> 01:07:04,840
That's fucking gold comedy there.
There's so much there.

1349
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:10,080
I had explained to her chem trails like,
but the thing is be different than 

1350
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:13,180
anybody that I've ever talked to about 
these kind of wacky conspiracy theories.

1351
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:15,450
When I explained to her what,
what,

1352
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:17,710
how those clouds are made,
she went,

1353
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:18,610
oh,
okay.

1354
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,160
Just let it go.
Like most of them,

1355
01:07:21,161 --> 01:07:22,870
don't fucking let it go.
If you tell them that,

1356
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:23,950
well,
you see those planes,

1357
01:07:23,951 --> 01:07:25,290
they're spraying overhead and go,
no,

1358
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:25,500
no,
no.

1359
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:30,510
It's the heat of the engine,
the condensation and the atmosphere is 

1360
01:07:30,510 --> 01:07:33,451
actually creating a cloud.
It's just the water vapor and it mixes 

1361
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:34,870
with the heat of this engine.
It makes clouds.

1362
01:07:34,871 --> 01:07:36,850
It's all it is.
Rosanna just goes,

1363
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,560
okay.
Just let it go.

1364
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:40,810
Like everybody else is like bullshit,
man.

1365
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,000
There's fucking documents.
There's papers.

1366
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:48,090
The CIA's admitted it.
It's one of the hardest things in the 

1367
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:48,700
world when you get a stupid conspiracy 
theory in your head.

1368
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:51,070
It's one of the hardest things the world
is to just go.

1369
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:54,130
That might be bullshit.
It might be bullshit.

1370
01:07:54,131 --> 01:07:54,650
What's your,
uh,

1371
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:57,280
what's your latest favorite conspiracy 
theory?

1372
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:01,900
I've dropped off the map.
The favorite one that I believe in.

1373
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:04,750
Yeah.
Or Man,

1374
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:07,090
I don't have a good one that I believe 
in.

1375
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:10,020
Are there new ones that people are 
always.

1376
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:11,800
There's always new ones.
Everything.

1377
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:17,040
Everything's a goddamn conspiracy.
This is like constantly everything that 

1378
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,050
everybody does.
What's a good one?

1379
01:08:18,051 --> 01:08:20,540
Jamie?
What's a good recent conspiracy theory?

1380
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:23,750
The Russia stuff,
but I can't.

1381
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:27,260
I can't make heads or tails this Russia 
shit.

1382
01:08:27,261 --> 01:08:32,261
I.
Every time I read the Muir documents on 

1383
01:08:32,261 --> 01:08:33,650
the reading what's been reported and 
who's getting indicted and I'm like,

1384
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:34,000
this is.

1385
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:34,930
Yeah,
I,

1386
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,510
I.
This is too much zoomed out early.

1387
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:41,030
He just asked for a 100 blank 
indictments yesterday.

1388
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:42,790
Meal or did.
Yeah.

1389
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:45,740
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1390
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:47,360
100.
What?

1391
01:08:47,361 --> 01:08:49,490
Did they arrest trump?
Are they allowed to arrest him?

1392
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:52,400
That's part of what the whole thing with
the judge is going on right now.

1393
01:08:52,401 --> 01:08:56,840
The Dude Court judge will.
Somebody was explaining the relationship

1394
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:59,750
that the judge has.
The judge who stepped down has to.

1395
01:08:59,751 --> 01:09:04,070
Trump is his son is trump's banker from 
Deutsche Bank.

1396
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:04,690
Okay.

1397
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,340
Geez.

1398
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,600
Ooh,
that's too much space.

1399
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:17,880
Yeah.
Occasionally I'll look in.

1400
01:09:17,881 --> 01:09:18,930
Okay.
Have,

1401
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:24,020
you know trump and Kim Jong Il and 
Dennis Rodman or in together into visa.

1402
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:30,180
Poor.
This is the new.

1403
01:09:30,181 --> 01:09:35,181
Oh,
the newest one is the new fake Melania 

1404
01:09:35,181 --> 01:09:35,181
trump.
They think the new body double that.

1405
01:09:35,181 --> 01:09:36,750
Melania is not going on these trips 
anymore.

1406
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:41,070
I know that one of you called Alex Jones
who he would,

1407
01:09:41,071 --> 01:09:42,960
uh,
he'd yell at us about it.

1408
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:49,030
Is it true?
What does it say?

1409
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:49,910
Two hours ago.
This,

1410
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:51,130
this article up.
Okay.

1411
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:52,240
Erie.
New Pictures.

1412
01:09:52,241 --> 01:09:54,440
Melania trump.
Reignite conspiracy.

1413
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:57,040
Conspiracy theory.
She's using a body double.

1414
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:58,270
Okay.
What are the pictures?

1415
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:02,130
It's supposed to be her and 2017.
Okay.

1416
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:04,320
Uh,

1417
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,580
what website is this by the way?
I don't know.

1418
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:12,120
I don't know.
You're not even going to check.

1419
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:17,170
Click the first.
I just went to the first one that was 

1420
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:17,170
just posted that.
Well,

1421
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:20,051
what are the pictures down low.
That's when that it's supposed to look 

1422
01:10:20,051 --> 01:10:20,051
weird.
I think if you scroll lower.

1423
01:10:20,051 --> 01:10:24,740
Yeah.
I think we have an answer to why 

1424
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:26,840
millenium is missing so much lately.
Look closely.

1425
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:33,340
Yeah.
It doesn't look like her,

1426
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:41,760
but that's only in this.
I mean that does not look like Arab.

1427
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:46,930
Only in this presidency.
Would this be something that we would 

1428
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:48,740
think about only this is the like we're 
like,

1429
01:10:48,741 --> 01:10:50,030
man,
that ain't even his wife.

1430
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:55,210
These you've got your body double.
Like what are they going to do with 

1431
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:58,021
Melania leaves him.
He's going to get a double because you 

1432
01:10:58,021 --> 01:10:58,021
going to get a body double is just going
to give her money.

1433
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:03,120
It could just go hooked up with this 
chick on tinder.

1434
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:09,530
Like what's going to happen?
Like at what point are people going to 

1435
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:12,861
stop being completely be fuddled that he
said something and

1436
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:16,850
stormy Daniels got arrested yesterday.
That's,

1437
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:19,110
that's,
that's some bullshit.

1438
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:24,180
Sue's touching an undercover cop.
Was it she was touching on the cover 

1439
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:26,250
crop or she allow the undercover cop to 
touch her?

1440
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:32,230
I believe that,
but what I read from her attorney last 

1441
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:36,370
night on twitter is that she'd,
this is the same show or whatever 

1442
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:36,370
performance she's been doing all over 
the country.

1443
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:36,860
It's like,
it's what she does,

1444
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:39,920
that she was going to do it.
So it was almost a setup or something.

1445
01:11:40,490 --> 01:11:42,560
Yeah.
She wasn't blowing a guy in a fucking,

1446
01:11:42,561 --> 01:11:44,810
you know,
the champagne room or something.

1447
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:50,830
When you read the law it said the law 
was that you can't touch someone in an 

1448
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:56,540
adult establishment unless it's a family
member.

1449
01:11:57,110 --> 01:11:59,450
That's the fucking law.
Whoa.

1450
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:02,510
So you walked over to Jamie and rubbed 
his back.

1451
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:06,530
You'd go to jail.
Unless we're related.

1452
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:11,480
We haven't done a 23 employee who 
regularly appears nude or semi nude in a

1453
01:12:11,481 --> 01:12:16,481
sexually oriented business is prohibited
from touching patrons except for family 

1454
01:12:16,481 --> 01:12:16,481
members.
Huh?

1455
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:18,500
So,
uh,

1456
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:19,250
that's

1457
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:20,820
Smith.

1458
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,320
Oh,
there it goes.

1459
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:25,080
The charges were dismissed according to 
court documents,

1460
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:27,700
so it almost makes it more news that she
was arrested.

1461
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:33,220
I wonder if it was like a rogue cop 
who's like a fucking trump fan was like,

1462
01:12:33,221 --> 01:12:34,340
fuck dude.
Booch.

1463
01:12:34,610 --> 01:12:36,850
Absolutely do it for Donald.
Yeah.

1464
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:37,740
Yeah,
it can.

1465
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:40,240
Absolutely.
That's not a well thought.

1466
01:12:40,241 --> 01:12:45,241
Well oiled planned by the White House.
That's a plan by one fucking yahoo with 

1467
01:12:48,131 --> 01:12:51,130
uh,
with three different mega hats at home,

1468
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:52,360
you know,
on the foot.

1469
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:57,400
Fucking thorn in his shoe was bitch.
She thinks she's going to take down.

1470
01:12:57,430 --> 01:13:01,840
Potus is my favorite when they call him 
Potus,

1471
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:02,740
you know,
like they,

1472
01:13:02,741 --> 01:13:05,780
like with potus did this.
He does.

1473
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:07,600
It's trump.
It's trump.

1474
01:13:07,601 --> 01:13:08,560
We've got to stop.
Yeah.

1475
01:13:08,561 --> 01:13:09,080
That's,
uh,

1476
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:11,560
that's one syllable.
Not only that,

1477
01:13:11,561 --> 01:13:13,630
it's like this is what got us here in 
the first place.

1478
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,360
Daniel's removed.
What?

1479
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:21,570
Okay.
Then probation affidavit obtained by 

1480
01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:21,570
CNN,
uh,

1481
01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:25,171
detectives who were at the sirens.
Gentleman's club said they observed 

1482
01:13:25,171 --> 01:13:25,810
Daniel's.
Remove her top and force patrons.

1483
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:27,610
Face intern.
Chest force.

1484
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:29,140
Yeah.
While she's a monster.

1485
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:32,400
She wasn't here for this.
Yeah.

1486
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:37,440
It's not like she did that to a trained 
killer with a gun to a cop.

1487
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:42,580
It's not like even a regular guy.
It's a guy who makes his living stopping

1488
01:13:42,581 --> 01:13:46,120
crime and she stopped being fun Vice 
Cup,

1489
01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:49,990
but he can't even stop to plunge like 
he.

1490
01:13:49,991 --> 01:13:52,500
She forced him in there.
There was nothing he could do about it.

1491
01:13:52,501 --> 01:13:54,910
It was basically rape.
Nothing he could do.

1492
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:56,770
He couldn't go,
hey,

1493
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:59,200
stop another.
Me Too.

1494
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:01,870
When officers witnessed those 
activities,

1495
01:14:01,871 --> 01:14:06,871
three detective approach to stage 
Daniel's allegedly made her way towards 

1496
01:14:06,871 --> 01:14:08,320
the two.
Detectives leaned over and grabbed their

1497
01:14:08,321 --> 01:14:10,870
faces.
She shoved each of their faces,

1498
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:12,250
her breasts court

1499
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:14,290
documents said,
come on.

1500
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:17,780
They locked her up because the officer's
face with her breast,

1501
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:18,980
they,
they.

1502
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,600
I can't believe that she found a third 
officer,

1503
01:14:21,601 --> 01:14:25,930
his buttocks and breasts according to 
the document and then force the officers

1504
01:14:25,931 --> 01:14:29,530
had between her breasts and smack the 
officer's face with her breast.

1505
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:33,700
Imagine arresting somebody for that.
You fucking lazy.

1506
01:14:33,701 --> 01:14:38,420
Civil Servant Leach.
You Leach bleach.

1507
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:43,740
There's money that could have gone to 
schools as money could have gone to fix 

1508
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:47,281
streets.
Money could have gone to all sorts of 

1509
01:14:47,281 --> 01:14:47,281
good things in the community,
but you leached it.

1510
01:14:47,281 --> 01:14:52,111
You fucking snail just creeped over.
Get that lady to touch you and arrested 

1511
01:14:52,241 --> 01:14:53,650
her.
Well,

1512
01:14:53,651 --> 01:14:56,350
I did get $6,000
bail.

1513
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:58,020
Yeah,
but she's.

1514
01:14:58,030 --> 01:15:00,390
The charges have already dismissed.
Doesn't she get that money back?

1515
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:02,080
I think so,
yeah.

1516
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:04,360
It's a particular bus.
Fucking ridiculous.

1517
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:06,440
That's the thing that you're saying 
there,

1518
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:07,750
but this is cops.

1519
01:15:08,110 --> 01:15:13,110
Some of them are awesome.
Some of them are awesome and just get a 

1520
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:15,640
certain small percentage of them that 
ruined it for everybody.

1521
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:20,820
It doesn't even have to be one percent,
but one percent of cops out there 

1522
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:24,631
shooting kids.
I mean it's less than that because it's 

1523
01:15:24,631 --> 01:15:25,630
less than.
It's not even every day,

1524
01:15:25,631 --> 01:15:28,370
right?
A a cop doing something fucked up.

1525
01:15:28,371 --> 01:15:33,371
It's usually like once a week I think 
I'm fucking millions of interactions 

1526
01:15:33,371 --> 01:15:36,250
these cops have with people.
I mean every day something's going wrong

1527
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:39,010
all over the country.
Someone's pulling someone over that as a

1528
01:15:39,011 --> 01:15:40,690
gun,
someone's pulling something off,

1529
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:45,720
someone over that as an expired license 
or stolen property or they're just 

1530
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,350
constantly dealing with people.
It's amazing.

1531
01:15:47,351 --> 01:15:48,800
I think she was little.
They do.

1532
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,610
There's an argument in,
hey,

1533
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,700
the cops should live in the community.
He's policing.

1534
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:54,770
Yes,
yes.

1535
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:56,450
Yeah.
That most certainly is.

1536
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:58,250
Otherwise you're an outsider.
Right?

1537
01:15:58,251 --> 01:16:01,520
I mean that was a,
how they used to be like the cops.

1538
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:03,470
If you were in,
you know,

1539
01:16:03,890 --> 01:16:08,890
in New Jersey in the 19 seventies,
the cop that was patrolling your 

1540
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:10,100
neighborhood lived in the neighborhood,
it's probably all knew him by name.

1541
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:11,450
Yeah,

1542
01:16:12,930 --> 01:16:17,930
totally.
I like cop friend in Bisbee told me a 

1543
01:16:17,930 --> 01:16:21,621
story about where he had to do a welfare
check and a house and he's forced entry 

1544
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:24,630
and he's yelling,
police,

1545
01:16:24,631 --> 01:16:28,470
we're just here to do a welfare check.
Hello.

1546
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:31,740
Some older guy that could have been 
fucking dead.

1547
01:16:31,741 --> 01:16:34,020
And he's expecting to,
uh,

1548
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:36,600
to find a corpse when no one's 
answering.

1549
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:40,290
And he gets up the staircase and he gets
halfway around.

1550
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:45,500
And this guy with half dementia holding 
a fucking a of 45 on him and he has to 

1551
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:52,110
make that split second decision to draw 
his gun and shoot.

1552
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,640
And he just ducked the other way.
Hey,

1553
01:16:53,641 --> 01:16:55,620
we're just here to make sure you're 
okay.

1554
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:59,100
And he was like that close to taking a 
fucking bullet in the head,

1555
01:16:59,101 --> 01:17:04,101
just trying to make sure a,
a neighbor isn't dead and you okay,

1556
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:09,291
I understand where it's getting some 
fucking Harry predicaments where if he 

1557
01:17:12,021 --> 01:17:13,910
shot this fucking old guy,

1558
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:19,350
oh,
could you imagine shooting old guy in 

1559
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:23,101
his house because he thinks he's 
protecting his house for burglars and 

1560
01:17:23,101 --> 01:17:26,401
you're just there to check to see if 
he's all right and you wind up shooting 

1561
01:17:26,401 --> 01:17:28,711
him in the head and you know,
this just the amount of days in a year 

1562
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:32,890
and the amount of interaction they're 
gonna have with violence.

1563
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:35,320
It's just too much for most people's 
brains.

1564
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:40,560
Almost everybody's brain.
It's almost like being on the front 

1565
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,760
lines for 20 years,
especially if you're in Detroit or South

1566
01:17:42,761 --> 01:17:47,761
side of Chicago or somewhere were 
terrible neighborhood with a dealing 

1567
01:17:47,761 --> 01:17:47,761
with crime all the time.
Camden,

1568
01:17:47,761 --> 01:17:47,890
something like that

1569
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:48,980
was,
uh,

1570
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:49,770
the,
uh,

1571
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:55,000
the thin blue line where our officers 
protect their own fucking bad apples.

1572
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,230
Yeah.
You only need to see,

1573
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,710
you know,
one fucking wormhole run of youtube,

1574
01:18:00,711 --> 01:18:02,220
bad cop videos.
Well,

1575
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:05,060
there's people that are protecting those
cops.

1576
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:10,330
So yeah.
You get a fucking give up your weak 

1577
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:10,330
links.

1578
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:10,980
What is the documentary,
Jamie?

1579
01:18:10,981 --> 01:18:13,080
The seven five.
Is that what it is?

1580
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:15,540
Is that what it's called?
For sure.

1581
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,660
Seventy fifth precinct.
Have you ever seen that?

1582
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:24,000
Michael Dowd is a documentary about a 
crooked cops in New York.

1583
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:25,170
Shit.
Is it good?

1584
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,670
Yeah.
That was really holy Shit.

1585
01:18:26,671 --> 01:18:29,090
Is it good?
And you realize how crazy it got a.

1586
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:34,170
They would just run a thing.
Selling drugs and planning to do hits on

1587
01:18:34,291 --> 01:18:36,000
people like,
Whoa,

1588
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:40,740
isn't really fuck.
That's a good documentary.

1589
01:18:40,741 --> 01:18:43,920
Nick depalo turned me onto that.
That's a good God damn documentary.

1590
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:46,680
I thought they only did stand up comedy 
on Netflix.

1591
01:18:46,681 --> 01:18:49,620
Now they have a lot of God damn 
documentaries.

1592
01:18:49,621 --> 01:18:54,470
Have you seen the wild wild,
the know the wild wild country?

1593
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:55,300
Have you seen?
No,

1594
01:18:55,301 --> 01:18:57,610
I haven't seen that.
I just got back on Netflix.

1595
01:18:57,611 --> 01:19:00,310
I've been out of the country for four 
months basically.

1596
01:19:00,311 --> 01:19:05,311
But uh,
I just watched a evil genius about the.

1597
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:08,470
How's the pizza bomber?
Four parter.

1598
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:09,440
Uh,
yeah,

1599
01:19:09,441 --> 01:19:10,690
it's,
it's really good.

1600
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:14,410
I,
it didn't need to be four parts.

1601
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:18,100
Every documentary you watched could have
been a third shorter.

1602
01:19:18,290 --> 01:19:19,750
Yeah.
Uh,

1603
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,670
but yeah,
that's what the guy with the.

1604
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:23,240
The neck bomb.
Yeah.

1605
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:28,440
And His fucking head blows off.
They send them into a bank and they 

1606
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:29,650
still don't really know if he was 
involved.

1607
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:33,400
He wasn't involved,
but is a really good documentary.

1608
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:35,680
Yeah.
There's a,

1609
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,660
there's just the wild,
wild west.

1610
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:38,990
Wild country is

1611
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:44,060
about a sex cult that took over a town 
in Oregon.

1612
01:19:44,110 --> 01:19:45,160
Oh yeah.
Nineteen 80.

1613
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:48,100
I was looking for that.
That's the one I was looking for,

1614
01:19:48,101 --> 01:19:52,690
but I know it was the Bhagwan shree rush
and I'm like,

1615
01:19:52,691 --> 01:19:57,160
I don't like to search Bhagwan how do I.
I wouldn't even know how to spell that.

1616
01:19:57,161 --> 01:20:00,790
I wouldn't even know how to spell that 
enough for Google to correct it.

1617
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:04,750
I know about this whole thing before the
documentary series came out.

1618
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:07,840
I knew about it.
I never heard of it,

1619
01:20:07,841 --> 01:20:08,040
but

1620
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:13,040
not in depth.
And I've heard it's a fucking brilliant 

1621
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:13,620
documentary,
but I didn't know the name it.

1622
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:15,360
Um,
it's,

1623
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:18,780
I'm amazed I could have,
I just said Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh.

1624
01:20:18,810 --> 01:20:21,800
That is pretty amazing.
I'd just call them Osho.

1625
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:23,040
It's with,
they call them later.

1626
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:24,680
Right.
But it's A.

1627
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:27,750
I didn't know it happened.
I had never.

1628
01:20:27,751 --> 01:20:32,751
I had never heard that this was a thing 
that there was a whole town that gotten 

1629
01:20:32,751 --> 01:20:35,580
taken over by this wacky call.
I never heard a peep about it.

1630
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:37,500
So when this documentary series came 
out,

1631
01:20:37,501 --> 01:20:38,400
this is all,
what,

1632
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:43,530
when was this like totally to you?
Yeah,

1633
01:20:43,531 --> 01:20:47,130
that's how I remember the name,
but I didn't know the details.

1634
01:20:47,131 --> 01:20:47,990
I didn't know that,
you know,

1635
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:51,900
the criminal element of it.
I just was like the,

1636
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:54,660
the Reverend something moon?
Yes.

1637
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:56,520
Yeah,
the moonies.

1638
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:58,680
Yeah.
I just remembered existed.

1639
01:20:58,681 --> 01:21:00,330
I don't know anything about.

1640
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:04,230
Wasn't that Steve Hanson guy?
The guy that's the.

1641
01:21:04,231 --> 01:21:07,350
A cult expert.
Isn't that what he was in?

1642
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:10,350
Wasn't he in the moonies when he wound 
up leaving?

1643
01:21:10,410 --> 01:21:15,410
Was that what it was?
They found him when he was in college 

1644
01:21:15,410 --> 01:21:17,190
and recruited them.
There's a guy who was a,

1645
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:21,220
uh,
an anti cult educator and uh,

1646
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:26,270
he was in one.
He got roped into one when he was in 

1647
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:26,370
college.
Well,

1648
01:21:26,371 --> 01:21:31,371
he's a,
he's Jewish Unification Unification 

1649
01:21:31,371 --> 01:21:32,640
Church,
which is that Mooney's says,

1650
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:35,700
Huh?
What does it say?

1651
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,980
It says Annie founded ECZEMA ink.
So that might be.

1652
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,810
Yeah,
I think it was the moonies.

1653
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:43,890
I think the unification church is sung 
on wounds church.

1654
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:47,800
See if that's true.
Um,

1655
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:48,630
is it?
Yeah.

1656
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,020
So he was,
he was roped up with them when he was in

1657
01:21:52,021 --> 01:21:55,080
college and he got rescued.
Who rescued him?

1658
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:56,490
Someone's family member or something 
like that.

1659
01:21:56,491 --> 01:22:01,491
I forget the whole story,
but I wonder if Alex Jones ever does 

1660
01:22:01,491 --> 01:22:01,491
that.
Hey,

1661
01:22:01,491 --> 01:22:01,560
look that up.
Is that true?

1662
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:02,640
No,
it's not.

1663
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:05,850
No,
I don't think he does.

1664
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,260
You can't believe that fact,
those,

1665
01:22:10,390 --> 01:22:13,140
um,
I just can't believe I never heard about

1666
01:22:13,141 --> 01:22:17,040
that whole story until it went down or 
until the documentary series went down.

1667
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:20,340
I never heard that story.
It's almost like a,

1668
01:22:20,341 --> 01:22:23,160
I was living in an alternative universe,
like how do I slip this?

1669
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,100
They took over a whole town.
How did.

1670
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:28,260
And this is when I was a grown adult,
this was in the late eighties,

1671
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:30,030
like,
how the fuck did I not know about this?

1672
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:36,620
Well,
I fucking scientology did with 

1673
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:36,840
clearwater basically.
Did they?

1674
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:39,060
Well,
I don't know if they took over the town,

1675
01:22:39,061 --> 01:22:42,060
but they close close,
but this,

1676
01:22:42,061 --> 01:22:45,180
these people took over these Mormons in 
Salt Lake.

1677
01:22:45,181 --> 01:22:47,400
How did I not hear about.
When you see it,

1678
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:50,760
you realize the scope of it.
When you see the old home movies,

1679
01:22:50,790 --> 01:22:51,870
you realize like,
oh,

1680
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:52,890
like they,
they,

1681
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:55,500
they made a whole town.

1682
01:22:55,680 --> 01:23:00,680
They took this whole.
They had this ranch and they said they 

1683
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:01,410
couldn't have the ranch.
They couldn't turn it into this town.

1684
01:23:01,411 --> 01:23:03,590
They couldn't develop on it the way they
wanted to because they were.

1685
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:07,560
They were recognizing that these were 
becoming like a,

1686
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:13,250
a giant caught that was next door and 
all these people are moving in and so 

1687
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:13,250
they said,
Oh really?

1688
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:13,250
Okay.
We'll just,

1689
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:17,670
we'll just stop buying the houses in 
this town and knocking on everybody's 

1690
01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:18,100
door and go,
how much do you sell your house for this

1691
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:21,430
tiny little house or a tiny little town?
So just like a busy type place.

1692
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:26,580
They start buying everybody's house and 
then they started shipping in homeless 

1693
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:29,731
people.
They shipped and homeless people and 

1694
01:23:29,731 --> 01:23:29,731
took care of them.
So the homeless people would vote dude.

1695
01:23:29,731 --> 01:23:31,270
The whole thing is they let anybody 
join,

1696
01:23:31,271 --> 01:23:32,620
just get on a bus,
you can join,

1697
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:37,830
and they drove him out there to Utah and
then they created like thousands and 

1698
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:37,830
thousands of people,
Oregon,

1699
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:43,080
thousands of thousands of people and 
they took these people and that they 

1700
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:47,870
made them a part of the community and 
they used them for voting and they took 

1701
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:47,870
over this town.

1702
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:47,870
It's fucking crazy,
man.

1703
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:48,970
When you're watching it,
you're just like,

1704
01:23:49,210 --> 01:23:52,420
how is this not mainstream news that 
this.

1705
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:56,740
How is this not like Jonestown massacre?
So it seems almost more impressive.

1706
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:59,040
Less people died,
but I don't know the,

1707
01:23:59,041 --> 01:23:59,620
the,
the,

1708
01:23:59,621 --> 01:24:02,770
the dark element of that.
That's what I don't remember.

1709
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:05,350
I know that they did some fucked up.
I don't want to give it away.

1710
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:06,300
You got to watch it.
Don't,

1711
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:09,160
don't give it away.
It's fucking amazing.

1712
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:11,500
And what's amazing is they got so much 
footage.

1713
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:14,200
You could see what these guys were like,
like carrying machine guns.

1714
01:24:14,201 --> 01:24:16,430
They took over the police force,
they call it the piece for us,

1715
01:24:16,570 --> 01:24:19,780
but they're all got fucking 
semiautomatic rifles and shit.

1716
01:24:19,781 --> 01:24:23,710
And there was more.
Jeff's in Colorado,

1717
01:24:24,370 --> 01:24:26,470
Utah,
Arizona,

1718
01:24:26,471 --> 01:24:27,670
Utah border.
Yeah.

1719
01:24:27,671 --> 01:24:28,720
He's a Mormon,
right?

1720
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:30,970
He's the.
He was radical political now,

1721
01:24:30,971 --> 01:24:35,971
but he's still running things from 
prison and the family still somewhat a.

1722
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,970
What did they get him on to get him on 
polygamy child.

1723
01:24:39,971 --> 01:24:43,750
He had a fucking,
like a 16 year old wife.

1724
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:47,380
One of his wives.
It was child rape.

1725
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:53,200
There's a good documentary about that.
A false prophet.

1726
01:24:53,201 --> 01:24:57,020
Something Prophet,
a Jew,

1727
01:24:57,021 --> 01:25:02,021
you know that.
That's the whole reason why a Mitt 

1728
01:25:02,021 --> 01:25:02,700
Romney's families from Mexico.
Did you know that?

1729
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:07,740
Know Mitt Romney's family moved to 
Mexico back when they made polygamy 

1730
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:09,370
illegal in Utah.
Oh yeah.

1731
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:10,270
Here,
what is this?

1732
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:16,050
An exclusive look inside the compound.
Warren's Jeff shared with 79 sister 

1733
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:20,761
wives.
He was Hashtag Bolin 79 hits homeboy at 

1734
01:25:22,541 --> 01:25:26,910
79 wives and they're all ugly as fuck.
I got a role.

1735
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:27,610
Hot bitches.
No,

1736
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:33,730
I think it was a hot one that got out.
She's in the documentary?

1737
01:25:35,650 --> 01:25:36,310
Yeah.
The,

1738
01:25:36,311 --> 01:25:38,170
uh,
the Mitt Romney clan.

1739
01:25:38,590 --> 01:25:43,590
They moved to Mexico when they started 
putting all these restrictions on them 

1740
01:25:43,590 --> 01:25:43,660
and the United States,
like,

1741
01:25:43,661 --> 01:25:44,720
no polygamy.
No,

1742
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:48,600
the parents.
Super,

1743
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,210
Super Mormons.
They were.

1744
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,680
They'd polygamist yet?
Well,

1745
01:25:50,681 --> 01:25:53,560
they were in the ones that left and went
to Mexico.

1746
01:25:53,561 --> 01:25:57,730
They were whether they were still 
polygamous when they were his parents,

1747
01:25:57,850 --> 01:26:00,400
I don't know,
but when they initially established that

1748
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:05,430
sect,
they moved to Mexico specifically to 

1749
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:05,430
avoid the laws

1750
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:06,530
of the United States and there are 
several of them.

1751
01:26:06,531 --> 01:26:09,590
There's more than one family there and 
they have to fight off the cartel.

1752
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:13,100
There was a vice piece on it.
Fucking crazy,

1753
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:14,480
man.
These people,

1754
01:26:14,510 --> 01:26:19,220
they are armed to the tits,
wandering around their compound.

1755
01:26:19,221 --> 01:26:22,280
They got fucking barbwire fences 
everywhere and they're worried about the

1756
01:26:22,281 --> 01:26:27,281
cartel coming in and they get kidnapped 
and they have to pay ransom and 

1757
01:26:27,281 --> 01:26:29,780
everybody knows they have money.
It's fucking crazy,

1758
01:26:29,781 --> 01:26:32,960
man.
That's Mitt Romney's parents.

1759
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:38,070
Polygamists versus the cartel.
Yeah.

1760
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:43,570
I forget the name of the vice piece.
Just meet Mitt Romney's Mexican.

1761
01:26:43,571 --> 01:26:45,900
Mormon family drug cartels.
Diverse Mormons.

1762
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:46,990
It's a seven part series.

1763
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:47,970
Yeah.
Oh,

1764
01:26:47,971 --> 01:26:48,840
that's what it's called.
Yeah,

1765
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:51,300
there it is.
It's fucking wild.

1766
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:54,240
So they go over to Mexico and hang out 
with these people.

1767
01:26:54,390 --> 01:26:59,390
You go to Mexico and they have this 
enormous Mormon community in Mexico 

1768
01:26:59,820 --> 01:27:00,590
fortified.

1769
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:02,860
Well,
someone was telling me about,

1770
01:27:02,970 --> 01:27:07,970
uh,
you have some viral piece snapping on 

1771
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:12,200
immigration and anyone who will take 
away their baby

1772
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:14,970
parents.
Yeah.

1773
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:18,430
It was just a,
me and Duncan talking on a podcast about

1774
01:27:18,431 --> 01:27:19,670
how crazy it is.
The people like

1775
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:24,600
good should have broke the law.
Something about trying to get rid of the

1776
01:27:24,601 --> 01:27:27,980
fucking end it if you,
if you believe that's okay,

1777
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:29,970
don't follow me.
Don't listen to me.

1778
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:32,940
What I said.
You sure you're not on the team like the

1779
01:27:32,941 --> 01:27:33,360
team?
Yeah.

1780
01:27:33,370 --> 01:27:35,380
Humans.
Like if we're going to act as a country,

1781
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:40,760
you know,
the thought is we're going to act as a 

1782
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,451
country.
We've got all think we're going to help 

1783
01:27:42,451 --> 01:27:42,451
each other.
We're to support each other.

1784
01:27:42,451 --> 01:27:45,511
We're going to look for the values of 
community from these team members that 

1785
01:27:45,511 --> 01:27:46,990
are on this team together.
But if someone's like,

1786
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:48,310
shouldn't have broke law.
Oh,

1787
01:27:48,311 --> 01:27:50,170
she's losing her kid shouldn't have 
broke the law.

1788
01:27:50,171 --> 01:27:55,171
Like how the fuck you going to let 
someone like that on the team about 

1789
01:27:55,171 --> 01:27:55,171
this.

1790
01:27:55,171 --> 01:27:58,090
Yeah.
Like the way it was described to me last

1791
01:27:58,090 --> 01:28:03,090
night was that you were telling a lot of
your fan base to fuck off and I don't 

1792
01:28:03,090 --> 01:28:07,231
know if you're getting.
What I'm getting is a lot of fucking 

1793
01:28:07,231 --> 01:28:11,640
mag,
a fucking Nazi type shitheads like are 

1794
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:13,510
you.
Yeah,

1795
01:28:14,050 --> 01:28:19,050
and I.
I said it on stage last night that the 

1796
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:22,051
same way people can be offended at a 
buzzword without hearing the whole bit 

1797
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:28,620
because you said contar retard or 
something that they just completely 

1798
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:32,790
tuned out and walk out without hearing 
the context of the whole piece of 

1799
01:28:32,790 --> 01:28:37,411
material the same way people can become 
attracted to you because you said,

1800
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:45,440
you know,
faggot Jew without hearing the context 

1801
01:28:46,061 --> 01:28:49,920
of the bit and like I'm having to force 
people.

1802
01:28:49,930 --> 01:28:53,440
Like I don't want you as a fan.
I have enough fans.

1803
01:28:53,710 --> 01:28:58,300
I've lived my little niche base and you 
can go away and like the Libertarians,

1804
01:28:58,301 --> 01:29:02,490
I have to distance myself from them 
because that was always a split

1805
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:07,820
of know civil libertarians and legalize 
drugs.

1806
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:14,610
That versus snake handling,
homeschooling,

1807
01:29:14,611 --> 01:29:19,611
Christian types that don't want the 
government involved in them raising 

1808
01:29:19,611 --> 01:29:21,600
freak kids.
But now it's like,

1809
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:25,220
it seems like all the good parts are now
just anti-trump,

1810
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:30,290
like we have to vote Democrat and the 
bad parts of the libertarians are the 

1811
01:29:30,481 --> 01:29:33,530
whole now where I'm,
I'm not a fucking lit.

1812
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:37,950
I Lean Libertarian,
not the party,

1813
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,620
but the ethic.
I leaned that way,

1814
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:45,800
but I'm not calling myself a libertarian
anymore because there's a bunch of 

1815
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:47,190
fucking Nazis.
Not all of them,

1816
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:52,220
but I'm saying a lot of people have.
It's become the good parts have left.

1817
01:29:54,810 --> 01:29:59,810
Well,
I think there's just a problem with 

1818
01:29:59,810 --> 01:30:00,510
groups.
Whenever you have groups you're going to

1819
01:30:00,511 --> 01:30:05,511
have the fringe and when you have the 
fringe was the French stupid or the 

1820
01:30:05,511 --> 01:30:05,511
fringe?
Radical.

1821
01:30:05,511 --> 01:30:06,900
Right?
Or the fringe radical left.

1822
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:09,120
They sort of define the group and they 
it.

1823
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:11,040
And if you have a group that anybody can
join,

1824
01:30:11,041 --> 01:30:12,810
like do you have libertarian ideas?
Yes,

1825
01:30:12,811 --> 01:30:17,811
I do.
I support a lot of libertarian 

1826
01:30:17,811 --> 01:30:17,811
philosophy.
Good.

1827
01:30:17,811 --> 01:30:17,940
Become a libertarian.
You'll be with us,

1828
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:19,020
you know.
But there's,

1829
01:30:19,370 --> 01:30:21,600
you know Dave Smith at all from 
legionnaires.

1830
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:23,160
Mayor.
Oh,

1831
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:28,190
different guy.
Dave Smith from New York comic from New 

1832
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:29,100
York.
So legitimate libertarian had they.

1833
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:31,290
I think I just did a podcast with him.
I'm sure he.

1834
01:30:31,291 --> 01:30:33,990
Did you do the skanks in a legion of 
skanks?

1835
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:37,770
Yeah,
but I think it was without big J.

1836
01:30:37,771 --> 01:30:38,520
I don't know.
Okay.

1837
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:43,780
It was as I was promoting my book,
so I was doing like 18 things in a day 

1838
01:30:46,381 --> 01:30:51,381
and drinking the whole time.
I think I'm a little loose on the 

1839
01:30:51,481 --> 01:30:52,890
details.
Yeah,

1840
01:30:52,891 --> 01:30:56,220
I know those kinds of podcasts.
I think there's a,

1841
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:57,350
it's,
it's,

1842
01:30:57,570 --> 01:30:59,820
that's a legitimate,
this podcast where I go,

1843
01:30:59,821 --> 01:31:04,821
you know what,
I'm not going to fucking smoke in his 

1844
01:31:04,821 --> 01:31:04,821
studio this time and I'm not going to 
drink.

1845
01:31:04,821 --> 01:31:05,160
It's worked here.
I am,

1846
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:06,150
but.
But the uh,

1847
01:31:06,151 --> 01:31:08,580
the smoke things working,
it's not bad at all in here.

1848
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:10,470
Right.
It's pretty good.

1849
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:12,240
It's way better than it would be if 
there was no,

1850
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:17,300
no fan thing.
What the fuck were we just talking 

1851
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:17,300
about?
David Smith?

1852
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:18,720
Libertarians.
Yeah.

1853
01:31:18,721 --> 01:31:20,730
But the problem is just being in groups,
man,

1854
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:25,110
you know,
like identifying as a right wing,

1855
01:31:25,111 --> 01:31:27,020
identifying as a left way.
I didn't.

1856
01:31:27,670 --> 01:31:29,640
So,
so many people that identify.

1857
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:34,710
You just grab those ideas.
Usually one issue.

1858
01:31:36,030 --> 01:31:37,140
Immigration.
Yeah.

1859
01:31:37,470 --> 01:31:41,100
I'm against it,
so I'm right wing the rest of your day,

1860
01:31:41,101 --> 01:31:43,980
your abortion.
If your pro your pro choice,

1861
01:31:43,981 --> 01:31:48,981
you have to be left wing.
Like there's the right wing people that 

1862
01:31:48,981 --> 01:31:48,981
go pro choice,
they get attacked.

1863
01:31:50,230 --> 01:31:55,230
That's one of those weird things where I
think racism will stop them.

1864
01:31:56,341 --> 01:31:59,350
Overturning Roe vs Dot Wade.
Racism will.

1865
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:00,070
Yeah,
there you go

1866
01:32:00,630 --> 01:32:05,630
there against abortions,
but not for all these Mexicans having 

1867
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:08,950
all these kids.
That might be the only way.

1868
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:13,780
Right.
I was always on Frankie Boyle show and I

1869
01:32:13,781 --> 01:32:14,790
was saying that,
uh,

1870
01:32:15,490 --> 01:32:18,190
that's the only way that,
uh,

1871
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:23,450
uh,
of trump would overturn a gun control 

1872
01:32:23,530 --> 01:32:28,530
put in gun control laws is because 
school shootings are the only time he's 

1873
01:32:28,530 --> 01:32:33,241
not on CNN when that it takes like 30 
people to die on a school yard before 

1874
01:32:35,771 --> 01:32:38,020
CNN stops talking about them for a 
minute,

1875
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:43,860
steals his air time.
We're going to abandon going to ban 

1876
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:46,410
these assault rifles because I'm not 
getting air tight.

1877
01:32:46,450 --> 01:32:48,940
They're talking about these dead kids 
get me back on TV.

1878
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,770
Even if they had a story about a school 
shooting,

1879
01:32:51,771 --> 01:32:53,960
they would have Russia scrolling across 
the bottom.

1880
01:32:54,630 --> 01:32:57,950
The scroll across the bottom is like the
ultimate insult to your attention span.

1881
01:32:58,330 --> 01:33:03,330
It's like,
I know you can't pay attention to just 

1882
01:33:03,330 --> 01:33:03,330
what's on the screen.
Stupid.

1883
01:33:03,330 --> 01:33:03,890
So I want to give you some extra data.
How about the stock market?

1884
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:08,900
I'll leave it for you up here.
You know how much money you're losing 

1885
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:10,871
constantly and then fall this ticker 
tape of sadness and despair below you in

1886
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:12,080
the stocks?
No,

1887
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:17,200
I mean I have a business manager and 
some of it's invested in some different 

1888
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:17,660
things,
but I don't pay attention to it.

1889
01:33:17,770 --> 01:33:18,360
I,
I,

1890
01:33:18,370 --> 01:33:23,370
I get,
I get some stocks were of a friend of 

1891
01:33:23,370 --> 01:33:26,780
mine talked me into and I,
I get it like every couple months.

1892
01:33:26,781 --> 01:33:31,781
My stockbroker caused dog.
It's stay via for I want to make some 

1893
01:33:31,781 --> 01:33:36,491
moves and the last time I actually wrote
down he'll just start spewing this 

1894
01:33:36,491 --> 01:33:41,260
jargon where I put them on speaker phone
in the van when we're on the road so 

1895
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:43,160
everyone can hear his is just.
I go,

1896
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:46,460
I do you fist pump.
Are you on top of a desk?

1897
01:33:46,461 --> 01:33:51,461
Like wolf of Wall Street,
fist pumping as you're selling me this 

1898
01:33:51,461 --> 01:33:52,610
bullshit because I have no idea what 
you're talking about.

1899
01:33:57,350 --> 01:33:58,270
But I,
I,

1900
01:33:58,970 --> 01:34:00,880
it's fun.
Like I,

1901
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:06,470
I get stocks like I think like initially
it was like in everything terrible like 

1902
01:34:06,651 --> 01:34:10,940
Philip Morris and craft and big Jose.
Can I add?

1903
01:34:11,030 --> 01:34:13,940
Can the craft.
I love kraft macaroni and cheese.

1904
01:34:13,941 --> 01:34:15,230
Could that be my stock?
I go,

1905
01:34:15,231 --> 01:34:20,231
yeah,
you could look it up for the USA Today 

1906
01:34:20,231 --> 01:34:20,231
to see if it went up or down.

1907
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:22,300
Yeah,
the tobacco money.

1908
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:27,800
I mean you smoke cigarettes,
you should be allowed to invest in 

1909
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:27,800
tobacco.

1910
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:29,170
But yeah,
they were into a lot of other shit too.

1911
01:34:29,410 --> 01:34:30,280
Sure.
I don't.

1912
01:34:30,310 --> 01:34:35,310
I don't know if I own that anymore.
I was at Pfizer stock and it's a good 

1913
01:34:35,310 --> 01:34:39,670
one to viagara kraft macaroni and cheese
and fucking cigarettes.

1914
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:41,400
Sure.
Just the stock market right?

1915
01:34:41,450 --> 01:34:46,450
Self,
like just trying to pay attention to 

1916
01:34:46,450 --> 01:34:49,211
that too.
On top of all the other shit you're 

1917
01:34:49,211 --> 01:34:51,251
supposed to be paying attention to.
It's supposed to be paying attention to 

1918
01:34:51,251 --> 01:34:53,150
stocks and bonds and up and down and

1919
01:34:54,090 --> 01:34:54,530
yeah.
I,

1920
01:34:54,531 --> 01:34:58,220
I stopped paying attention because I'd 
get calls where he's moving

1921
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:03,220
it into this and I don't know,
and then I have to fucking look up fits 

1922
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:07,040
up or down in a few shit.
You're working on your act and if you're

1923
01:35:07,041 --> 01:35:12,041
working on a year,
if you can do your podcast or you're 

1924
01:35:12,041 --> 01:35:12,041
working on your act or getting ready to 
go on the road,

1925
01:35:12,041 --> 01:35:15,410
you're going over your material.
How much fucking time do you have to pay

1926
01:35:15,411 --> 01:35:18,620
attention to the stock market and really
know what you're investing in?

1927
01:35:18,650 --> 01:35:20,150
Really doing the research on the 
company.

1928
01:35:20,151 --> 01:35:25,151
I don't of course know it's crazy.
I get reports and I see if this number 

1929
01:35:26,691 --> 01:35:29,870
is higher than this number.
This has no fucking time.

1930
01:35:29,871 --> 01:35:34,100
Douglas,
there's no time for you.

1931
01:35:34,130 --> 01:35:39,130
There's no time because you do a lot of 
shit and you're very ambitious to two.

1932
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:44,320
A two and almost a pathological extent 
where I have all the fucking time in the

1933
01:35:45,531 --> 01:35:48,950
world and I'm always riddled with 
anxiety.

1934
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:53,570
Like I can't.
I do nothing but I can enjoy it.

1935
01:35:53,930 --> 01:35:58,930
It's not like I'm relaxed,
like there's something I should be 

1936
01:35:58,930 --> 01:35:58,930
dealing all the time too.
Where I'm,

1937
01:35:59,030 --> 01:36:03,290
I'm paralyzed in bed because I don't 
know what it is they should be doing.

1938
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:08,120
I know there's something,
but I think if you do more things,

1939
01:36:08,150 --> 01:36:13,150
that feeling goes away.
I could do like if you do things that 

1940
01:36:13,150 --> 01:36:14,150
you're,
you're really tuned into things that are

1941
01:36:14,151 --> 01:36:18,380
like require your attention than the 
anxiety of not doing things goes away.

1942
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:20,780
Then it just becomes a matter of doing 
things.

1943
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,550
Yeah.
I want to enjoy doing nothing.

1944
01:36:22,551 --> 01:36:27,551
Like I told you after this week,
by the time this airs it'll be Monday 

1945
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:31,610
and I will be retired and I do this as 
often as I can.

1946
01:36:31,611 --> 01:36:35,690
Every few years I quit comedy in my mind
where I just.

1947
01:36:35,691 --> 01:36:37,010
I have nothing on the books.

1948
01:36:37,010 --> 01:36:39,740
I have no dates booked.
Now I don't have an act.

1949
01:36:39,741 --> 01:36:44,741
I have used this act in every fucking 
English speaking place that I've done.

1950
01:36:45,410 --> 01:36:46,910
You know,
all of us.

1951
01:36:46,911 --> 01:36:49,370
And now I've done everything 
international.

1952
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:54,520
I've done fucking ex pats in Vietnam 
have heard this fucking act and I have 

1953
01:36:54,561 --> 01:36:56,520
to start from scratch.
And that's you.

1954
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:58,460
That's.
We talked about this.

1955
01:36:58,461 --> 01:37:02,510
You're starting a new hour ruthless as 
it was process.

1956
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:06,090
So I want to have that moment in 
mentally where I go,

1957
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:08,600
I can do anything in the world right 
now.

1958
01:37:08,601 --> 01:37:10,550
I can just,
I can fuck off.

1959
01:37:10,551 --> 01:37:13,790
I could write another book or I could,
but I,

1960
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:18,940
I have no commitment just having that 
and I still won't enjoy it because 

1961
01:37:19,401 --> 01:37:21,500
they'll just sit there.
Anxiety fueled to go.

1962
01:37:22,330 --> 01:37:24,560
I should do something.
Well,

1963
01:37:24,561 --> 01:37:29,561
we're always looking for a break.
We're always looking for that moment of 

1964
01:37:29,561 --> 01:37:29,561
relaxation.

1965
01:37:29,561 --> 01:37:30,110
A moment of I just,
ah,

1966
01:37:30,410 --> 01:37:34,580
but sometimes your brain is a wire.
That means having nothing.

1967
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:39,020
Like I don't want to have a gig booked a
fucking year from now.

1968
01:37:39,021 --> 01:37:40,940
So when you do that,
do you feel good?

1969
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,550
You've done it a few times.
I,

1970
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:46,050
I can make it a few months.
It's,

1971
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:46,650
I,
I'm not.

1972
01:37:46,670 --> 01:37:48,900
I'm not a person who needs to be on 
stage.

1973
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,420
I can not do that,
but I have to do.

1974
01:37:52,670 --> 01:37:57,670
No.
I drink too much because I have no 

1975
01:37:57,670 --> 01:37:57,930
reason not to.
Hey sure.

1976
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:00,810
Mimosas at 11.
Well that's not going to stop.

1977
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:02,340
Well,
you've written two books now.

1978
01:38:02,490 --> 01:38:07,490
Yeah.
Do you write books during those periods 

1979
01:38:07,490 --> 01:38:11,160
or do you just during normal times I 
wrote those two books because I agreed 

1980
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:14,160
to and cash the check first.
Then you have to write the book.

1981
01:38:14,850 --> 01:38:19,800
I'm not a guy who does things on Spec.
Hey,

1982
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:25,010
this is a great idea for a TV show.
Let me write it up and shop it around.

1983
01:38:25,261 --> 01:38:26,100
No,
yeah,

1984
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:31,400
I get to check first or I signed the 
contract first or I agree to do the gig 

1985
01:38:31,591 --> 01:38:32,880
first and then go,
ah,

1986
01:38:32,970 --> 01:38:37,970
fuck.
I'm going to have to have a new hour 

1987
01:38:37,970 --> 01:38:38,880
before I do that tour start writing.

1988
01:38:41,860 --> 01:38:42,580
But uh,
again,

1989
01:38:42,581 --> 01:38:43,210
I,
I,

1990
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:48,360
I have minimal needs.
My Shit's paid for and I don't have 

1991
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:49,300
kids.
I'm not in a,

1992
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:50,590
not in a pickle.
Like,

1993
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:54,070
you know,
you've done it really well as far as how

1994
01:38:54,071 --> 01:38:57,190
to manage your time,
manage your time and manage your,

1995
01:38:57,191 --> 01:38:58,270
uh,
your freedom.

1996
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:02,210
You got it in a good place.
He'd been very smart with money too.

1997
01:39:02,900 --> 01:39:06,410
You didn't do anything stupid and get 
drawn out,

1998
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:08,440
you know?
Yeah.

1999
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:10,280
Live low.
Yeah.

2000
01:39:10,281 --> 01:39:12,770
Just slip smart.
Buy Thrift store clothes.

2001
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,970
Live in a small town.
It's a good way to do it,

2002
01:39:16,971 --> 01:39:17,680
man.
I mean the,

2003
01:39:17,710 --> 01:39:22,710
the,
I think what I seek that I don't have 

2004
01:39:22,710 --> 01:39:23,450
right now is the balance between,
uh,

2005
01:39:23,690 --> 01:39:28,690
the large numbers of people,
the pressure and then more downtime.

2006
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:32,880
Like I feel like I don't have enough 
downtime and then I just think as a,

2007
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:35,630
just as a person is paying attention to 
way my brain works,

2008
01:39:35,930 --> 01:39:37,760
I'm like,
this is not that healthy.

2009
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,120
Like I'm doing too many things.
Like I should have less things to do.

2010
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:44,700
It was so much fun to watch you at that.
Uh,

2011
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:49,220
what's the show you did the stand up off
the top of your head.

2012
01:39:49,430 --> 01:39:51,770
Stand up on the spot.
Stand up on the spot.

2013
01:39:51,830 --> 01:39:53,060
Yeah.
And he was like,

2014
01:39:53,061 --> 01:39:54,350
yeah,
it's really fun.

2015
01:39:54,351 --> 01:39:55,450
Come on up.
And uh,

2016
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:57,780
yeah,
you just uh,

2017
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:02,800
and I saw you do that the last time I 
was in town and it was fucking 

2018
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:02,800
brilliant.
I go,

2019
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:07,090
that was just,
you were just riffing that that's not 

2020
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:07,090
because you were talking about.
Yeah,

2021
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:11,561
I only have like 10 minutes.
Like I'm trying to write a new act that 

2022
01:40:11,561 --> 01:40:15,341
I only have like 10 minutes of good 
material and then I watched you do 10 

2023
01:40:15,341 --> 01:40:15,680
minutes off the fucking top of your 
head.

2024
01:40:15,681 --> 01:40:20,681
That was brilliant,
but it was really funny to see you in 

2025
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:20,681
that backbar.
God.

2026
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:22,130
Yeah,
but I gotta be fucked up to do it.

2027
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:25,670
Drinks.
You kind of have to be.

2028
01:40:25,710 --> 01:40:28,130
I've done that show sober.
It's a.

2029
01:40:28,131 --> 01:40:31,190
You want to be super high and at least 
two drinks in.

2030
01:40:31,940 --> 01:40:33,740
That's what you want.
You want to be lit.

2031
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:39,700
You don't want to be too late because 
then they'll go down a dumb path that 

2032
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:43,871
doesn't really work.
Like you want to be good enough that 

2033
01:40:43,871 --> 01:40:43,871
you're.
You're lubed.

2034
01:40:43,871 --> 01:40:43,871
Yeah.
Yeah.

2035
01:40:43,871 --> 01:40:45,380
You're lubed,
but you're still.

2036
01:40:45,410 --> 01:40:47,570
You're still moving good.
You still go,

2037
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:48,350
oh,
okay.

2038
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:50,030
Here's what's wrong with that.
Whom?

2039
01:40:50,180 --> 01:40:55,180
And then you go right into it.
Let's just start talking and wait for 

2040
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:55,180
the funny words to come

2041
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:55,180
out.
Don't pause.

2042
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:58,900
Yeah,
don't think about what's just exercise.

2043
01:40:58,901 --> 01:41:01,630
Those weird.
A improvisational muscles,

2044
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:03,310
you know,
but it doesn't always work.

2045
01:41:03,311 --> 01:41:06,760
My last one was not good.
I did one like a month and a half ago or

2046
01:41:06,761 --> 01:41:07,990
two months ago.
When was the last one?

2047
01:41:07,991 --> 01:41:09,640
It wasn't good.
I got nothing out of it.

2048
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:13,240
Sometimes it just get nothing.
Do you record always?

2049
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:14,060
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2050
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:19,680
That you.
You get these gems out of that show 

2051
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:19,680
where you like,
oh Jesus,

2052
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:20,500
this is my next five minutes.
I've got it.

2053
01:41:20,501 --> 01:41:21,940
It's right there.
I know where this goes.

2054
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:26,970
This is going to go to that and that'll 
go to this and I can tie it all 

2055
01:41:26,970 --> 01:41:26,970
together.
Boom.

2056
01:41:26,970 --> 01:41:28,150
And you'll,
I record.

2057
01:41:28,151 --> 01:41:31,610
But it to get to that Jen,
if I just did a,

2058
01:41:31,630 --> 01:41:33,790
you know,
an hour and 40 minutes,

2059
01:41:34,150 --> 01:41:37,150
hammered and I.
There was three things usually.

2060
01:41:37,610 --> 01:41:42,610
Bingo used to be on the road with me and
she would sit in the back with a yellow 

2061
01:41:42,610 --> 01:41:45,190
legal pad and she knows my act,
so if I come up with something new,

2062
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:46,570
she'll write that down.

2063
01:41:46,570 --> 01:41:48,730
And the next day in the van Gogh,
Oh,

2064
01:41:48,731 --> 01:41:50,110
you said this,
she said this.

2065
01:41:50,111 --> 01:41:50,860
I'm like,
Oh fuck,

2066
01:41:50,861 --> 01:41:53,410
that's great.
And you don't have to listen to yourself

2067
01:41:53,411 --> 01:41:55,950
and cringe for fucking,
dude.

2068
01:41:55,990 --> 01:42:00,990
Here's a thing.
Listening to yourself and cringing is 

2069
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:00,990
good for the.
I know it's the best thing.

2070
01:42:01,030 --> 01:42:06,030
It's good for this thing you can do and 
but at the same time I hate myself so 

2071
01:42:06,030 --> 01:42:09,820
much that it's disheartening.
Is that what I sound like?

2072
01:42:09,821 --> 01:42:12,700
I shouldn't do this.
I fucking suck.

2073
01:42:12,790 --> 01:42:16,930
A familiarity breeds contempt and when 
it's yourself too.

2074
01:42:16,931 --> 01:42:21,931
If you're going to be worth a fuck,
you're going to be hypercritical of 

2075
01:42:21,931 --> 01:42:21,931
yourself.
It's just a fact.

2076
01:42:21,931 --> 01:42:24,160
So you're watching or listening to 
yourself and just like,

2077
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:26,840
oh,
shut the fuck up.

2078
01:42:28,910 --> 01:42:33,910
I heckled myself alone,
listening to myself and dropbox and I'm 

2079
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:36,040
like,
just get to the fucking point.

2080
01:42:36,670 --> 01:42:38,860
Yelling at myself.
What do you record with you?

2081
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:42,970
Record with your phone?
Daily records using an MP,

2082
01:42:42,971 --> 01:42:47,971
three players to little unit that we 
were on the road and we just bring two 

2083
01:42:48,821 --> 01:42:52,090
mikes to podcast on that little thing.
Zoom?

2084
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:53,380
Yeah,
zoom.

2085
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:54,960
Yeah,
that'll be better at I,

2086
01:42:54,961 --> 01:42:59,961
I do it on my phone just so I have them 
there all the time and then I listened 

2087
01:42:59,961 --> 01:43:02,740
to him on my way home.
But I have a ritual I listened to set on

2088
01:43:02,741 --> 01:43:06,400
the way home unless I don't have to.
Like if I do a set and I'm like that was

2089
01:43:06,401 --> 01:43:08,860
just textbook.
There was this by the book on autopilot.

2090
01:43:08,861 --> 01:43:09,340
That one?
Yeah,

2091
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:15,280
but if there was some new bit or one of 
those stand up on the spot shows I 

2092
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:19,501
listened to it all the way home and then
once I get home then I'll break out the 

2093
01:43:19,501 --> 01:43:19,501
laptop.

2094
01:43:19,501 --> 01:43:20,670
Then I'll start writing just like,
all right,

2095
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:25,680
I got the spark going,
let's see what the fuck comes out of 

2096
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:25,900
this.
And I just feel like a lot of it is just

2097
01:43:25,901 --> 01:43:27,970
throwing shit against the wall until 
something sticks.

2098
01:43:27,971 --> 01:43:29,860
And if you don't,
if you're not out there throwing shit,

2099
01:43:30,220 --> 01:43:33,100
it's not going to stick.
But bold while you're doing it,

2100
01:43:33,190 --> 01:43:38,190
you can't believe them throwing all this
shit but then swap a lot of times when 

2101
01:43:38,190 --> 01:43:40,480
when you get so bored with a bit,
you know,

2102
01:43:40,550 --> 01:43:43,420
like this,
like any special.

2103
01:43:43,421 --> 01:43:45,640
I probably have three.
All right,

2104
01:43:45,780 --> 01:43:50,780
this I have to do these three bits,
but then you're tired of them and then I

2105
01:43:51,381 --> 01:43:51,980
just start

2106
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:55,880
fucking around with it just to make it 
interesting for me.

2107
01:43:56,210 --> 01:43:59,420
And that's a lot of the times where you 
find,

2108
01:43:59,450 --> 01:44:00,830
oh this,
this works.

2109
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:02,930
Sometimes it works better,
right?

2110
01:44:02,990 --> 01:44:04,250
Yeah.
Sometimes you'll find,

2111
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:09,280
I mean comedy is one of those weird 
things that you have to do in front of 

2112
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:09,280
people.
You can,

2113
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:11,960
you can write and you'll.
You can get seeds,

2114
01:44:11,961 --> 01:44:14,450
but you got to plant those seeds in the 
dirt of the crowd.

2115
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:18,920
This is the only way.
It's the only way I can see it.

2116
01:44:18,921 --> 01:44:22,460
Occasionally I'll come up with a bit and
it's done when I come up with it.

2117
01:44:22,490 --> 01:44:25,310
Like I know I know the premise,
I have a setup,

2118
01:44:25,311 --> 01:44:26,750
I got the punchline,
boom,

2119
01:44:26,870 --> 01:44:31,870
and it's done.
And he could bring it to the stage and 

2120
01:44:31,870 --> 01:44:33,851
never changes.
But that's like one out of 100 bits 

2121
01:44:33,851 --> 01:44:33,851
maybe,
right?

2122
01:44:33,851 --> 01:44:37,960
Yeah.
This was my first show in the states 

2123
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:38,810
since March.

2124
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:43,810
I started in Southeast Asia and 
Australia and Canada and the UK and I 

2125
01:44:43,971 --> 01:44:48,971
go,
I know a lot of these tags are going to 

2126
01:44:48,971 --> 01:44:50,210
fucking work if I ever get back to the 
states.

2127
01:44:50,270 --> 01:44:51,350
Yeah.
Like this is,

2128
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:54,710
this is not getting what it should get.
But it's also.

2129
01:44:55,280 --> 01:45:00,280
And there was other bits.
Last night was my first show in the 

2130
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,000
states where like,
I'm really excited to see it.

2131
01:45:02,090 --> 01:45:07,090
Usually it's the opposite where I go,
I don't know if any of this is gonna 

2132
01:45:07,090 --> 01:45:07,700
work in fucking Europe.
Right?

2133
01:45:07,710 --> 01:45:11,510
Right now it's like,
I can't wait to see what works.

2134
01:45:11,570 --> 01:45:14,210
Like what people will get offended at 
that they never,

2135
01:45:14,270 --> 01:45:17,040
they don't give a fuck in Australia is 
this,

2136
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:22,280
it's never too brutal there.
But that you have with the a seismic 

2137
01:45:22,551 --> 01:45:26,660
shift in the political and social 
landscape now.

2138
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,520
It really has been seismic,
right?

2139
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:29,630
Yeah.
Yeah.

2140
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:34,840
But I,
my audience is pretty much immune to 

2141
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:35,240
that.
Yeah.

2142
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:37,970
Hey,
you can't talk about this anymore.

2143
01:45:38,060 --> 01:45:41,900
I can.
My reinforces your audience.

2144
01:45:41,901 --> 01:45:44,150
It reinforces your relationship with the
audience because they know,

2145
01:45:44,151 --> 01:45:46,670
oh,
we'll doug will give us the real deal.

2146
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,220
He'll give us real comedy.
You know,

2147
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:51,020
people are scared to do real comedy.
Right now.

2148
01:45:51,021 --> 01:45:55,370
Real comedy is.
Requires occasionally requires a fence.

2149
01:45:56,770 --> 01:45:57,530
I don't.
I don't.

2150
01:45:57,620 --> 01:46:02,620
I don't have a sponsor or a network that
can sanction me.

2151
01:46:04,070 --> 01:46:06,020
They will fire you for anything.
Now.

2152
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:08,450
It's the weirdest time ever.
Her getting fired.

2153
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:11,900
People getting fired for things that 
don't make any sense.

2154
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:16,990
I'm not popular enough to get protested 
or people try to lean on the venue.

2155
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:21,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

2156
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:24,290
I think it will be good for me.
Well,

2157
01:46:24,380 --> 01:46:29,300
Jamie was you that said the Kanye West,
the people calling the area at the time.

2158
01:46:29,301 --> 01:46:31,860
We live in cancel culture at this.
Cancel.

2159
01:46:31,890 --> 01:46:35,720
This is canceled culture that everybody 
is just looking at cats.

2160
01:46:36,110 --> 01:46:37,310
Cancel.
Cancel.

2161
01:46:37,311 --> 01:46:41,300
Roseanne Barr to that batch I was 
talking to you about.

2162
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:46,340
At the same time,
I have to like watch how I phrase things

2163
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:50,100
because I don't want that fucking 
element.

2164
01:46:51,670 --> 01:46:54,630
I'm talking in hyperbole.
Yeah.

2165
01:46:54,631 --> 01:46:59,550
They're not Nazis,
but a lot of people that are fuckheads I

2166
01:46:59,551 --> 01:47:04,551
don't want that group.
I am not like anti me to by any means,

2167
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:10,430
although I do make jokes about it and I 
have raped material and I have,

2168
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:16,160
but I got you.
It's almost like the fucking meat to 

2169
01:47:16,351 --> 01:47:20,370
movement has pushed to fucking Maggot 
people into my court and like,

2170
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:22,890
Hey,
don't fucking move them over here.

2171
01:47:23,950 --> 01:47:25,730
That's funny.
Yeah,

2172
01:47:27,710 --> 01:47:29,260
it's a.
it's a funny time.

2173
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:34,520
It's a time of great communication for 
good or for bad and probably for both,

2174
01:47:37,090 --> 01:47:40,060
but there's more communication going on 
right now.

2175
01:47:40,210 --> 01:47:43,630
Then pretty much ever anytime that I 
could ever remember

2176
01:47:46,510 --> 01:47:51,510
furrowing my brow at what you mean by 
communication because I think as a lot 

2177
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:53,910
of misinformation,

2178
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:59,380
not saying like spectacular lines of 
thinking that lead to transformative 

2179
01:47:59,470 --> 01:48:00,470
dialogues.
Right,

2180
01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:05,760
but is it just Yapping pee?
More and more people are yapping and 

2181
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:08,801
comments there.
Yapping on twitter that yapping on 

2182
01:48:08,801 --> 01:48:11,831
facebook and instagram is more yapping.
It's more blogs and yapping and video 

2183
01:48:11,961 --> 01:48:16,961
yapping.
There's more communication as a lot of 

2184
01:48:16,961 --> 01:48:18,170
opinions.
Twitter feed where you go,

2185
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:21,310
hey,
you used to write jokes on here and now.

2186
01:48:21,330 --> 01:48:26,330
No,
I already put a whole thing about all 

2187
01:48:26,330 --> 01:48:27,770
these comedians like saying things that 
aren't even remotely funny about issues

2188
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:34,140
and how how uninformed are a lot of 
those opinions,

2189
01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:39,610
like if you questioned a lot of these 
comics,

2190
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:44,930
like three levels below the surface,
how much do you really know about this 

2191
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:51,240
issue that you're speaking about?
Because I remember when I was vaguely,

2192
01:48:52,570 --> 01:48:57,570
not even political,
but I was really like into the 

2193
01:48:57,570 --> 01:49:00,211
libertarian thing and if you question 
and I was open about it,

2194
01:49:00,341 --> 01:49:04,120
listen,
everything I know on that subject is the

2195
01:49:04,121 --> 01:49:09,121
bit that I did you question.
That's just surface knowledge enough to 

2196
01:49:09,521 --> 01:49:14,521
make it funny and then I move on.
I'm not home studying this shit 

2197
01:49:14,521 --> 01:49:18,000
afterwards like I know enough to make a 
salient point which I.

2198
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:20,080
I can stand behind,
but if,

2199
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:24,880
if you had me on a panel talking about 
it now all all I know is the bit.

2200
01:49:25,060 --> 01:49:28,870
That was the extent of my knowledge with
a fist fuck joke at the end.

2201
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:31,830
Yeah.
Against.

2202
01:49:31,850 --> 01:49:32,820
Too much shit to.
No,

2203
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:37,890
there's no way you could know most of 
the issues that are pressing today.

2204
01:49:37,950 --> 01:49:40,140
There's no way.
If you have an actual job,

2205
01:49:40,141 --> 01:49:43,380
but an actual life and friends and shit 
you like to do,

2206
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:48,920
there's no way.
So we've got a bunch of people that are 

2207
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:48,920
arguing about shit that they're not even
barely informed.

2208
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:50,860
My brain is beaten to a pulp where I,
again,

2209
01:49:50,861 --> 01:49:53,440
I,
I read a book two days later,

2210
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:58,500
I remember if I liked it or not,
and I might remember one fact from that 

2211
01:50:00,250 --> 01:50:02,700
that I can turn into a bit.
Right.

2212
01:50:02,870 --> 01:50:03,510
And then,

2213
01:50:04,610 --> 01:50:09,610
yeah.
What do you think your brain is 

2214
01:50:09,610 --> 01:50:09,610
occupying?
Like W,

2215
01:50:09,610 --> 01:50:11,810
W,
how do you think it's an operating?

2216
01:50:12,020 --> 01:50:17,020
Do you think your brain is operating at 
50 percent of what it was when you were 

2217
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:17,750
21,
75 percent?

2218
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:23,270
I care about a lot less.
Right.

2219
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:25,640
So I.
So how much of it is that?

2220
01:50:27,590 --> 01:50:32,590
Well,
I made a lot of it is fucking alcohol 

2221
01:50:32,590 --> 01:50:32,590
under age.
Yeah.

2222
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:37,760
I,
I blame the alcohol probably as much as 

2223
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:41,020
I should,
but I know people that are my age that I

2224
01:50:41,210 --> 01:50:43,870
can't remember a fucking thing and they 
don't drink

2225
01:50:44,770 --> 01:50:47,020
well.
I think too many things happen to people

2226
01:50:47,021 --> 01:50:52,021
in their lives too.
I think it's impossible to remember 

2227
01:50:52,021 --> 01:50:52,021
everything,
you know,

2228
01:50:52,021 --> 01:50:56,401
they have that thing where you can only 
keep a certain amount of people in your 

2229
01:50:56,401 --> 01:50:57,940
brain told Dunbar's number,
certain amount of people in your tribe,

2230
01:50:57,941 --> 01:51:02,941
like 150 people and keep intimate 
relationships with 150 people in your 

2231
01:51:02,941 --> 01:51:06,751
brain.
I bet that's the case with life 

2232
01:51:06,751 --> 01:51:07,300
experiences too.
I bet that's the case with information.

2233
01:51:07,301 --> 01:51:12,301
I bet that's the case.
I think you only have a certain amount 

2234
01:51:12,301 --> 01:51:14,641
of database space in your brain and I 
think some people really exercise it and

2235
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:18,580
expand the capacity and get it pretty 
impressive,

2236
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:21,010
but there's still only room for a 
certain amount of shit.

2237
01:51:21,490 --> 01:51:26,490
There's just.
If you're really paying attention to 

2238
01:51:26,490 --> 01:51:29,161
some things,
the other things you kind of kind of 

2239
01:51:29,161 --> 01:51:31,021
half ass.
It was just the way of being a person 

2240
01:51:31,021 --> 01:51:31,021
we're not designed for,
you know,

2241
01:51:31,021 --> 01:51:35,620
a perfect output in every single 
category of things that we do.

2242
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:40,980
We're designed to pay a lot of attention
to some things and as long as like food 

2243
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:44,551
and shelter is taking care of,
kind of barely pay attention to other 

2244
01:51:44,551 --> 01:51:44,551
things.
Yeah,

2245
01:51:44,551 --> 01:51:46,690
that's what we do mostly,
but today that the chatter,

2246
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:49,060
the Yap and back and forth and people 
wanting to be.

2247
01:51:49,061 --> 01:51:50,170
Right.
I mean I've watched.

2248
01:51:50,670 --> 01:51:55,670
I've watched battles like twitter 
battles all day long sometimes just 

2249
01:51:55,670 --> 01:51:57,400
watch these people go back and forth.
Everybody just trying to be right.

2250
01:51:58,660 --> 01:52:01,780
That's never happened before.
There was never this much because people

2251
01:52:01,781 --> 01:52:04,000
are doing this mostly probably while 
they're at work,

2252
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:09,120
right?
There's supposed to be doing other shit 

2253
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:09,120
and like,
oh yeah,

2254
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:09,120
I'll show you you fucking piece of shit.
You fucking Nazi,

2255
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:14,060
you know,
and they're just typing shit at each 

2256
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:15,931
other and going back and forth with each
other when they're not getting anything 

2257
01:52:15,931 --> 01:52:15,931
done.

2258
01:52:15,931 --> 01:52:19,810
I have someone like that.
It's an old bit about nationalism,

2259
01:52:20,121 --> 01:52:25,121
but because of the current climate,
people tweet that clip a lot and then 

2260
01:52:26,270 --> 01:52:31,270
because my name is in,
then they start an intellectual twitter 

2261
01:52:31,270 --> 01:52:33,620
war,
which is the worst when people are using

2262
01:52:33,621 --> 01:52:37,250
big words and fucking lots of facts and 
you know,

2263
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:42,370
excerpts from smart fuck magazine in a,
in a twitter battle like right.

2264
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:47,380
It's one thing you have,
fuck your mother and my team's better 

2265
01:52:47,380 --> 01:52:50,651
than your team and that shit,
but when they're having these entered 

2266
01:52:50,651 --> 01:52:53,950
intellectual discourses about whatever 
fucking climate change her know 

2267
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:59,860
nationalism or immigration,
but they keep me in the fucking thing 

2268
01:52:59,860 --> 01:53:02,750
because it started with a a,
a youtube clip.

2269
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:07,840
So my name,
my handle is in there and they don't 

2270
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:11,201
take me out of the fucking thing.
So I'm involved in these long threads 

2271
01:53:11,201 --> 01:53:14,420
between two assholes who are trying to 
outsmart each other.

2272
01:53:14,540 --> 01:53:18,620
You're doing this on twitter.
You can't have a legitimate argument.

2273
01:53:18,621 --> 01:53:23,621
That's what I told Rosanne.
Don't fucking try to tweet your way out 

2274
01:53:23,621 --> 01:53:24,530
of this.
If you're going to tweet it all,

2275
01:53:24,650 --> 01:53:29,650
just keep tweeting and crazy shit til it
puts the tweet and question into this 

2276
01:53:30,350 --> 01:53:35,350
fog of war.
If I was like a fucking cleaner.

2277
01:53:37,780 --> 01:53:42,780
Yeah.
That's the way that I would have flown 

2278
01:53:42,780 --> 01:53:42,780
to her house.
If I was Ray Donovan,

2279
01:53:42,780 --> 01:53:44,270
I would have flown her fucking house and
I would say,

2280
01:53:44,271 --> 01:53:46,460
keep.
Here's more ambien.

2281
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:51,880
Here's more fucking malt liquor.
Just keep doing crazy shit until it's 

2282
01:53:53,061 --> 01:53:58,061
completely snowed over.
So that's the least of your problems.

2283
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:09,200
That's so true.
I think most of the people that are 

2284
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:12,191
tweeting all day are either don't have a
job and they're just addicted to twitter

2285
01:54:12,890 --> 01:54:17,890
or they're at work and they're just 
fucking off and it's supposed to be 

2286
01:54:17,890 --> 01:54:20,570
working and so this is way more engaging
to them because they're already stuck in

2287
01:54:20,571 --> 01:54:25,571
this office.
So they're making sport out of like 

2288
01:54:25,571 --> 01:54:27,560
going after people are getting at people
or communicating with people.

2289
01:54:27,561 --> 01:54:29,340
They're making sport out of it.
It,

2290
01:54:29,410 --> 01:54:34,410
it's,
it's flexing their intellectual muscles 

2291
01:54:34,410 --> 01:54:37,721
because they're trying to find a good 
argument to your point that makes you 

2292
01:54:37,721 --> 01:54:41,351
look fucking stupid.
Doing it in 280 words is fucking.

2293
01:54:41,790 --> 01:54:42,890
I asked.
I mean,

2294
01:54:42,891 --> 01:54:44,600
we've all done it.
Oh yeah.

2295
01:54:44,601 --> 01:54:47,000
I love,
I love twitter trolling,

2296
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:51,560
but when it's stupid,
just like fucking with people.

2297
01:54:51,770 --> 01:54:56,770
While you were trolling way back in the 
day when you were trolling in,

2298
01:54:58,150 --> 01:55:01,220
but you were trolling child molesters.

2299
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:02,050
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2300
01:55:02,070 --> 01:55:05,220
The AOL Instant Messenger.
Those days.

2301
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:06,690
Yeah.
That's the book.

2302
01:55:07,130 --> 01:55:12,130
I made a best of the book because 
honestly that was the funniest shit I've

2303
01:55:12,601 --> 01:55:14,100
ever written.
What year was,

2304
01:55:14,101 --> 01:55:19,101
this?
Was the late nineties when I did the 

2305
01:55:19,101 --> 01:55:23,061
aristocrats and they go,
you just make up the joke however you 

2306
01:55:23,061 --> 01:55:25,350
want it.
I just took like I took verbatim stuff.

2307
01:55:25,351 --> 01:55:29,040
I did baiting pedophiles,
Shit.

2308
01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:31,590
I'm doing fucking with them.
That's.

2309
01:55:31,860 --> 01:55:36,090
I almost forgot about you're baiting.
It was like you had a website,

2310
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:36,960
right?
It wasn't the way.

2311
01:55:36,961 --> 01:55:38,410
I had a website,
a website,

2312
01:55:38,411 --> 01:55:41,520
and they and they had stopped doing it 
because they got bored with it.

2313
01:55:41,521 --> 01:55:45,320
So it was.
Was painting the fence where it,

2314
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:47,100
Oh hey,
we'll get you to.

2315
01:55:47,370 --> 01:55:48,360
I asked them,
Hey,

2316
01:55:48,870 --> 01:55:50,880
can I do this and submit them to your 
site?

2317
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:54,450
I don't know how we had that much 
fucking time.

2318
01:55:54,451 --> 01:55:59,451
I would spend 14 hour days just trying 
to get a fucking full because he'd get 

2319
01:56:00,151 --> 01:56:05,151
one that went halfway through and the 
guy fails out because he figures out 

2320
01:56:05,151 --> 01:56:07,400
your fuck with them and it's not 
printable and like,

2321
01:56:07,470 --> 01:56:12,470
how did I have that much time?
I remember spending 12 hours on like 

2322
01:56:12,470 --> 01:56:16,230
free poker sites playing poker and then 
trolling the people because you have a,

2323
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:21,440
you know,
you can chat while you play poker and 

2324
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:22,250
then fucking with people and just being 
an asshole.

2325
01:56:22,260 --> 01:56:25,800
And how did I have 14 fucking because 
you didn't have a job.

2326
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:30,360
I still don't have a job and I still 
have probably that much free time,

2327
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:35,600
but now that I'm successful so I feel 
like I have to keep doing something 

2328
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:36,390
productive.

2329
01:56:37,090 --> 01:56:38,440
Well,
you're also wiser.

2330
01:56:38,940 --> 01:56:43,940
You realize like how much time you 
actually invented a invested into that 

2331
01:56:43,940 --> 01:56:45,380
versus what you got out of it,
you know,

2332
01:56:45,390 --> 01:56:50,390
I mean,
how many different pedophiles did you 

2333
01:56:50,390 --> 01:56:50,390
try to contact for?
One of them started talking to me.

2334
01:56:50,390 --> 01:56:52,450
Well,
you have to wait for them to contact you

2335
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:55,570
roast the point because you have your 
profile set up.

2336
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:58,930
I'm a 13 year old girl,
likes hot,

2337
01:56:59,480 --> 01:57:02,770
uh,
talk with older men.

2338
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:03,730
Oh,
you wrote that?

2339
01:57:04,450 --> 01:57:05,770
However you set it up.
I mean,

2340
01:57:05,771 --> 01:57:10,771
it's written cleverly so you're not 
getting another fucking 13 year old kids

2341
01:57:10,811 --> 01:57:13,240
talking to you.
And,

2342
01:57:13,241 --> 01:57:14,570
uh,
but,

2343
01:57:14,571 --> 01:57:19,571
uh,
just the amount of time to fucking off 

2344
01:57:19,571 --> 01:57:19,571
and having fun with it.

2345
01:57:19,571 --> 01:57:21,140
There was a funny story that I heard 
about a dea undercovered,

2346
01:57:21,141 --> 01:57:23,130
dea agent who,
uh,

2347
01:57:23,190 --> 01:57:28,190
moved in to try to arrest another 
undercovered dea agent and they playing 

2348
01:57:28,190 --> 01:57:32,511
each other back and forth against each 
other and they didn't know that both of 

2349
01:57:32,511 --> 01:57:34,590
them were cops the entire time.
You fucking assholes.

2350
01:57:35,130 --> 01:57:40,130
Just wasted money.
Just wasted money investigating each 

2351
01:57:40,130 --> 01:57:42,630
other.
So fucking stupid.

2352
01:57:42,990 --> 01:57:45,450
Both sides undercover.
Like,

2353
01:57:45,451 --> 01:57:47,430
what the fuck,
man,

2354
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:49,920
if,
if trump started talking about that,

2355
01:57:50,250 --> 01:57:51,600
if you really wanted to keep people 
around,

2356
01:57:52,410 --> 01:57:54,000
if you really wanted to get people on 
the side,

2357
01:57:54,120 --> 01:57:56,880
I think what he would do is start making
drugs legal and started saying,

2358
01:57:56,881 --> 01:58:01,881
listen folks,
there's a reason why it's a problem in 

2359
01:58:01,881 --> 01:58:03,501
Mexico.
And when you talk to real economists 

2360
01:58:03,501 --> 01:58:03,501
really were talking about that on stage 
last night.

2361
01:58:03,501 --> 01:58:04,070
Yeah,
yeah.

2362
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:06,810
The real problem is the drug war make 
drugs legal.

2363
01:58:07,350 --> 01:58:09,970
I wish I was thinking about that.
But uh,

2364
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:14,670
well,
first methods Alpha fucking.

2365
01:58:15,860 --> 01:58:18,840
It's just such a fucking horrible drug.
Ruthless.

2366
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:20,820
They make a lot of that in Mexico as 
well.

2367
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:22,980
Yeah,
it's a ruthless drug.

2368
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:28,040
It's a ruthless drug,
but I think part of the reason why it's 

2369
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:28,650
so fucked up is because all of it is 
illegal.

2370
01:58:29,130 --> 01:58:34,130
I mean,
that's a big part of why it's so fucked 

2371
01:58:34,130 --> 01:58:35,070
up is because it's not regulated.
It's not measured.

2372
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:38,700
It's the doses or not.
It doesn't say on the box what will kill

2373
01:58:38,701 --> 01:58:39,990
you.
You know?

2374
01:58:39,991 --> 01:58:44,620
You can go and bought this old camp 
whiskey at any corner store.

2375
01:58:44,621 --> 01:58:46,070
Right?
You just go in there and buy it.

2376
01:58:46,210 --> 01:58:47,140
Drake,
that whole thing,

2377
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:49,060
drink that whole thing.
If you weigh 100 pounds,

2378
01:58:49,061 --> 01:58:50,740
you're dead.
You're dead.

2379
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:54,280
We all know is thinking about that.
If I did run for mayor,

2380
01:58:54,281 --> 01:58:54,830
I have a.

2381
01:58:54,870 --> 01:58:59,870
a,
a like they have the gun exchange 

2382
01:58:59,870 --> 01:58:59,870
programs.
You have a method change.

2383
01:58:59,870 --> 01:59:02,710
Is it Meth for mushrooms?
Ooh,

2384
01:59:02,770 --> 01:59:04,780
that's a great exchange.
Give them good drugs.

2385
01:59:04,781 --> 01:59:09,781
They're there.
They're doing this because it's cheap 

2386
01:59:09,781 --> 01:59:10,030
and available.
We'll get get them on good drugs.

2387
01:59:10,180 --> 01:59:15,180
That's.
That's actually a really good way to 

2388
01:59:15,180 --> 01:59:17,161
approach the subject.
It wasn't one of the things that hunter 

2389
01:59:17,161 --> 01:59:20,071
s Thompson said,
what he's running for sheriff a Pitkin 

2390
01:59:20,071 --> 01:59:20,071
County.
He said,

2391
01:59:20,071 --> 01:59:20,290
uh,
any drug worth taking,

2392
01:59:20,291 --> 01:59:22,750
she'll never be sold and we'll,
uh,

2393
01:59:22,780 --> 01:59:27,780
put a stocks in the middle of the seat 
in the middle of the city to lock up 

2394
01:59:27,780 --> 01:59:29,620
dishonest drug dealers.
Drug should be free.

2395
01:59:30,550 --> 01:59:34,300
We're going to arrest drug dealers.
I think if we made everything legal,

2396
01:59:34,390 --> 01:59:37,660
we'd have real problems for sure for 
quite a long period of time.

2397
01:59:38,050 --> 01:59:43,050
The question is whether or not you have 
enough resources to parent your kids to 

2398
01:59:43,050 --> 01:59:44,500
keep those problems from happening to 
your family,

2399
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:49,680
whether or not you have enough self 
control to keep yourself from being one 

2400
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:51,010
of those problems and drugs become legal
and accessible,

2401
01:59:51,220 --> 01:59:54,880
but then once it settled down from there
forward,

2402
01:59:54,881 --> 01:59:58,300
we'd be moving in a way,
healthier place and you essentially take

2403
01:59:58,360 --> 02:00:00,580
all of the money out of the cartel.

2404
02:00:00,580 --> 02:00:05,580
They're not making any money anymore and
then they're not going to be this 

2405
02:00:05,580 --> 02:00:08,401
murderers gang of us.
It's gonna take a while for things to 

2406
02:00:08,401 --> 02:00:08,410
dissipate,
but look what they did to Columbia.

2407
02:00:08,650 --> 02:00:13,650
I mean,
Columbia used to be fucking crazy and 

2408
02:00:13,650 --> 02:00:14,080
now you can go there and it's supposed 
to be really nice.

2409
02:00:14,470 --> 02:00:16,720
You go to Bogota.
It's supposed to be a really nice place.

2410
02:00:16,721 --> 02:00:17,920
It's,
it's safe.

2411
02:00:17,980 --> 02:00:20,380
I want to go to South America and I 
can't.

2412
02:00:20,410 --> 02:00:22,300
I mean,
South America,

2413
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:24,790
it's the only continent I haven't been 
to.

2414
02:00:25,310 --> 02:00:27,430
Antarctica doesn't count.
But uh,

2415
02:00:28,420 --> 02:00:31,180
if there's nothing,
I've never found a place that looks like

2416
02:00:31,181 --> 02:00:33,340
I want to go with Argentina looks bad 
ass.

2417
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:34,420
Really?
Yeah.

2418
02:00:34,930 --> 02:00:38,440
That's a Argentina's near the glacier.
It's fucking beautiful down there.

2419
02:00:39,220 --> 02:00:41,800
Yeah.
No roads talks highly about it,

2420
02:00:41,801 --> 02:00:43,930
but he's Argentinian.
Busy.

2421
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:45,460
His,
some of his.

2422
02:00:45,850 --> 02:00:50,850
He's got family down there and yeah,
look,

2423
02:00:51,101 --> 02:00:54,880
there's some fucking beautiful spots,
beautiful spots in this country and this

2424
02:00:54,881 --> 02:00:55,420
world.

2425
02:00:56,410 --> 02:00:58,270
But uh,
South America,

2426
02:00:58,900 --> 02:01:03,900
South America.
The weirdest thing is like how much 

2427
02:01:03,900 --> 02:01:06,871
jungle it is.
Like you look at how much of like 

2428
02:01:06,871 --> 02:01:09,910
Bolivia and Brazil,
how much of it is actual jungle,

2429
02:01:10,110 --> 02:01:11,650
you know,
like Holy Shit,

2430
02:01:12,090 --> 02:01:13,210
like,
no wonder why these people don't.

2431
02:01:13,330 --> 02:01:18,330
Most every one of them has some kind of 
fucking rebel army shit going on and 

2432
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:23,880
kidnapping.
It was nothing that seemed safe like 

2433
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:23,880
Costa Rica,
you know,

2434
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:26,020
you're probably not going to have a lot 
of issues.

2435
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:26,800
Right,
right,

2436
02:01:26,801 --> 02:01:29,680
right.
But everything I've looked up,

2437
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:33,700
I was on the beach in Costa Rica with my
kid and some dude offered me coke.

2438
02:01:35,810 --> 02:01:40,280
I was walking,
holding hands with a five year old dude

2439
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:43,130
was offered me coke.
My guy had not right now.

2440
02:01:43,970 --> 02:01:46,020
Not right now.
It's just like that.

2441
02:01:46,030 --> 02:01:47,570
Just get you whatever you want.
Gringo,

2442
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:49,370
you know,
he come down here to party,

2443
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:50,420
you know,
I know you don't live here,

2444
02:01:50,421 --> 02:01:52,640
motherfucker.
Who come here for a good time?

2445
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:55,460
Where'd you go?
Um,

2446
02:01:55,461 --> 02:01:56,360
I don't remember,
man.

2447
02:01:56,361 --> 02:01:58,300
It was a couple of years ago.
But uh,

2448
02:01:58,330 --> 02:02:01,160
we,
we drove to a couple of different places

2449
02:02:01,161 --> 02:02:06,161
in Costa Rica.
Where did you fly into San Jose or 

2450
02:02:06,161 --> 02:02:06,161
Liberia?
Liberia.

2451
02:02:06,161 --> 02:02:09,020
Right.
And then we went to the rain forest.

2452
02:02:09,060 --> 02:02:11,780
Did the ziplining did I heard a horrible
thing?

2453
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:15,340
I think it was just the honeymoon.
Couple of Tan.

2454
02:02:15,560 --> 02:02:20,560
Yeah.
They crashed into each other and killed 

2455
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:23,321
the guy and put the girl in a coma.
They crashed into each other on a zip 

2456
02:02:23,321 --> 02:02:23,321
line.
Yeah.

2457
02:02:23,321 --> 02:02:25,490
So the one of them get stuck.
Yeah,

2458
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:30,520
and the other guys coming down,
it's like it's like a fat kid into 

2459
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:33,440
fucking a water slide gets stuck in the 
tube,

2460
02:02:33,441 --> 02:02:38,441
but then the next one comes down and 
smashes and they were going so fast to 

2461
02:02:38,441 --> 02:02:38,441
men.

2462
02:02:38,441 --> 02:02:41,090
You're going so fast,
you're on the zip line.

2463
02:02:41,091 --> 02:02:43,190
You're flying.
I did.

2464
02:02:43,400 --> 02:02:47,840
I did that once just to say I did 
something the first time I went to Costa

2465
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:48,380
Rica.
Yeah,

2466
02:02:48,410 --> 02:02:49,670
that's enough.
After that,

2467
02:02:49,900 --> 02:02:52,730
I'm happy.
Fat on a Boogie Board.

2468
02:02:53,210 --> 02:02:55,100
Yeah.
I did it once too and I kept thinking,

2469
02:02:55,250 --> 02:02:58,400
when do they check this wire?
This wire as a mile long,

2470
02:02:58,610 --> 02:03:01,730
how are they checking?
This wire is not as strong.

2471
02:03:01,731 --> 02:03:06,731
Work Ethic and Costa Rica either know 
those dudes who worked there who were 

2472
02:03:06,731 --> 02:03:11,631
just climbing up and hitch and people 
onto those things like they're a little 

2473
02:03:11,631 --> 02:03:15,821
too comfortable with the edge.
Those people are just a little too 

2474
02:03:15,821 --> 02:03:19,100
comfortable with hanging off the trees 
clip and ropes on the wires and shooting

2475
02:03:19,101 --> 02:03:23,870
it down a little too casual.
Little too casual about that endeavor.

2476
02:03:24,710 --> 02:03:29,710
Yeah.
One of the scariest things I've ever 

2477
02:03:29,710 --> 02:03:32,621
done is the cab ride from Hako to San 
Jose in the capital and they're fucking 

2478
02:03:34,491 --> 02:03:38,540
speeding around what should be like 15 
mile an hour curves and there's a,

2479
02:03:38,830 --> 02:03:43,830
you know,
an ox and a cart in the fucking middle 

2480
02:03:43,830 --> 02:03:45,750
of the road and you just had a 
collegiate coming down.

2481
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:52,240
So one of the things that I used to 
always be fascinated by bourdain's show 

2482
02:03:52,240 --> 02:03:54,620
was his willingness to continue to go to
these places where you had to take these

2483
02:03:55,100 --> 02:04:00,100
trucks down,
these dirt roads and you look out the 

2484
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:00,320
window and you see a sheer cliff and up 
ahead.

2485
02:04:00,321 --> 02:04:05,321
There's a fucking landslide.
Now they get to bring in a tractor to 

2486
02:04:05,321 --> 02:04:05,980
move the rocks away for landslide.
Like,

2487
02:04:06,830 --> 02:04:09,760
Oh Dude,
David Vietnam where you're,

2488
02:04:09,910 --> 02:04:14,910
you're,
you're in the cab from the airport and 

2489
02:04:14,910 --> 02:04:17,831
there's just see like a Sturgis of 
Vietnamese people.

2490
02:04:18,680 --> 02:04:22,340
They're all on this,
this sea of motorcycles and scooters.

2491
02:04:22,670 --> 02:04:27,620
And like,
you're literally moving in your seat,

2492
02:04:27,621 --> 02:04:31,280
like they're going to hit it and somehow
it works.

2493
02:04:31,281 --> 02:04:36,010
Like Cirque de Solei that crash,
but they don't crash it.

2494
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:38,160
Those birds in the sky moved together.
Yeah.

2495
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:40,950
That's how they figured that out.
How to all of them to get together.

2496
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:44,530
Look at all these people.
Yeah.

2497
02:04:45,220 --> 02:04:50,050
This is insanity.
That is just straight and Saturday.

2498
02:04:50,730 --> 02:04:52,740
Three lights or anything.
There's nothing there.

2499
02:04:52,970 --> 02:04:55,330
Cars are just driving through.
Have you ever been in Mexico City?

2500
02:04:55,450 --> 02:05:00,450
Might even be.
That might be the view from where I was 

2501
02:05:00,450 --> 02:05:03,821
staying.
I was staying in the hotel where they 

2502
02:05:04,061 --> 02:05:06,230
have the iconic picture of the,
uh,

2503
02:05:06,590 --> 02:05:08,750
the last helicopter,
CIA,

2504
02:05:08,751 --> 02:05:13,751
helicopter landing,
taking off from the roof of the hotel 

2505
02:05:13,751 --> 02:05:17,861
and people are like climbing to be the 
last person on there.

2506
02:05:18,140 --> 02:05:20,930
That was the hotel we were at that.
Whoa.

2507
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:24,590
Where that helicopter was landing is now
a rooftop bar.

2508
02:05:25,160 --> 02:05:27,920
Wow.
And that was the hotel we did the Gig in

2509
02:05:28,610 --> 02:05:30,020
Vietnam.
Supposed to be awesome.

2510
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:33,620
No.
If you're adventurous,

2511
02:05:33,621 --> 02:05:36,550
if you're Tom Rhodes,
I'm sure it's fantastic if you're,

2512
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:39,470
where you're terrified to go out of the 
hotel.

2513
02:05:39,710 --> 02:05:40,850
No,
no,

2514
02:05:40,851 --> 02:05:42,640
not at all.
That rooftop bars.

2515
02:05:42,710 --> 02:05:44,180
Great for Dane.
Loved it.

2516
02:05:44,181 --> 02:05:46,190
It was like one of his favorite places 
to go eat.

2517
02:05:46,270 --> 02:05:47,540
He loved Vo.
That's where he,

2518
02:05:47,541 --> 02:05:48,320
uh,
he had,

2519
02:05:48,321 --> 02:05:51,380
uh,
eight with the president.

2520
02:05:51,620 --> 02:05:52,760
Yeah.
Obama.

2521
02:05:52,820 --> 02:05:54,630
That's right.
They may still call it the

2522
02:05:54,680 --> 02:05:55,990
president,
the president.

2523
02:05:56,260 --> 02:05:59,770
He's my president.
He was my president.

2524
02:05:59,980 --> 02:06:02,170
Did you see when the NBC wrote out about
Oprah,

2525
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:07,320
here's to our president,
it was an amazing speech by our 

2526
02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:07,720
president.
They put an NBC,

2527
02:06:07,721 --> 02:06:10,630
put it on their twitter page and then 
someone came along and went,

2528
02:06:10,631 --> 02:06:12,310
what the fuck are you doing?

2529
02:06:14,490 --> 02:06:15,860
I love when people say,
well,

2530
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:21,500
what do you.
When you complain about something and 

2531
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:21,500
they go,
yeah,

2532
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:25,811
well,
Obama did the same thing and no one 

2533
02:06:25,811 --> 02:06:25,811
shedding.
I wasn't.

2534
02:06:25,811 --> 02:06:25,811
No,
I didn't.

2535
02:06:25,820 --> 02:06:27,190
I didn't know.
And uh,

2536
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:32,200
that's not the point still sucks you 
when you make a point about an issue 

2537
02:06:33,051 --> 02:06:38,051
that it's a left or right thing while 
you were actually defending a person or 

2538
02:06:38,971 --> 02:06:40,220
a like,
no,

2539
02:06:40,221 --> 02:06:42,950
this is fucked up and wrong.
Will Obama did it?

2540
02:06:43,070 --> 02:06:44,960
Well,
there's still fucked up and wrong.

2541
02:06:45,260 --> 02:06:46,400
I never,
I like,

2542
02:06:46,490 --> 02:06:51,200
I think Obama's a really fucking cool 
guy as a personality,

2543
02:06:51,380 --> 02:06:53,160
but I'm sure every print.
Yeah,

2544
02:06:53,210 --> 02:06:56,900
Bill Clinton did horrible fucking things
and Yo,

2545
02:06:56,901 --> 02:07:01,901
uh,
like increased sentencing from fucking 

2546
02:07:01,901 --> 02:07:01,901
drug stuff and what?
Yeah,

2547
02:07:01,901 --> 02:07:03,950
but he was a good personality and I 
don't give a fuck.

2548
02:07:05,060 --> 02:07:06,620
I don't imagine

2549
02:07:07,010 --> 02:07:12,010
a guy or girl that's supposed to be 
paying attention to every single issue 

2550
02:07:12,010 --> 02:07:16,511
that's going on in this country and 
making decisions about all of it and 

2551
02:07:16,511 --> 02:07:19,541
doing it all,
investigating every single issue 

2552
02:07:19,541 --> 02:07:22,331
perfectly.
Getting all the right advice from all 

2553
02:07:22,331 --> 02:07:25,280
the advisors carefully considering each 
and every step the fuck out of here.

2554
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:30,400
There's no way they can.
There's no way the president really 

2555
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:31,370
knows what's going on with all the 
different problems in this country.

2556
02:07:31,400 --> 02:07:32,420
There's no fucking way

2557
02:07:32,980 --> 02:07:37,660
possible if,
if we just became a,

2558
02:07:37,820 --> 02:07:42,820
a cool country like Norway and just 
close all the bases around the world.

2559
02:07:46,541 --> 02:07:51,541
Don't be world police.
We're just gonna be a fun country like 

2560
02:07:51,541 --> 02:07:54,871
fucking Iceland.
I just bring all the troops back and no 

2561
02:07:54,871 --> 02:07:58,351
more.
Go ahead with the were disarming you 

2562
02:07:58,391 --> 02:08:02,290
guys.
I think shit would calm down.

2563
02:08:02,680 --> 02:08:04,720
I think the world would calm down

2564
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:10,280
as long as we kept our guns,
as long as they keep our weapons and 

2565
02:08:11,671 --> 02:08:13,620
keep the same amount of people in the 
military,

2566
02:08:13,621 --> 02:08:18,621
bring them back home,
but make them exercise here at the 

2567
02:08:18,621 --> 02:08:22,080
problem is as soon as any one superpower
drifts away,

2568
02:08:22,081 --> 02:08:25,230
they leave a vacuum and another super 
power try to rise up.

2569
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:30,800
That's the big fear.
That's what the big military proponents 

2570
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:34,040
fear is that if we're not strong,
someone else will become stronger and 

2571
02:08:34,040 --> 02:08:36,410
then we'll be weak,
will be attacked and that it does happen

2572
02:08:36,440 --> 02:08:41,440
other places in the world and we can't 
be so naive as to think it'll never 

2573
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:41,440
happen again.

2574
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:43,550
So give it a shot and if it doesn't work
out,

2575
02:08:43,551 --> 02:08:48,551
fuck it.
I don't know how you can take any 

2576
02:08:49,431 --> 02:08:54,431
president seriously now as we're aging 
and put time and perspective for years 

2577
02:08:56,061 --> 02:08:59,030
is nothing,
so I'm going to make a deal with you.

2578
02:08:59,240 --> 02:09:02,350
Have four years later is going to be 
another asshole goes,

2579
02:09:02,351 --> 02:09:03,290
Nah,
nevermind.

2580
02:09:03,600 --> 02:09:06,170
Scrap that.
I think there's a ticket.

2581
02:09:06,171 --> 02:09:09,320
Dictators not a bad thing,
as long as he's a good one.

2582
02:09:09,740 --> 02:09:11,330
Yeah,
you've done evolent dictator.

2583
02:09:11,331 --> 02:09:16,130
That's like a monk dictate.
We all have a good time.

2584
02:09:17,130 --> 02:09:20,210
Fucking 15 hour work week.
Well,

2585
02:09:20,211 --> 02:09:20,600
here's the

2586
02:09:20,840 --> 02:09:24,890
question in the United States was 
founded because people have decided they

2587
02:09:24,891 --> 02:09:26,720
didn't like the way things are running 
in Europe.

2588
02:09:26,721 --> 02:09:29,690
They didn't like monarchies.
They didn't like being under the rule of

2589
02:09:29,691 --> 02:09:34,691
the king or queen.
They wanted to do it by elected 

2590
02:09:34,691 --> 02:09:36,971
officials that wanted to have a 
representative democracy or a 

2591
02:09:36,971 --> 02:09:38,260
representative,
democratic republic.

2592
02:09:38,261 --> 02:09:40,820
They wanted to figure out something new.
So they came over here and did it.

2593
02:09:41,150 --> 02:09:46,150
What would be the resistance?
What if say like everybody tried to do 

2594
02:09:46,150 --> 02:09:50,840
what they did up in Oregon and start a 
new country somewhere and people like,

2595
02:09:50,841 --> 02:09:53,090
fuck this.
We're going to go to this spot.

2596
02:09:53,091 --> 02:09:55,460
Look,
global warming is clearing off some nice

2597
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:57,410
swatches,
a land in Antarctica.

2598
02:09:57,620 --> 02:10:00,620
We're just gonna move up there.
It's fucking beautiful and green.

2599
02:10:01,020 --> 02:10:02,240
Just fuck it.
We're done.

2600
02:10:02,270 --> 02:10:07,270
We're done.
And then over there we're going to 

2601
02:10:07,270 --> 02:10:07,270
barely have an army.
And uh,

2602
02:10:07,270 --> 02:10:08,090
you know,
just have a bunch of dudes.

2603
02:10:08,091 --> 02:10:10,880
Look on the lookout with guns,
make sure we don't get robbed.

2604
02:10:11,060 --> 02:10:12,350
And that's it.
And you know,

2605
02:10:12,440 --> 02:10:13,400
healthcare.
Yeah,

2606
02:10:13,401 --> 02:10:15,740
we'll pay for that education today.
Yeah,

2607
02:10:15,741 --> 02:10:17,360
we'll pay for education.
Yeah,

2608
02:10:17,361 --> 02:10:18,260
do whatever you want to do

2609
02:10:19,350 --> 02:10:22,160
pile then fucking kids and ruin it.
Damn,

2610
02:10:22,870 --> 02:10:23,680
that's the problem.
Right?

2611
02:10:23,720 --> 02:10:28,720
Overpopulation,
but how long would it take to 

2612
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:28,720
overpopulate greenland?
Well,

2613
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:29,290
that's what they were trying to do.
Yeah,

2614
02:10:29,350 --> 02:10:32,890
I looked into greenland is a weird place
to go visit.

2615
02:10:33,050 --> 02:10:34,700
Iceland is fantastic.

2616
02:10:34,730 --> 02:10:37,940
It's just the little dull.
That's the problem with all these.

2617
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:43,120
The best place to live is Norway and 
Scandinavia and Iceland,

2618
02:10:43,701 --> 02:10:47,530
but there is a.
it's Kinda there.

2619
02:10:47,540 --> 02:10:52,540
Everyone's nice.
It's like going up fucking northern 

2620
02:10:52,540 --> 02:10:53,540
Minnesota and everyone's niceness 
though.

2621
02:10:53,780 --> 02:10:55,220
There's no excitement.
There's no.

2622
02:10:55,940 --> 02:11:00,940
A buddy of mine that's just adrenaline.
Montana said he was living in Bozeman 

2623
02:11:00,940 --> 02:11:01,730
and I said,
you didn't love Boseman.

2624
02:11:01,731 --> 02:11:06,731
He says like,
it's all a bunch of boring white people 

2625
02:11:06,731 --> 02:11:06,731
that just.
They're really into bikes.

2626
02:11:06,731 --> 02:11:07,000
Yeah,
really into biking.

2627
02:11:07,610 --> 02:11:10,600
Great calves.
That's what he said.

2628
02:11:11,730 --> 02:11:13,460
Dance.
Boring white people.

2629
02:11:16,850 --> 02:11:19,250
But I mean,
that's one of the good things about what

2630
02:11:19,251 --> 02:11:23,720
you do is that you can be in your town 
and then you can go other places,

2631
02:11:24,050 --> 02:11:27,260
but you always have that town versus if 
you get stuck.

2632
02:11:27,530 --> 02:11:29,900
Like we were talking about people that 
are just living in Columbus,

2633
02:11:29,901 --> 02:11:30,740
Ohio,
their whole life.

2634
02:11:30,740 --> 02:11:33,020
Not to pick on Columbus,
but near St Louis,

2635
02:11:33,021 --> 02:11:37,610
whatever name is city versus someone who
travels around all over the place.

2636
02:11:37,611 --> 02:11:39,470
The same can be said about someone who 
lives in La.

2637
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:42,800
If you grow up here and you think this 
is the world of this,

2638
02:11:42,801 --> 02:11:47,801
this crazy congested slab of human rose 
piled on top of each other.

2639
02:11:49,770 --> 02:11:54,770
Now the rest of the world is.
There's some spots where you can go to 

2640
02:11:54,770 --> 02:11:54,890
where there's hardly anybody.
You ever been to Idaho?

2641
02:11:55,600 --> 02:11:56,600
Boise,
Idaho.

2642
02:11:56,660 --> 02:11:57,560
Did you?
Yeah.

2643
02:11:57,561 --> 02:12:01,580
I lived in a town of 400 people for 
Awhile when I was 22.

2644
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:02,930
No Shit.
Yeah,

2645
02:12:03,080 --> 02:12:06,020
a little cabin on the south fork of the 
payette river,

2646
02:12:06,170 --> 02:12:11,170
about 55 miles north of Boise.
There's some lakes up there where you 

2647
02:12:11,841 --> 02:12:13,730
go,
I shouldn't even be allowed to be here.

2648
02:12:14,230 --> 02:12:15,350
Like,
this is too pretty,

2649
02:12:15,620 --> 02:12:20,620
like this seems like you should have to 
pay to be here or this should be 

2650
02:12:20,620 --> 02:12:20,930
restricted access or something.

2651
02:12:21,470 --> 02:12:23,970
Like it's fucking gorgeous up there.
I,

2652
02:12:24,010 --> 02:12:26,360
I was,
I was 22 and I,

2653
02:12:26,690 --> 02:12:29,600
my wife left me,
I moved to Boise just because it sounded

2654
02:12:29,601 --> 02:12:32,270
funny.
Fraud,

2655
02:12:32,271 --> 02:12:34,160
telemarketing.
So I could do it anywhere.

2656
02:12:34,161 --> 02:12:35,370
There's a phone,
right?

2657
02:12:35,371 --> 02:12:37,230
I'm in business.
And then uh,

2658
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:41,990
after we moved to Boise and immediately 
my wife left me for my best friend.

2659
02:12:41,991 --> 02:12:46,991
We all moved out there together and then
my other buddy that moved with us 

2660
02:12:46,991 --> 02:12:49,190
couldn't handle the stress so he went 
back to Vegas.

2661
02:12:49,310 --> 02:12:53,360
So I'm all my shit to boise and within 
two weeks I'm alone.

2662
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:56,660
So I moved up to this fucking.
I bought a cabin,

2663
02:12:56,661 --> 02:13:01,050
like a for sale by owner.
Like,

2664
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:03,440
like I didn't get a loan.
I was like,

2665
02:13:03,441 --> 02:13:05,160
Hey,
I'm just going to give you was,

2666
02:13:05,780 --> 02:13:10,780
what do you call it?
We're just signed a contract and I'll 

2667
02:13:10,821 --> 02:13:13,240
pay you.
I didn't go through a bank owner,

2668
02:13:13,250 --> 02:13:18,250
financed owner finance and a little 
cabin and the two bars in town.

2669
02:13:19,761 --> 02:13:24,761
And you were either a long branch guy or
you're the dirty shame guy and I was a 

2670
02:13:24,761 --> 02:13:29,141
dirty shame saloon guy and I would drive
back and forth because in a small town 

2671
02:13:29,421 --> 02:13:31,980
they open around noon but

2672
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:34,920
not necessarily at Niu.
And how old were you then?

2673
02:13:35,010 --> 02:13:36,510
Twenty two.
That's hilarious.

2674
02:13:36,570 --> 02:13:41,570
No fucking chicks there.
So you would drive back and forth in 

2675
02:13:41,570 --> 02:13:43,860
front of the bar until Jolie showed up 
to open.

2676
02:13:43,861 --> 02:13:47,820
So it's 1215.
I've been just driving back and forth,

2677
02:13:47,821 --> 02:13:52,821
waiting for it to open and I would have.
I lasted like six months and then I had 

2678
02:13:52,821 --> 02:13:54,320
to ditch out on the front.
You there by yourself?

2679
02:13:54,321 --> 02:13:55,830
Owner financing?
Yeah,

2680
02:13:55,831 --> 02:14:00,831
at one point my buddy that moved back to
vegas came up and he was there for a 

2681
02:14:00,831 --> 02:14:03,600
couple months,
but we'd get on the phone just enough to

2682
02:14:04,080 --> 02:14:05,940
pay our bar tab.
In fact,

2683
02:14:05,941 --> 02:14:09,300
my bar tab,
I traded out like furniture when I.

2684
02:14:09,540 --> 02:14:14,540
When I bailed six months later I traded 
jolene like my furniture in the cabin 

2685
02:14:14,881 --> 02:14:17,580
for my bar tab.
And yeah,

2686
02:14:17,780 --> 02:14:22,780
it was fucking crazy.
So you could set your own hours when 

2687
02:14:22,780 --> 02:14:22,780
you're doing that.

2688
02:14:22,780 --> 02:14:22,780
Scam.
Telemarketing stuff,

2689
02:14:22,780 --> 02:14:26,340
he just did it whenever you wanted to 
and they just got you clocked in.

2690
02:14:26,370 --> 02:14:30,840
You got paid out of my cabin was just 
pick up the phone.

2691
02:14:30,841 --> 02:14:33,500
I had leads I stole from Vegas.
And,

2692
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:36,450
and what did you do?
Like how did that work?

2693
02:14:36,930 --> 02:14:41,930
I'd call up businesses and then add the 
pitch and you won one of these awards 

2694
02:14:41,930 --> 02:14:46,341
and you just have to buy this many pens 
like ad copy and ad specs,

2695
02:14:47,640 --> 02:14:51,340
advertising specialties.
This mug with A.

2696
02:14:51,340 --> 02:14:51,880
Hey Joe,
uh,

2697
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:54,470
uh,
you won a big award and I'm going to.

2698
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:59,720
All you have to do is make a small 
purchase of these mugs with your 

2699
02:14:59,720 --> 02:15:01,080
business name on them,
the Joe Rogan podcast,

2700
02:15:01,081 --> 02:15:02,880
and you're guaranteed to win this big 
award.

2701
02:15:02,881 --> 02:15:05,580
That's worth way.
Wow.

2702
02:15:05,581 --> 02:15:07,680
So it was just a total scam.
Yeah.

2703
02:15:08,070 --> 02:15:11,550
Wow.
But cleverly phrased,

2704
02:15:11,551 --> 02:15:16,320
so to stay in that gray area of legal 
were like,

2705
02:15:16,350 --> 02:15:17,910
whoa.
I knew a dude who has

2706
02:15:18,220 --> 02:15:23,220
really interesting scam.
He had a scam where they were making a.

2707
02:15:24,150 --> 02:15:28,500
It was a company that would allow you to
fix your credit.

2708
02:15:28,710 --> 02:15:32,700
So they would give you a line of credit 
and a,

2709
02:15:32,730 --> 02:15:37,730
you would buy things and then pay off 
the credit and it would boost your 

2710
02:15:38,341 --> 02:15:40,140
credit backs if you had fucked up 
credit.

2711
02:15:40,320 --> 02:15:42,390
It was,
it was allowing you to fix your credit.

2712
02:15:42,391 --> 02:15:46,410
But the catch was the only things that 
you could buy with their credit card was

2713
02:15:46,411 --> 02:15:48,350
things from their catalog.
So

2714
02:15:48,670 --> 02:15:51,490
a soul to the company's story.
I,

2715
02:15:51,600 --> 02:15:52,550
you know,
those things.

2716
02:15:52,610 --> 02:15:54,360
So they had these catalogs scam

2717
02:15:56,240 --> 02:15:59,000
stuff,
but say if something costs,

2718
02:15:59,040 --> 02:15:59,500
uh,
you know,

2719
02:15:59,510 --> 02:16:04,510
whatever it was,
a toenail clipper for costs like $3 at 

2720
02:16:04,510 --> 02:16:07,511
the grocery store there is $25.
So if you want to buy it,

2721
02:16:07,700 --> 02:16:08,240
you're,
you're,

2722
02:16:08,241 --> 02:16:10,610
you're giving them a giant chunk of 
profit.

2723
02:16:10,730 --> 02:16:15,730
So they would ship these terrible little
items and it would really actually boost

2724
02:16:16,081 --> 02:16:18,470
these people's credit.
It actually did work were.

2725
02:16:18,770 --> 02:16:21,170
So it was enough that it was a total 
scam.

2726
02:16:21,380 --> 02:16:26,380
So you're the only shit they can buy 
with your credit cards and stuff from 

2727
02:16:26,380 --> 02:16:28,130
your catalog and everything's marked up 
through the fucking roof.

2728
02:16:28,610 --> 02:16:30,190
And this made millions

2729
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:31,910
on that.
Made millions.

2730
02:16:32,380 --> 02:16:37,380
What aspects of the products,
like what I was working for a company 

2731
02:16:37,421 --> 02:16:40,520
originally we would have the uh,
the uh,

2732
02:16:40,800 --> 02:16:45,800
a black mat,
a pen with the gold medal Florentine 

2733
02:16:46,300 --> 02:16:51,300
Trim and five lines of your ad copy on 
it and we'd be selling these fucking 

2734
02:16:51,300 --> 02:16:53,950
twenty five cent pens for like $4 a 
piece.

2735
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:59,880
So it was put the scan that I was just 
getting into when I started doing comedy

2736
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:05,110
and then bailed out and went full time.
And comedy was the uh,

2737
02:17:05,140 --> 02:17:07,390
the invention once,
like the George Foreman.

2738
02:17:08,080 --> 02:17:09,370
Oh look the grill.
Yeah.

2739
02:17:09,940 --> 02:17:13,270
Do you have an invention?
And it's a fucking.

2740
02:17:13,430 --> 02:17:17,230
It's just such a great scam because egos
involved and it's good.

2741
02:17:17,490 --> 02:17:22,490
You know,
everyone thinks they should be on shark 

2742
02:17:22,490 --> 02:17:22,490
tank.
Those kind of people.

2743
02:17:22,490 --> 02:17:23,170
And you go,
I can't say,

2744
02:17:23,780 --> 02:17:28,780
but I think what you have here and that.
And then it's a multilevel where vent 

2745
02:17:29,891 --> 02:17:30,310
help.

2746
02:17:30,340 --> 02:17:33,160
There it is.
Submit your invention idea to companies.

2747
02:17:33,220 --> 02:17:38,220
I'm not saying invent help is a scam.
I'm saying scams of that.

2748
02:17:38,710 --> 02:17:43,710
Do you have an invention?
And then there's a step one is we're 

2749
02:17:43,710 --> 02:17:44,280
going to do a,
like a,

2750
02:17:44,420 --> 02:17:48,520
a patent,
a research to see,

2751
02:17:48,521 --> 02:17:51,690
and this is going to cost you this,
but honestly Phil,

2752
02:17:52,750 --> 02:17:57,750
I think you're onto something.
I can't say that this is a million 

2753
02:17:57,750 --> 02:18:01,600
dollar idea,
but I know when I have a feeling the way

2754
02:18:01,601 --> 02:18:06,601
you say it and you could see like it 
would be so easy and I was just starting

2755
02:18:07,451 --> 02:18:12,451
to do that.
Did you feel awful when you get off the 

2756
02:18:12,451 --> 02:18:12,451
phone?
No,

2757
02:18:12,451 --> 02:18:15,880
not.
I didn't feel awful till years later.

2758
02:18:16,520 --> 02:18:21,520
While I never did get into that fully 
where I was just starting to do that out

2759
02:18:23,021 --> 02:18:28,021
of my house,
out of my apartment in Vegas when I 

2760
02:18:28,021 --> 02:18:28,021
like,
I'm going full time and comedy.

2761
02:18:28,021 --> 02:18:30,010
So I.
But the other scams,

2762
02:18:30,100 --> 02:18:33,120
no,
I never felt bad because you were.

2763
02:18:33,520 --> 02:18:35,710
They say,
oh they're ripping off old people.

2764
02:18:35,711 --> 02:18:38,350
No,
we were ripping off young greedy fucking

2765
02:18:38,351 --> 02:18:41,140
people that think they're going to 
fucking get something for nothing.

2766
02:18:41,500 --> 02:18:45,120
And a business.
Small business thing work.

2767
02:18:45,130 --> 02:18:46,990
Like what if someone did have a good 
invention?

2768
02:18:47,740 --> 02:18:49,720
I don't know.
I never got that far into it.

2769
02:18:49,721 --> 02:18:51,850
I was just starting where I go,
fuck this.

2770
02:18:51,851 --> 02:18:53,740
I don't have time.
I'm doing comedy.

2771
02:18:53,741 --> 02:18:55,600
I got to.
I got an offer.

2772
02:18:55,601 --> 02:19:00,280
I moved to Phoenix and I got a job as a 
house Mc six,

2773
02:19:00,670 --> 02:19:01,900
six months?
Yeah,

2774
02:19:01,901 --> 02:19:06,901
about six months after I started I fell 
in love with a girl and Phoenix moved 

2775
02:19:06,971 --> 02:19:10,960
down there,
got a job as a house mc in a where I all

2776
02:19:10,961 --> 02:19:13,090
I was getting.
I was getting a free hotel room.

2777
02:19:13,091 --> 02:19:16,420
The club was in a a days inn I think it 
was,

2778
02:19:16,640 --> 02:19:20,680
so I'll get a free hotel so I had a 
place to live and I could do comedy five

2779
02:19:20,681 --> 02:19:25,681
nights a week and talk to the Gig chef 
loved me and would give me free food.

2780
02:19:28,700 --> 02:19:31,810
You do shows in Bisbee now?
I,

2781
02:19:32,500 --> 02:19:36,050
I have other people come to Bisbee.
I filmed my last.

2782
02:19:36,230 --> 02:19:41,230
It's a throwaway special,
but I just did it like as an experiment 

2783
02:19:41,230 --> 02:19:45,310
in the fun house.
So basically this room but not maybe not

2784
02:19:46,551 --> 02:19:51,551
quite this big.
It's an 18 by 20 box with a bar built 

2785
02:19:51,551 --> 02:19:54,290
and a little tiny stage in the corner 
and I've filmed.

2786
02:19:54,530 --> 02:19:59,530
It's a pop off vodka presents and 
evening would tug stan hope and now 

2787
02:19:59,530 --> 02:20:01,640
we're selling it on vhs.
I don't know if we're sold out,

2788
02:20:01,641 --> 02:20:04,970
but we the only physical copies of vhs.
Really?

2789
02:20:05,150 --> 02:20:07,190
Yeah.
You can get it on Vimeo.

2790
02:20:07,191 --> 02:20:08,690
It's digital,
but I,

2791
02:20:08,700 --> 02:20:11,510
I took about an hour's worth of material
that uh,

2792
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:14,060
I think there's only 20 minutes on the 
vhs,

2793
02:20:14,090 --> 02:20:19,090
just the bit about pop up vodka presents
where we tried to get sponsorship with 

2794
02:20:20,450 --> 02:20:24,560
pop off because it's fucking low grade 
shitty vodka and I thought that would be

2795
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:29,800
a funny sponsor and Brian reached out 
and through channels that they said the 

2796
02:20:31,350 --> 02:20:35,580
pop off wouldn't touch doug stanhope 
with a 10 foot pole as what they said.

2797
02:20:36,170 --> 02:20:41,170
So I have this giant 20 minute fucking 
bit about it and I like I'm going to be 

2798
02:20:41,631 --> 02:20:46,631
sponsored by popoff vodka against their 
will and I'm going to fucking make a 

2799
02:20:46,631 --> 02:20:50,941
special call Papa Vodka presents and I'm
going to keep doing it until they give 

2800
02:20:50,941 --> 02:20:55,661
me a cease and desist the.
But I took an hour of material that get 

2801
02:20:55,791 --> 02:20:58,640
cut out of other specials where I go.
I really liked that bit.

2802
02:20:58,641 --> 02:21:03,641
I just had to cut it down to an hour.
I'm going to put this out as the papa 

2803
02:21:03,641 --> 02:21:04,640
vodka presents.
That's hilarious.

2804
02:21:04,790 --> 02:21:09,790
Do they know,
haven't gotten the cease and desist 

2805
02:21:09,790 --> 02:21:10,210
shirts?
It flopped up.

2806
02:21:12,020 --> 02:21:13,890
Fuck you.
Special.

2807
02:21:14,640 --> 02:21:17,390
You're going to tell me you're fucking 
rot.

2808
02:21:17,391 --> 02:21:22,300
Gut fucking.
They wouldn't touch liquid.

2809
02:21:22,450 --> 02:21:27,450
Jake was almost always the best word to 
use I think in a bit.

2810
02:21:28,971 --> 02:21:31,110
I think I'd say Hobo Plasma.

2811
02:21:33,610 --> 02:21:37,570
Oh,
bit that I uh,

2812
02:21:38,090 --> 02:21:41,840
but I want to experiment more with that.
And we've had a bunch of comics.

2813
02:21:42,170 --> 02:21:47,170
Olivia grace who opened last night.
She came down to Bisbee for road comics 

2814
02:21:48,230 --> 02:21:49,600
going to La.
You know what?

2815
02:21:49,630 --> 02:21:52,940
I'm going to do gigs in Austin.
It's kind of on the way.

2816
02:21:52,941 --> 02:21:56,120
So we've had a bunch of comics down and 
get drunk and go,

2817
02:21:56,121 --> 02:22:01,121
hey,
let's fucking do a show because if 15 

2818
02:22:01,121 --> 02:22:05,141
people in that room,
it's tiny enough that that's a real 

2819
02:22:05,141 --> 02:22:05,890
audience and we've never had a bad show.
They're like,

2820
02:22:05,891 --> 02:22:08,060
it just it.
And so yeah.

2821
02:22:08,061 --> 02:22:11,540
I want to film stuff.
I want to start experimenting with doing

2822
02:22:11,541 --> 02:22:16,541
like just putting out singles,
like my bits are fucking like you have 

2823
02:22:16,701 --> 02:22:19,680
bits that are fucking 17 minutes.
I don't,

2824
02:22:19,720 --> 02:22:21,340
I don't,
I'm not like Hedberg.

2825
02:22:21,341 --> 02:22:25,920
I don't want to have one liners so I can
take a 16 minute bit and just

2826
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:30,980
sell that as a single volume ninety nine
cents on itunes or I don't know how the.

2827
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:35,160
I don't know how that side of.
It's not a bad idea.

2828
02:22:35,550 --> 02:22:36,210
It probably,
you know,

2829
02:22:36,211 --> 02:22:39,270
there's a lot of people that do their 
podcasts with a subscription.

2830
02:22:39,271 --> 02:22:44,271
Like Nick Depaulo just released his new 
podcast and he's doing a subscription 

2831
02:22:44,271 --> 02:22:47,410
service.
We have to pay to listen to it can get.

2832
02:22:47,590 --> 02:22:52,590
That's one of the things when I retire 
is figure out shit like Patrion I've 

2833
02:22:52,590 --> 02:22:54,720
heard about and you can do this and 
yeah,

2834
02:22:54,721 --> 02:22:57,090
you just get people to give you money.
Yeah.

2835
02:22:57,091 --> 02:22:59,250
That's nice.
Let just give you must give me money.

2836
02:22:59,430 --> 02:23:02,130
They just give you money.
Like I really support you on Patrion.

2837
02:23:02,490 --> 02:23:04,110
Like there's a lot of people that do 
that.

2838
02:23:04,111 --> 02:23:06,810
They just do stuff like please support 
my Patrion oh,

2839
02:23:06,811 --> 02:23:08,730
please give me money.
Yeah,

2840
02:23:08,731 --> 02:23:09,780
I don't really like working.

2841
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:11,800
I like just talking in front of this 
Youtube Camera,

2842
02:23:11,801 --> 02:23:16,801
so if you like me talking to please 
support my patrion w when everyone talks

2843
02:23:17,431 --> 02:23:22,431
about their new hour,
I'm doing usually an hour and a half now

2844
02:23:22,500 --> 02:23:27,500
and I'm not doing five different bits 
that I really liked that I just got 

2845
02:23:28,951 --> 02:23:33,951
bored with,
but I still haven't recorded so I could 

2846
02:23:33,951 --> 02:23:37,521
put out a chunk of those like leftovers 
and no one's buying a fucking DVD 

2847
02:23:37,891 --> 02:23:40,620
anymore.
They're getting everything digital.

2848
02:23:41,010 --> 02:23:43,320
That's true.
So why not just,

2849
02:23:43,650 --> 02:23:45,270
hey,
this is a great 20 minutes.

2850
02:23:45,271 --> 02:23:47,280
I'm tired of it.
Let's put it out.

2851
02:23:48,300 --> 02:23:49,560
Yeah,
it's not a bad idea.

2852
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:53,790
I mean you could do youtube red to or 
you do it through subscriptions.

2853
02:23:54,840 --> 02:23:56,520
There's a bunch of different ways to do 
it now.

2854
02:23:56,790 --> 02:23:58,950
It's a,
there's more options every day.

2855
02:23:58,951 --> 02:23:59,520
Two,
it's,

2856
02:23:59,530 --> 02:24:01,260
it's,
it's becoming interesting.

2857
02:24:01,320 --> 02:24:03,660
I don't know.
Amazon releases a lot of stuff now too.

2858
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:07,080
They're releasing a lot of standup.
It's a.

2859
02:24:07,081 --> 02:24:09,540
it's really kind of amazed since there's
only one youtube.

2860
02:24:09,690 --> 02:24:10,920
That's what's really amazing.
I mean,

2861
02:24:10,921 --> 02:24:15,921
Vimeo does exist and it is good,
but in terms of like when people think 

2862
02:24:15,921 --> 02:24:19,500
of like one platform where you get 
videos on,

2863
02:24:19,740 --> 02:24:22,360
he really only think of Youtube.
Yeah.

2864
02:24:22,370 --> 02:24:24,090
Uh,
and monetizing.

2865
02:24:24,091 --> 02:24:28,670
I don't know how any of that works and 
Jamie could tell you I can help you.

2866
02:24:31,350 --> 02:24:33,240
It's not that complicated.
Yeah.

2867
02:24:33,241 --> 02:24:38,241
A lot of people do it and we're going to
have to fucking start doing video for 

2868
02:24:38,671 --> 02:24:40,230
our podcast.
Yeah.

2869
02:24:40,231 --> 02:24:43,170
How come you don't like doing that?
I just hate being on camera.

2870
02:24:43,171 --> 02:24:48,171
Like here you have it subtle enough.
I remember that your old studio where 

2871
02:24:48,660 --> 02:24:53,660
I'm looking at my face on a.
We start remembering the tripping that 

2872
02:24:54,090 --> 02:24:56,220
bad bad day.
Yeah.

2873
02:24:56,340 --> 02:25:01,340
We shouldn't have done that way.
That way was dumb because when we 

2874
02:25:01,340 --> 02:25:02,970
realized somewhere along the line that 
when they were up on that screen,

2875
02:25:02,971 --> 02:25:04,920
like we would look at ourselves on that 
screen.

2876
02:25:04,921 --> 02:25:09,921
It would make you think about it.
And then somewhere along the line I 

2877
02:25:09,921 --> 02:25:09,921
said,
let's stop doing this.

2878
02:25:09,921 --> 02:25:13,020
It's just doesn't seem like it's just a 
couple of Gopros.

2879
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:13,740
Yeah.
It's weird.

2880
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:16,860
So it's an added unnecessary element 
you're thinking about.

2881
02:25:16,890 --> 02:25:18,870
I don't think about that camera or that 
camera.

2882
02:25:19,060 --> 02:25:20,070
No.
Yeah,

2883
02:25:21,300 --> 02:25:24,370
yeah.
But I remember the first time I did your

2884
02:25:24,730 --> 02:25:29,730
podcast and we were sitting on a couch.
We're side by side,

2885
02:25:30,671 --> 02:25:35,671
so it's awkward and it was uncomfortable
couches or uncomfortable to like sit and

2886
02:25:36,311 --> 02:25:38,570
talk.
Like sit up and talk like you're sinking

2887
02:25:38,580 --> 02:25:41,620
into him and it just starts bothering 
you.

2888
02:25:41,720 --> 02:25:43,680
You want to look across someone you 
went,

2889
02:25:44,320 --> 02:25:49,320
yeah.
This is going to be nine years in 

2890
02:25:49,320 --> 02:25:49,320
December.
Yeah.

2891
02:25:49,320 --> 02:25:49,320
Look at you

2892
02:25:54,350 --> 02:25:57,050
crazy.
Yeah.

2893
02:25:57,051 --> 02:26:00,980
That couch was in [inaudible] house for.
You still have to make me hard sign.

2894
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:01,760
Yeah.

2895
02:26:03,220 --> 02:26:07,930
That was offensive to offensive for 
comedy central are you're doing.

2896
02:26:07,960 --> 02:26:09,970
So you're fun.
House is like,

2897
02:26:09,971 --> 02:26:14,971
you have an extra house so you have like
your main house where you live in and 

2898
02:26:14,971 --> 02:26:18,451
then you have the fun house that has a 
bar and we have a guest house and you 

2899
02:26:18,451 --> 02:26:20,290
bought a couple houses in town too,
right?

2900
02:26:20,740 --> 02:26:22,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

2901
02:26:22,451 --> 02:26:23,930
We get a few.
You're going to be,

2902
02:26:23,960 --> 02:26:25,560
you're becoming your own,
uh,

2903
02:26:26,170 --> 02:26:29,290
Oregon cult.
Like just slowly buy up the town.

2904
02:26:29,470 --> 02:26:31,990
Start renting it out to people that you 
like.

2905
02:26:32,200 --> 02:26:37,200
That's what the free state project 
remember that the Libertarian Movement 

2906
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:41,791
to try to get everyone to move to one 
state and that way we can all vote 

2907
02:26:41,791 --> 02:26:43,990
because we get one percent of the vote 
nationally,

2908
02:26:43,991 --> 02:26:45,820
but if we all lived in one state than we
could.

2909
02:26:46,690 --> 02:26:48,280
Yeah.
Then they picked New Hampshire.

2910
02:26:48,281 --> 02:26:51,760
Hi.
I'm not going to fucking fuck you.

2911
02:26:52,420 --> 02:26:55,930
It's just too hard to get laid up there.
It's too fucking cold.

2912
02:26:56,100 --> 02:27:00,190
It's too cold.
I haven't seen winter and many years.

2913
02:27:00,310 --> 02:27:05,310
I remember a Fitzsimmons got kicked out 
of a Gig up there and they had told him 

2914
02:27:05,410 --> 02:27:08,350
not to drive at night because there's so
many moose on the road.

2915
02:27:09,130 --> 02:27:14,130
But uh,
they kicked them out of the Gig for 

2916
02:27:14,130 --> 02:27:14,130
swearing.
They filed.

2917
02:27:14,130 --> 02:27:14,130
They fired him when he,
when he got there,

2918
02:27:14,130 --> 02:27:16,960
they had his bags packed when he got off
stage and they said,

2919
02:27:16,961 --> 02:27:21,961
you're fired.
Get out because you're supposed to be 

2920
02:27:21,961 --> 02:27:21,961
there for the weekend.
And they made them drive home.

2921
02:27:21,961 --> 02:27:24,040
I'm guessing this is a long time ago.
Oh yeah.

2922
02:27:24,041 --> 02:27:27,370
We were both starting out.
Fucking Fitzsimmons is a hothead.

2923
02:27:27,460 --> 02:27:28,100
Oh,
he's a hothead.

2924
02:27:28,150 --> 02:27:30,820
Is that.
I never saw that in him.

2925
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:32,440
Oh yeah.
He's always been.

2926
02:27:32,441 --> 02:27:37,441
He's Irish.
He's always been a hothead as long as 

2927
02:27:37,441 --> 02:27:39,961
I've done a podcast a few years ago and 
he almost came to fisticuffs with a 

2928
02:27:40,331 --> 02:27:41,650
fucking parking attended.

2929
02:27:41,650 --> 02:27:42,610
Like,
fuck you.

2930
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:44,920
You want to fucking like,
really?

2931
02:27:44,980 --> 02:27:48,340
Yeah.
His face just fucking beet red.

2932
02:27:48,341 --> 02:27:50,980
He was gonna beat the fuck out of the 
guy just ignored me.

2933
02:27:50,981 --> 02:27:55,981
He was so angry.
I was just waiting there to do his 

2934
02:27:55,981 --> 02:27:58,750
podcast and he just blows by me like I'm
a problem to like fuck,

2935
02:27:58,990 --> 02:28:01,930
just ate raged.
That's hilarious.

2936
02:28:02,700 --> 02:28:07,700
Yeah.
And then we get on the podcast and he's 

2937
02:28:07,700 --> 02:28:07,700
fine.
Professional.

2938
02:28:07,700 --> 02:28:09,670
Yeah,
I do too.

2939
02:28:09,760 --> 02:28:12,190
We started out together like within a 
week apart from each other.

2940
02:28:12,220 --> 02:28:13,150
Oh no shit.
Yeah,

2941
02:28:13,151 --> 02:28:15,510
we're buddies.
We're raw open micros.

2942
02:28:15,640 --> 02:28:20,640
We steal jokes from each other,
like we didn't really have enough 

2943
02:28:20,640 --> 02:28:22,100
material to do like a half an hour.
So like he would do some

2944
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:27,100
of my shit.
I do some of his shit and he would tell 

2945
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:27,100
me,
Oh yeah,

2946
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:30,160
that blow job.
It worked great and fucking some shit 

2947
02:28:30,160 --> 02:28:30,980
hole in the middle of nowhere.
Like when you,

2948
02:28:30,981 --> 02:28:35,981
when we were like a year and we were 
both about a year and when we started 

2949
02:28:35,981 --> 02:28:38,000
getting paid gigs,
but when you're a year and you've really

2950
02:28:38,001 --> 02:28:39,540
don't have shit.

2951
02:28:40,410 --> 02:28:45,410
My first,
my first right before I moved to 

2952
02:28:45,410 --> 02:28:48,111
Phoenix,
my first paid road Gig was in flagstaff 

2953
02:28:48,111 --> 02:28:51,681
for Sandy Hackett.
And I was co headlining with a 

2954
02:28:51,681 --> 02:28:53,220
ventriloquist who'd never worked at 
comedy club.

2955
02:28:53,221 --> 02:28:55,200
He only worked at the county fair 
circuits.

2956
02:28:55,560 --> 02:28:58,440
And he was,
I remember he was so weird.

2957
02:28:59,220 --> 02:29:03,990
He was an old historic hotel that we 
were staying in that they put us up in.

2958
02:29:03,991 --> 02:29:08,910
The gig is in and he moved to a 
different hotel because this was so old.

2959
02:29:09,060 --> 02:29:14,060
He thought it was a fire hazard.
And he said one time he played a cruise 

2960
02:29:14,060 --> 02:29:19,041
ship and someone threw his dummy 
overboard and he can't go through that 

2961
02:29:19,041 --> 02:29:23,301
again if he lost this dummy in a fire.
So he paid probably as much as he was 

2962
02:29:23,730 --> 02:29:27,270
making for the Gig to get his own hotel.
It was a decent hotel.

2963
02:29:27,720 --> 02:29:29,390
And uh,
I,

2964
02:29:29,780 --> 02:29:30,910
I remember,
I,

2965
02:29:30,911 --> 02:29:35,911
I think I only had to do like 30 or 35 
minutes and I was stretching to get 27 

2966
02:29:37,471 --> 02:29:42,471
with everything I had.
I remember stealing some jokes from one 

2967
02:29:42,471 --> 02:29:45,060
of the Vegas open mic or is where I 
lived at.

2968
02:29:45,061 --> 02:29:46,890
Go back and say,
Oh hey,

2969
02:29:46,891 --> 02:29:51,891
I use some of your material because I 
had to fill time and then find I find 

2970
02:29:51,891 --> 02:29:51,891
out later that was.

2971
02:29:55,570 --> 02:29:57,810
And they look at you sideways.
Oh yeah.

2972
02:29:57,811 --> 02:29:58,420
Okay.
All right.

2973
02:29:58,430 --> 02:30:00,360
It was,
I really don't do it again.

2974
02:30:00,361 --> 02:30:03,810
Okay.
Yeah,

2975
02:30:03,811 --> 02:30:04,650
those,
uh,

2976
02:30:04,830 --> 02:30:09,330
road gigs back then that mean you didn't
realize it at the time,

2977
02:30:09,331 --> 02:30:14,331
but what a,
it's all of it builds up to be this 

2978
02:30:14,331 --> 02:30:16,820
giant education in how to do standup and
those,

2979
02:30:17,160 --> 02:30:20,610
the foundation of those road gigs is 
irreplaceable.

2980
02:30:20,670 --> 02:30:22,110
Yeah.
All my favorite comics,

2981
02:30:22,111 --> 02:30:24,130
they started out doing the road,
you know,

2982
02:30:24,131 --> 02:30:25,290
all,
everybody.

2983
02:30:25,291 --> 02:30:26,190
Joey,
you,

2984
02:30:26,450 --> 02:30:28,330
Ari Duncan.
I don't know

2985
02:30:28,350 --> 02:30:33,350
if anyone has done this as a gimmick.
I know that this is a town of Gimmick 

2986
02:30:33,350 --> 02:30:37,040
shows.
My first notebook as anything.

2987
02:30:37,350 --> 02:30:37,870
Yeah.
Owen,

2988
02:30:37,930 --> 02:30:38,820
Benjamin.
I mean,

2989
02:30:38,821 --> 02:30:40,150
not all.
Benjamin Owen Smith,

2990
02:30:40,390 --> 02:30:45,390
Owen Smith has a show that he does 
online where I brought him some 

2991
02:30:45,390 --> 02:30:49,690
notebooks from like 90 to 91 and 92 
terrible material,

2992
02:30:49,930 --> 02:30:51,880
terrible.
And we read,

2993
02:30:51,910 --> 02:30:56,910
we read over some of the jokes and I 
even had like forced setups and forced 

2994
02:30:57,221 --> 02:31:02,221
like audience interaction.
I fake audience interaction where asked 

2995
02:31:02,221 --> 02:31:03,400
him a question and pretend to hear an 
answer.

2996
02:31:03,670 --> 02:31:05,200
Oh,
it was awful.

2997
02:31:05,230 --> 02:31:06,490
It was awful.
I'm like,

2998
02:31:06,491 --> 02:31:08,110
am I right ladies?
Like I had that.

2999
02:31:08,620 --> 02:31:13,620
Is this on stage?
We did it in the back bar of the comedy 

3000
02:31:13,620 --> 02:31:17,311
store and we would go over the.
We were going over the notebook just 

3001
02:31:17,311 --> 02:31:17,560
laughing.
Oh I bet I have,

3002
02:31:17,561 --> 02:31:19,980
but I a fun show

3003
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:24,390
is you have to go up and do your fucking
do the act.

3004
02:31:24,420 --> 02:31:25,510
Right,
right.

3005
02:31:25,650 --> 02:31:27,480
Well the thing is I don't,

3006
02:31:28,300 --> 02:31:30,710
I didn't have the act like clearly 
written.

3007
02:31:30,711 --> 02:31:35,160
Now all you have material from the first
notebook.

3008
02:31:35,510 --> 02:31:40,510
Well back then if I wrote a hundred 
things down and one of them was halfway 

3009
02:31:41,920 --> 02:31:46,920
worth talking about it,
it was amazing because I didn't know 

3010
02:31:46,920 --> 02:31:46,920
what I was doing.
I first notebook.

3011
02:31:46,920 --> 02:31:51,330
I have written out my four minutes or 
whatever it was including.

3012
02:31:53,410 --> 02:31:58,410
Hi,
my name is Doug Stanhope is written 

3013
02:31:59,410 --> 02:32:02,020
well,
if you want to practice correctly.

3014
02:32:02,350 --> 02:32:04,480
I know guys who used to practice in 
front of the mirror.

3015
02:32:05,190 --> 02:32:07,150
They would just stand in front of the 
mirror and do their act.

3016
02:32:08,170 --> 02:32:10,840
Hey,
am I right or a monitor wrong?

3017
02:32:11,670 --> 02:32:14,230
We do here.
I don't know if I ever did that,

3018
02:32:14,231 --> 02:32:19,231
but I was certainly the guy pacing in 
the back alley saying it out loud and 

3019
02:32:20,100 --> 02:32:22,510
know with the hand gestures and 
everything.

3020
02:32:22,540 --> 02:32:24,130
Yeah,
just going over in your head.

3021
02:32:24,400 --> 02:32:26,670
I know a guy used to do.
Yeah.

3022
02:32:26,830 --> 02:32:31,830
I know I used to do is act on camera.
He do it alone in a room like in a 

3023
02:32:31,830 --> 02:32:35,611
bedroom,
set up camera and do his act to the 

3024
02:32:35,611 --> 02:32:35,611
camera and then go back and watch and 
analyze it.

3025
02:32:35,800 --> 02:32:36,750
Oh,
I got you.

3026
02:32:36,820 --> 02:32:38,380
You get those emails.
Hey,

3027
02:32:39,900 --> 02:32:44,900
I'm doing comedy now.
Tell me what you think and you click on 

3028
02:32:44,951 --> 02:32:47,500
the link and it's a youtube of them in 
their basement.

3029
02:32:47,580 --> 02:32:52,580
Just Thompson camera by themselves.
Like the with the eyes of that youtube 

3030
02:32:52,580 --> 02:32:56,800
shooter lady.
Creepy reading you off their material.

3031
02:32:58,750 --> 02:33:03,750
Imagine having to do it again.
It's one of the things that Dan Cook 

3032
02:33:03,750 --> 02:33:03,750
said once.
The one thing that I could never imagine

3033
02:33:03,750 --> 02:33:07,300
doing in life is starting over as a 
standup from the beginning again,

3034
02:33:08,210 --> 02:33:08,510
like

3035
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:12,750
as I have an idea,
but I'm not,

3036
02:33:12,870 --> 02:33:15,210
I don't want to.
I don't want to air it,

3037
02:33:15,280 --> 02:33:20,280
but something that I want to do in my,
in my retirement years.

3038
02:33:22,050 --> 02:33:24,900
But uh,
it's not quite that but.

3039
02:33:25,200 --> 02:33:30,200
But what comics ask you,
like the amount of emails,

3040
02:33:30,750 --> 02:33:33,390
what advice do you have?
How do I start out?

3041
02:33:33,540 --> 02:33:34,290
Well,
I don't know.

3042
02:33:34,291 --> 02:33:38,100
I haven't started in 28 years,
so I want to interact with you.

3043
02:33:38,460 --> 02:33:40,080
They're just trying to find a way to 
interact with you.

3044
02:33:40,081 --> 02:33:42,150
If they wanted us to figure out how to 
start out.

3045
02:33:42,170 --> 02:33:43,590
This is not,
they're not going to be able to ask you.

3046
02:33:43,591 --> 02:33:45,740
They got to go to open mic nights.
Ask the guide.

3047
02:33:45,741 --> 02:33:48,610
That's if you haven't done an open mic 
at,

3048
02:33:48,690 --> 02:33:52,020
go to an open mic and ask an open mic or
where do I do?

3049
02:33:52,230 --> 02:33:57,230
And if you're an open mic or that wants 
to get work as an mc than asking him see

3050
02:33:58,230 --> 02:34:03,230
what he did,
he asked the guy just above you because 

3051
02:34:03,230 --> 02:34:06,051
he knows.
I don't know how the fuck you think I 

3052
02:34:06,051 --> 02:34:06,840
know what the Dorfman's look for in a 
fuck.

3053
02:34:07,770 --> 02:34:08,250
But uh,

3054
02:34:10,360 --> 02:34:10,690
yeah,
I mean,

3055
02:34:10,691 --> 02:34:13,360
if you want to be a theory,
theoretical mathematician,

3056
02:34:13,960 --> 02:34:18,960
you don't go to.
Some guy was teaching at Harvard and 

3057
02:34:18,960 --> 02:34:18,960
say,
Hey man,

3058
02:34:18,960 --> 02:34:23,640
how do I get started?
I haven't gone to elementary school yet,

3059
02:34:26,110 --> 02:34:31,110
but I'm thinking about it.
It means people that want advice,

3060
02:34:31,330 --> 02:34:33,340
like there's no way you can give an 
advice anyway.

3061
02:34:33,560 --> 02:34:35,500
You would have to see them a whole bunch
of times.

3062
02:34:35,950 --> 02:34:37,590
And even then you'd have to be like,
hmm,

3063
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:42,600
what are you trying to do?
Were you trying to go and then watch 

3064
02:34:42,600 --> 02:34:42,600
them or watch them try to get better.
I mean,

3065
02:34:42,600 --> 02:34:44,320
the best advice you could ever give us.
Do it.

3066
02:34:44,710 --> 02:34:46,660
Listen,
record.

3067
02:34:46,690 --> 02:34:49,420
Write down what sucks about it.
Write down what work.

3068
02:34:49,421 --> 02:34:50,950
Well do it again,
right?

3069
02:34:51,100 --> 02:34:52,120
Right.
Performed,

3070
02:34:52,121 --> 02:34:53,350
suck,
right?

3071
02:34:53,430 --> 02:34:56,320
Repeat.
And you're going to start as a five word

3072
02:34:56,321 --> 02:35:00,460
response performed suck.
Rewrite,

3073
02:35:00,490 --> 02:35:01,810
repeat,
just keep doing it.

3074
02:35:02,260 --> 02:35:04,660
You have to keep doing it.
It's something that you just don't.

3075
02:35:04,720 --> 02:35:09,720
You're not going to be great right off.
Like anybody that thinks they're going 

3076
02:35:09,720 --> 02:35:09,720
to be amazing at this.
Like right off the bat you're like,

3077
02:35:09,720 --> 02:35:11,020
oh,
I can't.

3078
02:35:11,200 --> 02:35:13,720
It's not possible,
and if you're asking me,

3079
02:35:13,721 --> 02:35:15,880
I might think you suck.
Yeah.

3080
02:35:16,030 --> 02:35:16,960
And if I say,
well,

3081
02:35:17,070 --> 02:35:22,070
you suck.
Well other people might think you're 

3082
02:35:22,070 --> 02:35:22,070
funny,
so don't listen to me.

3083
02:35:22,070 --> 02:35:25,000
That was the best.
My refrain.

3084
02:35:25,270 --> 02:35:30,270
Joey Zola was a guy that was just a 
little above me and I was given advice 

3085
02:35:31,121 --> 02:35:33,880
to a kid that was just below me when I 
was at know,

3086
02:35:34,140 --> 02:35:37,780
just above open miker and Jelly pulled 
me aside.

3087
02:35:37,781 --> 02:35:40,300
He goes,
don't give these kids advice because all

3088
02:35:40,301 --> 02:35:42,400
you ever doing is telling them how to be
like,

3089
02:35:42,401 --> 02:35:43,710
you know.
Yeah,

3090
02:35:43,720 --> 02:35:45,310
that's true.
That is,

3091
02:35:45,320 --> 02:35:47,260
I would have fucking told Dane Cook.

3092
02:35:47,710 --> 02:35:49,330
Yeah,
you're never going to.

3093
02:35:49,600 --> 02:35:53,800
You're never going to be good at this.
I'm not your audience.

3094
02:35:55,440 --> 02:36:00,440
Well,
comedy is always going to suffer from 

3095
02:36:00,440 --> 02:36:00,440
that because there's no categories,
you know?

3096
02:36:00,440 --> 02:36:01,960
I mean,
it's not like a blues or.

3097
02:36:02,480 --> 02:36:03,700
Yeah.
Disco,

3098
02:36:03,920 --> 02:36:05,200
you know,
Jazz,

3099
02:36:05,230 --> 02:36:10,230
rock and roll,
there's comedy and there's different 

3100
02:36:10,230 --> 02:36:11,030
kinds of comedy,
different ways doing,

3101
02:36:11,050 --> 02:36:14,860
but there's no categories.
So they used to build me as x rated just

3102
02:36:14,861 --> 02:36:17,980
because there wasn't a category,
but they wanted to warn people.

3103
02:36:18,750 --> 02:36:22,810
The signs that I still have on all my 
shows to this day,

3104
02:36:23,080 --> 02:36:28,080
it said,
it says warning Joe Rogan show contains 

3105
02:36:28,080 --> 02:36:30,190
the strongest material content 
imaginable because.

3106
02:36:30,320 --> 02:36:31,910
Because like I got tired of people 
complaining,

3107
02:36:32,040 --> 02:36:34,870
I said,
tell them that it contains like the most

3108
02:36:34,871 --> 02:36:38,800
fucked up things imaginable.
So if they read that and they go in,

3109
02:36:39,140 --> 02:36:40,180
I couldn't be like,
wow,

3110
02:36:40,181 --> 02:36:41,260
I couldn't imagine that.

3111
02:36:41,560 --> 02:36:46,560
Like it says,
the most mature thing imaginable.

3112
02:36:47,340 --> 02:36:52,340
I was,
I remember a plane xannies in Chicago 

3113
02:36:52,340 --> 02:36:56,880
and having a really hard week of 
walkouts and angry people even though 

3114
02:36:57,281 --> 02:36:58,730
they build it as,
you know,

3115
02:36:58,750 --> 02:37:00,720
adult or x rated.
Yeah.

3116
02:37:00,730 --> 02:37:04,030
There's my.
I post that all my shows.

3117
02:37:04,031 --> 02:37:06,440
I've had that shit.
That's what you were just in Tucson.

3118
02:37:06,470 --> 02:37:10,210
It didn't go Tucson's fucking great.
First of all,

3119
02:37:10,211 --> 02:37:14,020
how cool does it desert look out there?
It looks fake and all those.

3120
02:37:14,240 --> 02:37:19,240
The guy was us,
told us that there were a cactuses that 

3121
02:37:19,240 --> 02:37:20,240
have gps in them because people are 
stealing cactuses,

3122
02:37:20,710 --> 02:37:25,710
so it's still cactus,
the GPS and the cactus and arrest 

3123
02:37:25,710 --> 02:37:25,710
people,
their house,

3124
02:37:25,710 --> 02:37:30,110
the fucking cactus Solara desert.
Did you drive back after that kid?

3125
02:37:30,411 --> 02:37:32,610
Because I went to Phoenix.
We drove to feed.

3126
02:37:32,611 --> 02:37:36,050
And you told me you didn't come up?
Yeah,

3127
02:37:36,380 --> 02:37:39,650
I'm originally,
I was going to do other gigs that week,

3128
02:37:39,651 --> 02:37:40,700
but it's too many things.

3129
02:37:40,700 --> 02:37:45,700
Got moved around.
I want to flying into boise the next 

3130
02:37:45,700 --> 02:37:45,700
day.
Um,

3131
02:37:45,700 --> 02:37:46,240
when you,
uh,

3132
02:37:46,280 --> 02:37:51,280
traveled to Asia,
how many different places do you go 

3133
02:37:51,280 --> 02:37:54,250
where it's all x paths.
It's all ex pat.

3134
02:37:54,400 --> 02:37:58,340
That's the first time I've done one of 
those Tom Rhodes tours where,

3135
02:37:58,360 --> 02:38:00,500
uh,
it was a Hong Kong,

3136
02:38:00,501 --> 02:38:05,501
Singapore did Shanghai a Hoochie Minh 
City.

3137
02:38:08,090 --> 02:38:10,160
Tokyo,
Tokyo.

3138
02:38:11,150 --> 02:38:12,650
Tokyo is fascinating.
Huh?

3139
02:38:13,040 --> 02:38:15,500
It seems like a whole different world 
like this.

3140
02:38:15,550 --> 02:38:20,550
Look at you.
You landed in an alien world where the 

3141
02:38:20,550 --> 02:38:22,130
languages all different with the people 
look like us there,

3142
02:38:22,131 --> 02:38:24,230
you know,
I can put a little different that didn't

3143
02:38:24,270 --> 02:38:27,190
really didn't venture out much.
Uh,

3144
02:38:27,590 --> 02:38:28,910
but yeah,
it's pretty weird.

3145
02:38:28,970 --> 02:38:30,740
But everyone's friendly.
Yeah.

3146
02:38:30,830 --> 02:38:34,580
Singapore is fucking amazing.
It's like that movie Elisa,

3147
02:38:34,660 --> 02:38:38,480
them.
Oh really is absolutely safe.

3148
02:38:38,930 --> 02:38:41,540
Beautiful.
No crime.

3149
02:38:41,550 --> 02:38:42,560
Super wealthy.
Right.

3150
02:38:42,710 --> 02:38:45,500
Very wealthy.
Like more than New York City.

3151
02:38:45,501 --> 02:38:47,540
Like more expensive to live in the New 
York City.

3152
02:38:47,810 --> 02:38:50,410
I don't know.
I,

3153
02:38:50,411 --> 02:38:52,660
I know it's very expensive.
Uh,

3154
02:38:52,670 --> 02:38:56,360
I was doing a,
they were paying for all these five star

3155
02:38:56,361 --> 02:39:00,050
hotels and shit where I probably took a 
bath on the guarantee.

3156
02:39:01,900 --> 02:39:04,550
If I paid my own way,
I could've done it way cheaper.

3157
02:39:04,970 --> 02:39:05,390
But,
uh,

3158
02:39:05,810 --> 02:39:06,870
it's,
it's,

3159
02:39:06,890 --> 02:39:11,890
it's super wealthy.
Like Hong Kong is all fucking 

3160
02:39:11,890 --> 02:39:16,421
international banker flux.
That's high dollar and Singapore are the

3161
02:39:16,641 --> 02:39:18,950
people that pay them.
Oh Wow.

3162
02:39:19,300 --> 02:39:19,880
So,
uh,

3163
02:39:19,881 --> 02:39:23,030
you know,
it wasn't the ex pats I was expecting.

3164
02:39:23,390 --> 02:39:28,390
So when you're there,
like how big are the places you're 

3165
02:39:28,390 --> 02:39:28,390
doing?

3166
02:39:28,390 --> 02:39:28,660
Uh,

3167
02:39:31,250 --> 02:39:36,110
I was like 600 ish.
Uh,

3168
02:39:36,580 --> 02:39:41,260
mostly people from,
well not necessarily the state,

3169
02:39:41,261 --> 02:39:43,300
somewhere in England,
Australia,

3170
02:39:43,360 --> 02:39:48,360
Canada,
and there's just a lot of people that 

3171
02:39:48,360 --> 02:39:48,360
moved there for work or.
Well,

3172
02:39:48,360 --> 02:39:49,750
Hong Kong and Singapore.
Again,

3173
02:39:49,751 --> 02:39:52,450
a lot of international banker,
you know,

3174
02:39:52,840 --> 02:39:54,790
fucking tight suits,
lots of blow,

3175
02:39:55,330 --> 02:39:57,940
probably skinny,
skinny jeans.

3176
02:39:58,210 --> 02:40:02,020
And below 10 bucks and want to see my 
new car.

3177
02:40:02,050 --> 02:40:05,050
Come on.
Vietnam,

3178
02:40:05,080 --> 02:40:06,970
Bangkok,
little seedier.

3179
02:40:07,360 --> 02:40:08,950
How many different places do you do in 
Asia?

3180
02:40:09,830 --> 02:40:12,610
That was in Bangkok,
Thailand,

3181
02:40:13,320 --> 02:40:14,370
Vietnam,

3182
02:40:14,910 --> 02:40:16,860
Hong Kong,
Shanghai.

3183
02:40:18,430 --> 02:40:21,810
I think I'm missing a couple.
Uh,

3184
02:40:21,900 --> 02:40:25,050
Tokyo now.
It was,

3185
02:40:25,170 --> 02:40:27,000
but it was a,
it was so quick.

3186
02:40:27,150 --> 02:40:29,490
So you're doing a different country 
every day.

3187
02:40:29,491 --> 02:40:33,280
So every day is another fucking visa,
you know,

3188
02:40:33,750 --> 02:40:37,690
customs and just

3189
02:40:37,820 --> 02:40:41,210
crush you and your immune system.
Now the constant traveling.

3190
02:40:41,340 --> 02:40:46,340
When I'm traveling every day,
I can only do that a few days in a row 

3191
02:40:46,340 --> 02:40:46,340
after awhile I'm like,
what?

3192
02:40:46,340 --> 02:40:50,711
Because I don't get any sleep.
I don't sleep well when I'm getting up 

3193
02:40:50,711 --> 02:40:50,840
in the morning.
You got to get up early for the flight.

3194
02:40:51,120 --> 02:40:53,000
Then you try to take a nap.
You're barely sleep.

3195
02:40:53,001 --> 02:40:55,340
You sleep a few hours at night,
you got to get up in the morning again.

3196
02:40:55,670 --> 02:41:00,670
You're doing a show.
So you're wired after the show and then 

3197
02:41:00,670 --> 02:41:00,670
they're like two,
three days in your exhaust it,

3198
02:41:00,670 --> 02:41:02,090
it was pretty brutal.
Yeah.

3199
02:41:02,990 --> 02:41:07,990
I think the way to do it is to spread it
out over long periods of time so that 

3200
02:41:07,990 --> 02:41:10,670
you do a Gig and then you hang out in 
the city for like a few days,

3201
02:41:10,940 --> 02:41:12,860
chill out,
see what's there,

3202
02:41:12,920 --> 02:41:14,300
then move onto the next place.

3203
02:41:15,190 --> 02:41:17,770
I I liked.
All right,

3204
02:41:17,771 --> 02:41:21,390
let's get it out of the way because 
those days off I go,

3205
02:41:21,610 --> 02:41:23,470
oh wow.
Look at temple.

3206
02:41:23,500 --> 02:41:25,120
Let's party.
Look at the Buddha.

3207
02:41:25,121 --> 02:41:27,820
Let's drink.
Let's go with a Buddha.

3208
02:41:28,820 --> 02:41:31,960
I,
I'm a lot healthier when I have a lot of

3209
02:41:31,961 --> 02:41:36,340
gigs in a row because then I stay sober 
until show time.

3210
02:41:36,370 --> 02:41:38,020
You tried quitting cigarettes for a 
while?

3211
02:41:38,440 --> 02:41:39,470
Yeah.
How?

3212
02:41:39,530 --> 02:41:41,440
I always try.
How long did you have for?

3213
02:41:42,760 --> 02:41:46,420
The longest was a year in 2008.
Really?

3214
02:41:46,540 --> 02:41:51,540
I did six weeks of.
Of couple years ago and then got a book 

3215
02:41:51,540 --> 02:41:52,400
deal and what?
Alright.

3216
02:41:52,480 --> 02:41:56,560
That's the one thing I can't fuck.
I cannot write and not smoke.

3217
02:41:56,650 --> 02:41:57,430
Really?
Yeah.

3218
02:41:57,431 --> 02:42:01,540
That's still the hardest thing to do.
Quitting like eventually.

3219
02:42:01,541 --> 02:42:02,080
Okay.
Yeah.

3220
02:42:02,081 --> 02:42:04,480
I can go.
I can drink and not smoke.

3221
02:42:04,630 --> 02:42:08,770
I can go out and I could do interviews 
on the phone.

3222
02:42:08,771 --> 02:42:11,170
That's usually where you get to do 
interviews.

3223
02:42:11,171 --> 02:42:14,020
I'm chain smoking,
but writing a book,

3224
02:42:14,021 --> 02:42:19,021
writing now it's just constant.
Hinchcliffe had a real problem with 

3225
02:42:19,811 --> 02:42:20,080
that.

3226
02:42:20,460 --> 02:42:23,800
Who Hinchcliffe he would write when you 
write for roasts and things like that.

3227
02:42:23,801 --> 02:42:26,890
Always be smoking cigarettes is 
associated cigarettes with writing,

3228
02:42:27,280 --> 02:42:29,770
but he quit smoking cigarettes and it 
took them awhile.

3229
02:42:29,800 --> 02:42:33,490
So there was a cranky period.
Took a while to like get over the hump.

3230
02:42:33,910 --> 02:42:35,290
Got One of those vape pens.

3231
02:42:35,920 --> 02:42:37,320
Yeah.
Yeah.

3232
02:42:37,440 --> 02:42:38,580
Bingo.
Uses those.

3233
02:42:38,670 --> 02:42:43,670
That's what I was going to.
I said I'm going to bring your vape pen 

3234
02:42:43,670 --> 02:42:46,251
to Rogan's because I don't want to smoke
and ruin his fucking studio again and 

3235
02:42:46,251 --> 02:42:48,630
fine.
Seems to be working good.

3236
02:42:48,950 --> 02:42:50,270
I mean,
I could smell it,

3237
02:42:50,271 --> 02:42:52,970
but I mean there's no,
it's not like thick in the air.

3238
02:42:53,600 --> 02:42:56,240
The fan works.
Does it have filters?

3239
02:42:56,241 --> 02:42:57,920
Jamey,
do we have to clean filters?

3240
02:42:57,980 --> 02:42:58,640
Do we know anything

3241
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:00,550
after,
after today,

3242
02:43:00,730 --> 02:43:02,290
after today,
motherfucker.

3243
02:43:03,400 --> 02:43:04,690
Douglas.
It's already 2:00.

3244
02:43:04,960 --> 02:43:06,520
Uh,
we did three hours.

3245
02:43:06,850 --> 02:43:07,710
Really?
Yeah.

3246
02:43:07,820 --> 02:43:09,730
No Shit doesn't even make sense.
Right?

3247
02:43:10,030 --> 02:43:11,170
Time flies by that.

3248
02:43:12,420 --> 02:43:15,190
Um,
anything to tell these people nothing to

3249
02:43:15,191 --> 02:43:19,240
promote.
This is on my first day of retirement,

3250
02:43:19,840 --> 02:43:24,840
the retirement of Doug's Stan hope,
which we'll get to take a 10 day train 

3251
02:43:24,840 --> 02:43:28,321
trip going nowhere but on the train.
Go to Chicago to Saunders,

3252
02:43:28,350 --> 02:43:32,650
Chicago to Portland,
down to La and back to Tucson.

3253
02:43:32,790 --> 02:43:35,200
Salsify hanging around on a train.
Beautiful.

3254
02:43:35,290 --> 02:43:36,150
Yeah.
I love it.

3255
02:43:36,460 --> 02:43:38,740
Love fucking moving.
Yeah man.

3256
02:43:38,800 --> 02:43:42,010
I mean you don't have to do anything.
You can do whatever the fuck you want.

3257
02:43:42,011 --> 02:43:46,030
That's the American dream.
The American dream is not just success.

3258
02:43:46,031 --> 02:43:48,770
It's also freedom.
Freedom to do whatever.

3259
02:43:48,820 --> 02:43:50,090
Not Be trapped.
Like to,

3260
02:43:50,130 --> 02:43:54,820
to be wise enough to not be trapped by 
your bills or your previous commitments.

3261
02:43:55,090 --> 02:43:56,890
Bang it out,
make enough money,

3262
02:43:57,190 --> 02:43:59,590
stockpile your finances and go,
okay,

3263
02:43:59,591 --> 02:44:01,060
we're good.
It's just,

3264
02:44:01,250 --> 02:44:03,130
it's just fucking chill.
Live cheap.

3265
02:44:03,340 --> 02:44:08,340
Discount meets lesson to you all.
America live like Doug Stanhope or 

3266
02:44:08,340 --> 02:44:09,380
don't.
Is that it?

3267
02:44:09,860 --> 02:44:11,080
That's it.
Goodnight everybody.

3268
02:44:11,110 --> 02:44:12,100
Thanks.
Bye.

3269
02:44:14,580 --> 02:44:16,180
That was fucking three hours.
