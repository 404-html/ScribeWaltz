1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,900
Five,
four,

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,100
three,
two.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,830
The infamous Jamie countdown our 
lifetime.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,200
What is up man?
Tom Bilyeu.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,310
If you're wondering,
Bill,

6
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:14,390
you believe people are wondering like,
how do I say that pill?

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,400
You Dude,
I've eaten more of your bars than any 

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,861
bar ever in the history of bars next to 
you in the primal kitchen bars.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,610
Whoa,
that's it.

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,850
You're in fucking La Company there,
man.

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,710
That's God.
Goddamn quest bars.

12
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:30,900
The Shit.
Especially those chocolate Brownie ones.

13
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:32,100
Dude,
tell me about it.

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,210
Guys.
Nailed it with those.

15
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,240
Thank you.
So what was the idea behind the company 

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,091
is like some low sugar,
low carb Nutricia and yet at the time 

17
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:41,520
that we were thinking of launching the 
company,

18
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:46,521
there was nothing on the market that we 
would eat at either tasted terribly and 

19
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:48,270
was good for you or it tasted great and 
was horrible for you.

20
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:53,271
So we wanted to create the first bar 
that tasted like it had sugar but 

21
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:53,271
didn't.

22
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:54,000
And metabolically speaking had a great 
response to it.

23
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:59,001
It's a grind man to find.
If you try to go on a Keto Diet and you 

24
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,590
know,
you try to find like really good,

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,530
healthy,
delicious stuff to snack on,

26
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,240
like boy,
here's a question.

27
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:09,300
Two quest bars kick you out of Ketosis.
No,

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,120
really know if I eat a full bar,
I'm going to be out.

29
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:12,810
Really?
Sure.

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,010
But it only has nine grams of carbs.
Grams of protein is high,

31
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:17,540
so it.
Well,

32
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,540
it's actually less than that depending.
Do you count net carbs or full blown?

33
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,490
You know what?
I'm very loose with it.

34
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:25,050
I don't do a whole lot of counting 
carbs.

35
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:27,600
For the most part.
What I'm doing is eating whole foods.

36
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,990
The most part I'm doing is a lot of,
a lot of that primal kitchen.

37
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,030
You know that pole lay Mayo,
that aaa lime,

38
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,490
Mayo Bullshit.

39
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,760
Fucking fantastic.
I might eat a case of that a month and 

40
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,111
I'm not bullshitting.
I put it on everything because it's 

41
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:49,170
super high fat and really delicious.
So I put it on eggs.

42
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,400
I go cook up a couple of eggs in the 
morning and then I'll take some scoops 

43
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,671
so that chipotle a line male and just 
slap it on there with sliced Jalapenos 

44
00:01:57,671 --> 00:01:59,370
and so we get a lot of facts.
You know the macros on it?

45
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,690
No,
I don't talk to that.

46
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:03,120
All that shit.
But you stay in Ketosis,

47
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,770
you can take your blood levels have.
Yeah,

48
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,830
I have do it on a regular basis.
I just essentially eat.

49
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:15,831
I,
well what I'm doing is for the most 

50
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:15,831
part,
if I'm eating foods,

51
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:17,490
the foods that I'm eating are very high 
fat,

52
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,020
very low carbs and then 20 percent of 
the time I fuck off 20 percent of the 

53
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:30,441
time,
like 20 percent into like I try not to 

54
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:30,441
fuck off too hard.

55
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,620
Like with desserts and stuff like that.
Do you like desserts?

56
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,300
Yes.
Even on a Keto Diet,

57
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:35,040
you don't find that that's reduced?
Yeah,

58
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,680
it is reduced,
but once you start eating the ice cream,

59
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:39,170
you remember how awesome it is?
Yeah.

60
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,720
But a lot,
a lot exoticness ketones don't fuck with

61
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:44,310
never done ever exhaust.
Ah,

62
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,540
did I try it once?
I think I did,

63
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,910
I was told that it would like help with 
the headache and I was like,

64
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:49,070
I call bullshit.
Oh,

65
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,840
okay.
For like the Keto flu.

66
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,460
Uh,
it wasn't when I had,

67
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:56,220
I did have keto flu profoundly.
Uh,

68
00:02:56,221 --> 00:03:01,221
but that's what happens when you're a 
dumb ass the first time that you try 

69
00:03:01,221 --> 00:03:01,221
going ketogenic.

70
00:03:01,221 --> 00:03:01,330
How did you,
uh,

71
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,360
what'd you do?
I went true four to one after a three 

72
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:06,360
day.
Fast forward to one.

73
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,831
Explain that to people.
So for every gram of combined protein 

74
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:11,810
and carbohydrate,
I ate.

75
00:03:11,811 --> 00:03:14,710
I ate four grams of fat,
which is brutally difficult to do.

76
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:19,711
You never going to do it by accident.
I had a spreadsheet and everything that 

77
00:03:19,711 --> 00:03:21,730
I ate had to go through the math.
So I had to figure out like,

78
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:24,320
what's this going to be as a total meal?
Uh,

79
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:29,321
you,
you literally have to like scrape every 

80
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:29,470
bit of oil out of the pan.
Like you've got to be hardcore sop up.

81
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:34,471
Like if you've got cabbage or something,
sop up all the oil to make sure that 

82
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:34,471
you're getting it all.
It was hateful.

83
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:39,301
I absolutely hated.
It was so disgusting and dom has talked 

84
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:39,670
about that.
The palatability afforded one is very,

85
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:42,370
very low at the time I thought I needed 
to do that.

86
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,320
I was trying to do cancer prevention.
Uh,

87
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,360
so I went hard hardcore Quito trying to 
get the ratio between my blood glucose 

88
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,360
and my ketones.
Right.

89
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,860
Were you experiencing health 
difficulties?

90
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,640
Uh,
no.

91
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:56,641
So,
but at quest we were really trying to 

92
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:58,381
like experiment,
like find out what's the edge of this 

93
00:03:58,381 --> 00:03:58,381
stuff.
We were putting millions of dollars into

94
00:03:58,381 --> 00:03:59,250
research,
especially into cancer.

95
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:04,570
I'm trying to find out like,
does a ketogenic diet have the positive 

96
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,410
implications on cancer that we hope it 
does?

97
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,680
And um,
at least in a clip that I saw on your 

98
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:10,680
show when dom was on,
he was talking about that the,

99
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,631
um,
the enter the energy crisis that the 

100
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:16,180
cells go through that are cancerous 
because some forms of cancer.

101
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:17,030
Yeah,
there's,

102
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,820
there's some funny thing.
It's all of them.

103
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,990
I know some people are.
There was an article recently about 

104
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,671
brain cancer.
There was a type of brain cancer that 

105
00:04:26,671 --> 00:04:26,671
actually lived off of fat,
um,

106
00:04:26,671 --> 00:04:28,150
that didn't respond to a low carb diet.

107
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,830
I mean,
I believe there's several different 

108
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,630
kinds of cancer and so I don't know if 
all the data's in on that.

109
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,690
Right.
So your idea was just to do it just to 

110
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,090
get yourself in a really healthy state 
and monitor your own.

111
00:04:41,091 --> 00:04:42,490
Yeah.
My thing was like if,

112
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,820
if it has that potential,
it's worth trying.

113
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:46,750
Right.
What's the three day fast,

114
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:49,020
not a big deal.
And then two weeks of being in Ketosis,

115
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:54,030
going into it.
I didn't know how hard it was going to 

116
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:54,030
be.
I didn't know what four to one was going

117
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:54,820
to feel like and I didn't know how to 
supplement.

118
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:58,270
So it was,
it was real misery and I really did have

119
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:00,460
what they call the Keto flu.
You feel like you have the flu.

120
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:05,461
It's sucked.
And my whole thing is like being uber 

121
00:05:05,461 --> 00:05:05,500
discipline.
So once I commit to something,

122
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:10,501
I'm not going to stop just because it 
sucks and I wasn't smart enough to go 

123
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:10,690
and ask somebody.

124
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,890
Like,
what do you do?

125
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,040
Like,
is there a way to supplement your way 

126
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,040
out of this?
Uh,

127
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,040
so I just muscled through,
but it was total misery.

128
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,460
Find it.
I don't understand why you never tried 

129
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:21,460
exogenous ketones.
That doesn't make a lot of sales.

130
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:21,880
So,
you know Peter Attia,

131
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:22,930
right?
No,

132
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,730
you don't know Peter Attia.
Who is it?

133
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,080
You have to immediately get them on your
show.

134
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:29,050
So Peter Attia is a good friend of 
dominic d'agostino.

135
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,290
So that would be an easy connect.
And he's a doctor,

136
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,510
a physician.
Um,

137
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,400
he did a ted talk which crushed 
absolutely amazing.

138
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,730
And he goes from practicing traditional 
medicine.

139
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:41,530
And this is his ted talks.
This isn't me,

140
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:46,531
this is him saying it being fairly 
judgmental about the people that just 

141
00:05:46,531 --> 00:05:48,380
treating this woman comes in,
she has diabetes and um,

142
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,490
Oh God,
I think she was either there to have an 

143
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:53,590
amputation or she'd already had won 
something.

144
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,590
Anyway,
he realizes and as he starts all this 

145
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,140
down to this is like a human being and 
he,

146
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,790
what they're doing isn't solving the 
problem.

147
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:06,791
So he's like somewhere the system is 
failing a lot of people and how do we 

148
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:06,791
rectify it?
And,

149
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,920
and as he's giving the Ted talk,
he starts like crying is so amazing,

150
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,680
especially getting to know him and 
knowing that it's totally sincere.

151
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:17,681
This is not a guy faking it for the 
camera and so ends up completely 

152
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:18,590
changing his life.
He starts,

153
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,110
I'm really trying to figure out what's 
going on.

154
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:26,111
Metabolically finds high-fat finds 
ketogenics for awhile was known as the 

155
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:28,070
the fat man or the Quito man.
I forget what they call them,

156
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,010
but long before I'd ever heard of 
ketogenics and starts new,

157
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:38,100
see you heard a new nutritional science 
initiative raises a ton of money and 

158
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:43,931
they're trying to do like real 
double-blind empirical studies on 

159
00:06:43,931 --> 00:06:43,931
nutrition because they're like,
eh,

160
00:06:43,931 --> 00:06:45,650
like there's so much guesswork in all of
this.

161
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,440
We really want to prove it ends up 
leaving that.

162
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:53,441
I don't,
I won't speak to why I honestly don't 

163
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:53,441
know,
but ends up leaving new.

164
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:55,220
See I'm founding a private practice as 
like a high end concierge guy.

165
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,770
We were trying to get them involved at 
quest just because his,

166
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,040
nutritionally this guy's mind is unreal.
And so talking to him about that stuff 

167
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:06,860
and him walking us through like Keto flu
and how you can actually supplement your

168
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:11,861
way out of it and all that.
But I unfortunately didn't know it at 

169
00:07:11,861 --> 00:07:11,861
the time.
Uh,

170
00:07:11,861 --> 00:07:12,710
so yeah,
I suffered needlessly.

171
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,330
So,
um,

172
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,850
that's the flu thing is a weird feeling,
right?

173
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:20,570
Because your body just feels so weak and
you don't understand it.

174
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:23,420
You'd be eating and you,
you almost learned denial.

175
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:25,520
Like I can't believe that this is just 
carbs.

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,070
There's no way.
Like this is something something's going

177
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:28,430
on.

178
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,710
Is it carves or is it protein?
I mean I guess gluconeogenesis is 

179
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,110
turning the protein into glucose but it 
is weird.

180
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:41,140
Or is it that and this.
I actually don't know the answer to and 

181
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,151
that.
And I'm now outside my realm of what I 

182
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:44,151
understand.
So full disclosure,

183
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:48,100
but there's obviously something in the 
micro nutrients because the people that 

184
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,800
later told me you could have 
supplemented your way out of this.

185
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,690
They were talking about,
and I don't remember well,

186
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:52,370
but it was like magnesium and some other
things.

187
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,170
It wasn't,
oh,

188
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:54,760
just,
you know,

189
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,800
have more carbs or more protein,
but I will say at a two to one diet you 

190
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,660
at least I didn't experience the flu at 
all and that was sustainable and I did 

191
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,090
that for nine months and that was 
amazing.

192
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:10,091
It was transformative from an anti 
inflammatory perspective is just 

193
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:10,091
unbelievable.

194
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:14,140
So just more low carb than Quito total.
So I've been low carb for a very long 

195
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:18,701
time because I,
if I am having a cheat weekend and you 

196
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:19,550
were talking about this just before we 
went live,

197
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,330
if I'm having a cheat way can be raw.
You can hear me getting fatter.

198
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,510
Like it is so crazy how well my body 
turns a calorie into adipose tissue.

199
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:32,130
It's nuts.
So fatter.

200
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,950
Quicker.
I get fat very,

201
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:36,290
very fast,
especially with carbohydrate.

202
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,480
Um,
but even if I spiked my calories and 

203
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:41,480
they're all clean,
I'll get fat fast.

204
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,070
Wow.
And this didn't used to be the case 

205
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:45,640
before you tried these low carb diets.
Now this is always the case always.

206
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,120
Oh,
so yeah,

207
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,190
it wasn't until.
Yeah,

208
00:08:47,191 --> 00:08:48,670
yeah.
That's why I tried low carb.

209
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:52,370
So I'm so frustrated with always being 
like having a wet look,

210
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,580
a wet look.

211
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,030
What's that?
Uh,

212
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,260
maybe I'm making that up.
So that's what my partners and I used to

213
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:02,040
refer to people like me who just have a 
natural smooth layer of fat,

214
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:07,041
like I have to,
I have to do so much cardio to get that 

215
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,040
like dry look where you just really 
tight,

216
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,190
like a massive amount of cardio.
And is that the case even with a,

217
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,500
like a low carb diet,
like when you get to lean on a low carb 

218
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,550
diet to be sure,
but it doesn't.

219
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:22,470
Like if I want to be lean,
lean,

220
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,560
I have to do cardio.
So you're essentially got a really good 

221
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:27,890
adaptation body for famine,
yell,

222
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,210
I'll survive a famine.
The Zombie apocalypse.

223
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,160
I've got you.
Like I'm making it through that.

224
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,010
Very confident.
Do you watch walking dead?

225
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:36,480
Because a lot of people that think 
they're gonna make it.

226
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:40,200
They don't make them in a way behind.

227
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,690
I'm on like seasoned.
Where'd you stop?

228
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:45,270
Because people are telling me I'm going 
to jump on when they killed Glen.

229
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,460
Oh Wow.
It's a spoiler alert.

230
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,140
I guess,
right?

231
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,490
Uh,
I made it that far.

232
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,800
I made it that far,
but yeah,

233
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,760
now we're beyond that.
So.

234
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:58,761
But here's what I find interesting about
that is I want to do like some content 

235
00:09:58,761 --> 00:10:02,270
on what are,
like the 10 leadership lessons you can 

236
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:02,280
learn from the walking dead because I 
think they're,

237
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:04,290
they're like,
that's what I find interesting about the

238
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,660
show.
Rick is inconsistent.

239
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,980
I'm not buying them in this last season.
That's why I bailed out.

240
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,360
I don't know man.
I mean,

241
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:17,361
what,
what leadership thinks you're going to 

242
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:17,361
learn when everyone's turned to shit and
a bunch of people killing each other.

243
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:22,340
All right,
so let's go to one that you would have 

244
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:22,740
seen because before Glenn dies,
you've got the kid,

245
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:24,460
they find them at the bar,
the guy,

246
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,580
his team mates,
I don't have a better word for that is 

247
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:29,580
clan.

248
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:29,580
Whatever.
They go ballistic.

249
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,800
They start shooting.
You take back to your place and you want

250
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,220
to help him.
He failed his leg.

251
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:33,880
He's hurt.
Do you kill them?

252
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,100
Do you set them free?
What do you do?

253
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,340
A Web TV show.
It's not real.

254
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,850
You have to be a really around the guy.
You'd have to know.

255
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,810
Right.
You know,

256
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,260
I think it's part logic and part 
instinct when you're dealing with a 

257
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,740
situation like that,
like how much of this guy's behavior was

258
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:53,130
because he was stuck with a bunch of 
other shitty people and how different is

259
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:58,131
he when he's free and how much does he 
listen to reason and logic and how much 

260
00:10:58,131 --> 00:10:59,790
is he willing to contemplate the 
possibility that there's a better life.

261
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,940
Everybody works together.
If not kill them.

262
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,970
You don't want.
If you think that he's imaginably 

263
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:08,520
damaged,
like maybe he's a big liar,

264
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:10,320
he lies about a lot of stuff and you 
know,

265
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:11,310
you can't count on him.

266
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,910
You know he's going to be a liability 
and he's not going to be an asset and he

267
00:11:14,911 --> 00:11:17,220
might very well tried to kill you in 
your sleep or something like that.

268
00:11:17,221 --> 00:11:17,880
Yeah.
You got to kill him.

269
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,810
Right?
Yeah.

270
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:24,050
That's what I find interesting about the
show is that it makes you think about 

271
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,050
stuff like that.
Let me ask you this.

272
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,890
If something does happen,
like asteroidal impact,

273
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:30,891
right?
And there's only like 10 percent of the 

274
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,961
people left.
Do you want to be amongst those 10 

275
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:32,961
percent of the people or would you 
rather be one of the people that died?

276
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,650
Wow,
that seems like a trick question.

277
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,270
I want to be one of the 10 percent.
Like,

278
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,670
can I just say,
have you read the stand by?

279
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,930
No,
no dude,

280
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:41,090
you would love it.
Yeah.

281
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,070
So it's about your super flew,
right?

282
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,850
So wipes out,
let's say it's 10 percent.

283
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:47,910
I don't remember what the number is,
but it wipes out virtually everybody.

284
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,610
And then the remaining people have the 
task of rebuilding society analysis,

285
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,800
Stephen King novels.
So there's a lot of weird shit going on.

286
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,930
But that captured my imagination so 
profoundly when I read it,

287
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,960
I read it probably 15 years old,
dude.

288
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:04,150
I still think about that.
I think that would,

289
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:09,151
while I wouldn't want it,
because inevitably a lot of people that 

290
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:09,470
you love end up being in the 90 percent 
us,

291
00:12:09,471 --> 00:12:11,480
so that would suck.
Um,

292
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:16,060
but if it happened it would be 
fascinating to see how we rebuild.

293
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,300
But if you've seen the road,
that's a pretty dark take on what 

294
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:21,300
happens.
But yeah,

295
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,370
I'm a little more optimistically.
I mean,

296
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:28,380
look,
it could be wonderful if you really can 

297
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,051
survive and you really find a way to 
live off the land and you find a good 

298
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:34,051
group of people and you all work in 
coordination and he cooperate and you 

299
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:38,641
have a wonderful little civilization.
Take care of each other or if you get 

300
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:42,490
horribly ugly and then you could be 
dealing with the cannibals and marauders

301
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:46,390
and people invading you and where,
where do you fall?

302
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,030
But what do you mean 90 percent?
Ten percent.

303
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,520
Oh,
100 percent or 90 percent really.

304
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,510
I mean,
they have with that rock.

305
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,890
Wow.
I'll call this dude.

306
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,920
That's interesting.
And you don't want to be one of those 

307
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:58,920
survivors when there's nothing left.
You know,

308
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,590
you don't want to be dealing with people
seeing if you can eat it.

309
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:01,490
Charred foot,
you know,

310
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,520
because you're super starving.
Well,

311
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:05,500
put,
just,

312
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:06,580
um,
I mean,

313
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:11,581
maybe it's a copout look,
the only reason why we're here is 

314
00:13:11,581 --> 00:13:11,581
because monkeys fucked when they were 
living in trees,

315
00:13:11,581 --> 00:13:16,460
you know?
And they figured out a way to get to 

316
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,350
become a person over who knows how many 
millions of generations or whatever it's

317
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:20,260
been.
But I think if you really stop and think

318
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:25,261
about what your life would be,
if everybody out there was dead and 

319
00:13:25,261 --> 00:13:26,380
there was only like 10 percent of people
that first of all,

320
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:27,340
90 percent of the people dead.

321
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,310
That's a lot of stinking rotten bodies.
You've got to get through that.

322
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,430
How it's going to be awful.
There's going to be 10 percent.

323
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:38,460
What's the odds that any fuckers know 
how to work electricity or know how to 

324
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,880
get a generator going or know how to re 
up a power plant.

325
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,110
Like what if a power plant goes down?
What if uh,

326
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,430
the grid is down,
you need to fix a car.

327
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,980
Do you even understand how a car works?
Like most people don't?

328
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Ten percent.
If you could get really unlucky and get 

329
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,970
10 percent of the people who don't know 
shit and they're just looking for a job.

330
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,920
Yup.
Those are the people that survive.

331
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,840
No question.
If that's the case,

332
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,070
you might not make it.
Do you know the,

333
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,820
the united,
the United States,

334
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:10,720
but the human population got down to a 
thing they think is low as like,

335
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:16,770
I want to say 7,000
people at one point in time after the 

336
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:17,710
eruption of a or something like the 
Super Volcano.

337
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:22,950
Yeah.
There was some super volcano eruption 

338
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,051
that.
There's a theory that it dropped the 

339
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:28,260
human population down to an unbelievably
low level and it was not that long ago 

340
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,710
either.
I think it was like 60,000

341
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:31,080
years ago or something like that.
Well,

342
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,160
I didn't know that.
The timing,

343
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,240
but yeah,
I had heard that,

344
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,010
which is pretty fascinating.
Not Good.

345
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,530
Not good if that's real 60,000
years ago.

346
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,210
Especially when you think of genetic 
diversity.

347
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:41,710
That's really terrifying.
Yeah.

348
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:43,570
Maybe that accounts for a lot of our 
fuckups,

349
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,340
you know,
it's interesting too.

350
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:47,290
And they also,
they keep finding these new humans,

351
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,940
you know,
like fossilized.

352
00:14:48,941 --> 00:14:49,840
You're talking about.
Yeah,

353
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,040
like new humans that they didn't know 
existed.

354
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,350
Like they found one in Russia fairly 
recently,

355
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:59,351
like an offshoot of humans.
Like we just Kinda got lucky to make it 

356
00:14:59,351 --> 00:15:00,430
to this that,
you know,

357
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,420
not read Homo Deus.
No.

358
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,900
So Noah,
you've all Harare also wrote sapiens.

359
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:09,230
He talks about that sort of thing in 
both of his books.

360
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:12,230
Like how is it luck?
What do we have?

361
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:15,230
Like what made humans the Apex Predator 
and looking at,

362
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,780
you know,
our ability to be social.

363
00:15:17,781 --> 00:15:19,760
But where does that come from?
Like when you look at.

364
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:24,761
So the way that he ended up defining it 
is the reasons that humans become the 

365
00:15:24,761 --> 00:15:26,360
apex Predator is because unlike an ant,
which is actually very,

366
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:31,361
very impressive with how they can 
organize large number of hands beings,

367
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:33,560
whatever you were classified as,
um,

368
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:38,710
they can't do it flexibly.
So it's like we have sort of a pre 

369
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,290
written code and these are the things 
that we do and that's it.

370
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:44,290
And you fall in the line,
you go to food like you build the 

371
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,181
colonies is always the same way humans 
can organize and similarly large 

372
00:15:46,181 --> 00:15:46,460
numbers,
but they can do it flexibly.

373
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:48,860
So you can organize and watch a nascar 
race.

374
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:51,460
You can organize and fight a war.
You can organize and build a church like

375
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:56,650
whatever the ways that we want to 
organize and one of the things he says 

376
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,010
is at the heart of that is our ability 
to convey um,

377
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,670
kinship through something other than 
genetic relations.

378
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:02,500
So,
um,

379
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,360
what he refers to it as is like that,
the grand fiction,

380
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:08,180
the narrative that we tell each other,
which is often religion or whatever,

381
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,280
but it lets people who've never met 
like,

382
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,020
uh,
the way I always like to think of it.

383
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:17,021
Imagine two guys that meet each other 
and they both ride Harley's never ever 

384
00:16:17,021 --> 00:16:20,111
met,
but they click right because they share 

385
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:20,300
that thing which is a stand in for a 
belief system.

386
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,640
So that to me is pretty interesting as 
to whether like,

387
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,210
and,
and his hypothesis is the reason that we

388
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:30,290
ended up taking over neanderthals and 
all that was because because of that,

389
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,250
because we could organize using 
symbology using metaphor,

390
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,430
we were able to organize more flexibly 
in larger numbers and really be accurate

391
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:45,341
with how to attack and things like that 
so that we could eliminate to rival 

392
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,340
clan.
Oh,

393
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:47,810
totally makes sense.
I mean,

394
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:50,090
that's a,
it's one of the more fascinating aspects

395
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:50,990
of being a person,
right?

396
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:53,150
So we can assume so many different 
forms,

397
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,300
culture and behavior and the patterns 
that we follow.

398
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,370
But you gotta think if we got down with 
7,000

399
00:16:58,371 --> 00:16:59,420
people,
we're pretty lucky.

400
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,030
Pretty lucky.
If that was,

401
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,580
wasn't like a full wipe out.
I'm fucking terrified of yellowstone.

402
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,380
Well,
that's one of those,

403
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:10,580
as you look closely at it as like a.
I just pretend that that's not a threat.

404
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,620
I don't know what else to do.
There's nothing you can do,

405
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:13,820
but if it's.
If it goes,

406
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,260
it's a global one.
Look,

407
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:18,020
it's a real problem globally.
I mean it's locally,

408
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:20,240
it's a disaster,
but globally it's,

409
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:22,490
it's a real problem.
It's going to cloud the skies,

410
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:24,110
it's going to put us into a nuclear 
winter.

411
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:29,650
Those,
those big ones like the one that they 

412
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:29,650
think.
See,

413
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:29,720
did you find anything on that one?
What we.

414
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,030
Where was it a say?
Indonesia.

415
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:33,460
South Asia.

416
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

417
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,480
Something crazier on it too.
It said there's a couple of studies at 

418
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,751
how many people were left and instead 
there was roughly maybe a thousand 

419
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:44,380
reproductive adults,
some as low as 40 reproductive pairs,

420
00:17:44,381 --> 00:17:47,560
which it'd be like 80 people still be 
kids maybe,

421
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:49,820
but that's,
that's rough.

422
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,710
And the amount of Jesus Christ,
most likely there was a drastic dip.

423
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,800
And then 5,000
to 10,000

424
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:04,010
bedraggled homosapien struggled together
for a pitiful little clumps hunting and 

425
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,870
gathering for thousands of years until 
the late stone age.

426
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,450
Wow.
When we humans began to recover.

427
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:11,880
Holy Fuck.
But it was a time.

428
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:12,380
Hold on.
Sorry.

429
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,430
Um,
we didn't.

430
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,580
Damn near went extinct.
Wow.

431
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,520
So yes.
Seventy thousand BC.

432
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,740
So a little bit more than 70,000
years ago.

433
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,700
A volcano.
Hold on,

434
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,820
hold on.
A called Toba in Sumatra or in 

435
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,661
Indonesia?
Went off blowing roughly 650 miles of 

436
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:36,771
vaporized rock into the air.
It's the largest volcanic eruption we 

437
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:36,960
know of.
Dwarfing.

438
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:39,210
Everything else.
Holy Shit,

439
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,630
man.
That's comparison to.

440
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,710
Wow,
that's interesting to see that you see 

441
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,650
Mount Saint Helens,
the amount of ejected material versus.

442
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,490
Wow.
So,

443
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,320
so it got down to as low as 40 mating 
pairs.

444
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,480
Studies suggest that?
Yeah.

445
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,720
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

446
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,720
I mean we're just at the whim of the 
natural forces that make mountains and 

447
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,970
there's a giant volcano called Dara 
volcano under yellowstone and I think 

448
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,850
like a week ago they had something like 
1500 earthquakes wasn't like some,

449
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,040
some she's taken like a month and a 
month period of time.

450
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:17,240
They,
they,

451
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:22,250
they,
it was like really recently they talked 

452
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,921
about this,
how many earthquakes they had over a 

453
00:19:24,921 --> 00:19:26,190
very short period of time.
That just constant and consistent.

454
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:32,430
Just crazy in June.
It's at 400.

455
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,660
Okay.
There was something in,

456
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,290
uh,
I believe it was in July.

457
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,450
It was another one like really recently.
But you know,

458
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:44,451
that just that kind of shit that there 
can be 400 earthquakes and a month like 

459
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:47,300
what?
Eight hundred and 78 weeks later.

460
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,570
That's it.
That's the thing.

461
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:52,230
I was looking at 878 earthquakes in two 
weeks.

462
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:57,610
Does what it was.
So it's like 1200 plus earthquakes in a 

463
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:02,630
month and two weeks for four.

464
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,650
And that's not much small earthquake.
But it's the idea that there are so 

465
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,000
significant volcanic activity under 
something that we didn't even know was a

466
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:15,780
volcano until like,
I want to say like a decade or two ago,

467
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,890
they use satellite imagery to figure it 
out that it was called Dara.

468
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,390
They didn't even know it is that you 
can,

469
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,430
you can't see it until you get far 
enough up that you really started to see

470
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,130
greater.
That's what's nuts.

471
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,080
Yeah.
They realized what it is.

472
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,170
It must've been like a horror movie when
they pulled back and went,

473
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,850
oh my God,
Oh my God.

474
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,460
It's like that scene in a twilight zone 
and to serve man.

475
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:40,770
It's a cookbook.
I haven't seen that.

476
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,590
Never seen that one.
A precious few,

477
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,560
um,
twilight zones to be honest,

478
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,370
to serve.
It's one of the best ones.

479
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,480
Yeah.
It's a bunch of aliens.

480
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,900
Come down here.
Spoiler alert for 1950 bucks.

481
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,650
But they come down here and they realize
that they,

482
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,400
they,
they,

483
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,970
somewhere along the line people realize 
that there's something going on and that

484
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:04,720
they're taking these people board their 
spaceship and they're not coming back.

485
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:09,550
And then at the end they've left this 
book and the book they thought to serve,

486
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:12,460
man,
God was like they wanted to serve us.

487
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:15,580
It turns out it's a cookbook,
but too late,

488
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:17,560
they're already bored spaceship ready to
get eaten.

489
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,340
It's dope to the twilight zone.
Has some awesome endings.

490
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,460
I have to give it that.
Well,

491
00:21:21,461 --> 00:21:25,600
they had such a bounty of premises.
The premises are incredible.

492
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,030
Only to this day,
if you stop and think about all the,

493
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,540
you remember William Shatner with the 
agility that the.

494
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,510
See that one where there was like a,
I think I've seen like three and I don't

495
00:21:34,511 --> 00:21:35,110
remember them.

496
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,930
He went to a diner and there was a place
that he,

497
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:42,931
uh,
was at that had like one of those 

498
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:42,931
little,
um,

499
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:47,340
like a fortune teller box.
It was like these tabs jukeboxes that 

500
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,790
were in d.
do you ever see a jukebox in a diner?

501
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

502
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:53,080
So like you'd be sitting at a table and 
you can actually control the music.

503
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:58,410
This thing that you're seeing up there,
he had a fortune teller and you would 

504
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:02,520
put in a cent or one cent coin and ask 
him a question,

505
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:07,550
yes or no question.
It would give you answers and he became 

506
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,961
obsessed with it.
I started started fucking with them and 

507
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,170
it was like it was getting too close to 
reality as I say.

508
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:12,830
Is it coming true?
Like is he.

509
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,190
Yeah.
I don't want to give away any spoilers,

510
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,650
but it was just a great show man.

511
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,690
I mean just they tried to bring it back.
Right,

512
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:22,030
but I think it tanked.
Wouldn't they try to bring it back?

513
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:27,620
God,
I want to say early nineties that I can 

514
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,810
be way off on the date,
but was that.

515
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,850
They definitely tried to bring it back 
without rod sterling.

516
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:35,851
It's going to be tough and I wonder how 
many of them were actually written by 

517
00:22:35,851 --> 00:22:38,671
Rod Sterling.
A good question because he was always a 

518
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:42,211
host of it.
Imagine if he was just a host and it 

519
00:22:42,211 --> 00:22:42,211
really didn't have nothing to do with 
it.

520
00:22:42,211 --> 00:22:43,150
I brought it back in the eighties and 
nineties.

521
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,460
Really?
Yeah.

522
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,410
It's hard when you get something like 
that,

523
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:49,360
first of all,
you've got to pay a lot for it because I

524
00:22:49,361 --> 00:22:54,361
know that was one of the reasons why 
they switched over the tower of terror 

525
00:22:54,361 --> 00:22:58,171
ride at Disneyland to guardians of the 
galaxy was that they couldn't come to a 

526
00:22:58,391 --> 00:23:01,360
licensing agreement with the twilight 
zone.

527
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,470
Really?
Yeah.

528
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:07,920
Because the tower of terror ride was 
always about the twilight zone with rod 

529
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,940
sterling would come out in the beginning
of it and that was the whole.

530
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,880
The whole ride was about this haunted 
tower,

531
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:18,210
you know,
when you get into it and it just takes 

532
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,900
you to this crazy fucking ride and they 
somehow or another couldn't come to some

533
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:24,901
sort of a deal.
So they decided to turn it into the 

534
00:23:24,901 --> 00:23:24,901
guardians of the galaxy.
Rod Seems,

535
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,460
uh,
if you have a deal with Disney,

536
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,820
you know,
seems like you'd want to keep that rock 

537
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:32,820
and roll.
Keep that dude.

538
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,970
Somebody's got greedy.
I would agree with that.

539
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,100
That's a big part of business,
isn't it?

540
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,130
Somebody just gets a little crazy.
It was a little too much.

541
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:42,370
Adderall fits a little fired up.
It gets cocky.

542
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,400
Yeah,
you'd be surprised how often that 

543
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:47,400
happens behind doors.
Entrepreneurship

544
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:47,400
is,
it gets weird.

545
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,420
It's like you were,
you just dealing with,

546
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,600
going back to your point about these are
monkeys that learned how to have sex and

547
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:54,500
then do something,
uh,

548
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,740
you feel that sometimes.
Also I would imagine being an 

549
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,821
entrepreneur,
like organizing a team of people that 

550
00:24:03,821 --> 00:24:06,470
are going to work together in harmony 
and not stab each other in the back,

551
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,110
not trip each other up with office 
politics,

552
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,320
not getting away with a bunch of 
bullshit social issues between each 

553
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,230
other.
Like how do you structure that?

554
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,140
Like,
I mean I can't imagine what it'd be like

555
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:23,141
to run a significant business and have a
lot of it being dependent upon the way 

556
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:25,220
that people in the office that you don't
even know.

557
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,240
Yes.
Hire them the way they interact with 

558
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,240
each other.
Yeah.

559
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,891
So one,
you have to get really good at thin 

560
00:24:32,891 --> 00:24:32,891
slicing people.

561
00:24:32,891 --> 00:24:36,010
You have to be able to very rapidly 
identify like are these going to be 

562
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,310
people that are gonna make this a better
place to work?

563
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:39,590
Which is one of the things that I think 
is most important,

564
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:44,591
like,
forget or they go to their job that's 

565
00:24:44,591 --> 00:24:44,591
important to you,
got to know that,

566
00:24:44,591 --> 00:24:45,050
but are they going to make this a better
place to work?

567
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:50,140
And some of the biggest mistakes I made 
in my career have been keeping people 

568
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,921
because they were good at their job even
though they were toxic to the 

569
00:24:53,921 --> 00:24:54,080
environment,
walking dead type scenario,

570
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,290
coming back and telling you like there 
are any other lessons that you can learn

571
00:24:57,291 --> 00:25:01,640
about entrepreneurship and stuff like 
that where it from pop culture.

572
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,150
So yeah,
that,

573
00:25:03,151 --> 00:25:05,480
that would be one of them.
That was really intense.

574
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,190
Uh,
figuring that one out.

575
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:12,191
That was a hard lesson.
And then knowing when your businesses 

576
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:12,191
transition.

577
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:12,191
So in the beginning you're a startup,
nobody knows who you are,

578
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:17,171
you don't have enough revenue.
So you need people that are going to 

579
00:25:17,171 --> 00:25:17,171
just bust ass.
They're gonna come in,

580
00:25:17,171 --> 00:25:19,010
they're going to be hardcore hustlers,
get it done.

581
00:25:19,011 --> 00:25:20,450
Whatever it takes.
Two am on a Friday,

582
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:23,300
they are going to be there for you.
But then at some point,

583
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:28,301
and the reason by the way that you're,
that you can make that exchange is you 

584
00:25:28,301 --> 00:25:28,610
can't pay them a lot.
They don't have a lot of skills.

585
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,830
So what they have to offer is they're 
willing to work hard.

586
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:33,980
So you're essentially throwing human 
capital at whatever problems you have.

587
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:39,370
Now,
if you get the right people motivated 

588
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:39,370
and you're a lead from the front kind of
guy.

589
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:43,240
Like when we first started quest,
I was wearing a hairnet everyday lab 

590
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:43,240
coat.
I was making protein bars,

591
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,500
but I would walk in and say what's the 
worst job?

592
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,000
And whatever.
The Guy said,

593
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:48,680
this is the worst job today.
It's a little sticky,

594
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:50,360
whatever.
So this station is actually the worst.

595
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,720
So I would take that station and I would
rock it with a smile on my face.

596
00:25:53,721 --> 00:25:55,100
I will be upbeat,
energetic,

597
00:25:55,101 --> 00:26:00,101
and I would just outwork everybody.
And the reason I did that was I knew 

598
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:01,610
when the day came that it was going to 
be a Friday at 2:00

599
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,870
AM and they're all gonna want to go home
and.

600
00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:07,871
But we've got to get this batch done 
that no one would ever question my work 

601
00:26:07,871 --> 00:26:07,940
ethic.
So when I said,

602
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,140
guys,
I need you to stay,

603
00:26:09,141 --> 00:26:10,820
like they would be there.
Um,

604
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,880
also because of where we were when 
you're in manufacturing,

605
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:18,881
you're inevitably in the inner cities,
the only place you can afford that kind 

606
00:26:18,881 --> 00:26:21,341
of real estate.
So we were hiring from the surrounding 

607
00:26:21,341 --> 00:26:21,341
neighborhoods.

608
00:26:21,341 --> 00:26:24,510
So we're literally in Compton hiring 
people that grew up in the inner cities 

609
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:27,830
hardcore.
And I remember my first lesson in hope 

610
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,420
and one of the guys came up to me was 
just killing himself.

611
00:26:30,421 --> 00:26:33,830
He's doing such an amazing job and just 
always working,

612
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:35,360
putting in the hours,
doing whatever it takes.

613
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:36,530
And he came up to me one day and he 
said,

614
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:39,110
you know,
you care more about my success in my own

615
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:40,340
mother.
And he was like,

616
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,790
I never had a vision of my future.
I didn't want to look at it.

617
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:49,791
It was because his sister had been shot 
to death in the heart with an AK 47 in 

618
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:51,180
his front yard when she was like 12.
So it,

619
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:56,181
it's just,
there's so many stories like that you 

620
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,311
can imagine.
Another guy held his father while he 

621
00:26:58,311 --> 00:26:58,311
bled to death from a gunshot wound to 
the head.

622
00:26:58,311 --> 00:26:58,311
I mean,
just nuts.

623
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,240
And so hearing him say that,
I was like,

624
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,840
he was saying it as a way to explain why
he was so committed,

625
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:07,440
why he was working so hard because 
basically he didn't use these words,

626
00:27:07,441 --> 00:27:11,310
but basically I've never had hope before
and this is really fucking exciting.

627
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,640
So.
But then understanding where does that 

628
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:16,640
transition,
right?

629
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:16,640
Where do you go from,
okay,

630
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,811
I need a bunch of hustlers.
We don't have the money to throw at 

631
00:27:20,811 --> 00:27:24,141
really skilled labor,
so I need to throw it at people that'll 

632
00:27:24,141 --> 00:27:24,141
just work really,
really hard.

633
00:27:24,141 --> 00:27:26,100
But then at some point it's what I call 
the dragon begins to eat its own tail.

634
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,280
So you're growing so fast,
you're getting so big that without the 

635
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,280
systems,
without professional management in place

636
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,120
like you,
you just can't get bigger because people

637
00:27:33,121 --> 00:27:35,580
start stepping on each other's toes.
It starts getting confusing.

638
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:40,580
The leadership isn't close enough to 
everybody that that sort of do or 

639
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:40,710
diamond tells you that they would see in
me.

640
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:43,020
They would see me on the line,
they would see how I would work.

641
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,460
It's not there anymore.
Right?

642
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:49,461
So now there's layers between you and it
started to fall apart that that was a 

643
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:50,070
hard lesson.
So realizing that,

644
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:55,071
Whoa,
like I've got to now start bringing in 

645
00:27:55,071 --> 00:27:57,501
professional managers actually know what
they're doing that have done this 

646
00:27:57,501 --> 00:28:00,441
before,
built out production studios or 

647
00:28:00,441 --> 00:28:01,440
manufacturing so that we can really do 
it right.

648
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:03,510
That we can put systems in place to take
care of people.

649
00:28:03,511 --> 00:28:06,090
But then you get bureaucracy which is 
like a nightmare,

650
00:28:06,091 --> 00:28:08,910
especially for the hustlers.
So then they feel disenfranchised,

651
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,120
but it's the only way for you to grow 
and how do you deal with all of that 

652
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,120
shit.
So yeah,

653
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,120
it is weird.

654
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,710
I've got to imagine also like you want 
the people that are working for you to 

655
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,820
have some sort of a stake in the success
of the business.

656
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:24,150
So like organizing that.
It's got to be difficult.

657
00:28:24,151 --> 00:28:27,330
Like how much of a percentage of the 
business do you give to the workers?

658
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:31,800
Like you have to make to incentivize 
them to like really innovate and there's

659
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:33,240
got to be something on the line for 
them.

660
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:34,170
They would.
There was something,

661
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,150
some sort of reward I would imagine.
Right.

662
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,140
Will you be shocked how many people 
don't agree with that?

663
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Now I'm with you and to me it's.
And I guess it's what's the argument 

664
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,640
against it that you're not gonna get 
anything for it,

665
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,240
that it's nice in idea,
but they won't actually work harder.

666
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:52,950
They won't work smarter.
They just.

667
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,150
They're not in a position to bring 
benefit from getting that,

668
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,240
but here's what all this is the argument
I've always given to people that say 

669
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,881
that it you're not going to get the 
benefit from them maybe that you would 

670
00:29:04,881 --> 00:29:04,881
get from you.

671
00:29:04,881 --> 00:29:09,830
Like I get equity is triggering you in a
certain way and you've got a certain 

672
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:09,960
skillset and so you can execute against 
that,

673
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:14,961
but especially now from millennials down
the sense of working for the man,

674
00:29:16,261 --> 00:29:21,261
working for some other.
Like there's no stability in that 

675
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:24,051
equation anymore.
You used to trade 40 years of your life 

676
00:29:24,051 --> 00:29:26,601
because you could just kind of count on 
the fact that you would be there for 40 

677
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:26,601
years.
Those days are gone,

678
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:30,801
man.
People spend something like one point 

679
00:29:30,801 --> 00:29:33,380
eight years or something at a given job 
and then they move on the best way to 

680
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:33,380
get a raise as the jumped to another 
company.

681
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,520
So millennials do they jump around 
around,

682
00:29:35,521 --> 00:29:37,410
around.
So there's no longer this like,

683
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,780
Hey,
I'm,

684
00:29:38,781 --> 00:29:41,130
I'm going to give you stability and 
you're going to give me like,

685
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,940
uh,
an adequate level of performance.

686
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:43,870
So those days are gone.

687
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,720
Now.
My thing with ownership is one,

688
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:51,780
tie it to being there until an exit.
So that what I'm trying to incentivize 

689
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,200
as you taking me all the way across the 
finish line,

690
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:54,460
so if you don't take me across the 
finish line,

691
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:55,870
you don't get anything.
Fair enough.

692
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,200
And then on top of that,
just the sense of really being able to 

693
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,690
say I own a piece of this company is so 
empowering for people,

694
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,300
especially for people for whom that's 
never been an option.

695
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,530
Maybe it was never an option for their 
parents like they,

696
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,490
they've never even heard of a company 
doing something like that.

697
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:16,150
Being able to go to literally the lowest
person on the totem pole and say,

698
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:18,250
I'm going to give you,
it's going to be small obviously,

699
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:21,430
but I'm going to give you some 
percentage ownership in this company and

700
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:23,650
now literally we're all owners.

701
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:28,710
So you have like the most selfish 
incentive to make this company 

702
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,410
successful.
Ever.

703
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,870
Now where this gets tricky.
Can I ask you to go to stop?

704
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,730
You were there.
What,

705
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,640
what is across the finish line to sell a
company so IPO,

706
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:39,090
right?
So you either seller IPO and I was going

707
00:30:39,091 --> 00:30:42,010
to say what gets tricky is like the 
company I'm building now,

708
00:30:42,011 --> 00:30:43,750
impact theory.
I don't plan to sell it.

709
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:48,990
What is that?
So impact theory is a traditional 

710
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:48,990
narrative studios.
So I think Disney.

711
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,310
So we're building the making movies,
TV shows,

712
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,680
comments.
You're building the next Disney.

713
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:54,580
How dare you?
Well,

714
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,160
bigger than Disneyland just to just to 
be honest,

715
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,290
I don't want to do that.
You're going to have a,

716
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,140
what do you call it again?
What's the name of it?

717
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,700
Uh,
impact theory.

718
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,070
You're going to have like impact theory 
land in Paris?

719
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:06,940
No,
probably not,

720
00:31:06,941 --> 00:31:11,941
but only because follow me here only 
because by the time that we'll be able 

721
00:31:11,941 --> 00:31:15,781
to do that,
so I'm going to need a similar time on 

722
00:31:15,781 --> 00:31:15,781
our m and e,
50 60 years to pull this off.

723
00:31:15,781 --> 00:31:19,000
I'm not spastic.
And by then virtual reality or augmented

724
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:24,001
reality,
it just won't make sense to build out 

725
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:24,001
the physical structures.
Right?

726
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:24,910
I guess some people want to rock it,
old school.

727
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:30,030
They do.
And we could really get into that about 

728
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,971
how the world's about to bifurcate and 
you're going to get between people who 

729
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:33,370
augment themselves.
Brain augmentation if people refuse to.

730
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,560
Do you read Fahrenheit 4:51?
No.

731
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,940
Oh Dude.
Cool part in the book.

732
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:41,970
All right,
so the world splits knowledge is 

733
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,041
dangerous.
So we just done books offhand and it 

734
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:44,470
creates a really stable society.
So most people are all for it.

735
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:46,840
But you have these people who are like,
fuck that,

736
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,130
like what I want to read.

737
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:53,250
You don't get to tell me what to think.
And so they move off into the woods and 

738
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,461
I remember reading that going,
I can actually see something like that 

739
00:31:56,461 --> 00:31:56,500
happening.
And I think the moment that that's gonna

740
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:59,650
happen is when humans begin to augment 
themselves,

741
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,620
not to overcome like cochlear implants.
You were deaf.

742
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:05,950
Everybody gets that.
I'm retinal replacements and things.

743
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:07,990
Okay,
you couldn't see people get that.

744
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,340
But when it becomes,
no,

745
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:09,610
no,
no,

746
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,640
I just want to raise my Iq.
I want to be able to process data 

747
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:14,640
faster.
That's when people are going to be like,

748
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,760
fuck that,
and you're going to get a bifurcation.

749
00:32:15,761 --> 00:32:16,810
Now,
how weird does it get?

750
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,190
Because now the reason I am convinced 
that people are going to do this,

751
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:24,250
ai is going to get real real fast.
Even if Real,

752
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:25,690
fastest,
50 years,

753
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:30,930
like it's gonna get really compelling 
and you're going to find people just to 

754
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:33,730
keep up with artificial intelligence.
You have to augment yourself.

755
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:37,020
Otherwise you just accept that this 
stuff is going to outpace you and I.

756
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,040
Well,
I guess I'm just a lowly human now,

757
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,100
so I think

758
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,110
it is going to have.
I don't think there's any question about

759
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:47,111
that,
but I also don't think there's any 

760
00:32:47,111 --> 00:32:47,111
question when that starts happening.
Some people will refuse.

761
00:32:47,111 --> 00:32:51,670
Well,
if we really do augment ourselves to 

762
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,670
keep up with artificial reality,
artificial reality is supposed to change

763
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:57,671
like 10,000
years of advancements in the first two 

764
00:32:57,671 --> 00:33:00,281
weeks once it starts augmenting itself.
Once artificial reality figures out how 

765
00:33:00,281 --> 00:33:03,560
to do a better job of creating 
artificial reality,

766
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:06,800
which is absolutely going to do if they 
can learn and actually create.

767
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,830
We're just talking about this with 
Brendan Schaub.

768
00:33:08,831 --> 00:33:11,510
It was in her earlier about the movie 
alien covenant.

769
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,640
We gave away.
Spoiler just see that movie.

770
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,480
I haven't.
Well,

771
00:33:14,481 --> 00:33:16,370
there's one of the things in.
There's these robots,

772
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,400
these artificially intelligent robots 
and they realized that giving them 

773
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,901
creativity was a huge mistake and so 
they don't have creativity and the new 

774
00:33:25,901 --> 00:33:25,901
models.

775
00:33:25,901 --> 00:33:30,490
It's really fascinating because if you 
do give some sort of an artificially 

776
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:33,140
intelligent creature thing,
whatever you wanna call it,

777
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:38,141
that you make.
Once it starts becoming sentient and 

778
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:38,810
creating things itself,
it's going to look at its own.

779
00:33:38,811 --> 00:33:43,811
Wiring's going to go,
why the fuck did you connect that to 

780
00:33:43,811 --> 00:33:43,811
that when you can just do it this way 
and why?

781
00:33:43,811 --> 00:33:45,770
Look at the zone code like with this 
pathway.

782
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,410
That's kind of redundant.
How about we just do it this way?

783
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,440
How about you open up that end of it.
How about people looking at things 

784
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:53,950
because they're worried about mortality 
and all these different know the room,

785
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:59,230
their own demise and the finality of 
death and this was all tripping them up 

786
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,340
and they really should be thinking about
this way and then boom,

787
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:03,710
they're off to the races and in a week,
two weeks,

788
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:05,600
three weeks there,
down the road.

789
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,510
Thousands of years of human evolution.
Yeah.

790
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,750
Have you heard about the facebook ai?
Yes.

791
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:12,830
Yes.
Fascinating.

792
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:17,831
Yeah.
They start talking in a new language 

793
00:34:17,831 --> 00:34:17,831
that nobody listened.
Nobody pulled the plug.

794
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,050
That was the first one that was like,
oh shit.

795
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:26,051
Like I didn't think of even the most 
simple ways that they could just rip 

796
00:34:26,051 --> 00:34:27,950
step to the side and like isis out.
You're,

797
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,480
you're absolutely right.
It's going to happen fast.

798
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:34,481
It's going to get weird questions.
Does it become the matrix or what does 

799
00:34:34,481 --> 00:34:34,880
it become?
Something unimaginable.

800
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,240
I mean it could be a real god and we 
really,

801
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:42,140
really could create and that's not a bad
use of the word and the term.

802
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,480
When you talk to you about artificial 
intelligence,

803
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:47,180
I think one of the problems with that as
we start thinking robot,

804
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,100
oh,
you make it an artificial robot,

805
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,710
you're making a system,
okay,

806
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:56,711
and this system has desires and this 
system has goals and it has.

807
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:03,040
If you're,
if you're somehow or another 

808
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,051
engineering,
the ability to create and innovate into 

809
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,020
this intelligence that we call it 
artificial all you want,

810
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:10,190
but it's real.
It's right there.

811
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,650
So I don't know what it is.
I don't know.

812
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,750
I think the problem with the term 
artificial reality was we start thinking

813
00:35:14,751 --> 00:35:19,751
about science fiction.
We start thinking about robots and 

814
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:22,181
things.
You're making a thing that thinks for 

815
00:35:22,181 --> 00:35:26,150
itself and it doesn't just do things 
like your computer does things.

816
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:26,430
No,
no,

817
00:35:26,431 --> 00:35:31,431
no.
This does things without you asking it 

818
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:33,581
to.
That's where shit gets super weird and 

819
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:34,850
then it starts examining.
If you give it the ability to create and

820
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:39,851
the desire to create,
it's going to start examining all the 

821
00:35:39,851 --> 00:35:43,611
different systems around it and 
replicating it and figuring out far 

822
00:35:43,611 --> 00:35:47,481
better solutions than our stupid little 
monkey mind is going to be able to do 

823
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:50,160
and within a decade or two decades,
we're probably,

824
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:52,560
if we do augment ourselves to keep up 
with it,

825
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,180
we're going to be unrecognizable.

826
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:59,180
We're going to be all locked into some 
gigantic worldwide wireless information 

827
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:05,010
hub where we're exchanging ideas and 
emotions with each other.

828
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:10,360
It's,
it's the having the access to 

829
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,401
information on demand like we do now is 
probably changing us in some really 

830
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:19,131
profound ways and we're not even aware 
of right now and the idea of this 

831
00:36:19,131 --> 00:36:22,590
becoming just a baby step and some 
infinite journey.

832
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:28,180
Once sentient ai goes live,
it could mean when guys like Elon Musk 

833
00:36:29,431 --> 00:36:32,100
are terrified,
you should be paying attention.

834
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:33,570
The people are poopooing that.
I'm like,

835
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:34,860
man,
I don't know.

836
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:36,480
That guy seems smart.
Yeah.

837
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:42,020
Yeah.
We have to be insanely thoughtful and I 

838
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,020
think,
and look,

839
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,750
I am a neophyte.
I'm not the guy that listened to and you

840
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:44,730
should be listening to people like Elon 
Musk on the topic,

841
00:36:44,731 --> 00:36:48,270
but my gut instinct is it's the 
underlying drives,

842
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:51,420
and you talked about that.
Once you give them the drive to create,

843
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:56,450
now it gets weird.
So what are the things that you imbue 

844
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:58,290
them with at the earliest level that has
to be decided way fucking early.

845
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:03,530
So imagine if you imbue the AI at 
facebook with a desire to connect to 

846
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:08,780
their human overlords and communicate 
effectively and make sure that they're 

847
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,500
kept in all that stuff like that's going
to give you a very different result than

848
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:14,610
failing to give them the desire to 
please or whatever.

849
00:37:14,611 --> 00:37:17,250
Like humans have a desire to connect 
with each other.

850
00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:18,900
They have empathy,
they have compassion.

851
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:23,901
And it is only in the rare case of a 
true sociopath that that kind of thing 

852
00:37:23,901 --> 00:37:23,901
is missing.
And we see,

853
00:37:23,901 --> 00:37:26,520
if you think of a sociopath is 
essentially ai gone wrong.

854
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:30,090
We see the kind of damage that they can 
wreck on the world.

855
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:34,470
So you have to be so thoughtful about 
what that underlying,

856
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:39,660
um,
desire system is the thing that propels 

857
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:39,660
them forward.

858
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,380
Yeah.
And giving them the ability to rewire 

859
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,320
whatever that desire system is,
if they decide that there has to be some

860
00:37:44,321 --> 00:37:49,321
sort of an,
there's some sort of reward for 

861
00:37:49,321 --> 00:37:52,741
competing.
So they decide they're going to compete 

862
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:52,741
and then they start looking at how they 
can,

863
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:57,480
how their thought process is,
is arranged how they're coding is 

864
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,201
arranged and they go,
well this is not the most efficient way 

865
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:01,220
for us to compete.
The most efficient way for us to compete

866
00:38:01,221 --> 00:38:04,060
is to be completely ruthless and not 
worried about biological life at all.

867
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:09,770
Let's get into that though.
So have you seen the studies that 

868
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:10,800
they've done on?
I'm trying to figure out like.

869
00:38:10,801 --> 00:38:15,801
So if you heard,
obviously you've heard nice guys finish 

870
00:38:15,801 --> 00:38:15,801
last,
right?

871
00:38:15,801 --> 00:38:16,440
So the guy named Eric Barker wrote this 
book called barking up the wrong tree.

872
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:18,330
He covered,
I forget who did the actual studies.

873
00:38:18,331 --> 00:38:23,331
Forgive me because I'm now attributing 
it to Eric Barker and he was just 

874
00:38:23,331 --> 00:38:26,120
talking about somebody else,
but they ran these studies where they 

875
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,130
wanted to find out,
um,

876
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,350
do nice guys finish last or not and what
they found,

877
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:33,351
looking at the data.
Nice guys finish last and they finished 

878
00:38:33,351 --> 00:38:35,871
first.
So if you're a nice guy and you let 

879
00:38:35,871 --> 00:38:35,871
people take advantage of you all the 
time,

880
00:38:35,871 --> 00:38:38,930
you're just going to get trod upon.
But if you're a nice guy and people 

881
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:38,930
know,
like,

882
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:41,641
Whoa,
you're a nice guy and you want to do 

883
00:38:41,641 --> 00:38:41,641
great things for you.

884
00:38:41,641 --> 00:38:41,641
Um,
and I call this the Keanu reeves effect.

885
00:38:41,641 --> 00:38:42,100
Like,
look how far that guy's gone.

886
00:38:42,101 --> 00:38:44,950
It's unbelievable.
His career is unimaginably great.

887
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,110
And when you hear people talk about,
I'm like,

888
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,590
just so quiet and private,
but behind the scenes everybody's like,

889
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,810
he's a good dude.
I've never met him.

890
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:57,811
I can't tell you,
but just like you hear that over and 

891
00:38:57,811 --> 00:38:57,811
over and over.
And he's a good dude.

892
00:38:57,811 --> 00:38:57,811
Good Dude.
Good Dude.

893
00:38:57,811 --> 00:38:59,740
And I think that that's created a lot of
the opportunities in his life.

894
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:04,770
So somebody,
a created this basically contests where 

895
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,340
they said submit your,
um,

896
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:11,580
your ai and they're going to compete in 
a contest to see who gets essentially 

897
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:15,661
it's called the prisoner's dilemma.
So in the prisoner's dilemma goes 

898
00:39:15,661 --> 00:39:18,711
something like this,
and hopefully I nailed this for shot 

899
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:18,711
here.
And the prisoner's dilemma is,

900
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:18,970
let's say you and I were both arrested.

901
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,650
Now we know that we actually committed 
the crime.

902
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:22,510
We did it together,
were arrested,

903
00:39:22,511 --> 00:39:25,210
were now put in separate cells to be 
interrogated.

904
00:39:25,211 --> 00:39:29,410
We can't communicate at all if we both 
stay silent.

905
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:34,470
We only get one year if I rat you out,
but you don't rat me out,

906
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:40,080
then I go off Scot free and you get five
years if you rat me out and I don't 

907
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,390
write you out,
vice versa.

908
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:45,391
And if we both rat each other out,
then we get like three years or 

909
00:39:45,391 --> 00:39:48,271
something.
So the best thing in no uncertain terms 

910
00:39:48,271 --> 00:39:48,271
is one year,
right?

911
00:39:48,271 --> 00:39:50,470
We both stay silent,
but you never know what the other person

912
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,550
is going to do.
So.

913
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,060
And you can get zero by routing the 
other person out.

914
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:59,061
So it's actually to your advantage in a 
one off to just say fuck him,

915
00:39:59,201 --> 00:40:01,270
he did it until he gets out of jail and 
kills you.

916
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,850
So there's that.
And so that gets into this thing.

917
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:04,420
And so they said,
well,

918
00:40:04,421 --> 00:40:09,421
we have to do is let them play it 
multiple times so that you have the 

919
00:40:09,421 --> 00:40:09,460
equivalent of he gets out of jail and 
then he kills you.

920
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:14,850
And what they found,
they had these really complicated 

921
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:14,850
algorithms ones where they're taking all
these factors into play.

922
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:19,771
Uh,
and ultimately they had people that 

923
00:40:19,771 --> 00:40:19,950
their algorithms that were like the pure
bad guy always taking advantage.

924
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,910
The pure nice guy,
never taking advantage.

925
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:25,210
And then the one that one was the 
simplest piece of code,

926
00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:28,840
I think it was two lines of code and it 
was code named tit for tat.

927
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:34,290
So it goes in,
it assumes you're going to be a good 

928
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:34,290
guy.
So it stays silent the first time.

929
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:38,010
But if you rat me out,
then the next time I write you out and 

930
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:42,001
what it does,
is it because you had all these 

931
00:40:42,001 --> 00:40:42,001
different algorithms that don't know 
each other,

932
00:40:42,001 --> 00:40:45,571
competing all trying their best strategy
and what it found was tit for tat was 

933
00:40:45,571 --> 00:40:48,811
ultimately the one that one,
because it would actually other ones 

934
00:40:48,811 --> 00:40:48,811
that we're learning from your behavior.

935
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:52,390
It was so easy to predict also people 
that lead with something good,

936
00:40:52,391 --> 00:40:54,010
they ended up in a virtuous cycle 
forever.

937
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,720
So tit for tat ends up being the best 
strategies.

938
00:40:56,721 --> 00:41:01,721
So from that perspective actually 
interesting because it's not always the 

939
00:41:01,721 --> 00:41:03,130
thing you think like mercilessness 
doesn't necessarily win.

940
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,020
And so finding like what is that 
equivalent in the machine world?

941
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:13,260
Right?
And it comes back to what you were 

942
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:13,260
talking about.
What's the reward?

943
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:13,260
Right?
So once you know what the reward is,

944
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:17,911
then you can have a better guess as to 
where they'll settle out and then their 

945
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:19,800
ability to code themselves.
I mean,

946
00:41:19,801 --> 00:41:24,801
I feel like if you have an artificial 
intelligence and you go give it the 

947
00:41:24,801 --> 00:41:27,631
ability to create a new artificial 
intelligence and eliminate whenever 

948
00:41:27,631 --> 00:41:30,760
possible restrictions or firewalls or 
whatever we've put on it.

949
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:36,450
Yeah.
So once they start writing their own 

950
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:36,450
code or fucked

951
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:36,450
that,
well not necessarily.

952
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:40,100
It comes down to the we could be right.
So it comes down to whether they want a,

953
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:45,130
they want a relationship with us or not.
And that's why I think the real races 

954
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:49,240
not to let ai get very far ahead.
So Ai will follow an exponential curve 

955
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:52,190
so it will eventually be so rapid.
Right?

956
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:54,280
So exponentials are simple doublings.
Um,

957
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:57,860
so most people think linear.
So if I say I'm going to take 30 steps,

958
00:41:57,861 --> 00:42:01,100
I'll end up about 30 yards away,
but if I take 30 exponential steps,

959
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:04,520
so I go first one yard than two yards,
four yards in eight,

960
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:09,521
then 16,
I'm 30 doublings is like a billion 

961
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:11,450
meters.
So you're like around the earth 26 times

962
00:42:11,451 --> 00:42:14,690
or something crazy.
So an exponential curve can get freaky.

963
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:19,840
But like before you get to those like 
really astronomical the elbow of the 

964
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,850
curve,
you could be making decisions along that

965
00:42:22,851 --> 00:42:24,290
path and this is definitely where I feel
like,

966
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:29,320
Oh God,
do I really know enough about this to 

967
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,181
say I'll high postulate from an 
ignorance standpoint and say in there 

968
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:35,621
somewhere,
as you can see like this is really 

969
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:35,621
taking off.

970
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:37,990
You can leverage what you're learning 
from the ai before it becomes a sort of 

971
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:40,220
all powerful being.
They can do whatever it wants and we can

972
00:42:40,221 --> 00:42:42,740
then begin the augmentation process in 
humans,

973
00:42:42,741 --> 00:42:44,570
which I think is inevitable.
Yeah,

974
00:42:44,571 --> 00:42:49,571
I think there's definitely inevitable.
It is fascinating when you think of the 

975
00:42:49,571 --> 00:42:52,811
possibilities that we really just 
speculating as to what's going to be 

976
00:42:52,811 --> 00:42:57,011
invented and how it's going to be 
implemented and what effect it's gonna 

977
00:42:57,011 --> 00:42:57,650
have on society.
It's a.

978
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:01,760
it's a really amazing time to be alive 
in that sense because I feel like we are

979
00:43:01,761 --> 00:43:05,630
literally on some sort of a launching 
pad watching it happen.

980
00:43:05,631 --> 00:43:07,280
Looking at a bunch of different 
directions,

981
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:10,160
trying to find out which one's going to 
go live first and then the facebook.

982
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,110
And I think happens in everybody's like,
oh Jesus,

983
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:13,560
look at that.
It's happening right there.

984
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:13,950
Like,
wow,

985
00:43:13,951 --> 00:43:14,690
can they shut it down?

986
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:15,560
They shut it down.
Okay,

987
00:43:15,561 --> 00:43:17,630
we're good for now.
You know that I'll,

988
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,210
I'll admit that one gave me pause.
Well,

989
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,240
technol optimist,
but that gave me pause.

990
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,410
We're incredibly imperfect.
The,

991
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:29,411
the human animal with its emotions and 
fears and all the weirdness of us are 

992
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,860
anxiety.
All are contemplating the possibilities,

993
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,250
the ego,
all the different variables that we take

994
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:39,860
into our lives and society and culture 
and civilizations.

995
00:43:39,861 --> 00:43:43,790
These are like really ineffective ways 
to exist and thrive.

996
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:49,060
But there their animal weighs integrated
into this new hard one.

997
00:43:49,641 --> 00:43:52,790
Zero culture like this,
this new binary thing,

998
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,480
this computer code,
uh,

999
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:57,680
operating systems,
internet information,

1000
00:43:57,681 --> 00:43:59,390
data engineering,
all these different,

1001
00:43:59,391 --> 00:44:02,880
like really hard things.
And then inside these heart,

1002
00:44:02,881 --> 00:44:04,930
I mean by hard meaning like,
you know,

1003
00:44:04,931 --> 00:44:05,970
like a,
like a,

1004
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,520
an intersecting line hits another wall 
and then there's a building and then 

1005
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:11,570
there's steel,
glass,

1006
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:16,250
all these things that humans have made,
but they're all like an absolute things.

1007
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:18,500
And then with us,
you have like,

1008
00:44:18,501 --> 00:44:19,430
wow,
I wonder,

1009
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,530
boy,
what's going to happen to people like me

1010
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:26,650
and you have all these weird real human 
feelings and variables and you know,

1011
00:44:30,621 --> 00:44:31,860
maybe weaknesses

1012
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,560
that are,
we're not going to be able to compete if

1013
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:37,770
we hold onto all those,
all the things that make us amazing,

1014
00:44:37,771 --> 00:44:42,771
that make crazy movies and great books,
that creativity that allows someone to 

1015
00:44:42,771 --> 00:44:47,091
make them incredible fantasy painting or
whatever the fuck it is that it comes 

1016
00:44:47,091 --> 00:44:51,651
out of us in our creations.
We're going to have to get rid of that 

1017
00:44:51,651 --> 00:44:52,890
if we're going to keep up with the AI.
The AI has no,

1018
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,630
no use for that shit.
Yes,

1019
00:44:54,631 --> 00:44:57,000
sort of.
So imagine.

1020
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:02,060
Here's something that I find interesting
and I admittedly don't know how this 

1021
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,620
plays out when something simply has the 
instructions to read your lines of code,

1022
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:09,621
right?
So your code will tell you what to do 

1023
00:45:09,621 --> 00:45:11,720
and sure,
there's elements where it plugs in a 

1024
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,521
variable and stuff and it would probably
be actually quite hard to build in 

1025
00:45:13,521 --> 00:45:13,560
things like creativity and stuff like 
that.

1026
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,650
But one thing that I find it fascinating
about humans,

1027
00:45:16,651 --> 00:45:19,680
and I hope that there's a corollary in 
ai,

1028
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:23,880
is if you damage a human's ability to 
feel emotion,

1029
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:28,530
they can't make decisions.
So I found that so fascinating.

1030
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,640
You literally,
they can,

1031
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:32,520
they are normal in every other respect,
you know,

1032
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:36,480
vs Ramachandran No.
So one of the most famous neuroscientist

1033
00:45:36,481 --> 00:45:40,680
working today to an amazing human being 
done awesome studies on stuff like this.

1034
00:45:40,681 --> 00:45:43,590
So what happens when people's brains get
damaged against them if you need,

1035
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:48,610
if you damaged them.
But what if they're born with this 

1036
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:51,081
issue?
Like what if they have like some sort 

1037
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:51,081
of.
In my work,

1038
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:51,081
either way,
I'm a sociopath,

1039
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,620
a will.
It doesn't make them.

1040
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,900
This one in particular doesn't make them
a sociopath.

1041
00:45:54,901 --> 00:45:56,640
But what it does is make it impossible 
for them to.

1042
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,810
So if I said,
hey,

1043
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,950
do you want to go get lunch?

1044
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:03,870
We can either get Chinese or Thai and 
you just,

1045
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,840
you,
you can rationalize why you would prefer

1046
00:46:06,841 --> 00:46:08,940
a tie,
but you ultimately can't make a decision

1047
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:11,790
because you need that emotion to tell 
you what to do.

1048
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,520
Now emotions,
the theory goes,

1049
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:18,900
are tied to your subconscious and the 
subconscious can process data faster and

1050
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:23,901
in vast quantities.
So what is doing is instead of then 

1051
00:46:23,901 --> 00:46:25,020
feeding you information in the form of 
words,

1052
00:46:25,021 --> 00:46:27,690
it just feeds you a feeling and then you
go based on that feeling,

1053
00:46:27,691 --> 00:46:32,691
but without that depth of information 
being processed and handed up in the 

1054
00:46:32,731 --> 00:46:35,190
form of an emotion,
a human can't make a decision,

1055
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:37,200
which I literally,
as I was reading about that,

1056
00:46:37,201 --> 00:46:37,590
I was like,
no,

1057
00:46:37,591 --> 00:46:37,950
no,
no man,

1058
00:46:37,951 --> 00:46:40,500
I'd be able to be able to like,
I'd be able to reason my way around it,

1059
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:41,790
but I know better than that.

1060
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,790
It's crazy.
The human mind is Nutso.

1061
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:48,660
So the reason I hope that there's some 
corollary is that you need to build into

1062
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:50,220
ai for it to function properly,
right?

1063
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:55,221
Because nobody knows how to build 
general ai yet and I like to think that 

1064
00:46:55,221 --> 00:46:56,660
part of that is going to be the safety 
valve of.

1065
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:01,670
They have to have emotions to give them 
that sort of non pure analytical.

1066
00:47:01,981 --> 00:47:03,690
It's got to be super flexible,
right?

1067
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:07,080
Because like strict analysis.
Let's go star trek for a second.

1068
00:47:07,081 --> 00:47:08,400
So spock,
right?

1069
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,380
Not always able to do what needs to be 
done.

1070
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:15,381
You need the human who can be nimble and
can read like all the ambiguities and 

1071
00:47:15,651 --> 00:47:18,300
morality and things like that,
and finally make a decision.

1072
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,790
So there are times where logic is going 
to let you down.

1073
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:23,910
So I'm hoping that because they will 
need,

1074
00:47:23,911 --> 00:47:28,911
I hope this grand thing that inhumans 
manifest as emotions moving,

1075
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:34,170
need something similar because in that 
you can program like we were talking 

1076
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:34,780
earlier about how do you make the 
desire,

1077
00:47:34,781 --> 00:47:36,490
right?
The desire to do something.

1078
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,740
If you can build in what I'll call 
goodness,

1079
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:43,741
just for lack of a better word,
if you can build an goodness into that 

1080
00:47:43,741 --> 00:47:44,660
desire to connect a desire to help,
um,

1081
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,790
you could in theory create benevolent 
Ai.

1082
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,750
Hm,
that's interesting.

1083
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,700
Um,
this is me riffing.

1084
00:47:53,701 --> 00:47:54,360
I am not.
No,

1085
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:54,750
no,
no.

1086
00:47:54,751 --> 00:47:56,700
But there's,
there's just makes sense.

1087
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,110
It also makes sense that emotions might 
be required to take action,

1088
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,520
that you have to have some sort of a 
reason to take action if you don't have 

1089
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:06,720
a biological imperative.
Right?

1090
00:48:06,721 --> 00:48:11,370
If you're not worried about breeding or 
your social status or what,

1091
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,440
what is causing you to move forward and 
if you made a perfect ai that was 

1092
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,271
emotion free,
would it just sit there idle and do 

1093
00:48:20,271 --> 00:48:23,001
nothing because there's no reward to it 
that's worth risking its existence or 

1094
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:27,411
doing anything to change the environment
around it other than perhaps the worry 

1095
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:32,571
about the power shutting off and even 
then if it's not worried about 

1096
00:48:32,571 --> 00:48:33,090
existence,
if it doesn't have any fear,

1097
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:36,930
if it doesn't have any emotion where 
it's considering the potential of death,

1098
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:38,910
like why?
Why would it act?

1099
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:41,370
Yeah,
and I think that would sit there.

1100
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:46,400
I think at some point in the code you 
have to write something that compels 

1101
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,191
them to do something.
So if you think of human beings as we 

1102
00:48:49,191 --> 00:48:52,071
exist now is like the first attempt at 
sentient ai and I think that's a pretty 

1103
00:48:52,171 --> 00:48:57,171
plausible way to look at us.
You realize we are by nature an active 

1104
00:48:57,171 --> 00:48:58,860
species,
so we go into any environment.

1105
00:48:58,861 --> 00:49:03,861
We try to figure it out first and then 
dominate it and no matter where you put 

1106
00:49:03,861 --> 00:49:04,380
us,
that's what we try to do.

1107
00:49:04,381 --> 00:49:09,381
You put us in the Arctic,
we're going to try to tame the cold you 

1108
00:49:09,381 --> 00:49:09,381
put us on the plains,
uh,

1109
00:49:09,381 --> 00:49:09,381
uh,
in,

1110
00:49:09,381 --> 00:49:11,370
in middle America,
and we're going to hunt the bison.

1111
00:49:11,371 --> 00:49:12,870
I mean,
it's just what we do,

1112
00:49:12,871 --> 00:49:14,880
right?
So you've got the drive of survival,

1113
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:19,140
but you also just have that,
that exploration gene.

1114
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:24,140
And maybe that's because that's how you 
avoided everybody dying of one play 

1115
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,730
because you just constantly wanting to 
spread out and dominate new dominion.

1116
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,800
Um,
but that's interesting.

1117
00:49:28,801 --> 00:49:32,280
And so at some level that's a decision 
when you think about Ai,

1118
00:49:32,281 --> 00:49:34,720
so somebody whatever blind,
um,

1119
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:35,700
evolution,
fine,

1120
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:38,700
but something has made that decision for
us.

1121
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,000
And in Ai,
it will have to be a very cognizant 

1122
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,750
decision.
And I think we'll have to get to true 

1123
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:50,871
general ai.
I think so many layers will have to be 

1124
00:49:50,871 --> 00:49:51,510
laid down of things like that,
oh,

1125
00:49:51,511 --> 00:49:53,840
this is an act of robot.
It never just sits idly.

1126
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:57,960
It always is looking for and what's I 
think connection to be of service,

1127
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:00,030
like decisions like that will have to be
made.

1128
00:50:00,031 --> 00:50:05,031
Now.
What do you do with the psycho who's 

1129
00:50:05,031 --> 00:50:06,741
like,
I'm going to create ai that takes that 

1130
00:50:06,741 --> 00:50:09,351
opensource because this will inevitably 
be open source and I switched the 

1131
00:50:09,351 --> 00:50:09,680
variable from being nice to crush the 
skull.

1132
00:50:09,681 --> 00:50:10,230
Love.
Right.

1133
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:15,440
So no question.
There are all kinds of problems but it 

1134
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,881
is.
It is so interesting to me to think 

1135
00:50:19,881 --> 00:50:19,881
about this stuff.

1136
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:25,330
Interesting to think of why people are 
so attracted to the romantic ideas of 

1137
00:50:26,121 --> 00:50:31,121
like living off land.
Like as technology is getting more and 

1138
00:50:31,121 --> 00:50:34,631
more complex,
you seeing more of these reality shows 

1139
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:37,390
where people are like,
I'm living the subsistence existence in 

1140
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:41,270
like Alaska and salmon fishing and 
trapping their own wood for fire.

1141
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:41,900
And we're like,
yeah,

1142
00:50:41,901 --> 00:50:46,901
look at them.
There's existing at a very closed loop 

1143
00:50:46,901 --> 00:50:47,120
system.
You know like when your.

1144
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:49,940
When you look at it like plains Indians 
or something like that.

1145
00:50:49,941 --> 00:50:52,670
We romanticize the day.
They used all of the bison.

1146
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,830
They use the hide for their clothes and 
they.

1147
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:57,860
They just did what they needed to stay 
alive and there was no innovation.

1148
00:50:57,861 --> 00:51:02,861
If you were born birth to death,
you wouldn't see any change in the 

1149
00:51:02,861 --> 00:51:07,420
civilization you would see essentially 
just like bows and arrows chasing bison,

1150
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:12,550
making campfire,
picking up the teepee when the herd 

1151
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:13,370
moves,
filing them Ad Nauseum,

1152
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,900
continue,
you know,

1153
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:15,610
it's there.

1154
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,070
That's very romantic tests right now.
Particularly Romantic.

1155
00:51:19,071 --> 00:51:24,071
I think it kind of always was in some 
way because I think we've always been 

1156
00:51:24,071 --> 00:51:25,040
aware that this thing,
once it gets going,

1157
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:27,200
once the momentum gets rolling and uh,
you know,

1158
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:28,940
as you were saying,
exponential change,

1159
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:29,860
it's just jump,
jump,

1160
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,340
jump,
jump,

1161
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:33,440
jump stacking on top of each other.
And then we all know,

1162
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:38,650
like it's gotten to weird,
unmanageable position during our 

1163
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:39,580
lifetimes as far as information is 
concerned.

1164
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:40,910
You know,
I was a kid,

1165
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:42,870
he had to read books,
you know,

1166
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,950
if you wanted to watch something on tv,
you had to be there when it came on,

1167
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:46,760
you know,
the.

1168
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,680
And then you saw it once and that was a 
wrap,

1169
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:53,730
you know,
and you get see reruns was the only way 

1170
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:53,730
you could see something.
Again,

1171
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:53,730
oh,
I remember the steps,

1172
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:54,470
so this is a rerun.

1173
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,880
You couldn't choose when to have it.
Now you can choose everything all the 

1174
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,910
time on your phone you're carrying 
around in your pocket.

1175
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:06,860
It works for hours and hours of video.
The input that you have into that.

1176
00:52:06,861 --> 00:52:09,080
It's like you could create your own 
content,

1177
00:52:09,081 --> 00:52:10,570
you can make your own videos.
There's,

1178
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:15,930
I mean how many fucking people are on 
youtube that have millions and millions 

1179
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:21,310
and millions of videos of hits rather 
have their videos and just all these 

1180
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:25,001
people tuning into their content all 
over the world and that just the idea 

1181
00:52:25,001 --> 00:52:29,561
that this is happening in our lifetime.
It didn't exist 20 years ago and it's 

1182
00:52:29,561 --> 00:52:32,000
now one of the most impactful things in 
the history of human nature.

1183
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:37,120
You got to go back to like the printing 
press for anything to have you remotely 

1184
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,110
as much of an impact on the culture as 
the Internet itself.

1185
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:41,600
That's crazy.
It's in our life is crazy.

1186
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,530
I know.
How old are you?

1187
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,800
Forty one.
So you were a member probably when the 

1188
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,410
Internet was clunky,
when it was just like,

1189
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,490
like,
you know,

1190
00:52:49,491 --> 00:52:54,491
you were probably really young and like 
17 or something like that when you first

1191
00:52:54,501 --> 00:52:58,250
heard about aol as when I was 18 was the
first time somebody said the word,

1192
00:52:58,251 --> 00:53:03,251
hey,
we should get email accounts when we go 

1193
00:53:03,251 --> 00:53:03,251
to college.
And I was like,

1194
00:53:03,251 --> 00:53:05,621
what the hell's an email?
That's the right year because you got 

1195
00:53:05,621 --> 00:53:08,270
all the way to like high school and into
college before it start affecting you.

1196
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:11,630
GotTa live like a regular person that 
was a junior in college?

1197
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,600
Yeah.
Didn't have AOL until I graduated.

1198
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:18,450
So I was in my early twenties before I'd
ever logged onto the Internet.

1199
00:53:18,451 --> 00:53:21,050
And you've got mail.
It's crazy.

1200
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:21,920
Yeah,
I didn't.

1201
00:53:21,921 --> 00:53:26,921
Uh,
I didn't get online until [inaudible] 

1202
00:53:26,921 --> 00:53:26,921
94.
I moved to La and now my friend Robbie,

1203
00:53:26,921 --> 00:53:28,380
who actually worked at a computer store 
before,

1204
00:53:28,381 --> 00:53:30,150
he was a comedian,
he,

1205
00:53:30,151 --> 00:53:31,680
uh,
he taught me about it.

1206
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:36,450
You're way ahead of me.
I didn't get on until 98,

1207
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,480
99.
You know what I did as soon as I found 

1208
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,391
out,
soon as I got online and started 

1209
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:44,391
downloaded ufo files,
I was like,

1210
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:45,900
well,
these ufo reports what's in there?

1211
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:48,000
I was completely convinced that it was 
like,

1212
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:50,130
I'm going to find the truth.
It's online.

1213
00:53:50,131 --> 00:53:51,420
You can download it and you can 
download.

1214
00:53:51,421 --> 00:53:53,010
It would take forever and we'd be like,
trump,

1215
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:53,880
trump,
trump,

1216
00:53:53,881 --> 00:53:54,720
trump.
Because a 14,

1217
00:53:54,721 --> 00:53:56,790
four modem chunk chunk and then it would
print it.

1218
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:58,380
Wasn't it mostly like text back then 
too?

1219
00:53:58,381 --> 00:53:58,880
Yeah,
yeah.

1220
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,920
There's like no pictures or if it was a 
picture it would take you hours to 

1221
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,300
download and they were.
They're coming so slow,

1222
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:07,080
clunk,
clunk,

1223
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:07,890
clunk,
clunk,

1224
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:08,580
clunk,
clunk.

1225
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,620
I remember my friend sent me a porno 
film,

1226
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:14,070
not even a porno film.
It was a clip last like 15 seconds.

1227
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:16,840
It took like an hour from the Senate to 
extras.

1228
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,260
Used to take 20,
30 minutes to load.

1229
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:20,160
It was crazy.
Yeah,

1230
00:54:20,161 --> 00:54:22,440
it was.
Websites were so strange.

1231
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:27,790
You know,
you would start loading them and they 

1232
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:29,571
would come down like water slowly coming
down the side of a building,

1233
00:54:30,331 --> 00:54:31,130
you know,
you'd see it.

1234
00:54:31,131 --> 00:54:36,131
Like it was weird.
Just remembered my dad catching like 

1235
00:54:36,131 --> 00:54:36,780
you've looked at the history and found 
some porn site.

1236
00:54:36,781 --> 00:54:37,540
I went on,
I was like,

1237
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:38,580
I don't know,
eighth grade,

1238
00:54:38,581 --> 00:54:41,400
and it was like Pamela Anderson's first 
playboy pictures and he's like,

1239
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,190
I want to see what you were looking at 
Walla while I'm not here.

1240
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:49,340
They went and took a shower and the 
whole time it was still loading and I 

1241
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:49,340
was just like,
oh no.

1242
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:50,750
What's he going to see?
What's it going to take a load line?

1243
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,420
Line it 30 minutes probably later.
Yeah.

1244
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:57,390
Now I mean you can get insane Internet 
on your phone.

1245
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,270
It's really pretty impressive.
I mean,

1246
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,860
and then the phones are getting weirder 
and weirder to like.

1247
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,770
Do you remember when phones first came 
out?

1248
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,800
The cool people at a little phone,
I can remember how to raise her and was 

1249
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:09,800
like,
bitch,

1250
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,500
lick a little mother fucker phone as 
little skinny ass thing.

1251
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,000
Pick it up.
Call people,

1252
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,770
close it.
It's like a credit card.

1253
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:19,110
Shows my pocket.
You were the coolest man.

1254
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,670
Yeah,
one of them little phones.

1255
00:55:20,671 --> 00:55:23,520
You were an idiot if you had one of 
those big phones right when you're doing

1256
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:28,521
that big stupid phone.
Now it's like things like this new 

1257
00:55:28,521 --> 00:55:30,210
Samsung,
there is no key,

1258
00:55:30,211 --> 00:55:32,000
uh,
old school society,

1259
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,350
but the really small ones with that 
right there.

1260
00:55:34,351 --> 00:55:36,690
The above one.
Look at that.

1261
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:41,860
The fuck is that thing.
They tried to make a new kind of like 

1262
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:41,860
dial all around it.

1263
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:46,020
You hold that thing up to your ear.
It's like a cell phone.

1264
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:49,380
I was like the size of a beeper.
Yeah.

1265
00:55:49,381 --> 00:55:52,170
Those were the shit.
Those little tiny ass phones.

1266
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:56,730
Now you get that new galaxy note eight.
Have you seen that monstrosity?

1267
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,760
Gigantic is huge.
So I guess whose pockets are going to 

1268
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,570
fit these things in?
That's a real problem.

1269
00:56:03,571 --> 00:56:07,200
When I first got my iphone six S,
was that that six plus?

1270
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,520
That's the first one.
That was big.

1271
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,950
I was like,
God damn,

1272
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,020
like it wouldn't even fit in my pocket.
So that was the first time.

1273
00:56:13,021 --> 00:56:14,880
And I'm still like,
I used the big phone,

1274
00:56:14,881 --> 00:56:19,881
but a lot of that nuance,
that's the s eight plus Jesus Christ 

1275
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:22,890
that's attach,
that's the s eight.

1276
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:27,130
The note eight is even bigger.
Look at that thing.

1277
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:32,370
Wow.
It's got a pet look at the size of that 

1278
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:32,370
thing like that.

1279
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:34,330
That could be a woman with small hands.
It's hard to tell.

1280
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:36,790
I would like to see it in the hands of a
basketball player,

1281
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:42,390
you know,
if like if you've got like Lebron James 

1282
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:42,390
like fondly or go to a foreigner can 
hold in my hand,

1283
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:46,920
you know,
because for him it's probably like King 

1284
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,541
Kong home little tiny people know was 
big giant hands.

1285
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,580
Like for a basketball player,
like a,

1286
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,730
some sort of a bill russell type 
character with giant hands.

1287
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:59,320
That's a good size phone.
But too small people.

1288
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:02,230
Not so much.
You're just trying too hard.

1289
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,260
I,
I never,

1290
00:57:03,261 --> 00:57:05,740
uh,
I had a galaxy note before.

1291
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,370
I never used that pen.
I use when I first got it,

1292
00:57:09,371 --> 00:57:10,960
I was like,
this pen is gonna rule.

1293
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,300
This is going to be the big difference.
I'm gonna send people pictures.

1294
00:57:13,301 --> 00:57:14,290
I'm gonna.
Draw dicks on them.

1295
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:15,550
I had this plan.

1296
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,950
It's a good plan.
That was the plan.

1297
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:23,380
It was just like to just make funny 
pictures over there and then never used 

1298
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:24,490
it.
I just got lazy.

1299
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,560
I think I just wasn't that into one 
thing.

1300
00:57:26,561 --> 00:57:31,561
It is interesting though is that you can
circle something and like say if like 

1301
00:57:31,561 --> 00:57:32,620
there's a part of an article that you 
think is interesting,

1302
00:57:32,621 --> 00:57:35,440
you could circle it and copy and paste 
it really simply and easily.

1303
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,100
Really?
Yeah.

1304
00:57:36,101 --> 00:57:38,320
It was pretty good with the actual image
itself.

1305
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:41,950
Like say if someone sends you something 
and there's some text and image,

1306
00:57:41,951 --> 00:57:45,340
you could just circle around it and send
that to yourself and say,

1307
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:47,290
yeah.
What do you use?

1308
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:48,080
Iphone?
Yeah.

1309
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:51,250
Do you ever fuck around with windows?
Um,

1310
00:57:51,251 --> 00:57:53,710
I did for awhile while my first computer
was windows.

1311
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:54,790
Um,
for work.

1312
00:57:54,791 --> 00:57:56,470
At one point I was having to use 
windows.

1313
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:57,850
But um,
yeah,

1314
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:01,210
as somebody who really appreciates good 
design that didn't last long.

1315
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:02,810
Windows 10 is pretty good.
Yeah.

1316
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:05,830
It's not quite good enough.
It's pretty God damn good.

1317
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:11,370
But that's what's always been 
fascinating to me is that Microsoft is 

1318
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:11,500
the biggest company when it comes to 
operating systems,

1319
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:14,660
but it's not the best,
you know,

1320
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:16,190
and everybody kind of knows that,
but it's,

1321
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,820
there's this weird sort of battle.
I mean,

1322
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,130
apple's big enough,
they have plenty,

1323
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:26,131
they make the best stuff that make the 
most high end stuff and a lot of 

1324
00:58:26,131 --> 00:58:26,131
people's eyes,
it's real limited.

1325
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:29,590
Like you can only get what they put out.
If you want a windows laptop,

1326
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:33,370
you have a hundred options and the more,
you know,

1327
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,440
if you want a Mac laptop,
you have a few.

1328
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:38,170
But the interesting thing is that was 
steve jobs approach,

1329
00:58:38,171 --> 00:58:39,580
right?
Was He came in and said,

1330
00:58:39,581 --> 00:58:40,660
you have too many options.

1331
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:45,660
This is stupid.
You've really got to narrow this stuff 

1332
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,581
down.
Microsoft surface laptops pulled their 

1333
00:58:47,581 --> 00:58:49,791
recommendation after announcing it,
I guess two years ago they recommended 

1334
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:51,160
it and now it's like the first time 
they've pulled it in a long time.

1335
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:51,940
Oh,
interesting.

1336
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:57,030
Predicted reliability with an estimated 
two year breakage rates of 25 percent.

1337
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:58,180
Ooh,
that's not good.

1338
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:01,720
They got cheap specific.
The new one that Microsoft surface.

1339
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,530
Well that's interesting because there 
was another study that I saw written out

1340
00:59:04,531 --> 00:59:05,250
the study,
um,

1341
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:05,770
uh,
you know,

1342
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,850
one of those lists that listed is the 
best laptop available in 2017.

1343
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:15,140
I just like within the last week.
Maybe it's just like different consumer 

1344
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:20,311
groups,
but maybe the best laptop while it 

1345
00:59:20,311 --> 00:59:20,311
works.
Yeah.

1346
00:59:20,311 --> 00:59:21,830
If what you have is a breakage prior.
Yeah.

1347
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:25,280
But the problem is that working while 
it's working,

1348
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,840
it's the best.
How long it's going to work.

1349
00:59:26,841 --> 00:59:28,520
It's not gonna work that well,
but you know,

1350
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:29,930
it's like a sprinter,
you know,

1351
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:32,030
they're the fastest,
but they don't run the longest.

1352
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:35,600
Very true right now.
I think that's fair.

1353
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:37,700
So what are you trying to do with this 
company?

1354
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:40,100
Like literally pull people out of the 
Matrix.

1355
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:42,740
So yes,
wait a minute.

1356
00:59:42,741 --> 00:59:44,420
That is our stated mission,
my friend.

1357
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:49,450
We are here to pull people out of the 
matrix so I can walk you through it if 

1358
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:50,270
you really want to know it goes like 
this.

1359
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:51,460
So,
um,

1360
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,160
when I,
I'm not a born entrepreneur,

1361
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:58,660
so I'm very,
very far from it and three are,

1362
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:01,190
they're born entrepreneurs are,
there are people that will tell you that

1363
01:00:01,191 --> 01:00:04,280
there are only born entrepreneurs.
Those people are idiots.

1364
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:05,910
Yeah,
I would agree with that.

1365
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,700
There's some amazing people that say 
that,

1366
01:00:07,701 --> 01:00:11,660
but I just think that they're very,
very catastrophic wrong about this.

1367
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,760
People say Shit like that.
To me.

1368
01:00:13,761 --> 01:00:16,640
It's like saying you're a born mixed 
martial artists now.

1369
01:00:16,641 --> 01:00:19,640
There might be people that have certain 
athletic gifts that make it,

1370
01:00:19,641 --> 01:00:24,641
they get early wins and there's just 
things that clicked into place for them 

1371
01:00:24,641 --> 01:00:24,641
in a way that it doesn't for other 
people.

1372
01:00:24,641 --> 01:00:29,261
But if you get a grinder or somebody 
that's really willing to put in the 

1373
01:00:29,261 --> 01:00:31,991
work,
then you can get somebody who becomes 

1374
01:00:31,991 --> 01:00:33,200
absolutely extraordinary.
So that certainly has been my life.

1375
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,510
So I grew up being taught to be a good 
employee,

1376
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:40,511
keep my head down,
do as little work as possible and avoid 

1377
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:40,511
punishment at all costs.
That was my life.

1378
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:44,290
So my parents taught me to be a good 
employee and I obviously that didn't sit

1379
01:00:44,691 --> 01:00:45,230
well with me.

1380
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:47,930
I wanted to do something more.
I had pretty big ambition.

1381
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:52,990
Uh,
I go to film school and I do very well 

1382
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:53,390
in film school until my final film and 
then I fall flat on my face,

1383
01:00:53,391 --> 01:00:55,760
embarrass myself and realize I'm not a 
talented filmmaker.

1384
01:00:56,150 --> 01:01:01,150
And in that,
what made you notice that you weren't 

1385
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:01,150
in?
Why'd you think you couldn't get better?

1386
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,540
So,
great question.

1387
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:06,830
So when I started film school,
I believed that you either were talented

1388
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:11,831
or you weren't right.
There's just some things you either can 

1389
01:01:11,831 --> 01:01:11,831
sing or you can't do,
other can draw,

1390
01:01:11,831 --> 01:01:11,831
you can't,
uh,

1391
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,910
when it comes to art,
which I saw film as art,

1392
01:01:13,911 --> 01:01:18,911
you were either good or you're not.
And so that was how I thought of it and 

1393
01:01:18,911 --> 01:01:18,911
I thought you could get better at the 
technical side.

1394
01:01:18,911 --> 01:01:20,930
So I was going to film school to learn 
the technical aspects,

1395
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:24,320
but I was banking on the fact that I was
inherently talented.

1396
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:29,350
So I go and my first year and a half 
went very well and I was crushing it 

1397
01:01:30,441 --> 01:01:32,840
certainly by my own estimation,
doing very well,

1398
01:01:32,841 --> 01:01:37,841
getting the attention of my classmates.
And then only four people out of the 

1399
01:01:37,841 --> 01:01:41,300
entire school for your year get to make 
a senior thesis film.

1400
01:01:41,301 --> 01:01:43,610
And I was chosen as one of the four.
So it was like,

1401
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:44,500
yeah man,
I just,

1402
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:49,510
I have it.
And there were two filmmakers that were 

1403
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:49,880
really big for me.
One was John Wu.

1404
01:01:49,881 --> 01:01:52,170
Do you remember John Lewis?
Yeah,

1405
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:56,810
like the eighties and nineties.
Just shoot 'em ups a lot.

1406
01:01:56,930 --> 01:02:00,500
And I loved him and he was famous for.
He would roll up on set.

1407
01:02:00,501 --> 01:02:01,820
He wouldn't think about it ahead of 
time.

1408
01:02:01,821 --> 01:02:05,720
He just put the camera wherever felt 
right and his movies were mind blowing.

1409
01:02:05,721 --> 01:02:07,250
People always refer to it.
It is.

1410
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,080
His violence is like a ballet.

1411
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,880
It's now well orchestrated.
That beautiful,

1412
01:02:10,881 --> 01:02:12,350
that interesting.
And so I thought,

1413
01:02:12,351 --> 01:02:17,351
okay,
well if I'm naturally talented than I 

1414
01:02:17,351 --> 01:02:17,351
should be like that.
And then there was,

1415
01:02:17,351 --> 01:02:17,840
hitchcock was sort of the plotter.
Um,

1416
01:02:17,841 --> 01:02:20,040
he would spend all of his time like pre 
planning,

1417
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:25,041
the film.
Every shot was so orchestrated ahead of 

1418
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:25,041
time.
He said,

1419
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:25,041
I get bored on set.
And I thought,

1420
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:29,961
God man,
like he doesn't sound like natural 

1421
01:02:29,961 --> 01:02:29,961
talent to me.
So I'm over here,

1422
01:02:29,961 --> 01:02:34,321
I want to be John Woo.
I show up onset acting like I'm John 

1423
01:02:34,321 --> 01:02:37,760
Woo,
I don't preplan anything and put the 

1424
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,081
camera where it feels right and just 
publicly embarrassed myself as I turn 

1425
01:02:39,081 --> 01:02:43,461
this film into a piece of shit.
And at that point I thought I was about 

1426
01:02:43,461 --> 01:02:44,850
to graduate.
Get the three picture deal.

1427
01:02:44,851 --> 01:02:46,950
Everything is going to be sad,
it's going to be amazing.

1428
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:49,110
And there I am,
crash and burn.

1429
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:54,110
Now the other students are circling me 
like vultures because I mean that's the 

1430
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:56,070
film industry man like it.
It is a zero sum game or at least it was

1431
01:02:56,071 --> 01:03:01,071
back then.
That's how people saw because it wasn't 

1432
01:03:01,071 --> 01:03:01,071
like today where you could edit on your 
fucking.

1433
01:03:01,071 --> 01:03:02,850
I'm usually editing like right now,
like that didn't exist.

1434
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,780
So it was you had to get access to real 
resources.

1435
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:09,270
So when I realized,
Oh my God,

1436
01:03:09,271 --> 01:03:13,560
I don't have a thesis project to show 
people to get an agent or whatever,

1437
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,600
it's done.
I'm not a talented filmmaker.

1438
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:20,990
And so I was so desperate in that I 
needed something that would free me from

1439
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:26,880
feeling like a permanent failure.
And that thing that I had was the notion

1440
01:03:26,881 --> 01:03:29,130
of Alfred Hitchcock,
and even though it wasn't sexy,

1441
01:03:29,131 --> 01:03:32,340
it gave me a window into maybe there's 
another way,

1442
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:37,370
maybe there is another way that somebody
can be an artist and and they just have 

1443
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:37,370
to learn it.

1444
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:38,280
Like think about if somebody draws,
right?

1445
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:40,170
Some people can rotate an object in 
their mind.

1446
01:03:40,171 --> 01:03:41,610
If you've seen on Iq tests,
they make it.

1447
01:03:41,611 --> 01:03:42,600
Yeah,
I can't do that.

1448
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:44,460
I literally can't rotate an object in my
mind.

1449
01:03:44,461 --> 01:03:46,590
I don't even understand people that can 
do it.

1450
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:52,130
So I thought,
well maybe you could become a great 

1451
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:52,260
artist just by memorizing every 
conceivable pose,

1452
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:57,261
like a chess player.
The great chess grand masters are the 

1453
01:03:57,261 --> 01:03:58,290
ones that have memorized so many 
different moves and combinations that it

1454
01:03:58,291 --> 01:03:59,970
becomes somewhat intuitive for them.
So I thought,

1455
01:03:59,971 --> 01:04:04,971
okay,
that's going to have to be my path that 

1456
01:04:04,971 --> 01:04:04,971
gave me an escape route.
And then going down that path of saying,

1457
01:04:04,971 --> 01:04:07,200
I just have to learn this stuff.
I'm not naturally talented,

1458
01:04:07,201 --> 01:04:08,760
but I have to learn.
Unfortunately,

1459
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:11,310
Carol Dweck had not written her book 
mindset at that point,

1460
01:04:11,311 --> 01:04:13,920
so I didn't have the words,
growth mindset,

1461
01:04:13,921 --> 01:04:16,320
fixed mindset,
but I began to transition out.

1462
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:21,320
So a fixed mindset is what I had,
which you believe your talent and 

1463
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:21,480
intelligence are fixed traits.
They can't be changed.

1464
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:26,750
Somebody with a growth mindset,
realizing that your talent and 

1465
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:29,151
intelligence are malleable,
that you can develop them through 

1466
01:04:29,151 --> 01:04:32,001
discipline practice.
So I began to adopt sort of the 

1467
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:33,600
beginnings of that mindset,
realizing that I'm just a grinder,

1468
01:04:33,601 --> 01:04:37,590
I have to work and I have to get better.
So I start teaching film school,

1469
01:04:37,591 --> 01:04:42,591
and in teaching film school,
the best way to learn something is to 

1470
01:04:42,591 --> 01:04:42,750
teach it.
So now I'm getting better as a filmmaker

1471
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:45,840
just by teaching it to these guys,
helping them develop their scripts,

1472
01:04:45,841 --> 01:04:47,940
helping them shoot their films.
And then,

1473
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,170
um,
at that time,

1474
01:04:49,171 --> 01:04:54,171
these two very successful entrepreneurs 
came into my class and there were two 

1475
01:04:54,171 --> 01:04:57,411
things as a kid,
I promised myself growing up in a 

1476
01:04:57,411 --> 01:04:59,751
morbidly obese family that one day I 
would be rich and one day I'd have six 

1477
01:04:59,751 --> 01:04:59,751
pack abs.

1478
01:04:59,751 --> 01:05:01,470
And so here were these,
they were yolked,

1479
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:06,770
these two yoked bodybuilder guys that 
were successful entrepreneurs and they 

1480
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:10,791
said,
why don't you come work for us and be a 

1481
01:05:10,791 --> 01:05:11,100
copywriter and it's a startup company.
You can have any role in the company you

1482
01:05:11,101 --> 01:05:16,101
want,
but you just have to become the right 

1483
01:05:16,101 --> 01:05:16,500
person for that job and then you can get
rich and you can go back and control the

1484
01:05:16,501 --> 01:05:18,100
art.
You can movies your way.

1485
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:19,540
So it's like,
oh my God,

1486
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:21,730
like this is too good to be true.
I have to go do this.

1487
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:27,030
So I joined them as a copywriter as they
were starting this fledgling technology 

1488
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:31,501
company and I'm just to keep this from 
getting impossibly long for about eight 

1489
01:05:31,501 --> 01:05:32,440
and a half years.
I just chase money.

1490
01:05:32,441 --> 01:05:35,500
I'm just trying to get rich to go back 
and make movies my way.

1491
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:37,690
But in that they were very growth 
minded.

1492
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:42,690
I began to really develop a growth 
mindset to believe that I could do 

1493
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:43,240
anything I set my mind to without 
limitation.

1494
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:48,480
I just had to understand that there was 
a gap in skillset between where I was 

1495
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,421
and where I wanted to get and I had to 
be willing to put in the work to get 

1496
01:05:51,421 --> 01:05:51,421
that skill.
Right.

1497
01:05:51,421 --> 01:05:51,430
So,
um,

1498
01:05:51,431 --> 01:05:53,700
I trained exactly one time with a man.
I,

1499
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:55,630
you must know him for us.
The hobby.

1500
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:56,850
Sure.
Alright.

1501
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:58,420
So for us,
by the way,

1502
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:03,421
I feel a moral obligation to help him 
become famous because he is one of the 

1503
01:06:03,421 --> 01:06:05,800
most intriguing minds I've ever come 
across in my life.

1504
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:07,570
Yeah.
We were supposed to do a podcast last.

1505
01:06:07,571 --> 01:06:10,180
There's a UFC in Anaheim,
but his fighter got canceled,

1506
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:13,030
the flight got canceled and so he won.
I'm not coming on.

1507
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,310
I'm a big fan of though that as a 
person,

1508
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:20,370
heartbreaking as a fighter,
a trainer as well as mixed martial 

1509
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:20,440
artist,
very talented guy.

1510
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:25,710
Very.
And in getting to roll with him in my 

1511
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:29,140
single moment as a grappler.
Uh,

1512
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:31,030
it was.
Did you ever grab it before?

1513
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:31,750
No,
never.

1514
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:33,640
So you just rolled with him the first 
time,

1515
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:34,960
but he's a black belt.
Yeah.

1516
01:06:34,961 --> 01:06:39,961
But,
and that's why it was the best thing 

1517
01:06:39,961 --> 01:06:41,251
ever.
So he knew how to not let me get 

1518
01:06:41,251 --> 01:06:42,901
injured.
He knew how to move and just the right 

1519
01:06:42,901 --> 01:06:42,901
way,
how to show me things.

1520
01:06:42,901 --> 01:06:44,800
He's so kind and compassionate and 
patient.

1521
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:50,070
I can't imagine a better intro to 
grappling was unbelievable and what it 

1522
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:52,990
showed me that even just in like the 
hour that he and I grappled,

1523
01:06:52,991 --> 01:06:54,220
I went from,
dude,

1524
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:57,430
I am so lost.
Even spatially I can't tell where I am.

1525
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:01,300
Like once you start moving me,
I just get lost and then an hour later I

1526
01:07:01,301 --> 01:07:03,520
could.
He gave me like these two basic moves to

1527
01:07:03,521 --> 01:07:08,521
learn how to execute and by the end I 
could do it and it was like the exact 

1528
01:07:08,521 --> 01:07:12,811
reminder of what a growth mindset is and
how even something that foreign to me 

1529
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:16,360
with a good teacher practice you can get
good.

1530
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:21,510
I mean look,
it's going to take years and years and 

1531
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:22,240
years to become even competent in 
Jujitsu,

1532
01:07:22,241 --> 01:07:24,460
let alone be able to participate at a 
high level.

1533
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:29,080
But it was a great micro reminder of 
just how powerfully humans can learn.

1534
01:07:29,081 --> 01:07:32,080
Now here's my theory about humans and 
learning and why,

1535
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:34,540
and just I guess to wrap up my 
entrepreneurial journey,

1536
01:07:34,541 --> 01:07:37,640
so I decide I don't want to chase money 
anymore.

1537
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:39,390
Not going to do that.
So I go into my partners.

1538
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:39,790
I say,
look,

1539
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:41,060
I quit.
This is about eight and a half.

1540
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:43,060
Actually,
I quit it about the six year mark.

1541
01:07:43,061 --> 01:07:45,100
Ended up actually getting out at about 
eight and half years,

1542
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:46,540
so six years I say,
I quit,

1543
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:48,340
I can't do this anymore.
I'm living the cliche of money.

1544
01:07:48,341 --> 01:07:50,290
Can't buy happiness.
This is absolutely ridiculous.

1545
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:52,450
I'm so here's your equity back,
final,

1546
01:07:52,451 --> 01:07:54,190
cross the finish line,
ash and get anything for this.

1547
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:56,830
So you didn't,
you weren't obligated to give that money

1548
01:07:56,831 --> 01:07:58,150
back.
You decided to correct.

1549
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:00,820
So it's like a movie,
but that to me,

1550
01:08:00,821 --> 01:08:05,821
is is the right thing to do?
Yell or do I get shot at the end of 

1551
01:08:05,821 --> 01:08:05,821
this?
I don't know.

1552
01:08:05,821 --> 01:08:08,050
It sounds like so romanticized it.
Yeah.

1553
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:10,420
So I think everybody should live by a 
code,

1554
01:08:10,421 --> 01:08:12,790
right?
It's what's right for you.

1555
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:16,310
And so I have a code,
very strong code that I live by.

1556
01:08:16,311 --> 01:08:18,290
That was one of the things like I'm the 
one quitting,

1557
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:20,870
like these guys have done nothing but 
create opportunity for me,

1558
01:08:20,871 --> 01:08:25,871
so I'm quitting.
I'm not going to cross the finish line 

1559
01:08:25,871 --> 01:08:25,871
because I feel literally dead inside.
I can't keep doing.

1560
01:08:25,871 --> 01:08:30,641
This doesn't make sense.
I realized the game you're playing is 

1561
01:08:30,641 --> 01:08:30,641
not money.
I promise it's not success.

1562
01:08:30,641 --> 01:08:33,920
It's brain chemistry.
So once you understand the game,

1563
01:08:33,921 --> 01:08:38,840
your playing is brain chemistry and that
if you have seven point $4,000,000,000

1564
01:08:38,841 --> 01:08:40,310
and hate your life,
I want to commit suicide.

1565
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:45,310
What the fuck good is the money.
And conversely if you have no money but 

1566
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:49,631
you feel a deep sense of fulfillment,
self pride and believe in what you're 

1567
01:08:49,631 --> 01:08:53,921
doing.
Like what do you care that you don't 

1568
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:53,921
have money,
better brand chemistry,

1569
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:54,050
better brain chemistry.
So,

1570
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,180
so what'd you do?
So they said,

1571
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:57,590
look,
we could do this without you.

1572
01:08:57,591 --> 01:09:02,591
They were totally caught off guard.
They said we could do this without you 

1573
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:05,171
but we don't want to.
So let's talk about what would it look 

1574
01:09:05,171 --> 01:09:08,891
like for us to work together.
And so by this point we've got a deep 

1575
01:09:08,891 --> 01:09:08,891
friendship.
You know,

1576
01:09:08,891 --> 01:09:09,860
I'm not like the new kid on the block 
anymore.

1577
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:10,850
Um,
and I said,

1578
01:09:10,851 --> 01:09:12,320
okay,
if we're gonna work together,

1579
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:14,660
it's got to be something entirely 
predicated on value,

1580
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:16,790
not money.
I need to be honest.

1581
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:20,060
My highest priority in business is not 
profitability,

1582
01:09:20,061 --> 01:09:20,930
it's comradery.

1583
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:23,630
So that's why when they said we could do
this without you,

1584
01:09:23,631 --> 01:09:25,010
but we don't want to,
that was the thing.

1585
01:09:25,011 --> 01:09:30,011
Let me reconnect to the Brotherhood that
had made it interesting for me in the 

1586
01:09:30,011 --> 01:09:31,460
early days.
And so that felt amazing.

1587
01:09:31,461 --> 01:09:35,780
And so I was like,
I'll come back if it's all about value,

1588
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:38,990
if we're doing something we're 
passionate about and if we're asking and

1589
01:09:38,991 --> 01:09:42,800
answering the question,
what would we do everyday and love,

1590
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:47,830
even if we were failing,
because the struggle is guaranteed to 

1591
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:47,870
get a bunch of people in a business to 
agree to that though,

1592
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,040
isn't it?
Uh,

1593
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:51,740
what wasn't for me because they were 
already there.

1594
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:53,450
So they were like,
it's crazy.

1595
01:09:53,451 --> 01:09:56,150
We felt the same way for a very long 
time because we,

1596
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,260
we,
we,

1597
01:09:57,261 --> 01:10:02,261
and by we,
they were so much farther ahead than me 

1598
01:10:02,261 --> 01:10:05,051
at this point.
So they really gave me the opportunity 

1599
01:10:05,051 --> 01:10:07,541
to learn,
had really built that tech company up 

1600
01:10:07,541 --> 01:10:09,971
like we got,
I think evaluation of 22 million if I'm 

1601
01:10:09,971 --> 01:10:10,130
not mistaken at one point and we just 
couldn't get it passed.

1602
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:14,240
And so it was like we'd been struggling 
for years to move the needle more and we

1603
01:10:14,241 --> 01:10:16,220
just couldn't.
So it wasn't like,

1604
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:21,250
oh,
I come in and give some amazing Jerry 

1605
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:21,250
Maguire speech and they're all like,
all right,

1606
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:21,250
fuck it.
US too.

1607
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,390
It was like finally somebody just said 
what everybody was already thinking.

1608
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,350
So they said,
all right,

1609
01:10:24,351 --> 01:10:29,351
let's give us a timeline of six months.
If we hit these revenue numbers in six 

1610
01:10:29,351 --> 01:10:30,380
months,
we'll keep going,

1611
01:10:30,381 --> 01:10:31,550
but if we miss them,
we'll sell.

1612
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:36,760
So we didn't hit them.
And so we began the sales process and 

1613
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:39,341
all in it was about eight and a half 
years by the time that was finally sold 

1614
01:10:39,341 --> 01:10:42,220
and the thing for three very different 
reasons that we decided to found that 

1615
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:46,271
was going to be predicated around 
delivering value to our employees and 

1616
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:49,451
our customers.
That was going to be that thing that we 

1617
01:10:49,451 --> 01:10:49,451
would love doing everyday,
even if we were failing.

1618
01:10:49,451 --> 01:10:51,900
That allowed me to connect emotionally 
because um,

1619
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:55,130
it ended up being quest nutrition.
I grew up in a morbidly obese family and

1620
01:10:55,131 --> 01:10:57,490
I wanted to save my mom and my sister 
and it would,

1621
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:00,230
it gave me this Mother Teresa has a 
great quote.

1622
01:11:00,231 --> 01:11:03,800
She says nobody will act for the many,
but people will act for the one.

1623
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:09,220
So finally I could just think about two 
people that I knew and loved and I 

1624
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:09,560
wanted to do something awesome for them.
So when I got tired,

1625
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:14,561
when I was fatigued,
rather than thinking about money in a 

1626
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:14,820
big house and a fast,
I was asking about fucking saving my mom

1627
01:11:14,821 --> 01:11:19,821
and my sister.
And our idea was if we could make food 

1628
01:11:19,821 --> 01:11:21,360
that people could choose based on taste 
and it happened to be good for them,

1629
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:24,990
we could actually end metabolic disease.
So that was the driving force.

1630
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:27,570
And we're fucking excited about it.
And we didn't know if it would be a real

1631
01:11:27,571 --> 01:11:28,560
business.
We didn't know.

1632
01:11:28,561 --> 01:11:30,420
Like every time we'd explain it to 
people,

1633
01:11:30,421 --> 01:11:32,220
we're putting value first and we 
thought,

1634
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:37,221
God did we sound like total assholes,
but it was like we really believed in 

1635
01:11:37,221 --> 01:11:40,971
it,
and so it gave us insights into social 

1636
01:11:40,971 --> 01:11:43,551
media,
the SPEC in 2009 when nobody was really 

1637
01:11:43,551 --> 01:11:43,620
using it for business and we could see 
that it's just a megaphone,

1638
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,800
so if you actually do deliver that kind 
of value for people,

1639
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:50,370
they're going to talk and now they have 
the ability to talk to a global audience

1640
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,800
within minutes of an interaction with 
your company.

1641
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:54,570
So if you were really taking care of 
them,

1642
01:11:54,571 --> 01:11:58,170
you really delivered a product that was 
real and you were building community,

1643
01:11:58,171 --> 01:11:59,160
community,
community,

1644
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:02,610
then you could really do something and 
so that's how it took off.

1645
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:07,610
But it really did.
I used to joke and say quest as a 

1646
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:07,610
company born out of misery because it 
was,

1647
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:12,111
it was three guys slogging it out.
Not really even liking the product that 

1648
01:12:12,111 --> 01:12:16,221
we made.
It just served a need in the 

1649
01:12:16,221 --> 01:12:16,221
marketplace.
I'm a security software.

1650
01:12:16,221 --> 01:12:17,280
We didn't care about it.
We didn't use it in our own company.

1651
01:12:17,281 --> 01:12:18,660
So it was like,
Oh God,

1652
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,840
so getting into something we were 
obsessed with talking about nutrition.

1653
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,540
Anyway,
I've lost 60 pounds and kept it off.

1654
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:26,550
Uh,
I went through a pencil head phase.

1655
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:31,551
I've added muscle,
like learning about diet to escape the 

1656
01:12:31,551 --> 01:12:32,340
fate of my family has been so important 
to me,

1657
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:33,930
but that was all back at a technology 
company.

1658
01:12:33,931 --> 01:12:37,260
So we were now leveraged and one of my 
partners a fucking nutritional genius.

1659
01:12:37,261 --> 01:12:42,261
This dude is unreal.
So leveraging what we were doing and 

1660
01:12:42,261 --> 01:12:46,161
thinking about already just was insanely
powerful for us as a business 

1661
01:12:46,531 --> 01:12:47,220
opportunity.

1662
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:52,350
And we ended up making more in a single 
day at quest and we made annually at the

1663
01:12:52,351 --> 01:12:57,351
tech company.
So you went from telling me about being 

1664
01:12:57,351 --> 01:13:01,701
a failed movie maker in college to the 
full journey of quest nutrition.

1665
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:04,680
Yeah.
I don't know if that's good or bad,

1666
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:05,910
but there it is.
Yeah.

1667
01:13:05,911 --> 01:13:07,890
It's um,
it's crazy journeyman.

1668
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:13,430
That's weird that you um,
didn't want to go back to filmmaking 

1669
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:13,430
though,
could you,

1670
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:14,460
you've realized you fucked up and why 
you fucked up.

1671
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,440
Well,
so here we all come full circle.

1672
01:13:16,441 --> 01:13:18,700
So this is what your new country company
is,

1673
01:13:18,701 --> 01:13:23,701
so new companies about making you want 
to make films when you want a 

1674
01:13:23,701 --> 01:13:23,910
traditional narrative content.
Yeah.

1675
01:13:23,911 --> 01:13:25,050
So comic books,
books,

1676
01:13:25,051 --> 01:13:27,020
movies,
TV shows have used fucked up.

1677
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:32,060
Don't you think that it's one of those 
things that like when you were in film 

1678
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:35,481
school and when you're trying to come up
with a thesis film that this was like a 

1679
01:13:35,481 --> 01:13:40,401
step in a very long journey of figuring 
out how to make films and that when you 

1680
01:13:40,401 --> 01:13:41,540
left it,
you gotTa Kinda,

1681
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:46,690
you're going right back to where you 
were or has life experience giving you 

1682
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:50,601
more tools to work with and you could 
sort of apply those to the idea of 

1683
01:13:50,601 --> 01:13:50,601
creative filmmaking.

1684
01:13:50,601 --> 01:13:51,300
Yeah,
exactly that.

1685
01:13:51,301 --> 01:13:54,840
So what I'm not trying to do is go back 
and be a director.

1686
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,520
What I want to do now is build the 
studio.

1687
01:13:56,521 --> 01:14:01,521
So I'm becoming an entrepreneur and 
training myself in that way has created 

1688
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:06,141
an obsession with scale for me.
So the thought of myopically making one 

1689
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:10,461
movie is absolutely terrifying.
Like just the amount of time it would 

1690
01:14:10,461 --> 01:14:13,240
take and your ability to push multiple 
things forward.

1691
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:18,540
Essentially grindstone,
you want sort of finance other people's 

1692
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:18,540
ideas and projects that will be part of 
it,

1693
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:19,570
be a part of it,
that'll be part of it.

1694
01:14:19,571 --> 01:14:23,530
Bringing a team together that can 
execute at scale and create,

1695
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:24,660
um,
a,

1696
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:29,750
a lot of content and in the beginning 
we're going to have to partner with 

1697
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:32,461
people.
We just don't have enough finances like 

1698
01:14:32,461 --> 01:14:32,461
we have enough to,
you know,

1699
01:14:32,461 --> 01:14:33,040
build the infrastructure and get the 
creative together,

1700
01:14:33,041 --> 01:14:36,790
but we're not going to be financing a 
100 plus million dollar film every year,

1701
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:39,100
so we'll need to partner with people.

1702
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:44,130
But that's essentially what I've spent 
the last 15 years learning how to do is 

1703
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:45,790
the business side of things,
how to build teams,

1704
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:47,320
how to get them pointed in the right 
direction.

1705
01:14:47,321 --> 01:14:48,400
How to think through,
okay,

1706
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:53,401
you've got this grand goal,
you want to make a studio bigger than 

1707
01:14:53,401 --> 01:14:53,401
Disney,
but like what are the real,

1708
01:14:53,401 --> 01:14:57,841
like what are the things you can do 
today to actually take a step towards 

1709
01:14:57,841 --> 01:15:01,261
that?
So it was your desire to do things 

1710
01:15:01,261 --> 01:15:01,261
changed.
Like your,

1711
01:15:01,261 --> 01:15:02,320
your desire is not to create a film 
anymore.

1712
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:07,500
Your desires now to create business,
to create some sort of a large 

1713
01:15:08,351 --> 01:15:11,470
organization sort of so in,
in reality,

1714
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:16,500
my real desires.
I want to pull people out of the Matrix 

1715
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,350
so that what you said before this,
I was trying to work my way back to 

1716
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:19,440
like,
so that's the most sincere thing.

1717
01:15:19,441 --> 01:15:22,660
So the Matrix to me is a set of limiting
beliefs that the vast majority of people

1718
01:15:22,661 --> 01:15:27,661
have to stop them from achieving what 
they could achieve in life if they only 

1719
01:15:27,661 --> 01:15:31,291
understood that humans are the ultimate 
adaptation machine and that we are the 

1720
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:36,390
only animal you can put into any 
environment and we will be able to 

1721
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:36,670
survive and thrive so we can do that.

1722
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:39,670
Sort of give me an example where we 
think,

1723
01:15:39,671 --> 01:15:44,671
well we don't,
we don't survive and thrive and 

1724
01:15:44,671 --> 01:15:45,190
horrifying climates.
Like you bring people to an article,

1725
01:15:45,191 --> 01:15:48,170
they survive.
They certainly don't thrive and they got

1726
01:15:48,171 --> 01:15:49,600
to get out indigenous people,
right?

1727
01:15:49,601 --> 01:15:54,601
So they do and you can.
We can go in and build a research 

1728
01:15:54,601 --> 01:15:58,441
facility.
So some of the adaptation is there's no 

1729
01:15:58,441 --> 01:15:59,320
indigenous people live in Antarctica.
Like what do you mean?

1730
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:01,640
In the Arctic circle as well as 
thinking,

1731
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:03,400
I apologize.
So,

1732
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:05,200
um,
there's two kinds of adaptations.

1733
01:16:05,201 --> 01:16:07,060
So you know,
that women that swam the Bering Strait.

1734
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:10,840
Okay.
So she sleeps with their windows open in

1735
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:12,250
a cold climate,
I forget where she lived.

1736
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:17,640
Um,
basically what she's doing by constant 

1737
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,030
cold exposure is changing her adipose 
tissue to Brown fat.

1738
01:16:19,031 --> 01:16:24,031
So now it's more thermogenic and she can
actually do something that she wasn't 

1739
01:16:24,031 --> 01:16:24,031
able to do.

1740
01:16:24,031 --> 01:16:24,790
And if you're really gonna let me get 
crazy.

1741
01:16:24,791 --> 01:16:29,791
Like looking at what [inaudible] has 
done with his ability to regulate 

1742
01:16:29,791 --> 01:16:33,361
internal temperature is pretty crazy.
And then just what they're discovering 

1743
01:16:33,361 --> 01:16:36,541
with DNA from at one point it was 
considered to be just junk DNA and now 

1744
01:16:36,541 --> 01:16:38,320
they're realizing that it's actually 
epigenetic responders essentially.

1745
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:40,750
So are there limits gap?
Probably,

1746
01:16:40,751 --> 01:16:45,250
but just as like looking at the way that
we only have what,

1747
01:16:45,251 --> 01:16:48,460
20,000
genes and an onion has like 40,000

1748
01:16:48,461 --> 01:16:51,190
genes.
So what is it that makes us more complex

1749
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:52,750
if you will give me that.
We are complex.

1750
01:16:53,050 --> 01:16:55,570
Um,
and it seems to be the,

1751
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,250
what they originally thought was junk 
DNA,

1752
01:16:57,251 --> 01:17:02,251
which is your genes will turn on or off 
express themselves in different amounts 

1753
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:06,451
based on your environment and your diet 
and even some just like how you're 

1754
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:12,331
thinking your microbiome,
like all that stuff then regulates how 

1755
01:17:12,331 --> 01:17:15,401
your genes were expressed and we have a 
much wider ability to adapt to climates 

1756
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:18,500
if you're not going to let me go as 
extreme,

1757
01:17:18,501 --> 01:17:20,540
but we have the widest stability.

1758
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:21,950
Would you agree with that?
Okay.

1759
01:17:21,951 --> 01:17:24,800
So of all the species we have the widest
flexibility.

1760
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Um,
so it's that ability to adapt that I 

1761
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,160
think is,
is one of our greatest strengths.

1762
01:17:31,161 --> 01:17:34,100
I don't remember why I started down my 
path of adaptation,

1763
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,840
but the fact that humans can adapt in 
whatever direction they want.

1764
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:44,710
I began adapting myself through mindset 
and that really showed me how far I was 

1765
01:17:45,741 --> 01:17:47,930
able to come mentally from where I 
started.

1766
01:17:47,931 --> 01:17:52,040
So as I saw what a huge impact it had on
my life,

1767
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:56,510
both emotionally and financially,
I'm becoming a,

1768
01:17:56,540 --> 01:18:00,200
somebody who is entrepreneurial minded,
taking extreme ownership for my life.

1769
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,480
I'm assuming that everything is my 
fault,

1770
01:18:02,481 --> 01:18:04,160
that I can always do something,
I can change something,

1771
01:18:04,161 --> 01:18:05,840
I can get a different result,
I can learn a new skill,

1772
01:18:05,841 --> 01:18:10,841
whatever the case may be,
but that I can turn myself into what I 

1773
01:18:10,841 --> 01:18:12,410
need to be in order to execute at 
anything.

1774
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:17,830
So that changed me so much.
And then I've worked in the inner city 

1775
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:20,120
so much and seen what happens when 
somebody really has limiting beliefs and

1776
01:18:20,121 --> 01:18:22,060
how much that holds them back.
Um,

1777
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:26,210
so I big brothered for a kid in college,
ended up turning into like an eight year

1778
01:18:26,211 --> 01:18:27,660
relationship.
Um,

1779
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:31,580
and so I saw him go through a lot and I 
remember,

1780
01:18:31,581 --> 01:18:36,581
so he grew up in,
in south central and then moved to 

1781
01:18:36,581 --> 01:18:39,101
compton and I remember taking him to see
movies and Beverly Hills just because I 

1782
01:18:39,101 --> 01:18:42,371
wanted him to see beauty.
Like the way in which his worldview had 

1783
01:18:42,371 --> 01:18:44,900
been constructed was so bizarre and 
limiting.

1784
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,540
Um,
there's that song by a guy named,

1785
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:53,590
I forget his name,
but he says they don't want to see you 

1786
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:53,590
when Kodak,
black,

1787
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:54,410
Kodak black have no idea who that is.
So anyway,

1788
01:18:54,411 --> 01:18:59,411
it's a song by a guy named Kodak Black 
and he talks about how they don't want 

1789
01:18:59,411 --> 01:18:59,420
to see you winning and that was his 
mentality,

1790
01:18:59,421 --> 01:19:01,520
like nobody wants to see me get out of 
the ghetto,

1791
01:19:01,521 --> 01:19:01,780
right?

1792
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:03,560
Not My own mother.
Nobody.

1793
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:06,260
So that was his frame of reference was 
just,

1794
01:19:06,261 --> 01:19:07,820
yeah,
well it just wasn't meant for me because

1795
01:19:07,821 --> 01:19:09,830
of where I grew up,
encountered those kids.

1796
01:19:09,831 --> 01:19:11,960
I was telling you about a dad shot to 
death,

1797
01:19:11,961 --> 01:19:14,780
sister shot to death,
like just crazy life.

1798
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,230
And their perspective was very,
very limited.

1799
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:20,000
They had no sense of how they're going 
to make something come true.

1800
01:19:20,001 --> 01:19:22,490
So I want to help people develop an 
empowering mindset.

1801
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:25,880
Disney understood something which is why
I use them as our foil,

1802
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:30,140
which is every piece of content that 
they make feeds into a brand ethos.

1803
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:35,350
So if I say I'm going to go see a Sony 
movie or a Warner Brothers movie or a 

1804
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:35,350
paramount movie,
you know nothing about it.

1805
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:36,920
But if I say I'm going to go see a 
Disney movie,

1806
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:42,100
you already know something.
So we have to have the discipline to 

1807
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,651
make sure that everything that we're 
creating feeds into that and what would 

1808
01:19:44,651 --> 01:19:45,980
that thing you're feeding into be like 
escaping the matrix.

1809
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:50,980
So everything's going to do is going to 
be motivational and some sort of a way 

1810
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:51,080
or inflammation.
It's got to be firing.

1811
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:53,030
It's got to be entertainment first and 
foremost.

1812
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:56,210
But I'll give you examples of movies I 
wish we had created wholesale.

1813
01:19:56,560 --> 01:20:01,560
Um,
I wish impact theory had made the 

1814
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:01,560
matrix.
It's the perfect movie in my opinion.

1815
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:05,800
I wish we'd made star wars.
The whole religion of the Jetta is 

1816
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:05,800
wildly empowering and think,
you know,

1817
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,430
how ridiculous it is to say that you 
wish you made the two greatest movies of

1818
01:20:08,431 --> 01:20:09,860
all time.
Of course you do.

1819
01:20:09,950 --> 01:20:12,310
Right?
But I'm saying from a guitar,

1820
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:14,670
well actually I don't wish we'd made 
avatar.

1821
01:20:14,671 --> 01:20:15,780
So,
um,

1822
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:18,630
honestly I haven't looked at it closely 
enough to know if it falls into that,

1823
01:20:18,631 --> 01:20:21,280
but I don't remember it having it.
That's more of like a,

1824
01:20:21,281 --> 01:20:23,460
a nature theme and taking care of the 
current theme.

1825
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,650
Whereas I'm looking for empowerment 
themes.

1826
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,210
So yeah,
empowerment themes in what?

1827
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:33,480
Like in terms of fiction,
all of it is gone be documentaries,

1828
01:20:33,481 --> 01:20:37,290
like what are you going to try to do?
So mostly as of right now,

1829
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:38,600
entirely fiction.
Um,

1830
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:44,000
and the idea behind that is the way that
humans assimilate truly disruptive 

1831
01:20:44,371 --> 01:20:49,371
information is through narrative and if 
you've read Joseph Campbell's the power 

1832
01:20:49,371 --> 01:20:50,010
of myth,
he talks a lot about that and the hero's

1833
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:55,011
journey and so wanting to leverage that 
and it's not an accident that I was so 

1834
01:20:56,491 --> 01:21:01,491
impacted by the power of myth.
And then Joseph is the one that worked 

1835
01:21:01,491 --> 01:21:05,151
with George Lucas on creating star wars 
and making sure that real hardcore 

1836
01:21:05,151 --> 01:21:08,211
mythology is at the core of it.
So I just think that's how we build our 

1837
01:21:08,211 --> 01:21:09,060
belief system is how we build our 
ideology.

1838
01:21:09,061 --> 01:21:10,590
It's how we pass it on to other people.

1839
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:14,070
And I'm a big believer,
don't try to change behavior,

1840
01:21:14,071 --> 01:21:16,260
try to leverage it.
So people are already reading books,

1841
01:21:16,261 --> 01:21:17,520
reading comic books,
so on and so forth.

1842
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:22,550
It's so weird a motivation to not just 
make things that are entertaining but 

1843
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:27,381
the make things that are entertaining 
that you think are going to be 

1844
01:21:27,381 --> 01:21:27,780
inspiring.
But then to use star wars and the Matrix

1845
01:21:27,781 --> 01:21:32,781
is examples like,
do you think those movies really pulled 

1846
01:21:32,781 --> 01:21:33,750
people out of anything or just entertain
people because I'd be much more inclined

1847
01:21:33,751 --> 01:21:35,130
to think the latter.
Sure.

1848
01:21:35,131 --> 01:21:37,710
So here's how I look at it.
I'm a filtering mechanism.

1849
01:21:37,711 --> 01:21:40,110
I can't save everybody and not everybody
cares.

1850
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:43,830
So some people are going to respond,
some are the matrix changed my life in a

1851
01:21:43,831 --> 01:21:45,670
deep and fundamental way.
So I know the Matrix.

1852
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:46,770
Yeah.
One hundred percent.

1853
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:50,070
How so at the time when I had the fixed 
mindset,

1854
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:51,690
I'm literally right out of college.

1855
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:54,180
I'm into depths of.
I'm not a talented filmmaker.

1856
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:55,630
Now what the hell do I do?
Um,

1857
01:21:55,830 --> 01:21:57,420
I went to a comic con,
uh,

1858
01:21:57,450 --> 01:22:02,450
literally across the street from USC and
they were handing out tickets to go see 

1859
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:07,230
the matrix at Warner brothers studios.
And a very excited.

1860
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:08,430
Took the ticket,
went that night,

1861
01:22:08,431 --> 01:22:10,440
went in.
Do you remember the movie?

1862
01:22:10,441 --> 01:22:11,100
Well?
Oh,

1863
01:22:11,101 --> 01:22:11,970
absolutely.
All right.

1864
01:22:11,971 --> 01:22:14,460
So when a agent Smith Goes,
no,

1865
01:22:14,461 --> 01:22:16,860
officer,
your men are already dead.

1866
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,650
And then they cut to up their trinity 
jumps,

1867
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,900
camera,
go slow motion and spins around her.

1868
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:23,760
The entire audience,
myself included,

1869
01:22:23,761 --> 01:22:27,210
yelled because it was just unlike 
anything we'd ever seen in a movie.

1870
01:22:27,211 --> 01:22:32,211
It was such a rad experience.
And so that primed me for what ends up 

1871
01:22:32,581 --> 01:22:36,120
being the perfect metaphor for limiting 
beliefs.

1872
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,590
And um,
you know,

1873
01:22:37,591 --> 01:22:39,400
Michael Strahan [inaudible].
Alright.

1874
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:42,620
So Michael Strahan said the same thing.
He was like,

1875
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:46,470
the year that he got the award for most 
sacks in a single season was,

1876
01:22:46,530 --> 01:22:50,250
was because of the matrix,
literally his own words.

1877
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:53,070
He came on an impact there.
I interviewed him asking that question.

1878
01:22:53,071 --> 01:22:54,510
He said,
without a doubt,

1879
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:57,360
that movie is the reason that I got the 
record because he said,

1880
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:01,230
up until that moment I see morpheus and 
neo training and Morphea says,

1881
01:23:01,231 --> 01:23:03,000
do you really think that,
um,

1882
01:23:03,001 --> 01:23:04,710
I'm faster than you because of my 
muscles?

1883
01:23:04,711 --> 01:23:05,730
You really,
this is air.

1884
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:08,410
You're breathing.
And straight hand realized,

1885
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:13,500
Holy Shit,
I have a belief that I can only get one 

1886
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:13,660
sack per game,
but why can't I get too?

1887
01:23:13,661 --> 01:23:16,690
Why can't I get three?
And he said because of that he would get

1888
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:17,830
a sack and then go,
no,

1889
01:23:17,831 --> 01:23:19,540
I can get another one.
And he said,

1890
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:24,541
I realized in that moment that once I 
got a second game I would back off 

1891
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:27,280
because I just believed that was like 
the most anyone can do in a game.

1892
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:32,640
So it had a similar impact me,
it made me realize I needed to figure 

1893
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:33,340
out what my,
what is the Matrix,

1894
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:33,470
right?

1895
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,110
I don't actually think we're in a 
simulation.

1896
01:23:35,111 --> 01:23:40,111
So what is the Matrix belief system?
What is my version of jacking in 

1897
01:23:40,111 --> 01:23:43,120
reading?
What is my Kung Fu business like?

1898
01:23:43,121 --> 01:23:44,830
Those were all the things that began to 
sack.

1899
01:23:44,831 --> 01:23:46,720
It wasn't there while I'm sitting in the
movie theater,

1900
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:51,870
but those were the things that were in 
my mind and I just kept thinking about 

1901
01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:51,870
it,
thinking about it,

1902
01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:52,750
thinking about it.
And I think in movies,

1903
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:57,990
so when I give examples,
a lot of times I give examples from 

1904
01:23:57,990 --> 01:23:58,300
movies because they have that impact.
Now,

1905
01:23:58,301 --> 01:24:00,640
the reason that I don't think something 
like this would work,

1906
01:24:00,641 --> 01:24:03,640
and the reason that I think so many 
people have not responded,

1907
01:24:03,641 --> 01:24:07,120
the way that I responded is nobody is 
allowing people to take it seriously.

1908
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:09,580
So social media I think is going to 
change that.

1909
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:12,340
So nobody's allowing people to take it 
seriously.

1910
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:14,320
Everybody brushes it off.
It's just entertainment.

1911
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:18,910
So what do you mean by that?
So Joseph Campbell and the power of myth

1912
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:21,880
talked about.
He was asked by Bill Moyer,

1913
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:24,120
but Maria said,
I've seen it read it.

1914
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,480
Okay?
So when he goes,

1915
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:30,510
what do you think happens to a world 
where people no longer believe in 

1916
01:24:30,510 --> 01:24:31,000
mythology?
And Joseph Campbell said,

1917
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:36,030
you're living through it right now.
And the point being that you have all 

1918
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:38,260
the mythology in the world,
but nobody believes in it anymore.

1919
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,470
Everybody knows star wars in the real.
Everybody knows the matrix isn't real,

1920
01:24:41,471 --> 01:24:45,040
but people actually used to believe that
religion was real.

1921
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:48,670
And so you had this mythological tale,
whether it was you know,

1922
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:51,550
Zeus,
or whether it was Cassandra,

1923
01:24:51,551 --> 01:24:56,551
all the Greek mythology,
whether it was Jesus Christ didn't 

1924
01:24:56,551 --> 01:24:56,560
matter.
People believed it.

1925
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:58,660
They thought it was real and people 
still do.

1926
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:03,750
Correct,
but I would say that that's diminishing 

1927
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:03,750
day over day.

1928
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:03,790
Um,
it's gotten less.

1929
01:25:03,791 --> 01:25:05,830
Will you give me that?
I'm from,

1930
01:25:05,831 --> 01:25:07,810
I'm sure ancient times.
I mean,

1931
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:09,880
I don't know what the current state of 
atheism,

1932
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:14,910
agnosticism and deity worship is.
I would imagine it's probably somewhere 

1933
01:25:15,431 --> 01:25:19,930
in the 50 percent range though.
I won't even challenge that.

1934
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:25,020
I will give you my gut instinct.
My Gut instinct is while people are 

1935
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:29,671
still deeply religious,
they don't believe in the literal word 

1936
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:29,980
as much,
but let's,

1937
01:25:29,981 --> 01:25:34,981
um,
let's google like what percentage of 

1938
01:25:34,981 --> 01:25:38,260
people today consider themselves 
religious versus the past?

1939
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:40,810
So if we get anything,
if get anything there,

1940
01:25:40,811 --> 01:25:43,600
we have people still cling to it because
it's a,

1941
01:25:43,670 --> 01:25:48,670
it's comforting and because the 
uncertainty of existence and the finite 

1942
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:50,590
nature of our life,
it's a,

1943
01:25:50,650 --> 01:25:55,650
it's very disturbing.
That open ended feeling of not knowing 

1944
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:57,190
when it's gonna happen or what's going 
to happen and having some sort of a calm

1945
01:25:57,191 --> 01:26:00,310
and peaceful belief in a,
an overlord.

1946
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:02,240
Like someone was paying attention to 
this whole thing.

1947
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:03,980
It's got a plan.
I'll agree

1948
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:08,980
to that.
My thesis isn't that people don't 

1949
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:10,961
believe in something,
it's that they don't believe in the 

1950
01:26:10,961 --> 01:26:11,690
literal word as much as well.
Yeah.

1951
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:13,130
How about this?
It didn't help me.

1952
01:26:13,490 --> 01:26:17,810
So there are some people out there are.
The numbers are there.

1953
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:23,220
What do we get out of here?
Jeremy affiliated an affiliated rose 

1954
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:26,861
from 2007,
2014 by six point seven percent from 

1955
01:26:26,861 --> 01:26:30,970
2014 from 2007 to seven years.
It rose by six percent identified 

1956
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:35,330
Christian on affiliated,
affiliated.

1957
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,710
Nothing.
Any religion.

1958
01:26:36,711 --> 01:26:37,160
So there,
what?

1959
01:26:37,161 --> 01:26:41,400
Spiritual Christians went from 78 to 70 
time period?

1960
01:26:41,570 --> 01:26:44,270
Seventy eight percent.
Wow.

1961
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:47,420
I think it's American population.
The American population of Christians is

1962
01:26:47,421 --> 01:26:51,190
78 percent to 70 whatever it is.
So it dropped eight percent,

1963
01:26:51,191 --> 01:26:56,191
but still a giant number of people.
That's why you have to say you're a 

1964
01:26:56,191 --> 01:26:57,140
believer in God in order to be 
president.

1965
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:58,550
They still maintain that.

1966
01:26:58,550 --> 01:27:00,650
That's like a,
a necessary thing.

1967
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:03,170
Like if you are a person running for 
president that says,

1968
01:27:03,171 --> 01:27:04,150
I don't know,
know,

1969
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:09,320
I have no idea.
And I'm personally inclined to believe 

1970
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:09,320
that maybe,
uh,

1971
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:12,410
maybe there's no god,
like people would go fucking crazy.

1972
01:27:12,411 --> 01:27:16,460
You would never get to be president.
We have this fundamental desire,

1973
01:27:16,461 --> 01:27:19,790
even if there's zero proof in there,
absolutely is zero proof,

1974
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:24,940
especially when you think about the 
stories in the Bible and some of the 

1975
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:24,940
more preposterous ones.
Um,

1976
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:26,840
there's no proof that any of those ever 
really took place,

1977
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:27,490
isn't it?
I mean,

1978
01:27:27,670 --> 01:27:29,150
it's,
there's no proof that.

1979
01:27:29,151 --> 01:27:32,300
What was the guy that called,
called the she bear to kill the children

1980
01:27:32,301 --> 01:27:35,790
that were mocking him for being bald.
There was a no idea.

1981
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:38,780
Don't know that story.
There was a guy in the Bible that,

1982
01:27:38,781 --> 01:27:43,781
uh,
these kids were giving them a hard time 

1983
01:27:43,781 --> 01:27:43,781
for being bald.
So,

1984
01:27:43,781 --> 01:27:43,890
uh,
he,

1985
01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:48,910
he called upon God to avenge him and God
sent a bear to kill the children that 

1986
01:27:49,221 --> 01:27:50,480
were mocking him.
Yeah,

1987
01:27:50,481 --> 01:27:52,010
that's intense.
That's what Eliza.

1988
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,310
Uh,
yeah.

1989
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:55,820
Alyssa,
how say that?

1990
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:57,340
Alicia.
Alicia.

1991
01:27:57,370 --> 01:27:58,750
Alicia.
Yeah.

1992
01:27:58,751 --> 01:28:01,630
He went up to Bethel as he walked on the
road.

1993
01:28:01,631 --> 01:28:03,940
Some boys came from the city and mocked 
him.

1994
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:05,900
And,
uh,

1995
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:09,880
when they mocked him,
God sent a bear.

1996
01:28:09,990 --> 01:28:12,700
And the bear fucking killed the kids.
Why?

1997
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:14,010
Eh?
There's,

1998
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:16,930
there's no guessing that didn't happen.
Kids.

1999
01:28:17,530 --> 01:28:20,090
I'm guessing that a Godson,
such a piece of shit that he has,

2000
01:28:20,290 --> 01:28:23,050
sends a bear to kill little children.
How about the kids?

2001
01:28:23,051 --> 01:28:28,051
Just,
they were talking shit about this guy 

2002
01:28:28,051 --> 01:28:30,271
being bald.
I didn't know it was a bear with 

2003
01:28:30,271 --> 01:28:31,731
sneaking up on them.
More likely to know when you're talking 

2004
01:28:31,731 --> 01:28:31,731
about your shit,
you make noise.

2005
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:32,740
The bears realize,
oh,

2006
01:28:32,741 --> 01:28:35,350
he's a high pitched noises,
probably delicious little kids.

2007
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:39,760
And then they moved in but still 70 
percent men.

2008
01:28:40,090 --> 01:28:44,530
So it's less people believe,
but still that's a giant number.

2009
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,600
It is.
It is a giant number.

2010
01:28:49,670 --> 01:28:52,950
So yeah,
I mean that's a good question.

2011
01:28:52,951 --> 01:28:55,450
Like how many of them actually believe,
you know,

2012
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:57,550
and what to what to what extent.
Right?

2013
01:28:57,650 --> 01:28:58,980
And what is it they actually believe.

2014
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:02,700
Yeah.
So something,

2015
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:05,190
uh,
my thesis is that something's wrong.

2016
01:29:05,530 --> 01:29:06,570
Uh,
this isn't uh,

2017
01:29:06,571 --> 01:29:09,480
an anti religion thing for me.
I have no beef with religion.

2018
01:29:09,481 --> 01:29:12,660
If it's making people positive and 
connecting and doing something great,

2019
01:29:12,661 --> 01:29:15,750
I'm all for it.
I am not a religious person.

2020
01:29:16,110 --> 01:29:21,110
Um,
and so maybe I needed this for me to 

2021
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:23,970
have something that could give me the 
ideology that I needed a reading.

2022
01:29:23,971 --> 01:29:25,920
The power of myth really changed my 
life.

2023
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:31,700
I read it and he talks about in the book
how I'm basically one of the things he 

2024
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:37,701
thinks is going wrong with divorce and 
the reason that divorce rates are so 

2025
01:29:37,701 --> 01:29:40,551
high is that ritual has really lost its 
impact and you don't have these 

2026
01:29:40,551 --> 01:29:43,821
demarcation points between childhood and
adulthood or between being single and 

2027
01:29:43,821 --> 01:29:44,250
being married.
And he was like,

2028
01:29:44,251 --> 01:29:45,660
you know,
back in the day when you were 13,

2029
01:29:45,661 --> 01:29:46,530
they took you out of the woods.

2030
01:29:46,530 --> 01:29:48,990
They literally ripped you from the 
clutches of the women,

2031
01:29:48,991 --> 01:29:53,991
took you out at with no anesthetic.
They would circumcise you and now you 

2032
01:29:53,991 --> 01:29:53,991
know,
like you're a man.

2033
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,140
So because there's none of that,
you get arrested adolescence and there's

2034
01:29:58,470 --> 01:30:00,990
sort of a weakening of the,
um,

2035
01:30:01,290 --> 01:30:06,290
the,
the import of the religious ceremony as 

2036
01:30:06,290 --> 01:30:09,201
far as divorce goes.
And so people aren't taking that 

2037
01:30:09,201 --> 01:30:09,201
seriously.
So.

2038
01:30:09,201 --> 01:30:10,290
And he talks about ritualistic scarf,
vacation and how many,

2039
01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:15,310
you knew something had changed.
When people put your body through some 

2040
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:15,780
kind of transformation.
So when I got married,

2041
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:20,870
I went through a ritualistic 
scarification to remind myself that I 

2042
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:23,250
was a different man the day before.
What kind of a ritualistic scarification

2043
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:27,960
did you go through a tattoo?
A grandiose way.

2044
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:31,430
But here,
how dare you call it?

2045
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:32,840
Scarf.
Vacation.

2046
01:30:33,210 --> 01:30:34,560
That's how I saw it.
So I don't,

2047
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:35,430
I don't do tattoos.

2048
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:40,430
You'll see nothing.
I have one tattoo which I did 

2049
01:30:40,430 --> 01:30:40,430
specifically for my wedding.
I've never gotten another one.

2050
01:30:40,610 --> 01:30:45,610
Um,
and at the time this isn't the case 

2051
01:30:45,610 --> 01:30:47,811
anymore,
but at the time one of my biggest sort 

2052
01:30:47,811 --> 01:30:49,731
of realistic fears was needles.
So it was me saying to my wife,

2053
01:30:50,341 --> 01:30:53,400
I'm going to go scar my body.
I'm using needles,

2054
01:30:53,401 --> 01:30:57,450
which freak me the fuck out to remind 
myself,

2055
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,910
hey,
I want it to be painful and then be.

2056
01:30:59,911 --> 01:31:04,911
I want it to be permanent.
And I'm glad that it's something that I 

2057
01:31:04,911 --> 01:31:06,060
have this active fear of.
So in doing all of that,

2058
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:10,470
it really did make the whole wedding 
just a bigger deal to me.

2059
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:15,530
And so that's really interesting.
But I think when we're talking about 

2060
01:31:15,530 --> 01:31:18,381
Joseph Campbell and the,
the issues that I think are very real 

2061
01:31:18,381 --> 01:31:21,591
about people not experiencing like a 
grand event or at least some sort of a 

2062
01:31:21,591 --> 01:31:23,760
ritual that gets them to adulthood.

2063
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:26,220
Um,
I think there's,

2064
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:31,600
this is a significant issue that we have
with just things being far too easy and 

2065
01:31:31,951 --> 01:31:36,510
that there's no real difficult path 
where the warrior has to find themselves

2066
01:31:36,511 --> 01:31:37,060
in,
you know,

2067
01:31:37,110 --> 01:31:41,340
in myth or in,
in a person's actual life that they have

2068
01:31:41,341 --> 01:31:44,850
to overcome some very difficult thing.
Now for you,

2069
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:48,600
I'm sure some of those,
I mean we all have difficulties in life,

2070
01:31:48,601 --> 01:31:51,330
but some of the difficulties that you 
experienced when you were in film school

2071
01:31:51,331 --> 01:31:53,910
was like this creation of this thing,
you know,

2072
01:31:53,911 --> 01:31:57,300
but once you try to create this thing 
and it didn't work out,

2073
01:31:57,301 --> 01:31:58,420
right,
do you,

2074
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:00,100
don't you have this desire to

2075
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,660
go back and try to figure it out,
right?

2076
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:03,010
Like,
don't you have to design like,

2077
01:32:03,011 --> 01:32:04,840
okay,
like I see where I fuck this up.

2078
01:32:04,841 --> 01:32:08,110
I try to be like John Wu instead of 
trying to be like Alfred Hitchcock and I

2079
01:32:08,111 --> 01:32:10,690
see that there's like a way you could be
systematic.

2080
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:13,660
You're obviously a systematic thinker 
like you're talking about,

2081
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:15,370
you're,
you're an organizer,

2082
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:20,550
you have all these quotes in your mind 
and you have all these systems that you 

2083
01:32:20,550 --> 01:32:20,550
follow,
including,

2084
01:32:20,550 --> 01:32:24,481
like following,
like some of Gary vee social media 

2085
01:32:24,481 --> 01:32:24,481
stuff,
right.

2086
01:32:24,481 --> 01:32:27,670
It's like your assistant.
You fall like these are ways to engage 

2087
01:32:27,670 --> 01:32:27,670
in success.
Right?

2088
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:28,180
So

2089
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:32,040
I would feel like that would haunt you a
little bit.

2090
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:34,830
It's interesting.
It doesn't.

2091
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:39,150
So since then I have done,
I have done a low budget feature film.

2092
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:39,720
Oh,
okay.

2093
01:32:39,830 --> 01:32:44,830
Um,
I wrote a screenplay that was turned 

2094
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:46,020
into a feature film that was a 
horrifying experience.

2095
01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:51,050
Why was that?
Just because it didn't turn out the way 

2096
01:32:51,050 --> 01:32:51,450
that I wanted it to.
It wasn't executed as written.

2097
01:32:51,451 --> 01:32:51,780
I mean,
look,

2098
01:32:51,781 --> 01:32:54,090
this is the age fighters complaint,
so,

2099
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:56,010
um,
but I've,

2100
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I have changed as a person over time to 
where I'm just now way more interested 

2101
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:06,390
in scale.
So I still have that love for cinema.

2102
01:33:06,391 --> 01:33:09,180
I love storytelling.
I think story is a,

2103
01:33:09,390 --> 01:33:14,390
it is a way that we assimilate 
information like that is when I think 

2104
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:18,111
about the things that have painted a 
vision for me of what is a man came way 

2105
01:33:18,751 --> 01:33:23,700
more for movies and say my own father,
so and that that is not to downplay like

2106
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:26,690
having a relationship with somebody that
you're in proximity with is,

2107
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:29,130
is ultimately I think it'd be the most 
powerful thing.

2108
01:33:29,130 --> 01:33:34,130
It's just not scalable.
So looking at how impactful media has 

2109
01:33:34,130 --> 01:33:38,931
been for me and for a lot of people and 
this whole notion of self signaling 

2110
01:33:38,931 --> 01:33:43,820
because at the end of the day,
the way that I see the company is we're 

2111
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:47,580
a merchandise company,
so you create the intellectual property.

2112
01:33:47,581 --> 01:33:49,440
I mean this is a out of Disney's 
playbook.

2113
01:33:49,441 --> 01:33:53,640
You create the intellectual property in 
order to create the merchandise and this

2114
01:33:53,650 --> 01:33:55,320
and merchandise that drives a lot of the
revenue.

2115
01:33:55,321 --> 01:34:00,321
Not all of it,
but it drives a lot of the revenue and 

2116
01:34:00,321 --> 01:34:03,860
in having that,
you also create this thing called self 

2117
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:08,331
signaling.
So as I dress a certain way to tell you 

2118
01:34:08,331 --> 01:34:08,331
something,
which is how it starts,

2119
01:34:08,331 --> 01:34:10,200
it also tells me even more loudly than 
you.

2120
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:15,440
So as I like,
I have a Batman shirt and I have a 

2121
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:15,440
superman shirt and when I wear those 
shirts,

2122
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,940
it reminds me of my tie to that ethos,
right?

2123
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:19,920
So Batman is.
You don't have any superpowers,

2124
01:34:19,950 --> 01:34:21,240
motherfucker.
You just have to work really,

2125
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:26,270
really hard and you've got to be 
prepared to tap into the dark side to 

2126
01:34:26,270 --> 01:34:28,260
keep pushing hard enough to avenge what 
you believe is your failing.

2127
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:32,190
So Superman,
it's a perfect analogy for passion,

2128
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:37,220
right?
He's a normal guy except when he's in 

2129
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:39,561
the Yellow Sun.
And that gave me a way to think about 

2130
01:34:39,561 --> 01:34:40,590
getting in line with my passion.
I remember I was obsessed with that.

2131
01:34:40,591 --> 01:34:42,450
When I decided to go in and quit,
I was like,

2132
01:34:42,451 --> 01:34:47,451
I'm like Superman and I am out of the 
Yellow Sun because I'm not passionate 

2133
01:34:47,451 --> 01:34:51,231
about anything.
And the only time that I can do things 

2134
01:34:51,231 --> 01:34:53,031
that make me feel that,
that are extraordinary or when I'm 

2135
01:34:53,031 --> 01:34:55,641
really passionate,
the Matrix obviously is like the core 

2136
01:34:55,641 --> 01:34:56,850
metaphor for my entire existence.
So what is such a crazy thing to.

2137
01:34:57,700 --> 01:34:59,300
Yeah.
So weird thing.

2138
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:02,810
The Matrix is the wow,
the core metaphor,

2139
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:04,280
right guys?
It's a metaphor,

2140
01:35:05,030 --> 01:35:06,560
but it's,
it's a core metaphor.

2141
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:11,620
And not to be Joseph Campbell at that 
didn't expect him to come out of my 

2142
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:14,861
mouth as many times in this interview,
but he said if you want to change the 

2143
01:35:14,861 --> 01:35:14,861
world,
you have to change the metaphor.

2144
01:35:14,861 --> 01:35:19,780
So.
And people have talked a lot about that 

2145
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:19,780
with the,
how the world changed in the metaphor of

2146
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:21,170
the steam engine to the metaphor of the 
computer.

2147
01:35:21,390 --> 01:35:22,310
Uh,
and that just,

2148
01:35:22,370 --> 01:35:27,370
it changed the way that you thought 
about workers that changed what you 

2149
01:35:27,370 --> 01:35:28,490
thought about intelligence and just 
changed a lot of things just by shifting

2150
01:35:28,491 --> 01:35:30,620
from one metaphor to the next.
Um,

2151
01:35:30,621 --> 01:35:35,540
so dealing in the realm of metaphor,
giving people access points to different

2152
01:35:35,541 --> 01:35:39,080
things through storytelling,
which obviously is riding on the back of

2153
01:35:39,081 --> 01:35:42,560
metaphor I think is an incredible access
point,

2154
01:35:42,590 --> 01:35:45,140
but more importantly,
it's something people already do.

2155
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:50,440
So you're leveraging behavior that's 
already there and that was like a 

2156
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:50,510
necessary part.
The same thing with quest,

2157
01:35:50,511 --> 01:35:55,511
right?
Don't ask people to eat less and 

2158
01:35:55,511 --> 01:35:57,611
exercise more.
We've been telling them that for 60 

2159
01:35:57,611 --> 01:35:59,501
years,
whatever it works for a narrow band of 

2160
01:35:59,501 --> 01:35:59,501
the population,
but it doesn't work for everybody.

2161
01:35:59,501 --> 01:36:00,920
So finding something that people are 
already doing,

2162
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:03,380
people are already watching movies,
TV shows,

2163
01:36:03,381 --> 01:36:04,610
playing video games,
reading books,

2164
01:36:04,611 --> 01:36:09,611
comic books are already doing it.
They're billions and billions of dollar 

2165
01:36:09,611 --> 01:36:09,611
industries.
Um,

2166
01:36:09,611 --> 01:36:12,830
so being able to tap into that leverage 
social media now.

2167
01:36:12,831 --> 01:36:15,320
So this is where we first got onto this 
part where I was saying,

2168
01:36:15,590 --> 01:36:19,190
you're in a position where most people 
don't take it seriously.

2169
01:36:19,191 --> 01:36:21,080
They don't try to extract the life 
lessons.

2170
01:36:21,081 --> 01:36:25,030
They're not Michael Strahan,
they don't see a movie one time,

2171
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:30,040
but just didn't show it.
They just go to see a film to be 

2172
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:30,040
entertained.

2173
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,580
This is a fascinating approach though,
to to create films,

2174
01:36:31,581 --> 01:36:34,190
to change the way human beings think 
about life,

2175
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:36,800
but now keep in mind if we don't 
entertain first and foremost,

2176
01:36:36,801 --> 01:36:41,801
we've got nothing so people need to be 
able to watch the movies and have no 

2177
01:36:41,801 --> 01:36:43,400
idea that there's a message.
Disney is a perfect example of that.

2178
01:36:43,401 --> 01:36:44,660
Disney is trying to tell you that,
right?

2179
01:36:44,661 --> 01:36:47,330
Should always win bad.
They make movies for children.

2180
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:48,870
Sure.
I mean it's,

2181
01:36:48,890 --> 01:36:52,040
it's a different thing like organizing 
something like that.

2182
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:57,070
A grand scale to make films for humans 
that you think can pull them out of the 

2183
01:36:57,070 --> 01:36:58,910
matrix through.
Do you think this works for kids,

2184
01:36:58,911 --> 01:37:01,580
but only kids.
I don't think kids are a little bit more

2185
01:37:01,581 --> 01:37:03,830
pliable and they don't have enough 
information.

2186
01:37:03,831 --> 01:37:07,310
Sometimes you can show them,
show them some things through,

2187
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:09,470
you know,
cartoons and things along those lines.

2188
01:37:10,050 --> 01:37:12,170
Set in with them a little bit easier and
better.

2189
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:17,280
I mean,
it's absolutely possible to send a 

2190
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:17,280
message through a film that really 
radiates with people,

2191
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:21,941
resonates with people because I have a 
deep and abiding fear that this is only 

2192
01:37:21,941 --> 01:37:21,941
going to work with kids.
Really?

2193
01:37:21,941 --> 01:37:23,390
Yeah.
I don't know that that's true,

2194
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:24,530
but there's a guide,
you know,

2195
01:37:24,531 --> 01:37:25,850
Jeffrey Canada,
no,

2196
01:37:25,910 --> 01:37:27,470
super cool dude,
um,

2197
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:31,160
grows up in Harlem and realizes,
do the school system is fucked.

2198
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:34,790
Like everyone is just given up on all of
us here in Harlem,

2199
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:37,040
but he's super bright.
Ends up going to Harvard and says,

2200
01:37:37,041 --> 01:37:42,041
I'm going to become a doctor.
I'm going to go back and change the 

2201
01:37:42,041 --> 01:37:43,790
education system and does that.
Goes back and spends,

2202
01:37:43,791 --> 01:37:46,430
I don't know how many years in the 
education system and just realizes,

2203
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:48,110
yeah,
this never gonna work.

2204
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:50,300
You can't change it from the inside.
There are so many.

2205
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:53,750
Politics is so much entrenched.
Bullshit like this is going nowhere.

2206
01:37:53,990 --> 01:37:58,990
So he leaves and decides that he's going
to give up on adults and he's going to 

2207
01:38:00,121 --> 01:38:01,560
start with kids.
In fact,

2208
01:38:01,590 --> 01:38:06,590
not even that he's going to try to find 
women who are about to become pregnant 

2209
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:10,130
and all he wants to do is because he 
looked at what makes a middle class kid 

2210
01:38:10,361 --> 01:38:13,590
successful versus an inner city kid who 
goes on to not be successful.

2211
01:38:13,591 --> 01:38:17,070
What's the difference?
And what he found was it's the number of

2212
01:38:17,071 --> 01:38:19,020
words that a child hears before the age 
of five,

2213
01:38:19,021 --> 01:38:21,570
I think it is,
and the ratio of positive to negative.

2214
01:38:21,571 --> 01:38:23,100
He said,
your average kid in the middle class,

2215
01:38:23,101 --> 01:38:26,700
here's $5 million words for the time 
that he's five 70 percent of positive,

2216
01:38:26,701 --> 01:38:29,310
30 percent of negative.
Whereas in the inner city kid,

2217
01:38:29,311 --> 01:38:34,311
here's like two or 3 million by the time
that they are five and the the ratio is 

2218
01:38:34,311 --> 01:38:34,311
reversed.

2219
01:38:34,311 --> 01:38:36,360
So it's 30 percent positive,
70 percent negative.

2220
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:39,300
So we said that's,
I'm just going to make my life's mission

2221
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:42,280
solving that problem.
So that's an issue.

2222
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:44,130
That's a gigantic issue.
Massive.

2223
01:38:44,131 --> 01:38:49,131
And he said what happens is the language
centers in the brain just don't develop 

2224
01:38:49,131 --> 01:38:51,921
properly and because of that they 
struggle later in life trying to get a 

2225
01:38:51,921 --> 01:38:51,921
job because they can't communicate as 
well.

2226
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:57,260
Um,
so he felt like he had just put his 

2227
01:38:57,260 --> 01:38:59,571
finger on sort of that baseline.
But the reason I bring Geoffrey Canada 

2228
01:38:59,571 --> 01:39:00,330
up is because he gave up on adults.
So as I'm thinking through this,

2229
01:39:00,331 --> 01:39:01,500
look,
we haven't executed on this.

2230
01:39:01,501 --> 01:39:02,850
Nobody should be taking me seriously 
right now.

2231
01:39:02,851 --> 01:39:06,120
I know that.
So I've got like this and I'm like,

2232
01:39:06,150 --> 01:39:08,640
everybody told us we were crazy when we 
said we're launching a protein bar.

2233
01:39:08,641 --> 01:39:09,400
People like,
motherfucker,

2234
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:10,680
you stupid.
1,600

2235
01:39:10,681 --> 01:39:14,460
protein bars in 2009.
It is the most crowded space ever.

2236
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:16,890
One guy actually told us I need another 
protein bar.

2237
01:39:16,891 --> 01:39:21,891
Like I needed another hole in the head.
And then five years later we're inc 

2238
01:39:21,891 --> 01:39:23,890
502nd fastest growing company in North 
America grew by 57,000

2239
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:24,600
percent.
How?

2240
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:26,520
Because we believed that it could be 
done right.

2241
01:39:26,521 --> 01:39:31,521
So I get it.
People think you made a good product 

2242
01:39:31,521 --> 01:39:32,510
also for enjoying it.
And that's what they wanted and that's

2243
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:37,580
Kinda the same thing with making films,
like you have to make a good product 

2244
01:39:37,580 --> 01:39:38,610
that people are going to enjoy,
but it's a fascinating thing that you're

2245
01:39:38,730 --> 01:39:43,730
coming to it saying that you want to 
change people and take them out of the 

2246
01:39:43,730 --> 01:39:44,220
Matrix because you're also saying that 
your,

2247
01:39:44,790 --> 01:39:49,080
your like a memorabilia company or a 
merchandise merchandise company.

2248
01:39:49,081 --> 01:39:50,310
I mean,
that's kind of the same thing,

2249
01:39:50,311 --> 01:39:51,390
right?
It's like you're,

2250
01:39:51,391 --> 01:39:56,391
you're,
you're talking like objects that go 

2251
01:39:56,391 --> 01:39:57,000
along with your films.
And that's a big part of what.

2252
01:39:57,140 --> 01:39:59,940
So you're planning all this out from a 
financial standpoint,

2253
01:39:59,941 --> 01:40:02,070
right?
But what about a creative standpoint?

2254
01:40:02,071 --> 01:40:05,190
Like continue to be able to put together
all these ideas,

2255
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:06,060
like to say,
oh,

2256
01:40:06,061 --> 01:40:07,440
I want to make the new matrix.
Oh,

2257
01:40:07,441 --> 01:40:12,441
I want to make the new star wars and I 
want to change the world on a drag 

2258
01:40:12,441 --> 01:40:14,040
people out of this mundane reality they 
live in and show them the power of myth,

2259
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:16,050
right?
Yeah.

2260
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:17,670
More.
I want to show them the power of belief.

2261
01:40:17,671 --> 01:40:19,680
I don't think they're ever going to see 
the power of myth.

2262
01:40:19,950 --> 01:40:21,300
Why would they see it?
If you could see it?

2263
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:22,600
Maybe they will.
I don't know,

2264
01:40:22,660 --> 01:40:27,660
just not a focus for me.
I just want them to take the usable 

2265
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:31,041
mindset and apply it and I think that we
live in an interesting time now where 

2266
01:40:31,041 --> 01:40:33,330
social media can comment on the things 
and say,

2267
01:40:33,331 --> 01:40:34,470
here's what's extractable from

2268
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:36,600
so will you try to adjust films 
accordingly?

2269
01:40:36,810 --> 01:40:41,810
If someone comes to you with an idea and
a script and they want this project to 

2270
01:40:41,810 --> 01:40:45,051
be created,
you try to adjust it accordingly and to 

2271
01:40:45,051 --> 01:40:45,780
try to have the highest amount of impact
and like how you going

2272
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:46,720
do that?
Yeah.

2273
01:40:46,721 --> 01:40:51,721
So hopefully it will be a beacon to 
people that really understand the 

2274
01:40:51,721 --> 01:40:54,160
mindset.
So we laid out a three phase to building

2275
01:40:54,161 --> 01:40:59,161
the studio on the website literally from
day one and phase one is build the 

2276
01:40:59,161 --> 01:41:03,241
community.
So we're building a community around 

2277
01:41:03,241 --> 01:41:03,241
ideology.
People that come and listen.

2278
01:41:03,241 --> 01:41:03,370
In fact,
this is how you and I connected.

2279
01:41:03,371 --> 01:41:04,870
So one of my,
um,

2280
01:41:04,871 --> 01:41:08,260
one of the people that follows my show 
wrote to you and said,

2281
01:41:08,261 --> 01:41:13,261
Joe,
you really got to get this guy in your 

2282
01:41:13,261 --> 01:41:13,261
show.
And sent you a clip and you said,

2283
01:41:13,261 --> 01:41:13,261
hey,
this is actually pretty interesting.

2284
01:41:13,261 --> 01:41:13,261
You should come on.
Um,

2285
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:16,510
so that's all around ideology,
right?

2286
01:41:16,511 --> 01:41:20,800
So I've spent the last 20 plus years of 
my life constructing my mindset to allow

2287
01:41:20,801 --> 01:41:24,730
me to be successful and because I've had
a certain level of success,

2288
01:41:24,731 --> 01:41:25,690
people take me seriously.

2289
01:41:25,690 --> 01:41:30,690
So now what I'm trying to do is just 
find the most efficacious way to 

2290
01:41:30,690 --> 01:41:32,380
actually get that ideology in people's 
hands.

2291
01:41:32,381 --> 01:41:36,280
And I know if I can incept them in 
entertainment,

2292
01:41:36,460 --> 01:41:39,460
I've got a shot.
But if I can't entertain them first,

2293
01:41:39,461 --> 01:41:44,461
I've got nothing.
So if we don't have any way to sneak it 

2294
01:41:44,461 --> 01:41:44,461
in,
if we don't have good movies,

2295
01:41:44,461 --> 01:41:44,461
like,
I mean,

2296
01:41:44,470 --> 01:41:49,470
I think this is where you were going to.
The movies aren't just good in and of 

2297
01:41:49,470 --> 01:41:49,470
themselves.
Like we're fucked.

2298
01:41:49,470 --> 01:41:54,210
We've got nothing.
So we have to get really good at making 

2299
01:41:54,210 --> 01:41:55,570
really good movies that people want to 
see for their own sake.

2300
01:41:55,810 --> 01:41:58,450
So that.
And that's a Herculean task.

2301
01:41:58,451 --> 01:42:03,451
No question.
And we're going to have to assemble an 

2302
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:05,020
amazing creative team that really 
understands that a very deep level,

2303
01:42:05,021 --> 01:42:06,310
the ideology of the company,

2304
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:08,980
well in and of itself,
making entertaining films,

2305
01:42:08,981 --> 01:42:11,320
like having a company that makes 
entertaining films with difficult,

2306
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:14,140
brutal make entertaining films that have
this sort of life changing

2307
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:19,140
message don't envy you.
That sounds like a long task.

2308
01:42:20,780 --> 01:42:21,790
But as like,
hey look,

2309
01:42:21,791 --> 01:42:26,791
it can be done if Disney did it.
And arguably they certainly did with 

2310
01:42:26,791 --> 01:42:26,791
kids,

2311
01:42:26,791 --> 01:42:27,070
you know,
I mean they've,

2312
01:42:27,110 --> 01:42:30,260
they've made some really powerful movies
with some really good messages.

2313
01:42:31,010 --> 01:42:32,360
No question,
no question.

2314
01:42:32,420 --> 01:42:33,770
And look,
it's going to be a bumpy road.

2315
01:42:33,771 --> 01:42:38,771
I know that there's going to be sick.
Well the guaranteed failure and 

2316
01:42:38,771 --> 01:42:42,071
hopefully success,
but it's something that I believe in 

2317
01:42:42,071 --> 01:42:43,580
enough to fight for it.
So when you talk about,

2318
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:44,730
you know,
um,

2319
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:48,620
don't you want to go back and sort of 
make good on the filmmaking promise?

2320
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:49,790
No,
not,

2321
01:42:49,791 --> 01:42:50,940
not,
not know what it meant.

2322
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:54,080
What I meant was not,
there's no promise I just went,

2323
01:42:54,220 --> 01:42:56,910
does it something that you think like,
hmm,

2324
01:42:56,911 --> 01:42:58,860
maybe I could have adjusted.
Maybe I could have done this,

2325
01:42:59,110 --> 01:43:04,110
if it could have built on my skill set,
maybe I could have continued making 

2326
01:43:04,110 --> 01:43:05,520
films and tried different approaches and
I feel like,

2327
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:08,430
you know,
if you had a real passion for and it was

2328
01:43:08,431 --> 01:43:09,860
something that you were so interested 
in,

2329
01:43:09,870 --> 01:43:14,870
you said you were killing it early on in
your film career or in your film school 

2330
01:43:14,870 --> 01:43:16,170
career,
like a wonder why you didn't continue to

2331
01:43:16,171 --> 01:43:19,090
try to readjust and try to try to come 
back as another.

2332
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:19,440
Otherwise

2333
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:21,470
that as well.
I think everyone,

2334
01:43:21,471 --> 01:43:23,110
myself included thought,
you know,

2335
01:43:23,170 --> 01:43:25,640
when we had this success equest and now 
I can do whatever I wanted,

2336
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:29,720
that I would just immediately start 
writing and directing and it just didn't

2337
01:43:29,721 --> 01:43:32,650
feel it wasn't what I wanted to do it.
Yeah.

2338
01:43:32,730 --> 01:43:35,940
Well that's an important message in and 
of itself because I tell people,

2339
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:36,310
you know,
like,

2340
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,790
look,
follow your heart's content and don't be

2341
01:43:38,791 --> 01:43:43,791
trapped in your earliest ideas.
If you have an idea early on that you 

2342
01:43:43,791 --> 01:43:48,471
know,
I'm going to become this and then 

2343
01:43:48,471 --> 01:43:50,361
somewhere along the line you discover 
this new interest that kind of 

2344
01:43:50,361 --> 01:43:50,460
supersedes the other one and surpasses 
it.

2345
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:52,340
Follow that one.
No,

2346
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:53,370
you don't.
You don't have.

2347
01:43:53,590 --> 01:43:54,320
You don't have to.
Oh,

2348
01:43:54,321 --> 01:43:56,360
I thought you were a filmmaker.
I was a little.

2349
01:43:56,361 --> 01:43:57,270
Well,
you know,

2350
01:43:57,271 --> 01:43:58,730
like he can do whatever the fuck you 
want.

2351
01:43:58,731 --> 01:44:03,731
I mean you could find a million 
different pathways and a million 

2352
01:44:03,731 --> 01:44:06,881
different avenues,
but ultimately what's going to resonate 

2353
01:44:06,881 --> 01:44:09,671
the most with people,
something that you're actually 

2354
01:44:09,671 --> 01:44:09,671
passionate about and really feel it 
really feel not faking it.

2355
01:44:09,671 --> 01:44:14,650
Not trying to establish some sort of a 
narrative that you think is going to be 

2356
01:44:14,650 --> 01:44:14,960
successful with people resonate with 
people,

2357
01:44:14,961 --> 01:44:18,560
but what do you actually feel and if you
could figure that out,

2358
01:44:18,561 --> 01:44:18,890
man.

2359
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:20,050
No,
that's a.

2360
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:23,690
That seems to be like the great pieces 
of art.

2361
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:28,720
The great works that people have created
that the opportunities that I've gotten 

2362
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:30,770
a chance to talk to people that have 
done some pretty amazing shit.

2363
01:44:31,070 --> 01:44:33,440
It's all they.
It was all like an interest.

2364
01:44:33,441 --> 01:44:38,441
It was all a thought that they had that 
they followed through all the way and 

2365
01:44:38,441 --> 01:44:39,220
then got immersed in it,
you know,

2366
01:44:39,350 --> 01:44:44,350
but it was never thinking about it in 
terms of the ultimate eventual result,

2367
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:46,820
you know?
That's why I think it's interesting that

2368
01:44:46,821 --> 01:44:51,821
you're approaching this and you don't 
just have an idea to make something 

2369
01:44:51,821 --> 01:44:54,500
creative and,
and fascinating and fulfilling to enjoy,

2370
01:44:54,770 --> 01:44:59,770
but you also want to establish some sort
of a narrative that changes the way 

2371
01:44:59,770 --> 01:45:01,190
people look at the reality around them.

2372
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:03,010
Yeah,
definitely.

2373
01:45:03,310 --> 01:45:08,310
And when I,
when I think about what I'm really 

2374
01:45:08,310 --> 01:45:10,441
driven by,
and this was almost a confession to my 

2375
01:45:10,441 --> 01:45:13,801
team was I don't care about.
I love movies and I love the path that 

2376
01:45:14,561 --> 01:45:19,561
we're on right now,
but I don't love it enough to risk my 

2377
01:45:19,561 --> 01:45:20,110
fortune and to work as hard as I'm 
working.

2378
01:45:20,350 --> 01:45:23,050
That just never would have drawn me 
back.

2379
01:45:23,140 --> 01:45:28,140
So what I do care enough about to put 
everything at risk and to work as hard 

2380
01:45:28,271 --> 01:45:33,220
as I'm working is pulling people out of 
the Matrix and I know those are my words

2381
01:45:33,221 --> 01:45:35,740
that maybe don't get people to see what 
I mean.

2382
01:45:35,741 --> 01:45:38,260
So the kid that I big brothered for her,
just to give you an idea.

2383
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:43,620
So his name is rashawn an amazing kid.
He was very disruptive in class.

2384
01:45:43,991 --> 01:45:46,330
He was drug and alcohol impacted but 
still really bright,

2385
01:45:46,331 --> 01:45:48,070
but they had them on like Ritalin or 
something.

2386
01:45:48,070 --> 01:45:50,380
I honestly don't know what,
but it's done to this gross groceries.

2387
01:45:50,381 --> 01:45:52,710
Really small,
hyper aggressive.

2388
01:45:53,470 --> 01:45:57,610
He was adopted and his mother was 
abusing him,

2389
01:45:57,611 --> 01:46:01,060
but I didn't know that and very sad.
It was just too young and I just,

2390
01:46:01,061 --> 01:46:06,061
I didn't know what was going on.
Even though looking back you suddenly 

2391
01:46:06,061 --> 01:46:06,061
realized,
Holy Hell,

2392
01:46:06,061 --> 01:46:06,570
there was so many clues.
Um,

2393
01:46:06,790 --> 01:46:11,790
but I didn't pick up on them and he just
living a life that is,

2394
01:46:12,190 --> 01:46:17,190
um,
is horrible and growing up in the inner 

2395
01:46:17,190 --> 01:46:21,001
cities as well on top of all that.
And so I come and of course he's the 

2396
01:46:21,001 --> 01:46:25,861
student they give me and all I'm 
supposed to do is for eight weeks I'm 

2397
01:46:25,861 --> 01:46:25,861
just supposed to come in and help him do
his homework.

2398
01:46:25,990 --> 01:46:30,990
And so he's very clever.
So I would show up and for an hour he 

2399
01:46:30,990 --> 01:46:30,990
would ignore me.
He would get in fights,

2400
01:46:30,990 --> 01:46:33,700
he would push me away and then like five
minutes for,

2401
01:46:33,740 --> 01:46:34,540
I'd have to leave.

2402
01:46:34,540 --> 01:46:37,240
I'd say I have to leave and he would 
start crying and freaking out,

2403
01:46:37,241 --> 01:46:37,750
please.
No,

2404
01:46:37,751 --> 01:46:41,320
just say help me with my homework.
And so finally I'd be like,

2405
01:46:41,321 --> 01:46:42,250
all right,
I'm going to help you,

2406
01:46:42,251 --> 01:46:44,890
but if you don't right now get to work.
I'm leaving.

2407
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:47,470
And so then he would be an angel and do 
his homework.

2408
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:50,760
And then week two was exactly same and 
three and four and five,

2409
01:46:51,070 --> 01:46:52,650
I thought this fucking kid is playing 
me.

2410
01:46:52,890 --> 01:46:57,420
Like he's like trolling me in real life.
And at week six they tell you,

2411
01:46:57,421 --> 01:47:02,421
hey,
warn them that you're only coming two 

2412
01:47:02,421 --> 01:47:02,421
more weeks so that they're not 
surprised.

2413
01:47:02,421 --> 01:47:02,421
Cool.
Week six,

2414
01:47:02,421 --> 01:47:02,421
I tell them,
hey,

2415
01:47:02,421 --> 01:47:07,161
just so you know,
I'm only coming two more times and he 

2416
01:47:07,161 --> 01:47:07,161
goes,
nuclear freaks the fuck out.

2417
01:47:07,161 --> 01:47:10,020
Like it was so shocking.
Like I didn't have experience with kids.

2418
01:47:10,021 --> 01:47:14,010
So he's flipping out and this was 
already a kid with behavioral problems.

2419
01:47:14,070 --> 01:47:15,840
So I was just like,
the fuck is going on.

2420
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:18,300
And finally,
slowly,

2421
01:47:18,301 --> 01:47:19,920
all too slowly I realized,
okay,

2422
01:47:19,921 --> 01:47:24,921
wait,
is this because I just told you I'm 

2423
01:47:24,921 --> 01:47:24,921
leaving?
And he's like,

2424
01:47:24,921 --> 01:47:24,921
yes.
And I said,

2425
01:47:24,921 --> 01:47:28,350
look,
largely just to calm him down as long as

2426
01:47:28,351 --> 01:47:31,470
I live in Los Angeles,
I will help you do your homework,

2427
01:47:31,890 --> 01:47:34,110
but you have to do it the second I get 
here,

2428
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:36,180
deal.
And he said deal.

2429
01:47:36,270 --> 01:47:41,270
So that turns into an eight year 
relationship where it became way more 

2430
01:47:41,270 --> 01:47:45,381
than helping him with his homework.
I started taking him to movies and 

2431
01:47:45,381 --> 01:47:45,810
trying to show them just a different 
side of life.

2432
01:47:45,811 --> 01:47:48,820
And um,
took him on the saint called Troy camp.

2433
01:47:48,821 --> 01:47:52,800
So we got to see the mountains for the 
first time and just all like really,

2434
01:47:52,830 --> 01:47:56,630
really getting involved in his life.
And then when his,

2435
01:47:56,850 --> 01:48:01,850
it finally came out that his stepmother 
or his adoptive mother was beating him 

2436
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:05,700
from what I heard,
she was chasing him down the street with

2437
01:48:05,701 --> 01:48:10,701
a baseball bat and I just like,
I literally couldn't believe that was 

2438
01:48:10,701 --> 01:48:10,701
real.

2439
01:48:10,701 --> 01:48:14,030
And so they took them away immediately 
and I was the first phone call and his 

2440
01:48:15,031 --> 01:48:18,840
lawyer called me and said he has asked 
that you be the ward of the court or the

2441
01:48:18,841 --> 01:48:20,850
Guardian to help them through the court 
system.

2442
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:24,480
And so I helped them do that and help 
them get into foster care.

2443
01:48:24,481 --> 01:48:27,630
And,
and I'm just looking at him going,

2444
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:32,750
I know where this ends up,
like I know where this ends up and it 

2445
01:48:32,750 --> 01:48:33,900
isn't good.
And so that was the seed,

2446
01:48:33,901 --> 01:48:38,901
right?
I didn't think that I'm going to 

2447
01:48:38,901 --> 01:48:38,901
dedicate my life to helping people like 
this wasn't that,

2448
01:48:38,901 --> 01:48:40,020
but it planted a seed and it really 
fucked with me.

2449
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:43,590
And I stayed involved with him in foster
care for a couple of years.

2450
01:48:43,591 --> 01:48:45,870
But then they just moved them so far 
away that it was.

2451
01:48:45,871 --> 01:48:48,270
I was broke at the time.
It just was too far away.

2452
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:53,720
So.
But that stayed with me and then when I 

2453
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:53,720
started,
um,

2454
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:56,580
at quest and we were helping all these 
kids are working with all these kids and

2455
01:48:56,581 --> 01:49:00,000
I saw how extraordinary they weren't,
which by the way drug dealers,

2456
01:49:00,150 --> 01:49:05,150
some of them are amazing entrepreneurs.
And so it became this notion of my,

2457
01:49:05,610 --> 01:49:06,420
it's unreal,
dude.

2458
01:49:06,421 --> 01:49:08,130
I'll tell you some stories sometimes.
Sure.

2459
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:10,230
Absolutely fucking crazy.
And I thought,

2460
01:49:10,231 --> 01:49:12,000
Jesus,
you're a better entrepreneur than I am.

2461
01:49:12,001 --> 01:49:17,001
Like they're telling me how they watch 
like the cop cars and when they change 

2462
01:49:17,001 --> 01:49:18,270
shifts and how they know that they're 
being identified by their cars.

2463
01:49:18,271 --> 01:49:21,210
And so they changed cars all the time as
crazy.

2464
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:22,620
And so I'm like,
Jesus,

2465
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:27,800
it gave me this concept that I called 
mining for astronauts and I'm like in 

2466
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:27,900
here,
in here,

2467
01:49:27,901 --> 01:49:32,901
somewhere in here being the ghetto are 
some of the most amazing minds I've ever

2468
01:49:33,331 --> 01:49:33,990
come across.

2469
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:36,270
And these guys could be anything.
It can be fucking astronauts,

2470
01:49:36,271 --> 01:49:37,710
right?
Like whatever they wanted,

2471
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:43,070
but they don't believe they can.
And when I would interview them it was 

2472
01:49:43,070 --> 01:49:43,590
nuts.
So imagine you're interviewing.

2473
01:49:43,591 --> 01:49:48,591
And I came up with just like a fast 
weighted where I didn't have to think I 

2474
01:49:48,591 --> 01:49:51,891
could ask the same questions and one of 
the questions was a magic genie shows 

2475
01:49:51,891 --> 01:49:51,970
up.
It's going to grant you one wish and one

2476
01:49:51,980 --> 01:49:53,920
which only you can't wish for.
More wishes.

2477
01:49:53,921 --> 01:49:55,770
You can't cure cancer.
Bring anybody from back in the desk.

2478
01:49:55,771 --> 01:50:00,771
I'd be something for yourself.
What do you wish for universally to a 

2479
01:50:00,771 --> 01:50:00,771
person?
They all said a job.

2480
01:50:00,771 --> 01:50:01,570
Okay,
that makes sense.

2481
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:04,360
You think that's what I want to hear.
So you're trying to get a job so you can

2482
01:50:04,361 --> 01:50:06,960
tell him you want a job.
Then when we get past that bullshit,

2483
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,950
and I tell you,
obviously that's not true.

2484
01:50:08,950 --> 01:50:10,930
Like what do you really want?
Like what's the job?

2485
01:50:10,931 --> 01:50:11,980
And to get you money.
Okay.

2486
01:50:12,190 --> 01:50:13,870
Do you want money or is it something 
else?

2487
01:50:13,990 --> 01:50:14,620
No,
it's money.

2488
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:19,680
Awesome man.
It's a magic genie can ask for whatever 

2489
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:19,680
you want.
What do you want?

2490
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:22,860
You know what answer?
Every single one of them gave me 

2491
01:50:22,860 --> 01:50:26,070
$1,000,000.
You can buy a fucking house for a 

2492
01:50:26,070 --> 01:50:26,070
million dollars.
K,

2493
01:50:26,070 --> 01:50:27,940
it was so crazy.
It's a magic genie,

2494
01:50:27,941 --> 01:50:30,190
Joe,
like you can ask for a trillion dollars,

2495
01:50:31,570 --> 01:50:33,100
but their frame of reference is so 
small.

2496
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:38,160
One guy,
this was like the one exception said he 

2497
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:38,160
wanted an airport.
I found that so weird,

2498
01:50:38,290 --> 01:50:39,550
so I had to push on that one.
I was like,

2499
01:50:39,551 --> 01:50:40,720
why an airport?
He said,

2500
01:50:40,721 --> 01:50:42,550
because business guys come through the 
airport,

2501
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:44,110
and I was like,
okay,

2502
01:50:45,220 --> 01:50:47,200
what good does that do you?
And he said,

2503
01:50:47,201 --> 01:50:48,730
because then they can teach me about 
business.

2504
01:50:49,220 --> 01:50:54,220
Nothing about that for a second.
How fucking many steps removed are you 

2505
01:50:54,220 --> 01:50:55,420
from what you actually want?
But that's like they.

2506
01:50:55,470 --> 01:50:57,970
They don't have you say,
I'm a systematic thinker,

2507
01:50:57,971 --> 01:51:00,400
right?
So I had to learn that.

2508
01:51:00,401 --> 01:51:05,401
That's not where I started.
So I spent thankfully one of the things 

2509
01:51:05,401 --> 01:51:07,150
I'm most grateful for in my life.
I have to learn everything the hard way,

2510
01:51:07,330 --> 01:51:08,830
but because I learned things the hard 
way,

2511
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:12,850
then I can show other people what I did,
where I fell down and how hopefully they

2512
01:51:12,851 --> 01:51:14,050
can avoid some of the mistakes.
Now,

2513
01:51:14,051 --> 01:51:15,610
most people ignore me.
I'm all aware of that,

2514
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:18,970
but their desire to teach people that 
this is what's interesting.

2515
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:21,640
You're not just internalizing this,
this is not just yourself.

2516
01:51:21,970 --> 01:51:24,160
Correct.
And I,

2517
01:51:24,190 --> 01:51:25,390
look,
I'm wired for compassion.

2518
01:51:25,690 --> 01:51:28,700
I really enjoy other people succeeding.
Um,

2519
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:33,900
the,
my favorite example of that is when I 

2520
01:51:33,900 --> 01:51:33,900
was five,
so my sister would have been eight and a

2521
01:51:33,900 --> 01:51:34,420
half.

2522
01:51:35,350 --> 01:51:40,350
I pretended not to see some Easter eggs 
so that she would win the Easter egg 

2523
01:51:40,350 --> 01:51:41,320
hunt because she cared about winning and
I didn't.

2524
01:51:41,830 --> 01:51:45,760
So that's just a natural inclination 
that I have,

2525
01:51:45,761 --> 01:51:47,950
that I've fed into that I've chosen to 
take pride in.

2526
01:51:48,130 --> 01:51:49,580
Um,
and because of that,

2527
01:51:49,581 --> 01:51:51,790
and look,
it would be a way cooler story if I said

2528
01:51:51,791 --> 01:51:56,791
I met this kid rashawn and it changed my
life forever and I knew I had to 

2529
01:51:56,791 --> 01:51:56,791
dedicate myself to helping people.
It didn't.

2530
01:51:56,791 --> 01:51:58,420
I met Rashawn and then spent almost a 
decade chasing money.

2531
01:51:58,900 --> 01:52:00,190
Right?
That's the truth.

2532
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:02,020
So,
but in that process,

2533
01:52:02,021 --> 01:52:07,021
like that way that I felt in those 
moments where I had hoped that he would 

2534
01:52:07,021 --> 01:52:10,861
do something when I met the kids,
that we're working on the production 

2535
01:52:10,861 --> 01:52:10,861
line.
And I could see,

2536
01:52:10,861 --> 01:52:14,791
fuck I am.
One of them literally came to me is 

2537
01:52:14,791 --> 01:52:14,791
absolutely hysterical.

2538
01:52:14,791 --> 01:52:17,110
He's in tears and he,
um,

2539
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:22,560
he was like,
you're like my fa and stopped himself 

2540
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:23,680
and I thought obviously he was about to 
say you like my father,

2541
01:52:23,681 --> 01:52:25,180
but that felt weird for him.
So he stopped and said,

2542
01:52:25,181 --> 01:52:26,770
do you like my older brother?
And he was like,

2543
01:52:26,771 --> 01:52:30,310
I've just never had anybody that 
actually cared about me.

2544
01:52:30,580 --> 01:52:35,580
So now mix that with the fact that I'm 
only interested in scale and maybe I 

2545
01:52:36,311 --> 01:52:41,311
would be.
Does that mean doing touching 10 people 

2546
01:52:41,311 --> 01:52:41,890
and like having 10 people show up at my 
funeral and just be like,

2547
01:52:41,891 --> 01:52:46,891
this motherfucker changed my life.
And because of him like my 18 and all 

2548
01:52:46,891 --> 01:52:50,411
that,
like they're going to have a better 

2549
01:52:50,411 --> 01:52:50,411
life.
That just doesn't do it for me.

2550
01:52:50,411 --> 01:52:53,440
And I'm being honest.
Maybe maybe I am a worse person because 

2551
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:53,440
of this.
I honestly don't care.

2552
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:53,440
It's just true to who I am.

2553
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:55,400
So scale is interesting.
Having.

2554
01:52:55,490 --> 01:53:00,490
I would much rather touch a million 
people and none of them know who I am 

2555
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:06,880
and know that a million people's lives 
are better off than touched 10 and they 

2556
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:06,980
credited.
Ultimately,

2557
01:53:07,430 --> 01:53:09,560
it's just way more interesting to me at 
scale.

2558
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:13,400
Now.
I also believe that a five o one c,

2559
01:53:13,401 --> 01:53:17,870
three nonprofit is like the worst way in
the world to do something.

2560
01:53:17,871 --> 01:53:22,871
If you're trying to do good,
finding a way to do it through commerce 

2561
01:53:22,871 --> 01:53:22,871
where it's a self sustaining economic 
engine.

2562
01:53:22,871 --> 01:53:25,070
That's interesting because the thing 
that like this is so weird to me.

2563
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:27,560
If you have a nonprofit,
you have to go beg,

2564
01:53:27,710 --> 01:53:32,710
literally beg money from people that 
have a for profit company that have 

2565
01:53:32,710 --> 01:53:33,440
figured out how to make money.
They probably have a little bit of guilt

2566
01:53:33,441 --> 01:53:36,650
so they want to give money to you.
It is the weirdest dynamic ever.

2567
01:53:36,860 --> 01:53:41,860
Rather than just building a company that
at its core is trying to do something 

2568
01:53:41,860 --> 01:53:41,900
good and awesome that you can be proud 
of.

2569
01:53:41,930 --> 01:53:43,820
I'm fucking pr.
If I crash and burn,

2570
01:53:43,850 --> 01:53:46,640
I'll still be proud of what I was trying
to accomplish.

2571
01:53:46,641 --> 01:53:51,641
I believe in.
It makes me feel good to want to do 

2572
01:53:51,641 --> 01:53:54,461
amazing shit for people.
I actually believe that this is the way 

2573
01:53:54,461 --> 01:53:58,601
that you give somebody a belief system 
that is antagonistic to acquiring a new 

2574
01:53:58,601 --> 01:54:00,980
belief system because to do it at scale,
they can't want it.

2575
01:54:01,310 --> 01:54:02,290
Right?
The people,

2576
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:04,850
the people that want to change their 
physique,

2577
01:54:04,910 --> 01:54:09,910
do they eat right?
They exercise and they get results and 

2578
01:54:09,910 --> 01:54:14,411
the people that don't and there are 
people that I love very much in my life 

2579
01:54:14,411 --> 01:54:15,800
and I'm going to lose them too early 
because they don't want to eat better.

2580
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:19,160
So the only solution I could think of 
was there was no option.

2581
01:54:19,430 --> 01:54:23,030
Everything is healthy and delicious,
so all the things that you want to eat,

2582
01:54:23,031 --> 01:54:25,970
you can.
And so that was the mission at certainly

2583
01:54:25,971 --> 01:54:27,770
while I was there.
That was the mission of quest.

2584
01:54:27,820 --> 01:54:32,820
We're going to find one of those.
It was like 26 categories that we 

2585
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:33,800
thought got people into trouble and 
we're going to make a healthy version of

2586
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:35,150
each and every one of those 
motherfuckers,

2587
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:38,840
and that was the mission so that there 
would literally be nowhere for people to

2588
01:54:38,841 --> 01:54:43,841
go to eat badly because they could just 
pursue their most base instincts of just

2589
01:54:43,911 --> 01:54:46,250
gluttonous,
give me carbs,

2590
01:54:46,251 --> 01:54:47,150
sugar,
salt,

2591
01:54:47,151 --> 01:54:50,540
I want to all fat and that they'd be 
eating a healthy version,

2592
01:54:50,541 --> 01:54:55,541
but it felt and tasted just like that.
So our first marketing message was stop 

2593
01:54:55,541 --> 01:54:55,900
compromising.
So it.

2594
01:54:56,060 --> 01:55:01,060
That's a long way of saying it's all 
about leveraging people's behavior 

2595
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:01,060
against them to get them to make the 
right changes.

2596
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:03,080
And I believe that the way that we're 
going to do this,

2597
01:55:03,081 --> 01:55:08,081
we live in a unique time where I can go 
and fucking microphones like this and I 

2598
01:55:08,081 --> 01:55:08,180
can explain to people how to build a 
mindset.

2599
01:55:08,181 --> 01:55:13,181
I do this literally.
I put out probably six or seven hours 

2600
01:55:13,181 --> 01:55:14,570
worth of content every fucking week.
Well,

2601
01:55:14,610 --> 01:55:16,110
I'm just telling me,
yeah,

2602
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:21,320
100 percent.
Really the day you're ready to come on 

2603
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:21,320
my show.
Be Raw,

2604
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:22,430
which people have been begging for for 
ever.

2605
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:24,020
What's your show impact theory.

2606
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:31,240
What does that.
So impact theory is me bringing on 

2607
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:34,991
people like you that have had just 
unbelievable success and finding out 

2608
01:55:34,991 --> 01:55:34,991
what are the things that you did to get 
there.

2609
01:55:34,991 --> 01:55:39,910
So my interview style is,
I'll know more about you than your own 

2610
01:55:39,910 --> 01:55:39,910
mother.
You'll show up,

2611
01:55:39,910 --> 01:55:44,351
you'll get a little unnerved because how
the fuck did I figure all this stuff 

2612
01:55:44,351 --> 01:55:47,231
out?
But then we can have a really cool 

2613
01:55:47,231 --> 01:55:47,231
interview because where ever you want to
go,

2614
01:55:47,231 --> 01:55:48,420
I'm going to be able to go.
I'm not a journalist.

2615
01:55:48,421 --> 01:55:50,670
I want you to shine.
Even if you have literally inspired me.

2616
01:55:50,671 --> 01:55:53,880
By the way I told you a little bit about
why when we first started talking.

2617
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:54,990
Um,
I,

2618
01:55:55,380 --> 01:55:58,320
you're the only person that makes me 
sweat from diversity cakes.

2619
01:55:58,350 --> 01:56:00,240
I fucked.
That's like my thing is an interviewer,

2620
01:56:00,241 --> 01:56:01,260
dude.
Like I can go,

2621
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:02,610
I can interview anybody.

2622
01:56:02,610 --> 01:56:07,610
Doesn't matter.
But then I saw your fucking show and I 

2623
01:56:07,610 --> 01:56:09,640
realized I can't interview a porn star.
Um,

2624
01:56:09,690 --> 01:56:11,880
I probably would suck with Hannibal 
buress.

2625
01:56:11,881 --> 01:56:16,881
Somebody who's just fucking funny.
It needs somebody to go back and forth 

2626
01:56:16,881 --> 01:56:19,791
with and I realized,
but fucking Joe can do dominic 

2627
01:56:19,791 --> 01:56:22,851
d'agostino like on one day and then 
immediately turn around and do like porn

2628
01:56:23,431 --> 01:56:28,431
joke anyway,
so would love to bring on people like 

2629
01:56:28,431 --> 01:56:30,240
you come on because what it all started 
back at quest,

2630
01:56:30,630 --> 01:56:35,630
I have this 25 point bullet belief 
system that I wanted everyone in the 

2631
01:56:36,181 --> 01:56:38,640
company to understand.
I used to be an employee.

2632
01:56:38,641 --> 01:56:43,620
I had an employee's mentality and here 
are the 25 things I had to do to my mind

2633
01:56:43,710 --> 01:56:46,500
to become an entrepreneur and generate 
wealth in my life and feel like I was in

2634
01:56:46,501 --> 01:56:48,450
control of my life.
Nobody else control my destiny,

2635
01:56:48,451 --> 01:56:50,060
but me,
here are the 25 things.

2636
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:55,080
I had this unending fear that people are
going to memorize the fucking bullet 

2637
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:56,310
points and they wouldn't live them.
So I wanted to create a show where they.

2638
01:56:56,340 --> 01:57:01,340
Because it's hardest to impact those 
closest to you don't know if you've 

2639
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:01,340
experienced that.
I certainly have.

2640
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:03,790
So would say so.
Yeah.

2641
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:07,920
So those that are closest to you,
why is it hardest?

2642
01:57:10,620 --> 01:57:13,590
I think it's because there's too much 
familiarity.

2643
01:57:13,620 --> 01:57:17,430
My mom looks impact.
Do you mean in a way like inspired them?

2644
01:57:17,431 --> 01:57:18,450
Yeah,
right.

2645
01:57:18,510 --> 01:57:21,600
But not even through your own success.
You don't think that it inspires me.

2646
01:57:21,601 --> 01:57:24,930
Like my mom is finally starting to say 
things like,

2647
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:27,060
tell me a little bit more about 
whatever,

2648
01:57:27,930 --> 01:57:30,440
but uh,
for a little bit.

2649
01:57:30,510 --> 01:57:32,730
But is that impacting her?
She just curious?

2650
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:35,160
Not yet.
She's asking it in the way that like,

2651
01:57:35,161 --> 01:57:40,161
Hey,
I'm actually interested in making that 

2652
01:57:40,161 --> 01:57:41,721
change,
but I'll just speak for myself in my 

2653
01:57:41,721 --> 01:57:41,730
life for whatever inadequacy that I 
have.

2654
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,710
It's been very hard for me to impact 
those closest to me.

2655
01:57:43,711 --> 01:57:48,711
So what I wanted to do at quest was 
bringing in people that were wildly 

2656
01:57:48,871 --> 01:57:53,871
successful and I want unprompted.
I wanted the audience to see.

2657
01:57:54,240 --> 01:57:56,160
You're going to hear them say the same 
thing as I say,

2658
01:57:56,190 --> 01:58:01,190
even though we don't know each other and
time after time after time they heard 

2659
01:58:01,501 --> 01:58:02,130
people going through.

2660
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:04,020
These people have never seen the 25 
bullet points,

2661
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,870
but they would go through like,
I mean maybe it was like six or seven of

2662
01:58:06,871 --> 01:58:08,250
them.
It's not going to be exactly the same,

2663
01:58:08,490 --> 01:58:13,490
but they would touch on so many.
It was fucking freaky and so that really

2664
01:58:14,281 --> 01:58:15,480
started to play into,
okay,

2665
01:58:15,481 --> 01:58:20,481
we're now moving into a different era 
where you can step forward and I think 

2666
01:58:20,481 --> 01:58:22,900
transparency and authenticity are a big 
fucking deal in,

2667
01:58:22,901 --> 01:58:26,040
in companies today.
I think that Gen z is going to demand it

2668
01:58:26,041 --> 01:58:29,010
and I think any company that hides Gen,
Gen z,

2669
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:32,180
Gen z,
a z generation Z.

2670
01:58:32,180 --> 01:58:33,180
Yeah.
Have you not heard that?

2671
01:58:33,270 --> 01:58:34,620
No Man.
Welcome.

2672
01:58:34,621 --> 01:58:38,430
You're going to hear it everywhere now.
So is that the new lending that the kids

2673
01:58:38,431 --> 01:58:40,170
are saying?
New Kids coming up?

2674
01:58:40,171 --> 01:58:42,030
Generation z?
Yeah.

2675
01:58:43,350 --> 01:58:44,260
Oh,
if you type in Gen z,

2676
01:58:44,261 --> 01:58:49,261
you get like a bazillion sure results.
So Gen z ears are known for like they,

2677
01:58:51,011 --> 01:58:56,011
they say that they're the altruistic 
generation so these people are not 

2678
01:58:56,011 --> 01:59:00,571
comfortable with big business and I 
think that they're going to demand a 

2679
01:59:00,571 --> 01:59:04,561
level of transparency into the people 
that are running the company and the 

2680
01:59:04,561 --> 01:59:05,290
people that get that.
Elan Musk,

2681
01:59:07,630 --> 01:59:10,030
Richard Branson,
people that aren't afraid to like really

2682
01:59:10,031 --> 01:59:13,390
step out front.
Then people just resonate with that.

2683
01:59:13,630 --> 01:59:17,500
And so that is why I do all this.
That's why I'm stepping out front.

2684
01:59:17,501 --> 01:59:19,630
That's why I want people to know who I 
am and what I'm doing.

2685
01:59:19,810 --> 01:59:24,810
I need to build a community if we're 
going to pull off this mission 

2686
01:59:24,810 --> 01:59:24,810
impossible,
uh,

2687
01:59:24,810 --> 01:59:24,880
building the studio,
that's all gotta happen.

2688
01:59:24,881 --> 01:59:25,890
So,
um,

2689
01:59:25,990 --> 01:59:30,990
that's why I create all this content.
That's why I bring people on that have 

2690
01:59:30,990 --> 01:59:30,990
inspired me and my goal is just to set 
them up.

2691
01:59:30,990 --> 01:59:34,810
So I want everyone to walk away from my 
show going like off camera,

2692
01:59:34,811 --> 01:59:39,811
behind the scenes.
Like that was the best interview I've 

2693
01:59:39,811 --> 01:59:39,811
ever done.
So,

2694
01:59:39,811 --> 01:59:40,090
um,
yeah,

2695
01:59:40,091 --> 01:59:41,680
that's,
that's like my mission.

2696
01:59:41,681 --> 01:59:44,680
I just want people to see it from all 
these different angles here.

2697
01:59:44,681 --> 01:59:46,870
All these different people say it.
And quite frankly selfishly,

2698
01:59:46,871 --> 01:59:49,170
I want to learn.
And so one,

2699
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:51,700
the biggest,
the thing that probably impacted my life

2700
01:59:51,701 --> 01:59:56,701
the most was when I stopped building my 
ego around being smart and I started 

2701
01:59:56,701 --> 02:00:00,601
building my ego around being a learner 
and being super humble and sitting at 

2702
02:00:00,601 --> 02:00:01,510
people's feet and just wanting to listen
and learn.

2703
02:00:02,380 --> 02:00:04,900
And then immediately put what I learned 
into action.

2704
02:00:04,901 --> 02:00:09,901
So the show is also wildly selfish for 
me and the staff because we get to meet 

2705
02:00:09,901 --> 02:00:12,760
incredible people that have just super 
empowering wisdom.

2706
02:00:13,030 --> 02:00:17,170
And so I believe that the dual track of 
the social content was just on the nose,

2707
02:00:17,171 --> 02:00:17,500
right?

2708
02:00:17,740 --> 02:00:20,320
You would come on the show and you would
just tell us like how you did it.

2709
02:00:20,350 --> 02:00:23,320
You would talk about like how you got 
into stand up comedy.

2710
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:28,340
I got into stand up comedy because I was
a fucking funny guy when everybody else 

2711
02:00:28,340 --> 02:00:28,340
was nervous.
Right?

2712
02:00:28,340 --> 02:00:31,501
But then like it actually has to become 
a craft and you got to do it over and 

2713
02:00:31,501 --> 02:00:32,770
over and over and talking about that 
grind and how you get good over time and

2714
02:00:32,771 --> 02:00:34,960
people are going to trip the fuck out 
and just like go,

2715
02:00:34,961 --> 02:00:37,210
whoa,
maybe that's exactly what I need to do.

2716
02:00:37,211 --> 02:00:38,950
Which is a message I think a lot of 
people need right now,

2717
02:00:38,951 --> 02:00:40,390
which is,
it's a long grind.

2718
02:00:41,110 --> 02:00:43,200
So it's stuff like that.
But that's impacted.

2719
02:00:43,650 --> 02:00:44,730
Tom.
I gotta wrap this up,

2720
02:00:44,870 --> 02:00:46,800
but thank you very much man.
I appreciate it.

2721
02:00:46,801 --> 02:00:49,450
And good luck.
It's a very ambitious project and uh,

2722
02:00:49,540 --> 02:00:51,300
I'm certainly going to be watching.
Awesome,

2723
02:00:51,301 --> 02:00:52,980
man.
Thanks for me for stars quest.

2724
02:00:52,981 --> 02:00:54,660
I really love your bars.
You guys are awesome.

2725
02:00:54,661 --> 02:00:56,490
Thank you.
All right folks.

2726
02:00:56,590 --> 02:00:58,380
See you.
See you on Friday.

2727
02:00:58,650 --> 02:00:58,950
Bye.
