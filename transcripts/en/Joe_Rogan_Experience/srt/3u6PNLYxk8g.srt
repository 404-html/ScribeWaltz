1
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,100
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,380
[inaudible] [inaudible]

3
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,740
I missed the girl,

4
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,320
the girl Joe Rogan experience one.

5
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,540
I miss her.

6
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,890
I'll switch it up next to the next time.

7
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:40,250
Yeah.

8
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:40,850
Third girl.

9
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:41,450
I miss her.

10
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,460
Maybe we'll even throw in
a robot woman or something.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:43,911
That's good.

12
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:44,744
Crazy.

13
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:45,591
Ladies and gentlemen,

14
00:00:45,591 --> 00:00:46,424
welcome.

15
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,253
Excuse me.

16
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,790
I just got back from Australia.

17
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,800
My Body's very taxed.

18
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,540
I don't even know who I am right now.

19
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,550
I'm in a fucking fog.

20
00:00:55,551 --> 00:00:57,740
I was on the other side of
the planet just hours ago.

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,240
I'm here with Duncan Trussell.

22
00:00:59,241 --> 00:00:59,780
These gentlemen,

23
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,030
Duncan Trussell has joined the podcast.

24
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:03,980
That's T.

25
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:03,980

26
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,410

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,010
There you go.

30
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:07,221
No,

31
00:01:07,221 --> 00:01:08,270
there's an e in there too.

32
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:08,720
Oh yeah.

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,960
Don't say double Estelle alone.

34
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,080
Trussell Dunkin.

35
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:15,140
T.

36
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,140
U.

37
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,140
R.

38
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,140
S.

39
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,140
S.

40
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,140
E.

41
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,140
L.

42
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,500
L.

43
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,333
That's what it is.

44
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,051
Um,

45
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:17,330
uh,

46
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,930
he's joined us because he's the fucking
greatest podcast gas in the history of

47
00:01:20,931 --> 00:01:21,160
the unit.

48
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,820
Ah,

49
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,550
come on.

50
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,890
And we've even tone the lights
down because Dunkin's here,

51
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,140
because I took a nap.

52
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,700
I slept an hour on the plane,

53
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,230
flew all the way from Australia.

54
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:31,280
It's 12 and a half hours,

55
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,090
slept an hour and the plane took
a nap for an hour and then boom.

56
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,760
So I'm on momentum right now,

57
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,623
right?

58
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,463
What's that noise?

59
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,610
I'm trying to figure that out.

60
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:41,444
That's weird.

61
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,443
Why is it,

62
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,460
I dunno.

63
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,870
It's all the STDs.

64
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,100
Brian picked up this weekend,

65
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,850
June the into the Wifi signal by the way.

66
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:51,290
Fleshlight rolled up real quick.

67
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,290
If you go to Joe Rogan's website,

68
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:54,530
I,

69
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,680
you can click on the banner and it'll
take you right to the flashlight website.

70
00:01:57,681 --> 00:02:00,110
And if you put in the coupon
code rogue and you'll save,

71
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:00,471
what is it?

72
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:05,150
15% of 15% off discount
masturbation session.

73
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:09,980
Duncan Trussell and I successfully got
roadie and Danielle Stewart to put their

74
00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:14,870
fingers in my really used flashlight
on the drunk cash and smell it.

75
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,330
Daniel Stewart being
Jason teams girlfriend.

76
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,170
You fuck yeah,

77
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,770
you're right.

78
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,610
You're a problem.

79
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,290
He's possessed by his aides
and it's controlling him.

80
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,510
Is that what right around,

81
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,900
it's like some sort of a parasite,

82
00:02:26,901 --> 00:02:27,230
right?

83
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,370
Like that aquatic worm?

84
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:28,671
No.

85
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:32,690
Or that mushroom that like falls on the
ants and the ants going wander into the

86
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:34,210
pool and drowned themselves.

87
00:02:34,211 --> 00:02:34,610
Or,

88
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,391
I don't know about this one.

89
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:38,270
You haven't seen that
are acidic fun fungus.

90
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:41,700
Maybe we're talking about the same thing
I was talking about an aquatic worm

91
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:46,701
that grows into caterpillars bought or
grasshoppers body gets to a certain size

92
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:50,150
and then convinces the
grasshopper to go sweat grass.

93
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:50,670
Arbors kids.

94
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,220
Right.

95
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:51,541
This is a,

96
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:51,951
what is this?

97
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:52,910
Fungus is different,

98
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,110
but I love like what
does that grass hopper.

99
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,870
Thank you.

100
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,200
I'm just not thinking anymore.

101
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,100
What happens is the,

102
00:02:58,101 --> 00:02:59,980
the aquatic rewires his

103
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,480
brain somehow or another,

104
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,823
you know,

105
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,360
it's the weirdest,

106
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:06,580
like how did that work with evolution?

107
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,290
Like has a bunch of
other ones out there too.

108
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,610
I know there's one that makes some,

109
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:10,960
some bugs head glow.

110
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,250
I forget what the bug it is,

111
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:14,980
but it completely zombifies
the bug takes over.

112
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,100
Just lift your leg up so that
way the light's not facing.

113
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:18,410
Yeah.

114
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,800
I think that might be what that
sound kind of distortion is.

115
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,250
Really.

116
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,083
Yeah.

117
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:22,450
Okay.

118
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,710
I mean like does that sound better?

119
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,510
People at home say yes.

120
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,980
People at home on the treadmill.

121
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:28,060
Yes.

122
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,330
Talked to a lot of fucking people in
Australia that listened to the podcast.

123
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:32,200
It was kind of a trip,

124
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:32,771
you know,

125
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:33,550
because uh,

126
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,780
last year when I was there,

127
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,010
I didn't have the podcast.

128
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,903
I didn't do it.

129
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,131
Or if I did do it,

130
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:41,650
it was only like we'd done like a
couple of them and nobody knew about it.

131
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,581
But now,

132
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:43,080
you know,

133
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,320
uh,

134
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:43,810
when,

135
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,920
when we were in Rudy Hill,

136
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,310
I mentioned the podcast and
all these people cheered.

137
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,061
I was like,

138
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:49,390
wow,

139
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,780
like how many of you fucking Pete?

140
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,240
And then I thought to start
thinking about it like,

141
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,510
has there ever been a medium like that
where you can just put something online

142
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:59,710
and someone on the other side of the
continent can be a weekly listener of this

143
00:03:59,711 --> 00:03:59,891
thing?

144
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:00,910
That's fucking crazy.

145
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,111
No,

146
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,970
I don't mean amazing cause
there a lot of people.

147
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,740
Yeah,

148
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,440
it's packed.

149
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,970
And then we did another show on Sunday
night after the UFC Sunday night.

150
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:13,060
The UFC was over at five because
the way the weather it was set up,

151
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:16,300
it was so it could be live on paper
view in America on Saturday night,

152
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,710
which is Sunday,

153
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,600
early afternoon in Australia.

154
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,420
So 7:00 PM here is a,

155
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:22,780
you know,

156
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,940
like th two,

157
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,863
two there,

158
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,890
2:00 PM there.

159
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,071
Oh,

160
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:28,060
so it was live,

161
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:28,980
it wasn't recorded.

162
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,370
It was live,

163
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:30,830
but it was,

164
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,230
we shot it on Sunday.

165
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,630
So then we were there Sunday
night and we were like,

166
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:34,781
well,

167
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:34,901
hey,

168
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:36,400
we're going to be out
of here at five o'clock.

169
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,061
So,

170
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:37,440
uh,

171
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:37,781
the,

172
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:39,250
a woman who runs a local club,

173
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,001
her name is Jules,

174
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:41,590
it's called the laugh garage.

175
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,051
Uh,

176
00:04:42,051 --> 00:04:42,210
we,

177
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:42,581
we said,

178
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:42,761
hey,

179
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:43,141
well let's,

180
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:43,330
uh,

181
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,050
let's fucking,

182
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,670
let's go do a set there.

183
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,550
So we hooked it up and uh,

184
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,420
just on Twitter pack the place.

185
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,160
Yeah.

186
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,120
Just throughout some
Twitter messages said,

187
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:52,380
hey,

188
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,460
crazy doing an impromptu Ninja show.

189
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,200
And then we went down there.

190
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:58,000
It's all these cool
motherfuckers came out.

191
00:04:58,001 --> 00:04:59,980
It was a really fun show.

192
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,150
It's really fun.

193
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,290
It's a small place.

194
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,740
It only seats like 150 people
and it's real tight and intimate.

195
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:07,960
And just the perfect size comedy club.

196
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:08,650
You know what I mean?

197
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,850
He's got the perfect vibes,

198
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,590
got all the Shitty head shots on the wall,

199
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,770
all the exact things that
you want from a great club,

200
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,701
good bar,

201
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:16,391
great owners,

202
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:17,380
people that love the nominee.

203
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,880
So we did that on Sunday night.

204
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:21,580
We had a a show there
was fucking fun as hell.

205
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,230
Awesome.

206
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,180
And that isn't that amazing that you could
do that now you don't have to fucking

207
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:26,320
go on radio stations,

208
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:28,390
put out advertisements in newspapers.

209
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:30,280
You just fucking put
it on your cell phone.

210
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:30,431
Hey,

211
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:32,140
I'm going to be here at this time.

212
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:32,680
Go here.

213
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,490
This is the first time I really did
it like that where I did a show from,

214
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,350
you know,

215
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,450
from a few hours to let's do a
show in a few hours ready go.

216
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,750
And it all did it wireless thrilly
wireless leads from cell phones.

217
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,770
Yeah.

218
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,371
It's incredible.

219
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:48,430
It's the connection that you have with
people now is just off the charts,

220
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,383
you know,

221
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,320
causing some insane shit to
happen in the world right now.

222
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:53,610
Yeah.

223
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,860
The staff in Libya and the
Middle East and Charlie Sheen,

224
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,210
it's,

225
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,043
I blame it,

226
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,573
Charlie Sheen.

227
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,220
I rarely misses Rogan was ecstatic
about the newest Charlie Sheen interview

228
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,200
cause apparently he kept,

229
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,160
comes off crazy on a fucking loon.

230
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,750
I haven't heard any of it.

231
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,160
He did a new one and he goes up,

232
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,600
the only drug I'm on,

233
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:12,434
it's charming.

234
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,780
I need to hear that.

235
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,790
We'll need to those actual words.

236
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,860
Cause on the way over to the airport,

237
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,480
me and Ari were listening to,

238
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:20,910
um,

239
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,271
the,

240
00:06:21,271 --> 00:06:21,930
uh,

241
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,720
the one who when it was
on the Alex Jones show,

242
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,321
which by the way,

243
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:25,670
it got him kicked off that show.

244
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,300
They canceled production of a show for
the rest of the season because that one

245
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:30,650
interview I heard,

246
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:31,401
I just recently,

247
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:32,060
he said he's,

248
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,060
he's not quitting or he's back on it or
something like that because I knew that

249
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,850
there was a while they were going to
have Emilia Esta Vez feel fill in.

250
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:38,571
But then I thought,

251
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:39,380
I just sit on that,

252
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,170
that heard on or read on
TMZ that and now he's like,

253
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:42,381
no,

254
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:43,700
I'm not leaving the shower.

255
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,440
Quitting wasn't his choice.

256
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:46,274
It was them.

257
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:46,730
Uh,

258
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,690
I dunno what you're,

259
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:48,710
where you're getting this from.

260
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,490
They fired it.

261
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:49,881
Why don't you,

262
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:50,720
why don't you look that up?

263
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:54,320
Because what they were saying was that
they were canceling production of the

264
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:58,070
show for the season because of his
erratic behavior and that he needs to seek

265
00:06:58,071 --> 00:06:58,904
help.

266
00:06:59,410 --> 00:06:59,840
He goes,

267
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,320
I'm just tired of pretending that I'm
not freaking winning at every corner at

268
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:03,801
every turn,

269
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:06,620
just delivering the freaking
goods over and over again.

270
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,380
And they asked him about
piss tests and he goes,

271
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:09,620
yeah,

272
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,730
I'll pass the first one.

273
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,900
Second one is in your mouth.

274
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,763
Okay.

275
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,060
It's called winning.

276
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,390
I'm tired of pretending I'm here,

277
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:18,500
I'm here with the goddesses.

278
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,150
I'm trying to pretend that I'm not living
the perfect fricken life and I'm out

279
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,250
there delivering the goods at every turn.

280
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:26,691
He's another.

281
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:27,470
I love him.

282
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,610
I love him too man.

283
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,490
And I love him cause you
got some coconut water.

284
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,280
You got two archetypes going on,

285
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,123
Charlie sheet.

286
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,170
One of them is he just doing what
really powerful guys had been doing for

287
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:40,070
thousands of years.

288
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:42,020
When they have a lot of money,

289
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,880
they try to establish a Harem.

290
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,043
That's like a,

291
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,250
that's like a basic thing that's
been in society for a very long time.

292
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,300
That's all he's doing.

293
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:55,450
He just living like the Western
version of some Roman emperor I miss.

294
00:07:56,261 --> 00:07:56,511
Right.

295
00:07:56,511 --> 00:08:00,650
He was saying that he was like
going to sue and stuff like that.

296
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,880
Meaning I keep,

297
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:02,151
no,

298
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:02,901
he's not quitting.

299
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:03,081
You know?

300
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:03,970
This is not really,

301
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,840
that's not misread or read it at all,

302
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:07,870
but that's what he was
saying that that's what,

303
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,500
that's what he said.

304
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,121
Yeah,

305
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:10,471
they don't,

306
00:08:10,471 --> 00:08:11,720
they don't back down that easy.

307
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:14,450
This is a gunfight right now between
him and the executive producer.

308
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,171
I know how this work.

309
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:15,860
Did you hear him?

310
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,280
The shit he talked about on the executive
producer that talks a lot of shit and

311
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:22,640
he was upset that the guy said something
at the one of the closings of the show.

312
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:23,121
He said,

313
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:24,040
you know that I,

314
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,980
I eat right.

315
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:25,790
I do.

316
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,810
You know I exercise.

317
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:29,780
I get my colon checked twice a
year of Charlie Sheen outlives me,

318
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:30,660
I'm going to be really pissed.

319
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,420
I would think that's funny.

320
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,860
I would take that as a joke.

321
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,790
It was Charlie.

322
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,421
I would be like,

323
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:35,601
you know,

324
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:40,601
I mean he's going out hunter s Thompson
style man in front of the whole world to

325
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:41,720
see.

326
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,410
Yep.

327
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,930
I'm delivering the fricking
goods at every turn.

328
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,003
Okay.

329
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,873
It's called winning.

330
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,180
He's got that long
breath that he does with,

331
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:51,014
it's called winning.

332
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,131
Yeah.

333
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,650
He's delivering the freaking goods.

334
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,350
Then here on papers a lot better
than when you hear it live.

335
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,100
Find a,

336
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,401
the,

337
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:00,234
the interview,

338
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,530
find them the most recent one because
apparently it's just fucking gold and he

339
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:08,010
looks crazy as shit and his eyeballs
are bugging out while he's talking.

340
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:08,941
He,

341
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:09,141
yeah,

342
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:10,620
it only drug on Charlie.

343
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:15,110
She just did a piss test for radar online
and it came up negative like he dealt

344
00:09:15,111 --> 00:09:17,460
with from The Bahamas and pissed
in a cup in front of them.

345
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:18,294
It's supposedly,

346
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,580
I don't think cocaine stays
in your system that long.

347
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,540
That's not that impressive.

348
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,750
They said that it would have,

349
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:23,970
well,

350
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,241
I mean,

351
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:25,220
I'm sure he's gotten it.

352
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,620
There's a trick or something I'm sure
so that it doesn't show well maybe he's

353
00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:28,891
not.

354
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:30,130
Maybe he's just crazy
and you want to hear,

355
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,610
even hunt doing to hear audio from
this morning is was on the today show.

356
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,473
Yes.

357
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,940
Delivering the freaking goods.

358
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,340
I'm going to get out of Charlie
Sheen impressions I'm working on.

359
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:38,971
It sounds decent,

360
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:39,450
right?

361
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:39,631
No,

362
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:40,381
that's really good.

363
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:41,214
It's on its way.

364
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,323
It's on its way.

365
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,010
I'm tired of pretending that I'm not
living the perfect freaking life.

366
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:47,841
The video,

367
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:48,720
it's called winning.

368
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,750
The only drug I'm on is Charlie Sheen.

369
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,070
You guys get out later sniffle
after I'm here with the goddesses.

370
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,450
That one was good.

371
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,283
That was not good.

372
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,700
I need to hear them and then I'll do it.

373
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,060
I,

374
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,540
it's like,

375
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,470
I need to hear people.

376
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:04,981
There's only a few.

377
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:06,120
I'm not a good impressionist.

378
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,400
I'm only good for like Joey Diaz.

379
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:08,940
You know what I'm saying?

380
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,550
Yeah.

381
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,430
So a few people got
sucker that I got nailed.

382
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,570
I know what a goal.

383
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,860
I know what to fucking talk like him.

384
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,030
Like Alex Jones.

385
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:15,990
I can do Alex Jones.

386
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:16,951
Charlie.

387
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:17,221
Okay,

388
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:18,000
Charlie.

389
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,833
Basically,

390
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,350
you're clean and you've been
clean now for two years.

391
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,100
Check.

392
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,290
Tired of pretending I'm not
delivering their freaking goods.

393
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:26,791
Fucking hilarious.

394
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:27,330
Dude,

395
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,520
I need to put it all
together with some material.

396
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,820
Ai Nine one one yes.

397
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,420
Oh yeah,

398
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,140
a truther.

399
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,360
He's gone as far as,

400
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,411
hold on one second.

401
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:40,110
There were a real quick while we get
over this because this is interesting.

402
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,131
He's gone.

403
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:41,970
It's interesting.

404
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:47,210
He's gone as far as to write a fake
question and answer with Obama where he,

405
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,460
it looked like an interview
with Obama when I first read it.

406
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:50,671
I'm like,

407
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:51,990
what the fuck is going on here?

408
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,530
And then it gets to the end and then he
tells you that it's fiction and wouldn't

409
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:59,400
it be amazing if he actually had the
opportunity to sit down with President

410
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:00,960
Obama had talked to them about this.

411
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,560
I'm thinking Charlie Sheen
might be a government agent.

412
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:09,420
This whole thing might just be his
way of being a patriot and really

413
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:10,620
discrediting the nine one.

414
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:14,010
One truth or movement of what he's doing
is he's just banging all these whores

415
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:14,844
for America.

416
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,773
That's what I'm thinking.

417
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,130
And all the coke and all the horrors and
all the erratic behavior is really just

418
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:23,220
to make the nine one one truther
movement look ridiculous.

419
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:24,090
This is what I think,

420
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:24,924
man.

421
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,241
I think that's high,

422
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:28,740
like 99% problem.

423
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,910
Mostly likely.

424
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:30,331
Yeah,

425
00:11:30,331 --> 00:11:31,170
totally.

426
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,780
I'm just trying to pretend that I'm not
leaving the perfect fricken life just

427
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,250
with that,

428
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,840
delivering the goods at every turn.

429
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,570
He's trim drunk,

430
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,890
he's faking the whole thing.

431
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:41,071
Man.

432
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:41,904
He's an agent.

433
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,590
He's working for America.

434
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:43,871
Well,

435
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:47,790
this nine 11 truther movement can really
fuck up the foundation of this country.

436
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,740
Erode confidence in the base.

437
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,530
And so when Charlie Sheen goes out
there on a deep end in Bahamas with a

438
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:54,190
suitcase

439
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,590
full of heroin with
different color socks on,

440
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,311
you know,

441
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,230
I mean Charlie Sheen
is out there doing it.

442
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,331
30 years ago,

443
00:12:00,331 --> 00:12:01,380
the CIA was like,

444
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,400
get me a baby.

445
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,243
As developers,

446
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,490
we're going to just your rain.

447
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:05,090
Hey,

448
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,060
we're going to get them huge.

449
00:12:06,061 --> 00:12:06,681
Just we're going to do it with,

450
00:12:06,681 --> 00:12:07,460
to start him off.

451
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,750
Super legit.

452
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,080
Yeah.

453
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,960
Oliver Stone Movies platoon.

454
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:11,250
Yeah.

455
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,021
Wall Street.

456
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:14,150
He's going to be a
fucking huge successful,

457
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:14,780
mainstream,

458
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,170
active.

459
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,030
Then massive.

460
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,520
Just whores and drugs and,

461
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,320
and then a rebirth on television.

462
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:22,400
And once we get them on television,

463
00:12:22,401 --> 00:12:24,020
then we've hit the final phase.

464
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:24,830
Okay.

465
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,010
Because when he's on television,

466
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:29,390
then he's in the people's homes and he's
little bit humbled because he's not a

467
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:30,350
movie star anymore.

468
00:12:30,351 --> 00:12:30,651
Right.

469
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:30,861
I mean,

470
00:12:30,861 --> 00:12:32,150
now he's a television star.

471
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,140
It's not quite the same.

472
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:33,974
So he's not as,

473
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,550
he's not,

474
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,880
you know,

475
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,890
he's already lost a
little bit of credibility.

476
00:12:36,891 --> 00:12:38,270
Maybe he's already sliding,

477
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:38,601
you know,

478
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:41,750
but then you hear he's making millions
of dollars a week and he's about blowing

479
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:44,630
and doing crazy things while well now
can Charlie Sheen's out of control?

480
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,561
So then you've got to say,

481
00:12:45,561 --> 00:12:45,711
well,

482
00:12:45,711 --> 00:12:46,310
okay,

483
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,860
why is Charlie Sheen into
the nine 11 truth movement?

484
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,730
Why is he doing that?

485
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,190
Because Charlie Sheen
works for the government.

486
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,780
It's a perfect plot.

487
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,840
You really think they would pay him $2
million a week for that Shitbag fucking

488
00:12:56,841 --> 00:12:58,240
show that chose God drunk.

489
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,710
Terrible at show is a goddamn atrocity.

490
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,270
Of course they don't pay
him $2 million a week.

491
00:13:02,271 --> 00:13:06,260
This is just the mainstream news reports
with the CIA tells him to report.

492
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,603
Yeah.

493
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,271
Okay.

494
00:13:08,271 --> 00:13:12,140
I'm in there working for
America at every fricking turn.

495
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,951
I got to tell you,

496
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:13,161
man,

497
00:13:13,161 --> 00:13:14,180
if you watch that show,

498
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:17,200
I can believe it cause that has to be one
of the most miserable shows that there

499
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,440
is again about working at it.

500
00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:20,300
Like I said this about grace under fire.

501
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:23,120
When remember when Brett Butler
had that TV show grace under fire.

502
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,133
Brian,

503
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,700
who the fuck are you doing?

504
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,630
Hey,

505
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,050
you got your whole shit on auto play.

506
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:28,671
Anyway,

507
00:13:28,671 --> 00:13:30,830
when Brett Butler was on that,

508
00:13:30,831 --> 00:13:31,400
um,

509
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,410
show grace under fire and
she started going nutty,

510
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:37,030
like we're throwing fucking glasses of
water and people's faces right screen.

511
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,900
I heard a lot of shit like that
was when I was on hardball,

512
00:13:41,901 --> 00:13:42,711
the first sip Tom.

513
00:13:42,711 --> 00:13:43,400
Then I was on,

514
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,520
it was like even before news
radio when she was going Nutty,

515
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,010
just like screaming at people like she,

516
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:49,461
she,

517
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:49,710
she,

518
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,543
it was infamous.

519
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,620
There's one thing where they,

520
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:52,730
I believe they cancel the show.

521
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,300
This was the infamous statement that
she said in front of like a table read.

522
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,460
If you fuck your wife,

523
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,380
the way you write comedy,

524
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,630
no wonder why you're divorced.

525
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:07,940
She apparently said that like at a table
read in front of network executives and

526
00:14:07,941 --> 00:14:10,460
all these people and
threw something at him.

527
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,080
That's one of the great,

528
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,330
the Great Ah,

529
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,020
getting shows canceled.

530
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,760
Screaming a romance.

531
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,020
I've heard two good ones.

532
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,310
Chris Titus is a good one.

533
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,301
And then this one.

534
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:21,440
But Chris Titus is a nice guy,

535
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:22,550
so I won't say his over there.

536
00:14:22,551 --> 00:14:23,820
You've got to have to ask him about that

537
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,421
man.

538
00:14:24,421 --> 00:14:25,440
You got to look at like,

539
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,303
I think the,

540
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:31,340
if you look at how being an
American celebrity carries with it,

541
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,700
this bizarre psychological danger,

542
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:40,290
because a pretty large percentage of
our celebrities go fucking insane.

543
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:40,701
Well,

544
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:42,020
when you Morgan on something bad,

545
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:43,220
you're f you're miserable.

546
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:43,491
You know,

547
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:44,510
and when you're a good comic,

548
00:14:44,511 --> 00:14:46,220
like Brett Butler is
crazy is that bitch was,

549
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,360
it was a good comic.

550
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,220
She was a real stand up comic.

551
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:50,720
And if you're doing some show that,

552
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:51,140
you know,

553
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:51,973
just not good,

554
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,270
you know,

555
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,170
like she was a bill Hicks.

556
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:54,711
Right.

557
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:54,921
You know,

558
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:57,680
she was in the bill Hicks documentary
about him talking about how great he was.

559
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,131
You know,

560
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,180
it's like she,

561
00:14:59,181 --> 00:14:59,720
she's,

562
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,230
you know,

563
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,250
she was stuck.

564
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,340
She was stuck making a fuck load of
money on something that's absolutely

565
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:06,950
terrible and that's
some soul stealing shit.

566
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,460
Right?

567
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,300
Like Tim Allen,

568
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,621
Tim Allen.

569
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:10,080
Okay.

570
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Was a legit standup comic at one point
in time and literally quit at all for

571
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:15,980
that show.

572
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,581
Did his show,

573
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:17,940
did his tool time show right?

574
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,070
Whatever the fuck it was called.

575
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:19,791
Brian,

576
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:20,624
we got you one right here.

577
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,110
No,

578
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,070
I was going to turn this off.

579
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,003
Why are you gonna do that?

580
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,290
You get here.

581
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,123
Who gives a shit?

582
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,001
It folks,

583
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:26,451
you hear that thing?

584
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:27,340
It's called refrigerator.

585
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,873
Don't go crazy.

586
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,343
Okay.

587
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,740
Problem is we did that before and
then we never plug it back in.

588
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,590
Then it all my food goes bad
and my pot soda gets warm.

589
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:37,640
That's what I put in front of the sun.

590
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,490
If you're feeling really fucking
frisky where I didn't know that.

591
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:42,120
I thought this was ginger grass.

592
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,470
I was ignoring that.

593
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,110
Let's go deep juice.

594
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:48,700
Well,

595
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,533
you hear the interview?

596
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,191
Yes.

597
00:15:50,191 --> 00:15:50,421
What's,

598
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:51,290
here's some Charlie's Shane.

599
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,000
I don't blame Charlie Sheen.

600
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,260
The show he's on sucks.

601
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,730
There's a reason why he's doing drugs.

602
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:56,270
Okay.

603
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:56,950
That's what I have to say.

604
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,540
And I said this about Brett
Butler back in [inaudible] 94

605
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:06,090
call him passionate eight men start
to get the gas to pull any punches.

606
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,060
Here we go to pretend pretending
like a month special tire,

607
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:13,260
pretending like I'm not pitching a total
freaking rock star from Mars and people

608
00:16:13,261 --> 00:16:14,071
can't figure me out.

609
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:14,880
They can't process it.

610
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,930
I don't expect them to,

611
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,400
you can't process me with a normal brain.

612
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,740
The troubled actor.

613
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,500
Also from 2 million to 3 million
an episode if you want to.

614
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:24,334
You want to race.

615
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:24,901
Well,

616
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:25,291
yeah.

617
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:28,670
Look where they put me through when
it comes to any apologies from she'd,

618
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,160
he says,

619
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,260
CVS execs shouldn't hold their breath.

620
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,330
Do you owe CBS and apology?

621
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,320
No,

622
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,320
they owe me a big one publicly
while looking at my feet.

623
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:37,721
But it,

624
00:16:37,721 --> 00:16:39,720
his interview with Good Morning America.

625
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,160
Charlie said he's clean,

626
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,223
sort of.

627
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:42,690
Yeah,

628
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,770
I am on a drug.

629
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:44,850
It's called Charlie Sheen.

630
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,773
Um,

631
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,833
and uh,

632
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,930
it's not available because
if you try it once,

633
00:16:48,931 --> 00:16:49,471
you will die,

634
00:16:49,471 --> 00:16:50,550
your face will melt off.

635
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,610
And you told him a wee boom,

636
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:52,680
you're exploded body,

637
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,690
not so sure that's working for you,

638
00:16:54,691 --> 00:16:55,524
Charlie.

639
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,370
He's amazing.

640
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,700
The most amazing guy ever.

641
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,600
Wait a minute.

642
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,840
Pause back that up to the beginning of
the interview and let's go over this

643
00:17:02,841 --> 00:17:03,171
again,

644
00:17:03,171 --> 00:17:03,660
shall we?

645
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:03,980
Yeah.

646
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,390
As Duncan trussell's professional
stand up comedian and I break down the

647
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:12,050
brilliant stat is the man Charlie Sheen.

648
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,480
Tired of pretending that I'm not special.

649
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,350
Let's hear that again.

650
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,860
Yes to morning TV.

651
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,041
Oh,

652
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:20,880
starting with the today show
and he didn't pull any punches.

653
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,740
Tara pretending like I'm not special.

654
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,550
Tired of pretending like I'm not pitching
a total freaking rock star from Mars

655
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:26,881
cards.

656
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:27,714
Please pause.

657
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,130
Turn pretending I'm not special.

658
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,210
Did he say Bichon?

659
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,220
Bichon a total rock star from Mars.

660
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,650
I need to listen to that a
bunch of times and get it.

661
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:35,484
Get it down.

662
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,220
Try to pretend it.

663
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,930
Not much special.

664
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,171
Okay.

665
00:17:37,171 --> 00:17:38,610
Let's for a second though.

666
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,000
And,

667
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,900
and by the way,

668
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,440
I,

669
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,610
I kind of feel vial about getting there.

670
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,810
The way everyone gets sick.

671
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,860
Did this shit cause like it's just
gross when the locusts shut the fuck up.

672
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,231
Listen,

673
00:17:49,231 --> 00:17:49,921
this is awesome.

674
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:50,190
This

675
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,360
a hundred percent pure,

676
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,230
unadulterated.

677
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,670
There's no need to make excuses.

678
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,550
This is one of the greatest
occurrences in modern pop culture.

679
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,850
You got to fucking guy who makes
$2 million a year or a week rather,

680
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:04,540
and he's imploding in front of everybody
with coke and whores and braggadocious.

681
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,360
Okay,

682
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,193
so what,

683
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,680
let's just say,

684
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,680
even though he seems to
think he's not on any drugs,

685
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,781
what drug is,

686
00:18:11,781 --> 00:18:13,380
is that cocaine stuff like cocaine.

687
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:13,970
Fuck,

688
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,110
whatever's look at his
face and seize on cocaine.

689
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:16,430
Man.

690
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,150
He loves starting to look like a skeleton.

691
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,860
He looks completely wired.

692
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:20,790
Give that.

693
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,130
He looks like no hands wired.

694
00:18:22,131 --> 00:18:23,190
He loves math or something.

695
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,300
Or it could be math.

696
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,910
I think that's just what I think meth.

697
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,401
Meth.

698
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:27,300
Like how's a coke?

699
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,050
Yeah.

700
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:28,530
Yeah.

701
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:28,791
Well,

702
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:29,071
if they,

703
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:29,391
if he,

704
00:18:29,391 --> 00:18:30,150
if he paused,

705
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,550
if he tested negative for radar online,

706
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,160
I don't think you need
more than three days clean,

707
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,450
I think three days,

708
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:36,651
and you,

709
00:18:36,651 --> 00:18:37,560
you'll test negative.

710
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,660
Especially if you'd take
cleansers and drink water.

711
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,770
So that doesn't mean shit.

712
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,440
You know what?

713
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,080
When did he test Monday?

714
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,550
Especially when you're Charlie Sheen,

715
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:44,851
you just go,

716
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:45,300
Hey,

717
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,800
I'm gonna give you $4 million,

718
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,790
make this test right.

719
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:48,031
And I'm like,

720
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:48,540
okay,

721
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,373
no,

722
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,600
that's dumb.

723
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,010
He could be manic depressive,

724
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,500
like he can be mad like that.

725
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,080
That sounds like someone and having
someone having either a drug induced manic

726
00:18:58,081 --> 00:19:02,370
episode or just a manic episode because
their brain's fucked up from all the

727
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:02,761
blow.

728
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:04,010
And it starts there starting a middle of,

729
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:05,940
what's amazing about it
is there's two things.

730
00:19:05,941 --> 00:19:06,181
One,

731
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:10,200
I wish he was a guy who was doing
this that wasn't obviously insane.

732
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:10,771
You know,

733
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:13,560
it would be so cool if he
was just really having fun,

734
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,161
you know?

735
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:14,850
And,

736
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:18,510
but it's the way he's doing it that he
doesn't realize how that's going to come

737
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:19,150
off.

738
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:19,560
It was like,

739
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,940
I'm trying to pretend
that I'm not special.

740
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:25,050
I'm got to pretend and I'm not delivering
the fricking goods or rock star from

741
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:26,010
Mars,

742
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:26,251
you know,

743
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:26,821
like Whoa,

744
00:19:26,821 --> 00:19:27,750
what are you talking about?

745
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:28,550
Cause you're a,

746
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,350
because you're good at pretending like,

747
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:31,290
what the fuck are you saying?

748
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,800
Like you should be weirded out by
the fact that you have any success.

749
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,690
Anybody that's a performer that's not
weirded out by the fact that how the fuck

750
00:19:39,691 --> 00:19:40,920
did I get to do this for a living?

751
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:41,401
You know,

752
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:42,360
you think you're special,

753
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,540
that no one who does stand up or
acting or music is truly special.

754
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,550
They're just people that may accomplish
special things and the reason why

755
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:55,290
they're doing it because
they're on a path and they,

756
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,770
they get on it and then they get better
and then they tune into it and they

757
00:19:58,771 --> 00:19:59,340
figured out.

758
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,510
And that might be special,

759
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:03,660
like achieving that level
of proficiency with,

760
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,820
with music or with comedy or with acting,

761
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:07,150
with anything that is kind of special,

762
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,760
but the person that's doing it,

763
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,560
it's just because he kept going,

764
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,371
you know,

765
00:20:11,371 --> 00:20:11,731
it's not,

766
00:20:11,731 --> 00:20:12,121
it's not,

767
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:12,960
you're not special.

768
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,890
The most talented person ever is not
really a special person that the acts that

769
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:18,720
they may achieve by whatever,

770
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,801
for whatever reason,

771
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:23,730
whether it's because they're
missing some sort of a social thing,

772
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:23,940
you know,

773
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,530
like some people don't get nervous
around other people and they can begin to

774
00:20:26,531 --> 00:20:29,310
open themselves up because of whatever
weirdness that happened to them in their

775
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,144
childhood.

776
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:34,200
Or some people just have this unbelievably
exorbitant need for attention that

777
00:20:34,201 --> 00:20:38,750
expresses itself in this really
powerful dramatic performance style.

778
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,970
You know that they can just really do
something that really rocks you and moves

779
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:44,370
you because they need you
to love them that much.

780
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,570
But at the end of the day,

781
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,350
even the most amazing,

782
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:50,680
whenever it's just a fucking person
and anybody like Charlie didn't really

783
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:52,210
starts thinking they are special.

784
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:52,781
I mean,

785
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:54,520
I don't know how much of
them is just bullshit and,

786
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:57,730
or how much of it is just him being on
fucking Xanax or whatever the hell he is

787
00:20:57,731 --> 00:20:58,320
on.

788
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,130
But the,

789
00:20:59,130 --> 00:20:59,630
but the,

790
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,080
when when you start thinking
that you actually are special,

791
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,030
do you think he's just
fucking around also?

792
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:04,600
It could be.

793
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:04,871
I mean,

794
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:06,700
I think about it like it
doesn't look like you though.

795
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,180
People don't care about the
fucking media and what the,

796
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,340
the news tab things and he's probably
just sitting in there getting high

797
00:21:12,341 --> 00:21:14,320
laughing about this whole thing.

798
00:21:14,321 --> 00:21:15,670
Probably don't you think?

799
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,560
I don't think he's taking
any of this shit seriously.

800
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,200
I mean the drugs Charlie's scene,

801
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,380
do you really think he's thinking that?

802
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,730
I think he's sick.

803
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,110
You kidding me?

804
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,220
You don't think there's
something wrong with him?

805
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,330
I think he's just using interviews.

806
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,520
Yeah,

807
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:26,750
no,

808
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,640
it seems a little,

809
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,493
uh,

810
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,700
these interviews are erratic,

811
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:29,950
bro.

812
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:30,191
These are,

813
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:30,441
these are,

814
00:21:30,441 --> 00:21:34,180
these are not interviews by a man who
is calculated and gone out there and

815
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:34,691
decided,

816
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:35,200
you know,

817
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,630
I'm going to act like a wound for a goof.

818
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:37,840
Yeah.

819
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,190
That's not what you got going on here.

820
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,750
Hey Charlie Sheen's
not that good an actor.

821
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,830
Okay.

822
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,970
There's no way this is,

823
00:21:42,971 --> 00:21:43,331
this is,

824
00:21:43,331 --> 00:21:43,781
this is,

825
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:44,591
you got an issue.

826
00:21:44,591 --> 00:21:45,290
Now there's a,

827
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,950
there's an issue with him like back
that up a little bit and let's listen to

828
00:21:47,951 --> 00:21:48,590
that

829
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,423
one more time.

830
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:51,740
Tighter.

831
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,940
Pretending like I'm not pitching a total
freaking rock star from Mars and people

832
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:56,751
can't figure me out.

833
00:21:56,751 --> 00:21:57,550
They can't process.

834
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,640
I don't expect them to,

835
00:21:58,641 --> 00:22:00,080
you can't process me with a normal brain.

836
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,760
The trouble back there.

837
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,300
Can we go and he wants a raise from
2 million to 3 million an episode.

838
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,620
You want to do you want to race?

839
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,371
Well,

840
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:09,761
yeah.

841
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:13,140
Look what they put me through when
it comes to any apologies from she'd,

842
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,860
he says CBS execs shouldn't
hold their breath.

843
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,830
Do you OCBs and apology?

844
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,790
No,

845
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,790
they owe me a big one publicly
while looking at my feet.

846
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,220
But it is interview with
Good Morning America.

847
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,630
Charlie said he's clean.

848
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,613
Sort of.

849
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,020
Yeah.

850
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,220
I'm,

851
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:27,470
I,

852
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,241
I am on a drug.

853
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:29,320
It's called him Charlie Sheen.

854
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,273
Um,

855
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,303
and uh,

856
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,400
it's not available because
if you try it once,

857
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:33,971
you will die.

858
00:22:33,971 --> 00:22:35,020
Your face will melt off.

859
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,100
And you're told him when we boom,

860
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:37,030
you're exploded body.

861
00:22:37,031 --> 00:22:37,864
Yeah.

862
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,090
He's not fucking around.

863
00:22:45,091 --> 00:22:46,170
I think he's just having fun.

864
00:22:46,171 --> 00:22:46,561
I am.

865
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:47,190
I'm sure I've seen,

866
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,150
I like hookers in porn.

867
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,750
I'm just going to make a mockery of
this whole entire fucking bullshit.

868
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,550
Maybe there's a little
bit of that for sure.

869
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:55,770
But there's also the
words he's saying that's,

870
00:22:55,771 --> 00:22:57,210
those are the words of an insane man.

871
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,240
But somebody needs to animate
a guy smoking some Charlie.

872
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:07,461
She is body blowing up and it's coming
up in the leaping over the core.

873
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,360
That's hilarious.

874
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,030
We love when someone's off
the deep end like this,

875
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,740
that love it a society.

876
00:23:13,741 --> 00:23:14,221
We love it.

877
00:23:14,221 --> 00:23:14,880
You know him?

878
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,420
Yeah.

879
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:15,631
No,

880
00:23:15,631 --> 00:23:17,170
this is way better than Lohan.

881
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,271
This is low hand.

882
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:22,240
If she had a brain and she
could talk Lohan around,

883
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:22,820
good.

884
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,311
She didn't.

885
00:23:23,311 --> 00:23:23,941
Good effort.

886
00:23:23,941 --> 00:23:24,131
Dude.

887
00:23:24,131 --> 00:23:26,670
This is a thousand times
better as an archetype,

888
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,800
and this archetype shows up in religion.

889
00:23:28,801 --> 00:23:29,880
It shows up in culture.

890
00:23:29,881 --> 00:23:30,930
Not to take it too deep,

891
00:23:30,931 --> 00:23:35,931
but it's the idea of a god coming to
earth and his followers eating him die and

892
00:23:37,231 --> 00:23:39,000
nicest Jesus.

893
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,110
It happens again and again.

894
00:23:40,111 --> 00:23:42,210
This is a reoccurring thing
and that's what we do.

895
00:23:42,211 --> 00:23:44,040
We get people really famous.

896
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,530
We turn into like,

897
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:46,070
we worship

898
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,400
them,

899
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,690
we call them idols,

900
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,010
and then we fucking kill him.

901
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,900
I got news for him,

902
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:50,330
Bro.

903
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,190
Nobody worships Charlie Sheen.

904
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,400
Hilaire you know there are a few,

905
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,720
there's a few like no,

906
00:23:56,721 --> 00:23:57,590
you get that fuse.

907
00:23:57,591 --> 00:23:59,720
Two and a half men start
fellow fans out there.

908
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:03,410
He's flooded every day
with messages from weird,

909
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:04,460
mediocre people.

910
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,751
Pretend he's not special.

911
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:06,410
Yeah.

912
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,810
That's where it gets to your rockstar.

913
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,860
Especially when you're generating
that much fucking money.

914
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:13,694
It's got to get to here.

915
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,960
He probably was sick of that showed
he's sabotaging himself to get off that

916
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:18,950
fucking show.

917
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,140
I don't know about that dude.

918
00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:22,670
That's what this is going to carry.

919
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:24,590
This is going to carry
on much more than that.

920
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:25,950
There's obviously some sort of a,

921
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,330
a bad relationship between him and the
guy who the executive producer of the

922
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:29,541
show.

923
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:30,890
But that's normal.

924
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,060
I don't know.

925
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,893
I can't remember it.

926
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,280
That's really normal though.

927
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:35,690
That shit happens all the time.

928
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:36,381
I've seen it happen.

929
00:24:36,381 --> 00:24:38,810
There's always a battle of
egos between the talent.

930
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,831
No Way.

931
00:24:39,831 --> 00:24:40,664
Really.

932
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,650
I unplugged that fucking thing.

933
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:43,281
I swear to God.

934
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,780
I don't answer it.

935
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,810
I have to keep those.

936
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,310
I'm calling you from your house.

937
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,393
Uh,

938
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:55,010
Joe Pretty much cock blocked us for
the Charlie Sheen interview though.

939
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,120
It's still get him.

940
00:24:59,180 --> 00:24:59,621
So Doug,

941
00:24:59,621 --> 00:25:00,650
it has your podcasts doing,

942
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,513
doing good.

943
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:01,761
Yeah,

944
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:02,594
it's doing good.

945
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,550
The lavender hour on iTunes.

946
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,393
It's one of my,

947
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,130
I don't listen to that many podcasts,

948
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:11,720
but I listen to yours just because I
fucking love anything you do obviously.

949
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:12,000
Right.

950
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,850
But you and Natasha
works so well together.

951
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,100
And we just had my friend,

952
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:16,431
uh,

953
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:20,630
email on this show and he told me one
of the most horrifying stories I've ever

954
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:21,350
heard in my life.

955
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:24,590
What he almost got raped
while he was on acid.

956
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,750
He tells this story on the podcast,

957
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:27,890
but it's just the most,

958
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,400
uh,

959
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,540
and is the lavender hour.

960
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:30,380
Which episode does it?

961
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:30,921
This one?

962
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:31,870
I haven't put it up yet.

963
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:32,601
I'm going to put it up.

964
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:33,351
It just happened.

965
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:34,070
It's just my friend.

966
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,880
It was my friend who,

967
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,970
this musician in a band called ohm,

968
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,370
which is an awesome fucking
man and the holy science,

969
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,490
but basically just tells the story about
getting in the back of his friend's car

970
00:25:43,491 --> 00:25:44,480
while he's on acid.

971
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,470
He kinda knew this guy didn't know
him that well and his friend's car,

972
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,460
the sides of it had been greased like,

973
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:52,363
oh yeah.

974
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,420
You told him you were
struggling in the bag.

975
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,350
Yeah.

976
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:55,641
Yeah.

977
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:57,170
And so he's just starting to trip.

978
00:25:57,171 --> 00:25:58,250
And in his mind he's like,

979
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,061
okay,

980
00:25:59,061 --> 00:25:59,420
I'm probably,

981
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,650
I'm probably being paranoid.

982
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:05,950
This guy didn't like intentionally
greased this fucking car and the guy pulls

983
00:26:06,021 --> 00:26:06,854
up.

984
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,150
And did this house.

985
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:08,780
Uh,

986
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,171
and he's like,

987
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:13,760
I just got to do a quick drug deal and
he goes into the house and email goes

988
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:14,511
into the house with him.

989
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:15,680
I guess he didn't want to sit in the car.

990
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:16,640
He stuck in the car.

991
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,080
He goes in the fucking house.

992
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,320
This guy takes him into a back
room where there's a dude and full,

993
00:26:23,811 --> 00:26:26,030
a full Michael Jackson costume.

994
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,480
And on the wall is a picture of Janet
Jackson naked with candles around it.

995
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,890
Like a shrine was,

996
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:34,830
yeah,

997
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,290
in Wa and his friend.

998
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:36,591
Sure.

999
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:39,500
This wasn't all pat part of the acid trip
and he was really just sitting on the

1000
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:41,050
couch like watching happened,

1001
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:41,880
two and a half men.

1002
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:46,880
This happened and then like one of the
guys started like dancing next to him

1003
00:26:47,221 --> 00:26:47,521
like,

1004
00:26:47,521 --> 00:26:51,720
but there's no music playing and he's
doing like air dancing and then both the

1005
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:54,990
guys leave for a second and come back
and they're like standing right next to

1006
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:56,040
him air dancing.

1007
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,290
And then the guy press play on a CD
player and started playing with loser by

1008
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,070
back and looking on the wall.

1009
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:06,150
There's all these fucking posters on
the wall of due to having three ways and

1010
00:27:06,151 --> 00:27:06,570
he's like,

1011
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,171
oh look.

1012
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:11,070
Threeway threeway threeway
my friends tripping out.

1013
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:15,330
They fucking play loser by back and
start dancing next to them cause they're

1014
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:16,260
just trying to fuck him.

1015
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,520
And he said he ran from
the house screaming.

1016
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,290
He ran from the house screaming and he
said the guy leaned out the window and

1017
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:23,124
yell to them.

1018
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,380
That doesn't tell you was almost raped.

1019
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,700
It sounds like it was almost fucked.

1020
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,390
Hello?

1021
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:31,720
There's a,

1022
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,710
there's a difference there,

1023
00:27:32,711 --> 00:27:33,130
right?

1024
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:33,461
Yeah,

1025
00:27:33,461 --> 00:27:34,390
that's a good point.

1026
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,380
There's a distinction,

1027
00:27:35,381 --> 00:27:35,750
but it's,

1028
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,180
we got mind raped.

1029
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,480
That shit never happens to me anymore.

1030
00:27:40,481 --> 00:27:41,440
I'm Ben Guide.

1031
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,303
Right.

1032
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,200
What is it ever come close?

1033
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,660
You mean ever kidding?

1034
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,130
Just being that.

1035
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,560
Can you imagine just walking into that
room and seeing somebody dressed up as

1036
00:27:50,561 --> 00:27:51,394
Michael Jackson?

1037
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,170
You gotta be careful when you acid man,

1038
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,130
you leave yourself at the mercy
of the universe and if you're a,

1039
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,250
you're going to go do acid and climbing
someone's car that you don't know that

1040
00:28:00,251 --> 00:28:01,490
good and then go to his house.

1041
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,090
Yeah,

1042
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,970
Europe or go to the UFC.

1043
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,320
Would you or do anything?

1044
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,990
Do you do anything where you were going
to be out there and with a bunch of

1045
00:28:07,991 --> 00:28:08,824
people?

1046
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,130
I want to know what
Charlie's doing right now.

1047
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:11,951
I want to know what you doing.

1048
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:12,091
No,

1049
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:12,161
no,

1050
00:28:12,161 --> 00:28:12,281
no.

1051
00:28:12,281 --> 00:28:13,690
I wonder who's doing what and drug wise,

1052
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:14,591
you know,

1053
00:28:14,591 --> 00:28:16,210
and all these girls are saying cocaine.

1054
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:16,840
I believe it.

1055
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,673
I'm sure it's coke.

1056
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,920
I'm sure she's 100%
obviously an amphetamine.

1057
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,550
It's like maybe Adderall.

1058
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:23,230
Maybe he's taking Adderall on top of it.

1059
00:28:23,231 --> 00:28:25,520
Maybe he's just straight arm speed.

1060
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,920
A lot of people on Adderall,

1061
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,110
but people were on it fits
into design it every day.

1062
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,311
Oh,

1063
00:28:30,311 --> 00:28:30,850
really?

1064
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:31,683
Takes it every day.

1065
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,160
Yeah.

1066
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,910
I learned how to Code in
action script on Adderall.

1067
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,240
Is that good though?

1068
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,690
Actionscript sucks.

1069
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:42,501
No,

1070
00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:43,550
Adderall is a great trick.

1071
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:46,610
It's like scientists like studied
cocaine and they were like,

1072
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,660
they came up with a
wonderful version of it.

1073
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,500
I took half of one recently.

1074
00:28:51,501 --> 00:28:52,400
My first time I ever did it,

1075
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,241
he took half of one.

1076
00:28:53,241 --> 00:28:54,074
It was great.

1077
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,070
Took the second half.

1078
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,950
I felt like I was like too much cocaine.

1079
00:28:57,951 --> 00:28:58,160
Like,

1080
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,431
you know,

1081
00:28:58,431 --> 00:28:59,660
you're going to start doing the mouth.

1082
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,370
You have the drips and stuff.

1083
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,240
It felt like all of that.

1084
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:02,960
It was horrible.

1085
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,321
Yeah.

1086
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:03,551
It's,

1087
00:29:03,551 --> 00:29:06,980
it's a pretty intense drug and
I know people are taking it.

1088
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,210
I guess it gets prescribed for
attention deficit disorder.

1089
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,243
Yeah.

1090
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,151
And it works.

1091
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:13,551
It does.

1092
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:14,480
It focuses you,

1093
00:29:14,481 --> 00:29:16,400
what's the name of that
drugs that make you smarter?

1094
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:17,240
What's that called?

1095
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,440
No tropics.

1096
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,310
Is that what that is?

1097
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,563
Nootropics.

1098
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:21,563
Nootropics.

1099
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,370
Yeah.

1100
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:22,581
Yeah.

1101
00:29:22,581 --> 00:29:23,450
I love that man.

1102
00:29:23,451 --> 00:29:26,510
I love the idea that they're going to
come out with a pill that you're going to

1103
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:28,140
be able to take and get super

1104
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,290
well what they are,

1105
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:33,380
they do have right now they
have supplements that aid
the function of the brain

1106
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:37,700
that help you supposedly help you retain
memories and help blood flow to the

1107
00:29:37,701 --> 00:29:37,941
brain.

1108
00:29:37,941 --> 00:29:38,510
I don't,

1109
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:38,870
you know,

1110
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:39,200
I mean,

1111
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,890
I don't know.

1112
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:40,161
Yeah,

1113
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:40,431
there's,

1114
00:29:40,431 --> 00:29:42,100
there's studies have been done on certain

1115
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,270
substances that they've showed some sort
of a cognitive cognitive advantage in

1116
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:47,050
using them.

1117
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:47,440
Um,

1118
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,801
Chris,

1119
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:48,461
Chris Marcus,

1120
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:48,801
the guy who,

1121
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:49,000
uh,

1122
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,833
from the flashlight,

1123
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,910
him and I are putting
together like a little pack.

1124
00:29:51,911 --> 00:29:52,840
We're going to try it out.

1125
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:56,350
And what we're doing is like putting
together a pack of all the best shit,

1126
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,650
all the stuff that's supposed to be like
really good for your brain and put it

1127
00:29:59,651 --> 00:30:03,310
in a pack so that you don't have to
go buy 20 fucking bottles of things.

1128
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:04,420
It's sort it all out yourself.

1129
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,081
Yeah.

1130
00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:07,690
And so for the lazy
want to be smart people,

1131
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,310
you can just buy these.

1132
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,153
That's awesome.

1133
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,330
Now no one wants to buy a
fleshlight cause they're too smart.

1134
00:30:13,331 --> 00:30:14,170
Quit the fleshlight.

1135
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,270
He quit.

1136
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,103
He left.

1137
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,970
And this is the sandwich by the way.

1138
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:19,540
Happy Birthday.

1139
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:19,871
Oh yeah.

1140
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:20,800
Monday happy birthday.

1141
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,210
Happy Birthday Bitch.

1142
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:22,761
So what?

1143
00:30:22,761 --> 00:30:23,710
We're going to come up with some,

1144
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,490
so we'll find out.

1145
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,320
We're going to try them and
test them out and see what the,

1146
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:26,980
you know,

1147
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,241
it's,

1148
00:30:27,241 --> 00:30:28,360
it's one of those weird things though.

1149
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:29,680
It's like how do you know?

1150
00:30:29,681 --> 00:30:29,921
You know,

1151
00:30:29,921 --> 00:30:34,300
like I take vitamins and the only way I
know that vitamins helped me is when I

1152
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:35,134
don't take them.

1153
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:35,860
If I don't take off,

1154
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,521
I've done that before.

1155
00:30:36,521 --> 00:30:39,250
I get to a couple of weeks off vitamins
and I felt like flat and everything.

1156
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:40,480
I just didn't feel as vibrant.

1157
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,270
And then I started taking the vitamins
again and then within a week I was like,

1158
00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:43,541
Whoa,

1159
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:44,470
I feel that good again.

1160
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:46,020
Like this has gotta be the vitamins.

1161
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:46,863
It must be.

1162
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,041
It makes sense.

1163
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:48,191
I mean,

1164
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:50,380
you're supposed to be eating
vegetables all fucking day.

1165
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:50,740
Yeah.

1166
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:50,951
You know,

1167
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:53,890
you're not supposed to
beat and cheeseburgers and
soda and whatever the fuck

1168
00:30:53,891 --> 00:30:54,724
you're eating.

1169
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,240
Yeah.

1170
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,390
I mean the amount of vitamins that you're
supposed to get as opposed to what you

1171
00:30:58,391 --> 00:30:58,990
do get.

1172
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,790
And when you do give
yourself what you need,

1173
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:01,250
like man,

1174
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,560
it's just everything feels clean.

1175
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:03,490
Like it's working smooth,

1176
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:04,410
sweet.

1177
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:04,840
I don't know.

1178
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,270
We're going to try this
out and if it works,

1179
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:07,601
you know,

1180
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:08,111
if it's a,

1181
00:31:08,111 --> 00:31:08,801
if it becomes,

1182
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:08,980
uh,

1183
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,820
something that's uh,

1184
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,691
that's interesting,

1185
00:31:10,691 --> 00:31:11,524
we'll start selling it.

1186
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,610
Is that something you have to get,

1187
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:13,120
like,

1188
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,361
like,

1189
00:31:13,361 --> 00:31:13,571
I mean,

1190
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:14,321
does he have to have like a,

1191
00:31:14,321 --> 00:31:17,760
some kind of license to do this or is
the question like the supplement thing,

1192
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,180
you could pretty much do
whatever you want to do.

1193
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,841
Well it's not,

1194
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:20,310
uh,

1195
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:20,530
the,

1196
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,330
the thing about it being like a,

1197
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:22,930
you know,

1198
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:26,500
it's not like they're not regulated
like the food and Drug Administration.

1199
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:27,760
It's not FDA regulated.

1200
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,121
You know,

1201
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:30,340
it's like that's one of the
problems with supplements.

1202
00:31:30,341 --> 00:31:32,080
They can say they do a lot of things,

1203
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:32,914
but they don't really do,

1204
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:33,750
you know,

1205
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:33,930
it's,

1206
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,130
it's hard to tell,

1207
00:31:35,131 --> 00:31:35,411
you know,

1208
00:31:35,411 --> 00:31:39,760
it's hard to tell what the fuck
has rear re weird and yeah.

1209
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,930
And then at one point in time they were
going to call them a nutraceuticals and

1210
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:46,150
they were going to have them prescribed,

1211
00:31:46,151 --> 00:31:48,730
it was a big push at the
pharmaceutical companies did,

1212
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,620
I think it was in the 90s to try to take
over the vitamin business when they saw

1213
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:56,050
that all these people were spending
all this money on homeopathic,

1214
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:56,920
you know,

1215
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,590
cures and vitamins and stuff
like that and health things.

1216
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,131
They said,

1217
00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:00,221
well,

1218
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:00,431
hey,

1219
00:32:00,431 --> 00:32:00,641
you know,

1220
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:04,660
we'll just fucking lock that shit down
to like Monsanto was gonna fucking put a

1221
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:08,140
patent on vitamin C and the only way
you get vitamin C is from Monsanto.

1222
00:32:08,141 --> 00:32:08,770
You know,

1223
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,041
I mean,

1224
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:12,760
that's not outside the
realm of possibility with
corporate America the way what

1225
00:32:12,761 --> 00:32:14,410
they've done with food in this country.

1226
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,820
For folks that don't know,

1227
00:32:15,821 --> 00:32:16,031
you know,

1228
00:32:16,031 --> 00:32:17,650
you gotta watch this.

1229
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,190
Some of the documentaries that are
available on Monsanto and see what they've

1230
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:21,580
done,

1231
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,910
they've basically done is
they've genetically modified
foods so that it doesn't,

1232
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,650
it doesn't have the same effect
when you spray pesticides on it,

1233
00:32:28,651 --> 00:32:30,520
it doesn't get killed by the same bugs.

1234
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:34,180
They have a bunch of different things
that they've done to various plants,

1235
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,840
but once they have this
genetically modified seed,

1236
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:40,010
you owe them money.

1237
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:40,581
Okay,

1238
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:41,510
this is how it works.

1239
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,680
You can't just grow plants and then take
the seeds from those plants and grow

1240
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:46,191
new plants.

1241
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:47,540
You're not allowed to do that.

1242
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:48,410
It's illegal.

1243
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:53,240
You have to buy a new set of seeds from
them and you own those seeds just for

1244
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:53,960
that season.

1245
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,830
You buy them,

1246
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:55,040
you know,

1247
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,910
you buy them to use them.

1248
00:32:55,911 --> 00:33:00,140
It's like you lease them and then this
is where you owe the money because their

1249
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:01,250
seeds go in the air,

1250
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,120
you know the cross pollination and they
fucking fly off and land in some other

1251
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:08,960
guy's field and he starts growing
Monsanto genetically modified food,

1252
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,340
and then they come in and they go,

1253
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:10,521
hey,

1254
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,000
you got our fucking corn grown bitch.

1255
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,303
You owe us money.

1256
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,990
And they just take your money made.

1257
00:33:14,991 --> 00:33:15,681
It becomes like a,

1258
00:33:15,681 --> 00:33:18,500
a crazy legal battle with
these poor fucking farmers.

1259
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:18,980
Right.

1260
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,290
You know,

1261
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,250
and with Nikki could say that some
of them might have stole the seeds,

1262
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:22,881
that's possible.

1263
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:23,661
But with a lot of them,

1264
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:25,620
it's been proven that it's
just cross pollination.

1265
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:29,150
And so then it becomes a real trip because
these people might be organic farmers

1266
00:33:29,151 --> 00:33:29,331
too.

1267
00:33:29,331 --> 00:33:32,500
They don't want this mutant freak fucking
genetically modified food grown on

1268
00:33:32,501 --> 00:33:33,334
their soil.

1269
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,990
Monsanto is trying to be,

1270
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,270
they're trying to not
just do that with food,

1271
00:33:38,271 --> 00:33:40,070
but they're trying to do
that with animal food.

1272
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,480
Had tried to do that with pigs.

1273
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,500
Like they're there,

1274
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,240
they're patenting pig parts,

1275
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:44,950
right.

1276
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,700
If they're genetically modifying pigs,

1277
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,020
then they're going to
patent those pig parts.

1278
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:49,160
But the problem is like,

1279
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:52,210
there's all this debate about them doing
that because they're saying you're,

1280
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,570
you're patenting things that have
already existed for like a million years.

1281
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,980
Like that's absolutely ridiculous.

1282
00:33:57,981 --> 00:33:58,850
You can't do that.

1283
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:02,570
You can't just patent fucking
parts of animals and shit.

1284
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,800
Like you're going to make it.

1285
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,990
Can you make an animal that you own,

1286
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,310
that you own the patent to it.

1287
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:10,850
And then like what if you want to commit
genocide on the animal that you own and

1288
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:11,810
you gotta just do that.

1289
00:34:11,811 --> 00:34:14,360
Just shut them all off and you created it.

1290
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:14,991
It's yours.

1291
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:15,830
It's artificial.

1292
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:21,220
So it sounds like the same
company that made robocop

1293
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,230
like they're going to unleash
some terrible thing on the world.

1294
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:27,920
Yeah,

1295
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,251
it's,

1296
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:28,820
it's a,

1297
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,571
it's a weird thing,

1298
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:30,404
man.

1299
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:32,670
They filed in invention there.

1300
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,640
They're filed a patent
for the new invention.

1301
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:35,121
The pig.

1302
00:34:35,121 --> 00:34:36,770
This is an article on Greenpeace.

1303
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:37,970
It's fucking crazy,

1304
00:34:37,971 --> 00:34:38,640
man.

1305
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,590
So it's very weird,

1306
00:34:39,591 --> 00:34:40,424
man.

1307
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,990
They called their invention the pig.

1308
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:42,171
No,

1309
00:34:42,171 --> 00:34:42,741
it's a joke.

1310
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:42,921
I mean,

1311
00:34:42,921 --> 00:34:45,470
that's the joke title of this,

1312
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:46,160
you know?

1313
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:46,581
But they're,

1314
00:34:46,581 --> 00:34:47,720
they're patent plans.

1315
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,291
They,

1316
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:48,441
uh,

1317
00:34:48,441 --> 00:34:49,150
they're out there.

1318
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,580
The world's food supply don't pay.

1319
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,510
They're out to own the
world's food supply man.

1320
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:54,321
And they can,

1321
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:54,890
they can,

1322
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:55,700
you know,

1323
00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:00,140
it's just amazing that it's gotten to
this point where they've let anybody put

1324
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:01,820
any sort of a patent on life.

1325
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,100
I understand that once you
start to alter that life,

1326
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:05,200
then it becomes a real question.

1327
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:05,750
Like,

1328
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,021
well,

1329
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:06,351
you know,

1330
00:35:06,351 --> 00:35:06,681
I mean,

1331
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:06,871
you're,

1332
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:07,520
you're really,

1333
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:07,850
I mean,

1334
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:08,631
in a sense,

1335
00:35:08,631 --> 00:35:09,680
you're sort of playing God,

1336
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:09,951
you're,

1337
00:35:09,951 --> 00:35:11,990
you're genetically modifying the,

1338
00:35:11,991 --> 00:35:12,580
the,

1339
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,170
the structure of a plant to your liking,

1340
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,130
and then you own a patent
on that piece of life.

1341
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:19,671
I mean,

1342
00:35:19,671 --> 00:35:20,504
it's not your path.

1343
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,760
We're allowing people to patent life.

1344
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,980
And if it sounds ridiculous with a pig,

1345
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:25,631
well guess what?

1346
00:35:25,631 --> 00:35:27,530
It's just as ridiculous with
a fucking head of lettuce.

1347
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:27,951
All right?

1348
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:28,850
It's all ridiculous.

1349
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,810
But a patent is,

1350
00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:30,180
you know,

1351
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,400
the thing about it is,

1352
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,710
is the most disturbing thing is the
idea of some corporation just for profit

1353
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:38,460
meddling with the DNA

1354
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,460
of things that haven't been
metaled with for a very long time.

1355
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,570
That's bizarre.

1356
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,270
That's much more bizarre than
the patent because the patent,

1357
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,160
just an imaginary thing anyway.

1358
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:47,741
Yeah.

1359
00:35:47,741 --> 00:35:48,131
Well,

1360
00:35:48,131 --> 00:35:48,401
what's,

1361
00:35:48,401 --> 00:35:52,630
what's really scary about it is the idea
that they can stop other people from

1362
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:53,743
growing it.

1363
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,740
They can stop other people from having it.

1364
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:56,260
I'm,

1365
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:56,710
I'm,

1366
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,460
I'm too nice.

1367
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:57,661
I have,

1368
00:35:57,661 --> 00:35:59,140
must be naive right now because I,

1369
00:35:59,141 --> 00:36:01,300
this shit going on in Egypt and Libya,

1370
00:36:01,301 --> 00:36:03,140
it makes me think that they're,

1371
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,710
the corporate bullshit
like that is just such a,

1372
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:05,980
uh,

1373
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,120
is a pipe dream.

1374
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:07,830
Did they,

1375
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:11,320
they will invoke things like that and
there'll be a period of time where the

1376
00:36:11,321 --> 00:36:12,470
belt gets too tight,

1377
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:14,440
but I just don't think it works.

1378
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,100
Yeah.

1379
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,820
I don't know what's going on in Egypt
and what's going on in Libya and what's

1380
00:36:18,821 --> 00:36:20,170
going on in Iran,

1381
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,670
but I don't think anything really
happens without the CIA being involved.

1382
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,121
Yeah,

1383
00:36:25,121 --> 00:36:25,570
that's,

1384
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:26,530
I agree with that.

1385
00:36:26,531 --> 00:36:28,570
I don't think these things
just start happening.

1386
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,470
I think someone,

1387
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:34,750
some fucking dude who works for America
is over there and he's helping organize

1388
00:36:34,751 --> 00:36:38,320
shit and get people not to take anything
away from the heroic effort that these

1389
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,154
people have done.

1390
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,370
You know,

1391
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,680
especially in Egypt and
when Mubarak is gone,

1392
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,161
you know,

1393
00:36:42,161 --> 00:36:44,560
and in Libya right now they're
getting gunned down the street.

1394
00:36:44,561 --> 00:36:45,161
There's videos.

1395
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,100
I've seen a bunch of them online
of people getting hit by snipers.

1396
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,460
Yeah.

1397
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,660
It's fucking dark shit,

1398
00:36:49,661 --> 00:36:49,871
man.

1399
00:36:49,871 --> 00:36:51,190
They're just blowing dude's heads off.

1400
00:36:51,191 --> 00:36:51,401
Yeah.

1401
00:36:51,401 --> 00:36:52,180
Middle of the streets.

1402
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:52,630
Yeah.

1403
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,130
Not to take anything away from that.

1404
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,031
I mean,

1405
00:36:55,031 --> 00:36:56,830
these people really are
doing something courageous,

1406
00:36:56,831 --> 00:36:59,680
but for sure there's some
influence there for sure.

1407
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,570
Our government's involved in everything.

1408
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:05,670
I think our government does not want
what's happening in the Middle East to be

1409
00:37:05,671 --> 00:37:06,271
happening.

1410
00:37:06,271 --> 00:37:07,590
And really if there are people out there,

1411
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:08,790
if there's some conspiracy,

1412
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,181
no,

1413
00:37:09,181 --> 00:37:10,770
because you've got fucking,

1414
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,953
uh,

1415
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,340
right after it.

1416
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,010
Uh,

1417
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,170
right after everything went down in Egypt,

1418
00:37:16,171 --> 00:37:18,610
they were showing pictures of Mubarak on,

1419
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,270
on mainstream press as though
you're kind of a good guy.

1420
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:21,961
I mean,

1421
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:26,700
it's so cool to watch mainstream news
because it's like they have to spend a few

1422
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,070
days deciding what tone
they're going to take with it.

1423
00:37:29,071 --> 00:37:31,320
And when the Egyptian revolution started,

1424
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:34,380
the United States government didn't
come out and do much at all because they

1425
00:37:34,381 --> 00:37:37,800
were waiting to see if they would be
able to push them down to hold them down.

1426
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:38,551
You know?

1427
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:41,070
And then they kind of came
out in favor of the people,

1428
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:41,791
but they had to you.

1429
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:45,240
But there's pictures of
Obama meeting with him,

1430
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:45,990
uh,

1431
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,790
many presidents meeting with him.

1432
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:48,181
He was,

1433
00:37:48,181 --> 00:37:49,830
I think he was already ours.

1434
00:37:49,831 --> 00:37:51,240
I don't think we want
it to get rid of him.

1435
00:37:51,241 --> 00:37:52,940
I think we liked him
right where he was at.

1436
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:53,741
But you know,

1437
00:37:53,741 --> 00:37:54,670
how do you know though?

1438
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,900
It's all speculation.

1439
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,750
We might might've like run his course
because at one point in time we wanted

1440
00:37:58,751 --> 00:37:59,584
Hussein in there.

1441
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,910
You know who's saying was our boards?

1442
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:02,550
I'll Rumsfeld shaking his hands.

1443
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,393
A famous photo,

1444
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,180
you know,

1445
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,520
he was our guy over there when
they were at war with Iran.

1446
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:06,931
I mean,

1447
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:07,321
unless,

1448
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:08,400
I mean our guy,

1449
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:09,220
listen to me,

1450
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,790
there's no way to like her teeth.

1451
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,560
I wouldn't be surprised if,

1452
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:13,810
uh,

1453
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:14,643
this is some,

1454
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:15,700
I mean I'm,

1455
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,930
I'm such a fucking new
age hippie sometimes like,

1456
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,040
you know,

1457
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,400
2012 coming up and the
acceleration of technology,

1458
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:28,380
what I like to think of this as is the
beginning of people having the ability to

1459
00:38:28,381 --> 00:38:31,890
organize themselves in a way that's
never been possible in human history.

1460
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:35,950
Mixing in with the ability to get
information that you could never get.

1461
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,940
So that motivates people
to revolt against uh,

1462
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,551
liars.

1463
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:40,800
And that's what the Internet is doing.

1464
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,000
Just showing who the
fucking liars are out there.

1465
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:43,741
Yeah,

1466
00:38:43,741 --> 00:38:44,680
I think you're right about that.

1467
00:38:44,681 --> 00:38:45,840
I definitely think that as well.

1468
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,860
I definitely think that,

1469
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:47,160
you know,

1470
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,570
the social media and you know,

1471
00:38:48,571 --> 00:38:52,140
using Facebook and Twitter to get messages
out to where we're going to protest

1472
00:38:52,141 --> 00:38:53,280
and where are we going to
meet and that they can,

1473
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,710
I mean this is one of the first things
they did in Egypt and one of the first

1474
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,210
things they did in Libya is cut off their,

1475
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,190
their supplier of the Internet.

1476
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,430
They cut off their
connection or something.

1477
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,830
But you know,

1478
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:02,520
I mean,

1479
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,060
how might mean don't think that the
CIA's and fucking super savvy about that

1480
00:39:06,061 --> 00:39:06,840
kind of shit too.

1481
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,351
You know what I mean?

1482
00:39:07,351 --> 00:39:08,220
Because of course they are.

1483
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:08,791
I know.

1484
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:09,960
I'm not saying that it's,

1485
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:10,710
this isn't,

1486
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,011
you know,

1487
00:39:11,011 --> 00:39:14,730
it's not possible that it's just
a plain old fashioned revolt.

1488
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,910
I just think that the United
States is so clever about,

1489
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:18,660
you know,

1490
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,990
the foreign policy and how they interfere
with other countries that there,

1491
00:39:21,991 --> 00:39:24,450
they don't ever allow
anything to really slip by.

1492
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:24,991
You know,

1493
00:39:24,991 --> 00:39:28,080
when this guy got arrested in Pakistan
for shooting down some people who tried

1494
00:39:28,081 --> 00:39:31,650
to rob them and then it turned out the
guy was a CIA operative that was embedded

1495
00:39:31,651 --> 00:39:32,630
into the system over there.

1496
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:33,120
You know,

1497
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,200
when you find out stuff like that,

1498
00:39:34,201 --> 00:39:34,441
it's like,

1499
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:34,681
wow,

1500
00:39:34,681 --> 00:39:36,090
how many of these guys are there?

1501
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:36,570
You know,

1502
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:37,290
how many,

1503
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:37,620
you know,

1504
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,480
I have a buddy and I've
talked about it before.

1505
00:39:39,481 --> 00:39:40,320
He doesn't like talking about it,

1506
00:39:40,321 --> 00:39:42,000
but his dad was in the CIA.

1507
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,280
He didn't find out until he
was fucking 30 years old.

1508
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:44,730
Wow.

1509
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:45,221
He didn't know.

1510
00:39:45,221 --> 00:39:47,130
He thought he thought
his dad was a banker.

1511
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,300
Oh Wow.

1512
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,320
That's cool man.

1513
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,280
It's a trip.

1514
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:50,670
You know,

1515
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,390
it's interesting.

1516
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:51,661
You know,

1517
00:39:51,661 --> 00:39:52,530
it's very interesting.

1518
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:56,320
I think what happens is
something like this goes down,

1519
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,190
they have like,

1520
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,900
they had statistics,

1521
00:39:58,901 --> 00:40:00,880
they probably had think tanks where like,

1522
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:01,420
here's a,

1523
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,210
there's a possibility that this is
going to happen in the Middle East.

1524
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,040
And when it happens,

1525
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,060
here's our plan.

1526
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,200
We know this guy out there,

1527
00:40:08,201 --> 00:40:09,011
this guy out there,

1528
00:40:09,011 --> 00:40:09,791
this guy out there,

1529
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:11,320
then let's move in to try to,

1530
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:11,981
to,

1531
00:40:11,981 --> 00:40:12,814
um,

1532
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,150
uh,

1533
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,010
make the situation to our advantage.

1534
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:15,890
But I,

1535
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:16,170
I,

1536
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:16,410
I'm,

1537
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:16,720
uh,

1538
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,670
I'm skeptical for no reason other than
it just seems like this doesn't work with

1539
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:25,400
my understanding of the
way a empire likes to run.

1540
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,420
Uh,

1541
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,760
it's my opinion that this is,

1542
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:32,761
that the people doing this more
than it is a CIA instigated thing.

1543
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,770
And I think even if it was
a CIA instigated thing,

1544
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:37,930
it might have turned into
something they didn't expect.

1545
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:39,040
Cause really the,

1546
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,710
the one thing we don't
want over there is for a,

1547
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:42,811
what's it called?

1548
00:40:42,811 --> 00:40:44,920
At Hedge Hedge Hedge Lemoni.

1549
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,960
We don't want the fucking uh,

1550
00:40:47,961 --> 00:40:49,380
it to become a theocracy.

1551
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:49,920
Right.

1552
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,461
You know what I mean?

1553
00:40:50,461 --> 00:40:53,270
We don't want that because this is
another thing that was concerned.

1554
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:53,880
I'm sorry,

1555
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,060
but this Muslim Brotherhood thing
that we keep hearing about lately,

1556
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:57,900
you know.

1557
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,260
Yeah.

1558
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:58,830
Who are they?

1559
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,760
What the fuck is this?

1560
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,240
Where is it?

1561
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,390
How is this Jess coming up?

1562
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,430
Cause this is like an
episode of lost where they,

1563
00:41:05,431 --> 00:41:07,770
there is the last season and you know,

1564
00:41:07,771 --> 00:41:10,580
they have to introduce some new
character and this new magic guide.

1565
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:14,130
That's one of the reasons why I fucking
gave up on lost the last season.

1566
00:41:14,131 --> 00:41:17,130
We started bringing people back from the
dead and Jack started walking through

1567
00:41:17,131 --> 00:41:17,840
his lines.

1568
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,150
Yeah.

1569
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,391
That,

1570
00:41:18,391 --> 00:41:19,020
fuck,

1571
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,370
I'll never watch anything with that guy.

1572
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,620
You see the end and figuring
out how it all makes sense.

1573
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,180
No it doesn't because I don't,

1574
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,073
they don't get me.

1575
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,771
You don't get me.

1576
00:41:25,771 --> 00:41:27,120
You ruined me Jack.

1577
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:31,020
You'll fuck I'm fucking goofball
walking through all your scenes.

1578
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,980
He just was mad that he wasn't
like a cool guy anymore.

1579
00:41:33,981 --> 00:41:35,270
Like he wasn't the beginning of the show.

1580
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,141
The beginning of the show.

1581
00:41:36,141 --> 00:41:40,910
Jack was the bomb diggity he had great
characters and amazing guy who's out

1582
00:41:40,911 --> 00:41:41,250
there doing,

1583
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,630
he was a fucking hero and it's somewhere
along the line I bet that act or piss

1584
00:41:44,631 --> 00:41:48,340
people off by being a content and they
slowly started making him a continent and

1585
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,090
is you know,

1586
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:53,330
became a junkie and a failure and a zero
like his character like went into the

1587
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:57,830
shitter hard in a way that you would
never have expected from like the first

1588
00:41:57,831 --> 00:41:58,550
season.

1589
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:02,210
Like what the hell did that guy do
behind the scene there with one of the

1590
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:04,020
writers and broke up with her.

1591
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,850
I think they just,

1592
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,240
they get to know your real personality
after awhile and I just started

1593
00:42:11,241 --> 00:42:12,001
incorporating your,

1594
00:42:12,001 --> 00:42:13,640
your douche penis into the script,

1595
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,913
you know,

1596
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,810
cause I know they do that on,

1597
00:42:16,811 --> 00:42:18,020
on shows all the time.

1598
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:21,500
They do that on shows all the time and
people can play apparent like that girl,

1599
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,131
what's her name?

1600
00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:25,190
Catherine Heagle that's in like all those
romantic movies that make you want to

1601
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:29,450
fucking hurl the movie with Josh Duhamel
when they have to have a kid together

1602
00:42:29,451 --> 00:42:30,284
and they're not really,

1603
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:32,540
really the real parents
and they fell in love.

1604
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,360
Well she was on that show.

1605
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:40,380
'Em The fuck is that stupid show with
the doctor McDreamy whatever the fuck,

1606
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,340
what is it?

1607
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,020
You're not Grey's anatomy and uh,

1608
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,560
apparently they just fucking,

1609
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:49,830
they started giving her like really shitty
parts and not writing or into mosques

1610
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,020
because she started getting an attitude.

1611
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,180
It did happen.

1612
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:52,411
Happens.

1613
00:42:52,411 --> 00:42:52,781
It happens.

1614
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:54,320
This is Charlie Sheen situation,

1615
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:54,770
man.

1616
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:55,700
Look what they've done with him.

1617
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:57,710
They cut off the last four seasons,

1618
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,180
the last four episodes of the season,

1619
00:42:59,181 --> 00:43:00,014
they stopped filming.

1620
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,370
That's going to cost Charlie $8 million
and it's going to cost them a fuck load

1621
00:43:04,371 --> 00:43:04,821
of money to,

1622
00:43:04,821 --> 00:43:07,660
because they've already sold the
advertising for those to Verde,

1623
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:11,300
like committed to selling them for
syndication as a syndicated show.

1624
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:11,790
Yeah,

1625
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:12,090
that's a,

1626
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,220
that's a big loss for them.

1627
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,580
They're hoping that trolley pulls it
together and then by the time it goes

1628
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:17,361
around next year,

1629
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,410
they can add four to next
year and then you know,

1630
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:20,540
and make up for what they owe.

1631
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:23,540
So this is basically like
for the corporations,

1632
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:24,620
this is the same thing.

1633
00:43:24,621 --> 00:43:29,450
It's when like a Roman emperor emperor
had a favorite gladiator and the people

1634
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:30,380
loved the gladiator,

1635
00:43:30,381 --> 00:43:32,840
but he got a big hat and
started going a little crazy.

1636
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:33,841
That's what they say.

1637
00:43:33,841 --> 00:43:34,970
Is there a little puppet?

1638
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,370
It's kind of like miss
firing a little bit.

1639
00:43:37,371 --> 00:43:37,551
Well,

1640
00:43:37,551 --> 00:43:41,390
you can't have a successful show
without someone being a star.

1641
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,290
They become a star.

1642
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:44,900
Whether they were a star at
first like Charlie was already,

1643
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:49,190
or whether they become one like Brett
Butler or you know Chris Titus or anybody

1644
00:43:49,191 --> 00:43:49,670
else.

1645
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:50,121
When you,

1646
00:43:50,121 --> 00:43:51,440
when you get on a show,

1647
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:52,701
that's what happens.

1648
00:43:52,701 --> 00:43:54,890
You get a successful show and
all of a sudden this one person,

1649
00:43:54,891 --> 00:43:58,070
I mean you really do fucking need that
one person more than everyone else.

1650
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,260
I mean it's really that a mind fuck.

1651
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:01,340
That's a mind fuck.

1652
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,760
Especially for actors because
for a giant chunk of their life,

1653
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,200
not necessarily what Charlie Sheen,

1654
00:44:06,201 --> 00:44:07,760
he was pretty much instantly successful.

1655
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,290
But for most actors,

1656
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:12,950
it's a long series of failures and
disappointments and rejections.

1657
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,400
And then finally you make
it with something and you
have a fucking chip on your

1658
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:18,770
shoulder for all those
people that caused you pain.

1659
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:22,550
I can't tell you how many conversations
I've had famous dudes that we'll talk

1660
00:44:22,551 --> 00:44:26,930
about still to this day about horrible
fucking casting sessions that they had

1661
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:27,680
horrible,

1662
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:27,891
you know,

1663
00:44:27,891 --> 00:44:29,870
auditions where it went
wrong and you know,

1664
00:44:29,871 --> 00:44:31,130
all the scuffling around,

1665
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,080
all the humiliating auditions
that they had to go on and on.

1666
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:34,801
It's like fucking,

1667
00:44:34,801 --> 00:44:35,070
you know,

1668
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:35,440
people,

1669
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,320
they get in there and they,

1670
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:37,711
they,

1671
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:38,190
you know,

1672
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:42,090
they become famous and they just want to
get back at all those people that hurt

1673
00:44:42,091 --> 00:44:42,870
them all that time.

1674
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:43,300
Yeah.

1675
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:46,380
It's like they needed all that absorb
exorbitant amount of attention.

1676
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:47,760
They needed to be fucking special.

1677
00:44:47,761 --> 00:44:48,391
And everyone was saying,

1678
00:44:48,391 --> 00:44:48,661
no,

1679
00:44:48,661 --> 00:44:49,290
you're not.

1680
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:49,501
No,

1681
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:50,130
you're not.

1682
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:50,341
No,

1683
00:44:50,341 --> 00:44:50,940
you're not.

1684
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:51,271
No,

1685
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:51,841
you're normal.

1686
00:44:51,841 --> 00:44:52,111
No,

1687
00:44:52,111 --> 00:44:52,891
you're not good enough.

1688
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:53,161
No,

1689
00:44:53,161 --> 00:44:53,470
fuck.

1690
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:53,790
Yeah.

1691
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:54,870
And then finally become famous.

1692
00:44:54,871 --> 00:44:55,110
You know,

1693
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:55,943
judge saw.

1694
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,053
Yeah.

1695
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:57,900
Yeah.

1696
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,380
It's like this bounce back the other
direction is so enormous because of how

1697
00:45:01,381 --> 00:45:02,214
much is pushing,

1698
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,020
pushing them down in the beginning.

1699
00:45:04,021 --> 00:45:04,410
You know,

1700
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,170
how they feel.

1701
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:05,441
Well,

1702
00:45:05,441 --> 00:45:05,681
it's,

1703
00:45:05,681 --> 00:45:05,981
you know,

1704
00:45:05,981 --> 00:45:06,370
man,

1705
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:11,370
when you run into an actor or a
comedian or anybody who seems proud of

1706
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:14,044
themselves,

1707
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,190
it's automatically so
disappointing because it's like,

1708
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:18,850
oh,

1709
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:21,300
you think you're right.

1710
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:23,200
The thing that's making this,

1711
00:45:23,201 --> 00:45:24,370
you think your,

1712
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:27,220
you really think you are responsible you.

1713
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:28,570
And that's the most,

1714
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:32,170
it's like a radio thinking that
it's awesome for playing a song

1715
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,810
or a volcano thinking it's awesome for
the lava that comes spraying out of it.

1716
00:45:35,811 --> 00:45:36,560
It's like,

1717
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:36,921
yeah,

1718
00:45:36,921 --> 00:45:37,910
you're kind of like,

1719
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:38,451
you're,

1720
00:45:38,451 --> 00:45:39,500
you're a conduit.

1721
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:40,490
You're a conduit.

1722
00:45:40,491 --> 00:45:42,240
You're not the fucking thing man.

1723
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:42,900
Whenever

1724
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,720
that sounds ridiculous to people
that don't create things though.

1725
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,520
And we talked to a person
who is not creative.

1726
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:49,350
It doesn't write a lot
or to perform a lot.

1727
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,510
They really don't have any
idea what you're talking about.

1728
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:51,961
You know?

1729
00:45:51,961 --> 00:45:54,270
And most people out there are not,

1730
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:54,541
you know,

1731
00:45:54,541 --> 00:45:56,100
they don't make the living or living,

1732
00:45:56,101 --> 00:45:56,840
being creative.

1733
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,120
They,

1734
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,200
a lot of people never achieve
that zen state where whatever you,

1735
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,370
you've gotten good at it.

1736
00:46:02,371 --> 00:46:04,290
Whether it's art or music or you know,

1737
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:05,440
the immediate even dance,

1738
00:46:05,441 --> 00:46:06,031
they say that.

1739
00:46:06,031 --> 00:46:09,870
And in martial arts I say that it's
anything that you get really good at,

1740
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:13,050
you get into this sort of
zone where it's no longer you.

1741
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,990
It's like you've practiced it enough
to the point where you can become

1742
00:46:15,991 --> 00:46:18,030
subconscious and then once you do it,

1743
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,740
it's like you're just tuning in,

1744
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:23,070
you're tuning into whatever the fuck it
is out there that makes things awesome

1745
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:25,410
and people don't understand
that they don't do it.

1746
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:27,270
It sounds like such an ether thorough,

1747
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,830
ridiculous notion,

1748
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:30,930
but it's so widely accepted.

1749
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:31,441
You know,

1750
00:46:31,441 --> 00:46:31,681
the,

1751
00:46:31,681 --> 00:46:31,981
the,

1752
00:46:31,981 --> 00:46:33,540
the concept of the Muse,

1753
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:33,840
you know,

1754
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,080
it's so widely accepted that you're
getting these ideas from somewhere else.

1755
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:38,400
That's why I mean when you say,

1756
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:38,791
you know,

1757
00:46:38,791 --> 00:46:40,260
I'm trying to pretend
that I'm not special,

1758
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:43,830
I'm trying to pretend I'm not
a freaking rock star from Mars.

1759
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:44,281
You know,

1760
00:46:44,281 --> 00:46:44,491
when he,

1761
00:46:44,491 --> 00:46:46,020
when he hits says shit like that,

1762
00:46:46,021 --> 00:46:49,890
like that is the exact opposite
of the true creative mindset.

1763
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:53,640
Like you cannot tune in to the greatness
of the universe if you really believe

1764
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:54,420
that,

1765
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,450
unless it's performance art and
then it's fucking brilliant,

1766
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,050
right.

1767
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,130
If he's really doing it,

1768
00:46:59,131 --> 00:47:00,450
his own Coen brothers for sure.

1769
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:00,881
Well,

1770
00:47:00,881 --> 00:47:01,151
yeah.

1771
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:01,840
Then yeah,

1772
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,411
I always,

1773
00:47:02,411 --> 00:47:07,411
I don't know how many times I've watched
an asshole on TV and in the back of my

1774
00:47:07,421 --> 00:47:09,580
head thought if this was performance art,

1775
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,280
this will be the greatest
artist of all time.

1776
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:12,970
Yeah.

1777
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:13,271
You know,

1778
00:47:13,271 --> 00:47:15,620
performance art turns everything into,

1779
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,181
yeah,

1780
00:47:16,181 --> 00:47:17,050
but don't you guys aren't,

1781
00:47:17,051 --> 00:47:20,470
you guys were skeptical when you see
people like Brody Stevens where the normal

1782
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:20,801
personal,

1783
00:47:20,801 --> 00:47:21,880
she bro Steven that go up,

1784
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:24,730
that person is just fucking
crazy and angry map.

1785
00:47:24,731 --> 00:47:26,530
But then you talked to him
backstage and you're like,

1786
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:26,831
oh,

1787
00:47:26,831 --> 00:47:27,580
I get it.

1788
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,910
He is being almost like
character of himself

1789
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:30,281
Brody.

1790
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:31,900
So obviously a carrot it dude,

1791
00:47:31,901 --> 00:47:32,734
it's so,

1792
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:36,010
most people think most people
that see Brody think that that's,

1793
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:36,790
that's him.

1794
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:37,181
Yeah.

1795
00:47:37,181 --> 00:47:38,550
I think there's a big devastating Brody,

1796
00:47:38,551 --> 00:47:39,820
Stevens and Charlie Sheen,

1797
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,910
the huge difference between
how they're doing it yet.

1798
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,510
So I need this Brody's consent.

1799
00:47:43,511 --> 00:47:44,291
Tell him jokes,

1800
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:45,124
man.

1801
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:46,470
Yeah.

1802
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:47,303
Brody's going.

1803
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:50,260
I was over there in Iraq.

1804
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,281
Okay.

1805
00:47:51,281 --> 00:47:52,030
I,

1806
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:52,930
I was there.

1807
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,640
I was in Desert Storm.

1808
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:55,751
Yeah,

1809
00:47:55,751 --> 00:47:56,950
I was an Iraqi soldier.

1810
00:47:56,951 --> 00:47:58,000
But that's neither here or there.

1811
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,470
That's really obvious.

1812
00:47:59,471 --> 00:48:00,200
He's joking.

1813
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,560
It's really what's,

1814
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:02,291
what's his name?

1815
00:48:02,291 --> 00:48:03,130
The redneck comic.

1816
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:03,590
That's nice.

1817
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:03,870
You know,

1818
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:05,220
that's the whole character.

1819
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,030
But the big guy that's
on that tour with a,

1820
00:48:07,031 --> 00:48:07,864
get her done,

1821
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:08,680
get her done guy,

1822
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,181
that guy.

1823
00:48:09,181 --> 00:48:10,090
He's a complete character.

1824
00:48:10,091 --> 00:48:11,950
But even most people
think that's exactly him.

1825
00:48:11,951 --> 00:48:12,540
I thought it would,

1826
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:13,690
but that's just a good character.

1827
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:16,180
There's a difference between
that and an angry person.

1828
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,530
An angry crazy person.

1829
00:48:17,531 --> 00:48:18,430
He's not acting crazy.

1830
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,390
He's just being a character.

1831
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:20,440
Yeah.

1832
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,161
He's funny,

1833
00:48:21,161 --> 00:48:21,431
man.

1834
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:23,620
Brody is like Brody,

1835
00:48:23,621 --> 00:48:25,060
someone where if you,

1836
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,830
no matter what's happening,

1837
00:48:26,831 --> 00:48:27,700
if you're around him,

1838
00:48:27,701 --> 00:48:29,110
something funny is happening.

1839
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,200
Like he has a constant gravity of absurd,

1840
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:33,580
hilarious things happening.

1841
00:48:33,581 --> 00:48:37,090
Either things that he's making
happen or just stuff that happens.

1842
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:37,481
Yeah,

1843
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:37,781
I don't,

1844
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:38,170
I don't,

1845
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:40,060
I don't just think of him as being this,

1846
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:40,900
you know,

1847
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:41,680
like,

1848
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,630
it's not like watching an asshole,

1849
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:43,991
you know,

1850
00:48:43,991 --> 00:48:44,441
and saying,

1851
00:48:44,441 --> 00:48:44,651
you know,

1852
00:48:44,651 --> 00:48:45,670
is this guy faking it?

1853
00:48:45,671 --> 00:48:45,881
It's like,

1854
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:46,421
it's obvious.

1855
00:48:46,421 --> 00:48:47,011
He's faking it.

1856
00:48:47,011 --> 00:48:47,844
It's fun.

1857
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:48,790
It's fun to watch.

1858
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:49,340
What's,

1859
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:52,870
when you watch something
like real housewives of
Beverly Hills and you see I'm

1860
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,940
fucking Kelsey Grammer's ex wife.

1861
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:56,770
Holy Shit.

1862
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:00,220
What a reprehensible human being.

1863
00:49:00,221 --> 00:49:01,720
What a lizard person.

1864
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,940
What a just a creepy,

1865
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,110
terrible nebula.

1866
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,830
Nasty little dried up hooker.

1867
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,150
Holy Shit.

1868
00:49:10,151 --> 00:49:12,550
She scares me like almost like a demon,

1869
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,670
like almost like some low level demon,

1870
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:15,100
like,

1871
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:15,521
like in the,

1872
00:49:15,521 --> 00:49:19,000
in the upper upper echelons of hell.

1873
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,490
Just like some nasty death warm.

1874
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,770
And she goes on Howard stern and starts
talking shit about Kelsey Grammar.

1875
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:31,120
You know when meanwhile you were married
to him for how long you have children

1876
00:49:31,241 --> 00:49:34,810
with him and your children are going to
hear you talking shit about him that you

1877
00:49:34,811 --> 00:49:34,901
do.

1878
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:35,440
You're going to,

1879
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,010
you're going to go on the stern show
just so you can get some press for your

1880
00:49:39,011 --> 00:49:42,220
fucking shitty Beverly Hills housewife
thing and you're going to sacrifice all

1881
00:49:42,221 --> 00:49:43,870
these years of this relationship,

1882
00:49:43,871 --> 00:49:45,130
the intimacy that you guys share.

1883
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,630
You're just going to blurt that out.

1884
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,310
Like you're a piece of shit.

1885
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:52,390
You're not a 20 year old girl that's
making a mistake and you're some 40 year

1886
00:49:52,391 --> 00:49:54,430
old hooker that's cashing in or chips,

1887
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:54,851
you know,

1888
00:49:54,851 --> 00:49:56,470
and talking about how she wants more,

1889
00:49:56,471 --> 00:49:56,681
you know,

1890
00:49:56,681 --> 00:49:57,041
I want,

1891
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:57,851
I want all his money.

1892
00:49:57,851 --> 00:49:58,240
I don't want this.

1893
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:58,901
He left me,

1894
00:49:58,901 --> 00:50:00,040
he left me like,

1895
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:00,191
well,

1896
00:50:00,191 --> 00:50:04,450
what did they have to deal with while
he was with you at fucking monster?

1897
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,590
That's a price you pay,

1898
00:50:05,591 --> 00:50:05,921
man.

1899
00:50:05,921 --> 00:50:06,550
For all those people.

1900
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:06,800
There was,

1901
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,200
um,

1902
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,620
I did US magazine,

1903
00:50:08,621 --> 00:50:08,741
you know,

1904
00:50:08,741 --> 00:50:09,311
I used to do those,

1905
00:50:09,311 --> 00:50:09,520
uh,

1906
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,450
me and Chris Mcguire,

1907
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:13,600
which is to do these things where
you look at the way people dressed,

1908
00:50:13,601 --> 00:50:14,980
any write things about it,

1909
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:15,281
you know,

1910
00:50:15,281 --> 00:50:15,551
you're right.

1911
00:50:15,551 --> 00:50:16,450
Like little quotes about him,

1912
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,580
and I'll never forget this one guy.

1913
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:23,470
It was a Kelsey Grammer standing there
with Camille when she was in her prime.

1914
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:23,771
You know,

1915
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,150
it's when she was a playboy playmate.

1916
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,620
She was way too hot for him.

1917
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:27,601
And the,

1918
00:50:27,601 --> 00:50:27,880
the,

1919
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,240
the quote underneath it said,

1920
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:31,550
it's a story as old as time,

1921
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,870
that's all the guy said.

1922
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,490
Like whoever the writer
was that said that.

1923
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:35,091
And I was like,

1924
00:50:35,091 --> 00:50:35,630
Bingo,

1925
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:36,463
you just nailed it.

1926
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:37,070
You don't even,

1927
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:38,750
you don't even have to
pretend here's his ugly,

1928
00:50:38,751 --> 00:50:39,890
goofy looking fuck.

1929
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:40,400
You know,

1930
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,390
who just happens to be rich and famous
and he's with this vapid Super Hottie,

1931
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:44,841
you know,

1932
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:45,530
Bang.

1933
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:46,240
There it is.

1934
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,130
Tada.

1935
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:49,640
And he's so happy with themselves and
he will go and do these interviews and

1936
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:51,770
talk about how much he loves
her and how amazing it was.

1937
00:50:51,771 --> 00:50:54,440
And she completes it and then he
leaves her for a flight attendant.

1938
00:50:54,441 --> 00:50:56,090
I mean it's fucking great stuff.

1939
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,330
If she was doing performance art,

1940
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,320
if she was faking it,

1941
00:51:00,321 --> 00:51:00,561
you know,

1942
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:01,820
it would be absolutely brilliant.

1943
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:02,690
But she's not,

1944
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,010
there's no way she's
that good of an actress.

1945
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:07,370
She would have been fucking Oscar Wilde
by now trying to be some 40 year old

1946
00:51:07,371 --> 00:51:07,791
lady,

1947
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:08,121
you know,

1948
00:51:08,121 --> 00:51:10,880
with a bunch of 20 year old boyfriends
that she flaunts on the show.

1949
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:11,151
You know,

1950
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,980
before she was even divorced on the show.

1951
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:13,440
That's the thing.

1952
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,890
I can't believe I'm talking about
the real housewives of Beverly Hills,

1953
00:51:15,891 --> 00:51:16,730
but I got sucked in.

1954
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,860
But before she was even
divorced with them,

1955
00:51:18,861 --> 00:51:22,460
she was hanging out with all these
young guys that were her friends,

1956
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:22,971
you know,

1957
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:26,750
and that drives me fucking bananas.

1958
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:31,190
I have friends that have girlfriends that
have guy friends and they'd go on pal

1959
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:33,110
around with these guy
friends and I'm like,

1960
00:51:33,111 --> 00:51:33,681
Yo Dude,

1961
00:51:33,681 --> 00:51:36,500
you know you need a fucking
nip this shit right in the bud.

1962
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:39,650
You're girlfriend is hot and she's
hanging around with a bunch of guys that

1963
00:51:39,651 --> 00:51:42,920
she's been pals with since she moved
here to Hollywood two years ago.

1964
00:51:42,921 --> 00:51:44,470
Whatever she wants to,

1965
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:46,340
they want to fuck her for sure.

1966
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:46,670
You know,

1967
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:47,780
she might want to be their friend.

1968
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:50,120
She might think that there's
somehow or another keep platonic.

1969
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:51,680
But any of those weird,

1970
00:51:51,681 --> 00:51:55,070
creepy situations where you've got
a girl with a bunch of guy friends,

1971
00:51:55,071 --> 00:51:56,150
they all want to fuck,

1972
00:51:56,151 --> 00:51:56,540
Huh?

1973
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:56,901
Yeah.

1974
00:51:56,901 --> 00:51:57,734
All of them.

1975
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:00,590
Have you ever had a girl that was hot
that you were friends with or you weren't

1976
00:52:00,591 --> 00:52:01,760
somehow or another trying to think,

1977
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:03,200
how am I going to get to fuck her?

1978
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,260
How am I going to get to to
move this into us having sex?

1979
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,213
My mother,

1980
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,280
I never once thought that about her.

1981
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:12,283
Sorry.

1982
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:13,993
Sorry,

1983
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,350
Duncan just went straight red banner.

1984
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:20,630
Let's break this up real quick while
we're here because I'm glad you're here

1985
00:52:20,631 --> 00:52:21,800
because I wanted to
talk to you about this.

1986
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,020
There's a Cornell study that,

1987
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:24,271
uh,

1988
00:52:24,271 --> 00:52:28,940
it was just a put online or a lot of
people are a debating what exactly this

1989
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:29,540
means,

1990
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:33,680
but what they're saying is that there's
an error in the orbit of the moon.

1991
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:37,550
There's an eccentricity in the orbit
of the moon that they think will be,

1992
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:38,090
um,

1993
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:38,751
would be,

1994
00:52:38,751 --> 00:52:39,381
what are you doing over there,

1995
00:52:39,381 --> 00:52:40,214
Phil?

1996
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,173
Toothpaste.

1997
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:42,110
Okay.

1998
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:42,601
There's a,

1999
00:52:42,601 --> 00:52:47,601
an error error in the orbit of the
moon that they believe is going to,

2000
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:48,590
um,

2001
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:49,910
it's going to be a,

2002
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:55,150
they believe you can listen to be stubborn
fucking shit brain from 12 hours in a

2003
00:52:55,371 --> 00:52:56,060
fire plan.

2004
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:59,600
I'm an entire pretending
I'm not delivering the
fricking goods at every turn.

2005
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,120
What they're saying is there's something
wrong with the orbit of the moon that

2006
00:53:02,121 --> 00:53:03,530
can be attributed to a large,

2007
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:04,010
uh,

2008
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:05,510
extra solar system planet.

2009
00:53:05,511 --> 00:53:08,720
Like they're thinking there's
something out there that's much,

2010
00:53:08,721 --> 00:53:09,770
much bigger than Jupiter.

2011
00:53:09,771 --> 00:53:11,390
About four times the size of Jupiter,

2012
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:12,320
and this is,

2013
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:17,320
this is just one of several things that
I've been following over the last couple

2014
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:18,080
of months where there's,

2015
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,830
there's a bunch of different studies that
are talking about this planet x thing,

2016
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:24,110
but apparently it's,

2017
00:53:24,111 --> 00:53:28,800
they're really close to saying that
there is something beyond Neptune,

2018
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,810
beyond Pluto is not real anymore.

2019
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:34,710
But something out there like way out
there that's four times the size of

2020
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:35,544
Jupiter,

2021
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:37,440
some enormous fucking planet.

2022
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:38,840
I've seen that.

2023
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:39,960
How have we missed it?

2024
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:40,950
I don't know.

2025
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:41,790
It's a big question.

2026
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:42,683
They don't know.

2027
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:44,850
It might be just so fucking far out there.

2028
00:53:44,851 --> 00:53:46,710
It might be really cold
so we can't see it.

2029
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:47,400
You know,

2030
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,640
they're thinking that this thing is
by calling it inside our solar system.

2031
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:54,660
I think what they're
saying is that it's more,

2032
00:53:54,661 --> 00:53:57,900
it's further away from
Pluto than Pluto is from us,

2033
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:02,760
but yet it's still in some sort of an
orbit and it's huge and it's way out

2034
00:54:02,761 --> 00:54:02,990
there.

2035
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,020
So this is like,

2036
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:06,510
this is the planet acts Nibiru thing.

2037
00:54:06,511 --> 00:54:11,511
Everyone talks about the idea that it
smashes into us every certain amount of

2038
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:12,030
time.

2039
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:12,300
Well,

2040
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,380
it depends on who you're asking.

2041
00:54:13,381 --> 00:54:13,701
I mean,

2042
00:54:13,701 --> 00:54:14,890
do you know if you,

2043
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,880
if you talk to,

2044
00:54:15,881 --> 00:54:16,350
uh,

2045
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:17,700
the people that believe that,

2046
00:54:17,701 --> 00:54:17,950
you know,

2047
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:19,780
the earth was created this way and the,

2048
00:54:19,781 --> 00:54:20,011
you know,

2049
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:20,110
the,

2050
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:23,610
it's actually detailed according to
Zechariah Cichon in the Sumerian text,

2051
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:24,990
what they think is that,

2052
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,580
that somehow or another,

2053
00:54:26,581 --> 00:54:31,350
this extra solar planet or this planet
is on an elliptical orbit rather.

2054
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:31,981
And,

2055
00:54:31,981 --> 00:54:32,280
uh,

2056
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,330
it takes 3000,

2057
00:54:33,331 --> 00:54:36,360
600 years to come into line with a,

2058
00:54:36,361 --> 00:54:39,060
with earth and it comes near
us and fucks everything up.

2059
00:54:39,061 --> 00:54:41,250
And then the Annunaki jump off and they,

2060
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:43,770
they lived off their boat
onto our boat and go,

2061
00:54:43,771 --> 00:54:43,951
hey,

2062
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:44,784
what's going on over here?

2063
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,540
And then they come check us out and
then make us slaves for a little bit,

2064
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:50,340
make us mined for gold and erase our
memories and fly back in the space.

2065
00:54:50,341 --> 00:54:50,521
I mean,

2066
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:51,930
I don't know what the
fuck think exactly thing,

2067
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:54,120
but you know,

2068
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:55,051
when you look at,

2069
00:54:55,051 --> 00:54:55,350
uh,

2070
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:55,860
you know,

2071
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:56,390
the,

2072
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:56,941
what the,

2073
00:54:56,941 --> 00:55:00,060
the really interesting shit about what
they figured out was that they already

2074
00:55:00,061 --> 00:55:01,330
knew back then the,

2075
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:01,740
in this,

2076
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:05,820
according to Zacharias itching that
earth had been hit by a large planet and

2077
00:55:05,821 --> 00:55:06,900
that's what created the moon.

2078
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:09,930
We didn't know that until
like fairly recently.

2079
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,520
That's like one of the
most recent theories.

2080
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:16,350
There's earth one and earth too and earth
one was hit by something like the size

2081
00:55:16,351 --> 00:55:19,630
of fucking Mars or some enormous
planet and it created also,

2082
00:55:19,631 --> 00:55:20,910
it created the asteroid belt.

2083
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:22,230
That's another theory about that.

2084
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:22,740
You know,

2085
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:23,161
there's a,

2086
00:55:23,161 --> 00:55:23,994
there's a giant,

2087
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:25,560
this is another thing I read them.

2088
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:27,060
I need to find out if this is true or not.

2089
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:32,390
But that bodes law is a law that you
look at the gravity of one planet and you

2090
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:37,230
can extrapolate where the
next planet will be based on,

2091
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:37,470
you know,

2092
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:40,560
how dense the planet is and what the
gravity of it is and that what the mass of

2093
00:55:40,561 --> 00:55:41,130
it is.

2094
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:44,880
And it works on every planet in our
solar system except for Mars and Jupiter.

2095
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:47,100
And that there's should be
a planet in between there.

2096
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:49,170
And that's where the asteroid belt is.

2097
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,400
So the idea is that,

2098
00:55:50,401 --> 00:55:50,671
you know,

2099
00:55:50,671 --> 00:55:54,720
something was there collided with a
reason why there's not a planet there.

2100
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,553
Did they have any?

2101
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:56,280
No.

2102
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:56,760
I mean,

2103
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,001
look,

2104
00:55:57,001 --> 00:55:59,670
there's a bunch of theories about
why the asteroid belt exists,

2105
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:00,181
you know,

2106
00:56:00,181 --> 00:56:03,480
and one of them being that
it's like some of the early,

2107
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:04,201
the,

2108
00:56:04,201 --> 00:56:06,390
the fabric of the very solar
system that it's just like,

2109
00:56:06,391 --> 00:56:06,601
you know,

2110
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:07,770
from the forming of the solar system,

2111
00:56:07,771 --> 00:56:08,460
this is like,

2112
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:08,640
you know,

2113
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,260
some just leftover shit that's there.

2114
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:14,250
And then the other one is that it's a
planet and got fucking nailed and just

2115
00:56:14,251 --> 00:56:18,270
destroyed and became this
gigantic belt of rocks and shit.

2116
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:20,370
Fucking crazy.

2117
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:21,900
The idea that planets,

2118
00:56:21,901 --> 00:56:25,690
we know this for a fact that not
only do planet slam into each other,

2119
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,090
but galaxy slam into each other,

2120
00:56:28,091 --> 00:56:28,660
right?

2121
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,590
They hit each other.

2122
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,453
Sure.

2123
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:31,780
Fucking a man.

2124
00:56:31,781 --> 00:56:32,291
Could you imagine,

2125
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:37,000
look up in the sky and every day this
like star just keeps getting brighter,

2126
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:37,450
you know,

2127
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:39,310
and you're some asshole caveman,

2128
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:43,240
you have no idea what the fuck is really
going on and this thing is coming down

2129
00:56:43,241 --> 00:56:45,230
and it's going to slam it
to the moon and you know,

2130
00:56:45,231 --> 00:56:46,890
and kill everybody there.

2131
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,160
So there's also,

2132
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:51,070
there's a lot of theories about the solar
system that are really odd and some of

2133
00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:53,680
them that some of the planets that
exist now weren't there before.

2134
00:56:53,681 --> 00:56:54,514
Like Saturn.

2135
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,980
The Saturn is a fairly recent
occurrence in the solar system.

2136
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:57,940
I mean it's,

2137
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,710
it sounds like a total horse shit.

2138
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:01,300
Start exposing herself.

2139
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,470
Well,

2140
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:04,030
you know the idea on,

2141
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:05,140
on planets that,

2142
00:57:05,141 --> 00:57:05,411
you know,

2143
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:06,490
like rogue planets,

2144
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:07,060
yes,

2145
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,640
they get sucked in front.

2146
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:08,920
There,

2147
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:13,720
they come from somewhere else and they
get sucked into our solar system and gets

2148
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,850
sucked into our gravity or
any other source systems.

2149
00:57:15,851 --> 00:57:16,590
Gravity.

2150
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:17,141
And there's a,

2151
00:57:17,141 --> 00:57:18,880
an interesting thing about this Pluto,

2152
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:22,810
this planet that's outside of Pluto is
that they're saying the gravity of this

2153
00:57:22,811 --> 00:57:22,931
thing.

2154
00:57:22,931 --> 00:57:24,200
One of the reasons why they,

2155
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,470
they figured out that there's
something huge out there.

2156
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:29,650
The gravity of this thing is
hurling comments in our direction.

2157
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:31,990
Weird

2158
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,140
fucking weird man.

2159
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:36,100
You never know.

2160
00:57:36,101 --> 00:57:38,480
Like the thing that
freaks me out is that a,

2161
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,151
what do they call it?

2162
00:57:39,151 --> 00:57:43,210
Pulse ours or they say like a [inaudible]
star close enough can have like a

2163
00:57:43,211 --> 00:57:46,210
super pulse that just flashes hyper Nova,

2164
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,240
hyper Nova and were just dead instantly.

2165
00:57:49,241 --> 00:57:51,640
Like you're just driving home
and suddenly the sky turns,

2166
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,330
you drive home and you
get an Smi hits you,

2167
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,120
you're just dead,

2168
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:55,510
you know,

2169
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:56,343
same shit.

2170
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:58,450
It's kind of different.

2171
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:02,450
Know you'd booked di both things getting
Super Nova and a semi hit like this and

2172
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:02,930
mine.

2173
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:03,930
A supernova.

2174
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:05,611
Well for you,

2175
00:58:05,611 --> 00:58:05,731
Oh,

2176
00:58:05,731 --> 00:58:06,060
you're a,

2177
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:08,060
if you're a selfish con
doesn't think about the whole

2178
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:09,010
rest of the world.

2179
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,510
Yes.

2180
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:11,920
It's the same thing Brian.

2181
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:15,940
It's just like me taking pills.

2182
00:58:15,941 --> 00:58:17,290
The world will die right now.

2183
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:19,960
I want to listen to some fucking music.

2184
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:20,981
Yeah,

2185
00:58:20,981 --> 00:58:21,580
you might,

2186
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,530
you might not know the
difference or you might,

2187
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,520
did you see that new,

2188
00:58:24,521 --> 00:58:28,960
a LCD screen that Microsoft announced
the other day or then this is like they

2189
00:58:28,961 --> 00:58:30,430
showed what's in their labs right now,

2190
00:58:30,431 --> 00:58:33,550
what they're working on with
the future of LCD screens on,

2191
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:34,563
it's called a

2192
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:40,060
steerable auto stereo three d display.

2193
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:41,440
And what's cool is it's like,

2194
00:58:41,441 --> 00:58:45,580
it's pretty much like a a surface
and you can see the surface.

2195
00:58:45,581 --> 00:58:49,150
So imagine like an iPad on a table
but really big kind of like their,

2196
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:51,100
their Microsoft surface and surface.

2197
00:58:51,101 --> 00:58:51,520
Yeah.

2198
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:51,731
So,

2199
00:58:51,731 --> 00:58:56,020
but now you can grab things and it
knows how the distance up and down is.

2200
00:58:56,021 --> 00:59:00,040
And you could do like three d kind of
like kind of just like the future when you

2201
00:59:00,041 --> 00:59:03,250
see in the movies where they're like
pulling up displays and tapping things and

2202
00:59:03,251 --> 00:59:04,084
stuff like that.

2203
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:05,890
And they have this really cool video.

2204
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:09,110
The name of the video is
called Applied Sciences Group.

2205
00:59:09,111 --> 00:59:10,810
Smart interactive displays.

2206
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:11,673
Microsoft.

2207
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:13,280
So great man.

2208
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:13,830
Yeah,

2209
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:13,951
I'll,

2210
00:59:13,951 --> 00:59:14,530
I'll tweet it.

2211
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:15,430
And what's so cool about it,

2212
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:16,331
it's just the,

2213
00:59:16,331 --> 00:59:17,110
the future of,

2214
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:17,740
you know,

2215
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:20,350
like surfing the Internet and pretty
soon you're just gonna be like this.

2216
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:21,370
Like you're going to pull up,

2217
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:22,221
take your hand,

2218
00:59:22,221 --> 00:59:23,600
grab at a browser,

2219
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:24,051
you know,

2220
00:59:24,051 --> 00:59:28,250
just sit there and play with like air
and you're going to be able to like just,

2221
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:28,581
you know,

2222
00:59:28,581 --> 00:59:29,650
move things around.

2223
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:30,090
It's like,

2224
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:33,190
it's intertwined like connect
or Microsoft surfaces.

2225
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:36,260
Everything's going to become an
interactive surface no matter what it is.

2226
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:41,420
You won't be able to sell shit unless
it's got like some access to the internet,

2227
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:42,980
everything like this table,

2228
00:59:42,981 --> 00:59:43,550
everything.

2229
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:44,960
But what's cool is the depth of it.

2230
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:45,651
And they also,

2231
00:59:45,651 --> 00:59:46,281
in the same video,

2232
00:59:46,281 --> 00:59:51,281
they were showing the future 3d where
like where it's a flashing these lights at

2233
00:59:51,831 --> 00:59:53,900
your face so fast that
you can't even tell.

2234
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,730
So we will give you
three d images without,

2235
00:59:55,731 --> 00:59:56,090
you know,

2236
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:57,110
the glasses of course.

2237
00:59:57,111 --> 01:00:00,350
But it shows how they do it and he goes
into it and explains and shows how it

2238
01:00:00,351 --> 01:00:01,011
works and stuff.

2239
01:00:01,011 --> 01:00:02,390
It's pretty interesting video.

2240
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,470
I'll post it right there.

2241
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:04,993
Wow.

2242
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,640
It's trippy shit.

2243
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:09,750
He saw this,

2244
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,040
um,

2245
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,560
this planet thing is really
fucking freaking me out,

2246
01:00:12,561 --> 01:00:13,340
mom.

2247
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:14,173
Well,

2248
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:14,561
yeah,

2249
01:00:14,561 --> 01:00:18,250
I mean a lot of this stuff like something
that I think about all the time,

2250
01:00:18,251 --> 01:00:22,690
it's like how much are we
affected by the solar flares?

2251
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:26,290
And like a sociological way
and it's such a crazy idea,

2252
01:00:26,291 --> 01:00:26,810
but

2253
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:27,030
well,

2254
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:30,740
it's not if he considered that the
moon's orbit affects people's behavior,

2255
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:31,270
is that,

2256
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:34,490
I mean there's say there's
no statistics to back up,

2257
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:34,791
you know,

2258
01:00:34,791 --> 01:00:37,340
like that there's more
activity during lunar,

2259
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:37,760
uh,

2260
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,390
you know,

2261
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:39,223
other events.

2262
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:39,801
Right?

2263
01:00:39,801 --> 01:00:40,310
Isn't that true?

2264
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:40,760
There's no,

2265
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,260
there's no statistics to back that up.

2266
01:00:42,261 --> 01:00:42,920
Isn't that true?

2267
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:43,260
Uh,

2268
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,560
I cause cops always swear by it.

2269
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:45,871
Yeah,

2270
01:00:45,871 --> 01:00:46,130
no,

2271
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:47,000
I think there are,

2272
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:47,810
I've heard,

2273
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:48,291
I don't know.

2274
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:49,720
I never really investigated and,

2275
01:00:49,721 --> 01:00:51,080
but I always thought that was true.

2276
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:55,970
But if they can figure out
that there's a planet deep,

2277
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:56,451
deep,

2278
01:00:56,451 --> 01:00:57,111
somewhere in the,

2279
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:59,120
in our galaxy that they don't know about,

2280
01:00:59,121 --> 01:01:02,660
just from the effect that it has
on the moon's gravitational field,

2281
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:05,540
then that means it must be
having an effect on us too.

2282
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:08,630
Like if it's literally
like some planet far away,

2283
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:12,790
it's so powerful that it's altering the
moon a little bit and it would be a fact

2284
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,380
that same minor pole,

2285
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:16,700
it'd be affecting us too.

2286
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:17,930
Maybe the storms,

2287
01:01:17,931 --> 01:01:18,201
you know,

2288
01:01:18,201 --> 01:01:19,034
maybe the weather

2289
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:19,991
it does.

2290
01:01:19,991 --> 01:01:20,231
I mean,

2291
01:01:20,231 --> 01:01:20,761
look at what,

2292
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:21,700
what sun does.

2293
01:01:21,701 --> 01:01:23,180
Just lack of vitamin D.

2294
01:01:23,181 --> 01:01:23,351
I mean,

2295
01:01:23,351 --> 01:01:25,270
we know it actually makes
something in your body.

2296
01:01:25,271 --> 01:01:28,750
It actually causes a vitamin
to be produced by your
body that makes you happy.

2297
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:29,340
You know,

2298
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:29,511
the,

2299
01:01:29,511 --> 01:01:31,450
the aides and your
happiness and your health.

2300
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,640
And when you don't get that all the time,

2301
01:01:33,641 --> 01:01:33,851
you know,

2302
01:01:33,851 --> 01:01:34,690
for long periods of time,

2303
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,130
people get sick and depressed.

2304
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:36,993
Yeah,

2305
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:37,570
they have,

2306
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:39,550
it's called seasonal affective disorder.

2307
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:40,031
Yeah,

2308
01:01:40,031 --> 01:01:40,570
I mean that,

2309
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:41,590
that's seasonal.

2310
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:42,880
If you're in a place where,

2311
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:43,660
you know,

2312
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:44,800
that is a seasonal event,

2313
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:46,810
like in Boston and
Boston during the winter,

2314
01:01:46,811 --> 01:01:48,820
people do get depressed
and that's why it's,

2315
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:49,743
it's called,

2316
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:51,030
it's vitamin D deficient.

2317
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:51,730
It's a lot of it,

2318
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:52,481
but it's also just,

2319
01:01:52,481 --> 01:01:53,650
it's fucking dreary.

2320
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:53,921
Yeah.

2321
01:01:53,921 --> 01:01:54,551
That's what it is.

2322
01:01:54,551 --> 01:01:55,570
Sunlight lamps,

2323
01:01:55,571 --> 01:01:56,231
they're supposed to help.

2324
01:01:56,231 --> 01:01:57,220
Did you knew it's snowed in?

2325
01:01:57,221 --> 01:01:58,030
Burbank.

2326
01:01:58,030 --> 01:01:58,420
Did it?

2327
01:01:58,420 --> 01:01:58,740
Wait,

2328
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:02,200
I it like huge chunks of
snow fell from that ground.

2329
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:02,291
Uh,

2330
01:02:02,291 --> 01:02:04,960
two days ago I went outside hail or snow?

2331
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,270
Well it wasn't hail because
hail is usually hard,

2332
01:02:07,271 --> 01:02:10,120
but it seemed like really like wet snow.

2333
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:10,570
Wow.

2334
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:13,300
But they covered the whole
roads and stuff like that.

2335
01:02:13,301 --> 01:02:14,410
And were you driving?

2336
01:02:14,411 --> 01:02:14,621
No,

2337
01:02:14,621 --> 01:02:17,590
it was really early in the morning
and then it melted super quick.

2338
01:02:17,591 --> 01:02:18,850
But I mean it snowed all day.

2339
01:02:18,851 --> 01:02:20,220
It ridiculous.

2340
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,210
Wow.

2341
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:22,021
Well this,

2342
01:02:22,021 --> 01:02:25,860
this and a couple of websites here I'm
looking at when it comes to the moon and

2343
01:02:25,861 --> 01:02:29,730
one of them saying that the claims of
a correlation between lunar phases to

2344
01:02:29,731 --> 01:02:33,090
human behavior does not hold
up under scientific scrutiny.

2345
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,220
And they're saying so
they're saying that there's,

2346
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:37,380
there's no connection.

2347
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:39,660
But then other people were saying
that there is a connection.

2348
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:40,740
It's interesting.

2349
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:41,910
Other people think that,

2350
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:42,773
um,

2351
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:43,201
you know,

2352
01:02:43,201 --> 01:02:44,034
it's just,

2353
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:46,890
it's really difficult to quantify,

2354
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:47,610
you know,

2355
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:48,150
how do you,

2356
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:49,320
how do you know,

2357
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:51,780
like if it really is a psycho,

2358
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:52,351
how do you know?

2359
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:53,700
I mean whether or not
it's actually called,

2360
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:54,090
but yes,

2361
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:58,230
you should be able to see just by like
hospital reports and prison and you know

2362
01:02:58,231 --> 01:03:00,180
police records and when
shouldn't you be able to see?

2363
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:02,970
I would imagine so meaning if
it's a little bit of a difference,

2364
01:03:02,971 --> 01:03:04,410
like a 1% difference,

2365
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:05,910
maybe it should be able to see,

2366
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:10,030
maybe that's like that it's just small
enough that it's the rate of accuracy.

2367
01:03:10,031 --> 01:03:10,541
You know what I mean?

2368
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:12,760
Like this test is only 99% accurate,

2369
01:03:12,761 --> 01:03:13,930
so it's kind of like the,

2370
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:16,930
you know the up down ratio.

2371
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:17,491
Yeah.

2372
01:03:17,491 --> 01:03:20,790
This is this one side is saying despite
the fact that no evidence of significant

2373
01:03:20,791 --> 01:03:22,440
correlation between phases of the moon,

2374
01:03:22,441 --> 01:03:24,510
dimensional cycle and fertility exist,

2375
01:03:24,511 --> 01:03:27,990
some people not only maintain that there
is but have a scientific explanation

2376
01:03:27,991 --> 01:03:29,580
for the non existent correlation.

2377
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:33,750
It could be that just people want to
believe it or could be just like people

2378
01:03:33,751 --> 01:03:37,710
would go nutty because back in the day
it was like bright outside at night.

2379
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:40,830
Whereas before you had to watch where
the fuck you walked and it was super dark

2380
01:03:40,831 --> 01:03:41,310
out.

2381
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:41,521
You know,

2382
01:03:41,521 --> 01:03:44,430
like a couple of times a year or
a couple of times a month rather,

2383
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:44,701
you know,

2384
01:03:44,701 --> 01:03:49,701
for a few days you get a giant spotlight
in the sky and so you could walk around

2385
01:03:50,251 --> 01:03:51,084
at night.

2386
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:51,931
You know what I mean?

2387
01:03:51,931 --> 01:03:53,250
And probably people did nuttier shit.

2388
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:58,070
If the moon affects the tides is
powerful enough to make tides come in and

2389
01:03:58,170 --> 01:03:59,860
tagged it can,

2390
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:04,070
I could totally see how it affect
whatever weird oceans in your brain,

2391
01:04:04,071 --> 01:04:06,560
whatever quantum motions
floating around up there.

2392
01:04:06,561 --> 01:04:08,000
I'm sure it affects that.

2393
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:08,331
Yeah,

2394
01:04:08,331 --> 01:04:09,170
there's that question,

2395
01:04:09,171 --> 01:04:09,381
right?

2396
01:04:09,381 --> 01:04:11,110
It's like how much of you are,

2397
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,930
is the chemical reactions it's going in
your body and how much of that can you

2398
01:04:14,931 --> 01:04:15,620
manipulate?

2399
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:17,240
How much of that can you manipulate with,

2400
01:04:17,241 --> 01:04:17,640
you know,

2401
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:22,640
an exercise to maintain your hormone
levels and for drinking water to maintain

2402
01:04:22,941 --> 01:04:24,080
your hydration.

2403
01:04:24,081 --> 01:04:24,914
So you're not,

2404
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:25,730
I mean,

2405
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:28,520
how much of you is a bunch
of these chemical reactions?

2406
01:04:28,521 --> 01:04:29,110
I mean,

2407
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:30,380
what your personality,

2408
01:04:30,381 --> 01:04:33,170
how much of that is dictated by
what you're taking into your body?

2409
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:34,723
It's quiet.

2410
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:38,150
It's got to be a percentage that that's
a much bigger percentage than the

2411
01:04:38,151 --> 01:04:38,984
fucking moon.

2412
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:39,151
Well,

2413
01:04:39,151 --> 01:04:40,170
one thing's for certain.

2414
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:42,120
If you are in pain,

2415
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:45,930
you're going to probably be an asshole
to the people around you in some way.

2416
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,190
If you're fucking hurting.

2417
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:52,110
You know the old classic when you walk
into the dishwasher with your Shin and

2418
01:04:52,111 --> 01:04:54,750
somebody nearby and says
anything to you like,

2419
01:04:54,751 --> 01:04:55,481
are you okay?

2420
01:04:55,481 --> 01:04:56,041
I'm Oh,

2421
01:04:56,041 --> 01:04:56,960
good fun.

2422
01:04:58,610 --> 01:05:00,060
Cause it hurts so bad.

2423
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:01,291
You know what I mean?

2424
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:01,830
It's like,

2425
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:03,030
so if you're in pain,

2426
01:05:03,031 --> 01:05:04,730
if you feel like shit in,

2427
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:05,640
in whatever way,

2428
01:05:05,641 --> 01:05:07,710
you feel like shit for whatever reason,

2429
01:05:07,711 --> 01:05:10,590
you're probably treating the
people around you like shit.

2430
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,180
He know the opposite of it.

2431
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:15,780
Take Ecstasy and sit next to the
stupidest person on the planet.

2432
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:17,380
You feel so good.

2433
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:17,741
You're like,

2434
01:05:17,741 --> 01:05:18,260
I love

2435
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:19,093
you.

2436
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:21,160
Really are amazing,

2437
01:05:21,161 --> 01:05:21,521
man.

2438
01:05:21,521 --> 01:05:22,271
You really are.

2439
01:05:22,271 --> 01:05:23,081
Your ideas are,

2440
01:05:23,081 --> 01:05:23,501
yeah,

2441
01:05:23,501 --> 01:05:24,161
they're good.

2442
01:05:24,161 --> 01:05:24,521
You're okay.

2443
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:25,540
But that's not good.

2444
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,463
Right?

2445
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:27,121
Well,

2446
01:05:27,121 --> 01:05:27,760
is it,

2447
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,180
is it,

2448
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:28,691
or is it,

2449
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:28,901
I mean,

2450
01:05:28,901 --> 01:05:32,650
is it good to be in wonder
of everyone even retards,

2451
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:33,101
you know?

2452
01:05:33,101 --> 01:05:34,030
Or is it,

2453
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:34,953
yes.

2454
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:35,980
I think at the,

2455
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:36,460
I think,

2456
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,293
I think it's a,

2457
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:42,600
whenever you get around that kind of
energy coming from someone where for

2458
01:05:42,611 --> 01:05:43,301
whatever reason,

2459
01:05:43,301 --> 01:05:44,950
when you run into someone really smart,

2460
01:05:44,951 --> 01:05:48,340
you get the sense that they've managed
to turn the judgment thing off and their

2461
01:05:48,341 --> 01:05:51,570
computer and they just like
you just because you're a,

2462
01:05:51,571 --> 01:05:55,360
you're having this bizarre experience
on the planet with them and they kind of

2463
01:05:55,361 --> 01:05:56,194
get it.

2464
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:57,990
That's one of the most healing things

2465
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:02,010
I used to at one point in my life when
when someone would be judging me and I

2466
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:03,280
would know they would be judging me,

2467
01:06:03,281 --> 01:06:04,510
I would feel insecure,

2468
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:05,410
I would get upset.

2469
01:06:05,411 --> 01:06:06,191
I would get like,

2470
01:06:06,191 --> 01:06:06,611
wow,

2471
01:06:06,611 --> 01:06:06,881
you know,

2472
01:06:06,881 --> 01:06:07,331
like man,

2473
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:08,670
maybe I'm a loser or maybe you know,

2474
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:08,951
I would,

2475
01:06:08,951 --> 01:06:10,150
if I felt like I was being,

2476
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:10,690
you know,

2477
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:11,800
unfairly scrutinized,

2478
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:12,790
I would just think it was,

2479
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:13,481
I'm just,

2480
01:06:13,481 --> 01:06:14,320
obviously I'm a loser.

2481
01:06:14,321 --> 01:06:14,891
I'm losing it.

2482
01:06:14,891 --> 01:06:16,630
This whatever this is
right now and this is,

2483
01:06:16,631 --> 01:06:17,560
this person doesn't like me.

2484
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:21,280
Now I have a completely different
effect now when someone,

2485
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:24,250
I feel like someone is judging me or
someone's being hypercritical or Shitty to

2486
01:06:24,251 --> 01:06:24,371
me,

2487
01:06:24,371 --> 01:06:24,940
I'm like,

2488
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,340
why are you being a cunt?

2489
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:26,830
Right?

2490
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:27,910
Because I'm nice.

2491
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:28,211
You know?

2492
01:06:28,211 --> 01:06:29,260
I tried to be nice to everybody.

2493
01:06:29,261 --> 01:06:31,870
Like there's no reason why this
has to be a douchey conversation.

2494
01:06:31,871 --> 01:06:32,180
Yeah.

2495
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:32,600
It's,

2496
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:33,550
if it's Douchey,

2497
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:34,180
you're,

2498
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:35,620
you're the one who
started the Douchey knows.

2499
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:35,990
Yeah.

2500
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:36,640
You know,

2501
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,590
and I think for a lot of people,

2502
01:06:38,591 --> 01:06:38,891
man,

2503
01:06:38,891 --> 01:06:42,280
that's like one of the biggest things
that they worry about in life is getting

2504
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:44,470
judged and criticized and shit.

2505
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:45,870
Yeah.

2506
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:46,280
Yeah.

2507
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,390
It's terrible when you're in,

2508
01:06:47,391 --> 01:06:51,370
especially if you're a kid and you're
around one of the powerful personalities,

2509
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:53,480
like decided that you're bad,

2510
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:54,520
you're a loser,

2511
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,240
you down and draws that out of you.

2512
01:06:56,241 --> 01:06:57,910
It's not like we're talking
about the gravity of the planet.

2513
01:06:57,911 --> 01:06:59,690
It's like if someone's judging you,

2514
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:04,840
there's a gravity that they're exerting
on you that can lead you into being the

2515
01:07:04,941 --> 01:07:06,200
thing that they think you are.

2516
01:07:06,201 --> 01:07:06,680
It's like,

2517
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,600
what's that bizarre idea where I,

2518
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:13,070
it's the observers effect when you're
looking at an an Adam or an electron or a

2519
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:13,551
photon.

2520
01:07:13,551 --> 01:07:16,850
I think it is that weird thing
where at the quantum level,

2521
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,210
things seem to go in the direction
of the way you expect them to.

2522
01:07:20,211 --> 01:07:21,830
They seem to be where you're looking.

2523
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:23,680
It's affected by you viewing this,

2524
01:07:23,681 --> 01:07:24,100
that,

2525
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:24,470
that,

2526
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:24,770
that,

2527
01:07:24,770 --> 01:07:26,450
I don't know the name for that
and I probably just butchered it,

2528
01:07:26,451 --> 01:07:31,451
but I'm saying is I think that that can
happen when you're around someone who

2529
01:07:32,061 --> 01:07:34,430
has a firm belief that you suck,

2530
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:35,660
you can suddenly,

2531
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:38,510
it'll start drawing out of
you the shitty behavior.

2532
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:42,800
Cause it's like you will start blossoming
out of you and it fucking sucks.

2533
01:07:42,801 --> 01:07:43,341
In the same way,

2534
01:07:43,341 --> 01:07:45,020
if you're around somebody who's,

2535
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:47,750
who really sees you and
sees how cool you are,

2536
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:49,760
then all of a sudden you're funnier.

2537
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:50,010
Yeah.

2538
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:50,250
You're,

2539
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:50,811
you know what I mean?

2540
01:07:50,811 --> 01:07:54,740
Because they're drawing the positive out
of you when you first start dating girl

2541
01:07:54,741 --> 01:07:56,150
and she really likes you and she's really,

2542
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,313
how funny are you?

2543
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,333
The funniest?

2544
01:07:58,380 --> 01:07:58,741
Funny.

2545
01:07:58,741 --> 01:07:59,380
You're hilarious.

2546
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:00,240
Every time you go to the movie,

2547
01:08:00,241 --> 01:08:01,950
you have the wideness shit to say,

2548
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:03,001
you go out to dinner,

2549
01:08:03,001 --> 01:08:04,200
you have the funniest thing to say.

2550
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:04,561
I mean,

2551
01:08:04,561 --> 01:08:06,480
this was so many guys I know,

2552
01:08:06,481 --> 01:08:06,960
um,

2553
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:07,260
that,

2554
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:07,501
you know,

2555
01:08:07,501 --> 01:08:09,120
started out doing stand up comedy.

2556
01:08:09,121 --> 01:08:11,820
The reason why they got funny
was to make girls laugh,

2557
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:12,471
you know?

2558
01:08:12,471 --> 01:08:12,731
Or they,

2559
01:08:12,731 --> 01:08:16,070
they started out like trying
to be the most and fun

2560
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:18,500
guy in the beginning of the relationship
when you first meet each other.

2561
01:08:18,501 --> 01:08:18,950
Yeah.

2562
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:19,161
You know,

2563
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:19,760
and that's,

2564
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:20,593
that's uh,

2565
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:22,310
I think I'm way funnier
when I'm broken now.

2566
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:23,144
Miserable,

2567
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:24,040
you know,

2568
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,370
cause I'm just fucking like,

2569
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,480
I don't know what I'm happy.

2570
01:08:26,481 --> 01:08:27,314
I'm just not,

2571
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,330
I'm being nice and funny to that person,

2572
01:08:29,450 --> 01:08:30,530
but like when I'm miserable,

2573
01:08:30,531 --> 01:08:31,880
I fucking think of evil,

2574
01:08:31,881 --> 01:08:32,271
deep,

2575
01:08:32,271 --> 01:08:32,631
dark,

2576
01:08:32,631 --> 01:08:33,321
crazy shit.

2577
01:08:33,321 --> 01:08:34,310
It seems like to me.

2578
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:35,600
But when you're around someone like,

2579
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:38,480
but imagine when you're
around someone who you know,

2580
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:41,810
thinks that you are a fucking asshole.

2581
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,111
I could,

2582
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:42,501
you know,

2583
01:08:42,501 --> 01:08:45,140
thinks that you're a moron
and you're around them.

2584
01:08:45,210 --> 01:08:47,290
I think Brian's just talking
about performing on stage.

2585
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:47,471
You're,

2586
01:08:47,471 --> 01:08:47,601
you're,

2587
01:08:47,601 --> 01:08:47,941
you're,

2588
01:08:47,941 --> 01:08:50,000
you're kind of going off
in a different direction.

2589
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:50,700
But I know what you're saying.

2590
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,100
What saying you need like,

2591
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:52,431
I mean,

2592
01:08:52,431 --> 01:08:53,510
that was kinnisons whole thing.

2593
01:08:53,511 --> 01:08:53,700
I mean,

2594
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:56,120
Kennison became really
funny because of pain.

2595
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:56,480
Right.

2596
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:56,691
You know,

2597
01:08:56,691 --> 01:08:57,140
because of,

2598
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:57,370
you know,

2599
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:59,390
I was married for two fucking years,

2600
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,113
you know,

2601
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:05,200
this second man is happy
because all that shit was his,

2602
01:09:05,201 --> 01:09:05,540
his,

2603
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:05,781
you know,

2604
01:09:05,781 --> 01:09:06,890
that wasn't him happy.

2605
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:07,790
That wasn't,

2606
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:08,210
you know,

2607
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:09,043
beautiful life.

2608
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:09,561
Well see,

2609
01:09:09,561 --> 01:09:10,311
here's the thing man,

2610
01:09:10,311 --> 01:09:11,600
this idea of happiness.

2611
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:14,150
We were just talking about it on
my podcast and someone's was like,

2612
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:15,740
why are you obsessed with being happy?

2613
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:17,420
Being happy is not what life's about.

2614
01:09:17,421 --> 01:09:18,231
It's not about getting,

2615
01:09:18,231 --> 01:09:19,064
it's not about,

2616
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:19,580
you know,

2617
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,320
Oh I feel good today.

2618
01:09:21,321 --> 01:09:22,550
It said that it was,

2619
01:09:22,551 --> 01:09:22,970
um,

2620
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:26,140
they made a really good point because I,

2621
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:31,190
happiness and sadness are two sides of
the same thing that if you pay too much

2622
01:09:31,191 --> 01:09:32,180
attention to them,

2623
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:32,990
you'll be,

2624
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:37,430
you'll begin to get caught up
in like chaos and randomness.

2625
01:09:37,431 --> 01:09:38,140
It's a okay.

2626
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:38,541
In the,

2627
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:39,380
in the Bhagavad Gita,

2628
01:09:39,381 --> 01:09:41,330
there is this great verse that says,

2629
01:09:41,331 --> 01:09:46,331
a wise man is not distressed or is not
disturbed by either happiness or sadness.

2630
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,280
There's your mind is,

2631
01:09:49,281 --> 01:09:52,280
does not shift according
to your mood states.

2632
01:09:52,281 --> 01:09:54,110
You're not plugging into the chemical,

2633
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:55,130
uh,

2634
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:58,880
the chemicals that are making you feel
stressed out or making you feel happy.

2635
01:09:59,160 --> 01:09:59,660
Um,

2636
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:00,560
you're above it.

2637
01:10:00,561 --> 01:10:01,430
You're transcendent,

2638
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:02,420
you've transcended it.

2639
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:03,980
And that's what I think happiness.

2640
01:10:03,981 --> 01:10:05,570
It would be a,

2641
01:10:05,571 --> 01:10:07,160
as opposed to the other kind of happiness,

2642
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:08,570
which you were saying isn't that bad,

2643
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:13,571
which is the ecstasy happiness or the
kind of like a happiness that comes when

2644
01:10:14,091 --> 01:10:18,490
Charlie Sheen does align of blow or the
kind of hat that kind of happiness and

2645
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,790
reduces the Moseley.

2646
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:20,991
Allegedly.

2647
01:10:20,991 --> 01:10:23,180
I don't think he's really
a on cocaine at all.

2648
01:10:23,181 --> 01:10:25,580
I don't think he's on any
drugs except Charlie's shade,

2649
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,670
which is apparently the name
of some new kind of mess.

2650
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:30,590
It's really just a new
method they invented.

2651
01:10:30,591 --> 01:10:31,760
We'll call this sheen.

2652
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:34,310
But I think that,

2653
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:39,530
so that's my idea of happiness is not
to get caught up in the mood states

2654
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:40,790
whether you're,

2655
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:42,170
cause you're going to feel like,

2656
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:43,004
shit,

2657
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,330
I'm on this planet.

2658
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,880
You have to feel like
you will feel like shit.

2659
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:47,660
You know why?

2660
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,490
Because everyone you know is going to die.

2661
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:50,540
And if they don't,

2662
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:52,160
it's because you died before them.

2663
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:53,390
And when someone dies,

2664
01:10:53,391 --> 01:10:54,930
it's sucks and you're right.

2665
01:10:54,931 --> 01:10:55,110
But

2666
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:56,850
that's just when someone dies.

2667
01:10:57,180 --> 01:10:57,631
You know?

2668
01:10:57,631 --> 01:11:01,410
I think a lot of people think that your
everyday life has to be filled with shit

2669
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:02,430
and that you have to,

2670
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:05,790
that's part of being a
human and that happiness is,

2671
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:09,540
you're saying that happiness is somehow
another transcending above emotions?

2672
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:10,770
I don't think it is.

2673
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:11,690
I think my,

2674
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:14,010
my personal happiness has been fun.

2675
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:14,761
It has been.

2676
01:11:14,761 --> 01:11:15,594
Laughter,

2677
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:16,800
having a good time,

2678
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:18,090
hanging out with friends,

2679
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,410
laughing with friends,

2680
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,041
laughing,

2681
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:20,910
doing shows,

2682
01:11:20,911 --> 01:11:22,170
laughing on stage.

2683
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:22,860
That's,

2684
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:24,000
that's real happiness.

2685
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:25,920
So is happiness possible?

2686
01:11:25,921 --> 01:11:26,430
Yeah.

2687
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:29,220
But you gotta be around a bunch of other
people that also commit to the same

2688
01:11:29,221 --> 01:11:29,910
ideas.

2689
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:31,830
You have to be around a
bunch of other really fun,

2690
01:11:31,831 --> 01:11:32,551
happy people.

2691
01:11:32,551 --> 01:11:34,890
It's very difficult to go it on your own.

2692
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:38,810
The only way you can is if somehow or
another you attract people as you're going

2693
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:42,690
on your own and you committed to a life
of happiness that also like kind of like

2694
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:47,130
catching into your vibe and then pick up
what you're doing and do the same thing

2695
01:11:47,131 --> 01:11:47,820
and then you,

2696
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:49,470
you gravitate more people.

2697
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:50,490
But you can do it.

2698
01:11:50,491 --> 01:11:53,580
And I don't think it has to be that
you have to be above happiness.

2699
01:11:53,581 --> 01:11:54,470
And it's like my,

2700
01:11:54,471 --> 01:11:56,100
my concept of guerrilla Buddhism,

2701
01:11:56,101 --> 01:11:56,851
I told you this before,

2702
01:11:56,851 --> 01:11:57,840
like people always say that,

2703
01:11:57,990 --> 01:11:58,321
you know,

2704
01:11:58,321 --> 01:11:58,650
uh,

2705
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:00,030
to be truly happy,

2706
01:12:00,031 --> 01:12:02,070
you cannot be attached
to objects and you know,

2707
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:02,520
yeah,

2708
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:03,330
you should be.

2709
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:05,430
You should transcend objects
and material possessions.

2710
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:07,110
I say horse shit.

2711
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:09,390
I say material possessions
are fucking awesome.

2712
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,840
Some cars are bad ass.

2713
01:12:10,841 --> 01:12:11,641
I'm the drive.

2714
01:12:11,641 --> 01:12:14,610
TV's are awesome to own
stereos or great to listen to,

2715
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:15,001
you know,

2716
01:12:15,001 --> 01:12:16,350
it's cool to eat a good meal.

2717
01:12:16,351 --> 01:12:18,570
It's nice to live in a house
that's cool to look at.

2718
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:18,870
You know,

2719
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:20,100
these are all good things.

2720
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:21,900
The problem is for most people,

2721
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:24,660
you become so attached to them because
they're so difficult to attain.

2722
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:28,770
So the true way of enlightenment isn't
to just be without any possessions.

2723
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:33,240
The true way is to get to a point where
you don't worry about the possessions,

2724
01:12:33,241 --> 01:12:34,710
but you appreciate them
when they're there.

2725
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:36,690
It's not that you become
completely attached to them,

2726
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:39,600
but the only way to really do that I
think is to make enough money so that it's

2727
01:12:39,601 --> 01:12:40,770
not that big a deal.

2728
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:42,000
If someone steals your car,

2729
01:12:42,030 --> 01:12:42,670
you can just get enough

2730
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:42,870
correct.

2731
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:43,670
The thing you,

2732
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:48,440
the thing people like about
possessions is not the possession.

2733
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:52,460
The thing people like is the way
the possession makes them feel.

2734
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:56,900
The feeling state that is
induced from the thing,

2735
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:57,390
right?

2736
01:12:57,390 --> 01:12:57,771
It's you know,

2737
01:12:57,771 --> 01:12:58,750
like so exam for,

2738
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:02,060
so people like feeling in
love and people like um,

2739
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:03,050
people,

2740
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:05,550
people at begin to associate the,

2741
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,100
the person in their wife,

2742
01:13:07,101 --> 01:13:07,641
the what I,

2743
01:13:07,641 --> 01:13:12,641
whoever they're dating or married to or
whatever is the thing that's invoking

2744
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:18,070
that love there attached to the aspect
of the material universe that's creating

2745
01:13:18,231 --> 01:13:19,064
the feeling.

2746
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:21,590
And I think that there's a place,

2747
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:24,500
and maybe it's a legendary and I'm,

2748
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,120
I shouldn't even believe in it,

2749
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:27,560
but a lot of,

2750
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:28,060
uh,

2751
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:28,881
a lot of the,

2752
01:13:28,881 --> 01:13:29,714
um,

2753
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:34,370
saints and a lot of gurus and a lot of
people who seem very advanced seem to

2754
01:13:34,371 --> 01:13:38,660
point to a place that is not dependent
on being triggered by things in the

2755
01:13:38,661 --> 01:13:39,470
material universe.

2756
01:13:39,470 --> 01:13:40,100
In other words,

2757
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:45,100
the feeling that you get from amazing
stuff is a preexisting feeling inside of

2758
01:13:45,291 --> 01:13:45,471
you.

2759
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:49,250
You already have that inside of you and
you're letting stuff be the excuse to

2760
01:13:49,251 --> 01:13:50,084
feel that way.

2761
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:55,330
Whereas the idea is you can pop into a
state where you're always experiencing

2762
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:59,840
that type of excitement and
pleasure that you've limited to.

2763
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:00,980
If I get a great job,

2764
01:14:00,981 --> 01:14:01,940
if I get a nice house,

2765
01:14:01,941 --> 01:14:04,160
if I book some other thing again,

2766
01:14:04,161 --> 01:14:05,210
or if I get a brand new car,

2767
01:14:05,211 --> 01:14:06,680
if I get the new Mac,

2768
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:08,000
I'll feel out.

2769
01:14:08,001 --> 01:14:08,960
I'm going to feel great.

2770
01:14:09,090 --> 01:14:09,300
That

2771
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:12,250
old Buddha quote enlightenment
as possible in this lifetime.

2772
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:13,180
Yes,

2773
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:14,740
that's exactly right.

2774
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:15,700
Can it be both?

2775
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:19,240
Can't you have a bad ass car
and still try to be enlightened?

2776
01:14:19,241 --> 01:14:20,074
Is that possible?

2777
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:20,290
Well,

2778
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:21,480
that's a thing that's either,

2779
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,331
I think there's something,

2780
01:14:22,331 --> 01:14:26,770
there's something negative about issuing
those things about about a week or two.

2781
01:14:26,771 --> 01:14:30,310
I think it's retarded because then you
get fucking people who are lying to

2782
01:14:30,311 --> 01:14:33,640
themselves in pretending to be a certain
way because that how many people drive

2783
01:14:33,641 --> 01:14:35,290
a Prius just for the social work

2784
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,430
and environmental is

2785
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:41,290
sweeter.

2786
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:43,380
I think a lot of people
buy just from the mileage.

2787
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:44,293
I'm down here.

2788
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:44,611
Yeah,

2789
01:14:44,611 --> 01:14:45,444
sure.

2790
01:14:46,410 --> 01:14:46,710
Yes.

2791
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:47,850
What Brad Pitt doesn't.

2792
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:48,410
Okay.

2793
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:49,111
No people.

2794
01:14:49,111 --> 01:14:49,944
Here's the thing.

2795
01:14:50,370 --> 01:14:51,203
People,

2796
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:51,840
people,

2797
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,220
people want to put off.

2798
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,313
Um,

2799
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:58,320
they want to put off meditating or
experimenting with different forms of

2800
01:14:58,321 --> 01:15:01,860
spirituality and tell they're good
until they feel like they're perfect.

2801
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:03,930
They want to approach their like,

2802
01:15:03,931 --> 01:15:04,231
you know,

2803
01:15:04,231 --> 01:15:05,340
I'm going to be happy soon,

2804
01:15:05,341 --> 01:15:07,080
but let me get rid of
this other shit first.

2805
01:15:07,081 --> 01:15:07,914
I got to take care of this.

2806
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,113
That's not it.

2807
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,070
The idea is you approach,

2808
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:11,701
uh,

2809
01:15:11,701 --> 01:15:15,450
understanding yourself and the universe
and your connection to the universe.

2810
01:15:15,451 --> 01:15:17,580
Not from a place where you
think you're going to be,

2811
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,500
but from where you are right now.

2812
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:19,810
Right.

2813
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:20,980
Some filthy,

2814
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:23,130
filthy you no matter what.

2815
01:15:23,131 --> 01:15:24,720
If you haven't really meditated a lot,

2816
01:15:24,721 --> 01:15:27,300
the chances are you're absorbed in some,

2817
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:28,141
if you're on earth,

2818
01:15:28,141 --> 01:15:30,270
you're absorbed in some really stupid,

2819
01:15:30,271 --> 01:15:31,170
crazy shit.

2820
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:34,650
And if you wait until you're better
balanced to start meditating,

2821
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:34,861
right,

2822
01:15:34,861 --> 01:15:36,270
you're never going to meditate.

2823
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:36,600
Right?

2824
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:40,500
You're never going to get into just
from exactly where you're at is,

2825
01:15:40,501 --> 01:15:40,910
uh,

2826
01:15:40,910 --> 01:15:41,180
as,

2827
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:41,510
uh,

2828
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:46,510
a fucking sex crazed beast or an alcoholic
or with seven heroin needles falling

2829
01:15:48,271 --> 01:15:49,104
out of your arm.

2830
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:50,880
Approach it from that place.

2831
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,890
And that's where you start
getting really core results,

2832
01:15:52,891 --> 01:15:53,061
Matt.

2833
01:15:53,061 --> 01:15:53,490
And when you,

2834
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:55,590
when you come at it from where
it's like everything else,

2835
01:15:55,591 --> 01:15:56,490
you just have to do it.

2836
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:56,821
It's like,

2837
01:15:56,821 --> 01:15:57,001
well,

2838
01:15:57,001 --> 01:15:58,440
I'm going to start exercising soon.

2839
01:15:58,441 --> 01:15:59,490
I'm going to quit smoking soon.

2840
01:15:59,520 --> 01:15:59,710
Yeah,

2841
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:00,543
we'll do this.

2842
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:01,620
Just start doing it.

2843
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:01,921
Yeah.

2844
01:16:01,921 --> 01:16:03,150
It's the same thing as everything else.

2845
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:07,530
Say you have to somehow or another
trigger that that action and your,

2846
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:10,620
your brain to force your body to move
in the direction of wherever the fuck it

2847
01:16:10,621 --> 01:16:11,260
is you need to do.

2848
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:11,650
Right.

2849
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:12,090
You know,

2850
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:13,710
hopefully we can hack
our brains in the future.

2851
01:16:13,711 --> 01:16:15,940
Where will we know
exactly what to do or to,

2852
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:16,250
to,

2853
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:17,880
to motivate [inaudible].

2854
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:20,290
I don't want to be the first though
because there's a bunch of dudes are going

2855
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:22,200
to turn gay because they
tried to get smarter

2856
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:25,950
because for sure that's
going to happen man.

2857
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:29,340
They're gonna fucking stab the wrong
part of your cortex and your just a yummy

2858
01:16:29,341 --> 01:16:30,174
cock.

2859
01:16:30,330 --> 01:16:31,800
Why does cop scene so yummy?

2860
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:36,630
Could you imagine you come to from
your operation and you're like,

2861
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:37,050
ah,

2862
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:37,830
just want to get it.

2863
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:37,981
Oh,

2864
01:16:37,981 --> 01:16:39,090
you look at the doctor.

2865
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:40,111
Damn,

2866
01:16:40,111 --> 01:16:40,944
he's hot.

2867
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:46,320
I kids stop saying what if like you could
live forever but for whatever reason,

2868
01:16:46,321 --> 01:16:48,030
like every couple of minutes
you just start going,

2869
01:16:48,031 --> 01:16:48,690
yummy cock,

2870
01:16:48,690 --> 01:16:49,523
show me.

2871
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:51,120
You can't even help it.

2872
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:52,080
You on a date,

2873
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:52,650
you know,

2874
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:53,520
having some of the,

2875
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:54,121
well,

2876
01:16:54,121 --> 01:16:54,720
you know,

2877
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,640
but really I been gone
to a few plays lately.

2878
01:16:56,641 --> 01:16:57,510
Yummy cock.

2879
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:58,020
Yeah.

2880
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:58,680
Just,

2881
01:16:58,680 --> 01:16:59,071
you know,

2882
01:16:59,071 --> 01:16:59,251
air,

2883
01:16:59,251 --> 01:17:00,180
you're in the interviews.

2884
01:17:00,181 --> 01:17:00,361
You know,

2885
01:17:00,361 --> 01:17:03,740
one of the great things about being
a mortal is just the Yummy Cox.

2886
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:07,440
He's a mortal,

2887
01:17:07,441 --> 01:17:09,530
but it's meant well.

2888
01:17:09,531 --> 01:17:10,190
I don't know man.

2889
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:12,980
I think it's easily possible that they
could fuck up the first couple of times.

2890
01:17:12,981 --> 01:17:15,670
I try to rewire the brain
and just create psychopaths.

2891
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:19,280
I love the idea of going to the gym and
putting my brain in the same place where

2892
01:17:19,281 --> 01:17:24,281
the kids play it while my body goes
and works out to be the fucking best.

2893
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:26,450
Do you think that if there was
a place where you could go,

2894
01:17:26,451 --> 01:17:31,451
where you could go and just lie down
in a machine and the body would be like

2895
01:17:32,361 --> 01:17:37,160
forced to do all this work without you
ever having to like exert effort mentally

2896
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:37,700
you would,

2897
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:38,690
you'd be down with that?

2898
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:40,093
Yeah,

2899
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:41,330
I do it.

2900
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:41,661
Yeah,

2901
01:17:41,661 --> 01:17:42,240
for sure.

2902
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,760
You would miss out the whole thing.

2903
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:46,030
The whole thing is developing the,

2904
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:49,400
the the character to push
through the hard workout,

2905
01:17:49,401 --> 01:17:54,401
which elevates your human potential or
starcraft while your body is working

2906
01:17:56,950 --> 01:17:58,010
at your body.

2907
01:17:58,010 --> 01:17:58,880
Did the hard part,

2908
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:01,850
but that's how you
develop character though.

2909
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:03,170
I mean that's a big way.

2910
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:04,221
There's,

2911
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:04,580
there's a,

2912
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:08,540
there's something that's definitely to
be learned from separating your body and

2913
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:11,210
your mind and forcing your
body to work for your mind.

2914
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:12,620
Or your body's struggling.

2915
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:13,970
Your body wants to quit and you go,

2916
01:18:13,971 --> 01:18:14,451
shut up,

2917
01:18:14,451 --> 01:18:14,810
bitch,

2918
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:15,643
keep going.

2919
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:16,341
And then when it's over,

2920
01:18:16,341 --> 01:18:16,611
you're like,

2921
01:18:16,611 --> 01:18:17,060
wow,

2922
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:17,511
I did it.

2923
01:18:17,511 --> 01:18:18,141
I got through it.

2924
01:18:18,141 --> 01:18:21,290
This is a tough struggle because when
you're doing like you ever do body weight

2925
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:21,950
squats,

2926
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:23,390
you know what they are Hindu squats.

2927
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,710
Ah Yeah.

2928
01:18:24,711 --> 01:18:26,060
I think I tried squats.

2929
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:28,010
Well it's very easy to do one,

2930
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:28,461
you know,

2931
01:18:28,461 --> 01:18:30,110
anybody can go down on your,

2932
01:18:30,111 --> 01:18:30,530
you know,

2933
01:18:30,530 --> 01:18:34,040
put to the your ass to the back of your
ankles and then stand back up again.

2934
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:34,850
It's not hard.

2935
01:18:34,850 --> 01:18:38,960
Very few people could do 500 and it's
one of those things when you start doing

2936
01:18:38,961 --> 01:18:39,200
it,

2937
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:39,441
you,

2938
01:18:39,441 --> 01:18:39,681
you,

2939
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:40,341
you get into it,

2940
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:42,260
you'd do like 25 and then you're like,

2941
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:43,340
Holy Shit,

2942
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,700
26 27 and the lactic burn,

2943
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:47,330
you know,

2944
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:47,490
the,

2945
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:50,000
the muscle burn your legs
towards getting pretty intense.

2946
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:52,070
But it's not a difficult thing to do.

2947
01:18:52,071 --> 01:18:53,750
It's not difficult to just stand up.

2948
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:56,510
So in your mind it's very hard
to accept that you should.

2949
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:57,650
When when she just stopped,

2950
01:18:57,651 --> 01:18:58,161
she just stopped.

2951
01:18:58,161 --> 01:19:00,890
Now I can't do another one
and you can't stand up.

2952
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,800
You really can't stand up one more
time just with your own body weight.

2953
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:09,010
So you have to like figure out how to
order your brain to work for you and push

2954
01:19:09,861 --> 01:19:14,510
through it and sometimes for like a couple
of minutes you'll be an agony taking

2955
01:19:14,511 --> 01:19:18,010
big deep breaths and then push out another
one and go down and dig deep resume.

2956
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:18,851
When do you want to quit?

2957
01:19:18,851 --> 01:19:21,800
What you want to quit it like 25 or
26 when it starts getting a little bit

2958
01:19:21,801 --> 01:19:22,600
difficult,

2959
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:23,361
your brain starts going,

2960
01:19:23,361 --> 01:19:23,601
all right,

2961
01:19:23,601 --> 01:19:24,050
let's stop.

2962
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:24,501
Let's stop,

2963
01:19:24,501 --> 01:19:25,130
let's stop.

2964
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:25,750
Your body's going,

2965
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:26,870
I'm sending you these signals.

2966
01:19:26,871 --> 01:19:27,920
This shit is not fun.

2967
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:28,671
Let's cut it off.

2968
01:19:28,671 --> 01:19:32,180
And then you have to figure out a way
to to manage that and balance that at

2969
01:19:32,181 --> 01:19:32,421
once.

2970
01:19:32,421 --> 01:19:33,200
You do.

2971
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:36,530
Once you do have the ability to push
yourself through brutal workouts,

2972
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:38,780
push yourself through like Jujitsu class,

2973
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:40,580
kickboxing class and stuff like that.

2974
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:41,080
When it's,

2975
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:41,350
when you,

2976
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:42,560
you've developed like character,

2977
01:19:42,561 --> 01:19:43,830
you develop something new,

2978
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:44,530
developed a,

2979
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:46,050
a control over your body.

2980
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,360
The average person doesn't have,

2981
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:48,080
yeah.

2982
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,460
Like those fucking guys who can do,

2983
01:19:49,461 --> 01:19:49,970
uh,

2984
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:50,330
those,

2985
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:51,350
those divers,

2986
01:19:51,610 --> 01:19:54,590
a free divers that I respect
the shit out of that.

2987
01:19:54,591 --> 01:19:55,670
I think it's a crazy thing,

2988
01:19:55,671 --> 01:19:57,860
but some of those guys who can
go into water for like seven.

2989
01:19:58,110 --> 01:19:59,330
That's crazy,

2990
01:19:59,331 --> 01:19:59,631
man.

2991
01:19:59,631 --> 01:20:01,370
That's one of my favorite things to watch.

2992
01:20:01,371 --> 01:20:01,600
Yeah.

2993
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,530
Like what the fuck?

2994
01:20:03,531 --> 01:20:08,531
How do you power over your body using
your mind and your willpower to control

2995
01:20:09,451 --> 01:20:10,080
your body?

2996
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:10,231
I mean,

2997
01:20:10,231 --> 01:20:10,561
it has to,

2998
01:20:10,561 --> 01:20:11,650
it takes a long time for them to,

2999
01:20:11,651 --> 01:20:12,570
to get up to that,

3000
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:13,950
that amount of your breath.

3001
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,080
But God made it perfect example.

3002
01:20:16,081 --> 01:20:19,710
Like every second you want to quit every
God damn second your body's sending

3003
01:20:19,711 --> 01:20:20,071
signals.

3004
01:20:20,071 --> 01:20:20,210
Okay.

3005
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:20,351
No,

3006
01:20:20,351 --> 01:20:20,731
for now,

3007
01:20:20,731 --> 01:20:21,600
for now it's a mirror.

3008
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:25,890
When I was in Hawaii stone out of
my mind from drinking pot tincture,

3009
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:30,930
we went snorkeling and there was our
group snorkeling and then I realized there

3010
01:20:30,931 --> 01:20:35,931
was a guy with a snorkel who wasn't in
our group and there's no boat anywhere to

3011
01:20:36,571 --> 01:20:37,081
be seen.

3012
01:20:37,081 --> 01:20:39,360
And like land is far the fuck away.

3013
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:41,820
And this guy swimming around
and like we're all snorkeling,

3014
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:46,440
he goes under and I'm watching him go way,

3015
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:46,861
way,

3016
01:20:46,861 --> 01:20:47,221
way,

3017
01:20:47,221 --> 01:20:47,581
way,

3018
01:20:47,581 --> 01:20:48,301
way down.

3019
01:20:48,301 --> 01:20:50,550
And he's staying down there and
he knows we're watching him.

3020
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:53,520
And he stayed down there
for an impossibly long time.

3021
01:20:53,521 --> 01:20:54,354
And I'm like,

3022
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:55,260
it went from me being like,

3023
01:20:55,261 --> 01:20:55,471
wow,

3024
01:20:55,471 --> 01:20:58,200
that guy is great until like my heart
started beating because I was like,

3025
01:20:58,260 --> 01:20:58,920
oh fuck,

3026
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,400
I think this guy is drowning.

3027
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,010
I think this guy's going to die.

3028
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,140
He turns over on his back,

3029
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:05,190
right.

3030
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:09,750
And his arms go out loose and limp
and his body starts floating up to the

3031
01:21:09,751 --> 01:21:10,584
surface.

3032
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:13,950
And then he just smiles and waves that
if he was faking drowning because he

3033
01:21:13,951 --> 01:21:15,480
could just hold his
breath so fucking long.

3034
01:21:15,481 --> 01:21:19,650
And I guess like one of the things he
liked to do in Hawaii was the snorkel out

3035
01:21:19,651 --> 01:21:22,290
to the groups and make
them maybe in drowned.

3036
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:23,640
Holy Shit.

3037
01:21:23,641 --> 01:21:26,420
So he practices his free
diving by freaking heat.

3038
01:21:26,730 --> 01:21:28,230
Cause I really thought he was,

3039
01:21:28,290 --> 01:21:28,671
he was,

3040
01:21:28,671 --> 01:21:28,920
it was,

3041
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,170
he was under so impossibly long.

3042
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,280
It was crazy.

3043
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:33,143
Whoa.

3044
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:34,410
Holy Shit.

3045
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:34,801
Yeah,

3046
01:21:34,801 --> 01:21:35,670
man like that.

3047
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:37,350
I would love to be able to do that.

3048
01:21:37,351 --> 01:21:38,730
That would be so amazing.

3049
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:40,470
That's pretty awesome man.

3050
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:44,960
You must have the most healthy
lungs to be able to do that.

3051
01:21:44,961 --> 01:21:47,280
That guy's probably never
even had secondhand smoke.

3052
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:48,050
I don't know.

3053
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:48,321
No,

3054
01:21:48,321 --> 01:21:49,880
I think it's something you build up to.

3055
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:51,680
I think it's something
just like everything else,

3056
01:21:51,681 --> 01:21:51,901
you know,

3057
01:21:51,901 --> 01:21:56,000
like the only way you can
do 500 bodyweight squats as
he got to start off at 25

3058
01:21:56,001 --> 01:21:59,320
and work your way up to 500 I think
they just developed the ability to,

3059
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:00,850
to hold their breath for,

3060
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:02,110
I know Egan Anyway,

3061
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:02,541
who is a,

3062
01:22:02,541 --> 01:22:03,020
uh,

3063
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:04,010
an MMA fighter.

3064
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,240
Him and his brother Ensign,

3065
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:07,300
they're pretty famous pioneers and uh,

3066
01:22:07,310 --> 01:22:07,791
his brother,

3067
01:22:07,791 --> 01:22:10,700
Egan is a famous for being a free diver.

3068
01:22:10,701 --> 01:22:13,730
I think he won like some sort
of crazy title and I'm like,

3069
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:17,630
I think at one point in time you'd like
held his breath the longest longer than

3070
01:22:17,631 --> 01:22:18,290
anybody else.

3071
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:18,430
Yeah,

3072
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:20,060
I'm pretty sure like navy seals and shit,

3073
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:21,320
a trainee to do that.

3074
01:22:21,321 --> 01:22:22,450
It's part of bootcamp.

3075
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:22,610
Right?

3076
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:23,570
Probably I would imagine.

3077
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:23,840
You know,

3078
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:24,111
dude,

3079
01:22:24,111 --> 01:22:25,670
I told you about my friend Eric,

3080
01:22:25,790 --> 01:22:26,031
Eric,

3081
01:22:26,031 --> 01:22:26,450
Chris,

3082
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:27,500
the guy who went to uh,

3083
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:27,800
he,

3084
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:28,101
he's a,

3085
01:22:28,101 --> 01:22:31,850
he's makes pool cues and makes his bad
ass pool cues and the military and he had

3086
01:22:31,851 --> 01:22:34,310
tried out for the seals and one
of the things they make you do,

3087
01:22:34,311 --> 01:22:35,130
I believe it was the seals.

3088
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:35,510
I might,

3089
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:37,370
what other might have been
one of the special forces.

3090
01:22:37,371 --> 01:22:41,790
What are the other other groups like
that they make you drown like you,

3091
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:44,890
you literally go underwater until
bubbles come up and then your,

3092
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,250
your team has to rescue you.

3093
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:49,010
So you have to trust in them
to bring you back to life.

3094
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,360
Fuck you go unconscious.

3095
01:22:50,361 --> 01:22:51,170
You drown.

3096
01:22:51,170 --> 01:22:53,120
They pull you out before
your body is totally dead.

3097
01:22:53,121 --> 01:22:54,260
They pumped the water out of you,

3098
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:56,390
they give you CPR and then
they bring you back to life.

3099
01:22:56,630 --> 01:22:57,530
And that's when he was like,

3100
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:58,370
I tap,

3101
01:22:58,370 --> 01:22:59,203
I'm done.

3102
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:00,200
Yes,

3103
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,300
I got to stay up for days and
go run it through the woods.

3104
01:23:02,301 --> 01:23:04,040
But I'm not gonna let you drown me.

3105
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:05,440
Have you seen that video on the Internet?

3106
01:23:05,441 --> 01:23:06,220
There's an video

3107
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:07,750
on the Internet of an artist doing that,

3108
01:23:07,751 --> 01:23:09,070
drowning himself in his bathtub.

3109
01:23:09,071 --> 01:23:09,904
Have you seen that?

3110
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:10,511
Yeah,

3111
01:23:10,511 --> 01:23:15,511
I him and brings him back to way he
puts up a fucking concrete block on his

3112
01:23:16,331 --> 01:23:19,390
chest and his bathtub drowns it cause,

3113
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:20,370
cause basically there's it,

3114
01:23:20,371 --> 01:23:21,700
when you suck in water,

3115
01:23:21,970 --> 01:23:22,900
there's a reaction.

3116
01:23:22,901 --> 01:23:26,180
I think your body as we're
automatically knocks you on conscious.

3117
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:27,011
So yeah,

3118
01:23:27,011 --> 01:23:29,890
he knew he would go out and his
friend had to resuscitate him.

3119
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:31,061
Oh my God.

3120
01:23:31,061 --> 01:23:31,930
Did you find it?

3121
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:32,390
No,

3122
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:36,160
I think look up performance
artists drown self and bathtub.

3123
01:23:36,610 --> 01:23:41,610
I guess like I'm telling you how to
Google or both internet junkies go to the

3124
01:23:41,711 --> 01:23:46,711
Google website and type prefer bing
me to drown the live performance art

3125
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:53,320
performance stunt talentless
self-indulgence taking the stage.

3126
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:54,440
This is,

3127
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:54,600
yeah,

3128
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:55,570
it piss people off.

3129
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:56,770
A lot of people were upset at them.

3130
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:58,210
Talentless right?

3131
01:23:58,270 --> 01:23:58,571
Yeah.

3132
01:23:58,571 --> 01:23:59,111
Well maybe,

3133
01:23:59,111 --> 01:24:00,970
but no one's saying that
it's a talent thing.

3134
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:01,833
Yeah.

3135
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:03,040
It's a crazy balls.

3136
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:04,870
Really good at drowning myself.

3137
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:08,890
I was born with this bizarre talent
where I can drown myself in anything.

3138
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:11,560
This fucking won't do.

3139
01:24:11,561 --> 01:24:12,640
Website doesn't work.

3140
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:13,151
Yeah.

3141
01:24:13,151 --> 01:24:13,600
I don't,

3142
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,610
it was like on a weird site where I saw,

3143
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:16,630
I can't remember.

3144
01:24:16,631 --> 01:24:19,000
I think that was when I
still use the gap junction.

3145
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:21,220
Crazy idiot drowns himself for arc.

3146
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:22,820
That's funny.

3147
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:27,820
That was the first one was like a critique
of it and this one is a crazy idiot.

3148
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:31,170
Only sites are fucking wanky this way.

3149
01:24:31,171 --> 01:24:33,010
It work in either cause it was streaming,

3150
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:33,730
uh,

3151
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:34,563
uh,

3152
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:35,940
really.

3153
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:36,640
You know,

3154
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:37,091
come on man.

3155
01:24:37,091 --> 01:24:38,080
We got cable here.

3156
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:39,220
That's not what this is.

3157
01:24:39,221 --> 01:24:39,640
It's not,

3158
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:41,200
the sites are coming up instantly.

3159
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:42,161
It's not what it is.

3160
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:45,260
It's like the Internet
just sucks my websites.

3161
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:48,190
It doesn't matter if
what your download speed,

3162
01:24:48,191 --> 01:24:48,940
it's the,

3163
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:51,330
your upload speeds
product bottleneck neck.

3164
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:52,173
That something like,

3165
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:52,781
Brian,

3166
01:24:52,781 --> 01:24:53,800
I've got a question for you.

3167
01:24:53,801 --> 01:24:54,460
This is a,

3168
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:55,110
I've got an,

3169
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:57,820
I've got a tech technological question.

3170
01:24:58,330 --> 01:25:01,240
Why does Korea have
faster Internet than us?

3171
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,433
Most countries,

3172
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:06,670
most countries have faster internet
to know why we're just behind,

3173
01:25:06,730 --> 01:25:07,150
you know,

3174
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:10,270
we're kicking ass and making freedom bro.

3175
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:12,130
That shit just gets left behind.

3176
01:25:12,131 --> 01:25:13,450
Reason why there's cell phones,

3177
01:25:13,451 --> 01:25:13,901
you know,

3178
01:25:13,901 --> 01:25:15,270
are there video games ever?

3179
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:16,090
Here it is.

3180
01:25:16,090 --> 01:25:16,923
Here's homeboy.

3181
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:20,140
If you just look up a
drowning performance art,

3182
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:21,760
go look at it up on Youtube.

3183
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:24,330
I'm going to watch it real
quick and see if it's worth.

3184
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:25,203
How can you not say,

3185
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:26,591
oh,

3186
01:25:26,591 --> 01:25:27,460
he talks about it.

3187
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:28,090
Okay,

3188
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:28,331
go.

3189
01:25:28,331 --> 01:25:29,230
Go to it Brian,

3190
01:25:29,510 --> 01:25:32,350
because this guy is actually going to
explain what the fuck is going to do

3191
01:25:32,351 --> 01:25:33,184
before

3192
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:34,721
I want to,

3193
01:25:34,721 --> 01:25:36,430
how many views it has on Youtube?

3194
01:25:36,610 --> 01:25:37,090
How many,

3195
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:39,250
let's guess I say 35 times.

3196
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:44,050
I want to know what advertisements
come you say I say 35,000 how many?

3197
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:49,140
I got to put that in 100,000 a hundred
thousand let's say 27,000 shit,

3198
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:50,100
really?

3199
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:50,240
You?

3200
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:53,170
You overestimate the Justin
Bieber fans of the world,

3201
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:56,681
but then again,

3202
01:25:56,681 --> 01:25:56,921
you know,

3203
01:25:56,921 --> 01:25:57,131
look,

3204
01:25:57,131 --> 01:25:59,110
Justin Bieber's at least
seeing a fucking song,

3205
01:26:00,110 --> 01:26:04,330
bathtub and beaver is the soundtrack to
a guy drowning himself in the bathtub.

3206
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:05,960
It will quadruple the views.

3207
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:06,261
You know,

3208
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:08,240
I don't know what Justin
Bieber sounds like.

3209
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:12,970
I have no idea what a Justin Bieber
signing angel is that in Brian when a

3210
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:13,640
commercial for it?

3211
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:14,480
No one has a commercial.

3212
01:26:14,481 --> 01:26:14,711
This one.

3213
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:15,381
What commercial?

3214
01:26:15,381 --> 01:26:15,630
What?

3215
01:26:15,630 --> 01:26:18,020
What product are they selling
with this guy's drowning video.

3216
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:18,950
Starcraft.

3217
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:19,920
It looks like no,

3218
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:21,410
some kind of a video game.

3219
01:26:21,990 --> 01:26:22,790
Yeah.

3220
01:26:22,790 --> 01:26:23,623
Weird.

3221
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:24,531
Hey,

3222
01:26:24,531 --> 01:26:25,460
Louis starcraft.

3223
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:26,781
I did a,

3224
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:28,970
another podcast on a
plane with Articia fear.

3225
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:29,211
Oh,

3226
01:26:29,211 --> 01:26:30,044
how'd it go?

3227
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:31,230
We were blitzkrieg.

3228
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:34,280
We ate an edible before we
got on the plane and we were,

3229
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:34,911
dude,

3230
01:26:34,911 --> 01:26:36,230
we were gone like scary.

3231
01:26:36,231 --> 01:26:36,860
Gone.

3232
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:37,640
Like I was like,

3233
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:40,700
it was like my whole body was
like tingling with vulnerability,

3234
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:41,380
you know,

3235
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:45,590
you get to that fits that state that
you're still taking care of and a plane.

3236
01:26:45,591 --> 01:26:47,090
It's the perfect place to do it.

3237
01:26:47,091 --> 01:26:49,700
Like until you freak out and
you can't get off the plane.

3238
01:26:49,701 --> 01:26:51,530
Last time he was on a plane and did it,

3239
01:26:51,531 --> 01:26:53,690
he almost had to tell the stewardess that,

3240
01:26:53,691 --> 01:26:54,021
hey,

3241
01:26:54,021 --> 01:26:54,880
I need to get out.

3242
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:58,160
That's a bit of exaggeration
because he was on,

3243
01:26:58,190 --> 01:26:59,240
this is the time he was with me.

3244
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:00,051
He,

3245
01:27:00,051 --> 01:27:00,410
uh,

3246
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:00,751
he,

3247
01:27:00,751 --> 01:27:01,460
he said,

3248
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:02,041
oh mom,

3249
01:27:02,041 --> 01:27:03,200
I almost had to get off the plane.

3250
01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:03,711
And I was like,

3251
01:27:03,711 --> 01:27:04,320
really?

3252
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:05,061
Not really.

3253
01:27:05,061 --> 01:27:06,380
It was just a thought in his head,

3254
01:27:06,381 --> 01:27:08,120
but he never really actually did it.

3255
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:11,150
Like you press the stewardess button
and ask if they would mind landing the

3256
01:27:11,151 --> 01:27:11,791
plane for him.

3257
01:27:11,791 --> 01:27:12,970
Landing and Phoenix really quick,

3258
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:13,910
Kinda to run,

3259
01:27:15,850 --> 01:27:17,660
run out into the desert and fun of myself

3260
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:20,890
are,

3261
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:21,340
are,

3262
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:22,080
he goes deep

3263
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:25,910
because I'd like to introduce myself
and did she start off and Murphy Look,

3264
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,030
performance artist,

3265
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:28,560
I hate them already.

3266
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:33,540
My work is heavily influenced by Chris
Burden's performance art from the 70s.

3267
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:34,981
Uh,

3268
01:27:34,981 --> 01:27:39,720
he's the artists most famous for his
piece shoot in which he had his friend

3269
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:42,090
shoot him in the arm
with a 22 caliber rifle.

3270
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:48,140
That was a wonderful people you're
about to see is a piece of mine entitled

3271
01:27:48,210 --> 01:27:49,043
drowning.

3272
01:27:51,450 --> 01:27:55,020
I feel that this piece requires
a little bit of explanation.

3273
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:55,983
Hmm.

3274
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:59,720
When water enters the airway,

3275
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:05,240
the vocal cords constrict
and seal off the air tube,

3276
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:08,270
thus preventing any water
from entering the lungs.

3277
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:10,250
This is called a leg,

3278
01:28:10,251 --> 01:28:11,084
no spasm.

3279
01:28:12,850 --> 01:28:14,740
During this initial phase of drowning,

3280
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:16,660
very little water,

3281
01:28:16,661 --> 01:28:19,000
if any actually enters the lungs,

3282
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:20,950
it actually fills up the stomach.

3283
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:23,203
MMM.

3284
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:29,290
My hands were bound and a concrete
block was placed on my chest.

3285
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:30,280
Uh,

3286
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:31,900
this was done in order to weigh me down,

3287
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:35,080
but it also would help
force air out of my lungs.

3288
01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:36,820
Or once I lost breath,

3289
01:28:38,070 --> 01:28:38,980
you'll see that uh,

3290
01:28:39,010 --> 01:28:42,190
nose clips were used as
well in our to ensure safety

3291
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,630
attracted to your fucking
drowning yourself.

3292
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:50,820
Wait for me to go unconscious and then
immediately pull me out of the water that

3293
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:52,600
in Cox it sounds so.

3294
01:28:53,470 --> 01:28:54,730
I think that's pretty much it.

3295
01:28:56,050 --> 01:28:57,010
Let's watch

3296
01:28:58,020 --> 01:28:58,430
like how,

3297
01:28:58,430 --> 01:29:01,640
how many minutes did his friend think
about not picking up that block?

3298
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:04,540
I wonder how long you went under four.

3299
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:07,530
And so this guy's in his
underwear is now of course.

3300
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:08,790
That's a bitch ass move.

3301
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:09,721
If you're going to drown,

3302
01:29:09,721 --> 01:29:10,770
you should be balls out.

3303
01:29:11,790 --> 01:29:13,410
Fucking let your cock hang outs on.

3304
01:29:13,411 --> 01:29:14,244
Get Yourself.

3305
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:15,691
Come on,

3306
01:29:15,691 --> 01:29:16,260
man.

3307
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:19,530
You're afraid we're going to see your
penis while you're drowning and now you're

3308
01:29:19,531 --> 01:29:21,090
showing us your ass there Sonny boy,

3309
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:24,420
you're dying in a tub and you're
worried about people seeing your penis.

3310
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:25,740
You fucking pussy

3311
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:31,320
fucking fake crazy person was
a cinder block on his chest.

3312
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:31,981
By the way.

3313
01:29:31,981 --> 01:29:33,900
That cinder block ain't
stopping me from drowning.

3314
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:34,141
Bitch.

3315
01:29:34,141 --> 01:29:35,220
I'll stand right the fuck up.

3316
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:37,770
Is that real dumb?

3317
01:29:39,090 --> 01:29:41,670
So he's this guy just going to start
breathing now what happens here?

3318
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:49,830
And he's just laying there with
a cinder block on his chest

3319
01:29:52,690 --> 01:29:54,400
that's somehow somewhere around the,

3320
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:59,430
I guess he's going to like take a breath
of water in a half to get here and you

3321
01:29:59,751 --> 01:30:00,670
won't be able to get out.

3322
01:30:00,671 --> 01:30:02,800
So he's just holding his breath
right now as long as we can.

3323
01:30:03,970 --> 01:30:06,370
So what the fuck happened to this
guy while we're going through this?

3324
01:30:06,371 --> 01:30:07,390
Because it's probably
going to take a minute.

3325
01:30:07,391 --> 01:30:08,710
What the fuck happened in this guy?

3326
01:30:08,890 --> 01:30:10,380
That he wants to drown himself in a tunnel

3327
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:13,990
that affected way he talks.

3328
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,430
Makes me want to kick him in the balls,

3329
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:16,091
doesn't it?

3330
01:30:16,091 --> 01:30:16,781
For the arts.

3331
01:30:16,781 --> 01:30:21,781
Joe Work is heavily influenced by
another Douche bag from the 70s he shot

3332
01:30:21,971 --> 01:30:22,940
himself in the arm.

3333
01:30:23,370 --> 01:30:24,610
It was amazing piece.

3334
01:30:24,611 --> 01:30:25,910
His piece called shoot me.

3335
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:30,880
This is combat of is called
the most unoriginal names.

3336
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,290
This is called Johnny.

3337
01:30:32,770 --> 01:30:33,061
Well,

3338
01:30:33,061 --> 01:30:34,030
I mean that's what it is.

3339
01:30:34,031 --> 01:30:35,050
Why call it anything else?

3340
01:30:35,051 --> 01:30:35,650
Right.

3341
01:30:35,650 --> 01:30:38,560
Fucking put some icing on it
and come up with something.

3342
01:30:38,710 --> 01:30:39,543
I don't know man.

3343
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:40,541
He stay still.

3344
01:30:40,541 --> 01:30:42,370
So while we're pausing folks,

3345
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,320
this guy is still just
lying there in the tub,

3346
01:30:44,321 --> 01:30:45,850
holding his breath with his eyes open.

3347
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:46,120
Yeah,

3348
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:49,540
he hasn't given up yet and
he's getting ready to give up.

3349
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:53,230
He starting to spouse cause this
is towards the end of the video.

3350
01:30:53,231 --> 01:30:53,450
The,

3351
01:30:53,450 --> 01:30:56,260
the beautiful thing about youtube is you
could see that little bar at the bottom

3352
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:56,981
there.

3353
01:30:56,981 --> 01:30:57,814
He goes,

3354
01:30:58,210 --> 01:30:58,721
there he goes,

3355
01:30:58,721 --> 01:30:59,350
he's,

3356
01:30:59,350 --> 01:31:00,183
he's breathing now.

3357
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:03,170
Oh this is fuck.

3358
01:31:04,810 --> 01:31:05,643
Oh my God.

3359
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:26,220
Because they got him on the floor
now and now they're doing CPR.

3360
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:28,723
Okay.

3361
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:36,730
Oh this is so fucked.

3362
01:31:36,731 --> 01:31:39,220
The guy's blowing in his mouth
right now and he's still not back.

3363
01:31:39,670 --> 01:31:40,600
He's still done.

3364
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:46,720
I guess his guy,

3365
01:31:46,810 --> 01:31:49,270
hopefully this guy really
knows how to do CPR.

3366
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:50,870
Right?

3367
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:51,520
Guys,

3368
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:52,600
last couple of years ago,

3369
01:31:52,610 --> 01:31:55,460
ever done this to a live body
before you want to show hill.

3370
01:31:55,490 --> 01:31:57,520
It spans lifeguard type character.

3371
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:01,910
This is scary shit.

3372
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:03,080
Okay.

3373
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:04,250
He still is counting.

3374
01:32:04,251 --> 01:32:06,380
He's looking up and counting
and I'm blowing into this guys.

3375
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:09,620
I don't see a lot of effort on his
party that don't say I'm really fucking

3376
01:32:09,710 --> 01:32:10,720
passionate in that area.

3377
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:12,710
This is fuck man,

3378
01:32:12,711 --> 01:32:17,711
this guy is still under or dead or drowned
or is it brain cells dying right now?

3379
01:32:18,230 --> 01:32:18,670
Isn't,

3380
01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:19,503
isn't this,

3381
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,840
how many minutes does it have to be?

3382
01:32:20,841 --> 01:32:23,930
Because it hasn't been that many
minutes is the guy was under that

3383
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,353
it.

3384
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:28,721
Yeah.

3385
01:32:28,721 --> 01:32:31,410
What if they did it and they're both
assisted at sound that you heard this,

3386
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:33,130
his friend running back into the room.

3387
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:34,173
Right?

3388
01:32:38,110 --> 01:32:38,943
Whoa.

3389
01:32:40,490 --> 01:32:41,323
Wow.

3390
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:42,560
And now he's back to life.

3391
01:32:43,490 --> 01:32:44,323
Shit.

3392
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:46,280
Holy Shit.

3393
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:49,290
What the fuck man,

3394
01:32:49,670 --> 01:32:51,500
that took a long ass time.

3395
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,360
Holy Fuck.

3396
01:32:59,460 --> 01:32:59,880
Yeah.

3397
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:02,610
It's pretty fucked up to that is a trip.

3398
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:06,731
Let's see at the end,

3399
01:33:06,731 --> 01:33:08,220
Brian and see if he's
got something stupid.

3400
01:33:08,230 --> 01:33:10,240
Say I'm like,

3401
01:33:10,330 --> 01:33:12,010
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.

3402
01:33:12,610 --> 01:33:13,810
Don't try this at home.

3403
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:16,953
Wow.

3404
01:33:18,190 --> 01:33:20,380
We are all fascinated by that transition,

3405
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:21,040
you know,

3406
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:21,940
from here to there.

3407
01:33:22,570 --> 01:33:23,890
From present to not,

3408
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:24,460
yeah.

3409
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:25,570
From life to death.

3410
01:33:25,571 --> 01:33:26,140
From,

3411
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:26,530
yeah.

3412
01:33:26,530 --> 01:33:27,700
From here to gone.

3413
01:33:27,790 --> 01:33:28,360
You know,

3414
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:29,650
we're all fascinated by that man.

3415
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:30,820
The death of the body.

3416
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:32,290
How often do you trip about that?

3417
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:34,510
Dying a looker I got for you,

3418
01:33:34,511 --> 01:33:34,901
by the way.

3419
01:33:34,901 --> 01:33:35,740
Do you keep forgetting?

3420
01:33:35,890 --> 01:33:38,590
I got your notebook that you
left here when you lived here.

3421
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:40,360
We're not going to read from that.

3422
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,130
He Joe's already read through it.

3423
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:43,320
I heard about the weight.

3424
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:45,790
You have to say about ponies.

3425
01:33:47,350 --> 01:33:48,530
Thanks and love this thing.

3426
01:33:48,531 --> 01:33:50,110
It's been burning a hole through my check.

3427
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:53,080
You're just lucky that
you didn't become famous.

3428
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:58,110
You lucky he didn't become famous in
the time between a living here and going

3429
01:33:58,571 --> 01:34:02,080
out on your own because I would've sold
that fucking thing if you were Charlie

3430
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:02,081
Sheen.

3431
01:34:02,081 --> 01:34:03,280
I'd be on the today show right now.

3432
01:34:03,281 --> 01:34:06,910
I have the document that is a true
friend to give this embarrassing journal

3433
01:34:06,911 --> 01:34:07,241
back.

3434
01:34:07,241 --> 01:34:07,331
Well,

3435
01:34:07,331 --> 01:34:11,380
this is the journal that Duncan Duncan
got the boot from his missus back in the

3436
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:12,070
day and uh,

3437
01:34:12,070 --> 01:34:13,330
live with me for a few months.

3438
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:14,980
Best roommate ever by the way,

3439
01:34:15,010 --> 01:34:16,030
the only one that's ever cleaned.

3440
01:34:16,031 --> 01:34:17,170
I've got a couple of guys live with me.

3441
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:21,880
No one that ever like actually kept his
room clean as Dunkin Tate live with me

3442
01:34:21,881 --> 01:34:22,740
for a few months and was like,

3443
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:23,860
goddamn tornado in there.

3444
01:34:23,861 --> 01:34:24,110
I was,

3445
01:34:24,110 --> 01:34:25,840
it takes a fucking savage tape.

3446
01:34:25,841 --> 01:34:26,231
Might as well.

3447
01:34:26,231 --> 01:34:28,020
I just might as well
just cut a hole in the,

3448
01:34:28,021 --> 01:34:28,960
in the side of the hill.

3449
01:34:28,961 --> 01:34:32,680
And Tate would've lived in there
just to say game Tate's crazy.

3450
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:33,693
But um,

3451
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:34,121
anyway,

3452
01:34:34,121 --> 01:34:34,870
Dunkin wrote this,

3453
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:37,720
a journal about his feelings in the
relationship and the reason why I brought

3454
01:34:37,721 --> 01:34:38,021
this up,

3455
01:34:38,021 --> 01:34:42,340
the reason why my mind even went to it
in the first place is because a lot of

3456
01:34:42,341 --> 01:34:45,660
people are scared or the isolation tank
for the same reason they're scared to

3457
01:34:45,661 --> 01:34:46,140
death,

3458
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:46,420
right?

3459
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:48,730
Because it almost is like
a personal death of you.

3460
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:49,031
You know,

3461
01:34:49,031 --> 01:34:51,910
like a temporary death of
you for a brief moment.

3462
01:34:51,930 --> 01:34:52,050
You,

3463
01:34:52,050 --> 01:34:53,860
you cease to exist when you go into that,

3464
01:34:53,861 --> 01:34:54,694
that tank,

3465
01:34:54,910 --> 01:34:57,800
that tank is also
something that helps you.

3466
01:34:57,801 --> 01:34:59,750
And this is where the connection
to this journal comes from.

3467
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:00,260
Juan,

3468
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:01,580
you were going through this breakup.

3469
01:35:01,581 --> 01:35:03,410
You kind of reassessed your whole life.

3470
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:05,060
It was really interesting to watch.

3471
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:05,421
You know,

3472
01:35:05,421 --> 01:35:05,900
you,

3473
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:10,430
you came when you called me up and you
were really bummed out and she kicked you

3474
01:35:10,431 --> 01:35:12,680
out and you were in a
hotel room and I'm like,

3475
01:35:12,681 --> 01:35:12,871
Hey,

3476
01:35:12,871 --> 01:35:14,000
you fucking come live with me.

3477
01:35:14,001 --> 01:35:15,060
And then you moved and you were like,

3478
01:35:15,061 --> 01:35:16,300
just a little frazzled.

3479
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:16,641
You were like,

3480
01:35:16,641 --> 01:35:17,030
yeah,

3481
01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:17,751
thanks a lot man.

3482
01:35:17,751 --> 01:35:18,411
I really appreciate it.

3483
01:35:18,411 --> 01:35:18,591
I'm like,

3484
01:35:18,591 --> 01:35:18,801
Hey,

3485
01:35:18,801 --> 01:35:19,551
I'm living by myself.

3486
01:35:19,551 --> 01:35:20,121
This is all good.

3487
01:35:20,121 --> 01:35:20,331
You know,

3488
01:35:20,331 --> 01:35:21,170
Dunkin's live with me now.

3489
01:35:21,171 --> 01:35:22,004
We're going to have some fun.

3490
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:22,701
It's been a pretty dude.

3491
01:35:22,701 --> 01:35:23,540
Everything's going to be fine.

3492
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:26,720
But you were clearly like lost,

3493
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:27,081
you know,

3494
01:35:27,081 --> 01:35:27,250
you,

3495
01:35:27,250 --> 01:35:27,481
you,

3496
01:35:27,481 --> 01:35:28,400
you would like gotten,

3497
01:35:28,430 --> 01:35:28,601
you know,

3498
01:35:28,601 --> 01:35:30,050
when you get dumped man,

3499
01:35:30,051 --> 01:35:32,570
it's like just fucking feeling of shit.

3500
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,090
I don't have a home anymore.

3501
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:34,520
Yeah.

3502
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:35,930
Like where am I sleeping?

3503
01:35:35,931 --> 01:35:36,290
Yeah.

3504
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:36,921
Massive.

3505
01:35:36,921 --> 01:35:39,950
Like just towards your
junction change complete.

3506
01:35:40,130 --> 01:35:42,770
You've been living this
certain way along enough to,

3507
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,850
to get used to it and then all of a
sudden everything absolutely changes.

3508
01:35:46,851 --> 01:35:51,851
Like just a huge tour turn that
you probably thought could happen,

3509
01:35:52,761 --> 01:35:53,240
but you're,

3510
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:53,780
you know,

3511
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:56,210
trying to imagine that it
wasn't even a possibility.

3512
01:35:56,211 --> 01:35:57,080
And it happens.

3513
01:35:57,470 --> 01:35:57,861
Well that,

3514
01:35:57,861 --> 01:35:58,221
yeah,

3515
01:35:58,221 --> 01:35:58,880
that's like,

3516
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:00,050
you go into shock,

3517
01:36:00,230 --> 01:36:02,870
you're attached to a certain rhythm,

3518
01:36:02,871 --> 01:36:04,130
a certain pattern,

3519
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:07,800
a certain set of surroundings
that massively changes you.

3520
01:36:07,801 --> 01:36:11,750
You go into shock and that is the perfect
time to get in a fucking flotation

3521
01:36:11,751 --> 01:36:15,190
tank when everything's discombobulated
and floating around inside of you and all

3522
01:36:15,191 --> 01:36:15,640
the,

3523
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:16,380
all the,

3524
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:16,680
uh,

3525
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:18,890
weird assemblage of emotions.

3526
01:36:18,891 --> 01:36:20,720
And more than anything though,

3527
01:36:20,721 --> 01:36:23,480
what's cool about that shit is
you get a real taste of truth.

3528
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:25,700
Like that's what truth is right there.

3529
01:36:25,701 --> 01:36:27,980
That's like the experience of truth,

3530
01:36:27,981 --> 01:36:28,970
which is change,

3531
01:36:28,971 --> 01:36:30,560
which is dramatic,

3532
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,630
radical change.

3533
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:34,880
Fucking unavoidable happens all the time.

3534
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:35,331
Did the,

3535
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:39,520
the isolation tank keeps you
from distracting yourself
and makes you think about

3536
01:36:39,521 --> 01:36:40,310
your life?

3537
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:40,530
Yeah.

3538
01:36:40,530 --> 01:36:41,830
It makes you think about what's going on.

3539
01:36:42,010 --> 01:36:43,390
So for me,

3540
01:36:43,391 --> 01:36:48,391
it was so fascinating having you here at
a real low point and watching you pull

3541
01:36:49,361 --> 01:36:51,340
right out of it right out of it,

3542
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:52,630
like very quickly.

3543
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:53,381
Like you,

3544
01:36:53,381 --> 01:36:55,450
when you got into that tank
and within a few weeks,

3545
01:36:55,451 --> 01:36:55,990
Matt,

3546
01:36:55,990 --> 01:36:58,300
you were laughing about shit
and joking around about it.

3547
01:36:58,350 --> 01:36:58,590
Sure.

3548
01:36:58,590 --> 01:36:59,423
Yeah.

3549
01:36:59,430 --> 01:36:59,731
Yeah.

3550
01:36:59,731 --> 01:37:00,510
They always cool.

3551
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:01,000
It was.

3552
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:01,411
Yeah,

3553
01:37:01,411 --> 01:37:02,670
it definitely,

3554
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:03,900
definitely helps.

3555
01:37:03,901 --> 01:37:05,220
And that's why you're this,

3556
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:06,590
my friends are so important.

3557
01:37:06,591 --> 01:37:11,591
Cause like if you don't have friends
and you get into that predicament oh

3558
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:14,311
terrible.

3559
01:37:14,311 --> 01:37:16,560
It's the worst feeling
it feel completely alone.

3560
01:37:16,590 --> 01:37:17,101
Yeah.

3561
01:37:17,101 --> 01:37:17,521
Yeah.

3562
01:37:17,521 --> 01:37:17,790
And,

3563
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:18,930
but you know,

3564
01:37:18,931 --> 01:37:19,980
even if you don't have friends,

3565
01:37:19,981 --> 01:37:21,960
you can still pull yourself out of it,

3566
01:37:21,961 --> 01:37:24,740
but you have to I guess really want,

3567
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:25,091
you know,

3568
01:37:25,091 --> 01:37:25,370
you,

3569
01:37:25,370 --> 01:37:26,580
you have to want to,

3570
01:37:26,850 --> 01:37:27,540
yeah.

3571
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:28,350
Yeah.

3572
01:37:28,350 --> 01:37:28,801
Well it's,

3573
01:37:28,801 --> 01:37:29,070
it's,

3574
01:37:29,070 --> 01:37:29,551
I mean it's,

3575
01:37:29,551 --> 01:37:29,761
look,

3576
01:37:29,761 --> 01:37:33,000
anyone can can improve their surroundings
so you can improve your situation.

3577
01:37:33,030 --> 01:37:37,470
But it was really interesting
for me watching you because
it was such an unusual

3578
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:39,720
opportunity for both of us.

3579
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:42,990
It was an unusual opportunity for me to
watch someone who didn't have a lot of

3580
01:37:42,991 --> 01:37:44,100
experience with a tank,

3581
01:37:44,130 --> 01:37:49,130
but who was such a curious person and
psychedelically experienced like you and

3582
01:37:49,171 --> 01:37:50,820
then have access to this thing on a,

3583
01:37:50,821 --> 01:37:51,990
on a daily basis,

3584
01:37:52,350 --> 01:37:52,681
you know?

3585
01:37:52,681 --> 01:37:56,040
And for me to watch you
go from this really low

3586
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:56,910
point to like,

3587
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:59,250
like really like gaining ground.

3588
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,290
Like you came out of it like stronger

3589
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:04,650
fucking cool climbing out of that thing.

3590
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:07,110
In that state of being in the,

3591
01:38:07,111 --> 01:38:09,420
in the state of like having had,

3592
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:10,470
because you know,

3593
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:14,040
their second psychedelics
are not limited to drugs.

3594
01:38:14,170 --> 01:38:14,540
There,

3595
01:38:14,540 --> 01:38:17,610
there's many ways to induce
a psychedelic state of mind.

3596
01:38:17,910 --> 01:38:19,110
The tank being one of them.

3597
01:38:19,111 --> 01:38:20,580
And um,

3598
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:25,050
another way to induce a psychedelic
state of mind is to have dramatic change

3599
01:38:25,051 --> 01:38:30,051
happen in your life that
rips back whatever delusion
you are living by and shows

3600
01:38:30,721 --> 01:38:31,510
you

3601
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:32,770
the true universe.

3602
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:33,130
Yeah.

3603
01:38:33,130 --> 01:38:37,270
People turn the term psychedelic to a
lot of people means like seeing things

3604
01:38:37,271 --> 01:38:39,100
that aren't their hallucinations,

3605
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,210
dancing mice,

3606
01:38:40,211 --> 01:38:40,421
you know,

3607
01:38:40,421 --> 01:38:41,081
Shit like that.

3608
01:38:41,081 --> 01:38:42,700
Pink elephants flying in the sky.

3609
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,980
That's not a real psychedelic state.

3610
01:38:45,130 --> 01:38:50,130
The real psychedelic state is
the dissolution of cultural
conformity and the Ah,

3611
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:52,150
your ideas of the universe,

3612
01:38:52,270 --> 01:38:55,270
all your predetermined
patterns of thinking all your,

3613
01:38:55,390 --> 01:38:57,310
you're adopted behavior patterns,

3614
01:38:57,311 --> 01:39:00,970
all that gets stripped away and you're
left with the core of you and your

3615
01:39:00,971 --> 01:39:01,870
decisions and,

3616
01:39:02,110 --> 01:39:02,711
and what,

3617
01:39:02,711 --> 01:39:04,270
what you can and can't change.

3618
01:39:04,450 --> 01:39:07,990
And how you led yourself into a position
where you were so weak in the first

3619
01:39:07,991 --> 01:39:08,561
place that you,

3620
01:39:08,561 --> 01:39:08,710
you know,

3621
01:39:08,710 --> 01:39:10,390
you needed saving from.

3622
01:39:10,540 --> 01:39:11,250
Like what?

3623
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:11,891
What were,

3624
01:39:11,891 --> 01:39:13,480
why did you have no foundation?

3625
01:39:13,481 --> 01:39:14,311
Why did you fall apart?

3626
01:39:14,311 --> 01:39:14,890
Like when,

3627
01:39:14,890 --> 01:39:15,910
what is it about,

3628
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:16,270
you know,

3629
01:39:16,270 --> 01:39:19,660
life and about trying to get by in
this world that leaves us so fucking

3630
01:39:19,661 --> 01:39:24,520
vulnerable sometimes and so in need of
other human beings is to stack us up and

3631
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:28,720
to hold us up and watching you
man was really fucking cool.

3632
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:30,430
It was really cool because
you really used it,

3633
01:39:30,431 --> 01:39:30,611
man.

3634
01:39:30,611 --> 01:39:31,660
You got in there all the time,

3635
01:39:31,810 --> 01:39:32,141
you know,

3636
01:39:32,141 --> 01:39:32,501
and you were,

3637
01:39:32,501 --> 01:39:34,750
you were getting out and
talking about it and it was,

3638
01:39:34,751 --> 01:39:35,680
it was a fucking trip,

3639
01:39:35,681 --> 01:39:35,831
you know?

3640
01:39:35,831 --> 01:39:38,500
I don't know if you wrote it about it
in the thing because I didn't read it.

3641
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:39,190
I,

3642
01:39:39,190 --> 01:39:40,510
I've had that thing for years.

3643
01:39:40,530 --> 01:39:40,830
That's it.

3644
01:39:40,830 --> 01:39:42,010
And even take a look at that.

3645
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:45,820
I dread to him over the phone and
then he made me stop and I said,

3646
01:39:45,821 --> 01:39:46,031
all right,

3647
01:39:46,031 --> 01:39:46,990
I won't read any more of it.

3648
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:51,760
I was just two years ago I got thing
has been sitting in my fucking,

3649
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:53,260
my office for tariff.

3650
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:56,150
I think it's like 2004
so what year was this?

3651
01:39:56,260 --> 01:39:57,640
Wait til I didn't date it.

3652
01:39:57,670 --> 01:40:00,340
2004 or 2005 I believe it was.

3653
01:40:01,270 --> 01:40:02,103
Yeah.

3654
01:40:02,770 --> 01:40:03,490
It's cool though.

3655
01:40:03,490 --> 01:40:03,890
I mean you're,

3656
01:40:03,890 --> 01:40:04,111
you,

3657
01:40:04,111 --> 01:40:06,490
you got a window into a
certain time in your life.

3658
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:07,450
You know where you were.

3659
01:40:07,990 --> 01:40:09,130
You were in the shits.

3660
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:10,670
Well,

3661
01:40:10,670 --> 01:40:11,181
I'll tell you,

3662
01:40:11,181 --> 01:40:12,014
man,

3663
01:40:12,050 --> 01:40:14,330
that unfortunately happens.

3664
01:40:14,690 --> 01:40:16,570
But you know,

3665
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:17,131
can you say that?

3666
01:40:17,131 --> 01:40:18,390
But I don't think it's unfortunate at all.

3667
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:18,691
Oh,

3668
01:40:18,691 --> 01:40:18,990
right.

3669
01:40:18,990 --> 01:40:19,291
I got you.

3670
01:40:19,291 --> 01:40:20,550
If you were stuck with that check now.

3671
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:20,940
No,

3672
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:21,773
Jesus Christ.

3673
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:22,741
Think about that.

3674
01:40:22,741 --> 01:40:24,960
Think about your situation now and
thinking about your situation then.

3675
01:40:24,990 --> 01:40:25,950
How much happier you are now,

3676
01:40:25,951 --> 01:40:26,191
right?

3677
01:40:26,191 --> 01:40:27,180
You could have been stuck.

3678
01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:28,050
I mean,

3679
01:40:28,050 --> 01:40:28,291
if,

3680
01:40:28,291 --> 01:40:28,591
you know,

3681
01:40:28,591 --> 01:40:31,050
if you talked her in to taking
you back or something gross.

3682
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:32,273
Oh,

3683
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:33,550
with a child or something.

3684
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:36,661
You know what I mean?

3685
01:40:36,661 --> 01:40:38,030
It's funny how you,

3686
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:38,470
you,

3687
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:39,810
you're a different human now.

3688
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:41,580
You're so much more confident.

3689
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:41,941
You know?

3690
01:40:41,941 --> 01:40:44,460
It's one of the things that I
saw when you went up in Montreal,

3691
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:45,030
right?

3692
01:40:45,030 --> 01:40:46,110
Like even your sats now,

3693
01:40:46,111 --> 01:40:48,450
you're so much more
confident he'd go up there.

3694
01:40:48,451 --> 01:40:49,290
You're so much more.

3695
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:49,760
You,

3696
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:50,400
you know,

3697
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,540
you're so much more,

3698
01:40:52,110 --> 01:40:52,930
what's the word,

3699
01:40:52,930 --> 01:40:53,161
you,

3700
01:40:53,161 --> 01:40:53,491
you,

3701
01:40:53,491 --> 01:40:55,750
you were resigned to who?

3702
01:40:55,751 --> 01:40:56,920
You are not,

3703
01:40:56,921 --> 01:40:57,910
not resigned rather,

3704
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:59,630
you're not the right word,

3705
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:02,500
but it's not resigned that that's cause
that sounds like you're giving up.

3706
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:03,071
It's not,

3707
01:41:03,071 --> 01:41:03,760
that's not what I mean.

3708
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:04,031
You're,

3709
01:41:04,031 --> 01:41:06,370
you are completely aware of who you are.

3710
01:41:06,371 --> 01:41:07,420
That's the best way of saying it.

3711
01:41:08,230 --> 01:41:10,690
When you're going on stage
now you're going on stage,

3712
01:41:10,710 --> 01:41:12,940
not trying to convince them of anything.

3713
01:41:12,970 --> 01:41:13,480
You're just,

3714
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:16,150
this is me and this is what I'm
doing is what I have to say.

3715
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:17,830
Whereas before you were like,

3716
01:41:17,831 --> 01:41:18,101
Hey,

3717
01:41:18,101 --> 01:41:19,210
I hope you like me.

3718
01:41:19,620 --> 01:41:20,470
Do you like me?

3719
01:41:20,471 --> 01:41:21,131
You don't like me.

3720
01:41:21,131 --> 01:41:22,360
Well here I'm gonna say something,

3721
01:41:22,361 --> 01:41:23,030
I guess.

3722
01:41:23,030 --> 01:41:24,290
I guess that weirded me out.

3723
01:41:24,291 --> 01:41:24,540
Okay.

3724
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:29,010
I think the reason the word
resigned popped out of your
mouth first is because I

3725
01:41:29,011 --> 01:41:31,620
think there is a certain level of being,

3726
01:41:32,130 --> 01:41:33,900
and it sounds like it's
like I'm giving up,

3727
01:41:33,901 --> 01:41:38,040
but resigned can also be like a
kind of surrender where you're like,

3728
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:41,850
I'm just no longer going to spend time,

3729
01:41:41,851 --> 01:41:45,300
whether on stage or off stage.

3730
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,190
I'm not going to spend time anymore.

3731
01:41:47,191 --> 01:41:50,910
Trying to convince myself or other
people that I'm some certain way and I'm

3732
01:41:50,911 --> 01:41:54,150
going to start trying to approach
people from where I'm at.

3733
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:54,780
Yes.

3734
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:55,350
Which is,

3735
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:59,040
which is not a perfect
place for most people.

3736
01:41:59,041 --> 01:42:00,450
Most most of us are,

3737
01:42:01,050 --> 01:42:01,883
you know,

3738
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:03,990
have fucked up things that we do.

3739
01:42:03,991 --> 01:42:04,980
And why wouldn't you?

3740
01:42:04,981 --> 01:42:05,221
I mean,

3741
01:42:05,221 --> 01:42:07,080
you're going to look at where you're at.

3742
01:42:07,410 --> 01:42:08,071
Like you say,

3743
01:42:08,071 --> 01:42:10,710
we're in a fucking ball
flying through fucking space.

3744
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:15,030
How are you supposed to adapt
to this in some brilliant way,

3745
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:16,500
right off the bat,

3746
01:42:16,530 --> 01:42:17,610
you know you can,

3747
01:42:17,611 --> 01:42:18,240
it's a champ.

3748
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:22,470
You're in this insane dimension where
were getting rocketed through space where

3749
01:42:22,471 --> 01:42:23,490
you're gonna die.

3750
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:27,720
You're surrounded by people
who call themselves your
family that you're supposed

3751
01:42:27,721 --> 01:42:29,070
to have attachments to.

3752
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:30,450
They're going to die.

3753
01:42:30,451 --> 01:42:34,260
You're in a life where you've just
adopted certain modes of being.

3754
01:42:34,261 --> 01:42:35,610
I didn't have a baby,

3755
01:42:35,790 --> 01:42:36,870
I didn't get married,

3756
01:42:37,170 --> 01:42:41,340
but a lot of people do when they weren't
ready and they weren't supposed to and

3757
01:42:41,341 --> 01:42:42,060
they get married,

3758
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:46,440
they have a baby and they are
theoretically for this incarnation,

3759
01:42:46,590 --> 01:42:48,610
pretty fucking trapped there in

3760
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:49,510
a lot of people are.

3761
01:42:49,510 --> 01:42:50,440
A lot of people haven't yet.

3762
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:53,590
They have all kinds of weird
situations where the relationship,

3763
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:55,120
they're stuck somehow or another,

3764
01:42:55,121 --> 01:42:58,180
whether it's because of a mortgage or
because of a business that they started

3765
01:42:58,181 --> 01:42:58,840
together

3766
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:02,540
me a mental idea of how
things are supposed to deal
with some person or you give

3767
01:43:02,541 --> 01:43:07,541
birth to a child that has like a a melted
brain and you've got to take care of

3768
01:43:08,181 --> 01:43:13,181
like a little like sick kid for 12 years
or like there's so many different ways

3769
01:43:14,031 --> 01:43:19,031
that your particular DNA can get regulated
down into a shitty trap where you're

3770
01:43:20,811 --> 01:43:21,970
just like there.

3771
01:43:22,190 --> 01:43:22,761
It's like a,

3772
01:43:22,761 --> 01:43:23,870
that's why I liked that movie.

3773
01:43:23,871 --> 01:43:26,840
You said you didn't want to see it and
I'm sorry if you've seen it in like it,

3774
01:43:26,841 --> 01:43:28,880
but what was that hundred and 27 hours?

3775
01:43:28,881 --> 01:43:29,610
Did you see that?

3776
01:43:29,610 --> 01:43:29,881
No,

3777
01:43:29,881 --> 01:43:32,220
I didn't see it because
I knew the story and I,

3778
01:43:32,221 --> 01:43:32,960
you know,

3779
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:33,793
I don't want to watch it.

3780
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:35,570
It's a torture movie.

3781
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:36,770
There's no reason to watch it.

3782
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:39,140
Everybody says that it's a torture movie.

3783
01:43:39,141 --> 01:43:41,540
Like it was fixated on the Gore or the,

3784
01:43:41,780 --> 01:43:42,381
but it wasn't,

3785
01:43:42,381 --> 01:43:43,340
it's a fucking metaphor,

3786
01:43:43,341 --> 01:43:44,174
which is that,

3787
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:44,690
uh,

3788
01:43:44,690 --> 01:43:49,390
some times doing the thing you
love to do whatever it is and,

3789
01:43:49,391 --> 01:43:53,960
and that's for a lot of people's
doing the thing you love most,

3790
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:57,430
you can end up getting
your goddamn arm pen.

3791
01:43:57,540 --> 01:43:57,680
Yeah.

3792
01:43:57,680 --> 01:43:57,990
You're,

3793
01:43:57,990 --> 01:44:00,840
you're connecting someone having
a baby to cutting your arm off.

3794
01:44:00,841 --> 01:44:01,290
That's funny.

3795
01:44:01,290 --> 01:44:01,711
No,

3796
01:44:01,711 --> 01:44:02,544
I'm kidding.

3797
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:03,120
No,

3798
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:05,720
I'm not connecting if you have
a baby for the right reason.

3799
01:44:05,770 --> 01:44:05,891
No,

3800
01:44:05,891 --> 01:44:07,180
I know what you're saying
for the wrong reasons.

3801
01:44:07,210 --> 01:44:07,481
I know,

3802
01:44:07,481 --> 01:44:08,120
I know what you're saying.

3803
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:08,650
Yeah.

3804
01:44:08,650 --> 01:44:11,950
You were saying what a lot
of single people with no
children say and what you're

3805
01:44:11,951 --> 01:44:12,641
saying is,

3806
01:44:12,641 --> 01:44:12,971
you know,

3807
01:44:12,971 --> 01:44:16,150
we were talking about our friend who
tweeted something about having a child is

3808
01:44:16,151 --> 01:44:18,280
like the exact opposite
of winning the lottery.

3809
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:19,060
Yeah.

3810
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:21,400
I used to think the exact
same way until I had children.

3811
01:44:21,640 --> 01:44:24,880
But my situation is
very different in that,

3812
01:44:24,910 --> 01:44:25,391
first of all,

3813
01:44:25,391 --> 01:44:26,590
I'm older,

3814
01:44:26,591 --> 01:44:28,980
I've had more experience in life and um,

3815
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:32,830
I'm secure financially and
happy in the relationship.

3816
01:44:32,831 --> 01:44:35,230
So it was all good things at a good time.

3817
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:37,930
But when I look back
on past relationships,

3818
01:44:37,931 --> 01:44:38,580
some of them,

3819
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:40,600
there was a bunch of
relationships that I've been in,

3820
01:44:40,810 --> 01:44:41,260
you know,

3821
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:45,490
like way back in the day when I was
younger and I really didn't know what the

3822
01:44:45,491 --> 01:44:48,040
fuck I was doing and I was hanging
around with chicks that I probably really

3823
01:44:48,041 --> 01:44:49,150
didn't even like that much,

3824
01:44:49,151 --> 01:44:50,680
but I was still having sex with them.

3825
01:44:50,860 --> 01:44:54,520
And sometimes you'd have like a
crazy fucking breakup are crazy bad

3826
01:44:54,521 --> 01:44:55,030
relationship.

3827
01:44:55,030 --> 01:44:58,690
That person could be out there with your
kid and then you have to deal with all

3828
01:44:58,691 --> 01:45:01,000
kinds of nonsense that comes with that.

3829
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:01,301
I mean,

3830
01:45:01,301 --> 01:45:03,000
we all know somebody that has kids,

3831
01:45:03,010 --> 01:45:03,843
you know,

3832
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:05,190
shit situation.

3833
01:45:05,230 --> 01:45:06,010
Yeah.

3834
01:45:06,010 --> 01:45:06,480
So I,

3835
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:07,750
I hear what you're saying man,

3836
01:45:07,930 --> 01:45:08,810
what did but that,

3837
01:45:08,811 --> 01:45:09,644
so what,

3838
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:09,951
yeah,

3839
01:45:09,951 --> 01:45:12,230
what I'm really saying is like the,

3840
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:16,370
the idea and it goes back to what we're
being comfortable resigned to who you

3841
01:45:16,371 --> 01:45:17,204
are.

3842
01:45:17,330 --> 01:45:19,490
That's where I didn't like
the way I said resign though.

3843
01:45:19,491 --> 01:45:20,324
I didn't mean reside.

3844
01:45:20,650 --> 01:45:21,530
I sometimes,

3845
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:23,180
sometimes you have to be resigned,

3846
01:45:23,330 --> 01:45:23,931
you know what I mean?

3847
01:45:23,931 --> 01:45:25,730
Not all of us are fucking Charlie Sheen,

3848
01:45:25,870 --> 01:45:28,280
not all stars from Mars.

3849
01:45:28,281 --> 01:45:30,530
Not all of us are a freaking
rock star from Mars.

3850
01:45:30,531 --> 01:45:30,980
Yeah.

3851
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:32,060
Some of us are like,

3852
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:32,660
you know,

3853
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:36,040
we all don't to pretend that
I'm not special or fucked
up and a lot of ways man,

3854
01:45:36,041 --> 01:45:36,191
and,

3855
01:45:36,191 --> 01:45:36,890
and that's,

3856
01:45:36,890 --> 01:45:37,671
if you start from,

3857
01:45:37,671 --> 01:45:38,504
it's like,

3858
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:39,441
you know,

3859
01:45:39,441 --> 01:45:41,840
one thing that I would try to
do when I used to work out,

3860
01:45:41,841 --> 01:45:42,740
and it's like when I,

3861
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:43,220
when I,

3862
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:44,720
when I first started working out,

3863
01:45:45,110 --> 01:45:49,820
how would try to lift weight that was so
much more heavy than what I should have

3864
01:45:49,821 --> 01:45:53,930
been lifting out of this sense of
like I could lift heavy weights.

3865
01:45:53,930 --> 01:45:56,920
And so now I'm like trying
to live like way too.

3866
01:45:56,950 --> 01:45:57,670
Why am I like,

3867
01:45:57,670 --> 01:45:59,510
why should be at the fucking pink weights?

3868
01:45:59,630 --> 01:46:01,300
And I'm like trying to do a quick,

3869
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:01,911
you know what I mean?

3870
01:46:01,911 --> 01:46:05,300
I'm trying to do like really fucking heavy
weights cause it's like this is how I

3871
01:46:05,301 --> 01:46:09,610
see myself down the line after I've
been lifting pink waits for a while.

3872
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:11,060
That's how you get to the heavyweights,

3873
01:46:11,090 --> 01:46:11,420
right?

3874
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:15,380
But if you start off right away trying
to pump those fucking heavyweights,

3875
01:46:15,590 --> 01:46:16,880
then it's disaster.

3876
01:46:16,881 --> 01:46:20,100
You're going to pull your
fucking muscles like people how,

3877
01:46:20,130 --> 01:46:20,610
you know,

3878
01:46:20,610 --> 01:46:22,220
like due to lifting weights.

3879
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:23,300
One Guy I think came up to me,

3880
01:46:23,301 --> 01:46:26,360
he's like looking at me
like what are you doing?

3881
01:46:26,361 --> 01:46:26,661
He's like,

3882
01:46:26,661 --> 01:46:29,510
that's way too much weight.

3883
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:33,620
And so this is like having a kid when
you're 16 having a kid when you were 16 or

3884
01:46:33,621 --> 01:46:36,230
deciding that you're a
famous comedian before you,

3885
01:46:36,231 --> 01:46:40,520
are you getting on stage after a couple
of months and getting in your fucking

3886
01:46:40,521 --> 01:46:41,390
head that you're like,

3887
01:46:41,391 --> 01:46:46,280
you've been doing standup for 15 years
or being a fucking painter when and like

3888
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:49,010
just immediately thinking you're a great
painter because I've had friends who've

3889
01:46:49,230 --> 01:46:49,920
into painting,

3890
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:50,550
right?

3891
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:54,060
And they've only painted for a year and
they show me some of their paintings and

3892
01:46:54,061 --> 01:46:55,200
the look on their face is like,

3893
01:46:55,230 --> 01:46:56,490
I'm supposed to react to it.

3894
01:46:56,491 --> 01:46:58,380
Like I'm seeing a Picasso or something.

3895
01:46:58,381 --> 01:46:58,910
It's like

3896
01:46:58,910 --> 01:47:03,080
I hate almost everyone that shows me
things that I'm supposed to look at that

3897
01:47:03,081 --> 01:47:06,050
they did almost every time
someone does that to me and Mike,

3898
01:47:06,610 --> 01:47:07,610
are you really going to do this to me?

3899
01:47:07,611 --> 01:47:07,890
Mom,

3900
01:47:07,890 --> 01:47:12,530
please don't make me
read your fucking script.

3901
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:14,510
Don't ask me to read your script.

3902
01:47:14,511 --> 01:47:16,130
You Fuck Hey Daddy,

3903
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:17,090
you read my script row.

3904
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:18,073
It's the worst.

3905
01:47:18,410 --> 01:47:22,100
The worst is when it's bad and then
you're obligated to talk to them and go,

3906
01:47:22,101 --> 01:47:22,330
all right,

3907
01:47:22,330 --> 01:47:23,330
here's the situation.

3908
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:23,931
You know,

3909
01:47:23,931 --> 01:47:28,931
you basically did men and black meets
back to the future written by a 12 year

3910
01:47:29,091 --> 01:47:29,580
old.

3911
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:30,130
You know,

3912
01:47:30,130 --> 01:47:30,963
like it's like

3913
01:47:32,810 --> 01:47:33,800
you can't even say that.

3914
01:47:33,801 --> 01:47:34,150
You have to go,

3915
01:47:34,150 --> 01:47:34,610
wow,

3916
01:47:34,610 --> 01:47:35,151
it's pretty good,

3917
01:47:35,151 --> 01:47:35,630
man.

3918
01:47:35,630 --> 01:47:36,463
It's pretty good.

3919
01:47:36,490 --> 01:47:36,680
Well,

3920
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:38,020
now see that's the thing.

3921
01:47:38,170 --> 01:47:39,190
That's where you get,

3922
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:40,600
and I think kind of what
we're talking about,

3923
01:47:40,601 --> 01:47:43,840
which is like at some point
you have to make a decision.

3924
01:47:44,350 --> 01:47:49,030
Am I going to spend the rest
of my life lying to the world?

3925
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:53,020
Am I going to spend the rest of my life
meant trying to manipulate people around

3926
01:47:53,021 --> 01:47:57,240
me because I'm too lazy to tell them
the truth or am I just going to start

3927
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:58,310
telling the truth?

3928
01:47:58,380 --> 01:47:59,131
Well what if it though,

3929
01:47:59,131 --> 01:48:01,290
if it's a friend that's written
something really cool though.

3930
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:02,800
What if someone who's
got a script and I mean,

3931
01:48:02,801 --> 01:48:05,550
so that's the problem with
all the shitheads that want
you to read their scripts

3932
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:08,910
and makes you super skeptical for the
occasional rare person and actually write

3933
01:48:08,911 --> 01:48:09,570
something good.

3934
01:48:09,570 --> 01:48:09,960
Right?

3935
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:10,441
And it's just like,

3936
01:48:10,441 --> 01:48:10,561
Hey,

3937
01:48:10,561 --> 01:48:11,470
I think this is pretty good.

3938
01:48:11,490 --> 01:48:12,323
You want to read it?

3939
01:48:12,330 --> 01:48:13,090
And then you're like,

3940
01:48:13,090 --> 01:48:13,411
all right,

3941
01:48:13,411 --> 01:48:13,920
I'll read it.

3942
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:14,431
You know what I mean?

3943
01:48:14,431 --> 01:48:14,820
How many,

3944
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:15,720
how many of those are there?

3945
01:48:16,030 --> 01:48:17,950
People I know who are
really good at things,

3946
01:48:18,190 --> 01:48:19,630
they don't ask me to look at it.

3947
01:48:19,690 --> 01:48:22,030
I ended up looking at it cause I want to,

3948
01:48:22,050 --> 01:48:22,480
yeah,

3949
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:23,560
like my friend email,

3950
01:48:23,561 --> 01:48:25,990
he just visited like his
music's fucking good.

3951
01:48:26,170 --> 01:48:29,980
So like I try to get new cds of his
cause I want to listen to it cause it's

3952
01:48:29,981 --> 01:48:31,210
really fucking good.

3953
01:48:31,370 --> 01:48:31,570
Yeah.

3954
01:48:31,570 --> 01:48:35,740
But sometimes somebody else sends you
something or somebody be in their car if

3955
01:48:35,741 --> 01:48:37,550
they're a musician and then
they'll put their shit off.

3956
01:48:37,730 --> 01:48:38,590
You have to listen to it

3957
01:48:40,860 --> 01:48:41,590
or do that.

3958
01:48:41,590 --> 01:48:43,930
That is ever let a musician drive.

3959
01:48:45,350 --> 01:48:49,640
I never let them get in your car with
a CD in your hand to your fucking hand

3960
01:48:52,180 --> 01:48:53,170
cause you're suddenly,

3961
01:48:53,171 --> 01:48:57,820
you're forced suddenly not
just to evaluate how miserable
and artists they are,

3962
01:48:57,850 --> 01:48:59,890
how cliche and shitty their music is.

3963
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:03,730
But also you have to re you realize
that the fact that they felt comfortable

3964
01:49:03,850 --> 01:49:06,430
playing this for you means
they think it's good.

3965
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:06,850
Yeah.

3966
01:49:06,850 --> 01:49:07,400
These are they,

3967
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:09,260
they're so diluted and so fucked up.

3968
01:49:09,261 --> 01:49:09,581
They were like,

3969
01:49:09,581 --> 01:49:10,270
Oh yeah,

3970
01:49:10,270 --> 01:49:10,870
I'm going to I,

3971
01:49:10,870 --> 01:49:13,230
they've been waiting all day to
play their music because they

3972
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:16,600
to a script or a piece
of music or a joke or,

3973
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:19,690
I mean how many times have you had a
friend who's just starting out and they

3974
01:49:19,691 --> 01:49:20,560
have a bit and you've got,

3975
01:49:20,561 --> 01:49:21,161
you want to tell them.

3976
01:49:21,161 --> 01:49:22,750
I came in and you need to drop that bit.

3977
01:49:22,751 --> 01:49:23,031
That bit.

3978
01:49:23,031 --> 01:49:23,201
Yeah.

3979
01:49:23,201 --> 01:49:23,830
Good.

3980
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:24,131
I'm like,

3981
01:49:24,131 --> 01:49:24,251
no,

3982
01:49:24,251 --> 01:49:24,431
no,

3983
01:49:24,431 --> 01:49:24,611
no.

3984
01:49:24,611 --> 01:49:25,330
It's good.

3985
01:49:25,330 --> 01:49:25,841
It's good.

3986
01:49:25,841 --> 01:49:26,141
It's good.

3987
01:49:26,141 --> 01:49:26,710
It's good.

3988
01:49:26,710 --> 01:49:27,101
Just to,

3989
01:49:27,101 --> 01:49:28,210
this is a bad crowd tonight.

3990
01:49:28,510 --> 01:49:29,201
I'm been doing it.

3991
01:49:29,201 --> 01:49:30,580
It's been killing you.

3992
01:49:30,581 --> 01:49:33,460
You're fundamentally looking at the
whole premise and what he's saying and

3993
01:49:33,461 --> 01:49:33,700
you're like,

3994
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:34,900
this is a shit joke dude.

3995
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:35,640
Terrible.

3996
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:36,240
Yeah.

3997
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:37,110
Someone clunker.

3998
01:49:37,180 --> 01:49:38,290
If someone's just been doing,

3999
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:40,330
if someone's been doing
standup for less than a year,

4000
01:49:40,750 --> 01:49:43,600
I don't even critique their material
cause I know they're going to grow out of

4001
01:49:43,601 --> 01:49:45,580
it and it's going to change
and it's going to get,

4002
01:49:45,581 --> 01:49:46,414
it's like,

4003
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:48,290
well there's the first year of stand

4004
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:49,030
up.

4005
01:49:49,030 --> 01:49:51,340
You can't do any.

4006
01:49:51,370 --> 01:49:52,660
You're lucky if you're,

4007
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:53,710
if you're really,

4008
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:55,340
well isn't that like a any bay,

4009
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:58,750
it's only takes a couple of things to
add to something and that's the whole

4010
01:49:58,751 --> 01:49:59,081
point.

4011
01:49:59,081 --> 01:50:00,910
It no bit starts off like a grade,

4012
01:50:00,911 --> 01:50:01,960
a bit from the beginning.

4013
01:50:01,961 --> 01:50:05,140
Usually it's usually you have some kind
of idea and you tried to go through it

4014
01:50:05,141 --> 01:50:07,630
and then like add to it
and make it an actual bit.

4015
01:50:07,631 --> 01:50:08,464
Right.

4016
01:50:08,470 --> 01:50:09,490
So that's what's weird about me.

4017
01:50:09,491 --> 01:50:12,610
Cause like I'll go on stage and people
come up to me and go to that bit sucks or

4018
01:50:12,611 --> 01:50:13,061
whatever.

4019
01:50:13,061 --> 01:50:13,480
But I'm like,

4020
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:13,751
yeah,

4021
01:50:13,751 --> 01:50:15,910
but this is like the second
time I've ever said it,

4022
01:50:16,060 --> 01:50:16,541
you know?

4023
01:50:16,541 --> 01:50:18,040
So you know,

4024
01:50:18,180 --> 01:50:21,100
the thing is it's like there's no
fucking rules about about it or anything.

4025
01:50:21,101 --> 01:50:22,120
It just takes a long time.

4026
01:50:22,150 --> 01:50:22,760
I mean,

4027
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:23,593
and

4028
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:26,160
Vance and someone who's only
been doing comedy for a year,

4029
01:50:26,161 --> 01:50:26,341
you know,

4030
01:50:26,341 --> 01:50:27,330
you're doing pretty good right now.

4031
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:27,790
Yeah.

4032
01:50:27,790 --> 01:50:27,970
You,

4033
01:50:27,970 --> 01:50:28,180
you,

4034
01:50:28,180 --> 01:50:28,531
you're,

4035
01:50:28,531 --> 01:50:28,831
you,

4036
01:50:28,831 --> 01:50:30,810
you've also had the opportunity to do,

4037
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:31,681
do stand up,

4038
01:50:31,681 --> 01:50:36,681
take off for five years and be around
high level standup comedy on a regular

4039
01:50:36,721 --> 01:50:37,141
basis.

4040
01:50:37,141 --> 01:50:38,670
You're always at the Improv.

4041
01:50:38,671 --> 01:50:39,960
You're always at south.

4042
01:50:40,170 --> 01:50:40,891
You go on the road,

4043
01:50:40,891 --> 01:50:42,820
you see Joey crush and Ari crushes.

4044
01:50:42,821 --> 01:50:45,030
See me do my sets and
saw all these fucking,

4045
01:50:45,060 --> 01:50:46,560
this comedy is in your head.

4046
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:46,981
I mean,

4047
01:50:46,981 --> 01:50:50,040
you're getting to see like you
get to see bill burr all the time.

4048
01:50:50,041 --> 01:50:51,090
Whenever he's in town,

4049
01:50:51,091 --> 01:50:52,990
you see Louis C K you've seen the ship,

4050
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,900
how you've seen so many fucking comics,

4051
01:50:54,901 --> 01:50:55,590
man.

4052
01:50:55,590 --> 01:50:55,861
He's like,

4053
01:50:55,861 --> 01:50:59,100
your exposure to high level
standup comedy is much,

4054
01:50:59,370 --> 01:51:00,300
much more,

4055
01:51:00,330 --> 01:51:00,790
uh,

4056
01:51:00,790 --> 01:51:01,240
you know,

4057
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:03,440
it's a much deeper than
the average open miker

4058
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:03,921
definitely.

4059
01:51:03,921 --> 01:51:05,480
But it doesn't help me write anymore,

4060
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:06,021
you know what I mean?

4061
01:51:06,021 --> 01:51:06,260
That's,

4062
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:06,800
that's what I did.

4063
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:07,633
Like yesterday,

4064
01:51:07,670 --> 01:51:08,570
yesterday I was like,

4065
01:51:08,590 --> 01:51:08,991
all right,

4066
01:51:08,991 --> 01:51:11,600
I'm going to do no new.

4067
01:51:11,630 --> 01:51:13,130
Like this is all new jokes night,

4068
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:13,551
you know,

4069
01:51:13,551 --> 01:51:14,130
yesterday.

4070
01:51:14,130 --> 01:51:14,361
Right.

4071
01:51:14,361 --> 01:51:14,850
And I was like,

4072
01:51:14,850 --> 01:51:15,111
fuck,

4073
01:51:15,111 --> 01:51:15,980
I didn't write anything.

4074
01:51:15,981 --> 01:51:17,360
So I'm like looking
through my notes going,

4075
01:51:17,361 --> 01:51:17,571
okay,

4076
01:51:17,571 --> 01:51:18,231
there was an idea.

4077
01:51:18,231 --> 01:51:18,840
There's an idea,

4078
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:20,060
there's trying to make bits,

4079
01:51:20,061 --> 01:51:21,440
but I didn't write any of this shit out,

4080
01:51:21,441 --> 01:51:22,101
so I want to stage,

4081
01:51:22,101 --> 01:51:22,710
I pretty much did,

4082
01:51:22,710 --> 01:51:23,390
had nothing,

4083
01:51:23,390 --> 01:51:23,721
you know,

4084
01:51:23,721 --> 01:51:24,121
it's,

4085
01:51:24,121 --> 01:51:24,401
it's,

4086
01:51:24,401 --> 01:51:27,650
it's funny like writing into
me or at least thinking of,

4087
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:30,980
you can go on stage balls out like
that with nothing in your head.

4088
01:51:30,981 --> 01:51:32,300
You have to have some materials.

4089
01:51:32,301 --> 01:51:32,810
Right.

4090
01:51:32,810 --> 01:51:34,190
Well usually I like this kind of,

4091
01:51:34,191 --> 01:51:34,231
yeah.

4092
01:51:34,231 --> 01:51:34,360
Do

4093
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:36,820
those of your Joey throwing
around doing it a long time?

4094
01:51:36,821 --> 01:51:40,300
Like I'll go on stage sometimes and I'll
fuck around and I don't know what I'm

4095
01:51:40,301 --> 01:51:40,500
gonna say.

4096
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:42,640
Like I came up with that
bit about the birds.

4097
01:51:42,910 --> 01:51:43,211
Again,

4098
01:51:43,211 --> 01:51:45,070
there's birds are falling from the sky,

4099
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:45,581
you know,

4100
01:51:45,581 --> 01:51:46,331
and everyone's like,

4101
01:51:46,331 --> 01:51:46,601
oh,

4102
01:51:46,601 --> 01:51:47,910
it's a fucking apocalypse man.

4103
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:48,080
Look,

4104
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:48,830
the burns,

4105
01:51:48,830 --> 01:51:49,270
I'm like,

4106
01:51:49,270 --> 01:51:51,850
one thing that you don't
consider is that birds are cunts.

4107
01:51:52,030 --> 01:51:52,510
Okay?

4108
01:51:52,510 --> 01:51:53,380
First of all,

4109
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:55,510
who cares about birds
falling from the fucking sky?

4110
01:51:55,511 --> 01:51:56,620
Birds don't give a shit about you.

4111
01:51:56,770 --> 01:51:58,300
They're surviving dinosaurs.

4112
01:51:58,510 --> 01:51:59,320
And second of all,

4113
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:00,790
why do we think that it's apocalypse?

4114
01:52:00,791 --> 01:52:05,791
Maybe at some one badass worm becomes
a sorcerer and just decides to get back

4115
01:52:05,861 --> 01:52:09,280
all these conti birds that had been
fucking with his family for generations.

4116
01:52:09,281 --> 01:52:09,911
And you know,

4117
01:52:09,911 --> 01:52:11,980
he's wearing a wizard's
robe and he's just,

4118
01:52:11,981 --> 01:52:12,814
it's called winning,

4119
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:14,770
you know?

4120
01:52:14,770 --> 01:52:15,341
So this,

4121
01:52:15,341 --> 01:52:15,821
this bid,

4122
01:52:15,821 --> 01:52:15,971
I,

4123
01:52:15,971 --> 01:52:18,880
it's turned into a bit and
it came out out of nowhere.

4124
01:52:18,910 --> 01:52:19,361
Literally.

4125
01:52:19,361 --> 01:52:20,770
I had no idea what I was going to say,

4126
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:24,010
but I knew that if I had no nothing there,

4127
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:25,090
I have another bid ready.

4128
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:26,110
That is actually a bit.

4129
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:26,860
All right.

4130
01:52:26,860 --> 01:52:28,690
And so because you have like these little,

4131
01:52:28,870 --> 01:52:30,220
these little bridges,

4132
01:52:30,370 --> 01:52:30,761
you know that,

4133
01:52:30,761 --> 01:52:32,090
you know that you have this be,

4134
01:52:32,170 --> 01:52:33,100
this bridge is built.

4135
01:52:33,101 --> 01:52:35,800
I'm going to go right into fire
at the San Francisco Hotel.

4136
01:52:35,950 --> 01:52:36,341
Boom.

4137
01:52:36,341 --> 01:52:36,881
It's right there.

4138
01:52:36,881 --> 01:52:37,714
It's solid.

4139
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:41,560
And so I know that I can take a chance
like let's just swing off this vine and

4140
01:52:41,650 --> 01:52:43,630
hope I can catch that bridge or you know,

4141
01:52:43,631 --> 01:52:44,680
or catch up on that.

4142
01:52:44,681 --> 01:52:45,440
I didn't know was there.

4143
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:47,270
How cool is it when that start,

4144
01:52:47,271 --> 01:52:51,140
when you start killing
and you're improvising and
your end depth bizarre like

4145
01:52:51,141 --> 01:52:54,320
wave where suddenly you're
not doing any jokes and then

4146
01:52:55,190 --> 01:53:00,010
sometimes I've improvised and done well
and then tried to go back and do it.

4147
01:53:00,011 --> 01:53:00,770
Joke.

4148
01:53:00,770 --> 01:53:01,101
Yeah.

4149
01:53:01,101 --> 01:53:04,400
And it doesn't do as well because they
were so used to that stuff that was

4150
01:53:04,401 --> 01:53:05,420
coming in the moment.

4151
01:53:05,450 --> 01:53:05,901
Yes.

4152
01:53:05,901 --> 01:53:08,930
Like that's a weird thing
man where you can tell too.

4153
01:53:08,931 --> 01:53:09,531
They feel it.

4154
01:53:09,531 --> 01:53:10,101
They sense it.

4155
01:53:10,101 --> 01:53:11,610
He's doing material as well.

4156
01:53:11,630 --> 01:53:13,860
And then also they can tell
that you're free ball and two,

4157
01:53:13,910 --> 01:53:15,920
I can tell him when Joey Diaz free balls,

4158
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:17,620
like sometimes I'll
run up to him offstage.

4159
01:53:17,660 --> 01:53:17,960
I go,

4160
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:18,980
did you plan that one?

4161
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:19,431
And they'll go,

4162
01:53:19,431 --> 01:53:19,760
Nah,

4163
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:21,020
I fucking came up with the right there.

4164
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:21,591
Like the,

4165
01:53:21,591 --> 01:53:23,420
he did a joke about his dick,

4166
01:53:23,470 --> 01:53:25,040
but he was doing his thing about Viagra.

4167
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:27,860
This was the Sunday night
show him [inaudible] he was
doing the thing about you

4168
01:53:27,861 --> 01:53:29,030
and you'd have a copter dead Dick.

4169
01:53:29,031 --> 01:53:30,170
He never cut the dead Dick.

4170
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:30,621
He goes,

4171
01:53:30,621 --> 01:53:31,454
if your Dick's dead,

4172
01:53:31,490 --> 01:53:32,180
this is what you do.

4173
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:33,520
You go out of total fucking refrigerator,

4174
01:53:33,521 --> 01:53:35,850
you'd get those popsicle sticks
and your rep that Dick Up.

4175
01:53:35,850 --> 01:53:38,630
I got fucking wounded
soldier send it back in.

4176
01:53:38,870 --> 01:53:40,310
He was talking about putting your ticket,

4177
01:53:40,311 --> 01:53:43,790
a splint with popsicle sticks
and the way you saying it,

4178
01:53:43,791 --> 01:53:44,720
it was fucking,

4179
01:53:44,721 --> 01:53:45,800
it was so it was,

4180
01:53:45,801 --> 01:53:50,390
there's a feeling of magic as he was
saying this and he is killing before he

4181
01:53:50,391 --> 01:53:51,110
says this.

4182
01:53:51,110 --> 01:53:54,520
So he goes into this like
red faced like Joey Diaz,

4183
01:53:54,530 --> 01:53:55,363
purple faced,

4184
01:53:55,430 --> 01:53:57,140
screaming spits flying out.

4185
01:53:57,141 --> 01:53:58,550
You never copped a dead Dick.

4186
01:53:58,730 --> 01:54:00,800
You send that thick in
like a wounded soldier.

4187
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:03,440
And me and Ari were fucking crying,

4188
01:54:03,441 --> 01:54:06,980
laughing and I couldn't wait to for him
to get off stage so I could ask him.

4189
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:08,600
Was that off the top of your head today?

4190
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:10,220
He said it came out of nowhere.

4191
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:11,150
Just came out of nowhere.

4192
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:14,510
Like all of a sudden it seemed like a
bit like it was all there and it was

4193
01:54:14,511 --> 01:54:18,830
because he was willing to swing just
to take this chance and see where,

4194
01:54:18,890 --> 01:54:19,723
where it brings you.

4195
01:54:19,790 --> 01:54:23,120
You have to be able to do that though
in front of several hundred people is

4196
01:54:23,121 --> 01:54:23,630
rare.

4197
01:54:23,630 --> 01:54:24,351
Like you,

4198
01:54:24,351 --> 01:54:25,580
your stage right now,

4199
01:54:25,581 --> 01:54:27,020
you can't quite do that yet.

4200
01:54:27,021 --> 01:54:30,410
What your stage right now when you got
to do is you've got to write things down.

4201
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:35,550
Well my at that though with the come on
your face that that was made up onstage.

4202
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:36,951
What Ben?

4203
01:54:36,951 --> 01:54:38,210
Is that the pets?

4204
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:42,830
Oh well yeah that was a line you came
up with a line for an already existing

4205
01:54:42,831 --> 01:54:43,220
pit?

4206
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:43,370
No,

4207
01:54:43,370 --> 01:54:43,530
no,

4208
01:54:43,530 --> 01:54:43,780
no.

4209
01:54:43,780 --> 01:54:45,540
That whole bit was written onstage.

4210
01:54:45,580 --> 01:54:46,030
Really?

4211
01:54:46,030 --> 01:54:46,810
Yeah.

4212
01:54:46,810 --> 01:54:47,920
And it just came up on one day.

4213
01:54:47,921 --> 01:54:48,101
I don't know,

4214
01:54:48,101 --> 01:54:49,000
it was the Sunday show.

4215
01:54:49,060 --> 01:54:49,281
I mean,

4216
01:54:49,281 --> 01:54:50,021
so that's what I been talking about.

4217
01:54:50,021 --> 01:54:53,670
I'll do that all the time where I'll
think just like either on stage or walk.

4218
01:54:53,671 --> 01:54:54,400
Right when I'm going to,

4219
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:55,830
like the other day I
had this thing where it

4220
01:54:55,980 --> 01:54:57,780
talking about that before
you ever did it on stage,

4221
01:54:57,781 --> 01:54:58,170
Brian,

4222
01:54:58,170 --> 01:54:59,730
you've talked about that a few times.

4223
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:02,250
What before you had been talked
about the ex girlfriends,

4224
01:55:02,251 --> 01:55:02,730
how the you,

4225
01:55:02,730 --> 01:55:05,220
you have these pets from them and
they all have the same personality.

4226
01:55:05,620 --> 01:55:05,831
Yeah,

4227
01:55:05,831 --> 01:55:06,664
but I didn't it,

4228
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:07,960
I mean when the first time I went to,

4229
01:55:07,961 --> 01:55:08,800
I thought of that bit,

4230
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:09,580
I was sick,

4231
01:55:09,580 --> 01:55:12,730
seriously waiting for the [inaudible]
in front of me to get off stage and I'm

4232
01:55:12,731 --> 01:55:16,270
just thinking like I got to do something
about my animals cause I flick,

4233
01:55:16,271 --> 01:55:17,590
I'm a single mom right now.

4234
01:55:17,740 --> 01:55:19,090
And so I went on stage and they've said,

4235
01:55:19,210 --> 01:55:19,451
hey,

4236
01:55:19,451 --> 01:55:19,631
you know,

4237
01:55:19,631 --> 01:55:20,560
I feel like a single mom.

4238
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:22,620
Oh blogging when you talk to me about it,

4239
01:55:22,621 --> 01:55:23,760
you'd already done it on stage.

4240
01:55:23,790 --> 01:55:24,241
Maybe it's that.

4241
01:55:24,241 --> 01:55:24,490
Yeah.

4242
01:55:24,490 --> 01:55:25,323
Yeah.

4243
01:55:25,330 --> 01:55:26,310
I don't like when people do that,

4244
01:55:26,311 --> 01:55:28,710
when they pretend they're having a
conversation with you and really they're

4245
01:55:28,711 --> 01:55:29,580
trying out material.

4246
01:55:29,610 --> 01:55:30,443
Okay.

4247
01:55:30,980 --> 01:55:33,820
What's worse is when it's very obvious.

4248
01:55:33,821 --> 01:55:34,001
You know,

4249
01:55:34,001 --> 01:55:36,640
some people could actually get away with
it cause you're like telling the joke

4250
01:55:36,641 --> 01:55:38,830
and they think you know it's
funny but some people just,

4251
01:55:38,831 --> 01:55:40,150
you could tell they just doing bits.

4252
01:55:40,250 --> 01:55:40,490
There's a

4253
01:55:40,490 --> 01:55:42,380
dude I used to play pool
with and it was brutal.

4254
01:55:42,381 --> 01:55:43,920
He was a comic and he used to go

4255
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:45,690
tell me if you think
there's anything in this,

4256
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:47,333
no,

4257
01:55:47,780 --> 01:55:49,320
don't drop my head down.

4258
01:55:49,321 --> 01:55:52,590
He didn't have a whole lot of friends and
he was like really into his comedy and

4259
01:55:52,591 --> 01:55:53,251
he was one of those guys.

4260
01:55:53,251 --> 01:55:57,660
He was a decent comic but he wrote out
every fucking joke as he would say it on

4261
01:55:57,661 --> 01:55:58,080
stage.

4262
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:02,040
So it never seemed like when he was on
stage it was really just up there fucking

4263
01:56:02,041 --> 01:56:02,400
around.

4264
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:03,233
It always seemed like,

4265
01:56:03,390 --> 01:56:05,850
here's some material that I wrote today,

4266
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:07,670
Dee Dee Dee.

4267
01:56:08,070 --> 01:56:11,760
And so he like holds me hostage
there while we're playing pool.

4268
01:56:11,970 --> 01:56:14,910
And while he says out the whole joke,

4269
01:56:15,150 --> 01:56:16,560
you know like literally,

4270
01:56:16,830 --> 01:56:18,600
have you ever noticed
like he gives me a hug

4271
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:19,770
if you have noticed.

4272
01:56:19,860 --> 01:56:21,430
No Q motherfucker.

4273
01:56:21,460 --> 01:56:22,241
Did you just give me a,

4274
01:56:22,241 --> 01:56:23,230
have you ever noticed,

4275
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:24,640
you ever notice?

4276
01:56:24,670 --> 01:56:26,020
I noticed a lot of shit dude.

4277
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:27,100
You want to talk about other shit?

4278
01:56:27,101 --> 01:56:28,360
I noticed man,

4279
01:56:28,370 --> 01:56:28,990
that's the Pr,

4280
01:56:28,990 --> 01:56:30,520
that's the problem with comedy man.

4281
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:31,720
There's like gay comedy,

4282
01:56:31,960 --> 01:56:36,160
but they're like the shitty
comedian is a pathetic figure.

4283
01:56:36,161 --> 01:56:39,580
Managed is such a rough mode of being man.

4284
01:56:39,581 --> 01:56:40,414
It's such a,

4285
01:56:40,450 --> 01:56:43,180
such a silly embarrassing existence.

4286
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:44,920
What's the idea that you,

4287
01:56:44,921 --> 01:56:47,430
you command the attention of the crowd.

4288
01:56:47,431 --> 01:56:47,851
You are,

4289
01:56:47,851 --> 01:56:49,350
your voice is amplified.

4290
01:56:49,590 --> 01:56:49,771
Your,

4291
01:56:49,771 --> 01:56:53,190
there's a light spot put on
you and you are supposedly,

4292
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:53,940
you know,

4293
01:56:53,940 --> 01:56:57,810
so entertaining and interesting that all
you have to do is talk and you're going

4294
01:56:57,811 --> 01:57:02,700
to grab the attention of all these
people in this room and you're requesting

4295
01:57:02,701 --> 01:57:04,980
this exorbitant amount of attention.

4296
01:57:05,190 --> 01:57:08,850
And it's because you claim to have this
skill and this skill is you're going to

4297
01:57:08,851 --> 01:57:09,690
elicit laughter.

4298
01:57:09,691 --> 01:57:11,550
Going to extract laughter
from the audience.

4299
01:57:11,750 --> 01:57:12,000
Yeah.

4300
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:12,833
Good luck.

4301
01:57:13,010 --> 01:57:14,380
It was really weird lately.

4302
01:57:14,381 --> 01:57:17,840
If I have been noticing there's
this whole breed of comic,

4303
01:57:17,890 --> 01:57:18,140
uh,

4304
01:57:18,140 --> 01:57:20,090
open miker mostly,

4305
01:57:20,091 --> 01:57:20,390
but,

4306
01:57:20,390 --> 01:57:20,960
uh,

4307
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:21,231
that,

4308
01:57:21,231 --> 01:57:22,640
that does their whole act,

4309
01:57:22,641 --> 01:57:24,740
but not once did you think no,

4310
01:57:24,741 --> 01:57:25,610
there's a joke there.

4311
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:26,260
Meaning like,

4312
01:57:26,260 --> 01:57:28,620
like they're just talking and like the,

4313
01:57:28,710 --> 01:57:30,920
they're forgetting that this
is supposed to be funny.

4314
01:57:30,921 --> 01:57:34,130
Almost like they're almost saying a story
and when they're done with the story,

4315
01:57:34,190 --> 01:57:35,420
they expect you to clap it,

4316
01:57:35,421 --> 01:57:36,170
then you'd,

4317
01:57:36,170 --> 01:57:36,530
you know,

4318
01:57:36,530 --> 01:57:37,191
nothing in,

4319
01:57:37,191 --> 01:57:38,690
it was even a joke where it's like,

4320
01:57:38,810 --> 01:57:41,360
is that their sense of humor is that bad?

4321
01:57:41,361 --> 01:57:44,450
Or they just don't get
thorough conquers open?

4322
01:57:44,451 --> 01:57:45,251
Miker so you're,

4323
01:57:45,251 --> 01:57:45,980
you're just like,

4324
01:57:45,980 --> 01:57:46,820
that's like saying like,

4325
01:57:46,821 --> 01:57:47,930
how come this guy who,

4326
01:57:47,931 --> 01:57:48,440
uh,

4327
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:48,741
you know,

4328
01:57:48,741 --> 01:57:50,120
doesn't know how to throw
a punch at all things.

4329
01:57:50,121 --> 01:57:51,290
He's going to be on the ultimate fighter.

4330
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:51,940
You know,

4331
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:52,170
you're,

4332
01:57:52,170 --> 01:57:52,860
you're just there.

4333
01:57:52,860 --> 01:57:53,690
They're not good.

4334
01:57:53,690 --> 01:57:54,270
They're in Compton.

4335
01:57:54,270 --> 01:57:56,540
It's so amazing that people
can be that bad though.

4336
01:57:56,600 --> 01:57:58,520
What's amazing is that
can be that bad forever.

4337
01:57:58,521 --> 01:57:58,731
I mean,

4338
01:57:58,731 --> 01:58:00,290
how many dudes you've ever
seen at the comedy store?

4339
01:58:00,291 --> 01:58:03,500
They've been doing standup for 10 plus
years doing open mics and they're still

4340
01:58:03,501 --> 01:58:05,570
like brutally so insane.

4341
01:58:05,690 --> 01:58:07,040
Like how do you use it for Gri?

4342
01:58:07,041 --> 01:58:10,130
You should progress like you're
talented in the opposite way.

4343
01:58:10,131 --> 01:58:14,270
The fact that you haven't gotten better
at all and you've been doing it for some

4344
01:58:14,271 --> 01:58:15,470
people 15 years,

4345
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:19,610
I don't think you can get better
if you're not good at all.

4346
01:58:20,090 --> 01:58:20,780
I think,

4347
01:58:20,780 --> 01:58:20,980
you know,

4348
01:58:20,980 --> 01:58:24,320
there are some guys that get into comedy
that truly don't understand what comedy

4349
01:58:24,321 --> 01:58:26,720
is and they see other people
doing it and talking it,

4350
01:58:26,721 --> 01:58:30,980
but they're so socially unaware that they
don't know how they come off to other

4351
01:58:30,981 --> 01:58:33,860
people and they probably
don't have the tools,

4352
01:58:33,890 --> 01:58:35,450
the psychological tools,

4353
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:39,680
the cognitive tools to really
objectively assess their own personality.

4354
01:58:39,830 --> 01:58:41,410
So they're never going
to be able to do right.

4355
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:42,610
Literally are never going to be,

4356
01:58:42,611 --> 01:58:45,960
you have to have a certain amount
of awareness in order to do standup.

4357
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,350
And there's a lot of
people that attempt it.

4358
01:58:47,351 --> 01:58:48,490
They just don't have that.

4359
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:49,473
They don't have it.

4360
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:50,350
And if you don't have it,

4361
01:58:50,351 --> 01:58:50,950
man,

4362
01:58:50,950 --> 01:58:51,750
you got to do,

4363
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:53,020
there's something has to happen.

4364
01:58:53,021 --> 01:58:53,561
Dramatic.

4365
01:58:53,561 --> 01:58:57,210
You got to go to Mexico
and do Ibogaine Iowasca me,

4366
01:58:57,440 --> 01:58:58,110
something like that.

4367
01:58:58,110 --> 01:58:58,570
Yeah,

4368
01:58:58,570 --> 01:58:59,310
I blow.

4369
01:58:59,310 --> 01:58:59,641
Yeah.

4370
01:58:59,641 --> 01:59:00,041
Yeah.

4371
01:59:00,041 --> 01:59:00,701
The come back.

4372
01:59:00,701 --> 01:59:01,000
Yeah.

4373
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,970
You literally have to
become a different person.

4374
01:59:03,130 --> 01:59:04,960
The person that you are is just you.

4375
01:59:04,961 --> 01:59:06,040
You what you have is like,

4376
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:08,410
it's like I want to race in
the Formula One Grand Prix,

4377
01:59:08,411 --> 01:59:09,820
but I have a Toyota Camry.

4378
01:59:09,821 --> 01:59:12,640
What do you think I should
do while you're fucked?

4379
01:59:12,670 --> 01:59:13,490
Yeah,

4380
01:59:13,490 --> 01:59:17,170
just fucking cars go 250 miles an hour
and they're three inches off the ground.

4381
01:59:17,171 --> 01:59:18,004
And where,

4382
01:59:18,460 --> 01:59:18,950
what are you going to do?

4383
01:59:18,950 --> 01:59:19,450
You're not gonna,

4384
01:59:19,450 --> 01:59:20,201
you're not gonna do that.

4385
01:59:20,201 --> 01:59:21,190
You know you're not equipped for it.

4386
01:59:21,191 --> 01:59:22,480
You have to change your equipment,

4387
01:59:22,950 --> 01:59:23,783
you know

4388
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:24,560
that's it.

4389
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:25,430
That's what it takes.

4390
01:59:25,431 --> 01:59:29,060
The snake must shed its God
damn skin from time to time.

4391
01:59:29,061 --> 01:59:31,450
And this is the right phrase

4392
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:34,353
friend.

4393
01:59:35,670 --> 01:59:36,010
We're,

4394
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:38,980
you're all slow dude.

4395
01:59:38,981 --> 01:59:40,720
I'm the same dude.

4396
01:59:40,830 --> 01:59:41,210
Ah,

4397
01:59:41,210 --> 01:59:41,740
you know,

4398
01:59:41,740 --> 01:59:42,410
I've just,

4399
01:59:42,410 --> 01:59:45,980
this is kind of like a weird
off topic idea that I've had,

4400
01:59:45,981 --> 01:59:47,780
but I wanted to tell you about
it cause I had this weird,

4401
01:59:47,781 --> 01:59:49,130
cause you were a Catholic,

4402
01:59:49,210 --> 01:59:50,700
this whole thing is off topic.

4403
01:59:50,710 --> 01:59:51,000
Evan.

4404
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:51,241
No,

4405
01:59:51,241 --> 01:59:54,750
we never say off the top of this bug
is off this script that we'd been

4406
01:59:54,751 --> 01:59:55,700
rehearsing for the last,

4407
01:59:55,710 --> 01:59:56,580
I was raised Catholic.

4408
01:59:56,581 --> 01:59:57,010
Yeah.

4409
01:59:57,010 --> 01:59:57,843
Um,

4410
01:59:58,100 --> 01:59:58,450
and in,

4411
01:59:58,450 --> 01:59:58,870
in,

4412
01:59:58,870 --> 02:00:03,100
in religion there's this idea of tithing
where you're supposed to get your 10%

4413
02:00:03,101 --> 02:00:04,450
of your income income to the church.

4414
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:06,100
So dude,

4415
02:00:06,101 --> 02:00:09,760
I've started thinking about that and
I've started thinking like how fucking

4416
02:00:09,761 --> 02:00:14,761
interesting would your life get if you
decided to give 10% of your income,

4417
02:00:15,550 --> 02:00:16,750
not to the church,

4418
02:00:16,990 --> 02:00:21,990
but you decided to like give 10% of your
income to do like really cool things

4419
02:00:24,431 --> 02:00:26,020
for people randomly.

4420
02:00:26,470 --> 02:00:27,303
You know what I mean?

4421
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:27,971
I see what you're saying.

4422
02:00:27,971 --> 02:00:28,380
You know what I mean?

4423
02:00:28,380 --> 02:00:30,580
Your own sort of the church offering.

4424
02:00:30,610 --> 02:00:30,911
Yeah.

4425
02:00:30,911 --> 02:00:33,850
But it's not no churches involved
or anything you'd just like,

4426
02:00:33,980 --> 02:00:38,110
cause like the man like to go back
to the idea of psychedelic states,

4427
02:00:38,111 --> 02:00:40,030
things that induce psychedelic states.

4428
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:45,840
Fucking helping someone randomly that
doesn't expect you to like if you go out

4429
02:00:46,061 --> 02:00:47,080
and you think I'm going to go,

4430
02:00:47,710 --> 02:00:51,310
I'm not a big fan of giving money to
like people in front of seven 11 you were

4431
02:00:51,311 --> 02:00:52,630
like covered in sores.

4432
02:00:52,630 --> 02:00:55,690
I think that that's like kind of
like a way of killing somebody.

4433
02:00:55,990 --> 02:01:00,640
But like if you go out and have some
extra money and decided I'm going to do

4434
02:01:00,641 --> 02:01:05,380
something cool with this or you just try
to like convert your financial energy

4435
02:01:05,610 --> 02:01:09,580
and to some positive thing that you
randomly do for someone and you decide I'm

4436
02:01:09,581 --> 02:01:12,430
going to do this from two
to four o'clock today.

4437
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:13,353
Right.

4438
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:14,710
That puts you in the weirdest,

4439
02:01:14,711 --> 02:01:18,850
most psychedelic state and when you do
some random good thing for somebody,

4440
02:01:19,300 --> 02:01:19,571
dude,

4441
02:01:19,571 --> 02:01:21,130
it blows people's minds.

4442
02:01:21,380 --> 02:01:23,020
Like they freak the fuck out.

4443
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,500
Like the look on their faces,

4444
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:29,520
like what just happened to me because
everything is inverted and our society

4445
02:01:30,551 --> 02:01:31,690
towards the south,

4446
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:34,150
everyone is always
thinking about themselves.

4447
02:01:34,330 --> 02:01:36,340
Everyone's always fixating on themselves.

4448
02:01:36,341 --> 02:01:40,100
If if for two hours you don't
fixate on yourself long enough to go

4449
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:42,740
do some random fucking thing for somebody.

4450
02:01:43,070 --> 02:01:43,431
Dude,

4451
02:01:43,431 --> 02:01:44,270
it's trippy.

4452
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:46,820
I definitely think that it
put an energy in towards,

4453
02:01:46,850 --> 02:01:47,091
you know,

4454
02:01:47,091 --> 02:01:47,361
any,

4455
02:01:47,361 --> 02:01:49,490
any sort of charitable notion,

4456
02:01:49,550 --> 02:01:49,760
any,

4457
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:51,680
anything where you re helping people.

4458
02:01:51,770 --> 02:01:52,551
It definitely is the,

4459
02:01:52,551 --> 02:01:55,160
the right kind of energy to
put out there in the world.

4460
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:56,900
It definitely can induce,

4461
02:01:57,020 --> 02:01:57,290
you know,

4462
02:01:57,290 --> 02:01:58,520
a different state of mind,

4463
02:01:58,521 --> 02:01:59,570
a different state of being.

4464
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:01,250
But if the charity thing,

4465
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:02,473
which is great,

4466
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:03,650
I mean anything is good like,

4467
02:02:03,651 --> 02:02:04,370
but when you know,

4468
02:02:04,370 --> 02:02:08,150
you call it and you give money to somebody
or you have some kind of fund that

4469
02:02:08,151 --> 02:02:11,690
you put money into the outstanding
I'm talking about like physically,

4470
02:02:11,750 --> 02:02:12,311
I know what you're saying.

4471
02:02:12,311 --> 02:02:12,611
Okay.

4472
02:02:12,611 --> 02:02:13,220
Yeah.

4473
02:02:13,220 --> 02:02:13,941
How many charitable,

4474
02:02:13,941 --> 02:02:15,680
I mean like going out and helping people.

4475
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:16,491
I definitely agree.

4476
02:02:16,491 --> 02:02:16,850
I mean,

4477
02:02:16,850 --> 02:02:19,880
how many of these fucking organizations
keep getting busted charitable

4478
02:02:19,881 --> 02:02:21,080
organizations when you find out like,

4479
02:02:21,220 --> 02:02:21,590
oh,

4480
02:02:21,590 --> 02:02:24,650
the white club John Thing for Haiti and
you know that you find out they're all

4481
02:02:24,651 --> 02:02:26,210
stealing money and it's like,

4482
02:02:26,211 --> 02:02:26,661
it's always,

4483
02:02:26,661 --> 02:02:27,410
it's always some,

4484
02:02:27,410 --> 02:02:28,730
something like that was always going down,

4485
02:02:28,910 --> 02:02:31,370
doing random cool things for people.

4486
02:02:31,610 --> 02:02:32,121
It does,

4487
02:02:32,121 --> 02:02:32,360
uh,

4488
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:35,360
it gives you like a definitely gives
you some sort of a weird charge.

4489
02:02:35,580 --> 02:02:35,780
You know,

4490
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:38,110
when I gave away my
isolation tank on time,

4491
02:02:38,300 --> 02:02:38,990
um,

4492
02:02:38,990 --> 02:02:39,570
that was a,

4493
02:02:39,570 --> 02:02:41,210
one of the coolest things
I ever did because,

4494
02:02:41,211 --> 02:02:44,660
I mean this is fucking $8,000 a
piece of equipment and some dude,

4495
02:02:44,661 --> 02:02:45,770
I don't even know just,

4496
02:02:45,780 --> 02:02:47,360
and then bought salt.

4497
02:02:47,390 --> 02:02:50,510
Salt was like 1200 bucks and
then had it moved to his house,

4498
02:02:50,511 --> 02:02:50,691
you know,

4499
02:02:50,691 --> 02:02:53,840
I had to pay for a moving company and
then I had to pay for an installer to go

4500
02:02:53,841 --> 02:02:54,680
install it in his house.

4501
02:02:54,830 --> 02:02:55,021
I mean,

4502
02:02:55,021 --> 02:02:57,260
one of the fucking guy doesn't
even use it at bastard.

4503
02:02:57,680 --> 02:02:58,161
Yeah Man,

4504
02:02:58,161 --> 02:02:58,250
I'm,

4505
02:02:58,250 --> 02:02:59,680
I want to ask him for it back on.

4506
02:02:59,690 --> 02:03:00,523
Give it to you.

4507
02:03:00,590 --> 02:03:02,200
Do you have a place that it works out?

4508
02:03:02,820 --> 02:03:03,720
The best place to have it.

4509
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:05,160
Perfect place for a day.

4510
02:03:05,210 --> 02:03:06,043
You need to get one.

4511
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:07,700
It's his man cave.

4512
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:08,180
Yeah.

4513
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:08,660
We need to,

4514
02:03:08,660 --> 02:03:10,730
we need to get your fucking man cave.

4515
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:13,430
I got a place right next to
a shower where it could just,

4516
02:03:13,580 --> 02:03:18,580
I could basically go right from the
flotation world needs Duncan Trussell to

4517
02:03:18,651 --> 02:03:19,920
have a fucking isolation tank.

4518
02:03:20,450 --> 02:03:22,250
God hear my prayer.

4519
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:23,390
Really?

4520
02:03:23,390 --> 02:03:24,860
You need to mix horizon iPhone.

4521
02:03:24,980 --> 02:03:25,191
Yeah.

4522
02:03:25,191 --> 02:03:25,491
What do you,

4523
02:03:25,491 --> 02:03:26,324
what you are with,

4524
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:26,990
um,

4525
02:03:26,990 --> 02:03:27,680
with a,

4526
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:28,513
well you've got,

4527
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:30,050
you've got a couple of
different projects going on,

4528
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:31,580
but when one of these hits,

4529
02:03:31,581 --> 02:03:31,910
man,

4530
02:03:31,910 --> 02:03:34,250
when you get your first fat
check and we're going to get you,

4531
02:03:34,251 --> 02:03:35,570
if this guy won't give up the time,

4532
02:03:35,571 --> 02:03:36,740
I don't think this guy
wants to give up his tank.

4533
02:03:36,770 --> 02:03:37,220
I think he's getting,

4534
02:03:37,220 --> 02:03:38,450
he's going through a divorce now though.

4535
02:03:38,810 --> 02:03:40,370
So he might have to move the tank.

4536
02:03:40,371 --> 02:03:42,110
You might not have the
money to reset the tank up.

4537
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:42,800
Right.

4538
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:43,720
I'll store it for him.

4539
02:03:43,970 --> 02:03:46,880
I talked to him about it like a year
after I sent it to him and he's like,

4540
02:03:46,881 --> 02:03:47,091
yeah,

4541
02:03:47,091 --> 02:03:47,901
I hardly ever use it.

4542
02:03:47,901 --> 02:03:48,171
I'm like,

4543
02:03:48,171 --> 02:03:49,340
you fuck.

4544
02:03:49,860 --> 02:03:50,091
I'm like,

4545
02:03:50,091 --> 02:03:51,950
God damn happened to do it randomly.

4546
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:52,551
Yeah,

4547
02:03:52,551 --> 02:03:53,121
but you know,

4548
02:03:53,121 --> 02:03:54,170
I figured anybody that was,

4549
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:57,020
I mean he and the guy was like
a wannabe standup comedian.

4550
02:03:57,021 --> 02:03:58,160
He's like trying to be a comic.

4551
02:03:58,790 --> 02:03:59,990
It's like Jesus Christ,

4552
02:03:59,991 --> 02:04:00,171
dude,

4553
02:04:00,171 --> 02:04:03,290
I gave you a fucking doorway to the
universe and you don't open it and go

4554
02:04:03,291 --> 02:04:03,591
through it.

4555
02:04:03,591 --> 02:04:04,251
Every now and then.

4556
02:04:04,251 --> 02:04:05,900
He's got his old checks in there.

4557
02:04:06,020 --> 02:04:07,250
I bet there's no water in it.

4558
02:04:07,251 --> 02:04:08,790
He just puts all boxes in it.

4559
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:11,120
I was thinking I would
have just built a shed.

4560
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:13,250
I just build a shed
for a washer and dryer.

4561
02:04:13,251 --> 02:04:14,090
You know how easy it would have been.

4562
02:04:14,091 --> 02:04:15,320
Just a build a shed for that.

4563
02:04:15,550 --> 02:04:15,860
That would be,

4564
02:04:15,860 --> 02:04:16,910
would you have used it though?

4565
02:04:17,090 --> 02:04:17,891
I've never been in one,

4566
02:04:17,891 --> 02:04:19,820
so I'll probably say it.

4567
02:04:20,110 --> 02:04:21,200
I'd never been in one,

4568
02:04:21,201 --> 02:04:22,010
so probably.

4569
02:04:22,010 --> 02:04:22,401
But yeah,

4570
02:04:22,401 --> 02:04:24,860
but I've offered you to go
to the soothing solutions.

4571
02:04:24,861 --> 02:04:25,700
You've never gone to that.

4572
02:04:26,030 --> 02:04:26,761
Do you want to go to that?

4573
02:04:26,761 --> 02:04:29,030
Never made the call you
want when you want to do it,

4574
02:04:29,031 --> 02:04:29,430
I'll do it.

4575
02:04:29,430 --> 02:04:30,263
We'll set it up,

4576
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:31,273
set it up.

4577
02:04:31,430 --> 02:04:32,420
Or you can go to float lab.

4578
02:04:32,450 --> 02:04:33,620
That's the best place to float.

4579
02:04:33,621 --> 02:04:35,600
Lab ones are on another
level they're got Craig,

4580
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:39,960
if you're in a go to float lab.com
and look at what this guy's doing.

4581
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:43,200
This guy was making these super
fucking thick stainless steel.

4582
02:04:43,201 --> 02:04:45,240
Insulated tanks isn't the greatest.

4583
02:04:45,530 --> 02:04:47,280
There is like the apple a flotation.

4584
02:04:47,281 --> 02:04:47,610
Yeah.

4585
02:04:47,610 --> 02:04:49,190
He's just a bad motherfucker.

4586
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:51,330
He's like this crazy mad scientist dude.

4587
02:04:51,331 --> 02:04:52,560
He's like really into floating.

4588
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:53,670
He's trying to invent some,

4589
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:56,550
some new screen where you can watch.

4590
02:04:56,550 --> 02:05:00,270
It's the lowest amount of light is coming
through these LCD screens so you can

4591
02:05:00,271 --> 02:05:04,400
watch like documentaries inside the tank
and you can learn from it learn and it

4592
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:05,550
helps you have like,

4593
02:05:05,551 --> 02:05:06,510
it defeats the purpose.

4594
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:07,330
I think so,

4595
02:05:07,330 --> 02:05:08,370
but I'm not into it at all.

4596
02:05:08,850 --> 02:05:11,150
It's kind of interesting
information blasted.

4597
02:05:11,500 --> 02:05:11,730
Well,

4598
02:05:11,730 --> 02:05:14,430
that's what he's saying is
that when you don't have,

4599
02:05:14,460 --> 02:05:16,470
when you have an absence of sensory input,

4600
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:16,751
you,

4601
02:05:16,751 --> 02:05:19,350
you can really absorb information
in a much faster rate.

4602
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:22,410
And it totally makes sense on
paper because the whole idea,

4603
02:05:22,590 --> 02:05:22,831
I mean,

4604
02:05:22,831 --> 02:05:23,041
look,

4605
02:05:23,041 --> 02:05:26,820
it's very difficult to watch a movie if
there's jackhammers going on behind you.

4606
02:05:27,050 --> 02:05:28,200
It's distracting you.

4607
02:05:28,540 --> 02:05:33,540
You had a float tank that had a
interactive surface on the top of it,

4608
02:05:34,350 --> 02:05:38,100
so they can turn completely
dark if you want it to.

4609
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:39,031
But if you want,

4610
02:05:39,031 --> 02:05:42,900
you could light the entire fucking
thing up with like the universe,

4611
02:05:42,940 --> 02:05:44,070
the Milky Way.

4612
02:05:44,290 --> 02:05:44,730
Uh,

4613
02:05:44,730 --> 02:05:45,311
I don't know.

4614
02:05:45,311 --> 02:05:47,330
It just blue sky or whatever,

4615
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:52,340
just fucking Sanskrit versus from like
all the great scriptures flying on there.

4616
02:05:53,041 --> 02:05:56,510
It'd be incredible Sanskrit
versus when did you,

4617
02:05:56,511 --> 02:05:58,200
would you look at the translation?

4618
02:05:58,230 --> 02:05:58,680
Do you,

4619
02:05:58,680 --> 02:05:59,011
do you,

4620
02:05:59,011 --> 02:05:59,400
uh,

4621
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:01,290
how long would it take to learn Sanskrit?

4622
02:06:02,130 --> 02:06:03,960
I like a 10 year project.

4623
02:06:04,170 --> 02:06:05,610
I think it would take a long fucking time,

4624
02:06:05,611 --> 02:06:07,320
but I don't know if
anybody would be into that.

4625
02:06:07,321 --> 02:06:08,280
I would think it would be you.

4626
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:13,320
I'd love to just because it's
Sanskrit and and Tibetan.

4627
02:06:14,250 --> 02:06:18,420
When I'm on mushrooms and I start like
you close your eyes and you see those

4628
02:06:18,421 --> 02:06:19,410
weird symbols.

4629
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:20,730
I see a gypsum and stuff.

4630
02:06:20,850 --> 02:06:22,310
See that's the thing and I always wonder,

4631
02:06:22,350 --> 02:06:22,681
these,

4632
02:06:22,681 --> 02:06:23,580
these symbols are seeing,

4633
02:06:23,581 --> 02:06:25,160
I always think Mayan looking thing.

4634
02:06:25,290 --> 02:06:26,550
I knew how to read this.

4635
02:06:26,910 --> 02:06:30,210
Would I be reading like some
kind of message here is this,

4636
02:06:30,211 --> 02:06:33,960
am I actually looking at
some kind of scripture?

4637
02:06:34,050 --> 02:06:35,250
You know what Mckenna believes?

4638
02:06:35,251 --> 02:06:38,940
Actually what he thought was
that when you do a psychedelic,

4639
02:06:38,970 --> 02:06:43,080
what you're doing is your taking part
in the experience of everyone else who's

4640
02:06:43,081 --> 02:06:44,850
also done that psychedelic.

4641
02:06:45,120 --> 02:06:45,890
That's why he,

4642
02:06:45,890 --> 02:06:50,010
we just described ketamine is such an
odd psychedelic because it seems like its

4643
02:06:50,011 --> 02:06:51,630
database of users was very,

4644
02:06:51,631 --> 02:06:52,464
very small,

4645
02:06:52,470 --> 02:06:56,430
so he said Ketamine felt like an
office building that was empty.

4646
02:06:56,520 --> 02:07:00,210
It would go in there and it's just
empty cubicles like where is everybody?

4647
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:01,710
Whereas mushrooms you do it.

4648
02:07:01,740 --> 02:07:06,740
You're dealing with 10,000 years of
obsessive daily use by millions of people

4649
02:07:07,510 --> 02:07:08,343
over the world.

4650
02:07:08,490 --> 02:07:11,370
And a lot of those being the
Mayans mean a Mayans were heavily,

4651
02:07:11,371 --> 02:07:12,570
heavily into mushrooms.

4652
02:07:12,810 --> 02:07:13,021
You know,

4653
02:07:13,021 --> 02:07:13,471
when I was,

4654
02:07:13,471 --> 02:07:14,304
um,

4655
02:07:14,550 --> 02:07:14,881
in,

4656
02:07:14,881 --> 02:07:15,180
uh,

4657
02:07:15,180 --> 02:07:15,920
when I was in a,

4658
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:17,700
and Eatsa and I went on a tour,

4659
02:07:17,870 --> 02:07:20,010
the guy that took me
on a god was a really,

4660
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:20,910
really interesting guy.

4661
02:07:20,910 --> 02:07:21,321
He was a,

4662
02:07:21,321 --> 02:07:22,031
a local,

4663
02:07:22,031 --> 02:07:24,270
a university professor who also,

4664
02:07:24,271 --> 02:07:24,690
uh,

4665
02:07:24,690 --> 02:07:25,411
did guides,

4666
02:07:25,411 --> 02:07:26,550
like did tours and shit like that.

4667
02:07:26,551 --> 02:07:29,250
It's just really deep
into the history of it.

4668
02:07:29,251 --> 02:07:31,890
And he just openly talked
about the psychedelics,

4669
02:07:31,891 --> 02:07:34,590
like how they would take psychedelics and
they had all different rooms that they

4670
02:07:34,591 --> 02:07:35,200
would know,

4671
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:36,580
practice different rituals in.

4672
02:07:36,581 --> 02:07:38,350
And it's well known that there was a deep,

4673
02:07:38,351 --> 02:07:39,500
deep history in Mexico of,

4674
02:07:39,501 --> 02:07:40,870
of psychedelic mushroom use.

4675
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:43,030
So it's not surprising
that when you do mushrooms,

4676
02:07:43,300 --> 02:07:45,610
and especially if you do mushrooms
that you buy in California,

4677
02:07:45,820 --> 02:07:46,151
you know,

4678
02:07:46,151 --> 02:07:46,451
I mean,

4679
02:07:46,451 --> 02:07:46,631
you're,

4680
02:07:46,631 --> 02:07:50,110
you're probably getting the
same strains that the Mayans,

4681
02:07:50,111 --> 02:07:50,420
God,

4682
02:07:50,420 --> 02:07:50,760
I mean,

4683
02:07:50,760 --> 02:07:53,050
you're probably getting those
mock those Mexican mushrooms.

4684
02:07:53,300 --> 02:07:53,551
Yeah.

4685
02:07:53,551 --> 02:07:56,080
You see all sorts of Weird Mayan symbols.

4686
02:07:56,230 --> 02:07:59,710
It's almost like what you're doing is
you're somehow or another tapping into

4687
02:07:59,711 --> 02:08:00,430
there,

4688
02:08:00,430 --> 02:08:01,300
the past people,

4689
02:08:01,301 --> 02:08:02,440
psychedelic experiences.

4690
02:08:02,470 --> 02:08:03,640
Obviously this is all just,

4691
02:08:04,230 --> 02:08:05,250
what are we all going to go?

4692
02:08:05,251 --> 02:08:06,330
Each room's me,

4693
02:08:06,540 --> 02:08:07,140
US three,

4694
02:08:07,140 --> 02:08:09,300
we shouldn't do it and we should just
go fucking on the beach somewhere.

4695
02:08:09,930 --> 02:08:11,530
As long as they don't have psilocybin.

4696
02:08:11,531 --> 02:08:14,280
And then my love to eat mushrooms
that you guys silicide been,

4697
02:08:14,490 --> 02:08:14,970
what do you mean?

4698
02:08:14,970 --> 02:08:16,080
That's what makes you trick.

4699
02:08:16,620 --> 02:08:18,330
As long as they don't
have psilocybin in them.

4700
02:08:18,690 --> 02:08:23,690
I don't want you to Talki eating
mushrooms to 500 buildings by now.

4701
02:08:24,151 --> 02:08:26,270
At least the 3000 or police officers.

4702
02:08:26,330 --> 02:08:26,650
Yeah.

4703
02:08:26,650 --> 02:08:28,290
Tentatively listening with a notepad.

4704
02:08:28,620 --> 02:08:30,330
They just said they're going to the beach.

4705
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:33,990
It's just as ridiculous that mushrooms
are illegal as Monsanto trying to,

4706
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:35,970
to patent a pig.

4707
02:08:36,220 --> 02:08:37,320
It's just as ridiculous.

4708
02:08:37,410 --> 02:08:37,770
Yeah.

4709
02:08:37,770 --> 02:08:41,340
The fuck is one person going
to tell you that some spore of,

4710
02:08:41,341 --> 02:08:41,611
of,

4711
02:08:41,611 --> 02:08:42,780
of fucking plant,

4712
02:08:43,020 --> 02:08:44,670
a living organism that grow by the way,

4713
02:08:44,671 --> 02:08:47,300
which is actually closer to a
human than plants already here.

4714
02:08:47,310 --> 02:08:47,860
Yes.

4715
02:08:47,860 --> 02:08:48,150
You know,

4716
02:08:48,150 --> 02:08:48,721
spores are,

4717
02:08:48,721 --> 02:08:48,910
are,

4718
02:08:48,910 --> 02:08:52,620
are closer to Austin then
cause they eat organic matter.

4719
02:08:52,630 --> 02:08:53,430
Yeah.

4720
02:08:53,430 --> 02:08:54,263
But dude,

4721
02:08:54,390 --> 02:08:55,410
I mean how fucking crazy.

4722
02:08:55,411 --> 02:08:56,800
It's not just that someone feels okay,

4723
02:08:57,030 --> 02:09:01,710
like the enforcing the law if you eat
those fucking things that make you see

4724
02:09:01,711 --> 02:09:06,540
some kind of weird transcendental language
that the Mayans were trying to copy

4725
02:09:06,541 --> 02:09:06,960
down.

4726
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:07,591
That's what I think.

4727
02:09:07,591 --> 02:09:09,330
I think they're seeing a
language and they're like,

4728
02:09:09,650 --> 02:09:10,051
all right,

4729
02:09:10,051 --> 02:09:13,470
this is the best way we can replicate
this weird language that we were seeing.

4730
02:09:13,471 --> 02:09:14,370
I think that's what happened.

4731
02:09:14,371 --> 02:09:14,910
It could be,

4732
02:09:14,910 --> 02:09:15,730
but yeah,

4733
02:09:15,730 --> 02:09:19,380
the think did something that
produces like that effect.

4734
02:09:19,830 --> 02:09:24,830
There are people right now in federal
fucking penitentiaries right now laying in

4735
02:09:24,931 --> 02:09:29,310
a car in a federal penitentiary listening
to fucking white area and resistance

4736
02:09:29,311 --> 02:09:30,690
murderers jerking off.

4737
02:09:30,730 --> 02:09:31,650
Oh,

4738
02:09:32,580 --> 02:09:35,820
just because you wanted to fucking
see the mothership for a second.

4739
02:09:36,510 --> 02:09:39,780
You're three doors down from a
guy who fixed it as six year old.

4740
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:43,070
Fuck though.

4741
02:09:43,350 --> 02:09:44,610
How is that possible?

4742
02:09:45,270 --> 02:09:45,791
Well actually,

4743
02:09:45,791 --> 02:09:46,001
you know,

4744
02:09:46,001 --> 02:09:48,970
nonviolent drug offenders don't get
locked up in the same place as people at

4745
02:09:48,971 --> 02:09:49,781
fist six year olds.

4746
02:09:49,781 --> 02:09:50,630
But I know what you're saying.

4747
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:52,480
Just the fact that
they're in a cage at all.

4748
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:52,811
I mean,

4749
02:09:52,811 --> 02:09:54,340
maybe you do once you
get in there and they,

4750
02:09:54,341 --> 02:09:54,910
you know,

4751
02:09:54,910 --> 02:09:58,600
one of the fucking Hispanic guys wants a
fight with you and your stab him in the

4752
02:09:58,601 --> 02:09:59,390
neck and you know,

4753
02:09:59,390 --> 02:10:01,240
you want up getting a
murder wrap on top of it,

4754
02:10:01,270 --> 02:10:02,103
which happens.

4755
02:10:02,230 --> 02:10:03,880
Shit happens to nonviolent drug offenders.

4756
02:10:03,881 --> 02:10:05,620
They wind up getting much deeper,

4757
02:10:05,650 --> 02:10:06,150
uh,

4758
02:10:06,150 --> 02:10:06,340
uh,

4759
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:08,790
penalties for something they do
while they're actually in prison

4760
02:10:08,990 --> 02:10:10,640
to my friend got a Dui,

4761
02:10:10,820 --> 02:10:12,710
went to fucking county jail.

4762
02:10:12,890 --> 02:10:15,370
His jaw was broken within six minutes.

4763
02:10:15,390 --> 02:10:17,480
It was like a Saturday night
and they were gang bangers.

4764
02:10:17,481 --> 02:10:18,740
They're yet had to take a piss.

4765
02:10:18,950 --> 02:10:20,540
They wouldn't let him get to the toilet.

4766
02:10:20,900 --> 02:10:21,460
He's like,

4767
02:10:21,460 --> 02:10:22,810
I gotta Piss.

4768
02:10:23,180 --> 02:10:24,080
And they just were like,

4769
02:10:24,081 --> 02:10:24,914
what'd you say?

4770
02:10:24,980 --> 02:10:25,813
What?

4771
02:10:25,910 --> 02:10:29,180
Boom broke his fucking jaw for what?

4772
02:10:29,630 --> 02:10:33,200
Cause he fucking drove from
a club after one extra beer.

4773
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:37,460
That's insane for you shouldn't be
lumped up in the same group of people,

4774
02:10:37,461 --> 02:10:37,941
but you know,

4775
02:10:37,941 --> 02:10:38,391
then again,

4776
02:10:38,391 --> 02:10:41,570
what if your friend slammed into a
fucking car and killed someone's kid?

4777
02:10:41,900 --> 02:10:42,411
Well,

4778
02:10:42,411 --> 02:10:42,651
I mean,

4779
02:10:42,651 --> 02:10:45,230
obviously you don't know how drunk
he was and I'm just guessing.

4780
02:10:45,290 --> 02:10:46,340
But it's the same thing.

4781
02:10:46,830 --> 02:10:47,100
Yeah.

4782
02:10:47,100 --> 02:10:49,150
I knew she shouldn't
drive drunk and God knows,

4783
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:49,310
like,

4784
02:10:49,310 --> 02:10:51,050
I'm not saying he won't do that again.

4785
02:10:51,070 --> 02:10:51,341
All right.

4786
02:10:51,341 --> 02:10:52,310
Saying that's not the,

4787
02:10:52,330 --> 02:10:52,820
yeah,

4788
02:10:52,820 --> 02:10:53,720
well I don't know.

4789
02:10:53,930 --> 02:10:54,763
What'd you get raped?

4790
02:10:55,030 --> 02:10:55,970
He shouldn't have had that beer.

4791
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:56,271
Yeah,

4792
02:10:56,271 --> 02:10:57,350
that's what she get.

4793
02:10:57,470 --> 02:10:59,120
I guess that's what you get.

4794
02:10:59,540 --> 02:11:00,650
It's so fucked up,

4795
02:11:00,651 --> 02:11:00,891
man.

4796
02:11:00,891 --> 02:11:01,230
It's real.

4797
02:11:01,230 --> 02:11:02,060
I don't know.

4798
02:11:02,060 --> 02:11:04,250
I definitely think that people
should be penalized for,

4799
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:07,670
for putting other people in danger
because they're drunk and responsible,

4800
02:11:07,820 --> 02:11:09,450
but when it comes to
things like mushrooms,

4801
02:11:09,451 --> 02:11:11,840
which comes to psychedelic
experiences and,

4802
02:11:11,841 --> 02:11:16,100
and the idea that you can make any sort
of plant that grows here or fungus that

4803
02:11:16,101 --> 02:11:17,060
grows here naturally,

4804
02:11:17,230 --> 02:11:18,780
it's a part of the ecosystem already.

4805
02:11:18,830 --> 02:11:19,520
Way before,

4806
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:19,731
you know,

4807
02:11:19,731 --> 02:11:21,980
we invented this is fucking
completely ridiculous.

4808
02:11:22,070 --> 02:11:25,940
Especially when you look at all the stuff
that is legal and all the stuff that

4809
02:11:25,941 --> 02:11:28,340
can kill you and all this stuff
that you could buy at any store.

4810
02:11:28,430 --> 02:11:30,050
It's completely silly.

4811
02:11:30,260 --> 02:11:30,740
It's not,

4812
02:11:30,740 --> 02:11:32,090
there's no logic behind it.

4813
02:11:32,091 --> 02:11:34,250
It's not like this is
like a rational decision,

4814
02:11:34,251 --> 02:11:37,340
like you're obviously deciding
what I can and can't do.

4815
02:11:37,460 --> 02:11:40,280
You're deciding what kind of
experiences I have and you're,

4816
02:11:40,281 --> 02:11:41,360
there's no science behind it.

4817
02:11:41,361 --> 02:11:45,080
This is not 1950 you can't pull
some McCarthyism bullshit on me.

4818
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:46,430
I can get online and I can say,

4819
02:11:46,431 --> 02:11:46,761
well look,

4820
02:11:46,761 --> 02:11:48,170
no one's died from Silva Simon.

4821
02:11:48,320 --> 02:11:49,550
How come silicide means illegal?

4822
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:49,791
Well,

4823
02:11:49,791 --> 02:11:50,511
look here,

4824
02:11:50,511 --> 02:11:53,540
I can show you a thousand different
people that will tell you that.

4825
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:53,710
You know,

4826
02:11:53,710 --> 02:11:55,850
they've got over
posttraumatic stress disorder.

4827
02:11:55,940 --> 02:11:56,900
They've gotten over,

4828
02:11:56,901 --> 02:11:57,890
you know addiction's.

4829
02:11:57,891 --> 02:12:00,560
They've gotten over all these things
because of psychedelic experiences.

4830
02:12:00,770 --> 02:12:02,210
When you're telling me that it's illegal,

4831
02:12:02,300 --> 02:12:03,011
you're telling me that it's,

4832
02:12:03,011 --> 02:12:03,844
it's bad.

4833
02:12:03,860 --> 02:12:04,970
Why is it bad?

4834
02:12:05,450 --> 02:12:06,830
Here's the deal with anything.

4835
02:12:07,550 --> 02:12:12,550
Whenever there's something that people
can benefit from and people have all

4836
02:12:13,791 --> 02:12:15,470
these stories about and people,

4837
02:12:15,471 --> 02:12:15,741
there's,

4838
02:12:15,741 --> 02:12:15,980
there's,

4839
02:12:15,980 --> 02:12:20,900
there's an area to explore and someone's
keeping you from doing that and trying

4840
02:12:20,901 --> 02:12:22,430
to lock you in jail.

4841
02:12:22,460 --> 02:12:23,960
If you do do that,

4842
02:12:24,110 --> 02:12:25,960
they're the fucking criminal.

4843
02:12:25,970 --> 02:12:26,630
The monsters.

4844
02:12:26,630 --> 02:12:27,770
They're the monsters.

4845
02:12:27,771 --> 02:12:30,710
They are the fucking
criminals of the human race.

4846
02:12:31,040 --> 02:12:31,700
You or point,

4847
02:12:31,700 --> 02:12:34,040
you were putting a crime on people.

4848
02:12:34,190 --> 02:12:37,250
You are literally stopping
people from evolving.

4849
02:12:37,270 --> 02:12:38,103
Yup.

4850
02:12:38,300 --> 02:12:38,650
That it,

4851
02:12:38,650 --> 02:12:40,280
the fucking demon stopped doing it.

4852
02:12:40,281 --> 02:12:41,114
Dunkin.

4853
02:12:41,390 --> 02:12:43,430
I like to put people in jail.

4854
02:12:43,880 --> 02:12:45,800
Dunkin's all about constricting.

4855
02:12:46,340 --> 02:12:47,001
I love it.

4856
02:12:47,001 --> 02:12:50,300
There's nothing I love more than
having a mushroom addict in the back.

4857
02:12:50,540 --> 02:12:51,620
We're going to have to explore it.

4858
02:12:51,621 --> 02:12:54,980
Ball gags and whips
someday with you diapers.

4859
02:12:55,170 --> 02:12:56,003
You remember why the F

4860
02:12:57,560 --> 02:12:58,900
do you remember coming up and saying that?

4861
02:12:59,930 --> 02:13:00,920
That's hilarious.

4862
02:13:01,310 --> 02:13:02,320
Ball gags dog.

4863
02:13:02,321 --> 02:13:02,480
Right?

4864
02:13:02,480 --> 02:13:02,960
Just kidding.

4865
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:03,610
I won't say,

4866
02:13:03,610 --> 02:13:04,010
Hey,

4867
02:13:04,010 --> 02:13:04,660
I,

4868
02:13:04,660 --> 02:13:06,250
we talked to Steve o today and he,

4869
02:13:06,251 --> 02:13:07,660
he's completely sober now.

4870
02:13:07,661 --> 02:13:09,670
He stopped smoking cigarettes.

4871
02:13:09,671 --> 02:13:10,451
Stop drinking.

4872
02:13:10,451 --> 02:13:10,781
He was doing,

4873
02:13:10,781 --> 02:13:13,540
he said he was doing so much drugs
the last couple of years of his life.

4874
02:13:13,541 --> 02:13:16,300
There was people walking around
his house that didn't exist.

4875
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:17,620
That's how bad it got,

4876
02:13:17,950 --> 02:13:21,670
but now he just quit everything in and
now is Vegan and isn't that crazy to you

4877
02:13:21,671 --> 02:13:24,850
to think that that somebody
that gets an a toit was shit,

4878
02:13:24,851 --> 02:13:26,110
it's still concerned about his health,

4879
02:13:26,111 --> 02:13:28,260
that he's eating Vegan
and not on anything?

4880
02:13:28,340 --> 02:13:28,551
Well,

4881
02:13:28,551 --> 02:13:28,821
yes,

4882
02:13:28,821 --> 02:13:32,040
he's probably realizing how
silly his life was and he's like,

4883
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:32,341
you know,

4884
02:13:32,341 --> 02:13:33,750
putting himself back in line.

4885
02:13:33,751 --> 02:13:34,021
It's like,

4886
02:13:34,021 --> 02:13:38,520
but what's the logical step to put
yourself as far in line as you can and go

4887
02:13:38,521 --> 02:13:39,690
vegetarian and Vegan.

4888
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:42,510
There's a guy named John Fitch that
fought and this last UFC and he went,

4889
02:13:42,511 --> 02:13:44,520
he had a Vegan diet and I
thought was really interesting.

4890
02:13:44,540 --> 02:13:45,450
I wanted to see how he,

4891
02:13:45,451 --> 02:13:47,460
did he want to win and you beat Bj Penn?

4892
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:48,001
It was sort of,

4893
02:13:48,001 --> 02:13:48,181
no,

4894
02:13:48,181 --> 02:13:49,500
I'm sorry it didn't beat Bj Penn.

4895
02:13:49,740 --> 02:13:50,573
He was a draw,

4896
02:13:50,640 --> 02:13:51,160
but he won.

4897
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:53,520
The final round is cardio was really good.

4898
02:13:53,521 --> 02:13:54,241
It was really solid.

4899
02:13:54,241 --> 02:13:54,870
He was talking to miles.

4900
02:13:54,870 --> 02:13:56,340
Cardio is like off the charts now,

4901
02:13:56,580 --> 02:13:56,881
you know.

4902
02:13:56,881 --> 02:14:00,030
But the [inaudible] they
just have to refight.

4903
02:14:00,450 --> 02:14:01,230
I don't know.

4904
02:14:01,230 --> 02:14:02,670
They have to decide now.

4905
02:14:02,730 --> 02:14:04,140
They have to figure out
what the fuck to do,

4906
02:14:04,440 --> 02:14:04,930
you know,

4907
02:14:04,930 --> 02:14:05,520
because uh,

4908
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:07,950
this was for the number one
contender spot and you know,

4909
02:14:07,951 --> 02:14:08,910
fish is still pushing,

4910
02:14:08,911 --> 02:14:09,151
you know,

4911
02:14:09,151 --> 02:14:10,200
after the post fight interview,

4912
02:14:10,201 --> 02:14:10,831
his coach was like,

4913
02:14:10,831 --> 02:14:11,131
you know,

4914
02:14:11,131 --> 02:14:12,410
ask for a title shot ever been.

4915
02:14:12,410 --> 02:14:12,721
And I'm like,

4916
02:14:12,721 --> 02:14:13,410
mom,

4917
02:14:13,410 --> 02:14:15,540
you can't ask for a title shot
after you get off of a draw.

4918
02:14:15,541 --> 02:14:16,830
It's just like too tough to sell.

4919
02:14:16,831 --> 02:14:18,480
What did you think was
going on with that fight?

4920
02:14:18,481 --> 02:14:21,600
Who Do you think draw could be a expected?

4921
02:14:21,680 --> 02:14:22,530
Depends on how you score.

4922
02:14:22,531 --> 02:14:23,180
The third round,

4923
02:14:23,180 --> 02:14:26,820
the third round was pretty decisive
victory for Fitch and some people thought

4924
02:14:26,821 --> 02:14:27,780
that was a ten eight round.

4925
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:28,151
You know,

4926
02:14:28,151 --> 02:14:29,040
I'm not really,

4927
02:14:29,850 --> 02:14:33,000
it depends on how you use ten eight
rounds because I the the ten eight round,

4928
02:14:33,001 --> 02:14:34,020
the system that they use now,

4929
02:14:34,060 --> 02:14:36,360
I think it's like they don't
give out enough ten eight rounds,

4930
02:14:36,510 --> 02:14:39,050
but you have to decide when is it a ten
eight round when you're inside a guys

4931
02:14:39,060 --> 02:14:41,430
guard and he just punched him
to the body into the head.

4932
02:14:41,670 --> 02:14:42,960
I'm not sure if that's a ten eight round.

4933
02:14:42,990 --> 02:14:43,830
I could see it argued.

4934
02:14:44,130 --> 02:14:44,641
But Bj,

4935
02:14:44,641 --> 02:14:46,660
I thought one the first
two rounds because then,

4936
02:14:46,700 --> 02:14:47,940
but those were very close to,

4937
02:14:47,941 --> 02:14:50,080
I could see it argued
that pitched it to um,

4938
02:14:50,690 --> 02:14:51,151
Fitch one,

4939
02:14:51,151 --> 02:14:52,410
one of them because um,

4940
02:14:52,530 --> 02:14:52,861
you know,

4941
02:14:52,861 --> 02:14:53,850
Bj got his back,

4942
02:14:53,851 --> 02:14:54,690
PJ took them down,

4943
02:14:54,691 --> 02:14:55,441
Bj got us back,

4944
02:14:55,441 --> 02:14:57,450
but then he lost position
and Fitch got on top of them.

4945
02:14:57,870 --> 02:14:59,080
So the question is like,

4946
02:14:59,130 --> 02:14:59,311
well,

4947
02:14:59,311 --> 02:15:00,000
what is,

4948
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:00,900
what's worth more?

4949
02:15:00,901 --> 02:15:03,870
Is it worth more to take a guy down and
to get a dominant position where you're

4950
02:15:03,871 --> 02:15:07,260
close to finishing a fight but then
losing it and getting reversed and wind up

4951
02:15:07,261 --> 02:15:09,810
being your guard with the guy
on top of you throwing punches.

4952
02:15:10,510 --> 02:15:13,200
Is that better or is it
better to take the guy's back?

4953
02:15:13,201 --> 02:15:14,430
What's worth more on points?

4954
02:15:14,431 --> 02:15:14,521
Well,

4955
02:15:14,521 --> 02:15:15,600
that's a subjective thing,

4956
02:15:15,601 --> 02:15:15,721
you know,

4957
02:15:15,721 --> 02:15:16,554
so it's tricky.

4958
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:17,550
I could see that.

4959
02:15:17,550 --> 02:15:20,520
I could see the first two rounds
score for Bj and I could see,

4960
02:15:20,820 --> 02:15:23,840
I could see someone scoring one of
them for Fitch and I can also see the,

4961
02:15:23,841 --> 02:15:24,391
the second,

4962
02:15:24,391 --> 02:15:27,240
the third round rather being
ten eight so I could see a draw.

4963
02:15:27,270 --> 02:15:29,070
We were split two and
when we were watching it,

4964
02:15:29,220 --> 02:15:29,820
watching it,

4965
02:15:29,820 --> 02:15:30,690
it's tricky man.

4966
02:15:30,720 --> 02:15:31,260
It's tricky.

4967
02:15:31,260 --> 02:15:32,610
Mean Bj is a bad motherfucker,

4968
02:15:32,611 --> 02:15:33,040
but he's,

4969
02:15:33,040 --> 02:15:34,560
he's small for that weight class.

4970
02:15:34,830 --> 02:15:35,611
You know when he's fighting,

4971
02:15:35,611 --> 02:15:39,390
he's weighing one 66 with his pants
on and he's fighting Fitch who,

4972
02:15:39,391 --> 02:15:40,460
but this is the thing about Fitch.

4973
02:15:40,510 --> 02:15:41,400
The reason why I brought this up,

4974
02:15:41,430 --> 02:15:42,480
he was at one point in time,

4975
02:15:42,481 --> 02:15:43,400
like 200 pounds,

4976
02:15:43,410 --> 02:15:46,890
he would cut down to one 70 but now
he's like all organic and Vegan and he's

4977
02:15:46,891 --> 02:15:51,030
wearing around one 80 which is really
light for him and then dropping a little

4978
02:15:51,031 --> 02:15:53,040
weight but it's cardio is
like way better now too.

4979
02:15:53,430 --> 02:15:57,150
I've entertained trying like a
serious vegan diet for a while,

4980
02:15:57,720 --> 02:16:01,890
but you know I heard like Travis Barker
after he crashed in that plane and he

4981
02:16:01,891 --> 02:16:03,480
had to get skin grafts and shit like that.

4982
02:16:03,570 --> 02:16:07,980
They didn't take until he started eating
meat and he like stopped being a Vegan

4983
02:16:07,981 --> 02:16:09,740
in his recovery from that again,

4984
02:16:09,741 --> 02:16:10,080
he was a,

4985
02:16:10,080 --> 02:16:13,230
he was a Vegan before that and then you
know when he started eating red meat

4986
02:16:13,350 --> 02:16:16,230
then all of a sudden like his
healing like went through the roof.

4987
02:16:16,231 --> 02:16:19,890
Whenever I eat vegan food
and a Vegan restaurant,

4988
02:16:20,460 --> 02:16:21,480
I fucking love it.

4989
02:16:21,720 --> 02:16:22,553
Swingers.

4990
02:16:22,620 --> 02:16:24,450
I could make this myself.

4991
02:16:24,630 --> 02:16:25,530
I wouldn't want to,

4992
02:16:25,620 --> 02:16:26,360
I wouldn't care about,

4993
02:16:26,360 --> 02:16:27,660
well you could make it yourself easily.

4994
02:16:27,780 --> 02:16:29,130
It's a pain in the ass.

4995
02:16:29,170 --> 02:16:29,900
Pain in the ass.

4996
02:16:29,900 --> 02:16:30,010
I

4997
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:31,720
could be wrong with our friend.

4998
02:16:31,721 --> 02:16:35,740
When when I dated her it was like having
to go to certain restaurants having to

4999
02:16:35,741 --> 02:16:37,120
do all this bullshit.

5000
02:16:37,150 --> 02:16:38,620
She's not even a Vegan anymore now.

5001
02:16:39,220 --> 02:16:39,610
Yeah.

5002
02:16:39,610 --> 02:16:41,290
She eats Vegan here and there but she's,

5003
02:16:41,291 --> 02:16:44,260
she gets me just fucking
filled with hormones right now.

5004
02:16:44,261 --> 02:16:45,160
Is it mostly just kidding?

5005
02:16:45,570 --> 02:16:46,260
Some meters?

5006
02:16:46,260 --> 02:16:46,590
Yeah.

5007
02:16:46,590 --> 02:16:46,950
Yeah.

5008
02:16:46,950 --> 02:16:48,090
It depends on where you're getting it.

5009
02:16:48,120 --> 02:16:48,641
Free Range.

5010
02:16:48,641 --> 02:16:49,321
You want free range,

5011
02:16:49,321 --> 02:16:51,570
organic meat and that
you want grass fed too.

5012
02:16:51,571 --> 02:16:52,061
I like gray.

5013
02:16:52,061 --> 02:16:55,390
I prefer the taste of grass fed is a
discussion that Ari and I actually had on

5014
02:16:55,391 --> 02:16:56,460
the podcast on a plane.

5015
02:16:56,760 --> 02:16:57,091
The A,

5016
02:16:57,091 --> 02:16:59,460
the difference between grass
fed and grain fed beef.

5017
02:16:59,490 --> 02:17:00,450
Beef is not,

5018
02:17:00,480 --> 02:17:02,310
it's not natural for
them to beat and grain.

5019
02:17:02,490 --> 02:17:03,570
They're not supposed to eat corn.

5020
02:17:03,690 --> 02:17:06,150
We give them corn because
it makes them fat as fuck,

5021
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:09,180
which makes the meat so delicious and
tender when you cook it because there's

5022
02:17:09,181 --> 02:17:11,850
all this fat bubbling up
inside of it and you know,

5023
02:17:11,851 --> 02:17:13,560
and melting and it just gets awesome.

5024
02:17:13,561 --> 02:17:16,470
Like a big fat fucking grain fed steak.

5025
02:17:16,471 --> 02:17:16,681
You know,

5026
02:17:16,681 --> 02:17:18,510
it's just so just melts in your mouth.

5027
02:17:18,780 --> 02:17:21,150
But the reality is they're
supposed to be eating grass.

5028
02:17:21,150 --> 02:17:21,561
And when you,

5029
02:17:21,561 --> 02:17:23,220
you taste grass fed beef,

5030
02:17:23,221 --> 02:17:24,930
it has a distinctly different flavor.

5031
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:25,913
I prefer it,

5032
02:17:26,550 --> 02:17:27,450
but I like game.

5033
02:17:27,690 --> 02:17:28,261
I like eating.

5034
02:17:28,261 --> 02:17:28,820
Like I like,

5035
02:17:28,820 --> 02:17:30,150
I like venison and elk.

5036
02:17:30,240 --> 02:17:31,620
I like eating like those meets,

5037
02:17:31,621 --> 02:17:33,420
I have my theories about that shit.

5038
02:17:33,660 --> 02:17:37,170
I feel like anything that's tough
to catch is easy or tough to catch,

5039
02:17:37,171 --> 02:17:39,960
whether is really good for you
and things that are easy to catch.

5040
02:17:39,961 --> 02:17:40,530
Like cows,

5041
02:17:40,530 --> 02:17:41,590
you can just walk right up to account,

5042
02:17:41,610 --> 02:17:42,690
shoot him in the fucking head.

5043
02:17:42,930 --> 02:17:43,763
They're stupid.

5044
02:17:43,830 --> 02:17:44,370
You know,

5045
02:17:44,370 --> 02:17:47,970
like you'll shoot account ahead and a cow
right next to him alert and he doesn't

5046
02:17:47,971 --> 02:17:49,590
even freak out and go holy fuck.

5047
02:17:49,770 --> 02:17:51,150
But like you try to shoot a pig,

5048
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:52,580
pigs will run from you.

5049
02:17:52,581 --> 02:17:52,950
Man.

5050
02:17:52,950 --> 02:17:53,251
Pigs,

5051
02:17:53,251 --> 02:17:53,730
you know like,

5052
02:17:53,730 --> 02:17:55,380
and wild pigs like wild boar.

5053
02:17:55,440 --> 02:17:56,273
Very good for you.

5054
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:58,770
How's her fucking sweet creatures?

5055
02:17:59,040 --> 02:17:59,460
Yeah,

5056
02:17:59,460 --> 02:17:59,840
well they're,

5057
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:00,690
they're cows.

5058
02:18:00,810 --> 02:18:01,860
There's their cattle,

5059
02:18:02,310 --> 02:18:02,641
you know,

5060
02:18:02,641 --> 02:18:05,550
I mean the idea of cattle
like being like at our mercy,

5061
02:18:05,790 --> 02:18:06,061
you know,

5062
02:18:06,061 --> 02:18:06,270
like,

5063
02:18:06,270 --> 02:18:06,770
like

5064
02:18:06,770 --> 02:18:07,050
no,

5065
02:18:07,050 --> 02:18:07,800
they're like,

5066
02:18:07,800 --> 02:18:08,340
they're like,

5067
02:18:08,340 --> 02:18:10,740
you know like in India how
like they worship cows.

5068
02:18:11,150 --> 02:18:15,180
So in India like in the streets or these
cows that have just been being petted

5069
02:18:15,181 --> 02:18:17,010
by people like dogs,

5070
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:19,710
they are fucking sweet.

5071
02:18:19,770 --> 02:18:20,310
Don't you think?

5072
02:18:20,310 --> 02:18:20,460
No,

5073
02:18:20,460 --> 02:18:20,630
the,

5074
02:18:20,630 --> 02:18:25,260
that docile behavior has been engineered
through three years of breeding for,

5075
02:18:25,470 --> 02:18:26,281
for them to be,

5076
02:18:26,281 --> 02:18:26,491
you know,

5077
02:18:26,491 --> 02:18:30,960
farm animals for them to be used while
be so unnatural thing for people to just

5078
02:18:30,961 --> 02:18:32,790
walk right up to an animal
and be able to pet it.

5079
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:34,170
People are creepy fucks,

5080
02:18:34,470 --> 02:18:34,740
you know?

5081
02:18:34,740 --> 02:18:37,770
I mean you have to engineer
an animal to be that docile,

5082
02:18:37,890 --> 02:18:38,131
you know,

5083
02:18:38,131 --> 02:18:42,060
like how long relationship
with humans for sure.

5084
02:18:42,061 --> 02:18:42,360
Yeah.

5085
02:18:42,360 --> 02:18:44,370
Wild cows and shit like that.

5086
02:18:44,371 --> 02:18:45,540
They don't have that sort of,

5087
02:18:45,541 --> 02:18:46,950
I mean there's other wild cows.

5088
02:18:46,951 --> 02:18:48,060
What the fuck am I doing here guys?

5089
02:18:48,480 --> 02:18:50,670
There must've been at some point
in time it must've been a wild,

5090
02:18:50,671 --> 02:18:51,810
there still is what?

5091
02:18:51,811 --> 02:18:52,650
Cows are so valuable.

5092
02:18:52,651 --> 02:18:53,640
Very few of them are wild,

5093
02:18:53,650 --> 02:18:54,210
right?

5094
02:18:54,210 --> 02:18:54,481
No,

5095
02:18:54,481 --> 02:18:54,870
no.

5096
02:18:54,870 --> 02:18:55,680
Catherine valuable.

5097
02:18:55,680 --> 02:18:56,550
Are they like,

5098
02:18:56,551 --> 02:18:58,860
is there like weight or
styles are very valuable,

5099
02:18:58,910 --> 02:19:00,900
really a lot of money
that's worth a lot of money.

5100
02:19:00,990 --> 02:19:01,351
Of course,

5101
02:19:01,351 --> 02:19:01,570
man,

5102
02:19:01,570 --> 02:19:04,140
steak cows are a dime a dozen much.

5103
02:19:04,141 --> 02:19:05,430
Would it cost to buy a cow?

5104
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:06,360
It's a good question.

5105
02:19:06,360 --> 02:19:07,193
I think.

5106
02:19:07,290 --> 02:19:07,861
Look it up,

5107
02:19:07,861 --> 02:19:08,370
man.

5108
02:19:08,370 --> 02:19:09,031
Love to do that,

5109
02:19:09,031 --> 02:19:09,211
man.

5110
02:19:09,211 --> 02:19:12,870
I would love to have my own farm someday
and just have animals that you know,

5111
02:19:12,871 --> 02:19:14,220
you know what they're feeding.

5112
02:19:14,250 --> 02:19:15,120
You know what you're feeding them,

5113
02:19:15,121 --> 02:19:15,420
rather,

5114
02:19:15,420 --> 02:19:16,890
you know if you're going to eat them,

5115
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:18,330
you know how they're treated.

5116
02:19:18,331 --> 02:19:19,440
You know that it's all humane

5117
02:19:19,770 --> 02:19:19,980
dude.

5118
02:19:19,980 --> 02:19:21,000
I think about that.

5119
02:19:21,001 --> 02:19:21,330
My,

5120
02:19:21,330 --> 02:19:23,250
that my dream idea of that,

5121
02:19:23,251 --> 02:19:28,251
which is like this crazy plays
out in the woods with solar panels

5122
02:19:28,730 --> 02:19:32,990
where where the majority of
your electricity or all of
it is coming from the sun

5123
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:36,380
and you're feeding yourself from
this place that's feasible here.

5124
02:19:36,470 --> 02:19:36,711
Yeah,

5125
02:19:36,711 --> 02:19:37,371
it's feasible,

5126
02:19:37,371 --> 02:19:41,060
but it's like so like so
much work to run a farm.

5127
02:19:41,061 --> 02:19:42,140
It's insane.

5128
02:19:42,500 --> 02:19:47,270
It's not like either or either you have
like people working for you and doing it

5129
02:19:47,510 --> 02:19:48,800
or if you're involved in it,

5130
02:19:48,801 --> 02:19:49,161
you're just,

5131
02:19:49,161 --> 02:19:50,120
there's no stairs.

5132
02:19:50,150 --> 02:19:53,150
You just work all day and sleep and
you wake up and work all day and sleep.

5133
02:19:53,250 --> 02:19:53,640
Yeah,

5134
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:53,880
you,

5135
02:19:53,880 --> 02:19:54,181
you,

5136
02:19:54,181 --> 02:19:54,780
you bud.

5137
02:19:54,780 --> 02:19:55,920
You can be self sustaining,

5138
02:19:55,921 --> 02:19:56,581
which is very,

5139
02:19:56,581 --> 02:19:56,791
you know,

5140
02:19:56,791 --> 02:19:57,850
rewarding for a lot of pieces.

5141
02:19:57,860 --> 02:19:58,160
That idea.

5142
02:19:58,160 --> 02:19:59,580
Ideally you grow all your own food,

5143
02:19:59,581 --> 02:20:02,340
grow your own vegetables and you
grow your own animals as well.

5144
02:20:02,670 --> 02:20:03,091
But yeah,

5145
02:20:03,091 --> 02:20:04,470
you could hire a few people to,

5146
02:20:04,471 --> 02:20:07,440
to run at me if you just wanted
a farm only for your families.

5147
02:20:07,470 --> 02:20:08,303
Sustenance.

5148
02:20:08,520 --> 02:20:08,791
You know,

5149
02:20:08,791 --> 02:20:10,290
that's kind of an interesting theory.

5150
02:20:10,440 --> 02:20:10,680
You know,

5151
02:20:10,680 --> 02:20:11,650
an interesting sort of a,

5152
02:20:11,651 --> 02:20:12,660
a concept,

5153
02:20:12,661 --> 02:20:12,901
you know,

5154
02:20:12,901 --> 02:20:16,620
set up a farm where all the vegetables
that you grow or vegetables that you eat

5155
02:20:16,621 --> 02:20:19,770
and then I guess you know
in the wintertime you can
them or something or you

5156
02:20:19,771 --> 02:20:21,840
have a greenhouse or
something you can't know.

5157
02:20:22,320 --> 02:20:23,700
Cows are about a thousand bucks,

5158
02:20:23,730 --> 02:20:24,730
1000 bucks for a cow.

5159
02:20:24,770 --> 02:20:25,300
So,

5160
02:20:25,300 --> 02:20:27,910
so it's a bargain and what
all the meat on that thing,

5161
02:20:27,911 --> 02:20:32,550
either by two cows or buy the new Mac
book out fucking new Mac book all the way

5162
02:20:32,790 --> 02:20:36,540
you guys lose and on this cause
you guys are fucking goofy.

5163
02:20:36,541 --> 02:20:39,660
Mac heads as our mind
iPad two and two days.

5164
02:20:39,690 --> 02:20:41,610
What is the nude was the
deal with these Mac books?

5165
02:20:41,611 --> 02:20:42,444
He goes,

5166
02:20:43,220 --> 02:20:44,130
they look amazing.

5167
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:44,410
Well,

5168
02:20:44,410 --> 02:20:46,040
the biggest thing is the new technology,

5169
02:20:46,060 --> 02:20:47,220
the thunderbolt technology,

5170
02:20:47,221 --> 02:20:50,760
which is like 10 gigabytes per second.

5171
02:20:50,761 --> 02:20:51,594
The ball.

5172
02:20:51,650 --> 02:20:52,360
This is a phone call,

5173
02:20:52,360 --> 02:20:52,990
the thunderbolt two,

5174
02:20:52,990 --> 02:20:53,310
the child,

5175
02:20:53,310 --> 02:20:54,143
now that

5176
02:20:56,250 --> 02:20:57,750
it's 10 gigabytes per second.

5177
02:20:57,751 --> 02:21:00,960
So what that means is live like you're
pretty much going to be able to hook up

5178
02:21:00,961 --> 02:21:05,961
an external hard drive and edit HD video
easily and run multiple streams of,

5179
02:21:06,360 --> 02:21:06,631
you know,

5180
02:21:06,631 --> 02:21:10,530
it's going to help editing video editing
and transferring files nowadays when

5181
02:21:10,531 --> 02:21:13,140
you went to backup your
computer 10 gigabytes a second,

5182
02:21:13,141 --> 02:21:13,860
come on.

5183
02:21:13,860 --> 02:21:14,460
That's credible.

5184
02:21:14,460 --> 02:21:15,293
Insane.

5185
02:21:15,810 --> 02:21:17,760
And it has HD video cameras now.

5186
02:21:18,360 --> 02:21:20,370
Also bigger solid state
drive you can get up to,

5187
02:21:20,371 --> 02:21:20,821
what was it?

5188
02:21:20,821 --> 02:21:23,210
Everybody 50 thank you.

5189
02:21:23,270 --> 02:21:24,550
Got sponsored by Mack.

5190
02:21:24,600 --> 02:21:24,840
Well,

5191
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:26,240
well they already do.

5192
02:21:26,660 --> 02:21:29,520
We use laptops that have
the big apple logo on.

5193
02:21:29,521 --> 02:21:31,710
It was like one of the
[inaudible] tried to sponsor us.

5194
02:21:31,711 --> 02:21:33,950
It was like asking like this apple boom,

5195
02:21:33,980 --> 02:21:34,980
you guys drove up a lot.

5196
02:21:35,030 --> 02:21:36,840
I wish apple please sponsor us.

5197
02:21:36,841 --> 02:21:38,220
But it was like quad cores.

5198
02:21:38,880 --> 02:21:42,690
That's 50 times faster than
the last last bit of Mac books.

5199
02:21:42,720 --> 02:21:43,620
50 Times.

5200
02:21:43,621 --> 02:21:43,771
Yeah.

5201
02:21:43,771 --> 02:21:47,490
And some of the early benchmarks are
showing anywhere from the 13 inch model

5202
02:21:47,491 --> 02:21:49,110
being about 12% faster.

5203
02:21:49,111 --> 02:21:51,720
Two to up to 53% faster.

5204
02:21:51,960 --> 02:21:52,200
Oh,

5205
02:21:52,200 --> 02:21:52,381
okay.

5206
02:21:52,381 --> 02:21:54,000
That's not 50 times.

5207
02:21:54,490 --> 02:21:54,840
I'm sorry.

5208
02:21:54,840 --> 02:21:56,910
50% 50% percent.

5209
02:21:56,911 --> 02:21:57,500
Sorry.

5210
02:21:57,500 --> 02:21:58,333
Jesus,

5211
02:21:58,840 --> 02:21:59,673
Quad Core,

5212
02:21:59,820 --> 02:22:00,930
double core quad core.

5213
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:01,800
That's pretty interesting.

5214
02:22:02,420 --> 02:22:05,160
So that would be what you would need if
you were doing video rendering and shit

5215
02:22:05,161 --> 02:22:05,521
like that.

5216
02:22:05,521 --> 02:22:06,301
But for most people,

5217
02:22:06,301 --> 02:22:07,020
what the fuck?

5218
02:22:07,020 --> 02:22:09,870
It was just a matter of transferring even,

5219
02:22:09,900 --> 02:22:10,141
I mean,

5220
02:22:10,141 --> 02:22:10,921
have you noticed even,

5221
02:22:10,921 --> 02:22:11,880
I don't know on your laptop,

5222
02:22:11,881 --> 02:22:15,690
but I know that this one like fucking
youtube or youtube videos or any kind of

5223
02:22:15,691 --> 02:22:17,670
HD video still is struggling.

5224
02:22:17,671 --> 02:22:19,680
Even though this is a pretty fast laptop,

5225
02:22:19,920 --> 02:22:20,680
it's still struggles.

5226
02:22:20,680 --> 02:22:21,660
So the graphics card,

5227
02:22:21,661 --> 02:22:21,930
right.

5228
02:22:21,930 --> 02:22:26,160
So it's mostly the graphics card
and in just the fucking flash and

5229
02:22:26,310 --> 02:22:30,210
the video card that needs new ones have
video cards up to one gigabyte now,

5230
02:22:30,240 --> 02:22:31,110
which is crazy.

5231
02:22:31,111 --> 02:22:32,550
And the switch from the video,

5232
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:35,460
which has been having a lot of
problems with the Mac books lately,

5233
02:22:35,690 --> 02:22:35,971
uh,

5234
02:22:35,971 --> 02:22:38,190
with an overheating
and problems with them.

5235
02:22:38,370 --> 02:22:39,840
Now they switched back to a,

5236
02:22:39,850 --> 02:22:40,683
a AMD or,

5237
02:22:40,710 --> 02:22:41,190
or whatever.

5238
02:22:41,190 --> 02:22:44,790
So this is interesting to me is
exciting but not that exciting.

5239
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:45,960
I need some new shit.

5240
02:22:45,990 --> 02:22:46,291
I need,

5241
02:22:46,291 --> 02:22:47,550
I need some next level shit.

5242
02:22:48,750 --> 02:22:50,490
This transferring gigabytes real quick.

5243
02:22:50,491 --> 02:22:51,660
That's all good and everything like that.

5244
02:22:51,661 --> 02:22:54,450
But what is the next thing that a fucking
computer's going to do that's really

5245
02:22:54,451 --> 02:22:55,290
going to blow you away?

5246
02:22:55,420 --> 02:22:56,430
That's going to do that?

5247
02:22:56,520 --> 02:22:59,210
I think if we're going more
towards tablet more for Jackson,

5248
02:22:59,340 --> 02:23:00,090
quantum computing,

5249
02:23:00,090 --> 02:23:00,250
no,

5250
02:23:00,250 --> 02:23:01,110
it's that fucking,

5251
02:23:01,111 --> 02:23:01,800
um,

5252
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:04,800
the computer that just
beat people at jeopardy.

5253
02:23:04,801 --> 02:23:05,634
Yeah,

5254
02:23:05,850 --> 02:23:06,121
no,

5255
02:23:06,121 --> 02:23:06,954
seriously.

5256
02:23:07,050 --> 02:23:07,320
You know,

5257
02:23:07,320 --> 02:23:11,700
it used to be like a computer that could
play chess and beat people was a big

5258
02:23:11,701 --> 02:23:12,450
deal.

5259
02:23:12,450 --> 02:23:15,090
Now everyone has a computer
that can be you at chess,

5260
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:15,281
right?

5261
02:23:15,281 --> 02:23:15,841
Eventually.

5262
02:23:15,841 --> 02:23:20,220
Like the next thing you're talking about
is like interactive surfaces where you

5263
02:23:20,221 --> 02:23:21,870
tell it exactly what you want.

5264
02:23:21,871 --> 02:23:25,230
I'm actually more excited about this
iPad to announcement March 2nd which is

5265
02:23:25,231 --> 02:23:28,490
supposedly going to have cameras
in the front and back pretty soon.

5266
02:23:28,491 --> 02:23:31,650
That's going to change the whole thing
with being able to do facetime and

5267
02:23:31,651 --> 02:23:32,580
watching you stream.

5268
02:23:32,581 --> 02:23:33,900
Now you can be able to
use string from your team.

5269
02:23:33,970 --> 02:23:34,360
Hi Pat,

5270
02:23:34,360 --> 02:23:34,810
this is,

5271
02:23:34,810 --> 02:23:37,390
this is what's really
trippy quantum computing.

5272
02:23:37,570 --> 02:23:41,860
That's the really weird shit because
first of all try to wrap your head around

5273
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:44,380
what a quantum computer really is.

5274
02:23:44,590 --> 02:23:48,190
You have to really kind of understand
what the idea behind quantum mechanics and

5275
02:23:48,430 --> 02:23:49,690
what it basically is is a,

5276
02:23:49,691 --> 02:23:51,820
this is how it's listed in Wikipedia.

5277
02:23:52,060 --> 02:23:55,900
A device for computation that makes
direct use of quantum mechanical phenomena

5278
02:23:55,901 --> 02:23:58,360
such as super position and entanglement.

5279
02:23:58,570 --> 02:23:59,470
And if you don't know what that means,

5280
02:23:59,471 --> 02:24:03,490
superposition means that an object can
be both moving and still at the same

5281
02:24:03,491 --> 02:24:04,120
time.

5282
02:24:04,120 --> 02:24:04,670
I mean the,

5283
02:24:04,670 --> 02:24:05,180
the,

5284
02:24:05,180 --> 02:24:09,190
the idea of quantum mechanics you get
into like that's weird Voodoo Shit.

5285
02:24:09,340 --> 02:24:13,300
Things that particles that subatomic
particles at blink in and out of existence

5286
02:24:13,301 --> 02:24:14,230
and the idea of,

5287
02:24:14,380 --> 02:24:14,591
you know,

5288
02:24:14,591 --> 02:24:16,630
it being able to be effected by the user.

5289
02:24:16,631 --> 02:24:18,400
I mean those are all
quantum mechanical ideas,

5290
02:24:18,920 --> 02:24:22,640
quantum entanglement because that
really is Voodoo shit that's like,

5291
02:24:22,670 --> 02:24:27,410
that's a computer quantum
entanglement is as I understand it,

5292
02:24:27,411 --> 02:24:31,310
is the idea that if you take two particles
and put them together and then move

5293
02:24:31,311 --> 02:24:32,144
them apart,

5294
02:24:32,180 --> 02:24:32,541
right.

5295
02:24:32,541 --> 02:24:36,770
They still are somehow connected and
you can transfer information down that

5296
02:24:36,771 --> 02:24:37,210
line.

5297
02:24:37,210 --> 02:24:38,800
It's one of those things
where I talk about it.

5298
02:24:38,830 --> 02:24:40,960
I say what I've heard said,

5299
02:24:41,260 --> 02:24:43,210
but I don't know what it means.

5300
02:24:43,270 --> 02:24:43,460
Yeah.

5301
02:24:43,460 --> 02:24:43,931
You know what I mean?

5302
02:24:43,931 --> 02:24:46,870
Like I'm talking about super positions
and I'm talking about entanglement and

5303
02:24:46,871 --> 02:24:47,860
I'm saying all those things,

5304
02:24:48,100 --> 02:24:48,770
but I mean what,

5305
02:24:48,770 --> 02:24:49,090
what,

5306
02:24:49,090 --> 02:24:49,720
you know,

5307
02:24:49,720 --> 02:24:52,270
all I'm doing is making the
right noises with my mouth.

5308
02:24:52,710 --> 02:24:53,140
You know,

5309
02:24:53,140 --> 02:24:57,000
my brain barely makes the connection
to what the fuck that screw the mind.

5310
02:24:57,001 --> 02:24:57,380
Yeah.

5311
02:24:57,380 --> 02:25:01,670
Connection is just this rudimentary thing
where I think of like to round things

5312
02:25:01,671 --> 02:25:05,660
that have what appear to be a really
long hair attaching them or something.

5313
02:25:05,661 --> 02:25:09,890
Like when you like the idea that you
did things just kind of like have some

5314
02:25:09,891 --> 02:25:12,140
invisible or tiny uh,

5315
02:25:12,230 --> 02:25:14,480
relationship that just stretches apart.

5316
02:25:14,630 --> 02:25:15,200
But the,

5317
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:20,030
the reason I say that it's Voodoo or
witchcraft is cause it's like Rosemary's

5318
02:25:20,031 --> 02:25:22,940
baby who remember the guy
called and he was missing his,

5319
02:25:23,740 --> 02:25:23,980
like

5320
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:27,080
one of the things which is are always
trying to do is deal a little piece of you

5321
02:25:27,100 --> 02:25:29,160
get your hair and quantum entanglements.

5322
02:25:29,170 --> 02:25:29,680
True.

5323
02:25:29,680 --> 02:25:32,800
Then that would mean that there's some
connection between you and the thing that

5324
02:25:32,801 --> 02:25:33,940
came from you did,

5325
02:25:33,941 --> 02:25:36,580
they could start shooting
bad energy down that line.

5326
02:25:36,640 --> 02:25:37,780
Whoa.

5327
02:25:38,050 --> 02:25:39,040
Holy Shit

5328
02:25:40,750 --> 02:25:41,583
Real.

5329
02:25:41,800 --> 02:25:43,300
They just didn't have the words for it.

5330
02:25:43,580 --> 02:25:45,260
I always thought about Alchemy,

5331
02:25:45,261 --> 02:25:46,670
like the idea of alchemy.

5332
02:25:46,700 --> 02:25:47,211
Like what,

5333
02:25:47,211 --> 02:25:50,930
you know when people are trying to make
gold at a lead and using magic and all

5334
02:25:50,931 --> 02:25:51,711
sorts of different things,

5335
02:25:51,711 --> 02:25:52,820
like where is it?

5336
02:25:53,120 --> 02:25:53,660
What's,

5337
02:25:53,660 --> 02:25:54,493
what's that?

5338
02:25:54,590 --> 02:25:55,040
Is that,

5339
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:55,520
is that,

5340
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:56,353
I mean if,

5341
02:25:56,360 --> 02:26:00,890
if we really do break down things as
far as their elemental structure and we

5342
02:26:00,891 --> 02:26:01,251
really under,

5343
02:26:01,251 --> 02:26:03,950
is it possible to turn
lead into gold Sunday?

5344
02:26:04,240 --> 02:26:06,230
Is someone going to be able to adjust,

5345
02:26:06,330 --> 02:26:06,651
you know,

5346
02:26:06,651 --> 02:26:06,951
what,

5347
02:26:06,951 --> 02:26:07,530
what the,

5348
02:26:07,530 --> 02:26:11,390
the molecules that the differentiate
between gold and lead and platinum and

5349
02:26:11,391 --> 02:26:11,750
silver,

5350
02:26:11,750 --> 02:26:12,583
is that possible?

5351
02:26:12,810 --> 02:26:13,643
Or you can do it.

5352
02:26:13,850 --> 02:26:14,021
I mean,

5353
02:26:14,021 --> 02:26:15,650
there are like the three d printers,

5354
02:26:15,651 --> 02:26:16,790
just sort of a diamonds.

5355
02:26:16,820 --> 02:26:17,091
It's,

5356
02:26:17,091 --> 02:26:17,990
that's like you're,

5357
02:26:17,991 --> 02:26:21,710
you're smashing something with intense
pressure and creating a new thing with

5358
02:26:21,711 --> 02:26:22,070
it,

5359
02:26:22,070 --> 02:26:23,930
but you're not turning
something into something.

5360
02:26:23,931 --> 02:26:24,560
It's not,

5361
02:26:24,560 --> 02:26:26,270
it's like a natural sort of,

5362
02:26:26,271 --> 02:26:26,440
uh,

5363
02:26:26,440 --> 02:26:28,670
men are mo fos metamorphoses right.

5364
02:26:28,671 --> 02:26:29,480
Doesn't that make sense?

5365
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:30,140
Yeah.

5366
02:26:30,140 --> 02:26:30,800
Well,

5367
02:26:30,800 --> 02:26:31,990
because we know like what the,

5368
02:26:31,991 --> 02:26:34,190
the chain reaction that causes diamonds,

5369
02:26:34,191 --> 02:26:38,390
we or the chemical reaction that pressure
and carbon and millions of years or

5370
02:26:38,460 --> 02:26:38,750
you know,

5371
02:26:38,750 --> 02:26:41,540
some crazy fucking thing that the
Russians event that makes diamonds out of

5372
02:26:41,541 --> 02:26:41,970
nothing.

5373
02:26:41,970 --> 02:26:42,121
Well,

5374
02:26:42,121 --> 02:26:43,560
have you ever heard the idea that coal,

5375
02:26:43,770 --> 02:26:45,600
that alchemy was

5376
02:26:47,310 --> 02:26:50,940
code for a secret society that was trying
to teach people to become enlightened

5377
02:26:50,941 --> 02:26:52,740
through science and that the idea,

5378
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:53,371
yeah,

5379
02:26:53,371 --> 02:26:54,450
lead into gold,

5380
02:26:54,720 --> 02:26:56,910
the ID of the transmutation
of lead into gold.

5381
02:26:57,270 --> 02:26:58,170
They didn't really,

5382
02:26:58,260 --> 02:27:01,080
even though that it
was a focus of alchemy,

5383
02:27:01,320 --> 02:27:02,490
there was a deeper level,

5384
02:27:02,491 --> 02:27:05,910
which is the idea that they're talking
about the transformation of the human

5385
02:27:05,911 --> 02:27:09,060
consciousness from going to a useless,

5386
02:27:09,090 --> 02:27:12,720
empty robotic state to a fully realized,

5387
02:27:12,721 --> 02:27:13,640
say like,

5388
02:27:13,800 --> 02:27:15,210
and once you go to that state,

5389
02:27:15,211 --> 02:27:16,890
you don't care if something's gold.

5390
02:27:17,160 --> 02:27:19,680
You don't care about the material.

5391
02:27:19,681 --> 02:27:21,360
Universe doesn't mean anything anymore.

5392
02:27:21,470 --> 02:27:22,580
I'd never heard that before.

5393
02:27:22,581 --> 02:27:26,300
I'd always heard it just described as
someone trying to manipulate one form of

5394
02:27:26,301 --> 02:27:28,190
matter to turn into
something more valuable.

5395
02:27:28,330 --> 02:27:28,510
Great.

5396
02:27:28,510 --> 02:27:28,820
Yeah.

5397
02:27:28,820 --> 02:27:29,720

5402
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:33,770
No.

5403
02:27:33,770 --> 02:27:34,401
How to say his name?

5404
02:27:34,401 --> 02:27:35,270

I'm going to spell it wrong.

5412
02:27:38,730 --> 02:27:39,590
What's his last name?

5413
02:27:39,591 --> 02:27:41,510
Joe To Roskie was super last name.

5414

Y.

5435
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:03,340
John Lennon paid for the
movie the Holy Mountain,

5436
02:28:03,580 --> 02:28:05,080
but like check it out.

5437
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:08,350
It was like at the time he had
this teacher was telling him,

5438
02:28:08,351 --> 02:28:08,471
well,

5439
02:28:08,471 --> 02:28:09,640
why you're making this movie?

5440
02:28:09,641 --> 02:28:11,770
Just take as much LSD as you can

5441
02:28:13,820 --> 02:28:15,610
and it always sound advice.

5442
02:28:15,640 --> 02:28:16,390
Check it out.

5443
02:28:16,390 --> 02:28:17,210
It's on youtube.

5444
02:28:17,210 --> 02:28:20,350
There's like a part of your
website that has all these movies.

5445
02:28:20,351 --> 02:28:23,630
You recommend all this shit because
you always bring out this crazy shit.

5446
02:28:23,631 --> 02:28:24,400
I have no way,

5447
02:28:24,400 --> 02:28:24,650
dude,

5448
02:28:24,650 --> 02:28:25,700
you should totally have that.

5449
02:28:25,730 --> 02:28:27,020
I should have a little list there.

5450
02:28:27,090 --> 02:28:29,210
Something really should
turn on your Amazon.

5451
02:28:29,330 --> 02:28:30,163
You should.

5452
02:28:31,010 --> 02:28:31,191
Yeah.

5453
02:28:31,191 --> 02:28:31,730
Well you,

5454
02:28:31,730 --> 02:28:33,840
you need to be more active
with your web presence fell on.

5455
02:28:33,850 --> 02:28:34,330
Yeah.

5456
02:28:34,330 --> 02:28:34,590
You,

5457
02:28:34,590 --> 02:28:37,310
I mean website cast and I tweet.

5458
02:28:37,790 --> 02:28:38,061
Yeah,

5459
02:28:38,061 --> 02:28:39,020
but your website,

5460
02:28:39,340 --> 02:28:40,290
which would be the what?

5461
02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:44,660
I used to do a lot more work on it now
until I've been working on this book.

5462
02:28:44,661 --> 02:28:45,520
I haven't been really riding.

5463
02:28:45,521 --> 02:28:46,354
I got asthma.

5464
02:28:47,240 --> 02:28:47,900
I do.

5465
02:28:47,900 --> 02:28:48,890
I love your website by the way.

5466
02:28:48,891 --> 02:28:50,990
I put it on a couple of
computers at apple the other day.

5467
02:28:51,800 --> 02:28:54,410
Homepage to visit the artistic terrorism?

5468
02:28:54,440 --> 02:28:54,651
No,

5469
02:28:54,651 --> 02:28:58,580
it's Duncan trussell.com used to have
the other one artist terrorism got yanked

5470
02:28:58,640 --> 02:29:02,880
from the by me from some
fucking Russian punks do it.

5471
02:29:03,980 --> 02:29:06,290
And then the next thing I knew
I went to artistic terrorism.

5472
02:29:06,291 --> 02:29:08,180
It's like some Russian site,

5473
02:29:08,210 --> 02:29:10,880
you can't get it back now it's gone.

5474
02:29:11,750 --> 02:29:13,080
Is that how it works the way?

5475
02:29:13,170 --> 02:29:15,050
It's pretty easy for that
to happen that just have,

5476
02:29:15,080 --> 02:29:16,160
that happens all the time.

5477
02:29:16,161 --> 02:29:18,350
A lot of people get like
conscious and gets their hosting.

5478
02:29:18,790 --> 02:29:19,310
So again,

5479
02:29:19,310 --> 02:29:20,240
that sounds like a name.

5480
02:29:20,241 --> 02:29:21,830
The guy who drowned
himself in the bathtub,

5481
02:29:21,890 --> 02:29:25,610
we'll come up with [inaudible]
and that was just a long time ago.

5482
02:29:25,611 --> 02:29:27,770
That was when I worked
at the comedy store.

5483
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:30,140
Do you remember when you worked at
the comedy store and we used to,

5484
02:29:30,141 --> 02:29:33,740
I used to call you up and we'd have long
ass fucking crazy conversations while

5485
02:29:33,741 --> 02:29:34,574
you were working there.

5486
02:29:34,980 --> 02:29:36,050
That's how he got to be friends.

5487
02:29:36,450 --> 02:29:37,040
Yeah.

5488
02:29:37,040 --> 02:29:37,520
Well,

5489
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:40,790
I used to know Dunkin from Dunkin
hanging out there and then Dunkin started

5490
02:29:40,791 --> 02:29:45,050
working for the store and I would call
up and dug it and I would have long

5491
02:29:45,051 --> 02:29:48,680
fucking bizarre conversations
that would last for hours.

5492
02:29:48,680 --> 02:29:49,460
While you were,

5493
02:29:49,460 --> 02:29:50,360
while you were working.

5494
02:29:50,450 --> 02:29:54,260
Pretty much this would happen
over the phone and dunking.

5495
02:29:54,350 --> 02:29:59,330
Here's proof that Dunkin practices what
he preaches when he was working at the

5496
02:29:59,331 --> 02:29:59,871
comedy store.

5497
02:29:59,871 --> 02:30:04,310
That's when the Pauly shore reality
show came around and everybody else went

5498
02:30:04,311 --> 02:30:05,510
along with it and is like,

5499
02:30:05,511 --> 02:30:06,020
you know what,

5500
02:30:06,020 --> 02:30:07,940
I don't want to be a part
of this and you quit.

5501
02:30:07,970 --> 02:30:08,640
I quit.

5502
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:09,800
And you didn't have an option.

5503
02:30:09,860 --> 02:30:11,000
I didn't want to be on that show.

5504
02:30:11,110 --> 02:30:11,901
Well man,

5505
02:30:11,901 --> 02:30:12,161
what,

5506
02:30:12,161 --> 02:30:13,790
what started happening is like,

5507
02:30:13,940 --> 02:30:14,691
it seemed like,

5508
02:30:14,691 --> 02:30:15,100
you know,

5509
02:30:15,100 --> 02:30:19,550
he was talking about trying
to make a show happen and uh,

5510
02:30:19,551 --> 02:30:20,241
you know,

5511
02:30:20,241 --> 02:30:24,740
and then the show started happening
for real and all of a sudden I couldn't

5512
02:30:24,741 --> 02:30:27,290
sleep at night and I
was grinding my teeth.

5513
02:30:27,830 --> 02:30:31,520
Cause the idea of having to be on
this reality show and like I was,

5514
02:30:31,521 --> 02:30:32,600
I would wake up and I,

5515
02:30:32,640 --> 02:30:34,940
my teeth grinding and I'd be like,

5516
02:30:34,970 --> 02:30:35,281
oh,

5517
02:30:35,281 --> 02:30:37,880
and this fucking feeling
that pit of my stomach.

5518
02:30:37,880 --> 02:30:38,150
Like,

5519
02:30:38,150 --> 02:30:39,260
oh no,

5520
02:30:39,261 --> 02:30:40,094
this is it.

5521
02:30:40,220 --> 02:30:41,060
This is how you're going to,

5522
02:30:41,061 --> 02:30:42,440
cause I didn't know at
the time I was like,

5523
02:30:42,441 --> 02:30:43,220
fuck this.

5524
02:30:43,220 --> 02:30:44,450
What if the show takes off?

5525
02:30:44,810 --> 02:30:45,643
What if you're the,

5526
02:30:45,800 --> 02:30:46,633
you're the,

5527
02:30:46,640 --> 02:30:49,970
you're the fucking guy who works
with poly at the comedy store.

5528
02:30:49,971 --> 02:30:50,300
You're,

5529
02:30:50,300 --> 02:30:51,320
you're not a comedian.

5530
02:30:51,410 --> 02:30:52,820
You're just the guy behind a desk.

5531
02:30:52,821 --> 02:30:56,360
Answering the phone from Mitzi was
just like the most humiliating.

5532
02:30:56,720 --> 02:30:59,120
It would have been the worst thing ever.

5533
02:30:59,140 --> 02:30:59,973
Yeah.

5534
02:31:00,460 --> 02:31:01,670
That was cool that he did.

5535
02:31:01,790 --> 02:31:02,001
Yeah.

5536
02:31:02,001 --> 02:31:02,661
You've really,

5537
02:31:02,661 --> 02:31:02,960
uh,

5538
02:31:02,960 --> 02:31:04,070
you really like,

5539
02:31:04,430 --> 02:31:04,701
you know,

5540
02:31:04,701 --> 02:31:04,841
you,

5541
02:31:04,841 --> 02:31:06,320
you had a reaction to it.

5542
02:31:06,400 --> 02:31:08,210
A very strong reaction,

5543
02:31:08,420 --> 02:31:10,970
which a lot of people wouldn't because
this is an opportunity for you to get on

5544
02:31:10,971 --> 02:31:11,580
television,

5545
02:31:11,580 --> 02:31:12,260
on TV.

5546
02:31:12,260 --> 02:31:12,771
Also,

5547
02:31:12,771 --> 02:31:13,850
I got to get on TV.

5548
02:31:13,851 --> 02:31:15,650
I just got to get in front
of those cameras at all.

5549
02:31:16,040 --> 02:31:17,750
Do you think you could
have done for your factor?

5550
02:31:18,320 --> 02:31:19,040
What do you mean?

5551
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:20,040
If someone came up to

5552
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:20,371
you and said,

5553
02:31:20,371 --> 02:31:20,941
Hey Dunkin,

5554
02:31:20,941 --> 02:31:21,774
we have this show,

5555
02:31:21,870 --> 02:31:23,370
we want you to host fear factor.

5556
02:31:23,490 --> 02:31:24,780
It's going to be this network,

5557
02:31:25,140 --> 02:31:26,130
a reality show.

5558
02:31:26,131 --> 02:31:26,400
Yeah.

5559
02:31:26,400 --> 02:31:26,980
I don't think,

5560
02:31:26,980 --> 02:31:28,110
I don't think that would have been your,

5561
02:31:28,710 --> 02:31:30,120
I know you might not have done it.

5562
02:31:30,480 --> 02:31:30,901
You're,

5563
02:31:30,901 --> 02:31:31,920
you're a weird dude man.

5564
02:31:31,921 --> 02:31:32,940
You might have walked away from me.

5565
02:31:33,150 --> 02:31:34,650
Blame the difference between,

5566
02:31:34,680 --> 02:31:35,281
and by the way,

5567
02:31:35,281 --> 02:31:40,281
cause I do not want to come off like
I'm some kind of like a saint or self

5568
02:31:40,621 --> 02:31:41,071
righteous,

5569
02:31:41,071 --> 02:31:42,880
like super like my art.

5570
02:31:43,130 --> 02:31:43,710
What does it take?

5571
02:31:43,710 --> 02:31:43,910
Right.

5572
02:31:43,910 --> 02:31:46,250
It wasn't just any
reality show by the way.

5573
02:31:46,251 --> 02:31:51,251
You had worked there and saw the toxic
environment dealing with for a long time

5574
02:31:52,480 --> 02:31:56,420
and then saw that the most toxic
of all was in control of this,

5575
02:31:56,540 --> 02:32:00,050
this sort of project and it was going
down all the wrong paths and you know,

5576
02:32:00,051 --> 02:32:01,590
you made it a conscious too,

5577
02:32:01,640 --> 02:32:02,060
Susan.

5578
02:32:02,060 --> 02:32:04,460
I needed a way the fuck out of that job.

5579
02:32:04,461 --> 02:32:06,410
It was a desk job and like yeah,

5580
02:32:06,430 --> 02:32:06,840
you know,

5581
02:32:06,840 --> 02:32:08,390
I needed to get the fuck out.

5582
02:32:08,391 --> 02:32:09,224
And it was just like,

5583
02:32:09,320 --> 02:32:12,380
it seemed like a lot of things
were aligning at the same time.

5584
02:32:12,620 --> 02:32:17,620
They gave me a way to move on
instead of a continuing in a,

5585
02:32:18,730 --> 02:32:20,060
in this job that,

5586
02:32:20,210 --> 02:32:20,691
by the way,

5587
02:32:20,691 --> 02:32:22,910
it was like a job where I was tired of it.

5588
02:32:23,120 --> 02:32:27,530
The guy who's the current
talent coordinator was
obviously really into the idea

5589
02:32:27,531 --> 02:32:28,670
of having that job.

5590
02:32:28,671 --> 02:32:29,421
Like for him,

5591
02:32:29,421 --> 02:32:30,830
he wanted to do it,

5592
02:32:31,220 --> 02:32:31,971
whereas for me,

5593
02:32:31,971 --> 02:32:32,804
it was like,

5594
02:32:33,170 --> 02:32:36,230
it had gotten to the point where I
wasn't inspired by it and it was,

5595
02:32:36,231 --> 02:32:41,231
this seem like to continue on would be
the ultimate hypocrisy and would be a

5596
02:32:42,891 --> 02:32:43,970
shitty move on

5597
02:32:44,260 --> 02:32:44,800
every single.

5598
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:46,990
That's interesting because a lot of
people would have never thought about that

5599
02:32:46,991 --> 02:32:47,111
way.

5600
02:32:47,111 --> 02:32:47,740
They would've thought,

5601
02:32:47,740 --> 02:32:47,981
well,

5602
02:32:47,981 --> 02:32:48,820
here's an opportunity.

5603
02:32:48,821 --> 02:32:49,090
I mean,

5604
02:32:49,090 --> 02:32:50,920
honestly meet me personally,

5605
02:32:50,921 --> 02:32:52,480
I probably would have
thought about it and said,

5606
02:32:52,481 --> 02:32:53,190
well,

5607
02:32:53,190 --> 02:32:53,470
you know,

5608
02:32:53,470 --> 02:32:54,221
if I was working there,

5609
02:32:54,221 --> 02:32:55,520
at least I'll get on television,

5610
02:32:55,550 --> 02:32:56,950
this will give me an opportunity to,

5611
02:32:56,951 --> 02:32:57,221
you know,

5612
02:32:57,221 --> 02:32:59,050
maybe branch off and do other things,

5613
02:32:59,051 --> 02:32:59,880
you know?

5614
02:32:59,880 --> 02:33:00,211
Yeah.

5615
02:33:00,211 --> 02:33:00,451
Well,

5616
02:33:00,451 --> 02:33:00,751
you know,

5617
02:33:00,751 --> 02:33:01,050
man,

5618
02:33:01,050 --> 02:33:01,590
there's a,

5619
02:33:01,590 --> 02:33:04,740
I've got a really like weird hang up,

5620
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:05,371
uh,

5621
02:33:05,371 --> 02:33:07,080
when it comes to performance,

5622
02:33:07,081 --> 02:33:08,790
which is that I think that people,

5623
02:33:09,030 --> 02:33:11,940
if they're performing for
something that's making money,

5624
02:33:12,210 --> 02:33:14,010
deserve to get paid for it.

5625
02:33:14,011 --> 02:33:17,670
And so when I do our comedy
show at the cemetery Thursday,

5626
02:33:17,730 --> 02:33:18,211
we pay,

5627
02:33:18,211 --> 02:33:18,481
oh yeah,

5628
02:33:18,481 --> 02:33:19,314
it's this Thursday.

5629
02:33:19,410 --> 02:33:20,730
We pay our comedians.

5630
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:21,420
Uh,

5631
02:33:21,420 --> 02:33:25,170
we pay everyone who performs
and if I'm shooting something,

5632
02:33:25,350 --> 02:33:26,700
even if it's something that,

5633
02:33:27,020 --> 02:33:27,250
uh,

5634
02:33:27,250 --> 02:33:28,800
I'm not getting paid for,

5635
02:33:28,801 --> 02:33:31,650
if someone comes in is in
a sketch I come up with,

5636
02:33:31,890 --> 02:33:35,610
I pay them like I give them money because
they drove out there and gave me their

5637
02:33:35,611 --> 02:33:37,680
time and they fucking deserve it.

5638
02:33:37,681 --> 02:33:38,071
Cause that's,

5639
02:33:38,071 --> 02:33:41,280
I believe that you should
be compensated a for art.

5640
02:33:41,310 --> 02:33:43,470
I think that it's one of
the highest things ever.

5641
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:48,060
So another thing that was a little off
putting about that show is that I was

5642
02:33:48,061 --> 02:33:49,260
clearly going to white,

5643
02:33:49,261 --> 02:33:49,740
not,

5644
02:33:49,740 --> 02:33:53,340
it wasn't just like they were going
to film me at my desk doing my job.

5645
02:33:53,610 --> 02:33:57,270
It was like they wanted to
create a heightened reality.

5646
02:33:57,600 --> 02:33:58,291
You know what I mean?

5647
02:33:58,291 --> 02:34:01,030
Which one of you to fake
shit and follow a script.

5648
02:34:01,110 --> 02:34:01,700
So I brought,

5649
02:34:01,700 --> 02:34:02,420
it was a bad school,

5650
02:34:02,420 --> 02:34:02,881
so I said,

5651
02:34:02,881 --> 02:34:03,390
you know,

5652
02:34:03,390 --> 02:34:04,161
well what?

5653
02:34:04,161 --> 02:34:04,870
What did well,

5654
02:34:04,870 --> 02:34:05,760
I'm an eat for one.

5655
02:34:05,761 --> 02:34:06,050
I was,

5656
02:34:06,050 --> 02:34:06,721
I was even then,

5657
02:34:06,721 --> 02:34:07,321
I was in a,

5658
02:34:07,321 --> 02:34:09,510
after I was in a actors' union.

5659
02:34:09,511 --> 02:34:09,841
It's like,

5660
02:34:09,841 --> 02:34:10,680
so wait a minute,

5661
02:34:11,820 --> 02:34:13,650
you're not going to pay me for acting.

5662
02:34:13,651 --> 02:34:14,100
Don't like,

5663
02:34:14,100 --> 02:34:16,290
I'm you ha you have to like you,

5664
02:34:16,291 --> 02:34:16,501
we,

5665
02:34:16,501 --> 02:34:17,080
I get caught.

5666
02:34:17,080 --> 02:34:18,460
I know that you're making money.

5667
02:34:18,790 --> 02:34:22,030
Anyone who's acting in spending their
time involved in this thing should be

5668
02:34:22,031 --> 02:34:22,781
getting paid.

5669
02:34:22,781 --> 02:34:23,950
They should get a little piece,

5670
02:34:24,190 --> 02:34:25,300
but then you weren't going to get paid.

5671
02:34:25,330 --> 02:34:27,010
The producer had said to me,

5672
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:30,010
absolutely not.

5673
02:34:30,280 --> 02:34:31,600
No Way.

5674
02:34:31,780 --> 02:34:33,010
This is a documentary.

5675
02:34:33,011 --> 02:34:34,450
We're shooting a documentary.

5676
02:34:34,630 --> 02:34:35,011
You're,

5677
02:34:35,011 --> 02:34:35,711
you're not.

5678
02:34:35,711 --> 02:34:36,544
There's no,

5679
02:34:36,670 --> 02:34:37,360
that's fucked up.

5680
02:34:37,360 --> 02:34:38,081
There's no payment.

5681
02:34:38,081 --> 02:34:38,560
Yeah.

5682
02:34:38,560 --> 02:34:39,041
Wait a minute.

5683
02:34:39,041 --> 02:34:39,201
What?

5684
02:34:39,201 --> 02:34:40,540
W who is the producer?

5685
02:34:40,960 --> 02:34:42,530
Whoever was producing two hands,

5686
02:34:42,580 --> 02:34:45,810
they literally told you that you're going
to be on the show and not get paid at

5687
02:34:45,811 --> 02:34:45,940
all.

5688
02:34:45,940 --> 02:34:46,570
All.

5689
02:34:46,570 --> 02:34:47,220
Yeah.

5690
02:34:47,220 --> 02:34:50,730
So you were going to be on TV making your
salary from the comedy store that you

5691
02:34:50,731 --> 02:34:51,564
go,

5692
02:34:51,930 --> 02:34:52,790
Whoa,

5693
02:34:52,850 --> 02:34:53,683
I didn't know that.

5694
02:34:54,050 --> 02:34:54,920
Whoa,

5695
02:34:54,950 --> 02:34:55,640
what

5696
02:34:55,640 --> 02:34:56,730
bunch of cunts.

5697
02:34:57,170 --> 02:34:58,490
I did not know that at all.

5698
02:34:58,520 --> 02:34:58,760
Yeah,

5699
02:34:58,760 --> 02:34:59,860
so that would,

5700
02:34:59,870 --> 02:35:00,351
that is that,

5701
02:35:00,351 --> 02:35:03,860
does that surprise you given the toxic
environment that we were talking about,

5702
02:35:03,861 --> 02:35:04,694
what you do,

5703
02:35:04,730 --> 02:35:08,570
how about a comics opening for him and
not getting paid and all sorts of the

5704
02:35:08,570 --> 02:35:09,980
Shit Day you're doing
it for the store buddy?

5705
02:35:10,050 --> 02:35:10,201
Well,

5706
02:35:10,201 --> 02:35:10,441
no,

5707
02:35:10,441 --> 02:35:11,760
that's the C and that's the,

5708
02:35:11,820 --> 02:35:12,220
the the,

5709
02:35:12,220 --> 02:35:15,690
the problem about that attitude,

5710
02:35:15,780 --> 02:35:16,613
uh,

5711
02:35:16,860 --> 02:35:20,010
which is in so many
different aspects of society,

5712
02:35:20,011 --> 02:35:25,011
which is where the artist is given the
impression that they are lucky to be

5713
02:35:26,551 --> 02:35:28,590
doing there are in a certain place.

5714
02:35:28,620 --> 02:35:29,070
Yes.

5715
02:35:29,070 --> 02:35:31,050
That is fucking satanism.

5716
02:35:31,140 --> 02:35:32,460
That is not how it works,

5717
02:35:32,461 --> 02:35:32,701
man.

5718
02:35:32,701 --> 02:35:35,380
It's like I don't care what
the fucking place is the are,

5719
02:35:35,400 --> 02:35:38,970
if it's a place that's making money
and generating money off the artist,

5720
02:35:38,971 --> 02:35:39,481
the artist,

5721
02:35:39,481 --> 02:35:41,580
is it the top of the fucking pyramid,

5722
02:35:41,820 --> 02:35:41,971
right.

5723
02:35:41,971 --> 02:35:42,930
Actually this logic,

5724
02:35:43,080 --> 02:35:46,320
if there's a fucking guy who
makes beautiful cabinets,

5725
02:35:46,440 --> 02:35:48,630
the most beautiful cabinets in the world,

5726
02:35:49,140 --> 02:35:50,550
that guy is not going to be like,

5727
02:35:50,551 --> 02:35:50,821
man,

5728
02:35:50,821 --> 02:35:55,821
I am so lucky to be in this workshop
where they let me make these cabinets.

5729
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:56,580
No,

5730
02:35:56,580 --> 02:35:56,771
the,

5731
02:35:56,771 --> 02:36:00,990
the comedy store is the worst case example
of a place that thinks it's the star,

5732
02:36:01,350 --> 02:36:02,430
the place that thinks it's,

5733
02:36:02,431 --> 02:36:03,210
what's it called?

5734
02:36:03,210 --> 02:36:04,530
Let me just say it's changed a lot.

5735
02:36:04,531 --> 02:36:04,660
Like,

5736
02:36:04,660 --> 02:36:05,010
yeah,

5737
02:36:05,010 --> 02:36:05,843
it has,

5738
02:36:07,530 --> 02:36:09,690
I have to stick up for
the place because I,

5739
02:36:09,691 --> 02:36:10,524
um,

5740
02:36:10,710 --> 02:36:11,543
uh,

5741
02:36:11,880 --> 02:36:12,161
well,

5742
02:36:12,161 --> 02:36:13,800
but I go up there regularly and I,

5743
02:36:14,190 --> 02:36:14,610
uh,

5744
02:36:14,610 --> 02:36:16,200
the climate is kind of took it back.

5745
02:36:16,230 --> 02:36:17,440
Comics kind of take it back,

5746
02:36:18,320 --> 02:36:19,290
the place possible.

5747
02:36:19,291 --> 02:36:19,711
Honestly,

5748
02:36:19,711 --> 02:36:21,390
the places on the Dean's
still the manager.

5749
02:36:21,430 --> 02:36:21,750
No,

5750
02:36:21,750 --> 02:36:23,100
I've never seen him there anymore.

5751
02:36:23,380 --> 02:36:25,140
She's undergone a fucking,

5752
02:36:25,630 --> 02:36:27,630
a geologic shift.

5753
02:36:27,780 --> 02:36:29,850
They're putting on really
good acts right now.

5754
02:36:29,880 --> 02:36:31,950
It's fucking packed all the time.

5755
02:36:32,130 --> 02:36:34,260
It's got a really exciting,

5756
02:36:34,261 --> 02:36:35,310
good vibe there.

5757
02:36:35,460 --> 02:36:40,320
And that period of stagnation
and weirdness that were
new when with which made

5758
02:36:40,321 --> 02:36:40,531
you,

5759
02:36:40,531 --> 02:36:41,730
which drove you out,

5760
02:36:41,970 --> 02:36:42,900
that's long gone.

5761
02:36:42,901 --> 02:36:43,040
Yeah.

5762
02:36:43,040 --> 02:36:43,330
Really?

5763
02:36:43,330 --> 02:36:44,160
Yeah.

5764
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:45,240
What do you think killed that man?

5765
02:36:45,241 --> 02:36:46,440
So you're not being around anymore.

5766
02:36:46,730 --> 02:36:47,181
Uh,

5767
02:36:47,181 --> 02:36:47,630
I wouldn't,

5768
02:36:47,630 --> 02:36:48,380
I changed it.

5769
02:36:48,380 --> 02:36:50,180
I just still welcome to go there.

5770
02:36:50,181 --> 02:36:50,870
Right man.

5771
02:36:50,870 --> 02:36:51,350
See Ya.

5772
02:36:51,350 --> 02:36:51,710
Yeah.

5773
02:36:51,710 --> 02:36:53,020
He can still go there and I don't know,

5774
02:36:53,040 --> 02:36:53,771
but it's only once.

5775
02:36:53,771 --> 02:36:54,190
I don't,

5776
02:36:54,190 --> 02:36:56,630
I think he has to call in
now where he be getting,

5777
02:36:56,930 --> 02:36:58,700
I think Sarah Silverman
just went up there.

5778
02:36:58,701 --> 02:36:59,900
She's there all the time.

5779
02:36:59,950 --> 02:37:02,000
Chappelle's every time
I go in there I'm like,

5780
02:37:02,510 --> 02:37:03,980
what the fuck?

5781
02:37:03,981 --> 02:37:06,410
It's generally just like burgeoning,

5782
02:37:06,411 --> 02:37:07,460
like you know what it seems like,

5783
02:37:07,461 --> 02:37:10,660
it seems like the management kind of
took a step a couple steps back or that

5784
02:37:10,661 --> 02:37:12,330
they were told to or that,

5785
02:37:12,331 --> 02:37:15,650
that they just kind of got bored of
trying to be because now seems like really

5786
02:37:15,651 --> 02:37:16,130
you just see

5787
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:16,960
the comics,

5788
02:37:16,960 --> 02:37:17,793
the comics are

5789
02:37:17,870 --> 02:37:18,620
just all,

5790
02:37:18,620 --> 02:37:20,010
that's always best case scenario,

5791
02:37:20,130 --> 02:37:20,450
you know,

5792
02:37:20,450 --> 02:37:20,910
um,

5793
02:37:20,910 --> 02:37:22,980
this talk about people getting paid.

5794
02:37:22,981 --> 02:37:25,230
Here's another interesting topic that I
want to bring up to you and we'll just

5795
02:37:25,231 --> 02:37:26,910
end on this because we've
been going on forever.

5796
02:37:27,240 --> 02:37:31,800
There's a lot of podcasts that are doing
podcasts now and find a live audiences

5797
02:37:32,010 --> 02:37:34,350
and it's a way of generating
revenue for the podcast.

5798
02:37:34,351 --> 02:37:38,070
But they're not paying the people
that are guests on the podcast,

5799
02:37:38,490 --> 02:37:38,911
you know?

5800
02:37:38,911 --> 02:37:39,290
And,

5801
02:37:39,290 --> 02:37:39,480
uh,

5802
02:37:39,480 --> 02:37:40,860
one invited me,

5803
02:37:40,861 --> 02:37:41,880
and I'm not going to name any names,

5804
02:37:41,881 --> 02:37:45,330
but invited me to go and be on one
of their podcasts in front of a live

5805
02:37:45,331 --> 02:37:46,080
audience.

5806
02:37:46,080 --> 02:37:46,913
And I said,

5807
02:37:46,950 --> 02:37:47,670
he know,

5808
02:37:47,670 --> 02:37:48,370
you know what?

5809
02:37:48,370 --> 02:37:49,440
No one's picketing paid you.

5810
02:37:49,441 --> 02:37:49,741
Your,

5811
02:37:49,741 --> 02:37:50,180
you're going to do,

5812
02:37:50,180 --> 02:37:52,140
someone's going to drive an hour away.

5813
02:37:52,230 --> 02:37:53,190
And I've done this before,

5814
02:37:53,191 --> 02:37:53,611
by the way,

5815
02:37:53,611 --> 02:37:54,390
because I just,

5816
02:37:54,390 --> 02:37:54,990
you know,

5817
02:37:54,990 --> 02:37:55,823
it's kind of a,

5818
02:37:55,850 --> 02:37:56,460
uh,

5819
02:37:56,460 --> 02:37:56,761
you know,

5820
02:37:56,761 --> 02:37:59,310
it's an opportunity to go
and be on something and,

5821
02:37:59,311 --> 02:37:59,610
you know,

5822
02:37:59,610 --> 02:38:00,930
have some fun and you know,

5823
02:38:00,931 --> 02:38:02,970
and network with all these other
people that are doing these things.

5824
02:38:03,210 --> 02:38:04,260
But at a certain point in time,

5825
02:38:04,261 --> 02:38:04,471
I'd be like,

5826
02:38:04,471 --> 02:38:04,831
wait a minute,

5827
02:38:04,831 --> 02:38:05,131
wait a minute,

5828
02:38:05,131 --> 02:38:05,490
wait a minute.

5829
02:38:05,490 --> 02:38:06,360
How much do you charge?

5830
02:38:06,650 --> 02:38:08,880
There's costs 20 bucks to get in,

5831
02:38:08,881 --> 02:38:09,810
or 30 bucks to get in.

5832
02:38:10,020 --> 02:38:11,370
And you've got 500 people in here.

5833
02:38:11,490 --> 02:38:12,390
What's going on here?

5834
02:38:12,750 --> 02:38:14,070
Is this a comedy show?

5835
02:38:14,190 --> 02:38:16,020
Because if it's a comedy show
that it makes sense that,

5836
02:38:16,021 --> 02:38:16,291
you know,

5837
02:38:16,291 --> 02:38:17,071
you're the headliner,

5838
02:38:17,071 --> 02:38:18,360
but you have to pay the opening act.

5839
02:38:18,420 --> 02:38:19,400
You gotta pay the Middle Act,

5840
02:38:19,401 --> 02:38:21,360
you've got to pay everyone
who performs on your show.

5841
02:38:21,530 --> 02:38:21,820
You know,

5842
02:38:21,820 --> 02:38:23,410
it's a note that the bandwidth though,

5843
02:38:23,411 --> 02:38:25,840
that podcasts have been
racking up on some people.

5844
02:38:25,841 --> 02:38:27,100
Like what was Adam Carolla saying?

5845
02:38:27,101 --> 02:38:29,210
Navy is paying up to $5,000 a month.

5846
02:38:29,220 --> 02:38:29,981
You said 10,000,

5847
02:38:29,981 --> 02:38:30,870
$10,000 a month.

5848
02:38:31,090 --> 02:38:31,331
I mean,

5849
02:38:31,331 --> 02:38:32,560
that Shit's real shit,

5850
02:38:32,561 --> 02:38:32,861
man.

5851
02:38:32,861 --> 02:38:34,780
That fucking bandwidth podcast,

5852
02:38:34,820 --> 02:38:36,160
we'll usually about 100 megabytes each.

5853
02:38:36,161 --> 02:38:37,090
He Times that by law,

5854
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:37,390
I don't know,

5855
02:38:37,390 --> 02:38:38,680
a couple of hundred thousand people.

5856
02:38:38,681 --> 02:38:39,970
That's ridiculous.

5857
02:38:40,520 --> 02:38:41,353
But you know what?

5858
02:38:41,660 --> 02:38:41,931
Yes.

5859
02:38:41,931 --> 02:38:42,350
What,

5860
02:38:42,350 --> 02:38:42,740
um,

5861
02:38:42,740 --> 02:38:43,011
the,

5862
02:38:43,011 --> 02:38:43,341
you know,

5863
02:38:43,341 --> 02:38:45,800
how much does it benefit those
comics to be on the show?

5864
02:38:45,860 --> 02:38:47,000
It benefits them a bit,

5865
02:38:47,001 --> 02:38:50,070
but it definitely benefits the person
who's running the podcast to have a,

5866
02:38:50,220 --> 02:38:52,060
a star on their podcasts.

5867
02:38:52,220 --> 02:38:52,461
You know,

5868
02:38:52,461 --> 02:38:53,910
if you're going to do it
in front of a live on it.

5869
02:38:53,940 --> 02:38:56,000
So it's a weird situation right now.

5870
02:38:56,001 --> 02:38:56,271
It's like,

5871
02:38:56,271 --> 02:38:59,330
it's a weird dynamic and almost feels
like we need a union to step in.

5872
02:38:59,750 --> 02:39:00,430
It's like,

5873
02:39:00,430 --> 02:39:00,740
what's,

5874
02:39:00,740 --> 02:39:01,190
I mean,

5875
02:39:01,190 --> 02:39:02,023
how can you do that?

5876
02:39:02,110 --> 02:39:04,010
There's just a basic logic,

5877
02:39:04,320 --> 02:39:05,100
uh,

5878
02:39:05,100 --> 02:39:06,290
that should go behind.

5879
02:39:06,291 --> 02:39:07,490
If you're making a show,

5880
02:39:07,491 --> 02:39:08,540
if you're producing a show,

5881
02:39:08,570 --> 02:39:09,740
there's just a basic logic,

5882
02:39:09,741 --> 02:39:13,790
the basic logic gates that the
performers are the heart of the show.

5883
02:39:14,060 --> 02:39:15,260
If you're making money,

5884
02:39:15,350 --> 02:39:16,730
you have to compensate them.

5885
02:39:16,970 --> 02:39:17,900
That's just logic.

5886
02:39:18,020 --> 02:39:20,510
You're not doing them a favor
by letting them perform,

5887
02:39:20,630 --> 02:39:22,550
but you are kind of a
little bit because you're,

5888
02:39:22,551 --> 02:39:22,941
you know,

5889
02:39:22,941 --> 02:39:23,230
you're,

5890
02:39:23,230 --> 02:39:24,380
you're giving them exposure.

5891
02:39:24,380 --> 02:39:26,450
Made me think about every
time you come on this show,

5892
02:39:26,640 --> 02:39:27,351
I mean this show,

5893
02:39:27,351 --> 02:39:31,220
obviously we're not getting paid
except for the sponsor and the sponsor.

5894
02:39:31,221 --> 02:39:32,810
Basically it's all gone.

5895
02:39:32,840 --> 02:39:36,100
I mean the sponsor pays for bandwidth
and Brian and a bunch of other things and

5896
02:39:36,101 --> 02:39:36,890
it's all gone.

5897
02:39:36,890 --> 02:39:37,900
But you,

5898
02:39:37,960 --> 02:39:40,970
you get on a show like
this and for sure it,

5899
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:42,860
it elevates you and makes
people aware of you.

5900
02:39:42,861 --> 02:39:44,210
But then on the other hand,

5901
02:39:44,570 --> 02:39:46,550
the show's way better
when you're on like it,

5902
02:39:46,551 --> 02:39:47,570
it benefits us too.

5903
02:39:47,690 --> 02:39:47,971
Like Dan,

5904
02:39:47,971 --> 02:39:51,560
I used to bother me a lot about like
radio shows were like someone would say

5905
02:39:51,561 --> 02:39:52,700
something douchey about someone.

5906
02:39:52,701 --> 02:39:54,050
The person wouldn't want
to do the show anymore.

5907
02:39:54,051 --> 02:39:54,441
And they would say,

5908
02:39:54,441 --> 02:39:54,621
hey,

5909
02:39:54,621 --> 02:39:55,430
didn't we help you?

5910
02:39:55,430 --> 02:39:56,360
Didn't we help you out?

5911
02:39:56,361 --> 02:39:56,990
Like,

5912
02:39:56,990 --> 02:39:57,321
yeah,

5913
02:39:57,321 --> 02:39:57,891
but you got to,

5914
02:39:57,891 --> 02:39:58,760
you can look at it that way.

5915
02:39:58,761 --> 02:40:02,030
But it also look at it like you need to
have funny people on your shelf or your

5916
02:40:02,031 --> 02:40:02,864
show to be good.

5917
02:40:02,870 --> 02:40:03,531
He should be happy.

5918
02:40:03,531 --> 02:40:04,490
They go on it.

5919
02:40:04,491 --> 02:40:06,280
Shouldn't you know that the devil,

5920
02:40:06,290 --> 02:40:07,190
here's the insurance man,

5921
02:40:07,250 --> 02:40:09,110
this show for one.

5922
02:40:09,500 --> 02:40:13,920
I've made a fortune and
flashlights fucking many.

5923
02:40:14,270 --> 02:40:15,103
Ah,

5924
02:40:15,350 --> 02:40:16,890
and the other thing about it is that,

5925
02:40:17,010 --> 02:40:17,843
um,

5926
02:40:18,060 --> 02:40:19,950
we're friends and it's like,

5927
02:40:20,250 --> 02:40:21,083
it's,

5928
02:40:21,450 --> 02:40:23,100
there's no sense of like,

5929
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:24,840
you're lucky to be here.

5930
02:40:24,950 --> 02:40:26,420
This is the best venue for you though,

5931
02:40:26,421 --> 02:40:26,661
man.

5932
02:40:26,661 --> 02:40:27,460
This is the best,

5933
02:40:27,460 --> 02:40:27,861
the,

5934
02:40:27,861 --> 02:40:28,150
the,

5935
02:40:28,150 --> 02:40:31,730
the best opportunity that people
have ever had to get a look at.

5936
02:40:31,940 --> 02:40:36,050
What's special about you and weird about
you to have these long ass two and a

5937
02:40:36,051 --> 02:40:37,730
half plus our conversations,

5938
02:40:37,770 --> 02:40:39,620
we're get into weird depth
about chess a little,

5939
02:40:39,630 --> 02:40:42,980
but people get a chance to
see your personality and
the way you would never get

5940
02:40:42,981 --> 02:40:47,030
exposed to on a talk show or there's
no way in some seven minute clip on,

5941
02:40:47,240 --> 02:40:47,541
you know,

5942
02:40:47,541 --> 02:40:48,321
name the show.

5943
02:40:48,321 --> 02:40:49,154
You know,

5944
02:40:49,670 --> 02:40:50,990
I don't know when Jimmy Fallon,

5945
02:40:50,991 --> 02:40:51,710
the name,

5946
02:40:51,710 --> 02:40:52,950
whatever the show is it any,

5947
02:40:52,960 --> 02:40:53,793
any of those shows?

5948
02:40:53,810 --> 02:40:54,281
What are you gonna do?

5949
02:40:54,281 --> 02:40:57,130
You're gonna talk about something for
seven minutes and sitting at the desk and

5950
02:40:57,140 --> 02:40:58,220
come up with a cup of coffee.

5951
02:40:58,270 --> 02:40:59,330
Don't know people.

5952
02:40:59,331 --> 02:41:02,070
You know the way people know
us from doing this show the,

5953
02:41:02,130 --> 02:41:03,470
they know you in a deep,

5954
02:41:03,471 --> 02:41:08,030
deep way that really there's no other
opportunity to get this close to people

5955
02:41:08,090 --> 02:41:10,100
does close to the workings of the mind.

5956
02:41:10,190 --> 02:41:10,461
Dude,

5957
02:41:10,461 --> 02:41:15,461
I have fucking still ongoing conversations
happening on Facebook with people

5958
02:41:17,091 --> 02:41:18,320
from this podcast.

5959
02:41:18,321 --> 02:41:19,070
He like,

5960
02:41:19,070 --> 02:41:23,270
I'll tell them something crazy and then
they'll email me like the most insane

5961
02:41:23,300 --> 02:41:28,190
subversive fucking video or
just like really crazy shit.

5962
02:41:28,220 --> 02:41:31,250
Sometimes I can't go on Facebook if
I'm to stone because I'll start getting

5963
02:41:31,251 --> 02:41:36,140
paranoid because there'll be some like
heavy duty weird fucking shit up there.

5964
02:41:36,230 --> 02:41:36,760
Yeah.

5965
02:41:36,760 --> 02:41:37,481
Well you know what ma'am,

5966
02:41:37,481 --> 02:41:38,470
this is what's going on.

5967
02:41:38,740 --> 02:41:39,040
You know,

5968
02:41:39,040 --> 02:41:40,180
this is what's going on.

5969
02:41:40,181 --> 02:41:43,540
But we are connecting with like minded
people in a way that's never been

5970
02:41:43,541 --> 02:41:45,790
available before and
it's starting a network.

5971
02:41:45,900 --> 02:41:46,081
You know,

5972
02:41:46,081 --> 02:41:47,890
it's not just a network with podcasts,

5973
02:41:47,891 --> 02:41:50,110
with the death squad podcast
and years of lavender hour,

5974
02:41:50,260 --> 02:41:50,630
you know,

5975
02:41:50,630 --> 02:41:51,580
[inaudible] that.

5976
02:41:51,581 --> 02:41:54,820
But it's also a network with all these
fucking people on Facebook and all these

5977
02:41:54,821 --> 02:41:57,970
people on Twitter and these people that
I met in Australia that came to the show

5978
02:41:57,971 --> 02:41:58,804
and these people that are,

5979
02:41:58,900 --> 02:42:02,110
I've got to show this weekend or
this week rather a Wednesday night.

5980
02:42:02,620 --> 02:42:03,100
Yeah,

5981
02:42:03,100 --> 02:42:03,731
Wednesday night.

5982
02:42:03,731 --> 02:42:05,080
I'm at the Louisville,

5983
02:42:05,081 --> 02:42:06,370
Kentucky Improv.

5984
02:42:06,490 --> 02:42:07,360
That's my next gig.

5985
02:42:07,600 --> 02:42:08,261
And that's another one.

5986
02:42:08,261 --> 02:42:10,870
This is all promoted just
strictly straight from,

5987
02:42:10,900 --> 02:42:11,590
from Twitter.

5988
02:42:11,590 --> 02:42:12,371
You're going to know on there,

5989
02:42:12,371 --> 02:42:13,120
man,

5990
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:14,260
I'm sure we're going to have fun.

5991
02:42:14,500 --> 02:42:15,340
We have fun everywhere.

5992
02:42:15,341 --> 02:42:16,174
And that's the deal.

5993
02:42:16,240 --> 02:42:16,451
I mean,

5994
02:42:16,451 --> 02:42:17,680
I have fun in Australia,

5995
02:42:17,681 --> 02:42:18,350
I have fun.

5996
02:42:18,350 --> 02:42:18,580
We,

5997
02:42:18,580 --> 02:42:22,570
we were bringing these people all together
and people are getting connected and

5998
02:42:22,571 --> 02:42:24,030
there's a movement going on and it's,

5999
02:42:24,031 --> 02:42:24,460
yeah,

6000
02:42:24,460 --> 02:42:26,410
there's a movement of the mind.

6001
02:42:26,440 --> 02:42:26,741
There's,

6002
02:42:26,741 --> 02:42:30,790
this is an opportunity for people to
find and connect with likeminded people

6003
02:42:30,880 --> 02:42:32,470
about things that they
thought were interesting.

6004
02:42:32,560 --> 02:42:34,960
That fucking was not
available just a year ago.

6005
02:42:34,990 --> 02:42:35,201
Right.

6006
02:42:35,201 --> 02:42:35,471
You know,

6007
02:42:35,471 --> 02:42:37,540
it was not available two
years ago or three years ago.

6008
02:42:37,720 --> 02:42:39,370
It's like this new,

6009
02:42:39,400 --> 02:42:40,660
this new thought,

6010
02:42:40,661 --> 02:42:43,180
this new hive mind that's being created.

6011
02:42:43,300 --> 02:42:43,751
And it's not,

6012
02:42:43,751 --> 02:42:43,951
I'm not,

6013
02:42:43,951 --> 02:42:45,340
I'm not taking responsibility for it.

6014
02:42:45,341 --> 02:42:45,501
It's,

6015
02:42:45,501 --> 02:42:46,990
it's creating itself.

6016
02:42:47,050 --> 02:42:49,420
It's always been things that I've always
been interested and it's always been

6017
02:42:49,421 --> 02:42:50,620
things that you've always
been interested in.

6018
02:42:50,840 --> 02:42:55,250
It's refining and altering the way that
I think about the world because I'll say

6019
02:42:55,251 --> 02:42:56,084
yes,

6020
02:42:56,210 --> 02:43:00,830
I'll obviously say some pretty stupid
shit that I haven't thought about and I'll

6021
02:43:00,831 --> 02:43:02,070
get an email or,

6022
02:43:02,160 --> 02:43:02,430
or,

6023
02:43:02,430 --> 02:43:05,340
or five Facebook messages
correcting whatever fact.

6024
02:43:05,470 --> 02:43:05,940
Uh,

6025
02:43:05,940 --> 02:43:07,040
and usually very politely,

6026
02:43:07,090 --> 02:43:07,511
usually.

6027
02:43:07,511 --> 02:43:07,850
Yeah,

6028
02:43:07,850 --> 02:43:08,541
very politely.

6029
02:43:08,541 --> 02:43:09,110
And it's just like,

6030
02:43:09,110 --> 02:43:09,381
oh,

6031
02:43:09,381 --> 02:43:09,890
okay,

6032
02:43:09,890 --> 02:43:10,220
well,

6033
02:43:10,220 --> 02:43:12,220
and then and then I'll find myself walking

6034
02:43:12,580 --> 02:43:13,181
the next day,

6035
02:43:13,181 --> 02:43:14,310
like walking my dog and just

6036
02:43:14,430 --> 02:43:16,170
thinking about that that way,

6037
02:43:16,171 --> 02:43:18,350
that then my new version of the uniform.

6038
02:43:18,360 --> 02:43:18,901
Absolutely.

6039
02:43:18,901 --> 02:43:19,441
And that's that.

6040
02:43:19,441 --> 02:43:20,370
That's the evolution.

6041
02:43:20,920 --> 02:43:21,310
Yes.

6042
02:43:21,310 --> 02:43:21,841
It's ours.

6043
02:43:21,841 --> 02:43:22,620
It's theirs.

6044
02:43:22,620 --> 02:43:23,190
It's we,

6045
02:43:23,190 --> 02:43:23,461
you know,

6046
02:43:23,461 --> 02:43:23,641
I've,

6047
02:43:23,641 --> 02:43:26,100
I've said this many times that I've
talked to a bunch of people that have said

6048
02:43:26,101 --> 02:43:27,390
they don't know anybody like us.

6049
02:43:27,510 --> 02:43:29,940
They don't ever have the chance to
have these opportunities to have these

6050
02:43:29,941 --> 02:43:31,890
conversations with people
that are near them,

6051
02:43:31,891 --> 02:43:35,400
but now they get to sit in
on these conversations and
it's changing the way they

6052
02:43:35,401 --> 02:43:35,820
think.

6053
02:43:35,820 --> 02:43:37,020
What changes the way I think too,

6054
02:43:37,021 --> 02:43:40,530
because we're having these conversations
on a really regular basis where we know

6055
02:43:40,531 --> 02:43:41,760
we're broadcasting them,

6056
02:43:41,761 --> 02:43:43,770
so we know a lot of the
shit we say we have to be,

6057
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:45,660
we have to check it and
you have to correct it.

6058
02:43:45,661 --> 02:43:46,950
We have to do some Google searching,

6059
02:43:46,951 --> 02:43:48,690
we have to consider our options,

6060
02:43:48,810 --> 02:43:50,490
consider the the contrary argument,

6061
02:43:50,560 --> 02:43:53,260
and then we'll get all sorts
of different cool comments and,

6062
02:43:53,400 --> 02:43:54,930
and different links and different things.

6063
02:43:55,050 --> 02:43:57,210
Here's another thing that they're
doing on my message board.

6064
02:43:57,211 --> 02:43:59,220
Every time there's a podcast,

6065
02:43:59,340 --> 02:44:03,000
they'll start a thread where they
analyze the podcast as it goes along,

6066
02:44:03,001 --> 02:44:06,090
and then they'll put
links up and videos up to,

6067
02:44:06,510 --> 02:44:07,343
we're talking about.

6068
02:44:07,410 --> 02:44:08,550
It's fucking amazing,

6069
02:44:08,551 --> 02:44:09,000
man.

6070
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:10,500
And it's all natural.

6071
02:44:10,501 --> 02:44:11,970
It's all just a natural,

6072
02:44:12,030 --> 02:44:12,221
uh,

6073
02:44:12,221 --> 02:44:12,301
uh,

6074
02:44:12,301 --> 02:44:12,810
correct.

6075
02:44:12,810 --> 02:44:13,643
It's all just,

6076
02:44:13,740 --> 02:44:15,450
it's just grown out of interest and,

6077
02:44:15,451 --> 02:44:15,691
and,

6078
02:44:15,691 --> 02:44:15,961
and,

6079
02:44:15,961 --> 02:44:16,231
and,

6080
02:44:16,231 --> 02:44:20,040
and it spreads and then people contribute
to it and then it gets larger and

6081
02:44:20,041 --> 02:44:20,730
larger.

6082
02:44:20,730 --> 02:44:20,911
I mean,

6083
02:44:20,911 --> 02:44:21,630
it really is.

6084
02:44:21,630 --> 02:44:22,530
There's a hive mind.

6085
02:44:23,130 --> 02:44:23,941
It's going on bitches.

6086
02:44:23,941 --> 02:44:24,591
It's going on right now.

6087
02:44:24,591 --> 02:44:25,300
And that's what we're gonna do.

6088
02:44:25,300 --> 02:44:25,511
Can I,

6089
02:44:25,511 --> 02:44:27,580
can I say once something
I've got coming up?

6090
02:44:27,581 --> 02:44:28,414
Can I have no,

6091
02:44:28,940 --> 02:44:30,320
no plugs.

6092
02:44:30,820 --> 02:44:31,601
Capitalism.

6093
02:44:31,601 --> 02:44:32,200
Boy,

6094
02:44:32,200 --> 02:44:33,370
comedy is dead.

6095
02:44:33,430 --> 02:44:33,701
Yes.

6096
02:44:33,701 --> 02:44:34,061
When is it,

6097
02:44:34,061 --> 02:44:34,781
is Thursday?

6098
02:44:34,781 --> 02:44:37,750
Thursday we kept with gay
this gate and it's out.

6099
02:44:37,840 --> 02:44:38,740
It's out a funeral,

6100
02:44:38,741 --> 02:44:39,240
by the way.

6101
02:44:39,240 --> 02:44:40,140
Did it not a role,

6102
02:44:40,240 --> 02:44:40,720
excuse me,

6103
02:44:40,720 --> 02:44:41,230
cemetery.

6104
02:44:41,230 --> 02:44:41,801
How many is that?

6105
02:44:41,801 --> 02:44:42,634
Is it the holiday?

6106
02:44:43,030 --> 02:44:43,300
Well,

6107
02:44:43,300 --> 02:44:43,530
no,

6108
02:44:43,530 --> 02:44:44,950
not ever live funeral.

6109
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:45,340
And every,

6110
02:44:45,340 --> 02:44:46,840
occasionally someone will die on stage.

6111
02:44:46,870 --> 02:44:47,411
It's in,

6112
02:44:47,411 --> 02:44:50,260
it's in a masonic lodge at the
Hollywood forever cemetery.

6113
02:44:50,530 --> 02:44:50,861
Uh,

6114
02:44:50,861 --> 02:44:54,340
and this was the address
6,000 Santa Monica Boulevard.

6115
02:44:54,490 --> 02:44:56,140
And we've got Neil hamburger.

6116
02:44:56,141 --> 02:44:56,441
Yes.

6117
02:44:56,441 --> 02:44:57,011
You haven't seen him,

6118
02:44:57,011 --> 02:44:57,730
you have to see him.

6119
02:44:57,730 --> 02:44:59,530
But this guy I'm really excited about.

6120
02:44:59,531 --> 02:45:01,450
We have Mary Lynn Rice Cub from 24.

6121
02:45:01,690 --> 02:45:02,291
Yeah.

6122
02:45:02,291 --> 02:45:03,280
And we've got a,

6123
02:45:03,580 --> 02:45:05,370
this guy I'm seeking for that
book I just gave you this,

6124
02:45:07,220 --> 02:45:08,640
you said read that on stage.

6125
02:45:09,740 --> 02:45:11,080
Ah,

6126
02:45:11,090 --> 02:45:11,561
there's a,

6127
02:45:11,561 --> 02:45:12,071
there's a,

6128
02:45:12,071 --> 02:45:12,700
uh,

6129
02:45:12,700 --> 02:45:14,560
a guy named caisters Stross.

6130
02:45:14,590 --> 02:45:17,110
He's the Yoyo Guy who
invaded all these uh,

6131
02:45:17,370 --> 02:45:17,470
uh,

6132
02:45:17,470 --> 02:45:18,130
TVs.

6133
02:45:18,130 --> 02:45:18,490
Oh,

6134
02:45:18,490 --> 02:45:19,570
I saw that.

6135
02:45:19,571 --> 02:45:20,980
And he's going to be performing on,

6136
02:45:20,981 --> 02:45:22,270
explain that real quick.

6137
02:45:22,271 --> 02:45:22,980
This would be the end.

6138
02:45:22,980 --> 02:45:23,860
It's because this guy,

6139
02:45:24,310 --> 02:45:25,890
he went on these shows,

6140
02:45:25,900 --> 02:45:29,380
he pretended that he knows how
to do the Yo Yo yo for kids.

6141
02:45:29,410 --> 02:45:31,600
You did a character on
these morning shows.

6142
02:45:31,780 --> 02:45:34,780
He apparently you could just send them
a letter and Sam traveling through

6143
02:45:34,781 --> 02:45:38,740
schools doing environmental
lessons and using Yoyos to do it.

6144
02:45:38,950 --> 02:45:40,120
And it kind of seems like a nice,

6145
02:45:40,121 --> 02:45:40,781
good feel.

6146
02:45:40,781 --> 02:45:41,614
Good story.

6147
02:45:41,740 --> 02:45:42,670
And so they invite him,

6148
02:45:42,671 --> 02:45:43,090
man,

6149
02:45:43,090 --> 02:45:44,980
he's wearing this ridiculous outfit.

6150
02:45:45,100 --> 02:45:45,740
He's a,

6151
02:45:45,740 --> 02:45:46,061
uh,

6152
02:45:46,061 --> 02:45:49,660
he's a a character actor on the level
within like when Kaufman would do his

6153
02:45:49,661 --> 02:45:49,961
stuff,

6154
02:45:49,961 --> 02:45:54,961
he's that fucking good and he's this
adult guy who comes on stage with the Yoyo

6155
02:45:56,290 --> 02:45:59,140
Eric and doesn't really get to the Yoyo.

6156
02:45:59,141 --> 02:46:02,450
They finally ended up having
to ask him to do it every day

6157
02:46:03,970 --> 02:46:05,980
and every time they ask him to do it,

6158
02:46:06,220 --> 02:46:07,780
something awful goes wrong.

6159
02:46:07,781 --> 02:46:09,010
The Yoyo breaks,

6160
02:46:09,110 --> 02:46:10,160
he can't Yo yo.

6161
02:46:12,990 --> 02:46:14,400
And he just leaves them
hanging everything.

6162
02:46:14,410 --> 02:46:14,660
Well,

6163
02:46:14,660 --> 02:46:17,450
it's awkward and they want
to like make him feel better,

6164
02:46:17,451 --> 02:46:18,680
but he's like each time,

6165
02:46:18,710 --> 02:46:21,620
like he like he's clearly like out of it.

6166
02:46:21,621 --> 02:46:21,801
You,

6167
02:46:21,801 --> 02:46:21,990
you,

6168
02:46:21,990 --> 02:46:22,111
it,

6169
02:46:22,111 --> 02:46:23,150
it's all on youtube.

6170
02:46:23,210 --> 02:46:23,901
What's his name again?

6171
02:46:23,901 --> 02:46:24,830
Hey straws.

6172
02:46:24,940 --> 02:46:25,880
S S t.

6173
02:46:25,881 --> 02:46:27,170
R.

6174
02:46:27,170 --> 02:46:27,170
A.

6175
02:46:27,170 --> 02:46:27,170
S.

6176
02:46:27,170 --> 02:46:27,410
S.

6177
02:46:27,410 --> 02:46:31,220
The Yoyo Guy just looked at a
straws like case dress did letter k.

6178
02:46:31,250 --> 02:46:31,671
K?

6179
02:46:31,671 --> 02:46:32,110
Yeah,

6180
02:46:32,110 --> 02:46:33,490
the letterK and then s.

6181
02:46:33,491 --> 02:46:37,420
T.

6182
02:46:37,420 --> 02:46:37,420
R.

6183
02:46:37,420 --> 02:46:37,420
A.

6184
02:46:37,420 --> 02:46:37,420
U.

6185
02:46:37,420 --> 02:46:37,420
S.

6186
02:46:37,420 --> 02:46:37,420
S.

6187
02:46:37,420 --> 02:46:37,420
S.

6188
02:46:37,420 --> 02:46:37,420
T.

6189
02:46:37,420 --> 02:46:37,420
R.

6190
02:46:37,420 --> 02:46:37,420
A.

6191
02:46:37,420 --> 02:46:37,420
S.

6192
02:46:37,420 --> 02:46:37,420
A.

6193
02:46:37,420 --> 02:46:37,420
S.

6194
02:46:37,420 --> 02:46:37,420
S.

6195
02:46:37,420 --> 02:46:37,520
Yeah.

6196
02:46:37,520 --> 02:46:39,070
And what is he going to do with your show?

6197
02:46:39,100 --> 02:46:41,770
He's got a show based around
the character is going to,

6198
02:46:41,771 --> 02:46:44,740
his character will be there and
he does a Yoyo show for everybody.

6199
02:46:44,800 --> 02:46:46,000
So it's basically the same thing.

6200
02:46:46,020 --> 02:46:47,620
It's like kind of,

6201
02:46:47,650 --> 02:46:47,801
well,

6202
02:46:47,801 --> 02:46:48,221
you don't know,

6203
02:46:48,221 --> 02:46:48,520
right?

6204
02:46:48,520 --> 02:46:48,701
Well,

6205
02:46:48,701 --> 02:46:48,851
no,

6206
02:46:48,851 --> 02:46:50,580
I saw him doing it as
you've been doing standard,

6207
02:46:50,620 --> 02:46:50,830
right?

6208
02:46:50,830 --> 02:46:53,130
Or is he just doing this kind
of weird performance art thing?

6209
02:46:53,240 --> 02:46:54,100
Performance art.

6210
02:46:54,130 --> 02:46:54,963
How long have you been doing it?

6211
02:46:55,560 --> 02:46:56,320
Uh,

6212
02:46:56,320 --> 02:47:01,270
he's obviously been doing some form of
character comedy for a while because he's

6213
02:47:01,271 --> 02:47:05,020
too good at it to not have fucking
practice or it could be crazy.

6214
02:47:05,150 --> 02:47:05,350
Right.

6215
02:47:05,350 --> 02:47:05,660
He's out.

6216
02:47:05,660 --> 02:47:05,921
Met Him.

6217
02:47:05,921 --> 02:47:06,371
He's not,

6218
02:47:06,371 --> 02:47:07,580
he's a super nice guy.

6219
02:47:07,581 --> 02:47:09,430
He's like a really cool drugs.

6220
02:47:09,670 --> 02:47:11,380
No Charlie Sheen.

6221
02:47:11,720 --> 02:47:12,850
Do you wanna hear a little bit over?

6222
02:47:12,860 --> 02:47:13,430
Yeah.

6223
02:47:13,430 --> 02:47:15,280
What us now we're done.

6224
02:47:15,400 --> 02:47:16,250
It's this fucking thing.

6225

Thank you.

02:48:31,480 --> 02:48:32,410
the UFC blackout.

6284
02:48:32,411 --> 02:48:33,850
Maybe that's super blackout one.

6285
02:48:33,910 --> 02:48:35,770
I'm gonna step in and intervene.

6286
02:48:35,771 --> 02:48:36,010
And Joe,

6287
02:48:36,010 --> 02:48:37,680
you got to listen to it
at least before you ate.

6288
02:48:37,700 --> 02:48:38,890
Gij It's hilarious.

6289
02:48:40,270 --> 02:48:44,050
Gets drunk with crazy broads and like
literally they get hammered and slobber

6290
02:48:44,051 --> 02:48:46,480
over each other and
threatened to kill each other.

6291
02:48:48,200 --> 02:48:49,730
Why would anyone want to watch that?

6292
02:48:50,100 --> 02:48:50,501
All right,

6293
02:48:50,501 --> 02:48:50,920

Kentucky.

6303
02:48:58,931 --> 02:49:00,520
And maybe I could talk
you out of escaping,

6304
02:49:02,260 --> 02:49:05,050
creating something
better in Louisville by,

6305
02:49:05,090 --> 02:49:05,950
that'd be a bit of an okay.

6306
02:49:06,250 --> 02:49:06,930
All right.

6307
02:49:06,930 --> 02:49:07,763
