1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,000
The joe rogan experience watching
and I'm gonna say this in.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,410
Then the idea's going to be there.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,380
All the business guys
take off their jackets.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,900
You know they have the shirt and ties
and they throw him over the back of their

5
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:10,734
chairs.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,510
I'm a new invent suit.

7
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:13,770
Jackets that aren't real ones.

8
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,600
They just cover the back of your chair.

9
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,420
So you see that as a piece of year suit,

10
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:19,620
but you don't have to wear the jacket.

11
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:21,060
What the fuck is wrong with you?

12
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:22,180
You got to tackle brilliant,

13
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,330
brilliant idea.

14
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:25,420
You're talking about signage.

15
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,820
Jackets are never a good idea.

16
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:27,061
John,

17
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:27,820
half run.

18
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,930
They're going to go in the back
conference room yourself too long.

19
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:35,931
Virtual fist pump you jackets that
are going to go on the back of,

20
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:36,960
because here's the thing,

21
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:37,711
when you do those,

22
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:40,260
you don't have to wear dress
pants because they can't it.

23
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,400
They're like newscasters.

24
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,900
So the new look,

25
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:44,160
you can go board shorts,

26
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,110
flip flops,

27
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,010
maybe a nice shirt with a tie,

28
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,190
fake jacket cover over the thing.

29
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:52,620
You look like you're wearing a suit
and you've got probably talent,

30
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,570
brain dog dies or a NASA.

31
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,720
In the beginning of the show brain doctor,

32
00:00:57,721 --> 00:01:00,540
you need to go see one
telling you you're going to,

33
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,500
you're going to see it.

34
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,880
You're all gonna throw it out there.

35
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:05,550
John Heffron I'd be willing to
bet you an insane amount of money.

36
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,420
That fake jackets that you put on the
back of your study will exempt to catch on

37
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,651
because he will exist.

38
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:11,490
Cause I'll create them.

39
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,390
You will.

40
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,320
They will exist and they will be a money
pit of disastrous proportions for I

41
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:19,140
need a sanction as your direct message.

42
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:19,351
Me,

43
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:20,520
I need a seamstress.

44
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,120
What is it like dealing with those people
in that world and doing like squeaky

45
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:28,050
clean comedy only and not being able to
take any chances up there or go into any

46
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:28,890
weird directions.

47
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,723
What does that like?

48
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,430
I've always done that type of comedy so
it's not weird you your Carmoney has,

49
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,630
I mean I'm,

50
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,870
I'm an adult but I'm not,

51
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:37,501
you know,

52
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:38,830
I don't get ever super grand.

53
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,420
I'm,

54
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,290
I believe you can turn a clean bit dirty,

55
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,720
just buy things then vice versa.

56
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,560
But yet you are one of the most perverted
people I've ever met my wife up with

57
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:49,920
that.

58
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,640
Plus I think it's weird when you
have jobs that then affect you.

59
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:56,130
Like when I used to do
morning radio with Bonaduce,

60
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,970
we are on a soccer mom station.

61
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,550
You guys run a soccer mom station.

62
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,593
We were like,

63
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,470
well Danny tried to get in a
fight at a matchbox 20 concert.

64
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,560
So that shows you what kind of enhancing,

65
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:10,011
try match.

66
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:11,750
But in a fight and a matchbox,

67
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,683
he,

68
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,621
it was a great,

69
00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:16,500
he took off his shirt and was
going to fight the entire row.

70
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:18,360
J J at Pine Knob.

71
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,500
Why would the shirt off?

72
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,300
Because he cleaned the bathroom.

73
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,640
I think this is back when Danny partied.

74
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:27,390
I think Danny met up with the
listener and the disappeared.

75
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,180
Oh,

76
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:28,831
whatever happened.

77
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:30,660
So he came back in an altered state?

78
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,440
No,

79
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,190
he was never that type of guy liquor.

80
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,020
I think we resigned and he's talking,

81
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,430
he's talking about this story.

82
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:39,111
So I'm not thinking of,

83
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:40,650
but it was that date rape drug.

84
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:40,781
What?

85
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:42,300
Everything he did GHB.

86
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:42,810
Yeah,

87
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,140
yeah,

88
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,381
yeah.

89
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:44,214
So yeah,

90
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,550
but,

91
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,630
but Danny scar tissue,

92
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:46,650
he did admit to all this stuff.

93
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:47,280
I don't know how that guy,

94
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,971
but so he did.

95
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:49,260
So then he came out crazy.

96
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:51,060
Did you say Danny is scar tissue?

97
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:51,871
His whole body is,

98
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,450
or there's no way you can be alive
with all the stuff that he's done.

99
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,350
Really?

100
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,970
There's no way you,

101
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,970
you have to be totally embalmed.

102
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,150
What did they do that with frogs?

103
00:02:59,290 --> 00:02:59,550
The,

104
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,730
the body body's preserved.

105
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,300
Yeah.

106
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,050
Formaldehyde.

107
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:02,350
Yeah,

108
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:02,770
his,

109
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,790
that's his entire body.

110
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,540
Really?

111
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:04,811
Oh yeah.

112
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:05,441
He's a Zombie.

113
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:05,801
You can't,

114
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:06,634
he's not alive.

115
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,503
What's wrong with him?

116
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,150
He's just done so much stuff to his body.

117
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,590
What was it like working with that guy?

118
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,540
How long have you worked with them?

119
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,680
Different Kessel five years.

120
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,120
Five years on the radio.

121
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,240
Every morning I get up every
15 in the morning and Michigan,

122
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,970
which means that's when I
scraped off the ice on my thing.

123
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:23,410
Drove 45 minutes.

124
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,370
How many months a year is it snowing like
that and Michigan and started December

125
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:29,170
and go to like May.

126
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:29,171
June.

127
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:29,411
Yeah.

128
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:29,801
I mean it's,

129
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:31,930
so that's a long drive.

130
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:32,621
A June,

131
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:33,550
seven months.

132
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,010
April.

133
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:36,410
Yeah.

134
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,850
Half the half the year
after the cold and crappy.

135
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:40,390
Yeah.

136
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,870
Okay.

137
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,940
So cold and crappy.

138
00:03:41,941 --> 00:03:43,120
You get up three 30 in the morning,

139
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,470
you're doing standup at night still.

140
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,251
Yeah,

141
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:46,390
round town.

142
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,313
Um,

143
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,820
but it was awesome cause
I would sell out stuff.

144
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,050
Right?

145
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,100
I mean there were some benefits.

146
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:53,500
I wasn't the course and that was 25,

147
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:54,191
26.

148
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:59,050
Why would you ever want to sleep
then you go radio bar appearances,

149
00:03:59,530 --> 00:03:59,861
you know,

150
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:01,450
like I was that guy movie premieres,

151
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:02,500
but he got paid a lot of money.

152
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,120
How crazy was daddy?

153
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,170
Ah,

154
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,040
beyond crazy?

155
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,940
Because the thing with Danny as you never
knew which guy you were going to get.

156
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,850
You can have a guy that you work
with that's a consistent ass,

157
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,830
but at least then you know how to tip toe.

158
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,733
Other Times,

159
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,030
Dan,

160
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,400
you'll be the coolest human
being you've ever met.

161
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,790
And then you come in the
next day and you'd go,

162
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,470
he's going to literally slit my throat.

163
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,000
The only advantage,

164
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,920
I mean did it.

165
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,321
Now we're,

166
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:28,080
we're really good friends and at first he,

167
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:29,050
he hated me.

168
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,520
He wanted to hate you.

169
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,840
Um,

170
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,040
well,

171
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,990
I never did radio before I met him.

172
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,050
I was just a comic round town and I
didn't know how to talk to that person.

173
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,850
It's try having a conversation with him.

174
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:40,450
It's tough.

175
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,100
So imagine being a 22 year old kid,

176
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:42,670
not,

177
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:42,851
you know,

178
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:44,120
David [inaudible].

179
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:44,650
And I was like,

180
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:44,771
yeah,

181
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:46,060
but one time I,

182
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,541
you know,

183
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,250
I just didn't have my rhythm.

184
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,000
I just didn't know.

185
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,760
So he hated you because,

186
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,110
oh,

187
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,943
hated me.

188
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,910
Hated working with you.

189
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,050
Hated just,

190
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,913
yeah.

191
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,460
Yeah.

192
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,300
They didn't want to work with you.

193
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,950
He didn't want to know why did we fired?

194
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,810
I just moved back from Los Angeles.

195
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,700
So I moved to from Detroit to Los Angeles
and then got that job and move back to

196
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:07,990
Detroit and then got fired
maybe three or four weeks later.

197
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,700
And then did he get you fired?

198
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,271
Yeah,

199
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,551
he,

200
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:13,540
he got me fired and then we
went to Chicago together.

201
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,280
It was odd for some weird thing.

202
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,530
And then we,

203
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,170
he didn't suddenly liked me and then,

204
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,310
then I was on the shelf.

205
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,770
You know what,

206
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,560
what are you talking about?

207
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,780
We did a radio show
together for some reason.

208
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:27,580
Why we were doing it in Chicago.

209
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:28,990
Something clicked where he's like,

210
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,141
oh,

211
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:30,120
I get you now have friend.

212
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:30,790
Okay,

213
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,450
you're in.

214
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,440
Then it was so,

215
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:33,560
I'm so confused.

216
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,240
Okay.

217
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,040
You started off together in Michigan.

218
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,060
You did a radio show.

219
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:39,710
He got you fired me fired condo.

220
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,930
They were going to give me,

221
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,660
you know,

222
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,461
did you go to Chicago?

223
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:43,910
What does the Chicago trip boat?

224
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,960
I got fired on a Friday and we were going
to go to Chicago on Monday to do a hid

225
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,400
this loop.

226
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,450
The loop in Chicago.

227
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:52,930
Okay,

228
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,470
so we doing it as a permanent
gig or the Andes thing was a,

229
00:05:57,471 --> 00:05:58,610
I can't believe they did that.

230
00:05:58,611 --> 00:05:59,150
You know,

231
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,380
why don't you come to Chicago?

232
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:02,480
We'll do the show Monday so puts you up.

233
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,120
I didn't know.

234
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,830
Still confuses.

235
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,790
He's still doing a show in
Michigan and he does a shelter.

236
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:07,970
Yes.

237
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,540
He would do morning shows in
Detroit afternoon in Chicago,

238
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,460
so he would get on a southwest flight.

239
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,331
Wait a minute.

240
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:16,460
He did a show every day in two markets.

241
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,240
Yes.

242
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,100
Oh my God.

243
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,650
Get on a southwest flight and
fly from Detroit to Chicago.

244
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,170
Do the thing and then
get on another flight,

245
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:24,801
fly back.

246
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,120
Holy Shit.

247
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,600
Yeah.

248
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,560
Every day.

249
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:27,651
Yeah.

250
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:30,200
He did that for a couple months and then,

251
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:30,891
you know,

252
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,570
then he figured out technology but keep,

253
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,240
you know where they can ISD and
at where he could do it in thing.

254
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:37,790
But he was doing that every day is insane.

255
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,600
Yeah.

256
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:38,900
Yeah.

257
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,210
How long is the flight in?

258
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:41,721
Minutes?

259
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:42,171
20 minutes.

260
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:43,070
40 F yeah.

261
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,300
So it's going to Vegas like flying to
Vegas and he would do it every day back

262
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:49,160
and forth and then do his radio show.

263
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:51,680
Holy Shit in Chicago.

264
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:51,860
Yeah.

265
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,560
You gotta give the Guy Credit for
that and I wonder why he was on drugs.

266
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,201
So he got,

267
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:56,390
had to be on drugs to do that.

268
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:57,440
So I was fired,

269
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:58,880
but he didn't tell me that it was,

270
00:06:58,881 --> 00:06:59,211
he was like,

271
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,320
I can't believe they did that.

272
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:00,501
I,

273
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:01,311
that's like,

274
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:01,940
so he didn't,

275
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,710
I didn't know you that he got fired.

276
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,431
So it goes,

277
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:06,200
why don't you just come
to Chicago this weekend?

278
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:06,431
We'll,

279
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:06,951
we'll party.

280
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:07,551
That just sucks.

281
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:08,001
Have friend.

282
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:08,691
But you know,

283
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:09,020
well,

284
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,890
so he's kind of like,

285
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:10,820
probably felt guilty.

286
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:14,380
I'll let your party in Chicago with
me and then you're gone for a light.

287
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,243
Okay.

288
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,970
Did the show with them on that Monday.

289
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:17,690
And he's like,

290
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:17,991
you know what,

291
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:19,760
I'm going to make a call like we had,

292
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,680
cause he never listened to me.

293
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,010
Well,

294
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:22,491
you know what I mean?

295
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:24,620
Like what's the problem on the show
if you would just listen to me.

296
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:25,454
He knows.

297
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,211
So anyway,

298
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:26,871
long story short,

299
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:27,700
I came back and you're like,

300
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:27,921
Eh,

301
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:28,260
you know,

302
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,900
we won't fire you but we'll give you,

303
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,220
you got to take a pay cut.

304
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,450
Because I was making,

305
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:33,680
you know,

306
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,131
keep in mind,

307
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:34,731
I'm 23,

308
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:39,020
24 morning radio in
Detroit making $150,000.

309
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,820
Wow.

310
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,041
I mean,

311
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,110
that's like $1 million to a 23,

312
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:42,740
24 years.

313
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,380
Was this because why were
they giving you a pay cut?

314
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,243
What are they doing?

315
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:47,661
You know,

316
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:48,321
because I was,

317
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:52,250
I had no management or anything
and they're a huge corporation.

318
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:52,550
They're like,

319
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,660
you get the Gig in the first place.

320
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,710
Uh,

321
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,030
this huge radio guy,

322
00:07:56,031 --> 00:07:57,410
Dick Curtin in Detroit,

323
00:07:57,411 --> 00:08:01,040
was leaving the radio station and
he suggested to that management,

324
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,450
you need to bring this Heprin kid in.

325
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:02,991
Keep in mind,

326
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:04,160
I'm just starting college,

327
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:04,941
you know,

328
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:06,440
so then they go and you know,

329
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:08,060
Dick knows your most standup comedian.

330
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:08,241
Yeah.

331
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:11,900
And it was on a show and he was probably
the most famous radio guy in Detroit.

332
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,480
So they hired me just because
of that and put me with Danny.

333
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,363
But Danny,

334
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,930
how crazy.

335
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,500
[inaudible] he's the guy who,

336
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:19,334
and I've told him,

337
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,210
well anyway,

338
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,650
he's the one who got me into fighting.

339
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,903
Um,

340
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,040
he was really in the boxing and stuff.

341
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:29,340
So then what he did was he came to the
radio station and he had like headgear

342
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,313
cups,

343
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,330
a boxing gloves and says,

344
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,700
you know,

345
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,480
I'm friends with Jackie Callan,

346
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,870
we're going to go to her
place and we're going to,

347
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,670
I want you to learn to box so
I have somebody to spar with.

348
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:42,590
So he bought me all my appointments.

349
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,210
He bought me all my equipment,

350
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,900
got me crazy coaches and goes after it
and I'm going to take you out of box.

351
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:48,734
So I have somebody to,

352
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,210
and we're going to spar everyday from,

353
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,040
from 12 to 12 to three.

354
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,053
That's ridiculous.

355
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,890
So long time to get good at boxing kid,

356
00:08:54,891 --> 00:08:55,621
just start sparring.

357
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:56,640
Someone had been doing it forever.

358
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,300
Yeah.

359
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,051
So I,

360
00:08:58,051 --> 00:09:00,750
so I got the stuff and then um,

361
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,730
then me and Danny fought and I would
never been more afraid of my entire life.

362
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:06,820
Like the,

363
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,890
there's a thing about fighting.

364
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:09,030
You can be a really good,

365
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:09,751
you go to class,

366
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:10,350
you want to think,

367
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,250
but you have to have that thing in you
that makes you want to kill people,

368
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,900
which I've never had.

369
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,940
I enjoy fighting and I
learned learning stuff,

370
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:19,330
but I don't have that morale.

371
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,573
There's that thing.

372
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,960
Danny is a complete psycho.

373
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,630
He completely has that
thing and we'll kill you.

374
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,120
Then that's when that shortly after,

375
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:28,620
that's when he gave me a concussion.

376
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,940
Hit me right in the back of the head,

377
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,230
um,

378
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,370
to have people punching on you,

379
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:32,670
dude.

380
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:32,801
Yeah,

381
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:33,820
I know God.

382
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,740
That's right.

383
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,750
Danny Bonaduce though.

384
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,930
That's when we,

385
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,000
so he hit me in the back of the head.

386
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,080
I went home,

387
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,840
the girl I was dating at the time
comes to my apartment and goes,

388
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:46,380
why'd you buy a VCR on my kitchen
table from best buy out a VCR?

389
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:46,710
I'm like,

390
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,610
I didn't buy a VCR.

391
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,211
She's like,

392
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:48,420
yeah,

393
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:48,571
well,

394
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:49,510
who's his Atago?

395
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,370
I Dunno,

396
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,970
looked saw the credit card
receipt was my signature,

397
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:54,900
but this was weird.

398
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:57,570
This was in the nineties when
people bought DVD players.

399
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,090
So I actually went
backwards in technology.

400
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,220
Don't remember buying the VCR.

401
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,300
She took me to the hospital and then the
guy did the stand up on one foot thing

402
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,160
and I fell over and he's like,

403
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:08,700
what's the matter?

404
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,880
So then you know,

405
00:10:09,881 --> 00:10:14,670
I had a really world duci knocked you
backwards and the technological progress

406
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,580
with with a punch knocked
you back to the visa.

407
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,370
And then after that he
reclaim your friends.

408
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,550
Why wasn't there any anyone around
the stop you from boxing him?

409
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,260
I had no guidance.

410
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,670
That's so sad.

411
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,541
I had no guy.

412
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,550
I wish I could have been your friends.

413
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,833
I know.

414
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,863
No,

415
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,950
I had no guys don't do a chart.

416
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,040
We need you here on earth.

417
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,810
We need you for your brain.

418
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:37,644
We need you to be funny.

419
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,140
We can't have,

420
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,660
but after that Denny,

421
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,610
you know like me and stuff like that.

422
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,290
So let him punch you and fire you.

423
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,340
And he's the best guy ever.

424
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,060
Yeah.

425
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,350
You just gotta go with a bit bit of a
gauntlet and then he got a show in Philly

426
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:49,620
or something.

427
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:49,711
Yeah,

428
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:50,544
he's married.

429
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,290
He's about to get married again.

430
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,153
Who's he married?

431
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:53,701
Uh,

432
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:54,470
I don't know.

433
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,303
How do you know this?

434
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,860
I know somebody that knows somebody
who knows somebody who's marrying him.

435
00:10:58,861 --> 00:10:59,250
Yeah.

436
00:10:59,250 --> 00:10:59,920
Really?

437
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,300
Oh,

438
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:00,750
