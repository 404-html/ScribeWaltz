00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:02,701

her brother,

4
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,490
I hope she covers all that
shit out with a big Gucci Mane.

5
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:06,330
Ice Cream cone.

6
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,350
Have you seen that?

7
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,220
Yeah.

8
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,140
Gucci Mane put an ice
cream color his face.

9
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:13,801
Well,

10
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:14,490

11
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:14,701
Uh,

12
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:15,870

13
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,213
Pull up the picture.

14
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,670
She made ice cream called
baby big baby bird mans a oil.

15
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:26,010
Well,

16
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,130
oil drill on his oil drilling oil.

17
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:29,630
It's real going tattooed on his side.

18
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:31,200
It was he does he really?

19
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:32,034
Yes ma'am.

20
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,230
He's got giant stars over
his head to write insane.

21
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:35,641
Do you know,

22
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:37,020
just tattooed his fucking head?

23
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,130
Jason Ellis,

24
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,770

00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,760
got lightning bolts.

26
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,980
Maybe my ass can be on fire.

27
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,510
Gucci Mane is crazy.

28
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:49,200
Look at him.

29
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,360
He put an ice cream cone on his face.

30
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:52,200
It says burr.

31
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,213
You see it?

32
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,630
You see it on the cone.

33
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:55,890

38
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,670

39
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,061
Matt,

40
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,050

41
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:01,770

42
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,110

44
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,930
I'm going to have to get you to request
this on video and then I need you to

45
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:07,290
get,

46
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,490
I need you to write this down.

47
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,151
Come on,

48
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:09,481
man.

49
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:10,314
Just tattoo it.

50
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,700
I ain't gonna change my mind,

51
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,440
but a pecan on my face,

52
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:13,890
man.

53
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,723
Yo Dog.

54
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,070
Don't be giving me no vanilla ice cream.

55
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,660
I Hate Vanilla.

56
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,660
I want a cone of good one.

57
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,540
Like a waffle type motherfucker.

58
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,970
Them delicious cones with the
upper level that is like styrofoam,

59
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:32,964
like

60
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,310
ice cream.

61
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,820
But he's got other shit
on his face because yeah,

62
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,520
like writing on his face to

63
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,130
face is wrong.

64
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,640
You see what it says under his eye.

65
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,300
Can you read my pissed yes.

66
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,430
Things on his eye under design or
those are tattoos to all my God.

67
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,700
It looks like it's under his,

68
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,870
I said something.

69
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,800
What the fuck?

70
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:56,820
Bop or some shit.

71
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:57,940
What does that like?

72
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,213
I see.

73
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,713
What does it say?

74
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,010
1000 vague.

75
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:02,950
I don't know.

76
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,783
It's hard to say.

77
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,610
10 Times 10 with the s on the

78
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:07,861
other side.

79
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,720
He has it looks like a dove or something.

80
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,563
Well,

81
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:10,821
yeah,

82
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:11,100
that,

83
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,290
that dude is probably irrational.

84
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,393
Gucci.

85
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,860
I don't know anybody today and I'm just,

86
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:20,910
so I'm out of the loop.

87
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,870
I'm pretty out of it.

88
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,650
I know stuff that like that because
it's in the news and I know,

89
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,543
um,

90
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,110
mostly the music I grew up on.

91
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,510
I'm not aware of a lot of
the new Shit Gucci Mane.

92
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:31,560
I know because you know,

93
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,581
like a son to me.

94
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:33,414
But that's it.

95
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,890
There's so much music
that was been been made.

96
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,210
And when you think about the fact
that from 1960 whatever to today,

97
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:42,960
you know,

98
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,761
you want to go crazy,

99
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:44,940
you want to go Robert Johnson,

100
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:47,220
you can listen to some shit
recorded in the 30s and forties.

101
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:47,460
Right?

102
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:47,850
Yeah.

103
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,700
But think about that till today.

104
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,710
What a gigantic pile of music that,

105
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,140
oh,

106
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,670
there's so much out there.

107
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:57,900
What a body of work,

108
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,610
all the different musicians in the 60s,

109
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:01,480
the 70s,

110
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:01,930
the fit.

111
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,190
Oh my God.

112
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:03,520
Yeah.

113
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,870
There's so much music.

114
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,360
It's like to come up with new stuff.

115
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,910
It's like to really get me into it.

116
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:13,330
It has to be like the black keys
spent just crazy amounts of money.

117
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:15,300
Like they blow through
all nine cars and shit.

118
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:15,581
Yeah.

119
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:16,780
Like he blew through a lot of it.

120
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,040
He was on that broke,

121
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,263
um,

122
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,440
special that the air,

123
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,333
and he was just like,

124
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,600
somebody pulled up,

125
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,290
you know,

126
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,940
in like a Ferrari.

127
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,631
You're like,

128
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:25,781
yeah,

129
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:26,530
that's just hot.

130
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,730
I got to top that shit.

131
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,960
So then he would go like the day,

132
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,320
that day I got the land by
what the brains blown out man.

133
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,740
Like just to top each other guys
would just buy shit to show off,

134
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:36,340
you know,

135
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,570
to compete with each other on it.

136
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,710
They say that there's some
ungodly number of people.

137
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,740
It's like 80% of all NFL players are broke
and in bankruptcy within two years of

138
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:48,210
retiring.

139
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:48,401
It's,

140
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:49,240
it's incredible.

141
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,810
I mean,

142
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,081
you know,

143
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:51,100
the older I get,

144
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:56,101
the more I understand the younger guys
having no like 0 million cents and also

145
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:59,170
zero Fike financial Iq.

146
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:00,850
Like they don't know no 21,

147
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:01,150
they're like,

148
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,800
here's the $3 million.

149
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,340
And they're like,

150
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,173
Ooh,

151
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,230
yeah,

152
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:05,561
it's good.

153
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:07,510
This part is 22.

154
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:08,110
Yeah.

155
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,321
Yeah.

156
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:09,550
I imagine it's crazy,

157
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,290
but it's crazier when they're like,

158
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,430
he played 10,

159
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:12,881
12,

160
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:17,881
16 years like Iverson and he's blown
through like $200 million in your lives in

161
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,350
broke now.

162
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,070
Yes.

163
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,903
Yes.

164
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,013
And how old is he now?

165
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,420
He's 37 something like that.

166
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:26,800
His body's not working right anymore.

167
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:26,951
Oh,

168
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:27,880
he's the head of the MBA.

169
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,270
Yeah.

170
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,103
And he's,

171
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,410
and he's trying to play in,

172
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,390
but he's running through
well into nine figures,

173
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:34,990
you know.

174
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,830
Wow.

175
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,191
I mean,

176
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:36,341
I,

177
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:36,611
you know,

178
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:37,444
and that's,

179
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,051
that's,

180
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:38,321
you know,

181
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:38,951
you have to consider,

182
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:40,720
he made a lot of endorsements.

183
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,100
So nine figures,

184
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,680
nine figures to make seven figures.

185
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,220
Yeah.

186
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,910
Girls would be like,

187
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,361
wow,

188
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:47,380
he makes seven figures.

189
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,080
It's like,

190
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,970
can make nine,

191
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,130
nine a Bluetooth at all.

192
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,610
Yeah.

193
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,840
That shit crazy,

194
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:53,110
man.

195
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,270
Woopsies that's crazy.

196
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,570
That try really hard.

197
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,490
It's so much.

198
00:04:59,490 --> 00:04:59,720
They,

199
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,100
they interviewed one uh,

200
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,900
defensive,

201
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,250
like a guy on the,

202
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:04,030
on the,

203
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,050
the special on the,

204
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,801
the broke thing.

205
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:07,000
And he was like,

206
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:07,811
I don't know why man.

207
00:05:07,811 --> 00:05:08,500
But he was like,

208
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,730
everybody had a car wash.

209
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:16,630
He's,

210
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,460
we all had a fucking carwash man.

211
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:18,970
That shit.

212
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,530
That shit did not last.

213
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:22,750
Like we all spent money on a car.

214
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:24,550
We bought a carwash.

215
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:24,971
Yeah,

216
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:25,211
man,

217
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:26,670
you ain't got your own carwash.

218
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,300
Ah.

219
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,680
And Bart Scott had the bay,

220
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,523
he was like,

221
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,790
you buy shit is unnecessary.

222
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,730
He's not broke at all and he's
still playing and he's like,

223
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:34,990
I'm smarter with my money.

224
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,591
But he's like,

225
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:35,730
you know,

226
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,880
everybody's a stupid purchase.

227
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:37,660
I bought a coat,

228
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,860
I think it was made a wolf.

229
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,130
Okay.

230
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,340
And I

231
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,810
was like,

232
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,790
I wore that shoe once
and it was like $35,000

233
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,150
dude,

234
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,680
I got to tell you Diaz,

235
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,510
first of all,

236
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,200
he got stopped in three different airports
by like eight different people this

237
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,420
weekend.

238
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:02,571
Oh.

239
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,580
By throngs of fans who are saying fans,

240
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,660
TSA

241
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,590
at the airport.

242
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,670
And they want to check out her,

243
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:11,620
his balls for weed.

244
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:14,900
He,

245
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,710
first of all,

246
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,450
my God,

247
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,270
that is his tolerance
is it's under dunning.

248
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,613
Dude,

249
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,500
I took a quarter of a bite of an edible.

250
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,880
You're brave quarter.

251
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,360
Yeah,

252
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,661
I mean,

253
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:31,280
the very end of it and 30 minutes
later I was just out of my mind.

254
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:31,640
I mean,

255
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,510
my eyes weren't even open and I could
tell people were looking at me like,

256
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:36,200
they were like,

257
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,850
yeah,

258
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,400
when you're like,

259
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,233
I'm not hiding this,

260
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,273
this is bad.

261
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,140
And he ate of that.

262
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:44,190
He ate an entire one like that.

263
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,600
And then he's like saying
ridiculous shit like shit that I,

264
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:50,690
I feel like I get arrested
for thinking it like I,

265
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:51,111
I don't,

266
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,760
I can't play it back in my head.

267
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,601
I was like,

268
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:53,841
dude,

269
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:54,790
shut the fuck.

270
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,450
Is he saying I cannot,

271
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,550
I really can't say the
main thing that he was,

272
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,413
I can't,

273
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,530
it would be,

274
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:00,911
it was,

275
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:05,270
it's not okay to say [inaudible]
have to do with ethnic groups,

276
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,940
racial things.

277
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,350
I'll say this one in particular is awful.

278
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,010
It's so awful.

279
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,960
Like I came to spin it.

280
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,040
I can't spend a joke,

281
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,030
but you know,

282
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:20,590
I have a,

283
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,970
and this is one of the things
that I've been on about lately.

284
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,500
I have a real problem when people get
upset at people that say shit that they

285
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:28,490
don't really mean,

286
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,690
but that's awful,

287
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,620
but hilarious.

288
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:30,831
Yeah,

289
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:31,610
I agree.

290
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,180
I agree.

291
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,830
Because like look how hard we're laughing.

292
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,110
No,

293
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,660
yeah,

294
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,650
look at the picture you guys.

295
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:37,484
Yeah.

296
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,260
I don't even know what he said.

297
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,270
I don't even know what he said to you.

298
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:42,350
And I'm already laughing,

299
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,070
just crazy thinking about all the
shit he said to me in the path.

300
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,561
Of course.

301
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:46,340
Of course.

302
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:46,491
Well,

303
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:46,940
he,

304
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,200
he's going off about this thing.

305
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,071
I'm standing there,

306
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:52,970
I look like I'm gonna puke because I'm
laughing so hard because this is in the

307
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:54,590
airport and he's around people.

308
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,710
He has no sense of,

309
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:57,544
of flies,

310
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:57,840
blah,

311
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,051
blah,

312
00:07:58,051 --> 00:07:58,884
blah.

313
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,073
Shut up dude.

314
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,030
He doesn't give a fuck.

315
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,430
And I've,

316
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,100
I have tears people look at
and then he's like Tsa and uh,

317
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,681
this guy,

318
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:07,371
I look in,

319
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:08,091
the uniform,

320
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:09,170
looks over and he's like,

321
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,370
you got to look at this guy.

322
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:10,671
I'm like,

323
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:10,851
dude,

324
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:11,541
I'm all fucked up.

325
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,310
Like don't bring
attention to me right now.

326
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,570
And then that guy,

327
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,433
he's like,

328
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,110
Hey Joe,

329
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:16,941
as my big fan,

330
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:17,091
I'm like,

331
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:18,650
are you fucking kidding me right now?

332
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,850
I turn around and walk away.

333
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,211
I was like,

334
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:20,770
I'm leaving.

335
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,680
It's too high for this.

336
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,843
I walked away,

337
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:24,501
I leave him.

338
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:24,741
I'm like,

339
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:25,940
I don't want any part of the shit.

340
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,140
And I go,

341
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,030
I buy a magazine that
I leave at the counter.

342
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:29,571
That's how high.

343
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:29,841
I'm not like,

344
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:30,674
I want to get this magazine.

345
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,340
And then I walk away from it and I
remember like 30 minutes later before we

346
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:36,740
board and I go back and
it's sitting there and I go,

347
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,090
that's my magazine.

348
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,483
And Lady's like,

349
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:40,843
okay.

350
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,751
And I go,

351
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:42,860
I paid for it already.

352
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,843
And she was like,

353
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,870
okay,

354
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,380
like go ahead and take that
if you went out of my mind.

355
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,483
But then,

356
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,480
then we walk by,

357
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,670
we go and a guy,

358
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,120
a fucking pilot comes by,

359
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:53,740
you know,

360
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,111
they have like,

361
00:08:54,111 --> 00:08:54,400
they're,

362
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,570
they're always have that double
look luggage thing right there.

363
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,040
One bag on top of the other,

364
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,510
the pilot bag.

365
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,790
He fucking walks by us and he's like,

366
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:03,870
Hey Joey Diaz.

367
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,471
And I'm like,

368
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:05,670
are you serious right now?

369
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,630
And he's like,

370
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,350
it's my airport.

371
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,520
Everybody calls me this airport.

372
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,880
I'm like,

373
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,540
really?

374
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,380
He's my airport.

375
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,490
And then Oregon,

376
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,780
this was in Burbank,

377
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,453
Burbank airport.

378
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,510
We then get stopped in,

379
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,990
we'd land in Sacramento and
people stop them for pictures.

380
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,420
Then the baggage handler,

381
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,620
uh,

382
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,453
stops him,

383
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,850
asked him like a hundred weeks.

384
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,040
I hate these fucking questions guys.

385
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,330
Ask Way too many questions.

386
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,960
No.

387
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,793
Okay.

388
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,251
So we,

389
00:09:33,251 --> 00:09:34,060
we leave there.

390
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,211
Well,

391
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:35,100
he's super high.

392
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,180
Can't off just having
conversations with people.

393
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,800
Then a family stops him.

394
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,140
A lady with kids stops him for a picture.

395
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,920
They all take a picture
together like it was nonstop.

396
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,943
The best was that,

397
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,030
oh this is the best part.

398
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:51,180
So I take the quarter bite right and
I'm completely fucking out of my mind.

399
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,990
He eats an entire one.

400
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,580
We sit down on the plane
and he starts talking to me.

401
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:57,821
I'm like,

402
00:09:57,821 --> 00:09:58,660
shut up man.

403
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,590
Shut the fuck up.

404
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,290
I cannot listen to you right
now cause I'm like shaking.

405
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,124
Like I'm like,

406
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:03,710
I got,

407
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,410
he told him to shut up
cause you're laughing.

408
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,870
Yes,

409
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,250
yes.

410
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:06,461
I'm like,

411
00:10:06,461 --> 00:10:07,630
I can't hear you talk.

412
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,493
Shut up.

413
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,970
And he's like,

414
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,833
he's like,

415
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,810
he like looked around,

416
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,560
he was like anyways and
he opens up a second one,

417
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,160
eats the sec and to have the
thing I have a quarter bite of,

418
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,720
so he's on eight doses of why I'm on

419
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,453
and I'm like,

420
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,750
Jesus Christ.

421
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,590
So we go through this flight
and every time he looks at me,

422
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,701
like I said,

423
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:31,070
he goes,

424
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,903
oh,

425
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,570
I like to shop for the dog and story.

426
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,080
No,

427
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,290
he gives Dunkin a cookie and then he
calls him an hour and a half later.

428
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:39,650
It goes,

429
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,270
welcome to my world motherfucker.

430
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,123
Dude,

431
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,083
ow,

432
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,953
ow,

433
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:48,560
ow.

434
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,400
We land,

435
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,910
we land I and M as we're landing.

436
00:10:52,911 --> 00:10:53,391
And I was like,

437
00:10:53,391 --> 00:10:54,224
man,

438
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,700
I go dude,

439
00:10:55,701 --> 00:10:56,534
I was,

440
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,700
I was pretty fucked up man.

441
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,200
And he goes and I look at him,

442
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,490
cause all I'm thinking is like,

443
00:11:01,491 --> 00:11:05,240
I can't believe how much
more advanced you are.

444
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:05,630
The me,

445
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:05,871
you know,

446
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:06,704
it's like,

447
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,570
like I cannot believe what you mean.

448
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:09,021
Tolerance.

449
00:11:09,021 --> 00:11:09,300
Why?

450
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:09,710
It's like,

451
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,340
it's like I can't believe I ran
a mile and you just ran 40 miles.

452
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:14,390
Like that's crazy to me.

453
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,270
And we both finished at the
same time and then I go.

454
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:19,070
So I'm amazed that he's not affected.

455
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,091
I go,

456
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:21,820
I can't believe how much
that fucking we have to go.

457
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,810
I almost had three panic
attacks on that flight you got.

458
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:25,540
I was like,

459
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,110
yes.

460
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,400
It made me so happy

461
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,970
that he was also fucked up.

462
00:11:30,971 --> 00:11:31,804
And I was like,

463
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,720
Carrie still goes down right back in.

464
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:35,554
I go,

465
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,831
I go,

466
00:11:35,831 --> 00:11:36,970
I'm glad it's starting to wear off.

467
00:11:36,971 --> 00:11:37,241
He goes,

468
00:11:37,241 --> 00:11:37,950
not for me.

469
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,671
Fucked up,

470
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:39,504
right?

471
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,001
Yeah.

472
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:46,290
His idea of going deep is so
much deeper than your idea.

473
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,710
He's breaking world records
on a daily basis all the time.

474
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:52,890
He's at the bottom of the Marianas
trench with a shovel and he's like,

475
00:11:52,891 --> 00:11:54,190
there's be a deepest spot.

476
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,053
This is bullshit.

477
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,150
And the first thing he did
as we get off that was like,

478
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,290
let's smoke this joint.

479
00:11:59,291 --> 00:11:59,531
I was like,

480
00:11:59,531 --> 00:12:00,490
what are you talking about?

481
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:01,660
What are you talking about man?

482
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,900
We're not smoking a joint.

483
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:07,330
I can take a break and
he's a maniac breaks.

484
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,010
He's of no Greg Maniac.

485
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,240
Yeah.

486
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,430
Well he just goes through
the whole day like that.

487
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,181
And that's where,

488
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:13,391
you know,

489
00:12:13,391 --> 00:12:14,620
people would step in and say,

490
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,360
well that boy's got a problem.

491
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,230
Yeah.

492
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,340
I'll tell you what he got.

493
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:18,930
But he doesn't.

494
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:19,181
Yeah,

495
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:20,260
he gets for a comedian.

496
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:20,710
Yeah.

497
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,210
It might be the best way to live life.

498
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,230
Yeah.

499
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,970
Scared on a regular basis.

500
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,130
And in between laughing your Dick off,

501
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,090
scared,

502
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:28,990
laughing your dick off.

503
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:29,710
Scared,

504
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,730
laughing you dick off.

505
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,121
Yeah.

506
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:31,391
He,

507
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:31,600
um,

508
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:31,980
uh,

509
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,813
he is,

510
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,600
the funny thing is like,

511
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,460
even his regular cadence,

512
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:42,060
it's so is out of the norm for other
people that you see people react to them.

513
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,520
It's more fun to even watch people like
at the restaurant next to us react to

514
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:50,980
him than it is almost to watch him.

515
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,030
Like he's talking and I see them like,

516
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:53,351
they're like,

517
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:53,831
Jesus,

518
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:55,150
like this is like a fucking,

519
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,790
it's like you brought in a
pit bull to have lunch here.

520
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:58,211
You know what I mean?

521
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:02,440
They've never seen somebody so intense
and animate and saying these crazy

522
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:03,100
things.

523
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,130
It's like you watch them react to Joey.

524
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,701
Right,

525
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:07,031
right,

526
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:07,864
right.

527
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,411
Yeah.

528
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:08,711
Yeah.

529
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:09,371
I know what you mean,

530
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,060
man.

531
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,893
He's just,

532
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,700
it's just,

533
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,210
they don't come along that often.

534
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:13,781
No,

535
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:14,111
he's a,

536
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,980
it's a rare thing.

537
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:15,321
I said,

538
00:13:15,321 --> 00:13:15,590
they're there.

539
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,001
They're like,

540
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:16,211
well,

541
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:17,044
who's this guy?

542
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,471
Yeah.

543
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:17,771
You know,

544
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:17,951
like,

545
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,880
you know guys and you go,

546
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,121
oh,

547
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:19,511
I get it.

548
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:21,010
That guy's like a little bit of this guy.

549
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,280
A little bit of that guy's
combination of Joey's just like,

550
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,620
what is that?

551
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,453
Where'd that come from?

552
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,780
You want to kill somebody?

553
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:29,860
You invite him over for dinner?

554
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,723
What?

555
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,920
Oh,

556
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,390
is his logic,

557
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,640
how to get crimes committed correctly.

558
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,760
And then my favorite thing is
they'll say something and go,

559
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,950
you know what the fuck I'm saying
do I need to just walks away?

560
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,300
Yeah.

561
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,600
We'll end on a strong point.

562
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,011
You want to kill somebody,

563
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:46,180
you invite him over dinner.

564
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:46,880
Oh,

565
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,380
walks away.

566
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,250
Great sense of timing.

567
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:48,880
Yeah.

568
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,690
Amazing.

569
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,011
It's,

570
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:53,380
it's a standup timing that he uses
like in everyday life or your life.

571
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,850
It's never doing an act because his act
as his life and his life as his act.

572
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,010
Yeah.

573
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,761
The way he talks his,

574
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:01,450
his act.

575
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,230
Totally.

576
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,820
That's like the best
you could ever hope for.

577
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,480
The best you could ever hope
for is like a merging of you,

578
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:10,510
of your ability to be
you offstage and onstage.

579
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:10,871
Yeah.

580
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:11,260
I mean,

581
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,100
I mean look at like who everybody or
a lot of people that say it was like,

582
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:15,934
you know,

583
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,900
total master comedian
basically talks in his voice,

584
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:23,380
like Chapelle walks up and he's
like tells you about his day.

585
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:23,710
Yeah.

586
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,240
And that's kind of like the highest form,

587
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:25,421
right,

588
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:26,101
of being a comment.

589
00:14:26,101 --> 00:14:26,770
Cause you're like,

590
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,251
I'm just going to,

591
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:28,420
this isn't even a thing.

592
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,350
I'm just talking to you.

593
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,520
Yeah.

594
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,330
And like Diaz is like a version of
that where like he's just being Diaz.

595
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,260
We know who uh,

596
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:36,671
was.

597
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:37,210
Uh,

598
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:37,641
like I,

599
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:37,991
I talk,

600
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:39,490
I tell the story now on stage.

601
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,260
The guy who used to drive us,

602
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,720
oh my God to the airport.

603
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,220
It was our driver,

604
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,020
like a regular guy because we were,

605
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:48,760
we go to the airport so often we use this,

606
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,110
you know,

607
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,320
without like a cheaper car service,

608
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:53,330
it's easier than dealing with
like driving and parking.

609
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:53,870
Right.

610
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,870
And like he was,

611
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,030
you know,

612
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,200
it was like a cheap ride,

613
00:14:57,201 --> 00:15:02,201
basically older guy and I'm like all
white hair and was really professional.

614
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,910
And then like after like 10 rides,

615
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:05,780
one of those things where like,

616
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,260
you know,

617
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,110
when somebody like Mr Rogue
and Mr and you finally go,

618
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:10,020
you can call me Joe.

619
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,900
It was like that kind of
thing where I was like,

620
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:12,291
it's Tom,

621
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:12,741
he's like this,

622
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:13,350
Tom and I,

623
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:13,581
I'm like,

624
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:13,731
yeah.

625
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:14,001
He's like,

626
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:14,211
cool.

627
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:15,020
Hey Man,

628
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,711
let me ask you something.

629
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:15,861
Like,

630
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:16,611
everything changed.

631
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:17,444
As soon as I said,

632
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,090
you don't have to be professional with me.

633
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,361
And he goes,

634
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:21,194
uh,

635
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:21,831
he goes,

636
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:22,521
can I ask you something?

637
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:22,941
And I was like,

638
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:23,270
yeah.

639
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:23,690
And he goes,

640
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,523
do you smoke weed?

641
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,220
And I was like,

642
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,030
uh,

643
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,391
yeah,

644
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:26,601
I mean,

645
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:26,991
I guess.

646
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:27,520
Yeah.

647
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:27,981
And he's like,

648
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:28,940
do you wanna smoke some now?

649
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:29,391
I was like,

650
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:29,900
really,

651
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,733
like five in the morning.

652
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,533
And I was like,

653
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,170
I was like,

654
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:33,411
yeah.

655
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:34,070
All right.

656
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:34,910
And then you said,

657
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,151
yeah,

658
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:35,421
right?

659
00:15:35,421 --> 00:15:35,810
Yeah.

660
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,051
Okay.

661
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:36,471
Driver.

662
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:36,830
Yeah,

663
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,170
that's exactly what my head
comfortable with you in my life.

664
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,400
And then he goes,

665
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,320
he starts smoking and then he goes,

666
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:42,490
uh,

667
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,910
I can't drive unless I'm fucked up.

668
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,440
That's a quo.

669
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,500
[inaudible]

670
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,140
and then Judd Apatow,

671
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,740
I swear to God,

672
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,570
he's like Seventies.

673
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:03,320
And then he goes,

674
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,600
and then he's like this
morning like this particularly,

675
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:06,350
it is early.

676
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,280
He drives fast.

677
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:08,114
He's like one of these,

678
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,650
I've been driving 50 years now.

679
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:09,831
Like,

680
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:10,670
we've got to take this street.

681
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,651
And I was like,

682
00:16:12,651 --> 00:16:12,860
you know,

683
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,491
I was basically like,

684
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:14,540
keep it together man.

685
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,321
And he was like,

686
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:15,651
he was like,

687
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:16,411
I've been up since,

688
00:16:16,411 --> 00:16:16,650
you know,

689
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,200
three.

690
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,033
And then I'm like,

691
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,073
Shit.

692
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,960
I started asking him,

693
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:21,231
I'm like,

694
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:22,820

695
00:16:22,821 --> 00:16:23,030
He's like,

696
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,210

697
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,110

698
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,100
Like I've done it all.

699
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:25,971
And I was like,

700
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:26,241

701
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:26,901

703
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:27,621
He's like,

704
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:28,970

705
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,123

706
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,780
And he is flying through El Barrio

He was married to a Peruvian and then he
had like an El Salvadorian girlfriend.

711
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:51,861
He's like,

733
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,571
And I was like,

734
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:22,670

735
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,420

00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,080
oh man.

737
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,381
He's like,

738

what I like to do and when
I smoked crack is like,

don't say anything.

742
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,570
Did he say porn?

743
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,973
He watches porn.

744
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:34,620
No,

745
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,420
no.

746
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:35,900
I'm sorry.

747
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,381
He goes,

748
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:37,130
uh,

749
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:37,850
I like to,

750
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:42,430
I like to look through the people and
I look around at what the fuck's out.

751
00:17:42,431 --> 00:17:43,610
And I think I see all this shit.

752
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,200
I think about what's going to happen next.

753
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,420
I see people walking by and I
just kind of fucking freak out,

754
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:48,254
you know?

755
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,010
And

756
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,311
I was like,

757
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:51,300
this sounds terrible,

758
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:52,134
man.

759
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,311
He was like,

760
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:54,030
as part of the rush,

761
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,631
that's the rush.

762
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:55,840
You know what the law happen.

763
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,113

00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,580
come get you.

765
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:04,530
That's his rush to stop
you because everybody says,

766
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:07,500
everybody that I've ever talked to him
and smoked crack says they watch porn.

767
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,663
Oh,

768
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,940

fuck like animal like you would have.

769
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,281

771
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,880
Sorry.

772
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,160
Sorry,

773
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,390
I can't say his last name.

774
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,440
I know his last name.

775
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:20,843
Henry the eighth.

776
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,860
So the best is,

777
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:23,300

780
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:27,180
I go,

781
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,290
so do you still do that?

782
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,480
Shit goes,

783
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,810

784
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:31,011

786
00:18:31,101 --> 00:18:31,211
no,

787
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:31,381
no.

788
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:31,830
He goes,

789
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,663
well,

790
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,593
you know,

791
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,620
every once in a while,

792
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:38,010
but you know what they say if you
do something every once in a while,

793
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,450
it's not that bad for you.

794
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:39,990
And I go,

795
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,580
I think they mean that about like pizza,

796
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,003
chocolate.

797
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,133
And he's like,

798
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,203
swear to God.

799
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,730
Every once in a while we'll,

800
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,290
do you remember when the mayor of
Washington DC got caught smoking Marion?

801
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,021
Yeah.

802
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:58,140
With an FBI agent in the fucking
hotel room or an informant.

803
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,580
She was being a prostitute.

804
00:18:59,581 --> 00:18:59,941
Yeah,

805
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:00,151
yeah,

806
00:19:00,151 --> 00:19:00,670
yeah.

807
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,351
You remember that Shit.

808
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:03,950
He was smoking crack and
running the nation's capitol.

809
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,780
And then when they asked people about it,

810
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,630
the greatest thing was
after he got caught,

811
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,411
this guy,

812
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:11,670
I remember this guy on TV,

813
00:19:11,671 --> 00:19:11,971
they say,

814
00:19:11,971 --> 00:19:14,040
what do you think about the
mayor getting caught smoking?

815
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:14,670
Greg goes,

816
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,030
man,

817
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,290
everybody's a molo cracking,

818
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,560
but now and then every now he said,

819
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,260
everybody smoke a little
crack every now and then.

820
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,370
This guy was on TV.

821
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:23,641
He's like,

822
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:24,390
come on man,

823
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,200
stop playing.

824
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,781
You're being reduced.

825
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:26,580
Why you stopped playing?

826
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,300
Who doesn't?

827
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,140
Who doesn't vote crack?

828
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,450
Hey by smoked some great
mental now and then

829
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,880
that reminds me of the
first time I bought drugs.

830
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,590
The first time I ever bought drugs.

831
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,431
Tell me what you remember.

832
00:19:35,431 --> 00:19:37,000
You remember the first
time you were married?

833
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,580
He told me that you had a story.

834
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,170
I met the first time it about drugs.

835
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:45,171
I was in high school and I went to a
small high school so I was trying to be

836
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,380
like,

837
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,450
not make a thing to ask about it at first.

838
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:48,960
You know,

839
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,740
cause you don't want it to get
around and like be a cause.

840
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,130
So you were curious?

841
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,431
Yeah,

842
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:56,520
I wanted to try stuff but I didn't know
who to ask because if you ask like at a

843
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:57,390
small school you're like,

844
00:19:57,391 --> 00:19:58,620
I could blow up real fast.

845
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:58,910
Right.

846
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,090
That's how guys would traveling.

847
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,190
So my friend Steve had just transferred
from like the big high school,

848
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:07,410
like from a high school
with like 5,000 kids.

849
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,360
And so it was like a
weekend and I was like,

850
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:10,141
let's get a sack.

851
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:13,570
And I think we had just seen
menace to society and we were like,

852
00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:13,681
Yo,

853
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:14,101
what's up?

854
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:16,830
Like we were trying to tell
her it'd be like hardcore guys.

855
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,780
I'm like pulling the hat
to the side and be like,

856
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:19,261

857
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:20,340
And did you wear your hat to the side?

858
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:20,761
No,

859
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:21,560
but I think,

860
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:21,900
you know,

861
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,710
a lot of like throwing
swag and shit and like,

862
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:25,620
you know,

863
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:25,950
hey,

864
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,783
let's get a sack.

865
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,110
You getting your blackness on?

866
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,220
Definitely feeling it.

867
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,380

868
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:31,860

I got your back right.

870
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:33,840
And making shit up.

871
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,381
Little too white,

872
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:34,620
right?

873
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,070
Yeah.

874
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,780
And so comfortable with your existence.

875
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,380
Totally.

876
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,130
And then,

877
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:38,963
uh,

878
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:39,480
he's like,

879
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:39,961
I'll hook,

880
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:40,794
I know the guy.

881
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,380
So this is like a Saturday night.

882
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,360
This like long drink,

883
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:46,230
like old school,

884
00:20:46,231 --> 00:20:48,860
Seventies Cadillac pulls up and like,

885
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,271
he's like,

886
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:51,790
that's the dude and this
guy rolls the window down.

887
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,061
He's like,

888
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:52,241
Yo,

889
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:53,074
getting it back.

890
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,520
And I was like,

891
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:53,771
all right,

892
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:54,190
cool.

893
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,470
We get in the back if the thinking
like that's where it goes down.

894
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,550
And,

895
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,383
uh,

896
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,871
Steve's like,

897
00:20:58,871 --> 00:20:58,961
Yo,

898
00:20:58,961 --> 00:20:59,794
this is white Pete.

899
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,431
And I was like,

900
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:01,690
what's up Wipe Pete?

901
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,650
Like,

902
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:06,820
and then he was called White Pete cause
they needed to give him a distinction

903
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,030
for his name because he was the only
white guy that ran with his crew.

904
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:10,720
Right.

905
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,680
And he was like,

906
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,900
we didn't have driver's licenses.

907
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,700
So he was like,

908
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:19,150
exactly what we at that moment where
we want it to be in a couple of years.

909
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:20,920
Like he had like the whole unit,

910
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:23,320
like the oversized white tea and like,

911
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:23,770
you know,

912
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,640
gold chain.

913
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,271
Yeah.

914
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:26,140
And fucking like fate.

915
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:26,561
And he was like,

916
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:26,921
what's up?

917
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:27,491
I'm white people.

918
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:29,020
He talked like snoop Dogg almost.

919
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:29,920
Oh right.

920
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,720
And so we were like,

921
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,350
all right.

922
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,871
And I thought,

923
00:21:31,871 --> 00:21:32,201
he's like,

924
00:21:32,201 --> 00:21:33,340
so we're going to go get it now.

925
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:33,671
I was like,

926
00:21:33,671 --> 00:21:34,480
go get what?

927
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,830
Like I thought we were
just doing this in the car,

928
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,450
wouldn't go get that sac man.

929
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:37,990
I'm like,

930
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:38,321
oh,

931
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:39,154
okay.

932
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,881
So we started driving,

933
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,950
we go 30 minutes in a car,

934
00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:43,330
we go to the next town over,

935
00:21:43,331 --> 00:21:44,380
which is Fort Pierce,

936
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,440
which is definitely a shittier place.

937
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,221
Right.

938
00:21:48,221 --> 00:21:52,960
So we're driving through Fort Pierce and
we go from a main street to like single

939
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:53,621
lane highways.

940
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:53,801
You know,

941
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:54,640
in Florida there's like,

942
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,220
Oh yeah,

943
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:55,811
we're on a busy,

944
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:58,330
then we go to a single lane that
has like canals on each side.

945
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,050
Ooh.

946
00:21:59,050 --> 00:21:59,380
Yeah.

947
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,310
And we're driving and then we go from
that to a dirt road and then the dirt road

948
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,300
off of that dirt road.

949
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,400
Like we're driving down with like,

950
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:07,900
this is some forensic files,

951
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:08,260
Shit.

952
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,310
Like we're going to end up on,

953
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,330
there's a lot of woods.

954
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:10,930
Yeah.

955
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:11,763
A lot of brush,

956
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,190
uh,

957
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:12,791
groves,

958
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:13,450
that kind of shit.

959
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:13,871
And I was like,

960
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:14,704
fuck man.

961
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,521
And at this point,

962
00:22:15,521 --> 00:22:19,210
like I'm thinking about like
menace to society and I'm like,

963
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,410
I want to be in that right now.

964
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,250
But I'm feeling like,

965
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:21,700
ah,

966
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,540
feeling really white,

967
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,390
my like really scared and so,

968
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:26,570
and now it's night and it,

969
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,100
you know,

970
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,461
it's like,

971
00:22:27,461 --> 00:22:29,320
cause he came over in the evening already,

972
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:33,070
so now it's pitch black outside and
we're on a dirt road off of a dirt road.

973
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:34,570
Like you can scream,

974
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,040
there's nobody gonna hear Shit.

975
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,310
And on the dirt road up gravel path.

976
00:22:39,311 --> 00:22:44,311
I see a light and the light is from a
trailer because we pull up to the trailer

977
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,570
and we get out and it's me,

978
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,680
Steve and white Pete.

979
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,000
And we knock on the door,

980
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:53,350
that trailer and this dude opens the door
and he has his black guy that has like

981
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:54,940
six dreadlocks,

982
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:55,330
like you know,

983
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,510
each dreadlock is like a size of
like a king size snickers bar.

984
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,130
And he's got six snicker bars
coming out of his hair and why?

985
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:02,441
He's like,

986
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:03,280
what's up Pat Pat?

987
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:03,611
And he's like,

988
00:23:03,611 --> 00:23:04,480
what's up White Pete?

989
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,770
And they give each other a hug.

990
00:23:05,771 --> 00:23:06,250
And I was like,

991
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:06,920
Oh fuck.

992
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,550
Now this really is like
totally menace to society shit.

993
00:23:09,551 --> 00:23:10,384
Right?

994
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,520
But I'm told,

995
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,840
so trying to be cool about it,

996
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,351
like,

997
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,580
so trying to be cool about it.

998
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,360
And then,

999
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:16,930
uh,

1000
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,910
he's like these white boys
looking for a sack and he's like,

1001
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:19,061
yeah,

1002
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:19,894
we could do that.

1003
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,431
So we go on.

1004
00:23:20,431 --> 00:23:20,831
So the mind,

1005
00:23:20,831 --> 00:23:24,850
you were looking for $20 and we drove.

1006
00:23:24,851 --> 00:23:25,684
And how long has it taken?

1007
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,100
This is from his point.

1008
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,740
It's like we're already 30
miles southwest of the city.

1009
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,161
We started,

1010
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:30,994
would you just say like,

1011
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,560
nevermind after 10 miles

1012
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,340
white peaches sell to you,

1013
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:38,350
why does he have to take you
on the trip to the God's house?

1014
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:38,680
I would,

1015
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,910
these are all questions I have,

1016
00:23:39,911 --> 00:23:41,110
but don't have the balls to ask.

1017
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:41,710
Like I,

1018
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,491
I'm in my mind,

1019
00:23:42,491 --> 00:23:42,850
I'm like,

1020
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:43,210
ah,

1021
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,110
like I'm 14,

1022
00:23:44,111 --> 00:23:46,190
15 and I'm not saying
it shift to this dude.

1023
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:46,760
Right.

1024
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,430
I'm cool.

1025
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,160
What's up?

1026
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,993
Let's get a sack.

1027
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:49,470
Right.

1028
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,303
We'll try me.

1029
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,740
So we go into his trailer and he's like,

1030
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:55,400
all right,

1031
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,490
we're going to get to do that sec.

1032
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,793
Uh,

1033
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,240
we back in 10 minutes.

1034
00:23:59,390 --> 00:23:59,721
I was like,

1035
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:01,070
who would be back in 10 minutes?

1036
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:01,461
He's like,

1037
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:04,430
we will be you stay
here and watch my place.

1038
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:04,971
And I was like,

1039
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:05,804
what?

1040
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,141
Like,

1041
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:07,760
what the fuck are you talking about?

1042
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,110
Is what I'm thinking?

1043
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,161
But then I just go like,

1044
00:24:10,161 --> 00:24:10,520
yeah,

1045
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,210
cool.

1046
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:11,860
Totally.

1047
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,890
You're in his trailer.

1048
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,641
And he's like,

1049
00:24:13,641 --> 00:24:14,474
watch it for me.

1050
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,580
And I'm like,

1051
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,580
oh no.

1052
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,140
Like I'm feeling like that,

1053
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:19,580
like real fear.

1054
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,600
But I go,

1055
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,200
yeah,

1056
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,033
no problem man.

1057
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,890
Like I watched people's
houses all the time,

1058
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,980
like it totally fucking terrified.

1059
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,820
And then he goes like the,

1060
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:30,890
you walk in the trailer,

1061
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,810
you're in the living room because
that's the way to train leaders,

1062
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:32,991
right?

1063
00:24:32,991 --> 00:24:35,030
You walk into it as a
bedroom to the right.

1064
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,640
He's like waiting here on the bad.

1065
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:37,910
He's like,

1066
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,700
it was a 45 and a 12 gauge and he goes,

1067
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:41,960
anybody comes in my,

1068
00:24:41,961 --> 00:24:42,794
in my house,

1069
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,780
you shoot him.

1070
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,450
And I was like,

1071
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,170
right.

1072
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,310
And then he's like a Sephora,

1073
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:46,850
my Mama,

1074
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:47,720
my mama comes home,

1075
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,440
don't shoot her.

1076
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,010
And I was like,

1077
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,600
got it and accept.

1078
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,580
I kept trying to be cool
about it and I was like,

1079
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,241
yeah,

1080
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,074
like that's what's up.

1081
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:54,471
I know,

1082
00:24:54,471 --> 00:24:55,340
I know what you're saying man.

1083
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,533
Look at that sac.

1084
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,350
Totally like trying to be like,

1085
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:00,801
he was like,

1086
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:01,460
all right.

1087
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,300
They walk out,

1088
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:07,301
they leave me in his trailer with two
guns and a fucking message to not to shoot

1089
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:11,930
everybody but his mother and I just sit
there and I watch the MTV video music

1090
00:25:11,931 --> 00:25:13,670
awards and the whole time,

1091
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:14,481
like every show that comes,

1092
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:19,481
I just am rocking and I'm actually hoping
that it's an intruder versus his mom

1093
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,770
because I feel like if it's his mom,

1094
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,510
she might accidentally shoot her.

1095
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,180
How is she going to
react to my explanation?

1096
00:25:26,181 --> 00:25:28,670
Like pep had just told me to wait here.

1097
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,200
Well he's getting some weed for me,

1098
00:25:30,201 --> 00:25:30,551
but I'm,

1099
00:25:30,551 --> 00:25:31,670
that's what I'm supposed
to shoot everybody,

1100
00:25:31,671 --> 00:25:32,504
but you,

1101
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,613
are you cool with that?

1102
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:35,480
And she's like,

1103
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:35,851
oh yeah,

1104
00:25:35,851 --> 00:25:36,201
that happens.

1105
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:36,740
All thought like,

1106
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,790
how are you going to react to this?

1107
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,590
So I fuck,

1108
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:39,801
I mean,

1109
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:41,240
I'm having a panic attack.

1110
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,080
We finally,

1111
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,913
they come back,

1112
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,880
I get back in with a white Pete,

1113
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,720
he drives us back and I'm sitting there,

1114
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,371
I'm like,

1115
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:50,420
what the fuck dude,

1116
00:25:50,421 --> 00:25:51,560
that was the worst shit ever.

1117
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,880
Like I'm fucking terrified.

1118
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:53,241
And he's like,

1119
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:53,490
yeah,

1120
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,141
him and Pat,

1121
00:25:54,141 --> 00:25:54,710
Pat,

1122
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,060
Steven,

1123
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,270
pat became like best friends.

1124
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,190
So they became like super close.

1125
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,110
Like that was like his guy he
would go to and I'd be like,

1126
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:00,710
no dude,

1127
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,750
I don't want to hang
out with pat pat at all.

1128
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,930
And like six months later
when Steve got his license,

1129
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,220
we went and he was like,

1130
00:26:07,221 --> 00:26:08,090
you want to get some weed today?

1131
00:26:08,091 --> 00:26:08,421
I was like,

1132
00:26:08,421 --> 00:26:08,750
yeah,

1133
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:08,961
yeah,

1134
00:26:08,961 --> 00:26:09,201
yeah.

1135
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:10,370
So where we go,

1136
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,330
we go to fort peers,

1137
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,980
pull it to pat Pat's and I'm like,

1138
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:13,880
God dammit Mike.

1139
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,500
She remembered how to get there.

1140
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:15,921
He did.

1141
00:26:15,921 --> 00:26:17,450
Steve had started going
there all the time.

1142
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,530
Oh my God.

1143
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,860
We pulled up to his trailer this time
he gets out now this time I'm like,

1144
00:26:21,861 --> 00:26:21,981
well,

1145
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:22,591
they're friends,

1146
00:26:22,591 --> 00:26:24,920
so this is probably gonna
be a much quicker thing.

1147
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,521
He comes out,

1148
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:26,780
he jumps in the back and he's like,

1149
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:27,201
all right,

1150
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:27,681
let's roll.

1151
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:28,160
And I was like,

1152
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,640
ah,

1153
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,210
no,

1154
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,110
like fuck.

1155
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,540
And look for a sack again.

1156
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:33,980
Like I thought you just have this.

1157
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,310
So this time we went to this,

1158
00:26:37,311 --> 00:26:40,010
but these are the things [inaudible]
scared the shit out of me the first time.

1159
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:44,520
But that second time he saved our life
actually because we went from his trailer

1160
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:46,380
the second time where
he jumped in the back,

1161
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,640
went to Avenue d,

1162
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,820
which is the fucking shitty
street in Fort Pierce.

1163
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:53,220
Like if you're going to like every city,

1164
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:54,054
you know you have like,

1165
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,970
I dunno whatever city you're
in there like that's ever seen.

1166
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,840
Have you been to the street where you
see open drug dealing where there's not

1167
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:02,150
even some type of facades?

1168
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,950
Angeles had been down a
street where there's like,

1169
00:27:04,951 --> 00:27:06,180
there's no pretense about it.

1170
00:27:06,181 --> 00:27:07,830
There's just like Los Angeles,

1171
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,770
which part of filming?

1172
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,411
Fear factor.

1173
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:13,950
We were actually filming the playboy
playmate addition of fear factor downtown

1174
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:14,784
area and yeah,

1175
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,230
we were watching people sell drugs,

1176
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:17,550
smoke crack right there.

1177
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,210
We were in a crane and we're like,

1178
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:19,681
oh look,

1179
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:20,520
they're smoking crack.

1180
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,270
And the girls like,

1181
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:21,661
oh my God,

1182
00:27:21,661 --> 00:27:23,910
they are smoking crack and
like this is ridiculous.

1183
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,350
No one's protecting us.

1184
00:27:25,351 --> 00:27:26,250
We're up here on a crane.

1185
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:29,420
That was exactly like this
where we pulled up in,

1186
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,450
in Steve's car and the windows come
down and we just get surrounded.

1187
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,150
Like the car got surrounded by six guys
and they reached in their jackets and

1188
00:27:39,151 --> 00:27:41,020
they go at this one guy who is,

1189
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,560
you all look familiar
and this other guy goes,

1190
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:43,711
yeah,

1191
00:27:43,711 --> 00:27:44,760
y'all are real familiar.

1192
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,920
Y'All ever been here
before and that when you,

1193
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,860
when somebody says that you looked
familiar I've with any before,

1194
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,053
how would you answer that?

1195
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,380
I just say uh,

1196
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:52,750
nope.

1197
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,470
Nope.

1198
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,830
Right at exactly at that moment I got no,

1199
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,640
and Steve at the exact same it goes yup,

1200
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,680

1201
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:01,861

1202
00:28:01,861 --> 00:28:02,694
I told you man,

1203
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,170
y'all look like the white boys.

1204
00:28:04,171 --> 00:28:07,320
They've been snatching bags
around here that was like,

1205
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:07,830
ah,

1206
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,610
fuck.

1207
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:12,120
Like you look like the white boys
that haven't taken bags from guys.

1208
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,141
I'm like,

1209
00:28:13,141 --> 00:28:13,950

1210
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,820
that's not us.

1211
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,211
And Steve's like,

1212
00:28:15,211 --> 00:28:16,050
but we have been here before.

1213
00:28:16,051 --> 00:28:16,261
I'm like,

1214
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,600
will you shut the fuck up?

1215
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,300
Hackpad is in the back of like,

1216
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:20,780
hold on.

1217
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,730
He gets out and like walks up,

1218
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,790
talks to all of them,

1219
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:24,031
like,

1220
00:28:24,031 --> 00:28:24,690
uh,

1221
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,080
you know,

1222
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,400
like he's the ambassador,

1223
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:26,730
right?

1224
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,000
And like,

1225
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,870
I don't know what the fuck you like.

1226
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,970
I own these guys there
with me like fucking,

1227
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,380
and they totally let us go,

1228
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:32,671
but without,

1229
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:33,690
without him we would have been fucked.

1230
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,621
What's that noise?

1231
00:28:34,621 --> 00:28:35,530
What is that noise?

1232
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,450
That's not mine.

1233
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,283
It's my

1234
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:41,610
pat pat.

1235
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:41,821
Pat,

1236
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:42,270
pat.

1237
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:42,541
Pat.

1238
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:43,081
Pat is still,

1239
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:44,100
I don't know what happened to Pat,

1240
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:46,150
pat and white Pete who knows things?

1241
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,610
Probably not good things,

1242
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:48,000
man.

1243
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,720
You should Facebook.

1244
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,553

1245
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,440

1246
00:28:51,441 --> 00:28:51,690

1247
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,010
Pat.

1248
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,640
That would be the next person that makes
up a fake Twitter accounts of real fee.

1249
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:56,221
That was,

1250
00:28:56,221 --> 00:28:57,150
I had real fear.

1251
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:57,880
Oh yeah.

1252
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,440
You're like,

1253
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,460

1254
00:28:59,490 --> 00:28:59,621
Oh.

1255
00:28:59,621 --> 00:29:01,200
Like when you feel your
stomach dropping your like,

1256
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,850

1257
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:03,923
Oh my God.

1258
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,190
Yeah.
