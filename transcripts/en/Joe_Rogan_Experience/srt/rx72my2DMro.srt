1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,240
This episode of the podcast is the last
remaining podcasts from the Joe Rogan

2
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:06,751
questions.

3
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:08,640
Everything side five show,

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,910
we'll we do another episode of that show.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,010
I have no idea.

6
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:15,330
It's up for debate.

7
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:17,010
It's in talks.

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,990
We've tried to figure out another way
to do it that doesn't involve driving to

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,910
weird places are flying in to meet a
bunch of shitheads who are aligned to us

10
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:31,911
about whether or not they've been abducted
by aliens or seen big foot or that

11
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:36,480
was the primary problem that we
had with that television show.

12
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,670
The big problem that I had with it was
I didn't want to do a show where we were

13
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:44,130
just running around debunking things.

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,160
I wanted to do a show where we were
talking to people that that brought up

15
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:54,030
questions that I thought was actually,

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,340
that I thought were actually fascinating,

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,700
that people that really had information
that stimulated your curiosity and I

18
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:04,050
really didn't find that too much.

19
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:04,520
We,

20
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,780
we've found that with the real subjects.

21
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:09,000
We found that with the
subjects like transhumanism,

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,170
when we talk to these people that
really were interested in pushing the

23
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:14,550
boundaries of technology,

24
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,993
um,

25
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,370
with those folks,

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,870
we really did have a
interesting conversations.

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,900
We really did cover subjects that
I thought were worthy of your time,

28
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:30,240
of your energy,

29
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:32,910
of your viewing and listening pleasure.

30
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:33,840
Um,

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,220
but far too often what
we dealt with was a,

32
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:42,510
a bunch of lost people that
were completely fixated on
ideas that were probably

33
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:46,380
nonsense and I didn't
want to do that anymore,

34
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,490
but I did enjoy doing know was
doing the podcast aspect of it.

35
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,650
I really did enjoy talking to Dunkin.

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,040
I really did enjoy hanging out with him
and having a good time just goofing on

37
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,600
life,

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,120
goofing on the situations
that we found ourselves in.

39
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:08,100
And one of the situations was when we
went to this place called skin Walker

40
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:10,320
ranch and skin Walker ranch.

41
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,950
Is this a place that's
out in the middle of Utah?

42
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,450
And uh,

43
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,220
we flew out there and met with
this questionable individual who,

44
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,063
uh,

45
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,600
I think it's safe to say is
at least mostly full of shit.

46
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,970
But the,

47
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,171
the,

48
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:31,780
the trip was still fun and
talking about it was fun and,

49
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,120
and just talking about it
was what I found to be the,

50
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,983
just the,

51
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,500
not just the most fun part
of doing the show for me,

52
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:45,501
but the most entertaining part of the
show was exploring these ideas with an

53
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:47,160
intelligent guy like Dunkin.

54
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,151
Um,

55
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:49,920
so whether or not the show moves on,

56
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,770
I will definitely continue to
do things like that with Dunkin.

57
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,180
So this is the last podcast and this
episode is brought to you by audible.

uh,

61
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,480
and you haven't listened to books on tape,

62
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,730
you are doing yourself a disservice.

63
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,360
It's a fantastic way to
continue a book as well.

64

If you have the,

65
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,040
Amazon has this thing called the kindle
fire HD and they have an app called

66
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:24,280
whisper sync and would whisper sync does,

67
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,370
it allows you to read a book,

68
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,850
you read a book and you get to a certain
part of the book and you shut it off

69
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:35,350
and it syncs up with the audio recording
of that book that you can listen to in

your car or on your mobile phone or what

whatever you're doing.

73
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,900
It allows you to go back and forth between
reading the book and having someone

74
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:51,040
read the book to you.

75
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,030

Yeah.

111
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,093
Are we rolling?

112
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,660
We good?

113
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,493
Yup.

114
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:22,640
Yeah,

115
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,540
I'll smoke is in here.

116
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,493
All right.

117
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,593
Looking at this,

118
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,230
this is the fog of confusion.

119
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,050
That's what's in the air dock
and the fog of confusion.

120
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:33,560
Yeah.

121
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,880
The smoke of mystery.

122
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,753
Mm.

123
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,320
Um,

124
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,920
so we went to Skin Walker branch and uh,

125
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,570
we found a lot of crazy.

126
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:42,560
Yes.

127
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,490
Find a lot of crazy.

128
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:44,030
Yes.

129
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:44,541
It was a,

130
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:45,440
an interesting place.

131
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,340
I'll tell you what,

132
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,240
Mike Miller,

133
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:47,460
the,

134
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,280
the gentleman that we talked to that,

135
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:49,670
uh,

136
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,550
lived with his cool dog
and had seen the orbs.

137
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,240
Yes.

138
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,670
That guy I enjoy talking to.

139
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,530
He seemed like a real to earth guy
that had no reason to lie to us.

140
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,670
He didn't seem like he had
any agenda and his story,

141
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
although sounds completely crazy while
he was saying it did not seem in any way

142
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:12,110
like he was being deceptive.

143
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,050
It seemed like he was
telling us a real account.

144
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,290
It's,

145
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:15,921
I know he was like,

146
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:16,880
I know it sounds crazy,

147
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,420
but it's what I saw and I believe him.

148
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:20,661
I mean,

149
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:23,240
I believe that he had this experience,

150
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,440
what it was,

151
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,090
who,

152
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:26,923
you know,

153
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,130
you would have to be there,

154
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:28,821
you'd have to see it.

155
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:29,571
And even then,

156
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:30,830
if you saw what he saw,

157
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,120
the way he explained it,

158
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:33,110
you wouldn't really know.

159
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:38,380
And I think that's a real problem with
any completely unique experience if you

160
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:40,131
had it.

161
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:41,240
And no one else had it.

162
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,040
What kind of a burden?

163
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:43,761
You know,

164
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:44,750
walking around,

165
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:49,751
like you've seen these rainbow colored
orbs that are the size of softballs and

166
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:53,870
they're flying around your house and
going through walls and your dog's looking

167
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,480
at them and you're shining lights on
them and they're avoiding the lights and

168
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:57,314
flying around.

169
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,790
What do you do?

170
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,331
It's over.

171
00:06:59,331 --> 00:06:59,960
It's gone.

172
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,590
They leave.

173
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,000
You're back to just sit at home.

174
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,290
The TV still on,

175
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,500
your dog's still there and
you and all of a sudden,

176
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:09,980
you know you're forced with this decision,

177
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:11,210
like what you're faced with this decision.

178
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:11,541
What do you do?

179
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,180
You'd tell your friends about
this and he keep that to yourself.

180
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,570
What would you do if you saw a bunch
of crazy orbs flying or in your car and

181
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:24,500
then disappearing off into space and
then virtue and you know other than your

182
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:27,740
own strange memory of what just happened?

183
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,660
Life is exactly the same.

184
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,560
What do you do?

185
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,430
Do you tell people?

186
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:31,791
Yeah.

187
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,460
You tell people you've got a
responsibility to tell people.

188
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:36,650
You've got to be brave
enough to tell people,

189
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:38,300
because if you don't tell people,

190
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:40,130
then you're discrediting,

191
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:40,671
ah,

192
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:41,810
your species.

193
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,460
If there's some kind of brand new thing
that's happening that no one's observed

194
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:47,750
before and you see it,

195
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,140
you've got to have the guts to
get out there and tell people.

196
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:51,700
Sure.

197
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,790
They're just going to look at you like,

198
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,031
oh,

199
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:58,031
this is the typical dusty see meant Lang
desert recluse with a filthy dog who's

200
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:01,880
been huffing paint and
hallucinating warps.

201
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,590
That's all anyone's going to think.

202
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,730
That's the problem.

203
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:07,880
But I think that you must help
people because if you don't,

204
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,190
then no one's going to investigate it.

205
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,780
And if no one investigates it,

206
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:16,781
then these things will remain in the
land of the crazy instead of coming into

207
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:17,361
the light.

208
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:18,470
And if they come into the light,

209
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,890
think of what that would
do to all of society.

210
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:27,070
If we can prove that there's
hyper dimensional orbs
that traverse wormholes to

211
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:31,190
communicate with dusty old cowboys
in the middle of Mormon country.

212
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,383
Wow.

213
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,500
What a great way of putting it.

214
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,810
Yeah.

215
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:38,120
And,

216
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,010
and if they really are some unique thing
that we are experiencing for the first

217
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:43,251
time,

218
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:46,850
but we'll continue to show
itself and eventually become,

219
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,391
you know,

220
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:50,300
factual eventually be a part of,

221
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,370
I dunno what we consider reality,

222
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,120
you know,

223
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,260
you would be so pissed.

224
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:54,500
You're like,

225
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,680
I saw that too and I

226
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,780
didn't have the balls to speak out.

227
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,351
That's right.

228
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:02,370
And what if Marconi never spoke out
when he started discovering radio waves?

229
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,750
What if Darwin never spoke out when
he recognized that there was a process

230
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:08,550
called evolution that was
happening in the world?

231
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,730
What if Edison never
spoke out when he was,

232
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:12,420
uh,

233
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:12,721
uh,

234
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:15,000
stealing Tesla's ideas?

235
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,010
Yeah.

236
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:17,671
You know,

237
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:20,190
and it's really interesting because when
you stop and think about what you're

238
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:20,821
talking about,

239
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:21,930
this flying thing,

240
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,033
you know,

241
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,010
why is that any stranger than fish?

242
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:30,420
Why is it any stranger than some thing
that breeze water and does whatever it

243
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:33,000
wants in this three dimensional
world under the ocean,

244
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,300
right.

245
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,160
Why isn't any weirder than birds?

246
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:35,880
Yeah.

247
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,840
Why is that any weirder than,

248
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:39,390
I saw an eagle the other
day when I was in Seattle.

249
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,160
So on the eagle flying
knife faced death machine.

250
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,300
Yeah.

251
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,850
That was a dinosaur that survived.

252
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,960
It survived and figured out how to
fly and steel fish from the water.

253
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:52,321
Yeah.

254
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:53,310
If someone came out to me and said,

255
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:54,070
listen,

256
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,340
uh,

257
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,560
and I'd never seen an eagle,

258
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:55,981
and they're like,

259
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:57,210
which do you think Israel,

260
00:09:57,211 --> 00:10:02,211
a floating orb that is alive and
follows you or a thing that evolved from

261
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:08,061
lizards that has a knife on its face
and flies through the sky killing fish.

262
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,231
Yeah.

263
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:11,064
It has like,

264
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,170
like like bone cutters.

265
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,370
Yes.

266
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,840
It's even sicker than a knife.

267
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:16,830
It's a pair of scissors.

268
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,620
It's a flying pair of scissors.

269
00:10:18,621 --> 00:10:23,621
A giant scissors faced Munster
from 65 million years ago.

270
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:24,361
Yeah.

271
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:26,340
That carries away your cat,

272
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:31,341
your Chihuahua and survived a giant
five mile wide chunk of stone and metal.

273
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:36,210
It's slammed into the earth and killed
just about everything except these

274
00:10:36,211 --> 00:10:37,530
country flying lizards.

275
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:38,040
Yes,

276
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,940
exactly.

277
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,880
And also look,

278
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,250
go down under the ocean,

279
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,840
go down into the deep,

280
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:47,580
deep parts of the ocean where you see
those creepy glowing Goblin things that

281
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:48,510
just live down there.

282
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,470
Absolutely.

283
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,870
There's things that are live.

284
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,200
There's self luminescent or we'll
bio luminescent like they glow.

285
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:56,910
They make light underneath the water.

286
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,110
How crazy is that?

287
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,700
Why is that any crazier than,

288
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,440
why is a flying orb crazy than that?

289
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:02,131
It's really not.

290
00:11:02,131 --> 00:11:04,080
Especially when you
consider what that orb did.

291
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:07,290
It's not like that orb stole his cat and
flew away within eight it on top of a

292
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,440
rock like an eagle would write.

293
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,340
An Eagle would steal your cat,

294
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:11,701
man.

295
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:12,540
No problem.

296
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,650
Eagle has no problem.

297
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,720
You leave a baby alone with an ego.

298
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:16,710
Watch what happens.

299
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,460
Sure.

300
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,630
It'll be crazy.

301
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:18,991
Yeah,

302
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:19,950
it's crazy man.

303
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:20,061
And,

304
00:11:20,061 --> 00:11:21,480
and but here's the difference.

305
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,580
Or if it's just fly around
the baby and take off,

306
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:24,991
nobody gets hurt.

307
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:25,441
We don't know.

308
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:27,630
Maybe the orbs plant seeds in the baby.

309
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,620
The thought of the baby change the way
the mind works and the ties the baby.

310
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:33,270
Maybe the orbs drive the baby.

311
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:33,930
Insane.

312
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,441
But we,

313
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:34,830
the,

314
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:39,180
the difference of course is that
there's a million pictures of eagles.

315
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,580
There's very few pictures of orbs.

316
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,680
There's a million pictures of
undersea death goblins that glow.

317
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,530
No pictures of Ufo.

318
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,430
So there's photos of orbs.

319
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,830
There's photos that people put
online that they claim to be orbs.

320
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,300
The problem is they're very
much like our guide in,

321
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,163
in Utah,

322
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,320
the the,

323
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:00,791
you know,

324
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,624
I don't know me,

325
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,630
maybe everything he said was
a hundred percent factual,

326
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,810
but it was so crazy to hear someone
who says they've seen big foot,

327
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,030
they've seen orbs and bulletproof Wolfe's.

328
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,950
They've seen all these things themselves
and they're telling you it's just a

329
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:16,391
spot.

330
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:17,224
This is the squeezebox.

331
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,500
Maybe he's telling the truth
but it's so fantastical.

332
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:24,640
And that is the sort of the same thing
that comes along with all of these,

333
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,410
all of these tales,

334
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,830
whether it's orbs or wolves or,

335
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:32,860
or any of the crazy things that we
were told that these people saw.

336
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,020
If they are real,

337
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,150
you're dealing with some crazy,

338
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:41,470
unique experience that really I commend
you for coming out and talking about it.

339
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:42,910
Cause I might keep my mouth shut.

340
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,980
I probably wouldn't,

341
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:45,610
I'm pretty stupid.

342
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,510
I would definitely talk about it.

343
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:47,440
If I saw something cool,

344
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,810
I would try I or am I talking about it?

345
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:49,644
I would talk about it,

346
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,550
but some people didn't want to talk to us.

347
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,820
And I could understand that first couple
that we meant that we were supposed to

348
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:57,640
talk and then the day of shooting
they got cold feet and they were like,

349
00:12:57,641 --> 00:12:58,061
you know what?

350
00:12:58,061 --> 00:12:59,770
We don't even want to talk about this.

351
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,010
It's like the last thing I want to do
is be that person on TV talking about

352
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:03,910
something duddy and they're like,

353
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,101
no,

354
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:04,211
no,

355
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:04,331
no,

356
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:04,520
no,

357
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:04,661
no,

358
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:04,751
no,

359
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:04,930
no.

360
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,400
We're not not doing it.

361
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,020
Like they just were done with it.

362
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,891
They thought about it,

363
00:13:08,891 --> 00:13:10,240
probably kept him up all night,

364
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,500
wisely cell.

365
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,610
But uh,

366
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,260
Mike didn't give a fuck.

367
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,243
You know what man?

368
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,001
Yeah.

369
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:16,870
He didn't give a fuck.

370
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,000
It didn't bother him at all.

371
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,200
And he told it to us,

372
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:21,160
just matter of fact,

373
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:23,710
and I was with them every step of the way.

374
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,510
I believe that guy was
telling us at true encounter.

375
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,000
Oh,

376
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,980
I don't know what it was.

377
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:30,551
I don't know what made me,

378
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:30,941
who knows?

379
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:35,380
He might have had like a misfiring of
like several key elements of his brain.

380
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:35,650
Sure.

381
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,020
And they might start producing
hallucinations in front of them.

382
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,620
Who knows how much whiskey he drank
right before he saw these orbs.

383
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,070
Yeah.

384
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:42,701
Who knows?

385
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:44,290
Who knows what cold medicines.

386
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,580
He mixed up a lot.

387
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,533
Who knows?

388
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,150
But the bottom line is this guy,

389
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,620
when he was telling us about this,

390
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,800
I believed them and if you and
I had just gotten to see it,

391
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:54,370
man,

392
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,520
what a world changing event that would be,

393
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:02,670
but that seems to be a part of the
narrative of all this really crazy

394
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:04,150
fantastical stuff.

395
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,600
It's like if you could
be there and see it,

396
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,820
boy would just change the world.

397
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:10,960
But when you go look in,

398
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,890
nobody finds shit ever,

399
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,430
ever,

400
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,210
ever.

401
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,460
It doesn't matter if you're
looking for big foot,

402
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,800
if you're looking for Ufo woes,

403
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:23,140
if you're trying to find
the loch ness monster,

404
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,260
you never fine shit.

405
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,740
People finance these giant missions.

406
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,310
They take these
[inaudible] radar machines,

407
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:38,490
troll the lock in Scotland every couple
of years they spend so much money

408
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,700
looking for something that's
probably never been there.

409
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,420
But that's,

410
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,410
that's what we do.

411
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,540
That's what human beings do is we try
to expand our understanding of the

412
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,010
universe and part of that means

413
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,810
investigating claims of bizarre
creatures and aliens and Ufos.

414
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,610
We have to investigate it,

415
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,760
but the difference between science and
these people is science is comfortable

416
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,530
with what they call a null hypothesis.

417
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,820
They're comfortable coming back with
no results and saying it's not there.

418
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,490
The thing that these people
don't seem capable of,

419
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:16,250
or at least the guy who had seen the
bulletproof wolf and big foot and

420
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:20,240
everything is he saw everything.

421
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,690
He hit the supernatural lottery.

422
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:25,940
He saw big foot the first
night he went looking.

423
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:26,601
Yeah.

424
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:27,291
The first night,

425
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,220
there are people up there,

426
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,290
there are people up there for years,

427
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,480
slowly going crazy under the moon.

428
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,070
This guy goes out one night,

429
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,220
bigfoot shows up,

430
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,780
did some calls that he
learned from watching TV,

431
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,531
TV,

432
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:40,220
bigfoot show.

433
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:40,971
So you know,

434
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:41,241
man,

435
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:44,570
the problem is that those
people are under super lucky.

436
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,430
Their problem is they're just lucky.

437
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,230
Super Lucky.

438
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:47,500
She's,

439
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,130
he's a magnet for paranormal activity.

440
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:51,911
Yeah,

441
00:15:51,911 --> 00:15:52,300
that's,

442
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,800
that's definitely what it is.

443
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:54,461
That's what he is.

444
00:15:54,461 --> 00:15:56,410
He's a magnet for the paranormal.

445
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,060
I just think that he is.

446
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,040
That would be hilarious if it was.

447
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,620
It was just like this guy who is just,

448
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:03,040
you know,

449
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,840
not the most charismatic guy,

450
00:16:04,841 --> 00:16:07,840
doesn't seem like you know
any different than you or I,

451
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,270
but yet the aliens just decided,

452
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:11,110
this is our guy.

453
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,670
This is why he's our go to dude.

454
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,170
Don't be an alcoholic.

455
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:14,561
Well,

456
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:18,580
maybe this is why don't live around
really stupid people because maybe the

457
00:16:18,581 --> 00:16:23,170
aliens landed in his town and
everybody else is like barely a monkey.

458
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,460
They're just apes.

459
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,370
Apes with a language and him in his town,

460
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,110
he's the dawn of the town,

461
00:16:29,111 --> 00:16:31,230
like he's the smartest guy for miles.

462
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,170
It's a rough town.

463
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,400
They'd looked around and they said,

464
00:16:33,401 --> 00:16:33,970
you know what?

465
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:34,930
This is our guy.

466
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,381
You know,

467
00:16:35,381 --> 00:16:37,420
they maybe they didn't do a really good,

468
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,170
accurate assessment of the
entire population and find
out who's the smartest guy

469
00:16:41,171 --> 00:16:41,810
here.

470
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,610
Okay,

471
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,740
let's go talk to Neil degrasse Tyson.

472
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:46,420
He seems to be totally on the ball.

473
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,610
He seems like the best guy
we could communicate with.

474
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,031
No,

475
00:16:49,031 --> 00:16:53,080
they showed up in some meth adult
shit hole of a town and it's fucking

476
00:16:53,081 --> 00:16:57,850
tumbleweeds flying by and people shooting
up in the corners and it's just a mess

477
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:58,691
everywhere you look.

478
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:03,020
Gambling addicts are stealing money and
everyone's on some fucking form crank

479
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,150
and uh,

480
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:09,150
they found all Ryan Ryan was washing his
truck and listen to like conservative

481
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:10,354
talk radio.

482
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,930
We seem to stock seems like a
normal guy and they're like,

483
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:14,764
we found the guy.

484
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,750
This is the best America has to offer.

485
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:17,763
They just didn't.

486
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,900
They look at us like we're so stupid.

487
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,430
Like the way we look at Champs,

488
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,250
I mean it takes a long time
studying chimps for you,

489
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,020
figuring out what's the
bad motherfucker champ,

490
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,500
what's the one champ that figured out
how to take the stick and widdle the end

491
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:31,600
of it so he can get the ants easier?

492
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,420
You know what,

493
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,460
what does the one chimp that figured
out how to mimic human behavior and do

494
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:37,294
certain things,

495
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,820
it takes a long time to find that guy.

496
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,050
So if there's so much more advanced
than us than we are from champs,

497
00:17:44,051 --> 00:17:45,400
if it's like that much of a leap,

498
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,680
they probably look at these idiots.

499
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,431
They probably look at it,

500
00:17:48,431 --> 00:17:49,980
this is a sea of idiots

501
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,100
or I find this one idiot
that's not eating his own poop.

502
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:57,240
Oh let's grab that guy and scoop him up
and let's show him everything was show

503
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:58,230
him everything and see if he can,

504
00:17:58,231 --> 00:17:58,411
uh,

505
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,244
you know,

506
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,160
perhaps a help us enlighten
this crazy species.

507
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:02,701
Man,

508
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:02,881
you're,

509
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:03,714
I think you're right.

510
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,561
Cause in by being,

511
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:05,011
by the way,

512
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:06,300
if I'm studying champs,

513
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,620
I'm going to pick the crazy one
because it's more interesting.

514
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,500
Who are you going to
take the normal champs?

515
00:18:12,501 --> 00:18:13,560
You're going to take the chimp.

516
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:14,760
It's off by himself,

517
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:19,500
by a tree drinking many vodkas
and staring into the sun,

518
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,590
making weird noises to
summon a mythical creature.

519
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,720
I get that day's sitting an Indian casino
way drunker than any buddy should be

520
00:18:27,991 --> 00:18:32,730
and be allowed to walk on
their own screaming expletives
cause they lost all the

521
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:35,400
money they've ever made
ever on a game of chance.

522
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah,

523
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,601
exactly.

524
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:38,010
That's the chimp you want to study.

525
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:42,330
Maybe aliens don't believe in crazy
people and they try to prove the crazy

526
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:46,470
people exist by finding them and taking
pictures of them may be aliens are smart

527
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:48,150
enough to avoid credible people.

528
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,900
Then they figured the best way to get
the information they need is to find

529
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:55,710
someone who already has a pension
for stretching the truth and a duck.

530
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:56,850
That motherfucker,

531
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,950
and then when you're done with them,

532
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,231
go,

533
00:18:58,231 --> 00:18:59,550
go tell your friends,

534
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,391
tell everyone,

535
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:01,620
go tell your friends.

536
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,401
That's what they say.

537
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:04,620
They put them on the
front door and they go,

538
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:05,070
go ahead.

539
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,910
Go tell your friends,

540
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:06,744
dude.

541
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,770
And he's just sitting there like,

542
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:08,604
fuck.

543
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,503
Hey,

544
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,640
you dropped your tequila bottle.

545
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,010
Don't forget your Tequila when you leave.

546
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:14,251
Oh,

547
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:14,791
don't worry.

548
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,680
You've got plenty of meth in your urine.

549
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,590
You're going to come up clean.

550
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,401
Get outta here,

551
00:19:20,401 --> 00:19:21,000
dude.

552
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,340
So the guy goes to the police
department and tells a story,

553
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:24,180
pisses in a cop,

554
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:24,511
and they go,

555
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:25,560
get the fuck outta here.

556
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,550
What's in here?

557
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,740
This can get me how I could drink
this and get high for a month.

558
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:29,790
Feed it.

559
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,390
Get out of here.

560
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,800
Scrammed storyteller.

561
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,030
It's really smart.

562
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,260
It's genius.

563
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,820
It's a genius thing to do.

564
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:36,420
It's true.

565
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,850
The last thing you want to
do is have duct some logical.

566
00:19:38,851 --> 00:19:39,121
Yeah,

567
00:19:39,121 --> 00:19:39,960
Obama have.

568
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:42,690
Obama feels compelled to tell the
world and they actually listen.

569
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,050
People alter their behavior.

570
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:47,490
Start looking for Ufo is put on
special glasses like and they live.

571
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,770
Remember that movie?

572
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,770
Rowdy Roddy Piper,

573
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,630
John Carpenter at school.

574
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,070
No one's gonna believe Obama.

575
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,450
How dare you?

576
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,820
No one believes it when he
talks about anything alien.

577
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,310
Maybe that would be perfect.

578
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,620
That will be the ultimate cover.

579
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,600
Come straight to Obama and that's
the one thing they'd be like,

580
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,151
everybody's like,

581
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:03,541
you know what,

582
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,080
this guy,

583
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,250
we got to get them out of office.

584
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,080
Like everybody's fine with drones.

585
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,970
Everybody's fine with
paying off the banks.

586
00:20:08,971 --> 00:20:12,480
Everybody's fine with arresting
people for medical marijuana.

587
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,620
Everybody's fine with everything,

588
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,970
but he says he saw a Ufo.

589
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,500
This motherfucker goods,

590
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,560
get him out of here.

591
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:21,931
God,

592
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:23,220
that'd be fun to be an alien.

593
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:23,481
Wouldn't are.

594
00:20:23,481 --> 00:20:28,380
You get to get to suck anybody into your
ship and do anything you want to them.

595
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,970
No one can call the police.

596
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:30,661
Just drop them off.

597
00:20:30,661 --> 00:20:30,970
Go,

598
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,010
go tell your friends.

599
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,320
Yeah.

600
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,420
Tell her to shreds.

601
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,141
By the way,

602
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:35,220
we're invisible to everybody,

603
00:20:35,221 --> 00:20:36,640
but you know,

604
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,090
I mean you don't think that
they can make you invisible.

605
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:39,751
I mean,

606
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:42,270
it seems to me that if you can
come here from another planet,

607
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,070
pretty much you do anything.

608
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,770
Whatever you can manipulate in our world.

609
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:47,381
You,

610
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:47,711
you know,

611
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:48,220
you might

612
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,300
be a bulletproof wolf.

613
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:51,220
Maybe that's like the best way to show up.

614
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:51,540
Sure.

615
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,810
See a wolf that you can go ahead,

616
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:53,644
shoot me.

617
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,750
You pretend that they hurt
you and then you fly away.

618
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,610
He turned into mist and you vanish.

619
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,181
Why don't we,

620
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:02,720
why would we assume that they're
limited in their ability to exist in,

621
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:07,180
in matter the way we are just
contained by this biological prison.

622
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,360
Yeah.

623
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,190
Maybe they can be missed shipment.

624
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:09,881
Maybe they can do it.

625
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:12,400
Maybe they just appear out of nowhere.

626
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:12,671
I mean,

627
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:16,120
they don't get in big stupid ships
like we do and fly through the air.

628
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:16,841
Maybe they're like,

629
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:17,291
oh my God,

630
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,160
they're still doing that.

631
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:18,641
Do you know,

632
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:21,850
do you can just become mist and
appear as like a wolf or something?

633
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,450
Yes.

634
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,440
Maybe they do that.

635
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:23,650
I mean,

636
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,430
why not?

637
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,350
Wouldn't you know,

638
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:26,890
that's,

639
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,640
listen,

640
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,300
if,

641
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,560
now this is a big if,

642
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,380
but one of the gentlemen that I talked to,

643
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,233
um,

644
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,193
to real,

645
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,063
what's his first name?

646
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,933
Rich Terrile.

647
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,680
One of the gentleman that I talked to,

648
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:38,981
this guy,

649
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:39,830
rich to real.

650
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,770
It's from the JPL labs.

651
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,041
All right.

652
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,660
This guy's super smart.

653
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,673
Jpl Lamb.

654
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,271
I don't know what they do there,

655
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,530
but it's very important.

656
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,870
Very important rocket sciency type stuff.

657
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,490
Yeah.

658
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:54,220
Well we were talking about simulation
theory and one of the things brought up

659
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:58,660
about simulation theory was if you don't
know that you're in a simulation and as

660
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:01,540
you're in that simulation you
create another simulation.

661
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:06,250
Like what did that sort of mimic the
fractal behavior that the whole universe

662
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,650
seems to exist or seems to,

663
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,230
seems to show that exists everywhere.

664
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:12,064
Everywhere you look,

665
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,780
whether it's the FIBONACCI sequence,

666
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,420
the way it applied self
to sunflower seeds,

667
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:21,370
or just the fact that you go into the
atoms themselves and there's so much space

668
00:22:21,371 --> 00:22:21,760
there.

669
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,121
Yes.

670
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:23,330
It's almost like the,

671
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:23,680
uh,

672
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,880
like the universe.

673
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:30,300
And if that's the case and if what we're
looking at is just a representation of

674
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,760
an artificially created world and
inside that artificially created world,

675
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,570
we're working feverishly to
create another artificial world.

676
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,100
If that's the case,

677
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:47,430
then maybe alien life is just simply
someone who decides to present itself as

678
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,490
that inside the simulation.

679
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:51,911
I mean,

680
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:54,700
if we really are a completely
in a world of ones and Zeros,

681
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:59,080
we may really be limited by our
imagination more than we're limited by

682
00:22:59,081 --> 00:22:59,950
possibilities.

683
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:05,190
We just seem to only be capable of
imagining things that someone has already

684
00:23:06,431 --> 00:23:07,300
documented,

685
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,230
whether it's a tiger or
a shark or a tornado,

686
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,270
it's these things are documented,

687
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,500
so we'll accept them.

688
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,650
But maybe if it's a simulation,

689
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:20,200
there's some shit out there that we
just haven't seen in the game yet.

690
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:20,500
Yeah,

691
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,890
there's some new levels
to the movie where you,

692
00:23:22,891 --> 00:23:23,141
you know,

693
00:23:23,141 --> 00:23:27,090
you pass this area and all of a sudden
you're in a magic land and bulletproof

694
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,600
walls exist and turn out a mist and they
land on your porch and they look at you

695
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:32,200
and you shoot him in.

696
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,033
They vanish.

697
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,491
I mean,

698
00:23:33,491 --> 00:23:34,500
the uh,

699
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:40,350
ability to have wireless communication
existed when people were beating each

700
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:46,250
other's heads and with rocks and
worshiping golden the same time

701
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,390
always been there.

702
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:49,160
It's just they hadn't discovered it yet.

703
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,240
So it's true.

704
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,590
No doubt there's some amazing
technology or some amazing,

705
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,220
uh,

706
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,210
law in the universe that we haven't
quite discovered yet that eventually we

707
00:23:59,211 --> 00:23:59,511
will,

708
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:04,511
that will be as disruptive to society is
every other invention or discovery like

709
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:05,990
that.

710
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:10,990
But these discoveries are not made
generally by people who stink of Jen.

711
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,310
Okay.

712
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,000
And who go wandering
drunk through the desert,

713
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,500
staring up into space.

714
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:23,160
These discoveries are made by people
who have an inclination and impulse and

715
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:28,161
I've studied a lot of science and know
the process that you can uncover these

716
00:24:28,381 --> 00:24:29,040
laws,

717
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,730
which is why it's so important to
approach these things from a scientific

718
00:24:32,731 --> 00:24:37,350
perspective because otherwise you
end up with an unprovable thing.

719
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:38,460
Maybe you saw something,

720
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,790
but the fact that you're not approaching
it scientifically immediately

721
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:42,624
discredits you.

722
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:47,820
You said something that was very
important and I want to reassert it.

723
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:53,370
You said that the ability to
communicate wirelessly always existed.

724
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,930
We just hadn't figured it out yet.

725
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,680
Yes,

726
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,570
but it always existed just we didn't
have the technology to unearth it.

727
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,800
That's such an important point that
you made and I don't think people could

728
00:25:05,801 --> 00:25:07,300
really wrap their head around that.

729
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,190
It's really hard to,

730
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,010
we can sort of see the future
like a little bit in the future,

731
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:12,761
like we think about it,

732
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,590
but whenever we've tried to guess,

733
00:25:14,591 --> 00:25:16,060
we're always so off,

734
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:16,871
you know?

735
00:25:16,871 --> 00:25:18,160
Like do you ever watch space?

736
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,050
1999 now.

737
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,430
I was a great show.

738
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:22,451
It was a great show,

739
00:25:22,451 --> 00:25:25,030
but it was 14 years ago supposedly.

740
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,570
I mean the show is made in the 70s
or the eighties or something like,

741
00:25:28,571 --> 00:25:33,571
I think it was the 70s and it was supposed
to be about the future and in 1999

742
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,360
like space 1999 this is going to be crazy.

743
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,630
We're just going to be living in the
galaxy in 1999 like there's so off.

744
00:25:40,631 --> 00:25:41,950
Everybody's always off.

745
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:42,941
But you know what?

746
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:46,060
They never saw on space down at 99 Google.

747
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,110
Right.

748
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,550
They didn't have all the answers.

749
00:25:48,551 --> 00:25:49,690
They didn't know where they were going.

750
00:25:49,691 --> 00:25:50,141
They couldn't,

751
00:25:50,141 --> 00:25:51,700
they didn't have navigation systems.

752
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,110
They didn't have any of that shit.

753
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,610
They didn't have cell phones.

754
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,473
Okay.

755
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,060
They talked to each other.

756
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,810
It was like a walkie
talkie type situation,

757
00:25:59,380 --> 00:25:59,660
you know,

758
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,660
like in the and the enterprise Kirk out.

759
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:02,250
No,

760
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,660
nobody saw what we have right now.

761
00:26:04,661 --> 00:26:06,130
That is completely insane.

762
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,611
That's right.

763
00:26:06,611 --> 00:26:06,821
I mean,

764
00:26:06,821 --> 00:26:10,390
we literally have the power of immortals.

765
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,250
If we lived a thousand years ago,

766
00:26:12,251 --> 00:26:16,120
we would be some strange
freak existence that,

767
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:16,361
you know,

768
00:26:16,361 --> 00:26:18,310
people had never seen a
guy with a cell phone,

769
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:21,190
never seen a guy in a car
pull up with a cell phone,

770
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,540
never see a guy step out with sunglasses
on and have a machine gun in his hand.

771
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:29,350
All the things that we have
today that seemed like an insane,

772
00:26:29,351 --> 00:26:30,340
impossible,

773
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,650
unimaginable things a thousand years ago.

774
00:26:32,651 --> 00:26:33,341
They're totally,

775
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,940
completely 100% common.

776
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:35,361
Yeah.

777
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:35,760
You take,

778
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,590
you pluck someone from a thousand years
ago and drop them into any city in the

779
00:26:39,591 --> 00:26:41,000
world and they might go crazy

780
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,000
or pluck someone from a thousand years
the future and who knows what kind of

781
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:46,200
shape you can take.

782
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,590
Right?

783
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,251
Who knows what,

784
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:47,870
what,

785
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,150
you know,

786
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,350
whether or not you,

787
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,830
you can even tell a port consciousness
into other objects and ideas.

788
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,590
We have no idea what's
going to be possible.

789
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,520
And once they start figuring out a way to,

790
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:03,690
to put technology deeper and deeper
into our lives or we ever become part

791
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,490
technology ourselves.

792
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,880
Some form of Cyborg.

793
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:07,560
Yeah.

794
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,270
Anything is fucking
possible when that happen.

795
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,951
That's right.

796
00:27:09,951 --> 00:27:10,970
Anything's possible.

797
00:27:10,971 --> 00:27:14,330
And it's the people who have the most
open minds that end up making the

798
00:27:14,331 --> 00:27:16,640
discoveries that transform history.

799
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:21,710
So that's why it's important for people
to not be afraid to explore these

800
00:27:21,711 --> 00:27:22,011
things.

801
00:27:22,011 --> 00:27:23,510
It's just the way you explore it.

802
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,980
It's gotta be precise,

803
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,250
right?

804
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,630
Because if you aren't precise,

805
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,190
then you end up in a lot of trouble.

806
00:27:28,191 --> 00:27:28,600
I mean,

807
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,130
it's best case you end up
wandering through the desert.

808
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,850
Maybe you fall into an ants nest cause
you're a little too drunk and you know,

809
00:27:34,851 --> 00:27:36,110
you go home with some stinks.

810
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,130
Worst case,

811
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,800
you've got a little bit more
charisma than that Fella had,

812
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:40,581
you know?

813
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:44,780
And then you start telling other people
like you that you can communicate with

814
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,910
bigfoot and they all say what?

815
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,780
Really?

816
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,350
Yeah,

817
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:53,060
I communicate with big foot and he
told me that I should start a church.

818
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,320
And the next thing you know,

819
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,460
you've got someone who's started a
new religion about worshiping bigfoot,

820
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,580
surrounded by equally nutty people who
have no interest in proving anything at

821
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:04,340
all.

822
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,870
And then that's how religions start.

823
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,150
And then you know what
inevitably happens next?

824
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:12,200
The person says that big foot came to
them and a dream and said that they have

825
00:28:12,201 --> 00:28:13,580
to have sex with your wife.

826
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,580
I don't know why he wants me to do that,

827
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,650
but he wants me to do that.

828
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:19,940
He wants me to do that.

829
00:28:19,941 --> 00:28:21,650
Or the bulletproof wolf will come

830
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,470
and that's how religion started.

831
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:27,530
That's how it starts,

832
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:28,230
man.

833
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,570
And that's why it's dangerous.

834
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,720
And that's why people like that have to
be held to actual scientific principles.

835
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,560
Because if they're not,

836
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,290
then they can cause a lot of problems.

837
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:39,871
That's awesome.

838
00:28:39,871 --> 00:28:41,070
Why were we talked about before?

839
00:28:41,071 --> 00:28:43,290
It's important to hang out
with people that are smart.

840
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,420
If you hang out with a
bunch of dumb people,

841
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,860
especially if you're that guy,

842
00:28:46,861 --> 00:28:48,660
if you can just tell
them things like that,

843
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:50,100
like you met a bulletproof wolf and like,

844
00:28:50,101 --> 00:28:50,490
Whoa,

845
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,323
where's the wolf?

846
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:52,950
You tell that guy anyway.

847
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,130
You'd start making things up just to
keep yourself entertained because you're,

848
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,120
you're dealing with uh,

849
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,013
an ape.

850
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,400
You know your friends and ape.

851
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,170
Right and completely stupid.

852
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,130
There's people out there
that'll just like that.

853
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,200
Once you have a person near you who
believes that you saw a bulletproof messed

854
00:29:08,691 --> 00:29:09,524
wolf,

855
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,600
you can definitely get them
to give you a blow job.

856
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:14,511
Easy,

857
00:29:14,511 --> 00:29:15,344
easy,

858
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,041
easy.

859
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:19,460
You could tell them that the aliens
told them that you have to give them a

860
00:29:19,461 --> 00:29:21,170
blowjob or everyone will die.

861
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:21,520
Yeah.

862
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,380
Baby's first.

863
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:22,890
Yeah,

864
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:23,770
you got to do it.

865
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,620
Get up there.

866
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,330
I don't want to,

867
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:25,891
by the way,

868
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:28,230
I don't want you to give me a blowjob.

869
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,093
This hurts.

870
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,230
Last thing I want,

871
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,090
but if you don't,

872
00:29:32,091 --> 00:29:33,170
all the babies die.

873
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:33,740
Yeah.

874
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,200
His thing eats babies and it's
going to come from a wormhole.

875
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,330
Alright.

876
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,110
Where am are great too,

877
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,060
because you don't have
to show a launch area.

878
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:44,680
You don't have to like
pretend that there's like a
secret spot where you got to

879
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:45,514
go to.

880
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,430
You know when it's,

881
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,570
when it's a wormhole with something as
simple as a worm hall just sits there.

882
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:50,470
It's not whatever.

883
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,593
Yeah.

884
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,210
I'm sorry.

885
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,043
What's round?

886
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,100
Every time you move you
put it on the unsightly me.

887
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,003
This

888
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,243
on the cable?

889
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,093
Yeah.

890
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,800
Every time we move the cable connecting.

891
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,663
Oh,

892
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,121
okay.

893
00:30:05,121 --> 00:30:06,170
Here I'll put it in the front.

894
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,030
Thank you.

895
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:07,863
No problem.

896
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,203
Okay.

897
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,600
Babies and monsters.

898
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,750
Do you want to talk?

899
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,670
Where was I?

900
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,503
You were talking

901
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:18,860
babies

902
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,281
baby.

903
00:30:19,281 --> 00:30:19,491
Yeah.

904
00:30:19,491 --> 00:30:19,970
You were saying?

905
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:20,151
Yeah.

906
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,840
You were saying that you convince these
people that the bulletproof wolf eats

907
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,190
babies if they don't give you blowjobs.

908
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,383
Yeah,

909
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,381
it's not likely,

910
00:30:27,381 --> 00:30:28,420
but it probably could happen.

911
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:29,181
It's not likely.

912
00:30:29,181 --> 00:30:29,821
I mean God,

913
00:30:29,821 --> 00:30:30,830
look at religion.

914
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,120
Look at religion.

915
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,890
I mean I was just telling
you about this on the,

916
00:30:33,891 --> 00:30:35,780
I don't know if I was just telling
you about this on the phone,

917
00:30:35,781 --> 00:30:37,310
but Joseph Smith.

918
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:37,820
Yeah.

919
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,031
What?

920
00:30:38,031 --> 00:30:42,680
Tell girls that they had to marry
him or they would be damned to hell.

921
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,900
Now what's the difference?

922
00:30:44,901 --> 00:30:45,111
It's,

923
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:45,950
see that's the problem.

924
00:30:45,951 --> 00:30:47,390
If someone had gone to him and said,

925
00:30:47,391 --> 00:30:47,601
look,

926
00:30:47,601 --> 00:30:50,780
you've got to prove this thing telling
you that you can have sex with my

927
00:30:50,781 --> 00:30:52,670
daughter before you have sex with her.

928
00:30:52,671 --> 00:30:53,510
I want some proof.

929
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,583
Measure it.

930
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,630
Show me the tablets I want is,

931
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,850
I want to know who this thing is.

932
00:30:58,851 --> 00:31:03,110
It's telling you that you to stick
your penis and my daughter religiously,

933
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:03,771
you know,

934
00:31:03,771 --> 00:31:08,300
you have to hold people accountable for
stuff like that or they will hum pew.

935
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,730
That's the inevitable result of this man.

936
00:31:10,731 --> 00:31:15,320
The slippery slope ends with you laying
back in the desert with some guys

937
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:20,840
sitting on your face like a saddle
is lumping your mouth kind of

938
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:21,551
doesn't roll.

939
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:25,210
Kind of all go back to what we discovered
when we went looking for big foot.

940
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,740
It's really,

941
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,281
it's kind of,

942
00:31:27,281 --> 00:31:32,281
there's a similar thing going on because
it's all people that are getting very

943
00:31:33,011 --> 00:31:34,420
little physical affection,

944
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,501
you know?

945
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:40,501
And this is why they have the free
time to be out there looking for Ufo.

946
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:41,310
Yeah.

947
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,300
It's like nobody wants to fuck them.

948
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:47,110
And so because of that
you develop this deficit.

949
00:31:47,111 --> 00:31:49,600
This is a desperate need for mystery.

950
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:54,930
Desperate need to somehow another
validate the emptiness that is regular,

951
00:31:55,481 --> 00:32:00,481
normal life with big foot or with
Ufo shows or with fill in the blank.

952
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,880
What or whatever crazy
thing you blink Jervis,

953
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,810
Jersey Devil,

954
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,651
what do you believe in?

955
00:32:05,651 --> 00:32:06,101
Loch ness,

956
00:32:06,101 --> 00:32:06,934
monster,

957
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,530
UFO abduction.

958
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:08,831
Well,

959
00:32:08,831 --> 00:32:09,431
whatever it is,

960
00:32:09,431 --> 00:32:10,320
reputation,

961
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,253
all of it.

962
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,123
Channeling,

963
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,350
so she's a channel or in a healer.

964
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,610
Oh really?

965
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,060
It's very frightening of
you cause that's what you,

966
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,830
it's like from a Freudian perspective,

967
00:32:19,831 --> 00:32:24,270
what you're saying is that
they're oppressed sex drive
manifests in these kind

968
00:32:24,271 --> 00:32:26,970
of the hallucinations or wish fulfillment,

969
00:32:26,971 --> 00:32:27,660
illusions,

970
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:32,400
delusions and you know also I think it
puts you in a community of people that

971
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:37,350
are also idiots are more
likely to hump here because?

972
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,770
Because I like more gullible.

973
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,060
Yeah and easier to have sex with because
they're gullible because they lack

974
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:47,000
critical thinking skills and
you can tell them crazy stories.

975
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:48,470
They're much more likely
to have sex with you.

976
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,350
It's not a new idea.

977
00:32:51,351 --> 00:32:52,490
It's not a bad idea.

978
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,700
Look if we know that the
primary motivation for most
males 18 to 34 or whatever

979
00:32:58,281 --> 00:32:59,114
the hell it is,

980
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,950
demo is spreading,

981
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:01,401
spreading,

982
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:03,200
and spreading sexuality,

983
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:03,980
getting,

984
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:08,090
getting into position to
have as much sex as possible,

985
00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:10,580
as often as possible with people
that are as pretty as possible.

986
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,350
We all agree to that.

987
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:16,750
We know that it's the motivation behind
flashy cars and jewelry and $50,000

988
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,593
watches.

989
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,860
If there's only men on the planet.

990
00:33:18,861 --> 00:33:20,840
Do you think they sell
any $50,000 watches?

991
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:21,051
No.

992
00:33:21,051 --> 00:33:22,400
No one would buy one.

993
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,360
We wouldn't give a fuck.

994
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:24,680
No one's going to have sex with you.

995
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,130
You know,

996
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,000
unless you're gay,

997
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,260
you wouldn't buy that watch.

998
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:27,920
Okay?

999
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,920
But if you factor in all the reasons
why people do all the things they do,

1000
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,180
buy the biggest house where the flat,

1001
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:36,020
fanciest clothes,

1002
00:33:36,021 --> 00:33:36,854
he's always sharp.

1003
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:37,161
What?

1004
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:37,520
He's,

1005
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,960
they're setting themselves up to be a
primary sexual candidate and when that no

1006
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:43,070
longer applies,

1007
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,230
where's your motivation for life?

1008
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:47,630
Where's your motivation
to get up in the morning?

1009
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:47,830
What do you,

1010
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,381
what are you doing?

1011
00:33:48,381 --> 00:33:49,160
What's going on in there?

1012
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,910
There's no more libido and you're not
even remotely attractive so you can either

1013
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:56,150
scrape up enough money doing what
you do really good and pay for it,

1014
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,680
which always feels gross.

1015
00:33:57,681 --> 00:33:59,270
I'm sure never done it.

1016
00:33:59,540 --> 00:33:59,990
Never.

1017
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,980
Well me.

1018
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,933
You know what I'm saying?

1019
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:06,380
Even if I did what I'm
saying is it would be sad.

1020
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:11,440
It was sad to be some 60 year old dude
who worked his whole life to put together

1021
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:17,150
a meager bank roll and every couple of
months he blows some of it on an escort

1022
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:22,670
and in between that he's looking
for Ufo was to stay out there too.

1023
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,700
We've got,

1024
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,430
we were basically locked down.

1025
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:26,690
We've got a hundred percent proof now.

1026
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,330
What we got here is a smoking gun.

1027
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:33,950
This guy actually told us
and signed an affidavit.

1028
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:34,903
We got the gun,

1029
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,320
we got the smoking gun.

1030
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:36,831
That's right here.

1031
00:34:36,831 --> 00:34:37,041
Look,

1032
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:37,880
it's been done.

1033
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,410
If you don't believe in Ufo Ufos,

1034
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,273
you're crazy.

1035
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:40,760
Okay,

1036
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,600
cause we got it all.

1037
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,380
We've got it here.

1038
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,240
We got it now because
he's a very exciting time.

1039
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:44,480
Yeah,

1040
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,790
they released this information
is going to be no denying.

1041
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:50,900
We've got top level people from all
areas of the government who come out with

1042
00:34:50,901 --> 00:34:52,040
amazing stories.

1043
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,680
And once you hear those stories
and it will be undeniable,

1044
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,940
and then they give themselves just like
sense of excitement along with reciting

1045
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:00,650
this stuff and talking about this stuff.

1046
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,510
These mysteries are getting young covered,

1047
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,520
but they never tell him to have her do.

1048
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,750
It's a mating dance.

1049
00:35:05,751 --> 00:35:06,950
It's part of the mating dance.

1050
00:35:06,951 --> 00:35:07,784
It's like a tail.

1051
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,650
They pop up the book,

1052
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:10,940
big foot tail feather,

1053
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,510
pop up the Ufo tail feather at
you do that after a few drinks,

1054
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:15,480
you know,

1055
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,810
and it kind of dark bar you'd say like,

1056
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:18,470
look,

1057
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,550
I don't tell a lot of people,

1058
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,470
but I had an incredible encounter
in the desert a few weeks ago.

1059
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,360
And uh,

1060
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:26,781
look,

1061
00:35:26,781 --> 00:35:26,910
I,

1062
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,500
I probably shouldn't tell you know what,

1063
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,334
what happened?

1064
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,613
Um,

1065
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,290
well first it started off as a mist.

1066
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:36,770
You know,

1067
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,650
you're at,

1068
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:44,310
it turned into a wolf and
then you started a little,

1069
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,300
maybe a little crying,

1070
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:46,710
like you're a little upset about it.

1071
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:47,941
Next thing you know,

1072
00:35:47,941 --> 00:35:52,941
you're back in the days in enjoying a
nice roll in the Hay with somebody that

1073
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:54,300
you've probably drugged.

1074
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,540
You know what's weird about the
people that tell these stories to,

1075
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,520
this is one thing that I've been noticing.

1076
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:04,920
There's people that will tell
these stories and they'll
tell it to you in a way

1077
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:07,710
where you feel like they're
recounting a memory.

1078
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,670
You know,

1079
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,930
like Mike Miller,

1080
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:10,531
that's his name,

1081
00:36:10,531 --> 00:36:10,800
right?

1082
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,400
Like know,

1083
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,240
like Mike Miller,

1084
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,400
he fell to me that he
was recounting a memory,

1085
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,380
but other people that we talk to just
we're saying a bunch of words in order.

1086
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,280
It's like it was complete.

1087
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:26,330
There's a complete flatness to the way
they described these encounters that

1088
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,290
doesn't register with you at all.

1089
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,220
Like did talk to you.

1090
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:29,730
They're like,

1091
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:30,001
well,

1092
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:33,960
I went into the woods and we started
doing these sacred howl and uh,

1093
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:35,700
all of a sudden we saw the,

1094
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,120
um,

1095
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:41,120
the pyramid in the sky opened up and a
from it came this alien craft and you're

1096
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:43,650
just hearing a bunch of words.

1097
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,010
You don't,

1098
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:44,370
there's,

1099
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:49,260
there's nothing connected to this person
is there's nothing connecting them with

1100
00:36:49,261 --> 00:36:50,070
that story.

1101
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,770
And there's nothing connecting
you with that story.

1102
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:56,490
They're not trying to connect you with
that story to trying to say the words in

1103
00:36:56,491 --> 00:37:01,170
order that they think would make sense
if you were talking about a crazy

1104
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:02,160
incident that happened,

1105
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,620
but it was clearly an incident
that didn't really happen to them.

1106
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,690
And there's a sense that
we all have for that.

1107
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:07,680
It's not bulletproof.

1108
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:08,610
It's not,

1109
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:13,380
it's not 100% but this is a sense that
you have when someone's telling you a

1110
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:15,030
story where you know they're full of shit.

1111
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:15,903
Yes.

1112
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:16,710
And uh,

1113
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,790
that's a weird thing.

1114
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,640
It's a weird thing to be in front of
people when you know they're not telling

1115
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:21,330
you the truth,

1116
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,590
but we all know what it's like.

1117
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,191
W We,

1118
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:24,870
it's not that people can't trick us.

1119
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,490
People certainly can trick you,

1120
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,100
but when you know someone's full of Shit,

1121
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,140
you really do know they're full of shit.

1122
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,213
You know what I'm saying?

1123
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,920
It's not 100% it doesn't
work with everyone.

1124
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:36,600
And there are people that are sociopaths.

1125
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:38,580
They are people that are
really good at lying.

1126
00:37:38,581 --> 00:37:43,530
There are people that are very charismatic
and can con people that can steal

1127
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:44,610
your money then yes.

1128
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:44,881
Bill,

1129
00:37:44,881 --> 00:37:46,740
you either they're experts at lying.

1130
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:47,250
Sure.

1131
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,083
Actors.

1132
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:48,511
I mean what,

1133
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:48,791
what are,

1134
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:50,700
what does being an actor is being a liar?

1135
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:51,020
Yeah.

1136
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,270
You know,

1137
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,310
I'm not saying that they would
lose it in their personal life,

1138
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:55,980
but Daniel Day Lewis would be the greatest
fucking liar and the history of the

1139
00:37:55,981 --> 00:37:58,620
world's thinking about how good
that guy will be at lying to you.

1140
00:37:58,890 --> 00:37:59,370
You know,

1141
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:03,080
did you spill the milk and he comes down
and he looks like he has an eat in a

1142
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,100
week.

1143
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,770
He's fucking hobbling and yeah,

1144
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,100
cause it shits his pants
while he's talking to you.

1145
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,531
You know,

1146
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:08,070
that guy would,

1147
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:08,820
you'd be like,

1148
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,653
oh for sure.

1149
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,380
That guy didn't spell them out for lie.

1150
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,300
He's telling me the truth.

1151
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,420
He's crying as poor guy has like
he's got cerebral palsy or something.

1152
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:15,720
Yeah.

1153
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,120
Let me take him to the bathroom and clean
him up and he punches you in the face

1154
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:18,954
and rapes you.

1155
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,740
You know why?

1156
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,030
Cause he was faking it the whole time.

1157
00:38:21,031 --> 00:38:24,240
He just wanted to get you to where
you were alone with them in a bathroom

1158
00:38:24,241 --> 00:38:25,470
washing his ass,

1159
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:28,440
cause he can't wash it himself
and then he just beats the shit

1160
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,310
we doing.

1161
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,020
This is like our erotic Daniel Day,

1162
00:38:31,021 --> 00:38:32,550
Lewis and fiction.

1163
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,290
I don't even know what it is.

1164
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:36,160
Like you didn't even know
I'm doing or you went

1165
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,941
down the road.

1166
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:38,260
How did he end up in your house?

1167
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,370
We started talking.

1168
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,780
I just made all that up.

1169
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:41,321
But that's,

1170
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:43,200
that's the universe
giving me a little gift.

1171
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:43,960
It's a gift of,

1172
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,160
it's called creativity.

1173
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,460
I love the idea and over comes from,

1174
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:49,270
it's just a gift.

1175
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:49,781
I love the,

1176
00:38:49,781 --> 00:38:50,231
this is my,

1177
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:52,480
I love the idea of like
someone spilled milk.

1178
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,860
Daniel Day Lewis comes in,

1179
00:38:53,861 --> 00:38:54,070
you know,

1180
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,210
did you spill the milk?

1181
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:55,751
He's like,

1182
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:56,170
no,

1183
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,120
suddenly you're washing his asshole.

1184
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,760
He shits all over himself cause
he's scared because he's scared him.

1185
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,330
He pretends that he's really
sick and feeble and you,

1186
00:39:04,331 --> 00:39:05,141
you yelled at him.

1187
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:06,700
So he just defecates all over himself.

1188
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,830
He's crying but he can't wash himself.

1189
00:39:08,831 --> 00:39:09,664
And that's one of the reasons,

1190
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,410
I mean snots coming out of his nose,

1191
00:39:11,411 --> 00:39:12,340
he's weeping.

1192
00:39:12,341 --> 00:39:13,510
He can't even breathe.

1193
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,830
He's doing it so well.

1194
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:16,780
You feel terrible and you're like,

1195
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:17,750
we'll clean you up on it.

1196
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,593
We'll clean you up.

1197
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,540
So as you're cleaning,

1198
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:22,060
he just beats the shit out
of you on fucks your mouth.

1199
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:24,970
He holds you down,

1200
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:28,480
just punches you in the face until you're
unconscious and you know you wake up

1201
00:39:28,481 --> 00:39:30,910
because you can't breathe out of your
mouth because it's filled with caulk.

1202
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,270
Try to get some air through your nose.

1203
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:34,421
What?

1204
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:35,171
Daniel Day Lewis,

1205
00:39:35,171 --> 00:39:36,310
just fucking your mouth.

1206
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,381
Why?

1207
00:39:38,381 --> 00:39:39,610
Because he's an awesome liar.

1208
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,420
He tricked you.

1209
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,450
He got you a bitch again.

1210
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,453
And I think that that,

1211
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:46,030
I think that's one of the most important
things a person can talk about.

1212
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:51,280
Points that I think that's the important
point is that there is a slippery slope

1213
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,700
when you're around a wire that we'll
end with that liars cock in their math.

1214
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:58,810
But I think there's this,

1215
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:02,080
there's a real slippery
slope with human beings.

1216
00:40:02,081 --> 00:40:07,081
If you are around someone who's trying
to be deceptive in order to profit on

1217
00:40:07,511 --> 00:40:10,190
something or trick you into something,

1218
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,480
someone who gets really good at
figuring out how to pretend that they're

1219
00:40:14,481 --> 00:40:15,221
something they're not,

1220
00:40:15,221 --> 00:40:19,000
or they seen something they haven't
just in order to get something from you,

1221
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,630
whether it's your attention
or whether it's your money.

1222
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:25,120
There's a weird thing
where people realize like,

1223
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:25,361
oh,

1224
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:26,890
I don't have to tell the truth.

1225
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:32,080
What I have to do is just make up a
good story that allows me to get into a

1226
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:36,360
situation or I'm on TV
telling this story yet.

1227
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,750
And so that's what they do.

1228
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,960
They just sort of like lumped together
this idea in their head and maybe they

1229
00:40:43,391 --> 00:40:44,100
rehearse it,

1230
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,010
maybe they wing it,

1231
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:48,670
and in that case you just keep asking
him about it over and over again over a

1232
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:49,510
long period of time.

1233
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,740
And they slowly start.

1234
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:53,590
It's twisting that story around because
they don't remember what the hell they

1235
00:40:53,591 --> 00:40:54,310
told you.

1236
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:54,820
Listen,

1237
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,380
there's so much money in it,

1238
00:40:56,381 --> 00:40:56,681
man.

1239
00:40:56,681 --> 00:40:59,440
I show much money if bills.

1240
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,390
Look at the Vatican.

1241
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,380
I mean,

1242
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,220
my God,

1243
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,760
the moment you can convince people that
you're in contact with a thing you can't

1244
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:09,880
take pictures of or prove
and they believe you,

1245
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,530
you are loaded.

1246
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,450
You can get so rich and religion has
shown this again and again and again.

1247
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:18,520
I mean these people take
it to the nth degree.

1248
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,361
There are these,

1249
00:41:19,361 --> 00:41:19,660
you know,

1250
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,070
the people we ran into in the desert,

1251
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:24,630
the guy thinks he saw a wolf that
turns into mist and big foot.

1252
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:28,900
If we drive 10 miles in any
direction and go to a church,

1253
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:34,080
I can sit you down with a person who
thinks that there is living in the sky

1254
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:38,600
and invisible man that is going
to destroy all of humanity.

1255
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,520
Uh,

1256
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,330
it's all going to happen in Israel.

1257
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:45,380
Now that's within 15 miles
in the difference between
the guy wandering drunk in

1258
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:50,060
the desert and the person wearing the
funny priest outfit is the priest has

1259
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:53,600
people who give him money every
week to listen to that story.

1260
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,100
They drop it in the,

1261
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:59,460
they drop it in the collections plate and
send that thing around and just listen

1262
00:41:59,461 --> 00:42:00,890
to that story again and again.

1263
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,360
The man in the sky forgives
you sins and he comes down,

1264
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,650
he comes down.

1265
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,180
If we're all good and ready,

1266
00:42:08,181 --> 00:42:11,930
he'll come down and take us
away from this terrible planet.

1267
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,880
No more bulletproof Wolfe's,

1268
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:16,880
no more big foot's just
peace and love forever.

1269
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,270
That's a gigantic business right now.

1270
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,580
Those people don't even have to pay taxes.

1271
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,770
There's such good liars.

1272
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,330
Did they have convinced the United
States government to not take taxes from

1273
00:42:29,331 --> 00:42:31,370
their multibillion dollar businesses?

1274
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,690
Wow.

1275
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,950
That's amazing.

1276
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,300
And that's the end of the thing.

1277
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:36,740
And that's the end of the thing.

1278
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,120
So they're the same thing.

1279
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:38,700
They're,

1280
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,010
they're on the spectrum.

1281
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,750
They're the successful version of it.

1282
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:45,380
The non successful version is the guy
who stinks of Gen wandering through the

1283
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:48,950
forest pointing at mud puddles and
telling you it's big foot footprint.

1284
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:54,130
The successful version of it is the guy
wearing robes and gold and sitting in a

1285
00:42:54,891 --> 00:42:57,620
golden throne and telling the
planet that they shouldn't,

1286
00:42:57,621 --> 00:42:58,550
where birth control.

1287
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:00,990
Yeah.

1288
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:01,823
I think you're right.

1289
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,960
Totally makes sense.

1290
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:05,551
These guys,

1291
00:43:05,551 --> 00:43:06,120
um,

1292
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,800
it's almost like they
can't help themselves.

1293
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:08,843
Have you noticed that?

1294
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:10,920
It's almost like no matter
what you talk about,

1295
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:11,880
they just have a story.

1296
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:12,803
It just comes out.

1297
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,290
All right.

1298
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:13,411
Well,

1299
00:43:13,411 --> 00:43:15,210
the ones that are telling
like a lot of stories,

1300
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,830
that's why you know,

1301
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:17,520
it's always,

1302
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,080
they don't just see one thing.

1303
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:19,351
Oh,

1304
00:43:19,351 --> 00:43:21,150
they've seen chew Bekaa Bros,

1305
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,230
they've seen nessie.

1306
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,520
They were on vacation in Scotland.

1307
00:43:23,521 --> 00:43:24,890
We saw nessie triple dog,

1308
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,231
dare you.

1309
00:43:25,231 --> 00:43:26,220
They've seen everything.

1310
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,110
They can't even help themselves.

1311
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:28,700
Oh No,

1312
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,030
thank you.

1313
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:29,450
Thank you.

1314
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,110
Want to tell you a state
want to lie to you?

1315
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:31,411
Well,

1316
00:43:31,411 --> 00:43:31,651
it's,

1317
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:32,010
you know,

1318
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:35,190
I think there's an evolutionary advantage
to it and I think that the moment you

1319
00:43:35,191 --> 00:43:37,460
begin to realize if you're
okay with telling lies,

1320
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:40,710
you start making tons of money and
people will start having sex with you,

1321
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,670
then you could see how there's like a
profound evolutionary advantage to being a

1322
00:43:44,671 --> 00:43:45,420
liar.

1323
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,850
And the ultimate liar is the
liar believes that himself,

1324
00:43:47,851 --> 00:43:50,520
who's told himself the story so
much that he started seeing it.

1325
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,030
There's a huge evolutionary
advantage to this sort of thing.

1326
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:54,570
So I,

1327
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:55,320
I,

1328
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,670
that all being said,

1329
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,950
the real problem here is that
in this sea of horny liars,

1330
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,460
there's a few people
who've seen something real.

1331
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,553
You think?

1332
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,060
Yes.

1333
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:07,421
Okay.

1334
00:44:07,421 --> 00:44:12,421
If you had to put all your
eggs in a basket and pick D,

1335
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:13,990
I'm going to give you three subjects,

1336
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,830
ghosts,

1337
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,540
big foot and aliens.

1338
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,613
Okay.

1339
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,140
What are those?

1340
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,950
Which one of those do you think that
anybody has ever seen a re had a real

1341
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:24,821
experience,

1342
00:44:24,821 --> 00:44:28,500
a real experience or actually
something actually happened?

1343
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:32,100
I think people have seen hyper dimensional

1344
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,993
entities,

1345
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:34,343
uh,

1346
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,380
that could be classified
as ghosts or aliens.

1347
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,110
Do you think that they've
seen these while sober?

1348
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:41,363
No.

1349
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:44,730
That's the problem though,

1350
00:44:44,731 --> 00:44:45,564
isn't it?

1351
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:50,660
There's a variety of chemicals that
radically affect the way you see reality.

1352
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:56,390
And so the real problem is do we just
set as a standard the level of chemicals

1353
00:44:57,241 --> 00:45:01,170
that exists in a normal human
being without any outside help?

1354
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:04,070
And we'll call that like the baseline.

1355
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:04,240
Yeah.

1356
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,640
Do we accept that or tweaked out
of their Gourd on magic mushrooms?

1357
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,290
Because that's also a state
of consciousness a human
can achieve if they consume

1358
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:14,310
the right foods.

1359
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,200
I mean that it really
is what your experience.

1360
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:21,260
So if you under that situation have a
real honest to goodness alien encounter

1361
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:27,060
where you exchange information and
you come out of it a better person,

1362
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:30,030
like in enlightened by the
face of this experience,

1363
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,420
even if it didn't really happen,

1364
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,520
it still happened in your mind.

1365
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:36,150
That's right.

1366
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,460
It's still something you experienced.

1367
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,160
That's right.

1368
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,700
So that could be an entity.

1369
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:41,890
Well

1370
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:46,890
this is why we need a NASA
for psychedelics because
that's when people are

1371
00:45:47,831 --> 00:45:48,580
experiencing these,

1372
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,170
these experiencing these things.

1373
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:51,400
Let's explore it.

1374
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,140
And I think you know a lot of people,

1375
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:53,800
and I,

1376
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,041
you know,

1377
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:55,030
I've done this myself.

1378
00:45:55,031 --> 00:45:58,340
When someone tells you a crazy story of
like what are you high like that does

1379
00:45:58,341 --> 00:45:59,260
credits the person.

1380
00:45:59,261 --> 00:46:04,210
But what if the mind is an antenna and
what of certain chemicals allow you to

1381
00:46:04,211 --> 00:46:07,630
tune in to other frequencies
that exist around us at all time.

1382
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:12,190
And everyone knows that we're surrounded
right now by all kinds of invisible

1383
00:46:12,191 --> 00:46:12,791
frequencies,

1384
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:13,810
ultraviolet light,

1385
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:14,950
radio waves,

1386
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:16,180
wireless signals.

1387
00:46:16,181 --> 00:46:20,650
We are in an ocean of information washing
around is that our computers and our

1388
00:46:20,651 --> 00:46:21,271
technology,

1389
00:46:21,271 --> 00:46:25,900
we're able to translate to digitize and
put it in a form that the human mind can

1390
00:46:25,901 --> 00:46:26,734
understand.

1391
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,690
So in the same way the human mind,

1392
00:46:28,691 --> 00:46:32,980
it's a biocomputer and maybe these
psychedelics create an upgrade to the

1393
00:46:32,981 --> 00:46:37,690
operating system that allows a
temporary window into the unknown.

1394
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:41,560
And when you see that and you come
back to this world and talk about it,

1395
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:45,760
people think you're nuts because you
can't take pictures of something that,

1396
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:46,630
uh,

1397
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:51,630
your mind is seeing after it's gone
into a specific state of intoxication.

1398
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,570
You can only take
pictures by describing it.

1399
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:56,800
Now also,

1400
00:46:56,801 --> 00:47:00,160
if you believe that psychedelics can
rewire the mind to allow us to see the,

1401
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:01,180
uh,

1402
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:05,650
the invisible world that
exists around us at all times,

1403
00:47:05,651 --> 00:47:07,870
then maybe people who are a little crazy,

1404
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:14,010
these things poking out from
behind the lattice of reality.

1405
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:19,170
Maybe they do see it in the same way
that when a person who isn't crazy,

1406
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,290
for lack of a better word,

1407
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:21,430
take psychedelics.

1408
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:22,600
So in that way,

1409
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:27,780
perhaps the lens of our perception
when it's altered in some way,

1410
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:30,100
whether because you're a little on

1411
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,550
the naughty side or because
you've taken some mushrooms,

1412
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,530
maybe when that Lens has shifted,

1413
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:38,260
it allows us to see so much more.

1414
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:39,581
Yeah,

1415
00:47:39,581 --> 00:47:40,990
that's very possible.

1416
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:46,080
It's very possible that that's exactly
what's happening in this area in Utah as

1417
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:46,930
well,

1418
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:47,980
because this area,

1419
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:52,990
besides having this one spot where
everybody claims all these events are

1420
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:53,800
happening,

1421
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,650
you know what else it
has around their cattle,

1422
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:59,380
cattle all over the place.

1423
00:47:59,381 --> 00:48:00,640
The guy had a cattle ranch,

1424
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:01,690
this cat,

1425
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:05,260
we drove past several ranches where
this cattle and with his cattle,

1426
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,460
this cow shit.

1427
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,060
Yep.

1428
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:07,801
And with his cow shit.

1429
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,250
In a place where it rains all the time,

1430
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,833
there's a party,

1431
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:11,943
there's a party.

1432
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:15,850
You're going to get some magic mushrooms
growing in the cow shit and a if that's

1433
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:16,341
all you're doing,

1434
00:48:16,341 --> 00:48:19,840
you're just hanging out in the middle
of nowhere in Utah eating mushrooms,

1435
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:21,550
staring at the rocks,

1436
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,570
you're going to see some shit.

1437
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:22,841
Look,

1438
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:23,140
man,

1439
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,430
I've told you this story before.

1440
00:48:24,431 --> 00:48:25,360
I've eaten my shrimps.

1441
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:26,690
I've been attacked by elves.

1442
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:29,020
I've seen hyper dimensional entities.

1443
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:31,600
I was on mushrooms and I saw it.

1444
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:33,940
I'm not going to go around
saying that Elvis or rail,

1445
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:34,983
but I'll tell you,

1446
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:39,640
when I was laying on that lawn chair
at the spa with Elf swimming through my

1447
00:48:39,641 --> 00:48:41,290
body and making fun of my thoughts,

1448
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:43,240
it seemed very real.

1449
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,460
And it didn't seem fun at all.

1450
00:48:45,461 --> 00:48:47,410
It was an unfunded,

1451
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:49,180
terrifying experience.

1452
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,020
And,

1453
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:50,853
um,

1454
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:54,490
if I'd lived 200 years ago and had just
been forging for food and happened to

1455
00:48:54,491 --> 00:48:57,220
eat some food and that
had that experience,

1456
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,840
I would go back to the village and say,

1457
00:48:58,841 --> 00:49:00,720
they're Elvis in the woods there.

1458
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,211
Elves,

1459
00:49:01,211 --> 00:49:02,590
they swim through your body.

1460
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:04,180
They make fun of your thoughts.

1461
00:49:04,181 --> 00:49:05,014
They're magic.

1462
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:05,950
They're magic.

1463
00:49:05,951 --> 00:49:06,250
They,

1464
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,140
and so I think that,

1465
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:08,860
uh,

1466
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:11,170
psychedelics are a component,

1467
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:11,920
uh,

1468
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,610
in the sick and the experiences
that people have of this nature.

1469
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:18,250
But I don't think that that
means that the experience that,

1470
00:49:18,251 --> 00:49:20,260
I don't think that
invalidates the experience.

1471
00:49:20,261 --> 00:49:20,411
Well,

1472
00:49:20,411 --> 00:49:25,411
it's also brings into account the
fact that the brain itself produces

1473
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:26,500
psychedelic chemicals.

1474
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:27,010
Yes.

1475
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:28,600
Without any help whatsoever.

1476
00:49:28,601 --> 00:49:31,960
The brain produces
dimethyltryptamine five methoxy,

1477
00:49:31,961 --> 00:49:33,010
dimethyltryptamine,

1478
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:33,941
dopamine,

1479
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:34,810
serotonin.

1480
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,730
There's a lot of shit
going on in that brain.

1481
00:49:36,731 --> 00:49:37,564
Melatonin,

1482
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:41,770
your brain is producing all of these
chemicals and they come out and varying

1483
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:42,490
amounts,

1484
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:47,230
just like we have varying dick sizes and
some people have shitty I side and this

1485
00:49:47,231 --> 00:49:48,790
guy was born with a bad liver.

1486
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:49,571
Guess what?

1487
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:53,290
Some people also get indogenous dumps
of psychedelic chemicals they can't

1488
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:54,010
control.

1489
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:55,630
And so they start seeing things.

1490
00:49:55,631 --> 00:49:56,020
Yes,

1491
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,420
and this is something that's
very difficult to measure.

1492
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:02,050
They've just recently figured out how
to measure the pineal gland of rats to

1493
00:50:02,051 --> 00:50:05,650
prove that the pineal gland itself
is a source of dimethyltryptamine.

1494
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,380
Until really recently
it was just a theory.

1495
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:09,880
So now they know that for sure,

1496
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:10,630
but the way they had to do,

1497
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:12,190
they had to cut open
the head of a live rat.

1498
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:12,761
You know,

1499
00:50:12,761 --> 00:50:13,594
you're not going to let up.

1500
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,370
No one's going to let a
person do that to them.

1501
00:50:15,371 --> 00:50:18,850
So we're not even going to find out what
what's going on inside a person's head.

1502
00:50:18,851 --> 00:50:19,880
As far as the consultant,

1503
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,160
the production of this stuff.

1504
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,190
And we certainly are not gonna be able
to figure out when it's active and when

1505
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:24,890
it's not.

1506
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:26,440
These big rushes in bursts.

1507
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:28,100
Unless we get more

1508
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:32,840
advanced medical equipment or unless
we can get right to the source of it,

1509
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:35,450
cut open someone's brain while
they're in the middle of an activity,

1510
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:37,280
neither one of those
events is very likely.

1511
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:40,850
So you're not going to be able to tell
whether or not someone who had this crazy

1512
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:45,851
experience just had this rush of naturally
produce psychedelic chemicals that we

1513
00:50:46,431 --> 00:50:48,110
know exist in the brain.

1514
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:48,860
That's it.

1515
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,551
Exactly,

1516
00:50:49,551 --> 00:50:49,821
man.

1517
00:50:49,821 --> 00:50:51,740
And maybe when they have that rush,

1518
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,780
they're actually perceiving something
that is there and some form something that

1519
00:50:56,781 --> 00:51:01,550
exists in the same way radio waves exist
in the same way that ultraviolet rays

1520
00:51:01,551 --> 00:51:02,330
exist.

1521
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:06,890
And we'll never know that until we stop
the prohibition on psychedelics and

1522
00:51:06,891 --> 00:51:08,630
start studying them again.

1523
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,790
But that's probably never going to happen.

1524
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,153
Um,

1525
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,790
the experience was still fun.

1526
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:16,270
You know,

1527
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:21,270
I enjoy going to rural places and the
scenery there was beautiful and uh,

1528
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:27,930
Mike had all those pieces of petrified
wood that he had found in that area.

1529
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,171
Apparently.

1530
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:30,371
He said,

1531
00:51:30,371 --> 00:51:31,540
it's all over the place.

1532
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:34,870
You just find petrified
wood and it's really,

1533
00:51:34,871 --> 00:51:36,130
really super common.

1534
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:37,241
It's just a very,

1535
00:51:37,241 --> 00:51:38,620
it's a very strange place.

1536
00:51:38,621 --> 00:51:38,991
Like it's a,

1537
00:51:38,991 --> 00:51:40,150
it's very beautiful.

1538
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:42,250
And they said there's a
lot of cougars out there.

1539
00:51:42,251 --> 00:51:46,900
They see like not the chicks that are
looking for actions are over 40 is not.

1540
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:47,740
That's not what they meant.

1541
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:48,820
They meant like mountain lions,

1542
00:51:48,821 --> 00:51:51,280
a lot of mount line activity
and one of the women,

1543
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:51,780
the,

1544
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,530
what's her name that took us up there?

1545
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:54,490
Shannon.

1546
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:55,030
Shannon,

1547
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:55,863
right.

1548
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:56,940
That woman Shannon,

1549
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:59,260
while we were walking up
to the top of that bluff,

1550
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,090
she told me she heard a cat.

1551
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:01,941
Yes.

1552
00:52:01,941 --> 00:52:03,700
She said she just didn't want to upset us.

1553
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:04,541
I go,

1554
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:06,020
how do you know that you heard one?

1555
00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:06,281
She goes,

1556
00:52:06,281 --> 00:52:07,510
you can tell what they sound like.

1557
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:07,961
She goes,

1558
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:10,360
but they didn't want to
have anything to do with us,

1559
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,460
so I just didn't want to alarm y'all.

1560
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:12,800
Hmm.

1561
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,181
I was like,

1562
00:52:13,181 --> 00:52:14,320
Jesus Christ,

1563
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:18,070
we're heard a mountain line like
right next to us in the bushes.

1564
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:18,551
And she's like,

1565
00:52:18,551 --> 00:52:18,731
no.

1566
00:52:18,731 --> 00:52:19,840
Where I keep it moving,

1567
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,591
keep it moving.

1568
00:52:20,591 --> 00:52:21,910
It's only nighttime when they hunt.

1569
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,430
You guys have to be
careful with this show,

1570
00:52:24,431 --> 00:52:24,731
man.

1571
00:52:24,731 --> 00:52:25,091
Yeah.

1572
00:52:25,091 --> 00:52:26,150
You're telling me man,

1573
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:29,050
got up and when I send
you to the weird spots,

1574
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:30,063
yeah,

1575
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:30,911
it's bad.

1576
00:52:30,911 --> 00:52:31,744
It's dangerous.

1577
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:32,441
Look,

1578
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:37,441
we're up in Cougar country who is
guiding us captain crazy phase.

1579
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:38,350
Yeah.

1580
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:43,160
Were guided through herds
of cougars by a lunatic.

1581
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:44,743
This is afraid of,

1582
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:46,720
what was the bulletproof Wolf Wrangler?

1583
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:49,990
The orb color.

1584
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:51,790
You know the horse whisperer.

1585
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,350
He's the Sasquatch whisper.

1586
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:54,850
Either Sasquatch was Burke.

1587
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:55,520
It's,

1588
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,380
I think it's,

1589
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:56,880
uh,

1590
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,200
if only founding bigfoot
knew about this guy.

1591
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:00,250
You know,

1592
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,530
if we knew about this guy and
when we were looking for big foot,

1593
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:04,090
we would've saved a lot of time.

1594
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:04,420
Yup.

1595
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:04,641
To me,

1596
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:06,140
the guy's just a magnet for the stuff.

1597
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,271
Bring him out there,

1598
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:08,290
hanging from a tree,

1599
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:09,733
like bait.

1600
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:11,980
But when we're around man,

1601
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:12,700
even,

1602
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:13,240
you know,

1603
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,430
even though he's a magnet
for paranormal activity,

1604
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,273
when we're around,

1605
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,750
we just were such losers that
we just jinxed it for him.

1606
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:20,171
Well,

1607
00:53:20,171 --> 00:53:21,190
that's what he thinks.

1608
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,100
That's what he thinks probably.

1609
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:24,640
Yeah.

1610
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,480
I wonder if he some stuff while
we were all out there together,

1611
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,850
but he didn't want to bring it up unless
we brought her up cause he wasn't sure

1612
00:53:29,851 --> 00:53:30,684
if it was real.

1613
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:33,300
Do you guys see my grandmother?

1614
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:34,643
No.

1615
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:34,951
Good.

1616
00:53:34,951 --> 00:53:35,784
Just checking.

1617
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:36,220
Yeah,

1618
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,140
I didn't really,

1619
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:39,000
that's not Abraham Lincoln.

1620
00:53:39,001 --> 00:53:42,150
They're telling me that I should
blow up the federal building.

1621
00:53:42,151 --> 00:53:45,990
Abraham Lincoln dressed up like the
silver surfer with a swim cap on

1622
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:49,471
the,

1623
00:53:49,471 --> 00:53:49,681
uh,

1624
00:53:49,681 --> 00:53:51,360
the area was beautiful though.

1625
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:52,001
You know,

1626
00:53:52,001 --> 00:53:52,711
it's the,

1627
00:53:52,711 --> 00:53:52,831
uh,

1628
00:53:52,831 --> 00:53:55,110
the ranch itself when we
were overlooking the ranch.

1629
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:55,771
Gorgeous.

1630
00:53:55,771 --> 00:53:57,000
I would love to have a ranch like that.

1631
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:58,050
It looks so bad ass,

1632
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:02,580
you know that a ranch house and
beautiful trees and the beautiful field.

1633
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:07,780
I think that's the real gift that hunting
for the paranormal gives you is it

1634
00:54:08,241 --> 00:54:09,560
gets you out in the nature.

1635
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:10,341
Yeah.

1636
00:54:10,341 --> 00:54:11,570
It's one beautiful thing about it,

1637
00:54:11,571 --> 00:54:11,751
man.

1638
00:54:11,751 --> 00:54:16,751
This thing takes recluses out of their
basement and endo nature to you go going

1639
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:18,080
for ghosts.

1640
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:19,430
That one sex.

1641
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:20,330
Yeah,

1642
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:21,380
indoor goes tiny,

1643
00:54:21,381 --> 00:54:24,830
but still at least you're driving to
other houses and a lot of people go to

1644
00:54:24,831 --> 00:54:27,860
cemeteries and go outside
to look for ghosts.

1645
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,060
This is nice man,

1646
00:54:29,061 --> 00:54:34,061
because people who otherwise would just
be sitting and moldering piles of old

1647
00:54:34,101 --> 00:54:34,934
diapers,

1648
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:40,060
spraying d odor in the air to cover the
stench of rotting cat that died three

1649
00:54:40,731 --> 00:54:41,391
weeks ago,

1650
00:54:41,391 --> 00:54:45,590
or they stare in the Internet
conspiracy theory websites.

1651
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:50,740
This gets them out into nature and I
think that's a beautiful thing about it.

1652
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:51,731
It is,

1653
00:54:51,731 --> 00:54:52,450
and you know what?

1654
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:53,890
In normally in nature,

1655
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:54,970
just wandering around,

1656
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,740
they'd probably start getting depressed.

1657
00:54:56,741 --> 00:54:57,360
It pros nothing.

1658
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,420
What am I doing with my life?

1659
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:02,380
But when you're running for
your life inside of a graveyard,

1660
00:55:02,381 --> 00:55:04,510
because you know a ghost is chasing you,

1661
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:08,170
it makes things way more interesting
and way more engineers you a spark of

1662
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:08,920
excitement.

1663
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,380
You in fact live the exact same life.

1664
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:15,640
Even if you imagined that this would
be happening if you pretended that this

1665
00:55:15,641 --> 00:55:17,830
would be happening and convinced yourself,

1666
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:21,610
you would live the exact same life as if
an actual ghost was really chasing you.

1667
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,080
So you're goofy,

1668
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:25,570
shitty brain decides this,

1669
00:55:25,571 --> 00:55:28,010
throw some chemicals down the hatch it.

1670
00:55:28,011 --> 00:55:28,280
Listen,

1671
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,770
this guy's barely hanging on,

1672
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,200
let's reward and what a
little of the good stuff.

1673
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:38,040
So they opens up some valve in your brain
and psychedelic chemicals flow and you

1674
00:55:38,081 --> 00:55:41,920
know all the sudden your shitty life
that you're like barely hanging on and

1675
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,830
really thinking hard about
jumping in front of a train.

1676
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,160
Yeah.

1677
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:49,480
All of a sudden it's transformed and like
you are the one who's been haunted by

1678
00:55:49,481 --> 00:55:51,480
Richard the eighth from another dimension.

1679
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,650
He comes out of the ground with
a fucking Turkey leg in his hand.

1680
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:56,070
He was chasing you around the,

1681
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:57,580
hey,

1682
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:58,413
it's gray.

1683
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,080
Why not?

1684
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,150
It's better than his real
life is real life sucks.

1685
00:56:01,151 --> 00:56:01,984
The fat one.

1686
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:02,740
Yeah man.

1687
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:02,891
Well,

1688
00:56:02,891 --> 00:56:03,190
I mean,

1689
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:03,760
right.

1690
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,760
This is the eternal problem is do we
embrace the fantasma on the invisible to

1691
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:11,770
make our white,

1692
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:17,340
our lives glow with the light of lies
or do we just deal with the fact that we

1693
00:56:18,461 --> 00:56:19,420
exist in an end,

1694
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:23,830
permanent part of the time space
continuum and in a matter of a few

1695
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:29,100
cosmic blinks are atoms are going to go
spraying a part into infinity and we're

1696
00:56:29,501 --> 00:56:30,700
going to be worm food.

1697
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,700
That's a hard thing for a
lot of people to digest.

1698
00:56:33,701 --> 00:56:37,930
So maybe they create these mythologies
to come for them a little bit.

1699
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,250
But all that being said,

1700
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:44,740
I think that there's some people who
may be actually have contact with this

1701
00:56:44,741 --> 00:56:48,760
stuff just because crazy people
believe it doesn't mean it's not real.

1702
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,090
It's like that old saying
just because what does,

1703
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:52,511
how does it go?

1704
00:56:52,511 --> 00:56:55,570
Just because you're paranoid doesn't
mean people aren't following you.

1705
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:58,090
Well just cause you're crazy.

1706
00:56:58,091 --> 00:57:00,340
It doesn't mean that there's
no big foot out there.

1707
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,000
It's true.

1708
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,890
So we can't just say because the sources
of all seem to have a burnt antenna,

1709
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:10,330
it doesn't necessarily mean that
the phenomena doesn't exist.

1710
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,620
Let me ask you this.

1711
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:16,740
Have you experienced any blow back for
your willingness to engage in any of

1712
00:57:17,141 --> 00:57:18,040
these ideas,

1713
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:23,140
whether it's Ufo shows or big foot
or anything spectacular like that?

1714
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:27,970
And I think paranormal and anything out
of the realm of normal everyday life.

1715
00:57:27,971 --> 00:57:30,910
Have you experienced
any blow back blowback?

1716
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:31,281
Yeah.

1717
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:35,380
Is there any people like people like
judging you for being a Wacko conspiracy

1718
00:57:35,381 --> 00:57:37,390
theorist and talking about Harper,

1719
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:38,343
Kevin trails?

1720
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:39,131
Not at all.

1721
00:57:39,131 --> 00:57:40,810
Everybody thinks I'm a very rational,

1722
00:57:40,811 --> 00:57:41,770
logical person.

1723
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,720
I think a lot of people
think I'm a scientist.

1724
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:47,380
I actually nominated for a Nobel prize.

1725
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:50,920
I believe my research is bulletproof.

1726
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:55,751
No,

1727
00:57:55,751 --> 00:57:56,740
I mean I honestly,

1728
00:57:56,741 --> 00:58:00,670
I have not gotten very much condescension
because I hang out with you.

1729
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:00,941
I mean,

1730
00:58:00,941 --> 00:58:01,940
look man,

1731
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:04,150
I don't get a lot of that judgment,

1732
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,430
but um,

1733
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,900
I think actually it's
the other way around.

1734
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:12,160
I think you tend to get more judgment
from people when you're a skeptic than you

1735
00:58:12,161 --> 00:58:13,120
do if you're a believer.

1736
00:58:13,121 --> 00:58:15,580
I think skeptics take a lot of heat,

1737
00:58:15,581 --> 00:58:16,030
man.

1738
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:16,361
You know,

1739
00:58:16,361 --> 00:58:21,280
I took more heat from the chem trail
episode than anything else I've ever done

1740
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:22,180
on Twitter.

1741
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:26,440
More people were upset at me because they
believe that I'm like contributing to

1742
00:58:26,441 --> 00:58:31,240
Geo engineering by the elites at the
global elites are mixing aluminum in the

1743
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:35,380
jet fuel and using it to
control the population like Ooh,

1744
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:39,670
that it's actually Nano particles in
the chem trails that they're heating up

1745
00:58:39,671 --> 00:58:42,400
with harp and they using that
to control the population.

1746
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,240
Like Golly,

1747
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:46,600
a certain point in time you just go,

1748
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:47,560
wow,

1749
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:48,910
what am I doing?

1750
00:58:48,911 --> 00:58:50,680
Even communicating with you fuck heads.

1751
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:50,921
Well,

1752
00:58:50,921 --> 00:58:54,760
I love the idea of following
that all the way through.

1753
00:58:54,761 --> 00:58:58,330
So this is what I like to imagine as the
meeting where you're in an underground

1754
00:58:58,331 --> 00:59:00,430
laboratory surrounded by
federal agents are like,

1755
00:59:00,431 --> 00:59:01,264
listen Joe,

1756
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:04,240
I think that they're catching on that
we're spraying aluminum into their

1757
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:05,080
playgrounds.

1758
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:06,520
You're a charismatic guy.

1759
00:59:06,521 --> 00:59:07,151
Can you do this?

1760
00:59:07,151 --> 00:59:10,330
Show calm everything down a little bit.

1761
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,620
What do you want an island?

1762
00:59:11,621 --> 00:59:12,490
We'll give you an island,

1763
00:59:12,491 --> 00:59:13,271
a mortal life,

1764
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:13,931
and by the way,

1765
00:59:13,931 --> 00:59:14,231
look,

1766
00:59:14,231 --> 00:59:15,460
I can turn into a lizard

1767
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:22,160
and they send you back into the world
to do a show in the Psi Phi network.

1768
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,290
That's their answer to,

1769
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:23,710
to the

1770
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:24,141
problem.

1771
00:59:24,141 --> 00:59:24,321
Yeah.

1772
00:59:24,321 --> 00:59:25,400
That's how you can show the problem.

1773
00:59:25,401 --> 00:59:29,060
You get dirty comedians who also double
as cage fighting commentators and you

1774
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:33,020
have them disseminate the information
because everybody knows they are so

1775
00:59:33,021 --> 00:59:33,980
reliable,

1776
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,510
accurate with their,

1777
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,040
their view of the world.

1778
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:37,311
Well,

1779
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:38,870
it's not like he's fucked up at all.

1780
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:39,141
Well,

1781
00:59:39,141 --> 00:59:39,441
it's no,

1782
00:59:39,441 --> 00:59:41,570
it's not like the guy's
a marijuana advocate.

1783
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:42,560
Hey listen,

1784
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,490
we need to convince these conspiracy
theorists that there is an actually Kim

1785
00:59:46,491 --> 00:59:51,050
trails gimme that guy with a DMT molecule
tattooed on his arm and the other guy

1786
00:59:51,051 --> 00:59:53,660
has got that youtube video
of him projectile vomiting.

1787
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:57,021
Yeah,

1788
00:59:57,021 --> 00:59:57,321
man,

1789
00:59:57,321 --> 00:59:58,490
it's a grand conspiracy.

1790
00:59:58,880 --> 00:59:59,900
You figured this out,

1791
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:00,921
Dick.

1792
01:00:00,921 --> 01:00:02,450
Fuck 79 on Twitter.

1793
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,760
He's silly bitch.

1794
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:05,510
Yeah,

1795
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:05,870
there's,

1796
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:10,280
there's no getting around the fact
that because of the Internet you get to

1797
01:00:10,281 --> 01:00:15,170
communicate with a lot of people
that you wouldn't ordinarily,

1798
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:18,290
there's people that you would gravitate
towards and you find them as well,

1799
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:21,980
but there's also people that somehow or
another show up at the party and you're

1800
01:00:21,981 --> 01:00:22,190
like,

1801
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:23,360
Oh God,

1802
01:00:23,361 --> 01:00:24,830
what is this?

1803
01:00:24,831 --> 01:00:26,090
And you're going to
have to deal with that.

1804
01:00:26,091 --> 01:00:29,930
That's part of the whole openness of the
complete experience of the Internet is

1805
01:00:29,931 --> 01:00:32,530
that you are going to have to deal
with that part of the part of the pro

1806
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:33,031
blow harder,

1807
01:00:33,031 --> 01:00:33,864
the fun man and,

1808
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,130
but I again,

1809
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:40,160
that's why I think that you have to hold
people with extraordinary claims even

1810
01:00:40,771 --> 01:00:45,771
more to the fire of logic and truth
than other people because it's because

1811
01:00:46,411 --> 01:00:47,130
you've got it.

1812
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:51,210
I really believe that there is a,

1813
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,070
for lack of a better word,

1814
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,690
a supernatural realm.

1815
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:59,900
There is something outside
human perception that is
populated that is possibly

1816
01:01:01,141 --> 01:01:05,130
populated with a sentient
beings that aren't embodied.

1817
01:01:05,131 --> 01:01:06,450
I think that that's possible.

1818
01:01:06,451 --> 01:01:08,640
It's been reported in every religion,

1819
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:09,930
every mythology.

1820
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,350
It's a story that keeps coming
up again and again and again.

1821
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:14,410
Everything.

1822
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:16,060
Your own personal experiences.

1823
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:16,930
Yes.

1824
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:19,210
So having had these personal experiences,

1825
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:21,200
it's something that you,

1826
01:01:21,201 --> 01:01:21,480
you,

1827
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,920
you not only except it yourself,

1828
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:27,040
but you feel compelled to
tell other people about it.

1829
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:27,840
Yes,

1830
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:32,840
and the history of humanity is one where
humans are being led by an invisible

1831
01:01:33,961 --> 01:01:34,620
being.

1832
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:38,370
The world religions have
controlled society for a long,

1833
01:01:38,371 --> 01:01:39,204
long time.

1834
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:43,380
And these world religions all have
at their root outside of Buddhism,

1835
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:48,620
the notion of an invisible entity
that as an interest in guiding humans.

1836
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:54,410
And so this is not just some
imaginary thing in the sense that,

1837
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:55,710
uh,

1838
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:59,550
that it's something that people
talk about who also huff glue.

1839
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:04,880
This is something that's been controlling
the flow of history for thousands of

1840
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:06,030
years.

1841
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:10,650
So I think that it's very important
to try to get to the truth of it.

1842
01:02:10,651 --> 01:02:11,310
What's the core?

1843
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,270
Is it just the brain?

1844
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:15,240
Is the brain just some
drug dealer or our brains?

1845
01:02:15,241 --> 01:02:20,070
Just a grateful dead parking lot that
from time to time spray hallucinogenics

1846
01:02:20,071 --> 01:02:20,904
into us.

1847
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:25,650
The back of the bus explodes and acid
flies through the air like confetti and

1848
01:02:25,651 --> 01:02:27,030
everybody just sticks her tongue out.

1849
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:27,541
Yeah.

1850
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:30,120
Is that what it is or is in,

1851
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:30,990
is that all it is?

1852
01:02:30,991 --> 01:02:34,950
Is it just that the neurons in our
brain misfire a little bit like a,

1853
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:39,330
like a electrical cable in a puddle
and it causes it to see these entities?

1854
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:44,360
Or is there another universe that exists
that we can see if we learn to control

1855
01:02:45,811 --> 01:02:49,230
our minds and our consciousness and I
think it's important to explore those

1856
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:50,064
ideas.

1857
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:55,070
I think also that our life in
this dimension of conscious
reality is filled with

1858
01:02:55,711 --> 01:03:00,711
so much uncertainty and so much confusion
and we have such a inclination to

1859
01:03:01,591 --> 01:03:02,790
follow others,

1860
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:07,890
to follow smarter people than us to
follow the leader too because we're all

1861
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:11,070
basically terrified of what we're doing.

1862
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:16,220
We're all going through life be barely
hanging on because you don't really want

1863
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:19,140
to think about the entirety of
it all because it's too much.

1864
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:23,010
I just got to get to the
work by x time and you know,

1865
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,740
I punch out at six and then
I'm going to go do this.

1866
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:26,730
Like that's,

1867
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:31,760
that's filling your time and it's not
by any small coincidence that that's

1868
01:03:31,831 --> 01:03:32,670
filling your time.

1869
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,190
It's because if the,

1870
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:35,280
if it wasn't,

1871
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,300
if you really were spending all of
your time contemplating your existence,

1872
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,010
it would almost be overwhelming.

1873
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,720
It would almost be too much for
you to wrap your head around.

1874
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:45,930
And because of that,

1875
01:03:45,931 --> 01:03:50,931
we seek to defined our
universe in very certain terms.

1876
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:52,440
This is real.

1877
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:53,910
That's nonsense.

1878
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:54,510
This,

1879
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:55,710
this is would,

1880
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:56,521
you know,

1881
01:03:56,521 --> 01:03:59,220
there's no elves in space around me.

1882
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:00,240
You don't know what you're talking.

1883
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:02,140
And we were like adamant about our,

1884
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:06,150
our version of reality to the point where
people get upset at you if you want to

1885
01:04:06,151 --> 01:04:08,100
escape this version of reality.

1886
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:08,761
Oh,

1887
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:10,440
you looking for a way out.

1888
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:11,471
Are you scared?

1889
01:04:11,471 --> 01:04:12,301
A reality?

1890
01:04:12,301 --> 01:04:13,770
You can't handle reality.

1891
01:04:13,771 --> 01:04:15,090
You've got to take drugs.

1892
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:17,670
Like people will say that to me
and what are they trying to do?

1893
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,730
They're terrified of other
people escaping reality too.

1894
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:22,920
They're terrified of reality.

1895
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:26,580
They're terrified of different definitions
that they have could have to consider

1896
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:27,730
of reality.

1897
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:28,470
Everyone is,

1898
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:29,580
it's not something we address,

1899
01:04:29,581 --> 01:04:30,840
but it is subconscious.

1900
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:32,010
It is there all the time.

1901
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:32,311
Yup.

1902
01:04:32,311 --> 01:04:32,520
Yup.

1903
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,001
It's true,

1904
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:33,331
man.

1905
01:04:33,331 --> 01:04:33,571
And,

1906
01:04:33,571 --> 01:04:33,841
and I,

1907
01:04:33,841 --> 01:04:38,841
and I think that the impulse
behind skeptics is of,

1908
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:39,461
is a,

1909
01:04:39,461 --> 01:04:40,620
is a great impulse.

1910
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,020
It's an impulse that changes
the world for the better.

1911
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:44,370
When I don't,

1912
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,151
I don't know who,

1913
01:04:45,151 --> 01:04:45,690
uh,

1914
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:50,280
was the first person to say that there
are diseases were called caused by germs.

1915
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:51,330
I wish I did.

1916
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,230
But,

1917
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:53,063
um,

1918
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:56,460
if that person who
started figuring out that,

1919
01:04:56,461 --> 01:04:56,641
oh,

1920
01:04:56,641 --> 01:05:00,180
I think there's invisible entities that
crawl into our body and make us sick.

1921
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:04,590
If that person hadn't explored
that in a scientific way,

1922
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:08,910
then who knows what could
have happened to humanity.

1923
01:05:08,911 --> 01:05:09,360
You know,

1924
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,193
we all the,

1925
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:13,470
all the different cures and
antibiotics that we have,

1926
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:14,760
that wouldn't have happened.

1927
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:16,170
I mean eventually it would have happened.

1928
01:05:16,171 --> 01:05:17,350
But if somebody,

1929
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:19,150
you had that initial impulse,

1930
01:05:19,151 --> 01:05:22,570
I think there's invisible creatures that
get as sick when they started saying

1931
01:05:22,571 --> 01:05:24,900
that everyone around them
where they thought they,

1932
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:25,833
they were insane.

1933
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:26,261
You know,

1934
01:05:26,261 --> 01:05:27,100
the story of the,

1935
01:05:27,101 --> 01:05:27,880
um,

1936
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,211
uh,

1937
01:05:28,211 --> 01:05:31,300
I can't remember the name as a doctor
who ended up in an insane asylum,

1938
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:35,950
but cause he started suggesting that
doctors wash their hands before they

1939
01:05:35,951 --> 01:05:36,850
deliver babies.

1940
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,220
He would say if you're touching a corpse,

1941
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:42,070
wash your hands and then deliver the baby.

1942
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:44,500
And doctors at the time said,

1943
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:45,551
gentlemen,

1944
01:05:45,551 --> 01:05:49,840
have no need to wash their hands because
they didn't know that there was viruses

1945
01:05:49,841 --> 01:05:50,710
and bacteria,

1946
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:51,341
uh,

1947
01:05:51,341 --> 01:05:53,500
existing in the world because
it hadn't been proven.

1948
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:58,090
So this guy who came up with this
idea that doctors or wash their hands,

1949
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,680
he ended up in a mental asylum.

1950
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:02,470
He went crazy because
he knew this was real.

1951
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:05,590
He went insane because he knew that there
was something called germs and nobody

1952
01:06:05,591 --> 01:06:06,760
believed in it at the time.

1953
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:08,740
So that's the,

1954
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:10,210
that's the great problem.

1955
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:12,910
All the people out there
bugling about Ufos,

1956
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,110
bugling about,

1957
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:15,040
uh,

1958
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:19,990
wormholes and big foot and missed wolf's.

1959
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:25,380
They have to let skeptics interrogate
them in the most intense way,

1960
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:28,390
not to disprove them or
show that they're crazy,

1961
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:30,280
but to get to the core truth.

1962
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:33,400
And sometimes the core
truth is just theirs.

1963
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:36,070
They're the only one who were
really have access to it.

1964
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:40,840
And if it was some sort of a hallucination
or whether it was real to them,

1965
01:06:40,841 --> 01:06:44,710
but we can't perceive it because we
weren't tuned into whatever frequency and

1966
01:06:44,711 --> 01:06:47,890
radio dial of the universe that they
were at the time that it happened.

1967
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:53,220
The bottom line is you got to bring
something back in order for me to take it

1968
01:06:54,221 --> 01:06:55,180
totally seriously.

1969
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,740
I'm listening.

1970
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:57,753
I'll listen.

1971
01:06:57,970 --> 01:07:00,400
I'll try to put myself in your footsteps.

1972
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:04,930
I'll try to put my myself in your head
and try to figure out what you possibly

1973
01:07:04,931 --> 01:07:05,950
could have been experiencing,

1974
01:07:05,951 --> 01:07:07,090
why it was all going down,

1975
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:08,500
but unless it's happening to me,

1976
01:07:08,501 --> 01:07:09,640
it's all just nonsense.

1977
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:11,583
You know,

1978
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:12,591
and that's,

1979
01:07:12,591 --> 01:07:16,420
that's a a real part of the reality
that these folks are experiencing and it

1980
01:07:16,421 --> 01:07:17,080
should be.

1981
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:17,913
It has to be,

1982
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:18,341
you know,

1983
01:07:18,341 --> 01:07:18,581
less.

1984
01:07:18,581 --> 01:07:19,750
I can experience it myself.

1985
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:23,920
There's nothing that I've seen
that compels me to believe anybody.

1986
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:29,070
This is nothing I've seen that compels
me that this is an actual UFO landing

1987
01:07:29,441 --> 01:07:29,771
side,

1988
01:07:29,771 --> 01:07:31,950
that this is a guy who's
been a board of space ship,

1989
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,030
that this is someone who's been abducted.

1990
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:38,050
Apparently there's some people that tell
me that they're going to tell me the

1991
01:07:38,051 --> 01:07:41,350
story of what happened to them
and I'm going to believe it.

1992
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:42,610
And you're going to meet one of them.

1993
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:46,600
You're going to meet this woman named
Nicole Dome and you're going to sit down

1994
01:07:46,601 --> 01:07:47,290
with her.

1995
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:52,290
And she apparently has some sort of an
alien implant that she claims she got

1996
01:07:53,171 --> 01:07:53,921
inside of her body.

1997
01:07:53,921 --> 01:07:54,850
I don't know the full story,

1998
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:55,751
but a,

1999
01:07:55,751 --> 01:07:57,340
you're going to learn it and uh,

2000
01:07:57,341 --> 01:07:58,660
I figured it'd be perfect for you.

2001
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,070
That's your type of person.

2002
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:00,431
Yeah.

2003
01:08:00,431 --> 01:08:02,260
This sounds like an eharmony date for me.

2004
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:03,490
Freaky tattooed up.

2005
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,010
Very pretty girl who's
been abducted by aliens.

2006
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,330
It's my cell mate.

2007
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,140
That's it.

2008
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:10,480
You're on your other path is exciting.

2009
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:15,220
I've never met a person that
has been abducted by aliens.

2010
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:18,890
I'm at a couple of people that told
me they were abducted by aliens,

2011
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:21,020
but I'm pretty sure
they were bullshitting.

2012
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:25,340
Like I've never met one person
who had a story that I was like,

2013
01:08:25,341 --> 01:08:26,060
wow,

2014
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:26,970
that this,

2015
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:27,710
this um,

2016
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:28,730
this seems to be real.

2017
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:29,960
Um,

2018
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,880
but I'm told that,

2019
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:32,090
uh,

2020
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:32,661
there's a woman,

2021
01:08:32,661 --> 01:08:34,730
her name is Nicole and
you're gonna meet her.

2022
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:40,120
And this woman apparently
has an incredibly believable,

2023
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:41,660
compelling story.

2024
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:44,690
And people that have
talked to her have said,

2025
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:45,201
you know,

2026
01:08:45,201 --> 01:08:45,740
wow.

2027
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,090
Like you walk away from it and you go,

2028
01:08:47,091 --> 01:08:47,924
I believe her.

2029
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:50,000
I don't know.

2030
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:50,421
And I,

2031
01:08:50,421 --> 01:08:52,730
but I trust your judgment and uh,

2032
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:53,623
it's,

2033
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:54,530
she's right up your alley.

2034
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:55,910
She's really hot.

2035
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:59,090
Freaky look in covered in tattoos and uh,

2036
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,500
she's been a borders Ufo.

2037
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,640
So mean.

2038
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:02,600
This is my soulmate.

2039
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:03,290
Your soulmate.

2040
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:04,250
That's amazing.

2041
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:07,790
So go meet her and talk
to her and you know,

2042
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:08,683
tell us what's up.

2043
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:10,713
I'm there.

2044
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:11,890
E harmony date.

2045
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:13,683
Okay.

2046
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,100
Tell me about Nicole dome.

2047
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,033
Wow,

2048
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:19,270
you're right.

2049
01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:20,350
She's a beautiful woman.

2050
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:21,663
Uh,

2051
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,111
tattoos,

2052
01:09:23,111 --> 01:09:24,340
interesting tattoos.

2053
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:25,503
Um,

2054
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:27,340
she seemed very grounded,

2055
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:28,480
focused.

2056
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:29,643
Uh,

2057
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:34,710
she did not seem anything
like captain crazy cake from,

2058
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:36,100
what did you call him?

2059
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:37,270
Captain crazy phase.

2060
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:37,670
He,

2061
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:38,160
she sees,

2062
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,090
she didn't seem anything
like captain crazy face.

2063
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:41,710
She was very focused,

2064
01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:42,783
calm,

2065
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:43,983
open.

2066
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:46,150
She definitely experienced something.

2067
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:46,301
Okay.

2068
01:09:46,301 --> 01:09:47,290
What was her story?

2069
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:51,790
She's leaving a diner with her friend.

2070
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:53,200
They want to go play pool.

2071
01:09:53,201 --> 01:09:54,040
It's late at night.

2072
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:55,330
This is a small town.

2073
01:09:55,510 --> 01:10:00,130
She's driving down the road and
suddenly they witnessed this hexagon,

2074
01:10:00,131 --> 01:10:01,690
a light above the car.

2075
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:03,820
And so she,

2076
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:06,850
they decided to pull over to look at
the light because they're experiencing a

2077
01:10:06,851 --> 01:10:11,200
Ufo and suddenly she's
driving down the road.

2078
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:11,921
Yeah.

2079
01:10:11,921 --> 01:10:14,380
And she's a mile down the road and,

2080
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:15,011
uh,

2081
01:10:15,011 --> 01:10:18,640
she gets to meet her friends at the
pool hall and they're pissed off because

2082
01:10:18,641 --> 01:10:23,020
she's an hour late and she should have
been there in four minutes after leaving

2083
01:10:23,021 --> 01:10:23,854
the cafe.

2084
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:26,470
So she had the type of,

2085
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:27,310
uh,

2086
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:27,551
the,

2087
01:10:27,551 --> 01:10:28,271
what do they call that?

2088
01:10:28,271 --> 01:10:29,800
The tip not aggression sheet now.

2089
01:10:29,801 --> 01:10:30,700
And I am not a progression.

2090
01:10:30,701 --> 01:10:31,850
She had at time loss,

2091
01:10:31,851 --> 01:10:33,070
she had time loss.

2092
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:34,180
Uh,

2093
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:39,130
and she and her friends seemed
drugged after the experience.

2094
01:10:39,131 --> 01:10:41,170
So that's,

2095
01:10:41,171 --> 01:10:43,000
that's her experience.

2096
01:10:43,001 --> 01:10:44,340
Her friends seemed drugs.

2097
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:44,801
Yes.

2098
01:10:44,801 --> 01:10:48,490
When they were driving down the road
after having decided to stop to look at

2099
01:10:48,491 --> 01:10:49,290
this light,

2100
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:51,940
there are further down the road
with no memory of what's happened.

2101
01:10:51,941 --> 01:10:55,480
They have the typical form of
Amnesia that abductees talk about.

2102
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:57,790
Her friends seems like she's drugged.

2103
01:10:57,970 --> 01:11:02,740
Her friends seem like she's been
anesthetized or given some kind of drug to

2104
01:11:02,741 --> 01:11:03,580
knock her out.

2105
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:04,450
They both,

2106
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:05,890
she's our friends groggy.

2107
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:06,873
I asked if they,

2108
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:09,100
if a friend was drunk
or did they were high?

2109
01:11:09,101 --> 01:11:10,090
She said No.

2110
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:12,400
And where were they coming from?

2111
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:13,890
They were from a diner.

2112
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,860
Is it possible that someone
dosed them in the diner?

2113
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:17,873
Absolutely.

2114
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:18,421
Absolutely.

2115
01:11:18,421 --> 01:11:18,710
Right.

2116
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:22,020
It is possible that they were seen as
much more likely someone was being an

2117
01:11:22,021 --> 01:11:23,970
asshole who's a working in the kitchen,

2118
01:11:23,971 --> 01:11:27,150
decide to slip some LSD into their
cheerio's or whatever the hell they ate,

2119
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:29,270
haven't seen as much more likely.

2120
01:11:29,271 --> 01:11:29,630
Well,

2121
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:30,463
she,

2122
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:31,580
yes,

2123
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:32,241
definitely.

2124
01:11:32,241 --> 01:11:33,230
That's a possibility.

2125
01:11:33,231 --> 01:11:33,860
Now,

2126
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:34,693
uh,

2127
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:39,680
her story is not that she ended up in
somebody's basement tied to a chair on

2128
01:11:39,681 --> 01:11:44,681
Cheerio laden LSD or
Lsd Laden cheerio's she,

2129
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:47,240
her story is that,

2130
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:48,463
um,

2131
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:54,580
psychics started telling her that
something on the left side of her body was

2132
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:56,083
off.

2133
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:57,950
And this happened a couple of times.

2134
01:11:58,250 --> 01:11:58,730
Uh,

2135
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:02,510
and so she went to a UFO convention.

2136
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:03,643
And

2137
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:05,913
Are you looking at me like,

2138
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:08,260
well,

2139
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:09,820
because here's,

2140
01:12:09,821 --> 01:12:10,660
here's my feeling.

2141
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:15,550
You know how I feel about psych techs
and I think you know how I feel about

2142
01:12:15,551 --> 01:12:18,760
people that find out something
really special happened to them.

2143
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:21,490
All those things are very suspect.

2144
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:24,040
The psychic thing is
incredibly suspect to also,

2145
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:29,250
a lot of people are very susceptible to
suggestion and a lot of people are very

2146
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:32,770
susceptible to attractive
girls with tattoos.

2147
01:12:33,730 --> 01:12:34,001
That's,

2148
01:12:34,001 --> 01:12:34,840
you know.

2149
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:35,141
Yeah,

2150
01:12:35,141 --> 01:12:37,330
so I knew you were going to have
a problem with reality here,

2151
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:41,790
whereas if she was a fat guy with three
teeth and she smelled like Heineken,

2152
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:44,373
you,

2153
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:47,470
you'd feel like this guy's an asshole.

2154
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:48,940
He wasn't a border Ufo.

2155
01:12:48,941 --> 01:12:50,140
He's trying to get me to look at it.

2156
01:12:50,141 --> 01:12:51,100
Stomach man.

2157
01:12:51,101 --> 01:12:52,150
It was gross.

2158
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:56,590
He kept lifting up his beer gut asking
me if I had a black light and I'm like,

2159
01:12:56,591 --> 01:12:58,180
this guy's going to try to fuck me.

2160
01:12:58,181 --> 01:12:58,541
I got gotta.

2161
01:12:58,541 --> 01:12:59,380
Get out of here.

2162
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:00,820
That's what you would've said.

2163
01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:05,200
You were hypnotized by the sweet nectar
of youth and the reckless indignation of

2164
01:13:05,201 --> 01:13:06,820
a girl with tattoos on her tits.

2165
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:08,480
That's what happened with you.

2166
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:11,170
You got caught up in the the tsunami.

2167
01:13:11,171 --> 01:13:13,360
That is the sexuality of that woman.

2168
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,710
And you were willing to loan,

2169
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:15,680
Oh yeah,

2170
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:21,650
you want to Skype,

2171
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:25,610
I can see your implants.

2172
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:26,151
I mean,

2173
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:27,350
you know the alien one,

2174
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:32,341
right?

2175
01:13:32,341 --> 01:13:33,121
It's natural.

2176
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:33,954
It's natural.

2177
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:35,370
That's why you know,

2178
01:13:35,371 --> 01:13:40,000
I mean it's empire for
some people it's very know

2179
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:42,790
I'm not gonna argue with you the,

2180
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:46,360
the vehicle telling the UFO story.

2181
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:47,350
If it is a,

2182
01:13:47,351 --> 01:13:51,160
if it happens to be a beautiful young,

2183
01:13:51,161 --> 01:13:53,020
tattooed girl,

2184
01:13:53,021 --> 01:13:53,710
then yes.

2185
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:53,861
I,

2186
01:13:53,861 --> 01:13:54,610
you know what,

2187
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:56,650
my ears are going to perk
up a little bit more.

2188
01:13:56,770 --> 01:14:01,770
But I will say that I've run into a lot
of pretty tattoo girls who seem bat shit

2189
01:14:02,921 --> 01:14:03,610
crazy.

2190
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:05,470
They seem like they've
been staring at the sun,

2191
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:06,170
isn't it?

2192
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:07,530
And Glue who,

2193
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:08,191
you know,

2194
01:14:08,191 --> 01:14:09,120
it's just cause you're right.

2195
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:11,980
So I will say that and you can

2196
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:12,813
review the tape.

2197
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:15,040
I will say that she seemed very centered,

2198
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:16,640
focused her,

2199
01:14:16,641 --> 01:14:18,400
she believed her story.

2200
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:20,040
And um,

2201
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:25,440
the most compelling evidence that she
has is that apparently there is a scar on

2202
01:14:27,611 --> 01:14:29,970
her stomach and that if
you put a black light over,

2203
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:30,823
you can see it.

2204
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,550
It wasn't there when she
showed it to us at the bar.

2205
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:36,460
The problem issues getting this
information from a psychic.

2206
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:38,620
The problem is she's
getting this information,

2207
01:14:38,621 --> 01:14:39,610
not just from a sidekick,

2208
01:14:39,611 --> 01:14:44,260
but someone who says they're a psychic
and almost everyone who says they're a

2209
01:14:44,261 --> 01:14:46,240
psychic is full of shit.

2210
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:48,940
It might be 100% of them,

2211
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:50,770
but it's at least 90 dine.

2212
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:51,250
Okay.

2213
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:55,000
So the odds of her finding the one out
of a hundred that isn't full of shit,

2214
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:57,310
those odds really suck.

2215
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:00,640
So then you have a person
who is a nice person,

2216
01:15:00,641 --> 01:15:02,530
but a person willing to
get tattoos on their tits.

2217
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:03,550
Okay,

2218
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:04,180
she's gay,

2219
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:04,930
she's gangster.

2220
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:06,030
She's willing to take some chances.

2221
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:06,380
Look,

2222
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:07,300
I have tattoos myself.

2223
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,680
She's willing to take some chances.

2224
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:09,071
Okay.

2225
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:09,880
She's wild.

2226
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:10,960
She's willing to go with it.

2227
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:11,950
She's willing to go with it.

2228
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:12,200
Yeah,

2229
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:16,090
we'll want to go with an idea and she
might be willing to go with a memory

2230
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:19,990
that's some crazy fucking fake
psychic plants in her brain.

2231
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,940
And it sounds real.

2232
01:15:21,941 --> 01:15:23,980
And when you convince
yourself a shit like that,

2233
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,510
if you're so inclined,

2234
01:15:25,511 --> 01:15:26,344
especially,

2235
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:31,210
and I believe she probably is so inclined
to believe the fantastic common for

2236
01:15:31,211 --> 01:15:36,211
people who have UFO abduction experiences
to have like an inclination towards

2237
01:15:36,491 --> 01:15:37,510
that type of thing.

2238
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:39,220
They believe in that type of thing,

2239
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:43,420
which aids the experience confirmation
bias and she's only talking about

2240
01:15:43,421 --> 01:15:44,200
memories.

2241
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:44,920
That's right.

2242
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,480
Well here's the provable part.

2243
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:47,770
She has going,

2244
01:15:47,771 --> 01:15:52,771
apparently these beings abducted or the
memories that she has are of being put

2245
01:15:53,861 --> 01:15:58,780
on a steel table and they
did something to our ovaries,

2246
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:01,000
possibly put an implant inside of her.

2247
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:05,830
She's actually going to get tests within
the next few days to see what's going

2248
01:16:05,831 --> 01:16:10,180
on down there and to see if there is some
kind of implant there and also it's an

2249
01:16:10,181 --> 01:16:10,661
Iud.

2250
01:16:10,661 --> 01:16:11,560
She forgot about,

2251
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:14,560
she had an IUD put in when she
was in high school and it's just,

2252
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:15,221
Oh fuck.

2253
01:16:15,221 --> 01:16:16,054
Where'd that thing go?

2254
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:17,050
I look,

2255
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,070
I hear is that

2256
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:20,560
she has no,

2257
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:24,670
she has no evidence right now to prove.

2258
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:26,140
Of course it doesn't have any evidence,

2259
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:28,900
but she's going to get it and
she's not going to happen.

2260
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:30,880
She's not going to happen.

2261
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:31,833
How about that?

2262
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,130
How about hold your breath.

2263
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:36,520
It's never going to appear.

2264
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:37,960
There's going to be no evidence.

2265
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:39,130
It doesn't exist.

2266
01:16:39,131 --> 01:16:40,450
You're never going to find it.

2267
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:43,780
It lives inside the imagination only.

2268
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:45,610
I'm going to scan her with a blacklight.

2269
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:47,920
It might be a real experience now.

2270
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:48,341
Okay.

2271
01:16:48,341 --> 01:16:49,480
As far as memories go,

2272
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:54,660
her memory might be as real as my memories
of some stuff I did just a couple of

2273
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:56,110
weeks ago,

2274
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:58,120
which are very shady at best.

2275
01:16:58,330 --> 01:17:01,990
If you asked me about my trip to the
mall to get my laptop fixed two weeks ago

2276
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,300
and I had to recount
everything that happened.

2277
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:09,590
If you could see inside my memory about
how shitty it really is and little,

2278
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:11,810
I really remember about
my trip to the mall.

2279
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:13,370
I remember almost nothing.

2280
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,010
If you told me I had to pick out
where I was parked or there was,

2281
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:17,780
I couldn't drive home and black shit.

2282
01:17:17,781 --> 01:17:18,710
I Dunno where I parked.

2283
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:23,540
I have no idea where I parked at the mall
two weeks ago and that was me and that

2284
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:25,070
was real while I was awake.

2285
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:30,050
So these memories of this woman has
that are pulled out of a dream state.

2286
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:30,910
Okay.

2287
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:32,630
Pulls out of a hypnotic state.

2288
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:34,850
Suggested to her by a psychic.

2289
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,060
Don't they don't even live
in her conscious memory.

2290
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:42,470
A memory that she's piecing together from
something that someone told her about

2291
01:17:42,471 --> 01:17:44,780
some dreams maybe.

2292
01:17:44,781 --> 01:17:45,240
Yeah,

2293
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:47,540
that might as well me
and my trip to the mall.

2294
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,050
Okay.

2295
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:49,790
Cause so it to her it is real.

2296
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:51,530
So when she's telling you that it's real,

2297
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:52,880
she does feel it's real.

2298
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:54,050
And when she looks down,

2299
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:54,561
first of all,

2300
01:17:54,561 --> 01:17:56,870
why is this freak looking at
herself with black lights?

2301
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:57,301
Well that's,

2302
01:17:57,301 --> 01:17:59,180
this lever looks at
themselves with a black light.

2303
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:00,770
He was at a UFO convention.

2304
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:01,750
Naked.

2305
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:02,570
No liquor.

2306
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:03,261
Your belly button.

2307
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:03,441
No,

2308
01:18:03,441 --> 01:18:06,190
this is the story for Real UFO convention,

2309
01:18:06,210 --> 01:18:09,320
which shows up under black light loads.

2310
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:11,120
They do,

2311
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,560
they show up like ghosts.

2312
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:13,520
This is a cut.

2313
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:17,510
They take you to take your little woman
and have a little party on her upper mid

2314
01:18:17,511 --> 01:18:22,511
section and then then flash if a black
light close the shut the lights off,

2315
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:23,540
close the shades,

2316
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:24,471
use a black light.

2317
01:18:24,471 --> 01:18:24,860
You like,

2318
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:25,251
oh,

2319
01:18:25,251 --> 01:18:26,240
now I get it.

2320
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:26,661
Yeah,

2321
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:27,291
that's a scar,

2322
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:27,800
honey.

2323
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,500
She got caught with a gun shot of load.

2324
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:31,550
That's what it is.

2325
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:34,520
She got caught in the crossfire and
some of it was still stuck on her side.

2326
01:18:34,521 --> 01:18:35,840
Can you please not talk about Nicole?

2327
01:18:35,841 --> 01:18:36,674
I'm sorry.

2328
01:18:36,990 --> 01:18:37,810
It wasn't even really Nicole.

2329
01:18:37,810 --> 01:18:38,420
I'd never met her.

2330
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:39,500
She said to me,

2331
01:18:39,501 --> 01:18:40,760
she's an imaginary person,

2332
01:18:40,761 --> 01:18:44,900
but I need to tell you where the black
light thing happened because then you can

2333
01:18:44,901 --> 01:18:46,190
really start making fun of her.

2334
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:47,010
Okay.

2335
01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:48,780
The how,

2336
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:50,480
so how did she find out about this car?

2337
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:53,560
She found out about the
scar at a UFO convention.

2338
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:58,570
She said that there was a booth where
someone had written in black sharpie scans

2339
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:04,660
for alien implants and you go into the
booth and they make you take your clothes

2340
01:19:05,001 --> 01:19:09,020
off and they run a blacklight
over your body and they tell you,

2341
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:12,430
they tell you if you have an implant and

2342
01:19:14,210 --> 01:19:15,410
life is beautiful.

2343
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:17,330
It's really beautiful.

2344
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:20,060
Life is a beautiful thing
because it's a play.

2345
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:20,331
It's,

2346
01:19:20,331 --> 01:19:20,551
it's,

2347
01:19:20,551 --> 01:19:20,751
it's,

2348
01:19:20,751 --> 01:19:22,610
we're watching it all play out.

2349
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:27,910
It's really a grand piece of artwork
that's constructed for our amusement.

2350
01:19:28,251 --> 01:19:29,210
There's no other way.

2351
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:31,220
There's no other way that could be real.

2352
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:35,240
There's no other way that someone could
have a booth at a Ufo conference where

2353
01:19:35,241 --> 01:19:38,330
you have to take your clothes off and
they'd look at you with a black light,

2354
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:39,260
which oh,

2355
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:43,370
just so happens to show
loads all the loads on you,

2356
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:49,430
all the loads on you glow like one of
those panther paintings that you had in

2357
01:19:49,431 --> 01:19:50,270
high school.

2358
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:52,280
I remember those black
light posters that you had.

2359
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:57,370
The panther had like yellow teeth and
claws and yellow eyes and little little

2360
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,140
red with his mouth.

2361
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,400
Maybe truck dealer had won.

2362
01:20:01,401 --> 01:20:02,390
Those were the shit.

2363
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:03,950
That's what they're looking for.

2364
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,010
The idea is so

2365
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:10,020
that that's how she found out about this,

2366
01:20:10,350 --> 01:20:13,260
that it really feels like we're in
the middle of a Coen brothers movie.

2367
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:14,581
This,

2368
01:20:14,581 --> 01:20:15,151
this is that.

2369
01:20:15,151 --> 01:20:20,151
This is a real person and this is
really happening in today in 2013 in the

2370
01:20:20,461 --> 01:20:24,750
modern era of smartphones pressing Google,

2371
01:20:24,751 --> 01:20:25,740
asking it where to go.

2372
01:20:25,741 --> 01:20:27,810
It gives you directions in this world.

2373
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:32,490
Someone finds themselves naked with
a black light going over their body,

2374
01:20:32,491 --> 01:20:37,491
while some white guy with dreadlocks is
telling them about scars that they got

2375
01:20:37,651 --> 01:20:39,350
because they were picked up by aliens.

2376
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:39,781
She said,

2377
01:20:39,781 --> 01:20:40,860
the guy worked at NASA.

2378
01:20:42,190 --> 01:20:43,160
I'm Fuzzy Dick.

2379
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:44,670
He's a cleanup guy,

2380
01:20:44,671 --> 01:20:45,710
cleans up the spoon.

2381
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:46,641
He said,

2382
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:48,180
NASA cleanup booth guy.

2383
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,510
They have a devotee of peep booth at NASA.

2384
01:20:51,511 --> 01:20:52,240
It's very well it's,

2385
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:52,560
you know,

2386
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,590
a lot of those astronauts is
through a very stressful job.

2387
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:56,790
They need to unwind.

2388
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:57,840
They like peep booths.

2389
01:20:58,170 --> 01:20:58,651
This guy,

2390
01:20:58,651 --> 01:21:00,830
he's the official mopper well

2391
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:04,350
shows live with a black light at parties.

2392
01:21:05,290 --> 01:21:06,580
He keeps everything rocking.

2393
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:09,360
This fucking guy's got
his own black light.

2394
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:11,190
Jesus Christ.

2395
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:12,960
Glow sticks to the dickhead.

2396
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:15,151
I agree,

2397
01:21:15,151 --> 01:21:15,511
man.

2398
01:21:15,511 --> 01:21:16,830
It's what you believe.

2399
01:21:16,831 --> 01:21:17,664
This woman,

2400
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:20,490
I believe this is the part
that's going to get on TV.

2401
01:21:25,190 --> 01:21:25,410
See,

2402
01:21:25,410 --> 01:21:27,490
these are real podcasts
now you know your Fox,

2403
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:28,383
okay?

2404
01:21:28,610 --> 01:21:33,610
I believe that she experienced some
believe that she's hot and hypnotic.

2405
01:21:33,651 --> 01:21:34,700
Let's start with that.

2406
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:35,810
She's hot.

2407
01:21:35,810 --> 01:21:38,420
She's hypnotic in you and I both know
that you've always had a thing for

2408
01:21:38,421 --> 01:21:39,500
tattooed up girls,

2409
01:21:40,190 --> 01:21:41,480
especially girls with good work.

2410
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:42,171
Let's be honest,

2411
01:21:42,171 --> 01:21:42,920
who doesn't?

2412
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:44,030
That's a dangerous woman,

2413
01:21:44,031 --> 01:21:45,020
willing to take chances,

2414
01:21:45,230 --> 01:21:46,790
and if you're a standup comedians,

2415
01:21:46,791 --> 01:21:48,260
that's the type of person
you need in your life.

2416
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:49,250
Right.

2417
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:49,521
Okay.

2418
01:21:49,521 --> 01:21:49,791
Okay.

2419
01:21:49,791 --> 01:21:50,241
That's all.

2420
01:21:50,241 --> 01:21:51,170
She's gangster.

2421
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:51,980
Yes.

2422
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:52,370
Okay,

2423
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:53,001
so you liked that,

2424
01:21:53,001 --> 01:21:53,500
right?

2425
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:53,750
Yeah,

2426
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:54,140
me too.

2427
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:54,441
All right,

2428
01:21:54,441 --> 01:21:55,274
go ahead.

2429
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:56,870
So you're infatuated.

2430
01:21:56,871 --> 01:21:57,830
You're intoxicated.

2431
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:58,701
This beautiful woman,

2432
01:21:58,701 --> 01:21:58,941
God,

2433
01:21:58,941 --> 01:21:59,681
you're so close to it.

2434
01:21:59,681 --> 01:22:02,330
You could smell her and she's
showing you her little scars.

2435
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:02,891
Oh,

2436
01:22:02,891 --> 01:22:03,461
wow.

2437
01:22:03,461 --> 01:22:03,790
Yeah,

2438
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:04,950
I can totally see it.

2439
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,210
Yeah.

2440
01:22:06,210 --> 01:22:10,760
You get a black light and
you know we can look cool.

2441
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,011
Next thing you know,

2442
01:22:17,011 --> 01:22:18,250
she's wearing your fedora.

2443
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:19,240
You're both naked.

2444
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:21,450
You still got your socks off,

2445
01:22:23,930 --> 01:22:27,720
black lights going back and forth
in a dressing room somewhere.

2446
01:22:29,130 --> 01:22:29,963
Yes.

2447
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:30,380
Yeah,

2448
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:30,751
easily.

2449
01:22:30,751 --> 01:22:31,210
Man,

2450
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:32,130
I can see it.

2451
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:33,390
Okay.

2452
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:36,480
You're not really going to give me an
accurate assessment of what really went

2453
01:22:36,481 --> 01:22:37,314
down.

2454
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:37,710
I wouldn't.

2455
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:39,000
I need to be there with you.

2456
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:41,580
I need to be there with you
to watch your chemical makeup,

2457
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:45,000
to watch your body shift
like a giant human mood ring.

2458
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:52,260
All of a sudden you just green
with horniness as you're glowing,

2459
01:22:52,261 --> 01:22:53,094
like the whole,

2460
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:55,290
if you were a mood ring,

2461
01:22:55,291 --> 01:22:57,210
it would start cracking at the seams,

2462
01:22:57,220 --> 01:23:00,210
would be able to take
the g force of green.

2463
01:23:00,211 --> 01:23:03,600
It's pumping into the size of
this poor fucking mood ring.

2464
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:04,463
Here's the thing,

2465
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:06,010
like a big

2466
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:07,720
aquarium trying to hold in sharks

2467
01:23:10,030 --> 01:23:13,180
explodes and takes your finger
off with it just because,

2468
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:13,751
okay,

2469
01:23:13,751 --> 01:23:18,610
so just cause a pretty girl is talking
about aliens doesn't mean that a person

2470
01:23:18,611 --> 01:23:20,860
showing you were skin
lifting up her clothes.

2471
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,090
She's going like this.

2472
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:22,983
Sorry.

2473
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:23,900
Sorry.

2474
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:25,860
That's about seven inches
from my been saying.

2475
01:23:26,650 --> 01:23:29,080
If you went from my pussy
up with your fingers,

2476
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:29,943
you would,

2477
01:23:30,730 --> 01:23:31,930
it'd be like seven inches.

2478
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:32,890
Look man,

2479
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:36,940
all of what you're saying is accurate.

2480
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:41,680
It's not.

2481
01:23:41,681 --> 01:23:43,180
It doesn't mean she wasn't abducted.

2482
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:43,901
Exactly.

2483
01:23:43,901 --> 01:23:44,734
Exactly.

2484
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:45,880
It's like you said earlier,

2485
01:23:46,570 --> 01:23:49,540
just because you're paranoid
doesn't mean enough following.

2486
01:23:49,541 --> 01:23:50,374
Yes.

2487
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:51,910
Just cause you're a beautiful,

2488
01:23:51,911 --> 01:23:56,380
tattooed girl with an invisible scar
doesn't mean that you didn't get abducted

2489
01:23:56,381 --> 01:23:56,950
by aliens.

2490
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:58,570
Just because you're a crazy liar.

2491
01:23:58,630 --> 01:24:01,000
It doesn't mean you haven't
really been a board of Ufo.

2492
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:01,810
That's right.

2493
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:02,320
That's right.

2494
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,430
That's exactly right.

2495
01:24:03,431 --> 01:24:04,060
So,

2496
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:04,391
you know,

2497
01:24:04,391 --> 01:24:07,510
that's why I'm looking forward to
getting the results of her tasks.

2498
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:09,430
You guys going to stay in touch?

2499
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:13,510
Can I send her an email?

2500
01:24:13,511 --> 01:24:14,560
You're not going to
believe this is the bid.

2501
01:24:14,561 --> 01:24:19,300
They just came out with a new type of
black light that works best on naked

2502
01:24:19,301 --> 01:24:19,930
girls.

2503
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:20,830
It's amazing.

2504
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:21,071
I,

2505
01:24:21,071 --> 01:24:23,140
I'm an Amazon prime member and it's uh,

2506
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:24,693
it's already here.

2507
01:24:24,910 --> 01:24:25,471
It's here.

2508
01:24:25,471 --> 01:24:27,190
Like you could come over
and try it if you want.

2509
01:24:27,191 --> 01:24:27,371
I mean,

2510
01:24:27,371 --> 01:24:28,230
I'm totally cool with it.

2511
01:24:28,231 --> 01:24:28,540
Oh,

2512
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:29,620
it is dark out.

2513
01:24:29,621 --> 01:24:31,030
She has a boyfriend.

2514
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:31,690
Okay.

2515
01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:33,220
Just these are just jokes folks.

2516
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,121
We don't mean anything.

2517
01:24:34,121 --> 01:24:35,180
We're saying not at all.

2518
01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:35,531
Okay.

2519
01:24:35,531 --> 01:24:40,531
But what I am saying is that I'm not
entirely sure that you were the hard nose

2520
01:24:41,621 --> 01:24:42,454
private.

2521
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:44,680
I would have liked on the case.

2522
01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:48,971
No Way,

2523
01:24:48,971 --> 01:24:49,804
man.

2524
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:50,800
No Way.

2525
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,710
You're not going to get an ambush me.

2526
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:53,770
And that's a course.

2527
01:24:53,771 --> 01:24:56,110
Not of course not God,

2528
01:24:56,111 --> 01:24:56,830
man.

2529
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:57,281
Hey Man.

2530
01:24:57,281 --> 01:24:58,660
Even if it was a charismatic man,

2531
01:24:58,810 --> 01:24:59,111
okay.

2532
01:24:59,111 --> 01:25:03,400
I have often wondered if Tom Cruise
is trying to convince me of something.

2533
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:05,470
I've seen Tom Cruise give interviews.

2534
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:07,400
He's incredibly convincing.

2535
01:25:07,810 --> 01:25:08,643
Okay.

2536
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:11,650
I've seen Tom cruise argue with people
about stuff you don't want to be in an

2537
01:25:11,651 --> 01:25:15,070
argument with Tom Cruise now and if
Tom Cruise is telling you about his UFO

2538
01:25:15,071 --> 01:25:15,904
abduction,

2539
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:17,020
you might,

2540
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:18,250
you might be inclined to believe it,

2541
01:25:18,251 --> 01:25:20,140
man might be inclined to believe it.

2542
01:25:20,141 --> 01:25:24,520
He might be so charismatic that he can
just hit every note exactly the right way

2543
01:25:24,521 --> 01:25:25,930
with the right amount of pause,

2544
01:25:25,931 --> 01:25:28,570
the right amount of
sincere emotional content.

2545
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:29,171
You know,

2546
01:25:29,171 --> 01:25:29,381
man,

2547
01:25:29,381 --> 01:25:30,670
I have no proof of this.

2548
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:33,010
And I'd say if this goes on the show,

2549
01:25:33,011 --> 01:25:34,480
you're all getting a huge lawsuit.

2550
01:25:34,481 --> 01:25:38,010
But I heard that Tom Cruise pays guys to
come into his gym when he's working on

2551
01:25:38,030 --> 01:25:38,863
rape him.

2552
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,113
Let's edit that out.

2553
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:44,223
Um,

2554
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:45,783
okay.

2555
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:47,421
All right.

2556
01:25:47,421 --> 01:25:48,850
We wrapped up Nicole dumb

2557
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:51,453
start with,

2558
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:55,720
okay.

2559
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:56,021
Okay.

2560
01:25:56,021 --> 01:25:56,854
Okay.

2561
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:57,813
Okay.

2562
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,210
So what were your impressions of Nicole?

2563
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:03,650
She was a very focused

2564
01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:08,390
and you go to start by that time,

2565
01:26:08,391 --> 01:26:08,841
there's more.

2566
01:26:08,841 --> 01:26:09,674
Yeah.

2567
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:13,250
For more information about this
much for this conversation,

2568
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:14,120
you're not going to get all of it.

2569
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:15,133
Okay.

2570
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:15,621
Sorry.

2571
01:26:15,621 --> 01:26:17,170
It's [inaudible] dot
com they're not gonna,

2572
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:18,410
they're not gonna show all this shit.

2573
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:20,570
But for more information,

2574
01:26:20,571 --> 01:26:23,060
go to [inaudible] dot com we
have a lot more of this up there.

2575
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:24,350
We had to edit this.

2576
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:25,660
It's a 44 minute shelf up.

2577
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:27,453
Um,

2578
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:28,820
okay.

2579
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:30,320
And then can it be said

2580
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:32,813
what?

2581
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:34,681
It's all right to say it.

2582
01:26:34,681 --> 01:26:35,350
The camera again.

2583
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:36,183
I think that's fine.

2584
01:26:36,190 --> 01:26:36,581
Yeah.

2585
01:26:36,581 --> 01:26:36,851
Yeah,

2586
01:26:36,851 --> 01:26:37,061
yeah.

2587
01:26:37,061 --> 01:26:37,811
It doesn't matter what,

2588
01:26:37,811 --> 01:26:39,910
that might be funny as like as each other,

2589
01:26:39,911 --> 01:26:41,470
what would happen if you got abducted,

2590
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:44,010
but you got to each of
you and that was okay.

2591
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:44,923
We're good.

2592
01:26:46,230 --> 01:26:47,280
Um,

2593
01:26:47,650 --> 01:26:49,090
what do you think would happen?

2594
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:49,840
We good.

2595
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:50,350
We good?

2596
01:26:50,350 --> 01:26:51,183
Yep.

2597
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:53,473
Okay.

2598
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:56,840
Have you ever saw it about what
you would do if you were abducted?

2599
01:26:58,010 --> 01:26:59,060
What do you think would happen?

2600
01:26:59,550 --> 01:27:04,550
I'd cry and scream and try to keep
whatever I could out of my asshole.

2601
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:16,280
Would you or would you worry that if you
didn't give up they would just paralyze

2602
01:27:17,781 --> 01:27:18,411
you and,

2603
01:27:18,411 --> 01:27:19,720
and do horrible things to you?

2604
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:20,180
Maybe,

2605
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:21,110
maybe even kill you?

2606
01:27:21,990 --> 01:27:22,340
Yeah,

2607
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:22,731
I mean,

2608
01:27:22,731 --> 01:27:26,270
I think that that is what happens
is they end up paralyzing you.

2609
01:27:26,510 --> 01:27:28,840
Do you think that people
have ever been killed by you?

2610
01:27:28,841 --> 01:27:29,674
LFOS

2611
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:31,481
yeah,

2612
01:27:31,481 --> 01:27:32,410
I don't think so.

2613
01:27:32,411 --> 01:27:33,580
I don't know man.

2614
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:34,780
I mean it killed by you,

2615
01:27:34,781 --> 01:27:35,614
fos.

2616
01:27:36,010 --> 01:27:36,610
No,

2617
01:27:36,610 --> 01:27:36,880
no.

2618
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:37,591
I don't think people,

2619
01:27:37,591 --> 01:27:38,510
men killed by your foes,

2620
01:27:38,530 --> 01:27:43,030
but plenty of people say that they've
gotten sucked up onto these ships and some

2621
01:27:43,031 --> 01:27:43,751
people think that it's,

2622
01:27:43,751 --> 01:27:43,971
you have,

2623
01:27:43,971 --> 01:27:44,621
as some people say,

2624
01:27:44,621 --> 01:27:46,450
it could just be government agents.

2625
01:27:46,570 --> 01:27:47,380
By the way,

2626
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:48,213
if you're a,

2627
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:49,113
here's the thing,

2628
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:50,830
if you're an inventor,

2629
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:52,420
but you're also a Perv,

2630
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:56,380
all you have to do is have a levitating
craft that can suck people into that.

2631
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:59,830
They're totally cool with getting caught
as we still ahead of the curve though.

2632
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,270
And the fun that thing,

2633
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:02,320
you'd have to sell it.

2634
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,840
You'd have to sell them to fund it and
then it would go public and then it would

2635
01:28:04,841 --> 01:28:06,400
get out and then people would be careful.

2636
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,110
They would wear special tinfoil hats,

2637
01:28:08,111 --> 01:28:10,720
doesn't allow them to get sucked
into your giant rape ship.

2638
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:12,190
People talk about it.

2639
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:15,640
If you get sucked up into
a UFO and you get probed,

2640
01:28:15,641 --> 01:28:16,474
as they call it,

2641
01:28:16,690 --> 01:28:17,740
people talk about it.

2642
01:28:17,741 --> 01:28:17,980
No,

2643
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:21,700
he went to essentially violating
experience taken into some guy's trailer.

2644
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:25,300
Like if that happened to you or you're
just walking down the street and somehow

2645
01:28:25,301 --> 01:28:30,301
you got hypnotized by like a spiral in
a trailer park and you ended up getting

2646
01:28:30,671 --> 01:28:35,620
like probed by some redneck dude wanted
to shove his water bong inside of you,

2647
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:37,060
you wouldn't talk about that.

2648
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:38,860
That's not a story you share.

2649
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:43,980
But somehow if you get taken up into a
silver trailer in space and get probed by

2650
01:28:44,411 --> 01:28:44,831
a thing,

2651
01:28:44,831 --> 01:28:45,161
it's like,

2652
01:28:45,161 --> 01:28:45,461
hey,

2653
01:28:45,461 --> 01:28:46,294
I got probed.

2654
01:28:46,330 --> 01:28:50,110
Well it's always a medical experiment
was never sexual in nature.

2655
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:51,250
Never left purposely.

2656
01:28:55,930 --> 01:28:57,910
So aliens are creeps.

2657
01:28:58,210 --> 01:28:59,590
So if you were abducted,

2658
01:28:59,591 --> 01:29:02,130
but are they whose creepier and the alien

2659
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:03,270
or the zookeeper?

2660
01:29:04,770 --> 01:29:05,603
The alien.

2661
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:06,520
Why?

2662
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:07,590
Because they do it to people.

2663
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:10,980
How about the guy who works at seaworld
tells dolphins they have to flip or they

2664
01:29:10,981 --> 01:29:13,650
don't get fish who's creepier?

2665
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:17,940
I'd say the aliens are less creepy
cause they seem to leave us in the wild.

2666
01:29:18,450 --> 01:29:19,650
They don't seem to keep us.

2667
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:22,650
They don't seem to be like kidnapping
people left and right and sucking them up

2668
01:29:22,651 --> 01:29:23,490
in a giant space.

2669
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:24,260
Zoos,

2670
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:26,400
I say the aliens are less
creepy than the zookeeper.

2671
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:26,940
Okay.

2672
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:28,020
Let me ask you this.

2673
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:29,540
If I told you that I drew,

2674
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:33,720
drove around in my car and from time to
time picked up stray dogs and shoved my

2675
01:29:33,721 --> 01:29:34,270
fingers,

2676
01:29:34,270 --> 01:29:35,103
they're assholes

2677
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:38,040
and then put them back out in the street.

2678
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:40,061
What'd you think?

2679
01:29:40,061 --> 01:29:40,894
I was creepy.

2680
01:29:41,570 --> 01:29:42,331
I look,

2681
01:29:42,331 --> 01:29:43,141
I love you man.

2682
01:29:43,141 --> 01:29:44,850
So I'm not the best person to judge.

2683
01:29:45,450 --> 01:29:46,290
I'd forgive you.

2684
01:29:46,390 --> 01:29:47,870
I say he's probably shouldn't do that,

2685
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:48,121
man.

2686
01:29:48,121 --> 01:29:49,230
It's probably bad Karma,

2687
01:29:49,820 --> 01:29:52,140
but it's not like I would rat
you out for something like that.

2688
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:54,143
Friends Dude.

2689
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:58,000
But I think that,

2690
01:29:58,680 --> 01:29:59,190
I mean,

2691
01:29:59,190 --> 01:30:00,560
I don't know that,

2692
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:01,141
like I said,

2693
01:30:01,141 --> 01:30:02,280
I don't know anyone who,

2694
01:30:02,281 --> 01:30:05,130
I legitimately believe their
alien abduction experience,

2695
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:07,650
so I don't know what's happening.

2696
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:12,570
I don't know if it is just in fact a
memory that someone has introduced into

2697
01:30:12,571 --> 01:30:15,720
their mind and they relay
it as if it was a fact,

2698
01:30:15,721 --> 01:30:17,640
but much like my real memories,

2699
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:19,440
they're very sketchy.

2700
01:30:19,441 --> 01:30:23,160
I've had some beautiful moments in my
life and I look back on them and there's

2701
01:30:23,530 --> 01:30:26,130
duff flashes and trying to
try to piece it together,

2702
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:26,620
you know,

2703
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:29,460
try to piece together some of the
most memorable spec tack rule events,

2704
01:30:29,670 --> 01:30:31,200
spectacular events in your life.

2705
01:30:31,201 --> 01:30:32,011
And they still,

2706
01:30:32,011 --> 01:30:37,011
they come off like weird slideshows of
blurry images and a narrative that you

2707
01:30:37,921 --> 01:30:41,160
can follow in your head because
you know it cause you remember it.

2708
01:30:41,161 --> 01:30:42,990
And also because you've
said it a bunch of times,

2709
01:30:42,991 --> 01:30:44,520
you told people about the experience,

2710
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,320
but the reality of your memories,

2711
01:30:46,321 --> 01:30:47,280
there's terrible.

2712
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:47,921
So it's,

2713
01:30:47,921 --> 01:30:51,330
it's so hard to say what
exactly is going on.

2714
01:30:51,390 --> 01:30:51,541
Well,

2715
01:30:51,541 --> 01:30:53,310
you know what those gray aliens look like,

2716
01:30:53,311 --> 01:30:54,030
right?

2717
01:30:54,030 --> 01:30:54,863
They look like,

2718
01:30:55,010 --> 01:30:57,240
and I think someone else
has posited this theory,

2719
01:30:57,241 --> 01:31:00,450
but if you look at the gray
aliens and you take a doctor with,

2720
01:31:00,451 --> 01:31:00,630
um,

2721
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:01,463
with a,

2722
01:31:01,610 --> 01:31:02,340
um,

2723
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:06,870
medical mask on and you look
at him delivering a baby,

2724
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:09,330
the first thing a lot
of people see is this,

2725
01:31:09,331 --> 01:31:10,410
that kind of shape,

2726
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:11,551
that kind of thing.

2727
01:31:11,551 --> 01:31:15,450
And when you're taken out of the womb and
suddenly they're running medical tests

2728
01:31:15,451 --> 01:31:15,691
on you,

2729
01:31:15,691 --> 01:31:17,070
which is what happens when you're born.

2730
01:31:17,071 --> 01:31:17,671
They weigh you,

2731
01:31:17,671 --> 01:31:19,050
they do all this weird shit to you.

2732
01:31:19,051 --> 01:31:23,730
I don't know exactly what then that is
a very traumatic experience and some

2733
01:31:23,731 --> 01:31:28,731
people say that alien of dod teas are
actually reliving the trauma of birth.

2734
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:32,340
That's what they're experiencing is the
trauma of being yanked out of a very

2735
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:33,241
warm,

2736
01:31:33,241 --> 01:31:38,190
safe place and being poked and prodded
by beings that you can't possibly

2737
01:31:38,191 --> 01:31:40,890
understand because you've never seen
another human being in your life.

2738
01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:42,030
Totally makes sense.

2739
01:31:42,031 --> 01:31:46,590
And then also it sort of makes sense why
there's such a clinical nature to all

2740
01:31:46,610 --> 01:31:51,610
these experiences and it's always these
cold tables and it pokes and no one's

2741
01:31:51,751 --> 01:31:52,171
talking.

2742
01:31:52,171 --> 01:31:52,441
You know,

2743
01:31:52,441 --> 01:31:54,270
one's loving and warm and comforting.

2744
01:31:54,570 --> 01:31:59,570
It's always just medical and cold and
sanitary and and very dark and bleak.

2745
01:32:00,311 --> 01:32:02,950
And the room seems
impossibly large and bright.

2746
01:32:03,070 --> 01:32:03,491
Yes,

2747
01:32:03,491 --> 01:32:04,660
that's exactly what it is.

2748
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:09,720
It's probably just an implanted memory
that's distorted radically over the years

2749
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:14,650
and added to with dreams and all
sorts of other paranoia's that you,

2750
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:19,240
you gather up and stew together over
the course of a lifetime and then while

2751
01:32:19,241 --> 01:32:21,310
you're sleeping and they
all come boiling together,

2752
01:32:25,070 --> 01:32:26,170
taking me away.

2753
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:27,671
Meanwhile,

2754
01:32:27,671 --> 01:32:28,750
you're just a baby.

2755
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,250
Yeah.

2756
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:32,980
You're just a little baby shitting all
over yourself screaming for the first

2757
01:32:32,981 --> 01:32:33,460
time,

2758
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:34,960
staring at a fluorescent life.

2759
01:32:34,961 --> 01:32:37,570
When you've been inside of a
pussy for the last nine months,

2760
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:40,460
you don't have a fucking clue
as to what you're seeing now.

2761
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:40,661
You,

2762
01:32:40,661 --> 01:32:42,250
how would you not remember that?

2763
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:44,170
There was a big question,

2764
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:46,330
but why would we assume that
kids don't remember that?

2765
01:32:46,331 --> 01:32:48,700
Some people say he tried to block it
out of your memory because it's so

2766
01:32:48,701 --> 01:32:49,534
traumatic.

2767
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:51,160
Horrible thing.

2768
01:32:51,310 --> 01:32:54,940
Especially if you get circumcised spraying
out of that thing and they snipped

2769
01:32:54,941 --> 01:32:56,020
the tip of your cock off.

2770
01:32:56,021 --> 01:32:56,854
Exactly.

2771
01:32:57,190 --> 01:32:57,970
Exactly.

2772
01:32:57,970 --> 01:32:59,470
And how about if it's done in north docs,

2773
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:02,620
Jewish way where the oil
has to suck on it stuff.

2774
01:33:02,621 --> 01:33:03,454
The bleeding.

2775
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:04,720
I tried to forget it.

2776
01:33:05,050 --> 01:33:05,501
Yeah,

2777
01:33:05,501 --> 01:33:06,460
the hell are you gonna remember that.

2778
01:33:06,490 --> 01:33:07,323
You don't want to,

2779
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:10,120
I don't even want to think about
it happening to other people.

2780
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:10,481
Well,

2781
01:33:10,481 --> 01:33:15,220
you answered my question for me about
how I feel about being abducted.

2782
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:17,380
I was going to turn the
same question to myself.

2783
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:18,910
What would you do exactly?

2784
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:20,350
Try to stop something from going to my,

2785
01:33:20,351 --> 01:33:21,540
but that's it.

2786
01:33:21,541 --> 01:33:24,910
It's what you do switch to do because
it probably doesn't really happen.

2787
01:33:25,150 --> 01:33:25,840
You know what?

2788
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,120
I don't think it really happens
and if it does really happen,

2789
01:33:28,121 --> 01:33:29,410
I don't think it happens physically.

2790
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:30,940
I might be wrong,

2791
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:32,493
I might be wrong,

2792
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:33,670
but I don't think it happens.

2793
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:37,840
Just not enough.

2794
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:38,261
No,

2795
01:33:38,261 --> 01:33:39,094
no videos.

2796
01:33:39,370 --> 01:33:44,020
It's not a single like security video of
a guy like leaving his body and flying

2797
01:33:44,021 --> 01:33:47,500
through the walls and aliens come and
taking them away and the wife Getting Up

2798
01:33:47,501 --> 01:33:49,360
to pee in the middle of the
night and the husband's gone.

2799
01:33:49,361 --> 01:33:53,350
She calls nine one one and 10 minutes
later he just appears magically underneath

2800
01:33:53,351 --> 01:33:54,184
the covers.

2801
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:55,030
There's no,

2802
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:56,080
there's none of that roof.

2803
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:56,973
There's no video.

2804
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,290
There's no nothing because
a bunch of weird people.

2805
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:01,600
They're telling weird stories
and that's all you get.

2806
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:04,000
And that's all you're
going to get bank on it.

2807
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:05,470
Put it all in the bank.

2808
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:06,910
Bet It all on black.

2809
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:08,710
You don't have a fucking chance.

2810
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:10,930
No one's pulling anything back.

2811
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,370
No one's going to get a picture.

2812
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:14,860
No one's going to have an
implant that's worth a shit.

2813
01:34:15,070 --> 01:34:18,610
No one's going to have a single photograph
that doesn't look like bullshit.

2814
01:34:19,030 --> 01:34:19,840
No one,

2815
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:20,673
there'll be nothing.

2816
01:34:20,710 --> 01:34:23,140
There'll be no evidence until there is,

2817
01:34:23,770 --> 01:34:24,700
there'll be no evidence.

2818
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:27,310
I think that we never get to that point.

2819
01:34:27,311 --> 01:34:28,060
How about that?

2820
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:32,350
I think human beings get lodged into a
simulation long before we ever figured

2821
01:34:32,351 --> 01:34:35,800
out how to really live this planet and I
think that probably happens exactly the

2822
01:34:35,801 --> 01:34:37,300
same all throughout the universe.

2823
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:41,470
I bet the only space travel that
people do is inside of simulations.

2824
01:34:41,830 --> 01:34:44,710
I bet no one ever gets past it
or that this is what life does.

2825
01:34:44,711 --> 01:34:46,450
Life creates an artificial reality.

2826
01:34:46,451 --> 01:34:48,970
As soon as it knows how
to and jumps in there,

2827
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:53,500
they create an artificial version of what
they would like when they figured out

2828
01:34:53,501 --> 01:34:55,170
that the the human synapse,

2829
01:34:55,171 --> 01:34:58,370
is it just a bunch of ones and
zeros and boil it down and copy

2830
01:34:58,370 --> 01:34:59,330
it and duplicate it.

2831
01:34:59,770 --> 01:35:00,603
I think they just,

2832
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:01,543
that's what we do.

2833
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:02,720
No one ever gets anywhere.

2834
01:35:02,830 --> 01:35:03,200
It's a,

2835
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:03,411
well,

2836
01:35:03,411 --> 01:35:05,530
I mean it's so much more economical too,

2837
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:06,573
and it just,

2838
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:07,281
it is,

2839
01:35:07,281 --> 01:35:07,581
I mean,

2840
01:35:07,581 --> 01:35:11,720
it's easier to go into the depths of your
mind than it is to build some kind of

2841
01:35:11,721 --> 01:35:13,610
ship and go flying to a dead planet.

2842
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:14,683
Look at dirt.

2843
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:15,021
Look,

2844
01:35:15,021 --> 01:35:15,860
I could be wrong,

2845
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:17,900
but I don't think anybody
ever goes anywhere.

2846
01:35:18,830 --> 01:35:19,663
I could be wrong,

2847
01:35:19,670 --> 01:35:22,040
but I don't think any of these
abductors I've ever left their bed.

2848
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:24,920
I don't think that anybody that's
telling you these stories has ever really

2849
01:35:24,921 --> 01:35:26,540
experienced anything in a physical sense.

2850
01:35:26,541 --> 01:35:27,890
It doesn't mean it didn't really happen,

2851
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:32,120
but I think that if you could put a
camera over them while they slept and when

2852
01:35:32,121 --> 01:35:34,130
they woke up in the morning
with this fantastic story,

2853
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:36,740
but you wouldn't see nothing.

2854
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:38,660
I'm afraid that you may be right.

2855
01:35:38,661 --> 01:35:40,640
It could just be a subjective experience.

2856
01:35:40,641 --> 01:35:42,770
It could be some kind of traumatic memory.

2857
01:35:43,010 --> 01:35:46,820
It could be a lot of things that
are in the subconscious mind,

2858
01:35:46,821 --> 01:35:48,080
but one thing's for certain.

2859
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:51,620
A lot of people have had this
experience now why they're having it,

2860
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:52,371
who knows?

2861
01:35:52,371 --> 01:35:52,791
But yeah,

2862
01:35:52,791 --> 01:35:55,190
you would think with the number of
people are having this experience,

2863
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:59,300
you drive down the road and look to the
side and see people getting sucked up

2864
01:35:59,301 --> 01:36:04,301
into the sky and clouds coming back
down confused and people have things,

2865
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:07,400
they have seen things and you
just don't know the stories.

2866
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:07,911
You know?

2867
01:36:07,911 --> 01:36:09,440
You're sitting here all smug.

2868
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:10,430
But if it happened to you,

2869
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:10,820
man,

2870
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:11,690
imagine.

2871
01:36:11,990 --> 01:36:15,560
Imagine if it happened to you and no one
wants to believe your story and you're

2872
01:36:15,561 --> 01:36:17,360
worried about telling people at work.

2873
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:20,450
They might think you're crazy and you
lose your job and you can't feed your

2874
01:36:20,451 --> 01:36:21,200
family.

2875
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:22,033
Right?

2876
01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:24,410
You can't Cay Brown because
you're sitting here all smug.

2877
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:25,910
Must be nice.

2878
01:36:25,970 --> 01:36:28,820
Must be nice to be a standup
comedian living in Los Angeles.

2879
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:31,040
I'm in a trailer park in Oklahoma.

2880
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:34,940
Someone's suck me out of the sky and now
I can't tell my boss the coal mine or I

2881
01:36:34,941 --> 01:36:36,530
might lose my fucking kids.

2882
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:38,510
My wife's doing meth,

2883
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:40,340
my fucking tire's flat.

2884
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:41,233
I okay,

2885
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:43,370
you're kind of an asshole Dunkin.

2886
01:36:43,371 --> 01:36:47,000
You know that old you talking a lot of
shit about people that have actually had

2887
01:36:47,001 --> 01:36:48,020
unique experiences.

2888
01:36:48,230 --> 01:36:50,330
Sorry about don't know my life.

2889
01:36:50,331 --> 01:36:50,721
Dunkin,

2890
01:36:50,721 --> 01:36:51,830
you don't know what I have.

2891
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:54,440
What happened to me that
night changed me forever.

2892
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:55,161
Yeah,

2893
01:36:55,161 --> 01:36:55,994
I bet

2894
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,300
you're like the old worst.

2895
01:36:59,430 --> 01:37:01,030
If they got take him.

2896
01:37:02,090 --> 01:37:03,980
The aliens are when
they have duct that guy,

2897
01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:06,740
oh God.

2898
01:37:06,741 --> 01:37:11,210
Or He's playing golf drunk in the middle
of the night and they scoop him up,

2899
01:37:11,330 --> 01:37:12,700
put him back loop.

2900
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:14,120
You guys are dicks.

2901
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:14,511
Okay?

2902
01:37:14,511 --> 01:37:16,250
If I was super fucking advanced,

2903
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:18,080
who wouldn't just be stealing people?

2904
01:37:18,081 --> 01:37:19,070
Why they play golf,

2905
01:37:19,110 --> 01:37:22,820
spit in their face and
shit dealing with this guy.

2906
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:23,531
But that's that.

2907
01:37:23,531 --> 01:37:23,720
You know,

2908
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:24,920
that is one thing man,

2909
01:37:24,921 --> 01:37:25,754
that like,

2910
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:26,090
uh,

2911
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:27,140
what do you know?

2912
01:37:27,141 --> 01:37:31,260
What if you could just like
overpower the aliens like you get,

2913
01:37:31,261 --> 01:37:34,880
you never hear about people getting
abducted and then wrestling the aliens to

2914
01:37:34,881 --> 01:37:35,480
the ground.

2915
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:37,910
These are apparently
these frail little beings.

2916
01:37:37,911 --> 01:37:39,050
What if you could fight them?

2917
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:43,700
I think that the idea is that they've
reached this point where they control

2918
01:37:43,701 --> 01:37:44,960
matter what their mind.

2919
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:48,140
That's why they have these giant heads
that are way bigger than ours and that's

2920
01:37:48,141 --> 01:37:50,080
why they don't seem to
talk with their mouths.

2921
01:37:50,250 --> 01:37:50,540
Yeah,

2922
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:50,841
look at me.

2923
01:37:50,841 --> 01:37:52,640
I'm like adding to the folklore.

2924
01:37:52,730 --> 01:37:53,870
I'm just making shit up.

2925
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:56,010
I don't know if any of this
has ever happened ever,

2926
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:56,993
but I'm like cool.

2927
01:37:57,870 --> 01:38:00,510
Culminating a bunch of
different idiot stories.

2928
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:02,060
Well they communicate with their mind.

2929
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:02,971
They do Dunkin,

2930
01:38:02,971 --> 01:38:03,340
what they do.

2931
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:05,520
So basically in plant ideas in your brain,

2932
01:38:05,550 --> 01:38:06,210
by the way,

2933
01:38:06,210 --> 01:38:07,050
JPL,

2934
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:08,280
you mentioned gps.

2935
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:09,480
You know where that comes from,

2936
01:38:09,481 --> 01:38:10,170
right?

2937
01:38:10,170 --> 01:38:11,850
That's John Parsons Laboratory.

2938
01:38:11,851 --> 01:38:13,470
You know John Parsons was right.

2939
01:38:13,650 --> 01:38:15,540
John Parsons was it that the rifle man,

2940
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:19,920
John Parsons is the Devonian
Allister car par salads.

2941
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:25,220
Parsons Parsons was a devotee of Alistair
Crawley who that's his laboratory.

2942
01:38:26,161 --> 01:38:27,150
So that Parsons,

2943
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:31,410
he believed in extra dimensional entities
and he would say prayers before he did

2944
01:38:31,411 --> 01:38:33,420
any of his tasks with
rocket fuel and stuff.

2945
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:34,290
And,

2946
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:34,650
uh,

2947
01:38:34,650 --> 01:38:35,820
l Ron Hubbard,

2948
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:37,290
the founder of Scientology,

2949
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:39,810
stole his girlfriend because
they used to hang out.

2950
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:41,490
You can look that stuff up.

2951
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:43,020
It's all 100% true.

2952
01:38:43,021 --> 01:38:45,030
There's a crater on the
moon named after him.

2953
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:45,421
Now,

2954
01:38:45,421 --> 01:38:46,650
Alister Crawley,

2955
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:47,941
he wants,

2956
01:38:47,941 --> 01:38:49,320
tried to summon the entity.

2957
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:53,310
This is way before people were talking
about aliens and the drawing that he drew

2958
01:38:53,311 --> 01:38:56,250
of the entity looks exactly
like the gray aliens.

2959
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:59,160
You can look that up
exactly like a gray alien.

2960
01:38:59,161 --> 01:39:01,290
So follow that weird Mays.

2961
01:39:01,740 --> 01:39:02,760
Ooh,

2962
01:39:03,130 --> 01:39:04,300
maybe it's Jack Parsons.

2963
01:39:04,301 --> 01:39:06,310
I can't remember which
Parsons does the rabbit hole.

2964
01:39:06,311 --> 01:39:07,144
Sun.

2965
01:39:07,510 --> 01:39:08,390
That's the right at all.

2966
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:09,370
We're done.

2967
01:39:09,370 --> 01:39:09,821
Anything else?

2968
01:39:09,821 --> 01:39:10,150
We good?
