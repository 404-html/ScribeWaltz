1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:03,331
Hey,

2
00:00:03,331 --> 00:00:04,260
you dirty fucks.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:05,933
We're back.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,833
Yay.

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,940
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
podcast is brought to you by marijuana.

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,863
Let's be honest.

7
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:13,891
I want,

8
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:15,000
I was going to have a lot to do with it.

9
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,440
Bulletproof coffee,

10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,630
marijuana traffic,

11
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,040
this brought to you by traffic.

12
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,700
I was hyped up because of traffic fucking
flying to get over here from talking

13
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:25,110
to chem trails experts all day.

14
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,170
stamps.com is our
sponsor for this podcast.

15
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,100
Um,

16
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,600
if you have a small business
and you're not using Sam's got,

17
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:32,770
excuse me,

18
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,180
you have a small business and
you're not using stamps.com.

19
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,860
I want you to check it out because
it saves a lot of bullshit.

20
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,820
It saves a lot of going
to the supermarket.

21
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,743
Supermarket.

22
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,280
You don't go to a post
office at the supermarket,

23
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,220
that'd be convenient here.

24
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:46,440
Male,

25
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,273
these wives shop.

26
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,030
No,

27
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,140
you go to the post office,

28
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:52,120
you're gonna have to wait in line and
if you're selling things that you're

29
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,461
sending over,

30
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:54,810
over through the mail,

31
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,220
it's a long process.

32
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,230
Wayne Shit and labeling it.

33
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,130
You can do all that through
your own home computer.

34
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,390
Simple and easy with stamps.com
it's an awesome service.

35
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,860
If you have your own business,

36
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,570
if you buy any of those little
desk squad t shirts that uh,

37
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,650
Brian cells with the kitty cat on them,

38
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,350
those are all coming
through stamps.com the,

39
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:17,250
the scale,

40
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,150
um,

41
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,590
that that's included with it.

42
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,690
There's a $110 offer,

43
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,730
$110 value offer.

44
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,661
If you,

45
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:25,410
um,

46
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,900
if you look in the
upper right hand corner,

47
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,010
stamps.com there's a
little microphone thing,

48
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,040
click on that and use the code word j
r e that's for Joe Rogan experience and

49
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:36,300
you will get $110 of value.

50
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:36,900
It's a,

51
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,660
they give you a $55
credit in postage and a,

52
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,511
they give you,

53
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:42,930
um,

54
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,930
this digital scale that you
don't use for illegal drugs.

55
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,470
You've fucks.

56
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,401
Okay,

57
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,330
this is the government,

58
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:52,680
this is stamps.com.

59
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,461
All right.

60
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:54,600
Have some respect.

61
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,273
But uh,

62
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,280
if you're doing something
like Brian does it a desk,

63
00:01:59,281 --> 00:01:59,521
squad.

64
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:00,091
Dot TV.

65
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:01,680
It's an awesome way to run a business,

66
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:01,891
right,

67
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:02,480
Brian?

68
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:02,721
Yeah,

69
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:03,481
it's the only way to do it.

70
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:08,481
I couldn't imagine having to do it
without stamps.com go into us post office

71
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,860
shit.

72
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,330
It digital scales are pretty bad ass.

73
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,700
Yeah,

74
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,240
they just plug in like know like
a USB cable into your computer.

75
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,343
You know what I think?

76
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,910
I think that this is all just one step
and that in a hundred years from now

77
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,040
you're never going to go
to a store to buy anything.

78
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:25,580
Everyone's going to have a three D
computer printer thing in your house and

79
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:27,530
you're just going to make
whatever the fuck you want.

80
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,260
This is not going to be like you'd go to
the apple store because he needed a new

81
00:02:30,261 --> 00:02:31,094
computer.

82
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,560
It's like you get the
whatever your ingredients,

83
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,290
you throw it into your fucking
printer and it makes you a computer.

84
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,340
That's what's going to happen.

85
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:41,510
So many people have been really pissed
off at me for talking bad about the post

86
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:42,440
office lately.

87
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:45,590
I noticed like a lot of male men
are yelling at me and I'm sorry,

88
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:45,980
I just,

89
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,850
I hate the mail.

90
00:02:46,851 --> 00:02:47,720
To me that's like,

91
00:02:47,721 --> 00:02:48,051
you know,

92
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:49,220
having a pager,

93
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,470
like I haven't checked the
mail and almost two months now,

94
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,191
which is horrible.

95
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:52,851
It's a bad idea.

96
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:54,800
I might open it up and put your drills.

97
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,461
Yeah,

98
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:57,620
I do most of them online and so I'm sure,

99
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,770
but I'm sure I'll through
there and be like,

100
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:00,370
fuck,

101
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,030
oh shit.

102
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,900
Oh Fuck Shit.

103
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:02,351
You know what I mean?

104
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:02,830
Right.

105
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,990
I just hate the mail.

106
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,983
It's all blurred.

107
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,080
Courtship.

108
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,761
I'm going to jail,

109
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:08,800
so I know I probably will be anyway,

110
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:09,910
go to stamps.com

111
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,640
entering the code word j,

112
00:03:11,641 --> 00:03:15,220
r e in the upper right hand corner
where the microphone is and uh,

113
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,260
save his house and kiss ass and $10 value.

114
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,220
That's what was selling.

115
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,580
We're also brought to you by
[inaudible] Dot Com that's o.

116
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:24,840
N N.

117
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:24,900
I t.

118
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,380
Um,

119
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,960
if you haven't seen any,

120
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,280
the shit that we have in now,

121
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:30,870
if you haven't been to
the store in a long time,

122
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,980
it's a,

123
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,160
it's expanding dramatically
on a regular basis,

124
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,580
uh,

125
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,660
between the kettle bells and the
fitness equipment that we started cell

126
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,533
recently.

127
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,493
Um,

128
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,760
of course a litany of different
vitamins and supplements.

129
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,330
Um,

130
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,540
including the ones that
are coming out this week.

131
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,320
I think it's called total primary care.

132
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:53,970
And they're going to
be like vitamin packs.

133
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,231
I don't think they're,

134
00:03:55,231 --> 00:03:55,441
yeah,

135
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:56,640
I don't think their facility yet.

136
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,520
But the Kettlebell is back in stock.

137
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,241
Yeah,

138
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,140
we got the chimps back.

139
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:01,771
We had an order,

140
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:02,790
a fuck load of them,

141
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,170
but they're there.

142
00:04:04,171 --> 00:04:07,410
They're interesting when they go
fast and the chimp looks like he's,

143
00:04:07,411 --> 00:04:07,890
uh,

144
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:08,820
he's very scary.

145
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,201
It's very scary.

146
00:04:10,201 --> 00:04:10,680
Chimp.

147
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,980
And so it motivates you while
you're working out Greg Fitzsimmons,

148
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,880
you see that mental chimp and you,

149
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,810
you imagine like what if I'm just
training myself to survive against a real

150
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:19,644
champ?

151
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:20,300
Yeah.

152
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:20,660
My,

153
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,493
my,

154
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,230
my bells or a DX.

155
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,863
I kind of,

156
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,150
yeah,

157
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,920
if guys were coming at me with Cox,

158
00:04:27,921 --> 00:04:29,540
like how hard I would work out.

159
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:29,900
Right.

160
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,733
You have a strong jaw,

161
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,230
have a strong jaw and um,

162
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:34,341
you know,

163
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,900
when I bench press,

164
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,300
I actually have a,

165
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,141
it's a cock.

166
00:04:39,141 --> 00:04:40,610
It's giant cock with weights on it.

167
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,480
That actually would be
an awkward thing to lift.

168
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,740
It's probably not a bad idea.

169
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,041
Well,

170
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:45,874
it has to be stiff.

171
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,770
Yeah.

172
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:46,960
I mean,

173
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,720
if you try to work out
with a flacid cock bar,

174
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,380
yeah.

175
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,010
You don't want that?

176
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:51,400
No.

177
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,000
And uh,

178
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,050
do you want a Black Hawk?

179
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,620
What do you want to paint your boards?

180
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,290
I don't want a cock at all.

181
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,550
That's why I'm pushing the weight.

182
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:57,851
Right.

183
00:04:57,851 --> 00:05:00,190
But what's scary or white
cock or a black hawk,

184
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,780
if you're going to go
with an artificial cock,

185
00:05:02,781 --> 00:05:03,521
it's gotta be black,

186
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:03,940
right?

187
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,710
Come on,

188
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,543
it's got other worse.

189
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,950
Or you know,

190
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,760
if like Asian people got like super
smart and they got tired of this,

191
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,200
all this little Dick,

192
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,100
you know,

193
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,570
shit that they always hear the tire,

194
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:17,500
that stereotype.

195
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,710
So they engineer their cocks
to be monstrous and that
becomes the new Har Cock

196
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:23,680
in the Asian caucus.

197
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,600
Asian caucus just become
like fucking walrus tusks.

198
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,210
Just big giant fat,

199
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,373
murderous.

200
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:32,870
Right,

201
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,410
right.

202
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:33,741
You know,

203
00:05:33,741 --> 00:05:34,131
and you know,

204
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:35,840
they're always trying to
come up with that solution.

205
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:36,860
That's why it's always like,

206
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,030
it's always like,

207
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:38,241
you know,

208
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:39,650
tusks of elephants.

209
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,150
It's always something dangerous.

210
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,650
Then we'll get an Asian man and erection.

211
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,960
They're trying to crack the
code being we have grow.

212
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,570
Why are you killing tigers?

213
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,380
Not only that,

214
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,640
you have Asian women,

215
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,400
they're the hottest
women of all of the rest.

216
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,690
I wonder what it is.

217
00:05:53,691 --> 00:05:53,901
One,

218
00:05:53,901 --> 00:05:54,734
if they're just,

219
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,850
they're just tired of it.

220
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,810
Wonder what it is.

221
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,180
Maybe what and why?

222
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,540
Why would they want to,

223
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,350
I mean,

224
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,101
why would they want,

225
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:01,934
first of all,

226
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:07,130
to try all this shit like tiger
bones and where's that coming from?

227
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:08,450
I mean there's no,

228
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,770
there's no logic to any of that.

229
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:10,901
Well,

230
00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:12,130
it's a very superstitious,

231
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,230
a lot of Asian cultures
are very superstitious.

232
00:06:14,231 --> 00:06:15,940
Like he'd go to casinos and you see,

233
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:16,740
you know,

234
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,060
the,

235
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,350
the preponderance of Asian
people gambling is crazy.

236
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:20,791
Yeah.

237
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:21,160
And

238
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,210
the way that it's set up,

239
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:23,500
the way the casinos are set up,

240
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:24,100
like they've,

241
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,780
they've had like the MGM,

242
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,260
like they used to have a
lion like near the door.

243
00:06:29,261 --> 00:06:31,150
Like you would like go
through the lion's mouth,

244
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,670
let Asians like fuck that.

245
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,140
They don't think lions are cute.

246
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,041
Cause you know,

247
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,090
a lot of Asian countries,

248
00:06:37,091 --> 00:06:39,280
big cats kill people on a regular basis.

249
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,970
And they were so not into
walking through the lines.

250
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:42,600
Oh yeah,

251
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:42,741
no,

252
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:44,720
there's a lot of funkshway type stuff.

253
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:45,554
About the luck,

254
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,160
you know,

255
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,010
it's bad luck to have red
next to this and yeah,

256
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:51,980
so they have all these consultants come
in to make sure that it's Asian friends.

257
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,410
Isn't that hilarious?

258
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,221
We got,

259
00:06:54,221 --> 00:06:54,671
should we got,

260
00:06:54,671 --> 00:06:55,361
should we got you.

261
00:06:55,361 --> 00:06:56,590
I understand sir.

262
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,270
You know,

263
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,750
you're not being irrational.

264
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,111
No,

265
00:06:59,111 --> 00:06:59,944
you're not.

266
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,250
You're your fear of the number five or
whatever the fuck it is and you're not

267
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:04,300
supposed to use,

268
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,590
you know,

269
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,020
like literally if they
see like certain numbers,

270
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:09,370
it's bad luck and you kind of keep,

271
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:09,510
keep

272
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,650
track of all that shit.

273
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:11,581
Meanwhile,

274
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:13,770
like if you want to get the
American gamblers and just like,

275
00:07:13,771 --> 00:07:14,604
what are we going to do?

276
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,230
Free drinks,

277
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,453
godly.

278
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,560
That should be completely illegal.

279
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,730
The idea that they can boost you up
while you're risking your money and that

280
00:07:23,731 --> 00:07:28,731
there's a benefit in giving you alcohol
for free as long as you're gambling.

281
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:29,940
Right.

282
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,451
So,

283
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:30,820
cool.

284
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,653
What a,

285
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,050
what a rude way to go about business.

286
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:34,441
Well,

287
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:36,420
you make me get high when
I do your podcast though.

288
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,620
That's not work though.

289
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,750
This is fun for us.

290
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,584
Christ fragments.

291
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,590
He's not bad.

292
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:42,860
You know,

293
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,050
it's the only time I ever smell good.

294
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,380
It's perfect time.

295
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,520
Why fuck around,

296
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,061
you know,

297
00:07:48,061 --> 00:07:48,301
the,

298
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,134
um,

299
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,950
the uh,

300
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,020
casino in Connecticut,

301
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:53,890
I just did that won Foxwoods.

302
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,600
So yeah.

303
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,320
And it's like,

304
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,220
I swear to God,

305
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,200
there is more and more of
those little bumper cars.

306
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,340
Every time he got those little scooters
people get on and I start to wonder,

307
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:03,174
like I,

308
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,050
how often do you see one of those in
real life and then you go to a casino and

309
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:08,640
every third person is on one.

310
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,863
What's that?

311
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,200
People that are not
making the best decisions.

312
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,280
Yeah.

313
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,380
It draws them those,

314
00:08:16,381 --> 00:08:16,770
um,

315
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,450
things are all over Disneyland too.

316
00:08:18,451 --> 00:08:18,930
I mean,

317
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,750
some of it is people just
whatever they got health problems,

318
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:26,310
but other ones that just looked like
people that are just fucking lazy fuckers.

319
00:08:26,311 --> 00:08:26,791
The south part,

320
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,190
I think a South Park episode about that.

321
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:28,890
It's really funny.

322
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,580
Really.

323
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,170
Everyone in the Cartman got one.

324
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:32,551
Well,

325
00:08:32,551 --> 00:08:35,040
my friend went to Disneyland and uh,

326
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,203
he had,

327
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,010
he'd hurt his hip but the hip was better,

328
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,870
but he asked for one of those carts,

329
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,380
front of the line on every
ride with his family.

330
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,760
Why there's a little tip.

331
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:47,050
If you're going to Disneyland
and they don't have to,

332
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,440
you don't have to bring
a note from the doctor.

333
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:49,921
You just,

334
00:08:49,921 --> 00:08:50,970
you just wear it like a,

335
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,950
like a by an ace bandage at a,

336
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:53,784
at a rite aid,

337
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,601
one of those velcro.

338

Thanks for your,

339
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:55,491

341
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,800
really bad Karma Joe.

00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,060
You know he had weed there the whole term,

343
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,920

344
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:01,963
Oh yeah.

345
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,890
Don't know if it's rolling
papers right there.

346
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,493
Right next to your honor.

347
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,960
When I was a grinder.

348
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,130
Yeah.

349
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:08,700

351
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,053
I'm not that talented.

352
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,720
We're supposed to be doing commercials.

353
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,300

354
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,570

00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,750
Everything is awesome.

363
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,531
And uh,

364
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:31,100
that's it.

365
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,720
Do it.

366
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,100
Okay.

May 5th,

378
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,880
we're going to COBB's comedy
club in San Francisco.

379
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:50,680
So a tickets are available at desk squad.

380
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:50,831
Dot.

381
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:51,430
TV.

382
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,180
Powerful.

383
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,950
Greg Fitzsimmons is in the house.

384
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,150
Start the music,

385
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:56,763
let the party.

386
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,193
Well,

387
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:03,660
the Joe Rogan experience
Joe Rogan podcast all day.

388
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,050
Hello powerful.

389
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,330
Greg Fitzsimmons is,

390
00:10:11,331 --> 00:10:11,870
uh,

391
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,770
we're here today for anybody who might
be listening to this in the future.

392
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,210
The Boston marathon
explosion happened yesterday.

393
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,730
It happened right before the podcast,

394
00:10:22,731 --> 00:10:24,770
I think before the one we did yesterday.

395
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:27,470
We didn't really talk about
it on the podcast yesterday.

396
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:27,920
Um,

397
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,360
cause I,

398
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,720
I didn't really know what happened.

399
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:32,510
I was still sort of trying to take
it in and try to figure out what,

400
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:33,470
you know,

401
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,030
pay attention to what
the store was saying.

402
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:35,900
Um,

403
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,760
but Greg and I,

404
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:38,390
uh,

405
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,080
essentially started out our comedy
together and Boston almost like the same

406
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,470
week.

407
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,490
And Greg's going back there this
weekend right after the bombing.

408
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,703
Yeah.

409
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,610
It's a very,

410
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:49,444
uh,

411
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,220
yeah,

412
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,730
I have very mixed feelings about it.

413
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:51,971
You know,

414
00:10:51,971 --> 00:10:52,791
obviously going back,

415
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:53,260
I haven't been,

416
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,170
I haven't worked in Boston and years and
I've been looking forward to this date

417
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:57,100
so much.

418
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,760
And then this thing happens yesterday
and your first thought is like,

419
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:01,594
how,

420
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,100
how do you go be funny?

421
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,121
And then you say,

422
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,710
well that's not really the hard part.

423
00:11:05,711 --> 00:11:09,850
I the the easy part is the people that
are going to shell up this weekend need a

424
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:10,300
laugh.

425
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:10,570
Yeah.

426
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,470
And are there for that.

427
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,360
What's awkward is to do,

428
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,400
to talk about it before you go.

429
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:16,631
You know,

430
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:17,051
it'd be like,

431
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:17,231
Hey,

432
00:11:17,231 --> 00:11:18,130
come out and see me.

433
00:11:18,131 --> 00:11:21,850
Because a lot of people probably have
bought tickets and I talked to the club

434
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:23,110
and refunds are available.

435
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:25,630
If you're not up for coming
out to a comedy show,

436
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,930
it's understood them in.

437
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,440
And if you feel like getting together,

438
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,630
maybe get your mind off
it for a little bit.

439
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,260
We'll be,

440
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,180
we'll be at Nick's this weekend and uh,

441
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,590
making the best of it.

442
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:35,981
Yeah.

443
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:36,311
That's,

444
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:37,120
um,

445
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,953
um,

446
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,370
I'm glad you addressed it.

447
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:39,920
A Grad,

448
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,890
you put it out there
like that to let them,

449
00:11:41,891 --> 00:11:42,430
let them,

450
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,030
you know,

451
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,841
let them stay home.

452
00:11:43,841 --> 00:11:44,674
I don't know the answer.

453
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,190
That's,

454
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,521
I mean,

455
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:48,220
I think you have to do that right
when something like this happens,

456
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:49,240
it seems like a,

457
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,400
to try to pretend it's
just a regular week.

458
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,690
I had a regular show.

459
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,940
You bring it up on stage,

460
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,020
you

461
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,660
think?

462
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,380
I think that,

463
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:55,950
um,

464
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,251
you know,

465
00:11:56,251 --> 00:11:58,110
this is obviously going to be a
couple of comics on ahead of me.

466
00:11:58,111 --> 00:11:58,531
I'll see.

467
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:00,030
I'll see what they do and see,

468
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,260
uh,

469
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,170
you know how that feels.

470
00:12:01,171 --> 00:12:02,100
But I don't know.

471
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,930
And I remember after nine 11 I went on
probably maybe a week after nine 11 and I

472
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:09,210
remember just this feeling of like,

473
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,860
these fucking people were so hungry to
laugh and get their minds off stuff that

474
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:14,731
it just felt,

475
00:12:14,731 --> 00:12:17,580
I felt gratitude that I could do that,

476
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,510
that in my job,

477
00:12:18,511 --> 00:12:19,291
that's what I do.

478
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:23,250
And I didn't feel like they've
been listening to pundants
talk about it all day.

479
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,840
And I think that people listen to,

480
00:12:24,841 --> 00:12:27,750
whether it's a minister
or their favorite athlete,

481
00:12:27,751 --> 00:12:28,584
people say,

482
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:28,951
you know,

483
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:29,784
moving things.

484
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,560
I didn't feel like my place then was
to be moving and I think my place this

485
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,560
weekend is to be a clown that takes
your mind off it for a little while.

486
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:40,651
Yeah.

487
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:42,120
That's a great way of looking at it.

488
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:42,580
You know,

489
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,413
are Ya,

490
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,030
but I think,

491
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:45,361
you know,

492
00:12:45,361 --> 00:12:47,220
for whatever reason
you have to address it.

493
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,840
I don't think you reverse without either.

494
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:49,763
Right.

495
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,700
It is what it is.

496
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,650
I think it's all about like right now,

497
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:52,920
uh,

498
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,450
what you just said would help people.

499
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,493
Right,

500
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,130
right.

501
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,210
Just it's okay to,

502
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,320
it's okay to laugh,

503
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,573
you know,

504
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,060
there's some really nice chemical
things that happened when you laugh.

505
00:13:03,061 --> 00:13:05,990
There's all this tension that sits inside
of you when an event like this happen,

506
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,250
because we don't know how to,

507
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,450
what's the angle on it?

508
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:09,990
Right now we're,

509
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,850
we're in the virgin
territory of the story.

510
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:12,684
There's no like,

511
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,040
this person fucked up.

512
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,300
This agency should have done that.

513
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,380
None of that's out there.

514
00:13:16,381 --> 00:13:16,541
Yeah.

515
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,710
Right now it's just
pure shock and sadness.

516
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,220
Yeah.

517
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,390
As far as what the,

518
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:21,780
you know,

519
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,460
for the future for anybody listening.

520
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,510
No one knows anything.

521
00:13:24,511 --> 00:13:25,590
It just happened yesterday.

522
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:27,150
There's no suspects.

523
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,870
They like saw a guy with a hood
apparently and someone had a van.

524
00:13:30,871 --> 00:13:32,000
They were there.

525
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:32,550
What's that?

526
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,700
Yeah,

527
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,820
they're looking for that black guy.

528
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:35,280
It's supposedly a nice sweatshirt,

529
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,610
black sweatshirt and black hat that tried
to get into an area he wasn't supposed

530
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:41,280
to be in five minutes prior
before the bomb blew up.

531
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,323
Oh yeah.

532
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,000
So that's the right thing to do
to saw a girl with a fat ass.

533
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,680
I need to get back to let her
know she forgot her thing.

534
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:50,730
I got stay right here.

535
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:52,441
Yo.

536
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:54,990
He owe me $5 let me get
back there real quick.

537
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,953
Talk to that girl.

538
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,061
Like Boston.

539
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:57,894
Not always.

540
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,760
Always tough to be a
black person in Boston.

541
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:00,870
Just got a little tougher.

542
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,280
It's a racist God damn town.

543
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,170
You see this kid?

544
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,010
That's a great town,

545
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:05,820
but it's racist.

546
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,850
The kid that went to boy that died like
a year ago had like this sign that says

547
00:14:08,851 --> 00:14:10,890
no more hurting people
or something like that.

548
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,700
So sad

549
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,730
fucking craziness,

550
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,564
man.

551
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,940
Two is to juxtapose.

552
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,770
I mean I'm not,

553
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,311
I don't know about you.

554
00:14:23,311 --> 00:14:25,380
I went to the Boston marathon every year.

555
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:30,240
It's like the most moving thing to see
people that like no matter who you are,

556
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:31,830
it was a struggle to finish that race.

557
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:35,170
And for some people it was a
phenomenal journey of you know,

558
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,420
overcoming things,

559
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:36,870
right?

560
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,820
And you stand there and you watch
people cross the finish line.

561
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,990
It's like elation.

562
00:14:39,991 --> 00:14:43,110
It's like this pure free high
that you get just watching it.

563
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,430
And then to think that that,

564
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:49,790
that could happen in that same place
just like that and change all those

565
00:14:49,951 --> 00:14:51,890
feelings and it feels like,

566
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,461
you know,

567
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:55,610
for it to be possible that
something like that happen.

568
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,340
It means they never anticipated
something like that happening.

569
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,090
You know,

570
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,390
for someone to be able to plant bombs
and they don't have security there,

571
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:05,090
they don't have the whole
area's t sketched out.

572
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:05,480
They don't,

573
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,190
they don't know who's been in and out.

574
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,080
They're not doing it Israeli style.

575
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,530
Right.

576
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,240
If you're not doing it Israeli style,

577
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:12,320
you're not going to find down.

578
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,550
And that's where things get really crazy
in this country because it starts to

579
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:17,750
bring up the,

580
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:18,410
um,

581
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,830
the ideas about how much
privacy do you really need?

582
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,790
How much privacy do you get to keep when
you're in a situation where people can

583
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:26,870
just plant bombs,

584
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,273
you know,

585
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,630
that gets really sketching.

586
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,360
People worry about
losing their ability to,

587
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:32,900
uh,

588
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,261
you know,

589
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:38,090
to just go through life and not be
intruded upon constantly because,

590
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:38,781
you know,

591
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:41,960
now we have to look everywhere because
people were willing to do things like

592
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:42,231
this.

593
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:45,380
People are so fucked up that
they're willing to blow up.

594
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:47,360
Nice folks watching people jog.

595
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,740
So now,

596
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,873
now what do we do?

597
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:50,341
Well,

598
00:15:50,341 --> 00:15:51,031
it depends.

599
00:15:51,031 --> 00:15:51,301
I mean,

600
00:15:51,301 --> 00:15:53,010
what's the ends of that?

601
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:55,890
Is it that we want to prevent
it in the future events?

602
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:56,830
The people that did it?

603
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:56,930
Yeah,

604
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:57,740
both.

605
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,640
You want to prevent it.

606
00:15:58,641 --> 00:15:59,750
You want to catch the people who did it.

607
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,930
You want to be able to read everybody's
email because one guy might have an

608
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:03,320
email,

609
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,420
the,

610
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:03,591
hey,

611
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:05,300
meet me at the docks
with the dynamite at two.

612
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:06,890
I'm blowing that fucking Boston marathons,

613
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,670
Scott High.

614
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,391
You want that guy?

615
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:09,081
He's got that email.

616
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:11,360
I sent it out there and I
could see that argument.

617
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:11,631
You know,

618
00:16:11,631 --> 00:16:12,590
I can totally see it.

619
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:13,581
You know,

620
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:13,840
I'm uh,

621
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,201
I'm,

622
00:16:14,201 --> 00:16:17,330
I'm the biggest proponent of free speech
and the biggest proponent of civil

623
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:18,164
liberties.

624
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,280
I think he's not the biggest,

625
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:20,114
but you know what I'm saying,

626
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,210
a little hype hype,

627
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,360
a little hyperbole or exaggeration,

628
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,400
but I think that when you
have a situation like this,

629
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:30,110
it really does beg the question,

630
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,100
what do you do?

631
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,000
Like are you,

632
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,440
you have to stay within the rules.

633
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,750
Did you find that person?

634
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:36,070
I don't think there are rules right now.

635
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:40,010
I mean after the Patriot Act and
the further erosion of civil rights,

636
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,920
civil rights since then,

637
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,120
you've really got a situation now where
if you don't think that the FBI is

638
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:49,510
tracking language on
everyone's emails and you know,

639
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,530
they will say it,

640
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:50,981
you know,

641
00:16:50,981 --> 00:16:51,814
there's no,

642
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,110
this isn't covert.

643
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:57,340
They say that if you write bomb
and a al Qaeda in an email,

644
00:16:57,341 --> 00:16:59,110
it's going to get flagged and
someone's going to read it.

645
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,770
I did a joke about archive them.

646
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,210
Damn it fucking bombed.

647
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,300
Kind of like comedy.com
is going to blog about it,

648
00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:10,120
which is even worse.

649
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:10,980
We're paraphrasing

650
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,300
sing,

651
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,240
but he was saying essentially
something about al Qaeda bombing,

652
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,103
right?

653
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,990
We're paraphrase.

654
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,640
Well that's the problem with stand up
is like Louis C k just got shit for you.

655
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,580
Do you see a special,

656
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,410
I haven't seen anyone came out and he,

657
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:23,460
I guess there's some heat.

658
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,323
I just saw it.

659
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,960
Some gay groups said because he was
talking about pedophiles and he made a gay

660
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:31,440
voice that it's like this big fucking,

661
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,220
you know,

662
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,580
deal now what's a gay voice?

663
00:17:35,581 --> 00:17:36,060
Really?

664
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,020
It's like this,

665
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,041
but why?

666
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:38,230
Why?

667
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,063
Why is it,

668
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,060
why is that a game?

669
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:44,860
Because it's so gay because we've heard
a million guys like that and we're

670
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:47,020
pretending that there's not a voice.

671
00:17:47,021 --> 00:17:49,620
I'm glad that they get
upset at the gay boys

672
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,270
rather upset about,

673
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,920
they're upset that it is a correlation
between gay and pedophilia,

674
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,630
which is probably not,

675
00:17:57,631 --> 00:17:59,100
it's probably no more,

676
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,480
there's no causality there.

677
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:02,880
There's no more instances
of gate pedophilia.

678
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,230
Then there is a straight pedophilia.

679
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:04,860
Really.

680
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,250
Right.

681
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,320
It's across the board
even exactly the same.

682
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,183
Well,

683
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:08,980
that's interesting.

684
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,813
My family,

685
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,860
I may look outside.

686
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,330
Um,

687
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,163
but getting,

688
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,990
but getting back to the whole,

689
00:18:20,991 --> 00:18:21,450
uh,

690
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,230
civil,

691
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,501
I mean,

692
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,630
I really do think that,

693
00:18:24,631 --> 00:18:25,464
uh,

694
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,820
in the big picture,

695
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:29,910
how do you stop people from bombing?

696
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,610
I,

697
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,850
one of the things is how the
media handles these stories.

698
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:33,361
Like I said,

699
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:34,650
there's no angle on it right now.

700
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,340
There's,

701
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:35,790
there's a,

702
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:39,900
a nation coming together in a city coming
together to try to heal and to try to

703
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:41,310
understand and,

704
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:41,551
uh,

705
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:41,790
the,

706
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,630
by the media finding stories that aren't
there and stirring it up and keeping

707
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,950
this at 24,

708
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:48,120
seven news story,

709
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,170
it gives lunatics us a prize.

710
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,430
And I think we have to be more careful
about that than about trying to snoop and

711
00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:57,264
people's emails.

712
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:57,571
Yeah,

713
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:58,620
that's certainly true.

714
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,610
That's certainly true.

715
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,533
And the,

716
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,050
we also have a real mental
health problem in this world,

717
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,570
and the,

718
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,170
the,

719
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,390
the fact that we can
develop humans like that,

720
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:11,790
that are capable of just killing
a random groups of people,

721
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,010
just a jumble of them together,

722
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,970
just in order to elicit some sort of
reaction to give them some sort of a burst

723
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:18,804
of excitement.

724
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,360
The fact that we're capable
of producing humans,

725
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:24,810
but there also were capable of producing
a great Fitzsimmons at the same time

726
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,790
during the same era like man,

727
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:27,020
like,

728
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,853
oh,

729
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,440
how does,

730
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,370
how do we fix that?

731
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,400
How do we figure out a way to
stop before anything ever happens?

732
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:38,730
All these people that are
capable of doing disastrous,

733
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:42,210
horrific things like that because not
everybody's capable of doing that,

734
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:43,044
right?

735
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,000
It's like who are these the mean?

736
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,000
They must be so far removed from normal.

737
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,290
People have to know.

738
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,970
That means someone has to know.

739
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,400
I really do think are the,

740
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,600
if you look at that Connecticut situation,

741
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,770
you had a guy who was an
outcast who felt unheard,

742
00:19:58,771 --> 00:19:59,640
unseen,

743
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,790
and I think that you aggravate
that to the nth degree.

744
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:06,120
That's the person that's going to go out
there and try to make some crazy noise.

745
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,530
And I think that in the advent
of a digital environment
where you don't have to

746
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:11,580
interact with people,

747
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,970
people are going to get lost in the matrix
and they're going to more and more of

748
00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:19,250
seek violent ways or not.

749
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,041
Not necessarily,

750
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,290
but I mean I'm overstating it,

751
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:27,291
but it does feel like people are going
to get more and more hermit like and,

752
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:32,610
and I think that that can lead to these
kind of expressions of rage and using

753
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,890
more hermit life because of the Internet.

754
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:35,401
Is that what you're saying?

755
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,080
I think that's the
direction that kids are had.

756
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:39,990
I think a kid who normally might've
been called it quote unquote nerd,

757
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,990
still went to the playground and
still played on a sports team.

758
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,690
It's still interacted
more with other kids now,

759
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:46,524
that same kid,

760
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,700
he comes from school and he will just
interact on websites and through video

761
00:20:50,701 --> 00:20:51,534
games and,

762
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:56,190
and I think that there's less and less
of a forced interaction with other people

763
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,180
in a healthy way.

764
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:01,240
I think that's very important for
development for kids getting involved in

765
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:01,931
activities,

766
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:04,060
whether it's band or sports or uh,

767
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:04,750
you know,

768
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,010
being a drama club.

769
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:09,940
Like anything where you were involved
in activities other than just school.

770
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,210
Right.

771
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,610
And doing things where you're
interacting with people.

772
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:13,301
You know,

773
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:14,500
like for most kids,

774
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:16,690
their day is interacting
with people in school,

775
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:21,490
wherever it is telling you to be quiet
and pay attention to them for almost the

776
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:21,520
whole day.

777
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,700
You're taking these
like really hyperactive,

778
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,520
bursting with energy vigils and you
just fucking poisoning them with a seat,

779
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:28,691
crashing them,

780
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:30,400
crushing their dreams with Shitty,

781
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:32,410
boring crap to pay attention.

782
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:33,250
Memorize.

783
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,201
Yeah.

784
00:21:34,201 --> 00:21:37,950
I mean I've just watched pink Floyd
the wall again recently and Holy Shit,

785
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,790
man,

786
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,110
it's all about that.

787
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:41,160
It's just about how,

788
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:41,970
you know,

789
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:42,781
if you,

790
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:43,020
you,

791
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,170
the only way to win is to not
follow the rules eventually.

792
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:46,940
And uh,

793
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,140
but,

794
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,950
but I think that the,

795
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,783
the kids that,

796
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,643
um,

797
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:50,461
again,

798
00:21:50,461 --> 00:21:52,500
nerds used to have play
dates with each other,

799
00:21:52,501 --> 00:21:55,170
they would meet up and their moms would
drop him off and they were awkward.

800
00:21:55,171 --> 00:21:56,430
A lot of meb low,

801
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:56,761
you know,

802
00:21:56,761 --> 00:21:59,490
low end Asberger's or
even add or whatever,

803
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,550
learning disabilities that made it
more difficult for them to socialize.

804
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:07,551
But they did and now they
are just interacting over
the internet and that's not,

805
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,290
that's not healthy.

806
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,710
So it's probably not the disassociation,

807
00:22:13,711 --> 00:22:14,544
right,

808
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,580
that whatever it is that allows people
to go out and just do violence in the UN,

809
00:22:20,811 --> 00:22:23,760
a mass group of just random
people just start killing them,

810
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,200
no connection to them.

811
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:25,711
Right.

812
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,230
And snipers or whatever it is.

813
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:27,551
Well,

814
00:22:27,551 --> 00:22:28,570
and also they're saying,

815
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,081
again,

816
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:32,500
this is the very early stages of
us knowing anything about this,

817
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:33,420
but that they used a,

818
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:38,620
a pressure cooker and some simple shrapnel
type material and that you could get

819
00:22:39,161 --> 00:22:39,430
it on.

820
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,690
You could have gotten that on Google.

821
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,310
You could look that up in.

822
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,230
Anybody can look that up in three seconds.

823
00:22:44,231 --> 00:22:46,180
How to make that exact bomb.

824
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,760
So it's not just these people
that are alienated and,

825
00:22:49,761 --> 00:22:50,471
and you know,

826
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:53,110
angry and obviously a psychotic,

827
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,640
but um,

828
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:59,670
the ability to assemble things that
didn't exist 2030 years ago is there for

829
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:01,840
anybody that wants it.

830
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:03,480
Yeah.

831
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,140
It's not,

832
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,050
it's not hard at all to figure
out how to make weapons.

833
00:23:07,051 --> 00:23:11,910
You can actually get three d plans to
make guns online now for three d printers,

834
00:23:11,911 --> 00:23:13,380
then making plastic guns.

835
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,540
Oh Shit.

836
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,021
Yeah.

837
00:23:15,021 --> 00:23:16,670
They only could fire a few times.

838
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,713
I think.

839
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,700
All you need and they start breaking and
this plastic guns they're making on a

840
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:22,534
fucking printer.

841
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:23,110
Yeah.

842
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,350
I said,

843
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,310
do you control that?

844
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,300
I think we internet,

845
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,840
I think we need to start
investing in shields and armor.

846
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,540
Then I think we need to
go back to gladiator style
because that's getting worse

847
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,680
and they're the only thing you could do.

848
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:34,060
It's protect yourself better.

849
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:34,601
You know,

850
00:23:34,601 --> 00:23:35,980
like we need the force fields,

851
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:36,814
we eat well you need,

852
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,450
you know,

853
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,283
chain armor.

854
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,450
If you had a walk around
everywhere with a shield,

855
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:46,550
just a giant hunk of
metal strap to leather

856
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,490
and it's on your forearm and everywhere
you go and you've got a big hunk of

857
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:49,990
metal.

858
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,220
Like that's how fucked up life used to be.

859
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,190
They used to have to
like have a big plate.

860
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:55,421
Yeah.

861
00:23:55,421 --> 00:23:56,890
Between you and the world.

862
00:23:56,891 --> 00:23:59,290
Anytime you don't forget,

863
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,260
they were onto something and Capes,

864
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:03,750
you know,

865
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:08,750
make it an arm or your whole body is
covered with metal walking around must be

866
00:24:10,571 --> 00:24:11,230
so heavy.

867
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:11,620
I mean,

868
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:16,180
how the fuck did those guys move and
go to war with all that shit on start

869
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,050
selling it and on it?

870
00:24:17,051 --> 00:24:17,590
Man,

871
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,880
they probably be so strong.

872
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:22,720
And then you look at those movies where
they have these five minutes sword

873
00:24:22,721 --> 00:24:23,920
fights with that Shit on David.

874
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:24,591
Oh my girl.

875
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:26,500
That sword wants it
somebody and it's like,

876
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,573
all right,

877
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,400
you win sorts of probably
mean how much does it weigh?

878
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,230
30 pounds and be pretty fucking heavy.

879
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,250
Probably like 20 to 30 pounds and that
shape it's probably super awkward.

880
00:24:36,251 --> 00:24:36,940
Right.

881
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,600
You know?

882
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:37,750
Yeah.

883
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,710
But what a workout.

884
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,790
Walking around with armor,

885
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:40,990
holding swords,

886
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,853
protecting your kids,

887
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:43,711
the sword around.

888
00:24:43,711 --> 00:24:45,030
That's a serious workout.

889
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,260
Just walking.

890
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,710
How much do you think this shit,

891
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,601
a suit of armor way.

892
00:24:48,601 --> 00:24:49,434
So let's guess before we,

893
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:53,080
I would probably say a
hundred to 150 pounds.

894
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,220
175 pounds.

895
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,500
Thank you.

896
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,333
Probably about right.

897
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,313
What do you think?

898
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,920
It's closer to 70 it depends on
what era we're talking about.

899
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,180
Oh,

900
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,190
I'm talking like the sexy armor.

901
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,570
Like the big clunky,

902
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,040
big English.

903
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,903
Yeah,

904
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,223
yeah,

905
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:08,680
yeah.

906
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,830
Like King Arthur type shit.

907
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,430
Yeah.

908
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,460
I liked the face mask.

909
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:15,090
That makes a loud noise when you cry.

910
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,303
Yeah.

911
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:16,690
Yeah.

912
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:17,523
Right.

913
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,780
Can you imagine?

914
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,530
How could you really hit
somebody with that sword tale?

915
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:22,931
Did you?

916
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:23,830
Four miles an hour.

917
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,111
Wow.

918
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:24,561
It's a lot.

919
00:25:24,561 --> 00:25:25,970
A lot lighter than I thought.

920
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,030
Did you have to poop in those or did
they have like a little buck shit

921
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:30,350
themselves or its sword fights,

922
00:25:30,351 --> 00:25:30,801
man.

923
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:33,060
Don't worry about smell like
poop and someone swam a story.

924
00:25:33,061 --> 00:25:33,620
Your head.

925
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,460
It's an advantage.

926
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,220
Shit yourself and keep swinging a,

927
00:25:37,221 --> 00:25:37,491
okay.

928
00:25:37,491 --> 00:25:38,324
So here's the answer.

929
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,050
Um,

930
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:39,883
the um,

931
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,570
classic harness of plate armor from the
late 14th through the mid 16th century,

932
00:25:44,571 --> 00:25:47,270
varied in weight from 20 kilograms,

933
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:49,870
which is about 45 pounds
up to 32 kilograms.

934
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,170
So about 65 pounds.

935
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,250
That's exactly the same way as my
Prius in the same way as my cock,

936
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,320
depending on the exact date.

937
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:02,650
Earlier armor from the 13th and 14th
centuries was heaviest as it included,

938
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,240
uh,

939
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,010
a full,

940
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,000
I don't know how to say this.

941
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:05,870
H A U.

942
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,320
B e r k Hoover.

943
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,000
Hubert.

944
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
How Burke Halberg Halberg of mail
chain mail weren't worn underneath.

945
00:26:13,491 --> 00:26:14,324
Yeah,

946
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,500
that's the stuff I'm talking about.

947
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:15,760
Yeah.

948
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,890
So they wore the chain mail and then
the more the the armor over email,

949
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,213
um,

950
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,200
I'm trying to,

951
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,580
chain mail is like the thing you
Paul in front of your fireplace.

952
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:25,763
Yeah.

953
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,913
I think that's,

954
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:27,850
I think curtain.

955
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:28,210
Yeah.

956
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,880
I think what they're saying
is that's the heaviest.

957
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,010
But the chain mail must be heavy too.

958
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,990
Well that's a part of that whole sexy
armor that I think of when you're,

959
00:26:36,991 --> 00:26:37,150
hey,

960
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:37,990
you're not thinking of it like that,

961
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,760
you know,

962
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,710
cone in armor where it's just like
protecting his boobs or whatever,

963
00:26:41,711 --> 00:26:41,930
you know?

964
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:42,763
Yeah.

965
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,100
So it seems

966
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,960
like they tried to keep it under,

967
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:46,740
uh,

968
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,910
under a hundred pounds.

969
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,280
They got up to like 65 pounds.

970
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:53,070
How did anybody ever die in that shit?

971
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,220
Now,

972
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,510
even if you lost the fight,

973
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,703
what's the goal?

974
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,320
Why do I feel like that's bullshit?

975
00:26:58,321 --> 00:27:01,570
I feel like answers.com just
fucked my answers.com it,

976
00:27:01,571 --> 00:27:03,540
that's Jesus as gay brother.

977
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,080
It just seems like they
would be heavier than that,

978
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,330
doesn't it?

979
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,940
When you see those suits that
someone has in their house,

980
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,990
especially when you know,

981
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,853
those are pretty dope.

982
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,330
Put any other layers of
it and then you know,

983
00:27:16,331 --> 00:27:16,901
underneath that,

984
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:17,171
you know,

985
00:27:17,171 --> 00:27:19,470
they're wearing like a burlap body suit.

986
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,071
Okay.

987
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,030
Here's a serious question.

988
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,380
Is there a guy that has ever existed that
has a full suit of armor in his house

989
00:27:25,381 --> 00:27:26,580
that isn't a douchebag?

990
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:28,843
Nope.

991
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:29,420
Well,

992
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:29,780
I mean,

993
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,120
comic book collector guys
aren't really Douche bags.

994
00:27:32,121 --> 00:27:32,331
You know,

995
00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:33,350
they like that shit.

996
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:33,820
You know,

997
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,010
like they have like what would they
have like a real suit of armor in their

998
00:27:37,011 --> 00:27:37,340
house.

999
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,530
I've almost bought it an
armored helmet the other day.

1000
00:27:39,531 --> 00:27:40,640
I saw helmets.

1001
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,720
Helmets are Kinda dope.

1002
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,021
Yeah.

1003
00:27:42,021 --> 00:27:43,490
I almost bought one of
those so I could see it.

1004
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,470
I would say last case I would say,

1005
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:45,901
uh,

1006
00:27:45,901 --> 00:27:49,250
the same could be said about
those dime store a Indians.

1007
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:50,360
Oh,

1008
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,193
cigar story

1009
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,950
or the black jockeys that
you put on your lawn.

1010
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:01,120
How about people who have like
little gremlins and shit on there?

1011
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,170
The elves,

1012
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:04,490
you know,

1013
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,323
what do they call him?

1014
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,730
My Step Mama Housing East
on her front porch today.

1015
00:28:07,731 --> 00:28:08,630
If it starts to rain,

1016
00:28:08,631 --> 00:28:09,790
she puts a rain coat on it.

1017
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:10,910
And then if it's like Halloween,

1018
00:28:10,911 --> 00:28:12,410
she dresses up in a little costume.

1019
00:28:12,411 --> 00:28:14,750
It's like this big ceramic geese.

1020
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,660
And then I,

1021
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,250
I was,

1022
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,210
I always make fun of it.

1023
00:28:17,211 --> 00:28:20,690
And then somebody came broke it
recently and she was so sad about it.

1024
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,960
So now she has all these stupid geese
outfits and she can't find another one of

1025
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:24,350
them.

1026
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,183
So see,

1027
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,513
are you kidding me?

1028
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,213
Ceramic.

1029
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,750
What happened today?

1030
00:28:34,751 --> 00:28:36,700
It was the worst day of my life.

1031
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:42,210
Someone cracked my and McBeard
how you had that one that I leave.

1032
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,100
It makes me so happy.

1033
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:46,360
I come home,

1034
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,070
I see my several hammock duck.

1035
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:54,550
I got him into Toronto world fairy 62
it's x and they don't make them that much

1036
00:28:56,451 --> 00:28:56,990
anymore.

1037
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,190
He's beauties.

1038
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,183
Oh,

1039
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,190
he defined my yard.

1040
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,740
I swear you still look at me.

1041
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,720
He was my friend.

1042
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:08,580
I know that sounds retarded.

1043
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,300
I don't care.

1044
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,330
He was my friend

1045
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,000
ever since he left.

1046
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,290
Ever since Jimmy left,

1047
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,590
he's gone.

1048
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,680
Oh,

1049
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,690
since he's gone.

1050
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:20,160
A house is haunted.

1051
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,220
I visited.

1052
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:22,591
He's gone.

1053
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:23,880
I feel a little crazy.

1054
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:27,600
I can't sleep at night cause I feel like
I failed him and he's going to kill me

1055
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:28,530
in my sleep.

1056
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,413
I should've,

1057
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,850
I should've gotten them a cota armor.

1058
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,870
It was my little Chally.

1059
00:29:34,871 --> 00:29:39,871
I had a name for forum Charlie
the duck and now he's dead.

1060
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,110
I had

1061
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,050
illustrated books I made
about him over the is

1062
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,640
he's going to come back and
kill those pumps and broke them.

1063
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,160
Those fucking punks.

1064
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,680
Stephen King movie about a
fucking evil ceramic duck.

1065
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,740
That's some good.

1066
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,600
Some kids break.

1067
00:29:55,601 --> 00:29:58,070
It goes out and cuts their
throat and their sleep.

1068
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,130
Just imagine that you wake it
up and a giant ceramic doc.

1069
00:30:01,131 --> 00:30:02,490
I just try to throw it out.

1070
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,441
Oh I,

1071
00:30:03,441 --> 00:30:03,850
I,

1072
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:04,470
I can,

1073
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,320
I'm never going to get tired of seeing
the neighborhood punks get beat up for

1074
00:30:07,321 --> 00:30:08,970
doing something wrong somehow.

1075
00:30:08,971 --> 00:30:09,730
You love that

1076
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,060
stores.

1077
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:15,060
Now that book isn't that like the most
scary time of like being a young man is

1078
00:30:15,641 --> 00:30:17,350
like dealing with other young men,

1079
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,330
especially like guys that are like 14
1516 when you don't know what the fuck

1080
00:30:22,331 --> 00:30:25,210
you're doing and you're all
like one up at each other.

1081
00:30:25,211 --> 00:30:27,610
Each person is doing the more stupid
than you think we're here with.

1082
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:28,444
Mike did

1083
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,023
Crazy.

1084
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,820
Yeah.

1085
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,790
That's the worst thing
you feel invincible,

1086
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:37,740
young boys without supervision or the
most fucking dangerous things and that's

1087
00:30:37,741 --> 00:30:39,990
why the worst is that
there's no fucking jobs.

1088
00:30:39,991 --> 00:30:40,830
When I was that age,

1089
00:30:40,831 --> 00:30:41,580
I was working,

1090
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,600
I was caddying all summer and the winter
time I was like shoveling snow and

1091
00:30:45,601 --> 00:30:47,970
fucking painting and then you know,

1092
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,250
now they just hang.

1093
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,880
That's a very good point.

1094
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,051
You know,

1095
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:52,381
and they,

1096
00:30:52,381 --> 00:30:54,840
and they don't feel good about
themselves because they're not producing

1097
00:30:54,841 --> 00:30:55,231
anything.

1098
00:30:55,231 --> 00:30:58,290
So then all of a sudden
like try not doing drugs.

1099
00:30:58,291 --> 00:30:59,820
I was working and doing drugs.

1100
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,230
Take the work away.

1101
00:31:01,231 --> 00:31:02,820
How would have been way more fucked up.

1102
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,260
Yeah.

1103
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,093
God.

1104
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,600
So you have martial arts,

1105
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:07,321
that's all.

1106
00:31:07,321 --> 00:31:10,530
I had doses that saved me for sure.

1107
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,250
Oh,

1108
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:16,110
I got so lucky if I didn't get obsessed
with that and I just kept hanging around

1109
00:31:16,111 --> 00:31:17,400
with all their kids I
was hanging around with.

1110
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,060
Right.

1111
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,280
Who knows what kind of crazy
show could we got into?

1112
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,150
I think marijuana helped me the most
because I would smoke marijuana with my

1113
00:31:23,151 --> 00:31:23,481
friends.

1114
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:27,470
Like 15 and we would just try to make
funny tapes up and do things that were

1115
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:28,940
funny because we were stoned.

1116
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:29,481
Right.

1117
00:31:29,481 --> 00:31:29,691
You know,

1118
00:31:29,691 --> 00:31:32,840
so we were like trying to do Frank Zappa
type kind of recordings and things like

1119
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:33,230
that.

1120
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,060
Right.

1121
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,620
The trouble it getting stoned
too much as a teenager,

1122
00:31:36,621 --> 00:31:37,700
especially a young teenager,

1123
00:31:37,701 --> 00:31:40,820
is total emotional under development.

1124
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:41,390
Yeah.

1125
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,230
It's a really,

1126
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,461
I mean,

1127
00:31:43,461 --> 00:31:44,370
no offense Brian.

1128
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:44,500
No,

1129
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:44,750
no.

1130
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,060
I mean if I wasn't doing that,

1131
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,650
I agree with you 100%.

1132
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,193
Right.

1133
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:53,680
Totally right.

1134
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:53,960
No,

1135
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,710
he'll admit it.

1136
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,310
Yeah,

1137
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:55,791
totally right.

1138
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:56,120
I mean,

1139
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:56,440
my,

1140
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:56,721
my,

1141
00:31:56,721 --> 00:31:58,430
all my senses went to art though,

1142
00:31:58,431 --> 00:31:58,720
you know,

1143
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,620
instead of like learning
about history and crap,

1144
00:32:00,621 --> 00:32:01,131
I was just like,

1145
00:32:01,131 --> 00:32:02,480
how can I make something cool?

1146
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,473
Right.

1147
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:04,011
Well,

1148
00:32:04,011 --> 00:32:04,850
it all worked out.

1149
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:05,990
Yeah.

1150
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,500
Yeah.

1151
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,011
Fuck yeah,

1152
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:07,191
man.

1153
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:10,220
We're all of us made it sound like he
got a suit of armor and your living room.

1154
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:12,921
Yeah.

1155
00:32:12,921 --> 00:32:13,191
These,

1156
00:32:13,191 --> 00:32:13,520
uh,

1157
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:13,971
fuck man.

1158
00:32:13,971 --> 00:32:15,020
I had friends that died.

1159
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:18,140
I had one guy jumped from a
rooftop to another rooftop,

1160
00:32:18,141 --> 00:32:19,910
fell and landed on his head.

1161
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,873
Yet Jesus,

1162
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,730
we had another guy who was,

1163
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:23,250
uh,

1164
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,010
got into a fist fight with another dude,

1165
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,680
knocked into a coma dead.

1166
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,900
The other guy shot himself,

1167
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,590
uh,

1168
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,290
shot himself with a shotgun
and other guy was in a car,

1169
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,071
put the,

1170
00:32:34,071 --> 00:32:34,340
uh,

1171
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,520
put a tube from the exhaust
pipe and it was car.

1172
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,210
I mean it's not a big town I grew up in,

1173
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,420
but it was just fucked up.

1174
00:32:39,421 --> 00:32:40,380
There's a lot of drugs.

1175
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,660
It was just a lot of intense.

1176
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,163
Great.

1177
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,900
That's so common everywhere.

1178
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,910
It's so common everywhere with young boys.

1179
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,420
Yeah.

1180
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:48,871
Like I said,

1181
00:32:48,871 --> 00:32:49,651
I avoided all,

1182
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:53,640
but I got super lucky
from the time I was 14 on,

1183
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:56,580
I was just completely
immersed in martial arts,

1184
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,730
so I'm,

1185
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,090
I barely part of the,

1186
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,170
barely hung out at barely socialized.

1187
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,250
Did you feel like,

1188
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,100
cause kids either feel cool or not cool.

1189
00:33:06,101 --> 00:33:10,120
Did you sort of feel not judged one way
or the other because you had something?

1190
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,253
Um,

1191
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,880
I definitely never felt cool.

1192
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,900
I was always insecure.

1193
00:33:13,901 --> 00:33:16,960
Even when I was really good at
something like martial arts,

1194
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:19,030
even though that was like the
first thing I was really good at,

1195
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,900
I still would get super nervous if I go
to talk to someone at a bank and then I

1196
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:23,770
go to a bank teller.

1197
00:33:23,771 --> 00:33:24,550
I get nervous.

1198
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,650
I was getting in fist fights
and I wouldn't get nervous,

1199
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:30,340
but talking to a bank teller
and stumble over my words,

1200
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,174
you know,

1201
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:31,711
I just,

1202
00:33:31,711 --> 00:33:31,820
yeah,

1203
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,081
I was,

1204
00:33:32,081 --> 00:33:33,160
I was definitely insecure.

1205
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:34,840
I think every kid is,

1206
00:33:34,841 --> 00:33:35,081
you know,

1207
00:33:35,081 --> 00:33:35,471
the kids,

1208
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,700
the kids that aren't are idiots.

1209
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:37,331
If you're,

1210
00:33:37,331 --> 00:33:38,164
if you're not,

1211
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:38,511
like,

1212
00:33:38,511 --> 00:33:42,130
if you don't look at the entire
possibility of life in front of you,

1213
00:33:42,131 --> 00:33:44,470
the entirety of the possibilities,

1214
00:33:44,471 --> 00:33:48,700
the massive amount of things
that can or might happen,

1215
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,270
not having any idea whether or not
you're proceeding in the right direction,

1216
00:33:52,271 --> 00:33:53,200
not having any idea.

1217
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,550
If you don't get paranoid,

1218
00:33:54,551 --> 00:33:56,120
if you don't get freaked
out looking at that.

1219
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:56,770
If you don't like,

1220
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,210
you start thinking about,

1221
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:58,900
you know,

1222
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,470
how small a piece you play in this little
thing and how do you figure yourself

1223
00:34:02,471 --> 00:34:03,490
out and how do you get through this,

1224
00:34:03,491 --> 00:34:04,120
right?

1225
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,800
If you don't feel uncomfortable,

1226
00:34:05,801 --> 00:34:06,760
if you don't feel insecure,

1227
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:07,594
you're an idiot.

1228
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,240
You should feel terrified.

1229
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:09,961
Yeah.

1230
00:34:09,961 --> 00:34:10,381
It was like,

1231
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,880
remember that movie high fidelity and uh,

1232
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,970
Phillip Seymour Hoffman was like the cool,

1233
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,121
uh,

1234
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:18,000
I think he was a radio announcer
and he said to the young kid,

1235
00:34:18,001 --> 00:34:18,810
he goes,

1236
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:19,590
the kids safe.

1237
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,730
I feel like I lose her.

1238
00:34:20,731 --> 00:34:22,470
I feel like a nerdy goes kid.

1239
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:26,550
Anybody who was cool growing
up never turned into anybody.

1240
00:34:26,551 --> 00:34:27,384
Interesting.

1241
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,080
It's so true.

1242
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,140
You got to suffer.

1243
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,133
Yeah.

1244
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,000
It's just reality,

1245
00:34:36,001 --> 00:34:36,570
man.

1246
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,231
Like you said,

1247
00:34:37,231 --> 00:34:38,064
there's no,

1248
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,430
there's no way to spin what you're going
through and what your head is trying to

1249
00:34:41,431 --> 00:34:45,450
absorb that that leads to
simple answers or security.

1250
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:46,703
Is it in funny

1251
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:51,820
when certain groups that are also
outsiders will decide whether or not one

1252
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:56,470
person or another is worthy of
being in the same outside of group?

1253
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,590
Like with standups,

1254
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,320
you get that like standups.

1255
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:05,340
I remember a guy seeing Nick Depaulo on
stage once Nick Depalo good looking guy,

1256
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,620
you know,

1257
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:06,891
big,

1258
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:07,461
rugged,

1259
00:35:07,461 --> 00:35:08,330
handsome guy,

1260
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,380
ex football player.

1261
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,930
So this was at stitches or at um,

1262
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,063
at uh,

1263
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:14,870
fuck.

1264
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,500
It wasn't,

1265
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,340
it wasn't stitches.

1266
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:16,671
Yeah,

1267
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:18,530
because it moved and
was the second stitches.

1268
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,430
I can't Mark Square.

1269
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:19,790
Yeah.

1270
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:20,541
And so he was,

1271
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:20,870
uh,

1272
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,210
he was on stage and the car
just like this is not for them.

1273
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,150
It's not a standup
comedy is not for jocks.

1274
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,013
Not for guys.

1275
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:28,610
Like meanwhile,

1276
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,800
Nikki Paulo's a better
comic than you'll ever be.

1277
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:32,100
Top

1278
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,990
10 comics of all time.

1279
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,520
Wildest imagination.

1280
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,253
He's not only a,

1281
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,560
I disagree with his politics to a fucking
detail and he's got the worst politics

1282
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,040
of all time.

1283
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,110
I also think he's my top 10 favorite car.

1284
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:46,501
You know,

1285
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:50,940
how much it takes to overcome disagreeing
with everything somebody thinks and

1286
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:52,230
still think they're that funny.

1287
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,200
He was always great.

1288
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,083
Oh,

1289
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,343
great writer,

1290
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:55,960
brilliant,

1291
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,740
brilliant.

1292
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,440
But this guy was upset that
he's too good looking right?

1293
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:02,320
Like nick was like a
good looking handsome.

1294
00:36:02,321 --> 00:36:03,610
He's Italian beef.

1295
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:04,750
He looked like a football player.

1296
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,870
I got that shit in in Boston.

1297
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,130
Not that I was big,

1298
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:12,390
but because I was white and
male and I was in college,

1299
00:36:12,391 --> 00:36:14,660
I was fortunate child and that,

1300
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:15,871
you know the story.

1301
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:18,540
I went to catch a rising star and
Cambridge and the guy that ran that place,

1302
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:19,410
Robin Horton,

1303
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,960
he sat me down and I
auditioned and he goes,

1304
00:36:21,961 --> 00:36:24,420
well I can either you didn't pass,

1305
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,500
you didn't pass into the club.

1306
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:25,861
He goes,

1307
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:28,940
I can either tell you just you
didn't pass or we can sit down.

1308
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:29,820
I can tell you why.

1309
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,200
So obviously I go,

1310
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:31,970
yeah,

1311
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:32,803
what the fuck?

1312
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,050
So we sit down and he goes,

1313
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,000
as far as I'm concerned,

1314
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,930
this is word for word,

1315
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:39,360
I'll never forget this
as far as I'm concerned.

1316
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,420
You're just another
cocky little Irish puke.

1317
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,933
I was like,

1318
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:49,680
what this supposed to be
from the liberal evolved,

1319
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,010
educated Cambridge Voice of good comedy.

1320
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:53,821
And I was like,

1321
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:56,220
that's like the most racist
fucking thing I've ever heard.

1322
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:56,850
Well,

1323
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:57,870
he had a thing,

1324
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:58,981
this guy,

1325
00:36:58,981 --> 00:36:59,850
who are you talking about?

1326
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,930
He was the,

1327
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:05,370
I would have to say like
the dictator of all,

1328
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,080
like all comedy,

1329
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:07,890
right?

1330
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:08,723
Andy Warhol.

1331
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,890
There was no alt comedy.

1332
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,580
Okay.

1333
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,880
All comedy be literally
began to cross comedy.

1334
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:15,151
Yeah.

1335
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:16,020
What David Cross,

1336
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,770
I mean there's a lot of people that
like to a attributed to various sources.

1337
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:21,630
I think it all started with cross cause.

1338
00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:22,890
Cross was actually funny.

1339
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:23,080
Yes.

1340
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,390
Said that a couple of weeks ago.

1341
00:37:24,391 --> 00:37:25,770
That's so funny that you say that.

1342
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,700
He was funny at it.

1343
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:27,990
He was doing what he wanted to do.

1344
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:31,650
He wasn't like some people were doing
things and you're watching them do it and

1345
00:37:31,651 --> 00:37:31,831
you go,

1346
00:37:31,831 --> 00:37:34,650
oh this guy's trying to be something
he's trying to put on something.

1347
00:37:34,651 --> 00:37:37,800
But Cross was a weird
guy and you get a weird,

1348
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:42,950
I remember he did a thing where he was
onstage and he played an exercise tape

1349
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,190
that started talking about stretching
and so he's going through all these

1350
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:49,680
stretches talking about
how he really feels it.

1351
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,120
Like where I really feel this.

1352
00:37:51,121 --> 00:37:52,110
I really feel like guys,

1353
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:52,951
and it was,

1354
00:37:52,951 --> 00:37:54,690
it was so odd and weird,

1355
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:58,470
but it was amusing and it was
amusing because he was enjoying it.

1356
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:03,960
It was like he had such a
brave way of taking these.

1357
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:05,820
Like he had these visions of what,

1358
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,530
what was interesting to
him and he would bring,

1359
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,480
I remember one time he would,

1360
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,570
he did like a four minute set without
saying anything and acting nervous and

1361
00:38:12,571 --> 00:38:16,620
then all of a sudden he just like lit up
and scream chicken donuts and the place

1362
00:38:16,621 --> 00:38:18,390
fucking laughed for like five minutes.

1363
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,830
And I can't explain why.

1364
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,320
I mean we've talked about
Andy Kaufman doing weird shit.

1365
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,880
Andy Kaufman did a lot of weird shit,

1366
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:24,600
but guess what?

1367
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,890
A lot of it wasn't funny.

1368
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,611
Sorry.

1369
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:27,670
Comedy nerds,

1370
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,760
pedestal going on stage and a sleeping
bag with an alarm clock and laying down

1371
00:38:32,761 --> 00:38:35,040
for five minutes on a Saturday night,

1372
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,390
catch a rising star.

1373
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,710
That's a great story.

1374
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,240
It's a horrible experience.

1375
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,070
If I paid 20 bucks to see that,

1376
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,540
I'd fucking tackle the guy.

1377
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,500
But Cross did weird conceptual
shit and it was funny

1378
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:50,590
and he did it all out of this
club that was run by this guy,

1379
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:55,591
Robin and Robin was like notoriously
ruthless and his assessment of comedians

1380
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,480
but often like way off the mark.

1381
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:59,111
Well,

1382
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:00,910
a lot of it was a reaction to that.

1383
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:05,770
Boston was so aggressive that the
guys that were successful were tough.

1384
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,740
Irish Catholic dudes from Southie,

1385
00:39:08,741 --> 00:39:09,491
Dorchester,

1386
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:12,520
and they were talking about gay drinking,

1387
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,091
uh,

1388
00:39:13,091 --> 00:39:13,790
you know,

1389
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,680
stocking about,

1390
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:15,640
you know,

1391
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,600
every fucking,

1392
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:17,680
you think Boston.

1393
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,720
And then this was a reaction to these,

1394
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:24,430
these other comics that were more esoteric
that couldn't really handle crowds,

1395
00:39:24,431 --> 00:39:25,090
that were,

1396
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,140
they had tasted blood,

1397
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,290
they had seen Don Galvin and they weren't
going to watch you guy scream chicken

1398
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:30,124
donuts.

1399
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,890
So they created this safe
place to develop these guys,

1400
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:33,724
which is great.

1401
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,110
It's just that the way he

1402
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,890
curated it was effective.

1403
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,403
Right.

1404
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,680
I had this in front of me,

1405
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:42,410
told me I was everything
that's wrong with comedy.

1406
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:48,643
I was like,

1407
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,553
everything.

1408
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,121
I don't even remember.

1409
00:39:51,121 --> 00:39:52,560
My bits couldn't be that bad.

1410
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,640
And you're so young,

1411
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,430
you just,

1412
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,270
this is a party.

1413
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,271
Oh my God,

1414
00:39:56,271 --> 00:39:57,104
he's right.

1415
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:57,770
Well,

1416
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,650
he wants to give you that feeling,

1417
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,070
right?

1418
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,360
He wanted to give you that feeling.

1419
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,590
He didn't want to say,

1420
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,550
you know,

1421
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,230
this is just not,

1422
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,850
not your place.

1423
00:40:07,851 --> 00:40:08,091
You know,

1424
00:40:08,091 --> 00:40:09,410
we're trying to do this here.

1425
00:40:09,411 --> 00:40:10,400
We're trying to do that here.

1426
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:10,851
You know,

1427
00:40:10,851 --> 00:40:12,740
I think you'd be better
off at another place.

1428
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,340
Right.

1429
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,360
He didn't have to say that.

1430
00:40:14,361 --> 00:40:14,600
I mean,

1431
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,110
he didn't,

1432
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,240
he didn't go say that.

1433
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,960
He said everything that's wrong.

1434
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:20,690
He's a,

1435
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:21,600
he's a bully.

1436
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,160
He was a real dickish guy.

1437
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:23,350
Well,

1438
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:27,240
there was the feeling among them that
comedy and comedy is a pretty big

1439
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:28,050
umbrella.

1440
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,580
Had to be a certain way,

1441
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,031
you know,

1442
00:40:30,031 --> 00:40:33,780
and that whatever it was that Lenny Bruce
did and with Carlin did and all that

1443
00:40:33,781 --> 00:40:37,320
needed to be protected from
what they saw going on.

1444
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,113
Hackery.

1445
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,260
Yeah.

1446
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:40,980
Shitty.

1447
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,790
Yeah.

1448
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:44,400
Well there was a lot of hackery there was,

1449
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,640
and if he was really trying
to promote originality,

1450
00:40:47,641 --> 00:40:48,270
right.

1451
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:51,870
But it was also just a scary
guy would yell at people.

1452
00:40:51,871 --> 00:40:52,704
He was big,

1453
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,900
big dues.

1454
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,810
It was intimidating.

1455
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,080
Right.

1456
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,200
We'd like to get the in your
face and like it wasn't,

1457
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,240
it wasn't handled very well.

1458
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,140
But I went back,

1459
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,060
I went back every three months.

1460
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,020
I auditioned again.

1461
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,011
He'd say no,

1462
00:41:05,011 --> 00:41:07,140
I'd go back for probably
a year and a half.

1463
00:41:07,141 --> 00:41:09,600
And then he passed me and
I started working spots.

1464
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,510
And like a year later he pulled me aside
and he apologized for treating me the

1465
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,530
way he did the first time.

1466
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,700
Wow.

1467
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:15,660
You remembered.

1468
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,230
Oh yeah.

1469
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,370
You didn't have to bring it up.

1470
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:17,970
No,

1471
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:18,301
I didn't.

1472
00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:19,111
I was over it already.

1473
00:41:19,111 --> 00:41:20,660
I didn't give a shit stereotype too.

1474
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:25,380
He put you into a box and decided to get
defined you and I just know I was like

1475
00:41:25,381 --> 00:41:25,921
you back then.

1476
00:41:25,921 --> 00:41:26,490
It was like,

1477
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,300
challenge,

1478
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,200
what do I need to do?

1479
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,850
I don't fucking quit.

1480
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,200
I just keep showing up,

1481
00:41:31,201 --> 00:41:31,741
showing up,

1482
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:32,574
showing up.

1483
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:32,940
You know,

1484
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,050
for some reason I had thick

1485
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:34,750
skin.

1486
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,583
Yeah,

1487
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,210
well you had a determination,

1488
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:37,810
you know,

1489
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:38,091
you,

1490
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:40,000
you had a determination to
make it and you're like,

1491
00:41:40,001 --> 00:41:40,720
look,

1492
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,021
you know,

1493
00:41:41,021 --> 00:41:41,190
you,

1494
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:41,411
you,

1495
00:41:41,411 --> 00:41:41,730
you,

1496
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,420
especially because you had
been friends with meaning,

1497
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:46,000
you kind of had a good
idea of the landscape.

1498
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:46,271
You're like,

1499
00:41:46,271 --> 00:41:47,590
this is not going to be easy.

1500
00:41:47,591 --> 00:41:50,650
You got to fucking dig your
heels in and keep moving forward,

1501
00:41:50,651 --> 00:41:53,110
but eventually you'll make it right.

1502
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:55,150
I remember you and I
like talking about it.

1503
00:41:55,151 --> 00:41:55,880
Like when were,

1504
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,580
you know,

1505
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,270
just doing open mic nights and shit.

1506
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,690
We're talking about making it,

1507
00:41:59,691 --> 00:42:00,170
it's like you,

1508
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:03,160
you're going to get through it all and
then one day you're going to get to that

1509
00:42:03,161 --> 00:42:08,080
spot and you're going to be a professional
one day and this will all be in the

1510
00:42:08,081 --> 00:42:08,914
past.

1511
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,281
You just,

1512
00:42:09,281 --> 00:42:10,810
it's just getting through it now,

1513
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,550
right?

1514
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,840
And all these little steps,

1515
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,940
you can't look at each one separately.

1516
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,430
You got to just the
next night you go bomb,

1517
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,420
you know,

1518
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,760
providence for no money and the
next night you don't have a spot.

1519
00:42:20,761 --> 00:42:21,810
So you go hang around a collab.

1520
00:42:21,811 --> 00:42:25,050
When you watch better comics and
you can't on any given night,

1521
00:42:25,051 --> 00:42:26,400
stop and look around and go,

1522
00:42:26,401 --> 00:42:27,390
what am I doing?

1523
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,490
You gotta just keep marching.

1524
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,101
Well,

1525
00:42:30,101 --> 00:42:35,101
it's also because you're a 21 year old
man at the time and when you're 21 you

1526
00:42:35,231 --> 00:42:37,540
don't have much time to like,

1527
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,190
you have to make a living.

1528
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,750
You're now out of the nest.

1529
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,141
Okay,

1530
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:41,950
you're on your own.

1531
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:42,560
And

1532
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,450
how much time do you have
to establish a career?

1533
00:42:44,451 --> 00:42:46,010
How much time do you
have to get things going?

1534
00:42:46,011 --> 00:42:46,131
Well,

1535
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:49,340
you don't have time to sit back and kick
back and relax and not make any fucking

1536
00:42:49,341 --> 00:42:51,500
progress like you got to get going now.

1537
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:55,010
Because if I'm going to bail out of
this comedy thing and get a real job,

1538
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:57,550
I don't want to be like starting out as,

1539
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:02,150
as a 27 year old who's given up on comedy
and now it's starting to pursue work

1540
00:43:02,151 --> 00:43:02,984
in the real world.

1541
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:03,860
Yeah.

1542
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,371
And they'll like,

1543
00:43:04,371 --> 00:43:05,204
what have you been doing?

1544
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:05,530
Oh,

1545
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:06,530
but trying to be a comedian.

1546
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:06,771
Oh,

1547
00:43:06,771 --> 00:43:07,640
just suck at it.

1548
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:08,503
You know?

1549
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:08,820
Oh,

1550
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,740
worse than saying I've
been in a coma for this.

1551
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:12,370
Well,

1552
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:13,510
I was trying to stand up,

1553
00:43:13,511 --> 00:43:14,510
but it just sucked at it.

1554
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:14,611
Well,

1555
00:43:14,611 --> 00:43:15,530
didn't you know you suck.

1556
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:15,890
Well,

1557
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,070
I thought it was going to get better.

1558
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:17,221
Oh,

1559
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:18,180
so you're delusional.

1560
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,380
That's not what I'm saying.

1561
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,601
Not only that,

1562
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:24,380
but who do you want around the office
less than a guy who thinks he's funny and

1563
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:25,223
isn't,

1564
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,570
he's trying to crack everybody
up at that morning meeting God.

1565
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:30,260
But it's,

1566
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:30,900
you know,

1567
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,640
it,

1568
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,990
it's just like the guys that still either
live at home because they're trying to

1569
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:37,250
make it or they have a,

1570
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,020
they have a day job that they,

1571
00:43:39,021 --> 00:43:40,820
that they won't give up
cause it's got good benefits.

1572
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,500
They're going to take longer to make it.

1573
00:43:42,501 --> 00:43:43,490
The guys that just say,

1574
00:43:43,491 --> 00:43:45,680
I'm going to live off this shit money.

1575
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,150
Because when you're that miserable,

1576
00:43:47,151 --> 00:43:47,990
you work harder,

1577
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,430
you push yourself harder,

1578
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:50,081
you got to,

1579
00:43:50,081 --> 00:43:52,070
you got to paint yourself
into a corner a little bit.

1580
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,300
Well you definitely have
to be uncomfortable and
that's something that people

1581
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:56,140
don't like to do,

1582
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:57,520
but in order to grow,

1583
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:58,900
you got to get uncomfortable.

1584
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:02,350
And there's a lot of people out
there that just don't want that.

1585
00:44:02,351 --> 00:44:04,570
They want to get as cozy as possible,

1586
00:44:04,571 --> 00:44:05,560
as warm as possible,

1587
00:44:05,561 --> 00:44:08,800
as quickly as possible and never
get anywhere because of it.

1588
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:12,310
And if you're trying to do something
as difficult as carving out a name and

1589
00:44:12,311 --> 00:44:13,240
standup comedy,

1590
00:44:13,241 --> 00:44:18,241
you're starting out from the open mic
circuit literally from ready go and you

1591
00:44:18,491 --> 00:44:23,491
want to get through this ridiculous idea
that you have that you're going to get

1592
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:27,790
paid to talk to people and you're going
to be able to tour the whole country and

1593
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:29,920
they going to pay to fly
you out from other places.

1594
00:44:29,921 --> 00:44:31,090
This is a ridiculous idea.

1595
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:31,980
You have to

1596
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,791
be a crazy person.

1597
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:36,090
I know sometimes now when I'm on the
road and I'll see an opening act and you

1598
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:41,091
find out that they're making like $150
for the weekend and like they've got no

1599
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:42,211
health insurance,

1600
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:45,270
they're living out of their car and
then you know what you're making and you

1601
00:44:45,271 --> 00:44:49,110
just think this is crazy
that I'm making this.

1602
00:44:49,111 --> 00:44:54,111
And that guy who's also on the same stage
also telling jokes is was making 150

1603
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:54,960
and you realize,

1604
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,381
oh yeah,

1605
00:44:55,381 --> 00:44:55,800
that's,

1606
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,790
that's where it starts.

1607
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:59,580
And somehow a few fucking hang in there.

1608
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,190
You can get to a point
that it seems absurd.

1609
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:02,731
Yeah.

1610
00:45:02,731 --> 00:45:03,630
And let's be honest,

1611
00:45:03,631 --> 00:45:05,900
most of those guys don't
deserve to get paid a nickel.

1612
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,003
Okay.

1613
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,110
They're lucky they're getting 125 bucks.

1614
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:09,791
No,

1615
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:12,370
but some are really good and
they're making shit money.

1616
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:13,400
That's part of the thing.

1617
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,990
They'll move up and they'll Marla thing.

1618
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:16,570
Yeah,

1619
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:17,131
and you'll,

1620
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:17,500
you'll be,

1621
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,550
might be really good for a month and
then you just fuck it up somehow.

1622
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:20,870
Right?

1623
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:21,703
You can't get it right.

1624
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:23,960
I believe it's a meritocracy.

1625
00:45:23,961 --> 00:45:26,120
I really believe that that standup comedy,

1626
00:45:26,121 --> 00:45:27,980
if you are good and you work hard,

1627
00:45:27,981 --> 00:45:31,280
you will move up period
because there's a need for it.

1628
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:32,143
Everybody,

1629
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:34,180
there's other guys that are moving
up and they're doing movies.

1630
00:45:34,181 --> 00:45:35,900
They're not doing standup guys die,

1631
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:40,820
guys leave and there's this constant
need to fill the comedy clubs around the

1632
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,350
country to fill,

1633
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:42,771
you know,

1634
00:45:42,771 --> 00:45:45,230
managers need new talent that
they can make money off of.

1635
00:45:45,231 --> 00:45:49,250
There is always there always looking
for that guy or that girl and it doesn't

1636
00:45:49,251 --> 00:45:50,180
matter what you look like,

1637
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:54,290
all that matters is that you've worked
hard enough to figure out what the fuck

1638
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:55,470
you need to do on stage.

1639
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:56,340
Yeah.

1640
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:00,790
To become an actual real professional
is such a long and arduous process.

1641
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:05,070
It was very few people that get through
it and once you find one that that can

1642
00:46:05,071 --> 00:46:05,940
actually work,

1643
00:46:05,941 --> 00:46:07,470
like you can plug them into your business,

1644
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:10,060
people are always going to be in
the business of live entertainment,

1645
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,730
even if it's just for their own enjoyment.

1646
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:16,680
For a lot of folks like that have a
lot of folks with clubs that own clubs.

1647
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,360
I mean they actually enjoy
live performance themselves.

1648
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,090
Guess they got into it as a,

1649
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:23,700
hopefully that they like it themselves.

1650
00:46:23,701 --> 00:46:26,490
If they got into it just
as a business venture man,

1651
00:46:26,491 --> 00:46:27,390
it's not a lot of those day.

1652
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:27,781
No.

1653
00:46:27,781 --> 00:46:28,281
It's like,

1654
00:46:28,281 --> 00:46:28,770
uh,

1655
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:30,270
do you work the Atlanta punchline at all?

1656
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:30,830
Yeah.

1657
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:31,663
Like that.

1658
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:32,250
Yeah.

1659
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:36,330
I mean that dude has had that club for
30 years and when I'm in town he comes

1660
00:46:36,331 --> 00:46:39,990
down and he'll watch two or
three shows hang out backstage.

1661
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:40,590
Meanwhile,

1662
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:41,580
he's managing,

1663
00:46:41,581 --> 00:46:42,414
um,

1664
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:43,080
uh,

1665
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,510
which is really cartel.

1666
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:44,720
He,

1667
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,150
yeah,

1668
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:46,650
he's a producer on that.

1669
00:46:46,651 --> 00:46:48,270
He's making so much fucking money.

1670
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,560
He doesn't need that club.

1671
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:50,670
He loves it.

1672
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,470
He loves it and that's
why it's a great club.

1673
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:53,980
It's a perfect setup to,

1674
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,530
and it's a time port.

1675
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:56,510
Like if you go in there,

1676
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:56,700
you'll,

1677
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,740
you like all of a sudden you're
back in like the 1970s right.

1678
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,990
Headshots you see like headshots literally
from the eighties and the nineties

1679
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:04,260
you're like,

1680
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,250
oh my God,

1681
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,050
there's something cool about those clubs.

1682
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:07,961
Like Nashville's,

1683
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:08,794
Amy's is like that.

1684
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:09,450
Well,

1685
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:11,940
all over the wall I took on my Instagram,

1686
00:47:11,941 --> 00:47:12,810
I was put all these pictures,

1687
00:47:12,811 --> 00:47:13,710
like one of them was Richard,

1688
00:47:13,711 --> 00:47:15,870
Jenny and all these different comics.

1689
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:16,741
A lot of them,

1690
00:47:16,741 --> 00:47:17,880
they're dead and gone,

1691
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:18,481
you know,

1692
00:47:18,481 --> 00:47:20,940
but that you're seeing them all laid out.

1693
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:21,450
The alcohol,

1694
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:22,560
I forgot about that guy.

1695
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:24,330
Whatever happened to that guy.

1696
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:26,970
And those old clubs like that,

1697
00:47:26,971 --> 00:47:29,600
like comedy works in
Montreal and other one,

1698
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:30,441
fuck,

1699
00:47:30,441 --> 00:47:31,450
I haven't been there in awhile.

1700
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:32,841
They're amazing.

1701
00:47:32,841 --> 00:47:33,590
Yeah,

1702
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:35,090
I just did that a couple of weeks ago.

1703
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:35,511
Yeah,

1704
00:47:35,511 --> 00:47:36,680
I mean back when we were in New York,

1705
00:47:36,681 --> 00:47:37,130
that was a,

1706
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:37,701
that was a hop,

1707
00:47:37,701 --> 00:47:38,331
skip and a jump.

1708
00:47:38,331 --> 00:47:39,800
You jump up there for the weekend,

1709
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:42,860
but now in La it's like
Montreal isn't really on the,

1710
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,630
that's not really on the tour anymore.

1711
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,051
No,

1712
00:47:45,051 --> 00:47:45,920
but I do a,

1713
00:47:45,921 --> 00:47:47,870
there's a lot of times
as a UFC and Montreal.

1714
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:48,261
Oh,

1715
00:47:48,261 --> 00:47:48,591
okay.

1716
00:47:48,591 --> 00:47:50,330
So I'll do that the night before.

1717
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,540
Craig town in general,

1718
00:47:53,541 --> 00:47:53,870
man,

1719
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,070
they're so nice up there.

1720
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:55,430
Right?

1721
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:56,263
Isn't it amazing?

1722
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:56,991
It is amazing.

1723
00:47:56,991 --> 00:47:58,550
And it's got different personalities.

1724
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:00,540
I think of Canada as a big block man.

1725
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,160
You go to Vancouver versus
Toronto versus Edmonton.

1726
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:04,520
Yeah.

1727
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:08,150
It's like the u s they're
totally different personalities.

1728
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:08,990
Very different.

1729
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:09,741
Very different.

1730
00:48:09,741 --> 00:48:11,090
It's a fascinating country.

1731
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:11,811
You know,

1732
00:48:11,811 --> 00:48:12,111
it's just,

1733
00:48:12,111 --> 00:48:14,630
it's weird how like across the board,

1734
00:48:14,631 --> 00:48:16,790
less douchey they are than Americans,

1735
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,110
but they're like right there.

1736
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:18,250
I mean,

1737
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,390
you're going to have your drunks
going to have your ass holes,

1738
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,990
but in general people like more relaxed,

1739
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,580
more friendly.

1740
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,171
It's,

1741
00:48:26,171 --> 00:48:27,200
it's very interesting.

1742
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:27,941
It is.

1743
00:48:27,941 --> 00:48:28,541
It's interesting,

1744
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:32,980
but it's almost like when you talked
about getting in and making yourself

1745
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:33,581
awkward,

1746
00:48:33,581 --> 00:48:36,550
being in an uncomfortable place
so that you can achieve something.

1747
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:38,650
The problem with Canadians is like,

1748
00:48:38,651 --> 00:48:42,820
you can't name more than two stand up
comics that are any good ever that came

1749
00:48:42,821 --> 00:48:44,060
out of uh,

1750
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:44,470
Canada,

1751
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:45,460
Harland Williams.

1752
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:46,241
Great.

1753
00:48:46,241 --> 00:48:47,074
Stand up.

1754
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:48,220
And um,

1755
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:50,103
who else?

1756
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:52,170
There's another great standup at a,

1757
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,110
at a Canada,

1758
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,353
Jim Carrey,

1759
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:57,263
Jim Carrey,

1760
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:59,580
but they do good sketch and all that,

1761
00:48:59,581 --> 00:49:00,780
but like that voice,

1762
00:49:00,781 --> 00:49:02,250
that singular voice,

1763
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,060
you know,

1764
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:05,700
calling out against the
status quo and you know,

1765
00:49:05,701 --> 00:49:09,350
raging and like that just doesn't
exist there because you know,

1766
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,220
I don't know if you want to call
it because it's social ties.

1767
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,690
[inaudible] it's too,

1768
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:13,200
I don't know.

1769
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,610
Cold should help that shit.

1770
00:49:14,611 --> 00:49:15,260
If anything.

1771
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:15,591
Yeah,

1772
00:49:15,591 --> 00:49:16,670
it helped in Boston.

1773
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:17,210
Um,

1774
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:17,451
yeah.

1775
00:49:17,451 --> 00:49:20,150
Maybe socialized medicine
maybe that fucked him up.

1776
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:21,081
Hate him.

1777
00:49:21,081 --> 00:49:22,400
Soft made soft.

1778
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,050
Who's today too nice up there

1779
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,391
too.

1780
00:49:24,391 --> 00:49:24,900
Nice.

1781
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:25,733
And the women,

1782
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,700
here's the amazing thing.

1783
00:49:26,701 --> 00:49:27,031
Women,

1784
00:49:27,031 --> 00:49:29,730
it's very European here in this country.

1785
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:31,260
Women don't want to admit it.

1786
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:32,940
They're fucking second class citizens.

1787
00:49:32,941 --> 00:49:35,010
They make 77 cents on the dollar.

1788
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,083
They are still,

1789
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:39,360
they still dress up like dirty whores
on the weekends when they go out,

1790
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,010
they objectify themselves.

1791
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:42,870
Canadian women are not like that.

1792
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,490
It's like on par,

1793
00:49:44,491 --> 00:49:46,230
men treat women like friends.

1794
00:49:46,231 --> 00:49:46,381
It's,

1795
00:49:46,381 --> 00:49:48,120
there's not this gender,

1796
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:49,050
uh,

1797
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:50,030
specific,

1798
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:50,400
uh,

1799
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,500
behavior up there that
you get in this country.

1800
00:49:52,501 --> 00:49:52,801
It's very,

1801
00:49:52,801 --> 00:49:53,600
it's very,

1802
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,500
it's very European really.

1803
00:49:55,501 --> 00:49:56,251
That's interesting.

1804
00:49:56,251 --> 00:50:00,160
I never noticed that 77
cents on the dollar still.

1805
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:01,651
Yeah.

1806
00:50:01,651 --> 00:50:04,890
But if you do believe in a meritocracy
as far as that concern or you think

1807
00:50:04,891 --> 00:50:05,820
there's a conspiracy?

1808
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:06,451
No,

1809
00:50:06,451 --> 00:50:09,030
that's what's interesting
to me is like there's laws,

1810
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:09,540
you know,

1811
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:09,960
cause that's,

1812
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:14,130
there's that book out called lean forward
by the woman that runs Yahoo or Google

1813
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:15,710
and,

1814
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:17,100
and she's saying,

1815
00:50:17,101 --> 00:50:19,080
you know what the fuck ladies,

1816
00:50:19,081 --> 00:50:22,890
the laws are saying you
can't pay us less and you,

1817
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:25,560
you have the same access to degrees.

1818
00:50:25,561 --> 00:50:26,311
And you know,

1819
00:50:26,311 --> 00:50:26,790
there's the,

1820
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,100
there's mothering thing,

1821
00:50:28,101 --> 00:50:29,330
there's the fact that
you'd have to mother,

1822
00:50:29,331 --> 00:50:31,550
but that's not as much of a
factor now is it used to be.

1823
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:36,790
So it's time for ladies to step up and
fight their way into the board room,

1824
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:38,510
fight,

1825
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:38,991
fight,

1826
00:50:38,991 --> 00:50:40,410
do whatever the fuck it takes.

1827
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:43,650
They think that women are too nice too.

1828
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:43,910
Yeah.

1829
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:44,620
That they're,

1830
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,970
they're team players and that they,

1831
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,420
they're lacking the skills that it takes
in a capitalist society to really get

1832
00:50:50,421 --> 00:50:51,180
to that next level.

1833
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,380
So they're being women.

1834
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:53,723
Exactly.

1835
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:56,670
And the in don't you like women?

1836
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:57,480
This is what I say.

1837
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,313
I like them.

1838
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,180
I like when they're nice and sweet.

1839
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,313
I liked him.

1840
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,420
I don't think they should
have to become men.

1841
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:07,260
And when they're doing the same
job as a man and you're like,

1842
00:51:07,261 --> 00:51:07,471
you're,

1843
00:51:07,471 --> 00:51:07,711
you're,

1844
00:51:07,711 --> 00:51:09,450
you're trying to call qualify.

1845
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:10,171
Well it depends.

1846
00:51:10,171 --> 00:51:12,330
It completely depends on
what kind of job is it.

1847
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:13,733
If it's,

1848
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,620
she's talking specifically
about white collar jobs.

1849
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:18,211
Yeah.

1850
00:51:18,211 --> 00:51:19,410
But it was a babysitting kids.

1851
00:51:19,411 --> 00:51:21,990
Would you rather have a man do
it or did you have a woman do it?

1852
00:51:21,991 --> 00:51:23,470
I would rather have a woman do it.

1853
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,980
Misses if it's for sure a woman do it.

1854
00:51:25,981 --> 00:51:28,080
But then are you generally stronger?

1855
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,090
They can do it better
even though it feels Kay.

1856
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:31,343
Um,

1857
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:34,290
if it's a to be a CEO,

1858
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:37,110
I guess whoever's really good at the job,

1859
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:37,620
you know,

1860
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:38,910
when it gets to something like that,

1861
00:51:38,911 --> 00:51:39,744
like the,

1862
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:40,830
I think a woman,

1863
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,930
like if you're dealing
in the business world,

1864
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:45,330
what could a woman not
do that a man can do?

1865
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:45,541
I mean,

1866
00:51:45,541 --> 00:51:46,140
what is,

1867
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,190
what is the difference there?

1868
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:48,990
The critical decision making skills.

1869
00:51:48,991 --> 00:51:49,141
I mean,

1870
00:51:49,141 --> 00:51:52,680
isn't that based on education experience
and how much focus you put into the

1871
00:51:52,681 --> 00:51:53,310
business?

1872
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,920
It seems to me that that shouldn't
be gender specific at all.

1873
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,091
Well,

1874
00:51:56,091 --> 00:51:56,870
I think a lot,

1875
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:59,030
a lot of mid management is still sales.

1876
00:51:59,031 --> 00:51:59,361
You know,

1877
00:51:59,361 --> 00:51:59,541
it's,

1878
00:51:59,541 --> 00:51:59,781
it's,

1879
00:51:59,781 --> 00:52:02,090
it's still the be the
ability to walk into a room,

1880
00:52:02,091 --> 00:52:03,230
slap somebody on the back,

1881
00:52:03,231 --> 00:52:04,550
tell him you're gonna take up golfing,

1882
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:05,301
you know,

1883
00:52:05,301 --> 00:52:06,640
bust their balls and,

1884
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:07,040
you know,

1885
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,050
make it feel like a boy's club.

1886
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,520
I don't tell a big thing.

1887
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:12,440
I don't have any experience in that world.

1888
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:13,970
I don't know anybody like that.

1889
00:52:13,971 --> 00:52:14,361
I don't,

1890
00:52:14,361 --> 00:52:16,130
I'll never drafted in that world.

1891
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:17,960
So I believe you well,

1892
00:52:17,961 --> 00:52:19,040
agents are kind of like that.

1893
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:19,810
Yes.

1894
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:20,391
A little bit.

1895
00:52:20,391 --> 00:52:21,410
I know what you're saying there.

1896
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:22,643
Yeah.

1897
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,031
Yeah.

1898
00:52:23,031 --> 00:52:23,191
They,

1899
00:52:23,191 --> 00:52:23,781
they work.

1900
00:52:23,781 --> 00:52:24,050
Yeah,

1901
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:24,501
the milk.

1902
00:52:24,501 --> 00:52:25,310
Yeah.

1903
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:26,690
And it's hard for female,

1904
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,700
you see female development executives,

1905
00:52:28,701 --> 00:52:32,000
probably more southern male development
executives and casting because it's,

1906
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:34,850
it is a team effort and it involves,

1907
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:35,743
um,

1908
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,090
I think an energy that's very,

1909
00:52:38,091 --> 00:52:39,320
that's not as Alpha.

1910
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,610
And isn't it interesting that if you're
in one of those situations with those

1911
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:48,880
backslapping buddy buddy
business situations and then
a woman is introduced into

1912
00:52:49,551 --> 00:52:53,210
it and the men behave the same
way that they always have,

1913
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,610
the woman can actually,

1914
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,040
especially if they're
cracking sexual jokes,

1915
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,400
the woman could be offended that
they have an altered their behavior,

1916
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,830
that they've enjoyed this weird,

1917
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,480
unprofessional in quotes,

1918
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:08,360
buddy buddy sort of fuck off relationship.

1919
00:53:08,361 --> 00:53:12,380
Like I took her clients out to the Strip
club and bought them steaks and you

1920
00:53:12,381 --> 00:53:12,831
know,

1921
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,910
we've got this account.

1922
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:14,923
You know what I mean?

1923
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:15,421
Well yeah,

1924
00:53:15,421 --> 00:53:16,680
but that's also,

1925
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:20,460
that's her acknowledging that women
should be treated differently than men.

1926
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:23,100
If she's got a problem with
them telling sexual jokes,

1927
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,700
then it's admission that there's
two different ways to behave.

1928
00:53:26,701 --> 00:53:27,180
There's you,

1929
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:27,841
I'm a woman,

1930
00:53:27,841 --> 00:53:30,720
you should behave differently
as opposed to her saying,

1931
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,441
cause you know,

1932
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:33,840
I mean a lot of the agents that uh,

1933
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,160
art,

1934
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,720
we both had the same agent
for a long time and she was,

1935
00:53:36,721 --> 00:53:38,850
she was at the Strip clubs with the guys.

1936
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:39,040
Yeah.

1937
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:39,810
And she was a guy,

1938
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:41,820
she was the one landing
all the big comics,

1939
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:44,490
getting all the big deals and
she was the one that could,

1940
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,470
she could hang people made sexual jokes.

1941
00:53:46,471 --> 00:53:47,640
She laughed harder than anybody.

1942
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:48,540
Did she go crazy?

1943
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,680
I'm not sure.

1944
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:51,800
I'm not sure.

1945
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,790
I think she might have went crazy.

1946
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:54,140
But the point is,

1947
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:55,611
it is.

1948
00:53:55,611 --> 00:53:55,850
Let's,

1949
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:57,670
my point is you can't do that very low.

1950
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,300
Your blow a fucking fuse.

1951
00:53:59,420 --> 00:53:59,920
Right.

1952
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,280
Well,

1953
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,940
it's not a natural female behavior.

1954
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:02,480
Um,

1955
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,880
but I see the woman's point of view too,

1956
00:54:04,881 --> 00:54:05,810
because if,

1957
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,320
um,

1958
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:06,951
let's say the would,

1959
00:54:06,951 --> 00:54:09,800
if that was your wife name is and my wife,

1960
00:54:09,801 --> 00:54:10,640
it was your wife.

1961
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,180
Okay.

1962
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:11,841
And you know,

1963
00:54:11,841 --> 00:54:14,600
she was working with a bunch of guys are
told a lot of sexual jokes and it was

1964
00:54:14,601 --> 00:54:15,440
just gross.

1965
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:18,370
I don't think my wife would mind
if they were directed at her.

1966
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:19,450
Then there's an issue.

1967
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:22,300
But of course it just happened
to be in the racial jokes.

1968
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:22,960
I don't know.

1969
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,190
My wife wouldn't give a fuck.

1970
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,570
Boy is they are really bad and gross
and that's inappropriate for anybody,

1971
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:29,140
right?

1972
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:29,511
I mean if,

1973
00:54:29,511 --> 00:54:29,751
if the,

1974
00:54:29,751 --> 00:54:31,060
if they do that to me,

1975
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,850
if I'm at a comedy club and some guy
comes up and he wants to tell a fucking

1976
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:35,410
racial joke in front of me,

1977
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:38,520
don't just say I say nigger because
that's what you wanted to say.

1978
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:39,800
Okay.

1979
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,281
How did you know?

1980
00:54:40,281 --> 00:54:41,114
I wanted to say,

1981
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,153
but really is the,

1982
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:51,110
that is the grossest moment ever when a
guy assumes you are racist and and drops

1983
00:54:51,111 --> 00:54:54,620
an end bomb and like looks at you
to see how are you going to react.

1984
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:57,510
And he puts you in a position where
because the people around him,

1985
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,620
they're okay with it.

1986
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,050
He wouldn't have said it if
it's five buddies run okay with.

1987
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:03,860
So now you're in a position
of being the minority it up,

1988
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:06,240
excuse the pond and saying,

1989
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:06,691
hey,

1990
00:55:06,691 --> 00:55:07,620
that's wrong.

1991
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:08,401
Don't like,

1992
00:55:08,401 --> 00:55:09,420
you're going to change him.

1993
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:10,620
You're not going to change him.

1994
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,490
So you,

1995
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:15,780
so then you got to suck it up and you
got to take that shitty feeling and just

1996
00:55:15,781 --> 00:55:15,991
go,

1997
00:55:15,991 --> 00:55:16,950
it's not worth it.

1998
00:55:16,951 --> 00:55:17,784
It's not worth it.

1999
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,530
Especially if it's not funny.

2000
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:20,983
Okay.

2001
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,113
Bad One.

2002
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:25,120
It's really funny and racist.

2003
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:25,811
I laugh.

2004
00:55:25,811 --> 00:55:26,471
I'm sorry.

2005
00:55:26,471 --> 00:55:27,370
I know it's not right,

2006
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:28,204
but I will laugh.

2007
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:28,541
Well,

2008
00:55:28,541 --> 00:55:28,931
there's a,

2009
00:55:28,931 --> 00:55:29,830
there's shades.

2010
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,290
There's sometimes people do it ironically,

2011
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:36,220
but you got to know them to know
that that's not how they feel.

2012
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:40,740
And they're saying it in a really making
fun of people that would make that yes,

2013
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:45,990
but when somebody is doing a straight
up racist joke and you don't know them,

2014
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:46,860
right.

2015
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,550
That to me is insulting to me.

2016
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:49,630
Neil Brennan,

2017
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:51,670
you ever hear Neal
Brennan's version of that?

2018
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,593
Now?

2019
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,131
Neil Brandon,

2020
00:55:54,131 --> 00:55:55,570
when he was doing the Chappelle show,

2021
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,440
um,

2022
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:01,060
apparently him and his friend started
doing this thing where whenever something

2023
00:56:01,061 --> 00:56:01,990
would be in the news,

2024
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:03,200
okay.

2025
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:03,380
He,

2026
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:04,700
they were blaming it on black people.

2027
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:06,350
So it'd be like,

2028
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:07,660
it'd be raining out here.

2029
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:08,600
It's fucking porn out.

2030
00:56:08,601 --> 00:56:09,920
He was fucking nigger.

2031
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:16,640
He claims down black people and
it became like this running gag.

2032
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:17,280
Okay.

2033
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,290
A Neil.

2034
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:20,780
Brian is probably the least racist
person in the face of the earth.

2035
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:20,950
Yeah.

2036
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:24,220
Not even remotely racist
and he's not serious either.

2037
00:56:24,221 --> 00:56:26,950
You fuck like to try to get upset at that,

2038
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:29,660
like anybody that would give
him shit about that is you.

2039
00:56:29,661 --> 00:56:30,494
You have to be a crazy

2040
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,110
personally and that shit all the time too.

2041
00:56:32,111 --> 00:56:33,280
I think that's very common.

2042
00:56:33,281 --> 00:56:36,820
People like calling your cat that and
the n word and stuff when no one's around

2043
00:56:36,821 --> 00:56:37,130
and like,

2044
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:37,963
you know,

2045
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,470
to call you Kathy,

2046
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:43,070
I used that word a lot at all.

2047
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:49,500
Me and animals and maybe I can imagine
if right after you drop an embalm,

2048
00:56:49,501 --> 00:56:51,900
the doorbell rings and
you know they heard it,

2049
00:56:51,901 --> 00:56:52,480
you open it.

2050
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,490
It's a black cop.

2051
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:54,030
Yeah,

2052
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:55,470
but I say funding wise,

2053
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:55,780
no,

2054
00:56:55,780 --> 00:57:00,360
no black cop thinks that that is a funny
word when you're talking and they're

2055
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:01,430
ringing your door.

2056
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:02,440
When I yell,

2057
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,870
Brandon's getting arrested at that point.

2058
00:57:03,871 --> 00:57:04,170
Right.

2059
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,260
Everybody's going did your aunt
used to call the gates and words

2060
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:09,003
colored

2061
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:14,320
yellow,

2062
00:57:14,321 --> 00:57:17,830
all the colors in this crazy fucking bed.

2063
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:20,440
He's a daddy Khaled bird.

2064
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:21,730
Cassock and lazy.

2065
00:57:21,731 --> 00:57:23,500
He hasn't moved from that spot.

2066
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:26,050
Joe,

2067
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:27,250
have you heard of the word dip?

2068
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,140
Follia I think it's called.

2069
00:57:29,141 --> 00:57:30,610
It's dip.

2070
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:33,850
H.

2071
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:33,850
A.

2072
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:33,850
L.

2073
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:33,850
L.

2074
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:33,850
I.

2075
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:33,910
A.

2076
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:34,720
What is it?

2077
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,670
It's when you're born with
two dicks and if there,

2078
00:57:37,671 --> 00:57:39,310
if you Google image search to that,

2079
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,840
it's amazing.

2080
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:44,140
Like there's guys were walking
to Dick's and it's the crazier,

2081
00:57:44,141 --> 00:57:44,680
it's real.

2082
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:45,170
Yes.

2083
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:45,520
It's,

2084
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,740
it's actually real of Google search.

2085
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:49,090
Just feel like a guy like
that would be famous.

2086
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:50,163
I know.

2087
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:51,130
No,

2088
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:52,450
that's exactly what I was thinking.

2089
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:53,733
Come on.

2090
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:55,750
How many balls?

2091
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:56,733
I don't know.

2092
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:57,430
I was,

2093
00:57:57,430 --> 00:58:01,270
I was just looking@itduringthestamps.com
commercial duplicate.

2094
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:02,560
DUPA wow.

2095
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:03,970
Duplication.

2096
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,500
Penile duplication.

2097
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:07,880
It makes perfect sense.

2098
00:58:07,881 --> 00:58:08,031
You're,

2099
00:58:08,031 --> 00:58:08,241
you're,

2100
00:58:08,241 --> 00:58:09,074
you're,

2101
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,420
you're Adams are all see
yourselves are all splitting.

2102
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,051
Oh yeah.

2103
00:58:12,051 --> 00:58:13,160
These guys have two dicks.

2104
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:14,053
Whoa.

2105
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:17,240
Dip Ophelia in my mouth party.

2106
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:18,710
If you could own that,

2107
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:20,330
you could have a really cool life.

2108
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,560
But if you,

2109
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:22,940
if you shy away from it,

2110
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:24,260
well I wouldn't have this miserable.

2111
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:26,000
Does one get hard to do?

2112
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,200
Either of them get hard,

2113
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:27,711
do both,

2114
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,850
get hard at the same time.

2115
00:58:28,851 --> 00:58:31,040
There's some important
questions there that you know,

2116
00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:32,750
because that would suck
if you had one hard mood.

2117
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:33,680
The other ones just dead.

2118
00:58:33,681 --> 00:58:34,580
You can even feel it.

2119
00:58:34,581 --> 00:58:37,430
And this was like a third ball
that once in a while dripped.

2120
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:39,710
I think it would be like two
rifles on a hunting trip.

2121
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:42,170
You use one and the other ready to go.

2122
00:58:42,171 --> 00:58:43,004
Ready to go.

2123
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:43,671
Yeah.

2124
00:58:43,671 --> 00:58:46,130
I would just be beaten off
while I was having sex.

2125
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:48,200
Oh double beating off with both hands.

2126
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:50,120
Oh some of these decks look scary.

2127
00:58:50,121 --> 00:58:51,680
Like it's like two heads.

2128
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:53,570
It's like one dick,

2129
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:55,160
but it's like a double wide.

2130
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,390
The best is,

2131
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:58,260
do you ever like have
an erection and you're,

2132
00:58:58,261 --> 00:59:02,000
you're having sex and you can't pop
because you have to go to the bathroom so

2133
00:59:02,001 --> 00:59:02,750
bad.

2134
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:05,960
Cause now you could take a leak
with one and keep fucking with you.

2135
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:07,143
Wow.

2136
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:09,020
Or just be on the girl
while you're fucking her.

2137
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:11,200
Don't do that dude.

2138
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:12,970
That's assault.

2139
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,621
People get sued.

2140
00:59:14,621 --> 00:59:17,320
It would be amazing having
sex with like in her ass.

2141
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:18,730
And her vagina at the same time.

2142
00:59:18,731 --> 00:59:19,800
If you could feel both of those,

2143
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:20,890
wouldn't be amazing for her.

2144
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,860
She put Jesus Christ bad enough,

2145
00:59:22,861 --> 00:59:25,040
this disgusting fuck sticks his penis,

2146
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:25,883
and one way

2147
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,720
that's you're less.

2148
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:30,620
She's a super freak and
she really loves you.

2149
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,560
It really depends on your relationships.

2150
00:59:33,561 --> 00:59:36,050
When I'm trying to say is working
or if they're functioning.

2151
00:59:36,051 --> 00:59:36,920
That's the big question.

2152
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,350
I'm not really worried about dude,

2153
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,160
the decks,

2154
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:40,911
not even a little.

2155
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:41,744
How about that?

2156
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,190
He checked out on this topic,

2157
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:44,403
done.

2158
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,670
There's the girl with the two vaginas,

2159
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:47,983
the girl,

2160
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:50,690
I think there's at least one
does one of them smell like shit

2161
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:59,130
because I know a few of those.

2162
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:03,573
That's the,

2163
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,210
that's how the whole,

2164
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:06,553
well,

2165
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:11,780
I know this woman who
has two uteruses really?

2166
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:15,510
She had the first baby in the first
uterus and that's when they discovered she

2167
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:16,020
had to,

2168
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:16,990
it was lodged in one.

2169
01:00:16,991 --> 01:00:20,790
She had to lay out horizontally for like
the last three months of her pregnancy.

2170
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:21,540
Wow.

2171
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:22,321
And then they said,

2172
01:00:22,321 --> 01:00:22,770
well,

2173
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:23,730
she wanted to get pregnant again,

2174
01:00:23,731 --> 01:00:24,061
and they said,

2175
01:00:24,061 --> 01:00:24,811
you should be fine.

2176
01:00:24,811 --> 01:00:26,340
It'll probably end up in the same one.

2177
01:00:26,341 --> 01:00:28,350
And you're good ends up in the other one,

2178
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:31,980
so she had to go like six
months laying down for that one.

2179
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:36,810
She had double like I forget there was
another organ also that she had a double

2180
01:00:36,811 --> 01:00:37,770
of inside of her.

2181
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:38,753
Oh my God.

2182
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,070
Crazy Double Oregon's tableau organs.

2183
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:45,360
I know this girl that has every
thing inside of her is reversed.

2184
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:48,540
The current hearts and everything like
this on the wrong side and says she has

2185
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:49,560
to wear this bracelet.

2186
01:00:49,561 --> 01:00:50,371
So if she ever,

2187
01:00:50,371 --> 01:00:54,150
you know like passes out and have
to do like refurbished or whatever.

2188
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:54,660
Yeah,

2189
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:55,270
they,

2190
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:57,060
they notice on the opposite side.

2191
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,470
You mean like her liver,

2192
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,120
everything.

2193
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,190
The left side of her body
and so the right side,

2194
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,190
everything is backwards.

2195
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:02,831
Yeah.

2196
01:01:02,831 --> 01:01:03,664
That's crazy.

2197
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:04,650
What is that called?

2198
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:05,513
I don't know.

2199
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:09,070
I've never heard of that
before and she from China.

2200
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:09,913
Crazy.

2201
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:11,800
That's crazy.

2202
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,000
Wow.

2203
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,470
That would really fuck
that would if you'd say,

2204
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:17,643
wow,

2205
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:21,030
I've never been heard of that die.

2206
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,830
How weird is it that the body
can be backwards like that?

2207
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,353
How is it?

2208
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:27,000
How weird is it that it's not,

2209
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:31,410
it's called Cyprus at that most bodies
are not completely fucked up and double

2210
01:01:31,411 --> 01:01:33,330
dicked and double vagina.

2211
01:01:33,331 --> 01:01:34,090
I mean it's,

2212
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:34,690
it's amazing.

2213
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:37,240
It's called situs in versus s.

2214
01:01:37,241 --> 01:01:41,680
I.

2215
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:41,680
T.

2216
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:41,680
U.

2217
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:41,680
S.

2218
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:41,680
I.

2219
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:41,680
N.

2220
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:41,680
V.

2221
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:41,680
E.

2222
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:41,680
R.

2223
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:41,680
S.

2224
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:41,680
U.

2225
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:41,770
S.

2226
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:42,221
Wow.

2227
01:01:42,221 --> 01:01:44,800
And is it dangerous at all
for the person who has it?

2228
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:45,131
I mean,

2229
01:01:45,131 --> 01:01:45,941
she seemed fine.

2230
01:01:45,941 --> 01:01:46,391
I think she,

2231
01:01:46,391 --> 01:01:47,790
I think I asked the doctor,

2232
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:49,150
I mean I asked her,

2233
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,650
I told him to cough.

2234
01:01:50,651 --> 01:01:50,921
She said,

2235
01:01:50,921 --> 01:01:51,131
yeah,

2236
01:01:51,131 --> 01:01:52,240
just everything's in reverse.

2237
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:57,370
No a health consequences for that.

2238
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:57,520
It

2239
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,570
doesn't seem like it.

2240
01:01:58,720 --> 01:01:59,553
Wow.

2241
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,600
I had sex with a girl
with three nipples wants.

2242
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:02,380
Oh yeah,

2243
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:03,430
I did it grow three norms.

2244
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,030
Really?

2245
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:04,420
Yeah.

2246
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,430
That's really common with a Russian,

2247
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:07,841
the third nipple,

2248
01:02:07,841 --> 01:02:09,360
it doesn't look good
cause there's no areola.

2249
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:10,900
So it's kind of a bullshit.

2250
01:02:10,901 --> 01:02:13,540
Like I almost went in here to get a
tattoo of aerial around it just to,

2251
01:02:13,541 --> 01:02:14,081
where to look.

2252
01:02:14,081 --> 01:02:14,650
Look,

2253
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:15,580
it looked like a little,

2254
01:02:15,581 --> 01:02:16,570
like a little,

2255
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:17,930
little pimple

2256
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:20,540
without the Areola,

2257
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:24,390
but she had to point it out to me before
we fooled around because it would have

2258
01:02:24,391 --> 01:02:25,140
come up.

2259
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:25,950
Wow.

2260
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,810
It was not like a mole or whatever.

2261
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:29,070
It was like a nipple.

2262
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:29,730
Yeah.

2263
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:30,181
This,

2264
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:30,570
uh,

2265
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:32,970
this girl I used to work
with on this TV show,

2266
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:38,040
this a guy that she was
dating for a while and before,

2267
01:02:38,041 --> 01:02:38,640
uh,

2268
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,630
she was dating him.

2269
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:43,320
The guy went on a date
with this agent and,

2270
01:02:43,321 --> 01:02:43,710
uh,

2271
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:48,090
they get back to the chick's house and
they start making out and he pulls her

2272
01:02:48,091 --> 01:02:53,091
pants down and she has a Taurus
that's like ridiculously enlarged,

2273
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:55,110
like a pinky.

2274
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:58,020
And she tries to explain to him,

2275
01:02:58,021 --> 01:02:58,471
she said,

2276
01:02:58,471 --> 01:03:01,320
I guess I should tell you about that.

2277
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:01,801
It's like,

2278
01:03:01,801 --> 01:03:04,500
I just had this really
just really long clip.

2279
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,311
I don't know what it is,

2280
01:03:05,311 --> 01:03:06,300
but it's not a deck.

2281
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,830
And the guy freaked out and made up some
story about forgetting that he had to

2282
01:03:10,831 --> 01:03:12,270
pick up his brother at the airport.

2283
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:14,760
Fucking ran out of there,

2284
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:17,170
like clip was so big that it's scared.

2285
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:18,393
Hermaphrodite.

2286
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:19,570
Um,

2287
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:20,130
I didn't,

2288
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:20,963
I was very,

2289
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:21,701
I was with the girl.

2290
01:03:21,701 --> 01:03:22,660
I told you this before,

2291
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:24,700
that when I would go down on her,

2292
01:03:24,701 --> 01:03:27,010
like it would stretch out
probably like six inches.

2293
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:29,080
So it felt like I was sucking on a dick.

2294
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:30,370
Just push your lips.

2295
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:31,240
That was a dude.

2296
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,073
That was it.

2297
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:33,660
I said it's,

2298
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:34,503
it's actually,

2299
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:36,490
it's stretched out pretty.

2300
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:37,091
I mean,

2301
01:03:37,091 --> 01:03:38,500
it was a lot of like,

2302
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:39,161
stretchy,

2303
01:03:39,161 --> 01:03:40,330
so bigger than most decks.

2304
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,600
I know it would stretch out that it
wouldn't be like that all the time.

2305
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:43,700
Oh,

2306
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:44,770
let's be real.

2307
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:46,420
Six millimeters maybe.

2308
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:46,631
No,

2309
01:03:46,631 --> 01:03:46,811
no,

2310
01:03:46,811 --> 01:03:47,021
it was,

2311
01:03:47,021 --> 01:03:47,470
yeah,

2312
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:49,120
it was like about that.

2313
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:50,230
That's so not

2314
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,130
going to get a bigger one.

2315
01:03:53,131 --> 01:03:53,680
It was hard.

2316
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:53,790
No,

2317
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:54,040
no,

2318
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:54,130
no,

2319
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:54,281
no.

2320
01:03:54,281 --> 01:03:54,821
It's just,

2321
01:03:54,821 --> 01:03:55,231
it wasn't,

2322
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:56,710
it was just the meat like the,

2323
01:03:56,711 --> 01:03:56,920
you know,

2324
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:57,790
you know what I'm talking about,

2325
01:03:57,791 --> 01:03:58,920
like the bubble gum stuff,

2326
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:00,040
but after it's shot,

2327
01:04:00,041 --> 01:04:00,611
come out of it,

2328
01:04:00,611 --> 01:04:02,080
did it start to get smaller again

2329
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:04,930
after it shaved his beard?

2330
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:07,781
But that's pretty common.

2331
01:04:07,781 --> 01:04:09,400
It's called an extended,

2332
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:10,090
uh,

2333
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:10,950
extended clip tours.

2334
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,520
I think it's so bad.

2335
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:13,570
[inaudible] that uh,

2336
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:17,300
were the girl rather had it so bad
that the guy just ran out of the room.

2337
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:18,320
Mm.

2338
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,280
Since she was hot too.

2339
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:20,473
She couldn't deal.

2340
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:21,981
It was so big.

2341
01:04:21,981 --> 01:04:22,814
It just,

2342
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:24,380
you're there,

2343
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:24,830
you're there.

2344
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:25,940
Well not only there,

2345
01:04:25,941 --> 01:04:28,010
but why would you make her feel so bad?

2346
01:04:28,011 --> 01:04:28,270
You know,

2347
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:31,520
you don't run out because their clits
a little too long for your Weirdo.

2348
01:04:31,521 --> 01:04:32,450
Just enjoy this other,

2349
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:33,100
it's pick it up,

2350
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:33,681
move it out of the way.

2351
01:04:33,681 --> 01:04:34,290
Like a towel.

2352
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:35,390
He probably thought it was a guy.

2353
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:36,883
Yeah.

2354
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:40,400
But that brings up the question of
hermaphrodites because you know,

2355
01:04:40,430 --> 01:04:41,060
it's uh,

2356
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:43,460
it is a technically not a clit.

2357
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:44,481
It is a very,

2358
01:04:44,481 --> 01:04:45,980
very small penis.

2359
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:47,360
Her Matt really is.

2360
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:48,080
Yeah.

2361
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:48,980
Well the both.

2362
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:50,210
They've both,

2363
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:51,043
yeah.

2364
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:56,330
Do you stop Brian over to you doing stop?

2365
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:57,800
I think you do.

2366
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:58,873
Yeah.

2367
01:04:58,940 --> 01:04:59,421
It stopped.

2368
01:04:59,421 --> 01:04:59,870
Yeah,

2369
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:00,703
definitely.

2370
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:01,843
Yeah.

2371
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:02,860
Stop and smile.

2372
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:03,051
Yeah.

2373
01:05:03,051 --> 01:05:04,230
You got to realize that.

2374
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:04,850
Stop.

2375
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:05,121
Yeah.

2376
01:05:05,121 --> 01:05:07,670
You're not supposed to have sex
with the guy that's also a girl,

2377
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:09,860
unless that's what you really into.

2378
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:15,800
But you've got to decide because if you
do fucker and it's the best sex ever.

2379
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:19,910
Cause also had a cock that's on you,

2380
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:20,450
right?

2381
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:21,141
That's on your head.

2382
01:05:21,141 --> 01:05:22,550
Now try chasing that dragon.

2383
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:23,990
Awesome.

2384
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:24,530
Also,

2385
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:27,170
she's the most defined
good human being ever.

2386
01:05:27,171 --> 01:05:31,280
So now you feel guilty that you
haven't done the right thing.

2387
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:35,450
Now would it would be her decision whether
or not she identified as a man or a

2388
01:05:35,451 --> 01:05:36,020
woman,

2389
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:36,800
right?

2390
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,030
If she was a Hermaphrodite,

2391
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:38,893
correct.

2392
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:39,981
Yeah,

2393
01:05:39,981 --> 01:05:42,110
she would shoot up or maybe not.

2394
01:05:42,111 --> 01:05:43,940
I think most identify as men.

2395
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:46,310
Maybe she would just go all buck angel on.

2396
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:46,820
Yeah,

2397
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:49,790
just identify as something
in the middle there.

2398
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:50,840
It's,

2399
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:51,051
you know,

2400
01:05:51,051 --> 01:05:51,611
Buck Angela.

2401
01:05:51,611 --> 01:05:52,190
Yeah.

2402
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:52,581
Don't know.

2403
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:54,800
Buck Angel was pull up buck angel.

2404
01:05:54,801 --> 01:05:57,540
Please try and find one of us.

2405
01:05:57,550 --> 01:05:59,900
All the Middlesex buck angels.

2406
01:05:59,901 --> 01:06:04,280
A used to be a woman and a
decided it really should be a man.

2407
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:05,121
So,

2408
01:06:05,121 --> 01:06:05,360
uh,

2409
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:09,530
started taking all these
different hormones and looks
like a big beefy man with

2410
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:11,960
a guy who would fight
for king of the cage.

2411
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:15,080
Not like the UFC for like
maybe gladiator challenge.

2412
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:17,143
Look,

2413
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:18,493
see that guy.

2414
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,360
All right.

2415
01:06:20,361 --> 01:06:21,860
Which one you want when
you want bunk buck.

2416
01:06:21,861 --> 01:06:22,694
Angel dating.

2417
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:23,360
Adult.

2418
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,550
Aspirational dating,

2419
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:25,443
dating,

2420
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,020
dating.

2421
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:29,150
But with hormone shots becomes a man.

2422
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:30,733
Oh,

2423
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:31,940
you have to register.

2424
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:34,101
No one's registered.

2425
01:06:34,101 --> 01:06:34,851
You don't want to be on that.

2426
01:06:34,851 --> 01:06:36,830
Let me get down there were over the,

2427
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,150
underneath the crown.

2428
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:40,070
That guy has a vagina.

2429
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:41,841
We look at,

2430
01:06:41,841 --> 01:06:43,540
he's built like a brick shit house.

2431
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:44,990
Big Kick Ass.

2432
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:46,550
Look next to you Greg.

2433
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:50,350
Here's the uncensored version now
over your left side right there.

2434
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:53,600
Wow.

2435
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:54,920
That's impressive.

2436
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:55,521
Yeah.

2437
01:06:55,521 --> 01:06:56,930
It's a big yoked up check,

2438
01:06:57,740 --> 01:06:59,090
but it's like still a check.

2439
01:06:59,150 --> 01:06:59,720
Yup.

2440
01:06:59,720 --> 01:06:59,961
You know,

2441
01:06:59,961 --> 01:07:00,950
he's in some weird,

2442
01:07:00,951 --> 01:07:02,780
strange mid life,

2443
01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:05,090
mid world sort of a thing.

2444
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:06,140
Is He,

2445
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:09,610
I guess he's transgender but not,

2446
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:10,221
you know,

2447
01:07:10,221 --> 01:07:10,420
it's,

2448
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:11,253
it's like

2449
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:15,200
it's a weird gray area,

2450
01:07:15,201 --> 01:07:15,561
right.

2451
01:07:15,561 --> 01:07:16,430
Because like until you,

2452
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:17,593
if a man,

2453
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:18,530
a woman,

2454
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:19,221
a man could come,

2455
01:07:19,221 --> 01:07:20,480
a woman pretty successfully,

2456
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:23,660
but a woman becoming a man
becomes a bit more complicated.

2457
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:25,910
And I think he's probably,

2458
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:27,020
you mean postop?

2459
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,010
I mean,

2460
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:28,700
how do you do,

2461
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,430
I don't know what they are doing
these days as far as penises.

2462
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:32,660
I'm not up on it.

2463
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:33,370
Yup.

2464
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:35,370
On this artificial pump up,

2465
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:36,290
uh,

2466
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:41,290
but the artificial penis and a male
to female or female to male rather.

2467
01:07:41,361 --> 01:07:42,194
I don't know why.

2468
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:47,000
You just pretty much pull that part
out the clit and you pull it back to

2469
01:07:47,001 --> 01:07:47,834
steroids in it.

2470
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,440
Doctor ever talked to red bed?

2471
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:53,610
Did you lose your room?

2472
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,700
None of us know anything about it.

2473
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:02,930
So pull pulls Clint out
and make it a deck back.

2474
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,200
Runs into the break room to get high,

2475
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:06,950
high.

2476
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:08,580
The other real box of paper towels,

2477
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:10,260
Doctor Read Ben,

2478
01:08:10,261 --> 01:08:11,820
we need surgery.

2479
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:13,710
I'm not feeling that good.

2480
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,090
Can you guys take care of it?

2481
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:20,210
I was listening to you and bird the
other day and you guys are talking about

2482
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:24,530
carving out the taint strip
to make a tea to make a hole.

2483
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,720
And it's like the taint strip is like,

2484
01:08:26,721 --> 01:08:27,980
you don't know what's under there.

2485
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:29,870
It's like I can basement

2486
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:32,743
cause that you guys,

2487
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:33,651
I don't remember.

2488
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:35,150
That was,

2489
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:35,780
yeah,

2490
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:36,613
it was right.

2491
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:37,700
Yeah.

2492
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,550
That's what happens when you get
three hour podcast five days a week.

2493
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:40,821
Yeah,

2494
01:08:40,821 --> 01:08:41,654
we get a lot.

2495
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,860
The log gets lost.

2496
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:48,020
There's this club called
Middlesex by a [inaudible] is the,

2497
01:08:48,021 --> 01:08:49,130
the author's last name.

2498
01:08:49,131 --> 01:08:51,110
It's probably the best
novel I've ever read.

2499
01:08:51,111 --> 01:08:54,170
And it's about a three
generations of hermaphrodites.

2500
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:57,470
And in the book it's caused by incest,

2501
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,600
a brother and a sister
having a child together,

2502
01:08:59,601 --> 01:09:02,600
which I don't know if that's true in
real life or it was just in the book.

2503
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:04,700
Oh Wow.

2504
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:05,653
I hope not.

2505
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:11,090
I'm looking at a female to male
transgenders and one of them,

2506
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:13,910
a guy was in the middle and he,

2507
01:09:13,911 --> 01:09:14,210
uh,

2508
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:15,043
got pregnant.

2509
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:19,790
He's got a baby.

2510
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,070
You mean it was,

2511
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:26,330
he's a female to male transsexual
decided to get pregnant.

2512
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:27,321
Oh yeah,

2513
01:09:27,321 --> 01:09:27,511
yeah,

2514
01:09:27,511 --> 01:09:27,800
yeah.

2515
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:28,601
I heard about that.

2516
01:09:28,601 --> 01:09:29,630
He's looks like a man.

2517
01:09:29,631 --> 01:09:30,464
He has a beard.

2518
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:30,860
Right.

2519
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:35,510
Built like a man decides
to get pregnant and um,

2520
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:37,830
he's fucking pregnant,

2521
01:09:37,831 --> 01:09:38,280
right?

2522
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:38,760
Yeah.

2523
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,061
Yeah.

2524
01:09:39,061 --> 01:09:39,894
I remember this.

2525
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:41,520
And he had two kids.

2526
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,060
I Dunno.

2527
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:46,770
He's legally married to a woman
who underwent a hysterectomy.

2528
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:52,940
He suspended his testosterone treatments
for several months prior to conceiving

2529
01:09:53,281 --> 01:09:55,560
with an anonymous sample
from a sperm bank.

2530
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:57,360
He's doing July.

2531
01:09:57,390 --> 01:09:58,230
Wow.

2532
01:09:59,260 --> 01:09:59,590
Crazy.

2533
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:01,440
Is that the most had a hysterectomy.

2534
01:10:01,441 --> 01:10:05,160
So he being the man decided to
carry the baby and they have a,

2535
01:10:05,161 --> 01:10:05,641
a sort of,

2536
01:10:05,641 --> 01:10:05,820
uh,

2537
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:06,653
both,

2538
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,291
you know,

2539
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:07,691
they have a,

2540
01:10:07,691 --> 01:10:09,570
a male female relationship.

2541
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:10,463
Yeah.

2542
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:11,323
It crazy.

2543
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,221
And they will,

2544
01:10:12,221 --> 01:10:15,790
in the summer they'll give birth to
the most teas child in the Midwest.

2545
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:17,741
Yeah.

2546
01:10:17,741 --> 01:10:19,000
Wonder where this is going down.

2547
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,100
I think it's in the Midwest.

2548
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,910
Is it really getting a second
Wisconsin or some fucking Oh,

2549
01:10:24,911 --> 01:10:25,650
Oregon.

2550
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:26,080
Oregon.

2551
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:26,320
Yeah.

2552
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,420
Oh Wow.

2553
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:29,520
Okay.

2554
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:29,880
Would you,

2555
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:30,570
what would you do?

2556
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:31,403
You're born,

2557
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:32,940
you're born a,

2558
01:10:32,941 --> 01:10:33,774
uh,

2559
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:34,491
you know,

2560
01:10:34,491 --> 01:10:35,324
right in the middle.

2561
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:37,000
You'd go either way.

2562
01:10:37,001 --> 01:10:37,930
Which way do you go?

2563
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:38,943
Oh,

2564
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:41,100
you gotta be a musician or something.

2565
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:42,510
Just take advantage of it.

2566
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:43,290
Just keep it,

2567
01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:43,920
keep it belts.

2568
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:44,220
David.

2569
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:46,080
Both date a musician.

2570
01:10:46,081 --> 01:10:48,540
Just go fucking full on nutty.

2571
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:49,470
Yeah.

2572
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:51,390
Just be completely out there

2573
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:52,460
at the end.

2574
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:53,150
Encore.

2575
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:53,983
You come out,

2576
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,630
drop your pants and blow people's minds.

2577
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:58,640
Then when they would be that freaked out,

2578
01:10:58,641 --> 01:10:59,690
they'd just be grossed out.

2579
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:03,270
Remember that movie junior with Arnold
Schwarzenegger where he got pregnant?

2580
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,433
Oh yeah,

2581
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:05,933
that's right.

2582
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:07,940
It doesn't move as worsening.

2583
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:08,611
You got pregnant.

2584
01:11:08,611 --> 01:11:10,890
That was the dumbest fucking idea ever.

2585
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:11,311
Man.

2586
01:11:11,311 --> 01:11:13,020
He's done some dumb movies.

2587
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,353
Yeah.

2588
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:15,730
Twins,

2589
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:17,670
kindergarten,

2590
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:18,360
you cop,

2591
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,540
brilliant movies.

2592
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:23,430
The guy became the God damn governor now.

2593
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,120
Pretty fucking amazing.

2594
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:29,470
I don't think too many people have
accomplished in one lifetime what he's

2595
01:11:29,471 --> 01:11:30,304
accomplished,

2596
01:11:30,730 --> 01:11:34,000
but I think that governor stuff was
a just a fucking giant waste of time.

2597
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:34,540
Yeah.

2598
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,160
Obviously it wasn't good at it either.

2599
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:39,040
Now it's the ultimate popularity,

2600
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:39,820
you know,

2601
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:42,340
guys like him with like insatiable egos,

2602
01:11:42,341 --> 01:11:43,840
they want to be the best.

2603
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:47,860
And then once you've done
the weightlifting and the
movie star politics is the

2604
01:11:47,861 --> 01:11:49,030
next level of,

2605
01:11:49,031 --> 01:11:52,240
it's all about me and I bet you they
probably do believe they're going to be

2606
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:53,074
able to fix it.

2607
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:53,770
Yeah.

2608
01:11:53,770 --> 01:11:54,890
Till they get in there and I go,

2609
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,410
oh fuck right.

2610
01:11:56,890 --> 01:11:57,940
This is a mess.

2611
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,680
Except I think in modern politics,

2612
01:11:59,681 --> 01:12:02,620
the best politicians are the
ones that believe they can cause.

2613
01:12:02,621 --> 01:12:04,600
The truth is it's not
your policies anyway.

2614
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:06,310
You're not coming in and
rolling up your sleeves.

2615
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:10,840
You're just speaking on behalf of the
group of people that hopefully have some

2616
01:12:10,841 --> 01:12:11,500
power.

2617
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:11,711
You know,

2618
01:12:11,711 --> 01:12:12,550
you're a cheerleader.

2619
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:13,150
Yup.

2620
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:14,380
You look at a guy like Reagan.

2621
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:16,330
Reagan didn't think of any of that shit.

2622
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:21,100
He just came in and he was an amazing
speaker and he embodied this like Western

2623
01:12:21,101 --> 01:12:23,290
male thing that people got behind

2624
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:27,860
Mr Gorbachev tear down that wall.

2625
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:31,320
They became Katharine Hepburn.

2626
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,120
You know what a silly old man.

2627
01:12:33,170 --> 01:12:33,990
Yeah,

2628
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:34,651
his girl,

2629
01:12:34,651 --> 01:12:36,180
a Margaret Thatcher just thought

2630
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:37,060
I re,

2631
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:38,140
I remember the,

2632
01:12:38,290 --> 01:12:40,840
with great clarity when,

2633
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:41,320
uh,

2634
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:45,490
all the Iran Contra Shit was going down
when he was testifying that he didn't

2635
01:12:45,491 --> 01:12:46,324
remember,

2636
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:47,463
like that was his

2637
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:49,080
560 times.

2638
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,420
His defense was that number,

2639
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:51,553
remember?

2640
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:52,370
Wow.

2641
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:53,660
That was amazing times,

2642
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:54,260
man.

2643
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:55,970
Cause that was the first time ever.

2644
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:56,960
And when I was young,

2645
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:57,980
obviously at the time,

2646
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:01,700
but it was the first time in my life
that I realized that the government was

2647
01:13:01,701 --> 01:13:02,534
full of shit.

2648
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:03,291
I didn't,

2649
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:04,820
I never figured it out before that.

2650
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,850
I never even had a suspicion
that was our water.

2651
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:08,953
Yeah.

2652
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,230
I remember watching
Ollie North on TV and uh,

2653
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,880
they were talking about selling drugs.

2654
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:18,530
They're talking about selling drugs in
the contras and funding the contras and

2655
01:13:18,531 --> 01:13:18,671
the,

2656
01:13:18,671 --> 01:13:19,760
and the Sandinistas,

2657
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:20,520
the,

2658
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,500
the war against them.

2659
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,191
And,

2660
01:13:22,191 --> 01:13:23,024
uh,

2661
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,080
watching it going.

2662
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,550
It was what happened.

2663
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:31,090
Like someone was involved in selling
drugs so that they could get money to buy

2664
01:13:31,101 --> 01:13:32,600
guns for people in another country.

2665
01:13:32,601 --> 01:13:32,740
Right.

2666
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:33,820
For an illegal war.

2667
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:34,441
Yeah.

2668
01:13:34,441 --> 01:13:34,991
And I was like,

2669
01:13:34,991 --> 01:13:35,770
what?

2670
01:13:35,770 --> 01:13:39,460
What are you even beyond what
you could write into a script?

2671
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:41,320
And then they shred it all the documents.

2672
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,970
And we knew they shredded the
documents and they weren't sent to,

2673
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:46,271
well,

2674
01:13:46,271 --> 01:13:47,710
Ollie north actually did some time.

2675
01:13:47,711 --> 01:13:48,544
Right.

2676
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:50,580
I think he did six months or something.

2677
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:51,623
That's fine.

2678
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:53,130
Um,

2679
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:54,780
I remember I had Ollie North for president

2680
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:55,340
two shirt,

2681
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:57,170
or maybe he got sentenced and then he got

2682
01:13:58,700 --> 01:13:59,533
acquitted.

2683
01:13:59,550 --> 01:13:59,851
Yeah.

2684
01:13:59,851 --> 01:14:03,000
Maybe it was one of those president
things were they pardoned his ass.

2685
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:04,060
Yeah.

2686
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:05,110
Pardon my ass.

2687
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:05,950
Yeah.

2688
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:06,371
He,

2689
01:14:06,371 --> 01:14:07,000
uh,

2690
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:07,540
I mean,

2691
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:07,781
look,

2692
01:14:07,781 --> 01:14:09,070
they all did that.

2693
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:12,040
They all did whatever the
fucking government wanted them to

2694
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:12,820
do.

2695
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:15,460
And once they established the CIA,

2696
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:16,601
I mean,

2697
01:14:16,601 --> 01:14:20,650
that was one of the reasons why they
probably killed Kennedy Johnson.

2698
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:21,430
He wanted it.

2699
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:23,650
He wanted to get the
fucking CIA out of there.

2700
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:27,220
He did not like the fact that it's
from world war two on the CIA.

2701
01:14:27,221 --> 01:14:29,590
It'd become like a
whole shadow government,

2702
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:31,540
the government behind the government.

2703
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:31,891
It was like,

2704
01:14:31,891 --> 01:14:32,830
what the fuck is this?

2705
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,700
What's all this shit?

2706
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:35,140
Did you read the um,

2707
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:35,770
uh,

2708
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:37,930
legend of shadows?

2709
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:38,270
No.

2710
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:39,103
Uh,

2711
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:39,670
uh,

2712
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:40,690
legacy of ashes?

2713
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:41,261
No.

2714
01:14:41,261 --> 01:14:41,740
What does that,

2715
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:43,660
the history of the CIA told by a guy,

2716
01:14:43,661 --> 01:14:45,310
he wrote it for 10 fucking years.

2717
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:48,160
I think it won the
Pulitzer Prize and it's a,

2718
01:14:48,161 --> 01:14:49,480
it's about this guy who,

2719
01:14:49,481 --> 01:14:50,830
I can't remember who the writer was,

2720
01:14:50,831 --> 01:14:51,790
but he,

2721
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:56,820
this shit was factual and it's about
every debacle that the CIA has been

2722
01:14:57,851 --> 01:14:58,451
involved in,

2723
01:14:58,451 --> 01:14:59,470
in the history of time.

2724
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:01,240
Everything we've gone into,

2725
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:06,390
we were late getting information to the
fucking Chinese and the Russians are 150

2726
01:15:06,641 --> 01:15:10,360
years ahead of us in espionage
and intelligence gathering.

2727
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:11,600
And every time we went,

2728
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,140
whether it was the Philippines or I ran,

2729
01:15:14,141 --> 01:15:17,800
it was always like a dollar a day,

2730
01:15:17,801 --> 01:15:18,011
late,

2731
01:15:18,011 --> 01:15:18,910
dollar short and,

2732
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,500
and fucking things up.

2733
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:21,221
And,

2734
01:15:21,221 --> 01:15:21,890
uh,

2735
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:22,190
and,

2736
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:23,200
and really it was like a,

2737
01:15:23,201 --> 01:15:25,990
now you've got the CIA
where it's no longer,

2738
01:15:25,991 --> 01:15:29,980
it was set up after World War II as a,

2739
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:33,700
as an agency to collect information
after the Second World War.

2740
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,670
And now it's a branch of the military.

2741
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:39,580
They are the ones controlling
the drone strikes.

2742
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,290
They're the ones that are sending,

2743
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:41,621
you know,

2744
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:43,030
when we killed Obama,

2745
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:43,991
the pope,

2746
01:15:43,991 --> 01:15:44,291
I did,

2747
01:15:44,291 --> 01:15:45,124
I just say Obama

2748
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,340
killed bin Laden.

2749
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:50,530
That was the CIA.

2750
01:15:50,531 --> 01:15:51,490
We basically,

2751
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:51,761
we,

2752
01:15:51,761 --> 01:15:52,510
we just,

2753
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:56,020
we can just turn any CIA operative into,

2754
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:56,740
um,

2755
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:59,410
I think they turn them into navy seals,

2756
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:01,090
like with the magic wand.

2757
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:04,630
And then they're allowed
to just go in and uh,

2758
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:10,270
and kill these drones are
ordered by the CIA with no trial,

2759
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:12,130
no transparency.

2760
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:13,840
They can just do it.

2761
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:14,721
Well,

2762
01:16:14,721 --> 01:16:16,220
you know about that American,

2763
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:18,410
that was a recruiter for al Qaeda.

2764
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:21,080
He spoke Arabic and he was a,

2765
01:16:21,081 --> 01:16:21,861
an American.

2766
01:16:21,861 --> 01:16:23,870
And because he was a
recruiter for al Qaeda,

2767
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:26,740
they targeted him with a
drone strike and they got him,

2768
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:27,350
they,

2769
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:29,780
they essentially murdered
an American with no trial.

2770
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:30,710
First Time in history.

2771
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:31,130
Yeah.

2772
01:16:31,130 --> 01:16:32,990
That's dark shit.

2773
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:34,820
And the fact that we're like,

2774
01:16:34,821 --> 01:16:35,690
well hey,

2775
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:36,261
you know,

2776
01:16:36,261 --> 01:16:39,440
and he's sucking not doing
good things over there.

2777
01:16:40,010 --> 01:16:42,410
Shouldn't been over
there working with them.

2778
01:16:42,411 --> 01:16:43,230
Al-Qaida

2779
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:44,790
and every morning they have a,

2780
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:46,290
they have a strike meeting that,

2781
01:16:46,291 --> 01:16:46,510
oh,

2782
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:49,170
that Obama is at where they pick,

2783
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:49,441
they,

2784
01:16:49,441 --> 01:16:50,101
it's like a kill.

2785
01:16:50,101 --> 01:16:50,251
They,

2786
01:16:50,251 --> 01:16:53,640
I think they call it a kill list and they
pick the people that they want to hit

2787
01:16:53,641 --> 01:16:54,474
with drone strikes.

2788
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:55,920
None of these people,

2789
01:16:56,130 --> 01:17:00,480
none of it is reviewed cause it's all
CIA and they just decide and then they go

2790
01:17:00,481 --> 01:17:03,300
kill him without even being on the ground.

2791
01:17:03,301 --> 01:17:04,770
Just all through a fucking,

2792
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:05,940
uh,

2793
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:09,150
playstation three app over an
Arizona in a bunker somewhere.

2794
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:10,880
Yeah.

2795
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:15,880
And the success ratio of enemy
combatants and targets to actual innocent

2796
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:17,900
civilians.

2797
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:18,800
It's through the charts.

2798
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:18,981
Oh,

2799
01:17:18,981 --> 01:17:19,610
is that right?

2800
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:20,061
Oh yeah.

2801
01:17:20,061 --> 01:17:20,894
You mean in a good way?

2802
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:21,171
No,

2803
01:17:21,171 --> 01:17:22,004
the wrong way.

2804
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:23,000
The wrong way.

2805
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,590
It's kills much more civilians.

2806
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:26,660
Have you never seen these statistics?

2807
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:27,773
It's terrifying.

2808
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:28,903
It's terrifying.

2809
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:34,090
The drone strikes civilian deaths
and innocent desks versus targets.

2810
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:38,280
It's some insane way now they
hit a wedding the way it's just,

2811
01:17:38,290 --> 01:17:39,123
it's way off.

2812
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,353
A lot of children,

2813
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:41,330
a lot of children have died.

2814
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:43,370
And it's not that,

2815
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:44,480
it's not that accurate.

2816
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:45,230
It's not that,

2817
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:48,080
I mean there's a lot of people
there then high volume areas,

2818
01:17:48,081 --> 01:17:48,870
they're there,

2819
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:50,570
they're shooting at people.

2820
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:53,170
Well cause al Qaeda hides
in cities on purpose.

2821
01:17:53,171 --> 01:17:53,920
Yeah.

2822
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:58,920
And also it's like you think about how
my whole thing ever since nine 11 is

2823
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:01,480
capture the guys that did it,

2824
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:04,600
but also protect who we are in the world,

2825
01:18:04,601 --> 01:18:06,820
how the world views us as a nation.

2826
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:07,901
You know,

2827
01:18:07,901 --> 01:18:12,901
try to control the hatred towards us by
the way we behave like stay part of the

2828
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:14,050
Geneva Convention.

2829
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:16,990
Don't fucking torture
people secretly with that.

2830
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,010
You know?

2831
01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:18,311
And,

2832
01:18:18,311 --> 01:18:21,850
and so part of that is like if you're
in a country and a drone comes in that

2833
01:18:21,851 --> 01:18:24,610
doesn't even have an actual soldier
from that other country in it,

2834
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:27,850
and it kills innocent people.

2835
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,290
Think about if that
happened in this country,

2836
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:32,980
another country sent a drone
and killed an innocent American,

2837
01:18:32,981 --> 01:18:33,641
it would be over.

2838
01:18:33,641 --> 01:18:35,590
We would be over there
in fucking eight seconds.

2839
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:37,530
Let's look at what happened in Boston.

2840
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:38,090
Right?

2841
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:40,080
So imagine that was a drone from China,

2842
01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:40,820
right?

2843
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:43,680
To kill some enemy combatant
that the Chinese don't like.

2844
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:44,940
I mean,

2845
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:45,391
that's a,

2846
01:18:45,391 --> 01:18:47,730
that's a fairly accurate assessment,

2847
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:48,060
right?

2848
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:48,450
I mean,

2849
01:18:48,450 --> 01:18:49,710
the numbers of people,

2850
01:18:49,711 --> 01:18:52,590
the innocent deaths from drone
strikes are in the thousands.

2851
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:52,961
Yeah,

2852
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:53,471
we had three,

2853
01:18:53,471 --> 01:18:53,741
I mean,

2854
01:18:53,741 --> 01:18:54,551
not to minimize it,

2855
01:18:54,551 --> 01:18:56,530
but it was three people
in Boston and yeah,

2856
01:18:56,590 --> 01:18:57,550
you're talking about,

2857
01:18:57,551 --> 01:18:58,384
you know,

2858
01:18:58,990 --> 01:19:02,380
thousands and thousands of people that uh,

2859
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:03,730
had no trial,

2860
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,020
had no recourse.

2861
01:19:05,021 --> 01:19:05,560
There was no,

2862
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,590
no press coverage of [inaudible].

2863
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:08,201
Yeah.

2864
01:19:08,201 --> 01:19:10,420
And it's happening all the time.

2865
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,700
And apparently the only
thing that slowed us down,

2866
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:15,850
slowed it down was Patraeus
when portray his cup us.

2867
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:17,020
So they took a couple of weeks off,

2868
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:18,033
right?

2869
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:19,230
Yeah.

2870
01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:21,580
Usually had to go through
meetings and see who gets to,

2871
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,950
who gets to pull the trigger
on these fucking things.

2872
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:25,021
Now.

2873
01:19:25,021 --> 01:19:26,190
Now they just take turns.

2874
01:19:26,191 --> 01:19:30,750
Apparently the Pentagon does some drone
strikes and then the CIA does some drone

2875
01:19:30,751 --> 01:19:31,584
strikes as well.

2876
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,670
This is strikes under
the Bush administration.

2877
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:36,650
How many of you think drone strikes?

2878
01:19:36,651 --> 01:19:36,910
Yeah,

2879
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:37,743
you guys

2880
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:43,220
252 the strikes under
the Obama administration.

2881
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,193
Oh,

2882
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:46,460
the 500 310

2883
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:50,780
change baby.

2884
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:53,300
Well that's cause it's
way more of them now.

2885
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:54,020
I know.

2886
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:56,990
But everyone to drones back then,

2887
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,000
liberals are so woefully inconsistent
on how they criticized Republican

2888
01:20:02,271 --> 01:20:02,781
presidents,

2889
01:20:02,781 --> 01:20:05,300
especially a black one
for being a warmonger.

2890
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:06,560
Right.

2891
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:11,190
There's so hopelessly inconsistent because
if that was Bush in office and he was

2892
01:20:11,191 --> 01:20:11,940
doing this,

2893
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:15,120
there would be democrats that
would be picketing and you know,

2894
01:20:15,121 --> 01:20:16,590
we have to stop these drones.

2895
01:20:16,591 --> 01:20:18,120
Tracks is horrible drone strikes,

2896
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:18,900
but it's,

2897
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:22,230
it seems like it's more Republicans
that are picketing against,

2898
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:23,940
against Obama.

2899
01:20:23,941 --> 01:20:26,270
It doesn't seem like he's
taken a lot of flack from,

2900
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:29,940
from liberals for murdering
innocent civilians with drones.

2901
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:31,251
Now we'll see.

2902
01:20:31,251 --> 01:20:34,040
I mean he's got some tests ahead of him
as far as how tough he is on foreign

2903
01:20:34,041 --> 01:20:34,701
policy.

2904
01:20:34,701 --> 01:20:34,971
You know,

2905
01:20:34,971 --> 01:20:36,620
what happens with North Korea,

2906
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:37,580
what happens with,

2907
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:38,211
you know,

2908
01:20:38,211 --> 01:20:38,580
if,

2909
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:39,413
um,

2910
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:40,431
if,

2911
01:20:40,431 --> 01:20:40,701
uh,

2912
01:20:40,701 --> 01:20:41,001
you know,

2913
01:20:41,001 --> 01:20:42,770
it's real decides to attack Iran,

2914
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:43,341
you know,

2915
01:20:43,341 --> 01:20:46,670
those things are going to happen
in the next six months to a year.

2916
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:47,593
Do you think so?

2917
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:49,400
It seems to me like it's overdue.

2918
01:20:49,401 --> 01:20:50,260
What's going on with,

2919
01:20:50,261 --> 01:20:51,890
with Israel is like,

2920
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,800
it seems like it's been
eminent for a long time.

2921
01:20:54,970 --> 01:20:55,661
Why do you say that?

2922
01:20:55,661 --> 01:20:56,890
Why did you say they can't work it out?

2923
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:02,040
Because the Iranians are not showing
any transparency and they're building

2924
01:21:02,041 --> 01:21:05,880
bunkers deeper and deeper into the
ground where you can't detect nuclear,

2925
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:06,540
uh,

2926
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:07,110
um,

2927
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:07,430
the,

2928
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:10,030
the building of nuclear
weapons any longer because it,

2929
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:13,200
they do it all from
fucking satellite sensors.

2930
01:21:13,390 --> 01:21:13,601
Yeah.

2931
01:21:13,601 --> 01:21:18,601
It's so funny how like
everybody is worried about
new people developing nuclear

2932
01:21:18,761 --> 01:21:19,390
power,

2933
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:20,950
but the people that have nuclear power,

2934
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:21,971
you just got to look at them.

2935
01:21:21,971 --> 01:21:22,540
We were like,

2936
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:22,931
fuck,

2937
01:21:22,931 --> 01:21:23,890
they already got it right.

2938
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:24,461
You know,

2939
01:21:24,461 --> 01:21:25,390
like North Korea,

2940
01:21:25,450 --> 01:21:26,530
Pakistan,

2941
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:26,820
you know,

2942
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:28,570
you look at India,

2943
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:28,901
any,

2944
01:21:28,901 --> 01:21:30,220
any country that has it already,

2945
01:21:30,221 --> 01:21:31,054
like,

2946
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:31,780
all right,

2947
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:32,530
they already have it.

2948
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:33,311
You can't say,

2949
01:21:33,311 --> 01:21:33,820
listen,

2950
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:34,870
you got to give it back.

2951
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:35,801
You can't have it.

2952
01:21:35,801 --> 01:21:36,670
You guys are idiots.

2953
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:37,533
Can we hit?

2954
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:38,110
Yeah,

2955
01:21:38,110 --> 01:21:38,521
do it.

2956
01:21:38,521 --> 01:21:38,780
Yeah.

2957
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:40,600
Soon it will be like a in America,

2958
01:21:40,601 --> 01:21:42,550
like everybody has to carry a gun.

2959
01:21:42,551 --> 01:21:43,720
That's the only way to make it safe.

2960
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:45,760
We'll go back to this
cold war thing of like,

2961
01:21:45,761 --> 01:21:48,880
well then every country should have
one cause then nobody will ever do it.

2962
01:21:49,190 --> 01:21:51,650
But like if Japan tried
to develop a nuclear bomb,

2963
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:52,700
we still wouldn't let them,

2964
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:56,720
even though it was like 60 plus
years ago that we dropped on them,

2965
01:21:56,721 --> 01:21:57,860
we've done then then,

2966
01:21:57,861 --> 01:21:58,041
then,

2967
01:21:58,041 --> 01:21:58,221
then,

2968
01:21:58,221 --> 01:21:58,401
then,

2969
01:21:58,401 --> 01:22:00,200
then you guys can have that like,

2970
01:22:00,201 --> 01:22:00,411
look,

2971
01:22:00,411 --> 01:22:00,591
we're,

2972
01:22:00,591 --> 01:22:00,791
we're,

2973
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:02,120
we're not even upset about that.

2974
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:03,730
We're not even going to retaliate.

2975
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:03,951
Look,

2976
01:22:03,951 --> 01:22:05,300
that was 60 years ago.

2977
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:07,610
It was my father's father
was involved in that.

2978
01:22:07,611 --> 01:22:08,810
I have no dog in this.

2979
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:10,520
We were kind of being assholes.

2980
01:22:11,150 --> 01:22:11,541
We look,

2981
01:22:11,541 --> 01:22:12,200
we deserve,

2982
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,190
we deserve to beating.

2983
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:13,791
But,

2984
01:22:13,791 --> 01:22:14,480
uh,

2985
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:14,870
um,

2986
01:22:14,870 --> 01:22:16,280
I would like to have nuclear power.

2987
01:22:16,281 --> 01:22:16,760
Please.

2988
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:17,930
I would like to have nuclear weapons.

2989
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:19,490
Come on please.

2990
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:21,560
We won't do anything.

2991
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:22,310
No,

2992
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:23,960
we don't let anybody get them.

2993
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,220
That doesn't already have them.

2994
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:26,001
If you already have,

2995
01:22:26,001 --> 01:22:27,050
we just go shit.

2996
01:22:27,170 --> 01:22:27,860
Right.

2997
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:28,693
That's it.

2998
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:29,420
But I ran.

2999
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:30,570
We don't trust you but you,

3000
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:31,401
you don't trust us,

3001
01:22:31,401 --> 01:22:32,420
but you trust North Korea.

3002
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:33,373
That's not what I said.

3003
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:35,121
North Korea.

3004
01:22:35,121 --> 01:22:35,690
He has them,

3005
01:22:35,690 --> 01:22:36,523
but you can't have them.

3006
01:22:36,850 --> 01:22:37,430
Right.

3007
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:38,180
Cause if you,

3008
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:39,050
if you had to choose a student,

3009
01:22:39,051 --> 01:22:40,640
what's the more rational government?

3010
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:44,930
You look at Iranians and you look in North
Koreans as much as we want to look at

3011
01:22:44,931 --> 01:22:45,764
Iran,

3012
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:48,340
Iran as a being a,

3013
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:49,370
a backwards country.

3014
01:22:49,371 --> 01:22:51,570
There's a lot of young people there
that are hip to what the fuck is,

3015
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:52,530
sorry.

3016
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:53,640
It's a very well educated

3017
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:54,151
Friday.

3018
01:22:54,151 --> 01:22:54,871
Progressive.

3019
01:22:54,871 --> 01:22:55,411
Very,

3020
01:22:55,411 --> 01:22:56,244
uh,

3021
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:56,580
it's,

3022
01:22:56,580 --> 01:23:00,180
it's not what people like think of
when people think of the Middle East,

3023
01:23:00,181 --> 01:23:04,140
especially people that don't have a good
knowledge of what it really looks like

3024
01:23:04,150 --> 01:23:06,250
in certain parts of everything's the same.

3025
01:23:06,251 --> 01:23:07,480
Everything's a fucking desert.

3026
01:23:07,481 --> 01:23:09,940
Camels and shit all fucked.

3027
01:23:10,190 --> 01:23:10,600
Right.

3028
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:11,750
But I ran isn't,

3029
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:12,520
is not,

3030
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,820
I mean there's a lot of
young educated people there.

3031
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:15,370
Yeah.

3032
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:20,290
So like for them to not have
nuclear weapons and see North Korea,

3033
01:23:20,530 --> 01:23:22,000
that's especially under,

3034
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:24,100
that's like some old school,

3035
01:23:24,101 --> 01:23:27,700
1920s dictatorship going on there.

3036
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:32,650
I mean that guy is still rocking it the
way people rocked it in the Middle Ages.

3037
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:35,590
He's a real dictator in a digital age.

3038
01:23:35,591 --> 01:23:36,040
It is

3039
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:41,040
beyond the fact that he's been
able to control that country with,

3040
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:44,830
I mean once in a while somebody escapes
and it's rare and then they tell you

3041
01:23:44,831 --> 01:23:45,040
about,

3042
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:45,550
they're like,

3043
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:45,721
no,

3044
01:23:45,721 --> 01:23:46,540
you don't understand.

3045
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:51,340
We all live in little fucking hovels
and were treated like slaves and your

3046
01:23:51,341 --> 01:23:53,230
friends tell on you and they're rewarded.

3047
01:23:53,231 --> 01:23:54,064
Your coworkers,

3048
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:55,090
your fucking students.

3049
01:23:55,091 --> 01:23:59,830
You're in third grade and there's thought
crime where a kid will turn you in and

3050
01:23:59,831 --> 01:24:02,410
that's how you grow up
and you and you love.

3051
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:05,890
They say that they're taught in
school like a math problem would be.

3052
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:06,940
Okay,

3053
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:09,730
five American soldiers are on a field.

3054
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,140
You killed two of them.

3055
01:24:11,290 --> 01:24:14,700
How many left do you have to kill it?

3056
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:17,230
Everything is kill American soldiers.

3057
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:18,693
Yeah.

3058
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:20,183
Wow,

3059
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:22,623
dear leader

3060
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:24,210
and end to fit.

3061
01:24:24,211 --> 01:24:25,290
Luckily they don't have that.

3062
01:24:25,291 --> 01:24:29,220
They don't have the the rockets to
send that shit anywhere besides stuff.

3063
01:24:29,221 --> 01:24:29,580
Yeah,

3064
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:30,410
that's the problem.

3065
01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:30,680
Those,

3066
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:34,200
they could send it in to South Korea
and that would just set it off.

3067
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:37,260
Apparently they have just
an insane amount of weapons.

3068
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:39,860
Rockets and Shit just
pointed in that direction.

3069
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:42,570
Just ready to light up if
we don't give them rice.

3070
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:44,423
All right.

3071
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:45,450
That's all this is.

3072
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:46,680
They just renegotiate,

3073
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:48,030
renegotiating their contract.

3074
01:24:48,031 --> 01:24:50,460
We give them these nice
fucking little little,

3075
01:24:50,461 --> 01:24:51,180
here you go,

3076
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:54,450
shut up for three years and then three
years later they say they're going to do

3077
01:24:54,451 --> 01:24:54,890
this.

3078
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:57,690
It's amazing also that with the CIA's uh,

3079
01:24:57,770 --> 01:25:00,890
ability to infiltrate
governments and manipulate them.

3080
01:25:00,891 --> 01:25:02,030
Third worlds especially,

3081
01:25:02,031 --> 01:25:02,330
you know,

3082
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:05,360
economic hitman type situations
and never been able to do anything.

3083
01:25:05,361 --> 01:25:07,610
But I'm mother fucker can't get a grip,

3084
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:08,470
can't get it.

3085
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:10,060
China is flood.

3086
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:14,300
China's floating them and
their situation is too nutty.

3087
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:15,553
It's too crazy.

3088
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:16,970
It's too far in.

3089
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:20,840
Like this guy's got a full
iron grip on his populous.

3090
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,610
I mean he really has them locked in.

3091
01:25:22,611 --> 01:25:23,690
Like you're not going to fix that.

3092
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:25,680
Can you see those troops marching?

3093
01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:27,180
They look fucking good.

3094
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:27,960
Yeah,

3095
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:28,651
they are like,

3096
01:25:28,651 --> 01:25:30,690
they got some kickass uniforms.

3097
01:25:30,691 --> 01:25:31,920
They're in lock step.

3098
01:25:32,490 --> 01:25:33,390
It's wild.

3099
01:25:33,530 --> 01:25:33,711
Yeah.

3100
01:25:33,711 --> 01:25:37,310
You better not be out of step when
you're in the North Korean army now,

3101
01:25:39,030 --> 01:25:43,160
which is so weird how some you'll look
at the whole world is like all happening

3102
01:25:43,161 --> 01:25:43,994
all at once.

3103
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:49,190
You can get like people in California
on a podcast at the same time,

3104
01:25:49,461 --> 01:25:54,461
someone in the jungle of the Amazon
trying to kill a monkey with a stick and

3105
01:25:54,891 --> 01:25:59,060
then someone in North Korea
that's a fake crying for the dead.

3106
01:25:59,061 --> 01:25:59,301
Kim,

3107
01:25:59,301 --> 01:26:00,134
Jon ill,

3108
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:00,740
you know,

3109
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:01,573
I mean,

3110
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:03,350
all of that's happening at the time,

3111
01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:04,243
right?

3112
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:07,070
A lot of parts of this world
are just fucking goofy.

3113
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:11,250
Did you see this a 60 minutes at this
thing about the lost boys and they were

3114
01:26:11,251 --> 01:26:12,620
from um,

3115
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:13,601
Kenny,

3116
01:26:13,601 --> 01:26:14,610
I think or some,

3117
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:15,473
some fucking,

3118
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:20,480
they had to escape war torn Congo years
ago and they walked like a hundred miles

3119
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:22,740
to get into um,

3120
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:23,580
uh,

3121
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:24,450
Tanzania,

3122
01:26:24,451 --> 01:26:25,620
that's where it was Tanzania.

3123
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:29,720
And then they got sponsored by a bunch
of Americans to come over because they

3124
01:26:29,730 --> 01:26:31,710
were just living in these camps
where they were starving to death.

3125
01:26:31,711 --> 01:26:35,370
And so these Christian groups brought
them over and it was tracking these 10

3126
01:26:35,371 --> 01:26:36,900
dudes who literally,

3127
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:41,580
they hadn't seen a photograph in their
lives and all the sudden they're brought

3128
01:26:41,581 --> 01:26:45,030
to the u s where they've
got a digest TV tray.

3129
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:47,910
Like they got an escalator and
they all fell down backwards.

3130
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:48,744
It was hysterical.

3131
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:49,793
They didn't,

3132
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:53,320
they just all fell over by,

3133
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,110
they didn't get that it was moving and,

3134
01:26:55,111 --> 01:26:56,010
but then they were like,

3135
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:57,690
the thing that fuck these guys up,

3136
01:26:57,691 --> 01:27:01,770
and a lot of them got into drugs and
drinking was what is reality because all

3137
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:03,210
the sudden you say to them,

3138
01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:04,163
well,

3139
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:06,930
is there really a man on the moon?

3140
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:07,890
They're like,

3141
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:08,880
oh yeah,

3142
01:27:08,881 --> 01:27:10,740
of course it's been a
man landed on the moon.

3143
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:11,460
Well,

3144
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:12,360
but is there,

3145
01:27:12,690 --> 01:27:13,523
um,

3146
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:14,670
is there a Batman?

3147
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:15,271
No,

3148
01:27:15,271 --> 01:27:16,260
there's no Batman.

3149
01:27:16,350 --> 01:27:19,080
So it's like the d trying
to distinguish when you,

3150
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:19,740
when you,

3151
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:23,070
when you haven't thought outside of your
little village that there's been a man

3152
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:23,904
on the moon,

3153
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:28,650
it fucks flux every possibility
up for anything smaller.

3154
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:29,261
Well,

3155
01:27:29,261 --> 01:27:30,610
the Batman thing,

3156
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:32,210
like they don't understand fiction.

3157
01:27:32,211 --> 01:27:32,830
Is that what it is?

3158
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:33,101
No.

3159
01:27:33,101 --> 01:27:33,311
I mean,

3160
01:27:33,311 --> 01:27:35,020
Batman's Batman is probably a bad example,

3161
01:27:35,021 --> 01:27:36,220
but like that,

3162
01:27:36,221 --> 01:27:38,320
there's no such thing as flying saucers.

3163
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:43,540
So you got to teach this person from
scratch that flying sauces are made up and

3164
01:27:43,541 --> 01:27:44,290
not real,

3165
01:27:44,290 --> 01:27:45,820
not according to your show on Scifi.

3166
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:46,600
But

3167
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,290
yeah.

3168
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:48,360
[inaudible] has no opinion.

3169
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:49,673
Got It.

3170
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:52,800
But that there are actual men
that have walked on the moon.

3171
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:54,060
How do you make that distinction

3172
01:27:54,130 --> 01:27:54,790
to somebody?

3173
01:27:54,790 --> 01:27:54,971
Well,

3174
01:27:54,971 --> 01:27:55,810
how do you make this,

3175
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:57,340
how do you explain to them air flight.

3176
01:27:57,370 --> 01:27:59,100
How do you explain to the telephones,

3177
01:27:59,101 --> 01:27:59,934
how to explain to them,

3178
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:02,950
be able to get a website
on a wireless laptop.

3179
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:03,813
What,

3180
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,451
what are you doing?

3181
01:28:04,451 --> 01:28:05,284
You're pulling,

3182
01:28:05,470 --> 01:28:06,370
what are you doing?

3183
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:08,110
Are you getting that picture Amir?

3184
01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:09,340
Yeah.

3185
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:10,150
Amir.

3186
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:10,983
Jesus Christ.

3187
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:13,180
It's like a pond but on your wall.

3188
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:15,010
But I have no fish.

3189
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:19,030
Crocodiles going to jump out of it.

3190
01:28:19,270 --> 01:28:20,530
Especially as an adult.

3191
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:21,770
I'm trying to look,

3192
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:26,980
put together this culture as an
adult that had no information before.

3193
01:28:28,150 --> 01:28:31,160
This is a lot of shit we have
to process on a regular basis,

3194
01:28:31,161 --> 01:28:31,311
right?

3195
01:28:31,311 --> 01:28:32,110
Yeah.

3196
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:34,000
More so in cities than anywhere.

3197
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:35,890
I went to New York City again last week,

3198
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:37,800
was there for the upfronts.

3199
01:28:37,830 --> 01:28:39,850
I hadn't been there in awhile and um,

3200
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:40,863
I forgot,

3201
01:28:41,290 --> 01:28:42,490
I forgot how crazy it is.

3202
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:43,990
I forgot how ridiculous it is.

3203
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,150
I forgot how long it takes
to get to the airport too.

3204
01:28:46,510 --> 01:28:50,140
It's stupid cause they have those old
roads that were invented when people were

3205
01:28:50,141 --> 01:28:50,840
on horses.

3206
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:51,140
It's,

3207
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:56,140
it's hard to believe the van Wyck is it
functioning route at this point is a me,

3208
01:28:56,691 --> 01:29:01,691
it's maybe the most traveled road in
America and it's a broken down piece of

3209
01:29:01,891 --> 01:29:02,130
shit

3210
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:05,230
with no shoulder holes to horrible

3211
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:05,911
puddles.

3212
01:29:05,911 --> 01:29:06,930
Every winter new ones,

3213
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,750
giant break like um,

3214
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:11,310
or a wheel snapping.

3215
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:11,700
Yeah.

3216
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:15,510
I broke two wheels in
one day once in New York.

3217
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:16,950
I was living in new Rochelle.

3218
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:17,611
I drove in,

3219
01:29:17,611 --> 01:29:18,331
I hit a Pothole,

3220
01:29:18,331 --> 01:29:19,860
I blew out my fucking tire,

3221
01:29:19,861 --> 01:29:20,880
cracked my wheel,

3222
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:21,901
took it off,

3223
01:29:21,901 --> 01:29:22,734
threw it out,

3224
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,030
put the spare on,

3225
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:25,020
driving home,

3226
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:26,440
blew out and otherwise,

3227
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:27,420
same thing.

3228
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:29,010
Hit these giant holes.

3229
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:30,570
You really need like a fucking,

3230
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:33,420
like a Humvee to travel
back and forth to the city.

3231
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:34,710
When you go through,

3232
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:35,461
when you take,

3233
01:29:35,461 --> 01:29:36,160
um,

3234
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:36,700
uh,

3235
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:39,330
it was it 95 when you're
going through the Bronx,

3236
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:40,570
what is that cross Bronx.

3237
01:29:40,571 --> 01:29:41,520
Is it 95?

3238
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:42,710
Yeah.

3239
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:42,960
When you're,

3240
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,660
when you're taking that
road like good luck.

3241
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:49,050
He better be ready to swerve at anytime
you you'll have a swimming pool in the

3242
01:29:49,051 --> 01:29:49,880
middle of the fucking road.

3243
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:50,301
Oh yeah.

3244
01:29:50,301 --> 01:29:54,400
And they and the lanes where like they
use bad tar so it got hot in the summer.

3245
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:57,890
Now there's groups at your
tires go into and the trucks,

3246
01:29:57,891 --> 01:29:58,401
cause it goes,

3247
01:29:58,401 --> 01:30:02,840
it's the Gw bridge is 95 and so you
come off of that and it's suspended,

3248
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:04,180
but it's like fucking,

3249
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:09,340
it's all grooved no shoulder and you've
got people merging on one side and then

3250
01:30:10,401 --> 01:30:14,480
they're trying to get off to the left
onto the Deegan within a hundred yards.

3251
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:15,700
It's,

3252
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:18,440
it's chaos and sometimes it's snowing.

3253
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:19,393
Yeah,

3254
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:20,120
right.

3255
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:24,350
Sometimes it's frozen rain and the whole
thing becomes a big ice skating rink.

3256
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:25,400
And if you're going,

3257
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:28,730
if you're going through the Bronx West
and you've got to make that left to go

3258
01:30:28,731 --> 01:30:29,600
now to dig in into the,

3259
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:31,280
her down the west side
highway into the city,

3260
01:30:31,490 --> 01:30:32,480
you missed the turn.

3261
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:32,870
Yes.

3262
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:35,510
Where you're gone fucking Jersey Pal.

3263
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:39,230
You can't turn around like
15 miles to come back.

3264
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:41,393
And it's like,

3265
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:44,290
so let's try to take you to the airport.

3266
01:30:44,291 --> 01:30:46,240
You miss the exit and you've
got to go all the way to Jersey.

3267
01:30:47,050 --> 01:30:48,860
You fucking retard.

3268
01:30:49,150 --> 01:30:53,150
You fuck a free jar and you're looking
at the traffic on the way back.

3269
01:30:54,650 --> 01:30:55,483
It's death.

3270
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:57,870
Nothing but death both ways,

3271
01:30:57,871 --> 01:30:58,704
right?

3272
01:30:59,010 --> 01:30:59,191
Yeah.

3273
01:30:59,191 --> 01:31:00,390
That's a stupid way to live,

3274
01:31:00,391 --> 01:31:00,900
man.

3275
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:02,010
It's bad ass though.

3276
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:03,570
It's taking place in the world.

3277
01:31:03,571 --> 01:31:05,070
Do you think you could
live in a Manhattan again?

3278
01:31:05,650 --> 01:31:06,483
Could you?

3279
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:07,373
Would you enjoy it?

3280
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:08,503
Very much so.

3281
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:09,930
What would you enjoy about it?

3282
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:14,310
Just the being in the center of all the
people to go to a coffee shop anytime of

3283
01:31:14,311 --> 01:31:18,930
the day and get the fucking newspaper
and just get some eggs and coffee and sit

3284
01:31:18,931 --> 01:31:21,240
there for three hours and
write and look at people,

3285
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:23,190
get on the subway and look at people.

3286
01:31:23,191 --> 01:31:23,700
I just,

3287
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:25,920
I like to be pressed
right up against people.

3288
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:26,730
Wow.

3289
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:27,563
That's interesting.

3290
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:29,190
See,

3291
01:31:29,190 --> 01:31:30,180
I'm the total opposite.

3292
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,090
I like to be on the woods,

3293
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:34,063
right?

3294
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:36,690
To sit on top of a mountain
overlooking a lake.

3295
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:37,770
Just chill.

3296
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:38,700
That's,

3297
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:39,840
that seems to be like,

3298
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:42,090
I think I get plenty out of people

3299
01:31:45,430 --> 01:31:47,140
I think is good about Manhattan though,

3300
01:31:47,141 --> 01:31:48,550
is that everyone's integrated.

3301
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:49,030
Yeah,

3302
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:51,820
it's everyone's forced
to go in the same stream.

3303
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:52,631
You know?

3304
01:31:52,631 --> 01:31:56,920
It's like the can't hop in the Range
Rover's lock the door and avoid black

3305
01:31:56,921 --> 01:31:58,030
people like you.

3306
01:31:58,031 --> 01:32:00,130
You have to be next to that loud mouth

3307
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:02,260
Puerto Rican girl on the subway
because that's how you get home,

3308
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:03,131
you know?

3309
01:32:03,131 --> 01:32:05,980
And you have to deal with all these
different people you'd have to deal with.

3310
01:32:05,981 --> 01:32:07,240
And I think that's,

3311
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:09,940
it makes it a more tolerant
place because of that.

3312
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:10,271
You know,

3313
01:32:10,271 --> 01:32:12,220
I think people in New York
have a lot of attitudes,

3314
01:32:12,221 --> 01:32:13,750
but they also have a tolerance,

3315
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:14,790
you know?

3316
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:15,511
I think so.

3317
01:32:15,511 --> 01:32:18,930
I think it's probably the most integrated
place I've ever seen and I don't,

3318
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:21,060
I never felt a lot of racism.

3319
01:32:21,061 --> 01:32:21,271
I mean,

3320
01:32:21,271 --> 01:32:24,090
I grew up in New York and I
never felt a lot of racism there.

3321
01:32:24,110 --> 01:32:26,150
Fuck a little black against white racism.

3322
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:27,420
You did?

3323
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:27,611
Yeah,

3324
01:32:27,611 --> 01:32:28,280
I experienced that.

3325
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:29,113
Yeah,

3326
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:30,133
quite a few times.

3327
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:31,883
Is that,

3328
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:33,353
I wouldn't say,

3329
01:32:33,390 --> 01:32:38,390
I would say compared to like being in
Boston and places where it's much more

3330
01:32:38,401 --> 01:32:40,020
defined like this neighborhoods black,

3331
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,011
this one's Italian,

3332
01:32:41,011 --> 01:32:42,750
this one's Irish in New York.

3333
01:32:43,110 --> 01:32:44,640
The Bronx would like that a little bit.

3334
01:32:44,641 --> 01:32:47,370
You've got pockets that
are still self contained,

3335
01:32:47,371 --> 01:32:49,590
but for the most part it's um,

3336
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:51,360
it's anybody live in anywhere.

3337
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:51,781
Yeah.

3338
01:32:51,781 --> 01:32:52,770
The Manhattan,

3339
01:32:52,771 --> 01:32:54,660
especially one of the things being is,

3340
01:32:54,661 --> 01:32:56,760
it's so damn expensive to live there.

3341
01:32:57,150 --> 01:32:57,831
You know that you're,

3342
01:32:57,831 --> 01:33:02,640
you're dealing with people that are
maybe a little bit more educated and more

3343
01:33:02,641 --> 01:33:03,474
willing,

3344
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:03,930
you know,

3345
01:33:03,930 --> 01:33:04,763
to,

3346
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:05,201
first of all,

3347
01:33:05,201 --> 01:33:06,180
if you got to pay to live,

3348
01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:06,781
you gotta be,

3349
01:33:06,781 --> 01:33:09,540
you gotta be making some good
money to live in Manhattan,

3350
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,480
to live well in Manhattan to live.

3351
01:33:12,570 --> 01:33:13,150
Yeah.

3352
01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:13,983
I mean,

3353
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:15,730
you think about it like an apartment.

3354
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:17,440
Say say you were just a couple,

3355
01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:19,030
you'd have to get a one bedroom apartment.

3356
01:33:19,031 --> 01:33:22,600
You're not going to get a one bedroom
apartment on the island of Manhattan for

3357
01:33:22,601 --> 01:33:26,410
less than probably four or $5,000 a month.

3358
01:33:26,450 --> 01:33:27,160
Okay.

3359
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:28,750
And then you got to carry your laundry.

3360
01:33:28,751 --> 01:33:29,500
You're not going to have a,

3361
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:31,540
you're not going to have a
washing machine in there.

3362
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:32,080
Yeah.

3363
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,780
You're carrying your
shit up and downstairs.

3364
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:35,230
You every time you buy groceries,

3365
01:33:35,231 --> 01:33:37,480
you're buying them piecemeal in a corner,

3366
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:40,630
in a corner store for four times
what you pay for in a grocery store.

3367
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:40,930
Yeah.

3368
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:44,620
You're taking cabs all the
time constantly and you know,

3369
01:33:44,621 --> 01:33:45,454
it's just,

3370
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:47,530
it's and the taxes.

3371
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:52,540
You get taxed federal state and then
there's a city tax for living in the city.

3372
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:54,100
Used to drive me crazy.

3373
01:33:54,101 --> 01:33:57,280
It's like all these other assholes would
come in from Long Island and New Jersey

3374
01:33:57,370 --> 01:33:58,330
work in the city,

3375
01:33:58,390 --> 01:34:00,670
use up all the utilities and you know,

3376
01:34:00,671 --> 01:34:02,740
drive on the roads and then leave.

3377
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:04,330
They didn't have to pay a city tax.

3378
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:05,611
Yeah,

3379
01:34:05,611 --> 01:34:06,480
but you want to live there.

3380
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:07,261
Do you want to live there?

3381
01:34:07,261 --> 01:34:07,900
You got to pay it.

3382
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:08,231
I know,

3383
01:34:08,231 --> 01:34:09,640
but they're using it more than I am.

3384
01:34:09,641 --> 01:34:11,620
They're fucking gobbling
it up when they come in.

3385
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:14,170
All these assholes from Jersey littering.

3386
01:34:14,230 --> 01:34:15,400
How much was the city tax?

3387
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:16,810
It was,

3388
01:34:16,810 --> 01:34:17,111
God,

3389
01:34:17,111 --> 01:34:18,070
I don't know the number.

3390
01:34:18,071 --> 01:34:18,761
Can you look that it,

3391
01:34:18,761 --> 01:34:19,594
it was a lot.

3392
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:20,613
It was like,

3393
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:22,750
I want to say 3%

3394
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:23,863
ooh.

3395
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:24,741
Of Your what?

3396
01:34:24,741 --> 01:34:25,550
Your income?

3397
01:34:25,550 --> 01:34:26,630
I believe so.

3398
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:27,860
Oh my God.

3399
01:34:27,861 --> 01:34:29,000
I could be totally wrong,

3400
01:34:29,001 --> 01:34:30,700
but that's what I remember being,

3401
01:34:31,290 --> 01:34:31,820
um,

3402
01:34:31,820 --> 01:34:32,960
that's ridiculous.

3403
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:34,490
That is,

3404
01:34:34,490 --> 01:34:36,560
what do you think about
the flat tax to us?

3405
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:37,993
Well,

3406
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:38,630
you know,

3407
01:34:38,630 --> 01:34:41,150
I think it sounds great when people who,

3408
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:42,020
you know,

3409
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:44,060
talk about it who are proponents of it,

3410
01:34:44,390 --> 01:34:46,160
but then when people would
talk about it and say like,

3411
01:34:46,161 --> 01:34:47,000
what are you going to do with that?

3412
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:49,400
With all that less income,

3413
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:50,070
you know,

3414
01:34:50,070 --> 01:34:50,960
people are going to suffer.

3415
01:34:50,961 --> 01:34:54,770
Like you're going to have to cut a lot
of programs that people count on and it

3416
01:34:54,771 --> 01:34:57,690
seems to be the wealthy are more
in favor of than poor people.

3417
01:34:57,740 --> 01:34:58,840
Oh of course.

3418
01:34:58,870 --> 01:34:59,980
Wealthy would be psyched.

3419
01:35:00,450 --> 01:35:00,640
Like,

3420
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:02,860
cause people were talking
about like a 7% flat tax.

3421
01:35:02,861 --> 01:35:06,640
I mean those was the last time it
was 14% is that what he came up with?

3422
01:35:06,641 --> 01:35:07,090
Yeah,

3423
01:35:07,090 --> 01:35:07,960
but whatever it is,

3424
01:35:07,961 --> 01:35:10,690
I mean what most people
were supposed to be paying,

3425
01:35:10,691 --> 01:35:12,490
it's like 48% Obama,

3426
01:35:12,491 --> 01:35:13,324
we paid like 18

3427
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:13,951
no,

3428
01:35:13,951 --> 01:35:14,790
but that's adjusted.

3429
01:35:15,270 --> 01:35:18,870
He gives 150 150,000 to charity.

3430
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:21,990
So if you were to tax him on the
amount before his deductions,

3431
01:35:21,991 --> 01:35:23,430
it was like 30 something percent.

3432
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:26,100
And he said while he ran,

3433
01:35:26,190 --> 01:35:28,080
I should be paying more taxes.

3434
01:35:28,290 --> 01:35:32,400
He ran on that idea that you should be
raising the tax rates for people like me.

3435
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:34,580
So obviously he's the president.

3436
01:35:34,581 --> 01:35:37,980
There's no fucking way he's cutting
corners on paying his taxes.

3437
01:35:38,370 --> 01:35:40,500
He's paying exactly what you should you,

3438
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:44,220
you can't expect him to throw
extra in at the end of that.

3439
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,630
Like here's a tip,

3440
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:46,440
US

3441
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:47,120
government,

3442
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:51,170
I believe he actually did
like cut his pay because a,

3443
01:35:51,171 --> 01:35:54,080
the in solidarity for
something else that's going on.

3444
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:54,830
Sounds familiar.

3445
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:56,390
Some other cuts that are going on.

3446
01:35:56,391 --> 01:35:56,950
Right.

3447
01:35:56,950 --> 01:35:58,330
But I don't think that you can,

3448
01:35:58,570 --> 01:36:00,220
I think if you can criticize,

3449
01:36:00,550 --> 01:36:01,383
um,

3450
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:02,350
Mitt Romney,

3451
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:07,360
it was because a lot of his money was
kept in offshore accounts and that a lot

3452
01:36:07,361 --> 01:36:09,790
of it was paid through a capital gains.

3453
01:36:09,791 --> 01:36:14,050
There was a lot of like shell games going
on in terms of how he was paid through

3454
01:36:14,051 --> 01:36:14,650
Shell.

3455
01:36:14,650 --> 01:36:15,483
Yeah.

3456
01:36:17,290 --> 01:36:18,190
Mitt Romney.

3457
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:19,233
Unbelievable.

3458
01:36:19,370 --> 01:36:19,870
He was,

3459
01:36:19,870 --> 01:36:21,310
that was so silly.

3460
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:26,290
We almost had a cult member in the White
House and people were so gung Ho for it

3461
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:27,700
just because he was white.

3462
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:30,880
I was driving to California
or to San Francisco.

3463
01:36:31,150 --> 01:36:34,120
And you know how you go through a
farm country for a lot of the way,

3464
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:36,420
you know you're going driving
through Bakersfield area.

3465
01:36:36,730 --> 01:36:39,220
Steinbeck country as I'm driving up there,

3466
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:40,113
um,

3467
01:36:40,330 --> 01:36:43,450
fucking giant Mitt Romney
signs everywhere still.

3468
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:43,931
No,

3469
01:36:43,931 --> 01:36:48,520
they were for the [inaudible] still the
queer holding out hope for a recount.

3470
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:49,671
No heat boy.

3471
01:36:49,671 --> 01:36:50,540
Did he go away?

3472
01:36:50,620 --> 01:36:51,110
Yeah,

3473
01:36:51,110 --> 01:36:52,010
I mean Sarah Palin,

3474
01:36:52,011 --> 01:36:52,671
she finished up,

3475
01:36:52,671 --> 01:36:54,170
she got a job on CNN.

3476
01:36:54,171 --> 01:36:55,040
She put out a book.

3477
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:56,570
They told Mitt Romney,

3478
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,640
they go get the fuck out.

3479
01:36:58,700 --> 01:36:59,511
Go lay low.

3480
01:36:59,511 --> 01:37:01,100
We don't want to see you.

3481
01:37:01,210 --> 01:37:03,500
Do you think you've seen him
on an interview since it's

3482
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,840
probably been humiliated and tired.

3483
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:08,060
I guess it takes a lot out of you,

3484
01:37:08,061 --> 01:37:08,420
man.

3485
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:11,360
Obama looked like the age five
years and that election he did.

3486
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:12,291
It's a,

3487
01:37:12,291 --> 01:37:12,950
it's a rough,

3488
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:15,110
it must be just the look on his face,

3489
01:37:15,111 --> 01:37:18,200
Obama's face compared to like
when he was first in the office.

3490
01:37:18,230 --> 01:37:18,411
Like,

3491
01:37:18,411 --> 01:37:19,670
he doesn't even be the same human,

3492
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:21,320
he's all gray hair,

3493
01:37:21,330 --> 01:37:22,163
you know,

3494
01:37:22,190 --> 01:37:23,330
and he just looks like a dude.

3495
01:37:23,331 --> 01:37:25,070
He's just got the weight of
the world on his shoulders.

3496
01:37:25,071 --> 01:37:26,270
So wife's still looks good.

3497
01:37:26,330 --> 01:37:27,110
So there's good.

3498
01:37:27,110 --> 01:37:27,540
Yeah.

3499
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:30,890
Keeps it from the truth is that what
he's doing gives us some good Dick and

3500
01:37:30,891 --> 01:37:31,730
keeps her from the truth.

3501
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:33,470
It's not a model for marriage.

3502
01:37:33,471 --> 01:37:34,610
That's all we need to do.

3503
01:37:37,190 --> 01:37:38,420
Sex with the wife yesterday,

3504
01:37:39,380 --> 01:37:40,010
Greg for it.

3505
01:37:40,010 --> 01:37:40,870
So that's good.

3506
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:41,740
Do,

3507
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:42,573
do,

3508
01:37:43,310 --> 01:37:44,143
do,

3509
01:37:44,990 --> 01:37:46,880
do you imagine,

3510
01:37:46,910 --> 01:37:49,820
I'm asking your wife to do
something as crazy as it be.

3511
01:37:49,821 --> 01:37:51,500
The first lady like,

3512
01:37:51,501 --> 01:37:51,771
you know,

3513
01:37:51,771 --> 01:37:52,940
just like we're all in,

3514
01:37:52,990 --> 01:37:53,300
you know,

3515
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:55,010
it's not just me being the president.

3516
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:56,190
Like you have to be the first lady.

3517
01:37:56,410 --> 01:37:57,780
You can't keep your regular job.

3518
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:02,190
You can't just keep working for xerox
and be the first lady that you gotta be

3519
01:38:02,191 --> 01:38:02,950
the first lady.

3520
01:38:02,950 --> 01:38:06,040
You're going to have to control every
word you say for the next four year and

3521
01:38:06,041 --> 01:38:06,521
the kids,

3522
01:38:06,521 --> 01:38:08,080
how do you put your
kids in that situation?

3523
01:38:08,081 --> 01:38:08,351
Yeah.

3524
01:38:08,351 --> 01:38:10,990
The kids for the rest of the lives
are going to be under secret service

3525
01:38:10,991 --> 01:38:11,441
protection.

3526
01:38:11,441 --> 01:38:11,591
Right?

3527
01:38:11,591 --> 01:38:11,790
Yeah.

3528
01:38:11,790 --> 01:38:12,700
Cause then that work that way.

3529
01:38:12,810 --> 01:38:13,360
I,

3530
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:15,100
I think they have the option to,

3531
01:38:15,101 --> 01:38:16,900
but then you look at like Chelsea Clinton,

3532
01:38:16,901 --> 01:38:19,090
she seems to be like a
fucking great person.

3533
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:23,020
All kinds of charity work
and daisy to be great.

3534
01:38:23,021 --> 01:38:24,120
And so you could serve as fallen.

3535
01:38:24,130 --> 01:38:25,230
You write checks in her house.

3536
01:38:25,390 --> 01:38:26,800
I think that sounds like a nightmare.

3537
01:38:28,090 --> 01:38:28,660
Yeah.

3538
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:29,740
Oh God.

3539
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:31,330
I wonder if the first time she got laid,

3540
01:38:31,630 --> 01:38:36,630
you imagine fucking her being the first
guy to fuck the daughter of a president.

3541
01:38:37,901 --> 01:38:38,680
How hard,

3542
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:41,380
cause usually you got to
sneak past her parents.

3543
01:38:41,590 --> 01:38:43,280
You've got to find a
place to hook up with her.

3544
01:38:43,281 --> 01:38:44,500
You got to borrow a car,

3545
01:38:44,590 --> 01:38:45,423
get a condom.

3546
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:46,330
This tuck,

3547
01:38:46,330 --> 01:38:48,810
you're beating the secret
service to get away.

3548
01:38:50,950 --> 01:38:52,990
You've got to be a stud.

3549
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:53,491
Yeah.

3550
01:38:53,491 --> 01:38:57,600
You gotta be a good climber or
you got to bring them hookers.

3551
01:38:58,530 --> 01:38:58,980
Yeah.

3552
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:00,150
You've got to give them something.

3553
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:01,140
You got to help them out.

3554
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:02,450
Dave,

3555
01:39:02,450 --> 01:39:03,680
there was a movie about that,

3556
01:39:03,681 --> 01:39:04,610
but they didn't do it right.

3557
01:39:04,790 --> 01:39:05,623
What was the movie?

3558
01:39:05,870 --> 01:39:06,471
Uh,

3559
01:39:06,471 --> 01:39:07,730
it was with um,

3560
01:39:09,290 --> 01:39:10,940
fuck why'd I think there's
probably been a combo,

3561
01:39:10,941 --> 01:39:12,710
but there was one with,

3562
01:39:13,390 --> 01:39:14,300
it's called first lady,

3563
01:39:14,301 --> 01:39:15,134
wasn't it?

3564
01:39:15,170 --> 01:39:19,190
There was a movie about the first lady
about her relationship with the secret

3565
01:39:19,191 --> 01:39:20,024
service.

3566
01:39:20,150 --> 01:39:20,840
Really?

3567
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:21,673
First Kid.

3568
01:39:22,070 --> 01:39:22,903
First Kid.

3569
01:39:23,410 --> 01:39:23,810
No,

3570
01:39:23,810 --> 01:39:25,670
that was some Shitty TV show,

3571
01:39:25,671 --> 01:39:26,504
wasn't it?

3572
01:39:26,630 --> 01:39:27,463
Is that a movie?

3573
01:39:28,150 --> 01:39:28,983
That

3574
01:39:31,490 --> 01:39:32,540
first kid?

3575
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:34,640
Sinbad,

3576
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:36,271
let me tell you some.

3577
01:39:36,271 --> 01:39:36,950
Mr. Benson.

3578
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:37,611
Sinbad,

3579
01:39:37,611 --> 01:39:38,444
you stick.

3580
01:39:38,850 --> 01:39:39,990
Oh,

3581
01:39:40,490 --> 01:39:43,220
and the history of killing
Sinbad was up there.

3582
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:43,880
Really?

3583
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:48,440
I mean not that they were not then it
was like a crowd that necessarily they

3584
01:39:48,441 --> 01:39:49,670
were there to see Sinbad,

3585
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:54,880
but I mean his energy and his salesmanship
crowds lost their shit for sin.

3586
01:39:56,021 --> 01:39:56,854
Bad.

3587
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:01,520
I've never watched Sinbad do stand
up maybe on TV for a couple seconds.

3588
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:05,270
Pacing the stage and going
big and the MC hammer pants.

3589
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:06,133
Right.

3590
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,050
Does that guy still around Sinbad?

3591
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:09,730
Yeah,

3592
01:40:09,730 --> 01:40:10,563
it's still torn.

3593
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:11,091
I've seen it.

3594
01:40:11,091 --> 01:40:12,800
I've seen his picture up in comedy clubs,

3595
01:40:12,801 --> 01:40:14,000
comedy clubs.

3596
01:40:14,930 --> 01:40:15,531
That's a thing.

3597
01:40:15,531 --> 01:40:16,730
You move up to theaters.

3598
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:18,950
It's a big jump man.

3599
01:40:18,951 --> 01:40:20,990
Cause then someday you
could be back in clubs.

3600
01:40:21,530 --> 01:40:22,363
I still do both.

3601
01:40:22,490 --> 01:40:22,791
Yeah.

3602
01:40:22,791 --> 01:40:23,450
That's the key.

3603
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:24,980
You got to look up the leg in both worlds.

3604
01:40:25,540 --> 01:40:26,750
Well I like clubs.

3605
01:40:26,810 --> 01:40:28,850
I liked the experience of doing clubs.

3606
01:40:28,851 --> 01:40:29,684
Actually better.

3607
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:30,860
You write more material there?

3608
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:31,381
Yeah,

3609
01:40:31,381 --> 01:40:32,150
I'll fuck around more.

3610
01:40:32,150 --> 01:40:32,750
Yeah.

3611
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:33,051
Like,

3612
01:40:33,051 --> 01:40:33,530
um,

3613
01:40:33,530 --> 01:40:35,360
this weekend I'm doing a San Jose Improv.

3614
01:40:35,470 --> 01:40:36,520
Are you on?

3615
01:40:36,521 --> 01:40:37,490
That's like a theater.

3616
01:40:38,430 --> 01:40:39,730
That's such a beautiful

3617
01:40:40,210 --> 01:40:42,650
Molly doing it Friday night cause
it's a UFC there Saturday night.

3618
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:43,130
Okay.

3619
01:40:43,130 --> 01:40:44,690
That's why I'm in San
Jose in the first place.

3620
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:45,110
Yeah.

3621
01:40:45,110 --> 01:40:46,010
But I love that club.

3622
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:46,551
That's a great,

3623
01:40:46,551 --> 01:40:46,660
cool.

3624
01:40:46,660 --> 01:40:47,421
I just did Zane.

3625
01:40:47,421 --> 01:40:48,350
He's in Nashville.

3626
01:40:48,410 --> 01:40:48,740
Yeah.

3627
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:49,580
Did that recently.

3628
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:50,540
I don't know if I ever did that,

3629
01:40:51,050 --> 01:40:51,800
but then I'm like,

3630
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:52,220
you know,

3631
01:40:52,220 --> 01:40:53,090
I've got a couple of theaters,

3632
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:57,180
Vancouver Theater and Winnipeg.

3633
01:40:57,860 --> 01:40:59,250
I do Chicago theater.

3634
01:40:59,251 --> 01:40:59,790
I do,

3635
01:40:59,790 --> 01:41:00,630
I do a lot of theaters,

3636
01:41:00,631 --> 01:41:01,930
but I also do clubs too.

3637
01:41:02,430 --> 01:41:04,260
And I do the clubs on purpose.

3638
01:41:04,261 --> 01:41:09,150
Like I decide like it'd be fun to
just go do a club just to fuck around.

3639
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:10,050
It's like just,

3640
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:11,910
I still love that experience,

3641
01:41:11,911 --> 01:41:12,720
that intimacy.

3642
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:13,560
Like a 200,

3643
01:41:13,561 --> 01:41:14,500
300 seat or something.

3644
01:41:14,501 --> 01:41:14,620
Like,

3645
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:14,810
yeah,

3646
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:17,170
I was on the road the last three
weeks and I've been writing like,

3647
01:41:17,171 --> 01:41:19,880
I've been so loving just recording my sat,

3648
01:41:19,881 --> 01:41:21,400
sitting in a hotel room alone,

3649
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:23,470
fucking just listening,

3650
01:41:23,471 --> 01:41:24,071
rewriting,

3651
01:41:24,071 --> 01:41:26,020
rewrite things because
you're like a philosopher.

3652
01:41:26,021 --> 01:41:30,700
You get to just think about shit you
care about and then bring it on stage.

3653
01:41:30,701 --> 01:41:32,710
And I just did such an amazing,

3654
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,460
you know,

3655
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:34,030
uh,

3656
01:41:34,030 --> 01:41:35,770
we're just so lucky to be able to do that.

3657
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:36,311
Oh fuck.

3658
01:41:36,311 --> 01:41:37,080
Yeah.

3659
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:37,270
Yeah.

3660
01:41:37,270 --> 01:41:38,290
It's the greatest gig ever.

3661
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:39,341
Speaking of waste,

3662
01:41:39,341 --> 01:41:40,091
can I plug a couple?

3663
01:41:40,091 --> 01:41:40,220
I'm,

3664
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:40,900
yeah,

3665
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:43,870
I'll be at Cap City Comedy Club in Austin.

3666
01:41:43,871 --> 01:41:45,970
There's this thing called
the monsoon comedy festival.

3667
01:41:46,930 --> 01:41:51,790
I'm going to be there and a
April 24th through the 27th.

3668
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:52,930
And then,

3669
01:41:52,930 --> 01:41:53,500
um,

3670
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:54,310
like I said,

3671
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:54,940
uh,

3672
01:41:54,940 --> 01:41:55,391
if you,

3673
01:41:55,391 --> 01:41:57,530
if you want to get your head out of the,

3674
01:41:57,531 --> 01:41:59,260
a shitty situation in Boston,

3675
01:41:59,650 --> 01:42:00,190
uh,

3676
01:42:00,190 --> 01:42:01,023
we'd love to,

3677
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:04,180
I'd love to be a part of
some kind of communal,

3678
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:04,990
uh,

3679
01:42:04,990 --> 01:42:07,630
experience with you in Boston
at Nick's this weekend.

3680
01:42:07,631 --> 01:42:07,991
And again,

3681
01:42:07,991 --> 01:42:11,470
if you bought tickets and you're feeling
like that's not the place you want to

3682
01:42:11,471 --> 01:42:12,160
be,

3683
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:14,200
a refunds are available,

3684
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:15,071
uh,

3685
01:42:15,071 --> 01:42:16,540
we will facilitate that.

3686
01:42:16,690 --> 01:42:17,500
Um,

3687
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:21,550
whatever terms you want to come
down with will make the best of it.

3688
01:42:21,580 --> 01:42:22,450
She almost go on

3689
01:42:22,620 --> 01:42:26,100
powerful Greg Fitzsimmons
house letting bitches.

3690
01:42:26,101 --> 01:42:26,770
No.

3691
01:42:26,770 --> 01:42:27,450
All right.

3692
01:42:27,450 --> 01:42:28,283
Right.

3693
01:42:28,940 --> 01:42:29,890
Ice House coming up.

3694
01:42:30,430 --> 01:42:30,941
Um,

3695
01:42:30,941 --> 01:42:32,230
I don't have one there this week.

3696
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:32,950
Um,

3697
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:34,000
this weekend I'm doing,

3698
01:42:34,001 --> 01:42:34,421
like I said,

3699
01:42:34,421 --> 01:42:36,370
I'm doing San Jose and then,

3700
01:42:36,371 --> 01:42:36,730
uh,

3701
01:42:36,730 --> 01:42:40,690
next week I'm doing a theater
in New Brunswick back in Jersey,

3702
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:42,131
jersey,

3703
01:42:42,131 --> 01:42:43,030
dirty jersey,

3704
01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:44,710
letting p below.

3705
01:42:45,070 --> 01:42:48,070
There's a certain authenticity to the
east coast that I do appreciate it

3706
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,480
when I go to visit Jersey.

3707
01:42:50,481 --> 01:42:51,620
Crowds are like,

3708
01:42:51,950 --> 01:42:53,870
you gotta earn it and
then they give it to you.

3709
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:54,320
Oh yeah.

3710
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:55,430
They're not handing it out.

3711
01:42:55,970 --> 01:42:56,810
They have a hard life.

3712
01:42:57,110 --> 01:42:57,861
When he got a hard life,

3713
01:42:57,861 --> 01:43:00,140
you'll live at Jersey even if
you live in a mansion in Jersey.

3714
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:03,830
I know poor people live in mansions
in New Jersey still in Jersey.

3715
01:43:03,831 --> 01:43:04,664
Bitch,

3716
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,090
is Diaz coming with you on that?

3717
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:07,270
Diaz is coming with me.

3718
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:07,930
Of course.

3719
01:43:07,930 --> 01:43:10,080
I'll go over and then Anya,

3720
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:11,180
when you're there in Vancouver,

3721
01:43:11,181 --> 01:43:12,050
it's going to be you,

3722
01:43:12,051 --> 01:43:12,884
me and Ari.

3723
01:43:13,970 --> 01:43:15,170
We're gonna have some fun up there.

3724
01:43:16,390 --> 01:43:17,101
How often do you go up to her?

3725
01:43:17,101 --> 01:43:17,934
To Canada?

3726
01:43:17,990 --> 01:43:18,823
I've,

3727
01:43:19,090 --> 01:43:20,380
I went to a wedding there this summer.

3728
01:43:20,381 --> 01:43:22,960
It's for some ever went what to Vancouver.

3729
01:43:23,170 --> 01:43:23,330
Oh,

3730
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:24,340
it fell in love with it.

3731
01:43:24,341 --> 01:43:25,060
I want to work.

3732
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:26,290
There's a club up there,

3733
01:43:26,770 --> 01:43:28,240
but I don't know what it is.

3734
01:43:28,241 --> 01:43:29,740
But if you're listening to on her,

3735
01:43:29,741 --> 01:43:30,670
I want to fucking work there.

3736
01:43:30,730 --> 01:43:33,350
You were just lying about all that
shit you were saying about Canada or,

3737
01:43:33,351 --> 01:43:33,681
right,

3738
01:43:33,681 --> 01:43:33,941
right,

3739
01:43:33,941 --> 01:43:34,241
right.

3740
01:43:34,241 --> 01:43:35,410
I've been there now.

3741
01:43:35,411 --> 01:43:37,150
I did nice last winter.

3742
01:43:37,151 --> 01:43:38,860
I was there and it was fucking ice.

3743
01:43:38,890 --> 01:43:39,551
It was ice.

3744
01:43:39,551 --> 01:43:41,530
The entire streets was an inch of ice.

3745
01:43:41,531 --> 01:43:42,580
Nobody could get around.

3746
01:43:42,990 --> 01:43:43,381
And then,

3747
01:43:43,381 --> 01:43:43,850
uh,

3748
01:43:43,850 --> 01:43:46,510
and then I think I'm doing the
Montreal comedy festival this summer.

3749
01:43:46,730 --> 01:43:47,291
Come a year.

3750
01:43:47,291 --> 01:43:48,940
Was it just like January?

3751
01:43:49,070 --> 01:43:49,361
Oh,

3752
01:43:49,361 --> 01:43:50,890
so it must be like 30 below rite.

3753
01:43:50,970 --> 01:43:51,211
Yeah.

3754
01:43:51,211 --> 01:43:55,430
And it snowed and then it rained and
melted and then the whole thing froze for

3755
01:43:55,431 --> 01:43:56,870
the three days I was there.

3756
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:57,861
I was literally like,

3757
01:43:57,861 --> 01:43:59,660
they would pick me up and it was like a,

3758
01:43:59,870 --> 01:44:02,780
it was a mile away and we
just fish tail the entire way.

3759
01:44:02,810 --> 01:44:07,250
But you know what place was jammed because
it's all these guys that work on oil

3760
01:44:07,251 --> 01:44:12,251
rigs outside of Edmonton and they got
like cowboy money and they come out at

3761
01:44:12,951 --> 01:44:14,030
night and they're like,

3762
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:15,080
my agent was like,

3763
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:16,670
you're going to sell cds after the show.

3764
01:44:16,671 --> 01:44:16,971
I was like,

3765
01:44:16,971 --> 01:44:17,211
yeah,

3766
01:44:17,211 --> 01:44:17,601
probably.

3767
01:44:17,601 --> 01:44:18,170
He goes,

3768
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:20,000
bring every single one that you have.

3769
01:44:20,330 --> 01:44:22,550
I brought like a hundred cds,

3770
01:44:22,551 --> 01:44:23,361
which I usually,

3771
01:44:23,361 --> 01:44:24,770
I'll bring like maybe 30.

3772
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,260
I sold out after two fucking nights.

3773
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:28,160
Wow.

3774
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:30,740
It was like they just have
cast their thrown today.

3775
01:44:30,810 --> 01:44:31,620
Yeah.

3776
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:32,690
It's amazing.

3777
01:44:33,670 --> 01:44:36,800
It's cold as fuck the Ark.

3778
01:44:36,990 --> 01:44:39,640
I talked to some guys that were up
there and they were explaining to me,

3779
01:44:39,641 --> 01:44:43,720
they're working on an oil rig all through
the winter and it's always outside and

3780
01:44:43,721 --> 01:44:44,230
uh,

3781
01:44:44,230 --> 01:44:44,531
you know,

3782
01:44:44,531 --> 01:44:46,690
it got 50 gets 50 below.

3783
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:47,531
So I was like,

3784
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:47,621
well,

3785
01:44:47,621 --> 01:44:49,240
what do you do when it gets that cold?

3786
01:44:49,241 --> 01:44:49,541
He's like,

3787
01:44:49,541 --> 01:44:52,360
you can only go out for a couple of
minutes at a time and then you go,

3788
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:55,630
what you do is you pull the truck up
like they're working on like these

3789
01:44:55,631 --> 01:44:56,500
electrical systems.

3790
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:57,730
You pull the truck up,

3791
01:44:58,090 --> 01:44:59,140
you get out of the truck,

3792
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:02,290
you're fully loaded like
giant gloves and mittens,

3793
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:02,681
the whole thing.

3794
01:45:02,681 --> 01:45:03,880
You can't take the gloves off.

3795
01:45:04,270 --> 01:45:05,103
You get there.

3796
01:45:05,150 --> 01:45:09,020
Then you try to do work as much as you
can fill a couple minutes and then he

3797
01:45:09,021 --> 01:45:10,270
jumped in the car for half an hour.

3798
01:45:10,430 --> 01:45:12,390
How man?

3799
01:45:12,850 --> 01:45:13,800
And they keep doing it.

3800
01:45:14,270 --> 01:45:15,103
Yeah,

3801
01:45:17,110 --> 01:45:17,943
that's it.

3802
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:19,210
That's why you know if you work,

3803
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:22,180
you could be a school teacher there
and you're making like 80 grand a year,

3804
01:45:22,630 --> 01:45:24,790
a hundred grand a year and
you fucking deserve it.

3805
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:25,500
Right.

3806
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:26,910
You don't want to do it when,

3807
01:45:26,911 --> 01:45:27,240
when,

3808
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:28,920
when you could literally die.

3809
01:45:29,070 --> 01:45:31,470
If you get stuck outside in Boston,

3810
01:45:31,471 --> 01:45:32,580
you can get cold.

3811
01:45:32,610 --> 01:45:32,851
Yeah,

3812
01:45:32,851 --> 01:45:33,684
it would suck.

3813
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:35,430
I guess you could die,

3814
01:45:35,431 --> 01:45:36,690
but probably,

3815
01:45:36,930 --> 01:45:37,763
Nah,

3816
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:39,390
probably not going to die now.

3817
01:45:39,410 --> 01:45:42,950
And it's also the cost of living up there
is because there's so much money to be

3818
01:45:42,951 --> 01:45:43,670
made.

3819
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:45,740
Somebody like if you want to
buy like a two bedroom condo,

3820
01:45:45,741 --> 01:45:48,610
it's like $1 million Edmonton.

3821
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:49,400
Yeah.

3822
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:51,230
Jesus around nothing.

3823
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:52,011
There's no sites.

3824
01:45:52,011 --> 01:45:52,671
There's no lake,

3825
01:45:52,671 --> 01:45:53,331
there's no skiing.

3826
01:45:53,331 --> 01:45:54,500
It's just flat.

3827
01:45:54,530 --> 01:45:55,281
Nothing land.

3828
01:45:55,281 --> 01:45:58,760
But it happens to be commuting distance
to where you can be a maid and make six

3829
01:45:58,761 --> 01:45:59,594
figures.

3830
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:01,940
I betcha it's insulated as fuck though.

3831
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:02,833
Talia,

3832
01:46:02,890 --> 01:46:03,920
the California,

3833
01:46:03,921 --> 01:46:06,050
like that was one of the
things that I'd work on this.

3834
01:46:06,051 --> 01:46:06,700
Um,

3835
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:07,040
this,

3836
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:08,300
the first house that I had,

3837
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:09,210
I was like,

3838
01:46:09,210 --> 01:46:09,760
uh,

3839
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:11,010
I did something to the wall.

3840
01:46:11,011 --> 01:46:13,210
So I was trying to fix it
and it was like the snow,

3841
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:14,530
listen,

3842
01:46:14,530 --> 01:46:16,210
I didn't even use installation.

3843
01:46:16,550 --> 01:46:17,171
Not only that,

3844
01:46:17,171 --> 01:46:18,070
but like in Venice,

3845
01:46:18,071 --> 01:46:18,501
like it,

3846
01:46:18,501 --> 01:46:18,880
it's,

3847
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:19,960
it's not bedrock.

3848
01:46:19,961 --> 01:46:22,030
So some stuff shifts in my house.

3849
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:24,460
All the windows are like trapezoids.

3850
01:46:24,490 --> 01:46:27,550
So the wind just comes right
underneath the panes of glass.

3851
01:46:27,940 --> 01:46:28,773
It's that bad.

3852
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:30,720
Yeah,

3853
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:31,840
it's like a good,

3854
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:36,040
it's a good half inch on each
side of every single window.

3855
01:46:36,430 --> 01:46:40,390
And the only thing you could do is rip
out all your windows and put in new ones,

3856
01:46:40,391 --> 01:46:41,440
which we were like,

3857
01:46:41,441 --> 01:46:41,951
fuck it.

3858
01:46:41,951 --> 01:46:44,230
I mean we're not going to do that and
it will fuzzy thing on the bottom.

3859
01:46:44,231 --> 01:46:46,180
You know the installation strip things,

3860
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:49,860
they have these things that stick on
the bottom of your window that have

3861
01:46:50,180 --> 01:46:51,570
like to just seal it tighter.

3862
01:46:51,770 --> 01:46:55,470
Like it's really popular in Ohio where
he gets really cold and when it comes

3863
01:46:55,471 --> 01:46:56,304
through your cracks,

3864
01:46:56,460 --> 01:46:58,800
so they have like these little
strips that you might run in windows.

3865
01:46:59,070 --> 01:47:00,090
Let's put a couple on those

3866
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:00,670
chat,

3867
01:47:00,670 --> 01:47:01,600
grow a mullet with that,

3868
01:47:01,710 --> 01:47:02,870
but an engine block of my friend.

3869
01:47:03,260 --> 01:47:04,830
What do you eat and nothing.

3870
01:47:06,380 --> 01:47:07,640
What do you mean nothing?

3871
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:08,721
You eat my cookies.

3872
01:47:08,721 --> 01:47:09,170
You Fuck?

3873
01:47:09,170 --> 01:47:09,351
No,

3874
01:47:09,351 --> 01:47:09,830
not cooking.

3875
01:47:09,830 --> 01:47:10,663
There was a cupcake.

3876
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:12,133
You ate the cupcakes?

3877
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:13,030
No.

3878
01:47:13,030 --> 01:47:13,280
Cupcake.

3879
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:13,760
Sinner.

3880
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:14,090
God,

3881
01:47:14,090 --> 01:47:15,120
you guys are like a married.

3882
01:47:17,550 --> 01:47:18,790
We got some delicious cupcakes.

3883
01:47:19,090 --> 01:47:19,881
What was the name of the place?

3884
01:47:19,881 --> 01:47:20,714
We just give a shout out.

3885
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:21,080
Yeah.

3886
01:47:21,080 --> 01:47:23,300
Nothing Bundt cakes.

3887
01:47:26,370 --> 01:47:28,770
Nothing Bundt u n d t cakes.

3888
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:29,011
Yeah.

3889
01:47:29,011 --> 01:47:33,840
I would say hairstyling salons and and
cupcake shops have the cutest names.

3890
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:35,010
They're brutal.

3891
01:47:35,010 --> 01:47:35,390
Yeah.

3892
01:47:35,390 --> 01:47:35,580
Yeah.

3893
01:47:35,580 --> 01:47:38,570
It's can never be like Bob's bakery often.

3894
01:47:38,610 --> 01:47:39,031
Muffin,

3895
01:47:39,031 --> 01:47:39,864
honey,

3896
01:47:40,690 --> 01:47:41,620
Suzy q's.

3897
01:47:41,710 --> 01:47:42,580
You ever have those?

3898
01:47:42,650 --> 01:47:42,760
Yeah.

3899
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:43,451
Those will put you into a,

3900
01:47:43,451 --> 01:47:44,090
God damn sure.

3901
01:47:44,090 --> 01:47:44,800
Call me.

3902
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:45,970
Oh yeah,

3903
01:47:45,971 --> 01:47:46,151
they're,

3904
01:47:46,151 --> 01:47:49,060
they're like a custom
made a cupcake company.

3905
01:47:49,061 --> 01:47:49,301
You know,

3906
01:47:49,301 --> 01:47:49,751
they like,

3907
01:47:49,751 --> 01:47:50,470
uh,

3908
01:47:50,470 --> 01:47:50,821
they,

3909
01:47:50,821 --> 01:47:51,160
they,

3910
01:47:51,160 --> 01:47:51,980
they just,

3911
01:47:51,980 --> 01:47:54,700
they're ridiculously rich
and you bite into it.

3912
01:47:54,701 --> 01:47:54,821
It's,

3913
01:47:54,821 --> 01:47:55,590
I can't dot.

3914
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:55,990
Yeah.

3915
01:47:55,990 --> 01:47:56,230
Can't,

3916
01:47:56,230 --> 01:47:56,831
has plans.

3917
01:47:56,831 --> 01:47:57,100
I mean,

3918
01:47:57,100 --> 01:47:58,450
I really am like that now.

3919
01:47:58,451 --> 01:47:59,201
I'm at the point where like,

3920
01:47:59,201 --> 01:48:01,060
if I'm going to have a big piece of cake,

3921
01:48:01,061 --> 01:48:02,500
I have to think I got a map out.

3922
01:48:02,710 --> 01:48:03,880
What do they got planned after this?

3923
01:48:03,881 --> 01:48:04,714
Yeah.

3924
01:48:06,370 --> 01:48:07,061
Isn't it funny though,

3925
01:48:07,061 --> 01:48:10,510
that you're willing to do that just for
that sensation of sugar and sweetness

3926
01:48:10,511 --> 01:48:13,090
and richness and moistness and Oh,

3927
01:48:13,091 --> 01:48:14,650
a big piece of chocolate cake,

3928
01:48:14,830 --> 01:48:15,940
especially with ice cream.

3929
01:48:15,950 --> 01:48:16,120
Like,

3930
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:16,870
ah,

3931
01:48:16,870 --> 01:48:17,740
why you're doing it.

3932
01:48:17,741 --> 01:48:18,461
You're loving it.

3933
01:48:18,461 --> 01:48:19,750
You're fucking loving it.

3934
01:48:20,230 --> 01:48:21,790
But then after wears off,

3935
01:48:21,970 --> 01:48:22,870
what a terrible,

3936
01:48:22,871 --> 01:48:23,704
terrible feeling.

3937
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:23,871
No,

3938
01:48:23,871 --> 01:48:24,091
and I,

3939
01:48:24,091 --> 01:48:25,250
I realized like a year ago,

3940
01:48:25,251 --> 01:48:29,900
I'm lactose intolerant and now I'll still
eat an ice cream cone with my kids and

3941
01:48:29,901 --> 01:48:33,860
then just rip far like two days
and they get worse and worse.

3942
01:48:33,861 --> 01:48:36,710
I get stomach cramps and
I'll still eat an ice cream.

3943
01:48:37,090 --> 01:48:37,923
I'm the same way.

3944
01:48:37,950 --> 01:48:41,400
I'm saying I still eat ice cream
and stuff and it just makes me shit.

3945
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:46,320
When you think about like how little
time you get pleasure out of that,

3946
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:48,150
I mean you're going to
get pleasure out of her.

3947
01:48:48,151 --> 01:48:48,751
Like what is it,

3948
01:48:48,751 --> 01:48:50,640
five minutes to eat a dessert if that.

3949
01:48:50,770 --> 01:48:53,190
It's like sex after sex.

3950
01:48:53,191 --> 01:48:53,480
You're like,

3951
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:53,881
Oh man,

3952
01:48:53,881 --> 01:48:55,680
I'm still feeling amazing.

3953
01:48:55,710 --> 01:48:55,891
Well,

3954
01:48:55,891 --> 01:48:58,200
you don't feel like shit if you do.

3955
01:48:58,201 --> 01:48:59,280
You're doing it wrong.

3956
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:02,220
If you have sex and you feel
like you go know a sugar coma,

3957
01:49:02,221 --> 01:49:02,430
like,

3958
01:49:02,430 --> 01:49:03,900
Oh shit.

3959
01:49:03,930 --> 01:49:04,340
Like,

3960
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:04,630
yeah,

3961
01:49:04,630 --> 01:49:05,463
what are you doing?

3962
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,560
I still feel really good
about having sex yesterday.

3963
01:49:07,561 --> 01:49:09,510
Like I felt like this morning I was like,

3964
01:49:09,511 --> 01:49:09,721
God,

3965
01:49:09,721 --> 01:49:10,560
why do I feel so good?

3966
01:49:10,561 --> 01:49:10,861
And I was like,

3967
01:49:10,861 --> 01:49:12,210
did you not have a sex with Brian?

3968
01:49:12,570 --> 01:49:13,380
Right?

3969
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:15,590
If you're having sex with
a black cloud over my head,

3970
01:49:15,660 --> 01:49:17,100
giant dream I have.

3971
01:49:17,190 --> 01:49:19,140
I think I just have sex every day,

3972
01:49:19,141 --> 01:49:20,850
so it's not a fun thing anymore.

3973
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:21,721
I was like,

3974
01:49:21,721 --> 01:49:22,200
all right.

3975
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:23,033
Yeah.

3976
01:49:23,630 --> 01:49:25,040
Well maybe do you want it more than,

3977
01:49:25,041 --> 01:49:25,240
yeah,

3978
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:25,391
no,

3979
01:49:25,391 --> 01:49:25,930
I'm on the road.

3980
01:49:25,930 --> 01:49:26,451
I've been to Tony.

3981
01:49:26,451 --> 01:49:27,610
I've been on the road for three weeks.

3982
01:49:27,611 --> 01:49:29,470
So it's like I come
back and it's like boom,

3983
01:49:29,471 --> 01:49:30,304
I'm back,

3984
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:30,970
get to hey,

3985
01:49:30,970 --> 01:49:32,380
you know it builds up over the weekend.

3986
01:49:32,381 --> 01:49:33,070
Cause like I,

3987
01:49:33,070 --> 01:49:34,420
I get so depressed on the road,

3988
01:49:34,421 --> 01:49:39,421
I can't even jerk off a lot because the
crash after that to me is black cloud

3989
01:49:40,030 --> 01:49:41,350
and now I'm alone in a room.

3990
01:49:41,710 --> 01:49:44,500
Why don't you and I just checked on once
you're bringing somebody on the road

3991
01:49:44,501 --> 01:49:45,790
with you bring a friend.

3992
01:49:46,150 --> 01:49:46,511
I know,

3993
01:49:46,511 --> 01:49:47,070
I keep,

3994
01:49:47,070 --> 01:49:47,371
you know,

3995
01:49:47,371 --> 01:49:48,030
I don't know.

3996
01:49:48,030 --> 01:49:48,863
I don't know.

3997
01:49:49,650 --> 01:49:50,580
Then it's a whole thing.

3998
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:52,351
It's like I,

3999
01:49:52,351 --> 01:49:54,540
I kinda like the local
comics to be able to work.

4000
01:49:54,541 --> 01:49:56,940
I don't like to displace
them by bringing somebody in.

4001
01:49:57,270 --> 01:49:58,590
And then every time I
try to bring somebody,

4002
01:49:58,591 --> 01:49:59,610
it's like they call me,

4003
01:49:59,611 --> 01:49:59,821
we'll,

4004
01:49:59,821 --> 01:50:00,061
you know,

4005
01:50:00,061 --> 01:50:02,400
they're not going to give
me air fare and you know,

4006
01:50:02,401 --> 01:50:03,270
I want to get paid this.

4007
01:50:03,271 --> 01:50:03,571
And it's like,

4008
01:50:03,571 --> 01:50:05,850
well send them their agents and like,

4009
01:50:05,851 --> 01:50:06,684
I don't know,

4010
01:50:06,690 --> 01:50:07,201
but I should,

4011
01:50:07,201 --> 01:50:08,130
because I get depressed.

4012
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:10,830
You need to do something
after the show and you know,

4013
01:50:10,860 --> 01:50:11,650
during the day,

4014
01:50:11,650 --> 01:50:12,041
yeah.

4015
01:50:12,041 --> 01:50:13,080
Somebody to hang out.

4016
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:15,450
I know I went out with you
guys at time and I had a blast.

4017
01:50:15,451 --> 01:50:16,290
That was really fun.

4018
01:50:16,470 --> 01:50:16,771
Yeah.

4019
01:50:16,771 --> 01:50:17,600
That's the way to do it.

4020
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,120
Yeah.

4021
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:22,320
The way you're doing it by not
bringing opening acts that's archaic.

4022
01:50:22,380 --> 01:50:22,980
Right.

4023
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:24,030
Cause then it's not fun.

4024
01:50:24,180 --> 01:50:25,350
Like when we go on the road,

4025
01:50:25,380 --> 01:50:27,720
it's like a little party
and we go to Vancouver.

4026
01:50:27,721 --> 01:50:28,740
We're not going to be lonely.

4027
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:29,581
We're going to have fun.

4028
01:50:29,581 --> 01:50:32,360
We're going to go eat dinner
and party and you know,

4029
01:50:32,370 --> 01:50:33,121
we're gonna have some fun.

4030
01:50:33,121 --> 01:50:34,080
Do great shows.

4031
01:50:34,350 --> 01:50:35,430
You still have time to write.

4032
01:50:35,490 --> 01:50:36,230
It's not like,

4033
01:50:36,230 --> 01:50:36,630
um,

4034
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:36,811
yeah,

4035
01:50:36,811 --> 01:50:37,621
you have time to write.

4036
01:50:37,621 --> 01:50:38,454
I write at night.

4037
01:50:38,550 --> 01:50:39,480
I always write at night.

4038
01:50:39,510 --> 01:50:41,010
I tried to do some writing during the day,

4039
01:50:41,011 --> 01:50:43,080
but it's not my thing during the day.

4040
01:50:43,081 --> 01:50:44,160
I like to experience Shit.

4041
01:50:44,161 --> 01:50:48,390
So I have like a ritual and my ritual
is during the day I fuck off and do

4042
01:50:48,391 --> 01:50:49,260
whatever I want to do,

4043
01:50:49,380 --> 01:50:49,860
you know,

4044
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:50,670
or work,

4045
01:50:50,670 --> 01:50:50,881
you know,

4046
01:50:50,881 --> 01:50:51,541
if I have a job,

4047
01:50:51,541 --> 01:50:54,720
if I have a UFC gig or if I
like working on the new TV show.

4048
01:50:55,050 --> 01:50:55,711
But if it's,

4049
01:50:55,711 --> 01:50:56,220
um,

4050
01:50:56,220 --> 01:50:58,020
at nighttime that's when I write,

4051
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:00,900
I write like between my,

4052
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:03,360
I do my best shit between like
12 and four in the morning.

4053
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:04,730
That's when I just,

4054
01:51:04,730 --> 01:51:06,440
I feel like you just got off stage.

4055
01:51:06,590 --> 01:51:07,550
Juices are flowing.

4056
01:51:07,680 --> 01:51:07,891
Yeah.

4057
01:51:07,891 --> 01:51:08,431
It's that.

4058
01:51:08,431 --> 01:51:13,080
And also like I feel like
I can concentrate more if I
know that most people were

4059
01:51:13,081 --> 01:51:13,914
asleep.

4060
01:51:14,450 --> 01:51:15,160
Well,

4061
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:15,450
no,

4062
01:51:15,450 --> 01:51:16,080
if that makes sense.

4063
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:16,200
Yeah.

4064
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:17,350
You're not checking your email.

4065
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:18,980
No worried about if your
phone's going to ring.

4066
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,490
But it's not sad to say that I don't have
a lot of ideas that I generate during

4067
01:51:22,491 --> 01:51:22,911
the day,

4068
01:51:22,911 --> 01:51:25,670
but most of those wind
up on notepad and then I,

4069
01:51:25,671 --> 01:51:26,000
uh,

4070
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:26,300
you know,

4071
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:28,130
it took that little iPhone application.

4072
01:51:28,131 --> 01:51:30,890
I talk into it and then you know,

4073
01:51:30,891 --> 01:51:33,080
I at nighttime I go over all the notes.

4074
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:35,420
At nighttime we'll go over the recordings.

4075
01:51:35,450 --> 01:51:35,990
I just,

4076
01:51:35,990 --> 01:51:36,860
I like to do it,

4077
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:38,630
I like to do it before I go to bed.

4078
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:39,670
I feel like,

4079
01:51:39,670 --> 01:51:43,520
I feel like my brain makes the most
sense at the end of the day too.

4080
01:51:43,550 --> 01:51:48,550
Like if kind of like I have a better
perspective on things like I think it's

4081
01:51:49,401 --> 01:51:51,140
almost analogous to your life.

4082
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:53,210
Like as you get older,

4083
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:53,931
you know,

4084
01:51:53,931 --> 01:51:54,141
the,

4085
01:51:54,141 --> 01:51:55,070
the older you get,

4086
01:51:55,071 --> 01:51:58,790
the more you sort of are wise
to what the fuck's going on.

4087
01:51:59,180 --> 01:51:59,451
Well,

4088
01:51:59,451 --> 01:52:04,340
even throughout the day I feel like I'm
stupid or in the morning and I am at

4089
01:52:04,340 --> 01:52:04,580
night,

4090
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:04,851
you know,

4091
01:52:04,851 --> 01:52:08,090
if you asked me some really important
questions or you make me do an important

4092
01:52:08,091 --> 01:52:11,720
interview at 9:00 AM I might stumble
through that bitch and who knows what the

4093
01:52:11,721 --> 01:52:12,460
fuck outside

4094
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:13,770
warm up for a longer time,

4095
01:52:13,780 --> 01:52:14,501
like an old car,

4096
01:52:14,501 --> 01:52:16,180
you got to warm that fucking thing out.

4097
01:52:16,350 --> 01:52:17,260
Even when I was young,

4098
01:52:17,261 --> 01:52:18,920
I remember being stupid in the morning.

4099
01:52:18,950 --> 01:52:19,783
It's just dumb.

4100
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:20,770
It's just doesn't work that right.

4101
01:52:20,830 --> 01:52:21,220
Good.

4102
01:52:21,220 --> 01:52:22,030
Yeah.

4103
01:52:22,030 --> 01:52:22,690
You know,

4104
01:52:22,690 --> 01:52:24,310
when we did it Newton
podcast the other day,

4105
01:52:24,311 --> 01:52:25,300
I felt like that I was like,

4106
01:52:25,301 --> 01:52:26,230
my brain's not working.

4107
01:52:26,231 --> 01:52:27,370
I need a good three hours.

4108
01:52:27,371 --> 01:52:28,970
I need Starbucks in me already.

4109
01:52:28,971 --> 01:52:29,560
And you know,

4110
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:29,801
yeah.

4111
01:52:29,801 --> 01:52:33,160
It's like there's a process to
ramping up to the point where you're,

4112
01:52:33,161 --> 01:52:35,980
you're at 100% I don't
know how those guys,

4113
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:37,113
I mean I do know how,

4114
01:52:37,150 --> 01:52:39,160
cause I've done episodes of morning shows,

4115
01:52:39,161 --> 01:52:40,840
but I don't know how
God does that every day.

4116
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:41,521
Every day.

4117
01:52:41,521 --> 01:52:41,880
Yeah.

4118
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:42,990
I can gear up for it.

4119
01:52:42,991 --> 01:52:43,091
I,

4120
01:52:43,091 --> 01:52:45,030
I kind of like getting to a city,

4121
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:45,811
taking the challenge,

4122
01:52:45,811 --> 01:52:45,931
right.

4123
01:52:45,931 --> 01:52:49,710
We're going to do for radio shows in a
row and you go in there and fucking go.

4124
01:52:49,910 --> 01:52:50,731
All right guys,

4125
01:52:50,731 --> 01:52:50,941
let's,

4126
01:52:50,941 --> 01:52:51,960
you've had a lot of caffeine.

4127
01:52:51,961 --> 01:52:52,441
I haven't,

4128
01:52:52,441 --> 01:52:52,751
but I'll,

4129
01:52:52,751 --> 01:52:53,850
I'll ride the wave.

4130
01:52:54,220 --> 01:52:56,580
But then to do it for some of these guys,

4131
01:52:56,581 --> 01:52:58,050
five hours a day,

4132
01:52:58,051 --> 01:52:59,250
five days a week,

4133
01:52:59,310 --> 01:53:01,170
and a lot of functions on the weekends.

4134
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:02,760
The weekends they'll do stuff like,

4135
01:53:02,761 --> 01:53:03,210
uh,

4136
01:53:03,210 --> 01:53:03,781
it's wacky.

4137
01:53:03,781 --> 01:53:05,640
Bob's sideshow giveaway,

4138
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:07,050
the bull ranch.

4139
01:53:07,230 --> 01:53:07,960
Fuckhead

4140
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:08,540
yeah,

4141
01:53:08,540 --> 01:53:09,400
I've got a mattress,

4142
01:53:09,401 --> 01:53:13,510
salads I acid tonight because
they're not making shit on the radio.

4143
01:53:13,511 --> 01:53:14,620
So that's how they make their money.

4144
01:53:14,940 --> 01:53:16,980
I was listening to a radio
on the way over here.

4145
01:53:16,981 --> 01:53:19,050
I rarely listen to regular radio,

4146
01:53:19,350 --> 01:53:22,860
but it was a woman who was on and she
was talking about some new Ford car that

4147
01:53:22,861 --> 01:53:23,940
she got from this thing.

4148
01:53:24,210 --> 01:53:24,570
I'm like,

4149
01:53:24,570 --> 01:53:24,751
oh,

4150
01:53:24,751 --> 01:53:25,561
so that's what they're doing.

4151
01:53:25,561 --> 01:53:26,600
Like they're

4152
01:53:29,740 --> 01:53:30,573
always plugging that.

4153
01:53:30,690 --> 01:53:31,021
Yeah.

4154
01:53:31,021 --> 01:53:33,090
She was talking about this car
that she got from this deal.

4155
01:53:33,091 --> 01:53:33,330
I'm like,

4156
01:53:33,330 --> 01:53:33,841
well that's how,

4157
01:53:33,841 --> 01:53:35,460
I guess that's how you got to do it.

4158
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:36,030
Right.

4159
01:53:36,030 --> 01:53:36,601
That's how,

4160
01:53:36,601 --> 01:53:36,820
uh,

4161
01:53:36,820 --> 01:53:40,650
that's how they make that connection
that you make that advertising dollar.

4162
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:41,091
Yeah.

4163
01:53:41,091 --> 01:53:41,511
Well it's,

4164
01:53:41,511 --> 01:53:42,260
you know,

4165
01:53:42,260 --> 01:53:42,740
um,

4166
01:53:42,740 --> 01:53:44,240
fucking hard gig these days.

4167
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:45,800
I Dad did ready on my whole life.

4168
01:53:45,801 --> 01:53:46,101
He was,

4169
01:53:46,101 --> 01:53:51,101
he was on the air from he that he had a
spot that was 1130 to 3:00 AM you went

4170
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:53,480
in at 1130 in the morning.

4171
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:54,230
He get up.

4172
01:53:54,230 --> 01:53:54,411
Oh,

4173
01:53:54,411 --> 01:53:58,260
I thought you were [inaudible] 1130 to
three P I thought you were talking p

4174
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:00,080
11:30 AM so he'd get up,

4175
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:01,161
have his coffee,

4176
01:54:01,161 --> 01:54:01,371
you know,

4177
01:54:01,371 --> 01:54:04,820
we live 25 minutes from the
city and then he'd do that.

4178
01:54:05,060 --> 01:54:09,830
Go out for cocktails afterwards in the
city with friends coming home for dinner

4179
01:54:09,831 --> 01:54:11,300
or not usually not,

4180
01:54:11,301 --> 01:54:13,640
but it was fucking life.

4181
01:54:13,641 --> 01:54:15,380
But they paid money back then for radio.

4182
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:15,841
Yeah.

4183
01:54:15,841 --> 01:54:16,980
Back then there was no,

4184
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:17,790
you know,

4185
01:54:17,790 --> 01:54:19,230
there wasn't that many outlets.

4186
01:54:19,490 --> 01:54:22,350
So if you got a Gig and you
are proven to be successful,

4187
01:54:22,590 --> 01:54:23,101
like wow,

4188
01:54:23,101 --> 01:54:24,090
you had some leverage,

4189
01:54:24,091 --> 01:54:25,020
you have some power.

4190
01:54:25,110 --> 01:54:26,840
And remember Charles Laquidara chair.

4191
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:27,690
Yeah.

4192
01:54:27,690 --> 01:54:28,510
BCN.

4193
01:54:28,510 --> 01:54:29,343
Yeah.

4194
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:30,360
And Mark Parenteau.

4195
01:54:30,870 --> 01:54:31,320
Yeah,

4196
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:32,460
I emailed with him sometimes.

4197
01:54:32,470 --> 01:54:32,830
Yeah.

4198
01:54:32,830 --> 01:54:33,330
Yeah.

4199
01:54:33,330 --> 01:54:33,990
How's he doing?

4200
01:54:33,990 --> 01:54:34,823
He's doing all right.

4201
01:54:34,980 --> 01:54:35,281
You know,

4202
01:54:35,281 --> 01:54:36,270
just get his head on straight.

4203
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:37,350
Who's a big comedy fan?

4204
01:54:37,390 --> 01:54:37,770
Oh,

4205
01:54:37,770 --> 01:54:38,603
very supportive.

4206
01:54:38,610 --> 01:54:38,881
Yeah,

4207
01:54:38,881 --> 01:54:39,440
that guy.

4208
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:41,940
All those guys like the BCN comedy riot.

4209
01:54:42,210 --> 01:54:43,710
When we were in Boston,

4210
01:54:43,711 --> 01:54:44,331
the number one,

4211
01:54:44,331 --> 01:54:49,260
a rock station was WBCN and they had
this BCN comedy riot and every year they

4212
01:54:49,261 --> 01:54:51,180
would have this a comedy competition.

4213
01:54:51,870 --> 01:54:56,580
And it made a break make was a make or
break situation for a lot of young comics

4214
01:54:56,581 --> 01:54:57,170
at the time.

4215
01:54:57,170 --> 01:55:01,760
The only way to really move out of being
an open miker into being an an opening

4216
01:55:01,761 --> 01:55:02,330
act.

4217
01:55:02,330 --> 01:55:03,200
It was huge.

4218
01:55:03,230 --> 01:55:03,860
Yeah.

4219
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:04,693
And so,

4220
01:55:04,850 --> 01:55:05,683
and you can't,

4221
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:08,270
you can't overstate how
big BCN was in Boston.

4222
01:55:08,271 --> 01:55:10,760
It was so much bigger than
the other radio stations.

4223
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,230
And they were very generous.

4224
01:55:12,231 --> 01:55:13,064
They would put on this,

4225
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:13,790
uh,

4226
01:55:13,790 --> 01:55:14,780
what was the thing with the,

4227
01:55:14,781 --> 01:55:15,110
uh,

4228
01:55:15,110 --> 01:55:18,980
the bands to the battle of the bands and
then they do the same thing for comedy

4229
01:55:18,981 --> 01:55:20,060
where you'd start out and I mean,

4230
01:55:20,061 --> 01:55:21,620
I still have the card,

4231
01:55:21,770 --> 01:55:23,090
I got to make a copy of it for you.

4232
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:28,280
It was like the lineup for the entire
Boston comedy riot and it was me,

4233
01:55:29,151 --> 01:55:29,541
you,

4234
01:55:29,541 --> 01:55:34,541
Todd Parker and Robbie Printz
and Mike Lee and all these dudes.

4235
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:37,110
And I have your name and my name and,

4236
01:55:37,111 --> 01:55:37,821
and you know,

4237
01:55:37,821 --> 01:55:38,250
a,

4238
01:55:38,250 --> 01:55:40,340
and you're kind of competing
against each other.

4239
01:55:40,970 --> 01:55:44,240
And the guy that wanted our year I
think was like friendly or running

4240
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:45,610
McMann kind of man.

4241
01:55:45,620 --> 01:55:45,990
Yeah.

4242
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:46,823
Brent Mcmahon.

4243
01:55:47,070 --> 01:55:48,060
And then um,

4244
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:49,531
yeah,

4245
01:55:49,531 --> 01:55:51,090
it's like that was a,

4246
01:55:51,091 --> 01:55:52,440
that was the only way you were right.

4247
01:55:52,441 --> 01:55:55,290
That was the only way you actually
want up getting like paid gigs.

4248
01:55:55,470 --> 01:55:57,330
Like someone would see you
and say you're pretty good.

4249
01:55:57,331 --> 01:55:58,380
You know what you do.

4250
01:55:58,410 --> 01:55:58,830
You know,

4251
01:55:58,830 --> 01:56:00,240
Mc had a,

4252
01:56:00,250 --> 01:56:01,470
a local place.

4253
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:02,110
Yeah.

4254
01:56:02,110 --> 01:56:03,090
It was amazing times,

4255
01:56:03,091 --> 01:56:03,924
ma'am.

4256
01:56:04,410 --> 01:56:05,011
Amazing Times.

4257
01:56:05,011 --> 01:56:05,200
You were.

4258
01:56:05,200 --> 01:56:05,730
Stop,

4259
01:56:05,730 --> 01:56:06,870
stop and really think about it.

4260
01:56:08,060 --> 01:56:08,391
Yeah.

4261
01:56:08,391 --> 01:56:09,021
It's really,

4262
01:56:09,021 --> 01:56:09,854
um,

4263
01:56:10,730 --> 01:56:11,160
okay.

4264
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:16,080
It's a place in time that doesn't exist
anymore in terms of being able to watch

4265
01:56:16,081 --> 01:56:18,480
great comics that weren't
going any anywhere.

4266
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:18,870
You know,

4267
01:56:18,870 --> 01:56:20,040
it was like a club here.

4268
01:56:20,041 --> 01:56:20,461
We were in a,

4269
01:56:20,461 --> 01:56:22,470
in a great fucking club watching,

4270
01:56:22,740 --> 01:56:23,280
um,

4271
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:23,611
you know,

4272
01:56:23,611 --> 01:56:27,120
guys that were writing true to themselves.

4273
01:56:27,121 --> 01:56:27,331
Like,

4274
01:56:27,331 --> 01:56:28,320
nobody I've ever seen,

4275
01:56:28,321 --> 01:56:28,531
you know,

4276
01:56:28,531 --> 01:56:31,140
like a regional voices and uh,

4277
01:56:31,230 --> 01:56:33,390
it wasn't homogenized by
having to go to another,

4278
01:56:33,540 --> 01:56:33,721
you know,

4279
01:56:33,721 --> 01:56:34,440
try to like,

4280
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:36,600
well I'm going to get on the tonight
show or I'm going to get on a sitcom.

4281
01:56:36,601 --> 01:56:37,560
Nobody was thinking that way.

4282
01:56:37,561 --> 01:56:40,350
They were just thinking about like my act,

4283
01:56:40,351 --> 01:56:43,440
what I do on stage and how it can
be different than everybody else's.

4284
01:56:43,710 --> 01:56:46,590
And you know what's really
interesting is like there was,

4285
01:56:46,950 --> 01:56:51,210
we learn good things and we
also got to see pitfalls.

4286
01:56:51,630 --> 01:56:55,380
And one of the big pitfalls that we all
got to see our generation got to see was

4287
01:56:55,381 --> 01:56:56,640
the guy that didn't leave.

4288
01:56:57,270 --> 01:57:00,390
The guys that stuck around the guys
that were monsters and they were,

4289
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:03,300
there were headlines in this
town but they never broke free.

4290
01:57:03,570 --> 01:57:05,010
And those guys just,

4291
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:07,110
they became stagnant and they stopped.

4292
01:57:07,170 --> 01:57:10,500
And we also got to see the pitfall
of not writing new material.

4293
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:15,150
Those guys would get 20 minutes and
sharpen that fucking thing down to like a

4294
01:57:15,151 --> 01:57:18,550
Samurai sword cause fold
the blade and hammer it,

4295
01:57:18,570 --> 01:57:19,590
fold the blade in,

4296
01:57:19,610 --> 01:57:22,380
hammering until the point
where like Don Gavin,

4297
01:57:22,490 --> 01:57:22,860
we,

4298
01:57:22,860 --> 01:57:24,300
he was just,

4299
01:57:24,301 --> 01:57:25,620
it was an artisan,

4300
01:57:25,740 --> 01:57:25,951
right?

4301
01:57:25,951 --> 01:57:29,340
It was just like this guy who had
done this dance a thousand times.

4302
01:57:29,420 --> 01:57:32,180
I learned more from that guy
then any comic I've ever seen.

4303
01:57:32,570 --> 01:57:35,450
There's something to be said
for being able to do that,

4304
01:57:35,451 --> 01:57:40,040
to be able to have an act and have your
timing so good that you could say it

4305
01:57:40,041 --> 01:57:42,530
over and over and over and over
and over and over and over again.

4306
01:57:42,540 --> 01:57:43,670
It was still hilarious.

4307
01:57:43,700 --> 01:57:43,941
Right.

4308
01:57:43,941 --> 01:57:47,030
It's still sit in the back of the
room to watch jokes that we knew.

4309
01:57:47,540 --> 01:57:49,070
That whole thing about the lobster,

4310
01:57:49,370 --> 01:57:51,320
like a or that buffet.

4311
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:52,160
Yeah,

4312
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:52,851
the fucking,

4313
01:57:52,851 --> 01:57:53,510
the bib,

4314
01:57:53,510 --> 01:57:54,020
like the,

4315
01:57:54,020 --> 01:57:57,680
the sneeze guard they
put over the salad bar.

4316
01:57:57,790 --> 01:57:58,001
Yeah.

4317
01:57:58,001 --> 01:57:58,620
They put out,

4318
01:57:58,620 --> 01:58:00,400
they put all the good
shit in the back up front.

4319
01:58:00,401 --> 01:58:03,250
You got chickpeas and the back.

4320
01:58:03,310 --> 01:58:04,990
The last has given you the claw.

4321
01:58:07,090 --> 01:58:08,020
So it was,

4322
01:58:08,240 --> 01:58:11,390
it's so hard to explain to people
that weren't a part of that.

4323
01:58:11,391 --> 01:58:12,300
Like how magical they,

4324
01:58:12,310 --> 01:58:12,851
like people are say,

4325
01:58:12,851 --> 01:58:15,230
oh they're going to talk
about the old days again.

4326
01:58:15,530 --> 01:58:16,730
Like we,

4327
01:58:16,790 --> 01:58:19,010
we got super duper lucky.

4328
01:58:19,450 --> 01:58:23,870
We got as lucky as a human being could
get if they want it to be a comedian.

4329
01:58:23,900 --> 01:58:24,620
We were,

4330
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:29,620
we were in the born and the right time
and then in the 1960s so that when the

4331
01:58:30,441 --> 01:58:32,510
1980 comedy rush came around,

4332
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:34,790
we caught the second wave,

4333
01:58:34,820 --> 01:58:35,920
not the first wave.

4334
01:58:35,921 --> 01:58:40,010
We got to wash the first wave and then
we caught a second way and catching the

4335
01:58:40,011 --> 01:58:40,451
second way.

4336
01:58:40,451 --> 01:58:43,180
If you've got to see all the
fucking people that hit the rocks,

4337
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:45,700
you got to see all the people
that get hooked on drugs.

4338
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:49,000
He got to see all the people
that self saboteurs people,

4339
01:58:49,030 --> 01:58:49,940
the did the white material,

4340
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:52,640
how agents we're going to treat you.

4341
01:58:53,270 --> 01:58:58,270
We got to see Lenny Clarke got robbed
of a $250,000 remember that his agent,

4342
01:58:59,270 --> 01:59:03,470
you remember Lenny Clark's agent took
off with like a bunch of different

4343
01:59:03,471 --> 01:59:04,304
people's money.

4344
01:59:04,430 --> 01:59:05,200
Do you remember that?

4345
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:06,033
Yeah.

4346
01:59:06,050 --> 01:59:06,400
Yeah.

4347
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:08,150
Lenny lost a ridiculous amount.

4348
01:59:08,151 --> 01:59:10,280
A lot of people lost a lot of money.

4349
01:59:10,790 --> 01:59:11,260
Yeah.

4350
01:59:11,260 --> 01:59:12,093
It was like the,

4351
01:59:12,230 --> 01:59:12,670
I forget

4352
01:59:12,670 --> 01:59:13,810
the agency's name,

4353
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:18,400
Boston Agency and had his own TV show.

4354
01:59:18,460 --> 01:59:21,460
He had a TV show that agency left with.

4355
01:59:21,490 --> 01:59:21,760
Yeah,

4356
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:23,140
a bunch of comedians.

4357
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:25,320
Fucking stack of cash.

4358
01:59:25,470 --> 01:59:26,221
So we got to see,

4359
01:59:26,221 --> 01:59:28,100
I think Seinfeld lost money in that too.

4360
01:59:28,370 --> 01:59:29,490
I want to say I made it back.

4361
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:29,701
Well,

4362
01:59:29,701 --> 01:59:30,211
we are.

4363
01:59:30,211 --> 01:59:31,060
I'm thinking you might.

4364
01:59:31,690 --> 01:59:33,600
We all got to see all those,

4365
01:59:33,630 --> 01:59:35,400
those things that happened before us,

4366
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:36,293
you know,

4367
01:59:37,100 --> 01:59:40,010
and the realizing that a few drank
and drove and lost your license.

4368
01:59:40,190 --> 01:59:42,260
You ceased to be a
comedian in New England.

4369
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:43,250
Oh yeah.

4370
01:59:43,310 --> 01:59:44,001
Those guys.

4371
01:59:44,001 --> 01:59:46,700
That was one of the main things that
made me stop drinking because I stopped

4372
01:59:46,701 --> 01:59:47,301
after like a year.

4373
01:59:47,301 --> 01:59:47,810
I was like,

4374
01:59:47,810 --> 01:59:49,070
I can't fucking this.

4375
01:59:49,250 --> 01:59:50,750
I've been lucky so far,

4376
01:59:50,751 --> 01:59:51,650
drinking and driving,

4377
01:59:51,651 --> 01:59:53,820
but the comedy met too much to,

4378
01:59:53,830 --> 01:59:54,590
to gamble.

4379
01:59:54,590 --> 01:59:54,951
I was like,

4380
01:59:54,951 --> 01:59:56,150
I can't fucking do this.

4381
01:59:56,250 --> 01:59:56,431
Yeah.

4382
01:59:56,431 --> 02:00:00,480
If you had to do a Gig in Maine and you
needed to get someone to drive you or

4383
02:00:00,481 --> 02:00:01,051
five,

4384
02:00:01,051 --> 02:00:05,850
six hours and we were in the closers
then either like who drive the closer.

4385
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:06,250
Right.

4386
02:00:06,250 --> 02:00:06,710
Okay.

4387
02:00:06,710 --> 02:00:09,210
I remember a lot of
those gigs you would get,

4388
02:00:09,240 --> 02:00:14,010
whether it was Boston comedy or Dicta
rd or someone you had to like drive the

4389
02:00:14,011 --> 02:00:14,700
guy.

4390
02:00:14,700 --> 02:00:16,980
You would like pick up guys and drive them

4391
02:00:17,180 --> 02:00:18,170
and there was no,

4392
02:00:18,410 --> 02:00:22,280
I can remember maybe twice getting a hotel
room and all those years there was no

4393
02:00:22,281 --> 02:00:22,910
hotel.

4394
02:00:22,910 --> 02:00:24,050
You drove six hours,

4395
02:00:24,051 --> 02:00:25,640
so you did the Gig and you drove home.

4396
02:00:26,330 --> 02:00:27,620
We'll those gigs in Maine.

4397
02:00:27,740 --> 02:00:28,041
Yeah,

4398
02:00:28,041 --> 02:00:29,030
he didn't get hotel rooms.

4399
02:00:29,031 --> 02:00:30,540
When you worked in the Bangor notes,

4400
02:00:30,570 --> 02:00:31,640
only three and a half hour drive.

4401
02:00:31,641 --> 02:00:34,510
You Pussy try to bang a waitress
and I spend the night with him,

4402
02:00:34,530 --> 02:00:36,950
waitress sleeping your
guard for a couple hours,

4403
02:00:36,951 --> 02:00:37,820
get a truck,

4404
02:00:37,821 --> 02:00:39,380
stop coffee and power.

4405
02:00:39,381 --> 02:00:42,820
Through those moments we drive it home.

4406
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:45,500
You're slapping yourself in the
face just trying to stay awake.

4407
02:00:45,770 --> 02:00:46,211
Aw Man.

4408
02:00:46,211 --> 02:00:50,320
I did that and then I would drive from
Boston after I'd been doing stand up a

4409
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:50,321
few years,

4410
02:00:50,321 --> 02:00:54,880
I started going down in New York and
splitting the weeks I'd spend like Sunday,

4411
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:54,880
Monday,

4412
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:55,391
Tuesday in New York.

4413
02:00:55,391 --> 02:00:59,020
I come back to Boston during the weekends
and make some money and I would leave

4414
02:00:59,021 --> 02:01:00,730
whatever my show was on Saturday night,

4415
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:01,210
you know,

4416
02:01:01,210 --> 02:01:01,751
midnight,

4417
02:01:01,751 --> 02:01:02,291
one in the morning,

4418
02:01:02,291 --> 02:01:02,801
get in the car,

4419
02:01:02,801 --> 02:01:04,810
drive to New York and just,

4420
02:01:04,811 --> 02:01:05,140
yeah,

4421
02:01:05,140 --> 02:01:07,390
slapping myself in the face window,

4422
02:01:07,391 --> 02:01:09,160
open Holland over,

4423
02:01:09,161 --> 02:01:12,280
jumping up and down and
somehow making it to me open

4424
02:01:12,290 --> 02:01:13,123
a new lane.

4425
02:01:13,310 --> 02:01:14,570
Fuck Shit.

4426
02:01:14,850 --> 02:01:15,110
Yeah.

4427
02:01:15,110 --> 02:01:16,340
That's a terrible feeling,

4428
02:01:16,341 --> 02:01:16,610
man.

4429
02:01:16,610 --> 02:01:18,890
That is a terrible feeling
when you're falling asleep.

4430
02:01:18,891 --> 02:01:19,460
Driving.

4431
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:19,940
Yeah,

4432
02:01:19,940 --> 02:01:23,150
and so weird things like
something's happening with those,

4433
02:01:23,180 --> 02:01:27,440
those when you're sitting there and you
watching those white lines over and over

4434
02:01:27,441 --> 02:01:28,160
and over again,

4435
02:01:28,160 --> 02:01:32,510
it has this weird hypnotic thing because
if you just pull the car over and start

4436
02:01:32,511 --> 02:01:33,170
walking,

4437
02:01:33,170 --> 02:01:34,430
you would not fall asleep.

4438
02:01:35,180 --> 02:01:36,620
The same human being,

4439
02:01:36,650 --> 02:01:39,890
like just the act of walking
you would be to concentrate,

4440
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:43,970
but sitting in that car and just steering
and touching the gas is not enough.

4441
02:01:44,340 --> 02:01:45,920
It's all and the sound.

4442
02:01:45,921 --> 02:01:49,780
It's like everything
about it is just like a,

4443
02:01:49,790 --> 02:01:50,001
I mean,

4444
02:01:50,001 --> 02:01:52,370
think about when you're in a
passenger seat on a trip like that,

4445
02:01:52,490 --> 02:01:54,230
you're going to be awake
for about nine minutes.

4446
02:01:55,170 --> 02:01:55,600
Yeah,

4447
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:56,470
same experience.

4448
02:01:57,340 --> 02:01:58,690
You're going to stay awake and talk to me,

4449
02:01:58,691 --> 02:01:59,081
right?

4450
02:01:59,081 --> 02:01:59,321
Yeah,

4451
02:01:59,321 --> 02:01:59,411
yeah,

4452
02:01:59,411 --> 02:02:00,244
yeah

4453
02:02:01,090 --> 02:02:01,650
ma'am.

4454
02:02:01,650 --> 02:02:03,930
Friends would always
conk out and road trips.

4455
02:02:03,931 --> 02:02:04,830
That shit was brutal.

4456
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:06,910
Thank God they invited
those that they invented,

4457
02:02:06,911 --> 02:02:10,030
those little reflectors that
make bumps on your tires,

4458
02:02:10,380 --> 02:02:11,950
that saved a lot of lives.

4459
02:02:12,240 --> 02:02:13,550
Ridges on the side of the road and go,

4460
02:02:14,610 --> 02:02:15,241
you're fucking up.

4461
02:02:15,241 --> 02:02:16,074
You're fucking out.

4462
02:02:16,140 --> 02:02:17,130
Gives you a chance,

4463
02:02:17,710 --> 02:02:19,510
gives you a chance instead
of just a guard rail,

4464
02:02:19,511 --> 02:02:20,590
it's going to make you flip them.

4465
02:02:20,591 --> 02:02:21,370
Fly through.

4466
02:02:21,370 --> 02:02:22,091
I fell asleep.

4467
02:02:22,091 --> 02:02:23,710
Lots behind the wheel crashing.

4468
02:02:23,790 --> 02:02:24,580
Yeah.

4469
02:02:24,580 --> 02:02:24,731
Yeah.

4470
02:02:24,731 --> 02:02:25,421
I was down in,

4471
02:02:25,421 --> 02:02:25,750
uh,

4472
02:02:25,750 --> 02:02:29,410
one summer I was in Newport and I got
in a fight and I got thrown in jail for

4473
02:02:29,411 --> 02:02:34,090
the weekend and then I had to go back
to my court appearance in the fall.

4474
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:35,160
So I borrowed my,

4475
02:02:35,160 --> 02:02:39,040
my ex girlfriend's car to go to the
court appearance and I'm out the night

4476
02:02:39,041 --> 02:02:41,620
before fucking drinking straight through,

4477
02:02:41,650 --> 02:02:42,483
didn't sleep,

4478
02:02:42,760 --> 02:02:43,630
get her car.

4479
02:02:43,810 --> 02:02:45,430
I drive down to the court appearance.

4480
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:49,330
My friend's dad happened to be
in the DA's office in Providence.

4481
02:02:49,331 --> 02:02:50,440
I get out of the,

4482
02:02:50,441 --> 02:02:51,160
uh,

4483
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:52,270
I get out of the charges.

4484
02:02:52,770 --> 02:02:54,010
It was assault charges,

4485
02:02:54,340 --> 02:02:55,180
not assault charges.

4486
02:02:55,181 --> 02:02:55,780
Um,

4487
02:02:55,780 --> 02:02:56,613
disorderly conduct,

4488
02:02:57,100 --> 02:02:57,790
get in the car,

4489
02:02:57,790 --> 02:02:58,810
drive back to Boston,

4490
02:02:58,811 --> 02:02:59,111
which is,

4491
02:02:59,111 --> 02:02:59,420
you know,

4492
02:02:59,420 --> 02:03:02,410
good hour and 20 minutes driving north,

4493
02:03:02,830 --> 02:03:04,480
completely fall asleep.

4494
02:03:04,900 --> 02:03:05,950
I wake up and I'm,

4495
02:03:06,040 --> 02:03:07,750
I hit the guard rail twice,

4496
02:03:07,870 --> 02:03:08,830
spun out,

4497
02:03:09,010 --> 02:03:13,660
hit the back tire of a truck straight
and f like fish that ended up on the side

4498
02:03:13,661 --> 02:03:14,141
of the road.

4499
02:03:14,141 --> 02:03:18,610
Her car was demolished and
got it towed back to Boston.

4500
02:03:18,611 --> 02:03:19,330
It was like,

4501
02:03:19,330 --> 02:03:19,691
here,

4502
02:03:19,691 --> 02:03:20,524
ex-girlfriend,

4503
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:21,940
here's your wrecked car right

4504
02:03:21,950 --> 02:03:22,340
back.

4505
02:03:22,340 --> 02:03:23,540
Oh my God.

4506
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:24,433
Yeah.

4507
02:03:24,530 --> 02:03:26,030
Oh my God.

4508
02:03:26,510 --> 02:03:27,343
Did you fuck her?

4509
02:03:27,820 --> 02:03:28,653
Yeah.

4510
02:03:28,730 --> 02:03:29,540
After that.

4511
02:03:29,540 --> 02:03:29,781
Yeah,

4512
02:03:29,781 --> 02:03:30,261
we went,

4513
02:03:30,261 --> 02:03:30,401
we,

4514
02:03:30,401 --> 02:03:30,890
we had an,

4515
02:03:30,890 --> 02:03:32,030
we had a breakup kind of,

4516
02:03:32,031 --> 02:03:33,590
we had a long term,

4517
02:03:34,070 --> 02:03:36,500
really nice sexual relationship.

4518
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:37,400
Really,

4519
02:03:37,400 --> 02:03:38,030
really quick.

4520
02:03:38,030 --> 02:03:38,721
You reminiscing.

4521
02:03:38,721 --> 02:03:39,261
It was good.

4522
02:03:39,261 --> 02:03:40,970
You probably met her girl,

4523
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:41,750
Cindy.

4524
02:03:41,750 --> 02:03:42,583
Do you remember?

4525
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:44,113
Yes.

4526
02:03:45,530 --> 02:03:46,130
Yes.

4527
02:03:46,130 --> 02:03:47,030
I remember that one.

4528
02:03:47,150 --> 02:03:49,700
That was like a 89 right?

4529
02:03:49,701 --> 02:03:50,360
Yup.

4530
02:03:50,360 --> 02:03:51,680
My dated or in college.

4531
02:03:51,681 --> 02:03:53,780
So then I graduated 89
and we were broken up,

4532
02:03:53,781 --> 02:03:56,090
but it was like a couple more years of,

4533
02:03:56,120 --> 02:03:56,940
you know,

4534
02:03:56,940 --> 02:03:58,480
how can up dude,

4535
02:03:58,600 --> 02:03:59,433
dude,

4536
02:04:01,290 --> 02:04:03,070
there's nothing better than that.

4537
02:04:03,190 --> 02:04:05,800
It's kind of cool when you hook up
with someone that you used to bang.

4538
02:04:06,820 --> 02:04:08,710
That happened to me very few times,

4539
02:04:08,711 --> 02:04:13,711
but one time it was my high
school girlfriend and we
were both like 24 25 at the

4540
02:04:13,811 --> 02:04:14,470
time.

4541
02:04:14,470 --> 02:04:19,470
It was way better because like we did it
when we were like 1516 whatever it was.

4542
02:04:20,830 --> 02:04:23,560
And now all of a sudden
we're like 25 you know,

4543
02:04:23,580 --> 02:04:23,951
and it was,

4544
02:04:23,951 --> 02:04:24,551
it was interesting.

4545
02:04:24,551 --> 02:04:25,450
She was a woman now,

4546
02:04:25,510 --> 02:04:26,230
you know,

4547
02:04:26,230 --> 02:04:27,280
just like I was a man,

4548
02:04:27,281 --> 02:04:27,491
you know,

4549
02:04:27,491 --> 02:04:29,170
when we met we were like little kids.

4550
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:31,570
So it was very strange,

4551
02:04:31,660 --> 02:04:32,493
you know,

4552
02:04:32,540 --> 02:04:37,500
is a nice bond because like you've been
through something together that you

4553
02:04:37,501 --> 02:04:38,310
can't,

4554
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:42,570
you can't make that up with somebody
at that age when you had anything with

4555
02:04:42,571 --> 02:04:42,991
somebody.

4556
02:04:42,991 --> 02:04:44,340
It's still kind of comes up,

4557
02:04:44,610 --> 02:04:45,443
talk a little bit.

4558
02:04:45,450 --> 02:04:46,590
But she was brutal.

4559
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:47,101
So,

4560
02:04:47,101 --> 02:04:47,820
uh,

4561
02:04:47,820 --> 02:04:50,520
she was spending the weekend and uh,

4562
02:04:50,550 --> 02:04:53,040
I got out of it and I though
I had to get out of it.

4563
02:04:53,070 --> 02:04:53,341
I keep,

4564
02:04:53,341 --> 02:04:55,860
she was driving me crazy
and my friend called me up.

4565
02:04:56,700 --> 02:04:58,680
I answered the phone and
I just started going,

4566
02:04:58,740 --> 02:04:59,491
oh my God,

4567
02:04:59,491 --> 02:05:01,050
I can't believe I forgot.

4568
02:05:01,051 --> 02:05:02,370
Fuck Dude.

4569
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:03,090
No,

4570
02:05:03,090 --> 02:05:04,770
I know how important this is to look.

4571
02:05:04,771 --> 02:05:05,440
I'll just,

4572
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:05,660
I'll,

4573
02:05:05,660 --> 02:05:06,480
I'll come and get you.

4574
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:07,310
I'll come and get ya.

4575
02:05:07,310 --> 02:05:07,980
Alright.

4576
02:05:07,980 --> 02:05:10,530
And I just made up some crazy thing about,

4577
02:05:10,540 --> 02:05:15,420
I had to go with my friend to take him
somewhere and I just had to get away from

4578
02:05:15,421 --> 02:05:16,130
her.

4579
02:05:16,130 --> 02:05:17,040
She was torturing me.

4580
02:05:17,041 --> 02:05:17,940
I felt really bad,

4581
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:20,640
but I didn't feel bad enough
to not go through with it.

4582
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:22,430
I had to get rid of this claustrophobia.

4583
02:05:22,460 --> 02:05:23,221
You needed to do that.

4584
02:05:23,221 --> 02:05:24,090
She was brutal.

4585
02:05:24,180 --> 02:05:24,850
She was,

4586
02:05:24,850 --> 02:05:25,683
she was,

4587
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:27,300
I dunno what,

4588
02:05:27,690 --> 02:05:28,170
you know,

4589
02:05:28,170 --> 02:05:30,000
her deal was like as far as like,

4590
02:05:30,030 --> 02:05:30,863
um,

4591
02:05:30,870 --> 02:05:32,280
what kind of guys that she was dating,

4592
02:05:32,490 --> 02:05:33,323
but she was,

4593
02:05:33,930 --> 02:05:37,560
there was this thing that she was
doing where she would like try to get,

4594
02:05:37,561 --> 02:05:38,520
if you like this,

4595
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:39,420
she wanted that.

4596
02:05:39,450 --> 02:05:41,190
If you wanted that she wanted this.

4597
02:05:41,490 --> 02:05:43,470
If you liked the song
that was on the radio,

4598
02:05:43,530 --> 02:05:45,090
she wanted to change it to what she liked.

4599
02:05:45,200 --> 02:05:46,033
[inaudible] girl.

4600
02:05:46,140 --> 02:05:46,381
No,

4601
02:05:46,381 --> 02:05:48,120
she was Boston and it was,

4602
02:05:48,180 --> 02:05:48,640
it was just,

4603
02:05:48,640 --> 02:05:49,020
it was,

4604
02:05:49,020 --> 02:05:49,681
it was a weird,

4605
02:05:49,681 --> 02:05:50,310
she was pretty,

4606
02:05:50,310 --> 02:05:51,450
and then it was a weird,

4607
02:05:51,510 --> 02:05:52,410
like she,

4608
02:05:52,580 --> 02:05:52,980
you know,

4609
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:53,813
like

4610
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:55,590
thing was,

4611
02:05:55,590 --> 02:05:56,700
it was exhausting.

4612
02:05:56,940 --> 02:05:57,780
It wasn't fun.

4613
02:05:57,830 --> 02:05:58,200
Right.

4614
02:05:58,200 --> 02:06:00,960
It was exhausting and it got
to the point where I was like,

4615
02:06:00,961 --> 02:06:01,291
okay,

4616
02:06:01,291 --> 02:06:02,250
I got it.

4617
02:06:02,251 --> 02:06:03,200
It was just too,

4618
02:06:04,010 --> 02:06:06,990
she liked that 14 not that much.

4619
02:06:07,050 --> 02:06:07,620
No,

4620
02:06:07,620 --> 02:06:08,550
but other,

4621
02:06:08,690 --> 02:06:13,690
the relationship shifted as we got older
because I graduated high school first

4622
02:06:14,821 --> 02:06:16,260
and I was completely lost and,

4623
02:06:16,290 --> 02:06:16,710
uh,

4624
02:06:16,710 --> 02:06:18,870
it wasn't very successful and
I felt like I was a loser.

4625
02:06:18,870 --> 02:06:21,630
I was very insecure and she moved
to another part of the state.

4626
02:06:22,020 --> 02:06:22,621
And then,

4627
02:06:22,621 --> 02:06:22,981
you know,

4628
02:06:22,981 --> 02:06:24,720
I would go visit her and it was just,

4629
02:06:24,721 --> 02:06:25,380
it wasn't,

4630
02:06:25,380 --> 02:06:26,490
it wasn't really,

4631
02:06:26,550 --> 02:06:27,383
you know,

4632
02:06:27,390 --> 02:06:30,600
like it wasn't an even
relationship at the end.

4633
02:06:30,630 --> 02:06:33,180
I liked her more than she
liked me cause I was just like,

4634
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:34,650
I didn't know what the fuck was going on.

4635
02:06:34,651 --> 02:06:35,490
I was getting out of high school.

4636
02:06:35,491 --> 02:06:38,790
It was like very traumatic for me trying
to figure out what to do with my life,

4637
02:06:38,820 --> 02:06:39,390
you know,

4638
02:06:39,390 --> 02:06:41,580
because everything I
really was into it was,

4639
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:43,500
I was excited about had no future.

4640
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:44,160
It's like,

4641
02:06:44,160 --> 02:06:46,590
like how much future
is or in martial arts,

4642
02:06:46,591 --> 02:06:46,861
you know,

4643
02:06:46,861 --> 02:06:48,070
how much futures are in fighting.

4644
02:06:48,071 --> 02:06:51,960
Like I did and I didn't necessarily want
to be teaching people for the rest of

4645
02:06:51,961 --> 02:06:52,531
my life either.

4646
02:06:52,531 --> 02:06:54,510
So it was like really confused.

4647
02:06:54,930 --> 02:06:59,930
But then when we met when I was 25 I
was a man and I was secure and I wasn't

4648
02:06:59,941 --> 02:07:00,930
that way anymore,

4649
02:07:01,290 --> 02:07:01,800
you know?

4650
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:03,650
And I think she was used to the,

4651
02:07:03,660 --> 02:07:05,790
the last year or so of our relationship,

4652
02:07:05,791 --> 02:07:09,240
she sorta got what she wanted and
got pushed me around a little.

4653
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:11,010
Yeah,

4654
02:07:11,010 --> 02:07:11,521
she was,

4655
02:07:11,521 --> 02:07:12,060
yeah.

4656
02:07:12,060 --> 02:07:17,060
She was also like a single
child to a single mother and uh,

4657
02:07:17,250 --> 02:07:22,250
she had this weird thing where she
just wanted to kind of run things,

4658
02:07:22,591 --> 02:07:23,340
you know,

4659
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:26,100
I think I dunno or wanted to like,

4660
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:30,090
I dunno just be heard or money.

4661
02:07:30,150 --> 02:07:33,570
I mean that not even necessarily be heard
but be the one that gets to push the

4662
02:07:33,571 --> 02:07:34,140
button.

4663
02:07:34,140 --> 02:07:35,790
I'll see the one that gets can't

4664
02:07:36,030 --> 02:07:39,270
be with you because they don't
know how you feel about them.

4665
02:07:39,271 --> 02:07:42,750
So they constantly have to keep tension
in the line and you're going to keep

4666
02:07:42,751 --> 02:07:43,520
kind of

4667
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:45,350
poking you and testing you.

4668
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:46,753
What was so weird,

4669
02:07:46,760 --> 02:07:49,550
there was like an
inflexibility to her demands.

4670
02:07:49,551 --> 02:07:50,570
That's a good way of putting it.

4671
02:07:50,571 --> 02:07:50,930
Yeah.

4672
02:07:50,930 --> 02:07:53,990
It was like she wanted it this way
and this is what we need to do.

4673
02:07:54,350 --> 02:07:54,861
And it was like,

4674
02:07:54,861 --> 02:07:55,694
oh come on.

4675
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:59,240
Like you're not being very fun like
you can we just like compromise,

4676
02:07:59,241 --> 02:07:59,721
have fun.

4677
02:07:59,721 --> 02:08:00,500
Figure this out.

4678
02:08:00,500 --> 02:08:03,260
Like how about will play one of your
songs and we'll play one of my songs.

4679
02:08:03,490 --> 02:08:04,820
It's like I don't want
to listen to this shit.

4680
02:08:05,150 --> 02:08:05,983
Turn it off.

4681
02:08:06,060 --> 02:08:07,100
Like turn it off.

4682
02:08:07,130 --> 02:08:08,540
You're telling me to
turn it off in my car.

4683
02:08:08,541 --> 02:08:10,190
You're telling me to turn
the radio off in my car?

4684
02:08:10,760 --> 02:08:11,630
Not like,

4685
02:08:11,631 --> 02:08:11,960
you know,

4686
02:08:11,960 --> 02:08:15,650
it would be super awesome
if you put something on that
doesn't suck like nothing

4687
02:08:15,651 --> 02:08:16,310
funny.

4688
02:08:16,310 --> 02:08:17,110
You know what I mean?

4689
02:08:17,110 --> 02:08:17,240
Yeah.

4690
02:08:17,240 --> 02:08:17,691
There was nothing,

4691
02:08:17,691 --> 02:08:18,770
no silliness to it.

4692
02:08:19,220 --> 02:08:22,940
I just remember being in the car and her
telling me to change the station and it

4693
02:08:22,941 --> 02:08:23,361
was just like,

4694
02:08:23,361 --> 02:08:24,740
this is like so gross.

4695
02:08:25,160 --> 02:08:26,810
Like this is like a weird moment.

4696
02:08:26,811 --> 02:08:28,910
Like why do you even care?

4697
02:08:28,970 --> 02:08:32,840
Like I mean with if I'm in someone's
car and they start playing shitty music,

4698
02:08:33,740 --> 02:08:37,670
to me that's an opportunity to just
start laughing and make it funny or shit

4699
02:08:37,671 --> 02:08:38,504
music.

4700
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:42,680
I would never like be upset
if it's your fucking car.

4701
02:08:42,681 --> 02:08:42,890
I had

4702
02:08:42,890 --> 02:08:44,930
this girl who when I was in high school,

4703
02:08:44,931 --> 02:08:45,381
I used to,

4704
02:08:45,381 --> 02:08:48,620
I used to go to this school that was
like 20 minutes away and the only way to

4705
02:08:48,621 --> 02:08:51,830
get there was a giant
big yellow school bus.

4706
02:08:52,130 --> 02:08:53,840
And it was all Catholic school girls,

4707
02:08:54,260 --> 02:08:55,093
except for me,

4708
02:08:55,580 --> 02:09:00,020
I was the only male on the
bus every fucking day until
I finally saved up enough

4709
02:09:00,021 --> 02:09:01,190
for a car when I was a junior.

4710
02:09:01,700 --> 02:09:02,900
So first of all,

4711
02:09:02,901 --> 02:09:04,670
it's a masturbatory fantasy from heaven,

4712
02:09:05,030 --> 02:09:07,010
but it was also a living hell because I'm,

4713
02:09:07,011 --> 02:09:08,360
it's Zit face,

4714
02:09:08,361 --> 02:09:11,630
skinny little boy and all these girls are,

4715
02:09:11,631 --> 02:09:12,170
you know,

4716
02:09:12,170 --> 02:09:14,000
like they're not talking to me.

4717
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:16,160
And I'd get on the bus and just slink.

4718
02:09:16,430 --> 02:09:17,930
And so after like a year,

4719
02:09:17,931 --> 02:09:19,520
I started to talk to this one girl.

4720
02:09:19,521 --> 02:09:20,354
She was pretty,

4721
02:09:20,720 --> 02:09:21,830
and she was like,

4722
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:22,730
what I loved,

4723
02:09:22,730 --> 02:09:25,250
she was like olive skinned with black,

4724
02:09:25,310 --> 02:09:25,761
thick,

4725
02:09:25,761 --> 02:09:29,060
wavy hair and Brown eyes
and a little bit thick.

4726
02:09:29,150 --> 02:09:29,960
You know,

4727
02:09:29,960 --> 02:09:30,711
she wasn't skinny.

4728
02:09:30,711 --> 02:09:32,870
She had a rack and a bike a little.

4729
02:09:32,871 --> 02:09:33,710
Yeah.

4730
02:09:33,870 --> 02:09:37,250
So I start and it got to the point where
I would get on the bus and she'd save a

4731
02:09:37,251 --> 02:09:39,410
seat and I'd sit next
to her and it was like,

4732
02:09:39,411 --> 02:09:39,680
oh my,

4733
02:09:39,680 --> 02:09:40,011
and you know,

4734
02:09:40,011 --> 02:09:43,760
this is when you're jerking off the
second you walk in the door every day.

4735
02:09:44,210 --> 02:09:46,820
And so I'm thinking about her
and I never asked her out.

4736
02:09:46,821 --> 02:09:48,380
I never had the balls to ask her out.

4737
02:09:48,381 --> 02:09:50,900
So we flirt and she
wanted me to ask her out.

4738
02:09:50,901 --> 02:09:55,100
And then like we kind of like met up once
at a party and I made out with her and

4739
02:09:55,101 --> 02:09:55,611
it was a big,

4740
02:09:55,611 --> 02:09:57,740
it was like two years
of thinking about it.

4741
02:09:57,741 --> 02:10:02,390
And then like I went off to college and
we kind of kept in touch with back when

4742
02:10:02,391 --> 02:10:03,740
you wrote letters to people.

4743
02:10:04,190 --> 02:10:07,340
And so we wrote letters and
then I invited her up to,

4744
02:10:07,341 --> 02:10:07,700
uh,

4745
02:10:07,700 --> 02:10:08,151
to visit.

4746
02:10:08,151 --> 02:10:12,080
She was a year younger and she was gonna
stay in my dorm for the weekend and it

4747
02:10:12,081 --> 02:10:12,830
was like,

4748
02:10:12,830 --> 02:10:13,640
I mean,

4749
02:10:13,640 --> 02:10:15,820
just fucking seven Rpms.

4750
02:10:15,830 --> 02:10:18,890
I'm out of my shit about what
this weekend is going to be like.

4751
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:20,070
She comes down,

4752
02:10:20,070 --> 02:10:21,710
I pick her up at the Greyhound station,

4753
02:10:21,740 --> 02:10:23,780
bring it to my dorm room and uh,

4754
02:10:23,781 --> 02:10:24,171
and it's,

4755
02:10:24,171 --> 02:10:24,260
uh,

4756
02:10:24,260 --> 02:10:27,440
it's like a Friday night and me and
my boys are just drinking shots,

4757
02:10:27,460 --> 02:10:28,370
Tequila,

4758
02:10:28,820 --> 02:10:29,840
Budweiser cans,

4759
02:10:29,841 --> 02:10:31,310
eight guys packed in a room,

4760
02:10:31,311 --> 02:10:36,311
there's cockroaches were yelling shit
and she's just rolling her eyes and going

4761
02:10:36,531 --> 02:10:36,860
like,

4762
02:10:36,860 --> 02:10:37,461
oh my God,

4763
02:10:37,461 --> 02:10:38,630
you guys are so immature.

4764
02:10:38,840 --> 02:10:41,570
And like I saw this girl off the bus,

4765
02:10:41,720 --> 02:10:45,050
like for the first time
off the bus in a room,

4766
02:10:45,051 --> 02:10:48,470
in a dorm room at a giant
university on a Friday night.

4767
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:49,520
And it was like,

4768
02:10:49,700 --> 02:10:54,140
I don't know who this is and I do not
want to spend time with this person and

4769
02:10:54,141 --> 02:10:56,570
she's staying with me
for the entire weekend.

4770
02:10:56,600 --> 02:10:59,240
So you felt like that or she
felt like that's how I felt.

4771
02:10:59,241 --> 02:10:59,481
I mean,

4772
02:10:59,481 --> 02:11:00,650
I think that she was,

4773
02:11:00,830 --> 02:11:05,830
she was probably really nervous and
overwhelmed about coming up to Boston

4774
02:11:06,230 --> 02:11:07,730
University and staying with me.

4775
02:11:08,040 --> 02:11:13,040
And I know we fooled around and then she
got upset while we were fooling around,

4776
02:11:16,250 --> 02:11:17,300
but was just,

4777
02:11:17,301 --> 02:11:18,350
she was freaking out.

4778
02:11:18,351 --> 02:11:19,280
It was too much.

4779
02:11:19,310 --> 02:11:20,360
It was too much.

4780
02:11:20,600 --> 02:11:21,800
Just fooling around,

4781
02:11:21,801 --> 02:11:23,030
going to the next level.

4782
02:11:23,031 --> 02:11:24,620
And then I just fooling
around with too much.

4783
02:11:24,621 --> 02:11:28,790
I think she was probably
a virgin if I was 19.

4784
02:11:28,791 --> 02:11:30,110
She was probably 17 or 18.

4785
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:31,070
Wow.

4786
02:11:31,070 --> 02:11:33,610
So then I brought it back to grey
hound the next to I was like,

4787
02:11:33,611 --> 02:11:33,801
yeah,

4788
02:11:33,801 --> 02:11:34,634
you gotta

4789
02:11:36,430 --> 02:11:37,001
I had a,

4790
02:11:37,001 --> 02:11:40,070
another girl that used to tell him
what to do about and this was uh,

4791
02:11:40,180 --> 02:11:41,140
she was older than me.

4792
02:11:41,200 --> 02:11:42,730
She was 25 when I was 21.

4793
02:11:43,540 --> 02:11:44,290
And uh,

4794
02:11:44,290 --> 02:11:44,660
we were,

4795
02:11:44,660 --> 02:11:45,850
we were in a car accident together.

4796
02:11:46,150 --> 02:11:47,410
Some a old man,

4797
02:11:47,560 --> 02:11:51,770
it's fucking t boned us
cause smashed into us.

4798
02:11:51,771 --> 02:11:53,650
So I was taking a left
on your side or her side.

4799
02:11:53,651 --> 02:11:54,310
Her side.

4800
02:11:54,310 --> 02:11:54,770
Nice.

4801
02:11:54,770 --> 02:11:55,270
Um,

4802
02:11:55,270 --> 02:11:57,100
it don't think it hit the door though.

4803
02:11:57,130 --> 02:11:59,320
I think it hit the front of the car.

4804
02:11:59,770 --> 02:12:01,270
I don't remember cause
I know she wasn't hurt.

4805
02:12:01,510 --> 02:12:02,343
But anyway,

4806
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:03,610
we got out of the car.

4807
02:12:03,910 --> 02:12:04,450
Um,

4808
02:12:04,450 --> 02:12:05,440
and uh,

4809
02:12:05,560 --> 02:12:06,393
I uh,

4810
02:12:06,700 --> 02:12:07,060
I,

4811
02:12:07,060 --> 02:12:07,481
you know,

4812
02:12:07,481 --> 02:12:08,890
go make sure that she's okay.

4813
02:12:08,891 --> 02:12:09,461
And then,

4814
02:12:09,461 --> 02:12:10,294
um,

4815
02:12:10,360 --> 02:12:14,530
I got like a box of shit that I had
in the car because the car was fucked.

4816
02:12:14,860 --> 02:12:15,693
It had to get towed.

4817
02:12:16,180 --> 02:12:20,800
And she made me throw out my Whitesnake
cassette because I had brought my

4818
02:12:20,801 --> 02:12:22,420
Whitesnake cassette from the car.

4819
02:12:22,420 --> 02:12:23,560
I like picked my stuff,

4820
02:12:23,561 --> 02:12:24,490
but I had in the car,

4821
02:12:24,850 --> 02:12:27,430
I got it back home and she
looked at it and she goes,

4822
02:12:27,610 --> 02:12:28,660
what the fuck is this?

4823
02:12:29,170 --> 02:12:29,741
And I go,

4824
02:12:29,741 --> 02:12:30,920
that's my Whitesnake cassette.

4825
02:12:31,050 --> 02:12:31,883
She goes,

4826
02:12:32,020 --> 02:12:32,560
she goes,

4827
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:33,800
you actually shoot.

4828
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:34,421
She goes,

4829
02:12:34,421 --> 02:12:35,590
you saved that from the car?

4830
02:12:35,650 --> 02:12:35,921
I go,

4831
02:12:35,921 --> 02:12:36,071
yeah.

4832
02:12:36,071 --> 02:12:36,341
She goes,

4833
02:12:36,341 --> 02:12:37,174
throw it out.

4834
02:12:37,510 --> 02:12:37,871
And I go,

4835
02:12:37,871 --> 02:12:38,704
why?

4836
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:39,161
And she goes,

4837
02:12:39,161 --> 02:12:40,390
cause it's shit.

4838
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:41,590
Just throw it out.

4839
02:12:42,130 --> 02:12:42,371
It's like,

4840
02:12:42,371 --> 02:12:42,821
all right.

4841
02:12:42,821 --> 02:12:44,320
So I threw it out and I stop.

4842
02:12:44,340 --> 02:12:45,820
I think about that to this day.

4843
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:46,301
I'm like,

4844
02:12:46,301 --> 02:12:47,650
how ridiculous is that?

4845
02:12:48,010 --> 02:12:49,300
Like she to her,

4846
02:12:49,330 --> 02:12:50,730
it's like I,

4847
02:12:50,770 --> 02:12:54,370
she couldn't have a boyfriend
that was listening to a,

4848
02:12:55,110 --> 02:12:55,561
I got to say,

4849
02:12:55,561 --> 02:12:55,801
Joe,

4850
02:12:55,801 --> 02:12:57,150
this is a lot of shit.

4851
02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:00,570
I agree with you on and I'll
support you on almost anything.

4852
02:13:01,350 --> 02:13:02,100
She made the right time.

4853
02:13:02,100 --> 02:13:02,933
Oh,

4854
02:13:04,530 --> 02:13:05,363
here we go.

4855
02:13:05,770 --> 02:13:06,900
Here we go.

4856
02:13:10,620 --> 02:13:13,710
That's one of those bands that made the
music video before they wrote the song

4857
02:13:14,910 --> 02:13:15,743
with Tawny.

4858
02:13:15,990 --> 02:13:20,990
Take that clawing around the Jaguar and
dancing and it's the most ridiculous.

4859
02:13:22,910 --> 02:13:23,780
The dude,

4860
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:24,591
what was his name?

4861
02:13:24,591 --> 02:13:25,910
That Michael Bolton looking dude,

4862
02:13:26,590 --> 02:13:26,981
God,

4863
02:13:26,981 --> 02:13:27,281
I hope,

4864
02:13:27,281 --> 02:13:29,160
I don't know from Whitesnake.

4865
02:13:29,200 --> 02:13:30,220
What does it have to call name?

4866
02:13:30,310 --> 02:13:32,020
I just remember that's
music videos were like,

4867
02:13:32,020 --> 02:13:33,670
you enjoy me,

4868
02:13:33,671 --> 02:13:34,860
some white snake music.

4869
02:13:34,870 --> 02:13:36,630
I don't give a fuck what anybody says.

4870
02:13:36,670 --> 02:13:41,260
Put a CD on or like an MP three of
Whitesnake listen to if I had to.

4871
02:13:42,340 --> 02:13:42,671
I mean,

4872
02:13:42,671 --> 02:13:43,570
I don't think I have it on.

4873
02:13:43,630 --> 02:13:44,250
Let me check.

4874
02:13:44,250 --> 02:13:44,440
No,

4875
02:13:44,440 --> 02:13:44,720
I have no,

4876
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:46,150
I don't have it on this computer.

4877
02:13:46,300 --> 02:13:46,540
Well,

4878
02:13:46,540 --> 02:13:46,850
look,

4879
02:13:46,850 --> 02:13:47,040
I'd,

4880
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:49,910
if I had it listen to
journey sometimes I'm sue.

4881
02:13:49,940 --> 02:13:52,870
I forgot Whitesnake on this fucking
not bon Jovi then I know that.

4882
02:13:52,871 --> 02:13:56,110
I know that you went to see Bon
Jovi live once while I worked there.

4883
02:13:56,600 --> 02:13:56,710
Yeah,

4884
02:13:56,710 --> 02:13:57,101
there was one.

4885
02:13:57,101 --> 02:13:58,360
I was working at great woods.

4886
02:13:58,800 --> 02:13:59,170
Um,

4887
02:13:59,170 --> 02:14:00,070
I didn't know you then.

4888
02:14:00,450 --> 02:14:00,910
Um,

4889
02:14:00,910 --> 02:14:01,960
I was a little younger.

4890
02:14:02,180 --> 02:14:03,880
I remember you telling me about it.

4891
02:14:03,881 --> 02:14:05,020
You talked about the,

4892
02:14:05,021 --> 02:14:07,000
the first moment he walked
on stage and it was,

4893
02:14:08,670 --> 02:14:10,380
and it was like an
explosion and you were like,

4894
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:10,810
you were like,

4895
02:14:10,810 --> 02:14:12,460
it was the coolest fucking moment.

4896
02:14:12,461 --> 02:14:12,821
And I was like,

4897
02:14:12,821 --> 02:14:13,654
I would say that

4898
02:14:13,740 --> 02:14:14,600
it was pretty wild.

4899
02:14:14,601 --> 02:14:16,910
That was when they were at
the height of their start.

4900
02:14:16,940 --> 02:14:17,330
Yeah.

4901
02:14:17,330 --> 02:14:20,150
It was at the Great Woods
Center in Mansfield,

4902
02:14:20,151 --> 02:14:21,050
Massachusetts.

4903
02:14:21,350 --> 02:14:22,183
And uh,

4904
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:23,500
I think when he did,

4905
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:27,780
I was like entering into the facility
when he got on stage and they shot

4906
02:14:33,850 --> 02:14:36,260
and it's deafening.

4907
02:14:36,380 --> 02:14:36,831
I mean,

4908
02:14:36,831 --> 02:14:37,051
the,

4909
02:14:37,051 --> 02:14:37,870
the cheers.

4910
02:14:37,870 --> 02:14:39,740
How many people were
excited about that song?

4911
02:14:40,110 --> 02:14:43,730
This is not nothing that a comic
could never do that tops that.

4912
02:14:43,750 --> 02:14:44,270
No.

4913
02:14:44,270 --> 02:14:49,250
The thing that when a rock band has a
song that you already know the song and

4914
02:14:49,251 --> 02:14:50,330
you want to hear it,

4915
02:14:50,570 --> 02:14:53,030
that is a completely different feeling.

4916
02:14:53,330 --> 02:14:54,170
Then like,

4917
02:14:54,230 --> 02:14:54,411
well,

4918
02:14:54,411 --> 02:14:55,730
we get art,

4919
02:14:55,731 --> 02:14:56,840
we're disposable.

4920
02:14:56,870 --> 02:14:58,520
Our jokes are disposable.

4921
02:14:58,521 --> 02:15:00,890
They're only good for a
couple of times maybe.

4922
02:15:01,100 --> 02:15:02,780
And then we don't even
want to hear him anymore.

4923
02:15:03,080 --> 02:15:03,830
Like you don't want it.

4924
02:15:03,830 --> 02:15:03,970
Well,

4925
02:15:03,970 --> 02:15:05,110
you don't want to hear guys a,

4926
02:15:05,130 --> 02:15:06,110
I seen his act,

4927
02:15:06,320 --> 02:15:06,561
you know,

4928
02:15:06,561 --> 02:15:07,940
you don't want new,

4929
02:15:07,970 --> 02:15:08,780
always new,

4930
02:15:08,780 --> 02:15:09,613
always new.

4931
02:15:09,620 --> 02:15:12,080
But like if you go to see
the stones and you're like,

4932
02:15:12,081 --> 02:15:12,681
what are they singing?

4933
02:15:12,681 --> 02:15:13,341
What does this song,

4934
02:15:13,341 --> 02:15:14,900
I've never heard this song is this new.

4935
02:15:15,770 --> 02:15:16,460
You know,

4936
02:15:16,460 --> 02:15:17,780
you want to hear the old shit.

4937
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:18,321
You know,

4938
02:15:18,321 --> 02:15:20,480
you want to hear Jack
flat jumping Jack Flash.

4939
02:15:20,690 --> 02:15:21,500
You want to hear,

4940
02:15:21,500 --> 02:15:22,333
you know,

4941
02:15:22,830 --> 02:15:23,770
you mind if they collaborate,

4942
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:25,660
another band saw you'd rather go

4943
02:15:27,240 --> 02:15:27,930
play a new one.

4944
02:15:27,930 --> 02:15:28,770
That's a good point.

4945
02:15:29,130 --> 02:15:29,371
Yeah.

4946
02:15:29,371 --> 02:15:31,420
You want to hear them cover
song that you already know.

4947
02:15:31,470 --> 02:15:32,071
It's familiar.

4948
02:15:32,071 --> 02:15:36,260
You've already had an emotional experience
with that song and now all they gotta

4949
02:15:36,280 --> 02:15:40,210
do is fucking push the button and that
emotion just opens right up again where

4950
02:15:40,211 --> 02:15:41,250
it's supposed to stand up.

4951
02:15:41,430 --> 02:15:42,750
It's completely cerebral.

4952
02:15:43,190 --> 02:15:44,023
Yeah.

4953
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:44,691
Yeah.

4954
02:15:44,691 --> 02:15:47,450
And the music when you're high,

4955
02:15:48,140 --> 02:15:51,260
there's nothing like a great
song when you got just,

4956
02:15:51,290 --> 02:15:52,760
just enough of a buzz,

4957
02:15:52,970 --> 02:15:54,530
not enough that you freaking out,

4958
02:15:55,960 --> 02:15:56,420
you know,

4959
02:15:56,420 --> 02:16:00,260
paranoid and feeling the chest feeling
weird things inside of your body,

4960
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:02,360
but just enough so that you just like,

4961
02:16:02,361 --> 02:16:03,740
just catch a little wave,

4962
02:16:04,100 --> 02:16:08,900
just catch a little wave and get lost in
a song that comes in over your headset.

4963
02:16:09,940 --> 02:16:10,021
Well,

4964
02:16:10,021 --> 02:16:10,920
the headset is a key.

4965
02:16:10,921 --> 02:16:11,610
If you're,

4966
02:16:11,610 --> 02:16:12,361
if you're high,

4967
02:16:12,361 --> 02:16:14,970
the right amount and you got on a
headset and you're listening to,

4968
02:16:14,971 --> 02:16:19,971
like when the music's over by the doors
for 11 minutes and you go into a trance

4969
02:16:20,371 --> 02:16:24,480
and you start to understand
what each instrument is doing,

4970
02:16:24,540 --> 02:16:25,770
or Jimi Hendrix,

4971
02:16:26,190 --> 02:16:27,000
it's like,

4972
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:27,331
yeah.

4973
02:16:27,331 --> 02:16:30,160
How do you compare that to any
experience could have in comedy.

4974
02:16:30,370 --> 02:16:30,641
Yeah.

4975
02:16:30,641 --> 02:16:31,210
You can't,

4976
02:16:31,210 --> 02:16:32,043
we suck.

4977
02:16:32,290 --> 02:16:33,400
We're pieces of shit.

4978
02:16:33,460 --> 02:16:35,020
We're just not as good now.

4979
02:16:35,021 --> 02:16:35,750
We're bad.

4980
02:16:35,750 --> 02:16:36,583
Shatter.

4981
02:16:42,140 --> 02:16:43,040
Oh Wow.

4982
02:16:43,190 --> 02:16:45,620
And then when I was a comedian many,

4983
02:16:45,621 --> 02:16:46,790
many years in the future,

4984
02:16:46,791 --> 02:16:49,730
I opened up for Bon Jovi on a van.

4985
02:16:49,790 --> 02:16:50,450
Yeah.

4986
02:16:50,450 --> 02:16:53,120
Vh One theater in the round thing.

4987
02:16:53,180 --> 02:16:54,680
It was a in Brooklyn.

4988
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:55,793
Yeah.

4989
02:16:56,620 --> 02:16:57,140
Goats.

4990
02:16:57,140 --> 02:16:57,330
Yeah.

4991
02:16:57,330 --> 02:16:57,871
It was,

4992
02:16:57,871 --> 02:16:58,350
um,

4993
02:16:58,350 --> 02:17:01,230
it was this thing where it was a disaster.

4994
02:17:01,890 --> 02:17:04,290
I had a deal with MTV and a,

4995
02:17:04,300 --> 02:17:05,490
I was supposed to do some,

4996
02:17:05,491 --> 02:17:06,210
um,

4997
02:17:06,210 --> 02:17:07,770
it's going to be some game show thing.

4998
02:17:07,860 --> 02:17:08,611
It's a long,

4999
02:17:08,611 --> 02:17:08,941
long,

5000
02:17:08,941 --> 02:17:09,361
long,

5001
02:17:09,361 --> 02:17:09,601
long,

5002
02:17:09,601 --> 02:17:10,434
long time ago.

5003
02:17:10,650 --> 02:17:12,780
It didn't pan out and uh,

5004
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:15,600
I think I had like a short term
deal with them or something.

5005
02:17:15,601 --> 02:17:16,530
I don't remember what it was.

5006
02:17:16,830 --> 02:17:17,191
But uh,

5007
02:17:17,191 --> 02:17:20,790
I did a couple of things for them and
one of the things that I did was open up

5008
02:17:20,791 --> 02:17:25,791
for a Bon Jovi for VH one and it was me
and a theater in the round and that was

5009
02:17:26,251 --> 02:17:26,761
really weird.

5010
02:17:26,761 --> 02:17:27,700
I never experienced

5011
02:17:27,790 --> 02:17:28,690
were you warming up?

5012
02:17:28,691 --> 02:17:30,820
The crowd are part of
the televised special?

5013
02:17:30,850 --> 02:17:31,121
Oh No,

5014
02:17:31,121 --> 02:17:31,241
no,

5015
02:17:31,241 --> 02:17:31,430
no.

5016
02:17:31,430 --> 02:17:32,420
I was warming up the crowd.

5017
02:17:32,421 --> 02:17:33,500
I wasn't part of it at all.

5018
02:17:33,590 --> 02:17:35,500
The only part that I played is uh,

5019
02:17:35,570 --> 02:17:40,570
trying to get people that were attractive
to sit close to the stage they like

5020
02:17:40,821 --> 02:17:41,151
won it.

5021
02:17:41,151 --> 02:17:41,661
It was interesting.

5022
02:17:41,661 --> 02:17:43,010
They were trying to engineer the crowd.

5023
02:17:43,340 --> 02:17:47,840
They were like asking me as a warmup
comedian to not just warm up the crowd,

5024
02:17:47,841 --> 02:17:51,300
but to take some of the people that
were pretty and try to get them.

5025
02:17:51,420 --> 02:17:51,511
Oh,

5026
02:17:51,511 --> 02:17:53,130
so you weren't doing straight stand up,

5027
02:17:53,131 --> 02:17:55,380
it was like entertain them and do this.

5028
02:17:55,381 --> 02:17:55,920
Yes.

5029
02:17:55,920 --> 02:17:56,753
It was both.

5030
02:17:56,790 --> 02:17:57,300
Yeah.

5031
02:17:57,300 --> 02:17:57,990
Wow.

5032
02:17:57,990 --> 02:17:59,040
In the round

5033
02:17:59,170 --> 02:18:00,000
round.

5034
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:00,833
Yeah.

5035
02:18:02,010 --> 02:18:02,641
Not only that,

5036
02:18:02,641 --> 02:18:04,710
they didn't want anything to do with me,

5037
02:18:04,980 --> 02:18:05,341
you know,

5038
02:18:05,341 --> 02:18:05,971
why do they want,

5039
02:18:05,971 --> 02:18:07,800
they don't want a comedian.

5040
02:18:07,830 --> 02:18:09,030
They're not here for comedy.

5041
02:18:09,031 --> 02:18:11,730
They're the drool over
Bon Jovi in his band.

5042
02:18:11,820 --> 02:18:13,140
And then to make it worse,

5043
02:18:13,260 --> 02:18:14,520
it's not even a real show.

5044
02:18:14,521 --> 02:18:15,450
It's a TV taping.

5045
02:18:15,451 --> 02:18:17,190
So this camera's blocking their view.

5046
02:18:17,310 --> 02:18:20,110
They're lit up so they totally self aware.

5047
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:20,980
Yeah.

5048
02:18:20,980 --> 02:18:21,813
Yeah.

5049
02:18:21,820 --> 02:18:22,571
And uh,

5050
02:18:22,571 --> 02:18:23,200
they,

5051
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:23,800
you know,

5052
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:24,760
they still rocked it though.

5053
02:18:25,060 --> 02:18:25,420
Yeah.

5054
02:18:25,420 --> 02:18:25,970
The girls,

5055
02:18:25,970 --> 02:18:26,830
it was mostly women.

5056
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:27,581
It was a,

5057
02:18:27,581 --> 02:18:27,940
um,

5058
02:18:27,940 --> 02:18:30,280
I think it was called an
intimate evening with Bon Jovi.

5059
02:18:30,281 --> 02:18:30,941
I forget what it was called.

5060
02:18:30,941 --> 02:18:31,700
Is it unplugged?

5061
02:18:31,700 --> 02:18:32,533
It part of unplugged?

5062
02:18:32,950 --> 02:18:34,120
I don't believe it was unplugged.

5063
02:18:34,121 --> 02:18:34,331
I mean,

5064
02:18:34,331 --> 02:18:37,120
they had like a full
arsenal of weapons up there.

5065
02:18:37,270 --> 02:18:38,680
They had pretty much everything.

5066
02:18:38,750 --> 02:18:41,350
It was just a small intimate show.

5067
02:18:41,500 --> 02:18:44,050
So for them it was like the
most awesome thing ever.

5068
02:18:44,140 --> 02:18:45,940
But before they could get to it,

5069
02:18:45,941 --> 02:18:50,200
they had to endure some shitty comedian
trying to get the pretty ones to sit in

5070
02:18:50,201 --> 02:18:51,100
the front of the stage.

5071
02:18:51,101 --> 02:18:51,934
Like,

5072
02:18:52,580 --> 02:18:52,761
dude,

5073
02:18:52,761 --> 02:18:52,941
I,

5074
02:18:52,941 --> 02:18:57,830
I opened for a grand funk railroad
at a theater in the round.

5075
02:18:57,831 --> 02:18:58,970
And what was the one in Queens?

5076
02:18:58,971 --> 02:18:59,540
The uh,

5077
02:18:59,540 --> 02:18:59,930
wow.

5078
02:18:59,930 --> 02:19:02,250
Westbury music 10 yeah,

5079
02:19:02,350 --> 02:19:02,530
yeah.

5080
02:19:02,530 --> 02:19:03,363
Just playing music fair.

5081
02:19:03,460 --> 02:19:05,060
And that long island is long island.

5082
02:19:05,061 --> 02:19:05,181
Yeah.

5083
02:19:05,181 --> 02:19:06,250
I can see edge edge of Queens,

5084
02:19:06,270 --> 02:19:06,950
Long Island.

5085
02:19:06,950 --> 02:19:09,410
So they send me out there and it's
like one of those gigs where it's like,

5086
02:19:09,411 --> 02:19:14,270
I'm making fucking 250 bucks and
I get out there and there and I,

5087
02:19:14,300 --> 02:19:15,740
and I didn't know his
theater in the round.

5088
02:19:16,060 --> 02:19:16,910
So I'm backstage,

5089
02:19:16,911 --> 02:19:17,270
I'm my,

5090
02:19:17,270 --> 02:19:17,841
where's the stage?

5091
02:19:17,841 --> 02:19:18,171
And they're like,

5092
02:19:18,171 --> 02:19:18,321
well,

5093
02:19:18,321 --> 02:19:19,520
there's no really backstage.

5094
02:19:19,521 --> 02:19:22,120
It's like you have to
descend into it like,

5095
02:19:22,121 --> 02:19:22,420
uh,

5096
02:19:22,420 --> 02:19:22,910
like the,

5097
02:19:22,910 --> 02:19:25,340
like a Christian going into
the pit with the lions.

5098
02:19:25,341 --> 02:19:25,760
You just,

5099
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:28,640
you run down the aisle onto the stage.

5100
02:19:29,060 --> 02:19:29,990
And so they go,

5101
02:19:29,991 --> 02:19:31,010
ladies and gentlemen,

5102
02:19:31,011 --> 02:19:33,110
are you ready for grand funk railroad?

5103
02:19:33,290 --> 02:19:34,340
And it's everybody's,

5104
02:19:34,341 --> 02:19:34,770
you know,

5105
02:19:34,770 --> 02:19:35,420
forties,

5106
02:19:35,420 --> 02:19:40,280
50 years old and they're lame denim
jacket wearing fucking losers.

5107
02:19:40,460 --> 02:19:42,530
And they start screaming and they go,

5108
02:19:42,710 --> 02:19:43,700
but first,

5109
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,280
give it up for your opening act.

5110
02:19:46,670 --> 02:19:48,080
Oh,

5111
02:19:48,380 --> 02:19:49,400
Greg fit.

5112
02:19:51,090 --> 02:19:56,090
So I'm running to the stage while 3000
people are booing at me and I get down

5113
02:19:56,811 --> 02:20:00,800
there and I pick up the mic and I
start trying to tell jokes and they,

5114
02:20:00,870 --> 02:20:03,740
if they're enjoying how
funny it is to Boomi.

5115
02:20:04,490 --> 02:20:05,870
And so finally,

5116
02:20:05,900 --> 02:20:07,190
just out of pure,

5117
02:20:07,250 --> 02:20:07,791
you know,

5118
02:20:07,791 --> 02:20:08,450
uh,

5119
02:20:08,450 --> 02:20:10,880
just people started respected
that I was actually trying.

5120
02:20:11,030 --> 02:20:14,420
So half the crowd stopped booing and then
more him stop doing it and they start

5121
02:20:14,421 --> 02:20:15,290
actually listening.

5122
02:20:15,530 --> 02:20:17,660
And I was almost doing a show,

5123
02:20:17,780 --> 02:20:20,990
but there was that the stage turns,

5124
02:20:21,350 --> 02:20:26,000
it actually turns like once every
three minutes it makes a full lap.

5125
02:20:26,300 --> 02:20:28,340
So you're like a rotisserie chicken.

5126
02:20:28,580 --> 02:20:32,240
And so people would hackle me and then I
couldn't even see where they work cause

5127
02:20:32,241 --> 02:20:32,840
I was turning.

5128
02:20:32,840 --> 02:20:34,310
And so they were like somewhere else.

5129
02:20:34,610 --> 02:20:37,280
And it just went on and
on and then I did my time.

5130
02:20:37,281 --> 02:20:37,581
I was like,

5131
02:20:37,581 --> 02:20:38,780
I'm getting fucking paid.

5132
02:20:38,930 --> 02:20:41,000
I'm doing my 12 minutes
or whatever it was.

5133
02:20:41,330 --> 02:20:44,900
And then I ran off stage and I ran up
the aisle and people were like high five

5134
02:20:44,901 --> 02:20:45,051
me,

5135
02:20:45,051 --> 02:20:48,380
and then they introduce them and it was
like a standing ovation for fucking 10

5136
02:20:48,381 --> 02:20:48,621
minutes.

5137
02:20:48,621 --> 02:20:49,454
They went crazy.

5138
02:20:49,460 --> 02:20:49,610
Oh.

5139
02:20:49,610 --> 02:20:50,480
One of the things I said was,

5140
02:20:50,570 --> 02:20:50,931
come on,

5141
02:20:50,931 --> 02:20:52,880
you've waited 20 years to see these guys.

5142
02:20:52,881 --> 02:20:54,440
You can wait another 20 minutes.

5143
02:20:54,590 --> 02:20:56,900
You'll get your mother's
station wagon back by middle.

5144
02:20:58,410 --> 02:20:59,243
Nice.

5145
02:21:01,660 --> 02:21:03,100
Good funk railroad.

5146
02:21:03,570 --> 02:21:06,850
I did theater in the round a
couple of years back in Phoenix.

5147
02:21:07,240 --> 02:21:07,930
This weird.

5148
02:21:07,930 --> 02:21:08,081
Oh,

5149
02:21:08,081 --> 02:21:08,801
we're interested in blue.

5150
02:21:08,801 --> 02:21:09,730
We just did a special,

5151
02:21:09,731 --> 02:21:11,890
I think there and then the
celebrity theater as a,

5152
02:21:12,230 --> 02:21:12,880
yeah,

5153
02:21:12,880 --> 02:21:13,713
a special.

5154
02:21:13,720 --> 02:21:14,340
Really?

5155
02:21:14,340 --> 02:21:14,560
Yeah.

5156
02:21:14,560 --> 02:21:15,970
It's like 2100 seats.

5157
02:21:16,070 --> 02:21:16,960
It's a good move.

5158
02:21:17,020 --> 02:21:17,680
Phoenix is,

5159
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:18,513
they're good people.

5160
02:21:18,550 --> 02:21:18,971
They're fun.

5161
02:21:18,971 --> 02:21:19,870
People did.

5162
02:21:20,010 --> 02:21:22,150
Let's turn also like a slowly turned in.

5163
02:21:22,151 --> 02:21:22,984
A single might have.

5164
02:21:23,010 --> 02:21:23,620
I think that plays,

5165
02:21:23,620 --> 02:21:24,940
Carlin did a special there.

5166
02:21:24,941 --> 02:21:26,110
That's why Louie wanted to do it.

5167
02:21:26,111 --> 02:21:29,860
They're cooked it a lot of giant
like theater in the rounds.

5168
02:21:29,890 --> 02:21:31,270
He did like a lot of his,

5169
02:21:31,271 --> 02:21:31,690
uh,

5170
02:21:31,690 --> 02:21:32,920
his specials I think.

5171
02:21:33,370 --> 02:21:35,620
Did he do with the one
in Madison Square Garden?

5172
02:21:35,621 --> 02:21:36,530
Was it the theater in the round?

5173
02:21:36,610 --> 02:21:37,150
Did you,

5174
02:21:37,150 --> 02:21:38,620
did you like doing it in the round?

5175
02:21:38,890 --> 02:21:39,723
No,

5176
02:21:40,090 --> 02:21:40,331
no.

5177
02:21:40,331 --> 02:21:41,080
It's distracting.

5178
02:21:41,080 --> 02:21:41,320
Yeah.

5179
02:21:41,320 --> 02:21:44,290
I don't want anybody to have to look at
the back of my head while I'm telling a

5180
02:21:44,291 --> 02:21:45,550
joke that you want to see my face,

5181
02:21:45,570 --> 02:21:45,940
right.

5182
02:21:45,940 --> 02:21:47,170
Like that's a shitty seat.

5183
02:21:47,410 --> 02:21:48,730
So there's like monitors,

5184
02:21:49,360 --> 02:21:52,120
but why do you want to watch a monitor
when the guy was right there and you find

5185
02:21:52,121 --> 02:21:53,920
yourself twirling with the monitors here?

5186
02:21:54,250 --> 02:21:55,400
I don't even remember
what it was monitoring.

5187
02:21:55,420 --> 02:21:55,661
I was like,

5188
02:21:55,661 --> 02:21:56,420
it was

5189
02:21:56,420 --> 02:21:58,550
that Gig that we did together in,

5190
02:21:58,580 --> 02:22:00,560
it was either Seattle
or San Francisco was,

5191
02:22:00,561 --> 02:22:00,771
no,

5192
02:22:00,771 --> 02:22:02,870
Seattle was almost in the round.

5193
02:22:02,871 --> 02:22:05,030
Remember you came out and it was about,

5194
02:22:05,340 --> 02:22:05,461
oh,

5195
02:22:05,461 --> 02:22:06,310
that was San Francisco.

5196
02:22:06,311 --> 02:22:08,920
That was the first night that was
pretty close to theater in the round.

5197
02:22:09,340 --> 02:22:13,450
It was like theater and the half around
when I was like at least three quarters.

5198
02:22:13,810 --> 02:22:14,643
Half a moon.

5199
02:22:14,890 --> 02:22:15,401
Yeah.

5200
02:22:15,401 --> 02:22:15,791
That was,

5201
02:22:15,791 --> 02:22:16,510
um,

5202
02:22:16,510 --> 02:22:16,811
yeah,

5203
02:22:16,811 --> 02:22:17,860
that was an interesting spot.

5204
02:22:17,861 --> 02:22:19,360
That was the masonic lodge.

5205
02:22:19,750 --> 02:22:20,650
Yeah.

5206
02:22:20,651 --> 02:22:22,300
That was a masonic exterior.

5207
02:22:22,340 --> 02:22:25,350
The fuck it is people who accused me of
being an Illuminati cause I was doing a

5208
02:22:25,351 --> 02:22:26,610
show at the masonic lodge.

5209
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:31,320
You fucking please all you knuckleheads
online that think I'm a satanist.

5210
02:22:31,350 --> 02:22:32,520
Please stop.

5211
02:22:33,060 --> 02:22:34,170
If you're serious,

5212
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:34,981
you silly.

5213
02:22:34,981 --> 02:22:37,230
Fuck if you see like it's a serious

5214
02:22:37,570 --> 02:22:40,360
to question because now that
you have this show on Scifi,

5215
02:22:40,361 --> 02:22:41,194
what's it called?

5216
02:22:41,230 --> 02:22:43,180
It's called Joe Rogan
questions everything.

5217
02:22:43,240 --> 02:22:44,200
And when does it come out?

5218
02:22:44,400 --> 02:22:45,010
July.

5219
02:22:45,010 --> 02:22:45,760
Okay.

5220
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:48,040
So do you,

5221
02:22:48,400 --> 02:22:48,880
what do you,

5222
02:22:48,880 --> 02:22:52,330
what is it like if you were to go
through all the conspiracy theories about

5223
02:22:52,480 --> 02:22:53,860
Kennedy being assassinated,

5224
02:22:54,490 --> 02:22:57,250
which one do you think is
probably holds the most water?

5225
02:22:57,340 --> 02:22:59,470
I just watched a new documentary
about it this weekend.

5226
02:22:59,530 --> 02:22:59,890
Did you?

5227
02:22:59,890 --> 02:23:00,101
Yeah,

5228
02:23:00,101 --> 02:23:00,821
it's called last shot.

5229
02:23:00,821 --> 02:23:01,480
JFK.

5230
02:23:01,480 --> 02:23:02,261
So the interview,

5231
02:23:02,261 --> 02:23:03,340
this guy was a prisoner.

5232
02:23:03,610 --> 02:23:04,010
It was,

5233
02:23:04,010 --> 02:23:04,540
uh,

5234
02:23:04,540 --> 02:23:06,970
worked with Sam Giancana and the mob.

5235
02:23:07,020 --> 02:23:07,853
Is it three years ago?

5236
02:23:08,030 --> 02:23:09,560
Gives up information as deathbed.

5237
02:23:09,590 --> 02:23:10,120
That one.

5238
02:23:10,120 --> 02:23:10,310
He,

5239
02:23:10,310 --> 02:23:10,821
well he was,

5240
02:23:10,821 --> 02:23:11,031
no,

5241
02:23:11,031 --> 02:23:13,880
he was actually in prison and
they were interviewing him.

5242
02:23:14,060 --> 02:23:14,511
And A,

5243
02:23:14,511 --> 02:23:19,370
I don't know why when it came out or why
came out when we put it up right now.

5244
02:23:19,640 --> 02:23:19,911
But,

5245
02:23:19,911 --> 02:23:20,630
uh,

5246
02:23:20,630 --> 02:23:22,400
I thought it was fascinating.

5247
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:23,960
I don't know if he's telling the truth.

5248
02:23:24,050 --> 02:23:24,181
Oh,

5249
02:23:24,181 --> 02:23:25,014
so what did he say?

5250
02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:25,761
Well,

5251
02:23:25,761 --> 02:23:26,000
he,

5252
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:26,780
he's,

5253
02:23:26,780 --> 02:23:27,650
he believes he,

5254
02:23:27,651 --> 02:23:28,400
uh,

5255
02:23:28,400 --> 02:23:31,760
his name is James files if I l e S.

5256
02:23:32,120 --> 02:23:32,830
Um,

5257
02:23:32,830 --> 02:23:37,830
he gives us very detailed
depiction of the crime about,

5258
02:23:39,051 --> 02:23:39,590
uh,

5259
02:23:39,590 --> 02:23:40,670
how they did what they did,

5260
02:23:40,671 --> 02:23:41,810
why they did what they did,

5261
02:23:42,020 --> 02:23:43,580
what the motivation was behind it,

5262
02:23:43,581 --> 02:23:44,780
and who was involved with and who,

5263
02:23:45,020 --> 02:23:45,381
who,

5264
02:23:45,381 --> 02:23:45,590
uh,

5265
02:23:45,590 --> 02:23:46,430
set the hit up.

5266
02:23:46,880 --> 02:23:47,151
And,

5267
02:23:47,151 --> 02:23:47,331
uh,

5268
02:23:47,331 --> 02:23:51,110
it was a combination with the mob and
the government and they did it because

5269
02:23:51,111 --> 02:23:53,980
they wanted to continue
the war in Southeast Asia.

5270
02:23:54,050 --> 02:23:58,030
There's massive military contracts and
Kennedy was to deciding that he was going

5271
02:23:58,031 --> 02:24:01,010
to pull people out of there and
that he wanted to disband the CIA.

5272
02:24:01,300 --> 02:24:05,360
And so they got together and they took
them out and they use this guy who was a,

5273
02:24:05,390 --> 02:24:06,031
you know,

5274
02:24:06,031 --> 02:24:08,060
a lifelong murderer and gangster,

5275
02:24:08,180 --> 02:24:08,391
so,

5276
02:24:08,391 --> 02:24:10,010
and so Johnson had a hand in it,

5277
02:24:10,011 --> 02:24:10,620
right?

5278
02:24:10,620 --> 02:24:11,190
I don't know.

5279
02:24:11,190 --> 02:24:11,550
You know,

5280
02:24:11,550 --> 02:24:12,000
I don't,

5281
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:13,710
I don't know if this guy knew.

5282
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:14,130
I don't,

5283
02:24:14,130 --> 02:24:15,090
I don't know if he,

5284
02:24:15,091 --> 02:24:15,530
um,

5285
02:24:15,530 --> 02:24:15,791
I'm a,

5286
02:24:15,791 --> 02:24:16,040
I'm,

5287
02:24:16,040 --> 02:24:20,100
I'm sure he didn't get to deal with
Johnson or anyone in the high level.

5288
02:24:20,101 --> 02:24:21,010
He was a mob hit man,

5289
02:24:21,540 --> 02:24:21,751
you know,

5290
02:24:21,751 --> 02:24:22,351
so his,

5291
02:24:22,351 --> 02:24:22,860
uh,

5292
02:24:22,860 --> 02:24:25,170
his story was all the mob side of it all.

5293
02:24:25,290 --> 02:24:25,950
Wow.

5294
02:24:25,950 --> 02:24:26,580
Yeah.

5295
02:24:26,580 --> 02:24:27,690
Pretty believable.

5296
02:24:27,930 --> 02:24:32,640
But it's fucking guy who's in jail
for whatever he's in jail for.

5297
02:24:32,641 --> 02:24:33,540
He's a bad guy.

5298
02:24:33,890 --> 02:24:38,190
He knows what the fuck he dad was a
murderer or whether he shot at a cop who

5299
02:24:38,191 --> 02:24:38,911
knows what he did.

5300
02:24:38,911 --> 02:24:42,600
But it sounds real when
you're talking to him.

5301
02:24:42,630 --> 02:24:47,520
But the reality is no one knows exactly
what the fuck happened except the people

5302
02:24:47,521 --> 02:24:48,354
that were there.

5303
02:24:48,450 --> 02:24:51,150
But there's all out of Lou Shit.

5304
02:24:51,210 --> 02:24:51,570
There's,

5305
02:24:51,570 --> 02:24:53,670
there's a lot of loose strings to that,

5306
02:24:53,790 --> 02:24:54,331
that case,

5307
02:24:54,331 --> 02:24:58,020
including the people who witnessed
the actual assassination themselves.

5308
02:24:58,021 --> 02:24:59,850
How many of them died mysterious,

5309
02:24:59,851 --> 02:25:00,870
horrible crimes.

5310
02:25:01,210 --> 02:25:05,130
And a lot of the people that were eye
witnesses to the Kennedy assassination,

5311
02:25:05,430 --> 02:25:05,641
they,

5312
02:25:05,641 --> 02:25:05,940
oh,

5313
02:25:05,940 --> 02:25:06,661
they died.

5314
02:25:06,661 --> 02:25:07,500
And Weird ways,

5315
02:25:07,501 --> 02:25:08,100
man.

5316
02:25:08,100 --> 02:25:08,251
Yeah,

5317
02:25:08,251 --> 02:25:08,610
I'll pull,

5318
02:25:08,610 --> 02:25:09,443
I'll pull that up.

5319
02:25:11,060 --> 02:25:11,241
Yeah,

5320
02:25:11,241 --> 02:25:12,290
the investigation.

5321
02:25:12,460 --> 02:25:12,800
Uh,

5322
02:25:12,800 --> 02:25:13,431
what was it called?

5323
02:25:13,431 --> 02:25:13,611
The,

5324
02:25:13,611 --> 02:25:14,444
uh,

5325
02:25:14,570 --> 02:25:16,730
the Warren report?

5326
02:25:16,770 --> 02:25:17,410
Yes.

5327
02:25:17,410 --> 02:25:18,380
A really,

5328
02:25:18,381 --> 02:25:19,790
really shoddily done.

5329
02:25:19,880 --> 02:25:21,170
And um,

5330
02:25:21,410 --> 02:25:22,970
most of it was discredited later.

5331
02:25:23,380 --> 02:25:23,980
Have you been following

5332
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:25,960
any of conspiracies
with this Boston thing?

5333
02:25:26,500 --> 02:25:26,651
Oh,

5334
02:25:26,651 --> 02:25:27,640
I haven't heard a word.

5335
02:25:27,670 --> 02:25:28,570
I don't even want to know.

5336
02:25:28,630 --> 02:25:29,301
Look at this one night.

5337
02:25:29,301 --> 02:25:29,770
It's pretty,

5338
02:25:29,770 --> 02:25:30,191
pretty good,

5339
02:25:30,191 --> 02:25:32,860
but I think it's pretty easy to
figure it out by like on the,

5340
02:25:32,861 --> 02:25:34,570
on the corner of the TV,

5341
02:25:34,910 --> 02:25:35,743
see this red,

5342
02:25:35,770 --> 02:25:38,560
it looks like blood or a piece
of meat or something right there.

5343
02:25:38,680 --> 02:25:39,031
Watching him,

5344
02:25:39,031 --> 02:25:40,810
this guy walks by a,

5345
02:25:40,811 --> 02:25:43,690
it just like disappears
like a poorly edited video.

5346
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:44,673
Um,

5347
02:25:44,860 --> 02:25:49,600
and what's crazy about it is that
if you look for this clip on ABC,

5348
02:25:49,630 --> 02:25:50,900
like all the videos on ABC,

5349
02:25:50,901 --> 02:25:53,080
it now cuts off right before he walks by.

5350
02:25:53,210 --> 02:25:54,610
See how it's gone.

5351
02:25:55,310 --> 02:25:59,350
He said that how they used to be a right
thing there and then once he walks by,

5352
02:25:59,950 --> 02:26:00,460
oops.

5353
02:26:00,460 --> 02:26:01,293
Gone.

5354
02:26:01,750 --> 02:26:03,250
And so if you go to,

5355
02:26:03,310 --> 02:26:04,143
uh,

5356
02:26:04,330 --> 02:26:05,130
like a lot of it

5357
02:26:05,130 --> 02:26:05,480
video,

5358
02:26:05,480 --> 02:26:05,991
what does that,

5359
02:26:05,991 --> 02:26:06,370
what do,

5360
02:26:06,370 --> 02:26:07,830
what are people trying to say that is,

5361
02:26:07,860 --> 02:26:08,311
I don't know,

5362
02:26:08,311 --> 02:26:09,390
like poorly edited video.

5363
02:26:09,391 --> 02:26:09,511
So,

5364
02:26:09,511 --> 02:26:09,751
watch,

5365
02:26:09,751 --> 02:26:10,650
see when you see this guy,

5366
02:26:10,750 --> 02:26:11,351
it now,

5367
02:26:11,351 --> 02:26:12,080
it just stops.

5368
02:26:12,080 --> 02:26:13,920
Like they don't even
show him walk by anymore.

5369
02:26:14,110 --> 02:26:18,060
I think shit like this cheapens what
happened when people start putting out

5370
02:26:18,061 --> 02:26:20,520
theories about stuff
before we know any facts.

5371
02:26:20,521 --> 02:26:23,220
And it starts to then not be about,

5372
02:26:23,640 --> 02:26:24,473
um,

5373
02:26:24,510 --> 02:26:26,840
the fact that human lives were lost and

5374
02:26:26,940 --> 02:26:27,081
well,

5375
02:26:27,081 --> 02:26:27,141
no,

5376
02:26:27,141 --> 02:26:28,640
I don't even know what
that wasn't the ground.

5377
02:26:28,641 --> 02:26:31,970
I mean it might've been one piece of
paper that moved when he passed by it.

5378
02:26:31,971 --> 02:26:32,090
Right.

5379
02:26:32,090 --> 02:26:32,721
That's what I'm saying.

5380
02:26:32,721 --> 02:26:33,110
So I've,

5381
02:26:33,110 --> 02:26:33,411
uh,

5382
02:26:33,411 --> 02:26:36,950
I've actually found a
unedited video from that,

5383
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:37,410
that,

5384
02:26:37,410 --> 02:26:37,940
uh,

5385
02:26:37,940 --> 02:26:39,800
shows what it seems to be.

5386
02:26:40,090 --> 02:26:40,360
Uh,

5387
02:26:40,360 --> 02:26:40,751
and it's,

5388
02:26:40,751 --> 02:26:42,290
it's just like a piece of,

5389
02:26:42,320 --> 02:26:42,771
of,

5390
02:26:42,771 --> 02:26:43,460
uh,

5391
02:26:43,460 --> 02:26:45,980
it looks like a flag or a ribbon to watch.

5392
02:26:46,600 --> 02:26:47,433
Um,

5393
02:26:47,870 --> 02:26:49,010
I think it's coming up right here,

5394
02:26:49,250 --> 02:26:49,880
but uh,

5395
02:26:49,880 --> 02:26:50,720
right when he walks by,

5396
02:26:50,721 --> 02:26:53,030
you could see it like it's
a pulled more pulled out.

5397
02:26:53,740 --> 02:26:54,171
Oh Shit.

5398
02:26:54,171 --> 02:26:55,450
I don't even remember where it is very,

5399
02:26:55,750 --> 02:26:56,410
it doesn't matter.

5400
02:26:56,410 --> 02:26:56,791
But anyway,

5401
02:26:56,791 --> 02:26:57,310
so yeah,

5402
02:26:57,310 --> 02:26:58,180
it was a ribbon.

5403
02:26:58,290 --> 02:27:00,900
So like all these people online
are freaking out and like,

5404
02:27:00,980 --> 02:27:01,300
like,

5405
02:27:01,300 --> 02:27:01,640
like,

5406
02:27:01,640 --> 02:27:01,840
like,

5407
02:27:01,840 --> 02:27:02,051
oh,

5408
02:27:02,051 --> 02:27:02,201
it's,

5409
02:27:02,201 --> 02:27:02,530
you know,

5410
02:27:02,530 --> 02:27:03,610
a poorly edited video.

5411
02:27:03,611 --> 02:27:07,690
That media is tricking us where it just
took me maybe 10 minutes to find a video

5412
02:27:07,691 --> 02:27:09,960
that wasn't shit.

5413
02:27:10,330 --> 02:27:10,661
Like,

5414
02:27:10,661 --> 02:27:15,661
can't you just be a human being for 48
hours and say this was a fucked up thing

5415
02:27:15,881 --> 02:27:16,451
that happened.

5416
02:27:16,451 --> 02:27:20,800
We have even finding who did
it isn't my first response.

5417
02:27:20,801 --> 02:27:21,634
It's like,

5418
02:27:21,970 --> 02:27:22,601
why do you,

5419
02:27:22,601 --> 02:27:23,270
like you said,

5420
02:27:23,270 --> 02:27:28,270
how is it a human being is capable of
this and how do we fucking heal this?

5421
02:27:28,960 --> 02:27:31,060
But to all the sudden start to like,

5422
02:27:31,360 --> 02:27:35,920
will so it's caused because
of this person or this agency.

5423
02:27:35,921 --> 02:27:36,754
It's like,

5424
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,310
let it fucking let the bodies cool.

5425
02:27:40,510 --> 02:27:41,290
Um,

5426
02:27:41,290 --> 02:27:41,980
Kennedy,

5427
02:27:41,980 --> 02:27:44,500
by the time a 1967 came along,

5428
02:27:45,220 --> 02:27:47,440
103 of the witnesses were dead.

5429
02:27:48,160 --> 02:27:49,120
What?

5430
02:27:50,260 --> 02:27:51,093
That's crazy.

5431
02:27:51,730 --> 02:27:52,600
Seriously?

5432
02:27:53,990 --> 02:27:54,490
Yeah.

5433
02:27:54,490 --> 02:27:55,323
103.

5434
02:27:55,810 --> 02:27:56,650
Well,

5435
02:27:59,320 --> 02:28:00,640
is that part of the documentary?

5436
02:28:01,120 --> 02:28:01,300
No,

5437
02:28:01,300 --> 02:28:02,133
this is another one.

5438
02:28:02,360 --> 02:28:03,193
This is another,

5439
02:28:03,260 --> 02:28:06,050
this to website depicting the,

5440
02:28:06,051 --> 02:28:06,470
the,

5441
02:28:06,470 --> 02:28:06,831
the,

5442
02:28:06,831 --> 02:28:07,664
uh,

5443
02:28:07,730 --> 02:28:09,740
the witnesses for the assassination.

5444
02:28:09,741 --> 02:28:10,670
How many of them were,

5445
02:28:10,870 --> 02:28:12,110
were supposedly murdered.

5446
02:28:12,320 --> 02:28:15,120
When you really look at
who the suspects were,

5447
02:28:15,360 --> 02:28:17,610
it's kind of hard to not
say the government when,

5448
02:28:17,611 --> 02:28:18,240
when,

5449
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:19,410
when that administration was,

5450
02:28:19,411 --> 02:28:19,800
was,

5451
02:28:19,800 --> 02:28:20,221
you know,

5452
02:28:20,221 --> 02:28:23,760
going through kind of pushing through
the kind of changes that were going on at

5453
02:28:23,761 --> 02:28:24,594
that time.

5454
02:28:25,250 --> 02:28:25,620
You know,

5455
02:28:25,620 --> 02:28:26,730
whether it was civil rights,

5456
02:28:26,731 --> 02:28:27,120
which,

5457
02:28:27,120 --> 02:28:27,421
you know,

5458
02:28:27,421 --> 02:28:30,630
Johnson obviously had no problem with
Kennedy's politics with the civil rights

5459
02:28:30,631 --> 02:28:30,961
movement,

5460
02:28:30,961 --> 02:28:33,540
but definitely with what
was going on in Vietnam.

5461
02:28:34,650 --> 02:28:35,980
Not to put it all in Johnson who does.

5462
02:28:36,230 --> 02:28:36,411
Yeah.

5463
02:28:36,411 --> 02:28:37,011
Who knows.

5464
02:28:37,011 --> 02:28:38,300
I mean there's,

5465
02:28:38,301 --> 02:28:39,530
there was a lot of shit going on.

5466
02:28:39,531 --> 02:28:40,820
He wanted to get rid of the CIA.

5467
02:28:40,821 --> 02:28:42,530
He wanted to get rid
of the Federal Reserve.

5468
02:28:42,560 --> 02:28:43,550
He wanted to,

5469
02:28:43,551 --> 02:28:43,880
uh,

5470
02:28:43,880 --> 02:28:44,151
get,

5471
02:28:44,151 --> 02:28:44,540
uh,

5472
02:28:44,540 --> 02:28:47,840
get American troops out of
Southeast Asia supposedly.

5473
02:28:48,170 --> 02:28:50,690
And then there was also people that
were mad at him for the Bay of Pigs.

5474
02:28:50,860 --> 02:28:51,200
Right.

5475
02:28:51,200 --> 02:28:51,470
You know,

5476
02:28:51,470 --> 02:28:54,600
that was apparently a big one that
that one apparently motivated.

5477
02:28:54,920 --> 02:28:56,530
I didn't have the juice to do anything,

5478
02:28:56,730 --> 02:28:57,720
but it wasn't Castro.

5479
02:28:57,870 --> 02:28:59,910
It was the people that
died going over there.

5480
02:28:59,960 --> 02:29:00,500
Oh,

5481
02:29:00,500 --> 02:29:00,830
the,

5482
02:29:00,830 --> 02:29:05,340
those like that made him an enemy of
a lot of people in the intelligence

5483
02:29:05,341 --> 02:29:06,170
community.

5484
02:29:06,170 --> 02:29:08,490
A lot of people in the military
and a lot of people in the mob.

5485
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:09,751
So there was a,

5486
02:29:09,751 --> 02:29:11,010
there was a lot going on,

5487
02:29:11,160 --> 02:29:11,461
you know,

5488
02:29:11,461 --> 02:29:11,611
the,

5489
02:29:11,611 --> 02:29:13,410
there's a lot of people
that didn't like the guy.

5490
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:14,820
I mean,

5491
02:29:14,820 --> 02:29:17,070
I think he wanted to be a real president.

5492
02:29:17,370 --> 02:29:18,810
And I think by that time they're,

5493
02:29:18,811 --> 02:29:19,200
you know,

5494
02:29:19,200 --> 02:29:23,730
they had like a whole system and it kinda
had been established and everybody was

5495
02:29:23,731 --> 02:29:26,850
sort of playing along with the
rules that they had established.

5496
02:29:27,060 --> 02:29:28,680
And Kennedy came along and was like,

5497
02:29:28,681 --> 02:29:33,030
what is this CIA and why did they
have more power than the United States

5498
02:29:33,031 --> 02:29:33,864
government?

5499
02:29:33,970 --> 02:29:34,290
You know?

5500
02:29:34,290 --> 02:29:35,250
And then w you know,

5501
02:29:35,251 --> 02:29:37,620
and people would fucking cheer
every time we'd get on TV,

5502
02:29:37,890 --> 02:29:38,251
they be like,

5503
02:29:38,251 --> 02:29:39,590
we got to get rid of this motherfucker.

5504
02:29:39,620 --> 02:29:40,740
He's gonna ruin this whole Party.

5505
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:41,511
Meanwhile,

5506
02:29:41,511 --> 02:29:45,410
he was much more astute
about international politics
than any of those guys

5507
02:29:45,411 --> 02:29:49,610
where he knew he knew his shit and he
knew what was happening in Vietnam and,

5508
02:29:49,611 --> 02:29:49,820
uh,

5509
02:29:49,820 --> 02:29:50,720
they were afraid of it.

5510
02:29:51,660 --> 02:29:52,493
Yeah.

5511
02:29:52,560 --> 02:29:53,900
Well they killed him.

5512
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:54,280
Yeah.

5513
02:29:54,280 --> 02:29:55,113
He got away with it.

5514
02:29:55,140 --> 02:29:55,951
Somehow or another,

5515
02:29:55,951 --> 02:29:56,784
they got away with it.

5516
02:29:56,790 --> 02:30:00,030
Whoever did it got away with it and
anybody who says that Oswald acted alone,

5517
02:30:00,390 --> 02:30:01,910
I've heard those arguments there.

5518
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:02,940
They're preposterous.

5519
02:30:02,990 --> 02:30:06,330
They are preposterous and they are the
arguments of a person who doesn't want to

5520
02:30:06,331 --> 02:30:08,370
believe in any conspiracies there.

5521
02:30:08,371 --> 02:30:10,980
The arguments of a person
who wants to believe it,

5522
02:30:10,981 --> 02:30:11,341
listen,

5523
02:30:11,341 --> 02:30:13,020
sometimes it's just weird.

5524
02:30:13,170 --> 02:30:17,070
Sometimes a guy just lands a headshot
and a moving target from a hundred yards

5525
02:30:17,071 --> 02:30:17,490
away.

5526
02:30:17,490 --> 02:30:18,121
That is true.

5527
02:30:18,121 --> 02:30:19,380
Sometimes that does happen,

5528
02:30:19,381 --> 02:30:21,870
but the preponderance of evidence,

5529
02:30:21,871 --> 02:30:24,270
if you look at it all points to fuckery.

5530
02:30:24,600 --> 02:30:26,670
Most of it in terms of
being a second shooter,

5531
02:30:26,700 --> 02:30:29,640
but not just a second shooter
but maybe more than two.

5532
02:30:29,970 --> 02:30:30,211
You know,

5533
02:30:30,211 --> 02:30:31,080
who knows how many,

5534
02:30:31,081 --> 02:30:32,490
but no question about it.

5535
02:30:32,730 --> 02:30:37,530
More bullets hit things or were shot
at things then were attributed to the

5536
02:30:37,531 --> 02:30:38,730
amount of shots that were taken.

5537
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:41,010
The official record is
if there's three shots.

5538
02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:44,340
Well the only reason why they
had to stick with that was,

5539
02:30:44,550 --> 02:30:45,120
I mean that's,

5540
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:48,090
that's the only reason why they're
created that whole magic bullet theory.

5541
02:30:48,390 --> 02:30:49,350
That's not theory.

5542
02:30:49,351 --> 02:30:51,690
That's based on like a rational track.

5543
02:30:51,730 --> 02:30:55,770
The trajectory of a bullet and then to
come out in a pristine condition the way

5544
02:30:55,771 --> 02:30:56,370
it is.

5545
02:30:56,370 --> 02:30:59,100
They did that because they had to make
up for the fact that they knew that a

5546
02:30:59,101 --> 02:31:00,570
bullet hit the underpass.

5547
02:31:00,780 --> 02:31:04,500
They knew that a bullet hit the curb
stone and ricocheted and fuck this guy's

5548
02:31:04,501 --> 02:31:05,001
head up the,

5549
02:31:05,001 --> 02:31:07,140
I went to the hospital
and they found the curve.

5550
02:31:07,141 --> 02:31:08,100
They saw where the bullet hit,

5551
02:31:08,101 --> 02:31:10,710
so they knew that one bullet
had to be attributed to that.

5552
02:31:10,780 --> 02:31:11,040
Yeah.

5553
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:12,510
So then those wounds,

5554
02:31:12,780 --> 02:31:16,110
you have to figure out how does Connolly
have a wound and Kennedy have a wound

5555
02:31:16,440 --> 02:31:18,210
and they're not like lined up,

5556
02:31:18,211 --> 02:31:20,890
so it's got a and go down and people say,

5557
02:31:20,920 --> 02:31:21,071
well,

5558
02:31:21,071 --> 02:31:21,731
you know what?

5559
02:31:21,731 --> 02:31:22,540
A lot of people,

5560
02:31:22,540 --> 02:31:24,160
strange things happen when bullets,

5561
02:31:24,161 --> 02:31:27,100
it hit bodies and sometimes you know,

5562
02:31:27,130 --> 02:31:29,650
a little weirder word of it seems,

5563
02:31:29,651 --> 02:31:30,810
but sometimes a bullet go,

5564
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:32,020
shut the fuck up.

5565
02:31:32,300 --> 02:31:32,660
No.

5566
02:31:32,660 --> 02:31:35,300
It would take him like three
seconds to reload that gun.

5567
02:31:35,330 --> 02:31:36,060
Yes.

5568
02:31:36,060 --> 02:31:36,730
Well,

5569
02:31:36,730 --> 02:31:40,020
we'd be quick [inaudible] it was
possible to do within a period of time.

5570
02:31:40,021 --> 02:31:43,470
If you were really good and you had
practiced it and you were juiced up with

5571
02:31:43,471 --> 02:31:45,930
adrenaline and you were
excellent at being a marksman,

5572
02:31:46,140 --> 02:31:47,190
it's possible to do that.

5573
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:48,113
That's not the issue.

5574
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:49,200
The issue is the bullet.

5575
02:31:49,201 --> 02:31:52,500
They found that they attribute to this
wacky fucking theory that no one ever

5576
02:31:52,501 --> 02:31:55,460
came up with until they found out that
there was a hole in the underpass.

5577
02:31:55,500 --> 02:31:56,490
They had to make it.

5578
02:31:56,730 --> 02:31:56,851
Oh,

5579
02:31:56,851 --> 02:31:59,520
what's maybe it was more than one
person shooting the fuck there was.

5580
02:31:59,670 --> 02:32:00,870
There was one person shooting.

5581
02:32:00,871 --> 02:32:01,800
He shot three times.

5582
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:02,970
How's that possible?

5583
02:32:03,090 --> 02:32:03,361
Well,

5584
02:32:03,361 --> 02:32:07,860
I guess the bullet went through both
guys and took turns and fucking and wound

5585
02:32:07,861 --> 02:32:09,630
up on the Gurney totally intact.

5586
02:32:09,631 --> 02:32:10,890
Even though it's shattered bone,

5587
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:14,160
which has never happened to a bullet in
the history of the fucking human race

5588
02:32:17,060 --> 02:32:21,870
and the hospital Connolly's
Gurney [inaudible] rolling
them into the hospital.

5589
02:32:21,900 --> 02:32:22,201
Oh look,

5590
02:32:22,201 --> 02:32:22,920
we found the bullet.

5591
02:32:22,920 --> 02:32:23,753
Yay.

5592
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:24,301
Perfect.

5593
02:32:24,301 --> 02:32:25,200
In pristine condition,

5594
02:32:25,201 --> 02:32:27,810
like it had been shot
into a sea of pillows.

5595
02:32:28,100 --> 02:32:28,231
I mean,

5596
02:32:28,231 --> 02:32:29,460
it didn't look like it hit anything.

5597
02:32:29,880 --> 02:32:33,420
If you look at that bullet and look at
a bullet that's actually struck anything

5598
02:32:33,421 --> 02:32:35,370
that strikes bone when things,

5599
02:32:35,400 --> 02:32:37,770
they shattered bones in two
different people's bodies.

5600
02:32:38,050 --> 02:32:41,310
It went through Kennedy and then it
went from Kennedy in economy and the

5601
02:32:41,311 --> 02:32:43,830
eventually shattered his
wrist through his leg,

5602
02:32:43,980 --> 02:32:44,940
whatever the fuck it was.

5603
02:32:45,210 --> 02:32:46,050
There was a bunch of people.

5604
02:32:46,060 --> 02:32:46,270
Sure.

5605
02:32:46,270 --> 02:32:46,840
And then they,

5606
02:32:46,840 --> 02:32:48,930
the autopsy was just open and close.

5607
02:32:49,400 --> 02:32:49,641
Well,

5608
02:32:49,641 --> 02:32:51,500
the autopsy that varies between the,

5609
02:32:51,501 --> 02:32:51,770
um,

5610
02:32:51,770 --> 02:32:53,210
the way he was described,

5611
02:32:53,330 --> 02:32:56,990
the way his body was described in Dallas
than the way his body was described in

5612
02:32:56,991 --> 02:32:57,411
Bethesda,

5613
02:32:57,411 --> 02:32:58,160
Maryland.

5614
02:32:58,160 --> 02:32:59,570
Two completely different descriptions.

5615
02:32:59,810 --> 02:33:02,870
They had generals hovering over
the doctors while they worked,

5616
02:33:03,260 --> 02:33:03,680
you know,

5617
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:05,840
telling them what to do to talk to us who,

5618
02:33:05,841 --> 02:33:06,110
uh,

5619
02:33:06,110 --> 02:33:09,680
talked about the like years and years
later that talked about the autopsy.

5620
02:33:09,681 --> 02:33:11,480
We talked about how tense
the environment was.

5621
02:33:11,481 --> 02:33:11,991
Not Crazy.

5622
02:33:11,991 --> 02:33:12,824
It was,

5623
02:33:12,950 --> 02:33:13,460
you know,

5624
02:33:13,460 --> 02:33:16,310
the is fucking dead was blown apart.

5625
02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:17,141
Meanwhile,

5626
02:33:17,141 --> 02:33:20,380
you have Johnson who at the time is,

5627
02:33:20,710 --> 02:33:22,210
he's about to become the president.

5628
02:33:22,330 --> 02:33:25,360
He's supposed to get the fuck out of
there somewhere safe because they don't

5629
02:33:25,361 --> 02:33:26,194
know if there is,

5630
02:33:26,380 --> 02:33:26,621
if they,

5631
02:33:26,621 --> 02:33:27,454
if they didn't,

5632
02:33:27,550 --> 02:33:31,270
if they really believe there was more
than one shooter than he should have been

5633
02:33:31,271 --> 02:33:31,931
added there.

5634
02:33:31,931 --> 02:33:32,201
I mean,

5635
02:33:32,201 --> 02:33:33,040
I mean that's protocol.

5636
02:33:33,041 --> 02:33:36,940
He did not need to be there to get sworn
in that he could have done that a week

5637
02:33:36,940 --> 02:33:36,941
later.

5638
02:33:36,941 --> 02:33:37,774
It didn't matter.

5639
02:33:37,900 --> 02:33:38,340
But he,

5640
02:33:38,340 --> 02:33:38,690
he,

5641
02:33:38,690 --> 02:33:39,700
he kept his cool,

5642
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:40,593
stuck around,

5643
02:33:40,600 --> 02:33:44,260
orchestrated a photo op on Air Force
One and being sworn in with Jackie,

5644
02:33:44,470 --> 02:33:46,270
Jackie o instead of getting,

5645
02:33:46,271 --> 02:33:47,200
getting out of there,

5646
02:33:47,201 --> 02:33:49,150
which didn't make sense.

5647
02:33:51,290 --> 02:33:52,081
Does have you,

5648
02:33:52,081 --> 02:33:52,320
yeah,

5649
02:33:52,320 --> 02:33:53,160
he probably knew.

5650
02:33:53,520 --> 02:33:54,353
He probably knew.

5651
02:33:54,550 --> 02:33:55,270
Hmm.

5652
02:33:55,270 --> 02:33:56,103
They killed him.

5653
02:33:56,190 --> 02:33:57,023
They killed him.

5654
02:33:57,540 --> 02:33:58,350
You know,

5655
02:33:58,350 --> 02:33:59,580
it's a dirty business.

5656
02:33:59,610 --> 02:34:01,110
It's like game of Thrones,

5657
02:34:01,230 --> 02:34:04,980
but it's in 1963 or 62 or
whatever it was when he died.

5658
02:34:05,060 --> 02:34:07,920
62 do you think it would be
harder to kill a president now?

5659
02:34:07,970 --> 02:34:08,150
Yeah,

5660
02:34:08,150 --> 02:34:08,420
it was.

5661
02:34:08,420 --> 02:34:09,270
Then we would have more,

5662
02:34:09,540 --> 02:34:10,410
but they could still do it.

5663
02:34:11,680 --> 02:34:12,341
They could still do it.

5664
02:34:12,341 --> 02:34:16,060
I'm surprised drones aren't
being used by other terror.

5665
02:34:16,061 --> 02:34:16,241
I mean,

5666
02:34:16,241 --> 02:34:16,990
you think about,

5667
02:34:16,990 --> 02:34:17,231
you know,

5668
02:34:17,231 --> 02:34:18,130
I don't know shit about it,

5669
02:34:18,131 --> 02:34:21,400
but you can go to a toy store and get
a helicopter that works with a remote

5670
02:34:21,401 --> 02:34:24,160
control and put it and put
a small explosive on it.

5671
02:34:24,340 --> 02:34:25,420
Now take that time,

5672
02:34:25,421 --> 02:34:29,500
somebody who can afford a
$20,000 version of that,

5673
02:34:29,530 --> 02:34:33,130
how hard it would be to kill
a president who's driving,

5674
02:34:33,190 --> 02:34:33,521
you know,

5675
02:34:33,521 --> 02:34:34,354
in a motorcade.

5676
02:34:34,570 --> 02:34:35,180
Yeah.

5677
02:34:35,180 --> 02:34:40,160
Well if you know those cars that they
have or bomb resistant and bullet

5678
02:34:40,161 --> 02:34:40,994
resistant,

5679
02:34:41,300 --> 02:34:41,780
you know,

5680
02:34:41,780 --> 02:34:43,100
it's not to say that you couldn't,

5681
02:34:43,340 --> 02:34:45,170
it would be hard to
get through those cars.

5682
02:34:45,260 --> 02:34:48,370
But what about a speech that you'd have
to find something where he's outdoors

5683
02:34:48,470 --> 02:34:49,520
and I mean,

5684
02:34:49,521 --> 02:34:50,810
it's possible someone,

5685
02:34:50,870 --> 02:34:55,160
someone could probably figure out a way
with technology to get to a president.

5686
02:34:56,120 --> 02:34:56,840
You know,

5687
02:34:56,840 --> 02:34:59,540
I'm just surprised you don't
see more than one has done it.

5688
02:34:59,541 --> 02:35:00,230
Thank God.

5689
02:35:00,230 --> 02:35:00,411
Well,

5690
02:35:00,411 --> 02:35:01,520
maybe that's the future.

5691
02:35:01,820 --> 02:35:02,001
I mean,

5692
02:35:02,001 --> 02:35:02,451
what could we,

5693
02:35:02,451 --> 02:35:02,811
this,

5694
02:35:02,811 --> 02:35:04,040
this Boston thing,

5695
02:35:04,400 --> 02:35:05,600
what if this is the beginning?

5696
02:35:05,601 --> 02:35:05,900
I mean,

5697
02:35:05,900 --> 02:35:06,130
you know,

5698
02:35:06,130 --> 02:35:06,361
we've,

5699
02:35:06,361 --> 02:35:10,340
we've endured piece or we've enjoyed
peace rather in this country for the last

5700
02:35:10,760 --> 02:35:11,870
12 plus years.

5701
02:35:12,260 --> 02:35:14,000
Since September 11th you know,

5702
02:35:14,090 --> 02:35:14,810
or 11 years,

5703
02:35:14,810 --> 02:35:15,740
11 plus years.

5704
02:35:16,010 --> 02:35:17,450
So it's not,

5705
02:35:18,200 --> 02:35:18,501
you know,

5706
02:35:18,501 --> 02:35:23,120
it's not outside the realm of possibility
that this is the beginning of some new

5707
02:35:23,121 --> 02:35:24,620
era where shit like this happened.

5708
02:35:24,670 --> 02:35:25,210
It's all gone.

5709
02:35:25,210 --> 02:35:25,881
It's going to happen.

5710
02:35:25,881 --> 02:35:26,840
I'd go back to it.

5711
02:35:26,841 --> 02:35:31,841
The media will strengthen the cause of
people that do things like this by making

5712
02:35:32,991 --> 02:35:36,140
it a hotter story than it needs
to be for the wrong reasons.

5713
02:35:36,360 --> 02:35:37,193
Yeah.

5714
02:35:37,230 --> 02:35:41,580
Do you think that that's an unavoidable
that one day there'll be able to figure

5715
02:35:41,581 --> 02:35:42,780
out how to not do that?

5716
02:35:43,600 --> 02:35:44,260
I,

5717
02:35:44,260 --> 02:35:47,480
it's hard to imagine because it seems
like it's gotten worse with that

5718
02:35:47,540 --> 02:35:48,201
more outlets.

5719
02:35:48,201 --> 02:35:51,800
There's more people competing for a story
so people are willing to do anything

5720
02:35:51,801 --> 02:35:52,700
to get a story

5721
02:35:52,890 --> 02:35:57,890
and culturally it's like how far do we
have to evolve before these things like

5722
02:35:58,530 --> 02:36:02,700
mass bombings and deaths and you know
the fucking tower shooters where that

5723
02:36:02,701 --> 02:36:03,600
never happens anymore.

5724
02:36:03,601 --> 02:36:06,390
Is that a possibility that we've
got to reach a 0.1 day where,

5725
02:36:06,660 --> 02:36:09,840
I mean there's a lot of shit that we
don't do anymore pretty much across the

5726
02:36:09,841 --> 02:36:10,674
board.

5727
02:36:11,010 --> 02:36:12,210
But if you get,

5728
02:36:12,430 --> 02:36:16,950
is there a point ever we can get to at
least in a country by country basis where

5729
02:36:16,951 --> 02:36:18,630
you can completely eradicate that shit.

5730
02:36:18,750 --> 02:36:23,750
Terrorism all tell her anything
ridiculous like that and mass murder,

5731
02:36:24,580 --> 02:36:28,120
as long as there is a force
of people that's weaker,

5732
02:36:28,190 --> 02:36:28,390
uh,

5733
02:36:28,390 --> 02:36:31,670
that has no voice and has
no say and they want to,

5734
02:36:31,720 --> 02:36:31,991
you know,

5735
02:36:31,991 --> 02:36:35,350
you look at with the Palestinians
did and Munich in 1972,

5736
02:36:35,440 --> 02:36:35,860
you know,

5737
02:36:35,860 --> 02:36:36,640
they were nothing.

5738
02:36:36,640 --> 02:36:39,520
People were fucking completely
ignoring them and then they,

5739
02:36:39,521 --> 02:36:39,910
uh,

5740
02:36:39,910 --> 02:36:40,360
they,

5741
02:36:40,360 --> 02:36:43,150
they blew some shit up and all of a
sudden they were on the map and they,

5742
02:36:43,590 --> 02:36:44,320
you know,

5743
02:36:44,320 --> 02:36:45,490
but isn't it a an odd,

5744
02:36:46,030 --> 02:36:47,270
we are almost willing.

5745
02:36:47,300 --> 02:36:51,200
The reason why I asked the question I
asked it before many people really is

5746
02:36:51,201 --> 02:36:55,820
because we're willing to accept the idea
that we're never going to get our shit

5747
02:36:55,821 --> 02:36:56,654
together.

5748
02:36:56,900 --> 02:36:57,171
You know,

5749
02:36:57,171 --> 02:36:57,890
like I'll,

5750
02:36:57,890 --> 02:36:58,610
I'll say,

5751
02:36:58,610 --> 02:37:01,310
is it possible there will be
a day where there's no war

5752
02:37:03,110 --> 02:37:04,130
people like no,

5753
02:37:04,460 --> 02:37:06,770
no friends on the definition of war,

5754
02:37:07,160 --> 02:37:07,641
while any,

5755
02:37:07,641 --> 02:37:08,000
okay.

5756
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:11,520
Any violence whatsoever
amongst human beings like the,

5757
02:37:11,700 --> 02:37:13,670
if the reality of this room,

5758
02:37:13,700 --> 02:37:14,010
okay,

5759
02:37:14,010 --> 02:37:14,843
let's look at it this way.

5760
02:37:15,230 --> 02:37:17,240
If there's four of us and we,

5761
02:37:17,241 --> 02:37:17,571
you know,

5762
02:37:17,571 --> 02:37:19,910
we are the only people
left on this planet,

5763
02:37:20,180 --> 02:37:22,220
what are the odds that we'll go to war?

5764
02:37:22,280 --> 02:37:23,600
It's 100% that we won't,

5765
02:37:23,960 --> 02:37:24,321
you know,

5766
02:37:24,321 --> 02:37:25,170
I'm not going to go to war.

5767
02:37:25,171 --> 02:37:25,921
You're not going to go to war.

5768
02:37:25,921 --> 02:37:26,840
He's not going to go to war.

5769
02:37:26,841 --> 02:37:28,490
He's not going to go to or where you know,

5770
02:37:28,491 --> 02:37:29,690
at the very least we're going to be like,

5771
02:37:29,840 --> 02:37:29,991
well,

5772
02:37:29,991 --> 02:37:30,920
fuck you man.

5773
02:37:31,860 --> 02:37:32,720
I'm gonna go.

5774
02:37:32,750 --> 02:37:33,360
I'll see ya.

5775
02:37:33,360 --> 02:37:34,193
And that's the end.

5776
02:37:34,410 --> 02:37:36,360
Is that going to be any
limited amount of food?

5777
02:37:36,940 --> 02:37:37,270
Yeah.

5778
02:37:37,270 --> 02:37:38,530
Well that's when things get sketchy.

5779
02:37:38,531 --> 02:37:40,000
But is that really what's going on?

5780
02:37:40,001 --> 02:37:40,271
No,

5781
02:37:40,271 --> 02:37:41,530
it's been so weird.

5782
02:37:41,531 --> 02:37:45,010
Creepy Battle of resources
and hogging the re.

5783
02:37:45,410 --> 02:37:46,720
But point being,

5784
02:37:47,320 --> 02:37:52,320
we're not willing to ever conceive of of
an even a possibility of one day where

5785
02:37:54,431 --> 02:37:56,590
people no longer have any crime,

5786
02:37:56,840 --> 02:37:58,330
no longer have any war,

5787
02:37:58,360 --> 02:37:59,650
no longer have any murder,

5788
02:38:00,070 --> 02:38:01,000
no hate crimes,

5789
02:38:01,001 --> 02:38:01,691
no racism.

5790
02:38:01,691 --> 02:38:02,524
It's all gone.

5791
02:38:02,770 --> 02:38:03,970
It's gone in your life.

5792
02:38:04,150 --> 02:38:06,370
Greg Fitzsimmons is racism free,

5793
02:38:06,610 --> 02:38:08,410
your hate free violence free.

5794
02:38:08,860 --> 02:38:09,693
You're a nice guy.

5795
02:38:09,700 --> 02:38:10,061
You know,

5796
02:38:10,061 --> 02:38:10,870
like you,

5797
02:38:10,870 --> 02:38:11,350
you,

5798
02:38:11,350 --> 02:38:14,200
if their world was all
just Greg Fitzsimmons,

5799
02:38:14,440 --> 02:38:16,360
there would be no crime in the world to,

5800
02:38:16,361 --> 02:38:17,560
it'd be no war in the world.

5801
02:38:17,890 --> 02:38:18,341
But we're,

5802
02:38:18,341 --> 02:38:23,300
none of us are willing to even conceive
of the possibility of that existing know

5803
02:38:23,950 --> 02:38:24,221
as a,

5804
02:38:24,221 --> 02:38:26,170
as a rule amongst humans,

5805
02:38:26,440 --> 02:38:26,860
it's like,

5806
02:38:26,860 --> 02:38:27,490
Eh,

5807
02:38:27,490 --> 02:38:28,790
it's probably not going to ever happen

5808
02:38:29,320 --> 02:38:32,930
cause we can't stop everything
that happened before.

5809
02:38:32,931 --> 02:38:33,171
I mean,

5810
02:38:33,171 --> 02:38:35,990
most violence is a reaction
to previous violence.

5811
02:38:36,260 --> 02:38:36,651
You know,

5812
02:38:36,651 --> 02:38:41,210
most terrorist organizations have had
suffered something in the past that

5813
02:38:41,211 --> 02:38:42,380
they're trying to right a wrong,

5814
02:38:42,381 --> 02:38:42,561
you know,

5815
02:38:42,561 --> 02:38:44,430
whether it's the IRA or you know,

5816
02:38:44,450 --> 02:38:45,350
the Palestinians,

5817
02:38:45,351 --> 02:38:45,890
it's,

5818
02:38:45,890 --> 02:38:46,910
it's basically,

5819
02:38:47,150 --> 02:38:47,870
um,

5820
02:38:47,870 --> 02:38:52,400
a guy will fight you because he got
beat up when he was a kid by his father.

5821
02:38:52,401 --> 02:38:53,330
So now he's violent.

5822
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:54,351
So it's almost like,

5823
02:38:54,351 --> 02:38:56,150
how do you start over?

5824
02:38:56,151 --> 02:38:57,650
How do you stop it all and just say,

5825
02:38:57,651 --> 02:38:58,460
okay,

5826
02:38:58,460 --> 02:38:59,293
clean slate.

5827
02:38:59,510 --> 02:39:00,230
No violence.

5828
02:39:00,230 --> 02:39:01,063
Mushrooms.

5829
02:39:01,700 --> 02:39:02,360
There you go.

5830
02:39:02,360 --> 02:39:03,530
I'm going to get them all on mushrooms,

5831
02:39:03,531 --> 02:39:03,890
Greg.

5832
02:39:03,890 --> 02:39:04,670
Fuck yeah.

5833
02:39:04,670 --> 02:39:05,480
The whole world.

5834
02:39:05,480 --> 02:39:06,313
Yeah.

5835
02:39:07,610 --> 02:39:08,443
That's your job.

5836
02:39:09,140 --> 02:39:10,220
I can get me on him.

5837
02:39:11,390 --> 02:39:11,601
I mean,

5838
02:39:11,601 --> 02:39:12,740
it's baby steps,

5839
02:39:12,741 --> 02:39:13,450
right?

5840
02:39:13,450 --> 02:39:14,260
Baby steps.

5841
02:39:14,260 --> 02:39:15,080
Indeed.

5842
02:39:15,080 --> 02:39:15,380
Tell.

5843
02:39:15,380 --> 02:39:17,510
Tell the the fine people
where they can find you.

5844
02:39:17,570 --> 02:39:19,730
Greg Fitzsimmons Simmons will be,

5845
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:20,121
uh,

5846
02:39:20,121 --> 02:39:20,781
at the,

5847
02:39:20,781 --> 02:39:21,050
uh,

5848
02:39:21,050 --> 02:39:22,880
monsoon comedy festival.

5849
02:39:22,881 --> 02:39:25,430
Moontower comedy festival in Austin,

5850
02:39:25,431 --> 02:39:25,911
Texas.

5851
02:39:25,911 --> 02:39:27,080
That's coming up next week.

5852
02:39:27,830 --> 02:39:28,760
Cap City.

5853
02:39:29,860 --> 02:39:31,520
It's sunny there.

5854
02:39:31,521 --> 02:39:32,181
April,

5855
02:39:32,181 --> 02:39:32,660
uh,

5856
02:39:32,660 --> 02:39:34,940
24 through 27.

5857
02:39:35,150 --> 02:39:36,170
And then I will be,

5858
02:39:36,171 --> 02:39:40,640
I gotta be at the Ice House in Pasadena
coming up in May for the first time.

5859
02:39:40,641 --> 02:39:41,900
I've never really worked there.

5860
02:39:42,050 --> 02:39:43,250
I've hung out with you guys there,

5861
02:39:43,251 --> 02:39:44,084
but uh,

5862
02:39:44,520 --> 02:39:44,900
I'm going to,

5863
02:39:44,900 --> 02:39:45,740
I'm going to go do it.

5864
02:39:45,741 --> 02:39:48,740
That's going to be on the 18th of May.

5865
02:39:48,890 --> 02:39:49,723
Come in that week.

5866
02:39:49,730 --> 02:39:50,480
We'll pump it up.

5867
02:39:50,480 --> 02:39:50,691
Oh,

5868
02:39:50,691 --> 02:39:51,420
that'd be great.

5869
02:39:51,420 --> 02:39:51,700
Yeah,

5870
02:39:51,700 --> 02:39:52,520
let's do that.

5871
02:39:52,520 --> 02:39:53,900
And then obviously if you,

5872
02:39:53,901 --> 02:39:54,081
uh,

5873
02:39:54,081 --> 02:39:56,060
if you are in the mood and
you think it might help,

5874
02:39:56,360 --> 02:39:56,541
uh,

5875
02:39:56,541 --> 02:39:56,901
come,

5876
02:39:56,901 --> 02:39:59,690
come see me in Boston at Nick's
comedy stop this weekend.

5877
02:39:59,691 --> 02:40:00,524
And uh,

5878
02:40:00,530 --> 02:40:01,311
and if you're not,

5879
02:40:01,311 --> 02:40:04,190
then my thoughts and prayers are
with all the people in Boston.

5880
02:40:04,191 --> 02:40:05,024
And um,

5881
02:40:05,360 --> 02:40:05,830
you know,

5882
02:40:05,830 --> 02:40:06,040
well,

5883
02:40:06,040 --> 02:40:07,570
mine's pretty amazing.

5884
02:40:07,571 --> 02:40:08,420
Going back to Nick's.

5885
02:40:08,620 --> 02:40:09,210
That's uh,

5886
02:40:09,210 --> 02:40:10,870
that's fucking old school for us.

5887
02:40:11,050 --> 02:40:14,980
Literally the first stage that as stitches
and next for the first stage as we

5888
02:40:14,981 --> 02:40:15,870
ever did stand out.

5889
02:40:15,980 --> 02:40:16,251
Yeah,

5890
02:40:16,251 --> 02:40:16,761
that's a,

5891
02:40:16,761 --> 02:40:17,910
we saw some wild shit there.

5892
02:40:17,960 --> 02:40:22,220
You and I saw bill Hicks bomb and clear
the room and that place right while we

5893
02:40:22,221 --> 02:40:23,660
were howling laughing.

5894
02:40:24,250 --> 02:40:24,600
Yeah.

5895
02:40:24,600 --> 02:40:26,840
He literally cleared.

5896
02:40:26,870 --> 02:40:30,380
He went on after the comic
on a Harley Larry Nelson.

5897
02:40:30,410 --> 02:40:31,370
Remember he went up,

5898
02:40:31,730 --> 02:40:34,130
killed Hicks goes on and just,

5899
02:40:34,250 --> 02:40:38,600
it's just people are just getting up and
full tables and leaving and he's doing

5900
02:40:38,601 --> 02:40:40,490
this bit where Oprah Winfrey,

5901
02:40:40,491 --> 02:40:45,491
John Davidson gets fucked in the
ass by Satan and Satan shoots his,

5902
02:40:46,411 --> 02:40:46,641
his,

5903
02:40:46,641 --> 02:40:50,000
his demon load into John
Davidson and John Davidson from,

5904
02:40:50,001 --> 02:40:50,751
that's incredible.

5905
02:40:50,751 --> 02:40:55,700
The TV show swells up in the off
season and he shits out Geraldo Rivera.

5906
02:40:56,200 --> 02:40:57,033
Do you remember?

5907
02:40:57,050 --> 02:40:57,883
He's like,

5908
02:40:58,250 --> 02:40:59,570
cause the devil fucked him in the ass.

5909
02:40:59,600 --> 02:41:04,130
So Hicks is doing this bit or he's like
bent over like he's taking a shit and

5910
02:41:04,131 --> 02:41:08,870
he's grunting and groaning
like is shifting for like
minutes and he just looks

5911
02:41:08,871 --> 02:41:10,370
up as people just getting up and leaving.

5912
02:41:10,371 --> 02:41:10,581
He goes,

5913
02:41:10,581 --> 02:41:10,940
Yup.

5914
02:41:10,940 --> 02:41:13,910
That usually clears the room and you,

5915
02:41:14,270 --> 02:41:17,120
that's exactly how you were
somebody you just through your head.

5916
02:41:17,180 --> 02:41:17,720
I'm not,

5917
02:41:17,720 --> 02:41:22,720
that's my memory of that
day is you laughing at Hicks
saying that usually clears

5918
02:41:24,291 --> 02:41:25,124
the room.

5919
02:41:25,460 --> 02:41:27,860
It was like maybe us at the end of it all.

5920
02:41:27,861 --> 02:41:28,101
I mean,

5921
02:41:28,101 --> 02:41:29,300
how many just nick seat.

5922
02:41:29,330 --> 02:41:34,330
What's the two 50 so it was probably
almost totally packed when Hicks went on

5923
02:41:34,961 --> 02:41:35,660
stage,

5924
02:41:35,660 --> 02:41:36,471
by the time it was over,

5925
02:41:36,471 --> 02:41:39,050
there's like 50 people in
the audience and 10 comics

5926
02:41:39,650 --> 02:41:42,620
pissed that people were laughing at the
comics that went ahead of him cause he

5927
02:41:42,621 --> 02:41:45,470
thought there were so bad
that he had an agenda.

5928
02:41:45,890 --> 02:41:46,723
He was never,

5929
02:41:46,730 --> 02:41:48,740
there was never a goal to make them laugh.

5930
02:41:48,770 --> 02:41:49,603
No,

5931
02:41:49,830 --> 02:41:50,161
no,

5932
02:41:50,161 --> 02:41:51,210
it was he,

5933
02:41:51,211 --> 02:41:51,601
you know,

5934
02:41:51,601 --> 02:41:53,070
he was upset and he was,

5935
02:41:53,071 --> 02:41:53,401
you know,

5936
02:41:53,401 --> 02:41:54,230
he was also,

5937
02:41:54,230 --> 02:41:54,480
you know,

5938
02:41:54,480 --> 02:41:55,440
sort of trying to,

5939
02:41:55,441 --> 02:41:56,274
like,

5940
02:41:57,240 --> 02:41:58,500
it was trying to make a statement.

5941
02:41:58,660 --> 02:41:59,870
He was in a bad spot.

5942
02:42:00,360 --> 02:42:02,220
He used to bomb a lot around that time.

5943
02:42:02,221 --> 02:42:03,031
I think it was angry.

5944
02:42:03,031 --> 02:42:04,490
I Dunno what was going
on with his drinking,

5945
02:42:04,500 --> 02:42:07,230
but he was not up killing
night after night.

5946
02:42:07,330 --> 02:42:07,631
Well,

5947
02:42:07,631 --> 02:42:07,931
it was,

5948
02:42:07,931 --> 02:42:08,770
it was interesting.

5949
02:42:08,790 --> 02:42:09,930
It's interesting to watch it,

5950
02:42:09,940 --> 02:42:13,780
but it was also interesting to see a guy
who really actually didn't give a fuck.

5951
02:42:14,080 --> 02:42:15,820
Not a guy who wasn't pretending.

5952
02:42:15,860 --> 02:42:16,693
Right.

5953
02:42:16,810 --> 02:42:17,530
Guys per day.

5954
02:42:17,530 --> 02:42:18,363
I don't care.

5955
02:42:18,370 --> 02:42:19,510
I ain't getting paid either.

5956
02:42:19,511 --> 02:42:20,530
Whether you laugh at night,

5957
02:42:20,590 --> 02:42:21,850
but we saw the real,

5958
02:42:21,910 --> 02:42:22,650
the real person,

5959
02:42:22,650 --> 02:42:23,850
exactly what it was.

5960
02:42:23,851 --> 02:42:25,950
He truly did not fund it.

5961
02:42:25,951 --> 02:42:29,250
Not if there was one
percentage of him that cared,

5962
02:42:29,550 --> 02:42:31,320
the whole thing would have
fallen down like a hall.

5963
02:42:31,360 --> 02:42:31,561
Yeah.

5964
02:42:31,561 --> 02:42:32,394
House of cards.

5965
02:42:32,670 --> 02:42:33,451
But he didn't care.

5966
02:42:33,451 --> 02:42:34,220
He didn't care.

5967
02:42:34,220 --> 02:42:35,730
It was a fascinating to watch.

5968
02:42:35,731 --> 02:42:36,480
You know,

5969
02:42:36,480 --> 02:42:37,290
we got real lucky.

5970
02:42:37,290 --> 02:42:38,250
That's Nick's this weekend,

5971
02:42:38,251 --> 02:42:38,431
right?

5972
02:42:38,431 --> 02:42:39,264
You're going to be there.

5973
02:42:39,600 --> 02:42:39,991
That's it.

5974
02:42:39,991 --> 02:42:40,471
I'll be there.

5975
02:42:40,471 --> 02:42:41,560
And then Fitz dog radio.

5976
02:42:41,561 --> 02:42:43,260
Is The podcast powerful?

5977
02:42:43,320 --> 02:42:43,550
Correct.

5978
02:42:43,550 --> 02:42:44,383
He's Fitzsimmons.

5979
02:42:44,540 --> 02:42:45,373

5980
02:42:45,380 --> 02:42:45,860

5981
02:42:45,860 --> 02:42:46,420

and San Francisco again?

5986
02:42:49,460 --> 02:42:49,700

which is a Friday and Saturday.

5989
02:42:53,481 --> 02:42:56,000
And then May 5th in San Francisco.

5990
02:42:56,001 --> 02:42:57,230
So San Sacramento,

5991
02:42:57,231 --> 02:42:58,064
May 3rd and fourth,

5992
02:42:58,110 --> 02:42:59,370
both great places.

5993
02:42:59,430 --> 02:43:00,061
Sacramento,

5994
02:43:00,061 --> 02:43:01,630
the punchlines fucking awesome.

5995
02:43:01,631 --> 02:43:05,100
That's another perfect comedy
club and Cobbs is amazing as well.
