1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,300
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are live,

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,860
live on the podcast with the voice.
Michael Chavela,

3
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:12,810
a meeting of the minds,
ladies and gentlemen,

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,860
to mixed martial arts soon as if you 
will,

5
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:19,200
together on a podcast sponsored by the 
way,

6
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:20,820
by the flashlight,
as always.

7
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:23,340
Now they have a new avatar version.
Now it's not really avatar.

8
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:24,780
They can't say Avatar,
but you know what?

9
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:28,060
You're fucking blue vagina.
These are like that.

10
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:30,030
But in Tokyo they could tenders over 
there.

11
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:32,010
They're huge sellers,
a don quixote stores,

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,110
which for us mixed martial arts fans 
don't.

13
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:37,050
God is also the major sponsor of sin.
Goku really?

14
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:42,051
So they've got no,
it's a store where you can buy 

15
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:45,330
everything from fashion to food to 
fucking sick like this.

16
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:48,180
And they sell these things called Tinga 
at similar to this,

17
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,460
but a bit smaller because the Japanese 
have really small cocks.

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,140
Sorry,
it's all about Japanese fans,

19
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:52,800
but you do.

20
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,670
And yet the guys buy these things,
tenders and they rip the leaves off.

21
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,400
Fuck him.
And well,

22
00:00:58,401 --> 00:00:59,370
uh,
this is,

23
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:04,371
uh,
this is the only sponsor I have for the 

24
00:01:04,371 --> 00:01:04,371
show.
Well,

25
00:01:04,371 --> 00:01:04,371
I've,
I've Kinda a couple other ones.

26
00:01:04,371 --> 00:01:04,371
But,
you know,

27
00:01:04,371 --> 00:01:06,540
in the MP three versions,
but this,

28
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:11,541
um,
this company was sponsored by a guy 

29
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:11,541
whose wife was pregnant and uh,
his,

30
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:14,200
he couldn't fuck her obviously,
so he invented something to funk,

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,560
came up with something to fuck and now 
he's rich.

32
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,400
I mean it's like his own personal.
Like they,

33
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:24,401
they,
they came up with all these patents for 

34
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:24,401
what makes it feel the most like a 
pussy.

35
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:28,010
It's really fantastic shit.
Like if you're feeling really fucking 

36
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:28,010
stick your cock in there.
No,

37
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:28,840
I didn't.
I wouldn't do that to you promise me the

38
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:31,320
one that fucking show longer.
You have not done that.

39
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,080
I would not do that to you.
I would only give you a clean one.

40
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,060
Oh,
you spit into fingertip.

41
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,470
Woo.
I feel dirty.

42
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,410
Am.
Yeah.

43
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,360
It's pretty,
pretty cool.

44
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:44,770
Well,
you know what I liked the most about it 

45
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:44,770
though,
that there's been a bunch of controversy

46
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:44,770
about it.
I think may have people called me.

47
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,920
Dude when he was doing.
He just got this.

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,100
I just got this last week.
May Have touched on.

49
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,900
I might have given them one.
I'll give you one if you want.

50
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:53,280
I got some extra.
That's right.

51
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:55,930
I got my girlfriend here once she got on
the road,

52
00:01:55,931 --> 00:02:00,931
then I know what you're saying is 
everything many times rather than 

53
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:02,130
blindly times on the road.
Cantaloupes in the microwave.

54
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,900
I only discovered like 12 months ago 
that the Japanese toilets all have a 

55
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,940
shoot water into your ass.
Right?

56
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,020
So Ivan,
what my ass in Japan for the last 10 

57
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,020
months because it shoots water in your 
house and cleans your house yet.

58
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,130
But that's really the way to do it.
So I had to go and uh,

59
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:18,210
warms a seat.
Warmers.

60
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:22,680
The seat tilts from side to side.
But if you shift back a little bit more,

61
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,660
it goes from your so shoots onto your 
bolts.

62
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,130
So the Japanese tourists can fumble your
balls,

63
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,790
you're lonely nights on the road and 
fondled and get the moisturizer.

64
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,960
So that's what you do from the bull 
senseless men on the road.

65
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,700
So I prepare for fight commentary.
How do you prepare?

66
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,410
Do you prepare it to like sit down with 
a,

67
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,810
you know,
almost everything there is to know about

68
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:44,070
all these guys that are fighting.
I mean,

69
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,080
you're,
the one thing that I appreciate about 

70
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,080
you is just like me,
like if you weren't doing this,

71
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,940
you'd still be watching it just as much 
still,

72
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:51,510
man.
Lucky.

73
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:52,270
I'm a fan.
You know,

74
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,630
he's over here tonight,
so we're going to watch strikeforce.

75
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,140
We're buddies.
We met in Edmonton and we hung out in 

76
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,190
Australia and now he's at my house and 
we're going to watch the fight tonight.

77
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,620
Yeah.
Yeah.

78
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,700
I can't.
The man I just don't feel a lot to do 

79
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:06,850
before I commentate is.
I'd just like to listen to music,

80
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:07,790
man,
a monopod,

81
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,000
listen to music.
I don't talk very much.

82
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:10,280
Like,
um,

83
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,880
last last year we draft a dynamite which
from the hotel to go to St Dahmer in 

84
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,560
Tokyo.
It's like a 50 minute drive and in the 

85
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,111
cab was like me and Irene and one of 
your producers and I said to both of 

86
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:26,071
them get you to talk to each other 
because I'm put these headphones on and 

87
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:28,981
just,
I don't talk to anyone who's fired up 

88
00:03:28,981 --> 00:03:28,981
on.
Yeah,

89
00:03:28,981 --> 00:03:30,940
just like to be in a good state of mind 
when you get a good state of mind.

90
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,480
I dude,
I play some cheesy us songs like,

91
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:36,010
seriously,
if you sold the 10 songs I play before I

92
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:37,740
go on in is cheesy.

93
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,160
I was like,
what do you do?

94
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,170
Not Get everything from the theme from 
Joe Esposito theme from karate kid you 

95
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,160
the best around,
right?

96
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,970
You know that one said like the theme 
from fucking grace,

97
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,040
like songs from the musical greats.
Really?

98
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,120
Yeah.
We achieved too excited for real.

99
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,120
I like the hand Jive,
the grease handjobs song.

100
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:02,030
Really do that hinge a baby that wasn't 
right.

101
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,010
I'm like,
cool.

102
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:05,770
I'm actually going there and come and 
take you on and dream.

103
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:08,200
I'm like hand jive.
That would drive me crazy.

104
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,090
Oh Man.
One man's poison.

105
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

106
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,700
I fucking love it.
That's it.

107
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,410
I just,
you know,

108
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,450
I'll make sure I'm well prepared.
I do in my research and all that sort of

109
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:18,010
shit.
But I know most of the guys anyway.

110
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,110
I like some bad music.
What do you like?

111
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,000
I like some country music.
That's terrible.

112
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,080
You really could have been a cowboy.
Like that song.

113
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:33,450
I liked some.
I liked some dumb toby keith style 

114
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:33,450
country music.

115
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,690
I like good country music too.
I liked like Hank Williams Jr.

116
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,760
I like that matt hughes song.
Country boy kenscI viola.

117
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,090
I fucking love that song.
That's a goddaMn man.

118
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,740
But now everyone is too gangsta.
Aaron is tHe end of the dialogue shit.

119
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,060
Some guys don't to see him.
I'm out fucking mama.

120
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:55,830
Papa.
Kathy's motherfuckers gangSter in rmb to

121
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,110
you sing.
You're a singer for living.

122
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:04,420
You know what would have happened to me 
if I told my dad when I was six years 

123
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:04,420
old,
daddy I want to be a singer.

124
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,820
He would have fuCking get out on the 
street.

125
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:09,710
Well they don't like to think of 
themselves as Being the,

126
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:12,010
that's a feminine thing.
So they overcompensate.

127
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,540
I sing for a fucKing.
He's not singing right?

128
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,000
Wrapping sort of wrapping.
It's just fast talking to shit.

129
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,420
This is shit talk like I hate everybody 
or a rhythm to it.

130
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,470
So it is kind of like musical,
but yeah.

131
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,650
But I like old r and b,
like I loVe marvin gaye.

132
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,440
Like that motherfucker just had a voice 
man.

133
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:34,960
But I don't like the new stuff because I
don't believe them.

134
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,470
That's what I'm saying.
Like r kelly,

135
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,040
I love art because it's funny man,
because it's so ridiculous.

136
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:46,070
You got unlucky urinating on my 
motherfucking.

137
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,920
He's saying that.
I mean these things is like a ghetto 

138
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,280
conversation and he just puts it to the 
song.

139
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,620
I could appreciate that.
But you know,

140
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,510
every second word is an ad.
It's like a bad word,

141
00:05:58,511 --> 00:06:00,020
a taboo word.
Like nigga,

142
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,820
you know,
we don't have that in Australia.

143
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,970
JusT quality one that there's many black
people in Australia,

144
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,480
but every sixth word doesn't even exist.
We wouldn't really know.

145
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,960
So it's like americans calling someone 
an abo,

146
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,770
aba,
aba,

147
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,610
aboriginal aboriginal ebo.

148
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,370
It doesn't exist over here.
When you call someone,

149
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,460
hey,
you fucking abok.

150
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:20,240
And they'll go,
okay,

151
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,230
what?
I'll call a black guy in american abok.

152
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:24,950
He goes,
that nigger is going to kill me.

153
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,980
But if you call an aborigine and abbo 
it's the same thing as call them and 

154
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,080
they'll pull picture on you and set you 
on fire.

155
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,440
But just a short version of aborigine.
Yeah,

156
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,560
you got to turn that shit off,
son.

157
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:38,720
Dismiss alarm.
I don't know why it sounded like five in

158
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:43,721
the afternoon.
Time to get your balls fall by the 

159
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:43,721
toilet.
You got that shit a clock.

160
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:43,721
You sick.
Fuck,

161
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,410
you're right.
It's,

162
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:45,710
it's,
it's an abbreviation.

163
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,260
It's like if you're jewish and I say 
you're a jew,

164
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,990
doesn't matter if that original ebo 
yeah,

165
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,650
italian.
I tie once I submit.

166
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:55,880
It's truly an ozzy.
Yeah.

167
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:58,080
What's wrong with that hyping called 
apo.

168
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,160
I made a statement once saying the japs 
have created some insane shit and this 

169
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,370
guy goes,
do you know how racist that is?

170
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:04,190
He just said that.
I'm like,

171
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,670
whAt we're talking about nsx is we're 
talking about engineering,

172
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:12,671
like japanese racecar engineering,
like they've invented some incredible 

173
00:07:12,671 --> 00:07:15,941
shit.
Their cars are so reliable and so I 

174
00:07:15,941 --> 00:07:18,191
said,
the japs have invented some incredible 

175
00:07:18,191 --> 00:07:18,191
shit.
This guy's like,

176
00:07:18,191 --> 00:07:18,191
do you know racist?
That is like,

177
00:07:18,191 --> 00:07:22,120
I had this argument last year with 
someone because I called someone a jack 

178
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,510
back home and it's lucky.
It's luck.

179
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,110
The world war two alliance thing that 
it's racist to call jack and I've got to

180
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:32,111
get past that silicon around japanese 
people for years and I'm sure have 

181
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:32,960
called them jepthah to the fights and I 
don't mind.

182
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,310
and in my mates like,
dude,

183
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:37,490
it's so fucking racist and it's wrong.
You can't cite japa baba.

184
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,620
so I went to Japan and I ask my 
producer.

185
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,160
I said,
dude,

186
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:41,950
if I call you a jap,
are you offended?

187
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:44,810
You guys know it's short for japanese.
We've got no offense.

188
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,200
You don't fucking start thinking pill 
harbor and you know,

189
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,590
we use the bombs on hiroshima and people
thought the nips was far too offensive.

190
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,000
JuSt that's how the japanese say,
Japan,

191
00:07:56,001 --> 00:08:01,001
they don't say Japan,
they say Nepal and some people are 

192
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:03,551
retarded.
It's a strange thing where people don't 

193
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:05,921
want to step on people's toes over 
nonsense like an abbreviation of a name 

194
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:09,461
is bad,
but hands is the only thing that's bad 

195
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:09,461
intent.
It's all in.

196
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:14,350
How do you feel like you need to say 
these jobs are fucking bad ass and make 

197
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,260
some cool shit?
Or do you take these japs,

198
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:20,350
these little tiny cock yellow 
motherfuckers coming over here to fuck 

199
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:20,840
all the white women and take all the 
land and you can start getting angry?

200
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,540
Well then jabs is a bad thing,
but that's the intent behind it.

201
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,730
That's bad to breathe the fucking nation
man nation.

202
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,320
so people are always looking for a 
reason to be pissed off.

203
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,750
People are so pissed off just about life
itself,

204
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:36,560
about traffic and bullshit and bills and
the constant midnight.

205
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,780
Everybody has a fuckIng opinion this 
day,

206
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:42,360
man.
Why can some people just shut up?

207
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,570
Let the fucking.

208
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,160
What qualifies you to have a fucking 
opinion that I should pay attention for?

209
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,470
Are you sitting behind your website 
fucking getting paid to put your opinion

210
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:56,170
on it?
No.

211
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,530
Well even the ones who are.
There's a lot of websites out there that

212
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:00,930
are.
There's a lot of bloggers,

213
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,060
in my opinion,
that aren't.

214
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,100
Aren't nearly as good as some of the 
commentary guys who post on like mixed 

215
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,611
martial arts.com.
There's some fucking intelligent guys 

216
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:11,490
that I've been reading their posts for 
years and if there.

217
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:13,920
I know that if there's a post about 
anything like serious,

218
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,700
well this guy,
if he posts soMething about it,

219
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:16,860
this is going to be an interesting 
opinion.

220
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:21,861
I want to read this,
but how many writers can you say that 

221
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:21,861
about?
I'm a writer.

222
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,340
I think there's more talented People on 
forums.

223
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,490
The other thing we him a might rod is is
they are blinded to anything outside of 

224
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,631
the ufc and I love the ufc because I'm a
fucking huge josh grosses.

225
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,860
Josh crushed pretty old brush.
One of the rare ones.

226
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,170
There's a few that aren't,
but a lot of them are blind to that.

227
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:38,940
He's not ufc.
They might be scared,

228
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:44,390
might be scared.
It's going to be yanKed their 

229
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:44,390
credentials from.
From,

230
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:44,390
from dana.
Dana,

231
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,950
dana.
I know it's creepy,

232
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,910
but a lot of them don't even know 
anything about marsh lots,

233
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:53,911
bro.
You could not sit down and have a 

234
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:53,911
conversation really about martial arts 
with them.

235
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:53,911
It's,
you know,

236
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:58,500
and dana is so competitive that he does 
have this environment where he feels 

237
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,040
like they should pay attention to the 
ufc first and then if they don't,

238
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,380
he's not very happy with that.
You'll see is the,

239
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,180
it's the promotion.
It is the one you go to a plantation,

240
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:14,310
that attitude in the pushing it like 
that as the reason why this fucking 

241
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,310
sports gigantic.
The reason why it's going Australia,

242
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,140
he's not lazy.
He's,

243
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:18,540
he's taken on all fronts,
you know,

244
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,090
so it's,
it's tough for journalists,

245
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,650
you know,
in the,

246
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,890
in that sense,
you know,

247
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,640
but theRe are soMe fucking talented guys
out there,

248
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,840
you know,
like josh gross is a talented 

249
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:31,840
journalist,
you know,

250
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:31,840
and he's,
he's honest aBout shed.

251
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,970
He's sometimes he's a little hyper 
critical,

252
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:37,140
but sometimes guys get like critical 
about dudes abilities and characters and

253
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:42,141
they try to say something bitchy because
if someone puts in a bad performance 

254
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:42,141
they'll just,
they feel like,

255
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:47,030
you know,
it's their job to be critical and to be 

256
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,030
shitty,
bitter,

257
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,570
bitter to fucking wrote about.
I did the keY perfect prison.

258
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,580
Perfect of.
But what do you say about like a cro cop

259
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:55,890
in amir fight when cro cop in me or 
fight man,

260
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,690
there's not a lot of positive things to 
say.

261
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,730
The positive thing to say is the end of 
the fight.

262
00:10:59,731 --> 00:11:04,731
Of course frank mir landed a perfect 
knee and put krakow away and then 

263
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:04,731
finished them,
you know,

264
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,450
jumped all over him.
So that's a good thing to say.

265
00:11:06,451 --> 00:11:09,150
But for everything up before that,
what cota writer say,

266
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,400
you know,
so they just start going off about,

267
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:16,430
you know,
the just the worst possible shit that 

268
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:16,430
they could think of.

269
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,150
You know,
what's wrong with frank mir and how,

270
00:11:17,151 --> 00:11:22,151
you know,
he's got this attitude and cro cop 

271
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:22,200
should hang it up and they'll just write
the most bitter fucked up shit.

272
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,380
You know,
I think that the human drama is far more

273
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:27,240
compelling.
The real drama of that fight,

274
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,550
you know?
So that was a strange fight,

275
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:34,170
man that fought the liked each other or 
something came out and he said,

276
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,200
even if I lose,
I'm not going to get cut from you have 

277
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,200
say.
So.

278
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,200
When I read that,
I'm like,

279
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,350
I don't want to fucking saY this.
Fully.

280
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,220
Say that.
He came out and said one of the websites

281
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:42,930
like medical essays.
Even if I lose,

282
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:44,340
I can't get cut.
well,

283
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:49,370
if that's the case,
I don't want to fucking watch that 

284
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:49,370
fight,
man.

285
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,741
Because already I know that.
I'm not sure if you've that give you a 

286
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:51,741
head.

287
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:54,710
I'm not sure if he really said that.
I these words maybe misconstrued very 

288
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,050
could be taken out of context.
If you lose this fight,

289
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:57,520
do you think you'll be kicked out of the
ufc?

290
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,980
I hope not.
Marco says he won't be kicked out of the

291
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:03,040
ufc if he loses his fight.
Journalism sometimes is that bad?

292
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,280
So misconstrued saved exactly what I 
supposedly said and I was like,

293
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,140
I didn't say it like that.
You know,

294
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,430
you're missing.
That has been the big difference,

295
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:17,431
bro.
Between commentatIng outside of America 

296
00:12:17,431 --> 00:12:17,890
and then recently coming onto the 
american scene.

297
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,160
It's like you could people that sit 
there and watch the broadcast and 

298
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,491
analyze every fucking word and pause and
breath you take and then dissect that 

299
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,950
down to the line.
It's bad and it's negative,

300
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:32,740
but I also think it's good for me 
personally.

301
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:33,640
It's good.
I've,

302
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,730
I've learned a lot from shitty people 
online saying shitty things because you 

303
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,690
know,
worst case scenario,

304
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:42,400
what can they attack you on?

305
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,510
Is there any validity in this total 
piece of shit was saying terrible things

306
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:51,511
about you,
but do they have a point and if they do 

307
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:52,930
have a point then you can like snatch 
victory from the older negative bullshit

308
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:57,931
by using and improving it and why if you
use a positively it x is a watch dog for

309
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:02,040
your own abilities and your appearances 
on her toe to total console.

310
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,350
I get personal freedom out of like 
reading the shittiest,

311
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:10,351
nastiest things that like I know just 
some desperate angry fuck has and 

312
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:14,761
turning it into a positive thing for me.
Like I have this little game that I 

313
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:14,761
played with because it's very dIfficult 
to do.

314
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:19,890
I want to do like solen bob and on the 
fuck is that when you read,

315
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:23,800
when you reached out to get mad?
I used to it man.

316
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,900
You know,
it's like as I.

317
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,590
I tend not to read a lot of it because 
it's was like,

318
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,710
what am I going to do?
Sit there and read it and go,

319
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:34,711
wow,
I'm so super and fantastic because 

320
00:13:34,711 --> 00:13:34,711
people are giving me these compliments 
and then you read people a little bag.

321
00:13:34,711 --> 00:13:39,410
Your wHy.
It's good to know that people are 

322
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,710
enjoying what you do need to know and to
connect with them and I saw you did that

323
00:13:41,711 --> 00:13:44,290
recently on the underground.
You made my first time on the.

324
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:44,980
On the ground.
Yeah,

325
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,610
there's plenty of cool people in there 
and I post on there all the time.

326
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:54,540
There's plenty of cool people there.
There's going to be douche bags no 

327
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:54,540
matter what.
When you have anonymous scream names and

328
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,951
people can say anything they want,
whenever you have that situation is 

329
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:01,120
going to be sure dog,
which has got some great posts,

330
00:14:01,121 --> 00:14:05,770
but also some really fucking ridiculous 
boo fuck is on there as well and so many

331
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:08,230
profiles that I know in so many media 
guys,

332
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:13,410
just one post on sites like that anymore
because of the reason that people just 

333
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,510
attack and attack like fucking puranas 
man.

334
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,050
This a lot of hateful fucks out there 
and I'm hateful for it's,

335
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,120
but it's a fascinating thing man,
because we're finally getting to see 

336
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,120
that.
Like everyone gets to see that noW.

337
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,090
It used to be,
you never got to see that.

338
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:26,260
If you were a star,
you know,

339
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:31,261
stars.
I think just 20 years ago we're were 

340
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:32,980
much more likely to be believing their 
own bullshit.

341
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:33,250
yeah.

342
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,240
Back then they never saw shit and if it 
gotten a magazine they approved it.

343
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:41,860
You know,
if I got a newspaper,

344
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:44,650
it had to be like big news,
like roman polanski type news to make it

345
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,330
in the newspaper.
But now man,

346
00:14:46,331 --> 00:14:48,370
they're all up in your shit everyday 
man.

347
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,470
Everything is just taken apart and 
dissect that.

348
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,900
Twitter,
I'm going to use the twitter with

349
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,990
twitter is not being in Australia,
dude to people in Australia who know 

350
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:56,990
about twitter?
No one twin is.

351
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,500
Everyone's on fucking facebook.
Oh,

352
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,730
nolan tweeters in Australia.
Some people are still stuck on my space.

353
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:03,890
Both twitter and facebook on mine are 
connected.

354
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,250
So if I said something on twitter,
it goes to facebook.

355
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,010
It says it there too.
So you lost soda,

356
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:14,020
nightmare technology.
Your house is like fucking nasser in 

357
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,020
here,
man.

358
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,620
Shit.
I'm a technology junkie.

359
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,690
Food.
Unbelievable.

360
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,130
Fascinated by what's going on with 
technology.

361
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:24,550
Seriously.
Leave any higher up on a fucking 

362
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,550
mountain over.
They.

363
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,040
When I was living in Colorado,
this bleed drying up here,

364
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,390
man.
this ain't shit.

365
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:29,090
This is civilization.
Compared to where I was living.

366
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:34,091
I was living.
I was living eight miles down a dirt 

367
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:34,160
road on the top of a mountain in 
boulder.

368
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,290
Fuck man.
That's why I like to live.

369
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:41,060
I like to live up and above so that when
like waves of water or waves,

370
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,760
retards,
neither waves of water,

371
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:46,040
a range of retards.
You see him coming up the hill.

372
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,610
I just don't.
I just like being away.

373
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,620
I think I'm very sensitive to people's 
energy and people's thoughts and their 

374
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,120
lives and their bullshit.
So I like to be as when I sleep and when

375
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,550
I'm at home and when I'm writing,
when I'm by myself,

376
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:00,530
I like to be as far away from people as 
possible.

377
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:01,120
I like,
man,

378
00:16:01,121 --> 00:16:03,510
it's cool because all the houses here at
different than all of the same.

379
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,840
Now the guided communities I've seen 
here in the states,

380
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,480
because we don't have gated communities 
in all the houses,

381
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:10,760
look the same though,
and up here they're all different and on

382
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,500
the guard gate is to.
God haS this to god's name.

383
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,930
Ralph once I'm judy,
I read the andreessen,

384
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,650
there's three of them,
two of them,

385
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,860
and I'm man.
Maybe it's a conspiracy rule,

386
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,860
man in the world,
like those coca cola inventors that they

387
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,620
had to be at least 50 feet apart from 
each other at all times.

388
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:35,621
You know?
It's like he never see to relevant what 

389
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:37,961
is in the sacred cola.
Inventors had to be 50 feet apart from 

390
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:37,961
each other.
never hear that.

391
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:38,000
Urban legend is a kid.
No.

392
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,880
Let the inventors of coca cola or the is
of kfc,

393
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:45,881
Kentucky fried chicken with the secret 
recipe that I carry around on them all 

394
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:48,050
the time.
Must at least be fIfty feet apart of one

395
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:48,770
of them dies.
The other ones,

396
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,720
one of them dies from the other one 
survives.

397
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,750
Wow.
Could you imagine if a recipe was that 

398
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:55,950
valuable?
The kfc secret spice.

399
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,940
Nothing will fuck up your appetite like 
watching.

400
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:04,880
One of those pita videos I love fucking 
children's urban legends.

401
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,400
Mandarin at scHool told you about about 
being a black belt.

402
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:12,401
When the kid sits me in grade five,
we'll talking about martial arts and 

403
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:15,761
he's like,
you can't be any more than it third dan 

404
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:18,071
black belt in Australia,
or you've got to get out of the country 

405
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,280
because you're then lethal weapon and 
have a license to kill.

406
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,190
I believed that for years,
man,

407
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,210
that I would probably believe it too.
Wow.

408
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,970
You just can't get to deadly.
I guess.

409
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:33,340
Speaking about urban legends,
do you get the same ones that we do 

410
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,911
here?
Did you guys get the richard gere jubal 

411
00:17:36,911 --> 00:17:36,911
room?
Oh,

412
00:17:36,911 --> 00:17:36,911
in the ass?
Yes.

413
00:17:36,911 --> 00:17:41,740
I didn't get that man because We didn't 
know what tables work because we call 

414
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,180
them a finger is what we call a Guinea 
pig and we have Guinea pigs.

415
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,840
Guinea pigs are much bigger though.
What's a job?

416
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,440
It's almost like.
Yeah,

417
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:49,370
it's like a mouse.
No,

418
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,340
people genuinely

419
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,980
stick up there.
If you look,

420
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:55,020
if you've thought of it,
someone's put it up their ass.

421
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,270
That's a fact,
and I knew about this.

422
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,480
I didn't want to know about this,
but I knew about my buddy steve graham,

423
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,660
who is a friend of mine from back when I
was like 15 years old and still still 

424
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,831
good friends.
He's a doctor and he did his residency 

425
00:18:09,831 --> 00:18:10,530
in miami and he said he got to see 
everything.

426
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:16,470
Tell me about gunshot wounds and 
everyday they'd be pulling some new 

427
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,470
thing out.
A dude's assets.

428
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,320
Becky melbourne,
a doctor friend of mine,

429
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,380
great doctor to go to dinner with 
[inaudible] you'll tell you are stories 

430
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,230
for hours.
He pulled a working dildo.

431
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:28,290
The dIldo was too long in a guy's colon.
It was large.

432
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:33,530
It went so fucking cry and he had some 
milk out of the guy's fucking colon and 

433
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:39,741
shoot it out of his ass and the deal 
that was still on some other guy in 

434
00:18:39,741 --> 00:18:41,160
there and had a fucking brim,
a fish up his ass.

435
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,740
Fuck breeam.
Appease off.

436
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,910
The thing that shocked my friend the 
most was glass and he said a lot of 

437
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,740
glass up there ass those bottles and 
jars and jars break and.

438
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,860
Oh no.
The freakiest one member dr told me was 

439
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,500
it wasn't about us,
was two gay guys that came to see him.

440
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,530
The one gay guy came to see him and he 
had problem with his cock is cockatiel 

441
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,470
this passing shit coming out of it.
So dr.

442
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,900
Nix had a look at.
He's cocky now.

443
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,910
He's gone.
I just don't know what I'm seeing here 

444
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:10,910
too.
It's like,

445
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,130
what have,
what have you been doing?

446
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:16,131
What would the reason for this be?
So the gay guy proceeded to tell him he 

447
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:16,131
thought,
well,

448
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:20,901
this might be the reason what him and 
his gay lover with doing that we're 

449
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:22,790
getting thin pieces of pipe thin pieces 
of piping like this theater,

450
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,210
long pipes.

451
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,630
He would sTick it into his urethra and 
then connect the other end who is gay 

452
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:33,891
lovers,
urethra and then they would piss piece 

453
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,690
between the rocks.
So he was pissing into his level,

454
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:42,691
his cock and his love of pc back into 
his car and he's gone into the doctor 

455
00:19:42,691 --> 00:19:46,090
saying my cox passover at why?
I thought the mix.

456
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,120
Like why the fuck do you thInk you were 
sharing your run with another human 

457
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,190
being?
With a metal through your deck,

458
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:58,270
it's rally the metal rod through the 
dick that fucked them up more than the 

459
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,010
path back and forth.
Pisses basically sterile.

460
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,150
Oh,
and what was the other.

461
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,460
Oh,
the other sport he told me and that this

462
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:05,010
fat chick that came in one day like mega
fat,

463
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:06,960
like you know what's eating gilbert 
grape?

464
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:08,700
That fucking big fat.
Five hundred pounds.

465
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,380
What do you guys use?
Kilos.

466
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,100
Kilos.

467
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,340
Kyla.
So she'd be like 180 kilos bono side.

468
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,920
Five hundred pounds.
Sounds better though.

469
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,330
Five hundred pounds.
That's like yuck.

470
00:20:18,331 --> 00:20:23,331
As unit size.
Cool kilos are just too big and you 

471
00:20:23,331 --> 00:20:26,270
listen to this fucking gargantuan 
behemoth comes in and she came in and 

472
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:28,530
she'd stuck a tampon to fire up her 
pussy.

473
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,680
She asked doctor need to get it out.
So we had to give up the pliers,

474
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:34,500
the tongues and go into the skills 
fucking kevin,

475
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,920
right as she got through all the 
fentanyl thighs and pull out a tampon.

476
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,180
She came back the next month with the 
same problem and she was coming back for

477
00:20:42,181 --> 00:20:44,400
four months in a row with the same 
problem.

478
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:47,770
Sticking your tampon to far per month to
be able to pull it out.

479
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,680
So eventually dr nick realize that when 
he was,

480
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:56,310
because he'd never looked her in the 
face because you're not really pulling 

481
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,370
shit out of her tampon this time he,
he had,

482
00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:00,190
he had an inkling just like his stick 
and tongues up her pussy.

483
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,400
And because this is a fucking animal,
fucking beached whale,

484
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:06,460
no one's ever going to touch her vet 
includes probably never been touched.

485
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:08,620
And so that felt good to her.
So for her,

486
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,970
he's going inside.
She was like,

487
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,960
oh,
like that.

488
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,330
Oh my gosh,
here realizes,

489
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,920
realizes she's not coming campano up her
pussy so that he'll go get them.

490
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,780
So he would go fishing there and get the
tampons.

491
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:25,910
For a girl like that,
that shouldn't be a place where you go 

492
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:25,910
guys are just finger you.
I'm all for that.

493
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:30,661
You know,
when I talk about being for 

494
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:30,661
prostitution,
um,

495
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:30,661
I'm all for um,
for dudes doing it too.

496
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:33,820
I'm for jude's eaton girls put susan 
finger and I'm sure it gets me that bro.

497
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,910
I never understood what the big deal is 
about getting a hand job.

498
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,990
you know,
you get on with it though.

499
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:44,220
It's way more of a big deal for girl.
What I'm saying for girls is that would 

500
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,761
be a sweet spot for them,
like a store where they could see your 

501
00:21:47,761 --> 00:21:50,860
fingers and our hands can go through and
just saying that you don't have to go 

502
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,320
out with some dude just because you need
sex.

503
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,490
You can just fucking,
you know,

504
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:58,510
you'd Be all right.
We can get it when you really want to 

505
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:58,720
get Into a relationship behind 
sterilized hand,

506
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,480
a little bit of touro stimulation.
During your lunch break,

507
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,110
10 minutes.
Listerine kills all the germs.

508
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:08,320
Every time you get back to a high 
powered afternoon in the office,

509
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,400
I mean,
come on,

510
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,340
look that guy eat your box and just 
fingeR back.

511
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,320
You'll feel so much better.
So we doing.

512
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,620
He retires from u of c commentary.
No,

513
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,070
the world's first chain of self 
fingering seller.

514
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,700
We need more progress in this world 
Before the world.

515
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:28,480
Ready to accept my idea sir.
True finger banging stations.

516
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,780
The hole in the wall with god's 
goodness.

517
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,510
Go stick their junk in a fucking glory 
hole and get tossed off by some chick on

518
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:35,980
the other side of the whole.
Yeah.

519
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:39,740
What I suggested was frustration.
It would be like a,

520
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:44,741
uh,
like one of those thIngs where you do 

521
00:22:44,741 --> 00:22:44,741
confession.
One of those,

522
00:22:44,741 --> 00:22:44,741
those,
those,

523
00:22:44,741 --> 00:22:46,870
uh,
the professional,

524
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:51,910
is that what it's called?
And he's like going inside the 

525
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:51,910
professionalized.
They kneel on a pew.

526
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,140
Okay.
So you're in this little phone book 

527
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,001
type,
phone booth type situation and you have 

528
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,731
a Monitor in front of you.
You can watch some porn and she just 

529
00:22:59,731 --> 00:22:59,731
sticks her hand through a hole in the 
wall.

530
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:02,260
Even better,
you can able to watch the monitor of the

531
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:05,800
girl on the other side checkinG you off.
Yeah.

532
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,970
But what if she's gross?
Like,

533
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:08,200
you shouldn't even have to be good 
looking.

534
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,070
This one,
it's true.

535
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,580
I'Ll just do,
is just be good at and dudes off away.

536
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,540
You don't have to see her franchise 
coming.

537
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,870
The house of handoffs handjobs and don't
even get to see what's happening below 

538
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:23,581
your waist.
He's a trained professional to 10 

539
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:23,581
minutes here,
right?

540
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:24,130
The tension's gone.
The stress has gone.

541
00:23:24,131 --> 00:23:29,131
And you just ready for free for the day.
We can't handle that shit here in 

542
00:23:29,131 --> 00:23:29,170
America.
And we're a bunch of pussies.

543
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,180
Yeah,
we don't.

544
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,360
We don't want it.
We don't want it.

545
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:33,040
We want.
We want people to be repressed.

546
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:38,041
We want people to just be nonsexual.
And we want people to be a slave to 

547
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,780
whatever relationship they're in to 
americans have super paranoid,

548
00:23:40,781 --> 00:23:45,781
man.
If I was living here and watching your 

549
00:23:45,781 --> 00:23:46,610
news every night,
I would fucking be so look out my window

550
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:51,730
in the United States of America.
You are right now in the balls of the 

551
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:52,700
dick.
That's fucking the world.

552
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,160
All right.
This is a crazy ass place to live.

553
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,200
It is fucked,
man.

554
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,500
It's fucked.
Paranoid people hear stuff far too much.

555
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,810
It's crazy,
man.

556
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,520
You ever watch us?
Do you watch fox news?

557
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,590
This is the worst.
Rupert murdoch.

558
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,560
I watch fox news.
just go,

559
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,200
what the fuck are you talking?
There's too much.

560
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,550
Everyone is.
I mean it's.

561
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:24,551
And you know,
it's a self fulfilling prophecy to like 

562
00:24:24,551 --> 00:24:24,551
they,
they,

563
00:24:24,551 --> 00:24:26,750
they literally manifest their own war 
against the liberals.

564
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,760
And d was on fox news.
It was that whole thing about when bush 

565
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,171
was voted in for the first time and fox 
news did something about the voting 

566
00:24:35,171 --> 00:24:37,520
polls.
You know when bush big gore and goal was

567
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:38,790
actually the guy that won,
wanted the brush,

568
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:43,791
got ian and fox news had something to do
with the way that they told voters that 

569
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:47,500
push it already won,
but some votes somewhere hadn't been 

570
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,590
done or works here in America,
but nobody knows how it works.

571
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,300
Write something aBout It,
man.

572
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,620
Type 30 credits something about do you 
want to be spokes?

573
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,770
You know what I love?
I love when one,

574
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,620
when politicians get busted for 
something sexual,

575
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,670
anything deviant,
anything.

576
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:03,670
Sexual fox always makes them a democrat.
It's a long running joke.

577
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:08,210
It's a long running job,
but if there's some guy he gets caught,

578
00:25:08,211 --> 00:25:10,580
you know,
fucking his babysitter or something like

579
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:13,880
that to bam di di repo,
Vermont,

580
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:14,590
you know it's,
oh,

581
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,490
they always.
Even if the guy's a republican,

582
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:20,720
he always write them down as a democrat 
politician that the sexual stuff you get

583
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:25,721
caught for should just be the most 
dirtiest fucking disgusting deprived 

584
00:25:25,721 --> 00:25:27,980
shit ever.
You're going to go down as a politician,

585
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,550
go down fucking inflames,
man.

586
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,270
Some deprIve ship.

587
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:33,020
Dc man?
Um,

588
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:38,021
do you know that story?
There's a dc madam who was running some 

589
00:25:38,021 --> 00:25:41,051
chain in Washington dc and uh,
she had all these high powered senators 

590
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,910
and congressmen,
all these people on her,

591
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:46,070
on her,
on her list of,

592
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:51,110
you know,
john's and she was going to release it 

593
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,460
and there was some fucking crazy 
attention.

594
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,520
She gave him,
you know,

595
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,780
press conferences and the whole deal.
And then she committed suicide.

596
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,160
Just conveniently committed suicide,
committed suicide.

597
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:06,260
No one said a fucking day.
No one said a thing.

598
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:07,850
No one was like,
wait a minute,

599
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,500
hold on,
wait a minute.

600
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,680
You're telling me that this woman right 
now getting more attention than ever 

601
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,850
possibly set to make a million dollars.
She's deciding to hang herself.

602
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,010
Really?
Because I could just pinch your legacy.

603
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:20,330
I don't know.
Every politician that booklet,

604
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,770
40 of them just caught slipping her at 
google.

605
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,930
WhaT?
What they did to her or what?

606
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:27,610
Which he supposedly did.
Definitely go see they killed her.

607
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,120
They killed her ass.
My favorite one was there was a story 

608
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,861
about one of the enron whistleblowers 
who committed suicide by shooting 

609
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:38,420
himself in the head twice.
I'm not kidding.

610
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,210
I'm not kidding.
He shot himself in the head twice.

611
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,980
I wish I could remember the,
the full details of

612
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,980
thIs story,
but the that's the coroner's report was 

613
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:48,980
that he shot himself,
which I guess is possible.

614
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,750
You could shoot yourself in the head in 
a fucked up and you're still alive,

615
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:54,960
but your,
your fight clubs and you know that you,

616
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,350
they didn't remember it.
Dalton's character like blew off hafiz.

617
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,500
Yeah.
I got bored with that movie once I found

618
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:03,450
out who was two different guys.
I was Like,

619
00:27:03,451 --> 00:27:04,350
wait a minute.
What?

620
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,960
You just faking it now?
So this guy wasn't even real.

621
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:10,650
Wait,
wait a minute.

622
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:14,060
What the fucK that I watch then dude,
would you rather watch that or parana?

623
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:19,380
Pronto was pretty darn.
It was cocky as fuck.

624
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:26,390
But if you're in the mood for the 
chicken to face ripped off the 

625
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,360
propeller.
It was cool.

626
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,910
That was nasty.
Fuck man.

627
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,030
There was totally ridiculous though.
Most ridiculous.

628
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:35,870
Will we ever fucking.
I liked jerry o'connell,

629
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,050
gIrls kind of wild.

630
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,950
Oh,
awesome.

631
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:39,180
Right.
That was pretty cool.

632
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:42,360
I mean,
if there's anybody that you can root for

633
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:44,850
getting their dickie.
Jerry o'connell,

634
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,400
I still liked him from stand by me.
No,

635
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,300
not him.
You know,

636
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,340
I'm saying that girls gone wild.
Guy goes,

637
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,000
yeah,
yeah,

638
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,010
yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

639
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:56,050
Play the character.
I was watching hd net the other night 

640
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:56,050
and uh,
uh,

641
00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:00,890
some dirty shit and I understand that 
man kind of wild thing and I was 

642
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:04,080
watching that girls kind wild guy,
like hanging out with those girls.

643
00:28:04,081 --> 00:28:09,081
I'm like,
that would be the saddest thing ever if 

644
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,910
that was your daughter,
if your daughter was hanging around with

645
00:28:11,911 --> 00:28:12,750
that dude.
You're like,

646
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,110
oh shit,
are you watching this?

647
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,610
You see what's going on?
This guy really,

648
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:26,180
he's even creepier to me than hafter.
There's something super creepy about 

649
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:26,180
that.
She often made hefner,

650
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,400
I would love to get to the playboy 
mansion.

651
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,610
That man,
I'm not that big a deal.

652
00:28:29,611 --> 00:28:31,620
It's just a house in the hills.
It's like,

653
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,240
it's kind of like dated,
you know?

654
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:34,530
I mean,
I guess it's like retro,

655
00:28:34,531 --> 00:28:37,170
but the grotto has like this old circuit
box,

656
00:28:37,171 --> 00:28:39,120
this old phone.
It's a dope house.

657
00:28:39,121 --> 00:28:41,520
it's a beautiful piece of land and I'm 
not saying,

658
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,260
I'm just saying when you get there 
you're like,

659
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:48,290
oh,
well let's just kind of a cool house in 

660
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,271
the hills.
It's just one of those things where 

661
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:50,580
everybody likes to put parties there and
so that's what they kind of sell it as.

662
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,040
Right.
Force has done it.

663
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:58,041
I've been to.
I've not had one a few weeks ago that 

664
00:28:58,041 --> 00:28:58,041
was relaxing and boxy.
Cassandra simon from h.

665
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:01,020
Then it went to the well in that way 
it's kind of a cool place to go,

666
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,520
you know,
to go see something there.

667
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:03,240
Yeah,
it's kind of a cool.

668
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,210
But I've been at parties there before 
they get.

669
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:10,290
I guess they get crazy.
That's what tomorrow I got to New York 

670
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,540
for the first time.
I'd never been to New York all the times

671
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,320
I've been here to the us.
I've never been to New York.

672
00:29:13,321 --> 00:29:18,321
So tomorrow we're getting the death star
five nights when you drive up the west 

673
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:18,321
side highway and,
and,

674
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:22,781
and you just see the enormity of the 
city as it starts to rise in front of 

675
00:29:22,781 --> 00:29:26,480
you.
Play star wars music while you're doing 

676
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:26,480
that for real.
Really ask,

677
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,590
ask if you could drive in on the west 
side highway if that's possible and 

678
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:30,590
asked,
you know,

679
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:35,420
if you could play the star wars music.
Just a tough time.

680
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:42,220
The first time I drove there from boston
I couldn't fucking believe how big it 

681
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,270
was.
The first time was in the citY.

682
00:29:43,271 --> 00:29:44,380
I was,
well I went twice.

683
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:49,381
I went once for a karate tournament in 
madison square garden back in like 1982 

684
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:49,930
or something.

685
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,260
Yeah,

686
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,550
yeah,
there was a tournament there.

687
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,050
Yeah.
And then there was,

688
00:29:56,051 --> 00:29:57,510
I think it might've been,
I don't know if it was,

689
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,190
there's two parts of the gardens is a 
smaller part in the bigger part.

690
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:02,570
I don't know how much they,
how much space they had.

691
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,210
I was young,
I barely remember it,

692
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,910
but when I came back to do as a standup,
I was,

693
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:07,240
you know,

694
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:13,010
no much more aware of what was going on 
and when I drove up I drove up the west 

695
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,610
side highway and saw it for the first 
time.

696
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,220
I remember going,
damn,

697
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:20,190
how fucking big is this?
Like why did they keep building here?

698
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:22,130
If you been to tokyo know you haven't 
been yet.

699
00:30:22,131 --> 00:30:26,090
Now I'm going to come with me to k one 
and when you say it is fucking insight,

700
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:31,091
it's last sort of sidekick and drive for
40 minutes or an hour and it's still 

701
00:30:31,091 --> 00:30:33,950
built up.
Skyscrapers they never fucking in.

702
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,220
You look out your window and all tHe way
to the fucking horizon.

703
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,150
All you see is concrete.
It is fucking that.

704
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,780
Is it bigger than New York?
I think it's be a land wise.

705
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:50,220
Well there's 30 million people in 30 
million of the fuckers in tai chi man 

706
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:53,420
and still nobody jaywalks can you 
imagine?

707
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:58,690
You've got shavaya crossing the busiest 
crossing in the world and fucking 

708
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,050
thousands upon thousands of people.

709
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,600
But In Japan,
no one jay walks.

710
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:07,780
I'd been walking at 4:00
in the morning when I'm jet lagged for 

711
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:07,850
4:30
in the morning.

712
00:31:07,851 --> 00:31:12,851
There's not a car in sight for fucking 
miles and I'll be standing next to a 

713
00:31:12,851 --> 00:31:16,640
businessman and he still will not 
jaywalk 4:30

714
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:21,641
in the morning.
We'll wait for the little man to turn 

715
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:24,161
green.
Why is that the fucking weird luck 

716
00:31:24,161 --> 00:31:26,000
zombies over there.
Everything is regimented on the streets.

717
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:31,150
No one screamed.
No one swears no one because their 

718
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:31,670
horns.
There's no graffiti.

719
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,440
Everyone's small.
So each other.

720
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,570
Everyone is good.
Yes to each other.

721
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:40,280
It is like a fucking mind boggling,
overly polite utopia.

722
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:42,980
If you're into that sort of thing.
If you could speak english,

723
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,100
it'd be.
It'd be amazing if they spoke english.

724
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:50,570
It is an insane real is insane at the 
fight shows you've seen the fight to you

725
00:31:50,571 --> 00:31:51,860
here.
Super drop.

726
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,470
You can hear a pin drop steve.
Thousand people.

727
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,690
40th 5,000
of dynamite last year.

728
00:31:56,691 --> 00:32:01,691
We used to do it for k one and still 
they appreciate moves and get golf clap.

729
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,070
You know,
you get a fucking golf clap.

730
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:07,460
It's.
It's an amazing culture.

731
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:09,430
Amanda.
The tokyo experience.

732
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,900
I want you to come with me one day and 
your fucking why would love it

733
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,270
to,
to go see k one.

734
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:15,670
I've always wanted to see a k,
one grand prix live.

735
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,990
I've always want to see that.
Yeah.

736
00:32:16,991 --> 00:32:21,991
It's got to be.
I'm a big fan of it and that's one of 

737
00:32:21,991 --> 00:32:21,991
the reasons why I love hd net fights,
you know,

738
00:32:21,991 --> 00:32:23,390
it's like fuck,
you know,

739
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,400
finally,
you know,

740
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:29,401
may have,
and I were talking about it when we did 

741
00:32:29,401 --> 00:32:31,260
inside mma.
I sold that with the cuban cuban on 

742
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:31,260
that.
Oh,

743
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,140
it was great.
We were talking about how it used to be.

744
00:32:32,141 --> 00:32:37,141
If you wanted to watch k one,
you had to get these fucking grainy vhs 

745
00:32:37,141 --> 00:32:39,350
tapes or get some shit off the internet,
but now you can watch it and high def,

746
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,060
you know,
it's fucking awesome.

747
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:41,600
Carrie,
what you.

748
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,460
Some of the people don't know how 
exciting that is,

749
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:48,490
who don't know k one because most of 
what people like in the ufc is striking.

750
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:52,160
That's what the average person like 
striking people,

751
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:54,170
boo when shit goes to the ground happens
all the time.

752
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,410
For those people that are just like,
they just want to watch some violence,

753
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,780
what the fuck is more violent in k one 
and what?

754
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,970
Who the fuck is more volume than 
alistair overeem?

755
00:33:01,971 --> 00:33:04,410
Man,
fucking carry.

756
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,130
Somebody in cracked,
cracked.com

757
00:33:07,131 --> 00:33:12,131
wrote that.
He looks like he was genetically 

758
00:33:12,131 --> 00:33:13,190
engineered to fuck your girlfriend.
I'm pretty sure it was cracked.com.

759
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:18,191
I hope I'm crediting the right people.
that's exactly what it looks to these 

760
00:33:18,191 --> 00:33:21,761
fucking frigging.
WhIch leads me to the question now 

761
00:33:21,761 --> 00:33:23,831
because when we spoke last time on the 
voice versus the whole rage then was 

762
00:33:23,831 --> 00:33:27,320
fetal versus brock and we spoke a lot 
about final versus broken and you know,

763
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:31,190
I have to fight all these.
That fights lost its luster completely.

764
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:34,160
So now everyone is like overeem versus 
brock.

765
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,570
Yeah.
Over.

766
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,840
I want to see overeem versus fate or 
two.

767
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,450
I want to say that alice said once that 
fight badly,

768
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:46,660
like he is all over.
We did the voice versus alistair 

769
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,460
overeem.
We shuttered in Korea and um,

770
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,700
man,
he really wants to fight.

771
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,470
Find out.
Here's the thing with alistair overeem,

772
00:33:51,471 --> 00:33:54,830
you gotta fucking take him down.
There's all that talk of standing.

773
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:58,010
There's all out the window now.
It used to be the guys can stand without

774
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,080
alastar.
Like chuck stood with him for a bit.

775
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,970
Chuck actually shot in for a take down 
with them.

776
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:07,270
You know the problem with dallin starr 
was always that he was trying to make 

777
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:07,270
two.
Oh five.

778
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,470
Yeah,
that was always the problem and he 

779
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:11,981
wasn't dedicated like he is now,
but once I motherfucker went up to 

780
00:34:11,981 --> 00:34:11,981
heavyweight and started getting 
dedicated.

781
00:34:11,981 --> 00:34:16,390
he's,
he's scariest thing is like last week 

782
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,120
and he knocked out ben edwards had bins 
in nausea and I've been commentating him

783
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:19,390
for like six overcoming tough,
tough,

784
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:20,960
tough,
tough guy.

785
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:25,190
Ellis did dropped him three times But 
three clean shots.

786
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:30,191
And the thing is that usually lsj would 
get away with a lot because of his 

787
00:34:30,191 --> 00:34:34,151
strength any size alone,
but now he's technique is just superb 

788
00:34:34,151 --> 00:34:36,200
man.
And know he was training in Thailand for

789
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:41,201
like three weeks at the golden glory gym
in Thailand doing proper muay thai 

790
00:34:41,201 --> 00:34:41,630
training.
The thai trainers there,

791
00:34:41,631 --> 00:34:46,631
helping them out and you can tell that 
he's just lifted his game to another 

792
00:34:46,631 --> 00:34:46,940
fucking liberal too.
He's,

793
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:48,860
he's spooky right now.
Spooky.

794
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,060
His standup.
A spooky,

795
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,480
you know,
I love the fact that he goes back and 

796
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,981
forth though.
I love the fact that he goes into mma 

797
00:34:56,981 --> 00:34:59,201
and respect back and forth.
The only god doing it at that high 

798
00:34:59,201 --> 00:34:59,201
level,
no one else of course.

799
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,560
Level for sure.
not even,

800
00:35:00,561 --> 00:35:01,430
no,
no question.

801
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:05,060
There's no one even compares to the 
level of k one that he's achieved.

802
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,500
And the level of mma,
I mean,

803
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,850
because we've always had guys who say 
like,

804
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,540
oh,
he's a real,

805
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:10,730
he's a really good striker and you know,
they are for,

806
00:35:10,731 --> 00:35:15,731
for mma,
but als stars are really good striker 

807
00:35:15,731 --> 00:35:15,731
for key.
Exactly.

808
00:35:15,731 --> 00:35:18,110
But who can adjust to mma striking,
which is very impressive man,

809
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:19,220
because you know,
the distancing,

810
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,400
the footwork is all completely different
from mma structure.

811
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:27,450
TaIwan striking.
So to swing between them at the two 

812
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:27,450
highest levels is,
is,

813
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:27,950
is an insane,
uh,

814
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,840
treated.
When he put it to brett rogers.

815
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:30,950
I was like,
god,

816
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,530
he fucking threw him.
It was,

817
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,400
it was what it was before he threw him.
He was fucking up on his feet.

818
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,580
He hit brett rogers with.
He ducked under a right hand.

819
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:46,581
I hit him with a leg kick and then 
popped out of the way and you could see 

820
00:35:46,581 --> 00:35:46,581
the look on roger's face.

821
00:35:46,581 --> 00:35:48,610
He was like,
there was a job.

822
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,790
am I doing here?
It was a jolt to like,

823
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,050
oh shit.
Like,

824
00:35:52,051 --> 00:35:54,330
you know,
nobody ever kicked him like that before.

825
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,500
To me it was just luck.
You know,

826
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,520
I'll just bend over to get fucked in the
ass because it's going to be less 

827
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:00,520
painful than the beating you're about to
die.

828
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,670
Motherfucker.
Dave's that shin into that meet bob baum

829
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,680
and there was that,
that look on roger's facebook site for a

830
00:36:07,681 --> 00:36:09,250
second.
You saw this fLashlight.

831
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,730
God damn.
He just got hit by lightning.

832
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,680
Fuck lss.
Bit.

833
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:19,070
I'd be cleaNs up on the.
That's a big problem to me that there's 

834
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,800
all these organizations.
If there was just a ufc,

835
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:24,900
we will know who is.
But alastar would not have gotten to 

836
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,480
become our star if it wasn't for 
fighting all these other organizations.

837
00:36:27,481 --> 00:36:32,481
you know?
I mean there's not enough fights in the 

838
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:32,481
ufc.

839
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:32,490
There's not enough.
There's not enough shows.

840
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,720
There's,
there's only so many shows.

841
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:38,721
Like we need other organizations,
but I just wish they could fucking just 

842
00:36:38,721 --> 00:36:40,530
figure out a way to work it out where 
they get to fight each other.

843
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:43,000
We'll come together as friends for one 
night for one night.

844
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:48,230
The problem is,
and then maybe you and I could come and 

845
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,230
take together.
Finally,

846
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,230
for one,
it would have to be.

847
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:52,940
The problem is the ufc is such a much 
bigger name and there were so much more 

848
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,631
money.
in the end it would lend respectAbility 

849
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:56,631
to forest,
which is like build up the enemy.

850
00:36:56,631 --> 00:37:01,191
Like you can't.
You couldn't really do it unfortunately 

851
00:37:01,191 --> 00:37:03,730
business wise.
But fuck brock brock is like the perfect

852
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:08,560
guy to like sell as like a heavyweight 
champion.

853
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:13,670
Fucking the fucking worried.
You think brock fighting alistair and 

854
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:16,250
the way that he turned on those punches 
from cowan.

855
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,190
Oh my god.
What if.

856
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,600
Yeah,
if that was alistair.

857
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:21,060
And how about those knees?
No one's got nice.

858
00:37:21,061 --> 00:37:25,490
Like alastar alastar knees you into 
fucking the one he fucked fuJita ethan,

859
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:30,500
you put fujita into a coma.
He was out for how long?

860
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,640
He was fucking out for 10 minutes at 
least.

861
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:36,060
Then they took him to the hospital and 
he went into a coma at hospital.

862
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,820
He was fucked and ellis has said to me,
because I said to him,

863
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:39,240
I go,
dude,

864
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:44,241
do you ever feel any remorse for just 
fucking smashing people's faces and 

865
00:37:44,281 --> 00:37:46,260
brains and with those needs?
And he goes,

866
00:37:46,261 --> 00:37:46,800
yeah.
He goes,

867
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:47,940
for gita.
He goes,

868
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:50,100
I actually felt really bad after I did 
it.

869
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:55,590
I don't know what about to share a man.
You almost killed that fucker in the 

870
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:55,590
grand prix.
Awful.

871
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:55,790
Tisha was dead.
He's like,

872
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:56,340
he had to share.

873
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,030
It was harsh.
She goes,

874
00:37:57,031 --> 00:37:59,790
but fujita,
he actually was troubled by it.

875
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:01,230
He felt really sorry.
Well,

876
00:38:01,231 --> 00:38:06,231
I think it was cause for geeta had 
already been knocked out and been 

877
00:38:06,231 --> 00:38:06,730
stopped a few times.
He was old.

878
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:11,780
It was a legend and man that was body 
clearly didn't look the same anymore.

879
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:14,690
He didn't look like an athlete anymore.
I was just fucking violent.

880
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:18,030
And yet for James Thompson in dream 
standing guillotine,

881
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,290
he just say the muscles in his back.
Well,

882
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:22,770
he's fucking beautiful,
man.

883
00:38:22,771 --> 00:38:25,530
He tapped.
Detour can also tap veto with,

884
00:38:25,531 --> 00:38:26,160
uh,
getting,

885
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:27,340
you know,
freaking out.

886
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:30,300
Stars nasty bro.
He's an ass fucking nasty.

887
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:33,420
You know what brock lesnar versus 
alastar would be a dream match,

888
00:38:33,421 --> 00:38:38,080
but bronx got to get past cain velasquez
is right for,

889
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,550
I wouldn't call it an upset site is 
right for an upset,

890
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:44,680
but I don't call it an upset if cane 
beets broccoli,

891
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,480
because cane has all the weapons to be 
able to beat brockman chain might be the

892
00:38:49,481 --> 00:38:50,170
motherfucker.

893
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,070
He might be the motherfucker,
you know,

894
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,510
I think brock is a,
is a handful for any man on the planet.

895
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,170
he proved in that last fight that he's 
got like a series of ability to overcome

896
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:00,100
adversity and,
and,

897
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,600
and still,
you know,

898
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:04,270
like gutted out and make it through.
He didn't tap,

899
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,480
he didn't freak out,
you know,

900
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,480
he covered himself.
I'll,

901
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,800
you're protecting himself and he was 
getting bombed on,

902
00:39:08,801 --> 00:39:10,270
but you know,
other than him,

903
00:39:10,271 --> 00:39:12,760
the biggest,
strongest fucking guy in the division,

904
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,910
you know,
it was definitely the best punch her in 

905
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:17,910
the division and no one punches his 
heart as carla and comedy.

906
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:18,730
He's got wrecking balls,
you know,

907
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,580
he just dropped bumps.
So he got through all that,

908
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,640
made it through that first round and 
then came out and won it immediately 

909
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:26,640
into the second.
So he's,

910
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,970
he's overcome adversity.
He believes in himself.

911
00:39:27,971 --> 00:39:29,200
He's a winner.
That's all.

912
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:31,150
Well and good though.
Cain velasquez,

913
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:32,660
he's a fucking storm that,
you know,

914
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,410
here's something that bob cook said they
were,

915
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:40,411
uh,
they were talking about one of the 

916
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:40,411
fights.
That candidate just fucking,

917
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:41,200
I think it was rothwell just ran them 
over,

918
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,510
you know.
And uh,

919
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,500
he said,
uh,

920
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,350
well,
you know,

921
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,560
the thing with fight and cain is you 
always think that you're just going to 

922
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:49,900
ride out the storm.
And he goes,

923
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,010
put the storm doesn't end.

924
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,970
That is what that guy does.
We had a storm.

925
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:01,990
Doesn't end it,
just punches and kicks and punches and 

926
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:01,990
kicks and fucking takedowns punches and 
kicks and punches,

927
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,800
kicks.
And you're like,

928
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:05,200
where is this motherfucker getting All 
this cardio from?

929
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,550
Does it all with power,
man,

930
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:11,551
that's the scary thing.
It's fucking we've pal and he doesn't 

931
00:40:11,551 --> 00:40:11,551
fade.
He doesn't fade.

932
00:40:11,551 --> 00:40:15,931
He comes out strong.
and the third when he molested check 

933
00:40:15,931 --> 00:40:16,930
Congo and that's what that match was.
That was three round molestation.

934
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:20,950
I mean he took bombs,
bombed big shots on the jaw,

935
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,790
knees buckle almost goes down and then 
three seconds later he's executed.

936
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:28,300
The take down is inside control and he's
smashing them,

937
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,250
you know?
I mean that was just like,

938
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,280
that was overwhelming.
It was overwhelming what he did to that 

939
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,770
guy.
Motherfucker.

940
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,210
Dude,
I count my for that.

941
00:40:37,211 --> 00:40:38,770
I'll come back and say tito,
come back in.

942
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,120
Know I'm looking forward to that as 
well.

943
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,900
Um,
but may have brock.

944
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,770
Brockton high was going to be nuts.
Are broken cane.

945
00:40:44,771 --> 00:40:49,771
And then man,
I want to say Alice Davis has broke one 

946
00:40:49,771 --> 00:40:49,771
day.
Course tickets.

947
00:40:49,771 --> 00:40:53,130
I want to see yellow star.
I mean I would like to see alastar 

948
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:53,130
cleanout strikeforce to.
I would like.

949
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:53,890
I think if alastar can beat,
reduce,

950
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,920
that would be a huge rematch.
I don't think there's anyone his truck 

951
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:58,920
force,
honestly.

952
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:58,920
It'll touch him.
Well,

953
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,780
what gets them on the ground?
I bet for doom it has a say in that.

954
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:04,570
I bet he would try to tap our star.
I bet he thinks he can.

955
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:05,440
And he did.
You know he's,

956
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,120
he's capable of doing it.
Didn't he do it before?

957
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:08,560
Didn't you tap out star?
He did,

958
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:09,760
but like what?
Pride.

959
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:12,880
Two thousand and seven.
That's true.

960
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,780
But guess what?

961
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:16,900
Different volume to value we're doing 
just getting off of that.

962
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,560
A victory over fate or he thinks he can 
tap anybody.

963
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,930
He'll jump in.
Fucking guard guy.

964
00:41:21,931 --> 00:41:23,550
He'll fly and guard on you.
Mr.

965
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:28,670
Try to lock you up in his legs.
Was there that night and it struck when 

966
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:28,670
fight or tech.
That was surreal.

967
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,060
Watching that ring side.
That was surreal.

968
00:41:31,061 --> 00:41:33,710
I bet it was sad.
Was sad.

969
00:41:33,711 --> 00:41:36,030
It was crazy.
No big deal.

970
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,550
Just got caught.
I think it's happy.

971
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:39,700
It's happy that we're doing.
Pulled it off in volumes.

972
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,290
Bad motherfucker for the g man and he's 
also middle.

973
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:47,291
Sad to actually be prisoner.
The one not with fighter actually loses 

974
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:51,011
now.
That's as opposed to never have been 

975
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:51,011
president if he was ever fight.
Nah,

976
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:51,260
it's not sad though.
You were there.

977
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:56,350
It's no big deal.
You can appreciate all the other ones 

978
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:56,350
too.

979
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:56,350
You know what I mean?
He's a special athlete.

980
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:56,690
He's a very,
very interesting guy.

981
00:41:56,691 --> 00:41:59,780
To a very fascinating personality,
but he,

982
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,900
the,
the bottom line is the only way to get 

983
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,791
through a guard,
like we're doomed because you've got to 

984
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,501
train with a guy like we're doing.
And if he was training with guys like 

985
00:42:08,501 --> 00:42:08,501
we're doing,
we would hear about it.

986
00:42:08,501 --> 00:42:08,501
We would hear,
oh,

987
00:42:08,501 --> 00:42:08,880
you know,
um,

988
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,080
he just went down and he's spending 
three weeks,

989
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:14,690
so with is going to work on his guard,
you know,

990
00:42:14,691 --> 00:42:19,691
you don't hear about all that shit.
So he's basically working with these 

991
00:42:19,691 --> 00:42:21,821
guys that are pretty good.
They're decent and he's got so much 

992
00:42:21,821 --> 00:42:24,851
confidence because he's undefeated in 10
years and he thinks he can just fall 

993
00:42:24,851 --> 00:42:25,190
into her garden.
You'll be just punched him in the face.

994
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,400
You can't do that with.
Yeah,

995
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,440
it was a capital mistake,
man and I,

996
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,830
that's on another level.

997
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:36,130
You don't appreciate.
I've rolled with guys like for doing 

998
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:36,130
before and not,
not,

999
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:36,530
not that level,
but like john jacques machado,

1000
00:42:36,531 --> 00:42:41,531
he's another,
he's that level as far as like 

1001
00:42:41,531 --> 00:42:41,531
international and they just run through 
you.

1002
00:42:41,531 --> 00:42:45,500
I mean just slap shit on you.
And if you haven't felt that level,

1003
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,690
if you're not in there all the time 
training with that,

1004
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,460
you know,
you can get overconfident.

1005
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:53,020
I bet anybody that fade or puts in his 
guard or if it get in,

1006
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,310
theodore gets in someone's guard in his 
camp.

1007
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,840
Yeah,
I bet he just runs through betty.

1008
00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:00,800
Just postures up breaks.
Nobody probably taps in with triangles,

1009
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:06,180
but he slaps that shit like a fucking 
octopus from hell's just pitching gulen 

1010
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:13,170
fucking attacks and adjusts and attacks.
And every time theodore defends,

1011
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:16,010
he gets deeper in the hole and fight or 
held on for as long as he could,

1012
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:16,220
man.

1013
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,320
But when he broke,
oh my god,

1014
00:43:18,321 --> 00:43:21,840
he's fucking tapping was going to.
John broke his arms,

1015
00:43:21,841 --> 00:43:24,350
were about to go fate or you know,
he's a bad motherfucker,

1016
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:25,460
but he just made a mistake.
Yeah,

1017
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:30,550
he needs it.
Everybody needs to work with the best 

1018
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:30,550
guys.
It used to be that everybody was,

1019
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,180
you know,
you can be able to have like this little

1020
00:43:32,181 --> 00:43:35,000
camp and it was just you and a couple 
other guys that you train with.

1021
00:43:35,001 --> 00:43:36,890
But I don't think you can rock it like 
that anymore.

1022
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:42,070
I think the levels just gotten too high.
You everyone's got to train with the 

1023
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:45,491
best guys.
This is the reason why golden glory in 

1024
00:43:45,491 --> 00:43:48,101
holland have so much success in k one 
and also mixed martial arts because the 

1025
00:43:48,101 --> 00:43:51,641
best guys are.
They're not only and they'll fight each 

1026
00:43:51,641 --> 00:43:51,641
other and they'll fight each other and 
like semi shell now start.

1027
00:43:51,641 --> 00:43:54,050
They're gonna fight each other to find 
each other and that will go for broke.

1028
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:56,620
Errol zimmerman fought semi shelter 
earlier this year and he went for,

1029
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:59,540
went for broke on semi.
You're not under both from the same gene

1030
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:02,000
and when I spar together over in 
holland,

1031
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:05,180
this sparring sessions are as hard as 
kaiwan fights.

1032
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:09,050
They have like this day they called me 
wednesday and everyone on wednesday this

1033
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,200
goes in the gym just beats the fuck out 
of each other like a k,

1034
00:44:12,201 --> 00:44:15,170
one style fight and these guys are best 
mate's.

1035
00:44:15,171 --> 00:44:20,171
A saki will beat on zimmerman.
The two best mates were beat the fuck 

1036
00:44:20,171 --> 00:44:20,640
out of smart.
You know?

1037
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:23,510
That's how they're trained in holland,
but that's normally a golden glory.

1038
00:44:23,511 --> 00:44:25,910
That's at every dutch dream.
It's always been the dutch style.

1039
00:44:25,911 --> 00:44:28,790
The toe hard,
I completely opposite the ties.

1040
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:32,250
We'll go light into barring pause.
We'll go light heavy on pad

1041
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:37,250
work.
Ties are always ferocious on fucking 

1042
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,370
pads and on bags,
but inspiring the thai spa light,

1043
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:41,220
the dutch go light on the bags and the 
pads,

1044
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:44,580
but they fucking kill each other and 
inspiring.

1045
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:49,700
That's such a unique way of approaching 
things and just a mate and then you've 

1046
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:49,700
got guys like,
you know,

1047
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,150
one of the sparring partners is ramon 
dekkers man.

1048
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:56,410
I mean ramond dick is maybe the greatest
moines tie fighter ever and he's golden 

1049
00:44:56,410 --> 00:45:00,261
glory.
One of the head triad is him and call 

1050
00:45:00,261 --> 00:45:00,261
him as and it just,
it's an amazing checkers,

00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,270
He's elbows with phenomenal.
Everything about him.

1054
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:11,580
His leg kicks everything and he's super 
cool.

1055
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:13,290
Guy.
Rob came is like the nicest,

1056
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:18,291
friendliest guy.
One of my mates trains or used to train 

1057
00:45:18,291 --> 00:45:18,291
with him,
cost us mandalore the actor,

1058
00:45:18,291 --> 00:45:20,400
you know and can't know who that guy is 
going to make causing New York.

1059
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,400
He's over there promoting sore.
The new soar film that he's gone for 

1060
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:25,400
three days,
so glen ketchup and man,

1061
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,261
he's been friends with for years and 
this dude's fucking bad ass to try to 

1062
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:32,160
get a lot of hollywood people are nutty,
man.

1063
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,490
Holland's a crazy place.
The red light district and the red light

1064
00:45:35,491 --> 00:45:35,940
district.
We,

1065
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:40,140
last time I was there was 2007 and you 
can just get weed in the coffee shop and

1066
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:43,160
I've never been any interests.
Took us out for the nine.

1067
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,890
Peter likes to party.
Took right?

1068
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,710
If you don't know peter,
he's a multiple time k,

1069
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:49,400
one k,
one world champion.

1070
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,610
Bad motherfucker still in there 
slugging.

1071
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:54,010
Solving.
Still polo forest with a grumpy look.

1072
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,920
Fucking good man.
Incredible man.

1073
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,000
His body was yoked.
It looks like he's obviously been 

1074
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,220
trained like a motherfucker.
Just insane guy going.

1075
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:04,800
One of the nicest human beings I've ever
fucking met.

1076
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:08,100
Supernova greets me with a hug all the 
time is always laughing.

1077
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:08,950
Just,
you know,

1078
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,220
he took us out in $2,007
million right?

1079
00:46:11,221 --> 00:46:14,100
Cfo and a few of peter's mates went to 
the red light district.

1080
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:19,610
Dude,
all the stories you've heard about the 

1081
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:19,610
red light district,
that true.

1082
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,370
Well,
peter arts was smoking weed all day.

1083
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:25,430
Fadeaway it's had a fucking case of 
joints in his pocket that he would rip 

1084
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:29,211
back and he's best made open the third 
coffee house in amsterdam in like 1967.

1085
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,900
So he was like a pioneer of weed and 
amsterdam,

1086
00:46:33,901 --> 00:46:38,901
right?
Don't you think people would be 

1087
00:46:38,901 --> 00:46:41,361
surprised if they found out how many 
high level fighters in mma guys smoke 

1088
00:46:41,361 --> 00:46:42,030
weed.
It's a big.

1089
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:46,050
The shoW there in amsterdam in amsterdam
arena and midway through and then having

1090
00:46:46,051 --> 00:46:51,051
to mission.
You'd go outside to the smoking section 

1091
00:46:51,051 --> 00:46:54,020
and it is just fucking.
We central moving through the midst of 

1092
00:46:54,181 --> 00:46:59,181
all this marijuana smoker.
He smoked weed when a lot of ufc 

1093
00:46:59,181 --> 00:46:59,680
champions.
Oh man,

1094
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:05,900
I believe it.
I fucking believe in a lot of the k 

1095
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:05,900
guys.
A lot of the mma guys.

1096
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:10,791
I know a lot of fucking nick diaz is not
the only one that has had the greatest 

1097
00:47:11,881 --> 00:47:13,860
quote of all time.
Nick diaz is fighting tonight.

1098
00:47:13,861 --> 00:47:18,861
We're going to see it in half an hour.
Nick diaz had the greatest quote of all 

1099
00:47:18,861 --> 00:47:18,861
time.
He said,

1100
00:47:18,861 --> 00:47:20,760
I don't think pot is getting in the way 
of my mma career.

1101
00:47:20,761 --> 00:47:22,700
I think mma is getting in the way of my 
pots.

1102
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,340
I love it,
man.

1103
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:31,490
That's fucking great.
Get in the way of my weed smoke.

1104
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:36,220
Where do you See that video?
That diaz put on youtube after I did the

1105
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:41,221
voice versus made him and he's driving 
and he puts the camera down.

1106
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,550
How much fucking pumped you actually 
fucking smoke.

1107
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:49,660
ThAt was funny.
As fan to the bowl.

1108
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:51,250
Oh man.
Him and his brother.

1109
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:52,830
I loved those times.
Believable,

1110
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,430
man.
Those dudes are entertaining.

1111
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,920
Unless you get them amsterdam with those
two in there.

1112
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:02,760
Are you kidding me?
That would be running the cafe.

1113
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,750
Throw the fucking book is in the 
windows.

1114
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:09,070
He could already be over there.
It might be the first people to die from

1115
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:13,720
weed for the first.
We might fuck up the whole cause did the

1116
00:48:13,721 --> 00:48:16,060
weed is a menu.
It's like you go to a restaurant here,

1117
00:48:16,061 --> 00:48:18,400
you get a giant menu.
There's a menu of weed.

1118
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:22,270
You've got like I'd say about 30 
variations to choose from.

1119
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,740
We have that here.
It's crazy.

1120
00:48:23,741 --> 00:48:25,360
You know,
we hAve that in these medical places.

1121
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:26,860
I'll take you to one.
I'll take you to one more.

1122
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:27,760
We're leaving here.
Oh yeah,

1123
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:28,540
yeah.
You gotta go.

1124
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:30,670
You gotta see this because it's the 
craziest thing ever.

1125
00:48:30,671 --> 00:48:34,120
You go look at a capital of johnny drama
in ultra truck.

1126
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:35,950
Is that?
Yeah,

1127
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:39,800
they got lollipops sodA.
Really?

1128
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:41,380
All kinds of candies.
Cookies,

1129
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:42,370
cakes,
brownies.

1130
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,410
Do you need holland?
Yeah.

1131
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:47,740
Mushroom and the big man.
Big chalkboard.

1132
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:52,741
Like one of those dry erase boards 
filled with like different strains and 

1133
00:48:52,741 --> 00:48:54,240
this is how much it is announced as much
as an eighth.

1134
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:59,350
Amazing.
They have a 50 slash 60 varieties crap 

1135
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:02,850
everywhere all the time.
Like sativas very difficult to grow 

1136
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:05,880
there.
It's harder to grow than indicas and 

1137
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:05,880
sativas space.
We'd.

1138
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:11,090
Well you go to the place near my house,
10 different vArieties that seems 

1139
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:13,840
different varieties of sativa.
That's crazy hard sativa,

1140
00:49:13,841 --> 00:49:16,270
and when you live in the east coast 
where it's illegal heart,

1141
00:49:16,271 --> 00:49:19,630
it's fucked to get a good sativa.
You gotta know somebody who's a grower.

1142
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,390
It's willing to take a chance to make a 
superior weed.

1143
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:27,391
It's like it takes more time and so it 
costs more money in the yield is 

1144
00:49:27,391 --> 00:49:27,391
smaller.
Did when I was in amsterdam,

1145
00:49:27,391 --> 00:49:31,870
I smoked or vaporized bone and it fucked
me because peter goes,

1146
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:33,220
hey mikey,
try this,

1147
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:35,260
try this.
It's a bong and I hate smoking,

1148
00:49:35,261 --> 00:49:38,030
but I didn't smoke much anyway and I'll 
smoke bombs A couple of times,

1149
00:49:38,031 --> 00:49:39,700
but to me they feel dirty.
Right,

1150
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:44,730
right.
So you put this thing into my mouth and 

1151
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:45,320
I'm likE,
peter,

1152
00:49:45,321 --> 00:49:47,660
I can't see anything here.
No effect.

1153
00:49:47,661 --> 00:49:48,350
Nothing goes.
No,

1154
00:49:48,351 --> 00:49:48,480
no,
no.

1155
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:53,080
This do it again,
peter.

1156
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,900
I can't fucking.
I don't think it's nothing.

1157
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:01,970
Oh fuck.
What the fuck comes out.

1158
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:07,470
It's miss.
For people that don't know what a vapor 

1159
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:11,421
hours it does is,
it heats the thc to a point where it 

1160
00:50:11,421 --> 00:50:15,111
doesn't burn the plant material,
but it burns off the tfc and makes a 

1161
00:50:15,111 --> 00:50:17,200
vapor out of it and visible.
You cannot see It.

1162
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,770
I didn't see it.
I didn't know it was breathing.

1163
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,520
Exhaling any smoke enough.
You sort of see it,

1164
00:50:22,521 --> 00:50:24,230
but it looks like not much.
It doesn't look.

1165
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,920
You get used to like see you smoke a 
joint.

1166
00:50:25,921 --> 00:50:27,560
You take a deep breath,
you blow it out.

1167
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:28,160
There's a big

1168
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,230
cloud is one of you.
This is not a big crier.

1169
00:50:30,231 --> 00:50:31,970
I was expecting big clown.
I was like fucking.

1170
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,320
I wanted her to pure sensation to.
It was crazy.

1171
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,890
It was like there's something in the 
burning of the plant to.

1172
00:50:39,891 --> 00:50:41,840
I wonder if that has a psychoactive 
effect.

1173
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:47,050
Like I wonder if there's a psychoactive 
effect from the actual burning of the 

1174
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:50,201
leaves.
Like maybe together those things like 

1175
00:50:50,201 --> 00:50:53,200
there's maybe a comms you a bit or 
something because there's like hundreds 

1176
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,041
of different leaves out there though and
shit out there that no one has thought 

1177
00:50:57,951 --> 00:51:02,951
to smoke.
That is yet to be discovered as 

1178
00:51:02,951 --> 00:51:05,021
smokeable.
Do you think like there's like the mud 

1179
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:06,980
or dirt out there that someone could 
maybe roll into a fucking piece of paper

1180
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:11,981
and smoking.
No one's like smoked that mud or shell 

1181
00:51:11,981 --> 00:51:14,420
or that fucking a sea urchin that you 
can smoke it.

1182
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:17,070
This is going to be shit out there that 
no one had discovered me.

1183
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:22,360
A furniture plants.
I mean if you look at the amazon Wasn't 

1184
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:26,141
marijuana discovered like we discovered 
from goats eating it really fucking 

1185
00:51:26,141 --> 00:51:30,670
ancient days go to a,
hitting it and then go to a swaying in 

1186
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:30,670
the paddocks.
So the farmers are like,

1187
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,920
hm,
the goats eat these strange looking weed

1188
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:38,060
and they stumbling paddock where we must
try to eat it with withheld you here.

1189
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:39,880
That's what a lot of my friends was 
telling.

1190
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:45,150
It might be another urban legend,
but I heard it was goats discovered 

1191
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:45,310
weed,
you know,

1192
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,740
that doesn't even make sense.
The guides would high on.

1193
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:54,330
I'm fucking know man.
You're telling me there's 10 different 

1194
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:54,330
types of services,
whatever.

1195
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:59,600
So vj,
that's fish fish,

1196
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:00,990
cook with.
Oh.

1197
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,990
And I was.
When I did that vaporized bong,

1198
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,090
20 minutes later I was in a place called
banana bar and some fucking dirty hooker

1199
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:10,220
was shooting these giant deal.
Does that have been pushing,

1200
00:52:10,221 --> 00:52:13,170
hitting me in the chest and kick backing
up five pesos.

1201
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:18,690
And she was shooting these giant dildo 
is like thick fucking things out of a 

1202
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:23,411
pussy and hitting me smack on the chest.
And then another one would come over and

1203
00:52:24,261 --> 00:52:26,820
she had like a texture,
like a marker.

1204
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:28,490
She goes,
what's your name?

1205
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:32,360
I got michael.
So she had a postcard and she sticks the

1206
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:34,760
marker in a pushy hoppers over the 
postcard.

1207
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:39,940
And dude with perfect penmanship.
Perfect fucking cursive writing her.

1208
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:46,090
I see michAel love banana by like,
oh my postcard from a pussy.

1209
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,280
Perfect penmanship.
How does the postcard stay in place?

1210
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:57,670
I've still got her at home.
She had her toes heal her heel because 

1211
00:52:57,670 --> 00:53:00,890
she squatted over it.
So one of them was carla hall's postcard

1212
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:04,970
as her pussy does this perfectly to 
Michael Love.

1213
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:07,850
Fascinating about.
It was fucking incredible nightmare.

1214
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,560
I wonder whAt made them come up with 
that.

1215
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:12,200
I wonder if they're wondering whether we
need something new for this business.

1216
00:53:12,201 --> 00:53:13,700
We are not getting enough people in 
here,

1217
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:18,050
but I wonder if this is a top of the 
girls do at slumber parties when they're

1218
00:53:18,051 --> 00:53:18,860
young.
Yeah,

1219
00:53:18,861 --> 00:53:20,750
they're a little bit drunk or movements.
Don't like,

1220
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,840
hey,
let's stick a fucking pussy and try.

1221
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,180
Maybe you're hanging out with a bunch of
freaks.

1222
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,560
You discover these telling.
I want it to go to that guilt again.

1223
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,720
How did you know?
At what age do you know you can write 

1224
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:35,720
with your pussy?
Imperfect cursive.

1225
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,920
If I had to guess,
I would.

1226
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,610
I would guess something.
Whatever the equation was involved.

1227
00:53:40,611 --> 00:53:44,810
A dude and money.
That's how a pen got up your pussy.

1228
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,120
Well,
how do you shoot that or he.

1229
00:53:47,121 --> 00:53:48,460
You did a favor for him,
but it's okay.

1230
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:53,870
But did he lift you in a hotel room and 
really stuck with me?

1231
00:53:56,221 --> 00:53:59,470
A letter wIth the pussy.
When I look at it,

1232
00:53:59,471 --> 00:54:02,440
I know that it's you pushing the road.
Come on.

1233
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:08,680
I can't even write with magazines there.
What about the girls on Macau?

1234
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,630
If you have been to Macau,
Macau,

1235
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:16,480
Macau is like a 45 minute boat ride from
Hong Kong.

1236
00:54:16,481 --> 00:54:20,710
It's between China and Hong Kong island.
Yeah.

1237
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,690
It's like the vegas of asia.
It's a crazy madhouse.

1238
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:28,740
Casino silent,
but I've seen some dirty ass sex shows 

1239
00:54:28,961 --> 00:54:31,720
in Macau with this.
One chick had the dots,

1240
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:36,870
the dots in a pussy and there were 
balloons up on the ceiling and with 

1241
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:39,410
pinpoint fucking sniper precision,
she would lean back,

1242
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,490
fire,
adopt,

1243
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:43,990
pop the balloons,
one after the other.

1244
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:49,200
She's another chick had razorblades 
right strung together and she reaches 

1245
00:54:50,681 --> 00:54:55,681
into her village and pulls out this line
of razorblades one after the other and 

1246
00:54:56,561 --> 00:54:57,130
you're thinking,
oh,

1247
00:54:57,131 --> 00:54:59,290
thAt's bullshit.
That is made of plastic or something.

1248
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,510
Then she grabs the razorblades into 
show.

1249
00:55:01,511 --> 00:55:04,180
One of the ones that came out of her 
pussy gets a piece of paper,

1250
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:05,890
slice slices,
a piece of paper.

1251
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:07,810
I'm like,
that's fucking seAt.

1252
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:12,900
Yeah.
You know that's funny that you just 

1253
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,030
brought that up because there was a 
conversation we had on here last week 

1254
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:16,000
about the hookers and Vietnam.
WHether or not they really did put razor

1255
00:55:16,001 --> 00:55:21,001
blades.
I have seen the ucs blades come out of 

1256
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:26,401
the pussy,
so they easily could have done that to 

1257
00:55:26,401 --> 00:55:28,110
gis,
like stuck a razor blade in there and 

1258
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:28,110
then the guy fucks.
I'm going to cut their dick and half.

1259
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:31,580
One of my mates in Australia finger to 
go on a club once and he went,

1260
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:34,450
he went to finger her and he felt scabs 
inside it.

1261
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:42,910
Oh,
I sent a letter to me.

1262
00:55:42,911 --> 00:55:46,140
Shake my hand.
Like I fucking touching that head.

1263
00:55:46,141 --> 00:55:48,830
Put a fucking glove on.
Oh my god.

1264
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,450
Are you sticking it in your box hunting?
Yeah,

1265
00:55:51,451 --> 00:55:56,451
exactly right.
There's some evil shit going on here 

1266
00:55:56,451 --> 00:56:00,460
guys.
Bowls look disgusting and wrinkled and 

1267
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:00,460
shit.
But man unef.

1268
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:04,700
Some girls sometimes they have to get a 
mirror and stand over it and look down 

1269
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:08,271
and see how fucked up the veggies look 
because some girls got some fucked up 

1270
00:56:08,271 --> 00:56:08,271
poussey's happening,
man.

1271
00:56:08,271 --> 00:56:11,970
The ones who have the Big fluffy fucking
like fucking be lips like that.

1272
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:16,010
I like to.
I like that man.

1273
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:18,360
I'm fucking hang down.
Like that's like

1274
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,900
trippiest thing ever is.
When you look at female bodybuilders and

1275
00:56:22,901 --> 00:56:24,010
you there,
the little dixit,

1276
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,040
they're growing the cleat because of the
roy.

1277
00:56:26,041 --> 00:56:28,600
It's because I used to editor a 
bodybuilding magazine back in the day,

1278
00:56:28,601 --> 00:56:33,601
so I used to interview a lot of female 
bodybuilders and they cleat comes like 

1279
00:56:33,601 --> 00:56:34,630
that.
Like a small dick.

1280
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,760
but they are,
I never,

1281
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:42,030
I never fucked anybody.
Builders told being in the industry is 

1282
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:43,300
like fire the horniest fucking cans out 
there,

1283
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:48,340
female bodybuilder fAster and because 
all you need to do is touch the big 

1284
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:51,250
penis.
Cliteracy and I basically have an orgasm

1285
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:56,400
like insanely sexually excited get.
Sometimes the doctor,

1286
00:56:57,821 --> 00:57:02,821
a doctor will put a woman on 
testosterone for something like some 

1287
00:57:02,821 --> 00:57:06,511
sort of an ailment.
Usually they've got skin disease when 

1288
00:57:06,511 --> 00:57:06,511
they're young,
the girls will go on on a,

1289
00:57:06,511 --> 00:57:08,590
on steroids,
on testosterone.

1290
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:13,591
It's a shame because one of my friends,
she's a photographer back home and when 

1291
00:57:13,591 --> 00:57:18,211
she was young,
I've seen photos of what she was a 

1292
00:57:18,211 --> 00:57:18,211
beautiful,
beautiful young girl.

1293
00:57:18,211 --> 00:57:20,590
But then she started to develop skin 
problems and bad acne.

1294
00:57:20,591 --> 00:57:24,100
That was something hormonal and she had 
to go on steroids to get rid of it.

1295
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,310
And then now she's fucking fucked up.
Ugly,

1296
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:28,480
like bad.
the poor thing.

1297
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,240
She's fucked up.
She looks like a man named for her.

1298
00:57:31,241 --> 00:57:32,910
Behind her back is animal.
No,

1299
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:34,780
she looks like a fucking animal.
But yeah,

1300
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:39,860
she's beautiful.
She was hot when she was young and then 

1301
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:39,860
unfortunately young,
uh,

1302
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:40,640
you know,
when she'll,

1303
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:42,520
she'll fucking eight,
nine years old.

1304
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,770
What the fuck?
He's a cute kid.

1305
00:57:44,771 --> 00:57:46,550
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Well,

1306
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,990
there are some girls though that started
out really pretty and then something,

1307
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:52,790
some monkey wrench goes along the way 
and then the,

1308
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,410
the design of the universe decides to 
take it back and you're not hot anymore.

1309
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:57,640
Right.
I've seen that happen.

1310
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:02,620
Girls were really pretty when they were 
like 13 or 14 and then you graduate high

1311
00:58:02,621 --> 00:58:04,600
school and you run into when they're 
like 22,

1312
00:58:04,601 --> 00:58:05,920
23 and you're like,
what happened?

1313
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:09,490
I saw the girl that I used to fantasize 
over in highschool,

1314
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,130
lisa,
right at shows that the dude,

1315
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,650
the guild that everyone wanted to 
fucking hospital shows that it.

1316
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:19,680
Gil shows like the one and I recently 
chatted to another friend of mine on 

1317
00:58:20,381 --> 00:58:25,381
facebook that was at the guild school 
that was sister school to our school 

1318
00:58:25,381 --> 00:58:28,261
back then.
And I was talking about this Lisa Gill 

1319
00:58:28,261 --> 00:58:28,261
and wonder what lisa is doing now.
I wonder if she's still hot.

1320
00:58:28,261 --> 00:58:28,750
She goes,

1321
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:33,990
I solely lisa recently.
She's got three kids and I've got a 

1322
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:33,990
photo of it.
Do you want to see it?

1323
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:33,990
I'm like,

1324
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:37,510

1325
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:38,950

1326
00:58:38,951 --> 00:58:40,120
That's lisa,
my friends.

1327
00:58:40,121 --> 00:58:42,760
Like that's what your eat gill looks 
like now.

1328
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:45,820
Do you think that she does the same 
thing every time she watches k one

1329
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:54,010
Because that's.
Do

1330
00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:02,490
you know what the thing is man?
I weighed myself this morning and happy 

1331
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:04,020
with the results I was because I lost a 
lot of white racial issues.

1332
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:07,630
We lost probably this year.
I've lost about 11 kilos.

1333
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,280
What's that?
Twenty four pounds.

1334
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:10,900
Four pounds.
I'm like,

1335
00:59:10,901 --> 00:59:15,901
I haven't been this.
Had this least white since like high 

1336
00:59:15,901 --> 00:59:16,360
school,
so I was fucking huge man.

1337
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:18,540
Like a lot bigger than I am now.
A lot,

1338
00:59:18,541 --> 00:59:19,660
lot bigger.
That's awesome.

1339
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:23,240
Kevin james is lost like almost 50 
pounds to to love kevin.

1340
00:59:23,241 --> 00:59:24,320
James is a great guy.
You know,

1341
00:59:24,321 --> 00:59:26,940
irene had no idea who he was really 
short.

1342
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:29,360
We came here today.
Well watching king of queens was on tv.

1343
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:31,130
She's laughing her ass off and I go,

1344
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:32,660

he's really good mates with joe.

1345
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:33,770
She goes,

1346
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:34,340
okay.
Yeah.

1347
00:59:34,341 --> 00:59:39,341
Joe knows him really well.
He's like in a movie of ease and their 

1348
00:59:39,341 --> 00:59:39,341
management.

1349
00:59:39,341 --> 00:59:39,590
Same.
They really close mates and she goes,

1350
00:59:39,591 --> 00:59:40,270
oh,
who is he?

1351
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,000
I got to Kevin James.
She just never saw the sitcom just yet,

1352
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:47,150
but he's been in so many movies to now 
I'm in Australia as well,

1353
00:59:47,151 --> 00:59:49,970
but she just doesn't know know.
Sometimes you don't know.

1354
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:52,130
Sometimes someone will talk to me about 
some singer,

1355
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:52,910
like,
oh my god,

1356
00:59:52,911 --> 00:59:53,140
blah,
blah,

1357
00:59:53,141 --> 00:59:54,570
blah is playing here.
I'm like,

1358
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,370
man,
I was plaYing in New York next week,

1359
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,040
but you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

1360
00:59:59,080 --> 00:59:59,910
So I'm going to.
You'll,

1361
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,420
you'll be like,
what are you talking about?

1362
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:06,520
Who is this?
And then you find out they've sold like 

1363
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:06,520
50 million albums all over the world.
Justin bieber was,

1364
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:08,570
everyone's got justin bieber,
justin bieber.

1365
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:11,920
Who the fuck is this justin bieber song?
Fuck yeah.

1366
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:17,110
And then I heard the song on the radio.
I'm doing this one in the clothing 

1367
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:17,130
store,
wherever I was and my to Iran guy.

1368
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,540
Who is this?
It's justin bieber.

1369
01:00:18,541 --> 01:00:23,541
I'll go,
this is a fucking little kid that 

1370
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:23,541
everyone's talking about.
What am I dancing?

1371
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:25,790
I'm watching a video and he gets hit in 
the head with a bottle of that.

1372
01:00:25,791 --> 01:00:30,791
Somebody throws a water bottle and it 
hit someone head and then people think 

1373
01:00:30,791 --> 01:00:31,040
it's funny and everyone's like passing 
it back and forth on facebook.

1374
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:31,580
I'm like,
listen,

1375
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:36,820
you're looking at a little vulnerable.
Twelve year olD kid has probably grown 

1376
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:39,110
cunt.
Fucking water.

1377
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:43,400
I mean he was holding on water bottle 
like the little fucking man.

1378
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:45,500
Fuck,
he's fucked,

1379
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:50,520
but for no charge at a young age,
his development will be forever.

1380
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:54,800
Excuse already saw in the book shop the 
biography of justin bieber.

1381
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,310
The kids like 14.
How much of a biography can you write?

1382
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:01,550
What he done?
Has he been fucking got a head job yet?

1383
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,530
But what if it was all.

1384
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:06,140
What If we start talking about chicks?
He fucks.

1385
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:10,820
It just makes the justin bieber pussy 
diary was like 15.

1386
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,900
Just able to secure a real solid boner 
for the first time in my life.

1387
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:20,120
I think first pubic hair and photographs
that and puts it in the center of the 

1388
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,080
boot and the poor kid.
He's very small,

1389
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:25,240
very small and very small for like 14.
Like he's going to be a tiny man.

1390
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:26,690
Little fucking no,
but they,

1391
01:01:26,691 --> 01:01:31,691
they,
the girls right now are just like 

1392
01:01:31,691 --> 01:01:31,691
confused,
like,

1393
01:01:31,691 --> 01:01:34,510
well he's up there and he sang in and I 
think I want to fuck them or something 

1394
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:35,720
and do.
The scary thing is that this,

1395
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:40,730
this scared me the other day.
Erin's telling me about her little 

1396
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:40,730
cousin,
my little cousin,

1397
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:44,591
she's 12 years old.
She's in love with justin bieber and so 

1398
01:01:44,591 --> 01:01:48,760
she says to irene,
justin bieber is a friend of mine on 

1399
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:48,760
facebook,
right?

1400
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:49,100
And erin's like,
okay,

1401
01:01:49,101 --> 01:01:54,101
thinking you know,
it's a group or whatever that she likes 

1402
01:01:54,101 --> 01:01:54,101
justin bieber.
She goes,

1403
01:01:54,101 --> 01:01:57,520
oh yeah.
And justin and I talk every other night 

1404
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:57,520
and he's a really nice guy and I'm going
to.

1405
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:02,291
Irene,
do you realize that some dude posing as 

1406
01:02:02,291 --> 01:02:05,621
justin bieber on facebook who your 12 
year old niece or cousin is accepted as 

1407
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:09,860
a friend that he's talking to her and 
buttering up a 12 year old every night,

1408
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:15,040
like fucking borchers out there,
pedophile motherfuckers who had 

1409
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:19,870
discovered himself as justin bieber 
talking to 12 year old ozzie gills on 

1410
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:19,870
facebook.
IT just.

1411
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:20,100
it could

1412
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:25,100
just be 12 year old boys,
so I thought you were going to say it 

1413
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:25,650
could just be justin bieber,
justin bieber.

1414
01:02:25,651 --> 01:02:26,420
Who knows.
Good.

1415
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:29,190
Could just be 12 year old boys.
Get on facebook.

1416
01:02:29,191 --> 01:02:30,660
I go on twitter.
I do it all the time.

1417
01:02:30,661 --> 01:02:31,980
You know?
Anybody could be doing it.

1418
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:33,650
Hit me.
I know there's a lot of like,

1419
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:36,110
you know like aston kutcher really does.
He really goes.

1420
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,060
Justin bieber's not out there.
Twitter and chicks.

1421
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:42,600
I'm done.
He's got a 12 year old girl in melbourne

1422
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:47,640
maybe is trying to set it up for a down 
under two.

1423
01:02:48,361 --> 01:02:52,410
I'll probably back 24 months by then.
I'll be all blowed up.

1424
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:55,800
You know what I'm saying?
I mean I have it going.

1425
01:02:55,801 --> 01:02:57,420
Oh baby,
come to America,

1426
01:02:57,421 --> 01:03:00,870
the middle ages only 15 in Australia.
You to wait another couple of years.

1427
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,010
How old you have to be necessarily.

1428
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:04,920
You can fuck it.
16,

1429
01:03:04,921 --> 01:03:07,110
but you can only fuck someone who is 
under 18.

1430
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:10,650
over 18 and fucking 16 year old.
That's smart.

1431
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:11,910
Yeah.
that's good move.

1432
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:12,350
Yeah,
that's,

1433
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,760
that's,
that's a 16 year olds from fucking.

1434
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:16,530
Sorry,
come on man.

1435
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:21,590
But you guys have a more relaxed 
attitude towards a lot of things over 

1436
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:21,660
there.
So much more relaxed when you got out of

1437
01:03:21,661 --> 01:03:26,661
high school.
Let me ask you this because this is the 

1438
01:03:26,661 --> 01:03:26,661
big thing in America is America.
Well,

1439
01:03:26,661 --> 01:03:28,620
I grew up in newton,
Massachusetts and newton was a,

1440
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:31,560
you know,
a lot of successful people lived there,

1441
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:33,930
know a lot of people who were like,
you know,

1442
01:03:33,931 --> 01:03:38,931
doctors and lawyers and they were very 
into their kids' academic careers and it

1443
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:41,520
was like,
it was a school where it was like,

1444
01:03:41,521 --> 01:03:46,521
it was a very good school,
like really highly rated and everybody 

1445
01:03:46,521 --> 01:03:46,521
was super ambitious to,
you know,

1446
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:48,840
to get out there and to go to college 
and they get things done.

1447
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:54,290
When You guys graduated,
do you feel like this enormous pressure 

1448
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:57,770
to like to go make something of your 
life that's not really the college 

1449
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:59,370
system that you have in the states 
doesn't as eastern Australia,

1450
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:00,630
what is,
how do you guys do it?

1451
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:03,000
So we got high school then after high 
school,

1452
01:04:03,001 --> 01:04:05,180
go to university,
but we don't have frets,

1453
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:08,970
we don't live on campus and we don't 
move into state to go to university.

1454
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,770
In fact,
in America,

1455
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:15,771
wherever I go,
no one is ever from the state where I 

1456
01:04:15,771 --> 01:04:15,870
meet them.
It's like you're from Massachusetts,

1457
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:18,680
boston where we're originally from.
Massachusetts,

1458
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:19,520
yeah.
Okay.

1459
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:21,060
So you're From Massachusetts,
you live in,

1460
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:26,090
in California,
everyone is from a different state to 

1461
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:28,731
where they were born in Australia.
Everyone pretty much remains wherever 

1462
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:29,400
you're born really.
You grow up.

1463
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:31,200
You're born in melbourne,
you grew up in melbourne,

1464
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:32,990
you work in melbourne having family.

1465
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:35,820
Melbourne went to university in 
melbourne uni in melbourne.

1466
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:41,090
No one ever goes to match the 
university's interstate and moves 

1467
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:44,631
around.
Everyone is pretty much where they're 

1468
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:46,701
from and there's not really that that 
feel of I'm going to go out and conquer 

1469
01:04:46,701 --> 01:04:48,360
the world and become a politician or 
change the world in any way.

1470
01:04:48,361 --> 01:04:48,750
It's like,
no,

1471
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:50,160
fuck it.
I finished high school.

1472
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:51,580
I'm gonna.
Relax.

1473
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:53,070
So much.
Go out and conquer.

1474
01:04:53,071 --> 01:04:54,720
The world is.
Don't be a fucking loser.

1475
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:56,230
Oh,
there's a lot of pressure.

1476
01:04:56,270 --> 01:05:01,270
Go out and get a fucking job.
Let's go get in Australia because our 

1477
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:04,660
economy is really good at the moment.
Jozy announced is really good at those.

1478
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:09,130
Really strong against.
Against the us dollar has rallied.

1479
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:14,490
The doll is that the dol is easy to get 
bullied,

1480
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:18,760
so you can be a blood job and just claim
the dol to toll meaning welfare.

1481
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:20,010
Oh,
domain and welfare.

1482
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:20,920
Yeah,
and it's decent.

1483
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:25,960
The dozer,
I know people that live solely off the 

1484
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:25,960
dol.
really?

1485
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:26,170
That's it.
I get my adult.

1486
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:28,210
how much you get?
Maybe a fortnight.

1487
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:34,480
FortnIght.
What do you pick up your here?

1488
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:39,810
Motherfucker night for that is maybe if 
I'm my chicks watching the tutors and 

1489
01:05:40,181 --> 01:05:43,460
I'm trying to get some pushing.
Fortnight you might get like $200.

1490
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:46,630
Fuck you.
Fuck you in a fortnight in the ass,

1491
01:05:46,631 --> 01:05:47,350
darling.
Yes.

1492
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,920
Maybe 200 bucks every two weeks.
Two hundred and 20 bucks every two 

1493
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:52,920
weeks.
Highly livable.

1494
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:54,270
Live off that.
Yeah.

1495
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,320
I guess if you had to,
that's for doing nothing.

1496
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,270
That's nothing to what we call an 
Australia.

1497
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:00,220
A dole bludger.
Wow.

1498
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,450
Yeah,
and there's a lot of those.

1499
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:04,570
Does that keep everybody calm?
So there's always something.

1500
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,910
Even if you're a fucking loser,
you always have something you don't have

1501
01:06:06,911 --> 01:06:07,930
to rob and steal.

1502
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:10,360
And do you know because you're an 
argument for that.

1503
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:13,510
Is there an argument for the idiots are 
always going to be idiots.

1504
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:16,540
Losers are always going to be losers.
Just if you give a little bit money,

1505
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:17,500
you know,
who cares?

1506
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:22,530
This is this way.
At least they have something invested 

1507
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:22,530
back into the economy,
but now it's usually invested.

1508
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:26,980
Well unless you're a drug dealer will 
purchasing alcohol,

1509
01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:29,170
but it's far too easy that if there's 
too many.

1510
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,370
Is that a strategy though?
You know,

1511
01:06:31,371 --> 01:06:36,371
like let's let people be fucking losers 
and just take care of them and then 

1512
01:06:36,371 --> 01:06:37,390
there'll be less crime.
Is that makes sense?

1513
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:39,970
I'm asking them.
I don't know.

1514
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:45,560
I don't think it's a strategy.
The dole didn't come in until like 1975 

1515
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:49,440
when there was a lady.
You don't have it then if people are 

1516
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:49,440
forced to catch up,
right?

1517
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:49,720
People are forced to pay their own way 
and,

1518
01:06:49,721 --> 01:06:52,140
and you know,
the thing is though,

1519
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:56,290
I know a guy who's on the doll and he 
will not get off his ass to get a Job.

1520
01:06:56,290 --> 01:07:01,290
He will not even go for job interviews.
he claims that he's got some disability 

1521
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:01,290
or whatever,
which he hasn't.

1522
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:02,500
And It's like,
dude,

1523
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:07,560
my fucking Texas that I work hard for my
money and I've got to give money to the 

1524
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:07,840
government.
Pay fucking Texas.

1525
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:12,870
Then going your pocket to pay you to 
drink alcohol at home all day.

1526
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:18,200
But I would rather give my tax money to 
losers and drunks and idiots and people 

1527
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,090
had no ambition whatsoever.
Then to war,

1528
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,530
I would rather.
Oh look,

1529
01:07:23,531 --> 01:07:28,531
I don't know what I'm saying.
He goes to war and there's nothing I 

1530
01:07:28,531 --> 01:07:31,651
could say.
I'd rather put the fucking loses to 

1531
01:07:31,651 --> 01:07:31,651
work,
man.

1532
01:07:31,651 --> 01:07:31,651
It's like,
you know what?

1533
01:07:31,651 --> 01:07:34,660
You want the dope.
You're going to fucking go and work in 

1534
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:34,660
this plant.
You're going to work in this factory.

1535
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:35,290
You're gonna fucking send these mailers 
out.

1536
01:07:35,291 --> 01:07:36,370
You're going to do shit.

1537
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,340
You're going to go volunteer in fucking 
a hospitals.

1538
01:07:39,341 --> 01:07:44,341
That's a great idea.
Or in canteen or somewhere where they 

1539
01:07:44,341 --> 01:07:44,410
need you and volunteer your time and 
your services,

1540
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:49,180
your losers per capita in America or in 
Australia.

1541
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:56,160
Like what?
The percentage of losers as opposed to 

1542
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:56,160
regular people.
What do you qualify as a loser?

1543
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,890
As a homeless person?
I'll lose it Just because fuck you.

1544
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:00,970
You lost like you're homeless.
You lost.

1545
01:08:00,971 --> 01:08:01,900
I mean,
you might not.

1546
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:06,960
You're not going to be a loser for life.
I'm not saying that this is a death 

1547
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:06,960
sentence.
I'm saying America,

1548
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:07,570
if you're outside,
he got a lot of.

1549
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:11,950
It disappoints me for the most powerful 
country in the world.

1550
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:14,290
Great America too.
It's satisfied,

1551
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,250
man.
You got a lot of insane

1552
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:16,820
people.
You know.

1553
01:08:16,821 --> 01:08:21,821
One of the reasons why the homeless 
population rocketed in the 19 eighties 

1554
01:08:21,821 --> 01:08:22,460
just because ronald reagan in his 
administration,

1555
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:27,480
they changed the definition of insanity,
so there's a lot of people that were in 

1556
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:29,570
fucking the asylums man,
like you're all right.

1557
01:08:29,571 --> 01:08:34,571
We were wrong.
You're not crazy to fucking get your 

1558
01:08:34,571 --> 01:08:35,710
freak on.
I never understood it,

1559
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:37,490
man,
and it's mental illness.

1560
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:40,670
Exposure to people.
Being homeless.

1561
01:08:40,671 --> 01:08:44,210
When I was a kid growing up and watching
american tv was watching the brady bunch

1562
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:46,520
and how they used to run away from home 
when you're a kid.

1563
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:49,490
I used to think that's how people ended 
up homeless or running away from home.

1564
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:54,550
Some people did.
How many people ran away from home and 

1565
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:57,101
just became fucked up hollywood?
HavE you driven around downtown 

1566
01:08:57,621 --> 01:09:02,621
hollywood?
Some irene is holding my hand really 

1567
01:09:02,621 --> 01:09:03,350
tight.
It's like last place,

1568
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:04,940
last place.

1569
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:09,940
When people look at hollywood boulevard,
this is the center of showbiz in the 

1570
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:10,100
world.
The fuck it is.

1571
01:09:10,101 --> 01:09:12,530
It's a shit hole.
I will give you more fucked up.

1572
01:09:12,531 --> 01:09:14,540
Have you been to Italy?
I've been to rome.

1573
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:15,380
No.
No.

1574
01:09:15,381 --> 01:09:20,381
Never.
You want to say the most fucked up site 

1575
01:09:20,381 --> 01:09:20,381
in the world and this is sad.
You go to the vatican,

1576
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:25,480
the most opulent place on the planet.
You have no Idea the money that is 

1577
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:28,580
fucking dripping off every building,
the vatican and the vatican,

1578
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,280
and the catholic church as a 
institution,

1579
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:34,310
but immediately before you set foot in 
the door,

1580
01:09:34,311 --> 01:09:39,140
the vatican on the street there are the 
most disgusting disfigured.

1581
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:42,950
Now the bIggest you will ever say.
Arms missing.

1582
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:47,980
Fingers killed around eyes missing and 
shit on the fucking streets outsIde the 

1583
01:09:48,711 --> 01:09:51,350
vatican door.
It makes me fucking sick.

1584
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:52,820
Wow.
All right.

1585
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:53,960
because you've got that there.

1586
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:55,790
There is a better can.
You can touch it.

1587
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:01,000
There is some now up disfigured gypsy 
woman who is 80 years old and has to 

1588
01:10:01,971 --> 01:10:06,971
sleep on a dirty cobblestone roman 
street every night while the church is 

1589
01:10:07,131 --> 01:10:10,010
right fucking there.
Wow.

1590
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,050
And they don't offer anythIng.
they don't take them in.

1591
01:10:12,051 --> 01:10:14,870
They don't feed them.
They'll help was disgusting.

1592
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:20,050
That's so strange.
You would think that you have to just 

1593
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:22,571
for show,
you couldn't even allow that just for 

1594
01:10:22,571 --> 01:10:24,500
show you got a main strip walk is only 
one strictly go do to go to the vatican.

1595
01:10:24,501 --> 01:10:29,501
That main fucking via that main strip 
and they're there and they're just the 

1596
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:31,420
most downtrodden,
repulsively,

1597
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:36,350
disgusting beggars you will ever see and
then you're at the doorsteps of the most

1598
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:40,850
opulent place in the world.
It's does my headi man so strange.

1599
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,520
It does my fucking hitting.
It's just so strange that they feel like

1600
01:10:43,521 --> 01:10:46,880
they could let those people be out front
and that'd be bad for business man.

1601
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:51,940
You would think so right now.
Apparently berlusconi when he came in 

1602
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:55,331
term selling bmws and just people park 
wrecked five bmw dealership.

1603
01:10:56,500 --> 01:11:01,500
Exactly.
The thing is that apparently someone 

1604
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:01,500
told me that since I've been there,
bill a scone,

1605
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,980
annie has cleaned up all the biggest and
the gypsies or move them,

1606
01:11:03,981 --> 01:11:08,030
but I want to know where do you move 
them to suddenly realize,

1607
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:09,050
hey,
people pages.

1608
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:14,090
That was lucky in beijing,
the olympic games because I commentated 

1609
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:14,700
the olympics in [inaudible].
Did you really do all the boxing and the

1610
01:11:14,701 --> 01:11:16,170
olympic games?
Wow.

1611
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:21,171
Fucking 272 fights in 10 days by myself.
Are you a big just by yourself,

1612
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:23,130
by myself.
Really fucking.

1613
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:26,550
You could talk about store my man word,
but you know,

1614
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:30,760
they relocated 1 million people.
1 million people.

1615
01:11:30,761 --> 01:11:34,500
1 million were relocated suddenly to 
build the ibc,

1616
01:11:34,501 --> 01:11:37,080
the international broadcast center for 
the media and the carpark.

1617
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:42,290
Oh,
1 million people lost their homes 

1618
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:42,290
virtually overnight.

1619
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:42,930
It's like they wake up one morning and 
they go,

1620
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:44,790
you're out of here.
That's insane.

1621
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:46,830
One mill.
How the fuck did they?

1622
01:11:46,831 --> 01:11:49,440
More than the entire population of san 
francisco.

1623
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:52,230
That's overnight.
Did you have no idea?

1624
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,500
After going to the olympic games and 
spending three weeks in beijing,

1625
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:59,430
I came back and I told everyone if the 
fucking chinese,

1626
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:04,490
everyone to take over the world,
they will do it in the space of a 

1627
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:05,460
fucking month,
the way they,

1628
01:12:05,461 --> 01:12:10,461
the amount of people that have and the 
organization they had and the manpower 

1629
01:12:10,461 --> 01:12:14,880
and the ability and the technology and 
having seen that in Japan as well,

1630
01:12:14,881 --> 01:12:16,680
that whole region,
Korea,

1631
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:18,300
Japan,
China,

1632
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:23,750
they will fucking take over the world 
easily in a month and we might as well 

1633
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:25,650
as bend over,
take the fucking rice up the ass and go,

1634
01:12:25,651 --> 01:12:29,040
okay,
we are your slaves because seriously,

1635
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,320
the olympic games was phenomenal.

1636
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:34,710
It was incredible.
What is it about them that makes them so

1637
01:12:34,711 --> 01:12:37,440
dangerous?
WhY is it their willingness to work hard

1638
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:39,390
in their life,
for their,

1639
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:44,420
for their job is their pride,
self pride and national pride do 

1640
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:48,230
willingness to work extremely hard for 
very little money and just for self 

1641
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:51,600
satisfaction and add to that,
the sheer number,

1642
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:54,570
the numbers they have,
the manpower is extraordinary.

1643
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:55,830
Did you go to one of those?
Yeah.

1644
01:12:55,831 --> 01:12:57,840
That is kind of training doWn level that
we can relate to.

1645
01:12:57,841 --> 01:13:02,841
You go to one of those k,
one shows in Japan and the amount of 

1646
01:13:02,841 --> 01:13:04,760
people they employed a set up the arena 
and set up the ring and the cameras.

1647
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:09,950
It is insane.
People that I see set up jobs for fox 

1648
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:11,910
sports back home that'll take two guys 
to set up a particular camera.

1649
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:15,120
we'll that.
We'll use 10 guys to set up a camera and

1650
01:13:15,121 --> 01:13:15,270
they'll.

1651
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:19,620
They'll get it done in like a quarter of
the time and the ring is taken apart not

1652
01:13:19,621 --> 01:13:22,890
by let's say a group of 15 people like a
show in Australia,

1653
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,860
but you'll get 300 guys that as soon as 
the show ends,

1654
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:31,010
they're coming in helmets and little 
cars and that ring is taken down in 10 

1655
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:31,010
minutes.
It's,

1656
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:35,320
it's like it's like it's like vultures 
going in and stripping the flesh for the

1657
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:40,610
dead animals is because they have so 
many people there that they work harder 

1658
01:13:40,610 --> 01:13:41,340
or like what is it?
So many people,

1659
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,430
they work hard but they worked 
diligently And they work together.

1660
01:13:44,610 --> 01:13:49,610
It's like it's like a colony of ants.
All the ants are pulling together for 

1661
01:13:49,610 --> 01:13:53,721
the colony.
No one aunt Is just on his own working 

1662
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:54,660
on his own agenda.
It's like we're all pulling together and

1663
01:13:54,661 --> 01:13:58,620
therefore we form one giant colony of 
just takeover wherever we want.

1664
01:13:58,621 --> 01:14:01,380
It's fucking amazing.
Scary.

1665
01:14:01,381 --> 01:14:02,180
It's amazing.
Well,

1666
01:14:02,181 --> 01:14:06,000
what they're able to do with getting 
people to work incredible hours and live

1667
01:14:06,001 --> 01:14:09,060
in dorms and shit.
That spookiest japanese.

1668
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:11,410
If you ever been inside of tokyo 
apartment,

1669
01:14:11,950 --> 01:14:12,190
this

1670
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:14,740
room here would be considered a fucking 
mansion.

1671
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:18,600
I want you to.
Renting a room in intake.

1672
01:14:18,601 --> 01:14:22,720
Your take your apartment.
The bid was in where the kitchen was,

1673
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,080
was in where the toilet was or the one 
big room.

1674
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:29,200
One big room where we have that here.
We have studios.

1675
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:31,360
you know you can get a studio.
That's basically,

1676
01:14:31,361 --> 01:14:33,090
that's it.
It's just a spot to live.

1677
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:38,190
From the end of the bed to the front 
door was from here to where that needs 

1678
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:38,190
on you.
Wow.

1679
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:40,480
That's how much room you had to move and
the stove is there,

1680
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,420
so you can literally target the worst 
hotel room ever voiced.

1681
01:14:43,421 --> 01:14:44,170
Telltale,
remember,

1682
01:14:44,171 --> 01:14:46,450
and then shrink it like rick mirena's,
honey,

1683
01:14:46,451 --> 01:14:50,410
I shrunk the hotel room down at.
He couldn't swing a cat in there.

1684
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:55,800
It's crazy.
I've seen some of the guys' apartments 

1685
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:58,021
when they show those clips for k one and
for dream and they used to do for pride 

1686
01:14:58,391 --> 01:15:02,000
where they show the guy's apartment and 
it showed where their training is.

1687
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:03,580
There's no room to do shit,
you know,

1688
01:15:03,581 --> 01:15:07,570
tiny ass gems to rob his gym where he 
trains oreo cookies.

1689
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:12,820
They fucking tiny.
And this little room over there that no 

1690
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:13,780
one.
Not many people have pets.

1691
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:18,840
What the fuck is it about people where 
we want to stack everybody on top of 

1692
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:18,940
each other like that?
What is that?

1693
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,320
I have no idea.
Is that good?

1694
01:15:20,321 --> 01:15:21,640
Is there something good about not used 
to it?

1695
01:15:21,641 --> 01:15:23,770
Because in Australia it's happening.
Yeah,

1696
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:25,730
I mean it happens in America.
It happens there.

1697
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:30,780
I mean there's in Australia,
everybody still leaves like you do here 

1698
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:34,020
in a house with a backyard in suburbs 
and the whole high rise apartment thing 

1699
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:38,700
is slowly building and popularity,
but still everywhere you look,

1700
01:15:40,230 --> 01:15:43,180
I'm telling you the west side highway 
drive is going to freak the fuck out,

1701
01:15:43,181 --> 01:15:44,690
but to everyone's stacked,
he kind of pet.

1702
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:48,670
Do you know you can go and rent a pet in
tokyo just to pick one too,

1703
01:15:48,671 --> 01:15:51,160
so you can go rent a cat or a dog for an
hour.

1704
01:15:51,161 --> 01:15:54,460
She can take it to the park,
throw a fucking little fucking park,

1705
01:15:54,461 --> 01:15:56,050
throw little frisbee,
feed it,

1706
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:58,020
take it for a walk.
Then you return it to the shop.

1707
01:15:58,390 --> 01:16:01,780
You rent a dog into cat for an hour.
That's ridiculous.

1708
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:04,990
What if you get attached to the dog?
Don't you develop a relationships in the

1709
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:09,991
dog?
Then you could maybe rent it for two 

1710
01:16:09,991 --> 01:16:09,991
hours,
but yeah,

1711
01:16:09,991 --> 01:16:09,991
you just rent a pen.
That's a strange world man.

1712
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:13,690
They almost are like an alien race.
So it really is.

1713
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:16,840
I mean the writing is so different,
so completely unrelated.

1714
01:16:17,070 --> 01:16:19,290
If you look at like the writing of,
you know,

1715
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:24,510
all the european countries except for 
the hungry a couple of days,

1716
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:26,680
they all share.

1717
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:28,840
They use the arabic alphabet that we 
use.

1718
01:16:28,841 --> 01:16:33,841
Yeah.
They all share it and you go to China 

1719
01:16:33,841 --> 01:16:33,841
and Korea and Japan.
It's like,

1720
01:16:33,841 --> 01:16:34,480
whoa,
you guys are aliens.

1721
01:16:34,481 --> 01:16:35,500
Yes.
This is alien stuff.

1722
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:40,530
This isn't even related to like this 
grew completely independent of the 

1723
01:16:40,530 --> 01:16:42,130
european style writing.
It's so different.

1724
01:16:42,190 --> 01:16:43,420
What a better world.
The place will be.

1725
01:16:43,421 --> 01:16:45,620
If everyone spoke one language,
would it?

1726
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:46,840
I don't know,
man.

1727
01:16:46,841 --> 01:16:51,841
I think it's cool to watch all the 
different branches now mad if people 

1728
01:16:52,481 --> 01:16:55,390
could actually reason with each other in
one single language,

1729
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:58,330
people would go to war over eichler 
people or retards.

1730
01:16:58,331 --> 01:17:00,120
All you have to this fucking blue odd 
cock suckers,

1731
01:17:00,121 --> 01:17:02,560
a church of god land dude.
People are dumb.

1732
01:17:02,561 --> 01:17:04,870
They find they want to be on teams.
No matter what.

1733
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:09,950
You always want to find him vent one 
universal language once wasn't suddenly 

1734
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:13,550
called esperanza or something like that 
might be someone can clarify on tweeted 

1735
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:13,550
towards.

1736
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:15,530
It was like years ago that tried to 
invent a language code.

1737
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:20,560
Esperanto esperanza,
it was meant to be one global language 

1738
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:20,930
and it never took off,
obviously.

1739
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:22,140
Don't remember that.
Yeah,

1740
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:27,190
yeah.
That would take a long ass time and you 

1741
01:17:27,190 --> 01:17:29,171
have to get it to the tribes and the 
african forest will take generations 

1742
01:17:29,171 --> 01:17:29,171
because you'd have to school 
generations,

1743
01:17:29,171 --> 01:17:31,400
three or four generations to get it down
pat and you know,

1744
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:33,220
income cultured among the masses.
Yeah.

1745
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:34,910
Most,
most countries in the world,

1746
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:40,000
you know,
a good percentage of the people are 

1747
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:40,000
bilingual and America.
People are,

1748
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:40,280
you know,
just english or spanish.

1749
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:41,200
That's it.
Yeah.

1750
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,610
Everyone's like english and I mean 
there's,

1751
01:17:43,611 --> 01:17:45,980
of course there's the immigrants in here
that speak all kinds of languages,

1752
01:17:45,981 --> 01:17:48,050
but as far as like people learning 
things,

1753
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:51,590
very few people are bilingual.
How bad the immigration problem here was

1754
01:17:51,591 --> 01:17:56,591
to.
I was driving to do a king of the cage 

1755
01:17:56,591 --> 01:17:58,511
show in New Mexico and the driver was 
telling me about it because we're 

1756
01:17:58,511 --> 01:17:58,511
driving along the border.

1757
01:17:58,511 --> 01:18:02,590
They're from el paso to mescalero and 
he's putting it out in my head was in 

1758
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:02,590
the van with me,
you know,

1759
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:07,301
and the guy's like,
this is where the mexicans from the 

1760
01:18:07,301 --> 01:18:07,301
border,
this is where they are on the border.

1761
01:18:07,301 --> 01:18:08,870
I'm being myself.
What the fuck they do you call if you're

1762
01:18:08,871 --> 01:18:10,780
complaining,
what the fuck do you call the state?

1763
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,790
New Mexico.
Seriously,

1764
01:18:13,791 --> 01:18:18,791
of course you're going to fucking run if
tHe old Mexico is shit and you want to 

1765
01:18:18,791 --> 01:18:22,211
you except I'm going to New Mexico.
Call it something else that doesn't 

1766
01:18:22,211 --> 01:18:24,770
matter what you call it over here.
There's money over here.

1767
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:26,600
I appreciate the ambition,
man.

1768
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:29,780
I think it's kind of fucked up that 
there's spots in the world that suck and

1769
01:18:29,781 --> 01:18:31,010
you can't leave him.
You know?

1770
01:18:31,011 --> 01:18:36,011
I think it's kind of fucked up that you 
can't just travel from one place to 

1771
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:36,011
another and just go wherever the fuck 
you want live.

1772
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:36,980
Where are you want?
You know,

1773
01:18:36,981 --> 01:18:38,570
we can't let them in.
We can't let them in.

1774
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:39,830
It's like,
really?

1775
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:44,850
You sure we carry brother.
I got held up in toronto for five days 

1776
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:48,581
recently because I had visa problems 
because something wasn't done properly 

1777
01:18:48,581 --> 01:18:48,581
on my,
my work visa,

1778
01:18:48,581 --> 01:18:51,530
so I've got held up in toronto and the 
way they treat you like you're a fucking

1779
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:52,850
liar,
you're a criminal,

1780
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:54,800
you fucking got to rag on your head and 
you're roddy.

1781
01:18:54,801 --> 01:18:59,801
I came with a bazooka.
Seriously because they're going to bed 

1782
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:00,340
like just.
I don't know what it was like.

1783
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:05,460
It could be an arab.
I felt like I was locked in a fucking 

1784
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:07,280
detention.
There was a lady studying you now.

1785
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:13,890
There was a french lady sitting there 
with three kids and she'd been in that 

1786
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:15,770
detention in toronto at the airport for 
four hours.

1787
01:19:15,771 --> 01:19:20,000
She was crying with the kids for four 
fucking hours.

1788
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,060
man would have her and her kids are 
strapped up with dynamite.

1789
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:24,100
Alrighty.
Everything about that?

1790
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:25,850
No,
no.

1791
01:19:26,050 --> 01:19:28,220
You gotta be fucking careful.
Their job is tough.

1792
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:30,460
I like our Canada doesn't let him douche
bags.

1793
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,720
They don't know.
What do you solve?

1794
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:32,720
Battery.
Fuck.

1795
01:19:32,721 --> 01:19:34,680
You get outta here and under blends 
high.

1796
01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:35,720
But,
you know,

1797
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:36,800
I think,
you know,

1798
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:39,140
I just think as long as you have a aware
of,

1799
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:44,141
you're aware of someone's record,
I think he should be able to go 

1800
01:19:44,141 --> 01:19:44,141
anywhere.
If you're not a murderer,

1801
01:19:44,141 --> 01:19:44,141
you know,
scumbag,

1802
01:19:44,141 --> 01:19:45,650
you have real papers.
If Mexico had real pampers,

1803
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:50,950
you know,
in America you do know you run numbers 

1804
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:50,950
on people in America,
chances are in 2010 you're going to know

1805
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:53,390
exactly what the fuck they've done.
boat people in Australia,

1806
01:19:53,391 --> 01:19:58,391
maN,
that'S how big problem people sailing 

1807
01:19:58,391 --> 01:19:59,951
boats from East Timor and other places 
that ruck up on boats in Australia and 

1808
01:19:59,951 --> 01:20:01,160
they run off into the fucking jungle.
Fuck.

1809
01:20:01,161 --> 01:20:02,330
Yeah,
because Australia is awesome.

1810
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,890
Well scott,
I appreciate that.

1811
01:20:03,891 --> 01:20:08,891
I mean,
it's like why shouldn't they be able to 

1812
01:20:08,891 --> 01:20:08,891
do that?
There are people,

1813
01:20:08,891 --> 01:20:08,891
I feel like if you

1814
01:20:08,891 --> 01:20:13,550
have the means and the willpower to get 
somewhere that's better than where 

1815
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:13,550
you're at,
we should all allow that.

1816
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:15,210
You know what kind of fucking hippy 
commie,

1817
01:20:15,211 --> 01:20:20,211
socialist talk nonsense is this boy,
this is America land of the free home of

1818
01:20:20,251 --> 01:20:22,560
the brave.
And I'm here with Australia.

1819
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:25,170
My man michael chavela.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1820

the meeting of the minds.
