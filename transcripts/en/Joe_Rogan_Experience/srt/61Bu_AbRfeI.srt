1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:01,441
Uh,

3
00:00:01,441 --> 00:00:02,274
the,

4
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:03,300
yeah.

5
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,760
Hey everybody,

6
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,790
the Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the fleshlight.

7
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,400
If you go to Joe Rogan Dalton [inaudible],

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,370

9
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:14,760
Rogan,

10
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,790
you will get 15% often
number one sex toy for men.

11
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,670
And then you can watch
pornography with it.

12
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:23,730
And then you shoot your little loads
in it and you're all happy now.

13
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,290
Aren't you happy?

14
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,380
Buckle up bitches.

15
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,300
Tom [inaudible] in the house.

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,580
All my girls back.

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,320
[inaudible]

18
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,880
Shizam bitches.

19
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,373
Welcome back.

20
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,750
Welcome back to a Garosa.

21
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:49,141
Yo,

22
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:49,710
what's up brother?

23
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,460
What's up man?

24
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,300
It's good to have you buddy.

25
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:51,941
Thanks for having me,

26
00:00:51,941 --> 00:00:52,060
man.

27
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,070
We're going to be doing the Ice
House in Pasadena this weekend.

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,210
Um,

29
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:57,601
so it's,

30
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:58,411
it's a fun place,

31
00:00:58,411 --> 00:00:58,740
man.

32
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,630
That's the one of those old school places.

33
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:03,840
I think they've been open for
30 years now or something crazy.

34
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,260
Yeah,

35
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,040
they've uh,

36
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,790
they've been opened over,

37
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,330
I think,

38
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,620
don't they claim to be the oldest?

39
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:08,454
How many classes?

40
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,780
I think they might be,

41
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:10,580
it's them and light.

42
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,110
Then the comedy and Magic Club
is regret up in there too.

43
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:13,770
Yeah.

44
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,730
And then the store I think,

45
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,140
but if you go there,

46
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,570
it's one of those places that has like,

47
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,750
it's a like a fucking comedy museum
as well as a standup comic clearly.

48
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:22,951
Cool.

49
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:23,671
That's the coolest part.

50
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:23,970
Yeah,

51
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,810
because you're walking around and you
see headshots from like the 70s man,

52
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,890
the head shots when the ATS tracks.

53
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,993
Yeah.

54
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,000
I saw a David Letterman and contract
last time I was there and his social

55
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:37,590
security numbers on it,

56
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,080
but it'll cover like by
the frame and I'm like,

57
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:40,321
damn,

58
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:43,530
if you really wanted David
Letterman social security
now or you would just steal

59
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:45,930
this picture and break that
frame you just gave somebody.

60
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:46,770
Wow,

61
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,750
why did you get some back?

62
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,880
Did you bring that up to
us before the podcast?

63
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:51,301
And we say,

64
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:51,511
yeah,

65
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,950
maybe we shouldn't talk
about that on the air.

66
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:53,400
And you go,

67
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:53,641
yeah,

68
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:54,331
I guess you're right.

69
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:56,000
Well you got to talk to the Ice House.

70
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,170
I'll be there tomorrow night.

71
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,341
Tickets on sale,

72
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:00,780
free coupon code on Twitter.

73
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,651
They have other kinds.

74
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:02,850
They didn't alternate it at all.

75
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,450
They didn't,

76
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,160
I don't know.

77
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,440
They,

78
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,100
they might have,

79
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,600
but I was looking at it and I was like,

80
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:07,081
Holy Shit,

81
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:08,340
why is that just sitting there?

82
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:08,670
Right.

83
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,120
Like,

84
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,070
that seems like they
would know that by now,

85
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:11,670
you know,

86
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,503
it has to be altered.

87
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,560
I must be altered,

88
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,453
I would assume.

89
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,020
Hopefully Jesus Christ,

90
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:18,210
I'm just a crook looking at a
fucking headshots and I'm like,

91
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:18,810
wow.

92
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,580
They busted a bunch of
those anonymous cats,

93
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:20,940
Huh?

94
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,301
Yeah.

95
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:22,134
Shitload of them.

96
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,550
Some in California too.

97
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,230
And what do they charge them with?

98
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,551
I don't know.

99
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:28,640
That's like cyber terrorism
or something like that.

100
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:28,810
That,

101
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,220
that's,

102
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,550
yeah,

103
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:29,861
that's,

104
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:30,840
that's hardcore federal.

105
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,880
What did they do exactly?

106
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,280
I know they went after companies that
thought were bad and they hacked pay

107
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:37,651
power.

108
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:38,371
I think they did.

109
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:41,100
Or they fucked with paypal
somehow and I can't remember.

110
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,810
And they like started taking people's pay
pals and like buying things on Amazon.

111
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:46,120
Like,

112
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,310
but it was all fun stuff.

113
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:50,620
Like they would buy like diapers to the
right person or something like that.

114
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,900
And uh,

115
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,411
things like that.

116
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:53,970
But it was hacking paypal,

117
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:56,550
which I guess can be considered
like a bank or something like that.

118
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,900
So that would be a federal crime,

119
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,760
I would imagine.

120
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,290
Yeah,

121
00:02:59,290 --> 00:02:59,921
they're fucked,

122
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:00,250
Huh?

123
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:00,760
Yeah.

124
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,230
You're getting real
trouble for that shit now.

125
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:05,050
I guess cybercrime is legit now.

126
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,040
It's like terrorism.

127
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,380
Like remember they used to
not have laws for this stuff.

128
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,830
Like cause it didn't like when people
would do things like this for the first

129
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:13,080
time and people would,

130
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:13,923
they would get like,

131
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,680
we don't really have a law
yet for breaking into this
type of account cause they

132
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:22,570
didn't know their shit existed so
they had to pass all these laws.

133
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:25,030
We still have to pass laws for new crimes.

134
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:25,840
You know what I mean?

135
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,200
Technology allows for new
crimes that take place.

136
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:29,960
Yeah,

137
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,550
yeah.

138
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,761
Yeah.

139
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:32,140
Crimes that didn't exist before.

140
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:34,030
They weren't possible for you.

141
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:38,020
Remember when they first started using
those things over the phone when they

142
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:42,280
would have tones that you could call
Andy and use over the phone and it would

143
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:43,390
like hack the phones.

144
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,000
What the fuck was that?

145
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:45,740
Yeah.

146
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,040
What,

147
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,290
how,

148
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,020
how did that work?

149
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,980
I can't even remember.

150
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:48,730
I don't,

151
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,040
I never,

152
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,980
something you could do to a phone by
sending a tone through it and that certain

153
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:57,160
tone would interact with the
machine on the other side.

154
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:59,230
And I don't know what the fuck
that it allowed you to do,

155
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,240
but just the fact that
somebody figured that out,

156
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:01,580
man.

157
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:01,990
Yeah.

158
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,340
People are so creepy.

159
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:03,840
There's,

160
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,070
they'll try to exploit every little,

161
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:06,371
you know,

162
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:06,571
and,

163
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:07,780
and any little system,

164
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,210
there's gotta be some way
to make money off this.

165
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,800
That's why I see somewhere to hack it.

166
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,350
Security never becomes
foolproof because yeah,

167
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,420
when you develop a new security system,

168
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,970
it becomes someone's
mission to break that.

169
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:21,600
So then you just make it as good as it
can be and then you have to evolve that.

170
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,650
But you kind of need those guys though,

171
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,570
because if you don't have those guys,

172
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:29,410
you don't have any realistic
sense of how secure your data is.

173
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:29,950
Oh yeah.

174
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,221
You know,

175
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:32,710
you need some fucking psychos
going after your shit,

176
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,600
you know?

177
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,560
If psychos go off to your website,

178
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,430
then you then,

179
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:36,910
you know,

180
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:37,660
then you know,

181
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,160
because you can't just
have your employees.

182
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:39,520
Well,

183
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,860
we're going to test it from the
outside and see if we can whack in.

184
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,340
Nah,

185
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,420
you don't have enough motivation.

186
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:44,000
Stupid.

187
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,260
Yeah.

188
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,940
You need to be hating the government.

189
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:51,030
Did you tweet that article about the
guy who is going to prison now for like

190
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,190
life or something for
hacking his neighbors?

191
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:54,880
Yeah,

192
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,080
he's going for 18 years.

193
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:56,470
Well this,

194
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,810
he was terrorizing the family.

195
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,810
He is a crazy,

196
00:04:58,811 --> 00:04:59,630
amazing story.

197
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,463
Pharrell story.

198
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,570
You hear shit about that.

199
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,411
It's scary.

200
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:03,011
Scary story.

201
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:03,844
We can just do that.

202
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,760
That's terrible.

203
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,840
I think as a business,

204
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:08,570
the only way to protect herself
from like these like hacks,

205
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:09,980
like anonymous and stuff like that.

206
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:12,920
It's just to have a shitload
of cats on your website,

207
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:13,551
you know?

208
00:05:13,551 --> 00:05:16,940
So if it's like wells Fargo Bank just
put cats all over the place cause I think

209
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,640
that's how crazy this shit is.

210
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:21,170
Like do this anonymous and stuff is,

211
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,340
it seems like they're only
attacking people and unless you're,

212
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:25,520
you don't get the Internet,

213
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:25,970
you know,

214
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:26,751
it's almost like,

215
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:26,991
hey,

216
00:05:26,991 --> 00:05:30,180
if you like cats and if you're
like piracy and torrents and,

217
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,310
and shit like that,

218
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,350
then you're on our side.

219
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:33,184
But if you're,

220
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,630
it's almost like it's like a gang,

221
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,190
like an internet gang,

222
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:37,840
you know?

223
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,540
What are you saying?

224
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,390
I don't know.

225
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,293
Understand why shame.

226
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,610
It's connections to like,

227
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,060
uh,

228
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,960
four Chan as,

229
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,700
as an example and things like that.

230
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:46,511
Even if it's not,

231
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:48,790
they're not on in four Chan or whatever.

232
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,421
Like it's four.

233
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:50,440
Chan supports them.

234
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,120
Yeah.

235
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,690
And then,

236
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,290
and then Lil Louis,

237
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,190
Louis sac or with low sacrad
like supports a anonymous,

238
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,260
almost like it.

239
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,060
You just almost have to be in some kind
of gang and just have a lot of cats on

240
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:02,840
your website,

241
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,830
I think to protect you.

242
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,380
And what is the cats on the website?

243
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,611
Because that's like saying,

244
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:07,881
Hey,

245
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:08,280
I,

246
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,470
I'm on the Internet too.

247
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:14,120
I like cats and hamburgers and what
the fuck are you talking about?

248
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,411
You,

249
00:06:14,411 --> 00:06:16,160
you really need to go to a doctor.

250
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,430
If you think anything in that
sentence when they sentence,

251
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:20,420
you need to go to a doctor.

252
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,320
I did not follow.

253
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,820
All right.

254
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,653
You want me to explain it?

255
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,030
No,

256
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:23,181
no,

257
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:23,541
no.

258
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,374
Definitely not.

259
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,420
The thing that,

260
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:26,721
no,

261
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:27,554
let's move on from that.

262
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,180
Fuck.

263
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,801
Are you dog?

264
00:06:28,801 --> 00:06:30,040
You can't.

265
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,980
The thing the best.

266
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:31,880
I know what you're saying though,

267
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:34,760
that it seems like they're in kind
of a gang and it does seem like,

268
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,061
sorry,

269
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,290
I honestly didn't follow,

270
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,150
I'm sorry.

271
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:37,983
All right.

272
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,961
You know the Internet,

273
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:41,600
what's popular on the internet
caps and hats and shit like that.

274
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,790
Like a cat's really that
popular on the Internet.

275
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,121
Fuck.

276
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:44,310
Yeah.

277
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,030
It's like it's porn cats.

278
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,243
Real business.

279
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,240
Is this what happened to
Egypt when Egypt went down?

280
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,813
Cat Worship.

281
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,390
They got to look at us the same way.

282
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:53,961
You know,

283
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:55,490
maybe this is what cat worship is.

284
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,600
If you looked around
people's fucking houses,

285
00:06:57,601 --> 00:06:58,650
are those your cat?

286
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:58,781
Well,

287
00:06:58,781 --> 00:07:00,070
your thing that you have with the,

288
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:01,790
the cat with the dynamite on it.

289
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,560
Yeah.

290
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,530
That lucky cat.

291
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,560
How many porcelain cats are
all throughout people's homes?

292
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:06,860
Huh?

293
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,720
There's a lot of Williams.

294
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:07,970
Yeah.

295
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,020
There's a lot if you like,

296
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,120
if archeologists came
here from the future,

297
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:11,511
they'd be like,

298
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:11,961
they might say,

299
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:16,961
well they were this weird cat worshiping
group of fucking ran environmentally

300
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:18,020
conscious freaks.

301
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:18,660
Yeah.

302
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,493
Cats are running shit.

303
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,040
And then they would find out about the
toxo plasma shit and they would make some

304
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,600
half ass hypothesis that the reason why
we were so fascinated with cats as we

305
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:27,890
all had toxo.

306
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,520
Sure.

307
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:28,851
That's true.

308
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:30,110
And that's what made us all go crazy.

309
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,220
Do you think that we uh,

310
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:31,760
wrong,

311
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,230
like,

312
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,660
uh,

313
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,620
inaccurately,

314
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,460
uh,

315
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,120
get an idea of like
past civilizations like,

316
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,113
Oh,

317
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,191
you have to be right?

318
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:40,970
Like where you're like,

319
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,110
here's what they used to do.

320
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:42,980
Well,

321
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,250
in my mind,

322
00:07:44,251 --> 00:07:44,640
man,

323
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,570
thousand years ago,

324
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,750
what fucks my mind is shit like sue mayor
because there's only a fucking handful

325
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:54,930
of people who can read that shit.

326
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,280
That's cuneiform.

327
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:57,240
I think it's called.

328
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,940
And it's these weird lines and man,

329
00:07:59,941 --> 00:08:02,310
it takes forever to translate that shit.

330
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,350
And there's a lot of discrepancies.

331
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,501
It's,

332
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:07,320
that's why that whole
Zechariah Cichon movement,

333
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,340
if you're not aware of that,

334
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:08,930
this is,

335
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:09,171
you know,

336
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:10,410
the Zechariah snitching Shit,

337
00:08:10,411 --> 00:08:10,880
right?

338
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,713
That's that.

339
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,540
He believes that in his
study of the Sumerian texts,

340
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,810
this guy was like a legit
scholar on ancient languages.

341
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,640
And he believed that his,

342
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,800
through his study of the
ancient Sumerian texts,

343
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:26,790
he believed that it was a detailed account
of how the human beings were created

344
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,030
by an advanced intellect
called the Annunaki.

345
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,000
And that they mixed their DNA with us.

346
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,021
And he says,

347
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:36,120
this is all in this ancient text.

348
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,560
And it's very disputed.

349
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,120
There's a lot of people
that don't agree with them,

350
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:41,250
a lot of like mainstream,

351
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:41,940
you know,

352
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,500
scholars from that era.

353
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,520
They don't agree with them.

354
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,600
But this guy stuck to
his fucking guns and,

355
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:48,030
and he,

356
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:52,860
he believed that the entire
human race was created by these,

357
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,221
you know,

358
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:57,150
these things called the Annunaki
and this is all written down.

359
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:02,250
What really fucks my mind is whether or
not that's what they wrote down or what,

360
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,140
who knows what crazy person wrote?

361
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,250
Whatever you're reading,

362
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:05,810
you know,

363
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,670
what you're reading doesn't
necessarily represent the whole world.

364
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,610
What if you stumbled onto a pile
of ancient Stephen King books?

365
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:12,061
You know,

366
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:12,331
I mean,

367
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:15,960
who the fuck knows who the fuck knows
what exactly you're reading when,

368
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,500
but it's,

369
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,220
it fucks my mind that you can
go that far back with people.

370
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,610
It's like you can really trace progress,

371
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,490
but things get lost
somewhere along the way.

372
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,380
And there's a few places where it's like,

373
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,150
they'll just stumble on some shit and go,

374
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:30,451
whoa,

375
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:30,661
whoa,

376
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:30,931
Whoa,

377
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:31,410
whoa.

378
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,400
Where'd this come from?

379
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,210
Troy?

380
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,770
You mean Troy is real?

381
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,120
This is a real city.

382
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:36,811
What the fuck?

383
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:38,310
Now recently Atlantis,

384
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,500
they found Atlantis in Spain.

385
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:40,630
They,

386
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,760
they're almost positive.

387
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:43,620
It has the concentric rings.

388
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:44,790
It looks just like it.

389
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:45,960
It's in the right area.

390
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:46,480
And they,

391
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,280
there's all the illy.

392
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:47,611
Yeah,

393
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:48,060
there's,

394
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,893
there's also,

395
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,860
um,

396
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,220
there's,

397
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,220
there's also some interesting evidence
that there was a models of Atlantis that

398
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:56,850
resembled this,

399
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,481
this place,

400
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:02,130
and they had been passed down like in
the images so closely matched and had all

401
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:05,940
these symbols in it represented
like symbols of Atlantis.

402
00:10:05,941 --> 00:10:07,740
And it's just way too close.

403
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:10,170
Like a lot of scholars are
getting on board with this.

404
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:11,040
They think they found it.

405
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,290
So that's like so much shit is there.

406
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,020
They're always finding ancient shit.

407
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,050
It's like the civilization
has gone so fucking far,

408
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:24,030
but we can't really follow
it in a straight line.

409
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:24,510
No,

410
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,670
but especially after like
before a certain time.

411
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:26,970
Yeah.

412
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,550
When you can't like 2000 BC.

413
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,450
Oh Man,

414
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:30,990
son.

415
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,370
How long ago was that?

416
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,221
And you notice,

417
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:33,780
you know,

418
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,670
when those things get
like really old ones,

419
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:36,210
they get like,

420
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:36,541
they're like,

421
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,580
this is a civilization.

422
00:10:37,581 --> 00:10:40,590
It's 40,000 years old and they,

423
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,070
they'll,

424
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:41,520
they'll,

425
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:41,761
you know,

426
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,230
they'll read something on the wall.

427
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,130
They never,

428
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:44,670
uh,

429
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,580
I take into account the
possibility that it's art.

430
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,803
It's always like,

431
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,261
they're like,

432
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:50,280
this is the document,

433
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:55,310
this is like documentation showing that
they loved whales and that they would

434
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,820
fuck here and talked to the son
here and then eat the whale.

435
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,650
Now this is what they did in their day.

436
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:02,311
And you go,

437
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:05,400
but what if it was just
somebody painting or drawing?

438
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,630
Like they never,

439
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,830
that's never really a pull when
human beings first figured out how to

440
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:14,640
communicate for sure right away
they started lying right away.

441
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:15,030
Right.

442
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,421
I mean,

443
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:17,820
as soon as they realize they can
lie and get away with things.

444
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,590
And then you don't get
in trouble for stuff.

445
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:19,861
It was,

446
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:21,390
people just started lying for sure.

447
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,171
It's just,

448
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:24,420
it has to be old as fuck.

449
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,350
It seems like just an
inherent like escape door in,

450
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:29,250
in consciousness,

451
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,020
the ability to communicate but then give
deceptive communication and fuck with

452
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:34,740
other people.

453
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,830
So from,

454
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,140
from right away people were probably
untrustworthy and especially in their

455
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:41,700
depictions of the past,

456
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,070
especially when they're talking
about like things that happened.

457
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:44,281
I mean,

458
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:45,114
Jesus Christ,

459
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,890
everybody knows that the winners
write the history books and you know,

460
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,420
back then the history books
were written on animal skins.

461
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,230
You know,

462
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,190
who the fuck,

463
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,130
what really

464
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:54,963
happened?

465
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:55,391
You know,

466
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:55,721
it's like,

467
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:57,610
it's very shady at best and you don't,

468
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,910
you never portray yourself really
in a negative lab or shameful.

469
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,120
Yeah,

470
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,571
no one's,

471
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:02,410
no one's a bad guy.

472
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,060
If it's you,

473
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,631
I mean it's,

474
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:05,920
I mean that's of course there's,

475
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,221
you know,

476
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:09,040
different cultures and have different
depictions of the steam store and you can

477
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,680
kind of extrapolate from all
those who's probably got it right.

478
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,450
But it's a lot of gray area,

479
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:14,110
man.

480
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:14,950
She was talking about,

481
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:15,131
you know,

482
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:18,400
thousands and thousands of years ago and
then they constantly have to move the

483
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:19,234
date.

484
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,470
They found that place in Turkey
recently over the last decade or so,

485
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:28,471
I believe it's called go Beckley and it
predates anything by like 5,000 years.

486
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:31,390
It's like 12 13,000 years old.

487
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,020
Yeah,

488
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,920
no like fuck.

489
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,290
Like we didn't even think
people were making shit by,

490
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:35,680
yeah,

491
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,470
they thought that back then people
were just strictly hunter gatherers,

492
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,950
so there's all sorts of light and they
don't know that anything about that

493
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:42,310
culture.

494
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,551
They're like,

495
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:43,211
what is this?

496
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:43,870
You know,

497
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,500
why do they have lizards on there on
these rocks that they've carved out these

498
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:50,740
giant columns with lizards on me
and this one's got a sheep on it.

499
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:51,670
What the fuck were they doing?

500
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,980
Just all the stuff for the,

501
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,060
what is this?

502
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,510
The lines of Nascar I've ever seen,

503
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:57,941
man,

504
00:12:57,941 --> 00:13:02,941
dude may trip and there are so enormous,

505
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:03,791
the whole thing.

506
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:04,031
I mean,

507
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:06,130
I know that this is obviously
what everyone says about it,

508
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:09,070
but it really blows your
mind when you think about it.

509
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,450
The only way you could see what
you're doing is if you're in the air.

510
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,640
There's no other way to see how well
you did this and these things are so old

511
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,130
that like how is,

512
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,310
how could you check it out?

513
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:22,130
I mean the,

514
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:22,963
the,

515
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,210
the lines are as wide as roads.

516
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:25,721
Yeah,

517
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,560
the roads.

518
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,040
Yeah.

519
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,640
Wide earns.

520
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,300
Perfect.

521
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:29,740
Yeah.

522
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,760
Perfect lines.

523
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,490
And the only way like you see crop,

524
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:34,480
like they do it on farms,

525
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:34,721
right?

526
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:35,860
Like they'll do like fun things,

527
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:37,690
but the only way they're
seeing what they're doing,

528
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:42,691
if somebody is in a plane and radioing
like now here drive six yards.

529
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,110
Well the guys who make the crop
circles don't have to do that.

530
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,910
The guys who make the crop circles,

531
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,750
what they figured out how to do is
they just mark some numbers down.

532
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:53,730
They figured out like distance.

533
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:54,071
He's like,

534
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:54,880
this is God.

535
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,090
They call themselves a circle makers
and they've shown that you can make

536
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,983
certain,

537
00:13:59,140 --> 00:13:59,411
you know,

538
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:01,960
certain pretty intricate grab circles.

539
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,730
But what's amazing about this is
we know that there's air flight.

540
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:11,200
Now we know that people are going to see
these crop circles mean if people made

541
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:13,150
these things for fun or for High Jinks,

542
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,740
if that's why they're
making these crop circles,

543
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:15,760
these beautiful designs,

544
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,631
just to make people go,

545
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:16,771
Whoa,

546
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:17,350
what the fuck?

547
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,150
We know that people are going
to see him from a plane.

548
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,630
So the idea that these can
only be seen from the sky,

549
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,790
it's like who are you making them for?

550
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:25,180
Right.

551
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,380
And the fact that there thousands
and thousands of years old,

552
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,300
it's the point where they
don't really know exactly.

553
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:31,661
Is that,

554
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:32,680
do we not even know?

555
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,460
They don't really know.

556
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:33,701
No,

557
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:34,451
they don't know why.

558
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:35,111
They don't know who.

559
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:36,370
They don't know what it symbolizes.

560
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,160
They don't know if the fucking
mountain was flattened out.

561
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:39,994
By the way,

562
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,120
do you know there's an area where the
Nazca lines is that it looks like it was

563
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:44,050
fucking excavate.

564
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:44,500
Excavate,

565
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,460
excavated.

566
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,240
Excuse me.

567
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,560
It looks like it was excavated.

568
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:49,060
It looks like it was flattened out.

569
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,710
It looks like it was sculpted.

570
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:51,290
It looks,

571
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,280
it was worked

572
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,570
on by machines.

573
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,130
I don't know if it was,

574
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:00,550
but I wouldn't be fucking completely
surprised that there wasn't some very

575
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:05,870
sophisticated level of humanity at one
point in time that died off and dropped

576
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:06,500
back.

577
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:06,741
You know?

578
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:08,690
I don't know if they were
ever as far as we were,

579
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,280
but who knows,

580
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:10,730
man,

581
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,050
when you see shit like that,

582
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,770
there might have been some people flying
fucking planes three or 4,000 years

583
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:15,981
ago.

584
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:16,970
That might've been real.

585
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,840
That could be,

586
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,673
it might be.

587
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:19,581
It might be.

588
00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:19,771
It's,

589
00:15:19,771 --> 00:15:20,720
it's fucking why.

590
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:20,990
Well,

591
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,460
why else would they draw those things,

592
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:22,821
man?

593
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:23,810
Why would they do that?

594
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,740
They're incredible.

595
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,640
Giant,

596
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,580
massive and that,

597
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:26,781
yeah,

598
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:26,970
it's,

599
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,430
what's the purpose from this guy?

600
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:29,800
You're supposed to look
at it from the sky.

601
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,200
You,

602
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,410
you know you're doing it just for the
satisfaction of knowing that someone can

603
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:34,880
look at it from this guy really,

604
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:37,790
and this is going to be like a common
practice in a place where it looks like

605
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,800
there's runways and it's also,

606
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:41,180
it's not only you have
to see from this guy,

607
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,010
it's out of the way in the sky.

608
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,410
Like that shit is way out of the way.

609
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,281
Maybe back then?

610
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:46,491
No,

611
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:48,380
you didn't really understand life.

612
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,310
So you're like,

613
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,550
I know there's something up
there that it storms on us.

614
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,150
We,

615
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,020
we've heard thunder.

616
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,870
I'm going to make a sign
to a piece to the god,

617
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:57,351
you know,

618
00:15:57,351 --> 00:15:59,030
so you might be not like a plane,

619
00:15:59,031 --> 00:15:59,740
but it's more like a,

620
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,570
like a ritual for stability.

621
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,470
Absolutely.

622
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:03,801
Sure.

623
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:04,640
That's possible.

624
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,160
Like the,

625
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,540
you have to consider more
as the straight lines.

626
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,890
They're looking like runways.

627
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,360
They're all over the place up there.

628
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,110
Huge.

629
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,300
It looks like God Damn Logan Airport.

630
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,200
That's what it looks like.

631
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,033
It looks like an airport.

632
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,240
Like there's all these runways.

633
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,370
What's those big statues that ha like
we're big rectangles that had their mouths

634
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,213
open.

635
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:22,641
Uh,

636
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:23,750
and they had like a,

637
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:26,630
you know what I'm talking about it and
they used it in a gratis video game

638
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,003
island.

639
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,430
East islands.

640
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:30,750
Yeah,

641
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,171
yeah,

642
00:16:31,171 --> 00:16:31,610
yeah.

643
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,510
Well that's a trip to,

644
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,171
yeah,

645
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:34,130
that's a mean.

646
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:34,881
Tasha is awesome.

647
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:35,600
They really,

648
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:35,920
they,

649
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,800
they struggled to figure out how they
move those stones thousands and thousands

650
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:39,801
of years ago.

651
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:40,551
How they cut them so.

652
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:41,120
Well,

653
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,560
Machu Picchu is like that too.

654
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:42,920
Yeah.

655
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,780
Like those stones

656
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,810
or no shit.

657
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:51,290
Like the size of like the wall behind
you and they lay in to another stone like

658
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:52,584
this.

659
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:52,921
They're like,

660
00:16:52,921 --> 00:16:57,570
you can't slide a piece of
paper between them and you go,

661
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,280
you look at these like boulders.

662
00:16:59,281 --> 00:17:00,114
Basically.

663
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:00,960
They're smooth.

664
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,261
They're like,

665
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:02,094
they're shaped.

666
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,301
They're massive.

667
00:17:03,301 --> 00:17:07,260
So you go like this would take hundreds
of people and then how would you get it

668
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:10,740
to fit into the next rock where it
looks like they're made for each other?

669
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,400
Yeah.

670
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,150
It's unbelievable.

671
00:17:13,151 --> 00:17:14,130
It's pretty deep shit.

672
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:14,651
Yeah.

673
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:15,600
And you see how a la,

674
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,111
I've been there.

675
00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:17,940
I've been there three times to that place.

676
00:17:17,941 --> 00:17:18,774
Too much a patriot.

677
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,260
Really?

678
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,093
Yeah.

679
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,200
Is it cold trip?

680
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:21,711
Like is it,

681
00:17:21,711 --> 00:17:23,480
would you recommend going
as it like a vacation?

682
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,580
Literally blow your mind every time.

683
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,600
Every time.

684
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,231
What does it like,

685
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:28,310
what does it feel like
when you're up there?

686
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:28,790
Isn't it?

687
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,151
First of all,

688
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:31,060
it wasn't like 10,000
feet above sea level.

689
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,641
Something crazy.

690
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:32,690
I don't think it's that high up.

691
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,070
It's that mean it's in the Andes.

692
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:34,620
You,

693
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,780
you fly to,

694
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,460
to Cusco in the south of Peru and
then you take a train from Cusco to,

695
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:43,671
by the way,

696
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:46,280
if I was a single girl and
you're telling me all this,

697
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:47,210
I'd be so attracted to,

698
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,670
I feel like he's a man of the world

699
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,390
and has been done match you,

700
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:51,700
Pete,

701
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,021
chewy.

702
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:52,801
So amazing.

703
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:55,870
I think I can get them to go
vegan and he recommended Amarillo.

704
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,753
That'd be like

705
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:57,761
the Fart Porn,

706
00:17:57,761 --> 00:17:59,950
the 7,900 feet above sea level.

707
00:17:59,951 --> 00:18:01,010
That's where up man.

708
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,290
And they have no idea how
old that shit is either.

709
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,940
Right now they have estimations for that.

710
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:09,910
I mean it was definitely discovered by a,

711
00:18:09,911 --> 00:18:10,390
they,

712
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,960
they,

713
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,050
I think they said that they were there
in the fifties and sixties they think it

714
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:14,884
was been one,

715
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,630
I think it was 1560s you know,

716
00:18:16,631 --> 00:18:18,710
that's one of those
disputed ones with 'em,

717
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,020
that Graham Hancock Guy,

718
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:23,380
and I know a lot of people are this
or pseudo science and he's the guy,

719
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,600
the guy that predates all these.

720
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:27,190
I'm like structures.

721
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:30,100
Like he's got a thing on the
Great Sphinx with this other guy,

722
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:35,110
a doctor Robert Schoch out of a University
of Massachusetts or Boston University

723
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:36,514
rather,

724
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,610
and they think that the Sphinx is like
thousands and thousands of years older

725
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:40,660
than everybody thinks it is.

726
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,180
Then conventionally
Egyptologists claiming as well,

727
00:18:43,181 --> 00:18:43,351
he's,

728
00:18:43,351 --> 00:18:47,210
he's also got a thing about Macha Picchu
that they think at one time match beach

729
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,110
who was actually on the
shores of some water.

730
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:50,980
Really?

731
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,191
Yeah.

732
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:55,060
That it was on the shores of a river
or a lake or an ocean or something like

733
00:18:55,061 --> 00:18:55,330
that.

734
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,550
It is stunning it.

735
00:18:57,551 --> 00:18:58,150
Fuck.

736
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,990
The thing is like,

737
00:18:58,991 --> 00:19:03,260
it really puts in like this is true about
everything that the magnitude and like

738
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,570
the greatness of something,

739
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,790
you can't measure it.

740
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,800
It doesn't matter how many
videos or photos used to see it.

741
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,180
It's like it's whether,

742
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:10,511
you know,

743
00:19:10,511 --> 00:19:14,970
it's like seeing a band live or seeing
a person who's like just has some

744
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,960
same Thompson Garner the
ice house this weekend,

745
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,451
Friday,

746
00:19:17,451 --> 00:19:19,110
Saturday night show,

747
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:20,420
sold out both nights pitches.

748
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,520
Did you tag the statues?

749
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,061
What's that?

750
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,250
Did you tag the statues?

751
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:24,750
Yeah.

752
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:24,980
Yeah,

753
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,720
yeah,

754
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,020
sure.

755
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,260
Area.

756
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,970
You suggested today ever dear cool.

757
00:19:28,971 --> 00:19:30,230
About a PD on those things?

758
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,340
Oh yeah,

759
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,100
I'm sure.

760
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,050
Want to see graffiti?

761
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,060
Have you seen graffiti?

762
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,163
That's cool.

763
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:35,610
Yeah.

764
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:35,840
Dude,

765
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,070
that's like a safe place.

766
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,933
That'd be awful.

767
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,980
So tell us a story.

768
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm sorry you got,

769
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,970
I'm just making fun of you being
so attractive with your knowledge.

770
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,610
You get in a bus or a train
and you get somewhere.

771
00:19:46,611 --> 00:19:47,840
So how does it go?

772
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,391
Yeah.

773
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:49,680
What you fly into Cusco,

774
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,750
which is way up,

775
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,171
uh,

776
00:19:51,171 --> 00:19:52,110
up in the,

777
00:19:52,111 --> 00:19:52,581
in the mountain.

778
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:53,540
This is all in Peru.

779
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,020
In Peru.

780
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,620
Yeah.

781
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,610
So when you,

782
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,660
when you arrive in Cusco,

783
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:58,490
you're up high already.

784
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:03,510
Cusco is pretty high up in the mountains
and you get like powerful headaches,

785
00:20:03,651 --> 00:20:03,861
you know,

786
00:20:03,861 --> 00:20:06,350
headaches you getting in
like high altitude places.

787
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,300
Uh,

788
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:07,730
but I,

789
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,470
I'm pretty sure it's higher than like,

790
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,753
you know,

791
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,120
uh,

792
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,490
Tahoe or any place like
that where you're like,

793
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,001
oh man,

794
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:14,180
like,

795
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,900
like a head hurts cause you
have serious oxygen deprivation.

796
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,710
And then in Peru they chew coca
leaves and they drink coca tea.

797
00:20:21,711 --> 00:20:24,440
The tea leaves that are
used to make cocaine.

798
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,720
I had that shit that Moscow,

799
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,603
the cocoa.

800
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,590
I did not like it.

801
00:20:27,591 --> 00:20:28,640
I've never done cocaine.

802
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:29,390
I've always been terrified.

803
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,051
Terrified of it.

804
00:20:30,051 --> 00:20:30,440
Yeah.

805
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,180
But um,

806
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,240
I knew that people,

807
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:33,051
when they did coke,

808
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:34,340
that kitten shut the fuck up.

809
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,730
Yeah.

810
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:35,351
So I,

811
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:37,880
I drank this tea and I
couldn't shut the fuck up.

812
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:38,670
Really?

813
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,220
And it was saying that
was with Doug Stan hope.

814
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,011
And I was telling him,

815
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:41,211
I'm like,

816
00:20:41,211 --> 00:20:41,391
dude,

817
00:20:41,391 --> 00:20:42,890
I can't shut the fuck up.

818
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,290
I go and literally I can't

819
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,890
shut the fuck up him on cocaine.

820
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,360
That seems insane.

821
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,260
I would love to have a
video of you on cocaine.

822
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,190
Does not fired up.

823
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:53,741
I don't think.

824
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:54,431
I want to know that.

825
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:55,510
That's even possible.

826
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,920
I don't want to be any,

827
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:58,150
any more intense than I am.

828
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,193
I'm good.

829
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,471
I don't need that shit.

830
00:21:00,471 --> 00:21:01,630
That's a horror movie right there.

831
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,060
Joe Rogan on cocaine this summer.

832
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:05,630
He turns in some hands doing,

833
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,400
you're doing standup.

834
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,230
I'll cocaine.

835
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,501
Oh,

836
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,690
just all angry and
fucking like a punk rock.

837
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,500
And somebody who knows you
and you just throw them out.

838
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,740
You like Ron,

839
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,221
our test.

840
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:18,250
You just jump out in the stands and
start beating somebody accusing Rauner.

841
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,200
Jessica doing cocaine maybe.

842
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:20,800
Wow.

843
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,091
You know what?

844
00:21:21,091 --> 00:21:21,924
Just strong words.

845
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,160
Joe Rogan on cocaine would
look like slept wrong.

846
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,530
Step Tim,

847
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:26,981
get at me.

848
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:27,814
Put me on your show.

849
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,900
Joe Rogan on cocaine would look like
that rise of the planet apes trailer that

850
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:32,651
you haven't seen yet.

851
00:21:32,651 --> 00:21:33,484
I've seen that.

852
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,380
Isn't that fucking insane?

853
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:35,981
A monkey movie.

854
00:21:35,981 --> 00:21:37,210
I thought you meant a documentary.

855
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,810
No.

856
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:38,171
Rise.

857
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:38,861
The planet of the Apes.

858
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:39,160
Look,

859
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,580
look,

860
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,600
those shoots.

861
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:41,291
Amazing.

862
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,430
August 5th bitches.

863
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,230
I'm a little child,

864
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:47,510
bro.

865
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,510
I'll take clearly AP.

866
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,500
You can redo that shit
from me every two years.

867
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:51,334
I'm a dummy.

868
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:55,450
You can have a new script where I know
what's going to happen every couple of

869
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,320
years and you got me.

870
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:56,630
Yeah.

871
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:56,771
Okay.

872
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:57,790
I'm just going to tell you right now,

873
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:01,150
I commit myself to all you people
making planet of the apes movies.

874
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,200
I commit myself.

875
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:04,450
Come out with a new one every
two years and you got me.

876
00:22:04,451 --> 00:22:06,250
I promise you I will buy the Blu Ray.

877
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,420
I will support you.

878
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,430
I will talk about how
good it is on Twitter.

879
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,460
Please keep coming with
the crazy monkey movies.

880
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,190
Crazy monkey.

881
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,070
Oh the shit dude.

882
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,090
This one.

883
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:21,090
So it looks like the researchers like
are you fucking with a eight and they

884
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:22,600
break out and,

885
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:22,811
well,

886
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:25,990
this is sort of what's supposed to
be the prequel to planet of the apes.

887
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,640
This is what caused the problems.

888
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,730
Oh,

889
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,420
this is the idea of planet of the
apes is a guy goes to the future,

890
00:22:31,421 --> 00:22:31,780
right?

891
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,940
And lands in the future and
that essentially run by monkeys.

892
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:35,910
You think about the CGI.

893
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,293
Incredible.

894
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,260
Now it does have that little fake look
and I'm sure it's still got a little bit

895
00:22:41,261 --> 00:22:42,910
of that I am legend Shit going on.

896
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:44,020
When you look in their faces,

897
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,370
they don't quite have it,

898
00:22:45,371 --> 00:22:45,551
man.

899
00:22:45,551 --> 00:22:49,360
It's interesting that they can't
do living things quite right.

900
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,583
Wow.

901
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,630
I wonder if there's going to
be any heartwarming moments.

902
00:22:52,631 --> 00:22:52,711
They,

903
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:54,520
it seems like there's gonna
be some heartwarming moments.

904
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,331
Let me tell you something.

905
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:57,130
If you saw a chimp that look
that you liked this champ,

906
00:22:57,131 --> 00:23:00,340
you would start screaming the fact
that they were all cool with that.

907
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,600
Yeah.

908
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,433
This is weird.

909
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,100
If you saw that chimp,

910
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,900
that ship would be a huge internet hit.

911
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,321
Oh,

912
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:07,360
I didn't know Dexter Morgan was in this.

913
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,003
Wow.

914
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,030
I haven't seen this one.

915
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,120
This is like bad ass preview
Jonathan Lipo and uh,

916
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,491
yeah.

917
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:16,324
Just a moment.

918
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,260
This is the full one.

919
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:17,560
They,

920
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,150
this would shows you where they fucked up.

921
00:23:19,151 --> 00:23:19,901
They raised a chimp.

922
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:22,600
That was their little buddy and
they locked him up in a jail.

923
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,560
Oh my God.

924
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,980
So it's got a good fucking
comeback sets to it.

925
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,600
You root for the chimps.

926
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,880
You realize what conscious human
beings are and you root for the chimps.

927
00:23:31,881 --> 00:23:33,310
Is that the log line for the movie?

928
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:33,570
Yes.

929
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,920
That's the way I'm promoting.

930
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,820
I'm promoting it on sort of a
separate underground labels,

931
00:23:37,821 --> 00:23:38,950
sort of division of the movie.

932
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,970
This is what we do now.

933
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,700
We sort of do shit behind the scenes.

934
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,653
Wow.

935
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:44,960
That's exciting.

936
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,040
Fuck these people.

937
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,401
That's how,

938
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:47,270
that's our promotion.

939
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,080
This is one of those amazing
trailers I've ever seen.

940
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,750
He is intense.

941
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,090
The last thing you ever want
is a chimp coming at you,

942
00:23:56,091 --> 00:23:56,360
man.

943
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,890
That is the last thing you ever want.

944
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,760
You're almost better off with a lion
because the lion is just going to kill you

945
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:02,594
quick.

946
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,760
Chimps are going to do some shit to
you before you die by your fingers or

947
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,100
they're going to,

948
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,120
they're not trying to kill you.

949
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:09,020
They're trying to hurt you.

950
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,130
They understand what makes you a
person and they don't have morals.

951
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,870
They understand what's important to you.

952
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:17,090
They understand your
genitals mean a lot to you.

953
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:18,410
So the bike those off.

954
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:18,780
Yeah.

955
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,950
They understand that your
fingers are important for you to,

956
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,100
to use to make things.

957
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,870
So they bite all those off next.

958
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,081
Yeah.

959
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:27,110
And they do all this without you being
able to do a goddamn thing to stop it.

960
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:27,830
Nothing.

961
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,950
Because they're so fucking strong
and once they bite one finger off,

962
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:31,131
dude,

963
00:24:31,131 --> 00:24:31,941
you're going to be freaking out.

964
00:24:31,941 --> 00:24:32,721
You're going to be in shock.

965
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,190
You're not gonna be able
to handle it for him.

966
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:35,150
It's another day in the park.

967
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,070
He's been biting fingers
off since he was two.

968
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,400
Yeah.

969
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,870
You know someone's step soon wrong.

970
00:24:38,871 --> 00:24:40,070
Who Bites a couple of fingers off.

971
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:42,350
That's just what they
do and strong as fuck.

972
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,020
Can't even wrap your head around
how strong a champion's dude.

973
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,320
We had a two year old chip
on a set of news radio,

974
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,610
a two year old little baby ass chimp.

975
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:54,530
This thing was on my back and it's swatted
me in the back a couple of times and

976
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:55,311
I swear to God,

977
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:56,210
I got nervous.

978
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:58,400
It made me nervous cause
I was thinking like,

979
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,560
what if a cat wanted to kill me?

980
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:00,981
You know,

981
00:25:00,981 --> 00:25:02,030
if a cat wanted to kill me,

982
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:02,810
that's terrifying.

983
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,350
Right?

984
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,340
Cats or you know,

985
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,370
I mean even though they're little like
that fucking crazy thing coming at you

986
00:25:07,371 --> 00:25:08,204
trying to kill it.

987
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:08,390
Yeah,

988
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,470
that would be terrifying.

989
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:09,771
You know,

990
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:10,251
and you're way,

991
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:11,210
way bigger than a cat.

992
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:11,931
And I was thinking,

993
00:25:11,931 --> 00:25:14,450
how much bigger is this chimp than a cat?

994
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,460
And at this champ decided
to just fuck me up.

995
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,310
I'm not really sure I could defend myself.

996
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,080
He's a two year old chimp and I'm not.

997
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:22,880
I'm not really sure that I would get off.

998
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,590
And then I thought about it and I think,

999
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:25,424
my God,

1000
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,640
what must it be like when
they're like 150 pounds?

1001
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,590
It must be unbelievable.

1002
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,980
The amount of force they can generate
with their bodies must get you some

1003
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:34,940
shocking.

1004
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,220
They can rip car doors off their hinges.

1005
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:37,640
Yeah,

1006
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,680
do you can lock a car door
and they can just open it.

1007
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:40,514
They can open that.

1008
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,150
Yeah.

1009
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,260
Fuck that.

1010
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,460
Fuck that right today.

1011
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,091
That lady,

1012
00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:45,920
they tour with their hands.

1013
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:49,160
They tore her jaw out of her
face and lower jaw came out,

1014
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:49,430
you know.

1015
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,480
Oh my God.

1016
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,310
God Damn.

1017
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:52,971
That's,

1018
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:53,300
yeah,

1019
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,380
there's scary,

1020
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,880
scary fucking creatures.

1021
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,810
It's so funny that we always want to
like look at them like they're real cute

1022
00:25:59,811 --> 00:25:59,991
too.

1023
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:04,050
Like Bj Mckee and this is
my best friend bear band.

1024
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,860
It was the best smoking
the band and have a monkey.

1025
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:07,550
Wait,

1026
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,480
what was the one of the monkey?

1027
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:08,841
No,

1028
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:09,674
Curtis would,

1029
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,620
Clint Eastwood had a
Orangutang every which way,

1030
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:13,250
but loose.

1031
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,083
That's the one that's,

1032
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,470
the partner has no idea
what he's talking about.

1033
00:26:16,471 --> 00:26:17,171
Being in the band.

1034
00:26:17,171 --> 00:26:19,010
Some of the best moments in my childhood,

1035
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,270
it was that guy with the
monkey who which one?

1036
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:22,851
Oh yeah.

1037
00:26:22,851 --> 00:26:23,540
Burt Reynolds.

1038
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:23,880
I was like,

1039
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,713
fine,

1040
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,390
but they all came out at the same time.

1041
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,630
There was like that car chase movie
then there was kind of monkeys.

1042
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,300
No I don't.

1043
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,480
I think every movie in that
time period had a monkey.

1044
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:37,430
It seemed like a strong move by Clint
Eastwood to go from Spaghetti Westerns to

1045
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:38,300
the bad ass,

1046
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,530
bare knuckle fist fighter
with a monkey has event.

1047
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,140
Well the orangutan,

1048
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,480
those movies were great man
every which way but loose.

1049
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:47,310
They were great fucking movies for sure.

1050
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,730
And what's even more fascinating about
those movies is that's when he was still

1051
00:26:50,731 --> 00:26:51,690
married to that woman,

1052
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:52,780
Sandra Locke,

1053
00:26:52,781 --> 00:26:56,250
the woman who had gone to sue him and
he had to get her some sort of a deal to

1054
00:26:56,251 --> 00:26:57,000
get out of switch.

1055
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,833
Yeah.

1056
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,440
Had to get her some sort of a deal with
a production company as a part of their

1057
00:27:01,441 --> 00:27:01,981
divorce.

1058
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:02,731
And he did.

1059
00:27:02,731 --> 00:27:03,270
And then,

1060
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:03,510
you know,

1061
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,860
she accused him of sabotaging her
projects and their projects bringing,

1062
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:07,080
going.

1063
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,201
Like,

1064
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:11,670
it was obvious that this guy fucked up
like poor Clint Eastwood married this

1065
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,504
crazy broad,

1066
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,081
you know,

1067
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:14,580
and was with her for years and you know,

1068
00:27:14,581 --> 00:27:16,320
she's an actress and when they broke up,

1069
00:27:16,321 --> 00:27:16,591
man,

1070
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:18,580
she just fucking went after him and,

1071
00:27:18,581 --> 00:27:19,160
and you,

1072
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,591
you know,

1073
00:27:19,591 --> 00:27:24,591
you got to see the nastiness that that
can happen and those sort of like really

1074
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:28,950
public divorces between two
fucking movie stars at the time.

1075
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:29,101
I mean,

1076
00:27:29,101 --> 00:27:30,690
she never really worked again after that.

1077
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,823
Not much.

1078
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,011
I mean,

1079
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:34,200
I've done not have that level,

1080
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:35,400
but she wasn't a lot of clinics.

1081
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:39,120
So it's movies and the amount of money
that exchanges hands and a divorce like

1082
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:39,390
that.

1083
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,440
Oh Man.

1084
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,940
Oh No.

1085
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:45,030
So you got to see like him
with her back in the day.

1086
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:46,290
That's when he was still with her,

1087
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:46,981
you know,

1088
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:47,431
and it was like,

1089
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:47,761
wow,

1090
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:48,511
how weird is this?

1091
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:49,560
This dude like Carrie,

1092
00:27:49,561 --> 00:27:51,300
this tick around and a bunch of movies.

1093
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,373
Yeah.

1094
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,990
How many movies did cleanings
would do it shot Sondra Locke.

1095
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,070
How many?

1096
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,560
It was the,

1097
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,630
it was a western,

1098
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,151
right.

1099
00:27:58,151 --> 00:27:59,340
It wasn't her one western.

1100
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,530
And then there was every
which way but loose.

1101
00:28:01,531 --> 00:28:01,890
Right.

1102
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,521
Or one of those.

1103
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:03,360
Any which way you can.

1104
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:04,194
Which one was it?

1105
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,700
Was it both of them was at all of them?

1106
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:06,750
All of them.

1107
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,583
I Dunno.

1108
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,490
It's fast.

1109
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,170
It is fast.

1110
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,380
You forget to like,

1111
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:10,771
you know,

1112
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:11,371
we always like,

1113
00:28:11,371 --> 00:28:14,480
they always talk about who makes like
crazy money and movies and so if they're

1114
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,210
like,

1115
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:15,571
you know,

1116
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:19,020
so and so like got $100 million
divorce and they're like,

1117
00:28:19,021 --> 00:28:19,381
who is it?

1118
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:20,071
And like Tom Cruise,

1119
00:28:20,071 --> 00:28:20,281
you're like,

1120
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:20,460
yeah,

1121
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:25,080
well that dude's like super
like he's a moneymaking machine.

1122
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,540
But then like Morgan
Freeman who you're like,

1123
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:27,721
yeah,

1124
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:28,231
Morgan Freeman,

1125
00:28:28,231 --> 00:28:29,520
he's great and he's a great actor.

1126
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,533
He's been a lot of movies.

1127
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,620
He got divorced,

1128
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,730
I think he gave,

1129
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,160
I want to say like over 70 million.

1130
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:35,460
Oh.

1131
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,001
So we were like,

1132
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:37,260
Holy Shit,

1133
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:41,550
how much fucking money does Morgan Freeman
and you know Morgan's Freeman's deal

1134
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:42,570
right now.

1135
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:47,630
Morgan Freeman is apparently
banging his non for what?

1136
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,550
It's his grandmother,

1137
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:55,580
granddaughter from his Ex Wife's
side who is not related to by blood.

1138
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,390
Huh?

1139
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:57,631
Yeah.

1140
00:28:57,631 --> 00:28:57,841
Yeah.

1141
00:28:57,841 --> 00:28:58,674
Some for him.

1142
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,540
Something super creepy like that.

1143
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:00,900
That's crazy.

1144
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,880
And he started taking her to events and
introducing her as his granddaughter.

1145
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,900
Oh yeah.

1146
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:11,610
And then somewhere along the line
it came out that he was banging her.

1147
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,570
Whoa.

1148
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:13,290
Yeah.

1149
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,190
And everybody's like,

1150
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:15,570
what the fuck?

1151
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,190
You're so good and accurate.

1152
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:18,024
Morgan Freeman,

1153
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:18,863
I don't care.

1154
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:23,370
I know that's how maybe with stone
and he thinks it's really funny.

1155
00:29:23,371 --> 00:29:24,570
Stills don't right now.

1156
00:29:24,571 --> 00:29:25,650
You mean listen,

1157
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:26,251
he,

1158
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:26,611
you know what?

1159
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:27,570
Here's what the deal is.

1160
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,081
He's like,

1161
00:29:28,081 --> 00:29:28,291
what,

1162
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:29,070
70 years old?

1163
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,400
Yeah,

1164
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,020
I think so.

1165
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,030
At least 25 year old pussy is so powerful.

1166
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,060
It will get you to abandon your morals,

1167
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:36,570
your idea.

1168
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,300
You like the bull yet you will
rationalize the shit out of his.

1169
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:39,511
Yeah,

1170
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:40,830
I've known her since she was a baby,

1171
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,760
but we're not like related by blood.

1172
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:43,270
Yeah.

1173
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:43,841
That's crazy.

1174
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:44,840
But they never get met.

1175
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,670
Plus he does so good.

1176
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,470
Cause he's an old,

1177
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,370
old man.

1178
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,150
You know,

1179
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,450
she's young and tight and she's trying
to rock him because she likes the

1180
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:53,080
spotlight.

1181
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,100
She likes the fact that she's,

1182
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:54,610
you know,

1183
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:58,300
throwing some pussy at Morgan Freeman or
is it the best payback ever to your ex

1184
00:29:58,301 --> 00:30:00,220
wife or he's the one who goes after it.

1185
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:01,230
He couldn't be a creep to,

1186
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:02,500
you've got to look at it that way.

1187
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:02,800
Sure.

1188
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,010
It could have been Hawkin her,

1189
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,450
you know,

1190
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,620
his whole life and waiting for her to
turn 18 and start putting it to her.

1191
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,320
How about the dude who just married
the 16 year old haven't lost.

1192
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,000
You have the guy from La Woo,

1193
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,650
she's 16 where her fucking parents,

1194
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:18,030
man,

1195
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:18,880
they were cool with it.

1196
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,080
That's the crazy part.

1197
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,250
Your parents have to,

1198
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:23,650
if you're 16 in Vegas and
you want to get married,

1199
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,790
you have to get like permission.

1200
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,673
Yeah.

1201
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:29,920
And I think it was probably set up for
teen pregnancies and shit like that.

1202
00:30:29,921 --> 00:30:31,090
Somebody's trying to do the right thing.

1203
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:31,810
Yeah.

1204
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:32,890
Fucking a man.

1205
00:30:32,891 --> 00:30:33,671
Her parents were just like,

1206
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:33,911
we look,

1207
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:34,680
we love lost.

1208
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,513
Why

1209
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,690
is a great show?

1210
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,350
We'll get guys like that.

1211
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,340
Is he done?

1212
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,021
The guy's done.

1213
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:41,440
Right?

1214
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,801
Yeah.

1215
00:30:41,801 --> 00:30:44,200
You can't go around Mary and 16 year olds.

1216
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:45,640
People kind of want to hang out with you,

1217
00:30:45,641 --> 00:30:46,320
man.

1218
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:46,570
This,

1219
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:49,090
this ain't the 1950s and
you're not Jerry Lee Lewis.

1220
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:49,850
No.

1221
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,590
You know what I mean?

1222
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,850
You can't marry that girl.

1223
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,140
That's crazy.

1224
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,180
That's got to keep him from jobs too.

1225
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,260
Like there's a few directors or producers
out there who would consider that dude

1226
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:02,260
for a job and then hear
that and go in that man.

1227
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:02,611
What,

1228
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:02,701
um,

1229
00:31:02,701 --> 00:31:03,670
what's the other guy's name?

1230
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,570
Let's get you on the phone.

1231
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,141
Yeah.

1232
00:31:05,141 --> 00:31:05,531
Listen,

1233
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:06,730
he's not that good.

1234
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:07,660
Right.

1235
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,980
I'm going to say that that's not worth
the show unless it was some sort of a

1236
00:31:11,981 --> 00:31:15,640
reality show based on the two
of them that that could work.

1237
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,270
Yeah.

1238
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,760
That could work or reality
show based on a 16 year old,

1239
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,490
but it really be unfair to the
16 year old because you know,

1240
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,660
when you were 16 years old,

1241
00:31:22,661 --> 00:31:27,460
would you really want some document out
there of who you were and how you behave

1242
00:31:27,461 --> 00:31:30,490
when you were 16 and the whole world
can look at it whenever they want,

1243
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,090
especially when you fucked up and
you married some 51 year old dude,

1244
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:34,691
you know,

1245
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:34,991
well,

1246
00:31:34,991 --> 00:31:36,940
why should everybody be
able to look into your shit?

1247
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:39,580
You're not really old enough to
understand what the fuck that means.

1248
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,240
Yet you're not really old enough to
understand the ramifications of the whole

1249
00:31:43,241 --> 00:31:43,721
world.

1250
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:45,220
Being able to look in on that,

1251
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:45,880
you know,

1252
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,710
so that you couldn't have
a reality show with her.

1253
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,580
I think about how little I think about
how little you knew when you were 16 oh

1254
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,630
my God,

1255
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,120
I was such a fucking Douche bag.

1256
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:55,511
Yeah,

1257
00:31:55,511 --> 00:31:55,930
man.

1258
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:56,250
I was like,

1259
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,670
imagine if you had to meet yourself
today and hang out with yourself.

1260
00:31:58,730 --> 00:31:59,590
It's a 16 year old.

1261
00:31:59,591 --> 00:32:00,424
I'd be like,

1262
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,121
seriously?

1263
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:02,680
Just to shut the fuck up.

1264
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,880
Just shut the fuck up.

1265
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:04,714
Dude.

1266
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:05,171
I tell you,

1267
00:32:05,171 --> 00:32:05,980
I found it.

1268
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,531
I found it.

1269
00:32:06,531 --> 00:32:07,540
I'll just give myself a hug.

1270
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,600
I found a video of my son would
probably need a slow kiss.

1271
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,280
I found a video of myself.

1272
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,350
I took a camera,

1273
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:13,480
uh,

1274
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,480
camcorder to a party when I was 18.

1275
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,530
Oh my God.

1276
00:32:17,531 --> 00:32:17,950
Right.

1277
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:18,371
And a,

1278
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:19,204
it was like,

1279
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,290
I'm a senior in high school and I walked
through and I just talked to people and

1280
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:27,280
I put the camera on myself and I'm just
doing this for like 30 minutes at this

1281
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:28,060
party.

1282
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,140
I watched the video,

1283
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,100
I took it out and then I broke
the tape and I burned it.

1284
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:33,580
Really?

1285
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,120
Whoa.

1286
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,421
Yeah.

1287
00:32:34,421 --> 00:32:35,880
And it wasn't anything incriminating.

1288
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:36,251
It was just,

1289
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:37,210
I was so,

1290
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,490
it was like a really rapid,

1291
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:45,340
like instinctive response to how
much I loathed myself as an 18.

1292
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:45,801
I was like,

1293
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:47,000
that's fucking embarrassing.

1294
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,410
I don't want anybody to see that.

1295
00:32:48,411 --> 00:32:51,620
And I told her I was like
not nostalgic or like,

1296
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:52,730
that'd be cool to show it to my kid.

1297
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:53,031
I'd be like,

1298
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:54,290
I hope my kids never could find that.

1299
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:55,970
Wow.

1300
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,110
Because I was fucking like,

1301
00:32:57,111 --> 00:32:57,381
Hey,

1302
00:32:57,381 --> 00:32:58,071
what's up buddy?

1303
00:32:58,071 --> 00:32:59,070
What's over like

1304
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:02,631
myself?

1305
00:33:02,631 --> 00:33:05,150
And it was fucking horrifying.

1306
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,780
You think about like the shit
you did when you were like,

1307
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,381
we're like,

1308
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:09,920
wait,

1309
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,131
shit.

1310
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:11,570
You yelled out to people and like,

1311
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:11,901
I was like,

1312
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:13,290
that's fucking embarrassing my,

1313
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:13,581
you know,

1314
00:33:13,581 --> 00:33:14,420
the thing is though,

1315
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,410
you're going to think it's,

1316
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,480
you think it's embarrassing now,

1317
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,260
but you're going to wish
once you have kids have,

1318
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,590
I know I fucked up.

1319
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,710
I know all my shit online
and I've had it on,

1320
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:24,951
you know,

1321
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:28,910
from when I was 15 I have a movie
called carrots that I did to like,

1322
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,270
you know,

1323
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:33,050
18 I had this movie where me and my
friends just smoked weed and got drunk and

1324
00:33:33,051 --> 00:33:36,530
we're hanging out in this one bedroom
apartment like I have all this gets stuck

1325
00:33:36,531 --> 00:33:36,890
and I just,

1326
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:37,330
you know what,

1327
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,180
I'm just putting it out there.

1328
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:38,991
I know it's embarrassing.

1329
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:40,670
It makes me look like shit or bad,

1330
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,030
but that's only myself telling me that,

1331
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,361
you know,

1332
00:33:44,361 --> 00:33:44,960
it's like,

1333
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,430
it doesn't,

1334
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,310
people once,

1335
00:33:46,311 --> 00:33:49,670
once you have children of your own and
you start thinking about the process of

1336
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,670
going from being a baby to actually being
a human and all the shit you have to

1337
00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:53,504
learn along the way,

1338
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,830
then it's going to be fascinating to,

1339
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:55,010
you.

1340
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:58,040
Sure ain't gonna wish
you had it because yeah.

1341
00:33:58,041 --> 00:33:59,660
Before I had babies,

1342
00:33:59,661 --> 00:34:01,370
I probably would've
looked at it differently.

1343
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:03,200
Like I don't want any
evidence that I was a retard.

1344
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:03,591
You know,

1345
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:07,670
like there's some video of me from
Rascal's comedy hour in New Jersey.

1346
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,200
I was like 24,

1347
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,520
25 of June,

1348
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,031
beautiful,

1349
00:34:11,031 --> 00:34:15,230
delicious head of hair and
I'm fucking real skinny.

1350
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:17,090
I didn't even lift the
weights back then and uh,

1351
00:34:17,091 --> 00:34:18,170
I'm doing standup.

1352
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:18,590
I was like,

1353
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,700
Oh God.

1354
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,630
So dorky.

1355
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,110
Yeah,

1356
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,520
my shirts Dorky.

1357
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:23,750
I look Dorky,

1358
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,650
like sound.

1359
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,180
I sound Hacky,

1360
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:27,500
like eh,

1361
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,850
but it's cool.

1362
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,331
I liked it.

1363
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:30,110
It's out there.

1364
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,790
I bet if I saw that video right now,

1365
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:32,780
I would be laughing.

1366
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:35,660
My fucking cute cute.

1367
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,680
I can show you.

1368
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,620
I can show you old standup.

1369
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,060
I mean old like seven,

1370
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:42,250
eight years old where you don't,

1371
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,420
you don't recognize the
way I look or really,

1372
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:49,000
really long hair like flowing locks,

1373
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:52,250
like just like really thin and happy.

1374
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,070
It's weird how people's
voices change over the years.

1375
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:55,791
You know?

1376
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:58,130
I hear my voice when I was
younger and things and I'm like,

1377
00:34:58,131 --> 00:34:58,371
wow,

1378
00:34:58,371 --> 00:35:00,020
my voice was so high pitched.

1379
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:00,960
Yeah.

1380
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,150
It's still like a boy,

1381
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:02,781
you know?

1382
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:03,411
It's weird.

1383
00:35:03,411 --> 00:35:03,830
You know?

1384
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,560
I'm really selling what
I'm saying to them.

1385
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,060
Like,

1386
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,650
you know,

1387
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:07,940
like I'm really like,

1388
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:08,540
you know,

1389
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,740
over a high tone to your voice that
happens like after you become 30 where you

1390
00:35:12,741 --> 00:35:13,670
become like a man.

1391
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,390
You know,

1392
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:14,630
there's,

1393
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,910
when you're younger you
don't even realize it,

1394
00:35:16,911 --> 00:35:18,740
but you have this weird
high pitch to your,

1395
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,100
to your voice.

1396
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:20,480
Yeah.

1397
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,080
Yeah.

1398
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,990
I always thought it was
cigarettes that for you.

1399
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,161
For you.

1400
00:35:25,161 --> 00:35:25,400
Yeah.

1401
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,840
You never really became a man.

1402
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,630
It's just cigarettes.

1403
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,090
Make it sound like one when I'm,

1404
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:29,924
when I'm,

1405
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,070
when you went at 50 it's
going to be full circle.

1406
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,980
You're going to be on something to
treat Duke cancer that you have from

1407
00:35:37,981 --> 00:35:41,130
cigarette smoke and it's gonna make
you develop even more estrogen.

1408
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,390
That's what's going to fight the cancer.

1409
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,600
And then you're going to sound like
large Marge from peewee's big adventure.

1410
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,910
Tell him large large sent Ya.

1411
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:48,091
Yeah.

1412
00:35:48,091 --> 00:35:48,924
That's going to be you.

1413
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,250
You're going to sound like an old lady.

1414
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,980
Did you guys see the pee
wee Herman a live show?

1415
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,661
They have it on.

1416
00:35:53,661 --> 00:35:54,810
I know we or something.

1417
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:54,930
No,

1418
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,250
they haven't on HBO or showtime.

1419
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,050
They filmed his live show.

1420
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,651
Live show.

1421
00:35:58,651 --> 00:35:59,190
What does he do?

1422
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,023
He brought back.

1423
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,230
Oh,

1424
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,063
get the fuck out of here.

1425
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:02,430
Yeah,

1426
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,900
it's sold out everywhere.

1427
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:04,531
Of course it did.

1428
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:04,860
Yeah.

1429
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,660
It is so weird to watch
this and adult though.

1430
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:07,400
I uh,

1431
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,850
my class is 80 and doing it.

1432
00:36:08,851 --> 00:36:09,810
That's the creepy thing.

1433
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,430
He did it at that Nokia Club.

1434
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,600
Like the theater,

1435
00:36:12,601 --> 00:36:14,430
but like the smaller of the two downtown.

1436
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:14,790
Yeah.

1437
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,710
And my cousin went and
he said that it was just,

1438
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:18,090
it's all people like,

1439
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,380
uh,

1440
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,213
you know,

1441
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,410
like they would say
lines at the same time.

1442
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:24,210
Like it was like seeing
like a band or something,

1443
00:36:24,211 --> 00:36:25,044
you know?

1444
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,200
They would all look at each
chosen an astrologer thing.

1445
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,040
Oh absolutely.

1446
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,460
Yeah.

1447
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,370
Everybody in that theater is like,

1448
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:32,720
did you,

1449
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,350
did you grow up with weird Al Yankovic?

1450
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:34,860
Yeah,

1451
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,340
sure.

1452
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,720
I just got his new album.

1453
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,460
That is the funniest shit ever.

1454
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:39,990
That guy is still has it man.

1455
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:44,250
Really ridiculous to listen to when
you're just really big to driving on the

1456
00:36:44,251 --> 00:36:44,820
highway.

1457
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,220
You'll sit there and giggle
the whole fucking way home.

1458
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,990
We got to get him on your podcast.

1459
00:36:48,991 --> 00:36:49,771
That would be awesome.

1460
00:36:49,771 --> 00:36:52,980
I was always a fan of weird
Al Yankovic when I was a kid.

1461
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:54,780
I thought he was hilarious.

1462
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,280
I'm fat.

1463
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,550
I would always wait for his new shit to
come out when he came out with I'm fat.

1464
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:00,763
You know Roy big,

1465
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,471
big country.

1466
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:03,630
Nelson still goes into the
octagon with that song.

1467
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,260
No,

1468
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,460
he enters with that song.

1469
00:37:05,461 --> 00:37:08,250
He's the only fighter that
enters on a weird Al Yankovic.

1470
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,031
That's pretty.

1471
00:37:09,031 --> 00:37:09,870
That's pretty awesome.

1472
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,700
Fuck you like that guy a lot.

1473
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,780
How can he not like that guy?

1474
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,790
I remember good guys got
the best personality.

1475
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,540
He's,

1476
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,710
he's so talented too,

1477
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,370
you know,

1478
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,600
and he's just trying to lose some weight.

1479
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,750
He's trying to like earliest
get in better shape and yeah,

1480
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:21,541
he's just,

1481
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:22,050
you know,

1482
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,220
super talented.

1483
00:37:23,221 --> 00:37:23,611
It's just,

1484
00:37:23,611 --> 00:37:25,260
he's not in the best physical condition.

1485
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,071
God Damn.

1486
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:27,630
He's got a great personality though.

1487
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,493
I have,

1488
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:33,530
I have a video of myself at like eight
years old with my cousin who is eight and

1489
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:36,330
my other cousins nine
and we've seen I'm fat

1490
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:41,370
and have that a talent
show and we're all skinny.

1491
00:37:41,371 --> 00:37:44,550
But I hog the mic and I'm
the one that ended up fat,

1492
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,580
like of the three of us
put that online dude.

1493
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,670
Like I would get really into it.

1494
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:52,441
Yeah,

1495
00:37:52,441 --> 00:37:54,270
you should definitely put
some of that stuff somewhere.

1496
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:54,631
Yeah,

1497
00:37:54,631 --> 00:37:54,841
no,

1498
00:37:54,841 --> 00:37:55,850
I thought I wouldn't get rid of it,

1499
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,151
but I'm going.

1500
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:56,280
No,

1501
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:56,610
you should.

1502
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,200
You should put that on the next DVD.

1503
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:58,981
But yeah,

1504
00:37:58,981 --> 00:37:59,910
we do a DVD.

1505
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:01,350
Have that as be as one of the extras.

1506
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:01,550
Yeah,

1507
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,060
I should.

1508
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,401
Yeah,

1509
00:38:02,401 --> 00:38:02,791
why not?

1510
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:03,360
That's hilarious.

1511
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,230
And I also have college college
sketches that we made were like,

1512
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:08,520
we had like a,

1513
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,510
we did a commercial,

1514
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,730
a fake commercial for a product called
anal freeze and it was like for like when

1515
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:16,170
like when you have diarrhea.

1516
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:16,681
I just was like,

1517
00:38:16,681 --> 00:38:17,251
I have diarrhea.

1518
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:17,461
I'm like,

1519
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,510
well why don't you use Angel Freezer?

1520
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,190
It will freeze all that crap up.

1521
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,150
Like that's the tag.

1522
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:26,510
It'll freeze all that crap up and then
like it's horrible and be like it comes

1523
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:29,070
in a bottle and you just shove
the whole bottle up your ass.

1524
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,550
We have videos of that type
of genius had highbrow stuff.

1525
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,170
Oh that's hilarious.

1526
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,300
That and like a Kung,

1527
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,640
a fake Kung Fu

1528
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,620
short where like we like layer Wu
Tang music and we have like a Kung Fu.

1529
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,370
That's why no one can ever
be cocky about where you are.

1530
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,990
Don't be disrespectful about
other people's material.

1531
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,280
Yeah,

1532
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:48,611
yeah.

1533
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:49,690
They might suck right now,

1534
00:38:49,691 --> 00:38:53,080
but guess at one point in
time you suck too a lot.

1535
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,950
You sucks a lot.

1536
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:54,460
A lot.

1537
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,151
Everybody does.

1538
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:55,930
Yeah.

1539
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:56,441
You can't,

1540
00:38:56,441 --> 00:38:58,690
not second you start on anything.

1541
00:38:58,691 --> 00:38:59,440
You want to suck.

1542
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,220
The best part though is at
that time you don't know.

1543
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,123
You think you're good.

1544
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,100
There was a bunch of times where I was
like open mic nights and I couldn't get

1545
00:39:06,101 --> 00:39:06,191
on.

1546
00:39:06,191 --> 00:39:07,210
I was like man I'm going to get up there.

1547
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,490
I'll fucking show these people what's up.

1548
00:39:08,491 --> 00:39:09,550
And meanwhile I was terrible.

1549
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:13,510
I shouldn't not have had any confidence
whatsoever know that I can go up there

1550
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,590
and make people laugh.

1551
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,453
I was awful.

1552
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,840
I shouldn't have been
allowed to talk ever.

1553
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:21,010
I should have been practicing with only
people barely spoke English for the

1554
00:39:21,011 --> 00:39:24,560
years to work my way is the main stream.

1555
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,290
But that's just how it is.

1556
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:26,860
Right?

1557
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,431
Absolutely.

1558
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,050
I remember like you
remember like when you have,

1559
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:34,290
when you finally have like 10 or 15
minutes down that kills and then something

1560
00:39:34,991 --> 00:39:37,840
happens one night where like you just
don't know how to react to a room.

1561
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,880
Oh so it doesn't kill it actually bombs.

1562
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,380
This is the shit.

1563
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:43,540
Like this is the best
material at all time.

1564
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:47,500
Best thing I got my toolbox and
you have nothing else to go to.

1565
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:52,630
That is like a paralyzing feeling and
then you realize cause you'd killed with

1566
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:56,860
it so many times you get a feeling of
being kind of invincible and then when it

1567
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,870
doesn't kill your like maybe Oh shit.

1568
00:39:58,871 --> 00:40:00,640
Like maybe this isn't amazed.

1569
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,250
Like that's where you
wish you had a real job.

1570
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,881
It's like God,

1571
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:07,690
if I just had a job I'd be like reporting
back to the stockholder as well.

1572
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:12,130
We have a discrepancy between the
projected income and the actual income.

1573
00:40:12,131 --> 00:40:13,810
We're going to give you some
figures on this on Monday,

1574
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,340
but it's nothing we can't fix.

1575
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,390
Yeah.

1576
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,080
But when you're out there and saw all you,

1577
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:20,320
your Thompson who are incorporated
and you're eating a dick,

1578
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,550
eating huge,

1579
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,793
you know,

1580
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,760
what would you like me to do?

1581
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:26,740
Boss can't.

1582
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,800
They can't say that because what
you're doing is you're the boss,

1583
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,230
you're the boss,

1584
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:30,761
you're the Ed.

1585
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,410
The end of the line is you stupid.

1586
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:36,430
And if you're doing it and you don't
know how to dance like now if like

1587
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:37,690
something like if it were to be like,

1588
00:40:37,691 --> 00:40:38,111
man this,

1589
00:40:38,111 --> 00:40:38,920
that was really,

1590
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,780
that was what that job
bombed or something happened.

1591
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:44,230
You have the tools after
a while to adjust to that.

1592
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:49,060
The problem then is that like you just
don't even know how to it like and you

1593
00:40:49,061 --> 00:40:51,010
panic and they found they panic for you.

1594
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:51,461
Yes.

1595
00:40:51,461 --> 00:40:53,140
They see the panic and then they're like,

1596
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:53,411
oh,

1597
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:54,244
we're all panicking.

1598
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:56,680
Like then you're in a
fucking elevator fire.

1599
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,640
Like people are just like,

1600
00:40:57,641 --> 00:40:59,140
how the fuck do we get out of here?

1601
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,060
I was a recently,

1602
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:05,980
I saw a friend of mine and he fucked up
a joke and then after you fucked up a

1603
00:41:05,981 --> 00:41:06,281
joke,

1604
00:41:06,281 --> 00:41:10,660
he started rushing the next joke because
you could feel that he fucked up and

1605
00:41:10,661 --> 00:41:13,930
that joke bombed and then
I felt like the spin,

1606
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,651
I felt the spin,

1607
00:41:14,651 --> 00:41:15,484
the slide and my,

1608
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,830
my toes started crunching up on my shoes.

1609
00:41:17,831 --> 00:41:18,910
I clenched my hands together.

1610
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,230
He pulled himself out of it,

1611
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,520
but I almost had to leave the room.

1612
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:21,970
Really?

1613
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:22,360
Yeah.

1614
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,193
Yeah.

1615
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,400
He got a couple of good laughs and
then the ball started rolling again.

1616
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:26,770
That was like,

1617
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:27,071
okay,

1618
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:27,904
we're back.

1619
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:31,630
But it's the uncomfortable thing of
watching someone's slide down the road to

1620
00:41:31,631 --> 00:41:32,310
bombed them.

1621
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,143
Yeah.

1622
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,070
I don't want to be there for

1623
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,470
that.

1624
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:34,700
It's,

1625
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:34,950
it's,

1626
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,900
it's really painful.

1627
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,070
I don't need to see that dude.

1628
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,371
I know.

1629
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:37,821
It sucks.

1630
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:38,750
That's why I ride a lot.

1631
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:39,500
Yeah.

1632
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,120
And you can almost do you
doing over there and Brian,

1633
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,100
you and Justin sounds
thinking little thing.

1634
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:43,430
Yeah.

1635
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,660
Why don't you tell us
when you're doing that,

1636
00:41:44,661 --> 00:41:46,280
otherwise it freaks me the fuck out.

1637
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,241
Oh Man.

1638
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:47,511
Of course.

1639
00:41:47,511 --> 00:41:49,040
Are My ears getting way better,

1640
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:49,341
Joe,

1641
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:49,850
you got to watch,

1642
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:52,280
look at the Salvia video that
Tom was talking about earlier.

1643
00:41:52,281 --> 00:41:55,410
This is going to be the
one that when Tom got here,

1644
00:41:55,411 --> 00:41:56,480
the on the first things you said is,

1645
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:56,691
dude,

1646
00:41:56,691 --> 00:41:57,640
you got to see this video,

1647
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,970
this couple smoking Salvia.

1648
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,360
And why is it so interesting that it
has a million fucking hits on Youtube?

1649
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,330
Cause what happens in it?

1650
00:42:04,331 --> 00:42:04,820
Yeah.

1651
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,260
Even though Ari Shaffir when he did
Salvia and I heard you freaked out.

1652
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:09,711
Oh yeah,

1653
00:42:09,711 --> 00:42:10,550
you gotta check out that video.

1654
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,600
I saw a little bits of it,

1655
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:12,350
but yeah,

1656
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:12,680
yeah.

1657
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,200
From his account in times
that times that by a billion,

1658
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:17,810
and this is 126,000 people
are seeing this right here.

1659
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:18,681
Just this one.

1660
00:42:18,681 --> 00:42:20,210
It's uploaded like a
million times on here.

1661
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,140
Yeah.

1662
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:21,721
So they're,

1663
00:42:21,721 --> 00:42:23,660
they're recording themselves doing Salvey,

1664
00:42:23,661 --> 00:42:24,680
which a lot of people do.

1665
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:25,251
Yeah.

1666
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,510
What is the big deal about that?

1667
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,590
How'd that all get going?

1668
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,421
Because you,

1669
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:31,610
you leave your body like
it's only a couple minutes,

1670
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,171
so you,

1671
00:42:32,171 --> 00:42:33,890
you're really interested
to see what happens,

1672
00:42:33,891 --> 00:42:34,131
you know,

1673
00:42:34,131 --> 00:42:34,970
cause you're out of it,

1674
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:38,450
but you're awake type thing when everybody
does it the same way you guys did it

1675
00:42:38,451 --> 00:42:43,040
with Ari and what I would imagine it's
like the worst environment possible.

1676
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:43,430
Yeah.

1677
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,780
When you're filming these fucking things.

1678
00:42:44,781 --> 00:42:45,230
Yeah.

1679
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:50,110
So the worst environment possible
this do takes some rips off this bone.

1680
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:50,680
Yeah.

1681
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:50,930
Yeah.

1682
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:51,650
Like he,

1683
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:56,480
I mean I can't say what that does for
people don't know what the Fuck Salvia is.

1684
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,070
Feet squares out there.

1685
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:01,220
Salvia is a super
powerful psychedelic drug,

1686
00:43:01,221 --> 00:43:04,010
but is a very legal for some weird reason.

1687
00:43:04,011 --> 00:43:04,520
Yeah.

1688
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:09,520
It was one that was missed in the whole
sweeping psychedelic drug acts of the

1689
00:43:09,831 --> 00:43:11,330
1970s whatever it was,

1690
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:14,330
1970 when they made everything illegal,

1691
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:15,141
somehow or another,

1692
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:16,010
they miss Salvia.

1693
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:19,710
So these people are taking something
and other laugh and their balls off.

1694
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,613
Yeah,

1695
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:24,890
it's a hundred times more powerful than
marijuana and you can buy it in head

1696
00:43:24,891 --> 00:43:25,820
shops legally.

1697
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,360
It's like this is normal shit.

1698
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:31,130
Like people laughing right time.

1699
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,580
Then the Ari Shaffir factory.

1700
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:36,560
It just takes a turn almost.

1701
00:43:36,561 --> 00:43:37,394
See the moment.

1702
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:38,630
There you go.

1703
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:39,463
That's it.

1704
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:40,641
Okay.

1705
00:43:40,641 --> 00:43:42,590
So now a chance you guys
lying down and listened.

1706
00:43:42,591 --> 00:43:45,530
He's having such a good time and now
all of a sudden he looks kind of freaked

1707
00:43:45,531 --> 00:43:46,364
out.

1708
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,520
One thing to note is that
the camera's off tilted.

1709
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:51,590
Like why is it not centered?

1710
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,680
This is one of the best advertisements
ever for don't do drugs.

1711
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:55,683
That's what I'm saying.

1712
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:57,410
That's why I think it might be a fake,

1713
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:59,390
but it's really good acting.

1714
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,273
Yeah.

1715
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,593
Okay.

1716
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:04,501
Oh,

1717
00:44:04,501 --> 00:44:05,370
he's breaking windows,

1718
00:44:05,371 --> 00:44:05,531
Bro.

1719
00:44:05,531 --> 00:44:06,364
This ain't fake.

1720
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:06,840
Yeah,

1721
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,673
no way.

1722
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:09,020
No Way.

1723
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:09,260
Yeah.

1724
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,370
And those are trees up there,

1725
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:10,860
man.

1726
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:11,693
You're on the second.

1727
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,453
No Way.

1728
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,150
Yeah.

1729
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:16,100
And then she kind of just comes to it.

1730
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:16,520
It's like,

1731
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,510
Ooh,

1732
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,800
oh my God.

1733
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,641
And then part two,

1734
00:44:19,641 --> 00:44:20,361
you saw part two,

1735
00:44:20,361 --> 00:44:21,080
right?

1736
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,320
Yeah.

1737
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:21,771
Part two.

1738
00:44:21,771 --> 00:44:23,120
She's just totally,

1739
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:23,691
what'd you just say?

1740
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:24,524
Part two.

1741
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:25,820
This is fake,

1742
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,650
but somebody just fake.

1743
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:28,180
Yeah.

1744
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:28,520
Yeah.

1745
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:28,820
That's,

1746
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,230
that's don't do drug video.

1747
00:44:30,231 --> 00:44:30,800
Right.

1748
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,710
This looks fake to me.

1749
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:32,420
Okay.

1750
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:32,730
Um,

1751
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:33,930
I don't like the way he,

1752
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,330
he randomly stumbled into the window.

1753
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,640
I don't like is that the
camera is not centered.

1754
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:39,991
It's,

1755
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:44,350
it's actually so you can see both windows
like the couches to the right of the

1756
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,300
camera and has a camera man.

1757
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,620
If you're sending up yourself record,

1758
00:44:47,621 --> 00:44:49,030
why won't you zoom in on the couch?

1759
00:44:49,031 --> 00:44:50,350
You're not going to sit at that far back.

1760
00:44:50,351 --> 00:44:51,370
And it showed that much window.

1761
00:44:51,371 --> 00:44:53,500
And why is it showing its off centered?

1762
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,450
I always thought it was fake,

1763
00:44:55,451 --> 00:44:57,670
but I wanted to see what you
guys thought as soon as fake.

1764
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,380
The way he moves seems fake.

1765
00:44:59,430 --> 00:44:59,960
Yeah.

1766
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,381
The way he,

1767
00:45:00,381 --> 00:45:02,900
he jumped up the way had jumped up to me,

1768
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,550
looked like he was putting on a show.

1769
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:04,910
Yeah.

1770
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,200
I mean that's the impression that I got.

1771
00:45:06,201 --> 00:45:07,034
I might be wrong,

1772
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:09,440
but my impression was that
he was putting on a show,

1773
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:12,830
a guy who was really scared of when,

1774
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,300
when you're really fucked up,

1775
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:17,430
can you shut that off part isn't
stolen cause you hear talking in the

1776
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:18,264
background.

1777
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,220
Um,

1778
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,980
when you're really fucked up on
something and you can't walk you,

1779
00:45:21,981 --> 00:45:23,450
you don't know how to control your body.

1780
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:26,030
And that guy was like catching
himself the right way.

1781
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,190
He was like saving himself
the right way every time.

1782
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:32,180
To me it looked like he was way more
together than he was pretending to be and

1783
00:45:32,181 --> 00:45:33,560
went right through that window.

1784
00:45:33,561 --> 00:45:34,850
He didn't pull out of it at all.

1785
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:39,500
Like he knows well enough to keep his
balance while he's stumbling around.

1786
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,970
He knows to protect his bounds,

1787
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:42,980
but it doesn't know to
not go through a window.

1788
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:43,903
I don't buy that.

1789
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,630
And you don't buy also falls out
of the top part of the window,

1790
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:51,680
the divided and there's all
this smashing and you know,

1791
00:45:51,681 --> 00:45:53,900
but it doesn't look like
smashing window to me,

1792
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:54,591
you know?

1793
00:45:54,591 --> 00:45:54,861
I mean,

1794
00:45:54,861 --> 00:45:57,260
he just kind of like leaning on and
all of a sudden it's going through.

1795
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,090
What is that?

1796
00:45:59,090 --> 00:45:59,781
That looks fake.

1797
00:45:59,781 --> 00:46:00,614
The window looks fake.

1798
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,960
The fact that he would just go
over it and write through it.

1799
00:46:02,961 --> 00:46:04,010
He wouldn't stop himself.

1800
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:04,993
Come on son.

1801
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,830
And if you noticed,

1802
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:06,050
uh,

1803
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:09,250
when all that was happening
there was off camera a,

1804
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:13,440
he must have hit a light or a lamp
and did the light bulb blow up flash.

1805
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,320
So it was really dramatic
because it was like,

1806
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:15,680
Ooh,

1807
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,850
a light bulb flash.

1808
00:46:16,851 --> 00:46:18,080
And that right there as a,

1809
00:46:18,081 --> 00:46:20,000
as a looking at to me thought,

1810
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:20,241
hey,

1811
00:46:20,241 --> 00:46:23,470
that's purposely put there to make it
more dramatic and realistic looking.

1812
00:46:23,471 --> 00:46:23,780
Right?

1813
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:24,201
Yeah,

1814
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:25,034
maybe right.

1815
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,120
Maybe it wasn't even real.

1816
00:46:26,121 --> 00:46:27,470
Maybe they added it to the film,

1817
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,330
right effect really into it.

1818
00:46:29,331 --> 00:46:30,740
When I saw that you really,

1819
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:31,190
yeah,

1820
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,260
I ran this by it,

1821
00:46:32,261 --> 00:46:32,631
man.

1822
00:46:32,631 --> 00:46:33,400
She'll reaction.

1823
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,041
I'm just being honest.

1824
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:37,160
Was that I thought it was
my first reaction was fake.

1825
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:37,521
Well,

1826
00:46:37,521 --> 00:46:38,210
we might be,

1827
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:38,631
I might be.

1828
00:46:38,631 --> 00:46:39,464
Might be right.

1829
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:39,980
I don't know.

1830
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:40,790
We might be wrong.

1831
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:42,050
It might be a whole new story about it.

1832
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:43,010
Yeah.

1833
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:46,430
If there's not a new story
like immediately because
they want to have a story

1834
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:49,400
like that guy falls breaks
both of his fucking legs.

1835
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:51,171
Dumb ask.

1836
00:46:51,171 --> 00:46:51,411
It's a,

1837
00:46:51,411 --> 00:46:51,751
you know,

1838
00:46:51,751 --> 00:46:53,210
it gets a fence post up his ass.

1839
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,070
What exactly happened
to Ari when he did it?

1840
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:55,630
Wow,

1841
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:57,620
I'm way too much of a freak out.

1842
00:46:57,890 --> 00:46:59,690
He stayed put though pretty much.

1843
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,770
They kind of held them down,

1844
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,390
but there was,

1845
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:05,420
there were watching him and
they were doing it for a show.

1846
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:07,910
They were doing it when they
were filming the naughty show.

1847
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,730
And the worst part about
that is that you know,

1848
00:47:10,731 --> 00:47:10,951
you're,

1849
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:13,880
you're filming it and you're trying to
make light of it and you're making a

1850
00:47:13,881 --> 00:47:15,010
comedy podcasts.

1851
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:15,501
Then you ask,

1852
00:47:15,501 --> 00:47:18,740
you got to do psychedelics and the worst
thing you could do when you're doing

1853
00:47:18,741 --> 00:47:19,371
psychedelics,

1854
00:47:19,371 --> 00:47:22,970
this being on a fucking comedy
podcasts with cameras and people,

1855
00:47:22,971 --> 00:47:23,250
fuck,

1856
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:23,870
let's do you know,

1857
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:24,681
you know the studio,

1858
00:47:24,681 --> 00:47:28,420
it was like everybody had was packed
like three people on the couch.

1859
00:47:28,421 --> 00:47:29,254
There was the people,

1860
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:29,831
me and everything.

1861
00:47:29,831 --> 00:47:29,980
So

1862
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,190
it was like past the worst
place you could ever do a,

1863
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:33,811
I can tell.

1864
00:47:33,811 --> 00:47:38,560
And he started flailing and like I thought
he was not the LCD screen or breaks

1865
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:41,050
hurt himself and he stood
up and it was genuine.

1866
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:41,650
Yeah.

1867
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,040
Oh yeah.

1868
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:42,850
Completely real.

1869
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:43,210
Really.

1870
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:43,990
But he didn't do it.

1871
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:44,823
This knucklehead did.

1872
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:45,940
Did he leave?

1873
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:46,961
He left.

1874
00:47:46,961 --> 00:47:47,560
He,

1875
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:47,891
no,

1876
00:47:47,891 --> 00:47:51,520
he freaked out and then he
cuddled Sam and they was so cute.

1877
00:47:51,521 --> 00:47:51,761
Cause our,

1878
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:53,780
he's a little face was next
to Sam and it looked like

1879
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:55,450
still going on.

1880
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,531
You see it?

1881
00:47:56,531 --> 00:47:56,861
Look,

1882
00:47:56,861 --> 00:47:57,490
there's some,

1883
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:58,323
what the fuck?

1884
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,100
This is bullshit dude.

1885
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:01,031
This is videos.

1886
00:48:01,031 --> 00:48:01,864
Totally bullshit.

1887
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:04,930
They left all this extra footage and
the end of it to make it look even more

1888
00:48:04,931 --> 00:48:05,320
real.

1889
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:05,650
Right.

1890
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:08,260
Could have a clever law is some a,

1891
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:08,861
what's it called?

1892
00:48:08,861 --> 00:48:10,870
I don't think so.

1893
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,310
Blair witch kind of style,

1894
00:48:12,311 --> 00:48:12,550
right?

1895
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:13,383
Yeah.

1896
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:14,200
I'm just,

1897
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:14,621
you know,

1898
00:48:14,621 --> 00:48:15,100
I just,

1899
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:19,000
I see all these fucking hungry kids out
there trying to come up with something

1900
00:48:19,001 --> 00:48:20,350
that gets people to look at their shit.

1901
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:25,530
And I see creativity and ingenuity and
I see a video like this and I said,

1902
00:48:25,531 --> 00:48:27,520
well there it is manifested itself.

1903
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:28,750
Good try guys.

1904
00:48:28,751 --> 00:48:29,584
Very talented.

1905
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:30,911
It was very funny.

1906
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:34,150
But I'm not buying it son.

1907
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:35,500
So crazy.

1908
00:48:35,501 --> 00:48:37,420
Salvia trip schools.

1909
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:39,400
What does it say for real?

1910
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,250
With a bunch is oh that's
how in other ways and why,

1911
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:43,090
you know it's not real yet

1912
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:46,210
cause they don't even save for real
with the correction on the ohs.

1913
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:46,841
Check this out.

1914
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:47,674
She,

1915
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,730
I don't know what's going on.

1916
00:48:48,731 --> 00:48:49,451
I haven't been watching it.

1917
00:48:49,451 --> 00:48:52,780
I just looked over but she just finally
came to it looks like and then she opens

1918
00:48:52,781 --> 00:48:57,500
the front door and then the guy
immediately comes in right when uh,

1919
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:57,820
he,

1920
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,260
she opens the door at the same time.

1921
00:48:59,261 --> 00:49:00,760
Like it wasn't like she opened the door.

1922
00:49:00,761 --> 00:49:03,790
It was like looking around like they
both came to at the same time and met at

1923
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:04,480
the door.

1924
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,620
Maybe this is like the opening scene for
an amazing new film and this is viral

1925
00:49:08,621 --> 00:49:09,170
marketing.

1926
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:10,003
The monkey moon.

1927
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:10,840
This isn't it.

1928
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:11,021
Yeah.

1929
00:49:11,021 --> 00:49:12,940
This is one of the reasons
why you root for the monkeys.

1930
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:13,620
It's called

1931
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,270
people are constantly evidence.

1932
00:49:15,271 --> 00:49:15,931
1 billion,

1933
00:49:15,931 --> 00:49:17,280
226.

1934
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:19,290
It's fucking idiots.

1935
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:20,020
This is Morgan,

1936
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:23,970
Salvia head headers out
windows marketing campaigns.

1937
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:25,621
This.

1938
00:49:25,621 --> 00:49:28,830
He tried to really pump up the numbers
for the planet of the apes because you've

1939
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,300
got to realize we lose in this one.

1940
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:31,231
We lose this one.

1941
00:49:31,231 --> 00:49:33,980
We lose this one big fucking
the chimps take over.

1942
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:34,920
Yeah,

1943
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,440
I was going to be some violence scenes.

1944
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:37,460
I can't wait.

1945
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,050
I hope so.

1946
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:40,040
It's in three D is that even
in three D it's going to be,

1947
00:49:40,041 --> 00:49:41,030
everything's in three d now,

1948
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:41,780
son.

1949
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,890
Like that shit like in the three d.

1950
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:44,121
Yeah,

1951
00:49:44,121 --> 00:49:44,480
me too.

1952
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,530
There'll be a shot of somebody like a
monkey's going to grab a guy's ear and

1953
00:49:48,531 --> 00:49:50,290
it's going to tear across as fake things.

1954
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:52,370
Oh yes dude.

1955
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:53,960
Is it supposed to be this violent?

1956
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:54,900
I'm hoping I'm

1957
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:57,920
putting it out there in the universe.

1958
00:49:58,190 --> 00:49:59,090
I have made it to kids.

1959
00:49:59,091 --> 00:49:59,361
Maybe.

1960
00:49:59,361 --> 00:49:59,841
Maybe they,

1961
00:49:59,841 --> 00:50:01,250
it's a monkey story.

1962
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:05,960
It's gotta be at least PG 13 I would
imagine a big budget movie like this.

1963
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,340
Probably PG 13 what do you think
that Captain America actually,

1964
00:50:09,341 --> 00:50:10,220
I think it looks decent.

1965
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:14,480
It looks bad ass fucking love
superhero movies doing shit though.

1966
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,040
Did you see it there?

1967
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,980
Ryan rounds is a bit too
handsome for my taste.

1968
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:18,830
Green Horn.

1969
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:23,330
I'm not into watching him wander around
on TV knowing that he fucked the shit

1970
00:50:23,331 --> 00:50:23,811
out of scarlet.

1971
00:50:23,811 --> 00:50:26,230
Johannson it was like
kind of done with you

1972
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:28,250
moving

1973
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,270
on to greener pastures.

1974
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,430
You,

1975
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:31,971
it sucks.

1976
00:50:31,971 --> 00:50:36,410
A six flags made a new roller coaster and
it's not even Ryan Reynolds Pussy riot

1977
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:38,483
jumping.

1978
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,300
You're jumping a condom.

1979
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:44,390
You go just fucking shooting through all
these pussies all throughout Hollywood.

1980
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:48,650
Just fucking exhausted,

1981
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,330
covered it

1982
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:50,163
verb.

1983
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,530
It's kind of like it turns into knew

1984
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,860
a water right at the very end.

1985
00:50:53,861 --> 00:50:55,360
You get to court kind.

1986
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:56,740
She comes to the end.

1987
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:59,950
The last girl comes and shoots you
over the top of a fucking mountain.

1988
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,230
That dude's got a sweat himself so hard.

1989
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:03,160
How could he not?

1990
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,690
Of course you've got the craziest
roll the dice ever handsome.

1991
00:51:06,691 --> 00:51:09,640
Well spoken people like funny,

1992
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:10,850
funny,

1993
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:11,683
really funny.

1994
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,820
Good look and it's fucking nailing it.

1995
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:14,703
Sun,

1996
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:15,410
sweat,

1997
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:16,070
sweat.

1998
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,090
You mother fucker.

1999
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:21,460
Dude apparently just usurped a
Jennifer Lopez and I heard this news.

2000
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,160
No,

2001
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:22,660
just could not.

2002
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:23,320
Maybe true.

2003
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:23,950
Maybe not.

2004
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:25,870
Maybe I heard it from somebody.

2005
00:51:25,871 --> 00:51:28,180
Read it on the Internet and Internet and
I haven't even bothered looking at it

2006
00:51:28,181 --> 00:51:28,600
up,

2007
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,680
but apparently Jennifer Lopez gotten
some sort of a romantic soiree.

2008
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,221
Ooh.

2009
00:51:33,221 --> 00:51:35,350
With some dude who she was dancing with.

2010
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,830
Now all of a sudden our fucking shows
become TMZ cause I need to find out if

2011
00:51:38,831 --> 00:51:39,370
that's true,

2012
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:41,620
that Green Hornet Roller
coasters and even open yet.

2013
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,470
Can you imagine him like they spent all
this money on this roller coaster and

2014
00:51:44,471 --> 00:51:44,710
they're like,

2015
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:45,191
Oh God,

2016
00:51:45,191 --> 00:51:46,024
that movie was gay.

2017
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,051
I mean bad.

2018
00:51:47,051 --> 00:51:48,500
And then we have to do it.

2019
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:50,560
Announcing a split to sing at a wedding.

2020
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,780
Six is that a six flags?

2021
00:51:52,781 --> 00:51:54,430
Ryan's going to be six flags.

2022
00:51:54,431 --> 00:51:54,611
It's not,

2023
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,650
I don't even think it's so funny.

2024
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,860
What's the other superhero one?

2025
00:51:56,861 --> 00:51:57,710
What's the one that stuck around?

2026
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,760
Seth Rogen black.

2027
00:52:00,761 --> 00:52:01,594
Worn it.

2028
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,990
Jennifer Lopez still
fucking keeps it together.

2029
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:05,320
Oh,

2030
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:05,830
green horn.

2031
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:08,050
Greenlanders this is why I
knew this is why I needed this.

2032
00:52:08,051 --> 00:52:09,160
Marriage was never going to work.

2033
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:09,941
Why?

2034
00:52:09,941 --> 00:52:10,510
What is it?

2035
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:11,320
She's too hot.

2036
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,220
She is still hot.

2037
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:12,911
She's still hot.

2038
00:52:12,911 --> 00:52:13,571
It's Jennifer Lopez.

2039
00:52:13,571 --> 00:52:14,351
She's like 50 now,

2040
00:52:14,351 --> 00:52:14,561
right?

2041
00:52:14,561 --> 00:52:14,891
What is she?

2042
00:52:14,891 --> 00:52:15,650
How old is she now?

2043
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:16,600
She's 86 years old.

2044
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:19,480
She's 97 years old and she's hot as fuck.

2045
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:20,440
She's younger than me.

2046
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,490
I shouldn't be talking shit.

2047
00:52:21,491 --> 00:52:23,200
She's only 41 but God damn,

2048
00:52:23,201 --> 00:52:24,160
she's still hot as fuck,

2049
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:27,160
and that dude that she's
with that Mark Anthony Fella,

2050
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:28,840
he's got a music looker.

2051
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:30,100
He's got a mirror at home.

2052
00:52:30,101 --> 00:52:33,580
He knows what the fuck is up when he
needs to do with belt out some God down

2053
00:52:33,581 --> 00:52:34,414
number one hits.

2054
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:36,490
It's the only way he's going to
keep around and let's be honest,

2055
00:52:36,491 --> 00:52:37,720
he really hasn't done that lately.

2056
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:39,070
I haven't been hearing,

2057
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:42,340
nobody's been screaming and yelling
about how great Marc Anthony's music is.

2058
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:48,090
Unless you are one of the baddest
motherfuckers ever you Justin Bieber and

2059
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:51,460
prince rolled up in one
and you look like that.

2060
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,950
It's going to be hard to keep a
girl like Jennifer Lopez for sure.

2061
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,330
Those are some genetic son.

2062
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:57,370
Those are some I need Dick Genetics.

2063
00:52:57,830 --> 00:52:58,530
He I'm saying,

2064
00:52:58,530 --> 00:52:58,930
yeah,

2065
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:00,070
he's a look at that.

2066
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:01,030
Look at that girl's body.

2067
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:01,750
Where's that from?

2068
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:02,350
What's that?

2069
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:05,410
That that body's a goddamn
homing signal for a cock.

2070
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:06,400
I'm Puerto Rican.

2071
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,073
It's all good though.

2072
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,030
A magnet for a dick.

2073
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:10,450
Yeah,

2074
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:11,283
that's what it is.

2075
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,490
Puerto Rican Dix hills.

2076
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,270
Sampson.

2077
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:13,660
Yeah,

2078
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:14,620
that's what I'm talking about.

2079
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:15,513
Yep.

2080
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:16,781
Couldn't,

2081
00:53:16,781 --> 00:53:17,650
she couldn't keep it together.

2082
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,000
She uh,

2083
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,070
she hooked up with some other
dude can imagine how many,

2084
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:25,590
how many guys fucking rail and smash
that when she was one of the girls

2085
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,170
Don Johnson hop arguing.

2086
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:29,610
They argued for months.

2087
00:53:29,611 --> 00:53:30,090
Nonstop.

2088
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:31,140
That makes me so sad.

2089
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:31,500
Yeah.

2090
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,140
Why argue you guys have
all the money in the world.

2091
00:53:34,141 --> 00:53:34,974
They have a kid,

2092
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,960
they have twins,

2093
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:36,170
right?

2094
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:36,870
Yeah.

2095
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:39,630
What do I give a fuck when people
are listening to his podcasts going,

2096
00:53:39,631 --> 00:53:40,490
what do you give a fuck?

2097
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:41,341
Listen,

2098
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:42,060
I don't,

2099
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,100
and I blamed the weed and Oprah.

2100
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:44,761
I believe him.

2101
00:53:44,761 --> 00:53:46,690
The weed on me as if it
wasn't for the weekend.

2102
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:47,790
I would not be on a,

2103
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:48,360
uh,

2104
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:53,130
Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez
swit split Google run right now.

2105
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:53,911
Yeah,

2106
00:53:53,911 --> 00:53:54,420
man.

2107
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,440
You ever get an a Google run?

2108
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:55,981
And he'd go,

2109
00:53:55,981 --> 00:53:57,420
what the fuck is wrong with me,

2110
00:53:57,421 --> 00:53:57,750
man?

2111
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:58,470
Yeah.

2112
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:00,600
I'm thinking about getting
one of these Mac book airs.

2113
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:00,871
Good,

2114
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:01,081
good,

2115
00:54:01,081 --> 00:54:01,261
good.

2116
00:54:01,261 --> 00:54:01,680
Get One.

2117
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,513
So before we,

2118
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,890
we didn't finish this Macha Picchu thing,

2119
00:54:04,891 --> 00:54:05,400
man.

2120
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:05,641
Oh,

2121
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:07,410
I'm looking at some
photos of this shit now.

2122
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:08,361
Tell me you,

2123
00:54:08,361 --> 00:54:08,640
you,

2124
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:08,910
you,

2125
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:10,200
we kept getting off track.

2126
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:11,850
W you got there,

2127
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:13,110
you fly to Cusco flag.

2128
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:15,690
Who's Colima and you stay there.

2129
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:20,070
Usually most people stay there at least
like a day or two to get acclimated to,

2130
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,120
you know,

2131
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:21,953
being up that high.

2132
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:22,380
Right.

2133
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:27,380
And then you take a train from Cusco to
what is essentially the bottom of the

2134
00:54:28,051 --> 00:54:29,970
mountain that Machu Picchu is on.

2135
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:31,980
And then you take a bus up the hill.

2136
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,600
He'd be very unsafe.

2137
00:54:33,601 --> 00:54:34,110
Bus Ride,

2138
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:34,943
might I add?

2139
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,630
Is it like one of those things with us?

2140
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,270
There's a road and then this
mountain to the righthand side.

2141
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:40,020
Dude,

2142
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:40,500
you're,

2143
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,710
you're on a road that's on the side
of a mountain with no guard rails or

2144
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:46,500
anything in on a bus just going up,

2145
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:46,771
up,

2146
00:54:46,771 --> 00:54:47,011
up,

2147
00:54:47,011 --> 00:54:47,844
and you're just like,

2148
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,073
we're on a mountain.

2149
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,370
That kind of thing.

2150
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,630
That stuff where you can look,

2151
00:54:51,631 --> 00:54:54,570
you can look out of your bus
window and just see down.

2152
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:54,781
Yeah.

2153
00:54:54,781 --> 00:54:56,130
Your bus driver falls asleep.

2154
00:54:56,131 --> 00:54:56,880
Freaks out.

2155
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,713
Yeah,

2156
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:58,830
whatever.

2157
00:54:58,830 --> 00:54:59,670
Had a long night,

2158
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,320
a dog runs across the road,

2159
00:55:01,321 --> 00:55:02,430
he has to hit the brakes.

2160
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:04,170
Drinks just does anything.

2161
00:55:04,171 --> 00:55:05,370
Jesus Christ.

2162
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:05,790
Yeah.

2163
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:06,750
It's not like,

2164
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:07,500
oh,

2165
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:07,821
how,

2166
00:55:07,821 --> 00:55:09,300
how wide is the road not wide.

2167
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:11,090
Oh yeah.

2168
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:16,910
I did the Pacific coast highway
once the drive from California,

2169
00:55:17,071 --> 00:55:18,110
from southern California,

2170
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:19,920
northern California along the coast.

2171
00:55:19,921 --> 00:55:21,390
It's fucking amazing.

2172
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:22,560
Amazing.

2173
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,480
While you're driving now you just like,

2174
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:25,201
oh my God,

2175
00:55:25,201 --> 00:55:26,250
this is so incredible.

2176
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:31,430
But you can't even look at it because
you're glued that little skinny slice of

2177
00:55:31,651 --> 00:55:34,590
rock hanging over the Pacific Ocean,

2178
00:55:34,591 --> 00:55:34,921
by the way,

2179
00:55:34,921 --> 00:55:37,530
in a place where the
ground moves all the time.

2180
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:38,070
Yeah.

2181
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:40,200
And you're driving 35 miles an hour.

2182
00:55:40,201 --> 00:55:41,190
You can't drive any faster.

2183
00:55:41,191 --> 00:55:42,510
Cause he's a fucking
person in front of you.

2184
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,141
And by the way,

2185
00:55:43,141 --> 00:55:43,441
when you're,

2186
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:46,530
you're in a cooperative agreement with
all those other fuck sticks on that road.

2187
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:46,880
Yeah.

2188
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:47,041
You know,

2189
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:50,130
you got to know that this guy come in
this way isn't just freaking out and

2190
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:54,330
stomping on his gas and turning into
traffic because his girlfriend left him

2191
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:54,730
right now.

2192
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:58,200
You gotta you gotta hope that everyone
you meet is keeping it together.

2193
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,400
Fuck that and fuck man,

2194
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:04,470
it's terrifying because you
don't have to take that.

2195
00:56:04,471 --> 00:56:04,640
Okay,

2196
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,620
well here's a quicker route is
actually to not take when I want to.

2197
00:56:07,621 --> 00:56:10,740
Taking that route on the
ocean is just the scenic view.

2198
00:56:10,741 --> 00:56:11,400
So we,

2199
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,780
I did it once with an
ex girlfriend of mine.

2200
00:56:12,781 --> 00:56:14,620
I got a ticket going up and to going.

2201
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:17,580
How long does it speed trap because
they know you want to drive home.

2202
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:18,000
Yeah.

2203
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,481
I mean again,

2204
00:56:18,481 --> 00:56:18,690
you know,

2205
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:21,900
he lives out there so it's all just
people driving from San Francisco to La

2206
00:56:21,901 --> 00:56:22,501
along the coast.

2207
00:56:22,501 --> 00:56:24,160
So it's crazy speed traps.

2208
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,053
How long does that take?

2209
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:25,841
So long time.

2210
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:26,440
I don't remember.

2211
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,820
It's like somewhere around six hours.

2212
00:56:27,821 --> 00:56:29,680
I think it was somewhere around that.

2213
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:30,120
And that's it.

2214
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:30,910
If you're,

2215
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:31,300
you know,

2216
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,770
following a reasonable pace.

2217
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,281
We actually,

2218
00:56:33,281 --> 00:56:34,390
I think went to Monterey,

2219
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,370
that's where we went and then
went to San Francisco later.

2220
00:56:36,371 --> 00:56:37,900
But it's not worth the drive.

2221
00:56:37,901 --> 00:56:39,370
It's a fucking cunt of a drive.

2222
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,070
Yeah.

2223
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:40,903
Yeah.

2224
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,370
That takes way longer.

2225
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:43,181
But the coast,

2226
00:56:43,181 --> 00:56:44,410
but the Machu Picchu things.

2227
00:56:44,411 --> 00:56:46,140
So you're on this road here on this road,

2228
00:56:46,141 --> 00:56:49,330
there's no guard rail and just like that
where it's a skinny road on the side of

2229
00:56:49,331 --> 00:56:50,081
a giant mountain.

2230
00:56:50,081 --> 00:56:51,100
You're in the driver's hands,

2231
00:56:51,101 --> 00:56:53,650
like how long from the time
that you land in the plane,

2232
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:55,960
how long before you actually
get to the top and this bus?

2233
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:56,590
Well,

2234
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:56,951
you land,

2235
00:56:56,951 --> 00:56:57,311
like I said,

2236
00:56:57,311 --> 00:56:58,031
you land in Cusco.

2237
00:56:58,031 --> 00:57:00,160
Usually I stay there a day or two.

2238
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,050
Then take a train.

2239
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:04,240
It's a couple hour train
ride I want to say.

2240
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:06,070
Do you stay there on purpose to normalize?

2241
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:06,640
Yeah,

2242
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,240
most people do.

2243
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,073
Most people do.

2244
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:08,441
Yeah,

2245
00:57:08,441 --> 00:57:12,070
because also since you already
flew in to Cusco that day,

2246
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:16,060
you probably usually don't feel like
taking the train because the best time to

2247
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:17,470
goes in the morning to get the whole day.

2248
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:18,340
So you,

2249
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,390
you stay a couple of days,

2250
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:20,650
you get on a train,

2251
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:21,911
you take the train ride,

2252
00:57:21,911 --> 00:57:23,230
then you get the bus up the hill,

2253
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:25,270
and then when you arrive at the,

2254
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:25,801
you arrive at,

2255
00:57:25,801 --> 00:57:25,960
at,

2256
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:29,890
at the top and you are just a,

2257
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:30,690
you know,

2258
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:34,270
let's say a hundred yards or something
from where the actual Machu Picchu,

2259
00:57:34,271 --> 00:57:34,931
the city as you're at,

2260
00:57:34,931 --> 00:57:37,690
you're at the receiving area
and you walk over and it's,

2261
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:39,040
it just blows your mind,

2262
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:39,191
man.

2263
00:57:39,191 --> 00:57:39,731
There's nothing,

2264
00:57:39,731 --> 00:57:40,520
I mean there's,

2265
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,680
there's no way to describe it.

2266
00:57:41,681 --> 00:57:43,000
There's a city,

2267
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:45,490
an ancient city way up,

2268
00:57:45,491 --> 00:57:46,600
thousands of feet,

2269
00:57:46,601 --> 00:57:51,601
7,000 feet up in the
mountains and it's elaborate.

2270
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,110
It's precise.

2271
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,540
There's reasons for the
placement of things.

2272
00:57:55,541 --> 00:57:57,220
The Sun hits certain parts of it,

2273
00:57:57,221 --> 00:57:58,031
certain ways,

2274
00:57:58,031 --> 00:57:59,140
and you're just like,

2275
00:57:59,141 --> 00:57:59,351
we're,

2276
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:00,310
we're way up.

2277
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:01,410
You know,

2278
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:05,470
like you're looking down from the top
of a mountain in a city and there it was

2279
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:08,260
inhabited and fully
functioning and you know,

2280
00:58:08,261 --> 00:58:08,980
it's just,

2281
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:09,510
like I said,

2282
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:10,690
the size of the place,

2283
00:58:10,691 --> 00:58:11,920
of the magnitude of it all,

2284
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:13,081
it blows your mind.

2285
00:58:13,081 --> 00:58:13,330
It's,

2286
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:14,290
there's nothing like event.

2287
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:15,930
How long were you up there for?

2288
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:17,590
I would spend,

2289
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:19,420
you know,

2290
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:20,171
hours like,

2291
00:58:20,171 --> 00:58:20,500
uh,

2292
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,820
you arrive in the morning,

2293
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:24,470
let's say you're there by like a guide
or something like that takes you yeah.

2294
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:24,801
And they,

2295
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:26,720
and they have so much information.

2296
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:27,401
Blows your mind.

2297
00:58:27,401 --> 00:58:28,990
Like how old did they say it is?

2298
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:30,143
Ah,

2299
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,210
I'm trying to remember.

2300
00:58:31,211 --> 00:58:33,640
I haven't been there in a while now,

2301
00:58:33,641 --> 00:58:37,600
but I want to say that they said well
because it's documented when the Spanish

2302
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:42,100
went there and killed like thousands
of them with like a hundred guys,

2303
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:42,850
you know,

2304
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:43,683
because uh,

2305
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:47,110
they came with disease and weapon
and they just wiped them out.

2306
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:50,340
I was in Hawaii last week and uh,

2307
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:51,460
we were reading about,

2308
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:51,760
um,

2309
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,061
when,

2310
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:54,190
when white people first came to Hawaii,

2311
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:57,700
it killed off one fifth of
the Hawaiian population.

2312
00:58:57,730 --> 00:58:58,141
Damn.

2313
00:58:58,141 --> 00:58:59,550
Cause that's these people.

2314
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:00,330
One fifth.

2315
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:00,700
Yeah.

2316
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:03,730
Can you imagine how much you would fucking
hate white people if they showed up

2317
00:59:03,731 --> 00:59:07,570
and your daughter died from measles
because these creeps brought over some

2318
00:59:07,571 --> 00:59:08,800
creepy fucking disease.

2319
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:09,570
Yeah.

2320
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:09,860
It's,

2321
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,200
it's,

2322
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:10,620
it's,

2323
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:10,831
I mean,

2324
00:59:10,831 --> 00:59:11,180
it,

2325
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:11,710
it,

2326
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:11,921
it's,

2327
00:59:11,921 --> 00:59:13,150
well that's well documented.

2328
00:59:13,151 --> 00:59:13,930
We could look that up.

2329
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:14,763
It's,

2330
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,300
I want to say they,

2331
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:19,750
it was like thousands to
one that they killed them.

2332
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:22,280
And that was in the 15.

2333
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,300
I want to say 15,

2334
00:59:23,301 --> 00:59:24,410
13 or 15 to 60.

2335
00:59:24,411 --> 00:59:25,041
Something like that.

2336
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:26,180
Just make some shit up bro.

2337
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,450
No one's going to go and look it up.

2338
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:28,010
Fucking,

2339
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:28,850
I was going to Google it.

2340
00:59:28,851 --> 00:59:29,220
Yes.

2341
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,053
They,

2342
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:32,510
I'm not an expert.

2343
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:33,300
So,

2344
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:33,920
um,

2345
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:34,760
when you go up there,

2346
00:59:34,761 --> 00:59:35,930
so they give you some sort of a,

2347
00:59:35,931 --> 00:59:37,760
an estimation of when it was created,

2348
00:59:37,761 --> 00:59:40,610
did they tell you who the people
were or why they built it?

2349
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:41,991
They give you,

2350
00:59:41,991 --> 00:59:42,740
it's all theories.

2351
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:43,001
There's,

2352
00:59:43,001 --> 00:59:44,120
it's never been discovered.

2353
00:59:44,121 --> 00:59:46,420
And they tell you that their
theories because that you,

2354
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:50,480
there's no record to prove that this
was in fact the way they did it.

2355
00:59:50,481 --> 00:59:51,080
But like,

2356
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,550
so was it one thing sorta when they,

2357
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:53,660
they're just sort of found it.

2358
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:54,110
Yeah.

2359
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:54,830
Yeah.

2360
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:55,280
It was,

2361
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:59,420
it was discovered in the early 19
hundreds by like an explorer and American

2362
00:59:59,421 --> 00:59:59,811
explorer,

2363
00:59:59,811 --> 01:00:00,390
I think,

2364
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:02,060
kind a British and he,

2365
01:00:02,061 --> 01:00:02,241
uh,

2366
01:00:02,241 --> 01:00:02,451
you know,

2367
01:00:02,451 --> 01:00:02,751
it had,

2368
01:00:02,751 --> 01:00:03,710
it was overgrown,

2369
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:06,110
like weeds and grass and
everything had to grown.

2370
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:06,890
And then,

2371
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:07,131
yeah.

2372
01:00:07,131 --> 01:00:09,950
Can you imagine you're on a hike and
then they take you to see this and you're

2373
01:00:09,951 --> 01:00:10,161
like,

2374
01:00:10,161 --> 01:00:12,050
what the fuck man,

2375
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,380
but a sudden you just find some lost city,

2376
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,470
the lost city man from thousands
of years ago where yield loss.

2377
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,270
I wish I could remember what the,

2378
01:00:20,271 --> 01:00:21,104
uh,

2379
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:25,730
the chariots of the gods slash
Graham Hancock crew thinks,

2380
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:25,960
uh,

2381
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,340
about this place because
I think there's some,

2382
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:31,430
there is some sort of speculation that
it was at the side of water at one point

2383
01:00:31,431 --> 01:00:32,000
in time.

2384
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:32,420
Really?

2385
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:32,920
Yeah.

2386
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:33,591
That you know,

2387
01:00:33,591 --> 01:00:37,100
that the topography of the earth was so
radically different when this thing was

2388
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:40,280
created that it's so many thousands of
years old that there was actually a water

2389
01:00:40,281 --> 01:00:43,400
up there with this guy wants to
do is as John Anthony West Guy,

2390
01:00:43,401 --> 01:00:48,401
he wants to push back the
idea of civilization like
more like more than 10,000

2391
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:48,861
BC.

2392
01:00:48,861 --> 01:00:49,880
He wants to go like way back,

2393
01:00:49,881 --> 01:00:54,881
even like 30,000 BC and he thinks that
theirs is sort of a hieroglyphs that

2394
01:00:55,431 --> 01:00:56,181
represent that.

2395
01:00:56,181 --> 01:00:57,680
But for whatever reasons,

2396
01:00:57,710 --> 01:01:01,520
Egyptian scholars of refuse to look at
those hieroglyphs and they believe that

2397
01:01:01,521 --> 01:01:04,940
it's all fiction after a certain point
and it's just a fiction and fable.

2398
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:05,661
When he's saying,

2399
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:05,871
well,

2400
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:06,860
why would you think that?

2401
01:01:06,861 --> 01:01:09,950
Because there's all this other
evidence that we know is real.

2402
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:11,300
It's also in the hieroglyphs.

2403
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:11,661
Why wouldn't,

2404
01:01:11,661 --> 01:01:13,970
why would we assume that at one
point in time they were just liars,

2405
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:14,380
you know?

2406
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:14,690
Yeah.

2407
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:15,410
So it's Kinda,

2408
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:17,000
did you fuck this new one up again?

2409
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:19,550
It's still broken.

2410
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:20,480
We got to number one though.

2411
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:21,480
I know it never really,

2412
01:01:21,481 --> 01:01:22,480
the new one doesn't work either.

2413
01:01:22,481 --> 01:01:23,880
Now God damn it son.

2414
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,273
Anyway,

2415
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:26,973
those guys are right.

2416
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,830
And it was like 30,000 years ago or
whatever the hell it was where there was a

2417
01:01:30,831 --> 01:01:34,100
civilization up here and there was an
ocean up there or river or whatever the

2418
01:01:34,101 --> 01:01:34,930
hell it was.

2419
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:35,160
Is it,

2420
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,020
and it's not near Ocean,

2421
01:01:36,021 --> 01:01:36,350
right?

2422
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:37,040
No,

2423
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:37,371
I mean,

2424
01:01:37,371 --> 01:01:37,730
you know,

2425
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:38,000
no,

2426
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,530
not,

2427
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:40,490
I would have to be some giant
lake or something out there,

2428
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:44,270
but they have one of their theories is
that they used water to lay those rocks

2429
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:48,140
and to make them to shape them
like through some extremely,

2430
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:49,430
you know,

2431
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:49,760
I dunno.

2432
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,790
Intricate formula that water,

2433
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,990
cause you know like water hits,

2434
01:01:53,991 --> 01:01:55,490
rocks and shapes them over time.

2435
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:55,770
Right.

2436
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:56,900
To beat them down to sand.

2437
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:02,200
They have a theory that that water was
used to make rocks like this fit into

2438
01:02:02,961 --> 01:02:03,710
each other.

2439
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:05,520
But there's some
elaborate system that you,

2440
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:06,890
you hear about it and you go like,

2441
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:07,491
yeah,

2442
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:08,271
I don't fucking know man.

2443
01:02:08,271 --> 01:02:08,960
That's pretty,

2444
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,600
the sheer size of them is
what's really mind boggling.

2445
01:02:11,601 --> 01:02:12,790
It really has been there.

2446
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:13,251
The eight,

2447
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:15,860
nine feet tall and
they're curved and they,

2448
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:20,710
and they fit into other curved garage
and thousands of thousand tons.

2449
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:21,280
Yeah.

2450
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:21,520
Yeah.

2451
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,300
I mean,

2452
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:23,610
I don't know thousands of times.

2453
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:24,653
What's the biggest one?

2454
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:25,830
I should know this.

2455
01:02:25,831 --> 01:02:27,120
We should know that we're talking shit,

2456
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:27,640
but they,

2457
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:27,990
there are,

2458
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:29,430
there are enormous stones up there.

2459
01:02:29,431 --> 01:02:30,270
Whatever the fuck it is.

2460
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,040
I highly recommend a trip there.

2461
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,050
You're making me want to go.

2462
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:35,080
I really it so far.

2463
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:37,110
When you land in the
morning at this one place,

2464
01:02:37,111 --> 01:02:37,651
before you,

2465
01:02:37,651 --> 01:02:39,510
before you get in the
bus and all the jazz,

2466
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:40,860
when you land in the morning,

2467
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,000
do they give you like,

2468
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:44,340
like a survival pack or anything?

2469
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:45,390
These things,

2470
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:46,320
here's water.

2471
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:47,970
You're at high altitude.

2472
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:48,930
Well when you land in Cusco,

2473
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:49,141
yeah.

2474
01:02:49,141 --> 01:02:49,500
Everyone,

2475
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,720
like if you're never been
there like hotels will,

2476
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:52,591
we'll give you tea.

2477
01:02:52,591 --> 01:02:53,424
They'll give you,

2478
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:53,791
you know,

2479
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:55,080
trying to keep telling you to hydrate.

2480
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:55,591
Yeah.

2481
01:02:55,591 --> 01:02:56,011
Everybody,

2482
01:02:56,011 --> 01:02:56,844
I mean it's,

2483
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:57,833
you know,

2484
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:58,380
peruse,

2485
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:59,370
considered a third world,

2486
01:02:59,371 --> 01:03:00,270
but like it's,

2487
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,430
it's actually really developed now.

2488
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:02,940
Yeah,

2489
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:03,241
this is,

2490
01:03:03,241 --> 01:03:03,421
yeah.

2491
01:03:03,421 --> 01:03:07,950
And this is such a international
destination that like everything is like

2492
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:08,580
modern,

2493
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:08,881
you know,

2494
01:03:08,881 --> 01:03:10,920
like as far as getting you there.

2495
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:14,300
And I mean the last time I went
was 10 years ago and you know,

2496
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:15,750
it was still pretty much,

2497
01:03:15,751 --> 01:03:18,330
but there's a hotel at the location
if you want to stay over night,

2498
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,010
there's a hotel right there.

2499
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:21,600
So like not like,

2500
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:22,050
you know,

2501
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:23,790
not within the city of Machu Picchu,

2502
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:24,480
but right.

2503
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,860
Kind of not far from it.

2504
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:30,960
So you can stay in the hotel like it's
very not ghost in the middle of the

2505
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:31,150
night.

2506
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:35,100
It's sword fights and thousands
years ago really like affects you.

2507
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,540
It affects you really.

2508
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:37,080
Yeah.

2509
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:37,291
Yeah.

2510
01:03:37,291 --> 01:03:37,810
Like you,

2511
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:38,970
you stay in there and you take it in.

2512
01:03:38,971 --> 01:03:42,570
You're looking at it like you're looking
at the sky and the mountains and you're

2513
01:03:42,571 --> 01:03:43,404
like,

2514
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:43,830
what?

2515
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:45,450
Like how is this possible?

2516
01:03:45,451 --> 01:03:45,811
Cause it,

2517
01:03:45,811 --> 01:03:46,260
it,

2518
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:47,190
it blows your mind.

2519
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:51,450
And in terms of like most
things that you look at,

2520
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:54,600
there's so many like
explanations and answers for,

2521
01:03:54,601 --> 01:03:55,890
and this is something
where they're really,

2522
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:57,060
you really don't have one.

2523
01:03:57,061 --> 01:03:57,894
Like you can't,

2524
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:02,310
you can't have somebody to tell
you this is exactly what this was.

2525
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:06,060
So it then why did he say he can't
just because it's just too nutty,

2526
01:04:06,061 --> 01:04:07,060
too big because,

2527
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:09,060
and because there's no proof that,

2528
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,300
that it was used for this
and it was built this way.

2529
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:13,290
They're all theories,

2530
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:14,730
theories on why this was done.

2531
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:16,830
And so that then opens
your mind up to like,

2532
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,170
really what are possibilities?

2533
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:19,471
I think,

2534
01:04:19,471 --> 01:04:19,711
you know,

2535
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:21,660
like what are possibilities in the world?

2536
01:04:21,661 --> 01:04:22,494
Like,

2537
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:22,830
you know,

2538
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:24,990
what are the possibilities
that you got from,

2539
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:26,640
from being there looking at that,

2540
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,361
just that,

2541
01:04:27,361 --> 01:04:28,320
that um,

2542
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,450
it was underwater and mermaids built it.

2543
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:30,860
Uh,

2544
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:32,820
I just got that it was something that,

2545
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:33,241
uh,

2546
01:04:33,241 --> 01:04:34,074
you know,

2547
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:39,250
that it's greater than what
my mind can conceive of a,

2548
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:43,170
it makes you feel like really small,

2549
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:43,531
you know,

2550
01:04:43,531 --> 01:04:43,671
in,

2551
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:46,170
in a lot of terms like
just by the scope of it.

2552
01:04:46,171 --> 01:04:47,580
And like if,

2553
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:52,640
if this was done by some intricate like
Levy and pulling system with water like

2554
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:54,180
men,

2555
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:55,530
how little do I know?

2556
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:56,753
Like how,

2557
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:58,140
how,

2558
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:02,760
how little have I taken in that people
that were in an ancient civilization

2559
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:05,610
built a city up like my,

2560
01:05:05,611 --> 01:05:05,911
like,

2561
01:05:05,911 --> 01:05:10,440
am I have the lowest Iq level
possible because this is,

2562
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:10,891
I,

2563
01:05:10,891 --> 01:05:11,131
you know,

2564
01:05:11,131 --> 01:05:12,470
you could explain it to me 20 times.

2565
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:12,811
I'd be like,

2566
01:05:12,811 --> 01:05:13,644
what?

2567
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,350
I don't understand what
you're saying right now.

2568
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,050
Like really like,

2569
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:17,261
you know,

2570
01:05:17,261 --> 01:05:17,621
you go,

2571
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:18,454
that's,

2572
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:20,290
and then also you think about,

2573
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,940
I think you think about
like spiritual thing.

2574
01:05:21,941 --> 01:05:24,220
Like you definitely feel something like,

2575
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:24,521
you know,

2576
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:28,810
you think about God and possibilities
of Gods and stuff mean these people all

2577
01:05:28,811 --> 01:05:29,644
worshiped.

2578
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:30,703
Um,

2579
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:33,040
I believe the sun and other gods,

2580
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:33,310
you know,

2581
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:34,750
and cause did so,

2582
01:05:34,751 --> 01:05:35,350
you know,

2583
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:38,800
they were just doing this for
what they believed was God,

2584
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:39,320
you know,

2585
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:42,490
worshiping him or they
sacrificed and could sacrificed.

2586
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:46,000
Do you know they would kill
their own offer him up.

2587
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,710
Jesus Christ.

2588
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:48,603
Yeah.

2589
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:49,361
It's pretty amazing,

2590
01:05:49,361 --> 01:05:49,890
man.

2591
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:51,780
I wonder what made them
build those things.

2592
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:52,251
So when,

2593
01:05:52,251 --> 01:05:52,480
when,

2594
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:57,480
what I would think as far as it being
very spiritual to be there and the terms

2595
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:02,760
of what I mean by spiritual is that if
a spirit was real and if there is some

2596
01:06:04,111 --> 01:06:06,070
sort of an energy that's
inside of a life form,

2597
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:10,230
that energy like leaves and stays in
that space once the person's gone.

2598
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,450
When you go to a place
like a Machu Picchu,

2599
01:06:12,451 --> 01:06:16,110
when you think about all of the thousands
of years of history and all the people

2600
01:06:16,111 --> 01:06:16,944
that have died,

2601
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:19,330
all the people that died
in that area and what,

2602
01:06:19,331 --> 01:06:19,590
what,

2603
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:24,590
you know how long ago it was like if there
was ever any feeling you could get of

2604
01:06:26,221 --> 01:06:27,630
like the spirit of a place,

2605
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:30,270
it would have to be
some sort of an really,

2606
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,980
really ancient place.

2607
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:33,071
You know,

2608
01:06:33,071 --> 01:06:33,101
a,

2609
01:06:33,101 --> 01:06:35,580
a place along those lines like standing,

2610
01:06:35,581 --> 01:06:40,581
like we're Troy is walking around the
coliseum and the touching the Parthenon,

2611
01:06:41,161 --> 01:06:41,994
like shit like that.

2612
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,350
Like can you go to like really,

2613
01:06:43,351 --> 01:06:45,240
really ancient places like that?

2614
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:45,721
That's,

2615
01:06:45,721 --> 01:06:46,170
I mean,

2616
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:49,170
I know it's a different term
when you say like spiritual,

2617
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:53,610
but it's kind of like this gotta be
like a certain energy to those places.

2618
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:55,020
If you really believe in that,

2619
01:06:55,021 --> 01:06:58,410
if you really believe that human
energy stays in the area when the,

2620
01:06:58,411 --> 01:06:59,220
when the person is,

2621
01:06:59,220 --> 01:06:59,620
is,

2622
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:00,450
is killed,

2623
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:02,640
which people believe when they
believe that houses are haunted,

2624
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:03,060
you know,

2625
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,530
I know a lot of people that you tell them,

2626
01:07:04,531 --> 01:07:04,741
hey,

2627
01:07:04,741 --> 01:07:06,340
you want to buy Jon Benet Ramsey house?

2628
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:06,780
It's like,

2629
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:07,890
go get the fuck outta here.

2630
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:08,430
Like I'll do,

2631
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:09,270
it's the best house ever.

2632
01:07:09,271 --> 01:07:09,781
It's beautiful.

2633
01:07:09,781 --> 01:07:11,790
It's only like half
what it would be worth.

2634
01:07:11,791 --> 01:07:13,920
It wasn't Jon Benet Ramsey
still still still be like,

2635
01:07:13,921 --> 01:07:14,760
fuck that.

2636
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:16,140
I'm not living in that house.

2637
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:16,501
Why?

2638
01:07:16,501 --> 01:07:19,410
Because they think that there
might be some energy in that house.

2639
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:20,790
There's something leftover.

2640
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:21,931
Yeah.

2641
01:07:21,931 --> 01:07:22,131
They,

2642
01:07:22,131 --> 01:07:22,420
um,

2643
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:22,740
uh,

2644
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:26,820
and I think that's almost even a better
way of like describing what it is you

2645
01:07:26,821 --> 01:07:27,061
get.

2646
01:07:27,061 --> 01:07:30,360
Like you feel something when
you're in that presence,

2647
01:07:30,361 --> 01:07:31,500
like that type of greatness,

2648
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:34,650
which is that I think
you feel like a boost.

2649
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:35,311
You know what I mean?

2650
01:07:35,311 --> 01:07:35,450
Like,

2651
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:35,720
yeah.

2652
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,370
Like some feeling that you're,

2653
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:38,400
when you're there you can't,

2654
01:07:38,401 --> 01:07:38,620
you,

2655
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:41,310
you cannot unless you're
a total sociopath.

2656
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,650
Walk into Matsu Pete Machu
Picchu and just be like,

2657
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:44,040
yeah.

2658
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:44,280
Yeah.

2659
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:44,700
Cool.

2660
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:45,300
All right,

2661
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:45,780
well you guys went,

2662
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:47,310
you able to grab lunch like it's,

2663
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:50,160
it's too amazing to captivating,

2664
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:52,980
like inspiring to just be like seen it.

2665
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:53,580
It's,

2666
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:54,413
it's amazing.

2667
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:56,491
Yeah.

2668
01:07:56,491 --> 01:08:01,150
I would love to go to a place where I
knew there was like Roman battles just to

2669
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,370
walk on the ground.

2670
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:02,611
Yeah.

2671
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:03,660
Like where the coliseum is.

2672
01:08:03,661 --> 01:08:08,430
They let you on the ground there in the
coliseum they liked you actually walk

2673
01:08:08,431 --> 01:08:09,480
onto the holder in the middle.

2674
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:10,393
Yeah.

2675
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,860
You don't get to walk all throughout it.

2676
01:08:12,861 --> 01:08:15,500
They have like there's
areas that you can through.

2677
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:15,711
Yeah.

2678
01:08:15,711 --> 01:08:16,850
It's like a path through the whole thing.

2679
01:08:16,851 --> 01:08:17,290
If I,

2680
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:17,501
if I,

2681
01:08:17,501 --> 01:08:21,680
if I remember dude eat a pot Brownie and
stay in the middle of the coliseum and

2682
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:22,910
think of how crazy that shit is.

2683
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:27,380
Could you imagine if you were blitzkrieg
and one of those Joey Diaz Banana bread

2684
01:08:27,381 --> 01:08:31,130
specials that he gets from that Russian
place and you went to the fucking Roman

2685
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:32,450
Colosseum and you stood
there in the middle of that.

2686
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:34,123
That'd be awesome.

2687
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:34,910
Dude.

2688
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,080
Can I read you this about,

2689
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:37,340
I looked up this thing.

2690
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,233
Okay.

2691
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:38,601
In,

2692
01:08:38,601 --> 01:08:39,434
um,

2693
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:40,730
in 1531,

2694
01:08:40,731 --> 01:08:43,960
the Spanish expedition led
by a Fransisco be saddle.

2695
01:08:43,961 --> 01:08:44,220
The,

2696
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:48,500
the guy that just likes
discovered Peru in for Spain,

2697
01:08:48,530 --> 01:08:48,801
let's say.

2698
01:08:48,801 --> 01:08:49,170
Right.

2699
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:51,380
Right now that was the
Spanish guy that came over.

2700
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:54,710
He had 180 men and 37 horses.

2701
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,500
We're on a quest to
conquer the Incan Empire,

2702
01:08:58,550 --> 01:08:59,060
Hispanic,

2703
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:00,500
Spanish advanced to the south,

2704
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:01,873
um,

2705
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:03,740
after receiving reinforcements.

2706
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:04,820
Um,

2707
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:08,780
and then what they marched toward it
force a with a force of 106 foot soldiers

2708
01:09:08,781 --> 01:09:13,781
and 62 horsemen and they went
on to beat out the wallpaper,

2709
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:21,200
the Incan guy and I believe
his 80,000 man army.

2710
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:22,363
Whoa.

2711
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,233
Yeah.

2712
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:25,520
Cause they had guns and disease.

2713
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:26,750
Their disease killed

2714
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:30,830
a huge holy shit.

2715
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:35,180
So a couple hundred bad motherfuckers
from Spain just dominated that whole

2716
01:09:35,181 --> 01:09:35,660
place.

2717
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:36,440
Yup.

2718
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,800
And he captured a,

2719
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,940
he captured the top dog,

2720
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,880
the Spanish did it captured
at the Wada and they,

2721
01:09:43,881 --> 01:09:44,714
uh,

2722
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:45,621
they offered,

2723
01:09:45,621 --> 01:09:47,570
he offered to fill a large room.

2724
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,070
They tell you this like when you're there,

2725
01:09:49,071 --> 01:09:50,750
but 22 feet long,

2726
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:52,340
17 feet wide.

2727
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:57,200
And I hate height of eight feet with
gold and twice with silver within two

2728
01:09:57,201 --> 01:09:57,860
months.

2729
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,450
So to fill up rooms,

2730
01:09:59,810 --> 01:10:03,770
which is gold and silver and the Spanish,

2731
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:04,371
uh,

2732
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:05,720
agreed to the terms.

2733
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:07,130
Um,

2734
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:09,080
got the gold and silver
and then killed him.

2735
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:10,910
Oh Shit.

2736
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:11,570
Yeah.

2737
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:12,291
Gangster style.

2738
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,124
Right.

2739
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,510
God Damn.

2740
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,790
And I'm cute.

2741
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:20,540
Imagine if you were forced
to live like back then,

2742
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:25,670
can you imagine if you are on the fucking
shores of Peru or the ground in Peru

2743
01:10:25,671 --> 01:10:30,140
and you saw the Spaniards rolling over
the hill and horses and shit shooting at

2744
01:10:30,141 --> 01:10:30,870
you?

2745
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:31,160
Yeah.

2746
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:34,640
They just decided they were just
going to take over mother fucker.

2747
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,440
Could you imagine how
much that would suck?

2748
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:38,000
Yeah,

2749
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:38,480
they uh,

2750
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,170
uh,

2751
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:39,590
they were going,

2752
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:39,920
he was,

2753
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:40,760
they sentenced him,

2754
01:10:40,761 --> 01:10:41,331
they like did a,

2755
01:10:41,331 --> 01:10:42,021
like a formal,

2756
01:10:42,021 --> 01:10:43,370
like you're on trial,

2757
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:43,911
you're guilty,

2758
01:10:43,911 --> 01:10:44,810
we're going to kill you now.

2759
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:49,340
And then they sentenced him to
die by burning and then they,

2760
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,233
uh,

2761
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:55,750
they gave in accordance with his request
because he agreed to be baptized then

2762
01:10:56,241 --> 01:10:56,391
a,

2763
01:10:56,391 --> 01:10:57,500
they strangled them instead.

2764
01:10:57,890 --> 01:10:58,723
Oh my God.

2765
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:00,081
Wow.

2766
01:11:00,081 --> 01:11:03,020
He agreed to be baptized and then they
strangled him instead of burning them

2767
01:11:03,021 --> 01:11:03,490
alive.

2768
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:03,800
Yeah.

2769
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:04,790
That was the compromise.

2770
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:06,800
Holy Shit.

2771
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:10,730
They got one more compromise out
of them before they killed them.

2772
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:11,191
Crazy.

2773
01:11:11,191 --> 01:11:12,440
Made we get baptized.

2774
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:12,840
Yeah.

2775
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,100
Holy Shit.

2776
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:14,963
Yeah.

2777
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:16,350
Dude.

2778
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:19,290
People back then rocked it
in an entirely different way.

2779
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:20,693
You know,

2780
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:24,300
back then you really could be like a
Michelle Bachmann and control the world.

2781
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:25,930
Yeah.

2782
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:26,291
You know,

2783
01:11:26,291 --> 01:11:26,521
it was,

2784
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:31,380
there was no internet videos from 1999
with you talking about the apocalypse and

2785
01:11:31,381 --> 01:11:33,660
doom and absolutely man,

2786
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:35,250
the fucking,

2787
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:40,250
could you imagine if you could get
inside the head of any sort of a dictator

2788
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:43,110
from that time period?

2789
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:44,471
Any sort of,

2790
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:44,820
uh,

2791
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:46,050
a king or,

2792
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:46,651
you know,

2793
01:11:46,651 --> 01:11:47,040
just,

2794
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:47,880
just to get it,

2795
01:11:47,881 --> 01:11:48,270
it's like,

2796
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:52,890
see how they were running shit back
in like 1492 when Columbus took off.

2797
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:53,430
They were,

2798
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:54,240
you know,

2799
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:55,073
they were,

2800
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:55,560
they,

2801
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,510
people forget like Spain.

2802
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:58,020
That was,

2803
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:59,610
that was gangster country.

2804
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:00,540
Yeah,

2805
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:00,871
they have,

2806
01:12:00,871 --> 01:12:01,171
we have,

2807
01:12:01,171 --> 01:12:02,004
uh,

2808
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:06,990
there are however many people like gotta
be like close to 700 million or 800

2809
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:11,370
million people that speak a
language from like 3000 miles away.

2810
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:13,380
Cause they fucking ran shit man.

2811
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:15,230
They swung their dicks around.

2812
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:15,391
Hey,

2813
01:12:15,391 --> 01:12:16,380
there's a hundred of us,

2814
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:17,400
they're going to kill you.

2815
01:12:17,401 --> 01:12:18,234
80,000.

2816
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:18,691
Yeah.

2817
01:12:18,691 --> 01:12:20,310
All gangster shit now.

2818
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:21,211
Yeah.

2819
01:12:21,211 --> 01:12:24,780
And it's like if they were a
hundred dudes without a country,

2820
01:12:24,781 --> 01:12:25,980
they would just be pirates.

2821
01:12:26,190 --> 01:12:26,410
Yeah.

2822
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:27,540
No one would take them seriously.

2823
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:29,940
They'd be a band of pirates
and Ruffins but instead,

2824
01:12:29,941 --> 01:12:31,770
history actually looks upon it as,

2825
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:32,520
you know,

2826
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,620
almost like a qualified act.

2827
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:35,191
Like,

2828
01:12:35,191 --> 01:12:35,431
well,

2829
01:12:35,431 --> 01:12:35,701
you know,

2830
01:12:35,701 --> 01:12:37,500
they were Spain attacked this,

2831
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:37,980
you know,

2832
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:38,521
instead of,

2833
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:38,761
you know,

2834
01:12:38,761 --> 01:12:39,180
like,

2835
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:39,660
you know,

2836
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:43,830
black beard and his gang of thugs
tried to take over at North Carolina,

2837
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:44,550
you know,

2838
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:45,331
instead of that,

2839
01:12:45,331 --> 01:12:45,920
it's,

2840
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,280
it's not the whole country.

2841
01:12:47,281 --> 01:12:50,370
So it's qualified as thuggish
when it's super thuggish,

2842
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:51,700
it's totally thuggish.

2843
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,430
It's the most gangster shit ever.

2844
01:12:53,431 --> 01:12:55,800
100 dudes take over the
fucking whole country.

2845
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:56,940
Unbelievable man.

2846
01:12:56,941 --> 01:12:57,240
Shit.

2847
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,080
That's insane,

2848
01:12:58,081 --> 01:12:58,560
man.

2849
01:12:58,560 --> 01:12:59,580
That's hard to believe.

2850
01:12:59,581 --> 01:13:02,750
They have rapid fire guns
back then or was it a muscle?

2851
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:03,190
No,

2852
01:13:03,190 --> 01:13:03,390
no,

2853
01:13:03,390 --> 01:13:04,280
they did it with Moscow.

2854
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,890
He took over with muskets.

2855
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:11,100
How stressful that would be like somebody
who's like running right towards you

2856
01:13:11,101 --> 01:13:12,950
and you're just trying to
fucking fill your muscles.

2857
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:15,930
It's also the case though
that when the Spaniards came,

2858
01:13:15,931 --> 01:13:17,010
there was a lot of confusion.

2859
01:13:17,011 --> 01:13:20,040
They thought the Spaniards were
gods and so they'll let them in.

2860
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:20,401
Yeah.

2861
01:13:20,401 --> 01:13:21,860
I think the Spanish took off,

2862
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,520
took over and started killing people.

2863
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:24,510
I think of Cortez,

2864
01:13:24,511 --> 01:13:24,691
right?

2865
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:25,620
It might be Cortez.

2866
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:26,693
Is that Cortez?

2867
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:27,563
My fucking,

2868
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:31,020
my mind history is completely limited.

2869
01:13:31,021 --> 01:13:32,040
My Aztec history,

2870
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,480
all I know is the cool shit.

2871
01:13:33,481 --> 01:13:37,140
Like can't Kukula [inaudible] was the
snake with the fucking feathers bro.

2872
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,610
Like I know shit like that.

2873
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,160
Well that's all Quadel.

2874
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:43,770
I know they had a lot of them hadn't seen
horses so they thought they were like,

2875
01:13:43,771 --> 01:13:44,790
I saw horses and they were like,

2876
01:13:44,791 --> 01:13:45,500
what the fuck?

2877
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:49,440
That's why didn't they think that the
Spaniards on horses were initially gods?

2878
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:49,801
Yeah,

2879
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:51,390
I think they thought
they were one being too,

2880
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:52,770
cause they came off and they're like,

2881
01:13:52,771 --> 01:13:54,030
that thing has got four legs.

2882
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:54,241
Yeah.

2883
01:13:54,241 --> 01:13:54,960
I think there was,

2884
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,520
there was a lot of,

2885
01:13:56,521 --> 01:14:00,270
a lot of confusion in the beginning and
they actually gave them a lot of money

2886
01:14:00,271 --> 01:14:03,840
and like let them deep in and
then they eventually realized,

2887
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:04,800
but if it was too late,

2888
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:05,611
the demonic gods,

2889
01:14:05,611 --> 01:14:07,530
they were just men that rode
around and fucking horses.

2890
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:08,820
Unbelievable man.

2891
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,950
That's how bad people had it back then.

2892
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:11,860
Yeah.

2893
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:13,720
Tenzing that does not that long ago.

2894
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:15,280
And they would do shit
like tell them like,

2895
01:14:15,281 --> 01:14:16,960
your whole worship shit is bullshit.

2896
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:17,380
Yeah.

2897
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:18,250
It's Catholic.

2898
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,630
Like you're Catholic or
you're dead and the car.

2899
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:21,280
All right.

2900
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:25,060
Whatever the thing they'd done for
like all the only thing they knew,

2901
01:14:25,061 --> 01:14:25,631
which was probably,

2902
01:14:25,631 --> 01:14:25,870
you know,

2903
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:27,640
son or are like stars.

2904
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:28,751
These guys were like,

2905
01:14:28,751 --> 01:14:29,250
that's not what,

2906
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:30,910
it's Hawaii too,

2907
01:14:30,911 --> 01:14:31,350
man.

2908
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:31,600
Yeah.

2909
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:31,801
No.

2910
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:35,890
So I said that with the correct
terminology or what's the word?

2911
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:36,531
An NCAA.

2912
01:14:36,531 --> 01:14:37,540
[inaudible] Hawaii.

2913
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:38,210
Um,

2914
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:38,510
they,

2915
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:40,600
they had a mercenaries are missionaries,

2916
01:14:40,690 --> 01:14:41,523
same thing.

2917
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,071
Missionaries.

2918
01:14:42,071 --> 01:14:43,150
They're mercenaries for God.

2919
01:14:43,151 --> 01:14:43,984
That's all it is.

2920
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:47,740
Mercenaries came to Hawaii in the
18 hundreds and converted them into

2921
01:14:47,741 --> 01:14:48,574
Christianity.

2922
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:49,240
And uh,

2923
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:50,170
like in the 18 hundreds,

2924
01:14:50,171 --> 01:14:51,820
they had their first Christian King,

2925
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:52,803
you know?

2926
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:53,823
Yeah.

2927
01:14:54,210 --> 01:14:54,820
And they're like,

2928
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:55,440
mmm.

2929
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:55,890
Yeah.

2930
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:56,240
Hawaii.

2931
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:57,640
Hawaii's a crazy situation,

2932
01:14:57,641 --> 01:14:57,910
man.

2933
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,680
Did you swim with dolphins
when you're there last?

2934
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:00,400
No,

2935
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,390
there was no dolphins.

2936
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:02,590
I didn't see any dolphins,

2937
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:05,860
but I did it a few times ago.

2938
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:06,311
Not,

2939
01:15:06,311 --> 01:15:06,911
not this time,

2940
01:15:06,911 --> 01:15:08,560
but the last time in alumni.

2941
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:10,810
So another one of the
islands and they're there.

2942
01:15:10,811 --> 01:15:11,980
You can swim with the dolphins.

2943
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:13,000
The,

2944
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:13,720
the most,

2945
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:16,060
the triplets experience that I ever
had was in a boat with the dolphins.

2946
01:15:16,061 --> 01:15:18,880
Dolphins will follow the boats and the
play with you and jump around next to

2947
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:19,150
you.

2948
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:19,750
Yeah.

2949
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:23,560
It's amazing that that's
five hours away by plane,

2950
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:24,850
yet it's America.

2951
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:25,860
Yeah.

2952
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:26,041
Yeah.

2953
01:15:26,041 --> 01:15:28,120
And if we can't wrap our
head around how big that is,

2954
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:29,440
that's literally,

2955
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:34,470
if you took off from Burbank and
the whole country was the ocean,

2956
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:36,250
the whole country,

2957
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,930
every state along the way.

2958
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:39,220
You look at Ohio,

2959
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:40,360
it's all ocean.

2960
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,280
And then you land in New
Jersey and as the shore,

2961
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:44,550
that's how fucking far away Hawaii,

2962
01:15:44,570 --> 01:15:48,250
Hawaii is over the ocean and yet
it's still considered America.

2963
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:51,480
That really is,

2964
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,001
you forget that.

2965
01:15:52,001 --> 01:15:52,970
That's colonization,

2966
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:53,201
right?

2967
01:15:53,201 --> 01:15:53,860
That's what that is.

2968
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:55,760
That's gangster shit is what that is.

2969
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,240
Old School gangster shit.

2970
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:02,350
He'll Hawaii was taken over
and the 1890s by businessmen.

2971
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:03,340
Yeah.

2972
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:04,960
At least that's what it said
when I was reading there.

2973
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:05,860
That thing,

2974
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:09,160
there just were some fucking people
trying to keep on keeping on out there in

2975
01:16:09,161 --> 01:16:10,990
the middle of the ocean,

2976
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:12,280
living on a volcano.

2977
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:14,410
You know Spain,

2978
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:17,750
Spain's still has the Canary Islands
that's off the west coast to Africa and

2979
01:16:17,751 --> 01:16:17,951
they're like,

2980
01:16:17,951 --> 01:16:18,570
that's how I should,

2981
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:22,480
we're lucky that Hawaii is five hours
away in a plane because that is the best

2982
01:16:22,481 --> 01:16:23,650
spot ever.

2983
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:24,640
If that,

2984
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:28,000
if that was like you could drive there
and people would ruin that in a week

2985
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:29,420
cause you could drive it to Hawaii.

2986
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:30,580
They made a bridge to Hawaii.

2987
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:35,700
It would be backed up with cars every
day forever and Hawaii be covered in dirt

2988
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:36,100
and,

2989
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:36,490
and,

2990
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:39,160
and fucking plastic bags
and cigarette butts.

2991
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:41,170
It'd be jacked within no time.

2992
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:41,621
Yeah.

2993
01:16:41,621 --> 01:16:42,640
It's so beautiful.

2994
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:42,941
Yeah.

2995
01:16:42,941 --> 01:16:45,040
It's a fact that you
have to fly over there.

2996
01:16:45,041 --> 01:16:46,990
She can't bring too much shit with you.

2997
01:16:46,991 --> 01:16:49,300
You can't keep your shit
there unless you live there.

2998
01:16:49,301 --> 01:16:49,961
And if you live there,

2999
01:16:49,961 --> 01:16:52,780
they give you a shit if you're a
fucking litter bug Yukon living on,

3000
01:16:52,781 --> 01:16:53,260
yeah,

3001
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:54,580
like you walk along the beach,

3002
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:56,620
the beaches are clean man there,

3003
01:16:56,621 --> 01:16:58,810
there've actually fucking
clean like the sea,

3004
01:16:58,811 --> 01:17:00,370
very little trash on the beach.

3005
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:02,470
And if that was the same
beach and the east coast,

3006
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:03,970
it would just be everywhere you looked.

3007
01:17:03,971 --> 01:17:08,810
It'd be a can or a bottle or a
fucking a tampon or a syringe.

3008
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,070
Like every where you go this

3009
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:10,903
trash,

3010
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:12,440
they can't clean it up enough.

3011
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:14,870
And then it's in the water
as well because you know,

3012
01:17:14,871 --> 01:17:17,780
the water's coming from all the way the
fuck up to Maine and everything along

3013
01:17:17,781 --> 01:17:18,501
down the way.

3014
01:17:18,501 --> 01:17:19,940
All down the east coast.

3015
01:17:19,941 --> 01:17:23,060
It's all just fucking of
cities and shit and people,

3016
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:23,930
you know,

3017
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:24,471
empty in there,

3018
01:17:24,471 --> 01:17:26,030
fucking toilet into the water.

3019
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:28,310
So by the time it gets to where you are,

3020
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:28,640
it's,

3021
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:29,150
it's,

3022
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:29,451
you know,

3023
01:17:29,451 --> 01:17:30,230
it's disgusting.

3024
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:31,990
Half of them are
disgusting and comparison.

3025
01:17:32,010 --> 01:17:33,980
Hawaii just pristine man.

3026
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:34,963
Beautiful.

3027
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:36,290
Couldn't deal with living there though.

3028
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:36,800
No.

3029
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,011
Yeah,

3030
01:17:37,011 --> 01:17:37,551
I was thinking there.

3031
01:17:37,551 --> 01:17:38,450
I went to a Luau.

3032
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:40,520
It's pretty bad ass covering
up more interesting.

3033
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:40,731
Sure.

3034
01:17:40,731 --> 01:17:42,380
Row is that Lou Ella is like a party,

3035
01:17:42,381 --> 01:17:42,680
right?

3036
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:42,891
Yeah.

3037
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:43,581
It's like a party.

3038
01:17:43,581 --> 01:17:45,110
They cook a pig under the ground.

3039
01:17:45,111 --> 01:17:46,220
The pig was delicious.

3040
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:47,181
And uh,

3041
01:17:47,181 --> 01:17:50,350
the dude who was one of the
Hawaiian dance or dudes was a,

3042
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:51,080
uh,

3043
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:51,440
uh,

3044
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:52,273
MMA fan.

3045
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:55,880
He's hooked me up and he gave me a piece
of the cheek that's supposed to be the

3046
01:17:55,881 --> 01:17:57,050
best part of the pig.

3047
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,370
The butt cheek or the face cheek.

3048
01:17:58,371 --> 01:17:59,090
The face cheek.

3049
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:00,080
Not the butt cheek doing,

3050
01:18:00,081 --> 01:18:00,800
how dare you.

3051
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:00,931
Well,

3052
01:18:00,931 --> 01:18:01,850
you do eat the skin.

3053
01:18:01,851 --> 01:18:02,980
They give you a crispy skin.

3054
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:03,873
They cook the scans.

3055
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:05,030
It's really good.

3056
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:05,893
It's good.

3057
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:06,913
Yeah.

3058
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:07,221
Slow,

3059
01:18:07,221 --> 01:18:07,821
slow cook,

3060
01:18:07,821 --> 01:18:08,630
pig,

3061
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:09,441
slow cook pig.

3062
01:18:09,441 --> 01:18:10,730
It's pretty fucking spectacular.

3063
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:11,671
It's a,

3064
01:18:11,671 --> 01:18:12,680
it's amazing stuff.

3065
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:13,370
Hmm.

3066
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:13,890
Um,

3067
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:14,300
um,

3068
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:16,850
but their music is whack.

3069
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:18,410
You have to sit through their music,

3070
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:19,251
you know,

3071
01:18:19,251 --> 01:18:19,570
and all,

3072
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:19,890
all,

3073
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:20,890
all I was thinking was,

3074
01:18:20,891 --> 01:18:23,010
I mean it's a beautiful culture there.

3075
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:24,530
They're amazing people.

3076
01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:25,701
Especially,

3077
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:26,201
let's be honest,

3078
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:29,060
especially when you're going to a resort
and you're spending money where they

3079
01:18:29,061 --> 01:18:29,960
have to be nice to you.

3080
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:30,883
You know what I'm saying?

3081
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:32,240
But even outside of that,

3082
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:33,074
like in Maui,

3083
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:34,310
people are very nice.

3084
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:35,091
They're just friendly.

3085
01:18:35,091 --> 01:18:35,590
If you're not,

3086
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:35,900
like,

3087
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:37,610
whenever I hear people say things like,

3088
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:38,460
Oh Hawaii,

3089
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:39,710
I just don't like white people.

3090
01:18:39,711 --> 01:18:40,300
They don't like people.

3091
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:40,460
Well,

3092
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:41,360
why not?

3093
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:44,020
Is it because so many
white people are cunts?

3094
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:44,570
Yeah.

3095
01:18:44,570 --> 01:18:45,860
Is that possibly what it is?

3096
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:49,100
My experience there is that they've
always been super nice there.

3097
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:50,720
They're just really genuinely nice people.

3098
01:18:50,721 --> 01:18:53,540
But so many people are Douche
bags and you're a Douche bag.

3099
01:18:53,541 --> 01:18:57,290
You coming from another country basically
to them and you're littering and

3100
01:18:57,291 --> 01:18:58,480
you're acting like an asshole.

3101
01:18:58,490 --> 01:18:59,930
And of course they're going
to want to kick your ass.

3102
01:18:59,931 --> 01:19:00,350
Of course.

3103
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:00,591
You know?

3104
01:19:00,591 --> 01:19:02,510
So there's this certain
amount of Douche bags,

3105
01:19:02,511 --> 01:19:03,680
I'm sure that live in Hawaii,

3106
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:05,240
but for the most part it's,

3107
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:06,500
it's a really nice,

3108
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:09,110
but that music bro,

3109
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,540
that Lou AllMusic goal,

3110
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:15,880
there was a song that they sang about
a woman selling papayas and a red and

3111
01:19:17,871 --> 01:19:22,871
green bananas and that was the whole
fucking song she's sending her Papaya has

3112
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,990
and then green when uh,

3113
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:29,570
uh,

3114
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:32,480
and that's the song and
I'm going fucking crazy.

3115
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:35,030
I'm going crazy because I just
got there from the gym too.

3116
01:19:35,031 --> 01:19:35,541
I worked out,

3117
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:36,770
they have a nice gym there at the hotel,

3118
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:41,210
so I kinda know full fucking four
days of power training their son.

3119
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:43,430
I worked out hard there so it felt good,

3120
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:45,110
which kept me together.

3121
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,310
But the whole time I was a,

3122
01:19:46,311 --> 01:19:46,791
in the gym,

3123
01:19:46,791 --> 01:19:48,050
I was listening to some old school,

3124
01:19:48,051 --> 01:19:48,884
Leonard Skinner,

3125
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:50,870
I got like really into
Leonard Skinner this week.

3126
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:51,740
Yeah,

3127
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:54,080
they got some fucking jams do heroin shit.

3128
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:55,040
Oh God.

3129
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:55,610
It was just,

3130
01:19:55,610 --> 01:19:59,690
I just got into the whole idea of
these dirty white guys from Florida,

3131
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:00,141
you know,

3132
01:20:00,141 --> 01:20:02,090
drinking and sing in and it's just,

3133
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,660
it's a fucking good vibe.

3134
01:20:03,661 --> 01:20:05,870
Some of their songs are fucking great man,

3135
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:07,770
free birds kind of a song

3136
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,540
and there's parts that are not that fun,

3137
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:13,650
but when they go and they just start
getting low that I can't change

3138
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:18,680
free

3139
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:19,670
bird.

3140
01:20:19,670 --> 01:20:20,750
Hey Pam,

3141
01:20:20,751 --> 01:20:21,051
Pam,

3142
01:20:21,051 --> 01:20:21,450
Pam,

3143
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:21,691
dude.

3144
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:23,580
When you left in and that
fucking shit comes on,

3145
01:20:23,581 --> 01:20:24,414
you're like,

3146
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:27,900
you just want to fucking
fire up some extra sets.

3147
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:33,340
So I heard that I had just heard Freebird
I had just heard they know the ballot

3148
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:34,380
of is low.

3149
01:20:34,381 --> 01:20:35,220
I just heard,

3150
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:36,293
you know,

3151
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:38,700
I just heard all the cool shit.

3152
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:39,930
They call me the breeze.

3153
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:43,500
It's like beer-drinking guys that like
fucking rock and roll and I'm sitting

3154
01:20:43,501 --> 01:20:44,640
there and I pop up restroom.

3155
01:20:44,641 --> 01:20:46,620
Of course I want a full Hawaii experience.

3156
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,690
I'm sitting here at this Luau,

3157
01:20:48,870 --> 01:20:49,710
beg to the Gills,

3158
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:51,980
trying to keep an eye
on the kids drinking,

3159
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:53,130
drinking,

3160
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:53,521
drinking,

3161
01:20:53,521 --> 01:20:54,271
Pina Coladas,

3162
01:20:54,271 --> 01:20:56,100
listening to some whack ass music.

3163
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:56,730
And I'm like,

3164
01:20:56,730 --> 01:20:57,600
and while I'm sitting there,

3165
01:20:57,601 --> 01:20:59,410
I'm having a great ass time in Hawaii.

3166
01:20:59,411 --> 01:20:59,701
The weather,

3167
01:20:59,701 --> 01:21:00,241
it's beautiful,

3168
01:21:00,241 --> 01:21:01,410
it's paradise.

3169
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:02,160
I'm thinking,

3170
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:02,671
God damn,

3171
01:21:02,671 --> 01:21:04,350
how awesome would it be if they just said,

3172
01:21:04,351 --> 01:21:04,921
ladies and gentleman,

3173
01:21:04,921 --> 01:21:05,910
please welcome letter together.

3174
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:12,180
And the Hawaiian guys step
aside and somehow another
body van sat is still alive

3175
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:13,590
and they fucking start jamming.

3176
01:21:13,591 --> 01:21:15,210
Leonard scattered out there on the beach.

3177
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:18,330
I would pay $100,000 for that shit.

3178
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:18,961
All right.

3179
01:21:18,961 --> 01:21:19,531
You know what I'm saying?

3180
01:21:19,531 --> 01:21:22,740
I mean fucking then it would
be an amazing vacation.

3181
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:23,210
Yeah,

3182
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:25,320
you're making me listening
to a couple of C's

3183
01:21:27,890 --> 01:21:30,210
and her and been greeting,

3184
01:21:30,211 --> 01:21:33,060
but none other other cultures.

3185
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:35,820
I don't know why some music is so,

3186
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:36,571
so bad,

3187
01:21:36,571 --> 01:21:37,420
like vicious,

3188
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,570
brutal lot of like you go to like,

3189
01:21:39,571 --> 01:21:39,950
you know,

3190
01:21:39,950 --> 01:21:44,550
you look at research like eastern European
countries and they're fucking music.

3191
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:46,140
Jazz music is like,

3192
01:21:46,141 --> 01:21:46,974
what the fuck?

3193
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:48,150
Yeah,

3194
01:21:48,150 --> 01:21:51,040
it totally is Borat shit and so good.

3195
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:53,120
And they all are really
like that and like,

3196
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:55,950
and it's some guy with some
creepy fucking mustache.

3197
01:21:55,951 --> 01:21:56,320
He was like,

3198
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:00,540
no and none of it really sounds
like it has a melody or rhythm and,

3199
01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:01,530
and they're going crazy.

3200
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:02,790
Like that's the best song ever.

3201
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:06,240
That's the song that the goat doesn't
drink out of the founder cause that's

3202
01:22:06,241 --> 01:22:06,811
where you live.

3203
01:22:06,811 --> 01:22:07,261
And you're like,

3204
01:22:07,261 --> 01:22:07,590
what the,

3205
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:08,423
what is it the,

3206
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:09,480
what's up?

3207
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:10,590
What's up with Mexican music?

3208
01:22:10,591 --> 01:22:11,251
Same kind of thing,

3209
01:22:11,251 --> 01:22:11,521
right?

3210
01:22:11,521 --> 01:22:14,670
Like every single song sounds like an
ice cream truck going down the street.

3211
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:16,220
I mean it's like there is a,

3212
01:22:16,221 --> 01:22:17,190
there's a type of,

3213
01:22:17,191 --> 01:22:17,431
uh,

3214
01:22:17,431 --> 01:22:17,701
the,

3215
01:22:17,701 --> 01:22:19,260
the Mariachi music,

3216
01:22:19,290 --> 01:22:19,950
you know,

3217
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:23,280
the good Mariachi music
with good trumpets.

3218
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:27,630
Like when you hear like Oscar
de la Hoya stepping into the,

3219
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:28,473
into the ring,

3220
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,030
when he's walking down the aisle,

3221
01:22:30,031 --> 01:22:30,864
step into the ring,

3222
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:34,400
he brings with him a
bad ass Mariachi bands.

3223
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:36,750
These mother fuckers are on top of shit

3224
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:41,460
and they're doing that shit.

3225
01:22:41,461 --> 01:22:41,760
Man.

3226
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,500
These guys are bad ass to watch.

3227
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:43,950
Like they're,

3228
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:44,310
they're,

3229
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:45,180
they're experts.

3230
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,010
They're doing the real shit.

3231
01:22:47,011 --> 01:22:47,820
You know,

3232
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:50,390
there's some bullshit down
there because wack ass Mariachi,

3233
01:22:50,391 --> 01:22:51,970
you realize some white cast stand up.

3234
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:54,220
What a big culture is in Mexico,

3235
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:54,950
uh,

3236
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:55,621
that cowboys.

3237
01:22:55,621 --> 01:22:55,951
I right,

3238
01:22:55,951 --> 01:22:56,320
like,

3239
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:56,610
you know,

3240
01:22:56,610 --> 01:22:57,081
cowboy.

3241
01:22:57,081 --> 01:22:57,420
We were,

3242
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:58,530
and we have a country music,

3243
01:22:58,770 --> 01:22:59,491
a lot of that shit.

3244
01:22:59,491 --> 01:23:01,080
You're hearing that you're like,

3245
01:23:01,081 --> 01:23:01,914
what is that?

3246
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,270
That's their country music.

3247
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:03,480
Right.

3248
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:04,980
That's why you're like this fucking shit.

3249
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:05,963
Terrible man.

3250
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,570
They do have regular music.

3251
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,240
Only music I've ever heard.

3252
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:16,390
I was listening to a rap station that
was in Mexico and there was also one

3253
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:21,040
station that we went on where we were
allowed to swear because their station,

3254
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:26,070
their tower was actually located in Mexico
and even though we were in San Diego,

3255
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:30,040
they were a Mexican station and so
we were allowed to swear on the air.

3256
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:30,671
It was like,

3257
01:23:30,671 --> 01:23:32,050
that is fucking crazy.

3258
01:23:32,051 --> 01:23:32,291
He goes,

3259
01:23:32,291 --> 01:23:33,310
don't do it too much,

3260
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:34,660
but you can swear a little.

3261
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:34,990
Right.

3262
01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:35,410
Really?

3263
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:36,580
Yeah.

3264
01:23:36,610 --> 01:23:37,330
That is cool.

3265
01:23:37,330 --> 01:23:38,040
It was weird.

3266
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:38,330
Yeah,

3267
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:38,741
it's cool,

3268
01:23:38,741 --> 01:23:41,200
but look at this fucking
thing we're doing right now.

3269
01:23:41,201 --> 01:23:42,460
We don't have to worry
about any of that bullshit.

3270
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:47,170
We want to say fucking
radio seems so obsolete now,

3271
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:48,930
and I do radio and I love doing it.

3272
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:49,571
Don't get me wrong.

3273
01:23:49,571 --> 01:23:49,841
I mean it's,

3274
01:23:49,841 --> 01:23:53,470
it's always nice and Kevin and being are
my favorite as far as people that are

3275
01:23:53,471 --> 01:23:54,490
like still on radio.

3276
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:57,160
They're like my favorite show to come
in because it's in another way and I can

3277
01:23:57,161 --> 01:23:57,731
do it all the time,

3278
01:23:57,731 --> 01:23:58,360
but God,

3279
01:23:58,360 --> 01:23:59,830
I always have to watch what I'm saying.

3280
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,500
I always have to wonder if I
could say this or say that.

3281
01:24:02,501 --> 01:24:02,681
Like,

3282
01:24:02,681 --> 01:24:02,771
I,

3283
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:03,161
you know,

3284
01:24:03,161 --> 01:24:04,000
you gotta be careful.

3285
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:04,810
Yeah.

3286
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:07,090
I've had some really bad
radio experiences lately.

3287
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:09,460
Really just like shit where you're like,

3288
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:09,821
man,

3289
01:24:09,821 --> 01:24:10,720
can you fucking,

3290
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:13,840
can you do a little bit
like to add to this?

3291
01:24:13,841 --> 01:24:14,021
Like,

3292
01:24:14,021 --> 01:24:14,740
what do you mean?

3293
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:15,850
Like they'll go,

3294
01:24:15,851 --> 01:24:17,290
I've had one where like,

3295
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:18,250
I get there and they're like,

3296
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:19,360
just the green rooms over there.

3297
01:24:19,361 --> 01:24:20,194
We'll come get you.

3298
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:20,591
And you're like,

3299
01:24:20,591 --> 01:24:20,950
all right,

3300
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:22,150
you just sit down and get the green room.

3301
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:23,710
And then the guy comes and he's like,

3302
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:24,551
Hey,

3303
01:24:24,551 --> 01:24:25,230
so,

3304
01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:25,481
uh,

3305
01:24:25,481 --> 01:24:25,990
how you doing?

3306
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:26,560
Um,

3307
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,700
you'll be on the next segment.

3308
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:28,090
Like,

3309
01:24:28,090 --> 01:24:29,320
we don't really do interviews or anything.

3310
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:29,800
It's like,

3311
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:30,090
just,

3312
01:24:30,090 --> 01:24:30,310
you know,

3313
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:31,143
be funny.

3314
01:24:31,210 --> 01:24:31,631
And I'd be like,

3315
01:24:31,631 --> 01:24:32,260
what?

3316
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:32,830
And they're like,

3317
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:33,371
it's all on you,

3318
01:24:33,371 --> 01:24:33,670
man.

3319
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:34,900
Just be funny and I'm like,

3320
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:36,250
just be funny.

3321
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,140
Like we're just going to read.

3322
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:40,150
What do you mean you want
to start doing jokes?

3323
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:40,840
They're like,

3324
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,880
just your chance to do
whatever you want to do.

3325
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:43,211
I'm like,

3326
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:43,301
well,

3327
01:24:43,301 --> 01:24:44,380
can we just like talk?

3328
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,240
Do you want us to ask you
something specifically?

3329
01:24:46,241 --> 01:24:46,481
I'm like,

3330
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:46,571
well,

3331
01:24:46,571 --> 01:24:49,030
can we can't like have like a regular,

3332
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:52,480
like you don't want to like just
make it an organic conversation.

3333
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:52,771
Yeah.

3334
01:24:52,771 --> 01:24:53,590
Like can we just do that?

3335
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:54,580
We don't really do that here.

3336
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:55,440
Yeah.

3337
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:55,720
You know,

3338
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:56,230
they tried.

3339
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:58,660
Mami did not too down
in the Bob and Tom show.

3340
01:24:58,990 --> 01:24:59,711
Some guy came in,

3341
01:24:59,711 --> 01:25:01,910
Bob and Tom were cool as fuck those guys.

3342
01:25:01,970 --> 01:25:03,010
They were very cool guys.

3343
01:25:03,011 --> 01:25:03,280
Yeah.

3344
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,930
Once I actually got in to meet them,

3345
01:25:04,931 --> 01:25:06,130
but before I got to meet them,

3346
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:07,660
there was some dude that was like,

3347
01:25:07,661 --> 01:25:08,800
give me the stink eye.

3348
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:09,611
And he goes,

3349
01:25:09,611 --> 01:25:09,851
well,

3350
01:25:09,851 --> 01:25:11,850
what specifically do you want
them to talk to you about?

3351
01:25:12,130 --> 01:25:13,720
And I go Eggo due to anything.

3352
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:14,681
I go,

3353
01:25:14,681 --> 01:25:15,341
I'm low maintenance.

3354
01:25:15,341 --> 01:25:16,270
Just let's just talk.

3355
01:25:16,271 --> 01:25:17,104
Let's have a good time.

3356
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:17,681
Well they would,

3357
01:25:17,681 --> 01:25:19,030
they need things to lead you into,

3358
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:19,351
I call it,

3359
01:25:19,351 --> 01:25:19,571
dude,

3360
01:25:19,571 --> 01:25:20,404
I can't do that.

3361
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:20,891
I'm not,

3362
01:25:20,891 --> 01:25:21,000
yeah.

3363
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,230
I'm not going to tell you that I'm going
to talk about this or I'm going to talk

3364
01:25:23,231 --> 01:25:23,561
about that.

3365
01:25:23,561 --> 01:25:23,861
It's going to,

3366
01:25:23,861 --> 01:25:24,790
that's going to sound gross.

3367
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:25,390
No,

3368
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:26,141
let's just sit down.

3369
01:25:26,141 --> 01:25:26,980
We're going to have some fun.

3370
01:25:27,010 --> 01:25:27,843
Don't worry about it.

3371
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:31,360
And he came to the stink eye
like I was unprofessional.

3372
01:25:31,361 --> 01:25:33,800
Do you know that this
is the Bob and Tom Show?

3373
01:25:33,810 --> 01:25:36,070
Billy and Bob and Tom show
is a fucking huge show.

3374
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:36,341
Yeah,

3375
01:25:36,341 --> 01:25:36,810
it's huge.

3376
01:25:36,810 --> 01:25:37,000
Yeah.

3377
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:37,181
It's,

3378
01:25:37,181 --> 01:25:37,510
you know,

3379
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:38,890
syndicated all across the country.

3380
01:25:38,891 --> 01:25:40,500
They probably have millions of listeners.

3381
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,620
They got a lot of fucking listeners.

3382
01:25:41,621 --> 01:25:42,010
They help.

3383
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:43,270
They help a lot of comedians.

3384
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:44,104
Totally there.

3385
01:25:44,230 --> 01:25:47,530
I've been done that show a number
of times and they're always awesome.

3386
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,120
They're great guys.

3387
01:25:49,121 --> 01:25:50,350
Dude was giving me the stink eye,

3388
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:51,791
but you know,

3389
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:54,130
in his defense it's probably
what he's supposed to do,

3390
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:54,761
you know,

3391
01:25:54,761 --> 01:25:56,530
that's his fucking job and I'm ruining it.

3392
01:25:56,531 --> 01:25:56,771
You know,

3393
01:25:56,771 --> 01:25:57,790
like I'm some hot shots.

3394
01:25:57,791 --> 01:25:59,800
It's going to come in here
and I had to slink Dick.

3395
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,010
I had another one who,

3396
01:26:01,011 --> 01:26:01,111
uh,

3397
01:26:01,111 --> 01:26:02,400
I did call in and the,

3398
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:03,290
the guy's like,

3399
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:04,760
obviously you're going to be on a minute.

3400
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:05,541
Just like,

3401
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:05,721
you know,

3402
01:26:05,721 --> 01:26:06,170
you got it.

3403
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:07,670
You got a couple of jokes ready to go.

3404
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:08,623
I was like,

3405
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:09,673
I guess,

3406
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:10,461
and then he's like,

3407
01:26:10,461 --> 01:26:10,821
all right.

3408
01:26:10,821 --> 01:26:11,900
So then they pushed me on.

3409
01:26:11,901 --> 01:26:12,351
The guy's like,

3410
01:26:12,351 --> 01:26:12,621
hey,

3411
01:26:12,621 --> 01:26:13,610
you're going to be at the club.

3412
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:14,420
It's awesome.

3413
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:15,320
Everybody go see him.

3414
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:15,891
All right man.

3415
01:26:15,891 --> 01:26:16,940
Now before you do your thing,

3416
01:26:16,941 --> 01:26:18,020
we're gonna have you do
your thing right here.

3417
01:26:18,021 --> 01:26:18,500
And I'm like,

3418
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:19,333
Nah,

3419
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:20,270
I'm just going to start going.

3420
01:26:20,271 --> 01:26:21,170
Oh my God,

3421
01:26:21,171 --> 01:26:21,981
that's so gross.

3422
01:26:21,981 --> 01:26:23,810
And then we just talk
from it and he's like,

3423
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:26,620
just go right into Ralphie May's act.

3424
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:28,550
I'll just go right into Ralph.

3425
01:26:28,610 --> 01:26:28,761
He's,

3426
01:26:28,761 --> 01:26:30,260
I can tell him that he did it to say,

3427
01:26:30,261 --> 01:26:30,591
Ralphie,

3428
01:26:30,591 --> 01:26:30,831
man,

3429
01:26:30,831 --> 01:26:31,130
I just,

3430
01:26:31,130 --> 01:26:32,230
I just wasn't ready to do your act.

3431
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:34,640
I just shorten that on you
don't even do it yourself.

3432
01:26:34,641 --> 01:26:35,750
Make it an inside joke.

3433
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:36,170
Yeah.

3434
01:26:36,170 --> 01:26:37,580
I should write somebody else's material,

3435
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:39,313
Tom.

3436
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:39,951
Yeah.

3437
01:26:39,951 --> 01:26:40,820
Do on purpose.

3438
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:42,680
Like tell like having an
agreement with someone.

3439
01:26:42,681 --> 01:26:46,580
Listen if I'm ever in a bad situation
and they want me to do my own material,

3440
01:26:46,581 --> 01:26:47,420
I'm going to do it very badly,

3441
01:26:47,421 --> 01:26:48,320
but I'm gonna do your stuff.

3442
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:48,770
Do it.

3443
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:48,980
Yeah.

3444
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:49,610
Okay.

3445
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:50,360
And you make a deal.

3446
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:50,920
Yeah.

3447
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:51,610
Yeah.

3448
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:53,630
Cause otherwise it's like
what it's supposed to be.

3449
01:26:53,631 --> 01:26:54,464
Go ahead and tell us what you,

3450
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:55,460
what you think it's funny these days,

3451
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:55,710
man.

3452
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:56,100
Yeah.

3453
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:56,930
Did it and you're like,

3454
01:26:56,930 --> 01:26:57,320
ah,

3455
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:58,550
I had a conversation with,

3456
01:26:59,090 --> 01:26:59,720
I'm an out,

3457
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:00,380
I don't give a fuck.

3458
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:02,960
Cheech from Cheech and Chong
at a party once and he's like,

3459
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,340
what are you talking about on stage?

3460
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:05,211
I go all,

3461
01:27:05,211 --> 01:27:05,990
you know,

3462
01:27:05,990 --> 01:27:06,760
whatever.

3463
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,090
Whatever I think is interesting.

3464
01:27:08,091 --> 01:27:08,310
You know,

3465
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:09,590
whatever was going on in my life,

3466
01:27:09,591 --> 01:27:10,424
you know what I mean?

3467
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,271
What are you talking about now?

3468
01:27:11,271 --> 01:27:12,290
Like tell me some of your material.

3469
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:12,801
I go,

3470
01:27:12,801 --> 01:27:13,634
what?

3471
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:14,743
What?

3472
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:15,741
This is what I said to him.

3473
01:27:15,741 --> 01:27:16,410
What?

3474
01:27:16,410 --> 01:27:17,240
What'd you just say?

3475
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:17,990
Come on man.

3476
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:18,501
Fuck out of here.

3477
01:27:18,501 --> 01:27:19,670
I'm not telling you my material.

3478
01:27:20,330 --> 01:27:20,730
This is what I,

3479
01:27:20,730 --> 01:27:21,501
that's gross.

3480
01:27:21,501 --> 01:27:21,720
Yeah,

3481
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:22,553
it is gross.

3482
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:22,911
You won't,

3483
01:27:22,911 --> 01:27:23,330
you know,

3484
01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:25,090
if you ever want to come to a show and,

3485
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:26,910
well the thing is too like kind of I,

3486
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:27,890
he kept going to like,

3487
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:28,311
so what are you,

3488
01:27:28,311 --> 01:27:28,551
come on,

3489
01:27:28,551 --> 01:27:29,390
tell me what you're talking about.

3490
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:31,550
This is really what it
comes down to to like,

3491
01:27:31,551 --> 01:27:33,620
it's like all you have to do,

3492
01:27:33,650 --> 01:27:34,470
if you have a comment,

3493
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:37,730
if you're a radio station
or whatever it a Dj is,

3494
01:27:37,731 --> 01:27:40,190
just have the minimum amount,

3495
01:27:40,570 --> 01:27:43,310
like feign interest in
who's in front of you,

3496
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:47,780
like just a little bit and you can get
a conversation going that there's going

3497
01:27:47,781 --> 01:27:49,340
to be interesting and funny.

3498
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,320
And like usually if it's somebody famous,

3499
01:27:51,321 --> 01:27:51,741
like if you,

3500
01:27:51,741 --> 01:27:52,280
they go,

3501
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:53,360
it's already in their head.

3502
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:54,200
So they'll be like,

3503
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:56,290
I love news radio or you sweat though.

3504
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:57,140
So they'll ask you like,

3505
01:27:57,141 --> 01:27:57,561
what about this?

3506
01:27:57,561 --> 01:27:58,940
And they can get something going.

3507
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:00,770
But if they don't know who you are,

3508
01:28:00,771 --> 01:28:01,670
they don't recognize you.

3509
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,020
They sometimes,

3510
01:28:03,021 --> 01:28:03,350
some,

3511
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:03,921
not all of them,

3512
01:28:03,921 --> 01:28:05,300
but some of them will
literally just be like,

3513
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:06,830
so what's up?

3514
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:07,401
And like,

3515
01:28:07,401 --> 01:28:08,270
you're on the air and you're like,

3516
01:28:08,890 --> 01:28:09,080
uh,

3517
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:10,460
flew in what?

3518
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:12,253
I'm tired.

3519
01:28:12,290 --> 01:28:13,123
And they're like,

3520
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:13,731
do you have any?

3521
01:28:13,731 --> 01:28:14,900
Like you want to get into
your shit and you're like,

3522
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:16,730
just really like,

3523
01:28:17,210 --> 01:28:18,680
I'm just going to fucking
dance around right now.

3524
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,870
Maybe it's people that just
don't understand stand up,

3525
01:28:20,930 --> 01:28:21,381
I guess.

3526
01:28:21,381 --> 01:28:22,214
You know?

3527
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:23,120
I just,

3528
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:26,330
it always makes it like this is
like weird and then you leave it.

3529
01:28:26,331 --> 01:28:26,990
Like that was fun.

3530
01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:28,850
That wasn't a promotion for the show.

3531
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:30,080
That was just awkwardness.

3532
01:28:30,081 --> 01:28:30,471
Yeah.

3533
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:34,340
That was really awkward and painful and
I don't want anything to do with that.

3534
01:28:34,341 --> 01:28:34,580
Again,

3535
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:37,490
I don't think a lot of those guys that
are doing radio want to be doing it that

3536
01:28:37,491 --> 01:28:38,150
way either.

3537
01:28:38,150 --> 01:28:40,850
It was a lot of them that
are stuck with a real format.

3538
01:28:40,851 --> 01:28:41,684
They have to follow up.

3539
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:42,420
Yeah.

3540
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:43,370
That's a bitch dude.

3541
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:45,890
When you're hanging around with
people and you know their shit,

3542
01:28:45,891 --> 01:28:49,040
they can't talk about any more
breaks they have to hit and you know.

3543
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:49,440
Yeah.

3544
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,470
But that just sounds like
people just suck at radio.

3545
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:52,130
They do.

3546
01:28:52,130 --> 01:28:52,400
Yeah.

3547
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,233
Some of them do.

3548
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:53,620
You know,

3549
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:55,150
some of them just don't like,

3550
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:58,550
I think he would just look up one
thing on somebody can be like,

3551
01:28:58,580 --> 01:28:59,413
what's up with this dude?

3552
01:28:59,630 --> 01:29:00,770
Well I think a lot of people,

3553
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:01,400
um,

3554
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:02,280
are not that interesting.

3555
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:02,911
Yeah.

3556
01:29:02,911 --> 01:29:03,930
And that's the reality of it.

3557
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:05,430
They shouldn't really be Djs,

3558
01:29:05,431 --> 01:29:08,580
but they've worked hard at it and they've
pushed themselves into a situation

3559
01:29:08,581 --> 01:29:09,300
where there,

3560
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:09,541
you know,

3561
01:29:09,541 --> 01:29:11,970
on TV all the or on the
radio rather all the time.

3562
01:29:11,971 --> 01:29:14,370
We actually have a little
bit of a following and then
they get a little bit of

3563
01:29:14,371 --> 01:29:16,680
an ego behind it and they
think they're special.

3564
01:29:16,710 --> 01:29:17,543
Yeah.

3565
01:29:18,510 --> 01:29:22,200
I would like to buy a book of just like
a thousand people doing their stinkeye

3566
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:25,260
like different versions of their
stinkeye cause everyone is a little bit

3567
01:29:25,261 --> 01:29:25,621
different.

3568
01:29:25,621 --> 01:29:27,060
It would have to be a
legit stinkeye though.

3569
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:28,883
Let me see your state guy.

3570
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:29,401
I don't know.

3571
01:29:29,401 --> 01:29:30,840
You'd have to say something stupid again.

3572
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:31,973
I'll give it to you.

3573
01:29:32,490 --> 01:29:33,061
How about that?

3574
01:29:33,061 --> 01:29:33,894
Ready?

3575
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:36,450
I shaved my boss the other
day and I have a mole on,

3576
01:29:36,451 --> 01:29:37,950
I forgot about it and I cut it off.

3577
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:38,783
Is that okay?

3578
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:39,901
Yeah,

3579
01:29:39,901 --> 01:29:40,141
you should.

3580
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:41,370
Probably you'd be okay.

3581
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:41,910
Okay.

3582
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:43,340
Melissa can be cut off right,

3583
01:29:43,341 --> 01:29:43,591
but your,

3584
01:29:43,591 --> 01:29:47,010
your balls are probably like a fucking
water balloon and that's going to be a

3585
01:29:47,011 --> 01:29:47,341
whole,

3586
01:29:47,341 --> 01:29:49,950
we're all your loads going
to leak out of next time.

3587
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:51,870
Next time you come it's
going to be like dust.

3588
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:56,750
It's one of those big weird ones that
some people have under their eyes.

3589
01:29:57,510 --> 01:29:58,770
Put a bandaid on that bitch.

3590
01:29:58,840 --> 01:29:59,600
Don't worry about it.

3591
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,230
If it starts to swell up and hurt,

3592
01:30:01,231 --> 01:30:02,064
go to a doctor.

3593
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:02,953
Okay.

3594
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:03,793
Clean it off.

3595
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:04,410
It was just,

3596
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:05,011
I just have the one,

3597
01:30:05,011 --> 01:30:07,620
it was like one of the ones that stick
out a little like that's called a wart.

3598
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:08,240
No,

3599
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:08,361
no,

3600
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:08,541
no,

3601
01:30:08,541 --> 01:30:08,701
no,

3602
01:30:08,701 --> 01:30:08,881
no,

3603
01:30:08,881 --> 01:30:09,001
no.

3604
01:30:09,001 --> 01:30:09,480
It's a mall.

3605
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,250
It's a lot of comparisons
of that little baby.

3606
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:11,880
Yeah.

3607
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:12,750
You might want to get it free.

3608
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,950
One in five round,

3609
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:16,080
whatever dog.

3610
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:17,311
Get that shit.

3611
01:30:17,311 --> 01:30:18,550
[inaudible] now it is.

3612
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:20,240
Most of it is gone or the whole thing.

3613
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:21,870
I cut the whole thing off man.

3614
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:24,330
It hurt like crazy.

3615
01:30:24,331 --> 01:30:25,170
Seems kind of stupid.

3616
01:30:25,171 --> 01:30:25,921
Did you like half?

3617
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:26,790
We cut it off and figure,

3618
01:30:26,791 --> 01:30:27,150
well,

3619
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:29,490
now that I'm here and why don't I
just pick at it until it looks like

3620
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:30,440
symmetrical.

3621
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:31,650
Is it Gillette sensor

3622
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:36,510
senses from Callan who,

3623
01:30:36,870 --> 01:30:37,111
yeah,

3624
01:30:37,111 --> 01:30:38,370
he gave me a whole trunk full.

3625
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,233
Did he really know?

3626
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,210
Is Kay Callan is doing to Gillette sensor?

3627
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:44,210
I know it's all over fucking TV.

3628
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:45,640
That little Esther and the bankers.

3629
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:48,330
How accounts a Gillette
sensor commercials.

3630
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:50,570
It's just commercial or like

3631
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:53,280
a coast.

3632
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:53,711
Oh really?

3633
01:30:53,711 --> 01:30:54,544
Yeah.

3634
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:56,280
He's such a talented guy.

3635
01:30:56,281 --> 01:30:58,470
I'm always confused as to
why that guy is not huge.

3636
01:30:58,740 --> 01:30:59,700
As long as I've known him,

3637
01:30:59,701 --> 01:31:00,000
I'm like,

3638
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,970
someone's going to be one day where
someone's going to figure out that Brian

3639
01:31:03,970 --> 01:31:03,990
Collins,

3640
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:05,190
one of the funniest people on the planet,

3641
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:05,930
boom.

3642
01:31:05,930 --> 01:31:06,360
Explode.

3643
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:06,811
It's going to be,

3644
01:31:06,811 --> 01:31:09,150
I'm not huge movies and yeah.

3645
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:09,901
Well he is.

3646
01:31:09,901 --> 01:31:11,880
And some of these little
right little parts,

3647
01:31:11,881 --> 01:31:12,240
but yeah,

3648
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:13,470
that guy is so fucking funny.

3649
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,110
He's one of the funniest people
I've ever met in my life.

3650
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:16,680
Yeah,

3651
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:17,700
he's really fucking funny,

3652
01:31:17,701 --> 01:31:18,510
man.

3653
01:31:18,510 --> 01:31:18,991
He does.

3654
01:31:18,991 --> 01:31:19,310
Uh,

3655
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:20,700
he's thinking about doing a podcast.

3656
01:31:20,701 --> 01:31:21,421
He's a on the,

3657
01:31:21,421 --> 01:31:22,500
on the cusp right now.

3658
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:22,890
There's any,

3659
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:23,460
Brian,

3660
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:24,420
did you talk to them about it?

3661
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:24,931
Uh,

3662
01:31:24,931 --> 01:31:25,350
no.

3663
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:26,320
I've never talked to him about it.

3664
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:27,420
He's eventually going to do it.

3665
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:27,901
I know.

3666
01:31:27,901 --> 01:31:28,200
He goes,

3667
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:29,033
he's perfect for it.

3668
01:31:29,850 --> 01:31:31,620
He's got a a mountain of information.

3669
01:31:31,621 --> 01:31:32,520
So I've said not all of it.

3670
01:31:32,521 --> 01:31:32,821
Correct.

3671
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:33,654
But that's all right.

3672
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:35,600
Who does fascinating.

3673
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:37,200
It will own up to it though.

3674
01:31:37,201 --> 01:31:37,411
It's like,

3675
01:31:37,411 --> 01:31:37,711
Oh yeah,

3676
01:31:37,711 --> 01:31:38,670
I fucked up about that one.

3677
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:39,490
Like you know,

3678
01:31:39,490 --> 01:31:40,530
I'll call them on the phone.

3679
01:31:40,531 --> 01:31:40,610
The,

3680
01:31:40,610 --> 01:31:40,851
I said,

3681
01:31:40,851 --> 01:31:40,981
Yo,

3682
01:31:40,981 --> 01:31:42,840
I got a lot of Twitter is
about some shit you said.

3683
01:31:42,841 --> 01:31:43,200
Yeah.

3684
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:43,380
Yeah.

3685
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:44,213
I fucked up a few of them.

3686
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:45,001
Oh,

3687
01:31:45,001 --> 01:31:45,990
but full disclosure,

3688
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:48,690
I might've fucked up tons of
information with the Machu Picchu.

3689
01:31:48,691 --> 01:31:49,260
Sure.

3690
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:50,340
So don't email me.

3691
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:51,930
Don't tell me how wrong I was.

3692
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:52,830
I been up there.

3693
01:31:52,830 --> 01:31:53,730
You've been up there twice.

3694
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:54,320
Three times.

3695
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,220
If you've ever been to
any of the mine sites,

3696
01:31:56,221 --> 01:31:58,290
like teaching Eatsa or no pullover.

3697
01:31:58,650 --> 01:31:59,710
I've only been at Chichen Eatsa,

3698
01:31:59,730 --> 01:31:59,980
but that

3699
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:00,191
was,

3700
01:32:00,191 --> 01:32:00,850
I was enough.

3701
01:32:00,850 --> 01:32:02,200
That was enough to freak me the fuck out.

3702
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:02,501
I did.

3703
01:32:02,501 --> 01:32:02,770
Right.

3704
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:04,210
What did you think when
you first saw that?

3705
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:04,511
Well,

3706
01:32:04,511 --> 01:32:07,270
I've been a huge fan of uh,

3707
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:07,661
you know,

3708
01:32:07,661 --> 01:32:08,110
the,

3709
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:11,740
the Mayan culture and how bizarre they
were and how their writing was in this

3710
01:32:11,741 --> 01:32:14,830
weird sort of hieroglyphs
images that represented,

3711
01:32:15,490 --> 01:32:15,880
I mean,

3712
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:16,030
uh,

3713
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:16,780
so I had,

3714
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:18,250
I'd really gotten into it.

3715
01:32:18,251 --> 01:32:20,590
I read a lot of books about it
before I ever went down there.

3716
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:22,570
And then once I went
down there I was like,

3717
01:32:22,571 --> 01:32:24,010
this is so incredible.

3718
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:25,061
You know,

3719
01:32:25,061 --> 01:32:25,211
it's,

3720
01:32:25,211 --> 01:32:27,610
it's just hard to believe
that these people from,

3721
01:32:27,611 --> 01:32:28,060
you know,

3722
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:31,210
x amount of thousands of years ago
created this and then it's still here.

3723
01:32:31,570 --> 01:32:35,440
But the thing that really sealed it
for me was I got a guy who is a local

3724
01:32:35,441 --> 01:32:39,360
professor who was one of
the guides and you paid him.

3725
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:41,110
I paid him like whatever it was,

3726
01:32:41,111 --> 01:32:44,140
I gave him like double what
he was supposed to make
cause he was super cool and

3727
01:32:44,141 --> 01:32:45,430
he takes me on this tour,

3728
01:32:45,431 --> 01:32:50,431
a personal one on one tour and we go
to all these different spots and it

3729
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:54,220
explains what they created this
for and what is designed for.

3730
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,660
And he took me to this one spot.

3731
01:32:55,661 --> 01:32:55,961
He's like,

3732
01:32:55,961 --> 01:32:57,610
this is the place where
they would do the list,

3733
01:32:57,611 --> 01:33:00,280
ceramic acid that they would
take from all these plants.

3734
01:33:00,730 --> 01:33:01,360
And this was like,

3735
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:04,150
well they would have psychedelic
rituals and they probably mushrooms.

3736
01:33:04,190 --> 01:33:07,300
He's telling me about all these different
things they did like and that's when

3737
01:33:07,301 --> 01:33:09,790
the whole mind thing had
pieced together from me.

3738
01:33:09,791 --> 01:33:11,440
Cause I had just started doing mushrooms.

3739
01:33:11,441 --> 01:33:14,260
I just had like a couple of
trips before I'd ever went there.

3740
01:33:14,410 --> 01:33:18,400
So then when I went there and I saw
that these people were fucking trippers,

3741
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:19,000
I'm like,

3742
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:19,920
oh well that,

3743
01:33:19,921 --> 01:33:21,910
that explains so much.

3744
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:25,360
I was wondering why would anybody
build these crazy geometric patterns,

3745
01:33:25,361 --> 01:33:29,650
that mirror of the cosmos and he's
incredible elaborate stone structures.

3746
01:33:29,651 --> 01:33:30,484
Like what was going on?

3747
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:30,821
Oh,

3748
01:33:30,821 --> 01:33:32,000
they were tripping their balls off.

3749
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:33,220
Do they tell you that too?

3750
01:33:33,221 --> 01:33:33,970
Like he explained it.

3751
01:33:33,970 --> 01:33:34,640
He did.

3752
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:34,910
The,

3753
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:35,121
the,

3754
01:33:35,121 --> 01:33:36,040
the professor did.

3755
01:33:36,041 --> 01:33:36,281
Yeah,

3756
01:33:36,281 --> 01:33:39,130
he went into depth about it because I
told him that something I was really

3757
01:33:39,131 --> 01:33:40,480
interested in and I said,

3758
01:33:40,481 --> 01:33:40,721
I'm,

3759
01:33:40,721 --> 01:33:42,580
I'm always fascinated by the,

3760
01:33:42,581 --> 01:33:43,030
uh,

3761
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:46,030
the different ways in ancient culture
is altered this state of consciousness,

3762
01:33:46,031 --> 01:33:47,380
whether it was alcohol or you know,

3763
01:33:47,381 --> 01:33:48,790
the pod for the Indians or whatever.

3764
01:33:48,970 --> 01:33:53,710
And so he also had a lot of
knowledge about that particular area.

3765
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:57,940
So he talked to me in depth about what
they believe happened and where this is

3766
01:33:57,941 --> 01:33:59,140
what they were used for rituals.

3767
01:33:59,141 --> 01:34:00,850
And it's certain the symbols,

3768
01:34:00,890 --> 01:34:01,240
uh,

3769
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:04,300
indicate that they use certain different
psychedelic plants and mushrooms.

3770
01:34:05,410 --> 01:34:07,060
Fucking of course that's what happened.

3771
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:08,110
I mean,

3772
01:34:08,110 --> 01:34:08,470
you know,

3773
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:09,310
they tripped balls,

3774
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:13,280
they had some crazy ideas and then
it'll get a little out of hand.

3775
01:34:15,370 --> 01:34:16,420
They always get out of hand,

3776
01:34:16,421 --> 01:34:16,910
man,

3777
01:34:16,910 --> 01:34:19,060
as basically those South
American fucking culture is,

3778
01:34:19,061 --> 01:34:19,960
it's too hot down there,

3779
01:34:19,961 --> 01:34:20,680
dude.

3780
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:21,520
People get wacky,

3781
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:22,090
you know,

3782
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:25,390
start slicing people over a fucking don't
drink enough water and next thing you

3783
01:34:25,391 --> 01:34:25,481
know,

3784
01:34:25,481 --> 01:34:26,890
you're making a human sacrifice.

3785
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:27,280
Yeah.

3786
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:28,240
That shits crazy.

3787
01:34:28,241 --> 01:34:28,570
Right.

3788
01:34:28,570 --> 01:34:29,770
Human sacrifice.

3789
01:34:29,820 --> 01:34:31,490
He did a lot of it ritually.

3790
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:31,780
Yeah.

3791
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:32,021
You know,

3792
01:34:32,021 --> 01:34:34,990
there's speculation about
that game that they played,

3793
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:35,351
you know,

3794
01:34:35,351 --> 01:34:36,520
that football game,

3795
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:39,640
which they believed at one point in
time they played with human heads.

3796
01:34:39,850 --> 01:34:41,530
They don't necessarily
believe that anymore.

3797
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:44,200
They believe they may have played
some games with human heads,

3798
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:49,060
but they believe that the winners of the
game were the ones who got sacrificed.

3799
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:49,990
Really?

3800
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:50,670
Yeah.

3801
01:34:50,670 --> 01:34:51,610
So they don't know.

3802
01:34:51,611 --> 01:34:51,791
I mean,

3803
01:34:51,791 --> 01:34:55,390
there's some speculation and we tried
to lose as much as possible at least.

3804
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:56,500
I mean,

3805
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:56,780
there's,

3806
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:57,160
uh,

3807
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:00,650
an amazing National Geographic
special on decoding Maya.

3808
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:02,690
I think it's actually
called that decoding my,

3809
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:06,380
about how hard it's been to decode their
language and trying to figure out what

3810
01:35:06,381 --> 01:35:07,130
the fuck,

3811
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:07,371
you know,

3812
01:35:07,371 --> 01:35:08,940
these guys were talking about.

3813
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:10,190
It's so complex,

3814
01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:11,630
but you know,

3815
01:35:11,630 --> 01:35:13,280
just that alone,

3816
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:14,233
you know,

3817
01:35:14,730 --> 01:35:16,960
it's all their structures.

3818
01:35:16,990 --> 01:35:18,650
They left behind the,

3819
01:35:18,770 --> 01:35:19,370
you know,

3820
01:35:19,370 --> 01:35:23,570
the amazing sophistication of their
culture and yet they are still killing

3821
01:35:23,571 --> 01:35:27,350
people and sacrificing and mother
and may be killing the winners.

3822
01:35:27,830 --> 01:35:28,280
Yeah.

3823
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:28,641
You know,

3824
01:35:28,641 --> 01:35:31,370
the quiet why it's what were you doing?

3825
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:32,233
You're the best man.

3826
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:33,000
What were they doing?

3827
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,700
W but the way that they were just,

3828
01:35:35,170 --> 01:35:39,560
they were just fucking trip and
balls hardcore all the time.

3829
01:35:39,561 --> 01:35:42,830
That's why I think it was almost
like that is what would happen.

3830
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:46,520
What would happen to the society if you
were just fucking tripping your balls

3831
01:35:46,521 --> 01:35:47,354
out all the time.

3832
01:35:47,390 --> 01:35:50,180
Well you would make these incredible
pyramids and you would keep making them

3833
01:35:50,270 --> 01:35:54,440
doper and doper like Cheech and
pizza and she needs is amazing man.

3834
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:55,520
It's just incredible.

3835
01:35:55,521 --> 01:35:59,000
One structure after another and in mind
blowing shit and then he would start

3836
01:35:59,001 --> 01:36:01,400
playing football with
human heads and you know,

3837
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:02,750
fucking,

3838
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:06,020
you would just go deep and you would want
to kill people because you would know

3839
01:36:06,021 --> 01:36:07,430
that they would go to the next place,

3840
01:36:07,660 --> 01:36:08,221
the next place.

3841
01:36:08,221 --> 01:36:10,670
It'd be amazing cause you already been
there cause you're tripping balls.

3842
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,860
So like you're tripping
balls while you're cutting.

3843
01:36:12,861 --> 01:36:16,340
Someone's beating heart out and you're
watching them as you're tripping your

3844
01:36:16,341 --> 01:36:16,851
balls off,

3845
01:36:16,851 --> 01:36:19,370
you're watching them transfer
into the next dimension.

3846
01:36:19,371 --> 01:36:19,890
Yeah,

3847
01:36:19,890 --> 01:36:20,580
come on.

3848
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:21,413
Yeah.

3849
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:23,030
Too much mushrooms.

3850
01:36:23,031 --> 01:36:24,380
That's what keeps you awake at night.

3851
01:36:25,930 --> 01:36:26,763
That's ridiculous.

3852
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:27,381
But look,

3853
01:36:27,381 --> 01:36:27,711
man,

3854
01:36:27,711 --> 01:36:30,380
if you look at all these
different things that are here,

3855
01:36:30,381 --> 01:36:30,770
these,

3856
01:36:30,770 --> 01:36:32,180
the Cheecha needs says though,

3857
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:32,691
you know,

3858
01:36:32,691 --> 01:36:32,961
the,

3859
01:36:32,961 --> 01:36:33,380
um,

3860
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:33,860
uh,

3861
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:34,401
go Beckley,

3862
01:36:34,401 --> 01:36:35,660
Tapley and in Turkey,

3863
01:36:35,661 --> 01:36:39,560
all these different things that are here
that show that there's been all these

3864
01:36:39,561 --> 01:36:40,281
different ancient,

3865
01:36:40,281 --> 01:36:42,410
ancient civilizations
that existed for so long.

3866
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:43,060
I,

3867
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:45,590
I wonder how many of them
were inspired by drugs.

3868
01:36:45,890 --> 01:36:48,620
I wonder how many of her were inspired
by some dude who picked something up,

3869
01:36:48,621 --> 01:36:48,981
ate it,

3870
01:36:48,981 --> 01:36:50,990
and had his fucking crazy freaky idea.

3871
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:52,360
Here's what we gotta do.

3872
01:36:52,620 --> 01:36:53,030
Yeah.

3873
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:54,740
We're building a city up
here in the mountains.

3874
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:58,730
We probably lost contact with all that
shit and things are nice and easy now.

3875
01:36:58,731 --> 01:37:01,460
So we don't need psychedelic drugs to
try to figure out the world anymore.

3876
01:37:01,461 --> 01:37:02,450
At least we don't think we do.

3877
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:04,520
That's probably what the fuck is going on.

3878
01:37:04,730 --> 01:37:06,230
That's probably why this
world's falling apart.

3879
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:08,660
If we could write it somehow,

3880
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:13,040
that would be the way you
saw a massive mushroom day.

3881
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:16,910
Do you know how much a mushroom
day would do for this world?

3882
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:17,960
A national,

3883
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:21,290
national mushroom day would
change America forever.

3884
01:37:21,350 --> 01:37:22,160
Forever.

3885
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:23,540
When we just had one day,

3886
01:37:23,780 --> 01:37:28,780
if we had a national mushroom day where
they opened up places where people could

3887
01:37:29,001 --> 01:37:33,050
buy mushrooms and they had medical staff
waiting 24 hours a day for people who

3888
01:37:33,051 --> 01:37:34,460
are freaking out and you know,

3889
01:37:34,461 --> 01:37:36,230
you signed up and you went into these,

3890
01:37:36,231 --> 01:37:36,800
you know,

3891
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:40,920
fucking bunk rooms and everyone took
it together and everyone was cool.

3892
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:43,550
They had security around a lot
of people that weren't high.

3893
01:37:43,790 --> 01:37:44,870
That's the whole thing you want to know,

3894
01:37:44,871 --> 01:37:45,111
right?

3895
01:37:45,111 --> 01:37:47,310
It's like you want to be told
everything's gonna be all right.

3896
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:48,210
That'd be cooked.

3897
01:37:48,210 --> 01:37:49,043
Went through my insurance.

3898
01:37:49,070 --> 01:37:51,620
75% of the population probably suck.

3899
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:53,000
A lot of people would freak out.

3900
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:54,140
A lot of people would freak out,

3901
01:37:54,141 --> 01:37:55,130
but my man,

3902
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:56,770
all the people who didn't freak out,

3903
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:58,350
even if they did freak out,

3904
01:37:58,351 --> 01:38:00,780
they'd probably learn something from
it and everybody would come back with a

3905
01:38:00,781 --> 01:38:04,860
reinvigorated sense of who we are and
how we interface with each other on this

3906
01:38:04,861 --> 01:38:05,280
planet.

3907
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:06,480
How many thought about that?

3908
01:38:06,481 --> 01:38:07,261
How many times have you done it?

3909
01:38:07,261 --> 01:38:08,094
He's done a lot.

3910
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,290
Tion seven times.

3911
01:38:10,410 --> 01:38:11,040
Mushrooms.

3912
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:11,520
Yeah.

3913
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:14,220
And bump been DMT and mushrooms
both about the same times

3914
01:38:14,510 --> 01:38:15,151
you have it.

3915
01:38:15,151 --> 01:38:15,984
You have a lot.

3916
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:17,810
Hundreds,

3917
01:38:17,810 --> 01:38:17,840
hundreds.

3918
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:21,820
I mean I've been doing it since I was
15 so he's worse poster boy ever from

3919
01:38:21,821 --> 01:38:22,281
mushrooms.

3920
01:38:22,281 --> 01:38:22,880
Right.

3921
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:23,780
This motherfucker,

3922
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:24,920
he's just like the Mayans.

3923
01:38:25,670 --> 01:38:27,620
Do you worship Poom serpents now?

3924
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:28,280
No.

3925
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:28,981
That's crazy man.

3926
01:38:28,981 --> 01:38:29,690
That's a lot.

3927
01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:30,430
I've never done it.

3928
01:38:30,430 --> 01:38:31,700
Well I used to do acid a lot,

3929
01:38:31,701 --> 01:38:32,660
but then I started doing,

3930
01:38:32,750 --> 01:38:34,660
I switched just in my
Sherman slam when I was like,

3931
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:36,760
it's like I was doing them all bros,

3932
01:38:36,790 --> 01:38:37,990
but I went to Marlboro Lights.

3933
01:38:37,991 --> 01:38:38,410
Yeah,

3934
01:38:38,410 --> 01:38:39,940
I switched to just mushrooms,

3935
01:38:39,941 --> 01:38:40,774
you know.

3936
01:38:40,810 --> 01:38:42,340
That's how I took my non-reality.

3937
01:38:42,730 --> 01:38:43,240
Yeah.

3938
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:45,600
As you think about doing it in
Montana when I was there last weekend,

3939
01:38:45,610 --> 01:38:47,140
but I was like that's a
heavy a place to do it.

3940
01:38:47,170 --> 01:38:47,771
A bad ass.

3941
01:38:47,771 --> 01:38:48,221
But there's,

3942
01:38:48,221 --> 01:38:49,420
to me there's people,

3943
01:38:49,421 --> 01:38:50,590
there was people there by the way,

3944
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:51,820
I didn't mean to tell you about this yet.

3945
01:38:51,850 --> 01:38:53,260
There was at the hotel,

3946
01:38:53,410 --> 01:38:56,170
there was these two guys on motorcycles
and they had like this little girl that

3947
01:38:56,171 --> 01:38:59,650
was like four years old and they were
like checking in and I was like behind

3948
01:38:59,651 --> 01:39:00,000
them.

3949
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,780
So you're riding on a
motorcycle with a four year old.

3950
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:02,021
Yeah,

3951
01:39:02,021 --> 01:39:03,010
it was weird man.

3952
01:39:03,310 --> 01:39:04,570
And so you could do that,

3953
01:39:04,571 --> 01:39:06,880
right if you were in charge of a four
year old and you can probably take them on

3954
01:39:06,881 --> 01:39:07,051
a bus.

3955
01:39:07,051 --> 01:39:09,880
I don't know if this legal and so the
good and that hotel and they're like,

3956
01:39:09,881 --> 01:39:10,001
yeah,

3957
01:39:10,001 --> 01:39:10,930
we needed a bedroom.

3958
01:39:10,930 --> 01:39:11,321
And they're like,

3959
01:39:11,321 --> 01:39:11,801
how many beds?

3960
01:39:11,801 --> 01:39:12,760
And are just like one.

3961
01:39:13,130 --> 01:39:13,841
And I was like,

3962
01:39:13,841 --> 01:39:14,230
wait,

3963
01:39:14,230 --> 01:39:16,450
there's two guys in a little girl.

3964
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:17,171
And I'm like,

3965
01:39:17,171 --> 01:39:17,680
okay.

3966
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:17,961
You know,

3967
01:39:17,961 --> 01:39:19,060
like that's all I can afford.

3968
01:39:19,170 --> 01:39:19,391
I mean,

3969
01:39:19,391 --> 01:39:19,781
beds.

3970
01:39:19,781 --> 01:39:20,614
I mean Ben,

3971
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:21,040
Oh,

3972
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:22,340
you could get it isn't,

3973
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:22,530
it?

3974
01:39:22,530 --> 01:39:24,100
Doesn't it costs more
money for a room too.

3975
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:25,360
But usually I don't think it does,

3976
01:39:25,361 --> 01:39:26,194
but what are,

3977
01:39:26,290 --> 01:39:26,441
uh,

3978
01:39:26,441 --> 01:39:29,290
and then later I saw them again
and they were like in the pool.

3979
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:30,470
One of the guys was in port,

3980
01:39:30,471 --> 01:39:31,001
the looker on,

3981
01:39:31,001 --> 01:39:31,834
he goes,

3982
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:32,530
you're the,

3983
01:39:32,530 --> 01:39:35,640
I'm the best uncle ever
write their daughter or,

3984
01:39:35,641 --> 01:39:36,400
or deer.

3985
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:37,233
And I'm like,

3986
01:39:37,330 --> 01:39:40,870
is he saying that louder on purposes
cause I'm walking by or something.

3987
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:43,470
It was just really odd.

3988
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:45,950
He was putting on a show like you
can't uncle and then he's really,

3989
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:47,330
it was,

3990
01:39:47,330 --> 01:39:47,750
it was,

3991
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:49,120
it was really awkward.

3992
01:39:49,121 --> 01:39:49,331
Anyway,

3993
01:39:49,331 --> 01:39:49,991
so then I was like,

3994
01:39:49,991 --> 01:39:50,261
you know what,

3995
01:39:50,261 --> 01:39:51,071
I'm not gonna eat mushrooms here.

3996
01:39:51,071 --> 01:39:52,030
I'm just going to

3997
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:55,680
be really aware of your environment.

3998
01:39:55,710 --> 01:39:57,130
You want to start fucking around with,

3999
01:39:57,131 --> 01:40:01,810
you already have like some thoughts going
on that are negative or something you

4000
01:40:01,811 --> 01:40:02,644
don't want to.

4001
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:05,870
I think this is how I would
recommend you go about it.

4002
01:40:06,110 --> 01:40:06,950
Number one,

4003
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:07,950
fucking,

4004
01:40:07,950 --> 01:40:10,490
if anybody wants to do
anything psychedelic,

4005
01:40:10,491 --> 01:40:15,170
if you wanted to have like a guideline
of how to have a psychedelic experience,

4006
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:17,210
number one plan on doing it.

4007
01:40:17,890 --> 01:40:20,900
Or someone would say you're gonna give
yourself x amount of time and then you're

4008
01:40:20,901 --> 01:40:21,321
going to do it.

4009
01:40:21,321 --> 01:40:22,220
And in between that,

4010
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:23,450
take care of your health.

4011
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:24,530
Eat good foods,

4012
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,710
don't eat anything fast up fast though.

4013
01:40:27,110 --> 01:40:28,400
The day you do it fast,

4014
01:40:28,401 --> 01:40:29,234
the day you do it,

4015
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:31,910
but keep your body clean like you'll feel,

4016
01:40:31,911 --> 01:40:32,570
feel better,

4017
01:40:32,570 --> 01:40:33,650
do some yoga,

4018
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:37,700
do some yoga like the day before you do
any sort of a psychedelic experience.

4019
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:39,440
If you could do it for a couple days,

4020
01:40:39,470 --> 01:40:42,230
you know a week for like two weeks
and then have the experience.

4021
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:43,940
You want to be relaxed,

4022
01:40:43,970 --> 01:40:48,410
you want to be as calm and as at peace
with yourself and then I would recommend

4023
01:40:48,411 --> 01:40:50,900
if you can get to a tank and do,

4024
01:40:50,930 --> 01:40:52,010
do an isolation tank.

4025
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:52,710
Yes,

4026
01:40:52,710 --> 01:40:54,010
tripping balls and find your,

4027
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:57,160
cause you could find yourself in the
tank and then when you meet yourself,

4028
01:40:57,161 --> 01:40:57,911
when you're on mushrooms,

4029
01:40:57,911 --> 01:41:00,090
you won't be as shocking because you were,

4030
01:41:00,140 --> 01:41:01,600
you'd already found yourself in the tank.

4031
01:41:01,610 --> 01:41:01,841
You're like,

4032
01:41:01,841 --> 01:41:02,141
okay,

4033
01:41:02,141 --> 01:41:02,974
here I am again.

4034
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:06,400
Okay with this time I'm ready for this
and I'm going to escape through this.

4035
01:41:06,401 --> 01:41:09,280
I'm going to realize what this is all
about because in a tank you could always

4036
01:41:09,281 --> 01:41:09,940
just stop it.

4037
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:12,310
You can't stop the
mushroom trip in the tank.

4038
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:13,390
If you're freaking out in the tank,

4039
01:41:13,391 --> 01:41:14,230
you could just open your eyes,

4040
01:41:14,231 --> 01:41:16,480
stand up and get out and
you're a sober like that.

4041
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:17,890
It's instantaneous.

4042
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:19,090
It's cause it's all,

4043
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:19,730
it's,

4044
01:41:19,730 --> 01:41:23,650
it's a natural psychedelic experience
and your body can snap right back to

4045
01:41:23,651 --> 01:41:24,460
normal,

4046
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:25,293
not tripping,

4047
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:26,440
just tank,

4048
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:26,990
tank,

4049
01:41:26,990 --> 01:41:28,450
tank by itself as a trip.

4050
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:29,500
You don't need to do anything.

4051
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:30,513
Small Hall,

4052
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:33,010
just a little bit too
hits is all you need.

4053
01:41:33,010 --> 01:41:35,020
Go in that tank and you've done it.

4054
01:41:35,021 --> 01:41:35,591
You've done the tank,

4055
01:41:35,591 --> 01:41:36,100
right.

4056
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:36,933
Never

4057
01:41:38,380 --> 01:41:39,213
got no balls.

4058
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:41,640
Want to try that balls with a razor.

4059
01:41:41,641 --> 01:41:42,520
They had drained out.

4060
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:47,020
Honestly to me it seems like I would
probably enjoy it but it's like I get,

4061
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,640
I get the idea in my head and I'm like,

4062
01:41:48,641 --> 01:41:48,960
yeah,

4063
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:50,350
I'm sure it'll be relaxing and nice.

4064
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:52,430
I've talked about it
too much and now it's,

4065
01:41:52,470 --> 01:41:53,420
it's fucked in.

4066
01:41:53,421 --> 01:41:56,260
He'll never be able to go into it because
he gets in there and just be thinking

4067
01:41:56,261 --> 01:42:00,800
about me talking about [inaudible] will
pop in my face and I'll go through a of,

4068
01:42:02,750 --> 01:42:05,080
I do want to try on a torrent cricket.

4069
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:05,831
You shouldn't try it.

4070
01:42:05,831 --> 01:42:06,491
A long time ago.

4071
01:42:06,491 --> 01:42:07,324
She doesn't try.

4072
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:08,800
Then once you do that,

4073
01:42:08,830 --> 01:42:10,390
then you're prepared.

4074
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:11,590
Then you got to prepare yourself,

4075
01:42:11,650 --> 01:42:12,421
have a couple of tanks,

4076
01:42:12,421 --> 01:42:13,180
experiences,

4077
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:15,730
then jump into the wonderful
world of mushrooms,

4078
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:19,330
but not until then prepare yourself
and that's the problem man.

4079
01:42:19,330 --> 01:42:20,950
That's the problem with it being illegal.

4080
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:22,150
If that shit was legal,

4081
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:24,610
we could open up centers
and we could fix people.

4082
01:42:24,970 --> 01:42:26,140
We could help a lot of people.

4083
01:42:26,141 --> 01:42:26,590
Not Wheat,

4084
01:42:26,590 --> 01:42:26,981
not me.

4085
01:42:26,981 --> 01:42:27,940
I'm not opening up shit.

4086
01:42:27,941 --> 01:42:28,750
Don't ask me.

4087
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:28,991
No,

4088
01:42:28,991 --> 01:42:30,190
I'm not joining your business.

4089
01:42:30,191 --> 01:42:30,730
No,

4090
01:42:30,730 --> 01:42:30,971
no,

4091
01:42:30,971 --> 01:42:32,380
not a limited LLC.

4092
01:42:32,381 --> 01:42:32,800
No,

4093
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:33,131
no.

4094
01:42:33,131 --> 01:42:34,270
I ain't got no time.

4095
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:36,490
I mean we as in the human race,

4096
01:42:36,670 --> 01:42:37,570
there was a lot of streams.

4097
01:42:37,571 --> 01:42:38,060
I think this is,

4098
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:38,831
I was in Asheville,

4099
01:42:38,831 --> 01:42:39,510
North Carolina.

4100
01:42:39,510 --> 01:42:40,570
He was a lot of shootings up.

4101
01:42:40,610 --> 01:42:41,530
They allowed US rooms.

4102
01:42:41,531 --> 01:42:43,150
There was a cool place for Schumann.

4103
01:42:43,210 --> 01:42:43,901
Yeah man.

4104
01:42:43,901 --> 01:42:44,850
And there was this,

4105
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:45,790
I had a great,

4106
01:42:45,791 --> 01:42:48,370
I did the Asheville comedy
festival this past weekend,

4107
01:42:48,820 --> 01:42:49,690
this past weekend.

4108
01:42:49,691 --> 01:42:50,410
This past weekend.

4109
01:42:50,410 --> 01:42:50,771
Really?

4110
01:42:50,771 --> 01:42:52,050
I didn't even know they had a comedy.

4111
01:42:52,070 --> 01:42:52,581
So there who,

4112
01:42:52,581 --> 01:42:53,414
who you up there with?

4113
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:55,000
It was called laugh.

4114
01:42:55,001 --> 01:42:57,220
You're Asheville off is
the name of the festival.

4115
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:57,761
It's clever.

4116
01:42:57,761 --> 01:42:58,331
Play on words.

4117
01:42:58,331 --> 01:42:58,780
By the way,

4118
01:42:58,780 --> 01:43:01,450
I'm taking my Alpha
brainwave formula right now.

4119
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:03,580
I'd take three.

4120
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:04,473
These are the,

4121
01:43:04,490 --> 01:43:08,270
these are our brain are
super brain pro earlier.

4122
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:09,460
That's why strong feel stupid.

4123
01:43:09,490 --> 01:43:10,240
By the way.

4124
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:11,920
Chris is coming into town next month,

4125
01:43:12,190 --> 01:43:12,420
Chris,

4126
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:12,820
anymore.

4127
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:13,653
I know.

4128
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:15,460
Change his name to Aubrey seem who,

4129
01:43:15,461 --> 01:43:16,240
what?

4130
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:18,580
We can show you positive and
negative examples of drugs.

4131
01:43:18,581 --> 01:43:19,510
I'm a much nicer person,

4132
01:43:19,511 --> 01:43:20,500
but because of drugs,

4133
01:43:20,501 --> 01:43:20,741
me,

4134
01:43:20,741 --> 01:43:21,580
I'm much nicer,

4135
01:43:21,581 --> 01:43:22,540
much more introspective.

4136
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:23,351
But you know,

4137
01:43:23,351 --> 01:43:26,380
Brian's done mushrooms a hundred times
and listened to him talk and then he got

4138
01:43:26,381 --> 01:43:27,970
our friend Chris who
changed his name to Aubrey.

4139
01:43:28,030 --> 01:43:28,510
Yeah.

4140
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:29,291
After he had some,

4141
01:43:29,291 --> 01:43:29,520
uh,

4142
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:30,580
I'll ask experiences.

4143
01:43:30,581 --> 01:43:31,414
Seriously.

4144
01:43:33,490 --> 01:43:34,630
Deep dig,

4145
01:43:34,631 --> 01:43:38,140
dig deep into the jungles of the mind to
the point where he wanted to stop being

4146
01:43:38,141 --> 01:43:39,070
the person who he was.

4147
01:43:39,190 --> 01:43:40,450
So he changed his fucking name.

4148
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:44,140
Shazamm did you see a
coffer brain formula?

4149
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:45,100
It's coming out soon.

4150
01:43:45,130 --> 01:43:47,300
Did he send you the pictures of

4151
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:49,900
hangover credits?

4152
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:50,530
Don't say that.

4153
01:43:50,530 --> 01:43:51,140
Don't talk.

4154
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:51,470
Is that,

4155
01:43:51,470 --> 01:43:52,070
what is that?

4156
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:52,820
What is my,

4157
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:54,200
my shit that we're going to be selling.

4158
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,990
It's a nootropics and what it is in ward,

4159
01:43:56,991 --> 01:43:57,330
we're going to be,

4160
01:43:57,330 --> 01:43:57,921
we're done with this.

4161
01:43:57,921 --> 01:44:00,890
He's coming the end of July,

4162
01:44:00,890 --> 01:44:00,891
July,

4163
01:44:00,891 --> 01:44:01,724
early August.

4164
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:02,120
Um,

4165
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:02,661
and then we're going to,

4166
01:44:02,661 --> 01:44:03,410
it will,

4167
01:44:03,410 --> 01:44:04,750
it'll launch right after that.

4168
01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:08,360
What it is is it's basically the highest
level brain nutrients that we could

4169
01:44:08,361 --> 01:44:09,680
find mixed them all together.

4170
01:44:09,780 --> 01:44:10,730
And Chris,

4171
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:11,181
excuse me,

4172
01:44:11,181 --> 01:44:15,470
Aubrey worked very hard on this
formula and tweaked it and you know,

4173
01:44:15,471 --> 01:44:19,040
it's basically all the information's
available online and all this stuff is

4174
01:44:19,041 --> 01:44:19,520
available.

4175
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,353
We don't have,

4176
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:21,140
we don't have anything.

4177
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:23,270
There's nothing in here that
you can't buy individually.

4178
01:44:23,450 --> 01:44:23,991
So I mean,

4179
01:44:23,991 --> 01:44:26,720
if you can't afford this or if you
know you want to try it yourself,

4180
01:44:26,721 --> 01:44:29,570
you can always just find out what the
ingredients are and go replicate it

4181
01:44:29,571 --> 01:44:30,050
yourself.

4182
01:44:30,050 --> 01:44:34,760
But what we've done is we
put it all together into one
pill form and you take it

4183
01:44:34,761 --> 01:44:36,020
and it does something,

4184
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:38,330
I don't know exactly what
you could say it does,

4185
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,400
but it makes you feel sharper,

4186
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:42,140
release your brain fire better.

4187
01:44:42,170 --> 01:44:42,321
Oh,

4188
01:44:42,321 --> 01:44:42,980
for sure.

4189
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:46,850
It makes me feel less
tired when I have jet lag.

4190
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:47,960
When I check into hotels,

4191
01:44:47,961 --> 01:44:50,140
I take three of them as
soon as I land and I,

4192
01:44:50,141 --> 01:44:51,380
I always feel much better.

4193
01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:54,290
I feel much more relaxed when I wake up.

4194
01:44:54,770 --> 01:44:55,341
It's weird,

4195
01:44:55,341 --> 01:44:55,760
dude.

4196
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,440
My dreams are insane.

4197
01:44:57,490 --> 01:44:57,680
Wait,

4198
01:44:57,680 --> 01:44:59,540
that's why I had my Arnold
Schwarzenegger dream.

4199
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:00,633
Take this too.

4200
01:45:00,750 --> 01:45:01,480
Yeah.

4201
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:01,650
I've,

4202
01:45:01,650 --> 01:45:03,230
I don't know what revision that one is.

4203
01:45:03,231 --> 01:45:04,310
This is the newest of the newest.

4204
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:05,420
I'm on the,

4205
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:07,940
I had the first revision stuff is amazing.

4206
01:45:07,970 --> 01:45:08,870
What's it called again?

4207
01:45:09,170 --> 01:45:09,501
Well,

4208
01:45:09,501 --> 01:45:10,334
we have,

4209
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:11,840
let me see what we're
calling it right now.

4210
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:13,550
It's Alpha is calling an Alpha,

4211
01:45:13,551 --> 01:45:15,110
so it's done on it labs.

4212
01:45:15,450 --> 01:45:16,140
Oh Man.

4213
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:18,140
it.com or on it labs.

4214
01:45:18,141 --> 01:45:19,040
Is it on it labs?

4215
01:45:19,430 --> 01:45:20,840
I think it's just on it dot.

4216
01:45:20,930 --> 01:45:21,940
Maybe a hold on.

4217
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:24,590
But they also make a product
called roll on and roll off.

4218
01:45:24,620 --> 01:45:25,460
When I do shrooms,

4219
01:45:25,461 --> 01:45:27,950
I do row on before I do showrooms.

4220
01:45:27,951 --> 01:45:32,490
And then the next day it's to
balance out your neurochemistry.

4221
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:32,751
Yeah.

4222
01:45:32,751 --> 01:45:36,140
It's on at.com the balance
out your fucking brain juice.

4223
01:45:36,290 --> 01:45:36,980
Yeah.

4224
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:37,461
So,

4225
01:45:37,461 --> 01:45:38,294
um,

4226
01:45:39,370 --> 01:45:40,850
and I think we just crashed the server,

4227
01:45:41,170 --> 01:45:42,400
but did we?

4228
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:43,273
Yeah.

4229
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:44,793
Shit.

4230
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:46,391
Oh,

4231
01:45:46,391 --> 01:45:47,680
but Ashfield back to Asheville.

4232
01:45:47,890 --> 01:45:48,340
Great.

4233
01:45:48,340 --> 01:45:48,670
Uh,

4234
01:45:48,670 --> 01:45:49,150
it was just,

4235
01:45:49,150 --> 01:45:49,690
it was,

4236
01:45:49,690 --> 01:45:51,790
it's a really cool festival because it's,

4237
01:45:51,940 --> 01:45:52,450
you know,

4238
01:45:52,450 --> 01:45:55,660
it's smaller than like the
big festivals are just,

4239
01:45:55,661 --> 01:45:56,350
they're fun,

4240
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:58,330
they're really well run,

4241
01:45:58,331 --> 01:45:59,330
but they're massive.

4242
01:45:59,570 --> 01:46:00,520
They're massive,

4243
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:02,650
huge things where it's like,

4244
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:03,521
you know,

4245
01:46:03,521 --> 01:46:07,210
there's countless shows going
on and then everything is like,

4246
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:09,070
you almost lose kind of,

4247
01:46:09,490 --> 01:46:09,761
you know,

4248
01:46:09,761 --> 01:46:12,300
sense of where you are and
like where am I supposed to be?

4249
01:46:12,350 --> 01:46:12,560
Right,

4250
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:12,760
right,

4251
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:13,021
right.

4252
01:46:13,021 --> 01:46:15,380
And this is small and it's
the fifth year they did,

4253
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:17,110
he'd been to Montreal that
that's the biggest one.

4254
01:46:17,111 --> 01:46:17,620
Right.

4255
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:19,450
Well I did Melbourne a few months ago.

4256
01:46:19,970 --> 01:46:20,770
Dad Is,

4257
01:46:20,770 --> 01:46:23,470
I think so initially it's huge.

4258
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:24,190
Huge.

4259
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:27,880
I heard that a lot of the
international guys are really bad.

4260
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,200
Uh,

4261
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:29,490
ah.

4262
01:46:29,490 --> 01:46:31,840
I mean I didn't see that many shows.

4263
01:46:31,870 --> 01:46:33,160
I saw like,

4264
01:46:33,161 --> 01:46:34,150
cause I was doing shows.

4265
01:46:34,151 --> 01:46:34,721
So it was just like,

4266
01:46:34,721 --> 01:46:34,871
you know,

4267
01:46:34,871 --> 01:46:35,890
we check out some shows.

4268
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:36,701
I didn't even hear that.

4269
01:46:36,701 --> 01:46:37,570
I'm just talking shit.

4270
01:46:37,690 --> 01:46:37,871
Oh,

4271
01:46:37,871 --> 01:46:38,330
he realize

4272
01:46:38,330 --> 01:46:39,680
I want to see if he can talk some shit.

4273
01:46:42,290 --> 01:46:43,670
Try to pull you into a sheepdog,

4274
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:44,533
man.

4275
01:46:45,140 --> 01:46:47,390
I always root for people in
other countries to be hilarious.

4276
01:46:47,550 --> 01:46:47,791
I know,

4277
01:46:47,791 --> 01:46:48,840
I saw some really funny,

4278
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:50,220
I it this Irish Dude,

4279
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:50,581
fuck,

4280
01:46:50,581 --> 01:46:51,331
I forget his name,

4281
01:46:51,331 --> 01:46:54,930
who was hilarious and it didn't
put on a traditional standup show.

4282
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:56,940
It was more like a performance.

4283
01:46:58,130 --> 01:46:59,580
Like in one sense I've just,

4284
01:46:59,581 --> 01:47:00,480
that like he,

4285
01:47:00,510 --> 01:47:02,610
he brought people on stage
and he would do shit,

4286
01:47:02,611 --> 01:47:03,810
but he was just genuinely funny,

4287
01:47:03,811 --> 01:47:05,610
like a funny guy and like,

4288
01:47:05,850 --> 01:47:06,241
you know,

4289
01:47:06,241 --> 01:47:10,110
like he like music cues would
come on and he'd fucking Scottish.

4290
01:47:10,111 --> 01:47:11,610
That they have a good sense of humor.

4291
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:12,480
Great sense of humor.

4292
01:47:12,481 --> 01:47:12,780
Yeah.

4293
01:47:12,780 --> 01:47:13,830
Billy Connolly Guy,

4294
01:47:13,831 --> 01:47:15,420
he's a solid standup.

4295
01:47:15,470 --> 01:47:16,800
Australians were,

4296
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:18,990
they were all the crowds were great.

4297
01:47:18,991 --> 01:47:19,710
Everybody was great.

4298
01:47:19,710 --> 01:47:23,790
Do you ever feel like a English comics
get extra props because their accent like

4299
01:47:23,791 --> 01:47:26,040
this certain certain dudes
to get like extra credit?

4300
01:47:26,110 --> 01:47:26,760
Yeah,

4301
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:27,300
sure.

4302
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:31,230
And I also feel like they give
themselves extra credit for being clever.

4303
01:47:31,231 --> 01:47:32,100
Like they'll kind of be like,

4304
01:47:32,130 --> 01:47:32,640
hmm.

4305
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:34,500
Like you didn't get that dumb shit.

4306
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,420
Well that was fucking brilliant
thing that I just said.

4307
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:36,960
Absolutely.

4308
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:37,631
Stewart lead.

4309
01:47:37,631 --> 01:47:38,271
Do you know who he is?

4310
01:47:38,271 --> 01:47:39,104
The English guy.

4311
01:47:39,930 --> 01:47:40,860
Interesting stuff.

4312
01:47:40,910 --> 01:47:41,910
Very funny stuff.

4313
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:42,480
Yeah.

4314
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:45,780
But I always wonder like how
would that translate in America?

4315
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:50,700
Because he has this really slow style
that sort of depends on everyone paying

4316
01:47:50,701 --> 01:47:52,560
attention and everyone being polite.

4317
01:47:52,910 --> 01:47:53,400
You know,

4318
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:55,440
there's more of that in the audiences,

4319
01:47:55,441 --> 01:48:00,441
like definitely in Australia where like
at least at these festival shows where

4320
01:48:00,511 --> 01:48:03,390
you get like a very
polite listening audience.

4321
01:48:03,391 --> 01:48:05,190
Like they're very polite.

4322
01:48:05,250 --> 01:48:07,800
They're even the rowdy
people in England are polite.

4323
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:08,860
Yeah.

4324
01:48:08,860 --> 01:48:09,250
Yeah.

4325
01:48:09,250 --> 01:48:10,010
You know,

4326
01:48:10,010 --> 01:48:12,300
I've had some shows where
people yelling out crazy shit,

4327
01:48:12,301 --> 01:48:14,040
but they were polite in
how they were doing it,

4328
01:48:14,490 --> 01:48:14,960
you know?

4329
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:15,221
Yeah,

4330
01:48:15,221 --> 01:48:15,900
yeah.

4331
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:16,670
I'm doing a break.

4332
01:48:16,670 --> 01:48:17,131
Go home,

4333
01:48:17,131 --> 01:48:18,060
Yank please.

4334
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:19,193
They weren't that bad.

4335
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:20,220
No one was being mean.

4336
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:21,270
They're just yelling shit out.

4337
01:48:21,450 --> 01:48:23,850
But I'm doing Birmingham just
trying to figure out the date,

4338
01:48:23,851 --> 01:48:26,020
so I'm going to do it
with Doug Benson and uh,

4339
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:26,341
yeah,

4340
01:48:26,341 --> 01:48:27,810
it was a UFC in Birmingham.

4341
01:48:27,811 --> 01:48:28,880
So in a book,

4342
01:48:28,881 --> 01:48:30,270
something England in England.

4343
01:48:30,271 --> 01:48:30,601
Yeah.

4344
01:48:30,601 --> 01:48:31,140
November.

4345
01:48:31,140 --> 01:48:31,651
I did that.

4346
01:48:31,651 --> 01:48:33,510
I did Birmingham with Russell Peters.

4347
01:48:33,630 --> 01:48:33,931
Yeah.

4348
01:48:33,931 --> 01:48:34,820
Birmingham's awesome.

4349
01:48:34,840 --> 01:48:35,430
Yeah,

4350
01:48:35,430 --> 01:48:36,080
I did that a while.

4351
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:37,500
That was his ship.

4352
01:48:37,610 --> 01:48:38,070
Yeah.

4353
01:48:38,070 --> 01:48:42,780
For 7,500 people is to now that
was the warmup for the arena.

4354
01:48:42,870 --> 01:48:43,703
Did you do?

4355
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:45,030
Yeah.

4356
01:48:45,030 --> 01:48:45,900
Holy Shit.

4357
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:46,530
Yeah.

4358
01:48:46,530 --> 01:48:47,250
Wow.

4359
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:47,481
Yeah.

4360
01:48:47,481 --> 01:48:47,760
Yeah.

4361
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:51,990
We warmed up for 7,000 Russell Peters is
the biggest stand up comic in the world

4362
01:48:51,991 --> 01:48:53,220
and people don't even realize that.

4363
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:54,570
They don't even realize it.

4364
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:57,720
I know a lot of people that have no
idea who he is and it's crazy to me.

4365
01:48:57,721 --> 01:48:58,260
I'm like,

4366
01:48:58,260 --> 01:49:01,150
you don't know who Russell Peters is
like you've never heard that name.

4367
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:04,350
Like you go into another country
and you say that name where you go,

4368
01:49:04,410 --> 01:49:08,670
you know like put his name
on on the staples center or
whatever the fucking sell

4369
01:49:08,671 --> 01:49:10,400
out 18,000 seats,

4370
01:49:10,401 --> 01:49:11,120
we'll sell out.

4371
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:11,581
Do I think,

4372
01:49:11,581 --> 01:49:12,420
did I tell you,

4373
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:14,520
I told somebody that like,

4374
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:15,383
you know,

4375
01:49:15,450 --> 01:49:19,980
his audience was really nice
at Otu especially it was
like he's packed the o two

4376
01:49:19,981 --> 01:49:21,450
arena to tell jokes.

4377
01:49:21,470 --> 01:49:21,830
Right,

4378
01:49:21,830 --> 01:49:22,300
right.

4379
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:23,450
And you have,

4380
01:49:23,490 --> 01:49:28,190
you do it like they're like 20 minutes
and set goes well and you get laughed and

4381
01:49:28,191 --> 01:49:28,441
you're like,

4382
01:49:28,441 --> 01:49:28,981
this is amazing.

4383
01:49:28,981 --> 01:49:31,530
You finished and they give
you like a nice applaud.

4384
01:49:31,531 --> 01:49:36,300
And then you think you have a gauge
for how loud that's going to be.

4385
01:49:36,390 --> 01:49:36,781
You know what I mean?

4386
01:49:36,781 --> 01:49:40,710
Like when you're in a club and you
hit a punch on you're like wow,

4387
01:49:40,711 --> 01:49:44,310
I mean if you really kill you're like
so that's how like it can get loud and

4388
01:49:44,311 --> 01:49:45,780
like you gauge how loud that is.

4389
01:49:46,230 --> 01:49:50,530
I thought that because I had gotten
laughs during my set like well that's what

4390
01:49:50,531 --> 01:49:52,330
it'll sound like man.

4391
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:57,360
When they said they had an intro to
him coming on stage and the intro was

4392
01:49:57,641 --> 01:49:59,500
prerecorded by Michael Buffer.

4393
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:00,550
Okay.

4394
01:50:00,550 --> 01:50:04,810
The ring announcer who and he does
like let's get like a whole buildup.

4395
01:50:05,410 --> 01:50:07,720
That place fucking exploded.

4396
01:50:07,870 --> 01:50:11,890
Like they were like the Beatles are alive
and they're here and like you guys are

4397
01:50:11,891 --> 01:50:16,780
going to see them for one show only
screaming that made all the hair on your

4398
01:50:16,930 --> 01:50:17,770
neck stand up,

4399
01:50:17,771 --> 01:50:18,910
goosebumps and you're like,

4400
01:50:19,210 --> 01:50:21,400
like you crouch cause the
noise is overwhelming.

4401
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:22,030
It was that.

4402
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:26,280
It was like they said Buck and
Jesus has walked into the building.

4403
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,830
I'm going to ask Bruce Buffer to
introduce me on my next special,

4404
01:50:28,860 --> 01:50:29,693
how tight is that?

4405
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:33,110
I feel like I've got to have Joey Diaz
do it because Joey Diaz has done everyone

4406
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:37,230
that I've ever done everything that I've
ever done except for my Houston spa,

4407
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:39,360
a CD that I recorded in 99.

4408
01:50:39,361 --> 01:50:40,710
Joey Diaz has introduced me to,

4409
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:42,780
it doesn't get much better than that.

4410
01:50:42,870 --> 01:50:45,330
I bypass the comedy works in Denver.

4411
01:50:45,331 --> 01:50:45,980
I love you,

4412
01:50:45,980 --> 01:50:46,830
but you won't put,

4413
01:50:46,831 --> 01:50:48,210
Joey d is on the menu.

4414
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:49,830
So I'm doing the,

4415
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:51,750
I'm doing a theater and uh,

4416
01:50:51,870 --> 01:50:52,703
what am I doing?

4417
01:50:53,110 --> 01:50:54,240
Don't just put it up today.

4418
01:50:54,241 --> 01:50:55,830
It's on your website and Twitter.

4419
01:50:56,190 --> 01:50:57,930
It's non Ustream son.

4420
01:50:58,740 --> 01:50:59,573
It's um,

4421
01:50:59,910 --> 01:51:01,420
we're doing a theater in um,

4422
01:51:02,610 --> 01:51:03,030
uh,

4423
01:51:03,030 --> 01:51:03,361
Denver,

4424
01:51:03,361 --> 01:51:03,781
Colorado.

4425
01:51:03,781 --> 01:51:05,040
The paramount theater night.

4426
01:51:05,590 --> 01:51:06,840
Joey Diaz can finally do it.

4427
01:51:06,990 --> 01:51:08,370
Every time I've gone to,

4428
01:51:08,371 --> 01:51:09,204
uh,

4429
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:10,500
to the comedy works in Denver.

4430
01:51:10,501 --> 01:51:12,060
Joey can't work the comedy works.

4431
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:15,000
You had some sort of a disagreement
with somebody back in the day?

4432
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:16,373
Fortunately,

4433
01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:20,280
so I hit my weed at the comedy works.

4434
01:51:21,350 --> 01:51:21,690
Okay.

4435
01:51:21,690 --> 01:51:23,130
Can we go back two minutes?

4436
01:51:23,190 --> 01:51:23,371
Yeah,

4437
01:51:23,371 --> 01:51:24,061
we can do a set,

4438
01:51:24,061 --> 01:51:25,860
maybe a late night set Saturday night.

4439
01:51:25,861 --> 01:51:26,401
That's possible.

4440
01:51:26,401 --> 01:51:27,240
I'll be there in a couple of weeks.

4441
01:51:27,241 --> 01:51:27,810
I'll grab before.

4442
01:51:27,810 --> 01:51:27,970
No,

4443
01:51:27,970 --> 01:51:29,160
I won't be at the club.

4444
01:51:29,161 --> 01:51:30,180
I'll be in a different club,

4445
01:51:30,181 --> 01:51:31,290
will be at the Denver Improv,

4446
01:51:31,291 --> 01:51:31,680
but I'll,

4447
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:35,580
I'll go over there and grab you find
that ones going to the comedy works 23.

4448
01:51:35,581 --> 01:51:36,510
Denver comedy works.

4449
01:51:36,511 --> 01:51:37,980
We could find out who's
there and if they're cool,

4450
01:51:37,981 --> 01:51:38,720
we can hang with them.

4451
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:38,980
Yeah,

4452
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:39,481
that'd be cool.

4453
01:51:39,481 --> 01:51:40,590
We can find you guys go,

4454
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:42,150
uh,

4455
01:51:42,180 --> 01:51:45,210
the Denver one is going to be in,

4456
01:51:45,230 --> 01:51:46,063
uh,

4457
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:48,600
September 23rd.

4458
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:49,200
Okay.

4459
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:51,210
Should we fund Denver is fucking awesome,

4460
01:51:51,211 --> 01:51:52,630
but I'm going to get you in a [inaudible].

4461
01:51:53,250 --> 01:51:54,320
I'm going to want to move there again.

4462
01:51:54,321 --> 01:51:55,680
Then I'm gonna start getting apocalyptic.

4463
01:51:56,370 --> 01:51:59,910
Fucking worry about stocking up
on water and shit and hunting elk.

4464
01:52:00,660 --> 01:52:01,281
That's what happens.

4465
01:52:01,281 --> 01:52:02,460
But that was a crazy place.

4466
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:03,300
I saw your place.

4467
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:03,711
I'll get a little,

4468
01:52:03,711 --> 01:52:03,871
yeah,

4469
01:52:03,871 --> 01:52:04,710
you went up there with me.

4470
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:05,371
That was crazy,

4471
01:52:05,371 --> 01:52:05,640
man.

4472
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:05,921
Did you,

4473
01:52:05,921 --> 01:52:07,470
would you just think I was
crazy for moving there?

4474
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:07,940
No.

4475
01:52:07,940 --> 01:52:09,330
What did you think when
you went up there though?

4476
01:52:09,331 --> 01:52:10,500
It had to be a weird,

4477
01:52:10,820 --> 01:52:11,011
I mean,

4478
01:52:11,011 --> 01:52:11,521
when someone says,

4479
01:52:11,521 --> 01:52:11,880
Hey,

4480
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:12,271
I'm on,

4481
01:52:12,271 --> 01:52:13,920
I'm gonna take you on a ride
to the top of a mountain,

4482
01:52:13,921 --> 01:52:14,750
down a dirt road,

4483
01:52:14,750 --> 01:52:15,111
the square,

4484
01:52:15,111 --> 01:52:16,830
I'm going to sleep with my kids at night.

4485
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:18,030
I thought like,

4486
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:19,500
my real reaction was,

4487
01:52:19,501 --> 01:52:20,334
this is awesome.

4488
01:52:20,370 --> 01:52:22,470
I wish I was in a position that
I could do something like this.

4489
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:23,333
That was my genuine,

4490
01:52:23,610 --> 01:52:24,540
I didn't see it as like,

4491
01:52:24,541 --> 01:52:25,410
what the fuck is he doing?

4492
01:52:25,420 --> 01:52:26,220
I was like,

4493
01:52:26,220 --> 01:52:26,551
Oh man,

4494
01:52:26,551 --> 01:52:28,440
I wish I could fucking do this too.

4495
01:52:28,530 --> 01:52:29,580
That was honestly how I felt.

4496
01:52:29,790 --> 01:52:30,810
There's two types of people.

4497
01:52:30,811 --> 01:52:33,190
There's people that thought that way
like me and then there's people thought

4498
01:52:33,210 --> 01:52:33,301
like,

4499
01:52:33,301 --> 01:52:34,480
what the fuck going on?

4500
01:52:34,540 --> 01:52:35,700
It was really cool.

4501
01:52:35,790 --> 01:52:39,330
But once I'm also like kind of antisocial,

4502
01:52:39,390 --> 01:52:40,760
like personally and like I'm,

4503
01:52:40,761 --> 01:52:40,920
I'm,

4504
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:41,610
I'm,

4505
01:52:41,610 --> 01:52:44,380
I like speak kind of
isolation and privacy.

4506
01:52:44,410 --> 01:52:44,561
Yeah,

4507
01:52:44,561 --> 01:52:44,740
yeah,

4508
01:52:44,740 --> 01:52:45,080
yeah,

4509
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:45,380
totally.

4510
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:45,591
Well,

4511
01:52:45,591 --> 01:52:48,170
I think the move is you got to have bowls,

4512
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:48,711
you know,

4513
01:52:48,711 --> 01:52:51,710
and I think with one of the reasons
why a guy like you are a guy,

4514
01:52:51,711 --> 01:52:56,711
like I might want to have some peace and
quiet alone is because performing can

4515
01:52:56,841 --> 01:52:58,430
be kind of overwhelming sometimes.

4516
01:52:58,580 --> 01:52:59,060
Yeah.

4517
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:03,560
I think in front of giant groups of
people requires this intense amount of

4518
01:53:03,561 --> 01:53:06,110
energy and concentration
and then you know,

4519
01:53:06,130 --> 01:53:06,341
then,

4520
01:53:06,341 --> 01:53:08,180
then there's also like meet and greets,

4521
01:53:08,181 --> 01:53:08,451
you know,

4522
01:53:08,451 --> 01:53:09,770
after shows where it's like,

4523
01:53:09,970 --> 01:53:10,250
you know,

4524
01:53:10,250 --> 01:53:11,630
I want to say hi to everybody I want to,

4525
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:13,250
but then I want it.

4526
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:14,000
Nothing.

4527
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:14,300
Yeah.

4528
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:18,590
I want complete quiet and I like
just to sit on a fucking tree,

4529
01:53:18,890 --> 01:53:19,191
you know,

4530
01:53:19,191 --> 01:53:22,490
a fallen tree and look over at
a lake and fucking go fishing.

4531
01:53:22,610 --> 01:53:23,010
I love it.

4532
01:53:23,010 --> 01:53:23,271
I want to,

4533
01:53:23,271 --> 01:53:24,530
I don't want to hear shit man.

4534
01:53:24,770 --> 01:53:27,710
I don't want to answer questions about
when is Anderson Silva going to fight

4535
01:53:27,711 --> 01:53:31,430
fucking this guy because I don't want
to hear shit dude by just to watch the

4536
01:53:31,431 --> 01:53:32,264
water ripple.

4537
01:53:32,930 --> 01:53:33,470
I want Nate,

4538
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:37,880
I want to recharge of my wife
because my wife's a comic too.

4539
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:42,950
Like we turn down social invitations
almost a hundred percent of the time

4540
01:53:43,230 --> 01:53:44,063
because we both,

4541
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:45,860
we both perform and we get home.

4542
01:53:45,861 --> 01:53:46,250
We're like,

4543
01:53:46,250 --> 01:53:47,083
this is awesome.

4544
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:48,350
We're just going to sit here on the couch.

4545
01:53:48,650 --> 01:53:49,340
This is great.

4546
01:53:49,340 --> 01:53:49,650
Yeah.

4547
01:53:49,650 --> 01:53:50,420
Then the people are like,

4548
01:53:50,420 --> 01:53:50,541
no,

4549
01:53:50,541 --> 01:53:51,960
but this thing is going to
be awesome and we're like,

4550
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:52,160
yeah,

4551
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:52,830
but I don't want to go.

4552
01:53:52,830 --> 01:53:52,950
Yeah,

4553
01:53:52,950 --> 01:53:53,783
I'm the same way.

4554
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:58,460
Same Way that your house got reminded
me of something you'd see on a trapper

4555
01:53:58,461 --> 01:53:58,970
keeper.

4556
01:53:58,970 --> 01:54:01,310
Like I remember how amazing it the photos,

4557
01:54:01,311 --> 01:54:02,180
I never got to see it,

4558
01:54:02,181 --> 01:54:03,230
but the photos you singing,

4559
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:03,480
I was like,

4560
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:04,460
Jesus Dude,

4561
01:54:04,461 --> 01:54:06,910
his place was amazing as a trip dude.

4562
01:54:06,920 --> 01:54:07,730
It was amazing.

4563
01:54:07,730 --> 01:54:12,730
The view was incredible back there was
that walk that we went on and that lady

4564
01:54:13,451 --> 01:54:16,280
that she was such a cool
lady that owned the place.

4565
01:54:16,550 --> 01:54:17,510
I really liked that lady.

4566
01:54:17,511 --> 01:54:20,990
She was awesome and she was
really super yoga into yoga.

4567
01:54:20,991 --> 01:54:21,860
It's swimming and she was like,

4568
01:54:21,861 --> 01:54:25,550
here I stand in like the sun hit it and
she had like a wooden thing and she was

4569
01:54:25,551 --> 01:54:25,671
like,

4570
01:54:25,671 --> 01:54:26,504
I just said,

4571
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:27,050
you know,

4572
01:54:27,050 --> 01:54:28,100
you have to give thanks.

4573
01:54:28,101 --> 01:54:28,611
Give thanks.

4574
01:54:28,611 --> 01:54:31,220
But like I wasn't all into
necessarily doing that,

4575
01:54:31,221 --> 01:54:33,860
but I love like being
able to walk out there,

4576
01:54:34,430 --> 01:54:35,900
staying on the side of a mountain.

4577
01:54:35,990 --> 01:54:36,620
It's awesome.

4578
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:38,840
And you just didn't like it
says a man leaves and uh,

4579
01:54:39,650 --> 01:54:40,281
that's a,

4580
01:54:40,281 --> 01:54:42,020
that's where people are supposed to be.

4581
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:43,910
You're supposed to at some point in time,

4582
01:54:43,911 --> 01:54:47,720
be there and relax and kind of look at
it and reset your perspective when you

4583
01:54:47,721 --> 01:54:48,860
enter into the hive again.

4584
01:54:49,060 --> 01:54:49,281
Yeah.

4585
01:54:49,281 --> 01:54:50,240
When you were in the hive,

4586
01:54:50,241 --> 01:54:51,530
like we're in the high right now,

4587
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:51,981
you know,

4588
01:54:51,981 --> 01:54:52,190
there's,

4589
01:54:52,190 --> 01:54:52,971
even though we're,

4590
01:54:52,971 --> 01:54:55,730
we're kind of relaxed up here and
it's kind of quiet where I live,

4591
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:58,340
there's still millions
of people in this area.

4592
01:54:58,490 --> 01:55:00,590
There's whether or not you realize it,

4593
01:55:00,591 --> 01:55:02,270
you're feeling that you know,

4594
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:02,541
you're,

4595
01:55:02,541 --> 01:55:04,210
you're hearing cars move your,

4596
01:55:04,710 --> 01:55:07,400
that has an impact on
your breathing it well,

4597
01:55:07,401 --> 01:55:07,641
yeah,

4598
01:55:07,641 --> 01:55:08,780
you're breathing it for sure.

4599
01:55:08,781 --> 01:55:09,770
That has a big impact.

4600
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:12,950
And one of the things that I learned
from that fucking isolation tank is that

4601
01:55:12,951 --> 01:55:15,280
the more you can remove the,

4602
01:55:15,330 --> 01:55:20,330
the more you can see things clear and
removing things and distractions and bad

4603
01:55:21,651 --> 01:55:22,700
things from your environment.

4604
01:55:23,030 --> 01:55:25,700
When you have all these things in your
environment and they're just there all

4605
01:55:25,701 --> 01:55:26,151
the time,

4606
01:55:26,151 --> 01:55:28,070
you don't ever think of removing them.

4607
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:29,480
People who live in New York City,

4608
01:55:29,481 --> 01:55:29,991
they love it.

4609
01:55:29,991 --> 01:55:30,860
I love the action.

4610
01:55:30,861 --> 01:55:31,671
I love the sound.

4611
01:55:31,671 --> 01:55:32,301
I love this city.

4612
01:55:32,301 --> 01:55:33,230
It's amazing city.

4613
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:36,680
You don't realize that city is
bombarding you with sensory input,

4614
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:40,340
bombarding you with information that
you have to process all the time.

4615
01:55:40,470 --> 01:55:43,010
And some people enjoy that
and it actually keeps them,

4616
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:44,513
but

4617
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:45,050
two,

4618
01:55:45,050 --> 01:55:49,830
to really get a fresh sense of
who you are and what life is.

4619
01:55:49,831 --> 01:55:52,560
And you just just look
at it at a one degree,

4620
01:55:52,561 --> 01:55:53,550
different angle.

4621
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:54,600
Just get to the woods,

4622
01:55:54,601 --> 01:55:55,290
man,

4623
01:55:55,290 --> 01:55:56,280
get to the shore,

4624
01:55:56,430 --> 01:55:57,660
could walk along the ocean,

4625
01:55:57,661 --> 01:55:58,530
stare out at that.

4626
01:55:58,531 --> 01:55:59,880
Never ending water.

4627
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:00,750
There's put,

4628
01:56:00,750 --> 01:56:04,710
you need some form of visible
nature to humble yourself,

4629
01:56:05,370 --> 01:56:05,761
you know?

4630
01:56:05,761 --> 01:56:06,481
And in California,

4631
01:56:06,481 --> 01:56:08,520
that's one of the reasons why
people are such fucking twats.

4632
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:09,151
There's no,

4633
01:56:09,151 --> 01:56:10,920
whether you have to deal with ever.

4634
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:12,930
It's just beautiful out here all the time.

4635
01:56:12,931 --> 01:56:13,471
It's sunny.

4636
01:56:13,471 --> 01:56:14,790
It fucking hardly ever rains.

4637
01:56:14,910 --> 01:56:15,391
When it does,

4638
01:56:15,391 --> 01:56:16,410
it rains for a day,

4639
01:56:16,530 --> 01:56:16,771
you know,

4640
01:56:16,771 --> 01:56:18,150
it might rain 10 days a year,

4641
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:18,511
you know?

4642
01:56:18,511 --> 01:56:18,721
I mean,

4643
01:56:18,721 --> 01:56:19,470
what's the,

4644
01:56:19,470 --> 01:56:23,580
what's the most 2020 out of 365 it
doesn't fucking rain very often,

4645
01:56:23,581 --> 01:56:23,920
man.

4646
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:25,260
We don't have to deal with wind.

4647
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:26,520
We don't have to deal with shit.

4648
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:28,080
Occasionally something lights on fire,

4649
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:32,430
but that's why people are such cons out
here because you need nature in your

4650
01:56:32,431 --> 01:56:33,120
face.

4651
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:34,860
You need a thunderstorm man.

4652
01:56:34,861 --> 01:56:37,860
You need something like that to
really like put it in perspective.

4653
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:38,400
Sure.

4654
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:38,641
Man,

4655
01:56:38,641 --> 01:56:41,670
I need to be a little more
humble about my position here.

4656
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:42,451
Okay.

4657
01:56:42,451 --> 01:56:47,451
I'm just a little tiny little organism
clean to this giant things hurling

4658
01:56:47,821 --> 01:56:48,654
through the galaxy,

4659
01:56:49,170 --> 01:56:49,411
you know?

4660
01:56:49,411 --> 01:56:51,230
And the best way in my opinion to,

4661
01:56:51,410 --> 01:56:54,120
to feel that is to be somewhere natural.

4662
01:56:54,121 --> 01:56:58,230
Just interact with the earth somewhere
where you could see a fucking forest

4663
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:02,730
somewhere where you could see the ocean
and seal fucking water that goes on as

4664
01:57:02,731 --> 01:57:03,990
far as you can see.

4665
01:57:03,991 --> 01:57:06,930
It's water and it's deep as fuck.

4666
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:11,070
And all that has to do is the earth moves
in a wave on a hundred feet high comes

4667
01:57:11,071 --> 01:57:13,110
flying at you at 50 miles an hour.

4668
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:14,240
Fucking Jack Too.

4669
01:57:14,730 --> 01:57:15,081
You know,

4670
01:57:15,081 --> 01:57:15,310
it's,

4671
01:57:15,310 --> 01:57:15,800
it's,

4672
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:16,940
it changes the way you feel.

4673
01:57:16,970 --> 01:57:18,040
Fuck yeah it does.

4674
01:57:18,110 --> 01:57:18,591
I did a,

4675
01:57:18,591 --> 01:57:19,520
I went to Sun Valley,

4676
01:57:19,521 --> 01:57:21,170
Idaho this winter.

4677
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:22,610
That was amazing man.

4678
01:57:22,700 --> 01:57:22,971
Oh yeah,

4679
01:57:22,971 --> 01:57:23,571
that's gorgeous.

4680
01:57:23,571 --> 01:57:24,380
My God,

4681
01:57:24,380 --> 01:57:25,310
that like that.

4682
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:27,430
Like you literally angry
up there with the legs,

4683
01:57:27,431 --> 01:57:28,910
like quarter lane and all that.

4684
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:29,660
And then there's,

4685
01:57:29,660 --> 01:57:29,961
there's,

4686
01:57:29,961 --> 01:57:32,150
there's these beautiful
mountains covered with snow.

4687
01:57:32,151 --> 01:57:34,220
Then there's huge trees and you're just,

4688
01:57:34,250 --> 01:57:34,730
you go,

4689
01:57:34,730 --> 01:57:35,331
Holy Shit.

4690
01:57:35,331 --> 01:57:35,511
Yeah.

4691
01:57:35,511 --> 01:57:36,380
Just everything is just like,

4692
01:57:36,970 --> 01:57:37,803
yeah,

4693
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:42,860
you're fucking whole physical being like
tunes into it and then you relax more.

4694
01:57:43,370 --> 01:57:44,270
I wish I could have a house here.

4695
01:57:44,430 --> 01:57:46,610
That's the next thought you
have fucking out of here.

4696
01:57:46,700 --> 01:57:46,851
Yeah.

4697
01:57:46,851 --> 01:57:49,910
We have some friends that
keep us summer house on,

4698
01:57:49,911 --> 01:57:50,211
on the,

4699
01:57:50,211 --> 01:57:53,180
on the lake out there and they're always
talking about how amazing and they're

4700
01:57:53,181 --> 01:57:54,380
in the clothing business.

4701
01:57:54,381 --> 01:57:55,250
So they were like real,

4702
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:55,731
you know,

4703
01:57:55,731 --> 01:57:56,690
hustle bustle,

4704
01:57:56,700 --> 01:57:57,420
real,

4705
01:57:57,420 --> 01:57:57,740
real,

4706
01:57:57,740 --> 01:57:59,210
always constantly on the go.

4707
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:01,860
And then they go there and just imagine,

4708
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:02,620
decompressing,

4709
01:58:02,620 --> 01:58:06,950
imagine doing like a crazy tour where
you just do like 60 cities and then you'd

4710
01:58:06,951 --> 01:58:07,311
get down,

4711
01:58:07,311 --> 01:58:07,670
you're like,

4712
01:58:07,670 --> 01:58:07,731
oh,

4713
01:58:07,731 --> 01:58:08,840
I want to go sit on the lake.

4714
01:58:08,870 --> 01:58:09,920
The husband's done.

4715
01:58:09,921 --> 01:58:10,970
He wants to move up there.

4716
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:11,301
He was like,

4717
01:58:11,301 --> 01:58:12,710
fuck this fucking crazy town.

4718
01:58:12,711 --> 01:58:13,670
And he wants to move up there.

4719
01:58:13,730 --> 01:58:14,180
Yeah,

4720
01:58:14,180 --> 01:58:14,780
yeah,

4721
01:58:14,780 --> 01:58:14,931
yeah.

4722
01:58:14,931 --> 01:58:16,250
But they have this giant business,

4723
01:58:16,290 --> 01:58:18,920
they make like shitloads
of money selling clothes.

4724
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:19,461
So they,

4725
01:58:19,461 --> 01:58:21,410
they really can't just abandon everything.

4726
01:58:21,411 --> 01:58:23,210
They have like a high
lifestyle to support,

4727
01:58:23,530 --> 01:58:23,840
you know.

4728
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:26,210
But meanwhile they just want
to just relax by the water.

4729
01:58:26,211 --> 01:58:27,044
Man.

4730
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:29,170
Everybody wants that fucking feeling of,

4731
01:58:29,420 --> 01:58:30,890
of real retiring somewhere.

4732
01:58:31,010 --> 01:58:35,390
But you don't realize that that is
very close to death kind of based.

4733
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:39,170
At least a lot of people have
who they are on what they do,

4734
01:58:39,290 --> 01:58:40,400
what they do for a living,

4735
01:58:40,401 --> 01:58:42,130
what they do for how
they interact with people

4736
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:42,963
and feel useful.

4737
01:58:43,180 --> 01:58:46,120
And as soon as you like slide away
from that and just stay by yourself,

4738
01:58:46,370 --> 01:58:47,141
it takes a very,

4739
01:58:47,141 --> 01:58:47,690
uh,

4740
01:58:47,690 --> 01:58:51,370
a very different mindset to enjoy that
without starting to get depressed and

4741
01:58:51,371 --> 01:58:53,770
start feeling that you're dying and
it's the end of the line for you,

4742
01:58:53,950 --> 01:58:54,550
you know?

4743
01:58:54,550 --> 01:58:55,180
Yeah.

4744
01:58:55,180 --> 01:58:55,421
Yeah.

4745
01:58:55,421 --> 01:58:56,254
Cause that is,

4746
01:58:56,260 --> 01:58:58,450
it really is putting the brakes
on when you move somewhere.

4747
01:58:58,480 --> 01:58:58,721
Right.

4748
01:58:58,721 --> 01:58:59,300
Cause you,

4749
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:00,130
but maybe it's your,

4750
01:59:00,130 --> 01:59:02,260
you're opening up to
something else because you're,

4751
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:06,190
instead of like your drive being
for accomplishing more work,

4752
01:59:06,191 --> 01:59:08,770
like maybe you're just becoming
a different type of person.

4753
01:59:09,030 --> 01:59:09,340
Yeah.

4754
01:59:09,340 --> 01:59:10,510
Still doing some type of work.

4755
01:59:10,511 --> 01:59:11,060
I'm saying,

4756
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:11,540
yeah,

4757
01:59:11,540 --> 01:59:12,970
you're putting work into yourself more.

4758
01:59:13,090 --> 01:59:13,271
Well,

4759
01:59:13,271 --> 01:59:16,360
if you could figure out how to a hunter
s Thompson it and how to just live up

4760
01:59:16,361 --> 01:59:19,960
there and then in travel in whenever
you wanted and then interact with the

4761
01:59:19,961 --> 01:59:21,700
people and then head
back out to your shelter.

4762
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:22,593
Where would he live?

4763
01:59:22,610 --> 01:59:25,240
He lived in a woody creek in Colorado.

4764
01:59:25,270 --> 01:59:26,950
Colorado is a near Aspen,

4765
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:32,260
really more remote even sort of than I
was living because aspen is trickier to

4766
01:59:32,261 --> 01:59:33,094
get to,

4767
01:59:33,130 --> 01:59:33,580
you know,

4768
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:34,840
you fly right into Denver,

4769
01:59:34,841 --> 01:59:36,220
you drive an hour and you're in Boulder,

4770
01:59:36,221 --> 01:59:37,840
you drive 20 minutes or in the mountains.

4771
01:59:37,900 --> 01:59:39,160
I mean it's that this is that easy.

4772
01:59:39,161 --> 01:59:43,150
It's literally you're an hour and 20
minutes from your car to a where I lived.

4773
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:44,350
That's not hard at all.

4774
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:44,771
You know,

4775
01:59:44,771 --> 01:59:46,570
and you're in the fucking woods.

4776
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:49,330
Where he was is a lot more difficult.

4777
01:59:49,331 --> 01:59:54,010
He had to fly in to aspen and aspen is
like a little tiny ass airplane airport

4778
01:59:54,011 --> 01:59:54,251
rather.

4779
01:59:54,251 --> 01:59:54,851
And it doesn't,

4780
01:59:54,851 --> 01:59:55,390
um,

4781
01:59:55,390 --> 01:59:56,410
it's not a good one either.

4782
01:59:56,411 --> 01:59:59,610
It's a funky one cause it's like nestled
in between mountains and sometimes

4783
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:00,520
people crash.

4784
02:00:01,030 --> 02:00:02,890
Like I knew they reroute
you all the time too.

4785
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:03,610
Yeah,

4786
02:00:03,610 --> 02:00:05,860
they rerouted us when we did
the Aspen comedy festival.

4787
02:00:06,190 --> 02:00:09,160
They said the winds are too high and
there's too much snow and we don't want to

4788
02:00:09,161 --> 02:00:11,080
slam into a fucking
mountain that we can't see.

4789
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:12,400
They didn't have to worry about that.

4790
02:00:12,430 --> 02:00:14,320
They did the Christina this
year when she went there.

4791
02:00:15,730 --> 02:00:17,290
I did that for Sun Valley
and they were like,

4792
02:00:17,580 --> 02:00:18,420
airports not working.

4793
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:19,150
Yeah.

4794
02:00:19,150 --> 02:00:19,960
Fuck,

4795
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:23,170
get on the bus and enjoy the
wing gets wacky up there man.

4796
02:00:23,890 --> 02:00:25,390
I knew a dude who lost his friends.

4797
02:00:25,391 --> 02:00:27,940
They were in a private jet and
they were headed out to aspen.

4798
02:00:28,270 --> 02:00:30,430
There were high rollers
in the movie business.

4799
02:00:30,580 --> 02:00:30,850
Dan.

4800
02:00:30,850 --> 02:00:34,720
These guys were like super ballers and
they fucking were making millions and

4801
02:00:34,990 --> 02:00:39,880
slammed into a mountains that you had
that like if you were to get like that,

4802
02:00:39,900 --> 02:00:42,190
it seems like the worst thing
is crashing in a private jet.

4803
02:00:42,190 --> 02:00:44,440
Like we were like let's do the
fucking private jet shit man.

4804
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:45,460
You just,

4805
02:00:45,460 --> 02:00:47,170
you putting up crazy money.

4806
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:50,980
That's how a lot of luxury and then
you're fucking private jet crashes.

4807
02:00:50,981 --> 02:00:54,730
He's like I paid 60 grand for this
flight and it crashed into the fucking

4808
02:00:54,731 --> 02:00:55,370
mountain.

4809
02:00:55,370 --> 02:00:56,020
It's yeah,

4810
02:00:56,020 --> 02:00:59,830
private jet is the ultimate ridiculous
indulgence is like what does it cost to

4811
02:00:59,831 --> 02:01:04,330
fly to Vegas costs like if you want to
go first class is like 1000 bucks or 2000

4812
02:01:04,331 --> 02:01:07,750
bucks a month I would think more than
the thousand cause it's a pretty short

4813
02:01:07,751 --> 02:01:07,950
flight.

4814
02:01:07,950 --> 02:01:09,940
The most expensive that you can pay for.

4815
02:01:10,060 --> 02:01:11,620
And if you wanted to go coach,

4816
02:01:11,621 --> 02:01:12,610
it's like a couple hundred bucks,

4817
02:01:12,611 --> 02:01:13,240
right?

4818
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:16,290
You can go southwest for like
150 bucks or something crazy.

4819
02:01:16,630 --> 02:01:21,630
Or You could spend 15,000
and go in a private jet.

4820
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:22,450
Yeah.

4821
02:01:22,450 --> 02:01:23,110
Whoa.

4822
02:01:23,110 --> 02:01:24,160
And then there's all the,

4823
02:01:24,190 --> 02:01:25,120
there's all the qualified,

4824
02:01:25,170 --> 02:01:25,460
like the,

4825
02:01:25,460 --> 02:01:27,280
all the different classifications of jet.

4826
02:01:27,310 --> 02:01:27,701
Yeah,

4827
02:01:27,701 --> 02:01:28,534
small jet,

4828
02:01:28,850 --> 02:01:29,800
midsize jet.

4829
02:01:29,830 --> 02:01:30,990
How about propeller planes?

4830
02:01:30,991 --> 02:01:32,020
Propeller planes,

4831
02:01:32,021 --> 02:01:37,021
really luxurious propeller Bryan's we've
got you live like you're fucking Ernest

4832
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:38,290
Hemingway flying to Cuba.

4833
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:40,240
And

4834
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:40,750
the,

4835
02:01:40,750 --> 02:01:44,120
the ultimate craziest status
is like what Oprah has,

4836
02:01:44,121 --> 02:01:47,330
which is a bone in your
line of Boeing business jet.

4837
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:49,670
So it's actually a converted like seven,

4838
02:01:49,671 --> 02:01:49,941
four,

4839
02:01:49,941 --> 02:01:51,470
seven or seven seven seven.

4840
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:52,150
Is that what she had?

4841
02:01:52,150 --> 02:01:52,490
Yeah.

4842
02:01:52,490 --> 02:01:54,350
Where they strip out the entire,

4843
02:01:54,720 --> 02:01:58,330
the 60 rose and they
have like Air Force One.

4844
02:01:58,331 --> 02:02:00,960
So like entertainment area of Judge Room.

4845
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:02,721
Joe,

4846
02:02:02,721 --> 02:02:06,020
have you ever been to the Ronald
Reagan Museum up in Calabasas?

4847
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:06,740
No.

4848
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:07,573
Never been there.

4849
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:10,040
Go there and get really baked and
go to the Ronald Reagan Museum.

4850
02:02:10,041 --> 02:02:11,270
They have an air force one there.

4851
02:02:11,271 --> 02:02:12,380
And it's so amazing.

4852
02:02:12,381 --> 02:02:13,430
I'm like walking through this,

4853
02:02:13,431 --> 02:02:14,460
what you're used to.

4854
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:17,720
It's like in Calabasas thousand
oaks or somewhere around there.

4855
02:02:17,721 --> 02:02:18,500
Somewhere around there.

4856
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:19,333
Yeah,

4857
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:20,150
north.

4858
02:02:20,150 --> 02:02:20,661
Is it,

4859
02:02:20,661 --> 02:02:21,260
um,

4860
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:23,300
they actually have a plane
that you can step into.

4861
02:02:23,310 --> 02:02:23,820
Like it's outside.

4862
02:02:23,820 --> 02:02:23,971
Yeah.

4863
02:02:23,971 --> 02:02:24,141
Yeah.

4864
02:02:24,141 --> 02:02:25,070
It's a real air force one.

4865
02:02:25,080 --> 02:02:27,830
You go into the side of warehouse and
you get to walk through the whole thing

4866
02:02:27,831 --> 02:02:28,220
and they,

4867
02:02:28,220 --> 02:02:29,053
they put like little,

4868
02:02:29,210 --> 02:02:33,560
it was Ronald Reagan's and they put
like a little jelly beans on his desk

4869
02:02:33,590 --> 02:02:38,300
because he liked jelly beans but doesn't
have a one of those little escape pods.

4870
02:02:38,540 --> 02:02:41,060
And we would climb in it and then
they hit the parachute and he fucking,

4871
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:43,190
the plane falls apart and he escapes.

4872
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:43,791
I can't remember,

4873
02:02:43,791 --> 02:02:44,624
but it was pimp,

4874
02:02:45,150 --> 02:02:46,040
pimp the what?

4875
02:02:46,041 --> 02:02:46,550
I'm sorry.

4876
02:02:46,550 --> 02:02:48,690
You weren't even paying
and I was reading wasn't,

4877
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:50,290
I was reading the,

4878
02:02:50,300 --> 02:02:51,070
the uh,

4879
02:02:51,070 --> 02:02:51,891
did they have like,

4880
02:02:51,891 --> 02:02:54,170
remember how like I know
at least in some movies,

4881
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:56,210
Air Force One had like an escape pod,

4882
02:02:56,211 --> 02:03:00,830
the president Pi and it would like hell
parachute would deploy or I don't think

4883
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:02,540
this Jet Star Wars.

4884
02:03:02,550 --> 02:03:02,870
Yeah.

4885
02:03:02,870 --> 02:03:03,590
Bullshit.

4886
02:03:03,590 --> 02:03:04,490
I think that's bullshit.

4887
02:03:04,491 --> 02:03:05,510
So if the plane crashes,

4888
02:03:05,511 --> 02:03:06,344
he's fucked.

4889
02:03:06,710 --> 02:03:07,840
They can't save the president.

4890
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:08,630
The uh,

4891
02:03:08,630 --> 02:03:09,381
the seven,

4892
02:03:09,381 --> 02:03:09,621
eight,

4893
02:03:09,621 --> 02:03:09,981
seven,

4894
02:03:09,981 --> 02:03:11,030
I believe would get mad.

4895
02:03:11,450 --> 02:03:11,721
They'd go,

4896
02:03:11,721 --> 02:03:12,710
what can you save the President?

4897
02:03:12,711 --> 02:03:13,730
You can't say my little Billy.

4898
02:03:13,790 --> 02:03:16,580
I always wondered why they
couldn't have fucking parachute.

4899
02:03:16,590 --> 02:03:19,010
That's a last resort
somewhere on the plane,

4900
02:03:19,011 --> 02:03:19,930
just in case there's the whole,

4901
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:21,070
Johnny B said it best.

4902
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:21,500
He goes,

4903
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:24,500
why can't they have a power shoot
for the whole fucking place?

4904
02:03:25,580 --> 02:03:26,031
That's what he said.

4905
02:03:26,031 --> 02:03:27,620
It ties this bro.

4906
02:03:27,890 --> 02:03:28,520
This bro,

4907
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:30,260
I can fucking solve a airplane crashes.

4908
02:03:30,261 --> 02:03:30,830
What happens?

4909
02:03:30,830 --> 02:03:31,760
Playing breaks and sky.

4910
02:03:31,790 --> 02:03:32,000
Oh,

4911
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:32,900
you've got a parachute.

4912
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:34,490
He used to just drift to the ground.

4913
02:03:35,540 --> 02:03:36,373
What can they do that?

4914
02:03:36,530 --> 02:03:37,100
Yeah,

4915
02:03:37,100 --> 02:03:37,520
he goes,

4916
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:37,791
he goes,

4917
02:03:37,791 --> 02:03:38,301
what does it cost?

4918
02:03:38,301 --> 02:03:39,710
How much is it fucking parachute?

4919
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:41,030
You cheap pricks.

4920
02:03:41,270 --> 02:03:44,480
You can't even afford a fucking
parachute and makes so much sense,

4921
02:03:44,481 --> 02:03:44,900
doesn't it?

4922
02:03:44,900 --> 02:03:45,890
It doesn't make sense.

4923
02:03:45,891 --> 02:03:46,640
Does that make sense at all?

4924
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:50,060
Because the way of the parachute combined
with the way to the puck and play and

4925
02:03:50,061 --> 02:03:52,010
you'd probably run out
of gas halfway to Idaho,

4926
02:03:52,011 --> 02:03:53,150
the shit would fall apart.

4927
02:03:53,490 --> 02:03:55,670
We all dude out of whack.

4928
02:03:55,760 --> 02:04:00,660
The Boeing business jets range and
costs from 47 million to $310 million.

4929
02:04:01,970 --> 02:04:03,290
And you know she didn't get the cheap one.

4930
02:04:03,320 --> 02:04:03,701
Hell,

4931
02:04:03,701 --> 02:04:04,950
Oprah's a ballroom sign.

4932
02:04:04,970 --> 02:04:06,320
Blue Tooth right now.

4933
02:04:06,321 --> 02:04:09,530
She's got one ladies around her
all the time filing her nails,

4934
02:04:09,531 --> 02:04:10,370
one on each toe.

4935
02:04:10,371 --> 02:04:13,910
They're all white girls to all
white girls under 120 pounds.

4936
02:04:13,911 --> 02:04:14,750
It's all she asked for.

4937
02:04:14,751 --> 02:04:16,160
I want only white workers.

4938
02:04:16,610 --> 02:04:19,520
120 pounds or lighter skinny girls.

4939
02:04:19,540 --> 02:04:20,361
Pick a tone.

4940
02:04:20,361 --> 02:04:20,991
That's what she wants.

4941
02:04:20,991 --> 02:04:21,561
The skinniest,

4942
02:04:21,561 --> 02:04:26,561
prettiest girls to clean her toes and
feet wash cocoa butter on her elbows while

4943
02:04:26,571 --> 02:04:30,530
she talks about her
fucking $300 million jet,

4944
02:04:30,531 --> 02:04:32,330
but she's converted into a disco.

4945
02:04:32,390 --> 02:04:33,650
It's fucking nuts.

4946
02:04:33,651 --> 02:04:34,280
Right?

4947
02:04:34,280 --> 02:04:35,240
Do you think Oprah's game?

4948
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:36,980
Do I know you?

4949
02:04:37,110 --> 02:04:38,130
You don't really.

4950
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:39,360
You don't consider it at all?

4951
02:04:39,630 --> 02:04:40,181
That's the room,

4952
02:04:40,181 --> 02:04:40,450
right?

4953
02:04:40,450 --> 02:04:42,270
He's saying she's gay for that Gail jail.

4954
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:47,300
I think she's more asexual and
just a a power hungry ego maniac.

4955
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:49,140
Really?

4956
02:04:49,140 --> 02:04:49,530
Yeah,

4957
02:04:49,530 --> 02:04:50,220
totally.

4958
02:04:50,220 --> 02:04:52,470
You don't think she hires chicks
would come over and eat or box?

4959
02:04:52,650 --> 02:04:53,483
She Mike.

4960
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:54,593
I don't know.

4961
02:04:54,740 --> 02:04:58,970
She might see the thing that
would cause he just tell him yes.

4962
02:05:00,450 --> 02:05:00,810
Okay.

4963
02:05:00,810 --> 02:05:03,510
A girl think so come
over and he Oprah's box.

4964
02:05:03,910 --> 02:05:04,620
Uh,

4965
02:05:04,620 --> 02:05:06,270
I think she probably has a flat rate.

4966
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:07,440
Like maybe she's like listen,

4967
02:05:07,441 --> 02:05:09,470
you know you can work at Wendy's does.

4968
02:05:09,510 --> 02:05:10,730
They don't pay much more.

4969
02:05:10,740 --> 02:05:12,200
He can eat my box on 10 days.

4970
02:05:12,810 --> 02:05:13,410
10 G's.

4971
02:05:13,410 --> 02:05:13,710
Sure.

4972
02:05:13,710 --> 02:05:14,850
Thinking about 10 each pop.

4973
02:05:14,900 --> 02:05:15,540
Yup.

4974
02:05:15,540 --> 02:05:17,400
10 g's for a 20 minute session.

4975
02:05:17,430 --> 02:05:17,970
Yeah.

4976
02:05:17,970 --> 02:05:18,630
And that girl,

4977
02:05:18,630 --> 02:05:21,150
that's all she does and she just
works for Oprah every couple of days.

4978
02:05:21,151 --> 02:05:23,970
But she has like a little thing but she's
like I'll give you a little extra if

4979
02:05:23,971 --> 02:05:24,900
you make the pussy pop.

4980
02:05:24,900 --> 02:05:28,380
Like she has like a little tag
on it for and the goes like,

4981
02:05:28,381 --> 02:05:28,951
what's that mean?

4982
02:05:28,951 --> 02:05:30,610
Do you go in?

4983
02:05:30,950 --> 02:05:31,980
She calls it a pussy.

4984
02:05:32,350 --> 02:05:33,183
Yeah for sure.

4985
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:34,273
Yeah.

4986
02:05:34,630 --> 02:05:38,770
Really you think starts
staying box or stag box.

4987
02:05:39,770 --> 02:05:42,990
Cause you know sometimes when she gets
like she gets back to her old southern

4988
02:05:42,991 --> 02:05:43,651
route and she'd be like,

4989
02:05:43,651 --> 02:05:44,880
girl you know this shit.

4990
02:05:45,380 --> 02:05:47,310
I shouldn't say shit
but like this is done.

4991
02:05:47,311 --> 02:05:49,830
Let's just ground like
she'll really play it up.

4992
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:53,760
I think when she's in bed she's probably
like get that push to get a guarantee.

4993
02:05:53,761 --> 02:05:58,761
You if you could encapsulate the smell
of a Oprah Winfrey post binge diarrhea

4994
02:05:59,431 --> 02:06:00,264
blast,

4995
02:06:00,450 --> 02:06:02,220
cause she knows she must go on a binge.

4996
02:06:02,270 --> 02:06:03,081
She's drops heat,

4997
02:06:03,081 --> 02:06:03,750
she shirts,

4998
02:06:03,750 --> 02:06:05,550
she gets heavy bro and shit goes down.

4999
02:06:05,551 --> 02:06:08,670
She got real skinny for a while and then
she just pumps up and there's some meat

5000
02:06:08,671 --> 02:06:09,610
and going on their son.

5001
02:06:09,780 --> 02:06:11,220
There's a lot of stress
and that's how she,

5002
02:06:11,430 --> 02:06:13,730
if you could encapsulate it into like a,

5003
02:06:13,731 --> 02:06:15,900
a something that you could
open and smell her shit,

5004
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:17,670
I guarantee you people would buy it.

5005
02:06:17,730 --> 02:06:18,210
Yeah,

5006
02:06:18,210 --> 02:06:19,050
that'd be fascinated.

5007
02:06:19,051 --> 02:06:19,570
People are,

5008
02:06:19,570 --> 02:06:23,160
I love grape juice for a
certain amount of money.

5009
02:06:23,550 --> 02:06:24,151
If you just,

5010
02:06:24,151 --> 02:06:25,470
as long as you made it reasonable,

5011
02:06:25,471 --> 02:06:28,380
if you said smell Oprah shit for $1,

5012
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:29,970
you would make millions.

5013
02:06:29,971 --> 02:06:30,660
Yeah.

5014
02:06:30,660 --> 02:06:31,381
It's all a cost.

5015
02:06:31,381 --> 02:06:32,214
Like a buck.

5016
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:33,240
That's not,

5017
02:06:33,240 --> 02:06:34,270
that's not reasonable.

5018
02:06:34,280 --> 02:06:36,340
It's less than what we have a car it,

5019
02:06:37,170 --> 02:06:37,891
you might make five,

5020
02:06:37,891 --> 02:06:39,360
6 million bucks off that product.

5021
02:06:39,510 --> 02:06:39,990
Sure.

5022
02:06:39,990 --> 02:06:40,770
Why do we do it?

5023
02:06:40,770 --> 02:06:45,030
Why can't they encapsulate record smells
the way they record sound and visual.

5024
02:06:45,031 --> 02:06:47,040
It's just because there's not
that much of a demand for it.

5025
02:06:47,430 --> 02:06:49,290
It seems like they should
be able to do that by now.

5026
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:53,820
Like they should be able to put it a
smell into some sort of a reusable medium.

5027
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:54,150
You know,

5028
02:06:54,150 --> 02:06:55,320
visual medium is like,

5029
02:06:55,321 --> 02:06:56,310
they can record video.

5030
02:06:56,311 --> 02:06:57,300
You can watch that video.

5031
02:06:57,301 --> 02:06:58,350
It gets in through your eyes,

5032
02:06:58,530 --> 02:06:59,040
you know,

5033
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:00,330
why can't they record a smell?

5034
02:07:00,440 --> 02:07:01,273
Yeah.

5035
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:01,990
You know,

5036
02:07:01,990 --> 02:07:02,250
I mean,

5037
02:07:02,250 --> 02:07:04,500
cause you ever done the
like the film capsule thing.

5038
02:07:04,501 --> 02:07:05,334
You're doing that before.

5039
02:07:05,340 --> 02:07:08,520
What's that like the 35
millimeter film cart,

5040
02:07:08,521 --> 02:07:09,990
you know the little black thing,

5041
02:07:10,740 --> 02:07:12,780
Fortinet and then you encapsulate it.

5042
02:07:12,810 --> 02:07:13,081
Yeah.

5043
02:07:13,081 --> 02:07:14,120
You can close it that far.

5044
02:07:14,121 --> 02:07:16,050
It'll stay in their own way.

5045
02:07:16,051 --> 02:07:16,884
Yes it will.

5046
02:07:18,120 --> 02:07:18,331
Yes.

5047
02:07:18,331 --> 02:07:18,660
He will.

5048
02:07:18,660 --> 02:07:19,111
Confident.

5049
02:07:19,111 --> 02:07:22,500
I would bet on him be
amended with cups and jars.

5050
02:07:22,510 --> 02:07:23,580
You can do with jars too.

5051
02:07:23,680 --> 02:07:25,520
I've tried to,

5052
02:07:25,700 --> 02:07:27,220
you know,

5053
02:07:27,300 --> 02:07:28,350
and you also didn't fart.

5054
02:07:28,380 --> 02:07:29,870
Like you got to really be into farting.

5055
02:07:30,190 --> 02:07:34,050
I [inaudible] I farted on Christina
the other day when you were there.

5056
02:07:34,051 --> 02:07:34,440
I,

5057
02:07:34,440 --> 02:07:35,140
yes.

5058
02:07:35,140 --> 02:07:35,680
We're all walking,

5059
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:35,980
hanging out of

5060
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:38,080
the office and I'd just
trailed her whole leg,

5061
02:07:38,081 --> 02:07:38,400
the whole

5062
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:39,233
damn dude.

5063
02:07:39,330 --> 02:07:41,770
Why don't you find that his
wife don't fart on my life.

5064
02:07:41,780 --> 02:07:42,900
So it was respectful,

5065
02:07:42,910 --> 02:07:43,743
man.

5066
02:07:44,710 --> 02:07:46,290
My daughter parts on me all the time.

5067
02:07:46,530 --> 02:07:47,720
We were watching TV shows with her.

5068
02:07:47,721 --> 02:07:49,440
She's sitting on my lap and
she just starts farting.

5069
02:07:49,830 --> 02:07:51,450
Three year olds don't give a fuck,

5070
02:07:51,480 --> 02:07:52,313
but you just go.

5071
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:53,550
It's just foreign to me.

5072
02:07:53,551 --> 02:07:53,851
She goes,

5073
02:07:53,851 --> 02:07:54,750
yeah,

5074
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:56,820
that's farts on you.

5075
02:07:57,060 --> 02:07:59,670
That's gotta be the only
time that doesn't bother you.

5076
02:08:00,390 --> 02:08:01,410
If your daughter,

5077
02:08:01,411 --> 02:08:01,690
you're like,

5078
02:08:01,690 --> 02:08:02,523
yeah,

5079
02:08:02,610 --> 02:08:03,443
it is what it is.

5080
02:08:03,450 --> 02:08:06,870
You know I gotta I gotta wipe her
but still make sure it's done right.

5081
02:08:07,180 --> 02:08:07,850
Flush.

5082
02:08:07,850 --> 02:08:09,030
Flush your logs.

5083
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:10,680
If a baby's log,

5084
02:08:10,681 --> 02:08:11,610
a three year old baby,

5085
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:13,860
if the your log was in proportionate,

5086
02:08:13,861 --> 02:08:16,020
it would be the size
of your fucking thigh.

5087
02:08:16,470 --> 02:08:16,771
Oh yeah.

5088
02:08:16,771 --> 02:08:18,050
Cause they have big old shit.

5089
02:08:18,690 --> 02:08:19,523
Shit.

5090
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:20,100
They,

5091
02:08:20,100 --> 02:08:21,230
they eat so much.

5092
02:08:21,240 --> 02:08:23,340
You know the kids are
always hungry growing,

5093
02:08:23,670 --> 02:08:26,020
so they just fucking packed that
food and it comes out like a,

5094
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:27,420
like a grown up shit.

5095
02:08:27,600 --> 02:08:27,940
Yeah.

5096
02:08:27,940 --> 02:08:29,160
You tried to do the math,

5097
02:08:29,161 --> 02:08:30,210
like that's ridiculous.

5098
02:08:30,810 --> 02:08:31,501
I love taking,

5099
02:08:31,501 --> 02:08:33,120
she's going to have a
little Tommy running around.

5100
02:08:33,121 --> 02:08:37,230
You and Christina at some point live
rounds in there and get the party rolling.

5101
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:38,310
Definitely at some point.

5102
02:08:38,311 --> 02:08:39,960
I definitely want kids right now.

5103
02:08:40,190 --> 02:08:41,023
Great couple.

5104
02:08:41,220 --> 02:08:44,380
She is 35 that's when you got
to start thinking about it.

5105
02:08:44,390 --> 02:08:44,580
Yeah.

5106
02:08:44,580 --> 02:08:45,630
You got to start thinking about,

5107
02:08:45,631 --> 02:08:46,464
you know your,

5108
02:08:46,580 --> 02:08:46,800
your,

5109
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:47,071
your,

5110
02:08:47,071 --> 02:08:47,904
your window.

5111
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:51,120
I don't know what the window
is for it to be healthy,

5112
02:08:51,121 --> 02:08:52,230
but we're going to get on it.

5113
02:08:52,270 --> 02:08:52,501
Yeah,

5114
02:08:52,501 --> 02:08:54,560
we're going to get on it too.

5115
02:08:54,930 --> 02:08:55,420
Yeah.

5116
02:08:55,420 --> 02:08:56,280
I should fill in the whole thing.

5117
02:08:56,310 --> 02:08:57,720
The porn right up to it.

5118
02:08:57,740 --> 02:08:58,001
Oh yeah.

5119
02:08:58,001 --> 02:09:00,510
It could be a new reality show
by the time your kid is born.

5120
02:09:00,511 --> 02:09:01,740
That will be passe.

5121
02:09:01,950 --> 02:09:04,890
Kim Kardashians will have already
had like a cervix reality show.

5122
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:06,353
Kim Kardashians,

5123
02:09:06,390 --> 02:09:06,901
a new show.

5124
02:09:06,901 --> 02:09:11,901
It's going to be a microchip little
camera where you can just see the black

5125
02:09:11,911 --> 02:09:14,370
dicks going in after the other.

5126
02:09:14,490 --> 02:09:15,570
That's the whole show.

5127
02:09:15,790 --> 02:09:19,830
The whole show is a 24 hour
internet cam inside her pussy.

5128
02:09:20,070 --> 02:09:22,320
It's all Wifi and it and it,

5129
02:09:23,460 --> 02:09:24,480
it's all fucked up.

5130
02:09:27,780 --> 02:09:28,680
You would pay for that.

5131
02:09:28,710 --> 02:09:29,543
Would you pay for that?

5132
02:09:29,880 --> 02:09:31,290
And that was in the playboy channel.

5133
02:09:31,410 --> 02:09:32,101
If they agreed,

5134
02:09:32,101 --> 02:09:33,000
if a girl agreed to do that,

5135
02:09:33,001 --> 02:09:35,070
please someone out there steal this idea.

5136
02:09:35,370 --> 02:09:36,980
Get a girl who looks like Kim Kardashian,

5137
02:09:36,990 --> 02:09:38,160
pretended to Kim Kardashians,

5138
02:09:38,440 --> 02:09:39,180
lie to me,

5139
02:09:39,180 --> 02:09:43,080
say this may or may not be Kim credit
actually is pussy and get a girl to put a

5140
02:09:43,081 --> 02:09:44,880
24 hour webcam inside a box.

5141
02:09:45,700 --> 02:09:47,180
But he stole the idea
from me the other day,

5142
02:09:47,181 --> 02:09:47,910
by the way.

5143
02:09:47,910 --> 02:09:48,743
I didn't know.

5144
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:49,140
Well,

5145
02:09:49,140 --> 02:09:49,530
yeah,

5146
02:09:49,530 --> 02:09:51,770
I could totally be parallel
thinking for years.

5147
02:09:51,771 --> 02:09:52,491
I've said,

5148
02:09:52,491 --> 02:09:53,730
and I even said it just a,

5149
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:54,050
uh,

5150
02:09:54,050 --> 02:09:55,490
last week on the podcast,

5151
02:09:55,491 --> 02:09:57,470
but I sit on one of your old old podcasts.

5152
02:09:57,620 --> 02:10:01,070
I can't remember that I had this
idea that called snail mail.

5153
02:10:01,250 --> 02:10:03,240
And where I thought about when,

5154
02:10:03,241 --> 02:10:05,270
when my grandmother was still
alive that she doesn't get,

5155
02:10:05,271 --> 02:10:06,170
have a computer,

5156
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:09,740
but I wanted to be able to like write an
email and then send it to a company and

5157
02:10:09,741 --> 02:10:12,920
that company would write it out and
send her like a handwritten letter,

5158
02:10:13,070 --> 02:10:13,251
you know?

5159
02:10:13,251 --> 02:10:17,810
So it'd be easy for me to write letters
to my grandmother for a charge the other

5160
02:10:17,810 --> 02:10:17,811
day.

5161
02:10:17,811 --> 02:10:21,980
I had a Freddy Lockhart podcast and I
talked about it and then two yesterday,

5162
02:10:22,130 --> 02:10:27,130
gizmodo.com said this like artists guy
did that and he's called snail mail to

5163
02:10:27,680 --> 02:10:32,660
email or email to snail
mail.com or something like
that and that's what this new

5164
02:10:32,661 --> 02:10:33,710
company gone.

5165
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:34,491
Well,

5166
02:10:34,491 --> 02:10:35,750
if they stole from you,

5167
02:10:35,751 --> 02:10:38,120
I hope the fucking day
crashed to the ground.

5168
02:10:38,121 --> 02:10:39,980
Bryan's guess not cool man.

5169
02:10:40,010 --> 02:10:41,450
That's not cool at all.

5170
02:10:41,480 --> 02:10:42,380
How long have they been around?

5171
02:10:42,650 --> 02:10:43,850
I think since yesterday.

5172
02:10:43,851 --> 02:10:45,230
And you allow them to steal it from you.

5173
02:10:45,231 --> 02:10:46,090
You don't want a piece of that.

5174
02:10:46,100 --> 02:10:46,530
There's no money.

5175
02:10:46,530 --> 02:10:49,550
He's doing it for free so it's
like more of an art project.

5176
02:10:49,560 --> 02:10:51,320
I think those guys for your idea,

5177
02:10:51,321 --> 02:10:52,220
you welcome it.

5178
02:10:52,250 --> 02:10:53,083
You have your hand.

5179
02:10:53,300 --> 02:10:53,511
Okay,

5180
02:10:53,511 --> 02:10:53,751
good.

5181
02:10:53,751 --> 02:10:54,584
That's nice.

5182
02:10:54,650 --> 02:10:55,470
That's very thoughtful of it.

5183
02:10:55,470 --> 02:10:56,330
It's nice you're,

5184
02:10:56,331 --> 02:10:57,920
you're contributing to the world,

5185
02:10:57,980 --> 02:10:58,370
right?

5186
02:10:58,370 --> 02:10:59,420
You little wacky ideas.

5187
02:10:59,580 --> 02:11:00,231
I've had time.

5188
02:11:00,231 --> 02:11:01,160
I would have done it myself.

5189
02:11:01,340 --> 02:11:03,780
If you don't know a and you
can't get enough of Brian,

5190
02:11:03,810 --> 02:11:04,041
you're like,

5191
02:11:04,041 --> 02:11:04,341
God,

5192
02:11:04,341 --> 02:11:06,000
who's that dude stumbling
through a sentences?

5193
02:11:06,020 --> 02:11:06,920
I fucking love him.

5194
02:11:07,070 --> 02:11:07,600
His stone.

5195
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:08,060
You can.

5196
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:08,271
Yeah,

5197
02:11:08,271 --> 02:11:08,931
he has two stone.

5198
02:11:08,931 --> 02:11:11,330
Brian is a way smoother talker
before he does the podcast,

5199
02:11:11,331 --> 02:11:16,331
but I knew that I was going to get
past that third hit his way and he's

5200
02:11:16,761 --> 02:11:17,330
impulsive.

5201
02:11:17,330 --> 02:11:19,520
He's gonna say yes and I
know he shouldn't have it,

5202
02:11:19,670 --> 02:11:22,210
but part of me wants to see him
take you to give me a third head,

5203
02:11:22,640 --> 02:11:24,280
gave you that third hand realize no,

5204
02:11:24,290 --> 02:11:25,280
I took the third hit too.

5205
02:11:25,340 --> 02:11:26,300
I'm just starting to come back.

5206
02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:28,210
I'm on a Machu Picchu high.

5207
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:31,010
The entire time we were talking I
was thinking about Machu Picchu.

5208
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:33,561
Plan your trip,

5209
02:11:33,561 --> 02:11:33,891
man.

5210
02:11:33,891 --> 02:11:34,724
You plan your trip.

5211
02:11:34,820 --> 02:11:35,550
Yeah.

5212
02:11:35,550 --> 02:11:35,961
That's hard.

5213
02:11:35,961 --> 02:11:36,820
When you have little ones,

5214
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:37,850
I don't think they'd be down.

5215
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:41,390
I got to tell him Mickey mouse
is at the top as what I'll do.

5216
02:11:41,570 --> 02:11:42,440
I'll hire some dudes,

5217
02:11:42,441 --> 02:11:45,830
dress like Mickey and Donald and there'll
be waiting for me at the top of my

5218
02:11:45,831 --> 02:11:46,664
jewelry shoes

5219
02:11:50,380 --> 02:11:51,111
and the kids would like,

5220
02:11:51,111 --> 02:11:51,471
Daddy,

5221
02:11:51,471 --> 02:11:52,071
let's go back.

5222
02:11:52,071 --> 02:11:52,904
I can't breathe.

5223
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:56,960
It's not the ideal place for
little kids to see the big rocks.

5224
02:11:56,961 --> 02:11:58,160
I'm here for the big rocks.

5225
02:11:58,161 --> 02:11:58,621
You're fucks.

5226
02:11:58,621 --> 02:12:00,770
You don't let your kids
have lemonade stands.

5227
02:12:00,771 --> 02:12:03,530
I saw lemonade stand the
other day and it blew my mind.

5228
02:12:03,531 --> 02:12:03,771
I was like,

5229
02:12:03,771 --> 02:12:04,400
wait,

5230
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:05,233
you gotta be parents?

5231
02:12:05,470 --> 02:12:10,040
These kids on the side of a street
and that's an open item shopping.

5232
02:12:10,041 --> 02:12:10,874
Yeah.

5233
02:12:11,390 --> 02:12:12,171
What the fuck is that?

5234
02:12:12,171 --> 02:12:13,140
And there was no parents anywhere.

5235
02:12:13,150 --> 02:12:14,420
Where about after to the house?

5236
02:12:14,421 --> 02:12:15,254
The poor guy

5237
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,380
and in Brooklyn.

5238
02:12:17,410 --> 02:12:18,041
Did you hear about this?

5239
02:12:18,041 --> 02:12:18,371
Where the,

5240
02:12:18,371 --> 02:12:20,290
the little kid asks for directions.

5241
02:12:20,291 --> 02:12:21,670
He's on his way home from school.

5242
02:12:21,671 --> 02:12:22,480
He's eight years old,

5243
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:26,560
asked for directions they can't find them
and they find video of the kid at the

5244
02:12:26,561 --> 02:12:29,110
playground talking to some man
that go to the man's house.

5245
02:12:29,111 --> 02:12:31,630
The kids chopped up in
his frigerator file.

5246
02:12:31,690 --> 02:12:32,200
No.

5247
02:12:32,200 --> 02:12:34,210
Yeah cause an orthodox Jew too,

5248
02:12:34,240 --> 02:12:37,480
which really shocked the Jewish community
because the other kid was a Hasidic

5249
02:12:37,480 --> 02:12:38,100
Jew and it's you,

5250
02:12:38,100 --> 02:12:39,680
a very tight knit Jewish community.

5251
02:12:39,700 --> 02:12:40,000
There's,

5252
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:41,950
this guy was an orthodox Jew,

5253
02:12:42,010 --> 02:12:43,600
killed this fucking
kid and chopped him up.

5254
02:12:43,601 --> 02:12:44,620
And I did think it was like,

5255
02:12:44,621 --> 02:12:45,221
it was weird.

5256
02:12:45,221 --> 02:12:45,761
Like yesterday,

5257
02:12:45,761 --> 02:12:50,761
I'm driving down like Glendale Boulevard
and it's like sundown and you see like

5258
02:12:52,070 --> 02:12:54,100
a saw two girls that were probably like,

5259
02:12:54,700 --> 02:12:55,121
I dunno,

5260
02:12:55,121 --> 02:12:59,830
maybe like 1213 just walking down
the street and it's not like a bad

5261
02:12:59,831 --> 02:13:00,664
neighborhood.

5262
02:13:00,770 --> 02:13:01,330
And you're like,

5263
02:13:01,330 --> 02:13:03,190
you shouldn't be walking
down in Glendale Boulevard.

5264
02:13:03,250 --> 02:13:04,090
Like you're too young.

5265
02:13:04,091 --> 02:13:04,840
Like they,

5266
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:07,200
like cars are flying by and there's,

5267
02:13:07,220 --> 02:13:07,620
there's,

5268
02:13:07,620 --> 02:13:07,860
it's,

5269
02:13:07,860 --> 02:13:08,501
it's still la.

5270
02:13:08,501 --> 02:13:10,510
There's Weirdos on any street.

5271
02:13:10,511 --> 02:13:11,410
Just walking around.

5272
02:13:11,650 --> 02:13:12,610
It does make me go like,

5273
02:13:12,611 --> 02:13:12,850
man,

5274
02:13:12,850 --> 02:13:13,601
I thought like,

5275
02:13:13,601 --> 02:13:16,180
I would definitely not be cool
with my kid walking around.

5276
02:13:16,810 --> 02:13:17,051
You know,

5277
02:13:17,051 --> 02:13:19,390
you live well just like that street.

5278
02:13:19,391 --> 02:13:20,020
Like it's not a,

5279
02:13:20,020 --> 02:13:20,381
it's not,

5280
02:13:20,381 --> 02:13:20,831
that wasn't like,

5281
02:13:20,831 --> 02:13:22,330
it's not a residential street man.

5282
02:13:22,331 --> 02:13:22,970
Like it's,

5283
02:13:22,970 --> 02:13:23,271
it's a,

5284
02:13:23,271 --> 02:13:24,610
it's like a highway almost.

5285
02:13:24,630 --> 02:13:26,980
It's why people always want to go to
the suburbs once they have children.

5286
02:13:27,300 --> 02:13:27,581
It's like,

5287
02:13:27,581 --> 02:13:27,791
wow,

5288
02:13:27,791 --> 02:13:28,381
this high,

5289
02:13:28,381 --> 02:13:29,410
this is just too crazy.

5290
02:13:29,610 --> 02:13:29,800
Yeah.

5291
02:13:29,800 --> 02:13:32,160
I sort of admire people that
raise their kids in New York

5292
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:32,421
City.

5293
02:13:32,421 --> 02:13:32,641
I'm like,

5294
02:13:32,641 --> 02:13:33,150
wow,

5295
02:13:33,150 --> 02:13:35,280
what a wild ride that's gotta be for kids,

5296
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:35,831
you know,

5297
02:13:35,831 --> 02:13:39,630
to grow up in the hub of
North American civilization.

5298
02:13:39,660 --> 02:13:39,960
Yeah.

5299
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:42,060
I mean New York City is
unlike any other city.

5300
02:13:42,061 --> 02:13:45,240
You can call all a la a city all you want,

5301
02:13:45,241 --> 02:13:46,350
but it's really not.

5302
02:13:46,590 --> 02:13:46,951
It's a,

5303
02:13:46,951 --> 02:13:50,100
it's a destination to destination.

5304
02:13:50,150 --> 02:13:50,420
It is.

5305
02:13:50,420 --> 02:13:51,360
La is an area,

5306
02:13:51,420 --> 02:13:52,081
it's a place,

5307
02:13:52,081 --> 02:13:52,950
but it's not a city.

5308
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:55,680
New York City is a fucking city man.

5309
02:13:55,830 --> 02:13:59,400
When you're in staying in a hotel and you
open your window and everywhere around

5310
02:13:59,401 --> 02:14:01,320
you or 60 70 stories,

5311
02:14:01,321 --> 02:14:04,040
skyscrapers and you're
looking down to the ground,

5312
02:14:04,060 --> 02:14:06,870
there's fucking millions of people looking
out their windows and looking at you

5313
02:14:06,871 --> 02:14:11,871
and you see this giant thing that's
created and on this little island that's a

5314
02:14:12,001 --> 02:14:14,070
fucking city and others,

5315
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:19,160
that's the human experience and its
and its highest rpm form and you know

5316
02:14:20,450 --> 02:14:24,060
there's giant construction
where everything's built up,

5317
02:14:24,180 --> 02:14:24,481
you know,

5318
02:14:24,481 --> 02:14:27,630
they don't have any room to go east
and West so they go north and south.

5319
02:14:27,630 --> 02:14:29,580
You know what the fuck.

5320
02:14:29,581 --> 02:14:33,930
That's a weird place to all east coast
cities have that a different vibe and

5321
02:14:33,931 --> 02:14:38,640
feel then like out here like yeah you
know San Francisco is a proper city like

5322
02:14:38,641 --> 02:14:39,900
in a tight kind of thing.

5323
02:14:39,901 --> 02:14:42,390
But like you know like Philly,

5324
02:14:42,510 --> 02:14:43,410
Baltimore,

5325
02:14:43,800 --> 02:14:44,161
New York,

5326
02:14:44,161 --> 02:14:44,851
those are like,

5327
02:14:44,851 --> 02:14:46,530
those are cities where there's,

5328
02:14:46,590 --> 02:14:48,360
you can feel the city is alive here.

5329
02:14:48,361 --> 02:14:49,840
You don't really hear the,

5330
02:14:49,850 --> 02:14:50,550
yeah,

5331
02:14:50,550 --> 02:14:51,383
the city,

5332
02:14:51,670 --> 02:14:52,980
the city is filled with pukes too.

5333
02:14:53,140 --> 02:14:53,360
Yeah.

5334
02:14:53,360 --> 02:14:55,020
It was filled with people
that are trying to get famous,

5335
02:14:55,300 --> 02:14:57,270
so the vibe of the city's all fucked up.

5336
02:14:57,570 --> 02:14:58,403
Totally.

5337
02:14:58,940 --> 02:14:59,401
That's right,

5338
02:14:59,401 --> 02:14:59,880
la.

5339
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:00,713
I said it.

5340
02:15:00,870 --> 02:15:03,690
How about you just suck it Brian,

5341
02:15:03,691 --> 02:15:04,550
we doing tweeting.

5342
02:15:04,870 --> 02:15:08,610
It's the end of this fucking Goddamn
podcasts and she was thinking it was fun.

5343
02:15:08,640 --> 02:15:09,710
It's always fun all the time.

5344
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:13,320
It's a girl and if you think Tommy is
hilarious when you hear him talk on the

5345
02:15:13,321 --> 02:15:14,154
podcast,

5346
02:15:14,490 --> 02:15:16,620
you can also check him on his podcast,

5347
02:15:16,621 --> 02:15:21,300
which is your mom's house that you can
catch on the desk squad network and a my

5348
02:15:21,301 --> 02:15:24,900
favorite ones to do it to of course use
hilarious and so is his wife and they do

5349
02:15:24,901 --> 02:15:25,321
it together,

5350
02:15:25,321 --> 02:15:26,460
which is a little bit pussy whipped,

5351
02:15:26,461 --> 02:15:27,330
but we're going to let them slide,

5352
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:28,860
you know it is what it is.

5353
02:15:28,900 --> 02:15:29,191
It is.

5354
02:15:29,191 --> 02:15:29,670
It's great.

5355
02:15:29,670 --> 02:15:30,503
I love it.

5356
02:15:31,150 --> 02:15:32,220
His wife is super cool.

5357
02:15:32,310 --> 02:15:33,480
I remember when I met your wife,

5358
02:15:33,720 --> 02:15:38,130
your wife was going on at the naughty
show and there was a fucking a girl beaten

5359
02:15:38,131 --> 02:15:40,420
a dude with a belt right before your,

5360
02:15:40,421 --> 02:15:41,254
your chick went up.

5361
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:43,320
And I was talking to her and she's like,

5362
02:15:43,470 --> 02:15:44,610
what the fuck am I going to do with it?

5363
02:15:44,611 --> 02:15:45,444
How am I going to follow this?

5364
02:15:45,690 --> 02:15:46,050
And I like,

5365
02:15:46,050 --> 02:15:46,441
wow,

5366
02:15:46,441 --> 02:15:47,370
she's got to follow that.

5367
02:15:47,371 --> 02:15:48,360
Like that's going to be hard.

5368
02:15:48,361 --> 02:15:48,860
Like,

5369
02:15:48,860 --> 02:15:49,080
you know,

5370
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:52,020
these people are screaming and
cheering and she just rocked it.

5371
02:15:52,430 --> 02:15:52,831
She went up,

5372
02:15:52,831 --> 02:15:53,340
brushes,

5373
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:53,930
sued.

5374
02:15:53,930 --> 02:15:55,380
She's hilarious man.

5375
02:15:55,530 --> 02:16:00,180
Super relaxed and super confident and
he follow her on Twitter to go give out

5376
02:16:00,181 --> 02:16:00,541

02:16:00,541 --> 02:16:02,340
And Twitter is a at Christina,

5378

5381
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:07,240
Christina p.

02:16:07,830 --> 02:16:08,663
and uh,

5384
02:16:08,910 --> 02:16:09,210

5385
02:16:09,210 --> 02:16:09,541

5386
02:16:09,541 --> 02:16:10,171
she's awesome.

5387
02:16:10,171 --> 02:16:10,810
She's hilarious.

5388
02:16:10,810 --> 02:16:12,810
If you really want to
see Tom at his finest,

5389
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:14,300
you got to go see him do stand up.

5390
02:16:14,490 --> 02:16:16,380
He's at the Ice House
this weekend with me,

5391
02:16:16,440 --> 02:16:17,760
but it's sold the fuck out,

5392
02:16:17,761 --> 02:16:18,360
son.

5393
02:16:18,360 --> 02:16:18,781
Yo,

5394
02:16:18,781 --> 02:16:21,900
me and Joey Diaz and Tommy Segura.

5395
02:16:22,050 --> 02:16:22,411
But uh,

5396
02:16:22,411 --> 02:16:23,250
when else can they see you?

5397
02:16:23,251 --> 02:16:24,084
Where are you going to be out?

5398
02:16:24,090 --> 02:16:24,450
Ah,

5399
02:16:24,450 --> 02:16:28,140
well next Tuesday I'm going to
be in Montreal for the festival.

5400
02:16:28,141 --> 02:16:31,280
In Tuesday night I'm to do Ari
show at midnight in Montreal.

5401
02:16:31,580 --> 02:16:32,260
Wow.

Oh beautiful.

5403
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:35,380
I'm doing other shows throughout
the week at the festival.

5404
02:16:35,381 --> 02:16:37,630
Like I'm doing a HBO Canada Show,

5405
02:16:37,900 --> 02:16:38,510

5406

It's a storytelling show.

5411
02:16:47,860 --> 02:16:48,610
Where's it at?

5412
02:16:48,610 --> 02:16:49,380
I don't know.

5413
02:16:49,380 --> 02:16:49,651
I don't.

5414
02:16:49,651 --> 02:16:50,620
So it's in Montreal.

5415
02:16:50,990 --> 02:16:51,823
In Montreal.

5416
02:16:52,030 --> 02:16:53,020
If you want to find it,

5426
02:17:08,660 --> 02:17:09,970
like striding in his lane.

5427
02:17:09,971 --> 02:17:11,620
Like he's really fucking blowing up.

5428
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:13,240
His standup is getting
better to everything.

5429
02:17:13,241 --> 02:17:14,140
Everything's coming together.

5430
02:17:14,170 --> 02:17:15,190
He's doing fantastic.

5431
02:17:15,191 --> 02:17:16,001

I'll be in Denver at the Denver Improv.

5433
02:17:18,190 --> 02:17:18,791
Oh Shit.

5434
02:17:18,791 --> 02:17:19,360

And you can travel with
your wife or who you are.

5437

I know who I'm working with.

5438
02:17:23,951 --> 02:17:25,150
I just know that I'm doing it.

5439
02:17:25,670 --> 02:17:26,210
Nice.

5440
02:17:26,210 --> 02:17:26,710
Yeah.

5441
02:17:26,710 --> 02:17:27,640
Do they have you headline in there?

5442
02:17:27,680 --> 02:17:28,120
Yeah.

5443

5444
02:17:28,730 --> 02:17:29,110
Yes.

5445

Dirty bitches.

5446
02:17:29,950 --> 02:17:30,191

5448
02:17:30,940 --> 02:17:31,601
that'll be a lot of fun.

5449
02:17:31,601 --> 02:17:32,890
So paramount theater,

5451
02:17:34,630 --> 02:17:36,820
Joe Diaz returns to Colorado home,

5452
02:17:36,970 --> 02:17:38,320
tried to blacklist him.

5453
02:17:38,410 --> 02:17:41,240
We would not allow it this Sunday.

5454
02:17:41,241 --> 02:17:42,160
A Michael Chavela.

5455
02:17:42,161 --> 02:17:43,480
We'll be doing a podcast with me.

5456
02:17:43,790 --> 02:17:44,350
So Brian's,

5457
02:17:44,350 --> 02:17:44,441
Oh,

5458
02:17:44,441 --> 02:17:45,274
I love Mike.

5459
02:17:45,340 --> 02:17:49,450
He's a great guy and he's going to hang
out at the house and his missus was

5460
02:17:49,451 --> 02:17:51,910

I'm going to throw it out on a fucking

5461
02:17:52,150 --> 02:17:52,810

5462
02:17:52,810 --> 02:17:53,001
Yeah,

5463
02:17:53,001 --> 02:17:53,834
great.

5464
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:57,220
I saw them in Melbourne and he took
me to a very beautiful bathroom,

5465
02:17:57,750 --> 02:17:58,660
a beautiful bathroom.

5466
02:17:58,770 --> 02:17:59,620
I haven't to tell you about it.

5467
02:17:59,630 --> 02:18:00,250
Okay.

5468
02:18:00,250 --> 02:18:01,083
He's a great guy.

5469
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:01,953
I love that dude.

5470
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:03,550
So that's it for this week.

02:18:15,850 --> 02:18:18,910
And we've got a bunch of other people
that were going to try to get in here.

5478
02:18:18,940 --> 02:18:19,773
Um,

5481
02:18:23,710 --> 02:18:25,690
few different things Brian ever saw.

5482
02:18:25,691 --> 02:18:26,590
I think he's gonna do it.

5483
02:18:26,591 --> 02:18:26,870
We're going to,

5484

02:18:30,971 --> 02:18:35,320
filming the ultimate fighter and we've
got a lot of shit going down pitches and

5486
02:18:35,321 --> 02:18:35,620

5487
02:18:35,620 --> 02:18:36,453

5488
02:18:36,460 --> 02:18:38,140
which we should be moving into very soon.

5489
02:18:38,140 --> 02:18:40,300
I gotta I gotta as soon as I'm done here,

5490
02:18:40,301 --> 02:18:41,111
I'm going right there.

5491
02:18:41,111 --> 02:18:42,330
I'm looking at shit so that,

5492
02:18:42,430 --> 02:18:42,611

5493
02:18:42,611 --> 02:18:42,911

5494
02:18:42,911 --> 02:18:43,541
you got to come with me,

5495
02:18:43,541 --> 02:18:44,350
bitch.

5496
02:18:44,350 --> 02:18:45,670
I can't come on son.

5497
02:18:45,730 --> 02:18:46,510
You have a new studio.

5498
02:18:46,510 --> 02:18:47,560
We're going to make a new studio.

5499
02:18:47,590 --> 02:18:48,750
We've got to make a studio in a,

5500
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:51,520
we're going to do something
in an actual office building.

5501
02:18:51,550 --> 02:18:52,383
No Shit.

5502
02:18:52,390 --> 02:18:53,170
Yeah man,

5503
02:18:53,170 --> 02:18:55,540
I can't keep doing this
in my fucking my office.

5504
02:18:55,541 --> 02:18:56,890
My kids were in the background screaming.

5505
02:18:56,930 --> 02:19:00,370
I feel like a Douche bag dad that I want
them to be quiet in their own house.

5506
02:19:00,610 --> 02:19:01,443
Yeah.

5507
02:19:01,770 --> 02:19:04,390
In one way it's kind of cool cause I
like hearing like a little kid screams in

5508
02:19:04,391 --> 02:19:05,320
the background every now and then.

5509
02:19:06,070 --> 02:19:06,221
Well,

5510
02:19:06,221 --> 02:19:08,570
right now we're to bring these
skanks over the house either.

5511
02:19:08,610 --> 02:19:09,101
Let's be honest,

5512
02:19:09,101 --> 02:19:09,611
ladies and gentlemen,

5513
02:19:09,611 --> 02:19:10,444
that's part of the program.

5514
02:19:11,220 --> 02:19:12,430
Or the program is a,

5515
02:19:12,520 --> 02:19:13,780
I can't bring any skanks over here.

5516
02:19:13,960 --> 02:19:14,650
And this is rocky.

5517
02:19:14,650 --> 02:19:15,430
Doesn't like it.

5518
02:19:15,430 --> 02:19:16,600
The only time we've had skanks,

5519
02:19:16,630 --> 02:19:17,463
excuse me,

5520
02:19:17,680 --> 02:19:18,190
uh,

5521
02:19:18,190 --> 02:19:19,060
questionable people.

5522
02:19:19,061 --> 02:19:21,100
Or we did it over at Brian's house.

5523
02:19:21,130 --> 02:19:21,671
So by now,

5524
02:19:21,671 --> 02:19:22,504
you know who you are.

5525
02:19:22,800 --> 02:19:24,190
Yeah.

5526
02:19:24,210 --> 02:19:25,990
So Andy Dick,

5527
02:19:26,820 --> 02:19:27,230
that's,

5528
02:19:27,230 --> 02:19:28,310
that's how the cookie crumbles.

5529
02:19:28,450 --> 02:19:29,240
Hookers.

5530
02:19:29,240 --> 02:19:30,073
All right.

5531
02:19:30,110 --> 02:19:30,560
Listen,

5532
02:19:30,560 --> 02:19:31,220
love you guys.

5533
02:19:31,220 --> 02:19:33,620
I can't wait for a Pasadena
Ice House this weekend.

5534
02:19:33,770 --> 02:19:34,670
According to the website.

5535
02:19:34,671 --> 02:19:35,301
It's sold out.

5536
02:19:35,301 --> 02:19:36,670
But if you go there were,

5537
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:37,850
you know who the fuck knows?

5538
02:19:37,851 --> 02:19:39,500
There might be some tickets
laying around calling them.

5539
02:19:39,800 --> 02:19:41,030
What the fuck do I know?

5540
02:19:41,090 --> 02:19:43,100
Can't wait to see everybody
and I'll see you Sunday.

5541
02:19:43,130 --> 02:19:43,470
All right,

5542
02:19:43,470 --> 02:19:44,360
let me come on.

5543
02:19:44,410 --> 02:19:45,243
Give me a kiss.

5544
02:19:45,540 --> 02:19:46,550
She's angry.

5545
02:19:47,770 --> 02:19:47,900
Oh,

5546
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:48,733
that's right.

5547
02:19:49,130 --> 02:19:49,950
I always forget.

5548
02:19:49,950 --> 02:19:50,450
Um,

5549
02:19:50,450 --> 02:19:54,650
the Joe Rogan experience podcast was
brought to you by the fleshlight.

5550
02:19:55,190 --> 02:20:00,140
Go to Joe rogan.net and click on the
link for the flashlight and you enter in

5551
02:20:00,141 --> 02:20:00,990
the code name Rogan.

5552
02:20:00,991 --> 02:20:03,620
You will get 15% off the
number one sex toy for men.

5553
02:20:03,770 --> 02:20:05,490
And then what you do is you,

5554
02:20:05,570 --> 02:20:05,970
um,

5555
02:20:05,970 --> 02:20:09,560
you take it and you open up the box and
you stick your penis inside of it and

5556
02:20:09,561 --> 02:20:10,394
you go like task.

5557
02:20:11,390 --> 02:20:12,223
And then you go to sleep.

5558
02:20:13,360 --> 02:20:14,090
It's the best.

5559
02:20:14,090 --> 02:20:14,923
It's the best.

5560
02:20:15,020 --> 02:20:16,400
So we love you.

5561
02:20:17,210 --> 02:20:18,410
We hope you love us back.

5562
02:20:18,980 --> 02:20:19,610
Bye Bye.

5563
02:20:19,610 --> 02:20:20,110
Bye Bye.

5564
02:20:20,110 --> 02:20:20,310
Hi.
