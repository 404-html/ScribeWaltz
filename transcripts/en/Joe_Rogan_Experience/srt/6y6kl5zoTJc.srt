1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,620
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,320
but there's no way of
getting a New York City less.

3
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:05,320
You pay him some money.

4
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,410
You want to take those
bridges from Staten Island,

5
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:08,131
you can pay me,

6
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:08,964
bitch,

7
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,990
you're coming in from Jersey,

8
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:11,010
pay me.

9
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,660
You got to pay to get in here dog.

10
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,000
It's like an amusing because
it cost anything to leave.

11
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,370
It doesn't Cost York and
deleted all of my funds.

12
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,253
And uh,

13
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,090
both times when I moved out of New York,

14
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:24,600
I,

15
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,040
as I crossed the free bridge,

16
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,630
I thought it doesn't
cost anything to leave.

17
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,980
Isn't that fascinating?

18
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:29,780
It's,

19
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,250
is it to regulate how many people come
in and is it to mitigate traffic and to

20
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:36,360
make it like problematic
because it cost so much money.

21
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:37,370
Maybe a Carpool.

22
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,000
Is that the idea?

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,833
To tell you a little story?

24
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,693
Sure.

25
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,140
To me,

26
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:40,973
and they won.

27
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,540
It is a big story actually,

28
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,830
and I was reminded of,

29
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,760
but you're talking about the George
Washington Bridge and when I was 20 years

30
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:47,971
old,

31
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:49,710
I lived in Washington heights for a year.

32
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,060
Worst Year of my life.

33
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,690
Why?

34
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,950
Just the worst year of my life.

35
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:53,071
I,

36
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:54,300
I wasn't ready as a comedian.

37
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,200
Um,

38
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,980
how old were you?

39
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,490
20.

40
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,323
Oh yeah.

41
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,980
I'd only been doing it like three years.

42
00:00:58,981 --> 00:00:59,140
I,

43
00:00:59,140 --> 00:00:59,431
you know,

44
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:02,670
I didn't have been doing it three
years by the time I started at 17 Beta.

45
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,240
We're just start Orlando powerful and
Lando produced a couple of good things and

46
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:09,354
uh,

47
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,050
uh,

48
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:10,501
anyway,

49
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:11,334
so

50
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,750
I always swore if I ever had any money
I would live in New York was style.

51
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,510
So when my Sitcom was finished,

52
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,130
a 98,

53
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:23,641
99,

54
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:27,060
I moved to New York City and I got a
rock star apartment in the Wall Street

55
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:27,510
area.

56
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:27,781
Oh,

57
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:29,150
you did not consider it.

58
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,250
One of the first skyscrapers
ever built a 20 stories tall.

59
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:34,590
It's at the entrance
of a were Wall Street.

60
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,790
The entrance of Wall Street.

61
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:36,740
It's trinity churches.

62
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:36,970
Right?

63
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,420
They're only on the 18th floor.

64
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:41,400
Where there marble balconies?

65
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,490
I had three marble balconies.

66
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,670
I was on this corner unit,

67
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,140
just pimp spot.

68
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,721
Oh my God.

69
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:48,030
Three blocks from the World Trade Center.

70
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:48,860
Oh my goodness.

71
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,920
16 foot tall.

72
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,860
I could lie in my bed.

73
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,990
Look up at the World Trade Center.

74
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,950
Must've been insane.

75
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,271
It was,

76
00:01:56,271 --> 00:01:57,091
it was fantastic,

77
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:58,410
but it was a time in my life,

78
00:01:58,411 --> 00:01:58,621
you know,

79
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:00,450
the Sitcom had ended.

80
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:00,641
I,

81
00:02:00,641 --> 00:02:02,130
I felt I was angry.

82
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,590
I was angry and I was,

83
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:04,951
I was,

84
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:07,680
I was searching for meaning and,

85
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:08,700
and uh,

86
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:12,390
what was important in life
and what was making you angry?

87
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,021
I just,

88
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:13,321
you know,

89
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:15,600
that I had the Sitcom
and it didn't work out.

90
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:16,321
And then I just,

91
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:16,561
you know,

92
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:20,400
I wanted to just go focus on being
a comedian and live in New York.

93
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,670
So the Dalai Lama was going to give
a speech for free in central park on

94
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:29,970
happiness for six months.

95
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:31,830
I had the flyer on my refrigerator.

96
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,540
Nothing in the world was going to make
me miss the Dalai Lama's speech on

97
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,374
happiness.

98
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,990
So the night before,

99
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,450
I'm headlining at Caroline's on Broadway
and there were these two Puerto Rican

100
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:50,451
lesbian strippers and they loved me and
they stuck around after the show and

101
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,910
they wanted to talk to me and we're high,

102
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,063
we're talking.

103
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,303
And then they,

104
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,470
they invited me out
with them and know what,

105
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,220
uh,

106
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,410
there was the queen
bee and the other girl,

107
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:04,390
the other girl was off limits
because she had a boyfriend.

108
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:05,710
I ain't give a fuck about the other girl.

109
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,800
It was all about the queen bee and the
other girl was in love with the Queen

110
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:09,250
Bee.

111
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,300
Cause she's making all the,

112
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,060
all the decisions and
making everything happen.

113
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,953
Wow.

114
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,730
So she,

115
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,620
the Queen Bee had a car.

116
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,630
We're driving down to
the village somewhere.

117
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:20,171
Uh,

118
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:21,460
they said they had ecstasy.

119
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:22,540
Do I want to do ecstasy?

120
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:22,901
And I'm like,

121
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:23,734
hell yeah.

122
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,390
We go to some lounge and we're
drinking Pinot Grigio on ice.

123
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:29,750
And I had never had Pinot Grigio.

124
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,421
My mother and I,

125
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:31,061
and to this day,

126
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:33,880
I love Pino Grigio cause it
reminds me of this evening.

127
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,560
It's a perfect,

128
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,131
uh,

129
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:36,311
you know,

130
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:36,971
like red wine.

131
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:37,370
Is it all,

132
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:37,600
you know,

133
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,051
autumn,

134
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:38,980
winter thing.

135
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:39,551
Uh,

136
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:39,821
but,

137
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:42,160
but a dry white wine,

138
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,200
like a Pinot Grigio is great in summer.

139
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,810
So we're in,

140
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,510
you know,

141
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,700
we're drinking and we're
having a great time.

142
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,361
And,

143
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:49,631
uh,

144
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:49,931
you know,

145
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:50,950
after about an hour,

146
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,311
you know,

147
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:54,400
this ecstasy starts
thumping and this girl,

148
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,200
the queen bee wanted to
go to some dance club.

149
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,790
We go to some dance club in Soho.

150
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,660
It's packed.

151
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,430
I didn't want to be a packed dance club.

152
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,510
I want to be with these girls.

153
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,640
She knew the DJ.

154
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,140
We get up these steps were in
this private area behind the DJ.

155
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:09,370
No one can see us,

156
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,630
the Djs like 10,

157
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:14,290
15 feet in front of us just like jamming
and the place is packed downstairs but

158
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,190
you can't see them.

159
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,870
And we got this horse shoe leather couch
and we're just rocking and she's got

160
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:23,530
more bottles of Pinot Grigio and ice and
we're just fucking dancing and grinding

161
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:24,364
on each other.

162
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,960
And we go back to my apartment and
about five o'clock in the morning,

163
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:29,741
something like that.

164
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:30,011
And you know,

165
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:35,011
we dance on my furniture and we'll play
music and stuff and we got in my bed and

166
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:36,790
honestly there was no sex.

167
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,283
Uh,

168
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,620
we had our bottoms underwear on and
it was so tender and just resting and

169
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:49,630
kissing and tasting of fleshing
and touching of private areas.

170
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,830
And the,

171
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,120
at one point the queen bee got up on
her knees and she starts French kissing

172
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:00,580
this other girl and
she's rubbing her mound.

173
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:00,731
What?

174
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:01,570
She's just kissing her.

175
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,250
And I got behind this,

176
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,400
uh,

177
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,400
behind the Queen Bee and I just start
kissing this big beautiful brown bulbous

178
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,893
acid.

179
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,890
Hmm.

180
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,520
I got my hands up on the top curvature
of it and I pulled her panties aside,

181
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:21,100
them stuck my nose in our honeypot and
I'm just tasting these delicious flesh

182
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:23,200
rose petals and,

183
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:24,034
um,

184
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,050
I overslept and I missed
the Dalai Lama's speech.

185
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,170
When you,

186
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,810
when you,

187
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,643
why would you,

188
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,650
why would you even think that
that would be a bad thing?

189
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,300
The Dalai Lama is a true story,

190
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,870
but it's not a joke.

191
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:45,200
It's actually a true story story.

192
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,480
The Dalai Lama represents a,

193
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,270
an interesting point
of view and that's it.

194
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:49,871
You know,

195
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:53,600
the idea that this guy's guy
for define what happiness is.

196
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:54,630
The I,

197
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,080
it's the idea of a one uh,

198
00:05:57,081 --> 00:06:02,030
one figurehead like that is kind of
preposterous to the idea of enlightenment.

199
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:02,864
The idea,

200
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,110
especially if you're dealing with a guy
who dresses like a wizard and doesn't

201
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:06,590
fuck.
