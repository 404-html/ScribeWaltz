1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,130
Jon jones.

2
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:06,060
First heavyweight fight.

3
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:06,894
Brock Lesnar,

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,321

5
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:08,440

6
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:08,700
Bom,

7
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,533
Bom,

8
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,300
Bom,

9
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:10,860
Bom,

10
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,250
Bom,

11
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:11,491
Bom,

12
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:11,810

13
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:12,040
Yeah.

14
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,710
Imagine that fight the only problem.

15
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,413
Did you think so?

16
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,230
Yes.

17
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,480
I think you're just completely
died in fucking steel.

18
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:21,430
Brick would fucking ratchet pissed.

19
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:27,350
Pissed that go off in Cleveland and
he'll fuck Brock Lesnar because it'll say

20
00:00:27,351 --> 00:00:27,690
it.

21
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,310
You better do the fucking steroids.

22
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,300
Feel pick is crazy,

23
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,690
mother fucker.

24
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:32,341
Yo Yo chick.

25
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:33,060
I love him.

26
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,640
I love him to immigrant mentality.

27
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,483
Bring him on.

28
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,310
Give him more fucking steroid.

29
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:39,144
What's that you another?

30
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:39,860
Yeah,

31
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,630
whatever the fuck.

32
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,500
He definitely born in Cleveland,

33
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:43,861
Ohio,

34
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:46,320
but when it's got that
fucking crazy blood in them,

35
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,870
put him in there with a guide.

36
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,030
I know.

37
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:50,920
Fuck my car.

38
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:52,231
Oh No.

39
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:53,110
I think Steve Bay beach.

40
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,590
You know what the biggest
embarrassment log?

41
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,770
That would be a crazy,

42
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,730
the biggest fucking embarrassment of
the year that brought was embarrassing.

43
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,700
It's just embarrassing.

44
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:00,880
I,

45
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,713
it's Mark Hunt.

46
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,400
They put him in there with a guy
that's coming off rocket fucking fuel.

47
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,320
That dude don't jumped on the ball.

48
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,790
What is the size of his fucking head?

49
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,340
He's taking shit that makes
your fucking head grow.

50
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,340
Get the fucking pit bulls.

51
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,970
I hope they put them against my yo.

52
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:16,350
Check.

53
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,700
I will fly to fucking
clean back damage climate.

54
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,593
Amen.

55
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,870
I found the snot in my nose.

56
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:22,770
It was bigger than this gum.

57
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:24,240
The aid that I take the gum out to eat.

58
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,153
It

59
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,291
was so long.

60
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,130
It was like a cook book.

61
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:32,850
I got a flashback from the
hell that motherfucker anyway.

62
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:33,840
Oh booger.

63
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,733
Cause I love him.

64
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,331
I love him.

65
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:37,810
From time to time I have a little pimple

66
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,520
and it's got like a little clam board
with you with all this shit from time to

67
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:49,060
time.

68
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,590
Oh,

69
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,011
when you eat,

70
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:51,300
when you do code for 30 years,

71
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:51,820
it's a habit.

72
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,630
You wake up in the morning,

73
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,463
pick one out.

74
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,990
It's like candy cane with coke gossip.

75
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,570
You inhale that motherfucker.

76
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,010
It's like going to the dentist for free.

77
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,380
I will throw up on this fucking table.

78
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,570
Do you ever do feel like his
boogers and you know what man?

79
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,500
Go ahead.

80
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,700
Keep doing those steroids.

81
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:09,534
Put them in there against

82
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,200
Cleveland motherfucker.

83
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,123
Dude,

84
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:14,750
kill him.
