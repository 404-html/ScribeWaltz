1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,360
Five four,
three,

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,950
two,
one,

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:06,960
boom.
And we're off.

00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:07,980
What's up brother?
How are Ya?

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,701
Good,
good.

6
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:10,740
Thanks for having me on my pleasure.
Nice to meet you,

7
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:11,700
man.
You know,

8
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:12,534
it's,
it's funny that you just brought up 

9
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:14,910
doctor a Tia.
You know,

10
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:15,721
when we were,
we were,

11
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:18,120
you were saying that you download the 
podcast.

12
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:20,030
You were saying,
I got to get that guy on.

13
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,761
Yeah,
yeah.

14
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:23,730
It was funny.
I was auto downloads and that one popped

15
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:25,860
up and I remember thinking about a week 
before that I was like,

16
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:26,670
well,
when I,

17
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,960
when we first scheduled this one,
I was like,

18
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:28,803
I told Joel about Doctor [inaudible].
He was one of the kind of first guys I 

19
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:32,184
really followed when I kind of dove in 
10 of the high fat approach to 

20
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,570
nutrition.
So,

21
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:37,021
um,
yeah,

22
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:39,270
he's a fascinating guy who was a great,
listen,

23
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,740
I had to listen to it like twice.

24
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,920
Yeah.
He's a weird guy.

25
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:44,170
He's one of those guys.
We talked to them and you think,

26
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,130
oh,
this is a good,

27
00:00:45,131 --> 00:00:46,630
normal,
really nice guy.

28
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,570
And then as he starts getting into the 
medical aspect of things,

29
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:50,560
you go,
oh,

30
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:52,180
okay.
You're a fucking super genius.

31
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,031
Yeah.
Yeah.

32
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:54,290
He's tricks you.
Yeah.

33
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,363
I remember one of the first things he 
ever said that really kind of resonated 

34
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:01,280
with me was I think someone was asking 
him about like,

35
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:02,114
what the facts are or where the key to 
genic die in terms of like micro 

36
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:04,984
nutrients and what maybe he'd be missing
based on kind of like that normal 

37
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:10,580
profile of what you're supposed to get.
And he was just like,

38
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:11,250
you know,
it's,

39
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,530
it's interesting because most of those 
studies in recommendations are based off

40
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:18,950
of basically a standard American diet or
higher carb Diet.

41
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:20,270
So he's like,
well,

42
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:22,850
you might not need the same,
we need to do more.

43
00:01:22,851 --> 00:01:25,250
And he's always looking to kind of push 
the envelope a bit.

44
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,440
So cool guests for sure.

45
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,460
Yeah.
And you know,

46
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,533
I'm fascinated by you and I'm fascinated
by anybody who does the kind of shit 

47
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:36,320
that you do.
I mean,

48
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,523
please explain to people all the 
different ultra marathons you've done 

49
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,620
and what you've accomplished.

50
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:44,960
Yeah.
You know,

51
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,180
it's,
it's interesting because like,

52
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,900
I still kind of see myself as a pretty 
average runner because like,

53
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,273
um,
I mean I competed in high school and 

54
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:55,820
made state cross country and state track
and that kind of thing,

55
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,380
um,
for a small school.

56
00:01:57,381 --> 00:01:59,540
And then I went to a small division 
three school and was,

57
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,130
you know,
pretty much,

58
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,053
you know,
average amongst a real good program at 

59
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:04,220
the d three level.
And,

60
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,383
uh,
I always just did kind of like running 

61
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:08,390
longer though.
So,

62
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,940
um,
like once I got done with college,

63
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:11,870
I kind of decided,
well,

64
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:13,460
let's,
let's see what's longer than that.

65
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:14,294
Some of those traditional like 
collegiate races have like five k to 10 

66
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:20,660
kilometers and a,
and I started kind of just dabbling that

67
00:02:20,661 --> 00:02:22,880
stuff.
And then in 2010,

68
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:25,430
I think I actually did my first ultra 
marathon,

69
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,653
you know,
partly because I was just like looking 

70
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,720
around and there turned out to be one in
the state.

71
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,553
I was,
I was living in Wisconsin at the time 

72
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,451
and,
uh,

73
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:33,840
there was one that,
uh,

74
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,753
was kind of in my neck of the woods and 
I actually had just decided to go back 

75
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:40,550
to Grad school and that one had a 
thousand dollar prize purse on it.

76
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:41,211
And I was like,
you know what,

77
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:42,890
if I,
if I can win that thousand bucks,

78
00:02:42,891 --> 00:02:47,240
go a long way during Grad school.
So I did that one and I ended up winning

79
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:48,500
it and it,
uh,

80
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,334
it definitely hooked me.
It was like the type of thing where I 

81
00:02:51,231 --> 00:02:52,580
was like,
I want to do more of these.

82
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:53,620
And,
um,

83
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,613
by 2011,
I kind of jumped all lane at the end of 

84
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,973
the year and ended at three 50.
And I think it was about a nine week 

85
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,830
timeframe.
And,

86
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:04,300
uh,
it's so crazy.

87
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,621
Yeah.
And I mean,

88
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:06,640
it gets crazier.
There's,

89
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:07,810
there's some freaks out there.

90
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,590
There's guys who will do like a couple 
and the weekend and stuff like that.

91
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:12,780
So,
I mean,

92
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,810
it's,
it never ends.

93
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,040
Um,
but yeah,

94
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:15,874
you know,
it was one of those things where after 

95
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:19,630
that I was totally hooked.
So what is it that got you hooked?

96
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,550
Um,
you know,

97
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,370
it had to be partly just a little bit of
success.

98
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,280
You know,
I wasn't necessarily used to winning.

99
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,143
So like,
I mean I've had good races and good 

100
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:33,190
times relative to what you probably see 
like in an average person.

101
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:34,024
But you know,
when I went to like a competitive 5k 

102
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,270
competitive marathon or something like 
that,

103
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,411
um,
you know,

104
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:40,870
I wasn't going to win unless it was kind
of a local race.

105
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,760
So kind of finding,
you know,

106
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:43,594
it's like anything,
I guess you kind of gravitate to what 

107
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,980
you feel you're good at and then that 
kind of Piques your interest.

108
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,320
Um,
so that was part of it.

109
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:54,070
The other part was just I really enjoyed
doing the long run.

110
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,110
Like when you break up kind of like a 
training week,

111
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,790
you can have like a variety of different
things.

112
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,200
You've got like kind of,
you know,

113
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:00,034
base level runs,
you've got specific workouts for the 

114
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:02,764
distance and then most training programs
are going to have a long run once a 

115
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:06,424
week.
And that was the one that was always my 

116
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:10,360
favorite.
So wrapping my head around doing a bunch

117
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:13,780
of those a week instead of just one was,
was really it kind of appealing to me.

118
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:16,690
And when you're putting that much time 
into whatever you're training for,

119
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:18,220
it's,
I think important to enjoy it.

120
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:19,054
So being able to kind of enjoy the 
training process a lot was really 

121
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,680
appealing to me.
Um,

122
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,203
and uh,
and then it's just the variables when 

123
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:27,874
you're out there for that long,
there's so many variables to consider 

124
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:33,490
and it's like,
it's a blast for me to kind of like work

125
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:35,740
through those,
plan for those and then adjusted them on

126
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:37,060
the fly when you're out there and,
you know,

127
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,330
things inevitably go wrong or things pop
up that you didn't expect.

128
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,620
So it's,
it's,

129
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:42,850
uh,
it's just,

130
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:43,350
uh,
it's,

131
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,370
it's kind of hard to explain,
but it's,

132
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,473
it's weird.
One of the things in ultra marathon 

133
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:48,820
running that people will always say is 
like,

134
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,770
they'll have a race and even if they 
have a bad race,

135
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,600
say like,
I'm never doing one of these again.

136
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:54,130
And then the next day they're on,
uh,

137
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,660
on the Internet looking for another 
race.

138
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:59,080
So it's this weird thing about it that 
you don't really know until you do it,

139
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:00,890
but it,
it sucks you in.

140
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,820
That's the case with a lot of people 
only talk about things that are like,

141
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,920
they have to suffer through.
You know,

142
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,010
I've heard that when guys talk about 
like those extreme hikes,

143
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,060
you know,
when they,

144
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:11,170
you know,
like they do that,

145
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,273
you know,
that one that goes from Georgia all the 

146
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:15,820
way to Maine,
you know that it's insane.

147
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,740
Like what does that call the Appalachian
trail?

148
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,430
Yep.
Yeah.

149
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,930
Did they say,
I've never fucking do that again.

150
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,951
And then they're like,
okay,

151
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:22,360
what other,
what other hikes can I go?

152
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:26,230
It's just once the pain,
the physical pain dies down.

153
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:27,064
There's something about that challenge 
that stimulates in people like you and 

154
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:34,630
people that are into these really long 
distance things.

155
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,890
Like there's something about distance,
there's something about like,

156
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,893
like you were saying like you weren't 
the best runner in high school or 

157
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,310
college,
right?

158
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,240
But there's something about the mind of 
an ultra marathoner.

159
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:48,300
It's a different mind.
The purse,

160
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,740
the type of person that can run a 
hundred miles,

161
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:52,720
200 miles,
238 miles,

162
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,520
those type of people,
they're different people.

163
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,350
And there's like,
there's a strength,

164
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,490
a mental strength in the ability

165
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,510
to just keep going on and on and on.
That I'm absolutely fascinated with.

166
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,411
Yeah.
You know,

167
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:05,340
it is interesting too,
because it's a,

168
00:06:05,341 --> 00:06:08,150
in the sport's grown a bit,
quite a bit in the last decade or so,

169
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:10,550
but it's still very much kind of a niche
group.

170
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:12,140
And then when you kind of hang out in 
that group,

171
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:13,580
you start to kind of normalize it a 
little bit,

172
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,980
I think.
So then you start thinking like,

173
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:16,761
oh,
a hundred miles,

174
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:18,830
it's just what we do.
And then you,

175
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:19,664
you know,
he actually tried to like separate 

176
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:21,524
yourself from the fact that you've done 
a few of those are separate yourself 

177
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:24,884
from the fact that you've been hanging 
out with other people who are doing it 

178
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:27,051
and you realize,
oh,

179
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:30,410
this is actually kind of a weird thing 
to kind of do as,

180
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,170
as a human nowadays.
It's very weird.

181
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,850
How many of these things of you?

182
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,030
One,
uh,

183
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,630
I don't know how many I've won it.
It's,

184
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,300
I think I've done just shy of 50 total 
now.

185
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,381
Um,
you know,

186
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:45,800
everything from 50 kilometers to the 
furthest I've done is 200 kilometers,

187
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:48,500
which is about 125 miles.
Um,

188
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,700
yeah,
I,

189
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,320
I'd have to look to see how many I've 
won.

190
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:51,721
It's,
it's,

191
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:52,554
it's,
it's really goofy cause when you start 

192
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:56,480
getting into the longer stuff,
like a hundred miles and beyond,

193
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,000
you start,
at least in my training program,

194
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,870
you start to kind of pick smaller races 
to kind of use as training runs.

195
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,033
Um,
and some of it I think is just because 

196
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,103
for me,
if I'm going to go out and do like a 30 

197
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:09,860
mile or 40 mile training run or 
something like that,

198
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,023
it's kind of tedious to do that by 
herself and then plan all the logistics 

199
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:14,204
of it.
So if there's a race nearby and that's 

200
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:19,130
not too hard to get to,
it's easy just to sign up for that,

201
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,003
go and do that.

202
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,530
So some of those,
you know,

203
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:22,760
I'll,
I'll win if they're,

204
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,833
if they're small enough,
even though I'm not necessarily trying 

205
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:26,830
to go forward,
you know,

206
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,660
go all out so to speak,
cause I'm hoping to recover kind of and,

207
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,250
and get back into training.
Um,

208
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,240
you'll pace yourself at one of these 
local races maybe.

209
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:35,871
Yeah.
You know,

210
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:37,820
the way I described it is,
um,

211
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,683
and this is,
this is a real hard thing for a lot of 

212
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:40,910
people to do.
I think it's a,

213
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:41,803
like you go into a race saying this is 
going to be a moderately difficult long 

214
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:46,994
run.
Uh,

215
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,340
so maybe a little faster than what I 
would do if I was just going to do it by

216
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:51,230
myself,
like on supported,

217
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:54,950
that sort of thing.
And then I always tell myself 80% is the

218
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:55,784
hardest you can go if you want to be 
able to come back and start training on 

219
00:07:58,431 --> 00:08:00,530
time to meet the actual goal or the 
race.

220
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,840
Um,
so when I do those,

221
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:04,490
it's like,
it's one of those things where like,

222
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,241
you know,
who knows,

223
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:06,074
someone might show up that's,
that's like as fast as you or maybe a 

224
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:09,824
little slower than your normal.
And if they're deciding to just hammer 

225
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:12,794
it that day,
they might beat you and you gotta be 

226
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:15,350
okay with that.
Um,

227
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,500
the competitive part of you flare up 
though?

228
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,261
Well,
yeah,

229
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:19,520
it does.
And that's the hardest part.

230
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:20,354
And that's,
I think the main reason why some people 

231
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:25,040
won't do that approach because there are
certainly people who just,

232
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:28,100
they stay away from races and less,
it's there a race and they just say,

233
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:29,330
I'm,
if I'm going to do a long run,

234
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:31,080
I'll do it on my own and,
and,

235
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:31,491
and,
you know,

236
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:32,480
not do that.
Or,

237
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,800
you know,
there's certainly,

238
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,663
I'm sure folks who do it and then they'd
get caught up and then ended up leaving 

239
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:39,860
there a race out on,
on the b race,

240
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:40,880
I guess,
so to speak.

241
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:42,260
So,
um,

242
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,460
yeah,
it's interesting.

243
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,323
It's,
uh,

244
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,343
it's kind of a,
a sport that I think is still a lot to 

245
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:50,570
learn,
which I think is actually the case for a

246
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,180
lot of things that,
you know,

247
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,500
even things that are well established,
you know,

248
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,010
there's always something to learn

249
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,020
or new things to pick up on.
Well,

250
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:59,300
it's one of those things,
right when we went,

251
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,490
once someone runs a hundred miles and 
then a bunch of other people start doing

252
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:03,290
it,
like you said,

253
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,123
it almost becomes normalized and then 
people start to try to push that 

254
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,970
boundary.
Now I've been hearing,

255
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:12,390
talk about the woman candace who runs 
the Moab to 40.

256
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:13,050
Yeah,
yeah.

257
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,530
They're talking about doing a 500 I 
heard that.

258
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:16,981
I was like,
here,

259
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:19,050
you're out of your fucking mind.
People are going to die,

260
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,283
but maybe that'd be normal in five years
and we'll get used to like four or five 

261
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:24,490
day races.
Yes.

262
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,493
So it's really fascinating.
It took me a couple of years to do this 

263
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:28,044
before I got into the sport,
but once I was in it for a couple of 

264
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,840
years,
I kind of did a little,

265
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,973
a little,
a little research to see like what the 

266
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:33,690
deal was with them.

267
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,970
Some of this stuff.
And the,

268
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:39,660
the funny thing is that type of a 
distance isn't even unheard of.

269
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,690
They actually,
I forget what the book is called,

270
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,170
but they actually had in Madison Square 
Garden,

271
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,570
they used to host a six day event where 
guys and Gals,

272
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,760
I'm not sure if gals were doing it back 
then,

273
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:51,594
but um,
guys for sure we're going there and 

274
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:55,770
seeing how far they could run in six 
days.

275
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,260
And uh,
yeah,

276
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,160
I know crazy.
And uh,

277
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,350
I think if I remember right,
they would actually,

278
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,020
people were betting on them that way and
so they'd fill it up.

279
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,270
Like people would come and watch us like
spectacle.

280
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,270
It was in the late 18 hundreds I think 
is when they started it.

281
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:10,260
I'm not sure.
Oh,

282
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,110
here it is.
Six Day cycling,

283
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,860
the six day grind at Madison Square 
Garden Valley ranch.

284
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:17,843
Oh Wow.
Look at this map to some crazy person 

285
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:20,640
decided to leave the bike at home.

286
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,870
I guess this is super old.
We're looking at this on youtube folks.

287
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:25,704
It says six day cycling,
the six day grind at Madison Square 

288
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,053
Garden,
and so it's just a track and these 

289
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:34,950
people are,
this is old timey shit.

290
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,200
This looks like the 30s right.
That guy just went down and so they're,

291
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,450
they're just riding their bike for six 
days.

292
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,130
Oh Shit.
When they wipe out.

293
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,533
Oh my God,
they probably a terrible breaks back 

294
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:48,421
then,
right?

295
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:51,480
Yeah.
That was their feet probably right,

296
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,240
or the railing.
Yeah.

297
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,250
Yeah.
So this is so endurance sports like this

298
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:57,570
or nothing new.
Yeah.

299
00:10:57,571 --> 00:11:01,350
It's actually fascinating when you like 
kind of look into it because nowadays in

300
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:02,184
the United States,
the trail running scene is definitely 

301
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:05,850
way bigger than like the road running or
certainly the track,

302
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,010
the track scene,
but that wasn't always the case.

303
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:08,844
If you look back and be like the 70s and
eighties there was a pretty big surge 

304
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:13,860
and ultra marathon running a for flat 
bass stuff.

305
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,290
That's where we see a lot of the,
the records coming from.

306
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,453
Um,
so that's like a track and you run as 

307
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:23,280
far and long as you can on a track like 
track or a road or really flat road.

308
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,060
I had goggins on David Gardner.
Yeah.

309
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,650
And he was talking about the first time 
he did one was on a track.

310
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,960
Okay.
Ran In circles on a track,

311
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:31,794
which is almost got to be more taxing 
for your mind cause you're just seeing 

312
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,200
the same shit over and over and over 
again.

313
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,393
Yeah.
It's really fascinating because I've 

314
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:40,380
done,
I've done both.

315
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:41,214
I've done a hundred miles on the trail 
and I've done a hundred miles on a 400 

316
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:44,850
meter track.
And uh,

317
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,160
the fascinating thing is it is like what
you said,

318
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:51,120
it's almost a different event where 
mentally you're doing everything you can

319
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:54,220
on that track to kind of separate 
yourself from the actual

320
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,560
environment and envision yourself being 
somewhere else.

321
00:11:56,561 --> 00:11:57,394
You know,
looking forward a little things to kind 

322
00:11:58,331 --> 00:11:59,164
of not necessarily be thinking too far 
and advanced cause that can get 

323
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:03,910
overwhelming.
Whereas when I'm out on the trails,

324
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:06,160
it's like you're using a pretty 
pristine,

325
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:09,670
beautiful area and you can kind of just 
take it as it comes and say,

326
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:10,990
Oh cool,
now I get to see that,

327
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:13,300
or this is a neat area,
or I like this section.

328
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:14,134
And you look,
you look forward to that kind of 

329
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,440
diversity.
Whereas on the track it's,

330
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,180
you know,
you see it once and you've seen it every

331
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:20,170
time.
Um,

332
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,721
and then it,
you know,

333
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:24,250
it just kind of beats you up mentally 
from that side of things.

334
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,450
Um,
but then,

335
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:26,284
you know,
there's other things about that too 

336
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:27,970
that,
that help out.

337
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:28,804
Like logistically,
when you're on a track for foreigner 

338
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,780
meters,
you bring out one person,

339
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,030
you put everything you might possibly 
want on a little table.

340
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,740
And if I want something,
I say,

341
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:37,210
Hey,
can I get that 400 numbers later?

342
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:38,044
I have it.
And even,

343
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,750
even if we mess it up,
I'll get it 400 years after that.

344
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:42,730
So yeah,
we're,

345
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,121
whereas,
you know,

346
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:44,050
the trails,
it depends.

347
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:46,660
They've gotten a lot better with aid 
stations as the sport's grown.

348
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,440
Um,
but like,

349
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,413
you know,
you mess up your aid station or if you 

350
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:51,364
get caught up in the moment and just 
blow through it and don't take care of 

351
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:53,914
yourself,
you might have to suffer for an hour 

352
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:57,970
plus before you get help again.
So that's where it kind of gets a little

353
00:12:57,971 --> 00:12:58,804
different I think logistically when 
you're on the trails versus versus on 

354
00:13:01,691 --> 00:13:03,310
the road.
And um,

355
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,540
but,
but yeah,

356
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,070
it's,
it's kind of a different thing.

357
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,323
The track is interesting too in the 
sense that you're essentially making 

358
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:12,820
that same exact motion,
exact motion,

359
00:13:12,821 --> 00:13:13,654
the whole way.

360
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,600
So like there's certain areas of your 
body that fatigue,

361
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,813
um,
and they don't get a break on the turn 

362
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:21,730
and just running flat,
like running flat.

363
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:22,564
You're going to kind of localize some of
the way you stimulate your muscles or 

364
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:27,670
your gate is going to be pretty similar 
throughout.

365
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,863
Whereas when you're on the trails,
like you might be going on a slight 

366
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,510
incline,
a steep incline,

367
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,370
slight decline,
a little bit of flat,

368
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:35,200
some rolling and all kinds of things in 
between.

369
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,300
And then trails can be kind of 
undulating.

370
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:38,134
So you're just kind of moving all that 
force is around your legs a little more 

371
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:43,240
than you would be when you're running on
a flat surface.

372
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,500
So,
you know,

373
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:47,320
it's one of the things that I always 
tell like my coaching clients and,

374
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:48,790
and myself when I'm planning for 
something,

375
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,370
it's like if you really want to meet 
your full potential,

376
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:52,810
like specificity is king.

377
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,033
You need to be on that environment in 
the environment you're going to race on 

378
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:59,240
and really get your body used to kind of
that type of a motion.

379
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,193
And um,
it makes it a little more interesting 

380
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:02,584
when you're doing a track race cause 
that means some kind of long runs on a 

381
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:05,434
track.
So,

382
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,593
um,
you're kind of balancing doing just 

383
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:08,314
enough to get ready for it and not doing
too much so that when you get to the 

384
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:11,440
race you're like,
screw this.

385
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:13,660
I've done too much of this already.
I don't want to see another loop.

386
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,000
Um,
that's kind of a,

387
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,470
an interesting concept.

388
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,870
It's,
it's interesting to me too that you're,

389
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,800
if you're planning to run a hundred 
miles,

390
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:25,160
like what you were saying about running 
these shorter races as a training run,

391
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,293
which makes sense because how else are 
you going to prepare for a hundred 

392
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,173
miles?
Like if he just decided to just go out 

393
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:32,930
and run a hundred miles,
you'd have to like map it out.

394
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:35,460
Like how far is a hundred miles?
Where am I going to park?

395
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,520
Where am I going to put water?

396
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,933
And Yeah.
And then people will also kind of get 

397
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:41,783
like,
forget about the aspect of just all the 

398
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,093
stuff surrounding the race that you can 
kind of fine tune when you're doing a 

399
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:48,780
race as a kind of training run where 
like,

400
00:14:48,781 --> 00:14:49,614
you know,
usually you're going to travel a little 

401
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:52,340
bit for stuff like,
um,

402
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,380
so you're probably going to stay in a 
hotel the night before you're going to,

403
00:14:55,381 --> 00:14:58,040
you have to wake up early in the morning
and have to get yours,

404
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,720
your,
your gear ready.

405
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:00,554
And so it's Kinda like going through 
that process of what you're gonna have 

406
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:05,780
to do on race day.
So then when you're big race comes up,

407
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:06,261
you're like,
okay,

408
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:08,390
I've done this three or four times in 
the last six months,

409
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:09,860
so I know what I'm doing

410
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,423
now.
What's different between you and a lot 

411
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,124
of guys,
and this is one of the reasons why I 

412
00:15:14,851 --> 00:15:16,810
wanted to talk to you about this,
is that you,

413
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,220
you are on a fat burning diet.
You're essentially,

414
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,790
you're on a ketogenic diet and running 
these races.

415
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:24,581
Yeah.
You know,

416
00:15:24,581 --> 00:15:25,414
it's,
it's a little interesting because the 

417
00:15:27,341 --> 00:15:30,220
way I kind of the,
at least the way I came into it,

418
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,054
like I explored the ketogenic diet 
mainly because I started noticing some 

419
00:15:34,361 --> 00:15:35,230
things.
Oh,

420
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:36,220
sorry.
No worries.

421
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,241
Yeah.
Yeah.

422
00:15:37,241 --> 00:15:42,241
So I started kind of exploring the 
ketogenic diet back in late 2011 because

423
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:43,624
I started noticing some,
some goofy things going on with my body 

424
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:47,350
from,
from the,

425
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,450
from the high level of training and 
then,

426
00:15:49,451 --> 00:15:50,760
and then the racing.
And um,

427
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,783
that was right around that same time I 
did those three 50 milers and nine 

428
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,090
notice.
Uh,

429
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,480
I would wake up like three or four times
at night and then like,

430
00:15:58,481 --> 00:15:59,314
I'd have to like pee all the time at 
night and I'd have like swelling in my 

431
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:02,824
ankles and stuff a lot.
I'll just like huge energy swings 

432
00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:06,790
throughout the day.
Like I would,

433
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:07,721
you know,
I was,

434
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:11,560
I was a teacher at the time,
so I remember thinking like every day at

435
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:13,720
like one or two o'clock,
I could have laid down and take a nap on

436
00:16:13,721 --> 00:16:15,850
spot if I had had the opportunity to.

437
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:16,923
So it was just like a lot of weird 
things that I thought was pretty 

438
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,970
abnormal for 25 year old male at the 
time.

439
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,353
Um,
and so it was kind of becoming clear to 

440
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:27,694
me that what I was doing was either 
unsustainable or the way I was doing it 

441
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,440
was unsustainable.
And you know,

442
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:37,030
I was really intrigued by the sport and 
I didn't really want to necessarily back

443
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:37,864
off of that if I didn't have to.
So that's when I kind of started to 

444
00:16:39,941 --> 00:16:42,160
explore nutrition and diet and things 
like that.

445
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:43,220
And,
um,

446
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,523
I was very much following what I would 
have considered a healthy diet before 

447
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,490
that.
At the time it was,

448
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,353
it was high carbohydrate,
but it was like what you would think of 

449
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:54,790
as a healthy high carbohydrate diet with
like what was a normal meal.

450
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,571
Um,
you know,

451
00:16:55,571 --> 00:17:00,430
I wake up and I usually go for a run and
then have like some oatmeal,

452
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:02,770
raisins,
maybe some fruit or something like that,

453
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,900
some,
some eggs or something with,

454
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:06,040
with that in the morning.

455
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,840
So not junk food,
just know it was clean.

456
00:17:07,841 --> 00:17:08,710
It was like clean,
like,

457
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:09,790
you know,
you know what you say,

458
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,500
they say like get your whole grains,
fruits,

459
00:17:11,501 --> 00:17:12,520
vegetables,
that sort of thing.

460
00:17:12,521 --> 00:17:13,790
I definitely,
you know,

461
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,330
focused heavily on that and made sure I 
wasn't eating like junk,

462
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,253
junk food.
I wasn't going through fast food 

463
00:17:17,951 --> 00:17:21,430
restaurants or eating oreos and bond 
bonds and that sort of thing.

464
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:22,690
So,
um,

465
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,000
so it was kinda interesting to me to 
think like,

466
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:25,834
okay,
I didn't really realize that it was 

467
00:17:27,761 --> 00:17:31,150
necessarily the nutritional side of 
things.

468
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,051
Like,
it wasn't,

469
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,060
it wasn't like a big slap in the face 
and the sense that,

470
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,510
oh,
I just got to cut out the junk.

471
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,560
Cause like according to most people,
I wasn't eating junk.

472
00:17:38,561 --> 00:17:41,020
I was eating really good food.
Um,

473
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,490
so,
you know,

474
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,530
that's when I Kinda got introduced to 
some folks,

475
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:48,070
like a doctor Valek and doctor Finney 
who were kind of,

476
00:17:48,071 --> 00:17:51,060
I guess,
I guess the pioneers of like the,

477
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,180
this latest way of,
of kind of the high fat approach.

478
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,830
And,
um,

479
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:56,940
you know,
they were,

480
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:57,923
I started reading their books,
listening to podcasts and things like 

481
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:00,450
that.
And,

482
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,410
and it,
you know,

483
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:02,244
it was interesting because I was,
I was training upwards of 20 hours a 

484
00:18:04,201 --> 00:18:05,470
week at the time.
And you know,

485
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,890
I started kind of thinking like,
uh,

486
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,580
how much time am I going to invest in,
in just running,

487
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,443
you know,
how can I kind of kill two birds with 

488
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:13,944
one stone?
And,

489
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,290
and that's kind of when I discovered 
podcasts and thought,

490
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,393
this is sweet.
I can learn something and train at the 

491
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:19,840
same time.
Um,

492
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:20,683
and so I just kind of like,
went all in on listening to a bunch of 

493
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:23,863
podcasts and stuff like that.
And I'm actually one of your previous 

494
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:27,090
guests.
Uh,

495
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:27,923
Ben Greenfield was one of the first 
podcasts I really kind of did a deep 

496
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:34,800
dive into and he was always kind of like
a ruling out stuff that was like kind of

497
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:36,870
new or cutting edge.
So like,

498
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,783
um,
he definitely had a lot of information 

499
00:18:39,271 --> 00:18:40,104
there.
And,

500
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,370
uh,
I was facing mania,

501
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,900
don't take his advice on what he does 
with his dick shooting stem.

502
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:48,810
So when it was dick,
he's turning himself into a Guinea pig,

503
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,190
but he's an odd duck.

504
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,033
But yeah,
he definitely had a lot of info from 

505
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,680
guys like Doctor Finian,
Doctor Walik and uh,

506
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,660
and I was lucky to meet those guys too 
on a couple occasions.

507
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:01,720
And,
um,

508
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,850
with,
with doctor Valek,

509
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:03,684
I've done some podcasts with him and 
certainly in like exchange emails and 

510
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:07,860
stuff when I've had questions.
And,

511
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,230
uh,
so I kind of just tested it out,

512
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,093
you know,
I was like,

513
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,750
what's the worst that can happen?
I can just,

514
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,890
I can always go back.
You know,

515
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:14,724
like it's not like I have to stick to 
this to for the rest of my life if it's 

516
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:17,274
not something your issues were swelling 
and energy and why did you attribute 

517
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:22,644
that to your diet?
Like what was making you think that as 

518
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,180
you'd died and that was doing that too.
Yeah.

519
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,460
So you know,
I wasn't sure.

520
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,413
I thought,
I thought for sure that something I was 

521
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:31,590
doing was wrong and get your blood work 
done,

522
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:33,300
check your hormone levels,
all that stuff.

523
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:33,930
Yeah.
You know,

524
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,763
I didn't have probably as much blood 
work done as I would've liked you to 

525
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:38,694
really be like look at stuff and see 
like the way I look at blood work is if 

526
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:42,504
you're doing it regularly,
like often enough and not changing 

527
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:45,324
things,
that's what you're going to see the 

528
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:47,940
most.
Cause you're going to see changes versus

529
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:48,960
just like,
oh,

530
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:52,170
I'm chronically low in this or I'm 
always low in this,

531
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:54,180
but it doesn't seem to be an issue.
Uh,

532
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,133
but you know,
there was no big red flags on my blood 

533
00:19:56,701 --> 00:19:57,534
work.
Like nothing that would have said said 

534
00:19:58,771 --> 00:20:00,410
like thyroid disease,
right.

535
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,460
Nothing,
nothing quite that wrong.

536
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:03,294
And you know,
it wasn't like the wheels were coming 

537
00:20:04,381 --> 00:20:05,850
off at that point.
There were,

538
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,480
these were small things that I kind of 
associated like nagging things.

539
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:10,314
They,
they were like things I could get 

540
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:11,754
through.

541
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,470
Um,
but they weren't ideal.

542
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,581
So,
you know,

543
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:15,414
I'm,
I've kind of been a curious person like 

544
00:20:16,711 --> 00:20:18,150
my whole life.
So I was,

545
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,253
um,
it was just looking to kind of optimize 

546
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:23,970
I guess more or less than,
and I didn't know if it was gonna work.

547
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:24,923
I was,
was terrified that I'd find out it 

548
00:20:28,351 --> 00:20:30,360
wasn't and then I would have to stop 
running as much.

549
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,553
And at the time I was like,
that doesn't sound like what I want to 

550
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:34,674
do.
So,

551
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:35,683
um,
this was just something I decided to 

552
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:38,700
explore first.
Um,

553
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,623
and it's,
it's really goofy because like I've 

554
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,300
certainly evolved and kind of how I use 
it from that.

555
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,560
When I first started,
when I,

556
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,453
when I first started,
I went like really kind of really low 

557
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:50,254
carb.
Like that clinical ketosis level where 

558
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,640
you read about where they're like 50 
grams of carbohydrates are last.

559
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,451
And,
you know,

560
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:56,284
I did that for about,
I think it was like four to six weeks 

561
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,800
and,
um,

562
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,970
I didn't have as hard of a time as what 
I think I've,

563
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,600
I've,
I've seen some people have with it.

564
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:06,100
You know,
you have people talking about everything

565
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:06,934
from what the Keto flu to just like 
feeling really lethargic for awhile 

566
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,190
before that kind of metabolic switch 
flips.

567
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,530
Um,
what I kind of noticed was,

568
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:15,783
um,
I felt really good doing like really 

569
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:18,274
like low level type mundane task,
just like day to day work and things 

570
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:25,240
like that.
But like maybe every second or third day

571
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:28,510
I'd go for a run and just feel awful.
And,

572
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,433
um,
I kind of knew enough about it that I 

573
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:32,310
thought,
okay,

574
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,193
let's give this a solid four weeks 
before I make any judgments on whether 

575
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:37,870
that's going to be something that sticks
around or not.

576
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,670
And you know,
after about that point,

577
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,160
my energy level's kind of normalized.
Um,

578
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,331
and then,
you know,

579
00:21:43,331 --> 00:21:44,980
I was,
so at that point I was like excited.

580
00:21:44,981 --> 00:21:47,200
I was like,
this is sweet and well,

581
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:48,034
I should have mentioned too,
like during that process I started 

582
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:51,274
sleeping through the night again,
which was like kind of really an eye 

583
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:56,440
opening thing for me.
Um,

584
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,230
because usually like I'd wake up at 
least three times.

585
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,450
What do you attribute that to?
Um,

586
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,733
you know,
I,

587
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,390
I don't know for sure of,
but,

588
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:05,260
uh,
you know,

589
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:06,094
it could be anything from just the 
amount of stress I was causing on my 

590
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:11,860
body from kind of two angles from the 
training plus like,

591
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,933
you know,
like I don't want to demonize 

592
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:16,000
carbohydrates because I think they have 
a place,

593
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,370
I think they're a great tool.
I just think like,

594
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,233
the,
the question everyone should ask is at 

595
00:22:20,801 --> 00:22:24,820
what level do they become kind of a 
margin to diminishing returns for you.

596
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,953
And you know,
what I think was likely happening is 

597
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:28,901
that,
you know,

598
00:22:28,901 --> 00:22:32,650
I was reaching past that margin at 
diminishing returns and,

599
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:33,484
um,
it was causing more stress than what my 

600
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:36,634
body was,
was able to tolerate and that was 

601
00:22:38,111 --> 00:22:40,060
causing cortisol spikes or something 
like that,

602
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,390
that was waking me up at night.
Um,

603
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,610
but you know,
who knows really like it's a,

604
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:49,390
it all I know is the only thing at that 
time I changed because my diet,

605
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,270
and we should probably point out that 
this is not universal,

606
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,150
that everybody's diet is going to affect
them differently for sure.

607
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,040
Fine with carbohydrates.
Use a lot of people out there that,

608
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,903
you know,
high carbohydrate diet and they have 

609
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:03,810
zero issues with it whatsoever.
And it's,

610
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,470
that's one of the weirdest things about 
people,

611
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,563
you know,
that we are so variable depending upon 

612
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:09,370
your ancestry,
you know,

613
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:10,960
what part of the world that they 
evolved.

614
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

615
00:23:12,131 --> 00:23:13,630
It's,
it's fascinating to me because I mean,

616
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:15,990
I'll look at,
folks are doing complete opposite of why

617
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,110
am and there they're doing just fine.
Um,

618
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,210
and it's,
you know,

619
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:23,260
then I'll look at some folks too that 
are doing the opposite of me and they're

620
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:24,094
doing just fine for a while and then 
they ultimately start noticing the same 

621
00:23:26,411 --> 00:23:28,660
kind of things I did and then they can 
clean it up.

622
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,840
Uh,
so it is kind of it,

623
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,190
I think at the end of the day you just 
gotta be kind of honest with yourself.

624
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:36,310
And you know,
some people I think are really,

625
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:37,144
really robust and they can,
they can hit their body with that high 

626
00:23:39,911 --> 00:23:44,260
octane fuel of carbohydrate like day in 
and day out at a high level.

627
00:23:44,261 --> 00:23:46,880
And it doesn't seem to bother him much.
But you know,

628
00:23:46,881 --> 00:23:49,560
other people I've yet think just that it
can kind of,

629
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,060
it's like playing with rocket fuel a 
little bit where you know,

630
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,903
a little bit can be great and not too 
much of it can kind of burn you up a 

631
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:55,490
little bit.

632
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:59,270
So you're saying that you started off at
like 50 grams of carbohydrates a day,

633
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,860
the grills trick,
Ketosis Diet,

634
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,150
what did you eventually move to?
Um,

635
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,290
it,
so the way I call,

636
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:09,080
as I peered eyes it,
so like when I look at my year,

637
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,243
you're,
you can pick out a week where I'm kind 

638
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:12,314
of in peak training and then pick out a 
week where I'm kind of in like a 

639
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:15,384
recovery phase or off season.
And it looks like two completely 

640
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:18,584
different lifestyles.
So my first thought after kind of like 

641
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:24,560
working through the cold ketogenic 
approach,

642
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,760
um,
cause I should add too,

643
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:26,594
like,
um,

644
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,800
once I got like feeling good about that,
I started adding back speed workouts and

645
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:31,634
things like that and I definitely 
noticed that I was missing kind of that 

646
00:24:33,381 --> 00:24:34,214
last year.
Like it was a lot more difficult to go 

647
00:24:36,531 --> 00:24:39,800
out and really throttle down.
Like I could run all day at a slow pace.

648
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,663
But if I decided to go out on the track 
and do like 400 meter repeats at like a 

649
00:24:43,761 --> 00:24:45,980
really fast,
like a really fast pace,

650
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,380
um,
it was really hard to kind of,

651
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,320
to be able to do that.
That's a common complaint.

652
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,240
Robb Wolf,
you know Rob,

653
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,083
Oh rob wolf had a similar issue.
He's gotten like very heavily into 

654
00:24:56,811 --> 00:24:57,644
Jujitsu and he was telling me that he 
just can't stick to that 50 grams of 

655
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:05,180
carbohydrates a day and still have the 
energy to go hard.

656
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,260
Does,
does,

657
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,270
do you notice robb wolf work out more 
than one time a day?

658
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,910
I do not know.
Um,

659
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,900
he looked very fit though.
I'm not sure what his,

660
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,120
uh,
what his schedule is,

661
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:17,090
but I know he works out very hard and if
he's doing Jujitsu,

662
00:25:17,091 --> 00:25:17,924
this is really,
it's very difficult to do Jujitsu any 

663
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:20,570
other way than hard.

664
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,433
Sure.
Yet he says one thing I've always been 

665
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,460
curious about too and you know,
I'm not,

666
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,353
I'm not trying to come,
come on here and say like everyone 

667
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:29,054
should switch to doing what I do.
I mean I think you should follow your 

668
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:32,144
own your own set,
your own personal self and if it'd be 

669
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:35,360
honest with yourself,
you feel great,

670
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:36,194
do what you're doing.
If you don't then probably look to 

671
00:25:37,131 --> 00:25:40,130
change something.
But like one thing I'm always looking at

672
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,973
nower suspecting is that like it's more 
about the recovery between efforts than 

673
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,244
it is about the intensity of the effort 
or the duration of the effort in terms 

674
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,790
of how much carbs you need to bring back
or want to bring back.

675
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:57,860
Because I've also had circumstances 
where like I'll do like a big workout or

676
00:25:57,861 --> 00:25:58,694
a race or something like that and then 
I'll go really easy for like a week and 

677
00:26:01,641 --> 00:26:03,950
during that week I'll go like super 
strict to Quito.

678
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,180
Um,
cause I'm recovering,

679
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm not doing anything intense,
I'm not doing anything too long.

680
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,410
Um,
so that's,

681
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,300
that's the point in my training where I 
kind of say,

682
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:12,134
all right,
let's get rid of the start the fast 

683
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:14,900
acting fuel sources.
I don't need them right now.

684
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,360
And reset that whole fat adaptation 
thing.

685
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,793
You feel like you,
the fast acting fuel sources of 

686
00:26:20,301 --> 00:26:21,134
carbohydrates,
you only really need them when you're 

687
00:26:22,551 --> 00:26:23,720
pushing hard,
right?

688
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,820
When you're really running fast.
Yeah.

689
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:26,654
And I actually think it's,
it's when you're doubling down on those 

690
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:30,314
on a regular basis.
So like if you're working out really 

691
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:34,820
hard for like 45 minutes to an hour a 
day,

692
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,833
I think you can probably get away with 
almost a ketogenic or like a really low 

693
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:38,834
carbohydrate approach because you're 
giving yourself like 23 plus hours 

694
00:26:41,661 --> 00:26:42,494
between sessions for your body to kind 
of a restock glycogen stores from other 

695
00:26:45,661 --> 00:26:46,080
areas.

696
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,913
Like,
you know,

697
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,630
from fat and proteins and things like 
that.

698
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,990
I think when you start getting into a 
system where you're like,

699
00:26:51,991 --> 00:26:53,490
myself,
I'm doing two days a lot,

700
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,070
and then sometimes one of those is a 
speed session.

701
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,800
That's when I feel like I need to bring 
some of the carbohydrate back.

702
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,680
And I think it's probably just to get 
some of the glycogen and a little faster

703
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:02,514
rate because that is going to replenish 
your glycogen stores faster as a 

704
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:07,320
carbohydrate then like a fat or a 
protein probably would.

705
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,200
So how many grams of carbohydrates to do
with having to deal with that?

706
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,020
Um,
when I'm in like peak training,

707
00:27:13,021 --> 00:27:13,854
which is about 20 hours a week of 
running strength training and mobility 

708
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:18,300
type stuff,
you know,

709
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:19,134
I'll probably let myself get up to like 
15 to 25% of my intake from 

710
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:27,360
carbohydrate.
Um,

711
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,760
what do you think that is in grams a 
flu?

712
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,220
It probably,
it depends a lot on like what I actually

713
00:27:32,221 --> 00:27:35,550
do because I don't count calories very 
often.

714
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:36,384
I used to just to Kinda like see what 
was going on and then I kinda got 

715
00:27:38,881 --> 00:27:40,530
intuitive with it.
Uh,

716
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,400
Graham Wise,
you know,

717
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:44,700
it's probably anywhere from like two to 
300 maybe.

718
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,490
And then when I'm in those phases of 
training,

719
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,670
it's really intense in terms of like 
just a,

720
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:51,504
or I shouldn't say intense,
it's just really tedious and the amount 

721
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:53,994
of time and energy required for it now 
or you blood monitoring at the time you 

722
00:27:57,721 --> 00:28:02,721
checking your millimolar?
I am sometimes like when I'm like,

723
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,660
when I get curious about that type of 
stuff or I've done it in the past.

724
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:11,010
I've actually,
what I did originally is I got the blood

725
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:14,280
ketone monitor and they also got one of 
those key tonics.

726
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,020
But like it's like this little usb thing
and then you blow into it.

727
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,620
And is that accurate?
Um,

728
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,950
I think there's,
I think there's varied results.

729
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,270
I think they've gotten a lot better with
it.

730
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,420
Um,
but what I did is I actually measured my

731
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:31,830
blood ketone and then I would use that 
and I tried to find kind of like if mine

732
00:28:31,831 --> 00:28:34,740
was matching what that thing would say.
So I kind of had an,

733
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,613
I got it to where I kind of had an idea 
of where certain ranges on that thing 

734
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,590
would kind of indicate whether I was in 
Ketosis or not.

735
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:41,843
Um,
so like I very much is coming out of 

736
00:28:44,281 --> 00:28:46,320
ketosis during peak training.
Like when I would,

737
00:28:46,321 --> 00:28:49,050
especially when I would get up to two,
300 grams of carbohydrate,

738
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,090
I would come out of ketosis.
Uh,

739
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,190
and I probably go back into ketosis 
throughout that,

740
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,063
for that phase.
And when you said go back in and come 

741
00:28:56,761 --> 00:28:57,594
out,
like what kind of time period are you 

742
00:28:59,041 --> 00:28:59,874
talking about?

743
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,180
Uh,
it,

744
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,330
the time period was more indicative 
about what I kind of ate during it too.

745
00:29:06,331 --> 00:29:08,050
Like if I did,
if,

746
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:11,430
if,
if I did or I shouldn't say what I like,

747
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,610
how I kind of structured those two to 
300 grams of carbohydrate.

748
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:16,860
Like if I did like a big bolus of it in 
one meal,

749
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,053
I'd get back into ketosis a little 
quicker because then I wouldn't come 

750
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:22,800
back to the carbohydrates again for a 
while.

751
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:25,350
Very inside the day.
Yeah.

752
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,401
Yeah.
Like,

753
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:27,234
I would still like if I,
and here's where it got kind of 

754
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:29,544
interesting I guess is I do a lot of my,
the heaviest bulk of my training in the 

755
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,253
morning.
So I typically wake up and have some 

756
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:39,450
coffee with like coconut milk or heavy 
whipping cream or something like that.

757
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:40,621
And then,
uh,

758
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:41,620
you know,
go for my run.

759
00:29:41,621 --> 00:29:42,970
So then when I get back from a run,
you know,

760
00:29:42,971 --> 00:29:44,770
it might be two hours,
sometimes even three.

761
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,000
And,
uh,

762
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,280
you know,
at that point I had just slept for eight

763
00:29:48,281 --> 00:29:49,900
to 10 hours.
Then,

764
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:51,520
you know,
by the time we got done with my run,

765
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:52,354
you know,
I hadn't had probably had an e I had 

766
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:56,770
essentially done like a small 
intermittent fast for the most part.

767
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,353
Um,
so like,

768
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,490
even when I had the higher amounts of 
carbohydrates,

769
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:01,324
I'd find myself going back into the coat
ketosis at the end of something like 

770
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:05,350
that sometimes.
Um,

771
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,210
but really it was,
to me,

772
00:30:07,211 --> 00:30:08,044
it wasn't necessarily a question of 
whether I was in Ketosis or not because 

773
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,280
that really wasn't important to me.
Um,

774
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,370
like it's is important.
Exactly.

775
00:30:15,371 --> 00:30:16,204
Yeah.
And what I wanted out of this approach 

776
00:30:18,491 --> 00:30:20,200
was,
um,

777
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,093
I wanted to be able to rely on my body 
to body to burn high levels of fat when 

778
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:26,944
I needed it to.
But I also wanted to be metabolically 

779
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:31,360
flexible enough where if I needed to hit
the gas pedal,

780
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,560
I could do that as well.

781
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,873
Um,
and I think that's where people get a 

782
00:30:35,111 --> 00:30:36,530
little uh,
uh,

783
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,563
confused are up in arms or something 
because there's not a whole lot of 

784
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:43,000
studies that kind of look at that 
specifically.

785
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:44,770
Like,
can you do that or can you not do that?

786
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:45,963
Some people think it's kind of an all or
nothing thing where you either get 

787
00:30:47,621 --> 00:30:48,454
really fat adapted or you get really 
carved dependence and then everything 

788
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:52,640
else is kind of like,
you know,

789
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,700
this gray area that you can't really get
into.

790
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,893
But that's not my experience.
My experience has been that like I can 

791
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,680
get the cure,
here's my kind of litmus test.

792
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:03,514
If I can go out for like a four hour,
even five hour run with no fuel other 

793
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:10,660
than water and electrolytes,
then I'm fat adapted enough.

794
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:11,494
I don't need to get any more fat adapted
than that because I can eat during the 

795
00:31:13,391 --> 00:31:16,060
race and everyone else is going to be,
so like,

796
00:31:16,061 --> 00:31:16,894
I don't really need to get more fat 
adapted that from a performance 

797
00:31:18,731 --> 00:31:19,564
standpoint.

798
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,250
Um,
so when I get to that point,

799
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,270
then it's like,
how many,

800
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,143
how many carbohydrates can I bring back 
to kind of give me that extra nudge or 

801
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:28,600
that extra fuel substrate.
Um,

802
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:32,440
have you ever tried mixing exogenous 
ketones with carbohydrates?

803
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,610
Um,
not,

804
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,390
was talking about that and doing 
steroids.

805
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,040
It was incredible.
Yeah.

806
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,620
He's,
he's a maniac.

807
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,300
He's a maniac yet there's a,
who else was it?

808
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:46,210
Was it dominic d'agostino is playing 
around with that stuff quite a bit too,

809
00:31:46,211 --> 00:31:47,970
or he might've helped.
Uh,

810
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,120
he might've helped,
uh,

811
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,370
with the,
the creation of some of that stuff.

812
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:52,204
I know there was a,
I'd have to look back in my emails and 

813
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:56,260
stuff,
but I actually had a,

814
00:31:56,261 --> 00:31:57,094
there was a guy who was doing a real 
clinical version of the exaggerators 

815
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:01,390
ketones and,
um,

816
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:05,290
he had sent me one a while back to kind 
of do a little test for him.

817
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,090
And,
uh,

818
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:07,983
it was like just this little canister of
exaggerates ketone and you wanted me to 

819
00:32:11,861 --> 00:32:14,230
kind of check my ketones when I woke up 
in the morning,

820
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,783
take that test at 15 minutes later and 
then test again after my run a ketone 

821
00:32:19,331 --> 00:32:20,590
ester.
Yeah,

822
00:32:20,591 --> 00:32:22,450
I think so.
Super potent stuff.

823
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,770
Taste like Dick Matt Brown brought some 
of that in and it's like woo.

824
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,633
Yet,
did you test your ketones when you took 

825
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:28,811
it at her?
No,

826
00:32:28,811 --> 00:32:31,540
I did and I didn't have a monitor on me,
but it tasted terrible.

827
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:35,620
But I felt great after it was over.
And you have to take it with a glucose.

828
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,521
Yeah.
Yeah.

829
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,950
See I think that's,
maybe that's where I messed up.

830
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,010
But uh,
um,

831
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,400
besides that,
like my ketone levels shot up.

832
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,263
I woke up that morning,
I think I was at like 1.0 millimoles or 

833
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:49,100
something like that.
I took that exogenous ketone,

834
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,263
um,
and 15 minutes later and I test I was a 

835
00:32:51,871 --> 00:32:52,910
3.7 millimoles.

836
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,320
Wow.
So it was like,

837
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,340
okay,
stuff works.

838
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,360
Yeah,
it worked.

839
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,010
But I don't know.
Here's what I,

840
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,873
here's my question is with that stuff 
from a performance standpoint is like 

841
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,793
it's people are looking at that kind of,
I think more like an light where it's 

842
00:33:07,371 --> 00:33:09,950
like I take this on top of my energy 
source,

843
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,500
whereas that's actually an energy 
source,

844
00:33:12,501 --> 00:33:13,334
a fairly potent one to.
So like when I'm out there racing and 

845
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:17,234
I'm trying to kind of limit,
I'm not trying to eat a certain amount 

846
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:24,350
so that I kind of keep that energy where
I want it,

847
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,070
but I'm also trying not to go overboard 
because I don't want digestive stress.

848
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,990
Um,
that's interesting.

849
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:30,824
So like as you're running,
you have to maintain like a certain 

850
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:37,820
amount of food and your system,
but you don't want to have a large meal.

851
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,811
Yeah,
yeah.

852
00:33:38,811 --> 00:33:43,760
Cause like basically the way it seemed 
to simply put it like digestion requires

853
00:33:43,761 --> 00:33:45,140
blood volume,
you know,

854
00:33:45,141 --> 00:33:47,720
to move into your gut and like digest 
the food.

855
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,670
So when you're running,
especially when it's hot,

856
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:50,504
your body is also trying to use your,
your blood volume for muscle function 

857
00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:53,504
and cooling and things like that.
So by kind of introducing another use 

858
00:33:56,811 --> 00:33:57,644
for that blood volume,
your body's probably is running out of 

859
00:34:00,381 --> 00:34:03,710
resources to kind of make all those 
things run smoothly.

860
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,933
Um,
which is why a lot of times an ultra 

861
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:07,184
marathons people find out,
like they have the worst luck with like 

862
00:34:10,011 --> 00:34:13,910
throwing up and stomach issues when it 
gets really hot out because their body's

863
00:34:13,911 --> 00:34:17,300
got to go double down on the cooling 
side of things with the blood volume.

864
00:34:17,301 --> 00:34:18,260
And then it's like,
well,

865
00:34:18,261 --> 00:34:19,094
something's got to give.
So it just picks up everything you put 

866
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:21,980
in your stomach.
Oh Wow.

867
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,421
Yeah.
So,

868
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:24,620
you know,
is there a way to medicate that,

869
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,060
uh,
eat less?

870
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,920
That's it.
So when you,

871
00:34:27,921 --> 00:34:29,870
if you're running like,
what's the size portion?

872
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,703
Like what do you,
what would you say if you're doing a 

873
00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:32,570
hundred miler?
Yeah.

874
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,940
And you have to pause for fuel.
Um,

875
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:35,803
you know,
I'll,

876
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,153
I'll typically aim for around a hundred 
to 200 calories an hour when I'm doing 

877
00:34:40,471 --> 00:34:43,220
an doing a hundred miler.
And to kind of put that in perspective.

878
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:47,210
When I was a high carb,
I was aiming for three,

879
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:49,280
four,
and sometimes even 500 calories an hour.

880
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,760
So when I kind of went into the approach
where fat was my primary fuel source,

881
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:59,480
the the need for that carbohydrate 
essentially got cut in half if not more.

882
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:00,643
And for me that's a win.
As long as energy levels are the same 

883
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,313
because it means I have to eat less 
during the race as one last logistic 

884
00:35:05,841 --> 00:35:07,730
thing,
one less potential stomach issue.

885
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,150
Um,
so what,

886
00:35:09,151 --> 00:35:12,740
what's a typical meal?
A typical meal like when you're running?

887
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,610
Oh,
while I'm running,

888
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:13,910
I,
you know,

889
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:16,060
I usually stick to like,
uh,

890
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,540
um,
uh,

891
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20,330
like water based stuff.
So like I'll use a product called,

892
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,760
um,
x endurance fuel five,

893
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,240
and it's essentially like a really,
really high level sports drink,

894
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,230
um,
with like a varying,

895
00:35:28,231 --> 00:35:28,840
um,
it's got,

896
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,673
it's,
it's carbohydrate based and I can tell 

897
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:31,694
you why I use carbohydrates instead of 
fats during a race in a minute too if 

898
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:34,940
you want.
Um,

899
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:38,650
but it's like five different types of 
kind of that release at varying points.

900
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:39,484
So you get some that's kind of a little 
quick jolt and others that are more 

901
00:35:41,131 --> 00:35:43,290
sustained,
like kind of like a sweet potato type of

902
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,820
a release.
Um,

903
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:45,683
so I'll be just trickling that in.
So like if I'm doing like a hundred 

904
00:35:48,571 --> 00:35:53,130
miler and let's say I'm aiming for like 
30 to 40 ounces of water,

905
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,373
uh,
per hour to kind of stay on top of 

906
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:57,480
hydration,
I'll put,

907
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:58,830
um,
you know,

908
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,280
to like a hundred to 200 calories with 
that stuff in that water.

909
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,220
So then I'm kind of killing two birds 
with one stone and getting my fuel in as

910
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:07,320
well as hydrating at the same time.
So what,

911
00:36:07,321 --> 00:36:10,440
and why you taking carbohydrates while 
you're running instead of fats?

912
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,400
Yeah.
So that's,

913
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,740
that's the other thing like in,
and I see this as,

914
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,783
as somewhat of a,
I don't know if it's an issue 

915
00:36:15,961 --> 00:36:16,794
necessarily,
but it's an interesting thing for that 

916
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,673
at the very least is when you,
when I talked to folks who are like 

917
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,880
really into the high fat approach,
you know,

918
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:27,720
some of them are like zero carb or like 
really ketogenic all the time,

919
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:28,620
24,
seven.

920
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:29,783
Uh,
there'll be taking in like fat sources 

921
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:33,960
during a race.
And I've never understood that.

922
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,913
Um,
just because when you look at your 

923
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:38,034
body's energy systems during a race,
like you have your glycogen stores and 

924
00:36:42,061 --> 00:36:42,894
then you have body fat and I think a lot
of people kind of get misled and they 

925
00:36:46,261 --> 00:36:46,651
think,
oh,

926
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:49,470
I'm a really lean runner so I can't rely
on body fat.

927
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,900
When in reality,
even the leanest endurance athletes have

928
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:54,300
enough body fat to get through an 
endurance race.

929
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,170
Like even if your 4% 5% body fat at your
leanest you,

930
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,140
that's a much bigger fuel source then 
your glycogen reserves.

931
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,393
So when I'm doing a race,
I've got enough fat to take care of the 

932
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:09,480
fat metabolizing portion of that energy,
a requirement for the race.

933
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,210
What I might run out of is those 
glycogen stores,

934
00:37:12,211 --> 00:37:13,044
which are really small in comparison.
So I'm trying to just slowly trickle in 

935
00:37:17,021 --> 00:37:17,540
the,
the,

936
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,430
the sugar or the carbohydrate during a 
race.

937
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,323
I'm just enough to kind of keep my 
glycogen stores where I want to be so I 

938
00:37:23,851 --> 00:37:26,100
can hit the gas if I need to.
Um,

939
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,113
but not at the level where it's going to
cost stomach distress or compromise or 

940
00:37:30,811 --> 00:37:33,510
heavily compromised.
My body's like willingness or ability to

941
00:37:33,511 --> 00:37:34,344
burn fat either.

942
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,600
That's fascinating.
So like as you're running,

943
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,703
your body could switch back and forth 
between fats and carbohydrates because 

944
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:42,240
you're so fat adapted.
Yeah.

945
00:37:42,241 --> 00:37:42,811
And I,
you know,

946
00:37:42,811 --> 00:37:45,000
it's actually probably happening like 
simultaneously,

947
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:48,960
it's just that different rates like,
like someone who's really fat adapted,

948
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:53,220
they could be running kind of the same 
effort and the fat after person might be

949
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,173
like burning 80% fat,
20% carbohydrate and the carb dependent 

950
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:58,440
person might be like a 50,
50 split.

951
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,573
So that carved dependent person is going
to exhaust our glycogen stores a lot 

952
00:38:01,651 --> 00:38:05,700
quicker or they're going to have to fuel
themselves at a much higher rate to make

953
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:08,160
up for that deficit.
And um,

954
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,190
when you look at like how difficult that
is,

955
00:38:11,191 --> 00:38:12,120
cause you know,
some of these,

956
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,460
especially some of these mountain races 
where you're running uphill,

957
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,353
it's like you,
you might be burning 800 plus calories 

958
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:19,350
an hour and it's really hard.

959
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,370
I'm all right.
Yeah.

960
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:20,911
Uh Huh.
Yeah.

961
00:38:20,911 --> 00:38:24,420
And it's really hard to replace that on 
the fly if you have those running uphill

962
00:38:24,421 --> 00:38:25,254
one.
So I would think that's a much more 

963
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:28,760
difficult race.
Yeah,

964
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,540
I mean it's a different setup.
It's,

965
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:31,403
you know,
it's one of those things where I'm 

966
00:38:33,361 --> 00:38:34,830
pretty new to that actually.
Like,

967
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,690
um,
most of my ultra running career folks,

968
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:39,820
moral flat stuff.
And part of that just because I've lived

969
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:42,340
in a lot of flat areas and like I was 
kind of saying earlier,

970
00:38:42,341 --> 00:38:44,590
if you really want to nail race you have
to be specific.

971
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,270
So I learned kind of early,
probably around like 2013 or so.

972
00:38:49,271 --> 00:38:52,810
That was in my best interest to make my 
peak racist flat ones if I really wanted

973
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:54,520
to meet my full potential.
Um,

974
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,503
now I live in Phoenix,
so I've got a lot more access to 

975
00:38:56,591 --> 00:38:57,010
mountains.

976
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:57,843
You,
I can get on the trails and the and do 

977
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:00,250
some significant climbing right out my 
back door.

978
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:01,540
So,
um,

979
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,403
I've certainly been able to practice 
that more and as I've gotten more 

980
00:39:05,861 --> 00:39:08,200
competent at it,
I do recognize like,

981
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,063
oh,
it's not quite as hard as I thought it 

982
00:39:11,711 --> 00:39:13,480
was originally because I was going into 
it essentially.

983
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:16,210
Undertrained whereas now it's like I go 
into it,

984
00:39:16,211 --> 00:39:16,541
I'm like,
Oh,

985
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:18,580
I'm,
I'm more adjusted to this.

986
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,470
So I mean,
it's still hard.

987
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:22,300
Like going uphill is hard no matter how 
you skin it,

988
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:23,134
but it's like,
it's one of those things where if you 

989
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:28,180
kind of figure out the pace,
it shouldn't be any more hard.

990
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,660
Like it should be just as hard to run 
flat because you're going to have to run

991
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,310
faster.
Um,

992
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,140
and it's just,
then it just comes down to I think,

993
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,540
the right training and,
you know,

994
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,240
pacing everything.

995
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,350
Right.
So interesting.

996
00:39:38,351 --> 00:39:42,280
You're saying you're living in Phoenix,
do you run the summer in Phoenix because

997
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:46,270
Phoenix is fucking insanely hot.
So I moved there in January.

998
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:50,710
So good wake up call comes,
you're like,

999
00:39:50,711 --> 00:39:51,550
whoa.
Yeah,

1000
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:52,780
it'll be,
it'll be warm.

1001
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:53,663
Um,
I actually kinda like it because right 

1002
00:39:54,491 --> 00:39:59,020
now I'm training for the western states 
100 and that's in,

1003
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,790
it starts in squaw valley and ends in 
Auburn,

1004
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:02,020
California.
Uh,

1005
00:40:02,021 --> 00:40:04,300
and they go through like these four 
canyons that get,

1006
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:06,880
can get brutally hot,
like 110 plus some years.

1007
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,910
Um,
and like it's like a vest.

1008
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:11,980
We have water bottles attached to or 
anything.

1009
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,060
Yup.
Yeah.

1010
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,060
That stuff has come such a long way 
since I started the sport.

1011
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:19,660
I remember when I first started it was 
pretty primitive type stuff.

1012
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:21,370
And now the,
the sport is,

1013
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:25,630
I think through hiking plays a big role 
in this too has gotten so popular,

1014
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:26,464
are popular enough where now companies 
are really tight dialing that stuff in 

1015
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,960
where you can get like a pack,
um,

1016
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,220
that just sits nice and snug on you.

1017
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,053
And you can put what like I use,
I use a brand called Nathan and they 

1018
00:40:36,671 --> 00:40:37,504
have like ones have bladders on the back
where they also have ones that you can 

1019
00:40:39,461 --> 00:40:41,680
put water bottles on the front.
Um,

1020
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:42,581
and then just,
you know,

1021
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:44,140
different setups and stuff.
So,

1022
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,680
so yeah,
that's like a must in,

1023
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:47,540
I mean,
he,

1024
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,230
even in early mornings,
it's got to be brutal in Phoenix.

1025
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:51,100
Right?
Yeah.

1026
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,033
Uh,
I mean I have yet to see the worst of 

1027
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:54,220
it.
Why did you move there?

1028
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:55,480
Uh,
well,

1029
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,550
part of it was,
um,

1030
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,560
I want to carry a gun.
Well,

1031
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:03,190
I'm looking at,
well,

1032
00:41:03,191 --> 00:41:05,290
I moved from Sacramento,
so let's say I'm looking into that now.

1033
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,260
But yeah,
so it's,

1034
00:41:08,261 --> 00:41:09,910
um,
it was,

1035
00:41:09,911 --> 00:41:12,400
it was a combination of things for me.
Like,

1036
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:13,323
uh,
I'm trying to kind of balance a few 

1037
00:41:14,081 --> 00:41:15,220
different things.
I,

1038
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,173
I train a lot.
I also work for one of my primary 

1039
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:19,990
sponsors,
ultra footwear,

1040
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:23,500
uh,
and like for me to be able to kind of do

1041
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:25,840
this stuff for them that I was wanting 
to do,

1042
00:41:25,841 --> 00:41:26,674
it made more sense to be in Phoenix,
just be product testing and stuff like 

1043
00:41:28,991 --> 00:41:29,501
that.
Yeah.

1044
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:31,330
That,
and just like putting on like,

1045
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,010
like small group runs and events and 
things like that in the area.

1046
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,933
Uh,
like if I wanted to invest or if I 

1047
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:39,500
wanted to kind of appropriately handled 
the territory,

1048
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:41,210
phoenix made a lot more sense in 
sacramento.

1049
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:44,480
Northern California has just grown so 
much for that company in the last couple

1050
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,313
of years that they needed to get someone
in there who's going to do full time 

1051
00:41:47,781 --> 00:41:49,280
plus to really cover the area.

1052
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,320
Um,
and then I,

1053
00:41:51,321 --> 00:41:52,760
you know,
I also got engaged in,

1054
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,650
in January as well.
So,

1055
00:41:54,651 --> 00:41:55,950
uh,
um,

1056
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,200
my fiance,
she,

1057
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:01,430
she was best served being in the Phoenix
area too,

1058
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:03,020
so it was kind of a mutual,
uh,

1059
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,410
she was from Dallas originally and 
Phoenix was kind of like a,

1060
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,170
a mutually good spot for both of us.
So,

1061
00:42:09,171 --> 00:42:10,200
uh,
um,

1062
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,920
we,
we both kind of looked at it as like,

1063
00:42:12,921 --> 00:42:14,360
well,
what do we want?

1064
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:17,030
And it was,
we want trails right in our backyard,

1065
00:42:17,031 --> 00:42:19,610
but we also want access to flat stuff.
And we,

1066
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,460
we actually kind of want the heat 
because it like,

1067
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:24,650
there's races where you need that to 
train for.

1068
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,020
So when it gets hot earlier,
you can prepare for them.

1069
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:32,120
A much easy reason to move to Phoenix.
I'm enjoying the heat for training.

1070
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,153
Well,
I'm not even the craziest one in the 

1071
00:42:34,641 --> 00:42:34,820
house.

1072
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,560
My,
my fiance's a savage.

1073
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,450
She,
yeah,

1074
00:42:38,451 --> 00:42:41,630
her name is Nicole Calla dropless.
She like,

1075
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,860
you know how like,
I thought,

1076
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:43,694
I've always thought I'm a hard worker 
and someone who like puts a lot of time 

1077
00:42:45,561 --> 00:42:47,990
and effort and the things I do.
And then I met her and,

1078
00:42:47,991 --> 00:42:48,711
uh,
you know,

1079
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:49,790
I like took,
she's,

1080
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:51,680
she's cut from the Jackal cloth,
let's put it that way.

1081
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,360
Right.
So,

1082
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,500
yeah,
she'll do like,

1083
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,353
she,
she works for a company called Towers 

1084
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:57,920
Watson.
Um,

1085
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,050
and uh,
Kinda does a,

1086
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:03,340
manages the Midwest division for like 
stuffs.

1087
00:43:03,341 --> 00:43:05,510
So she'll be on like a conference call 
with Amazon and then,

1088
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:06,763
you know,
go out and run three hours after that 

1089
00:43:07,471 --> 00:43:10,460
and then come back and get on another 
conference call and just keeps going and

1090
00:43:10,461 --> 00:43:12,200
going and going.
So,

1091
00:43:12,201 --> 00:43:12,680
yeah,
it's,

1092
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,840
uh,
it,

1093
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,833
it was,
it made sense for her job and my job to 

1094
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:17,414
kind of be in Phoenix and with as busy 
as she is and as busy as I can get from 

1095
00:43:21,051 --> 00:43:23,660
time to time,
like it's nice to be able to go out your

1096
00:43:23,661 --> 00:43:25,820
backyard and be on the trail five 
minutes later.

1097
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,710
Whereas both of us didn't have that 
before.

1098
00:43:27,711 --> 00:43:29,420
We both had to drive to get to any kind 
of trail,

1099
00:43:29,421 --> 00:43:31,270
especially her dallas.
It was a lot of,

1100
00:43:31,271 --> 00:43:33,560
it's just like flat road running in her 
area.

1101
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:36,980
So um,
to helps us him hardly any hills.

1102
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:37,821
No,
no,

1103
00:43:37,821 --> 00:43:38,660
you will.
And that's,

1104
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:41,720
that's,
that's what is impressive with like,

1105
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:43,610
so she's done western states a few 
times.

1106
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,190
The race,
I was telling him before the canyons and

1107
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:47,630
I,
she's been sixth place there twice,

1108
00:43:47,631 --> 00:43:49,220
just training on flat roads,
basically.

1109
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:52,430
Crazy.
Does she do anything to augment that?

1110
00:43:52,431 --> 00:43:55,160
Like doing lunges or anything like that?
Uh,

1111
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,080
she does,
uh,

1112
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,630
some strength work and stuff,
but really in a lot of it was just,

1113
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,493
you know,
she would go out and run and run a lot 

1114
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:03,163
and then I'm sure like she hasn't met 
her full potential at that specific 

1115
00:44:05,901 --> 00:44:09,560
event or certainly like mountain type 
races just because she wasn't trained in

1116
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,010
mountains.

1117
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:10,611
Right,
right.

1118
00:44:10,611 --> 00:44:11,444
Yeah.
And she's,

1119
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,160
she's good though.
So like,

1120
00:44:13,161 --> 00:44:13,994
I mean,
she was a division one recruit for 

1121
00:44:15,141 --> 00:44:17,230
college and stuff back in the day.
So like,

1122
00:44:17,231 --> 00:44:18,920
and she's got some rung talent,
no doubt.

1123
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:20,043
Um,
and then she puts in the work is 

1124
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:21,374
consistency is a huge thing.
Like if you can't find the specific 

1125
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:26,150
stuff and you're really geeked about a 
specific race,

1126
00:44:26,151 --> 00:44:26,984
like I don't think not having the right 
training environment as a reason to not 

1127
00:44:29,271 --> 00:44:31,560
do it if you're excited to do it.
Um,

1128
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:32,603
so like for her,
she was more excited to get out on the 

1129
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:36,060
trails and she wants to go,
you know,

1130
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,700
do something on a track or a flat road.
Like I was,

1131
00:44:38,701 --> 00:44:42,630
so for her it was like,
even if I'm not quite where I would like

1132
00:44:42,631 --> 00:44:43,890
to be,
I'm going to do it anyway.

1133
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,770
Now I'm not familiar with ultra 
footwear,

1134
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:47,604
but what I wanted to ask you is,
does anybody wear like minimalist shoes 

1135
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:53,520
and run these ultra marathons?

1136
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:54,930
Yeah,
yeah.

1137
00:44:54,931 --> 00:44:55,764
There was,
uh,

1138
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,560
there was actually a Gal,
I cannot remember her name,

1139
00:44:58,561 --> 00:45:01,680
this is a couple of years ago who ran 
ultras in um,

1140
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:04,200
those vibram fivefingers yeah,
yeah.

1141
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,790
And a trail stuff too.
So,

1142
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,290
um,
you know,

1143
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:08,490
it must have been a beast.
Yeah,

1144
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,381
yeah,
yeah.

1145
00:45:09,381 --> 00:45:11,010
Well,
hard to run just a couple miles.

1146
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:12,300
Yeah.
And it's,

1147
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,433
you know,
it's interesting because so ultra 

1148
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:18,050
footwear made the shoe this last year 
called uh,

1149
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:18,913
the,
the vanish and it's essentially a 

1150
00:45:20,101 --> 00:45:20,934
minimalist shoe.
I'm just like a little bit of fabric on 

1151
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:23,334
the top.
Super,

1152
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,233
super hard flat base.
And that's kind of what I like when I'm 

1153
00:45:26,611 --> 00:45:28,560
on a road or a track.
Um,

1154
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:30,510
so I was wearing that,
the vanish vanish.

1155
00:45:30,511 --> 00:45:31,344
Yeah.
Pull that up and see what that looks 

1156
00:45:32,161 --> 00:45:33,280
like.
And it's a,

1157
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,720
so I went to this,
this,

1158
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:35,703
this ultra race,
and I wore those thinking I'm going to 

1159
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,630
have the lightest shoe out of anyone 
here.

1160
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,640
Three guys show up running completely 
barefoot.

1161
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,090
Why?
He ran an ultra marathons barefoot.

1162
00:45:45,091 --> 00:45:45,870
Yeah,
he had to,

1163
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:47,820
that's another level.
There was one,

1164
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:48,683
there was one guy who is Christ.
He's like a to 22 or 23 marathoner and 

1165
00:45:52,831 --> 00:45:55,890
he's barefoot.
And he said that he like runs a marathon

1166
00:45:55,891 --> 00:45:57,930
bear,
so he doesn't do the marathon barefoot.

1167
00:45:57,931 --> 00:45:59,400
He actually said that,
uh,

1168
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:00,303
the,
that's a little bit of padding in that 

1169
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,720
it looks like we're less,
there's a lip on the outside.

1170
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,420
Is that the vantage or is that it's his 
vantage point.

1171
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:07,140
Yeah,
yeah,

1172
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,190
yeah,
yeah.

1173
00:46:08,191 --> 00:46:09,720
So I mean there's,
there's a little bit,

1174
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:12,330
there's like a,
it like a carbon fiber plate and you see

1175
00:46:12,331 --> 00:46:13,164
where that little cut is in there.
There's like a carbon fiber plate in 

1176
00:46:15,151 --> 00:46:15,984
there that makes it a little more firm.
So when I'm looking for in a shoe and 

1177
00:46:18,351 --> 00:46:19,184
I'm looking for kind of like that 
natural feel is something that's got to 

1178
00:46:21,841 --> 00:46:26,430
affirm its soul or affirm durometer 
because like I don't want to squish down

1179
00:46:26,431 --> 00:46:27,090
into the shoe.

1180
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,610
I want to pop right off the ground.
Um,

1181
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,130
and I think like really like that is 
just,

1182
00:46:32,131 --> 00:46:33,720
I mean you've probably experienced this 
with the,

1183
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:36,060
with the vibrams where like,
um,

1184
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:36,953
if you spend the time,
your foot feet gets stronger and 

1185
00:46:39,241 --> 00:46:42,820
stronger and stronger and it's only a 
matter of time before they get strong.

1186
00:46:42,821 --> 00:46:44,190
If you've got to keep kind of working at
it,

1187
00:46:44,191 --> 00:46:46,650
just like a weight lifter,
you know,

1188
00:46:46,651 --> 00:46:47,484
when they start out weightlifting,
they're nowhere near where they are 10 

1189
00:46:49,621 --> 00:46:51,150
years later.
Um,

1190
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:56,180
so like for me,
back in 2012 I think I kind of like,

1191
00:46:57,421 --> 00:46:58,254
you know,
I read born to run and I've even heard 

1192
00:46:59,041 --> 00:46:59,761
of the book.
Yeah,

1193
00:46:59,761 --> 00:47:00,960
I've heard some amazing,
yeah.

1194
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:01,570
You know,
I,

1195
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,450
I read that and I was like,
this is intriguing,

1196
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:05,400
you know,
and it made a lot of sense too.

1197
00:47:05,401 --> 00:47:06,690
It's like,
you know,

1198
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,510
if we were meant to have a wedge on our 
heel,

1199
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,120
like we would have had a wedge on our 
heel.

1200
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:13,300
Yeah.
No that's,

1201
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,840
that's a ridiculous thing that Nike came
up with.

1202
00:47:15,841 --> 00:47:16,674
And it's really unfortunate that so many
people have adopted that and they've 

1203
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:20,790
run,
he'll first like that.

1204
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:23,610
Yeah.
Well and the problem I think too is that

1205
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:27,060
like the shoe is essentially a cast for 
your foot.

1206
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,860
Even even that vanish that I had up 
there,

1207
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,600
a little cast compared to what you're 
normally going to see,

1208
00:47:31,601 --> 00:47:32,434
but it's still a cast.
That's why I liked those five fingers 

1209
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:37,300
cause there's nothing,
this is a very,

1210
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:38,134
very flexible,
Robbie's a rubber underneath and it's a 

1211
00:47:40,061 --> 00:47:41,650
glove for your,
for your feet.

1212
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,401
Yeah.
Yeah.

1213
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,290
And you know,
people just don't know that.

1214
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:45,124
I think that you can really work those 
foot muscles to a point where you can 

1215
00:47:47,651 --> 00:47:49,450
exhaust them the way you would in a 
shoe.

1216
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:50,493
Um,
it just takes a lot of time cause like 

1217
00:47:51,671 --> 00:47:55,720
if I broke my arm,
put a cast on it and then like six,

1218
00:47:55,721 --> 00:47:57,070
eight weeks later got the cast taken 
off,

1219
00:47:57,071 --> 00:47:59,530
I went back in the weight room and did a
normal routine,

1220
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:01,600
I would be wrecked the next day.

1221
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,570
So when you take your foot out of that 
shoe cast,

1222
00:48:04,571 --> 00:48:05,404
you have it in or take it out of the 
position it's gotten used to and put it 

1223
00:48:08,111 --> 00:48:08,944
in a different position,
it's like taking a cast off and trying 

1224
00:48:10,691 --> 00:48:14,020
to do that full mode of mode of a 
training or motion.

1225
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,273
So like you know,
I when I first kind of got an ultra 

1226
00:48:17,291 --> 00:48:17,890
running,
I,

1227
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:20,950
I I worked my way down to a minimal 
issue.

1228
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:22,203
I spent probably six months before I was
running exclusively and something that 

1229
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:28,120
was um,
really minimalist.

1230
00:48:28,121 --> 00:48:28,954
And when I say minimalist,
I mean zero drop and no cushion or 

1231
00:48:32,321 --> 00:48:33,154
little to no cushion.
Cause I think some people confuse that 

1232
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:36,124
too.
Like that the shoe you saw up there 

1233
00:48:37,661 --> 00:48:38,494
cause was like,
oh it looks like it's got a little bit 

1234
00:48:38,831 --> 00:48:41,410
of padding there.
So that's like zero drop with cushioning

1235
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,510
or that she really doesn't have a lot of
cushioning,

1236
00:48:43,511 --> 00:48:44,350
but,
um,

1237
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:46,030
there are shoes that ultra makes.

1238
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:48,460
It does.
And what that does is it takes you from,

1239
00:48:48,461 --> 00:48:50,620
like the way I describe is this is 
someone in like a,

1240
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,170
um,
someone in a traditional running shoe,

1241
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,440
real built up cushion.
A lot of support is on one in a spectrum

1242
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,333
barefoot runner.
Like those dudes that I ran into at the 

1243
00:48:58,691 --> 00:49:00,010
track,
um,

1244
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,810
they're on the other end of the 
spectrum.

1245
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:04,210
There's all the steps in between to get 
to that.

1246
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,793
So like,
I can't believe people run ultras 

1247
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,650
barefoot.
Yeah.

1248
00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:09,484
It's crazy.
I don't think there's too many periods 

1249
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:13,420
this fucking savage.
I look at this dude barefoot.

1250
00:49:13,421 --> 00:49:15,010
Ted.
Ted.

1251
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:17,830
Ted.
The Sandal.

1252
00:49:17,831 --> 00:49:18,664
Yeah.

1253
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,210
Is it a sandal?
Yeah.

1254
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,153
Hmm.
Well that it wasn't that in the born to 

1255
00:49:22,641 --> 00:49:25,070
one that these guys had made sandals out
of tires.

1256
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:25,933
Yeah.
Uh Huh.

1257
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,003
Yeah.
I've been using something called a pull 

1258
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:30,740
up,
this Vivo Vivo Barefoot.

1259
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,530
I've been using these.
Um,

1260
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:36,410
what I like about these is that I don't 
have to look where I step.

1261
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:38,920
There's no cushioning at all.
The trail one,

1262
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,400
I'll use that one.
The far left,

1263
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,690
the far left.
Yeah,

1264
00:49:41,691 --> 00:49:42,950
that run.
Um,

1265
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:44,203
there's no cushion to it,
but it's got some tread and the bottom 

1266
00:49:47,691 --> 00:49:48,524
is hard enough so that I could run on 
hard rocks and then I don't think about 

1267
00:49:52,251 --> 00:49:53,084
it.
It's hard to tell in that image how 

1268
00:49:54,921 --> 00:49:57,760
little there is underneath it.
But there's a,

1269
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:02,090
there's nothing going on in terms of 
like there's no squished to it at all to

1270
00:50:02,091 --> 00:50:04,450
just some good size knobs.
So you have,

1271
00:50:04,451 --> 00:50:05,780
uh,
some good,

1272
00:50:05,781 --> 00:50:08,120
um,
some good tread,

1273
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,200
you know,
so you can,

1274
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:10,123
you know,
you can get good traction and dirt and 

1275
00:50:12,261 --> 00:50:15,140
mud and stuff like that.
They weighed nothing

1276
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,021
that's,
yeah.

1277
00:50:16,021 --> 00:50:16,854
And you know,
it's normal that thing up to your foot 

1278
00:50:17,411 --> 00:50:18,850
muscles are flexing every which way 
they,

1279
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,050
yeah.
That's cool.

1280
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,050
It's made a big difference with me,
man.

1281
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:26,950
But honestly to five fingers are 
probably the best for that.

1282
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:30,410
They just don't have as much traction 
and I have to look where I'm stepping,

1283
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:31,723
you know,
like I have to be careful like sharp 

1284
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:34,820
rocks and stuff.
I have to look down.

1285
00:50:34,821 --> 00:50:35,870
Don't step on that one.
I'll look around.

1286
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,870
I don't like looking it just run with 
those.

1287
00:50:38,871 --> 00:50:40,430
I can just run.
Just flow through it.

1288
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,350
Yeah,
you can get a faster pace with those

1289
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:43,151
[inaudible].
Yeah,

1290
00:50:43,151 --> 00:50:43,840
and that's,
that's,

1291
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,630
that's where I kind of draw the line too
is like when I'm on the roads and on the

1292
00:50:46,631 --> 00:50:48,970
track,
I don't mind having that like no cushion

1293
00:50:48,971 --> 00:50:49,804
type of thing.
But then when I go on like the trails 

1294
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:52,114
and Phoenix,
it's very rocky and hard and then I'll 

1295
00:50:54,101 --> 00:50:57,760
use like a shoe called the king empty.
That's kind of like the one that you had

1296
00:50:57,761 --> 00:50:59,230
there.
It's a little less nimble I would say.

1297
00:50:59,231 --> 00:51:00,340
Then that one,
but it's got that,

1298
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:03,730
that like really aggressive lug.
It's got the foot shape,

1299
00:51:03,731 --> 00:51:05,380
toe box,
so I don't feel like my feet are getting

1300
00:51:05,381 --> 00:51:06,214
pinch together.
What do you think barefoot Ted does on 

1301
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,060
like on the trails?
I was trails.

1302
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:13,080
I think he probably wears those sandals 
probably,

1303
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:13,650
right?
Yeah.

1304
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:17,090
Just something where it's just something
that keeps him forgetting.

1305
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:18,013
Cut.
Yeah.

1306
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,590
But there are guys who just do that 
barefoot to fuck.

1307
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:23,720
I think they're very few,
but it's,

1308
00:51:23,721 --> 00:51:24,650
it's,
it's doable.

1309
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:26,920
Have you ever see that show dual 
survivor?

1310
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:30,430
It's one of those wacky survivor shows.
I don't know if I've seen that one.

1311
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:33,010
This one guy,
I think his name's corey,

1312
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,160
who has the most disgusting fee I've 
ever seen in my life.

1313
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,173
Almost as disgusting as that one guy was
cutting the bottom of feet off and 

1314
00:51:40,271 --> 00:51:42,340
feeding into dog.
That guy with the knife.

1315
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:44,650
Yeah.
That video's awful to watch.

1316
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:45,663
But a,
this guy walks barefoot everywhere and 

1317
00:51:47,831 --> 00:51:50,140
his idea is like,
do you gotta toughen your feet up?

1318
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:51,580
Because you might not have to have 
shoes.

1319
00:51:51,581 --> 00:51:52,240
You know,
they,

1320
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,860
they get real crazy with this whole 
survival,

1321
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:57,100
this then,
so this guy is basically has,

1322
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,053
I'm not joking,
like a good solid half inch of callous 

1323
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,870
under his entire foot.
Yeah.

1324
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:03,823
It's amazing what the human body will do
when you put it in a position to need 

1325
00:52:06,231 --> 00:52:07,064
to.
Yeah.

1326
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,810
Well it has to adapt.
I mean,

1327
00:52:08,811 --> 00:52:11,290
that's one of the reasons why I'm 
fascinated by guys like you,

1328
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:14,510
these ultra runners is because the,
for the average person,

1329
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,850
that's an impossible feat.
But you've built,

1330
00:52:16,851 --> 00:52:18,490
there's that guy's foot.
Look at that dude.

1331
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:21,590
What ends up fuck it looks like elephant
skin.

1332
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:23,450
Yeah,
it's fucking gnarly.

1333
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:24,623
Um,
but the guys like you have adapted your 

1334
00:52:27,261 --> 00:52:30,140
body to this position where,
you know,

1335
00:52:30,141 --> 00:52:30,974
you can do that and it's just a matter 
of putting in the training runs and 

1336
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:36,170
making sure you're fueling up correctly.
And,

1337
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,393
you know,
a hundred mile race is not a question 

1338
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:41,390
whether or not you could do it.
It's how fast he could do it.

1339
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,161
Yeah.
You know,

1340
00:52:42,161 --> 00:52:43,320
it's,
it's interesting,

1341
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,030
the cool thing in this,
Michael,

1342
00:52:45,031 --> 00:52:47,760
back to what you asked,
like why ultra marathons,

1343
00:52:47,761 --> 00:52:50,970
and I think it is part of it too is like
in a hundred miles,

1344
00:52:50,971 --> 00:52:54,600
it's almost like it's not a matter of 
when is something going to go wrong.

1345
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:55,300
It's,
um,

1346
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,420
or I should say,
if something's gonna go wrong,

1347
00:52:57,421 --> 00:52:59,880
it's a matter of when and how do you 
respond to it.

1348
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:02,910
So it's a typical thing that goes wrong.
Um,

1349
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:03,773
you know,
I think a lot of people will have like 

1350
00:53:05,851 --> 00:53:08,310
cramping or they'll,
they'll bonk,

1351
00:53:08,311 --> 00:53:09,144
I mean this is one of the reasons why I 
love the high fat approach is because 

1352
00:53:11,161 --> 00:53:11,994
like bonking from the light energy side 
of things is essentially nonexistent 

1353
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:16,950
explained bunkie too.
People don't know where you talk.

1354
00:53:16,951 --> 00:53:17,784
So,
so bonking is essentially what happens 

1355
00:53:18,901 --> 00:53:19,411
and it's,
it's,

1356
00:53:19,411 --> 00:53:22,680
I think it's actually more common in the
marathon just because people are running

1357
00:53:22,681 --> 00:53:23,850
a lot faster in those.

1358
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:24,983
But essentially what's is you're 
depleting your glycogen stores to the 

1359
00:53:27,091 --> 00:53:27,924
point where your body doesn't really 
have access to that fuel substrate 

1360
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:34,080
anymore.
And if you are trying,

1361
00:53:34,081 --> 00:53:37,980
if you're not good at metabolizing fat 
or you cannot burn fat at a high rate,

1362
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:39,383
at a decent clip,
a grinds to a halt and you see people 

1363
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:43,800
staggering and falling over,
losing her mind,

1364
00:53:43,801 --> 00:53:46,680
hallucinating and stuff like that in 
those situations.

1365
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,720
Um,
so like,

1366
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:50,820
you know,
banking is something that is,

1367
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,580
is an issue with ultra marathon because 
you're out there for so long.

1368
00:53:53,581 --> 00:53:55,330
If you get behind on fueling,
you know,

1369
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:57,210
you could bonk and stuff like that.
So,

1370
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:58,680
you know,
part of the reason,

1371
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,830
and I talked about before with like,
there's a lot of logistics with an ultra

1372
00:54:01,831 --> 00:54:03,960
marathon and there's all these variables
are just,

1373
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:05,003
just,
just so prevalent when you're out there 

1374
00:54:06,271 --> 00:54:09,560
that long that if you can eliminate some
of those are reduced,

1375
00:54:09,561 --> 00:54:12,570
the potential then flaring up,
that's usually a wind cause then there's

1376
00:54:12,571 --> 00:54:13,404
less chance of something popping up that
you wouldn't expect or an uncertain 

1377
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:17,030
thing happening during the race.
And,

1378
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:19,110
but they still happen.
You know,

1379
00:54:19,111 --> 00:54:19,944
I've done the,
I would say the most efficient hundred 

1380
00:54:21,421 --> 00:54:22,910
miler I've done is,
uh,

1381
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:23,813
when I,
I ran 11 hours and 40 minutes and 55 

1382
00:54:25,771 --> 00:54:28,380
seconds at a race in 2015 called Holy 
Shit.

1383
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:31,920
You bet you ran a hundred miles in 11 
hours.

1384
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:32,790
Yeah,
that was,

1385
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:35,150
that was on a trip.
That was one on the track in a Spec of a

1386
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,310
fuck.
That's crazy.

1387
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:41,550
Ran a 11 hours.
You were at a hundred miles.

1388
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:43,890
Yeah.
So I think the thing that,

1389
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:45,780
how long does it take to drive a hundred
miles?

1390
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,173
Okay.
It takes it.

1391
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:48,840
I mean,
if you go a hundred miles an hour,

1392
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,930
it takes an hour to me longer to get to 
the airport.

1393
00:54:51,931 --> 00:54:55,130
If the traffic on the five how's that 
bitter?

1394
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:55,973
Broke the US 100 mile record.
You average seven fucking minutes per 

1395
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:07,470
mile for almost 12 hours.
Dude,

1396
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:11,370
that is insane.
That is fucking insane.

1397
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,353
Bert Kreischer,
he brags when he runs 70 minute files 

1398
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,190
for like three miles.
What did,

1399
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,250
what did burdened up running that?
The La Marathon in six and a half.

1400
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,080
Six and a half.
I think it was close to that.

1401
00:55:22,081 --> 00:55:23,070
Yeah,
it's going to shorter than that.

1402
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,630
I think it was five,
five or something.

1403
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,890
Yeah.
No,

1404
00:55:25,891 --> 00:55:26,160
no,
no.

1405
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:26,993
Ours.
Dad.

1406
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,810
Yeah,
he's fucking JV.

1407
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,660
Well,
I'll say,

1408
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,880
I'll say,
I'll say this here,

1409
00:55:33,881 --> 00:55:34,890
bird,
if you're listening,

1410
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:36,143
contact me.
I'll get you to four and a half in six 

1411
00:55:37,111 --> 00:55:42,111
months.
You're challenge is Zach fucking man.

1412
00:55:42,121 --> 00:55:43,990
If he tells you you can do it,
that is,

1413
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:49,100
that is an incredible number that you 
broke the u s 100 mile record by running

1414
00:55:49,111 --> 00:55:52,770
seven fucking minutes per mile.
It's,

1415
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:54,210
it's,
that's crazy.

1416
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,393
The thing.
And the interesting thing I thought 

1417
00:55:56,241 --> 00:55:57,074
about that event was when I was talking 
about efficiency is I stopped twice 

1418
00:56:00,411 --> 00:56:01,244
during that race and it was for maybe a 
total of like 60 at most 90 seconds 

1419
00:56:05,031 --> 00:56:06,620
total.
And it was just,

1420
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:07,483
it was just a p two times.
Do you have a thought about just pee in 

1421
00:56:09,621 --> 00:56:11,480
your pants and just keep running?
Well,

1422
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:15,290
black shorts party rolling.
There was a guy who did that.

1423
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,373
Uh,
it was two years before I did that race 

1424
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,460
and he was trying to break 13 hours and 
he was like right on the edge.

1425
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,130
I mean,
he just whipped it out and peed

1426
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,270
all over the track,
I'm pretty sure.

1427
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,640
Okay.
What would he put his penis on?

1428
00:56:27,641 --> 00:56:28,600
Pants.
I don't know.

1429
00:56:28,601 --> 00:56:28,931
Yeah,
I mean,

1430
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:31,000
I think that's probably what I would do.
And um,

1431
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,310
it's uh,
uh,

1432
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,970
that guy dude,
he did himself well.

1433
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:36,880
Everyone who's been doing endurance 
sport long enough,

1434
00:56:36,881 --> 00:56:37,714
we'll have,
have a situation like that 

1435
00:56:38,741 --> 00:56:41,170
unfortunately.
Got Him of his legs.

1436
00:56:41,171 --> 00:56:45,100
He must've just exploded last.
It must have been a bomb bomb went off.

1437
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:46,211
Oof.
Yeah.

1438
00:56:46,211 --> 00:56:47,350
It's,
you know,

1439
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:48,423
it's,
it's okay to poop your pants does a 

1440
00:56:49,571 --> 00:56:51,940
sign,
is that him with the same guy?

1441
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:57,010
Different person.
It's very a sensitive subject for folks.

1442
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,200
Yeah.
Your parents.

1443
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:58,910
Yeah.
It's,

1444
00:56:58,910 --> 00:56:59,743
it's a,
it's a running joke in the endurance 

1445
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:03,020
running community though.
Cause if you do it long enough to spend,

1446
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:04,920
probably happen to eventually passed it.
Right.

1447
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:08,710
And I would imagine you're running a 
hundred miles and your body's gonna.

1448
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:12,190
There's gonna be misfires for sure.
How do you time your meals?

1449
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,053
Like before you run it,
like say if you're going to run a 

1450
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:15,933
hundred miles,
what is your last meal before you get 

1451
00:57:16,721 --> 00:57:17,471
there?
Yeah,

1452
00:57:17,471 --> 00:57:19,750
so I'll eat a big dinner the night 
before,

1453
00:57:19,751 --> 00:57:21,700
probably around like four or five 
o'clock.

1454
00:57:21,701 --> 00:57:23,080
And what would that be?
Um,

1455
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,230
so I'll do like a huge steak.
Uh,

1456
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:27,093
I try to keep 16 ounces,
20 ounces at least 1620 is probably a 

1457
00:57:31,661 --> 00:57:36,310
pretty good number.
140 pounds give or take a lot of fucking

1458
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,170
meat.
That's crazy.

1459
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,273
Well,
this is where it gets fascinating with 

1460
00:57:40,271 --> 00:57:41,104
the lifestyle thing I was telling you 
about is like there's days during the 

1461
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,043
year where like I'm in training where 
I'm metabolizing two to three times my 

1462
00:57:46,721 --> 00:57:50,230
resting metabolic rate.
So I've got to feed myself appropriately

1463
00:57:50,231 --> 00:57:51,640
for that.
Um,

1464
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,890
and that means a lot of stake.
Wow.

1465
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:56,410
So was that your primary food source?
Um,

1466
00:57:56,411 --> 00:58:00,730
I don't know if I'd say stake for sure,
but definitely fatty meat sources.

1467
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,440
Um,
a lot of like,

1468
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:03,303
uh,
like saturated fat based oils like 

1469
00:58:05,471 --> 00:58:07,900
coconut oil,
like Geeky,

1470
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,850
that sort of thing.
Um,

1471
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,960
but yeah,
I don't,

1472
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,033
I don't shy away from meat.
I usually have meat or eggs for every 

1473
00:58:14,711 --> 00:58:15,544
meal for the most part.
And interesting in every meal I should 

1474
00:58:18,101 --> 00:58:18,611
say.
Yeah.

1475
00:58:18,611 --> 00:58:21,670
There's a lot of talk lately about the 
Carnivore Diet.

1476
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,530
There's a lot of people that are delving
into that,

1477
00:58:23,531 --> 00:58:24,364
including Jordan Peterson's daughter,
which is a really interesting case 

1478
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:31,510
because she had severe autoimmune 
disorder.

1479
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:36,040
Like she had some severe issues with 
like horrible arthritis where she's had,

1480
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:37,443
um,
I know she's had hip replacements and 

1481
00:58:39,431 --> 00:58:42,310
that believe she's having an ankle 
replaced soon too.

1482
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:42,910
Okay.
Like,

1483
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:47,910
she's like severe issues and if she eats
anything other than me,

1484
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:49,690
it flares up horribly.

1485
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,090
It's really crazy.
I've never,

1486
00:58:52,091 --> 00:58:53,440
I'm not going to,
I want to try to talk to her,

1487
00:58:53,441 --> 00:58:54,970
maybe even get her in here.
But,

1488
00:58:54,971 --> 00:58:55,550
um,
I,

1489
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:58,450
I've never heard anything like that.
I thought I heard somewhere.

1490
00:58:58,620 --> 00:58:59,453
Um,
it was after the last time you had 

1491
00:59:00,311 --> 00:59:01,144
Jordan on where he was telling you about
how he just basically he meets in 

1492
00:59:03,281 --> 00:59:04,114
Greens.
Where was on his daughter's 

1493
00:59:04,811 --> 00:59:05,950
recommendation?
Yeah,

1494
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:09,010
I think he's cut out all vegetables 
right now for at least a trial.

1495
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,440
I thought I saw something about that.
Um,

1496
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:12,101
but yeah,
it's,

1497
00:59:12,101 --> 00:59:14,470
it's one of those things where I think 
like some,

1498
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:18,220
it's like what I was saying before,
like why I don't necessarily want people

1499
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,054
to say like,
well Zach is saying everyone should do 

1500
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:22,010
exactly what he's doing

1501
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:22,850
and then,
you know,

1502
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:24,440
they,
that's important to bring up.

1503
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,753
Everybody's body is different for sure.
I mean to the point where like you have 

1504
00:59:28,761 --> 00:59:29,594
people like that,
like when I had issues I were having 

1505
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:35,530
were incredibly minor compared to the 
Jordan Peterson's daughter.

1506
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:36,410
Like,
like,

1507
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:39,080
I mean,
she's in a spot where,

1508
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,540
you know,
she had to make changes if she wanted to

1509
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:44,630
even just probably do daily activities.
Um,

1510
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,300
and you know,
that's that,

1511
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:49,400
that's I think the hard part for people 
to kind of understand is like,

1512
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:51,680
there people are at different stages of 
that.

1513
00:59:51,681 --> 00:59:52,514
Some people,
like no one's breaking themselves 

1514
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:54,413
overnight.
So it's like this is something that's 

1515
00:59:55,881 --> 00:59:56,714
chipping away at people and sometimes it
chips away at them quicker and some 

1516
00:59:59,661 --> 01:00:02,220
people and it takes longer for others.
Uh,

1517
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:03,103
so if you have an issue like that,
it's like you almost have to go back to 

1518
01:00:05,841 --> 01:00:07,520
square one and say,
what are,

1519
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:11,330
give me a couple things that I know 
aren't going to upset me.

1520
01:00:11,331 --> 01:00:14,690
And let's start from there and see if we
can start adding things back eventually.

1521
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:15,890
Maybe.
Or,

1522
01:00:15,891 --> 01:00:16,850
um,
you know,

1523
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:17,940
we,
uh,

1524
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:19,640
you know Sean Baker you had on the 
podcast,

1525
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:23,300
we actually started recording some 
podcasts together and um,

1526
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:24,343
we are having this gal come on who's 
been a carnival for eight years and she 

1527
01:00:27,561 --> 01:00:28,394
was kind of in that situation where she 
had a whole bunch of goofy things going 

1528
01:00:31,011 --> 01:00:31,844
on even with the Quito Protocol and she 
eventually just cut everything up with 

1529
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:36,620
meat and has been doing great ever 
since.

1530
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:39,200
That's a vegans nightmare and things 
like that.

1531
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,360
Like,
well,

1532
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:41,263
yeah,
I just wish people could separate their 

1533
01:00:43,051 --> 01:00:46,440
ideology from the reality of certain 
people's bodies.

1534
01:00:46,441 --> 01:00:48,600
And,
and unfortunately,

1535
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:50,040
and this is very,
unfortunately,

1536
01:00:50,041 --> 01:00:52,410
you've got a separate,
also all your,

1537
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,680
all the horrors that we associate with 
factory farming and all the other things

1538
01:00:55,681 --> 01:00:57,780
that we associate with meat and meat 
consumption,

1539
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,093
those things are real and terrible and 
he absolutely should be avoided in 

1540
01:01:02,551 --> 01:01:04,440
absolutely factory farmers should be 
illegal.

1541
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:07,200
I mean,
I think it's one of the great horrors of

1542
01:01:07,201 --> 01:01:08,700
modern society.
I really,

1543
01:01:08,701 --> 01:01:11,190
really do.
But take that away.

1544
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:12,503
And you know,
some people don't think animals should 

1545
01:01:13,291 --> 01:01:15,450
die at all,
but they don't live forever.

1546
01:01:15,451 --> 01:01:18,150
And other animals eat them and it's just
like this is just a part of life.

1547
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:19,733
Then you're into health and whether or 
not consuming meat is actually healthy 

1548
01:01:25,051 --> 01:01:27,210
and there's no evidence that it's not,
there's none.

1549
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:28,623
Yeah.
You know the thing that like I want a 

1550
01:01:31,661 --> 01:01:32,494
Vegan to sit me down and explained to me
is that like when I look at 

1551
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:38,970
bioavailability,
um,

1552
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:39,903
of micro nutrients,
it's like you can't find much better 

1553
01:01:42,701 --> 01:01:43,534
than liver.
Like it's like the stuff is super 

1554
01:01:46,061 --> 01:01:46,894
available.

1555
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:49,920
Quite Alpha wolves immediately go to the
river when they kill something.

1556
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:52,810
Yeah.
So like it and it,

1557
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,250
so like it's like I need that.
Like,

1558
01:01:55,251 --> 01:01:56,084
I don't know.
I'm sure there's ranges of what people 

1559
01:01:57,141 --> 01:01:58,790
can do in terms of absorbing something 
like,

1560
01:01:58,791 --> 01:02:03,680
like a non heme iron versus a heme iron.
But like for me it's,

1561
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,730
it's like if my iron levels below low,
the first thing I'm going to,

1562
01:02:07,731 --> 01:02:11,000
I'm doubling down on liver,
doubling down on liver and it's like far

1563
01:02:11,001 --> 01:02:11,834
as nutrients.

1564
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:15,430
Just talking about,
just from a purely objective standpoint,

1565
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:16,533
the consumption of nutrients,
organ meats are some of the best for 

1566
01:02:18,611 --> 01:02:20,160
sure.
You're aware of Chris Kresser?

1567
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:21,463
Yep.
Chris was a macrobiotic Vegan and you 

1568
01:02:23,521 --> 01:02:24,354
know,
I mean he was like fully hardcore and 

1569
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,830
this was having all sorts of huge 
issues.

1570
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:33,240
His body just didn't react to it and he 
fixed all that by eating organ meat.

1571
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:35,340
And that's like his primary food source.

1572
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:36,610
Yeah.
Um,

1573
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:37,743
what's the Gal's name?
There's a lady who she can't remember 

1574
01:02:40,611 --> 01:02:42,440
what she had.
Uh,

1575
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:44,590
I'm,
I'm not going to think of it,

1576
01:02:44,591 --> 01:02:45,520
but if I do,
I'll remember.

1577
01:02:45,521 --> 01:02:46,960
But she did pretty much the same thing.

1578
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:49,410
But some people are fine with the Vegan 
diet too.

1579
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:51,150
That's the other thing that's important 
to point out.

1580
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:55,440
It might not be the best for them in 
terms of like bioavailability,

1581
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:56,483
bioavailability of nutrients,
but it's certainly better than standard 

1582
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,904
western diet.

1583
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,060
Sure.
American diet,

1584
01:03:01,061 --> 01:03:04,150
but for some people they can get by with
it and not have any issues.

1585
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,800
Well,
some people get away with even more.

1586
01:03:05,801 --> 01:03:08,440
I mean Courtney to Walter Candy,
right?

1587
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,290
Like it's candy and drinks beer,
Eatsa Nachos.

1588
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,513
We took it to a Bagel place.
She fucking chow down hills and cream 

1589
01:03:15,221 --> 01:03:16,960
cheese.
She's a fucking animal man.

1590
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:17,823
I read an article about her not too long
ago and she said that she's got like 

1591
01:03:19,961 --> 01:03:22,240
candy jar sitting around the house and 
she's like,

1592
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,970
before I go for a run,
I'll go anywhere from just like,

1593
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:27,370
you know,
nibbling on it to a small stomach ache.

1594
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:32,350
So we're not operating from the same 
field I guess.

1595
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:34,890
And that she's a real freak man,
you know,

1596
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:36,653
there's people that know her that just,
they're stunned by her because what's 

1597
01:03:39,871 --> 01:03:42,930
interesting about her is she's not a 
fast runner in per say,

1598
01:03:42,931 --> 01:03:44,640
like,
like the way she would run a marathon.

1599
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:46,860
She'd run a marathon and like three 
hours.

1600
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:47,783
So did she,
did she talk about how she got into 

1601
01:03:50,281 --> 01:03:52,770
running when she was out here?
I believe she did.

1602
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:54,600
Do you remember her specifically,
Jamie?

1603
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:55,813
Sort of like you,
she ran in high school I think a little 

1604
01:03:57,151 --> 01:03:59,520
bit,
but was she was teaching as well.

1605
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:00,061
Okay.
Yeah.

1606
01:04:00,061 --> 01:04:00,894
While she was teaching,
she was running and doing these things 

1607
01:04:02,761 --> 01:04:03,594
and then eventually she was able to get 
enough sponsors so that she could run 

1608
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:08,820
full time,
which is what she does now.

1609
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,040
But with with her,
I think,

1610
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:14,820
and this is one of the reasons why I'm 
fascinated by you folks with her,

1611
01:04:14,821 --> 01:04:15,780
it's her mind.

1612
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:20,400
Her mind is just unbelievably powerful.
When she was experiencing cornea,

1613
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:23,430
a deimos might hurt.
She couldn't fucking see man.

1614
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:27,300
She was literally blind that she barely 
could see her feet and she still won.

1615
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:29,760
She fell,
cracked her head open,

1616
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:33,080
blood's pouring down her head and she's 
still one.

1617
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:34,500
Was it,
was that at run rabbit run?

1618
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:36,110
I don't think that was what it was.
Yeah,

1619
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:38,370
I think that's what it was.
And there's an image of her crossing the

1620
01:04:38,371 --> 01:04:40,380
finish line.
Literally can't see shit.

1621
01:04:40,381 --> 01:04:41,214
She's got her hands in front of her.
She's covered in blood like she's up 

1622
01:04:44,021 --> 01:04:46,240
fucking savage.
She's,

1623
01:04:46,241 --> 01:04:46,510
she's,

1624
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:48,010
she's a,
if you take the,

1625
01:04:48,011 --> 01:04:50,050
then just think about ultra marathons is
like,

1626
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,030
we kind of,
we're small enough sport where it's like

1627
01:04:52,031 --> 01:04:53,020
you can't really say like,
Oh,

1628
01:04:53,021 --> 01:04:54,490
I'm a hundred miler.
It's like,

1629
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:55,241
okay,
you everybody,

1630
01:04:55,241 --> 01:04:56,074
wait.
No.

1631
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:57,700
Well it's like,
yeah,

1632
01:04:57,701 --> 01:04:58,534
I know.
So like you have everything from a 50 

1633
01:04:59,711 --> 01:05:00,544
kilometer that's got over 10,000 feet of
climbing and descending to a six day 

1634
01:05:03,071 --> 01:05:05,050
event on a track and they're all the 
same sport.

1635
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:09,940
When you look at like people who can 
kind of do really well at all of them or

1636
01:05:09,941 --> 01:05:12,160
in Courtney's case really well at all of
them,

1637
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:15,010
you can't find a better female on the 
female side of things.

1638
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:16,960
Someone who can do it better than that 
like she does.

1639
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,250
She goes,
it goes on the track,

1640
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:19,383
kills it.
She goes and 240 miles through the 

1641
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:21,874
mountains.
Kills it.

1642
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:23,043
It's crazy.

1643
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:25,240
Yeah.
She's something on really,

1644
01:05:25,241 --> 01:05:27,130
really unusual.
You know,

1645
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:28,890
a buddy of mine,
my friend Brian,

1646
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,790
it was texting me about her while she 
was getting,

1647
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:32,380
Brian is,
he doesn't even run,

1648
01:05:32,381 --> 01:05:34,060
I don't think are barely,
I mean it's not a,

1649
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:35,283
but he was just so fascinated by this 
one woman that was so far ahead of 

1650
01:05:37,781 --> 01:05:40,030
everybody was like,
what the fuck is she doing?

1651
01:05:40,031 --> 01:05:45,031
Then she beat the second place guy by 10
hours in a 238 mile race,

1652
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,700
22 miles.
She was ahead of him.

1653
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:49,280
Yeah.

1654
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,770
That's an interesting topic to where 
like the,

1655
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:56,660
where like men and women in an ultra 
marathon and how that kind of like where

1656
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,790
it's one of the rare races where women 
can win.

1657
01:05:59,120 --> 01:05:59,953
And it's the,
the interesting thing to me about it is 

1658
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:06,560
women can and do win some races,
but when they're like,

1659
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,990
like Courtney's very much the most,
I would say,

1660
01:06:08,991 --> 01:06:11,360
talented person to do one of the 200 
milers.

1661
01:06:11,361 --> 01:06:12,194
Yet,
like there hasn't been a lot of what 

1662
01:06:13,671 --> 01:06:16,610
like the,
the top of the sport hasn't really moved

1663
01:06:16,611 --> 01:06:17,331
into that.
I mean,

1664
01:06:17,331 --> 01:06:19,000
courtney certainly is top of the sport,
but she's,

1665
01:06:19,001 --> 01:06:22,400
I think she's the best.
I think she's the best woman all around.

1666
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:24,550
Right?
If certainly in the United States thinks

1667
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,570
she's the best at running those 200 
milers,

1668
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:27,853
uh,

1669
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:32,170
is it dependent upon altitude gain and 
loss and

1670
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:34,460
bleed and it,
and just variables to the day?

1671
01:06:34,461 --> 01:06:35,560
I think like,
so like,

1672
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:35,960
I mean,
there's,

1673
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,840
there's some real,
like there's a guy named Kilian journey,

1674
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:41,840
um,
and he spells his name,

1675
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:42,800
j.
O.

1676
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:43,011
R,
n,

1677
01:06:43,011 --> 01:06:47,660
e t and uh,
he won the,

1678
01:06:47,661 --> 01:06:48,800
um,
or he,

1679
01:06:48,801 --> 01:06:49,611
he's,
he's,

1680
01:06:49,611 --> 01:06:52,700
he's essentially the best mountain 
runner by far.

1681
01:06:52,701 --> 01:06:53,534
Like there's maybe one of the guy who 
could maybe compete with him at 

1682
01:06:55,491 --> 01:06:58,330
something under a hundred miles,
but if it's like he's,

1683
01:06:58,350 --> 01:06:59,183
he's,
he would probably like beat everyone by 

1684
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,750
who knows how much in a 200 we've seen 
one of these videos before.

1685
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:06,201
Yeah.
He'll,

1686
01:07:06,201 --> 01:07:07,034
he'll run on these,
he'll run on these like ridge lines and 

1687
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:09,833
like,
it'll be the death on both sides and he 

1688
01:07:11,181 --> 01:07:12,014
just

1689
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:16,610
play these fucking guys,
man.

1690
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:18,900
Oh,
I have cms.

1691
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:22,210
This isn't even nearly as Shane.
Oh,

1692
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:22,870
Mike.
Yeah,

1693
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:23,890
that's,
that's crazy.

1694
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:26,643
Look at him.
It looks like a freak to the gopro 

1695
01:07:28,001 --> 01:07:30,130
strapped to his heaven.
That's gotta throw your balance off.

1696
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:33,230
He's running with a Gopro.
Put that down intention.

1697
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:34,480
That was my son.
I'd be like,

1698
01:07:34,481 --> 01:07:36,490
pay attention where you're running kid 
Jesus.

1699
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:37,800
Yeah,
he's interesting because I mean,

1700
01:07:37,801 --> 01:07:39,720
his parents were like mountaineers I 
think,

1701
01:07:39,721 --> 01:07:40,554
and like,
so he was like basically playing in the 

1702
01:07:41,311 --> 01:07:44,220
mountains at like age three and 
basically grew up doing this stuff.

1703
01:07:44,221 --> 01:07:46,110
So yeah.
So he's the,

1704
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,910
he's the type of guy who like,
he's,

1705
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,860
he's probably the best in the sport 
right now.

1706
01:07:49,861 --> 01:07:50,650
And it's

1707
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,340
my guys jumping around.
He's an asshole.

1708
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:53,780
He's an asshole.
He's,

1709
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,770
he is running folks.
What is this a video?

1710
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:58,520
Instagram.
I don't really know.

1711
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:01,460
Okay.
[inaudible] spell his name.

1712
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:03,470
Kay.
I is that two l's,

1713
01:08:03,471 --> 01:08:04,790
one l one l.
I.

1714
01:08:04,791 --> 01:08:07,640
A n.
J.

1715
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:07,640
O.
R.

1716
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:07,640
N.
E.

1717
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:10,050
T.
And he's running in [inaudible].

1718
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:12,680
How do you say that?
Chamonix chaminade.

1719
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:16,310
Chamonix France.
And he's running one on what looks

1720
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:21,050
like the fin of a shark.
If a shark was the size of a mountain,

1721
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:24,350
this guy's a fucking animal,
man.

1722
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:26,990
That is so scary.
Oh,

1723
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:32,950
I get sweaty.
My hands are sweating just watching it.

1724
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,930
And so he is the best on the mountains 
for sure.

1725
01:08:35,931 --> 01:08:37,100
He doesn't do anything that's not 
mountain.

1726
01:08:37,101 --> 01:08:37,934
It's like he did western states and one 
in 2011 and he was complaining about it 

1727
01:08:42,501 --> 01:08:45,050
being too flat.
Oh Jesus Christ.

1728
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:48,710
What is the gain and loss of elevation 
in Western net downhill?

1729
01:08:48,711 --> 01:08:52,220
So it's 2100 25,000 feet down.
17,000 feet up.

1730
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:54,170
What?
So he's complaining about that.

1731
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:55,040
Yeah.
It's too flat.

1732
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:58,970
17,000 feet up and it gets much crazier.
And that you can do,

1733
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:02,200
you can do like 50 miles or 100 k's that
have the same profile as that.

1734
01:09:02,201 --> 01:09:03,050
So you can get,
like,

1735
01:09:03,051 --> 01:09:05,810
if you're doing like what he's doing,
that probably does feel kind of flat for

1736
01:09:05,811 --> 01:09:06,020
him.

1737
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:08,300
Like he likes that steep technical 
stuff.

1738
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:10,130
So,
but yeah,

1739
01:09:10,131 --> 01:09:11,480
so as far as the mountains go,
he's,

1740
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:12,373
he's the guy to beat for sure.
And he'll do races on a regular basis 

1741
01:09:15,711 --> 01:09:18,740
when he is running because he's actually
a professional skier too.

1742
01:09:18,741 --> 01:09:21,470
So like he's only running basically half
of the year and he's skiing.

1743
01:09:21,471 --> 01:09:23,280
The other half is Christ.
Yeah.

1744
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:23,930
Yeah.
So He's,

1745
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:26,210
he's a fun dude to follow for sure.
Um,

1746
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:27,703
but yeah,
it's a w when you look at like some of 

1747
01:09:29,361 --> 01:09:31,880
the races that are kind of the big 
races,

1748
01:09:31,881 --> 01:09:32,714
like Western states,
100 is the most competitive hundred 

1749
01:09:34,251 --> 01:09:36,770
miler in the United States and ultra 
trail Mont Blanc,

1750
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,930
which is actually by chaminade where you
saw that video,

1751
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,960
um,
is probably at least a last year was the

1752
01:09:41,961 --> 01:09:44,120
most competitive in the world.
Um,

1753
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:44,983
those are the reasons I like to look at 
to kind of see like where the 

1754
01:09:47,031 --> 01:09:49,220
divergences from the males and the 
females.

1755
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:50,443
Uh,
and if you look at like course records 

1756
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,340
and winning times,
like,

1757
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:53,203
you know,
the men are finishing like two plus 

1758
01:09:55,221 --> 01:09:59,090
hours ahead of the women are on a pretty
regular basis on that type of stuff.

1759
01:09:59,091 --> 01:10:02,030
And um,
at ultra trail mount blonde,

1760
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:03,890
you know,
sometimes it's four or five hours,

1761
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:05,500
uh,
and then it,

1762
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:08,690
so then you can kind of lay,
it actually kind of is more in line with

1763
01:10:08,691 --> 01:10:09,524
what you see with other endurance 
distances like marathons and stuff like 

1764
01:10:11,631 --> 01:10:12,770
that.
Uh,

1765
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:15,620
the crazy thing about it though is,
uh,

1766
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:17,960
that doesn't mean that's going to happen
every time.

1767
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:18,853
Like there's certainly years where women
do really well and finish like in the 

1768
01:10:21,141 --> 01:10:25,340
top 10 amongst the in like look western 
states or utm be,

1769
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:27,980
um,
one year in 2006,

1770
01:10:27,981 --> 01:10:29,630
uh,
this gal and Nikki Kimball,

1771
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:30,763
uh,
she finished third overall at Western 

1772
01:10:32,601 --> 01:10:33,434
states was,
which is the highest finish finishing 

1773
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:36,043
finishing place for a woman other than 
this other lady named Anne Treyson who 

1774
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:41,030
she hasn't really race anymore,
but she was,

1775
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:43,460
she's kind of like the legend of the 
sport from the women,

1776
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:44,743
uh,
where she's,

1777
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:46,330
she's uh,
um,

1778
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:47,323
one western states like 14 times and had
like 20 world records at one point and 

1779
01:10:51,081 --> 01:10:51,740
stuff like that.

1780
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:53,120
And um,
but Nikki,

1781
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:54,980
Nikki Kimball,
she finished third and part of it was,

1782
01:10:54,981 --> 01:10:57,200
cause that was like the hottest year in 
the canyons on record.

1783
01:10:57,590 --> 01:10:58,423
And if women do,
one thing I'm pretty confident women do 

1784
01:11:00,981 --> 01:11:04,250
better at these hundred miles in men is 
they're not nearly as stupid.

1785
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:07,610
Like the man will go out.
And like,

1786
01:11:07,611 --> 01:11:08,444
if it's competitive,
it takes one or two guys to kind of run 

1787
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:14,100
a little too fast and he's gonna bring 
five,

1788
01:11:14,101 --> 01:11:15,180
six,
seven guys with them.

1789
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:19,350
And then it's actually a fascinating 
racing concept,

1790
01:11:19,351 --> 01:11:20,184
I think,
because then it's like if you're 

1791
01:11:20,761 --> 01:11:21,690
watching it,
you're like,

1792
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:22,913
okay,
one of these guys didn't have the race 

1793
01:11:23,551 --> 01:11:26,790
of his life and hold on for dear life 
and run a spectacular time.

1794
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:29,730
Everyone else is going to blow up.
Apically when's it going to happen?

1795
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:33,480
So you can thin out that men's field 
really easily when that happens.

1796
01:11:33,481 --> 01:11:35,460
I think the women are a little smarter 
than that.

1797
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:37,080
They catch them off.
Right.

1798
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:39,450
Wasn't,
wasn't there a guy that was like way out

1799
01:11:39,451 --> 01:11:40,270
ahead,
uh,

1800
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:41,460
that,
that might've been the case.

1801
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:42,810
Yeah,
he dropped off.

1802
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,460
Yeah.
Keep it up.

1803
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:47,340
He was probably running way too fast for
what he was capable of doing.

1804
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:50,580
And then you see that all the time and 
it's really easy to do at 100 plus miles

1805
01:11:50,581 --> 01:11:51,414
because really at the end of the day,
like if you feel comfortable at the 

1806
01:11:53,941 --> 01:11:55,590
start,
you'll probably going to fast now.

1807
01:11:55,591 --> 01:11:57,510
How do you pace yourself and something 
like that.

1808
01:11:57,511 --> 01:11:59,520
Like what do you,
are you using your watch?

1809
01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:02,220
Are you counting steps?
Like what are you doing?

1810
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:03,353
Yeah.
Um,

1811
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:06,480
I like to get to a point where I can use
perceived effort,

1812
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:07,463
which is basically like listening to my 
body and I can know like okay this is a 

1813
01:12:10,411 --> 01:12:12,030
little too hard,
I need to dial it back.

1814
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:14,520
Um,
I'll use heart rate a lot in training to

1815
01:12:14,521 --> 01:12:18,210
kind of get myself to the fitness I'm 
looking for.

1816
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,133
Your rich roll was talking about that he
was saying that he tries to stay under 

1817
01:12:21,841 --> 01:12:24,930
one 40 or in the one 49 inch.
Yeah.

1818
01:12:24,931 --> 01:12:25,764
And the thing about heart rate that I,
where I kind of deviate from heart rate 

1819
01:12:29,581 --> 01:12:32,730
is when you start getting into these 
really long events that go past like two

1820
01:12:32,731 --> 01:12:33,564
or three hours,
heart rate starts losing its value in 

1821
01:12:35,401 --> 01:12:36,234
terms of being able to trust it as like 
a metric that's going to tell you to do 

1822
01:12:38,071 --> 01:12:38,904
the right thing.
Like there's so many things that can 

1823
01:12:40,021 --> 01:12:43,320
kind of disrupt that from like 
dehydration to just cardiac drift,

1824
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:45,330
all kinds of,
all kinds of things.

1825
01:12:45,331 --> 01:12:49,980
So I think like if an athlete really has
things dialed in that can use heart rate

1826
01:12:49,981 --> 01:12:52,080
and training and they can look at heart 
rate if they want,

1827
01:12:52,081 --> 01:12:52,914
but they also need to connect that with 
perceived effort so that if something 

1828
01:12:55,711 --> 01:12:57,930
goes wrong with that or it starts,
you know,

1829
01:12:57,931 --> 01:13:00,060
issues start coming up with the heart 
rate side of things,

1830
01:13:00,061 --> 01:13:02,940
they can still kind of like reflect back
in on themselves.

1831
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:03,241
Like,
okay,

1832
01:13:03,241 --> 01:13:04,074
this is a state sustainable pace for me.
Or this is not a sustainable pace for 

1833
01:13:06,421 --> 01:13:07,440
me.
Rich Roll,

1834
01:13:07,441 --> 01:13:08,960
we should point out is a Vegan.
Yeah.

1835
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:09,833
And you know,
he's one of the few guys that is fully 

1836
01:13:12,271 --> 01:13:13,104
functional.
It has no issues at all keeping that 

1837
01:13:14,701 --> 01:13:15,690
diet up.
Yeah.

1838
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:16,553
Yeah.
And I think he,

1839
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,450
I mean,
he puts a lot of work into that,

1840
01:13:18,451 --> 01:13:18,931
I think.
Oh,

1841
01:13:18,931 --> 01:13:19,890
you have to.
Yeah.

1842
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:22,013
I mean,
you really have to be just super 

1843
01:13:22,501 --> 01:13:23,334
dedicated to making sure you're getting 
the proper amount of nutrients and 

1844
01:13:25,381 --> 01:13:26,214
making sure you get in microbiology and 
all these different forms of b12 and 

1845
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:29,881
yeah.
Yeah.

1846
01:13:29,881 --> 01:13:31,830
And then whenever someone comes to me 
and says like,

1847
01:13:31,831 --> 01:13:33,960
I'm a Vegan,
I'm a vegetarian or something like that,

1848
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:35,010
it's like,
who should I look to?

1849
01:13:35,011 --> 01:13:37,120
And he's the,
he's the first guy I point to is like if

1850
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:38,340
there's someone doing it right,
it's him.

1851
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:40,680
So now he's definitely doing it right 
now.

1852
01:13:40,681 --> 01:13:43,140
When it comes to something like Moab to 
40,

1853
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:46,350
how does someone like courtney below 
that whole field,

1854
01:13:46,351 --> 01:13:47,730
the way like that?
Um,

1855
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,880
I think some of it is just,
that's a really new event.

1856
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,190
Like I think they're in their like third
or fourth year for two hundreds.

1857
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:55,043
There's three of them in the United 
States and they'll probably be four or 

1858
01:13:57,721 --> 01:14:01,200
five in the next couple of years.
So it really hasn't,

1859
01:14:01,201 --> 01:14:02,580
it's in its infancy.
I mean,

1860
01:14:02,581 --> 01:14:03,740
think of it like,
uh,

1861
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:06,690
like with UFC,
like back lake in the 90s,

1862
01:14:06,691 --> 01:14:08,340
like,
and then where does that today?

1863
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:11,500
So like those two hundreds or kind of 
like UFC was in the 90s.

1864
01:14:11,950 --> 01:14:13,450
And I mean,
if that becomes a thing,

1865
01:14:13,451 --> 01:14:16,690
if people start gravitating toward it,
then you're start,

1866
01:14:16,691 --> 01:14:19,210
you'll see some of these course records 
just get blown out.

1867
01:14:19,211 --> 01:14:22,060
I mean we saw that with the hundred mile
distance and you've seen that with,

1868
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,340
you know,
a lot of all the trail course records.

1869
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,760
Um,
because like a lot of fast guys and gals

1870
01:14:27,761 --> 01:14:29,080
have moved into the sport and the last 
five,

1871
01:14:29,081 --> 01:14:30,760
10 years.
So we've just been,

1872
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:31,623
it's been like just deeper talent pool,
more likely to get a complete genetic 

1873
01:14:35,321 --> 01:14:38,110
freak more likely.
And the other thing too is like,

1874
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,700
um,
a lot,

1875
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:44,050
like a lot of times what you have is you
get competitive enough in a sport then,

1876
01:14:44,051 --> 01:14:44,884
um,
people start playing with fire and 

1877
01:14:45,971 --> 01:14:46,804
training and they're doing it because 
they know they have to get to their 

1878
01:14:49,301 --> 01:14:52,720
optimal best.
And sometimes they overtrain overtrained

1879
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:53,860
get hurt and,
and then,

1880
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:58,990
but then the people that make it through
that are there as fit as they can get.

1881
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,780
So then you can see,
you can see some really good times.

1882
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,760
Do you peak for a race?
Yeah,

1883
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:04,623
definitely.
Same way a fighter would peak for a 

1884
01:15:05,991 --> 01:15:06,580
fight.
Yup.

1885
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:07,413
I'll usually pick two,
maybe three races a year and those are 

1886
01:15:09,881 --> 01:15:11,710
the ones that I'm really going to try to
nail.

1887
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:12,573
Those are the ones where like I'm gonna 
like try to do everything I can to be 

1888
01:15:16,931 --> 01:15:20,860
ready to hurt during that race.
And then I'll usually do,

1889
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:21,933
maybe it's usually ranged,
like I'll usually do about six to eight 

1890
01:15:24,161 --> 01:15:26,380
ultra marathons in a year.
And then the other ones are kind of like

1891
01:15:26,381 --> 01:15:29,720
those training races that I talked about
before or every once in a while I'll get

1892
01:15:29,721 --> 01:15:34,540
invited to a race that's like overseas 
and it's like a free trip to go to China

1893
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:37,120
or something like that.
We'll speak in birding

1894
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:38,053
during a race.
I know that a lot of ultra runners are 

1895
01:15:40,191 --> 01:15:41,024
utilizing cbd and even using edible 
marijuana while they run and that they 

1896
01:15:47,141 --> 01:15:50,900
found that this is a great performance 
enhancing.

1897
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:53,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

1898
01:15:53,561 --> 01:15:55,900
I don't know if you ever messed around 
with CBD or,

1899
01:15:56,110 --> 01:15:57,550
Yeah.
Not,

1900
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,473
not within workouts though,
like more as like a sleep aid or 

1901
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:02,770
anything but like,
or an inflammation thing.

1902
01:16:02,771 --> 01:16:07,060
So it's like more of a post war.
There was an esquire article,

1903
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:09,360
Cole or Maxim,
one of them guy,

1904
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:12,060
guy magazine type things,
and it was all about,

1905
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:12,923
uh,
marijuana and ultra running and that 

1906
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:16,680
it's,
it's somehow or another,

1907
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:17,743
uh,
become a big part of it that for a lot 

1908
01:16:20,101 --> 01:16:20,934
of these guys,

1909
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,480
yeah.
I think find a champion.

1910
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:23,081
I,
you know,

1911
01:16:23,081 --> 01:16:25,510
it's interesting because like,
you know,

1912
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,940
marijuana use,
I'm not sure about cbd,

1913
01:16:27,941 --> 01:16:31,030
but marijuana use is like,
is illegal in competition.

1914
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,160
Yeah.
It's like all of them.

1915
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:34,271
Uh,
yeah,

1916
01:16:34,271 --> 01:16:34,770
it's,
it's,

1917
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:37,750
so there's like a Usada type standard.
It's the same,

1918
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:39,760
it's the Usada Protocol.
So I think,

1919
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:40,594
I think it's like,
it has to be below a certain level for 

1920
01:16:42,581 --> 01:16:43,540
like,
that's great.

1921
01:16:43,541 --> 01:16:44,110
Then,
so they,

1922
01:16:44,110 --> 01:16:46,810
they're testing you for epo and all 
those things.

1923
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:48,003
I mean,
it's still pretty primitive and ultra 

1924
01:16:48,761 --> 01:16:49,760
running,
um,

1925
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:51,880
like there's testing at some of the big 
races,

1926
01:16:51,950 --> 01:16:53,380
uh,
and that's even relatively new,

1927
01:16:53,381 --> 01:16:55,870
like in the last year or so.
So like Western states,

1928
01:16:55,871 --> 01:16:57,540
they'll test,
they'll test a,

1929
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:00,280
the top 10 on each side and then a few 
random people.

1930
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,210
And then,
uh,

1931
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:02,043
I think ut and B,
which is the other big hundred miler I 

1932
01:17:04,861 --> 01:17:05,800
was talking about,
they tasks.

1933
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:10,010
Like I was tested after when I broke the
$12 world record in 2013.

1934
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:12,410
I got tested after that.
Um,

1935
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,630
have there been any big superstars that 
pissed hot?

1936
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:18,110
Um,
there's been people who have,

1937
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:18,973
uh,
they weren't like individuals that were 

1938
01:17:22,071 --> 01:17:24,900
like kind of like a poster child of the 
sport necessarily though.

1939
01:17:24,901 --> 01:17:26,110
Lamps,
Lance Armstrong,

1940
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:28,130
nothing,
nothing like that.

1941
01:17:28,131 --> 01:17:28,860
So,
um,

1942
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:31,130
and it's,
it's really interesting because like,

1943
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:34,130
I mean there's certainly people skirting
the rules and ultra marathon running.

1944
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:35,810
Um,
I have no doubt about it,

1945
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:38,300
but I think they're doing,
uh,

1946
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,330
probably like,
what is it?

1947
01:17:41,331 --> 01:17:42,510
Uh,
I dealt,

1948
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:45,610
they're doing like blood transfusion,
things like Tour de France talk.

1949
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:48,050
Cause I mean that's an expensive hard 
thing to kind of put together.

1950
01:17:48,051 --> 01:17:50,240
You need a doctor essentially,
if I'm understanding it.

1951
01:17:50,241 --> 01:17:51,074
All right.
So they're probably just doing little 

1952
01:17:52,461 --> 01:17:53,294
like minor things,
like maybe like peptides or something 

1953
01:17:55,701 --> 01:17:56,840
like that would be my guess.

1954
01:17:57,750 --> 01:18:01,320
But I also do think it's not nearly like
people,

1955
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:04,250
I think nowadays it would like with 
Icarus and all that stuff,

1956
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:05,413
like now people are on the opposite side
of what they were a few years ago where 

1957
01:18:07,971 --> 01:18:08,804
they,
they suspect everyone's doing it versus 

1958
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,130
I know they're not doing it.
They haven't gotten caught yet,

1959
01:18:13,131 --> 01:18:14,660
which is where we were probably a few 
years ago.

1960
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:16,490
Um,
in ultra running.

1961
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:18,230
I think,
I think the culture plays a huge role in

1962
01:18:18,231 --> 01:18:19,064
that.
I mean like when you had lance on and 

1963
01:18:20,181 --> 01:18:21,014
they get,
he was pretty good about talking about 

1964
01:18:22,641 --> 01:18:23,930
like how like,
you know,

1965
01:18:23,931 --> 01:18:24,764
like you come into the sport,
you go over to Europe to race and like 

1966
01:18:27,801 --> 01:18:29,570
they asked you to get on a protocol.
If you say no,

1967
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:30,404
they send you back.
Like it's like that's a cultural thing 

1968
01:18:32,751 --> 01:18:33,584
then to like let it gets like you,
you have to do it to be in this sport 

1969
01:18:36,441 --> 01:18:38,900
almost in with ultra running.
I just kind of the opposite.

1970
01:18:38,901 --> 01:18:40,220
I think.
Um,

1971
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:43,010
I think the culture is stay away from 
that stuff.

1972
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:44,330
Like,
like we don't,

1973
01:18:44,331 --> 01:18:45,260
we don't want that

1974
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:47,930
because it's a mind thing almost more 
than anything,

1975
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:48,764
which is why people like courtney who 
aren't maybe the fastest marathon 

1976
01:18:51,321 --> 01:18:52,154
runners but have this just bulletproof 
mind that allows them to compete and 

1977
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:58,213
that you really,
there's no supplement for your mind for 

1978
01:19:00,450 --> 01:19:01,270
willpower.

1979
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:02,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

1980
01:19:02,290 --> 01:19:05,680
And there's things that can go wrong 
just from the duration you're out there.

1981
01:19:06,430 --> 01:19:07,420
Yeah,
I can imagine.

1982
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:08,463
I mean it seems to be so much of it 
seems to be your ability to deal with 

1983
01:19:11,771 --> 01:19:14,290
discomfort and pain and just press on.

1984
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:15,160
Yeah.
It,

1985
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:15,993
you know,
the way I describe ultra marathon 

1986
01:19:16,721 --> 01:19:18,580
running is it's still a running sport.

1987
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:19,723
See runner's high.
The athletes use marijuana to improve 

1988
01:19:21,951 --> 01:19:23,000
their training.
What was that in?

1989
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:26,040
Was it in the Guardian?
I taught both of those and yet,

1990
01:19:26,041 --> 01:19:26,874
but guardian stone,
marathon runners may seem like walking 

1991
01:19:29,841 --> 01:19:30,674
contradictions,
but there are hints that the drug and 

1992
01:19:32,571 --> 01:19:34,550
long distance running could go hand in 
hand.

1993
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:35,413
I'll tell you what,
man,

1994
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,300
I've only done it a few times where I 
got super baked and went running.

1995
01:19:38,301 --> 01:19:42,020
It feels awesome.
It feels great to feel so scared though.

1996
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:42,800
Like,
ah,

1997
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:47,800
what am I doing?
But I would imagine for some people it's

1998
01:19:48,070 --> 01:19:49,930
a,
you know,

1999
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,390
euphoric,
50% of the runners are meaner,

2000
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,510
avid cannabis user to say almost none of
them are open about it says avery.

2001
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:57,660
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2002
01:19:57,670 --> 01:20:00,720
Avery Collins is,
he's interesting because he's,

2003
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:03,420
he's a spokesperson for marijuana use 
and you know,

2004
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:04,561
like,
I mean,

2005
01:20:04,561 --> 01:20:05,394
I don't,
you don't have to look far into like 

2006
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:08,873
marijuana and how it got to be where it 
is in terms of its legality or 

2007
01:20:13,051 --> 01:20:16,920
illegality to recognize there are some 
tomfoolery going on there.

2008
01:20:16,921 --> 01:20:18,150
Like,
I mean,

2009
01:20:18,151 --> 01:20:20,500
you don't have to be like a historian to
find out like,

2010
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:23,760
like why that's criminalized world,
whereas alcohol isn't,

2011
01:20:23,761 --> 01:20:24,594
and that sort of sorta thing.
And Avery's been like a pretty big 

2012
01:20:27,241 --> 01:20:29,240
proponent about kind of,
uh,

2013
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,380
de stigmatizing it.
Um,

2014
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:32,700
and,
but you know,

2015
01:20:32,701 --> 01:20:33,534
he understands,
at least he understands that it's 

2016
01:20:35,821 --> 01:20:36,654
illegal and competition.
And I think he's been tested at least 

2017
01:20:38,491 --> 01:20:40,590
twice after races.
I mean,

2018
01:20:40,591 --> 01:20:42,630
he was six that western states last 
year.

2019
01:20:42,631 --> 01:20:45,540
So he had gotten tested for that.
And Caffeine,

2020
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:47,640
illegal and competition?
No.

2021
01:20:47,710 --> 01:20:49,800
Um,
I think at a certain level,

2022
01:20:49,801 --> 01:20:51,480
I think it is,
although they may have just removed it,

2023
01:20:51,481 --> 01:20:52,830
I'm trying to remember if I saw that 
right.

2024
01:20:52,831 --> 01:20:57,831
But it used to be like you can have 
caffeine but at a certain level it would

2025
01:20:58,471 --> 01:20:59,304
be illegal but it was like the 
equivalent of like 16 cups of coffee or 

2026
01:21:01,381 --> 01:21:02,214
something like that.
So you'd have to put down like four of 

2027
01:21:03,921 --> 01:21:04,754
those Nitros

2028
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:07,260
nitros right before your race if you 
wanted any,

2029
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:08,363
any chance of going over that.
And you probably go into cardiac arrest 

2030
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:13,800
before anyway and by the time you got to
the end of the race he would probably be

2031
01:21:13,801 --> 01:21:15,600
out of your system anyway.
Well,

2032
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:16,860
it's interesting,
I actually,

2033
01:21:16,861 --> 01:21:17,160
this is

2034
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,570
diverging a little bit,
but I,

2035
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:22,710
I read a story a while ago that there 
was some high school kid who was playing

2036
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:23,544
football and he like slammed a red bull 
or some one of those like high caffeine 

2037
01:21:27,901 --> 01:21:28,734
energy drinks and then like was like on 
the kick return team or something 

2038
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:34,860
returned to kick for touchdown,
was just jacked out of his mind,

2039
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:37,200
slammed another one and then went back 
on the field and had a heart

2040
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:38,083
tack or something like,
I'm sure it could happen is you go too 

2041
01:21:40,291 --> 01:21:42,300
hard.
It's not just caffeine.

2042
01:21:42,301 --> 01:21:43,134
Right.
A lot of those things have a bunch of 

2043
01:21:43,561 --> 01:21:44,660
other worlds.
Once it,

2044
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:46,710
I'm too,
you remember red lines?

2045
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,630
Oh yeah.
I took one of those ones.

2046
01:21:48,631 --> 01:21:50,570
I drank the whole bottle and then I 
looked at it,

2047
01:21:50,571 --> 01:21:52,050
it says like four servings.
I'm like,

2048
01:21:52,051 --> 01:21:52,884
Oh shit.
Well servings like 150 milligrams of 

2049
01:21:55,561 --> 01:21:56,640
caffeine or something.
Nuts.

2050
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:57,481
Yeah.
Well,

2051
01:21:57,481 --> 01:21:58,314
and then they put a bunch of other 
stimulants in there that people don't 

2052
01:21:59,461 --> 01:22:00,660
know about,
so yeah.

2053
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,940
Tarin and all sorts of other shit in 
there.

2054
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:03,793
Yeah,
yeah,

2055
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,153
yeah.
The kind of those pre workout 

2056
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,660
supplements were kind of wild.
Yeah.

2057
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:11,400
Oh,
remember those a ripped fuel.

2058
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:13,920
I took rip fuel once and went to a 
Jujitsu class.

2059
01:22:13,921 --> 01:22:15,780
I had to stop.
I had to stop training.

2060
01:22:15,781 --> 01:22:16,310
I'm like,
I'm,

2061
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:18,240
I'm,
my heart is beating so fast.

2062
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,730
I could die here.
Like this is,

2063
01:22:20,150 --> 01:22:21,960
this is not good.
And that was right before they pulled it

2064
01:22:21,961 --> 01:22:24,780
off the market.
Cut It in just in time.

2065
01:22:24,781 --> 01:22:27,000
I guess it was the other thing they 
pulled off the market too,

2066
01:22:27,001 --> 01:22:29,700
that was killing people.
Was it called Jack Three D.

2067
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:30,360
Oh,
okay.

2068
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:31,730
I think I remember hearing them.
Yeah,

2069
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:32,281
yeah,
yeah.

2070
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:33,900
They,
that killed a few folks.

2071
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,270
I think it killed a few folks in the 
military.

2072
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:37,463
So you know,
you're not talking about like some 

2073
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:40,700
fucking sickly old man's like,
I don't know,

2074
01:22:40,701 --> 01:22:43,730
have to get a truck.
It's like fucking soldiers.

2075
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:44,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

2076
01:22:45,150 --> 01:22:46,710
I mean,
I'll use caffeine in races.

2077
01:22:46,770 --> 01:22:47,603
I think it's pretty clear that caffeine 
is a performance enhancing and it just 

2078
01:22:49,591 --> 01:22:50,424
happens to be one that's equally,
that's legal and some mild performance 

2079
01:22:52,921 --> 01:22:56,910
enhancing and using coffee or taking 
pills

2080
01:22:56,990 --> 01:22:59,870
a little.
I've done a variety of different things.

2081
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:02,240
Um,
in I've done,

2082
01:23:02,290 --> 01:23:03,123
uh,
I did a race once where I was trying to 

2083
01:23:05,921 --> 01:23:10,921
figure out like my fueling rate and like
kind of what was ideal,

2084
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:12,513
and this was a while ago,
but I did 100 k race and I did nothing 

2085
01:23:15,941 --> 01:23:18,330
but mountain dew and it was like,
wow.

2086
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:19,263
I think I took in,
it ended up coming out to about 158 

2087
01:23:22,451 --> 01:23:24,870
calories an hour of just mountain dew 
with some luck.

2088
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:26,770
I added some electro lights too.
I feel like if you,

2089
01:23:26,771 --> 01:23:28,360
if you're just sitting around doing 
nothing,

2090
01:23:28,361 --> 01:23:30,040
mountain dews probably terrible for you 
for sure.

2091
01:23:30,041 --> 01:23:33,610
If you're running hills and really 
kicking ass like that,

2092
01:23:33,611 --> 01:23:35,300
the amount of fuel you're burning.
Yeah,

2093
01:23:35,301 --> 01:23:37,750
mountain dew might be a great move if 
you don't go overboard.

2094
01:23:37,751 --> 01:23:39,640
I mean,
so does that every aid station at pretty

2095
01:23:39,641 --> 01:23:40,474
much every race?

2096
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,250
Yeah.
So it's definitely something people have

2097
01:23:42,251 --> 01:23:45,490
identified as useful.
But like since then I've been a,

2098
01:23:45,670 --> 01:23:48,130
that product was talking about before 
the x and fuel five.

2099
01:23:48,131 --> 01:23:49,780
They make one with a little caffeine in 
it too.

2100
01:23:49,870 --> 01:23:51,400
So now I'll usually,
if I want to caffeine,

2101
01:23:51,401 --> 01:23:53,500
I'll just use that instead of the non 
caffeinated one.

2102
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:56,200
Um,
but then I'll do like,

2103
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,233
you know,
I'll still sometimes do a little bit of 

2104
01:23:58,031 --> 01:23:59,500
Soda,
especially at the end of the race.

2105
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,353
Um,
just to kind of change things up a 

2106
01:24:00,851 --> 01:24:02,770
little bit.
Cause that's the other thing too is like

2107
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:04,750
if you do the same thing,
you know,

2108
01:24:04,751 --> 01:24:06,580
after a while it's like,
just give me something different.

2109
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:09,670
Yeah.
Well I know floyd mayweather drinks soda

2110
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,470
after he works out.
Oh really?

2111
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:12,110
Yeah.
And,

2112
01:24:12,110 --> 01:24:13,600
and people were like,
what an idiot.

2113
01:24:13,601 --> 01:24:16,030
And I was like,
maybe not first of all,

2114
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,890
maybe the best boxer of all time.

2115
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:19,900
So definitely not an idiot.
He's doing something right.

2116
01:24:19,901 --> 01:24:23,140
He's doing something right and if he's 
that good on top of,

2117
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,880
you know,
having a terrible diet,

2118
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:28,210
I think part of his like terrible diet 
as a joke.

2119
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:31,390
Like he'll eat cheeseburgers and shit 
and show you and say,

2120
01:24:31,391 --> 01:24:32,224
look motherfucker,
I'm kicking everybody's ass eating 

2121
01:24:32,981 --> 01:24:35,230
cheeseburgers.
But not really.

2122
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:37,780
He really does help them when the chefs 
making some gourmet meal,

2123
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,450
I mean,
he has a personal chef.

2124
01:24:40,451 --> 01:24:42,010
There was a whole article about it 
recently,

2125
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:43,083
but I think that the fueling up with 
like really heavy sugary drinks after a 

2126
01:24:47,771 --> 01:24:48,604
very hard workout,
it's not a bad idea to replenish the 

2127
01:24:51,371 --> 01:24:53,020
glycogen in your muscles.
Yeah,

2128
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:55,000
I think that depends.
I think like,

2129
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:58,570
I think the science is pretty clear if 
you're on a high carbohydrate or a least

2130
01:24:58,571 --> 01:25:00,910
a higher carbohydrate diet that you 
know,

2131
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:03,470
carbohydrate and protein within like,
you know,

2132
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:04,953
30,
45 minutes of the post workout is going 

2133
01:25:06,421 --> 01:25:09,490
to be in your best interest of people 
like chocolate milk for that.

2134
01:25:09,490 --> 01:25:10,630
Right?
Yeah.

2135
01:25:10,631 --> 01:25:11,464
That's gotten,
that's gotten kind of like labeled as 

2136
01:25:13,511 --> 01:25:17,590
that perfect ratio of a protein with 
shittier sugar.

2137
01:25:17,591 --> 01:25:18,311
Yep.
Where,

2138
01:25:18,311 --> 01:25:19,144
where it's not clear or at least it's,
it's getting clearer is like where the 

2139
01:25:22,961 --> 01:25:26,740
variants there is for someone like 
myself who following a high fat approach

2140
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:30,850
and we have added a little bit of a 
glimpse into it from some studies.

2141
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:32,043
Uh,
and I,

2142
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:36,100
the interesting thing is what they did 
this one study called a faster study,

2143
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:38,140
um,
and it looked at,

2144
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:39,003
uh,
like it was 10 guys who are on a high 

2145
01:25:40,751 --> 01:25:45,160
fat diet and 10 guys from on a high 
carbohydrate diet and the guys on the,

2146
01:25:45,310 --> 01:25:46,143
they tried to pair them up as twin,
so like similar like performance 

2147
01:25:48,911 --> 01:25:49,744
achievements,
a similar like body metrics and then 

2148
01:25:52,301 --> 01:25:54,700
kind of compare the two in the high fat 
cohort.

2149
01:25:54,701 --> 01:25:55,534
Actually when they finished the,
one of the workouts was a three hour 

2150
01:25:58,931 --> 01:25:59,764
treadmill session and then they were,
they taken like blood tests and stuff 

2151
01:26:02,531 --> 01:26:06,110
and they had like the oxygen mask and 
things like throughout the course of it.

2152
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:09,050
And they tested things before or after.
Um,

2153
01:26:09,650 --> 01:26:11,900
and one thing that they saw was like,
uh,

2154
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:12,813
the,
the high fat folks actually had this 

2155
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:17,960
kind of big like surge of glucose in the
bloodstream post workout.

2156
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:19,333
So the thought is like,
you might not want to double down on 

2157
01:26:22,221 --> 01:26:25,670
that if you're in a fat adapted state 
because like,

2158
01:26:25,730 --> 01:26:26,900
I mean,
some of the levels,

2159
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:28,490
this is,
it goes back to,

2160
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:29,353
it would have been like,
like this is what something I'd like to 

2161
01:26:31,011 --> 01:26:33,460
ask a doctor a tia about.
Um,

2162
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:37,520
is that like you get these big kind of 
post workout,

2163
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:41,630
like blood glucose spikes sometimes to 
the level of like what would look like a

2164
01:26:41,631 --> 01:26:43,410
type two diabetic.
Um,

2165
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,020
but it's not,
it's not,

2166
01:26:45,021 --> 01:26:45,854
it's,
it's in a different context than what 

2167
01:26:46,671 --> 01:26:49,190
you would see in someone who's just like
following a normal diet where that would

2168
01:26:49,191 --> 01:26:50,180
be kind of a red flag.

2169
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:51,570
And,
um,

2170
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:52,873
so like to,
to hit the body with another source of 

2171
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:59,450
glucose essentially might not be 
affecting you the same way.

2172
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:00,991
So yeah,
it's,

2173
01:27:00,991 --> 01:27:02,150
it's,
it's interesting stuff.

2174
01:27:02,151 --> 01:27:03,920
So like,
it's actually like,

2175
01:27:04,190 --> 01:27:05,023
um,
what I've done sometimes too is after a 

2176
01:27:06,081 --> 01:27:07,580
big hard workout,
if I'm not hungry,

2177
01:27:07,581 --> 01:27:10,040
I don't always eat right away.
I wait for my stomach to come around and

2178
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:11,540
like my body to say,
you're hungry.

2179
01:27:11,870 --> 01:27:13,910
Just to let all that stuff kind of go 
through.

2180
01:27:13,911 --> 01:27:15,450
And then,
then I'll have a,

2181
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:17,810
depending on,
depending on what I'm doing next,

2182
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:18,860
like all,
if I'm,

2183
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:21,230
if I'm taking an easy day or a couple of
easy days,

2184
01:27:21,231 --> 01:27:24,650
I'll go like really low carb.
But if I'm going back out that afternoon

2185
01:27:24,651 --> 01:27:25,484
for another workout or the next morning 
for like a speed session or something 

2186
01:27:28,401 --> 01:27:30,140
out,
that's when maybe I would try to drop in

2187
01:27:30,141 --> 01:27:33,500
a little bit of carbohydrate to kind of 
speed up the glycogen,

2188
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:34,790
uh,
side of things.

2189
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:36,650
So I'm ready for that next one.
Well,

2190
01:27:36,651 --> 01:27:38,460
Zach,
you're a bad mother fucker.

2191
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:39,433
I wish you all the best and I really 
appreciate you coming down here and 

2192
01:27:40,911 --> 01:27:43,370
talking to us and it's a fascinating 
what you do,

2193
01:27:43,371 --> 01:27:45,200
man.
Thanks for having me on.

2194
01:27:45,201 --> 01:27:46,070
Thank you.
Thank you very much,

2195
01:27:46,071 --> 01:27:46,904
man.
Thank you.
