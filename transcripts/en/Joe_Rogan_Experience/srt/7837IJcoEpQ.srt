1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,573
it's going to happen,

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,230
but there's always going
to be good people that do.

4
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,280
They're always have bins from
Amelia Earhart to fill in the blank.

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,510
All throughout history has always been
women that have figured out a way to

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,580
achieve and do things that they really,

7
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:15,660
truly enjoy doing.

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,770
Like our flight attendant,

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,450
we got hijacked for the longest time
I've ever been hijacked as an adult.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,450
Oh No.

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,180
Tommy and I were having a fun little
conversation and we ordered a little glass

12
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:37,000
of wine because were gentlemen
and we're on a business trip.

13
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,850
We decided to have a little
wine and we're sitting there,

14
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:40,151
uh,

15
00:00:40,151 --> 00:00:44,620
and the woman came over and she made a
joke about the temperature of the wine

16
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,080
and I made the mistake of going,

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:47,800
um,

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,030
is it like you're apologizing?

19
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,661
It's too cold.

20
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:50,111
That's funny.

21
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:51,910
I've never heard anybody
apologize of wine.

22
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:52,421
It's too cold.

23
00:00:52,421 --> 00:00:52,601
She goes,

24
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:53,020
whoa.

25
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,201
Well,

26
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:54,720
if you remember the scene from sideways,

27
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:54,800
he,

28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,320
I've never really been much into one.

29
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,180
The only time I drink wine is in church,

30
00:00:58,181 --> 00:01:00,520
but there's a funny thing about wine.

31
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:05,440
I knew a guy and the guy
was a wine connoisseur and
they brought him a bottle of

32
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:06,221
wine and said,

33
00:01:06,221 --> 00:01:08,050
should we put this in the refrigerator?

34
00:01:08,051 --> 00:01:08,521
You strict,

35
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:10,690
don't you touch it and put
it in the refrigerator.

36
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,360
Don't you put a hand on that
wine and bringing their voice?

37
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,980
I thought it was so funny,

38
00:01:14,981 --> 00:01:15,850
but of course I don't drink.

39
00:01:15,851 --> 00:01:16,800
The only time I drink it a drunk.

40
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,960
And he went on and on and on.

41
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,853
Yes.

42
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,200
To the point where I was lucky
because I was in the window.

43
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,550
So I just abandoned Tommy.

44
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,960
I lifted up the window and I put my face
to the glass and then I reached into my

45
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:35,220
lap,

46
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:35,780
talk bad.

47
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,480
But I pulled up,

48
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,500
pulled out my notepad and I started
writing down and I wrote in my note pad,

49
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,020
the flight attendant
won't shut the fuck up.

50
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,500
Yeah,

51
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,630
I wrote that in my notes.

52
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,600
I started writing it in front of her too.

53
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,530
Yes.

54
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:48,711
Well,

55
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:49,341
first of all,

56
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:50,690
she came out when she came over,

57
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:50,961
she goes,

58
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:51,890
do you want something to drink?

59
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,851
I said,

60
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:53,160
yeah.

61
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,650
Um,

62
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,483
do you have Pinot Noir?

63
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,940
Which is not that crazy to say,

64
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:56,930
no,

65
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,530
we have cab door won't shut the fuck up.

66
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,151
She's like,

67
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:03,170
this has to be addressed.

68
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,070
When I said,

69
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:05,360
do you have chemo in war?

70
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,351
She goes,

71
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:06,950
uh,

72
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,783
excuse me,

73
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,750
and I go,

74
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,211
peanut nor,

75
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:09,830
she goes,

76
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,000
do you think you're in Leone,

77
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:11,834
France?

78
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,590
And I was like,

79
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,423
no,

80
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,361
it's not.

81
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:14,521
Yeah,

82
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:15,354
it's not crazy.

83
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,520
And she was like,

84
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:17,450
we got red or white.

85
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,201
And I was like,

86
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:18,471
all right,

87
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,280
red.

88
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,870
And then when she came back,

89
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,690
it was sideways.

90
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,000
It was the summer.

91
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:25,341
Yay.

92
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:26,240
At Macy's,

93
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,070
who when I worked at the hospital,

94
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,900
they brought him the wine and he said,

95
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:30,734
should I chill this?

96
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,930
And we're talking about
the most boring sentences.

97
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,513
Oh yeah,

98
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,031
these were,

99
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:39,950
these were incredibly boring census.

100
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:40,784
The worst.

101
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,893
Oh God.

102
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,430
When she left,

103
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,530
when she left and we go like,

104
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:46,730
what the fuck was that?

105
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,373
She left,

106
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,590
she came back and I just made,

107
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,670
I just looked up.

108
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:53,210
She goes,

109
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,490
did you ever see the
movie Simon [inaudible]?

110
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,163
She was like,

111
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,030
my favorite scene and
that has a wine scene.

112
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,123
And I was like,

113
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:00,731
all right.

114
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:01,810
She goes and I,

115
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,830
this is when I zoned out,

116
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:06,700
she was like Bruce Willis and [inaudible]
and she was like not all right,

117
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:07,490
all the wine fall.

118
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,470
I know it's a great scene.

119
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,160
And I was like,

120
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,993
she wouldn't stop.

121
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,850
And you know what's really
fascinating before this happened,

122
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,900
before this happened,

123
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,140
Tommy nailed her personality
cause we may or may not have had

124
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,170
before we got on that plane.

125
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,610
And so we were uh,

126
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,030
it was just starting to kick
in and mid flight and he goes,

127
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:28,864
you know when I think,

128
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,130
I think that they put her on this small
plane because she can't work well with

129
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:36,580
others and that the other students
is don't like working with her.

130
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,100
So they stick her on these
small planes cause she doesn't,

131
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:40,330
she doesn't want to be around anybody.

132
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:43,090
She's probably been doing this a long
time and they know that she doesn't work

133
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:43,924
well with others.

134
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,640
And then she came over and just right
away gave us the ferocious ERBD.

135
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,430
Yes,

136
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,920
it was an ear beating was also,

137
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,510
she gave us an ear beating on church,

138
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,010
shutting off the phones to like everything
else about her phone pressing this

139
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:01,640
button and we didn't have our phones on.

140
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:02,920
It's not like we were resisting,

141
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:03,641
we shut our phones off,

142
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:05,350
but she did it for the whole thing.

143
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:07,630
Like this is what I want you to do,

144
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:07,900
right?

145
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,040
You see this button?

146
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,540
I want you to press this button,

147
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,370
not an airplane mode folks,

148
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,540
not an airplane mode.

149
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,740
I want you to shut this button.

150
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:15,574
If you have an iPhone,

151
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,610
I want you to slide that
over the to shut it off.

152
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,593
And I mean,

153
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,900
she's going on and on and on
it taking a long ass time.

154
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,480
And if you wanted to read
a book or if you wanted to,

155
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:25,991
you know,

156
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:27,130
listen to your Ipod,

157
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:27,940
eh,

158
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,900
that's not happening.

159
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:29,111
No,

160
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:33,700
you're dealing with this nonsense you're
dealing with and you can't even fight

161
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:36,610
against that nonsense because if
you argue at all about anything,

162
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:37,570
they kick you off the plane.

163
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:37,870
Yep.

164
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,703
She's got the power.

165
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,100
I had a friend that kicked off the plane
because he was upset that they didn't

166
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:44,440
find a seat for his son next to him.

167
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,900
Like they didn't find anybody
that was willing to move.

168
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,690
It was an hour and a half flight
from San Francisco to Seattle.

169
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,700
It's a quick ass flight and they,

170
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,241
you know,

171
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:52,810
he said,

172
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,230
is there,

173
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:53,950
is it possible?

174
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,431
She was like,

175
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:55,240
sir,

176
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,020
we've tried.

177
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,741
There's nothing we can do.

178
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:56,981
He goes,

179
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:58,300
I have a five year old though.

180
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:58,811
Like,

181
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:00,280
why did you guys sell me a ticket?

182
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:01,600
I told you it was five years old.

183
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,520
You can't have a five
year old sit by himself.

184
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:03,800
He's,

185
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,590
he's terrified of flying
in the first choice.

186
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,330
Like all I'm asking is someone,

187
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:09,550
if you ask if someone could switch seats,

188
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:10,990
and she said,

189
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:11,380
sir,

190
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,161
I've tried.

191
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:13,060
There's nothing we can do.

192
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:14,020
Please take your seat.

193
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,071
And he was like,

194
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:18,130
you guys are the most
unfathomably friendly airline.

195
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,060
Like you guys are horrible.

196
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:19,930
I can't believe you're doing this.

197
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,950
So that's all he says.

198
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,250
He goes and sits down and the
fucking captain comes up to him,

199
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:24,410
said,

200
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:24,580
sir,

201
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,680
you going to have to come off the same.

202
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,580
They say you're aggressive and you're,

203
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:28,481
and he was like,

204
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:29,314
what?

205
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:29,681
He goes,

206
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:30,041
you've got to be,

207
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:30,874
you must be joking.

208
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,271
He goes,

209
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:33,850
all I asked is if they could
find a seat for my son.

210
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:35,050
I didn't use profanity.

211
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,490
I didn't raise my voice.

212
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:36,940
I said,

213
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,930
you guys are the most unfairly
friendly airline that I've ever seen.

214
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:41,861
That's all I said,

215
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:44,380
because you weren't even
willing to look for someone.

216
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,660
And they kicked him off
the plane and he was like,

217
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:47,381
I can't believe this.

218
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:47,591
He goes,

219
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:48,460
I'm not aggressive.

220
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,110
They,

221
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,500
but we saw that was it.

222
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:51,580
You and I that saw that?

223
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,910
Who did we see?

224
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:53,260
We,

225
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,130
we on a plane,

226
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:55,950
we saw two guys arguing about the,

227
00:05:55,951 --> 00:05:56,784
the been,

228
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,393
um,

229
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,600
I don't know with me on that one,

230
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,300
people kicked out.

231
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,133
It might've been Ra.

232
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,490
I've seen a lady to get
kicked off or having attitude,

233
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,570
um,

234
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,830
about like her whole day.

235
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,530
And she was like,

236
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:07,680
Hey,

237
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,810
you put me later on this shit.

238
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,090
And now me and him talking about
it and she was just complaining,

239
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:11,391
complaining,

240
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:11,811
complaining,

241
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:12,380
and you know,

242
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,630
she was I think aggressive
speaking to them.

243
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,040
Boom boot.

244
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:21,070
And I saw one who got kicked her whole
family off and she had small children.

245
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:23,660
She was breastfeeding one of them.

246
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,010
And they were like,

247
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,170
we're going to taxi now and you need to,

248
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,200
you know,

249
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,450
why did she get kicked off?

250
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,660
She gave the lady attitude about the
flight attendant attitude when the flight

251
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:35,744
attendant asked her,

252
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,613
um,

253
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,740
I don't know if she asked her to stop
breastfeeding while we were going to taxi,

254
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,690
but she told her like,

255
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,231
you know,

256
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:45,800
why don't you just worry about the
drinks while I'm breastfeeding?

257
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:46,963
And they were like,

258
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:47,570
ah.

259
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,760
And then we stopped and they actually,

260
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:50,121
that one,

261
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:52,250
they had police come out to the,

262
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:52,700
uh,

263
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,051
to the point,

264
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:53,760
he didn't go back.

265
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,460
The police came out,

266
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,120
they opened the door.

267
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,660
They just get off on
the power is absolutely.

268
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,950
I think sometimes,

269
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,320
uh,

270
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,580
I think sometimes they,

271
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:06,230
they absolutely want to protect
themselves and they have to,

272
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:06,621
you know,

273
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:08,780
you can't have somebody who's a,

274
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,140
an actual threat right.

275
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:10,974
The flight,

276
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,810
but I think,

277
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,740
I think there's definitely a thrill and
knowing that if somebody gives you kind

278
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:16,670
of a little jab,

279
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,660
kind of a little attitude,

280
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:18,020
you can be like,

281
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,280
I could fuck up your day right now.

282
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:19,701
Yeah,

283
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:20,030
pretty,

284
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,710
pretty badly and I can justify it.

285
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,180
And we were talking about that,

286
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,580
that this ability to hijack you.

287
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:29,180
It's kind of the same thing
because in a normal scenario,

288
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,100
you don't have to listen to this person.

289
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:32,600
You're not stuck in a chair,

290
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,270
literally strapped in with a fucking belt.

291
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:35,990
Yeah.

292
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,990
But you have to listen and then they
can just hover over you and just shit in

293
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:42,644
your face,

294
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,620
your headphones on in your
hood and your glasses.

295
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:51,770
That's why I do that in the middle of
a conversation when you're having a

296
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:55,400
conversation with another guy and then
you're having a wine and then all of a

297
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:55,731
sudden,

298
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:56,121
boom,

299
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:56,750
you're stuck.

300
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,583
The glasses,

301
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,220
I don't know if you remember
the glasses where these,

302
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,900
they're like tasting glasses.

303
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:01,920
They weren't very small,

304
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,783
very small.

305
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:08,130
And the first time I had two
sips and his empty and she goes,

306
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,003
you one refill.

307
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:09,751
And I go,

308
00:08:09,751 --> 00:08:09,931
yeah.

309
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:10,250
She goes,

310
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:10,380
oh,

311
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,960
I had a couple of drinkers
up here and I was like,

312
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,221
it's Kinda like,

313
00:08:14,221 --> 00:08:14,670
you know,

314
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,010
I can see a certain person,

315
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,030
not me personally,

316
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:22,710
but I could see that comment really
setting somebody off the the outside

317
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,300
implication of like,

318
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,670
wait a couple of drunk.

319
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,280
I don't want to say no,

320
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,000
no,

321
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,630
no need to say anymore
than we already said.

322
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,730
We already got to curl.

323
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:31,781
Poor Lady.

324
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:33,400
She's lonely and she
wants to talk to people.

325
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,563
Jesus Christ,

326
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,860
a couple of assholes.

327
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,753
That's okay.

328
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,661
I feel,

329
00:08:37,661 --> 00:08:38,620
I don't feel right about it,

330
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,980
but don't you think it's an
inability to read social cues?

331
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,840
Yes.

332
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,011
Oh,

333
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:43,690
there's no doubt.

334
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,311
She has no doubt.

335
00:08:44,311 --> 00:08:45,011
Arrow ability.

336
00:08:45,011 --> 00:08:46,570
She wasn't good at it or she didn't care.

337
00:08:46,571 --> 00:08:47,440
She just wanted to talk.

338
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:48,881
Who knows?

339
00:08:48,881 --> 00:08:49,450
You know,

340
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,770
a lot of people by the way,

341
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,380
are a little pilled up and
they don't even know that.

342
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:56,550
You don't want them to talk to
you like there's some every piece.

343
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,350
Everything's going to be okay folks.

344
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,230
Here's a few of those people
that are an antidepressant.

345
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,073
The fuck up,

346
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,140
super duper common.

347
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,230
If you look at the number
of prescriptions sold,

348
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,090
the number of anti a
antidepressant prescriptions
that are sold in this country

349
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:12,630
every year,

350
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,490
it's staggering.

351
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,470
I believe it's like 30 million,

352
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,720
30 million people in it.

353
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,300
Let me see.

354
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,860
Let's see how many people
are on antidepressants?

355
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:20,491
Let's just guess.

356
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:21,810
I'm saying it's about 30 million.

357
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,560
Yeah.

358
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,580
I think I remember that book.

359
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:26,640
PROZAC nation was that in the
nineties that's when they started it.

360
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,623
It's exploded.

361
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,780
Everyone was on Prozac
and such a huge industry.

362
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,111
I know.

363
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:33,150
I know a handful of people
have a friend on PROZAC.

364
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,583
Good guy too.

365
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,423
Great Guy.

366
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,780
Astounding increase in
antidepressant use by Americans.

367
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:41,580
I Harvard University study,

368
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:46,200
Harvard health publications from Harvard
Medical School where you could just

369
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:46,801
smoke weed,

370
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:47,280
right.

371
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,690
People 12 and over.

372
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:52,500
Increased by almost 400%

373
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,043
hmm.

374
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,140
Wow.

375
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,420
Between 1988 to 1994 and
then from 2005 to 2008

376
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,390
yeah.

377
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,410
That's incredible.

378
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,520
Holy Shit.

379
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:12,670
23% of all people on antidepressants are
women in their forties and fifties no,

380
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:13,731
no,

381
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:13,940
no.

382
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,660
Excuse me.

383
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,010
23% of women in their forties and
fifties are on antidepressants.

384
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,630
Menopause for,

385
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:21,823
yeah,

386
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,780
3% holy shit.

387
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,000
You're going through the change in life,

388
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,240
a higher percentage than any
other group by age or sex.

389
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:30,410
Just stop and think about that.

390
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:35,360
23% of women in their forties and fifties
are on a pill that keeps him happy.

391
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,410
Statistically.

392
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,230
That's a really good chance that our
flight attendant is one of those pieces.

393
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,220
That's what I'm saying.

394
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:40,790
Yeah,

395
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,570
that's what I'm saying.

396
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:41,841
Look,

397
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:45,470
I had a friend that was on it and one of
the things he said to me was that when

398
00:10:45,471 --> 00:10:45,980
he was on it,

399
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,820
nothing bothered him.

400
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,320
He was on Zoloft and he's like,

401
00:10:48,321 --> 00:10:49,190
nothing bothers me.

402
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,640
Nothing doesn't conveys me now.

403
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,670
Everything's fine.

404
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,253
Nothing bothers me.

405
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:54,620
Yeah,

406
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,570
and those kinds of people that they don't,

407
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,710
they don't see things coming,

408
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,230
so they're not aware
that they're being weird.

409
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,290
I wonder what it would interesting
obviously won't happen,

410
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:07,490
but to hear what her version
of that dialogue would be.

411
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,533
You know what I mean?

412
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,950
It's also kind of like,

413
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,120
it was great talking to those guys.

414
00:11:11,121 --> 00:11:11,691
So much fun.

415
00:11:11,691 --> 00:11:12,800
These two guys in wine.

416
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:13,611
We had a great conversation.

417
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:14,120
They love me.

418
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,330
They love my fucking
anecdotes about [inaudible].

419
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,320
I told him the sideway story and,

420
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:18,950
uh,

421
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,671
never seen.

422
00:11:19,671 --> 00:11:21,600
Two guys have a better time and

423
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,030
they were pretty on the
end of the fucking bottle.

424
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,020
One of them had two drinks.

425
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,580
The other one had about fine,

426
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,890
maybe a total four ounces.

427
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,390
They were there.

428
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:32,661
They were,

429
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:33,870
they were really little glasses.

430
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,450
Spin glass of wine.

431
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:45,690
Yeah.
