1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello Freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,070
let me use another example because I
think this will help show what's happening

3
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:08,251
here.

4
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:09,084
So there was a,

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,540
uh,

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,500
a Chinese,

7
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,510
a site,

8
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:12,751
you know,

9
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:13,680
most drug trials,

10
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:18,060
they take place at different sites so
they have multiple locations that are

11
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:21,030
testing so that they can get
data on different populations,

12
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:21,190
you know,

13
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,100
not just in white Americans,

14
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,370
also Chinese people and you know,

15
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,930
so they do it different centers.

16
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:28,830
And so there was a,

17
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,680
it was a trial for an anticoagulant drug.

18
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,430
Um,

19
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,570
and uh,

20
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,820
they found that this Chinese center had
falsified a whole bunch of patient data

21
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:43,821
and change the results and if they took
that Chinese center's data out of the

22
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:44,581
equation,

23
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:45,810
that drug would have failed.

24
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,930
It wouldn't have been more
effective than placebo.

25
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,190
But even though the FDA
busted this group in China,

26
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,060
the study that was published on that
drug still included that data from the

27
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:04,020
study in China and even studies that were
being published 18 months later still

28
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:06,570
included that data in
the original data set.

29
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,940
So the FDA busted them.

30
00:01:08,941 --> 00:01:12,540
It was clear that they had falsified the
data and yet that data is still being

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,100
included in the studies that doctors are
relying on all over the world to make

32
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:19,740
decisions about whether
to prescribe these drugs.

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,420
So there's,

34
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,760
there's fraud happening and whether it's,

35
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:24,300
you know,

36
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,190
from financial interests or just human
error that's not actually being reported

37
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:32,090
and translating into
clinical decisions that,

38
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,510
that doctors are making.

39
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,310
So there are a lot of.

40
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,560
And then the whole peer review process,

41
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:39,930
you mentioned peer review to a,

42
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:43,110
there was a pretty big study where,

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,033
um,

44
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,300
the,

45
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:45,840
the,

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,020
uh,

47
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,730
paper was submitted to Bmj,

48
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:51,750
British Medical Journal and other big
medical journal with eight major errors

49
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,920
and not a single one of the 221 scientists
that were asked to review the paper,

50
00:01:55,921 --> 00:02:00,921
caught all of the errors and only 30
percent recommended rejecting the paper.

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,680
And this was even more problematic because
half of those scientists were warned

52
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,883
in advance.

53
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,530
We're going to give you a
paper that has a lot of errors.

54
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,530
And,

55
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:15,180
and the ones who were warned didn't
get any more of the errors than the

56
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:17,160
scientists that weren't warned in advance.

57
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:18,480
They broke them up into two groups.

58
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,150
Is that just a lack of time to do the
research and people being overwhelmed by a

59
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:23,970
workload?

60
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,710
I think that's probably part of it.

61
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,340
Um,

62
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,390
but it's not really an excuse.

63
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,260
I don't know.

64
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,630
I mean it's just,

65
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:32,470
it's a problem with peer
review because our artist,

66
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:32,880
you know,

67
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,060
it is a big part of the
scientific method to,

68
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,170
to have the results validated
by somebody else or,

69
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,310
or two to review the work
and make sure that it sounds.

70
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,700
But what this paper indicated is that a
lot of findings that we take to be true

71
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:49,800
and valid might not
actually be true and valid.

72
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,630
And you may have heard about this,

73
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:52,890
it actually made the news,

74
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,060
um,

75
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,080
there was a recent,

76
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,480
the open science collaboration did a
review of one psychology studies and that

77
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:02,920
had never been replicated.

78
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,690
Replicating findings is really important
in the scientific method to like if you

79
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:09,820
design a study and you do it and you have,

80
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,940
you find a certain result in science,

81
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:16,460
it's not really considered to
be valid unless I do it and,

82
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,860
and confirm your results,

83
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,190
you know,

84
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,240
or someone else does.

85
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,860
It's independent of you.

86
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,470
And in a shocking number of studies,

87
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:24,550
this never happens.

88
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,180
And so they,

89
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,200
this group went back and looked at 100
psychology studies and tried to replicate

90
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:30,034
them using the,

91
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,401
you know,

92
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:35,401
almost identical conditions
from the original studies
and they were only able to

93
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:38,740
do that in 35 percent of cases there.

94
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,310
Uh,

95
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,770
another group looked at a precancer,

96
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,270
a clinical studies and found that could
only replicate 11 percent of those.

97
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,680
It's a well known saying in
the pharmaceutical world that,

98
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,220
that,

99
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,950
like more than half of the drug
trials can't be replicated.

100
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:56,230
And have a group of
researchers from Bayer,

101
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:59,860
from a pharmaceutical company
tried to do that in 2011.

102
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,700
They took a bunch of trials and try to
replicate them less than one quarter.

103
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,560
Then they were able to
replicate the results.

104
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:07,510
So what this means is,

105
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,220
you know,

106
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,540
a study can be done,

107
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,130
it's never validated and then a whole
bunch of other studies are done that refer

108
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:20,131
to that study and whole
fields of scientific research
are spawn on a study that

109
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:23,410
was never confirmed or validated.

110
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,190
So it's like a house of cards
built on a foundation of falsehood.

111
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,300
Well,

112
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,440
so you know,

113
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,090
science is great.

114
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,010
We need to keep improving science,

115
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:36,730
but there's a lot of problems with the
way that studies are performed right now

116
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:37,380
and it Kinda,

117
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:37,680
it's,

118
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,350
it's both,

119
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:38,740
you know,

120
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,480
conflicts of interest that are based
on money and it's just also human human

121
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:43,751
error.

122
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:44,460
Are

123
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,640
these black mold spores just
being poisoned all the time.

124
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,860
Do they have home tests for that?

125
00:04:48,861 --> 00:04:49,770
I bet you anything.

126
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:50,970
I have so much black,

127
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,490
black people,

128
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,380
fucking son of a bitch.

129
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,313
He's

130
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,230
got to keep an eye on it.

131
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,550
Help the jokes.

132
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,151
They come,

133
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:03,984
they just come.

134
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,400
I hit a bunch of mold the other day.

135
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,920
It's late at night and
we bought strawberries.

136
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,710
You know like underneath the
strawberry was like green and stuff.

137
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,390
I had no idea because it was dark.

138
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:16,350
I was eating strawberries and the next
day I go in to get some more and I'm

139
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:16,501
like,

140
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:17,310
they're all moldy.

141
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:17,800
I'm like,

142
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,633
was I eating?

143
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,110
I was eating moldy strawberry in the dark.

144
00:05:22,111 --> 00:05:22,944
Yeah,

145
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,833
man.

146
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,650
It's probably not even that bad for you.

147
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,940
It's probably just all in your head.

148
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,050
I mean,

149
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,950
otherwise people would
be dying left and right,

150
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,360
right,

151
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,580
right.

152
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,300
Because everybody eats strawberries
and doesn't pay attention.

153
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,110
I didn't realize people actually
could pass up behind a dumpster late.

154
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,260
I've never been that drunk to where
that's where I would lay down.

155
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,660
I fucked by a dumpster
but never slept there.

156
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,360
He fucked by a dumpster,

157
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:46,340
like call that dumpster
grease on the ground now.

158
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,000
Slippery to boxes down,

159
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:49,320
but oh my God,

160
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:50,730
what a classy girl you must have been.

161
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,870
I told you about this and the guy came
out and he caught us having sex and he's

162
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:54,990
like,

163
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,470
oh,

164
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,011
you got nervous.

165
00:05:56,011 --> 00:05:56,410
He's like,

166
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,530
do you guys want some pizza?

167
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,010
Because he thought

168
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,843
we were homeless.

169
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,880
Homeless Bank to homeless people,

170
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:04,160
Bang on pizza boxes next to dumpsters.

171
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:05,060
That's pretty much it.

172
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,710
You heard this media narrative
that it sells papers.

173
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:10,851
It sell,

174
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:12,590
it didn't sell clicks at the
time because they were doing,

175
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:13,520
it's about the Internet,

176
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:14,510
but it sells papers,

177
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:18,860
which is the idea that the internet is
a haven of crooks and fraudsters and

178
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:20,710
terrorists and pedophiles and pornography.

179
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,643
Great.

180
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,210
Yes.

181
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,950
Criminal use of advanced technology,

182
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,641
criminal use,

183
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:29,360
the most advanced technology they can
get their hands on because they're in a

184
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:30,620
very highly competitive,

185
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:31,311
high margin,

186
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:33,200
high risk business.

187
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,600
And of course they're going to say they
criminals wear shoes to run away from

188
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,540
bank heist criminals drive cars to
get away from raw bank robberies.

189
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,550
They use cell phones to
coordinate with each other.

190
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,780
They drink water.

191
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:46,520
So it does not to die of dehydration.

192
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,800
We're not going to ban
all of those things.

193
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,903
Right?

194
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,420
And so you have that anger.

195
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,943
Um,

196
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,540
and they tried that for awhile.

197
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,943
Um,

198
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,210
every time they try that,

199
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,410
you just turn around and say,

200
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:00,711
Oh,

201
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,160
well,

202
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,490
you know,

203
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:06,490
actually the biggest money launderers
of drugs in the world are HSBC,

204
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:07,394
the Hong Kong,

205
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,001
Hong Kong,

206
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,560
Shanghai banking consortium.

207
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:15,440
Inconvenient fact is that
laundry is in the world.

208
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:15,771
Yes.

209
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:16,471
They would call it the model.

210
00:07:16,471 --> 00:07:17,121
New Laundering,

211
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:22,121
$700,000,000,000 for the Sinaloa cartel
over a period of 10 years during which

212
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:26,930
19,000 people died in Mexico
as a direct result of that.

213
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,873
Um,

214
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,580
and they got a fine and
no one went to jail.

215
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,370
So there are inconvenient facts like that.

216
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,920
Every time they say
bitcoin fund's terrorism,

217
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:37,270
you say,

218
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,103
ah,

219
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,820
I see them driving Toyota's and Humvees,

220
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,343
uh,

221
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,510
that doesn't,

222
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,810
that's a bit incongruence.

223
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,571
Like they're,

224
00:07:46,571 --> 00:07:48,950
they're driving around in the vehicles.

225
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:53,780
We left behind and there they got a lot
of their funding from pallets of money

226
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:58,781
that we left behind and they're getting
paid for dollar in dollars for oil that

227
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:02,210
they're selling to our closest allies.

228
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,280
We shouldn't really
mentioned Saudi Arabia.

229
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:05,360
Um,

230
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,110
so these are the inconvenient truth,

231
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:07,371
right?

232
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:11,720
So you don't talk about these in
polite company or at least you do.

233
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,310
Like,

234
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:16,940
that's what I said when I was invited to
speak in front of the Senate in Canada

235
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,420
and they started asking me about terrorism
and I said to actually mostly funded

236
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:21,231
by our allies.

237
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:22,520
And what did they say when you do that?

238
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,050
That was the end of that train of thought.

239
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,831
They stopped,

240
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,230
you know,

241
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,490
it was live public tv,

242
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,210
but what,

243
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:29,630
what,

244
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,200
like what went down when we moved
on to talk about more realistic and

245
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:36,170
interesting things in a much more
positive view of what this thing is.

246
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:40,700
So they tried to discredit bitcoin by
attaching it to terrorism and you informed

247
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:43,940
them of the facts of where
terrorists are actually funded from.

248
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:44,750
Yes.

249
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,580
In a very public forum on live TV,

250
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:49,910
which was very difficult to
continue that line of conversation.

251
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,390
So that's anger.

252
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,980
Is there a resistance in Canada?

253
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,260
Like there isn't the United States where.

254
00:08:56,261 --> 00:08:56,400
No,

255
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:56,920
actually,

256
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,500
um,

257
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:57,710
they,

258
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,531
they've been very,

259
00:08:58,531 --> 00:08:59,370
very positive,

260
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,660
very positive to,

261
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,523
towards,

262
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,530
towards cryptocurrencies in general.

263
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,330
Yeah.

264
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,090
Interesting.

265
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:06,760
And there's a lot of.
