1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,760
but that's how you fucking
create a middle class.

3
00:00:03,761 --> 00:00:06,060
She'd take the ship from the
top and move it to the metal.

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,910
So they just Bosch it at
everybody and you know,

5
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:09,311
they,

6
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:09,991
they use the,

7
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:10,331
the,

8
00:00:10,331 --> 00:00:11,520
the way they always use,

9
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:15,960
they use a lot of racism and they use an
absolute class as them to divide people

10
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:19,530
against each other and do their
fundraising shit or you know,

11
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:19,940
they,

12
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,170
and,

13
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,420
and all the laws that they changed since
Reagan were deregulation laws and it

14
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:25,350
was so that there were,

15
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:27,450
they deregulated the insurance company,

16
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:31,830
so like bosses can take peasant insurance
out on their employees and so if they

17
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:32,161
die,

18
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:33,150
they get a kickback.

19
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,830
Judges get a kickback,

20
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:35,490
you know,

21
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,360
they took public money and put it in
private pockets and they did it all in

22
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:43,470
through their lobbyists who
sit in Congress and have
nothing to do with serving

23
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:45,240
the needs of the people
who sent them there.

24
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,620
Now that is some bullshit that's fucking
hilarious or what it is sometimes.

25
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:51,750
Like you can't write comedy like that.

26
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,360
I don't think it's hilarious.

27
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,240
Disgusting.

28
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,520
But I agree with you that it's hilarious.

29
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:57,720
I'll fucking transparent it is.

30
00:00:57,721 --> 00:01:01,290
And I think that you breaking it down
like that is going to let people sort of

31
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,350
look at it from the ones that they got
everybody fired by boat Flag Bible Bible

32
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:09,744
flag.

33
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,443
Yeah,

34
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,600
you made me forget to
buy two Barato nicknames.

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,310
It's like just a fun catch
phrases of bullshit slogans.

36
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,151
It doesn't mean shit.

37
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:22,440
You're not going to get shit for it.

38
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:22,741
Right.

39
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:24,540
Your kid ain't going to get nowhere.

40
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:26,190
He's not gay school.

41
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,710
Well I have them and my family was like,

42
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:28,891
well,

43
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:29,820
we need to be able,

44
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,380
this was like it in Hawaii to where
this old lady gets up there made me so

45
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:34,951
fucking mad.

46
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:35,700
She goes,

47
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,880
I'm 82 years old and I'm a I A,

48
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,930
I may a GMO farmer and um,

49
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,640
you know,

50
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:43,831
uh,

51
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:46,830
I'm 82 and if I didn't have my GMO crops,

52
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:48,770
I won't be able to send my grandchildren,

53
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,030
my children to college
and they get up there.

54
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,893
Their testimony.

55
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,970
I want to go to college.

56
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,053
But you know,

57
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,060
I go up there and go,

58
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,730
I don't care how old you are.

59
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,720
You don't have the right to
give my grandkids asthma.

60
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,273
Hello.

61
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,550
But they don't,

62
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,460
they don't connect to anything cause
there are fucking on dope for one thing

63
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,580
there on all that fucking
they're depressed as fuck.

64
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,590
America takes two thirds of the world's
antidepressants and then they got to

65
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,630
antidepressant booster
on top of every year.

66
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:25,680
If it doesn't make you forget reality
quick enough and you know they're just

67
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,780
drowning in bullshit,

68
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,520
but they,

69
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:28,960
they,

70
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,970
they want bullshit more than
they want anything else.

71
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:37,650
It's like a fucking incredible
addiction or give us our bullshit.

72
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,020
Give us our fucking bullshit.

73
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:41,670
But it's all fucking bullshit.

74
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,470
It's all fucking bullshit.

75
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,140
Truth is scary because it's simple and
they can't stand simple cause they don't

76
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:50,460
feel smart and less.

77
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,070
It's all convoluted
labyrinths of bullshit.

78
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:53,890
The,

79
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,180
the,

80
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:54,380
the,

81
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,740
the simple truth is fucking overwhelming
to them because they're fucking liars.

82
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,500
So like,

83
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,861
hi,

84
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:02,590
how am I going to stand here and have
something true come out of my mouth?

85
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,390
How am I going to do that?

86
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,310
I won't be getting paid for that.

87
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,590
But I mean the people themselves
that are addicted to the bullshit,

88
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,251
like what,

89
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:09,700
what is,

90
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,590
what does what street?

91
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,030
And that's why I say I don't use it.

92
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:13,660
They,

93
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,390
they have convoluted
hope until beam all you.

94
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,280
There's hope that you're gonna make it.

95
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:18,821
There's hope.

96
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:20,080
You're going to climb out of that hole.

97
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:20,831
There's hope,

98
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:21,670
there's a payoff.

99
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:22,151
There's hope.

100
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:23,530
You're going to win in the casino.

101
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,330
There isn't any fucking help.

102
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,740
All there is is Jess,

103
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,251
you know,

104
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:30,670
United and with other people helping each
other to get rid of fucking criminals

105
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:31,750
that are robbing us.

106
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,000
Well that's certainly the best hope.

107
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,003
That's right.

108
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,320
So I hope that people will
fucking wake the fuck up.

109
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,280
That's where I hope,

110
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,413
I think they are.

111
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,290
I think,

112
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,070
I think they are.

113
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,903
I think that helped.

114
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,170
That'll become an internet meme.

115
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,220
What you just said,

116
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,840
someone will take that turn into a clip.

117
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:49,960
It'll be a video and people say
Roseanne Barr break shit down.

118
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,560
That's just going to say I like
doing it for people cause you know,

119
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:53,890
they,

120
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,461
you know,

121
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:56,400
cause I can and I like good.

122
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:56,881
Just go and,

123
00:03:56,881 --> 00:03:57,071
Hey,

124
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,800
I'll read all the ship for you and
I'll tell you what it means to,

125
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,971
cause I feel like,

126
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:01,270
Hey,

127
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,691
you know,

128
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:02,524
uh,

129
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:02,860
uh,

130
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,660
that's a service I can provide.

131
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,880
Maybe I'm full of Shit on some topics.

132
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:09,820
Look it up for yourself and then
come back and tell me if I am or not.

133
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,893
I'll listen.

134
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,411
But I mean,

135
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:12,250
somebody's got to put it,

136
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:15,730
this whole complete system
of obsolete bullshit.

137
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,000
They got a late start laughing at
the scorn and fucking replace it with

138
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:20,710
something that fucking makes sense.

139
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,823
Okay.

140
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:30,780
Okay.
