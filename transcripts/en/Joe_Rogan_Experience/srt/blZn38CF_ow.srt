1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,360
Start Broadcast Shazamm bitches.
I think it's on where we live.

2
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,300
Yeah.
Excellent type fuckers.

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,190
We're getting a little better.
Three.

4
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:27,170
Oh seven.
Now that's a little bit better right?

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,190
There we go.

6
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:32,600
Zoom.
Zoom.

7
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,520
What's happening?
Five years?

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,250
Everybody can hear us.
So good.

9
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,320
Let's leave it sideways.
I believe it would a gangsta lean.

10
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:46,910
Uh,
hello everybody.

11
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,370
Welcome to the.
What is it?

12
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:52,310
The fucking ninth weekly one or 
something company.

13
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,540
We have continued.
Motherfucking saga continues.

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,090
Let's jump.
This is how you drink coffee.

15
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:01,100
Okay.
Like a fucking man.

16
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,710
See that's your right there.
That's what's called a French Press.

17
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,320
You can get it at tarbox.
Starbucks.

18
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,820
Starbucks for like 20 bucks or something
or you know,

19
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:15,210
I target for 20 bucks.
That's what I was in the middle saying 

20
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,450
target and starbucks at the same time.
You just grind up your coffee.

21
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,940
The report in this motherfucker,
you pour the hot water,

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,920
you push down the plunger,
but Bam.

23
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,390
You Got Coffee?
Yeah.

24
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,810
It's gritty and it's got like little 
pieces of stuff in it.

25
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:31,811
But.
So what you fucking pussy man up man up 

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,820
man up and drink your coffee.

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,040
How is Australia?
Australia?

28
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,890
Is the shits if you've never been to 
Australia?

29
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,430
It's fucking spectacular.
It's beautiful.

30
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,050
The people are cool as fuck.
It's really bizarre man.

31
00:01:48,051 --> 00:01:50,150
It's way the fuck on the other side of 
the world,

32
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:55,151
like literally on the other side of the 
world to where it's a 19 hour time 

33
00:01:55,151 --> 00:01:58,550
difference between Los Angeles in 
Australia.

34
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,830
What's.
What's the laws like out there?

35
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,070
Is there any.
The weed is not very legal there.

36
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,810
Yeah,
but it's everywhere.

37
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,210
Everybody's got wheat.
Yeah.

38
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:13,540
So because I got a text from mayhem 
right before we left because my mom got 

39
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:16,670
there before us and he said,
Yo,

40
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,780
this is the exact test.
The exact text yo costumes.

41
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:24,530
Here is a motherfucker.
Don't bring any weed to kangaroo island.

42
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,750
Which have you known mayhem.
That's a,

43
00:02:28,751 --> 00:02:33,751
that's a hand quote right there.
I'm so ladies and gentlemen,

44
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,110
a fucking trainer yesterday got killed 
by an work off.

45
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:43,140
Do you hear about that shit?
You didn't hear about that killer whale 

46
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,030
killed a trainer at seaworld.
Wow.

47
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,120
And what's amazing to me is how they 
haven't been killing people up to this 

48
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:52,280
point.
Could you imagine if whales,

49
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:57,281
killer whales,
and it's supposed to be super 

50
00:02:57,281 --> 00:02:57,281
intelligent.
I mean,

51
00:02:57,281 --> 00:03:00,001
they're like as intelligent as humans,
they're cousins of dolphins and we put 

52
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:03,730
them in a fucking fish tank and make 
them do tricks for mackerels,

53
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,940
you know,
can you imagine what kind of hell that 

54
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,621
life is?
This a whale had killed a homeless man 

55
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:15,630
that snuck into the fucking tank in 1991
and he had also a,

56
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,480
or it might be a sheet,
I'm not sure he or she had also,

57
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:21,380
I think it's also,
uh,

58
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,530
almost drowned a trainer.

59
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,580
What do you remember that video where 
the killer whale was playing with the 

60
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,330
person dunking him under that same same 
whale?

61
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,350
Wow.
Same Way.

62
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,670
Yeah.
So,

63
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,700
I mean,
it's not like the warning fucking signs 

64
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:38,700
weren't there.
It's like,

65
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:38,700
you know,
you,

66
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,630
you know,
you hear Mike Tyson's punch somebody.

67
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,270
You couldn't be shocked.
Like,

68
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,600
how'd he die?
He,

69
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,280
oh,
it's a woman that died.

70
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,060
He,
uh,

71
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,480
he grabbed her by the waist and just 
fucking ripped her up in the middle of a

72
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:52,110
live show at the beginning of the live 
videos and said,

73
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,370
well,
that's a good question.

74
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,390
I bet they confiscated everybody's 
cameras and shit as they were leaving 

75
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,820
the SD cards or system or you think you 
would learn to shove it up your ass or 

76
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,320
something like this guy.
If he was there for sure there will be a

77
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:07,390
video of it.
1,000

78
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:12,391
percent.
We need everybody's camera's SD card up 

79
00:04:12,391 --> 00:04:14,590
as save two.

80
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,880
You would have vetted,
uploaded to youtube already.

81
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,210
I'd already been Bluetooth.
Can use stream.

82
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,190
Yeah.
There's no fucking way.

83
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:26,191
I mean,
could you imagine what that must've 

84
00:04:26,191 --> 00:04:26,270
looked like?
You're,

85
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,030
you're there and all of a sudden the 
killer,

86
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,350
he grabbed her about the waste and just 
started smashing her back and forth.

87
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:35,230
Just ragdoll here.
He just had enough.

88
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,420
He just said,
that's it.

89
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,790
That's it motherfuckers,
you know,

90
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,090
it's really incredible that we think 
it's cool to do that.

91
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,280
And then we go and watch them.
You know,

92
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,040
it's really like,
zoos bums me the fuck out.

93
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,330
We went to a zoo in um,
Australia while we were there and there 

94
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:57,991
was a cool part of it was the crocodile 
cage because I don't think that 

95
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:01,420
crocodile gives a fuck where it is.
I think crocodiles are so dumb.

96
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,600
I mean they seem third mind seemed so 
dead.

97
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,780
They just lay there with their eyes 
closed underwater for like hours at a 

98
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,530
time where they don't have to breathe 
and I can brief for like an hour.

99
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,150
So they just lay underwater and just do 
nothing and just sit there.

100
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,350
They don't run around and play like when
you pass like the monkey cage at a zoo,

101
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,230
that shit's depressing because they 
don't want to be there.

102
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:26,330
When I was in Denver,
there's a zoo in Denver and uh,

103
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:31,410
the monkey gun in his fucking cage and 
was howling this horrible howl and it 

104
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:36,901
wasn't a big cage.
This monkey was screaming out like a 

105
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:38,110
tortured soul.
It was like a man in prison,

106
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,370
you know,
let me out of the monkey was just 

107
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,220
screaming at the top of his lungs.
And I was like,

108
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,550
this is not good.
Like this is not cool to do them for 

109
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,620
what?
So people can stare at them.

110
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,250
I mean that shit.
She might've flown in the 19 thirties,

111
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:56,980
you know,
back when there was no zoos are back,

112
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,430
there's no videos,
but we have videos now,

113
00:05:59,431 --> 00:06:00,890
man.
You don't have to put them in a zoo,

114
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,480
you know?
But,

115
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,030
but that's the only time we would ever 
be able to see most of those animals.

116
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,740
That's the only thing that makes me go 
well,

117
00:06:07,741 --> 00:06:12,741
I see the reason for zoom because I'm 
not going to Africa and hunting down a 

118
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:12,741
white tiger,
you know?

119
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,430
Right.

120
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Worth it for them to struggle.
Just so you could stare at them.

121
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,970
Yeah.
But you know,

122
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,300
it could also be like,
dude,

123
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:21,650
wait,
I don't have to hunt my food.

124
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:23,960
There's just a stake here.
Every morning when I wake up,

125
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,860
I could sleep.

126
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,590
No,
no,

127
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,420
no.
For like tigers.

128
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,510
That shit is orgasmic to chase down an 
animal,

129
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,570
chase it and move it.
You ever see a cap?

130
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,520
Like if you roll a ball,
a string in front of them,

131
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,780
they can't help themselves.
Man,

132
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:39,990
you should know that you have cats.
Cats can't help it.

133
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,620
They live for chasing shit,
so it's just like,

134
00:06:43,621 --> 00:06:48,621
like you know,
a guy with a hard dick lives to fuck 

135
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:48,621
right now.
It's really the same thing,

136
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:50,970
man.
There it's nature rewards them for being

137
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:53,250
a good Predator and I think,
you know,

138
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:57,030
the same way food tastes good for us and
sex feels good for us.

139
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:02,270
They love to kill that nature that 
rewards them with some crazy rush of 

140
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,130
energy and an endorphins when they kill 
something,

141
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,480
you know?
So you give them a cold plate of meat 

142
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,040
just pushing aluminum tray under the 
fucking cage.

143
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,530
That's not the same.
And that's not fun.

144
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,960
Guaranteed,
you know,

145
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:20,370
but that doesn't that the killing thing 
bothers me.

146
00:07:20,371 --> 00:07:24,420
But what really bothers me is the 
fucking amount of room that they have to

147
00:07:24,421 --> 00:07:29,421
move around the kangaroo.
The kangaroo cage was fucked up.

148
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,820
Have you ever read the San Diego Zoo 
though?

149
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:33,740
That's a whole.
I mean,

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,010
that's what I was there.
I was like,

151
00:07:35,011 --> 00:07:40,011
man,
I would like to be an animal in this 

152
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:40,011
case.

153
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:42,390
Oh No.
We went down this serious fucking 

154
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,500
deliver between what we're saying.
What we're saying was that it.

155
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,800
We got it.
Okay.

156
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,250
Um,
yeah,

157
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:50,590
San Diego is the shit.
The way they have it as nice.

158
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,320
They have a big giant ass place that,
that makes sense.

159
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:56,460
But that's fucking expensive,
you know.

160
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:01,630
But that's how it should be.
They places like the La Zoo just 

161
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:01,640
shouldn't exist because that's just 
wrong.

162
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:04,040
You go to the Lsu,
that's just depressing as fuck,

163
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,380
but there is just like the Columbus 
state where I'm from.

164
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,230
It's one of the biggest news Jack 
Hanna's from it and it's nice.

165
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:12,650
They may have just acres and acres and 
acres of land and they,

166
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,360
you know,
I don't know if they maybe throw out 

167
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:18,360
some goats once in a while for the 
Tigers or something.

168
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,540
It just don't talk about it.
And you know,

169
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,370
they don't do that.
Don't ever do that.

170
00:08:21,371 --> 00:08:23,530
They do that in Iraq.
There's video in Iraq,

171
00:08:23,531 --> 00:08:27,580
have a little donkey loose and this is 
how they do it every day.

172
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,820
And the dog,
because just walking around eating and 

173
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,741
they open up the gate and these tigers 
come running out of the gate and just 

174
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:35,470
pick,
slept at docie to the ground and fucking

175
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:35,970
Jack.
Um,

176
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,130
it's really kind of wild to see.
And it's really shocking.

177
00:08:39,131 --> 00:08:42,220
These gis filmed it when they were in 
Iraq at the zoo.

178
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,600
It's,
it's shocking to see.

179
00:08:43,601 --> 00:08:46,090
But that's really the way they're 
supposed to eat.

180
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,010
Like though,
that's how you should do it.

181
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,000
If you're going to feed animals,
you're going to have wild animals.

182
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,050
You should have them eat what they 
normally eat,

183
00:08:53,051 --> 00:08:53,980
man.
I mean like,

184
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,300
what's with this feeding fucking snakes.
Frozen mice.

185
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:59,300
Give them a fucking mouse,
you know?

186
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,720
I mean,
that's what they're supposed to do.

187
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:02,220
We're,
we're trying to like,

188
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,860
enforce our own ideas of,
of,

189
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:08,040
of morality and predation on fucking 
monsters.

190
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,960
You know what I mean?
Like,

191
00:09:08,961 --> 00:09:11,640
like a snake is a monster dude.
You know,

192
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,710
tigers.
That's a monster.

193
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,230
Those are all monsters.
Their,

194
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,680
their,
their national monsters.

195
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,870
They,
there's a whole natural cycle of things.

196
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:21,690
And to take them out of that,
there's a,

197
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:26,691
there was a kangaroo cage that was the 
most depressing thing because those 

198
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:26,970
kangaroos are just sitting there.
They didn't

199
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,000
shit.
There's human beings.

200
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,940
There could be considered monster.
So like if you're,

201
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,410
if you put somebody in prison that's a 
mass murder,

202
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:35,730
we're doing the same thing.
You know,

203
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:37,890
we're,
we should let that mass murder go out on

204
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:39,630
his way and just murder a shitload of 
people,

205
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,510
you know,
dumb ass logic as well.

206
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:44,340
I mean,
if you're saying like,

207
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,410
you know,
like a tiger that tiger or whatever,

208
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,260
like a snake should kill its own prey 
and we should,

209
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:49,980
you know,
do what,

210
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,890
what,
what?

211
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,230
No,
we're feeding them killed.

212
00:09:53,231 --> 00:09:54,640
Pray.
We kill it first.

213
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,020
That's what's the most ridiculous thing 
is that we kill what they,

214
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,880
they eat first so that it's not as 
brutal for us.

215
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,650
Somehow or another,
someone else kills it.

216
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:03,430
You buy it,
killed,

217
00:10:03,431 --> 00:10:04,810
then you feed it to them.
That's ridiculous.

218
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:06,540
Yeah.
That's not a mass murderer,

219
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:11,550
dude.
Mass murderers or just fucked in the 

220
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:11,550
head.
They're not.

221
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:11,860
They're not killing for food is a part 
of a natural cycle.

222
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,810
They're just nuts,
you know.

223
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,320
Then when you get a naughty person,
the problem is human consciousness is so

224
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:22,321
more complex supposedly than animal 
consciousness because we have the 

225
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,711
ability to alter our environment so you 
can't have someone whose consciousness 

226
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:30,240
is haywire because that's.
That's what when you have like serial 

227
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,320
killers or mass murderers will you have 
someone whose consciousness is just gone

228
00:10:32,321 --> 00:10:37,321
off the tracks and into the woods and 
you have just chaos and if a society is 

229
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:43,381
aware of itself,
it has to realize that there's certain 

230
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:44,080
issues are going to come up when you 
have crazy people running around killing

231
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:46,570
your family and your friends,
so you got to kill them.

232
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,180
What you're supposed to do with someone 
like a mass murder of.

233
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,550
You're absolutely convinced.
That's the problem.

234
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:53,170
Really.
The problem is the court system,

235
00:10:53,171 --> 00:10:56,710
the court system,
so fucking corrupt and so many times das

236
00:10:56,711 --> 00:10:58,980
and prosecutors are just trying to get 
a.

237
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:04,110
they're just kind of trying to get a 
guilty verdict and they don't give a 

238
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:04,510
fuck if someone is guilty or not.
There's many,

239
00:11:04,511 --> 00:11:09,511
many,
many instances where cops have framed 

240
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:09,880
guys that were innocent.
People have gone to jail for years.

241
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:12,040
It turns out the DNA evidence,
they were framed.

242
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,390
I mean that's happened many,
many,

243
00:11:13,391 --> 00:11:14,890
many.
That's the real fucking problem.

244
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,980
But if we could be absolutely sure that 
we knew that somebody was a mass 

245
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,790
murderer or a rapist or anyone with no 
remorse,

246
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,580
who hurt other people and could hurt 
someone that you care,

247
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,010
you've got to kill him.
Why?

248
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:28,030
Why keep them around?
There's too many fucking people,

249
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,100
you know.
I mean,

250
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:34,101
look,
it's not like they're not going to die 

251
00:11:34,101 --> 00:11:34,101
eventually anyway.
It's not like if you don't tell them,

252
00:11:34,101 --> 00:11:34,840
you know,
they're gonna fucking to cure cancer and

253
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:35,770
live forever.
No,

254
00:11:35,771 --> 00:11:38,680
they're not going to do anything.
They're not a mass murderer is not going

255
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:40,060
to contribute to society.
You know,

256
00:11:40,061 --> 00:11:40,900
they're,
they're just not.

257
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:46,090
There's nothing is going to.
Nothing good is going to come out of 

258
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:46,090
that.

259
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:46,250
It should just line them up and like,
oh,

260
00:11:46,251 --> 00:11:47,660
you need a new liver?
Bam.

261
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,960
You're on death row,
row.

262
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,120
There should be no,
like,

263
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,370
you know,
time period and they're going to 

264
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:55,370
electrocute you.
They should just shoot.

265
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,921
You.
Take all the parts that they could use 

266
00:11:58,921 --> 00:11:58,921
your corneas,
are your livers best?

267
00:11:58,921 --> 00:12:03,400
An interesting topic because there was a
threat on the board and the message 

268
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,851
board on my website where people were 
talking about Oregon's having a memory 

269
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,520
and uh,
there are all these people who have 

270
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,700
gotten transplants when people,
all of a sudden they knew things that 

271
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,780
couldn't have possibly known as people 
who don't even know,

272
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:17,840
but you know,
it's like that.

273
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,510
Yeah.
I mean,

274
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,520
I've,
I've heard of many things like that 

275
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,211
where people sudden had cravings for 
certain types of foods and they had no 

276
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:25,211
idea that the.
I mean,

277
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,160
this is not just one instance.
And see the thing is about memory.

278
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:29,870
Like we don't know where memory is 
stored.

279
00:12:29,871 --> 00:12:31,160
Exactly.
We don't.

280
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,910
I mean,
they know an incredible amount more than

281
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:39,911
the average person about the way the 
human body works much more than people 

282
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:41,680
knew 100 years ago,
much more than you know,

283
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,750
even a decade ago,
but they don't know everything.

284
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,340
There's a lot of questions,
Matt.

285
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,350
First of all,
when human body,

286
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,930
your cells regenerate every seven to 10 
years.

287
00:12:50,931 --> 00:12:55,931
I think it's seven years,
so literally every cell in your body 

288
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:57,960
changes and becomes a new one like you 
are.

289
00:12:57,961 --> 00:13:00,930
You're a new version of you every seven 
to 10 years.

290
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,350
Yes.
There's not the same anymore.

291
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,990
So if that's the case,
where the fuck are your memories?

292
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,870
Because I have memories that are way 
more than seven years old,

293
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,370
you know,
so where the memory is stored,

294
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:15,260
if you have a completely new cell,
I mean are the memories like transferred

295
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,990
back and forth between the cells when 
the new one is born?

296
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,210
Is it born with the same memories?
I mean,

297
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:21,320
what?
Where's the memory?

298
00:13:21,321 --> 00:13:23,180
Where's it stored?
We don't fucking know.

299
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,360
The other idea is that the memories are 
stored in the neurons.

300
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,470
Well,
if that's the case,

301
00:13:27,471 --> 00:13:30,530
because the neurons are the only thing 
that stay the neurons or not.

302
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,890
You get the neurons you get or the 
neurons you get forever.

303
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,180
You don't get new ones.
You know,

304
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,810
they don't regenerate every seven years,
but the heart is filled with neurons.

305
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,230
You know?
It's like one of the biggest clusters of

306
00:13:42,231 --> 00:13:44,210
neurons in the body.
It's like right up there with the brain.

307
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,540
And I think people who have had heart 
transplants,

308
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,390
I don't think it's that preposterous 
that they would have memories.

309
00:13:50,391 --> 00:13:52,310
I don't think that that's.
Is that preposterous at all?

310
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:57,830
I think it is.
And I think that that these people that 

311
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,591
say that they're having dreams stuff,
they probably would have had that same 

312
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:00,591
exact dream with or without it.

313
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:00,850
Why would you say that,
Brian?

314
00:14:00,851 --> 00:14:05,851
They're talking about things that 
couldn't possibly have known about 

315
00:14:05,851 --> 00:14:08,130
people have this little girl gave up the
exact identity and location of the 

316
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:13,510
woman.
Who of the man who murdered the girl who

317
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:15,940
gave her the heart.
Do you know that story?

318
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,640
No,
but it started there.

319
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,630
It sounds far fetched,
but it doesn't mean it's not good.

320
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,950
There's some things that I read that 
when it like that,

321
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:25,270
that it's kind of like to me is seeing 
you for.

322
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,500
It's either somebody that wants 
attention,

323
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,080
that's just dumb and they're going,
no,

324
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:34,110
I had my arm transplant and now I can.
I'm thinking having all these dreams are

325
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:35,070
people.
I don't know.

326
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,400
It's okay.
That's possible.

327
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:37,900
I know,
I know.

328
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,170
It's also possible that toilet,
it's real.

329
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,250
That's the problem with skepticism.
What skepticism.

330
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:43,370
This isn't

331
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,930
my comes to something that we don't 
understand.

332
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:49,931
That's the problems that you know,
you run the possibility of a excluding 

333
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:54,911
something because it seems,
but the reality is we don't have enough 

334
00:14:54,911 --> 00:14:56,570
information to decide what's rational,
what's irrational.

335
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,250
Just the idea that you have memories at 
all.

336
00:14:58,251 --> 00:14:59,930
It's fucking nuts.
You know the,

337
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:04,950
the idea that you can.
How about the idea that you can change 

338
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:04,950
people's memories?
You know,

339
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,890
they say that especially like right 
after something shocking.

340
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,020
If you start talking to someone and 
introducing new ideas to them,

341
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:12,800
they'll,
they'll have,

342
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,940
they'll remember the whole situation.
They'll change the whole way.

343
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:21,941
They remember things like,
have you ever thought of something was 

344
00:15:21,941 --> 00:15:25,211
in some way,
and then you go back and you watch the 

345
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:25,211
video,
you're like,

346
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:25,211
God damn.
It wasn't like that at all.

347
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:27,170
Like I had a fucking.
I don't trust my memory that much.

348
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,200
I trust some things.
There's some things that I know are 

349
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,190
recording in there forever for real and 
no doubt about it.

350
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,670
There's some things because I've made 
sure that have kept that memory.

351
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,850
Like I've had some pretty intense 
experiences where I made sure like I am 

352
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,730
going to make sure that I record this 
one,

353
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,030
but other ones are like fucking blur 
man.

354
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:49,270
You know,
there's a lot of them that are blurring,

355
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,900
you know,
you look back on your,

356
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,300
your high school years like Jesus 
Christ,

357
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,500
it's like a slideshows and I barely 
remember any of it.

358
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,480
Do you remember?
Like it's getting worse and worse.

359
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:04,481
I,
I'm actually pretty good with a lot of 

360
00:16:04,481 --> 00:16:04,481
weird memories.
But then I,

361
00:16:04,481 --> 00:16:08,500
the other day I was trying to think of 
somebody and that I actually hung out 

362
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,790
with for three years when I was a kid 
and don't remember his face at all.

363
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,410
Came up with like,
my sister's like,

364
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,360
you don't remember him?
We out all the time.

365
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,870
Like I remember him but I don't know.
Have any idea what he looks like.

366
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:22,950
Yeah,
I've had that happen to me before for 

367
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:22,950
sure.
That's fucking weird.

368
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,060
It is weird.
It's so weird.

369
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,550
I wonder where,
where all that shit goes.

370
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:30,870
Bin Smoke.
Why is it that someone can pull it back 

371
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:30,870
though?
Like someone will say something that you

372
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,610
go,
yes,

373
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,140
and then all of a sudden,
boom.

374
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:36,110
The memory like blossoms in your mind.
Like what is that?

375
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:38,570
It's like you're given CPR to the 
memories.

376
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:39,830
It's like they're almost dead.

377
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:45,490
Yeah.
It's like a branch of the tree was hit 

378
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,730
and nerve of that memory was hit and it 
woke up that,

379
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,320
that section of memory or whatever.
Yeah.

380
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,460
Something along those lines with.
What is that?

381
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,380
What the fuck is that?
Somebody's phone.

382
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,340
What happened?
Oh Dude,

383
00:16:59,341 --> 00:17:00,930
you had a spider on your face.
Look.

384
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,160
Oh Shit.
That's a daddy long legs.

385
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:10,350
How the fuck did that get on your house?
Fear factor.

386
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,770
Oh,
I'm not on.

387
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,480
I'm not on Opie and Anthony this week.
It's not this week.

388
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:23,270
They made a mistake.
I'm there March 26th,

389
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,590
not February 26 is the Friday,
Friday before the UFC.

390
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:30,380
Next Month in Dallas.
This weekend.

391
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:35,381
I'm not in New York this weekend,
so I'm going to be at the Addison 

392
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,090
Improv,
uh,

393
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,600
this weekend,
Friday,

394
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,600
Saturday,
and Sunday with my man Joey Diaz and 

395
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,730
Brian will be there as well if we get 
Brian drunk who might have to talk them 

396
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:47,730
into going on stage

397
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,090
chat.
Brian

398
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,040
is actually funny comedian.
He's done standup a couple of times.

399
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,260
He did it in,
uh,

400
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,590
Atlanta.
He did it.

401
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:57,390
Um,
what else would you do it,

402
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:03,340
you know,
I was going to try to go up on stage 

403
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,951
before this weekend just in case if,
if I get too drunk and he put me on 

404
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:05,951
stage,
but I really,

405
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:10,691
it really hurts me to go back and spend 
three hours of my life for like five 

406
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:12,650
minutes in front of two people.

407
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,660
The open mic nights,
it is a grind,

408
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:21,661
you know,
people ask me questions all the time 

409
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:21,661
like,
Hey,

410
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:21,661
I'm thinking about doing comedy.
What's the best advice?

411
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:21,661
I'm like,
man,

412
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:23,680
you gotta be willing to put your whole 
life aside.

413
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,560
You've got to be willing to do.
You got to be willing to.

414
00:18:26,561 --> 00:18:28,480
Especially if you have a job during the 
day,

415
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,860
you have a job on the day,
man,

416
00:18:29,861 --> 00:18:31,690
your nighttime,
you now,

417
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,210
that's your social life.
It's going to be standup comedy,

418
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,240
you're going to be going to clubs and 
you're going to be performing and you 

419
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,730
have to do it all the time.
If you don't do it all the time,

420
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,650
you're going to forget all your 
material.

421
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,000
The whatever comfort you gain on stage 
will be eroded very quickly.

422
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,090
You know,
it's a God damn long ask Ryan,

423
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,480
man.

424
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:54,770
Yeah.
I think if I was younger I would tell 

425
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,401
libby and do it,
but it's really hard to be an adult and 

426
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:56,401
waste that much time.

427
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:56,401
It is,
it is hard.

428
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,020
You know,
I did it.

429
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:02,080
I started doing standup when I was a 21.
That's how I did it right after my 21st 

430
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:06,320
birthday and I was,
I had shit going on back then,

431
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:06,860
man.
You know,

432
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:08,540
I mean,
I was doing things.

433
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:09,510
I have,
you know,

434
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:14,590
I had a life sort of,
but it wasn't like I had a family or a 

435
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:17,240
mortgage or a,
you know,

436
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,920
uh,
no obligations,

437
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,740
no Internet,
no obligations.

438
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,760
You know,
so it wasn't,

439
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:28,210
it's hard when you have a girlfriend and
you have a life and you have a life and 

440
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,980
you have children and a mortgage.
Fuck man.

441
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:36,220
You know,
when I talked to dudes that are like 40 

442
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:36,220
and they're thinking about doing comedy,
I'm like,

443
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:36,220
you know,
okay,

444
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,840
that's like saying I'm thinking about 
getting into brain surgery.

445
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:43,890
When we think about brand surgery,
not saying that comedy is as hard as 

446
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,990
brain surgery because it's first of all,
it's not as.

447
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:50,850
It's not as difficult to remember all 
the things you need to remember with 

448
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,300
brain surgeries,
but it's,

449
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,640
it is just as difficult in a way because
there was no real path.

450
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:58,910
I mean you could suck as a comedian.
You can't suck as a brain surgeon.

451
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:04,180
You're fucking going to jail.
So it's obviously a lot more discipline 

452
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,940
involved in brain surgery because you 
have to do it correctly,

453
00:20:04,941 --> 00:20:09,941
but both are equally difficult to 
actually fucking do and put anything in 

454
00:20:11,271 --> 00:20:14,630
this life is difficult if you're,
if you're gonna really do it.

455
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,780
I mean,
just think about if you started tomorrow

456
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:19,460
and you wanted to be a computer 
programmer,

457
00:20:19,461 --> 00:20:22,000
you don't know shit about computers,
you just,

458
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,890
you're starting from scratch and you 
want to be a computer programmer.

459
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,610
Fuck.
Imagine the fucking work that's involved

460
00:20:28,611 --> 00:20:29,000
in that.

461
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,090
A lot of reading now,
you know,

462
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:35,100
it's a lot of reading nowadays.
Like I mean you can pretty much teach 

463
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,110
myself some programming by just looking 
at it.

464
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,060
You know,
how to type,

465
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,640
you know about computers,
you know,

466
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:42,140
a lot of shit about computers,
you know,

467
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:44,060
a lot of shit about,
about code,

468
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:44,910
you know,
to it,

469
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,390
to a person that has no experience and 
decides I want to take on a new career.

470
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:52,660
I want to be a computer programmer.
I want to see code for video games.

471
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:57,930
Good fucking luck man.
How about I want to create video game 

472
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:58,060
engines.
I just,

473
00:20:58,061 --> 00:21:00,220
I don't know where I want to be the next
John Carmack.

474
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:02,650
You're fucked man.
You're fucked.

475
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:08,040
That shit will take forever.
Anything that's worth doing takes 

476
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,230
fucking forever to get good at.
You know,

477
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,440
and comedy is no different.
Comedy.

478
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,910
Music is no different.
You know,

479
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:17,010
I often look at people playing piano or 
playing guitar or something like that.

480
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:22,020
I go,
how cool would that be to be able to 

481
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,020
just fucking jam on the cash.
But God damn,

482
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,630
that's a lot of fucking time.

483
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,870
I've tried to learn that though.
If it's,

484
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,220
it's a,
it's a coordination thing for me though,

485
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:28,690
for that.
That's something.

486
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,790
Think you're just born with being able 
to understand,

487
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,050
be able to coordinate each finger a 
certain way.

488
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:38,590
Well it's also cultivation.
It's also if you do things like with 

489
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,940
your fingers like that early on in life,
you know,

490
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,600
it becomes much easier as you get older.
They say that um,

491
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,840
the army now is using,
um,

492
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:51,370
they're using xbox controllers for their
drones because he's fucking kids are so 

493
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,400
used to it.
Yeah.

494
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,440
And they're encouraging people to play 
video games.

495
00:21:54,441 --> 00:21:57,560
I mean it's just a matter of time before
they start record a recruiting,

496
00:21:57,561 --> 00:22:01,520
like the baddest motherfuckers in video 
games like the priority do.

497
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,860
I mean like if you could play like war 
games with like a keyboard and a mouse.

498
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,170
Like there's these dudes that play 
quake,

499
00:22:09,171 --> 00:22:14,171
like professionally,
those motherfuckers can move that mouse 

500
00:22:14,171 --> 00:22:16,430
cursor and put it on an object like 
instantaneously.

501
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:21,790
You know,
they know exactly where that cursor's 

502
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,740
going.
They play so much that when they move 

503
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,381
that mouse,
the mouse and the keyboard is way more 

504
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:26,381
accurate than that.

505
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:29,910
A joystick thing.
The Georgia thing is kind of difficult 

506
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,400
to manipulate the like the toggles and 
exactly where the cross.

507
00:22:31,401 --> 00:22:36,401
Here it goes.
But if you have a mouse you can put a 

508
00:22:36,401 --> 00:22:36,640
mouse if you understand like how quick 
you know.

509
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,720
It all depends on,
you know,

510
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,510
everybody likes a different.
Some people like high sensitivity,

511
00:22:41,511 --> 00:22:45,380
some people like low sensitivity,
but the bottom line is once you get used

512
00:22:45,381 --> 00:22:47,300
to whatever it is,
you move the mouse,

513
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:53,070
the cursor goes in a certain directions.
They can put it like exactly where they 

514
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:57,011
want to instantly.
So it's not like in you're in a 

515
00:22:57,011 --> 00:22:57,011
helicopter,
you see the insurgents,

516
00:22:57,011 --> 00:22:59,250
you gotta move the crosshairs and get 
them in line.

517
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,280
We haven't been lying me,
I'm in like,

518
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,180
no,
it's fine.

519
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,500
I mean they could do it so fucking 
quick.

520
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,740
I mean that would be some crazy shit if 
you could have drones and have like that

521
00:23:06,741 --> 00:23:11,390
guy fatality and fatality is like the 
baddest motherfucking quake player ever.

522
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,840
This dude is just ridiculously accurate 
with his mind and a cool guy too.

523
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:15,860
Met Him.
Very nice guy.

524
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,640
But if you've got that guy playing for 
your army and you got drones with 

525
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,820
missiles in it from that fucking guy,
holy shit.

526
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,340
You know,
that's the future man.

527
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,900
Welcome to the new world.

528
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,740
It's pretty crazy how how video games 
have exploded from something that used 

529
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,820
to be like,
like Little Ping pongs.

530
00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:38,060
Now people have like amazing video games
on their phones.

531
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:43,750
Credible man.
Just look at what you can do with your 

532
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,300
iphone playing all these different 
racing games and shit.

533
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,550
We were working on the new UFC.

534
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,740
A fight game.
Fuck.

535
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:53,741
It's amazing man.
When you watch some of the graphics and 

536
00:23:53,741 --> 00:23:54,170
Shit,
like they dive for knee bars,

537
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,410
they get triangles,
they throw head kicks and punches,

538
00:23:57,411 --> 00:24:00,440
flying knees and shit.
You see all this crazy shit.

539
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:05,441
All these different techniques they can 
do just like in real fighting and it's 

540
00:24:05,441 --> 00:24:08,621
like it's so close to being like a video
that you like on an actual UFC fight 

541
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:14,951
that you can manipulate,
you know the the limit is in the 

542
00:24:14,951 --> 00:24:18,341
controller.
I think what eventually is going to 

543
00:24:18,341 --> 00:24:18,341
happen as you're going to have a god 
damn suit on,

544
00:24:18,341 --> 00:24:22,750
you're going to have a fucking suit on 
or you're just gonna have this little 

545
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,941
wire plugged in on your forehead and 
you're just gonna think that could 

546
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:28,271
happen,
but Microsoft is very close to 

547
00:24:28,271 --> 00:24:28,271
developing the whole system where you 
interact with the game.

548
00:24:28,271 --> 00:24:28,610
What's it called?

549
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:31,430
Nitel.
It comes out like I think November or it

550
00:24:31,431 --> 00:24:36,431
might have got pushed to spell it and in
a t a l and it's pretty much just like a

551
00:24:36,651 --> 00:24:41,651
camera or something that sits on top of 
your TV and in readership motion range 

552
00:24:41,651 --> 00:24:41,651
of motion.
That's.

553
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,700
That's incredible because that's going 
to be fucking cool.

554
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,880
Imagine having like a UFC game where you
could learn how to fight without 

555
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,331
actually fighting.
My problem with that whole thing is I 

556
00:24:52,331 --> 00:24:53,510
think maybe if I was a kid I would've 
loved it,

557
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,950
but when I'm playing a video game like I
don't want to have to be doing shit.

558
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:02,090
What you say that doing with right now 
we just wack.

559
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,360
It's this little thing and you're 
playing ping pong and it sort of moves 

560
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,301
the way you want it to.
I did a week hard game once and I was 

561
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:10,301
like,
this is not specific at all.

562
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:11,470
It's not.
It's not rewarding.

563
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:16,510
Yeah,
but it's something about having to like 

564
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:16,510
get up.
Like I want to do a lazy fuck.

565
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:21,070
If I was a kid it might've been better,
but like nowadays I want to play video 

566
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:21,760
games.
I just want to sit there and smoke weed,

567
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:27,360
but that's dependent on the graphics.
What if the graphics were like 3d 

568
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,970
fucking super dope virtual reality type 
shit and you had a virtual gun and 

569
00:25:31,251 --> 00:25:36,251
you're running down a hallway shooting 
at all because it's like you have a gun 

570
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:37,550
in your hand and it reads this gun.
Come on man.

571
00:25:37,551 --> 00:25:42,551
That will be this shit.
And the actual running that you take 

572
00:25:42,551 --> 00:25:43,310
place,
like maybe that would be the shit if you

573
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:46,580
had a fucking warehouse,
like a virtual reality warehouse,

574
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,700
like you enter into the door,
you put on this helmet and it's just a 

575
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:51,700
flat or tag.

576
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,410
Yeah.
But complete three d,

577
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:56,420
virtual reality,
you know?

578
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,260
Yeah.
And if you get close to the walls,

579
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,010
like a little light goes on,
you are getting close to the wall.

580
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,780
That would be good to turn.
Right.

581
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,770
You know?
Yeah.

582
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:04,910
Come on man.
I just,

583
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,960
I,
I've just gotten to the point where I 

584
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,160
did this.
Nintendo we shit just drives me crazy as

585
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,130
boring man.
The we is like playing pool,

586
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,070
but there's no pool cue you're just 
going like.

587
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,640
And you're just no feedback either 
feedback man.

588
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,490
Like I want to click a button and see a 
gun,

589
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:23,170
go off,
you know,

590
00:26:23,171 --> 00:26:25,220
and a click the mouse button and see the
rocket,

591
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,300
you know,
take off,

592
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:31,301
right?
That this whole moving an arm through 

593
00:26:31,301 --> 00:26:31,940
the air that's fucking weak.
That's stupid.

594
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,500
There's this,
I forget what it was.

595
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,950
They just said the other data in the 
future that they're going to use,

596
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
like Google maps and street view and 
Google maps and you're going to be 

597
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,000
playing video games.

598
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,310
Have like your street,
you're going around in your house.

599
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:49,920
You know what I mean?
You should be able to find out if 

600
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,161
someone is playing like fucking doom on 
your street and rolling up your house to

601
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,760
be like,
Hey,

602
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:56,070
just want you to know they should send 
you an email.

603
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,160
It should be like the sims where it's 
like your house is the house in the 

604
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,770
video game and so like if you try to 
break in your house,

605
00:27:01,771 --> 00:27:06,771
they're trying to break into your house.
Like everyone should have their own 

606
00:27:06,771 --> 00:27:07,290
house in the video game.
Yeah.

607
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:08,980
That will be kind of cool.
That would be correct.

608
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,920
Then you would know where everybody,
everyone lives.

609
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:16,580
Killed them.
Video Games have access to I for like 24

610
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:18,720
hours or something like that and you can
run away.

611
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,660
I'm kind kinda shocked.
The virtual reality kind of hit like A.

612
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,610
They,
they.

613
00:27:22,611 --> 00:27:25,470
The technology never really developed 
the way I thought it was going to.

614
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,250
Like,
you know,

615
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:29,000
you heard about that shit like way back 
in the eighties and I thought wow,

616
00:27:29,001 --> 00:27:31,140
like there was movies based on that and 
I was like,

617
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:33,170
I thought like wow,
I remember like um,

618
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:38,850
well sorta dagger.
I don't remember what movie you 

619
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,780
remember.
Total recall with a fucking make you 

620
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:41,780
could dream.
Yeah,

621
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,960
that Shit's coming.
It's a total recall.

622
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:47,700
What was the one with the chick with the
red hair in Puerto Rico.

623
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:52,730
They've already been able to take images
and implant them in people's minds and 

624
00:27:53,911 --> 00:27:57,120
they been able to read images from 
people's minds,

625
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:02,270
like read what you're thinking about.
Like you can look at something and the 

626
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,511
computer,
like there's some sort of sensors that 

627
00:28:05,511 --> 00:28:06,150
they hook up to your brain and then it 
sends the image to a computer and it's,

628
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,700
it can tell what you're looking at.

629
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,910
Like that's nuts man.
Because eventually,

630
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,940
I mean this is in a very rudimentary 
stages of the technology where they can 

631
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,851
only pick out shapes and shit,
but eventually they're going to be able 

632
00:28:19,851 --> 00:28:22,851
to fucking see what you're seeing.
That the element is that what was the 

633
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,860
ticket to red hair?
And fulfillment is that the Bruce Willis

634
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:27,980
movie?
And it had like memories like I'm moving

635
00:28:27,981 --> 00:28:31,160
to the cloud,
like memories in your head how,

636
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,080
how bad ass was Chris Tucker in that 
moment?

637
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,350
Remember?
Who was that crazy alien?

638
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:38,030
Remember?
Lawnmower man was a good movie too.

639
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,750
That's another nutty movie.
But a retard.

640
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:40,390
The one crazy,
right?

641
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,720
Right.
Put a computer in his brain or something

642
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,850
right now.
The Stephen King Book.

643
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,420
Stephen King.
Oh No,

644
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,830
it's strange days.
Was it strange days?

645
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,640
Was another virtual reality.
Something crazy ass.

646
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,090
I think it was strange days.
Strange days.

647
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,750
Let's go right here.
Just sit here.

648
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,930
I can't wait for strategies become true 
if that's what it was.

649
00:29:00,931 --> 00:29:04,590
It was strange.
That was Angela Bassett,

650
00:29:04,591 --> 00:29:06,900
right?
She'll forever be Tina Turner.

651
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,500
Sorry.
Do any other movies.

652
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,930
I don't.
You're your Tina Turner.

653
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,150
Um,
was going to say,

654
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,240
oh,
this fucking Ms Dot Beverly Hills Chair 

655
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,581
about this.
Another one of these beauty pageant 

656
00:29:22,581 --> 00:29:25,080
checks came out saying that she doesn't 
believe that gays should be married.

657
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:30,081
And she,
she quoted Leviticus and the Old 

658
00:29:30,081 --> 00:29:30,081
Testament saying that the,
uh,

659
00:29:30,081 --> 00:29:34,240
you know,
the Bible says that it's some stupid 

660
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,590
quote like any man who lays down with a 
man,

661
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:35,310
as if,
uh,

662
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:40,380
you know,
the same way lays down with a woman 

663
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:40,380
that's an abomination,
should be put to death.

664
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,190
So she came out and said that gays 
should be put to death.

665
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,310
Lucy supporting the Old Testament,
which by the way,

666
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:53,311
I mean,
whatever you fucking want to believe 

667
00:29:53,311 --> 00:29:53,311
about religion,
that's all well and good.

668
00:29:53,311 --> 00:29:53,370
You know,
who,

669
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,210
who knows?
If God is real,

670
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,230
who knows?
I mean,

671
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,780
it could be that,
you know,

672
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,650
the Bible is completely ridiculous 
because God wants things confusing,

673
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,330
but it gets a certain point where you 
read certain things and you got to go,

674
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,580
alright,
every people are full of shit.

675
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,890
And there was no internet back then.
It's not like,

676
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,510
you know,
there was a copy of the,

677
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:16,420
the Bible on Wikipedia and people kept 
altering it.

678
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:17,470
But everybody was like,
no,

679
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,750
that's not what it says.
And they went back and changed it.

680
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,190
You know,
they didn't.

681
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:26,220
The Old Testament,
they didn't even write that fucking 

682
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,130
thing down for like a thousand years.
It was just stories,

683
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:32,400
you know,
and the idea that those stories you 

684
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,250
can't tell,
I can't tell a story to him and he tells

685
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:34,210
it to his girlfriend.

686
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,210
His girlfriend writes it in her blog and
it's the same story.

687
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:42,240
It'll be fucked up for sure.
I can't tell you how many times someone 

688
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,231
has gone to one of my gigs and I've said
something and then a guy like will quote

689
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:52,021
on twitter like I'll do.
That was so funny last night when you 

690
00:30:52,021 --> 00:30:52,021
said this about them,
like,

691
00:30:52,021 --> 00:30:52,330
Tim,
I didn't say that.

692
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,600
Like you're saying something fucked up.
What I said was a lot nicer,

693
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,030
you know,
but when w,

694
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,400
when you realize that memories are so 
fucking,

695
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:03,250
there's no way,
there's no way you can be that accurate.

696
00:31:03,251 --> 00:31:05,500
Over a thousand years were people 
talking about it.

697
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,780
And then on top of it,
the original,

698
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:12,790
uh,
the Old Testament Bible was written in 

699
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:12,790
ancient Hebrew.
And to this day,

700
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,040
the only know three out of four words in
ancient Hebrew,

701
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:20,160
25 percent of the words,
they don't have a clue as to what they 

702
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,160
mean.

703
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,250
Not only that,
letters and numbers were the same thing.

704
00:31:21,251 --> 00:31:26,251
Back then there were no numbers.
So the letter a was also the number one.

705
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:31,500
So there was like numerical value in 
words like the word love in the word 

706
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,600
God.
They have the same numerical value in 

707
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,211
ancient Hebrew.
But as soon as they translated that to 

708
00:31:39,211 --> 00:31:39,880
Latin and Greek,
that shit was all gone.

709
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,990
Let's see.
It was all lost.

710
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:45,910
So for this dumb bitch to sit and think 
that God wants people to put,

711
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:50,860
put the depth of their gay.
Like this is what the Ms Beverly Hills.

712
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,930
It's beverly.
This is a new one,

713
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:57,931
new Ms Dot California.
And California is supposed to be so 

714
00:31:57,931 --> 00:31:57,931
liberal.
It ain't Miss Texas.

715
00:31:57,931 --> 00:31:59,590
Do you know who Carrie Anne can't?
She is or whatever her name is.

716
00:31:59,591 --> 00:32:02,290
She's from celebrity Rehab Niche.
Can each.

717
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,590
She was the one that had the threesome 
with a guy from grey's anatomy.

718
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,910
Anyways,
on this show,

719
00:32:06,911 --> 00:32:08,530
celebrity rehab.
She.

720
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,920
You just want to strangle her now.
I think it's almost with these like 

721
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,651
pageant people,
because I know a couple of these girls 

722
00:32:16,651 --> 00:32:16,651
that did the pageants and stuff like 
that.

723
00:32:16,651 --> 00:32:16,840
They're fucked up in their head and you 
know,

724
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:19,390
they've been doing it all their life.
These little kids have grown up.

725
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,090
You remember last time?
Not last time.

726
00:32:21,091 --> 00:32:26,091
I went to Dallas for the time before 
when there was that little girl pageant 

727
00:32:26,091 --> 00:32:27,570
going on in the hotel,
so you remember that.

728
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,840
That was scary as.
That was the weirdest fucking thing 

729
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,961
ever.
We're hanging out the hotel and there's 

730
00:32:35,961 --> 00:32:35,961
all these little girls.
I mean little like six.

731
00:32:35,961 --> 00:32:40,040
Yeah,
six years old with high heels and makeup

732
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:45,041
on with their hair done and jewelry and 
dresses and you're like,

733
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:50,171
what the fuck is going on here?
That shit is an abomination.

734
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,030
All right.
That is a fucking.

735
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,950
That is a travesty.

736
00:32:55,050 --> 00:33:00,050
I feel like somebody was going wrong in 
the elevator because I was in an 

737
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,260
elevator with two of them and I looked 
at her and I'm like,

738
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:06,470
oh my God,
look like if they were making finger 

739
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:06,470
themselves in front of you,

740
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,400
something's not right there.
Sometimes my daughter will play with.

741
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:11,840
They're posting just other.
No,

742
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,610
I don't want to say this.
That's true.

743
00:33:13,611 --> 00:33:15,560
I mean you were to,
if you have one,

744
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:20,710
but some the other day she was lying 
there and she had her little feet up in 

745
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:23,831
the air,
which is rocking back and forth and she 

746
00:33:23,831 --> 00:33:23,831
just,
two hands just grabs it,

747
00:33:23,831 --> 00:33:24,620
you know?
And uh,

748
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,240
you know,
I don't know what to say.

749
00:33:26,241 --> 00:33:27,460
Like,
what do you say that you go,

750
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,570
don't do that.
You can't tell her not to do that.

751
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,160
That's,
you know,

752
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,910
you don't want to suppress her and get 
her

753
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,610
crazy as I don't want her to be like,
like in kindergarten going,

754
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,930
hey,
anybody,

755
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,390
they all do it anyway.
Dude,

756
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,110
I got news for you.
They all do it.

757
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,480
Don't you remember doing weird shit with
kids when you were a little bit.

758
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:46,490
I played doctor,
me and my friend played soccer with all 

759
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,121
the girls in our neighborhood and I 
remember the only time I remember the 

760
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:52,961
most,
we had three girls lined up and we're 

761
00:33:52,961 --> 00:33:52,961
like,
okay,

762
00:33:52,961 --> 00:33:56,621
we're going to be putting pencils and 
your vagina's take off chance it took 

763
00:33:56,621 --> 00:33:58,490
off other pants and we just went back to
each one.

764
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,210
Then would pull it out and smell it.
And it goes,

765
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:04,190
oh fuck.
But we were all like,

766
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,200
fine,
you can girls lead poisoning.

767
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:10,520
I know they might be retarded now 
because they're all on my facebook too.

768
00:34:10,521 --> 00:34:12,910
So totally,
they're not watching what you shit.

769
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:18,060
It was nice,
but I thought we should ask them all 

770
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,591
questions.
Does anybody remember anything about 

771
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:20,591
pencils?
So you remember me putting up things.

772
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:20,591
So in your crowd,

773
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,950
this was.
So this beauty pageant thing that we saw

774
00:34:23,951 --> 00:34:25,630
at the hotel,
it was dark.

775
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:30,780
I mean it was really dark because there 
was all these Weirdo fucking religious 

776
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:35,290
people with their kids dressed like 
horse and made no fucking sense.

777
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,240
I mean,
no sense because there were,

778
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:37,810
there were,
it was,

779
00:34:37,811 --> 00:34:42,811
um,
we were there on a Sunday and they were 

780
00:34:42,811 --> 00:34:44,401
talking about church,
there was all this church talk and you 

781
00:34:44,401 --> 00:34:45,370
got your girl dressed as a fucking 
prostitute.

782
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,380
Here's a six year old dresses,
a prostitute,

783
00:34:47,381 --> 00:34:50,170
and you're talking about church.
They had high heeled shoes on.

784
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,320
I mean like this high,
which the only reason why shoes have 

785
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,161
heels like that.
And so that women's legs look longer so 

786
00:34:59,161 --> 00:35:01,630
that guys think about them when they're 
pushing these long legs back and fucking

787
00:35:01,631 --> 00:35:03,250
the shit out of you.
That's what,

788
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:06,400
that's for those,
that long leg thing.

789
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,810
Why,
why you think?

790
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,250
What do you think that's there for you?
Sacrificing how you can walk.

791
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:17,460
How about that?
Just so that men want to fuck you more 

792
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,000
than we already do,
which is wait,

793
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:23,010
wait,
what the fuck you to have sex with a 

794
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:25,080
girl that has her shoes on like high 
heels and ever got to know what is up 

795
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,050
with that though.
That's just a porno stuff.

796
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,920
That's ridiculous.
I mean,

797
00:35:26,921 --> 00:35:29,350
I'm sure it's somewhere in my life,
you know,

798
00:35:29,351 --> 00:35:30,620
somebody who's not,
you know,

799
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:33,220
taking everything off that's it's 
possible,

800
00:35:33,221 --> 00:35:35,050
but the,
that someone would like that.

801
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:37,100
But the whole,
I don't like them in the first place.

802
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:41,550
I think it was ugly and it seems to me 
like you're doing something stupid,

803
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,080
you know?
I don't want to be like,

804
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,750
you're getting tricked and you don't 
need to do it for me.

805
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:46,240
Like,
you know,

806
00:35:46,241 --> 00:35:49,360
like my wife always wants to wear these 
high heels when she leaves the house.

807
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,030
I'm like,
okay,

808
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,690
if you want to do that,
that's all good.

809
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,730
But to me it seems like you can't walk 
right?

810
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,000
I'd rather you wear tennis shoes,
but women love them,

811
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:58,140
man.
They love shoes.

812
00:35:58,141 --> 00:36:00,270
They what they love how they look,
they love.

813
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,220
It's like how dudes love cars,
you know,

814
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:07,221
how you know,
like you see like a 69 mustang or 

815
00:36:07,221 --> 00:36:08,550
something like that and you go whoa.
And he like pull up to a dude,

816
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:10,470
look at that motherfucker.
You know what I'm saying?

817
00:36:10,471 --> 00:36:13,320
Like there's something that men have,
like women can go,

818
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:14,760
wow,
that's a pretty car,

819
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,400
but it's not the same as how a dude 
looks at a car.

820
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,480
Well,
for girls,

821
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:22,470
the shoe thing is just,
they really fucking love shoes,

822
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,090
man.
Like makeup and shoes.

823
00:36:24,091 --> 00:36:29,091
It looks like there's the opposite sides
of the body because they're so ashamed 

824
00:36:29,091 --> 00:36:29,091
of the middle.

825
00:36:29,091 --> 00:36:32,990
I think it bleeds.
It's gross to look it up and running 

826
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,450
naturally long.
It's probably something like that.

827
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:47,330
Look how long my legs are and where do 
they go to look up there?

828
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,340
Well,
the,

829
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:50,050
the,
the,

830
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,340
you know,
that's one thing.

831
00:36:52,341 --> 00:36:53,210
If you're a woman,
you know,

832
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:58,211
if you're a grown woman,
that's what you like and what the fuck 

833
00:36:58,211 --> 00:36:58,211
ever.
Who gives a shit?

834
00:36:58,211 --> 00:36:58,211
You want to go pierce your balls,
go do it.

835
00:36:58,211 --> 00:37:01,640
Who gives a shit?
But for little kids that's not,

836
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,700
that's not cool man.
To have a six year old dress like a 

837
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,690
derby and it is disturbing.
It felt very wrong.

838
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,510
You know?
And you know,

839
00:37:10,511 --> 00:37:12,650
like their whole Jon Benet Ramsey case,
man,

840
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,070
that shit disturbed that case yet.
They don't know.

841
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,350
We're going to find out the mother is 
still alive.

842
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,520
I believe the moms dad died.
Maybe the dad's dead too.

843
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,430
It's possible.
Anyway,

844
00:37:22,431 --> 00:37:24,350
no twitter verse.
Yeah.

845
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,540
Twitter versus not cool.
And I agree.

846
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:32,260
No,
I heels are just as much an 

847
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,190
establishment as a male's ty is both are
silly.

848
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,200
That's true.
That's true.

849
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,280
Raun Kaiser.
Goddamn these just twitter shit goes too

850
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:40,700
fast.

851
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:43,570
Yeah,
no,

852
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,070
you're absolutely right.
I think ties are completely ridiculous.

853
00:37:46,071 --> 00:37:47,020
I didn't even,
I,

854
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,040
I haven't worn a tie in a long.
I did a documentary recently on Dmt and 

855
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:58,121
uh,
well I had to wear a tie because I 

856
00:37:58,121 --> 00:37:58,121
played like a rod sterling type 
narrator.

857
00:37:58,121 --> 00:37:59,750
It's a really interesting documentary on
DMT.

858
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:03,020
It'll be out sometime this spring,
but I had to wear a tie.

859
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,670
I had no idea how to tie this fucking 
thing.

860
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:08,060
I had no idea.
The last time I wore a tie was um,

861
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:13,240
my,
my first album grabbed that thing off 

862
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,930
the wall real quick.
My first album in 1999,

863
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,490
you know,
just as a goof,

864
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:20,070
one of the things I always said that I 
love about being a comedian is that you,

865
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:25,071
you don't have to wear a fucking tie.
And so just my first CD for whatever 

866
00:38:25,071 --> 00:38:30,071
reason,
I just thought it would be funny if I 

867
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:30,071
wore a tie.

868
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:30,800
It doesn't make any sense.
Just look strange.

869
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,460
I had to wear a tie for like 10 years 
everyday.

870
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,380
Yeah.
If you want to like work in businessman,

871
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:43,470
it's like there's an agreement,
like everyone has to know that you are 

872
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:47,911
willing to wear something completely 
ridiculous because you're following by 

873
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:52,680
the very obvious rules of behavior.
It's going to be really easy to predict 

874
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,760
what you're doing.
That's what people like.

875
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:56,470
Like I'm a gentleman,
you know,

876
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:58,320
like as a gentleman,
while I feel this,

877
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,210
I'm a gentleman who's got a tie on Hello
Gentlemen,

878
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:02,200
Gentlemen,
Gentlemen.

879
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,440
You know,
it's like there's this like this 

880
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:07,440
agreement that you're not going to get 
too crazy.

881
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,920
You're not going to.
It's like my Dr Phil Impression,

882
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:13,980
you know,
bottom of are showing we are very 

883
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:13,980
slippery.
I'm not chasing after anybody,

884
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,850
you know,
it's like there's something to that.

885
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,880
There's something to this is silly 
outfit that you wear that's 

886
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:20,880
uncomfortable.

887
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,120
Like if people started doing business 
and they had like rash guards on like,

888
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,400
like road rash guards.
I like,

889
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:27,030
they're ready to go do Jujitsu and shit,
you know,

890
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,930
like why,
why would that be bad?

891
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:30,010
But it is bad.
You know,

892
00:39:30,011 --> 00:39:33,340
you can't have like board shorts and you
know what I'm saying?

893
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:38,400
You know,
running shoes on and you look like 

894
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:38,920
you're ready to pounce on people that 
nobody wants that in business.

895
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:43,921
You can have.
When you go to business you have to be 

896
00:39:43,921 --> 00:39:46,021
dressed uncomfortable.
Your button has to be all the way up 

897
00:39:46,021 --> 00:39:46,021
here,
you know,

898
00:39:46,021 --> 00:39:46,120
it's fucking ridiculous.
You know?

899
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,230
Do,
do,

900
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:54,370
do,
do you remember he used to work at this 

901
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:55,940
architect firm for my stepfather and 
this was when I was big into acid and 

902
00:39:55,981 --> 00:39:58,230
stuff like that.
So every time I would come to work I was

903
00:39:58,231 --> 00:40:01,680
either hung over a,
still tripping on acid,

904
00:40:01,681 --> 00:40:02,110
been,
you know,

905
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,160
or something like that.
It was such a boring job that it was 

906
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,730
acceptable because all that I had to do 
is make copies of architect plans.

907
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:14,690
You fucked up your brain on acid.
Do you think you have fucked up your 

908
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:14,690
brain?
Okay.

909
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:15,930
Um,
no,

910
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:16,630
no.
I,

911
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,960
I think,
I think if when I was doing it,

912
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,660
I was,
yeah.

913
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,250
Was there any point that like,
you know,

914
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:26,251
you ever heard Howard stern talks about 
is acid trip know Howard stern talks 

915
00:40:26,251 --> 00:40:29,380
about it on the radio and I guess he did
like a giant dose of acid,

916
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:31,540
like way too much.
And uh,

917
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:35,200
he was all fucked up for like a long 
time,

918
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,870
like he was hearing voices and it was 
just like a,

919
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:41,860
like a real psychotic episode and um,
you know,

920
00:40:41,861 --> 00:40:44,680
that's a really,
that's a thing about psychedelics.

921
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:47,440
So you gotta make sure you don't fuck 
around and do too much.

922
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:51,220
Like Dennis Mckenna had an experience 
like that to Dennis Mckenna,

923
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,520
who's Terence Mckenna's brother.
They're both famous psychonauts for 

924
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,720
psychedelic pioneers in the seventies.
They went to Brazil and he took like way

925
00:41:00,911 --> 00:41:04,390
too much mushrooms and he lost his mind 
for like two weeks.

926
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:06,070
Like he couldn't communicate with 
people,

927
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,310
you know,
and the last time I did DMT,

928
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,850
I was fucking whacked out for like two 
solid weeks.

929
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:17,970
Not totally.
You wouldn't guess if you were talking 

930
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:17,970
to me.
I was totally normal.

931
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:20,830
I did shows the shows went great.
I W I went to work.

932
00:41:20,831 --> 00:41:22,390
I did fear fire.
Did that one great.

933
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,230
Uh,
you know,

934
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,230
nothing.
Nothing got fucked up in my.

935
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,930
But my head was like,
I've felt very,

936
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,910
you know,
you feel like your consciousness is like

937
00:41:30,911 --> 00:41:33,410
in a foundation.
Your consciousness is like,

938
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:35,040
you know,
like it's like boom,

939
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:40,270
solid.
This is me the morning you wake up in 

940
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:40,270
the morning,
hi honey,

941
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:40,270
kiss your girlfriend,
brush your teeth.

942
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,620
This is fucking solid.
When I did the DMT,

943
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:46,550
my consciousness was like a little tiny 
raft in a fucked up ocean.

944
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:48,260
It's like,
you know,

945
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:53,290
like nothing seemed like I kept having 
these ideas that cars were going to come

946
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:57,950
launching themselves over the boundaries
and hit my car while I was driving.

947
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:58,890
And I'm like,
I'm like,

948
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,930
why am I thinking so Mike,
what is this about?

949
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,400
And then I realized that what it was was
these are this idea of worrying about 

950
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,871
possible disasters was my ego's way of 
regaining ground and letting me know 

951
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:17,231
that it has to have a certain amount of 
real estate in reality and that if you 

952
00:42:18,651 --> 00:42:23,651
want to do crazy,
crazy psychedelics and go into other 

953
00:42:23,651 --> 00:42:24,880
dimensions,
communicate with entities and reevaluate

954
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:25,670
your,
you know,

955
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:30,690
your whole position in the world.
And then humankind's positioned with 

956
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,810
each other.
That's all well and good,

957
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:35,930
but there's some real shit in the world 
that the ego has to be there for.

958
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:37,310
And the ego was like sending me a 
message.

959
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:42,340
I'm dude.
But if a fucking car launched itself 

960
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:42,340
out,
you better be fucking paying attention.

961
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:47,191
Like there was a certain amount of,
of where it was such a mind blowing 

962
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:51,761
experience that there was like a 
wrestling match going on in my head 

963
00:42:51,761 --> 00:42:55,931
between my ego in between this new 
information and accepting all this new 

964
00:42:55,931 --> 00:42:57,560
information from the psychedelic trip 
and,

965
00:42:57,561 --> 00:43:00,260
and incorporating it into the way I look
at everyday life.

966
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:00,800
You know.
And like,

967
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:06,130
you know,
you think about someone who's like a 

968
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:06,130
real,
like a shaman.

969
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:06,130
You know,
they're living in the jungle and they're

970
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:10,691
all at peace in the world.
They're not calling people douche bags 

971
00:43:10,691 --> 00:43:10,691
on the Internet.
You know,

972
00:43:10,691 --> 00:43:12,680
there's a certain amount of 
enlightenment that if you achieve it,

973
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,280
it's going to make it very hard for you 
to function in the regular world and I 

974
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,330
think that's one of the most important 
things about psychedelic trips.

975
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:25,331
Like there's a lot of cripples in the 
psychedelic world and then the weed 

976
00:43:25,331 --> 00:43:27,020
world too.
There's a lot of people that they're.

977
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:32,170
They're so into these experiences that 
they can't incorporate it into their 

978
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:37,271
everyday life and they're almost 
crippled in their everyday life because 

979
00:43:37,271 --> 00:43:39,410
of it and no psychedelic experiences 
worth anything.

980
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,790
Unless you can take what you've learned 
from it and enhance regular life,

981
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:48,530
enhance your communication with people,
your relationships with people you know,

982
00:43:48,531 --> 00:43:51,590
enhance the way you look at the world,
enhance your career path.

983
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,120
You know the kind of friends you hang 
around with,

984
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:58,130
unless it can enhance you.
The reality is we live in this world for

985
00:43:58,131 --> 00:44:00,800
eight hours a day or 12 hours a day or 
however long you're awake.

986
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:02,450
This world,
this shit,

987
00:44:02,451 --> 00:44:07,451
this concrete world is real and you have
to manage your way through this and 

988
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,100
psychedelic drugs make it very difficult
to do that.

989
00:44:10,101 --> 00:44:11,090
If you want to have a regular job.

990
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:16,160
I think psychedelics,
what's the main thing with psychedelics 

991
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:16,270
is that opens up a door and like,
like in the past,

992
00:44:16,271 --> 00:44:21,271
like I've been offered dmt but I won't 
do it because I like when I first did 

993
00:44:21,271 --> 00:44:24,510
mushrooms that opened up to a door or 
things I never thought of or saw before.

994
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,000
And it's never gonna go away.
It's,

995
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,740
it didn't damage my head,
but now that I know that exists,

996
00:44:28,741 --> 00:44:31,800
I know it's there and so when acid,
the same thing,

997
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:34,140
but there's a point where I have to go,
okay,

998
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:36,450
is this door,
does this store need to be open?

999
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:39,030
Is this anything positive with this door
being open?

1000
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:43,680
And some drugs are like that for me 
because like a Salvia was the closest to

1001
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:44,850
the point where I was like,
okay,

1002
00:44:44,851 --> 00:44:49,851
that is a scary door that I opened up 
because that just pretty much made 

1003
00:44:49,851 --> 00:44:50,070
everything seem fake.
Like,

1004
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:53,880
like it was like this world is fake.
Everything is fake and I know that's not

1005
00:44:53,881 --> 00:44:58,881
true,
but it opened up that door where I'm 

1006
00:44:58,881 --> 00:44:58,881
like,
okay,

1007
00:44:58,881 --> 00:45:00,070
that's almost too much of a door.
I shouldn't have opened up that door.

1008
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,070
I'm never going to get back.
That.

1009
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,290
That thought of not knowing that was,

1010
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:07,160
that's pretty more pretty much saying 
the same thing.

1011
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,100
It may if you can't bring it back and 
incorporated into your everyday life and

1012
00:45:12,101 --> 00:45:13,810
like sometimes you open up these doors,
you're like,

1013
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,500
the fuck am I going to do with this in 
your everyday life is just whacked out.

1014
00:45:17,501 --> 00:45:20,830
Some people like going back to that,
that fake world so much though,

1015
00:45:20,831 --> 00:45:25,831
and that's where it gets fucking scared.
You know what I think most of those 

1016
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:25,930
people,
their real world is not so hot,

1017
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:31,470
you know?
And that's one of the reasons why it 

1018
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:31,470
becomes an escape,
you know?

1019
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:31,470
And I don't think it should be an 
escape.

1020
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,670
I don't think you should ever escape 
reality.

1021
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,840
You're here.
This is,

1022
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:36,610
this is life.
You know,

1023
00:45:36,611 --> 00:45:39,910
there's life can be magical.
Fucking intense,

1024
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:43,030
fantastic experience if you manage it 
correctly.

1025
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:46,030
But if you just want to escape all the 
time,

1026
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:51,180
I've got to think that you're probably 
fucking up in this life and that's 

1027
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:51,180
imbalanced.

1028
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,360
You know the people that always want to 
go.

1029
00:45:52,361 --> 00:45:57,361
And it's like,
like the same thing with like video 

1030
00:45:57,361 --> 00:45:57,361
games.
I remember I told you about this dude.

1031
00:45:57,361 --> 00:46:01,490
There's this dude who used to be a 
manager at the comedy store that was 

1032
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:02,270
addicted to everquest.
Just completely addicted.

1033
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:02,950
Eight,
10,

1034
00:46:02,951 --> 00:46:05,580
12 hours a day,
lost everything,

1035
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:07,480
lost his job,
lost his life.

1036
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,020
He just was so pale you would see him.
He was so pale,

1037
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:16,170
looked like he never saw sunlight,
like he would order in food and never 

1038
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:17,800
leave the fucking house for days.
And he came down to the comedy store one

1039
00:46:17,801 --> 00:46:18,730
night.
And then of those,

1040
00:46:18,731 --> 00:46:22,870
it's so weird.
I'm so good at making money in my online

1041
00:46:22,871 --> 00:46:27,871
life and so bad in my real life.
It was starting to realize that like 

1042
00:46:27,881 --> 00:46:31,120
he's a fucking loser in this life 
because he's.

1043
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:36,430
He's excited and puts all of his passion
and energy into this other life.

1044
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:41,050
But that's just really because this 
other life is a new and exciting thing.

1045
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:46,320
You know,
a new and artificial thing and he can 

1046
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,241
control it from his computer without 
dealing with emotions and dealing with 

1047
00:46:48,241 --> 00:46:48,241
all the,
you know,

1048
00:46:48,241 --> 00:46:49,720
the fears and anxieties and the real 
world presents.

1049
00:46:49,721 --> 00:46:54,721
But the reality is if we live the life 
in a computer screen and we were offered

1050
00:46:55,031 --> 00:47:00,031
the real world as a video game,
the real world will be so much more 

1051
00:47:00,031 --> 00:47:00,580
fantastic.
You know,

1052
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:05,670
we just don't think of it as being 
fantastic because we're so goddamn used 

1053
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:05,670
to it.
You know,

1054
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:08,770
if we lived life in a computer,
in a computer monitor and that's how you

1055
00:47:08,771 --> 00:47:11,080
were when you were born.
And then one day someone said,

1056
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:11,740
you know,
hey,

1057
00:47:11,741 --> 00:47:16,741
we've developed this new game that 
allows you to go outside and you go 

1058
00:47:16,741 --> 00:47:20,311
outside and you'd actually get laid and 
they can go and have a real drink and 

1059
00:47:20,311 --> 00:47:20,311
you feel it.

1060
00:47:20,311 --> 00:47:21,270
You do a real shot of Jack Daniels would
go,

1061
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,840
Holy Shit,
this is real.

1062
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:24,250
I can't believe it.
You know,

1063
00:47:24,251 --> 00:47:27,880
you'd go get laid for real and you drive
a car for rail.

1064
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,940
You'd really like to the world stuff,
fucking shit.

1065
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,920
You would never want to play video 
games.

1066
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:38,070
The reason why we want to play video 
games is because it's a world that we 

1067
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:39,610
can control completely independent from 
all the,

1068
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,420
the,
the,

1069
00:47:40,421 --> 00:47:44,380
the like the pros and cons of this solid
world,

1070
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:49,530
completely independent of the emotions 
and the insecurities and all the shit 

1071
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:50,560
that we all experience but we don't 
like,

1072
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:54,430
but the reason why we experienced 
insecurities and anxiety and anger,

1073
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:59,580
these are all like little chemical 
signals to guide you through towards a 

1074
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,960
proper life.
Like when I've found in life,

1075
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,360
most importantly more than anything is 
that the one,

1076
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:09,070
the way that I'm the most happiest is if
I'm putting out positive energy.

1077
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:10,510
I'm putting out positive energy to 
people,

1078
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:13,120
two friends,
positive energy on stage,

1079
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,710
positive energy with my writing and my 
work with,

1080
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:20,730
with anything I'm doing,
it's all friendly and positive and 

1081
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:20,730
happy,
and if you do that,

1082
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:22,480
you know you can.
You can have a fucking fantastic life.

1083
00:48:22,481 --> 00:48:24,520
The problem is it's just difficult to 
do.

1084
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:27,850
It's hard to keep your shit together.
It's hard not to lose your temper.

1085
00:48:27,851 --> 00:48:32,470
It's hard not to be obsessed with 
something and get sidetracked and that's

1086
00:48:32,471 --> 00:48:37,471
where like gambling addictions and 
masturbation addictions and all that 

1087
00:48:37,471 --> 00:48:37,540
shit,
that's what that's all about.

1088
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:39,540
It's like you're trying to distract 
yourself from,

1089
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:43,120
from all the pain of being a human,
you know?

1090
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:48,360
I mean,
I think fucking hunter s Thompson had a 

1091
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,181
quote like that,
like a man making himself a beast to,

1092
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,800
to get away from the pain of being a 
man.

1093
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:57,100
I forget exactly what the quote was,
but something along those lines,

1094
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:01,570
like we distract the shit of ourselves 
because the game of life is fucking hard

1095
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:01,900
to do.

1096
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,000
It's just like a video game is hard to 
do.

1097
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:09,200
You know,
you remember like back when I used to 

1098
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:09,940
play quake like all the time I played 
quake like hours and hours a day and you

1099
00:49:09,941 --> 00:49:14,941
and I played quake online.
We played against each other and like 

1100
00:49:14,941 --> 00:49:17,911
you can tell the difference between 
someone who's playing all the time 

1101
00:49:17,911 --> 00:49:17,911
because you,
you,

1102
00:49:17,911 --> 00:49:18,010
you get really good at it.
You know,

1103
00:49:18,011 --> 00:49:19,870
you know where the rockets are going to 
go.

1104
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:22,610
And I was sticking rail guns up your ass
and electric.

1105
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:25,960
I think you want 120 games.
And I won one.

1106
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:27,910
Maybe not,
hopefully not fair.

1107
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:29,080
And like.
And believe me,

1108
00:49:29,081 --> 00:49:30,790
there's dudes online that would do that 
to me.

1109
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:32,380
Just raped me.
Why?

1110
00:49:32,381 --> 00:49:35,320
Because they had put so much time in 
this fucking crazy game.

1111
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,960
They would get good at it.
But since you hadn't put time,

1112
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:39,160
how frustrating was it?

1113
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:42,580
So she didn't want to play right now I'm
want to shut it off.

1114
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:44,500
Yeah,
that's exactly the same as life.

1115
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:48,340
If you get good at life with the game,
then it's fun as fuck.

1116
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,930
It's awesome.
You know,

1117
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,780
if you're Leonardo Dicaprio,
life must be the shit.

1118
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:57,900
You know what I'm saying?
He started in movies driving a Ferrari 

1119
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:58,210
for models.
What?

1120
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,170
He's got a gigantic fucking mansion.
I mean he's a,

1121
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:02,910
he's a movie.
Had been.

1122
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:07,930
Must be so fun for him.
But not everybody can be Leonardo 

1123
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:11,490
Dicaprio.
So if you're the fucking garbage man 

1124
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:11,490
who's,
you know,

1125
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:13,090
came home and his wife is fucking the 
newspaper Guy.

1126
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,920
You know,
that's not a fun life.

1127
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:15,660
That's a,
that's,

1128
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:19,880
that's just like a guy who's not good at
quick getting murdered in a game.

1129
00:50:19,881 --> 00:50:20,860
It's not fun,
man.

1130
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:22,540
It's like playing pool.
If you're good.

1131
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:24,010
Like I played pool,
I love pull up,

1132
00:50:24,011 --> 00:50:26,260
I get obsessed with it,
but I have a friend,

1133
00:50:26,261 --> 00:50:31,261
my friend Max eberly,
he's a professional and he's a top 

1134
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:31,261
professional.

1135
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:33,440
I mean he's capable of winning when he's
in stroke,

1136
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:35,390
capable of winning any tournament in the
world.

1137
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:40,391
I mean he's really fucking good and when
I play against him sometimes it's so 

1138
00:50:40,391 --> 00:50:44,710
frustrating and I played pretty good.
Like for a regular person I played good 

1139
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:47,570
but for like a pro,
not even fucking close.

1140
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:52,660
So when I play Max it's just getting my 
ass handed to me it's just getting 

1141
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:56,561
fucked.
The only time it's fun is when we play 

1142
00:50:56,561 --> 00:50:56,561
on a really,
really tight table,

1143
00:50:56,561 --> 00:50:58,010
so occasion when he misses and then I'd 
be like,

1144
00:50:58,030 --> 00:50:58,910
oh,
I get to shoot,

1145
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:01,970
you know?
So he's much better at that game.

1146
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:03,550
We used to give him a handicap.
Sorry,

1147
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:04,640
sorry.
Well we know,

1148
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:06,350
we just,
we don't play for anything.

1149
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,080
It's good for me.
It's good for me because you get used to

1150
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:10,040
playing against a guy like that.

1151
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,710
It's not as fun as playing against a guy
who's like your speed,

1152
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,920
but it's really good for your game 
because it makes sure that you 

1153
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,130
capitalize on every mistake.
Sometimes you'll play a guy who's not as

1154
00:51:19,131 --> 00:51:21,500
good as you and you're like,
I don't worry about this because,

1155
00:51:21,501 --> 00:51:23,270
uh,
if I miss this guys gonna Miss,

1156
00:51:23,271 --> 00:51:26,030
and I'll have another shot with Max.
Every time you miss,

1157
00:51:26,031 --> 00:51:26,690
you're like,
fuck,

1158
00:51:26,691 --> 00:51:29,030
I better,
I better sit down for awhile.

1159
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,110
Anyway,
I believe that I'm.

1160
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:36,170
The hunter asked quote is actually from 
Samuel Johnson and English author.

1161
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,460
Thank you very much sir.
I thought it was 100 thompson quote.

1162
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:42,290
Thank you.
Cj.

1163
00:51:42,291 --> 00:51:47,291
Mic L Hiney mcelhinney.
It's what about words and names like 

1164
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:51,200
Swartz and anger.
How the fuck did that ever get through?

1165
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:56,270
Like what culture ran out of sounds?
People string together.

1166
00:51:56,271 --> 00:52:01,271
Something nutty like that.
People that like to write in cursive is 

1167
00:52:01,271 --> 00:52:02,810
that is going to be the best cursive 
writing I've ever seen.

1168
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:09,540
Manuscripts.
Slaves to write it on a page and they 

1169
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,520
didn't have lines in the paper.
They just had paper and they would write

1170
00:52:10,521 --> 00:52:11,330
it.
Exactly.

1171
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:14,360
Have you ever heard of the Voynich 
manuscript?

1172
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,500
The voynich manuscript?
I don't know if I'm saying it right,

1173
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:22,040
is this ancient manuscript that was a 
found a ton,

1174
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:27,041
hundreds,
hundreds of years old and they have no 

1175
00:52:27,041 --> 00:52:29,591
fucking idea what it says.
They don't know the language covered 

1176
00:52:29,591 --> 00:52:29,591
under any.
Think about it.

1177
00:52:29,591 --> 00:52:33,970
They don't know if it's just nonsense.
If some guy was just practicing 

1178
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:34,550
scribble,
but it's like really long and it's A.

1179
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:37,070
Yeah,
and his consistency in how it's written,

1180
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:42,071
but they can't decode it.
They've had like top encryption experts 

1181
00:52:42,071 --> 00:52:44,570
and it's like it's very divided.
Some people believe it's a hoax and some

1182
00:52:44,571 --> 00:52:48,170
people believe that it's some fucking 
lost language and some people think that

1183
00:52:48,171 --> 00:52:53,171
it's gloss gloss of Lelea,
like when someone talks in tongues and 

1184
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:54,130
that they just went into a fucking 
trans.

1185
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,770
Some retired with a pennant now because 
it's got really good writing.

1186
00:52:57,771 --> 00:53:02,771
It's got diagrams in it and really good,
really good illustrations rather and 

1187
00:53:02,771 --> 00:53:03,770
diagrams and it's like a weird.
Yeah,

1188
00:53:03,771 --> 00:53:05,420
it's really complicated,
you know,

1189
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:10,510
and they found that uh,
that temple and Turkey that is 7,000

1190
00:53:10,611 --> 00:53:14,670
years older than the Pyramids are very 
complex stone temple carved out of stone

1191
00:53:14,671 --> 00:53:17,180
and shit and now they have to like 
rewrite,

1192
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:22,210
like human history because like 7,000
years before Egypt has 9,000,

1193
00:53:22,341 --> 00:53:24,470
10,000
BC and 10,000

1194
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:29,471
BC,
they were already like had temples and 

1195
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,401
we're worshiping shit.
And like that throws a monkey wrench 

1196
00:53:31,401 --> 00:53:32,180
into the whole gears of,
of the,

1197
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:35,040
the,
the idea of a cultural evolution,

1198
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:40,400
you know.
And there's this been this Guy John 

1199
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:40,400
Anthony West,
John Anthony West,

1200
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,880
look that up on Google because this guy 
is fascinating.

1201
00:53:41,881 --> 00:53:46,881
He's got an awesome DVD series called 
magical Egypt and this guy is obsessed 

1202
00:53:47,011 --> 00:53:47,490
with Egypt.

1203
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:52,490
He spent his entire life studying Egypt 
and he believes that the Egyptian 

1204
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:54,990
culture goes back way,
way,

1205
00:53:54,991 --> 00:53:59,991
way before the established timelines.
Like the established timelines for 

1206
00:53:59,991 --> 00:54:01,140
Egyptian culture is like 2,500
BC.

1207
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:06,320
That's when they think like the pyramids
were built and that the culture goes 

1208
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:06,320
back a little bit before that,
but not much.

1209
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,790
And he thinks it goes back like 35,000
years,

1210
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:11,430
he thinks that people have been around 
way,

1211
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:14,780
way longer and that there was some big 
break somewhere along the line,

1212
00:54:14,781 --> 00:54:18,450
like probably some sort of a natural 
cataclysmic disaster,

1213
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,820
like a meteor impact or something like 
that,

1214
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:21,750
you know,
and it could be,

1215
00:54:21,751 --> 00:54:22,560
you know,
10,000,

1216
00:54:22,561 --> 00:54:23,520
15,000
years ago,

1217
00:54:23,521 --> 00:54:28,521
like they don't know when it was,
but they think that there was like an 

1218
00:54:28,521 --> 00:54:30,971
advanced culture and then boom,
it got fucked up and then culture 

1219
00:54:30,971 --> 00:54:33,060
rebuilds,
society rebuilds and then what's left is

1220
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:38,061
like they're living in the shit that was
made thousands and thousands of years 

1221
00:54:38,061 --> 00:54:39,210
ago and they tried to imitate it and 
recreate it and they can't.

1222
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,850
And he believes that that's what it is.
Like these,

1223
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:43,150
these fucked up here,
man.

1224
00:54:43,151 --> 00:54:48,151
So they have in Egypt.
It's not that these pyramids were like 

1225
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:48,540
the first pyramids,
he thinks much,

1226
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:51,540
much more likely.
These pyramids were probably like,

1227
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:54,180
people were like trying to duplicate 
other shit,

1228
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:56,340
duplicate shit that was already there.
You know,

1229
00:54:56,341 --> 00:54:58,770
they believe that that's don't actually,
that's not his theory.

1230
00:54:58,771 --> 00:55:00,920
That's someone else's theory.
His theory is I'm,

1231
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,900
one of the things is about the Sphinx.
They brought in geologists,

1232
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,480
the geologists have like documented the 
erosion on the sphinx and they say 

1233
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,070
there's water or roadnet like thousands 
of years of rainfall,

1234
00:55:11,071 --> 00:55:14,760
of cut deep fissures in the whole entire
enclosure with a sphinxes.

1235
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:20,180
And the problem with that is the last 
time there was rainfall in the Nile 

1236
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,450
Valley was like $709,000
BC.

1237
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,100
So that would mean that the,
the,

1238
00:55:23,101 --> 00:55:25,680
the,
the Pyramids and the Sphinx rather would

1239
00:55:25,681 --> 00:55:30,681
have to be like 7,000
years older than the established 

1240
00:55:30,681 --> 00:55:30,681
timeline.

1241
00:55:30,681 --> 00:55:31,940
And so of course,
none of the,

1242
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:34,470
uh,
the egyptologists like the guys who have

1243
00:55:34,471 --> 00:55:37,350
been teaching forever,
that the Pyramids and the Sphinx and all

1244
00:55:37,351 --> 00:55:39,030
that was built about 2,500
BC.

1245
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,650
They never want.
They don't want to accept it.

1246
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:41,190
They go,
well,

1247
00:55:41,191 --> 00:55:42,690
where's the evidence for this culture?
Like,

1248
00:55:42,691 --> 00:55:43,680
it's right there,
man.

1249
00:55:43,681 --> 00:55:46,950
There's fucking rainfall for thousands 
of years have created this.

1250
00:55:46,951 --> 00:55:51,030
And geologists are universal about that.
There's no one is disputing that.

1251
00:55:51,031 --> 00:55:53,150
The geologists are all saying he's got 
hung.

1252
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,700
This guy ron shock,
who's a,

1253
00:55:54,701 --> 00:55:57,180
uh,
I'm a professor at Boston University,

1254
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:00,930
has got over 100 professional,
uh,

1255
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:06,410
professors geologists to sign off on the
fact that this is undoubtedly water 

1256
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:11,931
erosion,
which completely changes the timeline 

1257
00:56:11,931 --> 00:56:11,931
for when the,
the,

1258
00:56:11,931 --> 00:56:13,590
uh,
the Sphinx was built and there's a bunch

1259
00:56:13,591 --> 00:56:15,450
of that shit going on in,
in Egypt.

1260
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,160
They believe that it's like probably,
you know,

1261
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,010
maybe even 30,000
years old,

1262
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:25,040
there's a mass extinction took place on 
the earth somewhere around 10,000

1263
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:26,770
years ago.

1264
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:32,160
And uh,
that's when the woolly mammoth died 

1265
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,240
instantaneously.
That's when the saber tooth tigers died.

1266
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:37,600
Noah's Ark now this before,
but the,

1267
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:39,730
the um,
like 10,000

1268
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:41,350
years ago,
North America,

1269
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:45,040
like half of North America was under a 
mile high sheet of ice.

1270
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:50,340
Like there was an ice age going on and 
something killed it and ended it like 

1271
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,280
instantaneously and they don't know what
it was.

1272
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:56,520
And it's very,
very likely that it was a fucking 

1273
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,981
natural disaster.
It's very likely that it was a fucking 

1274
00:56:58,981 --> 00:57:01,321
meat here impacted some what happened.
That guys are distracting the shit out 

1275
00:57:01,321 --> 00:57:01,321
of me.
So I don't look at me,

1276
00:57:01,321 --> 00:57:06,120
well,
don't fucking have a monitor open in 

1277
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,831
front of me,
Dude Surf and he's not even paying 

1278
00:57:07,831 --> 00:57:07,831
attention.
We do one week podcast.

1279
00:57:07,831 --> 00:57:08,830
This dude is so addicted to the 
Internet.

1280
00:57:08,831 --> 00:57:11,740
He can't even talk for one week.
I've heard you talk before,

1281
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:14,350
you've heard me talk about this is 
online,

1282
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:16,030
dude,
there's 675 people,

1283
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:18,090
but have not heard this story.
Don't look at him.

1284
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:19,030
Shut up,
faggot.

1285
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:26,730
Anyway,
I think people have been around way 

1286
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:28,681
longer.
I think it's much more likely that it's 

1287
00:57:28,681 --> 00:57:31,321
just really ridiculous that people still
don't believe in and how long this 

1288
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,070
world's been around.
You know what I mean?

1289
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,560
Oh,
like people have believed the earth,

1290
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,380
10,000
years old.

1291
00:57:35,381 --> 00:57:37,330
It just drives me crazy.
Well,

1292
00:57:37,331 --> 00:57:42,331
you know,
that's how not monster number more than 

1293
00:57:42,331 --> 00:57:42,331
50 percent of America,
according to a Gallup poll,

1294
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:46,570
which is not the same because I'm the.
Here's the thing about poles.

1295
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:50,260
You can't say like according to a recent
poll,

1296
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:52,690
50 percent of Americans believe this 
because,

1297
00:57:52,691 --> 00:57:53,500
no,
no.

1298
00:57:53,501 --> 00:57:58,501
According to your recent poll,
50 percent of Americans who are fucking 

1299
00:57:58,501 --> 00:57:59,510
retarded enough to answer your poll,
believe in that.

1300
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:04,730
That's the reality of polls are never 
representative of anybody intelligent 

1301
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:06,550
because you can't get me to answer a 
fucking pole.

1302
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,260
We can't get you.
You got shit to do.

1303
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:10,420
Don't you have a hobby?
You hear somebody calls you.

1304
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:12,170
May I have five minutes of your time?
No,

1305
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,990
that's for like old ladies who have no 
friends.

1306
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:15,390
So that's what that is.
A mom.

1307
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:19,720
Look at this glitter more.
I'm fucking super baked and I just don't

1308
00:58:19,721 --> 00:58:21,250
want to hang up from a person and I'm 
like,

1309
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:22,990
I'm okay.
Five minutes.

1310
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,820
Okay.
I'm trying to be nice.

1311
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:27,880
But the reality is polls.
Polls represent the retards.

1312
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:28,620
You know,
you're,

1313
00:58:28,621 --> 00:58:29,170
you're,
you're,

1314
00:58:29,171 --> 00:58:30,520
you're a fucking,
you're a dollar.

1315
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:31,950
You're answering polls.
Goddammit.

1316
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,310
Anytime I do a poll as if I think I'm 
going to win something,

1317
00:58:36,311 --> 00:58:41,311
if I answer,
20 percent of Americans can't fund the 

1318
00:58:41,311 --> 00:58:42,100
United States on a globe.
Is that True Joe?

1319
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:45,100
Beef don't be lying.
Job is line job.

1320
00:58:45,101 --> 00:58:49,870
If it didn't make that shit up.
Solar flares up in 2012,

1321
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:53,230
bro.
We're clashing the galactic equator than

1322
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:53,920
you know what?

1323
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:56,740
You know,
there's a guy which is Richard Tyson.

1324
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:58,900
Is that his name as a.
What is that guy's name?

1325
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:01,720
The astronomer.
Really?

1326
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,130
Neil Tyson.
Neil Tyson.

1327
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:08,520
Very,
very intelligent guy and I really like 

1328
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:08,980
listening to them talk and one of the 
things he said about this whole crossing

1329
00:59:08,981 --> 00:59:12,790
the aquatic whatever.
What is it?

1330
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:16,780
What is the exact way this guy,
galactic equator.

1331
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:19,270
I think that's what this guy said.
I'm the.

1332
00:59:19,271 --> 00:59:24,271
Yeah,
like we're crossing the center of the 

1333
00:59:24,271 --> 00:59:24,271
galaxy.
We were.

1334
00:59:24,271 --> 00:59:26,870
Everything's in line on December 21st 
2012.

1335
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:29,180
You know what he says?
He says that happens all the time.

1336
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:35,120
Says he says that like that,
like line up with the center of the 

1337
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:35,260
galaxy.
That's it doesn't,

1338
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:40,320
it doesn't happen then because goes,
it happens all the time and nothing 

1339
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:43,541
happens.
So who knows if he's right or if he's 

1340
00:59:43,541 --> 00:59:43,700
one of those guys.
It's like super skeptical,

1341
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:48,850
but I think what's much more likely it's
going to happen in 2012 or something 

1342
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:48,850
technological.

1343
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:51,650
Something technological,
some crazy invention,

1344
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:54,170
you know,
like I don't think it be anything.

1345
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,720
It could be that too.
It could be that 2012.

1346
00:59:56,721 --> 01:00:00,080
What really happens is nothing happens 
and then people realize,

1347
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:02,450
oh,
we have to actually manage this life.

1348
01:00:02,451 --> 01:00:04,910
We can't just rely on fucking aliens 
landing.

1349
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:08,390
I was more scared about 2000 just 
because if that makes sense.

1350
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:11,240
All the computers,
planes dropping from the sky.

1351
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,500
I was scared to.
I didn't.

1352
01:00:12,501 --> 01:00:15,300
Um,
I didn't do a Gig in 2000.

1353
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:20,410
I stayed home.
I thought for sure there was at least 

1354
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:20,410
going to be something small when 
thousand dollars.

1355
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,610
Isn't it crazy that that's 10 years ago 
now.

1356
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,170
Time is just fucking flying by man.
It's crazy fast.

1357
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:32,250
Too Weird.
It almost feels like it's quicker every 

1358
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:34,390
year and everybody says that.
But what time really is quicker would if

1359
01:00:34,391 --> 01:00:39,391
like clocks are moving quicker to.
We just can't really establish it 

1360
01:00:39,391 --> 01:00:40,100
because that wouldn't make sense because
what about digital clocks?

1361
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,970
They all exist in,
in this fucking dimension.

1362
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,740
Maybe there's a dimension is moving 
quicker.

1363
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:51,190
Units of timer know almost.
I think we're forgetting more so it 

1364
01:00:51,771 --> 01:00:56,771
feels like we're forgetting more than 
the day because we have more 

1365
01:00:56,771 --> 01:00:58,781
information.
Maybe thoughts on those guys movement,

1366
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:09,100
you know,
what I think about zeitgeists and all 

1367
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:09,100
that stuff.
There's a lot of.

1368
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:12,860
It's poorly researched like the stuff 
that he said about Mithra and different,

1369
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:18,490
different gods and stuff that,
that are just like Jesus loved was 

1370
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:21,110
really poorly researched and incorrect 
and been proven wrong.

1371
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:22,930
There's a website that says,
uh,

1372
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:28,470
I think it's a common debunkings I guys 
or something like that.

1373
01:01:28,971 --> 01:01:29,830
I forget what the,
uh,

1374
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:35,050
what the website is titled,
but I mean the guy just breaks down all 

1375
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:36,680
the errors that the dude who made the 
movie made and it's just,

1376
01:01:36,681 --> 01:01:37,540
you know,
he's,

1377
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:42,230
he's quoting references and showing very
clearly that,

1378
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:42,790
uh,
the,

1379
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,050
the guys guys made some big problem,
big,

1380
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:49,970
big fuck ups and I think his whole,
how sure he is.

1381
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:52,880
That's September 11th was,
was,

1382
01:01:52,881 --> 01:01:56,010
um,
designed and the,

1383
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,100
you know,
the uh,

1384
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:02,180
and perpetrated by the US government and
that tower one tower two fell because 

1385
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:03,140
they were,
there were detonated.

1386
01:02:03,141 --> 01:02:04,160
Like,
you're sure that,

1387
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,600
you know,
look,

1388
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:08,840
no one's sure that that's crazy.
You can't say free spot.

1389
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:11,180
Now.
All this talk of free fall speed and the

1390
01:02:11,181 --> 01:02:12,920
towers fell at free.
Fall speed.

1391
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:14,630
Yeah,
they fell pretty fucking fast.

1392
01:02:14,631 --> 01:02:16,670
But that's what happens when shit falls 
apart,

1393
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:21,820
it falls apart pretty fucking fast,
especially shit that's super heavy and 

1394
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:23,430
gigantic and all that weight is on and 
it's all just collapsing.

1395
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,760
Who the fuck knows what happens when you
build a building that way and you fly a 

1396
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:31,140
fucking giant plane filled with jet fuel
into it.

1397
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:34,170
The only way to really know.
I mean you can have theories,

1398
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:39,290
but the only way to really know is to 
build another building and fly another 

1399
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:42,201
jet into exactly the same way and see 
what happens and if it falls down 

1400
01:02:42,201 --> 01:02:44,340
exactly like that one,
then the argument's pretty much over.

1401
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,960
And if it doesn't then you have to go,
well,

1402
01:02:45,961 --> 01:02:47,790
okay,
well what was inside the building?

1403
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:51,810
Did it all burn the same was a,
was it exactly constructed the same?

1404
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,220
You know,
and then you got to try it again.

1405
01:02:53,221 --> 01:02:55,590
I mean,
you have to have more than two buildings

1406
01:02:55,591 --> 01:03:00,591
to go on and everybody's like buildings 
I've never fallen before and the 

1407
01:03:00,591 --> 01:03:02,910
government does some nasty evil shit.
That is absolutely a fact,

1408
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,460
but you don't know.
You don't know what happened there.

1409
01:03:05,461 --> 01:03:10,461
And to say that you know is just as bad 
as people who blindly trust in the US 

1410
01:03:10,461 --> 01:03:15,440
government.
The thing that question that I have a 

1411
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,950
big question about when it comes to 
September 11th is tower seven and if you

1412
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:20,400
watch video online,
there's video of tower seven falling and

1413
01:03:20,401 --> 01:03:22,530
it falls just like a controlled 
demolition.

1414
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:26,630
I mean it just goes straight down all at
once and it's,

1415
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:29,220
it's really crazy to watch man,
you know,

1416
01:03:29,221 --> 01:03:34,221
because like it implodes from the 
basement down in every level falls apart

1417
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:38,040
including like jets of,
of energy,

1418
01:03:38,041 --> 01:03:39,360
like spraying out of windows.

1419
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:44,360
Like there's blasts.
I mean maybe that could be because it's 

1420
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:47,160
collapsing.
I mean that's a whole floor of error 

1421
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:47,160
being registered.
That one.

1422
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,450
But the problem is it all falls the 
exact same time in that building wasn't 

1423
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:52,980
even hit by a plane.
It was on fire and it had a whole minute

1424
01:03:52,981 --> 01:03:55,980
from like debris and stuff and I could 
see it falling down,

1425
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,740
but there was a hole in one corner and 
the whole,

1426
01:03:58,741 --> 01:04:03,741
if it's a hole there and the building's 
going to collapse when it collapsed 

1427
01:04:03,741 --> 01:04:03,741
towards the whole.
I mean,

1428
01:04:03,741 --> 01:04:03,741
doesn't that make sense?

1429
01:04:03,741 --> 01:04:05,420
Maybe the.
It also makes sense.

1430
01:04:05,421 --> 01:04:07,730
The whole poc,
standing on a pop can thing.

1431
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:11,030
Wherever you stand on a pop,
can you knock a little bit off the side?

1432
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:12,410
It's not,
you're not falling over,

1433
01:04:12,411 --> 01:04:14,450
you're going straight down the wave.
You know,

1434
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:17,330
meaning it's so heavy.
Even if there's a hole on it,

1435
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:20,300
it doesn't matter.
It's just going straight down and that's

1436
01:04:20,301 --> 01:04:21,770
maybe,
maybe I,

1437
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:23,360
I think with all that shit,
I'm like,

1438
01:04:23,361 --> 01:04:28,361
yeah,
I'm glad there's people that freak out 

1439
01:04:28,361 --> 01:04:28,361
about and care about it because without 
them,

1440
01:04:28,361 --> 01:04:31,780
you know,
the government's going to get away with 

1441
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:31,780
a bunch of shit.
But in my opinion,

1442
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:34,681
you know,
I don't care if the government didn't 

1443
01:04:34,681 --> 01:04:34,681
fuck they did it,
you know,

1444
01:04:34,681 --> 01:04:35,420
I'm still waking up eating cereal.

1445
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:38,170
Well that is one thing you have to 
consider.

1446
01:04:38,171 --> 01:04:39,240
I mean,
it's like you,

1447
01:04:39,241 --> 01:04:39,850
you,
you mean,

1448
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:44,880
how is this going to help you?
How's this going to help you in your 

1449
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,241
life?
I know if you get obsessed with this 

1450
01:04:47,241 --> 01:04:49,340
much tears,
here's the bottom line people to think 

1451
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:50,320
the government wouldn't kill people and 
nobody died and tower seven supposedly,

1452
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:56,010
but the people don't believe people 
think the government would not kill 

1453
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:58,840
people.
This is all you need to know for sure.

1454
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:01,180
They start wars.
Then don't need to be started.

1455
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:06,210
That's 100 percent fact for sure.
The Gulf of Tonkin incident that got us 

1456
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:10,351
into the Vietnam war,
that was a fake fucking attack on 

1457
01:05:10,351 --> 01:05:11,830
Americans.
They faked it and they faked it and made

1458
01:05:11,831 --> 01:05:16,831
this big deal about it so that everybody
would get fired up and realize we have 

1459
01:05:16,831 --> 01:05:16,831
to go to Vietnam.
That's fact.

1460
01:05:16,831 --> 01:05:17,890
This is history.
You know,

1461
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:21,850
and the fact that they wrote up a thing 
called operation northwoods.

1462
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:26,880
The northwoods document in the 
northwoods document was they were 

1463
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:27,850
planning attacks on Americans and they 
were going to.

1464
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:32,880
This is in 1962 and they were going,
this was signed by the Joint Chiefs of 

1465
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:32,880
Staff.
By the way,

1466
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,640
and vetoed by Kennedy,
they were going to attack one time,

1467
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:40,650
obey there.
We're going to lob grenades into and 

1468
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:41,830
mortars and to Guantanamo Bay and 
possibly kill American soldiers.

1469
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:45,850
They were going to blow up a jetliner 
and blame it on the Cubans and they were

1470
01:05:45,851 --> 01:05:48,120
going to tell Americans,
we have to go to war with Cuba.

1471
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:49,930
Well,
people are going to fucking die in a war

1472
01:05:49,931 --> 01:05:53,800
for sure and people are going to die in 
a war that Americans didn't want.

1473
01:05:53,801 --> 01:05:58,801
And so they decided to do what's called 
a false flag and make attacks on 

1474
01:05:58,801 --> 01:06:01,240
Americans and blame it on the Cubans and
that's a fact.

1475
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:06,820
They're willing to kill people.
And only 3000 people died in September 

1476
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:07,090
11 for sure.
That's a lot of people.

1477
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:12,120
I'm not making light of it,
but think comparison to how many people 

1478
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:12,790
have died in Iraq during the fucking 
war.

1479
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:17,910
They're talking about like a million 
civilians have died in Iraq since the 

1480
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:17,920
invasion.
A million.

1481
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,450
I mean,
that's fucking right.

1482
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:24,880
Haiti.
I mean millions of people die from that 

1483
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:24,880
earthquake in Haiti,
but we didn't have it.

1484
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,660
Hd video fucking,
you know.

1485
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,500
Seeing it,
yeah,

1486
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:30,100
but we didn't.
We're not responsible for that.

1487
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:30,790
No,
no,

1488
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:31,510
no.
I know,

1489
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:34,120
but I think the reason why is that 
they're willing to kill people.

1490
01:06:34,121 --> 01:06:34,480
Right,
right.

1491
01:06:34,481 --> 01:06:36,250
I think the reason why we were focused 
on it though,

1492
01:06:36,251 --> 01:06:38,970
it's just because of that,
that we all watched it live where,

1493
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:41,770
you know,
if we saw these people in a racket shot,

1494
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,990
live on tv would probably be just as big
as nine slash 11.

1495
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:46,330
You now.

1496
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,650
Well,
I don't know about that.

1497
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,500
You know,
I think,

1498
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I think.
Well I think the idea was it was an 

1499
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,990
attack on American soil.
I mean that's really what was such a big

1500
01:06:55,991 --> 01:06:57,090
deal.
And then all mean.

1501
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:59,460
I remember how everybody gets so 
patriotic after afterwards.

1502
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:04,830
Do you remember after September 11th,
everybody had fucking American flags on 

1503
01:07:04,830 --> 01:07:04,830
their car.
Remember that weird feeling?

1504
01:07:04,830 --> 01:07:06,560
You were you still in Ohio back then?
Right?

1505
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:08,650
Right.
Did they have them in Ohio?

1506
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:11,830
It was crazy bad.
I left,

1507
01:07:11,831 --> 01:07:16,831
I went to work one day.
I don't even think I was doing fear 

1508
01:07:16,831 --> 01:07:16,831
factor at the time.
I might've been,

1509
01:07:16,831 --> 01:07:20,910
but I was driving down down the street 
near my house and every fucking car had 

1510
01:07:22,181 --> 01:07:25,300
an American flag on it.
It was crazy and I was like,

1511
01:07:25,301 --> 01:07:27,400
this is just weird.
It's a weird feeling.

1512
01:07:27,401 --> 01:07:29,500
It's like,
like people are blowing up,

1513
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:31,720
like they're ready to just go to fucking
war.

1514
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:35,310
You don't realize like how war,
like this fucking culture really is and,

1515
01:07:35,311 --> 01:07:40,311
and how sheep like and how people would 
just immediately willing to fight and 

1516
01:07:40,311 --> 01:07:41,890
fight who don't.
The people who did it are dead.

1517
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:47,260
I think it was a suicide attack.
So the people that were responsible for 

1518
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,210
the deaths of those people are all dead.
I mean,

1519
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:54,810
unless you're one of those crazy 
motherfuckers that doesn't believe that 

1520
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:54,810
it was a real plane.
And then.

1521
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:58,810
And then there's people that believe 
that they were piloted by remote control

1522
01:07:58,811 --> 01:08:01,750
on the planes were emptying.
Who the fuck knows shit happened.

1523
01:08:01,751 --> 01:08:04,510
Almost wait is this almost 10 years,
10 years,

1524
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:06,730
and I'm still talking about it.
Oh my God.

1525
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:10,150
It's so frustrating talking to people 
who claim to know.

1526
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:11,800
That's when it's really frustrating,
man.

1527
01:08:11,801 --> 01:08:13,600
It wasn't a plane hit the Pentagon.
It was a missile,

1528
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,540
whereas all the people that died in the 
fucking plane crash then did they.

1529
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,190
They took them.
And why would they say it's a plane?

1530
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:20,800
Why would they shoot a missile and say 
it's a plane.

1531
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:22,880
Why we're there.
All the plane parts on the lawn.

1532
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:24,080
I mean,
come on,

1533
01:08:24,081 --> 01:08:29,081
man.
You're talking about this before this 

1534
01:08:29,081 --> 01:08:31,980
the plane.
Can we actually last week or two weeks 

1535
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:31,980
ago?
It's fear factor real.

1536
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,260
Nothing is real.
Depends on how much acid you take.

1537
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:36,470
Joe Rogan hates Bruce springsteen is so 
not true.

1538
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,180
It's not true.
You're just trying to get attention,

1539
01:08:38,181 --> 01:08:39,210
motherfucker.
No.

1540
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:44,260
Hey Bruce springsteen born to run.
That's a great fucking brilliant 

1541
01:08:44,271 --> 01:08:46,040
disguise.
That's a great fucking song.

1542
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:52,470
Do I don't love all bruce springsteen.
I'm not going to sit through a three 

1543
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:55,781
hour concert of anybody's.
It would have to be like Richard Pryor 

1544
01:08:55,781 --> 01:08:56,410
would have to come back from the dead.
And Floyd do three.

1545
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:57,970
I might sit through three hours of pink 
Floyd's.

1546
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:58,700
No,
I wouldn't.

1547
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:03,700
I'd get bored.
They don't have three hours of good 

1548
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:03,700
songs,
but.

1549
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:03,700
But I love some,
some,

1550
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:04,820
uh,
Bruce springsteen songs?

1551
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:06,980
No.
Some of them are the fucking shit.

1552
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:12,980
No one is gonna like I bought an old 
rolling stone album the other day 

1553
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:13,280
because it had one song on it that I 
really liked.

1554
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:16,190
I forgot what it was,
but the rest of the album was dog shit.

1555
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:17,990
And that's the rolling stones.
You know,

1556
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:19,880
you think about how many great songs 
they have.

1557
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:21,830
They have a lot of fucking albums,
you know,

1558
01:09:21,831 --> 01:09:24,980
if you go back into some of those older 
albums and listen to some of those songs

1559
01:09:24,981 --> 01:09:28,980
that you don't know shit,
you know,

1560
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,760
not now.
Nobody puts out something that everybody

1561
01:09:31,761 --> 01:09:32,750
loves,
you know?

1562
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:37,751
And if I like,
I mean it's very rare that I like a 

1563
01:09:37,751 --> 01:09:38,090
whole album from a band are real 
orangey,

1564
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:40,760
like with more than 10 people having sex
in the same room.

1565
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:45,950
It's like you walk in and you're like,
what the fuck is going on here at 

1566
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:45,950
origin?
Yanik?

1567
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:46,610
A real unknown.
I've never been on religion of,

1568
01:09:46,611 --> 01:09:47,360
you know,
I,

1569
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:49,790
I just,
it seems like Tampa,

1570
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:51,020
Tampa,
Florida.

1571
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:53,240
So when I was trying to get us to go to 
a sex club,

1572
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:58,380
whereas he got,
had a swingers club that happened again 

1573
01:09:58,380 --> 01:09:58,380
with me and Ari in,
um,

1574
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:00,470
I think it was Nashville,
me and already we're in Nashville.

1575
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:03,910
We had a saint.
This driver who drove us to the UFC,

1576
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,920
drove us to the comedy club,
the same driver all week and then 

1577
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,831
filing.
He's dropping us off at the airport and 

1578
01:10:11,831 --> 01:10:11,831
he's like,
as he's dropping us off,

1579
01:10:11,831 --> 01:10:11,831
I was like,
well,

1580
01:10:11,831 --> 01:10:12,290
if you're ever back in town,
no,

1581
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,730
I have a fucking swingers club that I 
belonged to me.

1582
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:15,920
And I go,
what?

1583
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:18,360
And it was a swingers.
Like,

1584
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,940
yeah,
me and my wife were swingers.

1585
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:25,210
Swingers.
So you let dudes fuck your wife who's 

1586
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:25,210
like,
well,

1587
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:25,210
you know,
she lets me and I have to let her.

1588
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:28,070
What will we get to choose though?
We have veto power.

1589
01:10:28,071 --> 01:10:30,950
That's what we said.
We got veto power like I go.

1590
01:10:30,951 --> 01:10:32,900
So if some dude,
you feel like you can't follow them.

1591
01:10:32,901 --> 01:10:33,680
Oh yeah.
No,

1592
01:10:33,681 --> 01:10:34,190
no,
no,

1593
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:36,590
no,
no big young studs.

1594
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:41,650
Like he's getting old bald fucking 
vacuum salesman.

1595
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:46,310
Band is wide mouth.
I'm like,

1596
01:10:46,311 --> 01:10:47,250
do watch.
He goes down,

1597
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,530
I don't want to watch.
You don't want to watch,

1598
01:10:48,531 --> 01:10:53,531
you don't want to watch your,
your wife is getting fucking stuffed in 

1599
01:10:53,531 --> 01:10:53,531
another room.
How crazy is that bitch?

1600
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,270
You know how crazy it she,
you know,

1601
01:10:56,360 --> 01:11:01,360
whenever I hear about chicks that want 
to fuck like a bunch of different dudes 

1602
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:01,490
at the same time like that.
Is there something.

1603
01:11:01,491 --> 01:11:02,210
I mean,
look,

1604
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:04,340
we're all wired differently and you 
know,

1605
01:11:04,341 --> 01:11:05,360
I like hot sauce.

1606
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,310
You like hot sauce,
like spicy food.

1607
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:10,130
I like really spicy food.
Like I fucked myself up.

1608
01:11:10,131 --> 01:11:14,130
I bought like Dave's insanity sauce on,
on Burritos and I'm sweating.

1609
01:11:14,131 --> 01:11:17,340
Pouring sweat is pouring down my face,
my tongue is on fire now.

1610
01:11:17,341 --> 01:11:19,920
The most people they wouldn't like that.
But I liked that for some weird reason.

1611
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:23,160
Maybe some girls just like Dixon 
everywhere,

1612
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:24,780
you know?
And maybe they like it.

1613
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:26,700
Maybe it's just like they're just going 
crazy.

1614
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,760
Maybe it's not,
but maybe maybe they're broken,

1615
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:33,120
you know,
it depends on the person.

1616
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:38,300
Some of them are for sure fucked up.
There was this girl on the Howard Stern 

1617
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:42,051
show Saturday night got fuck so hard in 
the ass that it tore a hole in her 

1618
01:11:42,051 --> 01:11:42,051
intestines.

1619
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:50,150
It's.
He sewed it back up and then she was 

1620
01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:50,150
talking about how she's just the other 
day had to dixon her ass.

1621
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:52,540
I'm like,
what didn't you once your intestines rip

1622
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:53,790
open?
My God,

1623
01:11:53,791 --> 01:11:58,791
what is this girl?
She's in the New Jersey Shore Porn 

1624
01:11:58,791 --> 01:12:01,260
Jersey whore or something like that.
Someone who knows.

1625
01:12:01,290 --> 01:12:05,520
You guys know there's a bunch of you 
fucking perverts.

1626
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,200
Goddammit.
You people know who it is.

1627
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:09,390
I forget her name,
theresa or something like that,

1628
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:13,110
or whoever was listening to the stern 
show today and I heard that.

1629
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:14,250
Yeah,
Mr Han's,

1630
01:12:14,251 --> 01:12:16,140
that sounds just like Mr Hanson,
but that,

1631
01:12:16,141 --> 01:12:20,010
that a regular Dick doing that too is 
that's even more impressive.

1632
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,450
The Horse Dick.
You look at it and you go,

1633
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:26,480
how does it not kill you?
The most amazing thing about that Mr 

1634
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:26,630
Han's thing,
if you don't know what Mr Hans's,

1635
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:30,810
so the guy who got fucked to death by a 
horse and there's a video of it online,

1636
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,760
you can watch the guy getting fucked by 
the horse,

1637
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:37,110
but the amazing thing is Tom,
they did it tear and Thomas.

1638
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:38,400
Beautiful.
Thank you very much,

1639
01:12:38,401 --> 01:12:40,800
Marty Hubris.
You fucking pervert.

1640
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:46,550
But I'm.
The amazing thing about the horse 

1641
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:46,980
fucking video is that apparently this 
guy had gotten fucked by a horse a bunch

1642
01:12:46,981 --> 01:12:49,320
of times and nothing happened.
Like he was okay.

1643
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:53,340
Like how's that even happened?
Mr Hans is year nine slash 11.

1644
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:56,350
You talk about that shit every day,
you know?

1645
01:12:57,690 --> 01:12:59,160
Is there a.
is there a point where you're like,

1646
01:12:59,161 --> 01:13:04,161
man,
I do talk about fucking horse found a 

1647
01:13:04,161 --> 01:13:05,230
whole lot more than I know because it's 
a bit of my back,

1648
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:07,980
but no,
it's like part of my job.

1649
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:13,010
You remember that Shit.
The face I used to go behind you and 

1650
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:13,010
always make the faces all the time.
Well,

1651
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:15,600
I found myself doing it on normal faces,
so like it'd be my mom,

1652
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,200
like,
hey mom,

1653
01:13:16,201 --> 01:13:18,230
let's take a photo and then back and I'm
like,

1654
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:19,860
Oh,
I'm doing this all the time.

1655
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:24,860
Now I have to stop.
So that's why I stopped in the face 

1656
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:24,960
because it was something that was like 
in my head.

1657
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:29,990
If you don't know what faces,
and this is a thing that went on for 

1658
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:32,340
literally like five years.
Every time I took a picture with someone

1659
01:13:32,341 --> 01:13:32,720
like,
you know,

1660
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:34,620
someone came to a show and they want to 
take a picture with me.

1661
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:39,180
Every time Brian was behind them like 
this and there's,

1662
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,880
we have to organize them and put them 
on,

1663
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:42,570
on my space.
But a lot of them are.

1664
01:13:42,571 --> 01:13:46,770
But the other one of them,
we're talking about no bullshit.

1665
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:51,800
Five years worth of shows.
Thousands and thousands and thousands 

1666
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:56,390
and thousands of pictures.
All with Brian behind it making crazy 

1667
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,391
fucking faces.
I have a picture of me and David Lee 

1668
01:13:59,391 --> 01:13:59,391
Roth and you're behind it.
You're going to fuck though.

1669
01:13:59,391 --> 01:14:04,050
I think the last one I did or the one 
that made me realize I need to stop 

1670
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:06,861
doing it,
but when I did the brock lesnar and I 

1671
01:14:06,861 --> 01:14:06,861
was so drunk and then next day and I'm 
like with them,

1672
01:14:06,861 --> 01:14:10,020
I did not do it with Brock Lesnar did 
with Dana Cookman oh yeah.

1673
01:14:10,021 --> 01:14:11,260
And I did to take tank,

1674
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:14,410
but no,
the brock lesnar one,

1675
01:14:14,411 --> 01:14:16,180
like I was like,
oh I need to stop.

1676
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:19,050
He could've easily kicked my ass right 
then and oh my God,

1677
01:14:19,051 --> 01:14:20,260
I,
I don't have that picture.

1678
01:14:20,261 --> 01:14:22,180
You've got to send that to me.
I'm going to put this up.

1679
01:14:22,181 --> 01:14:23,620
All right.
That's awesome.

1680
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:27,520
I'm going to do it right now because.
Wow,

1681
01:14:27,521 --> 01:14:28,480
I've never seen that photo before

1682
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:32,220
or I'll put that shit up and put it on 
flicker.

1683
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:32,940
Okay.

1684
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:36,140
I do whatever I.
I can't believe I bought David Lee Roth.

1685
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:40,520
I can't wait to.
Well No,

1686
01:14:40,530 --> 01:14:45,530
I shouldn't say this,
but I can't wait to one day where David 

1687
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:45,530
Lee rocked

1688
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:45,560
won't

1689
01:14:46,670 --> 01:14:51,670
be around.
Maybe so we can release that video or 

1690
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:55,010
you won't be at this video of us all 
hanging out with David Lee Roth.

1691
01:14:57,260 --> 01:15:02,260
I don't mean die,
I mean like he doesn't kill him to say 

1692
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:02,260
about it right now because he told us 
not to talk about it.

1693
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:02,260
Oh,
all right.

1694
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,400
I mean he doesn't want the video coming 
out.

1695
01:15:04,401 --> 01:15:06,530
So the last thing we should do is talk 
about what's on the video.

1696
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:10,850
I just say we all sat around and talked,
but we love bullshit,

1697
01:15:10,851 --> 01:15:15,851
man.
You were saying you can't wait until he 

1698
01:15:15,851 --> 01:15:15,851
dies.
You can release it and then then just so

1699
01:15:15,851 --> 01:15:17,450
we can show it to people because it was 
so awesome.

1700
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:18,810
It was awesome.
Yeah.

1701
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:19,220
Right?

1702
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:20,340
Yes,
it was,

1703
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:21,800
it was,
it was just cool talking to him.

1704
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:27,160
It was basically just David Lee Roth 
talking about crazy road stories and 

1705
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:30,401
there's nothing scandalous.
It was just a mean fucking David Lee 

1706
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:30,401
Roth,
you know?

1707
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:35,560
It's just weird hanging out with 
somebody that you grew up as a kid 

1708
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,550
listening to his albums at gold circle 
and yeah,

1709
01:15:37,551 --> 01:15:42,551
it's amazing.
Hanging out with David Lee Roth was a 

1710
01:15:42,551 --> 01:15:42,551
shit.
All right,

1711
01:15:42,551 --> 01:15:42,551
hold on.
I'm going to choose the photo.

1712
01:15:42,551 --> 01:15:43,760
We'll put that shit online.
So.

1713
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:45,120
Yeah.
But this,

1714
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:50,190
this picture of Brian Going nutty behind
David Lee Roth is just indicative of one

1715
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,430
of fucking.

1716
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:57,750
You probably have some of you guys 
probably have photos of me in the 

1717
01:15:57,750 --> 01:16:00,961
background and even know people would 
get so mad with me before.

1718
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:02,810
Just get so mad.
They go,

1719
01:16:02,811 --> 01:16:05,710
you'll joe Bro.
Fuck or doing behind you.

1720
01:16:05,711 --> 01:16:06,280
And I'm like,
no,

1721
01:16:06,281 --> 01:16:07,090
no.
He's my friend.

1722
01:16:07,091 --> 01:16:12,091
He's actually get paid to do that.
Hempy memory came back twice because he 

1723
01:16:12,341 --> 01:16:13,810
was so pissed off or mad.

1724
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:19,020
Well there's weird people that like,
there's weird people that fucking like 

1725
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:25,500
take pictures that they take with you 
and like put them like in their living 

1726
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:29,521
room.
I went to this guy's house once we did 

1727
01:16:29,521 --> 01:16:32,601
this fear factor thing.
Please don't tell me that firefox is 

1728
01:16:32,601 --> 01:16:36,091
fucking crashing against dirty can't.
Oh my God.

1729
01:16:36,131 --> 01:16:38,140
You fucking piece of shit.
Are we still on?

1730
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:41,790
Come on

1731
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:50,750
dude.
Come on.

1732
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:55,220
I don't know.
Oh my God.

1733
01:16:55,221 --> 01:16:56,840
You fucking piece of shit.

1734
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:04,880
God Damn it dude.
We're going to lose this [inaudible] 

1735
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:04,880
recording too.

1736
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,420
I don't think we're to.
What are we doing?

1737
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,990
Go to the show.
What are you trying to.

1738
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:17,110
We froze,
Huh?

1739
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:17,470
Yeah.
