1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,660
I didn't realize how good your hair is.
Thanks.

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:07,503
I'm losing it,
but it's what's left of it is still 

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:09,490
rolling.
Right?

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,660
And we're live.
Gentlemen.

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,830
Hello Sean.
Hey,

6
00:00:11,831 --> 00:00:12,820
how are you?
Hello Tom.

7
00:00:12,821 --> 00:00:13,600
Hello?
Joseph.

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,890
Let's go.
You guys did a movie.

9
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,450
Did you make a movie?
We made a movie.

10
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,980
Did you guys do movies?
We do.

11
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:19,960
We're both the guys.
How many movies have you made?

12
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,510
A one.
Well,

13
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,320
I bet you've made it.
How many of you made before?

14
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,910
Uh,
I like six,

15
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:26,120
but yeah,
but we've made one.

16
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,730
We've made one.
What's your favorite one?

17
00:00:27,731 --> 00:00:28,564
Other than the one that's right now?
Which is definitely a favorite because 

18
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:33,400
you're promoting it right now.
A sex drive.

19
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,070
Sex drive is the one that nobody knows 
about.

20
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,380
This first one,
nobody knows about it.

21
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:39,214
I mean it just,
it was one of those movies that just 

22
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:40,550
opened a.

23
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,780
nobody knew about it,
but it was a,

24
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,270
it was a really,
really fun movie.

25
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,360
Maybe we can change that.
It's on itunes or Netflix.

26
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,081
Yeah.
Yeah.

27
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:48,730
It's all.
Are James Marston's in it?

28
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,653
This is the one.
Is this one that you like when you made 

29
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:52,780
it?
You're like,

30
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,730
and maybe I'll go back to work in 
fucking construction or whatever.

31
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,460
Yeah.
So I thought,

32
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,990
uh,
I thought it was over after that.

33
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,280
Did you finance it or anything?
No,

34
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,200
no,
we made it.

35
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,230
We made it with summit pictures and it 
was,

36
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,580
it was,
it was amazing.

37
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:07,720
They,
they,

38
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:08,554
uh,
we were in town trying to get a career 

39
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:10,900
going,
you know,

40
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:11,743
trying to try and make things happen.
We were making a TV pilot at the time 

41
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:14,794
which was living hell and uh,
and we had gone out and pitch this idea 

42
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:21,100
to a bunch of places and nobody bought 
it.

43
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,750
So then in the middle of our,
uh,

44
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,560
editing our pilot summit pictures called
and said,

45
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,670
um,
we really,

46
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,730
we keep thinking about that pitch.
Would you guys be willing to write it?

47
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,361
And I said,
you know what?

48
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:32,710
I tell them I was really busy.
I said,

49
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:34,240
tell him I'll write it if I can direct 
it,

50
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,550
but I figured that would make them go 
away.

51
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,443
And they said,
all right.

52
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,780
And so we went in and we wrote it and we
turned it in and they green lit it.

53
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,243
It was this crazy,
it was just this crazy process where we 

54
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:46,500
got this movie greenlit and I think we 
wrote the draft,

55
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:47,470
you know,
in like a month,

56
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:50,500
and we turned it in and they loved it 
and they said about it's a,

57
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,900
it's a,
it's a teen road trip movie.

58
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:54,490
It's about this,
these kids that,

59
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,280
uh,
it was kind of in the early days of the,

60
00:01:57,281 --> 00:01:58,114
you know,
facebook and all that stuff and it 

61
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:00,730
might've even been,
I don't know,

62
00:02:00,731 --> 00:02:01,564
I can never track the,
it might've even been like sort of my 

63
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:05,860
space into facebook that era,
you know,

64
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,173
um,
but it was about a kid who meets a girl 

65
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:10,440
online and goes to lose his virginity 
on,

66
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,400
on a road trip.

67
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,990
It's funny.
It is funny.

68
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:14,920
Yeah.
Meyerson's in it.

69
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,460
James Morrison and he was really funny,
uh,

70
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,140
Clark Duke and um,
and I had a good cast and there it is.

71
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,671
Yeah.
Wow.

72
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:23,270
Good.
Um,

73
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,320
but it was a really great experience.
It was really fun.

74
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:27,580
And then we,
we,

75
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,473
we tested it,
we did the test screenings and it just 

76
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,760
murdered,
like,

77
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:32,830
it just in the studio got really 
excited.

78
00:02:32,831 --> 00:02:33,790
And I thought,
oh my God,

79
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:34,624
like I'm going to have a huge career.
And then movie came out and do not do 

80
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,250
any business at all.
I was like,

81
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,710
okay,
I'm going to go back to Wisconsin and,

82
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,540
and uh,
not have a career at all.

83
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,733
So is it true that instant family you 
hired Tom Because Bert Kreischer wasn't 

84
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:48,940
available?
Yes.

85
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,490
God Damn it.
Don't tell me that man,

86
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,750
that's what I'd heard.
Well,

87
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:55,000
and he was asking,
he was asking for a lot of money,

88
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:58,630
a lot more within where it is lofty 
with.

89
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,890
He's like,
Mark's gets,

90
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:02,600
I want double what they were like,
we can't do it.

91
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,510
So this movie is based in,
uh,

92
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,970
in no small part on your own life 
experiences.

93
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,890
It is adopting an actual,
you adopted like a full family and three

94
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:20,890
of them in children.
But how wild.

95
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,570
That's a,
that's a bold maneuver,

96
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:24,430
sir.
What were the ages?

97
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,800
Six.
Three and a year and a half.

98
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:29,500
And Wow,
what was the process?

99
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,690
Um,
well it starts,

100
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:33,970
and this is how it starts in the movie 
as well.

101
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,440
My wife and I,
for years,

102
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:36,274
I didn't,
I wasn't making any money including 

103
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,540
after I made sex drive and um,
I,

104
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,463
uh,
so I didn't really feel like I could 

105
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:44,074
afford to have kids.
So whenever we talk about it I just be 

106
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:46,850
like,
no,

107
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,440
not there yet.
And uh,

108
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,310
and then finally,
um,

109
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,930
when I felt like I was doing better,
I was starting to get a career together.

110
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,960
I just started to feel like I was going 
to be one of those old dads,

111
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:58,150
you know,
like by the time the kid was a teenager,

112
00:03:58,151 --> 00:03:59,620
I wasn't going to be able to play with 
the,

113
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,930
you know,
I'm 49 now.

114
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,670
I was 41 at the time.
And uh,

115
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,310
so God,
is that right?

116
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,330
Oh man,
it's depressing.

117
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,433
Anyway,
uh,

118
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,750
so I,
I,

119
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,700
uh,
I made this dumb joke to my wife.

120
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:13,091
I said,
look,

121
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:13,924
why don't we just adopt a five-year-old?
It'll be like I got started five years 

122
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:18,100
ago and I'm like,
I'm right back in the game.

123
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,680
And she was like,
you know,

124
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,240
that's actually a really interesting 
idea.

125
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:22,931
And I was like,
no,

126
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:25,810
I'm totally kidding.
Didn't mean anything by that.

127
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:26,700
At all,
and,

128
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,783
and then she went to a website and she 
showed me the website and then when I 

129
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:32,830
saw the website I was like,
Oh wow,

130
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:34,420
you see these kids,
you see their faces,

131
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:35,920
you start to learn a little bit more 
about it.

132
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:37,930
And we just started having conversations
and it,

133
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,290
it went from there.
Now now I've got three kids and a movie.

134
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,120
And they're all siblings.
Yes.

135
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,540
So they're all came from one mom.
And would the,

136
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,413
what is,
how did they get separated from the 

137
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,130
family?
Um,

138
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,950
I don't have a lot of details about 
that,

139
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:55,120
you know,
they don't really tell you,

140
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,590
you know,
you know,

141
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:58,180
a little bit,
but not much.

142
00:04:58,181 --> 00:04:59,590
I mean I know that there was,
that,

143
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:00,424
there were issues with drugs and,
and I think there was some kind of a 

144
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:05,050
fire at some point,
but it's all pretty,

145
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,093
pretty sketchy as far as what you hear.
So you've learned a lot about the kids 

146
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,800
themselves,
but not that much about the situation.

147
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,233
And what,
what made you want to turn this into a 

148
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:16,234
film?
Like I would imagine that's a very 

149
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:20,770
personal experience.
Yeah.

150
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,080
Um,
it was actually my writing partner,

151
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:23,914
John Morris,
because I had been about three years 

152
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:28,930
into it at that point and the beginning 
of it was a nightmare,

153
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,300
like,
like epic,

154
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,520
bad decision.

155
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,100
Why did we ever do this?
Yeah,

156
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:36,934
it was,
it was really a nightmare for a short 

157
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:38,884
time.
And then when it came online and we 

158
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:40,744
became a family,
it really became the best thing that 

159
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:43,930
ever happened to me.
And you know,

160
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:44,764
when John and I get together every day,
we just talk about our lives a little 

161
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:48,430
bit.
That's how we get started.

162
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,770
So John had been hearing all these 
stories and one day he just said,

163
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:51,604
I don't know why we're not doing a movie
about this because nobody really knows 

164
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:56,620
how this works when you go into foster 
care to adopt kids.

165
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,590
So we started talking about it and then 
there was the conversation of whether it

166
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:02,690
could be a comedy or not because that's 
what we do.

167
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:04,970
We make comedies.
And John again was like,

168
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,430
most of the stuff you've told me is 
really funny.

169
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,320
So not all of it,
of course,

170
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,273
but that's.

171
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,270
And then we thought,
wow,

172
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,140
we could approach this as a comedy and 
we might be able to get,

173
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,480
you know,
a more general audience to get their,

174
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:23,210
their interest in it that way because 
it'll feel less scary because that's the

175
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:24,044
problem is that most movies that are 
made on this topic just frightened 

176
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:28,550
people and they make people think that 
these kids are all,

177
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,640
are all damaged and reachable anything,
you know?

178
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,053
Do you worry that it'd be like that 
movie 101 Dalmatians at a bunch of 

179
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:38,220
people start getting foster kids now and
screw them up?

180
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,173
Yeah,
we.

181
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,640
Well we were talking about top gun about
how,

182
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:42,474
you know,
remember when top gun came out and 

183
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:45,330
everybody joined the navy thinking they 
were going to fly the plane.

184
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,970
Well when the color of money came out,
pool halls boomed across the country.

185
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:55,590
I made a giant impact on pool halls for 
that one tom cruise movie.

186
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,483
And it's just really a lot of people 
just got scammed out of their fucking 

187
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,430
pocket money.
Some of that going on.

188
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,300
I think the crazy thing about this too 
was that like on the set,

189
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,220
you realize like when you were doing 
this,

190
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:09,450
you go like,
Oh yeah,

191
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:12,450
I always thought of people who do that.
Like you know,

192
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:13,620
they exist,
but you're like,

193
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,080
those are nameless,
faceless angels.

194
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,980
They're not real people like you or like
do any of your friends at top.

195
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:20,740
I'd be like,
Oh,

196
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,790
don't not friends like that.
Those are other people you know.

197
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,440
And then you start like on the set there
was,

198
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,603
you know,
people visiting or consulting and there 

199
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:28,981
would be like,
oh,

200
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:29,814
you know,
they adopted are they run some foster 

201
00:07:32,071 --> 00:07:32,940
care thing?
And then you're like,

202
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,730
oh this is actually something that 
people really do.

203
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,653
Well.
Even like dudes on the crew that 

204
00:07:37,441 --> 00:07:38,790
somebody would come up,
you know,

205
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,560
who's in the electrical department,
be like,

206
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,550
oh hey bro,
I got,

207
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,470
I adopted two kids by the way,
if you're like really,

208
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,260
you know,
or hey,

209
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:47,970
I got adopted when I was four years old.

210
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,040
He just would like,
once you see it now,

211
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:50,874
everywhere people are hitting me up.
Someone hit me up yesterday like my 

212
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:57,090
sister is adopting four siblings this 
week.

213
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,110
Wow.
Yeah.

214
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,293
This is nuts.
I mean like it's like something I don't 

215
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:02,610
want to.
It's almost like when your friend gets a

216
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:04,410
car and then you start seeing it 
everywhere.

217
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,553
There's exactly like that though.
We talked about that video that went 

218
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:12,954
around online of this little girl that 
realize that she's opening up a box and 

219
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:17,574
there's something in it that tells her 
that she's been adopted by these two 

220
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,620
people that are with her and it's 
really.

221
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:25,440
Yeah.
It's impossible to not cry.

222
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,303
Yeah.
I mean if you have any heart at all and 

223
00:08:27,511 --> 00:08:31,290
you watch that little girl freakout and 
it's breaks you up.

224
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,590
I think that's almost the test as far as
what you were talking about about how.

225
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,543
Because believe me,
I tested if you're a piece of shit or 

226
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,480
when you watch that,
we should show that.

227
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,060
What's your reaction to.
Oh,

228
00:08:45,061 --> 00:08:46,890
you're a piece of shit.
Sociopath.

229
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,220
Yeah.
But no,

230
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,360
I mean there that what you were just 
getting at as far as,

231
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,280
believe me,
I'm not that guy that like,

232
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:57,190
I didn't feel special or like any one of
those sort of heart of gold angels,

233
00:08:57,191 --> 00:08:58,890
you know,
we have a line that's in the movie where

234
00:08:58,891 --> 00:08:59,724
mark just says that's the kind of people
that volunteer when it's not even a 

235
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:03,840
holiday.
And we don't do that.

236
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,053
Yeah,
you should probably tell the audience 

237
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:09,330
that I'm not staring in this movie right
now for people who know those people are

238
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:10,570
like.
So Tom Starts.

239
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,610
This is Mark Wahlberg movie for like 
four and a half minutes.

240
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,070
There you go.
Mark Wahlberg.

241
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:18,390
Stars in the rest of it.
That's true.

242
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,510
That's a good way of breaking it down.
It was only probably like 90 minutes.

243
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,780
That's pretty good.

244
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,990
That's not bad.
Probably like seven scenes.

245
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,260
That's good scenes.
Now you've got a solid presence.

246
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,420
You didn't make the poster,
the poster,

247
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,480
the poster.
You made the standee though.

248
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:36,540
Did you know that there's a standee in 
movie theaters in your and that.

249
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,830
Oh really?
Alright,

250
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,280
I'll take that one.
Heard that word.

251
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,260
Standee Sandy.
Those are the big cardboard,

252
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,170
those things where I didn't know that 
either.

253
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,063
Cardboard cut out thing.
That's what I always call it cardboard 

254
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,780
cutout.
Standee is the real.

255
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,180
The real term,
is that the term in the industry?

256
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,500
So yeah,
that's an industry term.

257
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:57,420
That's a real industry term.
You learned something today.

258
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,670
Wait,
so you.

259
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,470
Because you were telling me this and I 
was like,

260
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:02,910
he was about to tell me before you came 
in.

261
00:10:02,911 --> 00:10:03,744
I was like,
this sounds like this could be pretty 

262
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:05,154
good.
Don't tell me save it for the podcast 

263
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:07,344
that because he's done this is the most 
press sean's done for a film that he's 

264
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:11,430
put out that.

265
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,900
Did you go under?
They were like,

266
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:15,690
let's give you some advice on media.
Yeah.

267
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:16,980
Well first of all,
I'm terrible at it,

268
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,823
so there's that because I don't do.
This is the thing when you direct a 

269
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:21,564
movie,
especially movies like the kind of 

270
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,710
movies that I make comedies and you 
know,

271
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,673
big broad comedies,
people don't really care who directed 

272
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:31,140
those movies and I'm good with that.
Like I'm totally good with that.

273
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:36,170
But what usually happens is the studio,
the director usually wants to be kind of

274
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,600
a part of the campaign so the studio 
will find,

275
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:40,434
they'll sort of throw bones at u of a 
press that you can do and I always tell 

276
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:43,080
them,
look,

277
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,270
if I can be helpful in any way,
let me know.

278
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:46,104
I'll do whatever you need me to do,
but don't throw many bones because I 

279
00:10:47,851 --> 00:10:48,684
don't care.
Like I don't need to do that to kind 

280
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:51,803
just pump up the ego of the director 
that certain directors just really want 

281
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:56,100
to be the next Quentin Terica.

282
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:56,963
Yeah.
I can't imagine there's some directors 

283
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,320
they really have to do it for.
I get it.

284
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,120
They don't want you to feel left out or 
whatever.

285
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,010
But by my first couple of movies I 
thought,

286
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,390
Oh,
I have to do this stuff.

287
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:07,224
And then I realized I actually had this 
experience where I was in this red 

288
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:12,900
carpet thing and they brought me up to 
this reporter and they said,

289
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,763
this is Shawn Andrews.
He directed the movie and she had this 

290
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:18,720
big look on her face.
And then she went and I was like,

291
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:19,560
Nah,
it's cool,

292
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:22,800
you don't have to.
So disappointed.

293
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,503
So disappointed.
And that's when it sunk into me where I 

294
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:27,181
was just like,
oh,

295
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:28,360
they don't care.
They don't give it.

296
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,790
So that's,
that's fine with me.

297
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:30,624
I'm good there.
Well there's such fame whores and those 

298
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,430
days are those red carpet things.
There are so weird.

299
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,350
Yeah.
Those things are so weird.

300
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:41,520
And some people that is the highlight of
their life walking the carpet.

301
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,260
I can't over here Tom.
You're posedown right?

302
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,800
It's a really weird thing.
Also pop.

303
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,650
See at the airport you have that where 
um,

304
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,543
I've seen them where I'm at,
baggage and they're looking around and 

305
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:59,740
then they're like,
hey tom.

306
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,250
And they'll ask me like,
what are things?

307
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,940
They're obviously not there for me,
but they're like,

308
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,410
they're like,
we got time till fucking whatever.

309
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,280
Seth rogen gets off the plane.
So let me ask you something.

310
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:10,200
And then they're like,
oh,

311
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:10,781
all right,
nevermind.

312
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:13,800
Here's everybody like,
just blow you off and you're like,

313
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,750
I happen only one time because this 
obviously doesn't happen to me.

314
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,633
That was flying into lax and I was 
getting off a red eye and I was so just 

315
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,500
tired.
I looked like shit and that,

316
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,653
and this guy,
these two guys come up and they just 

317
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:26,950
were so nice.
They were like,

318
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:28,030
Hey,
you're Shawn Andrews.

319
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,230
Right?
And I was like,

320
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,130
yeah,
yes I am on editors.

321
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,110
They nobody ever,
you know,

322
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,183
and so it takes me a second to realize 
and I thought it was so weird because 

323
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,180
they were,
it was right after,

324
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:38,014
it was shortly after daddy's home and 
that was like the biggest hit and they 

325
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:42,610
were asking me about horrible bosses too
and I was like,

326
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:44,580
why are they asking me about,
of all things.

327
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,401
And I thought,
oh,

328
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:46,234
because Jennifer Aniston's in it.
So they want me to say something about 

329
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:50,014
Jennifer Aniston and just see if they 
can catch me saying something crazy and 

330
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,380
looking for a soundbite slip or 
something they're trying to do.

331
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,930
Yeah,
it's weird.

332
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,760
And my wife is like,
what was that?

333
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:01,594
I'm like,
I,

334
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,443
I.
It took me an hour to sort of trying to 

335
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:05,030
make you click bait.
It's not.

336
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,473
Well,
what's interesting too is it's sort of 

337
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:11,070
an impromptu interview that you have to 
do,

338
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,540
right?
Like if someone said,

339
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,130
hey,
this guy's name is Mike,

340
00:13:14,131 --> 00:13:14,964
he lives in studio city,
wants you to go to his house and he's 

341
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,510
gonna film you,
he's going to ask you a wacky questions.

342
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,344
He was like,
no,

343
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:26,310
but if Mike shows up at the baggage 
claim and puts a camera in your face,

344
00:13:26,311 --> 00:13:28,040
hey sean,
Jennifer Anniston,

345
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,190
man,
what's up with the Botox?

346
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,950
You're like,
what the fuck?

347
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,430
You know what I mean?
That's how they get.

348
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,323
Like,
you wouldn't do an interview with them 

349
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:38,390
under any other circumstances,
which is one of like,

350
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,280
one of the weird things that happened 
during the Roseanne Barr things.

351
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:45,090
Roseanne Barr when her show was canceled
and all the controversy was going on.

352
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,880
She was supposed to do the podcast and 
it became a big news thing,

353
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,110
but because she put it on her,
uh,

354
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,050
her twitter that I'm going to do it.

355
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:56,280
And we talked about it and then they 
tried to show up at the podcast studio.

356
00:13:56,281 --> 00:14:00,990
So they had all these news people 
standing outside the podcast studio with

357
00:14:00,991 --> 00:14:01,824
their microphones were out out in front 
of where Joe Rogan does his podcast and 

358
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,940
they thought for some reason just 
because they're there,

359
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,820
people have to talk to them.
I'm here,

360
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,520
talk to me.
The,

361
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,390
the,
they're made out of milk.

362
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,343
They're barely human.
The way they talk is the most boring 

363
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,510
version of an interview you'd ever get 
ever.

364
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,653
It's a tiny,
quick little soundbite where they feel 

365
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:25,291
like,
because they're,

366
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,850
they're like,
the camera's on,

367
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,580
I've got the microphone.
Come on,

368
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,150
do it.
If they said,

369
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:31,230
hey,
you know,

370
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,283
kw,
fuck yourself once you to come in and 

371
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:35,700
sit down for an interview,
you'd be like,

372
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:36,590
no,
I don't want to.

373
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,090
I don't want to talk to them.
I don't have anything to say.

374
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,730
Like I'll do all my talking on the 
podcast.

375
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,983
But.

376
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,460
Well,
but,

377
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,460
and also if you're,
I mean I'm in the business,

378
00:14:46,461 --> 00:14:47,294
but again,
I'm not somebody that does a tremendous 

379
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:51,680
amount of press or at least not until a 
couple weeks ago.

380
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,200
Um,
and if you're not accustomed to that,

381
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,063
it's terrifying.
It's weird because somebody puts a 

382
00:14:56,691 --> 00:14:58,480
camera in your face because immediately 
you're thinking like,

383
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,211
well,
if I just go,

384
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:00,170
you know what man?
Fuck you.

385
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:01,630
Like I don't have time for that.
Yeah.

386
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,080
Then you're going to.
So you just think like,

387
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:03,914
I can't even walk away from this.
So you just feel like you're all of a 

388
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:09,080
sudden somebody throw a cage over you.
They're not even asking you,

389
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,090
can I do this?
They're just doing it.

390
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,950
They're just,
hey shawn.

391
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,040
Yeah.
Let me ask you a question,

392
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,330
Shawn.
It's forced.

393
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,350
It's forced on you.
It puts you in a weird spot.

394
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,600
It's like all the sudden you're in your.
You're on your,

395
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,523
on your heels,
because your instinct is to be 

396
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:23,920
defensive.
If someone could say you're.

397
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,730
You know what I mean?
Your instinct is not going to be.

398
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,490
I'll give the most thoughtful answer to 
this because it's,

399
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,920
it's,
it's in the moment.

400
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:33,110
Someone just dropped it on you,
so now you're like,

401
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,121
okay,
and,

402
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:34,954
and your,
your emotions might be kind of all over 

403
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:39,580
the place and you're not,
you're not stopping to like,

404
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,513
like having a conversation.
You're just sort of trying to figure 

405
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:43,874
your way out of it and how many people 
have ruined their careers or lives on 

406
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:50,890
those things just said,
just fucked up and said one,

407
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,480
they're just trying to be funny or just 
that's the thing,

408
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:56,300
because they'll miss mutated and then 
they get ya,

409
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,860
and then they put it up and you're like,
fuck,

410
00:15:57,861 --> 00:16:00,650
why did I think through that?
I was coming home from the airport.

411
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:01,820
I was tired.
I was jet lagged.

412
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,043
Bordain got a shitload of death threats 
because he said they asked him if you 

413
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:10,670
had to serve dinner to Kim Jong Un and 
Donald trump,

414
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:11,330
what would you serve?

415
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,970
You said Hemlock,
it's trying to be funny,

416
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:19,420
and then you all these mega fucking 
morons protestors were there.

417
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:22,700
They were all sending these tweets like 
Potus,

418
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,663
you know,
he's threatening potus and it was so 

419
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:27,350
strange.
Like,

420
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,700
where,
where is the NFL?

421
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:30,350
You know,
where's the secret service?

422
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,930
They should lock this motherfucker up 
and like,

423
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,720
you guys are crazy.
It's a joke.

424
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,600
And that's the thing right there is that
click bait articles are they all make it

425
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,443
so it'll say like so and so said this 
and they make it sound like somebody 

426
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:44,510
like called a press conference to say 
something ridiculous.

427
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:45,763
And really it was like you said,
it'll be some offhand remark and then 

428
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,360
people out there that are judging,
they,

429
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,243
they,
they never have anybody walk up and put 

430
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:54,980
a camera in their face and they just 
think,

431
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:56,210
well I would never say anything like 
that.

432
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,530
It's like you don't know what you would 
say.

433
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,900
You're never in that situation.
It's bizarre.

434
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,500
It's very bizarre.
Bizarre.

435
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,840
So how many of these things did you have
to do to promote this film?

436
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:06,674
Because it,
because of this film was based in large 

437
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:11,144
part of it.
On your actual life experiences of 

438
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:15,530
adopting these kids.
How many of these things did you have to

439
00:17:15,531 --> 00:17:19,370
wind up doing a lot?
Because I did,

440
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,443
we did our press junket in New York and 
I've done junkets and usually I do like 

441
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,360
six or seven or 15 or whatever I did in 
two days.

442
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:27,194
I did like 90,
95 sort of the same questions keep 

443
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:30,344
coming back to over and over again.
You start developing these canned 

444
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,900
responses.
That's the thing you have to,

445
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,060
and this is a mistake and this gets back
to what you were getting at before,

446
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:41,780
is that when I would do press on my 
movies in the past,

447
00:17:41,781 --> 00:17:42,614
I'd go to the junket and people would 
come in and they didn't ask you more or 

448
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,374
less the same questions.
And I always felt weird because I just 

449
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:47,781
felt like,
no,

450
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:49,260
I just want to have a conversation with 
you.

451
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:50,100
I don't want to be like

452
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,933
this disingenuous guy.
And then I would be sort of changing up 

453
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:54,684
my answers and trying to kind of just 
essentially just made it boring and I 

454
00:17:57,961 --> 00:18:00,090
wasn't really making any kind of a point
whatsoever.

455
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,600
So,
uh,

456
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,330
on this one they were like,
look,

457
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:04,164
you've got a message with this movie.
You've got things you want to get out 

458
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:08,010
with this movie.
You've got to learn how to do this.

459
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,233
So I went,
I went to like a day of media training 

460
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:15,110
and it was,
I did,

461
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,133
I did.
And it was the worst part was I've done 

462
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,183
interviews and I've been fine before,
but I got this guy sitting across from 

463
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:24,294
me who's,
who's interviewing me doing this mock 

464
00:18:26,161 --> 00:18:26,994
interview and then I've got the 
publicist and my writing partner and 

465
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:30,870
they're just staring at me and that will
listen.

466
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:31,910
I can't do it.
Right.

467
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,120
All the pressures there.

468
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,970
Who's teaching you?
Who's teaching this training?

469
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,160
Where they right away?
Like,

470
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,630
you kinda suck at this.
Yeah,

471
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,720
absolutely.
I mean they were really nice about it.

472
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,670
They were like,
okay,

473
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,840
well there's some,
there's some room for improvement.

474
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,400
Oh my God.
Really?

475
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,170
Oh yeah.
No,

476
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,270
it was the worst.
It will seem like a natural.

477
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:53,220
I mean there's what,
what is there to teach you?

478
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,680
Well now what?
Well this,

479
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,360
this is the thing that I'm really 
comfortable with this with,

480
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,213
with us just hanging out here talking.
But this is what I do is I yammer when 

481
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,330
I'm,
I'm a nervous talker.

482
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:05,400
So you asked me a question if I'm 
nervous,

483
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:07,260
I just kind of go and go and go.
And people are like,

484
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:12,290
Geez us man,
that guy talk.

485
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,190
So the thing is,
I got this guy sent across me,

486
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,710
really nice guy and he's The guy who's 
coaching me,

487
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,820
but I know I'm going to give you like 
fake interviews.

488
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,160
Well,
he'd have a coach you first he gave me.

489
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,053
He gave me a lot of really good insights
and the funny thing is every rule that 

490
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:32,250
he's saying as he's saying it,
I'm going,

491
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,113
Oh yeah,
I do that.

492
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,013
Oh yeah,
like everything he's saying that I 

493
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:35,790
shouldn't be doing.
I'm like,

494
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,421
oh yeah,
that's.

495
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:37,254
I always do.
What is he saying you shouldn't be 

496
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:40,980
doing?
I mean that the main thing,

497
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:41,814
it's Kinda like what we were getting at 
before that when somebody is setting a 

498
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:44,754
trap for you,
because so much of right now media 

499
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:47,604
training is just about don't go out and 
get yourself into trouble by going in 

500
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,630
and just talking about some ridiculous 
area that.

501
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,473
Because that's what people,
that's what everybody's trying to do 

502
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:57,120
now.
Like just as a.

503
00:19:57,121 --> 00:19:57,954
for example,
I did a Time magazine interview about 

504
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,330
adoption about a year before we even 
made the movie.

505
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,313
Really?
Yeah.

506
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,710
And it was just because,
uh,

507
00:20:05,711 --> 00:20:08,910
I was in the process of working on the 
movie and anyway,

508
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,940
so the whole thing was just about 
adoption in my family and whatever.

509
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:14,370
And it was right when the Harvey 
Weinstein stuff was blowing up.

510
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,970
So the lady's really nice interviewing 
you.

511
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,140
And then at the end she says,
uh,

512
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,190
hey,
you know,

513
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,930
since I'm talking to a Hollywood 
director,

514
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:25,590
I'd be remiss if I didn't ask did you 
know about that Harvey Weinstein stuff?

515
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,350
And I was like,
Nah.

516
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,520
And I didn't even think about my answer 
because I don't know,

517
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,060
I didn't know the guy was never around 
any of it.

518
00:20:33,061 --> 00:20:34,770
That's sort of like more like fancy 
movies.

519
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,820
And I was like,
yeah,

520
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,380
know I don't,
I don't know,

521
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,580
I never met the guy,
whatever.

522
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,160
I didn't think anything of it.
I got off the phone and then I thought,

523
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,450
oh,
she didn't say,

524
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:44,190
what do you think about this stuff?
She said,

525
00:20:44,191 --> 00:20:47,710
did you know about that stuff?
And it was like,

526
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,581
and yeah,
I knew,

527
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,580
but I kept it a secret fuck those 
people.

528
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,110
And I just thought right away,
I,

529
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,210
I just,
you know,

530
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,740
so yeah,
it's,

531
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:57,521
it's,
it's sneaky.

532
00:20:57,521 --> 00:21:00,850
That's a sneaky way of asking to sneaky 
way to get you to,

533
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,190
you know.
Yeah.

534
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,690
Yeah.
Did you know what,

535
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:07,240
if you don't enter his kept his secret 
for years.

536
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,610
I'm such a dumb shit.
I would have,

537
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,863
like you said before,
I think I think a year or two ago I 

538
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:15,070
might have made a joke,
you know,

539
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:15,910
and been like,
oh yeah,

540
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:17,040
I was there,
you know,

541
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,460
and just printing.

542
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,590
Yeah.
Was there.

543
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,103
And then I'd be like,
what,

544
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,590
you know.
So uh,

545
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,503
so you know,
a lot of it is just just to kind of 

546
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,340
teach you how to just sort of stay on 
point so that you don't get dragged down

547
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:32,920
these weird roads into these things that
just,

548
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,380
that people are looking to get you in on
clickbait.

549
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,680
So did you bring up that instance when 
you went through the training?

550
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,750
Oh yeah.
Did you say what should I have said?

551
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,390
I think I did.
I think and,

552
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,150
and really what they,
what they teach you.

553
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,870
It was funny because believe it or not,
he said,

554
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,290
I'm going to show you some clips of,
you know,

555
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,950
sort of doing it right and doing it 
wrong.

556
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,240
Oh,
they have disaster clips.

557
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:53,074
They say they do and one of them the 
file that you sent to Jim before the 

558
00:21:56,561 --> 00:21:58,210
show,
but you guys will probably all know this

559
00:21:58,211 --> 00:21:59,044
one,
they showed me a clip of Quentin 

560
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,353
Tarantino,
sort of like getting really angry with 

561
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,970
this reporter.

562
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,163
Was that the violent thing?
I thought it was kind of to kick some 

563
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:12,280
guys asked that lady was like,
your films are disgusting and violent.

564
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:13,150
And he was like,
yeah,

565
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,390
they're fucking movies dummy.
Like he gets really upset about it.

566
00:22:16,391 --> 00:22:18,730
And where was this?
Actually I ref it's the same one because

567
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:20,220
the one that I saw was a guy.
Oh,

568
00:22:20,221 --> 00:22:22,060
I saw him with a lady.
Uh,

569
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,770
but that was via sat,
like,

570
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,013
so this is a different one.
Then there was one where the guy was 

571
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,630
threatening to kick the guy's ass.
I don't.

572
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,790
The one that I saw didn't go that far,
but what?

573
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,490
I actually kinda liked what he said 
because he was like,

574
00:22:33,491 --> 00:22:35,260
no,
I'm not playing that game with you.

575
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,750
I'm not doing any.
Got Off.

576
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,360
But I was sort of like,
Eh,

577
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,830
you know,
I liked that he does that.

578
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,030
I mean I,
I liked the one with the lady.

579
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:45,550
The lady is like,
your movies are so violent and awful,

580
00:22:45,551 --> 00:22:48,010
and he was like a movie a make believe 
thing.

581
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,173
It's not real violence.
Like he really sas or it's funny as 

582
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:52,730
shit.
And then I also,

583
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,800
she,
where was she?

584
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,690
She was doing,
you know,

585
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,770
she was,
she was like,

586
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,670
good morning Pittsburgh,
like the entertainment reporter and then

587
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:01,504
he was actually probably doing like 
satellite stuff everywhere and he was 

588
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:05,410
just like,
you're dumb.

589
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,080
But I also saw there's that guy,
he's a Gotcha guy too.

590
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:14,620
Did a Robert Downey Jr.
It was promoting a movie too.

591
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:15,670
I don't know if they showed you that 
one.

592
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,270
Oh,
that one.

593
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,103
Right.
And the guy said,

594
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,150
now your drug addiction.
He was like,

595
00:23:19,151 --> 00:23:19,984
wait,
what?

596
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:24,040
It was totally to try to get him to in a
moment,

597
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,390
robert downey jr is not having it.
He's like,

598
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,870
I'm here to promote a movie.
Yeah.

599
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,610
Um,
this has nothing to do with that.

600
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,650
Totally.
But let's,

601
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,300
let's get into your drug addiction 
during your darkest times.

602
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:38,290
Like,
what are you talking about?

603
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,280
Man?
Iron mans out.

604
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,350
I'm not doing my hair for that.
Well,

605
00:23:41,351 --> 00:23:43,660
it's just like the ends it too.
They're so selfish.

606
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:46,610
Like that thing is so doing shit like 
that is so selfish.

607
00:23:46,611 --> 00:23:49,190
It's such a sneaky little thing to do.
Yeah.

608
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,460
What did they teach you though?

609
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,670
Like in that moment of like when they're
just like,

610
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:53,930
don't,
don't get emotional.

611
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,830
It's like don't take the bait and,
and more than anything for me,

612
00:23:57,831 --> 00:24:01,250
because I look,
I'm from Wisconsin and I still have that

613
00:24:01,251 --> 00:24:02,660
kind of.
everybody's nice.

614
00:24:02,661 --> 00:24:05,330
Everybody has good intentions to five,
you know,

615
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,433
so,
and I had this experience on my very 

616
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:12,140
first movie where I,
I talked to this reporter because it was

617
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:13,820
a movie about a,
it was a road trip,

618
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:14,161
you know,
this,

619
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,100
this silly road trip comedy,
you know,

620
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,080
and I talked to this reporter and he 
says,

621
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,360
and he was just being,
he was being really cool.

622
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:23,560
We were just kInda hanging out after 
this thing talking and he's like sit and

623
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,470
gas prices were really high and he goes,
so,

624
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,700
uh,
he's like,

625
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,620
you feel weird about making a road trip 
movie when gas prices are so high.

626
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,473
And I,
and I said,

627
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,281
eh,
I don't know,

628
00:24:32,281 --> 00:24:32,620
I,
I,

629
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,453
you know,
maybe if the movie tanks I can just 

630
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:35,084
blame it on that no one could afford to 
go to the theater because the prices 

631
00:24:37,161 --> 00:24:37,994
were so high and I don't think.
And then this article comes out that 

632
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:44,270
just the guy literally said I was 
swarthy looking and it just,

633
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,810
he just painted me like an absolute 
piece of shit and I was like,

634
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,823
that guy was so cool.
Like he was like when we were talking 

635
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:54,500
and then he just destroyed me.
I've been there.

636
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,890
Yeah,
I'm sure you guys have.

637
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,680
Yeah,
it's all new to me.

638
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,870
I remember one too that like,
who did it to me,

639
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,953
like when I was just doing phone,
like a phone interview for press before 

640
00:25:05,391 --> 00:25:06,224
I was selling any tickets and the guy 
was just like a really nice guy and 

641
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:12,110
totally twisted things.

642
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,730
And made it seem like,
just like he knOws what I was saying and

643
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:21,080
he purposely twisted things around and 
then it had no impact,

644
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:22,370
but I remember reading that and being 
like,

645
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,450
oh fuck this guy.
And,

646
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:29,210
and be careful when you talk to these 
people because he totally,

647
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,290
he knows what I was trying to say and I 
read this article.

648
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:34,220
It's like he misRepresented everything.
Yeah.

649
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,500
Well that's the only way they can have 
fun.

650
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,733
And that's the only.
I mean if you're just a normal guy and 

651
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:40,490
you give a,
you know,

652
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:43,760
normal answers and you're thoughtful and
considerate,

653
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,610
that's not as good for them.
Right.

654
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,140
It's so twisted around,
well it's not just,

655
00:25:48,141 --> 00:25:50,900
it's not as profitable.
It's more profitable.

656
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,600
And especially if it's an online thing 
with an online thing,

657
00:25:53,601 --> 00:25:54,434
you need to click bait title.
You need a bunch of people clicking on 

658
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:58,460
that thing because otherwise you're not 
going to get any ad revenue for it.

659
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,373
Yes.
It's a very bizarre model where it's 

660
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:07,190
encouraging people to be deceptive and 
to make these things inflammatory.

661
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,660
And I got to say,
look,

662
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,620
I did,
like I said,

663
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:10,454
I did 90,
95 interviews and in the course of two 

664
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:16,370
days and virtually everybody was really 
cool,

665
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:19,190
really asking really thoughtful,
interesting question.

666
00:26:19,191 --> 00:26:20,024
So I don't want to make it sound like 
I'm ripping on tHe whole press over 

667
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:22,521
this.
But yeah,

668
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:23,354
there are these people.
And that's the thing is that if it was 

669
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:26,144
every single person that came along,
it would almost be easier because you 

670
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:29,570
could just kind of be like,
okay,

671
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,950
here we go.
I got it.

672
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,230
But you,
but you get like 30,

673
00:26:33,231 --> 00:26:34,710
really good,
you know,

674
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,490
reporters with integrity and good 
people.

675
00:26:37,491 --> 00:26:39,410
And then somebody jumps in and you're 
like,

676
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,470
oh,
and then then,

677
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:43,200
then they catch you not looking because 
you're not looking for that guy there.

678
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:43,980
Also get super

679
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,330
jaded.
You know,

680
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:47,610
it's almost like cops that have arrested
too many people.

681
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:50,130
Everyone's a crook.
Like they just think that everybody that

682
00:26:50,131 --> 00:26:50,964
we're interviewing is a piece of shit.
And it's also like they're interviewing 

683
00:26:53,671 --> 00:26:55,500
these hollywood people.
They're thinking of you,

684
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:57,690
you had a big mansion and driving a 
mercedes.

685
00:26:57,691 --> 00:26:59,100
You've got all this money.
Fuck this guy,

686
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,950
it's like this instant take on it.
Oh,

687
00:27:01,951 --> 00:27:03,640
a hollywood director.
Yeah.

688
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,280
Right.
How's your casting couch?

689
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,173
Yeah.
ShIt.

690
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,440
Yeah,
that's true.

691
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,420
It's true.
And it becomes the game.

692
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:11,340
I think too,
for them the game is like,

693
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,460
let's see if I can get one and we should
be really clear.

694
00:27:14,461 --> 00:27:16,050
This is not.
Most people,

695
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,170
most people are nice,
but it's just like one.

696
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,690
Even if it's only one out of 10,
you run into that one.

697
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:22,950
you're like,
fuck these things.

698
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:24,180
I don't want to do those things anymore.

699
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,570
totally terrifying because you think 
about your family,

700
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:28,404
your friends,
like anybody who's going to cause now 

701
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:31,290
there,
there is this.

702
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:32,723
I know you guys talked about this a lot.
There is this culture out there where 

703
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,203
people are completely reduced to like 
one moment or one statement or whatever 

704
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:41,274
it is and that's all you are.
Is that whatever that thing that 

705
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,050
happened in that one moment and you 
know,

706
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,880
you see it happening to people all the 
time and you think about so.

707
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:52,620
So when you'Re there and you feel like 
you're just a regular guy,

708
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:53,454
you don't feel like you know that it's 
really scary because you think about 

709
00:27:56,071 --> 00:27:57,410
your kids and you think of it,
you know,

710
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,220
so it's a,
it's a scary situation.

711
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

712
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:04,530
Well,
it's a weirD time for these publications

713
00:28:04,531 --> 00:28:05,364
to be taken in consideration.
No one's really buying magazines and 

714
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,180
newspapers like they used to.

715
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,013
It's hard to sell and so they're reduced
to these online publications and they 

716
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:17,664
have to compete with a bunch of these 
click baity bullshit things and that's 

717
00:28:21,271 --> 00:28:22,170
where the money is.
I mean,

718
00:28:22,171 --> 00:28:23,580
even in New York times,
man,

719
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:26,790
the New York times is resulting to a lot
of click baity shit now.

720
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:27,720
And you're like,
wow,

721
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:28,763
well do you guys have that feeling?
Like when you're online that you're on 

722
00:28:31,051 --> 00:28:33,750
liquor clickbait diet where you see 
things where you're like,

723
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,730
oh man,
I totally want to eat that right now,

724
00:28:35,731 --> 00:28:36,564
but I'm not.
I'm not gonna do that ingredient in a 

725
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:45,210
box.
So sweet to navigate it.

726
00:28:45,211 --> 00:28:49,710
Now you read that title and you're like,
I know this will have no substance.

727
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,403
just the headline,
I'm fascinated to see where this goes 

728
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:55,170
because this didn't exist,
right?

729
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,263
These online click baity things didn't 
exist 20 years ago and now they're 

730
00:28:59,161 --> 00:28:59,830
everywhere.

731
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,070
it's like what?
What's gonna happen in 10 years?

732
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:03,270
Like,
where's it going to be like,

733
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,730
where's this going?
Yeah.

734
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,270
I'm very fascinated,
you know,

735
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,930
very,
very fascinated to see.

736
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,783
It feels like a transitional time.
It doesn't feel like it can Hold out 

737
00:29:11,161 --> 00:29:12,570
like this forever.
That's true.

738
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,430
Yeah.
Yeah,

739
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,790
I agree.
Because it hurts.

740
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,673
I mean,
and this is,

741
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:20,750
this is the reason why I think podcasts,
culture is coming on strong because it's

742
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:21,714
a place where people just talk and have 
a conversation and I think that fear of 

743
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:26,454
slipping up and people always out there 
trying to get you to slip up or 

744
00:29:29,521 --> 00:29:30,354
whatever,
has people not havIng as much of a free 

745
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:35,940
exchange of ideas,
but through these podcasts,

746
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:36,774
one thing that does happen is people 
will take a very small clip out of 

747
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,194
context and then write a whole article 
about that small clip with a big click 

748
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:45,484
baity headline like thompson sigora 
shits all over people in Somalia and 

749
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,070
then you know,
whatever it is,

750
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:51,870
and then do that.

751
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,190
No,
I mean it was a different city.

752
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,560
I just made something up.
But then you know,

753
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:02,580
it could be completely out of context 
and over a giant overall discussion of a

754
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,363
top of a topic that took place over 45 
minutes and they'll take 30 seconds of 

755
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:13,710
that and put a youtube clip up and then 
you get a bunch of angry people at you.

756
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:14,703
That's true.
But the other flip side of it is that I 

757
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:17,734
feel like in this time we're developing 
more of an audience that is quick to 

758
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:23,524
call that shit out.
So while there are going to be people 

759
00:30:25,451 --> 00:30:27,200
that take the bait and be like,
what is it?

760
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,063
Get angry.
There's a bunch of people who are like 

761
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,430
really quick to recognize that that's 
taken out of context.

762
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,710
Well,
it's because people like you and I and a

763
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:38,980
lot of other people that do podcasts 
talk about that all the time.

764
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,710
So people hear it all the time,
they see the examples of it and you go,

765
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:42,940
wow,
that's crazy.

766
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,060
Some of it is so egregious.
You're like,

767
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,630
yeah,
you're a piece of shit.

768
00:30:46,631 --> 00:30:49,570
Like someone should pull your license.
Like if you were a doctor,

769
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:52,620
they'd fully pull your fucking license 
as a journalist.

770
00:30:52,621 --> 00:30:55,420
He was a lot of wiggle room with p and a
piece of shit.

771
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,700
Yeah,
yeah,

772
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,380
yeah.
But these are journalists,

773
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,300
air quotes,
these podcasts.

774
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,163
This,
this medium is just going to grow and 

775
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:08,670
people are embracing more this long form
conversation and understanding things by

776
00:31:10,061 --> 00:31:11,680
talking about it for awhile.
Well,

777
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:15,520
and the other part of it that I think 
that gets lost sometimes is that,

778
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,753
You know,
like right now we're talking about like 

779
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:18,544
journalists,
but the great journalists are just as 

780
00:31:21,101 --> 00:31:21,934
hurt by this.
This stUff is everyone because the 

781
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:26,440
people that are really out there being 
thoughtful,

782
00:31:26,441 --> 00:31:29,410
really researching their material,
really talking to people,

783
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:30,820
getting to the bottom of things.

784
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,630
That whole journalistic work ethic that 
we all grew up hearing about.

785
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:35,723
The,
those people are just as threatened by 

786
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:38,194
this cheap,
the sort of attack journalism that 

787
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:42,280
happens because they can't even compete 
with it,

788
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,080
with a,
with a really thoughtful,

789
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,470
well researched story.
And then somebody like he touched a boob

790
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:49,330
and then there's like the,
they get all the clicks.

791
00:31:49,331 --> 00:31:50,164
You know,
I was talking to matt taibbi who's a 

792
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:53,194
real journalist and matt taibbi was 
discussing the pieces that he wrote on 

793
00:31:56,711 --> 00:31:58,840
wall street and uh,
the,

794
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,683
uh,
the crash of 2008 and all the fucking 

795
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:07,801
shenanigans that went on with that and 
how much just crazy shit they're allowed

796
00:32:08,231 --> 00:32:10,780
to do and what they can,
what a ponzi scheme.

797
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:15,700
A loT of that 2008 crash was.
And you went,

798
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:16,534
I was talking to him,
I realized he had put a year into 

799
00:32:20,081 --> 00:32:25,081
research learning like he did not come 
from a background in finance,

800
00:32:25,181 --> 00:32:26,014
so he put a year into researching all 
the aspects of the savings and loan 

801
00:32:29,921 --> 00:32:30,754
crisis,
all the aspects of the mortgage crisis 

802
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:35,434
and how it took place and how they were,
how they were making money off of this 

803
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,823
and how they were betting on things 
falling apart and moving money around 

804
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:47,000
and how fucking chaotic it is and how 
crazy it is.

805
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,953
And then you think of how much time put 
on that and then in proportion how few 

806
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:56,531
people actually read that and how little
it affected the actual economy itself.

807
00:32:56,811 --> 00:33:00,890
Like how little things changed and how 
little people were outraged.

808
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,833
Like his article,
I don't know if you ever read the 

809
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:05,510
rolling stone piece on it.
Fucking amazing,

810
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,380
But you don't work on that for forever.
Yeah,

811
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,980
but you don't care that much about it.
You know what I mean?

812
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:15,020
It's like those people never went to 
jail.

813
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,980
The billions of dollars just just 
disappeared.

814
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:24,930
It all got moved around and everybody,
abracadabra and they moved the cape data

815
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:26,743
and then it moves on and you know,
and he details it in this amazing way 

816
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:32,870
and you realize like,
wow,

817
00:33:32,871 --> 00:33:33,704
how many of those guys are left?
How many of those real journalists or 

818
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,360
are left?
Right.

819
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,090
And this is a,
I mean it,

820
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,560
you have to invest in something like 
that.

821
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,423
I mean,
he's putting a year into just 

822
00:33:44,511 --> 00:33:47,480
researching what this is all about.
Yeah,

823
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,830
it's fucking insane.
I mean,

824
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,670
and then instead,
you know,

825
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,200
it's like a kim kardashian got her butt 
done again,

826
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,370
boom,
boom.

827
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,410
50 times more.
People are paying attention to that,

828
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:57,861
that.
Well,

829
00:33:57,861 --> 00:34:00,140
let me ask you this because I think in a
weird way,

830
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,123
this weird time that we're in right now 
could actually be the rebirth of that 

831
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:10,070
kind of journalism that you're talking 
about because I know that that when,

832
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,250
when everything was getting kind of 
crazy and people were,

833
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,990
you know,
were talking about all this.

834
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,930
I did a subscribe to some,
you know,

835
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,300
like the online version of some papers 
because I thought,

836
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,143
oh,
I do want to support people that are 

837
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:25,230
actually,
you know,

838
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,280
people with integrity that are out there
chasing stories,

839
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,230
do the,
informing the world,

840
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:31,370
you know,
and helping us out.

841
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,620
Also they fuck you over if you don't do 
it,

842
00:34:33,621 --> 00:34:37,370
you can't read like 10 New York times 
article and they cut you off.

843
00:34:37,371 --> 00:34:37,821
Like,
oh,

844
00:34:37,821 --> 00:34:39,340
you know,
you have to subscribe.

845
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,140
Yeah.
Good for you though.

846
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,300
You know what I mean?
It kind of have to.

847
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:49,670
I wish it was a little easier to do 
though is set it up with apple one click

848
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:50,590
or some shit,
you know,

849
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,190
I think it is now.
Yeah.

850
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,900
It's kind of a pain.
I don't get that.

851
00:34:53,901 --> 00:34:58,760
Why I subscribe to a few of them and if 
I go to the app,

852
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,623
obviously everything's fine,
but if I try to read it through another 

853
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:02,181
link,
it's like,

854
00:35:02,181 --> 00:35:04,240
ah,
you already subscribed.

855
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,303
Know it's kind of annoying because then 
you got to jump into the app and then 

856
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:09,350
find the story again.
And it's annoying.

857
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,533
But I get it.
I mean they have to figure out some way 

858
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,623
to generate a revenue and this whole,
these last two years have been huge for 

859
00:35:19,671 --> 00:35:23,210
the subscriptions on those.
I mean Like grown by millions,

860
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:23,930
you know,
as,

861
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:24,763
as print paper has gone down,
those online subscriptions have gone 

862
00:35:28,071 --> 00:35:28,910
way,
way up.

863
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,930
really?
oh yeah,

864
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,820
yeah.
That's what they're profitable.

865
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,470
Definitely.
Definitely.

866
00:35:33,471 --> 00:35:38,120
I mean I just saw that whoever the 
editor in chief of a New York times

867
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,973
doing an art,
an interview about their recent 

868
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:43,020
subscription model,
it was impressive.

869
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:46,800
I mean really went high.
Well if you do good work,

870
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:49,950
and I mean there's people out there that
have a hunger for asheville,

871
00:35:49,951 --> 00:35:53,490
real journalism and also in depth 
intelligent,

872
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:57,960
comprehensive understandings of what is 
happening.

873
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,760
Like the real,
real,

874
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,403
a well researched take on a particular 
situation when somebody does it like 

875
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:08,640
that guy did about like the subprime 
mortgage,

876
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,053
you know,
and they spent all that time and they 

877
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,000
write that story.
I mean it's like reading a good book.

878
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,560
I just can't stop reading.
I mean,

879
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,160
did you read that dirty john story in 
the la times?

880
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,610
What does that Man,
and now they're making a,

881
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,450
they have like a mini series coming out 
about it.

882
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:25,284
I remember reading it and not being able
to stop reading it and it was like an 

883
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,673
eight part series in the la times about 
this guy who was a sociopath who would 

884
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:40,580
go on dating sites and basically bait 
women who were like divorcees,

885
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:43,943
who had some money.

886
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,873
He was posturing as a doctor and he 
would pretend to have this really 

887
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:54,291
successful life and just be a pariah 
that would like suck onto these people.

888
00:36:54,811 --> 00:36:59,811
And this story went really deep about 
how this guy found this woman.

889
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:04,590
Her daughters were like grown daughters 
immediately suspected things were wrong.

890
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,340
She didn't see it,
but the story unravels the way,

891
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,190
like a good book or like a thriller 
would,

892
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,290
you know,
would unravel and in the theater.

893
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,360
So you're just like,
like the guy,

894
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:16,500
you know,
he researched it,

895
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:17,334
I forget his name,
they turned it into a podcast and then 

896
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:21,960
now it's coming out as a,
like a short series.

897
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,010
That's the guy.
That's the guy,

898
00:37:23,011 --> 00:37:24,420
that's the real guy.
Wow.

899
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,673
Christopher gafford and men.
So it would be like part one in the 

900
00:37:28,901 --> 00:37:30,930
series,
you'd read this and you're like,

901
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:31,740
all right,
worst part.

902
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,750
Like you're like scrambling to read the 
next.

903
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,510
That's freaking me out because he's 
moving images,

904
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,530
moving slowly,
slowly pulling away.

905
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,473
Real guy.
It's a fascinating read and I recommend 

906
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,460
reading it,
man.

907
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,323
I mean it is really good.
So was this guy a career criminal 

908
00:37:49,471 --> 00:37:50,304
criminal?
He was a career crIminal that hit it 

909
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,650
well,
but um,

910
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,120
you know,
it's interesting.

911
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:00,390
I remember reading it and you're kind of
fascinated how the daughters know,

912
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,030
like they just know they keep going back
to like,

913
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:03,864
this doesn't add up,
but she's kind of lost in the love and 

914
00:38:06,211 --> 00:38:07,044
attention and exciteMent and this 
relationship and he's just praying on 

915
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,520
it.
He Is preying on her.

916
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,400
He empties her account.
I didn't want to give it away,

917
00:38:14,401 --> 00:38:15,510
man.
It's so good.

918
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:16,970
It's so good.
Yeah,

919
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,130
you can get it right now.
You just.

920
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,410
Do you have a subscription or did you 
like it's a podcast,

921
00:38:22,411 --> 00:38:26,130
a bunch of articles about how big it got
released and podcasts and la times.

922
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:28,760
There's all sorts of stories about it.
Well,

923
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:29,663
there's still,
I mean for all the people that are into 

924
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:35,560
just short attention span,
clickbait nonsense,

925
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,423
there's still

926
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,020
and there's some sort of a market for,
for real,

927
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:41,854
it's actually real real stories and real
partners and I would say that that's 

928
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:48,490
what most of it is out there.
It's just that we get the so much of.

929
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,520
I mean there's such a stock pile of that
stuff every day,

930
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:54,010
but when it comes to the actual stories 
that you're reading,

931
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,710
I don't know,
maybe I'm pollyanna about it,

932
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:59,080
but I feel like there's.
There's a lot of great stuff out there.

933
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,270
I think there's,
there's plenty of great stuff.

934
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,133
Can you think about the actual amount of
content versus hoW much time you 

935
00:39:04,631 --> 00:39:06,610
actually have to read?
There is great stuff,

936
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,500
but if you looked at the overwhelming 
appetite that people have for media,

937
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:12,603
it's for nonsense.
Like I was watching the wendy williams 

938
00:39:15,581 --> 00:39:18,340
show.
I've never watched that show before.

939
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,260
She's christ.
I of watching that show.

940
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,213
First of all,
there was a girl in the audience that 

941
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:23,650
had a crown on.
It was hilarious.

942
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,710
The audience alone,
like he should have won.

943
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,260
We should married herself.
She wasn't done.

944
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:32,583
Tom and I were at a restaurant last 
night and the lady had just gotten 

945
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,510
married to herself.
it was when we were both.

946
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,750
We found out what's going on over there,
and then someone was like,

947
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,150
she's marrying yourself.
this is your ceremony.

948
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,513
Never seen guys doing that much in my.
My oldest daughter went over and hugged 

949
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:52,330
her and grabbed my oldest daughter is 
the sweetest person in the world.

950
00:39:52,331 --> 00:39:53,164
Yeah.
Yeah.

951
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,080
She was like,
she's so sweeT that the lady who married

952
00:39:56,081 --> 00:39:58,150
herself was like,
your daughter is very sweet.

953
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,320
She wanted to marry her.
She was like,

954
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,480
listen,
I'm married to myself,

955
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:03,970
but I'm you too.
Let's marry everybody.

956
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,333
Yeah.
Um,

957
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,040
but,
uh,

958
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,110
what were we just talking about?
Um,

959
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,580
what the wendy williams show.
Oh my goodness.

960
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,330
Was that when she fell down?
Yeah,

961
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,590
she had,
she had a moment on the show.

962
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,050
Have you seen them?

963
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,620
Have you seen the.
What I saw when aretha died,

964
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:21,963
that aretha had done an interview with 
wendy williams one time and it was 

965
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,533
fucking hilarious because aretha 
franklin was sassing her a bunch of 

966
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,720
like,
oh gee,

967
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,020
sassing.
It was reaLly,

968
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:33,160
really funny,
man,

969
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,290
I don't know if you've seen it,
but she's just like,

970
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:38,380
like a wendy's,
like I have an idea for this project,

971
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,780
whatever it was,
and she was like,

972
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:44,060
so you want to go in on it and a wreath 
is like,

973
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,760
you're going to write a check?
And she's like,

974
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,080
I was thinking you coach.
She was like,

975
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:48,190
oh,
you ain't got it.

976
00:40:48,191 --> 00:40:49,230
Huh?
You ain't got the money.

977
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,340
That's what I thought.
She just turns around on her.

978
00:40:51,341 --> 00:40:53,630
it's so funny.
Hilarious.

979
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:57,430
Read the franklin just so just owns it,
you know,

980
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,160
she's been around.
She was like not having it at all.

981
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,023
Well,
all the show is wendy williams talking 

982
00:41:02,411 --> 00:41:03,244
shit about people and all the girls in 
the audience and they're talking about 

983
00:41:08,981 --> 00:41:13,570
people getting custody and all she 
breaking up with her and it's like,

984
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:14,404
wow,
that's what scares a lot of people out 

985
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,720
there that have an appetite for that.
Uh,

986
00:41:17,721 --> 00:41:18,750
for sure.
I mean,

987
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,880
how long does me,
obviously I sat there watching it,

988
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:26,600
like who will look to help jerry 
springer state on the right look?

989
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,443
Yeah.
That was a fucking 30 plus year run or 

990
00:41:29,591 --> 00:41:31,090
something.
You know what's fucked up about that?

991
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:32,960
Jerry sprInger is a smart guy.
Yeah.

992
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,853
He's a smart guy.
I used to listen to them on the opiod 

993
00:41:35,271 --> 00:41:36,200
anthony show.
I was like,

994
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:37,034
whoa,
wait a minute.

995
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,450
He was the mayor of cincinnati.
Mayerson said he got busted paying for a

996
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:44,900
prostitute with a check.
So we all slip up from time to time.

997
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,460
That's how he got caught.
Yeah.

998
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:49,340
We just hilarious.
Like checking into county on that.

999
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:52,910
Right.
You wanted a lexus who's lexus?

1000
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,920
Yeah.
It's pretty crazy,

1001
00:41:57,921 --> 00:41:59,640
man.
It's a.

1002
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,793
I dunno.
It's.

1003
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,810
I think there's plenty.
What does that.

1004
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,160
Does that him?
Wow.

1005
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,460
That's when he was the mayor.
A young fellow.

1006
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,920
He's like 40 years old back then,
but it's just bizarre how prevalent that

1007
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:16,340
stuff is online.
I mean it's just,

1008
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:19,430
there's so much.
There's so much click baity nonsense.

1009
00:42:19,431 --> 00:42:20,760
It's hard,
but there's,

1010
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,810
there's plenty of good journalism is 
plenty good writing.

1011
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,160
Yeah.
Well,

1012
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:25,941
I mean,
again,

1013
00:42:25,941 --> 00:42:27,900
like I said,
when when I was doing the,

1014
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,110
my,
my limited experience in doing this,

1015
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,580
the vast,
vast,

1016
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:32,414
vast majority of the people that I've 
been talking to have been really 

1017
00:42:34,161 --> 00:42:36,830
interested in just talking about 
adoption and really interested in foster

1018
00:42:36,831 --> 00:42:38,720
care and all that kind of stuff and it's
been great.

1019
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:39,554
It's been great talking,
talking to everYbody and I think that 

1020
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,133
when you have a topic like that too,
it helps because they're not really 

1021
00:42:44,781 --> 00:42:45,614
trying to crush you as much when you're 
know when you're talking to them about 

1022
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:50,630
kids who need families and homes and 
that kind of thing.

1023
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,321
Right,
right,

1024
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:52,154
right.
Yeah,

1025
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,113
yeah.
They have to be careful With letting 

1026
00:42:54,381 --> 00:42:55,670
their piece of shit claws out.

1027
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,413
Now you said that your experience with 
adopting three kids started out as a 

1028
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:04,420
nightmare.
yeah.

1029
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,100
How did it start out as it goes into it?
You know,

1030
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,510
do you have friends that joined the 
military and where they,

1031
00:43:10,511 --> 00:43:12,400
they're in high school,
they think they're really tough and they

1032
00:43:12,401 --> 00:43:12,901
were like,
yeah,

1033
00:43:12,901 --> 00:43:13,760
yeah,
it's going to be awesome.

1034
00:43:13,761 --> 00:43:15,290
And then they go to bootcamp and then 
they're like,

1035
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,030
oh shit,
this is really hard.

1036
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,610
And then they get on top of it and then 
they're good again,

1037
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,473
you know.
But they have to go through that 

1038
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,430
transition of like,
oh man,

1039
00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:23,840
maybe I'm not as tough as I thought I 
was.

1040
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:26,510
And then they get tough.
So you'd never had any kids.

1041
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,750
I never had any kids dog eat dog thing 
there.

1042
00:43:29,751 --> 00:43:33,500
The dog thing.
You to take care of a very small way.

1043
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:35,820
I had a friend who said that to me.

1044
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,070
So I'm like,
well I've had a dog.

1045
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:38,680
Oh yeah.
Talking about having a kid.

1046
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,610
I'm gonna fucking kill you with a rock.
Not compare the two.

1047
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:45,520
Yeah.
And we know we,

1048
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:47,080
we went from,
you know,

1049
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:51,720
zero kids and you kind of think,
well I babysat my sister's kids and that

1050
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:52,910
kind of.
How long that.

1051
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:53,660
Yeah,
that's,

1052
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,180
that's the movie I went to a whole 
movie.

1053
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:00,770
Yeah.
And even what happens is you go.

1054
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:01,604
So,
so for us we had a really interesting 

1055
00:44:03,621 --> 00:44:06,770
experience where we went to an adoption 
fair and that's,

1056
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,610
that's in the movie.
It's a real thing where they,

1057
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,390
because they,
you know,

1058
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,620
their budgets are stretched so tight 
that they'll have these outdoor events,

1059
00:44:15,621 --> 00:44:18,440
not every county has them,
but la county has them where you,

1060
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,170
uh,
where they'll bring a bunch of kids that

1061
00:44:21,171 --> 00:44:22,004
are,
that are in the system and a bunch of a 

1062
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:26,780
prospective parents and they'll just 
have like games and stuff going on.

1063
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,510
It's a really bizarre event.
And we went,

1064
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:31,650
you know,
and you're there to meet kids,

1065
00:44:31,651 --> 00:44:32,700
you know,
to meet your kids.

1066
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:33,563
And uh,
so we went there and we didn't want to 

1067
00:44:35,491 --> 00:44:37,980
have anything to do with teenagers 
because that,

1068
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:38,853
you know,
just because we were scared we thought 

1069
00:44:39,661 --> 00:44:40,860
were,
were not ready for that.

1070
00:44:40,861 --> 00:44:43,520
We just want to find like some little 
cute little kid,

1071
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:44,340
then we can,
you know,

1072
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,290
help out.
And uh,

1073
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,553
and then the teenagers are all off to 
the side because everybody is afraid of 

1074
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:53,190
him and it's the most heartbreaking 
thing you've ever seen because they know

1075
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,024
why they're there.
Like they chose to be there and they 

1076
00:44:55,561 --> 00:44:59,250
know that everybody's scared of him.
So I was there and I was like,

1077
00:44:59,251 --> 00:45:01,020
oh my god,
this is the worst thing I've ever seen.

1078
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:01,854
And we ended up sort of inadvertently 
meeting this teenage girl and her 

1079
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:06,443
brother and sister and just,
they just seemed cool and they just 

1080
00:45:10,111 --> 00:45:12,690
seemed like really good kids and just 
scared,

1081
00:45:12,691 --> 00:45:13,440
scared,
scared.

1082
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,600
But we wrote them down on our sheet and 
just again,

1083
00:45:15,601 --> 00:45:18,420
not what we,
what we had planned on when we did this,

1084
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:19,254
but we wrote them down on our sheet and 
we went home knowing they were going to 

1085
00:45:20,881 --> 00:45:22,980
match us with them because no one else 
was going to put them down.

1086
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,760
And we get home and we find out,
yes,

1087
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:28,290
you've been matched with these kids.
And we're like,

1088
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:29,250
okay,
here we go.

1089
00:45:29,251 --> 00:45:30,600
We're going to have,
you know,

1090
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,540
we're going to have a temperature a,
they were 16,

1091
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,790
13 and 11.
Yeah.

1092
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,130
So,
so we're,

1093
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:41,280
we're kind of wrapping our heads around 
this over the next couple of weeks.

1094
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,530
And we got to a place where we were 
like,

1095
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:44,480
okay,
you know,

1096
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:45,323
we can do this.
And then we got a call from the social 

1097
00:45:46,471 --> 00:45:48,090
worker and she said,
you know,

1098
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,270
um,
it's not going to work out with them.

1099
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,173
The,
uh,

1100
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,010
they've been in the system for four 
years.

1101
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:54,143
The girl,
she's really holding out hope that her 

1102
00:45:56,041 --> 00:45:59,760
mom is coming for.
So she's refusing replacement.

1103
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,930
And so we tried to.
And I was like,

1104
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:04,950
I was,
you know,

1105
00:46:04,951 --> 00:46:06,510
when you hear that,
it's so,

1106
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,790
just the same reaction you guys just 
had.

1107
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:13,400
So my wife and I wrote a letter to send 
through the,

1108
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:15,480
the social workers just saying,
hey look,

1109
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,314
we get it if you maybe you guys just 
want to come and just do the foster 

1110
00:46:19,021 --> 00:46:21,660
thing or you know however you want to do
it.

1111
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:22,490
And we,
we,

1112
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,660
we just sort of sent the letter off.
We didn't hear anything.

1113
00:46:24,661 --> 00:46:26,010
And then she came back and she just 
said,

1114
00:46:26,011 --> 00:46:27,000
yeah,
it's not gonna happen.

1115
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,250
And then she very matter of fact just 
said,

1116
00:46:29,251 --> 00:46:30,084
but there's these other three kids.
And that was kids are my kids now who I 

1117
00:46:34,171 --> 00:46:35,340
love more than anything in the world.

1118
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:37,390
And that's,
that's how just,

1119
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:40,320
there's these other three kids are like,
oh,

1120
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,313
all right,
and you,

1121
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,410
you want there to be,
or I shouldn't say you.

1122
00:46:43,411 --> 00:46:45,390
I mean,
I wanted there to be a certain amount of

1123
00:46:45,391 --> 00:46:48,210
randomness,
like when you have biological kids,

1124
00:46:48,211 --> 00:46:51,060
you don't know what you're going to get 
and go into that,

1125
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:55,530
that event where you're sort of like 
meeting kids and if it feels weird.

1126
00:46:55,531 --> 00:46:58,050
And so when she said there's these other
three kids,

1127
00:46:58,051 --> 00:46:58,681
we said,
okay.

1128
00:46:58,681 --> 00:47:00,630
And then they turned out to be younger,
you know,

1129
00:47:00,631 --> 00:47:03,320
63 and 18 months.
Um,

1130
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:07,770
but I never forgot meeting that,
that girl and her brother and sister.

1131
00:47:07,771 --> 00:47:09,650
So when the,
when the time came that we were going to

1132
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,130
make a movie about it,
I really,

1133
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:13,170
that was the genesis of the lizzie 
character.

1134
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:14,783
I wanted to make sure there was a 
teenager in this movie because they're 

1135
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:18,600
so misunderstood.

1136
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:19,943
And in the process I went out and met 
with a bunch of families that had 

1137
00:47:23,011 --> 00:47:26,460
adopted teen girls and then met with a 
lot of those girls who,

1138
00:47:26,461 --> 00:47:28,680
some of whom are grown up.
And some of them are still,

1139
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,470
you know,
uh,

1140
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:32,890
with their families and,
and this is the thing,

1141
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,753
you know,
the scariness that we're all talking 

1142
00:47:35,171 --> 00:47:36,004
about,
everyone of these families that I met 

1143
00:47:36,941 --> 00:47:40,390
with just great stories,
like amazing,

1144
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:41,950
great stories,
like hard times,

1145
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:42,670
you know,
try it,

1146
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:44,800
trying to make that connection and 
whatever.

1147
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:45,634
But,
but everybody with the same story 

1148
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:50,530
wouldn't have it any other way.
Change our life for the better.

1149
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:53,560
Met these incredible kids.
And uh,

1150
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:55,571
this is.
Yeah.

1151
00:47:55,571 --> 00:47:56,870
And now I'm yammering,
but.

1152
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:00,070
Oh,
how old are they now?

1153
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,260
How many years have you had them?
Uh,

1154
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:03,920
aLmost seven years.
So my son john,

1155
00:48:03,921 --> 00:48:06,760
he just turned 13.
My daughter's nine and my,

1156
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:07,810
my other son is eight.

1157
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,460
And um,
how,

1158
00:48:09,461 --> 00:48:12,820
how long was it between the phone call?
Like I had these other three kids.

1159
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,670
And you actually getting them in your 
house?

1160
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,530
Um,
god,

1161
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,700
what was it?
It was,

1162
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:21,390
it was a couple of weeks because there 
was weeks.

1163
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,360
That's it.
Yeah.

1164
00:48:22,361 --> 00:48:23,650
No,
it wasn't long at all.

1165
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:24,701
But,
uh,

1166
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:25,534
yeah,
it was [inaudible] they called and they 

1167
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:28,960
said we have these other three kids.
And then,

1168
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,550
uh,
and then there was going to be a meeting

1169
00:48:30,551 --> 00:48:31,420
because they,
they,

1170
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:35,560
they won't tell you much about the kids 
until,

1171
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,460
until they really sit down with you and 
then they kind of walk through like,

1172
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:39,370
here's,
you know,

1173
00:48:39,371 --> 00:48:40,960
whatever trauma,
here's whatever,

1174
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:41,794
you know,
kind of.

1175
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,570
And again,
they don't fit in our case,

1176
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:44,883
they don't have all the information 
obviously on their past and they can 

1177
00:48:47,201 --> 00:48:48,034
kind of tell you like,
here's how they came into the and that 

1178
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,410
kind of thing.

1179
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:53,460
So I wasn't able to go because I was,
I was,

1180
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,620
I was at a work thing.
And so my wife went to the meeting and I

1181
00:48:56,621 --> 00:48:58,360
was like listening to it,
you know,

1182
00:48:58,361 --> 00:49:00,010
and that was on speakerphone in the 
meeting.

1183
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:03,040
And uh,
and there was this one moment,

1184
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:03,874
you know,
and she's telling us everything and 

1185
00:49:04,631 --> 00:49:08,500
there's this one moment where she slides
the picture across to my wife says,

1186
00:49:08,501 --> 00:49:10,750
here's a picture of them and there's 
this long pause.

1187
00:49:10,751 --> 00:49:11,980
And my wife goes,
oh,

1188
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,073
they're cute.
But they didn't sound cute by the 

1189
00:49:16,061 --> 00:49:17,590
inflection in their voice.
And you know,

1190
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:20,830
you're trying,
you're trying not to be that guy,

1191
00:49:20,831 --> 00:49:22,630
you know,
what do they look like,

1192
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,420
you know,
you don't want to be shallow about it.

1193
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:26,254
I'm sure kids are kids and you know,
you're going to fall in love with them 

1194
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:29,020
regardless.
But you know,

1195
00:49:29,021 --> 00:49:31,720
like you kinda everybody wants to think 
their own kids are cute,

1196
00:49:31,721 --> 00:49:32,200
whatever.

1197
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,540
So it was funny.
Then when I saw the picture,

1198
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:35,374
the picture was,
it was just a weird bad picture of the 

1199
00:49:37,601 --> 00:49:39,460
kids.
like my son who was six at the time,

1200
00:49:39,461 --> 00:49:41,650
it looked like he was 11 and he looked 
like this.

1201
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,750
It was just the look on his face and 
whatever.

1202
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,430
Yeah.
He looked hard at all and,

1203
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,960
and we go over to the house and these 
kids are adorable.

1204
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:50,411
So.
Oh,

1205
00:49:50,411 --> 00:49:51,970
so this is.
Sorry I'm getting ahead of myself.

1206
00:49:51,971 --> 00:49:53,230
So,
so when you.

1207
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,880
So we have the meeting and we go,
okay,

1208
00:49:54,881 --> 00:49:56,560
we're going to go meet with them.
And just to be clear,

1209
00:49:56,561 --> 00:49:58,390
we didn't say okay because of the 
picture,

1210
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:00,610
because the picture was kind of like 
neither here nor there,

1211
00:50:00,611 --> 00:50:01,391
you know,
we were just like,

1212
00:50:01,391 --> 00:50:02,710
all right,
let's go meet these kids.

1213
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:06,880
So we go to the house and these kids are
adorable and,

1214
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:08,043
and it's the weirdest thing ever because
you go to this foster home where they 

1215
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:15,490
live and you play with them for like two
hours.

1216
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:19,810
And when do you ever play with any kids 
for two straight hours?

1217
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:23,980
like actually actively play with kids,
especially kids you've never met before.

1218
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:29,180
So It's exhausting and it's weird.
And we touch on this in the movie that I

1219
00:50:29,181 --> 00:50:30,014
was really scared when we were getting 
there because I wanted so much to walk 

1220
00:50:33,051 --> 00:50:36,260
in.
See these kids well up with tears.

1221
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,460
No,
it's for real.

1222
00:50:37,461 --> 00:50:38,780
no,
these are my kids.

1223
00:50:38,781 --> 00:50:41,390
And just have that like cosmic 
connection moment.

1224
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:44,900
And that didn't happen at all.
Like it's more weird.

1225
00:50:44,901 --> 00:50:46,220
Right.
So were you,

1226
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,410
I'm going to live with you.
Yeah.

1227
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:49,603
And well the,
the little kids are just kinda like 

1228
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:52,440
this,
you know,

1229
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:53,810
it's actually weird in the other 
direction.

1230
00:50:53,811 --> 00:50:57,680
They're so used to kind of being passed 
around that they're just kinda like,

1231
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:58,161
oh,
okay,

1232
00:50:58,161 --> 00:50:59,670
who are these people,
you know,

1233
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:05,080
and so we get in there and then the,
the foster mom in our case was like a go

1234
00:51:05,181 --> 00:51:06,530
to your mom and dad,
and I was like,

1235
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:07,364
oh,
don't do this,

1236
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:12,640
don't do that because it just felt so 
obtrusive to the kids,

1237
00:51:14,061 --> 00:51:14,894
you know?

1238
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:18,560
And so we would go there every day for 
five straight days.

1239
00:51:18,561 --> 00:51:21,480
We would go there when the kids were off
school and we'd,

1240
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:22,483
we'd go and play with them first in the 
backyard and then you take them to the 

1241
00:51:24,561 --> 00:51:27,410
park and then you take him to the park 
and he'd take them out for ice cream and

1242
00:51:27,411 --> 00:51:28,244
you're just kinda like getting to know 
these kids that are strangers to try to 

1243
00:51:30,891 --> 00:51:32,180
change their names.
Uh,

1244
00:51:32,181 --> 00:51:33,020
yeah.
first day,

1245
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:37,580
as soon as we walked in and I was like,
no,

1246
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:39,423
we didn't do that.
But a little one wouldn't even know 

1247
00:51:41,751 --> 00:51:42,584
though,
dude.

1248
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,491
Yeah,
that's true.

1249
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:44,960
That is true.
That is true.

1250
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:47,630
No memory.
A lot of people do.

1251
00:51:47,631 --> 00:51:49,400
In fact,
a lot of kids,

1252
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:53,270
a lot of older kids that sort of have 
that we'll want to change their name,

1253
00:51:53,271 --> 00:51:55,370
not just a new fresh start.
Yeah.

1254
00:51:55,371 --> 00:51:56,750
That they'll just want to.

1255
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:58,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

1256
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,800
I don't have any experience with that,
but I've heard that,

1257
00:52:00,801 --> 00:52:02,540
that sometimes kids will choose to.
Uh,

1258
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:03,374
there was uh,
a young lady that was at the screenIng 

1259
00:52:05,061 --> 00:52:05,894
last night who was,
who her picture is at the end of the 

1260
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:09,613
movie and she's like,
she's In Ireland getting her phd right 

1261
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,820
now,
this girl that was adopted out of foster

1262
00:52:13,821 --> 00:52:15,680
care and she's,
she's amazing.

1263
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,420
And,
and she,

1264
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,920
she had chosen to change her name.
Yeah.

1265
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:20,783
I mean,
that seems like it would mean something 

1266
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:24,500
now that I think about it,
it just seems,

1267
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:25,880
you know,
changing a name.

1268
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:28,550
Yeah.
Especially as a teen,

1269
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:30,350
but I mean,
I get it if you're saying like,

1270
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:32,150
I want to put everything in the past.
Yeah.

1271
00:52:32,151 --> 00:52:35,090
You want a fresh start.
Really lock it down.

1272
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:37,670
This is the new me.
My name's brian.

1273
00:52:37,671 --> 00:52:39,350
I used to be number eight.
I'm tWenty four now.

1274
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,753
Well,
and that touches on something that is 

1275
00:52:44,091 --> 00:52:47,090
really difficult when you're doing this 
as an adoptive parent,

1276
00:52:47,091 --> 00:52:51,650
is that you're trying to walk this line 
all the time where you know you,

1277
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:54,710
you need to claIm these kids for your 
own.

1278
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:57,840
You need to be the person who's like,
you're with us like we're,

1279
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,910
we're,
we're with you.

1280
00:52:58,911 --> 00:53:00,740
We got your back.
We're behind you like you,

1281
00:53:00,741 --> 00:53:02,210
you,
you need to do that.

1282
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:05,210
That's what these kids don't have.
this thing that we all take for granted.

1283
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:08,990
We have these parents that love us no 
matter what knucklehead things we do,

1284
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:10,063
so you're trying to do that,
but at the same time you're trying not 

1285
00:53:11,571 --> 00:53:12,404
to impose your world on them because 
they're coming into it with their own 

1286
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:20,660
personality and their own culture or 
whatever it is that behind them.

1287
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:21,703
So you're always trying to kind of be 
careful and walk this line between just 

1288
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,130
just completely

1289
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:26,993
bring them in,
but not trying to change them into who 

1290
00:53:29,191 --> 00:53:32,190
you are.
Did thE six year old already have things

1291
00:53:32,191 --> 00:53:35,370
he was really into or sports or 
activities or.

1292
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:36,631
Yeah,
he was.

1293
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:37,464
Well,
the funny thing is my son is really 

1294
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,800
athletic and I'm,
I'm really not so I know you guys are,

1295
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:44,010
but I'm,
I'm so nomis and me especially,

1296
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,053
he's an acrobat.
You saw what I was doing yesterday 

1297
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,670
because an animal,
but uh,

1298
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:51,833
but no,
he's really athletic and he's just 

1299
00:53:52,861 --> 00:53:53,694
always been good with,
with all of that stuff and it's funny 

1300
00:53:56,131 --> 00:53:59,430
for me because I wasn't that kid at all,
but it's great for me because I'm like,

1301
00:53:59,431 --> 00:54:02,850
he's able to do the stuff that I wanted 
so badly when I was little.

1302
00:54:02,851 --> 00:54:03,684
I suckEd at sports and I so wanted to be
good at sports and he's really good at 

1303
00:54:06,571 --> 00:54:07,740
it and it makes me.

1304
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,030
What does he play?
Well,

1305
00:54:09,031 --> 00:54:10,350
he,
whatever he plays,

1306
00:54:10,351 --> 00:54:11,184
he's just tends to be pretty good at it.
So he played flag football for awhile 

1307
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:17,700
and he's playing lacrosse now and he's 
played soccer or lacrosse and football.

1308
00:54:17,701 --> 00:54:19,770
We're just planning it with brendan 
schaub the other day.

1309
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:22,620
I had no idea how many people get 
knocked the fuck out.

1310
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:24,660
Playing lacrosse.
Lacrosse is.

1311
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,440
Oh my god.
Island man.

1312
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,950
Violent.
We were saying like there's a difference

1313
00:54:28,951 --> 00:54:30,390
between this,
even in football,

1314
00:54:30,391 --> 00:54:33,000
in that they're striking,
each are allowed to.

1315
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:34,710
You're allowed to hit each other with 
the stick,

1316
00:54:34,711 --> 00:54:35,544
but they're also striking each other 
with elbows to running in and they have 

1317
00:54:39,091 --> 00:54:39,924
the stick in their hand and they're 
elbowing each other in the face as the 

1318
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:42,960
running.
I mean,

1319
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,793
oh shit.
It's a crazy amount of force that they 

1320
00:54:45,691 --> 00:54:46,510
generate.
Oh yeah.

1321
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:47,343
And these kids are getting flatlined 
because I had dale earnhardt jr here 

1322
00:54:52,321 --> 00:54:54,660
that day on really nice guy.

1323
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,370
Great guy.
Suffered 12 concussions over a period of

1324
00:54:59,371 --> 00:55:01,140
four years racing.
Yes.

1325
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,153
And has some significant brain damage 
because of it that he had to go through 

1326
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:07,463
therapy for to,
to help them like to the point where he 

1327
00:55:09,151 --> 00:55:12,300
was walking and he had to hold onto 
things because his balance was so fucked

1328
00:55:12,301 --> 00:55:13,230
up.
He couldn't,

1329
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,093
couldn't just walk,
couldn't get off the couch and walk to 

1330
00:55:15,811 --> 00:55:16,644
the bathroom.
He had to hold onto like a table and a 

1331
00:55:18,511 --> 00:55:19,344
chair and hit him.
Make his way through all of this from 

1332
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:22,523
concussions.
And you know what they're getting in 

1333
00:55:25,141 --> 00:55:26,670
lacrosse.
So they're getting in football,

1334
00:55:26,671 --> 00:55:28,590
it's all the same shit.
Head trauma,

1335
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:29,573
head trauma.
Yeah.

1336
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:30,870
So I'm a terrible parent.

1337
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,713
My kids go to a very nice school.
It's a great school and we went to a 

1338
00:55:36,121 --> 00:55:36,954
football game the other day where the 
older kids are playing football and I'm 

1339
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:40,344
just sitting there.
All the other parents are having a good 

1340
00:55:41,941 --> 00:55:43,260
time and I'm like,
brain damage,

1341
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:45,120
braIn damage.
There's some brain damage.

1342
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,080
there's some brain.
I'm like,

1343
00:55:46,081 --> 00:55:48,030
jesus fucking christ.
These are kids.

1344
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:50,220
They're kids running at each of the full
clip,

1345
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:51,143
smashing it with Jordan falling to the 
ground and see the kid get up slow and 

1346
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,550
hope put his hands on the ground.
He's all fucked up.

1347
00:55:56,551 --> 00:55:57,480
I'm like,
this is crazy.

1348
00:55:57,481 --> 00:56:00,550
Like I felt like people.
I always felt like lacrosse because my,

1349
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:04,640
my high school had lacrosse too and I 
always felt like it was way crazier ones

1350
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:07,050
because I didn't know about it.
And then I'm at the school and they have

1351
00:56:07,051 --> 00:56:07,770
it.
I'm like,

1352
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:11,360
this shit is.
Because they have stiffness.

1353
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,330
Yeah.
And they're just,

1354
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,231
oh yeah,
of course.

1355
00:56:13,231 --> 00:56:14,520
Yes.
If you're a football player,

1356
00:56:14,521 --> 00:56:18,360
you can become some herschel walker type
character and become a baller.

1357
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:19,223
Yeah,
that's true.

1358
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,570
But you got no shot if you're a lacrosse
player.

1359
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:23,590
I love when they interview like all the 
guys,

1360
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:24,130
the nfl,

1361
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,030
they're like,
uh,

1362
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:26,980
the young guys to like,
you know,

1363
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,113
all this evidence is that your lifespan 
is going to be way shorter and it's 

1364
00:56:31,271 --> 00:56:32,104
gonna be probably horrific at some point
because of the impact of what you're 

1365
00:56:36,611 --> 00:56:38,560
going through playing football,
you know,

1366
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:39,840
what did you think about that?
The like,

1367
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:40,661
shit's worth it,
man.

1368
00:56:40,661 --> 00:56:43,780
This is awesome lifestyle.
Nobody is like,

1369
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,680
you're getting some guys that you see 
retire early,

1370
00:56:47,681 --> 00:56:51,100
which was unheard of 10 years ago.
Guys.

1371
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:54,100
One guy came out,
played his rookie year and retired,

1372
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:55,870
you know,
you're getting guys early retirement.

1373
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,640
Um,
some guys play,

1374
00:56:57,641 --> 00:57:00,760
finish out a contractor up for a big 
contract and they're out.

1375
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,870
Yeah,
that's happening.

1376
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:03,370
But there's still,
you know,

1377
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:04,323
there's no shortage of guys were like,
I'll take the guarantee whatever my 

1378
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:09,680
signing bonuses and take some brain 
damage it.

1379
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:14,230
That's how our brains work.
Our brains are designed to not have that

1380
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:16,240
kind of foresight and you get much 
older.

1381
00:57:16,241 --> 00:57:17,074
Of course,
young satisfy me now and I don't know 

1382
00:57:20,051 --> 00:57:22,120
what that is,
but you can tell people,

1383
00:57:22,121 --> 00:57:23,470
hey,
whatever it is you're doing right now,

1384
00:57:23,471 --> 00:57:26,950
this is really good at causing 
irreparable harm when like today.

1385
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:27,910
No.
Well fuck it.

1386
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:28,460
You know?

1387
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:30,200
Well,
that's the same way we deal with climate

1388
00:57:30,201 --> 00:57:31,300
change.
Yeah.

1389
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:32,503
Literally the same thing.
People were driving around with cars 

1390
00:57:34,071 --> 00:57:35,000
blowing smoke.
I like,

1391
00:57:35,001 --> 00:57:37,470
yeah,
one day of every fucking fix it.

1392
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:38,683
There's going to be a real problem.
You tell someone to be a real problem 

1393
00:57:40,551 --> 00:57:42,860
here on earth and like 300 years and 
they're like,

1394
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,400
that sucks.
Whatever,

1395
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,850
whatever.
I won't be here bro.

1396
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,770
Or even 40 years,
sadly.

1397
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:49,663
Yeah.
It will be like,

1398
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,013
there's also the issue is people that 
get a lot of head trauma that they get 

1399
00:57:53,601 --> 00:57:55,940
very impulsive and they,
um,

1400
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:59,550
they don't make good decisions anyway.
So even if you know,

1401
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:03,080
even if they could have the foresight,
they probably would make good decisions.

1402
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:05,330
They're don't,
they're not thinking rationally.

1403
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:08,420
And they did some study.
What was that study jamie?

1404
00:58:08,421 --> 00:58:10,970
We've referenced this before where they,
um,

1405
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:11,893
they looked at kIds that play football 
literally from pop warner all the way 

1406
00:58:17,031 --> 00:58:20,190
through college and how many of them 
have ct?

1407
00:58:20,191 --> 00:58:21,680
He really,
oh,

1408
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:24,020
jesus chrIst.
It's stunning.

1409
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,190
See,
I always felt like my,

1410
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,043
my point of view on it was always like,
I played football fourth grade through 

1411
00:58:29,801 --> 00:58:30,900
high school,
right.

1412
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,610
And I always just like men.
That's why you're so fucked up.

1413
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:34,473
I know,
I know,

1414
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,100
but I just feel like,
you know,

1415
00:58:36,101 --> 00:58:38,970
the,
like you have definitely some big in a,

1416
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:41,140
in an amateur career,
you have some,

1417
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:42,280
you can think back.
Like,

1418
00:58:42,281 --> 00:58:44,500
man,
I got my bell rung a bell rung.

1419
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,320
I don't know.
I mean probably,

1420
00:58:47,321 --> 00:58:48,154
I mean here's the thing,
in fourth grade and fifth grade you're 

1421
00:58:49,661 --> 00:58:51,250
like,
that doesn't happen really.

1422
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,960
I mean kids were like,
you know,

1423
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:55,420
walking up and wrapping up slowly.
You,

1424
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:56,303
you're playing with kids who will 
eventually not play football even in 

1425
00:58:58,331 --> 00:59:01,780
sixth grade.
So it starts to be,

1426
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:02,853
you might have like a stud on a team in 
middle school and still a bunch of guys 

1427
00:59:07,061 --> 00:59:09,550
that won't play in high school and in 
high school.

1428
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,730
Yeah,
there's definitely some uh,

1429
00:59:12,731 --> 00:59:13,564
athletes that stand out for sure.
I mean those are the kids that will 

1430
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,990
eventually go on,
but you play teams are and there's weeks

1431
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:21,680
where you're just like,
no one is

1432
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,630
really good on this team,
you know,

1433
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,080
and you'll have a game where you'll feel
like,

1434
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:28,700
yeah,
I mean there was a couple of,

1435
00:59:28,701 --> 00:59:29,534
I've got a couple good hits and there 
was nothing really have impact and then 

1436
00:59:32,301 --> 00:59:33,134
something will stand out.
Like you'll play a school that has like 

1437
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:37,340
an allstate or all american player.
You're like,

1438
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:41,690
holy shit,
that guy fucking fucked me up bad.

1439
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,340
And,
and you remember it.

1440
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,213
I mean I remember it to this day,
some of those like really standout guys 

1441
00:59:48,141 --> 00:59:50,540
and you're like,
that hit stuck with me,

1442
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,510
but that's once a year that you play 
that guy,

1443
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:54,373
right?
Or that you remember a school that good 

1444
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:02,480
and then if you don't go on to play in 
college really feels like kind of a,

1445
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:04,760
I don't know,
a risk assessment where you're like,

1446
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:07,230
I didn't feel like that was,
you know,

1447
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,180
do I have damage?

1448
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:09,290
I don't know.
But I mean,

1449
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:10,843
once you get into college,
football is where I feel like that's 

1450
01:00:13,761 --> 01:00:17,990
where you're really playing with really 
good athletes.

1451
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:19,940
A friend of mine,
a guy in his neighborhood,

1452
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:20,813
I'm a kid who was 21 committed suicide 
and he was a college player who was 

1453
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,700
about to go into,
into the pros.

1454
01:00:28,701 --> 01:00:31,430
He was 21 years old really.
And um,

1455
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:34,370
the uh,
significant cte,

1456
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,610
like just really ravaged.
He,

1457
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,800
every year a player played tackle 
football under the age,

1458
01:00:39,801 --> 01:00:40,634
predicted the early onset of cognitive 
problems by two point four years in 

1459
01:00:44,181 --> 01:00:46,700
behavioral and mood problems by two 
point five years.

1460
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,960
Yeah.
But there's a study.

1461
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:49,103
This is okay.
Our study found that 211 players who 

1462
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,063
diagnosed with cte after death,
who played tackle football before age 

1463
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:56,084
12,
suffered from cognitive behavioral and 

1464
01:00:58,341 --> 01:01:02,690
mood symptoms earlier than those players
didn't start to play till after age 12.

1465
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,390
They're saying that,
okay,

1466
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:06,283
study included 246 former players,
211 of whom were diagnosed with cte 

1467
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,550
after death.
That's insane.

1468
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:14,773
Blinn college,
there's,

1469
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:15,643
there's definitely,
there's no such thing as getting around 

1470
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:20,420
real high impact hits.
That's it.

1471
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,070
Those are all people that know how to 
play.

1472
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,293
They're all athletes getting rock.
What they're realizing now is that 

1473
01:01:26,571 --> 01:01:27,404
subconcussive trauma is what's 
responsible for the majority of brain 

1474
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,200
damage.
What's subconcussive?

1475
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:35,720
You're not getting a concussion.
Oh yeah.

1476
01:01:35,721 --> 01:01:36,554
You just get rattled.
Getting rattled where it's not even 

1477
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,400
fucking you up,
but over time,

1478
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,353
over time,
that over and multiple hits that are 

1479
01:01:43,101 --> 01:01:43,934
just not.
They're not knocking you out that just 

1480
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,330
jostling you.
You can always happen a lot.

1481
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,193
Yeah.
Even get it from getting hit to the 

1482
01:01:49,071 --> 01:01:50,100
body.
Right?

1483
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,153
When you get hit to the body and your 
head snaps back and you don't even get 

1484
01:01:53,421 --> 01:01:56,750
hit in the head and you're like throwing
up and your head's all fucked up and you

1485
01:01:56,751 --> 01:01:57,890
try and figure out what's going on.

1486
01:01:58,190 --> 01:02:01,160
It's because your brain's been moshing 
around inside of your head.

1487
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:02,930
Yeah.
The thing that I remember too,

1488
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:03,823
the thing that stands out is when you.
Because it's such thing as like bracing 

1489
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:08,360
for a hit and then feeling it and you're
like,

1490
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:10,790
fuck,
but when you don't see someone coming.

1491
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:13,280
Oh yeah,
that's like a fight.

1492
01:02:13,281 --> 01:02:14,750
You know?
You don't see a punch comIng.

1493
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:16,460
Oh yeah,
100 percent.

1494
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,800
Yeah.
Yeah,

1495
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:18,650
it's,
it's,

1496
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,790
it's dangerous.
You guys are saving my child's life,

1497
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:22,260
right?
I'm telling you right now.

1498
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,460
He's good.
It's funny because I,

1499
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:24,463
I don't know that much about lacrosse.
I had to actually like youtube lacrosse 

1500
01:02:27,361 --> 01:02:29,940
to be like,
how did you some of the video?

1501
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,073
Because there's some videos of some 
fucking hits that we were watching the 

1502
01:02:32,821 --> 01:02:35,130
other day and brendan played lacrosse in
college.

1503
01:02:35,131 --> 01:02:38,040
He played lacrosse in college and 
football jesus,

1504
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:40,950
and then he fought in the ufc,
so his brain looks like a walnut.

1505
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:42,660
It's got to be man.
You talked to him.

1506
01:02:42,661 --> 01:02:47,661
You kind of know it's a,
it's a crazy fucking sports.

1507
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,640
People would watch these guys just over 
and over again.

1508
01:02:53,641 --> 01:02:56,680
These guys getting code,
boom,

1509
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,860
boom.
See that?

1510
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:02,550
I mean they're smashing each other.
The impact is horrific.

1511
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,530
Oh look at that.
Boom.

1512
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:06,240
This.
These are strikes.

1513
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:08,490
This is like me kicking somebody in the 
head.

1514
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:10,163
This is,
this is not much different than a kick 

1515
01:03:11,731 --> 01:03:14,100
in the head.
You just bring them with an elbow,

1516
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:16,890
but the amount of force.
so these guys getting kicked in the head

1517
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:21,180
with these helmets on and if you think 
the helmet is protecting your head,

1518
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,640
that shit ain't protecting anything.
Boom.

1519
01:03:23,641 --> 01:03:25,350
Look at that.
Boom.

1520
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:25,860
All right,
look,

1521
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:29,070
I don't know anything about this stuff,
but I've thought for a long time.

1522
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:31,950
Hard helmets.
Got to just make it worse,

1523
01:03:31,951 --> 01:03:32,850
right?
Well,

1524
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:36,900
it makes you more confident that you got
slammed your head into somebody and then

1525
01:03:36,901 --> 01:03:39,930
you don't realize how bad you're getting
fucked up from that.

1526
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,260
You know it's your head when you get hit
in the head,

1527
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:46,170
even though you have a helmet on it,
it's not going to crack your skull,

1528
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:50,870
your brain cells still subset.
It's hitting you.

1529
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:55,050
You get serious punishment.
Smashing around in there.

1530
01:03:55,051 --> 01:03:58,090
You're all the connective tissue.
It's like,

1531
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:58,933
oh,
it's awful.

1532
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,170
It's awful.
Boom.

1533
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:03,570
And this is coming from a guy who's 
probably seen.

1534
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:08,960
I probably see more people get fucked up
than 99 point nine percent of the people

1535
01:04:09,361 --> 01:04:12,900
that have ever lived in terms of like 
being there live.

1536
01:04:12,901 --> 01:04:14,670
When someone got the fuck beat out of 
them,

1537
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:15,633
I probably see more people get the fuck 
beat out of him than almost anyone 

1538
01:04:19,741 --> 01:04:20,574
that's ever lived in history.
It's probably a small handful of people 

1539
01:04:23,761 --> 01:04:24,960
that have seen more.
Sure.

1540
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:26,910
So yeah.
How many fights have you called?

1541
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,560
Hundreds.
Thousands.

1542
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:31,290
Thousands.
At least more than a thousand.

1543
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:33,900
Probably 2,000.
But then I've seen more.

1544
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,153
I've seen a bunch of live in.
when I was competing I saw a bunch of 

1545
01:04:37,741 --> 01:04:39,180
people get fucked up.
I mean it's just,

1546
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:44,070
I've seen it a lot.
It's that when you can avoid that,

1547
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:45,050
avoid it,
you know,

1548
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:47,560
especially something like lacrosse,
you can't,

1549
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:49,190
can't make a career out of it,
like,

1550
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,033
get out of there because they actually 
just started because right now I'm used 

1551
01:04:53,191 --> 01:04:56,490
to like kids soccer where they're just 
running around chasing the ball.

1552
01:04:56,491 --> 01:04:57,280
It's cute.
It's fun.

1553
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,700
It's fun to watch.
And uh,

1554
01:04:59,701 --> 01:05:00,534
and yeah,
my son just got into lacrosse and we 

1555
01:05:01,741 --> 01:05:03,690
play catch with the lacrosse stick and 
it's great.

1556
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:04,524
We,
we have a good time playing catch with 

1557
01:05:05,371 --> 01:05:05,701
it.
But no,

1558
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:08,070
I haven't seen him getting about tennis,
men's soccer,

1559
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:10,310
even soccer.
Which you think you know like who?

1560
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,400
Who's getting hurt in soccer?

1561
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:14,640
Soccer from heading the ball,
just heading the ball.

1562
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:16,380
The ball flying at you,
hit it with your head.

1563
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:21,620
Soccer are suffering from cte to the 
point where they're starting to minimize

1564
01:05:22,091 --> 01:05:24,670
the amount of heading they do in 
practices.

1565
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:26,230
Really?
Yes.

1566
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:29,410
This is what we're finding out about 
brains like this is,

1567
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:30,910
you know,
there's a good friend of mine,

1568
01:05:30,911 --> 01:05:33,910
Dr.
Mark Gordon who specializes in cte.

1569
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:34,923
He deals with a lot of soldiers coming 
back and a lot of them that are like my 

1570
01:05:37,931 --> 01:05:38,764
friend andrew marr where they would blow
open doors so they'd set up a charge on 

1571
01:05:43,151 --> 01:05:46,810
a door and step back and break the door.
Blow these guys.

1572
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:47,663
I mean he didn't even get hit with 
anything or maybe I add like that are 

1573
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:51,093
nearby.
Those guys suffer significant brain 

1574
01:05:53,771 --> 01:05:58,771
damage and it's just from the impact of 
just getting shook by an explosion.

1575
01:05:59,771 --> 01:06:01,870
Not even anything actually hitting them 
in the head.

1576
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:04,900
Which high school sport as the most 
concussions.

1577
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:07,720
Is it soccer girls,
soccer girls,

1578
01:06:07,721 --> 01:06:08,554
soccer.
Cheerleading had rates seen at boys 

1579
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:13,660
football by 2015.
Wow.

1580
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:16,210
I know when you stop and you look at 
those,

1581
01:06:16,211 --> 01:06:17,044
uh,
like when they're going to commercial 

1582
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:21,550
and the college game and they throw that
grew up in the air and you're like,

1583
01:06:21,551 --> 01:06:22,750
man,
to get that right.

1584
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:23,763
I saw a documentary,
but it's one of the most dangerous 

1585
01:06:25,391 --> 01:06:26,224
sports.
Sure.

1586
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,620
This is high school cheerleading because
they do,

1587
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:33,490
these girls fall on a gym floor.
I just smack their heads on the floor.

1588
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:34,940
It's crazy.
There's a,

1589
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,020
there's a,
um,

1590
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,130
breakdancing,
instagram page called stance elements.

1591
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:43,570
Jamie pullups dance elements is a guy 
who looks like he's about 300 pounds and

1592
01:06:43,571 --> 01:06:46,660
he break dances.
He leaps forward and lands on the top of

1593
01:06:46,661 --> 01:06:48,580
his head and keeps his feet up in the 
air.

1594
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:50,890
I don't know how the fuck this guy did 
this.

1595
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:52,810
This guy's bigger than burt.
Really?

1596
01:06:52,811 --> 01:06:54,390
Yeah.
Maybe not as big.

1597
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,273
Bird committee is pretty big and he 
leaps forward and he's lands on his 

1598
01:06:59,951 --> 01:07:02,440
head.
No hands lands on his head with his feet

1599
01:07:02,441 --> 01:07:06,790
up there and holds the position for like
a silent second is preposterous.

1600
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:09,370
And when you can do that trick,
you look at this guy,

1601
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:10,720
whoa.
Yeah.

1602
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:11,953
Well,
the size of them,

1603
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:13,180
oh my gosh,
this.

1604
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:14,573
Give me some via

1605
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:20,223
that guy.

1606
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,880
We'll need a disc replacement within the
next month

1607
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,153
is so much weight on your fucking head.
He's probably so dizzy and he's playing 

1608
01:07:32,231 --> 01:07:32,780
it all.
Yeah,

1609
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:34,350
no shit bro.
Look at that.

1610
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:36,340
Oh,
I got to tell you,

1611
01:07:36,341 --> 01:07:40,300
you guys are making me feel so good 
about my mostly sedentary lifestyle that

1612
01:07:40,301 --> 01:07:43,770
I've lived my whole life.
It's safer.

1613
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:45,083
You're definitely don't.
Don't hit your head at this is coming 

1614
01:07:46,991 --> 01:07:49,420
from somebody who watches people,
get their head hit for a living.

1615
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:51,653
I'm feeling really good now.
Usually I feel more ashamed for the way 

1616
01:07:54,461 --> 01:07:58,660
that I've been conducting myself.
It's just when you can avoid it.

1617
01:07:58,661 --> 01:07:59,200
I mean,
look,

1618
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,033
it's not a bad way to make a living.
If you want to be a fighter and you 

1619
01:08:02,201 --> 01:08:05,140
really want to do it and that's your 
drive,

1620
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:06,013
that you should do it,
but you should really learn how to 

1621
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:10,630
defend yourself correctly and learn the 
right technique,

1622
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:11,913
but when you're doing it for recreation 
and you're doing something like the 

1623
01:08:14,501 --> 01:08:17,630
cross where running at each other full 
clip and smashing into each other,

1624
01:08:17,631 --> 01:08:22,631
and that's within the rules like I think
we're operating on ancient information.

1625
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:23,893
That's what I think.
I think most of these systems that 

1626
01:08:25,011 --> 01:08:25,844
they're setting up most of these,
these sports rules and a lot of the 

1627
01:08:30,051 --> 01:08:33,620
organizations,
they're all operating on these old ideas

1628
01:08:33,621 --> 01:08:34,454
of brain damage.
That's why I'm freaking out when I'm 

1629
01:08:35,841 --> 01:08:38,960
going to this school football game and 
I'm watching this,

1630
01:08:38,961 --> 01:08:42,380
I'm like,
like this is just brain damage and brain

1631
01:08:42,381 --> 01:08:43,214
damage and then watching it.
That's promoted by a school and school 

1632
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:46,460
pride.
Yay.

1633
01:08:46,461 --> 01:08:47,900
Everybody go,
yeah,

1634
01:08:47,901 --> 01:08:48,531
yeah,
yeah.

1635
01:08:48,531 --> 01:08:50,240
We're playing another team.
Let's hope we beat them.

1636
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:52,760
How do you going to beat him?
You're going to fucking slam into them,

1637
01:08:53,150 --> 01:08:56,060
give them concussions and going to go to
school and they can't count.

1638
01:08:56,090 --> 01:09:00,080
Do you get blowback for talking about 
that stuff or from fans and that kind of

1639
01:09:00,081 --> 01:09:00,914
thing?
No,

1640
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:01,830
it's true.
Yeah.

1641
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:02,481
I really,
I mean,

1642
01:09:02,481 --> 01:09:03,940
I'm sure there must be some blow back.

1643
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:06,560
I don't read it anyway,
but it's got to be true.

1644
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:09,440
I mean,
it's just too much evidence.

1645
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:14,800
I just think you choose wisely choose.
They don't not take risks.

1646
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:18,860
I mean if you really want to be a bmx 
rider or a professional skateboarder,

1647
01:09:18,861 --> 01:09:19,694
you're going to take some knocks.
It's just part of the part of the 

1648
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:23,480
program.
Just don't,

1649
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:25,580
don't do it if you don't have to.
Yeah,

1650
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:29,420
because it,
it piles up and there's no coming back.

1651
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:30,920
You know,
when you,

1652
01:09:30,921 --> 01:09:35,000
when you go in,
you have like significant brain damage.

1653
01:09:35,150 --> 01:09:36,500
I mean,
you can get therapy,

1654
01:09:36,501 --> 01:09:37,820
they can help you.
It can,

1655
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:39,170
but you're,
you're gonna,

1656
01:09:39,171 --> 01:09:41,660
you're gonna be a road,
you're going down.

1657
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:43,160
It's your brain.

1658
01:09:43,330 --> 01:09:44,420
I know they see the,
the.

1659
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:49,500
I mean hbo is actually tapped into it a 
lot with that real sports show for years

1660
01:09:49,861 --> 01:09:50,694
now.
They've been doing follow up pieces on 

1661
01:09:52,290 --> 01:09:53,123
cte and men.
It is devastating to see some of those 

1662
01:09:57,091 --> 01:09:57,924
guests.
Those guys are like in their fifties or 

1663
01:10:00,150 --> 01:10:03,840
sixties and they're not there at all.

1664
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,833
Dude.
I put a video up on instagram or on 

1665
01:10:06,581 --> 01:10:07,414
twitter or retweeted it and it's boxers 
where it shows the boxers when they're 

1666
01:10:11,351 --> 01:10:12,184
young and they're talking and then it 
shows them like at the end of their 

1667
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:15,723
career they're retiring.
And then In the interview them and you 

1668
01:10:17,641 --> 01:10:18,280
see them,
like,

1669
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,710
just completely gone,
like a shell

1670
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:25,830
interview with riddIck bowe really bad.
Oh,

1671
01:10:25,831 --> 01:10:26,664
it's awful.
And I remember even at this one was 

1672
01:10:28,201 --> 01:10:30,780
actually kind of funny.
Was a james tony.

1673
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:32,563
Hm.

1674
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:37,320
Because he was,
hE was,

1675
01:10:37,321 --> 01:10:38,154
uh,
It was towards the end of his fighting 

1676
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:43,110
and he was definitely at least 40 pounds
overweight,

1677
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:44,063
right?
Like really out of shape but still 

1678
01:10:45,661 --> 01:10:46,494
throwing bombs and he was sparring and 
it was like that piece that they air 

1679
01:10:50,761 --> 01:10:53,850
right before the fighters go to the ring
for the,

1680
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:54,743
on fight night.
And I mean he's definitely taken some 

1681
01:10:57,901 --> 01:10:58,734
shots and given some shots,
but he was sparring and they were 

1682
01:11:01,201 --> 01:11:03,930
throwing in fresh bodies for him to spar
against.

1683
01:11:03,931 --> 01:11:05,510
So it was like,
you know,

1684
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:07,530
two mInutes with this guy.
And then boom,

1685
01:11:07,531 --> 01:11:08,364
fresh body and as he's lIke,
he is like really hyperventilation spit 

1686
01:11:13,691 --> 01:11:14,130
and

1687
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:19,050
he's still talking shit like at,
as he's fighting,

1688
01:11:19,051 --> 01:11:24,051
he's like blah blah.
And just.

1689
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:27,990
And then they bring in the guys like 
your mom,

1690
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,840
he just,
he's a mess.

1691
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,660
It looks like a total mess,
but he's just like talking shit,

1692
01:11:33,661 --> 01:11:34,494
calling guys shit.
Like as he's barely making it through 

1693
01:11:38,611 --> 01:11:40,740
these,
these sparring sessions and you know,

1694
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:41,920
I mean he,
he needs.

1695
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:43,260
But he's one of those guys he had to 
fight.

1696
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:45,060
He had to fight.
Well,

1697
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,590
especially towards the end of his 
career,

1698
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,780
he took a fight in the ufc.
He did?

1699
01:11:48,781 --> 01:11:49,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

1700
01:11:49,801 --> 01:11:52,980
He's the only like real world champ

1701
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:53,833
peon boxer that ever fought in mixed 
martial arts and the ufc and randy 

1702
01:11:58,161 --> 01:12:00,290
couture ankle picked him,
took him down,

1703
01:12:00,291 --> 01:12:02,330
strangled them right away.
Yeah.

1704
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:03,520
It was easy.
Yeah.

1705
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:07,270
I mean there's just,
you know,

1706
01:12:07,271 --> 01:12:08,104
he,
I don't even think he really bothered 

1707
01:12:08,781 --> 01:12:09,614
learning talking to tony.
I think he just put the gloves on and 

1708
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:16,070
got In there and just had no idea what 
to do.

1709
01:12:16,071 --> 01:12:19,520
When randy got ahold of him,
he was clearly untrained when it came to

1710
01:12:19,521 --> 01:12:22,040
the gravity of this low ankle,
low single.

1711
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:24,560
I mean this is the beginning of the 
fight.

1712
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:28,400
Randy just immediately mount some 
punches him in the head a bunch of times

1713
01:12:28,401 --> 01:12:32,870
and then strangled them and you know,
randy was just honestly being nice.

1714
01:12:33,170 --> 01:12:33,741
Really?
Yeah.

1715
01:12:33,741 --> 01:12:36,020
He could have punished them a lot longer
if you want it to.

1716
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:40,700
He just wanted to finish them up.
It was sad because it was just,

1717
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:42,233
it,
you know,

1718
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:43,123
he was talking about all these guys just
don't know how to handle his hands and 

1719
01:12:46,011 --> 01:12:48,650
every fight starts standing up and which
is true.

1720
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:53,650
But randy coture will take you down all 
day anytime he wants.

1721
01:12:53,810 --> 01:12:56,300
And then he got him in an arm triangle,
just smushed them.

1722
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,670
I mean,
even when he's punching him,

1723
01:12:58,671 --> 01:13:00,110
he's not even hitting him that hard 
here.

1724
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:02,090
He's just trying to force them to give 
something up.

1725
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:04,363
That's what he wants.
He wants his head tied down against the 

1726
01:13:07,581 --> 01:13:09,140
side of his arm and he's going to squish
them.

1727
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:10,490
And as you tap,
that's it.

1728
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:12,360
It's wrap.
didn't take apart.

1729
01:13:12,361 --> 01:13:14,570
It was pretty quick.
That was pretty fast.

1730
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:15,733
And james,
tony's one of the best that ever did it 

1731
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:19,850
a phenomenal boxer,
but just need.

1732
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,930
I talked to a lot of shit.
It was shit talker.

1733
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:27,120
Yeah.
So I don't want to discourage you,

1734
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:27,841
but.
No,

1735
01:13:27,841 --> 01:13:28,251
no,
no.

1736
01:13:28,251 --> 01:13:31,560
this is you show your son.
So these videos,

1737
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:34,770
because we're out in the backyard 
playing catch,

1738
01:13:34,771 --> 01:13:38,790
it's just like a slice of America.
They're not even thinking about this.

1739
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:40,103
People operate not totally aware of 
consequences and they make choices that 

1740
01:13:43,111 --> 01:13:44,640
will affect them for the rest of their 
lives.

1741
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:45,750
Yes.
That's what I mean.

1742
01:13:45,751 --> 01:13:49,210
I love my job.
I mean you guys are kind of like,

1743
01:13:49,211 --> 01:13:52,160
I'm having that feeling right now 
because I love my kids so much.

1744
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:53,140
I think.
Oh wow.

1745
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:54,413
Basketball?
Yeah,

1746
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:55,411
he does.
Yeah.

1747
01:13:55,411 --> 01:13:56,960
Basketball's a great support.
Yeah.

1748
01:13:56,961 --> 01:13:59,730
There's no no contact and guaranteed 
contracts,

1749
01:13:59,731 --> 01:14:02,290
man.
if you mentioned the best,

1750
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:03,630
how tall is he?
Not tom.

1751
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:05,190
Yeah.
Okay.

1752
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:07,260
What about baseball?
It's another one.

1753
01:14:07,370 --> 01:14:09,660
Baseball.
Baseball is the bomb.

1754
01:14:09,690 --> 01:14:11,470
Diggity.
As long as you only hit a bit of pitch,

1755
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:16,060
you'd hit with a pitch that than that.
That's the lifestyle,

1756
01:14:16,061 --> 01:14:16,894
man.
I don't know if I'm allowed to do this 

1757
01:14:20,951 --> 01:14:21,784
here,
but while we're here I really wanted to 

1758
01:14:22,871 --> 01:14:25,960
talk about how tom got into this movie 
and we talk about that.

1759
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:29,020
What do you mean allowed to just like 
totally like,

1760
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:30,011
you know,
jump,

1761
01:14:30,011 --> 01:14:35,011
jump tracks like that and just throw in 
rules podcast.

1762
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:39,310
Yeah.
How did he get into this?

1763
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:41,040
How did I get into this?
So,

1764
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:42,723
so I,
I saw stand up and I thought I thought 

1765
01:14:45,341 --> 01:14:46,174
it was really funny and we had already 
written a draft of the script and I was 

1766
01:14:48,731 --> 01:14:49,301
like,
oh man,

1767
01:14:49,301 --> 01:14:50,890
this guy would,
would be a great russ.

1768
01:14:50,891 --> 01:14:51,724
And I didn't really think too much about
it because we were making another movie 

1769
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:54,124
at the time.
And then when it came back around we 

1770
01:14:55,721 --> 01:14:57,100
were talking about,
you know,

1771
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:57,993
just talking about different people that
you're going to cast and you get these 

1772
01:15:00,131 --> 01:15:02,860
boards up and see your picture was 
actually on a board for a while.

1773
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:04,060
Wow.
I don't think you even knew that.

1774
01:15:04,061 --> 01:15:05,680
I didn't know that picture was on a 
board.

1775
01:15:05,681 --> 01:15:07,250
I did not know that.
And uh,

1776
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:08,740
so then,
um,

1777
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:11,770
so tell it from your angle when you got 
the call though,

1778
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,680
because I'll tell you this,
so I didn't know if you,

1779
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:16,600
I don't even know if you know this,
that I passed on the audition.

1780
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:17,420
I do,
yeah.

1781
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:18,870
Yeah,
a good.

1782
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,250
So when they,
you know,

1783
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,790
for people like when you're,
if you're a star,

1784
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:26,890
you get calls that like you have an 
offer,

1785
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:28,360
right?
Like you want this off,

1786
01:15:28,361 --> 01:15:31,060
do you want to do this movie?
But if you're just working,

1787
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:33,910
trying to get booked,
you get these emails.

1788
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:36,910
Usually it's an email followed by a call
that says like a,

1789
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:39,520
for your consideration,
um,

1790
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:42,980
movies called family.
Uh,

1791
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:45,460
sean and there's,
John Morris wrote it.

1792
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:46,770
It's uh,
you know,

1793
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:49,090
the part is russ and it has like all 
the,

1794
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:52,390
you know,
mark walberg agreed to play this in rose

1795
01:15:52,391 --> 01:15:55,180
byrne is attached to play this and then 
here's the sides.

1796
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,910
And it was like one of those things 
where it'll say,

1797
01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:01,030
you know,
so thursday at 11,

1798
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:02,020
15:00
AM,

1799
01:16:02,021 --> 01:16:05,620
you are confirmed for the audition and I
get that email like on a monday.

1800
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,930
And I was like,
I just got back from the road,

1801
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,970
I'll say I've got a podcast today.
I was like,

1802
01:16:09,971 --> 01:16:10,804
whatever.
And then I just don't even read any of 

1803
01:16:12,371 --> 01:16:13,470
it.
So then it's like,

1804
01:16:13,471 --> 01:16:14,304
you know,
tuesday and then something happens and 

1805
01:16:15,491 --> 01:16:18,340
we're busy at the house and then went 
and then they go here,

1806
01:16:18,341 --> 01:16:22,690
we're just following up that you're good
for the audition tomorrow.

1807
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:24,670
I get that like on wednesday,
you know,

1808
01:16:24,671 --> 01:16:27,430
just confirming that you'll be there.
And I were like,

1809
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:29,500
nah,
like that's a pass,

1810
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:31,810
like I'm not going to be there.
And that was it.

1811
01:16:31,811 --> 01:16:34,240
I just sent that off.
Like I'm just not doing that this week.

1812
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:37,670
And then I get a call right away and 
it's my agent,

1813
01:16:37,690 --> 01:16:38,441
he's like,
hey,

1814
01:16:38,441 --> 01:16:39,274
uh,
I noticed that you trying to make money 

1815
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:41,293
off.

1816
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,470
I noticed that you're not going to,
you said no.

1817
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:46,150
Is there a reason?
Did the,

1818
01:16:46,151 --> 01:16:47,380
uh,
what did they say?

1819
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:50,230
There's always that phrase,
did you respond to the site?

1820
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,440
Did you not respond to the material,
the material?

1821
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:54,851
And I go,
oh,

1822
01:16:54,851 --> 01:16:57,220
I haven't even read it.
And they go,

1823
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,280
well why aren't you reading it?
I was like,

1824
01:17:00,281 --> 01:17:02,080
because and I just kind of lay out my 
week.

1825
01:17:02,110 --> 01:17:03,070
I'm like,
I've had this,

1826
01:17:03,071 --> 01:17:04,990
I've had this with my kid,
I traveled,

1827
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:07,270
I'm doing this.
I just got a lot going on.

1828
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:08,770
And they're like,
he's like,

1829
01:17:08,771 --> 01:17:09,321
okay,
I go.

1830
01:17:09,321 --> 01:17:10,670
So like,
it's not personal.

1831
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:13,910
I think like he's taking it personal.
I go,

1832
01:17:13,911 --> 01:17:17,390
I'm not saying no to upset you,
I just have these things.

1833
01:17:17,710 --> 01:17:18,740
And he's like,
okay,

1834
01:17:18,741 --> 01:17:23,741
well the director specifically requested
that you audition and like,

1835
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:27,530
as you know,
that doesn't happen a lot with you.

1836
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:31,280
So like do you want to reconsider?
And I was like,

1837
01:17:31,281 --> 01:17:32,114
yeah,
hold on.

1838
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:33,920
I go.
He asked me,

1839
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:35,480
he's asking for me to be like,
yeah,

1840
01:17:35,481 --> 01:17:36,314
and I go,
did you believe him or did you think it 

1841
01:17:37,731 --> 01:17:39,200
was relating you?
I did.

1842
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:41,960
I did believe him because I mean he's 
never said that.

1843
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:42,823
And um,
you know,

1844
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:43,663
a lot of times I've done things with 
like the producers are in the room on 

1845
01:17:45,531 --> 01:17:48,530
this session or that stuff.
And I go,

1846
01:17:48,531 --> 01:17:49,640
okay,
well here's the deal man.

1847
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:50,503
I'm not going to go in unprepared.
So because now it's like the auditions 

1848
01:17:53,511 --> 01:17:56,150
in 24 hours,
so I go,

1849
01:17:56,570 --> 01:17:57,403
I'll do it,
but you have to buy me a couple more 

1850
01:17:58,971 --> 01:18:02,420
days because I'm like,
I have this the rest of today,

1851
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:04,520
like I'm not going to do it tomorrow 
morning.

1852
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:05,990
And he was like,
okay,

1853
01:18:05,991 --> 01:18:06,860
I'll see what I can do.

1854
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,360
And then he called me back.
He's like,

1855
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:10,730
they said they're good for monday or 
whatever,

1856
01:18:10,731 --> 01:18:11,564
and I was like,
great.

1857
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,630
So and then I,
then I tried to prepare for that,

1858
01:18:14,631 --> 01:18:16,070
like,
you know,

1859
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,750
because they told me the director 
requests.

1860
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,560
I was like,
I can't go into this thing half fast.

1861
01:18:21,561 --> 01:18:22,394
So then I'm like really trying to 
prepare for that and then I go in there 

1862
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:27,680
and it was you,
you're on skype.

1863
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:28,783
well okay,
so here's what happened from my end 

1864
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:32,150
because you didn't show up.
Show up.

1865
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,273
I had to go back to atlanta.
And so then we had to do the audition 

1866
01:18:38,331 --> 01:18:39,630
via skype.
What I see,

1867
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:41,120
I didn't know that.
That's brutaL for it.

1868
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:43,490
Everybody else,
because you didn't show up,

1869
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:44,333
but who organize it?
What kind of nonsense agency are you 

1870
01:18:47,481 --> 01:18:50,150
with that they booked you something and 
don't tell you that they book?

1871
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:51,013
well,
they always do that where they'll just 

1872
01:18:51,951 --> 01:18:52,640
book it.
No,

1873
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,300
they'll,
they'll,

1874
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:55,700
they'll set up a time,
right?

1875
01:18:55,701 --> 01:18:58,380
Like it's very common.
will they'll go 11:00

1876
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:00,170
AM 11:00
AM your agency?

1877
01:19:00,171 --> 01:19:01,004
Yes.
Now they must have nothing to do with 

1878
01:19:02,421 --> 01:19:04,700
your podcast then nothing.
That's the problem,

1879
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:05,150
right?
Yeah.

1880
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:05,983
So they don't know what you're booking.
So they just think that that takes 

1881
01:19:08,421 --> 01:19:09,770
precedent.
They also will be like,

1882
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:10,633
hey,
you have an audition friday and I'm 

1883
01:19:11,571 --> 01:19:12,404
like,
when I'm in philadelphia and they're 

1884
01:19:13,911 --> 01:19:14,930
like,
you're in philadelphia.

1885
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:17,940
Is there any way you can move that 
agency for your standup as well?

1886
01:19:18,410 --> 01:19:20,600
Oh christ.
Is there any way you can move that?

1887
01:19:20,850 --> 01:19:22,660
They really fucking say that.
Oh yeah.

1888
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:26,240
They had an agent tell you,
let me call these 5,000

1889
01:19:26,241 --> 01:19:28,130
people that are waiting.
I had an agent,

1890
01:19:28,131 --> 01:19:29,210
I had an agent go,
like,

1891
01:19:29,211 --> 01:19:30,320
why don't you just,
um,

1892
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:33,140
oh,
it was about like bookings on booking.

1893
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:34,610
And I was like,
when does it shoot though?

1894
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:36,350
Like if I booked this,
when does it shoot?

1895
01:19:36,351 --> 01:19:38,390
And it was like this,
you know,

1896
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:40,040
October 3rd or whatever.
I'm like,

1897
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:42,050
oh,
but I'm in sacramento.

1898
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:44,180
And he was like,
just move that.

1899
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:45,710
And I was like,
yeah,

1900
01:19:45,711 --> 01:19:49,160
but it's to theater shows.
It's like 5,000

1901
01:19:49,161 --> 01:19:50,330
people.
And he was like,

1902
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:51,560
oh really?
I'm like,

1903
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,240
yeah,
like you think I just got to.

1904
01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:54,950
Yeah,
just move It aside.

1905
01:19:54,951 --> 01:19:55,731
And he's like,
I'm like,

1906
01:19:55,731 --> 01:19:58,160
why don't you know that my calendar is 
public?

1907
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:01,580
Just look it up man.
But yeah,

1908
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:04,280
they'll give you answers like that.
So she quit acting.

1909
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:07,380
It's should make this movie,

1910
01:20:07,381 --> 01:20:08,010

01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,060
swan song,

1912
01:20:09,210 --> 01:20:12,090
A lot of people are saying it's the 
breakout performance of the year.

1913
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:15,120
I don't know if You've heard of crackle,

If they do whatever they do.

1919
01:20:25,651 --> 01:20:27,030
his standup,
I was like,

1920
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:28,103
this guy is perfect because we want this
guy to just have this kind of swagger 

1921
01:20:31,021 --> 01:20:31,854
and this confidence.
But he can kind of say these jackasses 

1922
01:20:33,530 --> 01:20:34,910
things,
but just sort of own them.

1923
01:20:34,911 --> 01:20:35,910
and I'm like,
this guy,

1924
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:36,773
this guy's perfect for this.
I keep saying this guy because I didn't 

1925
01:20:38,491 --> 01:20:39,990
know him at the time.
And uh,

1926
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,990
so tom comes in and I watched the skype 
audition,

1927
01:20:42,991 --> 01:20:45,360
now I'm going to shit talk you a little 
bit here and a.

1928
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:49,640
And he was not good.
He was so not like,

1929
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:51,240
like who he is.

1930
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:54,480
Like he came in and he kind of was like 
sort of putting us back into it a little

1931
01:20:54,481 --> 01:20:55,314
bit.
Like he was kind of like really just 

1932
01:20:56,011 --> 01:20:56,844
trying to be kind of like really sort of
extra funny and it was just not at all 

1933
01:21:00,421 --> 01:21:02,340
what I had in mind,
but I just was like,

1934
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:04,440
so I,
so I'm watching it skype and I'm just.

1935
01:21:04,441 --> 01:21:05,610
So I'm,
I'm trying to give,

1936
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:06,503
you know,
somebody that you weren't good and I 

1937
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:10,060
have,
I had no idea what,

1938
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:10,930
what,
whether it.

1939
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:12,450
Here's the thing,
everY audition,

1940
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:13,373
this is actually fascinating if you 
audition because you literally leave 

1941
01:21:16,951 --> 01:21:19,410
auditions and you go,
sometimes you go,

1942
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:22,980
that was great and you'll never hear 
anything again.

1943
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:25,230
Sometimes you go,
I bombed,

1944
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:27,000
and you get a call.
Hey,

1945
01:21:27,001 --> 01:21:28,140
guess what?
They want to see you again.

1946
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:30,240
Are you like,
you don't know what they want?

1947
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,800
No idea.
You have no idea.

1948
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:34,170
I don't really know what they want when 
you're going in.

1949
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,480
I did not know that.
It sucked that bad.

1950
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:39,620
I didn't know that.
It didn't know it wasn't that it that it

1951
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:42,330
sucked that bad it.
It might've been.

1952
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:43,253
No,
no it wasn't.

1953
01:21:43,810 --> 01:21:45,270
No,
it was just that you,

1954
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,113
you have this very specific thing that 
you do that I wanted to bring in and be 

1955
01:21:51,541 --> 01:21:53,760
a part of this character.
And you left that out.

1956
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:55,050
See I.
But I don't think.

1957
01:21:55,070 --> 01:21:57,570
What's that thing?
It's like he's got this,

1958
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:00,780
he's got this in his delivery.
This kind of devil may care.

1959
01:22:00,781 --> 01:22:03,290
Kind of like dead pan sort of,
but it's this,

1960
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:04,160
but it's,
it's,

1961
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,810
it's like a big part of your persona is 
this whole like,

1962
01:22:06,811 --> 01:22:07,644
all right,
whatever.

1963
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:09,360
I just said that.
okay.

1964
01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:11,430
And I,
I wanted russ to have that thing.

1965
01:22:11,431 --> 01:22:13,650
And when you came into to audition,
you left that thing out.

1966
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:16,350
I think I did that in the movie.
Not at all.

1967
01:22:16,351 --> 01:22:17,400
No.
You were great in the movie.

1968
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:18,323
No,
I'm saying I feel like I did the movie 

1969
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,840
exactly how I audition.
No,

1970
01:22:21,841 --> 01:22:25,320
you didn't at all really know.
It was like night and day.

1971
01:22:25,370 --> 01:22:26,370
Really.
Night and day.

1972
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,690
In my mind if you,
if someone were to ask me,

1973
01:22:30,691 --> 01:22:31,524
I'd be like 100 percent of the sentence.
the second audition you did just like 

1974
01:22:34,861 --> 01:22:35,730
the movie.
Really?

1975
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:37,650
Yeah.
Because basically so,

1976
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:40,770
so then what happened is we got together
and I thought and I was like,

1977
01:22:40,771 --> 01:22:41,604
god,
I don't want to meet him for the second 

1978
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:43,520
audition.
Well then what?

1979
01:22:43,530 --> 01:22:46,560
We got together because I called them 
because I really wanted him to be at the

1980
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:47,394
movie and I called him and I said,
would you be willing to come over to my 

1981
01:22:49,441 --> 01:22:51,540
house and we can just talk through it 
and work through it.

1982
01:22:51,541 --> 01:22:53,470
A little desk.
That's what harvey weinsteIn shit.

1983
01:22:54,030 --> 01:22:54,863
I made jokes about that.
I made jokes about that immediately to 

1984
01:22:57,031 --> 01:22:58,050
him on the phone.
I was like,

1985
01:22:58,051 --> 01:22:59,970
am I going to give you a bath?
He was like,

1986
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:05,120
all right,
can I tell you I got to go back.

1987
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:07,203
This is more embarrassing.
I remember leaving that audition that 

1988
01:23:10,301 --> 01:23:11,134
now you're telling me this,
the first one and tell my agent like 

1989
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:17,350
there's no way I could've done better.
I did tell him that.

1990
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:19,120
I was like,
there's no.

1991
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,120
I could not.
I don't,

1992
01:23:20,121 --> 01:23:21,670
I can't imagine.
Dude,

1993
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,980
I'm serious.
That's the thing.

1994
01:23:23,981 --> 01:23:24,814
I,
I understand that because you have 

1995
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:29,320
energy and you were funny,
but you just didn't have that thing that

1996
01:23:29,321 --> 01:23:31,690
I wanted so badly to be a part of this 
character.

1997
01:23:31,950 --> 01:23:33,670
And,
and so it was,

1998
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:34,533
there was this one thing that was 
missing and then you came over and we 

1999
01:23:36,791 --> 01:23:39,940
talked about it and then you did it.
And then also we got the chance to.

2000
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:41,380
Because we didn't,
when he read it,

2001
01:23:41,381 --> 01:23:44,590
he's just reading dialogue that we wrote
for anybody.

2002
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:45,663
But then once you,
once you have somebody's voice in your 

2003
01:23:46,871 --> 01:23:47,704
head a little bit,
you can adjust it and make it a little 

2004
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:49,774
more comfortable.

2005
01:23:49,910 --> 01:23:50,650
So we,
we,

2006
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:51,483
we made some adjustments to the dialogue
and everything which made it more 

2007
01:23:53,921 --> 01:23:57,370
conducive to your style of speaking 
cadence.

2008
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:57,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

2009
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:58,990
That was fun.
And uh,

2010
01:23:58,991 --> 01:23:59,711
yeah,
it was.

2011
01:23:59,711 --> 01:24:00,544
And so then he comes back and he does it
again and he crushed it and he was 

2012
01:24:03,641 --> 01:24:06,160
really funny and we sent that to the 
studio and they were like,

2013
01:24:06,161 --> 01:24:07,570
oh my god,
this guy's great.

2014
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:10,660
And it was like such a no idea.
I have no idea.

2015
01:24:10,661 --> 01:24:13,840
That's kind of what I wanted to talk 
about this on the podcast because I knew

2016
01:24:13,841 --> 01:24:15,640
you didn't know all.
I definitely didn't know that.

2017
01:24:15,730 --> 01:24:17,910
I definitely didn't know that.
It's actually like,

2018
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:19,540
it's,
it's the thing though,

2019
01:24:19,870 --> 01:24:20,703
like if that's the big bummer about in 
general auditioning is you walk out and 

2020
01:24:24,731 --> 01:24:25,564
you go,
sometimes you follow up with your agent 

2021
01:24:27,441 --> 01:24:28,171
and you're like,
what?

2022
01:24:28,171 --> 01:24:29,080
So what's the feedback?

2023
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:29,760
And they're like,
ah,

2024
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:30,460
they look,
they always,

2025
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:32,320
they always tell you they loved you and 
you're like,

2026
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:35,380
is there anything else you don't know?
Like was it good,

2027
01:24:35,381 --> 01:24:36,214
was it bad?
And you also don't know what they're 

2028
01:24:36,881 --> 01:24:38,440
looking for.
And I don't know.

2029
01:24:38,441 --> 01:24:42,220
I mean go into your place.
I'm going over like,

2030
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:44,860
you know,
in detail more is also like,

2031
01:24:44,861 --> 01:24:45,694
I actually felt like I won a contest 
because you audition now I know I 

2032
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:50,584
tanked.
And then the directors like do you want 

2033
01:24:52,181 --> 01:24:55,690
to come work on it so that like possibly
you can do it better?

2034
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:57,690
And I was like sure man.
So I'm,

2035
01:24:57,710 --> 01:25:00,810
I'm working with him on this thing and I
don't know,

2036
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:06,040
we spent a lot of time working on it and
then when I found out I booked the role,

2037
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:06,903
then I go there and I feel like it's a 
second part of the contest because like 

2038
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:14,170
he has all great actors in the movie.

2039
01:25:14,170 --> 01:25:16,060
Like for all of the parts.
I mean you know the stars,

2040
01:25:16,061 --> 01:25:19,150
but like margo martindale from the 
american.

2041
01:25:19,151 --> 01:25:21,910
You're watching americans know that 
shows.

2042
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:23,450
You've seen her though.
She's amazing.

2043
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:25,330
She's amazing.
She's one heard that shows awesome.

2044
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:27,460
That shows so good.
I mean it just ended.

2045
01:25:27,461 --> 01:25:30,310
But like if you ever want to go on a 
binge weekend,

2046
01:25:30,311 --> 01:25:33,400
now you have like six seasons I think to
go through and she,

2047
01:25:33,410 --> 01:25:35,590
I,
I became a big fan of hers on that.

2048
01:25:35,591 --> 01:25:38,740
And then julie haggerty and you have 
like all these great actors.

2049
01:25:38,741 --> 01:25:43,060
So every time spencer take notaro we had
like really good.

2050
01:25:43,090 --> 01:25:46,960
Every time we're shooting a scene with 
one of the,

2051
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:47,843
with one of them,
I ended up just watching them like I'm 

2052
01:25:51,161 --> 01:25:52,870
in the scene and I'm just like,
wow,

2053
01:25:52,871 --> 01:25:55,870
she's a really good actor.
That's weird,

2054
01:25:55,871 --> 01:25:56,450
isn't it?
Yeah,

2055
01:25:56,450 --> 01:25:57,283
totally is.
I did a scene with maura tierney once 

2056
01:25:59,051 --> 01:25:59,884
when I was on newsradio.
Maura tierney is definitely one of the 

2057
01:26:02,081 --> 01:26:02,914
best actors I've ever worked with,
but she was so good that she did the 

2058
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:08,360
law.
We're were rehearsing,

2059
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:09,223
doing all this things.
She did the lion in the scene and I 

2060
01:26:10,641 --> 01:26:13,370
didn't realize that it was the lion from
the scene.

2061
01:26:13,371 --> 01:26:14,204
I realized she was just talking.
I thought she was just talking because 

2062
01:26:16,611 --> 01:26:18,830
of how like she's so natural.
I was like,

2063
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:20,840
that kind of creeped me out.
I was like,

2064
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:21,740
oh,
oh,

2065
01:26:21,741 --> 01:26:22,574
that's the line.

2066
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:26,050
That was weird.
yeah,

2067
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:28,750
totally normal.
Right?

2068
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:29,723
Because otherwise people like tom,
where are we going to find a guy that's 

2069
01:26:32,871 --> 01:26:35,290
going to fix that?
So forth.

2070
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:40,010
She had none of that because she was 
really an actor before she was.

2071
01:26:40,011 --> 01:26:43,310
I would just say some of them don't like
to be called actresses.

2072
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:43,970
Right?
yeah.

2073
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:44,803
So it's safer to say actor,
but it comics could see who the fuck 

2074
01:26:48,591 --> 01:26:51,620
uses comedian remember that?
That went away.

2075
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:53,330
I didn't know that doesn't exist 
anymore.

2076
01:26:53,331 --> 01:26:57,040
You know about the latin x thing.
I didn't know that was the thing.

2077
01:26:57,210 --> 01:26:58,460
We didn't know about that.
What do you mean?

2078
01:26:58,830 --> 01:27:03,830
I was reading this article and yeah,
it's and latina are male and female.

2079
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:08,360
Gender specific.
So the,

2080
01:27:08,530 --> 01:27:13,530
And the word latin also get,
gets it done as far as.

2081
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:15,240
Yeah,
I dunno.

2082
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:16,253
Yeah.
So it's supposed to be like that's how 

2083
01:27:17,481 --> 01:27:18,314
you latin x,
you should say that you're supposed to 

2084
01:27:19,791 --> 01:27:23,930
say latinex because it's just new.

2085
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:25,133
It's not,
it's a couple years in the making and 

2086
01:27:27,591 --> 01:27:29,540
fuck off.
We'll see in spanish.

2087
01:27:29,541 --> 01:27:32,360
the masculinized version of these words 
just considered gender neutral,

2088
01:27:32,361 --> 01:27:34,700
but that obviously doesn't work for some
of us like myself.

2089
01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:35,803
And so I think it's appropriate to 
assign a masculinity as gender neutral 

2090
01:27:39,771 --> 01:27:40,604
when it isn't.
So I'm latinex well it's interesting 

2091
01:27:42,561 --> 01:27:43,394
because my kids are latin and this is 
another one of the things that we touch 

2092
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:47,980
on to next.
Yeah,

2093
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:50,150
there it is and we touch it.
Oh,

2094
01:27:50,151 --> 01:27:50,571
sorry,
go ahead.

2095
01:27:50,571 --> 01:27:50,961
No,
go ahead,

2096
01:27:50,961 --> 01:27:51,351
please.
Well,

2097
01:27:51,351 --> 01:27:55,280
we touch on this a little,
not this pronunciation or you know,

2098
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:59,690
but we touch on that a little bit in the
movie of there is that feeling,

2099
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:00,280
you know,
when,

2100
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:03,200
when we went in to adopt our kids,
we were just open.

2101
01:28:03,201 --> 01:28:04,070
We were like,
look,

2102
01:28:04,071 --> 01:28:05,030
we're,
we're,

2103
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:10,100
we're pretty general age wise,
we didn't go in expecting three kids.

2104
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:11,091
Just,
you know,

2105
01:28:11,091 --> 01:28:13,220
we thought one and it sort of turned 
into that.

2106
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:14,900
But uh,
but you know,

2107
01:28:14,901 --> 01:28:17,450
you're open to it and you're just there 
and they ask you,

2108
01:28:17,451 --> 01:28:18,650
well,
what about ethnIcity?

2109
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:20,210
You know,
and just go,

2110
01:28:20,390 --> 01:28:21,620
yeah,
whatever,

2111
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:23,360
you know,
wherever the need is,

2112
01:28:23,830 --> 01:28:27,380
whoever needs parents let us know.
And,

2113
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:30,600
but then when,
when it happens and your kids in my,

2114
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,660
in my case,
my kids turned out to be latin,

2115
01:28:32,930 --> 01:28:35,260
then you have the,
you know,

2116
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:37,250
you start to kind of think about like,
oh,

2117
01:28:37,251 --> 01:28:38,390
well,
you know,

2118
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:39,403
uh,
is that,

2119
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:40,670
is that okay?
Is that gonna?

2120
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:42,620
Is that gonna look like the white savior
thing?

2121
01:28:42,621 --> 01:28:44,560
Is that going to look weird?
Is that am I,

2122
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:46,430
am I saying things right?
And whatever.

2123
01:28:46,431 --> 01:28:50,000
And what ends up happening is this 
really wonderful thing where your family

2124
01:28:50,001 --> 01:28:52,490
becomes this melting pot where,
you know,

2125
01:28:52,491 --> 01:28:54,040
at first,
because of the,

2126
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:56,630
the,
the times that we live in right now,

2127
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:57,583
it is,
it's a little scary jumping into that 

2128
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:02,100
because thinking about what you know,
but you're,

2129
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:03,193
you know,
but you ultimately are just going to 

2130
01:29:03,841 --> 01:29:04,674
think about who the kids are,
what their need is and how wonderful 

2131
01:29:09,031 --> 01:29:11,670
they are and,
but you.

2132
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:12,533
But all of those things come up and 
that's the kind of thing that wouldn't 

2133
01:29:14,581 --> 01:29:15,810
even be,
you know,

2134
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:16,733
why would that the,
the latinex thing have anything to do 

2135
01:29:20,131 --> 01:29:21,480
with my house.
Well now it does.

2136
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:22,560
Yeah.
So I've got,

2137
01:29:22,970 --> 01:29:24,300
I've got all that,
you know,

2138
01:29:24,301 --> 01:29:25,260
all the time.
And,

2139
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:26,123
and uh,
I actually find it really interesting 

2140
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:28,910
latinex thing.
No,

2141
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:30,570
no,
not that specifically,

2142
01:29:30,571 --> 01:29:31,404
but just that,
that my family is now this little 

2143
01:29:33,331 --> 01:29:34,260
melting pot.
Yeah,

2144
01:29:34,261 --> 01:29:35,520
that part's cool.
And it's cool.

2145
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:37,590
I reject latinex completely.
Well,

2146
01:29:37,591 --> 01:29:38,490
it is,
it is cool.

2147
01:29:38,491 --> 01:29:40,800
But it's also very strange that that is 
a.

2148
01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:41,683
And it would be a real point of concern,
like you would worry about how do I 

2149
01:29:45,451 --> 01:29:50,070
handle this new culture without cultural
appropriation,

2150
01:29:50,071 --> 01:29:50,904
how do I,
how do I bring my kid and embrace the 

2151
01:29:54,211 --> 01:29:56,910
latino or latina culture?
Like what do I,

2152
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:57,960
how do I handle that?

2153
01:29:58,020 --> 01:29:58,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

2154
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:01,160
And how do we do it without getting 
called a racist?

2155
01:30:01,161 --> 01:30:01,994
Right.
And it gets back to what I was talking 

2156
01:30:02,941 --> 01:30:07,890
about before where you're trying to just
put your kids' needs first and just deal

2157
01:30:07,891 --> 01:30:10,260
with them as children,
as individuals,

2158
01:30:10,261 --> 01:30:11,520
as human beings,
you know,

2159
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,160
and,
but at the same time you're also,

2160
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:15,113
you're with other parents and there's in
the adoption community and really in 

2161
01:30:18,721 --> 01:30:19,554
every direction,
there's mixed race families and the 

2162
01:30:21,451 --> 01:30:25,530
adoption community and uh,
and you're kind of learning from them.

2163
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:27,150
And it just,
I don't know,

2164
01:30:27,151 --> 01:30:27,984
it just,
it opens up a lot of conversations with 

2165
01:30:29,641 --> 01:30:32,010
your own kids and,
and just the movies.

2166
01:30:32,011 --> 01:30:34,610
You watch the foods you eat sometimes.
And I,

2167
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:35,790
I don't,
I think it's great.

2168
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:36,331
No,
it's great.

2169
01:30:36,331 --> 01:30:37,360
I think it's really,
you know,

2170
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:37,771
the,
uh,

2171
01:30:37,771 --> 01:30:39,060
the language thing,
for me,

2172
01:30:39,061 --> 01:30:41,890
it stands out more because my whole life
I've said latIno,

2173
01:30:41,891 --> 01:30:46,200
like my mother's latina and it's just 
funny to me to speak spanish.

2174
01:30:46,230 --> 01:30:47,063
He speaks fluently,
which is hilarious because tom has some 

2175
01:30:49,441 --> 01:30:50,274
great stories about people not thinking 
he speaks spanish because when you look 

2176
01:30:53,521 --> 01:30:54,151
at them you're like,
oh,

2177
01:30:54,151 --> 01:30:57,630
this fucking american guy.
It looks like a regular american guy.

2178
01:30:57,930 --> 01:30:58,763
but he speaks perfect.
I've been around him before when he 

2179
01:31:01,351 --> 01:31:02,370
asked people questions,
like,

2180
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:03,750
oh,
I forgot you could do that.

2181
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:04,560
Yeah,
yeah.

2182
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:05,640
It's like someone who,
you know,

2183
01:31:05,641 --> 01:31:07,390
they could do backflips,
right?

2184
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:08,630
Just do a backflip,
be like,

2185
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:09,660
oh,
I forgot you could do that.

2186
01:31:09,930 --> 01:31:10,531
Yeah,
it's true.

2187
01:31:10,531 --> 01:31:14,880
And that throw it throws people off 
because you look so american.

2188
01:31:14,881 --> 01:31:15,691
Yeah.
And that,

2189
01:31:15,691 --> 01:31:16,524
you mean you look like a guy.
I mean if you have a guy who loves 

2190
01:31:19,051 --> 01:31:21,840
football,
like it's still fucking american,

2191
01:31:21,841 --> 01:31:24,120
a regular american,
but he speaks perfect.

2192
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:25,980
He rOlls the.
When you go.

2193
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:29,280
Even when I travel abroad to spanish 
speaking countries,

2194
01:31:29,310 --> 01:31:30,143
even there,
even though spanish speaking countries 

2195
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:36,420
are also melting pot different,
they still look at you like,

2196
01:31:36,570 --> 01:31:38,810
oh shit,
look at this motherfucker.

2197
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:44,260
It's really throws people at the most.
The craziest one wasn't even with me and

2198
01:31:44,451 --> 01:31:45,284
my sister who,
one of my sisters who also speak 

2199
01:31:47,051 --> 01:31:48,150
spanish,
uh,

2200
01:31:48,151 --> 01:31:51,750
went to the naval academy's linguistics 
center,

2201
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:52,663
so in the navy and she was in the navy 
for awhile and she learned mandarin and 

2202
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,130
it was really,
really

2203
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:03,730
intense.
And we went to a restaurant together and

2204
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:04,713
the guy who was one of those,
like a benihana tight where they chop 

2205
01:32:07,691 --> 01:32:08,524
stuff up and the guy was a,
someone asked like where he's from and 

2206
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:17,230
he said somewhere in China and she 
started speaking mandarin and he dropped

2207
01:32:17,231 --> 01:32:18,064
the thing and he was like,
he saw a ghost and she's spitting back 

2208
01:32:22,961 --> 01:32:26,920
to them and pretty fluent mandarin and 
he stops.

2209
01:32:26,921 --> 01:32:29,200
And he was like,
I've never seen this before.

2210
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:31,600
And he's like,
I've never seen a white person do this.

2211
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:32,980
And we were like,
yeah,

2212
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:34,173
pretty,
pretty wild.

2213
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:35,410
And then he turned us.
He goes,

2214
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:38,080
I don't think you understand how hard it
is to speak this language,

2215
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,760
and I was like,
I have a pretty good idea,

2216
01:32:39,790 --> 01:32:40,623
I can't do it.

2217
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:45,220
And then just watching it,
he was just like,

2218
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:48,820
he couldn't even start cooking except 
your sister to learn.

2219
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,950
Um,
well she was in.

2220
01:32:50,951 --> 01:32:51,784
When you sign,
when you get into like that naval 

2221
01:32:53,771 --> 01:32:56,560
institute program,
they have you going,

2222
01:32:57,370 --> 01:33:00,250
I think it was something like eight 
hours a day,

2223
01:33:00,310 --> 01:33:03,220
five or six days a week.
So it's really,

2224
01:33:03,221 --> 01:33:05,710
it's super into,
it's almost like learning mandarin.

2225
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:08,200
Yeah.
And it overwhelms people.

2226
01:33:08,201 --> 01:33:11,800
People drop out almost like in a 
physical stress way,

2227
01:33:11,801 --> 01:33:12,634
you know,
some people just can't handle the camp 

2228
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:17,180
like bootcamp and I forget how long she 
was in and you know,

2229
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:22,200
she didn't reach the level of I'm super 
fluent,

2230
01:33:22,631 --> 01:33:23,464
like we're speaking english,
but she was able to communicate in 

2231
01:33:26,381 --> 01:33:27,670
mandarin.
Can she read it?

2232
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:29,373
She was reading and writing.
That's the thing is she was telling me 

2233
01:33:30,551 --> 01:33:33,490
one time about how many characters and 
you know,

2234
01:33:33,491 --> 01:33:34,324
it was just unbelievable and like 
there's sounds for expressions like I'm 

2235
01:33:37,871 --> 01:33:39,190
going to screw up [inaudible] I don't 
remember it,

2236
01:33:39,191 --> 01:33:41,740
but she was like,
you can do something like,

2237
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:42,603
oh,
and that means like means an actual 

2238
01:33:46,211 --> 01:33:47,640
phrase,
you know,

2239
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:50,240
like there's so many and that,
uh,

2240
01:33:50,450 --> 01:33:54,820
that there's characters that mean entire
expressions as well,

2241
01:33:54,821 --> 01:33:55,780
that I was like,
this is just,

2242
01:33:55,930 --> 01:34:00,930
our brains are so married to our 
alphabet and way of speaking that it's a

2243
01:34:01,181 --> 01:34:03,850
real jump to,
to learn that,

2244
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:04,880
you know,
it's just,

2245
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:05,793
it really is fascinating when you travel
and you listen to people speaking their 

2246
01:34:08,590 --> 01:34:13,590
native tongue and you realize how 
strangely different languages are across

2247
01:34:13,841 --> 01:34:14,674
the entire planet.

2248
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:16,113
Just unbelievable.
I was in Thailand thIs summer and you 

2249
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:19,930
listen to people talk,
tie and everything.

2250
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:24,100
Everything stretches.
It's got like a stretch to it,

2251
01:34:24,370 --> 01:34:25,510
you know,
it's like a weird.

2252
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:28,690
It's very odd language.
I'm like,

2253
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:34,020
compare that to like german or dutch,
like the germans got those hard sounding

2254
01:34:35,741 --> 01:34:36,574
really hard.

2255
01:34:38,530 --> 01:34:40,990
it's like this weird difference.
Yeah.

2256
01:34:40,991 --> 01:34:43,120
And the latin one,
latin root word,

2257
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:48,150
like languages all do have a flowy 
singing sounds kind of nice to listen to

2258
01:34:48,890 --> 01:34:50,230
the language.
That's really nice.

2259
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:52,660
I've met like listening.
I don't speak portuguese.

2260
01:34:52,661 --> 01:34:53,890
I like listening to it.
Yeah,

2261
01:34:53,891 --> 01:34:57,100
brazilian portuguese is amazing.
Sounds so cool.

2262
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:59,210
And I listened to.
We listened to french music sometimes at

2263
01:34:59,211 --> 01:35:00,590
home.
Just in the kitchen.

2264
01:35:00,591 --> 01:35:00,981
Yeah.
Yeah.

2265
01:35:00,981 --> 01:35:02,480
Like cooking or something.
I don't know.

2266
01:35:02,481 --> 01:35:04,730
What the hell are you saying?
I like it when I write.

2267
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:05,653
I listen to spanish music when I write 
because I have no idea what they're 

2268
01:35:08,211 --> 01:35:09,044
saying.
I did that to you listen to music in a 

2269
01:35:10,851 --> 01:35:12,680
foreign language so that it doesn't.
It doesn't.

2270
01:35:12,681 --> 01:35:13,710
It doesn't distract.
Yeah.

2271
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:14,630
Yeah.
Yeah.

2272
01:35:14,631 --> 01:35:15,830
It's like,
it sounds good.

2273
01:35:15,831 --> 01:35:17,060
It gives me a little something,
something.

2274
01:35:17,061 --> 01:35:19,550
But I can still think about the exact 
things that I'm thinking about.

2275
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:20,413
Well,
I recently had this interesting 

2276
01:35:21,171 --> 01:35:23,060
experience.
I sent you one of them that,

2277
01:35:23,090 --> 01:35:25,770
you know,
the trailers for the movie get a.

2278
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:26,693
Oh yeah.
The movie itself and the trailers get 

2279
01:35:28,581 --> 01:35:30,350
dubbed into all kinds of different 
languages.

2280
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:31,333
So you have this dialogue that,
that I wrote or meeting town road or 

2281
01:35:34,611 --> 01:35:35,444
whatever,
and you get to hear it in these 

2282
01:35:36,861 --> 01:35:37,694
different languages and I sent you the 
Spain spanish because that's different 

2283
01:35:41,061 --> 01:35:41,894
and I don't really,
I'm not going to pretend that I 

2284
01:35:42,801 --> 01:35:44,720
understand that much.
What the difference between the,

2285
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:47,000
between it is.
But that's predominantlY what you speak,

2286
01:35:47,001 --> 01:35:47,780
right?
No,

2287
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:48,810
no it isn't.
No,

2288
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:49,673
not mother What I speak predominantly it
was just like specifically south 

2289
01:35:53,331 --> 01:35:55,730
american and more specifically a 
peruvian.

2290
01:35:56,490 --> 01:35:57,590
Okay.
All right,

2291
01:35:57,620 --> 01:35:58,341
great.
So,

2292
01:35:58,341 --> 01:35:59,174
but I mean I did study,
I studied in madrid for six months and 

2293
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:04,670
once your,
your ears are trained to it,

2294
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,090
you can listen to someone say a sentence
and know that it's,

2295
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:09,050
oh,
that's from Spain.

2296
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:09,810
Like,
that's,

2297
01:36:09,810 --> 01:36:12,200
that's really interesting.
Then there's the cuban version of it,

2298
01:36:12,201 --> 01:36:13,850
which is crazy.
Yeah.

2299
01:36:14,830 --> 01:36:15,663
Version of the way they,
all the island dialects sound 

2300
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:20,000
dramatically different,
you know,

2301
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:23,270
like if you listen to somebody from 
Cuba,

2302
01:36:23,630 --> 01:36:27,500
puerto rico,
is it a comparison like english speakers

2303
01:36:27,530 --> 01:36:29,930
from America versus english speakers 
from Ireland?

2304
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:31,250
[inaudible]?
It is,

2305
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:32,270
yeah.
Um,

2306
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:33,290
and I would say,
you know,

2307
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:37,060
I always think of Spain as like our 
britain,

2308
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:37,933
you know,
in a way like the language properly 

2309
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:43,010
english is from england.
That's where the language,

2310
01:36:43,011 --> 01:36:43,844
that is,
how you speak it spanish and a guest to 

2311
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:51,590
yet castilian that comes from Spain.
They're speaking oji spanish and then it

2312
01:36:52,401 --> 01:36:53,234
all kind of came over here and it's 
influenced and every country has 

2313
01:36:56,630 --> 01:36:58,610
different ways of saying things 
different.

2314
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:00,680
Obviously different slAng,
um,

2315
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:03,830
all different curses,
all different expressions,

2316
01:37:03,890 --> 01:37:04,723
completely different.
Even words like as simple as like to 

2317
01:37:07,041 --> 01:37:08,480
pick up,
you know,

2318
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:10,490
go ahead,
pick something up.

2319
01:37:11,030 --> 01:37:14,960
You know,
you say that in Mexico or Argentina,

2320
01:37:14,961 --> 01:37:17,730
it literally means to fuck.
So really?

2321
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:18,593
Yeah.
So if you're like know cuticle hair 

2322
01:37:19,990 --> 01:37:20,990
style,
like you're trying to,

2323
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:22,730
you're saying like,
I want to fuck this water?

2324
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:27,750
Yeah,
but I'm going to fuck this bottle.

2325
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:31,970
yeah.
My mom told me that she was In a,

2326
01:37:32,510 --> 01:37:33,343
in Argentina,
like when her youth and traveled there 

2327
01:37:35,661 --> 01:37:37,790
and was with a bell hop and she was 
like,

2328
01:37:37,820 --> 01:37:38,653
go ahead man,
I'm on.

2329
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:40,640
Which is like,
pick up that suitcase.

2330
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:41,810
But he was like,
okay,

2331
01:37:41,930 --> 01:37:45,290
because she was basically in slang 
saying fuck my suitcase,

2332
01:37:45,291 --> 01:37:47,480
you know,
so it's just.

2333
01:37:47,481 --> 01:37:48,830
But like,
there's like,

2334
01:37:49,310 --> 01:37:54,080
there's also like severity of words,
like hold aid is the word,

2335
01:37:54,110 --> 01:37:55,650
like there's so many ways to say fuck 
you,

2336
01:37:55,660 --> 01:37:56,730
of course,
in every language.

2337
01:37:57,030 --> 01:38:01,350
But khaled in Spain is like saying fuck.
It's like going like,

2338
01:38:01,351 --> 01:38:02,184
oh fuck.

2339
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:05,070
But like when you say it in Peru,
nomi has,

2340
01:38:05,390 --> 01:38:06,990
it's a,
it's a softer.

2341
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:09,480
It's not taken as severely.
So it's not,

2342
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:14,310
it's not read the same way.
You're not saying you're saying,

2343
01:38:14,330 --> 01:38:15,163
uh,
uh,

2344
01:38:15,290 --> 01:38:17,160
like you're complaining,
but you're like,

2345
01:38:17,161 --> 01:38:17,880
I don't.
It's like,

2346
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:18,900
it's taken as like,
oh,

2347
01:38:18,901 --> 01:38:20,940
don't mess with me,
you know?

2348
01:38:20,970 --> 01:38:22,860
So like,
even when I would say when I would go to

2349
01:38:22,861 --> 01:38:24,240
Spain,
they were like,

2350
01:38:24,241 --> 01:38:25,260
damn,
you curse a lot.

2351
01:38:25,420 --> 01:38:26,370
And I was like,
really?

2352
01:38:26,970 --> 01:38:28,510
And then they,
you know,

2353
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:32,400
we went over that one and then like six 
months later they were like,

2354
01:38:32,401 --> 01:38:33,930
you actually do curse a lot all the 
time.

2355
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:34,741
And I was like,
yeah,

2356
01:38:34,741 --> 01:38:38,220
that's probably right.
Do you do stand up in spanish when you.

2357
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:43,730
I've done bits and stories were like,
I involve both english and spanish,

2358
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:45,053
but I haven't done theirs.
There's a show now I'm here in la that 

2359
01:38:49,531 --> 01:38:53,580
they're doing a thing that even at the 
stores had it like once where,

2360
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:54,473
uh,
some of the spanish speaking comics 

2361
01:38:56,011 --> 01:38:57,400
here,
um,

2362
01:38:57,690 --> 01:39:01,350
have done like a full show in spanish 
here in la.

2363
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:04,380
Francisco ramos of felipe.
I did it as far as uh,

2364
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,500
um,
well,

2365
01:39:06,510 --> 01:39:07,950
what's the other guy?
Torres.

2366
01:39:08,330 --> 01:39:10,540
joey do it.
I don't know if joey did it.

2367
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:11,633
Joe used to do spanglish and in miami he
would do cuban spanish plus english and 

2368
01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:23,740
it was impossible to follow because of 
the audiences were,

2369
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:26,940
there's so many cuban people in the 
audience and he would hit punch lines in

2370
01:39:26,941 --> 01:39:27,774
spanish and people would literally just 
throw chairs through windows and jumped 

2371
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:34,350
through the cla people where he would 
crush.

2372
01:39:34,351 --> 01:39:38,430
So I middled once in miami.
And did you know,

2373
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:41,890
you used every trick and to get through 
the sex.

2374
01:39:41,910 --> 01:39:42,743
It's such a chaotic club because I 
wasn't saying it was totally insane and 

2375
01:39:45,661 --> 01:39:47,850
I was doing stuff and talking to this 
lady.

2376
01:39:47,851 --> 01:39:48,440
I would,
I would,

2377
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:49,273
you know,
I would hit a punchline in spanish and 

2378
01:39:50,461 --> 01:39:52,380
then say something back to this guy's 
spanish,

2379
01:39:52,381 --> 01:39:56,040
then go back to english,
do like your best bit and then something

2380
01:39:56,041 --> 01:39:58,980
else is spanish and it was so crazy for 
me at the time,

2381
01:39:58,981 --> 01:40:02,130
like I never experienced a 20 minute set
like that,

2382
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:03,263
that the guy,
the headline or after we did 35 minutes 

2383
01:40:05,581 --> 01:40:08,760
and split like he was just like a good 
night because it was,

2384
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:09,923
he was a white guy and was like not know
what's happening once they got that 

2385
01:40:13,171 --> 01:40:13,890
flavor.

2386
01:40:13,890 --> 01:40:15,730
Yeah.
Because it was like,

2387
01:40:15,870 --> 01:40:17,940
it's the most.
I mean that,

2388
01:40:17,941 --> 01:40:22,941
that room that didn't hold that many 
people had like 300 I think last I think

2389
01:40:23,701 --> 01:40:24,534
probably less,
maybe like 75 or something and it had 

2390
01:40:26,491 --> 01:40:27,480
like,
you know,

2391
01:40:27,481 --> 01:40:29,430
they were haitians in there,
colombians,

2392
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:31,200
cubans,
puerto rican.

2393
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:34,110
But I mean it was such a mix of people 
and they,

2394
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:35,880
if you start giving them a little bit of
flavor.

2395
01:40:35,890 --> 01:40:36,723
Yeah.
And they let people in there that were 

2396
01:40:37,711 --> 01:40:41,880
like 18 to 18 people in with guns and 
all kinds of people.

2397
01:40:41,890 --> 01:40:46,890
It was a the miami improv.
It was the the worst club to work.

2398
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,680
They're reopening in a new location.
Good luck.

2399
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:50,830
Yeah,
too late.

2400
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:53,160
I dunno.
I know.

2401
01:40:53,290 --> 01:40:54,123
That was a.

2402
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:57,990
What was it that was coconut grove and 
now they're opening I think in doral,

2403
01:40:58,110 --> 01:40:59,770
in miami.
Just so crazy.

2404
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:02,830
It's such an interesting place.
It's so different than any other place.

2405
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:04,113
I did miami right before I did my 
netflix special and they were using 

2406
01:41:06,101 --> 01:41:06,934
those yonder bags.
We had to put your cell phone into 

2407
01:41:08,021 --> 01:41:10,960
yonder bag so you couldn't use it while 
you were inside the store,

2408
01:41:10,990 --> 01:41:11,823
so you know what they did.
You could leave the room and use the 

2409
01:41:14,351 --> 01:41:15,730
yonder bag.
Right.

2410
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:18,520
So these,
the entire set,

2411
01:41:18,550 --> 01:41:21,550
it was the only place where the entire 
set people just kept coming and going.

2412
01:41:21,940 --> 01:41:26,940
They just kept leaving and coming back 
there was so many people doing it and it

2413
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:30,220
might've been like dozens of people at 
any point in time walking around,

2414
01:41:30,221 --> 01:41:31,054
coming and going to,
going outside to get to use their phone 

2415
01:41:33,731 --> 01:41:35,980
and then coming back in like it was 
chaos.

2416
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:37,233
The phone thing.
I don't know that there's a real good 

2417
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:40,623
solution yet,
but I did the yonder thing in new 

2418
01:41:42,191 --> 01:41:46,270
orleans and that place wasn't too big,
but it was,

2419
01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:47,860
it was still.
You could tell like,

2420
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:50,080
you know,
it's inconvenient for them.

2421
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:52,640
It's a,
it's a long thing to go thRough that,

2422
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:55,720
but then you're like,
then you have people coming and going in

2423
01:41:55,721 --> 01:41:58,120
and out of the showroom because they 
want to use their phone.

2424
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:00,910
It's a fucking nightmare,
but if they don't,

2425
01:42:01,210 --> 01:42:04,180
if they just sit there and just tune 
into the show,

2426
01:42:04,210 --> 01:42:05,860
it's great.
It's like 10 percent better.

2427
01:42:05,861 --> 01:42:06,880
I think so too.
Yeah,

2428
01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:08,213
but it's hard.
It's hard to impose that on people too 

2429
01:42:10,510 --> 01:42:12,760
and a surprised when people don't know.
They're like,

2430
01:42:12,761 --> 01:42:15,880
I'm doing what with my phone man.
Going to put it in a bag.

2431
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:16,773
It's still going to be on you and you 
can use it as long as you leave this 

2432
01:42:19,241 --> 01:42:19,930
room.

2433
01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:20,800
They're like,
out of,

2434
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:21,634
no man,
I need to check my phone every 18 

2435
01:42:22,811 --> 01:42:23,820
seconds.
Yeah.

2436
01:42:23,970 --> 01:42:24,803
I had to let people know,
but there's some people that just want 

2437
01:42:26,231 --> 01:42:29,530
to film everything to,
you know when you get on stage,

2438
01:42:29,531 --> 01:42:30,364
you see people just stand there while 
you're doing your set and they're 

2439
01:42:31,691 --> 01:42:34,740
holding a phone up you and you're like,
this is.

2440
01:42:34,870 --> 01:42:36,850
You're making this whole thing so much 
weirder.

2441
01:42:37,010 --> 01:42:38,620
Yeah.
Do you understand what you're doing?

2442
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:41,800
You're basically like a tmz guy at the 
airport,

2443
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:46,200
like they're watching a show,
like holding it up in front of them like

2444
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:48,870
they're not even looking at for comedy 
too.

2445
01:42:49,350 --> 01:42:50,183
I went to of all things a daddy daughter
dance with my daughter and it was the 

2446
01:42:53,861 --> 01:42:54,694
weirdest thing.
Every guy was dancing with their little 

2447
01:42:57,641 --> 01:43:02,641
kids like this and I realized,
I realized that why they were doing it.

2448
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:06,340
It wasn't about the moment,
I mean a little bit,

2449
01:43:06,610 --> 01:43:07,443
but it was more about that that if you 
have that phone out and you're looking 

2450
01:43:09,911 --> 01:43:13,390
at that screen and you're doing that,
it sort of keeps everything else out.

2451
01:43:13,390 --> 01:43:14,223
It makes you feel like you're having 
this little moment instead of having to 

2452
01:43:16,571 --> 01:43:17,404
be this awkward thing of like you're 
dancing in front of these other grown 

2453
01:43:19,481 --> 01:43:21,900
men.
I think it's done.

2454
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:22,743
Honestly.
I think you're just trying to capture 

2455
01:43:23,651 --> 01:43:25,030
these moments.
You know,

2456
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:27,820
you're,
you're painfully aware that they're only

2457
01:43:27,821 --> 01:43:29,570
going to be six for a year.
Yeah.

2458
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:31,330
but not all night.
You know what I mean?

2459
01:43:31,350 --> 01:43:34,390
Because that's the problem is that you 
wind up as a parent,

2460
01:43:34,391 --> 01:43:36,220
you wind up with all this video that 
you,

2461
01:43:36,250 --> 01:43:37,870
that you're never going to watch because
it's.

2462
01:43:37,871 --> 01:43:39,400
But you're thinking logicAlly.
Yeah.

2463
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,540
Yeah.
Maybe people aren't.

2464
01:43:40,830 --> 01:43:42,680
They're just collecting video,
you know,

2465
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:44,440
they're just collecting their,
like hoarders.

2466
01:43:44,650 --> 01:43:45,483
Well,
the thing that made me think of it 

2467
01:43:45,971 --> 01:43:49,090
though is that I was more comfortable 
when I had the phone on.

2468
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:50,620
I was like,
oh yeah,

2469
01:43:50,621 --> 01:43:52,340
because I like,
I'm doing something,

2470
01:43:52,341 --> 01:43:53,174
like I'm not just dancing,
like if I'm just doing this thing I'm 

2471
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:58,310
doing like a,
like a parental kind of thing.

2472
01:43:58,310 --> 01:43:59,143
I'm just documenting my cute kid.
But then when I put the phone away I 

2473
01:44:01,611 --> 01:44:03,380
felt a lot more exposed.
But like,

2474
01:44:03,381 --> 01:44:04,800
okay,
why?

2475
01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:09,980
I thought it was painful for everybody 
that dance doing my ah,

2476
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:11,100
it's,
oh,

2477
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:13,130
it's terrible.
and every guy there had the same,

2478
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:14,450
had the same feeling,
I'm sure.

2479
01:44:14,451 --> 01:44:15,590
So.
But I was just like,

2480
01:44:15,591 --> 01:44:16,580
nope,
I'm not going to do it.

2481
01:44:16,581 --> 01:44:18,380
I'm putting my phone away.
This is stupid.

2482
01:44:18,770 --> 01:44:20,300
And tell you what though,
man,

2483
01:44:20,301 --> 01:44:24,470
you go back and look at those videos 
from when your kid was really little and

2484
01:44:24,471 --> 01:44:25,940
it does freak you out.
Like they're,

2485
01:44:25,950 --> 01:44:28,250
they're really valuable.
Powerful videos.

2486
01:44:28,410 --> 01:44:29,243
Yeah.
Videos of your kids when they're really 

2487
01:44:30,081 --> 01:44:30,920
young.
They're so,

2488
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:32,840
there's a video of my daughter when she 
was,

2489
01:44:34,010 --> 01:44:34,843
she was wearing a diaper,
I think she was probably just a little 

2490
01:44:36,891 --> 01:44:41,891
over one and we're walking through the 
airport and I'm pulling a,

2491
01:44:41,951 --> 01:44:42,784
uh,
one of those little roller bags and 

2492
01:44:44,091 --> 01:44:45,440
she's,
she's behind it,

2493
01:44:45,441 --> 01:44:46,040
pushing it.

2494
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:46,873
She liked to push it on her legs like 
that tall and a little diaper butt and 

2495
01:44:50,830 --> 01:44:52,910
me pushing this thing and we tell her,
hey,

2496
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:55,250
we're going to go to a toy store.
And she's like,

2497
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:56,113
oh.
And she puts her hands together and she 

2498
01:44:58,401 --> 01:45:00,600
pushes the bag in.
But it's like the most adorable.

2499
01:45:00,601 --> 01:45:02,940
My watched that video hundred times 
easier.

2500
01:45:02,990 --> 01:45:03,823
Yeah.
It's like that video will forever be 

2501
01:45:05,931 --> 01:45:08,360
stained in my brain.
That's crazy mode.

2502
01:45:08,410 --> 01:45:10,220
We've got these videos too.
There's an inch.

2503
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:12,740
There's a really interesting thing.
We were starting to get there earlier in

2504
01:45:12,741 --> 01:45:13,574
our conversation,
but there's an interesting thing that 

2505
01:45:14,751 --> 01:45:15,584
happens when you adopt kids,
particularly kids that are already 

2506
01:45:18,231 --> 01:45:20,120
walking and talking when they come into 
your life.

2507
01:45:20,630 --> 01:45:21,463
You go through this really chaotic 
adjustment period because nobody knows 

2508
01:45:25,251 --> 01:45:27,170
each other and it's very.
It's just.

2509
01:45:27,230 --> 01:45:30,560
it's just so awkward for everybody 
involved and and there's.

2510
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:32,570
There's a,
there's so much to it,

2511
01:45:32,571 --> 01:45:34,700
but it's a reallY difficult time for 
everybody,

2512
01:45:35,060 --> 01:45:37,880
but then when you have that,
when you get on the other side of it and

2513
01:45:37,881 --> 01:45:38,714
he really falling in love with your kids
and you could feel that they're falling 

2514
01:45:40,761 --> 01:45:42,860
in love with you and you're becoming 
this family.

2515
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:44,263
We have these videos.
We went on this trip back to Wisconsin 

2516
01:45:46,041 --> 01:45:46,874
where I'm from and when we were just.
Things were really starting to come 

2517
01:45:49,851 --> 01:45:52,340
together before this trip and then when 
we went on the trip,

2518
01:45:52,341 --> 01:45:54,620
the kids like you're describing the kid 
pushing the suitcase,

2519
01:45:54,621 --> 01:45:55,454
like they have to stay a little tighter 
with you because you're in airports and 

2520
01:45:58,071 --> 01:45:58,904
you're and you're driving and you're 
going to like a cabin and doing these 

2521
01:46:00,861 --> 01:46:03,860
things and by the time we got back we 
were a family.

2522
01:46:03,861 --> 01:46:05,840
Like we knew my wife and I were like,
wow,

2523
01:46:05,841 --> 01:46:06,600
we're,
we're,

2524
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:08,320
we're like a real family now.

2525
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:09,153
Like we love these kids so much and we 
can tell they love us and it's an 

2526
01:46:11,301 --> 01:46:12,134
amazing thing.
So we have videos from that trip and 

2527
01:46:14,031 --> 01:46:16,400
those videos like you're saying,
or just like gold,

2528
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:17,573
you know,
it's so amazing to see this phone 

2529
01:46:19,450 --> 01:46:20,810
number,
the bonding.

2530
01:46:21,930 --> 01:46:25,070
That's got to be such an intense feeling
to,

2531
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:30,360
to realize that these kids could have 
gone in some terrible direction.

2532
01:46:31,071 --> 01:46:33,200
I mean they could.
When you're six years old,

2533
01:46:33,201 --> 01:46:33,731
you're,
you're,

2534
01:46:33,731 --> 01:46:34,564
you're.
So,

2535
01:46:35,510 --> 01:46:37,820
anything can happen.
Anything can go wrong.

2536
01:46:37,821 --> 01:46:40,940
And instead they got so lucky and they 
found you.

2537
01:46:41,090 --> 01:46:41,923
I mean,
it's like what an incredibly positive 

2538
01:46:46,551 --> 01:46:50,010
thing that is,
that you've done an incredibly

2539
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:53,400
positive thing for their lives that they
came in contact with you.

2540
01:46:53,401 --> 01:46:55,440
And so fortunate,
I mean,

2541
01:46:55,470 --> 01:46:57,750
it's amazing,
but for our lives too,

2542
01:46:57,751 --> 01:46:59,700
and we didn't know it for a while,
you know,

2543
01:46:59,730 --> 01:47:00,563
we had that period where we were like,
you really feel like for awhile they're 

2544
01:47:03,661 --> 01:47:04,201
like,
okay,

2545
01:47:04,201 --> 01:47:05,034
we've,
we've done a good thing here and we're 

2546
01:47:06,211 --> 01:47:08,400
going to suffer for it for the rest of 
our lives.

2547
01:47:08,670 --> 01:47:10,650
And then.
But then as it comes online,

2548
01:47:10,651 --> 01:47:12,390
I had this one more,
I think I told you this,

2549
01:47:12,391 --> 01:47:15,660
but I had this one moment that,
and I'm not this kind of guy,

2550
01:47:15,661 --> 01:47:17,280
I don't think of myself as this kind of 
guy,

2551
01:47:17,281 --> 01:47:21,720
but after all of this,
just frustration and craziness and,

2552
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:22,613
and uh,
the kids would wake up really early 

2553
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:26,513
every morning and they would be out in 
the hallway throwing things at each 

2554
01:47:27,511 --> 01:47:28,980
other and arguing and whatever.

2555
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:29,813
And you,
you're so sleep deprived and you're 

2556
01:47:30,721 --> 01:47:32,930
just.
So like the overheads.

2557
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:36,930
And one morning I woke up,
I think it was a sunday and it was quiet

2558
01:47:36,931 --> 01:47:39,050
in the room,
my wife was still asleep and it was like

2559
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:43,080
around the time where the kids are 
normally up and I woke up and I thought,

2560
01:47:43,110 --> 01:47:44,310
oh wow,
it's quiet in here.

2561
01:47:44,311 --> 01:47:48,280
And then I had this just overwhelming 
feeling that I couldn't even identify it

2562
01:47:48,281 --> 01:47:49,200
first.
and then I thought,

2563
01:47:49,650 --> 01:47:52,140
oh shit,
I missed them right now.

2564
01:47:52,141 --> 01:47:55,140
Like I'm actually waiting for them to 
come in the room and wake us up.

2565
01:47:55,141 --> 01:47:55,974
And that was,
that was really a big moment for me 

2566
01:47:57,211 --> 01:47:58,140
where I was like,
wow,

2567
01:47:58,141 --> 01:48:02,430
I've turned a big corner here and that 
what you get from them and that,

2568
01:48:02,431 --> 01:48:04,380
those kinds of feelings is pretty 
incredible.

2569
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:05,393
Is this strange scene in the movie,
like thinking that this is based on not 

2570
01:48:09,751 --> 01:48:10,584
just your life experience but also based
on your interaction with some kids that 

2571
01:48:12,981 --> 01:48:14,190
you never wanted up adopting?

2572
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:15,360
Yeah,
it's.

2573
01:48:15,361 --> 01:48:17,460
Well and also I met a,
but like I said,

2574
01:48:17,461 --> 01:48:20,040
I've met a bunch of families along the 
waY and some of the.

2575
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:20,913
There's this young girl named Maria 
Green who became a consultant on the 

2576
01:48:23,341 --> 01:48:24,930
movie because she grew up in foster 
care.

2577
01:48:24,931 --> 01:48:27,210
She was adopted as a teenager.
She's amazIng kid.

2578
01:48:27,211 --> 01:48:28,044
She goes to ucla right now and uh,
and so I know either my own stories or 

2579
01:48:34,141 --> 01:48:34,974
other people's stories.
I can associate them with really 

2580
01:48:36,421 --> 01:48:39,090
specific kids.
So the thing that's embarrassing is that

2581
01:48:39,091 --> 01:48:39,924
I'm taking the movie all over the 
country and I've seen the movie like a 

2582
01:48:41,730 --> 01:48:44,130
thousand times now.
And anytime I watch it with an audience,

2583
01:48:44,131 --> 01:48:47,670
I get emotional watching the movie.
I mean the movie is really funny,

2584
01:48:47,671 --> 01:48:51,420
but it's got some really emotional 
moments and it's embarrassing because it

2585
01:48:51,421 --> 01:48:52,790
looks like,
oh good.

2586
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:54,690
So broken up by my,
my own movie,

2587
01:48:56,670 --> 01:48:57,503
but it's.
But it's really because I'm thinking 

2588
01:48:59,311 --> 01:49:01,140
about my own kids or I'm thinking about 
these,

2589
01:49:01,141 --> 01:49:02,850
these real kids that are,
you know,

2590
01:49:02,851 --> 01:49:03,960
that I've met along the way.

2591
01:49:04,350 --> 01:49:05,420
So it's,
it's pretty good.

2592
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:08,460
I got to tell you this,
that I know I'm in it and I'm amazing in

2593
01:49:08,461 --> 01:49:09,720
it,
but I'm saying I'm saying,

2594
01:49:10,110 --> 01:49:11,180
uh,
in the.

2595
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:16,220
We went to the screening like a month or
two ago and christina and I,

2596
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:17,273
uh,
get there and we run into mark right 

2597
01:49:19,501 --> 01:49:21,300
away.
So he's like,

2598
01:49:21,390 --> 01:49:22,380
he's like,
you haven't seen this?

2599
01:49:22,830 --> 01:49:23,491
And I go,
no.

2600
01:49:23,491 --> 01:49:26,310
He's like,
it's really men.

2601
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,840
It's really good.
And I was like,

2602
01:49:27,841 --> 01:49:29,070
yeah,
I keep hearing it's good.

2603
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:30,270
And he's like,
no.

2604
01:49:30,271 --> 01:49:31,104
Like he was like,
he was prepping me for how emotional he 

2605
01:49:34,831 --> 01:49:35,850
gets in it.
He goes,

2606
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:36,541
he's like,
ah,

2607
01:49:36,541 --> 01:49:36,881
you know,
I,

2608
01:49:36,881 --> 01:49:37,714
I've,
I've been some violent stuff that's 

2609
01:49:39,301 --> 01:49:40,770
awesome,
but this,

2610
01:49:41,070 --> 01:49:41,903
I'm in and he's like,
I couldn't help but like get emotional 

2611
01:49:45,691 --> 01:49:46,650
about it.
And I was like,

2612
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:47,800
okay.
I'm like,

2613
01:49:47,801 --> 01:49:48,634
all right.
and then I sit there and watch and then 

2614
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:52,990
I look over seeing this crying and parts
of the movie.

2615
01:49:52,991 --> 01:49:53,824
I start getting emotional person.
But I mean it's like he actually says 

2616
01:49:57,390 --> 01:49:58,223
you,
you did a really good job of balancing 

2617
01:49:59,741 --> 01:50:02,770
those emotional moments with the comedy.
So,

2618
01:50:02,771 --> 01:50:04,120
I mean,
I don't know how you do it,

2619
01:50:04,121 --> 01:50:04,954
but like the,
the back and forth of it was like a 

2620
01:50:06,791 --> 01:50:08,350
perfect balance.
And I think it's,

2621
01:50:08,351 --> 01:50:09,700
um,
it's a great movie.

2622
01:50:09,701 --> 01:50:12,640
I mean,
everybody who's seen it has,

2623
01:50:12,730 --> 01:50:16,540
you know that has said anything to me is
just like blown away by the movie.

2624
01:50:16,970 --> 01:50:17,500
Yeah,
that.

2625
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:19,730
Well,
and that balance of comedy and drama was

2626
01:50:19,731 --> 01:50:20,564
what we worked on.
that was the number one thing we worked 

2627
01:50:22,041 --> 01:50:26,030
on through every draft of everything and
it's great and it is really fun to watch

2628
01:50:26,031 --> 01:50:28,430
with an audience because they do get 
emotionally caught up in it,

2629
01:50:28,431 --> 01:50:31,130
but we're always coming back and giving 
them a laugh where they need it.

2630
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:32,900
You know,
and this is a hit.

2631
01:50:32,930 --> 01:50:33,763
Do you think they're going to want to 
dig down to other aspects of your 

2632
01:50:35,481 --> 01:50:38,180
personal life to pull out this is all I 
got.

2633
01:50:38,210 --> 01:50:39,043
This is bluestar airlines for me,
this is what does bluestar airlines in 

2634
01:50:42,561 --> 01:50:43,394
wall street when charlie sheen couldn't 
sell anything to gordon gekko and then 

2635
01:50:46,041 --> 01:50:47,600
he's like,
well what about bluestar lines?

2636
01:50:47,601 --> 01:50:48,434
Because he had the tip from his dad 
because his dad was a mechanic at blue 

2637
01:50:50,611 --> 01:50:51,444
star alliance.
That's been kind of the running joke 

2638
01:50:52,821 --> 01:50:54,590
that this is the only interesting thing 
in my life.

2639
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:59,120
I've Already gone there and It's just,
you know,

2640
01:50:59,121 --> 01:51:00,560
when this.
When this happens,

2641
01:51:00,561 --> 01:51:01,580
you know,
and you,

2642
01:51:01,850 --> 01:51:04,520
you become part of that adoption 
community as well,

2643
01:51:04,521 --> 01:51:05,354
so it really becomes a big part of who 
you are and who your family is and that 

2644
01:51:08,271 --> 01:51:09,700
kind of thing.
so you know,

2645
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:12,020
this is all I got.
I got this.

2646
01:51:12,021 --> 01:51:12,854
And then making movies.
This must be a different movie for you 

2647
01:51:15,561 --> 01:51:16,394
though.
I mean you,

2648
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:17,233
I'm sure you love your other movies,
but this one's going to be a really 

2649
01:51:19,671 --> 01:51:21,560
different fits.
It's really different because I,

2650
01:51:21,561 --> 01:51:23,510
you know,
I was talking about sex drive before and

2651
01:51:23,511 --> 01:51:24,344
the reason why that one was a special 
place in my heart is because it was my 

2652
01:51:26,241 --> 01:51:28,370
first real hollywood movie and I was 
just,

2653
01:51:28,710 --> 01:51:29,460
it,
it's,

2654
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:30,293
it was just such an amazing experience 
to just be this bumpkin from out of 

2655
01:51:33,051 --> 01:51:35,930
nowhere making this movie with all this 
budget and it was great.

2656
01:51:36,260 --> 01:51:39,470
But I've had great experiences on all 
the movies that I've made,

2657
01:51:39,471 --> 01:51:41,690
but this one is totally different.
It's a different tone.

2658
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:44,300
It has more drama,
it has more gravity to it.

2659
01:51:44,330 --> 01:51:48,180
It's about something that is really,
really important to me and it.

2660
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:51,770
And it's really funny and we have people
like tom and the movIe and tom is,

2661
01:51:51,771 --> 01:51:52,161
I mean,
you know,

2662
01:51:52,161 --> 01:51:54,500
we're joking,
but he is really funny in the movie.

2663
01:51:54,770 --> 01:51:56,980
I believe you.
It was funny.

2664
01:51:56,981 --> 01:51:58,160
He's a funny guy.
Yeah,

2665
01:51:58,161 --> 01:51:59,330
he's a fun.
I really do.

2666
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:03,320
Thanks ben.
Telling people that for years.

2667
01:52:03,321 --> 01:52:04,490
But I haven't been lying.

2668
01:52:05,470 --> 01:52:07,360
It was fun to do men.
It was really a thrill.

2669
01:52:08,790 --> 01:52:11,220
We just became one of those.
No,

2670
01:52:11,790 --> 01:52:12,780
but I'll tell you this though.

2671
01:52:13,310 --> 01:52:16,880
The comradery on that thing was another 
thing that was really fun because you go

2672
01:52:16,881 --> 01:52:17,714
to a different.
We went to atlanta and we have this 

2673
01:52:19,371 --> 01:52:22,250
great group every day where we have 
like,

2674
01:52:22,251 --> 01:52:23,990
you know,
you have the big stars.

2675
01:52:23,991 --> 01:52:27,200
But then like people I mentioned like 
margo and then uh,

2676
01:52:27,230 --> 01:52:28,820
and julie,
michael,

2677
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:30,050
allen,
brit,

2678
01:52:30,110 --> 01:52:31,490
jodie.
And we would just like,

2679
01:52:31,550 --> 01:52:32,383
it was like,
it is kind of like being in a camp or 

2680
01:52:33,891 --> 01:52:34,724
something,
which for me was the first experience 

2681
01:52:37,330 --> 01:52:37,630
you

2682
01:52:37,630 --> 01:52:38,463
don't know is that.
And what a lot of people who work in 

2683
01:52:40,091 --> 01:52:42,910
movies a lot of times that,
that so much of the,

2684
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:44,553
the um,
the comradery of the set is set by kind 

2685
01:52:47,630 --> 01:52:49,550
of number one,
number two on the call sheet,

2686
01:52:49,551 --> 01:52:52,040
like whoever the big movie stars are in 
your movie.

2687
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:53,500
Sometimes you know,
you,

2688
01:52:53,570 --> 01:52:55,490
you hear these stories,
a lot of stories,

2689
01:52:55,491 --> 01:52:56,324
steven seagal,
but just people walking on eggshells 

2690
01:53:00,770 --> 01:53:01,730
around,
you know,

2691
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:03,170
whoever the,
you know,

2692
01:53:03,171 --> 01:53:04,004
and when you have people like mark and 
rose were really cool and just really 

2693
01:53:06,711 --> 01:53:07,544
easy to deal with everybody.
Everybody just is so much more relaxed 

2694
01:53:10,881 --> 01:53:12,860
and having a really good time when,
you know.

2695
01:53:12,861 --> 01:53:13,561
And then,
I mean,

2696
01:53:13,561 --> 01:53:14,394
you know,
I'll take some credit for it myself too 

2697
01:53:15,441 --> 01:53:16,274
because john and I tried to run a really
happy set and we just try to have 

2698
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:19,250
definitely,
man,

2699
01:53:19,610 --> 01:53:23,620
definitely you guys are so like you guys
are low maintenance types,

2700
01:53:23,660 --> 01:53:26,580
you know,
like you're like the type of people like

2701
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:31,310
it feels I took you for just to show you
how unpretentious he is.

2702
01:53:31,580 --> 01:53:34,460
When I got the part I was like,
I,

2703
01:53:34,790 --> 01:53:38,660
we'd been speaking about the part and 
other things and then you know,

2704
01:53:38,750 --> 01:53:43,280
I'll get an email about rehearsal at 
paramount and I would just call sean,

2705
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:44,810
like the director director.
I'm like,

2706
01:53:45,050 --> 01:53:46,490
hey,
is rehearsal at 10?

2707
01:53:46,550 --> 01:53:47,240
And he's like,
uh,

2708
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:48,200
yeah.
And I'm like,

2709
01:53:48,201 --> 01:53:49,460
where do I park?
And he's like,

2710
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:50,833
I think in the,
there's a lot that they'll tell you 

2711
01:53:53,191 --> 01:53:54,650
they'll to go and I'm like,
okay,

2712
01:53:54,651 --> 01:53:55,550
and then hang up.
And I'd be like,

2713
01:53:55,580 --> 01:53:59,060
I'm just calling the director of like a 
major picture.

2714
01:53:59,061 --> 01:54:04,061
Like where do I park?
And he was never fucking figure it out,

2715
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:05,570
you know,
he was just like,

2716
01:54:05,571 --> 01:54:06,141
yeah,
it's fine.

2717
01:54:06,141 --> 01:54:08,600
Just call me if you need parking 
directions.

2718
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:10,640
It's really fun.
When is this?

2719
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:12,820
Is it out right now?
Comes out friday.

2720
01:54:12,870 --> 01:54:14,300
Comes out just for our 16th.
Yeah.

2721
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:15,193
Beautiful.

2722
01:54:15,860 --> 01:54:17,810
I think we can wrap this.
That was great.

2723
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:18,860
Yeah.
Thank you man.

2724
01:54:18,861 --> 01:54:20,060
Thank you.
Thanks for doing this.

2725
01:54:20,061 --> 01:54:21,890
Thanks for making the movie.
Thanks for everything.

2726
01:54:21,891 --> 01:54:24,050
Thanks for hiring my friend.
Thanks for by the way,

2727
01:54:24,051 --> 01:54:24,884
I wanted to tell you before we,
before we cut out that video that you 

2728
01:54:26,901 --> 01:54:29,930
did share that you were talking about 
before of the little girl.

2729
01:54:29,931 --> 01:54:32,180
Got a little girl when that,
when that went out,

2730
01:54:32,181 --> 01:54:34,710
we were in this process of discussing,
you know,

2731
01:54:34,730 --> 01:54:35,563
the movie and and how to kind of get the
message out on the movie and I got that 

2732
01:54:38,331 --> 01:54:41,210
video.
I saw it on your thing and I immediately

2733
01:54:41,211 --> 01:54:43,760
sent it to everybody associated with the
movie and I was like,

2734
01:54:43,761 --> 01:54:44,870
you guys,
this is our movie.

2735
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:48,110
It's right here in this video.
It's right here and that girls face.

2736
01:54:48,111 --> 01:54:49,190
That's it.
That's our movie.

2737
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:50,840
Wow.
That was really helpful.

2738
01:54:50,841 --> 01:54:53,230
I'm glad you sent that out.
Oh,

2739
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:54,073
I could not.
When I got ahold of that video was so 

2740
01:54:56,541 --> 01:54:58,100
intense.
It was so amazing.

2741
01:54:59,660 --> 01:55:00,241
I know.
You were trying to.

2742
01:55:00,241 --> 01:55:00,861
Oh no,
no worries,

2743
01:55:00,861 --> 01:55:01,694
man.
No,

2744
01:55:02,110 --> 01:55:05,090

2745
01:55:05,091 --> 01:55:07,010
You go see it.
Bye everybody.

2746
01:55:07,070 --> 01:55:07,903
Thanks.
