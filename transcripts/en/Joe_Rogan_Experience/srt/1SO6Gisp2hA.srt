1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,440
Hello Freak bitches.
I'm calling my brother for you.

2
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:07,120
So go ahead.
I believe you not,

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,530
it's not that I don't believe you,
it's just that he's really funny.

4
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:14,580
You want to talk to him?
Coc and sort the phone.

5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,770
He's probably fucking up somebody
transmission.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,310
Was you transmission specialists?
No,

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,510
he's a,
he's a fake ass mechanic.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,600
A fake.
A fake mechanic who tell you he knew so

9
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,790
he doesn't really know he's doing here.
Come back.

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,500
He'd say you fix cars were really don't.
I mean he ain't went to school for it.

11
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:36,330
He just be trying some shit.
So he just fucks around.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,710
He fixed my car.
One time I had a um,

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,950
I had an SUV.
I Montero so I needed a head job.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,460
So he told me with the spot plus kept
jumping out the engine.

15
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,980
So that jumped out of and you know,
they kept coming out because they needed

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,240
to.

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,360
He had stripped the um,
the heads on my car.

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,800
So instead of saying,
Hey,

19
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:57,200
I fucked up here,
your heads,

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,710
you know,
you need to get a hedgehog.

21
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,390
This boy went on my back porch,
got my bobby q bachelor,

22
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:04,890
broke that bitch out,
stuck it in the engine and screwed that

23
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:06,780
gasket back down.
So I was like,

24
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:08,520
the car still running ragged it,
so I was like,

25
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:10,590
fuck you.
You taught my $300.

26
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,430
I go to the dealership dollars.
He took a barbecue spatula.

27
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,430
She's attached to.
You're lucky it didn't explode.

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,740
He said,
look,

29
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,580
I pull up to the dealership.
I'm not lying.

30
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,210
And the man take the thing.
And he said,

31
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:26,730
ma'am,
who put a barbecue spatula and your

32
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:27,750
engine?
I said,

33
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:32,751
that motherfucker ain't
charge you $300 to put up a barbecue

34
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:35,460
spatula,
barbecues bachelor.

35
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:37,480
That cost me $200.
You know what?

36
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:41,390
I'm real long fire.
Yes,

37
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:43,670
yes.
He broke that bitch and stuck it in my

38
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:44,850
end.
Jot is ridiculous.

39
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,800
And I was like,
why didn't you do that motherfucker?

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,290
He was like,
I was trying to keep your spark plugs in

41
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,124
your engine.

42
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,970
Did he learn anywhere?
Did he go to school?

43
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:58,971
He's getting better.
He's getting better.

44
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,610
No more specialist.
He's a.

45
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,950
he's at the point when you can trust him
with an oil change and oil change.

46
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,550
Oh,
I will trust my daughter with an oil

47
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:12,384
train.
No,

48
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,250
just him because he was leaving the
heart.

49
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,270
Just a courts.
This is where they go.

50
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,510
I'll fucking art design.
Yeah.

51
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,040
But he is horrible.
Oh my God.

52
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,340
That's hilarious.
He's learning.

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,190
He's handled.
Draining.

54
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,870
Where does he do it?
All?

55
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:29,530
In and around.
He got a mobile business.

56
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,970
A mobile business.
As soon as he fuck up your car.

57
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:34,370
He changed his.
No,

58
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,280
he doesn't.
He really got three.

59
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,410
Anthony's in here.
Oh

60
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,100
fucking hilarious.
So you just fucked up people's cars.

61
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:46,950
Changes his number and just gets ghost.
Well again,

62
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:49,470
you know,
my wife's a psychiatrist,

63
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:51,900
she,
she's dealt with all this kind of stuff

64
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:53,190
and she laughed.

65
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,850
She just cracks up because she sees it.
She sees it immediately.

66
00:02:56,851 --> 00:03:01,851
And just like her way of dealing with
insanity is laughter and is she works

67
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,120
with what she's worked with all sorts of
people,

68
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:09,121
but her sort of specialization is loony
bin like one flew over the cuckoo's nest

69
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:11,420
kind of scenes.
Right.

70
00:03:11,421 --> 00:03:13,450
I,
I remember going in with her the first

71
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:17,830
time I visited her at work,
she was running a mental hospital with

72
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,350
like double doors and bars over the
windows,

73
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:24,340
these criminally insane people who had
killed their kids and you know,

74
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:25,780
like crazy shit.
Right.

75
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,170
And we went in there and I wasn't
prepared,

76
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:33,130
man.
We went in and it was just like lunatics

77
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,810
and there was this woman like must've
been in her mid fifties lying on her

78
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:41,260
back in a little nightgown.
No underwear her with her,

79
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:42,840
like arms and legs,
you know,

80
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,880
like a crab doing a crab thing and we
walk in like this,

81
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,000
you know,
pussy in the whole scene.

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Just scared the shit out of me and just
started laughing like,

83
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:56,050
yo crazy old lady,
what are you doing?

84
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:59,290
Get up from there.
She just like last.

85
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,660
And the thing that I didn't understand
until I,

86
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,200
I hung out with her is that people who
are psychotic,

87
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,150
no,
they're psychotic.

88
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,430
And so they kind of know how ridiculous
they are.

89
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,360
And as a doctor,
when she laughs,

90
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,480
she laughs in such a loving,
accepting,

91
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,190
I get you kind of way that it creates
this instant rapport and they start

92
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,210
laughing.
Oh.

93
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,580
So it relieves a little tension,
right?

94
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,940
Like it's all okay,
I know you're just another crazy person.

95
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:32,440
I deal with you all the time and come
on,

96
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,000
it's,
it's Kinda like how,

97
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,750
you know,
like a,

98
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,750
a gynecologist I imagine would have to
sort of be so laid back that you kind

99
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:40,421
of,
you know.

100
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:41,860
Okay,
he seen a million pussies.

101
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,380
I like,
it relaxes you in a way,

102
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,020
you know,
I think she does that with,

103
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,430
uh,
with crazy people.

104
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,460
It's normal people who make her really
uncomfortable.

105
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,091
Oh yeah.
I mean,

106
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,780
imagine if you were a gynecologist and
you were super nervous about seeing

107
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,623
someone.

108
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,530
Okay.
I guess we're about to do that.

109
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,590
Hold on the of modern my face.
Let me have a little more wine.

110
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,710
Just another days off
that's happening.

111
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,980
Let's see what you got wrong down there.
I'm looking,

112
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,160
I'm looking,
going to use a mirror.

113
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,530
I like.
It's like it's a fucking vampire Medusa.

114
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,740
You can't look in the eyes.

115
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,690
Do you remember back in Boston?
You were out one night with Jennifer and

116
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:28,290
I was home and I swear to God on my
father's grave,

117
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,840
this happened.
I rented Batman,

118
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,370
the blockbuster
and I put it in and I'm sitting at home

119
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:40,371
and I'm watching it and then all of a
sudden I see this shadow and then I turn

120
00:05:40,471 --> 00:05:44,730
my head and I see another shadow and I
look up and there's a bat flying around

121
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,710
the apartment and I'm like,
what?

122
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:50,280
And I'm scared shitless of bats.
Like,

123
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,180
it's like my thing
ever since I was a kid,

124
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:57,180
my aunt had this bar near her and they
had bats and they would be me.

125
00:05:57,181 --> 00:06:00,440
They were fruit bats and if they bite
you you'll get rabies and you'll die.

126
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:01,200
And,
and so,

127
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,400
and we would always be outside playing
tag at night and I would fucking,

128
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:05,960
bats would fly by and I'd freak out.

129
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,080
And,
and so I'm alone in the apartment and as

130
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:12,890
a bat flying around and Batman is on TV.
And so,

131
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,110
uh,
all I knew is they go in your hair,

132
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:20,111
which I think is like not even true.
So I put on a baseball cap backwards and

133
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,480
I had on sunglasses and a tennis racket.
Some glad I didn't want them going in my

134
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:28,140
eyes.
He's going to go for.

135
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,260
So I'm running around the apartment
swinging at him.

136
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:34,550
He's taken off.
He's like,

137
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:35,750
you know,
he's just,

138
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,260
they're erratic the way they fly it on a
where they're fucking going and this

139
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:42,050
goes on for like 10 minutes and then
there's like a standoff and I'm waiting

140
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,250
and then I hear you coming up the stairs
and you came in and you open the door

141
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:47,510
and you go,
what the fuck?

142
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,890
You do bad in here and you just,
you just grabbed the tennis racket out

143
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:55,430
of my hand and he walked up and he was
in the window and you just bashed him

144
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:59,360
once and he just went down and then you
just walked over and you had taken your

145
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:00,710
hand and just went into the kitchen.

146
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:05,420
Start eating it.
I'm stay on sunglasses and I remember

147
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,880
that.
That's hilarious.

148
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,630
That's hilarious.
I probably wouldn't even killed it if

149
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,490
you weren't already trying to kill it.
I think you,

150
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,820
you might.
I call the animal people to come get it

151
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:20,830
because it looked like it was stunned if
he was actually dead,

152
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,890
had been sick.
Oh,

153
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:23,130
you mean once I hit it?
Yeah.

154
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,980
No,
it was.

155
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,540
It was probably.
I remember I told him.

156
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,510
Yeah,
I remember.

157
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:27,980
I'm like,
I'm not going to have this thing suffer.

158
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,220
I don't remember what I did,
but I remember it was some hitting

159
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:33,080
involved.
I'm pretty sure it was the tennis racket

160
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,920
could have been.
Yeah,

161
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,830
you were fearless.
I was like,

162
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:40,040
fuck man,
I don't like.
