1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,990
Today's all about positivity.

2
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:04,824
Ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,993
today,

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,060
today we're bringing it
back to the plus side.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,390
There's been some ripples in the
force over the last few days.

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,810
We've gone through them and through a
strict diet of staying awake all night and

7
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:19,500
not get enough food,

8
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:21,360
no system or back.

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,750
I'm living off macaroni salad and living
off macaroni salad and flashlights that

10
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:30,180
Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the flashlight.

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,440
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on
the link for the fleshlight and enter in

12
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:35,310
the code name Brogan,

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,250
you'll save yourself 15% off
the number one sex toys for men.

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,350
It's also brought to you by
[inaudible] dot com Brian,

15
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:44,940
we're going to get you some Onnit pills.

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,850
I'm going to get you up on it on it.

17
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:48,720
Uh,

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:48,920
what,

19
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,710
what is on it?

20
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,510
What is that?

21
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:50,880
It's,

22
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,091
well,

23
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:52,470
most of it is nootropics,

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,590
Alpha brain being the most
popular and most controversial.

25
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,720
And my favorite one with nootropics are,

26
00:00:57,721 --> 00:00:58,950
if you're interested in any of this stuff,

27
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:00,390
I suggest you Google it.

28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,220
Go Google the word neutral bic and
listen to the research pro and con.

29
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:05,761
And you know,

30
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:09,180
there's been studies done on various
nootropics that have actually helped

31
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:09,680
people,

32
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:09,870
uh,

33
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,220
who had Alzheimer's disease.

34
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:15,990
And there's a bunch of research to
suggest that there are nutrients that can

35
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:17,910
enhance the levels of neuro cameras,

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,840
have a neurotransmitter's that your brain
makes and enhance the way your brain

37
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:22,590
functions.

38
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,580
It's very controversial,

39
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,760
but if you're interested in
it and you want to try it,

40
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:27,361
Alpha brain,

41
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:28,710
the first 30 pills,

42
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,510
there's a hundred percent
money back guarantee.

43
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,381
If you,

44
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:32,310
if you try it and you'll like,

45
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:32,920
this stuff sucks,

46
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,030
you don't even have to bring the pills
back enough to send them back and you

47
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:36,720
just say,

48
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,650
this is not for me.

49
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,840
If you are into it,

50
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,370
enter in the code name Brogan and you'll
save 10% off any and all orders and go

51
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:48,590
to the website and check out all
the different information and uh,

52
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:52,100
all the different explanations for
what each thing is supposed to do in,

53
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:53,010
and do your research,

54
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:54,090
Google it and check it all out.

55
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:54,811
But we're,

56
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:58,170
we're very concerned with making sure
that no one feels ripped off in any way,

57
00:01:58,171 --> 00:01:58,771
shape or form.

58
00:01:58,771 --> 00:01:59,160
That's,

59
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,590
that's primary before even making money.

60
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,850
That's why it's a hundred percent money
back guarantee on your first order.

61
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,840
If you try it and you're like,

62
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:08,100
this is just not my shit,

63
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:08,970
I take it.

64
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,760
I took it before I ever
endorsed any of this stuff.

65
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,320
I took a bill,

66
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:14,910
Roman oskies neuro one,

67
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,880
if you know about Bill Romanowski
had a lot of head injuries,

68
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:18,930
a lot of concussions,

69
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:23,010
and one of the ways he dealt with it
was concocting this neutral big blend.

70
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,860
And I became fascinated with
the nootropics and his stuff.

71
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:27,300
I still recommend that I still buy it too.

72
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:28,410
It's good stuff and it's got,

73
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:29,490
it actually has a bit of,

74
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,350
I believe it has a bit
of caffeine in it too,

75
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,184
which I like,

76
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,500
you know,

77
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,380
phone real fucking pick me up.

78
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:35,214
It's great stuff.

79
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:35,820
Anyway,

80
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,280
check it out.

81
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,130
Go to [inaudible] Dot Com oh and and it,

82
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:40,650
my friend Brian counts
here and the party went.

83
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:42,030
Now Begin Ladies and gentlemen,

84
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,953
Ladies

85
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,300
[inaudible] experience
[inaudible] the opening forever.

86
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,590
Coolest moments of my
UFC broadcasting career.

87
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,590
How about Rory Macdonald?

88
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,231
He's in there too.

89
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:02,980
He's at the beginning.

90
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,930
That kid is ridiculous.

91
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:05,191
God,

92
00:03:05,191 --> 00:03:07,320
he's scared and was so
much bigger than him too.

93
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,900
I'm going to shoot a single leg on you
at will and then I'm going to climb you

94
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:11,950
and I'm going to beat you up.

95
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,450
He's so scary because he's,

96
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:13,961
first of all,

97
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:16,900
he's like super duper dedicated
and he's one of those kids.

98
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:18,100
He's only like 22.

99
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,930
You know when you're only like 22,

100
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:20,920
23 years old,

101
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:21,430
man,

102
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,150
you can get,

103
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,380
if you get that good,

104
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:24,214
that young,

105
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,840
you can get away with a lot of shit.

106
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,531
He can't.

107
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:28,300
He's the one who came
up with just pure MMA.

108
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,380
But I also think I'm as good as these
athletes are now and everything else

109
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:32,940
there.

110
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,950
There are some people that have a,

111
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,620
um,

112
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,640
like a real edge,

113
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:40,060
but it's gotta be because their
philosophy and who's teaching them,

114
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:40,301
you know,

115
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:42,820
sort of there cops that
it's certainly part of that.

116
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,260
But to get a Roy McDonald,

117
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:45,190
it's so rare.

118
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,190
It's so rare that you get someone
who has that kind of focus,

119
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:49,450
that kind of intensity.

120
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,141
Dude,

121
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:50,621
how about his,

122
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:51,041
his,

123
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,660
his a stair and that I've met in
the beginning of that creepy dude.

124
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,050
He just goes quiet.

125
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,600
His whole body just goes fucking quiet.

126
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,490
He's like a Predator like the way Elian
when it stops really quick to seize.

127
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,773
Yeah,

128
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,073
just shoot.

129
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,771
And I was like,

130
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:07,150
that dude's so focused.

131
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:08,050
It's ridiculous.

132
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,610
He's very unusual.

133
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,350
Very unusual kid.

134
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,920
Seems like a really nice
guy outside of fighting,

135
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,270
super friendly,

136
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:19,440
really easygoing and just
mauling motherfuckers.

137
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,710
He just does what he wants and Net
and 22 you see what at that age,

138
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:24,850
when you're really young like that,

139
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:26,860
you can get so good so quick.

140
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,180
And when you're with kids that are really
focused and really dedicated at those

141
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:31,300
early ages,

142
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,730
they make these huge leaps and like six,

143
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,391
eight months,

144
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:35,370
these giant leaps,

145
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:37,410
it take a grown man years to,

146
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:40,390
to hit [inaudible] just
really accelerates so quickly.

147
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,130
I think that's like my buddy was right.

148
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:44,910
He's writing a book on learning and he's
the kind of like just one of these guys

149
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,060
went to Harvard and stayed with,

150
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,500
hasn't he speaks literally,

151
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:50,350
he really does speak
seven languages fluently,

152
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,370
like really does.

153
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:51,880
Wow.

154
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,710
And he has his degree in biomedical
engineering and all these one,

155
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,660
is it kind of a genius?

156
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,290
And,

157
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,010
and uh,

158
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,401
I said,

159
00:04:57,401 --> 00:04:59,470
how do you speak all those languages?

160
00:04:59,500 --> 00:04:59,681
He goes,

161
00:04:59,681 --> 00:04:59,801
well,

162
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,300
it's funny because I'm
writing a book about learning.

163
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,261
And I said,

164
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:02,540
well,

165
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,460
what's your philosophy?

166
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:03,671
He said,

167
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:03,821
well,

168
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:06,250
most of the time with learning when you,

169
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:07,450
when you have to learn something,

170
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:11,020
you already have a lot of preconceived
notions about what you can and can't do.

171
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,380
So you usually come to the equation
with this notion that I'm good at this.

172
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,960
I'm not good at that because
somebody along the way told you that.

173
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,000
So most of what learning is,

174
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:19,390
is,

175
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,350
is just getting out of your own way
before you can even learn anything.

176
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,850
Because you come to it
with your own projection,

177
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,900
your own sort of,

178
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:29,734
um,

179
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,930
a scaffolding that you put on it.

180
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:32,550
And,

181
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,470
and so his philosophy
is like he just said,

182
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:36,640
I can speak languages.

183
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,510
I'm gonna get out of my own way.

184
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,590
I can speak languages.

185
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,910
I'm going to find the system.

186
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:41,590
So it's like Tim Ferriss says,

187
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,550
if you want to learn Spanish,

188
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,710
do you only have to know
really 2.5% of the words?

189
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,720
And you can understand 95% of Spanish,

190
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,910
it'll take you five more years to learn,

191
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,270
uh,

192
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,740
5% of all the Spanish words.

193
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:51,730
But you'll only learn,

194
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:53,870
you only understand 98% of spam.

195
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:54,260
You,

196
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,480
the increment is very small.

197
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:56,140
So there's,

198
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,680
there's a,

199
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,220
there's a to learning.

200
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,530
It's just like when you
want to educate yourself,

201
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:00,681
there's,

202
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:00,831
it's,

203
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:01,820
there's a system to it.

204
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,840
There's a way to do it.

205
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:03,491
There's a,

206
00:06:03,491 --> 00:06:03,830
there's a,

207
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,300
there's a methodology and actually
a pattern and a path to follow.

208
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,340
And most people spend a lot of time,

209
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:10,910
you know,

210
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,721
wasting,

211
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:14,630
wasting a lot of time with
a lot of periphery stuff.

212
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,650
Mainly dealing with the fact
that they're not good at this.

213
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:19,790
I'm not good at math,

214
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,110
I'm not good at languages.

215
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,430
I'm not good with money.

216
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,580
And what he'll do in this
book that this premises is,

217
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:28,430
those are all a belief systems
that somebody else put on you.

218
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:28,880
You don't,

219
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,060
you,

220
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,080
that's actually not true.

221
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,180
And you can get rid of it.

222
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,380
You can get rid of him if you
know how to approach something.

223
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,090
So it's pretty wild.

224
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:35,990
Um,

225
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,411
so you know,

226
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:40,460
someone like Rory Macdonald probably
started so young that this is a language

227
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:42,020
and it's the only language has ever known.

228
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:43,010
So when you teach him something,

229
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:43,910
he's not in his own way.

230
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:44,871
He's like,

231
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:44,961
well,

232
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:45,320
I'll just,

233
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,970
I'll just incorporate
this into my arsenal.

234
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,600
That's a real good point because when
we used to get guys who came from other

235
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:52,940
styles that would want to learn taekwondo,

236
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:56,250
there's a difference to
the style of kicking and a,

237
00:06:56,251 --> 00:06:56,931
a lot of it,

238
00:06:56,931 --> 00:07:00,620
I incorporated how you
lifted up your knees and uh,

239
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:00,921
the,

240
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:05,000
they had developed a style of kicking
where the knee was down and then the foot

241
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:06,580
was above the knee and it's,

242
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:09,740
it's a more like leg
centric style of kicking.

243
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,420
Whereas the taekwondo style,

244
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:14,720
the knee is a pie which opens the hips up.

245
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:15,830
And when the hips open up,

246
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:20,300
then there's a turn of the whole body
and it's got so much more power to it,

247
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,100
but we couldn't teach them how to do it.

248
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,113
They all would,

249
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,290
especially when sparring,

250
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,080
it would just drop their knee and it
would be normal stuff and be like,

251
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,280
do you gotta get your knee up?

252
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,480
That's the most important thing.

253
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,650
The knee is everything.

254
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,010
Well,

255
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,060
the knee comes power.

256
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,320
A huge part of learning also is that is
exactly what you're saying because like

257
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,550
a lot of times you,

258
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,060
you go to what's comfortable.

259
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,350
Yeah,

260
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:38,961
go and because,

261
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:41,150
because practicing actually the
way to get good at something,

262
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:42,560
obviously it's to practice
what you're not good at,

263
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:43,610
what makes you uncomfortable,

264
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:45,980
but it doesn't have to
make you uncomfortable.

265
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:48,310
What's making you uncomfortable
is the notion that you,

266
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:50,270
you is the things that you've put on it.

267
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,620
So I'm weak.

268
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,530
I'm not good at least.

269
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,610
See a lot of guys that come in
and Jujitsu and they only do what?

270
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:54,921
What?

271
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:55,850
They're good with it.

272
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,890
They don't spend time on their
back or they don't spend time,

273
00:07:57,891 --> 00:07:58,580
whatever.

274
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,060
Why?

275
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,860
Because they're going to look vulnerable.

276
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,330
But you're defining that
that process as vulnerable,

277
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:07,130
you can redefine the process,

278
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:09,830
you can decide that it's just you getting
better cause you're working on where

279
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:10,431
your soft,

280
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:11,000
right.

281
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,170
So it's really so much of it is
your attitude monitors your talent,

282
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:20,630
what you come in with and actually more
a more specific way of saying it is what

283
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:21,950
you don't come in with it.

284
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,430
So much of learning is
actually not an addition,

285
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:26,190
a process of addition.

286
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:26,750
It's processed,

287
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,410
deletion deleting.

288
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:28,790
Right.

289
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,623
You know,

290
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:30,590
you're,

291
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,020
you're,

292
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,610
you're,

293
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,600
I think actually,

294
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,960
you know it's funny as you become an
adult and you get better at something,

295
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:36,501
you know,

296
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:37,610
certainly for me with stand up,

297
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,070
so much of it is just like
letting go of a lot of stuff,

298
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:44,150
like deleting things in my mind that
I don't need to be thinking about.

299
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,280
I should be thinking about
something very positive.

300
00:08:46,281 --> 00:08:47,240
So you started learning.

301
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,610
I started drifting off into
something I'm worried about.

302
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,180
I just gently bring my mind
back to writing about standup.

303
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:54,410
I bring it back to stand up,

304
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:55,110
I bring it back.

305
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,331
Right.

306
00:08:55,331 --> 00:08:55,771
And the joke,

307
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:56,040
I bring

308
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,700
it back to thinking about this TV show
I'm trying to do so you can actually get

309
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:03,960
very disciplined and good
at at redirecting your mind.

310
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:04,690
It's not a,

311
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,390
it's not a PA,

312
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,660
an active process.

313
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:08,700
You can make it a very passive process.

314
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,061
You know,

315
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:11,250
a lot of times when you
hear people talk about work,

316
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,391
I got to go to work,

317
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:13,380
I got to do this work.

318
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,641
We put this,

319
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:16,340
this sort of sacred scaffold.

320
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:18,300
It's a sacred like fence around work.

321
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,590
I'm playing now,

322
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:20,424
I'm going to work.

323
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,840
It shouldn't be that way.

324
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:23,580
You can completely blur that line.

325
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:25,290
You can completely like just decide,

326
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,740
well,

327
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,600
work is what I do anyway.

328
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:32,600
I'm just going to gently start thinking
about what I want to be and what I want

329
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,160
I want to be doing and
how to create something.

330
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:35,400
You had.

331
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,930
The work issues are very,

332
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:40,050
it's a very touchy issue for a
lot of people because most people,

333
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:41,550
that's the bane of their existence.

334
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,060
Yeah,

335
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,020
and with us,

336
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,400
it's actually what we love to do.

337
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,211
That's a,

338
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:47,580
that's a trick pill for a
lot of people to swallow.

339
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:48,840
That's really fucking hard.

340
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,450
A lot of really want to hear that.

341
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,600
That we associate the idea with work at
some point in our life with displeasure

342
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,681
with that's right.

343
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,320
Uncomfort with with you
don't want to be there.

344
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:02,220
It's not fun.

345
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,600
It's not what you look forward to.

346
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:04,680
Well,

347
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,760
well because for I think the
ideal when you talk about work,

348
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:11,280
the ideal is and,

349
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:14,760
and I think anybody who's in a position
where they don't like if you're in a job

350
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:15,600
you hate or whatever,

351
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,880
the only way to get out
of that job is people say,

352
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:20,310
well I'm going to move and I'm going
to do this is actually to come up with

353
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:21,144
another idea.

354
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,171
You know,

355
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:22,591
if you can,

356
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,500
if you can try to come
up with a better idea,

357
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,060
it'll beat the other idea.

358
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,710
So you might be doing something but,

359
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,380
but the work actually
is about imagination.

360
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,600
It's about just sitting there
and letting it come to you.

361
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,410
Figuring I just be figuring
out what is your process?

362
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:37,930
What is,

363
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:38,311
what do you,

364
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:40,500
what is your private as a different
process and listen to music.

365
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:41,310
Somebody will walk.

366
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:41,611
What's,

367
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:44,760
what's the process you
have to undertake to feel,

368
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:44,900
to,

369
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,540
to get yourself into a creative mode
where you're coming up with ideas,

370
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,770
whether you're an entrepreneur,

371
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,880
whether you're a writer,

372
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,020
whether you're a painter,

373
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,520
even if you're an athlete.

374
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:53,761
I mean,

375
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:54,660
you know Rory Macdonald,

376
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:57,900
those guys have to constantly think
about MMA and I'm noticing is they always

377
00:10:57,901 --> 00:10:59,430
have to reinvent.

378
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,020
They got to keep adding to their arsenal.

379
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:01,854
They got to keep growing.

380
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,870
And a lot of that's imagination then,

381
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:04,530
right,

382
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:04,920
isn't it?

383
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,270
I mean a lot of it imagination,

384
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,920
that's how it's manifesting itself.

385
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,880
Their creativity isn't beating the fuck
out of people and it will people that

386
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:13,170
are as Dan is like you,

387
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:13,411
you,

388
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:15,510
you actually have to be
creative and fighting.

389
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:19,350
It's a very creative thing and it when it,

390
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,670
when you get good at it,

391
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,620
it's a lot of it is figuring out how to
hit someone in a way where they can hit

392
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:28,110
you back or where you hit them first,

393
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:30,630
where they're trying to hit you but you
get out of the way and then you count

394
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:31,440
her and hit them.

395
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,060
And in doing that,

396
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,780
you can pick up like
dumb people fight dumb.

397
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,590
They Ma,

398
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:42,240
they waddle forward first day throw the
left and then they throw the ride and

399
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:44,010
all you have to do is
keep your wits about you.

400
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,170
You see the left come and
you know the rights coming.

401
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,980
It's just not,

402
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,150
it's not going to be an upper cut either.

403
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,620
It's going to be a big stupid overhand.

404
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:50,070
Right.

405
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,300
And that is that.

406
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:53,680
That's the language that they in.

407
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,150
When your creative,

408
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,920
you become very scary.

409
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,100
Like a guy like Jon Jones is very
frightening to people because he's very

410
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:01,570
creative in his attack.

411
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,531
You don't know what he's going to do.

412
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:03,940
I mean he fights shogun.

413
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:07,120
Shogun is like the best trackers
or if he opens with a flying knee,

414
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:07,920
cracks him.

415
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,430
The John shoguns never the same.

416
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,300
He fucked them up from the first sec
few seconds of the fight when he threw

417
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:17,650
Rashad Rashad Evans in
that flying triangle.

418
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:18,580
You know,

419
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:18,881
he's just like,

420
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:19,160
I have,

421
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,771
I'm doing MMA.

422
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:20,770
I just want to see if I could do it.

423
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,680
It's old guard for no reason
to Colorado was that way.

424
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:24,191
I remember soccer,

425
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,970
I would show up in in a t shirt that
said water or a paint muscles on himself

426
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,800
and he was completely creative.

427
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,030
And I think that's the lesson,

428
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:31,211
right?

429
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:31,600
Yeah.

430
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,590
You don't know what he's doing.

431
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:32,771
Yeah.

432
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:34,150
But that'll come on some shit.

433
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,710
But see that comes from,

434
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:35,981
if you,

435
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:36,281
if you,

436
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:38,680
if you actually look at most
people and we all do it,

437
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,031
a lot of people,

438
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:41,080
especially young people,

439
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:43,420
as they start becoming aware
of the world around them,

440
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,320
what they'll do is they'll look for
something very strong to define themselves

441
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:48,580
as I'm a fighter,

442
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,451
a,

443
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:49,751
I'm a,

444
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:50,021
I'm,

445
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:50,980
I'm a slacker,

446
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:51,880
I'm a skateboarder,

447
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:52,151
I'm,

448
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:53,200
I'm fucking rebel.

449
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:54,034
I get tattooed.

450
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,240
And when you define yourself
along really strong lines,

451
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,860
I think it becomes varied.

452
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:03,070
And I'm not talking about
defining yourself character wise.

453
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:05,350
I'm talking about the
finding yourself just is as,

454
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,380
as as a first thing.

455
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,200
Yeah.

456
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,580
Well I'm a right wing guy.

457
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,241
Exactly.

458
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:11,610
Feel as what happened or have.

459
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,281
Exactly.

460
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:15,080
And what happens when
you do that is that you,

461
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,190
it's very hard not to take yourself
very seriously in that regard.

462
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:18,790
Right.

463
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,380
And,

464
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,750
and then you don't have room
to create because you're that,

465
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:23,740
that's what I'm talking about.

466
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:27,160
Those lines are very precious and you
don't want to break those lines because

467
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,330
then you don't know where to go.

468
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,470
Then you're in the danger zone.

469
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,053
You know it.

470
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,130
When you define yourself
very strongly like that,

471
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:34,440
it's kind of like a way of um,

472
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,260
uh,

473
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,220
protecting yourself.

474
00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:37,031
But I think someone like,

475
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:37,601
what's his name?

476
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:37,900
Um,

477
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,733
at the spider.

478
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,490
Um,

479
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:39,641
uh,

480
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:40,480
Anderson Silva.

481
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,051
He,

482
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:42,940
so he comes up dancing.

483
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:43,241
He,

484
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:44,650
that's part of his technique.

485
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:45,700
He's very loose.

486
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:46,900
He stays loose.

487
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,400
He doesn't take it too seriously.

488
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,990
Kind of raises his hands from Shell.

489
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,893
Someone's calling them out.

490
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,600
You know who Brian is the image down?

491
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,620
Huh?

492
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,360
There's the image down on Ustream image.

493
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,110
Yeah.

494
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,280
It's a big black screen.

495
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,630
It's lately use stream's
been weird with browsers.

496
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,510
Like lot of people are saying that the
sound doesn't work and stuff and it's

497
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:05,230
just,

498
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,880
I think a chrome mostly,

499
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,200
but it's amusing.

500
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,040
A safari.

501
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,263
What do you use?

502
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,010
These rooms are refreshed it,

503
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:12,740
it came back.

504
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,050
You,

505
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:13,391
by the way,

506
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:16,270
people watching this are
probably wondering why I'm
dressed like a professional

507
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:19,900
athlete because I look like
a professional soccer player.

508
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,550
I looked like a European soccer player.

509
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,413
Maybe rugby,

510
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,201
maybe rugby.

511
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:23,381
Dude,

512
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:24,220
I've got a thick neck.

513
00:14:24,221 --> 00:14:26,500
You can't tell right now
because I'm wearing a collar.

514
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:28,510
But I have a beautiful body under this.

515
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,181
What was your,

516
00:14:29,181 --> 00:14:30,730
what was your showtime special called?

517
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,780
It's called man class.

518
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,941
Madam clown.

519
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:33,774
Man Class.

520
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,660
Okay.

521
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,270
It's called man class
and it was ridiculous.

522
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,120
Uh,

523
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,640
I need to come up with a name for mine.

524
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,960
I've had very good feedback.

525
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:41,601
Thank you.

526
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:42,580
My main class,

527
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,960
um,

528
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,681
because I was,

529
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:45,071
I was like,

530
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:45,400
I'm gonna,

531
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:45,641
you know,

532
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:47,950
I'm talking about what it
is to be a man in 2012.

533
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:48,971
And I was like,

534
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,830
I'm just going to fucking
teach a math class right now.

535
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:51,771
And uh,

536
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:52,180
I'm,

537
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,490
I'm obsessed with this problem of
masculinity in a fucking world that's so

538
00:14:55,491 --> 00:14:56,271
technological.

539
00:14:56,271 --> 00:15:00,140
Like we're still producing testosterone
and we're aggressive and we have

540
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:00,500
nothing.

541
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,130
All we had to do it,

542
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,150
all we can do is simulate.

543
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:02,751
I go to the gym,

544
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:03,380
I'm working though.

545
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,700
I'm doing fucking kettlebells.

546
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,800
Why the fuck do I need to fuck?

547
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,351
You know,

548
00:15:07,351 --> 00:15:09,060
the to swing a kettle bell for,

549
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:13,370
but I got to keep my traps up to a buck
and I'm learning how to box my buddy

550
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,001
Karen Gallagher.

551
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:14,834
I'm like in my,

552
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,680
in my backyard.

553
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:15,831
He's,

554
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,990
please bring me through all
this stuff like Free Ryan.

555
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:18,890
Here's,

556
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:19,491
here's the deal.

557
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:23,810
Somewhere along the line we got
made to feel guilty for being manly,

558
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,340
for being men grove,

559
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,190
liking men shit for liking manly things.

560
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:31,460
We got somehow or another
we became guilty of that.

561
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,350
I think women,

562
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,450
you got to let chicks be chicks.

563
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,880
You got to let them wear
their crazy heels and they're,

564
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,300
they're nutty short
skirts and you know the,

565
00:15:40,301 --> 00:15:40,491
the,

566
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:42,410
the heels that you don't
understand the dresses,

567
00:15:42,411 --> 00:15:43,520
that don't mean anything to you.

568
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:45,140
But to them it's like super important.

569
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,050
That's all girly shit and
that's when you're into,

570
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:48,980
that's fine.

571
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,380
But if you're in the manly shit,

572
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,660
if you're in like man style things,

573
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,100
you're looked down upon like,

574
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:55,281
oh,

575
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:56,114
come on.

576
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,920
That's what makes me so angry.

577
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,900
That's what makes me so
angry because listen,

578
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:05,380
up until very fucking recently we've
had to fight and hunt for our own food.

579
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,630
You know how much you not
think about what kind of,

580
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:12,950
what kind of aggression and tasted get
on a horse or run to the forest and spear

581
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:17,120
a wild animal and then cut its throat
with a stone knife or just a regular

582
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:17,600
night.

583
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,890
You smelled that animal.

584
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,723
Yes,

585
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,750
I use a stone knife.

586
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:21,261
Personally,

587
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:22,250
I don't want to brag but I,

588
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,080
I like to hunt with stone tools.

589
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,970
I watched a whole special,

590
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:29,630
a believer who was on the history channel
where guys made bows and arrows the

591
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:31,650
traditional way like and,

592
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,840
and when hunting with it,

593
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,150
I just pitched a show to discovery about,

594
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,980
I'm with my Buddy Sam Sheridan,

595
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:37,814
who you know,

596
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,140
and,

597
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,080
and we're going to go and find all the
masculine pockets in a demasculated

598
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:42,914
America.

599
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,250
So we're basically going to find
guys in Hawaii who fund whole hunt,

600
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:49,040
wild boar using traditional Hawaiian,

601
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:53,990
like the ancient hunting tools like
stone spears and whatever the fuck it is.

602
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,990
And we're going to go find those groups.

603
00:16:56,991 --> 00:17:00,500
And just kind of like showcase these
groups and kind of join him and could be a

604
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:01,370
funny fucking show.

605
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,300
That's hilarious.

606
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:02,820
Yeah,

607
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,680
that'd be amazing.

608
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:05,060
There's a huge need for men.

609
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,211
You know,

610
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:06,710
women have an instinct to preen right?

611
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,810
They just have an instinct to print
in the like birds do you see them?

612
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:09,001
You know,

613
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:09,290
you need,

614
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,560
they've got 15 different lip glosses
and different creams and rubbing their

615
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:12,950
hair,

616
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:13,783
whatever the fuck it is.

617
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,980
Hundreds trope guys.

618
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:17,420
You know my joke about guys,

619
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,650
the criteria for guides,

620
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:21,200
the way they dress is they don't want
to look like a pussy and they got to be

621
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:21,740
comfortable.

622
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,670
That's all it is.

623
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,160
I fucking only loose hanging shit.

624
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,083
Okay.

625
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,711
And,

626
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:27,544
and um,

627
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,640
I even think that,

628
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:29,050
you know,

629
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,320
I,

630
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:29,900
it's,

631
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,770
I can't prove this,

632
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:32,300
but whenever you see a dude like,

633
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,410
like I always make this joke,

634
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:33,950
but it's true.

635
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,040
You if you're in Boston or parts of Long
Island in New York and you show up in a

636
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:37,500
cool,

637
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,500
you're a guy and you show up in like a
really sexy like hipster outfit and you

638
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:45,260
got like fucking awesome
bangles and you're,

639
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:46,310
you got a nose ring,

640
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,610
you can get beat up by just dude
just of the way you fucking look.

641
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,120
They're like,

642
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,990
I like that guy.

643
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,200
How come he's got a fucking
nose ring and he's got bangles?

644
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,610
I'm gonna Punch him in the face.

645
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,710
And I think it might be because those,

646
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,100
that guy's not part of our hunting party
cause all that fucking jewelry makes a

647
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:06,450
lot of noise and the fucking animals here
him and they smell his fucking Cologne

648
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,020
and they can,

649
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,920
they can smell that too.

650
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:11,130
So I'm going fucking hungry so you're
not my hunting party so I'm going to beat

651
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,230
you up because you represent hunger to me.

652
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,900
I really think that's part of like
what we have that instinct it.

653
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,560
That's a funny way of thinking about it.

654
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,820
I always thought it was just,

655
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:19,180
you know,

656
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,460
want some douche coming
around and dress like,

657
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:22,650
you know,

658
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,370
stealing my women like a pirate.

659
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,803
You know,

660
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,180
you don't want some dude who thinks he's
Johnny Depp in pirates of the Caribbean

661
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,300
is walking down your street,

662
00:18:31,301 --> 00:18:32,111
wear Mascara,

663
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:32,944
talking to girls.

664
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,880
Like what are you doing dude?

665
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,781
I fucking,

666
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:35,561
I live in Venice.

667
00:18:35,561 --> 00:18:35,861
Okay.

668
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:38,470
I see dudes with hoop
earrings and they're straight.

669
00:18:38,471 --> 00:18:39,490
If you're gay it's fine.

670
00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:40,360
You got away with a lot.

671
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:41,620
But I see guys just show up with,

672
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:41,920
like,

673
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,300
I saw a guy with a leather like,

674
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:43,890
like,

675
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,501
like a leather.

676
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:45,550
When you say hoop earrings,

677
00:18:45,551 --> 00:18:46,450
how big are these hoops?

678
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,620
They weren't very big.

679
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,540
Very fucking bank.

680
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:50,140
Okay.

681
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,090
Is that the dude thing
do to try to wear like

682
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,760
Diana Ross and the seventies theories?

683
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:57,700
He had Umaine have thick hair
that he tied with this awesome.

684
00:18:57,701 --> 00:18:58,151
Like Bo,

685
00:18:58,151 --> 00:18:58,631
part of it was,

686
00:18:58,631 --> 00:19:00,700
I was just jealous of the
fact that he has great hair,

687
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,541
but you know,

688
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:01,811
he had,

689
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:02,111
he had,

690
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:03,400
he looked like a fucking pirate.

691
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:03,701
He had,

692
00:19:03,701 --> 00:19:04,210
you know,

693
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,490
he had his jeans rolled
up just so with these,

694
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,660
oh,

695
00:19:08,661 --> 00:19:08,961
I was like,

696
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:10,100
where can I vote for you,

697
00:19:10,101 --> 00:19:10,640
dude?

698
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,391
Did you have both ears,

699
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:12,180
pierce?

700
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:12,500
No,

701
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,810
just the left just about had to piercings.

702
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:19,460
I had a lower one and then a diamond by
lower when he means his Dick Ladies and

703
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:20,110
gentlemen,

704
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,480
and then I tried to rock to
two hoops at the same time,

705
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:24,110
but I'll even,

706
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:24,711
I was like,

707
00:19:24,711 --> 00:19:26,000
what is too tough?

708
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,610
And then I tried to rock
to studs at the same time.

709
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,090
Then I'm like,

710
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:29,341
oh,

711
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:30,110
it's so stupid.

712
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,570
So that I went to one
tiny little hoop earring,

713
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,520
I think like somewhere around news,

714
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:36,610
radio and then Jujitsu,

715
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,870
just constantly taking it out to to role.

716
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,381
I just said,

717
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:40,214
this is stupid.

718
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,241
You get to staff.

719
00:19:41,241 --> 00:19:41,750
By the way,

720
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,280
have you tried to put one in recently?

721
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:45,310
I just tried it the other
day and it went right in.

722
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:45,531
I'm like,

723
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:46,364
Oh shit.

724
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,000
Rock.

725
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,960
Kind of hearing your head.

726
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,860
Both pierce though.

727
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,970
Did you think about doing it?

728
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,500
I did it for a day.

729
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:51,801
I like,

730
00:19:51,801 --> 00:19:52,730
I just as a joke,

731
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,010
my dad was an Irish,

732
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:55,940
like kind of marine,

733
00:19:55,941 --> 00:19:58,220
like just kind of a rough due
to grow up like on a farm.

734
00:19:58,221 --> 00:20:00,020
And the dude I shut up.

735
00:20:00,021 --> 00:20:03,620
Like if I shut up with a hat or
like just something cool at dinner,

736
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,940
he just do shit like this.

737
00:20:04,941 --> 00:20:07,100
He was just as big
fucking dude and he'd go,

738
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,930
why are you wearing that hat?

739
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,010
And that's how I would have asked me.

740
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:10,820
Or one time I,

741
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,900
I had a goatee,

742
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:13,040
I grew a mustache,

743
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:18,350
a little awesome soul patch on my chin
and I was going to Italy and I spent way

744
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:21,860
too much on clothes cause I was
going to be Italian and my father,

745
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,000
I was like,

746
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,580
I was like 28 my father looks
at me and he goes like this.

747
00:20:25,581 --> 00:20:26,330
He goes,

748
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,040
what's going on with your face?

749
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,223
And I go,

750
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:29,901
oh no.

751
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:31,890
I just thought I'd go out
mustache and a little goatee,

752
00:20:31,891 --> 00:20:32,101
you know,

753
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:32,330
and he,

754
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,110
and he goes,

755
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,943
yeah,

756
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,421
you get,

757
00:20:34,421 --> 00:20:34,720
you get to,

758
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,020
you're going to see how long
have you been aware of that?

759
00:20:36,021 --> 00:20:38,480
For around me kind of go,

760
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,261
you don't like it?

761
00:20:39,261 --> 00:20:39,980
He goes,

762
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,690
it's not

763
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,340
you thought you,

764
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:46,630
there is something weird about when you
go really try hard to change your image,

765
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,160
but one of those things where

766
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:53,190
it's really kind of dependent upon like
how transparent are your intentions or

767
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,440
are you just one of those dudes that
really can just pull that shit off like

768
00:20:56,441 --> 00:20:58,150
Joey Diaz could.

769
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,040
He could pull off anything you want.

770
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,800
If he really believed in it was
a hundred percent behind it.

771
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,840
Joey Diaz could start wearing jumpsuits
them back jumpsuits and fanny packs.

772
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,290
If he had a backpack everywhere of
Joey Diaz just all of a sudden started

773
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,720
wearing like running
suits with a backpack,

774
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,591
we would go,

775
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:15,040
all right.

776
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,090
I guess that's how he's doing it.

777
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:16,940
I,

778
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,210
I've never been able to,

779
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,010
that's the other reason is I just,

780
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:21,030
I don't know how to do it.

781
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:23,280
Like I'm really bad with
putting quality together.

782
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,510
Like I don't have any creativity,

783
00:21:24,511 --> 00:21:25,560
so like I was,

784
00:21:25,561 --> 00:21:26,880
when I shot my special,

785
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,540
I went to see this stylist and
the dude shows up and he's like,

786
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,770
he's got me in a hat.

787
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,090
I had a hat,

788
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,320
a fucking necklace,

789
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,280
and a blazer.

790
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,510
And by the way,

791
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,770
I looked outstanding walking out stay.

792
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,370
I was like,

793
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,290
I'm the best looking guy in America.

794
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:43,681
I was like,

795
00:21:43,681 --> 00:21:44,350
this is great.

796
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,183
Problem is,

797
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,780
I don't know how to wear a hat
or jewelry or a fucking blazer.

798
00:21:48,781 --> 00:21:49,591
It's too hot.

799
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:52,590
It feels too constrictive and I'm
doing it for the wrong reasons.

800
00:21:52,591 --> 00:21:52,891
I just,

801
00:21:52,891 --> 00:21:53,661
I'm doing it because I,

802
00:21:53,661 --> 00:21:57,450
I'd be very aware of the
fact that I looked awesome
or at least I'd act that way

803
00:21:57,451 --> 00:21:58,710
and I just can't do it.

804
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,910
That's worked well.

805
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,960
Being a comedian too,

806
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:03,880
you can only be so ridiculous.

807
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,440
I know.

808
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:05,861
You know,

809
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:06,880
you can only try.

810
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:10,930
So like w who wants to watch a comedian
go on stage dressed like he's trying to

811
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:11,620
get laid,

812
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,220
who wants to watch a comedian with like
skin tight shirts with the button up?

813
00:22:15,221 --> 00:22:16,060
What are those things called?

814
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,203
The that button,

815
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,030
the thermals or whatever.

816
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,500
But you know that style,

817
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,670
there's a style to,

818
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:26,750
it can't be too sexy and tie and pants
that are already have rips in them.

819
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,330
Like

820
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,300
Russell Grant,

821
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:28,961
you can do that,

822
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:29,561
but I don't really,

823
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:29,861
again,

824
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:31,300
I'm not as good looking as Russell brand.

825
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,010
I saw that the other day where the guy
had like his hair done up like nine oh

826
00:22:35,011 --> 00:22:36,300
two window like the slick,

827
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:36,540
like,

828
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,980
like poof and the top front.

829
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,490
And he had like the white shirt that kind
of was cut too low and then he like a

830
00:22:41,491 --> 00:22:46,140
little shell necklace thing going on
there and he was doing jokes about how

831
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:46,830
everyone,

832
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,221
everyone,

833
00:22:47,221 --> 00:22:47,610
you know,

834
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:51,510
confuses me with like Dillon from nine
oh 200 like he actually brought up the

835
00:22:51,511 --> 00:22:54,720
way he looked at it as an open Mike night.

836
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,141
No,

837
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:57,180
this was a show at a

838
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,770
Doug Davidoff tells real joke what's
based on a true story where a guy got out

839
00:23:00,771 --> 00:23:03,890
of a BMW when he first got to La and
tough grew up in a junk yard and jersey,

840
00:23:03,891 --> 00:23:04,340
you know,

841
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,090
so the guy,

842
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,260
the guy fucking gets out of it.

843
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,001
BMW,

844
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:08,840
the squaring kind of a Cape like a,

845
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:09,561
like a cape,

846
00:23:09,561 --> 00:23:10,880
like kind of a like a long,

847
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:11,900
it's not even a duster.

848
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,400
It's a Cape and a guy goes,

849
00:23:13,401 --> 00:23:13,491
hey,

850
00:23:13,491 --> 00:23:15,110
you know what time it is
and thought it was like,

851
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,940
you're just going to
ask me what time it is.

852
00:23:16,941 --> 00:23:18,530
Like you're not wearing a fucking cape.

853
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,680
It's time to take the fucking Cape off.

854
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,491
Fuck you doing.

855
00:23:22,491 --> 00:23:24,740
I'll punch you in the face right
now and I don't even know you.

856
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,700
It's so,

857
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,760
so hilarious,

858
00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:27,220
you know.

859
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,880
Have you seen that thing that Robert
Kelly where's he talks about it at once in

860
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:32,560
a while and opiate Anthony and it's like,

861
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:32,801
it's like,

862
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:33,280
um,

863
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,840
I can't remember the name of it,

864
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:39,040
but it's a like a fanny pack that
instead of having it around your crotch,

865
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,010
it's like this thing that goes from
like the left side to the right side.

866
00:23:42,011 --> 00:23:42,760
Like a seat

867
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,160
only Robert Kelly could
get away with that.

868
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:45,870
I love Robert Robert.

869
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,160
Yeah.

870
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,390
Robert could get away with it though.

871
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,560
It's a man purse.

872
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,070
You know,

873
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,530
as you get older and you're
not trying to get laid,

874
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,030
you start saying things like,

875
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:53,870
what the fuck?

876
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:55,490
Why don't I just have a purse?

877
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:59,270
He started saying shit
like sometimes I need,

878
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,890
I have cargo shorts on.

879
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:01,550
You know why?

880
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,540
Because I have a lot of shit.

881
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:03,560
I got my keys,

882
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,581
I got some money,

883
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:05,480
I got some gum.

884
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:05,920
The other,

885
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,350
I was just,

886
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,530
the other day I was in my car singing
at the top of my lungs and these girls

887
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,790
pulled up and usually
I would have been like,

888
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,180
ah,

889
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,320
I'll sing and I'm a fucking idiot.

890
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,653
I was like

891
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,700
singing as loud as I call it is a song.

892
00:24:16,701 --> 00:24:17,240
You're saying.

893
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,660
I was singing a new song by Springsteen
called death to our hometown.

894
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,171
Whoa.

895
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:22,220
You just went deep.

896
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,210
I shared dead guys.

897
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,710
You told me you had some sort of religious
experience at a Springsteen show I

898
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,130
had and I'm not joking.

899
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,270
I went and saw him.

900
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:30,021
He's 62.

901
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:30,980
I've seen Springsteen,

902
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:31,730
let's call it,

903
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,370
because I'm on the podcast and
I want to exaggerate 30 times.

904
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,660
It's probably closer to 15.

905
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,993
And uh,

906
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,380
and he's 62.

907
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,280
And,

908
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:40,580
uh,

909
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,930
well he's never been better.

910
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,760
He's writing songs on a level that he's
just as good as anything he's ever done.

911
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:47,811
And you know,

912
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:48,381
everybody else,

913
00:24:48,381 --> 00:24:49,131
the rolling stones,

914
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:50,390
you see it's a revival tour.

915
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:54,020
They're just singing the thing equals
this guy is still producing on a level

916
00:24:54,021 --> 00:24:56,300
that he was producing at
when he was 24 years old.

917
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:56,960
It's amazing.

918
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,130
It,

919
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,960
he's more than amazing
because he literally,

920
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,331
and,

921
00:25:00,331 --> 00:25:00,950
and this,

922
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,950
I was watching him and you know,

923
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,430
I was literally having,

924
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,200
this is going to sound really cheesy,

925
00:25:06,201 --> 00:25:07,400
but I'm a huge fan of his,

926
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:08,570
I became an actor because of him.

927
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,790
I became a standup because they,

928
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:12,200
him guy listen to his songs because
there was something in his voice.

929
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:16,100
But for me it was literally so
overwhelming cause he's so timeless.

930
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,490
Like he's aligned with something to dude.

931
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,590
And it's because what
motivates him is way more than,

932
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,150
than his own appetites.

933
00:25:23,151 --> 00:25:24,300
And what he wants to do,

934
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,950
what motivates him is something
much bigger than himself.

935
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,000
And I don't know what that is,

936
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:29,940
but probably you could feel it.

937
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,280
The love of all of those people.

938
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:32,990
He's got such a fanatical crowd.

939
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:33,230
Oh.

940
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:33,831
But it's also,

941
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:34,551
it's also though,

942
00:25:34,551 --> 00:25:36,290
it's also about saying something man,

943
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,410
but you know of of all those people
that are responding to what he said,

944
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:39,930
yeah,

945
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:43,430
that'd be an intense connection
that Springsteen has to his fans.

946
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:44,840
It's because of,

947
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,410
you know,

948
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,870
like it's like born to run.

949
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,171
There's,

950
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,440
there's songs that like people just you,

951
00:25:50,441 --> 00:25:53,750
you hear that and that's
like a slice of history.

952
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:54,111
Go,

953
00:25:54,111 --> 00:25:54,560
go to,

954
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,280
go to la,

955
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,690
go read the lyrics of greetings from
Asbury park and darkness on the edge of

956
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:03,530
town because what he was doing
there was literally like,

957
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:08,360
he kind of almost invented a language
that changed a lot of like the artistic

958
00:26:08,361 --> 00:26:09,320
landscape in New York.

959
00:26:09,321 --> 00:26:09,681
At least.

960
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:12,710
You know Sam Shepard was writing
plays based on that album.

961
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:13,190
Man,

962
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:17,660
no one has ever got rid of a chick that
was a problem in his life and wrote a

963
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:20,120
better song about it than Springsteen did.

964
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,103
The brilliant,

965
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,030
she's the one who ever hear that.

966
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:23,930
I don't know that one,

967
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:25,690
but I know brilliant disguise that.

968
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,570
I remember hearing that because
I was like early twenties when I,

969
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,580
when I heard that and I was,

970
00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:32,414
you know,

971
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,280
always in terrible relationships,

972
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:35,300
always chaos.

973
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,201
Some,

974
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:36,940
some of them will,

975
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,990
it just didn't work out because it you,

976
00:26:38,991 --> 00:26:39,920
some of it was because of her,

977
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,100
but you knew enough crazy
people in your life at a certain

978
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,700
point to realize that you could
get fucked in a relationship.

979
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:50,190
And when I saw that Bruce Springsteen
got fucked and then I realized,

980
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:50,470
I was like,

981
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,360
oh see what happened?

982
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,990
She was really high so she pretended to
be something and then he got close to

983
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:57,240
her and he got to know her
and she was kind of a cut.

984
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:57,690
Right

985
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,090
Ray?

986
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,700
Go listen to she's jungle land.

987
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,780
She's the one.

988
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,321
Oh yeah.

989
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:02,471
Oh,

990
00:27:02,471 --> 00:27:03,304
I know that song.

991
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,061
Fuck man.

992
00:27:04,061 --> 00:27:04,301
I mean,

993
00:27:04,301 --> 00:27:05,240
and back streets.

994
00:27:05,241 --> 00:27:05,800
Yeah,

995
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,080
like back streets is
about this by the way.

996
00:27:08,081 --> 00:27:08,920
This is the,

997
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,390
the,

998
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,830
the brilliant disguise
is like 15 years later,

999
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:12,911
oh my God,

1000
00:27:12,911 --> 00:27:13,570
he's that he,

1001
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,010
not only is he prolific like that,

1002
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,940
he's given songs away to people like
the pointer sisters and Patti Smith.

1003
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:20,950
And that was their
biggest hit because when,

1004
00:27:20,951 --> 00:27:22,780
if there's a documentary
called the promise,

1005
00:27:22,781 --> 00:27:23,560
where he'd,

1006
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,550
he'd been born or when was the biggest
album in the country and it was,

1007
00:27:27,551 --> 00:27:30,340
he was on the cover of Newsweek
and Time magazine was 24 years old.

1008
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,560
And then he went to write the promise,

1009
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:32,840
I,

1010
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,371
I'm sorry,

1011
00:27:33,371 --> 00:27:34,181
he went to write a,

1012
00:27:34,181 --> 00:27:34,690
um,

1013
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:39,550
darkness on the edge of town and they
wanted him to write more of the stuff from

1014
00:27:39,551 --> 00:27:40,680
born run like that Kinda,

1015
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,800
that's what his fans want.

1016
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,030
And not only that,

1017
00:27:43,031 --> 00:27:45,340
he was writing hit songs
and giving them away.

1018
00:27:45,341 --> 00:27:47,620
And Steve Man's hand was
like writing hit songs.

1019
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:48,670
It's so fucking hard.

1020
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,840
And he's giving them away.

1021
00:27:49,841 --> 00:27:51,100
And he comes into the studio and he goes,

1022
00:27:51,101 --> 00:27:51,760
well,

1023
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,830
let's see what we're
going to throw away today.

1024
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,970
And he sees Steve Van Zandt go,

1025
00:27:54,971 --> 00:27:55,840
please don't throw that song.

1026
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:55,961
Wait,

1027
00:27:55,961 --> 00:27:56,381
please don't.

1028
00:27:56,381 --> 00:27:57,250
It's so perfect please.

1029
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:57,701
And he's like,

1030
00:27:57,701 --> 00:27:58,690
it doesn't fit in the album.

1031
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,040
It just,

1032
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,920
just doesn't fit in the album.

1033
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,810
And he was so uncompromising
and they said,

1034
00:28:01,811 --> 00:28:02,330
what drove?

1035
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:02,830
He said,

1036
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,640
I want it to be great because I knew I
had an inside me and I wanted to be great

1037
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:09,660
and I wanted to do
something that nobody else.

1038
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,560
I just didn't want to
do anything derivative.

1039
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,300
And I,

1040
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,133
and I talked to him,

1041
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,080
I talked to him for an hour
and a half about songwriting,

1042
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,160
which is kind of exciting and I,

1043
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:16,990
I don't resist.

1044
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,580
I went back stage a long time ago.

1045
00:28:18,581 --> 00:28:20,290
Jeremy Pivot and uh,

1046
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:20,950
and I,

1047
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:24,640
I literally talked about standup and about
writing songs for an hour and a half.

1048
00:28:24,641 --> 00:28:25,301
It was just me,

1049
00:28:25,301 --> 00:28:25,601
him,

1050
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:25,991
Jeremy,

1051
00:28:25,991 --> 00:28:28,200
his wife and my buddy Anthony Tan Backus,

1052
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,650
who's going to be my next guest.

1053
00:28:29,651 --> 00:28:30,640
And the Brian Callen Pie.

1054
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:31,061
Uh,

1055
00:28:31,061 --> 00:28:32,810
the Brian counts the 10 Backus.

1056
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,320
He wrote warrior and he's,

1057
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:39,010
we had a warrior was a good movie and
that movie did not get nearly enough for

1058
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:39,340
spray.

1059
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:39,890
It really did.

1060
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,170
I was surprised.

1061
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,441
No,

1062
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:41,771
it was,

1063
00:28:41,771 --> 00:28:42,730
my wife's loved it.

1064
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:43,810
It's great movies.

1065
00:28:43,811 --> 00:28:44,644
It's a good movie.

1066
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,590
The only unrealistic thing is that
they fought two days in a row.

1067
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,530
They didn't have to do that there.

1068
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:52,180
That could have been worked out well
because Anthony [inaudible] and Gavin,

1069
00:28:52,181 --> 00:28:53,290
who's the director and they wrote it,

1070
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:53,421
they,

1071
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:53,701
they,

1072
00:28:53,701 --> 00:28:53,891
they,

1073
00:28:53,891 --> 00:28:54,400
they're not,

1074
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,500
they don't know a lot about
fighting and that's all they were.

1075
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,030
They were more concerned with the story,

1076
00:28:58,031 --> 00:28:58,800
you know,

1077
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,260
but,

1078
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,190
but it was still good.

1079
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,920
It was still good even though that,

1080
00:29:01,921 --> 00:29:03,070
that was kind of nonsensical.

1081
00:29:03,071 --> 00:29:04,070
It was still still front.

1082
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,140
It's a very good movie.

1083
00:29:05,141 --> 00:29:06,430
It's a great move of God damn.

1084
00:29:06,431 --> 00:29:07,360
Nick Nolte tease a mother,

1085
00:29:07,361 --> 00:29:07,740
father,

1086
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,531
oh my God.

1087
00:29:08,531 --> 00:29:11,050
As a mother fucker who just
showed up and just did that.

1088
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,610
And did that take 50 times,

1089
00:29:12,611 --> 00:29:13,421
like literally there's like,

1090
00:29:13,421 --> 00:29:13,631
what do you,

1091
00:29:13,631 --> 00:29:14,710
what else do you want guys?

1092
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:15,640
Oh my God.

1093
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,410
If people don't know
what we're talking about,

1094
00:29:17,411 --> 00:29:18,430
there's a breakdown scene.

1095
00:29:18,431 --> 00:29:18,801
Nick Nolte,

1096
00:29:18,801 --> 00:29:21,400
he's a recovering alcoholic who
was a terrible father and he,

1097
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,640
he basically gave birth to
these two savages that meet
in the finals of this MMA

1098
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,521
tournament,

1099
00:29:27,521 --> 00:29:28,360
which by the way,

1100
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:31,990
is a very accurate
statement for many fighters.

1101
00:29:31,991 --> 00:29:34,120
There's a lot of fighters
that grew up broken homes,

1102
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,740
fucked up households.

1103
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,341
You know,

1104
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:37,174
a lot of,

1105
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,710
a lot of fighters grew up,

1106
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,050
you know,

1107
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:39,331
in,

1108
00:29:39,331 --> 00:29:39,640
in,

1109
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,470
in dire straits as from some asshole
father that and a lot of those asshole

1110
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:48,070
fathers even wind up teaching those kids
at first just like his dad did in this

1111
00:29:48,071 --> 00:29:48,401
movie.

1112
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:50,080
So it was really accurate.

1113
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,370
Like the way they did it.

1114
00:29:51,371 --> 00:29:52,150
It wasn't,

1115
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,170
didn't seem fake.

1116
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:55,090
The interactions like
what's that dude's name?

1117
00:29:55,091 --> 00:29:55,780
Tom.

1118
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,380
Tom Hardy.

1119
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:56,920
Tom Hardy's,

1120
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,810
what a bad mother fucker.

1121
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,140
He's English to England.

1122
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,210
But his interactions with the father,

1123
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:01,570
we're so,

1124
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,890
it was so realistic.

1125
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:04,240
It was so believable.

1126
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,010
Well Anthony Anthony had a very,

1127
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:06,690
um,

1128
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:07,511
it doesn't talk to his dad.

1129
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:07,631
You know,

1130
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:08,111
he had a very,

1131
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:10,540
very tough childhood with his father.

1132
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:12,100
His father was known as
the guy who wrote it.

1133
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,300
So,

1134
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:13,710
you know,

1135
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,000
uh,

1136
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,250
if there's a lot of personal shit and he,

1137
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:16,770
what's his last 10 back at back?

1138
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,400
We just did a podcast and he was so,

1139
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,340
it was so much fun to talk to them
about art and about what's important.

1140
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:23,350
And he's just one of those
fucking guys who really,

1141
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,210
I'll tell you what,

1142
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,930
he nailed that movie cause that's a,

1143
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:27,370
that's a tire genre.

1144
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,200
It's the martial arts champion though.

1145
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:32,320
The good guy's going to rise
above and dude for his kids.

1146
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:33,370
Right.

1147
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:33,941
It's a tire.

1148
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:38,590
John [inaudible] and he really
connected and I was really good.

1149
00:30:38,591 --> 00:30:39,101
It was,

1150
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:39,881
it sucked man.

1151
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:40,840
I was really bummed out.

1152
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:45,400
That movie didn't get nearly as much
attention as it deserves out yet on DVD or

1153
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:47,920
anything for a while is the
number one DVD in the country.

1154
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,390
It's a good fucking movie man.

1155
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:49,780
I mean it's,

1156
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,080
yeah.

1157
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,710
Like I said,

1158
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,370
the only thing that bothered me
as a non realism about the upbeat,

1159
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,071
you can't do,

1160
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:55,420
if you tried to fight two days in a row,

1161
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:56,890
your whole face would be swollen.

1162
00:30:56,891 --> 00:30:57,671
Your your hands.

1163
00:30:57,671 --> 00:30:59,050
You wouldn't be able to close your hands.

1164
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,101
You can't do it.

1165
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:01,300
You can't fight two days in a row.

1166
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,253
It's too hard.

1167
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,000
It's hard to fight more than once a day.

1168
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,751
I've done it.

1169
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:07,240
The last kickboxing tournament
I fought three times in one day.

1170
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,550
It's stupid.

1171
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:08,820
Yeah,

1172
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,080
it's,

1173
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,610
it's wrestling tournaments.

1174
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,260
We used to wrestle more than,

1175
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,190
you know like if you go into
like a a tournament sunrise,

1176
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,190
it was two days long or
even it was one day long.

1177
00:31:18,191 --> 00:31:20,020
You a lot of times you
arrested at least three times.

1178
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,880
Total problem was there was no head
contact and wrestling and the head contact

1179
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,560
and kickboxing and MMA like that's
why you can't do it two days in a row.

1180
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,453
You just can't,

1181
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:31,730
you know,

1182
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,520
you get rocked the the first day,

1183
00:31:33,521 --> 00:31:35,440
the next day you need fucking arrest man.

1184
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,230
You can't be go getting actually actually
really dangerous too if you have,

1185
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:39,970
sure you have a mild concussion
and you get hit again.

1186
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,270
A lot of guys get concussed and still
when it happens all the time they get in

1187
00:31:43,271 --> 00:31:46,960
cost and make it to the final
round and the final round ends,

1188
00:31:46,961 --> 00:31:49,330
they go back to sit in the
corner and the the the,

1189
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,321
you know the corner,

1190
00:31:50,321 --> 00:31:51,310
we'll tell them the fights over.

1191
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,080
That happened recently
with Alex because Sarah's,

1192
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,520
he got head kicked I think,

1193
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:55,960
I believe it was in the second round.

1194
00:31:55,961 --> 00:31:58,540
He got head kicked and at the end of
the third round he couldn't believe the

1195
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,260
fight was over.

1196
00:31:59,260 --> 00:31:59,501
He's like,

1197
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:00,251
what are you talking about?

1198
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,180
The fight just started.

1199
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:01,820
He goes and they go,

1200
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:01,991
wow,

1201
00:32:01,991 --> 00:32:02,460
it's over.

1202
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,221
He was like,

1203
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:03,641
come on man,

1204
00:32:03,641 --> 00:32:04,660
you guys are playing with me.

1205
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,553
Did he win?

1206
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:05,980
Uh,

1207
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,813
no he did not.

1208
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,380
I believe he lost the decision.

1209
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:09,640
It was a really close fight.

1210
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:13,570
It was a crazy fight and he actually came
back from getting head kicked and was

1211
00:32:13,571 --> 00:32:14,560
doing really well.

1212
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,730
It was really amazing.

1213
00:32:15,731 --> 00:32:16,390
It was.

1214
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:19,720
He just got hit with a really hard
shot and that's just part of the game,

1215
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:20,171
you know the,

1216
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,340
the human head is,

1217
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:21,881
what's it,

1218
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:24,910
what's it doing to you that your
ring side for all that violence?

1219
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,410
I'm really numb to it.

1220
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,310
It's really strange.

1221
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,640
I've seen like street fights
like up close and personal,

1222
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:31,251
you know,

1223
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:33,130
like I've seen shit go down
like right in front of me.

1224
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,850
No,

1225
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,080
it doesn't even skip a beat.

1226
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:36,910
It's like everything's
moving in slow motion.

1227
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,320
It's real weird.

1228
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:38,660
Like,

1229
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,140
I've,

1230
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,381
I've,

1231
00:32:39,381 --> 00:32:40,250
I've gotten so

1232
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,940
used to watching people beat the fuck
out of each other on a high level,

1233
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:44,631
like the highest,

1234
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:48,590
the highest level in the world
from feet away and then calling it,

1235
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,151
you know,

1236
00:32:49,151 --> 00:32:49,760
and you know,

1237
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,340
and it's an honor to do really,

1238
00:32:52,341 --> 00:32:53,210
I really say that.

1239
00:32:53,211 --> 00:32:53,930
And you know,

1240
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,920
people say it sounds,

1241
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,820
it almost sounds kind of like a false
statement until you say it's an honor,

1242
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,750
but it's one of those things.

1243
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:00,151
There were the,

1244
00:33:00,151 --> 00:33:02,240
the word honor doesn't get used.

1245
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,450
It gets judiciously kind of tossed out.

1246
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:05,931
It's actually,

1247
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:07,220
it's actually used it,

1248
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,420
I don't think it's used enough.

1249
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,090
Honor is something when
a man talks about honor,

1250
00:33:11,091 --> 00:33:11,450
it's like,

1251
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:11,631
oh,

1252
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:12,860
you're old fashioned and stuff.

1253
00:33:12,861 --> 00:33:14,480
But honors very important.

1254
00:33:14,481 --> 00:33:16,400
It's a very important
word and a sacred words.

1255
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:17,181
It's very important.

1256
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:18,014
That's why,

1257
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,501
you know,

1258
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:19,190
if I'm,

1259
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:21,950
if I'm doing any sort of commentary on it,

1260
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,813
if I'm,

1261
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:27,820
I feel like I have this massive obligation
to say exactly what I think is going

1262
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:28,670
on.

1263
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,330
If this guy,

1264
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:32,570
you know why I think this guy
is getting hit with this sorta,

1265
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,660
sorta shot while he's moving a certain
direction and it gets to the point

1266
00:33:35,661 --> 00:33:39,890
sometimes we're fighters will think
that I'm being disrespectful and well I

1267
00:33:39,891 --> 00:33:41,660
don't know if that's true
because I've never seen it.

1268
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:43,910
I've had conversations with guys
and I've got to tell him I'm,

1269
00:33:43,911 --> 00:33:44,511
I look good man.

1270
00:33:44,511 --> 00:33:45,320
I'm just critical.

1271
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,101
If I can see it,

1272
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:46,880
it's there.

1273
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,720
If I can see a whole,

1274
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:48,290
it's there.

1275
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,760
It doesn't mean you can't
win with that whole,

1276
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:50,541
but if I see a whole,

1277
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:51,650
it's there and if you get mad at me,

1278
00:33:51,651 --> 00:33:54,080
cause I'm pointing out a hole
in your game that doesn't,

1279
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,010
that's silly.

1280
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:55,820
You shouldn't,

1281
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,930
I'm not criticizing you.

1282
00:33:56,931 --> 00:33:57,081
I'm,

1283
00:33:57,081 --> 00:34:00,860
I'm looking at the whole thing as a
mathematical proposition and I'm saying,

1284
00:34:00,861 --> 00:34:01,694
here's an entry,

1285
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,500
here's an entryway and here's,

1286
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:04,790
here's the issue with this,

1287
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:06,350
this one particular attack.

1288
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,060
You've always had enormous
respect for fighters.

1289
00:34:08,061 --> 00:34:10,730
And one of the things that I think that
you're so good at and a lot of people

1290
00:34:10,731 --> 00:34:11,211
have said this,

1291
00:34:11,211 --> 00:34:14,300
is you take yourself
completely out of the equation.

1292
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,580
That's a very hard thing
to balance actually,

1293
00:34:16,581 --> 00:34:18,830
because when you're calling
a fight and you have to be,

1294
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,170
you have to call if you,

1295
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:20,630
you know,

1296
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,470
you know fighting,

1297
00:34:21,471 --> 00:34:22,330
you've been watching it and you,

1298
00:34:22,331 --> 00:34:22,611
you know,

1299
00:34:22,611 --> 00:34:25,010
for many years now and
you've been doing it,

1300
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,320
you do see where there's a whole,

1301
00:34:27,321 --> 00:34:31,130
and so the balancing act
as calling that but not,

1302
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,271
not saying,

1303
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:34,190
well I would have done
something different.

1304
00:34:34,191 --> 00:34:35,750
You're always very careful about that.

1305
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,140
You know,

1306
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,140
that's the grossest thing that anybody
ever does when they do commentary.

1307
00:34:39,141 --> 00:34:39,471
Well,

1308
00:34:39,471 --> 00:34:40,131
if I was me,

1309
00:34:40,131 --> 00:34:41,540
I would go in there and
hit him with a left,

1310
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:41,810
right?

1311
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:42,643
No items.

1312
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,660
You got no idea what it's like gross.

1313
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,890
When I hear commentators,

1314
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,520
not,

1315
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,740
it doesn't happen very
often with MMA commentators,

1316
00:34:48,741 --> 00:34:52,970
but with these prognosticator
type characters that make
predictions on fights,

1317
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,970
I don't think he's going to be able
to hand and they'll use like numbers,

1318
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:56,151
like,

1319
00:34:56,151 --> 00:34:57,980
oh think he's gotta be
able to handle it to three.

1320
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:58,461
You know,

1321
00:34:58,461 --> 00:35:00,440
when he shoots the double
and can't handle that two,

1322
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:04,370
three [inaudible] kind
of bananas you like,

1323
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:05,630
you're going to predict the future.

1324
00:35:05,631 --> 00:35:06,141
Talk like,

1325
00:35:06,141 --> 00:35:06,590
stop.

1326
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,020
I'll tell you something that
I had an experience though.

1327
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,050
My Buddy Karen Gallagher,

1328
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:09,741
who was a stunt man,

1329
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:12,560
but a lot of guys who
are real MMA guys know,

1330
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,650
know who he is because he came
out of a University of Arizona,

1331
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,680
Arizona state I think and uh,

1332
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,060
uh,

1333
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,770
was uh,

1334
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:19,251
high level,

1335
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:23,300
like a black belt in Jiu Jitsu from Hagen
Machado's and I was a pro boxer by the

1336
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:23,870
time he was in college.

1337
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:27,290
He had 24 pro fights is a box or
something and really knows his stuff.

1338
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,400
And he's been teaching me like just,

1339
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:32,240
he's got all kinds of crazy tricks and
I watched the last fights with him.

1340
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:32,890
I watched it,

1341
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,580
I was with him and I was
with a group of people.

1342
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:36,680
I got witnesses like will
Sasso there and stuff.

1343
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,210
The dude not only called every fight,

1344
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,011
but he was going to,

1345
00:35:40,011 --> 00:35:42,300
he told me what was going to
happen before they would do it.

1346
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:42,451
Like,

1347
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:44,210
oh here comes the single leg here.

1348
00:35:44,211 --> 00:35:45,270
Cause it was so amazing.

1349
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:45,830
And I said,

1350
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,110
dude,

1351
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:46,411
Karen,

1352
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,810
you called every single
fight and not only that,

1353
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:50,190
you told me what was happening before.

1354
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:50,401
He goes,

1355
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:51,450
I haven't done that for 10 years,

1356
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,120
but he knows the game that well,

1357
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:54,941
but you'd never know it.

1358
00:35:54,941 --> 00:35:57,180
And he's just a stunt man
now and you know he's to be,

1359
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,870
he's gonna probably do
commentary for somebody.

1360
00:35:58,890 --> 00:35:59,131
Dude,

1361
00:35:59,131 --> 00:35:59,520
he's,

1362
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,031
he's not,

1363
00:36:00,031 --> 00:36:01,140
that's not his personality.

1364
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,310
He's not going to do that.

1365
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:02,701
He didn't just,

1366
00:36:02,701 --> 00:36:03,070
you know,

1367
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,130
but if somebody knows if you,

1368
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,973
you know the guy,

1369
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,550
he's a hook them up with like
shark fights or something.

1370
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,360
He's done an awesome comic.

1371
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,301
Uncanny.

1372
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:14,490
He's one of those guys
who's really intelligent.

1373
00:36:14,491 --> 00:36:15,280
Like he's a stunt man.

1374
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,440
I know he's a high level fives.

1375
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:16,840
Ilo.

1376
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,320
I talk them into doing it and he's right.

1377
00:36:18,321 --> 00:36:19,320
He's also read every book.

1378
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,350
I started mentioning books with Anthony
who was a writer who wrote a novel.

1379
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,740
He starts mentioning like everybody
from Charles Bukowski to cure a whack to

1380
00:36:25,741 --> 00:36:27,210
fucking Norman mailer.

1381
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,760
He's read them all in my
read more than I have.

1382
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,530
I go with the fuck.

1383
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,200
I go,

1384
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,040
have you read all these books?

1385
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:32,310
He goes,

1386
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:32,881
I read everything.

1387
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:33,580
Did.

1388
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:37,100
I mentioned obscure book called up
called extreme fear that Sam Sheridan

1389
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,400
recommended that I'm never reading now.

1390
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:38,881
Fascinating.

1391
00:36:38,881 --> 00:36:39,210
He goes,

1392
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:39,421
yeah,

1393
00:36:39,421 --> 00:36:40,170
I read it.

1394
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,060
What the fuck you're talking about?

1395
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,530
And it starts giving
me a critique about it.

1396
00:36:43,531 --> 00:36:44,240
I was like,

1397
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,480
suddenly they have a lot of free time.

1398
00:36:45,481 --> 00:36:47,340
I think he's got a lot
of free time sometimes.

1399
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,470
He's also really special smart guy.

1400
00:36:49,471 --> 00:36:50,191
Like I like,

1401
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:51,120
he's a genuine friend,

1402
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:52,290
like he's just a really,

1403
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:53,124
really smart guy.

1404
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,020
But I mean like when you're on a set,

1405
00:36:55,021 --> 00:36:57,450
like there's a lot of
times like especially like,

1406
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,980
I don't know if the
fear factor said it was,

1407
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:02,100
it was indicative of how it would be in
a movie like stunt guys on a movie set,

1408
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:03,570
but there's a lot of downtime.

1409
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,950
There's a lot of times they're setting
things up and there's a lot of,

1410
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,510
he's also one of the few Steinman who,

1411
00:37:08,511 --> 00:37:13,230
who was a really actually a professional
fighter and still rolls with Olympians

1412
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,540
and still fucking has an MMA gym.

1413
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:15,810
You know,

1414
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,850
why don't you talk this
guy into doing commentary,

1415
00:37:17,851 --> 00:37:18,440
man,

1416
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:18,961
it seems like,

1417
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:19,350
look,

1418
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,170
a lot of people probably don't
think that it could be possible.

1419
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,580
That's why they don't want to do it.

1420
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,110
They don't think that it could be real.

1421
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:25,291
Well,

1422
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:25,771
you know what I mean?

1423
00:37:25,771 --> 00:37:26,640
They don't even think about it.

1424
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:27,870
This isn't even could pop into their head,

1425
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,750
but the guy knows that much is
the entertaining to talk to.

1426
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:31,021
Yeah,

1427
00:37:31,021 --> 00:37:31,381
he's really,

1428
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:32,020
really smart.

1429
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,780
Then it sounds like he's perfect.

1430
00:37:33,781 --> 00:37:34,471
Somebody hire him.

1431
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:37,880
He's probably better than me because
nobody's better than you tell the UFC.

1432
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,753
Nobody's better than you.

1433
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:39,781
That's not true.

1434
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:40,441
That's ridiculous.

1435
00:37:40,441 --> 00:37:41,470
I don't know anybody's better than you.

1436
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,890
And I think Mike Goldman
has unbelievable too.

1437
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,460
He's great.

1438
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,293
I think it's unbelievable.

1439
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,790
You guys are the perfect
fucking combination.

1440
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:48,810
Kohlberg is a good dude.

1441
00:37:48,811 --> 00:37:49,230
You know?

1442
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,570
One of the good things about
like working with them.

1443
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,710
I enjoy that guy.

1444
00:37:52,711 --> 00:37:53,580
I enjoy his company.

1445
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:53,840
Yeah,

1446
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,840
you've told me hanging out.

1447
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,681
He's a nice guy,

1448
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:55,891
man.

1449
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:57,120
He's a sweetheart of a guy.

1450
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,320
He's always nice.

1451
00:37:58,321 --> 00:38:00,600
He's always hugging everybody
and always friendly.

1452
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,591
He's a sweet,

1453
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:02,460
positive guy.

1454
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,031
You know?

1455
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,610
So I liked being around
him and he's fucking good.

1456
00:38:05,611 --> 00:38:05,970
He's,

1457
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,470
he's a great play by play guy,

1458
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:07,711
man.

1459
00:38:07,711 --> 00:38:08,281
He's smooth.

1460
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:09,114
It's fuck.

1461
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,980
He knows how to kill the poetic,

1462
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:11,880
he's really poetic.

1463
00:38:11,881 --> 00:38:12,181
Like he's,

1464
00:38:12,181 --> 00:38:12,541
he's like,

1465
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:12,961
I really,

1466
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:14,490
people could take him
and they criticize him,

1467
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:15,051
but you're,

1468
00:38:15,051 --> 00:38:19,770
you're criticizing like one or two weird
things and he might've said while we're

1469
00:38:19,771 --> 00:38:22,650
free ball and for fucking hours at a time,

1470
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,120
six hours at a time,

1471
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,740
several times a month,

1472
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,341
you know,

1473
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:27,780
you got to realize like you look man,

1474
00:38:27,781 --> 00:38:29,880
you're going to find some
stupid shit that everybody says.

1475
00:38:29,881 --> 00:38:31,110
If you look at it for that long.

1476
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,953
Speaking of free balling,

1477
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,960
I just did the Adam Carolla podcast.

1478
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,650
He's so unbelievable at coming up with
like one premise and just being fucking

1479
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:39,461
hilarious.

1480
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:40,750
He was on the podcast.

1481
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:45,751
I credited you as to saying that he's
like the best guy at improvisation in and

1482
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,530
coming up with like a whole rant on a set,

1483
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,930
like the best rant guide,

1484
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,840
like real and real bits.

1485
00:38:52,841 --> 00:38:53,641
Like literally like,

1486
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:54,040
I'm busy.

1487
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,850
I'm like,

1488
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:55,541
I said,

1489
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,111
do you ever do stand up?

1490
00:38:56,111 --> 00:38:56,331
He goes,

1491
00:38:56,331 --> 00:38:56,591
Nah,

1492
00:38:56,591 --> 00:38:57,370
I go,

1493
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,710
you have five hours a
fucking material now.

1494
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:00,570
He's doing stand up now.

1495
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:01,120
And I dunno,

1496
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,430
he's,

1497
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,410
he does well he does.

1498
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,490
He does the podcast,

1499
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,570
which is stand up in front of an,

1500
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:04,990
oh no,

1501
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:05,910
he's doing standup.

1502
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,620
I was doing,

1503
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:06,981
yeah.

1504
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:07,201
Yeah.

1505
00:39:07,201 --> 00:39:08,680
He was doing regular standup.

1506
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:09,130
He,

1507
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:09,430
uh,

1508
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,180
he did a show at the Irvine Improv and um,

1509
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,240
it was a one of,

1510
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,690
I did one of his live podcasts,

1511
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:18,490
which I liked,

1512
00:39:18,491 --> 00:39:18,850
but I,

1513
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:21,250
I don't like as much because it's just,

1514
00:39:21,251 --> 00:39:22,600
it's a completely different thing,

1515
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,171
but when you're,

1516
00:39:23,171 --> 00:39:23,781
when you're live,

1517
00:39:23,781 --> 00:39:24,614
they're looking at me funny.

1518
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,050
They're not going to be salient.

1519
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,261
Well,

1520
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:28,330
I felt like it's not even
that it's a felt like,

1521
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:28,980
why don't we even talk,

1522
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,490
I should be doing standup right now.

1523
00:39:30,491 --> 00:39:31,900
I shouldn't be sitting here talking.

1524
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:35,080
There's 300 people that want to laugh
their ass off and I can do that.

1525
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:35,914
I get you to laugh,

1526
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,390
but let's just to stand up,

1527
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:37,930
you know?

1528
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:41,470
But I didn't want them putting my stand
up on the Internet because it was like,

1529
00:39:41,471 --> 00:39:43,450
this is all stuff that I was
going to put in my next album.

1530
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:43,781
I was like,

1531
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:44,261
I don't even know.

1532
00:39:44,261 --> 00:39:45,500
You can't just put that on your pod.

1533
00:39:45,501 --> 00:39:46,060
Right.

1534
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,140
That's like Byron Allen,

1535
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:48,700
you haven't seen that show.

1536
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,421
He did called.

1537
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:49,770
Um,

1538
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:52,160
cuts the comic sit down or unleashed.

1539
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:52,780
Meanwhile,

1540
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,311
I get there,

1541
00:39:53,311 --> 00:39:56,260
I'll make suddenly you want me to do,

1542
00:39:56,261 --> 00:40:01,250
you're paying me 150 bucks or whatever
it is to do like my act 20 minutes of my

1543
00:40:01,251 --> 00:40:01,740
ag.

1544
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,573
Nah.

1545
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:02,941
Yeah.

1546
00:40:02,941 --> 00:40:05,030
What the anchor not
doing that and it gets,

1547
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:05,921
they could fuck,

1548
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:09,970
I'd probably sell it and syndication EOD,

1549
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:10,790
right.

1550
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:11,441
Like you'll be like,

1551
00:40:11,441 --> 00:40:11,591
hey,

1552
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:12,610
what's up with your hair?

1553
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:15,310
He prompts you and then you go in
your bit and I'm watching guys,

1554
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,800
I'm watching guys give up 20 minutes.

1555
00:40:17,801 --> 00:40:19,360
It took them like fucking three years.

1556
00:40:19,361 --> 00:40:19,730
I'm like,

1557
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,190
you out of your fucking mind.

1558
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:21,761
Well,

1559
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:22,750
the worst is there.

1560
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:27,580
There's some shows I'm sure where they
own that material now and you're not

1561
00:40:27,581 --> 00:40:29,290
allowed to repeat that material.

1562
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:29,830
You know,

1563
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,530
if you do it,

1564
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:33,880
I'm sure there's contracts that if
I don't know what's actually though,

1565
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:35,320
I just might think on showtime.

1566
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:35,531
They,

1567
00:40:35,531 --> 00:40:35,800
they,

1568
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,580
they were,

1569
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,140
there's like dad some stipulation,

1570
00:40:38,141 --> 00:40:39,940
but I was able to do stuff on,

1571
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,810
I just did the comedy central's Mashup
where I have to rear up on a horse by the

1572
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:44,440
way.

1573
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,220
I mentioned that.

1574
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:45,810
Whoa.

1575
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,150
Yeah,

1576
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:46,571
I'll be,

1577
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:47,020
um,

1578
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,040
I believe like if you,

1579
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,650
they're going to take my standup bit
where I rescue a bunch of women on

1580
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:52,240
horseback and they're
surrounded by wolves.

1581
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:52,900
It's called the wolf.

1582
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,250
Cause Yeah.

1583
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,900
I talk about really heavy
shit with my stand up.

1584
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:56,511
But,

1585
00:40:56,511 --> 00:40:57,090
but um,

1586
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:57,400
I I,

1587
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:01,000
but I'm coming to your standup is
so fucking silly and you're such a,

1588
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:01,901
when I talked to you,

1589
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:04,150
you're such an intense and
serious guy and I'll do it.

1590
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,970
Cause like yesterday I just
did a fucking whole standup.

1591
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,940
I did 20 minutes on
saving a whale and they,

1592
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,220
and they were fucking dying.

1593
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:13,480
And I love the bit,

1594
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,740
it's so funny.

1595
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:15,730
So what's wrong with it?

1596
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,710
You say that with like
reluctantly nothing.

1597
00:41:17,711 --> 00:41:18,191
I don't know.

1598
00:41:18,191 --> 00:41:19,120
I just can't help it.

1599
00:41:19,121 --> 00:41:20,290
I start thinking silly.

1600
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,130
Yes.

1601
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:21,491
I just,

1602
00:41:21,491 --> 00:41:21,651
I,

1603
00:41:21,651 --> 00:41:22,570
I guess I just,

1604
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:26,650
I start laughing at the idea of saving a
fucking whale and then I didn't save it

1605
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:30,240
and I had to sit on its
blowhole kill it and no,

1606
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:34,330
cause I didn't want it to die of dryness
so I had to sit on its blow and uh,

1607
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:34,701
anyway,

1608
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:35,660
but it was fucking retarded.

1609
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,231
But they loved it.

1610
00:41:36,231 --> 00:41:36,491
So,

1611
00:41:36,491 --> 00:41:36,830
um,

1612
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:37,190
you know,

1613
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:37,920
I don't know dude.

1614
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,630
I uh,

1615
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:38,760
uh,

1616
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,300
now I'm now my next hour
that I'm working on.

1617
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:42,140
It's a little bit different.

1618
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:45,310
I'm dealing with larger
motifs and larger teeth.

1619
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,580
She'd been living in Venice too long.

1620
00:41:46,581 --> 00:41:49,790
So we need to get you to come back
out here to Saint Gabriel Valley.

1621
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:50,630
I got to get to find that.

1622
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,440
Brian,

1623
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,520
what the fuck did he just say?

1624
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,140
So you understand that at all guys.

1625
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,600
Sorry if someone said
that in front of you,

1626
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:57,810
would you get disgusting guy?

1627
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:58,041
Sorry,

1628
00:41:58,041 --> 00:41:58,874
I'm very educated.

1629
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,500
I'm highly educated,

1630
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:01,490
highly educated,

1631
00:42:01,491 --> 00:42:03,260
sophisticated zip up boots.

1632
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,011
Count Myself.

1633
00:42:04,011 --> 00:42:04,910
Got It all.

1634
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,793
It is weird.

1635
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,360
It is weird seeing you hang out
with different people though.

1636
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:10,490
Cause it seems like certain
people you act different,

1637
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:10,821
you know,

1638
00:42:10,821 --> 00:42:12,860
like you're more sillier
when you're with the me mean.

1639
00:42:12,861 --> 00:42:13,051
I'm a,

1640
00:42:13,051 --> 00:42:14,600
because I mean I'm a chameleon.

1641
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,750
You mean like my sister
who calls me the chameleon?

1642
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,030
You know what my buddy Anthony
Tan back has said about me.

1643
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,450
He goes,

1644
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,440
you know Brian Walks,

1645
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,460
if Brian walks,

1646
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,950
it takes a walk with
seven Cherokees when he,

1647
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:25,371
well,

1648
00:42:25,371 --> 00:42:25,601
you know,

1649
00:42:25,601 --> 00:42:27,550
it comes back a Cherokees.

1650
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:28,760
I was like,

1651
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,001
ah,

1652
00:42:29,001 --> 00:42:29,720
fuck,

1653
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,440
shut off.

1654
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,240
It's true that I had to
be that way as a kid.

1655
00:42:32,241 --> 00:42:33,750
I had to blend in when I moved.

1656
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,020
Moved here is very unique.

1657
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,870
I mean it's not like you're,

1658
00:42:37,871 --> 00:42:38,780
you're very unique,

1659
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,670
but I try to be,

1660
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:44,870
oh you should short bus unique
either your your unique dude.

1661
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,913
But yeah,

1662
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:49,460
you and I always wind up
with caveman conversations.

1663
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:53,840
I always go fucking right to though at
the bottom of a man's soul what we think

1664
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:57,260
about violence and sexuality and you know,

1665
00:42:57,261 --> 00:43:01,520
all this fucking societies and
illusion and when it crumbles down,

1666
00:43:01,521 --> 00:43:02,960
that fucking guy is going to fall apart.

1667
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,770
But that's what I hear.

1668
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:05,620
You and I have always had
this friendship where like,

1669
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:07,670
like where no matter what,

1670
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:08,720
if we're lying to each other,

1671
00:43:08,721 --> 00:43:09,480
like if we're just,

1672
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,170
we were like,

1673
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,540
we just don't want to deal
with the truth right now.

1674
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:12,770
We'll just start saying something like,

1675
00:43:12,771 --> 00:43:13,670
and like I would be like,

1676
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:14,421
I really love her.

1677
00:43:14,421 --> 00:43:15,254
And he'd be like,

1678
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:16,070
Hey,

1679
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,750
who are you fucking talking to now?

1680
00:43:17,751 --> 00:43:18,200
You down.

1681
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:18,441
I'm like,

1682
00:43:18,441 --> 00:43:19,250
but I live with her.

1683
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:19,820
Yeah.

1684
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:20,540
So what,

1685
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,640
you don't love her break
up with her immediately.

1686
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:22,940
You know,

1687
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,721
I could never get away.

1688
00:43:23,721 --> 00:43:25,820
We can never really get away
with like lying to each other.

1689
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:26,451
You know,

1690
00:43:26,451 --> 00:43:29,240
you were just too good of a friend to
have these crazy girls who were there.

1691
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,220
And when I say crazy girls put folks,

1692
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:35,510
I'm not an invasive sort of a a
friend when it comes to friends,

1693
00:43:35,511 --> 00:43:36,021
girlfriends,

1694
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:37,370
like Brian can tell you,

1695
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,840
I'm usually a pretty supportive,

1696
00:43:38,841 --> 00:43:40,130
right when you say Brian.

1697
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:40,881
Oh yeah,

1698
00:43:40,881 --> 00:43:41,331
absolutely.

1699
00:43:41,331 --> 00:43:41,791
And I did it.

1700
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:43,790
A lot of crazy girls and he
stayed a lot of crazy girls.

1701
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:47,540
But my fun but my take on it was
always just be sweet to them,

1702
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,470
be nice to him,

1703
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,940
fuck the shit out of them.

1704
00:43:49,941 --> 00:43:51,150
And if they leave they leave.

1705
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,160
You know that's how you go.

1706
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,090
But with you,

1707
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,390
you had a totally different kind of
crazy and developed an addiction.

1708
00:43:56,391 --> 00:44:00,320
You had a fascination with girls
who were gigantic problems.

1709
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:02,240
Brian's girls are sweet girls.

1710
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:03,230
They just,

1711
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,340
what happens in life?

1712
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,300
You'd take a left when you
should've taken a ride.

1713
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,071
You get stuck,

1714
00:44:07,071 --> 00:44:07,851
you can't pay your rent.

1715
00:44:07,851 --> 00:44:09,890
There's a lot of shit that
happens to people in life.

1716
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:14,030
So he's dealing with essentially
sweet girls that go down a bad track.

1717
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:18,380
Your dealing with fucking crazy people
all different ways you can lose your

1718
00:44:18,381 --> 00:44:19,070
fucking house.

1719
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:19,311
Oh,

1720
00:44:19,311 --> 00:44:20,270
not just lose your house,

1721
00:44:20,271 --> 00:44:20,580
your life,

1722
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,413
your life.

1723
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,220
You had,

1724
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:25,460
he had a few of 'em man where
he would bring over like it was,

1725
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,810
it was like Joe Lewis,

1726
00:44:26,811 --> 00:44:27,860
his bum of the month club,

1727
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:28,791
who's great,

1728
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,980
bring over all these new silly
bitches that he was dating.

1729
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,750
One of them I called bunch of naps.

1730
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,140
She came over,

1731
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:38,610
I met her cookies.

1732
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:38,851
Yeah,

1733
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:40,050
she comes over and I go there,

1734
00:44:40,051 --> 00:44:40,540
check,

1735
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,270
it looks like she needs a bunch of naps.

1736
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:42,871
Right.

1737
00:44:42,871 --> 00:44:45,270
And then 10 minutes into
hanging out at my house,

1738
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:45,751
Oh my God,

1739
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:46,561
I'm so tired.

1740
00:44:46,561 --> 00:44:50,610
She takes her shoes off and curls
up on the couch with a fucking cash.

1741
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,470
It was,

1742
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:52,111
I literally,

1743
00:44:52,111 --> 00:44:54,370
she was like having
owning a high tech patch.

1744
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:55,460
It was so strangling.

1745
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,340
She's my pet.

1746
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,510
It was so strange.

1747
00:44:57,511 --> 00:44:58,920
I have never met like,

1748
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,550
uh,

1749
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:00,440
more cat,

1750
00:45:00,441 --> 00:45:01,860
like human rights.

1751
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,580
I've never met a person who just like
had no desire to have an intelligent

1752
00:45:05,581 --> 00:45:06,271
conversation,

1753
00:45:06,271 --> 00:45:07,230
just wanted to take naps.

1754
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:09,390
I talked to this guy and this is fucking,

1755
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,600
I talked to is awesome dude
who's like a well known,

1756
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:13,190
um,

1757
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:13,960
like um,

1758
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,793
uh,

1759
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:15,711
like a,

1760
00:45:15,711 --> 00:45:16,630
a psychiatrist,

1761
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:17,371
got his PhD,

1762
00:45:17,371 --> 00:45:18,061
he's really smart guy.

1763
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:20,670
And he said a lot of times
people in relationships,

1764
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:23,430
like he works with a lot of like
couples and stuff like that.

1765
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,600
And then addicts and stuff.

1766
00:45:24,601 --> 00:45:25,080
He said,

1767
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:25,411
and he said,

1768
00:45:25,411 --> 00:45:30,411
a lot of times what human beings do
is we apply a construct on someone.

1769
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:31,861
So they'll,

1770
00:45:31,861 --> 00:45:35,300
you'll find somebody that looks the part
and then you just apply a construct.

1771
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:35,760
You just go,

1772
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,090
oh,

1773
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:36,960
that's who you are.

1774
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:37,823
You're this girl.

1775
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:39,030
You really like to work out.

1776
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:39,271
Yeah.

1777
00:45:39,271 --> 00:45:40,220
You're the j crew girl.

1778
00:45:40,221 --> 00:45:40,971
I'm on on,

1779
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:42,660
on a fucking on the front of a sail boat.

1780
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:43,800
That's what I want to date me.

1781
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:44,341
While the girl was like,

1782
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:45,570
I'm from fucking Michigan.

1783
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:47,250
I never been on a sailboat
in my fucking life.

1784
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:48,450
I like to do drugs every day.

1785
00:45:48,451 --> 00:45:49,284
What are you talking about?

1786
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:49,560
No,

1787
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,393
you know,

1788
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,910
why were you trying to construct the,

1789
00:45:53,911 --> 00:45:54,750
that sort of a,

1790
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:57,630
a really non realistic
reality though all the time?

1791
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,160
I don't know because it wasn't like,

1792
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,150
it was really strange.

1793
00:46:00,151 --> 00:46:03,360
It's like that's the kind of behavior
that you get from people that have a hard

1794
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:04,290
time meeting girls,

1795
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,330
but you had no problem.

1796
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,050
You can girls.

1797
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:07,861
It wasn't that at all.

1798
00:46:07,861 --> 00:46:08,880
You are not shy.

1799
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,370
You're always charming
and you're always funny.

1800
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:12,211
So I mean,

1801
00:46:12,211 --> 00:46:13,830
I can't remember a time where you're like,

1802
00:46:13,831 --> 00:46:14,221
dude,

1803
00:46:14,221 --> 00:46:15,750
I can't meet girls.

1804
00:46:15,751 --> 00:46:17,340
And just tired of being alone.

1805
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,450
It was never that.

1806
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:18,990
It was,

1807
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:19,621
it was you,

1808
00:46:19,621 --> 00:46:20,190
you know,

1809
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:22,890
for whatever reason would wind up getting,

1810
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,740
I can't crazy girl like this.

1811
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:25,710
There were so nuts,

1812
00:46:25,711 --> 00:46:25,981
dude,

1813
00:46:25,981 --> 00:46:27,780
that I was trying to figure out.

1814
00:46:27,781 --> 00:46:32,781
I spent many an hour by myself thinking
about you after many of our crazy

1815
00:46:34,471 --> 00:46:35,304
adventures,

1816
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:36,330
thinking about you going,

1817
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,250
how did this happen?

1818
00:46:38,251 --> 00:46:42,210
How did this guy get to this state of
mind where he lets this person in his life

1819
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,560
and then he can't see that.

1820
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:44,520
I don't understand that.

1821
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:45,960
This is what I'm hanging out with you.

1822
00:46:45,961 --> 00:46:46,440
I'm like,

1823
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,090
here's this insightful,

1824
00:46:48,091 --> 00:46:48,871
intelligent,

1825
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:53,871
objective self deprecating guy who's
really well read and yet he's hanging

1826
00:46:54,181 --> 00:46:55,900
around with legit methods.

1827
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,980
You were hanging around with like
scary people there were like,

1828
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,610
no,

1829
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:00,810
I really don't know what that was.

1830
00:47:00,811 --> 00:47:02,280
I think part of it was just,

1831
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:02,790
um,

1832
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:04,380
I think what it was was I'd go,

1833
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:04,591
oh,

1834
00:47:04,591 --> 00:47:07,020
that's a project and I
can save that person.

1835
00:47:07,021 --> 00:47:07,360
Yeah.

1836
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,400
I think that was a lot.

1837
00:47:08,401 --> 00:47:08,970
And that was,

1838
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:11,100
I found that very
intriguing where I'd say,

1839
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:11,731
you know what,

1840
00:47:11,731 --> 00:47:15,720
all you need is someone like me to change
your life and I know how to help you.

1841
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:19,260
And it took me a long time to realize
that that is the dumbest shit you can

1842
00:47:19,261 --> 00:47:20,094
advocate for it.

1843
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:23,040
Anybody dead fucking end.

1844
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,930
You never want to do that shit.

1845
00:47:24,931 --> 00:47:25,621
My goodness.

1846
00:47:25,621 --> 00:47:26,011
It is.

1847
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:26,161
You know,

1848
00:47:26,161 --> 00:47:28,950
you never want to do
that because you can't.

1849
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,321
You know,

1850
00:47:29,321 --> 00:47:30,010
my father said

1851
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,180
something interesting to me the other day.

1852
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:31,810
He said,

1853
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:32,230
look,

1854
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:33,580
you want to give advice to a kid.

1855
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,473
Very different.

1856
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:36,520
Don't ever get advice ever,

1857
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:37,121
ever.

1858
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:37,930
To An adult.

1859
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:39,430
Even if even if that can use it.

1860
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,413
I'm never doing,

1861
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:40,911
I should.

1862
00:47:40,911 --> 00:47:41,171
Yeah,

1863
00:47:41,171 --> 00:47:41,411
but I,

1864
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:41,951
the guys name,

1865
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:42,761
he's headed toward a wall.

1866
00:47:42,761 --> 00:47:43,031
He goes,

1867
00:47:43,031 --> 00:47:43,490
that's right.

1868
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:44,620
They know their head into a wall.

1869
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:45,401
Never.

1870
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:46,000
This is your dad.

1871
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,180
Yeah.

1872
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:46,501
And he said,

1873
00:47:46,501 --> 00:47:47,890
this isn't your dad do a talk show.

1874
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:51,350
I got to get him on my fuck because
one of my favorite people in the world,

1875
00:47:51,351 --> 00:47:52,690
he's the greatest because he lived here.

1876
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:53,563
He said,

1877
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:54,281
why don't you get it?

1878
00:47:54,281 --> 00:47:55,180
Can I go say,

1879
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,380
can I go on with your dad?

1880
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:56,651
Oh,

1881
00:47:56,651 --> 00:47:57,520
that'd be great.

1882
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:58,180
Please.

1883
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:58,361
Well,

1884
00:47:58,361 --> 00:48:00,760
he's a great guy to
talk to about politics,

1885
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:02,350
about the state of the fucking world.

1886
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:05,440
I would love about everything cause
he's been in a hundred countries.

1887
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,130
Oh Geez.

1888
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,830
He's going to Italy right now
just to brush up on his Italian.

1889
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:09,881
I'm like,

1890
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:10,391
why are you doing that?

1891
00:48:10,391 --> 00:48:10,750
He goes,

1892
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:11,290
I dunno,

1893
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:12,640
I'm going to Rome for three weeks.

1894
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,690
Wow.

1895
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,411
He was the greatest.

1896
00:48:14,411 --> 00:48:15,790
He said a sock and he was like,

1897
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,140
we were talking about like having a,

1898
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:19,960
you know when when you're with a woman
you want to be able to talk to her and

1899
00:48:19,961 --> 00:48:20,411
sometimes you can't.

1900
00:48:20,411 --> 00:48:21,244
He goes talk to her.

1901
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,331
What would you want to talk to her?

1902
00:48:22,331 --> 00:48:23,680
I've been married to
your mother for 50 years.

1903
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:25,250
I want to talk to her and I'm not gonna.

1904
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,030
It's ridiculous.

1905
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:26,650
It's got to work.

1906
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:28,760
Got To fucking work stupid.

1907
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:30,310
It was so great.

1908
00:48:30,311 --> 00:48:31,330
He's such a bottom,

1909
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:36,450
bottom line guy and and has read
everything but is also just a real man,

1910
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:38,500

1911
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:38,951
a real fun.

1912
00:48:38,951 --> 00:48:40,120
Sounds like a fun guy to talk to him.

1913
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,470
He's more of those,

1914
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:42,850
I call them every day when I need it.

1915
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:43,160
When I,

1916
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,250
when I want to talk about
something in the news or saw,

1917
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,093

1918
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,590
just get crazy with them.

1919
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,000
How deep do you go in the rabbit hole?

1920
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:50,050
As deep as it gets.

1921
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:50,381
Really,

1922
00:48:50,381 --> 00:48:53,050
you're that guy where you can go all
the way into the rabbit hole with him.

1923
00:48:53,051 --> 00:48:54,610
Like personal secrets.

1924
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:55,840
Fuck yes.

1925
00:48:55,841 --> 00:48:56,310
Anything.

00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:57,190
Oh fuck yes.

1927
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:57,380
And,

1928
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,140

1929
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:00,040

1963
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:26,230
I love this question because

1964
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:26,711
And he goes,

1965
00:49:26,711 --> 00:49:28,150
hey Ms. Guy doing nice to meet you.

1966
00:49:28,151 --> 00:49:28,720
Yay.

1967
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,770
And he just leaves.

1968
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:30,461
And My,

1969
00:49:30,461 --> 00:49:31,090
my father,

1970
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:31,923
my father goes,

1971
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,273
what's that got to do?

1972
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,270
And I go,

1973
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:34,381
oh,

1974
00:49:34,381 --> 00:49:34,690
he's,

1975
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:35,523
he's a writer.

1976
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:36,280
My father,

1977
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,113
oh,

1978
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,730
I suspect that's not
gonna work out for him.

1979
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,250
And I go and I go,

1980
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:43,990
how did you know that?

1981
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:44,830
And he goes,

1982
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:46,120
pattern recognition.

1983
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,560
I've been around,

1984
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:49,060
I'm 71 years old.

1985
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:51,970
That's how pattern rather
than Russian mission.

1986
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
So he's like that guy from the Bill
Ben Stiller movie where he has like the

1987
00:49:55,001 --> 00:49:56,270
human lie detector on it.

1988
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,390
That's what he can read
you in a heartbeat,

1989
00:49:58,391 --> 00:49:58,631
dude.

1990
00:49:58,631 --> 00:49:59,141
He can read,

1991
00:49:59,141 --> 00:50:00,340
you can see you walk across the street.

1992
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:01,450
He knows your whole fucking life.

1993
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:02,290
Then again,

1994
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,240
how the fuck are you so bad at that?

1995
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:05,080
Well,

1996
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,160
I'm actually good at it.

1997
00:50:06,161 --> 00:50:07,300
I choose to ignore it.

1998
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:07,960
Really?

1999
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,291
Yes,

2000
00:50:08,291 --> 00:50:09,310
I did actually.

2001
00:50:09,311 --> 00:50:10,720
I think I'm very good at it,

2002
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:13,450
but when I see a project I go,

2003
00:50:13,451 --> 00:50:14,284
hey,

2004
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:15,430
I need to help you.

2005
00:50:15,431 --> 00:50:16,900
So you almost,

2006
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:17,410
well,

2007
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:20,050
there was a self
destructive aspect to you.

2008
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:20,610
Uh,

2009
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:22,810
that always disturbed
me being your friend.

2010
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,910
That's what would drive me nuts,

2011
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:25,540
you know?

2012
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,990
And it was a distraction and it rocked.

2013
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,040
It hurt my career by the

2014
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,760
way.

2015
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,120
Really?

2016
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:29,570
Yeah,

2017
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:29,900
yeah,

2018
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,171
yeah.

2019
00:50:30,171 --> 00:50:33,980
It hurt my career and it
hurt my relationships with
people that were significant

2020
00:50:33,981 --> 00:50:35,030
in my life and yeah.

2021
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,230
Um,

2022
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:38,480
and I think a lot of that self sabotage,

2023
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:39,890
we all go through that stuff.

2024
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,820
You go through it,

2025
00:50:40,821 --> 00:50:41,121
man,

2026
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,560
you will weigh less than,

2027
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:43,191
than anybody.

2028
00:50:43,191 --> 00:50:47,150
I knew actually you were always very
good at cutting out the fat and I kept it

2029
00:50:47,151 --> 00:50:49,280
because I wanted an excuse maybe to,

2030
00:50:49,281 --> 00:50:49,780
uh,

2031
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,160
you know,

2032
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,230
I mean it was like a parachute.

2033
00:50:51,231 --> 00:50:52,064
You know what I mean?

2034
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:52,850
I think,

2035
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:53,683
um,

2036
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:58,850
there's very few reasons in life to give
yourself more problems and if you can

2037
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:02,030
find all your own
problems and address them,

2038
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:05,390
I try to deal with all your own
problems and be real honest about that.

2039
00:51:05,391 --> 00:51:08,630
Then it makes it really easy
to see other people's problems.

2040
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,250
But I've found that in my life when I
wasn't being honest with myself about my

2041
00:51:13,251 --> 00:51:14,180
own problems,

2042
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:15,620
when I had issues,

2043
00:51:15,621 --> 00:51:17,570
when I had unresolved things in my mind,

2044
00:51:17,571 --> 00:51:18,890
just when I was a real young man,

2045
00:51:18,891 --> 00:51:21,650
I was still growing up and trying
to get over my fucked up childhood.

2046
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:26,660
I found it much more difficult for me
to see problems and other people because

2047
00:51:26,661 --> 00:51:29,840
of the shield that I put on
recognizing my own issues.

2048
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:34,400
I wasn't as intuitive or insightful when
it came to recognizing other people.

2049
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:39,640
As I get older and I became as
honest as as humanly possible,

2050
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,020
which is how I am now,

2051
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:42,740
um,

2052
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:43,130
now,

2053
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:45,950
then it became where I
just see it everywhere.

2054
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,050
That became really obvious.

2055
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:51,980
That's what I have now become obsessed
with and that's why I don't suffer fools

2056
00:51:51,981 --> 00:51:52,311
anymore.

2057
00:51:52,311 --> 00:51:52,971
Like that's why,

2058
00:51:52,971 --> 00:51:53,660
because what I'm,

2059
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:55,970
what I'm very interested
in is figuring out,

2060
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,690
I want to stay as undiluted as I can
and as authentic when I was watching

2061
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:00,240
Springsteen,

2062
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:00,770
but I,

2063
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:03,260
the word that kept popping into
my head was just authentic.

2064
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,700
He's never lying.

2065
00:52:04,701 --> 00:52:05,630
It's everything about him,

2066
00:52:05,631 --> 00:52:06,441
the way he dresses,

2067
00:52:06,441 --> 00:52:09,230
the way everything about it
and nothing is in his way.

2068
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:12,860
There's no resistance is why he can do
a back bend and touch his head at 62.

2069
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:13,240
Why,

2070
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:13,431
why?

2071
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:16,520
You can literally back then he went
all the way back and hit his head.

2072
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:17,080
He can,

2073
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:17,913
he can run.

2074
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,860
He's 62.

2075
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:19,723
That's amazing.

2076
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:20,600
On stage,

2077
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,210
on stage,

2078
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:22,043
on Hollaback.

2079
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:22,993
At 62.

2080
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:24,290
And I went and I went,

2081
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,540
that guy is so out of his own way.

2082
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:27,081
You know,

2083
00:52:27,081 --> 00:52:27,891
I've said this before,

2084
00:52:27,891 --> 00:52:28,880
maybe on the podcast,

2085
00:52:28,881 --> 00:52:32,180
but it's one of my favorite metaphors
that Michelangelo said when he was Clark.

2086
00:52:32,181 --> 00:52:33,014
He said his name,

2087
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:33,810
I mean,

2088
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:34,090
when,

2089
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:34,923
when,

2090
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:35,331
sorry guys,

2091
00:52:35,331 --> 00:52:36,164
I speak a die.

2092
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:37,790
Uh,

2093
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:38,001
sorry.

2094
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:38,690
There are no girls here.

2095
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:39,523
Okay.

2096
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:40,131
Sorry.

2097
00:52:40,131 --> 00:52:40,550
Sorry.

2098
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:41,383
When Michelangelo,

2099
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:42,050
uh,

2100
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:42,440
said,

2101
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:42,650
uh,

2102
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:43,700
when he carved the David,

2103
00:52:43,701 --> 00:52:47,960
the statue of David and he had
this piece of marble and he said,

2104
00:52:47,961 --> 00:52:49,400
and this is a great metaphor for art,

2105
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:49,761
he said,

2106
00:52:49,761 --> 00:52:51,080
it's already in there.

2107
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:53,180
I just had to get all
the shit out of the way.

2108
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:53,991
And he said,

2109
00:52:53,991 --> 00:52:55,910
that's how you should look
at yourself as a human being.

2110
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:59,120
You're born and you acquire
a lot of shit as you're,

2111
00:52:59,121 --> 00:53:00,290
as you're growing up,

2112
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:00,651
right?

2113
00:53:00,651 --> 00:53:01,520
So as you grow up,

2114
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,810
a lot of Shit's put on you,

2115
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:04,760
but your family,

2116
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:05,270
uh,

2117
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:06,320
how they define you,

2118
00:53:06,321 --> 00:53:06,770
what they,

2119
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:07,730
what they do to you.

2120
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:08,210
Uh,

2121
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:08,931
PA school,

2122
00:53:08,931 --> 00:53:09,471
high school,

2123
00:53:09,471 --> 00:53:10,580
the trauma of school,

2124
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:11,960
the grief you go through,

2125
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:12,201
you know,

2126
00:53:12,201 --> 00:53:13,580
your body isn't what you wanted to do,

2127
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,980
those losses and stuff and
you put on a lot of stuff,

2128
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:16,470
you,

2129
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:16,700
you,

2130
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:21,320
you come to the world when you're ready
to take it on at 30 with a whole lot of

2131
00:53:21,321 --> 00:53:22,340
fucking baggage.

2132
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,020
And a lot of it's negative,

2133
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:24,990
you know?

2134
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:26,130
And the,

2135
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:31,310
the job then is to figure out a
way to get that stuff off you,

2136
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,950
to shed that stuff and get
back to who you really are,

2137
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,080
the authentic you.

2138
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:41,340
And that to me is at least as a comic
and as somebody who writes and stuff,

2139
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:41,671
that's,

2140
00:53:41,671 --> 00:53:43,140
that's all I think about now.

2141
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:43,741
You know,

2142
00:53:43,741 --> 00:53:44,551
what is,

2143
00:53:44,551 --> 00:53:47,460
what is how honest can I
truly be with my expression?

2144
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:50,460
Even if I'm being silly and like
talking about saving a whale,

2145
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:52,860
there's a lot of me in there that I'm,

2146
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:54,030
I'm talking about,

2147
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:54,630
you know,

2148
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:56,850
and especially now the stuff
that I'm working on now,

2149
00:53:56,851 --> 00:53:57,121
just,

2150
00:53:57,121 --> 00:53:57,870
you know,

2151
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:01,770
being a father and things like that and
that responsibility and what that really

2152
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:02,610
means and,

2153
00:54:02,611 --> 00:54:03,330
and,

2154
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:03,900
and uh,

2155
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,090
with my daughter and,

2156
00:54:05,091 --> 00:54:07,500
and not being able to
show us her a part of me,

2157
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:08,101
uh,

2158
00:54:08,101 --> 00:54:08,301
and,

2159
00:54:08,301 --> 00:54:08,821
and who,

2160
00:54:08,821 --> 00:54:09,451
who I want,

2161
00:54:09,451 --> 00:54:11,820
she's going to model them
and she dates after me.

2162
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:13,440
So I got to be a fucking,

2163
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,190
I got to be the,

2164
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:15,270
I got to be her hero.

2165
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,250
I got to be the guy that she actually,

2166
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:19,650
I don't want to Dayton
the guy I used to be,

2167
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:20,963
you know what I mean?

2168
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,660
So there's all those responsibilities
that you start taking on as you get older.

2169
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,400
But so much of that is,

2170
00:54:26,401 --> 00:54:28,320
and so much of fucking thought,

2171
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:28,751
you know,

2172
00:54:28,751 --> 00:54:29,500
but I've got to think,

2173
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,340
they act like it's an active process.

2174
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,760
Thinking and being creative is actually
learning what not to think about because

2175
00:54:38,251 --> 00:54:40,260
the rest of it comes to it.

2176
00:54:40,261 --> 00:54:41,041
There's the that that's a,

2177
00:54:41,041 --> 00:54:42,420
that's a real philosophy.

2178
00:54:42,421 --> 00:54:47,421
If you can open yourself up and think of
thinking as being more of a channel for

2179
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,100
what's available to you,

2180
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:52,650
that that's a very important distinction.

2181
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:54,420
This notion that they'd see,

2182
00:54:54,421 --> 00:54:55,231
a lot of people come and say,

2183
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,531
well,

2184
00:54:55,531 --> 00:54:56,670
I'm missing something.

2185
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:59,370
I'm missing something that
I have to add to my arsenal.

2186
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,270
No.

2187
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:00,781
In fact,

2188
00:55:00,781 --> 00:55:02,020
what you're probably doing is there's,

2189
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,550
there's something you've got to let
go of and when you let go of that,

2190
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,700
you'll get what you're looking for
or you'll find that that that's a,

2191
00:55:08,701 --> 00:55:11,140
that's a fundamental difference
in thinking about things.

2192
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,450
And I think a lot of times we're taught,

2193
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:13,403
hey,

2194
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:13,861
you,

2195
00:55:13,861 --> 00:55:14,880
you're missing something.

2196
00:55:14,881 --> 00:55:16,080
You got to add to your,

2197
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:16,500
your,

2198
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,300
you got to put another
Arrow in your quiver.

2199
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:19,441
In fact,

2200
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,221
you might have the,

2201
00:55:20,221 --> 00:55:20,391
the,

2202
00:55:20,391 --> 00:55:21,224
the uh,

2203
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:21,660
better,

2204
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,820
better advice may may be to say,

2205
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,470
you got to let some stuff go,

2206
00:55:25,471 --> 00:55:25,890
man.

2207
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:27,180
You're holding on to some stuff.

2208
00:55:27,181 --> 00:55:28,290
You've got to let some stuff go.

2209
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,800
You're still defining yourself along
lines that are not helpful to you.

2210
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:32,790
You're still,

2211
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:35,790
you still have people in your life that
are not your friends even though they

2212
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:36,690
seem like they are,

2213
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:37,950
you still have,

2214
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:43,340
you're still doing a job that you hate
because it's an excuse to not do not go

2215
00:55:44,191 --> 00:55:45,150
for what you really want.

2216
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,890
There are a lot of things
that you should be deleting.

2217
00:55:46,891 --> 00:55:49,020
You should be taking out of your life and,

2218
00:55:49,021 --> 00:55:49,401
and,

2219
00:55:49,401 --> 00:55:53,460
and then there will be room for
something that's much better.

2220
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:54,061
That's a,

2221
00:55:54,061 --> 00:55:54,841
that's a very,

2222
00:55:54,841 --> 00:55:58,410
it's a scary way to think of it but I
don't think we talk about that enough.

2223
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:02,420
I don't think that that is something
that is a given enough voice to

2224
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:05,570
definitely something when I get
older I feel myself doing that.

2225
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:10,540
Just like deleting shit out of your
life that day constantly bugs you in HR.

2226
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:12,560
Like if it's people or friends or,

2227
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,470
I mean that's one of the biggest things
I've been running into lately is just

2228
00:56:15,471 --> 00:56:18,330
like how many people
that that I keep in like,

2229
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:19,161
like almost a book.

2230
00:56:19,161 --> 00:56:19,461
Like Hey,

2231
00:56:19,461 --> 00:56:20,271
this person's my friend,

2232
00:56:20,271 --> 00:56:21,081
this person was my friend.

2233
00:56:21,081 --> 00:56:22,280
But then actually going through it,

2234
00:56:22,281 --> 00:56:22,461
I'm like,

2235
00:56:22,461 --> 00:56:24,130
why am I friends with this person?

2236
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:24,370
Yeah.

2237
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:27,160
There's a million other people that want
to be my friend that I could just start

2238
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,640
hanging out with that could just take
this place and this person's positive,

2239
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:31,240
you know?

2240
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:31,490
Yeah.

2241
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:33,340
We'll watch when people go into a room,

2242
00:56:33,341 --> 00:56:36,280
like a lot of times my mother will go
into a room and find everything that's

2243
00:56:36,281 --> 00:56:37,390
dangerous in a room.

2244
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,590
She'll look at the world and try to chew.

2245
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:41,660
She can see a whole bunch of
things that are dangerous.

2246
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:42,790
How many times you wash people,

2247
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:43,660
talk to their kids and say,

2248
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:45,460
be careful my break your arm.

2249
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:46,541
Careful of that.

2250
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:47,100
Don't do that.

2251
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,450
You're always putting
restrictions on people.

2252
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,580
Now you've got to do that
to an extent with children,

2253
00:56:51,581 --> 00:56:52,390
of course.

2254
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:54,460
But we grow up with that,

2255
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:55,653
with that,

2256
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,273
um,

2257
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,960
that kind of guidance.

2258
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:01,270
And a lot of times they mean well,

2259
00:57:01,271 --> 00:57:02,380
but it's the wrong guidance.

2260
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:03,490
It's getting in your way,

2261
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,533
you know?

2262
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:04,931
Yeah,

2263
00:57:04,931 --> 00:57:05,650
for sure.

2264
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:10,210
There's definitely patterns that people
can sit down early in their life and

2265
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:14,950
then continue to follow those patterns
and have them not be productive at all.

2266
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:18,880
It's a real dangerous thing about human
beings is that we operate in patterns

2267
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,340
and once a pattern has been established,

2268
00:57:21,341 --> 00:57:22,960
even if it's completely ridiculous,

2269
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,033
we'll follow it.

2270
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:28,090
Whether it's circumcision or whether it's
cutting holes and your lip to stretch

2271
00:57:28,091 --> 00:57:28,361
it out,

2272
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,860
to put them fucking plate in it.

2273
00:57:29,861 --> 00:57:31,970
Like those crazy women answering the,

2274
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:32,741
why do they do that?

2275
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:32,861
Well,

2276
00:57:32,861 --> 00:57:32,991
they,

2277
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,980
because the pattern has been established
and they just fall right into it and it

2278
00:57:35,981 --> 00:57:37,150
can get real weird man.

2279
00:57:37,151 --> 00:57:37,600
It can.

2280
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,490
There can be patterns for cannibalism.

2281
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,700
The semen ingesting tribes of New Guinea.

2282
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:43,560
Do you know about all that?

2283
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:43,930
Yep.

2284
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:45,550
How fucking nutty is that?

2285
00:57:45,551 --> 00:57:47,830
If you don't know the story behind that,

2286
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:51,710
just look up seamen
tribe's new Guinea and I,

2287
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:56,380
there's no way we could delve into
hell fucking unbelievably bizarre and

2288
00:57:56,381 --> 00:57:56,890
twisted.

2289
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:57,161
It is,

2290
00:57:57,161 --> 00:57:59,260
but there's a whole
tribe and not just one,

2291
00:57:59,261 --> 00:58:03,720
but hundreds of them that
live in New Guinea that they,

2292
00:58:03,721 --> 00:58:05,890
they're feeding kids sperm.

2293
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:06,700
They're in jail.

2294
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:09,430
They're making them suck their dicks and
they're fucking them in the ass to make

2295
00:58:09,431 --> 00:58:11,050
these kids grow older.

2296
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:14,290
And they even in fact believe some of
them believe that the only way that a

2297
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:18,490
child develops semen is it has to be
planted in his body by fucking them in the

2298
00:58:18,491 --> 00:58:19,324
ass.

2299
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:20,230
Wow.

2300
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,063
Yeah.

2301
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:21,401
I mean,

2302
00:58:21,401 --> 00:58:24,550
how did that pattern get gold street
history's riddled with those kinds of

2303
00:58:24,551 --> 00:58:25,211
crazy,

2304
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:25,451
you know,

2305
00:58:25,451 --> 00:58:25,751
I mean,

2306
00:58:25,751 --> 00:58:27,610
Charles Taylor and one of the,

2307
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:30,610
one of the slogans I just
was listening to NPR,

2308
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:33,370
Charles Taylor was the president
of Liberia and there was,

2309
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:34,510
I mean,

2310
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:35,021
Charles Taylor,

2311
00:58:35,021 --> 00:58:35,711
when he came to power,

2312
00:58:35,711 --> 00:58:36,061
he took,

2313
00:58:36,061 --> 00:58:36,400
uh,

2314
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,090
what's his name?

2315
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:37,480
Uh,

2316
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:37,931
go.

2317
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:38,621
They made him eat the,

2318
00:58:38,621 --> 00:58:40,540
made the guy eat his own
ears and they videotaped it.

2319
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:41,000
Right?

2320
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:41,300
That's,

2321
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:41,500
yeah.

2322
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,101
Then they killed him.

2323
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:42,301
They,

2324
00:58:42,301 --> 00:58:42,501
they,

2325
00:58:42,501 --> 00:58:42,680
they,

2326
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:42,880
they,

2327
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,241
when they,

2328
00:58:43,241 --> 00:58:44,680
when he overthrew that government,

2329
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:45,280
uh,

2330
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,480
Samuel Doe,

2331
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,530
who was the price,

2332
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:50,380
I believe the current
president of Liberia,

2333
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:53,230
he and his henchmen and Charles
Taylor was at military guy,

2334
00:58:53,231 --> 00:58:55,180
I think a major in the army or a general,

2335
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:59,650
and they had them on a plane and
they staged the COO out on the plane.

2336
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:00,940
And before they killed him,

2337
00:59:00,941 --> 00:59:01,990
they made him meet his own ears.

2338
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:02,883
Wow.

2339
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,050
They made him on pain,

2340
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:04,630
rock Johnson.

2341
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:07,000
He was a bad guy and
they made a meat eaters,

2342
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:07,301
one of yours.

2343
00:59:07,301 --> 00:59:08,470
And I think another part of his body.

2344
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:09,161
And then they,

2345
00:59:09,161 --> 00:59:09,490
uh,

2346
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:10,630
and then I think they actually,

2347
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:12,190
then they castrated
and let them bleed out.

2348
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,050
Oh Geez.

2349
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,600
Point is that he was a
ruthless guy and he's,

2350
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:19,660
he's the one who said Foday Sankoh who
had an Iberia and bleed out on a plane.

2351
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:20,770
Yes.

2352
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:22,180
What puddle that must've been,

2353
00:59:22,181 --> 00:59:22,440
yeah.

2354
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,900
I don't know all the details,

2355
00:59:23,901 --> 00:59:25,880
but it was a very brutal
way of coming to power.

2356
00:59:25,881 --> 00:59:27,400
And Charles Taylor was
associate about just,

2357
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:28,970
just convicted in the Hague by the way,

2358
00:59:28,971 --> 00:59:31,250
just convicted for war crimes
and crimes against humanity.

2359
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:32,920
But he was the one that said the flood,

2360
00:59:32,921 --> 00:59:34,190
they Sanko who is the,

2361
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:36,500
the warlord and Sierra Leone.

2362
00:59:36,501 --> 00:59:36,771
He said,

2363
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:40,340
you have to brutalize the people so badly
that they have no other choice but to

2364
00:59:40,341 --> 00:59:43,790
vote you in because they're so there
too afraid not to vote for you.

2365
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:44,631
And that was,

2366
00:59:44,631 --> 00:59:45,590
that was funny sample.

2367
00:59:45,591 --> 00:59:47,030
We used to go from town to town and said,

2368
00:59:47,031 --> 00:59:47,631
if you voted,

2369
00:59:47,631 --> 00:59:48,950
if you voted for the government,

2370
00:59:48,951 --> 00:59:51,650
and currently we're going to cut all
your hands off and he'd cut everybody's

2371
00:59:51,651 --> 00:59:52,130
hands off.

2372
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:52,711
Oh my God.

2373
00:59:52,711 --> 00:59:53,810
I Scott and,

2374
00:59:53,811 --> 00:59:54,261
and what,

2375
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:55,430
what Charles Taylor,

2376
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:56,900
Charles Taylor said,

2377
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,140
one of the slogans when he
was running for president was,

2378
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:01,550
you killed my mother.

2379
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:02,570
You killed my father,

2380
01:00:02,571 --> 01:00:03,890
but I'm still gonna vote for you.

2381
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:04,933
And it worked for him.

2382
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:06,260
It worked for them.

2383
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:07,370
That's how insane.

2384
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:12,640
That's how insane a mind indoctrination
can become if somebody is vicious enough

2385
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:15,860
to do it or manipulate it enough.

2386
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:16,500
There was an,

2387
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:16,730
uh,

2388
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:19,700
an ancient Japanese story
that Dunkin told me about,

2389
01:00:19,701 --> 01:00:20,050
uh,

2390
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:20,340
uh,

2391
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:22,370
a king or an emperor who,

2392
01:00:22,371 --> 01:00:23,204
uh,

2393
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:26,030
hired someone to keep
his concubines in line.

2394
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:27,530
He hired a,

2395
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:28,041
this,

2396
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:28,281
a,

2397
01:00:28,281 --> 01:00:31,610
this famous military adviser to
keep this concubines in line.

2398
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:33,370
Concubine is a prosperous today.

2399
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:34,520
So he said,

2400
01:00:34,521 --> 01:00:35,354
if you can,

2401
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:37,490
if you could keep my concubines in line,

2402
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,290
then surely you could run my army.

2403
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:40,260
So,

2404
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:40,640
hmm.

2405
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,280
What the guy did as he
stepped up and he said,

2406
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:44,630
uh,

2407
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:46,040
he clapped his hands and he said,

2408
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:46,874
listen to me,

2409
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:49,040
I'm going to say move to the left.

2410
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:50,390
And you move to the left.

2411
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:51,350
Ready?

2412
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:52,190
And he claps his hands.

2413
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:53,810
They moved to the left,

2414
01:00:53,811 --> 01:00:55,130
but a couple of them moved to the right.

2415
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,080
And some of them don't do anything.

2416
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:58,191
So he says it,

2417
01:00:58,191 --> 01:00:59,450
I'm going to say it one more time.

2418
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:00,980
I'm going to clap my hands.

2419
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:02,320
And when I say move to the left,

2420
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,590
you all move to the left.

2421
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:04,760
So it does it again.

2422
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:05,480
And again.

2423
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,920
Half of them don't pay attention.

2424
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:11,120
So he takes the emperors
favorite concubine.

2425
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:15,530
He brings her in front of everyone
and he cuts her fucking head off Jesus

2426
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:15,531
Christ.

2427
01:01:15,531 --> 01:01:16,880
And the emperor tries to stop him.

2428
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:18,680
The emperor runs in and he goes,

2429
01:01:18,681 --> 01:01:18,921
no,

2430
01:01:18,921 --> 01:01:19,161
no,

2431
01:01:19,161 --> 01:01:19,611
not her,

2432
01:01:19,611 --> 01:01:20,001
not her.

2433
01:01:20,001 --> 01:01:20,751
She's my favorite.

2434
01:01:20,751 --> 01:01:20,991
He goes,

2435
01:01:20,991 --> 01:01:21,500
no.

2436
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:21,981
He goes,

2437
01:01:21,981 --> 01:01:25,790
you cannot win a war if you're not
willing to do what must be done.

2438
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:26,691
And he goes,

2439
01:01:26,691 --> 01:01:27,650
this is what must be done.

2440
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:29,990
Cods her fucking head off and everybody,

2441
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:31,370
and then he claps his hands and he said,

2442
01:01:31,371 --> 01:01:32,510
when I say move to the left,

2443
01:01:32,511 --> 01:01:36,740
you move to the labs and they fucking
fell in line and everyone fell in love.

2444
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:38,330
They knew that that was his favorite one.

2445
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,850
That's why he took the favorite
one and cut her head off.

2446
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:43,910
Because there's certain things you
have to do if you want to run shit.

2447
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:44,300
Right.

2448
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:44,991
And that's one.

2449
01:01:44,991 --> 01:01:45,500
And this is a,

2450
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,070
that was,

2451
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:46,340
you know,

2452
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:48,710
a true military move.

2453
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:49,131
Well,

2454
01:01:49,131 --> 01:01:50,870
what's interesting about that's how,

2455
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:53,480
that's how every society was ruled,

2456
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:54,890
especially with the Romans.

2457
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,900
The Romans basically in this book,

2458
01:01:56,901 --> 01:01:57,531
extreme fear.

2459
01:01:57,531 --> 01:02:01,730
The Romans literally just train
their army and constant warfare.

2460
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:03,650
Their training was constant and they kept,

2461
01:02:03,651 --> 01:02:04,011
and they,

2462
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:06,650
and their battles were as simulated.

2463
01:02:06,651 --> 01:02:06,771
Their,

2464
01:02:06,771 --> 01:02:09,360
their training was as close to
reality as they could simulate.

2465
01:02:09,361 --> 01:02:11,000
And they were a very hard group.

2466
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:12,920
One of the reasons being when you want it,

2467
01:02:12,921 --> 01:02:13,191
if you,

2468
01:02:13,191 --> 01:02:14,570
if you want to be ready for combat,

2469
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:15,201
you know,

2470
01:02:15,201 --> 01:02:16,070
you know this from MMA,

2471
01:02:16,071 --> 01:02:16,221
you,

2472
01:02:16,221 --> 01:02:16,911
you better be,

2473
01:02:16,911 --> 01:02:18,650
you better be training like in,

2474
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:20,550
in that mimic

2475
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:22,160
combat as close as you can.

2476
01:02:22,161 --> 01:02:22,994
And we all know this but,

2477
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:23,701
but,

2478
01:02:23,701 --> 01:02:23,821
uh,

2479
01:02:23,821 --> 01:02:27,000
one of the things that's interesting
about that way of ruling,

2480
01:02:27,001 --> 01:02:30,180
which was always by the
sword and extreme measures,

2481
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:35,480
was that the political experiment that
happened in this country 250 years ago in

2482
01:02:35,641 --> 01:02:36,474
Philadelphia,

2483
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,900
the drafting of the federalist papers
and the constitution was in fact

2484
01:02:39,901 --> 01:02:41,430
completely the opposite.

2485
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:42,331
It was,

2486
01:02:42,331 --> 01:02:43,710
it was the notion that,

2487
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:44,850
that in fact,

2488
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:45,840
um,

2489
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,520
you as a ruler,

2490
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:48,000
where we're,

2491
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:48,510
we're,

2492
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:52,770
we're the servant of and for the people.

2493
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,710
And that was what was
such a radical notion,

2494
01:02:55,711 --> 01:02:58,350
this idea that there was not going
to be a king and all powerful king.

2495
01:02:58,351 --> 01:02:59,820
It's why when George Washington and said,

2496
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,650
I don't want to be king,

2497
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,240
I am not a king.

2498
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:04,980
We are not going to have
a king in this country.

2499
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:09,570
We're going to have a president who's
voted in by the people at that time.

2500
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:10,120
It was,

2501
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:10,620
you know,

2502
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,790
white landowning people.

2503
01:03:11,791 --> 01:03:13,350
But it was still a radical notion.

2504
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,180
It started it,

2505
01:03:15,181 --> 01:03:17,790
the kernels of that began in,

2506
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:18,220
in,

2507
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:19,590
in England where the,

2508
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,270
the,

2509
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:22,170
the king actually had to start being,

2510
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:22,830
uh,

2511
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:24,420
listening to the parliament.

2512
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:29,600
But it was such a radical notion that
you had a group of people that were not

2513
01:03:30,871 --> 01:03:31,710
military,

2514
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:33,960
that didn't have guns yet.

2515
01:03:33,961 --> 01:03:34,440
They had,

2516
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,790
they had the authority,

2517
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:36,450
um,

2518
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:36,830
and the,

2519
01:03:36,830 --> 01:03:38,920
the balancing power of the authority to,

2520
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:39,960
to make laws,

2521
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:41,160
to raise taxes,

2522
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:42,150
to pass taxes.

2523
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:47,151
But they were ultimately at the behest
of the population they were serving,

2524
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,620
never been done before.

2525
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:51,630
And what it gave rise to is the strongest,

2526
01:03:51,631 --> 01:03:53,670
most innovative country in the world.

2527
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:54,870
In a lot of ways.

2528
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:57,680
If you talk to political philosophy,

2529
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:58,021
you know,

2530
01:03:58,021 --> 01:03:58,591
people who are,

2531
01:03:58,591 --> 01:03:59,010
who are,

2532
01:03:59,010 --> 01:03:59,190
uh,

2533
01:03:59,190 --> 01:03:59,910
political,

2534
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:00,690
you know,

2535
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:01,523
um,

2536
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,393
uh,

2537
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,330
um,

2538
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:05,950
people who make politics life that,

2539
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:08,340
that experiments solve
the political problem,

2540
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:10,140
they solve the political problem.

2541
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:12,540
No one ever argues about the,

2542
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:15,000
the fallibility of the constitution.

2543
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:17,760
It's always a question
of how you interpret it.

2544
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,400
But we always stay within the
confines of the Constitution,

2545
01:04:20,401 --> 01:04:21,720
which is kind of amazing.

2546
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:23,910
And it's such a radical difference.

2547
01:04:23,911 --> 01:04:25,740
Like that is how you control people.

2548
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:26,970
It is how you control people.

2549
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,020
Look at Russia.

2550
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:33,350
Russia's run by a group of ex KGB
guys who are all military guys there.

2551
01:04:33,841 --> 01:04:34,591
One resources,

2552
01:04:34,591 --> 01:04:34,891
oil,

2553
01:04:34,891 --> 01:04:35,820
they have a lot of money.

2554
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:39,150
When was the last time you saw
anything come out of Russia?

2555
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:40,320
Like a car,

2556
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,720
like a computer or even clothing.

2557
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:45,600
What innovation has
ever come out of Russia?

2558
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:47,220
Nothing but minerals.

2559
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,210
Nothing but oil.

2560
01:04:48,211 --> 01:04:49,044
You know why?

2561
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:51,420
Because that kind of thinking,

2562
01:04:51,421 --> 01:04:54,120
that kind of brutality that
kind of might makes right.

2563
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:57,690
Actually at the end of the
day makes a country weaker.

2564
01:04:58,170 --> 01:04:59,460
We'll do it just to make it stronger.

2565
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:01,200
They were so good with,

2566
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:01,710
uh,

2567
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:02,970
with rocketry though.

2568
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,640
They were amazing.

2569
01:05:04,641 --> 01:05:05,474
They were amazing.

2570
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:06,660
They were innovative.

2571
01:05:06,661 --> 01:05:07,100
They were,

2572
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:07,380
yes.

2573
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:08,640
When it came to the space race,

2574
01:05:08,641 --> 01:05:09,810
it's really incredible.

2575
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:10,051
Oh,

2576
01:05:10,051 --> 01:05:10,890
you mean the Soviets,

2577
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:11,873
Soviets and it's,

2578
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,720
it's fascinating.

2579
01:05:12,721 --> 01:05:17,530
It's also how their designs were parallel
to like what Wernher von Braun was

2580
01:05:17,531 --> 01:05:17,750
doing,

2581
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:18,190
but yet

2582
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:21,040
different like different sorts
of setups with the rockets.

2583
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:23,230
And they had a little bit
of a different thing though.

2584
01:05:23,231 --> 01:05:28,231
The Soviets were first of all had a very
rich tradition of art and literature

2585
01:05:28,961 --> 01:05:29,830
and culture.

2586
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:31,210
And they also,

2587
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:32,020
you know,

2588
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:33,340
back in the day,

2589
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:35,280
communism for a lot of Soviets,

2590
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:37,120
a lot of Russians was an ideal.

2591
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:38,710
An idealistic was,

2592
01:05:38,711 --> 01:05:40,540
it was an ideology they
really believed in.

2593
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:42,550
And so there was a,

2594
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:43,481
for a long time,

2595
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:44,530
a real communal effort.

2596
01:05:44,531 --> 01:05:48,400
There was this notion that we as a country
are not only doing the right thing,

2597
01:05:48,401 --> 01:05:50,020
but we're going to beat the American,

2598
01:05:50,021 --> 01:05:51,850
the imperialists at their own game.

2599
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:52,031
Well,

2600
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:52,450
they would,

2601
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:56,590
I was going to say as they really are
very innovative when it came to a certain

2602
01:05:56,591 --> 01:05:57,680
aspects of technology.

2603
01:05:58,030 --> 01:05:58,930
Mike Swick,

2604
01:05:59,020 --> 01:05:59,291
uh,

2605
01:05:59,291 --> 01:06:00,010
you know Mike,

2606
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:01,870
the guy a out of San Jose,

2607
01:06:01,871 --> 01:06:03,160
the fighter UFC guy,

2608
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:04,293
really good dude,

2609
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:04,750
um,

2610
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:09,580
was working in a u s embassy
in Russia a long time ago.

2611
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:14,050
And he said they found like they would
find like little hearing devices and shit

2612
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,030
that the Russians had put into their,

2613
01:06:16,031 --> 01:06:19,240
their stuff to look at them
and to listen in on them.

2614
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:23,950
And one of them they found was powered
by the swaying of the building.

2615
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:25,600
They had never seen anything like it.

2616
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:26,471
You know what though?

2617
01:06:26,471 --> 01:06:29,850
Had to like back engineer this fucking
thing and go like if you look at it

2618
01:06:29,851 --> 01:06:30,070
though,

2619
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:34,270
the Cold War on what one the war was
the fact that the Soviets ultimately,

2620
01:06:34,271 --> 01:06:36,250
actually from a
technological point of view,

2621
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,120
first of all they stole,

2622
01:06:37,121 --> 01:06:42,121
remember they stole from the Rosenbergs
was that the guys that were put to death

2623
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:43,510
by I believe Truman,

2624
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:44,360
um,

2625
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:44,790
the,

2626
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:46,990
the couple that sold the Soviets,

2627
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:51,430
the weapon that the technology
for the nuclear weapon and really,

2628
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:51,830
yes.

2629
01:06:51,830 --> 01:06:52,540
So Soviet system,

2630
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:53,141
he's got there,

2631
01:06:53,141 --> 01:06:53,600
got there,

2632
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,071
got the,

2633
01:06:54,071 --> 01:06:55,180
got the bomb from us.

2634
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:56,320
They have through espionage.

2635
01:06:56,321 --> 01:06:57,670
But having said that,

2636
01:06:57,671 --> 01:07:01,960
I read some sh what did I read something
about that being a bad decision.

2637
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:03,050
Well,

2638
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:04,090
what about the fact that,

2639
01:07:04,091 --> 01:07:04,640
that we uh,

2640
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:05,860
Truman put them both to death.

2641
01:07:05,861 --> 01:07:06,031
The,

2642
01:07:06,031 --> 01:07:06,311
the,

2643
01:07:06,311 --> 01:07:06,581
the,

2644
01:07:06,581 --> 01:07:07,040
what the hell?

2645
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,360
I can't believe I'm rose acres.

2646
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:09,640
I can't believe I'm
blanking on their name.

2647
01:07:09,641 --> 01:07:10,300
Your ex flex.

2648
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:11,140
It's that it's the Rosen.

2649
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:11,591
It's the,

2650
01:07:11,591 --> 01:07:12,010
um,

2651
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:12,810
I can't believe I'm,

2652
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:14,470
it's Roseburg or road Rosenberg.

2653
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:15,750
It was a,

2654
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:17,710
it was a couple that sold the Soviets,

2655
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:18,520
the secrets,

2656
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,510
the secret to the bomb.

2657
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:24,070
And then that started the
arms race and Ethel Rosenberg.

2658
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:24,521
Yes,

2659
01:07:24,521 --> 01:07:25,240
thank you.

2660
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:29,050
And they were put to death for selling
the soviets and the Soviets got a lot of

2661
01:07:29,051 --> 01:07:31,810
their technology not from
within their own sort of,

2662
01:07:31,811 --> 01:07:32,230
you know,

2663
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:34,180
their own laboratories but from other lab,

2664
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:35,081
other places.

2665
01:07:35,081 --> 01:07:35,351
And then,

2666
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:35,561
you know,

2667
01:07:35,561 --> 01:07:36,040
worked on it.

2668
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,080
But one of the things
that the Soviets lost,

2669
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:39,251
like for example,

2670
01:07:39,251 --> 01:07:42,130
their Mig fighter jets
couldn't fly as hire as fast.

2671
01:07:42,131 --> 01:07:42,311
You know,

2672
01:07:42,311 --> 01:07:44,920
why they couldn't come up
with the kind of steel,

2673
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,570
when you deal with pro fighter jets,

2674
01:07:46,571 --> 01:07:47,830
it's all about like how,

2675
01:07:47,831 --> 01:07:48,131
how,

2676
01:07:48,131 --> 01:07:51,010
what kind of temperature resistance
steel you can come up with.

2677
01:07:51,011 --> 01:07:55,870
That way you can burn hotter and our
RF fourteens and efficacy sixteens at

2678
01:07:55,871 --> 01:08:00,871
fifteens or whatever could burn fuel
at a much higher temperature without

2679
01:08:01,121 --> 01:08:03,340
melting the metal so we
could fly higher and faster.

2680
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:04,840
They couldn't keep up with us.

2681
01:08:04,841 --> 01:08:06,940
But you heard about this
new thing that went,

2682
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:07,931
what is it?

2683
01:08:07,931 --> 01:08:10,540
180 times faster than the speed of sound?

2684
01:08:10,541 --> 01:08:10,841
Brian,

2685
01:08:10,841 --> 01:08:11,930
what was this new uh,

2686
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:13,120
experimental craft?

2687
01:08:13,121 --> 01:08:13,780
If they had,

2688
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:15,770
I didn't hear you didn't
hear about this on Twitter?

2689
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:16,190
No,

2690
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:16,750
dude.

2691
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:16,920
What?

2692
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:20,540
Somebody who's NASA spacecraft
that they've developed it for?

2693
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:21,650
It's a drone right now,

2694
01:08:21,651 --> 01:08:25,760
but it went 100,000 some
insane miles per hour limit.

2695
01:08:25,761 --> 01:08:26,030
Let me,

2696
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:27,410
let me give you the exact,

2697
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:29,690
that this is what race has
all kinds of questions.

2698
01:08:29,691 --> 01:08:30,830
Did you see that Cheetah,

2699
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,220
that fucking mechanical Cheetah
that they're going to put guns on?

2700
01:08:34,221 --> 01:08:38,390
It runs like a Cheetah
and one's like robotics.

2701
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:39,360
The Darpa robots,

2702
01:08:39,870 --> 01:08:40,580
transformers,

2703
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:40,810
dude,

2704
01:08:40,810 --> 01:08:41,840
robotics are,

2705
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:42,240
are,

2706
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,900
we're going to have like
all kinds of crazy shit.

2707
01:08:44,901 --> 01:08:46,070
It raises a lot of questions,

2708
01:08:46,071 --> 01:08:46,760
man.

2709
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:47,593
I Dunno.

2710
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:48,660
Yeah.

2711
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:49,440
In other words,

2712
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:50,690
we get that good at killing.

2713
01:08:50,691 --> 01:08:51,321
What does that mean?

2714
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:51,980
Right.

2715
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:52,813
So that drone,

2716
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:55,340
that would be pretty
much as fast as a bullet.

2717
01:08:55,341 --> 01:08:59,960
What this fucking thing apparently went
so fast that it peeled the skin off of

2718
01:08:59,961 --> 01:09:00,240
it.

2719
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,300
What they,

2720
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:02,810
they,

2721
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:05,860
they anticipated that the speed
was going to peel some of it off,

2722
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:07,610
but apparently appealed all of it off.

2723
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:12,010
Peel skin yet another and yet
another device where we're,

2724
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:13,550
we're not going to need soldiers anymore.

2725
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:13,970
I might,

2726
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:15,470
that's my joke where I go to the war here,

2727
01:09:15,471 --> 01:09:17,930
I was going to in 20 years is going
to be the Chubby dude with huge thumb

2728
01:09:17,931 --> 01:09:18,500
muscles.

2729
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:19,640
Smells like Doritos and we'd,

2730
01:09:19,641 --> 01:09:20,060
cause he's,

2731
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:21,350
he's working toggle switches.

2732
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,193
Yeah,

2733
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:22,660
we were,

2734
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:23,000
you know,

2735
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,120
you think about how good guys get at
video games where it's so frustrating to

2736
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:26,511
play though.

2737
01:09:26,511 --> 01:09:29,660
Imagine if those guys are in control of
like some sort of a death machine with

2738
01:09:29,661 --> 01:09:30,540
no lag time.

2739
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:31,580
So that means Korea wins,

2740
01:09:31,581 --> 01:09:32,190
right?

2741
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:34,580
A hypersonic glider.

2742
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:39,850
And then what they're saying is the skin
was peeled off by this speed of this

2743
01:09:40,881 --> 01:09:41,714
fucking thing.

2744
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:43,191
This is a,

2745
01:09:43,191 --> 01:09:44,300
this is incredible.

2746
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:45,830
This is another Darpa project,

2747
01:09:45,831 --> 01:09:46,311
Darpa there.

2748
01:09:46,311 --> 01:09:48,950
So you video games are responsible thing.

2749
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,040
Video Games were responsible
for top gun fighter pilots and,

2750
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:53,330
and for Swat team guys,

2751
01:09:53,331 --> 01:09:56,630
he'd get these 16 year olds to come in
and they can fly a plane after learning a

2752
01:09:56,631 --> 01:10:00,320
little bit on the simulator as well as
any top gun fighter pilot or shoot more

2753
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:01,940
accurately than the best sniper.

2754
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:02,151
You know,

2755
01:10:02,151 --> 01:10:05,800
why they'd been playing fucking gun
video games and fighter pilots shit since

2756
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:06,650
they were three years old.

2757
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:07,611
So they just,

2758
01:10:07,611 --> 01:10:09,110
they had that hand eye coordination.

2759
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:09,461
Yeah,

2760
01:10:09,461 --> 01:10:09,800
the uh,

2761
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,760
the ability to aim it.

2762
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:14,780
There was a shooting in a school where
the kid shot eight kids in his classroom

2763
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:15,980
and none of the Swat team,

2764
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:16,843
when they looked at the,

2765
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:17,571
what happened,

2766
01:10:17,571 --> 01:10:20,570
he was shooting kids in the head as
they were running and catching them and

2767
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:22,820
headshots squeezing them
off and they were like,

2768
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,170
we don't have anybody who can do that.

2769
01:10:24,171 --> 01:10:26,450
I mean that's kind of a
physical assault side thing.

2770
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:27,351
He,

2771
01:10:27,351 --> 01:10:28,500
but the kid had been doing that,

2772
01:10:28,501 --> 01:10:29,630
he'd been shooting whatever,

2773
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:29,991
you know.

2774
01:10:29,991 --> 01:10:30,380
Yeah.

2775
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:31,310
So he was,

2776
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:33,990
by the time he was 16
he was an expert with a,

2777
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:34,580
with a gun.

2778
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:38,150
But wonder if there's going to be less
car accidents because of video games for

2779
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:40,850
kids or I wonder like if you
were to go back like 10 years,

2780
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:42,680
like if they have better
hand on coordination.

2781
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:43,071
Yeah,

2782
01:10:43,071 --> 01:10:43,790
it makes sense.

2783
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:46,640
Cars are also going to be communicating
with each other thing though,

2784
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:47,331
you know,

2785
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:49,160
especially when you're
shifting gears and stuff.

2786
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:53,600
So this thing went 20 times
faster than the speed of sound.

2787
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:57,860
Why fast enough to fly from New
York to Los Angeles in 12 minutes?

2788
01:10:57,910 --> 01:10:59,030
I'm gonna tell you how fast that is.

2789
01:10:59,031 --> 01:11:02,390
750 miles an hour as the speed of sound.

2790
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:04,400
It went for nine minutes.

2791
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:04,711
It,

2792
01:11:04,711 --> 01:11:05,544
it flew.

2793
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,960
But apparently this thing could go.

2794
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:12,080
It could go from New York to
La in less than 12 minutes.

2795
01:11:12,081 --> 01:11:13,560
My fucking God.

2796
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:13,750
What?

2797
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:13,990
What?

2798
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:14,823
What was that?

2799
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:17,490
It could go to New York to
La and less than 12 minutes.

2800
01:11:17,491 --> 01:11:19,070
1,000 times faster than this speed.

2801
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,390
One t times the speed of sound.

2802
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:21,751
Okay.

2803
01:11:21,751 --> 01:11:22,680
And you know how fast that is?

2804
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:25,110
That's 15,000 miles an hour.

2805
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:25,980
Wow.

2806
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:29,430
Actually thirteen thousand
thirteen thousand miles an hour.

2807
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:30,601
That's what this thing is.

2808
01:11:30,601 --> 01:11:30,930
Okay.

2809
01:11:30,930 --> 01:11:32,490
The result gaps is speed.

2810
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:34,350
It's actually a little less than 20 times.

2811
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:35,191
Well,

2812
01:11:35,191 --> 01:11:35,701
you know what,

2813
01:11:35,701 --> 01:11:38,310
actually I think it's
capable of more than that.

2814
01:11:38,311 --> 01:11:40,600
I think what they're saying
is if 13,000 miles an hour,

2815
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:41,910
the skin peeled off of it,

2816
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:44,720
thousand miles an hour.

2817
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:46,490
Oh my God.

2818
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:48,860
13,000 miles in an hour.

2819
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,540
What are you talking about?

2820
01:11:50,541 --> 01:11:51,860
Jesus Christ.

2821
01:11:51,861 --> 01:11:55,400
Think about how fucking fast that they
would be flew to New York and how long?

2822
01:11:55,401 --> 01:11:56,420
12 minutes from where?

2823
01:11:56,630 --> 01:12:00,950
Well it couldn't make it cause it burnt
to death and nine minutes post the fuel

2824
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:01,911
at all.

2825
01:12:01,911 --> 01:12:03,200
No Adderall.

2826
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:04,161
It's coke.

2827
01:12:04,161 --> 01:12:04,990
It runs on coke.

2828
01:12:04,990 --> 01:12:05,823
Exactly.

2829
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:10,460
Knew what if they found the cocaine
was like the best fuel ever.

2830
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:14,720
Well in some ways it is and you
could use it to get to the moon.

2831
01:12:14,721 --> 01:12:15,160
No problem.

2832
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,000
A while burn for a little while.

2833
01:12:17,001 --> 01:12:17,970
You feel visible.

2834
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:21,610
If you figured out how to put it into
some sort of an engine that made a

2835
01:12:21,611 --> 01:12:22,211
combustion,

2836
01:12:22,211 --> 01:12:23,820
it's only possible with cocaine and,

2837
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:24,520
well that's it.

2838
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:24,971
That's the thing.

2839
01:12:24,971 --> 01:12:26,430
It's like trying to come up with like,

2840
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:27,220
like you know,

2841
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:29,470
fuel that really is that way.

2842
01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:30,363
I guess we are,

2843
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,070
well we were going to have to because
it's going to run out of fucking oil.

2844
01:12:33,071 --> 01:12:33,461
It's going to,

2845
01:12:33,461 --> 01:12:34,660
it might be a hundred years from now.

2846
01:12:34,661 --> 01:12:35,494
It might be 50 years,

2847
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:37,440
but eventually it looks
like it's gonna run.

2848
01:12:37,441 --> 01:12:38,620
The cars are already running.

2849
01:12:38,621 --> 01:12:39,454
I mean I got,

2850
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:41,540
you don't even have a car.

2851
01:12:41,541 --> 01:12:42,830
So it's a dishwasher.

2852
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:44,480
A man who's so manly.

2853
01:12:44,481 --> 01:12:46,280
Why do you not have a Shelby Mustang?

2854
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:47,600
Because I come with me,

2855
01:12:47,601 --> 01:12:48,800
come with me to the dealership.

2856
01:12:48,801 --> 01:12:49,400
Let me tell you something.

2857
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:49,851
I don't think,

2858
01:12:49,851 --> 01:12:50,570
you know,

2859
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:51,021
I don't think,

2860
01:12:51,021 --> 01:12:51,351
you know,

2861
01:12:51,351 --> 01:12:51,741
I don't think,

2862
01:12:51,741 --> 01:12:54,710
I think you're missing out because I
don't think you've ever experienced like

2863
01:12:54,711 --> 01:12:55,790
you and I go on to buy a game.

2864
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:56,000
Bread.

2865
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:56,833
Pitbull.

2866
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:57,170
Yeah,

2867
01:12:57,170 --> 01:12:58,140
I remember that very well.

2868
01:12:58,590 --> 01:12:58,950
Very well.

2869
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:00,140
And I had to come late duty.

2870
01:13:00,141 --> 01:13:00,560
It's,

2871
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,700
we go find this complete
bad and know how to draw.

2872
01:13:02,701 --> 01:13:03,431
Drive a stick shift,

2873
01:13:03,431 --> 01:13:03,621
right?

2874
01:13:03,621 --> 01:13:03,721
Yeah.

2875
01:13:03,721 --> 01:13:05,490
You're going to drive my gt
three when we get out of here.

2876
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,250
Okay.

2877
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:07,130
You have some money.

2878
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:08,930
You should get a fun car.

2879
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,040
I shouldn't even have to floss.

2880
01:13:10,041 --> 01:13:13,760
Get a God Damn Mustang gt or a
Ford edge or Ford edge is not.

2881
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:14,660
Not what I'm talking about.

2882
01:13:14,661 --> 01:13:15,494
I'm going to coffee.

2883
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,130
Tea was,

2884
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:16,820
they're fun.

2885
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:17,331
They're fun.

2886
01:13:17,331 --> 01:13:20,030
It's a fucking big v eight
400 something horsepower,

2887
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:20,841
but I drive too much.

2888
01:13:20,841 --> 01:13:22,340
I've got a tough fill it
up with gas all the time.

2889
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:24,590
So you go to the gas station,

2890
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:26,060
it takes five minutes.

2891
01:13:26,061 --> 01:13:26,691
Don't be a pussy.

2892
01:13:26,691 --> 01:13:27,800
You know when you need gas,

2893
01:13:27,801 --> 01:13:28,640
you don't need gas.

2894
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:29,401
Get yourself what?

2895
01:13:29,401 --> 01:13:30,480
God Damn Mentally car.

2896
01:13:30,481 --> 01:13:31,314
You would love it.

2897
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:33,320
Call it God damn.

2898
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,510
Dodge SRT eight challenger.

2899
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:37,160
That's what fun of those channels has.

2900
01:13:37,161 --> 01:13:38,280
That's what I'll talk about.

2901
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:38,721
See,

2902
01:13:38,721 --> 01:13:39,381
he's happy.

2903
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:40,780
I bet it sticks you with a race.

2904
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:42,230
I bet he's happy.

2905
01:13:42,231 --> 01:13:42,880
I was in it yesterday.

2906
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:43,713
I got seasick.

2907
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,020
I got carsick.

2908
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,040
I bet he was happy though.

2909
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,170
Did you feel you can't drive slowly?

2910
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:49,700
He looked pretty happy though.

2911
01:13:49,701 --> 01:13:50,240
Didn't he?

2912
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:51,380
CanNot drive slowly.

2913
01:13:51,381 --> 01:13:52,161
Hanes is giant.

2914
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:56,050
Va has cars need to be monsters
and totally inappropriate.

2915
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:56,903
It's perfect.

2916
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:57,950
It's wheels or that fat.

2917
01:13:57,951 --> 01:13:59,090
He's enjoying his life.

2918
01:13:59,150 --> 01:13:59,331
Yeah.

2919
01:13:59,331 --> 01:14:00,164
The challenger,

2920
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:01,370
there's kind of scrawny.

2921
01:14:01,371 --> 01:14:01,490
We,

2922
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:01,941
he's got the,

2923
01:14:01,941 --> 01:14:02,930
he's got the racing,

2924
01:14:02,931 --> 01:14:03,970
he's got the SRE.

2925
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,520
Expensive package.

2926
01:14:05,570 --> 01:14:06,110
That's great.

2927
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:07,130
Those cars are a,

2928
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:09,170
they don't have that well that
well because it's a big car.

2929
01:14:09,171 --> 01:14:11,150
It's like more than
4,000 pounds I believe.

2930
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:11,620
Yeah.

2931
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:16,620
You mean even though I have the
Shelby gt 500 and that's like 3,800 or

2932
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:17,870
something.

2933
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:18,100
That's,

2934
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:21,520
they're pretty heavy in comparison to
like the Porsche is like 3000 pounds.

2935
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:25,480
Porsche is really light and when
you get a big heavy car like that,

2936
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:27,430
it's fucking really hard to make handle.

2937
01:14:27,431 --> 01:14:31,780
But in straight lines and in some ways
the challenges like one of the last real

2938
01:14:31,781 --> 01:14:33,910
old school muscle cars really,

2939
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:34,600
and the,

2940
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,740
and the Mustang Gt,

2941
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:36,581
you know the,

2942
01:14:36,581 --> 01:14:37,030
the,

2943
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:38,530
the gt 500 the Shelby,

2944
01:14:38,531 --> 01:14:38,770
it's,

2945
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:40,090
it's still stupid.

2946
01:14:40,091 --> 01:14:42,090
It's like way too much power for the bay.

2947
01:14:42,091 --> 01:14:45,130
And then the new ones that are coming
out with new ones that have 650

2948
01:14:45,131 --> 01:14:45,964
horsepower,

2949
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:48,760
mine has five 50 and it's ridiculous.

2950
01:14:48,761 --> 01:14:49,521
Five five,

2951
01:14:49,521 --> 01:14:52,060
five 50 and it's sounds majestic.

2952
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:53,830
It makes your balls feel good.

2953
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:55,260
Like when you hear the noise.

2954
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:57,360
See I,

2955
01:14:57,361 --> 01:14:58,480
I've driven other cars.

2956
01:14:58,481 --> 01:15:01,330
Like if I had to pick what's my best car,

2957
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:02,290
I would say the Porsche,

2958
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:03,041
the Gt three,

2959
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:03,874
the race car.

2960
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:05,203
That's a great car,

2961
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:07,300
but it's not as stupid.

2962
01:15:07,301 --> 01:15:09,010
Put a big stupid grin on your face.

2963
01:15:09,011 --> 01:15:13,780
Fun is Shelby's more fun because it's
got a big dumb and Jen and when you hit

2964
01:15:13,781 --> 01:15:14,471
the gas he goes,

2965
01:15:14,471 --> 01:15:15,920
but it's an American.

2966
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:18,040
It's American versus German.

2967
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:18,940
It's America.

2968
01:15:18,941 --> 01:15:19,750
Fuck yeah,

2969
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:21,310
it's got low end torque.

2970
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:23,450
Like it throws you back
in the seat with a Ba.

2971
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:26,950
They should have made this
should've just added balls to it.

2972
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:31,810
This challenge is the only starts off
at 24 and it gets 27 miles per gallon,

2973
01:15:31,811 --> 01:15:33,340
which is actually really good.

2974
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:37,000
It gets 15 car.

2975
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:38,170
It's a fucking,

2976
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:39,790
your car only goes 52.

2977
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:41,550
If you drive like a girl,

2978
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:43,350
you're telling her,

2979
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:44,331
you tell me that,

2980
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:45,164
that the uh,

2981
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:48,520
that actually it gets not as good
gas mileage as your BMW or something.

2982
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:50,500
An m on an m three,

2983
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:53,110
not even a regular BMW if
you take it on a track.

2984
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:53,950
Oh really?

2985
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:54,371
Yes.

2986
01:15:54,371 --> 01:15:55,204
Top gear.

2987
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,170
I love them to death.

2988
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,340
Those guys out of the England,

2989
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:58,720
Jeremy Clarkson,

2990
01:15:59,100 --> 01:15:59,361
uh,

2991
01:15:59,361 --> 01:16:01,250
went around a track and he had a,

2992
01:16:01,251 --> 01:16:02,560
a BMW m three,

2993
01:16:02,561 --> 01:16:06,250
and he floored it and the guy tried to
keep up with him or he didn't know he had

2994
01:16:06,251 --> 01:16:08,230
to keep up with the guy in the Prius.

2995
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:09,064
That's all he had to do.

2996
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:10,420
And the BMW,

2997
01:16:10,421 --> 01:16:15,040
it was much easier for the BMW to keep
up like a really easy for the BMW and

2998
01:16:15,041 --> 01:16:15,531
easy pace,

2999
01:16:15,531 --> 01:16:16,750
like 90 miles an hour
or something like that.

3000
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,050
Where's the Prius was fucking
struggling to keep it up.

3001
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:22,090
So the Prius actually burnt more gas.

3002
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:23,201
It's up.

3003
01:16:23,201 --> 01:16:23,711
He says,

3004
01:16:23,711 --> 01:16:24,544
Shit,

3005
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:26,320
you're a man.

3006
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:28,060
What about the euro man?

3007
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:30,580
And get away from me with that.

3008
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,070
You need a Goddamn challenger
with a sketch shift to you.

3009
01:16:33,071 --> 01:16:33,670
Pussy.

3010
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:35,260
Don't get the automatic traffic.

3011
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:36,370
That's what I'm talking about.

3012
01:16:36,371 --> 01:16:37,540
That's part of being a man.

3013
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,820
We gotta be able to
fucking keep it in neutral.

3014
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:41,260
Would you really recommend
a challenge that,

3015
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:41,951
fuck yeah,

3016
01:16:41,951 --> 01:16:42,641
I would recommend.

3017
01:16:42,641 --> 01:16:43,880
Why didn't know is this cheap food?

3018
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,860
I would want my Joe gets irrational a sec.

3019
01:16:45,861 --> 01:16:47,260
Come on baby.

3020
01:16:47,261 --> 01:16:48,280
It's traffic in La.

3021
01:16:48,281 --> 01:16:49,240
Stick shift.

3022
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:49,690
Yeah.

3023
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:50,650
I want an horsepower.

3024
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:51,491
I might buy one.

3025
01:16:51,491 --> 01:16:51,690
Uh,

3026
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:53,440
one of those when my mustangs leases up.

3027
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:53,920
I might,

3028
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,150
I might get one of the
fucking buy a horse sex.

3029
01:16:56,210 --> 01:16:57,280
I would trade my car in.

3030
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:57,760
I,

3031
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:58,181
yeah,

3032
01:16:58,181 --> 01:16:58,961
that's a good car.

3033
01:16:58,961 --> 01:17:00,430
If you're going to trade
it in for a challenger,

3034
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:01,370
that's a great car.

3035
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:01,551
Can,

3036
01:17:01,551 --> 01:17:02,021
what are you dry?

3037
01:17:02,021 --> 01:17:03,100
So make solid cars,

3038
01:17:03,101 --> 01:17:03,490
man.

3039
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:04,570
And they're fun to drive.

3040
01:17:04,571 --> 01:17:05,710
It's sounds cool.

3041
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:07,150
It's easy to see out of,

3042
01:17:07,151 --> 01:17:07,984
you know,

3043
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:09,560
gimme gimme gimme another car.

3044
01:17:09,561 --> 01:17:10,080
What about that?

3045
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,180
Get them manly car.

3046
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:14,060
I can't tell you what you should get.

3047
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:14,961
We should get,

3048
01:17:14,961 --> 01:17:16,460
it's like a fucking nine 11.

3049
01:17:16,461 --> 01:17:17,600
Get a new Porsche.

3050
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,880
They have a new nine nine one oh yeah.

3051
01:17:19,881 --> 01:17:21,230
You don't even have to
drive a stick shift.

3052
01:17:21,231 --> 01:17:24,290
They have a dual clutch
transmission that paddle shifting.

3053
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:26,870
Really if you got some cash
and you ready to party,

3054
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:28,453
it's fun.

3055
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,560
You don't have to drive your responsible.

3056
01:17:30,561 --> 01:17:32,840
You just merging on the highway.

3057
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:37,280
Drove I drove a Arnold Schwarzenegger
is old Porsche cause my buddy had it in

3058
01:17:37,281 --> 01:17:39,920
his lot and I was like in
first gear the whole time.

3059
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:40,790
I can't go anywhere.

3060
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:42,170
Well traffic.

3061
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,350
Yeah well you know you're going to
get a little bit of that but you can,

3062
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:48,470
if you want to buy a new car you can
get a car that has a dual clutch.

3063
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:51,890
I bought the three 35 I BMW a great car.

3064
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:53,380
I couldn't drive it though either.

3065
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:54,021
I was just always,

3066
01:17:54,021 --> 01:17:56,750
I can never open it up as long
as it just felt like it was,

3067
01:17:56,751 --> 01:17:58,700
it wanted to go and I could
and I felt like I kept,

3068
01:17:58,701 --> 01:18:00,440
I was keeping a dog in a cage really.

3069
01:18:00,441 --> 01:18:03,370
Cause I have the m three and it always
feels like that's like my favorite.

3070
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:04,880
The way you live out there,

3071
01:18:04,881 --> 01:18:05,241
you can,

3072
01:18:05,241 --> 01:18:06,410
you got some open road too,

3073
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:07,340
even if you don't,

3074
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:07,990
you know,

3075
01:18:07,990 --> 01:18:11,060
I think the monitoring I
do fascinating about it.

3076
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:11,450
Yeah.

3077
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:15,230
I love technology and my
favorite technologies like
interactive technology is

3078
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:17,540
cars because they're connected.

3079
01:18:17,541 --> 01:18:17,990
Well,

3080
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:18,471
first of all,

3081
01:18:18,471 --> 01:18:22,850
because I'm an idiot and
I see these amazing things
like computers and I'm like,

3082
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:24,021
who the fuck?

3083
01:18:24,021 --> 01:18:25,190
How is this possible?

3084
01:18:25,191 --> 01:18:26,001
Who is doing this?

3085
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:29,120
How are they making this even
what they do with the Mustang?

3086
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:32,510
I love the fact that they've
taken this really shit design.

3087
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:33,890
It's a live axle car.

3088
01:18:33,891 --> 01:18:35,660
It doesn't even have
independent rear suspension.

3089
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:36,330
What does that mean?

3090
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:37,011
That means the,

3091
01:18:37,011 --> 01:18:37,261
the,

3092
01:18:37,261 --> 01:18:37,670
the,

3093
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:42,670
the back rear tires act on one giant axle
as opposed to a much more modern car.

3094
01:18:42,771 --> 01:18:46,310
Like the Porsche has active
independent suspension.

3095
01:18:46,311 --> 01:18:47,090
So,

3096
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:48,830
so if you go over a bump at the right,

3097
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,930
the right absorbs it,

3098
01:18:50,931 --> 01:18:51,571
the left does,

3099
01:18:51,571 --> 01:18:53,270
and it keeps you planted
to the ground better.

3100
01:18:53,450 --> 01:18:54,610
If you hit a bump in the shell,

3101
01:18:54,611 --> 01:18:56,540
but you're fucking whole
asset goes up in the air.

3102
01:18:56,541 --> 01:18:57,920
It's just stupid design.

3103
01:18:58,190 --> 01:19:01,430
But they've taken that
to the utmost limits.

3104
01:19:01,431 --> 01:19:05,060
Like they've really done the best job
to harness like describing a by design.

3105
01:19:05,061 --> 01:19:05,710
It's like it's not,

3106
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:06,920
it's not like an MMA fighter.

3107
01:19:06,921 --> 01:19:09,330
It's like just a huge fucking a gorilla.

3108
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:14,020
It's a gorilla that's just wants to
stomp on the gas and it can corner the,

3109
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,180
especially the um,

3110
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:18,620
the coops that convertibles a
little flip flopping but the,

3111
01:19:18,621 --> 01:19:18,831
the,

3112
01:19:18,831 --> 01:19:20,060
the coop is pretty stiff.

3113
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:21,080
They corner really good.

3114
01:19:21,081 --> 01:19:22,830
You can get them around
a race track there,

3115
01:19:22,831 --> 01:19:23,091
you know,

3116
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:26,030
and they have the new ones
have a like a sport suspension.

3117
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:28,790
But just as far as like
something that's pure fun,

3118
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:31,130
it fewer fund here on the highway,

3119
01:19:31,131 --> 01:19:32,540
it's pure fun to drive around.

3120
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:34,730
It's hard to beat one of
those Shelby mustangs.

3121
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:35,001
They just,

3122
01:19:35,001 --> 01:19:35,691
the sound of it,

3123
01:19:35,691 --> 01:19:36,800
it's so satisfying.

3124
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:40,430
It's like you're driving a
goddamn sewing machine man.

3125
01:19:40,431 --> 01:19:40,581
Yeah,

3126
01:19:40,581 --> 01:19:41,030
it's true.

3127
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:41,970
It's really even,

3128
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:42,561
even,

3129
01:19:42,561 --> 01:19:43,100
even the,

3130
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:43,670
when I bought,

3131
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:44,421
when I bought that,

3132
01:19:44,421 --> 01:19:47,720
I tell you the story when I
went to at least the Prius,

3133
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:48,261
I go in there and I go,

3134
01:19:48,261 --> 01:19:49,250
I want red.

3135
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,113
And the guy goes,

3136
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:52,660
but you do it because it's,

3137
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:52,940
it's,

3138
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:54,230
it's Barcelona red.

3139
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:55,220
And he goes,

3140
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:57,290
you do you show you them on black.

3141
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,131
He was trying to talk me.

3142
01:19:58,131 --> 01:19:58,400
I go,

3143
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,233
no,

3144
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:00,350
I want red place.

3145
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:03,230
I want to Red Prius and please
refer to it as the Red Ram.

3146
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:04,251
And he's like,

3147
01:20:04,251 --> 01:20:04,581
what do you mean?

3148
01:20:04,581 --> 01:20:04,850
I go,

3149
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:06,310
it's called the Red Ram and,

3150
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,560
and it has sir your Prius Redding.

3151
01:20:07,561 --> 01:20:08,070
I go,

3152
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:08,311
my,

3153
01:20:08,311 --> 01:20:08,941
what is ready?

3154
01:20:08,941 --> 01:20:09,774
He goes,

3155
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,130
you're red Ram is ready.

3156
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:14,520
And I made them all stand there and I
drove out with my fingers like this,

3157
01:20:14,521 --> 01:20:17,580
curled like a Ram's horns on
the hog and thing like that.

3158
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:18,571
And I fucking,

3159
01:20:18,571 --> 01:20:19,110
I was like,

3160
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:19,943
gentlemen,

3161
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,060
thank you for your time.

3162
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:23,910
And I just fucking rolled
out of my Prius like this.

3163
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,320
Like a fucking idiot,

3164
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:26,010
eh,

3165
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:28,620
it's called the red rim are so sexy.

3166
01:20:29,330 --> 01:20:29,790
Let me see it.

3167
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:30,151
No one,

3168
01:20:30,151 --> 01:20:31,680
if you want to look up a sick one,

3169
01:20:31,681 --> 01:20:31,921
dude,

3170
01:20:31,921 --> 01:20:36,921
look up the SRT eight and I believe
they're 45 or 40 looking car for their,

3171
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:38,520
their top of the line one.

3172
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:39,300
It's a great,

3173
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:41,190
well now is this challenge
or does this happen?

3174
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:42,140
Independent suspension or,

3175
01:20:42,141 --> 01:20:42,480
yes.

3176
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,050
Yes.

3177
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:43,883
Those do.

3178
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:45,000
Only the Ford Mustang.

3179
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:46,160
It's a really good looking car.

3180
01:20:46,161 --> 01:20:46,441
That's,

3181
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:46,891
that's a,

3182
01:20:46,891 --> 01:20:48,060
that's what fucking dove has.

3183
01:20:48,061 --> 01:20:49,110
Only has the racing one.

3184
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:49,561
Yeah,

3185
01:20:49,561 --> 01:20:51,240
the RT SRT.

3186
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:51,451
Yeah.

3187
01:20:51,451 --> 01:20:52,220
It's ridiculous.

3188
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:52,891
I looked that up.

3189
01:20:52,891 --> 01:20:55,230
Look up the SRT eight challenger.

3190
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:58,710
I love the fact that America is
finally making cool cars again.

3191
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:01,320
For the longest time all
the cars looked like shit.

3192
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:02,340
Like even go,

3193
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:06,090
go back to like old z 28
Camaro's look so stupid.

3194
01:21:06,330 --> 01:21:08,670
And if you compare like
the really old ones,

3195
01:21:08,671 --> 01:21:10,920
like the 1967 69 Camaro's,

3196
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:12,480
there were amazing cars.

3197
01:21:12,481 --> 01:21:15,240
Even the 70 [inaudible] were
works of art works of art.

3198
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,720
Amazing when they're done up.

3199
01:21:16,721 --> 01:21:17,190
Right.

3200
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:20,160
But then something happened and like
the eighties the nineties they were just

3201
01:21:20,161 --> 01:21:23,010
dog shit and now they're
fucking cool again.

3202
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:25,440
Like I saw a Camaro ss the other day.

3203
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:26,520
Some do drove by me.

3204
01:21:26,521 --> 01:21:26,970
I'm like,

3205
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:29,320
that is a great shaped car.

3206
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:30,900
Yeah.

3207
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:32,160
That's the SRT eight.

3208
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:33,000
Yeah.

3209
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,290
That's the most expensive one,

3210
01:21:34,291 --> 01:21:34,531
I think.

3211
01:21:34,531 --> 01:21:34,651
Yeah,

3212
01:21:34,651 --> 01:21:37,110
it's 46 that's the special speed.

3213
01:21:37,111 --> 01:21:37,944
Yellow.

3214
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,200
Maybe I'll get that one.

3215
01:21:40,201 --> 01:21:40,921
Fuck yeah.

3216
01:21:40,921 --> 01:21:41,371
Dude,

3217
01:21:41,371 --> 01:21:42,270
are you crazy?

3218
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,710
That's a fun car to drive.

3219
01:21:43,711 --> 01:21:44,401
Rock Greg.

3220
01:21:44,401 --> 01:21:45,420
Fitzsimmons by the way,

3221
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:47,670
just like you conflicted family man,

3222
01:21:47,671 --> 01:21:48,504
the whole deal.

3223
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:49,350
He uh,

3224
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:50,730
not that you're conflicted
as a family man.

3225
01:21:50,731 --> 01:21:53,220
Conflicted in your ability to express
your masculinity because you have

3226
01:21:53,221 --> 01:21:53,820
children.

3227
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:55,590
He got a Prius and he wanted this so bad.

3228
01:21:55,591 --> 01:21:56,730
He wanted a challenge her so bad.

3229
01:21:56,731 --> 01:21:57,331
He was fucking,

3230
01:21:57,331 --> 01:21:59,750
I almost fucking bought it and he
knows I hate this piece of shit.

3231
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:02,400
He goes and then it doesn't get good
gas mileage because I drive it like an

3232
01:22:02,401 --> 01:22:03,234
asshole.

3233
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:05,070
He's like stomping on the gas.

3234
01:22:05,071 --> 01:22:05,410
Everything.

3235
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:05,790
That's,

3236
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:06,391
that's not me.

3237
01:22:06,391 --> 01:22:06,810
I like,

3238
01:22:06,810 --> 01:22:07,643
I like the way I,

3239
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,290
the way I'm a retard is I'll be in
the backyard with my buddy Kiran,

3240
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:14,310
learning different choke holds and
learning his brand at Jujitsu and boxing.

3241
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:14,730
Dude,

3242
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:16,560
let me tell you something
that Carl make you funnier.

3243
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:17,700
You get in that car,

3244
01:22:17,701 --> 01:22:19,830
it will make you feel like
you're having a good time.

3245
01:22:19,831 --> 01:22:21,330
That's the car that my car,

3246
01:22:21,331 --> 01:22:21,850
that,

3247
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:22,560
that uh,

3248
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:26,910
rides car should have been my
rides car was a hunk of shit.

3249
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:27,361
All right.

3250
01:22:27,361 --> 01:22:30,150
It was a beautiful looking
car and amazing construction,

3251
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:32,430
but it would break down constantly.

3252
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:33,840
People like someone said to me,

3253
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:34,630
why did you get rid of it?

3254
01:22:34,630 --> 01:22:35,463
This is why I got rid of it.

3255
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:37,920
I was driving on the highway
going like 70 miles an hour.

3256
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:43,070
Then 10 minutes later I pull into my
driveway and my by wheel and suspension

3257
01:22:43,771 --> 01:22:46,620
detaches from the frame in my driveway,

3258
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:48,690
clank cargo sideways.

3259
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:49,921
So I get out,

3260
01:22:49,921 --> 01:22:51,570
the wheel is shoved into the fender,

3261
01:22:51,571 --> 01:22:52,500
the fender is dented,

3262
01:22:52,501 --> 01:22:52,950
and I was like,

3263
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:54,690
I was just on the highway with this thing.

3264
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,000
And like these old cars suck.

3265
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:57,381
They,

3266
01:22:57,381 --> 01:22:57,621
they,

3267
01:22:57,621 --> 01:23:00,180
they handle like a rhino on roller skates,

3268
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:03,480
like a drunk rhinoceros on
a fucking ice skating rink.

3269
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:04,710
Terrible.

3270
01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:04,930
They're,

3271
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:05,321
they're there.

3272
01:23:05,321 --> 01:23:06,250
They're all designed,

3273
01:23:06,251 --> 01:23:06,881
fucked up.

3274
01:23:06,881 --> 01:23:08,500
They look amazing though.

3275
01:23:08,501 --> 01:23:09,550
They look incredible.

3276
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:10,540
Will this car,

3277
01:23:10,541 --> 01:23:11,800
what these new challenges are?

3278
01:23:11,801 --> 01:23:12,400
It's like,

3279
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:16,420
here's a car you could fucking actually
drive and it actually has real breaks.

3280
01:23:16,421 --> 01:23:17,370
ABS brakes.

3281
01:23:17,390 --> 01:23:18,210
He's got a real,

3282
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:18,530
you know,

3283
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:21,220
traction management system
and it looks the same.

3284
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:22,720
It's like very similar.

3285
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:23,700
You know,

3286
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:24,430
you're talking about it did that,

3287
01:23:24,430 --> 01:23:25,270
that challenger,

3288
01:23:25,271 --> 01:23:26,560
it looks just like my car.

3289
01:23:26,561 --> 01:23:27,010
It's like,

3290
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:29,500
it's so similar to my Barracuda,

3291
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:32,920
although there's something about those
old barracudas where you knew it was all

3292
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:33,580
metal.

3293
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:37,720
It was just so much more legit with all
that plastic and stuff at gorgeous car.

3294
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:40,060
You sold that for
problem solving for some,

3295
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:40,930
I made some money on it.

3296
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:41,763
Yeah.

3297
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,150
And then I just bought the Porsche.

3298
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,010
So there's so much more fun.

3299
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:46,390
But if I had to choose one,

3300
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:48,910
I would take a Mustang because it's fun.

3301
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:50,350
It's not the best car.

3302
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:50,561
Yeah,

3303
01:23:50,561 --> 01:23:50,831
it does.

3304
01:23:50,831 --> 01:23:51,940
It's got the most refined.

3305
01:23:51,941 --> 01:23:53,650
The interiors made a shit plastic.

3306
01:23:53,970 --> 01:23:55,930
It really is about having fun.

3307
01:23:55,931 --> 01:23:56,890
It's about having fun.

3308
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:58,600
And when I hit the gas in the car,

3309
01:23:58,601 --> 01:23:59,980
and I'm not even talking about going fast,

3310
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:01,550
it's satisfying a blah,

3311
01:24:01,551 --> 01:24:01,870
blah,

3312
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:01,971
blah,

3313
01:24:01,971 --> 01:24:02,720
blah.

3314
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:03,130
My mom,

3315
01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:03,821
even my father,

3316
01:24:03,821 --> 01:24:04,210
he goes,

3317
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:05,530
you guys driving?

3318
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:06,393
What is this thing?

3319
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:08,050
What is it?

3320
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:09,220
And it Doug Davidoff all he says,

3321
01:24:09,221 --> 01:24:09,671
he goes,

3322
01:24:09,671 --> 01:24:10,271
they should call it.

3323
01:24:10,271 --> 01:24:11,830
They should call it instead of the Prius.

3324
01:24:11,831 --> 01:24:12,664
They should call it.

3325
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:13,570
Um,

3326
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:14,200
I won't,

3327
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,900
I won't punch you back no
matter what you do to me.

3328
01:24:18,010 --> 01:24:18,221
Well,

3329
01:24:18,221 --> 01:24:19,060
the thing is,

3330
01:24:19,061 --> 01:24:19,930
the reason why I say this,

3331
01:24:19,931 --> 01:24:20,260
he said,

3332
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:21,760
I know you're not broke.

3333
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:22,481
You have money.

3334
01:24:22,481 --> 01:24:23,800
You're a very successful guy.

3335
01:24:23,801 --> 01:24:25,030
You do very well.

3336
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:28,460
Like you could get a car like
this and it's an easy choice.

3337
01:24:28,461 --> 01:24:32,020
When could I can answer not a
rational for the car and I want that.

3338
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:32,740
That's true.

3339
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:35,110
I looked at the Audi a
five that's got to Twitter.

3340
01:24:35,190 --> 01:24:35,460
Ooh,

3341
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:36,820
that's grew two foci.

3342
01:24:36,821 --> 01:24:39,730
Rich goes talking about
what kind of car to drive.

3343
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:40,720
It's not about that,

3344
01:24:40,721 --> 01:24:41,020
sorry.

3345
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:42,610
It's about seizing passion.

3346
01:24:42,611 --> 01:24:45,280
It's about having fun in
your flux in life and when,

3347
01:24:45,281 --> 01:24:47,500
if you have a car that's
a fun car to drive.

3348
01:24:47,501 --> 01:24:48,220
If you can afford it,

3349
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:49,140
only if you can afford.

3350
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:50,080
If you can't afford it,

3351
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:52,390
it becomes the exact opposite.

3352
01:24:52,391 --> 01:24:55,810
Instead of being this cool thing
becomes this fucking velvet prison.

3353
01:24:55,811 --> 01:24:57,400
You have to drag around
with you everywhere.

3354
01:24:57,610 --> 01:25:01,270
It's slowly sinking you and taking away
your time because you had to work extra

3355
01:25:01,271 --> 01:25:01,990
hours.

3356
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:05,930
I got to say I've had some such such
nice people on Twitter say things too,

3357
01:25:05,950 --> 01:25:08,560
like I get such great feet
like people are just so nice.

3358
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:09,700
I had a guy,

3359
01:25:09,701 --> 01:25:13,450
I wasn't feeling very good about my one
hour special because it was an hour and

3360
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:13,451
a half.

3361
01:25:13,451 --> 01:25:15,580
I wanted to cut it down to 42
minutes to do a lot of reasons.

3362
01:25:15,581 --> 01:25:17,170
It doesn't matter and I
was feeling a little bad.

3363
01:25:17,171 --> 01:25:17,381
I was like,

3364
01:25:17,381 --> 01:25:17,501
Oh,

3365
01:25:17,501 --> 01:25:18,400
I wish I could do it over again.

3366
01:25:18,401 --> 01:25:20,650
We talked about it and a guy tweets me,

3367
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:25,830
this guy tweets me a video of his one
year old daughter laughing her ass off at

3368
01:25:26,561 --> 01:25:27,430
my special.

3369
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:28,181
I was like,

3370
01:25:28,181 --> 01:25:29,710
what a fucking great thing to do.

3371
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:33,010
Literally like tweets it and the kid is
the kid is howling and then he'd go to

3372
01:25:33,011 --> 01:25:37,360
me on the screen and come back to her
face and the kid is fucking howling at my

3373
01:25:37,361 --> 01:25:40,540
jokes and like it was such
a fucking great tweet.

3374
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:41,261
I was like,

3375
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:41,911
what a what that?

3376
01:25:41,911 --> 01:25:43,170
That's what I love about this.

3377
01:25:43,230 --> 01:25:44,260
You know this,

3378
01:25:44,261 --> 01:25:45,640
this whole technology age,

3379
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:48,040
you can't connect a really
good PT Ed brings you.

3380
01:25:48,041 --> 01:25:49,690
It just brings everybody
together and you know,

3381
01:25:50,050 --> 01:25:50,460
I dunno.

3382
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:51,760
It's just like minded people.

3383
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,000
Yeah.

3384
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,451
Like mine,

3385
01:25:52,451 --> 01:25:52,871
like my,

3386
01:25:52,871 --> 01:25:53,140
no,

3387
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:53,950
you're a nice guy.

3388
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:55,510
Nice people are attracted to that.

3389
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:55,900
Yeah.

3390
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:56,080
The,

3391
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:56,321
you know,

3392
01:25:56,321 --> 01:25:57,730
the shows that we've been getting at.

3393
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:58,300
Look,

3394
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:00,580
I filmed my special in
Atlanta a couple of weeks ago.

3395
01:26:00,730 --> 01:26:01,720
The crowds there,

3396
01:26:01,721 --> 01:26:05,360
they're better than any crowd that you
could reasonably hope to ever get in your

3397
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:05,930
life.

3398
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:06,551
I believe it.

3399
01:26:06,551 --> 01:26:07,730
And they're there every show.

3400
01:26:07,731 --> 01:26:09,470
It's like the same kind
of crowds at every show.

3401
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:10,430
While I was in Canada,

3402
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:14,210
I was in Toronto and a Yuk Yuks and I
had a bunch of people that listen to your

3403
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:15,044
podcast,

3404
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:16,430
so they came out to see me.

3405
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:17,151
Oh by the way,

3406
01:26:17,151 --> 01:26:21,860
I'll be in Houston June 14th 15th and
16th at the Houston Improv and then I'll

3407
01:26:21,861 --> 01:26:22,430
be in,

3408
01:26:22,430 --> 01:26:22,640
yeah.

3409
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:23,590
And then I'll be at,

3410
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:24,140
um,

3411
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:25,400
I'm going to be at Kansas City,

3412
01:26:25,401 --> 01:26:26,390
Stanford and sons,

3413
01:26:26,391 --> 01:26:28,100
June 20th 22nd,

3414
01:26:28,130 --> 01:26:29,180
how that guy's classic.

3415
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:29,630
Oh,

3416
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:30,400
Craig correctly.

3417
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,233
Blazer.

3418
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:32,210
Awesome.

3419
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:33,100
Brian Kaylin,

3420
01:26:33,101 --> 01:26:34,220
nobody coming in this week.

3421
01:26:34,221 --> 01:26:36,260
And that's a good,

3422
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:37,720
that's a good Craig laiser right there.

3423
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:39,453
Fried potatoes.

3424
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,330
He's the greatest.

3425
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:42,141
He was the greatest.

3426
01:26:42,141 --> 01:26:47,141
He introduced me to a stripper that had
a tattoo of a stripper on her back and

3427
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:51,950
it looked like a five
year old had drawn it.

3428
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:54,010
I mean it was like the worst tattoo.

3429
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:54,710
It was.

3430
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:56,120
She was such a pretty girl too.

3431
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:59,300
And then I had this spark moment of like,

3432
01:26:59,301 --> 01:27:02,930
this girl needs to be rescued hardcore
at that would have been [inaudible].

3433
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,100
You could totally have taken it.

3434
01:27:04,101 --> 01:27:05,150
She was really pretty.

3435
01:27:05,230 --> 01:27:05,780
Yeah,

3436
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:10,780
but this tattoo was just like this
giant like warning sign that there's

3437
01:27:11,991 --> 01:27:13,580
something really wrong here.

3438
01:27:13,581 --> 01:27:15,500
I like this is complete craziness.

3439
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:16,360
Like it was a,

3440
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,200
the tattoo was so bad,

3441
01:27:18,201 --> 01:27:18,501
man.

3442
01:27:18,501 --> 01:27:20,060
Like you would have to kill the person.

3443
01:27:20,061 --> 01:27:21,350
They'd put that Tattoo on your body.

3444
01:27:21,351 --> 01:27:22,310
You would have to kill them.

3445
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:23,830
There's no way you would ever,

3446
01:27:24,290 --> 01:27:26,810
they would not be able to
pay you enough in court.

3447
01:27:26,811 --> 01:27:27,050
To me,

3448
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:28,850
I've never known what to get as a tattoo.

3449
01:27:28,851 --> 01:27:29,010
I,

3450
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:29,651
that was another thing.

3451
01:27:29,651 --> 01:27:30,484
It just wasn't me.

3452
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:32,110
How bout just man coming up?

3453
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:33,380
Squeeze back man.

3454
01:27:33,381 --> 01:27:34,161
Class man.

3455
01:27:34,161 --> 01:27:36,440
Class and then you see the picture.

3456
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,810
Did you see the picture of my man class?

3457
01:27:38,910 --> 01:27:43,130
I'm going to Brian callen.com and I and
I and they super impose my body to look

3458
01:27:43,131 --> 01:27:43,964
really muscular.

3459
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:48,410
Show show Joe show that it's so stupid
like they like make me look really

3460
01:27:48,411 --> 01:27:49,040
muscular.

3461
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:52,520
How muscular body builder say so dumb.

3462
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:53,631
Why did they do that?

3463
01:27:53,631 --> 01:27:55,190
Did you allow them to I wanted them to,

3464
01:27:55,191 --> 01:27:58,790
I want a two girls who watch him
teach leg and I'm standing with fire.

3465
01:27:58,790 --> 01:27:59,623
It's so cheesy.

3466
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:01,310
It looks like the shittiest,

3467
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:02,400
like they're looking at.

3468
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:05,450
Why would you do that when you can it
would it be even funnier if you did it

3469
01:28:05,451 --> 01:28:06,500
like in your underwear?

3470
01:28:06,501 --> 01:28:07,940
If I wanted to,

3471
01:28:07,941 --> 01:28:08,691
I wanted to,

3472
01:28:08,691 --> 01:28:09,470
but we were like,

3473
01:28:09,470 --> 01:28:09,921
fuck it.

3474
01:28:09,921 --> 01:28:10,201
You know,

3475
01:28:10,201 --> 01:28:12,740
we just had that so creepy
looking at who some are.

3476
01:28:12,741 --> 01:28:17,000
Paul Horace at some big Brazilian guy.

3477
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:17,893
I just saw,

3478
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:22,550
I just saw Fabrizio fair doomed down in
Venice outside Jalina this restaurant

3479
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:23,270
man.

3480
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:23,991
What a stud.

3481
01:28:23,991 --> 01:28:26,120
That guy is fucking stars.

3482
01:28:26,150 --> 01:28:26,930
A big boy.

3483
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:27,141
Yeah,

3484
01:28:27,141 --> 01:28:28,130
he's a big boy.

3485
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:30,350
You don't realize that
the fundings to Boone,

3486
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:31,640
I'm a fruit thrower.

3487
01:28:31,641 --> 01:28:32,660
I live in the trees.

3488
01:28:32,661 --> 01:28:34,340
When that guy's around
and he's a silver back,

3489
01:28:34,341 --> 01:28:35,174
I'm literally like,

3490
01:28:36,290 --> 01:28:36,630
yeah,

3491
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:38,620
if I breach over dooms a bad motherfucker.

3492
01:28:38,621 --> 01:28:41,630
When comes Jitsu do you see that fight
with Roy Nelson and took Roy Nelson's

3493
01:28:41,631 --> 01:28:43,670
back like within seconds of the fight?

3494
01:28:43,671 --> 01:28:46,460
Roy through a big punch missed
and from Breeshia had his back.

3495
01:28:47,190 --> 01:28:48,390
Oh there's,

3496
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:48,890
I was just,

3497
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:49,491
I was watching him.

3498
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:51,590
He was just sitting on the
curb actually and he was,

3499
01:28:51,591 --> 01:28:52,530
I think it was texting and I,

3500
01:28:52,531 --> 01:28:53,810
and I looking at him
and I said to my buddy,

3501
01:28:53,811 --> 01:28:54,290
I go,

3502
01:28:54,290 --> 01:28:55,700
I think I'm right about this.

3503
01:28:55,730 --> 01:28:58,010
If on the ground on the ground,

3504
01:28:58,011 --> 01:29:01,560
there may be one other person on
the planet that could actually have,

3505
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:01,980
you know,

3506
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,110
tap that guy or maybe who knows,

3507
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:05,843
maybe not.

3508
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:06,900
What he's great at,

3509
01:29:06,901 --> 01:29:07,290
man.

3510
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:07,650
His,

3511
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:09,630
his fucking guard is ridiculous.

3512
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:09,811
Yeah.

3513
01:29:09,811 --> 01:29:11,640
He's one of the hardest
guys to ground and pound.

3514
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:13,260
Like Ryan Parsons who's a,

3515
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:18,030
he manages mayhem but I used to manage
king mo and a lot of those guys who would

3516
01:29:18,031 --> 01:29:21,500
talk about when they would be training
with Fabrice like the ground and pound

3517
01:29:21,501 --> 01:29:22,470
just did not work on them.

3518
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:26,430
He was just so good at pretty feed
on hips and his guard is so active.

3519
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:28,710
I mean he's a fucking
top of the food chain,

3520
01:29:28,711 --> 01:29:33,711
black belt and really good off his back
for a giant man natural to 60 yeah.

3521
01:29:34,261 --> 01:29:36,480
I mean he's a big fucking guy,

3522
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:37,403
you know.

3523
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:38,431
No steroids.

3524
01:29:38,431 --> 01:29:39,780
He's just a natural to six.

3525
01:29:39,781 --> 01:29:42,510
So good at like his
dexterity with his legs,

3526
01:29:42,511 --> 01:29:43,344
like moving his legs.

3527
01:29:43,370 --> 01:29:44,970
That's why like when fade or fell fella,

3528
01:29:44,971 --> 01:29:45,511
his guard,

3529
01:29:45,511 --> 01:29:47,430
I remember watching it
and my eyes went up.

3530
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:48,570
I was like really?

3531
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:51,810
Like how ballsy as this guy and then all
of a sudden he caught fader or in the

3532
01:29:51,811 --> 01:29:52,770
triangle and I'm just like,

3533
01:29:52,771 --> 01:29:53,670
he's fuck man.

3534
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:54,030
I'm like,

3535
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:55,320
this is not a regular triangle.

3536
01:29:55,321 --> 01:29:56,890
You are not getting out of that site.

3537
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:59,430
And then when he started breaking
his arm fade or finally tapped,

3538
01:29:59,730 --> 01:30:00,421
but watching it,

3539
01:30:00,421 --> 01:30:01,070
I was like,

3540
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:02,460
as soon as fader I went to his garden,

3541
01:30:02,461 --> 01:30:03,930
my immediate instinct was like,

3542
01:30:03,931 --> 01:30:04,471
wow,

3543
01:30:04,471 --> 01:30:05,310
like that's crazy.

3544
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:06,480
This guy's crazy.

3545
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:09,120
Like why would you think that you
could get locked up by this dude?

3546
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:09,991
And then I thought about it,

3547
01:30:09,991 --> 01:30:10,231
I was like,

3548
01:30:10,231 --> 01:30:11,880
he probably never fought anybody.

3549
01:30:11,881 --> 01:30:15,630
Like we're doomed his whole life except
for Minataro and Minataro couldn't catch

3550
01:30:15,631 --> 01:30:15,751
him.

3551
01:30:15,751 --> 01:30:17,880
So he probably felt if
Minotauro couldn't catch him,

3552
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:19,320
this guy can't catch him either.

3553
01:30:19,770 --> 01:30:22,230
But that's how good Febreeze
over dooms guard is.

3554
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:23,820
Probably the best heavyweight garden.

3555
01:30:23,821 --> 01:30:26,550
MMA next to Frank Mir is
pretty God damn good too,

3556
01:30:26,551 --> 01:30:26,791
man.

3557
01:30:26,791 --> 01:30:29,940
A Frank Mir is hatches you
so good at your Jitsu him.

3558
01:30:29,970 --> 01:30:31,290
He's so explosive too.

3559
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:32,910
And he breaks shit man.

3560
01:30:32,911 --> 01:30:33,361
He's like,

3561
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:33,661
no,

3562
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:36,780
no one has had the record of
breaking shit in the MMA world.

3563
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:40,040
Frank Mir ways against high
level guys almost broke Bach.

3564
01:30:40,270 --> 01:30:44,490
If Steve Mazzagatti had fucked up for one
extra second because he missed the tap

3565
01:30:44,491 --> 01:30:46,440
and he didn't rush it
and stop it quick enough.

3566
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,900
If it had gone on for just
a couple extra seconds,

3567
01:30:48,901 --> 01:30:50,070
that need could've blown out.

3568
01:30:50,071 --> 01:30:50,730
Scares me.

3569
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:52,140
He broke Tim Sylvia his arm,

3570
01:30:52,141 --> 01:30:53,730
and then of course he
broke Nogueira's arm.

3571
01:30:53,731 --> 01:30:54,420
I mean,

3572
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:55,920
he's a big boy too.

3573
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:57,810
Here's a solid to 60.

3574
01:30:57,811 --> 01:30:58,830
Now he's going to fight.

3575
01:30:58,850 --> 01:30:59,070
Uh,

3576
01:30:59,070 --> 01:30:59,561
Mr,

3577
01:30:59,561 --> 01:30:59,850
uh,

3578
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:04,620
just fight for the title does something
in May that's going to be a fuck.

3579
01:31:04,621 --> 01:31:04,801
Yeah.

3580
01:31:04,801 --> 01:31:05,790
That's going to be amazing.

3581
01:31:05,790 --> 01:31:06,623
I can't wait for that.

3582
01:31:06,630 --> 01:31:08,160
I really was hoping to see over him.

3583
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:09,053
And of course,

3584
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:10,043
yeah.

3585
01:31:10,290 --> 01:31:14,130
Apparently Overeem says that
he took a shot by a doctor.

3586
01:31:14,131 --> 01:31:17,250
There was an antiinflammatory and it had
testosterone in it and he didn't know

3587
01:31:17,251 --> 01:31:18,084
about it.

3588
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:20,580
And this doctor is a,

3589
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:21,050
a,

3590
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:25,170
a apparently a very controversial
doctor and the doctor's,

3591
01:31:25,171 --> 01:31:26,004
uh,

3592
01:31:26,010 --> 01:31:29,220
he did put on 50 pounds
of muscle and listen,

3593
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:30,270
it's only 50.

3594
01:31:30,330 --> 01:31:30,961
It's just 50.

3595
01:31:30,961 --> 01:31:31,741
Pick about muscle,

3596
01:31:31,741 --> 01:31:32,251
any thirties.

3597
01:31:32,251 --> 01:31:35,640
But I'm sure that was all eating
a lot of steak and drinking horse.

3598
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:36,550
Know what it was.

3599
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:37,180
Okay.

3600
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:38,160
That horse me interesting.

3601
01:31:38,161 --> 01:31:40,500
Have you ever seen 60 stakes stacked up?

3602
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:42,150
Go to the supermarket,

3603
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,820
go to the supermarket?

3604
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:47,170
They just stop and think
about six pull ups.

3605
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:48,720
It's from pullups enrolling Jujitsu.

3606
01:31:48,721 --> 01:31:48,961
Dude,

3607
01:31:48,961 --> 01:31:49,520
what are you talking about?

3608
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:49,741
I said,

3609
01:31:49,741 --> 01:31:50,730
I don't care how it got there,

3610
01:31:50,731 --> 01:31:52,110
just keep it on and it looks great.

3611
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:52,801
He looks good.

3612
01:31:52,801 --> 01:31:53,940
It's God Damn Superhero.

3613
01:31:53,970 --> 01:31:54,600
I met him,

3614
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:58,170
I met him and talked to him for a brief
a little bit and when he was about his

3615
01:31:58,171 --> 01:32:00,130
Brock fight and he nothing but respectful

3616
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:00,701
things to listen.

3617
01:32:00,701 --> 01:32:00,881
Men,

3618
01:32:00,881 --> 01:32:01,970
all the roads in the world,

3619
01:32:01,971 --> 01:32:03,100
there's only going to do you so much.

3620
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:03,401
Good.

3621
01:32:03,401 --> 01:32:03,600
What?

3622
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:07,540
What does Allister over him good is
that he can fight his fucking ass off.

3623
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:08,980
He's a scary fighter.

3624
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,250
You can talk all the
shit you want about his,

3625
01:32:11,251 --> 01:32:12,084
his roids,

3626
01:32:12,330 --> 01:32:12,790
you know,

3627
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:13,090
uh,

3628
01:32:13,090 --> 01:32:18,090
that may or may not have
taken the acquire trains hard.

3629
01:32:18,281 --> 01:32:18,700
He's a,

3630
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:21,190
he's a very tactical filed fighter dude.

3631
01:32:21,191 --> 01:32:23,230
His fucking fight with Brock was,

3632
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:23,680
you know,

3633
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,491
a beat down.

3634
01:32:24,491 --> 01:32:24,791
That was,

3635
01:32:24,791 --> 01:32:27,490
that was a good convincing
fight to let Brock Lesnar.

3636
01:32:27,491 --> 01:32:30,640
Now he does not want to have any
part of any people like that.

3637
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:33,880
When he kicked him in the body and
you saw that shit cake to the liver.

3638
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:36,590
I don't think in your thirties like
Brock and in your late thirties there,

3639
01:32:36,591 --> 01:32:37,241
whatever it was,

3640
01:32:37,241 --> 01:32:39,040
you can't learn how to be at hot.

3641
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,310
You can't strike it.

3642
01:32:40,311 --> 01:32:41,170
Strike no way.

3643
01:32:41,230 --> 01:32:42,700
Not with high level guys,

3644
01:32:42,701 --> 01:32:43,181
no way.

3645
01:32:43,181 --> 01:32:47,260
So ridiculous like a punch and he's
essentially a blue belt and striking a big

3646
01:32:47,261 --> 01:32:50,890
strong athletic blue belt and he's
taking on a 10th degree black belt,

3647
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:52,650
take it on a k one grand Prix chance.

3648
01:32:52,651 --> 01:32:53,440
Not going to happen.

3649
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:57,040
I mean Alistair Overeem as far as
like decorated fighters in MMA,

3650
01:32:57,041 --> 01:32:59,170
he's the most decorated striker period.

3651
01:32:59,171 --> 01:33:02,770
He won the Grand Prix even though
Badr Hari wasn't in it that year.

3652
01:33:02,830 --> 01:33:04,690
He still won the Goddamn Grand Prix.

3653
01:33:04,730 --> 01:33:05,200
He's,

3654
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,790
that's no one's ever done that.

3655
01:33:06,791 --> 01:33:08,770
And then been in a high level MMA guy,

3656
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:10,211
those Dutch,

3657
01:33:10,211 --> 01:33:11,710
he came out of those ducks schools,

3658
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:12,960
which are the best camp.

3659
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:15,110
And then you got the just,

3660
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:15,511
you're not going to,

3661
01:33:15,511 --> 01:33:18,610
you're not going to be able to hang with
bang with dudes who didn't doing that

3662
01:33:18,611 --> 01:33:20,410
for the past 10 years
and now you're trying,

3663
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:22,550
I mean I get so technical to Dutch,

3664
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,140
got to give,

3665
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:26,650
so you got to give Brock Lesnar a
lot of credit or anybody obviously,

3666
01:33:26,651 --> 01:33:26,801
you know,

3667
01:33:26,801 --> 01:33:29,800
I have such respect for anybody
who gets in that fucking octagon.

3668
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:30,521
I won't,

3669
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:30,900
but it's,

3670
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:31,241
it's just,

3671
01:33:31,241 --> 01:33:32,170
it's really hard to,

3672
01:33:32,171 --> 01:33:33,010
it's really hard to,

3673
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:33,101
I,

3674
01:33:33,101 --> 01:33:36,280
when I watched him lose to Cain Valasquez
and I remember thinking to myself,

3675
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:37,090
I said,

3676
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:37,241
I,

3677
01:33:37,241 --> 01:33:39,910
it's really hard to meet
those hands when you're,

3678
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:40,803
when you're,

3679
01:33:40,810 --> 01:33:41,830
you can't just,

3680
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:43,300
you know,

3681
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:46,750
Bang with and protect yourself against
a guy who's been boxing that long.

3682
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:48,010
It's really hard to do.

3683
01:33:48,220 --> 01:33:49,060
It's very hard to do,

3684
01:33:49,061 --> 01:33:52,250
especially when you're coming off
of fucking surgery to your bowel.

3685
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:53,680
And Kane can also,

3686
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:54,490
Cain is used,

3687
01:33:54,490 --> 01:33:57,130
he'll take a punch and punch him
in the face and he keeps his eyes.

3688
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:58,480
Did he have the cane fight?

3689
01:33:58,720 --> 01:33:59,141
Did He,

3690
01:33:59,141 --> 01:33:59,591
did that?

3691
01:33:59,591 --> 01:34:02,230
Was that fight presurgery how did it go?

3692
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:03,370
Uh,

3693
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:04,800
I believe that 12 inches.

3694
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:05,950
No,

3695
01:34:05,950 --> 01:34:07,150
I think that was after,

3696
01:34:07,151 --> 01:34:09,370
I believe it was because
he had diverticulitis.

3697
01:34:09,371 --> 01:34:09,611
Right,

3698
01:34:09,611 --> 01:34:09,851
right.

3699
01:34:09,851 --> 01:34:12,910
I think what happened was he
had the cane fight and then,

3700
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:13,420
um,

3701
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:15,580
then he was supposed
to have another fight,

3702
01:34:15,970 --> 01:34:19,000
then realized when he was supposed
to fight junior dos Santos,

3703
01:34:19,030 --> 01:34:19,420
right?

3704
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:19,840
Yeah.

3705
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:23,420
And then he realized that he had to
back out because of divergent died.

3706
01:34:23,450 --> 01:34:25,840
I think he had 12 inches
of his colon removed.

3707
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:26,693
God Damn.

3708
01:34:26,830 --> 01:34:27,160
Yeah.

3709
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:28,660
The whole thing is just so crazy.

3710
01:34:28,661 --> 01:34:30,730
The fact that it came from,

3711
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:31,360
you know,

3712
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:34,480
eating meat without fiber and
that it can be that dangerous.

3713
01:34:34,481 --> 01:34:34,661
Yeah.

3714
01:34:34,661 --> 01:34:35,111
That it can,

3715
01:34:35,111 --> 01:34:38,340
it can back up inside your
body and the walls of your,

3716
01:34:38,341 --> 01:34:41,360
your lining of your gut
get caked with excess.

3717
01:34:41,370 --> 01:34:44,890
What it was creates abscesses and it can
actually eat its way through the wall

3718
01:34:44,891 --> 01:34:46,060
and the lining of your body.

3719
01:34:46,061 --> 01:34:48,670
It's a super duper dangerous and uh,

3720
01:34:48,671 --> 01:34:52,480
apparently cleared it up initially
with diet and they were worried that,

3721
01:34:52,481 --> 01:34:52,820
you know,

3722
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:53,710
you're going to need surgery,

3723
01:34:53,711 --> 01:34:54,760
but he cleared it up with Diet.

3724
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:56,230
But then as he's training,

3725
01:34:56,231 --> 01:34:56,960
the real heavy,

3726
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:59,750
high level training breaks your
immune system down so much.

3727
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:03,320
It started coming back and then they
realize that this is a damaged area that's

3728
01:35:03,321 --> 01:35:04,580
never going to quite fully heal,

3729
01:35:04,581 --> 01:35:05,660
so we have to cut it out.

3730
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:09,560
So then they went in there and they cut
out 12 inches of his colon and then put

3731
01:35:09,561 --> 01:35:10,430
it all back together.

3732
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:14,170
And then he took a shot
to his ribs by Alice,

3733
01:35:14,210 --> 01:35:16,070
which is like getting
hit by a safari jeep.

3734
01:35:16,370 --> 01:35:16,700
Okay.

3735
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:17,660
That's a good way of putting it.

3736
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:18,500
Yeah,

3737
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:19,370
that's what it's like.

3738
01:35:19,371 --> 01:35:23,630
If you look at the kick to Overeem's
foot is pulled towards him,

3739
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:27,650
which accentuates the bone
of the Shin and he's just,

3740
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:28,431
Oh my God,

3741
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:29,600
that's a big technique.

3742
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:32,570
Giant legs slamming in your body.

3743
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:33,470
I was watching,

3744
01:35:33,471 --> 01:35:37,700
I remember watching boss Rutten
kick a bag at Beverly Hills Jujitsu.

3745
01:35:37,701 --> 01:35:41,870
This is like literally 12 years ago and
I was watching him around house kick

3746
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:46,900
this bag and I was just like the power
and the force of that guy that just,

3747
01:35:46,941 --> 01:35:47,774
that I was just like,

3748
01:35:47,810 --> 01:35:50,090
I mean hit a lot of our athlete.

3749
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:50,571
That was just,

3750
01:35:50,571 --> 01:35:51,410
I remember thinking to myself,

3751
01:35:51,530 --> 01:35:54,950
getting kicked in the leg or
the side with that you're done.

3752
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:57,410
You should see boss kicking the pads.

3753
01:35:57,590 --> 01:35:59,930
There's like videos of him
kicking the tie pounds.

3754
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,310
He did it very differently.

3755
01:36:01,311 --> 01:36:02,150
Like a lot of guys,

3756
01:36:02,151 --> 01:36:03,290
what they would do was they would,

3757
01:36:03,291 --> 01:36:03,560
uh,

3758
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:07,430
they would hit the pads and or hit the
bag and they would sort of like pace

3759
01:36:07,431 --> 01:36:07,941
themselves.

3760
01:36:07,941 --> 01:36:08,121
You know,

3761
01:36:08,121 --> 01:36:08,954
they do around,

3762
01:36:08,990 --> 01:36:10,010
but they wouldn't throw everything.

3763
01:36:10,011 --> 01:36:13,010
Full blast boss would throw every punch,

3764
01:36:13,070 --> 01:36:14,750
every kick 100%.

3765
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:15,171
He goes,

3766
01:36:15,171 --> 01:36:16,580
that's what I do 100%.

3767
01:36:17,030 --> 01:36:17,450
He's like,

3768
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:17,721
you know,

3769
01:36:17,721 --> 01:36:18,231
I start off,

3770
01:36:18,231 --> 01:36:19,250
I can only do 30 seconds.

3771
01:36:19,251 --> 01:36:19,881
So that's what I would do.

3772
01:36:19,881 --> 01:36:23,330
I do 32nd rounds going a hundred percent
guys was really good at keeping things

3773
01:36:23,331 --> 01:36:24,260
light and you know,

3774
01:36:24,261 --> 01:36:25,094
you guys fighting,

3775
01:36:25,310 --> 01:36:27,050
like he was always good
at just being playful.

3776
01:36:27,051 --> 01:36:28,550
I think that's how we
dealt with the pressure,

3777
01:36:28,551 --> 01:36:28,910
you know?

3778
01:36:28,910 --> 01:36:29,091
Well,

3779
01:36:29,091 --> 01:36:29,340
he,

3780
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:29,991
what his,

3781
01:36:29,991 --> 01:36:31,760
his strategy for training
was that he would,

3782
01:36:31,761 --> 01:36:32,030
uh,

3783
01:36:32,030 --> 01:36:35,870
he would do one minute full blast
as much as you can do full blast.

3784
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:38,180
And then he would start
adding time onto that.

3785
01:36:38,330 --> 01:36:38,591
You know,

3786
01:36:38,591 --> 01:36:39,890
he'd do a minute and 10 seconds,

3787
01:36:39,891 --> 01:36:40,650
maybe 20 seconds.

3788
01:36:40,650 --> 01:36:41,121
Next thing you know,

3789
01:36:41,121 --> 01:36:41,780
it's two minutes.

3790
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:42,440
Next thing you know,

3791
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:43,700
he can go five minutes,

3792
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,290
like a fucking Jackhammer.

3793
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:46,490
This in this book,

3794
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:47,570
a extreme fear.

3795
01:36:47,571 --> 01:36:48,171
It's really interesting.

3796
01:36:48,171 --> 01:36:48,831
They do a study,

3797
01:36:48,831 --> 01:36:52,730
a clinical study of fear and they do
and fear in different forms like fear,

3798
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:53,120
uh,

3799
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:53,990
combat fear,

3800
01:36:54,170 --> 01:36:54,411
uh,

3801
01:36:54,411 --> 01:36:54,691
and,

3802
01:36:54,691 --> 01:36:54,910
and,

3803
01:36:54,910 --> 01:36:55,940
and performance fear.

3804
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:56,120
Uh,

3805
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:58,790
whether you're a performer or
whether you're an opera singer,

3806
01:36:58,791 --> 01:36:59,361
you're an actor,

3807
01:36:59,361 --> 01:37:01,370
but mainly athletes.

3808
01:37:01,371 --> 01:37:04,850
And a lot of athletes get
that what they call the Yips,

3809
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:05,631
like in the,

3810
01:37:05,631 --> 01:37:07,490
in the middle of their career
when they're a high level,

3811
01:37:07,491 --> 01:37:11,330
like all of a sudden they can't throw
a baseball over a plate yet they're the

3812
01:37:11,331 --> 01:37:11,901
best pitcher,

3813
01:37:11,901 --> 01:37:12,500
you know?

3814
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:16,160
And it's because what happens
is people start to watch them.

3815
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:17,450
Dan Jensen.

3816
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:17,750
Uh,

3817
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:18,531
I think that's his name,

3818
01:37:18,531 --> 01:37:20,630
that the most decorated
speed skater of all time.

3819
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:22,970
He three Olympics in a row.

3820
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:23,250
He,

3821
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:25,670
he just fucking just kept choking.

3822
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:26,420
Really.

3823
01:37:26,420 --> 01:37:29,120
He kept choking until
finally he just gave up.

3824
01:37:29,121 --> 01:37:29,451
He just,

3825
01:37:29,451 --> 01:37:32,090
because he got into his own head and
he had to learn how to talk to him.

3826
01:37:32,091 --> 01:37:32,960
So finally he goes,

3827
01:37:32,961 --> 01:37:33,794
fuck it,

3828
01:37:34,010 --> 01:37:35,900
I guess I'll just skate
this thousand meter.

3829
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:36,240
Any,

3830
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:39,980
any apologize to Wisconsin
ahead of time to say,

3831
01:37:39,981 --> 01:37:40,760
hey guys,

3832
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:41,630
I'm going to fucking,

3833
01:37:41,631 --> 01:37:42,310
uh,

3834
01:37:42,310 --> 01:37:43,370
I'm not going to win this.

3835
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:44,000
Sorry.

3836
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:44,331
Sorry.

3837
01:37:44,331 --> 01:37:45,380
Milwaukee or sorry,

3838
01:37:45,381 --> 01:37:46,214
Wisconsin.

3839
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:49,250
And because he gave up and there
was no pressure on him whatsoever.

3840
01:37:49,251 --> 01:37:50,390
He won the fucking gold.

3841
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:55,320
And they talk about how a lot of athletes
and a lot of people in general that

3842
01:37:55,321 --> 01:37:56,070
fear that

3843
01:37:56,070 --> 01:38:00,690
second guessing that self doubt when
you're working on a high level and trying

3844
01:38:00,691 --> 01:38:04,500
to be get would be the best at something
is something that you have to come to

3845
01:38:04,501 --> 01:38:05,334
terms with.

3846
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:08,010
And there are psychological
techniques in which to deal with it.

3847
01:38:08,011 --> 01:38:12,000
But it's so interesting to me that like
human beings that perform on such a high

3848
01:38:12,001 --> 01:38:15,270
level and have so much success
and get so good at something,

3849
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:17,520
still have dragons to slay,

3850
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:20,310
they still have fucking
psychological dragons to slay.

3851
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:21,270
It never ends.

3852
01:38:21,271 --> 01:38:23,190
You know when you really
have a dragon to slay,

3853
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:25,440
when you think that you
don't have a drug and a slay,

3854
01:38:25,470 --> 01:38:26,790
that's when you really fucked.

3855
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,590
And that's what happens
to a lot of people.

3856
01:38:28,591 --> 01:38:29,790
They reach a certain point,

3857
01:38:29,791 --> 01:38:30,930
whether it's artistically,

3858
01:38:30,931 --> 01:38:32,220
whether it's athletically,

3859
01:38:32,370 --> 01:38:35,370
they reach a certain point where they
feel like they've made it or there beyond

3860
01:38:35,371 --> 01:38:35,910
reproach.

3861
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:37,890
Those are not hungry or growing anymore.

3862
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:41,760
And the stagnation sets in and
then mediocrity coming next.

3863
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:42,331
Absolutely.

3864
01:38:42,331 --> 01:38:42,631
And you know,

3865
01:38:42,631 --> 01:38:44,490
and one of the things I
always find with young people,

3866
01:38:44,491 --> 01:38:44,791
you know,

3867
01:38:44,791 --> 01:38:46,170
and I think a lot of young
people listen to this,

3868
01:38:46,171 --> 01:38:47,020
is that they,

3869
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:47,371
they,

3870
01:38:47,371 --> 01:38:47,790
you know,

3871
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:49,440
self doubt always stops people,

3872
01:38:49,530 --> 01:38:52,080
but you got to realize
that successful people,

3873
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:54,540
all successful people have self doubt.

3874
01:38:54,690 --> 01:38:56,790
They'd just learn not to indulge it.

3875
01:38:56,850 --> 01:39:00,480
They learn to ignore it or they
learned to make it how they use it.

3876
01:39:00,481 --> 01:39:01,320
To their advantage.

3877
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:03,120
Self doubt is a human,

3878
01:39:03,150 --> 01:39:04,440
it's a human emotion.

3879
01:39:04,441 --> 01:39:05,280
It's there.

3880
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:08,010
Not believing in yourself is human,

3881
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:10,110
but you can learn how to deal with that.

3882
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:12,450
That should never stop
you from going for things.

3883
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,280
So what if you don't believe in yourself?

3884
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:15,450
So take the action anyway.

3885
01:39:15,451 --> 01:39:16,710
Take the first fucking stack,

3886
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:17,280
right?

3887
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:18,300
That's what you see with this.

3888
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:18,531
And we're,

3889
01:39:18,531 --> 01:39:20,420
one of the things I think is so
interesting because you see people with,

3890
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:21,840
oh this is great,

3891
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:25,500
this guy who's this therapist I was
so he deals with a lot of top CEOs,

3892
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:30,501
like big time fucking people who run
huge corporations and they don't want

3893
01:39:30,571 --> 01:39:31,830
anybody knowing that they see him.

3894
01:39:31,831 --> 01:39:32,664
But he'll deal,

3895
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:35,520
they'll see him and I'll bill out
at 500 bucks an hour or whatever.

3896
01:39:35,521 --> 01:39:35,971
But he is,

3897
01:39:35,971 --> 01:39:36,930
he gets results.

3898
01:39:37,050 --> 01:39:37,381
And I said,

3899
01:39:37,381 --> 01:39:38,370
what's the over,

3900
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:41,370
what's the overriding
thing you have to help?

3901
01:39:41,371 --> 01:39:43,050
Very successful people with,

3902
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:45,250
I'm talking about big
time business leaders and,

3903
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:46,980
and big time athlete.

3904
01:39:47,010 --> 01:39:48,030
And you know what he said?

3905
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:49,830
He was talking about business leaders.

3906
01:39:49,831 --> 01:39:50,664
He goes,

3907
01:39:50,730 --> 01:39:51,360
um,

3908
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,370
most of them feel like frauds.

3909
01:39:54,330 --> 01:39:55,140
And I went,

3910
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:55,973
really?

3911
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:56,641
And he goes,

3912
01:39:56,641 --> 01:39:57,060
yeah,

3913
01:39:57,060 --> 01:39:59,400
most of them feel like they don't
deserve to be where they are.

3914
01:39:59,430 --> 01:40:00,990
They feel like they're
going to be found out.

3915
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:03,210
They feel generally like their frauds.

3916
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:06,760
Like they just got there
by fucking just to,

3917
01:40:06,810 --> 01:40:09,900
the gods smiled on them and now they're
hearing what the fuck do they do?

3918
01:40:10,230 --> 01:40:10,860
And I was like,

3919
01:40:10,860 --> 01:40:11,221
God,

3920
01:40:11,221 --> 01:40:12,510
that's crazy shit.

3921
01:40:12,690 --> 01:40:15,990
You see these people who've run entire
corporations and in their hearts they

3922
01:40:15,991 --> 01:40:16,740
feel like,

3923
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:17,221
I'm like,

3924
01:40:17,221 --> 01:40:18,570
they feel like complete frauds.

3925
01:40:18,870 --> 01:40:19,411
That's healing.

3926
01:40:19,411 --> 01:40:23,240
You have to have a certain amount of
humility to achieve excellence in,

3927
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:24,330
in that humility,

3928
01:40:24,331 --> 01:40:28,770
there's gonna come a an observing
eye upon you that's so critical.

3929
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:29,641
You're yourself.

3930
01:40:29,641 --> 01:40:33,210
Observations are so much more critical
than anybody else's observations to you.

3931
01:40:33,211 --> 01:40:36,360
If you're good at it because you
know yourself more than anybody does,

3932
01:40:36,361 --> 01:40:37,920
you're with yourself 24 hours a day.

3933
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:39,390
So a guy like that,

3934
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:39,961
of course,

3935
01:40:39,961 --> 01:40:40,920
is going to look at himself going,

3936
01:40:40,921 --> 01:40:42,000
you fucking pussy.

3937
01:40:42,001 --> 01:40:43,260
You're freaking this whole thing.

3938
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:44,520
Because really his,

3939
01:40:44,521 --> 01:40:47,820
his way of looking at himself is he's
not really impressed with themselves.

3940
01:40:47,830 --> 01:40:48,090
Right.

3941
01:40:48,090 --> 01:40:49,140
Which is why he's done so well.

3942
01:40:49,170 --> 01:40:51,060
And I couldn't watch my one hour special.

3943
01:40:51,061 --> 01:40:52,200
I fucking hated it.

3944
01:40:52,230 --> 01:40:53,340
I want to know what the funk,

3945
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:55,480
I know I'm much better taking it.

3946
01:40:55,481 --> 01:40:55,720
Yeah.

3947
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:55,991
Yeah.

3948
01:40:55,991 --> 01:40:57,220
You gotta be careful with that.

3949
01:40:57,221 --> 01:40:59,200
You could really fuck your head up again.

3950
01:40:59,201 --> 01:41:00,130
Watch my old shit.

3951
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:02,680
If I watch my old shit
disgusted with myself.

3952
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:03,543
I'm the same way.

3953
01:41:03,570 --> 01:41:06,750
Lapi timing and I thought I
was great and then fucking you.

3954
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:07,990
I'm killing the room.

3955
01:41:07,991 --> 01:41:08,800
The audience going quest.

3956
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:09,633
Then I watched and I'm like,

3957
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:11,140
what the fuck is this?

3958
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:12,550
You know what's really fucked up man?

3959
01:41:12,551 --> 01:41:14,410
Try watching some old comedy.

3960
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:15,100
I mean,

3961
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:16,750
you're growing and you're getting better,

3962
01:41:16,751 --> 01:41:18,370
but try watching some shit from like,

3963
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:22,270
you know Bob Hope from like the
1950s try watching that's dated.

3964
01:41:22,290 --> 01:41:23,230
Did my God,

3965
01:41:23,231 --> 01:41:23,801
is it dated?

3966
01:41:23,801 --> 01:41:24,611
It's close up.

3967
01:41:24,611 --> 01:41:24,821
You know,

3968
01:41:24,821 --> 01:41:27,010
Kinda holds up fucking Don Rickles.

3969
01:41:27,190 --> 01:41:27,730
Oh yeah.

3970
01:41:27,730 --> 01:41:28,690
Oh my God.

3971
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:29,390
He holds up.

3972
01:41:29,390 --> 01:41:30,220
He's still around.

3973
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:30,451
Yeah,

3974
01:41:30,451 --> 01:41:30,610
he's,

3975
01:41:30,610 --> 01:41:31,600
he's still throwing down.

3976
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:33,100
He was just in Vegas in April.

3977
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:35,280
Jesus Christ tweets Don Rickles.

3978
01:41:35,490 --> 01:41:35,680
Right?

3979
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:36,550
It does get Twitter.

3980
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:37,451
What's his Twitter?

3981
01:41:37,451 --> 01:41:40,210
He said to Bob Saget when Bob
Saget was doing dirty work.

3982
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:41,380
He was directing a thing.

3983
01:41:41,381 --> 01:41:41,770
And Bob,

3984
01:41:41,770 --> 01:41:43,420
he comes to set and he goes,

3985
01:41:43,630 --> 01:41:44,463
he goes,

3986
01:41:44,490 --> 01:41:45,470
he got sent to Bob Saget things.

3987
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:46,380
Uh,

3988
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:46,811
yeah,

3989
01:41:46,811 --> 01:41:48,160
I'm here to do this movie for you.

3990
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:50,050
I understand you're directing the movie.

3991
01:41:50,051 --> 01:41:51,730
I told Mr. Martin Scorsese,

3992
01:41:51,731 --> 01:41:52,001
I said,

3993
01:41:52,001 --> 01:41:52,840
I just came from,

3994
01:41:52,841 --> 01:41:53,291
by the way,

3995
01:41:53,291 --> 01:41:56,020
I just told Martin Scorsese
that you were directing a film.

3996
01:41:56,290 --> 01:41:58,510
The man clutched his chest.

3997
01:42:00,230 --> 01:42:01,390
I'm already following them.

3998
01:42:01,630 --> 01:42:02,141
It's done.

3999
01:42:02,141 --> 01:42:02,600
Rick goes,

4000
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:03,161
I gotta fall.

4001
01:42:03,161 --> 01:42:05,470
D.

4002
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:05,470
O.

4003
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:05,470
N.

4004
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:05,470
R.

4005
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:05,470
I.

4006
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:05,470
C.

4007
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:05,470
K.

4008
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:05,470
L.

4009
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:05,470
E.

4010
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:05,800
S.

4011
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:06,820
He's got good tweets.

4012
01:42:07,010 --> 01:42:08,380
Rickles closes a monster.

4013
01:42:08,381 --> 01:42:09,340
Him on a podcast.

4014
01:42:09,341 --> 01:42:10,174
That'd be amazing.

4015
01:42:10,710 --> 01:42:10,960
Yeah.

4016
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:11,793
He's uh,

4017
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:13,420
he's still funny old dude.

4018
01:42:13,421 --> 01:42:14,590
Some guys can keep it up,

4019
01:42:14,591 --> 01:42:15,320
man.

4020
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:15,700
You know,

4021
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:17,590
in comedy it's not,

4022
01:42:17,620 --> 01:42:18,520
there's not that many.

4023
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:20,320
There's a certain age
that a lot of them hit.

4024
01:42:20,321 --> 01:42:21,970
Very few get to be like George Carlin.

4025
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:23,170
He was really funny,

4026
01:42:23,171 --> 01:42:24,070
right till his death.

4027
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:24,481
Well,

4028
01:42:24,481 --> 01:42:24,870
ever since.

4029
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:25,361
It was awesome.

4030
01:42:25,361 --> 01:42:29,260
He also decided somewhere along
the line to not just do jokes.

4031
01:42:29,261 --> 01:42:29,621
He was like,

4032
01:42:29,621 --> 01:42:29,951
I want to,

4033
01:42:29,951 --> 01:42:31,780
I want to talk about
stuff that matters to me.

4034
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:34,390
And he was so prolific.

4035
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:36,400
Look at Don Rickles latest photo.

4036
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:39,160
He has a picture of him
and his cat and army.

4037
01:42:39,190 --> 01:42:40,470
Joan Rivers is almost 90.

4038
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:42,550
Joan Rivers is not don Rickles.

4039
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:43,051
No,

4040
01:42:43,051 --> 01:42:43,191
no,

4041
01:42:43,191 --> 01:42:43,360
no.

4042
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:44,440
I mean there's the latest photo.

4043
01:42:44,441 --> 01:42:45,320
She looks like I can,

4044
01:42:45,370 --> 01:42:45,731
oh,

4045
01:42:45,731 --> 01:42:46,300
okay.

4046
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:49,030
Here's a photo of him and her and like
a green room or something like that and

4047
01:42:49,031 --> 01:42:50,110
she looks like a Puma.

4048
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:51,820
Whoa.

4049
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:52,750
Isn't that weird looking,

4050
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:54,640
uh,

4051
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:55,900
Pulma to,

4052
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:57,240
okay.

4053
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:58,150
Do you remember the time,

4054
01:42:58,580 --> 01:42:58,900
by the way,

4055
01:42:58,900 --> 01:42:59,500
still doing it.

4056
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:00,760
Are you seeing their face man?

4057
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:01,451
Pull up.

4058
01:43:01,451 --> 01:43:02,284
Pull that picture up.

4059
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:04,571
75 years old.

4060
01:43:04,571 --> 01:43:07,120
I went into the green room once,

4061
01:43:07,330 --> 01:43:09,090
the Brayer Improv and uh,

4062
01:43:09,130 --> 01:43:12,490
I just arrived and me and Joey is
smoked weed in the parking lot.

4063
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:18,240
Blitzkrieg that initial
rush of intoxication where
you're really too hot to be

4064
01:43:18,941 --> 01:43:19,421
talking,

4065
01:43:19,421 --> 01:43:20,620
words are not going to come to you.

4066
01:43:20,621 --> 01:43:23,800
You're a wash in a wave
of feeling and weirdness.

4067
01:43:23,801 --> 01:43:25,150
And I sit down,

4068
01:43:25,151 --> 01:43:30,151
I look up and there's some Joan Rivers
reality show and I'm looking at her face.

4069
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:32,410
I'm looking at her poor face.

4070
01:43:32,411 --> 01:43:34,570
And her face is a goddamn masks.

4071
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:35,010
It's,

4072
01:43:35,010 --> 01:43:35,370
it's uh,

4073
01:43:35,370 --> 01:43:36,040
it's a,

4074
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:36,970
it's not a face.

4075
01:43:37,180 --> 01:43:38,020
Look at that.

4076
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:38,913
Come on Joan,

4077
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:39,730
and she's,

4078
01:43:39,730 --> 01:43:41,890
and that's when she's not talking,

4079
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:43,660
but when she's moving,

4080
01:43:43,690 --> 01:43:48,370
it's all so it's all stuffed out there
with like fillers and stuff that keep

4081
01:43:48,371 --> 01:43:50,400
your skin from looking wrinkly there.

4082
01:43:50,401 --> 01:43:52,220
There's a reason they
stretch your skin out.

4083
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:54,710
There's a reason in the
Judeo Christian mythology,

4084
01:43:54,711 --> 01:43:57,080
a vanity is one of the seven deadly sins,

4085
01:43:57,081 --> 01:43:57,251
right?

4086
01:43:57,251 --> 01:43:57,831
It's scary.

4087
01:43:57,831 --> 01:43:58,970
Vanity eats itself.

4088
01:43:58,971 --> 01:44:00,380
It's a snake eating its own tail.

4089
01:44:00,410 --> 01:44:01,310
Pull that picture up again,

4090
01:44:01,311 --> 01:44:01,670
Brian.

4091
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:01,881
You're,

4092
01:44:01,881 --> 01:44:02,380
you're walking,

4093
01:44:02,380 --> 01:44:03,860
you're worshiping false gods.

4094
01:44:03,861 --> 01:44:04,220
You know,

4095
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:05,540
dove and I were talking about that.

4096
01:44:05,541 --> 01:44:08,600
Like what happens to you when you worship
false gods when you worship money,

4097
01:44:08,601 --> 01:44:11,150
shiny things when you
worship even your own looks.

4098
01:44:11,330 --> 01:44:12,170
But that's crazy.

4099
01:44:12,171 --> 01:44:13,310
Some fucking problems.

4100
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:16,400
That's Tom Riddle is actually a little
better looking and a little younger

4101
01:44:16,401 --> 01:44:17,810
looking in some ways and she is,

4102
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:19,640
oh well at least it looks natural.

4103
01:44:19,641 --> 01:44:20,190
If she doesn't,

4104
01:44:20,190 --> 01:44:21,900
doesn't offend you when you look at them.

4105
01:44:21,950 --> 01:44:23,450
It's like Don bears his dad.

4106
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:23,661
Yeah.

4107
01:44:23,661 --> 01:44:23,901
Will you,

4108
01:44:23,901 --> 01:44:24,980
will you look at Don Rickles?

4109
01:44:24,981 --> 01:44:25,880
You like there's a guy,

4110
01:44:25,970 --> 01:44:26,260
hi.

4111
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:26,930
Hi Mister.

4112
01:44:26,930 --> 01:44:27,080
Hi.

4113
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:27,913
How are you sir?

4114
01:44:28,010 --> 01:44:28,731
But if you look at her,

4115
01:44:28,731 --> 01:44:29,031
you're like,

4116
01:44:29,031 --> 01:44:29,661
oh my God,

4117
01:44:29,661 --> 01:44:30,830
this lady is wearing a mask.

4118
01:44:30,831 --> 01:44:31,970
The craziest thing I've ever seen,

4119
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,650
she looks like she has a Kabuki mask.

4120
01:44:34,070 --> 01:44:34,730
Yeah.

4121
01:44:34,730 --> 01:44:35,563
Jesus.

4122
01:44:35,850 --> 01:44:40,230
Gypson drawing with the knows how it's
like straighten out the whole thing and

4123
01:44:40,231 --> 01:44:42,140
she looks like she's
fighting and chief forces,

4124
01:44:42,141 --> 01:44:44,000
like she's like literally
falling through the air.

4125
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:46,790
It doesn't make her happy.

4126
01:44:46,791 --> 01:44:47,450
I don't know.

4127
01:44:47,450 --> 01:44:47,751
I mean,

4128
01:44:47,751 --> 01:44:48,220
does it,

4129
01:44:48,220 --> 01:44:50,750
she's obviously working a lot
and she's happy to be working.

4130
01:44:51,010 --> 01:44:53,120
It does a lot of jokes
about her plastic surgery.

4131
01:44:53,150 --> 01:44:53,361
Yeah.

4132
01:44:53,361 --> 01:44:53,741
But I,

4133
01:44:53,741 --> 01:44:54,890
I think that part,

4134
01:44:54,891 --> 01:44:57,380
that's one of those people that
I think is driven by a whole,

4135
01:44:57,381 --> 01:44:58,280
they can never fill.

4136
01:44:58,281 --> 01:44:58,580
Right.

4137
01:44:58,580 --> 01:44:58,730
He,

4138
01:44:58,730 --> 01:44:59,361
God bless her.

4139
01:44:59,361 --> 01:44:59,781
I love her.

4140
01:44:59,781 --> 01:45:04,781
But I think that she's certainly not
driven by a sense of her own inadequacy in

4141
01:45:05,121 --> 01:45:05,571
some way.

4142
01:45:05,571 --> 01:45:05,770
I mean,

4143
01:45:05,770 --> 01:45:07,130
I heard a documentary's amazing.

4144
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:07,371
I,

4145
01:45:07,371 --> 01:45:07,631
yes,

4146
01:45:07,631 --> 01:45:07,871
I did.

4147
01:45:07,871 --> 01:45:08,410
I,

4148
01:45:08,410 --> 01:45:08,600
but,

4149
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:09,560
but I mean you haven't seen it.

4150
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:10,131
No,

4151
01:45:10,131 --> 01:45:10,830
but I want to see it.

4152
01:45:10,830 --> 01:45:11,663
Brian's on my list.

4153
01:45:11,710 --> 01:45:12,543
Yeah,

4154
01:45:13,110 --> 01:45:14,210
I heard it was really good,

4155
01:45:14,211 --> 01:45:16,320
but it just doesn't seem
entertaining enough from me.

4156
01:45:16,321 --> 01:45:16,970
I don't know.

4157
01:45:16,970 --> 01:45:17,803
I'm sure it's good.

4158
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:18,950
I've heard really good things,

4159
01:45:18,951 --> 01:45:19,191
but,

4160
01:45:19,191 --> 01:45:19,521
but it's,

4161
01:45:19,521 --> 01:45:19,791
it's,

4162
01:45:19,791 --> 01:45:20,331
it's like,

4163
01:45:20,331 --> 01:45:20,900
um,

4164
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:21,860
I think that's somebody who didn't,

4165
01:45:21,861 --> 01:45:23,300
who never came to terms with,

4166
01:45:23,870 --> 01:45:26,450
with what w w who she is.

4167
01:45:26,450 --> 01:45:27,470
She never let go of something.

4168
01:45:27,471 --> 01:45:27,601
Right,

4169
01:45:27,601 --> 01:45:27,690
right,

4170
01:45:27,690 --> 01:45:27,860
right,

4171
01:45:27,860 --> 01:45:28,041
right.

4172
01:45:28,041 --> 01:45:29,770
She's still trying to
hold on it that it's,

4173
01:45:29,771 --> 01:45:30,050
so,

4174
01:45:30,050 --> 01:45:33,620
it's actually a form of madness
to hold onto your youth.

4175
01:45:33,890 --> 01:45:34,670
Like that is,

4176
01:45:34,670 --> 01:45:35,750
is just mad.

4177
01:45:35,780 --> 01:45:36,020
It's,

4178
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:37,460
it's actually crazy.

4179
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:37,761
Well,

4180
01:45:37,761 --> 01:45:38,600
it's also,

4181
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:39,650
it's another pattern.

4182
01:45:40,130 --> 01:45:40,641
It's a pattern.

4183
01:45:40,641 --> 01:45:42,740
Just like the people that stuffed
the fucking plates in their lips.

4184
01:45:42,741 --> 01:45:43,100
Yeah.

4185
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:43,440
There's a,

4186
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:45,650
there's a crazy pattern
of plastic surgery.

4187
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:48,920
There's a lot of women engage in and
they start getting nips and tucks is at

4188
01:45:48,921 --> 01:45:49,190
her.

4189
01:45:49,190 --> 01:45:49,441
Yeah.

4190
01:45:49,441 --> 01:45:50,180
The cost.

4191
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:51,170
Oh my God.

4192
01:45:51,171 --> 01:45:51,740
Look at her.

4193
01:45:51,740 --> 01:45:52,510
She was great.

4194
01:45:52,510 --> 01:45:53,690
She turned it on so we can hear it.

4195
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:54,200
Yeah,

4196
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:55,010
she was great.

4197
01:45:55,010 --> 01:45:57,260
All he has to be as clean and
able to pick up the check.

4198
01:45:57,261 --> 01:45:57,980
He's a winner,

4199
01:45:57,980 --> 01:45:58,813
you know that.

4200
01:45:59,250 --> 01:45:59,570
Well,

4201
01:45:59,570 --> 01:46:02,480
I can call up anybody in the whole world.

4202
01:46:02,481 --> 01:46:03,314
You know that.

4203
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:03,621
Hello?

4204
01:46:03,621 --> 01:46:04,290
I saw your name,

4205
01:46:04,290 --> 01:46:05,070
the locker room.

4206
01:46:05,070 --> 01:46:05,270
What?

4207
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:06,110
I give you a quick call,

4208
01:46:08,090 --> 01:46:08,690
a girl,

4209
01:46:08,690 --> 01:46:10,530
a girl can't call God.

4210
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,710
You had to wait for the phone
to ring night and when you,

4211
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:13,880
when you finally go on a date,

4212
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:15,350
the girl has to be well dressed.

4213
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:16,790
The face has to look nice.

4214
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,440
The hair has to be in shape.

4215
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:23,660
The girl has to be the one that's right
and pretty intelligent up a good sport.

4216
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:25,580
Howard Johnson's again,

4217
01:46:25,581 --> 01:46:26,620
her written here.

4218
01:46:29,490 --> 01:46:30,760
That's actually pretty fun right now.

4219
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:32,271
30 years old.

4220
01:46:32,271 --> 01:46:33,050
You're not married.

4221
01:46:33,050 --> 01:46:33,883
You're an old man,

4222
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:35,213
a man.

4223
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:36,260
He's 90 years old.

4224
01:46:36,261 --> 01:46:37,010
He's not married.

4225
01:46:37,010 --> 01:46:37,843
He's a catch.

4226
01:46:42,910 --> 01:46:43,600
Gosh,

4227
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:44,433
sorry.

4228
01:46:44,700 --> 01:46:45,191
Looking at me.

4229
01:46:45,191 --> 01:46:45,870
Yeah,

4230
01:46:45,870 --> 01:46:46,703
look at it.

4231
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:49,590
Kind of has this Sarah
Silverman type kind in the field

4232
01:46:49,910 --> 01:46:51,200
and bring them along.

4233
01:46:51,201 --> 01:46:52,220
Bring them along.

4234
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:53,180
He's 98

4235
01:46:55,220 --> 01:46:56,120
he's dead.

4236
01:47:00,020 --> 01:47:00,853
Just bring them,

4237
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,740
we'll say he's quiet.

4238
01:47:04,220 --> 01:47:05,700
I know what I'm speaking of back was,

4239
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:08,810
my mother had two of us at home
that warming as the expression goes,

4240
01:47:08,811 --> 01:47:09,644
movie

4241
01:47:13,540 --> 01:47:16,430
from a little town called Larchmont
where if you're not married,

4242
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:20,000
you're a girl and you're over
21 you're better off dead.

4243
01:47:20,090 --> 01:47:20,781
It's that simple.

4244
01:47:20,781 --> 01:47:21,614
You know,

4245
01:47:21,620 --> 01:47:24,410
and I was the last girl in Larchmont.

4246
01:47:25,220 --> 01:47:26,480
Do you know how that feels?

4247
01:47:26,750 --> 01:47:27,980
Sitting around my mother's house,

4248
01:47:27,981 --> 01:47:29,510
2122,

4249
01:47:29,511 --> 01:47:30,344
24.

4250
01:47:30,530 --> 01:47:31,700
Having a good time,

4251
01:47:31,940 --> 01:47:32,451
living,

4252
01:47:32,451 --> 01:47:34,490
eating candy bars and joy myself,

4253
01:47:34,820 --> 01:47:38,540
but single and the neighbors would
come over and they'd sit to my mother.

4254
01:47:38,750 --> 01:47:39,620
How's Jones?

4255
01:47:39,621 --> 01:47:40,580
Still not married.

4256
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,850
And My mother would say if she were alive.

4257
01:47:44,420 --> 01:47:45,530
You know how that hurts.

4258
01:47:45,890 --> 01:47:47,420
I don't want you sitting right there.

4259
01:47:48,450 --> 01:47:49,283
What else?

4260
01:47:49,640 --> 01:47:49,780
Wait

4261
01:47:49,780 --> 01:47:49,940
one,

4262
01:47:49,940 --> 01:47:50,480
my mother said,

4263
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:51,313
oh,

4264
01:47:51,820 --> 01:47:52,790
so it's a little dated,

4265
01:47:52,791 --> 01:47:53,810
but still it's pretty funny.

4266
01:47:53,811 --> 01:47:54,501
She just,

4267
01:47:54,501 --> 01:47:54,800
uh,

4268
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:55,700
she was excellent.

4269
01:47:57,080 --> 01:47:59,940
She makes sure the sex she makes
you try to get her own podcast.

4270
01:48:00,030 --> 01:48:00,351
If he,

4271
01:48:00,351 --> 01:48:00,590
if,

4272
01:48:00,590 --> 01:48:00,981
if,

4273
01:48:00,981 --> 01:48:01,370
uh,

4274
01:48:01,370 --> 01:48:02,300
if she was today,

4275
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:03,410
uh,

4276
01:48:03,410 --> 01:48:03,681
yeah,

4277
01:48:03,681 --> 01:48:05,030
I would love to have her on a park.

4278
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:05,320
No,

4279
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:05,420
no,

4280
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:05,491
no,

4281
01:48:05,491 --> 01:48:05,631
no,

4282
01:48:05,631 --> 01:48:05,730
no.

4283
01:48:05,730 --> 01:48:06,351
That's not what I mean.

4284
01:48:06,351 --> 01:48:06,561
I mean,

4285
01:48:06,561 --> 01:48:07,820
if you saw her back then would you like,

4286
01:48:07,821 --> 01:48:08,330
hey,

4287
01:48:08,330 --> 01:48:09,163
I want to do a podcast.

4288
01:48:11,470 --> 01:48:13,940
You might hear about me on
the Internet and podcast.

4289
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:14,953
I would,

4290
01:48:14,990 --> 01:48:15,770
you would try to hit it.

4291
01:48:15,770 --> 01:48:16,280
Oh fuck.

4292
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:17,113
Yeah.

4293
01:48:17,630 --> 01:48:18,381
I wouldn't actually,

4294
01:48:18,381 --> 01:48:19,390
I never tried to date a,

4295
01:48:19,450 --> 01:48:20,530
a common need now.

4296
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:21,081
Really.

4297
01:48:21,081 --> 01:48:21,914
That's interesting.

4298
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:25,190
I would think you would
because I see you have though,

4299
01:48:25,191 --> 01:48:25,401
right?

4300
01:48:25,401 --> 01:48:25,920
I see the,

4301
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:26,310
no,

4302
01:48:26,310 --> 01:48:26,690
never,

4303
01:48:26,690 --> 01:48:27,170
never.

4304
01:48:27,170 --> 01:48:27,921
I see the,

4305
01:48:27,921 --> 01:48:28,030
uh,

4306
01:48:28,030 --> 01:48:28,401
I love,

4307
01:48:28,401 --> 01:48:28,641
I mean,

4308
01:48:28,641 --> 01:48:28,791
look,

4309
01:48:28,791 --> 01:48:30,140
I love certain comics.

4310
01:48:30,140 --> 01:48:30,381
I like,

4311
01:48:30,381 --> 01:48:31,460
I love Sierra Tiana.

4312
01:48:31,461 --> 01:48:32,750
She's anybody who ever did it.

4313
01:48:32,751 --> 01:48:33,584
Ever will be lucky.

4314
01:48:33,830 --> 01:48:34,161
You know,

4315
01:48:34,161 --> 01:48:34,430
I'm,

4316
01:48:34,430 --> 01:48:34,671
I like,

4317
01:48:34,671 --> 01:48:35,210
I know a lot of fun.

4318
01:48:35,210 --> 01:48:35,790
I agree.

4319
01:48:35,790 --> 01:48:36,950
And I got a lot of friends like that,

4320
01:48:36,951 --> 01:48:37,220
but,

4321
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:37,490
um,

4322
01:48:37,490 --> 01:48:38,060
oh,

4323
01:48:38,060 --> 01:48:39,380
but I mean a lot of like a,

4324
01:48:39,381 --> 01:48:40,180
I love,

4325
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:40,670
uh,

4326
01:48:40,670 --> 01:48:41,810
Eliza slash to slash ginger.

4327
01:48:41,811 --> 01:48:42,680
She's my friend.

4328
01:48:42,681 --> 01:48:43,310
I think she's,

4329
01:48:43,310 --> 01:48:44,001
I just liked her.

4330
01:48:44,001 --> 01:48:45,110
I think that a person's funny,

4331
01:48:45,350 --> 01:48:46,110
but you wouldn't want to do,

4332
01:48:46,110 --> 01:48:46,970
I don't know about that,

4333
01:48:46,971 --> 01:48:48,350
that those two girls I can see,

4334
01:48:48,351 --> 01:48:48,830
you know,

4335
01:48:48,830 --> 01:48:49,880
because their friends are Monica.

4336
01:48:49,910 --> 01:48:51,350
I can see dating someone like that.

4337
01:48:51,351 --> 01:48:52,970
So I don't want to say
I wouldn't date a comic,

4338
01:48:52,971 --> 01:48:53,450
but I,

4339
01:48:53,450 --> 01:48:54,380
it's marching her.

4340
01:48:54,381 --> 01:48:54,651
Yeah,

4341
01:48:54,651 --> 01:48:56,000
I'm just watching her and I kind of,

4342
01:48:56,420 --> 01:48:57,350
I see a lot of,

4343
01:48:57,351 --> 01:48:57,860
um,

4344
01:48:57,860 --> 01:48:58,100
uh,

4345
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:00,650
need to be an overwhelming
need to be loved.

4346
01:49:00,740 --> 01:49:04,700
And that's an end coupled with the fact
that that's her first love when she's on

4347
01:49:04,701 --> 01:49:05,300
stage.

4348
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:06,410
That's lot to compete with.

4349
01:49:06,630 --> 01:49:07,230
You know,

4350
01:49:07,230 --> 01:49:12,050
two comics is tough to make work because
you're both coming together like with

4351
01:49:12,051 --> 01:49:13,490
your own crazy shit.

4352
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:13,970
Yeah.

4353
01:49:13,970 --> 01:49:14,270
You know,

4354
01:49:14,270 --> 01:49:18,170
it works with Thomson [inaudible]
and Christina Brzezinski Day at work.

4355
01:49:18,330 --> 01:49:18,960
Thompson were,

4356
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:19,311
by the way,

4357
01:49:19,311 --> 01:49:20,144
is a great,

4358
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:21,060
awesome guys.

4359
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:21,893
He's a great,

4360
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:25,280
I got to know him recently and we did
this mash up comedy central Mash up

4361
01:49:25,281 --> 01:49:25,880
together.

4362
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:29,090
He's such a fucking nice
supportive dude who's genuine.

4363
01:49:29,091 --> 01:49:29,601
Like you'll be like,

4364
01:49:29,601 --> 01:49:29,720
yeah,

4365
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:30,710
you fucking hilarious.

4366
01:49:30,711 --> 01:49:31,430
You fucking,

4367
01:49:31,430 --> 01:49:31,581
you know,

4368
01:49:31,581 --> 01:49:32,540
he's just a great,

4369
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:34,430
like just one of those
guys not competing with,

4370
01:49:34,431 --> 01:49:34,970
you know,

4371
01:49:34,970 --> 01:49:35,930
he's not trying to one up.

4372
01:49:35,931 --> 01:49:37,790
He's just genuinely happy for you.

4373
01:49:37,791 --> 01:49:38,230
Yeah.

4374
01:49:38,230 --> 01:49:38,420
Yeah.

4375
01:49:38,420 --> 01:49:39,190
He's an awesome dude.

4376
01:49:39,190 --> 01:49:39,500
Yeah.

4377
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:40,280
He's a,

4378
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:41,330
he's a rare gift.

4379
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:42,280
That guy.

4380
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:42,690
We,

4381
01:49:42,690 --> 01:49:43,431
we did that whole,

4382
01:49:43,431 --> 01:49:44,080
um,

4383
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:44,380
uh,

4384
01:49:44,380 --> 01:49:45,560
maxim comic tour,

4385
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:45,800
you know,

4386
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:48,730
with me and half Ron and Charlie and
we did it in every town they had.

4387
01:49:48,730 --> 01:49:50,770
Like a local guy would go
up and do like 10 minutes.

4388
01:49:50,771 --> 01:49:51,340
Yeah.

4389
01:49:51,340 --> 01:49:51,691
And,

4390
01:49:51,691 --> 01:49:52,000
uh,

4391
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,160
we did it in Phoenix
and somehow or another,

4392
01:49:54,161 --> 01:49:54,850
um,

4393
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:55,631
Sigora was on,

4394
01:49:55,631 --> 01:49:56,680
cause he's not really from Phoenix,

4395
01:49:56,681 --> 01:49:57,340
but he was in the area,

4396
01:49:57,340 --> 01:49:57,940
whatever.

4397
01:49:57,940 --> 01:49:58,930
So he went out and I was like,

4398
01:49:58,931 --> 01:49:59,741
Holy Shit,

4399
01:49:59,741 --> 01:50:00,574
this guy's funny.

4400
01:50:00,670 --> 01:50:01,001
And it's,

4401
01:50:01,001 --> 01:50:01,421
it was,

4402
01:50:01,421 --> 01:50:02,140
uh,

4403
01:50:02,140 --> 01:50:02,831
it was like,

4404
01:50:02,831 --> 01:50:06,070
he was so like his timing
and his rhythm are so good.

4405
01:50:06,071 --> 01:50:06,281
I'm like,

4406
01:50:06,281 --> 01:50:07,930
how the fuck do I not know about this guy?

4407
01:50:07,950 --> 01:50:08,200
Yeah.

4408
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:10,180
It's one of those weird
things where I was like,

4409
01:50:10,181 --> 01:50:12,430
it would like kind of
like kind of weird me out.

4410
01:50:12,790 --> 01:50:14,680
Like how come this guy's not famous?

4411
01:50:14,710 --> 01:50:16,480
He kind of lets the
audience reach for him.

4412
01:50:16,510 --> 01:50:16,721
You know,

4413
01:50:16,721 --> 01:50:17,111
it's not,

4414
01:50:17,111 --> 01:50:17,470
it's not,

4415
01:50:17,470 --> 01:50:18,221
that's a different thing.

4416
01:50:18,221 --> 01:50:20,830
She's controlling the space and she's
gonna make you like an no matter what.

4417
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:23,200
So grow is just kind of
sits up there like whatever.

4418
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:24,910
I'm just going to talk and
he's fucking hilarious.

4419
01:50:24,950 --> 01:50:26,050
Got a big bit though.

4420
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:27,153
It does.

4421
01:50:27,390 --> 01:50:28,223
Uh,

4422
01:50:28,610 --> 01:50:30,040
he asked me about it and I was like,

4423
01:50:30,041 --> 01:50:30,281
man,

4424
01:50:30,281 --> 01:50:32,770
really midgets need more
people shitting on them.

4425
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:34,190
You know?

4426
01:50:34,190 --> 01:50:34,550
Also,

4427
01:50:34,550 --> 01:50:35,740
cause I'm friends with Brad Williams,

4428
01:50:35,741 --> 01:50:36,574
so I don't like,

4429
01:50:36,790 --> 01:50:37,623
I love that guy.

4430
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:38,890
He's so good.

4431
01:50:38,890 --> 01:50:40,030
Or a little people rather.

4432
01:50:40,090 --> 01:50:42,110
No Forbes.

4433
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:45,580
There are midgets and not
supposed to ever say midget.

4434
01:50:45,581 --> 01:50:47,840
Apparently you ever see that
fucking out in the office,

4435
01:50:47,841 --> 01:50:49,090
the British one where they're like,

4436
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:49,501
well they're,

4437
01:50:49,501 --> 01:50:50,840
they're all dwarves images.

4438
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,990
There are sprites there or else.

4439
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:53,411
It's like,

4440
01:50:53,411 --> 01:50:54,244
are they real?

4441
01:50:54,370 --> 01:50:54,641
Yes.

4442
01:50:54,641 --> 01:50:58,210
They're real UAT and had this debate
about all the different small people.

4443
01:50:58,510 --> 01:50:59,141
It's fucking,

4444
01:50:59,141 --> 01:50:59,831
you can youtube it.

4445
01:50:59,831 --> 01:51:00,221
It's really,

4446
01:51:00,221 --> 01:51:01,054
really funny.

4447
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:02,230
Have you seen those,

4448
01:51:02,231 --> 01:51:02,410
uh,

4449
01:51:02,410 --> 01:51:04,420
people that they found
that live 10,000 years ago?

4450
01:51:04,421 --> 01:51:06,850
There really were tiny people
in the island of Flores.

4451
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:07,420
No.

4452
01:51:07,420 --> 01:51:08,200
You never seen that?

4453
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:08,561
No.

4454
01:51:08,561 --> 01:51:09,031
The floor,

4455
01:51:09,031 --> 01:51:09,521
his hobbit,

4456
01:51:09,521 --> 01:51:10,180
man.

4457
01:51:10,180 --> 01:51:10,420
Real.

4458
01:51:10,420 --> 01:51:10,811
My God.

4459
01:51:10,811 --> 01:51:11,644
How do you not know about this?

4460
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:12,041
Brian?

4461
01:51:12,041 --> 01:51:13,240
Pull that shit up so Brian can,

4462
01:51:13,241 --> 01:51:13,450
uh,

4463
01:51:13,450 --> 01:51:13,870
look at it.

4464
01:51:13,870 --> 01:51:14,703
That's pretty wild.

4465
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:15,341
Yeah.

4466
01:51:15,341 --> 01:51:18,820
They apparently they lived alongside
humans as recently as 10,000 years ago.

4467
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:19,990
They found their bodies,

4468
01:51:20,290 --> 01:51:20,480
well,

4469
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:21,250
it's like pygmies.

4470
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:22,420
It's like the pygmies in the Congo,

4471
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:23,081
something like that.

4472
01:51:23,081 --> 01:51:24,160
I take it as a very small,

4473
01:51:24,190 --> 01:51:25,270
they were totally different.

4474
01:51:25,450 --> 01:51:27,210
They were a different species of humans.

4475
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:28,390
They had different district,

4476
01:51:28,391 --> 01:51:28,721
you know,

4477
01:51:28,721 --> 01:51:29,170
the,

4478
01:51:29,170 --> 01:51:29,390
their,

4479
01:51:29,390 --> 01:51:30,970
their proportions were different.

4480
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:32,920
I always forget that pygmies exist.

4481
01:51:32,950 --> 01:51:33,461
I know it's weird,

4482
01:51:33,461 --> 01:51:35,440
but I always forget like
sometimes I'll go crazy.

4483
01:51:35,530 --> 01:51:36,340
Holy Shit.

4484
01:51:36,340 --> 01:51:37,270
Pygmies are out there.

4485
01:51:37,271 --> 01:51:39,400
They're fucking pygmies
in the deep and the Congo,

4486
01:51:39,430 --> 01:51:40,190
how tall they are.

4487
01:51:40,190 --> 01:51:41,710
They're like four feet tall.

4488
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:42,150
Wow.

4489
01:51:42,150 --> 01:51:43,030
I'm really muscular.

4490
01:51:43,150 --> 01:51:44,080
So what do you think happened?

4491
01:51:44,081 --> 01:51:44,890
Like there was just like,

4492
01:51:44,890 --> 01:51:46,180
that was the best way to be.

4493
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:47,510
Like if you're going to be living,

4494
01:51:47,580 --> 01:51:48,550
revolve to your,

4495
01:51:48,551 --> 01:51:48,791
yeah,

4496
01:51:48,791 --> 01:51:50,020
you evolved your circumstances.

4497
01:51:50,021 --> 01:51:50,854
Maybe you do.

4498
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:52,360
Maybe if there's not a lot of food.

4499
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:54,190
The ones that survived were smaller.

4500
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:54,791
Uh,

4501
01:51:54,791 --> 01:51:55,480
I don't know.

4502
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:55,711
It's a,

4503
01:51:55,711 --> 01:51:58,240
it's definitely a genetic
mutation mutation.

4504
01:51:58,241 --> 01:51:59,800
It's a genetic strain of people.

4505
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:01,150
They're in their proportion.

4506
01:52:01,151 --> 01:52:01,990
They're not words,

4507
01:52:02,260 --> 01:52:02,860
they're not,

4508
01:52:02,860 --> 01:52:03,700
they're not midgets.

4509
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:05,210
They're just turning small people.

4510
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:05,890
People.

4511
01:52:05,890 --> 01:52:09,580
Have you ever seen the videos holdups
him pygmies rushing in the Congo river.

4512
01:52:10,030 --> 01:52:10,391
Oh my God.

4513
01:52:10,391 --> 01:52:11,230
Look at how cute they are,

4514
01:52:11,620 --> 01:52:12,453
how tall they were.

4515
01:52:12,550 --> 01:52:14,080
That's a depiction of them.

4516
01:52:14,081 --> 01:52:15,130
But there's some better ones.

4517
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:19,570
They're actual more technical ones and
a dude with official over his dick.

4518
01:52:19,930 --> 01:52:20,471
What's up with that?

4519
01:52:20,471 --> 01:52:20,771
That guy.

4520
01:52:20,771 --> 01:52:21,490
We were there.

4521
01:52:21,490 --> 01:52:22,570
The ones in the far right.

4522
01:52:22,810 --> 01:52:23,590
Yeah.

4523
01:52:23,590 --> 01:52:24,423
All those.

4524
01:52:24,460 --> 01:52:25,000
Wow.

4525
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:25,420
Fucking,

4526
01:52:25,420 --> 01:52:26,253
that's weird.

4527
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:26,621
No,

4528
01:52:26,621 --> 01:52:28,300
I meant the one that was
right above that bride.

4529
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:29,741
Yeah.

4530
01:52:29,741 --> 01:52:33,160
That guy that's supposedly
looked like how crazy as well.

4531
01:52:33,490 --> 01:52:33,821
Yeah.

4532
01:52:33,821 --> 01:52:35,530
He's a much more monkey like cheese,

4533
01:52:35,690 --> 01:52:37,750
but it was a type of human being.

4534
01:52:38,170 --> 01:52:39,003
That's incredible.

4535
01:52:39,190 --> 01:52:39,611
Yeah.

4536
01:52:39,611 --> 01:52:42,100
Apparently there was several
different types of human beings.

4537
01:52:42,101 --> 01:52:43,130
Not just neanderthals,

4538
01:52:43,270 --> 01:52:46,010
not just homosapiens the real issue.

4539
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:47,090
And this is the number one issue.

4540
01:52:47,091 --> 01:52:48,110
That other one is him as well.

4541
01:52:48,111 --> 01:52:48,470
Brian,

4542
01:52:48,470 --> 01:52:49,303
the depiction,

4543
01:52:49,580 --> 01:52:52,370
some pygmies pull up that
fake depiction to the,

4544
01:52:52,371 --> 01:52:52,700
uh,

4545
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:52,941
the,

4546
01:52:52,941 --> 01:52:53,211
the,

4547
01:52:53,211 --> 01:52:54,440
the second from the left.

4548
01:52:55,370 --> 01:52:55,611
Yeah.

4549
01:52:55,611 --> 01:52:56,030
That one.

4550
01:52:56,030 --> 01:52:56,301
The,

4551
01:52:56,301 --> 01:52:56,900
the,

4552
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:58,280
that's what he supposedly looked like.

4553
01:52:58,281 --> 01:52:59,330
If it was a really nice,

4554
01:53:00,830 --> 01:53:01,611
if that's a girl,

4555
01:53:01,611 --> 01:53:02,420
not my type,

4556
01:53:02,420 --> 01:53:04,640
he could be at the helm
of like some British band,

4557
01:53:05,870 --> 01:53:06,321
you know,

4558
01:53:06,321 --> 01:53:07,760
some crazy Rawkus British.

4559
01:53:07,761 --> 01:53:08,594
Yeah.

4560
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:09,391
You are correct.

4561
01:53:09,391 --> 01:53:11,750
You Ready to book newsy?

4562
01:53:14,270 --> 01:53:14,691
He,

4563
01:53:14,691 --> 01:53:15,230
um,

4564
01:53:15,230 --> 01:53:15,860
or uh,

4565
01:53:15,860 --> 01:53:16,221
they,

4566
01:53:16,221 --> 01:53:16,460
uh,

4567
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:18,980
they apparently lived alongside
a bunch of other ones that,

4568
01:53:19,130 --> 01:53:20,360
what I was going to say is that what's,

4569
01:53:20,450 --> 01:53:24,890
what's really difficult is that everything
that dies doesn't make a fossil.

4570
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:27,080
So they find fossils,

4571
01:53:27,110 --> 01:53:30,440
but they don't necessarily
have a completely accurate
record of everything that

4572
01:53:30,441 --> 01:53:31,070
ever lived.

4573
01:53:31,070 --> 01:53:32,600
And they don't know how
many holes are missing.

4574
01:53:32,601 --> 01:53:33,770
It's really difficult to tell.

4575
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:34,160
Yeah.

4576
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:34,670
They found,

4577
01:53:34,670 --> 01:53:36,440
they just found some recent fucking thing.

4578
01:53:36,441 --> 01:53:40,700
Some amateur paleontologists found some
recent thing that some seven foot long

4579
01:53:40,701 --> 01:53:43,100
thing with all these w this weird,

4580
01:53:43,101 --> 01:53:44,240
crazy fucking skin.

4581
01:53:44,241 --> 01:53:45,020
They don't know what it was.

4582
01:53:45,020 --> 01:53:45,230
It was,

4583
01:53:45,230 --> 01:53:46,270
we never seen this thing before.

4584
01:53:46,300 --> 01:53:49,070
Some new thing that this is the
first fossil of it they found,

4585
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:50,930
which is try to figure
out what the fuck it is.

4586
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:51,150
Sure.

4587
01:53:51,150 --> 01:53:51,471
They're there.

4588
01:53:51,471 --> 01:53:52,420
I'm sure there were a life forms.

4589
01:53:52,421 --> 01:53:53,160
It just didn't make it.

4590
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:55,490
Do you ever buy the Titan Boa
that they just recently found?

4591
01:53:56,090 --> 01:53:57,410
Holy fucking shit.

4592
01:53:57,411 --> 01:53:57,770
Huh?

4593
01:53:57,770 --> 01:53:58,131
How about,

4594
01:53:58,131 --> 01:53:58,400
uh,

4595
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:00,860
a boa constrictor to each crocodiles?

4596
01:54:00,861 --> 01:54:01,730
Craziest thing in the world.

4597
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:03,170
That's a giant serpent.

4598
01:54:03,171 --> 01:54:06,950
65 foot long animal drag from size.

4599
01:54:07,470 --> 01:54:08,360
There were dragons,

4600
01:54:08,361 --> 01:54:08,631
man.

4601
01:54:08,631 --> 01:54:09,050
Yeah.

4602
01:54:09,050 --> 01:54:09,291
You know,

4603
01:54:09,291 --> 01:54:10,124
and that's the thing that,

4604
01:54:10,130 --> 01:54:14,660
there's a reason why all those myths
exist because things like the Komodo

4605
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:14,720
Dragon,

4606
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:16,250
which by the way will fucking kill you.

4607
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:16,560
Okay.

4608
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:18,600
How about the fucking Nile Crocodile.

4609
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:19,050
Yeah.

4610
01:54:19,050 --> 01:54:21,060
Good luck with those 28 feet long.

4611
01:54:21,061 --> 01:54:24,060
Good luck with the Nile crock about
whim from miles out into the ocean.

4612
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:25,273
Yeah.

4613
01:54:25,770 --> 01:54:27,870
And I talked to a zoologist
in Florida about it.

4614
01:54:27,871 --> 01:54:28,200
They're like,

4615
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:28,771
oh,

4616
01:54:28,771 --> 01:54:31,800
now Kroger house will eat a
tire if you throw a tire at it.

4617
01:54:31,801 --> 01:54:33,060
Sometimes they eat the tire.

4618
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:33,391
I go,

4619
01:54:33,391 --> 01:54:33,691
what do you mean?

4620
01:54:33,691 --> 01:54:34,110
They go,

4621
01:54:34,110 --> 01:54:35,160
they eat everything.

4622
01:54:35,161 --> 01:54:35,491
I said,

4623
01:54:35,491 --> 01:54:35,851
everything.

4624
01:54:35,851 --> 01:54:36,270
He goes,

4625
01:54:36,270 --> 01:54:37,110
everything.

4626
01:54:37,170 --> 01:54:37,771
Oh No.

4627
01:54:37,771 --> 01:54:38,250
Comma,

4628
01:54:38,250 --> 01:54:39,780
they'll grab an elephant by the trunk.

4629
01:54:39,781 --> 01:54:39,991
There's,

4630
01:54:39,991 --> 01:54:40,824
there's video of it.

4631
01:54:41,220 --> 01:54:43,020
Have you seen the video of
these dudes in the Congo?

4632
01:54:43,021 --> 01:54:44,230
The cuda not video,

4633
01:54:44,231 --> 01:54:44,550
rather.

4634
01:54:44,550 --> 01:54:44,941
It's a,

4635
01:54:44,941 --> 01:54:45,241
it was,

4636
01:54:45,241 --> 01:54:45,870
um,

4637
01:54:45,870 --> 01:54:46,920
a thing on CNN.

4638
01:54:46,950 --> 01:54:50,710
There were three adventures on kayaks
and one of them got killed by a crocodile

4639
01:54:50,711 --> 01:54:51,220
off on,

4640
01:54:51,220 --> 01:54:55,920
they're depicting death on the Nile and
it just depicting this crocodile jacking

4641
01:54:55,921 --> 01:54:56,260
them.

4642
01:54:56,260 --> 01:54:56,381
Yeah.

4643
01:54:56,381 --> 01:54:57,420
But here's the thing here.

4644
01:54:57,430 --> 01:54:58,120
Ready?

4645
01:54:58,120 --> 01:54:58,301
Ah,

4646
01:54:58,301 --> 01:54:59,670
I'm not going on the fucking,

4647
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:01,060
I'm not going on the Nile,

4648
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:01,630
but with the one,

4649
01:55:01,630 --> 01:55:02,080
it's like,

4650
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:02,680
it's like,

4651
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:03,271
it's like the,

4652
01:55:03,271 --> 01:55:03,821
the thing I do,

4653
01:55:03,821 --> 01:55:04,330
it's like,

4654
01:55:04,330 --> 01:55:04,630
oh,

4655
01:55:04,630 --> 01:55:07,000
the Nile with I in a fucking Kayak.

4656
01:55:07,060 --> 01:55:07,893
Nah,

4657
01:55:07,970 --> 01:55:08,680
Nah,

4658
01:55:08,680 --> 01:55:09,670
I'll go rock climbing.

4659
01:55:09,671 --> 01:55:10,301
How's that sound?

4660
01:55:10,301 --> 01:55:10,531
In the,

4661
01:55:10,531 --> 01:55:10,841
in the,

4662
01:55:10,841 --> 01:55:13,360
in the Andes or in the Rockies
and I won't even do that.

4663
01:55:13,630 --> 01:55:14,381
Or it's like a,

4664
01:55:14,381 --> 01:55:14,910
it's like,

4665
01:55:14,910 --> 01:55:15,551
how about the guy,

4666
01:55:15,551 --> 01:55:16,800
the woman who got her face eaten by,

4667
01:55:16,810 --> 01:55:17,740
I was thinking about that as she gets,

4668
01:55:17,741 --> 01:55:18,230
she gets checked.

4669
01:55:18,230 --> 01:55:18,760
Yeah.

4670
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:19,810
Hands and face eaten.

4671
01:55:20,050 --> 01:55:23,590
If you've got a 200 pound chimp
just running around the house,

4672
01:55:23,770 --> 01:55:25,390
I'm not fucking common over.

4673
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:25,780
Yeah,

4674
01:55:25,780 --> 01:55:26,980
I'll Skype with you dude.

4675
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:28,360
It's a man creature with six,

4676
01:55:28,361 --> 01:55:28,790
seven times.

4677
01:55:28,790 --> 01:55:30,820
You have a body strength of a grown
man with a three year old's brain.

4678
01:55:31,030 --> 01:55:32,290
That's a bad combination.

4679
01:55:32,550 --> 01:55:32,630
The

4680
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:37,050
crocodile was pulling the Kayak under
like a shape as it was trying to pull the

4681
01:55:37,051 --> 01:55:38,670
guy out of it cause it turned him over.

4682
01:55:38,700 --> 01:55:40,000
Oh my God.

4683
01:55:40,010 --> 01:55:40,500
Grabbed on.

4684
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:42,000
He's still stuck in a kid.

4685
01:55:42,210 --> 01:55:43,410
So he's trying to hang that.

4686
01:55:43,411 --> 01:55:44,010
The crocodile

4687
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:44,843
pulled down.

4688
01:55:44,870 --> 01:55:45,090
No,

4689
01:55:45,090 --> 01:55:45,301
no,

4690
01:55:45,301 --> 01:55:45,511
no,

4691
01:55:45,511 --> 01:55:45,730
no.

4692
01:55:45,730 --> 01:55:47,850
Just went under the water
and they never saw it again.

4693
01:55:48,150 --> 01:55:49,920
I don't want any part of that shit.

4694
01:55:49,950 --> 01:55:50,611
I don't want to die by,

4695
01:55:50,611 --> 01:55:52,530
by 20 plus feet long.

4696
01:55:52,590 --> 01:55:53,550
I don't want to die by biting.

4697
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:57,720
It's why I don't go swimming
in the fucking Santa Monica
Bay cause they're great

4698
01:55:57,721 --> 01:55:58,920
whites all over.

4699
01:55:59,310 --> 01:56:00,061
They just swim around.

4700
01:56:00,061 --> 01:56:01,090
How's that go do,

4701
01:56:01,190 --> 01:56:02,150
do this.

4702
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:05,700
There's a cool video of one that was
taken right off the Malibu coast by a

4703
01:56:05,701 --> 01:56:06,190
helicopter.

4704
01:56:06,190 --> 01:56:09,180
But Sisay just swimming around.

4705
01:56:09,270 --> 01:56:12,120
I know all about the Santa
Monica Bay and great whites.

4706
01:56:12,930 --> 01:56:13,500
I'm old hat.

4707
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:14,430
I'm like saw it.

4708
01:56:14,870 --> 01:56:18,690
I noticed a couple of
deaths and they haunt me.

4709
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:20,910
One of them was a guy that was in,

4710
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:24,480
they were training for a triathlon and
so there was swimming in the ocean and

4711
01:56:24,481 --> 01:56:25,500
there was something,

4712
01:56:25,650 --> 01:56:29,130
there was a quite a few of them and one
guy got bitten half by a great white and

4713
01:56:29,131 --> 01:56:30,330
that was right off of San Diego.

4714
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:32,610
And then recently in Santa Barbara,

4715
01:56:32,611 --> 01:56:35,500
I think last year a guy got
bitten half again cause he was,

4716
01:56:35,501 --> 01:56:36,334
when he was at,

4717
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:38,520
he was a surfing and water.

4718
01:56:38,521 --> 01:56:38,821
He was,

4719
01:56:38,821 --> 01:56:39,630
he was a uh,

4720
01:56:39,630 --> 01:56:39,880
uh,

4721
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:41,880
bodyboarding bodyboarding.

4722
01:56:42,090 --> 01:56:42,923
And guess what?

4723
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:43,561
Well,

4724
01:56:43,561 --> 01:56:48,561
what they found was on nat geo that in
the Santa Monica pier at any given time,

4725
01:56:48,780 --> 01:56:49,990
if I think it's during the fall,

4726
01:56:49,991 --> 01:56:52,590
there are there as many great whites
there as anywhere in the world.

4727
01:56:52,591 --> 01:56:53,460
That's why they come to breathe.

4728
01:56:53,580 --> 01:56:55,800
So they're all this
women among the pylons.

4729
01:56:56,030 --> 01:56:56,863
All right,

4730
01:56:57,120 --> 01:57:00,510
guess who's not going swimming in
that water is Christ that scared?

4731
01:57:00,530 --> 01:57:01,650
I'm not going in that water.

4732
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:02,080
If you had,

4733
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:02,570
if you had,

4734
01:57:02,570 --> 01:57:05,340
if you had to choose one animal to die by,

4735
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:06,090
hmm,

4736
01:57:06,090 --> 01:57:06,923
what would it be?

4737
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:08,730
I would say a big cat.

4738
01:57:08,731 --> 01:57:09,690
Cause they kill you quick.

4739
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:09,931
Yeah.

4740
01:57:09,931 --> 01:57:10,201
Cause they,

4741
01:57:10,201 --> 01:57:11,110
they know where their juggler.

4742
01:57:11,230 --> 01:57:11,400
Yeah.

4743
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:12,300
You would just go out.

4744
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:13,140
I go hamster.

4745
01:57:13,140 --> 01:57:13,621
You go right out.

4746
01:57:13,621 --> 01:57:13,720
It's,

4747
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:17,600
I can show you know bad
ass for Hampshire county.

4748
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:19,250
I asked Chris definitely tie you down.

4749
01:57:19,260 --> 01:57:20,700
Fill the hamster up with steroids.

4750
01:57:21,070 --> 01:57:21,950
Ask Us man,

4751
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:23,310
we're all coming up and crystal Leo goes,

4752
01:57:23,490 --> 01:57:24,323
ants.

4753
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:24,781
I go,

4754
01:57:24,781 --> 01:57:25,051
dude,

4755
01:57:25,051 --> 01:57:25,884
that would be terrible.

4756
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:26,431
I don't care.

4757
01:57:26,431 --> 01:57:27,264
I'm brave.

4758
01:57:28,280 --> 01:57:29,071
He's walked away.

4759
01:57:29,071 --> 01:57:29,551
I was like,

4760
01:57:29,551 --> 01:57:30,450
you fucking asshole.

4761
01:57:30,810 --> 01:57:32,250
But you hear about what ants do.

4762
01:57:32,370 --> 01:57:34,260
One of the things they do
is they kill elephants.

4763
01:57:34,261 --> 01:57:37,500
They climb up the elephant's leg and they
go into his ear and they start eating

4764
01:57:37,501 --> 01:57:38,760
the elephant from the ear,

4765
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:40,280
from the inside of their ear.

4766
01:57:40,300 --> 01:57:41,041
This is what you know,

4767
01:57:41,041 --> 01:57:41,790
I have,

4768
01:57:41,790 --> 01:57:43,740
I have the 10 minute
podcast that I do with,

4769
01:57:43,741 --> 01:57:44,720
well Sasso and crystal.

4770
01:57:44,730 --> 01:57:45,300
Yeah,

4771
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:45,901
you guys want to,

4772
01:57:45,901 --> 01:57:49,530
it's called the 10 minute podcast.com
and this is the kind of Shit we talk

4773
01:57:49,531 --> 01:57:49,710
about.

4774
01:57:49,710 --> 01:57:53,250
We pick a topic like this and we just
fucking talk about it and it's 10 minutes

4775
01:57:53,310 --> 01:57:54,330
and if we don't finish topic,

4776
01:57:54,370 --> 01:57:56,040
the music sounds and we're fucking done.

4777
01:57:56,310 --> 01:57:57,390
The music starts and rate.

4778
01:57:57,450 --> 01:57:57,990
It's great.

4779
01:57:57,990 --> 01:57:58,830
It's been really fun.

4780
01:57:59,070 --> 01:58:00,090
That's a fun thing to do.

4781
01:58:00,091 --> 01:58:01,940
Like on a commute like listened to one.

4782
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:02,440
That's,

4783
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:03,110
that's,

4784
01:58:03,110 --> 01:58:06,150
that's why we've been doing well because
we get together and dwell and I said

4785
01:58:06,151 --> 01:58:07,290
let's do a podcast,

4786
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:11,250
but let's make it only 10
minutes everybody else and
and so that's what we've

4787
01:58:11,251 --> 01:58:13,040
been doing and calling
it 10 minute podcast,

4788
01:58:13,041 --> 01:58:13,301
the smart,

4789
01:58:13,301 --> 01:58:13,840
it's called the,

4790
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:17,010
it's called the 10 minute podcast and
you go to 10 minute podcast.com you can

4791
01:58:17,011 --> 01:58:17,580
download.

4792
01:58:17,580 --> 01:58:17,860
Yeah,

4793
01:58:17,860 --> 01:58:18,780
that's killing it.

4794
01:58:19,140 --> 01:58:20,010
That's a funny idea.

4795
01:58:20,330 --> 01:58:20,740
Yeah.

4796
01:58:20,740 --> 01:58:21,660
But a aunts,

4797
01:58:21,661 --> 01:58:22,170
uh,

4798
01:58:22,170 --> 01:58:25,500
I think answer the number one
killer of any animal in Africa.

4799
01:58:25,740 --> 01:58:26,640
I believe that's true.

4800
01:58:26,820 --> 01:58:27,750
I don't know.

4801
01:58:27,870 --> 01:58:28,860
I don't know that ants,

4802
01:58:28,890 --> 01:58:29,611
there's more,

4803
01:58:29,611 --> 01:58:30,540
and I think mosquitoes,

4804
01:58:31,100 --> 01:58:32,250
malaria from malaria.

4805
01:58:32,430 --> 01:58:35,090
There's more weight per aunt on a,

4806
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:36,620
or a commensurate rate as it,

4807
01:58:36,621 --> 01:58:37,650
as human beings.

4808
01:58:37,770 --> 01:58:39,060
When total body mass,

4809
01:58:39,090 --> 01:58:39,750
I believe it.

4810
01:58:39,750 --> 01:58:40,531
That's insane.

4811
01:58:40,531 --> 01:58:40,860
Yeah.

4812
01:58:40,860 --> 01:58:42,150
Think about how much bigger a person

4813
01:58:42,150 --> 01:58:43,930
is in a fucking aunt and they weigh,

4814
01:58:43,931 --> 01:58:46,450
if you added up all the weight of all
the ants and all the weight of all the

4815
01:58:46,451 --> 01:58:46,841
people,

4816
01:58:46,841 --> 01:58:48,130
it would be basically the same.

4817
01:58:48,131 --> 01:58:48,964
Makes Sense.

4818
01:58:49,450 --> 01:58:51,460
Somebody said something you were
saying about like if you took,

4819
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:52,810
this was really in about,

4820
01:58:52,830 --> 01:58:53,080
uh,

4821
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:53,780
they said,

4822
01:58:53,780 --> 01:58:54,110
uh,

4823
01:58:54,110 --> 01:58:57,430
it's biologist was saying if you
took all the ants and you killed,

4824
01:58:57,700 --> 01:58:58,750
if you killed all the ants on,

4825
01:58:58,780 --> 01:58:59,613
on the planet,

4826
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:00,430
uh,

4827
01:59:00,430 --> 01:59:04,600
life on earth would cease to exist
in about five years as you know it,

4828
01:59:04,690 --> 01:59:07,870
because answer such an integral part
of the ecosystem for a thousand reasons

4829
01:59:07,871 --> 01:59:08,441
that amazing.

4830
01:59:08,441 --> 01:59:11,980
He took all the humans and you
got rid of them on this earth.

4831
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:12,430
Uh,

4832
01:59:12,430 --> 01:59:13,390
life would go on.

4833
01:59:13,420 --> 01:59:17,410
Even just the ecosystem would
be totally intact in five years.

4834
01:59:17,411 --> 01:59:17,680
You know,

4835
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:18,520
it's just kind of an instinct,

4836
01:59:18,521 --> 01:59:22,240
that distinction where how much more
important in some ways ants are to life on

4837
01:59:22,241 --> 01:59:22,660
this planet.

4838
01:59:22,660 --> 01:59:27,520
Then humans are because answer such
an integral part of the ecosystem.

4839
01:59:27,521 --> 01:59:30,820
Whereas human beings are actually
in a lot of ways an intrusion on,

4840
01:59:30,850 --> 01:59:31,270
on,

4841
01:59:31,270 --> 01:59:35,170
on end to constructors and all kinds of
things that that requires sustainable

4842
01:59:35,171 --> 01:59:35,441
life.

4843
01:59:35,441 --> 01:59:39,340
Look what we've done to the environment
as it as it stands just by living this

4844
01:59:39,341 --> 01:59:43,270
inexorable rise of human flesh
pushing and buck and you know,

4845
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:45,710
just because they won't answer,

4846
01:59:45,750 --> 01:59:47,860
answer like a very important part.

4847
01:59:47,861 --> 01:59:50,710
They provide food and aeration
and all kinds of things.

4848
01:59:50,711 --> 01:59:51,370
I don't know what the,

4849
01:59:51,370 --> 01:59:51,641
you know,

4850
01:59:51,641 --> 01:59:52,540
I'm not a biologist,

4851
01:59:52,541 --> 01:59:55,660
but it was just a kind of a really
interesting distinction to think that ants

4852
01:59:55,661 --> 02:00:00,640
and a lot of ways as a whole are way more
important and actually crucial to life

4853
02:00:00,660 --> 02:00:00,970
on,

4854
02:00:00,970 --> 02:00:01,900
on planet earth.

4855
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,130
Whereas human beings,

4856
02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:07,240
if you got rid of every human being life
on planet earth would probably carry on

4857
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:08,291
really,

4858
02:00:08,291 --> 02:00:09,124
really well.

4859
02:00:09,610 --> 02:00:10,443
You know,

4860
02:00:11,180 --> 02:00:11,451
it's,

4861
02:00:11,451 --> 02:00:12,041
it's just a,

4862
02:00:12,041 --> 02:00:13,240
it's kind of a humbling,

4863
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:16,870
it's a humbling kind of concepts
and it's killed 30 people per year.

4864
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:17,830
30 people,

4865
02:00:17,830 --> 02:00:18,760
30 people every year.

4866
02:00:18,910 --> 02:00:19,780
More than weed.

4867
02:00:20,050 --> 02:00:20,740
Well,

4868
02:00:20,740 --> 02:00:21,131
bees,

4869
02:00:21,131 --> 02:00:22,060
I'm sure bees,

4870
02:00:22,430 --> 02:00:23,710
bees kill a lot more people,

4871
02:00:23,711 --> 02:00:24,450
I'm sure.

4872
02:00:24,450 --> 02:00:24,820
Yeah.

4873
02:00:24,820 --> 02:00:28,390
People are allergic to
bees and wasps and things.

4874
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:29,770
People aren't people allergic to

4875
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:32,321
fire ants,

4876
02:00:32,321 --> 02:00:32,950
right.

4877
02:00:32,950 --> 02:00:34,330
Do you know how they in Australia,

4878
02:00:34,331 --> 02:00:34,631
you know,

4879
02:00:34,631 --> 02:00:36,100
they get rid of crocodiles in an area.

4880
02:00:36,101 --> 02:00:36,934
It's a really wild,

4881
02:00:36,940 --> 02:00:37,500
they'll,

4882
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:41,650
they'll just kill a shitload of them in
one area and then crocodiles will avoid

4883
02:00:41,651 --> 02:00:44,170
that area for the next five,

4884
02:00:44,171 --> 02:00:45,010
10 years.

4885
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:45,520
Really?

4886
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:46,870
They can smell the death there.

4887
02:00:46,871 --> 02:00:47,651
They'd even if the,

4888
02:00:47,651 --> 02:00:48,240
when the carcasses,

4889
02:00:48,240 --> 02:00:52,660
a room of when they'll shoot a bunch of
crocodiles in one area and they'll keep

4890
02:00:52,661 --> 02:00:53,081
doing that.

4891
02:00:53,081 --> 02:00:56,230
I don't know for how long and then
crocs will not go to that area.

4892
02:00:56,410 --> 02:01:00,010
How many people do you think hippos
kill every year that they say kills more

4893
02:01:00,011 --> 02:01:01,690
people in Africa than any other animal?

4894
02:01:01,691 --> 02:01:05,310
Because you get in the way of a hippo
in the water and you're fucking done to

4895
02:01:05,320 --> 02:01:05,770
you.

4896
02:01:05,770 --> 02:01:06,850
I don't know,

4897
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,500
but my guess is our,

4898
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:10,600
I'll give you my guest and
then we're going to Google.

4899
02:01:10,601 --> 02:01:12,490
How many people die by
snakebite and India,

4900
02:01:12,491 --> 02:01:14,530
which is about 20,000 from what I heard,

4901
02:01:14,890 --> 02:01:17,560
which is actually an inflated figure
cause a lot of times when you bring your

4902
02:01:17,561 --> 02:01:18,400
wife in a village,

4903
02:01:18,401 --> 02:01:19,420
you've planned it on a snake.

4904
02:01:19,900 --> 02:01:20,470
Um,

4905
02:01:20,470 --> 02:01:21,430
having said that,

4906
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:26,460
I'm going to say that the number of
people in Africa killed by a hippo are up

4907
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:30,970
boards of (500) 200-0900 annually.

4908
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:31,873
What?

4909
02:01:32,370 --> 02:01:33,203
Watts?

4910
02:01:33,680 --> 02:01:34,513
Watts?

4911
02:01:35,180 --> 02:01:35,680
That's the,

4912
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:36,680
that's the main people was killed.

4913
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:40,580
Nine 11 practicals and 900 annually

4914
02:01:41,830 --> 02:01:44,120
are fucked up by hippos.

4915
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:46,040
They're very aggressive,

4916
02:01:46,220 --> 02:01:49,070
unpredictable and have no fear of humans.

4917
02:01:49,190 --> 02:01:54,050
People die most often when they get
between a hippo deep water or between a

4918
02:01:54,051 --> 02:01:55,310
mother and her calf,

4919
02:01:55,790 --> 02:01:58,060
that's a bitch to be in the there.

4920
02:01:58,200 --> 02:01:59,240
They're monstrous.

4921
02:01:59,241 --> 02:02:02,090
They're so huge and they can run faster
than you can and they'll crush you,

4922
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:03,770
they bite you and they'll chase you down,

4923
02:02:03,810 --> 02:02:05,990
the chase you down and they'll
bite your head and kill you.

4924
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:07,610
The bite your whole body in half.

4925
02:02:07,611 --> 02:02:09,320
They by crocodiles in half.

4926
02:02:09,350 --> 02:02:10,610
There's so powerful.

4927
02:02:10,730 --> 02:02:13,220
There's a photo of a
guy running in Africa.

4928
02:02:13,221 --> 02:02:17,080
He's running for clip down the street
and the hippos chasing them and you in

4929
02:02:17,150 --> 02:02:17,983
that photo,

4930
02:02:18,140 --> 02:02:19,220
this poor fuck.

4931
02:02:19,221 --> 02:02:20,120
I don't know what happened to him,

4932
02:02:20,121 --> 02:02:22,880
but you see in that photo what?

4933
02:02:22,881 --> 02:02:24,440
What really is going on?

4934
02:02:24,680 --> 02:02:27,260
You see this monster from a movie?

4935
02:02:27,261 --> 02:02:28,730
It's like from that movie relic.

4936
02:02:28,750 --> 02:02:28,970
Yeah.

4937
02:02:28,970 --> 02:02:29,960
Remember the movie really quick?

4938
02:02:29,961 --> 02:02:30,641
Tom Sizemore.

4939
02:02:30,641 --> 02:02:31,191
It's crazy.

4940
02:02:31,191 --> 02:02:32,024
Monster comes out.

4941
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:33,520
That's so primals like,

4942
02:02:33,521 --> 02:02:33,830
yeah,

4943
02:02:33,830 --> 02:02:34,730
it's so primal.

4944
02:02:34,790 --> 02:02:35,540
Human beings,

4945
02:02:35,540 --> 02:02:39,470
you know it's being eaten for a human
being is actually an instinct with

4946
02:02:39,471 --> 02:02:40,041
children.

4947
02:02:40,041 --> 02:02:42,770
When when you take an infant
and you go in their face,

4948
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:44,450
they'll scream and cry of course,

4949
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:44,991
because?

4950
02:02:44,991 --> 02:02:47,420
Because that's a primal fear for us.

4951
02:02:47,421 --> 02:02:52,421
It goes back to our genetics are 100%
and hippos are about as primal as you can

4952
02:02:52,611 --> 02:02:52,881
get.

4953
02:02:52,881 --> 02:02:55,460
A big stupid giant muscle bound animal.

4954
02:02:55,461 --> 02:02:56,150
That's a rhino.

4955
02:02:56,150 --> 02:02:56,983
So Rhino son.

4956
02:02:57,040 --> 02:02:57,220
Oh,

4957
02:02:57,220 --> 02:02:58,053
it poop.

4958
02:02:58,290 --> 02:02:58,441
Oh,

4959
02:02:58,441 --> 02:02:58,750
there's all,

4960
02:02:58,750 --> 02:02:59,690
that's hilarious.

4961
02:02:59,691 --> 02:03:00,520
Really funny.

4962
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:01,220
Wait,

4963
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:05,090
can you bring up that picture
of the man running from hippo?

4964
02:03:05,091 --> 02:03:05,960
See if you find that.

4965
02:03:07,070 --> 02:03:08,030
That's hilarious.

4966
02:03:08,810 --> 02:03:08,931
Oh,

4967
02:03:08,931 --> 02:03:09,890
that's ace Ventura.

4968
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:11,713
Rhino birth.

4969
02:03:11,750 --> 02:03:11,901
Oh,

4970
02:03:11,901 --> 02:03:12,860
this is so subtly.

4971
02:03:13,340 --> 02:03:15,410
Is this the new waistband
tour or was this the old one?

4972
02:03:15,830 --> 02:03:16,670
Isn't there a new,

4973
02:03:16,671 --> 02:03:18,100
I think going to do a new ace Ventura.

4974
02:03:18,160 --> 02:03:18,950
I had everything.

4975
02:03:18,950 --> 02:03:22,340
You're doing a new dumb and dumber and
they were anchored a new dumb and dumber.

4976
02:03:22,341 --> 02:03:23,174
Right.

4977
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:24,501
What happened to him?

4978
02:03:24,501 --> 02:03:26,540
He kinda got bored of
making movies or Jim Carrey.

4979
02:03:26,550 --> 02:03:27,170
Yeah,

4980
02:03:27,170 --> 02:03:31,400
probably just like overdose
on pussy and money and money.

4981
02:03:31,820 --> 02:03:33,860
Wasn't he banging Jenny
Mccarthy for the longest time?

4982
02:03:34,280 --> 02:03:35,360
That takes a lot of that.

4983
02:03:35,510 --> 02:03:35,930
Yeah.

4984
02:03:35,930 --> 02:03:36,321
Look at that.

4985
02:03:36,321 --> 02:03:36,830
Poor guy.

4986
02:03:36,830 --> 02:03:37,910
Oh my God.

4987
02:03:37,940 --> 02:03:40,850
She's skin is a couple of photos too.

4988
02:03:40,851 --> 02:03:41,780
It's not just this one.

4989
02:03:41,810 --> 02:03:45,020
There's another one where the thing
is actually on the road in the nose.

4990
02:03:45,050 --> 02:03:45,883
Good luck.

4991
02:03:45,890 --> 02:03:46,723
Oh my God.

4992
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:48,340
Look at the size of that.

4993
02:03:48,341 --> 02:03:49,370
The throw some marbles.

4994
02:03:49,610 --> 02:03:51,590
Look at the size of that
thing's fucking head.

4995
02:03:51,591 --> 02:03:52,850
Look up images.

4996
02:03:52,910 --> 02:03:53,450
Yeah.

4997
02:03:53,450 --> 02:03:54,440
The one on the far left,

4998
02:03:54,441 --> 02:03:55,070
Brian.

4999
02:03:55,070 --> 02:03:55,950
Oh look at that.

5000
02:03:56,060 --> 02:03:57,880
My poor.

5001
02:03:57,920 --> 02:03:58,341
Fuck.

5002
02:03:58,341 --> 02:03:59,690
Are you fucking kidding me?

5003
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:03,410
Look at the head on that thing and
look at the guys just in the air.

5004
02:04:03,470 --> 02:04:04,760
He's running so fast.

5005
02:04:04,761 --> 02:04:05,600
He's in the air

5006
02:04:07,890 --> 02:04:09,010
that you're well,

5007
02:04:09,050 --> 02:04:09,883
well you know what?

5008
02:04:09,980 --> 02:04:10,690
Very people,

5009
02:04:10,690 --> 02:04:14,630
few people have ever had to run for
their lives and that's that's you running

5010
02:04:14,631 --> 02:04:15,100
for your life.

5011
02:04:15,100 --> 02:04:15,470
Oh yeah.

5012
02:04:15,470 --> 02:04:17,600
That is legit running for your life.

5013
02:04:17,660 --> 02:04:19,400
The upper left one is terrifying.

5014
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:20,713
That one right there.

5015
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:22,310
Cause it's like he's making the turn.

5016
02:04:22,340 --> 02:04:23,360
Look at the eyes on it.

5017
02:04:23,370 --> 02:04:23,541
All.

5018
02:04:23,541 --> 02:04:24,051
My God,

5019
02:04:24,051 --> 02:04:25,570
it's so close to that poor guy.

5020
02:04:25,571 --> 02:04:27,350
I think he's going to fucking kill him.

5021
02:04:27,800 --> 02:04:28,070
Oh,

5022
02:04:28,070 --> 02:04:30,200
I didn't knock up on it.

5023
02:04:30,201 --> 02:04:31,130
The stupid fuck.

5024
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:33,050
He's a game keeper.

5025
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:33,441
Look,

5026
02:04:33,441 --> 02:04:35,090
he was like walking near it.

5027
02:04:35,150 --> 02:04:35,420
Oh.

5028
02:04:35,420 --> 02:04:36,920
And then all of a sudden
the thing turned on him.

5029
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:38,370
Oh Jesus.

5030
02:04:38,700 --> 02:04:42,390
This is some of the most frightening
photos on the Internet doing that Shit.

5031
02:04:43,410 --> 02:04:44,021
If I see a hippo,

5032
02:04:44,021 --> 02:04:44,401
I'm running.

5033
02:04:44,401 --> 02:04:45,300
It's like when I was down,

5034
02:04:45,301 --> 02:04:45,541
they had,

5035
02:04:45,541 --> 02:04:46,950
they brought on line on set.

5036
02:04:47,190 --> 02:04:48,000
They brought a line.

5037
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,160
Guess who was fucking
hiding in his dressing room?

5038
02:04:50,161 --> 02:04:50,641
Literally.

5039
02:04:50,641 --> 02:04:51,060
I was like,

5040
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:51,870
yeah,

5041
02:04:51,870 --> 02:04:53,700
you don't know how to control a lie in.

5042
02:04:53,701 --> 02:04:57,990
It was a male lion that they modeled
the lion king after 525 pound male line,

5043
02:04:58,320 --> 02:04:58,830
guess what?

5044
02:04:58,830 --> 02:04:59,850
And all the other actors are like,

5045
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:00,001
oh,

5046
02:05:00,001 --> 02:05:00,661
that's so neat.

5047
02:05:00,661 --> 02:05:00,980
Their pet,

5048
02:05:00,980 --> 02:05:01,291
they're like,

5049
02:05:01,291 --> 02:05:01,891
want to pet it?

5050
02:05:01,891 --> 02:05:02,370
And they're like,

5051
02:05:02,370 --> 02:05:02,791
oh yeah,

5052
02:05:02,791 --> 02:05:03,430
he's fine.

5053
02:05:03,430 --> 02:05:04,320
The trainer,

5054
02:05:04,321 --> 02:05:05,760
he's got a ponytail on a fucking,

5055
02:05:05,761 --> 02:05:05,971
you know,

5056
02:05:05,971 --> 02:05:06,870
safari outfit on.

5057
02:05:07,110 --> 02:05:08,280
What the fuck are you going to do?

5058
02:05:08,281 --> 02:05:09,570
And Mr Leone a decides,

5059
02:05:09,630 --> 02:05:09,871
oh,

5060
02:05:09,871 --> 02:05:10,704
your food.

5061
02:05:10,740 --> 02:05:11,573
Nothing.

5062
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:12,221
Oh my God,

5063
02:05:12,221 --> 02:05:13,050
that's so scary.

5064
02:05:13,050 --> 02:05:13,840
I hid.

5065
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:15,270
I had such a scary fucking animal.

5066
02:05:15,320 --> 02:05:16,290
Oh my God.

5067
02:05:16,291 --> 02:05:18,030
And the idea that it could
just snap at any moment.

5068
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:20,070
There's a lot of goddamn youtube videos,

5069
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:20,341
dude,

5070
02:05:20,341 --> 02:05:20,680
I was,

5071
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:22,110
you not go on Youtube.

5072
02:05:22,111 --> 02:05:25,260
Do you not see these animals that are
being held by the trainers and also in the

5073
02:05:25,270 --> 02:05:26,010
just lash out.

5074
02:05:26,010 --> 02:05:27,630
I was in Alaska with my dad.

5075
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:28,980
What does that picture?

5076
02:05:28,981 --> 02:05:29,430
What is this?

5077
02:05:29,430 --> 02:05:30,450
It's given birth to something.

5078
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:30,571
Oh,

5079
02:05:30,571 --> 02:05:31,404
that's a hyphenate.

5080
02:05:31,430 --> 02:05:31,830
Eating,

5081
02:05:31,830 --> 02:05:32,890
eating ass out.

5082
02:05:33,150 --> 02:05:33,983
That's a Hyena.

5083
02:05:33,990 --> 02:05:35,140
Eating a Hyena.

5084
02:05:35,220 --> 02:05:37,410
Eating a hippos asshole.

5085
02:05:37,650 --> 02:05:38,400
That's what it's doing.

5086
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:41,160
Have you ever seen the videos
of lions eating hippos?

5087
02:05:41,250 --> 02:05:43,190
They just climb on them
and start biting on that.

5088
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:47,230
I also saw the video where the hippo
bit the lion in the head and crush it.

5089
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:48,073
Yeah.

5090
02:05:49,230 --> 02:05:50,460
How hungry the lines have to be.

5091
02:05:50,461 --> 02:05:51,570
They really want to eat a hippo.

5092
02:05:51,600 --> 02:05:52,051
Very Hung.

5093
02:05:52,051 --> 02:05:52,801
Tough Times,

5094
02:05:52,801 --> 02:05:53,160
man.

5095
02:05:53,160 --> 02:05:53,491
Yeah,

5096
02:05:53,491 --> 02:05:53,671
man,

5097
02:05:53,671 --> 02:05:54,360
that's not easy.

5098
02:05:54,360 --> 02:05:55,410
Life on the Serengeti.

5099
02:05:56,160 --> 02:05:57,610
People complain about Hollywood.

5100
02:05:57,660 --> 02:05:59,100
People complain about having a job.

5101
02:05:59,250 --> 02:06:00,083
Jesus Christ.

5102
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:00,670
Look at,

5103
02:06:00,670 --> 02:06:03,690
look at what some life farms have
to go through and it's amazing.

5104
02:06:03,691 --> 02:06:04,620
When you look at Africa,

5105
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:05,131
Africa,

5106
02:06:05,131 --> 02:06:09,120
it's always fascinated me because that'll
all the really places on earth where

5107
02:06:09,121 --> 02:06:13,200
there's just an overwhelming
amount of dangerous monsters.

5108
02:06:13,230 --> 02:06:14,063
It's Africa.

5109
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:15,780
I mean Africa has everything.

5110
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:17,250
They have Nile crocodiles,

5111
02:06:17,251 --> 02:06:18,420
they have great white sharks.

5112
02:06:18,421 --> 02:06:19,500
They have lions,

5113
02:06:20,190 --> 02:06:21,120
they have hippos,

5114
02:06:21,121 --> 02:06:22,200
they have hyenas.

5115
02:06:22,770 --> 02:06:23,730
Poisonous snakes.

5116
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:25,330
Austra's a kicking shit out of you.

5117
02:06:25,331 --> 02:06:26,460
You can head right right away.

5118
02:06:26,461 --> 02:06:26,730
Yeah.

5119
02:06:26,730 --> 02:06:27,151
They're mean.

5120
02:06:27,151 --> 02:06:27,720
Cuts to,

5121
02:06:27,720 --> 02:06:28,260
Oh fuck.

5122
02:06:28,260 --> 02:06:29,730
We had them in a set up of your factor.

5123
02:06:30,510 --> 02:06:31,201
He tried to bite you,

5124
02:06:31,201 --> 02:06:31,620
man.

5125
02:06:31,620 --> 02:06:32,660
Dude I was in,

5126
02:06:32,790 --> 02:06:35,190
I was in Indonesia and the rain forest,

5127
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:40,220
they got wasps with like three
abdomens orange for fucking,

5128
02:06:40,681 --> 02:06:43,290
you can see the stingers and
they're just hanging out.

5129
02:06:43,410 --> 02:06:45,690
One got caught in my
sister's hair and you know,

5130
02:06:45,691 --> 02:06:48,630
usually as a brave guy you killed a
wasp that's in your sister's hair.

5131
02:06:48,631 --> 02:06:50,550
I fucking ran for the hills.

5132
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,690
I was like my ending this new wall,

5133
02:06:52,730 --> 02:06:55,680
they discovered it looks like a God damn
science fiction when we know they scare

5134
02:06:55,681 --> 02:06:56,580
the fuck out of me though.

5135
02:06:56,940 --> 02:06:57,451
Pull up,

5136
02:06:57,451 --> 02:06:59,550
pull up new giant wasp.

5137
02:06:59,551 --> 02:07:00,690
Discovered your,

5138
02:07:00,691 --> 02:07:02,490
you'll get well that's
what you get in Indonesia.

5139
02:07:02,491 --> 02:07:04,760
I was playing with a snake
with a stick and beauty.

5140
02:07:04,790 --> 02:07:05,041
God,

5141
02:07:05,041 --> 02:07:05,611
the costs a woman.

5142
02:07:05,611 --> 02:07:06,690
She goes uh,

5143
02:07:06,691 --> 02:07:08,100
at that thing by two young man,

5144
02:07:08,101 --> 02:07:12,630
you'll be dead in a half hour and we're
six hours upstream on a boat from the

5145
02:07:12,631 --> 02:07:13,560
nearest hospital.

5146
02:07:14,340 --> 02:07:15,210
If you Google it,

5147
02:07:15,211 --> 02:07:15,511
Brian,

5148
02:07:15,511 --> 02:07:17,070
there's a crazy photo of one.

5149
02:07:17,071 --> 02:07:18,840
This is as big as the guys hand.

5150
02:07:19,050 --> 02:07:19,261
Yeah,

5151
02:07:19,261 --> 02:07:20,094
I didn't want any.

5152
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:20,611
Yeah,

5153
02:07:20,611 --> 02:07:20,881
Nah,

5154
02:07:20,881 --> 02:07:21,714
no thanks.

5155
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:22,531
Yeah,

5156
02:07:22,531 --> 02:07:23,460
that's gotten manageable.

5157
02:07:23,460 --> 02:07:25,200
So it bites you and it humps things you.

5158
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:25,951
And if you go,

5159
02:07:25,951 --> 02:07:26,970
if you go back Brian,

5160
02:07:26,971 --> 02:07:30,090
to do an image search
is about the death star.

5161
02:07:30,091 --> 02:07:31,010
Scorpion Star,

5162
02:07:31,020 --> 02:07:31,410
Scorpion.

5163
02:07:31,410 --> 02:07:33,000
Look at this size of this fucking thing.

5164
02:07:33,090 --> 02:07:34,800
Why is that in the guy's hand?

5165
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:36,160
Jesus Christ.

5166
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:36,340
Look,

5167
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:37,930
what is he doing with that thing?

5168
02:07:37,960 --> 02:07:39,220
Look at this size.

5169
02:07:39,250 --> 02:07:40,900
That's a Japanese yellow wasp.

5170
02:07:40,901 --> 02:07:42,490
I think a Hornet you mean?

5171
02:07:42,520 --> 02:07:42,820
Yeah,

5172
02:07:42,820 --> 02:07:43,660
that's a Japanese yen.

5173
02:07:44,020 --> 02:07:45,070
If you ever seen the biggest,

5174
02:07:45,071 --> 02:07:45,221
yeah,

5175
02:07:45,221 --> 02:07:45,940
they kill bees.

5176
02:07:45,940 --> 02:07:46,940
They'll kill 30,000 bees.

5177
02:07:46,990 --> 02:07:48,100
A whole high will be coming.

5178
02:07:48,101 --> 02:07:49,270
They just chop a mix of them.

5179
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:50,500
Six of them will buy a kill.

5180
02:07:50,501 --> 02:07:51,241
30,000 bees.

5181
02:07:51,241 --> 02:07:52,510
600 do you know how they killed them?

5182
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:52,910
Yup.

5183
02:07:52,910 --> 02:07:53,710
They surround.

5184
02:07:53,710 --> 02:07:53,801
Oh,

5185
02:07:53,801 --> 02:07:54,634
who are you talking to?

5186
02:07:56,140 --> 02:07:57,190
Finish your sentences.

5187
02:07:57,490 --> 02:07:58,440
You mean when they served?

5188
02:07:58,450 --> 02:08:02,470
They cover them and flap their wings
and they end the wasp dies of heat.

5189
02:08:02,740 --> 02:08:03,790
You might have told me that.

5190
02:08:04,130 --> 02:08:06,290
Well well cause cause
they send a scout in,

5191
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:07,860
the scale goes flying around.

5192
02:08:07,870 --> 02:08:08,170
He goes,

5193
02:08:08,170 --> 02:08:10,600
oh look a hive upbeat.

5194
02:08:10,630 --> 02:08:11,970
Let me drop some sent here,

5195
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:12,940
be right back,

5196
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,050
have a good day.

5197
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:17,800
And they go back and then they
come back with six fucking just,

5198
02:08:18,090 --> 02:08:18,490
it's like,

5199
02:08:18,490 --> 02:08:18,911
it's like,

5200
02:08:18,911 --> 02:08:20,080
it's like all of us hanging out,

5201
02:08:20,081 --> 02:08:24,660
having tea and helicopter gun ships come
in and just go [inaudible] you can do

5202
02:08:24,670 --> 02:08:25,271
like what is that?

5203
02:08:25,271 --> 02:08:25,941
Is that you do,

5204
02:08:25,941 --> 02:08:26,130
do,

5205
02:08:26,130 --> 02:08:26,340
do,

5206
02:08:26,340 --> 02:08:27,300
do you want some more milk in the,

5207
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:29,830
then you get fucking blown.

5208
02:08:29,831 --> 02:08:33,010
And you know what it really would be
like is if we were just hanging out and

5209
02:08:33,011 --> 02:08:34,300
giants came into town,

5210
02:08:34,301 --> 02:08:35,800
just started eating us biting.

5211
02:08:35,801 --> 02:08:38,710
You're hiding your head off and throwing
your body down and grabbing another

5212
02:08:38,711 --> 02:08:38,831
one.

5213
02:08:38,831 --> 02:08:39,091
A budding,

5214
02:08:39,091 --> 02:08:39,970
you're never bored with this.

5215
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:41,920
Do you think they were ever giants?

5216
02:08:42,670 --> 02:08:43,420
I Dunno.

5217
02:08:43,420 --> 02:08:44,170
Is that possible?

5218
02:08:44,170 --> 02:08:45,820
I know I want to and I want to pet giant.

5219
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:47,381
They're very loyal.

5220
02:08:47,381 --> 02:08:48,370
As long as you know for you to meet.

5221
02:08:48,410 --> 02:08:50,620
If you see like movies
with giants in them,

5222
02:08:50,660 --> 02:08:51,161
you gotta wonder,

5223
02:08:51,161 --> 02:08:51,281
like,

5224
02:08:51,281 --> 02:08:53,410
I wonder what the biggest person ever was.

5225
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:53,861
You know,

5226
02:08:53,861 --> 02:08:56,740
Andre the giant was 525 pounds.

5227
02:08:56,770 --> 02:08:57,130
And,

5228
02:08:57,130 --> 02:08:58,270
but I mean like giants,

5229
02:08:58,271 --> 02:08:59,680
I mean like 20 feet tall.

5230
02:08:59,770 --> 02:08:59,951
Well,

5231
02:08:59,951 --> 02:09:02,350
I don't think anatomically
the body can really work,

5232
02:09:02,351 --> 02:09:03,580
but I love this conversation.

5233
02:09:03,581 --> 02:09:04,810
It's my favorite show.

5234
02:09:04,820 --> 02:09:06,580
Look at two guys.

5235
02:09:06,610 --> 02:09:07,241
Oh my God.

5236
02:09:07,241 --> 02:09:07,740
Look at this

5237
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:08,573
running out the,

5238
02:09:12,080 --> 02:09:13,710
that's fucking scary.

5239
02:09:15,560 --> 02:09:16,700
Hit the jeep dude.

5240
02:09:18,300 --> 02:09:20,000
Or these are they really slowing down.

5241
02:09:20,130 --> 02:09:21,140
It made me scared.

5242
02:09:21,200 --> 02:09:22,820
Why are they shutting the engine off ever?

5243
02:09:23,990 --> 02:09:24,823
Excellent.

5244
02:09:27,560 --> 02:09:28,393
Good.

5245
02:09:29,230 --> 02:09:29,541
You know,

5246
02:09:29,541 --> 02:09:31,160
it's really a horrible to watch somebody.

5247
02:09:31,161 --> 02:09:34,070
I must be 12 with that one
with it goes after the lion.

5248
02:09:34,160 --> 02:09:34,870
What is that?

5249
02:09:34,870 --> 02:09:36,290
Lower water as the water buffalo.

5250
02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:40,250
Did you see the one with
the honey badger and a lion?

5251
02:09:41,390 --> 02:09:41,721
Oh yeah.

5252
02:09:41,721 --> 02:09:43,380
Look at these lines to
bring down his hip out.

5253
02:09:43,460 --> 02:09:43,641
Oh,

5254
02:09:43,641 --> 02:09:44,690
this is so crazy.

5255
02:09:45,890 --> 02:09:48,350
I love this song this week

5256
02:09:50,740 --> 02:09:53,930
and this guy's just sitting there in
a fucking truck taking video of it.

5257
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:54,861
Well,

5258
02:09:54,861 --> 02:09:55,101
you know,

5259
02:09:55,101 --> 02:09:58,190
animals a lot of times won't
bother you if whatever man,

5260
02:09:58,670 --> 02:09:59,451
one David Plan,

5261
02:09:59,451 --> 02:10:00,860
if I can get data plan on this thing,

5262
02:10:00,950 --> 02:10:03,710
ask them their show you is a video
of him swimming with great whites.

5263
02:10:04,270 --> 02:10:06,150
That guy is a strange cat man.

5264
02:10:06,390 --> 02:10:09,680
He has a legit record for
like holding your breath,

5265
02:10:09,681 --> 02:10:09,921
right?

5266
02:10:09,921 --> 02:10:10,031
Yeah,

5267
02:10:10,031 --> 02:10:10,221
yeah.

5268
02:10:10,221 --> 02:10:12,380
He's held his breath on
Oprah for 17 minutes.

5269
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:13,610
How is that possible?

5270
02:10:13,660 --> 02:10:15,430
How talks about it on ted.com uh,

5271
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:15,861
there's a,

5272
02:10:15,861 --> 02:10:16,491
there's a great,

5273
02:10:16,491 --> 02:10:18,920
he tried to do it as a trick and realized
he couldn't do it and then he said the

5274
02:10:18,921 --> 02:10:22,700
craziest trick of all is if I really did
it and you started training for it and

5275
02:10:22,701 --> 02:10:22,960
he'd,

5276
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:26,390
he did a 50 minute lecture on ted.com
about how he broke the world record

5277
02:10:26,391 --> 02:10:28,490
holding his breath and
it's fucking amazing.

5278
02:10:28,700 --> 02:10:29,533
You should watch it.

5279
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:30,500
But Jesus Christ,

5280
02:10:30,650 --> 02:10:31,880
he also caught a bullet in his mouth.

5281
02:10:31,910 --> 02:10:32,743
But yeah,

5282
02:10:32,750 --> 02:10:34,040
we a steel cylinder,

5283
02:10:34,041 --> 02:10:34,874
his mouth and I said,

5284
02:10:35,120 --> 02:10:38,510
and he had his buddy bill collusion
actually shoot because bill shoots and he

5285
02:10:38,511 --> 02:10:39,200
just trusted bill.

5286
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:41,510
He didn't move and bill
shot a fucking shot.

5287
02:10:41,511 --> 02:10:42,201
That's funny too.

5288
02:10:42,201 --> 02:10:42,411
Right?

5289
02:10:42,411 --> 02:10:42,951
And it was mouth.

5290
02:10:42,951 --> 02:10:43,710
Do you think it would be,

5291
02:10:43,710 --> 02:10:45,130
it's always been obsessed with like,

5292
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:47,780
like human suffering and
going beyond the physical.

5293
02:10:47,810 --> 02:10:51,860
You think it would be possible for him
to like swallow a oxygen container and

5294
02:10:51,861 --> 02:10:52,820
then have a tube coming?

5295
02:10:52,821 --> 02:10:53,654
He tried.

5296
02:10:54,140 --> 02:10:54,800
He tried,

5297
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:55,220
he tried it.

5298
02:10:55,220 --> 02:10:55,700
He tried it.

5299
02:10:55,700 --> 02:10:57,740
Even when he even tried to get surgically,

5300
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:00,560
tried to get a breathing tube stuff
down its throat that nobody could see.

5301
02:11:00,561 --> 02:11:01,370
It just didn't work.

5302
02:11:01,370 --> 02:11:01,970
You see him,

5303
02:11:01,970 --> 02:11:03,320
you see him on the operating table.

5304
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:03,970
Whoa.

5305
02:11:03,970 --> 02:11:05,990
He's pushed his button operating to what?

5306
02:11:06,020 --> 02:11:06,890
They opened them up.

5307
02:11:07,240 --> 02:11:08,510
Try to put a tube in there and they said,

5308
02:11:08,740 --> 02:11:09,011
go,

5309
02:11:09,011 --> 02:11:14,011
go to ted.com ted dot t d.com and watch
David Blaine just even David Blaine and

5310
02:11:14,841 --> 02:11:16,370
he talks so then it's not a trick.

5311
02:11:17,210 --> 02:11:18,440
That's so crazy.

5312
02:11:18,470 --> 02:11:19,910
He actually held his breath.

5313
02:11:20,180 --> 02:11:22,940
He actually held his breath for 17
months and they do a lot of shit.

5314
02:11:22,941 --> 02:11:23,691
That wasn't a trick.

5315
02:11:23,691 --> 02:11:26,570
Like didn't he like stand in
ice and times square for yes,

5316
02:11:26,571 --> 02:11:30,380
but what bothered David was that when
David would spend all this money and time

5317
02:11:30,381 --> 02:11:34,550
doing a great trick that took him a
year to perfect and it was for like

5318
02:11:34,551 --> 02:11:36,200
entertainment to make people feel good.

5319
02:11:36,200 --> 02:11:36,450
That's it.

5320
02:11:36,450 --> 02:11:36,590
He,

5321
02:11:36,590 --> 02:11:36,981
by the way,

5322
02:11:36,981 --> 02:11:37,641
he didn't take any,

5323
02:11:37,641 --> 02:11:38,870
he doesn't let anybody sponsor him.

5324
02:11:39,080 --> 02:11:40,910
And then he finally the
target sponsor them.

5325
02:11:41,030 --> 02:11:43,610
And only if target gave that
money to underprivileged children,

5326
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:45,050
they could all have a shopping spree.

5327
02:11:45,230 --> 02:11:50,230
So David was actually not making any money
off the shit because he wouldn't like

5328
02:11:50,570 --> 02:11:51,111
he turned,

5329
02:11:51,111 --> 02:11:51,891
I think it was coke Cole,

5330
02:11:51,891 --> 02:11:53,330
I want on the soft drink companies down.

5331
02:11:53,331 --> 02:11:55,580
They wanted to give him
$1 million to do what?

5332
02:11:55,581 --> 02:11:56,750
To promoted to have soda.

5333
02:11:56,751 --> 02:11:57,200
And he said,

5334
02:11:57,200 --> 02:11:57,741
it's bad for you.

5335
02:11:57,741 --> 02:11:58,574
I'm not going to do it.

5336
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:00,150
So he that he,

5337
02:12:00,180 --> 02:12:04,790
you know that he was offered the
believe that Chris Angel did in,

5338
02:12:04,791 --> 02:12:05,630
in Vegas.

5339
02:12:05,690 --> 02:12:06,800
That was his deal.

5340
02:12:07,100 --> 02:12:09,350
They offered him $250 million
to that fucking thing.

5341
02:12:09,500 --> 02:12:10,550
And he said no,

5342
02:12:10,790 --> 02:12:12,080
he didn't want to be a Vegas Act.

5343
02:12:12,440 --> 02:12:13,850
So David is a really,

5344
02:12:13,851 --> 02:12:15,200
David's one of those guys who just,

5345
02:12:15,201 --> 02:12:17,120
he doesn't tell her Vega sack though.

5346
02:12:17,330 --> 02:12:18,163
They're pretty bad.

5347
02:12:18,410 --> 02:12:19,101
They pull it off.

5348
02:12:19,101 --> 02:12:20,030
How do they pull it off?

5349
02:12:20,540 --> 02:12:21,580
He just gave,

5350
02:12:21,680 --> 02:12:23,940
it just shows he doesn't want,

5351
02:12:24,140 --> 02:12:25,250
he also doesn't want to be,

5352
02:12:25,251 --> 02:12:25,730
he's just,

5353
02:12:25,730 --> 02:12:27,500
he's just a really
particular guy that way.

5354
02:12:27,501 --> 02:12:28,131
So what does he do?

5355
02:12:28,131 --> 02:12:30,440
He like puts together specials
and then like what happened?

5356
02:12:30,441 --> 02:12:31,700
What happened was he would do,

5357
02:12:31,701 --> 02:12:32,630
he would do a show,

5358
02:12:33,170 --> 02:12:34,280
he'd spent all his time on it,

5359
02:12:34,490 --> 02:12:36,170
and then Fox would say,

5360
02:12:36,330 --> 02:12:37,070
look at all,

5361
02:12:37,070 --> 02:12:39,710
they'd come out with a special
called behind the magic.

5362
02:12:39,950 --> 02:12:40,461
And they'd say,

5363
02:12:40,461 --> 02:12:41,330
this is how he did it.

5364
02:12:41,331 --> 02:12:42,920
And a lot of times they get it wrong.

5365
02:12:43,010 --> 02:12:44,390
That's not how he did trick.

5366
02:12:44,540 --> 02:12:45,750
That's not how we did it would,

5367
02:12:45,860 --> 02:12:46,730
they would lie,

5368
02:12:46,760 --> 02:12:47,870
they fucking lie.

5369
02:12:47,871 --> 02:12:48,321
And they'd say,

5370
02:12:48,321 --> 02:12:49,490
this is how he did it when David was like,

5371
02:12:49,491 --> 02:12:50,630
that's not how I did it.

5372
02:12:50,660 --> 02:12:51,111
No,

5373
02:12:51,111 --> 02:12:51,830
you're wrong.

5374
02:12:51,830 --> 02:12:52,880
But it would ruin.

5375
02:12:53,090 --> 02:12:54,290
It would ruin the trick.

5376
02:12:54,320 --> 02:12:55,730
It took all the magic out of it.

5377
02:12:55,731 --> 02:12:57,140
It just made him feel bad.

5378
02:12:57,530 --> 02:12:57,831
She's like,

5379
02:12:57,831 --> 02:12:58,131
fucking,

5380
02:12:58,131 --> 02:12:58,611
what are you doing?

5381
02:12:58,611 --> 02:12:59,444
It's like,

5382
02:12:59,600 --> 02:12:59,950
what,

5383
02:12:59,950 --> 02:13:01,040
why is that entertainment?

5384
02:13:01,041 --> 02:13:01,221
You know,

5385
02:13:01,221 --> 02:13:01,701
the whole point.

5386
02:13:01,701 --> 02:13:01,900
It's,

5387
02:13:01,900 --> 02:13:03,020
it's an illusion.

5388
02:13:03,021 --> 02:13:05,480
So that was that when he started
doing these endurance feet.

5389
02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:05,691
Yeah.

5390
02:13:05,691 --> 02:13:07,250
But since I've known him since he was 17,

5391
02:13:07,251 --> 02:13:08,084
he was always,

5392
02:13:08,120 --> 02:13:08,931
always obsessed.

5393
02:13:08,931 --> 02:13:09,081
Yeah.

5394
02:13:09,081 --> 02:13:09,740
He was awesome.

5395
02:13:09,740 --> 02:13:09,950
Yeah.

5396
02:13:09,950 --> 02:13:11,330
He's what he was always obsessed with,

5397
02:13:11,331 --> 02:13:11,691
with,

5398
02:13:11,691 --> 02:13:12,230
um,

5399
02:13:12,230 --> 02:13:13,740
with Houdini and,

5400
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:14,451
and David.

5401
02:13:14,451 --> 02:13:14,871
David,

5402
02:13:14,871 --> 02:13:15,530
uh,

5403
02:13:15,530 --> 02:13:16,490
had a tough childhood,

5404
02:13:16,491 --> 02:13:16,791
you know,

5405
02:13:16,791 --> 02:13:16,911
and,

5406
02:13:16,911 --> 02:13:17,181
and,

5407
02:13:17,181 --> 02:13:18,430
and went through a lot and,

5408
02:13:18,431 --> 02:13:20,300
and I had to learn how to be,

5409
02:13:20,810 --> 02:13:21,740
deal with a lot of,

5410
02:13:21,741 --> 02:13:22,001
uh,

5411
02:13:22,001 --> 02:13:25,120
a lot of things that he
wanted that he didn't get in.

5412
02:13:25,121 --> 02:13:25,731
He had that he was,

5413
02:13:25,731 --> 02:13:26,031
he had a,

5414
02:13:26,031 --> 02:13:27,350
he had to be very stoic growing up,

5415
02:13:27,410 --> 02:13:27,590
you know,

5416
02:13:27,590 --> 02:13:27,981
I don't want it to,

5417
02:13:27,981 --> 02:13:29,330
I don't want to betray
anything cause you know,

5418
02:13:29,331 --> 02:13:30,030
if you get them on there,

5419
02:13:30,030 --> 02:13:30,230
you'll,

5420
02:13:30,230 --> 02:13:31,170
he can talk and say,

5421
02:13:31,171 --> 02:13:31,801
speak his mind.

5422
02:13:31,801 --> 02:13:32,160
But

5423
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:34,620
David did not have an easy trial at all.

5424
02:13:34,950 --> 02:13:37,800
So he holds the record for
holding his breath for 17 minutes.

5425
02:13:38,020 --> 02:13:38,791
What else did he do?

5426
02:13:38,791 --> 02:13:41,610
Did he do something where he stood on
a block of ice for like three days or

5427
02:13:41,611 --> 02:13:42,444
something crazy?

5428
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:43,870
He's always been obsessed by,

5429
02:13:44,410 --> 02:13:45,300
what do they do with,

5430
02:13:45,301 --> 02:13:45,670
uh,

5431
02:13:45,670 --> 02:13:46,040
um,

5432
02:13:46,040 --> 02:13:46,210
I,

5433
02:13:46,210 --> 02:13:46,651
I he,

5434
02:13:46,651 --> 02:13:48,720
he was in a block of ice for how long?

5435
02:13:48,830 --> 02:13:50,460
I think it was like
three days or something,

5436
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:51,160
but I,

5437
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:52,080
that might've been a trek,

5438
02:13:52,081 --> 02:13:52,914
I don't know.

5439
02:13:53,850 --> 02:13:54,870
I would have done is the drug.

5440
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:55,191
Yeah,

5441
02:13:55,191 --> 02:13:56,024
I would imagine.

5442
02:13:56,370 --> 02:13:57,660
Although when I was hanging out with him,

5443
02:13:57,661 --> 02:13:59,970
he was walking around on a tee
shirt in the middle of July,

5444
02:13:59,971 --> 02:14:02,430
I mean February in New York
to get you used to the cold.

5445
02:14:02,850 --> 02:14:03,271
Really?

5446
02:14:03,271 --> 02:14:04,104
Yeah,

5447
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:05,100
to get used to the cold.

5448
02:14:05,101 --> 02:14:10,101
So he was conditioning his body to deal
with extreme hunger and extreme cold

5449
02:14:10,410 --> 02:14:11,011
like he'd goes,

5450
02:14:11,011 --> 02:14:11,940
he does these things.

5451
02:14:12,720 --> 02:14:13,710
I hope when he's here,

5452
02:14:13,711 --> 02:14:14,610
ask him to show you.

5453
02:14:14,611 --> 02:14:15,480
I don't want to give this away,

5454
02:14:15,481 --> 02:14:17,730
but ask him to show you
his great white video.

5455
02:14:17,990 --> 02:14:19,770
Ask them to show you what
he did with great whites.

5456
02:14:19,830 --> 02:14:20,720
Why would he do it?

5457
02:14:20,770 --> 02:14:21,750
Will blow your fucking mind.

5458
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:23,153
It'll blow your mind.

5459
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:25,230
You'll know nobody's really done it.

5460
02:14:26,150 --> 02:14:26,941
He's a weird guy,

5461
02:14:26,941 --> 02:14:27,620
man.

5462
02:14:27,620 --> 02:14:28,890
It's a weird way to make a living.

5463
02:14:28,950 --> 02:14:29,670
Yeah.

5464
02:14:29,670 --> 02:14:30,070
Yeah.

5465
02:14:30,070 --> 02:14:31,060
Holding your breath along.

5466
02:14:31,110 --> 02:14:32,940
He likes going to extremes.

5467
02:14:32,941 --> 02:14:34,800
He's an extreme dude.

5468
02:14:35,460 --> 02:14:35,970
He,

5469
02:14:35,970 --> 02:14:37,110
he's the real deal.

5470
02:14:37,750 --> 02:14:38,120
She does.

5471
02:14:38,120 --> 02:14:38,791
He have any children?

5472
02:14:38,791 --> 02:14:39,624
He called me today.

5473
02:14:39,660 --> 02:14:39,961
I just,

5474
02:14:39,961 --> 02:14:40,980
he just didn't leave me a message.

5475
02:14:41,010 --> 02:14:41,880
Does he have any children?

5476
02:14:42,270 --> 02:14:42,961
He does.

5477
02:14:42,961 --> 02:14:43,860
He has one child.

5478
02:14:43,861 --> 02:14:45,630
Now is this a recent thing?

5479
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:48,270
I wonder if it'll change
how he does these things.

5480
02:14:48,790 --> 02:14:49,623
Um,

5481
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:50,910
he's a very loving guy,

5482
02:14:50,911 --> 02:14:51,240
so

5483
02:14:51,240 --> 02:14:52,440
I wouldn't be surprised if it did.

5484
02:14:52,740 --> 02:14:54,810
You could probably make that kid
disappear if it doesn't work out.

5485
02:14:54,870 --> 02:14:55,620
Exactly.

5486
02:14:55,620 --> 02:14:55,861
No,

5487
02:14:55,861 --> 02:14:56,970
he's a really loving person

5488
02:14:58,480 --> 02:15:01,950
who is in case that a massive block
of ice located in times square,

5489
02:15:02,610 --> 02:15:06,810
lightly dressed and seem to be shivering
even before the blocks of ice shield

5490
02:15:06,811 --> 02:15:07,644
around him,

5491
02:15:07,710 --> 02:15:11,730
a tube supplied them with air and water
while his urine was removed with another

5492
02:15:11,731 --> 02:15:12,240
tube.

5493
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:15,810
He was encased in the
box for over 63 hours.

5494
02:15:15,870 --> 02:15:16,590
There you go.

5495
02:15:16,590 --> 02:15:21,450
63 hours at 42 minutes and 15 seconds
before being removed with chain saws.

5496
02:15:21,930 --> 02:15:25,830
The ice was transparent and resting on
an elevated platform to show that it was

5497
02:15:25,831 --> 02:15:27,540
actually inside the ice the entire time.

5498
02:15:28,020 --> 02:15:28,500
Wow.

5499
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:32,610
CNM confirmed that thousands of people
brave the pouring rain Wednesday to catch

5500
02:15:32,611 --> 02:15:35,190
a glimpse of Blaine as
workers cutaway the ice.

5501
02:15:35,640 --> 02:15:36,210
Wow.

5502
02:15:36,210 --> 02:15:39,600
Thousands of people out there in the rain
watching this guy fucking in a blog of

5503
02:15:39,601 --> 02:15:40,434
ice.

5504
02:15:40,710 --> 02:15:43,380
He removed the ice and
it was obviously days.

5505
02:15:43,950 --> 02:15:44,783
Wow.

5506
02:15:44,910 --> 02:15:45,061
Well,

5507
02:15:45,061 --> 02:15:48,900
this is days and the story in his date
wrapped in blankets taken to the hospital

5508
02:15:48,901 --> 02:15:50,250
immediately because doctors field,

5509
02:15:50,251 --> 02:15:50,521
he might,

5510
02:15:50,521 --> 02:15:51,271
if he feared,

5511
02:15:51,271 --> 02:15:52,470
he might be going into shock.

5512
02:15:53,140 --> 02:15:53,973
Yeah.

5513
02:15:55,150 --> 02:15:55,983
Yup.

5514
02:15:56,750 --> 02:15:57,320
Wow.

5515
02:15:57,320 --> 02:15:58,490
That may or may not have been a trick.

5516
02:15:58,491 --> 02:15:58,941
Who knows?

5517
02:15:58,941 --> 02:16:01,190
But said it took a month before
he was able to walk again.

5518
02:16:01,490 --> 02:16:01,641
Yeah.

5519
02:16:01,641 --> 02:16:02,480
He went through some shit.

5520
02:16:03,470 --> 02:16:04,670
That's so nuts.

5521
02:16:04,671 --> 02:16:07,150
It's got this awesome crucifix
on his back like this,

5522
02:16:07,340 --> 02:16:08,480
this incredible rendition.

5523
02:16:08,481 --> 02:16:11,760
He just has always been obsessed with
that sort of human suffering and that's

5524
02:16:11,790 --> 02:16:14,330
going beyond just that thing.

5525
02:16:14,331 --> 02:16:14,870
You know,

5526
02:16:14,870 --> 02:16:18,710
someone that someone can do something
that you can't do it unless someone's

5527
02:16:18,711 --> 02:16:20,300
willing to do something that you can't do.

5528
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:22,280
Didn't he try to do
something in London though?

5529
02:16:22,281 --> 02:16:23,270
And they started mocking him?

5530
02:16:23,720 --> 02:16:23,961
Yeah.

5531
02:16:23,961 --> 02:16:24,780
He was in a,

5532
02:16:24,780 --> 02:16:25,970
he was suspended in a bridge,

5533
02:16:26,210 --> 02:16:27,530
in a glass case,

5534
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:28,400
uh,

5535
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:31,030
with nothing but for like
14 days or something.

5536
02:16:31,600 --> 02:16:32,470
It was in London,

5537
02:16:32,471 --> 02:16:32,710
right?

5538
02:16:32,710 --> 02:16:33,010
Yeah,

5539
02:16:33,010 --> 02:16:34,780
it was w when Chris Rock was like,

5540
02:16:34,781 --> 02:16:35,980
we've got a trick list magician.

5541
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:39,660
He's living in a box with nothing that's
called the project's motherfucker.

5542
02:16:41,290 --> 02:16:42,340
Come to my neighborhood.

5543
02:16:42,880 --> 02:16:43,650
I show you.

5544
02:16:43,650 --> 02:16:44,710
It is true to,

5545
02:16:44,711 --> 02:16:45,640
it's so ridiculous.

5546
02:16:46,150 --> 02:16:46,990
That's a dumb one.

5547
02:16:47,020 --> 02:16:48,220
I haven't seen Chris in her mind.

5548
02:16:48,250 --> 02:16:49,770
He kind of takes a long hiatus.

5549
02:16:49,900 --> 02:16:51,220
I think you stopped doing standup.

5550
02:16:51,320 --> 02:16:51,770
Really?

5551
02:16:51,770 --> 02:16:52,300
Yeah.

5552
02:16:52,300 --> 02:16:54,860
I think I read something that he
started doing standup for a while.

5553
02:16:55,430 --> 02:16:57,250
He was doing something on Broadway too.

5554
02:16:57,340 --> 02:16:59,290
Maybe he's just really getting
into acting or something.

5555
02:16:59,560 --> 02:16:59,831
Yeah,

5556
02:16:59,831 --> 02:17:01,180
actually it was 20 something I think.

5557
02:17:01,380 --> 02:17:04,180
I think some guys get to a point where
they don't want to do it anymore to

5558
02:17:04,181 --> 02:17:05,070
create two wives.

5559
02:17:05,980 --> 02:17:06,521
Like anything.

5560
02:17:06,521 --> 02:17:07,750
When it loses its mystery,

5561
02:17:07,751 --> 02:17:08,860
when it loses his challenge,

5562
02:17:08,861 --> 02:17:11,920
I find Stanhope incredibly challenging
cause I always try to keep like I'm

5563
02:17:11,921 --> 02:17:12,820
coming out with all the new hour.

5564
02:17:12,821 --> 02:17:14,320
I'm trying to reinvent myself.

5565
02:17:14,410 --> 02:17:15,050
It's,

5566
02:17:15,050 --> 02:17:15,701
it's fun.

5567
02:17:15,701 --> 02:17:16,001
You know?

5568
02:17:16,001 --> 02:17:16,834
It's one of the things.

5569
02:17:16,890 --> 02:17:17,201
Yeah.

5570
02:17:17,201 --> 02:17:18,340
I mean making people laugh.

5571
02:17:18,370 --> 02:17:19,750
It's like the greatest gift of all time.

5572
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:22,150
And you're making yourself
laugh and surprising yourself.

5573
02:17:22,360 --> 02:17:22,631
Yeah.

5574
02:17:22,631 --> 02:17:26,650
And it's like the only reason why I would
ever be a drag to me is the traveling

5575
02:17:26,651 --> 02:17:30,220
or if my health started to fail for some
reason I didn't want to get on planes

5576
02:17:30,221 --> 02:17:33,880
all the time that that I
find traveling difficult.

5577
02:17:33,881 --> 02:17:35,260
The road kind of kicks my ass.

5578
02:17:35,440 --> 02:17:37,270
So great to be able to work around La.

5579
02:17:37,680 --> 02:17:40,600
There's so many clubs around La
between the Improv is like the Improv,

5580
02:17:40,770 --> 02:17:42,620
a great club Ontario,

5581
02:17:42,621 --> 02:17:44,150
a great club and Irvine Greek club.

5582
02:17:44,170 --> 02:17:44,560
Right.

5583
02:17:44,560 --> 02:17:47,140
You know there's comedy and Magic Club
does the Ice House in Pasadena where

5584
02:17:47,141 --> 02:17:47,830
we're always out.

5585
02:17:47,830 --> 02:17:50,350
There's so many great clubs
in La that if you wanted to,

5586
02:17:50,351 --> 02:17:53,320
you could still keep your standup
going and stay around La for awhile.

5587
02:17:53,950 --> 02:17:54,290
You could,

5588
02:17:54,290 --> 02:17:55,840
you could get get shit done.

5589
02:17:56,230 --> 02:17:57,063
You're right.

5590
02:17:57,130 --> 02:17:57,880
It's a fucking,

5591
02:17:57,880 --> 02:17:59,440
the Gideon the planes all the time.

5592
02:17:59,440 --> 02:17:59,711
It's just,

5593
02:17:59,711 --> 02:18:01,210
it's so unhealthy for your body.

5594
02:18:01,390 --> 02:18:02,710
I can't stand traveling.

5595
02:18:02,711 --> 02:18:03,090
I'm playing.

5596
02:18:03,090 --> 02:18:04,180
I fucking hate it.

5597
02:18:04,300 --> 02:18:04,831
It's crazy.

5598
02:18:04,831 --> 02:18:06,700
You know we are going to come
up with better air travel.

5599
02:18:06,940 --> 02:18:09,340
We're still in the 50s because
we can't break the speed.

5600
02:18:09,370 --> 02:18:14,370
You know this the sound barrier cause
we'll crack windows to do with this crazy

5601
02:18:14,531 --> 02:18:16,390
fucking rocket rocket ship.

5602
02:18:16,391 --> 02:18:18,680
The earth like the earth at the you.

5603
02:18:18,940 --> 02:18:19,170
Yeah.

5604
02:18:19,170 --> 02:18:20,230
It come back down real.

5605
02:18:20,231 --> 02:18:22,630
The problem is that's not really
what they're using it for.

5606
02:18:22,640 --> 02:18:25,750
They're using it to be able to fuck
somebody up in New York and 12 minutes.

5607
02:18:25,780 --> 02:18:27,160
That's what the idea is.

5608
02:18:27,460 --> 02:18:28,001
It's not,

5609
02:18:28,001 --> 02:18:29,440
the idea is not for passengers.

5610
02:18:29,441 --> 02:18:32,200
The idea is to be able to fuck somebody
up on the other side of the world.

5611
02:18:32,201 --> 02:18:33,910
It's like immediate precision.

5612
02:18:34,540 --> 02:18:35,260
Crazy.

5613
02:18:35,260 --> 02:18:35,950
It's true.

5614
02:18:35,950 --> 02:18:37,990
Like the drone that got the buddy,

5615
02:18:38,010 --> 02:18:39,340
the drone that I ran,

5616
02:18:39,341 --> 02:18:41,260
his supposedly now back engineered.

5617
02:18:41,470 --> 02:18:46,470
That to me was one of the greatest
moments in my theory that life is just

5618
02:18:46,601 --> 02:18:48,550
theater and it's not really real.

5619
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:50,410
And this is all just a work of fiction.

5620
02:18:50,530 --> 02:18:52,120
When Obama was on TV and said,

5621
02:18:52,121 --> 02:18:56,140
well we asked for it back when
he's talking about the drone.

5622
02:18:56,350 --> 02:18:57,183
Do you remember that?

5623
02:18:57,500 --> 02:18:58,333
Have you seen that?

5624
02:18:58,670 --> 02:18:59,860
You seen him actually say that?

5625
02:19:00,080 --> 02:19:01,420
We asked for the drone back.

5626
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:02,321
Sorry,

5627
02:19:02,321 --> 02:19:06,520
we were spying on you with a fucking
automated Ufo that shoots missiles.

5628
02:19:06,700 --> 02:19:07,091
Exactly.

5629
02:19:07,091 --> 02:19:08,110
But dude,

5630
02:19:08,111 --> 02:19:09,130
I have it bad,

5631
02:19:09,600 --> 02:19:10,301
but on the on,

5632
02:19:10,301 --> 02:19:10,691
on my,

5633
02:19:10,691 --> 02:19:15,160
on my podcast I had this CIA paramilitary
got like a real CIA guy I grew up with

5634
02:19:15,400 --> 02:19:18,860
and he's been in Iraq for a long
time and Afghanistan and stuff and I,

5635
02:19:18,870 --> 02:19:23,500
I fucked the sound up and I hope probably
you can fix it cause I try because I

5636
02:19:23,501 --> 02:19:23,771
want to,

5637
02:19:23,771 --> 02:19:24,581
I want to post it,

5638
02:19:24,581 --> 02:19:25,690
but it the dude,

5639
02:19:25,810 --> 02:19:26,830
Brian's done some magic.

5640
02:19:27,140 --> 02:19:28,040
You got to do some magic

5641
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:28,401
with this guy.

5642
02:19:28,401 --> 02:19:29,234
I'm telling you.

5643
02:19:29,300 --> 02:19:30,530
I was so enlightened.

5644
02:19:30,531 --> 02:19:31,680
Like I follow politics.

5645
02:19:31,940 --> 02:19:35,210
You got to live it while
he just got back from Iraq.

5646
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:36,080
So He's here.

5647
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:36,441
Yeah,

5648
02:19:36,441 --> 02:19:36,861
bring it down.

5649
02:19:36,861 --> 02:19:37,311
And he's not,

5650
02:19:37,311 --> 02:19:37,761
he's not here.

5651
02:19:37,761 --> 02:19:38,810
He's in a,

5652
02:19:38,811 --> 02:19:40,670
I can't really say where he's not.

5653
02:19:40,700 --> 02:19:41,930
You can't get them to come in here.

5654
02:19:42,380 --> 02:19:42,921
I can.

5655
02:19:42,921 --> 02:19:43,671
The next time he comes,

5656
02:19:43,671 --> 02:19:44,301
but he's really,

5657
02:19:44,301 --> 02:19:45,290
he's really hard to get.

5658
02:19:45,291 --> 02:19:46,280
He won't be on camera.

5659
02:19:46,340 --> 02:19:47,173
Well you don't have yeah,

5660
02:19:47,240 --> 02:19:47,470
camera.

5661
02:19:47,470 --> 02:19:48,191
Just do it again.

5662
02:19:48,191 --> 02:19:49,670
And the shadow,

5663
02:19:50,260 --> 02:19:51,093
like a shadow.

5664
02:19:51,110 --> 02:19:53,090
It was such a schooling for me.

5665
02:19:54,230 --> 02:19:56,480
It was such a schooling though for me on,

5666
02:19:56,481 --> 02:19:58,370
on what really goes on.

5667
02:19:58,371 --> 02:19:59,810
How politics really work,

5668
02:19:59,811 --> 02:20:01,250
how countries where we work,

5669
02:20:01,251 --> 02:20:02,510
how we really work.

5670
02:20:02,511 --> 02:20:02,781
Give me a,

5671
02:20:02,781 --> 02:20:03,290
for instance,

5672
02:20:03,290 --> 02:20:04,610
like furniture for instance.

5673
02:20:04,700 --> 02:20:05,171
We,

5674
02:20:05,171 --> 02:20:09,290
we like as far as like any
kind of conspiracy theory,

5675
02:20:09,291 --> 02:20:09,651
he was saying,

5676
02:20:09,651 --> 02:20:09,861
look,

5677
02:20:09,861 --> 02:20:10,340
he goes,

5678
02:20:10,340 --> 02:20:14,360
the way shit works is everybody has
different ideas and it just snowballs.

5679
02:20:14,450 --> 02:20:16,990
Somebody floats the
idea out there that uh,

5680
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:18,140
that Iran,

5681
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:23,000
Iraq is a dangerous threat ultimately to
US national security and they create an

5682
02:20:23,001 --> 02:20:24,920
intellectual argument around it.

5683
02:20:25,400 --> 02:20:29,630
The argument starts to win the day because
a lot of other people get involved in

5684
02:20:29,631 --> 02:20:29,721
it.

5685
02:20:29,721 --> 02:20:31,190
Then there are a lot of
people that disagree with it,

5686
02:20:31,460 --> 02:20:33,560
but what happens is then
people would disagree with it,

5687
02:20:33,561 --> 02:20:35,720
get bullied and shut their fucking mouths.

5688
02:20:35,900 --> 02:20:36,591
And before you know it,

5689
02:20:36,591 --> 02:20:38,930
there's a lot of also private enterprise.

5690
02:20:38,931 --> 02:20:41,810
It's going to make a lot of money off
this stuff and pretty soon before you know

5691
02:20:41,811 --> 02:20:42,110
it,

5692
02:20:42,110 --> 02:20:47,110
there's a company making fucking a hundred
grand just for importing sand to Iraq

5693
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:50,601
and Afghanistan,

5694
02:20:50,601 --> 02:20:54,230
which are deserts for the volleyball
courts on the military basis.

5695
02:20:54,350 --> 02:20:57,830
They're making money and pretty soon the
private sector is making a whole shit

5696
02:20:57,831 --> 02:20:59,330
load of money on this
thing called the Iraq,

5697
02:20:59,950 --> 02:21:00,783
Afghanistan.

5698
02:21:01,090 --> 02:21:02,120
Oh one example.

5699
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:03,300
Oh just one example.

5700
02:21:04,190 --> 02:21:05,740
We're bringing sand.

5701
02:21:06,260 --> 02:21:06,981
Yeah,

5702
02:21:06,981 --> 02:21:11,180
it costs a hundred in one instance for
one quarter cost about a hundred grand to

5703
02:21:11,181 --> 02:21:15,660
bring sand and from Kansas or wherever
from a sand farm in Kansas Fan,

5704
02:21:15,730 --> 02:21:19,220
cause you couldn't find fucking sand
in Iraq for your volleyball course.

5705
02:21:19,370 --> 02:21:20,900
That's how the war effort works.

5706
02:21:21,290 --> 02:21:21,951
It becomes,

5707
02:21:21,951 --> 02:21:25,880
it'd be the business and everything
else becomes immeshed in this massive

5708
02:21:25,970 --> 02:21:26,511
effort.

5709
02:21:26,511 --> 02:21:27,344
So before you know it,

5710
02:21:27,560 --> 02:21:32,360
you've got a shit load of interests
working and making lots of money off this

5711
02:21:32,361 --> 02:21:33,050
conflict.

5712
02:21:33,050 --> 02:21:34,520
Now on top of that,

5713
02:21:34,820 --> 02:21:38,690
you have a situation like Iraq and he
described our relationship with the Middle

5714
02:21:38,690 --> 02:21:42,130
East in Iraq as a dysfunctional
relationship where it was kind of abusive,

5715
02:21:42,131 --> 02:21:42,921
what we were trying to do,

5716
02:21:42,921 --> 02:21:44,840
something we got in there and
two years later we're like,

5717
02:21:44,841 --> 02:21:46,160
we can't cut and run now.

5718
02:21:46,400 --> 02:21:47,001
I asked them,

5719
02:21:47,001 --> 02:21:47,601
I asked him this,

5720
02:21:47,601 --> 02:21:48,170
I said,

5721
02:21:48,170 --> 02:21:48,561
I said,

5722
02:21:48,561 --> 02:21:53,210
do you think that Pakistan knew
that fucking Osama bin Ladin was in,

5723
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:55,370
was in that town of Roi,

5724
02:21:55,400 --> 02:21:56,960
which he had been in by the way,

5725
02:21:57,230 --> 02:21:59,720
six months before they caught him and I,

5726
02:21:59,721 --> 02:22:00,441
and he said,

5727
02:22:00,441 --> 02:22:00,800
fuck.

5728
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:01,161
He said,

5729
02:22:01,161 --> 02:22:01,994
fuck yeah.

5730
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:02,511
I said,

5731
02:22:02,511 --> 02:22:02,871
why?

5732
02:22:02,871 --> 02:22:03,260
He said,

5733
02:22:03,260 --> 02:22:03,591
I said,

5734
02:22:03,591 --> 02:22:04,371
why would they,

5735
02:22:04,371 --> 02:22:05,780
why would they keep them there?

5736
02:22:05,781 --> 02:22:06,591
Why would they protect him?

5737
02:22:06,591 --> 02:22:07,370
He said,

5738
02:22:07,370 --> 02:22:11,810
how many billions of dollars did we did
they get from the u s government for

5739
02:22:11,811 --> 02:22:16,811
free for finding to find Oussama
Avalon and fight the terrorism problem?

5740
02:22:17,750 --> 02:22:21,230
He was sitting a mile away
from their west point.

5741
02:22:21,260 --> 02:22:23,150
You don't think they knew where he was?

5742
02:22:23,450 --> 02:22:24,890
You don't think that
he had been protected?

5743
02:22:25,170 --> 02:22:25,980
That town

5744
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:30,980
that he was in is the vacation spot
for all of the militaries elite.

5745
02:22:31,860 --> 02:22:34,320
It is a beautiful fucking town.

5746
02:22:34,560 --> 02:22:35,520
It's high up.

5747
02:22:35,610 --> 02:22:36,780
Really cool.

5748
02:22:37,650 --> 02:22:39,720
My Buddy said it's some
of the most beautiful,

5749
02:22:39,780 --> 02:22:41,460
majestic scenery he's ever seen.

5750
02:22:41,461 --> 02:22:42,690
He was all through those mountains.

5751
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:42,930
Yeah,

5752
02:22:42,930 --> 02:22:44,830
look pretty amazing when they
shoot the photos of the company.

5753
02:22:44,900 --> 02:22:45,780
You know what's funny about him?

5754
02:22:45,781 --> 02:22:46,051
He said,

5755
02:22:46,051 --> 02:22:47,340
he said when he was in Afghanistan,

5756
02:22:47,341 --> 02:22:48,360
it's a crazy conspiracy.

5757
02:22:48,361 --> 02:22:51,270
Then all those people over there,

5758
02:22:51,271 --> 02:22:52,470
the Pakistani conspiracy,

5759
02:22:52,471 --> 02:22:54,440
they all knew he was there and
they all kept their mouth shut.

5760
02:22:54,441 --> 02:22:59,441
We're making billions of dollars from
wins to to help us find Osama bin Ladin

5761
02:23:01,201 --> 02:23:01,571
and took,

5762
02:23:01,571 --> 02:23:05,160
contain the terrorism
problem in their country.

5763
02:23:05,161 --> 02:23:07,770
So why in the world would you
give up your golden goose,

5764
02:23:07,800 --> 02:23:09,390
your goose that lays the golden eggs?

5765
02:23:09,391 --> 02:23:10,490
Why would you give that Gustaf?

5766
02:23:10,510 --> 02:23:12,990
So how they spread the money around to
keep everybody quiet because there was

5767
02:23:12,991 --> 02:23:15,690
also a bounty on Osama bin Laden's head.

5768
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:15,901
Well,

5769
02:23:15,901 --> 02:23:17,490
$25 million.

5770
02:23:17,550 --> 02:23:19,230
So pair that the fuels,

5771
02:23:19,260 --> 02:23:20,400
but for individuals,

5772
02:23:20,401 --> 02:23:23,460
how was that not like something
worth them stepping out?

5773
02:23:23,461 --> 02:23:23,851
First of all,

5774
02:23:23,851 --> 02:23:24,211
first of all,

5775
02:23:24,211 --> 02:23:25,160
we all knew the,

5776
02:23:25,161 --> 02:23:29,160
our military intelligence elite knew
that that was probably what was going on.

5777
02:23:29,250 --> 02:23:30,580
We knew the signs were ceiling.

5778
02:23:30,660 --> 02:23:31,590
The way we found them,

5779
02:23:31,591 --> 02:23:31,831
you now,

5780
02:23:31,831 --> 02:23:33,570
we found them was through DNA.

5781
02:23:33,780 --> 02:23:35,370
Every time that we would,

5782
02:23:35,371 --> 02:23:36,870
they would take DNA samples,

5783
02:23:36,930 --> 02:23:39,060
they would take DNA samples
from his family members.

5784
02:23:39,540 --> 02:23:40,440
That was one of the ways,

5785
02:23:40,441 --> 02:23:42,540
and they would just track those.

5786
02:23:42,541 --> 02:23:42,661
They,

5787
02:23:42,661 --> 02:23:43,021
they would,

5788
02:23:43,021 --> 02:23:43,550
they would try it.

5789
02:23:43,550 --> 02:23:45,330
They basically they would track,

5790
02:23:45,700 --> 02:23:45,980
um,

5791
02:23:45,980 --> 02:23:46,910
and then the new they had,

5792
02:23:46,911 --> 02:23:50,160
they knew who his courier
was and they basically,

5793
02:23:50,490 --> 02:23:53,400
I believe it's a great story and
I can't remember all the details,

5794
02:23:53,730 --> 02:23:57,870
but when somebody go to the hospital who
was part of that family and they get a

5795
02:23:57,871 --> 02:23:58,980
checkup or something,

5796
02:23:58,981 --> 02:24:01,740
they would take a DNA
sample and they would find,

5797
02:24:01,980 --> 02:24:05,760
and I guess they just kind of
tracked wherever his DNA was,

5798
02:24:05,790 --> 02:24:06,091
you know,

5799
02:24:06,091 --> 02:24:06,481
whatever,

5800
02:24:06,481 --> 02:24:07,650
whoever he was related to,

5801
02:24:07,651 --> 02:24:09,810
they knew he had to be around
relatives of some kind.

5802
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:11,490
And somehow they drew a,

5803
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:11,761
you know,

5804
02:24:11,761 --> 02:24:13,860
they had all these ingenious
ways of actually finding them.

5805
02:24:14,070 --> 02:24:15,630
It's amazing that the Pakistanis,

5806
02:24:15,631 --> 02:24:16,321
if they did have,

5807
02:24:16,321 --> 02:24:20,830
when they were ever to keep that we're
able to keep that secret for so long.

5808
02:24:21,570 --> 02:24:26,570
He was in the town where all the elite
political and military elite vacation,

5809
02:24:27,330 --> 02:24:28,620
they have vacation homes there.

5810
02:24:28,950 --> 02:24:29,970
He was there.

5811
02:24:30,510 --> 02:24:31,830
What a surprise.

5812
02:24:31,831 --> 02:24:32,790
So amazing though.

5813
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:33,601
Of course it is.

5814
02:24:33,601 --> 02:24:37,560
But they are amazing that they were
able to step away from that $25 million

5815
02:24:37,561 --> 02:24:38,850
reward or whatever the hell it was.

5816
02:24:38,880 --> 02:24:39,061
Well,

5817
02:24:39,061 --> 02:24:39,810
because,

5818
02:24:39,810 --> 02:24:41,220
because there was such so much more money,

5819
02:24:41,221 --> 02:24:41,621
it was bright.

5820
02:24:41,621 --> 02:24:43,380
It was 25 billion individuals.

5821
02:24:43,381 --> 02:24:46,620
It wasn't how many do you
think the individuals are
making more than 25 million.

5822
02:24:46,830 --> 02:24:48,480
How does that 25 million spread around?

5823
02:24:48,510 --> 02:24:49,021
First of all,

5824
02:24:49,021 --> 02:24:49,530
first of all,

5825
02:24:49,530 --> 02:24:49,921
if you,

5826
02:24:49,921 --> 02:24:50,610
if you were,

5827
02:24:50,610 --> 02:24:52,320
if you were a guy who gave him up,

5828
02:24:52,350 --> 02:24:53,190
if you are a guy,

5829
02:24:53,490 --> 02:24:54,270
well they found him.

5830
02:24:54,270 --> 02:24:55,710
They found him by his DNA,

5831
02:24:55,740 --> 02:24:56,850
attract them to his career.

5832
02:24:56,851 --> 02:24:58,350
They tracked him to a show for I believe,

5833
02:24:58,351 --> 02:24:58,891
or is a,

5834
02:24:58,891 --> 02:24:59,640
I believe,

5835
02:24:59,640 --> 02:25:00,840
but I don't know how they found them.

5836
02:25:01,230 --> 02:25:03,210
Do you buy the a hundred
percent of the story?

5837
02:25:03,690 --> 02:25:04,830
It seems kind of Wonky.

5838
02:25:04,831 --> 02:25:04,951
Yeah,

5839
02:25:04,951 --> 02:25:05,191
I do.

5840
02:25:05,191 --> 02:25:07,000
Because the reason he
did you borrow the depth.

5841
02:25:07,020 --> 02:25:07,270
See?

5842
02:25:07,270 --> 02:25:07,501
Yeah.

5843
02:25:07,501 --> 02:25:09,960
I buy by all of it and the reason I buy
all of it is there were so many people

5844
02:25:09,961 --> 02:25:11,550
in that room that watched
that shit go down,

5845
02:25:11,640 --> 02:25:13,020
try to keep it a secret in Washington.

5846
02:25:13,050 --> 02:25:14,310
Try impossible.

5847
02:25:14,340 --> 02:25:15,990
Pretty easy to keep a secret in Pakistan.

5848
02:25:15,991 --> 02:25:17,730
So I guess the Pakistanis have better,

5849
02:25:17,810 --> 02:25:19,920
very telegenic government system,

5850
02:25:19,960 --> 02:25:20,820
clannish group.

5851
02:25:21,060 --> 02:25:22,170
Those motherfuckers aren't playing around.

5852
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:22,291
Oh,

5853
02:25:22,291 --> 02:25:23,124
and by the way,

5854
02:25:23,530 --> 02:25:24,190
if you think

5855
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:26,770
there's any profit and giving up where
he is and you're going to give the

5856
02:25:26,771 --> 02:25:27,604
Americans,

5857
02:25:27,760 --> 02:25:30,160
think about the guy who
gets the $25 million,

5858
02:25:30,190 --> 02:25:32,170
you think he's going to be
able to hang out in Pakistan?

5859
02:25:32,171 --> 02:25:34,600
Would that money with
that intelligence service,

5860
02:25:34,660 --> 02:25:35,980
the ISI and the ISS?

5861
02:25:35,981 --> 02:25:37,120
Or we live in Miami though.

5862
02:25:37,121 --> 02:25:38,110
You didn't that kind of fucking,

5863
02:25:38,140 --> 02:25:42,280
you had dead 25 million in
Miami deer and get a nice condo.

5864
02:25:42,310 --> 02:25:43,240
Fucking dad.

5865
02:25:43,241 --> 02:25:44,590
Spend the rest on security.

5866
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:47,160
Hit the clubs every night and you know,

5867
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:48,830
you know what else most people believed.

5868
02:25:48,840 --> 02:25:52,730
Most people knew that you're not
going to get that $25 million the car.

5869
02:25:52,760 --> 02:25:53,593
Are you going to collect it?

5870
02:25:53,700 --> 02:25:54,533
We're going to shoot you in the head.

5871
02:25:54,540 --> 02:25:55,373
Are you going to collect it?

5872
02:25:55,810 --> 02:25:56,291
Here's your money.

5873
02:25:56,291 --> 02:25:56,651
Stupid.

5874
02:25:56,651 --> 02:25:57,640
Why didn't you tell us yesterday?

5875
02:25:57,700 --> 02:25:57,940
Yeah,

5876
02:25:57,940 --> 02:25:59,010
you're not going to save that money.

5877
02:25:59,020 --> 02:25:59,980
Saved American lives.

5878
02:26:00,010 --> 02:26:00,850
Who do I go to and the,

5879
02:26:00,970 --> 02:26:01,540
Ah,

5880
02:26:01,540 --> 02:26:02,270
where's my reward?

5881
02:26:02,270 --> 02:26:03,780
Who would I go to with the
u s government by the way?

5882
02:26:04,090 --> 02:26:04,900
That'd be like,

5883
02:26:04,900 --> 02:26:05,471
see you later.

5884
02:26:05,471 --> 02:26:06,190
Thanks.

5885
02:26:06,190 --> 02:26:10,750
What do you think about the story
that he use someone as a human shield?

5886
02:26:10,751 --> 02:26:12,330
One of his wives or something crazy?

5887
02:26:12,331 --> 02:26:12,490
No,

5888
02:26:12,490 --> 02:26:14,470
I think what happened
properly was that they,

5889
02:26:14,530 --> 02:26:16,420
they were afraid the first fight,

5890
02:26:16,421 --> 02:26:17,830
I think they probably
shoot to kill orders.

5891
02:26:18,040 --> 02:26:19,000
But I also think,

5892
02:26:19,020 --> 02:26:19,190
uh,

5893
02:26:19,190 --> 02:26:21,420
that's all that stuff is all
weighed out and way beforehand.

5894
02:26:21,430 --> 02:26:23,530
But I also think when a seal
team like that comes in,

5895
02:26:23,531 --> 02:26:25,540
probably the danger and the [inaudible],

5896
02:26:25,630 --> 02:26:26,830
the worries that he's got,

5897
02:26:26,850 --> 02:26:27,150
um,

5898
02:26:27,150 --> 02:26:27,490
uh,

5899
02:26:27,490 --> 02:26:28,323
explosives on him,

5900
02:26:28,350 --> 02:26:30,370
he's gonna blow himself up
so you don't take a chance.

5901
02:26:30,371 --> 02:26:32,660
So standard operating procedures
put a bullet in his fucking head.

5902
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:32,891
That's,

5903
02:26:32,891 --> 02:26:33,131
that's,

5904
02:26:33,131 --> 02:26:33,940
that's what I think.

5905
02:26:33,940 --> 02:26:35,080
They don't even try to take them though.

5906
02:26:35,090 --> 02:26:35,471
I don't think,

5907
02:26:35,471 --> 02:26:36,850
I don't think that was ever the idea.

5908
02:26:37,050 --> 02:26:37,320
If,

5909
02:26:37,320 --> 02:26:38,590
if somehow they could take him,

5910
02:26:38,591 --> 02:26:39,281
it would have been maybe,

5911
02:26:39,281 --> 02:26:39,521
you know,

5912
02:26:39,521 --> 02:26:42,430
but there was more profit in
just getting rid of them fucking.

5913
02:26:42,431 --> 02:26:44,320
And what they did is they
took a picture of his face.

5914
02:26:44,620 --> 02:26:47,080
They ran it to that facial
recognition technology.

5915
02:26:47,081 --> 02:26:47,591
They sent,

5916
02:26:47,591 --> 02:26:48,121
took a picture,

5917
02:26:48,121 --> 02:26:50,680
sent it back to the White House they
were after they put a hole in his head.

5918
02:26:50,681 --> 02:26:50,801
Yeah,

5919
02:26:50,801 --> 02:26:51,634
they were all watching it.

5920
02:26:51,640 --> 02:26:56,640
They were all watching it and they
were watching it on a screen by Hillary

5921
02:26:57,340 --> 02:26:57,480
Clinton.

5922
02:26:57,480 --> 02:26:58,313
You can see the picture.

5923
02:26:58,690 --> 02:27:01,390
And then some undid some
faceless CIA guys in the back.

5924
02:27:01,420 --> 02:27:02,370
They didn't show their face,

5925
02:27:02,400 --> 02:27:02,950
but,

5926
02:27:02,950 --> 02:27:03,550
but um,

5927
02:27:03,550 --> 02:27:05,350
they were watching that
it was high stakes.

5928
02:27:05,360 --> 02:27:06,700
Obama had to go away for the weekend.

5929
02:27:06,701 --> 02:27:07,331
They knew where he was.

5930
02:27:07,331 --> 02:27:09,130
He had to go away for the
weekend and he deserves credit.

5931
02:27:09,340 --> 02:27:10,510
He had to go away for the weekend.

5932
02:27:10,511 --> 02:27:13,750
And the decision was the
presidents do we go in,

5933
02:27:13,751 --> 02:27:14,620
we know where he is.

5934
02:27:14,650 --> 02:27:14,981
We did.

5935
02:27:14,981 --> 02:27:16,240
They didn't know it was Osama bin Laden.

5936
02:27:16,510 --> 02:27:20,020
They knew there was a very high value
target there that he knew that one of

5937
02:27:20,021 --> 02:27:24,790
their ace of spades or whatever they call
it was there and it was probably Osama

5938
02:27:24,790 --> 02:27:28,690
bin Ladin and Obama had to go home alone
and make the decision of whether or not

5939
02:27:28,691 --> 02:27:30,240
to risk American lives.

5940
02:27:30,650 --> 02:27:33,340
A bunch of from the bill hooks joke,

5941
02:27:33,341 --> 02:27:36,610
the industrialists in a smoke
filled room stuck in their cigars.

5942
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:38,110
Here's your agenda.

5943
02:27:38,140 --> 02:27:38,920
Yeah.

5944
02:27:38,920 --> 02:27:39,510
Yeah.

5945
02:27:39,510 --> 02:27:41,620
So the problem is the
problem is that great book,

5946
02:27:41,621 --> 02:27:42,401
the Black Swan,

5947
02:27:42,401 --> 02:27:43,480
you can never control anything.

5948
02:27:43,481 --> 02:27:44,314
There's always,

5949
02:27:44,320 --> 02:27:46,930
there's always the unforeseen forces,

5950
02:27:47,020 --> 02:27:47,681
the photo get out.

5951
02:27:47,681 --> 02:27:49,660
You think they leave the
photo of your guts out.

5952
02:27:49,960 --> 02:27:53,800
I think that it's definitely in class
it's classified so it's somewhere though

5953
02:27:53,810 --> 02:27:56,710
still they're holding on to them so
we could somehow or another get out.

5954
02:27:56,770 --> 02:27:56,951
Yeah,

5955
02:27:56,951 --> 02:27:59,340
I thought it was a bit of a mistake and
they said there are going to release the

5956
02:27:59,341 --> 02:27:59,890
eventually.

5957
02:27:59,890 --> 02:28:00,251
Really?

5958
02:28:00,251 --> 02:28:00,491
Yeah.

5959
02:28:00,491 --> 02:28:03,970
I thought it was a bit of a mistake for
conspiracy theorists because I mean,

5960
02:28:03,971 --> 02:28:06,880
because what happens is if you don't
show his body and you bury him and see

5961
02:28:06,881 --> 02:28:08,710
cause nobody else is going to tell
when they're going to release it.

5962
02:28:10,030 --> 02:28:10,211
Uh,

5963
02:28:10,211 --> 02:28:10,510
no.

5964
02:28:10,510 --> 02:28:14,140
When photoshops 16 comes up because
it's going to be like in detectable.

5965
02:28:14,180 --> 02:28:14,350
That's,

5966
02:28:14,350 --> 02:28:14,890
that's right.

5967
02:28:14,890 --> 02:28:16,990
Photoshop 60 is to be the new shit.

5968
02:28:17,290 --> 02:28:17,790
They going to be able,

5969
02:28:17,790 --> 02:28:19,930
it's going to be preinstalled
on your iPhone too.

5970
02:28:19,931 --> 02:28:24,320
That's what we're going to release it
when the reality is when he met the seal

5971
02:28:24,321 --> 02:28:24,970
team six,

5972
02:28:24,970 --> 02:28:26,720
the one that did the job,

5973
02:28:26,900 --> 02:28:29,510
he never asked any of them
who the actual shooter was.

5974
02:28:29,670 --> 02:28:30,410
They,

5975
02:28:30,410 --> 02:28:33,350
they never said it and he just shook all
their hands and thank you mean Obama,

5976
02:28:33,650 --> 02:28:33,951
you said,

5977
02:28:33,951 --> 02:28:34,241
oh sorry,

5978
02:28:34,241 --> 02:28:34,701
I'm sorry.

5979
02:28:34,701 --> 02:28:35,534
I'm sorry.

5980
02:28:35,620 --> 02:28:36,453
I'm sorry.

5981
02:28:36,470 --> 02:28:37,450
Sorry about [inaudible].

5982
02:28:37,530 --> 02:28:38,121
You gonna shoot me.

5983
02:28:38,121 --> 02:28:39,380
Let me just shake all your hands a minute.

5984
02:28:39,470 --> 02:28:39,651
Now.

5985
02:28:39,651 --> 02:28:40,610
Barack Obama actually,

5986
02:28:40,611 --> 02:28:42,800
when he met them and congratulate
them on their mission,

5987
02:28:42,801 --> 02:28:44,150
he never asked any of them.

5988
02:28:44,180 --> 02:28:46,410
He never asked who did the
actual shooter was really,

5989
02:28:46,490 --> 02:28:47,480
and they probably wouldn't tell you.

5990
02:28:47,481 --> 02:28:50,510
I think it's like protocol to go to that
with your grave only they know and all

5991
02:28:50,511 --> 02:28:50,730
that.

5992
02:28:50,730 --> 02:28:51,000
Yeah.

5993
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:51,750
Now when the,

5994
02:28:51,750 --> 02:28:54,360
and then there was the other
big conspiracy theory that
I thought it was pretty

5995
02:28:54,361 --> 02:28:54,810
silly.

5996
02:28:54,810 --> 02:28:55,950
Well there was a crash,

5997
02:28:55,980 --> 02:28:56,431
you know,

5998
02:28:56,431 --> 02:28:57,540
a bunch of seal team,

5999
02:28:57,541 --> 02:28:59,730
six guys died in a helicopter
and they were like,

6000
02:28:59,731 --> 02:29:01,600
this is a cover up because
there was som in line,

6001
02:29:02,190 --> 02:29:03,270
wasn't even the same guys.

6002
02:29:03,440 --> 02:29:03,990
No,

6003
02:29:03,990 --> 02:29:05,010
it wasn't even the same guys.

6004
02:29:05,011 --> 02:29:05,844
And so people like,

6005
02:29:05,850 --> 02:29:09,030
but still conspiracy theories
that really hard to pull off.

6006
02:29:09,031 --> 02:29:10,680
It's really hard to organize all that.

6007
02:29:10,710 --> 02:29:12,510
Well it sounds like that's
not the case in Pakistan.

6008
02:29:12,511 --> 02:29:13,350
It's really interesting.

6009
02:29:13,351 --> 02:29:13,740
You know,

6010
02:29:13,740 --> 02:29:17,220
they had a real legitimate conspiracy
going on in Pakistan for a long period of

6011
02:29:17,221 --> 02:29:17,480
time.

6012
02:29:17,480 --> 02:29:18,450
There was so much conspiracy.

6013
02:29:18,451 --> 02:29:20,790
They just have a very good a
date they're going to control.

6014
02:29:20,791 --> 02:29:21,121
If you,

6015
02:29:21,121 --> 02:29:21,901
if you cross the,

6016
02:29:21,901 --> 02:29:22,441
I had the,

6017
02:29:22,441 --> 02:29:22,921
what is it called,

6018
02:29:22,921 --> 02:29:24,180
the intern mentoring.

6019
02:29:24,400 --> 02:29:25,670
They conspired to campus.

6020
02:29:25,680 --> 02:29:26,513
You can kill you.

6021
02:29:26,730 --> 02:29:28,860
It's amazing though that
they did that for so long.

6022
02:29:28,861 --> 02:29:30,480
How long do you think
he lived in that spot?

6023
02:29:30,880 --> 02:29:31,440
Uh,

6024
02:29:31,440 --> 02:29:33,810
well since 2011 so a long time.

6025
02:29:33,950 --> 02:29:37,020
And what about all those stories
that he was on dialysis then?

6026
02:29:37,021 --> 02:29:37,570
He was gonna,

6027
02:29:37,570 --> 02:29:37,860
you know,

6028
02:29:37,860 --> 02:29:39,360
he'd probably been dead for years.

6029
02:29:39,361 --> 02:29:40,320
This was all horse shit.

6030
02:29:40,440 --> 02:29:41,240
You ever hear those?

6031
02:29:41,240 --> 02:29:41,391
Yeah,

6032
02:29:41,391 --> 02:29:42,410
I knew that I,

6033
02:29:42,520 --> 02:29:43,930
there was a fact that he had to,

6034
02:29:43,931 --> 02:29:44,810
to get dialysis,

6035
02:29:44,811 --> 02:29:45,201
I believe.

6036
02:29:45,201 --> 02:29:47,840
I believe he had an issue with
his kidneys and stuff like that,

6037
02:29:47,841 --> 02:29:49,880
which is one of the ways
they wanted to find him.

6038
02:29:50,130 --> 02:29:50,561
He was,

6039
02:29:50,561 --> 02:29:54,410
I guess was zero Stan for a while
where they said they thought he was,

6040
02:29:54,411 --> 02:29:55,990
he actually had been wow.

6041
02:29:56,030 --> 02:29:59,000
And most of the high ranking military
and intelligence officials would always

6042
02:29:59,001 --> 02:30:01,070
say he's probably somewhere in Pakistan,

6043
02:30:01,220 --> 02:30:02,860
but they thought he wasn't an arrow.

6044
02:30:02,861 --> 02:30:03,260
Odd.

6045
02:30:03,260 --> 02:30:06,770
They didn't expect him to be a
mile away from their west point.

6046
02:30:06,860 --> 02:30:07,551
They didn't expect that.

6047
02:30:07,551 --> 02:30:08,060
They thought he was,

6048
02:30:08,060 --> 02:30:09,330
he was in and was zero Stan,

6049
02:30:09,350 --> 02:30:09,780
that law,

6050
02:30:09,780 --> 02:30:11,030
this region where my buddy,

6051
02:30:11,031 --> 02:30:13,700
who's the CIA guy I actually
talk about on my podcast,

6052
02:30:13,910 --> 02:30:17,050
the dude was in the fucking hills
with a couple of the guys and,

6053
02:30:17,051 --> 02:30:17,281
and,

6054
02:30:17,281 --> 02:30:18,114
and uh,

6055
02:30:18,170 --> 02:30:18,591
I said,

6056
02:30:18,591 --> 02:30:20,000
what happens when you get caught?

6057
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:20,211
He goes,

6058
02:30:20,211 --> 02:30:21,044
you don't get caught dude.

6059
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:21,530
And I said,

6060
02:30:21,530 --> 02:30:22,161
what do you mean?

6061
02:30:22,161 --> 02:30:22,820
He goes,

6062
02:30:22,820 --> 02:30:24,230
you're not letting them catch you.

6063
02:30:24,231 --> 02:30:24,531
I said,

6064
02:30:24,531 --> 02:30:25,580
so what is the alternative?

6065
02:30:25,581 --> 02:30:26,420
Because you've got enough ammo,

6066
02:30:26,440 --> 02:30:28,430
you shoot it and then you
say one bullet for yourself.

6067
02:30:29,240 --> 02:30:30,073
And I went,

6068
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:30,501
I went,

6069
02:30:30,501 --> 02:30:30,951
really?

6070
02:30:30,951 --> 02:30:31,191
He goes,

6071
02:30:31,191 --> 02:30:32,840
you don't want to get
caught by those guys.

6072
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:33,431
The you,

6073
02:30:33,431 --> 02:30:36,500
you don't want to get caught by Afghanis
are those push tunes that will fuck you

6074
02:30:36,501 --> 02:30:37,070
up.

6075
02:30:37,070 --> 02:30:38,120
You shoot yourself.

6076
02:30:38,520 --> 02:30:39,030
I was like,

6077
02:30:39,030 --> 02:30:40,040
that's why my buddy lives.

6078
02:30:40,041 --> 02:30:40,401
And I was like,

6079
02:30:40,401 --> 02:30:41,450
that's living on the edge.

6080
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:42,200
She's,

6081
02:30:42,200 --> 02:30:42,771
he's a real,

6082
02:30:42,771 --> 02:30:43,880
but he's always been the baddest dude.

6083
02:30:43,881 --> 02:30:44,330
I know.

6084
02:30:44,330 --> 02:30:46,190
He's always been the baddest
motherfucker on the piano.

6085
02:30:46,610 --> 02:30:49,250
He's such a bad ass and
you would never know it.

6086
02:30:49,700 --> 02:30:50,121
He's the guy,

6087
02:30:50,121 --> 02:30:52,370
he's to fight for guys
just open up on you.

6088
02:30:52,430 --> 02:30:52,940
Like,

6089
02:30:52,940 --> 02:30:53,330
you know,

6090
02:30:53,330 --> 02:30:54,390
he would fight for guys,

6091
02:30:54,510 --> 02:30:55,160
no problem.

6092
02:30:55,160 --> 02:30:56,330
Why would he do that for marines?

6093
02:30:56,600 --> 02:30:57,321
Take his jacket off.

6094
02:30:57,321 --> 02:30:58,280
I want to fight these guys.

6095
02:30:58,430 --> 02:30:59,400
Fly reason why.

6096
02:30:59,530 --> 02:31:00,250
No,

6097
02:31:00,250 --> 02:31:02,780
you know these fucking guys
are chasing them with my buddy,

6098
02:31:02,781 --> 02:31:03,830
my buddy and he,

6099
02:31:04,160 --> 02:31:05,030
my buddy told me this story.

6100
02:31:05,031 --> 02:31:05,864
He didn't tell me the story.

6101
02:31:06,210 --> 02:31:06,681
My buddy,

6102
02:31:06,681 --> 02:31:08,420
my buddy said he stopped and they were,

6103
02:31:08,450 --> 02:31:09,740
they were running down an alley for guys.

6104
02:31:09,741 --> 02:31:09,981
And he goes,

6105
02:31:09,981 --> 02:31:10,720
I'm going to fight him.

6106
02:31:10,720 --> 02:31:11,301
And my buddy goes,

6107
02:31:11,301 --> 02:31:12,000
what?

6108
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:12,381
And he goes,

6109
02:31:12,381 --> 02:31:12,801
I'm going to fight.

6110
02:31:12,801 --> 02:31:13,790
I want to see if I can find it.

6111
02:31:13,830 --> 02:31:14,271
My buddy goes,

6112
02:31:14,271 --> 02:31:14,961
don't do that dude,

6113
02:31:14,961 --> 02:31:15,621
please don't do that.

6114
02:31:15,621 --> 02:31:15,951
And he goes,

6115
02:31:15,951 --> 02:31:16,101
no,

6116
02:31:16,101 --> 02:31:16,820
I'm going to do it.

6117
02:31:16,820 --> 02:31:18,260
And he took his jacket
off and he fought them.

6118
02:31:19,560 --> 02:31:20,310
Just fucking

6119
02:31:20,310 --> 02:31:21,300
started swinging and kicking.

6120
02:31:21,301 --> 02:31:22,051
But he was a really,

6121
02:31:22,051 --> 02:31:22,441
really,

6122
02:31:22,441 --> 02:31:25,560
really good fighter and could
hit like a heavyweight and uh,

6123
02:31:25,920 --> 02:31:27,210
and fucking did just fine.

6124
02:31:27,330 --> 02:31:27,781
And you know,

6125
02:31:27,781 --> 02:31:27,991
he does,

6126
02:31:27,991 --> 02:31:29,520
but his buddy had to
sit there and fight now.

6127
02:31:29,521 --> 02:31:30,331
But those guys were like,

6128
02:31:30,331 --> 02:31:31,470
why am I getting hit like this?

6129
02:31:31,471 --> 02:31:34,350
Why am I getting fucking kicked and hit
and we'll kick in my head and it was

6130
02:31:35,430 --> 02:31:36,263
pretty wild.

6131
02:31:36,740 --> 02:31:39,460
There's a lot of people out there that
have lived some pretty fucking intense

6132
02:31:39,500 --> 02:31:39,810
life.

6133
02:31:39,810 --> 02:31:40,680
He loved danger.

6134
02:31:40,681 --> 02:31:42,000
He was really good in the violence space.

6135
02:31:42,001 --> 02:31:42,721
This is the way he told me.

6136
02:31:42,721 --> 02:31:43,980
It's the only time he fell alive.

6137
02:31:44,040 --> 02:31:46,800
It's funny when we talk about
like David Blaine like his,

6138
02:31:47,460 --> 02:31:52,460
this desire to try to push the envelope
of what a human being can do with

6139
02:31:52,561 --> 02:31:56,370
holding his breath or with ice or we
had talked about on the podcast for this

6140
02:31:56,371 --> 02:31:59,700
David Goggins guy who was one of those
iron man guys ever seen him before.

6141
02:32:00,090 --> 02:32:01,860
He's got a bunch of videos online,

6142
02:32:01,861 --> 02:32:06,861
but he engages in 48 hour races where
they run for 48 hours straight on a track

6143
02:32:07,890 --> 02:32:09,760
and people monitor human beings.

6144
02:32:09,770 --> 02:32:10,261
I'll track.

6145
02:32:10,261 --> 02:32:12,780
Human beings are the best long
distance animals on the planet.

6146
02:32:12,810 --> 02:32:12,990
Yeah,

6147
02:32:12,990 --> 02:32:13,381
we killed,

6148
02:32:13,381 --> 02:32:14,820
that's how we keep persistence.

6149
02:32:14,821 --> 02:32:17,460
Hunting would kill
certain animals in Africa,

6150
02:32:17,850 --> 02:32:18,720
but you know,

6151
02:32:18,930 --> 02:32:19,351
these,

6152
02:32:19,351 --> 02:32:22,140
these people that are
trying to push the limits,

6153
02:32:22,410 --> 02:32:22,801
you know,

6154
02:32:22,801 --> 02:32:23,550
and they,

6155
02:32:23,550 --> 02:32:25,380
it takes a long time to build up to it.

6156
02:32:25,530 --> 02:32:25,850
I'll go.

6157
02:32:25,850 --> 02:32:29,880
An interesting thing that happens with
a lot of young MMA fighters is they kind

6158
02:32:29,881 --> 02:32:33,780
of underestimate the kind of conditioning
that's required to be a five round

6159
02:32:33,781 --> 02:32:38,781
fighter and how intense and how much is
involved and how long the process is to

6160
02:32:41,071 --> 02:32:46,071
build your body into a body that
can withstand work for 25 minutes.

6161
02:32:46,400 --> 02:32:46,710
You know,

6162
02:32:46,710 --> 02:32:49,110
in an arts that's an e
on anybody's wrestled,

6163
02:32:49,140 --> 02:32:49,711
which I did,

6164
02:32:49,711 --> 02:32:51,600
six minutes is a fucking eternity.

6165
02:32:51,960 --> 02:32:54,930
25 minutes is the craziest thing
I've ever heard of my Saturday.

6166
02:32:54,931 --> 02:32:55,541
It's the,

6167
02:32:55,541 --> 02:32:59,190
the amount of exertion that
your body has to go through.

6168
02:32:59,191 --> 02:33:01,680
It takes a long fucking
time to build up to it.

6169
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:05,970
And a lot of guys suffer from overtraining
in the beginning of their career

6170
02:33:05,971 --> 02:33:10,890
because their body simply not conditioned
to be able to handle that kind of work

6171
02:33:10,891 --> 02:33:11,160
rate.

6172
02:33:11,160 --> 02:33:12,000
It's just not,

6173
02:33:12,210 --> 02:33:12,361
you know,

6174
02:33:12,361 --> 02:33:12,601
there's,

6175
02:33:12,601 --> 02:33:16,530
especially when it comes to like a
lot of kickboxers who'd go into MMA,

6176
02:33:16,680 --> 02:33:20,610
they have no idea how
difficult the wrestling aspect
of it and how much more it

6177
02:33:20,611 --> 02:33:24,060
takes out of you and they almost always
gas when the fights turn into wrestling

6178
02:33:24,061 --> 02:33:24,960
matches initially,

6179
02:33:24,961 --> 02:33:27,240
like a lot of the striking base guys,

6180
02:33:27,241 --> 02:33:30,210
they have the hardest time
developing that wrestling endurance.

6181
02:33:30,600 --> 02:33:31,290
It's so,

6182
02:33:31,290 --> 02:33:32,300
so much tension.

6183
02:33:32,310 --> 02:33:33,870
It shuts full exertion,

6184
02:33:33,871 --> 02:33:34,500
you know?

6185
02:33:34,500 --> 02:33:38,220
I mean people really don't respect MMA
fighters enough as far as the amount of

6186
02:33:38,221 --> 02:33:39,870
discipline that it's required to,

6187
02:33:39,900 --> 02:33:40,380
to,

6188
02:33:40,380 --> 02:33:41,520
to be in condition,

6189
02:33:41,521 --> 02:33:44,430
to fight a full five round MMA
fight or even a three round fight.

6190
02:33:44,550 --> 02:33:44,761
My,

6191
02:33:44,761 --> 02:33:47,730
my experience was with that was
I was on a date in my house.

6192
02:33:47,760 --> 02:33:48,421
I had married,

6193
02:33:48,421 --> 02:33:49,900
I had my two pit bulls piggy,

6194
02:33:50,290 --> 02:33:50,910
I'm sorry,

6195
02:33:50,910 --> 02:33:54,450
Peggy was my pit bull and
Stella was my German shepherd,

6196
02:33:54,451 --> 02:33:55,170
my police,

6197
02:33:55,170 --> 02:33:55,881
German shepherd,

6198
02:33:55,881 --> 02:33:56,130
my,

6199
02:33:56,130 --> 02:33:58,260
my fucking working class,

6200
02:33:58,290 --> 02:33:59,520
German German shepherd,

6201
02:33:59,550 --> 02:34:00,510
a fucking wolf.

6202
02:34:00,870 --> 02:34:01,471
And they got,

6203
02:34:01,471 --> 02:34:03,870
they locked onto each other and I was,

6204
02:34:03,900 --> 02:34:04,651
I wasn't that,

6205
02:34:04,651 --> 02:34:05,160
I didn't want them,

6206
02:34:05,160 --> 02:34:06,750
it was wasn't that I didn't
want him to kill each other.

6207
02:34:06,751 --> 02:34:07,950
I was just seeing vet bills.

6208
02:34:07,951 --> 02:34:10,560
I was just seeing thousand dollars here
because as they were ripping into each

6209
02:34:10,561 --> 02:34:11,790
other and I,

6210
02:34:11,850 --> 02:34:15,690
and I was on my front lawn wrestling with
these two dogs and a choking one out.

6211
02:34:15,691 --> 02:34:18,010
Then the other one would cut
fall and then the other one

6212
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:19,400
would get ahold of the other one.

6213
02:34:19,401 --> 02:34:22,690
And I have to choke that one out and went
back and forth as I'm trying to break

6214
02:34:22,691 --> 02:34:22,961
them up.

6215
02:34:22,961 --> 02:34:25,090
Like I kept choking each one,

6216
02:34:25,120 --> 02:34:27,730
each fucking dog out and I was so furious.

6217
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:31,600
And when my buddy Bob came home and,

6218
02:34:31,601 --> 02:34:31,820
and,

6219
02:34:31,820 --> 02:34:32,970
and jumped off the,

6220
02:34:32,971 --> 02:34:33,291
the,

6221
02:34:33,291 --> 02:34:33,431
the,

6222
02:34:33,431 --> 02:34:34,860
my jumped into the yard and,

6223
02:34:34,861 --> 02:34:39,520
and fucking and jumped on both dogs and
put his knees on both their heads and

6224
02:34:39,521 --> 02:34:40,890
just held him there and,

6225
02:34:40,891 --> 02:34:41,111
and,

6226
02:34:41,111 --> 02:34:43,030
and finally that echo from exhaustion.

6227
02:34:43,390 --> 02:34:44,890
I was so exhausted.

6228
02:34:44,920 --> 02:34:46,090
I don't even know how long I was there.

6229
02:34:46,091 --> 02:34:47,920
I was like 15 minutes
fighting with two dogs.

6230
02:34:48,250 --> 02:34:50,800
I remember crawling up
in the corner in my yard,

6231
02:34:50,801 --> 02:34:55,240
I crawled up in a corner and I was like
breathing like I've never like from

6232
02:34:55,241 --> 02:34:56,230
wrestling all that shit,

6233
02:34:56,231 --> 02:34:57,100
there's no comparison.

6234
02:34:57,101 --> 02:34:57,934
Cause I was literally,

6235
02:34:58,270 --> 02:35:02,170
I was fighting for my life and I was
going and imagine and I was on a date.

6236
02:35:02,170 --> 02:35:02,531
I didn't even,

6237
02:35:02,531 --> 02:35:03,790
I didn't even really
have time to look cool.

6238
02:35:03,791 --> 02:35:06,190
I was going and my hands,

6239
02:35:06,370 --> 02:35:10,450
I didn't realize my own my own hands for
fucking a week after that I had trouble

6240
02:35:10,451 --> 02:35:12,900
closing and opening my hands cause I had,

6241
02:35:12,920 --> 02:35:13,310
I had,

6242
02:35:13,310 --> 02:35:16,900
I like torn all the muscles in my
hands from trying to pull them apart.

6243
02:35:16,901 --> 02:35:19,840
Imagine you weren't even
engaged in combat with them.

6244
02:35:19,841 --> 02:35:20,680
You were trying to stop,

6245
02:35:21,310 --> 02:35:21,811
stop the,

6246
02:35:21,811 --> 02:35:22,330
kill you.

6247
02:35:22,330 --> 02:35:22,780
Well that's,

6248
02:35:22,780 --> 02:35:23,620
that's like this book,

6249
02:35:23,621 --> 02:35:25,870
extreme fear where the woman gets
in a fight with a mountain lion.

6250
02:35:26,140 --> 02:35:29,500
This female mountain lion stalked her
and tried to kill her and she ended up

6251
02:35:29,501 --> 02:35:30,281
just fucking,

6252
02:35:30,281 --> 02:35:30,941
she took this,

6253
02:35:30,941 --> 02:35:31,690
uh,

6254
02:35:31,690 --> 02:35:31,871
like,

6255
02:35:31,871 --> 02:35:32,170
uh,

6256
02:35:32,170 --> 02:35:33,003
some kind of a,

6257
02:35:33,010 --> 02:35:37,090
like a knife for like something and a
spike and was sticking in its eye and she

6258
02:35:37,091 --> 02:35:37,780
just turned,

6259
02:35:37,780 --> 02:35:38,021
she,

6260
02:35:38,021 --> 02:35:40,630
her fear turned a fury and
she started fighting back.

6261
02:35:40,990 --> 02:35:41,501
But you know,

6262
02:35:41,501 --> 02:35:43,780
she was fucking fucked up.

6263
02:35:43,781 --> 02:35:45,220
When you get into a
fight with a real animal.

6264
02:35:45,250 --> 02:35:45,760
Oh yeah.

6265
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:46,730
Especially with mountain line.

6266
02:35:46,731 --> 02:35:47,340
You're done.

6267
02:35:47,340 --> 02:35:47,820
You're so,

6268
02:35:47,820 --> 02:35:48,870
we're so fleshy.

6269
02:35:48,871 --> 02:35:49,830
Your food,

6270
02:35:49,860 --> 02:35:50,790
they're predators.

6271
02:35:50,791 --> 02:35:51,390
Your food.

6272
02:35:51,390 --> 02:35:52,920
Our skin's made a toilet paper.

6273
02:35:52,950 --> 02:35:53,730
That's where there's,

6274
02:35:53,730 --> 02:35:54,640
it was made of leather.

6275
02:35:54,660 --> 02:35:55,200
That's right.

6276
02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:56,400
Like deer have leather.

6277
02:35:56,460 --> 02:35:57,010
That's right.

6278
02:35:57,010 --> 02:35:59,400
Deerskin that's exactly
the right shoes out of it,

6279
02:35:59,401 --> 02:35:59,910
man.

6280
02:35:59,910 --> 02:36:00,990
The skin is so tough.

6281
02:36:01,050 --> 02:36:01,591
You don't make,

6282
02:36:01,591 --> 02:36:03,690
nobody makes skin at a human rights.

6283
02:36:03,720 --> 02:36:04,111
You know,

6284
02:36:04,111 --> 02:36:04,501
Schuman,

6285
02:36:04,501 --> 02:36:05,210
shoes.

6286
02:36:05,210 --> 02:36:05,470
No,

6287
02:36:05,470 --> 02:36:05,610
they,

6288
02:36:05,610 --> 02:36:06,440
they take down,

6289
02:36:06,440 --> 02:36:07,380
they take down elk.

6290
02:36:07,980 --> 02:36:08,680
Go try to bite it.

6291
02:36:08,680 --> 02:36:09,520
But yeah,

6292
02:36:10,440 --> 02:36:12,260
try biting you and elk to down by the,

6293
02:36:12,350 --> 02:36:14,670
the grab it with their claws and
they bite it with their face.

6294
02:36:14,671 --> 02:36:15,150
Yeah,

6295
02:36:15,150 --> 02:36:15,720
that's it.

6296
02:36:15,720 --> 02:36:15,960
Yeah.

6297
02:36:15,960 --> 02:36:16,410
Good luck.

6298
02:36:16,410 --> 02:36:18,720
Good luck measuring up with you'd face.

6299
02:36:19,050 --> 02:36:20,070
That's what I say about great whites.

6300
02:36:20,071 --> 02:36:21,330
I go try biting a seal,

6301
02:36:21,331 --> 02:36:21,840
the death,

6302
02:36:21,840 --> 02:36:23,080
it'll bite it on a flipper and level five.

6303
02:36:23,081 --> 02:36:24,420
I mean I can get the fuck off me

6304
02:36:25,130 --> 02:36:26,350
kid a little.

6305
02:36:26,360 --> 02:36:28,450
That's my argument was up
to those people that are,

6306
02:36:28,451 --> 02:36:30,940
when I lived in Colorado when I was saying
you should kill these fucking things,

6307
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:33,580
and people were so angry at me
after one of them killed my dog.

6308
02:36:33,760 --> 02:36:34,810
That really did happen.

6309
02:36:34,811 --> 02:36:35,621
Like I was telling him like,

6310
02:36:35,621 --> 02:36:37,630
why do you allow mountain
lions stick around?

6311
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:38,051
Well,

6312
02:36:38,051 --> 02:36:38,411
you know,

6313
02:36:38,411 --> 02:36:38,681
hey,

6314
02:36:38,681 --> 02:36:40,990
they're a part of nature
and you know they're,

6315
02:36:40,991 --> 02:36:41,621
they're here too.

6316
02:36:41,621 --> 02:36:41,920
I go,

6317
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:45,280
if there was a guy running around that
could kill a deer with his face and

6318
02:36:45,281 --> 02:36:47,830
occasionally he would eat dogs
when you want him in jail.

6319
02:36:47,890 --> 02:36:48,340
Yeah.

6320
02:36:48,340 --> 02:36:50,200
Well this is way scarier
than a guy that could do it.

6321
02:36:50,201 --> 02:36:50,621
You stupid.

6322
02:36:50,621 --> 02:36:50,891
Fuck,

6323
02:36:50,891 --> 02:36:52,040
this is an animal and they fucking,

6324
02:36:52,070 --> 02:36:53,830
they make a bunch of other
animals just like it.

6325
02:36:53,980 --> 02:36:57,970
And then they live in the woods and they
eat dogs and people to whatever there.

6326
02:36:58,410 --> 02:36:58,531
Yeah,

6327
02:36:58,531 --> 02:37:01,020
they've had I think six to
eight a mountain lion attacks.

6328
02:37:01,021 --> 02:37:01,831
But I love mountain lines.

6329
02:37:01,831 --> 02:37:03,110
It doesn't mean you want
to kill mountain lions.

6330
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:05,010
You've just got to be
aware that where they are,

6331
02:37:05,460 --> 02:37:06,150
you know,

6332
02:37:06,150 --> 02:37:06,600
kill him.

6333
02:37:06,600 --> 02:37:07,433
Light him up.

6334
02:37:07,440 --> 02:37:08,580
Fuck those mountain lions.

6335
02:37:09,100 --> 02:37:10,410
Kill an Apex Predator.

6336
02:37:10,520 --> 02:37:11,550
Gid Rid of him.

6337
02:37:12,240 --> 02:37:12,990
Get him out.

6338
02:37:12,990 --> 02:37:13,801
The joke I did,

6339
02:37:13,801 --> 02:37:16,040
I did it about I like

6340
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:17,090
I'm pro mountain mine.

6341
02:37:17,091 --> 02:37:17,924
You bastard.

6342
02:37:18,040 --> 02:37:21,950
Whoa saying was like the argument that
I got in with a guy and this is actually

6343
02:37:21,951 --> 02:37:22,401
in my act,

6344
02:37:22,401 --> 02:37:23,234
but it is true.

6345
02:37:23,300 --> 02:37:25,940
The Guy told me that we needed them
to keep the deer population down.

6346
02:37:26,190 --> 02:37:26,631
And I said,

6347
02:37:26,631 --> 02:37:29,240
do you know the deer not bulletproof
and they're made out of food.

6348
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:30,981
Stupid.

6349
02:37:30,981 --> 02:37:31,640
Fuck.

6350
02:37:31,640 --> 02:37:33,110
It was a real conversation.

6351
02:37:33,290 --> 02:37:33,561
I was like,

6352
02:37:33,561 --> 02:37:35,060
this is the dumbest conversation ever.

6353
02:37:35,270 --> 02:37:35,860
You need.

6354
02:37:35,860 --> 02:37:38,900
Well wild Munsters running through the
woods to eat up all the extra food and

6355
02:37:38,901 --> 02:37:39,501
interesting thing.

6356
02:37:39,501 --> 02:37:40,700
It's an interesting question cause I,

6357
02:37:40,710 --> 02:37:42,890
I personally think all animals like that,

6358
02:37:42,891 --> 02:37:44,860
like tigers and lions should
all be preserved because they,

6359
02:37:44,870 --> 02:37:46,820
so just for the sake of
how beautiful they are,

6360
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,130
I believe everything in other continents,

6361
02:37:50,240 --> 02:37:51,200
just not where I live.

6362
02:37:51,290 --> 02:37:53,320
Nothing that can swim across
the ocean and Jack You,

6363
02:37:53,321 --> 02:37:57,440
I'm not even big on leopards who like
live like Mexico and they're making it

6364
02:37:57,441 --> 02:37:58,274
across the border.

6365
02:37:58,310 --> 02:37:59,143
The Jaguars,

6366
02:37:59,540 --> 02:38:00,373
Jaguars.

6367
02:38:00,470 --> 02:38:02,840
Jaguars are way more
dangerous than a leopard.

6368
02:38:02,870 --> 02:38:05,360
They're much bigger because
they are not afraid of people.

6369
02:38:05,361 --> 02:38:06,130
They will kill him.

6370
02:38:06,130 --> 02:38:09,350
Bebo they you don't have
a chance against the Jag.

6371
02:38:09,351 --> 02:38:10,250
Not a chance.

6372
02:38:10,340 --> 02:38:14,930
It's a in the Amazon when people take
Iowasca you know that crazy jungle

6373
02:38:15,020 --> 02:38:16,880
intoxicant one of the things,

6374
02:38:16,881 --> 02:38:21,140
the visions that they see is jaguars
like a constant like bunch of chat guars

6375
02:38:21,141 --> 02:38:23,510
like watching them and Jaguars
communicating with them.

6376
02:38:23,511 --> 02:38:27,260
My Buddy told me a story of this guy who
is Cia guy told me a story that in the

6377
02:38:27,261 --> 02:38:28,850
Congo or somewhere in Africa,

6378
02:38:29,270 --> 02:38:30,620
this dude decided he wanted,

6379
02:38:30,630 --> 02:38:31,340
he was like a,

6380
02:38:31,340 --> 02:38:32,270
like an embassy,

6381
02:38:32,300 --> 02:38:32,601
you know,

6382
02:38:32,601 --> 02:38:32,961
guy,

6383
02:38:32,961 --> 02:38:34,820
we're going to just want
to be part of the culture.

6384
02:38:35,180 --> 02:38:39,230
And he went to this African tribe and
he drank some tea that they gave him and

6385
02:38:39,231 --> 02:38:43,820
all of a sudden he fucking
starts hallucinating and
he runs off with his cell

6386
02:38:43,821 --> 02:38:47,750
phone naked and he decided that
they were trying to eat him,

6387
02:38:47,900 --> 02:38:49,220
which I don't know,

6388
02:38:49,250 --> 02:38:49,970
but he goes,

6389
02:38:49,970 --> 02:38:51,260
these people are trying to eat me.

6390
02:38:51,590 --> 02:38:55,070
And they had to send this huge search
in part like a rescue team out to the

6391
02:38:55,071 --> 02:38:59,150
middle of the fucking Congo and track
him down with his cell phone and find

6392
02:38:59,151 --> 02:38:59,250
them.

6393
02:38:59,250 --> 02:39:00,530
It was this massive operation.

6394
02:39:00,531 --> 02:39:01,250
They found him.

6395
02:39:01,250 --> 02:39:03,440
He was eating the shreds by bugs,

6396
02:39:03,620 --> 02:39:05,030
caught up by thorns,

6397
02:39:05,031 --> 02:39:06,170
all fucked up.

6398
02:39:06,171 --> 02:39:06,981
I had to go to the hospital.

6399
02:39:06,981 --> 02:39:08,150
He was there like three days,

6400
02:39:08,180 --> 02:39:10,760
like running through the forest
away from what he thought.

6401
02:39:10,761 --> 02:39:13,550
Were people trying to eat them because
of this fucking hallucinogenic tea.

6402
02:39:13,770 --> 02:39:13,990
I mean,

6403
02:39:13,990 --> 02:39:16,160
well they were probably like
really sweet African people,

6404
02:39:16,161 --> 02:39:16,820
you know,

6405
02:39:16,820 --> 02:39:20,150
who had degrees and sure maybe they were
trying to eat them or maybe they were

6406
02:39:20,151 --> 02:39:21,020
trying to eat him though.

6407
02:39:21,021 --> 02:39:21,854
Who the fuck knows,

6408
02:39:22,550 --> 02:39:25,430
came to grips with the reality
that a lot of people eating,

6409
02:39:25,431 --> 02:39:28,640
people in parts of the world actually
ever meet like Africans in this country.

6410
02:39:28,640 --> 02:39:30,050
They all have like six degrees.

6411
02:39:30,051 --> 02:39:31,490
Like Nigerians find me a judge,

6412
02:39:31,491 --> 02:39:33,110
jury and doesn't have
at least his masters.

6413
02:39:33,550 --> 02:39:34,940
I'm going every single time that he goes.

6414
02:39:34,941 --> 02:39:35,301
Well I,

6415
02:39:35,301 --> 02:39:36,260
I have my,

6416
02:39:36,261 --> 02:39:37,220
my degree in,

6417
02:39:37,221 --> 02:39:37,430
uh,

6418
02:39:37,430 --> 02:39:42,430
in all kinds of things in a mechanical
engineering and my doctorate in,

6419
02:39:42,441 --> 02:39:42,970
uh,

6420
02:39:42,970 --> 02:39:43,791
it's like a fucking,

6421
02:39:43,791 --> 02:39:45,650
I imagine is the whole
world was like Africa.

6422
02:39:46,900 --> 02:39:47,780
Africa is actually,

6423
02:39:47,900 --> 02:39:50,040
I talked to my buddy about Africa who was,

6424
02:39:50,041 --> 02:39:50,570
is the CIA,

6425
02:39:50,570 --> 02:39:50,781
you know,

6426
02:39:50,781 --> 02:39:51,141
the guy,

6427
02:39:51,141 --> 02:39:52,220
I shouldn't even say CIA,

6428
02:39:52,221 --> 02:39:53,120
let's just say he's whatever.

6429
02:39:53,121 --> 02:39:53,601
And he said,

6430
02:39:53,601 --> 02:39:54,350
um,

6431
02:39:54,350 --> 02:39:54,831
he said,

6432
02:39:54,831 --> 02:39:55,160
uh,

6433
02:39:55,160 --> 02:39:58,820
he's really optimistic about Africa and
not optimistic about the Middle East at

6434
02:39:58,830 --> 02:39:58,930
all.

6435
02:39:58,930 --> 02:39:59,450
Really.

6436
02:39:59,450 --> 02:40:01,970
So optimistic about the
progress of Liberia.

6437
02:40:02,030 --> 02:40:06,020
Not about guest very much because
Africa actually in a lot of ways has,

6438
02:40:06,080 --> 02:40:08,660
has come to terms to these
terrible wars with a lot of their,

6439
02:40:08,661 --> 02:40:08,931
their,

6440
02:40:08,931 --> 02:40:10,970
their civil strife there of tribal strife.

6441
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:11,121
It,

6442
02:40:11,121 --> 02:40:11,990
what's the band,

6443
02:40:11,991 --> 02:40:13,040
their mineral issues.

6444
02:40:13,050 --> 02:40:14,070
You know that a lot of these

6445
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:16,050
wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone was,

6446
02:40:16,051 --> 02:40:16,291
was,

6447
02:40:16,291 --> 02:40:18,960
was fighting over resources,

6448
02:40:19,260 --> 02:40:20,093
diamonds,

6449
02:40:20,460 --> 02:40:21,300
the diamond mines,

6450
02:40:21,460 --> 02:40:21,840
uh,

6451
02:40:21,840 --> 02:40:22,320
um,

6452
02:40:22,320 --> 02:40:24,120
and the material in the Congo,

6453
02:40:24,121 --> 02:40:25,500
the material that goes into cell phones,

6454
02:40:25,501 --> 02:40:25,711
that,

6455
02:40:25,711 --> 02:40:25,941
that,

6456
02:40:25,941 --> 02:40:28,320
that's really where
these warring factions,

6457
02:40:28,830 --> 02:40:29,663
um,

6458
02:40:29,850 --> 02:40:30,710
fight over it.

6459
02:40:30,711 --> 02:40:33,360
But also they're solving a lot
of their political problems.

6460
02:40:33,361 --> 02:40:34,081
I mean a lot of these,

6461
02:40:34,081 --> 02:40:37,890
a lot of African states where we're
dictatorships just like in South America.

6462
02:40:37,980 --> 02:40:39,840
So he thinks that they can be worked out,

6463
02:40:39,841 --> 02:40:41,670
but they are being worked out.

6464
02:40:41,671 --> 02:40:46,590
Why not the Middle East but the Middle
East mainly because the Middle East.

6465
02:40:46,710 --> 02:40:48,150
Is there a couple of reasons.

6466
02:40:48,151 --> 02:40:48,871
One is,

6467
02:40:48,871 --> 02:40:50,310
and one of the things he brought
up with very interesting,

6468
02:40:50,311 --> 02:40:55,311
he said the notion that you can separate
Islam from democracy as in you can,

6469
02:40:57,600 --> 02:41:00,300
one of the things the tenants that we
have is the separation of church and

6470
02:41:00,301 --> 02:41:01,134
state.

6471
02:41:01,380 --> 02:41:05,400
The Koran is a blueprint
for how to run a society.

6472
02:41:05,400 --> 02:41:08,010
Even how to manage your
banking laws and things.

6473
02:41:08,220 --> 02:41:13,220
It's very difficult to separate Islam
from an Islam Islam from state run affairs

6474
02:41:15,420 --> 02:41:16,500
traditionally in the Middle East.

6475
02:41:16,501 --> 02:41:20,550
The only way you did do that
was by imposing an iron fist,

6476
02:41:20,580 --> 02:41:22,050
the way Saddam Hussein did,

6477
02:41:22,051 --> 02:41:22,680
the way Eh,

6478
02:41:22,680 --> 02:41:25,140
countless Arab dictators did.

6479
02:41:25,770 --> 02:41:26,190
Um,

6480
02:41:26,190 --> 02:41:27,600
that's one of the issues.

6481
02:41:27,601 --> 02:41:32,601
But the other issue is the
Sunni Shia rivalries that,

6482
02:41:32,880 --> 02:41:34,140
that are constantly,

6483
02:41:34,170 --> 02:41:34,560
you know,

6484
02:41:34,560 --> 02:41:38,660
playing out now in not just
in Bahrain but in Syria and,

6485
02:41:38,740 --> 02:41:40,770
and a lot of different
parts and certainly in Iraq.

6486
02:41:41,580 --> 02:41:45,930
And the only way to control that is
one side's got to have more guns in the

6487
02:41:45,931 --> 02:41:46,764
other side.

6488
02:41:46,920 --> 02:41:49,260
And I have a different
point of view by the way,

6489
02:41:49,261 --> 02:41:53,970
but which is that I think commerce
ultimately when commerce comes to these

6490
02:41:53,971 --> 02:41:55,230
countries in which it is,

6491
02:41:55,470 --> 02:41:57,330
I think people are going
to have a lot more to lose.

6492
02:41:57,330 --> 02:41:58,650
I think economic,

6493
02:41:59,790 --> 02:42:01,170
economic prosperity,

6494
02:42:01,171 --> 02:42:03,540
we economic prosperity and
quality and technology,

6495
02:42:03,541 --> 02:42:04,374
I hope.

6496
02:42:04,380 --> 02:42:07,110
I hope for the Middle East is going to
make it a better place to live for the

6497
02:42:07,111 --> 02:42:07,944
people there.

6498
02:42:08,100 --> 02:42:08,520
But,

6499
02:42:08,520 --> 02:42:09,353
um,

6500
02:42:09,360 --> 02:42:11,130
but I do think that if you look at,

6501
02:42:11,131 --> 02:42:11,700
for example,

6502
02:42:11,700 --> 02:42:12,540
Egypt now,

6503
02:42:12,900 --> 02:42:13,800
Egypt has,

6504
02:42:13,801 --> 02:42:15,840
if you look at who's running for election,

6505
02:42:15,870 --> 02:42:20,870
they have essentially hardline
Islamicists who are going to impose,

6506
02:42:21,720 --> 02:42:22,470
you know,

6507
02:42:22,470 --> 02:42:23,020
or the,

6508
02:42:23,020 --> 02:42:23,161
the,

6509
02:42:23,161 --> 02:42:27,030
the worry is that they're going to
impose real well Shiria or something like

6510
02:42:27,031 --> 02:42:27,271
that.

6511
02:42:27,271 --> 02:42:28,890
That's certainly not very democratic.

6512
02:42:29,480 --> 02:42:29,820
Uh,

6513
02:42:29,820 --> 02:42:30,540
so,

6514
02:42:30,540 --> 02:42:30,901
you know,

6515
02:42:30,901 --> 02:42:32,670
but did you want to go
back to them a barks,

6516
02:42:32,671 --> 02:42:32,971
rain?

6517
02:42:32,971 --> 02:42:34,050
How did those dictators,

6518
02:42:34,140 --> 02:42:35,220
how's that going to be stopped?

6519
02:42:35,270 --> 02:42:36,960
You think it's only money
that's gonna be able to stop?

6520
02:42:37,010 --> 02:42:37,681
I think,

6521
02:42:37,681 --> 02:42:39,960
I think what happens with all countries,

6522
02:42:39,990 --> 02:42:40,440
it's,

6523
02:42:40,440 --> 02:42:40,870
look,

6524
02:42:40,870 --> 02:42:41,281
you know,

6525
02:42:41,281 --> 02:42:42,330
how to stop at time.

6526
02:42:42,480 --> 02:42:44,880
What happens is take a look
at what happened in Europe.

6527
02:42:44,880 --> 02:42:46,650
Take a look at what happened
when Central America,

6528
02:42:46,890 --> 02:42:48,570
these are democracies,

6529
02:42:48,600 --> 02:42:49,740
imperfect democracies,

6530
02:42:49,741 --> 02:42:52,350
but there's certainly not
military dictatorships.

6531
02:42:52,351 --> 02:42:53,720
You think there's a real shy,

6532
02:42:53,860 --> 02:42:54,780
even in China,

6533
02:42:54,870 --> 02:42:55,770
even in China,

6534
02:42:56,130 --> 02:43:01,020
China is learning that basically
democracy is an inevitable,

6535
02:43:01,380 --> 02:43:04,530
inevitable thing that they
have to come to terms with.

6536
02:43:04,531 --> 02:43:05,550
And when I say democracy,

6537
02:43:05,551 --> 02:43:08,670
I mean a government that
listens to its people.

6538
02:43:08,980 --> 02:43:09,600
It.

6539
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:10,650
How do you keep,

6540
02:43:10,680 --> 02:43:11,140
uh,

6541
02:43:11,140 --> 02:43:12,160
people in,

6542
02:43:12,161 --> 02:43:13,120
in ignorance?

6543
02:43:13,390 --> 02:43:15,790
How do you keep people ignorant when
they have access to the Internet?

6544
02:43:15,820 --> 02:43:16,653
You don't.

6545
02:43:16,870 --> 02:43:21,790
Human beings now have access to real
information and the truth of what's really

6546
02:43:21,791 --> 02:43:22,211
going on,

6547
02:43:22,211 --> 02:43:22,991
and more importantly,

6548
02:43:22,991 --> 02:43:24,550
they can see how other
countries are living.

6549
02:43:24,760 --> 02:43:29,760
It's very difficult to control and have
power over a people when they know the

6550
02:43:30,401 --> 02:43:31,060
truth.

6551
02:43:31,060 --> 02:43:34,120
And one of the most unique things about
what's going on in the Middle East today

6552
02:43:34,300 --> 02:43:39,300
is that these uprisings are uprisings
that are happening organically from within

6553
02:43:39,760 --> 02:43:40,750
the population.

6554
02:43:40,780 --> 02:43:44,200
They are not being manipulated
by an p an imperialistic power.

6555
02:43:44,440 --> 02:43:45,880
They're not being manipulated by,

6556
02:43:45,970 --> 02:43:47,440
by another Arab country.

6557
02:43:47,590 --> 02:43:48,750
These are homegrown,

6558
02:43:48,910 --> 02:43:53,910
grassroots rebellions that
are very difficult to,

6559
02:43:54,490 --> 02:43:55,780
to ignore.

6560
02:43:56,020 --> 02:44:00,580
And the people that are doing it are
young people who just want a better life.

6561
02:44:00,700 --> 02:44:03,190
And I can tell you right now
that if these theocracies,

6562
02:44:03,191 --> 02:44:04,060
if they vote in these,

6563
02:44:04,061 --> 02:44:04,331
these,

6564
02:44:04,331 --> 02:44:07,630
these Islamicists and
they don't see results,

6565
02:44:07,631 --> 02:44:08,980
you're gonna see more rebellion.

6566
02:44:09,370 --> 02:44:13,990
And so I think that that whether or
not these countries are Islamised,

6567
02:44:14,110 --> 02:44:16,450
they're going to have to listen to their
populations and they're going to have

6568
02:44:16,451 --> 02:44:17,110
to be,

6569
02:44:17,110 --> 02:44:19,000
they're going to have to
respect individual freedoms.

6570
02:44:19,001 --> 02:44:19,811
That's my belief.

6571
02:44:19,811 --> 02:44:20,950
That's my hope anyway.

6572
02:44:21,520 --> 02:44:22,480
I may be naive.

6573
02:44:22,660 --> 02:44:22,960
Yeah.

6574
02:44:22,960 --> 02:44:23,620
Wow.

6575
02:44:23,620 --> 02:44:24,453
Good Hope.

6576
02:44:24,780 --> 02:44:25,613
I hope so.

6577
02:44:25,620 --> 02:44:28,440
[inaudible] a beautiful idea that
eventually we're all going to come to some

6578
02:44:28,441 --> 02:44:32,160
sort of a utopian sense system of
government that we're all going to accept

6579
02:44:32,161 --> 02:44:33,690
because it's all going to
be the will of the people.

6580
02:44:34,030 --> 02:44:37,780
It's just the will of the people in this
country is slowly being choked and the,

6581
02:44:37,781 --> 02:44:38,071
the,

6582
02:44:38,071 --> 02:44:38,821
all the,

6583
02:44:38,821 --> 02:44:42,870
the provisions provided by the
constitution are slowly being choked out.

6584
02:44:43,110 --> 02:44:44,370
I agree with you in government.

6585
02:44:44,400 --> 02:44:45,050
That's scary.

6586
02:44:45,050 --> 02:44:45,661
The biggest,

6587
02:44:45,661 --> 02:44:48,240
the biggest problem is I think
a lot of government governments,

6588
02:44:48,250 --> 02:44:50,070
and I'm talking about
municipal governments,

6589
02:44:50,071 --> 02:44:50,731
state governments,

6590
02:44:50,731 --> 02:44:51,180
well,

6591
02:44:51,180 --> 02:44:53,460
they're becoming more
concerned with their own,

6592
02:44:53,490 --> 02:44:56,070
with their own employees and the
people that they're trying to serve.

6593
02:44:56,100 --> 02:44:57,330
They want to keep jobs going,

6594
02:44:57,331 --> 02:44:58,740
so they want to keep laws in place.

6595
02:44:59,130 --> 02:45:01,230
If there's no one to arrest for anything,

6596
02:45:01,231 --> 02:45:02,760
then there's no need for that job.

6597
02:45:02,820 --> 02:45:04,590
What's happening to
the people and the DEA.

6598
02:45:04,591 --> 02:45:08,970
A lot of people in drug enforcement that
are actively lobbying to keep certain

6599
02:45:09,150 --> 02:45:13,410
really nonlethal non-dangerous drugs and
keep them illegal because they want to

6600
02:45:13,411 --> 02:45:14,520
have people to rest for things.

6601
02:45:14,730 --> 02:45:17,280
There's only of the problem with
private prisons and you have the PR,

6602
02:45:17,310 --> 02:45:18,780
there's so many different fucking

6603
02:45:18,820 --> 02:45:19,600
problems.

6604
02:45:19,600 --> 02:45:19,990
Well,

6605
02:45:19,990 --> 02:45:22,450
well it's anytime somebody has
a vested interest in something,

6606
02:45:22,451 --> 02:45:25,230
they're going to try to protect that
interest and regardless of whether they're

6607
02:45:25,240 --> 02:45:26,410
a good person or a bad person,

6608
02:45:26,411 --> 02:45:28,240
we have a vested interest in marijuana.

6609
02:45:28,420 --> 02:45:29,150
That's right.

6610
02:45:29,150 --> 02:45:30,580
We're trying to protect the marijuana.

6611
02:45:30,740 --> 02:45:31,420
I um,

6612
02:45:31,420 --> 02:45:33,540
I'm going to have to run soon.

6613
02:45:33,541 --> 02:45:34,570
I have to close this thing down.

6614
02:45:35,160 --> 02:45:35,993
Let's shut it off.

6615
02:45:36,580 --> 02:45:37,181
Once again,

6616
02:45:37,181 --> 02:45:37,811
my dear friend,

6617
02:45:37,811 --> 02:45:38,644
thanks for having me.

6618
02:45:39,270 --> 02:45:44,270
D driven sort of a conversation
until all sorts of bizarre subjects.

6619
02:45:44,450 --> 02:45:44,801
I love it,

6620
02:45:44,801 --> 02:45:44,951
man.

6621
02:45:44,951 --> 02:45:45,090
Man,

6622
02:45:45,090 --> 02:45:45,481
I never,

6623
02:45:45,481 --> 02:45:46,440
I never have a bad time.

6624
02:45:46,441 --> 02:45:47,274
It's always enlightening.

6625
02:45:47,520 --> 02:45:51,210
Make sure you check out Brian [inaudible].

6626
02:45:51,570 --> 02:45:52,830
Brian Callahan has,

6627
02:45:52,910 --> 02:45:54,780
what do you call the bank account show?

6628
02:45:54,840 --> 02:45:55,673
Perfect name.

6629
02:45:56,220 --> 02:45:57,090
Couldn't be any better.

6630
02:45:57,110 --> 02:45:59,110
I'm feel pretentious with
the Joe Rogan experience.

6631
02:45:59,140 --> 02:46:00,150
Got Some great guests.

6632
02:46:00,340 --> 02:46:01,470
My Sam Brown,

6633
02:46:01,471 --> 02:46:02,580
my buddy's dying of cancer.

6634
02:46:03,030 --> 02:46:03,631
I mean not dying.

6635
02:46:03,631 --> 02:46:04,031
I don't want to say it,

6636
02:46:04,031 --> 02:46:05,550
but he's fucking hilarious.

6637
02:46:05,830 --> 02:46:06,070
He's,

6638
02:46:06,070 --> 02:46:07,750
he's got pancreatic cancer and he's,

6639
02:46:07,751 --> 02:46:08,760
he's hilarious.

6640
02:46:08,820 --> 02:46:09,150
And I'm gonna,

6641
02:46:09,150 --> 02:46:09,891
I'm gonna do another one.

6642
02:46:09,891 --> 02:46:09,980
I

6643
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:10,813
got a,

6644
02:46:10,880 --> 02:46:12,050
I got a fucking,

6645
02:46:12,051 --> 02:46:12,660
um,

6646
02:46:12,660 --> 02:46:12,890
uh,

6647
02:46:12,890 --> 02:46:14,480
Anthony Tan back cause
I'm gonna post soon,

6648
02:46:14,481 --> 02:46:16,070
which was a great podcast.

6649
02:46:16,220 --> 02:46:20,450
The Braga and Catelynn show that
music for your Brian Cowen shown.

6650
02:46:20,780 --> 02:46:21,560
Not yet.

6651
02:46:21,560 --> 02:46:22,281
I don't,

6652
02:46:22,281 --> 02:46:22,671
but I'm going to,

6653
02:46:22,671 --> 02:46:24,380
I'm going to start coming
into the studio and,

6654
02:46:24,410 --> 02:46:24,531
oh,

6655
02:46:24,531 --> 02:46:25,850
go to the 10 minute podcast.

6656
02:46:25,880 --> 02:46:26,280
Yes.

6657
02:46:26,280 --> 02:46:27,170
10 minute podcasts.

6658
02:46:27,171 --> 02:46:27,831
It's funny shit,

6659
02:46:27,831 --> 02:46:30,550
Chris Delea and will Sasso Sasso.

6660
02:46:30,551 --> 02:46:31,490
Very funny motherfucker.

6661
02:46:31,730 --> 02:46:33,410
That's the end of this dirty ride.

6662
02:46:33,411 --> 02:46:34,100
Ladies and gentlemen.

6663
02:46:34,100 --> 02:46:35,600
That's probably the end for this week too.

6664
02:46:35,660 --> 02:46:39,230
We were going to do something with a
certain controversial person tomorrow,

6665
02:46:39,231 --> 02:46:40,310
but you know what,

6666
02:46:40,311 --> 02:46:42,260
it's just why,

6667
02:46:42,380 --> 02:46:42,680
why,

6668
02:46:42,680 --> 02:46:43,513
why even bother?

6669
02:46:43,550 --> 02:46:44,360
Yeah.

6670
02:46:44,360 --> 02:46:44,901
We just,

6671
02:46:44,901 --> 02:46:45,560
uh,

6672
02:46:45,560 --> 02:46:46,100
sorry.

6673
02:46:46,100 --> 02:46:47,650
There's too much crazy
going on in this world.

6674
02:46:47,660 --> 02:46:48,440
The small one.

6675
02:46:48,440 --> 02:46:51,320
I don't feel like jumping into
a river of any more crazy.

6676
02:46:51,350 --> 02:46:51,730
Right.

6677
02:46:51,730 --> 02:46:52,563
Um,

6678
02:46:52,610 --> 02:46:53,443
that's it.

6679
02:46:53,840 --> 02:46:55,730
Thanks to the fleshlight
for tuning into this,

6680
02:46:56,630 --> 02:46:59,570
sponsoring this excursion
this weekend here in New York,

6681
02:46:59,571 --> 02:47:00,261
but it's already sold out,

6682
02:47:00,261 --> 02:47:00,440
right?

6683
02:47:00,440 --> 02:47:00,801
Yeah,

6684
02:47:00,801 --> 02:47:01,041
yeah.

6685
02:47:01,041 --> 02:47:03,260
We're in to me and Dunkin and yeah,

6686
02:47:03,261 --> 02:47:04,250
for people who come to the show,

6687
02:47:04,280 --> 02:47:05,113
don't know who's on it.

6688
02:47:05,300 --> 02:47:10,300
It's me and Dunkin and Joey Diaz and
it is the day before there was a UFC,

6689
02:47:11,870 --> 02:47:12,350

6690
02:47:12,350 --> 02:47:12,820

6692
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:16,640
New Jersey and we're at
the grand ballroom and,

6693
02:47:16,710 --> 02:47:17,030
uh,

6694
02:47:17,030 --> 02:47:17,930
the Manhattan Center.

6695
02:47:17,980 --> 02:47:18,800
She'll be a lot of fun.

6696
02:47:18,800 --> 02:47:20,000
I haven't been in New York about,

6697
02:47:20,240 --> 02:47:21,650
it's probably been about like a year.

6698
02:47:22,550 --> 02:47:23,121
Good Times.

6699
02:47:23,121 --> 02:47:24,050
You dirty freaks.

6700
02:47:24,110 --> 02:47:24,740

And for people that are
asking about the kettlebells,

6720
02:47:48,780 --> 02:47:50,630
it's everything's going
to be handled really soon.

6721
02:47:50,630 --> 02:47:52,490
It's just a shipping issue
we're trying to work out.

6722
02:47:52,491 --> 02:47:54,710
So we have to move everything
into a different location.

6723
02:47:55,010 --> 02:47:58,790
So within the next couple of weeks it'll
be all for sale and we'll let you know

6724
02:47:58,880 --> 02:48:00,440
what's going down a lot.

6725
02:48:00,441 --> 02:48:01,520
A lot of cool shit's coming up.

6726
02:48:01,700 --> 02:48:02,730
Good protein part of,

6727
02:48:02,810 --> 02:48:02,980
uh,

6728
02:48:02,980 --> 02:48:05,240
hemp protein powder and
a bunch of other stuff.

6729
02:48:05,630 --> 02:48:06,463
So that's it.

6730
02:48:06,500 --> 02:48:07,070
Um,

6731
02:48:07,070 --> 02:48:09,380
we will see you all Monday.

6732
02:48:09,381 --> 02:48:10,610
Kevin Smith wants to do next week.

6733
02:48:10,640 --> 02:48:11,600
I think I'm going to do his though.

6734
02:48:11,601 --> 02:48:12,470
I think I have to do his,

6735
02:48:12,830 --> 02:48:13,910
I think that's how it works.

6736
02:48:14,030 --> 02:48:14,741
I think we,

6737
02:48:14,741 --> 02:48:15,170
you know,

6738
02:48:15,170 --> 02:48:16,610
cause he did ours last saw.

6739
02:48:16,611 --> 02:48:16,741
Yeah,

6740
02:48:16,741 --> 02:48:17,570
I got to do this.

6741
02:48:17,570 --> 02:48:21,320
So I'll do that next week and we're going
to try to get dice next week to Holla.

6742
02:48:21,710 --> 02:48:21,981
Yeah,

6743
02:48:21,981 --> 02:48:23,540
we should have a bunch of
fun ones coming up soon.

6744
02:48:23,720 --> 02:48:24,141
So,

6745
02:48:24,141 --> 02:48:24,351
uh,

6746
02:48:24,351 --> 02:48:25,010
that's it.

6747
02:48:25,010 --> 02:48:25,430
Uh,

6748
02:48:25,430 --> 02:48:27,260
sorry about the big bomber yesterday,

6749
02:48:27,261 --> 02:48:28,094
Ladies and gentlemen.

6750
02:48:28,190 --> 02:48:29,510
Sometimes things get,

6751
02:48:29,870 --> 02:48:30,830
things go wrong.

6752
02:48:30,960 --> 02:48:31,491
We don't,

6753
02:48:31,491 --> 02:48:33,860
we don't mean that much
more fun to have a cow,

6754
02:48:34,310 --> 02:48:38,270
a calm and cool and interesting and the
situation's been fixed if you day listen

6755
02:48:38,271 --> 02:48:38,570
to it.

6756
02:48:38,570 --> 02:48:39,230
Yeah.

6757
02:48:39,230 --> 02:48:40,420
Ice House is now paying.

6758
02:48:40,440 --> 02:48:41,390
I don't have anything to do with it.

6759
02:48:41,420 --> 02:48:42,080
Yes.

6760
02:48:42,080 --> 02:48:44,230
So there's the [inaudible].

6761
02:48:44,330 --> 02:48:44,781

me down and I'll retweet that and uh,

6763
02:48:48,021 --> 02:48:51,380

cause I'm going to be back in town.

6764
02:48:51,620 --> 02:48:52,470
So uh,

6765
02:48:52,700 --> 02:48:56,270
thank you to everybody that tunes
in and thanks to all your messages,

6766

even your country.

6767
02:48:57,051 --> 02:48:59,030
One's about the little spat yesterday.

6768
02:48:59,031 --> 02:49:02,870
I see a lot of you have opinions
and it's nice that you care.

6769
02:49:02,930 --> 02:49:04,670
Just try to try to be nice,

6770
02:49:04,700 --> 02:49:05,533
try to be friendly,

6771
02:49:05,750 --> 02:49:09,000
try not to be so twatty there's just
too much twatty behavior in this world.

6772
02:49:09,410 --> 02:49:10,740
So next week,

6773
02:49:10,890 --> 02:49:12,510
which is like the 11th,

6774
02:49:12,511 --> 02:49:14,700
we'll probably have another
one at the ice house.

6775
02:49:14,700 --> 02:49:16,110
So if you're planning on flying in from,

6776
02:49:16,260 --> 02:49:17,430
where'd the people flying from?

6777
02:49:17,431 --> 02:49:18,290
We have people hand it out.

6778
02:49:18,360 --> 02:49:21,220
They were going on a comedy
tour and now is a that,

6779
02:49:21,230 --> 02:49:21,450
that,

6780
02:49:21,450 --> 02:49:23,880
that squad show is the
last show of the tour.

6781
02:49:24,060 --> 02:49:26,190
He just wrote me just
to thank me because I,

6782
02:49:26,191 --> 02:49:28,020
I mean that's the guy
with the green shirt.

6783
02:49:28,050 --> 02:49:28,290
Yeah.

6784
02:49:28,290 --> 02:49:28,710
Yeah.

6785
02:49:28,710 --> 02:49:29,101
And uh,

6786
02:49:29,101 --> 02:49:29,491
so we,

6787
02:49:29,491 --> 02:49:30,600
I gave them a tour of the studio,

6788
02:49:30,601 --> 02:49:31,620
which I usually don't do,

6789
02:49:31,710 --> 02:49:33,270
but what's cool about guy?

6790
02:49:33,330 --> 02:49:33,631
Yeah,

6791
02:49:33,631 --> 02:49:34,360
great guy.

6792
02:49:34,360 --> 02:49:36,240
What's cool about that guy
too is that he said that,

6793
02:49:36,241 --> 02:49:36,361
uh,

6794
02:49:36,361 --> 02:49:41,280
he ran into me at south comedy hole a
year ago and I told him to do comedy.

6795
02:49:41,520 --> 02:49:43,470
So he went and did comedy
and now he's a comedian.

6796
02:49:44,400 --> 02:49:45,720
He was thinking about
doing it and I was like,

6797
02:49:45,721 --> 02:49:46,890
go fucking do it man.

6798
02:49:46,920 --> 02:49:49,980
And so he listened to me and
now he's actually comedian.

6799
02:49:50,730 --> 02:49:52,140
He's touring all over the country.

6800
02:49:52,170 --> 02:49:52,640
Wow.

6801
02:49:52,640 --> 02:49:53,473
Crazy.

6802
02:49:53,850 --> 02:49:56,090
Isn't it amazing how fast you
could change fucking life?

6803
02:49:56,091 --> 02:49:56,660
Come on.

6804
02:49:56,660 --> 02:49:57,650
Little inspiration.

6805
02:49:57,651 --> 02:50:01,400
You Pussy fear getting away now you got
to get rid of that fucking Prius and get

6806
02:50:01,401 --> 02:50:02,030
a man's car.

6807
02:50:02,030 --> 02:50:02,570
I'm going to do it.

6808
02:50:02,570 --> 02:50:04,130
We figured out that
shirt for this podcast.

6809
02:50:04,780 --> 02:50:05,870
I have to get a charger charger.

6810
02:50:05,871 --> 02:50:07,310
Is that what I had to gap challenger.

6811
02:50:07,311 --> 02:50:08,690
A champion charge is not bad.

6812
02:50:08,691 --> 02:50:10,820
Two charges got four
doors pretty goddamn fast.

6813
02:50:11,130 --> 02:50:12,200
Excellent Interior.

6814
02:50:12,350 --> 02:50:14,030
The SRTA challenger.

6815
02:50:14,240 --> 02:50:15,110
Very nice car.

6816
02:50:15,170 --> 02:50:17,920
So is the charger both very good
and they're fucking American.

6817
02:50:17,930 --> 02:50:18,763
He can feel good about it.

6818
02:50:18,890 --> 02:50:21,060
Pull up to your dad's house and
the God damned American car.

6819
02:50:21,280 --> 02:50:22,280
He'll be so happy for you.

6820
02:50:22,420 --> 02:50:22,850
I'm writing.

6821
02:50:22,850 --> 02:50:24,420
Would he be son?

6822

02:50:29,170 --> 02:50:30,500
Roll like the penis.

02:50:30,990 --> 02:50:31,250
